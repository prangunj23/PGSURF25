Yom Kippur signals the end of the High Holy Days, a 10-day period of repentance filled with prayer, fasting, and fellowship, which concludes with the Day of Atonement. As the shofar bellows throughout communities this Yom Kippur, we are reminded of how important our faith has been over these past months as we continue to face the challenges posed by the coronavirus. Through the Almighty's love and the power of prayer, we have found renewed strength and understanding to face these unprecedented times with stalwart resolve. Today, as so many seek God's forgiveness and mercy, let us all resolve to incorporate these virtues of compassion into our daily lives. We wish all Jewish people an easy fast and a meaningful and memorable Sabbath of Sabbaths.",

I HAVE BEEN COMING HERE A LONG TIME. WHEN I DIE, I HOPE TO BE BORN IN CHARLESTON. I LIKE THE LOW COUNTRY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I HOPE, THANK YOU, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. THANK YOU. I AM JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND, I WORK FOR CEDRIC RICHMOND. DAVID MACK IS TAKING ME TO SCHOOL. LOOK, I KNOW SOME OF THE OTHER SENATORS CAME TO SEE ME. THEY ARE IN SESSION RIGHT NOW. I THANK THEM FOR MAKING THE EFFORT. SO MANY PEOPLE HERE FOR ME TO SAY THANK YOU TO. I SPOKE TO OUR FOLKS UP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND THEY DID A GOOD JOB. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, THE PEOPLE OF NEVADA ARE WATCHING, AND I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, WE PRAISE THEIR DIVERSITY AS A STATE, AND I WILL BE OUT THERE SEEING THEM SOON. TONIGHT, THOUGH, WE JUST HEARD OF THE FIRST TWO OF 50 STATES. TWO OF THEM. NOT ALL THE NATION, NOT HALF THE NATION, NOT A QUARTER OF THE NATION, NOT 10%. TWO. NOW, WHERE I COME FROM THAT'S THE OPENING BELL, NOT THE CLOSING BELL, AND THE FIGHT TO END DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY IS JUST BEGINNING. JUST BEGINNING. THANK YOU. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IOWA HAS SPOKEN, BUT WE NEED TO HEAR FROM NEVADA, SOUTH CAROLINA, SUPER TUESDAY AND BEYOND. UP UNTIL NOW, WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THE MOST COMMITTED CONSTITUENTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY! AND THE FASTEST-GROWING SEGMENT OF SOCIETY, THE LATINO COMMUNITY! I WANT YOU ALL TO THINK OF A NUMBER. 99.9%, THAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS WHO HAVE NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE IN AMERICA. ONE MORE NUMBER. 99.8%, THE PERCENT OF LATINO VOTERS WHO HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE. SO WHEN YOU HEAR ALL THESE EXPERTS, CABLE TV TALKERS TALKING ABOUT THE RACE, TELL THEM IT AIN'T OVER, MAN, WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. OUR VOTES COUNT, TOO. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE TAKE THIS ELECTION AWAY. I'VE SAID IT A MILLION TIMES, YOU CAN'T BE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE AND CAN'T WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION WITHOUT OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FROM BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS. IT IS SIMPLE. IT'S A NATURAL FACT. IT IS TRUE, ABSOLUTELY TRUE. YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO WON AGAINST INCUMBENTS, FROM JIMMY CARTER TO A GUY NAMED CLINTON, A GUY NAMED OBAMA, MY GOOD FRIEND, GUESS WHAT? THEY HAD OVERWHELMING AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPPORT. WITHOUT IT, NOBODY'S EVER WON. REALLY. AND YOU ALL KNOW. MORE IMPORTANT, YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WIN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT WITHOUT BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS. TOO OFTEN YOUR LOYALTY AND SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT TO THIS PARTY HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED. I'VE NEVER ONCE IN MY CAREER TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED, AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD AS A BIDEN THAT I NEVER, EVER WILL. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT OTHER CANDIDATES WILL DO IN THE FUTURE, THE TENDENCY IS TO LOOK AT THE PAST. I LEFT A LAW FIRM WHEN I WAS A KID WITH A GREAT JOB, AT A FANCY LAW FIRM, TO BECOME A PUBLIC DEFENDER, TO FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY I USED TO WORK IN, ON THE EAST SIDE, BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD A LAWYER. ON THE COUNTY COUNSEL, I FOUGHT AGAINST REDLINING. IN THE U.S. SENATE, I PASSED AN EXTENSION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. AND I HAD THE BACK OF A GREAT PRESIDENT NAMED BARACK OBAMA FOR EIGHT YEARS. BY THE WAY, WE INCREASED ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT. GIVEN A CHANCE, THEY DO JUST AS WELL AS ANYONE ELSE, QUITE FRANKLY BETTER, AND THEY BUILT NEIGHBORHOODS, THEY BUILT COMMUNITIES! WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE FEDERAL POPULATION. SPEAKING OF HBCU'S , I GOT $70 BILLION COMING TO HBCU'S, NOT A JOKE. MINORITY UNIVERSITIES. WE SAVED THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, PASSED OBAMACARE, STOPPED INSURANCE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND ON TOP OF THAT, WE BUILT AN I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU NEED BEST. I LISTEN. YOU ALL KNOW WHAT YOU NEED BEST. WE DON'T LISTEN ENOUGH. WE TAKE FOR GRANTED. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED. WHAT YOUR FAMILIES NEED. WE NEED TO DEFEND AND BUILD ON OBAMACARE. TRUMP WON'S TO GET RID OF IT. EVEN SOME OF THE FOLKS IN MY OWN OUTFIT WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY. BUT I WILL NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN. I WAS PROUD TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VICE PRESIDENT. AND TO BECOME A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND. MY GRANDDAUGHTERS AND HIS DAUGHTERS ARE BEST BUDDIES. I WAS NEVER PROUDER THAN THE DAY WE PASSED OBAMACARE. WE WILL EXPAND THAT. WE WILL GET RID OF ALL THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT HAVE CURTAILED IT. WE WILL INCREASE FUNDING INTO RESEARCH FOR FINDING CURES. IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THERE IS A INCREDIBLE DISPARITY. IT IS SINFUL. IT IS AN INDICTMENT OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. EVERY CHILD HAS THE SAME CAPACITY WHEN THEY ARE BORN. EVERYONE OF THEM HAS THE SAME CAPACITY. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR ZIP CODE OR INCOME LEVEL. I WILL PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS. WE WILL GIVE TEACHERS THE PAYRAISE THEY NEED. WE ARE ALREADY SHORT. WHO WILL GET SHORTCHANGED? YOU'RE DARN RIGHT THEY ARE. WE WILL GIVE OUR TEACHERS A PAY RAISE. WE WILL AND ALL PRIVATE PRISONS. NO MORE JAIL TIME FOR ADDICTION. BUILD MORE TREATMENT FACILITIES. MAKE SURE MARIJUANA CONVICTIONS, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LEGALLY SAY, I HAVE NEVER BEEN ARRESTED. LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS. ALL OF THESE STATES ARE OUT THERE LEGALIZING MARIJUANA. WE SHOULD TAKE A BIG CHUNK OF THOSE PROFITS AND PUT AN END TO PRISONS. WE NEED TO BE A COUNTRY OF SECOND CHANCES. THINK ABOUT IT. WE ALL TALK ABOUT SECOND CHANCES. BUT WHAT DO WE DO? WE SAY YOU ARE DENIED ALL OF THE THINGS THAT CAN HELP YOU. WE WILL GIVE YOU $25 AND A BUS TICKET. WE NEED TO ELIMINATE ALL OF THOSE BARRIERS TO SUCCESS. PEOPLE COMING OUT OF PRISON AND COMING BACK FROM SERVING THEIR TIME, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET PELL GRANTS. HOUSING. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT GIVE THEM A CHANCE. WHILE THEY ARE THERE, WE SHOULD BE TEACHING THEM SKILLS. IT MAKES NO SENSE. WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY AND A GREAT PEOPLE. THE GREATEST WORKERS IN THE WORLD. WE SHOULD GET PAID LIKE WE ARE THE GREATEST WORKERS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE TOO MANY FAMILIES WORKING THEIR TAILS OFF. TOO MANY PEOPLE I KNOW DO WHAT MY DAD DID. WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT. PEOPLE ARE HAVING TROUBLE KEEPING THEIR ROOFS OVER THEIR HEADS. MY DAD LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, I PROMISE YOU, IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT. HE BELIEVED IT. TODAY, THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT LOOK AT THEIR KIDS AND SAY, WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. WE HAVE OVER 50% OF WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE WHO THINK THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER ACHIEVE THE SAME STANDING THEY HAVE. WHAT A GOD AWFUL THING. IT JUST MAKES ME MAD. WE ARE GOING TO INVEST IN OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. IN ROADS AND BRIDGES, BROADBAND, SCHOOL SYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE. WE WILL GET TO THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. I MAKE NO APOLOGIES. IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF EVERYBODY. THE WEALTHY, THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE WORKING CLASS. WHEN EVERYONE DOES BETTER, EVERYTHING WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES HAVE THE SAME CHANCE TO ACCUMULATE WEALTH. YOU LIVE IN A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU HAVE THE SAME WEIGHT , HOUSES THE GUY LIVING ACROSS THE NEIGHBORHOOD. YOURS IS VALUED LESS. YOU PAY MORE FOR INSURANCE. HOW DO YOU GET A CHANCE TO ACCUMULATE WEALTH? THAT IS NOT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FULFILL THE DREAMS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO INVEST IN TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY. THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY RAKED IN THEIR FAVOR. WE WILL INVESTED IN FAMILIES INSTEAD. I REALLY MEAN IT. I HAVE DONE IT. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT WE CAN GET DONE IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. FIRST, WE HAVE TO BE DONALD TRUMP. WHEN THOSE FOLKS CAME OUT IN CHARLOTTESVILLE CARRYING THOSE TORCHES, I NEVER WOULD'VE LEAPT IT. , BELIEVED IT. SCREECHING HATE. CARRYING NAZI BANNERS. CHANTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT WAS CHANTED IN THE STREETS OF GERMANY. THAT IS THAT THEY JILL AND I KNEW, AND MY GRANDCHILDREN KNEW, WE HAD NO CHANCE BUT TO RUN. I THOUGHT WE HAD FINALLY TURNED A CORNER. I HAD BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED ALL OF MY LIFE. BUT I LEARNED HATE DOES NOT GO AWAY. IT JUST HIDES. THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE NOTHING BUT BREATHE OXYGEN INTO THAT HATE. BRING IT OUT FROM UNDER THE ROCKS. AT HIS RALLIES, HE SPREADS THE MESSAGE OF PREJUDICE AND DIVISION. IN THE WHITE HOUSE, HE WELCOME AND SEND GUN MANUFACTURERS WHY , WHILE I KIDS ARE BEING GUNNED DOWN IN THE STREETS AND IN SCHOOLS. HE HAS 35 STATES SUPPRESSING THE BOAT, PRIMARILY TO KEEP PRODUCT , BLACK FOLKS AND BROWN FOLKS FROM VOTING. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. IT HAS TO STOP. I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE FIGHTING FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, SOCIAL JUSTICE. THIS DAY, 30 YEARS AGO, NELSON MANDELA WALKED OUT OF PRISON. I HAD THE GREAT HONOR OF MEETING HIM. HE WALKED IN. THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING I HAVE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE. HE SAID THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO COME AND SEE ME. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN CHAOS. BUT WHAT DID HE DO? HE IS A SAMPLE I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT. PEOPLE ASKED ME IF I WILL HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST TRUMP FOR GOING AFTER MY SON. IT IS NOT ABOUT ME AND MY SON. THAT MAKES ME ANGRY. PRESIDENTS CANNOT JUST FIGHT. THEY HAVE TO DEAL. WE HAVE TO DO IT WITH THE SAME KIND OF COURAGE AND CONVICTION. BY THE WAY, I AM NOT NELSON MANDELA. I AM NOT MAKING THAT COMPARISON. ALL OF YOU MINISTERS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT IS THE KIND OF CONVICTION WE NEED TO MOVE THIS NATION FORWARD. LORD, GIVE ME THE ABILITY TO CLIMB. TOGETHER WE WILL BE DONALD TRUMP. JEFF AND AND ANN SUPPORT OUR CAMPAIGN. LET'S GET TO WORK.

Would you all join me in thanking the 13th Administrator of NASA, Jim Bridenstine, for the great job he's doing? (Applause.) To Secretary Wilbur Ross, Chairman Moran, Senator Cramer, Congressman Lucas, Congresswoman Horn, Congressman Babin and members of the House Science Committee , to all the members of Congress who are with us here today, thank you for supporting a renewed American leadership in space. Join me in thanking all these great members of the House and Senate. (Applause.) And to all of you leaders in industry, the archivists , all of you that have made this evening possible , especially the extraordinary filmmakers who I know we'll see their handiwork in just a few minutes , it really is an honor to be here today. The world premiere of Apollo 11: First Steps Edition. Welcome all. It is great to be with you. (Applause.) And let me say, as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a man who is committed to securing American leadership on Earth and in the boundless expanse of space, whose vision has enlivened America's commitment to human space exploration. I bring greetings and gratitude to all of you from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And I always wait to introduce the highest-ranking official last. So join me in welcoming an aviator, an educator, a Marine Corps mom, and my wife of 33 years , the Second Lady of the United States of America, Karen Pence. (Applause.) You know, Karen and I are , we're pretty passionate about space. In fact, when our kids were very young , and they're all in their twenties right now; one is in the military, two are still in graduate school , we actually , we actually vacationed at Cape Canaveral, just so we could take the kids to see the rockets. So we're honored to be with all of you today in this incredible and historic place. Speaking of which, allow me to thank our host tonight. You already heard from her, but Dr. Ellen Stofan and all the wonderful, dedicated men and women at the National Air and Space Museum. This is the most popular museum in the United States and one of the most popular museums in the world. Thank you, Dr. Stofan. Thank you for your great leadership and stewardship of this national treasure. (Applause.) It really is amazing to be here, standing here before you , the 'Spirit of St. Louis' just above us, that made that transatlantic flight. And then there's 'Glamorous Glennis' just above us, that broke the sound barrier. And then this lunar module behind me. It's amazing to think, just in my lifetime, how far America has come. And here at this great museum, we preserve that legacy. But as I just told Dr. Stofan, thanks to President Trump's leadership, they're going to have to build a new wing because we're going to make all new American history in the vast expanse of space. (Applause.) Not that it should be a surprise. In his Inaugural Address to the nation two years ago, President Trump said that America stands, in his words, 'at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space.' What the President recognized, what you all recognize is America has always been a nation of restless pioneers , ever striving to explore uncharted territories, reach new horizons, venture into the unknown, and expand the boundaries of human knowledge. But it was in 1961 when another President, John F. Kennedy, laid out a vision for American human space exploration. He expressed those immortal words, laying forth a goal for the nation, that, quote, 'before this decade is out landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.' It was anything but easy. Literally hundreds of thousands of engineers, scientists, technicians worked around the clock to make it possible , planning each detail and preparing every possibility. And just 8 years later , 50 years ago this July , Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins made it happen and proved that the United States can do anything we put our mind to, when we put the first man on the moon. (Applause.) And tonight, we're going to see some never-before-seen footage of those incredible moments , and I can't wait , including when that 'one small step' for a man became 'one giant leap for mankind.' The crew of Apollo 11 inspired a generation of Americans and people all over the world. They are giants on whose shoulders we stand , paving our way into the heavens and giving us the courage to dream bigger, to go farther, with the confidence that we can accomplish whatever we set our minds to. So as we prepare to mark this golden anniversary of their mission later this year, we honor their legacy , the legacy of Apollo 11 , by celebrating it in moments like this. And there will be many celebrations over the course of the year. But I submit to you that we believe we also honor their legacy by renewing our commitment to American leadership in space. (Applause.) As President Trump said, 'It is America's destiny to be the leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown.' And over the past two years, I'm pleased to report to you that we've begun writing the next chapter of that adventure with ingenuity and incredible Americans all across this nation. In our first year, after it had lain dormant for nearly a quarter of a century, I'm proud to say that President Trump kept his word to the American people back in 2016, and he revived the National Space Council to coordinate all space activities across a whole-of-government approach. And it's my great honor to serve as Chairman, as previous Vice Presidents have done. We also looked beyond the halls of government for input and guidance, partnering with businesses represented here so well to accelerate innovation across the space enterprise. And we're honored to be joined this evening by several members of what we call our 'User Advisory Group.' We thought it was imperative that we brought together the best and brightest men and women in the nation with expertise in the space enterprise. And these men and women have gathered from some of the most incredible companies in this country to bring their expertise. And they join us here today , members of the User Advisory Group. Would you join me in giving a round of applause for all the members of the UAG? (Applause.) I got Dr. Mary Lynne Dittmar, the President of the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration; Dr. Bud Peterson, the President of Georgia Institute of Technology; and Eric Stallmer, the President of Commercial Space Federation; and Mandy Vox , President of VOX Space. Give them all a round of applause because they're helping to guide renewed American leadership in space. (Applause.) And while we're at it, I couldn't help , I couldn't help but take the opportunity to invite you to recognize some extraordinary people who are with us today. One was a veteran , one was a veteran of three different space shuttle missions. She's now the Director of the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Join me in welcoming Astronaut Janet Kavandi, who is with us today. Janet, thank you. (Applause.) We're also joined by a member of that User Advisory Group, who is currently serving as the Director of Space and Technology at Nova Systems. Was the commander of Space Shuttle flights STS-120. Colonel Pamela Melroy, where are you? Astronaut and Colonel Pamela Melroy. (Applause.) And finally, let me recognize a member of the crew of the final mission of the Space Shuttle. She's spent more than 144 days in orbit, and she is an incredible testament to the American Astronaut Corps. Astronaut Sandy Magnus is with us here today. Sandy, thank you. (Applause.) I've got to tell you the progress we've made. In December of 2017, as a result of the work of the National Space Council, President Trump signed Space Policy Directive-1, where we made it the policy of the United States of America to return to the moon with the goal of one day putting Americans on Mars. (Applause.) And I'm proud to report we're on track. This year, the United States will once again send American astronauts into space on American rockets, from American soil. (Applause.) Just two months ago, during a meeting of the National Space Council down at 'Rocket City,' in Huntsville, Alabama, it was also my privilege to announce what Jim Bridenstine just reflected on: that, at President Trump's direction, it is the policy of the United States that we will return to the moon within the next five years, and the first woman and the next man on the moon will be an American. (Applause.) So we've made great strides in advancing the President's bold new vision for American leadership in space , to push us farther and faster and higher than ever before. And unlike in years past, we have the budgets to match. As Administrator Bridenstine just said, we just sent to Capitol Hill a budget request to put , would put real substance behind the President's vision. And I want to thank these members of Congress for their stalwart support. Well, as I started to come up here, Karen and I were chatting, and she reminded me that you all didn't come here to hear me; you came here to see a movie. (Laughter.) So I want to get out of your way and let you enjoy that. But it's impossible to come to a moment like this, an evening like this, and not be incredibly inspired. And I want to thank the National Air and Space Museum again for your hospitality. I want to thank Administrator Bridenstine for the great work he's doing at NASA. And I want to thank all of you for the enthusiasm that all of you are showing. Everywhere I go in this country, people are getting it again. People understand that America has made great history leading human exploration in space. But with your support, with President Trump's leadership, with the strong support of these outstanding members of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, with the courage of a new generation of astronauts, and with God's help, I know America will once again astound the world with how we lead in space. So thank you very much. God bless you. And enjoy the movie. (Applause.)",

But the governor wanted it to be, I guess, freedom of speech: 250 people. And rather than canceling, I'm going to see the people. Probably a lot of people are going to be showing up anyway. But we're going to have 25,000, at least. You have a very big crowd here. We have a big crowd everywhere. There's something going on that's very exciting.

So under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded. 33.1% fastest ever recorded Way created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months. That's a record. And while foreign nations are in freefall, we are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they're better off today than they were four years ago. That's under the auspices of Barack Hussein Obama on a sleepy Joe Biden. You're not gonna wanna have Joe Biden. You know, if we had see the media, look at all the media back there, if we had, if they had to cover, if they had to cover him for two months, let's say we have to bring the president back. We have to bring. We have to bring Trump back. They would be out of business. They would be out of business that Biden, Harris and the radical Left gain power. They will collapse our economy and send your nation this wonderful nation into a depression that was, you know they want. It is the only guy I have ever seen who runs by saying we will. He doesn't say it like that. He goes, who you way will raise your taxes. I never heard that before. You know, I've covered politicians. I've been friends of politicians. I've been enemies also, but I've never seen somebody saying we will raise your taxes. They want to give you the largest tax increase in the history of our country. And we can't let we can't let that happen. So get out and vote tomorrow. It's the biggest. Tomorrow will be, I think will be the most important election in the history of our country. And I never thought I'd say that. I never thought I'd say so. Get out and vote. Sleepy. Joe Biden will raise your taxes. $4 trillion massively increase your regulations. Shut down your farms. Closed down your factories. How is he doing so far? Send your jobs overseas. They start booing him. I don't know. Is this guy really thinking about? I mean, could he really win? Are we serious about this? No, I didn't. Thanks. What the hell is going on to see? Serious guy has no clue. He shot some people Have shot. He's shot. Did you see him today with the the Aviators? Right. The glasses. Right. Came on. Very tough. He's very agitated, you know, It's like sort of like going crazy, I think. Destroy the suburbs, dissolve your borders, terminate religious liberty, outlaw private healthcare. Confiscate your gun. Second Amendment is a deep trouble. Not with me. It's not. Hasn't you notice it hasn't been touched right? It hasn't been touched. You think that was easy? It wasn't easy and indoctrinate your Children with anti American lies. So I just signed an executive order to teach our students pro American values her, oh, American values. Biden is vowed to abolish the American oil and natural gas industries and ban fracking. Now, from your standpoint, you don't like it because you don't want energy costs going up right. That's what he dio. Biden's energy band will send every state into crushing poverty from Wisconsin to Michigan. Nevada, Pennsylvania, as long as I am president will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. We are right and we will remain energy independent. You know, we're energy independent. We don't need foreign nations anymore. But we have good relationships in the Middle East. You know, we're we're doing peace in the Middle East. You believe it? No blood in the sand. Peace in the Middle East. Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure on foreign wars. You know, they call them the endless foreign wars. Countries that many of you have never heard about. What? What? Uh, yeah, E. Yeah. I don't know. I think we're doing fine with this Mike, right? I don't want to put this guy under pressure. You're on stage. You got 27,000 people watching you. Don't get nervous. No, he's not nervous. He's a professional. I'll give you the name of his company. Never used that company now. No, it's fine. Don't worry about it. This is okay. This isn't bad. Do you want toe? Oh, you want to just put it in there? Well, that is it. The same. Micah's the other one. It's a different mike. That means that was supposed to be better, right? That's not good. All right. Okay. We'll take that sucker out of there. Right. Congratulations. Yeah. How is he doing? He's doing a good job. Come on. Mhm. Now we're back where we started. See? The whole deal? We're right back where we started. I take the mic out. Okay? Okay. You know what? And then I won't pay the bill of the, you know, company that this is crazy microphone and they'll do a story. Trump is Ah, horrible human being. He doesn't pay a bill. No, I don't like to pay bills When people do a bad job, you don't either. But I don't know. They look like nice people. They come from Kenosha. So I'm gonna pay the bill anyway. What the hell? You know, At least I prove one thing, You know, Did you ever see where I lifted last of water? And I wear the red tie of this sort of expensive And, you know, you don't like to spill water on the red tie, right? So sometimes I'll use two hands and because I want to catch the water because I want to save the time because I'm basically cheap, you know? So I'll take the water to go like this. I'll take a little sip and they'll say, there's something wrong with him. There's something they said, No, I'm trying to save. So I got like this. So now, by holding a mic all night long like this, you're gonna say, Well, there's nothing wrong with that right hand or left hand. Now, did you ever hear that there's something wrong? You can't lift a glass of water and I have no problem with that someday. I may like Joe, but I don't have any problems. Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Wisconsin lost half of your manufacturer. Think of it. You lost half of your manufacturing jobs after the betrayals. These were betrayals by a lot of people, and Biden was one of them. He's a corrupt politician, and he sold out Wisconsin to China. But he's a corrupt politician, and these people never told you that. And they don't want to write about it. And big Tech doesn't want to talk about it. And it's off bounds and they're not allowed to talk. And we have suppression. We have suppression. This is a media suppression, the likes of which nobody has ever seen. And if you take a look, you've never seen anything like it. Yeah, the last famous last words, right? But no, nobody's ever seen anything like it. You know. His son walks in. His son had no job. He left the military. Unfortunately, it wasn't good. And then what happens is the father becomes vice president on this kid becomes like a human vacuum cleaner. He follows the father into countries dead. Who are you going to today? Well, let's go to China. And he's a vacuum cleaner. Follows. The father takes in money, right? It's terrible. They give him $1.5 billion.1.5 billion one. And I think of it $1.5 billion. And he gets fees off that millions of dollars a year. There's only one problem. He has no experience investing money. They give him the money. They gave him the money after 10 minutes. I think our Congress has to take a look at that. What do you think, fellas? I think you're gonna have to look at it. Can you imagine? You don't have a lot of my kids here tonight. Can you imagine if my kids said your dad? I got a billion and a half dollars from China. Oh, I don't think they want to write about that. The fake news. Do you think they'd right about that? Then he gets $3.5 million from the mayor of Moscow's wife. Right? What did he get that for? Remember I asked that at the debate. The first debate. I said it Chris Wallace thought it was an inappropriate question. Really? I think you think Chris Wallace? No. I must tell you, I think Kristen did a better job. Kristen Welker, right? I don't mean she was perfect. Actually. Some people said she wasn't really very nice. I thought she was nice. Relatively speaking. She was great for what I get. How about the one Savannah Guthrie? You see that one? That was that was another beautiful live at nine o'clock. She's jumping out of a chair. She's like going crazy. But we all do. Well, you know, I don't get questions like he gets. He gets, sir. What kind of ice cream are you? Did you see that? They never asked me questions like that in 2016. Wisconsin voted to fire this, corrupt it. And really, it's like corrupt, corrupt political establishment, right? And you elected an outsider is president who is finally putting America first, finally putting America on. If I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician, right? If I don't always play by the rules of the Washington establishment is because I was elected to fight for you and nobody has ever fought harder for you than I am. I will tell you noy I when the violent mob came to Kenosha Biden oppose sending in the National Guard. Of course You remember this, right? He didn't. He didn't want to send in the guard. He thought it was terrible. Descend in the guard and we sent in the guard and we saved Kenosha. We saved those. I said, You know, I think Kenosha is gonna like May. We did a good job. I wish they sent him in a little bit earlier, right? If we hadn't been a little bit earlier, But that's okay. That's okay, But we sent in and how How good did the guard do, though? Did we do the job? Did they dio Biden and Kamala? Does anybody know who Kamala is? That's this wonderful woman. She wants to be your first female president? I don't think so. I don't think so. You know, that's a good reason not to vote for Sleepy Joe to right. You don't want to do that. You wanna have? We all want to see that happen someday. But we don't want this to be the one right, But they're waging war in our police. You know that your police with you, we have a lot of police here tonight. I recognize that because because I went and I met all of the police. I met a lot of great police, federal police. I met the whole group. And you have great police. I agree with that. But I stand with the heroes of law enforcement, and I was honored to be endorsed by Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth. Thank you, David. Wherever you may be. Thank you, David. That was so nice. That was so nice. They like you out there. David. That's very good. Appreciate it, David. Thank you very much. And as I'm sure you've heard, Biden's far left supporters are threatening to loot and riot tomorrow If they don't get their way. They don't get their way already. David. Everybody ready it, Z if they know we're ready, and if they know we're not playing games, they won't even be here. They won't show up, you know, it's like I brought an old law into existence when I saw them going around all over the country knocking down statues, right and monuments and we signed. We brought it in and I signed it updated and signed it. 10 years in prison. If you're knocked down a statue or monument on, you don't see it anymore. They look and they say, Oh would like to knock that one down. But you know what? 10 years is too much. Darling, Let's leave now. This is yet more evidence why the radical left cannot be trusted with power. We strongly condemn political violence. We condemn it and we condemn it strongly. Biden must tell his supporters he doesn't really have supporters. Let's face it, he doesn't have supporters. The guy shot, he doesn't have. There's There's an ideology that has supporters, and he's just a vessel, you know, He happened to be the one that got through because Elizabeth Warren, instead of getting out like she should have and letting Bernie take it. Bernie, I got to tell you, he is a great loser. He really is. He loses. It happened with Hillary, and it happened with Elizabeth Warren. What she did was incredible, you know, that's a similar philosophy, but Biden ended up being there. Biden end up being there, and that's the way it is that he has to tell his supporters. And I think you're going to see something. Look at the people over Here they go. Hello? Can you actually hear this? Can you hear this thing? Because it is the worst microphone I've ever used in my life. Can you actually hear me over there? They can in the back, all the way back. That's good. Thank you. I can't believe it. It sounds terrible to me. His silence is that it doesn't sound great right to me. It doesn't sound right. It's all right. Good. You know what? Keep saying it. That Bill, he just don't pay him. Don't pay him. You hear that, Johnny? Don't pay the damn bill, will you please? A piece of garbage they gave him. It's not even the first rate back. The one the good one is. It's put to rest. We put it to rest. The good one. We put the rest, all right. Don't pay him. But as president, I will ensure peace and order in this country. We're going to have peace and order, and you're gonna have a day tomorrow. The likes of which I think people haven't seen in a long time. A long time you're gonna have a red way is gonna be a beautiful sight. And you know what we have a lot of we have. We actually have a country that outside of a radical group, and this is a radical group, but we have a country that's very well united. When you look at a group of people like this, it's incredible. And I go from here I go. I told you, Grand Rapids, we have. They say they have 40 50,000 people in Grand Rapids last night in Florida. We have 45,000 people. No problem. Everybody's in love. Everybody loves our country. It's a beautiful thing. I'm telling you this there's a lot of unity. We just don't complain, you know, we don't complain. We just go out and do what we have to do. But, you know, when we were having that incredible run, we were doing the best. And now we're almost at that same point. It will be there soon, but our country was uniting. We were getting calls. We had the best employment numbers ever. African American, Asian American, Hispanic, American. And we were getting calls like Maybe it's time we get together, you know, because success brings people together. Success brings people together. And you're going to see that happening because we're having numbers the likes of which we've never had before. 33. Think of a 33.1% nobody's ever had that the highest was 1952 and it was less than half of that number. So rioting, looting and arson will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I'm just telling you that right now, I'm telling you that right now that if people are you know, I hate to see where they put boards up on a window. This shouldn't be that it shouldn't be that. But we are going. We are a country of law and order. We have to pay, we are and people and you notice. I hate to say it, but it's true. This is a these Air Democrat. Mayors and governors. He's a Democrat. Run cities and states. They're the ones. If you look at New York and Chicago and how about Portland, which is anarchist? We could solve that problem. We tell the governor you want us to solve the problem. We solve it in 30 minutes. We solved it in Seattle. We went in. We were going to go in the morning. We announced we're going in in the morning and they just raised their hands and they left the night before. Then we did a great job in, uh, you know, Minneapolis. We did a great job. We're gonna win Minnesota for two reasons. We did a great job now. They could have called. They could have let us do it a week and a half. Fairly. That would have been nice, you know? Right. So that the announcer remember the anchor you looked over says this is a peaceful protest. Yeah. Thank you. What a group. What a group. What a group. I've gotten to know this state very well. You know? You surprised, You know, you're the one that put us over the top. You know that, right? Remember way were waiting for Pennsylvania four years ago. We're waiting for Pennsylvania. They didn't want to call it. Oh, they were going crazy. These people, they were crying. They didn't know what the hell was happening. They said this will be a very short evening for Donald Trump. Four years ago, right? and they were just like, Oh, they were looking for would remember the woman crying in the convention center that beautiful Remember the woman? He was going crazy glasses, heads God, she was She's. I wonder where she is right now. She's They put her away. No, no, This was not a person that I was easily going to convince to be on my side. I think two is going crazy. But remember the beginning. They should. Everyone's happy. Everyone's thrilled. They spent a fortune. It was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. In terms of the stage, they had a shape like the United States. Hello back there. You okay? But that was a hell of an evening. And this evening is going to be a I'm telling you tomorrow it's going to be I can't say bigger. There was. Was there ever anything is big? I'll tell you, the election is more important, but the evening will be as good or almost a good. And that's okay too. But that was the first right? That was the first. That was some of the things that was some evening. He won Florida. He won Ohio. He won it all. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. On because of the microphone, we are giving you back half of your admission price. But considering that you paid nothing, I'm sorry. You're getting nothing. The price is right. No, it's fine. But, you know, But wasn't that something, though? Where they say that the evening begins and they say this is gonna be very quick. You know what happened? They did exit polls, and a lot of the people said none of your business. So who did you vote for? None of your business. That meant Trump. And they did 44%. You know that 44% of the people said none of your business, and that meant chop. They call it the none of your business vote, but almost all of them. I think maybe all of them were trump, so they didn't count them. So they said, Oh, this is gonna be a blowout tonight. But they didn't realize. You know, these pollsters haven't been doing so good with May, and we blew it out. It was incredible. It started with Ohio. Remember? We're gonna do great in Ohio tomorrow too. By the way, great place Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. That's a big state. You know, I heard for a year when we're doing this, you cannot win unless you win the state of Ohio every night. They did it. And then all of a sudden, poll numbers started coming out that I was leading, you know, But anyway, but they thought I was gonna win by one point. I won by eight. They said he won Ohio. He won by eight points. What the hell is going on here? That's a lot. And then they said, Oh, no! Oh, no. Please don't tell me this. Donald Thas won the state of Florida. No, no, no. Well, please, Please, please, Please remember Martha Raddatz, ABC? Oh, my God. Please, Please don't tell me this. Oh, no, I'm a neutral. I'm very neutral. I don't. Please, Martha. Neutral, please. The tears. Wiping them away quickly. No. Then we won Florida. Then we won Georgia. Then we went South Carolina. Then we won. The firewall was remembered. North Carolina. That's the firewall. We're gonna win North Carolina. They have They put so much money into North Carolina. But we had an asset from North Carolina named Lara. Laura Lara Trump married to married to the legendary Eric Trump. Where are you? Are you two there? Way had a We had a big asset there, Laura Jumping. She knew that area so well. And they loved her so much. They loved her so much. And they just had another baby. And they named the Baby Carolina. They named the Baby Carolina. And I tell you, though, but I said we have to give South Carolina some credit, too. For that. Bring them up. Come on up! Get over! Come on, Bring them up. Bring them up! Great. Come on. Come on, Laura. This one, They love her. And North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania. And they lover in Wisconsin to here you go. Thank you very much. Thank you, honey. Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Winner. They're doing a good job. They're working hard. I'll tell you, they're all working hard. They're all working hard. We have a whole group of families, like a family reunion tonight. Now, well, you know, this is now the big time, because tomorrow is the big day and we have one more stop to actually, you know, I did five today, but I could say I could say I did six. Because in Miami, we finished it close to two o'clock in the morning. So let's added six today. Okay? After Grand Rapids, Joe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media and powerful special interests. You know that they own him. They control him, and they know he will always do their bidding. And when he raises $300 million for this campaign in a short period of time, ask him. What deals did you have to make? Because I would be the greatest fundraiser of all time. I can call the Wall Street guys. I know him. All I could say, Send me $25 million immediately, please. Yes, sir. Mr President, I will. But you know, once you do that, you're totally compromised. You can't do anything properly once you do that. And I say, I don't want to do that. And we did very well with the fundraising stuff, but a lot of it came in small donations. First time a Republican has ever raised a lot of money with small donations, like $61 average or something like that. Every corrupt force in American life has betrayed you and hurt you. And they're all supported by Joe Biden, the failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars. They're supported by Sleepy Joe Biden, the career politicians that offshored your industries and you had plenty offshored and decimated your factories. They support Joe Biden, the open borders lobbyists, all the people that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs, gangs and crime. And you know a lot about that. They support Joe Biden, the anti American radicals defaming our noble history, heritage and heroes. They support Joe Biden. That's cancel culture. We don't believe in cancel culture Dio antifa and the riders and looters and Marxist and left wing extremists. They all support Joe Biden. This election comes down to a simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the corrupt and selfish political clor do you want to be governed by the American people? It's what it's all about the American people. They've taken that away. They've taken it away. And what's going on with big tech and what's going on with the media is nobody has ever seen anything like it. There's never been anything like it. Nobody has seen anything like it where you know you can't have a you can't have. You can't have a scandal if there's nothing written about, it is pretty tough. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalist and communists and socialists and wealthy liberal hypocrites hypocrites who want a silent sensor cancel and punish you. These are riel really trouble if you want your Children to be safe, if you want your values to be respected, if you want your If you wanna be just treated with dignity and respect, then I am asking you tomorrow to go out. Vote for your all time favorite president way. Still have work, Thio. Thank you. Thank you. Remember what I said four years ago? I am your voice and we will all together make America great again. That's what we're doing. That's what we've done for the last four years. The depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me. Can you imagine if they didn't do the hoax? The Russia Russia hooks, right? Russia, Russia, Russia. How about shift getting up the other day? The laptop from hell, Right? That's Where's Hunter? Where's hunters out there? Where's Hunter? Oh, he's in a country. I say. His father just left. The country is going to scam them for a couple of bucks. Where is Hunter? Nobody's got the laptop from hell and shift Got up with the watermelon head, right? Like a watermelon. And he goes, This was produced by Russia. These people are crazy, I tell you. Hey, what a crazy bunch! But they know I don't answer to them. My answer to you It's true. I Look, I didn't need this. I didn't need this. I had a very nice life. I had a very nice life. But you know what? It's the greatest thing I ever did because no administration, no president. In the 1st 3.5 years, the biggest tax cut in history, the biggest regulation cuts rebuilding our military. Look at what we've done. Look at what we've done. Our vets just gave a 91% approval rating, the highest in history, the highest in history. Now look at what we have done. Space Force. I never even talked about space for us. I never talked. I realized we needed it. After I was in office, I looked. I saw I saw Rush. I saw China. I said, We need space for first time in 74 years. New one. Write a new one. Right, Congressman, we did. We did a great job on it. Together we will defeat the corrupt establishment. We will dethrone the failed political class. We will drain the Washington Swamp and we will save the American dream. A dream for your Children, your grandchildren, right. A dream for your Children and your grandchildren. We have the energy and the people to prove the corrupt media wrong. And that's what we have. We have an energy like no movement has ever had in this country. You know, uh, somebody would go in and do well in New Hampshire is an example. I'm thinking about one because I have a lot of respect for him. He did well, came in second in the primary, and he became famous for many years. What we did is we want all the primaries. We won everything and then we won the presidency. No, there's never been a movement like this, and now they go after us illegally. They spied on our campaign. Our campaign is not my our campaign. They tried Thio take out a duly elected president of the United States and we caught them and we caught them and let's see what happens to them. And you know who is a part of it. Barack Hussein, Obama and Sleepy Joe Budden and plenty of others like Comey, etcetera but plenty of others. But they were a part of it. So now we'll see what happens, right? We're going to see we're going to see what happens. So but you have to get out and vote is the biggest thing. Get out and vote. Who, by the way, who's already voted? All right, that's it. But we have a tendency to vote on election day of Republicans. So let me ask you, who is planning to vote tomorrow? Very important. Very important. Is anybody planning to vote for sleepy Joe Biden? Please raise your Does anybody have the courage? Raise you alright? Yeah. Get out and vote. Well, that's good. That's a lot of people. So a lot of you vote a little bit early then. Do you trust the ballot system? Do you do early voting or do you do with the ballot early? I like early, but earliest good. Early is good. Ballot is not good. We got a very horrible, horrible ruling from the Supreme Court of the United States. A ruling that puts our country in danger. Actually, on Pennsylvania, they have so much time to do this thing. Oh, let them put their votes in and give them plenty of time. You know we have a date. It's called November 3rd. We don't have a date that says many days later we don't have a date that says you're allowed. Thio, go and start. You know, putting your vote in later and we can tabulate it later. Take your time. The whole world is waiting to find out, and there's great danger in that number one. There's danger that there's a lot of shenanigans that go on from that time forth. There's a lot of shenanigans, and then there's a lot of bad things that can happen with with the streets. I mean, you're gonna have a population that's going to be very, very angry, and you just can't do that. That is such a dangerous decision that is such a disappointment. When I heard that decision, it's a terrible decision. Just you go take a look at it and I know you people to take you to look at it. But there's not a decision that I've ever heard of, like that where people, if you wanna put your ballot in and if you want, you go and you put it in two or three or four weeks early, you don't going. But yeah, he said. You had a whole year. You had a lot of time. You had a lot of time. So they say, Oh, this is so terrible. You know, they gave him extra time and then all the time, So now there were gonna be all waiting around because Pennsylvania We're gonna win Pennsylvania. It's a great state. But you know, it's didn't like you. It's in a total shut down. They shut it down. The governor is a Democrat. He shut it down. It'll probably open on the fourth. It will open up the hill announced. Ladies and gentlemen, now that the election's over, we're gonna open it up. Right? But you can't do that. That's a very, very dangerous decision by the Supreme Court. I guess it was a political decision. I don't know what it was. I don't know what they were thinking. And you know what? Maybe I should maybe I shouldn't be speaking this way. I'm very disappointed on behalf of this country that a thing like this could happen because we could be waiting for weeks before we ever find out what's going on. The whole world is waiting for this decision. It's a very sad It's a very sad thing and hopefully it's going to be changed. Hopefully their wisdom and they have wisdom. Hopefully their wisdom will prevail and they'll do something and lawyers will be going in and they'll be fighting and, you know, but people, in fact, it's all over television tonight. I'm coming from place to place and I'm the good thing about Air Force One. It's got more televisions and any hotel room in the world. Okay, you have them on the floors you have on the ceilings, you have them all over and you see the comments that are being made about the decision and some of the pros. They're saying there's a very dangerous decision for our country because so many things, I mean, they're going to say, Well, how Maney votes short our way. We need 6000 votes. Well, let's take 6000 of these. We'll put them over here. Let's take 6000 of these. It's going to be cheating. It's going to be cheating. It's like they're putting these people. And you know what? We don't consider the people that have been running elections in Philadelphia. To be very honest, we've had a lot of problems with Philadelphia, so that's the story. And hopefully that will be changed. And I'm sure the people would say, Oh, you shouldn't speak that way about the Supreme Court. We've had so many bad decisions out of the Supreme Court that I will speak that way, and that's the way it is. This election is also a choice between a deadly Biden locked down and a safe vaccine that ends. And by the way, we're rounding the turn anyway. But we have great vaccines. We have great vaccines coming. We have great vaccines coming, and it's a lot of good things were happening. And you know, when you look at the therapeutics Excuse me, I'm right here. No, I don't think the therapeutic help. May. I don't think I needed it. I'm glad I got it right, Regeneron. We're gonna make it available free to anybody that needs it. We're making it available free to anybody that needs it free. But I'll tell you what. I'm sure I didn't because I'm you know, I'm a perfect physical specimen and I am considered very, very young. I'm considered young for my age. No, I'm a perfect specimen. I'm in perfect shape. So I'm sure I would have thrown it away, But no, but I had it. And the next morning I was not feeling good at all. I tell you, the doctor said, sir, I hate to say it. You've just tested positive. I said, Doc, Sean, Great doctor. White House Doctor. I said, Sean, tell me, what does that mean? Tested positive For what? Sir? You've tested positive for the China plague. He used it much nicer and he said Co vid He said, Cove in. You know, it's got about 37 names. You know that we could. David, I always like to have a China in there because I like to be accurate. But But he said So you've tested positive for Kobe, said, I'm in the middle of the campaign. I can't be positive for covert. And so anyway, so I Waas and I didn't feel too good, and the first lady had it. At least now you know that all those rumors is that she lives in Virginia. Separate. I mean, at least now you know she lives in the White House because he got it. Probably for me or whatever. I don't know what the hell you know. Do you ever hear the first lady lives in Virginia in a beautiful house over a river or something? No, no. She lives here, but at least that and then I know people love the first lady. They love them. Lady stew. They love the first lady. It's true. They love her. She's doing a good job. They love that whole family back there. They love that family back there. Great family. Hi, Tiffany. So So then. So Melania has it, But she knocked it out pretty good. And I did a great job, you know, I was surrounded by these doctors. 12 doctors. I've told the story. Each one was a specialist. Johns Hopkins. Walter Reed Medical Center is incredible. You know, that's our military center. It's incredible. And I'm surrounded, right? I'm just surrounded by these brilliant doctors. One thing when you're president, you get a lot of doctors, and each doctor grabbed a different part of my body and I said, I don't like this at all, But they told me about this one thing and I said, I really do. I like it. I really But it was very, you know, a little bit early. What we've done with getting it through the FDA has been incredible. Biden wouldn't have this stuff done for years. We had his chance with the swine flu and totally blew it right. It was a disaster. It was a disaster. Anyway. So I wake up the next morning and I'm telling you, I felt like Superman. I was so I wanted to get out. I said, give me another trade deal to re negotiate that these clowns have screwed up. Give me a trade deal to re negotiate. And where am I supposed to be? Well, sir, could you take it easy for a couple of days? And people are sort of amazed I've done these things. I mean, I do them these air. Not easy to do. Especially when you have no damn microphone. I mean, I'm working harder on this one that I have on all six that I did today. This is the hardest one because I have a microphone that was obviously meant for congressmen and senators, not for a president. So it's a little bit off, but that's okay. You know, you have to learn how to isn't that funny when he put it back in here and handed it to me. But that's the way we started. I thought that was better. Nobody got that. Only this front row got that one. I thought that was very clever, actually. But then he came up to me. The doctor, Sean. He said, sir, I'm sorry to inform you that your son Baron has tested positive again. I said brilliantly for what he said for Covert. I said, Oh, that's terrible. Oh, no, he'll be okay, sir. He'll be okay. I said, It's terrible, but he's young and he's strong, and he's very tall. Have you ever seen I say hi? Barry, 14 years old. He's very tall. He's definitely tall, and he's strong. But he's young. And I said, That's terribly said, no, he'll be okay, so he'll be okay. And I said, Well, I hope, like, 12 minutes later, I say, How's Baron doing, Doctor? Sir, he's 100%. Now. He's get your kids back to school. Okay? Right. Get him back to school. All right, so we're gonna mess, distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks. It's gonna be coming out very soon, and we will quickly eradicate the virus, wipe out the China plague once and for all. Get it the hell out of here. We will never forget either. We will not forget. That was not good. You know, we made a great trade deal with China, is you know very well, but you know, the ink wasn't dry before we got this. And no good no good. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state. Locking you in your home while you're you're far left. Anarchists are allowed to roam the streets, burned down your cities, hit people over the head. They're allowed to do that. That's why I always call all of these rallies. Protests these air not rallies anymore. Because you're allowed to have a protest. You can't have a rally and you can't go to church. You know you're not allowed to go to church, but you're allowed Thio burn down the cities with the protest. So we always call these friendly protests. The Biden lock down will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, no Easter, no Fourth of July and no future. Other than that, it's really not a bad way to go. A vote for Sleepy Joe Biden is a vote for lockdowns, layoffs, misery and no fracking. How about the guy? No fracking. For over a year and a half, there will be no fracking. He goes to Pennsylvania Absolutely Well, Frank. Okay. And these guys don't do anything about it. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus. A job to support your family and freedom to live your life. Then you have no choice but to cast your ballot for a gentleman named Donald J Trump. And as I said, And you have to remember this, you know, because during the debate, the debate was good. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Very thanks. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. It's a great honor to be with you. I really did. During the Kenosha disaster. I really got to be friendly with a lot of people up here long before that because we've had so many different people that we deal with. You have great people. We're gonna introduce you a few of them. But you have great people here. But I really got to know you're doing that problem. That potential crisis that we put out very, very swiftly once we got called and it's great, you're great people. You built the country. You're great people. Joe Biden. And as I said, he ran the, uh, h one n when he called it n one h when he couldn't get it right. He still does. He can't get it right I said, Joe H comes before and it's easy to remember H one n one swine flu. And he failed horribly. And he was a laughing stock all over Washington. As you remember and his chief of staff. I don't know why this guy said it, but he made the worst statements. He said, This guy, we have no idea what we're doing now. All of a sudden he's coming. And he said he was the one that said I shouldn't close it down. China heavily infected China, right? You remember that mess anyway? Then now he runs, He said I should have closed it sooner. It Zraly disgraceful. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, a respected man. He said Biden has been wrong or nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four years. Right? Four years, he said. He's always wrong, and he has been always wrong. I don't believe he's even running. I can't believe the whole thing I've watched. I watched the debates. You had 27 total killers on the stage and he was there and but you don't have to believe me because it's you and because it's Wisconsin, we spent a fortune and hopefully that will work better than the microphone. Try it. Put it off. Joe Budden. Joe Budden The oh, How do you take it? This was today. You forgot the show. I haven't taken the test. Why the hell would I take a test? Come on, man. That's like saying you before you got in this program, you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not. What do you think, Huh? Are you a Jodi's? By the way? This my little sister Valerie. And I'm Jill's husband. Oh, no. You switched on me. This is my sister. They switched on me. E tell it if you have a problem figuring out whether you're familiar, Trump and you ain't black, there is not a single solitary reason in the world. Why? Why? As I said, we shouldn't be in a position that everybody. And that's my wife, Jill. Hey, Julie. I'm Jill's husband, actually. And corn Pop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys. And I did you back in those days and shot Things have changed. Play the radio, make sure the television. Excuse me. Make sure you have the record player on that night. The phone. Make sure the kids hear words way all these truths to be self evident. All men and women created by go. You know that you know the thing? Because if you could take it, you were a quartermaster.

He gonna find ourselves in a position where if Trump gets elected, we're gonna be We're gonna be in a different world after after lie after lie. You know, we have to come together. That's why I'm running. I'm running is a proud Democrat for the Senate. And by the way, you know, I sit on the stand and it gets hot. I got a lot of I got hairy legs that turned that that that that that that turned, uh, blonde in the sun and the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg down. So it was trading. Then watch the hair come back up again. They look at so I learned about Roaches. I learned about kids jumping on my lap. And I've loved kids jumping on my life rock. And I think it's a right for people have bad kept care. We have to do at least several things. One, we have Thio depend on what the president is going to do right now. And first of all, he has thio tell, uh, wait till the cases before anything happens. Look, exacerbating the need for environmental firms up environmental justice. Sorry. As a bug, we got a lot of work to do. I don't need you to get me elected the case. We cannot let this. We've never allowed any crisis from the Civil War straight through to the pandemic of 17 all the way around 16 we have never, never let our democracy six second fiddle way that we can both have a democracy on elections and at the same time correct the public health everywhere. I've been hearing all around the country. You're trying your breast, but it never feels like enough. It's And here comes the train that he tried to make sure didn't continue to up front. No, that's the commuter. Alright? No, that's what But folks look anyway, I am I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical mental fill my physical as well as my mental fitness. I'll lead an effective strategy to mobilize true international effort to pressure shoes. Who? Yeah, thank you. What a good job. Thank you. Thank you very much. It was just a small little sampling. We have many more. Somewhere too rough to put on. We just decided. But that said Look, this is not what our country needs. This isn't. This isn't about Yeah, It is about me. I guess when you think about but But this is not what our country can have. We can have this one thing. I'll tell you.

He wasn't sharp. 25 years ago and now it's not. You can't let this happen to our country. That's all I can say, because it's not a game. We're not playing a game, you know, we have a good time tonight. We love each other, having fun. But when you get right there, it's not about fun. We can't let this happen to our country.

And we're really you know, we didn't need this. We had a wonderful super. It was just going good. Then I said, You know, maybe I'll give it a shot. You know why? Because of trade, it started because of trade. I hated. I watched. It was so obvious the way we were being ripped off on trade. And I said, Let's give it a world. And I said to my wife, I'd like to do it. What do you think she said? Well, you have to really want it because you know you will win, don't you? I said, Do you think so? Really? She had more. She had a little more security in the fact that if I ran no, she said, You will win if you but you have to make sure you want it. I said I want to do it because we have so many things we could do I never thought we would have done what we've done, though we've done Ah lot together together. We've done so much. You think about all It probably started more. I talked to Ron about it. Probably started with trade because I hated our companies were leaving to Mexico, Canada, China. They were all leaving our country. We have these stupid laws and horrible tax deals where they had incentives to move to Mexico, they got incentivized to move to Mexico. Somebody had a concept G. Let's make Mexico great again. You know, I said No, I want to make our country great again. So that's the story. It's a complicated story, but it all evolved into this evening and tomorrow we have our big day, and tomorrow I think that I think it's gonna be a really special day, and I hope you can all go out. You'll find the time and go out and vote, and we're gonna make you very proud. You're gonna make your gonna be made really very proud. I just finishing off. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we're finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs and our factories and our troops. Finally. Finally, finally, we're bringing them back home to the Yusa, where they belong. For 47 years, Joe Biden viciously attacked black Americans. He called young Black men super predators all the time. To every black American. I am asking you to go out tomorrow and votes very important. This is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to jail you and to betray you. I'm fighting for you, and we got criminal justice reform completed prison reform, completed opportunity zones completed with a great Tim Scott of South Carolina and funding for historically black colleges and universities. We got that done and I say all the time, and sometimes people say that's a big statement. Then they realize it's true with the exception of Abraham Lincoln. There's never been a president that has done so much for the black community, and it's my honor. It's my honor. It is my honor and under my leadership, and by the way, I don't know if you've been watching what's going on in Florida. We're doing really well and you know what they're talking about. The black community on the Hispanic American community is really they're like in Trump. What's going on now? We're doing very well. Florida Florida is doing very well. So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It's already begun. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God's help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech on the right to keep and bear arms, your Second Amendment, which is totally under siege. But as long as Ron Johnson and your great congressmen are there, we will protect it, right? Land, everybody, we will protect it, Ron, that's an easy one for us, but it wouldn't be easy. If he got it. We wouldn't have enough to say about it. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise Medical building Require price Transparency starts on January 1st and it will be bigger than healthcare, lower drug prices, even Mawr favorite nations. The drug companies do not like me too much. I will tell you will have the lowest drug prices anywhere in the world. And we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. America will land. The first woman on the moon in the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and we will restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our Children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag on We will live by the timeless words of our national motto. In God we trust. For years you had a president who apologize to America. We had a sister. I mean, we have had I watched Obama go out and apologize all over the world. He would apologize all over the world. He apologize for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great great people of Wisconsin. Tomorrow you have the power. You have the vote. You have the power. Really? To save America, we can't go down that path. We will never be a socialist country. We will never be a so get your friends.

Green Bay to right here in Kenosha, we inherit the legacy of American Patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settle the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. On the best is yet to come. I proud citizens like you helped build this country on together. We are taking back our country.

         "Well, thank you all for being here today. To Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller, to the Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett, to General John Hyten, General Jay Raymond, General James Dickinson, General David Thompson, and General David Allvin: On behalf of the First Family, welcome to the White House. And welcome to the first anniversary of that branch of our Armed Forces that will ensure for generations that America remains as dominant in space as we are on land and sea and air. Welcome to the first anniversary of the United States Space Force. (Applause.) Many kind things have been said about your Vice President, but I have to tell you I am the second-biggest champion of the Space Force in this administration. So as we begin, allow me to bring greetings and first anniversary congratulations from a champion of everyone who wears the uniform of the United States and the founder of the United States Space Force. I bring greetings and congratulations from the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) We just left the Oval Office with the President. And from the very first moment that he conceived of the idea of creating a new branch of our Armed Forces dedicated to our security in space, he has been an enthusiast, and I can testify , as the Acting Secretary and the Secretary of the Air Force can attest , that enthusiasm has only grown in the last year. And he's proud of each and every one of you, as I am. But we're grateful to the contributions of all of you in this room, and to the speakers who have preceded me at this podium, for bringing us to the fruition of this first year, but, more importantly, bringing us to this day, a year ago Sunday, that saw the creation of the first new branch of our Armed Forces in more than 70 years. And there are members of Congress who are with us today who I remember in those critical moments in the legislative process who were absolutely indispensable. And I'd like you to join me in thanking Congressman Doug Lamborn for your great leadership on behalf of our Space Force. (Applause.) And the first person ever to mention to me that we ought to restart the National Space Council. Even before I had this job, he was one of the greatest champions of American leadership in space and the Congress of the United States: Congressman Brian Babin. Thank you. (Applause.) And I want to give particular note to a member of the United States Senate who, in the late going, was there fighting to ensure that we would establish a new branch of our Armed Forces that would have a foundation of independence to be able to grow for generations and serve the security of our nation. So join me in thanking Senator Kevin Cramer for your outstanding and seminal leadership. (Applause.) I also want to take a moment to express my appreciation to two members of Congress who are not here but who have been and remain champions and emblematic of the bipartisan support that this new branch of our Armed Forces enjoys across the Congress of the United States. Join me in thanking Congressman Adam Smith, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and the incoming ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman Mike Rogers , two leaders who have championed the United States Space Force. (Applause.) And it's my greatest honor to be here with so many warriors who have stood in the gap for America and to be able to thank you for your service, and to thank you for the foundation that you've helped pour for future generations of Americans in our security in space. There are several people to thank, but I , there's a man who I consider to be a giant in the realm of American leadership in space. He's a former commander of the Air Force Space Command. I first , I first met him at Offutt Air Force Base, when he was leading our Strategic Command forces there. He actually comes from a family that's been involved in American space enterprise throughout his life. And at just the right time, he became Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Would you join me in thanking General John Hyten and his wonderful wife Laura? (Applause.) I know the President knows is what I know , is we wouldn't be here without you, General. So thank you so very much for your strong leadership. But to all the members of our Armed Forces with us here today: Thank you for your service to our great nation. And thank you for your enthusiastic participation in this first year of the launch of the United States Space Force. You know, yesterday marked the birthday of flight. History records that it was 117 years ago that two sons of a Heartland preacher , one of whom was born in Indiana , (laughter) , did what for all of history had seemed impossible when they took their first flight to the skies over Kitty Hawk. But in just a few short days, on Sunday, December the 20th, we will mark the formal anniversary of another American breakthrough. On Sunday, it will be one year since President Donald Trump signed into law the first new branch of our Armed Forces in more than 70 years. That historic moment was a culmination of an effort that began from the early days of this administration , from almost the first moment that the President and I spoke about space when we were campaigning for these jobs. He had a dual focus of renewing American leadership in human space exploration, but also ensuring that America remained as dominant in space as we are in land and air and sea. And from the first day of this administration, President Trump called for steps to renew American leadership in space. It would be in June of 2018, the President first laid out a vision that called for the creation of a new military service focused solely on threats in and from space. The idea, though, and its conception was not a new one. For more than 50 years, Presidents and military leaders had discussed a branch of our military dedicated to ensuring American national security in and from space, but time and again, those efforts faltered. But I would submit to you that it is a tribute to the leadership of our Commander-in-Chief, a tribute to the extraordinary military leadership gathered here today that this time, with bipartisan support, in just one and a half years, the United States Space Force was born. (Applause.) And since that historic moment, the United States Space Force has only grown stronger by the day. And that means that America has grown more secure by the day. After the Space Force became law, the President's first decision was who would lead it. And the President and I get the sense in the room, there is broad agreement that he got that decision right too. He chose a man , (applause) , He chose a man who , you've heard from these podiums already , is considered to be the Hap Arnold of our time. He would become the Chief of Space Operations of the United States Space Force. And I can tell you, having witnessed his leadership firsthand, that when General Jay Raymond stepped forward, it brought the leadership, the energy, the vision, the professionalism, and the patriotism necessary to have this historic year for the United States Space Force. So join me in thanking General Jay Raymond, his wonderful wife Mollie, and his proud son Gary for all of their commitment to America. (Applause.) Thank you, General. Good job. It's amazing to think that this spring General Raymond actually welcomed the first enlisted member to the Space Force. So how about a round of applause for Chief Master Sergeant Roger Towberman? (Applause.) You can stand up. Come on, stand up. Thank you. Thank you, Chief. In April, those two men were literally the entire United States Space Force. (Laughter.) But in just eight months, we already have more than 2,000 military members , space professionals in the United States Space Force. And I'm told that an additional 3,600 officers and enlisted airmen have already started to fill out the paperwork to transfer into the Space Force. (Applause.) In fact, General Raymond tells us that we anticipate, on our current trajectory, the Space Force will have nearly 6,000 space professionals serving all across the globe in just a short period of time. In fact, today, the Space Force got its newest and perhaps most famous member , a man who is actually in space right now, at the International Space Station. General Raymond took care of the paperwork, and I think it might actually be the first in-orbit transfer in military history. Colonel Michael Hopkins, NASA astronaut and member of the United States Space Force. (Applause.) Great move. You know, heroes like him and like all of you are going to inspire generations of Americans. In fact, Secretary Barbara Barrett and I witnessed some of those young Americans stepping forward in Colorado Springs, where we both had the opportunity to address the 62nd Graduation of the United States Air Force Academy. When I was there, they told me, in a typical year, about 20 cadets choose to go into space operations. This year, I was there when 86 cadets stood up and took the oath as officers in the United States Space Force. (Applause.) And just to continue to build on the momentum, I'm proud to report to the senator and these members of Congress and all those looking on that it was my honor , with Secretary Barrett at my side and General Raymond, as well , that we made it official. We traveled to Florida to announce the first two Space Force installations in American history: Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and Patrick Space Force Base. (Applause.) And the Space Force is growing stronger every day and just in the nick of time. I think every one of the military leaders here knows that space is a vacuum, but we're not operating in a vacuum. The space race began in the 1950s, and it continues today. And in President Donald Trump, we have a Commander-in-Chief who has understood clearly that space is a warfighting domain and it's imperative that we invest the resources and the personnel and the technology to defend our nation and defend our values in the outer reaches of space. In fact, the United States, as you've heard already, faces emerging threats in space for countries like China and Russia, and those threats are only growing. We were reminded of that just this week, when Russia conducted yet another anti-satellite missile launch. We're leading in space, but our determination under this President and with his extraordinary military leadership, is to stay in the lead to defend America and defend our freedom from space. (Applause.) We seek peace through strength. And I want to say to the men and women of the United States Space Force: When it comes to the outer reaches of space, you are that strength. So today, we celebrate leadership from our President, the great bipartisan support in the Congress, and the military leadership that has seen to both the birth and the pouring of the first year's foundation of the United States Space Force. And I just came here today to thank each and every one of you, but also to make another announcement. As I mentioned, we just returned from the Oval Office. And so it is my honor, on behalf of the President of the United States, to announce that, henceforth, the men and women of the United States Space Force will be known as 'Guardians.' (Applause.) Soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Guardians will be defending our nation for generations to come. (Applause.) So, with that announcement, let me just say thank you again. I want to thank the members of Congress who are with us today. Thank you for the honor of your presence, but more importantly, thank you , thank you for your leadership in bringing us to this moment one year ago and the support that you've continued to provide to see to the launch of this new branch of our Armed Forces. But on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, let me urge each and every one of you Guardians to keep pushing. Keep pushing. Keep pushing the vision and the mission of the United States Space Force, which is to ensure that America remains as dominant in space, and from space, as we are on land and sea and air. And to each one of you Guardians, let me just say: Each and every day, from this day forward, I want to assure you that you will serve with the confidence of your Commander-in-Chief. You will serve with the confidence and gratitude of the American people. And I'm also convinced that those of you that will serve in the United States Space Force, in this generation and generations to come, will also go with the prayers of millions of Americans who will claim that ancient verse that promises that: If you rise on the wings of the dawn, if you settle on the far side of the sea, even if you go up to the heavens, that there His hand will guide you and his right hand will hold you fast. That then will be our prayer for our Guardians in this generation and for generations to come. So Happy Birthday to the United States Space Force. God bless our Guardians. God bless all the members of our Armed Forces. And God bless America. Semper Supra. (Applause.)",

         "Once again , the words 'I can't breathe.' An act of brutality so elemental, it did more than deny one more black man in America his civil rights and his human rights. It denied his very humanity. It denied him of his life. Depriving George Floyd , as it deprived Eric Garner , of the one thing every human being must be able to do: Breathe. So simple. So basic. So brutal. The same thing happened with Ahmaud Arbery. The same with Breonna Taylor. The same thing with George Floyd. We've spoken their names aloud. Cried them out in pain and horror. Chiseled them into long suffering hearts. They are the latest additions to an endless list of lives stolen , potential wiped out unnecessarily. It's a list that dates back more than 400 years: black men, black women, black children. The original sin of this country still stains our nation today. Sometimes we manage to overlook it, and just push forward with the thousand other tasks of daily life. But it's always there. And weeks like this, we see it plainly. We are a country with an open wound. None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words , 'I can't breathe' , and do nothing. We cannot fall victim to what Martin Luther King called the 'appalling silence of the good people.' Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering , who will be next? Imagine if every time your husband or son, wife or daughter, left the house, you feared for their safety from bad actors and bad police. Imagine if you had to have that talk with your child about not asserting their rights , and taking the abuse handed out to them , just so they could make it home. Imagine having the police called on you , for just sitting in Starbucks or renting an Airbnb or watching birds. That is the norm for black people in this nation , they don't have to imagine it. The anger and the frustration and the exhaustion , it's undeniable. But that is not the promise of America. And it is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all people. This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism. It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation. We need justice for George Floyd. We need real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet , that holds bad cops accountable, and that repairs the relationship between law enforcement and the community they are sworn to protect. And we need to stand up as a nation , with the black community, and with all minority communities , and come together as one America. That's the challenge we face. And it will require those of us who sit in positions of influence to finally deal with the abuse of power. The pain is too immense for one community to bear alone. It is the duty of every American to grapple with it , and grapple with it now. With our complacency, our silence , we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence. Nothing about this will be easy or comfortable. But if we simply allow this wound to scab over once more, without treating the underlying injury , we will never truly heal. The very soul of America is at stake. We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. We have to pursue it with real urgency. We have to make real the American promise, which we have never fully grasped: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives.",

         "Well, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Wow. (Applause.) Well, thank you very much, everybody. Wow. We've all been through a lot together, and we probably deserve that hand for all of us, because it's been a very unfair situation. I invited some of our very good friends. And we have limited room, but everybody wanted to come. We kept it down to a minimum. And believe it or not, this is a minimum. But a tremendous thing was done over the last number of months, but really, if you go back to it, over the last number of years. We had the witch hunt. It started from the day we came down the elevator, myself and our future First Lady, who's with us right now. Thank you, Melania. (Applause.) And it never really stopped. We've been going through this now for over three years. It was evil. It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars. And this should never, ever happen to another President ever. I don't know that other Presidents would have been able to take it. Some people said, no, they wouldn't have. But I can tell you, at a minimum, you have to focus on this because it can get away very quickly. No matter who you have with you, it can get away very quickly. It was a disgrace. Had I not fired James Comey , who was a disaster, by the way , it's possible I wouldn't even be standing here right now. We caught him in the act. Dirty cops. Bad people. If this happened to President Obama, a lot of people would have been in jail for a long time already. Many, many years. I want to start by thanking some of , and I call them friends, because, you know, you develop friendships and relationships when you're in battle and war, much more so than, 'Gee, let's have a normal situation.' With all that we've gone through, we've done, I think, more than any President and administration, and really, I say, for the most part, Republican congressmen, congresswomen, and Republican senators. We've done more than any administration in the first few years, if you look at all of the things we've done. I watched this morning as they tried to take credit for the stock market from , (laughter) , from , think of that. Let me tell you, if we didn't win, the stock market would have crashed. And the market was going up a lot before the election because it was looking we had a good chance to win, and then it went up tremendously from the time we won the election until the time we took office, which was November 8th to January 20th. And that's our credit. That's all our credit. And leading up to that point was our credit because there was hope. And one of the reasons the stock market has gone up so much in the last few days is people think we're doing so well. They liked the State of the Union speech. (Applause.) It really is , it's a true honor to give it. Making the State of the Union speech, I was with some people that have been around; they've been all over the world. And one of them, a highly sophisticated person, said, 'You know, no matter where you go in the world, it doesn't make any difference , there is nothing like what I witnessed tonight.' The beauty, the majesty of the Chamber. The power of the United States, the power of the people in this room. Really, an amazing , I don't think there is anything like that anywhere in the world. You can go to any other country, you can go to any other location, any other place. It's the beauty of everything. It's what it represents and how it represents our country. I want to start by introducing some of the people that are here. I know some are going to be left out. But they work so hard. And this is really not a news conference. It's not a speech. It's not anything. It's just we're sort of , it's a celebration, because we have something that just worked out. I mean, it worked out. We went through hell, unfairly. Did nothing wrong. Did nothing wrong. I've done things wrong in my life, I will admit. (Laughter.) Not purposely, but I've done things wrong. But this is what the end result is. (Applause.) (The President holds up the front cover of The Washington Post newspaper.) We can take that home, Honey. Maybe we'll frame it. (Laughter.) It's the only good headline I've ever had in the Washington Post, I'll tell you. (Laughter.) But every paper is the same. Does anybody have those papers? Does anybody have them? Because they're really like that. So I appreciate that. But some of the people here have been incredible warriors. They're warriors. And there's nothing, from a legal standpoint , this is a political thing. And every time, I'd say, 'This is unfair. Let's go to court.' They'd say, 'Sir, you can't go to court. This is politics.' And we were treated unbelievably unfairly. And you have to understand, we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bullshit. (Laughter.) We then went through the Mueller report. And they should have come back one day later. They didn't. They came back two years later, after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money. People came to Washington to help other people. 'Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,' I say. They came , one or two or three people in particular, but many people. We had a rough campaign. It was nasty. It was one of the nastiest, they say. They say Andrew Jackson was always the nastiest campaign. They actually said we topped it. (Laughter.) It was a nasty , it was a nasty , both in the primaries and in the , in the election. But, you see, we thought, after the election, it would stop. But it didn't stop; it just started. And tremendous corruption. Tremendous corruption. So we had a campaign. Little did we know we were running against some very, very bad and evil people with fake dossiers, with all of these horrible, dirty cops that took these dossiers and did bad things. They knew all about it. The FISA courts should be ashamed of themselves. It's a very tough thing. And then we ended up winning on Russia, Russia, Russia. It should have taken the one day, as I said, and it took years. Then Bob Mueller testified. That didn't work out so well for the other side. (Laughter.) But they should have said, that first week , because it came out. Is that right, Jim Jordan? They knew in the first two days actually. Devin, is that right? Two days. They knew that we were totally innocent. But they kept it going, Mark. They kept it going forever because they wanted to inflict political pain on somebody that had just won an election that, to , a lot of people were surprised. I mean, we had polls that said we were going to win. We had Los Angeles Times and a few , a few papers, actually, said it was , we were going to win but it was going to be close. And we did win. It was one of the greatest wins of all time. And they said, 'Okay, he won.' And, you know, I wrote this down because that was where a thing called the 'insurance policy' , to me, when I saw the insurance policy , and that was done long before the election. That was done when they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win. And, by the way, Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for millions , millions of dollars , the fake dossier. And now Christopher Steele admits that it's a fake because he got sued by rich people. I should have sued him too. But when you're President, people don't like suing. I want to thank my legal team, by the way , not for that advice, but for other advice. (Applause.) Pat, Jay. Pat. You guys stand up, please. (Applause.) Great job. (Applause.) Right at the beginning, they said, 'Sir, you have nothing to worry about. All of the facts are on your side.' I said, 'You don't understand. That doesn't matter. That doesn't matter.' And that was really true. They made up facts. A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president. He brought it out of thin air. Just made it up. They say he's a screenwriter , a failed screenwriter. He tried to go into , unfortunately, he went into politics after that. (Laughter.) Remember he said the statement, which is a mob statement: 'Don't call me. I'll call you.' I didn't say that. Fortunately, for all of us here today and for our country, we had transcripts. We had transcribers , professional transcribers. Then they said, 'Oh, well, maybe the transcription is not correct.' But Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother , right? , we had some people that , really amazing. But we did everything. We said, 'What's wrong with it?' 'Well, they didn't add this word or that one.' It didn't matter. I said, 'Add it. They're probably wrong, but add it.' So now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate. When you read those transcripts, Tim Scott , I don't know if Tim is here, but he said, 'Sir ' He was the first one to call me. 'Sir, I read the transcript. You did nothing wrong.' And, Mitch, he stayed there, right from the beginning. He never changed. And, Mitch McConnell, I want to tell you: You did a fantastic job. (Applause.) Somebody said, 'You know, Mitch is quiet.' I said, 'He's not quiet. He's not quiet.' These are the , he doesn't want people to know him. And they said, 'Is Mitch smart?' I said, 'Well, let's put it this way: For many, many years, a lot of very smart , bad, in many cases, sometimes good , but people have been trying to take his place. And to the best of my knowledge, I've never even heard the subject come up, because they've been wiped out so fast. (Laughter.) This guy is great, and I appreciate it, Mitch. (Applause.) And he's also given us 191 now. (Applause.) A hundred and ninety-one federal judges. Two Supreme Court judges, right? It's up to 191. (Applause.) True. Great guy. Great guy. He's a tough guy to read. I'm good at reading people. A tough guy to read. I'd call him. My wife would say, 'How did you do with Mitch?' 'Uhh, I don't know.' (Laughter.) That's what makes him good , when you can read somebody. Fantastic job. And he understood, rightfully, that this was crooked politics. This was crooked politics. How about all these people, they're running for office. They're saying the worst things about me, like eight senators on the Democrat side. Most of them got wiped out. You know, they got their 1 percent or less. Most of them got less. They decided to go home. 'Let's go back to California.' Let's go back to wherever they came from. 'Let's go back to New York.' How about that one? Our New York senator, Gillibrand. 'Let's go back to New York,' after they get nothing. And then they take an oath that they will be fair, that they will be reason- , and all of the different things. And they had to sign. They're not fair. But here's the beauty: So we have four left. They're saying the most horrendous things about me. It's okay, it's politics. And then they're supposed to vote , on me. They're trying to replace me, and then they're supposed to be voting. So I think it's , I mean, I think it's incredible. But , so, Mitch, I want to thank you very much. Incredible. And you have some of your folks here, and they're incredible people , and they've been, right from the beginning. And, again, you're out of session. Unfortunately, I didn't , you know, I only told these folks, 'Let's do this today.' We did a prayer breakfast this morning, and I thought that was really good. In fact, that was so good it might wipe this out. But by the end , by the time we finished this, we'll wipe that one out , those statements. (Laughter.) I had , I had Nancy Pelosi sitting four seats away, and I'm saying things that a lot of people wouldn't have said , (laughter) , but I meant every , (laughter) , I meant every word of it. But we have some of the folks that are going to be leaving right after this, and they work hard , and they did work hard. Bill Cassidy, Senator. Stand up, Bill. What a guy. (Applause.) Great man. When I need to know about health insurance and preexisting conditions and individual mandates, I call Bill or I call Barrasso. We get those two guys; they know more than anybody. A man who just became a senator , he's a little bit like me; we have a couple of them. A very successful guy in business, and he said, 'What the hell, I'll run for the Senate' , from Indiana. And he ran. And I saw him on television, destroying his opponent in a debate. I said, 'You know, this guy could win.' And I got behind him. And, Mike Braun, you have done some great job. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Tough. Tough. Thank you. A man who got James Comey to choke, and he was just talking in his regular voice. He is the roughest man. He's actually an unbelievable , and I appreciate the letter you sent me today. I just got it. But he's got this voice that scares people. (Laughter.) You know, people from Iowa can be very tough. We're doing very well in Iowa. But I'll tell you, Chuck Grassley , he's looking at Comey: 'Well, you tell me, what did you say?' (Laughter.) Now, he wasn't being rough. That was just the way he talked. (Laughter.) And that was when Comey , I think that was when Comey announced that he was leaking, lying, and everything else, right? He choked because he never heard anybody talk like that. (Laughter.) You know, you should have gone , I wish you got angry. You could have gotten the whole ballgame. He would have said, 'I give up.' (Laughter.) Chuck Grassley is an incredible guy. (Applause.) And a man who , you know, he was running against a tough, smart campaign and we learned how good she was, right? She was a great campaigner. In fact, by the end of the campaign, she was actually , I thought she was more for me than you were, Josh. I was worried. (Laughter.) I saw her ad; she was saying the greatest things about me. And you know who I'm talking about. And I went to a great place , Missouri , and I said, 'Who do you have to beat her?' And they said, 'Well, we have four people.' I said, 'Let me see them. I'm got to interview ' , can you imagine? I'm interviewing people for the United States Senate. This is what I do. Where have I gone? But I love it. I love it because we're getting great people. The first one I met was Josh Hawley. After about 10 minutes, I said to the people, 'Don't show me anybody else. This is the guy.' He was the attorney general. Did a phenomenal job in the state. Highly respected. And , Claire McCaskill. So, the theory was you couldn't beat her. Great campaigner. Remember the last campaign, she was going to be taken out. She was always going to be taken out, then she wins and people say, 'How did that happen?' Didn't happen with him. But she got so friendly toward me. In fact, one of the ads I still have. I'm putting it in the archives as one of the best ads I've ever made. (Laughter.) And she tried to convince people that we were best friends. But Josh ended up winning by five or six points. You were unbelievable. You were tough. And you are something. And one of the greatest supporters on the impeachment hoax was Josh Hawley. He was incensed actually; I watched it. He was incensed at what they were doing and what they were saying. And those were the ones , you know, I had some that said, 'Oh, I wish you didn't make the call.' And that's okay, if they need that. It's incorrect. It's totally incorrect. And then you have some that used religion as a crutch. They never used it before. An article written today: 'Never heard him use it before.' But today, you know, it's one of those things. But, you know, it's a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for President. But, Josh Hawley, I want to thank you. You were right from the beginning. Man, did I make a good choice. (Applause.) Thank you, Josh. Tremendous future. A man who is brilliant and who actually was deceived, to an extent, comes from a great state, Utah, where my poll numbers have gone through the roof. And one of the senators' poll numbers, and not this one, went down big. You saw that. You saw that, Mike? But Mike Lee is a brilliant guy. He's difficult. (Laughter.) Whenever I sign bills , you know, we do sign a lot of legislation that's , it's big and it's powerful, but it's sort of everybody has to approve it. And I see 99 to 1 , (laughter) , 99 to 1. I say, 'Don't tell me who's the one.' (Laughter.) 'Is it Mike?' 'Yes.' (Laughter.) And he always has a good reason for it too, by the way. But he is , he's incredible. And right at the beginning, he knew we were right, Mike, and I appreciate it very much. You're just fantastic. And say hello to the people of Utah and tell them, 'I'm sorry about Mitt Romney. I'm sorry.' (Laughter and applause.) Okay? We can say that Mike Lee is, by far, the most popular senator from the state. But you've done a fantastic job, Mike, in many ways. In many ways. A young woman who I didn't know at all, but she's been so supportive , and I've had great support from other people in that state. And she's been so supportive, and she's been downright nasty and mean about the unfairness to the President. And Kelly Loeffler, I appreciate very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Great. She saw it very early on, and we have , I don't know if we have other senators here, but we got a hell of a lot of congressmen. And I'll go over them quickly, but they have , they have also been , you know, it helped when we won 197 to nothing. That's got to be a first, Kevin. Right? Is that, like, a first? The Republicans have this image. See, I say Democrats are lousy politicians because they have lousy policy: open borders, sanctuary cities. They have horrible policy. Who the hell can win? Oh, their new policy is: Raise taxes. They want to raise taxes. You know, all my life, I wasn't in politics, but I'd say, if you're a politician, you want to say, 'We're going to lower taxes.' They want to raise taxes. So they have open borders, sanctuary cities. 'Raise everybody's taxes. Get rid of everybody's healthcare.' A hundred and eighty million people in the United States. And they're really happy. 'And we're going to give you a healthcare that's going to cost more money than the country could make in 30 years if it really does well.' That's one year. So I've always said they're lousy politicians, but they do two things: They are vicious and mean. Vicious. These people are vicious. Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. And she wanted to impeach a long time ago. When she said, 'I pray for the President. I pray for the ' , she doesn't pray. She may pray, but she prays for the opposite. (Laughter.) But I doubt she prays at all. And these are vicious people, but they do two things: They stick together, historically. I'm not talking now. They stick together like glue. That's how they impeached, because they had whatever the number is , 220 people. So if they don't lose anybody, they'll be able to impeach anybody. You could be George Washington. You could have just won the war, and they say, 'Let's get him out of office.' And they stuck together, and they're vicious as hell. And they'll probably come back for more, but maybe not because the Republican Party's poll numbers, Mitch, have now gone up more than any time, I think, since 2004, 2005, and you know what happened then. But in normal times , decades, you would call it; that was a little unusual time; it was for a very short period , the Republicans Party , Party's poll numbers and Donald Trump's poll numbers are the highest I've ever had them. So maybe they were. It's no way to get your poll numbers up. It's not worth it , because from my family's standpoint, it's been very unfair for my family. It's been very unfair to the country. Think of it. A phone call. A very good phone call. I know bad phone calls. This is a phone call with many people. I think Mike Pompeo was probably on the call. Where is Mike? Mike Pompeo was on the call. Many people were on the call. I know there were many people. They even have 'apprenti,' bringing up an old favorite word of mine. 'The Apprentice.' They have 'apprenti.' They have people on these calls. And I know there are many. When I speak to the head of a nation , and they have many people on. I mean, also on , do you think they just , in the case of Ukraine, he's a new president, seems like a very nice person, by the way. His whole thing was corruption. He's going to stop corruption. We even have a treaty , 2001, 1999. It's a treaty , signed treaty , that we will work together to root out corruption in Ukraine. I probably have a legal obligation, Mr. Attorney, to report corruption. But they don't think it's corrupt when a son that made no money, that got thrown out of the military, that had no money at all, is working for $3 million up front, $83,000 a month. And that's only Ukraine. Then goes to China, picks up $1.5 billion. Then goes to Romania, I hear, and many other countries. They think that's okay? Because if it is , is Ivanka in the audience? Is Ivanka here? Boy, my kids could make a fortune. (Laughter.) They could make a fortune. It's corrupt. But it's not even that; it's just general corruption. And the other thing, as mentioned in the call and something that I've told Mike Pence, our great Vice President , I would tell him all the time, and I told him when he went on the trip, because he was over there. He never mentioned anything about this when you had your meeting. It's a terrible thing. But I told Mike. I said, 'Mike, we're giving them money, and, you know, you're always torn about that because we have our country to build, we have our cities to build and our roads to fix. But we're giving them money. Tell me, why isn't Germany paying money? Why isn't France? Why isn't United Kingdom paying money? Why aren't they paying money? Why are we paying them money?' Is that a correct statement, Mike? I say, 'Find out what the hell is going on.' And I told that to all of my people, OMB. I said , I asked that question: 'How much is Germany paying? Why isn't Germany paying?' Why is the United States always the sucker? Because we're a bunch of suckers. But that's turning around fast. But it makes it harder when stuff like this happens, because you want to focus, and you want to focus perfectly. Think what we could have done if the same energy was put into infrastructure, prescription drug prices. Think of what we could have done. And I'm now talking both sides. Think of what we could have done if we had the same genius , because it's genius. I will say, it's genius on the other side , maybe even more so because they took nothing and brought me to a final vote of impeachment. That's a very ugly word to me. It's a very dark word. Very ugly. They took nothing. They took a phone call that was a totally appropriate call. I call it a 'perfect call' because it was. And they brought me to the final stages of impeachment. But now we have that gorgeous word , I never thought a word would sound so good. It's called 'total acquittal.' (Applause.) Total acquittal. So , so I want to, if I could, real fast, just introduce a few of the people. I have to start with , I have to start with Kevin. Man, did you do a job. Lucky you're there. Lucky you're there because it wouldn't have worked out. If you don't have the right people , I'll tell you, Kevin McCarthy has done an incredible job. (Applause.) Really. Stand up. And he loves this job, and he loves this country. I'll tell you what: Mitch and Kevin, they love what they do. Now, Mitch wouldn't even tell you he liked it. (Laughter.) I'd say, 'Mitch, do you like it?' 'I don't know.' (Laughter.) He's the greatest poker player, right? Kevin will say, 'I love it.' Right? And I will say that you're going to be Speaker of the House because of this impeachment hoax. (Applause.) I really believe it. I really believe it. And I'm going to work hard on it. I'm going to try and get out to those Trump , those Trump areas that we won by a lot. And, you know, in '18, we didn't win. We just won two seats in North Carolina , two wonderful seats in North Carolina that were not supposed to be won. But I went and I made speeches, and we had rallies, and we did a great job and we won. We took two seats. Nobody writes about that. If we lost them, it would have been the biggest story of the year. But we're going to go, we're going to do a job, and we're going to win a lot of seats. We're going to win a lot of seats. People are very angry that Nancy Pelosi and all of these guys , I mean, Nadler , I know him much of my life; he's fought me in New York for 25 years. I always beat him. And I had to beat him another time. And I'll probably have to beat him again. Because if they find that I happen to walk across the street, and maybe go against the light or something, 'Let's impeach him.' (Laughter.) So we'll probably have to do it again because these people have gone stone-cold crazy. But I've beaten them all my life, and I'll beat them again if I have to. (Applause.) But what they're doing is very unfair. Very unfair. So Kevin McCarthy has been great. So, a few names, right? And there'll be a few you forget. If you want, you can raise and I'll say, 'Great. Love to have you. Wonderful.' (Laughter.) But we're going to do the best we can. And I have my Cabinet, but my Cabinet is different , I appoint them. Okay? I didn't see all of them helping so much. (Laughter.) You know, they were running their various bureaucracies, right? (Laughter.) No, my Cabinet is great, and they're all here. But today is the day to celebrate these great warriors, right? These are great warriors. They really fought hard for us. And , So I'll start: Kelly Armstrong, North Dakota. Kelly, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) Great job. Jim Banks of Indiana. Jim, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) Andy Biggs. Where is Andy? Boy, oh, boy, Andy. He got , (applause) , there's a guy. He's tough. I hear we're doing well in Arizona, huh? It's going good, yeah? I think so. I think I saw a poll that was very good for me. I think we have to make sure Martha is going to do , I think Martha is going to do good. But we have some states that are going to be not easy, but Arizona has been great. And we're stopping illegal aliens from coming in. We're putting up walls. New Mexico, too, a state that's never been in play for Republicans, is totally in play. Right? Nevada is really looking good. We're doing well. We're doing well. We're going to have a great , there's more spirit. I will say this: There's more spirit now for the Republican Party, by far, than the Democrats. You know, Mike Pence just got back from a place , a beautiful place that Chuck Grassley knows well: Iowa. And he was talking about these fiasco , the Democrats, they can't count some simple votes, and yet they want to take over your healthcare system. Think of that. (Laughter.) No, think of it. But we also had an election out there, and we got 98 percent of the vote. We have two people running, you know, and I guess they consider them non-people, but they are running. I mean, one was a governor. One was a congressman. They're running. We got 98 percent of the vote. And everybody from the media was saying, 'Who are those crowds over there?' You know, they expect it to be one of these competitive , where everybody is running because they want to win, they want to win. And it was Trump. Right, Mark Meadows? It was Trump. This was a Trump crowd. And a lot of , actually, a lot of my guys went there. They went to Iowa. And a lot of friends went there, and we had tremendous , they say the spirit , the spirit for the Republican Party right now is stronger, I think, than it's ever been in the history of our country. I think it's stronger than it's ever been. (Applause.) And that includes Honest Abe Lincoln. You know, a lot of people forget Abe Lincoln. I wish he were here. I'd give him one hell of an introduction. Right? (Laughter.) But he was , he was a Republican. Abe Lincoln. Honest Abe. Bradley Byrne, Alabama. What a great place. (Applause.) Thank you, Bradley. A man who has been an unbelievable friend of mine and spokesman, and somebody that , that I really like. And I know, Kelly, you're going to end up liking him a lot. Something is going to happen that's going to be very good. I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet. But Doug Collins , where is he? Where is Doug? (Applause.) You have been so great. Thank you very much, Doug. Thank you very much. Thank you. Really amazing job. A young man who is , born with a great gene, because I know his father and how great a politician he was. But he's from Florida. Sometimes controversial, but actually, he's not controversial. He's solid as a rock and he's a friend of mine. Matt Gaetz. Matt? (Applause.) Thank you, Matt. Thank you. Great job. All right, this guy. So he's the NCAA , meaning, a couple of years ago, when he was in college , wrestling champion. NCAA. That's the big deal. That means, in all of college, you're the champ, you're the best. His record was ridiculous. Nobody would , nobody could beat him. And I see it. You know, every time, I see it. When I first got to know him , Jim Jordan , when I first got to know Jim, I said, 'Huh, he never wears a jacket. What the hell is going on?' (Laughter.) He's obviously very proud of his body. (Laughter and applause.) And they say where he works out , you know, where the congressmen, senators, they work out , they say, when Jim works out , even though he's not as young as he was, but he works out , the machine starts burning. You know, it's just a different form of a workout than us. Right, Sonny? And , there he is. Look at that guy. But one day I'm looking, and he looks tough. And I'm looking, and I'm looking at those ears. And I say, 'Those ears have something going on there.' I said, 'Did you ever wrestle?' 'Yeah, I did.' But he doesn't talk. But I checked. This guy was a world , this guy was a champion, top, top wrestler. And when I had the top , I had all of the teams. And, by the way, your Super Bowl champions are coming, I think next week or soon. Very soon. And every one of them want to be here. (Applause.) And the coach loves us. The coach is great. Andy Reid. And every one of them want to be here. We have , people love it. But we had all of the NCAA championship teams here. They had the golf, the basketball. They had every team here. And one of the teams was wrestling. The wrestling team. Was that Penn State? And Penn State won the title. They have a great team. And I walked up with Jim, and it's like I didn't exist. (Laughter.) Those wrestlers, they grabbed him. They love Jim Jordan, and we love you too because you are some warrior. (Applause.) True. True. A woman who became a star , we have a couple of women that became stars. You two. And I always liked the name of her , you know, I liked the name, 'Lesko.' I liked it. That's how I picked it. I liked the name. I saw that face. I saw that everything. They gave me cards. She had like seven opponents, right? And you have no idea how much the public appreciates how smart, how sharp you are. This I can't tell. I can't tell. They just said, 'You know, she's really good. She's really talented.' And I said, 'Let's go.' We worked with her. She won her race. Tough race. It's no longer tough. Because what she does out there is incredible. Arizona loves her. But you were so incredible, representing , I don't say 'me' , representing our country and getting it out of this impeachment hoax. What you did was incredible. So, Debbie, please stand up. Debbie Lesko. (Applause.) A man who I , I became very friendly with , I don't know why. Do you ever have where , I'll ask the media: If certain people call, you take their calls. Other people call , if they don't have information, they won't take anybody's call. But other people call, and you don't. This is a guy , he just , he's just a very special guy. His wife I actually like better than him, to be honest. (Laughter.) Because he doesn't know that I know that he didn't actually support me right from the beginning, but she did. (Laughter.) And on my worst day , right? , on my worst day, my worst , I won't tell you why it was my worst, but it was not one of those good days , she got on a bus, got many other buses and women all over North Carolina, and they toured North Carolina. Well, Mark was back sort of semi-supporting another candidate, which he ended up leaving very quickly. I don't think you had a choice, because of your wife, but thank her. And Mark Meadows, he's an extraordinary guy. I mean, the only problem is, I guess, he's announcing , he'd only win by 40 points, but he's announcing that he'll be not running this time. Do you have somebody good to run? Somebody going to win your district by at least 20 points, please? Okay? But he's a tremendously talented man, not just as a politician. As a human being, he's incredible. And during these horrible times , I mean, the way he worked and Jim and all of you guys , the way they worked so , it was like their life was at stake. So many. Ron DeSantis is another one. He worked so hard. Then he called me. He said, 'Sir, I'd like to run for governor.' I said, 'Governor? I don't want you to run. I like you staying.' 'No, I want to run for governor.' And I said, 'Well, if you have to.' 'I'd like your support.' I said, 'How can I support you? You're at three.' He was at three. He had no money. Somebody was at 38 and they had $22 million cash, right? I said, 'Look, if it's important, I'll do it,' because they , he's been another great warrior. And he's , by the way, he ran. I endorsed him. His numbers went through the roof. The man who we beat, who was expected to win easily, called me after the race. He said, 'You endorsed him, and it was like a nuclear bomb went off. There was nothing I could do.' He never even spent his money. He saved it. But Ron DeSantis is another one, and now he's the governor of Florida. And, by the way, he's a great governor. He's a very popular governor. His numbers are in the 70s. And he's done a great job. But, Mark, I want to thank you very much. Fantastic job. Thank you very much. Mark Meadows. (Applause.) And Mike Johnson of Louisiana. Where's Mike? Central casting. What a job. You can represent me anytime. (Applause.) You can represent me anytime. Thank you. What a job you've done. Thank you, Mike. And a man nobody has ever heard of, except the other side. He's the other side's worst nightmare. This guy goes down into dungeons and basements; he'll find a document, no matter what. He's the most legitimate human being. He's the hardest worker. He's unbelievable. He took tremendous abuse. I mean, abuse. The , the media and, you know, the other side, and the bad ones, the leakers, the liars, the dirty cops , they wanted to destroy him. They tried. They got close, but he wouldn't let it happen. And, honestly, in a certain way, he was the first one. Wouldn't you say, Jim and Mark and everybody? This was the first guy. He came out of nowhere. He's saying, 'These people are corrupt.' He's still saying it. And he was unbelievable. Devin Nunes. He was unbelievable. Unbelievable. (Applause.) That's so true, Devin. He'd come in and say , I didn't even know hi;, I just heard there were like , there was this congressman who kept going into a basement , into files. (Laughter.) He knew something was wrong. You felt it, right? And now we know a lot more than we knew then, right? You never thought it was as bad as it is. And hopefully we're going to take care of things, because we can never, ever allow this to happen again. (Applause.) Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. Scott, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Scott. Really great. And you're doing very well over there, by the way. Just saw your numbers.A man who is a , I mean, central casting. If I'm going to pick Perry Mason, I'm going to do a remake of Perry Mason , other than Bill Barr, I'd pick this guy. But I have to say, I'll pick Barr. I pick Barr first, right? (Laughter.) John Ratcliffe, right? But I have to tell you, if we're doing a remake of Perry Mason, the man I get , there's nobody in Hollywood like this , John Ratcliffe, right? (Applause.) Stand up, John. So , such a great lawyer. Incredible guy. Incredible talent. But just a great lawyer and we appreciate it. He gets on that screen, and everyone says, 'I agree.' The other side folds up so fast. We'll probably be using a lot of you in the next year. But you have been fantastic, John. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. A man who's braver than me and braver than all of us in this room. He got , he got whacked. He got whacked. My Steve, right? I went to the hospital with our great First Lady that night. Right, honey? And we saw a man that was not going to make it. He was not going to make it. He was , the doctor , and I told him his wife , I said, 'She loves you.' 'Why do you say that?' Because she was devastated. A lot of wives wouldn't give a damn. (Laughter.) A lot of , a lot of wives , a lot of wives would have said, 'Oh, yeah.' I said, 'How's he doing?' 'Oh ' She couldn't even talk. She was inconsolable. Most wives would say, 'Not good. Listen, I'm going home now.' (Laughter.) But the doctor came in , the wife is like , she was a total mess. She was really devastated. And he really , it looked like he had a 20, 25 percent chance. I think you set a record for blood loss. And, Steve Scalise, I , actually, honestly, I think you're better looking now. You're more handsome now. (Laughter.) You , you weren't that good looking. You look good now. (Laughter.) He looks better now. Can you believe it? I don't know what the hell that is. (Applause.) It's true. Better now. (Applause.) What a guy. And he was practicing , he was practicing for the baseball game against, I guess, the Democrats, right? And this whack-job started shooting. Hurt Roger , I don't know if Roger is here. But hurt a number of people , hit them. But really hit Steve. He , Steve was at second base. He was the second baseman. And he went down and it was terrible. I mean, I saw the whole thing and it was terrible. Fortunately, you had two brave policemen with you. Because of your high position in Congress, you had two policemen and they were amazing , the man and a woman. And they came and they didn't have rifles. They were against a, supposedly, pretty good sharpshooter with rifles , good equipment. And all they had was a gun. And they started coming in from the outfield, shooting. And they're so far away that a handgun is not preferred. This guy has the rifle and he's hitting people. And he was going to move up and there was no out. I mean, if he would have been able to move up, there was no way to get out. The entrance was a single entranceway on the other side, where he was. So everyone went into the dugout , ran into the dugout, but Steve was really hit badly in the stomach, and , with a bullet that rips you apart. It was supposed to do that. It rips , it rips you apart. And these two people came charging forward. Boom. Boom. Boom. And one of them , you know who , one of them , him? , got the shooter. Hit him. And then got him. Killed him from the long distance. It was amazing. If you didn't have those two people , you can imagine, right? You could imagine what would happen. So Melania and I went to the hospital that night. And he was in such bad shape, and he's been working ever since, so hard. But six months ago, they had a baseball game at the Nationals Park. And I'm watching and it's , it's on television. And it's just, you know, a game. People , you want to win it, right? And Steve's at second base. The poor guy can't even walk. Do you remember Bobby Richardson for the New York Yankees? He was known for range, Louie. Range. He had the greatest range. If a ball is hit to shortstop , Bobby Richardson is the second player, the second baseman , Bobby Richardson would field the ball. If it's hit to first base, he'll throw it to the first baseman. He had unbelievable range. This was not Steve Scalise. (Laughter.) Steve had no range. (Laughter.) One foot and he has to fall down, right? Because, you know, he was trying to get better. I don't know who the hell put you on the field. (Laughter.) And this is a true story. So the game starts and the first pitch , Steve is standing at second base and the guy is really in bad shape. And I said, 'This is terrible.' A shot , groundball shot is hit to second and Steve. I say , I didn't have time to think too much, but I said, 'This is not good. That ball is going toward him.' And this guy stopped that ball, caught the call. He's now laying down. He throws the ball to first base. He gets him out. I said, 'It's the most incredible thing.' I've never seen , athletically , (applause) , I've never seen anything like it, right? And he gets him out and they then took him out of the game, which was a very wise thing because you could never do that again in a million years. (Laughter.) But you weren't going to let that ball go through. I don't care if it was hit by the greatest of all time, right? That ball was not going through you, because you are a warrior. Steve is , he is fantastic. You are fantastic. You and Liz and Kevin. What a great , what a group. I mean, what a group. I got lucky. I got lucky because you need the right people. If I had the wrong people there, he , maybe a different story. Maybe we'd be celebrating something else. But I really want to thank you, Steve Scalise. And, Elise, you , I just read this story; she's the most incredible , what's going on with you, Elise. So I even said , you know, I was up campaigning for her, helping her. But I thought, 'She looks good. She looks like good talent.' But did I not realize, when she opens that mouth, you were killing them, Elise. (Laughter.) You were killing them. (Applause.) Elise , and there's a big story in the New York Post , I love the New York Post because they treat me well. There aren't too many of you that do. But today, you're treating me well. I even had a great headline , New York Times, Washington Post. I had all of these great headlines. Maybe we should just end it right there. (Laughter.) But you had the greatest story, yesterday in the Post, that people from all over the country are contributing to her campaign. They were so enthralled with the way you handled yourself, what you said, the way you said it. And I'll always be your friend. I think it was , it's really an amazing story. What a great future you have. What a great future. Thank you. (Applause.) The First Lady agrees, by the way. The First Lady agrees. And Michael Turner, you can represent me anytime. Where's Michael? Where is he? (Applause.) Or you can represent me. How good were you? There's another , there's another Perry Mason type, I think. Right? What do you think, John? But, Michael, you were fantastic and we appreciate it. Brad Wenstrup. Where's Brad? Brad. (Applause.) Great, great job. This is a big day for lawyers. You notice only the lawyers stayed? All the lawyers stayed behind. Lee Zeldin. How good are you? How good are you? (Applause.) Man. And, Louie, your name is not down. They didn't give me your name. Do you know , if I didn't announce Louie , (laughter) , whoever the hell made this list, I got to get rid of because I , if I wouldn't have announced Louie, it might have been the end of the presidency. (Laughter.) Louie, you have been so great. So tough and so smart. I got it just , (laughs) , I got it. But Louie has been amazing. He's a tough guy. He's a smart guy. He's streetwise like crazy. We love Texas, and we're with you all the way, Louie. We're with you all the way. Thank you very much. (Applause.) So that's the story. We have a great group of warriors, and there are others left, and, I guess, probably, I'm sure I didn't mention a few, and I apologize if that's the case. How's CPAC doing? Good? Huh? My man, stand up please, will you? He's the one who said, 'You should run.' (Applause.) Right? Matt said , it's like five years ago, six years ago. And I made a speech, and then they do some kind of a straw poll: 'Who made the best speech?' And he said, 'I made the best speech.' With all this professional , I hate to say this: With all these professional politicians, they voted, by far, the best speech was Trump. He calls me, he says, 'You should run for politics.' I say, 'What do I know about politics?' But you know what? We learned quickly, and our country has never done better than it's doing right now. (Applause.) So it's been good. (Applause.) But thank you, Matt. Great. Say hello. So that's the story. We've been treated very unfairly. Fortunately, we have great men and women that came to our defense. If we didn't, this would have been a horrific incident for our country. When you have Lisa and Peter, the lovers, the FBI lovers: 'I want to believe the path you threw out for' Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. That's the office. 'There's no way he gets elected' , meaning me. 'There's no way he gets elected.' This is Peter, to Lisa. He's probably trying to impress her, for obvious reasons. (Laughter.) 'There's no way he gets elected. But I'm afraid we can't take the risk.' Now, think of this. In other words, if I get elected, they can't , 'they'; two low-lifes , they can't take the risk. They can't take the risk. Think of it. And that's where it came up, the greatest word of all: 'insurance policy.' So he says, 'But I'm afraid we can't take the risk. She may lose.' It's like an insurance policy. In the unlikely event you die before you're 40 , in other words, if I won, they were going to do exactly what they did to us. They were going to try and overthrow the government of the United States , a duly elected president. And if I didn't fire James Comey, we would have never found this stuff. Because when I fired that sleazebag, all hell broke out. They were ratting on each other. They were running for the hills. Let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. It's in the hands of some very talented people. We're going to have to see what happens. But I can tell you, in my opinion, these are the crookedest, most dishonest, dirtiest people I've ever seen. They said , this is Strzok: 'God, Hillary should win 100 million to one.' This is about me. This is an agent from the FBI. Look how they let her off. Thirty-three thousand emails deleted. Nothing happens to her. Nothing happens. It's unbelievable. But think of that , 'God, Hillary should win' , when these guys are investigating Hillary. Then they go to work for Mueller , the two of them , and when Muller found out that everybody knew that they were 100 percent this way, he let them go. But they deleted all of their emails and text messages. So when we got the phone, they were all deleted. Could you imagine the treasure trove? They illegally deleted. So they left. They left Bob Mueller. He had the look, but he didn't have a lot of other things. Always had the look. Mr. G-Man. And I love the FBI and the FBI loves me , 99 percent. It was the top scum. And the FBI people don't like the top scum. So think of that: 100 million to one. And he's investigating me. And then, 'God, Trump is a loathsome human being, isn't he?' These are the people looking at me. I'm really not a bad person. And Page said, 'Yes, he's awful.' How would you like to have that? This is just , this is the good stuff. There's stuff a hundred times worse than that. These are all dirty people. And now, I just heard that they're suing the United States of America because they were interfered with. We're not going to let it happen. Just not going to let it happen. We cannot let this happen to our country. We can't. (Applause.) So, I'm going to leave now. And I don't know if any of you have anything to say. You could say it. But this is sort of a day of celebration, because we went through hell. And I'm sure that Pelosi and Cryin' Chuck , I've known this guy all the , the only time I ever saw him cry was when it was appropriate. Known him for a long time. Cryin' Chuck. But I'm sure they'll try and cook up other things. They'll go through the state of New York. They'll go through other places. They'll do whatever they can. Because instead of wanting to heal our country and fix our country, all they want to do , in my opinion, it's almost like they want to destroy our country. We can't let it happen. Jim Jordan, did you want to say something? Go ahead. Huh? Mark? Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) This was a highly partisan situation. Pelosi said , I copied it down exactly. Before the impeachment , she wanted to impeach from day one, by the way. Don't let it fool you. You know, she said, 'No, the impeachment is a very serious thing.' I said, 'She wants to impeach. Watch.' Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan , bipartisan. It was 197 to nothing. And other than one failed presidential candidate , and I call that 'half a vote' because he actually voted for us on the other one. But we had one failed presidential candidate. That's the only half a vote we lost. So, we had almost 53 to nothing. We had 197 to nothing. And the only one that voted against was a guy that can't stand the fact that he ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of the presidency. But she said, 'There's something so compelling , it has to be so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan. I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country' , she was right about that , 'and it's just not worth it.' That was Nancy Pelosi a year ago. Right? And I think it's a shame. I think it's a shame. But as I said, if we can put this genius to work on roads and highways and bridges and all of the things we can do , prescription drugs. You know, we had , Secretary Azar is here and I want to thank him for this, but we had , first time in 51 years, where drug prices actually came down last year. First time in 51 years. But what we can do, working with both parties in Congress, is , would be unbelievable. It would be unbelievable , all we can do. And I know Chuck Grassley is working very hard on it and Mitch is working very hard on it. But what we can do is , is incredible. What we can do, just generally. We've done so much without it. We've rebuilt our military. We've cut regulations at a level that nobody thought possible. We'll always protect our Second Amendment; we all know that. But I just want to tell you that it's an honor to be with you all. I want to apologize to my family for having them have to go through a phony, rotten deal by some very evil and sick people. And Ivanka is here, and my , my sons and my whole family, and that includes Barron. (Applause.) That includes Barron, who is up there as a young boy. Stand up, honey. (Applause.) Ivanka, thank you, honey. Come. Come. (Applause.) (The President hugs Ivanka Trump.) Come here, baby. (Applause.) (The President hugs the First Lady.) So I just want to thank my family for sticking through it. This was not part of the deal. I was going to run for President, and if I won, I was going do a great job. I didn't know that I was going to run, and then when I got in, I was going to have to run again and again and again. Every week, I had to run again. That wasn't the deal, but they stuck with me. And I'm so glad I did it because we are making progress and doing things for our great people that everybody said couldn't be done. Our country is thriving. Our country is just respected again. And it's an honor to be with the people in this room. Thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)",

         "Signed into law on January 1, 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires Federal agencies to consider and inform the public of the environmental effects of proposed major Federal actions. NEPA's enactment was the culmination of legislative efforts to establish a national environmental policy and incorporate the consideration of environmental issues into the Federal Government's decision-making processes. Today, on the 50th anniversary of this milestone legislation, we take the opportunity to reflect upon NEPA's goals of protecting our Nation's natural resources and recommit to ensuring a safe, healthy, and productive environment for all Americans. From commuting to work or school and turning on lights at home to having access to clean, reliable drinking water, the daily activities of all of our citizenry are affected by NEPA's requirements. Many projects involving the construction of roads, bridges, highways, airports, transmission lines, conventional and renewable energy projects, broadband deployment, and water infrastructure, as well as management activities on public lands, such as grazing, forest management, wildfire protection, and environmental restoration projects, must undergo Federal environmental review before they can proceed. While the goals of NEPA remain the same as they did 50 years ago, the environmental review process designed to improve decision making has become increasingly complex and difficult to navigate. Project sponsors and ordinary Americans seeking decisions on permits from the Federal Government can face significant uncertainty and delays that can increase costs, derail important projects, and threaten jobs for American workers and labor union members. To improve Federal agency coordination and make environmental reviews and permitting processes far less time-consuming, I directed Federal agencies to implement a One Federal Decision policy for major infrastructure projects. Under this policy, agencies are working to complete environmental reviews within 2 years. Additionally, I directed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to modernize the Federal environmental review and decision-making process. As a result, CEQ has conducted a thorough review of its NEPA implementing regulations and will soon issue a proposal to update those regulations to address the many concerns my Administration has heard from hardworking Americans, small businesses, and State and local officials. Moreover, my Administration is delivering on my promise to continue cutting burdensome regulations and has issued almost eight deregulatory actions for every one new regulation imposed over the past 3 years, helping unleash the full potential of America's economy. My Administration remains committed to improving the environmental review and permitting process while ensuring environmental protection. This will benefit our economy and environment while also enhancing the quality of life for current and future generations of Americans. Today, we celebrate NEPA's 50th anniversary and its role in protecting our environment as we look forward to improving its implementation for the 21st century.",

NOBODY TAKES THE RESPONSIBILITY MORE SERIOUSLY THAN YOU DO IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. YOU THINK FOR YOURSELVES, YOU KNOW OUR PARTY AND YOU KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS. I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES, AMERICA'S CHARACTER IS LITERALLY ON THE BALLOT. WE HAVE TO ACT.

BUT HE SAID, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK, AND HE MEANT IT. IT TOOK HIM THREE YEARS TO MOVE TO DELAWARE AND GET US A HOUSE TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN, BUT HE WAS CONFIDENT IT WOULD BE OK. BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE TODAY ARE ABLE TO LOOK THEIR CHILDREN AND THE EYE FACED WITH THAT KIND OF CRISIS AND SAY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK? THEY DON'T THINK IT IS GOING TO BE OK, BECAUSE WE HAVE MADE IT SO MUCH HARDER IN THIS COUNTRY UNDER THIS PRESIDENT, THAT IT WON'T MAKE IT OK.

         "Thank you all. Thank you for that warm welcome back to Heritage Foundation, which throughout the course of my public life, and back in my days in Indiana when I formed a small think tank to focus on state issues , Kay, I have to be honest with you, Heritage Foundation will always feel like home. And I thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome. (Applause.) To the members of Congress who join us here today , great leaders on Capitol Hill; distinguished guests; ambassadors; and to all of you who, every day, are working in these hallways and oftentimes on the airwaves of America, building a nation and freedom, opportunity, and prosperity, and civil society flourish, it is an honor to be here today with each and every one of you. And while I'm grateful for that kind introduction, would you all just join me in thanking someone whose life and career are synonymous with the conservative movement? She's been a champion of the American Dream, and now she leads the Heritage Foundation with great distinction. Kay Coles James, thank you. (Applause.) Please, stand up and take a bow. It really is great to be back. You know, three years ago, I spoke to Heritage Foundation as Vice President-elect. And I remember at the time, Kay, that you warned me that the White House has a tendency to turn people prematurely gray. (Laughter.) But, honestly, I haven't changed a bit. (Laughter.) You know, the Heritage Foundation is a flagship of freedom. Since its founding in 1973, Heritage has been advancing conservative public policy based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, traditional values, and, from its very founding, focused on a strong national defense. And now for nearly half a century, it's undeniable the Heritage Foundation has made a difference for America. (Applause.) And allow me to bring greetings from a great fan of Heritage Foundation, and a great champion of all the ideals and values that are synonymous with this great institution. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, as I told Heritage Foundation three years ago, when I gathered with each and every one of you, when President-elect was preparing to enter office, we believed then that our President had won a mandate for leadership and he'd make good use of it. Our transition office went right to work the morning after the election. The truth is, I'll never forget the night of Election Night, it was all called in, the President had gotten the phone call. We gave the speeches at the podium. It was about 4:30 in the morning. And as we were leaving the hotel, I'll never forget the President-elect looked at me and he said, 'I'll tell you what , it's been a long night. Let's not get started until 8:30 tomorrow morning.' (Laughter.) And when I got to the office, he was already at his desk. But we went right to work, taking the policies that the President-elect had campaigned on , the policies that the Heritage Foundation had advanced for decades , and worked to build a team to put them into practice. And let me acknowledge one of our helpful volunteers on our transition team who played a vital role in assembling a team that's been making America great again ever since. Would join me in thanking my friend, Dr. Ed Feulner, who's with us today and has played such a vital role , (applause) , yesterday, today, and tomorrow for freedom. Thank you, Ed. (Applause.) Great job. Now, we are gathered here today to talk about trade and economic growth. The Heritage Foundation has long understood that to provide for the common defense is the first object of the federal government. And I'm proud to report to all of you gathered here that, from the first days of this administration, under President Trump's leadership, we've been working to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. Just last month, President Trump completed a budget deal that secured $738 billion for our military. And that'll represent the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We've rebuilt our military. We've restored the arsenal of democracy. And with the strong and unwavering support of these very same members of Congress and all those they represent, we are finally again giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources they need to accomplish their mission and keep our nation safe. (Applause.) So, thank you all. And with that renewed American strength, our armed forces have taken the fight to our enemies on our terms, on their soil. We secured freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. We brought North Korea to the negotiating table. And our armed forces captured the last inch of territory controlled by the ISIS caliphate earlier this year. (Applause.) But the truth is, as President Trump has observed, 'Our active-duty personnel are now the best-equipped, best-trained, and most technologically advanced fighting force in the history of the world.' And in the wake of this weekend's unprovoked attack on several oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, I promise you: We're ready. As the President said, we 'don't want war with anybody,' but the United States is prepared. We're locked and loaded. And we're ready to defend our interests and our allies in the region , make no mistake about it. As the President said yesterday, it's 'certainly looking like' Iran was behind these attacks. And our intelligence community, at this very hour, is working diligently to review the evidence. And the Secretary of State is traveling to Saudi Arabia today to discuss our response. But if the attacks were initiated from Iran, the truth is they would just be the latest in a series of increasingly dangerous escalations instigated by the Islamic Republic. In the past few months alone, the Iranian regime has deployed their regional proxies to stage sabotage attacks against shipping in the Persian Gulf. They've supplied and trained their Houthi allies in Yemen to launch nearly 100 drone strikes against Saudi targets. And, in July, they openly exceeded the limits to their stockpile of low-enriched uranium that they agreed to in 2015. Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world, and it's the greatest threat to peace and security in the Middle East. That's why President Trump withdrew from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal and initiated a maximum pressure campaign against the regime in Tehran. And the truth is, our maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime is working. But know this: If Iran conducted this latest attack to pressure President Trump to back off, they will fail. America is ready to defend our interests. And because of the President's strong action to advance American energy independence, we're also less vulnerable today to threats to the global oil supply than ever before. This year, the United States will actually become a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years. (Applause.) And the President has authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as needed, to keep energy markets well supplied, and he's also directed appropriate agencies to expedite approval of oil pipelines. These attacks against our allies and the global energy supply will fail. But as I close on this point, let me say we're evaluating all the evidence. We're consulting with our allies. And the President will determine the best course of action in the days ahead. But I promise you, under President Donald Trump, America will maintain our energy dominance, we will maintain our momentum toward energy independence. And the United States of America will take whatever action is necessary to defend our country, our troops, and our allies in the Gulf. You can count on it. (Applause.) So we've been standing strong for our military and the national defense. But on this Constitution Day, I'm proud to report that we've also been standing strong for the Constitution itself, for the principles of limited government, for the values enshrined in our founding documents. You know, the Heritage Foundation has always been a bulwark of traditional values. And as I stand before you today, I couldn't be more proud to serve as Vice President to a President who stands without apology for the unalienable right to life. (Applause.) In one of the President's first acts in office, he reinstituted the Mexico City Policy to make sure that American tax dollars would not be used to promote or provide abortion around the world. And we've expanded it in recent days. And I don't know if I've had a higher honor, as President of the Senate, the day I cast the deciding vote to allow states across America to defund Planned Parenthood. (Applause.) But as we've stood for the unalienable right to life, the President also stood strong for the constitutional foundation of our courts. And I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to pay one more debt of gratitude and boundless admiration to a man who has been a champion of our Constitution, a champion of the values and ideals that have made this nation great throughout its long and storied career. Would you all join me in thanking Attorney General Ed Meese for all he has done for America? (Applause.) Thank you, General. General Meese will be glad to know , and he's been a great counselor on this point , that, as a candidate, our President promised to appoint strict constructionists to our federal courts at every level in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia. And that's just what he's done. And I'm proud to report, in the last two and a half years, President Trump has appointed 150 federal judges to our courts, and they're all conservatives who are committed to upholding the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, including the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) We're making historic progress, strengthening the constitutional foundation of our courts through the appointments this President has made and will continue to make. But Democrats and their allies in the media are obviously getting desperate. After dominating our courts for more than a generation, leading Democrats today are now openly calling for packing the Court. And this week, they've even taken to smearing a sitting justice on the Supreme Court of the United States with discredited allegations. The calls by Democrat candidates for president to remove Justice Kavanaugh from the Court are a disgrace and nothing short of an attack on our independent judiciary. Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a good and decent man, he is a principled jurist and a credit to the highest court in the land, and these attacks on Justice Kavanaugh must stop. (Applause.) So we've been standing strong for our national defense, for the rule of law, and for our values. But under this President, we've also been taking action to get this economy moving again, which brings us here today , one more opportunity to add even more momentum to an American economy that is booming. The truth is, from day one, we've been putting into practice the very principles that Heritage Foundation has stood for since its founding in 1973: lower taxes, less regulation, more American energy, and greater individual liberty. From the early days of this administration, President Trump has rolled back red tape at a historic level. In fact, this President has signed more laws cutting federal red tape already than any President in American history, saving more than $33 billion in regulatory costs. We've also unleashed American energy. This President withdrew America from the disastrous Paris Climate Accord. And today, the United States, as I mentioned, is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And, of course, it wasn't just rolling back regulations and unleashing American energy. This President kept his promise in the early days of this administration when he signed into law the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. (Applause.) In fact, businesses saw a corporate tax rate reduction from one of the highest in the industrialized world to 21 percent. It was the largest percentage point reduction in the top marginal corporate rate in the history of this country. We also cut taxes for working families. We doubled the child tax credit. We doubled the standard deduction. And now the typical family of four is saving about $2,000 a year. The result of all of that , less regulation, less taxes, more American energy , has truly been remarkable. As I stand here today at the Heritage Foundation, I'm proud to report, since Election Day, businesses large and small across this country have created more than 6 million new jobs, and the unemployment rate has hit a 50-year low. (Applause.) In two and a half short years, more than 7 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. And wages are rising at their fastest pace in more than 10 years. In fact, the average worker has seen their wages go up by more than $1,000 in the last year alone. The economy is soaring. And you really , you don't need to hear it by studying statistics. These congressmen will attest we hear it on the street every single day. I had that happen myself when Karen and I slipped away down to the Fort Myers area for a couple of days on the beach earlier this year. We were sitting there in our ball caps and our sunglasses taking in a few enjoyable hours of rest there on the beach, and these two fellas came walking by wearing big Budweiser t-shirts. And one of them stopped and turned to me and he said, 'Hey, you're Vice President Mike Pence.' (Laughter.) And I said, 'Yes, I am.' (Laughter.) And he looked at me and he said, 'Well, listen, you got to tell the President that he's got to keep doing what he's doing because I made twice as much money last year as I did the year before.' And I told him I'd tell the President word for word. And I did it. (Applause.) It's true. And then he took three steps away, and he turned back, and looked at me and he said, 'Now, I don't know what you do, but keep doing what you're doing too.' (Laughter.) I told him I would. (Laughter.) I mean, the truth is, we're here today , we're here today because of the tremendous progress that we've made. But I'm also here today to talk about a great opportunity , an opportunity before us to build on the momentum that we've seen in this economy. I'm here today to call on the Congress of the United States to pass the largest trade deal in American history. It's time for Congress to pass the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement. (Applause.) You know, this President was no fan of NAFTA. He often reflected on the campaign trail what I saw back in the state of Indiana, about the impact , unintentional or otherwise , that NAFTA had on many communities, many factories across the country that had closed in the last quarter century. But he promised that we could do better. He promised that we'd sit down with Mexico and Canada and negotiate a new deal that would put , that put jobs and prosperity first. And he did just that. Now, I got to tell you, I was in on a lot of those discussions with President Obrador's predecessor and with Prime Minister Trudeau in Canada. I saw this President drive a hard bargain, but I also saw our neighbors to the north and the south negotiate in good faith. So let me take this opportunity to not only thank Mexico and Canada, but let me also give you a chance to join me in thanking their representatives who are with us today: The Ambassador of Canada to the United States of America, Kirsten Hillman, and Mexico's Ambassador to the United States, Martha B�rcena. Would you stand up and let us show you how much we appreciate your efforts? (Applause.) Thank you. The truth is, as you all know here at the Heritage Foundation, since the early post-war era, America's prosperity has rested on the ingenuity, the determination, the hard work of the American people. But it's also , also rested on robust trade with freedom-loving nations around the world. It was a landmark free trade agreement, after all, that helped revive the global economy after the Second World War. In 1947, the United States and 22 other nations came together to forge an agreement that leveled the playing field for American businesses. It actually laid a foundation for decades of economic growth. It's called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. And early on, it worked. It worked to create prosperity in this country and really helped the world recover from the devastations of war. Tariffs in industrialized countries fell an average of 40 percent to around 5 percent today. But, frankly, today, as we've negotiated trade agreements among so many different countries with so many different interests, too many countries around the world, in the decades that have followed, have taken advantage of the United States in the process, often to the detriment of hardworking Americans. And President Trump, as a candidate and as your President, has called them out and demanded that we put American jobs and American workers first. The truth is, though, one administration after another stood by and watched unfair trade practices hollow out American manufacturing in particular. This President promised to fight for American jobs and American workers. Three years ago, the businessman-turned-candidate said that, 'No longer will we enter into these massive trade deals with many countries that are thousands of pages long, that no one from any country reads or understands.' And he's demanded that we move forward. We withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We signed up the toughest and smartest trade negotiators we've ever had to crack down on China's unfair trade practices and negotiate new trade deals with our partners around the world. We've ended the era of economic surrender. And we're using the power of the strongest economy in the history of the world to put our jobs and our workers first. And now, American jobs and American workers are winning again. You know, I remember when the last administration lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. And, literally, the last President said that those jobs were gone for good, remember? He said, what are you going to , 'You got a magic wand to bring them back?' Well, we didn't need a magic wand; we just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. We've seen 500,000 manufacturing jobs created since Election Day alone. (Applause.) The truth is, we've been working hard to open up markets around the world to goods and services: Argentina to American pork, Vietnam to American grain, the European Union to American beef. And time after time, as our friends from Canada and Mexico can attest, the President has been calling for free and fair and reciprocal trade, driving a hard bargain to open up markets to countries that have access to the American consumer. And since we took office, the President pursued an ambitious trade agenda that's been built on those principles of free and fair and reciprocal trade. We dramatically improved our trade agreement with South Korea. Three years ago, we reached an agreement in principle on a first stage. Just a few months ago, the first stage of a free trade agreement with Japan. Two weeks ago, I told Prime Minister Boris Johnson that the United States is ready to immediately begin negotiations on a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom as soon as Brexit is complete. And we're ready. (Applause.) Beyond all that, this President put China on notice that the decades of massive trade deficits, intellectual property theft, and forced technology transfer , the decades of China ignoring the rules of international commerce , are over. But I came here today to talk about why it's absolutely vital for Congress pass the USMCA. According to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA will add nearly $70 billion in investments in this country and create nearly 180,000 American jobs just in the early going. In total, American exports to Canada, we believe that we'll see increases by $19 billion, and exports to Mexico will increase by $14 billion. And while NAFTA passed before even dial-up Internet, the brand new Digital Trade Chapter of the USMCA contains the strongest language on digital trade of any international agreement in history. And the USMCA will be a big win for American energy as well. Canada and Mexico are the top two destinations for American oil, already receiving nearly 30 percent of our exports. And that number will only increase under the USMCA. It will keep Mexico's energy resources open to development by American companies, and it will guarantee no tariffs on American oil. The USMCA also levels the playing field for American workers and American jobs. Under the USMCA, 75 percent of auto parts in duty-free cars must be made right here in North America, and a significant portion of these parts must be made by workers making a base wage of at least $16 per hour. We believe that this will eliminate the historic incentive to move manufacturing jobs out of the United States of America. President Donald Trump is putting American jobs and American workers first. (Applause.) And I know we're all watching as the news between the UAW and General Motors , the strike that began yesterday. But I have a respectful message for all the United Auto Workers who are currently on strike. As the President said, we hope and trust you'll work out your differences with GM. But while you're at it, if you really want to support our nation's auto workers, the UAW and GM ought to tell Congress to pass the USMCA and make sure there's more autoworkers jobs for decades to come. (Applause.) So the record is clear: The USMCA is a win. It's a win for American energy. It's a win for American agriculture. It's a win for American manufacturing. As I stand before you today, I'm proud to report the President has done his job. Canada and Mexico are doing their job. Now we need Congress to do its job and pass the USMCA. And it's more than just a good deal between our three countries. Experts often reflect that the USMCA is so advanced, it's so comprehensive that, it may well serve as a template , a model trade agreement , for future trade agreements in the decades ahead, whether with the United Kingdom, Japan, the European Union, or even China. And by passing the USMCA, it will also strengthen the President's hand in the negotiations with that last country. By bringing North America together, by demonstrating our ability to unify our economy with our neighbors to the north and the south, it will only strengthen the President's hand as we demand that China end the trade abuses that have characterized the decades of the past. The USMCA will further strengthen our economy and create jobs at a time when other economies around the world are slowing. And it's an idea whose time has come. So I promise you: We're going to keep fighting. We're going to keep fighting for American jobs, for American opportunities, and we're going to keep fighting to get the USMCA across the line. But I came here today to the Heritage Foundation because all of you know that the greatest force this country has ever known, that has the greatest impact on the future of this nation, is always the voice of the American people. And so I want to encourage all the leaders in this room to let your voice be heard. Leave here today and do like I'm going to do: Head straight to Capitol Hill and tell the Congress to pass the USMCA for America. (Applause.) If all of us do all we can to let our voice be heard, I promise you we'll get the USMCA done, and I believe we can get it done this year. So it's great to be with all of you today at the Heritage Foundation. I thank you for coming out. I look around this room and feel like I'm watching cable television. (Laughter.) There's so many well-known faces and voices here, I'm actually very honored that you would take time to hear us out. And to come here to be part of the Heritage Foundation's long tradition of being a platform talking about how we advance the agenda and the principles that have made this country great in the past and are making America great again as we speak. I mean, the truth is, Heritage Foundation has been a bulwark. It's been a bulwark of freedom and a leading defender of the Constitution now for almost a half a century. And as I end here today, I can't help but think about the fact that it's Constitution Day; that more than two centuries ago, on this day, the Constitution was signed. And later on today, I will have the great privilege of participating in a Naturalization Ceremony with a room full of new Americans who will come to the White House to swear their allegiance to this country and swear their oath to that Constitution of the United States. But I think of the preamble of that Constitution on a day like today, and of all the years that have passed since, the words the Constitution began with that, 'We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution the United States of America.' When they walked out of that hall in Philadelphia, history records that a little old lady walked up to Benjamin Franklin, asked him what kind of government they had created. And he said, it's 'a republic, if you can keep it.' And as I stand before you today, I have a grateful heart not just as your Vice President, but as an American, that we've kept it. We've kept it. We looked at that charge and that preamble. And all of the things that I addressed today give evidence to the fact that the American people, whatever our differences are, we have kept faith with the ideals enshrined in that Constitution. And I believe it's a day of cause for celebration and one that we ought to reflect on and be thankful for, but redouble our commitment today to stand by that Constitution, to stand by those ideals, because it's always been the wellspring of our nation's greatness. And as we keep faith with that Constitution and with the American people, I know , as people at Heritage Foundation have known for nearly 50 years , that the best days for the greatest nation on Earth are yet to come. So thank you. God bless you. God bless the Heritage Foundation. (Applause.) And God bless America. (Applause.)",

         "thank you very much wow. I don't know what happened something happened this was supposed to be just a quick little small gathering at this is what's happening and we call it a peaceful protest that way you could moderate how we're supposed to 50 people right so we have a little more and they turned away a lot of people outside so we'll call it a peaceful protest that we could do whatever we want. You know that's what they call it in New York in these different places Portland when they're rioting all over the streets they say it was a peaceful protest you could have thousands of people doing it we'll do the same thing I'm truly Brill to be here with you the hard work patriots of Wisconsin thank you. It's a big group of people. This is like a rally and so that's supposed to be a rally Woodard's the 1st Her lawyer. I hereby grade your pardon Right here thank you very much. Rob I want to thank you thank you in the months ahead we will need. Every ounce of your strength and drive and patriotism we're in a fight for the survival of our nation and civilization itself we are really in a fight. This is the most important election we've ever had in my opinion and I used to say it and I'd say it with great conviction 2016 but you know what that was a crazy people we were dealing there with or you know when the on the edge could get Hillary was on the edge she was on the verge she became crazy later on when she lost us which he began. But these are people that are seriously radical left Joe Biden is nothing but their puppet he has no clue what's happening. Or are or i'm them making speeches that are taped who want to listen to Michelle Obama do what they basically. Are you got to have her get up there. But we're doing a real speech on Thursday next Thursday she'll be listening. Doing a live live from the White House live from the White House so we have a we have plenty to say. So Joe Biden the Democrats have pledged to oppose 4 trillion dollars of new taxes so this is a a group of people that think it's good to raise everybody's taxes you know in the old days a politician would lower taxes right the Great Scott Walker is here your governor rather are on. And Scott would lower taxes but now the whole thing I guess it's changed it's got inside out now it really is going to raise your taxes but Republicans are lowering your taxes we gave you the biggest tax decrease of the history of our country and we're going lower had the are but they're going to massively increase your regulations in addition to your taxes they're going to confiscate the guns of law abiding Americans are going to take away your 2nd Amendment. We're going to make America a sanctuary for criminal aliens are going to keep those sanctuary cities they love sanctuary cities they're going to protect the criminals abolish American energy and make us reliant on foreign nations and force taxpayers to fund to extreme late term abortion that's what they're doing. They also want to abolish the suburbs by allowing far left Washington bureaucrats to force the construction of low income housing projects in every neighborhood in America that's what they want to do this is their goal and we're going to let you preserve your American dream in the suburbs Ok we ended the progress bar we ended the program the voters of Wisconsin are very very spectacular people we are going to take care of you at every level we're going to fight for you we're going to fight for every single aspect that you have going we are never going to forget you you didn't forget me in the last election so I want to thank our auto. Thank you everybody thank you I want to thank you very much it's great. So we a shoot a regulation and you know we ended that regulation because when we talk about suburbs and we talk about other things we have taken care of about 84 percent of Obama regulations executive orders. You know it's amazing we knocked out a big portion of what he did including the wonderful mandate right the individual mandate in Obamacare which totally by the way by far the worst of all of Obamacare we didn't get out the centrally that ended Obamacare and then you say so we knocked out 84 percent of what he did they say he was. Wonderful president why was he a wonderful president if we knocked out and the very popular way not doubt 84 percent the voters of Wisconsin face a simple joys. If you want to be ruled by the radical left or do you want as then tall as free men and women in the greatest country on earth and keep it that way. Was you want to crush our economy under the crazy socialist policies of sleepy Joe Biden And his boss Harris come on. And is not the boss then see Pelosi she's a beauty And is ruler Bernie Sanders crazy. Or do you want to quickly rebuild the strongest economy in the history of the world which we did we're going to have to do it again we're going to have to do it again and we're in the process of doing. We've built the greatest economy on Earth and that we're doing it again you look at all the numbers we're going to go over and you wanted to fund and defame and dismantle the police I don't think so. You want to support the incredible heroes of law enforcement Yes right the laws . You want your friends and family to be persecuted by the far left wing it's called Ted so cold your. Right hand still culture or do you want to defend our history our heroes our faith our values and our treasured American way of life which is what we have laws right thank God I don't believe the lies you're going to hear on tape most is going to be that I wonder is Joe Biden taping his speech too because if he is I think I'll take mine. How do you why. It's a taped they talk about a convention how do you watch a tape speech I would imagine Joe is going to do everything he can today but I saw them asking him questions today it was a news conference and you read him of a teleprompter I don't get it I don't get it something going on up there. We can afford it you know I can tell you this look from doing this now we've got the greatest economy in the world we rebuilt our military we gave you the greatest tax cuts for the greatest regulations. We became energy independent we've done things that nobody thought possible right nobody thought possible we've done things that nobody ever thought you had the greatest year in the history of your state list the greatest here last and when you look at the numbers you're going to have an even greater year next year unless somebody comes in and quadruples your taxes in which case it's called the depression folks it's called a depression it's not going to happen because we're going to win . The war . Biden is just a Trojan horse for socialism he is he's a Trojan horse he has no clue but the people around him a tough and they're smart but we disagree with them very very strongly there mean and they're angry like her by the way nobody treated Joe Biden worse than Kemal right she was worse than Pocahontas she was worse than anybody and say nobody treated him worse or with I mean less respect she had no respect all of a sudden she's now saying is the wonderful she didn't feel that way a little while ago let's talk about her for a 2nd she left in shame she started her 14 she left to do she went in the wrong direction so if that's if a poll is any any indication that's what we want speak it a Polls fake do c.n.n. they probably have their camera going thank you very. Much No no no we have to frankly their poster is much better than Fox because Fox has never gotten it right Vox postered I don't know who he is but he hasn't had a clue for about 7 years let me just let me just tell you that c.n.n. gave us an increase of 10 or 11 points in just a short period of time that we won up and now they call it margin of error don't believe it we're way beyond the margin of error I don't lawyer. I just got back from Texas. And Florida. And Ohio we were all over the place we were we went to great states and every road way highway we had thousands tens of thousands I would say at least on each 100000 people from the plane because you know that's why this isn't a rally this is again friendly protest we were not allowed to do rallies right because of rules and regulations which we want to adhere to but from the plane to an oil well from the plane to getting law enforcement all of the sheriffs in Florida gave us their full endorsement right laws. And in Ohio we went to a plant whirlpool there were at a business there were going out of business and now they're thriving company because they were dumping washing machines and dryers into our country and I stopped it and I said you want to do that we're putting a massive tariff and all of a sudden whirlpool and thousands of people there work at Ohio and other places it became a really terrific company again and we went there but if you look if you look at the kind of enthusiasm we have we have never had the enthusiasm that we have right now and that includes 2016. And I hate to say it and I don't want to be rude because I would never be rude but let me just tell you. Joe Biden has no enthusiasm. No enthusiasm and you don't win without enthusiasm like people aren't saying we got to get him and the only reason they want him in is they want to stop our great agenda that's the only reason that's the only thing is going and nobody wins when you're not on the side of enthusiasm so we have more than we ever had in 2016 and in 2016 nobody has ever see the campaign with that kind of enthusiasm and we have much for our Earth at the socialist will not stop until they've ransacked America and laid waste to our cities your eyes don't lie look at Portland it's been turned into a war zone and we want to go in and solve it we save the courthouse you believe it we had to send in homeland security they were great they easily saved it after was pounded Portland was supposed to be watching it but they weren't so we said to men and we will send in the National Guard just like we did in Minnesota you saw what happened there Minneapolis the National Guard went in within 15 minutes all thing was over they should have called them in a week earlier . Oh thank my beautiful beautiful 5th Avenue in New York has been looted and pillaged it was allowed to happen by an incompetent mare that doesn't have a clue look at what's happened to our dime in New York was a diamond for the country look how far it's gone down in Chicago the mayor literally raised up the drawbridge is to prevent hordes of rioters from ransacking the city can you believe it can you believe 17 officers were injured in Chicago. They had a week a little while ago during a weekend spree where 78 people were shot and 18 died that's worse than Afghanistan which we're getting out of that's worse than Iraq which were almost out of that's worse than Syria which were out of step we kept the oil but that's Ok we have to talk about. God thank God this is the future the Joe Biden plans to bring to every city town and suburb in the nation and you know for those suburbs I keep hearing about suburban women made me. Was Well you know in one speech recently I called you suburban housewives and they all loved it but what I got they censor I don't know if that's politically correct I said don't worry about it they'll get over it right but we say. We save the suburbs the suburbs and you know what I'm talking about and they said about the rule it's a rule very strong it's like a law they said sir we can amend it I said I don't want it amended No we can really amended bring it down no I don't want to I wanted terminated and we terminated it it's gone way and it will be reinstituted if Joe Biden comes and not by him because he has no idea what the law says or what it means but by the people that will be running our country it will not be him it will not be him running our country they will turn every city into a Portland and they wouldn't mind no one will be safe it is a Biden run America but was president the United States will use every tool and we've done it by the way our country is doing great we have the pandemic sure the never been allowed to the never been allowed to happen by Johnny not to the never been allowed to happen. They released it they didn't release it in China but it came to the United States and Europe $188.00 all over the world $188.00 countries all over the world we're not going to forget it we're not going to forget it but we're doing great coming back we're coming back in our numbers are better than almost all countries I will tell us the spite what you hear look at all of them up there thanks got to look at all of that fake news and some believe that. Unfortunately Fox has become vagueness to I don't know what happens to these people right you agree. At least the other side you know where they're coming from but I'll use every tool of my disposal to arrest those violators of federal law and put them behind bars and that's where the our work you know when they were ripping down the statues are great statues they were ripping him down I passed and signed something that's beautiful it says 10 years in prison if you're knocked out is that you know what how far what I have been Scott I don't see it anymore now they go up they look at a statue and they say. 10 years and a long time they say let's get out of here but did you notice that 3 months ago I signed it they were going to have thousands of people March on Washington to rip down statues and these people are sick they're anarchists they were going to knock down Thomas Jefferson George Washington Abraham Lincoln he was fair game Abraham Lincoln so I said these people are sick they are troubled individuals they're an ark is an agitator is there not just protest as they call him peaceful protest is your peaceful protest is on the record you're peaceful broke the law and by the way you're a lot like the sky over here look at the size of that guy you're a lot tougher than they are just so you understand that oh right. There are signs that act Thank you. But Biden and her wrists are pro crime and then take up that there is no other way to say and we're Ed Tykerb we are pro cop all the way I've gotten the endorsement of God The Were I got the endorsement Pat Lynch New York City police they gave us the doors for the 1st time I think he said I think it's the 1st time they've ever done it that means it's been a long time they don't do that kind of thing they endorsed me all the sheriffs in Florida endorsed me what you have all of the law enforcement in Texas said Dorsey we're getting indorsement from we haven't found anybody that a law enforcement we haven't found anybody and if we do I think they'd probably be in big trouble I really do I think they'd be in big trouble because nobody could figure it out we are getting the endorsement of law and these are great people these are great Americans these are people that want our people to be safe . We're thrilled today to be joined by county sheriffs or across the state and I'm deeply honored to receive the endorsement of more than 3 dozen Wisconsin sheriffs Where are you saw a god was the oath and you that thank good looking people with i.q. and I thank you and I like that Maersk Maggette America I wonder if he supports trapeze got married get this big whether he's a trumpet a thank you Sheriff we appreciate a good looking guys good looking guy with an I'll never let you down here so I'll never let you down you know that you know we gave you all of the surplus equipment we had millions and millions of dollars of surplus equipment and. Obama and Biden didn't want to give it they didn't want to give it they thought it looked too militaristic meaning it was a lot of it was really defensive equipment so that we can keep our law enforcement safe and I distributed it all of the hundreds of millions of dollars it was sitting there drawing dust in warehouses that we would probably pay a fortune for all over the country and you got it we all got it everybody got it and everybody's happy God bless as president and as your president I will always stand with law enforcement and that's something that I can't even imagine anybody saying anything differently but this other side does they say it differently I mean nobody can even understand that this November the voters of Wisconsin will not surrender their beloved state to the left wing mob and that's what would happen by a law and in $78.00 days we're going to stop the radical left we're going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win 4 more years was. Was Oh god god god or God or God or God And then there are so that will go for another 4 years because you know what they spite of my campaign we should get a redo of the law we caught him spying on the can you believe it did you see the f.b.i. agent he agreed eaves pleading that he forged documents so that's that's good no no way you see it's going to be incredible but they spidered my campaign they spied on our campaign nobody has ever seen anything like it you can call it whatever you want I use the word treason they got.

The whole board because they start off that we're going to play for New York with all of the crime in New York I'm going to play for New York because we did well in New York. Thank you did well in New York but we're going to play for New York and we're going to play I don't know yes we'll do a little bit of a tiny shot maybe in California they like b..

Was cut the thank you he's an exceptional man Scott Walker Governor Scott Rod was Thal tell you one thing he's one of the most respected men he goes into Washington everybody stands up and they really do respect him a lot and it's really something the next time you run please don't put marijuana on the ballot at the same time you're running you brought out like a 1000000 people that nobody ever knew coming out. Because there was no way but you can do whatever you want you know that you going to be successful what whatever you want to do thank you very much God forbid was so before the virus came in from China thank you unemployment in Wisconsin had reached the lowest rate ever recorded ever recorded. Now as part of Scott's they do I have to give him a little credit there right I have to do that but we created $15000.00 Wisconsin manufacturing jobs everybody said that would be impossible 121000 Wisconsinites were lifted out of poverty and 100000 were lifted off of food stamps because they had good job Thad we had created the single greatest economy in the history of the world our national economy was better than any economy that had ever happened before it and China was having the worst year they had in 67 years not that I want that but we took in billions of dollars we had nobody ever charged China for doing anything what the money they took out of our country for so many years and the presidents that preceded me should be ashamed of themselves for allowing it to happen and that includes sleepy Joe was part of that thank God But then we were hit by the virus and I had to close it up by took the greatest economy and I'd close that up and we saved millions of lives as many lives should have been won but what you see today you could multiply it times 10 or 15 or maybe even 20 it would have been a horrible it would not have been sustainable and now where bringing it back it will bring it back so strongly. Thank you I took unprecedented action to save the us economy and support Wisconsin families under our paycheck protection program we helped save 0. For $1000000.00 Wisconsin jobs earlier this month I issued a directive granting emergency payroll tax relief to every worker making under $100000.00 per year Thad this temporary relief will help tens of millions of American workers that is something that people really out today the great economists that's what they want the payroll tax cut more than any other thing and it really applies number when they open their business is great for them but really great for you and it's a big savings it's a lot of money in your pocket if Republicans win in November we will forgive these payments in full thank God the word Thanks to my administration's policies we're now witnessing the fastest you cut and you've seen this right the fastest economic recovery in the history of our country over the past 3 months we have already gained much more than 9000000 jobs nationwide that's a record that's not even close by the way. And you know you heard about the v. the v the famous 3 and there's a well maybe not a me it's got to be a damn it's got to be it has it's got to be they have no doubt it's turned out to be a super of the because the numbers are much better when you see the numbers coming retail spending has fully recovered and is now at an all time high and auto production has surged 28 percent of the worth and it leaving the great plane right behind me and we have a lot of televisions we have televisions and closets I was saying to another group we have televisions on floors and ceilings we have tele you can't escape but if you want to get away from Trump you can't be on that plane because. The fake news and drop you know they're going to go out of business when I do leave it let's say 60. 20 years something like when we live. When we leave they're all out of business. I wouldn't say that sleepy Joe would be very excited to come right don't think a lot of let's turn on the Biden say today darling. But you know I just noticed on television that Nat stag that's a big deal now as dad hit an all time record today the highest was the highest price ever thank the others are right behind it I mean who would think we have a pandemic I think we're way on the other side of the pandemic we're doing great with vaccines and therapeutics and everything else but regardless we're doing great with it but who would think that we had a record with that stack and the others are right there if you would have said we're at $28000.00 on the Dow We're just about and if you would have said Nasdaq hit a new record high that's great for your for a one k's look you get the wrong person and here you go for a one K.'s wave goodbye to a They'll be worthless they'll be worth right for a one k's that's one of the things a lot of people are bragging you know about 4 months ago they were very depressed I said don't sell don't sell Don't worry about the sell forget about this and most people held and they're very very good but husbands come up to me and wives come up to me and one wife was saying sir I always thought my husband was a financial loser a total loser he was his big good looking policeman actually. And she said you know you've never been good with money but over the years over the last few years I think it was up 89 percent I said that's not as good as most people he said No no my husband is a financial genius and there's good looking policemen said Thank you sir because I was abused for a long time about the way I invested but. Thank. You for a one K.'s a grade and your stocks a great. You know when you see these big companies going up that's everybody that's everybody the stock market that's everybody that's just an indication and they're smart people they know where it's going you know they have it it's think that's better than most people and they see what's happening now with all of that we have a headwind and the headwind is a for any reason we didn't win that stock market is going to go down like a rock goes through water I hate to tell you folks so good look at it we didn't have if we didn't have that headwind your stocks would be even higher right now even higher so on election night expect your 401 K.'s and your stocks to go very very high and I do believe we're going to have a tremendous and. I do believe Thanks again the most enthusiasm that anybody has ever seen in any election is this one the most enthusiasm so we've got to get out and vote got to be careful with your balance be careful be careful here absentee ballots great you're others you've got to be very careful or go to vote just go to vote you know. Go to her. We have a little problem here you have a Democrat governor who is will do anything that they think could turn things around. How is Tom Tiffani doing by the way another when we just had a nice win right is Tom Tom is around here someplace Tom Tiffany just got a great win well winning a lot we've won a lot of House seats we're going to definitely we're going to take back the house the door and say thank you our thanks as part of our great rebuilding the u.s. military we also signed a 5500000000 dollar contract to build combat ships in Marin that Wisconsin supporting thousands of jobs for us thank God thank God. Ah thank. Her or her. Dad or. We've totally rebuilt our military we've spent $2.00 trillion dollars all made in the USA all made in the us. We have new fighter jets we have new rockets we've upgraded our nuclear I hope to God we never have to use it but nobody's even close it was getting very tired getting very tired what we've done with our military is incredible with tanks speaking of tanks we left our great tank I was supposed to close down we have a tank factory in the Lima Lima Ohio and it was scheduled to close and I went to see it I said No way would closing it because there's no way we could ever reproduce. That incredible and and you know it happened we didn't close it and we are building tanks like you wouldn't believe but what we've done with our military has been incredible and Biden has promised to slash our defense budget destroying critical jobs but more importantly if we don't have defense everything we talk about is meaningless we have to have the feds defense of our country especially when you look at what's happening outside of our borders so we have the greatest right now when I took it over was totally depleted it was God right now we have the greatest military we've ever had the greatest equipment by far we've ever had. The data was Thank You have come out and Biden are ever elected this recovery will come to a total shut down to use that word permanently for no scientific reason Biden wants to inflict dramatic harm on millions of Americans with his basement strategy locking everyone in their homes you. Look at what's happening with some of you got a dose of it right here I hate to say with some of these Democrat governors they just don't want to open it up by the way on November 4th they'll announce what we have decided to open November for. Got to get out to those polls I'm serious this is the most dangerous election we've ever had the most dangerous because I don't think we can ever bring it back if they get in I don't think there's anything called a comeback it will be another event as well I used to say that lightly I now say it very strongly because it's a similar ideology this will be a large scale very large scale Venezuela if they win. We're going to weigh my administration by contrast is following the science applying common sense mitigation sheltering bird you know this we've got a shelter we've got to take care but what do we really have to do we have to take care of our elderly people our elderly people with heart problems with diabetes and we'll launch an operation warp speed to deliver effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine therapeutics more than 270 therapies are in clinical trials can you believe it 270 and you're going to be here is a very good news very very soon now you know we're dealing with a deep say right so I'm watching it very closely I don't need to have them announce on November 4th ladies and gentlemen we've found a vaccine that's perfect I don't need that I don't need that and hopefully everyone's looking to do the right thing we want to get it out quickly but we're very close both on therapy and on therapeutics add on vaccines. Advances in treatment. Have reduced the fate Tallinn the rate in adults by 85 percent since April think of that they get heard. 3 vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials and we're mass producing doses already of that vaccine because we think it works and we're going to have it out very quickly we will defeat the China virus we will have the greatest economy that we've ever had next year unless somebody wants to quadruple your taxes and the crazy things that they're talking about we will have next year the single greatest economy we've ever had laws are also Biden has been there for 47 year and he's personally supported every blow bill a sellout of the last half century he voted for NAFTA one of the worst trade deals in history for the China entry into the World Trade Organization a total catastrophe for Korea the Korean deal was horrible we renegotiated it now it's a really great deal for us one in 4 u.s. manufacturing jobs disappeared almost overnight Biden was strongly in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have destroyed our automobile manufacturing business it would have been a disaster for our country I ended it but I approved the Dakota access pipeline immediately the Keystone pipeline 48000 thank you one of the great rip offs that was done in my opinion to hurt our country because we have so much energy we're now energy independent was I got out of this horrible power a slime an accord which was a ripoff for NACA Law Thank God it would have shipped millions of American jobs to China while allowing China to pollute with impunity and they don't even enter the agreement until 2030 so we it would have been a disaster so many things are stacked against us even in the World Trade Organization China. Is considered a developing nation therefore they get tremendous guess what we don't except that we've had 4 of them we don't accept it and we're not it and we're not approving any of those judges until such time as that ends. Are thanks so time and again thanks sleepy Joe Biden put China 1st in American last even to a point where a son who had absolutely wears hunta Has anyone seen one he's had absolutely no experience walked away with one and a half $1000000000.00 to manage as millions of dollars a year and if you go to the pros of Wall Street they'll tell you it's an impossibility it was a 10 minute meeting he walked away with one and a half 1000000000 from China how do you think he's going to do negotiating by against China Ok nobody's done what I've done the Jaina to Russia a by the way remember we're going to be a war in a war with North Korea what happened to the war we're going to go along Kim Jong un we get along let's see what happens and meantime it's almost 4 years right remember we were going to be in a war Thank you look at a look at all those people back that's a lot of people Thad's a lot of wealth and look at all the fake dues is that incredible round. There a lot of it's a lot of fake news back there's got. At the end of Joe Biden's 8 years as vice president nearly 2000000 Americans a prime worky day job dropped out of the workforce our factories were stolen our country was doing wow z. he lost nearly 200000 manufacturing jobs he was by the way a disaster on swine flu he got a horrible rating in Gallup look at the Gallup Poll look at the Gallup poll so they call it. H one n one right here remember h one swine flu h one n one he calls it and one h one but I don't hold them in that. And that's one of the the bigger mistakes is when he says these are the different say when you speak in great to be in a great state of Ohio but don't know no we're not in Ohio. You know what you do it's you know it's you know it you do when that happens you just walk off because there's nothing you can do it or a guy happened to him like $16.00 times almost every time that's why he doesn't talk. He shot he shot we got to say look one thing I've learned. Putin's president she of China right Kim Jong Il heir to one of Turkey they are world class chess players we can have a guy who shot and it is best years wasn't very good he was a very good week and how are these guys a world class Test player thank God they're all dreaming thank their all dreaming of Joe Biden out is dreaming about it is Iran if we win and when we when we are going to have a deal with the Rana mediately they're just waiting hoping that Biden gets in hoping John Kerry is saying oh you should he by the way if anybody violated the Logan Act It was John Kerry right John Kerry not General Flynn and John Kerry. Of course of health insurance for American families had skyrocketed under Obama and Biden by $4800.00 and nearly $11000000.00 more Americans were influenced him so Biden's abysmal record but you do have to check the swine flu because that was peanuts compared to this monster this monster is the worst thing that's happened in this world since 1917 right where it could have been a 100000000 people died swine flu though look at his ratings in Gallup check them out they gave them really bad ratings Joe Biden not that that matters but that does matter right you know when a guy is critical and we've done an incredible job including among the best numbers in the world Joe Biden's abysmal record of failure betrayal ended the day I took the oath of office we got up people back working we made real deals with foreign countries Oh thank you I told Japan I told Japan Thank you Prime Minister Abi great guy but I said Prime Minister you have to build places in Michigan. You have to build your places in other countries and other other areas of our country it's not fair we have a big deficit go to Wisconsin go to Ohio go to these places he said he's going to do it many many Japanese plants now are being built all over a country somebody had asked him to do it somebody had to tell them to do it it's not fair and it was all happening then it came and now it's going out watch what's going to happen watch how good the 3rd quarter is the 3rd quarter is coming up right before the election watch how good Scott Walker what even you will be impressed by those numbers. Even sky Oh Ok but we passed massive tax cuts we passed massive regulation cuts and you know want to you might not feel this may be the most important thing I did for making the economy great wasn't just the tax cuts it was the regulation cuts because the regulation cuts allowed companies to go out and build projects that they couldn't get approved for 15 years and 20 years right or a big deal thanks we'll replace probably the worst trade deal ever NAFTA with the brand new US MCA which puts us right at the top and now Canada and Mexico are doing what's right for our country. Yes but a great deal thank you and when they were his constant temperature and does 3 was being threatened by administration took immediate action we impose tariffs on dumped foreign goods and subsidized products saving countless timber jobs all across your state and you know exactly what I'm talking about you were taken advantage of by stupid US policy Canada was taking. Digit of this country not anymore thank God thank you if Biden and the crew get in the Radical Left will bring timber production to a total halt I stood up to China's decades of trading abuses and when China targeted our farmers we provided $28000000000.00 in relief we gave our farmers I said to Secretary producer of Agriculture Sunny how much they've targeted our farmers How much have they been targeted for server 2 years ago is 12000000000 last year was $1628000000000.00 Dodo I said guess what we're charging tariffs of $28000000000.00 to John and. We charge so much more and we gave 12000000000 in 1628 we gave 28 the farmers in here and the farmers did I do a good job for you please. I don't hear any farmers complain back and I have every right we did a good job with a more typical president I want to be nice more typical every farmer would be out of business right now but we gave 28000000000 to the farmers think of that and the farmers are doing well and then we signed a deal with China and I was very excited because I had a very good relationship with President Xi we signed a great deal and the Under the deal they would buy $240000000000.50 of farm product and then manufacturing once the China flew came in once a china stuff came in I was not really I was and I couldn't it was different but I have to tell you. 4 days ago the court order right was the largest corner order in the history. Of ordering. It was the biggest China ordered 2 days the biggest order in the history of corn then they did if you look at soybeans it was the largest soybean order in history in history and also beef cattle etc So it just shows you how smart China is we signed a deal and the plague comes in it might have been a mistake it might have been on purpose who knows what happened we'll figure it out but whatever it was it was no good they could have stopped it but they know my attitude I don't like it I don't like it so a normal country that's not so smart in that position Scott what is said oh we don't like the way he's talking about us let's immediately shut down he didn't do that they said let's order more from the farmers that we've ordered biggest corn biggest soybean biggest cattle and now I'm getting my farmers and server. We saw in the like China I said you know what we've got to be very careful you understand that so what they've done is they've gone out they've made massive orders so I think how smart that is 99 percent of people in that position would say well we're not going to order any more they say let's order so much that they become almost reliant on us very smart very very smart America's spent nearly 4 years planing up the mess we inherited from Joe Biden's 47 year worth of disaster you know it's incredible he's in there for 47 years he does nothing now all of a sudden he's going to do all these things he's going to get tough on China sure China will own the United States if we don't make this deal and we were going up if we don't get elected China will own that mark my word well I hope you're not going to be able to test it out Ok China well China will own the United States Iran will insist on an even better deal than they made with Obama they got 150000000000 dollars 1800000000 in cash green cash for nothing we got nothing out of that deal and I terminated that deal I terminated and we moved the capital of Israel to Jerusalem. That's been the evangelical Thank you know it's amazing with. The evangelicals some are excited about that then Jewish people it's early right it's incredible but we did we did that and Golan Heights don't forget Golan Heights we did go a lot of time so we've done a lot in February Biden said if you elect me your taxes are going to be raised they're not going to be cut that's a quote How the hell do you do this. That well it's. Only in the state can we get away with. But you have to be right Ok you happened to be right. So I just want to say this this has been an incredible experience for me getting to know you I've been here a lot we won this state we weren't expected to win the state or the author was the Word of God Ah we've been great for each other we've been great for each other it's really you know it's a partnership in a sense but we've been great for each other we brought a lot of business to the state we're bringing a lot more business to the state whether it's the ships or to the crops or any one of the so many different things especially maybe the trade deal with Canada and Mexico because because of Wisconsin and us specialize milk a small subject but the right farmers got me at the right time of this sort Wow you guys are really being taken advantage of with Canada charging you 287 percent tariff I bet I think you mostly know about that but unless you're up here a lot like I was you'd never find that out and I work with Scott and I work with others or we solved all of these problems we solved all of them Scott right. This is the most important election we ever had we've got to stop these radical left maniacs we've got to win this election law with. God. God or God or God or. We have many things to do we want to finish it up it's no different you plant a tree it takes a little time to grab on in addition we have other things we're going to do more regulation cutting even more tax cutting we're going to be doing very substantial. Tax cuts because that's an incentive toward growth and we're going to do it and we proved to be right we proved to be 100 percent right we're not letting them raise your taxes on you and destroy everything that we've done so I just want to thank the incredible people of Wisconsin God lawyer was who really are your only or your estate that despite everything everything that they were saying Well Wisconsin can't be won was going to guess what and I think we're much way far ahead I do believe we're way far ahead where we were if you look back 4 years I think we have much more spirit you see this is easier in a sense now the virus made it a little bit more difficult maybe a lot more difficult because all of a sudden something happened that nobody ever even thought about but we handled it we handled it and we handled it well and we're now helping other countries with the ventilators and other things but the easier part is I used to come up as a businessman I was very successful and I'd say we're going to do this we're going to do tax cuts we're going to even Space Force I never even talked about space but we did more. Somebody said we actually did more than we promise that's never happened with a politician before right we did actually more but I never talked about Space Force and then I got to doff as I said we need that because you look at what China is doing what Russia is doing what others are looking at so we have space for us 1st time in 78 years since the Air Force that that's happened full scale so it's great but and you're a big beneficiary of that as you know. So we have to win the election we can't play games get out and vote do those beautiful absentee ballots or just make sure your vote gets counted make sure because the only way we're going to lose a select. Is if the election is rigged to remember that the only way we're going to lose this election so we have to be very careful look we have this is more than this election that's a big statement the only way they're going to win is that way and we can't let that happen and you know our postoffice we're going to make our Post Office great it's been a disaster for many years we're going to take care of the men and women in the post office and we're going to make it great right now it's a laughing stock Amazon and these companies come in they dop they drop all of their packages into the post office and the post office loses. Trillion me just hundreds of billions of dollars delivering these packages let them deliver to let them pay the right prize you know so that said But we're going to make our post office strong we're going to make our postoffice really strong and really great we're going to be proud of it again it lost $78000000000.00 in a short period of time over the last 12 or 13 years 78000000000 dollars We want to make our postoffice strong we want to be proud of it I want to thank you very much you've been my friends my true friends we will win and we will make America great again",

         "So we're going to North Carolina. We have a packed place, and it's going to be, I think, very exciting, as it was last night in Minnesota. That was an incredible event. We have some very big news on TikTok. TikTok is moving along. We're dealing with Oracle, which you know of. Larry Ellison. And we're dealing with, as a combination, Walmart , Walmart, a great company. A great American company. The security will be 100 percent. They'll be using separate clouds and a lot of very, very powerful security. And they'll be making about a 5-billion-dollar contribution toward education. We're going to be setting up a very large fund toward the education of American youth. And that'll be great. That's their contribution that I've been asking for. But we'll see whether or not it all happens. But, conceptually, I think it's a great deal for America. They'll be hiring at least 25,000 people. It'll most likely be incorporated in Texas. It'll be a brand-new company. It will have nothing to do with any outside land, any outside country. It will have nothing to do with China. It'll be totally secure. That'll be part of the deal, and that will be both Oracle, as you know, and Walmart. And I think it's going to be a fantastic deal. The technology is superior to anything in the world, and we like that. And, again, a lot of jobs, a lot of money. A lot of money for our country. Billions of dollars of taxes will be paid every year. And hundreds of millions of users, and they'll be happy. So everybody will be happy. It's a severance. It'll continue to be named TikTok, as it was all along. And that's it. That's it. So I can say that I have given the deal my blessing. If they get it done, that's great. If they don't, that's okay too. But it's a great deal for America, and very interesting.",

         "Thank you all for. Thank you for that very warm welcome it is an honor to be here today with the men and women of the Alliance Defending Freedom and you are champions for our 1st freedom and it is my great honor to be with all of you today. But before we get started allow me to see a few words about the horrific mass shootings that occurred over this weekend in . El Paso and day. Like all Americans Karen and I were outraged and sickened by these barbaric attacks. As I stand before you today 31 people have died. 53 were injured. And it breaks our hearts. To see so many innocent lives cut short by unspeakable violence. What happened this weekend were acts of pure evil. And we express our deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. And we join every American praying for the injured and their families. In their hour of need. The Bible says The Lord is close to the broken hearted. And that will be our prayer for the people of Dayton and El Paso. We also commend the men and women of law enforcement in both states. Whose quick action. And courageous service undoubtedly saved lives they earned the admiration and gratitude to thousands and as President Trump said his address to the nation yesterday, hate has no place in America. And the sinister ideologies of racism bigotry and white supremacy must be defeated in the wake of previous violence hard ministration worked on a bipartisan basis with the Congress to strengthen background checks and improve school safety. In the wake of this weekend's mass shootings the president has brought the full resources of the federal government to assist law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for these heinous acts. Justice will be swift and certain. The president has also directed the f.b.i. to use all legal means available to disrupt hate crimes and to prevent domestic terrorism before it occurs. We directed the Department of Justice to work with local state federal agencies as well as social media companies to develop new tools to identify those seeking to do harm before they strike. And the president called for all of us to work together to end the glorification of violence in our society and to reform our mental health laws will work to identify entry and where necessary and voluntarily confine all those deemed a risk to themselves or the public safety. And that as we speak guard ministration is working with members of Congress to ensure that all those who pose a risk to public safety are denied access to firearms. And finally because justice delayed is justice denied we're developing legislation to ensure that those who commit mass murders face the death penalty swiftly. In years not decades. And tomorrow the president and the 1st lady will travel to Dayton and El Paso to express the sympathies and support of the American people for all those impacted by these hideous attacks and as a president also said. Now is the time to set destructive partisanship aside and find the courage to answer hatred with Unity devotion and love now is the time to overcome evil with good you know it's always been true throughout the long history of this country that in times of trial the American people turn to faith and prayer. Bible tells us that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray. That he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal our land. And in this dark hour for the people of El Paso. We do well to pray. Pray for healing. Pray for the families of those that were lost and engine pray for these communities and for our nation as a whole. We also do well in this time to recognize that the greatest source of community in the modern world is faith our nation was built on strong voluntary associations and depends on them more today than ever before from the American founding voluntary associations churches synagogues places of worship and religious education have been at the center of American communities and they are the wellspring of American strength. but as you all in ADF know well. We live in a time where. We've seen people driving religion from the public square and it's even become fashionable for many in the media and popular culture to mock religious beliefs. The freedom of religion was enshrined in the Bill of Rights as our 1st freedom because it was at the center of the American founding. And also because it's the wellspring of order in a free society. Our 1st vice president John Adams. Said and I quote Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other. That's why from early on in this administration President Trump has stood for the freedom of religion and stood with people of faith. tonne as you know well we've taken action to protect the freedom of speech in places of worship we've restored federal enforcement of our nation's conscience laws and taken action to protect the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and health care providers. We've also gone to court to protect the right to religious expression in the public square and the Alliance Defending Freedom has been there every step of the way",

BUT THINK ABOUT IT, WITH NO POLITICAL EXPERIENCE BEAT THE CLINTON DYNASTY, THE BUSH DYNASTY, THE PRESIDENT BARACK bb AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WORKED HARDER AT DEFEATING ME THEN CRICKET HILLARY CLINTON DEAD. HE WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. THE ONLY TIME I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN HIM WORK HARD, WHEN HE CAME TO TRY TO BEAT TRUMP. IT'S TRUE. REMEMBER, HE SAID, REMEMBER, HE SAID, HE WILL NOT BE PRESIDENT. THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL. THEN THEY FIGURE THEY COULD TAKE US OUT A VERY DIFFERENT WAY, VERY DISHONESTLY. WITH THE LYING AND SPYING AND LEAKING.AND WE ARE KICKING THEIR ASS. IN THE DELUSIONAL DEMOCRAT FANTASY I AM NOW SUPPOSED TO BE AFRAID OF SOMEONE CALLED ONE PERCENT JOE. I USED TO CALM ONE PERCENT JOE BECAUSE HE COULD NEVER GET ONE PERCENT OF THE PRIMARIES THAT HE GOT BROUGHT OUT BY OBAMA OUT OF THE TRASH HEAP. BECAME VICE PRESIDENT. BOWIE NOW NAMED HIM VERY SLOW SLEEPY JOE. VERY SLOW. HE'S GOTTEN SLOWER AND SLOWER, I'M AFRAID IF HE GETS A NOMINATION HE WILL BE SO SLOW WE WILL HAVE THE LOWEST RATE OF DEBATES IN HISTORY. AS OPPOSED TO THE HIGHEST RATED DEBATES IN HISTORY AGAINST CRICKET HILLARY. IN FACT, I DON'T EVEN THINK SLEEPY JOE WILL GET IT BUT MANY PEOPLE ARE RUNNING SO IT SO EARLY I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEIR CAMPAIGN. DID YOU HEAR, BETO O'ROURKE, DID YOU HEAR? POOR BETH bbHE'S PATHETIC. HE RAN AGAINST TED CRUZ, TED CRUZ WON. HE SPENT ALMOST $100 MILLION AND TED CRUZ AND I HELPED TED AND WE CAMPAIGNED TOGETHER BUT I USED TO WATCH HIM BUT WHEN HE CAME ONTO THE REALLY BIG STAGE THIS CRAZY STAGE I NOTICED HE WAS FLAILING WITH THE ARMS AND STANDING ON TABLES. HE WAS STANDING ON COUNTERTOPS. I SAID DOES HE EVER STAND ON THE FLOOR AND SPEAK? HE'S WAVING HIS ARMS GOING CRAZY AND I SAID, WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING? WHAT IS HE ON? REMEMBER HE MADE THE STATEMENTS THAT HE WAS BORN FOR THIS. ANYBODY THAT SAYS HE WAS BORN FOR THIS, THEY ARE IN TROUBLE. I USED TO HAVE GUYS COME INTO MY OFFICE, SIR, I'M THE GREATEST SALESMAN. THE TRUTH IS, ANYBODY THAT SAYS THEY'RE GREAT SALESMAN, USUALLY THEY ARE NOT A VERY GOOD SALESMAN. IT'S TRUE. IT'S THE SNEAKY ONES IN THE BACK THAT DON'T TALK. THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT, THEY ARE THE ONES. BUT BETO O'ROURKE, HE IS NASTY. HE SAID HE WAS BORN FOR IT. HE WAS BORN FROM HEAVEN HE CAME DOWN AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, SOME REALLY BAD THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU MADE A TOTAL FOOL OF HIMSELF. HE CAME OUT OF TEXAS, THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS. HE CAME OUT OF TEXAS A VERY HOT POLITICAL PROPERTY. AND HE WENT BACK AS COLD AS YOU CAN BE. HE WAS A NASTY GUY. HE HAD A COUPLE POLICIES THAT DON'T WORK WELL IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. HE WAS AGAINST RELIGION, HE WAS AGAINST YOU HAVING A GUN. AND HE WAS AGAINST OIL. YOU COME FROM TEXAS YOU DON'T LIKE RELIGION, YOU DON'T LIKE OIL AND YOU DON'T HAVE GUNS, THAT'S NOT A GOOD COMBINATION IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. THAT'S NOT GOOD IN MISSISSIPPI EITHER. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOOD ANYWHERE. HE WENT BACK HOME TO TEXAS AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE HEARING ABOUT HIM FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S AMAZING HOW COLBY CAN GET SO QUICKLY.HE WAS A NASTY GUY. OH, ALABAMA. I LOVE ALABAMA. I GRANDMA. IT'S A GREAT PLACE. BUT IN THE GRADE TWISTED AND CORRUPT WORLD OF ADAM SCHIFF, AFTER BEATING THE ENTIRE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT, AND THAT MEANS bbTHEY HAD MESUPPOSEDLY SENT TO MYSELF, LET'S SEE, I'VE GOT A GUY NAMED SLEEPY JOE BIDEN, KIND OF LIKE bbHOW DO I BEAT HIM? HOW DO I BEAT THIS GUY? HE IS SUCH A GREAT bbCLINTON WAS EASY. OBAMA WAS EASY. THE BUSH DYNASTY bbBUT SLEEPYJOE I'M WORRIED ABOUT. RIGHT? SO THEN I SAID TO MYSELF, GEE, I GUESS THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY. LET'S CALL UP UKRAINE FOR HELP. . THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. THESE DISHONEST PEOPLE WILL TAKE THE LAST LITTLE SLIVER IN THE FIRST LITTLE SLIVER AND THEY WILL PUT IT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO DAMNED DISHONEST AND SAY LET'S USE UP UKRAINE FOR HELP. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO SAY. IT WILL SHOW THE LAUGHTER AND THEY WILL SHOW THE SARCASM AND THEY WON'T SHOW THE PHONE BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST DISHONORABLE PEOPLE bbALMOST.IT'S A DISGRACE. BUT WE SAY IT ANYWAY. HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS, THE PEOPLE GET IT. SO THEY HAVE A BRAND-NEW PRESIDENT IN UKRAINE, GOOD GUY BY THE WAY. I'M ON A PHONE AND I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THE PHONE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU CALL THE LEADERS OF COUNTRY MANY PEOPLE LISTEN.I'M ON THE PHONE AND THEY WANT ME TO SAY TO THIS BRAND-NEW PRESIDENT WHO JUST GOT THERE, CALLED TO CONGRATULATE HIM, PLEASE, COULD YOU HELP ME? I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS AND I DIDN'T KNOW HIS NAME UNTIL I LOOKED DOWN THE CARD AND HE'S A NICE GUY AND HOPEFULLY IS GOING TO ROOT OUT CORRUPTION BECAUSE UKRAINE HAS TREMENDOUS CORRUPTION PROBLEMS. AND HOPEFULLY, ONE OF THE REASONS I HELD UP MONEY, VERY IMPORTANT, CORRUPTION. BUT THE OTHER REASON, WHY IS IT GERMANY AND FRANCE IN UK AND ALL THESE EUROPEAN NATIONS bb WHY ARE THEY DOING THINGS THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO? WHY IS IT ALWAYS THE UNITED STATES? SO I MADE THIS CALL, HAD THIS WONDERFUL CALL AND THE TRANSCRIPT PROVES IT WAS PERFECT. IT WAS PERFECT. IT WASN'T LIKED ALMOST, IT WAS PERFECT. IT WAS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE. I MADE IT AT THE BEHEST OF PEOPLE TO SAY COULD YOU CALL AND SAY HELLO? I'M AN HONEST PERSON ANYWAY BUT DO YOU THINK WHEN I'M MAKING A CALL TO A NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY THAT I WOULD SAY SOMETHING IMPROPER WHEN I KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE LISTENING ON THE LINE. MANY PEOPLE. ALL OF THESE PEOPLE, THE SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO, GREAT GUY, HE'S LISTENING. TRANSCRIBERS, FORTUNATELY, YOU HAVE POLICY EXPERTS, JUNIOR AIDS, LOW-LEVEL STAFFERS, PROBABLY APPRENTICE, WHOEVER THE HELL WANTS TO LISTEN, THEY LISTEN. THEY HAVE ME MAKING SOME KIND OF A DEAL WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE AND REMEMBER, THE NEW PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE IS SPEAKING TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PRESIDENT. I GUARANTEE HE'S GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE LISTENING TOO. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. CORRUPT POLITICIAN SHIFT THE ADAM SCHIFF STOOD BEFORE CONGRESS AND STOOD BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MADE UP A CONVERSATION THAT HE SAID I HAD WITH THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT. MANY PEOPLE SAW THAT AND IT WAS TERRIBLE. HE SAID TERRIBLE THINGS. THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE SAID IT WAS A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION. THERE WAS NO PRESSURE. THEY MUST THINK WE ARE NUTS, TO BE HONEST.IT'S ALL A PHONY DEAL THIS WHOLE IMPEACHMENT SCAM TO TRY TO UNDERMINE THE 2020 ELECTION AND DELEGITIMIZE ONE OF THE GREATEST ELECTIONS, MAY BE THE GREATEST. LET'S GIVE GEORGE WASHINGTON CREDIT. EVERYBODY EXPECTED HE WAS GOING TO WIN. MY PHONE CALL, WHICH WAS TOTALLY PERFECT AND APPROPRIATE AND IF YOU WANT TO READ THE TRANSCRIPT, YOU SEE HOW PERFECT IT WAS. BUT THEY DON'T QUIT. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT THE BEHAVIOR OF SLEEPY JOE. SO I QUOTE LET ME ACT LIKE HIM, I GOTTA SPEAK REALLY SLOW THOUGH. I SAID, YOU'RE NOT GETTING A BILLION, I LOOKED AT THEM AND I SAID, I'M LEAVING. IN SIX HOURS. IF THE PROSECUTOR ISN'T FIRED, YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE MONEY. YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE MONEY. HE GOES AT THE END, I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD THESE KIND OF ENERGY. HE SAID WELL, SOME OF IT bHEGOT FIRED. BY THE WAY, HE IS DROPPING LIKE A ROCK. WHEN YOU ARE AT ONE PERCENT, THERE'S ALWAYS A REASON. HE SHOULD BE THERE FAIRLY SOON. AS YOU KNOW, THE UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR THAT BIDEN GOT FIRED AFTER THREATENING TO WITHHOLD I THINK IT WAS $1 BILLION OR SOMETHING. WAS THE PROSECUTOR INVESTIGATING HIS SON'S COMPANY THAT WAS PAYING HUNTER BIDEN, A GUY JUST GOT THROWN OUT OF THE NAVY, HE WAS PAYING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVEN THOUGH WORKING FOR AN ENERGY COMPANY HE HAD NO EXPERIENCE WITH ENERGY. HE KNEW LESS ABOUT IT THEN THIS YOUNG, HOW OLD ARE YOU? SIX. THIS YOUNG BEAUTIFUL PERSON IN FRONT OF ME. SIX. IN THIS YOUNG SIX-YEAR-OLD IS SMARTER, I BASICALLY GO WITH HER. WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT? IT'S CALLED A PAYOFF. BUT THE FAKE NEWS, THEY APOLOGIZE. I WATCHED THIS HORRIBLE GUY, GIVES LOUSY RATINGS, ANDERSON COOPER. THE HATRED BETWEEN HIM AND FREDA YOU GOT FRITO. THAT'S CUOMO. FRITO. I CALL HIM FREDA LIKE FROM THE MOVIE. I WATCHED ANDERSON COOPER AND I WATCH HIM APOLOGIZE FOR EVEN ASKING THE QUESTION TO BIDEN. THE GOOD NEWS IS, BIDEN DIDN'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT WHAT THE HELL HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. REMEMBER BIDEN SAID, I DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE. HE NEVER SPOKE TO HIS SON ABOUT GETTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. NUMBER HE NEVER SPOKE TO bbWE ARE DEALING WITH LIFE. YOU NEVER SPOKE TO THEM. UNFORTUNATELY THE NEXT DAY, YOU KNOW THE WORLD OF THE INTERNET, AND THE WORLD OF SMART PEOPLE, THAT'S WHERE bbTHAT'S WHY BETO ISN'T SMART, HE TOLD OUR GREAT FIRST LADY TONIGHT, WHO PEOPLE LOVE. WHEN HE QUIT HE QUIT LIKE A DOG I SAID YOU SEE PEOPLE THINK THIS IS EASY, THIS ISN'T EASY. IT JUST WORKED OUT THAT WAY BUT BIDEN SAID, I NEVER MET THE PEOPLE, NEVER MET THE GENTLEMAN, UNFORTUNATELY IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS A PICTURE CAME OUT WHERE THEY ARE PLAYING GOLF TOGETHER. BUT HE NEVER MET. NOW YOU ASK HIM, WE PLAYED A ROUND OF GOLF WE WERE TOGETHER FOR THREE HOURS, AND NEVER MENTION THE FACT THEY ARE PAYING MY SON MILLIONS. CRAZY ANDERSON COOPER, LOUSY RATINGS. CNN, THE WORST, THE WORST. THE LIGHT JUST WENT OFF, YOU SEE! THE LIGHT WAS ON THEY JUST TURN IT OFF. THEY DON'T LIKE IT. IT'S TOUGH, FAKE CNN I TRIED NOT TO DO THAT BECAUSE I SEE THEIR LIGHT ON.WHEN LIGHT GOES ON THAT MEANS bbBUT INALL FAIRNESS, THE PICTA IS A BROADCAST, VERY FEW PEOPLE bb HERE'S THE THING, YOU HAVE THE GUY UP THERE SAYING THAT THEY ARE FAKE THAT THEY ARE NO GOOD. THAT THEY ARE LIARS AND CHEATERS. THAT THEY ARE PHONIES. IT'S HARD TO BE BROADCASTING THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NETWORK THAT HAS YOU ON. WE UNDERSTAND. THE LIGHTS OFF. AND THEN REMEMBER THIS, bbWASSO NICE, PRIOR TO RUNNING TO FOR POLITICS HE WAS SO NICE TO ME. I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM. HE'S A WEAK PERSON. BUT THEY ARE ALL WEEK. LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE NEED HONESTY WITH OUR MEDIA. WE NEED HONESTY. BECAUSE THE NEW YORK TIMES, THE WASHINGTON POST, AND BY THE WAY, YOU PROBABLY READ IT, WE THREW THEM OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE WE DON'T SHOW THEM ANYMORE. IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO GO WE THREW THEM OUT. THEY CAME INTO MY OFFICE AND I GOT TO IT BACK TO THE SKY, WHERE IS HUNTER? WHERE IS HUNTER? HE CAME OUT AND DID THE MORNING SHOW. THAT WAS THE LAST LEASING OF HUNTER. THAT WASN'T GOOD. THE MORNING OF HIS FATHER'S VERY BAD DEBATE. BEFORE I SAY THE FINAL THING ON HUNTER AND THEN WE PUT HIM TO REST FOR A WHILE, WE GET RID OF THE WASHINGTON POST AND THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES WE GET RID OF THEM. WE DON'T HAVE THEM IN THE WHITE HOUSE. PEOPLE CAN GO OUT AND BUY IT BUT WE DON'T HAVE IT. WE USED TO HAVE THEM STACKED UP. I GO IN AND SEE A MEETING WITH MY PEOPLE AND THEY ARE SOUTH KOREA OR SOMEBODY AND I GO IN AND GOING TO THESE OFFICES, I WOULD LOSE CLEC 10 OR 15 OF THEM PACKED ALL OVER THE PLACE. THE WASHINGTON POST, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHOSE WORKS. ONE DAY IT'S TIMES, ONE DAY IT'S SUPPOSED. THEY TAP EACH OTHER IS SO BAD, SO PHONY, IN MY OPINION, IT'S VIRTUALLY CORRUPT. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT. YOU NEVER HAVE A GOOD STORY. EVEN WHEN WE GOT ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI. LIKE HE WAS A RELIGIOUS PLAQUE. WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? IF OBAMA WOULD HAVE DONE IT. THIS GUY BUILT ISIS. THE CALIPHATE. IT WAS THE SIZE PHYSICALLY OF OHIO THE STATE OF OHIO THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO. THAT'S A LOT OF LAND. 7 MILLION PEOPLE AND THEY THE ONES THE ORANGE JUMPSUITS I CALLED ONE OF THE PARENTS AFTER WE DID THIS AND I TALKED TO THEM AND THEY WERE, HOW CAN YOU BE HAPPY? THEY WERE SO THRILLED THAT WE GOT THIS ANIMAL. THEY WERE SO THRILLED. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO IT BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT. STORY WAS A MASSIVE STORY THAT WAS THE BIGGEST MAYBE THE BIGGEST ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVER. BIGGER THAN ANYTHING. THAT STORY DISAPPEARED SO FAST. GONE. THAT'S OKAY I DIDN'T DO IT FOR THE STORY. I DID IT BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT IF I WERE A DEMOCRAT. IF I WERE A DEMOCRAT, THEY'D BE TALKING ABOUT THAT STORY FOR WEEKS. WITH ME, THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO COME OF THE ACTUALLY PLAYED IT DOWN. AND I'M HAPPY ABOUT THIS, CONAN THE DOG GOT MORE PUBLICITY THAN ME AND I'M VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT. CONAN THE INCREDIBLE. HE IS COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN A FEW WEEKS. DID YOU EVER SEE A STORY DISAPPEARED SO FAST? IF OBAMA HAD THAT STORY, THAT THEY WOULD BE GOING ON FOR ANOTHER SEVEN MONTHS. THEY BE TALKING ABOUT HIS BRAVERY. 142 JUDGES bbTHEY ALWAYS SAY, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THE PRESIDENT CAN DO IS FEDERAL JUDGES. WE GOT TWO SUPREME COURT'S. GREAT ONES. GORSUCH AND KAVANAUGH, GREAT JUDGES. DID YOU EVER SEE ANY HUMAN BEING TREATED WORSE THAN NOW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH? DID ANYBODY EVER? DID ANY HUMAN BEING BY THESE PEOPLE THESE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. JUST TO FINISH, HUNTER THEN GOES TO CHINA, NOW I'M DEALING WITH CHINA RIGHT NOW, THEY DON'T LIKE ME TOO MUCH. THEY DREAM ABOUT THE DAY WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE, AND WOULD THEY LIKE TO HAVE, HOW ABOUT THIS? YOU GET THIS SON WITH ZERO EXPERIENCE OF INVESTING GIVEN $1.5 BILLION TO INVEST, HE MAKES MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE BIGGEST GUYS AND WALL STREET GET IT, HE WALKS OUT WITH $1.5 BILLION AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER PLACES ALSO I UNDERSTAND, FOLKS, IT'S DISGRACEFUL THAT THE PRESS DOESN'T COVER IT FOR WHAT IT IS. IT'S A PAYOFF. AND HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE SLEEPY JOE WITH THIS SON GETTING ALL THIS MONEY FROM CHINA BECOME PRESIDENT AND TAKE OVER THE CHINA DEAL. THEY ARE NOT LIKING ME. THEY HAD THE WORST YEAR THEY'VE HAD IN 57 YEARS. THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS BROKEN UP LIKE SCRAMBLED EGGS. AND THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL BECAUSE THOSE TARIFFS ARE GIVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BILLIONS NOW, BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND YOU KNOW WE ARE DOING WITH SOME OF IT? JUST A SMALL PORTION BUT 100% TAKING CARE OF OUR FARMERS GOT $16 BILLION LAST YEAR. AND $12 BILLION THIS YEAR. BECAUSE THEY TARGETED OUR FARMERS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE FARMERS LOG TRUMP AND THE TRUE FARMERS LOVE TROUT.THEY TARGETED THEM AND BROUGHT THE 16 DOLLARS DOWN TO PRACTICALLY NOTHING AND THEY THOUGHT THE FARMERS WOULD SAY, WE DON'T LIKE TRUMP, THEY DID THE OPPOSITE, THEY SAID WE KNOW HE'S DOING THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE WE BEEN RIPPED OFF FOR SO MANY YEARS. I SAID TO SECRETARY ABOUT THE AGRICULTURE, I SAID HOW MUCH DID THEY SPEND BUYING OUR CORN AND SOYBEANS AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS? HE SAID, SIR, $16 BILLION. I SAID GOOD, I WILL MAKE IT UP AND WE WILL HAVE A LOT LEFT OVER. WE WILL HAVE PRETTY SOON OVER $100 BILLION IN MONEY PAID INTO THE UNITED STATES TREASURY BY A COUNTRY THAT NEVER GAVE US $0.10. THEY ONLY TOOK. WHEN I SAID TO THE FARMERS, WE ARE GOING TO SEND YOU $16 BILLION AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN SPLIT IN THE $12 MILLION THE YEAR BEFORE. THINK ABOUT THAT, $28 BILLION, AS IT COMPLEMENTS OF CHINA. AND WE HAD A LOT LEFT OVER, NOT BAD. NOT BAD. YOU THINK OBAMA WOULD DO THAT? I DON'T THINK SO. YOU THINK HILLARY DID WOULD DO THAT? I DON'T THINK SO. YOU THINK SLEEPY JOE WOULD DO THAT? I DON'T THINK SO. HE WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ON TUESDAY THE PROUD PEOPLE OF MISSISSIPPI WILL SEND DEMOCRATS A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THIS REASON AS WELL AS THE FACT YOU GOT A GREAT GENTLEMAN IN YOUR MIDST. BUT YOU HAVE TO REJECT THEIR EXTREMISM AND THEIR SOCIALISM AND THEIR CORRUPTION THAT CORRUPT, ADAM SCHIFF IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN. WHEN HE MADE THE PHONY SPEECH, WHAT HE MADE UP HIS BARELY HORRIBLE SPEECH AND SAID THAT I SAID IT. I SAID I'M GOING TO SUE HIM, THEY SAID SURE, I'M SORRY CAN'T. YOU GOT TOTAL IMMUNITY BECAUSE HE MADE IT IN CONGRESS. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS, AT LEAST WE HAVE A FORUM. WE HAVE A PLACE WE CAN TALK SO EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON. A BUNCH OF PHONY PEOPLE BUT THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO SEND THE SIGNAL AND WHY YOU HAVE TO MAKE bb HE'S A GREAT GUY TOO. ALL I KNOW IS HE IS LOVED AND RESPECTED BY YOUR CURRENT GOVERNOR. BECAUSE PHIL IS SOME PIECE OF WORK. PHIL IS SO CONFIDENT, I WANTED PHIL TO RUN FOR CERTAIN OFFICES AND I WANTED HIM TO DO bbI TRIED TO GET HIM. SOME GUYS bbHE SAID NO SIR I'VE BEEN DOING THIS MY WHOLE LIFE I LOVE THE PEOPLE. HE BUILT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AFRICAN-AMERICAN MUSEUM. HE IS THE GREATEST. HE BUILT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL bb HE'S GOT CONFIDENCE. HE SAID, NO, SIR, I'VE BEEN DOING IT I DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO THIS. MOST PEOPLE ARE SO INSECURE, THEY KEEP GOING AND GOING AND GOING, bb REALLY A CHAMPION FOR MISSISSIPPI VALUES AND TATE HELP CUP YOUR TAXES OVER 50 TIMES INCLUDING THE LARGEST TAX CUT IN MISSISSIPPI HISTORY. TATE, PRO-WORKER, PRO-JOBS, PRO-FAMILIES, PRO-LIFE. TATE IS A TRUE LEADER IN THE FIGHT TO PROTECT THE UNBORN. THE OTHER SIDE IS NOT. TATE TO REEVES WILL SUPPORT OUR POLICE, UPLOAD SANCTUARY CLIQUES WHO LOVE OUR POLICE. I LOVE OUR POLICE. WE LOVE OUR POLICE. OPPOSE SANCTUARY CITIES, WHICH IS JUST TERRIBLE. THEY ARE TERRIBLE. AND TATE WILL ALWAYS DEFEND YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. TATE IS RUNNING AGAINST A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT NAMED JIM HOOD. ALL I KNOW ABOUT JIM HOOD IS HE FOUGHT VERY HARD TO ELECT CRICKET HILLARY CLINTON AND BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA. HE WANTED OBAMA TO WIN SO BADLY AND THEN HE WANTED HILLARY TO WIN AND THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF GUY WE NEED HERE, NOT MISSISSIPPI. HE SUPPORTED BY EXTREME LEFTISTS LIKE STACEY ABRAMS, WHO BY THE WAY WENT DOWN TO DEFEAT IN FRONT OF A TERRIFIC GENTLEMAN FROM THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA, BRIAN KEMP. AND THEY CAME IN WITH, THEY BROUGHT THEM ALL. THEY HAD PRESIDENT OBAMA, THEY HAD MICHELLE OBAMA, THEY HAD OPRAH WINFREY, AND ALL HE HAD WAS bbAND WE WON. VERY EASILY. BUT STACEY ABRAMS WANT TO GIVE ILLEGAL ALIENS THE RIGHT TO VOTE. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? SOME OF THESE PEOPLE THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM EDUCATION THEY WANT TO GIVE HIM THIS, THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM FREE HEALTHCARE THEY WANT TO GET THESE PEOPLE THAT COME INTO OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY MORE ADVANTAGES THAN OUR OWN CITIZENS HAVE. MORE ADVANTAGES THAN OUR OWN MILITARY HAVE. JIM HOOD WANTS TO RAISE THE TAXES. HE SUPPORTS TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABORTION PROVIDERS. HE SUPPORTS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION THE WHOLE BENEFITS. AND HE OPPOSED OUR TRAVEL BAN WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE RUN IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT TO KEEP TERRORISTS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. JIM HOOD WENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS AND OPPOSED YOUR RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE. IF YOU DON'T WANT A FAR LEFT DEMOCRAT RUNNING MISSISSIPPI, WAIT A MINUTE, HOW IS THIS GUY bbI CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS A COMPETITIVE RACE. IT'S EMBARRASSING. I'M TALKING MISSISSIPPI. I'M TALKING TO MISSISSIPPI. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I WILL THINK THAT HE'S GOING TO BE THE RIGHT GUY. I THINK THE GUY THAT YOU WANT IS TATE REEVES. HE'S GONNA BE FANTASTIC. HE WILL BE A GREAT GREAT GOVERNOR. TATE, COME ON UP. THANK YOU TATE, TUESDAY GO OUT AND BUT FOR TATE, HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN. DON'T KID YOURSELF, YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT IS UNDER ATTACK. THAT WITH HIM, IT'S UNDER ATTACK. WE ARE ALSO JOINED TONIGHT BY A MAN WHO IS TRULY I'VE SAID A LOT, HE HAS BEEN A GREAT GOVERNOR AND HE LOVES YOUR STATE AND HE LOVES THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT STATE, GOVERNOR PHIL BRIAN, WHERE IS PHIL? COME UP PHIL. COME UP PHIL. THANK YOU PHIL. THANK YOU MY PHIL. WHAT A GREAT JOB. TO CONTINUE THAT WHOLE THING GOING FORWARD. ANOTHER MAN WHO IS A WARRIOR A FRIEND OF MINE. WHENEVER THERE IS A PROBLEM HE IS THERE HE IS ALWAYS THERE HE WILL BE RIGHT AT THE FRONT, HE IS TOUGH, SMART, BRILLIANT ACTUALLY. AND HE LOVES THIS STATE AND HE LOVES YOU PEOPLE. SENATOR ROGER WICKER. ROGER. THANK YOU ROGER. SOMEBODY I WILL CALL HER UP BECAUSE BELIEVE IT OR NOT SHE'S RUNNING WITH ME. SHE JUST RAN I SAID SIDNEY YOU JUST RAN YOU JUST WON. SHE SAID NO I HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN. SHE'S RUNNING IN 2020. I THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE LIKE SIX YEARS I SAID CINDY, IT'S ONLY LIKE A YEAR. CINDY HYDE SMITH, SHE'S INCREDIBLE. SHE'S TOUGH AND SMART AND STRONG AND SHE IS WITH US ALL THE WAY. CINDY HYDE SMITH. IS THIS GUY INCREDIBLE OR WHAT? GREAT JOB. FANTASTIC WOMAN. ALSO WITH US TWO TERRIFIC FRIENDS OF MINE. MIKE ROGER AND LIKE CINDY HYDE SMITH WHO'S LIKE ALL OF THEM. IN TATE HE'S GIVEN ME RIGHT THERE WITH US. ALL FIGHTING TOGETHER. TWO INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. TRENT KELLY, MICHAEL INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. YOUR NEXT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR YOUR NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL LYNN FITCH. YOUR NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE MICHAEL WATSON. GREAT PEOPLE. YOUR NEXT STATE TREASURER DAVID McRAE. STATE AUDITOR SHED WHITE. AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER ANDREW GIBSON. INSURANCE COMMISSIONER MIKE CHANEY AND FORMER GOVERNOR A MAN THAT NOBODY'S EVER HEARD OF IN THIS ROOM. BUT THE TRUTH IS, HE'S A LEGEND IN POLITICS AND A GREAT GUY HE'S A GREAT GUY. HALEY BARBOUR. GREAT GUY. WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE HERE WE ARE THE HOTTEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, WE CREATED OVER 6.7 MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION. THAT I WOULD CREATE 6.7 NEW JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION THESE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GONE CRAZY. THEY WOULD'VE SAID HORRIBLE THINGS. THEY WOULD'VE SAID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED THE LOWEST RATE IN OVER 51 YEARS. SOON TO BE HISTORIC. AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT JUST DROPPED TO THE LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED HISTORIC. REALLY UNIMPORTANT TO ME. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE LOOKED AT 55,000 MISSISSIPPI RESIDENTS OUT OF POVERTY. HOURLY EARNINGS ARE UP NINE PERCENT IN MISSISSIPPI SINCE THE ELECTION. UNDER THE PREVIOUS TWO ADMINISTRATIONS WE LOST 60,000 FACTORIES IN OUR COUNTRY UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION WE'VE ALREADY ADDED NEARLY 10,000 NEW FACTORIES AND MANY MORE ARE COMING IN. TO GET RELIEF TO WORKING FAMILIES WE PASSED MASSIVE TAX CUTS ON AVERAGE $2000-$2500 PER FAMILY. BRINGING ALMOST $1 TRILLION BACK HOME TO OUR IT SHOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING BIG COMPANIES CAN GET THEIR MONEY BACK. BOTH BUREAUCRATICALLY AND FROM A TAX STANDPOINT. THEY BROUGHT BACK ALMOST $1 TRILLION BECAUSE OF US. ALL PUT TO WORK. WE/THE LARGEST NUMBER IN HISTORY OF TOP REGULATIONS AND WE ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY WE ARE NOW THE NUMBER ONE REDUCER OF ENERGY BY FAR ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. FOR DECADES USED CORRUPT POLITICIANS TAKE MONEY FROM LOBBYISTS TO IMPOSE CATASTROPHIC TRADE VIEW. MISSISSIPPI LOST 40% OF ALL MANUFACTURING JOBS AFTER THE TWIN DISASTERS OF NAFTA AND CHINA'S ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, TWO OF THE WORST DEALS EVER MADE BY OUR COUNTRY. 100,000 MISSISSIPPI JOBS WERE WIPED AWAY JUST LIKE THAT. THAT'S A BIG PRICE TO PAY FOR WASHINGTON'S DISLOYALTY TO THE AMERICAN WORKER. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.IT WAS DISLOYALTY STUPIDITY. CORRUPTION. LOTS OF REASONS. NOW YOU FINALLY HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO'S LOYAL TO YOU AND I AM. I'M A FIGHTER FOR YOUR JOBS, YOUR WAGES, YOUR FACTORIES YOUR FAMILIES AND DIGNITY WE ARE STOPPING CHINA FROM RIPPING US OFF. WE ARE STOPPING ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE LOSE OUR MONEY, WE LOSE OUR WEALTH WE LOSE OUR JOBS WE CLOSE UP FACTORIES, THAT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE. IT'S REVERSED. WE WERE THE SUCKER COUNTRY FOR YEARS AND YEARS BUT WE ARE NOT THE SUCKER COUNTRY ANYMORE AND THEY ALL KNOW IT. WE ARE REPLACING NAFTA AND THAT WAS A DISASTER, NAFTA. WITH THE BRAND-NEW U.S. MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT OF NANCY PELOSI WILL EVER PUT IT UP TO A VOTE. WHICH IS QUESTIONABLE. NERVOUS NANCY. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY VICTORY. SHE'S VERY BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS, HAVING FUN. THE US MCA WOULD BE A MASSIVE VICTORY FOR MISSISSIPPI FARMERS AND ALSO INCLUDES POWERFUL PROJECTIONS FOR MISSISSIPPI AUTOWORKERS MANUFACTURERS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. THE GREAT AGREEMENT. ABOUT TIME WE GOT RID OF NAFTA. THE DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS NEED TO STOP THEIR MADNESS AND PASS THE US MCA RIGHT NOW. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE U.S. OIL INDUSTRY. UNDER OUR POLICIES TOYOTA HAS JUST ANNOUNCED A $170 MILLION INVESTMENT IN MISSISSIPPI bb DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THIS PLACE? BLUE SPRINGS. BEFORE MY ELECTION OUR LEADERS USED THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS AS A PIGGYBACK TO FUND THEIR DELUSIONAL GLOBAL PRODUCTS ALL OVER THE WORLD. WE TAKE CARE OF OTHER COUNTRIES BUT WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN. THEY KNOWINGLY DECIMATED AMERICAN MANUFACTURING TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THEY DEPLOYED OUR MILITARY TO PROTECT, IMMENSELY WEALTHY NATIONS SUBSIDIZING THEIR WELFARE STATES WITH YOUR MONEY I ASK THOSE WEALTHY NATIONS NOW, AND RESPECTFULLY THE OTHER DAY SAID TO THE KING OF SAUDI ARABIA. WE WILL HELP YOU BUT YOU GOT TO PAY. HE WAS GREAT BUT NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED BEFORE. WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT'S BEN'S BILLIONS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BUT WE SAID YOU ARE VERY WEALTHY YOU HAVE TO PAY. THAT'S TRUE WITH MANY COUNTRIES BY THE WAY. THEY NEVER RESPECTED US THEY COULD NEVER BELIEVE IT. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN. HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE COULDN'T REALLY ANSWER IT. BECAUSE HOW THE HELL DID THIS HAPPEN. ASK CHINA HOW MANY COUNTRIES ARE YOU PROTECTING? PRESIDENT XI. THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE WHAT A STUPID QUESTION. HOW MANY COUNTRIES YOU PROTECTING PRESIDENT PUTIN. HE LOOKS AND HE GOES, RUSSIA. WE ARE PROTECTING AT LEAST 94. THERE ARE SO MANY THEY CAME AND TOLD ME. I BEEN TRYING TO GET AN ANSWER FOR FOUR MONTHS. IT'S ALL BEAUTIFUL THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING. THE SAME POLITICIANS FOR PRECIOUS AMERICAN BLOOD AND TREASURE INTO THE SANDS OF THE MIDDLE EAST. OUR FAILED RULING CLASS WAS THEIR RIGHT TO RULE OVER YOU TO TAKE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR JOBS AND REDISTRIBUTE YOUR WEALTH ALL OF THE GLOBE WHEREVER THEY WANTED IT BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT. OUT LIKE THAT. THE GREAT SELLOUT HAS ENDED AND IT ENDED IT ENDED TODAY I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE. AFTER YEARS OF BUILDING UP FOREIGN NATIONS WE ARE FINALLY BUILDING UP OUR NATION. WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. OUR POLICY OF NEVER ENDING WAR. THE REGIME CHANGE IN NATIONBUILDING BY THE CLEAR PURSUIT OF AMERICAN INTEREST. IT'S THE JOB OF ALL MILITARY TO PROTECT OUR SECURITY NOT TO BE THE POLICEMAN OF THE WORLD PROVING THE WISDOM OF THIS APPROACH WE RECENTLY SECURED A PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE IN NORTHERN SYRIA WITHOUT SPILLING ONE DROP OF AMERICAN bI HAVETO BE HONEST ONE SOLDIER STEPPED ON A NAIL. IT'S TRUE. I SAID DON'T TELL THE PRESS THAT BECAUSE I SAID DON'T MENTION IT PLEASE. THEY ALWAYS LIKE TO IMAGINE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. TAKE IT A LITTLE LOW-KEY. NOT A DROP OF BLOOD. AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DEFEND DAVID FIGHTING FOR A THOUSAND YEARS. BUT WE DID KEEP THE OIL IF YOU DON'T MIND, WE KEPT THE OIL. WE WILL HELP OUT OURSELVES IF THAT'S OKAY. THEN THEY DEMANDED AMERICAN CITIZENS EXCEPT UNLIMITED MIGRATION FROM THOSE TEAR AFFLICTED NATIONS AND REGIONS. I DON'T THINK SO. WE DID NOT FIGHT THEM OVER THERE. ONLY TO INVITE THEM OVER HERE. WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES BY ADMINISTRATION RESTRICTED MIGRATION FROM TERROR PRONE NATIONS AND IMPLEMENTED THE TOUGHEST EVER VETTING PROCEDURES. NO ISSUE HAS EVER BEEN SO HORRIBLY DISCARDED BY A PARTY AS THAT ISSUE BY THE DEMOCRATS. THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS, WHICH MEAN CRIME. THEY WANT TO SANCTUARY CITIES, WHICH MEANS CRIMES AND DRUGS AND bbAFTER PLEADING THE MIDDLE-CLASS DRIVE, DEMOCRATS THROUGH OPEN OUR BORDERS TO THE WORLD FLOODING OUR COMMUNITIES WITH POISONOUS DRUGS AND CRIMINAL CARTELS. PUBLICANS BELIEVE IN STRONG BORDERS AND SAFE COMMUNITIES. WE ARE NOW BUILDING A WALL. YOU THINK THAT'S EASY, THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T WANT THAT, I GOT MONEY FOR EVERYTHING BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE WALL ABOUT $0.10. NOT $0.10. BUT WE GAVE THE MILITARY A LOT OF MONEY AND WE TOOK IT FROM THE MILITARY AND WE TOOK IT FROM YOU WE TOOK IT FROM THERE WE HAD TO GO TO COURT IN ALL THE SUDDEN WE STARTED WINNING CASES. THE WORLD IS GOING UP RAPIDLY. IT'S GOING UP RAPIDLY THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS WORLD. EVERYTHING THEY WANTED TO THEY WENT TO THE BORDER PATROL INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THEY SAID GIVE ME THE SPECIFICATION. THEY SAID WE WOULD LIKE STEEL BUT WE WOULD ALSO LIKE CAN'T TAKE. I SAID WHICH ONE YOU WANT? I DID ALL THREE. BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT FORM. WE'VE GOT IT ALL. WE ALSO NEED SEE-THROUGH SERVE. IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE WHAT WE ARE DOING BUT WE SHOULD HAVE ANYWHERE FROM 400 TO ALMOST 500 MILES OF WALL BUILT BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR. IN ALL THE RIGHT AREAS. IN ALL THE RIGHT AREAS. IT WAS A TOUGH ONE. AND THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IS BUILDING THEIR HEARTS OUT. THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. WE BELIEVE IN KEEPING TERRORIST CRIMINALS AND DRUG DEALERS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER, ILLEGAL CROSSINGS HAVE DROPPED 60% SINCE MAY AND WE ARE FASTER THAN EVER SECURING THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND SOON IT WILL BE WHEN THE WALL IS COMPLETED, SECURED LIKE IT'S NEVER BEEN BEFORE. AND I WANT TO THANK THE COUNTRY OF MEXICO, THEY RIGHT NOW HAVE 27,000 SOLDIERS ON OUR BORDERS AND 27,000, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? THEY ARE KEEPING PEOPLE OUT AND I WANT TO THINK THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO IS AN EXCELLENT PERSON, GREAT MAN. AND WE APPRECIATE IT AND THE REASON IS THAT THE DEMOCRATS WON'T EVEN APPROVE THINGS CALLED LOOPHOLES. LOOPHOLES, THAT'S A HORRIBLE NAME, THAT MEANS IT'S A LOOPHOLE THAT MEANS YOU CAN COME IN ILLEGALLY AND LOTS OF THINGS, CATCH AND RELEASE. YOU CATCH, AND YOU GOT TO RELEASE THEM. BY LAW YOU HAVE TO RELEASE THEM. THEY WILL ARREST THE BORDER PATROL AGENT IF THEY DON'T b BUT WE COULD END THIS IN 15 MINUTES BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT. THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT. THEY ARE OBSTRUCTION, POLLUTERS AND WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO GO WITH TATE REESE. TATE IS GOING TO SEND A BIG SIGNAL BY THE WAY. IT'S GREAT FOR YOU, HE'S GONNA BE A GREAT GOVERNOR IT ALSO SENDS A BIG SIGNAL TO THESE RADICAL LEFT CRAZY DEMOCRATS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT TATE WINS. VERY IMPORTANT. WE ARE ALSO FIGHTING DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES WITH THE HELP OF STATES LIKE MISSISSIPPI, WHICH HAS BANNED SANCTUARY CITIES BECAUSE PHIL BRIAN SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THEM AND ROGER WICKER SAYS WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THEM. AND CINDY SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THEM. DEMOCRATS, SANCTUARY CITIES, FORCE THE RELEASE OF DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS ONTO OUR SPACE. IF YOU WANT A GOVERNOR WHO WILL STAND PROUDLY WITH THE HEROES OF I.C.E. I WOULD WANT THEIR JOB. MS 13 THEY WALK RIGHT INTO THOSE NESTS. THEY START SWINGING YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT. I SAID, BETTER YOU THAN ME, WHO WOULD DO GOOD? THAT GUY WOULD DO GOOD, MOST OF YOU WOULDN'T DO SO GOOD BACK THESE GUYS ARE TOUGH GUYS AND THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY. WHO WOULD DO IT? THEY ARE MOVING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM MS 13 THESE GANGS ARE THE WORST PEOPLE. THESE PEOPLE THESE ARE NOT HUMAN BEINGS. I SAID THAT ONCE BEFORE THIS CRAZY NANCY PELOSI SAID HOW DARE YOU SAY THEY ARE NOT bb HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THEM? THEY SLICED PEOPLE UP WITH A KNIFE BECAUSE IT'S MORE PAINFUL THAN USING A GUN. THEN I HAVE TO DEFEND MYSELF WHEN I SAY THEY ARE ANIMALS BUT I NEVER CHANGED I DIDN'T SAY I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE, I LIKE TO APOLOGIZE CRAZY NANCY. YOU LOOK AT HER DISTRICT IN SAN FRANCISCO, SHE SPENDING ALL HER TIME ON THIS CRAP FOR THIS IMPEACHMENT STUFF. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE GREAT CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. IT'S THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF TENTS AND DRUGS AND NEEDLES AND EVERYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE FLOATING IN THE STREETS IN THE BEST NEIGHBORHOODS, NANCY PELOSI, GO HOME AND FIX HER DISTRICT NANCY. GO HOME AND FIX HER DISTRICT. GO HOME AND FIX HER DISTRICT. IF YOU WANT A GOVERNOR WHO WILL STAND PROUDLY WITH THE HEROES OF I.C.E. AND BORDER PATROL VOTE FOR TATE REEVES. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME. THE DEMOCRATS HEALTHCARE AGENDA WOULD HELP OBLITERATE MEDICARE. I WILL ALWAYS PROTECT MEDICARE FOR OUR SENIORS. WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. ALWAYS. WE WILL ALWAYS. VIRTUALLY EVERY DEMOCRAT ALSO NOW SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION. RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB. RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA EXECUTED A BABY, REMEMBER THAT WHOLE THING? AFTER BIRTH. AFTER BIRTH. SOME PEOPLE NEVER HEARD OF IT. HE SAID THE BABY IS BORN AND THEN HE STARTS TALKING TO THE MOTHER. NOBODY EVER HEARD OF THAT. THAT'S WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTIONS, SOCIALISM AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER THE AMERICAN FAMILY. THE AMERICAN DREAM. NOBODY HAS DONE MORE FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY THEN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND ALSO THE PARTY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. PEOPLE FORGET. ABRAHAM LINCOLN, HONEST ABE. WE CREATED OPPORTUNITIES SO INCREDIBLE, SO SUCCESSFUL. INCLUDING 100 NEW OPPORTUNITIES ZONES RIGHT NOW IN MISSISSIPPI WHERE MONEY IS NOW FLOWING INTO BUILD AND FIX AND TIM SCOTT, I GIVE HIM SO MUCH CREDIT FROM THE GREAT STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. WE PASS THE VA CHOICE NBA ACCOUNTABILITY OF OUR GREAT BETTERS. VA CHOICE. OUR VETERANS ARE WAITING ON LINES DAYS AND WEEKS SOMETIMES. NOW THEY CAN GO OUT AND GET A DOCTOR, WE PAY THE BILL AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT SIX WEEKS, FOUR WEEKS, TWO WEEKS WE HAVE PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE THEY WERE VERY SICK. BY THE TIME THEY SAW THE DOCTOR, THEY WERE TERMINALLY ILL. NOW THEY GO ON AND THEY GO OUTSIDE AND THEY FIND A DOCTOR. WE TAKE CARE OF OUR GREAT VETERANS. TO PROTECT AMERICAN SECURITY I WOULD WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE HORRIBLE ONE CENTERED AROUND NUCLEAR TEARFUL DEAL. NOTHING EASY BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME I RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL THAT OPEN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. FOR YEARS YOU WATCHED AS POLITICIANS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA, NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF MISSISSIPPI. THE NEXT STEP TO VICTORY BEGINS TUESDAY RIGHT HERE IN YOUR GREAT STATE WITH YOUR SUPPORT. WE WILL SHOW THE CORRUPT DEMOCRATS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT EVER GOING TO BACK DOWN FROM PERHAPS THE GREATEST VICTORY IN POLITICAL HISTORY. TODAY WITH THE NEW STOCK MARKET AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH AND WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING IF WE DIDN'T WIN THIS ELECTION, THAT STOCK MARKET WOULD BE AND ONE HALF IT WAS HEADED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IT WAS GOING TO FAIL. IF THEY EVER DO ANYTHING BAD TO US IF THEY EVER SUCCEED IN THEIR WILDEST DREAM, WHICH WE WILL NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN. THAT STOCK MARKET WILL CRASH LIKE YOU NEVER SEEN A CRASH BEFORE. AND YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY WITH YOUR 401 LIKE YOU ARE NOW. BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THE LEADERSHIP THEY HAVE NO CLUE. VERY VICIOUS PEOPLE. ACTUALLY THEY ARE SORT OF MENTALLY VIOLENCE PEOPLE. BUT WE'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL. IT ALWAYS HELPS WHEN YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG. I ALWAYS SAY, HOW YOU IMPEACH A PRESIDENT WHO DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG? WE ARE GOING TO SEND A SIGNAL BY SENDING IT A TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR TO JACKSON. ON TUESDAY YOU GET OUT AND YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE AND YOU GOING TO GIVE UP WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP YOU WILL LEAVE WORK MAY BE A LITTLE EARLY OR GET THERE A LITTLE LATE TELL YOUR BOSS I SAID IT WAS OKAY. I WILL GIVE YOU A PARDON IF I HAVE TO. I WILL GIVE YOU A ONE HOUR PARDON. WITH YOUR HELP WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR GREAT CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK. TOGETHER WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR SAFE SAYING UNLAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION AND YOU HAVE GREAT CONGRESSMEN HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU, I APPRECIATE IT FELLOW WARRIORS.YOU ARE WARRIORS.

WE DO. MAYBE HE WILL GET BETTER. WE'LL SEE. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. MAYBE HE WILL GET BETTER. JUST WANT TO BE FAIR. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT. WE WILL ENACT TRADE DEALS THE RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS, PROBABLY STABBED WITH THOSE BEAUTIFUL WORDS MADE IN THE USA, MADE IN AMERICA, WE WILL RECEIVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE INVITING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT. WITHIN TEN YEARS. IT WILL BE OVER. WHEN THEY COME ABOUT, POINTED IN THE AIDS EPIDEMIC, IT'S FUNDED. NOBODY KNEW WHO IT COULD THAT BUT WE ARE DOING IT. WE'LL HAVE IT ENDED IN AMERICA THE AIDS AND THE DEBT EPIDEMIC WILL BE ENDED IN TEN YEARS. WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT. PREVIOUS BEACH AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.

         "I WANT TO THANK YOU NORTH CAROLINA WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I AM THRILLED TO BE BACK IN THE GREAT CITY OF CHARLOTTE. WERE BY THE WAY WE ARE HAVING OUR CONVENTION, I GUESS YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT? WHERE THOUSANDS OF HARDWORKING AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO LOVE OUR COUNTRY SHARES OUR VALUES, RESPECT OUR LAWS, AND ALWAYS PUT AMERICA FIRST. FEW EIGHT MONTHS FROM NOW, WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT THE RADICAL SOCIALISTS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE GREAT STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA AND ALLIANCE AT LANDSLIDE. WE WANT IT WE WENT LAST TIME, WE WILL WIN THIS TIME. AND YOU KNOW, ERIC AND LAURA NAMED THEIR DAUGHTER. YOU KNOW WHAT HER NAME IS? CAROLINA. HER LAME IS CAROLINE FOR REASON. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE TIME FOR OUR NATION. OUR COUNTRY IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. AND TODAY WE JUST HAD THE LARGEST ONE DAY INCREASE IN THE STOCK MARKET IN HISTORY. THAT'S GREAT. OUR OPPONENTS WERE SAYING OH MAYBE THE ECONOMY MAYBE MAYBE THEY'LL DO ANYTHING. I AM SURE THEY WERE THRILLED. DO YOU THINK OUR OPPONENTS WERE THRILLED WHEN THEY SAW THE STOCK MARKET? I DON'T THINK SO. BY THE WAY LOOK AT THIS. LOOK BACK THERE. LOOK AT ALL OF THAT PRESS. I DON'T KNOW SLEEPY JOE OR BERNIE HAD THAT MUCH PRESS. BERNIE WAS GOING WILD. WHY WOULD I BE HERE TONIGHT? WHY WOULD I BE HERE? HE SAID WHY WOULD I BE HERE TONIGHT? WE DON'T HAVE THE PRIMARY. WE'VE ALREADY WON THE THING YOU KNOW. I WAS GOING TO SAY THERE YOU KNOW WHAT THING BUT I HELD IT BACK BECAUSE THEY'LL SAY HORRIBLE LANGUAGE THEY WILL USE HORRIBLE LANGUAGE. BUT WE ARE DOING FANTASTICALLY. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WERE SO UNIFIED AS IT IS NOW. NEVER EVER. YOU KNOW YOU HEAR ABOUT ENTHUSIASM FOR CRAZY BERNIE AND THAT IS TRUE HE DOES HAVE SOME ENTHUSIASM BUT MUCH LESS THAN WE HAVE AND A MUCH SMALLER GROUP OF PEOPLE TO. THERE IS NOT A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM THERE IS NOT A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM FOR BIDEN. I THOUGHT HE GAVE UP THE PRESIDENCY BECAUSE HE SAID HE'S RUNNING FOR THE SENATE. I LOOKED AT THE FIRST LADY AND SAID HEY HE'S RUNNING FOR THE SENATE. AND TODAY HE JUST SAID, SUPER THURSDAY, HE IS LOOKING FOR TO SUPER THURSDAY. JOBS ARE BOOMING IN OUR COUNTRY. IN COMES THE SOARING. POVERTY IS PLUMMETED. CONFIDENCE IS SURGING AND WE HAVE COMPLETELY REBUILT THE AWESOME POWER OF A THING CALLED THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. AND EVERY DAY FOR ME AND FOR YOU IT'S PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. EVERY DAY. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROMISES I'VE MADE, IS RIGHT TO THIS ERA, WE LOOK AT IT, IT'S THE NEVER ENDING WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WE ARE TAKING OUR SOLDIERS. WE ARE BRINGING THEM BACK HOME. WE ARE NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ARE BRINGING THEM BACK HOME. AMERICAN TROOPS CANNOT BE THE POLICEMAN FOR THE WORLD, OR TO CREATE DEMOCRACY AND OTHER NATIONS AND FRANKLY PROBABLY DON'T WANT IT. THE TOP OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY IS TO SECURE AND DEFEND OUR COUNTRY. ... ... TWO DATES AGO THE UNITED STATES SIGNED A DEAL WITH THE TALIBAN AFTER 19 YEARS OF CONFLICT AND VERY CLOSE TO 20. WE CAN FINALLY BEGIN TO BRING OUR AMAZING TROOPS BACK HOME. AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING FOREIGN NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY BUILDING OUR NATION AND TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN AMERICAN CITIZENS. AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE, WE'VE WIPED OUT TERRORISM, WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ARE 8000 MILES AWAY. YOU GOT A LOT OF BIG COUNTRIES SURROUNDING AFGHANISTAN. YOU HAVE AFGHANISTAN ITSELF. THE PROGRESS THERE WAS MADE, WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE EXTRAORDINARY BALLOR OF OUR MEN AND OUR WOMEN IN UNIFORM. YOU KNOW THAT. AND WE PAY A SPECIAL TRIBUTE AND I KNOW YOU PAY IT. A SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO OUR GREAT WOUNDED WARRIORS AND THOSE WHO MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. AS WE BRING BACK OUR TROOPS WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURE THAT FOREIGN TERRORISTS ARE DENIED ADMISSION TO AMERICA AND THE FIRST PLACE. THEY ARE NOT COMING HERE, AND IF THEY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO THEM. WE MUST KEEP RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. BY THE WAY I HAVE TO SAY THIS. YOU HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE, AND SOMEBODY WAS SAYING THAT IF POCAHONTAS OR ANYONE OF THEM, SLEEPY JOE, HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT, BUT IF SLEEPY JOE OR IF ANY OF THEM HAD A CROWD ONE TENTH OF THE SIZE, THEY GO AROUND TALKING ABOUT HOW BIG THE CROWD IS. TAKE YOUR CAMERAS AND SPIN THAT SPIN THEM AROUND THIS BIG ARENA. THEY DON'T TURN HIM THEY DON'T TURN THEM. YOU NOTICE THEY DON'T TURN. THEM BUT IF THERE WAS TROUBLE IN THE CORNER, ANYTHING TO MAKE US LOOK BAD, THAT CAMERA WOULD TURN LIKE A PRETZEL. I USED TO THINK MODERN EQUIPMENT CAN'T TURN, BUT WE WOULD HAVE A PROTESTER AND I MUST SAY I'LL SAY IT OUT LOUD, WE DON'T HAVE TOO MANY PROTESTERS ANYMORE DO WE? WE DON'T HAVE TOO MANY. NO FUN TO BE A PROTESTER AT A TRUMP RALLY. BUT DO WE HAVE A GREAT TIME AT A TRUMP RALLY? MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO TAKEN THE MOST AGGRESSIVE ACTION IN MODERN HISTORY. TO PROTECT AMERICANS FROM THE CORONA VIRUS. YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING. IT'S HORRIBLE. INCLUDING SWEEPING TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS. TODAY WE MET WITH THE BIG GREAT PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, AND THEY ARE REALLY WORKING HARD AND WORKING SMART, AND WE HAD A GREAT MEETING TODAY WITH A LOT OF THE GREAT COMPANIES THEY HAVE THEY WILL HAVE VACCINES RELATIVELY SOON. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU BETTER AND THAT WILL ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE EVEN SOONER, SO A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. BUT WE HAVE STRONG BORDERS AND REALLY OUR TOUGH AND EARLY ACTIONS HAVE REALLY BEEN PROVEN TO BE 100% RIGHT. WE WENT OUT. WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING TO KEEP IN OUR POWER TO KEEP THE SICK AND INFECTED PEOPLE FROM COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD. WE CLOSED OUR BORDERS VERY EARLY. I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT FOR THAT. REMEMBER WHEN I CLOSED THE BORDERS TO CERTAIN AREAS OF THE WORLD? I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT, BUT THERE ARE GLOBALISTS WHO WOULD RATHER KEEP OUR BORDERS OPEN AND KEEP OUR INFECTIONS, THINK OF IT, THINK OF ALL THE INFECTIONS THAT WOULD COME IN. WE ARE WORKING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES AND ALTERNATE FAIRNESS. WE ARE WORKING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. REMEMBER THIS. OVER THE LAST LONG PERIOD OF TIME, THE FLU, FROM 27,000 TO 70,000 PEOPLE GET INFECTED, AND MANY PEOPLE DIE. THINK OF IT. 27,000. YOU LOSE 27,000 PEOPLE TO THE COMMON FLU. IT CAN BE MUCH MORE. WHEN YEAR WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE 70,000 NUMBER. THOSE PEOPLE DIE. SO WHEN YOU LOSE 27,000 PEOPLE A YEAR, NOBODY KNEW THAT. I DID NOT KNOW. THAT THREE FOUR WEEKS AGO I WAS SITTING DOWN I SAID WHEN WE LOSE WITH THE REGULAR FLU? THEY SAID 20,000 MINIMUM AND GOES UP TO 70 SOMETIMES EVEN 80. WHEN YEAR IT WENT UP TO 100,000 PEOPLE. I SAID NOBODY TOLD ME THAT NOBODY KNOWS THAT. SO I TOLD THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES YOU HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB WITH THAT VACCINE. REALLY. YOU HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB ON THAT VACCINE. LAST YEAR WAS APPROXIMATELY 36,000 PEOPLE DIED. WE ARE WORKING HARD ON IT AND WE ARE GOING TO COME UP WITH SOME REALLY GREAT SOLUTIONS. IN THE MEANTIME, WE ARE STOPPING. ONLY IN NORTH CAROLINA. ONLY IN NORTH CAROLINA. HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE ARE FROM SOUTH CAROLINA BY THE WAY? ... WILL WE HAVE BOTH PLACES BUT THAT WAS FROM NORTH CAROLINA. BUT JUST TO FINISH UP. WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS, WE REALLY DONE A GREAT JOB WITH IT. WE ARE KEEPING OUR BORDER STRONG. MY JOB IS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF AMERICAN PATIENTS AND AMERICANS FIRST. AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE DOING. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO POLITICIZE THE CORONAVIRUS. DENIGRATING THE NOBLE WORK OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, BUT HONESTLY NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE. EVERYONE APPRECIATES THEM. THESE ARE THE GREATEST PROFESSIONALS IN THE WORLD AT WHAT THEY DO. WE ARE ACTUALLY HELPING A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE SOME VERY VERY BIG PROBLEMS. WE HAVE OUR PROFESSIONALS IN CONSTANT TOUCH. I AM IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH SOME OF THE LEADERS AND HELPING THEM OUT, BUT THE POLITICAL ATTACKS OF SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS REALLY MUST START. WE HAVE GOT TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS ONE TO SAFEGUARD OUR PEOPLE. WE WILL SAFEGUARD OUR PEOPLE. THE UNITED STATES. THE UNITED STATES IS, RIGHT NOW, RANKED BY FAR, NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD FOR PREPAREDNESS. EARLIER TODAY WHEN I MET WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, THINGS WERE DISCUSSED AND LEARNED. HONESTLY, THE MEDIA DID NOT KNOW, NOBODY KNEW, THEY HAD NEVER HEARD THIS BEFORE, AND WE LEARNED A LOT, AND MAYBE THAT HAD THE IMPACT OF THE STOCK MARKET. WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED? BUT WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING, THE DURATION OF THE VIRUS. WE DISCUSSED ALL OF THESE THINGS. WE WILL BRING THESE THERAPIES TO MARK IT AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE, AND I HAVE TO SAY, WITH A THRIVING ECONOMY, THE WAY IT IS, AND THE MOST ADVANCED HEALTH SYSTEM ON EARTH, AMERICA IS SO RESULTANT. WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE HAVE THE GREATEST PEOPLE ON EARTH. WE HAVE THE GREATEST HEALTH SYSTEM ON EARTH. WE HAVE THE GREATEST HEALTH SYSTEM ON EARTH. THE RENEWAL OF AMERICAN STRENGTH OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS MEANS OUR TIMES OF CHALLENGE. WE ARE THE BEST PREPARED TO RISE TO ANY OCCASION. NO COUNTRY IS BETTER EQUIPPED THAN AMERICA TO HANDLE NEW THREATS, AND KNOW PEOPLE ARE MORE SKILLED, TALENTED, TOUGH, OR DRIVEN, THEN AMERICANS. AND TOGETHER, WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT AMERICAN COMEBACK. THAT IS WHAT IT IS. LAST MONTH, WE ADDED 225,000 NEW JOBS IN JANUARY ALONE. THAT MAKES 7 MILLION JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION. WE HAVE DESTROYED THE ISIS TERRITORY AND WE KILL THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF ISIS AL-BAGHDADI HE IS DEAD. AND WE TOOK OUT THE WORLD QASSEM SOLEIMANI, ENDING HIS EVIL REIGN OF TERROR FOREVER. SOLEIMANI. WHILE THE EXTREME LEFT HAS BEEN WASTING AMERICA'S TIME WITH FILE HOAXES AND DELUSIONAL WITCH HUNTS, WE HAVE BEEN KILLING TERRORISTS, CREATING JOBS, RAISING WAGES, AND LIFTING UP AMERICAN CITIZENS OF EVERY RACE, RELIGION, COLOR, AND CREEK. TOMORROW, VOTERS IN STATES ACROSS THE NATION WILL HEAD TO THE POLLS FOR SUPER TUESDAY, NOT SUPER THURSDAY. OH HE SAID SUPER THURSDAY. YOU CAN'T DO THESE THINGS. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I SAID SUPER THURSDAY? IT WOULD BE OVER. I WOULD BE OVER. NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE AT CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN'T AS AN EXAMPLE NAME LIKE, SLEEPY JOE. HE IS CONSTANTLY NAMING THE WRONG STATES. IT'S GREAT TO BE IN THE STATE OF A HIGH OH. NO I'M SORRY YOU ARE IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA. NO NO. JOE. DID YOU EVER SEE HIM RUN IN WITH A SIGN, NO NO NORTH CAROLINA JOE. ONCE THAT HAPPENS YOU MIGHT AS WELL LEAVE THE STATES IT'S A DISASTER NO MATTER HOW GOOD IT LOOKS. WE'RE NORTH CAROLINA, IT'S GREAT TO BE IN IDAHO. NO YOU ARE IN IOWA. NOW, HE MAKES A LOT OF THOSE MISTAKES. IT'S A LITTLE SCARY. YOU HAVE TO PROTECT YOUR SECOND AMENDMENTS TO SEE GUNS. BUT DID YOU SEE SLEEPY JOE? DID YOU SEE SLEEPY JOE WHERE HE SAID, LAST YEAR 150 MILLION PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY GUNS AND OUR COUNTRY. 150 MILLION. THAT MEANS 50% OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S A BIG STORY MAN. COULD YOU IMAGINE TRUMP SAYING THAT? THESE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER LET ME LIVE. WE CAN'T MAKE A LITTLE MISTAKE RIGHT? WE CAN'T EVEN MAKE A LITTLE TINY TINY MISTAKE. IF WE MAKE A TINY MISTAKE IT'S HEADLINE NEWS. THEY SAY THINGS LIKE 150 MILLION PEOPLE KILLED, GUNS. THEY SAY SUPER THURSDAY. THEY SAY GEORGIA. HE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO WINNING GEORGIA TOMORROW. GEORGIA IS NOT IN SUPER TUESDAY. SO MANY MISTAKES. YOU CANNOT DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE NEGOTIATING WITH CHINA. YOU CANNOT DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE NEGOTIATING WITH THESE COUNTRIES, YOU CANNOT DO THAT. THOSE MISTAKES WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE. THEN YOU HAVE MANY MIKE. YOU SEE THIS GUY? MANY MIKE. HE'S BEING INTERVIEW TONIGHT ON FOX, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? FOX. THEY WANT TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT. THEY END UP INTERVIEWING MORE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH FOX. BUT THEY ARE INTERVIEWING THIS GUY THE NIGHT BEFORE. MANY MIKE IAEA WHAT A MESS HE IS. IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES THE WORST PERFORMANCE. . I WOULD GET DOWN REALLY LOW BUT I DON'T WANT TO COPY EVERYBODY. EVERYONE SAYS OH, DO THAT AGAIN WHERE YOU GET DOWN LOW, BUT IF I DO THAT AGAIN, IT IS A COPY. IT IS A COPY. . NO. NO. NO. HE NEVER LIKED A COPY. EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE COPYING YOURSELF YOU DON'T LIKE TO COPY. YOU DO IT ONCE. IT WAS A BIG HIT, BUT YOU DO IT ONCE AND YOU SAY THAT WAS NICE, DON'T DO IT AGAIN. IF IT DOESN'T WORK THE SECOND TIME IT GETS EMBARRASSING RIGHT? WE ALL KNOW. BUT NOW HE IS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. HE IS A MESS. NO MATTER WHICH DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ANY ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES, AND YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT? THEY ARE ALL NOW, IT'S BEING RIGGED AGAINST, IT'S SAD, IT IS BEING RIGGED AGAINST CRAZY BERNIE. CRAZY BERNIE IS GOING TO GO CRAZY. CRAZY. I THINK CRAZY BERNIE IS GOING TO BE MORE CRAZY WHEN THEY SEE WHAT THERE WHEN HE SEES WHAT THEY ARE DOING. I CALLED IT A LONG TIME AGO. MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG. MAYOR PETE, HE QUIT OUT LAST NIGHT, AND THEN I HEAR, THEN I HEAR SENATOR FORMER STATE SAY WE'RE GONNA WIN WE'RE GOING TO WIN THAT STATE BUT SHE TRUMPED UP. SOUNDS LIKE THEY MADE A DEAL. THEY BOTH SUPPORTED SLEEPY JOE AND YOU KNOW WHY? THEY MADE A DEAL. YOU KNOW WHY? QUID PRO CROW, THAT IS WHY. QUID PRO QUO. QUID PRO QUO, THEY MADE A DEAL. IMPEACH THEM, THEY SHOULD BE IMPEACHED. THEY SHOULD BE IMPEACHED. QUID PRO CROW. BUT THEY HAVE EMBRACE AN EXTREME LEFT WING AGENDA. THEY PLAN THEIR PLANS WOULD MASSIVELY RAISE YOUR TAXES MUZZLE FAITH AND ERASE OUR SOVEREIGNTY. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS GONE CRAZY. WHETHER IT'S BERNIE SANDERS'S PLAN, TO ILLUMINATE PRIVATE HEALTH CARE. ELIZABETH POCAHONTAS IS, BY THE WAY SHE'S HISTORY. SHE IS HISTORY. I CAME UP WITH THAT NAME FAR TOO EARLY, I SHOULD HAVE JUST WAITED. IT DIDN'T MATTER, I THOUGHT SHE WAS MAKING A COMEBACK. I SAID I JUST DID IT TO HER. BUT YOU KNOW THOSE EMBERS WERE BURNING A LITTLE BIT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. AND FACTUAL PROBABLY LOSE THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS TO BERNIE. SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LOSE THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. SHE IS THE SENATOR FOR MASSACHUSETTS. I THINK SHE WILL LOSE IT TO BERNIE. AND THIS MICHIGAN, YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON OVER THERE? MICHIGAN WERE LEADING AND WISCONSIN, WE ARE LEADING IN FLORIDA, WE ARE LEADING IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WE ARE LEADING IN NORTH CAROLINA. WE ARE LEADING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE ARE LEADING IN THE GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST STATES OUR LAST ELECTION, HEY HOW GREAT WAS THE 2016 ELECTION? RIGHT? ONE OF THE GREATEST NIGHTS, ONE OF THE MOST HIGHEST RATED TELEVISION NIGHTS AND THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION, AND REMEMBER THEY WERE LIKE OH THIS IS GOING TO BE A QUICK ONE THAT WAS AND SO EASY FOR THEM. OH I LOVE THE SCENE. THE SCENE OF THEIR CONVENTION CENTER, WHERE HILLARY WAS GETTING READY TO SPEAK AND THEN SHE FOUND OUT SHE LOST. BUT ELIZABETH WARREN SHE HAD A PLAN TO ELIMINATE OUR BORDERS. OR MANY MICS PLAN TO ELIMINATE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. MIKE BLOOMBERG WANTS TO ELIMINATE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT IT WON'T HAPPEN. IT WON'T HAPPEN FOR HIM. FOR SLEEPY JOE, HE DOES NOT EVEN KNOW WHERE HE IS OR WHAT HE IS DOING. OR WET OFFICE HE IS RUNNING FOR. ACTUALLY, I HONESTLY DON'T THINK WHAT OFFICE I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT OFFICE HE'S RUNNING FOR. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER, MAYBE HE GETS AND BECAUSE HE IS A LITTLE MORE MODERATE, MAYBE HE GETS IT, BUT HE WON'T BE RUNNING IT OTHER PEOPLE WILL. THEY WILL PUT HIM INTO A HOME AND OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY, AND THEY WILL BE SUPER LEFT RADICAL CRAZY'S. THEY WILL BE SUPER LEFT RADICAL CRAZY'S ANGELA WILL BE IN A HOME WATCHING TELEVISION. EVERYTHING WILL BE JUST FINE. THE INSANITY OF WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS IS WHY MILLIONS OF REGISTERED DEMOCRAT VOTERS ARE JOINING OUR MOVEMENT. THEY OUR JOINING OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY. TURN THOSE TELEVISIONS WE HAD THIS ENTHUSIASM IN OUR PARTY. I CONSTANTLY HEAR ABOUT THE ENTHUSIASM. THEY ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER, THEY ARE HATING EACH OTHER THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. WE HAVE ALL THE 11TH UZI OUT SOME AND WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. SO WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED TONIGHT BY MANY REALLY GREAT TERRIFIC BRILLIANT WONDERFUL WARRIORS. EVEN THOUGH IT COMES FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STATE BUT NOT TOO FAR BY, IS SOMEBODY THAT HAS REALLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AND BECOME A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE. WHAT HE DID FOR JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? ONE OF THE GREATEST STATEMENTS EVER MADE IN THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM COME ON UP. LINDSEY GRAHAM, COME ON UP. COME HERE LINDSAY. I GOTTA HAVE HIM SAY SOMETHING. HELLO CHARLOTTE. IT'S GOOD TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE I DON'T HAVE AN ACCESS.

SOME PEOPLE THAT HAVE REALLY BEEN HELPFUL TO ME, TORY LEWANDOWSKI, DAVID BOSSY, AND PAM BONDI, GREAT PEOPLE. AND THANKS ALSO TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING TO MAKE THE 2020 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION RIGHT HERE IN CHARLOTTE, AN OUTSTANDING SUCCESS. OUR CHAIRMAN RONNA MCDANIEL, RNC COCHAIRMAN TOMMY HICKS, AND CONGRESSIONAL PRESIDENT MARTIALLY KELLY. THANK YOU EVERYBODY. THEY ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. THEY HAVE GOT TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY AND DOING A GREAT JOB. DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB EARN A CATCH OF AS LONG AS YOU WIN. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID WHEN WE WON LAST TIME? SOMEBODY ELSE TOOK THE CONVENTION CENTER AND SPENT A FORTUNE. I JUST TOOK A HOTEL BALLROOM AND SAID WITH THE HECK, IF I WIN NOBODY CARES, AND IF I DON'T, LOOK IF YOU WIN NOBODY CARES WHAT ROOM YOU ARE IN. IF YOU LOSE, NOBODY CARES WHAT ROOM YOU ERIN WRAY? SO WE TOOK A BALLROOM, A NICE BALLROOM NO BIG DEAL. I FIGURED, THIS WAY IF WE WIN, NOBODY CARES, AND IF WE LOSE, I AM OUT OF THERE AND I SAVE A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY. BUT I NEVER THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO LOSE, TRUMP FELT THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO WIN. SURE I'M RUNNING BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO LOSE. THAT IS NOT THE DEAL. IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE IF YOU DON'T WIN, BUT BOY I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO WIN AND WE WERE GETTING CROWDS LIKE. THIS ACTUALLY, TO BE HONEST, I THINK OUR CROWDS NOW ARE BIGGER, STRONGER, AND EVEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC. I REALLY THINK THEY ARE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC THAN EVER BEFORE. WE ARE EIGHT MONTHS AWAY, THAT IS A LONG TIME. IT'S NOT EVEN AND, CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD WE'VE GUIDED MADE IN THE PRIMARIES. I THINK WE HAVE GOT IT MADE. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE FOR US WE'RE NOT EVEN INTO POLITICAL SEASON AND WE ARE GETTING CROWDS LIKE THIS. WE WERE ALL OVER OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. WE LIKE TO TROLL, WE LIKE TO GO THE NIGHT BEFORE ONE OF THEIR PRIMARIES, AND WE DO A LITTLE TROLLING. IT'S CALLED WE DO A LITTLE TROLLING. BERNIE SANDERS WAS VERY UPSET. WHY WOULD HE BE THERE? WHY? BECAUSE I WANT TO WIN. THAT'S A GOOD REASON. BUT HONESTLY, WHAT YOU SEE WHEN YOUR TWO MONTHS OR THREE MONTHS OUT, WE ARE GETTING NUMBERS THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

GEORGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU GEORGE. 100 YEARS OLD. HE'S 100 AND HE LOOKS GOOD THANK YOU GEORGE. WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE HERE TONIGHT, AMERICA HAS NOW BECOME THE HOTTEST ECONOMY ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET EARTH. SINCE MY ELECTION, OVER 219,000 NEW JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED RIGHT HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA. WE HAVE LIFTED 10 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF WELFARE, INCLUDING 7 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVEL EVER EVER RECORDED. THINK OF THAT. THE AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FROM MY ADMINISTRATION IS THE LOWEST FOR ANY U.S. PRESIDENT IN RECORDED HISTORY. THAT IS THAT BIG. IT IS THAT BIG. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS HISPANIC AMERICANS, ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN RECORDED HISTORY. VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. AFRICAN AMERICAN, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED AN ALL-TIME LOW. AFRICAN AMERICAN POVERTY IS AT THE LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED. FOR DECADES, DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS BETRAYED AND THEY TRULY DID. THEY BETRAYED AFRICAN AMERICANS. MY ADMINISTRATION IS DELIVERING FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS, LIKE NEVER BEFORE. NO PRESIDENT HAS DONE MORE FOR OUR BLACK COMMUNITY. NO PRESIDENT HAS DONE MORE FOR OUR BLACK COMMUNITY, AND IT IS AN HONOR TO DO IT. LAST MONTH HERE IN CHARLOTTE, WE LAUNCHED A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN TO CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL AMERICANS. IT IS CALLED OPPORTUNITY NOW. YOU KNOW ABOUT IT. WE ARE ALSO FIGHTING TO ENSURE THAT WORKING FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE, REDUCING THE COST OF CHILDCARE AND GIVING 40 MILLION AMERICAN FAMILIES AN AVERAGE OF 2200 DOLLARS THANKS TO THE REPUBLICAN CHILD TAX CREDIT. THE REPUBLICANS ARE CLAIMING THAT WE DID THAT. NOBODY ELSE DID THAT. BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING HOW DID THEY DO THAT ONE? WE ARE REVERSING DECADES OF CALAMITOUS TRADE POLICIES THAT THE SUN MADE IT MANUFACTURING IN NORTH CAROLINA. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT. IT IS PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE REASON I'M RUNNING. THE DEALS WE ARE MAKING, THE TRADE DEALS WHO ARE MAKING ARE UNBELIEVABLE. YOUR STATE LOST 43% OF ALL MANUFACTURING SHOPS, AFTER NAFTA WAS SIGNED. THINK ABOUT THAT. WEEKS AGO, WE FINALLY ENDED THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE AND I SIGNED THE BRAND NEW U.S. MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT IN THE WORLD. THE USMCA IS A GIANT VICTORY FOR NORTH CAROLINA. AND CREDIBLE FOR FARMERS AND FACTORY WORKERS. BY THE WAY SPEAKING OF FARMERS AND FACTORY WARNER'S FACTORY WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, FOR THE DEATH TAX. YOU KNOW THE INHERITANCE TAX? YOU HAVE A SMALL FARM SOMEPLACE YOU HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS, YOU HAVE A NICE BUSINESS. YOU KNOW LONGER HAVE AN INHERITANCE TAX OR A DEATH TAX SO IF YOU WANT IT TO YOU OR LEAVE IT TO YOUR CHILDREN YOU CAN LEAVE IT TO YOUR CHILDREN. THERE IS NO TAX TO BE PAID BY YOUR CHILDREN. SO THEY DO NOT HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE EVIL BANK AND MORE MONEY FROM THE BANKER, LOSE THE FARM, LOSE THE BUSINESS. IT WON'T HAPPEN. AND I ALWAYS SAY, I KNOW A LOT OF PARENTS, THEY DON'T LOVE THEIR CHILDREN VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM THAT DOES NOT LOVE YOUR CHILDREN? PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. NOBODY. NOBODY, THAT IS BECAUSE WE ARE NORTH CAROLINA. YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN. BUT IF YOU DON'T, THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR CHILDREN DON'T LEAVE THEM A THING OK? BUT YOU DON'T YOU DO NOT HAVE THE INHERITANCE TAX ANYMORE WHICH IS GREAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT BUT IT IS A BIG DEAL. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS MORE THOROUGHLY BETRAYED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEN ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION. EVERY DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR DEMOCRATS SUPPORTS FREE FEDERAL WELFARE FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS ON YOUR TAXES. NOT ONLY DOES ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION DURING OUR TREASURY, BUT IT THREATENS INNOCENT LIVES, AS A JUST ONE HEARTBREAKING EXAMPLE, TWO ILLEGAL ALIENS IN MARYLAND THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER WAS RELEASED UNACCOUNTABLE RELEASED AND WENT ON TO MURDER A TEENAGE GIRL, BEATING HER WITH A BASEBALL BAT AND SLASHING HER WITH A MACHETE. THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC FIELD SUPPORTS DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES, WHICH RELEASE DANGEROUS CRIMINALS TO TERRORIZE YOUR COMMUNITIES, RIGHT HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA, BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE SANCTUARY COUNTY OF DURHAM RELEASED AN ILLEGAL ALIEN CRIMINAL, WHO THEN PROCEEDED TO VICIOUSLY MURDER A YOUNG 19-YEAR-OLD WOMAN LAST YEAR, YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT, KILLING HER AND DUMPING HER BODY INTO THE WOODS. LAST YEAR ALONE, SANCTUARY JURISDICTIONS IN NORTH CAROLINA, HOW DID THAT HAPPEN TO NORTH CAROLINA? DELIBERATELY SET FREE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS, AND THESE ARE REALLY DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS INCLUDING THOSE CHARGED OR CONVICTED OF BURGLARY, GUN CRIMES, SEXUAL ASSAULT, KIDNAPPING AND EVEN MURDER GOT TO CHANGE THIS. AND WILL BAN SANCTUARY CITIES IN YOUR STATE, WHAT IS HE THINKING? BUT WHILE YOU ARE SUPER LEVEL GOVERNOR IS PUTTING YOUR FAMILIES AT RISK, YOUR REPUBLICAN SENATOR TOM TILLIS HAS INTRODUCED A BILL ALLOWING AMERICAN VICTIMS TO SUE SANCTUARY CITIES FOR THE HORRIBLE PAIN, ANGUISH, AND SUFFERING THAT INFLICT ON OUR PEOPLE WE'RE BUILDING THE WALL, WE'RE BUILDING THE BALL, WE'RE BUILDING THE BALL, WE'RE BUILDING THE WALL! MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL, BY THE WAY. . WE BUILT 127 MILES AS OF TODAY, 127 MILES. AND MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL. THE MEDIA IS GOING TO BE THRILLED WHEN I EXPLAIN. BECAUSE FINALLY THEY SAY I'VE HAD OBSTRUCTION LIKE YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT, THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. I CAN GET ANYTHING, I CREATED SPACE FORCE, I CAN DO ANYTHING. BUT LINDSAY AND TOM TILLIS KNOW THIS, MARK KNOWS, THIS ALL OF THEM KNOW THIS, IF I WANT TO TEN CENTS FOR THE WALL THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT, BUT NOW WE HAVE IT AND YOU THINK THAT IS EASY? NOBODY SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS, WE ARE BUILDING OUR HEARTS AWAY, WE WILL SOON BE BUILDING MANY MILES A WEEK, BUT WE'RE UP TO OVER 125, 127 MILES OF THE SUPER WALL. I WANT TO BORDER PATROL AND SAID WHAT IS YOUR WISH, WELL IT'S LIKELY TO BE STEEL AND CONCRETE. THEY WANTED EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE, AND THE BARRIERS UP TOP ONE EVERYTHING, IT'S CALLED A NO CLIMB PROVIDER, NO CLIMB PROVIDES, OR I SAID WHAT IS THE WORD PROVIDES OR MAINE AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. I MEAN YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO CLIMB OVER, IT'S VERY TOUGH. AND A PART OF THE WALL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THEY WERE PLANNING A WALL AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS TO TAKE THEM, DOWN THAT IS WHAT THE NO CLIMB IS. THAT'S A NO CRIME, AND WHAT A VOICE. WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL, IT'S GOING GREAT, SO THEY SAID HE'S BUILDING THE WALL, BUT MEXICO'S NOT PAYING FOR IT. YOU WILL SEE. YOU WILL SEE. SOME OF YOU UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I TOLD A FEW PEOPLE LAST WEEK AND IT WAS LEAKED TO THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA, IF YOU WANT TO AND SANCTUARY CITIES IN NORTH CAROLINA, THEN YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE, YOU MUST VOTE REPUBLICAN. YOU HAVE TO. YOU HAVE TO. THINGS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE BORDER, WE HAVE REDUCED ILLEGAL BOARDING CROSSINGS BY A STAGGERING 75%. WE HAVE ENDED CATCH AND RELEASE, ONE OF THE WORST LOOPHOLES YOU EVER WILL SEE, CATCH AND RELEASE, YOU CATCH AND YOU SAY WHERE DO YOU LIVE? THEY DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, THEY DON'T KNOW, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT,. AND MEXICO, MAYBE HONDURAS, GUATEMALA, WHO KNOWS, EL SALVADOR WHERE, DO YOU LIVE? THIS GUY IS A MEXICAN, YOU ARE ABOUT AS MEXICAN AS I AM. LOOK AT THIS GUY, HE'S AS MEXICAN AS I AM, LOOK AT THAT HAT. ARE YOU MEXICAN? ARE YOU MEXICAN? NO, YOU ARE NOT. ARE YOU? HE IS. IT'S LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN, SHE SAID SHE WAS AN INDIAN, I SAID RIGHT. I SAID I HAVE MORE INDIAN BLOOD IN ME THEN YOU HAVE AND I HAVE NOT, AND SHE SAID THIS IS TERRIBLE, THAT SHE WENT OUT AND GOT A TEST, AND IT TURNED OUT NOT SO GOOD FOR HER. 1024TH. 1000TH. SO I THOUGHT I HAVE MORE AND ME. WHAT A PHONY SHE IS. WHAT A PHONY. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME, 100 CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR BERNIE SANDERS HEALTH CARE TAKEOVER AND THE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS TRY TO DESTROY YOUR HEALTH CARE AND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, AND THEY ARE GOING TO DESTROY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. REMEMBER THEY USED TO SAY WITH ME, I'M GOING TO END THE FIRST TIME, AND ALL OF THAT HAS MADE IT STRONGER, YOU KNOW THAT. MY ADMINISTRATION IS PROTECTING YOU, SOCIAL SECURITY, YOUR MEDICARE FAN DECIDING TO GIVE YOU GREAT HEALTH CARE, WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE GREAT HEALTH CARE. WE ARE DEFENDING YOUR RIGHT TO KEEP THE DOCTOR AND A PLAN OF YOUR CHOICE. REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA? YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR AND YOUR PLAN. 28 TIMES THEY SAID IMPEACH HIM, YOU SHOULD IMPEACH HIM, WE SHOULD IMPEACH HIM. 20 TIMES HE SAID THAT YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PLAN, WELL IT'S NOT TRUE. THERE WASN'T. IMPEACH HIM. WE ARE MAKING HEALTH CARE BETTER AND MUCH CHEAPER PREMIUMS DOUBLED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE. WE ARE NOW UP TO 60% LESS EXPENSIVE AND THEY ARE BETTER PLANS. WE ARE PROTECTING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND WE ALWAYS WELL. WE ARE TRYING TO TERMINATE THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE WORSE HEALTH CARE IN THE WORLD AND WE ARE TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE BEST HEALTH CARE YOU'VE EVER SEEN AT A LOWER PRICE, AND OF COURSE, PROTECTING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. PROTECTING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE'RE FIGHTING TO STOP SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? SURPRISE, YOU GET ALL SORTS OF SURPRISES. PEOPLE TAKE A BLOOD TEST AND IN ONE PLACE IS 26 DOLLARS, AND IN THE OTHER PLACE IT'S 2000 DOLLARS. SAME BLOOD TEST, MAYBE THE CHEAP ONE IS BETTER, WHO KNOWS. SAME BLOOD TESTS, IT'S WRONG. SURPRISE, MEDICAL BUILDING. I SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IMPOSING PRICE TRANSPARENCY, THAT IS GOING TO BE BIGGER THAN HEALTH CARE BECAUSE WHEN PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW THEIR PRICES, THOSE SAME PRICES FALL VERY FAST, IT'S A BIG THING. THAT'S A BIG THING. WE HAVE APPROVED A RECORD NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE DRUGS THAT ARE AS GOOD AS NAME BRAND DRUGS BUT A FRACTION OF THE COST. WE HAVE GIVEN THEM, AND THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL PRESSURE NOT TO DO THAT, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY. TO CARE FOR OUR AMAZING VETERANS, WE PASSED VA CHOICE AND VA ACCOUNTABILITY, AND NOBODY SAID IT COULD BE DONE. SO INSTEAD OF WAITING ONLINE FOR DAYS AND DAYS AND WEEKS AND WEEKS TO SEE A DOCTOR, YOU GO OUTSIDE, YOU GET A DOCTOR, YOU GET ALL FIXED UP, WHAT A GREAT THING. IT'S CALLED ME A CHOICE. HE'S BEEN TRYING TO PASS IT FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE. AND THOSE PEOPLE WERE A GREAT HELP, WE HAVE PASSED A SPECTACULAR RIGHT TO TRY, YOU KNOW THAT IS? HOPEFULLY NOBODY NEEDS IT. HOPEFULLY NOBODY IN THE ROOM NEEDS WHITE TO TRY, WE ARE COMBATTING THE OPIOID ACADEMIC, DECLINING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY 31 YEARS. BIG PROBLEM. AND WE HAVE LAUNCHED NEW INITIATIVES COMBATTING GETTING DISEASE AND ALZHEIMER'S. AND WE ARE PURSUING NEW ADVANCES IN NEONATAL RESEARCH TO CARE FOR AMERICA'S YOUNGEST PATIENCE, AND BREAKING ALL RECORDS IN SO DOING. FORTUNATELY EVERY DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE HAS DECLARED THEIR UNLIMITED SUPPORT FOR LATE TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABY STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB, RIGHT UP UNTIL THE VERY MOMENT OF BIRTH. HOW ABOUT THAT? THAT IS WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT LATE TERM ABORTIONS UP A PIECE BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT OF GOD. THEN YOU HAVE THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, THE BABY IS BORN THE BABY IS BORN YOUTH ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MOTHER ABOUT IF YOU EXECUTE THE BABY, THIS IS THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, HE IS A BEAUTY, REMEMBER WHAT HE DID? HE WANTED TO DANCE LIKE MICHAEL JACKSON AND HIS WIFE STOPPED HIM, HE GOT LUCKY. BUT THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA WANTED TO DO THE BABY IS BORN AND THEN HE GOES OVER AND TALKS TO THE MOTHER AND YOU MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE BABY LIVE. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THAT? THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS THE PARTY OF LATE TERM ABORTIONS, OPEN BORDERS, SOCIALISM, BLATANT CORRUPTION AND THE OBLITERATION OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN. SO MANY PEOPLE CAME UP TO ME TODAY, AND THEY WANT ME TO FIGHT AND WE ARE DOING IT FOR SCHOOL CHOICE SO THAT EVERY CHILD WHO NEEDS IT GETS IT WITH NO PARENT EVER FORCING TO SEND THEIR CHILD TO A FAILING GOVERNMENT COOL. I PASS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, ALICE JOHNSON, AND THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL AND OPEN THE AMERICAN CAPITAL IN JERUSALEM. WE RECOGNIZE THE SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS, OUR HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES MILITARY, INCLUDE 200 MILLION DOLLARS TO A PLACE THAT NOBODY HAS HEARD OF IN THIS AUDIENCE, I'M SURE. FORT BRAGG. 300 MILLION DOLLARS FOR A MARINE CORPSb POINT. MORE THAN 500 MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN AIR STATION NEW RIVER, AND LISTEN TO THIS ONE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND MONEY, MORE THAN 1.2 BILLION DOLLARS FOR CAMP LESSON. AND I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS, WE HAVE TO HAVE A STRONG MILITARY, WE HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY WE'VE EVER HAD. OUR MILITARY AND 1.2 MILLION DOLLARS WENT INTO. WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE OUR POLITICIANS, AND YOU WANT A PRESIDENT STANDING UP FOR AMERICA, AND WE'RE STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA AND ALWAYS WELL. . AS TAKEN OUR PRESENT BATTLE WITH THE ACTUAL SURVIVAL OF OUR NATION ITSELF. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO INHERIT THAT BLESSINGS OF GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS WHO FOUGHT AND DIED TO SECURE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SECURING US, OUR FREEDOM, WE ARE DEVOTING EVERYTHING WE HAVE TOWARDS VICTORY IN NOVEMBER, NOVEMBER 3RD, TO BE EXACT. I WE HAVE TO DRAIN THE WASHINGTON SWAMP WHICH IS MUCH MORE VICIOUS AND DIRTIER AND DEEPER THAN I EVER THOUGHT BUT WE ARE KICKING. WITH YOUR HEALTH, WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK, DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE, AND POVERTY TO PROSPERITY, TOGETHER WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR, SAFE, SANE AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION. ROUND WE WILL REELECT COME TELL US. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SO ANGRY AT YOU, I ONLY COME BACK A FEW TIME OF THE YEAR. TOM IS GOING TO BE GREAT, I THINK THEY'RE A GREAT CHAMP. I THINK YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE. ONE MORE HAND FOR TOM TELL US, PLEASE. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO'S RUNNING. WE WANT TO ENACT NEW TRADE DEALS THAT RESULTED IN NEW PRODUCTS THAT ARE STAMPED WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, MADE IN THE USA. WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER, AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN LESS THAN NINE YEARS, WE'VE ALREADY STARTED. WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT. WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.",

         "Governor Ron DeSantis, First Lady Casey, Administrator Bridenstine, Director Cabana, General Selva, distinguished members of Congress, Marillyn Hewson, the dedicated men and women of NASA, and especially Rick Armstrong and the members of the Neil Armstrong family, and Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin: It is my great honor to be here with all of you today. It's great to be back here at the John F. Kennedy Space Center, as Vice President and as Chairman of the National Space Council, with my wonderful wife Karen, to celebrate - - to celebrate with all of you the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing a half a century ago that will be remembered forever. And I've been looking forward to this day, but allow me to bring greetings from another great space enthusiast and a great champion of American leadership in space. I begin today by bringing greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. Today, our nation pays tribute to the three brave astronauts who sat atop a 360-foot rocket that lifted off from Pad 39A 50 years ago this week - two of whom walked on the moon 50 years ago today. We also gather to pay tribute to the nearly 400,000 Americans - engineers, technicians, designers - whose sacrifices and dedication made it possible for Apollo 11 to complete what another president called 'the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure upon which mankind has ever embarked.' Let's hear it for all those who supported these three brave astronauts 50 years ago. When President Kennedy challenged the nation in 1961 to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the Earth before the decade was out, it's important to remember that our country was not yet ready to meet that challenge. We didn't have the rockets or the launch pads, or the spacesuits or the lander. We hadn't even invented many of the materials or tools that we would need. Not only did we not have what we needed, we didn't even know what we needed. But President Kennedy summarized that epic endeavor in one simple sentence: 'We choose to go to the moon.' The moon was a choice. An American choice. And like every time the American people make up their mind, once that decision was made, American ingenuity, grit, and determination - the achievement was inevitable. The only challenges that remained were challenges of engineering and science. The moon didn't come easily, and it didn't come without costs. And it did not come without grave danger or without sacrifice. To this day, Americans grieve the loss of three brave astronauts of Apollo 1 who were lost in a fire on the launchpad in January of 1967. And we think of them and their families even today. The risks for Apollo were so great, the odds were so long, that many feared that even if our astronauts made it to the moon, they might not make it back. In fact, history records that President Nixon prepared a speech in the event of a tragedy, where he would explain to the nation that the mission had failed. But, of course, the mission didn't fail. After all - with 400,000 men and women behind the mission at NASA, and with the hearts and prayers of the American people - how could it fail? For at the controls of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module, known as Eagle, stood two great Americans: Mission Commander Neil Armstrong and a man who is with us today, Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin. And circling overhead in lunar orbit was Command Module pilot Michael Collins. Fifty years ago today, at almost exactly this hour, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were about halfway into their powered descent on the final leg of their landing on the moon. There they were, standing beside one another in a capsule not much bigger than a couple of telephone booths, just minutes from touchdown. They thought they were ready for every contingency. After all, as Buzz told me just a few days ago, they had spent two years intensively training for this moment, and they'd run almost 600 simulated landings all designed to be more difficult than the real thing. Eagle had just finished its rollover to position itself for final approach, when all of the sudden, Neil Armstrong called out to Houston that Eagle had a '1202 Alarm.' The problem was nobody on board or in Houston had any idea what a '1202 Alarm' was. Eagle's flight computer was overloading. Not only could they not see the moon out their windows; they couldn't know for certain how far they were from the surface. Not a good way to fly. And yet, how calm they were. Working with the team back here on Earth, they quickly resolved the problem without betraying the slightest anxiety. People all over the world were watching, with no idea that anything had gone wrong. That, my friends, is what they used to call the 'Right Stuff'. You know, there's a reason Neil Armstrong, as well, was called the 'Ice Commander' in his day. When the original landing area turned out to be so full of large boulders that landing there would have doomed the mission and the crew, history records that Neil Armstrong calmly took control of the Lunar Module, skimmed along the top of the surface of the moon in search for a safe place to touch down. And by the time he found a safe spot, known to all of us as Tranquility Base, Armstrong and Aldrin had only 17 seconds of fuel remaining. Like every one of my generation, I remember that day. Six hundred million people around the world were watching their TVs and listening to their radios, waiting with admiration, anxiety, and wonder. And I was one of them - a little boy sitting in front of our black-and-white television in the basement of our home in Indiana. When those first snowy images of Neil Armstrong stepping off the bottom rung of the ladder beamed down to Earth at 10:56 p.m. on Sunday, July 20, 1969, they made an indelible mark - not just on my imagination, but on the imagination of my generation and every generation to come. It was a moment so rich in meaning that, upon hearing Neil Armstrong's first call from Tranquility Base, even the era's greatest newsman, Walter Cronkite, could only shake his head and utter two words: 'Oh, boy.' All at once, the nation held its breath - as through the crackling broadcast we listened to, we heard Neil Armstrong use those immortal words: 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' In that moment, the men of Apollo 11 did more than help expand our understanding of Creation, and they did more than win the Space Race. They brought together our nation. And for one brief moment, all the people of the world were truly one. Now, true to their creed, astronauts have never liked the idea of being called heroes. Yet for all they did - and for all the risks they took - if Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Mike Collins are not heroes, then there are no heroes. We honor these men today, and America will always honor our Apollo astronauts. They were heroes all. We honor the men of Apollo 11 by remembering their epic voyage and telling their story. But we also honor them by continuing the work they so nobly and courageously advanced in American space exploration. Apollo 11 was followed by five more successful moon missions culminating in the final historic journey of Apollo 17 - America's last trip to the moon. As we honor our Apollo 11 astronauts, we are also honored today to be joined by Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmidt. Thank you for your courageous service. As Harrison and I have discussed about his mission, while the last words spoken on the moon might not be as well-known as the first words, his fellow astronaut Gene Cernan said more perhaps than anyone could've known at the time. It was a challenge to our time. As he stepped off the moon on December 17, 1972, Gene - he said these words, and I quote, 'As I take man's last steps on the moon for some time to come, history will recordthat America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow.' And then he ended by saying, 'We leave the moon as we came and, God willingwe shall soon return with peace and hope for all mankind.' Those were words of challenge in 1972. And in our time, as President Trump said, this generation of Americans knows that it is 'America's destiny to bethe leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown.' And standing before you today, I am proud to report, at the direction of the President of the United States of America, America will return to the moon within the next five years, and the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts. We're going back. After more than 45 years, where one administration after another chose to limit America's space program to low Earth orbit, President Donald Trump has changed all that. Early in this administration, the President revived the National Space Council within the White House to coordinate all space-related activities across the government, including matters related to national security. And we've been hard at work. The Space Council has helped bring together skilled leaders in business and industry to revive and renew America's commitment to human space exploration. And I'm pleased that many members of our Users' Advisory Group for the Space Council are with us today for this historic occasion. Join me in welcoming these dedicated and distinguished Americans. The President also signed Space Policy Directive 1, 'challenging NASA to lead the return of Americans to the moon, send the first Americans to Mars, and enable humans to expand and deepen our reach across the solar system.' It is our mission. And as I speak to you today, I'm proud to report we're investing in new rockets, new spaceships. We're working with private companies around this country to develop the new technologies of the future by unleashing the burgeoning private space industry that dots the landscape of this historic center and this nation. And within the next year, we will once again send American astronauts into space on American rockets, from American soil. Already, we've given our human exploration missions a newfound sense of urgency not seen in more than a generation. And, last year, NASA and American innovators began an accelerated design process for both the lunar orbital gateway and the lunar surface base - all of which we will need to support Americans on the moon and to train and prepare to send Americans to Mars. And while we've made great strides in advancing the President's bold vision for space - unlike in years past, we will have the budgets to match it. And that's why I'm especially grateful today to be joined by some of the greatest champions of American leadership in space in the Congress of the United States: House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, Congressman Robert Aderholt, Congressman Brian Babin, Congressman Bill Posey, and other distinguished members of Congress. Would you please rise and allow us to express our appreciation for your strong support of renewed American leadership? With strong bipartisan support, this President has already signed into law the largest NASA budget ever. And on this historic occasion, I'm told that we've also achieved a critical milestone in our effort to go to the moon and beyond. Today, thanks to the hard work of the men of NASA - men and women of NASA and of American industry, the Orion crew vehicle for the Artemis 1 mission is complete and ready to begin preparations for its historic first flight. In the coming years, American astronauts will return to the moon aboard the Orion, and they'll return with new ambitions. We will spend weeks and months, not days and hours, on the lunar surface. This time we're going to the moon to stay - and to explore and develop new technologies. We will extract water from ice in the permanently shadowed craters of the South Pole. We will fly on a new generation of spacecraft that will enable us to reach Mars, not in years but in months. Americans are leading in space once again. And today we're reminded - we're reminded how American leadership 50 years ago, and the accomplishment of Apollo 11, inspired our nation. As the President said, it 'ignited our sense of adventure' and 'steeled our belief that no dream is impossible, no matter how lofty or challenging.' And as Buzz Aldrin said today, in his words, 'Looking back, landing on the moon wasn't just our job, it was a historic opportunity to prove to the world America's can-do spirit.' But as we lead in human space exploration again, we'll carry not only American ingenuity and pride, but most importantly, we'll carry America's ideals into the vast expanse of space - ideals of freedom and liberty. Apollo 11 is the only event in the 20th century that stands a chance of being widely remembered in the 30th century. A thousand years from now, July 20, 1969 will likely be a date that will live in the minds and imaginations of men and women, as long as there are men and women to remember - across this world, across this solar system, and beyond. So, today, we remember the heroes of Apollo 11 and all the heroes that supported them in their mission - some 400,000 Americans. But today, we also reaffirm our commitment to 'unlock the mysteries of space' and to lead. And as we continue on this American journey, we go with the same resolve and determination of those who have gone before. And we go with faith. Faith in the courage of this new generation of astronauts - men and women of the character and caliber of those who have gone before. They're remarkable pioneers who will carry American leadership into space. Faith in the ingenuity of the men and women of NASA and all of those across the American space enterprise, whose creativity and tireless efforts in the days ahead will match that of their forebears who created and invented new ways to explore and expanded human understanding with American leadership. And finally, I believe, as we go forward - and as millions of Americans believe in their hearts, and have throughout the generations - that we'll go forward with faith that as those pioneers put on the spacesuits and climb aboard the rockets, that we'll believe that even if they rise on the wings of the dawn, even if they go up to heavens, that even there His hand will guide them, and His right hand will hold them fast. And that'll be our prayer. Today, we mark the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11. We celebrate the heroic astronauts who accomplished that extraordinary feat in human history - and all those who supported them. And today, we resolve, for the sake of all they accomplished, that America will lead in space once again. And this nation will once again astonish the world with the heights we reach and the wonders we achieve. So may God bless the crew of Apollo 11 and all who supported them on their historic journey. May God bless this new generation of pioneers and all who will support them. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.",

         "HELLO, HELLO HELLO. GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL. PLEASE, PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEE IF YOU HAVE ONE. THANK YOU SO VERY, VERY MUCH. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK IN FLORIDA AND I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, CONGRESSWOMAN. SHE'S BEEN A TIRELESS , WHERE IS DEBBIE? THERE SHE IS. THANK YOU DEBBIE. YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND A LONG TIME AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE ENCOURAGEMENT. TOBY, I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU. TOBY MOVED FROM A HIGH RENT DISTRICT AND BROOKLYN COMES AT THE HIGHEST WITH DISTRICT IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW THESE DAYS. GOOD TO SEE YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT KIND INTRODUCTION. IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU TO HEAR THE STORIES COME TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THESE TOUGH TIMES, DIFFICULT TIMES. TODAY, TODAY'S STORY IS CERTAINLY ONE IN SOUTH FLORIDA. WE ARE ALL LIVING SOME VERSION OF IT RIGHT NOW WITH SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF OUR LIVES BEING PUT ON HOLD. THE SAME STORY BEING MOVED BY PEOPLE LIKE CARL WHO MANY OF YOU KNOW WELL. CARL IS HERE TODAY I'M TOLD. I DON'T KNOW , HEY, CARL. HOW WERE YOU, MAN? GOOD TO SEE HERE. LIGHT WAS SHINING LIGHT IN MY EYES LOOKING AT YOU, MAN. I APOLOGIZE. CARL IS 39 , NO, 93 WHEN HE ACTS LIKE HE'S 39 YEARS OLD. DOING SO MUCH IN THIS COMMITTEE, A FEW THANK YOU ALL DECIDED TO RENAME THIS COMMUNITY CENTER IN HIS HONOR. I'VE HEARD WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT YOU, , AND LOOK FORWARD TO SAY HELLO TO YOU PRIVATELY. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING CARL BACK IN 2012. HE MAY MAY NOT REMEMBER IT BUT HIS STORIES WITH HIS COMMUNITY AND THIS COUNTRY IS ALL ABOUT YOUR CARL IS A SIGN OF AN IMMIGRANT. CARL SERVED OUR NATION HONORABLY IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR, THAT IS SWEETHEART AND NEEDY, THE BEEN MARRIED NOW FOR 67 YEARS. TOGETHER THEY BUILT THE FAMILY, FOUR CHILDREN, SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN AND MORE THAN 30 YEARS THEY MADE THEIR HOME HERE, STAYING ENGAGED IN ALL THE LOCAL ISSUES. CATCHING SUNNY MATINEES AND PERFORMANCE AT THE ART CENTER AND THE CENTER, AND SOCIALIZING WITH NEIGHBORS AND TO JOIN NIGHTS IN THE TOWN AND A COUPLE TIMES, TO A THREE TIMES A WEEK GOING OUT. BUT THEIR STORY LIKE SO MANY OTHERS IS A A QUINTESSENTIAL AMERICAN STORY THESE DAYS. IT HAS BEEN INTERRUPTED THIS YEAR. CARL AND ANITA HAVE BEEN OUT I'M TOLD TO A IN SEVEN MONTHS AND THERE ARE NO MORE STANDING MATINEES OTHER THAN GETTING GROCERIES THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME IN THEIR APARTMENT LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE DO. IT'S HARDER THAN EVER TO SPEND TIME WITH THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE, OTHER THAN ON ZOOM OR ON A COMPUTER CONNECTION. WE HAVE ALL FELT THE SCENT OF INTERRUPTION IN OUR LIVES AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T NORMAL, THAT THINGS DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. WE LOOK AROUND AT OUR NEIGHBORS AND WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE HURTING. A LOT OF FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING THE NEXT RENT PAYMENT OR NEXT MORTGAGE PAYMENT. THEY ARE NOT ONLY, WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. WE SEALED OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE VERY TOP DOING BETTER THAN THEY HAVE EVER DONE, AND WONDER AN AWFUL LOT IS WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR ME? WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR ME? THAT'S BEEN THE STORY, THE ENTIRE STORY OF MY GIVE DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. THE FACT THAT HE HAS NEVER BEEN FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS. HE'S NEVER BEEN FOCUS ON YOU. HIS HANDLING OF THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN ERRATIC JUST LIKE HIS PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN. AND IT HAS PREVENTED FLORIDA SENIORS AND PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY FROM GIVING THE RELIEF THAT THEY NEED. DONALD TRUMP HAD NOT JUST BEEN WILLING TO NOT DO THE WORK. I THINK IT'S THAT JAN THAT I'M NOT SURE HE CARES ABOUT DELIVERING ANY REAL HELP. I THINK IT'S BOTH. PEOPLE SAFENET WILLING TO DO THE WORK. I DON'T THINK HE CARES MUCH ABOUT IT. WHILE WE ARE LOSING PRECIOUS TIME WITH YOUR LOVED ONES HE'S BEEN STUCK IN A SAND TRAP ON ONE OF HIS GOLF COURSES. AND WHEN HE DOES DECIDE TO LIFT A A FINGER IT ISN'T TO HELP YOU. IT'S TO PROPOSE NEW TAX CUTS FOR MILLIONAIRES. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. 100 WEALTHIEST BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA ARE EXPECTED TO GET ANOTHER $30 $30 BILLION TAX CUT HE IS PROPOSING. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME THAT TAX THAT WAS PASSED IN 2019, AFTER 2017 WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES GOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX BREAKS. AND THEN THEY TURNED AROUND AND RAISE RICES ARE MEDICINES THAT YOU RELY ON TO STAY HEALTHY. AND THEY ARE STILL DOING IT EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. QUITE FRANKLY IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE BUT TRUMP DOESN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT LOWERING THE HEALTHCARE COST BECAUSE HE IS BEHOLDEN TO HELP HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE DRUG COMPANIES. AFTER ALL, HE'S ASKING THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AS I SPEAK, ASKING RIGHT NOW TO STRIKE DOWN THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE SENIORS ABILITY, MOST OF YOU ARE ON MEDICARE, BUT IT WOULD ELIMINATE YOUR ABILITY IN THE ACT WE PASSED I WAS ABLE HELP PUT IN PLACE, WAS YOU HAVE PREVENTATIVE SERVICES, ANNUAL CHECKUPS AND MAMMOGRAMS FOR FREE UNDER MEDICARE. IF THEY GET STRUCK DOWN THAT GETS WIPED OUT AS WELL. THE RISING PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES FOR MANY SENIORS AND PUT MEDICARE TRUST FUND AT RISK. AND BY THE WAY, WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE MEDICARE TRUST FUND, I SEE THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO ELIMINATE IT BUT REMEMBER DEBBIE WILL REMEMBER, WHEN HE'S NOT A BAD GUY IN TERMS OF HIS PERSONALITY WHEN THE FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BECAME SPEAKER, , WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY PROPOSE HALF A BILLION DOLLARS CUT IN MEDICARE FROM THE START, RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THESE GUYS MEAN WHAT THEY SAY. THIS PRESIDENT , DEBBIE POINTED OUT, HE WANTS TO TERMINATE THE TAX, IS DEDICATED TO FINANCING SOURCES TO BECOME TERMINATE IT. SOCIAL SECURITY ACTUARY, NOT JOE BIDEN PORTABLE THINK TANK FOR A NEWSPAPER, THE ACTUARY, SOLSTICE COULD HE SAYS, THAT WOULD BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY IN JUST A FEW YEARS, PUTTING THOSE MONTHLY CHECKS FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF SENIORS WHO RELY ON, MANY OF THEM DO A THING TO RELY ON, AT RISK. ALL THIS PRESIDENT KNOWS HOW TO DO IS PLAY GAMES WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES AND FAMILIES FUTURES. LAST WEEK HE ANNOUNCED HE WAS QUOTE WALKING AWAY FROM THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WERE NEVER, INEVITABLY FULLY ENGAGE IN. HE NEVER FULLY ENGAGED WITH THEM. THEM. TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL RELIEF FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES. DEBBIE WORKING LIKE THE DOUBLE IN-HOUSE PASSED THE HEROES ACT. THEY PASSED TWO OF THE PIECES OF LEGISLATION EARLIER TO PROVIDE FOR THE ABILITY TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, PEOPLE BEING KICKED OUT OF THE HOMES. HE TURNED HIS BACK ON SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. HE TURNED HIS BACK ON FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS WHO DEPEND ON LOCAL BUDGETS BUT LOCAL BUDGETS ARE BEING BROKEN AND HAVE TO BE BALANCED. I WILL JUST TAKE, MAKE NO HERE. WHEN WE INHERITED THE LARGEST RECESSION, THE GREATEST RECESSION SINCE THE DEPRESSION, WHAT HAPPENED? PRESIDENT PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE RECOVERY ACT, $800 BILLION. FIRST THING I WAS ABLE TO DO WHEN I I WAS ABLE TO MANAGE IT MYSELF WAS THAT PUT $147 BILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES BE ABLE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS, NOT HAVE TO FIRE POLICE OFFICERS OR FIREFIGHTERS COME NOT FIRED FIRST RESPONDERS, NOT TOO CLOSE TO HEALTH CLINICS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR STRAIGHT TO THE BREAKING POINT TURKEY TURNED HIS BACK ON EDUCATORS AND SCHOOL CHILDREN, TOOK AWAY SUPPORT FROM PPE AND CLEANING SUPPLIES AND VENTILATION YOU TO REOPEN SCHOOL SAFETY WHICH WE COULD DO IF WE FUNDED IT. HE TURNS HIS BACK ON EVERY SINGLE WORKER WHOSE JOB HASN'T COME BACK. AND NOW HE SAYS HE WANTS A DEAL. ONE DAY HE'S TWEETING RELIEF PACKAGE IS TOO BIG, THE NEXT DAY SAYING IT'S TOO SMALL. IT'S ALL A GAME. HE THINKS HE IS STILL ON HIS GAME SHOW. NO, , REALLY, HE ASKED THAT WAY FOR REAL. THIS IS A FLUKE AGAIN HE IS PLAYING. HIS LATEST GIMMICK HE WANTS TO MAIL SENIORS AT $200 PRESCRIPTION DRUG CASH CARD WITH HIS NAME ON IT SO YOU GET IT BEFORE ELECTION WITH HIS NAME ON IT. BUT WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO IS HE'S GOING TO RAID MEDICARE TRUST FUND TO PAY FOR THAT $200 WHICH SENIORS HAVE ALREADY SPENT BY PAYING MONEY INTO. HE THINKS HE CAN TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKET WITH ONE HAND AND PUT IT BACK WITH HIS NAME STAMPED ON IT ON THE OTHER HAND. AND CALL IT A GIFT. IT'S DISHONEST. IT'S RECKLESS AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HELP ANYBODY. IN FACT, ALL IT DOES UNDERMINE THE MEDICARE TRUST FUND AND INCREASE OVERALL OUT-OF-POCKET COST FOR SENIORS. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS. DONALD TRUMP HAS TRIED FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS TO LOWER COME HE SAYS HE WANTS TO LOWER DRUG PRICES, OKAY? BUT HE HASN'T DONE A SINGLE THING TO DO IT. IN FACT, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED A BILL, DEBBIE SUPPORTED, THE BRINK OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS ACROSS THE BOARD GIVING MEDICARE THE POWER IN WASHINGTON THE POWER TO NEGOTIATE, TO NEGOTIATE TO THE DRUG COMPANIES AND SAY IF AN ASPEN IS GOING TO COST HIM BEING CHARGED, I'M MAKING THIS UP, IF AN ASPEN WILL COST TWO CENTS AN ASPEN, THEY SAY WILL ONLY PAY YOU A PENNY, THEY ARE EITHER GOING TO DO OR NOT. THEY WILL HAVE TO DO IT. WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO GET DEBBIE AND I AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO DO THIS FOR YEARS. WE LOWER DRUG PRICES. WHAT DID PRESIDENT TRUMP DO? HE SAID IF IT PASSES HE WILL VETO IT, THREATENED TO VETO IT. FOLKS, DONALD TRUMP'S CHAOTIC AND DECISIVE , DIVISIVE LEADERSHIP HAS COST US FAR TOO MUCH. 215,000 DEAD FROM COVID-19, AND RISING. EXPERTS SAY WE WILL LOSE NEARLY ANOTHER 200,000 LIVES IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS UNLESS HE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED COURSES. I PRAYED PRAY FOR HIS RECOVERY WHEN HE GOT COVID. I HOPE THAT WE COULD COME OUT OF IT, BUT WHAT IS HE DONE? HE HAS JUST DOUBLE DOWN ON MISINFORMATION HE DID BEFORE MAKING IT WORSE. SO MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT CARES MORE ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET THAN HE DOES ABOUT THE WELL-BEING OF SENIORS ONE DAY BEFORE RECROSS THE THRESHOLD OF 200,000 THIS, YOU MAY RECALL THIS, THE PRESIDENT WAS PRESIDENT WAS AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY AND INSISTED THAT THE VIRUS WAS, AND THE QUOTE, AFFECTS VIRTUALLY NOBODY QUOTE, JUST ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH HEART AND OTHER PROBLEMS. NOBODY, THINK ABOUT THAT. WHO WAS HE TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE SAID IT INFECTS VIRTUALLY NOBODY? HE IS TALKING ABOUT AMERICA'S SENIORS. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU, TALKING ABOUT MY FAMILY. YOU WORKED HARD TO WHOLE LIFE CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIETY, BUILDING A FAMILY, BUILDING THE COUNTRY, SERVING AMERICA. YOU DESERVE SECURITY, DESERVE RESPECT AND PEACE OF MIND BUT YOU ARE NOT GETTING IT. BY THE WAY, IF THIS WASN'T SO BIZARRE YOU WOULD THINK, IF I TRIED TO MAKE A MOVIE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN AMERICA YOU WOULD THINK I WAS MAKING IT UP. BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS SIMPLE, NON-JOE, YOU ARE EXPENDABLE. YOU ARE FORGETTABLE. YOU ARE VIRTUALLY NOBODY. THAT'S HOW HE SEES THIS. THAT'S HOW HE SEES YOU. IT'S NO SURPRISE, THIS IS THE SAME AND IT LOOKS IN THE MIRROR , PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE, CAUSING LOSERS AND SUCKERS. I CARRIED THIS CARD WITH ME EVERYDAY FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS, IT'S MY SCHEDULE. THE BACK OF THE SCHEDULE I HAVE BLACK BOX THAT SAYS DAILY TROOP UPDATE. THE NUMBER OF TROOPS WHO DIED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, 6924. 6924. ROUGHLY 6900. 924 BECAUSE OF YOU ONE OF THESE FALLEN ANGELS LEFT THE FAMILY BEHIND, DESERVES TO BE REMEMBERED. EVERYONE. U.S. TROOPS WOUNDED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, 53,000 AS OF TODAY. 194. EVERYONE. WITH ONLY ONE SACRED OBLIGATION IN AMERICA, TO CARE FOR THOSE WE SENT TO WAR AND EQUIP THEM WHEN THEY COME HOME TAKE CARE OF THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND WHAT DID HE SAY? LOSERS. MY SON VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. BEFORE THAT HE HAD BEEN IN KOSOVO FOR EIGHT MONTHS. BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THE ONLY FOREIGNER HAS A WAR MONUMENT AND A MAJOR HIGHWAY IN THAT COUNTRY NAMED AFTER HIM FOR HIS CONTRIBUTION TO HELP THEM SET UP THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEN HE VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO IRAQ AS ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR A YEAR. MY SON WAS NOT A LOSER. AND ALL THOSE LEFT BEHIND COME HE PASSED AWAY BUT ALL THOSE HE LEFT BEHIND, THEY ARE HEROES, THEY ARE PATRIOTS. I IMAGINE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON WHY SIX 4-STAR GENERAL AND A LOT OF OTHERS ENDORSE ME TO USE TO WORK FOR HIM BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHERE HIS HEART ISN'T. THAT'S HOW HE SEES US. THAT'S THE ATTITUDE HAS BROUGHT THROUGH THIS WHOLE CRISIS. THIS IS THE SAME MAN YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS TOLD WE WERE AVERAGING 1000 LIVES LOST PER DAY. REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID IT IS WHAT IT IS. SUCH CONCERN AND EMPATHY. IT IS WHAT IT IS. WELL, IT IS WHAT IT IS BECAUSE HE IS WHO HE IS. THAT'S WHY IT IS WHAT IT IS. THIS PRESIDENT AS DEBBIE REFERENCED, BACK IN JANUARY WHEN HE WAS BEING BRIEFED BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HE SAID I NEVER READ THE BRIEFING. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT. DIDN'T HAVE TIME. WELL, HIS EGO MOVED IN TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE FAMOUS JOURNALIST TO WRITE SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT HIM. WHAT HAPPENED? BOB WOODWARD INTERVIEWED HIM. HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE KNEW IT WAS A DANGEROUS AND HIGHLY COMMUNICABLE DISEASE, BUT HE DID NOTHING. HE DIDN'T DO A THING. HE DIDN'T TELL YOU. HE DIDN'T TELL ANY AMERICAN. WHY? HE TOLD WOODWARD ON TAPE, TOLD BOB WOODWARD HE DIDN'T WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. AMERICANS DON'T PANIC. TRUMP PANICS. HIS RECKLESS PERSONAL CONDUCT SINCE HIS DIAGNOSIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE. THE LONGER DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT THE MORE RECKLESSLY SEEMS TO GET. THANK GOD WILL HAVE THREE WEEKS LEFT TO GO TO DR. FAUCI, MOST RESPECTED DOCTOR IN THE COUNTRY ON THIS DISEASE, REFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE SUPREME COURT IN THE ROSE GARDEN USING THE WHITE HOUSE AS A BACKDROP FOR POLITICAL EVENTS, HE SAID IT WAS A SUPER SPREADER EVENT. AND HOW IS TRUMP RESPONDING? HE'S RUNNING A NATIONAL AD QUOTING DR. FAUCI OUT OF CONTEXT. WITHOUT YOU SAID WAY BACK IN MARCH, REFERRING TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ACROSS THE NATION, HE SAID, QUOTE, I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY COULD BE DOING MORE COME IN THE QUOTE MEANING PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. AT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL IT DOES I GOT A PIECE THE COMPANY TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS DELIBERATELY LIED. THEY HAVE PUT DR. FAUCI IN THEIR AD, ASSERTING THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT TRUMP WHEN HE SAID HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE ANY MORE. BUT HOW CHEAP IS A MAN OF INTEGRITY , BUT DR. FAUCI IS MEANT OF INTEGRITY. AFTER THE AD CAME OUT HE SAID I I DID NOT GIVE PERMISSION TO USE THAT QUOTE AND I WASN'T REFERRING TO THE PRESIDENT. EVEN AFTER DR. FAUCI SAID THAT COME HE DIDN'T SAY THAT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. TRUMP AD CAMPAIGN SAID THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO USE THE ADD, KNOWING, KNOWING IT WAS A LIE. CAN ANY OF YOU EVER REMEMBER ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE PRESIDENT TO CAMPAIGN THE MAINSTREAM CANDIDATE, AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THE MONTHS OF LIFE, MISLEADING AND RESPONSIBLE ACTION A PART OF DONALD TRUMP, HOW MANY INTO CHAIRS AROUND THE DINING ROOM TABLE TONIGHT BECAUSE OF HIS NEGLIGENCE? HOW MANY PEOPLE HEARTS ARE BROKEN? HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE GOING TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, CAN'T JUST REACH OVER AND TOUCH? THEY CAN HEAR THEIR SONS OR DAUGHTERS VOICE ON THE PHONE. WELL, HE THROWS SUPER SPREADER PARTIES AT THE WHITE HOUSE, REPUBLICANS HELD EACH OTHER WITHOUT CONCERN OF THE CONSEQUENCES. HOW MANY OF YOU BEEN UNABLE TO HUG YOUR GRANDKIDS IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS? I GOT SIX OF THEM. TWO HAVE BEEN BEEN MY DECEASED SONS BOYS, CHILDREN, , A BOY AND GIRL, LIVE NOT FAR FROM IT. BILLY RAY CONCEDED, I STAND ON THE BACK PORCH AND A STANDDOWN AND I BRIBE THEM WITH HAAGEN-DAZS BARS. BUT EVERY SINGLE DAY I CONTACT THEM. I CAN'T HUG THEM. I CAN'T EMBRACE THEM. AND I'M LUCKIER THAN MOST BECAUSE THE ARE NEARBY, THOSE TWO OF THE SIX. MY GRANDKIDS, YOUR GRANDKIDS, HOPE WILL GROW TO TREAT ONE OF THE AS KINDNESS, RESPECT AND EMPATHY. QUALITIES THE PRESIDENT HAS NEVER EVER SHOWN. IT HAS BECOME PAINFULLY CLEAR AS CARELESS RESPONSE HAS CAUSED ONE OF THE WORST TRAGEDIES IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THE ONLY SENIOR THAT DONALD TRUMP CARES ABOUT, THE ONLY SENIOR IS SENIOR DONALD TRUMP. DOESN'T SEEM TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIM. AND BY THE WAY, MINORITY COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING PARTICULARLY HIT BY THIS. WE REALIZE AS OF ABOUT A MONTH AGO, ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS ONE IN 1000 AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN ALL OF AMERICA HAVE DIED. THE ESTIMATE IS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR ONE IN 500 AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND AMERICAN WILL DIE. ONE IN 500. IF HE DOESN'T DO SOMETHING QUICKLY AND WE HIT 400,000, THAT IS MORE PEOPLE, SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT DIED, 400,000 DEAD, THEN WORLD WAR II. IN LESS THAN A YEAR IF HE DOESN'T MOVE. THE ONLY ONE DOUBLE TROUBLE DO ANYTHING FOR HIS DONALD TRUMP. LOOK, FOLKS, YOU ALL KNOW THIS. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE CAN CONTAIN THIS VIRUS. WE CAN FULLY REOPEN OUR ECONOMY WE CAN BRING CONGRESS TOGETHER TO PASS REAL RELIEF AND IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA TO BUILD BACK BETTER. MY ECONOMIC PROPOSAL, AND BY THE WAY IT'S NOT A LIBERAL THINK TANK FOR DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK THAT SAYS THIS. AND IF THE ANALYSIS PUT OUT MY MOOD IS, A WALL STREET FIRM, PROJECTS THAT MY ECONOMIC PLAN WILL CREATE 18.6 MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS BETWEEN NOW AND IN THE FIRST TERM. 7 MILLION MORE JOBS THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN, AND CREATE A TRULY MORE DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. IT'S SOLID, IT'S REAL. HERE'S HOW MY PLAN WORKS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON A SINGLE SOLITARY AMERICAN MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. WILL NOT PAY A PENNY MORE, IT SECURITY. I'M GOING AS BIG CORPORATIONS AND WEALTHY TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE TAX STRUCTURE. THAT MONEY WILL ALLOW US TO INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE WHO CARRY WITH IT I DON'T KNOW IF IT WITH ME NOW, I DON'T, A CARD THAT LISTS ALL OF WHAT IS IN THE TAX CODE. WE WENT AHEAD, PRESIDENT'S TAX PLAN, BARACK AND I'M SUGGESTING WE REDUCED CORPORATE TAX FROM 35% TO 28. 28. I WAS A CONSENSUS. HE REDUCED IT TO 21 DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE COST? $1.3 TRILLION. WE JUST TAKE IT BACK UP TO 28 AND IT WILL GENERATE $1.3 TRILLION MORE. .. CUT THE TAX AND 35 TO 21. THE SENATE RACING BACK TO 28%. $1.3 TRILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE INSTEAD OF DOING BIG CORPORATIONS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS FOR BUYBACK IN THEIR OWN STOCK, MOVING OVERSEAS, WE SHOULD INVEST IN CANCER, DIABETES, ALL LEVERS AND PARKINSON'S I PROPOSE GIVING NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH $50 BILLION OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, CANCER, DIABETES, OLD-TIMERS AND PARKINSON'S. IF WE DO NOT FIND AN ANSWER TO ALZHEIMER'S WITHIN THE NEXT 19 YEARS, EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY BED THAT EXISTS IN THE U.S. NOW WILL BE OCCUPIED BY OLD-TIMERS PATIENTS. MY DAD USED TO HAVE THIS EXPRESSION, JOE, IF EVERYTHING IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU, NOTHING IS IMPORTANT. WHERE OUR PRIORITIES? OUR PRIORITIES ARE TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IN AMERICA HAS AN EQUAL SHOT. IT'S ABOUT YOU, WHAT'S FAIR, ABOUT WHAT OUR PRIORITIES SHOULD BE WE CAN DEAL WITH CANCER IN THESE OTHER DISEASES BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS NO INTEREST. HE WANTS TO DO THE OPPOSITE. PROPOSES MORE TAX CUTS. DONALD TRUMP, EASE THE BURDEN ON MAJOR COSTS IN YOUR LIFE INCLUDING A FINANCIAL BURDEN IN CAREGIVING FOR MANY FAMILIES WITHOUT CARING. RIGHT NOW, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, 800,000 AMERICANS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HOME COMMUNITY CARE, SIGNED UP FOR, AN AVERAGE OF FIVE YEARS WAITING. FOR SOME, FIVE YEARS, MY PLAN MAKES INVESTMENTS SO THE STATE CAN CLEAR THE WAITING LIST. THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO ALLOW MEDICAID TO AGAIN USE IT NORMA'S PARTY AND NEGOTIATE PRICES AND BRING THE COST DOWN FOR EVERYONE. GIVING ALL AMERICANS ACCESS THEY ALSO HATE MY DOING, SO DO THE DRUG COMPANIES. THE EXPERTS TO SET PRICES, LIFE-SAVING DRUGS THAT COST AN ARM AND A LEG FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY. THEY HAVE NO COMPETITION, THE BOARD WAS SET UP AND SAY THIS IS HOW MUCH YOU BEEN CHARGED BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE INVESTED, WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE THE PRICE OF THE DRUG WITHOUT TAKING OTHER ACTION THAT HAS REQUIRED YOU TO IMPROVE THE DRUG. IT CAN ONLY BE RAISED WITH MEDICAL INFLATION. INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS FOUND MY LAND/COST BY 60%. HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S HAD TO SELL THINGS JUST TO GET THE DRUGS HAVE GROWN UP EXPONENTIALLY? WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND INCREASED BENEFITS FOR MILLIONS OF SENIORS TO PROTECT YOUR PENSION INCLUDING PENSIONS, SO MANY FLORIDIANS EARN AND DESERVE. FOLKS, I WILL END WITH THIS, I AM CONFIDENT AS BAD AS THINGS ARE, HOW CAN I GET BETTER? I AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT WE CAN DO THIS AND MORE. WE JUST HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. A PROUD DEMOCRAT AND WILLING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. GOING TO WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO VOTE AGAINST ME AS THOSE WHO VOTED FOR ME. THAT IS THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT PRESIDENT. A DUTY TO CARE, TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, ALL AMERICA HAS ACCOMPLISHED, ALL THE YEARS WE SERVE AS A BEACON TO THE WORLD, WE CANNOT LET OURSELVES REMAIN DIVIDED. WE HAVE TO VOTE. GO TO I WILL VOTE.COM/FL. CAN STILL REQUEST YOUR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. DEADLINE IS OCTOBER 24. REQUEST YOUR BALLOT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY, MAIL IT OR DROP IT IN A DROP BOX TODAY AND TIRED OF US ALL WALKING AROUND WITH OUR HEADS DOWN AS IF THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY, NOTHING WE'VE EVER DECIDED TO DO, IS NOT ACCOMPLISHED. WE'VE DONE TOGETHER. REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE KIDS, YOU HAD TO LEARN ABOUT JOHN KENNEDY GOING TO THE MOON, EVERYBODY REMEMBERS THE DIFFERENT PIECES OF IT. THEY USED TO KIDNEY IN THE SENATE WHAT I WAS THE. ANSWERING THE UNASKED QUESTION, WHY WAS HE DOING? HE SAID BECAUSE WE REFUSED TO POSTPONE. REFUSED TO POSTPONE ONE MORE DAY WITHIN OUR CAPACITY AS AMERICANS AMERICANS, THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. NO LIMIT TO OUR FUTURE. WE GOT TO STAND UP, LIFT OUR HEADS UP THE ONLY THING THAT CAN AMERICA IS A AMERICA ITSELF. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID. WHO WE ARE, WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. SIGNS OVER FICTION. YET, TRUTH OVER LIVES. WE CAN DO THIS AND I PROMISE YOU YOU, MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANKS. EVERY TIME I USED TO WALK OUT OF MY GRANDPA'S IN PENNSYLVANIA, HE WOULD YELL JOEY, KEEP THE FAITH AND MY GRANDMA SAID NO JOEY, SPREAD IT. THANKS, EVERYBODY.",

         "GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. LAST WEEK, I HAD THE HONOR OF SPEAKING TO ALL OF YOU FROM PHILADELPHIA. THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENTS OF OUR DEMOCRACY. TONIGHT IN KEEPING WITH THE LATEST GUIDANCE FROM THE CDC, TO AVOID GATHERINGS OF MORE THAN 10 PEOPLE, I'M SPEAKING TO YOU FROM MY HOME IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. I HOPE ALL OF YOU ARE STAYING SAFE. TALKING AND TAKING THE RECOMMENDED PRECAUTIONS AND TALKING IT TO THE DOCTORS IF YOU HAVE ONE, TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. SLOW THE SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS. THIS PANDEMIC HAS IMPACTED EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES. AND EVERY ASPECT OF THIS CAMPAIGN. MOST OF ALL, MY HEART GOES OUT TO ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE. THOSE WHO CONTRACTED THE VIRUS. ALL OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS WORKING HARDER THAN EVER TO HELP THEIR NEIGHBORS. TO HELP THOSE CHILDREN AT HOME OR SCHOOL AND ARE WORRIED AND DON'T KNOW WHY. DOCTORS, NURSES, EMTS, PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS, AS WELL AS FRONT-LINE EMERGENCY WORKERS LIKE FIREFIGHTERS AND DEDICATED FOLKS WORKING TO KEEP SHELVES STOCKED IN THE GROCERY STORES. TACKLING THIS PANDEMIC IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY, LOOK INTO FIGHTING A WAR. IT WILL REQUIRE LEADERSHIP AND COOPERATION FROM EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. IT WILL REQUIRE US TO MOVE THOUGHTFULLY AND DECISIVELY TO QUICKLY ADDRESS BOTH THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT WILL REQUIRE US TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC HEALTH EXPERTS. IT WILL REQUIRE EACH OF US TO DO OUR PART. YES, THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE WE NEED OUR LEADERS TO LEAD, BUT ALSO A MOMENT WHERE THE CHOICES AND DECISIONS WE MAKE AS INDIVIDUALS WILL COLLECTIVELY IMPACT WHAT HAPPENS. MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE SEVERITY OF THIS OUTBREAK AND PREPARING OUR MEDICAL SYSTEMS TO HANDLE IT. I KNOW WE AS A PEOPLE ARE UP TO THIS CHALLENGE, WE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. WE WILL ANSWER THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS WITH THE BEST WE FIND IN ALL OF US. THAT'S WHAT AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE AND WHAT WE DO. THAT'S WHO WE ARE. ORDINARY PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WHEN THE NEED ARISES. TODAY, WE ARE MOVING QUICKLY TO ATTRACT OUR ROUTINES TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE. AMERICANS IN THREE STRAIGHT , STATES WENT TO THE POLLS. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND POLL WORKERS WHO WORKED WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES TO SHARE SAFE OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOTING. MAKING SURE THE VOTERS CAN CAST THEIR BALLOTS WHILE MAINTAINING A DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER THAT WAS SAFE. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET THROUGH THIS CRISIS, PROTECTING BOTH PUBLIC HEALTH AND DEMOCRACY. TODAY, IT LOOKS LIKE ONCE AGAIN IN FLORIDA AND ILLINOIS, WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM ARIZONA, OUR CAMPAIGN HAS A GOOD NIGHT. WE MOVE CLOSER TO SECURING THE NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT. WE ARE DOING IT BY DOING A BROAD COALITION. WE NEED TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. WITH STRONG SUPPORT TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, LATINO COMMUNITY, HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATED FOLKS I GREW UP WITH IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD. TEACHERS, SUBURBAN WOMEN, VETERANS, FIREFIGHTERS, AND SO MANY MORE. WE ARE DOING IT WITH A COMMON VISION. SENATOR SANDERS AND I MAY DISAGREE ON TACTICS, BUT WE SHARE A COMMON VISION. FOR THE NEED TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS, REDUCING COMMON EQUITY THAT HAS RISEN SO DRASTICALLY, TO TACKLING THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF OUR TIME, CLIMATE CHANGE. SENATOR SANDERS AND HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE BROUGHT A REMARKABLE TENACITY TO ALL OF THESE ISSUES. TOGETHER, THEY SHIFTED THE FUNDAMENTAL CONVERSATION IN THIS COUNTRY. LET ME SAY ESPECIALLY TO THE YOUNG VOTERS INSPIRED BY SENATOR SANDERS, I HEAR YOU. I KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE, I KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. OUR GOAL IS TO CAMPAIGN, AND MY GOAL IS TO UNIFY THIS PARTY AND UNIFY THE NATION. IT'S A MOMENT LIKE THESE WERE WE REALIZE WE NEED TO PUT POLITICS INSIDE , ASIDE. THE CORONAVIRUS DOESN'T CARE IF YOU'RE DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. IT WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON NATIONAL ORIGIN, RACE, GENDER, OR YOUR ZIP CODE. IT WILL TOUCH PEOPLE OF POSITIONS OF POWER. THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY. WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER. THIS IS FOR EACH OF US TO SEE AND BELIEVE THE BEST AND EVERY ONE OF US. TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR NEIGHBOR. UNDERSTAND THE FEAR AND STRESS SO MANY ARE FEELING TO CARE FOR THE ELDERLY. THE ELDERLY COUPLE DOWN THE STREET, TO THINK THE HEALTH CARE WORKER, DOCTORS, NURSES, PHARMACISTS. THE GROCERY STORE CASHIER AND PEOPLE RESTOCKING THE SHELVES. TO BELIEVE IN ONE ANOTHER. BECAUSE I ASSURE YOU, WHEN WE SEE THE BEST IN EACH OF US, WE LIFT THIS NATION UP, WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. THAT'S HOW WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT. GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND MY SPECIAL PRAYER FOR THOSE OF YOU ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE CRISIS. DOCTORS, NURSES, HEALTH-CARE WORKERS, CARING FOR THE VIRUS VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILY. MY PRAYERS ARE GOING OUT FOR EVERYONE. MY HOPES ARE HIGH, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN TIMES OF CRISIS, AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS STEPPED UP. WE HAVE TO STEP UP AND CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER.

         "Thank you, President Towey. Thank you for , thank you for your kindness. Thank you for your friendship. I actually gave him a ride on Air Force Two just so he could make it back for this event. (Laughter.) Give a big round of applause for a man that's made an incredible difference in the life of this university , Jim Towey. (Applause.) Truly a servant leader and a humble man, and a great, great friend to everything that we cherish. Thank you all for that wonderful, warm welcome. I will tell you that that introduction was gracious and kind, but Jim knows the one I prefer is even shorter: I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order, and it's an honor to be with all of you today. (Applause.) To Chairman Timmis, to the Board of Trustees, distinguished members of the faculty, to the students of this remarkable school: It is an honor here to join you in this place, founded in fidelity to Christ, Ave Maria University. Give yourselves a round of applause. (Applause.) A special place. And allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine and a great friend of the state of Florida, of this great university, and a champion of people of faith across this country and around the world. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, as the President said at the National Prayer Breakfast earlier this year, in his words, 'Since the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides , from gaining independence, to abolition, to civil rights have been led by people of faith and started prayer.' And I'm here, first and foremost, to thank the entire community here at Ave Maria University for the critical work you do to educate America's next generation of leaders, public servants, and leaders in faith all across America. Give this faculty a round of applause, will you, please? (Applause.) And as I just learned during a tour of your museum, Ave Maria instills a strong sense of responsibility and compassion, mission and self-sacrifice, in its students through its first-of-its-kind program in the world, the Mother Teresa Project. It's truly inspiring. In this academic year alone, I learned that students in the Mother Teresa Project have volunteered thousands of hours with Habitat for Humanity in local schools, in nursing homes, and in missions across the globe , from Mexico, to Uganda, to India. So thank you for putting feet on your faith, impacting this community, this state, our nation, and the world. We're proud of all of you. (Applause.) And through it all, you've carried forth the values that we share, and chief among them, the men and women of Ave Maria University have stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.) You know, I've long believed that a society can be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable: the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn. And I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside the most pro-life President in American history, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The record speaks for itself. In one of his first acts as President, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, preventing taxpayer dollars from funding abortion or abortion providers around the world. And we recently expanded that policy just in the past few days. Here at home, President Trump signed a law making it possible for all 50 states to defund Planned Parenthood. (Applause.) The truth is , and I see it in the shining faces here at Ave Maria University , life is winning in America. Particularly more and more young people across this country are embracing the sanctity of life. But for all the progress we're making at the very moment that more Americans than ever before are embracing the sanctity of life, the truth is: Leading members of the Democratic Party across this country are embracing a radical agenda of abortion on demand. You've seen it in the newspapers. In state legislatures across the country, Democrats have endorsed late-term abortion. In fact, the Governor of Virginia openly defended infanticide just a few short weeks ago. And Democrats in the United States Senate , and you deserve to know , including every Democrat senator running for President voted, against a bill that would protect children who had been born alive. The truth is, with Democrats standing for late-term abortion, infanticide, and a culture of death, I promise you this President, our party, and this movement will always stand for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.) Just like Ave Maria did, not long ago, it was just a few years ago when Ave Maria didn't bow to the dictates of the last administration. This university stood strong for conscience and values. Ave Maria spoke out against the last administration's attempt to force employers to provide health insurance plans that violated pro-life principles within Obamacare. And not only did Ave Maria University refuse to comply with that mandate, you challenged it and you won. (Applause.) And we commend you for your stand. And President Trump promised to stand with you , and we did , and all of those struggling under that HHS mandate, which is why we created a religious and moral exemption to the federal rule, so that all Americans can live out their faith freely in the healthcare system of this country. (Applause.) You know, the truth is, Obamacare restricted freedom, and it's reduced choices. And Obamacare has failed. And American families and businesses are still paying the price. We all remember the broken promises of Obamacare. They told us if you liked your doctor, you could keep your doctor; if you liked your health plan, you could keep it; that if Obamacare passed, health insurance premiums would go down. But unfortunately, none of that was true. Costs have skyrocketed. Premiums on the individual market rose by more than 100 percent. Choices have plummeted. And more and more insurance companies have pulled out of the marketplace entirely. And as Obamacare fails, you deserve to know that Democrats are continuing in their quest for a government takeover of healthcare. They're opening calling for socialized medicine under the guise of Medicare for All. Well, the truth of the matter is, Medicare for All means quality healthcare for none. Socialized medicine will lead our country to ration healthcare and to government bureaucrats making the most important decisions affecting our lives and the lives of our loved ones. But as President Trump said just recently, soon the Republican Party will become known as the 'Party of Healthcare.' And we're going to have a great healthcare plan for all of the American people. (Applause.) This week, the President took a decisive step to repeal and replace Obamacare. And I want to promise you: We will never give up, we will never relent, in our effort to put American healthcare back on the path to more choices, more affordability, built on the principles of freedom and the doctor-patient relationship. That's our pledge to each of you in this rising generation. And let me assure all of you here in the Ave Maria community: You also have an ally and a champion in President Trump when it comes to our core freedoms. We will always stand with you, as we will always stand with all those who share our values. We will always defend your fundamental right to freedom. As we all learned from our youth, the United States was forged in religious freedom. Our first settlers were pilgrims who left everything and set sail for a New World; carved out a new home in the wilderness where they could practice their faith freely and without fear of persecution. And after this great nation secured our independence, the American Founders enshrined that first freedom in our First Amendment with these words: that 'Congress shall make no law respecting establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' Our Founders knew that this precious liberty was not granted by government and could not be granted by government. They knew, as we know today, that we are 'endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.' And the truth is, as I stand before you today, freedom of religion is increasingly under attack here at home. Lately, it's actually become fashionable for media elites and Hollywood liberals to mock religious belief. My own family became the target of these attacks after my wife went back to teach art at a Christian school. So let me say from my heart , not for us, but for every believer in this country: These attacks on believing Christians and Christian education are wrong, and they must stop. (Applause.) They're antithetical to our great American tradition. And, frankly, they should be rejected by every American of every faith. Now, I'm proud to say, since day one of this administration, President Trump has taken bold action to protect religious liberty and the freedom of conscience of every American of every faith tradition. In our first year, the President declared, in his words, that the 'federal government will never, ever penalize any person for their protected religious beliefs,' and he directed the Department of Justice to develop new protections for Americans of faith. We made sure the free exercise of religion doesn't stop at the doors of our churches or houses of worship when we suspended enforcement of the Johnson Amendment and we freed up the voices of religious leaders all over the country. (Applause.) Just last week, President Trump signed an executive order, as well, to ensure that America's First Amendment protections extend to every college and university campus in America. (Applause.) And I want to promise you: Wherever your countries take you from here, Ave Maria University, we will always stand with thoughtful young men and women like you across this country who deserve to live out your faith, live out your values without repercussions or persecution. There should be no 'safe zones' from the God-given liberties of the American people. And we will stand for the freedom of speech, the freedom of expression on every campus in America. (Applause.) Now, as we defend liberty here at home, our administration has been standing strong for freedom around the world. And nowhere is that more true than in the stand that we've taken for freedom and democracy in Venezuela. Let me take this opportunity to thank a local leader, who's a national leader. He's been a champion of freedom in this hemisphere and a champion of restoring freedom and liberty and democracy for the Venezuelan people. Would you join me in thanking Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart for his outstanding leadership for freedom? (Applause.) He's been a great champion, along with both of your senators, for the restoration of freedom in Venezuela. And, Mario, we're proud and grateful , grateful for your heart for libertad. You know, the truth is Venezuela was once one of the richest and most vibrant democracies in the Western Hemisphere. By some estimates, Venezuela actually is home to the largest oil reserves in the world. But under the brutal regime of the dictator Nicolas Maduro and his socialist rule, it's become one of the poorest and most despotic countries in the world. Today, 9 out of 10 Venezuelans live in poverty. More than 3 million people have already abandoned their homes and fled the brutality of the Maduro regime. I was recently in Colombia and met with families who had fled not just the oppression but the starvation that's facing millions in that once rich country. It was heartbreaking, a story that I heard in my first trip to Colombia, of a grandmother who had gathered up her five grandchildren and made the long march across Venezuela to the Colombia border two years ago, because she said it had gotten so bad in her village that her grandchildren had to rise at four in the morning to get a ticket that they could exchange for a single piece of bread at four in the afternoon. And I'm proud to say, since early in this administration, with the strong support of leaders in Congress, President Trump has led an effort to isolate the dictator Maduro through economic and diplomatic means. The United States was proud to be the first nation on Earth to recognize Interim President Juan Guaid� as the rightful President of Venezuela. And now, more than 50 nations have joined us. (Applause.) Yesterday, President Trump and I met at the White House with Fabiana, the wife of Juan Guaid�. She's 26 years old , a young woman of extraordinary courage and grace. She'll meet today with our First Lady, Melania Trump, here in Florida. We told her then, in the Oval Office of the White House, the United States will continue to stand with her, with President Guaid�, and with the people of Venezuela until their libertad and democracy is restored. (Applause.) So we've been standing for freedom. For, as many of you have seen firsthand on your mission trips around the world, religious liberty is also under attack. Today, tragically, 82 percent of the world's people live in nations where religious freedom is either threatened or banned outright. The list of religious freedom violators is long. Their crimes and oppression span the width and breadth of our globe. Here in our own hemisphere, the government of Daniel Ortega is virtually waging war on the Nicaraguan Catholic Church. Government-backed mobs armed with machetes and even heavy weapons have attacked parishes and churches. Bishops and priests have been physically assaulted by their secret police. And hundreds of courageous Nicaraguans have died in the cause of freedom in the last year alone. I'll never forget the day I met one of those parish priests at a conference at the State Department. He talked about the siege of their church and how young people had come in to take shelter, and that when it was all over and the violence had ended and they left, he walked up to me and he said there was a young man in the group who described himself as an atheist. But as they were walking out of the church, he walked up to that courageous priest; he had seen his faith in action. He had seen him pray under a hail of gunfire; put himself in harm's way to protect the other young people there. And he said, that young man who said he was an atheist , said, and I quote , he said, 'Father, I don't believe in God. But if I ever believe in God, I'm going to believe in your God.' That's faith. That's courage in action. And we will stand for freedom for the people of Nicaragua, and we will stand with the people of faith in that nation. (Applause.) Farther from home, but close to our hearts, the world watched in horror earlier this month as a terrorist murdered 50 innocent Muslims at prayer in New Zealand. It was a horrific sight, and our hearts and our prayers went out and go out to every member of the community that was affected and the people of New Zealand. No one should ever fear for their safety in a place of worship , be that a mosque, or a church, or a synagogue , anywhere in the world. (Applause.) The hateful animus that motivated that killer is to be condemned universally around the world. And all of us are also witnessing the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism. It's rearing its ugly head , from Iran, to Europe, even in the halls Congress. Let me be clear on this: Anti-Semitism is not just wrong; it's evil. And anti-Semitism, like every form of racism, must be confronted wherever and whenever it arises, and it must be universally condemned. (Applause.) The truth is, nowhere have people of faith faced greater threats than in the ancient lands where the world's three great religions were born across the Middle East. Since 2014, the brutal regime of ISIS murdered thousands of Christians and forced hundreds of thousands of them to flee their homes. And it's not just Christians. Believers of many other faiths have suffered grievously at ISIS's hands, including Muslims, Druze, and Yazidis. I met this week with the Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament in my office, and we spoke of the barbarous reign of ISIS in its time and how they particularly targeted religious minorities and Christians. The good news is, President Trump promised to destroy the ISIS caliphate. And thanks to the courage of our armed forces and this Commander-in-Chief, America and our allies delivered. The ISIS caliphate is no more. (Applause.) As the world learned just last weekend, the last inch of control of the ISIS caliphate was captured by American forces and by our allies in the region. And while we've liberated millions of religious minorities and captive Christians across the Middle East from the grip of ISIS, I'm proud to tell you that we've also been helping persecuted communities rebuild their communities and their lives, and replant their roots in their ancestral homes so destroyed by war. At President Trump's direction, for the first time ever, the United States of America is providing direct support to Christians and religious minorities in the Middle East to rebuild their communities. (Applause.) As I stand before you today, we've already committed more than $340 million in aid. And, I'm proud to say, we're continuing to work with a strong range of nongovernmental organizations , NGOs, as they are known , including the great ministry of the Knights of Columbus. (Applause.) We're going to rebuild these communities. We're going to work with our partners across the Nineveh Plain, Iraq, the Kurdish region of Iraq. And we're going to see these communities come home. Religious persecution is also growing in the world's most populous nation: China. The State Department's annual International Religious Freedom report has labeled China as a religious freedom violator every year since 1999. As we stand here today, Beijing is holding possibly millions of Muslim Uighurs in so-called 're-education camps' in Western China. Chinese authorities have banned the sale of Christian Bibles. They've destroyed thousands of crosses and other church symbols. And they've jailed pastors. Even now, the Chinese government is using the power of cutting-edge technology to develop large-scale systems of surveillance to track its citizens , an effort that our Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Freedom, Sam Brownback, called 'the future of repression.' These are historic human rights abuses, and I want to promise all of you: Our administration is going to continue to stand strong and speak out and work to convince China that these practices are abhorrent and they should be stopped. (Applause.) But despite the heavy hand of that government, the good news is, the good news is spreading. (Laughter.) And the truth is, nowhere in its history has the Church grown as quickly as it's growing in China. Seventy years ago, when the Communist Party took power, there were less than half a million Chinese Christians. Today, just two generations later, some estimate that there are 130 Christians living throughout China, proving once again what's been true throughout the history of the Church: When persecution comes, faith grows. Persecuted Christians around the world deserve our prayers. And they will always have the support of the American people. (Applause.) As you venture out on mission trips, know that our administration will always continue to stand for liberty and religious liberty throughout the wider world. You know, it really is an honor to be with all of you , these incredible, bright shining faces here at Ave Maria University. Just think of me as a warm-up act for commencement in five weeks. (Laughter.) But I'm here to tell you this is a serious time in the life of our nation. And to stand before such impressive young men and women, it's a great honor for me and it's a privilege. The truth is, in the next 19 months, America will face a choice. And the challenge before us is not just about winning an election; we must win the next generation. And that's where you all come in. Your faith, your integrity, your character , all of which the foundation has been strengthened here at Ave Maria University , will make you leaders in the rising generation. You'll stand out. So I want to offer you a challenge: What you've seen and heard and learned in the hallways of this still-young university, carry from here as you lead lives of consequence in your generation. Live out your faith. Live out your values. 'Always be prepared,' as the Bible tells us, 'to give a reason for the hope that you have, but do so with gentleness and respect.' On my way here, on Air Force Two, I was reading in my morning devotions the story of the farmer that went out to sow seed in Luke, Chapter 8. The story reads, 'The seed that fell on good soil, it yielded a crop 100 times more than was sown.' And I stand before this impressive group of young people, and those looking on, to say that's what you must aspire to be. It's interesting that Jesus later pulled aside his disciples and explained to them what the meaning of the parable was and how it had to do with the character of the men and women. He said, and I quote, 'The seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and, by persevering, produce a crop.'So I want to challenge each one of you to act on those words in your life. First, be hearers of the word. You know, it's always struck me that Psalm 1, Psalm 19, and Psalm 119 , the first Psalm and the longest Psalm , all have to do with one idea, and that is: Read the word. Take time in your life. Blessed is a man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners, or sit in the seat of mockers, but what? His delight is in the law of the Lord, and on His law he meditates day and night, and be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he or she does prospers. What a promise. So I'd just encourage you, as a fellow believer: Hear it, retain it, live it out as best you can, and persevere. I don't know if you caught that in the verse, but it said, by 'persevering' it produced a crop. And the truth is, those of you who are willing to stand for faith and values in this rising generation, you're going to face criticism and what passes in this country for persecution. That's where your perseverance comes in, to turn your face like flint against the wind, and smile and show that conviction and show that love to everybody that you meet. You know, I'll always believe the essence of leadership is what's in your heart. People follow people that they trust. And when you know somebody's heart, you trust them. So let people see your heart and persevere. Now, my favorite President is the one I go to work with every day. (Laughter.) But one of my other favorites was Calvin Coolidge, who had some words about perseverance that I've actually got tacked to the bulletin board in our office at the Vice President's Residence, and they're really words to live by. Calvin Coolidge was a man of faith. He was also a Vice President. (Laughter.) He'd been a governor. (Laughter.) But I digress. (Laughter.) Calvin Coolidge said, and I quote, 'Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On!' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.' So I encourage you to press on and know that you can make a difference. Be men and women with good and noble hearts. Store up God's word in those hearts. Retain it and preserve. And remember the words I read a little bit later in Luke, Chapter 8, as well. There's a reason you're here. There's a reason all of you have been blessed with an education of this magnitude with such a solid foundation and timeless values, and to the ideals that have made this country great. I think it can be found in the rest of that chapter to remember no one , 'No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar and puts it under a bed. Instead he puts it on a stand so that those who come in can see .' When you leave here and you leave Ave Maria University, let your light shine. You'll make a difference in the life of this nation and in the world. So thank you for the honor of addressing all of you today. The future beckons, and I believe it will be a future where we , with men and women in this rising generation, where we recommit ourselves to all the ideals that have always made this country strong and prosperous and secure and free. It's going to be a foundation forged on our most cherished institutions of faith and family and freedom. I believe it with all my heart. I see it happening all over the country, everywhere I go. And as you do that, as you step out as leaders, I just saw, a few moments ago, one last admonition from Mother Teresa, and I'm going to take it back with me. She said, 'At the end of life, we will not be judged by how many diplomas we've received, how much money we've made, how many great things we have done. We will be judged by 'I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was naked, and you clothed me. I was homeless, and you took me in.' Be men and women of compassion, men and women of conviction. Be men and women who are leading in this generation. And I know that, as you live out that high calling , with your example, with your lives of consequence, with great institutions like Ave Maria University, with strong leaders elected at every level around the country who share our values, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God's help , I know we're just getting started. And we will make America great again. Thank you all very much. (Applause.) God bless you. And God bless America.",

MY FOLKS ARE PREACHERS AND THEY CLEARLY READ THE BIBLE, BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY. I'M THE FIRST GRADUATE OF A FOUR-YEAR INSTITUTION IN MY FAMILY. MOREHOUSE COLLEGE. I GOT THERE THROUGH HARD WORK, GRIT AND DETERMINATION. BUT I GOT THERE BECAUSE SOMEBODY GAVE ME SOME PELL GRANTS AND SOME LOW-INTEREST STUDENT LOANS. AND I'M RUNNING BECAUSE IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR KIDS GROWING UP IN STRUGGLING FAMILIES THAN IT WAS FOR ME ALL OF THOSE YEARS AGO. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME, YOU SEE AN ITERATION AND AN EXAMPLE OF THE AMERICAN STORY. BECAUSE I GREW UP IN PUBLIC HOUSING. MY MAMA IS FROM WAYCROSS, GEORGIA. THAT'S WAY ACROSS GEORGIA. SHE GREW UP IN THE 1950'S AND AS A BLACK TEENAGER, SHE SPENT MANY SUMMERS PICKING SOMEBODY ELSE'S COTTON. SHE SPENT MANY DAYS PICKING SOMEBODY ELSE'S TOBACCO. BUT THE OTHER DAY, THOSE 82-YEAR-OLD HANDS THAT USED TO PICK SOMEBODY ELSE'S COTTON PICKED HER YOUNGEST SON TO BE OUR NEXT UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA. THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT AMERICA. I LOVE AMERICA BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT COUNTRY THAT GIVES US THE POWER TO MAKE IT GREATER AND THE WAY WE MAKE IT GREATER IS FOR THE PEOPLE TO STAND UP. WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN. THIS IS OUR DEMOCRACY. IT DOESN'T BELONG TO THE POLITICIANS. IT BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE. AT OUR PLEASURE. SO I'M DEEPLY HONORED. THE STAKES OF THIS ELECTION CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. WE'VE GOT TO PASS COVID-19 RELIEF. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS ARE AT THE CENTER OF ANY RELIEF THAT WE PROVIDE. WE'VE GOT TO PROTECT ORDINARY PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS. FOR OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. FOR OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND OUR FIRE MEN AND FIRE WOMEN. WE'VE GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR THOSE WHO PUT IT ALL ON THE LINE FOR US, WHO RISK THEIR LIVES BY SAVING LIVES EVERY DAY. WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS VACCINE DISTRIBUTED SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND OTHER MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES DON'T FIND THEMSELVES AT THE BACK OF THE LINE. WE'VE GOT TO STAND UP FOR OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. ISN'T IT INTERESTING, THE FOLKS THAT WE HAVE TOO OFTEN IGNORED, REFUSED TO PAY A LIVABLE WAGE, THIS PANDEMIC HAS REMINDED US OF HOW IMPORTANT THEY REALLY ARE. THE FOLK WHO STOCK GROCERY STORE SHELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE MANY OF US ARE ASLEEP. THE FOLK WHO KEEP THE ECONOMY HUMMING. WE NOW CALL THEM ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WELL, IF THEY ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND INDEED THEY ARE, WE OUGHT TO PAY THEM AN ESSENTIAL WAGE AND PROVIDE TO THEM ESSENTIAL MEDICINE. IT'S ONLY RIGHT. AND WE HAVE TO STRENGTHEN THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT. AND MAKE SURE WE COVER EVERYBODY. I BELIEVE THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. AND IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON THE PLANET CAN AND OUGHT TO PROVIDE FOR ALL THE CITIZENS. WE CAN DO IT. WE JUST HAVE TO COMMIT TO DOING IT. I'VE BEEN MOVING ALL ACROSS THIS STATE, DROPPING BY LITTLE TOWNS, AND WHEN I GO INTO THESE SMALL, RURAL TOWNS, THEY'RE SURPRISED THAT I'M THERE. I'M SURPRISED THAT THEY'RE SURPRISED. THEY SAY REVEREND, WE'RE NOT USED TO SOMEONE RUNNING FOR THE SENATE COMING BY OUR LITTLE TOWN. THAT'S STRANGE TO ME BECAUSE I'M RUNNING TO BE A UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE WHOLE STATE OF GEORGIA. AND TOO MANY OF OUR RURAL AREAS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED. WE'VE HAD NINE HOSPITALS CLOSE IN THIS STATE IN 10 YEARS BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO EXPEND MEDICAID. , EXPAND MEDICAID. GEORGIA DESERVES A UNITED STATES SENATOR OR TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS WHO BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT, WHO WILL STRENGTHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT INSTEAD OF TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND WHO WILL MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS CAN NEVER BE DENIED COVERAGE FROM HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. GEORGIA DESERVES A UNITED STATES SENATOR WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT WHEN KIDS COME OUT OF SCHOOL, THEY SHOULD NOT BE SO BURDENED WITH COLLEGE DEBT THAT THEY HAVE A MORTGAGE BEFORE THEY HAVE A MORTGAGE. THEN, WE'VE GOT TO INVEST IN THIS COUNTRY THROUGH INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT THAT WILL CREATE BROADBAND IN THESE RURAL AREAS, REPAIR OUR ROADS AND OUR BRIDGES AND OUR BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE OUR BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURE IS A REFLECTION OF OUR BROKEN POLITICS AND WE MUST RISE UP IN THIS DEFINING MOMENT IN AMERICA AND REPAIR ROADS AND BRIDGE, REPAIR OUR DEMOCRACY FOR THE SAKE OF THE PEOPLE. AND WE CAN DO IT. THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS TO STAND TOGETHER. SO PUSH HARD NOW. IN THESE REMAINING COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND PUSH BACK AGAINST THE FORCES THAT TRY TO DIVIDE US. HAVE YOU NOTICED, I'M TRYING TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIVE DEBATE ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, AND MY OPPONENT IS TRYING TO REDUCE THIS RACE TO THE KIND OF EMPTY SCHOOLYARD INSULTS MADE BETWEEN CHILDREN WHO AREN'T THINKING VERY CAREFULLY ON A PLAYGROUND. THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS AND SHE'S BUSY CALLING ME NAMES. I'M TRYING TO HAVE A DEBATE AND SHE'S ENGAGED IN NAME CALLING. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, AS WE SAY IN THE SOUTH, BLESS HER HEART. SHE CAN CALL ME WHATEVER SHE WANTS. HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE. I BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. WE CAN PROVIDE IT IN THE RICHEST NATION ON THE PLANET. I BELIEVE THAT SENIORS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BUYING FOOD AND BUYING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD EVERY DAY DESERVE A LIVABLE WAGE. SHE CAN CALL THAT WHATEVER SHE WANTS. I CALL IT COMMON SENSE. AND SO HERE'S THE THING. I KNOW IT'S DARK BUT WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. WE THE PEOPLE CAN DO IT. THAT IS THE COVENANT WE HAVE WITH ONE ANOTHER AS AN AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE WE? WE ARE THOSE WHO WORK HARD EVERY DAY AND CAN BARELY GET BY. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO WORK HARD BECAUSE WE HAVE HEART, BUT WE DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO WORK TO MAKE OTHERS RICH BUT WE CAN BARELY MAKE THE RENT. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO ARE TRYING TO STRUGGLE AND MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE AND TECHNICAL SCHOOL AND VOCATIONAL SCHOOL SO WE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE GREAT AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO , WE WHO ARE DOING OK ECONOMICALLY. BUT DEEP IN OUR HEART, WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS AMISS. SOMETHING IS WRONG. AND THAT IT NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED. AND WE THE PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO CAN FIX IT IN THIS DEFINING MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. MY DAD USED TO WAKE ME UP EVERY MORNING AS I CLOSE AND NOBODY BELIEVES A BAPTIST PREACHER WHEN HE SAYS 'AS I CLOSE.' THEY SAY HE'S GOT AT LEAST TWO OR THREE MORE CLOSERS. BUT I'M HONESTLY, AS I CLOSE. MY DAD USED TO WAKE ME UP EVERY MORNING BECAUSE HE HAD A SERIOUS WORK ETHIC. HE WAS A VETERAN. LEARNED EARLY TO WAKE UP EARLY AND GET STARTED. HE WAS A PASTOR AND HE WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. HE HAD THINGS TO HANDLE. SO IT DIDN'T MATTER TO HIM WHETHER IT WAS A SCHOOL DAY OR SUMMERTIME. OR SATURDAY. HE WOKE ME UP SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, OFTEN AT DAWN. HE HAD A WAY OF SAYING, SON, GET UP, GET DRESSED, PUT YOUR SHOES ON, GET READY. HE DIDN'T THINK YOU SHOULD SLEEP LATE OR WALK AROUND, YOU KNOW, UNPREPARED. SO HE SAID GET UP, GET DRESSED, PUT YOUR SHOES, GET READY. I WAS A LITTLE BOY AND SO I ASKED HIM, DAD, IT'S SATURDAY.

AND THE THING ABOUT DAWN IS THAT IT IS MORNING BUT IT'S STILL DARK. IT'S DARK. BUT MORNING IS ON THE WAY. SO I WANT TO SAY TO YOU COLUMBUS, GEORGIA, I WANT TO SAY TO YOU, AMERICA, THAT I KNOW IT'S DARK BUT MORNING IS ON THE WAY. AND WEEPING MAY ENDURE FOR THE NIGHT BUT JOY COMES IN THE MORNING.

         "Well, thank you, David. Thank you for that kind introduction. Thank you all for the warm welcome. It is good to be with you. To Governor Ducey, to Jay Timmons, to business leaders, distinguished guests: It is my honor and privilege to be back with one of the most remarkable organizations in America that's been leading innovation, creating opportunity, and pursuing progress since 1895: the National Association of Manufacturers. Thank you for having me at this 2019 Board Meeting. (Applause.) And as I get started, I know you've had a busy couple of days, and I wanted, nevertheless, to begin by bringing greetings from a friend of mine , a businessman who now is in a different line of work but I know has made a great connection to all of you in this room and to business leaders around the country. I want to bring you greetings from a man whose leadership has helped bring American manufacturing back. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And I want to also ask you to join me in thanking a great leader in our administration. He's been a champion for manufacturers and hardworking entrepreneurs all across America. I know you've already heard from her at this 2019 Board Meeting, but join me in thanking Linda McMahon, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, for her great work for American jobs and opportunities. Thank you, Linda. (Applause.) We got a lot to talk about today. But before I begin, allow me to address the tragedy that was caused by more than 30 tornadoes that ripped through Alabama, Georgia, and Florida this past Sunday. I know the families of that region are on the hearts of everyone here, as they are on the hearts of every American. We mourn the 23 lives that were lost in Alabama, and our prayers are with the more than 30 people who are still missing, and the families of all of those affected by these terrible storms. At the direction of President Trump, FEMA has already deployed teams to Alabama and Georgia. And I can assure you they will continue to assist state and local search-and-rescue operations until we find and recover all who are missing. Our administration is in constant contact with state and local officials. The President and I have both spoken to Alabama Governor Kay Ivey. The governor has now requested a major disaster declaration, and the President will soon sign it into effect. But to all of those who have been impacted by these tornadoes, let say to each and every one of you, not just on behalf of our administration but on behalf of all of the American people: We are with you. We stand with you. And we will stay with you until you recover bigger and better than ever before. That's our solemn promise. So thank you for that. But today, I'm here simply to say thanks to the great leaders in this room. Thanks to the leaders in the National Association of Manufacturers. It's amazing to think, for more than 120 years, this association has served faithfully as a champion of America's manufacturers in the halls of Washington, D.C. and in state capitols around the country. You have promoted pro-growth, pro-jobs policies that have benefitted American workers and American jobs for generations. And thanks to NAM and your leadership, American manufacturing is back in 2019. (Applause.) It's true. The men and women in this room are not only a testament to the difference that you can make in the public square when you advance free-market principles but you also , you also really personify the American Dream. You represent the success of American manufacturing. And the stories in this room are too numerous to recount from one podium. But let me mention a few, of people like Charles Sukup, the President of Sukup Manufacturing in Sheffield, Iowa. His father, Eugene, founded the company more than a half a century ago with little more than an idea to dry corn a little bit faster. I had the privilege to meet Charles and his family just two years ago. And to you, Charles, and to your family, we want to express our condolences on your father's passing last summer. Today, Charles and his company help feed people around the world as the world's largest family-owned manufacturer of grain bins, dryers, and other farm equipment. In fact, Sukup Manufacturing hired over 200 new workers in 2018 alone. And I think that leadership and that legacy of job creation is worth a round of applause. Thank you, Charles, and thank you to Sukup. (Applause.) We also have with us John Williams, the Chairman and CEO of Jamison Door Company in Hagerstown, Maryland. Jamison Door Company was founded more than a century ago by three men with, I'm told, a little bit of money and a lot of determination. Since then, this family-owned business has produced more than a million doors for homes and businesses all across America. They've grown to more than 120 employees and recently broke ground on a new 50,000-square-foot manufacturing plant. Last year, thanks to the tax relief we'll talk more about in a moment, John Williams and Jamison Door actually was able to offer a raise to every single one of their employees even after they had given two separate bonuses worthy of a week's salary. That's what we call sharing the wealth and growing the American way. (Applause.) Thank you so much to Jamison and to the whole team. It's great. John stood with us in the Rose Garden at the White House last April when the President highlighted the incredible boost those tax cuts have given to manufacturers across the country. And the truth is, for the past two years, business leaders, like Charles and John, and all of you in this room, have been lending your support to advance the agenda the President and I were elected to bring to Washington, D.C. because you knew it would make a difference not just in our companies but in your communities, in your state, in your nation. From tax relief to new trade deals to deregulation, I wanted to come here to say 'thank you.' Thank you for standing with us as we have fought for American jobs and American workers. Because of you, we have unleashed prosperity for the American people and revitalized our nation's great manufacturers. We truly have. And just as we're grateful to each of you , (applause) , and just as we're grateful to each and every one of you for your support, let me assure you that America's manufacturers have no greater champion than President Donald Trump. (Applause.) This is a President whose family lived the American Dream. Came up in a small business of his own , a small family business. Watched his father build an enterprise. He had a bigger dream. He wanted to go across the river and build the big builds on Manhattan Island and eventually build a national and an international name and reputation in construction and hotels and hospitality. But this is a President that understands that a nation grows if a nation builds. He understands that manufacturing is vital to our nation. You, in the room here, build our roads and bridges. You make the cars and trucks that make America run. You forge the planes that travel our skies. You discover and develop life-saving medicines. You deliver affordable energy that powers our homes and businesses. You produce the food that feeds the nation and the world. And when it's all said and done, you make our families stronger, our lives more prosperous, and American manufacturing makes America succeed. (Applause.) You also create good-paying jobs that are really the foundation of the American Dream for millions of our fellow citizens. You know, I come from the state of Indiana where, back when I was governor, I used to say, 'In the Hoosier State, we do two things well: We make things and we grow things.' And I know the strength that manufacturing is in my home state and is in states all across this country. You, actually, at this very moment , manufacturers , employ more than 12 million Americans in all 50 states. And as President Trump wrote , President Trump said when he spoke, rather, to you in our first year in office: The drive and dedication of your workers 'makes this country run,' and their 'creations power our communities and protect our nation.' The truth is, American manufacturing and American manufacturing workers are the backbone of America. It's the truth. (Applause.) And all told, manufacturers contribute more than $2 trillion to our economy, and the overwhelming majority are small businesses. And this President understands the critical role that manufacturers play in the life of our nation. And since day one, as you've observed and partnered with us, we've been fighting to make it easier for you to make the products that make America and easier for the men and women who work on your shop floors to succeed. Since the 2016 election, I'm proud to report to you that, with your strong support for the policies that we've advanced, businesses large and small across this nation have created 5.3 million new jobs. And that includes good-paying manufacturing jobs all across America. (Applause.) You know, it's amazing to think, under the last administration, more than 2,000 manufacturing jobs were lost every single month on average; 210,000 jobs lost to manufacturing over the eight years of the past administration. In fact, the truth is, the last administration all but gave up on manufacturing in America. I'll never forget, at a town hall meeting in 2016 , right after my running mate had promised that we would bring back manufacturing jobs , then President Obama memorably asked, quote, 'What magic wand do you have?' Remember that? He couldn't believe it. He said, quote, 'What exactly are you going to do?' Adding, quote, 'There's no answer to it.' The words of the last President of the United States. But you in this room knew we did have an answer: less government, less taxes, less regulation, and President Donald Trump. And we thank you for your leadership and support. (Applause.) The truth is, in our first year in office, we more than made up for the loss of manufacturing jobs under the last administration. And today, thanks to your hard work and this President's leadership, there have been 480,000 new manufacturing jobs created since Election Day. No magic wand; just commonsense American ideals put into practice. And manufacturing is roaring back. (Applause.) In fact, I'm told 2018 was the best year for manufacturing job creation in more than 20 years. Last year also marked the highest level of optimism among manufacturers ever recorded. Just a few months ago, NAM announced that more than 92 percent of American manufacturers have a positive outlook on the future. And I can just tell looking at all of your faces that that statistic is holding even through today. But, you know, it's not just manufacturing. Under our administration, unemployment has hit a nearly 50-year low. We've seen the lowest unemployment rates on record for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans. And just last week, after the previous administration and countless experts said it couldn't be done, our administration announced that, for the first time in 13 years, we achieved over 3 percent economic growth for an entire calendar year. The American economy is roaring again. (Applause.) Now, this is a testament to all of you who are gathered here , to job creates in businesses large and small all across the country. And it's a testament to all the hardworking Americans that you employ. The truth is, the reforms that we've brought about have meant more money to invest in your business. A growing economy also means more money for your workers and for their families. And one of the most encouraging statistics to the President and me is that after years , years where we saw wages, you know, stubbornly stuck at a modest level of growth, today are rising at the fastest pace in more than 10 years, and they're growing fastest for blue-collar workers, the backbone of the American economy. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. And working Americans are prospering as they haven't done so for more than a decade. (Applause.) And, you know, I don't have to tell you in this room , this hasn't just happened. It's a direct result of the leadership and policies that President Trump and our administration have been advancing and that you've been fighting for , literally fighting for since day one of this administration and throughout the long tenure of this great association. But just look at what we've done in the area of regulation alone. The National Association of Manufacturers actually studied this issue, and I'm told that you found that federal red tape costs manufacturing businesses an astounding $19,500 per employee, per year. And for those of you running small manufacturing firms with fewer than 50 employees, the burden of federal regulation almost doubles to nearly $35,000 per employee, per year. It's amazing. That's why President Trump promised on the campaign trail, and every day since, to roll back the heavy hand of government. And we set a goal at the start of this administration to cut two regulations for every new federal regulation that we put on the books. But we didn't quite hit that mark, because the truth is we blew right past it. In the last year alone, I'm pleased to report to you that thanks to the President's leadership, our administration has cut 12 federal regulations for every new federal rule put on the books. We're cutting federal red tape as never before. (Applause.) In fact, this President has signed more bills cutting federal red tape than any President in American history. And since our election, we've actually delivered more than $33 billion in regulatory savings for working families and business owners. And under President Trump's leadership, we've also been busy unleashing American energy, the lifeblood of our economy, manufacturing, and the entire nation. We withdrew from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord. He approved, early on, the Keystone and Dakota Pipelines. He opened up Alaska National Wildlife Region, one of the largest oil and gas fields in the world. And thanks to these collective actions and the ingenuity of our energy producers, the United States is now the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas. (Applause.) And of course, with the strong support of NAM, before the end of our first year in office, President Trump signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. We cut taxes across the board for working families, family farms, and businesses large and small, and manufacturers just like those gathered here. We slashed the corporate tax rate from the highest in the developed world to below the average. We eliminated the death tax for nearly every American small business owner. And we gave businesses like yours the ability to deduct 100 percent of the cost of your new equipment for the next five years. For decades, jobs and investment poured overseas, but in the past two years, company after company have been making record investments right here in America. Because under this President and this administration, we will always promote and protect what the President calls those four beautiful words: Made in the USA. (Applause.) But with all we've accomplished in these first few years, as this President likes to say, that's just what we call a good start. If you haven't noticed, the American people actually elected a builder to be the 45th President of the United States. And I'm here to tell you that this President and our administration are absolutely committed to rebuilding the infrastructure of America. It is time for a major bill from the Congress to rebuild the roads and bridges and ports and highways of America. (Applause.) As the President said in that State of the Union Address, 'Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure.' And so they should. We're committed to working with the Congress to make historic investments in our infrastructure so that businesses can get your goods to market quicker and more efficiently than ever. You know, I've always said that roads mean jobs. And I don't just mean road jobs. I mean, the truth is, those of you in manufacturing understand that the right infrastructure makes it possible for you to deliver your goods not only across your state, across the nation, but across the world. And we're going to make sure , we're going to make sure that you have the infrastructure to support a growing economy. And to make sure that you can hire the workers you need to keep growing your business and investing in workers, this President is also making it easier than ever for the American people to get the training they need for the manufacturing jobs of the future. Recent studies show nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs are going to be created by businesses like yours in the next decade. But some 2.4 million of those jobs could go unfilled. Seventy percent of manufacturers are already seriously concerned about finding workers. And I hear it all the time, as I travel around the country, about the need for workers and the need for job training and workforce development. The skilled trades in particular, I'm told, are increasingly hard to come by. Electricians, welders, and machinists are in high demand, and too few Americans pursue these valuable paths. You know, the President Trump and I believe that all honest work is honorable. And that's why, in our first year, the President signed an executive order to expand apprenticeships and vocational education to help all Americans adapt to the constantly changing needs of the 21st-century America. We will make sure that we have the best-trained workforce in the world. And we'll work with each and every one of you to accomplish that. (Applause.) But it's not just here at home where we've been fighting for Americans manufacturers. This President has also been busy forging new trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. From Europe to the Indo-Pacific, we're negotiating deals that are built on the principles of free, fair, free, and reciprocal trade. And let me take this moment to thank all the leaders of this great organization for your strong support of our administration last year when the President negotiated and signed a replacement for the outdated NAFTA deal. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement has arrived. (Applause.) The USMCA, as it's known more briefly, is going to impact, we believe, more than 2 million American manufacturing jobs that depend on exports Canada and Mexico. And the USMCA will finally give workers the level playing field that we need to compete and win on a global stage. But now , now that the agreement has been signed and it's going to be considered in the Congress, let me take this opportunity to encourage your renewed energy and support. Governor Ducey and I were just speaking about this a few moments ago, about the importance of us hearing from business leaders and from state officials him, about the importance of swift congressional approval of the USMCA. The truth is, we'd done our jobs. We've negotiated a deal that puts American jobs and American workers first. And it's time for Congress to do theirs. So we urge you to send a strong message to members of Congress in all 50 states that it's time to approve the USMCA, and we must see it approved by Congress this year. (Applause.) While we've been forging new trade deals, we've also been standing up to unfair trade practices where we've encountered them around the world, and that most especially applies to the relationship and the challenges that we face in our economic trading relationship with China. For too long, China has pursued policies that are inconsistent with free and fair trade. And we all know it. As President Trump has said, for years the United States faced, in his word, 'tremendous tariffs' in trading relations with China. In fact, in 2017 alone, Beijing's trade abuses contributed to a $375 billion trade deficit between the United States and China. But as President Trump made clear, those days are over. You know, I'll never forget one of the early meetings, in the first year of our administration, with Chinese officials that came to the Oval Office in the White House. The business leaders in the room would have loved to have been there. You know, this President has a way of negotiating the way you all do over business deals every single day. There's a friendliness about it. There's a cordialness about it. And then there's a directness about it. And I'll never forget when we sat in the Oval Office with the Chinese , one of the Chinese officials that has come over. The President told him, you know, things have to change; that three-, four hundred billion-dollar trade deficits was no longer acceptable. Business as usual had to change. But he started it out by saying, 'Look ' , he looked at them and said, 'Look, you all have done your thing.' And he said, 'That's the past. This is now the future.' He said, 'I'm not looking backwards; I'm looking forwards.' But he did look at this Chinese official , I got to tell you , and he said , he look at him, and he referred to a trade barrier, Governor, that had been erected sometime in the early part of the last decade. And the President looked at him across the Oval Office and he said , he said, 'Well, you all put that trade barrier up.' And he said, 'Yeah, we did.' And he said , and he said, 'Do you mind if I ask you, how did you get away with that?' And the Chinese official looked at him rather shyly and said, 'Nobody ever called.' And the President just said, 'Well, there you have it.' Well, I'm here to tell you, men and women of the National Association of Manufacturing , those days are over. This President is picking up the phone. He is traveling the world. He is fighting for trade deals that are free, and fair, and reciprocal. And we're going to have trade that wins for America and wins for American manufacturers. (Applause.) Now, two weeks ago, I'm pleased to report, a delegation of Chinese officials came to Washington, D.C. to continue our ongoing negotiations. And as the President reported there, that we made substantial progress, most especially on structural issues , things like intellectual property and forced technology transfers. All the kinds of things that have beset American manufacturers seeking to do business in that part of the world. The President said, and we all recognize, that, for the first time, America has put ourselves in a position of strength, having imposed tariffs of some $250 billion. And I can assure you that negotiations are going to continue. The President has actually announced that he's making plans to meet with President Xi in the near future to resolve outstanding issues. And, in fact, we're so encouraged that, because these discussions have been so productive, the President decided to delay an increase in American tariffs that had been scheduled for just a few days ago. But I want to promise each and every one of in this room: President Trump and our administration will continue to stand strong until we establish trade between the United States and China that is free and fair and reciprocal. (Applause.) Finally, as we gather here in Arizona , and I know you're here from all over the country , the people here of Arizona appreciate more than most we have a crisis on our southern border. And this President has stepped forward to provide leadership to address that crisis. And the truth is, despite what you may hear from some of those that opposed the President's border security on Capitol Hill, this is a crisis the likes of which we've never seen before. I mean, for the first time ever, the majority of illegal immigrants coming into our country are unaccompanied minors and families, people who are being exploited by drug cartels and human traffickers to make the long and dangerous journey north through our southern border. And just today, the Department of Homeland Security announced that during this fiscal year to date, Customs and Border Protection has seen a more than 300 percent increase in the number of family units apprehended compared to the year ago. And we saw an incredible rise in the number of large groups who are attempting to cross the border. Two years ago , and the Governor knows these numbers well , two years ago, Border Patrol only encountered two groups of 100 or more individuals. But today, Secretary Nielsen announced that more than 70 large groups have been apprehended, a total of more than 12,000 people. Now, Democrats in Washington say this is a manufactured crisis. But the only thing manufactured is their outrage. Every day we don't secure our border, we allow the crisis to worsen, more lives to be endangered on both sides of the border, and more drugs to flow into our country, and more harm to come to American jobs and American workers. And that's why President Trump has taken such a strong stand for border security. We've already started to build the wall. We've secured some $23 billion for border security funding. And the President used his authority under the law to declare a national emergency on our southern border. Now, some in Congress are trying to stop the President from exercising the authority that Congress gave him to address this very real crisis. So, today, allow me to call on each and every one of you to join us in calling on members of the Senate to support the President's emergency declaration, stand up for border security, and put the safety and security and wellbeing of America first. (Applause.) Now, before I close, know this: In the days, and weeks, and months ahead, we're going to continue working to ensure that our nation's manufacturers grow and thrive, because we know that when you succeed, America succeeds. The stakes could not be higher, and the choice we face could not be clearer. As I said this weekend at another gathering, it is remarkable to think that as we gather here today, leading Democrats are openly advocating an economic system that has impoverished millions around the world. Under the guise of what's called Medicare for All or the Green New Deal, Democrats in Washington, D.C. and in the national debate are embracing the same tired economic theories that impoverished nations and has stifled the liberties of millions over the past century. That system is socialism. What they're actually offering is just more of the same: more taxes, more spending, more government, and less freedom. I've said before; I'll say it again: It was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the most prosperous economy in the history of the world. It was freedom, not socialism, that ended slavery, won two world wars, and stands today as a beacon of hope for all the world. It was freedom, not socialism, that is moving us beyond the prejudices of the past to create a more perfect union and extend the blessings of liberty to every American. It was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the highest quality of life, the cleanest environment on Earth, and improved the health and wellbeing of millions around the world. The truth is, what Medicare for All really means is quality healthcare for none. And the only thing green about the Green New Deal is how much green it's going to cost all of us if they ever actually pass it into law. The truth is, Margaret Thatcher has it right: 'The trouble with Socialism is eventually run out of other people's money.' The truth is, we want to make poor people richer, and they want to make rich people poorer. We want to make poverty more rare, and they want to make poverty more comfortable. I mean, that really is the choice that we face today. For all the progress that we have made over the last two years, as we look at the days ahead and I look at this gathering of extraordinary business leaders and job creators from all across the country, I hope you'll see that choice before us, as well. It is a debate between freedom and socialism; a debate between personal responsibility and government dependence. The President said it well in his State of the Union Address. In his words, 'America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination, and control.' And so, I say, the moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment America ceases to be America. So I say to all the leaders gathered here today, for the sake of our economy and our jobs, for the sake of all the hardworking people that are living the American Dream, working in great companies like yours, or aspiring to work with you and work in your enterprises freedom; for all of those that have a dream and want to live it out; and for the sake of our freedom: Let's say no to socialism. Let's say yes to freedom and prosperity and the pro-growth agenda that we know will make America strong. (Applause.) And I promise you , I promise you the President and I are going to keep fighting , keep fighting for all the things that you've supported over the last two years that have revived American manufacturing and are reviving this economy. But the truth is, it's going to take all of us in the days ahead. So I want to encourage each one of you to do your part. Keep promoting pro-growth policies, pro-jobs policies in Washington, D.C. and all around the country. And promote the policies that you know are going to not only make your company stronger but make our states and our nation stronger. By that I mean talk to your employees. Talk to your workers. Go meet with people in the cafeteria. Talk about the larger issues of the day. Talk about how we've been able to roll back taxes and regulation; how we've been able to fight for free and fair and reciprocal trade in ways that are contributing to their livelihood and the opportunities that they and their family have. Tell them how we've been rolling back the heavy hand of government so that your company can innovate, give them job security, and create more opportunities for more people in the community in the years ahead. I mean, tell them how we're putting Washington, D.C. back to work for them. And tell them that we're going to keep fighting for each and every one of them. Talk to your suppliers as well. Talk to your business associates. Send out an email. I mean, the truth of the matter is, those of us who serve in public office , whether it be the President, whether it be the Governor, whether it be Linda McMahon, or this Vice President , we can only do so much. You're the leaders in your communities and your state and all across this nation. And we want to encourage you today to let your voice be heard. On all these major issues, just know that sending an editorial to your local paper, sitting down for a local interview, talking to your employees, or speaking at a local Rotary Club makes the difference all across this country. And we encourage you to let your voice be heard. And I truly do believe that with your continued support, with President Donald Trump in the White House, with support all across this country for policies that are making American manufacturing and American economy strong, and with God's help, we will make this country more prosperous than we could ever possibly imagine. We will make this country safer than it's ever been before. And to borrow a phrase, we will make America great again. Thank you all very much. God bless you. (Applause.) And God bless the United States of America. It's an honor to be with you.",

         "Thank you, Madam Secretary, and thank you for your great leadership. You all may be seated. To the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Schultz, Vice Admiral Buschman, Director Padilla, Director Ayala, and to all of you serving in the uniform of the United States of America at every level, all of you who serve and protect the people of this nation: It is my honor to be here with all of you at Coast Guard Base Portsmouth. Thank you for your service. (Applause.) It is amazing to think, as we reflected earlier today on the work of the joint task force , it's amazing to think of all the different agencies and all the different courageous service that's represented here, and the difference that each and every one of you make. The Department of Homeland Security: Some 240,000 men and women who work each and every day to protect the homeland, to protect American families, to protect our cities, and to protect the nation against the scourge of drug addiction, the impact of criminal syndicates. So as I begin my remarks today, let me bring a word of gratitude, admiration, and appreciation from your Commander-in-Chief. I bring the thanks of the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The President asked me to be here today to hear the latest on the efforts of the joint task force, but also just to express a word of appreciation to each and every one of you and, to no less extent, your families for the service that you render to the people of this country each and every day. I hope some of you had a chance to see the State of the Union Address last night. The President of the United States addressed the nation. He laid out a bold, bipartisan vision and called on the Congress to join the American people, to join each and every one of you, to choose greatness. But it is something I know each and every one of you do every day. The President called for unity in Washington. He asked members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, to come together to 'build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock,' in his words, 'the extraordinary promise of America's future.' And as the President said in his State of the Union , and I say with equal conviction, looking out at all of your shining faces and thinking of all that you represent here, across this department, across this country , indeed, the state of our union is strong and it is safer because of the work that all of you do every day. And the American people know it. Give yourselves another round of applause. (Applause.) And we know that your service comes with sacrifice for you and your families. And, frankly, your character shines through each and every day through deployments, through missions that you undertake. And the nation, frankly, saw your character in high relief in recent weeks when the President took a strong stand for border security during the government shutdown that lasted some 35 days. Let me say to each and every one of you: The President and I couldn't more grateful or couldn't be more proud of all our federal employees and their families who rose to the challenge, stayed on task. But we are especially grateful to the men and women of the Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security. You stood tall, you stood your watch, you did not relent. And you have our thanks for your commitment to your mission and your duty. Thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you for standing your post. And just know this President and I, and our entire administration, have your back. And even as we speak today, the Congress is working on funding not only for the Coast Guard, for the Department of Homeland Security, but for other critical agencies of the government. And we're working in good faith to resolve these issues. But I promise each and every one of you, just as you stand and fight every day for the safety and security of the American people, President Donald Trump and I are going to stand and fight to get you what you need to accomplish your mission and keep the American people safe. That's our promise. (Applause.) We recognize, and I just heard in my briefing, your job is more challenging because our border is not secure along the southern border of the United States. A porous border along the United States gives drug traffickers and criminal cartels too many opportunities. And the traffic that the Coast Guard, the traffic that the joint task force interdicts all across the east coast through the Gulf of Mexico, and along the southern border of this country, is reflective of that reality. Enforcing our laws and protecting the American people is what all of you do best. And I just want to assure you, as evidenced in the President's words last night, as evidenced in the determination that he and our administration has reflected, we're going to continue to fight to get you what you need to accomplish that mission. And we are going to secure our border one way or another. (Applause.) Now, it is impressive to learn, Admiral, about this joint task force and to think about the interagency efforts. It really is remarkable to think about it. Joint Task Force-East, and West, and Investigations, do an extraordinary job leading a coalition of partners from across DHS, Coast Guard, Customs, Border Protection, Immigrations Customs Enforcement, U.S. Citizenship, Immigration Services, ICE. And of course, let's not forget, our great partners in local law enforcement who work with all of our federal agencies every single day. We respect and appreciate them as well. (Applause.) You also work hand-in-hand with the Department of Defense and our international partners to advance the security and prosperity here at home and, frankly, all across the Western Hemisphere. I just heard a briefing on our investigations division, and learned about how we have, literally, forward deployed to deal with those who would threaten our families and threaten our communities long before they're ever anywhere close to the border of the United States of America. And those international partnerships are vital to our efforts. The work you do every day saves lives, and it's remarkable to think about that. And I hope each and every one of you understands that the American people know it, from your Commander-in-Chief on down: The work that each and every one of you does every day stems the tide of narcotics that comes into this country that literally claims the lives of tens of thousands of Americans. We cannot account for the lives that are saved, but we know they are many. We think of the great news yesterday. I was just informed that the Coast Guard Cutter Forward, a sister ship of the Bear that I was just on, homeported here in Portsmouth. It literally offloaded more than 15 tons of cocaine that had been seized over the past two months during counter-narcotics operations in the Eastern Pacific. Join me in thanking the whole crew of the Forward for a job well done that is saving American lives. (Applause.) The truth of the matter is, none of you in this room have to wonder whether you make a difference, because you do, every single day. And I want tell you, as I travel all across this country, I hear about the admiration of all of the agencies represented here. I hear the expressions of support, and I expect very recently you heard it as well, from communities and families that reached out to yours and just took the opportunity to let you know how grateful they are to each and every one of you. And I can assure you that is the , that is a reflection of the view of all of the American people. You know, I was on Capitol Hill on September 11, 2001. We didn't even have a Department of Homeland Security then. I'll never forget seeing the smoke rise from the Pentagon. And I'll never forget when we traveled to Ground Zero a week later, and saw the unspeakable devastation of the evil that had descended there. You, in a very real sense , all the agencies here, now under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security and the capable leadership of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen , you're all a part of an American response that keeps our nation safe, that leans into the fight against those who would harm our families, who would seek to profit through narcotics, who would enslave people through human trafficking and the brutality that's represented there, and also who would seek to come into our country with criminal intent or terrorist intent. You make a difference every day. And I want you to know that we all know it, and we're grateful to each and every one of you. And I want to promise you, for all that you do every single day, President Donald Trump and our administration will always have your back. Our record, I hope, speaks for itself. Within a month in office, the President signed an executive order to strengthen the authority of DHS, the Coast Guard, and law enforcement at every level to combat transnational criminal organizations, and cartels, and gangs that threaten the American people and are constantly changing in their methods. Last August, the President signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act, updated the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act to make it easier for all of you and all those serving on the frontlines of law enforcement to bring maritime smugglers to justice. And we're grateful for the support in Congress that made that possible. And, of course, since the first day of this administration, President Donald Trump has worked to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. In our first year in office, the President signed into law the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the largest military pay raise in nearly 10 years. (Applause.) And as the Commandant knows, there was more than $12 billion for the Coast Guard to rebuild your aging fleets and strengthen the vital assets of your mission. So congratulations to you all. (Applause.) So we've made incredible progress in the last two years, but the truth is, as I said before, we recognize that your jobs and all the agencies represented so well here , your jobs are as difficult and dangerous as ever, largely driven by the security and humanitarian crisis along the southern border of the United States. And we do have a crisis on our southern border. It's extraordinary to think that, every single day, some 2,000 people attempt to come into this country illegally. And those are just the people that are apprehended by agencies and Border Patrol so well represented here. Two thousand people a day coming into the United States of America. It's a security crisis. Last year alone, some 10,000 individuals with prior criminal convictions were apprehended attempting to come into the United States of America. But's it's also a humanitarian crisis. I don't need to tell all of you with responsibilities along our southern border, gathered here in this room, that for the first time ever, the majority of people seeking to come into our country illegally are families and unaccompanied minors , putting an enormous burden on our system. And it's a reflection of human traffickers and cartels that I learned today charge upwards of $5,000 per person to entice vulnerable families to take the long and dangerous journey up the peninsula , a journey that, for most, results in physical and sexual abuse along the way. And for some, even worse. We have cartels and human trafficking organizations , criminal syndicates , that take advantage of vulnerable families and take advantage of loopholes in our laws and our porous borders. And as the President of the United States said last night, 'This is a moral issue.' We have a moral duty to secure our border and reform the immigration laws of the United States of America. And we will do it. (Applause.) And the cost , the cost, you all know, is extraordinary. Every day our southern border remains unsecured gives criminal syndicates and drug traffickers and human traffickers another opportunity to threaten our families and harm people on both sides of the border. The men and women of the Coast Guard and DHS know firsthand about these transnational criminal organizations in Mexico and Central America , the drug cartels that fuel their deadly trade. They represent one of the greatest national-security and public-health threats in the history of this country. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of death for adults under 55 years of age. In 2016, across America, 174 people lost their lives to drug overdose every single day. The illicit drug trade not only claims the lives of tens of thousands of Americans, it also strengthens; it strengthens the ability of those criminal syndicates in the world that engage in their heinous activities, from extortion to human trafficking, and worse. The challenges and threats that you personally face in the line of duty underscore the reason why we are so determined to give you the resources that you need to secure our border and protect this homeland. And we will do it. President Trump, as he described last night, has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border. It's really an all-of-the-above plan. It's a plan that includes humanitarian assistance; more law enforcement personnel; drug detection technology at our ports of entry; closing loopholes that enable child smuggling; and a proposal for a new physical barrier. As the President said last night: A smart steel barrier on our southern border. Walls work, and we need to secure our border, including with a physical barrier. And we will do it one way or another. We're going to secure our border. That's our promise to each and every one of you. And we're going to support each one of you in the efforts that you make on behalf of the American people. In the days ahead, you can be confident that just as each and every one of you step forward to protect this nation every day, to stand up for the American people, we're going to continue to stand with you to give you the resources and the support that you need. So thank you all for coming out today. It's a great honorto meet you. I hope to get a chance to say hello to as many of you as possible in person. It's the greatest honor of my life to serve as your Vice President, and I thank you for coming and spending a few minutes with me today in the midst of all of your duties. So I came here to say: We're with you. We're going to stand with you. We're going to continue to fight to give you the resources that you need to protect the homeland and secure our border. But as I said before, I also came here just to say thanks. The Good Book says, if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. Let me assure each and every one of you, the American people honor your service. We respect the way you've answered the call for this country. I was sitting down in the Mess Hall of the Bear just a few minutes ago. And one of those Coast Guardsmen , I looked across at him and I asked him, 'Why did you join the Coast Guard?' He'd been in about 12 years. Talked about how he remembered 9/11. He just wanted to do something for his country and to protect his country. And I think what's remarkable about that answer is it's very typical of, I know, how all of you feel. Public service is a calling. Public safety is a calling. It's a calling to a mission to consider others as more important than yourself; to count your life as less important than the lives of your countrymen. And so, I really came here to say thank you. I came here to say thank you. Thank you to each and every one of you for your service. Thank you for what you do to keep the American people safe each and every day. And just know that while you have our thanks, you have our support, I'm also confident that you do have the prayers of millions of Americans. So I'll close with that prayer as well, that 'no harm will overtake you no disaster will come near and He guard you in all your ways,' as you guard the people of the United States of America. So thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. (Applause.)",

         "Uh, Alicia Keys. Honestly, I just want to say something. Alicia Keys. I've known her for a long time, and the thing is that she is she has a gift. We all know that she has a gift. She has an incredible voice. She is a just such an incredible talent as a musician, as a writer. And she always, on top of all of that, shows up and shows up for our country, shows up on issues and does it with incredible courage, but always truth speaking. And we have to applaud an artist with the gift that she has, who does it all and does it all always with grace and with conviction. Can we again give it up for Alicia Keys? Can you hook for Alicia Keys? Well, it is so good to be in Phoenix. What's up, Phoenix? It's so good to be here. It's so good to be back. I was just here. Actually, Joe and I came to Phoenix the day after that debate I had with Mike Pence. So it's good to be back in Phoenix. And I wanna thank Ruben Gallego, the most incredible congressman. He is a friend. He is a leader for Arizona. He is a national leader. Please give it up for Ruben Gallego and Congressman Greg Stanton again, a great leader who was a leader always fighting for the people of the state he rolled to Borini. She is going to get this done. Candidate for Arizona. Six. Phoenix mayor can't Diego. Thank you. What a powerhouse! So it's This is a good time. This is a good time. Six days to go. And like Alicia said, we are here joyful, knowing what is at stake and we understand than in fighting for all of the issues that will be determined based on the outcome of this election, we can work hard while still enjoying some good music, dancing a good dance bop in our head, knowing that with joy and optimism, we fight for the things we believe in. This is not a fight against anything. This is a joyful fight for what we know can be unburdened by what has been. That's what's before us. That is what is before us, Phoenix And I'll tell you in the in the spirit of the late, great John McCain, I'm here to also engage in a little straight talk because I'll tell you, you know, for example, you know there's been there's been a lot of talk from the current occupant of the White House about my values. Well, let me just tell you, in the spirit of John McCain, I am a proud, patriotic American. It was very clear thinking about the values we as Americans share when it comes to knowing that the commander in chief of the United States of America should have as his first priority the health and well being of the American people. I am clear in understanding. This is the greatest failure of any presidential administration we have ever witnessed as a country. And I know that we are all prepared to stand for the democracy of our country and to stand for this country we love, and the challenges are there great. We are facing right now probably four crises that have converged at one time because of this pandemic, we're looking at a public health crisis. That is what I've been calling one of the greatest mass casualty events we have experienced designation since World War two. We're looking at over 225,000 people who have died in just the last several months, many of whom, because of the nature of this pandemic, were with out their family members for their last minutes and hours on this earth. We're looking at a public health crisis where a virus has infected over 8.5 million Americans who are going to face unknown long term health consequences, including what? Including what doctors are telling us lung scarring and things of that nature. And I bring this up and these numbers up because I think it is really important for us to understand it didn't have to be this bad. It did not have to be this bad, thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward. We know that the president of the United States and the vice president of the United States were informed about the nature of this pandemic. Back on January 28th. They were informed that it was five times as lethal as deadly as the flu. They were informed it could hurt people of every age. They were in formed that it was airborne. But what did they do with this information? They sat on it. They covered it up. They did not tell the American people. Instead, the president of the United States said it was a hoax. And then most recently, just in the last couple of days at the gall to say We're rounding the corner on it. But Phoenix, can you imagine what you would have done if you had known on January 28th? How serious this was, What you as a parent, what you is a working person? What you is a small business owner or someone who works for a small business. You was a teacher what you might have done if you had known on January 28th, you know, because even before this pandemic, you know, Donald Trump was walking around talking about how the economy is great. The economy is great, right? But the fact is that in America, even before the pandemic, far too many families had to work two and three jobs to put food on the table and pay the rent. And let me just tell you something in Joe Biden and my American, nobody should have to work more than one job to pay the rent and put food on the table. Even before this, we were looking at the fact that the average American family had less than $1000 in savings. But how people would have prepared shoot how people would have bought a little bit more toilet paper. Have we known what this was all gonna be and Lysol. But I make light of it because the reality is they knew and they did not tell the people because they put politics in front off the priorities of the American people. And so we are now in this public health pandemic, but it is even worse than them covering it up. You do know that the president of the United States with his boy Bill bar, are in the United States Supreme Court right now, suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act in the midst of a pandemic. The Affordable Care Act, which was brought tow us by President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden and brought health care to over 20 million people who did not have it protected people with preexisting conditions so that they could not be denied coverage based on a preexisting condition. Honk. If you know somebody who has diabetes, honk if you love somebody who has high blood pressure honk. If you know some body with breast cancer honk, if you know somebody with Lupus with all right and they're trying to get rid of it, you know, in part of it, I just have to say, You know, even when he was running for office, it was clear that the man just had this very weird obsession with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. And this is just a extension of that. But here's the thing. Phoenix We don't really want presidents who have weird obsessions, do we? No, Joe Biden is saying. Instead of trying to get rid of the Affordable Care act, Joe and I are saying no, let's expand coverage. Let's expand coverage understanding. We need to bring down Medicare eligibility to age 60. Let's expand coverage in terms of bringing down the cost of prescription drugs bringing down the cost of premiums. Let's expand coverage understanding. When we're talking about health care, the body just just start from the neck down. It is also the neck up , and we need to have mental health care available for everyone who needs it. There is a clear contrast, a clear choice in this election about where we go from here, a public health crisis and economic crisis. We are looking at an economic crisis that is being compared to the Great Depression. Over 30 million Americans in just the last several months filed for unemployment insurance. Here in Arizona, one out of 10 families is describing their household is having been hungry. We're not talking enough about that. I've seen numbers that one in five mothers is describing her Children. Under the age of 12. We are in the midst of, ah, hunger crisis in America. Here in Arizona, one in nine families could not pay their rent. Are are worried about being able to pay their rent next month. Here in Arizona, one in four small businesses have gone out of business, and there is a clear contrast because on the one hand you have Joe Biden who, when asked, How do you think the economy is doing? Joe Biden will say, Well, tell me how working people are doing. Tell me how working families are doing Joe Biden, who says You want to talk to me about the economy? Then let's talk about what we need to do because we are not going to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year, we are going to increase middle class tax cuts. We are going to ensure that families working families do not pay more than 7% of their income in child care. We know that the path Thio intergenerational wealth with so many families includes homeownership. So first time home buyers will get a $15,000 tax credit for a down payment and closing costs. That's how Joe thinks about the economy. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who, when asked, How's the economy doing? You know what he says almost every time. Well, how's the stock market doing? How are rich people doing? Which is why one of his first orders of business was to pass a tax cut benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America, to the point that we will be faced with a $2 trillion deficit. Well, let me tell you, if we do what we need to do in these next six days, Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut on invest that money in working families. Invest that money in building up our infrastructure, building back up our roads and bridges, building back up what we need to do around renewable energies. And that's gonna be about millions of jobs because we know when you invest in the American worker in American families, we as an economy will always do well, no, there's a clear choice in this election. The crises that we are confronting include a long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. And you have Joe Biden, who is informed about America's history and has the courage to speak truth and say the phrase black lives matter that Joe Biden who understands it, may be difficult to hear. But we've got to confront racial disparities in America in our health care system, in our economy, in our education systems, Joe says. We need to deal with small businesses so many minority and women owned small businesses who have gone out of business. And so we will invest $150 billion in low interest loans and access to capital for those businesses. Joe knows we need to deal with the criminal justice system. It must be reformed and do that and do it in a way that is about getting rid of private prisons. Getting rid of cash bail, which is an economic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue decriminalizing marijuana expunging expunging the records of people who have been convicted for marijuana offenses. Joe Biden knows we have to deal with policing, and we have to hold anybody accountable who breaks the law. And so we will put in place a ban on chokeholds and carotid holds. George Floyd would be alive today if that were the case. We will say there needs to be a national registry for police officers who break the law because you can't just do it in one place and then get fired and move to another place and get hired. That's not right. Joe Biden has the courage to speak these truths in a way that is about bringing folks together and fixing the problems we know exist. On the other hand, you have the current president of the United States who went on a debate stage debate before last, refused to condemn white supremacists and then double down, saying, Stand back and stand by and be clear. This is a pattern. This is the fellow who ran for office partly on a campaign theory to suggest that the first black president of the United States was an illegitimate president of the United States. This is the same person. There's a pattern here. Phoenix who on the on the tragedy of what happened in Charlottesville remember that people were peacefully protesting racial injustice. There was a young woman who was killed in that protest. And on the other side there were neo Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying tiki torches, hurling racial and anti Semitic slurs and the commander in chief. So there were fine people on both sides, a person who came into office calling Mexicans rapists and criminals. A person who came in the office in one of his first orders of business was institute a Muslim ban. We deserve so much more. Let me tell you, Joe, in his heart in his soul, is running, knowing that we must bring our country together and give dignity to all people. Joe knows it is time to End this this attempt to spew hate and division among us. It is time to end trying to get Americans to turn on each other. Joe knows the real sign of someone's strength is not based on who you beat down. It's based on who you lift up. They're really, really choices in this election. Let's deal with something that all of us on the West Coast and in this area of the world understand quite well. And it is that we are in the midst of a crisis in terms of our climate, and it poses a threat. To us as a species and we must acknowledge the science and deal with it. You've got Joe who says I see what's happening. I see that you have the West Coast, my home state of California, Oregon. Washington called all the fires, the wildfires, devastating entire communities or having to be evacuated. I have met with families that have been evacuated. I have met with firefighters who are fighting fires while their own homes are burning. My brother in law is a firefighter, the devastation is profound. You go to the Gulf Coast states. In fact, right now what is it? Zeta is hitting Louisiana. It's the fifth named storm this year, I say, named be cause they don't name a small storm. It's serious what it's doing in terms of hurting the livelihood and well being of families in the Midwest floods, to the point that farmers in that area of our country have lost a whole season of crops. We have to take this seriously, Joe says. We have to deal with the science, but we have to see the opportunity, and the crisis is, well, one. The clock is ticking on this, and we need to act with a sense of urgency and put in place goals like Net zero emissions by 2050. We need to understand that we have to have ah, protection of land and open spaces. We need to understand that an investment in renewable energies is also about an investment in jobs and investment in the apprenticeship programs of our building trades and the carpenters and plumbers and the electrician's don't understands what leadership looks like on this. On the other hand, you have the current president of the United States who went approached by journalists and that the journalist said something like, You know, these wildfires that happened in California And the scientists are saying, You know, that the science tells us that these extreme weather conditions are a very big factor and what's going on? And do you know that the president of the United States of America responded? The commander in chief of the United States of America, He's supposed to be a worldwide leader, responded when asking that when being asked that question. Science doesn't know as though science is a person. Well, Mr President, science does know. it is time we take this issue seriously. So, yeah, so the stakes are high, The stakes are high. Phoenix and you in this state. The reason I'm here, the reason I was here with Joe last time I was in Tucson earlier today. The reason I'm here is to thank you, because I do believe you all are going to make a real statement about who we truly are as a country. Arizona has a well earned reputation for wanting truth talkers. Straight talkers. Arizona has a long standing reputation for no Bs just get the job done. Arizona understands that. Come to me, talk ing about issues that are the issues I deal with. They keep me up in the middle of the night that have me sitting at my kitchen table trying to figure it all out. That's what Arizona demands off its leaders. And in this election, that is what is at stake. Joe and I are very proud of the fact that in this campaign we have built one of the broadest coalitions you've ever seen. We' ve got, of course, Democrats. But we've got Republicans. Cindy McCain, Jeff Flake, Independence Peope of all back grounds coming together, understanding what is at stake. And the issues are yes, the four things we've already talked about it so much more. It's about putting. It's about putting Resources into our public education system. We will triple teachers Title one funding. It's about fighting for civil rights, including LGBTQ Rights. It is about immediately putting a pathway to citizenship and renewing protections for our dreamers under DACA. There is so much at stake. And I do believe because of who you are, you will make a difference not only in terms of who wins, but you will make a difference in terms of saying who we are. And so here's the thing you know people, then ask well, I don't know if I should vote or doesn't matter. Why should I vote? People ask these questions often, right? I'm sure all of us have been asked the question. I think there are three reasons people should vote. One is to honor the ancestors honor the ancestors. You know, this year we lost a great American hero. Congressman John Lewis. John Lewis shed his blood fighting good trouble. Shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the right for folks to vote right for the right for black Americans to vote. When black Americans were being denied the right to vote, John Lewis understood that was a civil rights issue. That was an issue about a statement of who we are as a country. Which is why, and John Lewis's life. He also was one of the first in line to fight for marriage equality. Why John Lewis was one of the first in line to fight for immigrant rights because he understood this is about civil rights, and he paid a price for that by shedding his blood. So let's honor the ancestors. Let's honor the ancestors. When we just this year celebrated the 1/100 anniversary of the 19th Amendment, let's honor those suffragettes who in their white marched and shouted and fought and dared any one to tell them they were less than equal. And let's also speaking truth. Remember history that black women, how ever, were not allowed to vote until 1965. But let's honor the ancestors understanding it is our responsibility. To take on what they fought for us to have as a right and to follow through with that Number two. Let' s vote. Because of everything we have discussed, that is at stake. There was so much that impacts us every day that is at stake in this election. And here's my third point about voting. You know , I'm traveling the country. I've been in Georgia, Been in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio. Um, I've been everywhere. I' m gonna be going to Texas. Um, so you know, in 2013 the United States Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act. Right? Okay. It's called Shelby V. Holder. They took out the ability of the Justice Department to enforce the need for fair voting laws, and immediately thereafter in 2013 almost two dozen states put in place laws that were designed to make it difficult for folks to vote. They purged the rolls in and and they focused on black voters, voters of color students, our indigenous brothers and sisters, right? And so much so that in North Carolina, a court of appeal reviewed the case and said that they passed a law with quote surgical precision to prevent black people from voting. That's how bad it's been. Not to mention the president, United States, that that first debate got up on a stage in front of 70 million Americans and in my opinion, openly encouraged a suppression of the vote and all of the states that are trying to make it confusing. I mean, states where you gotta fill out the ballot and put it in one envelope, and then you're supposed to put on another envelope. In some states where you gotta have been a third person, sign the envelope, you know, States that air picking up the drop boxes so that people can't find it easy to drop off their ballots states that air closing down polling places, the messing with the post off the post office, the post office postal workers are like the best, nicest people you could ever meet. They're messing with the post office. And so you gotta ask, Why are so many powerful people trying to make it so confusing and difficult for us to vote? And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. And so let us not let anyone ever take our power from us. Let us use the power of our voice at election time through our vote because the power is with the people. And you know, when people say, Well, what do you think about what's gonna happen the day after the election? Here's what I say. America's democracy is always going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. So my last point is this. This moment will pass, and years from now, our Children, our grandchildren and others they're gonna look in our eyes. Each one of us and they will ask us. Where were you that moment And what we are all going to be able to tell them? It's so much more than just how we felt. We will tell them what we did way will tell them what we did. We will tell them we organized folks. We help people get to the polls. We reminded people to vote early. We texted and we called. And we emailed to the point that people got sick of us. But we knew they get over it. We did everything that was necessary to remind each other that we are not alone, that we are in this together, that we each have the power and that we love our country and are prepared to fight for its ideals. And we will tell them we elected Joe Biden, president of the United States. Thank you, Phoenix.",

         "WHAT'S UP, DETROIT! IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK. CAN WE HEAR IT FOR CORY BOOKER. WE ARE CELEBRATING THE WORK WE ARE ABOUT TO DO FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS. WE'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO, EVERYBODY. MICHIGAN, I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION. I DO BELIEVE THAT. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THIS GREAT STATE, IT IS THE MEASURE OF HOW AMERICA IS DOING AND WHAT AMERICA IS CAPABLE OF DOING. AND WHEN YOU PUT THE KIND OF FIGHT AND WORK THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS PUT INTO INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF AMERICA, WE WILL ELECT JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE JOE IS RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS THAT THIS IS A FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME WE HAVE TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK OURSELVES WHO ARE WE AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS ARE POWERFUL FORCES THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SELL HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US. THEY ARE VOICES THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DIVIDE US AND HELP US TURN AGAINST EACH OTHER AND HERE'S MY THEORY ABOUT IT. I BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN A CONSCIOUS ATTEMPT TO TRY TO DISILLUSION US, TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THE SYSTEM CANNOT AND WILL NOT EVER WORK FOR US, TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THAT WE CANNOT TRUST OUR DEMOCRACY TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THAT WE DON'T MATTER, POWERFUL FORCES THAT CONSCIOUSLY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SAY TO YOU YOU DON'T MATTER, SO DON'T PARTICIPATE, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK A DIFFERENCE. THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY TO US DO NOT TRUST YOUR GOVERNMENT. THEY TRY TO CONVINCE US THAT THEY ARE A LOAN. LET'S SEE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT POWERTHEPOWER IS WITH THE PEOPLE. WHAT WE KNOW IS WE WILL NOT BE OVERLOOKED, AND WE WILL NOT BE CANCELED. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT SAYING WE KNOW WHAT MATTERS AND WE KNOW THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE NOT ACHIEVED THE IDEALS OF THE COUNTRY AND YES, WE ALL KNOW THAT. BUT WE KNOW IF WE STOP FIGHTING WE WILL NEVER GET THERE AND SO WE FIGHT. THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION HAS BEEN ABOUT FIGHTING FOR OUR IDEAS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE JOE WE KNOW. I'M PROUD TO ENDORSE JOE BIDEN TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I BELIEVE IN JOE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO REFLECTIVE OF HIS PERSONALITY IS WHEN HE SAYS THERE IS ROOM FOR EVERYONE, BUT THAT IS WHO HE IS. THAT'S REALLY WHAT HE IS. HE'S AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS LIVED A LIFE OF INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO OTHERS. SHE HAD MADE GREAT PERSONAL SACRIFICES IN HIS LIFE. HE IS EXPERIENCED IN LIFE GREAT PAIN AND GLORY. HE UNDERSTANDS WHO PEOPLE ARE. I'VE BEEN IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. DONALD TRUMP, HE DOESN'T GET IT. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT GET IT. HE DOESN'T SEE PEOPLE. THE ONLY PEOPLE HE SEES ARE THE PEOPLE HE LOOKS IN THE MIRROR AND SEES. HE DOESN'T SEE THE PEOPLE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO FEELS, WHO UNDERSTANDS, WHO IS THINKING ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET TO THE END OF THE MONTH WHEN HE'S WORKING TWO JOBS AND HE KNOWS HE'S MISSING HIS SON'S BALLGAME. WE KNOW SOMEBODY IN THE PARKING LOT LOOKING AT THE SLIDING GLASS DOORS OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND KNOWING EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS INSURANCE, IF SHE WALKS THROUGH WITH HER SICK CHILD IS SLIGHTLY OUT OF POCKET MULTIPLE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR HER DEDUCTIBLE. NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS THE COURAGE AND THE POWER TO SEE AND FEEL AND UNDERSTAND THAT AS A SIGN OF STRENGTH AND BEEN LEFT UP TO PEOPLE. THAT IS JOE BIDEN. ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, I GOT TO KNOW JOE BEST THROUGH HIS SON. HOW THE BIG BANG HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN PREDATORY LENDING ACTIVITIES, SO MANY PEOPLE HERE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY LOST THEIR HOMES TO FORECLOSURE CRISIS AND JOE BIDEN STOOD WITH ME EVEN THOUGH THE STATE OF STATE OF DELAWARE HAVEN'T BEEN HIT AS HARD AS SOME OF THE OTHER STATES. I GOT TO KNOW JOE THROUGHBO. IT'S RARE TO SEE SUCH A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A FATHER AND HIS SON. IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP THEY HAD. AND HE SHOWED COURAGE ALL THE TIME AND CONVICTION. HE SPOKE WITH SO MUCH LOVE ABOUT THE FATHER RAISED HIM INTO THE MAN HE WAS. I KNOW JOE AND THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING HIM AND MY FINAL POINT IS MICHIGAN, JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. ECONOMIC JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. HEALTHCARE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. RACIAL JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. AND JOE BIDEN IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020.

         "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by President-elect Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware Good afternoon. Today I am pleased to announce the team that will lead my Administration's ambitious plan to address an existential threat of our time , climate change. Like their fellow-Cabinet nominees and appointments, members of our environment and energy team are brilliant, qualified and tested, and barrier-busting. With today's announcements there will be six African American members of our Cabinet. A record. After today, our Cabinet won't just have one or two precedent-breaking appointments, but 12 , including today's long-overdue appointment of the first Native American Cabinet Secretary. Already there are more people of color in this Cabinet than any Cabinet ever. More women than ever. The Biden-Harris Cabinet will be an historic Cabinet. A Cabinet that looks like America. That taps into the best of America. That opens doors and includes the full range of talents we have in this nation. And like the rest of the team, today's nominees are ready on Day One, which is essential because we literally have no time to lose. Just this year, wildfires burned more than 5 million acres in California, Washington, and across the West , an area roughly the size of the entire state of New Jersey. Intense and powerful hurricanes and tropical storms pummeled Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, and across the Gulf and along the East Coast. Record floods, hurricane-speed windstorms, and severe droughts ravaged the Midwest. And more Americans see and feel the devastation in big cities and small towns, on coastlines and farmlands, in red states and blue states. Billions of dollars in damage. Homes and memories washed away. Small businesses closed up for good. Crops and farmlands destroyed for the next generation family farmer. Just last year, the Defense Department reported that climate change is a direct threat to more than two-thirds of the military's operationally critical installations. And this could well be a conservative estimate. And so many climate and health calamities are colliding at once. It's not just a pandemic that keeps people inside , it's poor air quality. Multiple studies have shown air pollution is associated with an increased risk of death from Covid-19. Folks, we're in a crisis. Just like we need a unified national response to COVID-19, we need a unified national response to climate change. We need to meet this moment with the urgency it demands as we would during any national emergency. And from the crisis, we need to seize the opportunity to build back better than we were before.That's what this Administration will do. When we think about climate change, we think 'jobs.' Good-paying union jobs. A key plank of our Build Back Better economic plan is building a modern, climate-resilient infrastructure and clean energy future. We can put millions of Americans to work modernizing water, transportation, and energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme weather. When we think about renewable energy, we see American manufacturing, American workers, racing to lead the global market. We see farmers making American agriculture first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions and gaining new sources of income in the process. We see the small businesses and master electricians designing and installing innovative, energy-conserving buildings and homes. This will reduce electricity consumption and save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs. And we will challenge everyone to step up. We will bring America back into the Paris Agreement and put us back in the business of leading the world on climate change. The current Administration reversed the Obama-Biden fuel-efficiency standards and picked Big Oil companies over the American workers. Our Administration will not only bring those standards back , we will set new, ambitious ones that our workers are ready to meet. We see American workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations across the country. We see American consumers switching to electric vehicles through rebates and incentives. Not only that , the federal government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles. And we're going to harness the purchasing power of our federal government to make sure we are buying clean, electric vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in America. All together, this will mean one million new jobs in the American auto industry. And we'll do another big thing: put us on a path of achieving a carbon-pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 that no future president can turn back. Transforming the American electricity sector to produce power without carbon pollution will be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st Century, not to mention the benefits to our health and our environment. But we need to get to work right away. We'll need scientists at national labs, land-grant universities, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities to innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean electricity. We'll need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them. We'll need ironworkers and welders to install them. That's how we'll become the world's largest exporter of these technologies, creating even more jobs. We know how to do this. The Obama-Biden Administration rescued the auto industry and helped them retool. We made solar energy cost-competitive with traditional energy and weatherized more than a million homes. The Recovery Act made record clean energy investments , $90 Billion , on everything from smart grid systems to clean energy manufacturing. We will do it again , bigger, and faster, and better than before. We'll also build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that will benefit our communities three-times over by alleviating the affordable housing crisis, by increasing energy efficiency, and by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to homeownership. We'll create more than a quarter-million jobs right away, to do things like working toward plugging the 3.2 million abandoned oil and gas wells that the EPA says pose an ongoing threat to the health and safety of our communities. We'll launch a new, modern-day Civilian Climate Corps to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. And I believe that every American has a fundamental right to breathe clean air and drink clean water. But I know that we haven't fulfilled that right. No, we haven't fulfilled that right for a generation or more in places like Cancer Alley in Louisiana or along the Route 9 corridor right here in Delaware. Fulfilling this basic obligation to all Americans, especially in low-income white, Black, Brown, and Native American communities who too often don't have clean air and clean water is not going to be easy. But it is necessary. And we are committed to facing climate change by delivering environmental justice. These aren't pie-in-the-sky dreams. These are concrete, actionable solutions. And this team will get them done. For Secretary of the Interior, I nominate Congresswoman Deb Haaland. She's of the Pueblo people. A 35th-generation New Mexican. She's from a military family. Her mom, also Pueblo, served in the United States Navy. Her dad, Norwegian American, a Marine now buried in Arlington. A single mom, she raised her child while running a small business. When times were tough, they relied on food stamps. Congresswoman Haaland graduated from law school and got involved in politics. Two years ago, she became one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress. She serves on the Armed Services Committee, and Committee on Natural Resources, and Chairs the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands, where she's earned the respectof a broad coalition of people , from tribal leaders to environmental groups to labor. As the first Native American Cabinet Secretary in the history of the United States of America, she will be a true steward of our national parks, natural resources, and all of our lands. The federal government has long broken promises to Native American tribes who have been on this land since time immemorial. With her appointment, Congresswoman Haaland will help me strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship, and I am honored she accepted this critical role. For Secretary of Energy, I nominate Jennifer Granholm. The first woman to ever serve as Governor of Michigan. In 2009, she faced the collapse of a defining industry of her state and our nation. But I saw firsthand how she responded. She bet on the autoworkers. She bet on the promise of a clean energy future. Her leadership helped rescue the American auto industry, helped save one million American jobs, and helped bring Detroit back. Governor Granholm is just like the state she led so effectively for eight years: hard-working, resilient, and forward-thinking. Someone not only capable of solving urgent problems, but someone who sees the opportunities of the future always with her eyes on the needs and aspirations of working people. Throughout her career, she's worked with states, cities, business, and labor to promote a clean energy future with new jobs, new industries, cleaner and more affordable energy. Now, I'm asking her to bring that vision and faith in America to the Department of Energy. For Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, I nominate Michael Regan. A proud son of North Carolina, he turned a passion for exploring the woods and waters of the Inner Coastal Plain into a deep expertise in environmental science. He got his start at the EPA serving in both Democratic and Republican Administrations, working on everything from reducing air pollution to improving energy efficiency. He currently serves as Secretary of North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality,where he's brought people together across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to help build a new clean energy economy, creating quality jobs, and confronting climate change. He led the charge to clean up the Cape Fear River, contaminated for years by dangerous toxic chemicals. And he created North Carolina's first board of its kind to address environmental justice and equity. It helps lift up frontline and fenceline communities who had carried the burdens of industrial progress for too long, without sharing in the benefits. Michael would be the second African American official and first African American man to serve in this position. He shares my belief in forging consensus and finding common purpose. He is the leader who will reassert the EPA's place as the world's premier environmental protection agency that safeguards our planet, protects our lives, and strengthens our economy for all Americans. For Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, I nominate Brenda Mallory. An accomplished public servant. A brilliant environmental lawyer. A daughter of a working-class family who has dedicated her life to solving the most complex environmental challenges facing America. She has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, helping safeguard our public lands and helping communities manage their natural resources responsibly. As Chair of CEQ, I'm asking her to coordinate our environmental efforts across the entire federal government to solve some of the most persistent environmental problems America faces today. Brenda would be the first African American official to hold this critical position. We are fortunate that one of the most widely respected environmental leaders in the country accepted the call to serve again. To serve as the first-ever National Climate Advisor and lead the newly formed White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, I appoint Gina McCarthy. The fact I've asked a former EPA Administrator to take this role and lead this new office shows how serious I am. Gina's got more than 30 years of experience. She's a policy wonk and a people person. A problem-solver and coalition builder. As EPA Administrator, she was instrumental in carrying out the Obama-Biden Climate Action Plan. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Getting toxins out of the air we breathe. Conserving critical water sources. She led our effort to help lower carbon emissions of existing power plants and power plants of the future. And by doing the necessary work here at home, she helped us rally the world around the Paris Climate Accords. Today, I'm asking her to take a singular focus on carrying out our ambitious climate agendahere at home, while my Special Envoy John Kerry leads our climate efforts around the world. I'm grateful to work alongside her again. And to serve as Deputy National Climate Advisor, I appoint Ali Zaidi. He served as a top climate advisor to President Obama and me at the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council. He helped draft and implement our Climate Action Plan and secure the Paris Climate Agreement. He currently serves as New York's Deputy Secretary of Energy and Environment and the State's Chairman of Climate Policy and Finance. He's helping to create jobs generating solar and wind power, jobs building electric charging stations and a more modern grid, bold climate action grounded in science, economics, and public health. And, he's an immigrant from Pakistan who grew up in the Rust Belt, outside Erie, Pennsylvania. Ali knows we can beat the climate crisis with jobs. He knows we can deliver environmental justice and revitalize communities too often overlooked and forgotten. And every day he'll walk into the White House, knowing the world is looking for America to lead. To each of you, thank you for answering the call to serve. To your families, thank you. We could not do this without you or them. To the career civil servants at these agencies, we look forward to working with you to once again carry out your department's mission with honor and integrity. And to the American people , yes, the goals I've laid today are bold. The challenges ahead are daunting. But I want you to know that we can do this. We must do this. And we will do this. We are America. And there's nothing we can't do when we work together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. I'll now turn it over to the team, starting with our next Secretary of the Interior, Congresswoman Deb Haaland.",

         "I want to start off by saying a very big. Hello, Wisconsin. It's great to be with. I'll also say this. I have never spoken where I had so many people behind me. E have a whole stadium behind. I want to just thank everybody. It is a great turnout. They wanted a bigger space. They got a bigger space because seven days from now we're going to win this state and we are going to four MAWR. Incredible years in the White House. Thank you, Thistle. Election is a choice between a Trump super recovery or a Biden depression. That's what you're gonna have with the raise of taxes, the biggest tax increase in our history. It's ridiculous. It's a choice between a trump boom or a Biden locked down. Let's lock it all down. And by the way, speaking of lockdowns, let's get your governor toe. Open it up, Let's get him open. It's a choice between our plan to cut your taxes or even and I have to tell you, you know, we've given you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. You know, that biggest regulation cut in the history of our country and sleepy Joe Biden. His plan is to raise your taxes at a level that our country has never raised taxes before. Somehow, that doesn't work too well. Do you agree? I don't think so. I don't think so. I've never heard of it before, but that's okay. You can't hear of everything, right? All my life, I've watched people want to cut taxes. Here's the guys he's running on the basis of Let's raise everybody's taxes. Next week, Wisconsin's going to answer the call of history once again. We had a great victory here. Did we have a great Remember that four years ago? They said, Donald Thas won The state of Wisconsin has been a long time since Republican did that, but we're actually much higher now than we were then. We have a campaign that's actually more enthusiastic, and that was I would say, that had to be number one in history four years ago. But you know what? This is going to be the most important election in the history of our country because you see what's happening, the radical leftists and you're going to defeat Biden and dark money donors and corrupt special interest. One of the most important issues in this election is law and order. We say it long away. Joe Biden and his party incite violence and hatred against our police officers. And we're not doing that. No, we're not doing that. Remember the debate? The first debate? As which one. Did you like better the first one or the second one? Jesus book? Yeah, that's a fat. He said. Man, my man is there. Yep. Did anybody see the last one? Anybody watching? Seems to have had a very big impact. We learned a lot about him. He's number one. He's against oil deaths. Probably likes wind, but wind is very intermittent. Let's watch the president tonight on television. I'm sorry, darling. The winds not blowing Last night, Philadelphia was torn up by Biden supporting radicals, 30 police officers, Philadelphia police officers, great people. They were injured some badly. Biden stands with the rioters and I stand with the heroes of law enforcement. And you know what? They can do their job very easily. Just let them do their job. The Biden Harris plan would end cash bail. You know they wanna have cash bail so everyone just walks around, no matter what they do. Ends cash, bail freeing 400,000 dangerous criminals. It would slash police budgets all over the country. It would tie the hands of every police officer in the country, and they would a point. Anti police prosecutors in every community in America. I don't think that's for Wisconsin. We know each other well. Biden this often weak and too scared to be present. He doesn't want to be president. Let's face it, I have. You know, you got his bad body language. There's a lot of bad, but his men knows buddy language better than any man I know. That's a lot of bad body language from Joe. You know, he got out yesterday. You saw that because we're making speeches all over Pennsylvania. He got out and he got out of Delaware. He said, What's the closest point to Pennsylvania? It was just a few minutes from his basement, and he went and made a speech, and that was a mistake because I had to take him off the stage because they didn't. He didn't know where the hell he waas that didn't work out too well because he had a lid, you know, like a garbage Can you put it in the can. It's a lid. It's called the lid, but he doesn't want to be president. One thing about this job, you gotta want it. You gotta want it. This is tough and doing this. I don't usually say it, but I say it doing this on. Unlike Biden, who's made a fortune in politics, What a fortune. The press is not allowed to write about that, though, but Biden made a fortune. You know what? This has cost me billions of dollars, and you know, I could not be happier because we have done things that nobody else could have done in the 1st 3.5 years. There's been no administration that's done what we've done in the 1st 3.5 years with our military, with our vets, with regulations, with cutting taxes. Biden's running mate, the most liberal member in the U. S Senate, she makes Bernie Sanders look like he's a conservative, even urged their supporters to donate to a fund to bailout rioters in Minneapolis, where they had such problems until the National Guard went in and they stopped it. Would you say that was about what, 22 minutes it was all over, including an attempted cop killer. They wanted to bail them out. The policies will set cop killers free. We believe if you murder a police officer, you should get the death penalty. And I know you're a statement. You murder a police officer you saw a month ago. The two young officers sitting in a car and the guy comes up. Now you do that stuff and you can't get away with it. When the Violent Mob came. Thio Kenosha. You know Kenosha. Everybody know Kenosha. Biden oppose sending in the National Guard. We sent in the National Guard and we saved Kenosha. We saved Kenosha. Kenosha wouldn't be standing and I got a lot of credit. Thank you to the sheriff and so many others for their support. They've actually came out and supported me. Thank you very much. Where's the sheriff? Busy around here someplace. What a hell of a shelf. Thank you very much. That's great. I appreciate too. That's the first time you ever did it. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. It has good man. Good man. It took generations to build the America that we know and love. But if the radical left gain power. It would take them only a matter of months to burn it down, tear it down or destroy it. I'm the only one standing between you and the left wing mob. I hate to tell you, there aren't too many of us, but we're standing in your Second Amendment and many other things, right? Biden is not only declared war on one police, I mean, you know, it really is. My father told me a long time. Don't use the word cops, because the word cops, that's a little slang always calling police, so I never use it. You know, I see cops, but sometimes it's not bad. Sheriff, let me ask you cops or police, or doesn't it matter if it's done with the heart? Who cares, right? Right. If it's done with the heart. So, like I said, he declared war on the cops and it's not working out too well. You're gonna see something. You're going to see a giant red wave on Tuesday. You're going to see a red wave like they've never seen before. And they saw a very big one. I'll tell you what, they got a glimpse on four years ago because that was I remember. They said, Where did these people come from? Where did they come from? They're great Americans. They don't want anything. They just want that level playing field. And they came out and they voted. And this is gonna be bigger. This is gonna be bigger and they know it. They know they know it. They don't like to report it. They see what's happening. They see what's happening. Mike, Don't they get it? It's gonna be very big, and it's gonna be beautiful and it's probably going to start. It doesn't have to start on Tuesday. It could sort earlier. Early voting. You want to be there? You know these ballots. You see what I write about the ballots? It's messed up like you wouldn't believe. Now they say we'd like Thio get the ballots and maybe get him within a few days of the election and we'll take 10 days to count them up. Good. Let's let the whole world wait while you count your balance. And you know what happens while they're counting them? They're dumping more balance in their okay. Where they Where did they come from? Now they have to. We had a great ruling right here. We had a great ruling, right? Got that? Yesterday, Supreme Court said No, that's your date. That's it's called November 3rd. That's your date, right? But sleepy Joe declared war on American workers, and Biden spent the last 47 years outsourcing your jobs. You got hit hard, opening your borders. You don't have borders, you don't have a country and sacrificing American blood and treasure and endless foreign ridiculous wars. Countries most of you, including even most of the people they never even heard of these countries. We're bringing them all back home. You know that, right? They're all coming back home. Afghanistan, Iraq, keeping some in Syria. What if you don't mind? We're keeping the oil. You know, they should have done that. They should have done that with Iraq. Remember, I said, don't go into Iraq, But if you go and at least keep the oil, we didn't keep the oil. Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization. He repeatedly tried to slash Medicare and Social Security. He's a shill, in a sense, for foreign countries. You got to take a look at this guy's record. Of course, right now he has no idea where he is. That's a That's a That's an entirely different problem. That's a very big, different problem. But who the hell look, we have to say it like it is? Hey, we have the greatest country in the world. We have potential like no country has way. Can't play games way can't play games way can't. Besides that, he's not a nice guy. Okay, just so you know, he was never a nice guy, so I feel better. He was a nice guy. I wouldn't say. That's thank you very much. Thank you. Decade after decade, Biden twisted his knife into the back of Wisconsin workers. But workers throughout the United States You don't have to take my word for it. For a special group of people. The people of Wisconsin. I spent a lot of money on this crazy video. Look at this and you're going to see. And I hope that people back here can see it. Can you see it too, I hope. Oh, that's terrible. All right. You'll take my word for it. Go ahead, play. I'm My problem is I voted for NAFTA. I'm supporting NAFTA because I think it is a positive thing to do, and I do not pretend to be an expert on international trade matters. Trade agreements like NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China, which forced American workers to compete against people of making pennies an hour, has resulted in the loss of 160 0 jobs. The president is absolutely right when he says that China has been cheating for 25 years and that Bill Clinton did and didn't do enough about it. George W. Bush didn't do enough about it. Barack Obama didn't do enough about a rising China is an incredibly positive development for not only China but the United States and the rest of the world. Rising in China is a positive, positive development. It is in our self interest that China continue to prosper. We want to see China rise. China is a great nation, and we should hope for the continued expansion. China is not our enemy way. Talk about China is our competitors. We should be helping China is gonna be our lunch bizarre. They're not bad folks, folks. China is not a problem allowing China into the World Trade Organization, which he supported. Extending most favored nation status to China, which you supported that those steps allowed China to take advantage of the United States by using our own open trade deals against us. Do you think, in retrospect, that you were naive about China? Who doesn't he deserve some credit for that? It's better. The USMC is better than NAFTA. It is better than NAFTA. I never said I oppose fracking. You said tape. I did show the tape. Put it on your website. I'll put it on, put it on the website. Would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking in a Biden administration? No way would work it out. We would make sure it's eliminated. Guaranteed. We're gonna end fossil fuel no more, No new fracking. I gradually move away from fracking. Andi. I think it's critically important on day one that we end any fossil fuel leases on public lands. Well, what about stopping fracking and stopping pipeline infrastructure? And there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. I have one final would be closed down. Erlinda, would you close down the other way? Transition from the oil industry? Yes. Oh, transition. That is a big in terms of business. That's the biggest thing. Because basically, what he's saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that? Texas. We remember that. Pennsylvania. Oklahoma. Now, to be fair, maybe Biden's not telling us because he's forgotten his own plans. Watch Biden staff quickly swoop in to shuffle them along during a quickie. Escaped the basement trip to Pennsylvania. Here's the deal. One of the things that that is important is that keep in mind, although they're gonna vote on, uh, Barrett. That was terrifying. What kind of country? We're gonna be? Four more years of George, uh, Georgia. He gonna find ourselves in a position where if Trump gets elected, we're gonna be We're gonna be in a different world. That was yesterday. That was all yesterday. So that took place yesterday. Every day we could put up another treat. It's the whole thing is ridiculous. The whole thing, You know, until the plague came in from China, I didn't even have a race. And then it came in and we did a great job. We saved millions of lives. Two million lives. 2.2 million. Who was supposed to this'll guy, You know he didn't see Oh, don't ban it. Your xenophobic Don't ban China. Don't ban China. This is in January very early on very, very early. Everybody said don't band. I'm not blaming anybody, but they all said, Don't bad. I said It's a heavily infected country and starting from there I banned China. Then I banned Europe with all of the problems they were having with Spain and Italy and France of everybody. And I banned I bad Europe. And 2.5 months later he was saying, Don't ban and then he runs for president. He looks out because Pocahontas decided to stay in. So she took a lot of votes away from Bernie, Not too many. She didn't do too well, but she took enough away that he ends up winning on Super Tuesday. Right? And all of a sudden I got this guy running and he starts complaining that I should have moved faster. But he was 2.5 months behind, and I said, That's gonna be hard to explain, but I have to explain it to people. One thing nice is when you put this thing up here, saves you a lot of words, right? It saves you a lot of words. And then the other thing, remember, for a year we will not frack. Now it affects you because of your energy costs and all of the things that affects everybody. We're right now. Energy independence. It's a great thing first time, but it really effects. Can you imagine Texas, Pennsylvania, The different places? Ohio. So many places. So many places. North Dakota. Can you imagine? Take Texas. I mean, he's a good soil. He's against guns and he's against religion, right? Other than that, he's wonderful. He's just perfect. And then they say it's a very close race in Texas. I don't think so. Year against year against oil, guns and God, you don't have a close race in Texas. I don't think, but they said it the same thing four years ago that Texas is too close to call. It's going to be a very, very tough race for Donald Trump that it was Donald right now, they call me President out of respect, I'm sure for the office it will be a very, very, very tough race. I mean, the polls have closed in Texas. Donald Trump has won. The state of Texas was like, Well, they're one thing. They don't do that unless you have a landslide. So we had like, and now they do the same thing again. Well, this time at least they say I have a little lead. How can you have a little lead when I'm the oil person Who we needed to fire up your factories and you just we can't. They don't even know how to do it. They have, like, a O C plus three. They say, Okay, we'll get rid of all fossil fuels. We have a problem in Wisconsin. We're doing very well. We have a lot of factories. We have a lot of plans. How are we gonna fire him up? She has no clue. She has no clue. I don't even think she studied it. It may be in high school. She studied it, but probably not in college. Did she go to college? Tell me, did she? Because I don't know. I don't know her background, but it is not heavy into the environment. All of a sudden, she comes up with the green New Deal, and these people all did because they have to, because the radical left wants him. The green New Deal will cost $100 trillion. If we have 100 perfect years the greatest years of the history of our country, we can't make it. With 100 trillion spent on the Green New Deal in 2016 Wisconsin voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider is president who is finally putting America first. And if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician. It's one of the reasons I was elected. E was a politician. I probably wouldn't have been elected right. If I don't always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for you, and I'm fighting for you harder than any president has ever fought for you. Together, we'll continue to fight for American workers, support our police, defend our second amendment, which is under siege. But don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. It's fine, but it is under siege. Secure our borders and you know the wall is upto over 400 miles right now. We have very soon over four. We're gonna have it finished very soon. They don't talk about it anymore. You know, They used to go. He will never get it built because that was like you could The Democrat Party were so against it. They said it was obsolete. Use drones so we could watch everybody pour into the border. Let's send a drone up there. Right. Walls and wheels, right? Walls and wheels never get obsolete. There's about the only two things I know of that don't get obsolete. Everything else is obsolete. About 15 minutes after you figure it out and ensure mawr products air proudly stamped with that wonderful, beautiful phrase made in the Yusa right way will deliver record, prosperity, epic job growth and a safe vaccine that eradicates the virus and quickly ends this pandemic. And, you know, with fake news everything is Covic. Covic, Covert Covert. I had it. Here I am, right. I had it. First lady had it. Baron had it, but Baron had it for about 12 seconds. Young, young and immune. System young. No, it z co vid you turn on the news covert Cove in. You know when they're going to stop talking about it so much November 4th. You're right, November 4. It's a whole crazy thing. I mean, it's too complicated to explain. These people are very corrupt, very dishonest. But they got a lot of problems. On November 4th, you'll hear we're doing extremely well and you'll see it. You'll see, you know that You always say that Europe look a Europe Look at Europe Well, first of all, they count their cases totally differently. But look at your well. They have a big spike and you know what? It's going to go down. And we had a spike in Miami. We had a spike in Texas, Arizona. It's all way down to very low numbers, but I'll tell you all they want to talk about is co vid. But the good news on the fourth, they'll stop talking. You watch, they'll stop talking. You get out that red wave. Just get out. We have to win this election. This is the most important election we've ever had. We can't let this radical left socialist group takeover on. I've been saying it now for a long time because I see it. This this inclination by a group of people, Our country will never be a socialist nation. We will never become a socialist nation. Normal life will fully reason. That's all we want is normal life seven months ago, right? We have the greatest economy in the history of our country. Everybody was doing well, best numbers we've ever had. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You see what's happening. You see how it's being built up. And by the way, I'd love to do stimulus. But crazy Nancy doesn't wanna do it. She wants to get bailout money for her Democrat run states that are high crime and doing badly. And I spoke for Wisconsin. What? I said, No, thank you, Nancy. Have a good time. We'll get big stimulus right after the elections over. Hopefully, we can take back the house, too. Be nice. Get rid of her. Get rid of her speaker, will get Kevin and their Kevin would be good. You know who Kevin is? Kevin McCarthy. If Biden and the Democrat Socialists were elected, they will bury your regular. You know what's going on right with your regulations. I've got your regulations down to a level, but we can go further. We have statutory requirements were going further. They'll bury your really your family and yourself and regulations terminate religious liberty, dissolve our borders, indoctrinate our Children with that really bad stuff that they want to teach in schools, which we've largely ended. But it could be started again and destroy the suburbs beyond repair. Suburban women. You're gonna love me. You better love me. Did you see 60 minutes the other night? I always joke. I say suburban women. I'm getting rid of that regular. You know, there's a regulation that essentially destroyed the suburbs. Okay, It would have. You know who was in charge of it? Who would have been Cory Booker? Good luck, Corey. He's another beauty. He's another. We deal with the real beauties, but we had a regulation where they can build low income housing and projects in in the neighborhood near you, You know, right in the neighborhood, near you, in the suburbs, right? So the fake news was saying We think that Donald Trump is having problems with suburban women. I said, Why? Because I'm going to stop crying from going to the suburbs because you know, Antifa and the anarchists they view the suburbs is next. That's what they would like. So the suburban woman wants law and order. They want safety and they don't want a regulation that's going to destroy the suburbs. And then I listen to these people talk about how so Four years ago, they talked about the same thing. They said women will not be voting for Donald Tand then after about four hours and they declared total victory for Trump, you know, they said he cannot get 2 to 70. He cannot. This was in the afternoon. He can, and for about six months before that, by the way, didn't just started there. Donald Trump cannot get you need to 70 right? Cannot get to 270. He cannot get. And they were right. We got 306 way picked up a place called Wisconsin that helped me. Oh, that wasn't That wasn't high on the list of victories. Now it is, but we just know it just came out. Were leading by like, three points. That's good. They won't report. They they won't report that they look at 30 polls. They look at 30 polls. Some of them are totally fake. Some of them are sick coz, right? They look at Paul's, where they interview 38% Democrats, 21% Republicans. I said, That doesn't sound like to fair to me and they'll say Trump is down by five. Well, if I'm down by five when they're doing 38 to 21 that means I'm winning in a landslide. What kind of polls are these now? Seriously, what kind of polls are these? People are crazy. Joe Biden will delay the vaccine. Postponed therapies, prolonged the pandemic. Shutter your schools, open you schools, please bankrupt your small businesses and shut down our country. He will destroy our country. And by the way, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. I said that a long time ago, except what I originally said that I had no, you know, I felt it. I felt it was bad. I just felt it was an instinct. It can't be worse than the problem itself. So the shutdown, with alcoholism, with drugs, with abuse, with suicides, with all the things that happened, it's worse. You can't do this. You gotta get your governors to open up. There aren't many of them. There aren't many of them now. But you gotta now one of the reasons this is another one on. We'll go to the fourth, right. November 4th. They'll be announcing We're opening our ST one of them stupidly, like, three weeks ago. Now, you know, we think we're gonna open probably around November 4th. How about that, genius? Okay, no, there'll be alot be open around a couple of days after the election. Biden even wants toe lock down young and healthy Americans. Yet for those under age 50 the recovery rate is 99.98%. Think of that 99.98 And for school kids, it's lower than it's better than that. Biden's cruel and sensors lockdowns would cause countless deaths from suicide and from all of the problems we have. And we would have problems and economic people lose their jobs. They lose their jobs, they're small businesses go out or they work for small businesses or big businesses that go out, get open up our states. We got to tell you, Governor, we gotta open up our states Does anybody like your governor? Do you like him? Okay, let's have Who likes the governor? Is he gonna win re elections? Who does not like the governor? All right. It's interesting. Lots of lot, Governor. They're gonna open up now. A lot of governors that did this, you know, Michigan. She the only one that it was allowed toe go around. And Rome was her husband, right? He was allowed to go fishing and sailing. Nobody else was there to stay locked up in their house. But we want a Supreme Court case against them. They found it unconstitutional that she locked down the state of Michigan. I just left Michigan. I gave a speech in 32 degree weather in the rain. And they're great people. They're strong people. So I said, You know what I'll do? I won't put on a hat, Okay? And I'll just stand there in Iran on. I'll freeze it. I'll make a speech. But I'll tell you, there was such love. It was incredible. We're winning. We're winning Michigan, too. No, no, e had a nice hat. I was gonna put it on and they were waiting for four or five hours. I mean, I said I feel so guilty. I mean, I wasn't there, but to get there very early. Like probably some of you. You got here very early. Right, Elise? Front rowers I know. Got here. I know the front rowers get here very early. I mean, we have it where they get 34 days in advance. They were you here? 34 days. Yeah, I know. Will you vote? You promise? You voted for Trump? She's great. Now we have great people we've never had. Four years ago, we had the most enthusiastic campaign anyone's ever seen. Probably there ever waas this this campaign. And I never thought I'd say it has mawr enthusiasm mawr support that we did four years ago. Uh, because, you know, four years ago, I was a business guy. I was successful. I was very successful. I came and I said I was gonna dio get it out of your sister. So four years ago I came and I saw trade. I probably trade was you know, I just drove me crazy. We're losing all our factories, closing all our factories. They're moving to Mexico. They're making it in China. They're doing all these things. A lot of people, a lot of places moved up to Canada. Canada was very tough with us, But a lot of I saw this. That's really the main reason I ran. But I saw it all happening. It was so easy to see. I saw it all happening, and that's probably the main reason I ran. But four years ago, I was just saying, I'm gonna cut your taxes. I'm gonna cut regulations. I'm gonna rebuild your military. I'm gonna dual the things I said. And actually, I did more because, like Space Force, we opened up Space Force. I never said I was gonna do that. I learned that after watching Russia and China and everything else, I learned that after us here. But I never took one of these people right back there. Said he may be the only politician that actually did Mawr than he promised during the campaign. I believe that's true. So we have. So we have actually Mawr enthusiasm because I did everything. I mean, I said the wall, the wall was I mean, the wall was just a very expensive. The Border Patrol wanted a certain way very expensive. I mean, they're right. They wanted vision. They wanted steel. They wanted rebar. They wanted concrete inside and they said, You know what? I'll do it. I want to do it the way you want it. I don't want to give you any excuses for doing a bad job in the border G if you only would have built the wall right? But all of the things that I said I did everything I said I did, and that gives this campaign more energy than a guy that was successful. That said, Hey, I'm going to do a lot of things because you've been hearing that for years from politicians and they don't do it, they don't get the job. As I said about buying the other night at the debate, Joe, you're all talk and no action and it's true on I'd look at him and say, Joe, why didn't you do it? You know so well, we should have done this. We should have been I said, Joe, you've been there for 47 years and you left 3.5 years ago. It's not like you left 30 years ago. You left 3.5 years ago and I only ran because of you, Joe, because if you and Obama did a good job, I wouldn't have run. I mean, there would have been no reason. And if I did, I probably wouldn't have been able to win, so I only ran. It was quite it was quite insulting to him, but that's the way it is. Biden had no plan. No idea. He didn't have a clue. He just wants to lock up this country. I mean, he really does. He's gonna lock it up if one guy walks up and says, Sir, I think we should close up our country. Okay, that sounds good to be while letting rioters and looters run wild. Or is Joe calls them peaceful protesters. I call you protesters. You know why? Because there's a legal definition. You can't have a political rally. They did that to keep me out, right? So I said, Oh, I see. You're protesters. The only thing you can do is protest. Because they wanted to protect anarchists, rioters, people that were burning down your stores. So you have the absolute right to protest. So I call this a friendly protests. Okay, Officially, not a rally. A thistle is not a rally. It's a friendly protest. Okay, Now we've gotten over the legal hurdle, haven't we? These people don't believe in science. They believe in whatever gives them powered. Whatever gives them control. The Biden plan will crush you and crush your family. We will crush the virus and make our success make this country mawr successful than it's ever been. We have that kind of potential. We have the foundation set. You see what's happening. You see the kind of numbers we're doing. We're going to make our country mawr successful quickly than it's ever been. When the China plague arrived, we moved heaven and earth to fight the disease. We airlifted medical supplies, pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reduced the fatality rate 85%. Think of the 85. And now it's actually higher than that. Well, here I am. I mean, I'm here, right? I said, give me that stuff. Whatever the hell it is, Doctor, I want it. Next day I woke up and I felt like Superman. Right? I said, Get me the hell out of here. I have to go toe Wisconsin tonight on saved Over two million lives are excess mortality rate has been 42% less than Europe's. Think of that. 42% and I'm working and we're working with your very closely look. They have a problem. We all It should have never been allowed to leave China ever. It should have never been allowed. It didn't go once it got Wuhan Wuhan province. It never got out, but it came to the U. S. A. And Europe and the rest of the world. I'm working to make the breakthrough treatment I received. So what we're doing is we're going to make the Regeneron and Eli Lilly a great company has a similar anti body drug antibody drug, and we're going to make that available to people that needed free. All I know is I didn't feel great. And after I took that, I woke up the next morning and I wanted I tell you, I felt like I could take on the world. I said, Let me at it. And here we are, standing here Freezing. Thanks are relentless efforts. 97% of all current emergency room visits are for something other than the virus. You don't hear these numbers from the fake news? Think of that 97% and we're on track to deliver 100 million doses of safe vaccine. And I say we're turning the corner. We're turning the corner. We're rounding like this racetrack. Look at this is perfect. We're rounding the curve. We will vanquish the virus. And by the way, we're gonna have the vaccine. Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, Modern, great companies. And others, too. We have the vaccine. We're gonna have it very soon. Like very soon. We're going to deliver it. But without it also, we're rounding the curve. We're rounding the corner. It's happening. We're gonna emerge stronger than ever before. Biden's made a corrupt bargain. And the Democrats, in exchange for his party's nomination, he has handed control of his party over to a rage, Phil, Socialists and Marxists and left wing extremists. You see it? You see it in Portland? How about Portland? We could solve that problem in. That's a half A Now, er anarchists. You know what happens to him, right? They go back home to mom and Dad, and they also stay in the basement. That's what they have in common with Jill. Well, no Joe in that one clip, you know, that was yesterday. That took place. That was what happened? He was in the basement. He heard that we were doing really well in Pennsylvania, which we are at least two or three points up. Doesn't sound like much. You know what happens with us. They'll say he's three points up and then you win by, like, 10. There's a lot of hidden votes out there. I don't know if I'm supposed to be complemented by that or not, but they're hidden votes. They don't want to talk. See, they are. They know what they are. All action, right? They call that all actions. If Biden wins the flag burning radicals on the streets will be running for you know that they'll be running your government. They'll be running your government this election day. You must stop the anti American radicals by delivering Joe Biden and those far left Democrats, all Democrats, a thundering defeat. This has to be a big defeat so we can end. It just ended, and Joe Biden, as you see, is a corrupt politician. He wants to send your jobs to China while his family rakes in millions from the Chinese Communist Party. Million's on. He gets money from Ukraine, he gets money from Russia. How about Ukraine? His son sits on the board. No energy experience, No nothing. Didn't have a job. Father becomes vice president. He becomes in charge of Ukraine. Son goes on. The board of Karisma goes on the border. Paris. 183,000 month. Would you say that's good? Would you say that's good. If Biden wins, China wins. China will own the use. A. If this happens and they don't want me to win, they don't want me. We charge them tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs. We never took 10 cents from China, and now we gave out. Where is that? Please go. Where's Hunter? Where is Hunter, by the way? Come to think of it, how about the laptop from hell? Let's call the laptop from them on. Then you see shifty shift. It was Russia that created the laptop. It was Russia. Shifty shift. He says it with a straight face water melon shaped head like a water. It was Russia, I said. Oh, no. Here we go again. When we win, you win. Wisconsin wins and America wins. That's what's goingto happen. We're joined today by members of Wisconsin manufacturers and commerce. That really helped us with this location. And, you know, we're gonna be out of the airport. But the governor made it very difficult. So I said, That's alright. Get a location. Friendly people and your state's there really are your states Chamber of Commerce. And I wanna thank them very much. Where are you folks? Where are you guys? What a group of people. Where? What the hell are you? I met your there, but there they are. Good job. You did. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Good job. I said, how are we doing? They said, sir, you're gonna win easy. That's pretty good. They know the They slightly know the area. I'm thrilled to receive their first ever presidential endorsement. They've been around a long time, and they gave us. We've got a lot of endorsements, Got a lot of newspaper endorsements today to a lot of them all over the country. And every virtually every law enforcement group has given us the endorsement. Even New York's finest. They've never endorsed a presidential candidate, and they wanna be given back. We've got to respect our law enforcement. We've gotta let him do what they have to do. Also with us. His candidate for Congress, Derek Van Orden, is terrific. Quiz. Derek. Derek. Good luck. I hear good things, Derek. I hear good things. Derek Van Orden, please vote for him when his competition is not good. Not good. And also, state GOP Chairman Andrew hit Andrew. Thank you. Are we winning? Andrew, please. If we don't win, we're gonna fire you so fast. Uh, I hear good. Yeah. Just get out that vote. Get out the vote. Together, we built the greatest economy in history, and now we're doing it again. Make America great. Again. Again. Right again. Again. See all those hats. Those hats are obsolete. It's make America great again. Again. We increased middle class family income over $6000 mawr than five times thens made under the last administration. Think of that in a short period of time. African American, Hispanic, American, Asian American unemployment reached their lowest levels ever recorded since April. We created a record 11.4 million jobs. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and proudly signed the brand new U. S. M. C A into law. That's gonna be a big deal just just kicked in Wisconsin, dairy farms were decimated under the Obama and Biden nightmare. They were decimated. And now you are doing very well. And, you know, Canada took advantage of you very much. You know that, right? Not anymore. Under the U S. M c a r dairy exports to Canada are expected to surge by at least 100%. We got rid of the tariffs. You know the tariffs. You know, they used to charge. You didn't know that you like the song o Canada, right? Hockey game. Nice song O Canada. Their national anthem, right? By the way, they stand for nationalism. Are people have to stand for our national anthem? They have to stay, but Canada treated us badly. 287% tariff. Can you believe that? Think of it. I learned about that. I said it's time to get out of that crazy NAFTA. NAFTA was a terrible thing When GM went bankrupt. Biden and Obama, through the workers of Delphi Corporation to the wolves, their pensions were wiped out. I signed in order to restore the pensions of Delphi and others and health care benefits promised the workers and these air workers in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin that got really promised a lot of things and it never happened. We took care of it. I will never let anyone rip off our great American worker. They were treated very badly with a lot of promises from Biden and Obama under my By the way you see this, you see the people that get for the crowds. Obama was up. He drew flies. Today, flies do nobody dead court, you know the cars are honking, right? Hong Kong, Kong, Let's go home. I never saw anything like this. They have cars. They have, like 12 cars. Now they have circles. There's a bigger circles for cars together. I never saw anything like it. Obama has no crowd. I thought he had, like a crowd, right? He doesn't have anything. The only one that has smaller crowds. A sleepy Joe Biden. He's got nobody and the press doesn't like covering our crowds. We have the opposite. We have so many people, they don't like it, but they never show. They never show that nobody. Joe was speaking yesterday. There was nobody there before they carried him off the stage. Think of it. He got nervous speaking to nobody. But that wasn't nervous. That was another problem. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U. S. History. My opponent's insane immigration plan completely eliminates US borders. By implementing nationwide catch and release, he would make every you know that is You catch a criminal murderer rapist, You catch. I mean, you have to release them into the United States. Then within two or three years, they're supposed to come back for a trial. We had an argument during the debate. I said, Sleepy Joe. They don't come back. Yes, they do. They proudly come back. No, no, Joe, they're murderers. They don't come back here. I turned out to be right, but, you know, he would make every community into a sanctuary city for violent criminals. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U. S. Military. You know that, right? You were a big beneficiary, this state. Ah, lot of business in the state, including nearly $6 billion to save the historic shipyard. Marinette Marine. You know that, right? And they're great. I was there four or five months ago. I was watching. They built beautiful, Beautiful. It looks like a yacht with lots of weapons on it. The only difference is you got rockets all over the damn thing. But it is beautiful. We killed the leader of Isis, al Baghdadi. We took out the world's number one terrorist. Soleimani is dead Way took out 100% of the Isis caliphate. Also, when I took over when I took over, it was a mess. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. $150 billion.1.8 billion in cash. You know, we got nothing. I recognize the true capital of Israel and open the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And instead of never ending wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East. We're doing it. It's like it's like working out really well. Three countries already, and many are lined up there. All wanting to get in a vote for Republicans is a vote for the American dream. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln. It's a vote for the American dream on. In conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It's already happening. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States right here in Wisconsin. Way will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. You don't want the sanctuary. We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Very important. Supreme Court. You got to do that. You've got to remember a lot of people think that's why I got elected because of the Supreme Court. And we've got already three great justices Amy yesterday. And by the end of the first time we have close to three, maybe more. But approximately 300 federal judges, including Court of Appeals, judge the record. It's a record we will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. So the $2.5 trillion the greatest rockets and missiles hydro sonic, the greatest in the world. They go seven times faster than what we have today. We have tanks, we have planes, we have bombers, We have submarines. We've rebuilt our military. We have the greatest. We have the greatest equipment, the greatest military force in the world. Russia, China, everybody. They are envious. Nobody thought we could do this and we've done it all. It's a lot of it's made right here, but all made in the Yusa, all made in the USA. Our nuclear is now in tippy top shape and just hope, just hope that we never have to use it. That's Ah, we will end surprise Medical building Require price transparency already signed January 1st. That goes into effect. Lower drug prices, even further. Favorite nations. Nobody can believe I did it. We're going to get the lowest prices in the world and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. America will land. The first woman in the moon in the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars and NASA right now is the talk of the world is a space center again. It was closed and a mess when I took over. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school way will teach our Children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag on We will live by the timeless words of our national motto. In God we trust, right? For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Wisconsin. That's what we're doing. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, even grab your boss if you have Thio. Come on, boss. You got to go out and get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. Got to get out. This is a thing you gotta do. Just remember the great Red Wave. It's now just starting to form is and they know it's coming. They know it's coming. We didn't come this far and fight this hard to surrender our country back to the corrupt Washington swamp. On November 3rd, we must finish the job, drain the swamp, go out and vote. Could be before November 3rd. Go out and vote from Green Bay to lacrosse from Madison till Milwaukee and from Janesville, too. Right here in West Salad Way. Inherit the legacy of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their hearts, sweat and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world.

         "HELLO. HELLO. HELLO. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IT IS GOOD TO BACK HERE IN ERIE. I WOULD TO SAY HELLO TO ALL OF ERIE. TO ALL LOCAL ELECTED LEADERS HERE ARE JOINING US HERE. AND TO YOUR NEXT SENATOR, WE NEED TO TURN OUT AND SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATS DOWN THE LINE. FOLKS, LOOK. I WENT TO THINK , I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. FOR EVERYONE AT THE UA FOR HOSTING THIS INCREDIBLE TRAINING FACILITY. I AM SO THINK TO OF EARNED THE ENDORSEMENT OF UA. YOU HAVE PROUD PLUMBERS AND MORE BEHIND ME THAN I COULD POSSIBLY THANK YOU FOUR. I WANT TO THANK RICK FOR SHARING HIS STORY AND BEING A PART OF A CONVERSATION THIS YEAR, HE SHARED HIS STORY WITH AMERICA. RICK, DELAWARE IS THOUGHT OF AS BEING A GREAT CORPORATE ENTITY AND CHEMICAL FACILITIES AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS, BUT WE HAVE A $4 BILLION AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. A LOT OF FARMERS ARE BEING HURT REALLY BADLY. FARMERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE BEING GUIDED BY THE PRESIDENT-ELECT WAS PROMISES. OUR FARMERS AND UNION MEMBERS WHO DO AN HONEST DAYS WORK, SEE THE PRESIDENT FOR HIS PROMISES AND WHAT THEY ARE. THANK YOU, RICK, FOR YOUR OP ED THAT YOU WROTE LAST YEAR. A BUNCH OF HOT AIR AND COLD WIND. FOLKS, THIS IS IT. THE ELECTION IS HERE. THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE MORE STARK, AND THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER. AFTER MY DEBATE IN CLEVELAND LAST, I TOOK A TRAIN. I HAVE WRITTEN A LOT. , I HAVE RATED IT A LOT. I HEARD THE SAME STORY, EVERYWHERE AROUND THE COUNTRY. YOU ARE TRYING YOUR BEST, BUT IT NEVER FEELS LIKE ENOUGH. YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, YOU ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A FAIR SHOT. THAT IS HOW MY DAD FELT WHEN WE HAD TO LEAVE SCRANTON. HE WAS IN SALES, HE WAS NOT IN THE COAL MINES. THEY TELL ME THAT MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS THE FIRST ELECTED IN THE STATE SENATOR , OUR MEMBER SAYING THAT HE MADE THAT WALK THE A LOT OF YOU KNOW HERE IN ERIE. TO TELL HIS KIDS THAT WE CANNOT PLAY AND THAT LITTLE LEAGUE BALL GAME ANYMORE. WE HAVE TO LEAVE, DAD DOES NOT HAVE A JOB. I REMEMBER HIM TAKING US HOME, MY MOM AND THE THREE CHILDREN AT THE TIME, HOME TO MY GRAND POPS. HOW MUCH PRIDE IT MUST HAVE COST HIM. HE STARTED COMMUTING EVERY WEEKEND, 157 MILES DOWN IN DELAWARE WHERE HE HAD GROWN UP. WE END UP IN CLAREMONT DELAWARE AND WENT TO WILMINGTON WHERE MY DAD GOT A SALES JOB. IT TOOK ABOUT FOUR YEARS TO BUILD A DECENT MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD A HOME. IT WAS NOT EASY FOR HIM. HE HAD AN EXPRESSION. HE SAID JOEY, I DO NOT EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS. BUT AT LEAST UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNMENT TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW IS FOR THE PRESIDENT TO EXACERBATE THE PROBLEMS. MORE THAN 10,000 ARE DEAD. WE LOSE ANYWHERE FROM 700 TO 1000 PEOPLE DEBT. , PEOPLE DEAD. WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS TOLD THAT A THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERY DAY, HE SAID IT IS WHAT IT IS. THAT IS BECAUSE HE IS WHO HE IS. 175 CASES , 175,000 CASES RIGHT HERE PENNSYLVANIA. WHEN YOU LOSE A CHILD AND LOOK AT THE EMPTY CHAIR AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE AT NIGHT. MY HEART GOES OUT TO EVERYONE STRUGGLING AND THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS. SIMPLE NEGLECT ON THE PART AT THIS ADMINISTRATION. MANY JOBS HAVE NOT COME BACK. TEMPORARY LAYOFFS HAVE TURNED INTO PERMANENT LAYOFFS. WE ARE STILL DOWN ON THE MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE THE CRISIS STARTED. MORE THAN 40,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENCY SINCE HOOVER THAT IS GOING TO END UP LEAVING OFFICE THAN WITH FEWER JOBS THAN HE STARTED OFFICE. THIS IS CALLED A K-SHAPED RECOVERY. EVERYBODY IN THE MIDDLE AND BELOW, IT IS GOING DOWN. THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE. ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE SACRIFICED TO KEEP US GOING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND BY THE MOST PEOPLE RECOVERY IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THIS IS A STARTLING FACT TO MEET. , TO ME. THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC MADE 300 BILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. 100 INDIVIDUALS MADE $300 BILLION THIS YEAR. THE BOTTOM HALF GOT THIS SLIDE DOWN. THIS PRESIDENT CAN ONLY SEE THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. I SEE IT FROM SCRANTON AND CLAREMONT, FROM REAL , FOR R EAL. I SEE IT FROM ERIE. MY PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON THE WORKING PEOPLE. THE ABOUT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW WHO GOT UP THIS MORNING AND HAD THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION. HOWDY, I KNOW THAT WE NEED FOUR NEW TIRES, BUT WE CANNOT DO IT RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE TO WAIT. I KNOW WE JUST LOST OUR INSURANCE, BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE OK. WE ARE GOING TO HANG IN THERE. OR, HAVING TO MAKE A CHOICE, LITERALLY A CHOICE BETWEEN GETTING A PRESCRIPTION OR PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. IF I SAID THAT 10 YEARS AGO, YOU WOULD LOOK AT ME LIKE I WAS WRITING A FICTION STORY. BUT THAT IS THE TRUTH. THOSE ARE THE DECISIONS THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING TODAY AND RIGHT NOW. INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS PUT OUT BY HIGHLY RESPECTED WALL STREET FIRM, PROJECTS THAT MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN IS GOING TO CREATED 80.6 MILLION JOBS IN FOUR YEARS , 18.6 MILLION. I DOUBLE CREATES 7 MILLION MORE JOBS THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. HERE IS HOW IT WORKS. I AM NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON ANYBODY MAKING LESS THAN $40,000. , $400,000. FOR THOSE MAKING MORE THAN THAT, I WILL ASK THE WEALTHY TO BEGIN TO PAY. 91 OF THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES TODAY PAY ZERO DOLLARS TAX. HOW MANY OF YOU PAY ZERO TAX? BILLIONAIRES ARE PAYING A TAX-FREE AS INVESTMENT MONEY, A LOWER TAX RATES THEN IF YOU HAVE A JOB AS A PLUMBER. HOW CAN THAT BE? THE MONEY THAT I AM GOING TO RAISE IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE AND GROW THE CLASS BACK , GROW THE MIDDLE CLASS BACK. TO GET IT BACK TO FULL EMPLOYMENT FAST AND HELPLESS BUILD BACK BETTER THAN BEFORE. WE ARE GOING TO CREATED MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. THE PRESIDENT TURNS TO ME, IN THAT STATE OF UNION ADDRESSES, AND HE SAID THAT SHERIFF JOE IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF AND HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. WE GO BACK THE LONGEST EXPANSION IN AMERICAN HISTORY. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY, MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A FUTURE MADE IN AMERICA. UPGRADING THE WATER AND PIPES, MAKING SURE THAT IT IS SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT. BILL AND LAY DOWN BY UNION PLUMBERS AND PIPE FEEDERS HERE. WE ARE GOING TO UPGRADE 4 MILLION BUILDINGS WITH WEATHERIZATION OF 2 MILLION HOMES. THIS WILL. ONE MILLION GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. LOOK FOLKS, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BILL BACK BETTER , BUILD BACK BETTER. HE PROMISES INTRA-FRACTURE PLANTS. HE DID NOT DO ANYTHING. HE PROMISED TO RELIEVE MAIN STREET SLAMMED BY THE RECESSION. GUESS WHERE THAT MONEY WENT THAT THE CONGRESS PASSED? A WENT TO THE WEALTHY. , IT WENT TO THE WEALTHY, AND IT DID NOT GO TO SMALL BUSINESSES. MY PLAN TO REVITALIZE INFRASTRUCTURE IS TO BUY IN AMERICA. WE ARE GOING TO RAISE OVER $3.7 TRILLION BY ELIMINATING THE TAX CUT FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. WE WILL FIX WATER PIPELINES AND UPGRADE LED PLANTS. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD $100 BILLION FOR OUR SCHOOLS. 4 MILLION BUILDINGS. ADVANCED HEATING AND COOLING SYSTEM. THERE WILL BE A RACE FOR JOB CREATION FOR UNIONS, YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE IT. WHAT I DID THE RECOVERY ACT, $800 BILLION. NOT ONE SINGLE SOLITARY DOLLAR WENT TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PREVAILING WAGE. I AM ALSO GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT CORPORATE AMERICA WANTED TO TAKE CARE , TAKEOVER RESIDENCY A PURCHASE SHIPS , APPRENTICESHIPS. I'M GOING TO PASS THE PROACTIVE , PO-ACT. STRENGTHEN LABOR STANDARDS, THE OSHA RULES. THERE IS A LOT THAT WE CAN DO, BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO. WORKERS. HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET BENEFITED. MY DAD HAD ANOTHER EXPRESSION. AFTER HE LOST HIS JOB, AND WE MOVED TO DELAWARE. HE SAID JOEY, A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR GET IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. EVERY TIME THAT WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, DONALD TRUMP SAYS HOAX. I THINK JOBS. NO MATTER HOW MANY LIES HE TELLS, I'M NOT BANNING FRACKING. PERIOD. I SAID INSIDE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE OF POWER'S WITH POWER. THE ONLY POWER THAT WE HAVE IS UNION POWER. YOU ARE THE GUYS THEY KEEP THE BARBARIANS ON THE OTHER CITED AT THE GATE FROM TAKING EVERYTHING. THAT IS A FACT. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE MIDDLE-CLASS PERSON FEARING THE MOST? THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO TEAR DOWN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON IT. WE WILL HAVE A NOT-FOR-PROFIT PUBLIC INSURANCE OPTION. WE WILL INCREASE SUBSIDIES, AND PREMIUMS WILL BE LOWER. WE WILL HAVE PLANS WITH LOWER DEDUCTIBLES AND LOWER OUT OF COSTS EXPENSES. WE WOULD DO THAT WITH THE MONEY THAT WE TAKE BACK FROM THE SUPER WEALTHY. WE WILL TAKE ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, WITH PLANS THAT WILL , WE WILL WORK WITH STATES TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO FREE, HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL. NOT DAYCARE, BUT PRESCHOOL. THE MATTER WHAT THE BACKGROUND, IF YOU START THEM AT AGE THREE, THEY HAVE A 50% CHANCE OF GRADUATING THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND BEYOND, NO MATTER THE BACKGROUND. TALK TO THE WOMEN AROUND HERE. I WAS A SINGLE DAD FOR FIVE YEARS. I COULD NOT AFFORD HELP. THANK GOD THAT HAD MY SISTER AND MOM AND BROTHER TO HELP WITH MY KIDS, WHEN MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KILLED. WHEN ERIE GETS ITS FIRST COMMUNITY COLLEGE OPENED, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS FREE FOR ANYONE WHO QUALIFIES TO GET IN. THAT IS A FACT. THAT COST $6 BILLION A YEAR. THAT IS ABOUT AS MUCH AS WE GIVE AS A TAX REDUCTION FOR RACEHORSES. LOOK AT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF SCHOOL SINCE THE 9/11 GENERATION. THEY GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE, NO GRADUATIONS. THEY ALL GOT SHUT DOWN IN THE GREAT RECESSION AND NOW. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? THEY ARE UNABLE TO MAKE THAT FIRST HOME DOWN PAYMENT. A LOT OF THEM ARE COLLEGE GRADUATES, AND THERE IS NO JOBS, NO ACCESS. I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WILL GET A TAX CREDIT FOR YOUR FIRST TIME HOME BUYING, PROVIDING A DOWN PAYMENT. WE WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND INCREASE BENEFITS FOR MANY OF SENIORS, SO YOU CAN RETIRE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. WE WILL HAVE TO VOTE, LIKE WE HAVE NEVER VOTED BEFORE. EARLY VOTING IS OPEN HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. GO TO EARLY VOTING IF YOU CAN. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM/PA TO FIND OUT WHERE YOU CAN VOTE AND WAKE ABOUT EARLY. MAKE SURE THAT YOU SEAL THE MAIL-IN BALLOT AND A SECRECY ENVELOPE AND SIGNED THE DECLARATION ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE ENVELOPE BEFORE YOU RETURN IT. I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT I AM GOING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I'M GOING TO WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. I AM SO PROUD IN THIS CAMPAIGN TO EARN THE SUPPORT OF SONY PROUD, PATRIOTIC REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING THE HOMELAND SECURITY TOM RIDGE. WE AGREE ON THIS. THIS IS A MOMENT FOR COUNTRY ABOVE PARTY. AFTER ALL THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH, AND AFTER ALL THAT AMERICA HAS ACCOMPLISHED, IT CANNOT BE THAT HERE, IN THE YEAR 2020, THAT WE WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE, TO PARISH ON THIS EARTH, AS LINCOLN SAID. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALL OF THIS DIVISION BEING PUSHED BY THIS PRESIDENT. ALL OF THIS ENCOURAGED. IN THE DEBATE THAT WE HAD, I ASKED HIM TO CONDEMN THE PROUD BOYS? HE SAID TO STAND DOWN AND STAND READY. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY, FOR REAL. WE CAN ARGUE LIKE HELL, THAT THE END OF THE DAY, WE COME TOGETHER. I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES THAN I'VE EVER BEEN. WHY? THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF. I THINK THAT WE CAN PULL THIS TOGETHER. I AM OPTIMISTIC. I'D GENUINELY AM. YET TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GO OUT AND VOTE. THE ONLY WAY THAT WE LOSE THIS IS BY WHAT IS GOING ON RELATIVE TO THE POLLING PLACES. NOT EIGHT SINGLE SOLITARY REASONABLE PERSON SAID THAT MAIL-IN BALLOTS ARE CORRECT. HE IS TRYING TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE THAT. TRY TO PUT PEOPLE IN POLLING PLACES, THE SAME GUYS THAT YOU SAW BLOCKING PEOPLE'S WAY IN VIRGINIA WITH BANNERS AND RACIAL SLUR ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. SO I SAY TO YOU ALL, GOD BLESS YOU ALL. LET'S GO OUT AND VOTE, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. WHERE MY GOING? AM I GOING THIS WAY? THANKS EVERYBODY. THANKS A MILLION. THANK YOU!",

         "THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS THEY SAY, AND PART OF MY CITY, YOUR FAMILY DONE GOOD. A LONG TIME. GOD LOVE YOU. GIVE YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. TODAY, UNFORTUNATELY, AMERICA IS GOING TO HAVE TO SPEAK TO THIS QUICKLY, TRYING TO REACH A TRAGIC MILESTONE. 200,000 DEATHS RECORDED, AS OF TODAY BECAUSE OF CORONAVIRUS. 200,000 DEATHS ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. EMPTY CHAIRS AND UNDOING TABLES, KITCHEN TABLES THAT WEEKS AND MONTHS AGO WERE FILLED WITH A LOVED ONE, A MOM, DAD, BROTHER OR SISTER. IN MANY CASES, THE PAIN WAS MADE A LOT WORSE. I HAD PEOPLE TELL ME THIS WITH CLOSE FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY TELLING ME BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO VISIT THEIR ELDERLY PARENT OR GRANDPARENT IN THE NURSING HOME BEFORE THEY PASSED AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY STORIES I HEARD FROM THE NURSES, SAYING THEY HELD UP THE CELL PHONE TO THE PATIENT ON THE VENTILATOR, IN THE BED. THAT IS ALL THEY CAN SPEAK TO. THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WERE NOT ABLE TO HOLD FUNERAL SERVICES WHERE THEY COULD PRAY TOGETHER AND REMEMBER THE LOVED ONES THAT THEY LOST. SO MANY OF THE RITUALS HAVE COME TO HELP US COPE WITH PAIN AND LOSS, TO HELP US HONOR THE LIVES OF THOSE WE LOVED. THEY ARE JUST NOT AVAILABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC. WHAT WORRIES ME NOW IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH THIS PANDEMIC FOR SO LONG, THAT I WORRY THAT WE RISK BECOME NUMB TO THE TOLL THAT IS TAKEN ON US AND OUR COUNTRY, AND COMMUNITIES LIKE THIS. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. WE CANNOT LOSE THE ABILITY TO FEEL THE SORROW, LOSS AND ANGER FOR SO MANY LIVES LOST. WE CANNOT LET THE NUMBERS BECOME STATISTICS AND BACKGROUND NOISE, JUST A BLUR IN THE NIGHTLY NEWS. THEY ARE NO LONGER WITH US. SO MANY OF THEM DID NOT HAVE TO LOSE THEIR LIVES TO THIS VIRUS. IF ONLY THE PRESIDENT HAD ACTED SOONER. BACK IN MAY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY RELEASED A STUDY SAYING IF WE HAD ACTED ON MONTH SOONER, WE WOULD HAVE SAVED 70 LIVES. THE LEADING MODEL BEING USED TO TRACK THE VIRUS, THAT MODEL SAYS BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THIS YEAR, WHILE WE ARE WAITING FOR A VACCINE, BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR, WE WILL LOSE UP TO 200,000 ADDITIONAL LIVES. IT POINTS OUT THAT IF WE ACT BY DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE IN WISCONSIN, WEARING A MASK AND MAKING MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD SAVE OVER 115,000 OF THOSE LIVES. I HOPE TO GOD WE WILL NOT HAVE TO LEARN THE SAME BAD LESSON WE LEARNED THE FIRST NINE MONTHS. WE HAVE SEEN ONE OF THE GREATEST LOSSES OF AMERICAN LIFE IN HISTORY. SADLY, IT IS NOT OVER. AS AWFUL AS THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN, IT COULD BE WORSE. WE COULD BE LOOKING AT 178,000 LIVES LOST. ALL THE PRESIDENT DOES IS DELIBERATELY CHANGE THE SUBJECT. IT IS INFURIATING. WE COULD SAVE LIVES, IF WE JUST TAKE SIMPLE STEPS. STILL, THE PRESIDENT REFUSES. WE WATCHED TIM HOLDEN INDOOR RALLY WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT KNEW OF THESE DANGERS BACK IN FEBRUARY. HE HID IT FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE UNDERSTOOD HOW BAD IT WAS. THIS IS A DEADLY VIRUS, FAR MORE DEADLY THAN ANY FLU, BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT HE WAS SAYING TO US PUBLICLY. PUBLICLY, HE TOLD US IT WAS JUST LIKE THE FLU AND THAT IT WOULD DISAPPEAR IN THE WARM WEATHER. IT WAS ALL A LIE. HE KNEW IT. WHAT WAS HIS EXPLANATION? HE SAID HE DID NOT WANT TO SEE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PANIC. TRUMP PANICKED. THE VIRUS WAS TOO BIG FOR HIM. WITH THIS CRISIS, A REAL CRISIS THAT REQUIRED SERIOUS PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP, HE WAS NOT UP TO IT. HE FROZE. HE FAILED TO ACT. AMERICA HAS PAID THE WORST PRICE OF ANY NATION IN THE WORLD. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING. WE DO NOT PANIC. UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS SAYING BECAUSE IT CRYSTALLIZES HIS WHOLE WORLDVIEW. WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAID HE DID NOT WANT TO CREATE A PANIC, HE WAS NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT A HEALTH PANIC. HE WAS WORRIED THAT IF HE TOLD THE PUBLIC THE TRUTH, THERE WOULD BE A PANIC OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, WHICH WOULD HURT HIS CHANCES OF BEING REELECTED. HE SEES THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. I SEE IT FROM WHERE I GREW UP IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. HARD WORK. YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE, ALL YOU CAN SEE IS WALL STREET. YOU THINK WALL STREET BUILT THIS COUNTRY? YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP THANKS THAT HANDING OUT A TAX GIVEAWAY, PRIMARILY FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS AND WEALTHY QUALIFIERS IS AN ECONOMIC PLAN? YOU THINK LIKE TRUMP THAT $15 IS TOO MUCH FOR AMERICA'S ESSENTIAL WORKERS? ELIMINATED OVERTIME PAY FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICAN WORKERS. TRIED TO TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE FROM 20 MILLION AMERICANS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC. TRY TO TAKE AWAY PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR 130 BILLION AMERICANS. PROPOSED A PLAN, IN ORDER TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD, YOU WILL GET A LITTLE BUMP IN YOUR PAY, BUT WE WILL NOT TAKE OUT WITHHOLDING FOR YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, BUT GUESS WHAT? SOCIAL SECURITY SAYS IF HE DOES THAT, SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE BANKRUPT BY THE MIDDLE OF 2023. YOU MIGHT GET THAT OUT OF YOUR PAYCHECK, A LITTLE MORE IN YOUR PAYCHECK, BUT GUESS WHAT? TELL YOUR MOM AND DAD, SAY GOODBYE TO SOCIAL SECURITY. THEY WILL HAVE TO WORK FOR THEIR WHOLE LIVES. THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT WE GOT OUT OF IT, A LOT OF DAIRY FARMERS AND MANUFACTURING WENT UNDER, BUT GUESS WHAT? STARTING A TRADE WAR THAT A SURGE IN BANKRUPTCY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? I DID NOT KNOW THIS AT FIRST. AMERICA'S BANK GOT TO OPEN UP IN BEIJING. THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO BEFORE. LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. HE HAD A DEAL, BUT HE WANTED THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, BEFORE THEY LOWERED THE PRICES, TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS UNETHICAL. HE ASKED THEM TO SEND OUT $100 CHECKS WITH HIS NAME ON IT TO THE ELDERLY. SAYING THAT IS THE DOWN PAYMENT. THEY SAID, GOOGLE NOT DO THAT. THE DEAL FELL APART. NOW, SOME 30 MILLION PEOPLE ARE ON UNEMPLOYMENT. HERE IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THE TAX RATE ALL OF YOU PAY IS GOING TO BE HIGHER THAN BILLIONAIRES WHO MAKE THEIR MONEY ON INVESTMENTS. HE WANTS TO LOWER AGAIN, LOWER THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX. SOMEONE WHO MAKES THEIR MONEY OFF THE MARKET IS PAYING THE 50% RATE. IT DEPENDS ON THE TAX BRACKET. CLEWISTON PERCENT. THIS TAX CUT WILL COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. WHO IS HYDE DOES IT COME OUT OF? DONALD TRUMP RAN FOR OFFICE SAYING HE WOULD REPRESENT THE FORGOTTEN MAN AND WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY. NOT ONLY DID HE FORGET THEM, THE TRUTH IS THAT HE NEVER REALLY RESPECTED US VERY MUCH. HE LOVES HIS RALLIES. THE NEXT TIME HE HOLDS ONE, LOOK CLOSELY. HE KEEPS HIS DISTANCE FROM ANYONE IN THE RALLY. THOSE WHO COME ARE TIGHT AS CAN BE, RISKING DISEASE, BUT NOT TRUMP. HE KEEPS HIS DISTANCE. A REPORTER TRIED TO COME UP AND HE SAID NO, YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. I DO NOT GET CLOSE TO THESE PEOPLE. EVERYBODY IN THE CROWD RISKS THEIR LIVES, BUT NOT HIM. NOW WE KNOW WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT PEOPLE IN HIS RALLIES. A FORMER EMPLOYEE SAID HE CALLS HIS EMPLOYEES DISGUSTING. SHE DOES NOT HAVE TO SHAKE THEIR HANDS. THAT IS THE GOOD THING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC. THESE ARE ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT AND NOT RESPECT. DO NOT KID YOURSELF. THIS IS A ONE-WAY STREET. NOTHING IS MORE OFFENSIVE THAN THE WAY HE SPOKE ABOUT MANY OF YOU BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED YOUR NATION IN UNIFORM. IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY EVERY OUTLET THAT HE REFERRED TO THEM AS LOSERS AND SUCKERS. THAT IS WHAT TRUMP CALLED THE PEOPLE WHO SERVED AND MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. MY SON SERVED AS A VOLUNTEER TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. HE COME , CAME HOME DECORATED AND DIED OF CANCER. HE WAS NOT A LOSER. HE WAS NOT A SUCKER. HE WAS A PATRIOT. ALL THOSE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE SERVED VOLUNTEERED. JUST LIKE YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS. I HAVE DEALT WITH PEOPLE LIKE TRUMP MY WHOLE LIFE. HE LOOKED DOWN ON US BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. GUYS WHO THINK THEY ARE BETTER THAN YOU, GUYS WHO INHERIT EVERYTHING THEY HAVE EVER GOTTEN IN THEIR LIFE AND SQUANDERED IT. GUYS WHO STIFF ELECTRICIANS AND CONTRACTORS JUST TO PUT A FEW MORE BUCKS IN THEIR POCKET. THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO AVOID PAYING THEIR TAXES BECAUSE THEY FIGURE THE REST OF US, THE LITTLE PEOPLE CAN PICK UP THE TAB FOR THE COUNTRY. DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT THE REASON WE HAVE NOT SEEN TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS IS BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT US TO KNOW WHAT HE PAID? HE HAD TO SUMMON THEM OVER. THEY SHOW THAT HE PAID ZERO. HE PAID ZERO, NOTHING. THAT IS A FACT. AND HE WAS ASKED ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? THIS IS WHY I REALLY DO NOT LIKE GUYS LIKE THIS. HE SAID, IT MAKES ME SMART. PUT ANOTHER WAY, I AM NOT A SUCKER. WHY SHOULD I PAY? ZERO. WALL STREET IS A LONG WAY FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. YOU GET TO SEE THE WORLD A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY THERE. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY. HARD-WORKING PEOPLE BUILT THIS COUNTRY. UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. UNION LABOR, LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. I LEARNED A FEW SIMPLE LESSONS FROM MY PARENTS THAT I NEVER FORGOT. ONE IS FROM MY MOTHER. GENERALLY, REMEMBER, NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU, BUT EVERYONE IS YOUR THE , EQUAL. IT IS PRETTY SIMPLE. WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND WE SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. I GOT MY BACK UP RECENTLY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I SAW ON NATIONAL TELEVISION ABOUT THE RACE. I DO NOT BUY IT. JOE BIDEN WILL BE ONLY THE FIRST PRESIDENT WHO DID NOT GO TO AN IV LEAGUE SCHOOL , IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL IN A LONG TIME. SOMEHOW, IT MEANT THAT I COULD NOT BELONG. HOW COULD A GUY WHO WENT TO A STATE SCHOOL BE PRESIDENT? I HAVE TO ADMIT, I SAID IT. I AM NOT PROUD OF IT. HE CLOSED THE DOOR ON ME. YOU THINK I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH? I AM GOING TO BUST DOWN THAT DOOR. A LOT OF YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY BECAUSE OF OUR STANDING. I SAY, IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT A STATE SCHOOL PRESIDENT SAT IN THE OVAL OFFICE. IF I AM SITTING THERE, YOU WILL BE SITTING THERE TOO. ANOTHER LESSON, I LEARNED FROM MY DAD. MY DAD LOST A JOB UP WE HAD TO MOVE WE HAD TO GO TO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW AND A, CAN JEAN AND THE KIDS STAY WITH YOU FOR ABOUT A YEAR? I WILL MAKE IT UP TO YOU. I HAVE A JOB IN DELAWARE. I WILL COME HOME EVERY WEEKEND. TALK ABOUT PRIDE. HE USED TO SAY, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY, BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, IT IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. THE DIGNITY OF WORK. WHAT YOU DO MATTERS. YOU MATTER. I DO NOT WANT TO PUNISH ANYBODY. IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT WE START TO REWARD WORK. NOBODY MAKING LESS THAN FORTON THOUSAND DOLLARS , $400,000 IN THIS COUNTRY WILL SEE THEIR TAXES GO UP. IF YOU MAKE MORE, YOU WILL START TO PAY MORE. I AM NOT LOOKING TO PUNISH ANYONE. SOME OF THE WEALTHIEST CORPORATIONS NEED TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. MANY OF THEM ARE PAYING ZERO. THEY TAKE NO TAX AT ALL. HOW CAN THAT BE FAIR? THE PRESIDENT TALKS ALL THE TIME ABOUT HOW GREAT THE ECONOMY IS. THE BILLIONAIRES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE SEEING THEIR WEALTH INCREASE BY $800 BILLION. ALL THE BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA, DURING THE PANDEMIC, THEIR NET WORTH, COMBINED HAVE INCREASED BY $800 BILLION. THE REST OF US? 30 MILLION PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED. 20 MILLION AMERICANS ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOME. SEVEN PLUS MILLION AMERICANS ARE WORKING PART-TIME, WHO WANT TO WORK FULL-TIME. EVICTIONS ARE ON THE RISE. FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES, THE KIDS ARE AT HOME AND NOT AT SCHOOL. IT IS THE WORKING PEOPLE WHO KNEW HE'D , WHO NEED A TAX BREAK. YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT. I SAID IT MANY TIMES. NEED TO I'VE SAID IT MANY TIMES DURING THIS PANDEMIC, WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN JUST PRAISE OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS, WE NEED TO PAY THEM. WE NEED TO MAKE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERY AMERICAN. MY PLAN WILL LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BY 60%. IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS OBAMA AND I PUT IN PLACE AND MAKE IT A LOT MORE AFFORDABLE TO HAVE THAT HEALTH CARE. WE NEED TO EMPOWER LABOR UNIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT DIDN'T SAY IN THE 1930'S, YOU CAN'T HAVE LABOR UNIONS. IT SAID WE SHOULD PROMOTE LABOR UNIONS. THAT'S WHAT IT SAID, AND I WILL. ONE MORE THING. UNDER MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN, WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE WITH UNION WORKERS AND PREVAILING WAGE, WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. WE'RE GOING TO REBUILD MANUFACTURING IN THIS COUNTRY. WE'LL DO IT BY ENFORCING A REAL BUY AMERICAN PLAN. LOOK, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT $600 BILLION A YEAR IN PURCHASING POWER THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS EVERY YEAR FROM TAX DOLLARS AND DETERMINES HOW IT'S USED. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GOD WILLING, AMERICAN COMPANIES WITH AMERICAN WORKERS BUILDING AMERICAN PRODUCTS USING AMERICAN SUPPLY CHAINS ARE GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONES WHO GET THE CONTRACTS. THAT MEANS AMERICAN ALUMINUM FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, FOR DEVELOPING MORE WIND AND SOLAR AND HYDROELECTRIC POWER. ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL REPLACE CARS IN THE FEDERAL FLEET. WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST FLEETS IN THE WORLD, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT THEM ALL TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. GUESS WHAT? THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING MUCH MORE LIGHTER FRAMES, MORE ALUMINUM FOR AUTOMOBILES THAT ALREADY IF THEY ARE ALUMINUM BUILT, THEY CAN REDUCE BY 15%, EVEN WITH A COMBUSTION ENGINE. 1.5 MILLION NEW AFFORDABLE HOMES AND HOUSING. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD. THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF WORK, INCREASED WORK AT HOME. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TRANSFER 40 MILLION BUILDINGS AROUND AMERICA TO MAKE THEM WEATHER RESISTANT SO THEY ARE CHANGE THE WINDOWS, DOORS, WALLS, THE WHOLE RANGE. BUILDING BACK BETTER MEANS FIRING UP OUR SHUTTERED FOUNDRIES AND MOVING FORWARD TO BUSINESS THAT IS TRULY MADE IN AMERICA. I WANT TO SPEND A FEW MOMENTS TALKING TO THOSE WHO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP LAST TIME. WHEN I WAS OUT HERE IN OUR ADMINISTRATION, YOU VOTED FOR US. THEN AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTY CHANGED, AND THEY VOTED FOR TRUMP LAST TIME. I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE FRUSTRATED, ANGRY, BELIEVED YOU WEREN'T BEING SEEN, REPRESENTED OR HEARD. I GET IT. IT HAS TO CHANGE. I PROMISE YOU THIS, IT WILL CHANGE WITH ME. YOU WILL BE SEEN, HEARD, AND RESPECTED BY ME. THIS CAMPAIGN ISN'T JUST ABOUT WINNING VOTES, IT'S ABOUT RESTORING THE BASIC DIGNITY IN THIS COUNTRY THAT EVERY WORKER DESERVES. BASIC DIGNITY WE ALL HAVE WITHOUT WINNING BACK HEARTS AND SOUL OF AMERICA, WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN I WAS ASKED ABOUT THE DEATH COUNT APPROACHING 200,000, THE PRESIDENT SAID, AND I QUOTE, HE SAID , I WON'T QUOTE HIM. THE PRESIDENT SAID, IF YOU TAKE OUT THE BLUE STATES RUN BY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS AND JUST LOOK AT THE RED STATES, REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ARE DOING QUITE WELL. NOW, OF COURSE, IT'S A SIMPLE FACTUAL MATTER, IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. IF YOU COUNT ALL THE DEATHS IN THE RED STATES, WE ARE NUMBER TWO IN THE WORLD IN DEATHS JUST BEHIND BRAZIL. BUT MORE FUNDAMENTALLY, IT REFLECTS ON THE PART OF DONALD TRUMP THAT HE HAS A DEEPLY FLAWED AND DIVISIVE VIEW OF THE UNITED STATES. THIS NATION AND THE JOB HE HOLDS. THINK ABOUT WHAT HE'S SAYING. IF YOU LIVE IN A STATE LIKE WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, STATES WITH DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS, YOU'RE NOT HIS PROBLEM. HE HAS NO OBLIGATION TO YOU. HE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU AS PRESIDENT, YOUR FAMILY OR WELL-BEING. I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY. I DON'T PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO RED STATES OR BLUE STATES OF AMERICA, I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ONE NATION UNDER GOD FOR REAL. I'M RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT. I'M NOT GOING TO GOVERN AS A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, I'M GOING TO GOVERNOR AS PRESIDENT. I GET CRITICIZED FOR SAYING THAT SOMETIMES TO SOME IN MY PARTY, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I'M GOING TO FIGHT AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORTED ME AS THOSE WHO DID NOT SUPPORT ME. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT, FOR GOD'S SAKE, THIS HAS TO BE AN AMERICAN MOMENT. IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO PUT ANGER AND DIVISION AND THE DARKNESS THAT'S OVERTAKEN THIS COUNTRY BEHIND US. WE HAVE TO PUT IT BEHIND US. I KNOW I'VE BEEN CRITICIZED SINCE I ENTERED PRIMARIES ABOUT UNITING THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. WE CAN. WE'VE DONE IT SO MANY TIMES IN OUR HISTORY. WE'VE BEGUN ANEW. IF WE GET CONTROL OF THIS VIRUS, WE CAN. WE CAN REWARD WORK. WE CAN FIX THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE CAN BE A SAFE AND JUST NATION. WE CAN DEAL WITH THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WHICH ALUMINUM IS GOING TO BE A GIGANTIC PART OF. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST, ONE NATION. ONE NATION. ONE PEOPLE. ONE AMERICA. WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO IN GOD'S NAME WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN OUR LONG HISTORY, THERE'S BEEN NOTHING WE'VE BEEN UNABLE TO DO , NOTHING WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OVERCOME WHEN WE'VE DONE IT TOGETHER. I'M CONFIDENT GOING ALL OVER THIS NATION, WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY. WE HAVE TO BRING THE NATION TOGETHER. THAT'S GOING TO BE MY PRIMARY JOB. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. GOD BLESS YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. Y'ALL STAY SAFE AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU, MA'AM. APPRECIATE IT.",

I GO BACK A LONG WAY WITH A LOT OF FOLKS WHO REPRESENTED THIS STATE, AND SOME OF YOU HEARD ME SAY IT BEFORE, IT REMINDS ME OF MY HOME STATE OF DELAWARE IN ONE IMPORTANT RESPECT EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. MATTER OF FACT, FIRST TIME I RAN FOR THE UNITED DATES SENATE, I WAS 29 YEARS OLD DOES UNITED STATES SENATE, I WAS 29 YEARS OLD, NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. I BETTER BE CAREFUL. BEEN A GREAT FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. BUT WHEN IRAN, MY STATE WAS A LITTLE LIKE YOURS I RAN, MY STATE WAS A LITTLE LIKE YOURS. I REMEMBER, I STARTED OFF MY CAMPAIGN IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. THEY SPEAK WITH A THICK ACCENT, FOR REAL. WE WERE A BORDER STATE, NOT SURE WHAT SIDE WE WANT TO FIGHT ON IN THOSE DAYS, FOR REAL. THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS VERY SOUTHERN. THEY TALK AT YOU LIKE YOU ARE A GOOD OLD FELLA. THE WAY YOU GO IN DELAWARE, YOU WORK YOUR WAY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. THEY SAID, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY, BECAUSE EVERYONE IS RELATED DOWN HERE. EDGAR C BENNETT YOU COULD NOT CALL HIM ED, IT WAS EDGAR C. IF YOU ARE NOT INVITED TO STAY IN SOMEONE'S HOME IN DELAWARE AND HAVE TO GO TO A HOTEL, YOU KNOW YOU ARE NOT REALLY THAT WELCOME. EDGAR C. SEEMED A LOT MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN I WAS, BUT WERE HAPPY TO HAVE ME TO GO. SO WE WENT TO MASS AND THEN HE WANTED ME TO GO TO HIS CHURCH IN DOWNTOWN SELBY VILLE. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH, METHODIST CHURCH, AND HAD THE GRAVEYARD IN THE FRONT LIKE THE OLD CATHOLIC CHURCH I BELONG TO IN UPSTATE DELAWARE, ST. JOSEPH'S. YOU WALK THROUGH THE HEADSTONES AND THE ENTRANCE TO GO UP. THE MINISTER WAS VERY KIND TO ME WHEN I SHOWED UP AT THE CHURCH WITH HIM. HE SAID, WE HAVE WITH US JOE BIDEN, RUNNING FOR THE UNITED EIGHTH SENATE UNITED STATES SENATE. HOPEFULLY HE WILL GREET THE PARISHIONERS AS THEY WALK OUT. I DID NOT EXPECT THAT, BUT I WAS VERY FLATTERED. SO I STOOD THERE WITH THE MINISTER SHAKING HANDS WITH EVERYBODY. EDGAR SEAT WAS STANDING UNDER THESE BIG OAK TREES THAT TOOK UP THE WHOLE CHURCH AREA. AFTER THE WORDS AFTERWARDS, I WALKED UP AND SAID, IT WENT OK. EXCEPT FOR THAT HORSE'S TAIL OVER THERE. HE SAID OF, THAT IS MY FIRST COUSIN, EDGAR. TRUE STORY. I WANT TO GET YOUR QUESTIONS, SO I WILL BE RELATIVELY BRIEF. NUMBER ONE, THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW, BUT THE SINGLE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ISSUE YOU ON THOUGH, MR. MAYOR, IF WE GET FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP, IT IS GOING TO CHANGE WHO WE ARE AS THE CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE, I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE. IT MATTERS A LOT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO AND WHO WE ARE GOING TO PICK. WHEN I ANNOUNCED FOR THE SENATE, I DID THE SAME THING WHEN I ANNOUNCED FOR PRESIDENT, STATE MERELY WHY I WAS RUNNING WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT. THERE'S THREE REASONS. ONE, TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE I THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED, ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WITH THOSE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE WOODS, SCREECHING, THEIR VEINS BULGING, A YOUNG WOMAN GOT KILLED AND THEY ASKED THE PRESIDENT WHAT THEY THOUGHT, AND HE SAID THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO PRESIDENT HAS NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT, FOR REAL. MAYBE ANDREW JACKSON SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR, BUT NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I AM RUNNING, TO RESTORE A SENSE OF DECENCY AND HONOR. WE HOLD THOSE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THEM BEFORE. THE PRESIDENT HAS THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS WALKED AWAY FROM THEM, BECAUSE EVERY TIME, EVERY GENERATION HAS MOVED THE ARK OF CONCLUSION OF INCLUSION WIDER AND WIDER AND WIDER, AND IT IS BEING SHUTDOWN. I THINK IT IS BEING CORROSIVE FOR THE COUNTRY. THE SECOND REASON I SAID I WAS RUNNING, TO RESTORE THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS TAKEN A BEATING. WE USED TO BE THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD. ALL THE DATA SHOWS THAT 60% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING MAY HAVE HAD. WE HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THAT WAY BEFORE IN THE LAST CENTURY. WE HAVE NEVER LOST THAT SENSE OF OPTIMISM BEFORE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED. THIS TIME WHEN WE REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, WE HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. EVERYBODY ALONG. FROM THE DISABLED TO PEOPLE OF CALLER, AS WELL AS HARD-WORKING PEOPLE MY DAD WOULD SAY I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, I WANT THEM TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEM, THE GOVERNMENT. JUST GIVE ME A SHOT. THE THIRD REASON I WAS RUNNING IS BECAUSE WE HAD TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. I WAS PRETTY ROUNDLY CRITICIZED BY A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES, ALL 900 RUNNING FROM THE PRIMARY NO, THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE. THEY REALLY ARE. THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY WOULD SAY YEAH, JOE BIDEN USED TO BE ABLE TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER BEFORE, REMEMBER? HEATED THE ARMS CONTROL TREATIES, HE DID AND THEY WOULD GO THROUGH ALL THE THINGS I HAVE DONE, BUT THAT WAS THE OLD DAYS. THIS REPUBLICAN PARTY IS DIFFERENT. IT IS DIFFERENT, BUT IT WAS ONLY THREE YEARS AGO THAT WE DID A LOT OF THESE THINGS. I THINK UNIFYING THE COUNTRY IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. I DO NOT THINK IT IS NAIVE I UNDERSTAND THIS NEW REPUBLIC AND PARTY WELL. I HAVE BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END OF DONALD TRUMP'S BILLION DOLLARS OF ADS TRYING TO THIS MERGE MY ONLY SURVIVING SON, GOING AFTER MY FAMILY, GOING AFTER ME I UNDERSTAND THEM. I UNDERSTAND THEM WELL. BUT IT IS NOT ABOUT ME, IT IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM AND AROUND THE COUNTRY. PRESIDENTS SHOULD NOT HOLD GRUDGES. THEY SHOULD BE ELECTED TO RUN AND REPRESENT ALL THE PEOPLE. ALL THE PEOPLE. IMMIGRANTS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS, BECAUSE DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS, BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T COME TOGETHER WE CAN DO ANYTHING. THIS COUNTRY IS DESIGNED TO REQUIRE CONSENSUS. WITHOUT IT, THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN GET DONE OTHER THAN THE ABUSE OF POWER BY A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS, I CAN'T GET IT DONE THOUGH I AM JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT. I DO NOT THINK IT IS NAIVE AT ALL TO TALK ABOUT UNITING THE COUNTRY. AND THE NEED TO DO IT. I BELIEVE WE CAN, BECAUSE I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION SOME OF THE PEOPLE I AM RUNNING WITH IN THIS NOMINATION SAY TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE WILL BE FOREVER AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER. IT CANNOT BE SUSTAINED IN AMERICA. IT CANNOT BE SUSTAINED. IT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. SO WE HAVE TO. WE CANNOT SURRENDER THE NOTION. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. BUT I HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF HARD THINGS DONE BEFORE. DOES NOT MEAN IT IS NOT GOING TO BE HARD THIS TIME. HERE IS THE DEAL. YOU CAN GET REPUBLICAN SOMETIMES IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE TO VOTE WITH YOU, AND WHEN YOU DON'T, YOU GO OUT AND BEAT THEM. AND I DO NOT MEAN BY GOING AFTER THEIR PERSONALITIES OR THE DIRTY POLITICS OF GOING AFTER THEIR MOTIVES. LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN AMERICAN POLITICS. EVEN SMALL STATES THAT ARE CLOSE LIKE YOURS AND MINE. WHAT HAPPENS? I COME TO YOU AND I SAY, LOOK. I THINK YOU ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG BUSINESS. I THINK YOU ARE IMMORAL. I THINK YOU ARE THIS BY THE WAY, LET'S WORK OUT A DEAL ON HOW WE ARE GOING TO WORKOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. FAT CHANCE. I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO FROM MIKE MANSFIELD, THE MAJORITY LEADER FROM MONTANA, MORE INTEGRITY IN HIS LITTLE FINGER THAN MOST PEOPLE HADN'T HIT THEIR WHOLE BODY HAD IN THEIR WHOLE BODY, FOR REAL. HE SAID IT IS NOT ALWAYS APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION A MAN OR WOMAN'S MOTIVES, BUT IT IS ALWAYS APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION THEIR JUDGMENT. YOU DO NOT KNOW THEIR MOTIVES. QUESTION THEIR JUDGMENT. THEN YOU CAN GET SOMETHING PASSED. WHEN IN FACT A LOT HAS CHANGED WITH THIS PRESIDENT. WHEN THE CARDI SHOW CARNIE SHOW COMES THROUGH TOWN AND YOU FIND OUT THERE ARE NO PEANUTS UNDER THE THREE SHELLS, YOU USUALLY KNOW BETTER THE SECOND TIME. BETTER THE SECOND TIME. BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. WHEN IN FACT SO MUCH HAS CHANGED, I THINK THE ENVIRONMENT IS SO RIGHT FOR US TO DO SO MUCH MORE, NOT AS DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS, BUT AS A NATION. WE CAN ONLY 21ST CENTURY. WE OWN THE 21ST CENTURY. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC IN MY LIFE ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF THIS COUNTRY. FOLKS, LOOK. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE WHEN THE REPUBLICANS DISAGREE WITH US, IF I'M YOUR PRESIDENT, IF THEY DISAGREE WITH US, HERE IS THE DEAL. TAKE IT TO THEM IN THEIR DISTRICTS. CAMPAIGN. FOR EXAMPLE, I WENT TO 24 STATES AND CAMPAIGN FOR 67, 60 9 I AM NOT SURE THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES LAST TIME OUT IN 2018. THE ONLY GUY INVITED IN ALL THE STATES, FROM ALABAMA TO MONTANA TO COLORADO TO PENNSYLVANIA, STATE THAT WE LOST AND/OR WERE CLOSE. GUESS WHAT WE DID? WE DID NOT GO AFTER THE PERSONALITIES OF THE PEOPLE WE RAN AGAINST, WE SAID WE ARE GOING TO WIN 41 FEET AND TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. WE WON 41 SEATS. BY THE WAY, FOUR ACADEMY GRADUATES, ONE THE FIRST MARINE FIGHTER PILOT, DROPPING BOMBS. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE GROUP. WHAT DID WE DO? WE SAID, ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN PEOPLE REALIZED REMEMBER, WE LOST THE HOUSE WHEN WE PASSED OBAMACARE. PEOPLE SAID, YOU LOST BECAUSE IT IS NOT POPULAR. THEN WHAT HAPPENED?THEN ALONG CAME THE REPUBLICANS IN THIS STATE AND OTHERS AND SAID, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE AWAY OBAMACARE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ANYMORE. YOU CANNOT KEEP YOUR CHILD ON YOUR HEALTH-CARE POLICY UNTIL AGE 26 ANYMORE, ETC. EVERYONE SAID WELL, WHAT? BECAUSE PEOPLE DID NOT EVEN KNOW IT WAS OBAMACARE. I SAID TO THE PRESIDENT I KEEP ON PICKING ON JOHN, BUT JOHN KNOWS MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP HERE. YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT. I GOT IN TROUBLE ARE SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE A FIRESIDE CHAT REMEMBER THAT? BUT THE PRESIDENT SAID, WE DON'T HAVE TIME. THERE'S TOO MANY THINGS WE HAVE TO FACE TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP. IT WASN'T UNTIL PEOPLE STARTED TO TAKE IT AWAY THAT PEOPLE STARTED TO REALIZE, WHOA. IF YOU ARE A STATE REPRESENTATIVE, GOVERNOR, YOUR SENATOR, YOUR CONGRESSMAN WANTS TO TAKE AWAY THIS THING YOU HAPPY. YOU HAVE. PEOPLE SAID NO. AND WE WON. WHEN YOU CANNOT CONVINCE, YOU GO OUT AND MAKE THE CASE. PEOPLE KNOW I AM CONCLUDING WITH THIS AND I WILL GO TO QUESTIONS, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, FROM EDUCATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE, TO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT. CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH A WHOLE RANGE OF ISSUES, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, WHICH THEY ARE TRYING TO KILL, A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. EVERYBODY WHO KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS I AM NOT BEING FACETIOUS. THIS IS REALITY. EVEN THE SUPPORTERS KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY KNOW WHO HE IS, PEOPLE LIKE CAM, THEY KNOW WHO HE IS. NONE OF THEM ARE ARGUING THAT THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO GROW UP WITH THE SAME CHARACTER, BUT THEY KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY DECIDED THEY LIKE HIM BECAUSE OF THINGS HE DID OR THINGS DEMOCRATS DID NOT DO OR WHATEVER. WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW THAT WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. BECAUSE HE FEEDS ON FEEDING FEARS PEOPL FEEDING FEAR TO PEOPLE. IF YOU SAY THE LIE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN, IT BREAKS THROUGH. IF YOU SAY IT AND SAY IT AND SAY IT WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. OVER FICTION. FOR REAL. . WE GOT A LOT OF WORK CUT OUT FOR US. I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING EVERYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 15. WE OWE YOU BIG, KIDDO. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT HERE, BUT AFTER THIS IS OVER, COME UP AND TALK TO ME. EVERYBODY UNDER 15, YOU GET SOMETHING SPECIAL TODAY, BECAUSE THIS HAS TO BE BORING, BORING, BORING FOR YOU. THANK YOU. MY MOTHER WOULD OFTEN SAY JOEY, HUSH UP AND TAKE SOME QUESTIONS.",

         "Well, thank you, Special Agent Dawson. It is an honor to be here with you, with so many extraordinary, courageous Americans. To Senator Ted Cruz, thank you for your great leadership and support. Congressman Brady, Congressman Crenshaw, Lieutenant Governor Patrick , but most especially, to all of the courageous men and women of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement: Thank you for your service. We are proud of you and we are with you. (Applause.) And as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine who is a great admirer of the extraordinary men and women of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, who has been a champion of the rule of law and supporter of all of those who enforce our immigration laws , I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The President asked me to be here today among all of you , who he likes to call 'incredible people' , just to, first and foremost, say thank you. Thank you for your service. Thank you for the difference that you make in the life of our nation and the way you advance the safety and security of this community here in Houston, the state of Texas, and the nation as whole. Your leadership, your courageous service makes a difference every single day. It is remarkable to think: Sixteen years in the making, this agency has served the United States with great distinction and great courage. Twenty thousand American patriots like those of you gathered here comprise this organization. And in 2018 alone, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents and officers made more than 34,000 criminal arrests , the most in any single year. And America is safer because of ICE. (Applause.) Together, ICE agents removed 3,600 gang members from our streets, including 900 criminals affiliated with MS-13. You seized nearly 10,000 pounds of opioids before they could make their way to our communities large and small and tear at the very fabric of families and deliver hardship and heartache to families all across this nation. You know, the heartbreak that never happens, the crimes that never happen, never make it in the paper. But I want to assure you that this President, his Vice President, these extraordinary public officials who are here with us today know that, every day, ICE makes Houston and Texas and America safer. And you have our gratitude and our thanks. (Applause.) Now, unfortunately the field offices in Texas are some of the busiest in the country and we understand that. And I want to let you all know that we couldn't be more proud of the efforts that all of you make in a challenging environment. Some 1,200 miles of the southern border here in Texas , and, in the midst of a crisis on our southern border, the challenges are greater than ever. And , but you all have stepped up and done extraordinary work. I want to say we're particularly proud of your colleagues, just this week, in the Dallas office of ICE Homeland Security Investigations , arrested more than 280 people in the largest worksite operation at a single site in the last 10 years, upholding the laws of our land. So our thanks to the Dallas office. (Applause.) But here in Houston, the record is equally remarkable. In 2018, you arrested more than 14,000 illegal aliens, including more than 13,000 with criminal records. Your fugitive operations team focused on cases involving gangmembers, sex offenders, violent criminals; and, in 2018, arrested more than a thousand illegal aliens who posed a serious threat to national security and the safety of our nation. In fact, I'm told, just last week, ERO Houston arrested an illegal alien who's wanted for homicide in the Honduras. And the people of Houston and Texas are safer as a result of even that single apprehension. And not to be outdone, Homeland Security Investigations has already distinguished itself as well here in Houston. I'm told HSI Houston initiated more than 1,200 criminal investigations last year, resulting in the arrest of more than 1,300 human traffickers, drug smugglers, and gang members. So thank you to HIS Houston as well for the extraordinary work that you've done. (Applause.) The stories are too many to tell, but I like to tell a few of them. (Laughter.) We're joined today by a Special Agent, an online undercover agent for HSI. I'm told that he's one of the best. He's working on investigating child exploitation and human trafficking. And we just heard from one of your distinguished members of Congress that Texas, tragically , Texas, tragically, has become , and this city has become a hub of the vile trade of human trafficking and sex trafficking. This Special Agent is routinely called on for expert support by law enforcement agencies all across Texas and all across America. So would you join me in thank Special Agent Heath Hardwick? Where are you, Heath? (Applause.) Thank you for your work. Great job. Heath does more to help lock up criminals who exploit children and vulnerable families each and every day. And we couldn't be more proud, also, of your efforts to educate , to educate students and parents and teachers about how to protect our kids in the digital age. Well done. We're also joined by a deportation officer and program officer. I'm told the person first aspired to become a doctor. Went to medical school in Mexico 40 years ago, but then discovered a passion for wearing the uniform of law enforcement. As one former supervisor said, for more than three decades, he's treated every assignment like it's the most important work. And that's a work ethic that I know drives this office every single day. Join me in thanking Rogelio Gutierrez for an outstanding job protecting our community. Where are you, Rogelio? (Applause.) Great job. We could go on, and, frankly, I know we could name everybody in this room. And it'd be my honor to do it. But just know that, in recognizing these two extraordinary agents, that we're recognizing each and every one of you for the work that you do and the risks that you take each and every day. And the American people and the people of Texas deserve to know that, as you serve selflessly, as you consider our lives more important than your own, the truth of the matter is, this is a very challenging time for people in ICE. Across the country and even here in Texas, the heroes of ICE have been targeted not only by protests but by online harassment. ICE officers and leadership have had their personal information shared and social media. That's led to threats against you and your families. It's truly extraordinary. Now let me be clear: The American people have every right to engage in peaceful protests. But the threats and attempts to intimidate ICE officers and their families must stop, and they must stop right now. (Applause.) The sad fact is that your job is more challenging than ever. That's the reason I'm here in Texas today; it's the reason President Trump is in California today, because we want you to know that we're with you. You saw this President take strong measures, working with these members of Congress, to secure funding to end the crisis of illegal immigration on our southern border. But you all see the headlines as much as any other American does. You all live it here in these offices and in your assignments every day. You don't need me to tell you we've got a crisis of illegal immigration on our southern border and it's different than anything that we've ever seen before. For the first time in the history of this country, the majority of people , some 4,000 in a single day last week , the majority of people coming across our southern border are families and unaccompanied minors who are being enticed to make the long and dangerous journey north by drug cartels and human traffickers who would exploit them and exploit the loopholes in our laws. And now, here, the Houston office and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement is dealing with a wave not only of the people that are coming across the border that we apprehend that make a claim for asylum to try and gain entry into our country to exploit programs in our laws like catch and release that allow people to apply for asylum and then disappear into America that you all know better than me , it's not just the people that we stop at our border. It's the people that we're not stopping as we deal with an avalanche of families and vulnerable children coming across our southern border. You saw the President of the United States take action. We stood strong in the Congress of the United States and President Trump declared a national emergency. And we have secured the funding and have already started to build new wall on the southern border of the United States. (Applause.) The President will be reviewing some of that , those new structures in Calexico today. But you all know , in Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and at HSI, you know it's not just about infrastructure on our border. We also secured resources to support your work , additional personnel and additional bed space. But I must tell you: The President's declaration of a national emergency has made resources available and we're putting them to good use. And I want to take this opportunity specifically to thank Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Cornyn, Congressmen Brady and Crenshaw. Thank you for standing for border security. Thank you for standing with President Donald Trump to end the crisis of illegal immigration. (Applause.) But I am here today to tell you that we've only , we've only begun this fight. We're going to build the wall. We're going to secure our border in new and in renewed ways. We're going to provide you with the resources we need. But you all know that Congress also has to act. The loopholes in our law that are known as catch and release; the loopholes in our law that do not allow us to return unaccompanied minors to their home countries in Central America the way that we can in Mexico; the very nature of the structure of our legal system is being exploited by human traffickers and it's creating suffering on both sides of our border. I mean, make no mistake about it: These vulnerable families in El Salvador and Honduras and Guatemala are being exploited by human traffickers. They take hard cash , American currency , and then take them on the long and dangerous journey north, exploiting them physically along the way. You all know the statistics better than me about the condition that, particularly, young women arrive in when they arrive at our border. And so, we stand here today to say: We're with you. We're grateful for you every single day. But we also stand here today, with these members of Congress at our side, to say: It is time for Congress to act. It is time for Congress to come together and close the loopholes and end this crisis of illegal immigration on our southern border. (Applause.) You're doing your job. It's time they did theirs. (Applause.) So thank you all for being here today. I look forward to meeting as many of you as time permits, but I wanted you know that you not only have the respect of the President of the United States and his Vice President, but, as reflected here in these other officials, I just want to assure you: You have the respect of the American people. The American people are grateful for the work that that ICE does every day. We're grateful for the service of our teams at Homeland Security. We know the work you every day makes our families safer, our communities safer. And so I want to urge you on with confidence of that support and confidence of a grateful nation standing with you and standing beside you. And I also want to urge you on just with a prayer. You know, Congressman Crenshaw made a point in our last meeting. He said, 'You know, it's ' , he's someone who has worn the uniform, been in harm's way , like many of you have as well. And frankly, many of you are every day in your current positions. It's important to remember the risks that you take. You don't dwell on them, your families don't think of them any more than they have to, but we know you take risks. The congressman just said that, 'For people that have ever gone through the door not knowing what's on the other side, I can't fully understand the challenges that you face.' And so while I want you to know that we're going to continue to work to give you the resources and support and the respect that you deserve, we're going to call on the Congress to close the loopholes that are making your job even more challenging every day, I want you to know that you also go with the prayers of the American people and with our prayer. As the Old Book says, that 'His faithfulness will be your shield and your rampart' as you serve. May it be so that you do not fear the terror of the night, or the arrow that flies by day; that no harm will ever overtake you, as you make him your refuge. So we pray. So to the men and women of ICE, the men and women of Homeland Security: On behalf of the President of the United States, these great Texas officials, and your Vice President, thank you for your service. We are with you every step of the way, and we will stay with you until we end this crisis of illegal immigration and fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Thank you all very much, and God bless you. (Applause.)",

         "Thank you, Vice Admiral Lewis, for that kind introduction and those inspiring words. And thank you, sailors. At ease. You may be seated. To Captain Dienna, Captain Snowden, Command Master Chief Carter, to the extraordinary men and women who serve on this ship: It is my great honor to join you aboard America's Lone Warrior, the USS Harry S. Truman, where for more than 20 years you've been 'giving 'em hell' on every deployment. (Applause.) And it's especially great to return to the Truman. You know, I first set foot on this great ship just over 16 years ago, when my wife and I had the privilege of visiting with courageous sailors of this ship when it was deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. We arrived on a COD aircraft. I walked on today. (Laughter.) I preferred coming here on the COD, if you're taking notes. So thanks again for the warm welcome back. And as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine and a great supporter of all of the men and women who wear the uniform of our armed forces. I bring greetings from your Commander-in-Chief and the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) It really is an honor to stand before all of you here at the largest naval base in the world, to stand before men and women who stepped forward to serve in our all-volunteer Navy, to serve in a cause greater than yourselves, and to consider others' lives more important than your own. It is the noble calling, and you've answered the call in the cause of freedom, and you have the respect and gratitude of the American people. As we gather here today to honor what all of you do in the defense of freedom, I know our hearts and the hearts of the American people are elsewhere in this hemisphere, as well with the people of Venezuela as they take to the streets at this very hour in Operation Libertad. As we stand here today aboard this ship, the people of Venezuela are seeking to reclaim freedom and democracy in their nation , a nation impoverished by dictatorship, socialism, and oppression. And so we say to President Juan Guaid�, to all the freedom-loving people of Venezuela: Estamos con ustedes , we are with you. And America will stand with you in this hemisphere of freedom until your democracy is restored. (Applause.) And to the freedom-loving people of Venezuela, we say: As you stand for freedom, we stand with you. Vayan con Dios , go with God. It is an honor to be with all of you today. The United States Navy is the greatest force for good the Seven Seas have ever known. (Applause.) And President Trump asked me to be here today to pay a debt of gratitude and a debt of honor to each of you who have answered the call to serve and stand in defense of this nation, above and below these decks every day. As President Trump said in our first year in office, in his words, 'American sailors are the best warfighting sailors anywhere in the world our carriers are the centerpiece of American military might overseas.' (Applause.) You know, I couldn't be more proud to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and who fights every day on behalf of those who fight for us. You know, after the last administration depleted our military through constant budget cuts, I'm pleased to report to all of you gathered here that President Trump has taken decisive action to rebuild our military, and we are restoring the arsenal of democracy. (Applause.) Last year, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan and called for the building of 350 ship Navy. And we are on our way. (Applause.) In fact, just a few months ago, your Commander-in-Chief proposed the largest defense budget in American history , some $750 billion , to ensure that the strongest fighting force in the history of the world is stronger still. And the President's budget for shipbuilding is the largest shipbuilding request in more than 20 years. (Applause.) The President's budget request would give the United States Navy the resources to buy 12 new battle force ships. We'll fund 55 ships over the Future Years Defense Program, and we'll bring the United States Navy to 355 battle force ships by 2034. (Applause.) And I'm pleased to report the President's budget has given the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States not only the respect that you deserve every day, but the resources. This President signed the largest pay increase for men and women of our armed forces in more than 10 years. (Applause.) And you deserve every single penny. And you can know with confidence that, under President Trump's leadership, we will always give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the support you need to accomplish your mission and come home safe. And our historic investments in our military have already had a critical impact here in the Hampton Roads area. Under President Trump's leadership, Hampton Roads saw three additional vessels homeported here, compared with two years ago. And the largest Navy installation population got even bigger, growing by more than 25,000 families. And while it is very secondary to our national defense, the economic impact of the Navy in this region grew by more than $13 billion. That's more than $600 million of investment in this local economy in Norfolk and in Virginia than just one year ago , promoting prosperity and jobs and support for all of your families. (Applause.) My fellow Americans, I'm also pleased to report to you that that economic growth is not unusual these days, despite what some have been saying lately. Thanks to President Trump's leadership, the American economy is soaring. Over the last two years, businesses large and small have created 5.5 million new jobs, and there are more Americans working today than ever before in American history. This economy is roaring, and America is back. (Applause.) The truth is, the nation that you defend is more prosperous today than ever before. And the peace that you secure is making possible unprecedented growth. And every American is grateful for your service in defense of our freedom, in defense of our nation. You know, it really is an honor to be back aboard the Truman. And looking out at all of you and your shining faces is incredibly inspiring. You all serve this country with great distinction. There's a lot of stories to tell about the people who have served on this ship , past, present, and future , but let me acknowledge a couple of crew members before I leave. Petty Officer Lamont Sewell , where are you? , from Chester, Pennsylvania. Where are you, Lamont? Since joining the United States Navy 18 years ago, Petty Officer Sewell has grown into one of the most skilled aviation support equipment technicians here at Norfolk. He is an incredible sailor. Would you join me in congratulating the Truman's 2018 Sailor of the Year, Petty Officer Lamont Sewell? Great job. (Applause.) We're also joined by another Petty Officer from the Bronx, New York. Throughout her career in the Navy, including her current role as a logistics specialist here aboard the Truman, she's actually consistently upheld the highest levels of professionalism and leadership. And I'm sure it was no surprise to all of you when she was named the Petty Officer of the Year. And let me see if I can , where is Petty Officer Gonzalez at? Let's give her a big round of applause. (Applause.) Great job. Great job. These are just a couple of examples of sailors who have gone above and beyond the call of duty. So I'm grateful that you've joined me in showing your appreciation for their excellence. It's really emblematic what all of you do here each and every day. And the truth is, I have no doubt that these sailors are emblematic of each and every one of you and the service that you provide. But let me also say, as we give credit where credit is due, I know for many of you, you do not serve alone. Mrs. Pence was at Norfolk just a couple of short weeks ago acknowledging the families that are behind our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard. So, how about a big round of applause for the Navy families that are out there , (applause) , and the wonderful spouses and kids that support you each and every day? (Applause.) I know, for so many of you, you couldn't do it , you just couldn't do it without the support of the folks at home, without the spouse, without the encouragement of your kids, without your proud parents. And we remember them today. For more than 20 years, the USS Truman and its crew have played a vital role in defending our nation and protecting our interests across the globe. And it's humbling for me to stand among all of you that have continued that tradition. This ship has served as a constant sign to the world that we will always ensure our security and we will always stand for peace through strength. During each deployment in its prolific career, the USS Truman has taken the fight , taken the fight to the enemy on our terms, on their soil, particularly when it comes to the battle against radical Islamist terrorism. The USS Truman launched over 2,000 sorties throughout the Middle East in the last year alone. And the 7,500 sailors who serve in the Truman's Carrier Strike Group played an essential part in crippling ISIS, bombarding their territory, I'm told with nearly 1,600 precision munitions, the most of any U.S. Strike Group. And now the ISIS caliphate's territory is no more. Job well done, Truman. (Applause.) The Truman has also been there to provide desperately needed relief to Americans suffering in the wake of natural disasters and tragedies, including the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. I'm told the crew of this ship delivered meals, clean water, and other vital supplies to those whose lives were torn apart in that devastating storm. And just last year, this ship helped revolutionize naval warfare when it became the first carrier to deploy under Dynamic Force Employment. This new approach will make our Navy 'strategically predictable, but operationally unpredictable,' ensuring that our readiness and long-term reliability never undermine our security. As part of that deployment, the Truman made history and participated in Trident Juncture, the largest NATO military exercise since the fall of the Berlin Wall. It involved some 14,000 American troops, 29 NATO members. And last year, this ship became the first American carrier to operate within the Arctic Circle in more than two decades. Job well done. You showed the U.S. Navy stands ready to defend America's interests anywhere in the world. (Applause.) You know, this history and these achievements are a testament , a testament to your professionalism, the professionalism that each one of you shows every day. It's inspiring to see. It's a testament to your dedication, your leadership, and the remarkable efficiency and command readiness. I'm told, last year, actually, the USS Truman was awarded the 'Battle E,' which is given to the ship that demonstrates the highest level of performance of any carrier on the East Coast. Give yourselves a round of applause. (Applause.) That's just a sign of excellence and commitment that's making our nation safer. I'm here to tell you that President Trump and I are proud of the Truman. In fact, I met with the President at the White House this morning, and I told him I was going to be with all of you here on the deck of the Truman. And I can assure you the President and I understand the importance of the work that you do every day. And I know that I speak on behalf of all the American people when I say that we couldn't be more proud and we couldn't be more grateful for your patriotism and your selflessness. And as I stand before you today, I know that the future of this aircraft carrier is the subject of some budget discussions in Washington, D.C. And as we continue to fight Congress to make sure that our military has the resources you need to accomplish your mission, President Donald Trump asked me to deliver a message to each and every one of you on the deck of the USS Truman: We are keeping the best carrier in the world in the fight. We are not retiring the Truman. (Applause.) The USS Harry S. Truman is going to be 'giving 'em hell' for many more years to come. (Applause.) You know, the ship you serve aboard bears a proud and noble name. It's a man who distinguished himself as an artillery officer in World War I. He answered the call to public service. He served in the United States Senate, was a Vice President, and then President of the United States of America. But throughout his life, Harry S. Truman was tried and tested, and he always met the challenge , just like all of you. Through adversity, his greatness emerged. And history now records the enormous contributions that President Harry S. Truman made to the life of this nation. You all have been tested, as well, during your service here aboard the ship that bears his name. And you've shown your greatness as well. So to all of you who serve here aboard the USS Harry S. Truman, this Vice President has a simple word for you: Thank you for your service. And I urge you to press on. Maintain the standards of excellence that are synonymous with this ship throughout its more than 20-year history. Be vigilant. Mind your mission. Take care of one another. The American people are counting on you. You know, my life never took me into the uniform of the United States, but I'm the proud son of a combat veteran from the Korean War, and I'm the proud father of an aviator in the United States Marine Corps. In fact, just last year, as his mother and I were awaiting word, our son did his first capture aboard an aircraft carrier. I think we were more nervous than he was. (Laughter.) The truth of the matter is, we were confident not so much in his abilities, but in the people that had trained him; the people on that deck that were looking after him as they called the ball and made his way in. So let me just close today with a word of gratitude on behalf of all the parents around America who appreciate what you do, appreciate the way you look after our sailors, our airmen, and all those who serve on this ship, who come and go into harm's way from this place and sail with you into harm's way. We all know that your service comes with sacrifice for you, for your families. And I want you to know that as you serve and as you sail, you do not go alone. You carry with you the strength and the pride and the confidence of the American people.And you also carry with you one more thing, and that is the prayers of millions of Americans who carry each one of you before the throne of grace every day, who pray for your families and for your mission, for your safety, and for your success. And I pray that as you sail and as you serve, you would do so with confidence and with faith yourself. And as the Old Book tells us, 'If rise on the wings of the dawn if go up to the heavens even there hand will guide and right hand will hold fast.' And you do not go alone. As I look out across this deck today, I see men and women who have answered the call to put on the uniform of the United States of America, the greatest nation in the history of the world. And I know, as long as we have men and women of courage and selflessness, like all of you gathered here; as long as we have heroes willing to put the lives on the line for our freedom; as long as we have patriots like all of you, we will protect this nation. We will defend our freedom. We will forge a future of security, and prosperity, and peace for ourselves and our posterity. God bless the crew of the USS Harry S. Truman as you sail on in defense of America. Thank you. And God bless you. (Applause.)",

         "GOOD AFTERNOON. ON THE EVE OF THE 57TH MARCH ON WASHINGTON, I WILL SPEAK ABOUT RECENT EVENTS IN KENOSHA, WISCONSIN, WILDFIRES RAGING ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA COAST TOMORROW , AND ROCKY MOUNTAIN. THE STORM WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH TEXAS, LOUISIANA, AND THE GULF COAST, AND MOST OF ALL, WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. WE ARE A NATION AT ITS BEST LOVES, PROTECTS, AND HELPS FELLOW AMERICANS. TODAY, WE SEE PAIN, HURT, AND DESTRUCTION. WE ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO CONTINUE FOLLOWING GUIDANCE FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO STAY SAFE. JOE AND I PLEDGE TO BE THERE FOR THOSE WHOSE LIVES WERE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. THOSE WHO NEED HELP FROM NEIGHBORS, STRANGERS, AND OUR GOVERNMENT TO MAKE IT THROUGH, TO RESTORE YOUR LIVES AND COMMUNITY. WE ALSO SEE PAIN, HURT, AND DESTRUCTION IN THE AFTERMATH OF YET ANOTHER BLACK MAN SHOT BY POLICE. JACOB BLAKE SHOT SEVEN TIMES IN THE BACK IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS THREE YOUNG SONS. SEVEN TIMES, IN THE BACK, IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS THREE YOUNG SONS. AS VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN PUT IT, THE SHOTS FIRED AT MR. BLAKE PIERCED THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. IT IS SICKENING TO WATCH. IT IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR. IT MUST END. THANKFULLY, HE IS ALIVE TODAY BUT HE IS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE WHEN HE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE. MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE FAMILY AS THEY ENDURE THE ORDEAL THAT IS TRAGICALLY COMMON IN OUR COUNTRY. JOE AND I SPOKE WITH THEM YESTERDAY. THEY ARE AN AMAZING GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE, EVEN AS THEY SEEK JUSTICE FOR THEIR SON, THEY SPOKE ABOUT THE NEED TO END THE VIOLENCE AND HEAL OUR NATION. I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH FAR TOO MANY MOTHERS AND FATHERS. YOU WILL SEE AND HEAR NO ONE WITH MORE COURAGE, MORE CHARACTER, AND MORE MORAL CLARITY. PEOPLE ARE RIGHTFULLY ANGRY AND EXHAUSTED. AFTER THE MURDERS OF RIHANNA, AND SO MANY OTHERS, IT IS NO WONDER PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS. I SUPPORT THEM. WE MUST ALWAYS DEFEND PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. WE SHOULD NOT CONFUSE THEM WITH LOOTING AND COMMITTING ACTS OF VIOLENCE, INCLUDING THE SHOOTER, WHO WAS ARRESTED FOR MURDER. MAKE NO MISTAKE. WE WILL NOT LET VIGILANTES AND EXTREMISTS DERAIL THE PATH TO JUSTICE. HERE IS MY PROMISE TO THOSE MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND THOSE WHO STAND WITH THEM. A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION, YOU WILL HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE, IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS, AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE ALL GREW UP CITING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE BUT NOW, WE MUST GIVE REAL MEETING , MEANING TO HIS WORDS. ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE, FOR ALL. JUSTICE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. THE REALITY IS THAT THE LIFE OF A BLACK PERSON IN AMERICA HAS NEVER BEEN TREATED AS FULLY HUMAN. WE HAVE YET TO FULFILL THE PROMISE OF EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. WE WILL ONLY ACHIEVE THAT WHEN WE FINALLY COME TOGETHER TO PASS MEANINGFUL POLICE REFORM AND BROADER CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND ACKNOWLEDGE AND ADDRESS SYSTEMIC RACISM. WE WILL ONLY COME CLOSER TO ACHIEVING THAT WHEN WE FINALLY COME TOGETHER. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY TOWARD BUILDING A PERFECT UNION BUT THE TIME IS NOW TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP FORWARD. EVEN AS THEY WE HAVE A RECKONING WITH RACIAL INJUSTICE, WE MUST ALSO CONFRONT ANOTHER CRISIS. THE PANDEMIC THAT HAS TORN APART SO MANY LIVES. WE CANNOT LOOK THE OTHER WAY OR ALLOW OURSELVES TO SUCCUMB TO THEM. NEARLY 6 MILLION CONFIRMED CASES OF THE CORONAVIRUS. 180,000 LIVES LOST. MORE THAN 50 MILLION CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT THIS YEAR ALONE. WE NEED TO SEE AND HEAR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY. HOPING FOOD BANKS HAVE SOMETHING LEFT WHEN THEY GET TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE. THE 50-YEAR-OLD STORE MANAGER WHO HAS BEEN LAID OFF AND KNOWS HE CANNOT PAY THE RENT AND THE FIRST OF THE MONTH. MOTHERS AND FATHERS STRETCHED TO THE BREAKING POINT, WORKING FROM HOME, WHILE HELPING THEIR KIDS WITH ONLINE CLASSES. TRYING TO HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER. ECONOMIC ENGINES OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE SHUTTING THEIR DOORS EVERY DAY. THE NURSE, GETTING READY FOR HER AFTERNOON SHIFT, GIVEN SO MUCH SUFFERING AND DEATH IN RECENT MONTHS, WONDERS HOW MUCH MORE SHE COULD BEAR TO WITNESS. THE FAMILY GRIEVING THE LOSS OF THEIR MOTHER. COULD NOT EVEN VISIT IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF HER LIFE. THE ALARMING AND DISPROPORTIONATE RATE AT WHICH BLACKS AND LATINOS AND INDIGENOUS FAMILIES ARE CONTRACTING AND DYING OF COVID-19. THAT IS THE REALITY NOW. A REALITY COMPLETELY ABSENT FROM THIS WEEK'S REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. UNLIKE THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION, WHICH WAS VERY CLEAR I'D ABOUT THE CHALLENGE WE WERE FACING AND HOW TO TACKLE THEM, THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IS DESIGNED FOR ONE PURPOSE. TO SOOTH DONALD TRUMP'S EGO. TO MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD. HERE'S THE THING. HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT HIM. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BY THAT MEASURE, DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENCY. HE THINKS IT IS ABOUT HIM. IT IS NOT. IT IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US. THE PEOPLE. I WOULD SAY THE FOLLOWING WORDS. KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY A STAND TODAY TO SPEAK FOR THE PEOPLE. WE KNOW THE TRUTH. DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED AT THE MOST BASIC JOB OF THE UNITED STATES. HE FAILED TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. TRUMP SHOWED THAT WE IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION WOULD CALL A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE DANGER A PANDEMIC WOULD PROPOSE FOR AMERICAN LIVES, FOR THE DEVASTATION IT WOULD DO TO OUR , TO OUR ECONOMY. FOR THE DAMAGE IT WOULD DO TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO STRUCTURAL RACISM FOR GENERATIONS. FOR THE CHAOS THAT WOULD UPEND OUR DAILY LIVES, MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR CHILDREN TO GO TO SCHOOL. HE NEVER APPRECIATED A PRESIDENT SWEARS AN OATH BEFORE GOD AND COUNTRY TO PROTECT AMERICA AGAINST THREATS SEEN AND UNSEEN. IT IS HIS DUTY, IT IS HIS OBLIGATION TO PROTECT US. AND YET HE HAS FAILED, MISERABLY. HERE IS THE THING. DONALD TRUMP'S INCOMPETENCE IS NOTHING NEW. THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON FULL DISPLAY. IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, IT BECAME DEADLY. THAT IS WHEN THE THREAT OF A VIRUS THAT WOULD ENDANGER THE WORLD FIRST EMERGED. TRUMP DISMISSED THE THREAT, BUT JOE BIDEN SOUNDS THE ALARM. IT WOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A PATTERN THAT PERSISTS TO THIS DAY. TRUMP TELLING US NOT TO WORRY, THAT THE VIRUS WILL DISAPPEAR, THAT A MIRACLE IS COMING. JOE BIDEN SAYING WE NEED A PLAN, IN NATIONAL STRATEGY, A PRESIDENT WHO IS WILLING TO LEAD , WILLING TO BE A ROLE MODEL FOR OUR NATION, FOR OUR CHILDREN. TRUMP STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN. HE STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN. JOE BIDEN RELEASED HIS FIRST PLAN IN MARCH. AND HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE PANDEMIC. IT IS RELENTLESS. YOU CANNOT STOP IT WITH A TWEET. YOU CANNOT CREATE A DISTRACTION AND HOPE IT WILL GO AWAY. IT DOES NOT GO AWAY. BY ITS NATURE, IT PANDEMIC IS UNFORGIVING. IF YOU GET IT WRONG AT THE BEGINNING, THE CONSEQUENCES ARE CATASTROPHIC. IT IS VERY HARD TO CATCH UP AND YOU DO NOT GET A SECOND CHANCE. PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT IT WRONG FROM THE BEGINNING. THEN HE GOT IT WRONG AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC. HERE IS WHY TRUMP HAS BEEN SO UNWILLING AND UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THE CRISIS. HE WAS ON FIXATING , FIXING THE PROBLEM. HE SAID IT WOULD HURT THE MARKET AND HURT HIS CHANCES OF BEING REELECTED. THAT MATTERED TO HIM MORE THAN SAVING AMERICAN LIVES. RIGHT AT THE MOMENT WE NEEDED DONALD TRUMP TO BE TOUGH ON THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, HE CAVED. ON JANUARY 24, HE PRAISED THE PIT , THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. HE SAID CHINA HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TO DETAIN THE CORONAVIRUS. THE UNITED STATES GREATLY AND , APPRECIATES THEIR EFFORTS AND TRANSPARENCY AND IT WILL ALL END WELL. THEY BLOCKED PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTORS FROM OUR CDC INNING ACCESS AND INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES. DONALD TRUMP STOOD IDLY BY AND IT WAS A DEADLY DECISION. DONALD TRUMP FROZE. HE WAS SCARED. AND HE WAS PETTY AND FIGMENT IT , AND VINDICTIVE. HE TOLD THEM IT WAS NOT HIS JOB TO GIVE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO FRONTLINE WORKERS. HE SAYS, 'RESPIRATORS, VENTILATORS, ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT, TRY GETTING IT YOURSELVES.' ON THAT DAY WE HAVE , TODAY, WE HAVE NEARLY 6 MILLION. EVEN NOW, DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND WILL NOT ACT. THE TRAGEDY IN ALL OF THIS IS IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. JUST LOOK AROUND. IT IS NOT LIKE THIS AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. ALL WE NEEDED, GUYS, ALL WE NEEDED WAS A COMPETENT PRESIDENT. ONE WHO IS WILLING TO LISTEN. WILLING TO LEAD. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, HAVE A PLAN. DO THEIR JOBS. JOE BIDEN WILL BE THAT PRESIDENT. HE HAS GOT A NATIONAL STRATEGY. HE IS MORE THAN READY TO LEAD. EVERY MONTH SINCE MARCH, AS THE PANDEMIC HAS UNFOLDED, JOE BIDEN HAS UPDATED STEPS HE WOULD TAKE TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES AND HE HAS DONE IT BASED ON WHAT EVERY SCIENTIST, EXPERT, AND ECONOMIST SAYS WE SHOULD BE DOING. JOE BIDEN WILL PUT A PLAN INTO EFFECT ON DAY ONE, DEPLOY RAPID TESTS WITH IMMEDIATE RESULTS, MAKE SURE TREATMENTS AND ULTIMATELY, A VACCINE, REACH ALL AMERICANS, INCLUDING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, WHICH HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LEFT BEHIND. MANUFACTURER THE EQUIPMENT WE NEED AND MAKE THEM RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA SO WE ARE NEVER AGAIN AT THE MERCY OF CHINA AND OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE. JOE AND I WILL MAKE SURE SCHOOLS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE OPEN AND SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. PUT POLITICS ASIDE AND NOT SILENCE THE EXPERTS SO PUBLIC GETS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED AND DESERVE. AND PUT IN PLACE A NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATE. IT IS NOT A BURDEN TO PROTECT EACH OTHER. HE SAYS THAT BECAUSE THE THING ABOUT JOE IS, HE KNOWS WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. DONALD TRUMP SAYS THERE IS NOTHING HE COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT ALL OF THIS DEATH. BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN HAD A PROGRAM CALLED PROTECT. THE PROGRAM TRACKED EMERGING DISEASES IN PLACES LIKE CHINA. TRUMP CUT IT. THEY CREATED THAT TEAM IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, DEDICATING THEM TO THE WORK IN BIO DEFENSE. THEY IMPLEMENTED STANZEL , STANDARDS TO IMPROVE INFECTION CONTROL. DONALD TRUMP IS ERASING THEM. BEFORE THE VIRUS HIT, TRUMP MADE US VULNERABLE. HE FAILED TO DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY. AS IT CONTINUES, HE IS MAKING IT WORSE EVERY DAY. JUST THIS WEEK, THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION SAID A CUT TO SOCIAL SECURITY LIKE THE ONE TRUMP IS PROPOSING WOULD END DISABILITY BENEFITS WITHIN ONE YEAR. AND ALL BENEFITS WITHIN THREE YEARS. LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE. IF DONALD TRUMP'S EXTREME PROPOSAL GOES INTO EFFECT, THE CHECKS THAT AMERICAN SENIORS ARE RELYING ON, THAT YOU RELY ON, TO PAY YOUR BILLS, TO BUYER MEDICINE, TO LIVE, WILL STOP COMING. THE VERY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY IN THIS CRISIS, IT IS UNTHINKABLE. IN THE MIDDLE OF A HEALTH CRISIS MADE WORSE BY HIS OWN ACTIONS, DONALD TRUMP IS IN COURT RIGHT NOW, TRYING TO THROW OUT THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, INCLUDING PROTECTIONS IT PROVIDES FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THAT MEANS IF YOU ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SURVIVE COVID-19, INSURERS COULD DENY YOU COVERAGE FOR TREATING ANY LONG-TERM EFFECTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NOT TELL YOU ANY OF THIS AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION TONIGHT. WE ALL KNOW HE IS NOT CHANGING. THE PRESIDENT HE HAS BEEN IS THE PRESIDENT HE WILL BE. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO RIGHT THESE WRONGS AND PUT AMERICA ON A BETTER PATH FORWARD. LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS AND FOLLOW THE BEST MEDICAL GUIDANCE TO KEEP US AND KEEP FAMILIES SAFE. ONE WHERE WE TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION AGAINST SYSTEMS AND TRADITIONS OF OPPRESSION. ONE WHERE WE STOP FANNING THE FLAMES OF HATE AND DIVISION AND TREAT ONE ANOTHER WITH THE RESPECT AND DIGNITY THAT EACH ONE OF US DESERVES. AS JOE BIDEN SAID, WE HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK. I BELIEVE AMERICA WILL CHOOSE THE LIGHT. THANK YOU.",

         "Thank you, Acting Secretary Shanahan, Secretary Mark Esper, Secretary Wilson, distinguished members of Congress, members of the Joint Chiefs, the leadership of the Armed Forces of the United States, and to all of you who wear the uniform of the United States of America. It is my honor to be with you here today at the Pentagon as our President unveils his vision for our renewed commitment to American missile defense. As Commander-in-Chief, President Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people. And it's, frankly, the greatest honor of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families. Today, along with all of you, our hearts and our prayers are with the families of the fallen American heroes who were lost in Syria yesterday, as well as those service members who were wounded. We honor their service and we will honor the memory of the fallen. And their families and our Armed Forces should know their sacrifice will only steel our resolve; that as we begin to bring our troops home, we will do so in a way that ensures that the remnants of ISIS will never be able to reestablish their evil and murderous caliphate. It's in that same spirit of resolve that we gather here today. Since day one of this administration, President Trump has taken decisive action to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. Working with members of Congress in both parties, we're rebuilding our military, restoring the arsenal of democracy. And last year, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the largest military pay raise in nearly a decade. At the President's direction, we released a National Security Strategy that puts America first, pursued the modernization of our nuclear arsenal. And President Trump has taken decisive action to extend American dominance on land, at sea, in air, and in cyberspace, and even called for the establishment of a sixth branch of our Armed Forces to ensure American dominance in space. In the last two years, our President has made great progress to provide for the common defense. And today, by unveiling our new strategy for missile defense, President Trump will take another critical step to ensure the safety and security of the American people and our very way of life. This President knows that the American people believe that America First begins with peace through strength. So now it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce your Commander-in-Chief, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.",

HE HAS INSULTED, DEMONIZED, THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY EMPATHY, COMPASSION. NO REGARD FOR THE VALUES THAT MADE THIS COUNTRY THE WAY WE ARE. NOT THE WAY YOU WERE RAISED BY YOUR MOM AND DAD. HE LACKS THE HONESTY, DECENCY AND RESPECT. HE USES IT AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS. HE DOES NOT BELIEVE WE ARE A BEACON OF THE WORLD. HE DOES NOT BELIEVE WE ARE ALL PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. THAT IS WHY I SAID THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCED THIS CANDIDACY, WE ARE LIVING IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. FOLKS, WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA, NOT SOWING SEEDS OF DIVISION AND ANGER AND HATE. WE HAVE GOT TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND WE WILL, BUT WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE HIM. WE CAN'T HAVE A NEVER ENDING WAR BETWEEN THE PARTIES. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN FIGHT. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, I CAN FIGHT. BUT LOOK, WE NEED AS BADLY, SOMEONE WHO CAN HEAL. WHEN WE PASSED OBAMACARE, WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I DID, SAVING THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, WHAT WE DID TO PASS THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, IT WAS NOT ENOUGH. IT WAS JUST A START. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN HEAL THE COUNTRY AS WELL. THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT. I PROMISE YOU. IT IS ABOUT DELIVERING REAL RESULTS FOR YOU, YOUR FAMILY, AND THE COMMUNITY. IT IS NOT ABOUT ME, JILL, OR VALERIE. IT IS ABOUT YOU, ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES. PARAPHRASING ROBERT BROWN. HE SAID, 'OUR REACH SHOULD EXCEED OUR GRASP.' THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND WE CAN GRASP WHAT EVER WE REACH FOR. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I QUOTE AN ENGLISH POET , LET ME CLICK A REAL POET NOW, AN IRISH POET. HE WROTE A POEM CALLED 'THE CURE OF TROY.' I BELIEVE THIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY BEING. HE SAID, HISTORY SAYS, DON'T HOPE ON THIS SIDE OF THE GRAVE, BUT THEN ONCE IN A LIFETIME, THE TIDAL WAVE OF JUSTICE RISES UP AND HOPE IN HISTORY RISE. WE CAN MAKE HOPE IN HISTORY RHYME. THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT DO. THIS IS ABOUT THE FUTURE. NOT ABOUT THE PAST. IT IS ABOUT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN. IT IS ABOUT LEADING THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN. FOLKS, WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. BY LORD, THIS IS USENET OFFICIAL AMERICA. IT IS TIME FOR THEM , THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT IS TIME FOR AMERICA TO GET BACK UP AND ONCE AGAIN STAND UP TO THE POSITION THAT WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN WERE CREATED EQUAL. WE HAVE TO REALIZE HOW PROFOUND THAT STATEMENT IS. WE NEVER LIVED UP TO THOSE WORDS. AFTER THIS PRESIDENT, WE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT. I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING THAT THAT IS WHO WE ARE. SO LET'S GET BACK UP, WE ARE A DECENT, BRAVE AND RESILIENT PEOPLE. WE CAN BELIEVE AGAIN. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS MOMENT. BETTER THAN THIS PRESIDENT. SO GET BACK UP AND TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE CAN'T DO. GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!",

         "HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. HELLO. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. HELLO, LAS VEGAS. GOVERNOR'S IS A LACK, REPRESENTATIVE TITUS AND MY GOOD FRIEND , ACTUALLY HE IS A GREAT FRIEND , CONGRESSMAN WERE SPURRED. I WANT TO THANK THE PRINCIPLE OF THIS GREAT SCHOOL, , PRINCIPAL OF THIS GREAT SCHOOL FOR HOSTING THIS. JUST WHAT YOU NEED IT TODAY. I KNOW YOU , JUST WHAT YOU NEEDED TODAY. I KNOW YOU WANT THE STUDENTS TO BE BACK. I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE DURING THIS CHALLENGING TIME. ALARCON DROVE, THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION , ALEJANDRO, THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION. YOU AND ALL THOSE WHO CHOSE TO COME HERE TO BECOME PARENTS IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU ARE WHY WE ARE WHO WE ARE. THANK YOU. YOU ARE JUST TRY TO DO RIGHT BY YOUR FAMILY, LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I JUST LEFT THE LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY CENTER WHERE SENATOR ED FLOREZ, THE SON OF MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS , YOU GET TO SWEAR IN HIS DAD AS THE UNITED STATES CITIZEN LAST WEEK. HE BECAME A LAWYER TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF IMMIGRANTS AND MAKE SURE , I'M THAT WITH A GROUP OF LATINO LEADERS WHO WILL FIGHT FOR RESPECT AND DIGNITY WE ARE ALL ENTITLED TO, NO MATTER WHO WE ARE OR WHERE WE COME FROM. YESTERDAY, I MET WITH KAMALA HARRIS AFTER HER OUTSTANDING DEBATE PERFORMANCE. I COULD NOT BE PROUDER TO BE RUNNING ALONGSIDE HER. SHE IS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR THE PEOPLE, LOOKING OUT FOR YOU. WE MET WITH CINDY MCCAIN. THE WIFE, THE WIDOW, OF A DEAR FRIEND JOHN MCCAIN. WE MET WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, JUST A FAIR SHOT. WHEN I WAS IN GRADE SCHOOL MY DAD WOULD SAY , WE HAD TO MOVE IN WITH MY GRANDPARENTS WHEN HE WENT DOWN SOUTH FROM SCRANTON TO WILMINGTON, DELAWARE LOOKING FOR A JOB. HE USED TO ALWAYS SAY, YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS JOEY, I'M NOT LOOKING FOR GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS. I HOPE THEY CAN AT LEAST UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. HE WORKED HARD TO BUILD A DECENT MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. IT WASN'T EASY FOR HIM. HE HAD AN EXPRESSION. A JOB, JOEY, IS ABOUT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT BEING IN TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. YOU DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH, WHO SEES WHERE YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. THE LAST THING YOU NEED IS A PRESIDENT WHO IGNORES YOU, WHO LOOKS DOWN UPON YOU, AND JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE GOT WHERE WE ARE. THAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP. HIS RECKLESS PERSONAL CONDUCT SINCE HIS DIAGNOSIS, THE DESTABILIZING EFFECT ON OUR GOVERNMENT IS UNCONSCIONABLE. HE DID NOT TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO PROTECT HIMSELF OR OTHERS AND THE LONGER DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENTS, THE MORE , IS PRESIDENT, THE MORE RECKLESS HE GETS. HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO PROTECT THIS COUNTRY? GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE SEEN HOW HE PUTS GOVERNORS AGAINST EACH OTHER. MORE THAN 200,000 AMERICANS ARE DEAD. WE LOSE FROM 700 TO 1000 PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY IN AMERICA, WORSE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. MORE THAN 7.5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN INFECTED AND WE ARE STILL COUNTING. IN NEVADA, THERE ARE MORE THAN 82,000 CASES. 80% OF THE DEATHS HAVE BEEN SENIORS OVER 60 YEARS OF AGE, BLACK, LATINO, NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ARE ESPECIALLY HIT HARD. NATIONALLY THE INFECTION RATE AMONG LATINOS IS NEARLY THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OF OTHER , MY HEART GOES OUT TO ALL THIS FAMILIES. THIS MORNING, THERE IS AN EMPTY CHAIR AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE AND WHEN YOU GO TO DINNER AT NIGHT THE PERSON WHO SHOULD BE THERE IS GONE. THEY HAVE LOST PART OF THEIR SOUL. THEY HAVE LOST PART OF THEIR LIFE. IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY. FOR YOU AND I, IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY. LOSING FAMILY IS A DEVASTATING THING. WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER. MY HEART GOES OUT TO EVERYONE STRUGGLING WITH THE ECONOMIC CRISIS CAUSED BY THE SIMPLE NEGLECT OF THIS PRESIDENT. NEARLY I'M , 11 MILLION JOBS LOST THE BEGINNING OF THIS CRISIS AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT COME BACK. TEMPORARY LAYOFFS HAVE TURNED TO PERMANENT LAYOFFS. RECORD GROWTH AND AMERICANS FACING LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE PROBLEM OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT, ONCE YOU GET PAST A CERTAIN POINT HISTORY TELLS US, THEY NEVER GET A JOB AGAIN. ALL TOLD THERE'S 30 MILLION WORKERS WHO HAVE LOST HOURS, LOST PAYCHECKS, OR LOST THEIR JOBS. YULIA 700,000 PEOPLE HAVE DROPPED OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE AND THE VAST MAJORITY WERE WOMEN . WE ARE STILL DOWN 600 47,000 JOBS IN MANUFACTURING NATIONWIDE SINCE THE CRISIS STARTED. HERE IN NEVADA THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 13.2%, THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NEGLIGENCE. THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY HAS BEEN HIT PARTICULARLY HARD. 50% OF THOSE MEMBERS ARE OUT OF WORK. TOURISM WENT DOWN 70% FROM A YEAR AGO. THE RESULT? PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY SINCE HOOVER TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS THAN WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE. HERE IN NEVADA, AFTER SEEING 200,000 JOBS CREATED IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OF THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, THEY HAVE SEEN JOBS GO DOWN UNDER THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. HE IS LEAVING US INTO WHAT HE CALLS A V-SHAPED RECESSION. IT IS A K-SHAPED RECESSION. FOR THOSE OF THE TOPIC KEEPS GOING. FOR THE MIDDLE LEFT US FOR THOSE AT THE TOP, IT KEEPS GOING UP. FOR THOSE AT THE BOTTOM, IT KEEPS GOING DOWN. IS THE MOST UNEQUAL RECOVERY IN MODERN HISTORY. IF YOU GET THIS , THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA HAVE DONE PRETTY WELL. JUST IN THE PANDEMIC, THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES HAVE MADE AN ADDITIONAL $3 BILLION. TOP 100. WHEN YOU GET TO THE BOTTOM HALF OF THAT K, IT'S A DOWNWARD SLIDE. YOU'RE LEFT TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU WILL PAY YOUR BILLS, PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. SO MUCH FOOD INSECURITY AND AMERICA. BECAUSE OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PRESIDENT, THE KIDS CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE HE HAS NOT PROVIDED THE WHEREWITHAL FOR SCHOOLS TO OPEN. YOU'RE ASKED TO RISK YOUR NET BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WORK FROM HOME. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE A POLICE OFFICER, A NURSE FOR YOU WORK ON AN ASSEMBLY LINE. IF YOU ARE A HOUSEKEEPER, A CASINO WORKER , GOVERNOR, YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO TURN THINGS AROUND. GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE BEEN FOCUSED AND RESPONSIBLE. YOU FOLLOWED SCIENCE AND PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST. YOU MAKE CALLS TO REOPEN SCHOOLS IN THE ECONOMY SAFELY. YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE DONE THE SAME. AND THE HOUSE PASSED WHAT THEY CALL THE HEROES ACT MONTHS AGO. WOULD HAVE PROVIDED ALIENS OF DOLLARS TO KEEP FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE JOB. BUT DONALD TRUMP AND MITCH MCCONNELL, THE REPUBLICAN LEADER, DID NOTHING TO MOVE THE LEGISLATION. NOTHING IN JUNE, NOTHING IN AUGUST, NOTHING IN SEPTEMBER. THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. AS PEOPLE STRUGGLE AND SUFFER, WHAT DO THEY FOCUS ON. IF THIS WERE NOT SO SERIOUS YOU WOULD THINK I WAS MAKING IT UP. WHAT DO THEY FOCUS ON? MORE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY. I'M NOT JOKING. HIS PROPOSAL HAS ANOTHER TAX CUT FOR MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES. CUTTING THE MEANS BY WHICH WE FIND THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, LEAVING THE ACTUARIES TO SAY IF THEY DO IT, BY MID-2023 THERE WILL BE NO MONEY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. AND THE RELENTLESS EFFORT TO ELIMINATE THE OF PORTABLE CARE ACT WHICH PROVIDES HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR 22 MILLION PEOPLE. , 20 BILLION PEOPLE, 100 MILLION WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. HE HAS ALREADY COST 10 MILLION PEOPLE FOR , THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE THE COMPANIES HAVE GONE BANKRUPT. IS UNCONSCIONABLE , IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE. HE'S TRYING TO TAKE YOUR HEALTH CARE AWAY. IT'S LITERALLY BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AS I SPEAK, TO STRIKE DOWN THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ONE HUNDRED 82,000 NEVADANS. , 182,000 NEVADANS. TAKE AWAY PROTECTION FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID COULD VERY WELL BE THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. TOSSING OUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT ALLOWS CHILDREN TO BE COVERED ON THEIR PARENTS' INSURANCE POLICY UNTIL AT LEAST 26, TAKING US BACKWARD WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD CHARGE A WOMAN MORE JUST BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN. TAKE AWAY MEDICARE BENEFITS FOR SENIORS, INCREASED DRUG PRESCRIPTION COSTS, AND JUST AS HE VOWED TO 'TERMINATE' THE FUNDING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. THE IDEA THAT IN JUST A FEW YEARS TO PUT AT RISK FOR HUNDRED 10,000 NEVADA TO RELY ON A DIGNIFIED RETIREMENT BECAUSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY , 410,000 NEVADANS WHO RELY ON A DIGNIFIED RETIREMENT BECAUSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY. NOT ONCE DID PRESIDENT TRUMP CALL A HIGH LEVEL MEETING OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES. I HAVE SERVED WITH A LOT OF PRESIDENTS. NEVER DID THEY FAIL TO TRY TO BRING PARTIES TOGETHER IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO REACH A SETTLEMENT. YOU KNOW WHY? HE SPENDS SO MUCH TIME HIDING IN THE BUNKER IN THE WHITE HOUSE, OR THE BUNKER OFF HIS GOLF COURSE, PLAYING HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS OF GOLF, AND THEN THIS TUESDAY, WHAT DID HE DO? HE SAID INTO THE DISCUSSIONS. HE WAS NOT EVEN STARTING THEM. NO MORE NEGOTIATIONS, NO MORE NEGOTIATIONS. AND TODAY HE SAYS, WELL, I'M BACK. DONALD TRUMP SHOWS NO URGENCY TO DELIVER HARD-WORKING AMERICANS, LIKE THE FAMILY I GREW UP IN AND LIKE ALL OF YOU, WHAT THEY NEED NOW, DESPERATELY. FOR EXACTLY TWO MONTHS SINCE THE EMERGENCY SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM THE CONGRESSPEOPLE VOTED FOR HAS CLOSE DOWN. TWO MONTHS OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN NEVADA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY WAITING AND HOPING FOR JUST A LITTLE EXTRA HELP TO STAY OPEN. NOW WE HAVE OVER 400,000 SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSED. MILLIONS MORE ARE STRUGGLING TO HANG ON. HOW MANY MORE WILL GO UNDER? MAKE NO MISTAKE, IF YOUR BUSINESS IS CLOSED, IF YOU ARE FACING EVICTION, OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS WORRY WHETHER THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE NEXT MONTH. NONE OF THAT SEEMS TO MATTER TO DONALD TRUMP. IF YOU ARE A FIREFIGHTER OR A POLICE OFFICER, HE HAS TURNED HIS BACK ON YOU AS WELL. WHEN BARACK AND I WERE ELECTED WE INHERITED THE WORST RECESSION SHORT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN HISTORY. WE PUT TOGETHER THE RECOVERY ACT. WE PUT TOGETHER IN 18 MONTHS TO PREVENT A RECESSION. I WAS ABLE TO SEE TO IT THAT THE STATES COULD KEEP MOVING, KEEP TEACHERS, FIRST RESPONDERS, FIREFIGHTERS MOVING. RIGHT HERE IN CLARK COUNTY I WAS ABLE TO BRING $1.2 BILLION TO KEEP YOUR ECONOMY GOING. WE HAVE THAT ABILITY NOW. THE HOUSE HAS ALREADY PASSED A SIMILAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND WE START THE LONGEST SUSTAINED RECOVERY IN AMERICAN HISTORY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL SAID ABOUT HELPING THE STATE? I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP. HE SAID, LET THEM GO BANKRUPT, LET THEM GO BANKRUPT. WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING ABOUT? WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE CAN CONTAIN THIS VIRUS AND FULLY REOPEN OUR ECONOMY. WE MAKE UP 4% OF THE WORLDS POPULATION AND WE HAVE 20% OF THE WORLD'S DEATHS. IF WE JUST FOLLOW THE SCIENCE, EXPANDED TESTING AND TRACING, SOCIAL DISTANCING, WASHING HER HANDS, NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATE , WASHING YOUR HANDS, NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATES. DON'T POLITICIZE THE RACE FOR A VACCINE, MR. PRESIDENT. JUST HAVE A PLAN FOR A SAFE AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION. HAVE A REAL PLAN AND THEN IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA I HAVE LAID OUT TO MAKE BOLD INVESTMENTS SO WE CAN LOOK BACK BETTER. HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS , SOME ARE IN SUPPORT OF ME. HE SAYS BIDEN IS GOING TO SPEND ALL THIS MONEY. MOODY DID A DETAILED ANALYSIS. MY ECONOMY WILL CREATE 18.6 MILLION JOBS, 7 MILLION MORE JOBS THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. YOU HAVE GOT TO GET THINGS DONE. THIS IS HOW MY PLAN IS , WORKS. IT IS NOT GOING TO RAISE UP HENNEY OF TAX. NOT A PENNY. HOW DO WE PAY FOR ALL THIS? I WOULD ASK THE CORPORATIONS AND THE WEALTHY TO START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. 92 DO NOT , 92 MILLION DO NOT PAY A PENALTY , A PENNY IN TALKING , AND TAXES. DONALD TRUMP PAID $720 IN TAXES? COME ON. THE MONEY WE RAISED BY LIMITING THE $1.3 TRILLION OF THE TAX CUTS THAT AFFECTS THE SUPER WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS, WE WILL GROW THE ECONOMY TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS INCLUDED ON THE DEAL. THE KINDS OF INVESTMENT THAT WILL STIMULATE THE ECONOMY,'S INCLUDING INDUSTRIES LIKE TOURISM. TO HELP THE ECONOMY BUILD BACK BETTER THAN BEFORE. IT MEANS CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS, MANUFACTURING AND SAID KNOWLEDGE HE, DUST TECHNOLOGY, MAKING SURE OUR FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA. WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE GIVES OUT $600 BILLION IN CONTRACTS FOR A YEAR, GUESS WHY? , GUESS WHAT? WHEN I AM PRESIDENT IT WILL GO TO KNOW OUTFIT THAT DOES NOT MAKE IT IN AMERICA AND SELL IT IN AMERICA. I MEAN IT. INFRASTRUCTURE, BUILDING ROADS, AIRPORTS, CLEAN ENERGY. WEATHERIZING 2 MILLION HOMES. CREATING AT LEAST A MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS, MAKING THE CLIMATE SAFER, SAVING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL. WE'LL DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE BY CREATING MILLIONS OF UNION JOBS. WE WILL FIGHT BACK STRONGER, THE MORE FREQUENT WILDFIRES. AND BY THE WAY. DID YOU HEAR WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID ABOUT HURRICANES THIS SUMMER? HE WAS TOLD HOW THEY WERE COMING ACROSS THE WARM WATER IN THE ATLANTIC AND THE CLOSER THEY GET TO THE SHORE THE WORST THEY GET. THAT'S THE WORST THEY GET , THE WORSE THEY GET. HE SAID MAYBE WE SHOULD DROP AN ATOMIC BOMB ON THEM. BLESS ME, FATHER, FOR I HAVE SENT. , FOR I HAVE SINNED. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE ANOTHER $100 BILLION IN LOW-INTEREST LOANS AVAILABLE FOR THESE BUSINESSES, CREATING JOB, INCREASING ECONOMIC GROWTH, INCREASING INCOMES. A $15 MINIMUM WAGE. A $15 MINIMUM WAGE FOR OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WE NOT JUST WENT TO PRAISE YOU. WE ARE GOING TO PAY YOU WITH A GOOD WAGE AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE STRONG BENEFIT. WE WILL BUILD THE , WE WILL CREATE SUBSIDIES TO INCREASE PLANS THAT WILL LOWER DEDUCTIBLES. IT IS A PLAN THAT WILL/, SLASH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. IF IN FACT MEDICARE IS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE FOR ALL THE DRUGS THEY BUY AND SAY, YOU WILL NOT SELL THEM UNLESS THEY PAY THE PRICE THEY ARE SUGGESTING, THAT WOULD DROP BY 60% THE COST OF DRUGS. WE WILL ALSO MAKE HIGH-QUALITY CHILD CARE ACCESSIBLE AND WORK WITH STATES TO ENSURE THAT EVERY THREE AND FOUR-YEAR-OLD WILL GET ACCESS TO A HIGH-QUALITY PRESCHOOL, NOT DAYCARE. WE WILL ENSURE THAT LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WILL NEVER HAVE TO SPEND MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. IF WE WANT TO REWARD WORK ON THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF FAMILIES CARING FOR A CHILD OR AN AGING LOVED ONE. FOR THE PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS OUT THERE, OFTEN WOMEN, WOMEN OF COLOR, IMMIGRANTS, TOO OFTEN UNDERPAID, UNDER SEEN, UNDERVALUED. THAT IS WHY MY PLAN WILL ELEVATE THE COMPENSATION FOR CAREGIVERS AND WE WILL TRIPLE THE FUNDING FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS LIKE THE ONE BEHIND ME. WE WILL MAKE FOUR YEARS OF PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE AND UNIVERSITY TUITION FREE FOR ANY FAMILY THAT MAKES LESS THAN $125,000 A YEAR. WE WILL MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE FOR AMERICA'S IT QUALIFY. AND IF YOU ARE BUYING YOUR FIRST HOME, WE WILL PROVIDE A 15 THOUSAND DOLLARS TAX CREDIT TO HELP YOU GET THERE. WE WILL INCREASE BENEFITS FOR MILLIONS OF SENIORS. GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM. WE PAY FOR ALL THIS AND WE GROW THE ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CAN ONLY SEE THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. HE THINKS WALL STREET BUILT THIS COUNTRY. I SEE THE WORLD FROM SCRANTON. COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES YOU LIVE IN. THE MEASURE OF ECONOMIC ACCESS IS FAMILIES TALKING ABOUT THIS AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE, BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND THEY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. HOW MANY TIMES HAS SOMEONE , I KNOW THIS TIRES ARE BALD. WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE WE CAN CONTINUE TO BORROW FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THOSE ARE THE DISCUSSIONS THAT TOOK PLACE AROUND MY TABLE. IF WERE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, WE'VE GOT TO COME TOGETHER . I MADE A SPEECH AND I THOUGHT REALLY HARD ABOUT IT IN GETTYSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA AT THE BATTLEFIELD LAST WEEK. I SAID AT THE TIME WE ARE FACING A CRISIS NOT UNLIKE WE DID OVER GETTYSBURG. I SAID I AM RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT, BUT I AM GOING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I AM GOING TO WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. AFTER ALL THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH, AFTER ALL THE YEARS WE STOOD AS A BEACON OF LIGHT TO THE WORLD WE CANNOT BE HERE AND NOW AND 2020, WE CANNOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE TO PERISH FROM THIS EARTH. FOLKS, WE HAVE IT IN OUR HANDS AND I MEAN THIS , WE HAVE THE ULTIMATE POWER. WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE POWER IN A DEMOCRACY? THE POWER TO VOTE. IN NEVADA, THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS VOTE EARLY AND RETURN YOUR BALLOT QUICKLY. BALLOTS IN CLARK COUNTY WERE MAILED TWO DAYS AGO. YOU CAN RETURN YOUR BALLOT BY MAIL. YOU CAN DROP IT OFF WITH A DROPBOX. JUST MAKE A PLAN. SERIOUSLY. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM/NV. MAKE A PLAN. MAKE SURE YOUR VOICE IS HEARD. WE CAN BE BETTER WE CAN BE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN BRING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER AGAIN WITH HIM GONE. FOLKS, LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING OR HAS NEVER EVER, EVER BEEN ANYTHING THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHEN WE HAVE DONE IT TOGETHER. NEVER, NEVER. FOLKS, LET'S STAND UP AND TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY NOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.",

         "HELLO, HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN. I'M TRYING TO GET A JOB WITH CHRIS. HE IS MR. PRESIDENT. HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE UNION. MR. PRESIDENT, I WAS KIDDING HIM. YOU KNOW, THE HARDEST THING, ONLY THING HARDER THAN BEING PRESIDENT OF A UNION IS BEING THE MAYOR OF A BEAUTIFUL CITY. FOLKS, THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE TODAY. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WE EVEN HAVE AN ASTRONAUT IN OUR HOUSE AND I TELL YOU WHAT, THAT'S PRETTY COOL. LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK CHRIS AND THE MAYOR FOR BEING HERE, AND ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOU KNOW, THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES. OVER 200,000 AMERICANS HAVE PASSED AWAY. OVER 200,000, AND THE NUMBER IS STILL RISING. THE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES IS BAD ACROSS THE BOARD, BUT PARTICULARLY BAD FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. ALMOST FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY, THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO CATCH THE DISEASE, COVID, AND WHEN IT'S CAUGHT, TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE AS WHITE AMERICANS. IT'S SORT OF EMBLEMATIC OF THE INEQUALITY THAT EXISTS AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXIST. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTERS TO ME, IS IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. YOU HAVE 30 MILLION PEOPLE ON UNEMPLOYMENT, YOU HAVE 20 MILLION PEOPLE FIGURING WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN PAY THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENT THIS MONTH, AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO OR NOT DO AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT, AND YOU'VE GOT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THROWN OUT IN THE STREET BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY THEIR RENT. ALTHOUGH THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN A REPRIEVE FOR THREE MONTHS, BUT THEY HAVE TO PAY DOUBLE THE NEXT THREE MONTHS WHEN IT COMES AROUND. HOW ARE PEOPLE GOING TO DO THAT? AND THE WAY, IN FACT, THE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE AND THE SENATE STEPPED UP AND PASSED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO HELP PEOPLE GET THROUGH THE PROCESS, INCLUDING KEEPING BUSINESSES OPEN AND THE LIKE. WELL, GUESS WHAT? THEY INSISTED THERE BEING A THING CALLED AN INSPECTOR GENERAL, SOMEBODY WATCHING WHERE EVERY DOLLAR WENT. THE FIRST THING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DID IS FIRE THAT INSPECTOR GENERAL. THERE IS NO INSPECTOR. HE'S FIRED. FIRED. AND SO YOU'VE GOT ONLY 40% OF THE MONEY INTENDED FOR SMALL BUSINESSES GOING TO SMALL BUSINESSES. ONLY 40% OF IT. 60% HAS GONE TO THE MAR-A-LAGO CROWD. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE FIND OURSELVES IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR PEOPLE IS VERY MUCH IN DOUBT, ALTHOUGH THE HOUSE JUST PASSED A PACKAGE TODAY. MY GENERIC POINT IS, THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLUMBIA POINTED OUT, THAT IF IN FACT THE PRESIDENT HAD ACTED, EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW NOW HE KNEW EXACTLY HOW BAD THE PANDEMIC WAS BACK IN FEBRUARY , HE IS ON TAPE WITH BOB WOODWARD SAYING HE KNEW HOW BAD IT WAS AND HE DIDN'T SAY A THING. HE DIDN'T SAY A THING. IF HE HAD SPOKEN, AS I SAID, THEY SAID AT COLUMBIA, ONE WEEK EARLIER, 37,000 MORE PEOPLE BE ALIVE TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER INFLUX OF CASES, JUST BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY, IT'S EXPECTED THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DEPENDING ON WHICH ESTIMATE YOU , TAKE, BETWEEN 138000 AND 178,000 MORE DEATHS. AND IF PEOPLE JUST DO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE, AND WHEN YOU'RE AT A SOCIAL DISTANCE, AS I AM, YOU CAN TAKE A MASK OFF, BUT WEAR A MASK. THEY ESTIMATE THAT WOULD SAVE ABOUT CLOSE TO 90,000 PEOPLE. 89,000, AND SO IT'S ABOUT BEING RESPONSIBLE. IT'S ABOUT BEING RESPONSIBLE. AND WE'RE NOT BEING VERY RESPONSIBLE. BUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS THAT WE HAVE TO BREAK A CYCLE. THE CYCLE THAT EXISTS IS THAT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY BY AND LARGE FINDS ITSELF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ECONOMIC HEAP, BUSINESSES AND OTHERS, WHEN THINGS ARE GOOD. WHEN THINGS GET BAD, THEY'RE THE FIRST ONES IN THE HOLE. AND WHEN THINGS GET BETTER, THEY'RE THE LAST ONES OUT. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT NEEDS SIGNIFICANT REPAIR. AND WE'RE JUST ONLY BEGINNING, SLIGHTLY, TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS NOW. AND THIRDLY, IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS PERSON, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, EVERY PERSON OUT THERE WANTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT FOR THEIR FAMILY. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, 'EVERYBODY'S ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY.' HE SAID 'JOEY, A JOB IS ABOUT A , LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. BEING ABLE TO HOLD YOUR HEAD UP. BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, 'HONEY, EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY.' FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, THEY CAN'T SAY THAT. THAT'S NOT ABLE TO BE DONE. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT TODAY, IS HOW DO WE BUILD WEALTH? ULTIMATELY, ULTIMATELY THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY ONLY IS GOING TO HAVE ITS PLACE EQUAL TO EVERYONE ELSE WHEN THEY'RE IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO BUILD WEALTH, BE ABLE TO BUILD WEALTH. AND THAT GOES FOR EVERYTHING FROM ACCESS TO BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE A HOME, ACCESS TO JOBS, ACCESS TO JUST BEING ABLE TO HAVE AN EVEN SHOT. THAT'S WHAT I HOPE WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT TODAY. IT GOES TO EDUCATION, AS WELL AS ACCESS TO EDUCATION, ACCESS BEYOND. EVERYTHING FROM A LOT OF POOR WHITES AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS, POOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS LIVE IN TITLE I DISTRICTS, MEANING THAT THEY LIVE IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE VERY LOW TAX BASE. RIGHT NOW WE SPEND $15 BILLION A YEAR TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT LOW TAX BASE. I INCREASED THAT TO $45 BILLION. BUT IT DOESN'T KEEP TEACHERS IN SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE'RE SHORT TEACHERS SIGNIFICANTLY. 125,000 TEACHERS SHORT RIGHT NOW. BE OVER HALF A MILLION BY 2023. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE FIND OURSELVES IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE USED TO HAVE IN OUR SCHOOLS, IN THE OLD DAYS, USED TO HAVE 1 , NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY, WE VIRTUALLY HAVE NO SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND SO TEACHERS COME IN TO SCHOOL AND THEY'RE EXPECTED TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. WELL, THERE'S ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST FOR EVERY 1,507 KIDS IN SCHOOL. IT SHOULD BE CLOSER TO ONE TO 500. WE CAN DO THAT BY INCREASING THE MONEY I JUST TALKED ABOUT FROM 15 TO 45. AND SEND EVERY SINGLE CHILD THAT'S THREE YEARS OLD, FOUR YEARS OLD, AND FIVE YEARS OLD, NOT TO DAYCARE, BUT TO SCHOOL. ALL THE STUDIES OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITIES IN THIS STATE AND EVERY OTHER HAVE POINTED OUT IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, THAT'LL INCREASE BY 58% THEIR CHANCES OF GOING ALL THE WAY THROUGH SCHOOL, NO MATTER WHAT THE ZIP CODE THEY COME FROM, NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE, AND BE ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT GETTING THEMSELVES IN TROUBLE. THEN WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT, I THINK A BIG ISSUE HERE IS ACCESS TO APPRENTICESHIPS AND ACCESS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND COLLEGE, AND THE STUDENT DEBT REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE THERE. HOPE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BASICALLY ONE BIG, IMPORTANT THING, HOW DO WE CHANGE THE DYNAMIC? THIS IS A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY. AS BAD AS THINGS HAVE GOTTEN, THE BLINDERS HAVE SORT OF BEEN TAKEN OFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOW. THEY LOOK OUT THERE AND WE HAVE A PANDEMIC, UNEMPLOYMENT, RACE RELATIONS HAVE JUST BEEN DRAWN INTO FOCUS EVERYTHING FROM , POLICE BRUTALITY TO LACK OF ACCESS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALL OF A SUDDEN, AVERAGE PEOPLE HAVE GONE, 'MY LORD. HOLY MACKEREL. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THIS BAD.' A LOT OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW. A LOT DID. BUT A LOT DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THIS BAD. WELL, I WON'T GO INTO IT. I'M TALKING TOO MUCH NOW IN MY OPENING STATEMENT, BUT HERE'S THE POINT. THE POINT IS, I BELIEVE WE HAVE A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY, A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE SYSTEMIC RACISM AND THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS THAT EXIST IN OUR SYSTEM. I THINK WE HAVE TO DO IT, BUT ONLY ONE WAY TO DO IT. WE'VE GOT TO SHOW UP AND VOTE. BUT I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE TURNED OFF. I BELIEVE NO MATTER WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES TO TRY TO MAKE IT HARD TO VOTE FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST PEOPLE OF COLOR, BUT EVERYONE, NO MATTER WHAT, I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN VIRGINIA, EARLY VOTING. THEY HAVE FOUR-HOUR LINES IN THE FIRST DAY, AND WE'RE OVER 40 DAYS OUT. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SHOW UP AND VOTE. THEY WILL NOT BE DISSUADED. SO THAT'S WHY I'M OPTIMISTIC. I WAS ASKED BY ONE OF THE FOREIGN LEADERS WHEN I WAS OVERSEAS, WHEN I WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT, THEY SAID, 'CAN YOU DEFINE AMERICA FOR ME?' I SAID, 'YES, I CAN, IN ONE WORD. POSSIBILITIES. POSSIBILITIES.' WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT BELIEVES ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. I THINK WE GOT A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY IN THE YEAR 2020 TO MAKE THESE CHANGES. WITH THAT, AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, I'M GOING TO HUSH UP AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU ALL HAVE. I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY HERE.",

TRUMP TAX CUTS AND ENORMOUS GIVEAWAYS TO THE TOP 1/10 OF 1%. IT'S TIME WE START TO REWARD WORK OVER WEALTH. WE NEED TO BIG , BOLD. THE TAX LOOPHOLES BUILT IN THAT HAVE NO SOCIAL REDEEMING VALUE. AND PUT THAT MONEY TO GOOD USE. HEALTH CARE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE NEED TO SAVE AND BUILD UPON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, NOT SAID IT, JETTISON IT. 20 MILLION PEOPLE ARE COVERED THAT WERE NOT BEFORE. 140 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. I AM , I WAS PROUD EVERY DAY TO SERVE WITH BARACK OBAMA BUT LET ME TELL YOU, NEVER PROUDER THAN HE GOT DONE WHAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO DO. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO CREATE THE JOBS. UNDER MY PLAN, WHETHER YOU'RE COVERED BY EMPLOYER ON YOUR OWN OR NOT AT ALL YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FLY INTO A PUBLIC HEALTH CARE OPTION LIKE MEDICARE. AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE IT AND IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE ENROLLED IN THAT. WE CAN GUARANTEE THAT THE POOR , ARE IN FACT COVERED BECAUSE THEY CAN BE, AND IT IS WITHIN OUR INTEREST IN IT WILL SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, EDUCATION. 12 YEARS ARE NO LONGER ENOUGH FOR THE 12 FOR CENTURY OF EDUCATION. FOLKS, THAT IS WHY WANTED TRIPLE TITLE I FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. AND, BY THE WAY, WE CAN AFFORD TO DO THIS. $15 TO $45 BILLION, WE NEED UNIVERSAL PRE-K WE NEED TO RAISE TEACHERS PAY AND WE NEED TO FULLY FUND SPECIAL EDUCATION' NUMBER OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST, GUIDANCE COUNSELORS AND NURSES BECAUSE TEACHERS CANNOT DO IT ALL ON THEIR OWN. AND, OLKFOLKS, WE CAN EASILY AFFORD FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CUTTING IN HALF THE COST OF FOUR YEAR COLLEGES FOR EVERYONE QUALIFIED TO GET IN AND, WE HAVE TO REDUCE THE STUDENT DEBT WHICH I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO GO INTO NOW BUT WE WILL. CHAPTER. I, CHILDCARE. I KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE A SINGLE PARENT. I WAS ONE FOR FIVE YEARS. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE FOR PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE HELP THAT I HAD. I THINK WE SHOULD PROVIDE AN $8,000 TAX CREDIT FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAS A CHILD THAT NEEDS CHILDCARE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, CLIMATE CHANGE. WE HAVE TO RESTORE WHAT BARACK OBAMA AND I DID IN TERMS OF FUEL ECONOMY AND DOUBLING THE FUEL ECONOMY AS WELL AS COAL FIRED PLANTS. WE CAN DOUBLE OUR SHORES , WIND ENERGY BY 2030 PROVIDING $400 BILLION IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS FOR CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION. MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH AS WE SPENT GOING TO THE MOON. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ALSO HAVE TO HOLD A LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE. YOU SAW THE HEADLINES TODAY'S PAPER. IT SAID, SOUTH CAROLINA $2 BILLION PIPES LIKE TISSUE PAPER THREATENING PUBLIC HEALTH. IT IS ON EXCEPT , UNACCEPTABLE THAT THAT OCCURRED. IT IS NOT JUST IN SOUTH CAROLINA. IT IS AROUND AMERICA. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THERE IT TOO MEET PEOPLE IN PRISON AND TOO MANY BLACK MEN AND BLACK WOMEN IN PRISON. IN OUR ADMINISTRATION WE STARTED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND REFORM PRISONS BY 38,000 PEOPLE CAME OUT. WE PASSED THE SUPPORT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND INITIATIVES TO BREAK THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE BUT WE NEED TO PASS BOBBY SCOTT FROM VIRGINIA'S SAFE JUSTICE ACT. I GOT TO ADD A FEW THINGS. NO MORE MANDATORY MINIMUMS. PERIOD. AND PRIVATE PRISONS WHICH WE DID IN OUR BILL. PERIOD. FUND MY DRUG COURTS, TO ABOUT $1 BILLION THE YEAR. NO ONE SHOULD BE GOING TO JAIL BECAUSE THEY ARE ADDICTED. THEY SHOULD BE GOING INTO REHABILITATION, NOT TO JAIL. BAIL REFORM. IS BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY SHOULD NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD LANGUISH IN JAIL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NO TUNABLES , NO JUVENILE AS AN ADULT PRISON AND MANDATORY TREATMENT IN JAIL FOR PEOPLE WHO ALSO SUFFER FROM ADDICTION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA AND AUTOMATICALLY EXPUNGE RECORDS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED.

AUTOMATIC RESTORATION OF RIGHTS, MEANING NOT ONLY YOU CAN VOTE BUT YOU QUALIFY FOR EVERY PROGRAM INCLUDING PELL GRANTS TO GET YOUR EDUCATION. IT MAKES NO SENSE. LOOK, FOLKS, WE HAVE TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HARNESS THIS. WE ARE IN A COUPLE OF MAJOR CHANGES AND CANCER, DIABETES AND ALZHEIMER'S. WE CAN DO THIS BY DOUBLING NIH'S BUDGET AND SET UP A NEW PROJECT THAT , LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TO COME UP WITH THE WHOLE INTERNET, PROVIDE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR BASIC RESEARCH. HEALTHCARE, FOCUS ON RESEARCH AND TAKE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON SOLVING PROBLEMS THAT IS WITHIN OUR REACH LIKE THAT CANCER INITIATIVE AND THE MOONSHOT. LOOK, I GBBEAT THE NRA BEFORE. WE OUGHT TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS AND MAGAZINES, AND, BY THE WAY, NEW TECHNOLOGY, YOU CANNOT ACQUIRE A GUN UNLESS YO UHAVE BIOMETRIC PRINT ON IT. NO PROBLEM IN TERMS OF SECOND AMENDMENT AND YOU HAVE TO PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK WHICH I PUT INTO LAW AS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BRADY AMENDMENT. EVERYBODY, FOLKS, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CAN FUNDAMENTALLY RESHAPE OUR LIVES. I'M NEVER MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO PICK OUR HEADS UP. I REMEMBER THE PHRASE FROM JOHN KENNEDY GOING TO THE MOON, BECAUSE WE ARE UNWILLING TO POSTPONE. I'M NOT WILLING TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER THE POTENTIAL OF THIS NATION. IT IS TOTALLY IN OUR POWER TO CHANGE IT. GOD BLESS YOU, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, APPRECIATE IT.",

         "Thank you, everybody. (Applause.) That's a group. Some group. Thank you very much. Thank you. That's fantastic. A lot of power in this room. Wow. A lot of power. Thank you, Kevin, for your friendship and for your devotion to our nation. I'm delighted to be here with so many terrific Republican members of Congress. You really are terrific people. I especially want to thank our amazing leadership team: Republican Whip, and one of the bravest men I know, Steve Scalise. Steve, thank you very much. (Applause.) Conference Chair Liz Cheney. (Applause.) Thank you, Liz. NRCC Chair Tom Emmer. Tom. (Applause.) Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Tom. And Chief Deputy Whip Drew Ferguson. Great job. (Applause.) Thank you, Drew. Great job. I also want to proudly welcome our newest Republican congressmen , two people that fought a big fight for the last number of months, and they're winners. They reacted so incredibly under pressure. The whole world was watching. A lot of people were hoping for the opposite outcome, but many more people were hoping for the outcome that we had. A man who wasn't expected necessarily to win, and then he got in gear and he was brutal and brilliant, and he did a great job. Now, soon to be, and now Congressman Dan Bishop , for many years. Thank you, Dan. (Applause.) Dan, thank you. What a great job. (Applause.) What a great job, Dan. And another man who fought so hard and he was supposed to win by a little tiny bit, a couple of points, and he won by a lot of points. That was a big victory, and I want to just congratulate you. Greg Murphy is going to be with you folks for a long time. (Applause.) These two people are special people. North Carolina , thank you, North Carolina. (Applause.) They were some crowds that turned out. They turned out, and they turned out like people never expected. And they were , that was just a great evening of television. I wouldn't say the fake news was too happy with the outcome, but that's okay. That's okay. We did it. And we worked together as a team, and it was very inspirational for a lot of people to watch. Everyone here tonight has a critical role to play at the vital crossroads of our nation. Democrats in Congress have embraced an extreme, destructive, and dangerous agenda: radical socialism and open borders. Democrats are determined to replicate the most catastrophic failures of world history right here in the United States. They've never learned. They haven't watched. Each of you in the House Republican Conference is on the frontlines defending American freedom, American security, American prosperity, and the American way of life. You're the ones , you're doing the defense. Hundreds of millions of our fellow citizens are counting on us, and, so help us God, we will never, ever let them down. (Applause.) Together, we're going to fight historic battles, and we have historic battles ahead of us. Going to make our country even greater. And we're going to win overwhelming victories for the American people. The spirit that we have in the Republican Party, I don't believe, has ever been this high. Over the past two and a half years, we've already delivered unprecedented progress for citizens of every background and every walk of life. Now we must go directly to the American people to share the story of what we have achieved and to explain our bold vision for the future. Working with Republicans in Congress, we slashed 30,000 pages of regulations from the Federal Register. (Applause.) And that is an all-time record, and we did that in a lot less years. That's an all-time record, no matter how long a President was there. We saved an average American household $3,000. Earlier today, my administration formally repealed the horrible, dangerous, anti-everything Waters of the United States rule. (Applause.) Thank you, Louie. Thank you, Louie. I would say the only thing that had going for it that was good was the title. (Laughter.) That was , I said, 'I'm the only one that would sign this.' But it was a good thing we did. Right, Louie? It was a good thing we did. Government will no longer try to micromanage every rain puddle and every drainage ditch on private land. They took your land away from you. Together, we enacted the VA Accountability Act, so that anyone who mistreats or abuses our great veterans can be promptly fired. (Applause.) There was a time you couldn't fire anyone, no matter how they treated our veterans, whether they stole or they were sadists. And we had some of them too. You couldn't fire them, and now we can do it very, very quickly and easily. They don't treat our veterans well. We get them out. Since then, we've removed more than 7,600 employees who failed to give our vets the care they so richly deserve. We're also very proud to tell you that the Veterans Choice, which is something special , so special; they've been trying to get it for decades and decades , Choice , so that more veterans have the right to see a private doctor, if they have to wait on line, instead of waiting for two weeks or three weeks or five weeks, or numbers that you wouldn't even believe. Think of it. You're sick, you're not feeling well, and they tell you, 'Come back in four weeks.' Now you go outside, you go to a local doctor of your choice, by the way , unlike somebody else, where they said, 'You can have your doctor and you can have your plan' 28 times. That didn't work out too well. (Laughter.) You go out and you see a doctor of your choice. We pay the bill. And it's been an incredible thing. I'll tell you, what's happening at the VA has been really something special. If you look and , you just see it. All you used to see and read about is how bad the VA was run, how horrible it was. And you don't hear those stories anymore. Now, you know, what we'll go is these people will run out and they'll start trying to find somebody. 'Who is unhappy?' Thousands and hundreds of thousands of people? 'Who's unhappy? Please call us immediately.' And that's the problem. But I will tell you, people are really happy. What we've done there is incredible. We achieved record funding to restore the awesome might of the American military: $700 billion last year; $716 billion this year; and now, just approved , thank you very much , $738 billion next year. (Applause.) More money, by far, than ever before. And remember, that's all money; it's built in the USA. We build it right here. America, I will tell you, is respected again. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. We have the greatest equipment. We have people with spirit like they haven't had. But we now have the greatest equipment. When I came in two and a half years ago, our equipment was old and tired. Our ammunition was low. Our planes didn't fly well. Many of them didn't fly at all. Now we have beautiful, new planes and jets and fighter jets and bombers. And we have everything. And hopefully we don't have to use them too much, and maybe we don't have to use them at all. But we have the greatest military we've ever had. (Applause.) And, together, so importantly, we ended the last administration's heartless war on American energy. For all of the folks in Texas , we got a lot of you tonight , you're very happy. And plenty of other places. But you're very happy. (Applause.) The United States is now the number one energy producer anywhere in the world, by far. (Applause.) For the first time in more than 60 years , this just happened , we are now a net exporter of American natural gas. (Applause.) And we're ending decades of foreign energy reliance to unleash the blessings of American energy independence. We are really , if you look at what's going on in certain countries in the Middle East, and you look at the Straits, and you see the ships, and they're being taken and they're being , not too often, by the way, because, frankly, Iran is a much different country than it was two and a half years ago. But they were saying, 'We don't see any American ships.' There are no Amer- , number one, they wouldn't take them. They better not take them. And number two, we don't have too many there. We used to be flooded. We used to get everything there. And now it's a whole different story. We're very energy-independent. We've invested billions of dollars to combat the opioid crisis and those struggling with addiction to find access to treatment, education, and employment. A tremendous problem. We've had tremendous success with opioid. Not that it goes away, but we're looking very strongly for something that can really take away the pain , just take away the pain without being addictive. And we're getting very close. This is a brutal , people go into the hospital for a week, and they come out drug addicts. They come out addicted. It's a terrible thing. But we're working very hard, and we're getting very close, finding a pain killer that's not addictive. For the first time in three decades, drug overdose deaths have declined. Think of that. Over 30 years. (Applause.) First time. Thanks to the entire Republican team in Congress, we passed the biggest tax cut and reform in American history. (Applause.) And we're now working on a middle tax. We're working on a tax cut for the middle-income people. That is going to be very, very inspirational. It's going to be something that I think it's what everyone is really looking for. And we'll be announcing it sometime in the next year. But it'll be a very, very substantial tax cut for middle-income folks who work so hard. And we look forward to that. We're going to work on it all together. And you see what the other tax cut has done. And, frankly, I'm not sure, but I would say that the regulation cuts , those massive cuts in regulation , still have plenty of regulation , but those massive cuts probably equal the tax cuts in terms of jobs and in terms of businesses. The combination of everything really worked because we probably have, right now, the strongest economy in the history of our nation. (Applause.) And where the media is trying to , begging. Oh, they want a recession so badly. Oh. (Laughter.) The word. And every time they go after us, you notice the market goes up? It's the craziest thing. You're going to have to explain this one to me. But we're doing great. We're very close to having another stock market record. It went up again today. And we had , I think it's over 100 records. In other words, days where the stock market hit, in the history of our country , all-time highs. I think it's over 100. I'll get the exact number, but it is really something. And we are very close. And about three weeks ago, if you listened, it was like 'doom and gloom.' I don't think they believed it, but that's okay. I will tell you, we're doing very well with China, because China would like to do something. We're taking in billions and billions of tariffs. And they're eating the cost. This is not being borne very much by us. They're eating the costs. But we're taking in billions and billions. Money flowing in. We've never taken in 10 cents from China. And they want to do something because their supply lines, their supply chains, are being broken like toys. And people are leaving, and people are , millions of jobs in China are being lost. And we don't want that, but we want a fair deal. We lowered our business tax from one of the highest in the world to one of the most competitive. Since that law was passed, nearly $1 trillion have returned to our shores. One trillion dollars. It was part of what we did. We doubled the child tax credit. (Applause.) Thank you to a number of people for that, but especially Ivanka Trump. That was so important to her to make sure that she understood. (Applause.) Jared is here, but she understood exactly what that meant. She worked so hard on that. We created Opportunity Zones to revitalize distressed communities. Tim Scott was fantastic, and so many other senators. They worked with us so hard on that. But Tim Scott in particular really worked hard. South Carolina. And we thanked him. But they are , they are doing numbers that nobody believed possible, the Opportunity Zones. So much money is going to into areas where it would never seen , see money, and it hasn't seen it in a long time. We eliminated Obamacare's cruel and unpopular individual mandate. (Applause.) Since our election in 2016, we've created more than 6 million new jobs, including over 1 million manufacturing, energy, and construction jobs. Remember when President Obama said, 'No, no, forget the manufacturing; not going to happen'? Well, we have almost 600,000, just in terms of manufacturing jobs. And nobody thought that was possible. And, frankly, as soon as we get the trade stuff, perfect , just the way we want it; we'll only sign it when it's good, really good. Wait until you see what happens with this economy. We are ready to really rock it even more. We've done very well. You go from Election Night, the day after , take November 9th , and you look at the numbers on stock markets, over 50 percent; 401k(s) are through the roof. People come up to me all the time: 'Thank you, sir. My 401(k) is up 72 percent.' It's up , whatever it may be. Numbers that they've never had before. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. And this is when we're fighting people on trade, when we have this great military, and we defend countries that are immensely wealthy and they don't help us out, they don't pay us for almost anything. And we're talking to those countries. They're our friends, they're our allies. Sometimes our allies treat us worse than anybody else. But we can't let that happen, and they don't want to let that happen. It just takes a little getting used to, because nobody has ever asked them. 'Look, we're defending your country, you're rich as can be. You got to help us out. You got to pay a little bit.' And they go, 'No, no.' I say, 'No, no, no, King. You got to pay.' 'No, no, Mr. President.' 'Mr. Prime Minister, you go to pay. You got to pay.' And the answer is, 'But, uh, nobody has ever asked us to do that before.' I said, 'That's why I'm different. That's why I'm different. I'm asking you to do it.' (Applause.) I always say, 'You know, tell me, why are we defending you for free?' Or 'Why are we defending you for a tiny fraction of what it costs? And then you take advantage of the United States for many years, on trade?' So we get killed with trade, we get killed with defending your nation. 'Tell me, Mr. President, tell me, Mr. Prime Minister, tell me, King or Queen, why are we protecting your country and you take advantage, really, of us on trade?' And they go, 'But nobody has ever asked me that question before.' I said, 'Tell me why.' They can't think of an answer. The only thing they say all the time , because it has always been that way , I said, 'Well, it's not going to be that way any longer. You got to pay.' (Applause.) It's true. Not going to be that way any longer. Last month alone, nearly 600,000 people joined our workforce. For the first time ever, most new hires are minorities and women. Nobody knows that because the media doesn't get that across. (Applause.) More than 7 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. And we now have a , 13 straight months of wage gains of at least 3 percent. (Applause.) Think of that. Remember, during the campaign, I used to say that people would go back 21 years , that was when I was running , 21 years. And they made more money 21 years ago than they were making two and a half years ago. They were making more money. And I said, 'Isn't that terrible?' And they had two jobs and even three jobs, and they made more money 21 years before. Not anymore. African American and Hispanic American unemployment have reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country. (Applause.) I wonder if that will be mentioned tonight during the debate. (Laughter.) I don't know, I have a feeling. What do you think, Steve? I don't think so. Kevin, you think they'll be talking about that? I don't think so. That's a good debate point. As they hit me left and right, I'll say, African American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been. And just leave the stage, and say, 'Thank you very much. Good luck.' (Laughter and applause.) But another good one is that African American and Hispanic American poverty rates have also reached the all-time, in our history, record lows. I mean, how do you lose this debate? (Applause.) How do you lose the debate? That's a tough one to beat also. Our Pledge to the American Worker has already secured commitments for 13 million employment and training opportunities for American citizens. We have these great companies , greatest companies in the world , and they're training people. Government can't really train them. We're training people through these incredible programs where we're going to these unbelievable , Walmart, as an example, and so many others. We're going to the companies, and they're taking people and training them. We could never train them for that. Nobody can train them for that; only the company itself. Thirteen million people, and it's something beautiful to see. We gather tonight to celebrate these extraordinary gains. We've done things that I don't think any administration has even come close in the first two and a half years. We have done things that very, very few have even thought about doing. But we also meet to prepare for the coming fight, because the traditions and beliefs that have made the American Dream possible are under attack like never before. You've never seen anything like it; I've never seen anything like it. House Democrats are pursuing the most radical far-left program ever put forward in that historic chamber. It's the Democrats and it's the media. We're fighting two battles. The Democrats and the media, it's as if they're one. Because they are one. They're working together. They're colluding. (Laughter.) And they're obstructing. (Applause.) With the grim specter of socialism descending on the Democrat Party, it's up to all of us to ensure the survival of American liberty. We have a big task. We have a very big task. Don't forget, the people say, 'Oh, you're going to beat this one or that one,' and 'they're so far left.' It's very hard to beat a socialist when you have a very wealthy country. We have a very wealthy country. And when they say, 'We're going to give away your healthcare. We're going to do free education. We're going to cut student loan debt down to nothing , $1.6 trillion out the window. We're going to do this, we're going to do that.' Everything is given away. And then they say, 'Oh, we don't have to raise your taxes too much.' If you paid five times what people are paying right now, you wouldn't come close. And, you know, we're working very hard on a place called Venezuela. Fifteen years ago, it was one of the wealthiest countries in the world. And, today, they don't have food. They don't have water. They don't have anything. They don't have anything. We're sending things to help them , we have to , on a humanitarian basis. And we're working with Colombia and other nations to help the people that have been able to essentially escape. But that was socialism. And look what happened to them in a short period of time. On issue after issue, Americans must choose between two fundamentally different visions that will define our nation for many generations to come. More than 130 Democrats in Congress have signed up for the Bernie Sanders total government takeover of healthcare , (laughter) , Crazy Bernie; he is a crazy guy , which would dramatically raise middle-class taxes, eliminate private health insurance for 180 million Americans, and destroy Medicare forever. Republicans will always protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and they paid for it. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. (Applause.) Two hundred and twenty-eight House Democrats voted to put America back into the disastrous Paris Climate Accord. How's that working out for Paris? How's that one working out for France? The yellow vests. They didn't like all that money being sent to people that they never heard of, the country from which they came. And it hasn't been working out well. But that would have been a disaster for us. It would have cost us a tremendous fortune. They were going to take away our wealth. They were going to say we can't do certain businesses. We can't take the oil and gas. We can't do anything. This would have been one of the great travesties. And you know, incredibly, that and the Clean Waters Act, which didn't give you clean waters. By the way, today, we have the cleanest air, we have the cleanest water that we've ever had in the history of our country. Right, Louie? (Applause.) And just for the press , because they'll get me on that one, I'm thinking , let's say, the history of our country over the last 25 years. You know, I would say that the first few years, they probably had cleaner air and cleaner water because there was nobody here. (Laughter.) So I have to be very accurate. But they'll put it on anyway. They won't put , right, Louie? They won't put the second part on. They won't put the explanation on. But we do. We have clean air; we have clean water. The Paris Accord would do nothing to improve our environment. It would only punish our country while foreign polluters operate with impunity. Isn't it incredible? You look at China, you look at India, you look at Russia, you look at so many other places, their smokestacks are pouring out. Everything is pouring out. And I want to be clean. And we're going to be clean. But isn't it, sort of, na�ve? And then they talk about plastic straws. I say, 'What about the plate? What about the wrapper that's made out of a much tougher plastic? What about all the other plastic?' 'Well, we haven't gotten to that. Just straws. That's the only thing we're worried about.' Someday, you'll explain that to me, Louie. I'm sure you , you're a big environmentalist. Can you explain the straw? No, I don't think so. Nobody else can either. By the way, you know who else can't? They can't. (Laughter.) They can't explain it. We did a couple of things. We're working on cars because for a virtually just insignificant amount of energy, we're going to be able to produce cars that are substantially , by $3,500 or so , cheaper, less expensive, that are much, much safer , (applause) , because they're heavier, they're stronger. They're not made out of papier-m�ch�. (Laughter.) They're heavier, stronger, and they'll cost a lot less money. And you saw that. The lightbulb. People said, 'What's with the lightbulb?' I said, 'Here's the story ' And I looked at it , the bulb that we're being forced to use , number one, to me, most importantly, the light is no good. I always look orange. (Laughter and applause.) And so do you. The light is the worst. But number two, it's many times more expensive than that old incandescent bulb that worked very well. And very importantly , I don't know if you know this , they have warnings. If it breaks, it's considered a hazardous waste site. It's gasses inside. And read what they say: 'If it breaks, bring it to your local whatever. Have it wrapped, have it this.' What are we doing? What are we doing? And I said to one of the top people today, 'Well, they break a lot. Don't they?' 'Yes, sir.' 'What do they do?' 'They just throw them away. They don't care.' But they call it 'hazardous waste.' But it's many times more expensive. And the light is not as good. I mean, frankly, the light is not as good. So, we're going to solve that. But we're also going to solve incandescent bulbs. And people are so happy about it. It's really been pretty amazing. (Applause.) People don't tell you why. All they do is say, 'Oh, he's getting rid of an energy-efficient bulb.' Well, they don't tell you about the dangers of the bulb, and they don't tell you about the cost of that bulb. Over 100 Democrats have signed up to support the 100- trillion-dollar Green New Deal. (Laughter.) That's a beauty. No more cows. No more planes. I guess, no more people, right? (Laughter.) Because Kevin is just like a cow; he's just smaller. (Laughter.) I had to pick somebody for that one, Kevin, and I just looked at that beautiful, political face of yours, you know? (Laughter.) There's a little truth to that. But this Green New Deal is crazy. Now, they're talking about it tonight. I see hardened Democrat politicians that are , you know, have been smart. And I say, 'It's incredible. They're standing behind AOC' , I call her 'Cortez,' because you don't have enough time to go through the whole name. I just call , (laughter) , 'Cortez.' They don't like that, when you call her Cortez, but her name is Cortez. Too , too long. Or I call her 'AOC.' Then I call the others 'AOC plus 3.' (Laughter.) They don't like that. AOC plus 3. That's the definition. But you know, I see her, and I see what's she's talking. She's , she's going through this deal. It's so insane. But I don't want to talk about it. It's too early. I hit Pocahontas way too early. (Laughter.) I thought she was gone. She's emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she could beat Sleepy Joe. He's fallen asleep. He has no idea what the hell he's doing or saying. (Laughter.) And President Xi of China, he is tough. Oh, boy, he's a furious kind of a guy. Great guy, but fur- , he's dying to see , he wants Sleepy Joe. Can you imagine those two guys in a room? Here's Xi: 'Hwah!' And here's Sleepy Joe, 'What?' (Laughter.) 'Where am I? Where am I?' 'Just sign here, Sleepy Joe. Just sign here.' (Laughter.) 'Like you guys have been doing for the last 25 years. Let us keep taking $500 billion out of your account. Let's keep rebuilding China with America's money.' That's stopping. A lot of things are stopping that are bad and foolish, crazy. But we won't let Democrats obliterate domestic industry and cripple working-class families with sky-high energy prices. Democrats are proposing to pack the courts with lawless activist judges. We have one. We have many. Look at some of these rulings. But lately, we're doing well. Lately, we're doing well. (Applause.) And today, I signed the 150th judge. (Applause.) Federal judge. Think of it: One hundred and fifty, including court of appeals and two great Supreme Court justices. Think of that. (Applause.) And yesterday, coincidentally, we just won the asylum case. The big one. (Applause.) The big one. And we won it in a vote of 7 to 2. So, that wasn't a very close one, Kevin. Seven to two. And to me , so importantly , because we want to build that wall, we're going to build that wall, and we are building that wall. Because three months ago, we won the case on the wall, so that wall is being built and it's being built rapidly. (Applause.) And we hope to have as much as 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year. Five hundred miles. That's a lot. That's about what we want. (Applause.) And that's being built despite the most obstructive group of people I've ever seen. And, let me tell you, if they want to run their campaign on open borders, and if they want to run their campaign on some of the things they're saying , Green New Deal and all it entails , I just say, let them go. Don't criticize it too much, please. Because one thing I've learned about politics: You can say something one day that's just absolutely insane like they're saying, and then, about two weeks later, say the exact opposite. And nobody will ever even call you on it. It's the craziest business. You're in the craziest business I've ever seen. (Laughter.) It's crazy. You can do whatever you want, and then, two weeks later, they'll say something different. So I want to bring them way down the pike before we start criticizing the Green New Deal. So I just want to say, because we've got a lot of television watching tonight, even though, I guess, they should be watching the debate, but they're probably watching us. (Laughter and applause.) But we have a lot. See those cameras back there. We kept the reporters out. But we have those cameras. See those red bulbs? That means we're on live. But I will tell you this: The Green New Deal , we just want that thing to go as long as it can. Because anybody that can win office, promoting the Green New Deal, they deserve to win. (Laughter.) They got to be really good. They got to have the greatest line of crap anybody has ever had in the history of politics. (Laughter and applause.) Their delivery has to be perfect. Sometimes, unfortunately, delivery is more important than what you say. And theirs has to be. And I've always said about the Democrats, they're lousy politicians, but they have one thing that's incredible: They stick together. And you people have to stick together. And you do. I know you. We have more spirit with our congressmen and women than we've ever had , that, I see. And you're in a small , you're just a little short of taking the majority. And you're going to take it. You're going to take the majority. (Applause.) And Dan , Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy, they'll tell you because they saw what happened. We went into those communities and they went out to vote like nobody has ever seen before. And I'm going to stop at every community that I can. We're going to make a list of 50 or so, and we'll stop there. I got a lot of energy. That's good. If you don't have the energy, you can forget that one. (Applause.) Hillary , she'd make two stops and she'd say, 'I got to rest for a couple of weeks.' (Laughter.) 'Let me rest for a couple of weeks.' No, she didn't like stairs. She didn't like airplanes. She didn't like a lot. She said, 'I don't have to go to Wisconsin to campaign.' Her husband Bill, who is a pro, said, 'You know, I saw what they're doing in Wisconsin. I don't like it. There's a lot of those 'Trump' and 'Trump/Pence' signs out there. There's a lot of them. I don't like it.' 'Don't worry about it, darling. Wisconsin is going to be just fine.' 'The winner of Wisconsin is Donald Trump.' (Laughter.) 'There's a lot of signs,' he said. (Applause.) 'In Michigan, there's a lot of signs on the lawns. I was there. There's signs all over the place. You got to go back to Michigan more often.' 'No, no, no. You don't understand. Michigan hasn't been won for decades by a Republican. My people tell me we're great.' I don't know who her people were. Now, that's called , if they ever threatened me with that , that I colluded with her people , that I could understand. (Laughter.) That I could , because they told her, 'Don't go back to Michigan, darling. You're okay. Don't go back.' (Laughter.) 'Donald Trump has won the great state of Michigan.' (Laughter.) 'Donald Trump has won the great state of Pennsylvania, great state of North Carolina, the great state of Florida, the great state of South Carolina.' (Applause.) Remember they said we were going to lose Texas? They didn't say that. You know, look, they're crooked as hell. (Laughter.) But they did say , remember? They said, 'Texas is in play.' (Laughter.) So being somewhat new to the game , like having done it for about three months , I said, 'Let me ask you a question. What does it mean when they say it's in play?' 'Sir, that means it's too close to call.' Well, I'm like six or seven months out. They're saying Texas is in play. So I said, 'I don't think so.' I went to make a speech. We had a line that was miles long. I don't think so. And everybody else was telling me , a great guy got on in Texas, and he's wearing this big cowboy hat, this beautiful hat. I wish we could wear them. Nobody would ever look at my hair and criticize me. (Laughter.) I'd wear that hat and I'd never take it off. Do you ever notice, in Texas, they sit down and have breakfast here , they're wearing the hat. I like that. I would do that. (Laughter.) I don't have to worry about hairspray. I don't have to worry about my hair blowing , (laughter) , beautifully blowing in the wind. (Laughter.) And this guy is on television. A big, strong Texas guy. And they asked him about the race being so close. This is like five months before the election. He said, 'I don't know where you come from, but I come from Texas. And I'll tell you a couple of things, but one of the things I'll tell you for real: This race ain't close at all.' (Laughter.) 'Trump is going to win by a lot.' So we get to the evening, and they're saying, 'Texas is in play. It's too close. It's ' The polls close at eight o'clock. Now, unless you have a huge, commanding lead, you know, it's takes an hour, two hours, three hours before they predict, right? Before they say who won. And the polls closed. 'The polls have closed in Texas. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.' (Laughter and applause.) And for like six months , and then, today, I heard it again. I think , I think it was Buttigieg. (Laughter.) Buttigieg. They said, 'Think of it as 'boot' and then 'edge-edge.' Because nobody can pronounce this guy's name. (Laughter.) Nobody. Butt-i-gieg. They say, 'Buttigieg' , (laughter) , 'and Trump.' (Laughter.) On what I've done for energy, if anybody beat me in Texas , I don't think anybody can beat me. I don't think Rockefeller can beat me in Texas , the real Rockefeller, the first Rockefeller. I think he'd have a hard time beating me in Texas. But anyway, they said, 'Buttigieg ' (Laughter.) Can you believe this guy? He's doing a rotten job running his own city. Lousy job. But they say, 'Buttigieg is two points up in the state of Texas against President Trump.' I said, 'I don't think so. I don't think so.' No, I don't worry about that too much. What do you think, Louie? Who's winning Texas? Think Buttigieg is winning Texas? (Laughter.) I've had him up to here. (Laughter and applause.) Democrats care more about illegal aliens than their own constituents. Republicans know our duty is to represent American citizens. Democrats voted against Kate's Law. How about , what's Kate's Law , how about this? And now, they even threw out the charge about gun possession, which was like the smallest , he got away with murder. He got away , can you imagine? But it's not over yet. It's not over yet. What a horrible thing took place in San Francisco with that incredible, beautiful young woman, holding her father's hand and saying, 'Daddy. Daddy, what happened?' Can you imagine the shock of it? That's just incredible. And this low-life gets out. Gets out. And people all over the world see that, and they say, 'What the hell is wrong with the United States of America?' , when they see that. Last year, more than 80 percent of House Democrats refused to support our heroes , ICE. And nearly every House Democrat voted in favor of sanctuary cities, allowing illegal aliens with severe criminal records to terrorize innocent communities. And these two guys were tremendously successful in North Carolina because all we kept doing is saying the governor and all of these Democrats , right, Dan? , all of the Democrats want sanctuary cities. And they let somebody out fairly recently, and that somebody wreaked havoc. Wreaked havoc. I won't even tell you, it was so horrible. But wreaked havoc in a community. Instead of taking him and giving him to ICE , we would have done what you had to do. But I'll tell you, the folks of ICE , at ICE , and Border Patrol and law enforcement, they're not treated properly. And we respect them. Most Americans really respect them. (Applause.) Yeah. (Applause.) You know, we have MS-13 coming in. These are the toughest people you've ever seen, but they're not as tough as ICE. And ICE runs into their nests. You know, they call them a 'nest.' This is , these are people that don't even like guns because they're not painful enough. They take young women and they slice them up with a knife. They slice them up , beautiful, young , in a case, two 16-year-old young girls walking home from school. They took them and they sliced them up because it was more painful. They killed them. Animals. And then, if you use the term 'animal' , I mean, look, you know, Nancy Pelosi attacked me because I called them 'animals.' Remember that? She said, 'They're not animals. They're human beings.' Well, I don't think so. But ICE will go into a nest. They call it a 'nest' , where you have a lot of them congregating, up to no good. And ICE will run into that nest like it's , like they're having breakfast with their family on Monday morning. They're tough. And they're patriots, and they love our country. And we're throwing out MS-13 by the thousands. We're throwing them , we're getting them the hell out of our country. (Applause.) And even tough sheriffs say, 'You know, sir, better that they do it.' And I agree with them. Better that they do it. And the sheriffs agree. But they say, 'Better that they do it.' And then you have the Democrats. They want to keep them around. And they want to actually take care of them and protect them. And, I don't know, if you tell me that's good politics. And I don't even care about the politics. But it's so bad for our country. But if you tell me you can win with that , with open borders, with no ICE. If you don't have ICE, this country would be overridden. We take out thousands of people , bad people. Really bad people. Public servants make a sacred pledge to defend the nation and its people. Politicians who support sanctuary cities have forsaken this solemn vow. Instead of making a shameful pact to shield and harbor criminal fugitives at any cost , they will do it at any cost. But I'll tell you, people in California , and I see it more and more , they don't want sanctuary cities; it's the politicians that want them. A lot of the people are revolting in different communities. They don't want sanctuary cities. They want to be safe. They can't be safe with sanctuary cities. They're protecting, in many cases, criminals. In July, Montgomery County, Maryland, declared itself a sanctuary city for criminal aliens, forcing local jails to release these dangerous inmates, instead of safely handing them over to ICE. Just hand them over to ICE. Just hand them over to ICE. ICE will take care of the rest. Less than two months later, eight illegal aliens have already been arrested for rape, for sexual assault of a minor. Last month, local officials in Montgomery County released an accused criminal alien rapist back onto the streets, defying ICE's very powerful request to turn him over to them. In March, local officials in Durham County, North Carolina, ignored ICE and released an illegal alien arrested on felony robbery charges. A short time later, that same illegal alien was charged with murder of a 19-year-old woman in Georgia. This is happening, by the way, in over , these are stories I could , I could give you these stories all day long. I love the Angel Moms. I just love those women. I got , women and families , but I got to know a lot of them, what they've suffered and how they've suffered. And they're scorned by the radical Left. They're scorned. Who could scorn a person who lost their daughter put in an ashcan and burned? Stuffed into an ashcan and burned. And they find the person and it's like , who can , who can even , who could endure what they've been through? And it happens a lot. A few stories. It happens a lot. Far worse than what I'm telling you tonight. Far, far worse. Democrats believe our cities should be sanctuaries for violent criminal aliens. Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans. (Applause.) Democrats also believe any illegally alien who merely sets foot on U.S. soil should be automatically released into the interior of the United States and then given free healthcare for life. These craven policies impoverish U.S. communities while enriching human smugglers, traffickers, and vicious criminal cartels. Two hundred and eight House Democrats, nearly 90 percent of the Democrat Caucus, also voted against notifying ICE whenever an illegal alien tries to buy a gun. Meanwhile, Democrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans, so they're totally defenseless when somebody walks into their house with a gun. It's like, 'Whatever you want. Whatever you want. I'm defenseless. Whatever you want.' How crazy is this? Republicans will forever uphold the fundamental right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) Thank you. The agenda of the Democrat Party is the demolition of the American middle class, because that's what happens. Our Republican agenda is to make our neighborhoods safer, our families stronger, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. And we're on our way to doing it, but we have to win this next election. You know, I said the other day , and I don't know if anyone said it before, but it sounds like it should have been said many times before , but it's like a plant. You grow the plant. You put the plant in, but it hasn't really grabbed on yet. And it won't grab on; it needs a little time. We need a little time. We've done tremendous changes in our country. Tremendous changes. And we're going to do other changes. A lot of really great other changes. But we need that additional time to let it grab on, because they will destroy so much of what we've done, and we can't let that happen. You won't have energy. You won't have business. You won't have jobs. You won't have income. It will be a disaster. So you have to fight like hell. I tell the story of a man who hates me. One of the most successful businesspeople always hated me and I've always hated him. I can't stand that guy. (Laughter.) And I meet him recently and I see him, and he's working with my people on helping us out with fundraisers and everything. I say, 'What are you doing here?' 'I'm trying to help you get elected.' I said, 'You got to be kidding me.' And then, I looked at him and I said, 'But actually, you do have no choice.' Isn't it true? You don't have a choice. He said, 'No, I really respect what you've done over the last three years' , almost three years now , 'and I really respect, and it's been great for business, and it's been great for jobs. I have many more people working for me than I had when you became President. And it's really incredible what's happened.' And for the first time in my entire life, I really like this guy. (Laughter.) Although, he's a tough guy. He's a bad guy. But, no, he's one of many. I go to audiences , I was joking one time recently. I walked up to him; I said, 'Listen, I don't have to make a very long speech. You really have to elect me. Whether you like me or not, it makes no difference, because our country will go to hell. If any of these people get in, it will go to hell. So I'm going to leave now. Goodbye everybody.' And I joked. And then I came back and I talked. But I said, 'You know, I was joking, but I'm really not joking. You have no choice.' Because whoever they put in, the saner they are, the worse they're doing. And whoever they put in , and it looks like it's going to be a revolution to the Left , they're going to take your money. They're going to take , and very much hurt your families. I just don't think people can allow that to happen. We have a country that's doing, I think, better than ever before. The economy is the strongest it's ever been. Most powerful, our military , all of the things we've discussed. You have to fight so hard that we win this election. You have to fight so hard. I had a big meeting today on ethanol and the farmers, and it was an incredible meeting. And I sat around, and Chuck Grassley was there and Joni Ernst and John Thune and Mike Pounds and so many , just a whole group of great people. And just sitting around the room. Ben Sasse, who's actually become very good over the last year , we had a little arguments before, but doesn't matter , Ben Sasse was there. We had just a great group of people. And as were sitting in the Oval Office talking about farmers, I realized that all of these people have to make sure that we win because the farmers will be totally put out of business. Many businesses will be put out of business. I just don't even know what they're thinking. What are they doing? What are they doing? And I said to some of the people around the table, strong Republicans, but really people that just love the country. I said, 'You really have to make sure that we win, because if you don't, this country is in such trouble.' So I used to talk about 2016 as being a very important election, and it was. But in its own way, this is , I'll never say 'of' , of, you know, 'more important,' but I can almost say 'of equal importance' because everything that we've done, everything that we've gained , and the biggest gains are to come because the hard work of getting it approved. You people were involved with so much of it. It was so hard and we got things done. I mean, those tax cuts , all the things we did are so hard. We would have had healthcare done, and we will get it done if we get back the House and if we keep the Senate and keep the presidency, we'll get it done. We would have had healthcare done except for , (applause) , we had one little surprising vote late in the evening. But we would have had it done. We would have had it done, and we'll get it done. If we get back the House, we're going to get it done, as sure as you can be. But even on healthcare, we've done such a good job, and with the individual mandate and all of the other things we've been able to do. We're fighting for everyday citizens who work hard, pay their taxes, raise their children, follow our laws, serve our communities, respect our police, and believe in America with their every ounce, really, of their heart and their soul. We're fighting to protect their jobs, to defend their families, and to ensure their children can live the American Dream. You know, the Republican Party is actually loved in this country. And I think, in a certain way, loved like never before, because we they see that we're fighting for this country. We're fighting for what we grew up with. What , the values that we want. The Republican Party , you know, some people probably take it a little bit for granted, but you really are; you're loved out there. I see it. I see it all the time. Whenever I went , I saw it in North Carolina the other day. I'm backstage waiting to go on, and so many people have come up to me and they say, 'Sir, thank you for saving our nation.' Well, you're equal to me. What you , what you've done is incredible. Some of the things that you've done in a short period of time is pretty damn incredible. (Applause.) A nation's first duty is to care for its own citizens, and that is why we're working to give the American people a high-quality, low-cost , and this is what's going to happen , we want a low-cost healthcare system with more transparency and more choice. You know, we're doing transparency. I think you've all seen that. And a man came in who's an expert , he's a tremendous, tremendous man who I have a lot of respect for , and he said, 'Transparency.' I said, 'Explain transparency.' Sounds very simple. And I got it done. This is where people can go to hospitals and price, and they can pick their doctor. He said, 'Sir, this is bigger than any healthcare you can do. You watch.' And it will be put into effect , Secretary Azar, who's doing an incredible job , it will be put into effect fairly soon. We signed it about four months ago. It's being worked out. People are able to go in and negotiate the prices. You know, you have these horror stories where a woman will cut her hand and go into a hospital. You don't ask how much. But they'll go into a hospital and have the hand, and then they'll get billed $5,000. And they don't have $5,000. The horror stories are unbelievable. And we went through it. And some of you were in the room when I did signings. But we're having transparency, where you can have lists of prices. When you have some problem, they list it. You can go and negotiate prices. You can go to the drug store and say, 'Well, we want to see, how much is that? How much ' You know, right now you can't even do that. They don't let you do that. But now we do. And we've opened that up too. We've done a lot. Right to Try is something we've done a great job , you people have. (Applause.) You have to see the results on Right to Try. But a person can be terminally ill in the old system, and we could have a drug that we know works but is still going to take another year or two of testing, and we tell the person, 'I'm sorry, we can't let you use that drug because it may hurt you.' Well, you're going to die within three weeks or four weeks. You're terminally ill. They've wanted to do this for 45 years. And it's not as easy as all that. The country was worried that they'll sue the country. The doctors were worried they'd sue the doctors through the insurance companies, sue the pharmaceutical companies. I got everybody into a room. I said, 'Listen, what we do is we sign an agreement where we guarantee ' , and a tough agreement , ' where you guarantee that we have no liability, the doctor has no liability, the pharmaceutical company has no liability, and various other things.' I said, 'And everybody's happy.' Then they said, 'Well, we don't want them on the list.' If a person is terminally ill, the pharmaceutical companies , I understood that. 'We don't want them on our list.' Because they do a list of success. 'And when a person is very, very sick , maybe toward the end of their life, terminally ill , we don't want that person on our list as a sample, as a test sample.' I said, 'I understand that. So we're not going to have that person on your list. When you do this, we're not going to have that person on your list. We create a separate list of very, very sick, terminally ill people. But for your list, we're not going to put it.' They said, 'Wow, we like that.' And we got it signed. And you have to see the success. People used to go to Asia. They'd go to Europe. They'd go all over the world looking, if they had money. Most people didn't have the money, so they'd go home and they'd die. Now they have the Right to Try. And I congratulate you on that because you were the ones that really did a job. (Applause.) And Greg was great , wherever Greg may be. Is Greg here? Greg? Where's Greg? Oh, boy, you stood up fast. That's good. (Applause.) Thank you, Greg. I'd call Greg and I'd say, 'Man, you've got to get it done.' And it wasn't easy like people would've thought. Do you agree with that? That was not easy. We had more people coming at us , thank you very much, Greg. It was a fantastic job. And a lot of other folks in the room. That's why we're ending years of economic surrender and we're confronting China's chronic trading abuses. For years, past leaders let China freely loot our economy, racking up trillions and trillions of dollars in costly trade deficits. Now, the world is on notice that people aren't going to be able to do that to the United States anymore. They're not doing it anymore, and they know it. They know it. They get it. They come to me and they see me , the leaders. I know them all now, pretty much. Some I have great respect for. Some I don't get along with as well. You know, there was a poll recently that Obama is much more popular in Germany than I am. I said, 'Of course he is.' He's not saying to Germany, 'You've got to pay us for the military.' He's not saying to Germany, 'Why are you paying billions and billions of dollars to Russia for a pipeline coming in?' And then we defend , how about that one? We pay billions of dollars to Russia and then we defend Germany from Russia. Figure , does that work, right? (Laughter.) Does that work? Give Russia billions and then we defend you. Oh, that's a wonderful deal. We've got plenty of those deals. That's one of the better ones. With your help, we will also achieve a historic victory for the American farmer, rancher, and workers by replacing the horrible disaster , to me, one of the worst deals ever , NAFTA. And we're replacing it with the USMCA, which really is incredible. (Applause.) Got to get it up for a vote. They've got to put it up for a vote. By the way, the Democrats are going to vote for it. Unions love it. Farmers love it. I would say unions like it. But they like it. They hate NAFTA. It's their all-time least. Manufacturers love it. The farmers are desperate for it; it's so important. And let it be bipartisan. I told Nancy Pelosi. 'Nancy, put it up for a vote. It's going to bipartisan. You can have all the credit you want. You have to do something other than try and impeach somebody that didn't do anything wrong. You have to.' (Laughter.) I said, 'It's hard to impeach somebody who didn't do anything wrong.' The Mueller report is out. There's no collusion, after two and a half years. Think of it. How ridiculous: I collude with Russia. In fact, Russia said, 'You know, if we really did pick him, we made a real bad choice.' (Laughter.) Think of it. Even tonight, I'm talking about we have the strongest military. We're spending billions and billions. We're the strongest military, right? We have the strongest energy. Hillary wanted windmills. She wanted solar. Solar is fine , you know, small potatoes, compared to what we're talking about. It doesn't have the power that you need. And someday, good. I love solar. I think solar is good, but it's limited. The wind is very expensive because you put up those windmills , I know it very well. First of all, they're made in Germany and they're made in China. Think of the pollutants that go on the air when they're making these massive steel things. If it's anywhere near your house, your house is way down in value. Try dropping a windmill someplace close to your house. Try selling your house. They make noise. They kill all the birds. The energy is intermittent. If you happen to be watching the Democrat debate and the wind isn't blowing, you're not going to the see the debate. 'Charlie, what the hell happened to this debate?' (Laughter.) He says, 'Darling, the wind isn't blowing. The goddamn windmill stopped. That windmill stopped.' (Laughter.) Republicans know that American families are the true backbone of America. That is why I was the first President to propose nationwide paid family leave in my budget. Very important. (Applause.) Women want it. Our goal is to ensure that every American family enjoys an amazing quality of life. Together, we are going to fix our housing finance system. We're working on that very hard , to protect the dream of ownership for the next generation. We're going to make new cars more affordable and much safer. My administration will soon issue standards that will save families thousands and thousands, as I've said, of dollars per car. We're going to fight for the future of cities like Baltimore that have been destroyed by decades of failed and corrupt rule. (Applause.) The left-wing agenda of total government domination, crushing regulation, crippling taxes, unrestricted migration, and un- , and I mean, think of this , it's undermining all law enforcement. They undermine law enforcement and they devastate America's inner cities. They've been devastated. And even the cities like Los Angeles , look at what's happening. It's like , look at what's happening. San Francisco. Take a look at what's going on. And we're going to have to step in and do something about it because we can't allow that to happen to our great cities. Los Angeles is a great city. (Applause.) We can't allow it. And in the not-too-distant future, you're going to see. We're going to step in. We're not going to allow it to happen, where major, major companies are leaving their cities. They're leaving our country when they see that. You walk in. They pay a lot of rent. They walk into a beautiful building , the best street in California. And you have a site that nobody even can believe. Nobody can believe. And we're going to have to do something about it. And we will do something about it. We're going to give them notice. In fact, we gave them a notice a today: Clean it up. You got to do something. You can't have it. These are our great American cities and they're an embarrassment, what the Democrats have let happen. Republicans want to rebuild our inner cities and provide a future of limitless opportunity for all Americans. And Republicans believe that parents should have the right to send their kids to the school of their choice. (Applause.) So, just in concluding, in everything we do, Republicans are fighting for the values that bring us together as one nation, under God. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand up for the heroes of law enforcement. We reject globalism and we embrace patriotism. We believe that there is no treasure on Earth more valuable than our American citizenship. (Applause.) We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, cherish our heroes, and always respect our great American flag. (Applause.) These are the values that unite us tonight. These are the values that bind our country. These are the values the American people share, deep in their souls. And these are the values that Republicans will champion all across the land. And that's what's happening. And that's why people love what you're doing. That's why people are loving the Republican Party again. (Applause.) Our task is to be confident in these truths, certain of this vision, bold in our actions, and forever loyal to the citizens we serve. If we stay true to our mission , and we have to, and we have to stick together like they do. They've got nothing else on us, but, like I said, they stick together. If we remain firm in our convictions, if we always put America first, then there will be no limit to the progress that we will make, no bounds to the good that we will do, no ceiling on the heights that we will reach, and no end to the victories we will achieve. We will win, win, win. And we will keep on winning. You know, I tell that story and some people love it, and probably some don't, but I think they all love it. I'm going to win a place like , here we go. I'm going to use Dan as an example. I'm in North Carolina, and I'm going to say, 'We're going to win again. We're going to win so much.' Right, Dan? We're going to so much. We're going to win, win, win. (Applause.) And our country , you go back and we haven't been doing so much winning with trade and with all of these different things. And I'm going to go , I'm going to go to Dan Bishop, and I'm going to say, 'Dan, we're going to win.' And they're going to come in to see Dan. They're going to say, 'Please, please, stop the President from winning. We're winning so much. Dan, go visit. You're our new congressman. Go to the Oval Office. He respects you because, unlike these other people, he doesn't know you so well. So you are still respected.' (Laughter.) 'And please, see the President and talk to the President. Tell him to stop winning so much. We don't want to win so much in the great state of North Carolina.' And I'm going to say, 'Dan, I'm sorry. I'm not doing that. We're going to keep winning, winning, winning.' Right, Dan? We're going to keep winning, winning, winning. (Applause.) Congratulations. After all we've achieved and after everything that we've accomplished, our message is simple: The best is yet to come. (Applause.) The best is yet to come. Together, we will make America stronger, and safer, and prouder, and greater than ever before. And I want to thank everybody for being tonight. You are a terrific group and I know almost all of you. I like most of you. I know all of you. (Laughter.) No, you are. You're a terrific group, and I think we're going to have a terrific, long time together. And Kevin, and everybody, I want to thank you. This was an incredible evening. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)",

         "We're here today to celebrate and expand our historic campaign to rescue American workers from job-killing regulations. Before I came into office, American workers were smothered by a merciless avalanche of wasteful and expensive and intrusive federal regulation. These oppressive, burdensome mandates were a stealth tax on our people - slashing take-home pay, suppressing innovation, surging the cost of goods, and shipping millions of American jobs overseas - millions and millions and millions. It never ended. Nearly four years ago, we ended this regulatory assault on the American worker, and we launched the most dramatic regulatory relief campaign in American history by far. No other administration has done anywhere near. Thank you. At the heart of this effort was a revolutionary promise: For every one new regulation issued, we pledged that two federal regulations would be permanently removed. We not only met that ambitious goal - which, at the time, people said was impossible - we vastly exceeded it. For every one new regulation added, nearly eight federal regulations have been terminated. Been an incredible achievement. As you can see behind me, we have removed the gigantic, regulatory burden Americans have been forced to carry for decades, freeing our citizens to reach their highest potential. Our historic regulatory relief is providing the average American household an extra $3,100 every single year. And we're going up from that number. We're going up from that number. Think of that: $3,100 per household. Joining us today is Vice President Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Wilbur, thank you very much. Labor Secretary, Eugene Scalia. Thank you. Thank you, Gene. Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar. Thank you, Alex. Transportation Secretary, Elaine Chao. Thank you, Elaine. We had a great day in Georgia yesterday, cutting regulations like nobody has ever seen before. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you very much. OMB Acting Director, Russ Vought. Thank you, Russ. And Small Business Administrator - I love her name - Jovita Carranza. Jovita, thank you. Thank you. And CMS Administrator Seema Verma. Thank you, Seema. Great people. Those are great people. They do an incredible job. I also want to thank the many state and local, tribal leaders who join us in this great cause. Thank you very much, and thank you for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you all very much. What we have achieved together is truly without precedent - never happened before. The previous administration added over 16,000 pages of heavy-handed regulations to the Federal Register. That's why nothing got done. Under my administration, we have removed nearly 25,000 pages of job-destroying regulations - more than any other President by far in the history of our country, whether it was four years, eight years, or, in one case, more than eight years. The prior administration piled up more than 600 major new regulations - a cruel and punishing regulatory burden that cost the average American an additional $2,300 per year. Think of that: The average American, $2,300, regulation - hitting low-income Americans, by far, the hardest. These regulations also inflicted a steep economic toll on African American communities. By contrast, our reforms are putting more money into the pockets of hardworking Americans. In addition to saving every family more than $3,000 per year, my administration has just issued another reform that my Council of Economic Advisers estimates will lower the price of new vehicles by more than $2,200 per vehicle. And I think we're going to get that up to $3,500 per vehicle. It's very exciting. And, by the way, the vehicles will be better, they'll be stronger, and they'll be safer. Our regulation cuts are also delivering massive savings on broadband Internet services, and some home energy bills will be really historically cut - it's actually amazing - as well as historically low gasoline prices. Gasoline prices - you look today - I think it was $1.99. At the same time, we saved our oil companies - we're now the largest since we've been here - the largest energy source in the world. Nobody is even close. So it's great. But we saved them. They had a hard time a number of months ago - and, frankly, for a long time - but we've saved them. But $1.99, they were telling me - and, in some cases, lower than that. We're bringing back consumer choice in home appliances so that you can buy washers and dryers, showerheads and faucets. So showerheads - you take a shower, the water doesn't come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn't come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair - I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect. Dishwashers - you didn't have any water, so you - the people that do the dishes - you press it, and it goes again, and you do it again and again. So you might as well give them the water because you'll end up using less water. So we made it so dishwashers now have a lot more water. And in many places - in most places of the country, water is not a problem. They don't know what to do with it. It's called 'rain.' They don't have a problem. And old-fashioned incandescent lightbulbs - I brought them back. I brought them back. They have two nice qualities: They're cheaper and they're better. They look better, and they make you look so much better. That's important to all of us. But they're better and much cheaper. And they were mandated out, legislated out. And we brought them back, and they're selling like hotcakes. We stopped the egregious abuse of the Clean Water Act, which extreme activists have used to shut down construction projects all across our country. When I signed that legislation, I had many farmers and construction people standing behind me - people that haven't cried since they were a baby. Some of them never even when they were a baby, and they were crying. Many people were cry- - we gave them back their life. They took away their land. They took away their rights. They took away their life. By reining in EPA overreach, my administration has returned the agency to its core mission of ensuring clean air, clean water, and a truly pristine natural environment. Our air now and our water is as clean as it's been in the last four decades. Yesterday, our country achieved yet another groundbreaking milestone by completing a sweeping overhaul of America's badly broken infrastructure approval process. It was totally out of control. Instead of taking up to 20 years to approve a major project, we're cutting the federal permitting timeline - it's already been done - to a maximum of two years or less; in some cases, even less than one year. And it's possible that it won't qualify. It's possible that it won't be good environmentally or safety-wise, in which case, at least in a period of a year or two, we'll raise the hand and you won't make it. But most projects will make it, but you won't go for 10, 15, 18 or 20 years. There are many horror stories that we could relay. We're reclaiming America's proud heritage as a nation of builders. My administration has also eliminated massive regulatory barriers in our battle against the China virus. These actions save countless lives, speeding up the production of equipment. That means ventilators like nobody has ever seen before. Probably the greatest source of manufacturing, the greatest achievements since World War Two. We're now making ventilators for countries all over the world. And medicine - accelerating the delivery of lifesaving treatments and ensuring that we will have a vaccine in a record time. We're doing fantastically well on that. That'll be for another time, another meeting. But we are doing, on therapeutics and vaccines, incredibly well. No administration in history has removed more red tape more quickly to rescue the economy and to protect the health of our people. When you think of it, we are all set up; that as we get the vaccine or therapeutic - and we're set up, militarily - we're going to be delivering it in record time. It's all set to move. We put an investment upfront. And we have logistical people - generals, great people - they're going to be delivering this all over the country as soon as we have it. And we've made tremendous progress. You've been reading about it. In total, we've taken more than 740 actions to suspend regulations that would have slowed our response to the China virus. This includes lifting restrictions on manufacturers so that our great autoworkers could produce more than 100,000 ventilators. So we've done over 100,000 in 100 days. Think of that. And we didn't have ventilators. We weren't set up for ventilators. We became a country that's making a lot of them, helping so many others - countries that are never going to be in a position to make them. They're complex, they're expensive, they're big. Very, very, very tough to do. And we've saved a lot of lives. And there's never been a person in our country - even though we started with almost nothing; I say the cupboard was bare when we took over. We started with nothing. There's never been a person in our country - even though we had just absolutely no - we were - we were going on empty - never been one person that needed a ventilator that didn't get it. Think of that. Not one person - as complex as they are, as big, as expensive. Take a long time to get them done. Not one person has ever needed a ventilator that didn't get it. We made telemedicine - . Thank you. Great job. Great - really, a great job. The people here, they get no credit for it. I don't want any credit. They should get the credit, but they get no credit. But we've done a great job helping so many other countries now. We made telemedicine available to all American patients and allowed doctors to work across state lines. I will tell you, the telemedicine is something that's really gone up by thousands and thousands of percentage points of percent. Because what happened is people that wouldn't even think of using telemedicine, all of a sudden, started using it, and it's really turned out to be good. Really, really turned out to be good, and it solved a lot of problems. So that's something. There's been great advancement. Furthermore, I have ordered federal agencies to look for ways to make these healthcare reforms totally permanent. Vice President Pence is also working closely with state, local, and tribal leaders to streamline occupational licensing. Over 30 states have taken steps to reduce these barriers to unemployment and to employment, and - including a state that I love very much - I have a little history in that state - the great state of Alaska. Thank you very much, Governor, for being here. Mike Dunleavy. Mike, thank you very much. In Idaho, Governor Brad Little, who is here today with us as well, set a new record for regulatory relief. Good job, Brad. Good. Good governor. Great governor. Two great governors. The American people know best how to run their own lives. They don't need Washington bureaucrats controlling their every move and micromanaging their every decision. With each regulation we cut, we're not only returning the money and the power to our citizens, we are draining the Washington swamp, and they're not happy about it - I can tell you that. I think you know that. The swamp was deep. I just didn't know how deep. Deeper than I thought. Joining us today are a few of the countless Americans who are personally benefitting from our pro-worker reforms. Joe Cambria owns Cambria Truck Center in New Jersey - a good state, New Jersey - and it's been really something that he's seen firsthand how our regulation cuts have helped create thousands and thousands of jobs. Joe, please come up and say a few words. Thank you, Joe. Thank you very much. Thanks. Good job. Good job. That was easy, wasn't it? Huh? Thank you very much. Great job. Dr. Amy Johnson is a nurse practitioner in rural Virginia. Amy, please come up and share with us how important expanded healthcare and telehealth has been for you and your patients. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. So that's been a great help to you, telehealth. It's been an incredible - it's been an incredible thing. Great job. Thank you very much. Jim Chilton is a rancher from Arizona who was crushed by the Obama-Biden administration's ridiculous Waters of the United States rule - it's been a catastrophic rule, but it's gone now - which gave bureaucrats power to regulate every puddle on private land as though it were a lake. Jim, please come up and tell us of your experience, which I know wasn't a good one, but it's a good one now. Please. Thank you, Jim. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jim. That was my honor, Jim, and thank you very much. It's terrible. It was - that you had to suffer so long. They took your property away from you. And you want to take care of your property better than any government is going to tell you to take care of your property. You'll take care of it better, so we don't have to worry about that. Thank you very much. Beautifully said. Thank you. I want to just, as President, say that I will always fight to defend your rights and your freedoms. We'll fight very hard for your rights and your freedoms. The hard left wants to reverse these extraordinary gains and re-impose these disastrous regulations. They want to take what we've taken off, Jim, and they want to - they want to put them back on. And I guess they can do that. You'll fight them for a little while, but eventually you'll lose. And they want to bury our economy under suffocating, relentless landslides of Washington red tape like we had before I got here. We must never return to the days of soul-crushing regulation that ravaged our cities, devastated our workers, drained our vitality - and right out of our people - and thoroughly crippled our nation's prized competitive edge. It's what we have: We have great, great people. The greatest people in the world. Our entire economy and our very way of life are threatened by Biden's plans to transform our nation and subjugate our communities through the blunt-force instrument of federal regulation at a level that you haven't even seen yet. You think that was bad? You haven't even seen it yet. They want to go many times what they put you under in the past. Under the 'unity' platform Joe Biden published with socialist Bernie Sanders, they are proposing - and this is all in writing; it's done; they agreed - they are proposing to reenter the job-killing, unfair Paris Climate Accord, which will cost our country trillions of dollars - trillions and trillions of dollars - and put us in a very, very bad competitive position relative to the world. Not surprising to you, China will be greatly advanced under this ridiculous agreement, and so will Russia, so will many other countries. They propose to mandate net-zero emissions from all new homes and buildings, skyrocketing the cost of construction and putting the goal of homeownership out of reach for millions - destroying the look of the home, the beauty of the home. I'm somebody that's built many homes, many buildings. If you take a look at this, it doesn't look good. You still have to sell, right? You still have to sell. But they've put it out of reach, from a cost standpoint. Totally out of reach. It's not practical, it's not good, and it doesn't work. They want to eliminate carbon from the U.S. energy industry, which means abolishing all American oil, clean coal, and natural gas. No coal, no gas, no oil, nothing to fire our massive plants. The result of this federally mandated shutdown would be the wholesale destruction of the entire energy industry and many other industries, the economic evisceration of entire communities, and the unfettered offshoring of millions of our best jobs to foreign countries and foreign polluters. Millions and millions of jobs would go. Thousands and thousands of countries would be at a level that you've never seen. Companies would be disappearing left and right, just like they did with NAFTA, which we terminated for the USMCA, which was another beauty that we've done - not for now, but another great beauty. But thousands of companies, plants, factories would be closed. Under this dismal future, energy would be unaffordable for the vast majority of Americans, and the American Dream would be sniffed out so quickly and replaced with a socialist disaster. The Democrats in D.C. have been and want to, at a much higher level, abolish our beautiful and successful suburbs by placing far-left Washington bureaucrats in charge of local zoning decisions. They are absolutely determined to eliminate single-family zoning, destroy the value of houses and communities already built, just as they have in Minneapolis and other locations that you read about today. Your home will go down in value and crime rates will rapidly rise. Joe Biden and his bosses from the radical left want to significantly multiply what they're doing now. And what will be the end result is you will totally destroy the beautiful suburbs. Suburbia will be no longer as we know it. So they wanted to defund and abolish your police and law enforcement while at the same time destroying our great suburbs. The suburb destruction will end with us. Next week, I will be discussing the AFFH rule - AFFH rule, a disaster - and our plans to protect the suburbs from being obliterated by Washington Democrats, by people on the far left that want to see the suburbs destroyed, that don't care. People have worked all their lives to get into a community, and now they're going to watch it go to hell. Not going to happen, not while I'm here. The Biden-Bernie plan would also use the weapon of federal regulation to tie the hands of our police departments by abolishing cash bail - think of that. Think of that: bail. 'No problem. They killed somebody? Let them out.' Take a look at what's happening: Crime in New York City up 368 percent from just a short while ago. They got rid of a lot of police, and they're in the process of doing it a billion dollars. They probably want to abolish. It's not even believable. When I first heard about it, when you first heard about it, you didn't think it was real. You didn't think it was believable. Just like the Green New Deal. How crazy is that? But they're actually trying to put it into play. It'll mean the end of this country. So by getting rid of bail, they are incentivizing jail and prison closures - they want to get rid of prisons; they don't think anybody should go to prison - setting loose violent criminals; appointing left-wing social justice prosecutors, like you have in Philadelphia, where people creating and doing the most criminal of acts are let go, in many cases immediately, and making our wonderful cops - our great, great police, cops - subordinate to distant bureaucrats who have never spent a day in their lives fighting crime. Unlike the socialists, we believe in the rule of the people, not the rule of the unelected bureaucrats that don't know what they're doing. We believe in the dignity of the individual, not the iron grip of the state. Our regulatory reforms are vital not only to the success of our economy, but the strength of our democracy and the survival of liberty itself. My administration will continue pressing forward until we have made every last vestige of Washington fully, completely, and totally accountable to the citizens of the United States. We are putting our faith in the workers who power our country: the doctors who care for our country, the truckers who sustain our country, and the farmers and ranchers who preserve our country in all of its majestic beauty. The American people are the ones who made our nation great, and together, we will make it greater, by far, than ever before. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much for being with us. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. We must've said something right. I guess we said it absolutely right. It's about our country. It's about our country. We want to be strong, we want to respect everybody, but we have to have strong law enforcement. And that's taking place in the areas that we're responsible for. We want others to call us for help. There's nothing wrong. Let Chicago call. Let Seattle call. We were going into Seattle, all set to go, and then they did it themselves. They heard we were coming in, and the hands went up; they gave up. It's so terrible when you see what's happening. Minneapolis - we said, 'Get the guard in there.' Three nights: 'Get the guard in. Get the Guard.' We got the Guard in. The National Guard. They've done a fantastic job. As soon as they showed up, it was like a knife cutting through butter. You saw that, right? After four days of horror. It wasn't the police's fault in - in any of these places. They were told to leave. The police are, generally speaking, they do a great job. They were told to leave. But you saw what happened. Minneapolis - 'Grab - grab your gun and run.' That's not what they wanted to do. But the National Guard came in, and we did a great job. No problem after that, do you notice? We just passed a statues and monument executive order. And they were going wild. They - see that beautiful - look at it right there. It's so beautiful - the Washington Monument. If they had the choice, they'd take it down. And I guarantee you they'd rename it. They want to rename it. They want George Washington out. They want Thomas Jefferson out. They want Abraham Lincoln out. They want abolitionists out. They don't know what they want. They just want to destroy our country. We're not going to let it happen. We're not letting it happen. So I'd now like to ask Vice President Mike Pence to say a few words. Thank you, Mike. So we have many exciting things that we'll be announcing over the next eight weeks, I would say. Things that nobody has even contemplated, thought about, thought possible, and things that we're going to get done and we have gotten done - and we've started in most cases. But it's going to be a very exciting eight weeks, a eight weeks, like I prob- - I think, Mike, we can honestly say nobody has ever going to see eight weeks like we're going to have. Because we really have - we have - we're taking on immigration, taking on education, we're taking on so many aspects of things that people were hopelessly tied up in knots in Congress. They can't - they've been working on some of these things for 25, 30 years. It wasn't happening. But you'll see levels of detail, and you'll see levels of thought that a lot of people believed very strongly we didn't have in this country. We're going to get things done. We're going to get things done that they've wanted to see done for a long, long time. So I think we'll start sometime on Tuesday. We'll be discussing our one plan on suburbia, but that's one of many, many different plans. Then we're going into the immigration - the world of immigration, the world of education. We're going into the world of healthcare - very complete healthcare. And we have a lot of very exciting things to discuss. But cutting of regulation has been really something that I felt we could do, and we could do fairly easily. Nothing is easy in this country. We had statutory requirements where we'd do phase one, and then we'd have to wait 90 days. We'd do phase two, and we'd have to wait 60 days. You'd do phase three, and we're set - 'Let's do phase four, sir.' 'I'm sorry you have to wait one year.' But we were able to do things that nobody has ever been able to do, or even close, on deregulation. And these trucks - this really is a great - a great little example. I don't know who thought of this idea, but it's actually quite, quite simple and quite good. Is that Brooke? Quite simple and quite good. I don't love having that big sucker hanging over my head. I want to get out of here as fast as possible. But I do want to thank you all. Incredible people. You've done an incredible job. And to the speakers, please, thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.",

         "Thank you very much. Good morning. So I came here to do a meeting on infrastructure with Democrats, not really thinking they wanted to do infrastructure or anything else, other than investigate. And I just saw that Nancy Pelosi, just before our meeting, made a statement that 'We believe that the President of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.' Well, it turns out I'm the most , and I think most of you would agree to this , I'm the most transparent President, probably in the history of this country. We have given , on a witch hunt, on a hoax , the whole thing with Russia was a hoax, as it relates to the Trump administration and myself. It was a total horrible thing that happened to our country. It hurt us in so many ways. Despite that, we're setting records with the economy, with jobs. We have the most , most people employed today that we've ever had in the history of our country. We have the best unemployment numbers that we've had in the history of our country , in some cases, 51 years, but generally in the history of our country. Companies are moving back in. Things are going well. And I said, 'Let's have the meeting on infrastructure. We'll get that done easily.' That's one of the easy ones. And instead of walking in happily into a meeting, I walk in to look at people that had just said that I was doing a cover-up. I don't do cover-ups. You people know that probably better than anybody. And I was just looking at a list of some of the things that we just did: more than 2,500 subpoenas qualified for. And I let everybody talk. I let the White House Counsel speak for 30 hours. Thirty hours. I have 19 Special Counsel lawyers; 40 FBI agents. I said, 'Open it all up. Let them have whatever they want.' Nearly 500 search warrants. Think of that: a search warrant. Did you ever see a search warrant before? Neither did I. This was over 500 search warrants. And of the 19 people that were heading up this investigation, or whatever you want to call it, with Bob Mueller, they were contributors to the Democrat Party, most of them, and to Hillary Clinton. They hated President Trump. They hated him with a passion. They went to her big party after the election that turned out to be a wake, not a party. It was a wake. And they were very angry. These are the people that, after two years and 40 million or 35 million dollars , it'll end up being a lot more than that by the time all the bills are paid , this is what happened. No collusion. No obstruction. No nothing. They issued 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers. Think of that, though. Five hundred witnesses. And then I have Nancy Pelosi go out and say that the President of the United States engaged in a cover-up. Now, we've had a House investigation. We have Senate investigations. We have investigations like nobody has ever had before. And there's nothing , we did nothing wrong. They would have loved to have said we colluded. They would have loved it. These people were out to get us, the Republican Party and President Trump. They were out to get us. This was a one-sided, horrible thing. The bottom line is they said there's no collusion. No collusion with Russia. You heard so much talk about phone calls that my son made to me from this meeting that was set up by GPS Fusion, it looks like , which is the other side, for those that don't know. And for a year, I heard about phone calls went to a special number unauthorized. And it would have been my son, Don , who's a good young man, who's gone through hell. And they were calls that must have been made by him before and after the meeting , three calls. After massive study and work, they actually found who made the calls. One was a friend of ours , a real estate developer. Great guy. Most of you know him. Nice guy. He loves our country. And the other one was the head of NASCAR. Two of them. So, of the three calls that were so horrible that he had a meeting and he called me and then he had the meeting after and he made two more calls , and they were written about like this little , little lines, couple of lines. Nobody wanted to admit it. Even last night, we had a great election. I went there on Monday. We had a , an election for Fred Keller. It was a 50/50 shot, and he won in a landslide. We went and we did a rally. Hardly mentioned today. And yet, if he lost, it would have been the biggest story in the country , even bigger than this witch hunt stuff that you guys keep writing about. So here's the bottom line: There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. We've been doing this since I've been President. And, actually, the crime was committed on the other side. We'll see how that all turns out. I hope it turns out well. But to my way of thinking , and I know a lot of you agree with me , the crime was committed on the other side. This whole thing was a take-down attempt at the President of the United States. And, honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves for the way you report it so it dishonestly , not all of you, but many of you. The way you report it. So I've said from the beginning, right from the beginning, that you probably can't go down two tracks. You can go down the investigation track, and you can go down the investment track or the track of 'Let's get things done for the American people.' I love the American people. Drug prices are coming down , first time in 51 years , because of my administration. But we can get them down way lower working with the Democrats. We can solve the problem on the border in 15 minutes if the Democrats would give us a few votes. So I just wanted to let you know that I walked into the room and I told Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi, 'I want to do infrastructure. I want to do it more than you want to do it. I'd be really good at that. That's what I do. But you know what? You can't do it under these circumstances. So get these phony investigations over with.' The Wall Street Journal just wrote today , just a little while ago, I saw it: 'Mr. Mueller wasn't obstructed in any way.' This is a Wall Street Journal editorial today. 'Mr. Mueller wasn't obstructed in any way. His copious report ' , copious , 434 pages. Now they want to interview all of the same people again. They want to interview Jerry Nadler, who's been an enemy of mine for many years. He fought me in New York , unsuccessfully, by the way. I've had great success against Jerry. But he was representing Manhattan, and he would fight me all the time on the West Side railroad , many times, very unsuccessfully. He failed. I come to Washington. I've become President. And I said, 'Oh, no, I have Jerry Nadler again?' So Wall Street Journal: 'Mr. Mueller wasn't obstructed in any way. His copious report was released for all to see, and there was no collusion ' , this is the Wall Street Journal , ' and there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.' That's it. But they want to make this a big deal. Whether or not they carry the big 'I' word out , I can't imagine that, but they probably would because they'd do whatever they have to do. I'll tell you, there's a danger here. If someday a Democrat becomes President, and you have a Republican House, they could impeach him for any reason , or her. Any reason. We can't allow that to happen. We can't allow it to happen. So when you look at all of the transparency, when you look at all I've done , and I will tell you, my lawyers say, 'You don't have to do this. You can use presidential privilege. You don't have to let your lawyers and all of your staff testify. You can use presidential privilege, sir.' 'Would you recommend it?' 'Well, you can be transparent or you can be tight. Being , if you've done nothing wrong, being transparent is better.' So I said, 'I did nothing wrong. Let's be transparent.' So that's what you have. All of these things , look at that , all of these things. Five hundred witnesses that I allowed to testify. It's a disgrace. So when they get everything done, I'm all set to , let's get infrastructure. Let's get drug prices down. In the meantime, we're doing tremendous work without them. We're doing tremendous executive orders. A lot of work. We've had a great success. Most successful economy, perhaps, in our country's history. We've cut regulations at a level that nobody else has cut them before. The largest tax cut in the history of the country. So we're doing a lot of work. Steve? Yeah.",

         "Good morning. My fellow Americans, this morning, our nation is overcome with shock, horror, and sorrow. This weekend, more than 80 people were killed or wounded in two evil attacks. On Saturday morning, in El Paso, Texas, a wicked man went to a Walmart store, where families were shopping with their loved ones. He shot and murdered 20 people, and injured 26 others, including precious little children. Then, in the early hours of Sunday morning in Dayton, Ohio, another twisted monster opened fire on a crowded downtown street. He murdered 9 people, including his own sister, and injured 27 others. The First Lady and I join all Americans in praying and grieving for the victims, their families, and the survivors. We will stand by their side forever. We will never forget. These barbaric slaughters are an assault upon our communities, an attack upon our nation, and a crime against all of humanity. We are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil, the cruelty, the hatred, the malice, the bloodshed, and the terror. Our hearts are shattered for every family whose parents, children, husbands, and wives were ripped from their arms and their lives. America weeps for the fallen. We are a loving nation, and our children are entitled to grow up in a just, peaceful, and loving society. Together, we lock arms to shoulder the grief, we ask God in Heaven to ease the anguish of those who suffer, and we vow to act with urgent resolve. I want to thank the many law enforcement personnel who responded to these atrocities with the extraordinary grace and courage of American heroes. I have spoken with Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, as well as Mayor Dee Margo of El Paso, Texas, and Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, to express our profound sadness and unfailing support. Today, we also send the condolences of our nation to President Obrador of Mexico, and all the people of Mexico, for the loss of their citizens in the El Paso shooting. Terrible, terrible thing. I have also been in close contact with Attorney General Barr and FBI Director Wray. Federal authorities are on the ground, and I have directed them to provide any and all assistance required , whatever is needed. The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate. In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart, and devours the soul. We have asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism , whatever they need. We must recognize that the Internet has provided a dangerous avenue to radicalize disturbed minds and perform demented acts. We must shine light on the dark recesses of the Internet, and stop mass murders before they start. The Internet, likewise, is used for human trafficking, illegal drug distribution, and so many other heinous crimes. The perils of the Internet and social media cannot be ignored, and they will not be ignored. In the two decades since Columbine, our nation has watched with rising horror and dread as one mass shooting has followed another , over and over again, decade after decade. We cannot allow ourselves to feel powerless. We can and will stop this evil contagion. In that task, we must honor the sacred memory of those we have lost by acting as one people. Open wounds cannot heal if we are divided. We must seek real, bipartisan solutions. We have to do that in a bipartisan manner. That will truly make America safer and better for all. First, we must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs. I am directing the Department of Justice to work in partisan , partnership with local, state, and federal agencies, as well as social media companies, to develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike. As an example, the monster in the Parkland high school in Florida had many red flags against him, and yet nobody took decisive action. Nobody did anything. Why not? Second, we must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence. We must stop or substantially reduce this, and it has to begin immediately. Cultural change is hard, but each of us can choose to build a culture that celebrates the inherent worth and dignity of every human life. That's what we have to do. Third, we must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment, but, when necessary, involuntary confinement. Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun. Fourth, we must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms, and that, if they do, those firearms can be taken through rapid due process. That is why I have called for red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. Today, I am also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty, and that this capital punishment be delivered quickly, decisively, and without years of needless delay. These are just a few of the areas of cooperation that we can pursue. I am open and ready to listen and discuss all ideas that will actually work and make a very big difference. Republicans and Democrats have proven that we can join together in a bipartisan fashion to address this plague. Last year, we enacted the STOP School Violence and Fix NICS Acts into law, providing grants to improve school safety and strengthening critical background checks for firearm purchases. At my direction, the Department of Justice banned bump stocks. Last year, we prosecuted a record number of firearms offenses. But there is so much more that we have to do. Now is the time to set destructive partisanship aside , so destructive , and find the courage to answer hatred with unity, devotion, and love. Our future is in our control. America will rise to the challenge. We will always have and we always will win. The choice is ours and ours alone. It is not up to mentally ill monsters; it is up to us. If we are able to pass great legislation after all of these years, we will ensure that those who were attacked will not have died in vain. May God bless the memory of those who perished in Toledo. May God protect them. May God protect all of those from Texas to Ohio. May God bless the victims and their families. May God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.",

THEY WANT TO GET RID OF NATURAL GAS. THEY WANT TO GO TO WIND. I JUST CAN'T WATCH THE SHOW TONIGHT, THE WIND STOPPED FLOWING. I CAN'T STOP , WATCH LSU AND FLORIDA. THERE WAS NO WIND TODAY. I'M REALLY ANGRY AT JOHN BEL EDWARDS. HE HAS NOT DONE THE. BEST IN THE JOB. , HE HAS NOT DONE THE JOB. WE ARE RESTORING THE UNRIVALED FIGHT , MIGHT OF THE U.S. , MILITARY LIKE NEVER BEFORE. BY THE WAY, WE WILL INTRODUCE SOME GREAT SENATORS HERE TONIGHT, YOU HAVE GREAT CONGRESSMAN. WE APPROVED SOMETHING CALLED VETERANS TWICE. , CHOICE. THE VETERANS CAN SEE A DOCTOR OUTSIDE OF THE V.A.

THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE VETERANS. THEY WORK FAST. THEY DON'T MESS AROUND IN LOUISIANA, DO THEY? THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE TO SEE IT. OUR POLICE ARE GREAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT, GREAT. FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS, DEMOCRATS HAVE WAGED A NONSTOP BATTLE TO OVERTURN YOUR VOTE, OVERRULE YOUR VOICE, OVERRIDE YOUR VALUES, AND OVERTHROW THE RESULTS OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 2016. YOUR SENATORS AND YOUR CONGRESSMEN, THE REAL SENATORS AND REAL CONGRESSMEN AND WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY, THEY ARE NOT STANDING , THE GOOD PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA WILL NEVER STAND FOR IT. IT'S A HOAX. THE DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING TO RESTORE THE RIGID POLITICAL CLASS THAT THROUGH OPEN OUR NATION'S BORDERS, SHIPPED AWAY OUR JOBS, SACRIFICED OUR WEALTH, SURRENDERED OUR SOVEREIGNTY, FLOODED OUR CITIES WITH DRUGS AND CRIME, AND BOGGED US DOWN IN ONE FOREIGN WAR AFTER ANOTHER. THE ENDLESS WARS HAVE TO STOP. WE ARE DIRECTLY TAKING ON THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE OF CORRUPT DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS, DEEP STATE BUREAUCRATS, AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. THERE THEY ARE RIGHT THERE. IT'S REALLY FUNNY. I SEE ALL THOSE RED LIGHTS. THAT MEANS YOU ARE LIVE, RIGHT? AS SOON AS I START TALKING ABOUT THE FAKE NEWS, I SEE THOSE LIGHTS GO OFF SO FAST. BUT THEN THEY COME BACK ON. YOU KNOW WHY THEY COME BACK ON? LAST NIGHT, BY FAR, ALL OVER CABLE, THE HIGHEST-RATED SHOW WAS WHAT WE DID IN MINNESOTA, A STATE WE ARE GOING TO WIN. THAT'S WHY THEY COME BACK ON. THEY HAVE NO CHOICE. THEY MAY HATE TRUMP BUT THEY WANT TO GET THOSE RATINGS. HEY, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND 12, 16 YEARS WHEN I'M NO LONGER PRESIDENT? THE RATINGS ARE GOING TO TANK. I ACTUALLY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO ENDORSE ME. HE SLIDES INTO THE UKRAINE, HE FLIES INTO UKRAINE, HE WALKS OUT WITH $168,000 A MONTH. $3 MILLION. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT A GASOLINE TANK LOOKS LIKE. THEY ARE PAYING HIM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MONTH. HE SLIDES INTO CHINA AND HE TAKES OUT $1.5 BILLION. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I MADE A GREAT CHINA DEAL TODAY FOR ENERGY, FOR THE FARMERS. FOR THE BANKS. FOR SOME MANY, TECHNOLOGY IS ONE OF THE GREATS. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM, IT WILL BE $50 BILLION IN BOND PURCHASES. I DON'T THINK OUR FARMERS CAN PRODUCE THAT MUCH. I SAID, THAT'S OK. SHOULD WE MAKE IT 20? I SAID, MAKE IT 50. OUR FARMERS WILL BUY MORE LAND AND THEY WILL BUY BIGGER TRACTORS. THEY ACTUALLY SAID, I WANT MY FARMERS. I WANT THEM TO COME BACK. WE CAN PRODUCE THIS, IT'S TOO MUCH. WE CAN'T PRODUCE THAT MUCH. I WANT TO TELL YOU, I GOT CHINA TO ORDER A LOT. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE CHINA, IN THEIR RECORD YEAR, THEY WILL CATCH IT. SHIFT GOT FOUR PINOCCHIO'S FOR MAKING UP WHAT I SAID ON THE PHONE CALL. THE BIGGEST YEAR WAS $60 BILLION IN AGRICULTURAL. THAT'S A LOT OF CORN. 16 BILLION WAS THE BIGGEST YEAR. THEY ARE GOING TO BUY 40-50 BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF AGRICULTURE. MY PEOPLE SAID TO ME, THEY CAN'T DO IT. THEY CANNOT PRODUCE THAT MUCH. I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, MY PEOPLE WANTED TO STOP IT 20. I SAID, I'M NOT STOPPING AT 20. I WANT THEM TO COME BACK AND SAY, SIR, WE CAN'T DO IT. I LOVE MY FARMERS. THEY WILL BE AT THEIR BUSY , OUT THERE. THERE WILL BE MORE TRACTORS SOLD. THEY WILL BE BIGGER AND BETTER AND MORE POWERFUL. THEY WILL BE MADE BY AMERICAN COMPANIES LIKE JOHN DEERE. FOR YOUR SENATORS AND YOUR CONGRESSMAN THAT ARE HERE, THAT WAS ONE HELL OF A DEAL. THIS WAS PHASE ONE. YOU HAVE TO SEIZE THESE , SEE THESE. THEY'RE HAPPY TO DO IT. WE HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. LET ME GET BACK TO BIDEN. RIGHT? HE WALKED OUT OF CHINA. HE WALKS OUT WITH $1.5 BILLION. I SAID, YOU KNOW, THOSE AREN'T THE SAME GUYS I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH FROM CHINA FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. THOSE GUYS DON'T GIVE YOU 1.5 BILLION IF YOU KNOW NOTHING. THAT'S NOT THE SAME CHINESE PEOPLE I WANT TO MEET. INSTEAD OF $50 BILLION, IT WOULD BE $500 BILLION WORTH OF CORN. IT'S A CROOKED DEAL. THE FAKE NEWS IS ALWAYS COVERING IT. RIGHT? THE FAKE NEWS. THEY GO, THE CLAIM IS UNSUBSTANTIATED. WITH ME, AN , ANY CLAIM IS OK. WITH THEM, WHY THE CLAIM IS TOTALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED. I SAY, IT'S NOT UNSUBSTANTIATED. HE TOOK A FORTUNE OUT OF UKRAINE AND DID NOTHING. HE TOOK A FORTUNE OUT OF CHINA. HOW TOUGH IS CHINA? I CALLED ONE OF THE BIGGEST PEOPLE ON WALL STREET. ONE OF MY BIG, POWERFUL GUYS. I SAID, LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF DOING THAT? HE SAID, ZERO. I SAID, YOU ARE THE BIGGEST ON WALL STREET, STEVE. YOU ARE THE BIGGEST. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES YOU CAN DO THAT? HE SAID, EVEN THE BIG ONES CAN'T DO THAT. FOR A GUY TO WALK IN OFF THE STREET WITH NO EXPERIENCE, A BAD TRACK RECORD, JUST GOT THROWN OUT OF THE NAVY. HE WALKS AWAY WITH 1.5 BILLION. THESE CROOKED PEOPLE SAY, THIS IS TOTALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THEY WALKED OUT WITH $1.5 BILLION? THEY WOULDN'T BE SAYING, TOTALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED. THEY WOULD BE SAYING, WHERE'S THE NEAREST CELL? THIS IS A HORRIBLE THING. IT'S A DISGRACE WHAT'S GOING ON. IT'S A WHOLE BIG FAT DISGRACE. IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO REPUBLICANS. YOU KNOW WHY? WE ARE HERE AND THEY ARE NOT. THE DEMOCRATS AND THE MEDIA, THEY ARE PARTNERS. THEY ARE PARTNERS. OK? YOU EVER SEE , WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. THEY ARE SAYING IT'S A MANUFACTURED CRISIS. THEY SAID IT WAS NOT A CRISIS. YOU HAD CARAVAN'S, WE STOPPED IT. THE WALL IS BEING BUILT LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. REMEMBER A FEW MONTHS AGO? A MANUFACTURED CRISIS ON ABC. NBC. ABC AGAIN, MANUFACTURED. CNN, CROOKED AS HELL. A MANUFACTURED CRISIS. CBS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN A MANUFACTURED CRISIS. IT'S A WORD THAT WAS NEVER USED. NOW EVERYTHING ON NETWORK , EVERY SINGLE NETWORK USED IT. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S COLLUSION. IT'S COLLUSION. THAT'S THE REAL COLLUSION. WITH US, THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. THAT'S THE REAL COLLUSION RIGHT THERE. THEY COLLUDED AND THEY CONSPIRED TO SABOTAGE OUR INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT. THEY WANT TO DECEIVE THE AMERICAN VOTER. THEY WANT TO HURT THE AMERICAN VOTER. WE HAD AN ELECTION. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A GREATER VICTORY THAN THE VICTORY WE HAD IN 2016. WE WILL HAVE A BIGGER ONE IN 2020. THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO STOP US FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS WITH A LOT OF CRACK , CR AP. THE FIRST FROM , TIME I HEARD ABOUT RUSSIA, THEY SAID, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RUSSIA? NO. HAVE YOU COLLUDED WITH RUSSIA? I LAUGHED. I THOUGHT THEY WERE KIDDING. SOME OF THE IS CAME UP. THE YOU KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT RUSSIA? NO. I KNOW WHERE IT IS. I DON'T DEAL WITH IT. I TOLD THE GUYS 12 YEARS AGO, HE WAS FROM RUSSIA. I DON'T KNOW. THEY COME UP AGAIN. SIR, RUSSIA KEEPS COMING UP. DINO ANYTHING ABOUT IT? IT'S A WITCHHUNT. THIS IS THE INSURANCE POLICY. THIS WAS THE INSURANCE POLICY. REMEMBER? FROM THE TWO LOVERS. IF SHE DOESN'T WIN, WE HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY. THESE PEOPLE ARE CORRUPT. THESE PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTING. THE TWO LOVERS. THEY PUT IT ON THE FBI SERVER. SO THEIR SPOUSES WOULDN'T FIND OUT. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PUT IT ON THEIR PRIVATE. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL FOR THEM, DID IT? LISA, I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU LISA. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH I CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT. LISA. SHE WILL WIN 100 MILLION. JUST IN CASE, MY DARLING, I LOVE YOU. JUST IN CASE SHE DOESN'T WIN, WE HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY. WE WILL TAKE HIM OUT. HE'S A CORRUPT , THESE ARE CORRUPT PEOPLE, FOLKS. SHE SAID, PETER, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. YOU ARE SO GREAT. I DON'T THINK SHE LOVES HIM TOO MUCH ANYMORE, DO YOU? I HEAR THE WORD IS NOT TOO GOOD. THE WORD IS SHE'S NOT IN LOVE ANYMORE. WE'VE BEEN LIVING THROUGH THIS SO-CALLED INSURANCE POLICY BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE ARE PUTTING A STOP TO THEIR PILLAGING AND PLUNDERING AND HOAXES. THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS POLICIES ARE CRAZY. THE POLITICIANS ARE CORRUPT. THEIR CANDIDATES ARE TERRIBLE. THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T WIN AN ELECTION SO THEY ARE PURSUING AN ILLEGAL, INVALID, AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL BULLSHIT IMPEACHMENT. THEY ARE SCAMMERS AND CON ARTISTS. PERPETRATING HOAXES AND WITCHHUNTS. A MAN LIKE GREG GERRIT, GREAT GUY. HE WROTE A BOOK AND THE BOOK TELLS YOU THE WHOLE STORY. BESTSELLER BOOK. GREAT GUY. SO MANY. SO MANY. HE'S NOT A LAWYER BUT HE'S BETTER THAN THE LAWYERS. HE'S CALLED STREETSMART. SO MANY GREAT PEOPLE. JOHN SULLIVAN HOW ABOUT THESE FRAUDULENT WRITERS OF THE NEW YORK TIMES? THEY HAVE TO GIVE BACK THEIR PULITZER PRIZE. THAT IS A FIX. I JUST WON THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR TALKING ABOUT TRUMP AND RUSSIA. PEOPLE WERE RIGHT, LIKE SEAN HANNITY. RUSH LIMBAUGH. LAURA INGRAHAM AND TUCKER CARLSON. JUDGE JEANINE. AND FRANKLY, THE BEST SHOW BY FAR IN THE MORNING IS FOX AND FRIENDS. HOW ABOUT LOU DOBBS? VARNEY IS GREAT. AND MARIA BARTIROMO. MANY OTHERS. WHY AREN'T THESE PEOPLE GETTING THE REAL FULL OF SURPRISE? THEY WERE RIGHT. THEY CALLED IT RIGHT. THE TIMES, THE WASHINGTON POST, THEY ARE DISHONEST, HORRIBLE. I THINK VERY BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. IT IS A PHONY DEAL. THERE WRITERS GET FULL OF SURPRISES , PULLITZER PRIZES. THE ONES THAT REALLY GOT IT RIGHT GO HOME EMPTY-HANDED. THANK GOD WE HAVE THEM ON OUR SIDE. THANK GOD THAT WE HAVE A THING CALLED SOCIAL MEDIA. WE GET THE WORD OUT. LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER GOTTEN THE WORD OUT BEFORE. IT IS CALLED A WITCHHUNT. THIS STORY OF THE GREATEST MASS DELUSION IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY. THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT KHAN JOBS EVER. WE MUST NEVER LET IT HAPPEN TO ANOTHER PRESIDENT. THEY NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO RELEASE THE TRANSCRIPT OF MY CALL. THE WHISTLEBLOWER WHO WORKS FOR BIDEN. HE COMES OUT WITH A TOTALLY PHONY REPORT ON MY PHONE CALL. THEY NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD RELEASE IT. SO THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE OK. IT SOUNDED HORRIBLE. THAT IS WHY I HAD TO RELEASE IT. THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE CAME OUT AND SAID HE DID NOTHING WRONG. HE GOT ELECTED ON AN ANTICORRUPTION PLATFORM. UKRAINE IS KNOWN UNFORTUNATELY AS A VERY CORRUPT PLACE. THE FAKE NEWS HARDLY PUTS THEM ON. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. NOBODY THOUGHT WE WOULD RELEASE THE CALL. NOBODY KNEW WE HAD A TRANSCRIPT. WHEN I HEARD THE VICIOUSNESS, WORSE THAN THE WHISTLEBLOWER. WHY ARE WE PROTECTING A PERSON THAT TELLS YOU THINGS THAT ARE TRUE? SHIFTY SCHIFF, LITTLE ADAM SCHIFF, I HAVE HAD YOU UP TO HERE. HE COMES OUT AND HE MAKES UP MY CONVERSATION. I WAS WATCHING BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK THAT IS WHAT HE SAID. NERVOUS NANCY. I USED TO THINK SHE LOVES THE COUNTRY, SHE HATES THE COUNTRY. NANCY PELOSI HATES THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SHE WOULD NOT BE DOING THIS. FOREIGN PEOPLE LOOKING AT US, THEY HONESTLY THINK WE ARE NUTS. SHE WAS ANGRY WHEN SHE GOT TO READ THE TRANSCRIPT. THAT IS NOT WHAT SHE WAS TOLD. BUT SHE WAS STUCK. THINK OF A GUY WHO MAKES UP A PHONE CALL. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE THEIR FACES. HE GOES BEFORE CONGRESS AND MAKES UP THE STORY OF WHAT I SAID. HE MADE IT UP. IT WAS FICTION. ARE YOU IMMUNE FROM SOMETHING LIKE THAT? THAT SHOULD BE A CRIME. I NEED YOU TO SEND THE DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT A CLEAR MESSAGE, YOU'RE GOING TO FIRE YOUR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR WHO HAS DONE A LOUSY JOB. AND SUNDAY GREAT REPUBLICAN TO THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION. WHEN JOHN BEL EDWARDS RAN FOR OFFICE, HE MADE YOUR STATE A SACRED PROMISE THAT HE WOULD NOT RAISE YOUR TAXES. THEN HE GOT ELECTED AND BROKE THAT PROMISE BY RAMMING THROUGH THE LARGEST TAX HIKE IN YOUR STATE'S HISTORY. BECAUSE THE STATE LIKES ME, I THINK I ONE BY A LOT. , WON BY A LOT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THE HELL YOU LIKE A GUY. BUT I LIKE YOU GUYS TOO. I USED TO GO TO CONSTRUCTION SITES WHERE PEOPLE WOULD BE PUTTING UP HOUSING. I LIKE THOSE WORKERS. JOHN BEL EDWARDS LIED TO THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA. EDWARDS IS TRYING TO DESTROY LOUISIANA'S ENERGY SECTOR. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? WITH THREATS AND LAWSUITS INSPIRED BY THE RADICAL LEFT-WING DEMOCRATS. THAT IS WHAT HE IS DOING. HE IS NOT GOOD. HE GOES AROUND SAYING HE LIKES ME VERY MUCH. BUT BEHIND MY BACK, HE DOES NOT LIKE ME. HE WAS A SUPERDELEGATE FOR CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON. IT LOOKS LIKE BERNIE LOST HIS CHANCE. BERNIE WAS HITTING A BASEBALL TODAY TO SHOW HOW STRONG HE WAS. THEY'RE JUST THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF BAT SPEED. BERNIE, GET BETTER. IT IS THE ONLY TIME I'VE EVER SAID ANYTHING GOOD ABOUT HIM. BOY DID THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIM FOR YEARS AGO AND THEY LET HIM DO IT. , HE LET THEM DO IT. HE FIGURED HE WOULD WAIT FOR YEARS. WHEN BERNIE GETS OUT, IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE WILL GO TO YOUR RADICAL LEFTISTS ELIZABETH WARREN. THAT WILL BE THE END OF SLEEPY JOE. HE IS WHO I WOULD LIKE TO RUN AGAINST. I DON'T CARE. JUST PUT THEM OUT THERE. LET'S GET THIS THING GOING. OUR FRIEND BRIAN KEMP DID A NUMBER ON STACEY ABRAMS. SHE HAD OPRAH. OPRAH DID A TEST USED TO BE A REALLY BIG FRIEND OF MINE. SHE USED TO GO TO MAR-A-LAGO. SHE LIKES THE KEY LIME PIE. SHE WENT TO GEORGIA AND SHE CAMPAIGNED FOR STACEY ABRAMS. THE OBAMAS WENT. ALL BRIAN KEMP HAD WAS DONALD TRUMP. WE HAD A RALLY AT THE AIRPORT. 55,000 PEOPLE THERE. HE WON BY 2.5 POINTS. THAT WAS AMAZING. EVERY STAR WENT DOWN THERE FOR STACEY ABRAMS. LOUISIANA CANNOT TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR RAISING YOUR TAXES, KILLING YOUR JOBS, ATTACKING YOUR INDUSTRY, AND TAKING MONEY FROM OPEN BORDERS. HOW ABOUT THESE PEOPLE WHO WANT OPEN BORDERS? LET EVERYONE COME IN. TOMORROW YOU HAVE TO VOTE JOHN BEL EDWARDS OUT. AND THE WAY YOU DO THAT IS BEFORE THE GAME, YOU GOT TO GET GOING. JUST LEAVE AN HOUR EARLY. MAYBE AN HOUR EARLY. IT IS A RUNOFF. IF HE DOES NOT GET 50%, THEN ONE OF OUR TWO GREAT CANDIDATES WILL WIN. IT WILL BE JOHN BEL EDWARDS AGAINST ONE OF OUR TWO GREAT CANDIDATES. THEY ARE BOTH GREAT PEOPLE. THEY ARE BOTH PRO-JOBS, PRO-WORKERS, PROFAMILY, PRO-LIFE. AND PRO-LOUISIANA ENERGY. IF THAT IS OK. I WAS HERE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND THEY OPENS THE BIGGEST LNG PLANT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS THING APPROVED FOR YEARS. I GOT THOSE PERMITS SO FAST FOR THEM. THESE BIG ENERGY EXECUTIVES WERE SITTING BACK AND THEY COULD NOT GET IT APPROVED. NOTHING THEY COULD DO. YOUR GOVERNOR WAS LOUSY. NO ONE COULD HELP. THAT THING WAS SO DEAD. I CAME ALONG AND GOT IT APPROVED. CONSULTANTS CALLED UP THESE BIG ENERGY EXECUTIVES. WE WERE ABLE TO GET IT APPROVED. I NEVER SAW THESE PEOPLE. I KNOW IT WAS A GOOD THING. THEY PROBABLY GOT MILLIONS IN CONSULTING FEES. I WOULD RATHER GIVE IT TO YOU PEOPLE. OR CHARITY. BUT IT CAME ALONG. NOBODY KNOWS CONSULTANTS BETTER THAN ME. THEY MAKE THE ENVIRONMENTAL RULES TOUGH. YOU HAVE TO PAY THEM A LOT OF MONEY TO SKIRT YOUR WAY THROUGH. IT TAKES YEARS AND YEARS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS. I GOT THAT PLANT APPROVED AND I CAME DOWN TWO MONTHS AGO. I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO BIG. NOW THEY GOING TO DOUBLE IT UP. THEY WILL PROTECT YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. OUR TWO GUYS. EDWARDS WON'T. WHEN IT GETS CLOSE AND THEY START CALLING FROM WASHINGTON AND SCHUMER AND PELOSI CALL, WE WANT TO TO GET RID OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT, HE IS 100% GOING TO DROP THE SECOND AMENDMENT. YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE. JOHN BEL EDWARDS WILL NOT PROTECT YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. OUR GUYS SUPPORT YOUR POLICE. THEY DEFEND THE GREAT WORKERS AND FAMILIES OF THE STATE. IF YOU WANT TO GOVERNOR WHO WILL FIGHT FOR YOUR VALUES, GET OUT TOMORROW AND CAST YOUR BALLOT. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. , FEAR , COME UP HERE. HERE IS THE PROBLEM. WE ARE ON LIVE TELEVISION ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY DON'T LIKE THIS. THEY SAY PUT TRUMP BACK ON. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HIT YOUR REPUBLICAN OPPONENT. YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO HIT JOHN BEL EDWARDS BECAUSE HE DESERVES IT. GO AHEAD. IS THIS INCREDIBLE? WE NEED SOMEONE TO DO FOR LOUISIANA WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE FOR THE USA. WE NEED A CONSERVATIVE. A BUSINESSMAN. SOMEONE WHO IS NOT BEHOLDEN TO SPECIAL INTERESTS. SOMEONE WHO WILL FIGHT FOR LOUISIANA. THAT IS WHY I AM IN THIS RACE. LET'S GO GET IT. LET'S FIRE JOHN BEL EDWARDS. LET'S THANK OUR PRESIDENT FOR COMING DOWN HERE TO HELP US. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT FOR COMING TO LOUISIANA AND MAKING LOUISIANA GREAT AGAIN. MR. PRESIDENT, WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS. FOR REBUILDING OUR MILITARY. AND FOR PROTECTING OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. I DROPPED A RESOLUTION TO EXPEL NANCY PELOSI FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. GO AMERICA GO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU HAVE TO DO IT TOMORROW. GET A RUNOFF. VOTE TOMORROW FOR THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN TICKET. WE ARE ALSO DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED BY TWO REALLY GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE. THESE ARE WARRIORS. DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE BUT EQUALLY THEY FIGHT FOR YOU AND THEY LOVE THE STATE AND THEY LOVE THIS COUNTRY. ONE HAS A STRANGE NAME. HE CALLED ME UP. THEY SAID THERE IS A MAN NAMED JOHMNN KENNEDY ON THE PHONE. HE IS RUNNING FOR THE SENATE IN A STATE THAT LIKES YOU A LOT. I SAID WHERE? LOUISIANA. I SAID LET ME CHECK IT OUT. IT IS TRUE. VERY SUCCESSFUL GUY. BRILLIANT GUY. I AM A BIG STUDENT. I LIKE ACADEMICS. MY UNCLE WAS A PROFESSOR FOR 35 YEARS AT M.I.T. HE WENT TO OXFORD. THAT IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS. HE WAS A GREAT STUDENT AT OXFORD. HE PUTS ON THAT COUNTRY STUFF ALL THE TIME. WE KNOW THE COUNTRY IS SMARTER THAN THE OTHER GUY ANYWAY. JOHN KENNEDY SAYS, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT. I SAID, TO ME YOU ARE THE REAL CHINA KENNEDY, YOU ARE THE REAL DEAL. IT WAS A FRIDAY NIGHT AND THERE WAS THIS MASSIVE AIRPLANE HANGAR SOMEPLACE. IT WAS SOMEWHERE IN YOUR GREAT STATE. WE HAD THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SHOW UP. I LOOKED AT HIM AND I LIKED HIM AND I LOOKED AT THAT CROWD AND SAID, I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO WIN TOMORROW. THE ELECTION WAS ON A SATURDAY. JOHN KENNEDY WON BY A LOT. IT WAS A GREAT THING FOR OUR COUNTRY. WHERE IS JOHN KENNEDY? COME HERE. WE HAVE ANOTHER GUY. ANYTIME I TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE , ANYTIME I WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MEDICAL, TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE, I CALL A MAN NAMED BILL CASSIDY. HE IS INCREDIBLE. WHAT A HEART. , ON A PEER, JOHN. , COME ON UP HERE, JOHN. OXFORD! EARLIER I GAVE HIM A QUIZ. I IMAGINED YOU WERE RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN. AND I ASKED HIM, WHO IS MORE LIKELY TO SECURE THE SOUTHERN BORDER? BUT THERE WAS ONE QUESTION I FORGOT TO ASK. WHO PROMISED TO BUILD A NEW RIVER BRIDGE? TWO GREAT MEN. TWO GREAT AMERICANS. ANOTHER MAN WHO IS VERY BRAVE. HE WAS IN BAD CONDITION. I WAS AT THE HOSPITAL THE NIGHT HE WAS EXPECTED TO DIE. HE WAS NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD THAT NIGHT. I WENT THERE AND THE DOCTOR SAID, IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SAVE HIM. I THINK HE IS BETTER LOOKING NOW THAN HE WAS TWO YEARS AGO. THE GREATEST THING, HE WAS PLAYING BASEBALL. HE WAS SHOT WHILE THEY WERE PRACTICING. STEVE SCALISE. HE IS RECOVERING. I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO IT. HE HAD A LOT OF DAMAGE. HE WENT OUT AND HE PLAYED IN THE BASEBALL GAME SIX MONTHS LATER. THE FIRST BATTER HITS A GROUNDBALL RIGHT AT HIM. I SAID THIS IS GOING TO BE TERRIBLE. HE GOT DOWN AND HE GOT THAT PAUL AND HE CAUGHT IT. AND HE THREW TO FIRST. HE COULD BARELY THROW. HE THREW IT TO FIRST ON THE BATTER WAS OUT. THAT WAS A MIRACLE. THE FIRST PITCH OF THE GAME. HOW TOUGH IS THAT? I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STOP THAT SUCKER. HE IS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE AND HE IS ANOTHER ONE. HE LOVES YOU SO MUCH. HE IS REALLY A BRAVE GUY. STEVE SCALISE. AND THEN WE HAVE SOME OTHER GREAT WARRIORS, GREAT CONGRESSMEN. COME ON UP, FELLAS. THANK YOU. THEY ARE WARRIORS. THEY MAKE BETTER , OUR LIVES BETTER ON WASHINGTON. YOU HAVE AN AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER WELL KNOWN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AN INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. THANK YOU. AND SOLICITOR GENERAL. THANK YOU. NICE HAT. WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PRESIDENTS AND PEOPLE HAVE SAID YOU NEEDED. ALL THE WORK IS DONE. IT IS GETTING READY FOR FINAL APPROVALS. THAT IS THE HARD PART IN MANY CASES. IT IS ALL DONE. WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD THE I-10 RIVER BRIDGE. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD IT. FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME THE WINNERS OF THE 2019 LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONSHIP. LOUISIANA SEGARRA , LOUISIANA'S OWN. IT DRIVES ME CRAZY HOW GOOD-LOOKING THEY ARE. LOOK AT THEM. STAY THERE FOR A SECOND. I AM IN THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY AND WE HAD THE LITTLE LEAGUE GIRLS CHAMPIONSHIP. THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. THEY COME FROM NORTH CAROLINA. THEY WERE UNDEFEATED. THEY WERE INCREDIBLE. THEY HAD A TREMENDOUS TEAM. NORTH CAROLINA. THE GUYS CAME IN AND I SAID, WHERE YOU FROM? THEY SAID, LOUISIANA. ONE GUY THROWS THE BALL 75 MILES PER HOUR. I THINK HE IS BEING RECRUITED BY THE ENTIRE MAJOR LEAGUES ALREADY. HE IS 12 YEARS OLD. I SAY, WHERE YOU FROM. THEY SAID LOUISIANA. I SAID I'M GOING ON A BEAUTIFUL PLANE CALLED AIR FORCE ONE. THE WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL PLANE. I AM GOING TO A PLACE CALLED LOUISIANA. DO YOU WANT TO CALM , COME? THEY LOOKED AT THEIR PARENTS. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE THEIR PARENTS. THEY WON THE WHOLE DEAL ALL OVER THE WORLD. THEY ARE THE NUMBER ONE TEAM. SOMEBODY TOLD ME THEY STARTED OFF WITH THOUSANDS OF TEAMS ALL OVER THE WORLD. I GOT SO USED TO WATCHING JAPAN WIN. IT WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE CONTROVERSIAL. HE IS 12 BUT HE SEEMS TO BE 18. I AM ONLY KIDDING. HE IS A FRIEND OF MINE. HE WILL UNDERSTAND THE WAY I KID. JAPAN ALWAYS DID GREAT. THIS YEAR, YOU HAVE THE WORLD CHAMPIONS OF LITTLE LEAGUE. FROM LOUISIANA. CONGRATULATIONS. COME ON UP HERE, KIDS. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. I JUST SAID, DOES ANYBODY WANT TO SAY SOMETHING. THEY SAID NO. YOU AND I KNOW THEY DO NOT CHOKE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD CHOKE MEANS. WHERE IS THIS BIG PICTURE? COME UP HERE. I WANT TO REPRESENT THE SKY. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY REPRESENTING HIM. ARE YOU READY FOR THE MAJOR LEAGUES SOMEDAY? WHAT ARE YOU THROWING? DID YOU DO PRETTY WELL? YOU KEPT THEM PRETTY WELL SET OUT. THEY COULD NOT SEE THE BAR , BALL. 8-0. YOU DID NOT PITCH A BAD GAME. GO GET 'EM, KIDS. THANKS, FELLAS. I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO LEAVE. CHAMPIONS. THERE IS NO CHOKE. THEY DON'T CHOKE AND WE DON'T CHUG. WE DON'T LIKE CHOKERS. WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE HERE TONIGHT, AMERICA IS BOOMING AGAIN. WE ARE WINNING. WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. YOU HAVE NOT HEARD THAT IN A LONG TIME. 7 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF OF FOOD STAMPS SINCE OUR GREAT ELECTION. UNEMPLOYMENT JUST REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE IN OVER 50 YEARS. UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANIC AMERICANS, AND ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE HIT THE ALL-TIME LOWEST RATES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WAGES ARE RISING FAST. FEWER CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY TODAY WHEN I WAS SELECTED. I HAVE CUT A RECORD NUMBER OF JOB KILLING REGULATIONS. OVER $1 TRILLION HAS BEEN BROUGHT BACK IN AND IS BEING SPENT BUILDING IN THE UNITED STATES INSTEAD OF BUILDING OVERSEAS. THE DEMOCRATS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAVE PLEDGED TO ABOLISH ALL AMERICAN PRODUCTION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THAT IS WONDERFUL. DEMOCRATS ARE PROMISING TO ANNIHILATE LOUISIANA'S ECONOMY. WE ARE NEVER GOING TO LET THEM DO THAT. ONE OF YOUR SENATORS JUST SET IT. I CAME HERE TO GET YOU TO GO OUT TO VOTE. ONE OF YOUR SENATORS TOLD ME, YOU NEVER HAVE TO GO BACK TO LOUISIANA. GO TO THOSE STATES THAT ARE CLOSE. MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA. WE ABSOLUTELY WON THOSE STATES BY SO MUCH NOBODY EVER SAW IT COMING. I DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION. IT WAS THE SAME KIND OF AN ARENA. IT WAS PACKED. THAT WAS NORTH CAROLINA. WE WON PENNSYLVANIA LAST TIME. THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS. WE WON MICHIGAN. WE WON SOUTH CAROLINA. FLORIDA. AND WISCONSIN. WE HAVE TO GET NANCY TO APPROVE THE USMCA. WE CALL THEM THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS. WE WILL DO IT AFTER WE TAKE OVER THE HOUSE. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION BETRAYED OUR NATION ENERGY WORKERS. NOW WE ARE PROUDLY PROMOTING AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. WE ARE INDEPENDENT. I APPROVED THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE AND THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE. 48,000 JOBS. MY FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE. I SIGNED EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO SPEED UP THE CONSTRUCTION OF CRITICAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND I OPENED UP AND WARM , ANWAR, THE LARGEST DRILLING SITE ANYWHERE. IT IS IN ALASKA. THEY COULD NOT GET IT DONE. EVEN RONALD REAGAN COULD NOT GET IT DONE. WE GOT IT DONE. WE ENDED DECADES OF RUINOUS TRADE POLICIES THAT RANSACKED THE COMMUNITIES OF THE STATE. LOUISIANA LOST ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS AFTER THE TWIN DISASTERS OF NAFTA AND CHINA'S ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION. PROBABLY THE WORST TRADE DEAL EVER MADE. WE ARE REPLACING NAFTA WITH THE BRAND-NEW U.S.-MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT. IT WILL BE A MASSIVE VICTORY FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND GROWERS AND WORKERS. THEY MAY SAY WE CANNOT DO ANYMORE. WE DON'T WANT ANYMORE. THEY WILL BE CALLING ME FROM NEBRASKA. FROM IOWA. WE ARE WINNING SO MUCH. PLEASE, MR. PRESIDENT. WE DON'T WANT TO WIN SO MUCH. WE ARE NOT USED TO IT. THEY WILL BE CALLING ME FROM NEBRASKA. FROM IOWA. IF THERE WAS HONEST VOTING, I DO THINK I WOULD'VE ONE THAT AS WELL. BUT THERE IS NOT. WHATEVER THEY TELL YOU, THERE IS NOT. THEY WILL BE SAYING WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE. IT IS NOT A NICE FEELING? DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK AND PASS THE USMCA. WE HAVE TAKEN THE TOUGHEST ACTION EVER TO CONFRONT CHINA'S DECADES OF ABUSE AND NOW WE ARE GETTING ALONG WITH CHINA. THIS WAS A GREAT DAY I WAS ALMOST LATE FOR YOU BECAUSE I WAS WITH CHINA. I SAID I AM NOT GOING TO BE LATE FOR LOUISIANA EVEN IF IT MEANS STANDING UP CHINA. IT WAS BETWEEN LOUISIANA AND CHINA. I HAD TO PICK LOUISIANA. TODAY I WAS WITH THE VICE PREMIER OF CHINA. ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MEN IN THE WORLD. WE MADE THAT SIGNIFICANT PROCESS , PROGRESS. THEY WANT IT BADLY. IT WILL END THE MISTREATMENT OF AMERICAN WORKERS AND COMPANIES IT WILL BE GREAT FOR CHINA TOO. WE WILL NOT REST UNTIL WE ACHIEVE ECONOMIC FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER AND AMERICAN PEOPLE. DEMOCRATS HAVE PUT THE NEEDS OF FOREIGN CITIZENS AHEAD OF OUR OWN. WE PROTECT BORDERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. WE DON'T PROTECT OUR OWN BORDERS. YOU SEE THE NUMBERS. THEY HAVE PLUMMETED. 27,000. THINK OF IT. JUST BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WOULD NOT APPROVE SIMPLE CHANGES MEXICO HAS HELPED US MORE ON OUR BORDER THAN THE DEMOCRATS. ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS THIS BULLISHNESS. PEOPLE SEE THEIR GAME. THE VOTERS ARE SMART. IN A RECENT DEBATE, EVERY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RAISE THEIR HAND IN FAVOR OF GIVING FREE GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS. YOU WONDER WHY THEY COME TO AMERICA. WHY WOULDN'T THEY COME? FREE EVERYTHING. I DID IT AGAIN. I WAS JUST KIDDING. THE DEMOCRATIC VISION FOR AMERICA IS TO ROB AMERICAN TAXPAYERS TO FUND SOCIALISM FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD. IF YOU DON'T WANT DEMOCRATS TO RAID YOUR HEALTH CARE, STEAL YOUR MONEY, OVERCROWD YOUR SCHOOLS, AND OVERWHELM YOUR COMMUNITIES, THEN YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE. YOU HAVE TO GO OUT TOMORROW AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. GET JOHN BEL EDWARDS THE HELL OUT OF OFFICE. I NEVER FORGET THAT I AM NOT PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD. I AM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE REJECT GLOBALISM. WE EMBRACE PATRIOTISM. WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN DESERVES A GOVERNMENT THAT IS LOYAL TO THEM. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND THE EXTREME RADICAL LEFT ARE TRYING TO ABOLISH THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CITIZENS AND NONCITIZENS. IN MANY CASES, PEOPLE WHO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY WERE TREATED BETTER THAN OUR VETS. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF GREAT VETS. PEOPLE WHO WERE COMING IN ILLEGALLY WERE TREATED BETTER THAN THEM. NOT ANYMORE. JUST RECENTLY, NEW YORK CITY, I LOVE NEW YORK CITY, WE HAVE SOME REAL BAD LEADERSHIP OVER THERE. THE MAYOR RAN FOR PRESIDENT. HE GOT ZERO. HOW DO YOU GET ZERO? IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. THERE HAS TO BE ONE STRANGE PERSON OUT THERE. HE GOT ZERO. NEW YORK WANTED HIM TO DO SO WELL. THEY DID NOT WANT HIM BACK AS MAYOR. THEY WOULD HAVE SAID LET HIM BE PRESIDENT, JUST KEEP THEM THE HELL AWAY FROM NEW YORK. HE ISSUED A RULE THAT THE USE OF THE TERM ILLEGAL ALIEN CAN NOW BE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF UP TO $250,000. CAN YOU IMAGINE? YOU ARE A HARD WORKER AND YOU'RE SAVING YOUR MONEY. YOU JUST BUILT UP THAT MONEY AFTER YEARS OF CONSTRUCTION WORK. YOU ARE RICH. YOU FEEL BETTER THAN TRUMP EVER DID. YOU HAPPEN TO, AND ONE OF THOSE BAD MOMENTS, USE THE WORD ILLEGAL ALIEN. THEY SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GIVE ME THAT MONEY YOU WORKED YOUR ASS OFF FOR. THEIR ATTACK ON FREE SPEECH GOES HAND-IN-HAND WITH THEIR ATTACK ON AMERICA'S BORDERS. THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS ARE SOFT ON AMERICAN FREEDOM AND AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP. DEMOCRATS ALSO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE FOREIGN INTERVENTION IN OUR ELECTIONS BY REFUSING TO SUPPORT A SIMPLE AND BEAUTIFUL THING CALLED VOTER ID. MAYBE I CAN ASK OUR SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN. IT IS SO POPULAR. IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND BUY GROCERIES, YOU NEED IDENTIFICATION. ALMOST ANYTHING. THE ONLY THING YOU DON'T NEED IDENTIFICATION FOR IS TO VOTE. THEY CHEAT LIKE HELL. THAT IS WHY. MAYBE THEY COULD PUT OUT A VOTER ID. YOU GUYS BELIEVE IN THAT, DON'T YOU? THEY COULD PUT IT OUT. THAT IS WHY I LOVE THIS STATE. NOW I KNOW WHY I WON THE STATE. PEOPLE CANNOT CHEAT. I LOVE THIS STATE. IT IS SO GREAT. DON'T CHANGE. PUT IT OUT FOR EVERY OTHER STATE. MOST STATES DON'T HAVE IT. WE BELIEVE AMERICANS SHOULD VOTE IN ELECTIONS. YOU GO OUT TO CALIFORNIA AND YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING OUT THERE, IT IS A DISGRACE. DEMOCRATS ACCEPT SANCTUARY CITIES. THEY RELEASE VIOLENT CRIMINAL ALIENS ONTO YOUR STREETS. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR CITIES SHOULD BE SANCTUARIES FOR LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS. LAST NIGHT'S THEY HAD TRUMP LOVES COPS. AND COPS LOVE TRUMP. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN SO FAR OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM. THEY HAVE GONE CRAZY. THEY ARE PEOPLE. THEY ARE CRAZED LUNATICS. EVERY DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS PUSHED A HEALTH CARE AGENDA THAT WOULD AND MEDICARE AS WE KNOW IT. WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT MEDICARE FOR OUR BELOVED SENIORS. AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE WILL PROTECT YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE. WHO HAS PRIVATE INSURANCE? HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF THE TICKET AWAY? , TOOK IT AWAY? WE HAVE TAKEN SWIFT ACTION TO LOWER THE PRICE OF HEALTH CARE FOR WORKING FAMILIES. WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. THE MOST UNPOPULAR, UNFAIR THING . THAT IS WHEN YOU PAY A FORTUNE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF NOT HAVING TO PAY A FORTUNE. YOU ARE PAYING TO NOT HAVE TO PAY. IT IS TERRIBLE. I GOT RID OF IT. IT IS A BIG DEAL. THAT WAS NOT EASY. OUR AMBITIOUS CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS PRODUCED THE LARGEST DECLINE IN DRUG PRICES AND MORE THAN 50 YEARS. WE ARE BRINGING THEM DOWN MUCH LOWER. WE ARE GOING TO GIVE OUR STATES, THE DRUG INDUSTRY HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL WIRED. DRUGS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. IN OTHER COUNTRIES, YOU CAN BUY THE EXACT SAME DRUG FOR 70% LESS. SAME DRUG, SAME FACTORY, SAME COMPANY. I JUST GAVE THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA AND I'M GIVING OTHER GOVERNORS THE RIGHT TO GO TO CANADA AND OTHER COUNTRIES TO BUY THE DRUGS. THEY PAY MUCH LESS. WE ARE GIVING STATES THE RIGHTS TO GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND MAKE A DEAL ON DRUGS. IT IS EASIER THAN GOING THROUGH THIS HORRIBLE SYSTEM WHERE THE DEMOCRATS REFUSED TO ALLOW YOU TO DO ANYTHING TO CUT THE PRICE OF DRUGS. THEY DON'T WANT TO LET YOU DO IT. TO HELP PATIENTS WITH LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS, WE PASSED RIGHTS TO TRY. IF YOU ARE TERMINALLY ILL, VERY SICK, WE HAVE THE BEST DOCTORS AND LABS AND TECHNICIANS IN THE WORLD. THEY HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. YOU COULD NOT GET IT. YOU ARE TERMINALLY ILL. YOU'RE GOING TO BE AROUND FOR FOUR WEEKS. WE CAN'T GIVE YOU THIS DRUG. IT MAY HURT YOU. FOR 50 YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET IT. I DID IT PRETTY QUICKLY. I SAID WE WILL DO THESE DISCLOSURES THAT SAY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SUE THE GOVERNMENT OR THE DRUG COMPANY. BUT PEOPLE SAY, IT IS A MIRACLE. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAVED. IT IS INCREDIBLE. THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT SIX YEARS. THEY WILL BE GONE. EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT ALSO NOW SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THAT IS WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTION, SOCIALISM, AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, FAMILY, DREAM. THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT. REPUBLICANS WANT THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE HAVE CONFIRMED 100 , PEOPLE DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THIS, RECORD STUFF, OBAMA GAVE ME 142 FEDERAL JUDGES. I FIGURED IT WAS NONE. I SAID, YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING. WITHIN TWO MONTHS WE WILL HAVE ABOUT 100. OUR HISTORIC INVESTMENT AND REBUILDING THE MILITARY HAS INCLUDED $25 MILLION FOR A PLACE CALLED BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE. EVER HEAR OF IT? RIGHT HERE IN LOUISIANA. $40 MILLION TO NAVAL AIR STATION JOINT RESERVE BASE NEW ORLEANS. OUR WARRIORS HAVE MORE AMMUNITION, MISSILES, ROCKETS, TANKS, FIGHTER JETS, EVERYTHING OUR TROOPS NEED TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY THAN WE HAVE EVER HAD BEFORE. IT IS ALL MADE IN THE USA. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE PUTTING A STOP TO THE ENDLESS WARS. WE HAVE TO BRING OUR FOLKS BACK HOME. WARS GOING ON FOR 19 YEARS. WE ARE POLICE AGENTS. WE ARE NOT FIGHTING WARS. WE CAN'T DO IT. NOT FAIR. OTHER COUNTRIES SHOULD HELP US. THEY DON'T TREAT US RIGHT BUT THEY ARE STARTING TO. ONE OF THE MIDDLE EAST , GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS ONE OF THE BEST , WORST DECISIONS EVER MADE. IT IS LIKE QUICKSAND. WE SPENT A TRILLION DOLLARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BUT THEN WE WANT TO FIX UP A BRIDGE AND THEY SAY, SIR, THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY. WE ARE SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY BRINGING OUR GREAT SOLDIERS AND WARRIORS BACK HOME. AFTER DECADES OF REBUILDING FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR OWN COUNTRY. FOR YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOUR POLITICIANS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. NOT SO LONG AGO. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA. THE PATH TO VICTORY BEGINS WITH A GIANT WIN TOMORROW HERE IN THE GREAT STATE OF LOUISIANA. WITH YOUR SUPPORT, WE WILL SHOW THE CORRUPT DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT BACKING DOWN. WE WILL NEVER, EVER FORGET. WE WILL SEND A TERRIFIC NEW REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR TO BATON ROUGE. TOMORROW, BEFORE THE GAME, GET YOUR FRIENDS, FAMILY, NEIGHBORS, GET OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. THESE ARE TWO GREAT PEOPLE. GET OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR GREAT CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK. FROM DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE. FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. TOGETHER, WE WILL ELECT MORE REPUBLICANS TO CONGRESS TO CREATE AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS AMERICAN JOBS, WAGES, FAMILIES. WE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL MEXICO AND THEIR GREAT 27,000 SOLDIERS WHO ARE DOING THIS AS A FAVOR TO YOUR PRESIDENT, WE ARE NOT PAYING FOR IT, WE WILL TELL THEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOUR SERVICES ARE NO LONGER NEEDED. WE WILL ENACT TRADE DEALS THAT RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THE FOUR BEAUTIFUL WORDS, MADE IN AMERICA. WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE. FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCERS. AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA. YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS WILL BE DONE. IT WILL BE ENDED IN 10 YEARS. WE HAVE THE MEDICINES TO DO IT. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? IT COULD HAVE BEEN STARTED A LONG TIME AGO AND THEY DID NOT DO IT BUT I AM DOING IT. 10 YEARS, THE AIDS EPIDEMIC WILL BE ENDED. WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT WE COULD DO THAT? WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, FREE ASSEMBLY, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. AND ABOVE ALL, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICA. WE SUPPORT, PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. WE STAND WITH THE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY ARE GREAT. I HOPE THEY KNOW HOW MUCH WE CHERISH THEM, AND I THINK THEY DO. WE SAW IT LAST NIGHT IN MINNESOTA. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK IN THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT, BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND TO ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. AND HERE IN LOUISIANA AND ALL ACROSS THIS LAND, WE LIVE BY THE WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, AND GOD WE TRUST. THAT WILL NEVER BE TAKEN AWAY. WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO CROSSED THE OCEANS, SETTLED A CONTINENT, TAMED THE WILDERNESS, REVOLUTIONIZED INDUSTRY, PIONEERED SCIENCE, WON TWO WORLD WARS, DEFEATED FASCISM AND COMMUNISM, AND WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT SOCIALISM AND PUT A MAN ON THE FACE OF THE MOON. PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY, AND TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WITH YOUR HELP, DEVOTION AND DRIVE, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING, AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. WE ARE ONE MOVEMENT, ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY AND ONE GLORIOUS NATURE AND , GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD. AMERICA IS THRIVING LIKE NEVER BEFORE, AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF LOUISIANA, THE BEST IS YET TO COME. GET OUT AND VOTE TOMORROW. TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU, LOUISIANA. GET OUT AND VOTE TOMORROW. THANK YOU.",

         "THANK YOU VERY MUCH, I APPRECIATE IT. AND, HELLO ROCHESTER, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, FOUR DAYS FROM NOW WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. AND, I DID NOT FORGET YOU, BECAUSE WE WERE GIVEN A HARD TIME BY YOUR SO-CALLED LEADERS, BUT THEY ARE NOT VERY GOOD LEADERS AS YOU FOUND OUT. DURING THE RIOTS, AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOUR MORE YEARS IN OUR GREAT, WHITE HOUSE. THANK YOU. AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE AT LEAST 25,000 PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BE HERE TONIGHT. WE JUST SAW A LOT OF THEM. WE WANTED TO PAY OUR RESPECTS. THEY WERE HERE FOR A LONG TIME, THEY WAITED, AND IN THE GOVERNOR DID BAD THINGS. YOUR FAR-LEFT DEMOCRAT ATTORNEY GENERAL, KEITH ELLISON, AND YOUR DEMOCRAT DOVE , GOVERNOR TRIED TO SHUT DOWN OUR RALLY, SILENCE THE PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, AND TAKE AWAY YOUR FREEDOM, AND YOUR RIGHTS. , THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD CANCEL, A WORD THEY ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH, CANCEL CULTURE. I SAID NO, I WOULD NEVER ABANDON THE PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA. I WILL NOT. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER THERE WITH CARS, WE FLEW OVER CARS, THEY GO MILES LONG. WHAT A SHAME. THEY WAITED HERE FOR A LONG TIME. I WANTED TO THANK THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE THAT WERE BARRED FROM ENTRY BY RADICAL DEMOCRATS, YOU ARE AMERICAN PATRIOTS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHEN LARGE NUMBERS OF RIOTERS AND VANDALS SACKED THE CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS EARLIER THIS YEAR, KEITH ELLISON DID NOT ASK THEM TO SUBMIT A PERMIT, HE TOLD THE THRONGS OF VIOLENCE DEMONSTRATORS, BY ALL MEANS, EXERCISE YOUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. HE SAID THAT. PRIOR TO THEM RIPPING DOWN YOUR CITY. KEITH ELLISON SIDED WITH FLAGBURNING EXTREMISTS OVER LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS. HE TREATS YOU LIKE SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. HE BELIEVES THAT THE PRO-AMERICAN VOTERS HAVE FEWER RIGHTS THAN ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATORS. KEITH ELLISON AND JOE BIDEN WANTS TO IMPRISON YOU IN YOUR HOMES WHILE LETTING ANARCHISTS, AGITATORS, AND VANDALS ROAM FREE AS THEY DESTROY YOUR CITIES AND STATES. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY ONCE YOU TO BE BANNED FROM PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY WHILE THEY ALLOW THEIR SUPPORTERS TO BURN DOWN A POLICE RIGHT HERE. BY THEN AND THE FAR-LEFT INCITE VIOLENCE WITH THEY ARE ANTI-POLICE RHETORIC , THEY ARE VILE ANTI-POLICE RHETORIC. THEY ALLOW RIOTERS TO LAY WASTE TO THE PUBLIC STREETS THAT THEY WERE FINANCED , AND THEY WERE FINANCED BY YOU WITH YOUR HARD-EARNED TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THE RADICAL LEFT IS DETERMINED TO OBLITERATE THE MIDDLE-CLASS. THEY THINK THEY CAN INDOCTRINATE YOUR CHILDREN AND SILENCE YOUR VOICES. BUT ON NOVEMBER 3, I HOPE YOU ARE LISTENING MINNESOTA, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE HAD TO PUT UP WITH FOR A LONG TIME. THE PEOPLE OF OUR NATION ARE GOING TO BE HEARD LIKE NEVER BEFORE. IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN. PEOPLE ARE ALREADY STARTING TO FIND OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO SHOW UP AND VOTE IN RECORD NUMBERS. YOU HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. AND THEY ARE GETTING VERY CONCERNED. THEY BAN YOU FROM GOING TO CHURCH WHILE THEY LET LEFT-WING EXTREMISTS BURNED DOWN THE CHURCH , BURNED DOWN THE CHURCH. WHILE THEIR OWN JOBS REMAIN TOTALLY EXEMPT. THEY KEEP YOUR KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL WHILE THEIR FAMILIES HIRE PRIVATE TUTORS. THEY FLOOD YOUR STREETS WITH ILLEGAL DRUGS AND GANGS WHILE THEY LIVE IN WALLED OFF COMPOUNDS. THEY WANT TO DESTROY AND WORK HARD TO DESTROY THE SUBURBS, WHICH I'M PROTECTING. AND TERMINATING HORRIBLE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT ONLY PERTAIN TO THE SUBURBS, WHILE THEY MOVE INTO GATED COMMUNITIES WITH ARMED GUARDS. THESE WEALTHY LIBERAL HYPOCRITES WANT TO DEFUND THE POLICE AND TAKE YOUR GUNS. WHILE THEY ARE PROTECTED BY ARMED GUARDS. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO DEFEND YOUR DIGNITY. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO DEFEND YOUR FAMILY AND COUNTRY. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO PRESERVE, PROTECT, AND DEFEND THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE. YOU MUST SHOW UP AND VOTE ON NOVEMBER 3. IN A SECOND TERM WE WILL INCREASE FUNDING FOR LAW FOR SPENT, WE WILL HIRE MORE , FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT,. WE WILL FINISH AND WIN THE WAR AGAINST MS 13 KILLERS. WE HAVE TAKEN THOUSANDS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. WE WILL PUT THEM ALL OUT OF BUSINESS. WE WILL COMPLETELY DISMANTLE ANTIFA. AND WE WILL RECLAIM OUR STREETS FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS OF EVERY RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, AND CREED. THESE ARE STREETS THAT HAVE BEEN RUN BY DEMOCRATS, NOT REPUBLICANS. IT HAS TAKEN TOO LONG OR THEM TO GAIN CONTROL OF THOSE STREETS. WE WILL DO ALL OF THIS AND SO MUCH MORE. ONLY WITH YOUR VOTE. YOU HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT VOTE. THIS STATE IN PARTICULAR. 1972. THIS IS A STATE, YOU HAVE BEEN POORLY RUN FOR TOO LONG. YOU WANT LAW AND ORDER ALSO. ON NOVEMBER 3, JOE , VOTE TO DEFEAT JOE BIDEN AND SAVE YOUR GREAT AMERICAN DREAM AND SAVE YOUR WONDERFUL AMERICAN FREEDOM. BIDEN IS A GRIMY, SLEAZY, AND CORRUPT CAREER POLITICIAN. WE FOUND THAT OUT. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN IT FOR A LONG TIME. WHO HAS DONE NOTHING BUT BETRAY YOU. ALL HE HAS DONE IS SELL OUT TO LOBBYISTS, SELL OUT TO LOBBYISTS, SELLOUT TO CHINA , CHINA OWNS HIM. SELL OUT TO BIG PHARMA, AND SELLOUT TO FOREIGN COMPANIES. HE WILL LICK YOU IN THE EYE AND TURN RIGHT AROUND , LOOK YOU IN THE EYE AND TURN AROUND AND STAB YOU. THE ONLY THING HE CARES ABOUT IS POLITICAL POWER AND HE WILL USE THAT POWER TO HURT YOU AND ENRICH HIS CRONIES AND FRIENDS. AND MOST OF ALL TO ENRICH HIS FAMILY. IT VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN IS ABOUT TO PUT FAR LEFT RADICALS LIKE KEITH ELLISON AND E LINE OMAR , ILHAN OMAR AND AOC PLUS THREE. BETO O'ROURKE WANTS TO TAKE YOUR GUNS ARRAY , GUNS AWAY. THEN THEY WANT TO PACK THE COURTS. WANT TO PACK THOSE COURTS. THE SUPREME COURT. I WANT TO PUT RADICAL JUSTICES WHO WILL CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS, TERMINATE YOUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY , ERASE ALL OF YOUR BORDERS, AND STIFLE LIFE. IF YOU WANT STRONG BORDERS, STRONG FAMILIES, SAFE COMMUNITIES, AND A THRIVING ECONOMY, THEN I AM ASKING YOU TO GO OUT ON NOVEMBER 3 AND VOTE FOR YOUR ALL-TIME FAVORITE PRESIDENT. ONE OF , THANK YOU. ONE OF THE MOST CRUCIAL ISSUES FOR MINNESOTA AND THE SELECTION IS THE SUBJECT OF REFUGEES. THIS IS A VITAL MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY I ISSUED A DIRECTIVE SUSPENDING THE ENTRY OF REFUGEES FROM FOUR NATIONS COMPROMISED BY TERRORISM. TERRORISM LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE, INCLUDING FROM SYRIA, SOMALIA, AND YEMEN. WE ARE KEEPING RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. I SPOKE TO PRESIDENT , I SPOKE TO PRESIDENT MACRON OF FRANCE YESTERDAY AND PUT OUT MY WARMEST SYMPATHY FOR WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH OVER THE LAST FOUR DAYS WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS, THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW HAVE SEEN. BIDEN HAS PLEDGED A STAGGERING 700% INCREASE IN REFUGEES FROM THE MOST DANGEROUS AND VIOLENT TERRORIST HOTSPOTS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. HE IS ALSO ABOUT TO TERMINATE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY TRAVEL BANS, CHECK FONT VERY HARD TO GET, WHICH I ONE , WON IN THE SUPREME COURT. HE SAID BRING THEM IN. BIDEN'S DEADLY MIGRATION POLICIES WILL OVERWHELM IN SODA AND OVERWHELM TAXPAYERS AND OPEN THE FLOODGATES TO TERRORISTS, JIHADISTS, AND VIOLENT EXTREMISTS. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION THE SAFETY OF OUR FAMILIES WILL ALWAYS COME FIRST. AMERICA FIRST. OUR FAMILIES FIRST. WITH YOUR SUPPORT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING BACK YOUR JOBS, YOUR TAXES, REGULATIONS, SUPPORT OUR GREAT POLICE, SUPPORT OUR MILITARY, DEFEND OUR BORDERS, PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT , WHICH IS TOTALLY UNDER SIEGE, BUT DON'T WORRY, AS LONG AS I'M HERE NOTHING IS HAPPENING WITH IT. PROTECT RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND ENSURE MORE PRODUCTS ARE PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THE VERY WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL PHRASE 'MADE IN THE USA.' YESTERDAY IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT LAST QUARTER OUR ECONOMY GREW AT THE FASTEST RATE EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 33.1%. PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED. I WASN'T. THE BIGGEST INCREASE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, BY FAR. 1952, BUT IT WAS A RATE LESS THAN HALF. WE ARE CREATING AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE THE LIKES OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. WE ARE BUILDING THE BIGGEST, STRONGEST, AND MOST PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS HUMAN HISTORY. I AM FIGHTING FOR HIGHER WAGES, MORE JOBS, MORE OPPORTUNITY, AND WE WILL KEEP IT RIGHT THERE AND WE WILL BRING IT RIGHT HERE TO THE USA, WHERE IT LONGS. , BELONGS. JOE BIDEN HAS NEVER SUCCEEDED BEFORE. BARACK OBAMA SAID, IF YOU WANT TO SEE THINGS SCREWED UP, JUST ASK JOE BIDEN TO DO IT. JOE BIDEN WILL SHIP YOUR FACTORIES TO CHINA, IMPOSE A $4 TRILLION TAX HIKE, ELIMINATE PRIVATE HEALTH CARE, ABOLISH THE ENTIRE OIL INDUSTRY AND FRACKING, AND SEND YOUR STATE INTO A CRIPPLING DEPRESSION. BIDEN'S ANTI-ENERGY ANTI-WORKER POLICIES WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE FOR LATINO AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN WORKERS ALL ACROSS OUR LAND. BIDEN WILL ALSO CONTINUE HIS 47 YEARS OF CRUELLY BETRAYING AFRICAN-AMERICANS. HE CALLED THEM SUPERPREDATORS IN 1994, RIPPED APART THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND DID EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO WIPE OUT THE BLACK MIDDLE CLASS. AND THEY UNDERSTAND IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY. I THINK YOU WILL PROBABLY SEE THAT AT THE PHOTO BOOTH THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE HAS DONE BETTER THAN ANYBODY. SUPERPREDATORS, HE SAID NOW BIDEN WANTS TO WIPE OUT THE ENTIRE INS, HISPANIC AMERICANS, AND ALL-AMERICANS. HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE IS DOING. HE WANTS TO GIVE YOU THE LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, BY FAR. BIDEN'S PLAN TO DELAY THE VACCINE, POSTPONE THERAPIES, CRASH THE ECONOMY, AND SHUT DOWN OUR ENTIRE COMPANY. HUNTER BIDEN'S LOCKDOWN, COUNTLESS AMERICANS WILL DIE FROM SUICIDE, DRUG OVERDOSES, AND DEFERRED MEDICAL CARE AT A LEVEL LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THERE WILL BE NO SCHOOL, NO GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS, NO THANKSGIVINGS, NO CHRISTMAS, NO FOURTH OF JULY, EASTER, NO NOTHING. THERE WILL BE NO FUTURE FOR AMERICA'S YOUTH. WE WILL DELIVER A SAFE VACCINE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND JUST A MATTER OF WEEKS. IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE VERY, VERY SPECIAL. WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN ON THE PANDEMIC, WITH A WILL , WITH OR WITHOUT VACCINE. WE HAVE THE VACCINE, EVEN WITHOUT IT, WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN. SENIORS WILL BE FIRST TO GET IT AND WHAT , AND IT WILL BE AVAILABLE FREE. IT WAS THE FAULT OF CHINA, WHO SHOULD HAVE KEPT IT THEN THEIR LIMITS. OUR VACCINE WILL ERADICATE THE VIRUS AND THE PANDEMIC. IT WILL AND. , IT WILL END. NORMAL LIFE, RECORD-SETTING EVERYTHING AND A NORMAL LIFE. NEXT YEAR WILL BE THE GREATEST ECONOMIC YEAR IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. HE WILL WIPE OUT THE CHINA PLAGUE ONCE AND FOR ALL. WE ARE JOINED TODAY BY CONGRESSMAN JIM HAGEDORN AND CONGRESSMAN TOM AMBER. THANK YOU, FILLERS , FELLOWS. AND CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE , SOMEBODY THAT IS REALLY OUTSTANDING, I THINK YOU TWO AGREE? MICHELLE FISCHBACH. GREAT JOB. I SAW YOU IN THE DEBATE, HE DID A FANTASTIC JOB , YOU DID A FANTASTIC JOB. THANK YOU, PAUL. STATE REPRESENTATIVE KURT DOUBT, THANK YOU. I LIKE YOUR HAT. AND GOP CHAIR JENNIFER CARNAHAN. DOING WELL? I THINK WE ARE GOING TO WIN. 1972. AND YOU HAVE BEEN TREATED VERY, VERY BADLY. IN ADDITION, MIKE LINDELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT JOB, GREAT JOB. PERFORMANCE , THIS IS A BIG 1 , MATT PURK, MINNESOTA VIKINGS SUPERSTAR, REALLY? LOOK AT HIM. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD PLAY TOMORROW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MATT. ANOTHER VITAL ISSUE IS THE MINNESOTA IRON RANGE. I BROUGHT IT BACK TO LIFE. IT WAS DEAD, IT WAS CLOSED, AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO USE IT. AS VICE PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN TRIED TO OBLITERATE THE IRONY RANGE. , IRON RANGE. THERE WAS BARELY A WHIMPER. I BROUGHT THE IRON RANGE GOING BACK TO LIFE. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO LIVE IN MINNESOTA. THEY SAID IT WAS SO UNFAIR. WHEN IT WAS CLOSED, AND MAY COME UP TO ME , I DON'T KNOW WHO HE WAS , HE WAS A STRONG, POWERFUL MAN AND HE WAS CRYING AND HE SAID, THEY HAVE TAKEN MY LIFE AWAY FROM ME. THAT WAS THE MOST CONVINCING OF ALL. WHEN I SAW HIM I SAID, THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. IT IS FULLY OPENED AND DOING PHENOMENALLY. IT HAS THE BEST IRON, THEY SAY, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. CONGRATULATIONS. CONGRATULATIONS. IT WAS MY HONOR. THAT AREA IS NOW THRIVING. IT WAS DESOLATE. NINE DEMOCRAT MAYORS HAVE ENDORSED ME, BECAUSE THEY KNOW BIDEN WILL SHUT DOWN THE IRON RANGE FOREVER. BY THE WAY, THEY WILL SHUT IT DOWN AS FAST AS I OPENED IT UP AND THEY WILL SHUT DOWN PERMANENTLY NEXT TIME. HE SAID WE MADE A MISTAKE, WE DIDN'T DO IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. THEY WILL SHUT IT DOWN PERMANENTLY. I HOPE YOU REMEMBER THAT. ESPECIALLY ON NOVEMBER 3. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP WE ACHIEVE THE MOST SECURE BORDER IN AMERICAN HISTORY. BIDEN'S PLAN TO ADMIT FOREIGN WORKERS WILL/INCOMES, SURGE UNEMPLOYMENT, AND DEVASTATE YOU MIDDLE-CLASS. ALL TO ENRICH HIS GLOBALIST DONORS. HE RAISES MONEY LIKE CRAZY BECAUSE HE IS MAKING DEALS. I COULD RAISE MUCH MORE THAN HIM, THAT I WILL NOT BE COMPROMISED. AND WE DON'T NEED THE MONEY. THAT'S HOW THEY RAISED ALL OF THAT MONEY, BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING DEALS WITH WALL STREET. AS PRESIDENT I WILL ONLY ADVANCE IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT PUT AMERICAN WORKERS AND FAMILIES FIRST. YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ARE MY ONLY SPECIAL INTEREST. THAT IS WHY I DID THIS. AND I HAD A VERY NICE LIFE BEFORE DOING THIS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU. I WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING FOR YOU HARDER THAN ANYONE HAS EVER DONE BEFORE. THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY WILL NEVER, EVER BE FORGOTTEN AGAIN. YOU KNOW THAT AND YOU SAW THAT. FOUR YEARS AGO WE HAD A VERY, VERY EXCITING TIME. THIS IS EVEN MORE EXCITING, AND FRANKLY THIS IS A MORE IMPORTANT ELECTION. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE SAYING THAT. A VOTE FOR ME AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS ABOUT FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM , IS A VOTE FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM. THAT IMPORTANT TIME HAS FINALLY ARRIVED. THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION. THIS IS A VERY BIG MOMENT FOR OUR COUNTRY. THIS TUESDAY OR SOONER, GET OUT AND VOTE. EVERYONE OF YOU. REMEMBER WHAT YOUR GOVERNOR DID THIS EVENING. AND IT IS A SMALL THING, BUT A HORRIBLE THING, TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE OUTSIDE THAT COULD BE HERE. WE COULD ALL BE TOGETHER. A HORRIBLE THING THEY DID. YOUR STATE AND COUNTRY DEPEND ON YOU. WE DEPEND ON YOUR BOAT. WE DEPEND ON YOUR LOYALTY, AND YOU HAVE MY LOYALTY , THAT YOU KNOW AND THAT YOU FOUND OUT. TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO MAKE HISTORY. ON NOVEMBER 3 WE ARE GOING TO MAKE HISTORY AND THIS WILL BE VERY SPECIAL FOR MINNESOTA. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR YEARS. EVEN WITH ME WE LOST BY HALF A POINT. ONE MORE STOP. I SHOULD HAVE COME ONE MORE TIME, JUST ONE MORE TIME. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NOT GOING TO MATTER BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN EVEN BIGGER VICTORY ON NOVEMBER 3. GOD BLESS YOU, GOD BLESS MINNESOTA, AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WE APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. NICE SEEING YOU, MATT. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.",

         "47",
         "Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation. The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people. Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first. There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country. This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission, and the power of American pride. In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade , the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you. In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution , and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness. Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades. In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom , a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs , something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started. Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history , 157 million. We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty , and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try. My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations. We have unleashed a revolution in American energy , the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before. On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone , almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States , and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way! We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate , some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country. Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans. And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population , and far beyond. Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing , and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life. In June, I commuted Alice's sentence , and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. When I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing. Inspired by stories like Alice's, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption. We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home. As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis. The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border. Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business. As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught. This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well-being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration , reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate , it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery. Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities , including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families , no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured. Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter, Madison. To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border. In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings. We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: 'If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job.' Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year. Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement , and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE. My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall , but the proper wall never got built. I'll get it built. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier , not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime , one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe. As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before , and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before. As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount , reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods , and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us , I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs. Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried , until now. Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement , or USMCA , will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA. Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us. Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure. I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill , and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity. The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs , and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Already, as a result of my Administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years. But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it. I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down. No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America. Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer. Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: 'Last Day of Chemo.' Grace , you are an inspiration to us all. Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research. To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave , so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children , born and unborn , are made in the holy image of God. The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security. Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military , with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO , but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies. As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System. Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests. For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't , in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far. As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam. Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido. We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom , and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair. Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence , not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled realism , not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel , and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East. As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home. I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor , and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement , but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole , and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack. We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country. We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery , but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil. Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall , more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: 'It's the Americans.' A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. 'To me,' Joshua recalls, 'the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.' I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight , seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation. When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America , they did it for us. Everything that has come since , our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice , all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before. Think of this Capitol , think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire. Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences , or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance , or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown. This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future , our fate , and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's destiny , that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world! Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!",

         "48",
         "Well, good morning. And thank you all for being here. I want to thank my wonderful wife, our Second Lady Karen Pence; the Surgeon General; Dr. Tony Fauci; and members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force who are joining us here today. I especially want to thank the fine medical team at Walter Reed Hospital that administered our vaccine today. I didn't feel a thing. Well done. And we appreciate your service to the country. You know, as the Christmas holiday approaches, this is always a season of hope. We gather here today, at the end of a historic week, to affirm to the American people that hope is on the way. And Karen and I were more than happy to step forward before this week was out to take the safe and effective coronavirus vaccine that we have secured and produced for the American people. It's a truly inspiring day. As the people of this country witnessed this past week, under Operation Warp Speed, the first coronavirus vaccine is literally being administered in states across the country to millions of Americans. And make no mistake about it: It's a medical miracle. The average vaccine, I'm told by our experts, usually takes between 8 and 12 years to develop and then manufacture and distribute. But we're on track, here in the United States, to administer millions of doses to the American people in less than one year. It is a miracle indeed. And I also believe that history will record that this week was the beginning of the end of the coronavirus pandemic. But with cases rising across the country, with hospitalizations rising across the country, we have a ways to go. And I want to assure the American people that we're going to continue to make sure that our healthcare providers have all the support and resources they need to meet this moment. But vigilance and the vaccine is our way through. And building confidence in the vaccine is what brings us here this morning. Ever since I was asked by President Trump to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, I have been inspired by the diligence and energy of our researchers in this country. Early on, the President brought some of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world together in the Cabinet Room and said that we needed medicines, we needed therapeutics, and we needed vaccines, and we needed them in record time. I watched the historic pace with which the dedicated men and women at the FDA worked. But, today, Karen and I wanted to step forward and take this vaccine to assure the American people that while we cut red tape, we cut no corners. And thanks to Operation Warp Speed, thanks to incredible research companies, thanks to the great work at the National Institute of Health, and the great and careful work of the FDA, and the leadership of our President in Operation Warp Speed, the American people can be confident we have one and perhaps, within hours, two safe and effective coronavirus vaccines for you and for your family. And now we're in the process of distributing millions of doses of a safe and effective vaccine all across the country. Working closely with our nation's governors, we've already seen the vaccine delivered to healthcare workers and seniors across the nation. This week, 2.9 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been allocated. And next week, 2 million more doses will be distributed across America. And as you all know, yesterday, the FDA advisory panel recommended approval of the Moderna vaccine. And when it is approved, we expect later today, we'll be in a position to ship 5.9 million doses of vaccines all across the country next week. In fact, under Operation Warp Speed, we are poised to have vaccine for 20 million Americans before the end of December. It is truly a medical miracle and an inspiration to people across this country. It is a , it's a tribute as well to the dedication of all of those working at the federal level and the state level who have implemented this project. From early on, President Trump gave the White House Coronavirus Task Force one mission, and that was to save lives. And in the midst of one of the most challenging years in the life of this nation, I truly do believe that, despite the heartbreak and hardship that we have endured as a nation, that we've done just that. Working with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force these last 10 months, we scaled testing. Now we're doing nearly 2 million tests a day and have performed more than 200 million coronavirus tests across America. And the FDA just approved the first over-the-counter coronavirus test for at-home testing for the American people. Working with the great team at FEMA and with the Department of Defense, we identified and distributed literally billions of medical supplies to our doctors and nurses and hospitals, and we'll continue to ensure that all of our caregivers in this country have the resources and the support they need to continue to meet this moment. We saw to the development of therapeutics, remdesivir, monoclonal antibodies, the good use of steroids, and other methods that have literally saved lives across the country. And as we gather here today, and as we celebrate this week, we secured a safe and effective vaccine that's being distributed all across America. I would be remiss if I didn't take this moment, at the end of this challenging year, simply to say thanks to the men and women who served on the White House Coronavirus Task Force. You will hear from several of them in just a few moments. But let me give credit where credit is due. I want to thank Dr. Tony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx. I want to thank Dr. Robert Redfield and all the great men and women at the CDC. I want to thank Secretary Alex Azar of HHS and Seema Verma at the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. And I also want to thank the great team at FEMA that has stood up the greatest national mobilization since World War Two, and Pete Gaynor, and General Sanford, and all of those that have worked to make sure that the American people and our healthcare workers have the supplies they need has made an extraordinary difference in the life of the nation. I'm also grateful for the steady hand and leadership of Dr. Ben Carson, who has been with us every step of the way. I know I speak for every American when I say , and I speak for our President when I say: Thank you for your service in this year and in the days to come. The truth is, the American people deserve to know that we've never been more prepared to combat the coronavirus than we are today. And even while we see cases rising and hospitalizations rising and heartbreaking losses, we'll continue to marshal the resources that we have secured as a nation, including a safe and effective vaccine to meet this moment. But that being said, it's important that every American remember that all of us have a role to play. The way through this challenging time is vigilance and a vaccine. The day will come when we put the coronavirus in the past, but it will be a combination of all the efforts that I just described: a vaccine that is safe and effective for the American people but also the ongoing vigilance of every American. So as we , as we reach this extraordinary and historic moment in the life of our nation, let me urge every American to continue to do your part: Put the health of your family, your neighbors, and your community first; practice good hygiene; wash your hands; practice social distancing, or wear a mask whenever it's indicated, or whenever you're unable to practice distance; and listen to your local authorities. As President Trump often says, we are rounding the corner. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel. It is the light of American innovation and creativity. It is the light of lifesaving medicines and a safe and effective vaccine. After a year of heartbreak and hardship, the American people can be encouraged. And Karen and I hope this step today will be a source of confidence and of comfort to the American people that thanks to all the men and women who have operated under Operation Warp Speed, that we have a safe and effective vaccine and that these days of hardship and heartbreak will, in a day not too far in the distance, will be put in the past. So with gratitude for the American ingenuity of our research companies, with gratitude for the incredible healthcare workers who have met this moment and continue to meet this moment in the life of the nation, with gratitude for all the officials at the federal and state level, and gratitude to our President for his vision with Operation Warp Speed, I'm confident that we will get through this, we will get through this together, and we will heal our land. So thank you all very much. (Applause.)",

         "I WISH WE COULD BE TOGETHER IN PERSON, BUT I'M GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH YOU VIRTUALLY. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK , PROBABLY THE MUTE BUTTON IS NOT WORKING AT HIS INTRODUCTION. THE INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP OF YOU AND YOUR FELLOWW BOARD MEMBERS FOR CREATING AND BUILDING THIS VITAL ORGANIZATION. THANKS AS WELL TO THE EXTRAORDINARY LEADERS, SENATOR HARRIS, DUCKWORTH, REPRESENTATIVE TO, ALL FOR BEING HERE. WE GOT A CHANCE TO TALK EARLIER. FOR ALL THE WORK YOU ARE DOING TO HELP FOLKS WHO NEED IT, IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU AND IT IS A SPECIAL HONOR TO BE CONDUCT , TO BE TOGETHER DURING AA PI. I AM ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE VICTORY FUND IT I WAS HONORED TO RECEIVE YOUR ENDORSEMENT IN JANUARY. THIS MADE A DIFFERENCE, WHICH NOW FEELS LIKE A LIFETIME AGO. THAT ABOUT OF COMPETENCE MEANT THE WORLD TO ME IN A CRITICAL MOMENT AND STILL DOES. AS I TOLD NUMBERS OF CONGRESS AN HOUR AGO, I WAS POLITICALLY RAISED IN THIS ARENA BY DANIEL INOUYE. HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON WHO ENCOURAGED ME TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I LEARNED AN AWFUL LOT FROM HIM. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR STANDING WITH ME LIKE DANNY DID. I HOPE YOUR FAMILIES ARE STAYING SAFE AND HEALTHY. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE ANXIOUS MOMENT FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES, OUR NATION AND THE WORLD. MY PRAYERS ARE WITH ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE SCARED, WHO ARE SICK, WHO O ARE GRIEVING AND JUST STRUGGLING TO GET BY. AS WE SPEAK TODAY, MORE THAN 90,000 AMERICANS HAVE NOW LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS PANDEMIC. SKILL , I DO NOT KNOW WHO'S PHONE THAT IS. THE SCALE OF THE LOSS IS STAGGERING. MORE THAN THAT, IT IS HEARTBREAKING SH. HOW MUCH FEAR, LOSS AND AGONY COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE PRESIDENT HAD NOT WASTED SO MUCH TIME IN TAKING RESPONSIBILITY. WE COULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING TEST. WE COULD HAVE MARSHALED SUPPLIES IN THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT, WHICH I CALLED FOR A LONG TIME AGO TO ENSURE EVERYONE COMMUNITY WAS READY. WE COULD HAVE BEEN EMBRACING THE PUBLIC TO ACT QUICKLY TO SLOW THE SPREAD. INSTEAD, WE GOT DENIAL, DELAYS, DISTRACTION. MANY OF WHICH WERE XENOPHOBIC. WE GOT PULLED FACED LIES ABOUT TESTING CAPACITY. THAT QUOTE, ANYBODY WHO A TEST CAN GET IT. IT WAS NOT REMOTELY TRUE TWO MONTHS AGO AND IS STILL NOT. WE GOT PROMISES. ONE DAY, , GOD ALMIGHTY. HE HAD MONTHS AND MONTHS TO TAKE ACTION. TO LEAD TO HE DID NOTHING BUT MAKE FALSE PROMISES AND DISMISS THE EXPERTS. NOW, 90,000 AMERICANS ARE GONE. LEAVING THE HIND , LEAVING BEHIND PROBABLY OVER 200,000, 300,000, 40,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST PART OF THEIR SOUL. MORE THAN 36 MILLION HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. MILLIONS MORE ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR BILLS. THIS PRESIDENT CANNOT SUMMON BARELY A WORD OF EMPATHY, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, EXPRESS REGRET. THERE IS NO INDICATION HE UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF THE PAIN AND THE LOSS THIS CRISIS HAS BROUGHT. IT IS NOT JUST LACK OF WORDS. IT IS LACK OF ACTION. CONGRESS GAVE THE ADMINISTRATION INTENSIFIED HIS OF DOLLARS FOR HELPING MAIN STREET IT WAS CALLED THE MAIN STREET LETTING PROGRAM TO HELP SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE NGRESS GAVE THAT MONEY CAN , THAT MONEY. THEY HAVE NOT LET A SINGLE DOLLAR YET. WHY DID THEY FAIL TO GET THIS MONEY OUT TO THE FOLKS WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT TO STAY AFLOAT? IS IT INCOMPETENCE? TRUMP IS TWEETING AGAIN THIS MORNING. REOPEN THE COUNTRY, END OF QUOTE. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT IF YOU ARE SITTING ON THE MONEY SMALL BUSINESSES NEED IN ORDER TO STAY ALIVE? STOP TWEETING ABOUT IT GET THE MONEY OUT TO MAIN STREET NOW. IT HAS BEEN PASSED. THIS PANDEMIC IS HITTING EVERYONE HARD. WE NEED SERIOUS COMPETENT LEADERSHIP NOW MORE THAN EVER. FRANKLY, WE NEED MORAL LEADERSHIP AS WELL. EVEN THOUGH THIS PANDEMIC HAS TOUCHED EVERY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD, AAPI COMMUNITY HAS HAD TO FIGHT ON AN ADDITIONAL FRONT. THE PANDEMIC HAS THE LEAST FAMILIAR FORCES OF HATE, FEAR AND XENOPHOBIA. WITH THIS PRESIDENT, IT BROUGHT , IT HAD BROUGHT WITH IT A NEW RASH OF RACIST MESSAGES, VERBAL, PHYSICAL ATTACKS AND OTHER ACTS OF HATE. SOME SUBTLE, SOME OVER, DIRECTLY AGAINST THE ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS SHOULD IT IS ONE OF , PACIFIC ISLANDERS. WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOLE OF THIS NATION. THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE WHAT HE IS DOING. IT STRIKES AT THE HEART OF OUR COUNTRY. WHO WE ARE, WHO WE WANT TO BE. THAT HATE IS ESPECIALLY DESPICABLE AT A TIME WHEN SO MANY ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE LEADING ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS FIGHT. LOOK AT THE THOUSANDS OF ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER NURSES, DOCTORS, RESEARCHERS, SCIENTISTS. DELIVERY DRIVERS, RETAIL WORKERS , RUNNING CRITICAL BUSINESSES, KEEPING US FED. THAT SERVICE IS NOT JUST ESSENTIAL. IT IS THE BEST OF AMERICA. IT IS THE BEST OF OUR STRENGTH, OUR COMPASSION, OUR SPIRIT. IT IS ALL BORN OF OUR UNIQUE DIVERSITIES AND PEOPLE. THE COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS. THE AAPI DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO NEVER MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO FAN THE FLAMES OF HATETE. YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO ATTACKS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE FOR VISITING A LOCAL CHINATOWN BUSINESS IN SAN FRANCISCO. YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO AGGRESSIVELY AND CHILDISHLY INSULTS ASIAN AMERICAN REPORTERS. THINK OF THAT. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE. INSULTS AND ASIAN AMERICAN REPORTER FOR DOING HER JOB AND ASKING A DIRECT QUESTION. YOU DESERVE A PARTNER AND A FRIEND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU DESERVE A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE HALLS. I WAS PROUD TO SERVE THE ADMINISTRATION THAT ALWAYS STOOD WITH THE AAPI COMMUNITY. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND IPHONE HARD TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY , OBAMA AND I FOUGHT HARD TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY. SECURE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR 2 MILLION ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE PROTECTED THOUSANDS OF AAPI DREAMERS GOING UP IN AMERICA. THE VERY PEOPLE NOW WHO ARE SAVING US, DOING THE JOBS AND RISKING LIVES. WE PROVIDED COMPENSATION FOR LONG OVERDUE , LONG OVERDUE COMPENSATION TO FILIPINO VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II. WE APPOINTED MAURYORE AAPI JUDGES TO THE BENCH THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION COMBINENED. WE ARE GOING TO STOP PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS TRACKS. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE TOGETHER AND ENSURE OUR GOVERNMENT ONCE AGAIN REFLECTS THE FULL DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY AND OUR COUNTRY AS A WHOLE INCLUDING MY CABINET. WE ARE TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE MADE TO DELIVER FOR THIS COMMUNITY ON HEALTH CARE, ON CLIMATE, ON BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT LEAVES NO ONE BEHIND. NOW, WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A TRAGEDY ON SO MANY LEVELS. THE PAIN WE ALL KNOW FROM FAIRLY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS IS SO STARK. SO CONSUMING. IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE ANYTHING BEYOND THAT PAIN. WE ARE GOING TO EMERGE FROM THIS MOMENT. WHEN WE DO, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE OF THE MOST BREATHTAKING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION. TO TAKE THIS. WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE DOCTORS, NURSES AND EMTS PUTTING THE LIVES ON THE LINE FOR US AND NY LOSING THEIR LIVES. A PUBLIC TRANSIT WORKER, GROCERY STORE CLERK CARRYING THE NATION ON THEIR B BACKS. ORDINARY AMERICANS SAYING, NO TO HATE, NO TO FEAR AND NO TO APATHY. REACHING OUT TO STRANGERS, CHECKING IN ON A FRIEND. WE CAN TAKE THAT SPIRIT. THE SOUL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND REBUILD THE COUNTRY IN ITS IMAGE. THIS MOMENT CAN BE AND MUST BE A STIRRING REMINDER OF WHO WE ARE, OF WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS REALLY ABOUT. I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THE WORLD AND TO PROVE TO OURSELVES WHAT AMERICA IS CAPABLE OF AT OUR BEST. TO FINALLY INVEST IN WORKERS. TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND BASED ON RACE, RELIGION, COLOR, ETHNICITY, DISABILITY. WE KNOW JUST HOW ESSENTIAL THEY TRULY ARE. TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY WHERE EVERYONE HAS A MYOPIC , AN OPPORTUNITY. MAKE SURE EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY IS TREATED WITH DEITY AND RESPECT. MY DAD USED TO SAY, EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT. WHETHER THERE IS A GUY SHINING THE SHOES OR THE PRESIDENT OF THE HOTEL CHAIN. WE HAVE A STRONG AND RESILIENT SAFETY NET WE HAVE TO RECONSTRUCT TO KEEP US GOING WHEN HARD TIMES HIT. I REVIEW RIGHT NOW MAY BE LIMITED BY THE BACKYARD IN THE BASEMENT AND THE SCENES OF OUR DEVICES, THAT I HOPE YOU WILL SEE WHAT I SEE. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SEPARATED PHYSICALLY, AND ENDURING DIFFICULT TIMES, I GIVE MY WORD I SEE A NATION GETTING READY TO COME TOGETHER. THE AAPI COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE BROKEN. OUR COMMUNITY AS A COUNTRY, OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY, WHICH IS A COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE BROKEN. NOT BY THIS PANDEMIC, NOT BY ANYTHING. NOT AS LONG AS WE STAND UNITED. WE ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS. WE CAN COME OUT ON THE OTHERS MUCH STRONGER, MUCH KINDER, MUCH CLOSER. JUST MORE RESILIENT THAN WE HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE. MCGREW, , REMEMBER, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAS TO GREAT CRISES AND AT THE END COME OUOUT STRONGER. WE NEED TO REMEMBER WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH IF WE WORK TOGETHER. COME THIS NOVEMBER, WITH YOUR HELP IN THE HELP OF THE ENTIRE ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY, WE ARE GOING TO PROVE IT. WE ARE GOING TO BE TOGETHER. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER. WE ARE GOING TO REMEMBER ALL THOSE WHO CARRIED US ON OUR , ON THEIR BACK THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. ORDINARY PEOPLE GETTING A CHANGE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF THIS MOVEMENT. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.",

         "Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, this is a momentous day for America, for the United States Constitution, and for the fair and impartial rule of law. The Constitution is the ultimate defense of American liberty. The faithful application of the law is the cornerstone of our Republic. That is why, as President, I have no more solemn obligation and no greater honor than to appoint Supreme Court justices. On this October evening , and it is so beautiful , the First Lady and I welcome you to the White House to bear witness to history. In a few moments, we will proudly swear in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court: Justice Amy Coney Barrett. (Applause.) She is one of our nation's most brilliant legal scholars, and she will make an outstanding justice on the highest court in our land. Justice Barrett's oath will be administered by the Court's longest-serving member currently on the bench , a man whose allegiance to the law has earned him the respect and gratitude of all Americans: Justice Clarence Thomas. (Applause.) Our country owes a debt of thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. We appreciate it very much, Mitch. Thank you. (Applause.) And we are grateful as well to the Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham. Thank you, Lindsey. (Applause.) Also with us, Senators Marsha Blackburn, Mike Braun, Bill Cassidy, Kevin Cramer, Ted Cruz, Steve Daines, Ron Johnson, James Lankford, Mike Lee, and Martha McSally. And I hope I didn't leave anybody out. (Applause.) And a very special thanks to our great Vice President, Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike. (Applause.) Also, I want to thank White House Counsel Pat Cipollone. Thank you, Pat. (Applause.) And very importantly, I want to welcome Justice Barrett's husband, Jesse. Thank you, Jesse. Thank you. (Applause.) Let me also recognize your seven children , your great, beautiful children , who have become, really, just very, very popular in this nation. People have been watching them and loving them, and they're watching right now back home in Indiana. Thank you very much. (Applause.) And I speak to everyone when I say that the Barrett family has captured America's heart. It is highly fitting that Justice Barrett fills the seat of a true pioneer for women: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Tonight, Justice Barrett becomes not only the fifth woman to serve on our nation's highest court, but the very first mother of school-aged children to become a Supreme Court justice. Very important. (Applause.) Over the past few weeks, the entire world has seen Justice Barrett's deep knowledge, tremendous poise, and towering intellect. She answered questions for hours on end. Throughout her entire confirmation, her impeccable credentials were unquestioned, unchallenged, and obvious to all. Justice Barrett earned a full academic scholarship to Notre Dame Law School, graduated first in her class, and served as a clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia. She was a beloved professor at Notre Dame Law School for 15 years before I very proudly appointed her to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in 2017. The American people have been profoundly impressed to learn of her achievements, her compassion, her generosity, her faith, and her sterling character. Justice Barrett has made clear she will issue rulings based solely upon a faithful reading of the law and the Constitution as written, not legislate from the bench. The equal, impartial, and constitutional rule of law that we enjoy every day in America is one of the crowning achievements in the history of human civilization. It is the triumph of reason, experience, and the values which are eternal and everlasting. Our devotion to this inheritance is what has made America the most just, exceptional, and glorious nation ever to exist. I want every American child watching to understand that this is a very special and important ceremony. We are fulfilling the duty that passes to each new generation to sustain the national traditions and virtues that make possible everything we have achieved before that we will do tomorrow. Because of our Constitution and our culture of freedom, you live in a land where anything is possible and where any dream can come true. No matter who you are, no matter your background, in America, everyone is entitled to equal protection under our laws, and your sacred rights can never, ever be taken away. The march of liberty that began with the American Revolution continues onward this evening. Tonight at the White House, we carry forward the cause of freedom, equality, and justice for which so many generations of Americans have given so much. We honor the cause for which men died to win the Civil War, and for which they jumped out of airplanes and shed their blood on distant battlefields. We honor the immortal principles that inspired millions in the struggle for Civil Rights, and we take special pride in the nation that inspires billions of people all over the world. We must never take this radiant inheritance for granted. We must never lose confidence in our history, our heritage, or in our heroes. To reach for the stars, we must stand upon the strong and sturdy foundation built by those incredible Americans who came before. Justice Barrett, as you take your oath tonight, the legacy of our ancestors falls to you. The American people put their trust in you and their faith in you as you take up the task of defending our laws, our Constitution, and this country that we all love. We ask God to give you wisdom and courage. I know you will make us all very, very proud. As long as we are loyal to our founding and to our fellow citizens, America's future will be bright, America's destiny will be great, and America's people will forever and always be free. I now ask Justice Thomas to administer the Oath. Thank you very much. (The Judicial Oath is administered.) (Applause.) JUSTICE BARRETT: Thank you. Thank you so very much. Thank you all for being here tonight. And thank you, President Trump, for selecting me to serve as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. It's a privilege to be asked to serve my country in this office, and I stand here tonight truly honored and humbled. Thanks also to the Senate for giving its consent to my appointment. I am grateful for the confidence you have expressed in me, and I pledge to you and to the American people that I will discharge my duties to the very best of my ability. This was a rigorous confirmation process, and I thank all of you, especially Leader McConnell and Chairman Graham for helping me to navigate it. My heartfelt thanks go to the members of the White House staff and Department of Justice who worked tirelessly to support me through this process. Your stamina is remarkable, and I have been the beneficiary of it. Jesse and I are also so grateful to the many people have supported , who have supported our family over these last several weeks. Through ways both tangible and intangible, you have made this day possible. Jesse and I have been truly awestruck by your generosity. I have spent a good amount of time over the last month at the Senate, both in meetings with individual senators and in days of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The confirmation process has made ever clearer to me one of the fundamental differences between the federal judiciary and the United States Senate, and perhaps the most acute is the role of policy preferences. It is the job of a senator to pursue her policy preferences. In fact, it would be a dereliction of duty for her to put policy goals aside. By contrast, it is the job of a judge to resist her policy preferences. It would be a dereliction of duty for her to give in to them. Federal judges don't stand for election. Thus, they have no basis for claiming that their preferences reflect those of the people. This separation of duty from political preference is what makes the judiciary distinct among the three branches of government. A judge declares independence not only from Congress and the President, but also from the private beliefs that might otherwise move her. The Judicial Oath captures the essence of the judicial duty the rule of law must always control. My fellow Americans, even though we judges don't face elections, we still work for you. It is your Constitution that establishes the rule of law and the judicial independence that is so central to it. The oath that I have solemnly taken tonight means, at its core, that I will do my job without any fear or favor, and that I will do so independently of both the political branches and of my own preferences. I love the Constitution and the Democratic Republic that it establishes, and I will devote myself to preserving it. Thank you. (Applause.)",

         "I LOVE GEORGIA. I LOVE BEING WITH YOU. THIS IS GEORGIA. THANK, GEORGIA. WE WON GEORGIA. WE ARE GOING TO WIN IT AGAIN. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK ON THIS INCREDIBLE STAGE WITH THE THOUSANDS OF LOYAL, HARD-WORKING, UNBELIEVABLE AMERICAN PATRIOTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 18 DAYS FROM NOW, WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOUR MORE YEARS. AND THAT BEAUTIFUL AND INCREDIBLE IN SO MANY WAYS, THAT BEAUTIFUL WHITE HOUSE, RIGHT? JUST REMEMBER THAT EARLY VOTING IS UNDERWAY. GET OUT AND VOTE. GO OUT AND VOTE. SO, WE ARE RUNNING AGAINST PERHAPS THE WORST CANDIDATE IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS. IF YOU WATCHED LAST NIGHT, I MEAN, GIVE ME A BREAK. I WISH HE WAS A GOOD CANDIDATE BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY PUTS MORE PRESSURE ON YOU RUNNING AGAINST A GUY LIKE THIS. SLEEPY JOE BIDEN IS THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE CORRUPT POLITICAL CLASS THAT ENRICHED ITSELF WHILE DRAINING THE ECONOMIC LIFE AND SOUL FROM OUR COUNTRY. YOU KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED. YOU KNOW VERY WELL IN GEORGIA WHAT HAPPENED. FOR THE LAST 47 YEARS, JOE BIDEN SHIPPED AWAY YOUR JOBS, SHUTDOWN YOUR FACTORIES, THROUGH OPEN YOUR BORDERS, AND RAVAGED OURS CITIES WHILE SACRIFICING AMERICAN BLOOD AND TREASURE IN AND LISTEN RIDICULOUS FOREIGN WARS. IN PLACES YOU HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF BEFORE. HOW RIDICULOUS. HE IS A SERVANT OF THE WEALTHY DONORS, GLOBALISTS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS, WHO GOT RICH LEADING AMERICA DRIVE. BY THE WAY, I CALL HEADS OF WALL STREET FIRMS. I SAY DO ME A FAVOR, COULD YOU GIVE ME 5 MILLION DOLLARS. EVERY SINGLE I CAN'T DO THAT THOUGH, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY? IF I DO THAT, I'VE GOT TO DO THINGS FOR THEM, AND I WANT TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. I CAN RAISE MORE MONEY I HAVE BEEN THE WORLD'S GREATEST FUNDRAISER, BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE THEN THEY CALL YOU AND SAY HEY, YOU KNOW, THEY TREATED ME GOOD, I'VE GOT TO TREAT THEM GOOD. I KNOW YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS, BUT THAT'S THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS, I GUESS, UNFORTUNATELY. IN 2016, YOU VOTED TO FIRE THE CREPE IT THE CORRUPT AND DECREPIT POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND DECIDED TO FINALLY PUT AMERICA FIRST. AND WE HAVE LEARNED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, JOE BIDEN IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN. HE IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN. AND THE BIDEN FAMILY IS A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. FRANKLY, IT MAKES CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON LOOK LIKE AN AMATEUR. WHOEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE THIS. HE GOES TO CHINA, THEY FOLLOW HIM LIKE A VACUUM CLEANER. AND UNFORTUNATELY, IT SOUNDS LIKE HE LEFT HIS LAPTOP BEHIND. THEY TAKEN MILLIONS AND PLENTY OF IT GOES TO JOE BIDEN, DON'T KID YOURSELF. DID YOU SEE THE ONE TODAY? THE GUY GETS 10%. I WONDER WHO THE GUY IS? BETWEEN ANTHONY WEINER'S LAPTOP AND THIS LAPTOP, THESE ARE TWO BEAUTIES. THIS MASSIVE SCANDAL IS BEING COVERED UP BY THE MEDIA AND BIG TECH, RIGHT, ALL THOSE PEOPLE. HERE WE HAVE, THINK OF IT, THE BIGGEST SCANDAL GOING ON ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, THE CORRUPTION OF JOE BIDEN AND THE BIDEN FAMILY, AND HE IS INTERVIEWED LAST NIGHT BY STEPHANOPOULOS ON ABC, AND THEY DON'T EVEN ASK HIM A QUESTION ABOUT IT. THINK OF IT. THEY DON'T EVEN ASK HIM A QUESTION LIKE HOW COME YOUR SON GOT $3.5 MILLION FROM MOSCOW RUSSIA. BECAUSE THEY WERE THE ONES INVOLVED WITH RUSSIA, IT TURNS OUT, NOT ME, IT WAS THE OPPOSITE. WHY DID YOUR SON GET $3.5 MILLION FROM THE WIFE OF THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW? THINK OF IT. REMEMBER CHRIS WALLACE SAID YOU SHOULDN'T ASK HIM THAT QUESTION. HE IS NO MIKE. CHRIS IS NO MIKE. HOW ABOUT THE OTHER ONE? A BILLION DOLLARS, GET RID OF THE PROSECUTOR, OTHERWISE YOU DON'T GET A BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE UNITED STATES. BUT THAT'S TURNING OUT TO BE PEANUTS COMPARED TO WHAT WE ARE FINDING NOW. NOW WE ARE FINDING OUT HE WANTS $10 MILLION FROM CHINA TO MAKE AN INTRODUCTION. WOULD ANYONE HERE TAKE $10 MILLION TO INTRODUCE SOMEONE TO YOUR FATHER? I WOULD DO IT. DAD, I WOULD LOVE TO DO IT. $10 MILLION, PLEASE. I HAD A GREAT FATHER. I AM NOT JUST RUNNING AGAINST BIDEN AND THEIR CORRUPT FAMILY, I AM RUNNING AGAINST THE LEFT-WING CORRUPT MEDIA, AND WE ARE RUNNING AGAINST BIG TECH. THIS IS A HELL OF A BIG CROWD. LOOK AT THAT. IT GOES ALL THE WAY AROUND. THE MEDIA, THEY NEVER SHOW IT. YOU EVER NOTICE? THEY SHOW ME IN THREE PEOPLE BEHIND ME. AND ABOUT THREE PEOPLE BEHIND ME. YOU KNOW I LOVE THAT. NO POLITICIAN, I BELIEVE, HAS EVER HEARD THAT CHANT. REALLY. WE LOVE SOMEONE. THINK OF IT. REAGAN, I LOVE DRAGON, HE WAS A WONDERFUL GUY, I LOVED REAGAN, HE WAS A WONDERFUL GUY, YOU NEVER HEARD THAT CHANT. WE LOVE REAGAN. I APPRECIATE IT. I LOVE THIS STATE. I LOVE GEORGIA. YOU HAD THE HURRICANE COME IN AND IT WIPED OUT A LOT OF YOUR AREA. DAVID PERDUE IS A FANTASTIC GUY WHO MAY BE HERE SOMEPLACE. HE CALLED ME AND SAID YOU HAVE TO DO ME A FAVOR. YOU HAVE TO HELP US WITH OUR FARMERS AND WE GAVE THEM A HELL OF A LOT OF MONEY. THEY GOT WIPED OUT BY A HURRICANE. YOU DON'T GET TOO MANY HURRICANES, BUT THIS WAS A MONSTER THAT HIT FLORIDA, ALABAMA. WE TOOK CARE OF ALABAMA. WE TOOK CARE OF GEORGIA. I WILL NEVER FORGET, I STOOD, I CAME HERE AND I STOOD, AND I WAS WITH 32 FARMERS, ALL OF THEM GOT HIT HARD. AND ONE OF THEM SAID I WAS SO WEAK AWAY FROM HAVING THE BEST CROP I HAVE EVER HAD I WAS A WEEK AWAY FROM HAVING THE BEST CROP I HAVE EVER HAD, AND IT GOT RIPPED APART. IT WASN'T HIS FAULT. WE TOOK CARE OF HIM. AND IT MADE ME FEEL GOOD. AND THEY NEVER ASK FOR ANYTHING. THEY JUST WANT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. 28 MILLION THANK YOU CHINA, BECAUSE THEY TARGETED OUR FARMERS. 12 BILLION AND THEN THE NEXT YEAR $16 BILLION. FRANKLY, YOU DID BETTER WITHOUT EVEN WORKING, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. CAME FROM CHINA AND WE DID A HELLUVA JOB AND THOSE FARMERS ARE ALL HAPPY TODAY. TALKING ABOUT CHINA, WE GOT $28 BILLION IN TARIFFS AND WE GAVE IT TO FARMERS, AND EVERYBODY IS DOING JUST FINE. BUT THE RADICAL LEFT IS DOING EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO PROTECT THEIR CHOSEN CANDIDATE WHO HAS NO CLUE WHERE HE IS. HE'S GONE. THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT DISDAIN FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR VALUES, AND FOR THE VALUES OF GEORGIA. I KNOW GEORGIA VERY WELL. THEY HAVE FLOODED YOUR COMMUNITIES WITH CRIMINAL ALIENS, WITH DRUGS, CRIME, WHILE LEAVING BEHIND AND YOU SEE WHAT THEY DO. THEY LIVE IN GATED COMMUNITIES. THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT GUNS AND THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT EVERYTHING, AND THEN THEY WANT TO END YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT THAT THEY WANT PROTECTION FOR THEMSELVES. THEY OPPOSE SCHOOL CHOICE WHILE SENDING THEIR FAMILIES TO THE BEST PRIVATE SCHOOLS. WE NEED SCHOOL CHOICE, BY THE WAY. THEY DEMONIZE HELLO. BEAUTIFUL. SO BEAUTIFUL. THEY DEMONIZE OUR GREAT POLICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WHILE HIRING PRIVATE SECURITY FOR THEMSELVES. THEY ATTACK THE SECOND AMENDMENT EVERY SINGLE DAY WHILE EMPLOYING ARMED GUARDS. AND LET ME TELL YOU, I AM THE ONLY THING STANDING IN THE WAY OF YOU AND YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. UNDERSTAND. IT'S A BIG DEAL. THEY SUPPORT CRIPPLING LOCK DOWNS THEIR JOBS REMAIN TOTALLY EXEMPT. IT'S TIME WE SEND A MESSAGE TO THESE WEALTHY LIBERAL HYPOCRITES . BY THE WAY, JUST LIKE I SAID BEFORE, I KNOW THESE GUYS, I COULD CALL THEM ALL. DO ME A FAVOR. IRVING, SEND ME $5 MILLION, OK, I WILL DO IT IF YOU WANT. DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE ONE WEEKEND JUST DO IT? I WILL SET THE ALL-TIME RECORD ON FUNDRAISING. MAN, WOULD I BE GOOD AT THAT. IT'S SO EASY. I WOULDN'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN A THING. BUT THEY COME FROM WASHINGTON, THEY COME FROM NEW YORK, THEY COME FROM SILICON VALLEY. BY THE WAY, THOSE SILICON VALLEY GUYS ARE SORT OF GETTING CAUGHT, AREN'T THEY? SECTION 230, I AM SURE MOST OF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, SECTION 230, THESE GUYS ARE GIVEN POWERS, THEY ARE GIVEN RIGHTS BY WASHINGTON, AND THEN THEY CLAIM FREE SPEECH. BUT THEY ARE GIVEN AN EXEMPTION. THEY HAVE A TOTAL EXEMPTION. AND THEY CANNOT ABUSE THAT POWER. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON RIGHT NOW, AND A LOT OF YOUR PEOPLE ARE LOOKING WE HAVE SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE HERE, YOUR GREAT CONGRESSMEN, SENATORS, WE WILL BE INTRODUCING THEM IN A SECOND, BUT THEY WILL BE LOOKING VERY HARD AT SECTION 230. ON ELECTION DAY, YOU CAN SEND MESSAGE THAT THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA LOOK AT THEM. THERE'S A LOT OF THEM. IT'S LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE. LOOK AT THOSE CAMERAS, THEY ARE ALL RUNNING WITH THOSE RED LIGHTS, BUT EVERY TIME I MENTION THEIR NAME, THOSE RED LIGHTS GO OFF. GET THE LIGHT OFF. TURN IT OFF! GO TO A BREAK! LET'S GO TO A BREAK RIGHT NOW. FAKE NEWS, CNN, THEY ARE SO FAKE. NBC DID YOU SEE THAT LAST NIGHT? THEY COULD HAVE THEY DID A GOOD JOB. I COULD'VE HAD SOMEBODY ELSE. THEY ARE ALL THE SAME. THEY ASK YOU A QUESTION AND YOU GIVE AN ANSWER. SHE HAS DISAPPEARED. EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS SO INAPPROPRIATE. THEY GIVE THIS GUY SOFTBALLS. DID YOU SEE, A WEEK AGO, LESTER HOLT, ANOTHER GENIUS, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR DINNER? AND THEN SAVANNAH, IT WAS LIKE HER FACE, THE ANGER, THE CRAZINESS. I MEAN THE CRAZINESS LAST NIGHT. AND I SAID GOODBYE, I SAID YOU DID WONDERFULLY, GOOD JOB. WE GOT VERY HIGH MARKS FOR THAT LAST NIGHT, AND SLEEPY JOE CANNOT ANSWER A QUESTION. CHRIS WALLACE WOULDN'T ASK ABOUT THE $3 MILLION. HE SAID THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE. WHY? I'M TELLING YOU, THE BIDEN FAMILY IS CORRUPT. THE CORRUPT FAMILY. AND WITH ME AND MY KIDS, LET ME TELL YOU, I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING LOCK THEM UP. YOU SHOULD LOCK THEM UP. LOCK UP THE BIDEN'S. LOCK THEM UP. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF MY KIDS DID WHAT HUNTER IS DOING? IVANKA. OH, MY BEAUTIFUL, SHE'S A GOOD KID. AND YOU KNOW, SHE IS MUCH SMARTER, MUCH SHARPER, SHE COULD. SHE WOULD DO WELL. DON, ERIC, TIFFANY, THEY ARE GOOD KIDS. WE WOULD MAKE A FORTUNE. JUST THINK OF IT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY GET AWAY WITH. BY THE WAY, BIDENS BROTHER I WON'T GO TOO DEEP IN THE FAMILY, I'M NOT LOOKING TO INSULT EVERYBODY, BUT IN MY OPINION, IT'S A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. IT'S LIKE A VACUUM CLEANER. THE FATHER GOES THROUGH WHEN THE SUN COMES THROUGH LIKE A VACUUM CLEANER, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TAKE A LOOK AT THE WAY THEY LIVE . 47 YEARS AS A POLITICIAN, HE HAS DONE VERY WELL. ALMOST AS WELL AS MAXINE WATERS. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HER HOUSE? WHAT A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE SHE LIVES IN. I WONDER HOW THAT HAPPENED. ON ELECTION DAY, YOU CAN SEND A MESSAGE THAT THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA CAN'T GET AWAY WITH IT ANY LONGER. WE CAN'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. AND THESE BIG TECH COMPANIES, YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE BIG TECH COMPANIES. I DIDN'T CARE TOO MUCH. I HEARD THE POWER WAS UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S LIKE 99% FOR THE OTHER SIDE. I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE POWER, THE POWER. IN ONE EAR COME OUT THE OTHER, BUT I KEPT HEARING IT, AND WE WON. I KEPT HEARING IT, BUT WE WON. IF THEY ARE SO POWERFUL, HOW COME WE WON? THEY WERE 100% AGAINST US. BUT IT'S GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE, AND NOW THEY HAVE GONE CRAZY. HOW ABOUT OUR MAGNIFICENT KAYLEE, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD IS, BUT THEY SUSPENDED HER ACCOUNT BECAUSE SHE POSTED AN ARTICLE FROM THE NEW YORK POST, THE ONE PAPER THAT REALLY HAS GUTS, THEY ARE PRINTING THIS STUFF, THEY HAVE GOT TO BE MAKING A FORTUNE, AS MUCH AS THEY CAN MAKE IN THAT INDUSTRY THESE DAYS, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES ON THE WASHINGTON POST, THEY DON'T WANT TO WRITE ABOUT IT. THIS IS THE BIGGEST THE SECOND-BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL. THE BIGGEST, WE CAUGHT THEM, WHEN THEY SPIED ON OUR CAMPAIGN AND TRIED TO TAKE DOWN YOUR PRESIDENT. THIS IS THE SECOND BUSINESS SECOND-BIGGEST SCANDAL. THESE ARE A BUNCH OF BAD PEOPLE, AND YOU THINK IT'S FUN DOING WHAT I DO. I HAD A GREAT LIFE. I WAS DOING WELL. I WAS HAVING A LOT OF FUN. BUT I WOULD NEVER GIVE UP WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED. THINK OF WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED. HONESTLY, THERE ARE A LOT OF SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE, A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL, A LOT OF THEM RIGHT HERE. BUT NOBODY IN THE FIRST THREE AND A HALF YEARS, NOBODY HAS ACHIEVED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED WITH OUR MILITARY, WITH OUR TAX CUTS, WITH OUR REGULATIONS, WITH ALL OF THE THINGS WE HAVE DONE, NOBODY HAS DONE AS MUCH AS WE HAVE DONE, THINGS LIKE RIGHT TO TRY, THINGS LIKE SPACE FORCE. YOU NOW, I ALWAYS GET THEM. I SAID TURNED THE CAMERAS, TURN THE CAMERAS. WE HAD A CROWD LIKE THIS IN FLORIDA. IT WAS MASSIVE. IT WENT ON FOREVER. I SAID TURNED THE CAMERAS, SHOW THE CROWD. THEY DON'T REALIZE IT'S GOOD FOR THEM. IT'S EXCITING. IT'S LIKE BEING OUT OF FLORIDA STATE OR OHIO STATE FOOTBALL GAME. WE HAVE TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE, YOU HAVE ALL THESE EMPTY SEATS. YOU WILL BE BACK VERY SOON. AND THEN OF COURSE, GEORGIA, NOT BAD, YOU ARE DOING OK. AND WHO IS THE GREATEST OF THEM ALL FROM GEORGIA? WHO IS THE GREATEST OF THEM ALL FROM GEORGIA? HERSCHEL. BY THE WAY, HOW GOOD WAS HERSCHEL WALKER, RIGHT? HE MADE A LOT OF QUARTERBACKS LOOK GOOD, SIX YARDS, NINE YARDS, 10 YARDS, A HUNDRED YARDS, AND HE IS ON OUR SIDE, AND HE DIDN'T INCREDIBLE JOB, A GOOD GUY. I REMEMBER THEY HAD THE BALLAD TO HERSCHEL WALKER, A LEGENDARY GUY. FROM THE TIME WE STARTED, SIX YARDS, 10 YARDS, EIGHT YARDS, AND THEN THE QUARTERBACK SAYS I THINK I WILL SIGN WITH THE NFL. BUT HERSCHEL HAS BEEN GREAT. HE LOVES THIS STATE. WHAT A GREAT FOOTBALL PLAYER HE WAS. WHAT A GREAT WINNER. WE WANT TO THANK HERSCHEL. ON NOVEMBER 3, SHOW THE PEOPLE, THE GREAT AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT WE ARE IN CHARGE, THAT WE ARE DELIVERING, SLEEPY JOE BIDEN AND THAT WHOLE GROUP OF RADICAL LEFT CRAZIES. BY THE WAY, HE IS NOT REALLY RADICAL LEFT, BUT HE HAS NO CHOICE. HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING GOING. THEY ARE RUNNING THE PARTY. HOW GOOD DID MIKE PENCE DO A WEEK AGO? THAT WAS EASY. THAT WAS EASY. MIKE IS GREAT. HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT IT'S UNFAIR. IT'S SO UNFAIR. YOU WATCH LAST NIGHT AND YOU SEE THE ANGER AND THE HATE. I'M SAYING LOOK, LET'S JUST DO THIS THING. TAKE IT EASY, RELAX. RELAX, TAKE IT NICE AND EASY, OK. SHE SAID BUT I TOLD YOU THIS. I SAID I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. WHY WOULD I BELIEVE YOU? DID YOU SEE THAT WHERE SHE IS SCREAMING? WHO CARES IF YOU TOLD ME? WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME? BUT WE GOT VERY HIGH MARKS, BUT COMPARE THAT COULD YOU IMAGINE IF JOE BIDEN WAS TREATED LIKE SAVANNAH GUTHRIE TREATED US NOT ME. IT'S US. COULD YOU IMAGINE? HE WOULD BE FREAKED OUT. HE WOULD PROBABLY BE UNDER THE TABLE. AND SHE IS EASY COMPARED TO PRESIDENT XI JINPING, PUTIN, KIM JONG-UN NONE PLENTY OF OTHERS. SHE'S EASY PICKINGS, KIM JONG-UN AND PLENTY OF OTHERS. SHE'S EASY PICKINGS. I WAS INTERVIEWED BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS. IT WAS TOUGH, BUT IT WAS FINE. I DON'T SAY GIVE ME THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS. DO YOU EVER SEE WHERE THEY ASK AND THEN HE STARTS READING THAT MEANS HE HAS THE ANSWERS. I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. HOW ABOUT, DID YOU SEE THAT A WEEK AGO I CAN'T READ THE DAM ANSWER. THIS IS THE FAKE NEWS. I'VE BEEN SAYING IT. I AM SO PROUD OF THE FACT THAT I HAVE EXPOSED THESE PEOPLE FOR WHAT THEY ARE. REALLY. LOOK AT ALL THAT EQUIPMENT, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF EQUIPMENT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IF THEY WERE TRUTHFUL, OUR COUNTRY WOULD COME TOGETHER SO FAST. THEY ARE A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM. I WAS SAYING TODAY, AND FLORIDA, I WAS TELLING THE STORY, WE ARE GOING TO BRING IT ALL TOGETHER. THEY SAID HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT? THROUGH SUCCESS. BECAUSE WE WERE READY. WE HAD THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ECONOMY WE HAVE EVER HAD. AFRICAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN AMERICAN, HISPANIC AMERICAN, WOMEN, PEOPLE WITH HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS, PEOPLE WITHOUT HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS, CHEMICAL ENGINEERS, EVERYBODY WAS DOING BETTER THAN THEY HAVE EVER DONE, AND THEN WE HAD THE PLAGUE SENT TO US BY CHINA. WE ARE NOT GOING TO FORGET THAT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO FORGET THAT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO FORGET IT AND THEY KNOW WE ARE NOT GOING TO FORGET IT. THEY KNOW DAM WELL WE ARE NOT GOING TO FORGET IT. WE CLOSED IT DOWN. WE SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES. OVER 200,000, THAT'S TERRIBLE, BUT COMPARED TO OTHER NATIONS, IT'S AMAZING WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO. BUT WE SAVED MILLIONS. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 2.2 MILLION LIVES. WE SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES, AND NOW WE ARE REBUILDING IT BACK, AND NOW OUR ECONOMY IS SETTING RECORDS. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS SETTING RECORDS. IF I DON'T SOUND LIKE A TYPICAL WASHINGTON POLITICIAN, IT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. AND IF I DON'T ALWAYS PLAY BY THE RULES OF THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT YOU KNOW, IT WOULD MAKE MY LIFE A LOT EASIER, TO BE HONEST. REMEMBER, I USED TO PLAY THE GAME ABOUT ACTING PRESIDENTIAL. SMART GUY, A LOT OF SMART PEOPLE HERE, I'M SMART. IT'S MUCH EASIER TO BE PRESIDENTIAL THAN TO DO WHAT I DO, REMEMBER? I SAID I AM MORE PRESIDENTIAL IF I WANT TO BE, BUT I HAVE TO GET THINGS DONE. I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME. SO MANY STUPID THINGS HAPPEN, BED DEALS, STUPID DEALS, BAD TRADE DEALS, BUT REMEMBER I USED TO GO ON HAVE FUN AND I WOULD SAY A PRESIDENT WHO IS PLAYING PRESIDENTIAL, THAT IS SO EASY COMPARED TO WHAT WE DO. I CAN BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN OUR HISTORY WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN WHEN HE WORE THE HAT. THAT WAS TOUGH TO DO. BUT DO YOU REMEMBER, I WOULD SAY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF GEORGIA, THIS IS YOUR PRESIDENT, AND IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO BE WITH YOU TONIGHT. THINGS ARE GOING VERY WELL WITH OUR COUNTRY. OUR MILITARY IS BUILDING. AND WITHIN ABOUT THREE MINUTES, EVERYONE WOULD PICK UP AND SAY LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. NO, WE ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. WE ARE RENEGOTIATING THESE HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS. WE ARE BRINGING PEOPLE BACK HOME. I WAS ELECTED TO FIGHT FOR YOU AND I FIGHT HARDER FOR YOU THAN ANY PRESIDENT HAS EVER FOUGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. BY THE WAY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE SPIRIT IN THIS COUNTRY IS UNBELIEVABLE. THE SPIRIT AT THESE RALLIES ARE UNBELIEVABLE. AND YOU KNOW, HEY, WE WERE IN MINNESOTA. WE ARE GOING TO WIN MINNESOTA. MINNESOTA HASN'T BEEN WON SINCE 1972. WE ARE GOING TO MIN WIN MINNESOTA. WE ARE GOING TO WIN MINNESOTA. WE OPENED UP AREAS OF MINNESOTA THAT THEY CLOSED. IN MAINE, OBAMA TOOK AWAY 5000 SQUARE MILES OF OCEAN, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? I GAVE IT BACK TO THE PEOPLE OF MAINE. WE ARE DOING THINGS NOBODY HAS EVER THOUGHT ABOUT DOING OR EVER DONE. WE WENT INTO YOU TAKE A LOOK AT TAKE A LOOK AT MINNEAPOLIS. THE PLACE WAS BURNING DOWN. THE NATIONAL GUARD GOES IN. 30 MINUTES, WOULD YOU SAY? REMEMBER, AFTER WATCHING THIS FOR A WEEK AND A HALF, AND WE WANT TO DO IT WITH PORTLAND. PORTLAND WOULD BE SO EASY. THEY HAVE WISE GUYS IN THERE. THEY HAVE THE ONE GUY WHO KILLED SOMEBODY ON THE STREET. IT TOOK THEM THREE DAYS TO ARREST. I SENT IN THE U.S. MARSHALS. 15 MINUTES LATER IT WAS OVER. I SAID WHY HASN'T THAT GUY BEEN THEY ALL DO IT. THEY WERE PUTTING HIS PICTURE UP. WHY HASN'T HE BEEN ARRESTED? REALLY? ANOTHER DAY, WE SENT IN THE U.S. MARSHALS. IN 15 MINUTES, WE HAD THE GREATEST LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. 15 MINUTES LATER, IT WAS ALL OVER FOR HIM. BUT THE FORCES OPPOSING ME IN WASHINGTON ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY DISASTROUS TRADE DEAL, FOREIGN POLICY BLUNDER, AND BORDER SECURITY BETRAYAL. LOOK AT OUR BORDER. OUR SON AND DAUGHTERS BY THE WAY, 400 MILES OF WALL. 10 MILES A WEEK. IT WILL BE FINISHED VERY SOON. IT HAS HAD AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT. WE GOT RID OF CATCH AND RELEASE, ALL THIS STUFF EVERYBODY SAID WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE. AND MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL. YOU DO KNOW THAT. MEXICO IS PAYING FOR. THEY KNOW THAT. BUT THEY DON'T LIKE TO SAY IT. WE ARE DOING SOME INCREDIBLE THINGS. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 2016 WAS IMPORTANT. THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT. SUCCESS WILL BRING US TOGETHER, AS I WAS SAYING, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE? A VICTORY. THEY ARE JUST GOING TO FINALLY SAY, LET'S JUST GIVE UP. THEY ARE GOING TO SAY THESE PEOPLE CANNOT BE BEATEN. THEY ARE GOING TO SAY THESE PEOPLE CANNOT BE BEATEN. AND MANY OF THEM WERE SO HAPPY TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN THEY HEARD TRUMP TESTED POSITIVE. THEY WERE SO HAPPY. AND THEN I GOT OUT LIKE RIGHT AWAY, HERE I'M, LIKE A LONG TIME. CAN YOU IMAGINE, HE WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD ANYMORE RALLIES? HE WILL BE RECOVERING OR WORSE. OR WORSE. HE WILL BE RECOVERING OR WORSE. THEN LIKE 12 MINUTES LATER, HERE WE ARE. DON'T FORGET, I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. THIS IS NOT MY FIRST RALLY. ALL OF THESE RALLIES ARE LIKE THIS. THE SPIRIT OF THIS COUNTRY IS UNBELIEVABLE. EVEN THE FAKE NEWS ADMITS WE HAVE MORE ENTHUSIASM THAN ANY CANDIDATE IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. AND HE HAS LESS ENTHUSIASM, IN MY OPINION, THAN ANY CANDIDATE. I THINK HE IS THE WEAKEST CANDIDATE IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS. NOW, WITH ALL OF THAT BEING SAID, THEY HAVE A CORRUPT MEDIA, THEY HAVE BIG TECH, THEY HAVE ALL OF THIS STUFF, IT'S A VERY POWERFUL PARTY. THEY HAVE ADVANTAGES. THEY AUTOMATICALLY WIN NEW YORK. I DON'T KNOW WHY, NEW YORK IS DOING SO BADLY. THEY AUTOMATICALLY WIN CALIFORNIA, I DON'T KNOW WHY, CALIFORNIA IS DOING SO BADLY. THE FOREST FIRES, THIS AND THAT, NO WATER. WE HAVE TO RUN THE TABLE. IT'S AUTOMATIC. WINNING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS A VERY, VERY HARD THING TO DO. WE JUST RAN THE STRAIN. IT'S A VERY HARD THING TO DO. BUT WE ARE WINNING IN FLORIDA. WE ARE WINNING HERE. YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING. LIKE, IF HE CAME HERE, SLEEPY JOE, IF HE CAME HERE, HONESTLY, THEY WOULD WORK REALLY HARD TO TRY TO FIND PEOPLE. I REALLY MEAN THIS. WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS THIS THING GOES WAY BACK. I WISH THEY WOULD MOVE THESE GUYS BACK A HUNDRED YARDS. I AM TELLING MY PEOPLE I WILL SAVE A LITTLE TIME. MY PEOPLE, PLEASE, FROM NOW ON, CAN YOU PLEASE MOVE THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA BACK LIKE ANOTHER HUNDRED YARDS. I HOPE YOU ARE LISTENING, TOO. YOU KNOW WHAT? THOSE CAMERAS HAVE MAGNIFIERS. YOU CAN GET A LOT OF PEOPLE. SO INSTEAD OF STANDING BEHIND THE CAMERA AND LOOKING AT THE CAMERAMAN'S ASKED, WE DON'T NEED THAT, JUST MOVE THEM BACK AND WE GET MORE PEOPLE BACK HERE BECAUSE IT GOES ON FOREVER. WE LOVE IT, THANK YOU, BUT WE ARE GOING TO MOVE IT BACK. MOVE THEM BACK. THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN IN GEORGIA, YOU KNOW. WE WILL HAVE A NEW T-SHIRT TOMORROW MORNING. MOVE THEM BACK. WELL, WE DID IT WITH CRAZY HUNTER, HUNTER BIDEN, REMEMBER? WHERE'S HUNTER? I KEPT SAYING WHERE THE HELL IS HUNTER? THEY CAUGHT HIM STEALING A LOT OF MONEY, SO HE DISAPPEARED. I SAID THAT'S A GREAT IDEA FOR A T-SHIRT. WE CAME OUT WITH A T-SHIRT, WHERE'S HUNTER? IT BECAME ONE OF THE BIG SUCCESSES. WHERE IS HUNTER? WE WERE TALKING TODAY ABOUT DRUG PRICES. IN THIS COUNTRY, WE HAVE A VERY BAD SYSTEM. WE HAVE MIDDLEMEN WHO ARE VERY RICH. I WAS TALKING ABOUT CUTTING OUT THE MIDDLEMEN, GOING WITH FAVORED NATIONS AND ALL OF THAT, GETTING DRUG PRICES DOWN 60%, 70%, 80%, BUT THE MIDDLEMAN MIDDLEMEN ARE MAKING ALL OF THIS MONEY, TREMENDOUSLY WEALTHY, THEY DON'T EVEN DO ANYTHING. AT LEAST THE DRUG COMPANIES MAKE THE DRUG. SO, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MIDDLEMEN, IT MUST BE HUNTER. HUNTER BIDEN. ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, CHINA AND UKRAINE, RUSSIA, US, HE'S A MIDDLEMAN. WHAT A FAMILY. BIDEN MADE A CORRUPT BARGAIN. THAT'S WHAT HE'S DONE. A CORRUPT BARGAIN IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION WHICH, BY THE WAY, SHOULD HAVE GONE TO BERNIE. ELIZABETH WARREN, POCAHONTAS, IF SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT A DAY BEFORE SUPER TUESDAY, JOE BIDEN WOULD NOT HAVE WON ANY OF THOSE STATES. THEY SPLIT UP THE VOTE. IT WAS SUPER LIBERAL HER AND CRAZY BERNIE. AND I SAY IT ALL THE TIME, I THINK BERNIE SANDERS IS THE NICEST, GREATEST LOSER I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT'S TRUE. AND I MEAN THIS. AND YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF THEIR VOTES. BECAUSE THE ONE THING BERNIE IS RIGHT ON, EVERY COUNTRY IN THIS WORLD, INCLUDING OUR SO-CALLED ALLIES EXCUSE ME. ARE THERE ANY CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE? OK, CLOSE YOUR EARS, CHILDREN, SCREWS US ON TRADE. BERNIE KNOWS THAT. THE PROBLEM IS HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I HAVE DONE A LOT ABOUT IT. WE HAVE A BIG PERCENTAGE OF BERNIE PEOPLE. THEY DIDN'T LIKE HILLARY. THEY DON'T LIKE JOE. WE ARE GOING TO GET A LOT OF BERNIE PEOPLE, SO I HAVE TO BE NICE TO BERNIE, BUT I CONSIDER HIM A REALLY GOOD LOSER. HE IS SO NICE ABOUT IT. THIS WAS IN A WAY WORSE BECAUSE ALL ELIZABETH WARREN HAD TO DO WAS LEAVE THE CAMPAIGN. DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO ENDORSE HIM AND HE WOULD HAVE WON EVERY SINGLE STATE ON SUPER TUESDAY, AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN, SO NOW WE HAVE A GUY WITH A LITTLE BIT LARGER BASE BUT NO ENERGY. HERE, WE WOULD'VE HAD SOMEBODY WITH A SMALLER BASE BUT WITH TREMENDOUS ENERGY. NOT AS MUCH ENERGY AS WE DO, AND WE HAVE A BIG BASS, SO I LIKE THAT. A LONG, COMPLEX STORY, BUT WHAT THE HELL? I HAVE NOTHING BUT TIME, RIGHT? WHAT THE HELL. IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION, HE HAS HANDED CONTROL YOU KNOW THAT. IN EXCHANGE FOR THE SOCIALIST'S, AND THE MARQUIS MARXISTS, AND THE FAR LEFT LUNATICS. IF HE WINS, THE RADICAL LEFT WILL BE RUNNING THIS COUNTRY. THEY ARE ADDICTED TO POWER. GOD HELP OUR COUNTRY IF THAT HAPPENS. YOU WILL NEVER MAKE A COMEBACK. IT WILL BE A LARGE-SCALE VERSION OF VENEZUELA. I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR A YEAR BUT I NEVER MEANT IT LIKE I MEAN IT NOW. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE SIZE. THE IDEOLOGY IS THE SAME. VENEZUELA WAS ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRIES. IT HAD OIL. IT HAD EVERYTHING. VERY MAGNIFICENT. NOW THEY DON'T HAVE WATER. THEY DON'T HAVE MEDICINE. THEY DON'T HAVE FOOD. EVERYONE IS FLEEING THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE SIZE. BUT THE IDEOLOGY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT PORTLAND. I SAID GOVERNOR OF OREGON, LET US COME IN. I WANT TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM. BUT THEORETICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS, IT IS THE CRAZIEST THING. THAT IS WHAT VENEZUELA IS. THEY ARE ANARCHISTS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE CITIES, THEY ARE ANARCHISTS. THE PRESS WANTS TO CALL THEM PEACEFUL PROTEST. WE ORIGINALLY HAD A HARD TIME. THEY DIDN'T WANT US TO HAVE ANY RALLIES IN CERTAIN STATES. AND THEN I REALIZED, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GO TO CHURCH. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE DINNER WITH PEOPLE. UNLESS IN MICHIGAN, WHO HAPPEN TO BE MARRIED TO THE GOVERNOR YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GO SAILING ALESSI WITH MARY TO THE GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN. REMEMBER THAT? DID SHE GET CAUGHT OR WHAT? NOW, SHE'S BLAMING ME BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. IT WAS ARE PEOPLE THAT CAUGHT THEM. ALWAYS TRUMP'S FAULT. YET, WE DID HER A FAVOR. WHO KNOWS? BUT, WE ARE DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE SPIRIT LIKE NO ONE'S EVER HAD SPIRIT. THERE'S GOING TO BE A RED WAVE NEXT. IT'S GOING TO BE UNBELIEVABLE. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT IT. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF EQUIPMENT, AND THEY WILL NEVER TURN IT AROUND TO SHOW THOSE PEOPLE BACK THERE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SAY DONALD TRUMP HAD A RALLY IN GEORGIA. THERE WAS A SMATTERING OF PEOPLE, A SMALL SMATTERING. IT'S AMAZING. NO ONE'S EVER HAD WHAT WE HAVE. THEY CALL IT A RED WAVE. ONE OF THE CHARACTERS STANDING RIGHT THERE. DON'T SAY THERE COULD BE, THERE WILL BE. THERE'S GOING TO BE A WAVE. THEY DON'T WANT TO GO THE PHONY, UNSOLICITED BALLOT. THEY SENT BALLOTS OUT BY THE MILLIONS. THEY DO HAVE AN IDEA WHERE IT IS GOING. WE SAY WHO'S SENDING THEM? WHERE ARE THEY GOING? WHO'S GETTING THEM? WHO IS DELIVERING THEM? WHO IS SIGNING THEM? WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING? IF YOU SAY THAT, THEY GO HE'S NOT FOR FREEDOM. THEY KNOW BETTER THAN YOU DO, IT'S A BIG CON JOB. WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE BALLOTS BECAUSE THEY FIND BALLOTS IN A GARBAGE CAN LAST WEEK. MILITARY BALLOTS THAT HAD THE NAME TRUMP ON THEM AND THEY ARE IN A GARBAGE CAN. THEY FOUND 50,000 BALLOTS FROM OHIO. THEY FIND THEM FROM NORTH CAROLINA DUMPED IN A RIVER. THEY FIND THEM, I THINK 500,000 BALLOTS IN VIRGINIA. THEY WERE INCORRECT. THEY'RE PRINTING THEM WRONG. THEY HAD ONE PROBLEM ON ONE SET OF BALLOTS. THEY FORGOT TO PUT THE NAME OF DONALD TRUMP ON THE BALLOT. OTHER THAN THAT, THE BALLOT WAS NO, THIS IS SERIOUS. I'M BEING SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING A TREMENDOUS DISSERVICE. THEY ARE USING COVID AS THE REASON. THEY ARE USING THIS AS A REASON NOT TO GO OUT AND VOTE. SO, WE VOTED IN WORLD WAR I. BY THE WAY, YOU HAD A PANDEMIC THAT MADE THIS LOOK LIKE PEANUTS, OK? WORLD WAR I. THEY VOTED IN WORLD WAR I. THEY VOTED IN WORLD WAR II. THEY VOTED DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION. THEY VOTED, VOTED. BUT, WE CAN'T DO THAT. YOU HAVE TO SEND IN A BALLOT. SO COMPLICATED. THEY HAVE INSTRUCTIONS. YOU DO THE BALLOT AND THEN YOU DO THIS. SOME OF THEM MAKE IT NICE AND SIMPLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO VERIFY. WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU IS WE HAVE WON A LOT OF COURT CASES. HOW ABOUT YOU PUT YOUR BALLOT IN AND IT HAS TO BE IN BY NOVEMBER 3? YOU HAVE TWO WEEKS TO COUNT THEM. DOES THAT MEAN WE HAVE TO HOLD UP THE WHOLE ELECTION? I WANT TO FIND OUT WHO WON OR LOST, I WANT TO FIND OUT LEGITIMATELY ON NOVEMBER 3. I'M NOT LOOKING TO FIND OUT I'M NOT LOOKING TO FIND OUT ON NOVEMBER 19 OR ON DECEMBER 1 OR ON TWO YEARS FROM NOW. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE BALLOT SCHEMES, IN NEW YORK, WE HAD A THIRD GRADE POLITICIAN NAMED CAROLYN MALONEY. SHE USED TO COME TO MY OFFICE ALL THE TIME FOR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. SHE WON A RACE. THE NUMBER OF BALLOTS MISSING, THEY HAVE NO IDEA. HER OPPONENT, IT WAS VERY CLOSE, HER OPPONENT HAS GONE TOTALLY NUTS AND HE SHOULD. YOU LOOK AT THAT, YOU LOOK AT PATERSON, NEW JERSEY. YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN VIRGINIA. THESE ARE RACES THAT TOOK PLACE RECENTLY. I MUST SAY, EVEN IN 2018, THEY HAD A LOT OF DISASTERS. EVEN IN 2016, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT, BUT THEY HAD A LOT OF BALLOTS. I PROMISE YOU, IT WILL BE AGAINST US, OK? IT WILL BE AGAINST US. BUT YOU LOOK AT NEVADA, WE HAVE A GOOD CHANCE TO WIN NEVADA BUT THEY ARE SENDING BALLOTS TO EVERYBODY. THE GOVERNOR WAS A BACK ROOM POLITICIAN. AND I DON'T WANT HIM HAVING THE FATE OF AN ELECTION I DON'T THINK IT IS RIGHT HE HAS THE FATE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION EVER IN HIS HANDS. I DON'T WANT THAT. IF YOU SEE ANYTHING WRONG, LAW ENFORCEMENT'S WATCHING, U.S. MARSHALS ARE WATCHING. SAME TYPE OF GUYS, NO GAMES. ONE THING I WILL SAY, LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE ON OUR SIDE. I SAID IT DURING THE DEBATE WITH JOE. JOE, NAME ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP THAT IS SUPPORTING YOU, HE COULDN'T DO IT. HE WAS BAILED OUT BY CHRIS WALLACE. I SAID NAME ONE LAW-ENFORCEMENT HERE, JOE, JUST SAY THE WORDS LAW AND ORDER. HE DIDN'T WANT TO SAY IT. JOE, JUST SAY THE WORDS LAW AND ORDER. THAT'S NOT HARD. JOE, LAW AND ORDER. HE COULDN'T SAY IT, HE WOULDN'T SAY IT. I THINK HE SAID LAW AND ORDER AND SAFETY AND SECURITY. HE HAS TO GET THE VOTE OF THE RADICAL LEFT AND THEY DON'T LIKE LAW AND ORDER. YOU KNOW WHO LIKES TRUMP BECAUSE OF LAW AND ORDER? THESE SUBURBAN WOMEN. I KEEP HEARING, BECAUSE THEY WANT LAW AND ORDER. I GOT LOOK AT THAT. THANK YOU. SAME THING HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO. SAME THING. THEY SAID WOMEN WILL NOT VOTE FOR TRUMP. THEN, THE ELECTION IS OVER, THEY SAID, MAN, THE WOMEN REALLY CAME OUT AND VOTED FOR TRUMP, RIGHT? THEY KEEP SAYING SUBURBAN WOMEN. I GOT RID OF A REGULATION THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE VALUES OF YOUR HOMES, OK? AND WOULD HAVE MAJOR HOMES VERY UNSAFE. WITH LOW INCOME HOUSING BEING BUILT ALL OVER THE PLACE. I TERMINATED IT. EVEN MY PEOPLE, THEY SAID WE CAN MAKE IT MCUH UCH WEAKER. I WANTED IT TERMINATED AND I TERMINATED IT. SERVESUBURBAN WOMEN, PLEASE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NO, I HEARD THEY LIKE MY POLICY BUT THEY DON'T LIKE MY PERSONALITY. I SAID, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT MY PERSONALITY. THEY WANT TO BE SAFE AND THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR AMERICAN DREAM. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT MY PERSONALITY. I THINK IT'S OK. THEY LIKE MY PERSONALITY. AND I LIKE THEM, I LIKE THEM. I LOVE THEM. THE RADICAL LEFT IS HELL BENT ON DESTROYING EVERYTHING THAT WE LOVE AND CHERISH. IT'S THAT CULTURE STUFF. CANCEL CULTURE. THEY WANT CANCEL CULTURE. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF OUR GREAT HEROES FROM THE PAST. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF OUR HISTORY. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF OUR CULTURE. I WAS AT MOUNT RUSHMORE. THEY WANT TO BLOW NOT RUSHMORE UP. I SAID TO OUR GREAT GOVERNOR OF SOUTH DAKOTA, IT'S NEVER HAPPENING, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WE DON'T EVEN NEED YOUR HELP FOR THIS ONE. IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. THEY WANT TO BLOW IT UP. I SAID, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. NONE OF THAT STUFF IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I WILL TELL YOU, A FEW MONTHS AGO, IF I WEREN'T YOUR PRESIDENT, YOU WOULD HAVE HAD THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL, THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL THEY WANT TO ATTACK EVEN LINCOLN. HE'S PROBABLY LOOKING DOWN AND SAYING WHAT THE HELL DID I DO? I WAS ON THEIR SIDE, I THINK, RIGHT? THEY WANT TO ATTACK THE LINCOLN. IF I WAS IN YOUR PRESIDENT, THEY WOULD HAVE ATTACKED THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL AND I STOPPED IT. I STOPPED A LOT OF THINGS. I ALSO SAVED YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT, BY THE WAY. THEY WANT TO PUNISH THE MIDDLE-CLASS, EXPUNGE EVERY LAST TRACE OF TRADITIONAL VALUES AND REPLACE THE AMERICAN DREAM WITH A SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS GONE CRAZY, BUT THEY HAVE CONTEMPT FOR AMERICA. THEY HAVE CONTEMPT FOR THE UNITED STATES. I DON'T THINK BIDEN DOES, BUT BIDEN HAS NO POWER. HE'S GONE, UP HERE, HE'S GONE. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS PROUD OF AMERICA. WE ARE PROUD OF AMERICA. WE LOVE AMERICA. WE CELEBRATE AMERICAN VALUES, AMERICAN HISTORY AND AMERICAN CULTURE. AND WE ARE WORKING TO DELIVER A TRULY EXTRAORDINARY AMERICAN FUTURE, BUT I WANT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO GET TOUGHER BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THEY ARE VERY GOOD PEOPLE BUT THEY ARE NOT TOUGH ENOUGH IN TERMS OF OUR VALUES AND WHAT WE STAND FOR. THEY LET THESE OTHER PEOPLE, THESE LUNATICS GET AWAY WITH THINGS LIKE YOU CAN'T SPY ON A CAMPAIGN, YOU CAN'T TRY AND TAKE OVER A DULY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND GET CAUGH T. AND WHEN YOU GET CAUGHT, YOU HAVE TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRAT SOCIALISTS WILL KILL YOUR JOBS, DISMANTLE YOUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS YOU SEE THAT GOING ALL OVER WITH SEATTLE. BY THE WAY, SEATTLE, THEY KNEW WE WERE GOING IN THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE NIGHT BEFORE, THEY RAISED THEIR HANDS AND LEFT. VERY SIMPLE. I SAID, THAT'S IT. WHETHER THEY LIKE US OR NOT, WE ARE GOING IN. THEY TOOK OVER A BIG PIECE OF THE CITY. THEY WEREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING. THE NIGHT BEFORE, THEY SAID, THESE ARE LITTLE FACTS I GIVE YOU JUST TO GIVE YOU. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO ASK US, THE GOVERNORS. THESE RADICAL LEFT IF YOU LOOK AT REPUBLICAN RUN STATE AND CITIES, THEY ARE DOING PHENOMENALLY WELL. IF YOU LOOK AT THESE RADICAL LEFT LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BEAUTIFUL NEW YORK. SINCE I LEFT, THREE AND A HALF YEARS, IT WAS DOING GREAT. I LEFT. MAYBE IT IS, BUT I LEFT. I CAME TO WASHINGTON. WHAT'S HAPPENED TO NEW YORK, WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO THAT INCREDIBLE CITY AND STATE IS SO SAD. LOOK AT CHICAGO. LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON.ATLANTA , LOOK AT ATLANTA, IT IS SO SAD WHAT'S GOING ON. THESE ARE RADICAL LEFT. NO BAIL, NO CASH BAIL, NO NOTHING. YOU KILL SOMEBODY, NO PROBLEM. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH IT MUCH LONGER. THEY WANT TO DISSOLVE YOUR BORDERS, RELEASE CRIMINAL ALIENS, RAISE YOUR TAXES. BY THE WAY, I'M CUTTING YOUR TAXES BIG. BIDEN THIS GUY. BIDEN WANTS TO SUBSTANTIALLY RAISE YOUR TAXES. HE SAYS I'M ONLY TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE NO, HE WANTS TO TERMINATE THE TAX CUTS WE GAVE YOU. THAT'S $2000. YOU LOOK AT THE ENERGY CUTS AND THE CHILD TAX CREDIT, IT'S $1000 EACH. IT'S $7,000, $8,000 A FAMILY. IF YOU ARE GOING TO TERMINATE IT, THAT MEANS THAT IS $9,000. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. THEN, HE PULLS OUT A PIECE OF PAPER AND STARTS READING IT. HE DID THAT YESTERDAY. HE PULLED OUT A PIECE OF PAPER BECAUSE HE COULDN'T REMEMBER THE NUMBERS. GEORGE IS SITTING THERE WATCHING THIS. HE DIDN'T TREAT ME AS NICE. I DID HIM TWO WEEKS AGO AND HE WAS FINE. IT IS WHAT IT IS. HE'S GOING TO ASK ME A QUESTION. YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION? HE ASKED YOU A QUESTION, I GIVE HIM AN ANSWER. YOU CAN'T DO ANY BETTER THAN THAT. THEY WERE PRETTY NASTY. NOT TERRIBLE. LAST NIGHT WAS - -SHE WAS OUT OF LINE, IN MY OPINION. SHE WAS OUT OF LINE. AS I SAID, JUST RELAX. WHEN YOU WATCH THE ONE THE WEEK BEFORE, IT'S SUCH A DIFFERENCE. THE BEAUTY IS THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY GET IT. THEY'RE SMART. THEY GET IT BETTER THAN NBC OWNED BY COMCAST. I CALL IT 'CON' CAST. THEY SPEND A FORTUNE ON PUBLIC RELATIONS AND I GO AND CALL THEM 'CONCAST.' THEY WANT TO CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS, DRIVE GOD FROM THE PUBLIC SQUARE, AND ABOLISH TO DEFEND OUTR CONSTITUTION FROM THIS MADNESS, I PROBABLY NOMINATED JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. SHE'S GREAT, SHE'S SO SMART. SHE'S SO SMART, RIGHT? SHE'S DONE A GREAT JOB. SHE WENT THROUGH IT NO PROBLEM. THEY CAME AT HER. IT WAS LIKE YOUR ATLANTA TEAM WHEN THEY WERE GOOD A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. HOW THE HELL DID THEY LOSE THAT SUPER BOWL? HOW THE HELL DID THAT HAPPEN? I KEEP THINKING IF YOU OWN THAT TEAM AND WORK FOR THAT TEAM, THAT WAS A LONG SHOT. IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS. IT WAS LIKE THAT TEAM PLAYING A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM, RIGHT? SHE WAS SO MUCH MORE TALENTED THAN THOSE PEOPLE ARE THAT WERE TRYING TO EMBARRASS HER. THE COOLEST WAS DO YOU HAVE NOTES, DO YOU HAVE NOTES? RIGHT? I DON'T HAVE NOTES EITHER, RIGHT? MOST OF THIS HAS BEEN OFF THE TELEPROMPTER. MANY OF YOU WOULD SAY THIS IS A LITTLE BORING, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, SAM. LAST NIGHT, BIDEN REFUSED TO RULE OUT COURT PACKING. THEY MAY TAKE 16, 17, 18 PEOPLE. HE WILL PACK THE COURT WITH RADICAL LEFT JUDGES WHO WILL SHRED YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT, DISARM LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS, AND PROTECT TERRORISTS AND VIOLENT CRIMINALS. I WON THE BAN FROM JIHADIST COUNTRIES OR OTHER COUNTRIES. IF PEOPLE ARE BAD, WE DON'T WANT THEM IN. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE THAT CAN'T LOVE OUR COUNTRY. WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE THAT WILL HURT OUR COUNTRY. I HAVE A BAN. VERY CONTROVERSIAL. WE WANTED THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND WE DON'T LET PEOPLE IN FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES THAT ARE GOING TO LOOK TO DO BAD THINGS TO US. PRETTY AMAZING WHAT'S HAPPENED. BIDEN'S AGENDA WILL ALSO BE A CATASTROPHE FOR GEORGIA SENIORS, SENIORS. DO WE HAVE ANY SENIORS IN THE HOUSE? RIGHT? PROUD TO BE SENIORS, RIGHT? FOR YEARS, BIDEN TRIED CUT YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY AND YOUR MEDICARE. NOW BIDEN IS PLEDGING MASS AMNESTY AND FREE HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS, DECIMATING MEDICARE AND DESTROYING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. WE ALL I HAVE A HEART. I DON'T WANT TO HURT PEOPLE. ONCE YOU SAY COME IN, YOU WILL GET FREE HEALTH CARE, FREE EDUCATION, THE WHOLE WORLD WILL WANT TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO EVEN COME CLOSE TO AFFORDING IT. I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR SENIORS. I CAN'T TAKE CARE OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE NO INTENTION OF COMING HERE BEFORE THESE MANIACS MAY THESE PLEDGES. HE'LL BANKRUPT THESE PROGRAMS THAT FINANCED THE LEFT. OPEN BORDERS. WE WERE JUST FINISHING UP THE WALL. THEY WANT TO TAKE THE WALL DOWN, SOME OF THEM. THIS WALL GOES DEEP AND HIGH. A LOT OF BAD PEOPLE ARE NOT COMING IN. THEY WANT TO TAKE IT DOWN. WHILE I'M PRESIDENT, NO ONE WILL TOUCH YOUR MEDICARE. NO ONE WILL TOUCH YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP, WE'RE DELIVERING A SAFE VACCINE AND A RAPID RECOVERY. I LOVE THE RECOVERY BECAUSE HERE I AM. TWO WEEKS AGO, I WAS NOT EXACTLY FEELING GREAT. WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT, I TOLD THIS TODAY, WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT, YOU GET A LOT OF DOCTORS. JOHNS HOPKINS, WALTER REED, YOU GET ALL THE GREAT HOSPITALS. YOU GOT THESE GENIUSES ALL OVER THE PLACE. LET ME DOT HI THIS. JUST LEAVE ME ALONE, FELLA. S. I WAS NOT FEELING TOO GREAT. THEY GAVE ME SOMETHING, REGENERON. A DAY LATER, I FELT LIKE SUPERMAN. HEY, WHATEVER THATE HELL THAT STUFF WAS BRAND NEW, DEVELOPED BECAUSE OF THIS. WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL. WE ARE GOING TO GET IT FOR EVERY PERSON THAT WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE, OR IN OTHER WORDS, EVERY PERSON THAT NEEDS IT. THEY CAN CALL IT A THERAPEUTIC, BUT TO ME IT WAS A CURE, BECAUSE THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT WE'VE GOT MORE DOCTORS. IF ANYONE GETS SICK, IT'S A GREAT TIME WHEN I'M AROUND BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE 15 DOCTORS STANDING OVER YOU IN ABOUT NINE SECONDS. IT'S HAPPENED MANY TIMES. SOMEBODY GETS NOT SO WELL AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GET THE GREATEST DOCTORS YOU'VE EVER SEEN. BUT, THIS WAS ALL DEVELOPED VERY RECENTLY, MONTHS AGO. IT'S INCREDIBLE THE STRIDES WE HAVE MADE. IF YOU VOTE FOR ME, PROSPERITY WILL SURGE. I WANT A NORMAL LIFE LIKE WE HAD SEVEN MONTHS AGO. WE DON'T WANT WE WANT A NORMAL LIFE. THAT WILL RESUME. NEXT YEAR WILL BE ONE OF THE GREATEST YEARS ECONOMICALLY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE ARE GOING. THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A TRUMP RECOVERY AND A BIDEN DEPRESSION. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. HE'S GOING TO QUADRUPLE YOUR TAXES, RAISE TAXES ON BUSINESSES. ALL THE BUSINESSES THAT MOVED INTO OUR COUNTRY WILL MOVE OUT. YOU WILL HAVE A DISASTER. YOU WILL HAVE A DEPRESSION THE LIKES OF WHICH THIS COUNTRY HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE IF THESE CRAZY RULES THE THREE NEW DEAL. THE GREEN NEW DEAL, THE REAL NUMBER IS $100 TRILLION. THEY SAY WE CAN DO IT FOR LIKE $9 TRILLION. $9 TRILLION DOES NOT WORK EITHER. THE REAL PRICE IS $100 TRILLION. THEY WANT TO RIP DOWN BUILDINGS AND BUILD NEW BUILDINGS WITH TINY LITTLE WINDOWS. I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP MY WINDOW, HAVE A NICE VIEW OF GEORGIA. THINK OF IT. $100 TRILLION. SO, IF WE HAD AN UNBELIEVABLE ECONOMIC SURGE THAT LASTED 100 YEARS WITHOUT A PROBLEM, WE WOULD IT MAKE $100 TRILLION. THIS IS THE CRAZIEST THING DONE BY AOC PLUS THREE WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT. SHE DOESN'T KNOW. SHE'S GOT A GREAT LINE OF BULLSHIT, THAT'S ABOUT IT. IT'S TRUE. SHE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT. AOC PLUS THREE. THESE WERE NOT GREAT ACADEMICS. HOW ABOUT ILL HANDHAN OMAR? I'M GOING TO WIN MINNESOTA BECAUSE OF ILHAN OMAR. SHE HATES OUR COUNTRY. YOU SEE THE WAY SHE TALKS, SHE HATES OUR COUNTRY. NO, PLEASE DON'T TELL HER TO LEAVE. THAT HAPPENED ONCE BEFORE. THEY START SCREAMING SHE SHOULD LEAVE AND THEY GOT ME IN TROUBLE. WHY DID HE PROTEST? SHE DOESN'T LIKE OUR COUNTRY. I AM GOING TO WIN. REMEMBER THIS, MINNESOTA HAS NOT BEEN WON SINCE 1972 AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN MINNESOTA BECAUSE OF ILHAN OMAR. WELL, HAVING MINNEAPOLIS RIPPED DOWN, BURNED DOWN THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED US ON DAY ONE. DAY ONE. THE PROBLEM IS THEY KEEP WAITING. HOW ABOUT THE CNN REPORTER? THE SHAVED HEAD. MAYBE I WILL TRY THAT SOMEDAY. I DON'T KNOW. MY POLL NUMBERS MIGHT GO DOWN OR THEY MIGHT GO UP, YOU NEVER KNOW. BUT HE'S STANDING THERE, THIS IS A FRIENDLY PROTEST. BEHIND HIM, THE FIRE IS LIKE NINE BLOCKS LONG. IT LOOKS LIKE BERLIN DURING THE WORST DAYS OF THEIR LIVES. THE FIRES ARE RAGING. THIS IS A FRIENDLY PROTEST. OH, BOY, OH,B BOY. THEN THE NATIONAL GUARD STARTED MOVING FORWARD. HE GOT HIT IN THE KNEE WITH A CANISTER OF TEARGAS AND HE WENT DOWN. I'VE BEEN HURT, I'VE BEEN INJURED. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. THEY DON'T REPORT THE VIOLENCE, THE LOOTING ON CNN, MSCNC, ALL THESE DIFFERENT NETWORKS. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEM. THEY WANT TO THINK EVERYTHING IS WONDERFUL. IT'S NOT. THE REASON IT'S NOT, A LOT OF IT IS BECAUSE OF THEM. I WILL DELIVER OPTIMISM, OPPORTUNITY AND HELP. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE THIS KIND OF SPIRIT. I HATE TO SAY IT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO INSULT GEORGIANS, BUT IT'S THIS WAY ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE THE BIGGEST RALLIES IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS. NOBODY HAS RALLIES LIKE THIS. LOOK AT THE PEOPLE. LOOK. IM MEAN, YOU CAN'T SEE THIS. THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK, YOU CANNOT EVEN SEE HOW FAR BACK. I CAN'T EVEN SEE THE END OF IT. WE HAVE THE GREATEST ENTHUSIASM, THE BIGGEST CROWDS IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS. THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM. THEY WILL SAY YES, A SMATTERING OF PEOPLE. THAT IS TRUE. THEY ASKED THE FIRST LADY, HOW DID YOU LIKE IT? WERE THERE MANY PEOPLE? THEY DIDN'T SHOW IT. THEY JUST SHOW YOUR FACE. SHE SAID, BUT I COULD HEAR IT. WHEN YOU GO TO A GEORGIA FOOTBALL GAME, WHEN THEY ARE DOING WELL, YOU CAN'T IMITATE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. BIDEN HAD A RALLY PEOPLE. LIKE 13 PEOPLE SHOWED UP AND THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. THEY SAY, THE ONE GUY MADE A MISTAKE AND CALLED HIM SLEEPY JOE. THAT GUY'S JOB IS DONE. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS HERE TODAY. HE'S MAKING A SPEECH ON THE ENVIRONMENT. HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. THEY DON'T SAY THERE'S NOBODY THERE. THEY'VE GOT THE CIRCLES. LIKE FIVE CIRCLES. HE GOES THERE AND PEOPLE ARE STANDING. NOT ONLY ARE THEY BIG THE GUY DOES A REALLY NICE JOB. REALLY NEAT, BEAUTIFUL, SOLID. I MEAN, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CATCH ANYTHING IF YOU ARE IN ONE OF THOSE CIRCLES BECAUSE YOU ARE SO FAR AWAY. BUT, I NEVER JOKE ABOUT IT. I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY FOR SLEEPY JOE TO CONSTANTLY HE WALKS ONTO A STAGE. NUMBER ONE, THERE'S NO PEOPLE THERE. THE FEW PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE ARE LIKE, WHAT, 50 YARDS AWAY? THE MASK IS ALWAYS SO LARGE. IT COVERS THE WHOLE I SHOULDN'T JOKE. I SHOULDN'T JOKE. YOU KNOW WHAT? RUNNING AGAINST THE WORST CANDIDATE IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS PUTS PRESSURE ON THE. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF I LOSE? MY WHOLE LIFE, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? I'M GOING TO SAY I LOST OF THE WORST CANDIDATE IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS. I'M NOT GOING TO FEEL SO GOOD. MAYBE I WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, I DON'T KNOW. BIDEN WILL DELIVER PESSIMISM AND DECLINE. AGAIN, HE HE'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR 47 YEARS. HE SAYS WHY DIDN'T TRUMP MOVE FASTER? WELL, WHEN I PUT IN THE BAN ON CHINA WHEN THEY WERE HEAVILY INFECTED AND EUROPE SHORTLY THEREAFTER, BIDEN KAI FOR ME XENOPHOBIC. TELL ME WHAT THAT MEANS. PLEASE TELL ME. HE WAS UNABLE TO DEFINE IT. HE WROTE IT DOWN. XENOPHOBIC. AND HE CALLS ME A RACIST, I THINK, BECAUSE IT WAS SO EARLY. NOW TIME GOES BY AND HE SAYS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT EARLIER. BUT, HE WAS MONTHS BEHIND ME, REMEMBER? HE THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIBLE WE CLOSED DOWN TO CHINA. FAUCI SAID VERY NICELY TRUMP SAVED THOUSANDS OF LIVES BY MAKING THAT DECISION. TO BE HONEST, I WAS JUST ABOUT THE ONLY ONE WHO WANTED TO DO IT. JOE BIDEN WOULD TERMINATE OUR RECOVERY, DELAY THE VACCINE, PROLONG THE PANDEMIC AND ANNIHILATE GEORGIA'S ECONOMY. AND YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. YOU HAVE A GOVERNOR THAT'S WORKING HARD AND HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE'S HERE, BUT HE'S WORKING HARD AND IS DOING A GREAT JOB. WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT. YOU'VE GOT A GREAT FIRST LADY. WE ARE WORKING TO SAFELY REOPEN THE SCHOOLS. REOPEN THE SCHOOLS. GET THOSE SCHOOLS OPEN ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. IT IS SO BAD. BARRON, RIGHT? BARRON TESTED POSITIVE, MY SON. I SAID ARE YOU OK? IU'M OK. TWO SECONDS LATER, HE'S OK NOW. BECAUSE HE HAS A GREAT IMMUNE SYSTEM. 99.9-SOMETHING PERCENT. THEY ARE YOUNG AND STRONG FOR THIS PARTICULAR DISEASE. THE FLU, THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN, REAL DEATH PROBLEMS. FOR THIS, IT IS 99.99-SOMETHING. BARRON TESTED POSITIVE. THE FIRST LADY IS DOING GREAT. A GREAT JOB. SHE DIDN'T DO THE REGENERON THING. SHE DID IT THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY, SHE GOT BETTER. BARRON, YOUNG KID, HEALTHY KID, BUT HE TESTED POSITIVE. BY THE TIME I GOT TO SPEAK TO THE DOCTOR, HOW'S HE DOING? HE'S OK NOW. IT'S GONE? YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS. AND THEN YOU ARE IMMUNE. BARRON EVERYONE LOVES BARRON. DO YOU THINK HE'S TALL ENOUGH? A TALL YOUNG GUY. BUT, HE'S DOING GOOD. IT'S AN AMAZING THING. THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL. WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR SENIORS VERY MUCH. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING, BUT WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR SENIORS AND WE HAVE TO PROTECT CERTAIN GROUPS ESPECIALLY OUR SENIORS WHERE THEY HAVE A HEART PROBLEM OR DIABETES PROBLEM. WE'VE GOT TO GET OUR BUSINESS IS OPEN. IN YOUR CASE, YOUR GOVERNOR WAS VERY EARLY, HE DID A GREAT JOB. YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO NEW YORK, YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MICHIGAN. WE WON THE COSASE. SHE WAS KEEPING EVERYBODY IN PRISON, EXCEPT HER HUSBAND. NO, SHE WAS KEEPING EVERYONE IN PRISON. PENNSYLVANIA, THEY GOT TO OPEN THE STATE. WE ARE GOING TO DO WELL IN PENNSYLVANIA, TOO, WATCH. NORTH CAROLINA, WE HAVE MARK MEADOWS HERE FROM NORTH CAROLINA. OUR GREAT CHIEF OF STAFF. WHERE IS MARK? OUR GREAT CHIEF OF STAFF. HE'S WORKING. HE'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL CONGRESSMAN AND HE HAS BEEN DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. WHERE IS MARK? HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB. IS IT AN EASY JOB, MARK? NO PROBLEM. BUT, BIDEN WILL CLOSE YOUR CLASSROOMS. YOU KNOW THAT. HE SAID THE OTHER DAY HE WILL FOLLOW SCIENCE. THAT MEANS IF FAUCI SAYS CLOSE IT UP, HE WILL CLOSE OF THE COUNTRY? NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, THE NUMBERS ARE GREAT. HE WANTS TO THROW YOUR CHILDREN OUT OF THE SCHOOL, CLOSE UP YOUR SCHOOLS AND SHUT DOWN YOUR WORKPLACE. WE ARE SETTING RECORDS FOR EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, ALL SORTS OF RECORDS ECONOMICALLY. EUROPE, WHICH HAS IMPOSED PUNISHING, HORRIBLE, REALLY STRONG LOCKDOWNS, IS NOW EXPERIENCING A MASSIVE SURGE IN CASES. THE FAKE NEWS WOULD SAY LOOK AT EUROPE. WE ARE DOING BETTER THAN EUROPE, BUT NOW EUROPE IS EXPLODING. THEY WILL BE OK, BUT THEY ARE EXPLODING. BIDEN'S PLAN WOULD CRUSH AMERICA. MY PLAN WOULD CRUSH THE VIRUS AND AMERICA WILL BE STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. SO, OUR EARLY AND AGGRESSIVE ACTION SAVED, I THINK AT LEAST 2 MILLION LIVES. WE PIONEERED LIFESAVING THERAPIES AND REDUCE THE FATALITY RATE 85%. THINK OF THAT. THAT IS OVER A SIX MONTH PERIOD. I'M WORKING TO MAKE THE ANTIBODY TREATMENT. I SAID IT AND I GOT IT. FOR ME, IT WAS GREAT AND I BET FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT IS GREAT. THESE ARE GREAT SCIENTISTS THAT CAME UP WITH THE SOME OTHER GREAT MEDICINES OF THE LAST 10 YEARS. ALSO, ELI LILLY, IT IS VERY SIMILAR. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE FOR FREE TO ANYBODY WHO NEEDS IT. FREE. SHOULD BE GETTING FINAL APPROVAL VERY SOON. I'M GETTING APPROVALS FROM THE FDA THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THREE YEARS TO GET. BUT IT'S POLITICAL. THEY COULD HAVE HAD IT FASTER. NOBODY WANTED ME TO GET THE APPROVAL BEFORE THE ELECTION. I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT THE ELECTION, I AM ABOUT SAVING LIVES. TO HELL WITH THE ELECTION. IT GOT A LITTLE POLITICAL. OPERATION WARP SPEED, WE WILL HAVE 100 MILLION VACCINE DOSES BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR, MAYBE SUBSTANTIALLY BEFORE THAT. THE VACCINE WILL END THE PANDEMIC ONCE AND FOR ALL. THEY HATE IT WHEN I SAIDY IT BECAUSE THE VACCINE IS LOOKING GREAT. NUMEROUS COMPANIES, JOHNSON & JOHNSON, MODERNA, ALL OF THEM, THEY ARE GREAT. YOU KNOW WHAT? WITHOUT THE VACCINE, IT IS ENDING TOO. IT IS ENDING WITHOUT THE VACCINE. THE VACCINE IS GOING TO MAKE IT GO QUICKER. LET'S GET RID OF IT. WE WANT IT TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. WE ARE JOINED TONIGHT BY A MAN WHO I AM SO PROUD THAT I GAVE A VERY EARLY ENDORSEMENT TO. I DID IT BECAUSE OF DAVID PURDUE. DAVID SAID, MR. PRESIDENT, I HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR. I SAID GOVERNOR OF WHERE? HE SAID THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA. I SAID, TELL ME, WHAT'S HIS STORY? TELL ME ABOUT HIM. I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH AND THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERED TO ME, HE'S ALL TRUMP ALL THE WAY. I DIDN'T KNOW HIM. A VERY SUCCESSFUL PAST. HE LIKES TRUMP. IT'S HARD TO ENDORSE PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE YOU. SOMEHOW I HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THAT. BUT I SAID WHAT'S HIS NAME? BRIAN KEMP AND HE'S A REALLY SMART GUY. I ENDORSED HIM. HE WENT ON TO WIN. HIS WONDERFUL WIFE IS EVEN BETTER THAN HIM. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WE CAMPAIGNED TOGETHER. WE CAMPAIGNED TOGETHER AND I MEAN, I HAVE NEVER SEEN WE CAMPAIGNED AGAINST STACY. WE HAD OPRAH. OPRH USED TO BE FRIEND OF MINE. SHE LIKED THE KEY LIME PIE. WANT TO DO THIS STUFF, YOU LOSE A LOT OF FRIENDS VERY QUICKLY. THAT'S OK. WE HAD BARACK OBAMA, MICHELLE OBAMA, THEY PRACTICALLY LIVED IN GEORGIA. ALL BRIAN HAD WAS TRUMP AND BRIAN WON FAIRLY EASILY. BRIAN KEMP. GREAT GUY. MARTY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S GREAT. HE'S A GREAT GOVERNOR AND HE WAS AHEAD OF THE CURVE. HE SAID WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS THING OPEN. THOSE ARE THE STATES THAT ARE DOING THE BEST. THE ONES THAT ARE DOING THESE LOCKDOWNS, NOT TO MENTION THE PROBLEMS CAUSED WITH DEPRESSION, DRUGS, UNCLE HALL IS HIM AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS. I WANT TO THANK BRIAN AND MARTY. YOU ARE DOING GOOD. HELLO MY DOING BY THE WAY? OVER GOING TO WIN IT? IF I DON'T, I WILL TAKE MY ENDORSEMENT AWAY. NO, YOU ARE DOING GREAT JOB AS GOVERNOR. BRIAN KEMP. ANOTHER GUY WHO HAS BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME, HE'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL MAN. HE DID WHAT I DID. HE WANTED TO GIVE BACK. HE LOVES THIS STATE LIKE CRAZY, HE LOVES OUR COUNTRY. HE'S CASTING A MOVIE AND I WANT TO PICK A SENATOR. YOU KNOW WHAT I DO? I'VE GOT TO GET DAVID PURDUE TO PLAY THE ROLE BUT HE'S RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY IN WASHINGTON. HE IS RESPECTED AND REVERED, AND HE BRINGS BACK THE BACON TO THIS STATE. HE CAME TO SEE ME. DAVID, STAND UP. HE CAME HE CAME TO SEE ME ABOUT THE FARMERS. THAT IS HOW I GOT INVOLVED IN THE WHOLE THING AND THE HURRICANE AND ALL THE DAMAGE. WE BROUGHT IN A LOT OF MONEY FOR OUR FARMERS IN GEORGIA, RIGHT? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU ARE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. CAN EVEN BELIEVE, THE GUIDE THAT IS RUNNING AGAINST HIM, I BEAT HIM ONCE BEFORE. TWO YEARS AGO, HE WAS RUNNING AGAINST A VERY GOOD KAREN HANDEL AND SHE'S DOING VERY WELL. HE WAS RUNNING AGAINST HER AND WE DEFEATED HIM. HE SAID HE'S RUNNING AGAINST DAVID. I SAID THIS GUY IS NOT IN THE SAME LEAGUE WITH DAVID PURDUE. I MEAN, THAT PUTS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON DAVID JUST LIKE I HAVE PRESSURE ON ME. IT PUTS PRESSURE ON DAVID. IT WILL BE EASIER TO RUN AGAINST SOMEONE WHO IS GOOD. HE'S A RADICAL LEFT, SCHUMER-PELOSI GUY. HE'S BAD ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT. HE DIDN'T EVEN LIVE IN THE DISTRICT. WE DEFEATED HIM ONCE AND I HEAR YOU WILL DEFEAT HIM AGAIN. THANK YOU, DAVID, THANK YOU. SO, A PERSON WHO HAS BECOME A FRIEND OF MINE AND BRIAN THOUGHT SHE WAS FANTASTIC. I SAID HOW WOULD YOU HANDLE PRESSURE? THIS IS A ROUGH, MEAN BUSINESS. I FOUND OUT SHE CAN HANDLE PRESSURE. SHE HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. SHE WAS WITH ME 100% ON THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX. SHE HAS BEEN WITH US THE WHOLE WAY AND SHE'S A GREAT WOMAN. HER HUSBAND IS A GREAT MAN AND VERY SUCCESSFUL MAN. SOME PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SAY THE HUSBAND IS A GREAT FAILURE, HIS WIFE IS BETTER. NO, HE'S A REALLY RESPECTED PERSON AND HE LOVES HIS WIFE. KELLY LEFFLER. KELLY, THANK YOU. GREAT JOB. GREAT JOB, KELLY. GREAT JOB. MY ONLY PROBLEM SHE IS RUNNING AGAINST ANOTHER GREAT GUY. I'M BACKING BOTH OF THEM BECAUSE DOUG COLLINS IS HERE. WHERE IS DOUG? BOY, AM I IN A LOUSY POSITION. I LIKE THEM BOTH, I LOVE THEM BOTH. HE HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLE WITH THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX AND EVERYTHING ELSE. HE'S A WARRIOR, SHE'S A WARRIOR. YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE? THEY ARE BOTH GOING TO THE POLLS, THEY WILL BRING THE PEOPLE WITH THEM. YOU KNOW WHO THE BIGGEST WINNER IS GOING TO BE? TRUMP BECAUSE EVERYBODY THAT VOTES FOR BOTH OF THEM IS GOING TO VOTE FOR ME. REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS, THEY ARE BOTH GOING TO BE WINNERS BECAUSE WHOEVER DOESN'T OFFICIALLY WIN IS GOING TO HAVE AN UNBELIEVABLE FUTURE AND I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE OF IT, OK? I MEAN IT. BUT WHAT A LOUSY POSITION TO BE IN, DAVID. OH, BOY. WE HAVE SOMEBODY JODEY. A WARRIOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EVERYTHING. ONLY LEADING THE DISTRICT BY 5000 POINTS SO WE ARE NOT WORRIED TOO MUCH. YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB, WE APPRECIATE IT. BARRY LOUDERMILK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT JOB, GREAT JOB. THESE ARE INCREDIBLE. RICK ALLEN. RICK, THANK YOU. ANOTHER ONE, A GUY WHO KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE FARMING INDUSTRY WHEN I WAS PICKING THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE, THEY HAD ALL THESE POLITICAL PEOPLE COME IN. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FARMS? NO, BUT A QUICK LEARNER. I'M INTERVIEWING THESE PEOPLE. I WENT THROUGH ABOUT NINE OF THEM, AND SO FAR, YOU KNOW WHAT CORN LOOKS LIKE? DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING? SOME OF THEM HAD ABSOLUTELY ZERO. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO A FARM? NO, SIR, BUT I'M WILLING TO LEARN. I MEET THIS GUY NAMED SONNY PERDUE. RIGHT? SONNY CAME. I REMEMBER THAT MEETING. SONNY CAME INTO MY OFFICE. BY THE WAY, DAVID CALLED AND SONNY CALLED ABOUT BRIAN. BOTH OF THEM. HE COMES INTO MY OFFICE AND I AM TELLING YOU, TO THIS DAY, I LEARNED MORE ABOUT FARMING AND THAT 45 MINUTE MEETING THAN I LEARNED EVER IN MY LIFE. I LEARNED IT ALL FROM YOU AND YOU HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB. YOU HAVE DELIVERED $28 BILLION AND ANOTHER $13 BILLION IS COMING FOR OUR FARMERS. HE HAS BEEN GREAT. AN INCREDIBLE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE. STAND UP AGAIN, SONNY. BY THE WAY, I GUESS HE WAS ALSO YOUR GOVERNOR FOR LIKE EIGHT YEARS, RIGHT? I DON'T EVEN COUNT THAT. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. HE WAS A VERY POPULAR GOVERNOR, BRIAN. BUT HE WAS YOUR GOVERNOR FOR EIGHT YEARS. HE HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE. THANK YOU. I'M GLAD I COULD SAY IT IN FRONT OF YOUR HOME FRIENDS. AND STATE REPRESENTATIVE VERNON JONES.

I SAY HE'S A GREAT GUY. OBVIOUSLY, I SAID HE'S A REPUBLICAN. THEY PUT THE THING ON THE BOTTOM, VERNON JONES, DEMOCRAT FROM WHEREVER THE HEALTHY COMES FROM. I SAID THERE MUST BE A TYPO. HE'S BETTER THAN ANY REPUBLICAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I CHECKED HIM OUT HE'S A DEMOCRAT WHO LOVES TRUMP AND WE LOVE HIM. THANK YOU. HE'S A POPULAR GUY. AMAZING. SPOKE AT TOUR CONVENTION. SOMEBODY WHO IS DOING A FANTASTIC JOB INSURING COMMISSIONER JOHN KING. APPRECIATE IT. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONERS BUBBA MCDONALD AND TRICIA PRIDEMORE. THANK YOU BOTH. THANK YOU.

DAVID, THANK YOU. HOW ARE WE DOING, GOOD? WAY UP. I SAW A POLL WE ARE WAY UP. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO IN POLITICS? DAVID PURDUE TOLD ME THIS. PRETEND YOU ARE ONE POINT DOWN AND WORK YOUR ASS OFF AND THEN JUST SIT HOME AND WATCH. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO. WAS THAT THE GREATEST EVENING EVER? BUT, THIS IS GOING TO BE BETTER. THIS IS GOING TO BE BETTER. THIS IS IN ITS OWN WAY EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. CANDIDATES FOR CONGRESS ANDREW CLYDE. THANK YOU. GOOD LUCK. I HEARD YOU ARE DOING REALLY WELL. AND SOMEBODY THAT I JUST THINK IT IS FANTASTIC. THIS ONE, I NEVER, EVER WANT TO HAVE HER AS MY ENEMY. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. SHE'S SO UNBELIEVABLE. YOU'RE SO UNBELIEVABLE. THANK YOU. I LOOK AT THE POLL NUMBERS HERE, YOU ARE REALLY UP. JUST PRETEND YOU ARE ONE POINT DOWN BUT YOU ARE DOING GREAT. CONGRATULATIONS, GREAT JOB. AND FINALLY, ANGELA STANTON KING. IT WILL BE ANOTHER GREAT VICTORY. THAT IS GOING TO BE A GREAT VICTORY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT JOB. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, WE HAVE A WOMEN WHO WON US THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. SHE WAS THE CHAIR OF MICHIGAN AND SHE KEPT BRINGING ME BACK AND BACK AND BACK. I SAID WHO IS THIS WOMAN? WE WON MICHIGAN BY THE WAY, WE ARE UP IN MICHIGAN. IT WAS JUST ANNOUNCED. WE HAVE A LOT OF CAR COMPANIES MOVING INTO MICHIGAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SHE'S DONE A FANTASTIC JOB. WHEN IT CAME TIME TO PICK THE HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, I SAID WHO WAS THAT WOMAN IN MICHIGAN WHO KEPT GETTING ME BACK THERE? EVERY WEEK, SIR, YOU HAVE TO COME BACK. MICHIGAN HAS NOT BEEN WON IN 38 YEARS. SHE SAID I AM TELLING YOU YOU ARE GOING TO WIN. EACH TIME I SAID THAT'S IT. SHE SAID THAT'S OK. THE NEXT DAY, I HAVE TO COME BACK. IT WAS ACTUALLY MY LAST STOP. 1:00 IN THE MORNING ELECTION DAY, WE HAD 32,000 PEOPLE SHOW UP IN GRAND RAPIDS. GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN. WE ENDED UP WINNING THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, FIRST TIME IN MANY DECADES. NOW WE ARE DOING WELL. WE'RE UP IN MICHIGAN. WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO CAR COMPANIES, NO PLANTS FOR 44 YEARS. THEY ARE BUILDING PLANTS ALL OVER THE STATE OF MICHIGAN BECAUSE OF ME. THEY ARE COMING IN FROM JAPAN. THEY ARE COMING IN FROM GERMANY. THEY ARE BUILDING PLANS ALL OVER AND EXPANDING PLANTS. I THINK MICHIGAN LIKES US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CONGRATULATIONS. DONE GREAT JOB. GET OUT THERE FOR THESE THREE CANDIDATES FOR SENATE. THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE. THREE UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE. WE APPRECIATE IT. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE BUILT THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WHICH IS TRUE. THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. NOW WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN. I SEE THESE ADS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I SAY MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AGAIN. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AGAIN. WE HAD IT DONE AND THEN THE PLAGUE CAME IN FROM CHINA. WE'RE TARIFFING THE HELL OUT OF THEM. OUR FARMERS WERE TALKING, WE GIVE IT TO THE FARMERS. IN MY FIRST THREE YEARS, FAMILY INCOME INCREASED BY $6,000. THINK OF THAT. $6,000 A FAMILY. MORE THAN FIVE TIMES THE GAINS IN ALL EIGHT YEARS UNDER THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. REMEMBER THIS, AND I SAID IT TODAY, IF THEY WERE GOOD, I WOULDN'T BE YOUR PRESIDENT. IF THEY WERE GOOD, I WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN RUN BUT THEY WERE HORRIBLE. IF THEY WERE GOOD, AND I DID RUN, I WOULDN'T HAVE WON BECAUSE I THEY WOULD HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB. THEY WERE HORRIBLE. THEY HAD FERGUSON. THEY HAD ALL THE PROBLEMS IN DIFFERENT PLACES. OAKLAND. BALTIMORE. THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS, IT WAS A DISASTER. THE TRADE DEALS WERE THE WORST AND THE IRAN DEAL WITH $150 BILLION, WE GOT NOTHING. $1.8 BILLION IN CASH. AFRICAN-AMERICAN INCOME GREW NINE TIMES MORE, NINE TIMES THAN IT DID UNDER BIDEN AND OBAMA. THEY CALLED UP, DAVID, TODAY. SIR, WE HAVE BAD NEWS. OBAMA IS GOING TO START CAMPAIGNING FOR SLEEPY JOE. I SAID IS THAT GOOD OR BAD? HE CAMPAIGNED HARDER FOR HILLARY THAN SHE DID. YOU KNOW? HE WAS VERY INEFFECTIVE AS A CAMPAIGNER. I THINK THAT IS GOOD NEWS. BUT IF YOU REMEMBER, HE WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR EIGHT YEARS AND OBAMA REFUSED TO ENDORSE HIM. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE IS MENTALLY SHOT. AND OBAMA, HE'S A PATRIOT. HE SAYS YOU CAN'T HAVE A GUY LIKE THIS. AND THEN HE ENDED UP LOOKING OUT BECAUSE WARREN WOULD NOT GET UP THE RACE SO THEY WERE SPLITTING UP THE VOTE. WHAT DID HE DO? IT TOOK HIM FOREVER TO MAKE THE ENDORSEMENT. FINALLY BECAUSE HE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. HE COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS GUY WON. BUT THEY SAID HE'S GOING TO BE CAMPAIGNING FOR HIM. JUST REMEMBER WHAT I SAID. HE NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT HE WON. EVEN AFTER HE WON, HE COULDN'T DO IT. TO BRING OPPORTUNITIES, SECURITY, FAIRNESS AND PROSPERITY THE BLACK COMMUNITIES, I HAVE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THE PLATINUM PLAN WHICH IS A BIG DEAL. WE WILL CREATE 3 MILLION NEW JOBS FOR BLACK AMERICANS, INCREASE ACCESS TO CAPITAL, RESTORE SAFETY TO EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE WILL DELIVER SCHOOL CHOICE, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. WE ARE DOING THAT. THAT'S ALL DONE. REMEMBER THIS, AND I SAY THIS AND SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S LIKE A LOT BUT IT'S TRUE. THEY DON'T CHALLENGE ME. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN, NOBODY HAS DONE MORE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAN DONALD TRUMP, AND IT'S TRUE. I GOT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, THAT WAS ME. THAT WAS NOT ANYBODY ELSE BUT ME. THEY CAME TO SEE ME. I GOT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM DONE, PRISON REFORM. OPPORTUNITY ZONES DONE WITH TIM SCOTT FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. GREAT SENATOR, GREAT MEN, GREAT PERSON. I GOT ALL OF THIS STUFF DONE, OPPORTUNITY ZONES. WE DID HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, EVERY YEAR, THEY WOULD COME UP, THE HEADS OF THESE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, REALLY GOOD PEOPLE. AFTER THE THIRD YEAR, I SAID HOW COME YOU KEEP COMING? BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A DEAL. WHAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE? ONE MAN SAID I FEEL LIKE A BEGGAR BECAUSE EVERY YEAR WE COME UP AND BEG FOR MONEY. I GOT THEM 10 YEAR ABSOLUTE FUNDING. HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES. OBAMA WOULDN'T DO IT. BIDEN WOULD NOT DO IT. NOBODY DID IT. I DID IT. JUST REMEMBER, CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING. BIDEN HAS VOWED TO BAN SCHOOL CHOICE AND CHARTERS SCHOOLS, DEVASTATING THE BLACK COMMUNITY. WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS REVERSING THE DAMAGE THAT JOE BIDEN INFLICTED OVER THE LAST 47 YEARS WITH HIS STUPIDITY. HE BACKED NAFTA, TPP WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER, AND CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO OUR COUNTRY. FOR DECADES, OUR POLITICIANS SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS REBUILDING FOREIGN NATIONS, FIGHTING FOREIGN WARS, COUNTRIES YOU'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. AND DEFENDING FOREIGN BORDERS BUT WE DIDN'T DEFEND OUR OWN BORDERS. NOW WE ARE FINALLY PROTECTING OUR NATION, REBUILDING OUR CITIES AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR JOBS, OUR FACTORIES AND OUR TROOPS BACK HOME TO THE USA. ABOUT TIME. ABOUT TIME. THEY ARE ALL COMING HOME. THEY ARE ALL COMING HOME. WE INVESTED $2.5 TRILLION IN THE U.S. MILITARY AND LODGED THE FIRST NEW BRANCH OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES IN 75 YEARS. SO NECESSARY, THE SPACE FORCE. AND FOR OUR GREAT VETERANS, WE PASSED V.A. CHOICE AND V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY. YOU HEARD TWO WEEKS AGO, WE GOT A 91% APPROVAL RATING FROM OUR VETS. FIRST TIME IT'S EVER HAPPENED. WE TOOK OVER 100% OF THE ISIS CALIPHATE IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. WHEN I TOOK OVER, IT WAS A MESS. WE KILLED THE LEADER OF ISIS WHO WAS TRYING TO REFORM ISIS, AL-BAGHDADI IS DEAD. WE TOOK OUT THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST AND THE MASS MURDERER OF AMERICAN TROOPS AND TROOPS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND MANY PEOPLE, SALOMEOLEMANI IS DEAD. I WITHDREW FROM THE LAST ADMINISTRATION'S DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. SPEENT $150 BILLION TO IRAN WHICH THEY USED FOR TERROR. $1.8 BILLION IN CASH, I TERMINATED. MY FIRST PHONE CALL IF I WIN WILL BE FROM THE HEAD OF IRAN SAYING LET'S MAKE A DEAL. THEIR ECONOMY IS IN TATTERS RIGHT NOW. THEY WENT DOWN 27% GDP. I HAVE EVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING. WE DON'T WANT THAT. WE WANT THEM TO DO FINE BUT THEY CAN NEVER HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I RECOGNIZE THE TRUE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. IT'S ALL BUILT. IT'S ALL BUILT. IT'S ALL BUILT. NOT ONLY DID WE GET IT APPROVED, I GOT THE BUILDING BUILT. I SAID FIND A BUILDING ON A SITE THAT WE OWN. THEY WERE GOING TO SPEND $2 BILLION TO BUILD AN EMBASSY. I SAID THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT. I TOLD OUR GREAT AMBASSADOR, WE HAVE ANY LAND IN JERUSALEM? YEAH, WE HAVE A GREAT SITE. TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND CALL ME. THERE'S A BUILDING WE CAN RENOVATE. WE WILL SPEND ANYWHERE FROM $1 BILLION TO $2 BILLION. I SAID LET'S DO SOMETHING. HE CALLED ME BACK AND SAID WE CAN RENOVATE THE BUILDING FOR $350,000 WE HAVE. FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, IN MY BUSINESS CAREER I EVER DID THIS. I SAID IT IS TOO CHEAP, DOES NOT SOUND GOOD. NORMALLY I WOULD SAY, LET'S MAKE IT 250. I SAID USE LIKE $500,000 AND USE JERUSALEM STONE. I'VE GOT A GUY, HE'S GOT JERUSALEM STONE IN THE LOBBY OF HIS OFFICE BUILDING. HE SAID WE ARE IN JERUSALEM. THE WHOLE PLACE IS JERUSALEM STONE AND IT WAS CHEAP AS HELL. WE BUILT THIS BUILDING FOR UNDER $500,000 AND IT'S BEEN OPEN FOR A LONG TIME. AND EVERY PRESIDENT FOR MANY DECADES SAID THEY WOULD DO IT AND NOT ONE OF THEM GOT IT DONE. AND I GOT IT DONE AND GOT THE BUILDING BUILT. I ALSO RECOGNIZE ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOAL LINE HEIGHTS. 52 YEARS THEY WERE WORKING ON IT. I GOT IT DONE IN ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HOURS. INSTEAD OF ENDLESS WAR, WE ARE FORGING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITHOUT BLOOD ALL OVER THE SAND. YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. UAE, BAHRAIN. WE HAVE COUNTRIES LINED UP TO SIGN. THE FACT IS I DID MORE IN 47 MONTHS THEN SLEEPY JOE BIDEN DID IN 47 YEARS. NOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING THE MOST FAR LEFT EVER PUT FORWARD BY A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE. THE BIDEN PLAN WOULD DESTROY SOCIAL SECURITY AND DESTROY PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO GET IT. THIS GREEN NEW DEAL WILL DESTROY OUR COUNTRY. IT'S CRAZY. WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT, I THOUGHT THEY WERE JOKING ACTUALLY. I THOUGHT, OH, NOT EVEN COWS DO THEY WANT. I THINK I GAVE UP ON THAT. THEY WON'T EVER GIVE UP. BIDEN'S RUNNING MATE SPONSORED A BILL TO OUTSOURCE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE. 180 MILLION PEOPLE THAT LOVE THEIR PRIVATE PLANS. THOSE PLANS ARE GOING TO BE GONE. BIDEN VOWED TO TERMINATE OUR TRAVEL BANS ON JIHADIST REGIONS AND SERVE REFUGEE ADMISSIONS 700%, OPENING THE FLOODGATES TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. YOUR STATE IN YOUR COUNTRY WILL BE OVERRUN AND OVERWHELMED. WE WILL HAVE NO MONEY AND WE WILL INDEED BE ANOTHER VENEZUELA, VERY LARGE-SCALE VERSION. A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A VOTE FOR SAFE COMMUNITIES, GREAT JOBS, AND A LIMITLESS FUTURE FOR ALL AMERICANS. IT'S A VOTE FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM. THE AMERICAN DREAM AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIGGER AND BETTER THAN WE'VE EVER HAD IT BEFORE. IN CONCLUSION, OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA INTO THE MANUFACTURING SUPERPOWER OF THE WORLD, AND WE WILL END OUR RELIANCE ON CHINA ONCE AND FOR ALL. IT'S ALREADY TAKING PLACE. WE WILL HIRE MORE POLICE, INCREASE PENALTIES FOR ASSAULTS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND WE WILL BAN DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES. WE WILL UPHOLD RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, FREE SPEECH, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. SECOND AMENDMENT. WE WILL STRIKE DOWN TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN OUR CITIZENS AND WE WILL KEEP AMERICA OUT OF THESE ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS, ENDLESS FOREIGN WARS. OUR TROOPS ARE COMING HOME. WE WILL MAINTAIN AMERICA'S UNRIVALED MILITARY MIGHT AND WE WILL ENSURE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, WE HAVE THE GREATEST WEAPONS, MUCH OF IT BUILT EVER IN THE HISTORY OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. WE ARE THE ENVY OF CHINA AND RUSSIA AND NORTH KOREA AND EVERYBODY. WHEN I CAME HERE, ONE OF OUR MOST OVERRATED GENERALS IN THE WORLD TOLD ME, ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED GENERALS, HE SAID WE HAVE NO AMMUNITION. I SAID NO PRESIDENT SHOULD EVER HEAR THAT. NOW WE HAVE AMMUNITION LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. WE HAVE ROCKETS AND WE HAVE MISSILES AND WE HAVE TANKS AND WE HAVE F-35'S AND ALL SORTS OF AIRCRAFT, TANKERS AND BOMBERS. ONLY HOPE TO GOD WE NEVER HAVE TO USE IT. $2.5 TRILLION. WE WILL AND SURPRISE MEDICAL BUILDING. REQUIRE PRICE TRANSFERS AND FURTHER REDUCE THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THEY WILL BE COMING DOWN 80%, 90%, 70%. WE WILL STRONGLY PROTECT MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY. WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AMERICA WILL ADD THE FIRST WOMAN ON THE MOON. AND WE WILL BE THE FIRST TO LAND IN ASTOR NET ON MARS. WE WILL STOP THE RADICAL INDOCTRINATION OF OUR STUDENTS AND RESTORE PATRIOTIC EDUCATION OUR SCHOOLS. WE WILL TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. WE WILL LIVE BY THE TIMELESS WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, IN GOD WE TRUST. FOR YEARS YOU HAD A PRESIDENT WHO APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICAN NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. IN STANDING UP FOR THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA. I LOVE GEORGIA. EARLY VOTING IS UNDERWAY. GET YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND NEIGHBORS AND COWORKERS. GET OUT AND VOTE EARLY. A GIANT RED WAVE IS COMING. FROM ATLANTA TO AUGUSTINE OR, FROM SAVANNAH TO COLUMBUS, AND FROM MARIETTA TO RIGHT HERE IN MACON, GEORGIA. MACON, GEORGIA. WE INHERIT THE LEGACY OF GEORGIA PATRIOTS WHO GAVE THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS FOR THIS BELOVED NATION. WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF AMERICAN HEROES WHO CROSSED THE OCEAN TO BLAZE A TRAIL. SETTLED THE CONTINENT, TAMES THE WILDERNESS, DUG OUT THE PANAMA CANAL. LAY DOWN THE RAILROADS, RAISED UP THE GIANT SKYSCRAPERS, WON TWO WORLD WARS AND DEFEATED FASCISM AND COMMUNISM. MADE AMERICA THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WE ARE MAKING A GREATER EVERY SINGLE DAY. PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY. TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WITH YOUR HELP AND DEVOTION AND DRIVE, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING. KEEP ON FIGHTING. WE WILL KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. WE ARE ONE MOVEMENT, ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY, AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD. TOGETHER WITH THE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, WE HAVE MADE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. WE HAD MADE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN. WE HAVE MADE AMERICA PROUD AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU.",

         "BEAUTIFUL. WOULD A CROWD THIS ONE IS. YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE. THEY ARE TAKING BUSES TO GET OVER HERE. WELL, I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO I WANT TO START BY SAYING, HELLO, NEVADA. HOW ARE YOU DOING? HOW ARE YOU? AND I'M THRILLED TO BE IN DOUGLAS COUNTY, BUT PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR DOUGLAS COUNTY, ISN'T IT? WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF LOYAL, HARDWORKING AMERICAN PATRIOTS, THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE. AND 52 DAYS FROM NOW, WE'RE GOING TO WIN NEVADA, AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THEN AFTER THAT WE'LL NEGOTIATE, RIGHT? 'CAUSE WE'RE PROBABLY, BASED ON THE WAY WE WERE TREATED, WE'RE PROBABLY ENTITLED TO ANOTHER FOUR AFTER THAT. AND IT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO ANOTHER PRESIDENT. THAT'S JUST A DISHONEST GROUP OF PEOPLE. BUT HERE WE ARE, AND WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. THE GOVERNOR OF YOUR STATE- TRIED VERY HARD TO STOP US FROM HAVING THIS EVENT TONIGHT. HE DIDN'T LIKE US HAVING THEY CAN HAVE RIOTS AND THEY CAN HAVE ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND THAT'S OKAY, YOU CAN BURN UP THE HOUSE, THAT'S OKAY. WE CALL THIS A PROTEST BECAUSE IF YOU CALL IT A PROTEST, YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE IT. IT'S OKAY. SO IF ANYBODY ASKS YOU OUTSIDE, THIS IS CALLED A FRIENDLY PROTEST, OKAY? IT'S TRUE. YOU CAN'T HAVE POLITICAL RALLIES. THAT'S BECAUSE OF ME, BECAUSE IF BIDEN WERE HERE, HE'D HAVE ABOUT THREE PEOPLE. DO YOU EVER SEE HIM WITH HIS LITTLE CIRCLES? THE CIRCLE? YOU KNOW WHY HE PUTS THE CIRCLES? BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE LIKE CORRECT WITH COVID, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET ANYBODY TO FILL UP A ROOM. SO THEY PUT THESE BIG CIRCLES. SO HE CAN'T GET ANYBODY TO FILL. NOBODY WANTS TO GO. OH, BOY, THE FAKE NEWS, LOOK AT ALL THOSE PEOPLE BACK THERE, THE FAKERS. THAT'S TRUE. BOY, THEY COVERED. DID YOU SEE THE OTHER DAY, NOW THEY'RE FINDING OUT THAT TO DO AN INTERVIEW, AN INTERVIEW, THEY ASK HIM A QUESTION. THAT MEANS THEY'RE GIVING HIM THE QUESTIONS, THEY NEVER GAVE ME QUESTIONS BEFORE. SO TO DO AN INTERVIEW, HE DEMANDS ON GETTING THE QUESTIONS, AND HIS PEOPLE WRITE OUT THE ANSWER. SO THEY ASK HIM A QUESTION. HE GOES, 'BRING IT UP CLOSER, I CAN'T SEE IT, DAMMIT.' GREAT. THIS IS SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A DEBATE COMING UP IN THREE WEEKS. AND HERE'S THE PROBLEM. WINSTON CHURCHILL. DID YOU EVER HEAR OF WINSTON CHURCHILL? WINSTON CHURCHILL WAS A GREAT DEBATER. GREAT. AND IF JOE GETS OFF THE STAGE, WALKS OFF THE STAGE, IF HE MAKES IT, WHICH I THINK HE PROBABLY WILL, IN ALL FAIRNESS, HE'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR 47 YEARS, RIGHT? I THINK HE PROBABLY WILL. IF HE GETS OFF THE STAGE, THEY'RE GOING TO SAY IT WAS THE SINGLE GREATEST DEBATE THEY'VE EVER SEEN. WINSTON CHURCHILL WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO SLEEPY JOE. YOU KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW THAT, THEY'RE GOING TO SAY, 'WHAT A GREAT PERFORMANCE. HE WAS GREAT TODAY. HE WAS GREAT. THIS GUY WAS GREAT.' NAH, HE'S NOT GREAT. BUT YOUR GOVERNOR TRIED TO STOP US. HE TRIED TO STOP US. THE GOVERNOR OF NEVADA, HE TRIED TO STOP US, AND WE WENT TO DIFFERENT VENUES. KELLY O'DONNELL, SHE'S A FADING REPORTER FOR NBC. DO YOU KNOW THAT? SHE WAS ON, SHE SAID, 'WELL, THEY HAVE A CROWD TONIGHT.' BEHIND HER, IT LOOKED LIKE 25,000 PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE, BY THE WAY, A LOT MORE COMING IN. BUT SHE SAID, 'HE'S GOT MAYBE A THOUSAND PEOPLE, A THOUSAND.' YOU KNOW WHAT I GOT? I HAVE A THOUSAND PEOPLE HERE. NO, THIS IS THE FAKE NEWS. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF HOW MANY YOU KNOW WHAT I GOT? I HAVE A THOUSAND PEOPLE HERE. NO, THIS IS THE FAKE NEWS. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF HOW MANY THEY ARE JUST A BUNCH OF DISHONEST PEOPLE, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. BEING IN REAL ESTATE AND BEING IN NEW YORK AND BEING IN ALL OVER, I'VE SEEN A LOT OF DISHONEST PEOPLE. I THINK THE MEDIA, THE FAKE NEWS IS THE MOST DISHONEST GROUP OF PEOPLE I'VE EVER SEEN ANYWHERE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. AND THAT INCLUDES, BY THE WAY, LEADERS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT AREN'T OUR FRIENDS, OKAY? THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT. THEY REALLY ARE BAD NEWS. BUT HERE WE ARE, AND THIS IS REALLY AMAZING. THE GOVERNOR TRIED TO STOP US, HE COULDN'T, BUT THINK OF THIS, HE'S IN CONTROL OF MILLIONS OF VOTES. HERE'S A GUY CALLING VENUES, TELLING THEM NOT TO HAVE THE RALLY, CALLING DIFFERENT VENUES, 'DON'T HAVE THE RALLY. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET YOU HAVE THE RALLY.' AND HE'S CALLING, THIS GOVERNOR WHO WAS A POLITICAL HACK, HE WAS A POLITICAL HACK, AND THEN HE BECAME GOVERNOR. AND THIS IS THE GUY THAT WE'RE ENTRUSTING WITH MILLIONS OF BALLOTS, UNSOLICITED BALLOTS, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS. AND THEN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WIN THESE STATES, AND WE HAVE A GUY THAT WOULD DO THAT WHERE HE WON'T LET US HAVE, AND WE CALL IT A PROTEST AND THEREFORE WE CAN DO IT. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING? IT'S A DISGRACE. SO WHO THE HELL IS GOING TO TRUST? THEY SAY, 'TRUST GOVERNMENT.' WELL, HOW WOULD YOU TRUST A GUY THAT FOUGHT THAT WE AREN'T HERE, THAT WE CAN'T HAVE ALL THESE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE? BOY, YOU ARE REALLY BACK FAR. THAT'S LOOK AT THAT. NO, BUT SERIOUSLY. AND NOW HE'S IN CHARGE OF THE ELECTION AND THE MILLIONS OF BALLOTS. SO IF I'M UP LIKE MILLIONS OF VOTES, HE CAN RIG THE ELECTION, HE CAN RIG THE ELECTION. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WHETHER IT'S IN NORTH CAROLINA, WHETHER IT'S IN MICHIGAN, WHETHER IT'S IN OTHER STATES WHERE THEY'RE SENDING OUT, THEY'RE GOING TO BE SENDING OUT 80 MILLION BALLOTS. AND IT'S DEMOCRATS. THEY'RE TRYING TO RIG THIS ELECTION, AT EVERY SINGLE PLACE IN THE LAST YEAR, YEAR AND A HALF, GO MODERN DAY, FORGET ABOUT TINY AMOUNTS, A CONGRESSIONAL RACE IN NEW YORK, A SMALL NUMBER OF VOTES. IF YOU GO TO NEW JERSEY, IF YOU GO TO VIRGINIA, IF YOU GO TO PENNSYLVANIA, IF YOU GO TO CALIFORNIA, LOOK AT SOME OF THESE RACES, EVERY ONE OF THESE RACES WAS A FRAUD, MISSING BALLOTS. AND I DON'T MEAN LIKE 1%. I MEAN LIKE 20%, 25%, THEY'RE TRYING TO RIG THE ELECTION. THEY SHOULD MAKE PEOPLE, IF YOU REGISTER, IF YOU WANT A SOLICITED BALLOT, THAT'S WHERE YOU ASK FOR IT. YOU HAVE TO SIGN PAPERS. YOU GET IT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BE THERE. THAT'S ONE THING. WHEN THEY SEND 80 MILLION BALLOTS TO PEOPLE, THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY'RE GOING. ACTUALLY, THEY PROBABLY DO HAVE A GOOD IDEA WHERE THEY'RE GOING, AND THAT'S OUR PROBLEM. THEY SEND 80 MILLION BALLOTS OUT. WHERE ARE THEY GOING? WHO ARE THEY SENDING THEM TO? ARE THEY SENDING THEM TO CERTAIN AREAS AND NOT OTHER AREAS? ARE THEY SENDING THEM TO DEMOCRAT AREAS? THESE ARE ALL CONTROLLED BY DEMOCRAT GOVERNORS, LIKE YOUR POLITICALLY MOTIVATED GOVERNOR. SO, JUST TO FINISH ON THAT, LOOK, JUST TO FINISH ON THAT, HE'S A GUY THAT TRIED TO SILENCE US BY NOT HAVING THIS. AND IT ENDED UP, OUR CROWD TURNED OUT TO BE A LOT BIGGER THAN NBC, WHICH IS OWNED BY CONCAST. C-O-N, CONCAST. C-O-N-C-A-S-T, CONCAST. IT'S REALLY COMCAST, BUT I CALL IT CON BECAUSE IT'S A WHOLE CON. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IN THE OLD DAYS, I THINK IT SHOULD STILL BE, NEWS WHEN THEY BROADCAST HAD TO BE REASONABLY ACCURATE, RIGHT? AND THEY HAD LICENSING. TODAY, THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL THEY WANT. IT'S FAKE NEWS, AND IT'S A DISGRACE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, BACK THERE, AND I'LL TELL YOU, IT'S HURTING OUR COUNTRY. IT'S HURTING OUR COUNTRY. THEY'RE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS IS THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA, WORSE THAN THE DEMOCRATS, BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS ARE THEIR PARTNERS. THEY PLAY TOGETHER. JOE BIDEN SPENT THE LAST 47 YEARS SELLING OUT AMERICA, OFFSHORING YOUR JOBS, THROWING OPEN YOUR BORDERS, DEPLETING OUR MILITARY AND SACRIFICING YOUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE IN CHINA. I'VE SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS BRINGING OUR JOBS BACK TO AMERICA, SECURING OUR BORDERS, REBUILDING OUR MILITARY AND STANDING UP TO CHINA LIKE NEVER BEFORE. NOBODY HAS EVER STOOD UP TO CHINA LIKE WE HAVE STOOD UP TO CHINA, AND YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST OF IT. SLEEPY JOE BIDEN, WHO SURRENDERED, YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS NOW, HE'S IN HIS DAMN BASEMENT AGAIN. NO, HE'S IN HIS BASEMENT. HE'S IN HIS BASEMENT. BUT I CAN BE BAD TO HIM BECAUSE HE PUT THE MOST VICIOUS AD ON TELEVISION THAT I'VE EVER SEEN. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? WHERE I'M STANDING OVER THE GRAVES OF OUR FALLEN WARRIORS, OUR FALLEN HEROES. THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE, THE GREATEST PEOPLE THERE ARE, AND I'M STANDING OVER THERE AND THEY HAVE SOME SLEAZEBAG REPORTER FROM A THIRD RATE MAGAZINE HAVING SOME SOURCE QUOTING ME SAYING, I WON'T EVEN USE THE TERM, BUT SAYING BAD THINGS. AND THERE'S NOBODY THAT LOVES OUR MILITARY, RESPECTS IT AND THE PEOPLE MORE THAN ME. AND THEY TOOK AND I DIDN'T EVEN ASK. WE HAD 25 PEOPLE THAT WERE WITNESSES THAT ARE ON THE RECORD ALREADY THAT HAVE SAID THAT NEVER TOOK PLACE. IT NEVER TOOK PLACE, WHAT THEY SAID. AND YET PATHETIC JOE, AND HE'S A PATHETIC HUMAN BEING TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. HERE'S THE PROBLEM, HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, I DON'T THINK. I THINK HE HAS NO IDEA, BUT HE'S A PATHETIC HUMAN BEING TO LET THAT HAPPEN, WHERE THEY PUT AN AD LIKE THAT, WHERE I'M STANDING OVER GRAVES. AND THEN THEY SAID, 'HE SAID THIS,' WITH NO SOURCES, NO NOTHING. THEY GOT NOTHING. AND I HAVE 25 REAL WITNESSES WITH THE NAMES, WITH EVERYTHING, SAYING IT NEVER HAPPENED. AND THEY PUT AN AD LIKE THAT UP, THEY'RE A DISGRACE. BUT YOU KNOW THE GOOD PART? NOW I CAN BE REALLY VICIOUS. I CAN BE REALLY VICIOUS. AND WE'LL START BY SAYING, WE'RE GOING TO START BY SAYING THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO RIG THIS ELECTION BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE GOING TO WIN. THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE GOING TO WIN IS TO RIG IT. BIDEN'S SURRENDERED YOUR JOBS TO CHINA. LOOK, HIS SON WALKED AWAY WITH A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS, GIVE ME A BREAK, GIVE ME A HIS SON'S GOING TO SAY, 'DAD, YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS MONEY AWAY. DON'T DO IT, DAD, PLEASE, I DON'T ' YOU KNOW HOW MUCH EXPERIENCE HE HAD? THERE'S A YOUNG MAN HERE, HE'S A VERY YOUNG, YOUNG MAN, HANDSOME YOUNG GUY. HE'S ABOUT LIKE 12. YOU KNOW WHAT? HE'S GOT MORE EXPERIENCE THAN HUNTER. HUNTER. WHERE'S HUNTER? WHERE IS HE? WITH NO EXPERIENCE, NO KNOWLEDGE OF ENERGY, NO JOB, GOT THROWN OUT OF THE MILITARY YOU KNOW HE GOT THROWN OUT, BY THE WAY. I USED TO BE NICE ABOUT THAT. NOW I DON'T. ONCE I SAW THAT AD, I DON'T HAVE TO BE NICE ANYMORE. OKAY, I REALLY MEAN IT. AND BY THE WAY, ON THAT AD, I KNOW SOME HORRIBLE PEOPLE, HORRIBLE HUMAN BEINGS, SOME OF THE WORST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, I REALLY DO, THEY'RE HORRIBLE, NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE, AND THEY'RE THE WORST, THE WORST, REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS IN NEW YORK, YOU DON'T GET MUCH WORSE. I KNOW SOME OF THE WORST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, NOT ONE PERSON DO I KNOW THAT WOULD SAY THAT, STANDING ON TOP OF GRAVES, OF HEROES, REALLY, NOT ONE PERSON. SO I WILL TELL YOU THIS, SO NOW WE CAN PLAY IT LIKE IT IS. LET'S FACE IT, JOE IS SHOT. LET'S FACE IT, OKAY? HE'S SHOT. SO NOT THAT HE HAS ANYTHING TO DO BECAUSE HE WON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. HE'LL JUST BE LOCKED UP IN A ROOM SOMEPLACE, AND THE RADICAL LEFT IS GOING TO BE RUNNING OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU. BUT NOW HE WANTS TO SURRENDER OUR COUNTRY TO THE VIOLENT LEFT WING MOB. YOU KNOW THAT. IF BIDEN WINS, CHINA WINS. IF BIDEN WINS, THE MOB WINS. YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ALL THESE DEMOCRATIC OR I ALWAYS SAY DEMOCRAT-RUN CITIES AND STATES. IT'S A DISASTER. IT'S A DISASTER. AND WE KEEP SAYING, 'LET US BRING IN THE TROOPS.' WELL, WE DID IT IN MINNEAPOLIS, WE ENDED IT. IN 45 MINUTES, IT WAS ENDED. THEY WENT THROUGH TWO WEEKS. BY THE WAY, WE COULD DO IT IN PORTLAND IN HALF AN HOUR. IT WOULD ALL BE OVER. BUT WE HAVE THESE STUPID PEOPLE THAT THINK HOW ABOUT THAT POOR MAYOR? IS THAT PATHETIC, WHEELER, IS THAT PATHETIC? THEY FORCED HIM OUT OF HIS HOME. HE'S NOW FINDING A NEW HOME, IT'S SO NICE. IT'S PATHETIC. HONESTLY, IT'S PATHETIC. WE COULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IN A HALF AN HOUR, JUST LIKE WE DID. AND BY THE WAY, THE U.S. MARSHALS DID A GREAT JOB IN PORTLAND. THEY DID A GREAT JOB. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. IF BIDEN WINS, THE RIOTERS WIN, THE ANARCHISTS WIN, ARSONISTS, FLAG BURNERS, THEY ALL WIN. I'M RUNNING FOR REELECTION TO BRING PROSPERITY TO NEVADA, TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY. I'VE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME. I HAVE SOME THINGS IN NEVADA THAT ARE VERY GOOD TO PUT VIOLENT CRIMINALS BEHIND BARS AND TO ENSURE THE FUTURE BELONGS TO AMERICA, NOT TO CHINA. I DO GET A KICK OUT OF WATCHING A GUY, 'OH, I'M GOING TO DO THIS.' HE COPIED MY WHOLE PLAN. YOU SEE, HE SAYS, 'BUY AMERICA,' I SAID, 'WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN FOR THE LAST HALF CENTURY?' COULD I ASK THE FAKE NEWS TO TAKE YOUR CAMERAS AND SHOW ALL THE WAY BACK THERE FOR HUNDREDS OF YARDS, ALL THE WAY BACK THERE. TAKE YOUR CAMERAS. GO AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE. NO, NO, TELL NBC NEWS IT'S NOT A THOUSAND PEOPLE. YOU CAN'T SEE IT. YOU CAN'T SEE IT DOWN HERE. YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW MANY PEOPLE. THAT THING GOES BACK SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN WE WIN, AMERICA WINS, THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND NOBODY'S DONE TO CHINA WHAT I DID. LOOK, BILLIONS, TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TARIFFS WE TOOK IN. I GAVE $28 BILLION TO FARMERS. THE FARMERS ARE DOING VERY WELL. THEY'RE DOING VERY WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP. $28 BILLION. $16 MILLION ONE YEAR, $12 MILLION THEY WERE TARGETED. I SAID, 'HOW MUCH IS IT?' SONNY PERDUE, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE, GREAT GUY, SAID, 'HOW MUCH WERE THEY HURT BY?' ' SIR, $12 BILLION TWO YEARS AGO AND $60 BILLION LAST YEAR $16 BILLION LAST YEAR.' I SAID, 'ALL RIGHT, GOOD. WE WILL TAKE IT OUT OF CHINA.' WE GAVE THEM $28 BILLION, TO THE FARMERS. THAT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. YOU THINK JOE BIDEN WOULD EVEN THINK ABOUT IT? HE WOULDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. HE WOULDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. NO, HE'S MORE WORRIED ABOUT, DOES HE HAVE A TELEPROMPTER TO ANSWER A REPORTER'S QUESTION. THE WORST PART ABOUT THAT ISN'T THE FACT THAT HE'S DOING THAT, BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, HE'S UNABLE, OKAY? IT'S NOT THAT, IT'S THAT THE FAKE NEWS WOULD GIVE HIM THE QUESTIONS. THEY NEVER GAVE ME THE QUESTIONS. DID YOU EVER GIVE ME QUESTIONS, BACK THERE? DID YOU EVER GIVE ME THEY DON'T GIVE ME QUESTIONS. THE FAKE NEWS WOULD GIVE HIM QUESTIONS, BUT OF COURSE NOW DONNA BRAZILE WORKS FOR FOX, SO THAT'S GONE A LONG WAY. REMEMBER? REMEMBER WHEN DONNA BRAZILE GAVE CROOKED HILLARY THE QUESTIONS, RIGHT? TO A DEBATE? AND THEN SHE SAID, 'WELL, I DON'T THINK I DID IT. I DON'T REMEMBER.' I KNEW SHE WAS IN TROUBLE WHEN SHE SAID, 'I DON'T REMEMBER DOING THAT. I DON'T REMEMBER.' SHE DIDN'T REMEMBER. OH, OKAY. WELL, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T REMEMBER. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE TOO. IT'S TRUE. YOU KNOW WHAT, I USED TO STAND BACK AND I'D SAY, 'BE QUIET, PLEASE. DON'T SAY THAT. IT'S REALLY NOT NICE.' YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE. SHE DELETED 33 THINK OF IT. THEY'LL NEVER FIND THE EMAILS BECAUSE THEY WERE ACID WASHED, DELETED. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE GOT A SUBPOENA FROM THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, RIGHT? AND SHE AND HER LAWYER DELETED 33,000 EMAILS AFTER SHE GOT A UNITED STATES SUBPOENA. AND YOU SAY, 'WHY ISN'T SHE GUILTY OF A MAJOR CRIME?' RIGHT? AND THEN SHE TOOK HER TELEPHONES AND SHE SMASHED THEM WITH A HAMMER. RIGHT? AND THEN SHE TOOK THE OTHER ONES, AND SHE DELETED THEM. AND NOW THE MUELLER SCAM, THESE PEOPLE, THE WORST PEOPLE. I HAVE A FRIEND, A VERY SMART GUY, VERY STREETWISE GUY. HE SAID, 'YOU HAVE TO BE THE MOST HONEST GUY IN THE WORLD TO GO THROUGH THREE YEARS OF INVESTIGATIONS, WHERE THEY HAVE THE WORST HUMAN BEINGS IN THE WORLD.' THEY WORKED FOR THE DEMOCRATS. I MEAN, MUELLER DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE. BUT LOOK AT THIS WEISSMANN, HOW BAD WAS WEISSMANN? HE DELETED HIS PHONE. THAT'S ILLEGAL. HE DELETED EVERYTHING. THEY ALL DELETED. AND THEY ALL SAID, 'OH GEE, WE MADE A MISTAKE. WE ARE SORRY.' THEY ALL USED THE SAME MISTAKE. IT WAS, 'OH GEE, WE DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT.' EVERY ONE OF THEM, ALL OF THEM. I THINK IT WAS 31 DIFFERENT PHONES, THEY DELETED. THESE ARE CRIMINALS WE'RE DEALING WITH. AND THEY'VE GOT TO THERE HAS TO BE A REPERCUSSION. THERE HAS TO BE A REPERCUSSION. WE'RE DEALING WITH CRIMINALS. SO I DON'T CARE IF YOU SAY IT ANYMORE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE ILLEGALLY DELETED, AND HER LAWYERS SHOULD GO TO JAIL WITH HER, OKAY? AND THE FACT IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DOESN'T PLAY IT ROUGH AND TOUGH LIKE THOSE PEOPLE, THEY DON'T PLAY IT THE SAME WAY. THEY'RE TOO NICE. AND WE HAVE BETTER POLICY. THANK GOODNESS WE HAVE BETTER WE BELIEVE IN BORDERS. WE BELIEVE IN NO SANCTUARY CITIES. WE BELIEVE IN LOWERING TAXES. WE HAVE BETTER, BUT OUR PEOPLE DON'T WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE VERY GOOD. JIM JORDAN, GOOD, RIGHT? MARK MEADOWS, GOOD, RIGHT? NO, WE HAVE SOME VERY GOOD, BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WE PLAY IT SO NICE, AND IN THE END IT'S NOT RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT THEY GET AWAY WITH AND OBAMA AND BIDEN GOT CAUGHT SPYING ON OUR CAMPAIGN USING THE INTELLIGENCE, I PUT THAT IN QUOTES, USING INTELLIGENCE TO SPY ON OUR CAMPAIGN, AND THEY GOT CAUGHT. THEY GOT CAUGHT. AND IF IT WAS ME THAT GOT CAUGHT, FORGET ABOUT IT. BUT THEY GOT CAUGHT AND SOMEBODY SAID, ' WELL I KNOW, BUT HE WAS PRESIDENT.' OH GREAT, I'M PRESIDENT TOO. AND A HELL OF A LOT BETTER PRESIDENT THAN HE IS, I CAN TELL YOU THAT. OBAMA CAME INTO OFFICE, THEY GAVE HIM THE NOBEL PRIZE, LIKE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, RIGHT? IN FACT, HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHY HE GOT IT. HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW, HE HAD NO IDEA WHY HE GOT IT. AND HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE DOES EITHER. THEY STILL DON'T KNOW, BUT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS. SO WE WERE NOMINATED A FEW DAYS AGO FOR A NOBEL PRIZE, WHICH IS A BIG THING. NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. AND THEN YESTERDAY WE WERE NOMINATED A SECOND TIME FOR ANOTHER NOBEL PRIZE. NOW, THAT'S A BIG THING. TO ME, IT'S A BIG THING, EVEN THOUGH OBVIOUSLY IT'S A VERY POLITICAL THING, BUT IT'S A VERY BIG THING. THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE, RIGHT? I GOT, IT WAS JUST REPORTED. I'M JUST REPORTING THIS, I GOT ZERO TIME ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS, ON THE NETWORK NEWS. ZERO, ZERO. WE GOT ZERO TIME. THINK OF IT, THE PRESIDENT OF YOUR COUNTRY IS HONORED BY BEING NOMINATED FOR THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE, AND YOUR NIGHTLY NEWS, ABC, WHICH IS TERRIBLE, CBS, WHICH IS TERRIBLE, AND PROBABLY THE WORST OF ALL OWNED BY CONCAST, THEY SPEND A FORTUNE ON PR, AND THEN EVERY TIME I GET UP, I CALL THEM CONCAST AND SORT OF WIPE OUT THEIR FORTUNE. BUT THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE. BUT NBC IS THE WORST OF THEM ALL, NOT ONE MENTIONED. THESE PEOPLE ARE CORRUPT. NOT ONE MENTIONED, NOT ONE MENTIONED. SO YOUR PRESIDENT GETS A NOBEL AND, AT LEAST A NOMINATION, AND THEY DON'T MENTION IT. JOE BIDEN CANNOT LEAD OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE HE DOESN'T REALLY BELIEVE IN OUR COUNTRY. RIGHT NOW, I DON'T THINK HE BELIEVES IN ANYTHING, HE JUST WANTS TO GO TO SLEEP. THAT'S ALL. 'PLEASE, DARLING, I WANT TO GO TO BED. I'M EXHAUSTED. I MADE ONE SPEECH YESTERDAY.' 'BUT DARLING, THEY GAVE YOU THE ANSWERS AND THE QUESTIONS.' 'I KNOW, BUT THAT WAS A BIG STRAIN BECAUSE MY EYES, I COULDN'T SEE THE TELEPROMPTER.' THIS GUY IS THE WORST. AND YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO MAYBE COME BACK TO HAUNT ME BECAUSE WE HAVE A RIGGED ELECTION. IT'S A RIGGED ELECTION. IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO LOSE, BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, HE IS THE WORST CANDIDATE IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS. HE DOESN'T KNOW HE'S ALIVE. HE DOESN'T KNOW HE'S ALIVE. AND I GOT TO KNOW PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA VERY WELL, PRESIDENT PUTIN OF RUSSIA, KIM JONG-UN. BY THE WAY, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WAR? I THOUGHT WE WAS GOING TO WAR WITH KIM JONG-UN. WHERE'S THE WAR? WHERE'S THE WAR? OH, I SEE. OH, I SEE. IT NEVER HAPPENED, DID IT? NEVER HAPPENED, DID IT? WELL, MAYBE SOME DAY, COULD HAPPEN. NO, REMEMBER? 'TRUMP IS GOING TO BE ' YOU KNOW MY PERSONALITY, RIGHT? 'TRUMP IS GOING TO BE A WAR AT WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK AFTER HE WINS.' WHERE'S THE WAR? IN FACT, THE PEACE PRIZE WAS BECAUSE I STAYED OUT OF WARS, AND BY THE WAY, ENDED CERTAIN WARS THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT. AND LOOK WHAT WE DID JUST YESTERDAY IN EUROPE, AND LOOK WHAT WE DID WITH ISRAEL, AND YOU JUST SAW THAT, WITH UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, AND BAHRAIN. FOR 72 YEARS, NOTHING HAPPENED, AND WE DID IT. WE DO IT VERY FAST. AND PLENTY OF OTHER COUNTRIES ARE GOING TO BE COMING IN. AT BIDEN'S CONVENTION, THEY DECRIED IT. YOU'RE A HELL OF A CROWD. I'LL TELL YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW, AFTER THIS IS OVER, YOU'LL HAVE LIKE AT NBC, THIS THIRD-RATE REPORTER STAND UP. THEY HAD A SMALL CROWD, A INSIGNIFICANT CROWD, IN A GREAT LOCATION. YOU KNOW HOW GREAT IT WAS? WE LANDED, WE HAD TO DRIVE FOR 50 MINUTES. THAT'S HOW GREAT. BUT I LIKE IT ANYWAY. I'LL TAKE IT. I'LL TAKE IT ANYWAY. I LIKE IT. YOU'RE MY KIND OF PEOPLE. WE LOVE EACH OTHER. I LIKE IT. WE LANDED THE BIG, BEAUTIFUL AIR FORCE ONE. I JUST ASKED AS WE'RE COMING IN, 'WHY COULDN'T WE HAVE LANDED HERE?' I WOULD HAVE RATHER, THEN I COULD HAVE HAD THE PLANE RIGHT BEHIND ME. INSTEAD, WE HAVE THE BEAST. SEE THE BEAST. WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IS THE BEAST COSTS ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE PLANE. IT'S A HELL OF A CAR. IT'S A WALKING ARMY TANK, THE BEAST. BUT WE COULD HAVE. I SAID, 'WHY DON'T WE JUST LAND HERE?' AND WE COULDN'T. SO I GET OFF THE PLANE. OH, GOOD. 'HOW LONG WILL IT BE?' ' ABOUT 50 MINUTES.' THAT'S A LONG DRIVE. AND DRIVING HERE, THERE WERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ON THE STREETS WITH FLAGS. AND THEN YOU READ THESE FAKE REPORTERS AND THEY SAY, 'PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TIED IN NEVADA, TIED.' I DON'T THINK SO. THE ONLY WAY WE'RE TIED IS IF THEY SCREW AROUND WITH THE BALLOTS, WHICH THEY WILL DO IN MY OPINION. OKAY? WE'RE NOT TIED ANYWHERE. I ASKED SOME PEOPLE THAT TRAVELED WITH OBAMA. I SAID, 'WAS IT THE SAME THING? THING?' THEY SAY, 'NOT EVEN A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT YOU HAVE.' THERE'S NOT EVEN A FRACTION. WE HAVE MORE ENTHUSIASM. WE HAVE MORE SPIRIT THAN ANY CAMPAIGN THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN. IT'S TRUE. AND THAT INCLUDES 2016, WHERE THE ENTHUSIASM OBVIOUSLY WAS GREAT. HOW ABOUT ALL THOSE STATES THAT WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO WIN? 'NO, HE WON'T WIN THERE. HE WON'T WIN THERE.' THEN ALL NIGHT LONG, 'DONALD TRUMP WON THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS. DONALD TRUMP WON THE GREAT STATE OF ' THIS AND THAT, AND ONE AFTER ANOTHER. WAS THAT ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS, WATCHING THEIR PEOPLE GO CRAZY? THEY WENT CRAZY. NO, THEY WENT CRAZY. HOW IS HE GOING TO DO IN GEORGIA? WELL, I THINK GEORGE IS GOING TO BE VERY CLOSE. IT'S GOING TO BE VERY CLOSE. THEY GO, 'THE POLLS IN GEORGIA HAVE CLOSED. DONALD TRUMP WINS THE STATE OF GEORGIA.' YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE WE WON BY SO MUCH, THAT THEY CAN DO IT SIMULTANEOUSLY BY SAYING, 'THE POLLS CLOSED, AND HE WON.' WE HAD MANY OF THEM. RIGHT? AND BY THE WAY, WE'RE DOING GREAT. I JUST HAD FLORIDA IS A BIGGIE, A GOOD ONE. AND WE ARE WINNING IN FLORIDA BY A LOT, SO THAT'S GOOD. A LOT. I'LL TELL YOU HERE, BECAUSE YOU DON'T READ ABOUT THAT STUFF. THEY DON'T LIKE TO WRITE THAT. THEY DON'T LIKE TO WRITE IT. THEY HAVE ALL FAKE POLLS. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THE POLLS ARE WORSE THAN THE WRITING. ACTUALLY, IN MY OPINION, THE POLLS, THEY'RE SUPPRESSION POLLS, THEY'RE MEANT TO MAKE PEOPLE DISCOURAGED, EVEN ME, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DISCOURAGED. AND FORTUNATELY, FOUR YEARS AGO, WE WEREN'T DISCOURAGED, BECAUSE IF WE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THE POLLS, NOBODY WOULD HAVE VOTED. THE CONCEPT IS REALLY MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SO THAT ON ELECTION, THEY GO, 'DARLING, LET'S GO OUT TO DINNER. IT'S SO SAD ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. I WISH HE WAS GOING TO WIN, BUT LET'S GO OUT TO DINNER. THEN WE'LL COME HOME. LET'S NOT BOTHER VOTING, RIGHT? LET'S NOT BOTHER VOTING.' SEE, IT'S A SUPPRESSION, BUT MY PEOPLE DON'T GET SUPPRESSED. MY PEOPLE GO OUT AND VOTE. MY PEOPLE GO OUT AND VOTE. THERE'S NO SUPPRESSION. PHONY POLLS. HOW ABOUT THE GUY? THE NEW YORK TIMES HIRED THIS POLLSTER, THIS GREAT GENIUS. HE NEVER CALLED ONE WRONG. I DON'T KNOW. 346 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HIS DEAL? YEAH. IT'S SILVER, SILVER, NATE SILVER. THEY PAY HIM A FORTUNE. HE SAID, I THINK HE GAVE US A 2% CHANCE, A 3% CHANCE, 'DONALD TRUMP HAS A 3% CHANCE TODAY OF WINNING.' THE DAMN THING WAS OVER BY 10:00. WE WERE GIVEN A VERY TINY CHANCE. WHAT CHANCE DID HE GIVE US? LIKE 9%, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW, THEY GAVE HIM MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SHORTLY BEFORE, BECAUSE HE NEVER CALLED ONE WRONG. HE CALLED THAT ONE WRONG. HE CALLED THAT ONE WRONG. AND THIS IS THE 1 I MEAN, I MUST TELL YOU THEY'RE A LITTLE MORE ACCURATE. AT LEAST HERE THEY HAVE US EVEN IN A LOT OF PLACES. 'HE'S EVEN.' WELL, WE'RE NOT EVEN, WE'RE NOT EVEN. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE GREATEST VICTORY. THIS IS A MORE IMPORTANT ELECTION THAN FOUR YEARS AGO, I'LL TELL YOU, MORE IMPORTANT. CHEERING BECAUSE AT NO TIME BEFORE, HAS THERE BEEN A CLEARER CHOICE BETWEEN TWO PARTIES OR TWO VISIONS, TWO PHILOSOPHIES, TWO AGENDAS FOR THE FUTURE. THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. ON NOVEMBER 3, NEVADA WILL DECIDE WHETHER WE WILL QUICKLY RETURN TO RECORD PROSPERITY, LIKE WE HAD. WE HAD THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY NOT OF OUR COUNTRY, IN THE WORLD. WE WERE BEATING EVERYBODY. WE WERE BEATING CHINA. REMEMBER, IF YOU GO BACK, SOME OF YOU GO BACK, IF YOU GO BACK 10 YEARS, 15 YEARS, FIVE YEARS, EVERYTHING WAS IN 2019, CHINA WILL OVERTAKE THE UNITED STATES AS THE LARGEST ECONOMY. AND THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL FOR THEM. THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT. WE WERE JUST DOING LEAPS AND BOUNDS. WE WERE DOING SO GREAT, AND THEN WE GOT HIT WITH THE PLAGUE, THE CHINA PLAGUE. AND WE'RE NOT THRILLED. IT'S A DISGRACE. NOBODY SHOULD HAVE DIED. NOBODY SHOULD HAVE DIED. WE GOT HIT. THE WHOLE WORLD GOT HIT, BUT THEY STOPPED IT FROM GOING INTO THE REST OF CHINA. THEY STOPPED IT FROM GOING INTO CHINA, BUT THEY DIDN'T STOP IT FROM COMING INTO THE U.S. AND EUROPE AND 188 COUNTRIES. SO WHETHER OR NOT WE ALLOW BIDEN TO IMPOSE THE BIGGEST TAX INCREASE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, $4 TRILLION, OR BAN HE WANTS TO BAN ENERGY, BAN AMERICAN HE WANTS TO STOP FRACKING. HEY, BY THE WAY, WHEN HE WAS RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT, IN THE WORST DEBATE PERFORMANCES I'VE EVER SEEN. OKAY? WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WAS UNABLE TO ANSWER ANYTHING. ARE YOU AWAKE, SIR? SIR, PLEASE WAKE UP. AND WHO WAS THE WORST? WHO TREATED HIM THE WORST? KAMALA. KAMALA. SHE'S ANOTHER BEAUTY. SHE STARTED OFF AS A FAVORITE. SHE WAS AT 15. THEN SHE WENT DOWN TO 14, TO 12, TO 10. SHE WAS LIKE A DROPPING ROCK IN WATER. SHE WAS GOING DOWN SO FAST. THEN SHE WENT DOWN TO FIVE AND FOUR AND THREE, TWO, AND THEN SHE SAID, 'I GOT TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. THIS IS GETTING EMBARRASSING.' AND NOBODY TREATED HIM WORSE THAN KAMALA. RIGHT? SHE CALLED HIM A RACIST. SHE CALLED HIM EVERYTHING. SHE WAS HORRIBLE TO HIM. AND HE SAYS, 'SHE WAS KAMALA. SHE'S JUST GREAT.' OH, YEAH. THESE PEOPLE, THESE PEOPLE. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CHOOSE THE PEOPLE THAT DID WELL. SHE GOT OUT BEFORE IOWA, AS I REMEMBER. RIGHT? SHE DIDN'T WANT TO RUN IN IOWA, AND THEN BERNIE GOT AGAIN, THIS GUY IS THE GREATEST LOSER EVER BECAUSE NO, NO. NO, HE'S A GOOD SPORT, BERNIE, CRAZY BERNIE. HE'S SO CRAZY, BUT HE'S A GOOD SPORT, BECAUSE WITH HILLARY, THEY REALLY DID. DO WE HAVE ANY YOUNG CHILDREN HERE? I KNOW IT'S ON A LOT OF TELEVISION. COULD YOU TURN THE TELEVISION OFF JUST FOR A MINUTE, JUST FOR ABOUT THREE SECONDS? HE GOT SCREWED. RIGHT? OK. NOW YOU CAN TURN IT BACK ON. BUT THEN THEY REALLY DID WITH THIS LAST ONE, BECAUSE IF POCAHONTAS, ELIZABETH WARREN, IF SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT THE RACE ONE DAY BEFORE THE BIG SUPER TUESDAY, I MEAN, BERNIE WOULD HAVE HER PHILOSOPHY, RIGHT? LIBERALS. BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW WHO'S MORE LIBERAL THAN BERNIE? KAMALA. SHE'S RATED THE NUMBER ONE MOST LIBERAL THIS IS NOT FOR NEVADA. THIS IS NOT FOR AND I WOULD SAY, SHE'LL BE PRESIDENT. IF HE EVER WANTS, SHE'LL BE PRESIDENT WITHIN THE FIRST MONTH OR SO, I WOULD SAY. I THINK IT'S JUST AN EXCUSE. USING HIM AS JUST AN EXCUSE TO GET THE SUPER LIBS IN THERE, SO THEY CAN DESTROY OUR SUBURBS, DEMOLISH OUR SECOND AMENDMENT, ERASE YOUR BORDERS AND INDOCTRINATE YOUR CHILDREN WITH POISONOUS, ANTI-AMERICAN LIES IN SCHOOL. SO UNDER MY LEADERSHIP, WE BUILT THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND NOW WE'RE DOING IT AGAIN. WE'RE DOING IT AGAIN. YOU'VE SEEN THE NUMBERS. AND WE'RE DEVELOPING A VACCINE IN RECORD TIME. IT WILL BE READY BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR AND MAYBE MUCH SOONER THAN THAT. THEY'RE VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THAT. IT'S AMAZING. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF REALLY GREAT EXPERTS, ONE WHO RECALL HIM DR. SCOTT. YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT? HE'S GREAT. HE SAID, THIS IS THE ONLY TIME THEY WERE GRILLING HIM ON TELEVISION, SAYING, 'WELL, THE VACCINE IS GOING TOO FAST.' YOU KNOW WHY THAT'S TOO FAST? BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN BEFORE THE ELECTION. HE SAID, 'THIS IS THE ONLY THING IN THE WORLD. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. EVERYBODY WANTS A VACCINE. AND WHEN WE START GETTING IT FAST, BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAPPENS TO BE PRESIDENT ' AND WE'VE DONE THIS IN RECORD TIME, YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. IF THIS WAS SLEEPY JOE AND OBAMA, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A VACCINE FOR THREE YEARS. BUT LISTEN, HE SAID, 'THIS IS THE CRAZIEST THING.' SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A VACCINE QUICKLY. RIGHT? AND EVERYBODY'S UPSET ABOUT IT. SO NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO HURT THE VACCINE. AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY AS MANY BAD THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT, BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO HURT IT, AND IT'S A SHAME. BUT HE SAID IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY I'VE HEARD. HE SAID, 'YOU'RE TRYING TO HURT THIS COUNTRY BY SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT THE VACCINE, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO PRODUCE IT EARLY.' IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING. THINK ABOUT IT. NOW, HAVING A VACCINE IS GOOD, BUT WE'RE ROUNDING THE TURN REGARDLESS. WE'RE ROUNDING THE TURN, AND IT'S HAPPENING. I MEAN, IT'S HAPPENING. YOU SEE. FLORIDA IS WAY DOWN. TEXAS IS NOW WAY DOWN. ARIZONA, GOVERNOR'S DONE A GREAT JOB. ALL THREE GOVERNORS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB. AND LOUISIANA NOW, THEY HAD A SPIKE, BUT THEY HAD THE SPIKE, BUT THE SPIKE WAS ABLE TO BE HANDLED, BECAUSE NOW WE UNDERSTAND. AND WHAT WE DID, WE SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES, BECAUSE I HATED TO DO IT, BUT WE HAD TO CLOSE IT UP, UNDERSTAND THIS DISEASE, AND THEN OPEN UP AGAIN. AND WE OPENED, BUT WE WOULD HAVE HAD 2 MILLION, TWO AND A HALF, OR 3 MILLION PEOPLE. THINK OF IT. WE'RE AT LIKE AROUND 180,000. ONE IS TOO MANY. ONE, TOO MANY. BUT WE WOULD'VE HAD TWO AND A HALF, THREE, THREE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE. IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTABLE, WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUSTAINABLE. WE'VE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. AND THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE DONE IT WITH ME, THE VENTILATORS, THE VACCINES, THE THERAPEUTICS, THESE PEOPLE I MEAN THE HOSPITALS, THE BEDS THAT WE BUILT, THE SHIPS THAT WE SENT TO NEW YORK, THE SHIPS THAT WE SENT. TO HAVE AN UNGRATEFUL GOVERNOR IN NEW YORK, CUOMO, TO HAVE AN UNGRATEFUL GOVERNOR. WE SENT HIM SHIPS. WE SENT THEM SHIPS. WE SENT THEM. WE BUILT A CONVENTION CENTER WITH 2,800 BEDS, AND HE DIDN'T USE THE BEDS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS. HE HARDLY USED THE BEDS AT ALL. HE HARDLY USED THE SHIPS AT ALL. HE SAID WE DID A PHENOMENAL JOB, AND NOW HE GETS POLITICAL. HE WANTS TO GET POLITICAL WITH ME. A REAL WISE GUY, BUT THAT'S OKAY. YOU GOT TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOING BETWEEN HIM AND DE BLASIO. THAT'S A BEAUTY. WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO MY BEAUTIFUL CITY. I LOVE THAT CITY SO MUCH. WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS SO HORRIBLE. THE HIGHEST TAXES IN THE LAND, CRIME ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY'RE LIKE 300% UP IN CRIME. WE NEED RUDY TO COME OUT OF RETIREMENT. BUT WE'RE DEFEATING THE CHINA VIRUS. WHEN BIDEN WAS VICE PRESIDENT, HE WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER ON THE SWINE FLU, WHICH WAS A MUCH EASIER THING TO HANDLE. JOE BIDEN'S OWN CHIEF OF STAFF SAID THAT WHEN BIDEN MANAGED SWINE FLU IN 2009, THEY QUOTE, 'DID EVERY POSSIBLE THING WRONG.' THIS IS THE GUY THAT WORKED FOR HIM IN CHARGE OF THE SWINE FLU. AND 60 MILLION AMERICANS GOT H1N1 IN A PERIOD OF TIME. AND IT'S JUST PURELY A HE SAID IT WAS JUST WE WERE LUCKY. HE SAID, 'IT'S JUST LUCKY THAT THERE WEREN'T GREAT MASS CASUALTIES.' DIFFERENT KINDS OF A DISEASE, A LITTLE BIT. AND WHAT HE SAID IS AMAZING. HE SAID WE DID NOTHING RIGHT. THIS IS THE MAN THAT'S GOING TO TELL US ALL ABOUT BUILDING VENTILATORS. YOU THINK JOE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THOUSANDS OF VENTILATORS A MONTH? WHICH NOW WE'RE DOING, AND SENDING THEM TO ALL THESE COUNTRIES, ALL OVER THE WORLD, WHO HAVE NO HOPE OF BUILDING VENTILATORS, AND THEY NEED THEM BADLY. SO IT'S AN AMAZING THING. THE OUTBREAK WAS SO RAMPANT THAT OBAMA-BIDEN, THE ADMINISTRATION, TOLD STATES TO STOP TESTING IMMEDIATELY, AND THEY ORDERED THE CDC TO STOP COUNTING CASES BECAUSE THEY LOOKED LIKE HELL, OK? WE DIDN'T DO THAT. BY THE WAY, THE REASON WE SHOW SO MANY CASES, BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BEST TESTING PROGRAM IN THE WORLD, BY FAR, BY FAR. WE'VE TESTED MORE PEOPLE THAN INDIA, THAN MANY, MANY BIG COUNTRIES PUT TOGETHER. INDIA'S SECOND. WE'RE 44 MILLION TESTS AHEAD OF INDIA. THEY HAVE 1.5 BILLION PEOPLE, AND PRIME MINISTER MODI CALLS ME. HE SAYS, 'WHAT A JOB YOU'VE DONE WITH TESTING.' I SAID, 'EXPLAIN THAT TO THESE DISHONEST PEOPLE BACK ' BIDEN'S RECORD DEMONSTRATES THAT IF HE HAD BEEN IN CHARGE WHEN THE CHINA VIRUS ARRIVED, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MORE AMERICANS WOULD HAVE DIED. AS VICE PRESIDENT, HE PRESIDED OVER THE WORST AND THE WEAKEST AND THE SLOWEST ECONOMIC RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. YOU'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE. IT WAS THE MOST PATHETIC RECOVERY SINCE THE DEPRESSION. NO STATE WAS HIT HARDER BY BIDEN'S FAILURE THAN NEVADA. AND I WAS OUT HERE AND THAT RIGHT ABOUT THAT. YOU GOT HIT HARD. THIS IS NOT THE GUY YOU WANT. BUT UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, BEFORE THE VIRUS, WE QUICKLY ACHIEVED THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE HISTORY OF NEVADA. AND WE'LL SOON HAVE IT BACK THERE AGAIN. WE'LL SOON HAVE IT BACK THERE AGAIN, BUT I HOPE EVERYBODY HERE, 25,000 PEOPLE, WHATEVER THE HELL IT IS, INCLUDING THOSE PEOPLE BACK THERE, THEY'RE ANGRY AT ME. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE GAVE THE PRESS THIS GOOD LOCATION BECAUSE IT LOCKS THE PEOPLE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BACK THERE, AND THE PRESS IS BLOCKING THEM. AND I CONSIDER THEM MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN I DO THE PRESS. BUT BIDEN WANTS TO RAISE YOUR TAXES SO HIGH. HE WOULD ERADICATE YOUR ECONOMY. HE'D PUT ON NEW REGULATIONS, AND IT WOULDN'T BE HIM AGAIN. I'M GOING TO KEEP SAYING IT. IT WILL BE THE PEOPLE THAT CONTROL HIM. HE'S A PUPPET. AND THEN HE WANTS TO DO A COMPLETE SHUTDOWN. WE'RE SETTING RECORDS. WE JUST SET A JOB RECORD FOR FOUR MONTHS, 10.4 MILLION PEOPLE. LISTEN TO THIS. SO WHEN WE HAD THIS PANDEMIC WORLDWIDE, LOOK, IT'S A TERRIBLE THING THAT A THING LIKE THIS HAPPENED. PEOPLE WERE SAYING WE COULD GO TO 41%, 42% UNEMPLOYMENT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE NOW? 8.4%. I DON'T SAY THAT'S IF YOU WOULD HAVE SAID THAT AND WE HAVE THE STRONGEST, HIGHEST STOCK MARKET IN HISTORY, SO YOUR 401S ARE DOING GREAT. IF HE GOT IN, WE WOULD HAVE THE GREATEST DEPRESSION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. I MEAN IT. I THINK 1929 WOULD LOOK LIKE GOOD TIMES. ALL RIGHT? BECAUSE HE'D DO EVERYTHING WRONG. HE'D RAISE YOUR TAXES. HE'D RAISED THE HELL OUT OF INTEREST RATES. HE'D DO EVERYTHING WRONG. THE BIDEN SHUTDOWN WILL PERMANENTLY DESTROY THE LIVES AND DREAMS OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, INFLICT TOTALLY LASTING HARM ON OUR CHILDREN AND LEAD COUNTLESS DEATHS FROM SUICIDE. DON'T FORGET WHEN YOU DO THESE SHUTDOWNS, YOUR STATE IS SHUT DOWN. YOU GOT A GOVERNOR. YOU SHUT DOWN, EXCEPT IF YOU HAVE A RIOT. YOU'RE NOT SHUT DOWN FOR RIOTS. RIOTS, YOU CAN HAVE, THEY CAN BURN THE HELL OUT OF THE STRIP. THEY CAN BURN THE HELL OUT OF RENO. THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL THEY WANT IF IT'S A RIOT. BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO TO CHURCH, YOU CAN'T DO IT. IF YOU WANT TO BE IN A GROUP OF PEOPLE, YOU CAN'T DO IT. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF HARM DONE ON THE OTHER SIDE. THERE'S A LOT OF TREMENDOUS HARM DONE. REMEMBER, THE CURE CAN'T BE WORSE. REMEMBER THAT. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, DRUGS, SUICIDE, DEPRESSION, SUBSTANCE ABUSE OF DIFFERENT KINDS, HEART DISEASE. YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS ON THE OTHER SIDE. OPEN YOUR SCHOOLS, OPEN UP. WE GOT TO OPEN UP THIS STATE. AND I GUARANTEE YOU AND BY THE WAY, THE STATES THAT ARE OPEN ARE DOING REALLY WELL. THEY'RE DOING MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES THAT ARE CLOSED. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN SEEING THE NUMBERS. AND THIS IS JUST ARITHMETIC. THE STATES THAT ARE OPEN ARE DOING GREAT. THE STATES THAT ARE CLOSED, NORTH CAROLINA, WHAT HE'S DOING TO THAT GREAT STATE, HE'S GOT IT LOCKED DOWN, SHUT DOWN. MICHIGAN, WHAT SHE'S DOING. AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET BIG 10 FOOTBALL BY THE WAY, BUT WE WON'T EVEN. MICHIGAN, WHAT SHE'S DOING TO MICHIGAN IS UNBELIEVABLE. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO PENNSYLVANIA. AND HERE'S ANOTHER GOVERNOR IN CHARGE OF MILLIONS OF BALLOTS. SO I'M GOING TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA, BUT WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO WITH THESE BALLOTS? WHERE ARE THEY GOING? WHO ARE THEY SENDING? WHO'S SENDING IT BACK? WHO'S SIGNING? THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE AN AUTHORIZED SIGNATURE IN NEVADA. DO YOU KNOW THAT? THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE AN AUTHORIZED SIGNATURE ON A BALLOT? NO. THEY'RE TRYING TO RIG AN ELECTION, AND WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. I HOPE YOU'RE ALL GOING TO BE POLL-WATCHERS, I HOPE YOU ARE, BECAUSE WITH YOU PEOPLE WATCHING THE POLLS, IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY HARD TO CHEAT. I'LL TELL YOU, I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE A CHEATER. THEY'LL FIGURE A WAY. NO, THEY ARE. IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS THING. IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS THING, AND I TOTALLY MEAN IT. AND I'VE BEEN AT IT. AND YOU SEE PEOPLE. AND BY THE WAY, IT'S NOT EVEN POLITICS. IT'S COMMON SENSE. THEY SAID MILLIONS OF BALLOTS. PEOPLE ARE GETTING BALLOTS. PEOPLE DIED AND THEY'RE GETTING BALLOTS. THEY'RE SENDING THEM TO DOGS. YOU SEE THAT? DOGS GOT BALLOT. EVERYBODY'S GETTING BALLOTS. PROBABLY EVERYBODY, BUT REPUBLICAN ARE GOING TO GET THE BALLOTS. RIGHT? AND THEY'RE UNSOLICITED. SO WHEN YOU SAY, SOLICITED, BECAUSE I LIKE SOLICITED BETTER AS A WORD THAN ABSENTEE. ABSENTEE, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE HELL IT'S SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT. IT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD DEFINITION. ONE IS SOLICITED, WHERE YOU ASK YOU SOLICIT THE BALLOT. YOU WANT IT, YOU SIGN PAPERS. THEY SEND IT TO YOU. YOU SEND IT BACK. IT'S OKAY. IT'S GOOD. BUT UNSOLICITED, WHERE THEY TAKE MILLIONS OF BALLOTS. SO WHAT HAPPENS? I HAPPEN TO THINK THE POSTAL PEOPLE ARE GREAT, BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF ONE OF THE POST GUYS, BEFORE HE GIVES THE BALLOTS, HE TAKES A WHOLE HANDFUL AND HANDS THEM TO SOME DEMOCRAT POLITICAL OPERATIVE, RIGHT? AND SO, HE HANDS HIM A THOUSAND BALLOTS, AND THE GUY DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE VERIFICATION TO DO THAT. NOW, HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS. WE'RE IN FRONT OF A COURT. AND HOPEFULLY, THE COURT'S GOING TO RULE, BECAUSE THIS IS THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS. THESE PEOPLE ARE THEY'VE GONE CRAZY. BIDEN AND HIS PARTY OF LIBERAL HYPOCRITES WANT TO LOCK LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS IN THEIR HOMES, WHICH IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND THEY WANT TO KEEP THEM OUT OF CHURCH. THEY REALLY DO. THEY'RE FIGHTING GOD, THEY'RE FIGHTING GUNS, AND THEY'RE FIGHTING OIL. THINK OF IT. I DON'T THINK THEY'LL DO TOO WELL IN TEXAS. DID YOU SEE WHERE THEY SAID? 'WE THINK THE RACE WILL BE QUITE CLOSE IN TEXAS, BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS AN EDGE.' LISTEN, I'M IN FAVOR OF OIL AND ENERGY. I'M IN FAVOR OF RELIGION AND GOD. OK? AND I'M IN FAVOR OF OUR GREAT SECOND AMENDMENT, GUNS. SO HE'S AGAINST OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. OK, YOU KNOW WHO HE'D PUT IN CHARGE. BETO, BETO. OR AS HE SAYS IS, 'BETO, BETO.' SO WHEN BETO WAS LEGIT AND THEN TED CRUZ BEAT HIM, AND TED DID A VERY GOOD JOB. I TELL YOU, HE DID A GREAT JOB. BUT BETO WENT TOTALLY SOUTH. HE'S GONE CRAZY. SO HE NOW IS A BIG GUN GUY. HE WANTS TO TAKE GUNS AWAY FROM EVERYBODY. SO WHO DID BIDEN PUT IN CHARGE? BETO. REMEMBER BETO WAS INTERVIEWED IN SOME MAGAZINE OR THIRD-RATE MAGAZINE, MOST OF THEM ARE, BUT REMEMBER? AND BETO SAID, THIS WAS AT THE BEGINNING BEFORE HE GOT BEAT TO HELL. I SAID, 'HE THOUGHT THIS WAS EASY, DIDN'T HE?' BUT REMEMBER WHEN BETO SAID, 'I WAS BORN FOR THIS.' AS SOON AS I HEAR SOMEBODY'S BORN FOR RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, I SAID, 'HE'S OUT. THAT'S THE END OF HIM.' NOBODY'S BORN FOR THIS. THIS IS TOUGH STUFF. I HAD A GREAT LIFE, I'LL TELL YOU. MY LIFE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. WHAT THE HELL DID I DO THIS FOR? BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ARE DOING THINGS THAT NOBODY'S EVER DONE BEFORE. AND I SAY IT ALL THE TIME, AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME HAPPY. WE'RE DEALING WITH VERY SICK AND VERY BAD AND EVIL PEOPLE. BUT I'LL TELL YOU NO ADMINISTRATION IN THREE AND A HALF YEARS, NO ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE FIRST THREE AND A HALF YEARS. BUT THEY WANT TO PUNISH YOU FOR PRAYING IN CHURCH WHILE THEY LET AGITATORS AND ARSONISTS BURN YOUR CHURCHES DOWN. LOOK AT WASHINGTON. THEY WANT TO BURN THE CHURCHES DOWN, AND THAT'S FINE. BUT YOU WANT TO GO PRAY IN CHURCH, THEY WON'T LET YOU DO THAT. JUST LAST WEEK, BIDEN PROUDLY ACCEPTED THE ENDORSEMENT OF PRO-CRIMINAL, ANTI-POLICE, PORTLAND DISTRICT ATTORNEY, WHO HAS A POLICY OF RELEASING RIOTERS, VANDALS, CRIMINALS, AND VIOLENT EXTREMISTS WITHOUT ANY CHARGES. NO CHARGES. NEVER SAW ANYTHING. BY THE WAY, ALL OF THESE PLACES WERE TALKING ABOUT ARE DEMOCRAT- RUN, CHICAGO, NEW YORK, PORTLAND, SEATTLE. THE ONLY REASON SEATTLE GOT SETTLED, BECAUSE THEY KNEW WE WERE GOING IN. WE TOLD THEM, 'WE'RE GOING IN TOMORROW MORNING. WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT.' IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US 20 MINUTES. SO THEY SENT PEOPLE THAT NIGHT, BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE EMBARRASSED. BUT LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE. AND SO, EVERY PLACE WE'VE TOUCHED, WE SOLVED THE CRIME, BUT THEY HAVE TO ASK US. IF THEY DON'T ASK US, WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO IT, BUT MAYBE WE DO IT ANYWAY. AND IT USUALLY TAKES ANYWHERE FROM 25 MINUTES TO ABOUT ONE HOUR. WASN'T THAT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT THOUGH IN MINNEAPOLIS, RIGHT? THEY'RE BURNING THE POOR CITY DOWN. I LOVE THAT STATE. I THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING IN THAT STATE, FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS FOR A REPUBLICAN. THEY'RE BURNING MINNEAPOLIS. YOU DON'T THINK OF MINNEAPOLIS THAT WAY, RIGHT? YOU DON'T THINK OF IT. THE CITY IS BURNING DOWN. YOU HAVE THIS FAKE CNN REPORTER, WHAT'S HIS NAME? VELSHI, THE NICE SHAVED HEAD. MAYBE I SHOULD TRY THAT, SHOULD I TRY THAT? NO, I DON'T THINK. 'DONALD TRUMP WENT DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE POLLS, LIKE ABOUT 40%.' HE SHOWED UP WITH A NEW HAIRCUT, IT IS CALLED THE SHAVED HEAD. ALI VELSHI. AND REMEMBER HE SAID, 'NO, THIS IS A FRIENDLY PROTEST. IT'S A FRIENDLY PROTEST. AND IT'S REALLY QUITE NICE.' AND PEOPLE ARE THROWING BOTTLES AT HIM, HE'S BEING HIT WITH TEAR GAS. THIS IS A FRIENDLY PROTEST. AND YOU LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER AND THE ENTIRE CITY WAS BURNING. DO YOU REMEMBER THE SCENE? THE THING LOOKED LIKE IT WAS 30 BLOCKS, IT WAS JUST BURNING. AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT, THIS IS ALL FAKE NEWS AND NOBODY WOULD HAVE KNOWN. I KNEW IT BEFORE I DID IT, BUT I NEVER KNEW IT TO THIS EXTENT. I NEVER KNEW IT TO THIS EXTENT. IT IS CORRUPT. IT'S FAKE AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO DO IT. THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED. THESE ARE FAR LEFT LUNATICS THAT BIDEN SELECTS TO STAFF HIS GOVERNMENT. THERE ARE POLICIES BIDEN'S PLEDGED TO APPLY NATIONWIDE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SUBURBS, THEY HAVE A PLAN. IT DOESN'T MATTER, IT'S A REGULATION, VERY HORRIBLE REGULATION FOR THE DOES ANYBODY LIVE IN THE SUBURBS? BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T VOTE FOR TRUMP IN THE SUBURBS, OK. WOMEN THAT LIVE IN THE SUBURBS. THEY SAY, 'OH, THEY DON'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP.' I SAID I THINK THEY DO. REMEMBER LAST TIME, REMEMBER IT'S THE SAME THING. NO, IT'S THE SAME THING. REMEMBER, LAST TIME, FOUR YEARS AGO, 'DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT DO WELL WITH WOMEN.' I SAID, WHY? AM I SO BAD? AND THEN THE VOTES STARTED COMING IN. 'HE'S DOING VERY WELL, JIM, WITH WOMEN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.' WE DID VERY WELL WITH WOMEN. WE DID WELL WITH EVERYBODY, WE DID WELL WITH EVERYBODY. BUT THEY HAVE A REGULATION. AND BEN CARSON WAS FANTASTIC, THE HEAD OF HUD. I SAID, 'BEN, THEY'RE GOING TO DESTROY THE SUBURBS.' AND THEY WANTED COREY BOOKER TO HEAD THAT PROGRAM. BUT THE PROGRAM WAS ALREADY DOING DAMAGE. THEY WERE PLAYING WITH THE ZONING SO THEY COULD BUILD PROJECTS IN THE SUBURB, PROJECTS IN THE SUBURBS. AND I SAID, 'WE'RE GOING TO END IT.' SOMEBODY SAID, 'SIR, LET'S JUST AMEND IT.' I SAID, 'NOPE, WE GOT TO END IT. END IT, I WANT TO END IT. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A LESSER VERSION.' BUT IF HE GETS IN, THEY WILL OPEN UP THAT WHOLE PROGRAM. THEY'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP ON STEROIDS. THEY'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP TO A LEVEL THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED POSSIBLE. AND HE WILL DRIVE YOU OUT OF THE SUBURBS. HE WILL DRIVE YOU OUT OF THE HE'LL DRIVE YOU OUT OF EVERYTHING. THEY ARE GOING TO UP AND UP I CALL IT THE SUBURBAN DESTRUCTION PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE DONE. AND IT'S BEEN A HORRIBLE PROGRAM. IT'S BEEN VERY UNFAIR TO PEOPLE WITH THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING. 30% OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE SUBURBS ARE MINORITIES. THEY'RE HISPANIC, THEY'RE BLACK, THEY'RE ASIAN, IT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND THEY WANT THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THEY DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. THAT'S WHY I'M DOING SO WELL WITH AFRICAN AMERICAN, WITH ASIAN AMERICAN, WITH HISPANIC AMERICAN AND WITH WOMEN. BUT DON'T LET THEM RUIN THE SUBURBS BECAUSE THEY WILL PUT THAT REGULATION BACK IMMEDIATELY, IMMEDIATELY. AND DON'T LET THEM RUIN THE SUBURBS BECAUSE THE SUBURBS ARE A SPECIAL PLACE. THE SUBURBS ARE THE AMERICAN DREAM. THAT'S WHERE EVERYONE ASPIRES TO AND THAT INCLUDES MINORITIES AND EVERYBODY. DON'T LET THEM RUIN THE SUBURBS. AND WITH THAT COMES TREMENDOUS CRIME. AND I WAS TALKING THE OTHER DAY, 'DARLING, SOMEBODY JUST MOVED NEXT DOOR. WHO IS IT? IT'S A REPRESENTATIVE OF ANTIFA.' SHE WILL LOOK AT HER HUSBAND, SAY, 'DARLING, WE'RE OUT OF HERE. WE ARE OUT OF HERE.' ANTIFA. REMEMBER THEY WERE TRYING TO BLAME OTHER PEOPLE. THEY DON'T LIKE TO MENTION THE NAME ANTIFA. I SAID, IT'S ANTIFA AND I WAS RIGHT. I WAS RIGHT. THEY'RE BAD PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY HAVE TO PAY A PRICE FOR THE DAMAGE AND FOR THE HORROR THAT THEY'VE CAUSED, THEY HAVE TO PAY A PRICE. AND IT'S SO EASY. IT'S SO EASY. A LOT OF THEM NOW ARE WEALTHY. THEY'RE LIKE THESE WEALTHY, SPOILED KIDS THAT HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT LIFE. THEY'VE GOT ARMS THAT ARE ABOUT THIS BIG BUT THEY WERE HEAVY THEY WEAR HEAVY JACKETS WITH LOTS AND YOU LOOK AND YOU SAY, 'OH, THAT GUY LOOKS TOUGH.' AND THEN THE JACKET COMES OFF AND YOU SEE THESE TWO LITTLE AND THEY GO HOME AND THEY LIVE IN A BASEMENT TOO, THEIR MOM AND DAD'S BASEMENT. BUT BIDEN'S PLAN IS TO APPEASE DOMESTIC TERRORISTS AND MY PLAN IS TO ARREST DOMESTIC TERRORISTS. JOE BIDEN IS A WEAK PERSON. HE DOES WHATEVER HIS LEFT WING, PUPPET MASTERS DEMAND, YOU KNOW THAT. LOOK, JOE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, YOU KNOW THAT. I MEAN, LET'S BE NICE ABOUT IT, OK. AND I'M BEING NICE WHEN I SAY IT. HE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY, YOUR LOVED ONES OR YOUR COMMUNITY. IF BIDEN'S ELECTED, HIS RADICAL SUPPORTERS WON'T JUST CAUSE MAYHEM ON THE STREETS LIKE YOU'RE SEEING, ALL DEMOCRATS. WE COULD SOLVE IT SO FAST. CHICAGO, A FEW WEEKENDS, THINK OF IT, 72 PEOPLE SHOT, THIS IS SHOT. SOMEBODY SAID, 'YOU MEAN WITH BULLETS?' I SAID, 'YEAH, WITH BULLETS.' 18 PEOPLE DIED. NOW WE'RE PULLING OUR TROOPS OUT OF AFGHANISTAN, OUT OF IRAQ, YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THAT OVER THERE. THEY DON'T HAVE 18 PEOPLE KILLED OR 12 PEOPLE IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. YOU HAVE 70 PEOPLE SHOT, WHERE YOU HAVE ANOTHER WEEKEND WHERE THEY HAD, I THINK A FEW WEEKENDS AGO, 38 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOT IN CHICAGO. I SAID, 38? IT'S NOT EVEN BELIEVABLE. AND NOW WHEN THESE PEOPLE SAY IT, THEY MAKE IT THEY TRY AND PLAY IT DOWN. AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE, I SAID, 'DID I JUST SEE 38 PEOPLE WERE SHOT?' IT'S JUST A TERRIBLE THING. AND IT COULD ALL BE STOPPED. IT COULD ALL BE STOPPED SO QUICKLY. BUT THEY HAVE TO RESPECT LAW AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE ORDER. LAW AND ORDER. BUT THESE RADICAL LEFTS WILL BE RUNNING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. AND YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. IF WE DON'T THE NEXT PRESIDENT, HOPEFULLY IT'S GOING TO BE US, NOT ME, US, BUT THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE ONE, TWO, THREE OR FOUR SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, JUST THAT TIME, RIGHT? JUST THAT TIME, GOING TO BE A MINIMUM OF ONE, I WOULD SAY, BUT IT WILL BE A ONE, TWO, THREE OR FOUR. AND THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WHOLE MAKEUP OF THE SUPREME COURT. THAT'S GOING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS. THAT'S GOING TO DESTROY YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WHOLE RATIONALE THINKING ON SO MANY DIFFERENT SUBJECTS LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE, INCLUDING BY THE WAY, LIFE, OK. LIFE, PRO-LIFE, ANYBODY PRO-LIFE HERE? NO, THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE THE MAKEUP OF THIS COUNTRY FOR 50 YEARS. I DON'T KNOW THAT THE COUNTRY WILL SURVIVE 50 YEARS, IF THAT HAPPENS, IT MIGHT NOT SURVIVE FIVE YEARS IF THAT HAPPENS. BUT THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND YOU SAW, I PUT OUT A LIST OF AN ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF VERY CONSERVATIVE, HIGHLY THOUGHT OF, HIGHLY RESPECTED JUDGES. AND THEY ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT I WILL PICK. MEANING THE FIRST LIST, THE SECOND LIST, IT'S ABOUT 44, 45 PEOPLE. THEY ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT I WILL CONSIDER FOR THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND I'M ASKING JOE BIDEN TO DO THE SAME THING, BUT HE CAN'T BECAUSE HE'S GOT A BUNCH OF RADICAL LEFT MANIACS THAT THEY WANT TO PUT ON THE COURT. AND NOBODY CAN GET ELECTED, NOT EVEN WITH DEMOCRATS, RATIONAL DEMOCRATS, WILL THEY VOTE FOR SOME OF THESE PEOPLE TO BE ON. SO FAR HE'S REFUSED TO DO IT. I'M PROBABLY FORCING HIM TONIGHT TO DO SOMETHING, BUT HE SHOULD PUT OUT A LIST OF HIS JUDGES SO THAT YOU KNOW WHERE YOU STAND. BIDEN SUPPORTS CUTTING POLICE FUNDING, YOU KNOW THAT, ABOLISHING AND BY THE WAY, DID YOU SEE, WE JUST GOT CHICAGO POLICE TODAY ENDORSED TRUMP. THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO. CHICAGO. NEW YORK'S FINEST, NEW YORK'S FINEST ENDORSE, FLORIDA, OHIO, TEXAS. WE HAVE EVERYBODY. IS THERE A POLICE OFFICER IN THE COUNTRY, IF THERE IS, THEY'LL DO A COMMERCIAL. THIS OFFICER LOVES SLEEPY JOE BIDEN, HE'S SO TOUGH ON CRIME. SO BIDEN'S BEEN GOING DOWN VERY RAPIDLY IN THE POLLS. AND NOW WHAT HE'S DOING IS HE'S PLAYING TOUGH GUY, THAT HE'S TOUGH ON CRIME. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE GOES FROM DEMOLISHED, DEMOLISH AND DEFUND, OKAY? BUT HE GOES FROM, LET'S NOT GIVE THE POLICE ANY MONEY. LET'S NOT EVEN SAY DEFUND FOR HIM. HIS PEOPLE WANT TO DEFUND THE POLICE. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE PLACES, SEATTLE, THEY ACTUALLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE POLICE. MINNEAPOLIS, THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE POLICE. THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE POLICE. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? YOU SAW THE COMMERCIAL WE PUT UP. A WOMAN'S BEING MURDERED. 'I'M SORRY. WE CANNOT TAKE YOUR CALL RIGHT NOW. WE WILL CALL YOU BACK WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.' A WOMAN'S BEING RAPED, RIGHT? 'I'M SORRY. WE COULD NOT RESPOND RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN DEFUNDED, BUT WE WILL TRY GETTING THERE WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK.' THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. I MEAN, THAT WAS A STRONG COMMERCIAL. IT HAD A BIG IMPACT, BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE BUYING WITH A GUY LIKE THIS. THIS GUY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PORTLANDS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY. AND WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. 'NOT HERE,' HE SAYS, 'NOT HERE IN NEVADA.' WELL WITH YOUR GOVERNOR, IT COULD HAPPEN HERE TOO, I CAN TELL. THEY WANT TO ABOLISH BAIL. SO THEY WANT TO ABOLISH CASH BAIL LIKE THEY DID IN NEW YORK. THEY RELEASE PEOPLE, THE HORRIBLE CRIMINALS IN NEW YORK, THEY RELEASE THEM, NO CASH BAIL. AND HE CALLS LAW ENFORCEMENT, BIDEN CALLED LAW ENFORCEMENT THE ENEMY. THEY'RE NOT THE ENEMY. THEY'RE OUR FRIENDS. THEY'RE OUR GREAT FRIENDS. AND WITHOUT THEM, WE WOULDN'T BE HERE. HERE IN NEVADA RIOTERS BURNED THE CITY HALL IN RENO. DOES ANYBODY KNOW THAT? DO YOU KNOW THAT? THAT'S NOT A PLEASANT SIGHT. HOW DID YOU ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN? I WOULD'VE THOUGHT YOU PEOPLE WOULD'VE GOTTEN OUT THERE, LIKE, 'YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BURN OUR CITY HALL.' AND DURING THE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS IN LAS VEGAS A 29-YEAR-OLD POLICE OFFICER, YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS, WAS DELIBERATELY SHOT IN THE HEAD WHILE HE WAS DOING HIS JOB, A VICIOUS CRIMINAL LEFT, HE WAS A LEFT PERSON, A LEFT. HE WAS A REAL LEFT, ALL RIGHT. AND THE, THE YOUNG OFFICER AS YOU KNOW, HE'S A YOUNG, BRILLIANT, YOUNG GUY AND HE'S TOTALLY PARALYZED. UNLIKE BIDEN, WHILE I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I WILL ALWAYS STAND WITH THE HEROES OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND ON NOVEMBER 3, YOU WILL SAVE AMERICA. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SAVING AMERICA. WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN EVER COME BACK FROM WHAT WILL HAPPEN, INCLUDING OUR SUPREME COURT. WE'RE JOINED TONIGHT BY OUR TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL NOMINEE, WHO HAS MY COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT. JIM, WHERE YOU JIM? JIM MARCHANT, JIM MARCHANT, WHERE ARE YOU? A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE, JIM, IT'S NOT EASY. ARE YOU DOING WELL? I JUST LOOKED AT A VERY SOLID POLL. JIM MARCHANT IS A GREAT GUY AND HOPEFULLY HE'S GOING TO WIN AND YOU'RE GOING TO CARRY THEM OVER AND YOU NEED IT, YOU NEED IT. THANK YOU, JIM. AND ALSO TO A MAN THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOVERNOR. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOVERNOR, WHAT HAPPENED? I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. NEVADA ATTORNEY GENERAL, HE'S A GREAT GUY, ADAM LAXALT. AND HE'S WATCHING VERY CLOSELY. AND I'LL TELL YOU, ADAM, PLEASE, HE'S A GREAT LAWYER, A GREAT TALENT. AND HE'S GOING PLACES BUT YOU HAVE TO WATCH. HE JUST SAID, OUR NEXT GOVERNOR. I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE. YOU HAVE MY ENDORSEMENT, BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS, ADAM, IF YOU COULD, BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB WATCHING, WATCH ALL THESE VOTES COMING IN ON THE BALLOTS, THE UNSOLICITED BALLOTS. WILL YOU WATCH IT, PLEASE? OK, ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW. ALL RIGHT, JAMES SETTELMEYER. WHERE'S JAMES? JAMES, LOOK AT JAMES, WHOA. LOOK AT THE SIZE OF JAMES, I WANT YOU PROTECTING ME, JAMES. JAMES IS GOOD. YOU'RE DOING WELL, I SAW A GOOD POLL FOR YOU TOO. I THINK WE'RE ALL DOING WELL. I THINK WE'RE ALL DOING WELL, IT'S LIKE A FAMILY. THANK YOU JAMES VERY MUCH. ALL OF YOU GUYS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A WOMAN WHO DID A FANTASTIC JOB, SHE HEADED UP MICHIGAN. WE WON MICHIGAN, THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES, REPUBLICANS WON. SHE WAS HORRENDOUS, SHE KEPT CALLING ME, 'SIR, ONE MORE SPEECH, PLEASE COME OVER. OKAY, I'LL DO ONE MORE, RONNA, RONNA MCDANIEL. I'LL DO ONE MORE, RONNA, ONE MORE.' I DO THE SPEECH, TWO DAYS LATER, I GET A CALL. 'ONE MORE, SIR. WE NEED ONE MORE.' BUT WE ENDED UP WINNING MICHIGAN, FIRST TIME IN DECADES. RONNA MCDANIEL, RONNA. SHE WAS GREAT. AND I SAID WHEN I WON, I SAID, 'WELL, WHO ARE WE GOING TO PUT AT THE RNC?' THAT'S REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, WHO WE'RE GOING TO PUT? AND I SAID, 'HOW ABOUT THAT WOMAN THAT RAN ' SHE WAS SO TOUGH. I SAID, 'HOW ABOUT THE WOMAN THAT RAN MICHIGAN THAT WE WON, FIRST TIME IN SO MANY YEARS?' SO THANK YOU, RONNA, GREAT JOB YOU'RE DOING, WE APPRECIATE IT. AND ANOTHER MAN IS DOING A FANTASTIC JOB, WHO'S BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME, YOUR GOP CHAIR, MICHAEL MCDONALD. MICHAEL, GREAT JOB, MICHAEL. THANK YOU, MICHAEL. THANK YOU, MIKE. HOW ARE WE DOING, MICHAEL? ARE WE LEADING, I HOPE? OK. I HEAR WE'RE DOING WELL. BE CAREFUL OF THE BALLOTS, THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO LOSE. CAN'T HAVE THIS HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY. AND ALSO HERE ARE SEVERAL REALLY GREAT MEMBERS OF A TERRIFIC ASSOCIATION AND THEY LIKE TRUMP A LOT, THE NEVADA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION. WHERE ARE THEY, NEVADA TRUCKING? NEVADA TRUCKING, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, FELLAS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT JOB, WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. THOSE ROADS ARE GOING TO GET VERY NICE. THEY'RE ALREADY STARTING. TONIGHT OUR HEARTS ARE WITH ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES IN THE WEST BATTLING DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. I'M GOING THERE THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. I'M STAYING IN YOUR STATE TONIGHT, BUT I'M GOING TO BE GOING TO CALIFORNIA. SPOKE TO THE FOLKS IN OREGON, WASHINGTON, THEY NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS, BUT IT IS ABOUT FOREST MANAGEMENT. PLEASE REMEMBER THE WORDS, VERY SIMPLE, FOREST MANAGEMENT, PLEASE REMEMBER. IT'S ABOUT FOREST MANAGEMENT AND OTHER THINGS BUT FOREST MANAGEMENT. MY ADMINISTRATION IS CLOSELY COORDINATING WITH STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS AND WE WANT TO THANK THE MORE THAN 200,000 PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING ON IT AND 28,000 FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS WHO COURAGEOUSLY AND BRAVELY ARE FIGHTING OUT THERE. THEY ARE FIGHTING AND IT'S DANGEROUS, IT'S DANGEROUS. IT'S RAPIDLY SPREADING, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES, IT'S NOT BEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS ONE. WE SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS REVERSING THE HORRIBLE DAMAGE JOE BIDEN INFLICTED OVER THE PAST 47 YEARS. THINK OF IT, HE'S BEEN THERE 47 YEARS. AND HE ALWAYS SAYS, 'WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU DO THIS?' THE GUY JUST REALLY IN ALL FAIRNESS, I'VE BEEN HERE THREE AND A HALF YEARS. SO IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN HERE. HE WAS A VICE PRESIDENT FOR EIGHT YEARS AND HE ONLY DID ONE THING GOOD. HE TREATED OBAMA GOOD. I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE, BUT THEY WOULD HAVE SCOLDED ME. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY, BUT I DIDN'T. IT'S BETTER THAN YOU SAY IT. DO YOU WANT TO SHOUT IT OUT? GO AHEAD, SHOUT. THAT'S WHAT I SAID, THAT IS WHAT I WAS THANK YOU VERY THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN IN NEVADA. AND WE PASS RECORD TAX CUTS AND REGULATION CUTS TO KEEP THE FAMILY FARMS AND RANCHES IN THE FAMILY. NOBODY EVEN KNOWS THIS. WE VIRTUALLY ELIMINATED THE UNFAIR ESTATE TAX, ALSO KNOWN AS THE DEATH TAX. DOES ANYONE HAVE A SMALL FARM, MEDIUM-SIZED FARM OR BUSINESS? ANYBODY? IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE IT TO YOUR CHILDREN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY TAX NOW BECAUSE OF TRUMP. I ALWAYS SAY IT AND I MEAN IT, IF YOU LIKE YOUR CHILDREN, IT'S IF YOU LIKE YOUR CHILDREN, IT'S GREAT. IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR CHILDREN, IT DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN THING, DON'T LEAVE IT TO THEM. I ENDED THE ADMINISTRATIONS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT LAST ADMINISTRATION, WHAT THEY WERE DOING ON AMERICAN ENERGY, WHAT THEY WERE DOING, AND NOW WE ARE THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE ENERGY PRODUCER BY FAR AND WE ARE ENERGY INDEPENDENT. HOW ABOUT YOUR GAS PRICES? THAT'S NOT TOO BAD, RIGHT? YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU'D EVER SEE THOSE PRICES, THOSE UNDER TWO DOLLAR PRICES, DID YOU? THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP, I APPRECIATE IT, SIR. BIDEN HAS PLEDGED TO ABOLISH THE PRODUCTION OF AMERICAN OIL AND SHALE AND CLEAN COAL AND NATURAL GAS, AND HE WANTS TO BAN FRACKING, RIGHT? SO HE'S IN THESE DEBATES WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY'RE JUST EATING HIM ALIVE. HE DID HIS BEST DEBATE AGAINST CRAZY BERNIE AND I GOT TO ASK, WHY DID HE GET BETTER, ALL OF A SUDDEN? WHAT HAPPENED? WHY, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY? I THINK I KNOW. WHY DID HE GET BETTER ALL OF A SUDDEN? BUT HE DID HIS LAST EVENT, BUT HE WAS SO BAD. AND HE RAISED HIS HAND, NO FRACKING. 'THERE WILL BE NO FRACKING UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION,' HE SAID. AND YOU KNOW WHY I ADD THE WORD, HE SAID, BECAUSE THEY WILL TAKE WHAT I SAID AND THEY WILL PUT IT AS A COMMERCIAL. THERE WILL BE NO FRACKING UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, THEY'LL HAVE ME SAYING THAT. THAT'S HOW DISHONEST THESE PEOPLE ARE. SO I ALWAYS HAVE TO ADD SOMETHING BECAUSE BUT EVEN THEN SOMETIMES THEY'LL CUT IT OFF AT THE END. BUT HE SAID, THERE'LL BE NO FRACKING UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION. NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN HE GOES TO PENNSYLVANIA AND HIS POLLS AREN'T LOOKING VERY GOOD BECAUSE THEY DO BIG FRACKING. AND HE GOES TO TEXAS AND HE GOES TO OKLAHOMA AND HE GOES TO NORTH DAKOTA AND HE GOES TO ALL THESE PLACES. IT'S NOT LOOKING SO GOOD. ALL OF A SUDDEN HE SAYS, 'I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST FRACKING. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? BUT ALWAYS FOLLOW THEIR FIRST INSTINCT BECAUSE THE FIRST INSTINCT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. AND HE HAS TO, BECAUSE HE SIGNED HE HAS A MANIFESTO. I CALL IT THE MANIFESTO WITH BERNIE AND AOC PLUS THREE, ALL THESE CRAZY PEOPLE. AND IT'S A MANIFESTO AND IT READS FAR WORSE THAN ANYTHING BERNIE SANDERS EVER SAID. I THOUGHT HE'D TAKE WHAT BERNIE DID AND MOVE THEM SOMEWHAT TO THE RIGHT. NO, HE TOOK WHAT BERNIE SAID AND THEY MOVED WAY FURTHER LEFT. IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN. BUT FOLLOW THE ORIGINAL STATEMENTS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WHETHER IT'S ON RELIGION OR ON GUNS OR ON FRACKING OR ON ENERGY OR ANYTHING, THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED THIS EXTREME AGENDA AND THEY ARE EXPERIENCING MASSIVE BLACKOUTS, YOU KNOW THAT, CALIFORNIA. THEY LIKE WIND, THEY LIKE WIND. 'OH, DARLING, LET'S WATCH TELEVISION. I'M SORRY, DARLING. THE WIND, THE WIND ISN'T BLOWING TONIGHT WE CAN'T WATCH TELEVISION. BUT I WANT TO WATCH PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE'S ON TELEVISION. I WANT TO WATCH HIM. DARLING, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU? THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING TONIGHT.' AND THE GOVERNMENT CAME AND TURNED OFF ALL THE WINDMILLS BECAUSE THEY'RE KILLING ALL OUR BALD EAGLES AND ALL OUR BIRDS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. YOU WANT TO SEE A BIRD CEMETERY WALK UNDER A WINDMILL SOMETIME. THEY PILE UP. HONESTLY, IT'S TERRIBLE. THEN THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS WILL SAY, OH, THAT'S SO WONDERFUL. YOU KNOW WHAT, WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT FUMES, WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT GOING UP, THE CARBON, GOING UP, TAKE A LOOK WHERE THEY'RE MADE. THEY'RE MADE IN CHINA AND THEY'RE MADE IN GERMANY. THEY SPEW MORE CRAP INTO THE AIR THAN ANYTHING. YOU CAN RUN THOSE THINGS FOR 15 YEARS AND THEY'LL NEVER MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. BUT HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS, THEY WEAR OUT. AND DID YOU EVER SEE A WINDMILL WHEN IT'S SHOT, LIKE JOE, WHAT HAPPENS? NO, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO IT. IT STARTS TO RUST, THEY DON'T PAINT IT. THE MAINTENANCE GETS BAD AND THEN THEY JUST TURN IT OFF. TAKE A LOOK AT CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY HAVE WINDMILLS THAT HAVE BEEN THAT ARE ALL AND NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE THEM DOWN BECAUSE IT'S NOT A LOT OF PROFIT IN TAKING THEM DOWN. SO THEY'RE SITTING THERE ALL ROTTEN AND RUSTY, IT'S TERRIBLE. AND THEN I HEAR THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS LOVE THEM. WE GOT TO TALK TO THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS. AND THEY CANNOT YOU KNOW SOLAR, I LIKE SOLAR, BUT SOLAR IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER TO FIRE UP OUR MASSIVE PLANTS. WE HAVE BIG PLANTS, INCLUDING IN THIS GREAT STATE AND YOU CAN'T FIRE THEM UP WITH THIS STUFF. YOU CAN'T FIRE IT. WE NEED THE STRENGTH BECAUSE WE'RE COMPETING AGAINST A LOT OF NATIONS AND THEY DON'T GO THROUGH WHAT WE DO. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE AIR AND THEY SHOULD, AND THEY SHOULD, WHICH IS ANOTHER PROBLEM. I TOOK YOU OUT OF THAT CRAZY PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD, BECAUSE IT WAS A TOTAL DISASTER. NO, IT WAS A WAY OF HURTING THE UNITED STATES. I TELL YOU, WE WOULD HAVE HAD A CLOSE 20, 25% OF OUR FACTORIES IN ORDER TO EVEN IT WAS SO CRAZY, SO EXPENSIVE BUT I TOOK YOU OUT. I WAS SURPRISED PEOPLE, MOST PEOPLE, THEY APPRECIATE WHAT I DID. BECAUSE YOU THINK IT WAS EASY DOING THAT? IT WAS ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING. I GOT ONE DAY OF BAD PRESS, AFTER THAT, EVERYBODY FORGOT ABOUT IT. IT WASN'T THAT BAD. BUT I DID THE RIGHT THING FOR OUR COUNTRY AND WE WANT TO HAVE OUR GREAT PLANTS WORKING. WE WANT TO HAVE OUR GREAT PLANTS FIRED UP. THEY SAID MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE DEAD, RIGHT? SLEEPY JOE SAID, 'I'M GOING TO BRING BACK MANUFACTURING.' REALLY? WELL, OBAMA SAID, YOU'D NEED A MIRACLE TO BRING BACK MANUFACTURING. I BROUGHT BACK 650,000 JOBS. HE SAID YOU'D NEED A MIRACLE. AND NOW SLEEPY JOE IS SAYING THAT, NO, NO, NO. I'VE GOT TO BRING BACK ... HE'S NOT GOING TO BRING BACK ANYTHING. I MADE HISTORY BY SIGNING AN EXECUTIVE ORDER MAKING THE OFFICIAL POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TO BUY AMERICAN AND TO HIRE AMERICAN. NOW I DID THIS LONG TIME AGO. AND THEN I SEE A SIGN IN FRONT OF JOE RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE, IT SAID, BUY AMERICAN. OH GREAT, JOE, THANKS, JOE. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN FOR 47 YEARS? BECAUSE FOR 47 YEARS, JOE BIDEN DID THE OPPOSITE. HE CRUSHED THE DREAMS OF AMERICAN WORKERS AND ENRICHED FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THAT'S HOW CHINA HAPPENED. HEY, LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE. I'VE TAKEN BILLIONS, TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF CHINA. NOBODY ELSE DID IT BEFORE ME, I MEAN, NO OTHER PRESIDENT. IN ALL FAIRNESS, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO OBAMA AND BIDEN, I CALL HIM, OBIDEN BECAUSE IT'S EASIER, OBIDEN. IN ALL FAIRNESS TO OBIDEN, I MEAN, THEY DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT. BUT NOW I SEE BUY AMERICAN. HEY, HE ALSO COPIED ON THE PANDEMIC. DID YOU SEE HE COPIED EVERYTHING I WAS DOING? EXCEPT ONE THING, HE WOULDN'T HAVE CLOSED THE COUNTRY TO CHINA SO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DIED FROM THAT. BUT TWO MONTHS, TWO AND A HALF MONTHS LATER, HE ADMITTED THAT I WAS RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JOE, I APPRECIATE IT. AND YESTERDAY HE MADE, I THINK HE MADE A MISTAKE. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK, THE USMCA, WHAT'S BETTER THAT OR NAFTA? WELL, NO, THE USMCA IS BETTER. WAS THAT JAKE TAPPER? I LIKE JAKE TAPPER, WAS THAT ... I DON'T THINK HE WAS DOING ... I DON'T THINK HE LIKES ME TOO MUCH, BUT THAT'S OKAY. THEY SAID WHAT'S BETTER, THEY SAID, WHAT'S BETTER. HE GOES, 'USMCA. WELL, THAT'S THE DEAL THAT TRUMP MADE. OH, IT IS? OH.' THAT'S A GREAT DEAL WE MADE. WE TOOK THE HORRIBLE NAFTA DEAL. WE GOT RID OF THE NAFTA. WE GOT RID OF TPP. WE GOT RID OF THAT TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE SOUTH KOREA DEAL, WHICH HILLARY CLINTON SAID, WILL PRODUCE 250,000 JOBS. SHE SAID, THIS WILL PRODUCE 200 SHE MADE IT. HILLARY, CROOKED HILLARY. SHE MADE IT, NO WAIT, SHE SAID IT'S GOING TO PRODUCE 250,000 JOBS. AND SHE WAS 100% RIGHT, IT PRODUCED 250,000 JOBS FOR SOUTH KOREA, NOT FOR US. SOUTH KOREA DID VERY WELL WITH THAT DEAL, BUT I CHANGED THAT DEAL A LOT. THAT'S NOW A GOOD DEAL. EARLIER THIS YEAR, I KEPT MY PROMISE TO AMERICAN WORKERS. WHEN WE ENDED THE NAFTA NIGHTMARE AND SIGNED THE BRAND NEW USMCA MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT INTO LAW. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE COMPANIES LEAVING FOR MEXICO VERY MUCH ANYMORE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE LEAVING YOUR COMMUNITY, GOING TO MEXICO, MAKING A PRODUCT, SELLING THE PRODUCT BACK IN, NOT BEING TAXED AT THE BORDER. DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY ANYMORE. IT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST REASON I RAN FOR PRESIDENT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH, AND THESE STUPID, ENDLESS WARS. I SAVED THE BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WASHINGTON DOESN'T LIKE ME. THEY LOVE THOSE ENDLESS WARS. YOU GOT TO ASK THEM, 'WHY? ' DO YOU EVER WATCH WHERE THEY'RE VERY CRITICAL OF ME. I MEAN, 'WE DON'T LIKE HIM ON FOREIGN POLICY.' REALLY? LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE. LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE. ISRAEL WE'RE SIGNING DEALS ALL OVER THE PLACE. THESE GUYS THAT ARE LECTURING ALL THE TIME, THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE. THEY'RE CLUELESS. THEY WERE CLUELESS. THAT'S WHY FOR 40 YEARS YOU GOT NOTHING EXCEPT BLOOD IN THE SAND. THAT'S ALL YOU GOT. BLOOD IN THE SAND. I SAVED THE US AUTO INDUSTRY BY WITHDRAWING FROM LAST ADMINISTRATION'S JOB-KILLING TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. I TOOK THE TOUGHEST EVER ACTION TO STAND UP TO CHINA'S RAMPANT THEFT OF AMERICAN JOBS. THEY DON'T LIKE ME TOO MUCH. JOE BIDEN'S AGENDA IS, 'MADE IN CHINA'. MY AGENDA IS, 'MADE IN THE USA'. THAT'S THE WAY. FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS, I'VE BEEN DELIVERING FOR OUR INCREDIBLE HISPANIC I LOVE THE SPANISH COMMUNITY. OH, THERE WAS A POLL TODAY. DID YOU SEE IT? DID YOU SEE THE POLL? OH, THIS WAS A BIGGIE. THEY HAD A POLL TODAY THAT WITH THE HISPANIC VOTER, THEY CALL THEM LATINO, HISPANIC. THEY USE DIFFERENT TERMS. TO ME, I JUST LOVED THE PEOPLE. I DON'T CARE, BUT LET ME JUST DID YOU SEE IT? TRUMP IS LEADING BIDEN WITH THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. TRUMP IS LEADING BIDEN. WELL, HISPANICS LIKE TOUGH PEOPLE. THEY LIKE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO PRODUCE JOBS. THEY LIKE BY THE WAY, THE HISPANICS UNDERSTAND THE BORDER BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE. THEY'RE BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE. NO, BUT WE'RE BEING YOU KNOW, IT'S UNUSUAL THAT A REPUBLICAN WOULD BE LEADING A DEMOCRAT, NOT IT'S HABIT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, IT'S HABIT. BUT THE HISPANICS GET IT. AND WE'RE LEADING WITH THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAD THE LOWEST JOB NUMBERS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. YOU HAD THE BEST HOME OWNERSHIP. EVERY STATISTIC WAS THE BEST. AND NOW WE'RE DOING IT AGAIN, EXCEPT WE'RE DOING IT VERY RAPIDLY. REMEMBER 8.4%. WE COULD HAVE BEEN AT 44%, IF STUPID PEOPLE RAN IT, 8.4%. I'M FIGHTING FOR SCHOOL CHOICE, SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS, LOW TAXES AND REGULATIONS ON HISPANIC-OWNED, SMALL BUSINESSES. WE'RE FIGHTING. YOU KNOW, THE HISPANIC-OWNED, SMALL BUSINESSES, THEY'RE GREAT BUSINESS PEOPLE. I KNOW IT FROM BEING IN BUSINESS. THEY WERE VERY TOUGH. THEY WERE GREAT BUSINESS PEOPLE AND THEY GET IT. THEY GET IT LIKE VERY FEW PEOPLE GET IT. I'M ALSO STANDING UP FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. JOE BIDEN WOULD BE SO JOE BIDEN WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR ALL COMMUNITIES, NOT JUST THE HISPANIC COMMUNITIES, PLEDGED TO WAGE ATTACKS ON CATHOLIC ORGANIZATIONS, LIKE THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR THAT WE'RE HELPING. AND WE'RE WINNING WITH THEM. THEY GOT HIT SO HARD BY OH BIDEN. THEY GOT HIT SO HARD. I REMEMBER THEM IN THE SUPREME COURT, THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR. THEY GET HIT BY BIDEN. AND THEN HE SAYS, 'HOW WONDERFUL.' HE'S SUCH A WONDERFUL PERSON. HE SUPPORTS TAXPAYER-FUNDED, EXTREME, LATE-TERM ABORTION. AND I MEAN, NINTH MONTH, NINTH MONTH, NINTH MONTH. AND HE'D ALLOW VIOLENT MOBS TO BURN DOWN YOUR BUSINESS. AND HE WOULD HAND YOUR COUNTRY OVER TO THE SOCIALISTS. BUT I BELIEVE IT'S WORSE THAN SOCIALISTS. I DO. I THINK IT'S A STEP WORSE THAN SOCIALIST. AND IT STARTS WITH A C. THAT IS WHY WE'RE GOING TO WIN A RECORD SHARE OF THE HISPANIC VOTE IN NOVEMBER. SO IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT'S SO IMPORTANT. WE'RE BRINGING IT BACK VERY FAST. I THINK NEXT YEAR IS NEXT YEAR, I BELIEVE WILL BE AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN THE YEAR WE HAD LAST YEAR. UNLESS SOMEBODY COMES IN AND DECIDES TO QUADRUPLE YOUR TAXES, THEN I CAN'T. THEN ALL BETS ARE OFF, BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WE'RE LOWERING TAXES. HE'S RAISING TAXES. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TREMENDOUS GROWTH. JOE BIDEN'S PARTY CONTINUES TO ATTACK OUR INCREDIBLE BORDER AGENTS. THEY'RE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, MORE THAN HALF OF WHOM HAPPEN TO BE HISPANIC-AMERICANS. DID YOU KNOW THAT? I KNOW ALL OF THEM. 'JOSE, HOW YOU DOING? JUAN, HOW ARE YOU DOING? EVERY SIXTH TIME, I'D SAY HELLO, JIM, HOW ARE YOU? THESE EXTRAORDINARY PATRIOTS DESERVE OUR ADMIRATION, GRATITUDE AND RESPECT, NOT JOE BIDEN'S CONTEMPT. HE'S GOT CONTEMPT FOR THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE SO GREAT AND BRAVE. THAT'S A TOUGH JOB. MY ADMINISTRATION'S ACHIEVED THE MOST SECURE BORDER IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE ENDED THE CATCH AND RELEASE DISASTER. REMEMBER YOU'D CATCH SOMEBODY, 'WHAT'S YOUR NAME? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS? I DON'T KNOW. OK. GO INTO OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S OK. YOU COULDN'T ARREST ANYBODY. WE ENDED IT, STOPPED ASYLUM FRAUD AND WE'VE DEPORTED OVER 20,000 GANG MEMBERS, INCLUDING MS13 AND OVER A HALF A MILLION CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS. NOW THINK ABOUT IT. THINK OF THAT NUMBER. THINK IF YOU AT A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAT WERE CRIMINAL, ILLEGAL ALIENS. SOME OF THESE ARE VERY VIOLENT PEOPLE AND WE GET THEM THE HELL OUT. WE'RE STOPPING HUMAN TRAFFICKING, PROTECTING THE VICTIMS, MOST OF WHOM ARE WOMEN, MOST OF WHOM ARE WOMEN. HUMAN TRAFFICKING BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET THAT'S A TREMENDOUSLY BIG AND HORRIBLE BUSINESS. THESE ARE THE WORST HUMAN BEINGS OF ALL. BUT MOST OF THE VICTIMS ARE WOMEN, CHILDREN TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT, BUT WOMEN AND HUMAN TRAFFICKERS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT MADE IT THAT WAY IS THE INTERNET. WHO WOULD THINK? IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE AN ANCIENT CRIME. IT'S NOT. IT'S VERY MODERN BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET BECAUSE OF THE COMPUTER. AND IT'S A HORRIBLE THING AND WE'VE STOPPED SO MUCH OF IT. WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT GO AFTER THESE ANIMALS. AND WE BUILT NOW OVER 320 MILES OF BORDER WALL AND ARE ADDING 10 NEW MILES A WEEK. AND THE WALL WILL VERY SOON BE FINISHED. IT'LL BE FINISHED. WE'VE INVESTED $2.5 TRILLION IN THE U.S. MILITARY. WE'VE REBUILT OUR DEPLETED IT WAS A DEPLETED MILITARY. NOW WE HAVE THE NEWEST, WE HAVE THE BEST WE'VE EVER HAD AND LAUNCHED THE FIRST NEW BRANCH OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES IN NEARLY 75 YEARS, THE U.S. SPACE FORCE. AND WE DID THINGS THAT PEOPLE SAID COULDN'T BE DONE. AFTER 52 YEARS, WE PASSED VA CHOICE IN VA ACCOUNTABILITY AND 91% OF OUR VETERANS NOW APPROVE OF THEIR VA CARE. THEY THINK IT'S DOING GREAT. THE FACT IS I DID MORE IN 47 MONTHS AS PRESIDENT THAN JOE BIDEN DID IN 47 YEARS. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. I WITHDREW FROM LAST ADMINISTRATION'S DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. WE KILLED THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF ISIS, AL-BAGHDADI. WE ELIMINATED THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST AND MASS MURDERER OF AMERICAN TROOPS, QASEM SOLEIMANI. HE'S DEAD. HE'S GONE. BIDEN VOTED FOR THE IRAQ WAR. HE OPPOSED THE MISSION TO TAKE OUT OSAMA BIN LADEN. HE OPPOSED KILLING SOLEIMANI. HE OVERSAW THE RISE OF ISIS AND HE CHEERED THE RISE OF CHINA AS A VERY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT. OH, REALLY? TELL ME ABOUT IT. TELL ME ABOUT IT. NOT TOO POSITIVE. JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY FOR 47 YEARS. IN FACT, THE SECRETARY OF STATE, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE SAID ABOUT HIM, 'HE'S NEVER CALLED IT RIGHT. HE NEVER CALLED IT RIGHT.' IF WE HAD LISTENED TO JOE, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE AMERICANS WOULD RIGHT NOW HAVE DIED. WHEN THE VIRUS ARRIVED, WE LAUNCHED THE LARGEST NATIONAL MOBILIZATION SINCE WORLD WAR II. YOU KNOW THAT, ESPECIALLY WITH VENTILATORS AND EQUIPMENT AND MASKS AND SHIELDS. WE'RE DELIVERING LIFE-SAVING THERAPIES THAT HAVE ACHIEVED AMONG THE LOWEST CASE FATALITY RATES OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. AND YOU DON'T HEAR THAT FROM THE FAKE NEWS. EUROPE'S EXCESS MORTALITY RATE IS 24% HIGHER. AND THESE ARE STATISTICS THAT COME FROM PEOPLE THAT DO THIS STUFF, RIGHT? THIS IS NOT DONE BY MY SECRETARY. 24% HIGHER THAN THE UNITED STATES AND DESPITE THEIR PUNITIVE LOCKDOWNS, THEY'RE ONCE AGAIN SEEING A SPIKE. THEY'RE SEEING A BIG SPIKE IN CASES OVER THERE. THEY DID THE HEAVY LOCKDOWNS, JUST LIKE YOU'RE DOING RIGHT HERE. AND THEY'RE SEEING A SPIKE. AND THERE'S NO REASON FOR THAT. THE UNITED STATES HAS EXPERIENCED THE SMALLEST CONTRACTION OF ANY MAJOR WESTERN NATION. THINK OF THAT. AND BY FAR, THE FASTEST RECOVERY. AND IF THEY WROTE ABOUT IT PROPERLY, IT WOULD BE A PROPER THING, A PROPER THING TO DO. THROUGH OUR HISTORIC RELIEF PROGRAMS, WE'VE SAVED MORE THAN HALF A TRILLION NEVADA COPS AND JOBS AND ALL OF THIS YET. SO MANY PEOPLE GOING OUT. WE'VE SAVED 42,000 NEVADA BUSINESSES. THINK OF THAT. BIDEN WOULD TERMINATE THIS COMEBACK. HE WANTS TO END IT. HE WOULD TERMINATE THIS COMEBACK. HE WOULD PUT YOUR FAMILIES IN DANGER. HE WILL TOTALLY DESTROY SOCIAL SECURITY. AND IN MY OPINION, IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO TO MEDICARE, THEY WILL DESTROY SOCIAL SECURITY. THEY WILL. YOU CALLED IT. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? EXACTLY, RIGHT. HE'S GOING TO MASSIVELY RAISE YOUR TAXES. REIMPOSE CRIPPLING FEDERAL REGULATIONS, DESTROY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY AND DESTROY PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. HE'S GOING TO DESTROY THAT AND DECIMATE YOUR 401KS AND RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND STOCKS. YOUR STOCKS ARE GOING TO GO DOWN LIKE YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING GO DOWN BEFORE. HE'LL OBLITERATE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. HE'LL GIVE YOU AND HE WOULD, HE WOULD GIVE FREE HE WANTS TO GIVE FREE HEALTHCARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS THAT WILL BANKRUPT MEDICARE. HE WANTS TO GIVE YOU SAW HIM RAISE HIS HAND. REMEMBER THE DEBATE WHERE THEY'RE ALL STANDING THERE AND HE LOOKED AROUND, 'WHO'S GOING TO GIVE FREE HEALTHCARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS? AND EVERYONE'S RAISING HANDS. HE'S GOING, 'OH ' NOW TAKE A LOOK. I'M NOT KIDDING. IT'S SAD. IT'S PATHETIC. HE WOULD END OUR TRAVEL BANS ON JIHADIST REGIONS AND INCREASE REFUGEE ADMISSIONS 700%, OPENING THE FLOOD GATES TO TERROR-AFFLICTED NATIONS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. HE'LL ESTABLISH A NATIONAL SANCTUARY CITY POLICY FOR CRIMINAL, ILLEGAL ALIENS. HE LOVES SANCTUARY CITIES, MEANING THE PEOPLE THAT CONTROL HIM LOVE SANCTUARY CITIES. BIDEN, PLEDGES TO OPPOSE SCHOOL CHOICE. AND HE HAS STATED THAT IF HE IS ELECTED CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE GONE. THEY'RE GONE. IN THE SECOND TERM, AND WE'VE ALREADY STARTED IT VERY HEAVILY, I WILL PROVIDE SCHOOL CHOICE TO EVERY PARENT IN AMERICA. A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A VOTE FOR SAFE COMMUNITIES, GREAT JOBS AND A LIMITLESS FUTURE FOR ALL AMERICANS. INSTEAD OF LETTING WASHINGTON CHANGE US, DESPITE ALL THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH MORE THAN ANY PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN THROUGH WITH THESE CHARACTERS AND THEY'RE FALLING ONE AFTER ANOTHER. BUT YOU DO NOTICE THAT I HOPE. ONE AFTER ANOTHER. OH, I SEE THE PHONES HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT. I WONDER WHAT THAT'S ALL ABOUT, BUT THAT'S A CRIMINAL THING YOU DID. WE ARE CHANGING WASHINGTON. WE ARE CHANGING WASHINGTON. NEVER FORGET THAT THEY'RE COMING AFTER ME BECAUSE I AM FIGHTING FOR YOU. AND IT'S TRUE. OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, TO CONCLUDE, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA INTO THE MANUFACTURING SUPERPOWER OF THE WORLD. AND WE WILL END OUR RELIANCE ON CHINA ONCE AND FOR ALL. WE WILL MAKE OUR MEDICAL SUPPLIES RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE WILL RAPIDLY RETURN TO FULL EMPLOYMENT, SOARING ECONOMIES AND A RECORD PROSPERITY, EVEN GREATER THAN LAST YEAR. WE WILL HIRE MORE POLICE, INCREASE PENALTIES FOR ASSAULTS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT, SURGE FEDERAL PROSECUTORS INTO HIGH CRIME COMMUNITIES AND BAN SANCTUARY CITIES. WE WILL APPOINT PROSECUTORS, JUDGES, JUSTICES, AND BELIEVE WE WILL BELIEVE IN ENFORCING THE LAW. WE WANT LAW AND ORDER. WE HAVE TO HAVE IT. WE WILL ENSURE EQUAL JUSTICE FOR CITIZENS OF EVERY RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, AND CREED. WE WILL DEFEND THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE WILL UPHOLD RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, FREE SPEECH AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. WE WILL STRIKE DOWN TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN OUR CITIZENS AND WE WILL KEEP AMERICA OUT OF ENDLESS FOREIGN WARS. AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME AS WE SPEAK TONIGHT. WE WILL MAINTAIN AMERICA'S UNRIVALED MILITARY MIGHT AND WE WILL ENSURE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. WE WILL END SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING, REQUIRE PRICE TRANSPARENCY. IT'S ALREADY SIGNED, STARTS ON JANUARY 1ST. I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO I KNOW OURS IS A BIG DEAL. I DON'T WANT SLEEPY JOE TO TAKE CARE OF CAN YOU IMAGINE? I'LL BE WATCHING. 'PRICES HAVE DROPPED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF PRICE.' AND I'M THE ONE THAT GOT IT DONE. AND HE'LL SAY, 'WHAT DID I DO? WHAT DID I DO? HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?' AND WE'LL FURTHER REDUCE HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WE JUST DID FAVORED NATIONS. WE'RE GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE LOWEST PRICE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE DID A FAVORED NATIONS CLAUSE. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? WE WILL THE DRUG COMPANIES DON'T EXACTLY LIKE ME TOO MUCH. THEY'RE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEGATIVE COMMERCIALS. PLEASE UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU SEE THOSE COMMERCIALS, IT MEANS YOUR DRUG PRICES ARE COMING DOWN. WE WILL STRONGLY PROTECT MEDICAID AND SOCIAL SECURITY, WHICH THEY WILL GIVE UP. AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND AMERICA WILL LAND THE FIRST WOMAN ON THE MOON AND THE UNITED STATES WILL BE THE FIRST NATION TO LAND AN ASTRONAUT ON MARS. WE WILL STOP THE RADICAL INDOCTRINATION OF OUR STUDENTS AND RESTORE PATRIOTIC EDUCATION TO OUR SCHOOLS. AND WE WILL TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY AND ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. AND WE WILL LIVE BY THE TIMELESS WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, 'IN GOD WE TRUST.' FOR YEARS, YOU HAD A PRESIDENT WHO APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF NEVADA. SO VERY IMPORTANTLY, GET YOUR FRIENDS, GET YOUR FAMILY, GET YOUR NEIGHBORS, GET YOUR COWORKERS AND GET OUT AND VOTE ON NOVEMBER 3RD. FROM CARSON CITY TO ELKO, FROM LAS VEGAS TO RENO AND FROM CLARK COUNTY TO RIGHT HERE IN DOUGLAS COUNTY, WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF RED-BLOODED AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO POURED OUT THEIR HEART, SWEAT, AND SOUL TO SECURE OUR LIBERTY. THEY WANT TO SECURE OUR LIBERTY. THINK OF IT AND DEFEND OUR FREEDOM. NEVADA WAS FOUNDED BY PIONEERS AND PROSPECTORS, MINERS AND COWBOYS, INNOVATORS AND TRAILBLAZERS, TOUGH PEOPLE, GREAT PEOPLE WHO TAMED THE FRONTIER, RAISED UP THE MIGHTY HOOVER DAM, LIT UP THE BRILLIANT LIGHTS OF THE VEGAS STRIP AND TRANSFORMED A SPRAWLING DESERT INTO A SHINING OASIS. SO TRUE. OUR AMERICAN ANCESTORS MADE THIS INTO THE GREATEST NATION EVER TO EXIST ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. AND WE ARE MAKING IT GREATER THAN IT EVER HAS BEEN. WE ARE MAKING IT GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. WE ARE MAKING IT GREATER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN. PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WITH YOUR HELP, YOUR DEVOTION AND YOUR DRIVE, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING, AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. WE ARE ONE MOVEMENT, ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY, AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD.

         "Well, hello, Iowa. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you for that warm welcome. To Governor Kim Reynolds, to Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg. I'm also told we're joined by Iowa's former First Lady. Chris Branstad is with us today. Chris, take a bow, will you? (Applause.) Great to have you home. State Senate Majority Whip Amy Sinclair. And, of course, to Roger Hargens and the amazing men and women of Accumold, it is great to be back in the Hawkeye State. Thank you all for having us today. (Applause.) Thank you. Governor, thank you. And it's great to be here with some friends in public and private life who have been partnering with this administration to promote American manufacturing, to promote agriculture at home and abroad. And speaking of friends of mine, I was talking to a friend of mine this morning. I told him I was headed to Iowa and I thought he sounded just a little bit jealous. (Laughter.) So allow me to bring greetings and admiration from a man who loves the state of Iowa and who's been fighting every day to keep Iowa growing. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) Now, before I begin about the topic of the day, let me just take a moment to say a word about your governor. I want to thank Kim Reynolds for her outstanding leadership for this stat, but most especially for the way that she and your entire community of first responders stepped forward in the historic flooding this March. Governor, the nation was impressed, and you should be proud of the way Iowa responded to these historic floods. And we are going to stay with you every step of the way until these communities come all the way back. (Applause.) Thank you, Governor. Great job. You know, it is an honor for me to serve as your Vice President alongside a President who gets up every day and fights to keep the promises that he made to the people of Iowa. From our very first day in office, this President promised that we were going to get this economy growing again, that we were going to raise wages for working Americans, that we were going to revive the American economy. And that's just what we've done: 6 million new jobs created by businesses just like this one and unemployment is at a 50-year low. (Applause.) But you know, I hail from the Hoosier State , an awful lot like Iowa. And in Iowa and Indiana, the truth is, we do two things particularly well: We make things and we grow things. And this President has a real heart for manufacturing. In fact, President Trump has been working hard to revive American manufacturing since the first day of this administration. And with the strong support of our partners in the Congress, in two and a half years we've been doing just that. You know, this President has already signed more laws rolling back federal red tape on businesses just like this one than any administration in American history. We've unleashed American energy. And this President signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. We cut taxes for working families, for family farmers, and we cut taxes for businesses large and small so companies just like Accumold can compete and win against companies anywhere in the world. (Applause.) And the results have been remarkable. Since Election Day 2016, as I mentioned, we've created millions of new jobs all across this country, including, I'm proud to report, 49,000 new jobs right here in the state of Iowa. Well done, Iowa business. (Applause.) I mentioned the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low. And, here in Iowa, it is an astonishing 2.4 percent. And most important of all, I know, to this President, to our administration, and to your governor, is that after years where wages seemed just stuck in up to the axle and not growing at the pace that America has needed to keep ahead and to get ahead, now wages are rising at the fastest pace in nearly 10 years. And most exciting of all, wages are rising the most rapidly among blue-collar, hardworking Americans. The way we put it: The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. (Applause.) This economy is working for everybody. It's true. And when it comes to manufacturing: Since Election Day 2016, manufacturing companies across this country have created more than 500,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs like you have right here at Accumold, including 15,000 manufacturing jobs right here in the Hawkeye State. You know, 2018 was actually the best year for manufacturing job creation in more than 20 years. And, frankly, it's a credit to people like all of you who make companies like this work each and every day. Businesses are investing and growing here in Iowa and around America because of your work ethic, because of your professionalism. And you're to be commended. It is remarkable to think of the stories of American businesses just like this one. The story of Accumold is one worth telling. This is a company that started in a rented garage, I'm told. It was a rented garage. It wasn't even your garage. (Laughter.) In those early days, that little room, the founders of this company came up with a new way of manufacturing small, complex component parts for high-tech industries , medical devices and electronics. Thirty-five years later, Accumold, from those humble beginnings, now employs 350 people right here in Iowa. It's another great American story of success and innovation. Congratulations. (Applause.) But I know from talking to Roger, he understands that the success of Accumold is only made possible because of its people , each and every one of you , like a couple people that I want to mention today: a man who has served in the Army Reserves for 15 years, who has used his skills to serve his country in Afghanistan as an aircraft electrician. And now he's using those very same skills here to build up this company and build up Iowa's economy. Would you join me in showing our appreciation, for his service and his professionalism, to Jeff Hancock? Jeff, where are you? (Applause.) Thanks, Jeff. And thanks for your service. Another man who was born in Mexico and moved to Iowa when he was 10 years old is with us today. He attended Des Moines Area Community College on a scholarship and then joined the team here at Accumold, I'm told, about four years ago. He just got married , (laughter) , and in just the last two months, he became a father. And together with his brother Francisco, he works here at Accumold. And he just became an American citizen. Would you join me in congratulating a new dad, a new American: Yanni and Francisco Sanchez. Where are you? (Applause.) You know, these folks are just emblematic of, really, all of you in this room. I mean, truthfully, we're renewing American manufacturing because of all of you , because of your worth ethic, your integrity, and your hard work. And because of who you are, companies like Accumold are thriving all over Iowa and all over America. So give yourselves a round of applause. This is your success story. Great job. (Applause.) So I came here today to express the admiration of the President and our administration for this great company and for the success that you've enjoyed here because of all your hard work. But I also came here today to ask for your help. Because for all the progress that we've made , all the jobs that have been created in manufacturing and in every area across Iowa , the truth is that that's just what this businessman-turned-President calls a 'good start.' To keep the American economy moving, President Trump and I know not only do we have to roll back red tape and cut taxes, unleash American energy, but we've got to have trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. And that's what the USMCA is all about. (Applause.) It's true. It's true. From the very outset of this administration, with dealing with Europe or the Indo-Pacific, we've been working to negotiate deals that are promoting free, fair, and, as the President likes to say, reciprocal trade , where we say to our trading partners around the world that we'll deal with you in the same way that you deal with us. For too long, the United States had one-sided trade agreements. Countries were able to manufacture goods or grow products and ship them into the United States with very few limitations, when nevertheless we faced barriers and tariffs as we tried to export to their countries. And we've made progress around the world in opening up markets to manufactured goods and our agricultural products that are made and grown here in Iowa. But I came here to Iowa to send one message , one message and one message only , today: Iowa and America need the Congress of the United States to pass the largest trade deal in American history. The time has come for Congress to pass the USMCA. (Applause.) It'd mean a lot. It would mean a lot to the Iowa economy and a lot of businesses just like this one. I've been traveling all over the country talking about the USMCA over the last several months. You know, in , according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA is actually going to add more than 175,000 jobs to our economy once it puts into effect. Sixty-eight billion dollars to our economy just in the initial estimates. And that includes nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs that we expect to be created right out of the gate. And that same estimate tells us that the USMCA will increase wages for American manufacturing workers. This job is a win for American workers, and Congress needs to pass it to the President's desk. (Applause.) Now, the governor and I were chatting on the plane on the way here, and she told us that Iowa exports about $12 billion in goods around the world, and half of that is exported to Mexico and Canada. And it's really amazing. And under the USMCA, I promise you, Iowa, that's only going to grow. It's going to create more jobs, more opportunity, and more prosperity right here in Iowa as we open up opportunities to expand new technologies, to expand agricultural products to Canada and Mexico. It's amazing to think that one out of every eight Iowa jobs depends on exports. And that's not news to me because I , as I said, I come from the Hoosier State, where our economy is , it shares very much the same traditions as you have here in Iowa. What you make here, what you grow here, you send to the world. But as I mentioned, nearly 50 percent of all Iowa exports go to Mexico and Canada, including 50 percent of all agricultural goods and 50 percent of all manufacturing goods. If we pass the USMCA, Iowa's workers and farmers are going to win like never before. But we got to get it done. The clock is ticking. For Iowa and America, Congress needs to approve the USMCA, and Congress needs to approve the USMCA this year. 2019 is when we have to get it done. (Applause.) And I watched this President drive a hard bargain, and I was in on a lot of those calls and a lot of those meetings with Mexico and with Canada. I mean, those of you that know a little bit about dairy know that Canada had set into motion some policies that were working a real disadvantage to American dairy. And I wish you could have been there. I wish you could have been a fly on the wall to watch the way this President fought and demanded that we level the playing field for agriculture and particularly for dairy, when it came to Canada. But the truth is, the President and our team have done our jobs. It's time for Congress to do their job. And so I'm going to ask you to do us a favor here. I want you to talk, here in Iowa, about what the USMCA is going to mean to companies just like this. I mean, talk to Roger. Talk to folks in this company about the incredible technology that you build here and already send around the world, and the impact that this trade agreement is going to have , and not just on our exports to Canada and to Mexico. But truthfully, when we pass the largest trade deal in American history, it's also going to be the most modern trade deal in American history. And as our negotiations continue to move forward with Japan for a free trade agreement; with the EU; with the UK, after Brexit is done; and most especially with China , make no mistake about it: The USMCA is going to provide a framework for the kind of trade deal that's going to put American jobs and American workers first in the 21st century. So I want you to go out and tell the story. I mean, you can just say, 'Hey, I went to work the other day and I ran into Mike' , (laughter) , 'and he said he flew all the way to Iowa because he's just really excited about the USMCA. And he told us it's going to make it possible for this company to keep growing, for this community to keep growing, and to keep doing all the kind of things that Accumold does every day way outside these walls.' You know, this is a great company. It's not only got a great success story, but Roger Hargens, the whole team here , Accumold is a great corporate citizen that supports causes all across this community and all across Iowa. And that only becomes more possible as the company continues to grow. So talk to your neighbors and friends. Let your voice be heard. And I think we'll get USMCA done, and we'll get it done this year. Now, I encourage you to reach out to elected officials in the House of Representatives who represent you here from Iowa, in particular. But let me say with some gratitude, you don't need to call Senator Chuck Grassley or Senator Joni Ernst because they are already leading the charge for the USMCA in the United States Senate. (Applause.) They are great leaders and we're grateful to both of them. But call your congressman, and tell him, 'Hey, I work at a great company , a company that makes the most incredible, high-tech medical devices the world has ever seen. And this is going to expand opportunities in our company to continue to grow, continue to create jobs, and continue to raise wages.' I'd also say to you, since I'm in Iowa, I understand that a lot of candidates are making their way through Iowa these days. (Laughter.) You know? I mean, it's that time of year, isn't it? And Iowa is that first-in-the-nation state. Let me tell you, I think , I know the people of Iowa take that responsibility to heart. But I hope you also take it as an opportunity. Because, right now, you deserve to know that every single Democrat running for President is opposed to the USMCA. So, Iowa, you should let your voice be heard with the people that are coming to visit this state. You should remind these candidates for the highest office in the land that 50 percent of all exports from Iowa go to Mexico and Canada. Remind them that this trade deal has the strongest protections not just for jobs but for American workers and for the environment in the history of trade deals. Tell them that Iowa needs the USMCA and they need to get behind the USMCA now. Iowa needs it. America needs it. Tell them it's time to get it done this year. (Applause.) We've got a great opportunity. I know you've got a great opportunity, Iowa, and I know you're not bashful around here. So let them know how you feel. It'll make a difference. Don't doubt it for a second. And finally, just let your voice be heard in the public debate. I mean, a letter to the editor, going on social media, call a local talk show , just talk to them about , about what this really means. Because the truth of the matter is, this is ultimately going to be driven by the American people. And if the American people from here in Iowa and all across this country will send a clear message to Capitol Hill that we want Congress to get it done, Congress will get the USMCA done and they'll get it done this year. So let your voice be heard, Iowa, in every way possible. It'll make a difference. (Applause.) So thanks for coming out today. I want to thank , I want to thank Roger. I want to thank the whole team here at Accumold for such a warm, wonderful welcome. I want to thank your great governor for the job that she's doing for the people of Iowa every day and all the other officials who are here. And I look forward to meeting as many of you as time permits before they whisk me away back to Washington, D.C. But let me just leave here with a promise to each one of you. I promise you we're going to continue to work our hearts out to bring this USMCA across the finish line. It's going to make a real difference for Iowa, and it's going to make a real difference for America. And there'll be plenty of credit to go around. The truth is, the President and I have been reaching across the aisle to Democrats in the House and the Senate. And I'm glad to report that many Democrats have already come out. Many Democrats have already come out with their support for this trade agreement. The truth is, we all need to weigh in. And there'll be plenty of credit to go around. And it'll be a win not for one party; it'll be a win for America when the USMCA gets done. And I'm just going to leave here and promise you that we're going to work hard on that. We're going to keep fighting for all the policies that Iowa voted to advance in that election back in 2016. We're going to keep working to make this economy more prosperous again. We're going to keep working to make Iowa safer than ever before. We're going to keep working so companies like Accumold can reach heights that they never even imagined. And I just am confident that, with President Donald Trump in the White House, with great leadership at the state level like Governor Kim Reynolds, with hardworking Americans like you at great companies like this, and with God's help, we're going to keep making America great again. Thanks, everybody. God bless you. God bless Iowa. And God bless America. (Applause.)",

AFTER YEARS OF WAITING, MANY, MANY YEARS, MANY, MANY DECADES, THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS TO ME GET IT DONE AND WE'VE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME. AND NANCY PELOSI TO ANNOUNCE U.S. MCA AND SHE DID IT ON THE SAME DAY THAT THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO MILES PER HOUR. THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT. AND THE REASON THEY ANNOUNCED IT ON THE SAME DAY, ONE HOUR LATER, THEY ANNOUNCED IMPEACHMENT WITH A FEW GUYS STANDING BEHIND HER. THEY ANNOUNCED IMPEACHMENT, THEN AN HOUR LATER SHE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE IS GOING TO DO USMCA. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY, IT'S A HUGE DEAL AND IT PLAYS OUT IMPEACHMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE EMBARRASSED BY THE IMPEACHMENT. AND OUR POLL NUMBERS HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ROOF BECAUSE OF HER STUPID IMPEACHMENT. AND THINK OF IT THIS WAY ALSO, THE SILVERLINING OF IMPEACHMENT AND THIS WITCHHUNT, THAT'S THE REASON THEY APPROVED USMCA, SO THAT'S OKAY WITH ME. BECAUSE THEY APPROVED IT AND THEY ARE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE IT. BUT HONESTLY IT'S AN INCREDIBLE DEAL FOR OUR COUNTRY. IT TOOK TOO LONG, IT WAITED IN CONGRESS FOR TOO LONG OF A TIME. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE DEAL AND REPLACING THE WORST, NAFTA. WE HAVE ALSO JUST REACHED A DEAL WITH CONGRESS TO INVEST A RECORD $738 BILLION MORE INTO OUR GREAT MILITARY. WHEN I TOOK OFFICE, I WILL TELL YOU I BECAME PRESIDENT, THINK OF IT ALMOST THREE YEARS AGO. WAS NOT THE MOST EXCITING NIGHT EVER? YOU KNOW, I AM JUST WATCHING THESE PEOPLE, THAT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISIONS FROM A RATING STANDPOINT, FROM AN EXCITING STANDPOINT, WHAT IN THE HELL WOULD THEY NOT DO WITHOUT ME AND YOU. YOU KNOW, ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE I RAN, I PICKED UP A NEW YORK TIMES AND IT WAS LIKE A LEAF LET YOU OUT AT THE GROCERY STORE. AND NOW IT IS THICK. THEY HAVE ALL OF THEIR REPORTERS COVERING TRUMP, TRUNK, TRUMP. I CAN'T IMAGINE THEY WOULDN'T ENDORSE ME BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T ENDORSE ME AND I DON'T WIN, THEY ARE ALL GOING DOWN THE TUBES. NEW YORK TIMES, WASHINGTON POST POST, THERE ARE SOME VERY DISHONEST NETWORKS. VERY, VERY DISHONEST. THEY ARE VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE. AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS, I ALWAYS HAVE TO SAY THIS. YOU HAVE SOME REALLY GREAT JOURNALISTS AND YOU HAVE SOME HONEST PUBLICATIONS, BUT NOT TOO MANY OF THEM I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. THE LEGISLATORS, WILL YOU KNOW THAT. DOES ANYBODY THINK THE MEDIAS HONEST? DOES ANYBODY THINK THEY ARE TOTALLY CORRUPT AND DISHONEST? ALL RIGHT, THE LEGISLATION ALSO OFFICIALLY ESTABLISH SOMETHING THAT SO IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE IT'S WHERE IT'S AT. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE USED TO SMILE AND NOW OUTSIDE OF THE WALL WHICH WE ARE BUILDING. YOU KNOW THE WALL IS GOING UP. IT GETS ONE OF THE BIGGEST APPLAUSE OF ANYTHING, IT'S THIS SIXTH BRANCH OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES, SPACE FORCE. WE ARE OPENING UP SPACE FORCE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT. AND EVERYTHING IS BUILT RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. AND BY THE WAY, WE BUILD THE GREATEST WEAPONS, THE GREATEST PLANES, THE GREATEST SHIPS, WE BUILD IT IN THE UNITED STATES. THERE IS NOBODY WHO COMES CLOSE. WE HAVE THE GREATEST MILITARY EQUIPMENT THAN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. ROCKETS, MISSILES, NO PLACE BUILD IT LIKE US WE ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD AND WE SELL IT TO ALLIES. AND THEY ALL WENT TO BUY FROM THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE SO HOT. WE ARE SO HOT. AND JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THE UNITED STATES SPECIAL FORCES BROUGHT THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST TO JUSTICE. THANKS TO THE STRENGTH ENCOURAGE OF OUR WARRIORS AND THEY ARE GREAT WARRIORS, THE BLOOD THIRSTY SAVAGE KNOWN AS AL BAGHDADI IS NOW DEAD. USA. USA. USA. AND HE WAS QUICKLY REPLACED BY HIS SECOND IN COMMAND. AND HIS SECOND-IN-COMMAND IS NOW DEAD. AND WE'VE GOT RI, AND OUR SIGHTS ON THE THIRD ALSO. WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE AND WHEN, BUT YOU KNOW IT'S BECOMING A VERY UNPOPULAR JOB. NOT A LOT OF TAKERS AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. GO BACK TO LIVING A GOOD NORMAL LIFE. BECAUSE AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN LIKE NEVER BEFORE. AND AS I ALWAYS SAY AND I'VE ALREADY SAID IT TWICE TONIGHT, THIS COUNTRY IS SO RESPECTED. AND WE WERE NOT RESPECTED FOR YEARS AGO. WE WERE LAUGHED AT. BUT WHILE WE ARE DELIVERING HISTORIC VICTORIES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS AND THE FAILED WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT ARE TRYING TO ERASE YOUR VOTES, NULLIFY THE ELECTION, AND OVERTHROW OUR DEMOCRACY. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I WOULD LOSE TOO MUCH SLEEP OVER. AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS. THE REPUBLICANS, AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF GREAT ONES HERE TONIGHT, YOUR CONGRESSMAN. YOU HAVE A LOT OF GREAT ONES THESE CONGRESSMEN ARE GREAT. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE NEVER BEEN SO UNITED AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW, EVER. THE HOUSE, THE SENATE, WE'VE NEVER BEEN THIS UNITED BECAUSE IT'S ALL A HOAX. AND THEY UNDERSTAND THAT. THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND POLL NUMBERS, BUT I'M SURE THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. BUT THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS ABOUT OVERTURNING YOUR GREAT 2,016 VOTES. OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE TRYING TO WIN THE 2,020 ELECTION. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. YESTERDAY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S, INSPECTOR GENERAL RELEASED A REPORT DETAILING THE OUTRAGEOUS, SCANDALOUS, AND UNPRECEDENTED ABUSES OF POWER. GET HER OUT. GET HER OUT. THESE GUYS WANT TO BE SO POLITICALLY CORRECT, YES GET HER OUT. SEE THAT? I'LL TELL YOU LAW-ENFORCEMENT IS SO GREAT. THAT PARTICULAR GUY WANTED TO BE SO POLITICALLY CORRECT ZERO WE DON'T WANT TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT. I DON'T KNOW WHO HE WAS, HE DID NOT DO THE GREATEST JOB. SO THEY TRIED TO FRAME INNOCENT PEOPLE IN THE LUDICROUS IT ALL STARTED WITH THE RUSH OF WITCHHUNT, RIGHT? THEN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL SCHOCKEN REPORT APPROVES THAT THE OBAMA FBI OBTAINED SECRET WARRANT TO SPY ON MY CAMPAIGN BASED ON A PHONY FOREIGN DOSSIER PAID FOR BY CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON. THE FBI FAILED TO DISCLOSE THE NATURE OF THE POLITICAL JOB TO THE PFIZER COURT. THEY HIT IT, THEY DECEIVED IT, AND THEY LIED. THE DOSSIER WAS WRITTEN BY A DISCREDITED DISCREDITED FOREIGN AGENT WHO QUOTE DESPERATE THAT DONALD TRUMP NOT GET ELECTED AND WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT HIM NOT BEING UNITED STATES PRESIDENT. WHAT'S THIS? THEY SPIED ON OUR CAMPAIGN, OKAY? THEY SPIED. NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND WE ARE REALLY WISE TO IT. WE ARE WISE TO IT. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FILED THAT THEY FBI'S SPIED APPLICATION CONTAINS 17 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS COMMONLY KNOWN AS LIES AND DECEIT. WHEN THE FBI, AND THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE IN THE FBI BUT NOT IN LEADERSHIP. THEY ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE AND LEADERSHIP. YOU HAVEN'T HAD. WHEN THE FBI UNCOVERED EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT WE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG, WHICH WAS RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING, THEY HID THAT EXONERATING, THEY HID IT YOU KNOW THAT, THEY HIT IT SO NOBODY COULD SEE IT AND THEY COULD KEEP THIS HEX HOAX GOING ON FOR TWO MORE YEARS. THEY KNEW RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING THAT IT WAS ALL A FRAME UP. A SET UP. BUT THEY HID IT SO NOBODY COULD SEE IT. SO THEY COULD KEEP IT GOING ON. THINKING THEY WERE GOING TO HURT US POLITICALLY. BUT NOW WE ARE STRONGER POLITICALLY THAN WE EVER WERE BEFORE. AND THE FBI ALSO SENT TO MULTIPLE UNDERCOVER HUMAN SPIES TO SURVEILLANCE RECORD PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CAMPAIGN. LOOK HOW THEY HAVE HURT PEOPLE. THEY HAVE DESTROYED THE LIVES OF PEOPLE THAT WERE GREAT PEOPLE. THEY ARE STILL GREAT PEOPLE, THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY SCUM. OKAY, BY SCUM. AN FBI LAWYER FORGED, FORAGED AN E-MAIL USED AS EVIDENCE. IT'S AN ACT WHICH IS NOW THE SUBJECT OF A CRIMINAL REFERRAL. OKAY. WHAT THEY DID IS SO UNBELIEVABLE , I LOOK FORWARD I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW, I LOOK FORWARD TO BULL DURHAM'S REPORTS, THAT'S THE ONE I LOOK FORWARD TO. AND THIS REPORT WAS GREAT BY THE IG, ESPECIALLY SINCE HE WAS APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA. CONSIDERING THAT FACT, IT WAS GREAT. BECAUSE WE LEARNED A LOT OF THINGS THAT NOBODY WOULD'VE FOUND OUT ALTHOUGH I SUSPECT WE WOULD HAVE. WE ALSO KNOW FROM A PREVIOUS INSPECTOR GENERAL INVESTIGATION THAT MANY OF THESE SAME HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS WERE CONSUMED WITH ANTI- TRUMP AND ANTI- TRUMP PEOPLE HATRED AND BIAS TEXTING ABOUT AN INSURANCE POLICY. REMEMBER? PETER STRZOK AND HIS LOVER LISA PAGE, REMEMBER? LISA I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, LISA PLEASE LISA. LISA I HAVE NEVER LOVED ANYONE LIKE YOU WE WON'T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. LISA PLEASE TELL ME YOU LOVELY LISA, I LOVE YOU. PETER I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU LIKE I'VE NEVER LOVED ANYONE. AND IF FOR ANY REASON, IF FOR ANY REASON SHE LOSES EVEN THOUGH SHE'S A STONE COLD CORRUPT PERSON. IF HER ANY REASON SHE LOSES, PETER, WE'VE GOT TO HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY WE HAVE TO DO. BECAUSE WERE GOING AFTER AND THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEAR. IT WAS THERE PHONY INSURANCE POLICY. SO FBI LAWYER LISA PAGE WAS SO IN LOVE SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. IT TEXTED THE HEAD OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PETER STRZOK, LIKEWISE SO IN LOVE. THIS POOR GUY, DID I HEAR HE NEEDED A RESTRAINING ORDER AFTER THIS WHOLE THING TO KEEP HIM AWAY FROM LISA? THAT'S WHAT I HEARD. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TRUE, THE FAKE NEWS WILL NEVER REPORTED BUT IT COULD BE TRUE. NOW THAT'S WHAT I HEARD, I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN WHO COULD BELIEVE A THING LIKE THAT? NO I HEARD PETER SCHROCK NEEDED A RESTRAINING ORDER TO KEEP HIM AWAY FROM HIS ONCE LOVER. LISA I HOPE YOUR MISSING. LISA HE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. BUT HE SAID HE'S NOT EVER GOING TO BECOME PRESIDENT AND STRUCK LOOKS BACK, NO NO HE WON'T, WE'LL STOP IT WE WILL STOP IT. CAN YOU BELIEVE WE FOUND THESE TEXTS? THESE ARE FBI AGENTS AT A HIGH LEVEL. NO NO. IT, THEY ARE GOOD TO STOP US FROM WINNING AN ELECTION. AND THEN WE HAVE TO LISTEN THAT THERE WAS NO BIAS. THINK OF THESE PEOPLE, THEY RIGHT THERE WAS NO BIAS. AND YET HE SAYING NO NO, DARLING, WILL STOP IT. AND THEN HE ANNOUNCED THERE IS NO BIAS. NO, WERE DONE AND IT'S NOT EASY AND SOMEBODY SAID A REGULAR PRESIDENT, I DON'T WANT TO USE NORMAL, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A NICE NORMAL THING. A REGULAR PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER A TABLE, SOME IN THE MOUTH, SAYING TAKE ME HOME MOMMY THIS IS TOO TOUGH FOR ME. TRUE, THEY KNOW. AND WHILE IT WAS TOUGH FOR MY FAMILY, I HAVE TO SAY VERY UNFAIR TO MY FAMILY VERY TOUGH ON MY FAMILY. I'VE A GREAT FAMILY. FOR ME IT'S MY LIFE I DO IT AND THAT'S ONE THING. BUT IT'S VERY TOUGH ON THE FAMILY. I THINK LIKE THIS HAPPENS IT'S A DISGRACE. BUT DAY AFTER DAY WE ARE EXPOSING SOMETHING CALLED THAT FILTHY DISGUSTING HORRIBLE SWAMP AND WERE CLEANING IT UP. AND NOW AFTER TWO AND A HALF YEARS, NOW THAT THE RUSSIA WITCHHUNT IS DEAD, A BIG FAT DISGUSTING FRAUD. THE CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING THE IMPEACHMENT WITCHHUNT HAVING TO DO WITH UKRAINE. BUT THAT'S ALREADY FAILING, YOU SAW THEIR SO-CALLED ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT TODAY. PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY ARE NOT EVEN DOING A CRIME. WHAT HAPPENED? ALL OF THESE HORRIBLE THINGS. BRIBERY AND THIS AND THAT, WHERE ARE THEY? THEY SAID THESE TWO THINGS THAT ARE NOT EVEN A CRIME. THIS IS THE LIGHTEST, WEAKEST IMPEACHMENT. OUR COUNTRY HAS HAD MANY IMPEACHMENTS. BUT IT WAS ON TODAY EVERYBODY SAID THIS IS IMPEACHMENT LIKE. THIS IS THE LIGHTEST IMPEACHMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY BY FAR. IT'S NOT EVEN LIKE AN IMPEACHMENT. THESE PEOPLE ARE STONE COLD CRICKET. WHEN A GUY WHEN LIKE SHIFTY SHIFT, THERE IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN. HE MADE UP MY STATEMENTS BECAUSE YOU SEE I DID ONE THING VERY GOOD, AS SOON AS I HEARD ABOUT THIS DEAL I RELEASED MY STATEMENT IMMEDIATELY. BUT HE HAD ALREADY MADE HORRIBLE STATEMENTS, AND BY THE WAY THE WHISTLEBLOWER? THE WHISTLEBLOWER DEFRAUDED OUR COUNTRY. BECAUSE THE WHISTLEBLOWER WROTE SOMETHING THAT WAS TOTALLY UNTRUE AND WE BROKE UP THE GAME. REMEMBER THIS SECOND WHISTLEBLOWER WAS COMING. AND THEN THE INFORMER, WHO WAS THE INFORMER? I KNOW WHO THE INFORMER WAS. SO THE INFORMER, OBVIOUSLY GAVE THEM FALSE INFORMATION. BECAUSE THEY WROTE IN THE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT RIGHT? THEY WROTE SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I SAID. WHAT I SAID WAS PERFECT, BUT THEY SCREWED UP THE WHOLE WORKS BECAUSE THOSE GUYS WEREN'T THERE. THEY DON'T KNOW WE HAD IT PROFESSIONALLY TRANSCRIBED, WORD FOR WORD TRANSCRIBED, SO BEAUTIFUL. AND MY LUCKY I HAD IT TRANSCRIBED. THINK OF THAT. THINK OF THAT. SO WHAT I SAID AND RELEASED IT, AND I DON'T LIKE DOING THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE RELEASING IT'S A CONVERSATION WITH A FOREIGN LEADER. AND THIS CASE A VERY FINE GENTLEMAN, THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE, THE NEW PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE. AND WE CALL THEM UP AND WE SAID, OUR SECRETARY OF STATE MADE THIS CALL IN AND ASKED IF IT WOULD BE OKAY. AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT THEY SAID YES THAT'S OKAY. AND BY THE WAY, HE IS FOREIGN MINISTER, EVERYBODY THEY SAID THERE WAS NO PRESSURE, HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, THERE IS NO PRESSURE. BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP ANYBODY. BUT WE RELEASED TO THE CONVERSATION AND THAT GUNNED IT UP. NOW ALL THE SUDDEN WE NEVER HEARD FROM THE SECOND WHISTLEBLOWER. WE NEVER HEARD WHO THE INFORMER WAS. THE WHISTLEBLOWER WHO IS GOING TO COME OUT STRONG, HE HAS DISAPPEARED. WHERE'S THE WHISTLEBLOWER? HE HAS DISAPPEARED. HE IS GONE. MAYBE OUR GREAT CONGRESSMEN CAN FIGHT HIM, OKAY? BUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER IS GONE, HE FLEW THE COOP BECAUSE HE REPORTED INCORRECTLY. AND THE IG WHO DID NOT WANT TO LOOK AT THE CONVERSATION, HE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO TURN THE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT OVER TO CONGRESS SO CONGRESS COULD HAVE FUN WITH IT, OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF. BUT TODAY THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS ANNOUNCE THESE TWO FLIMSY, PATHETIC, RIDICULOUS ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS, ARE WALKING BACK FROM EVERYTHING THEY CLAIM WITH TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT, THEY ARE NOW ADMITTING THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. THERE WAS NO OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. AND THERE WERE NO CRIMES WHATSOEVER. IT SAYS IT RIGHT THERE THERE ARE NO CRIMES. THEY ARE IMPEACHING ME AND THERE ARE NO CRIMES. THIS HAS TO BE A FIRST IN HISTORY. THEY ARE IMPEACHING ME BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY? THEY WANT TO WIN AN ELECTION AND IT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN DO IT. SO THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NOTHING. AND THEY HAVE TURNED THE SOMBER PROSPECT OF IMPEACHMENT, AND IT WAS TO ME A VERY UGLY WORD. IT'S A WORD I ASSOCIATE WITH SOME VERY BAD TIMES IN OUR COUNTRY. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE ARE HAVING THE BEST TIMES IN HISTORY IN OUR COUNTRY. BUT THE WORD IMPEACHMENT TO ME, IS A VERY, VERY UGLY WORD. IT'S A DARK UGLY WORD. BUT, BUT, I HAVE TO TELL YOU AS BAD AS THIS IS, IT MEANT SOMETHING. WHEN YOU HAD SERIOUS, HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS. WHEN YOU HAD A HIGH CRIMES, ITS IMPEACHMENT THAT WOULD HAPPEN EVERY 50 YEARS, EVERY 40 YEARS, EVERY HUNDRED YEARS. THIS WAS A BIG DEAL. THEY ARE MAKING IT SO LIGHT LET'S DO IT EVERY SIX MONTHS? THEY'VE CHEAPENED THE PROCESS, THEY'VE CHEAPENED THE PROCESS, THESE PEOPLE ARE SO BAD, THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS. AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT PELOSI, BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY. BY THE WAY SHE IS HAS TOTALLY LOST CONTROL. SHE HAS TOTALLY IT'S BEING RUN NOW BY THIS CRAZY AOC PLUS THREE. NOW IT'S BEING RUN BY OTHER PEOPLE. THE FAR LEFT HAS GRABS THAT PARTY, IT'S SO SAD TO SEE. AND SHE KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. I DIDN'T BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THE POLLS WILL GO THROUGH THE ROOF. THEY WENT UP TODAY IN MICHIGAN, AND WISCONSIN, IN A PLACE CALLED PENNSYLVANIA. THE POLLS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. THE SWING STATES, WE WON PENNSYLVANIA THE LAST TIME AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN IT AGAIN EVEN BIGGER. ARE POLLS HAVE GONE OVER THE LAST MONTH, THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE ROOF. YOU LOOK AT IT, TAKE A LOOK AT IT CAME OUT TODAY. THE FIREHOUSE POLE, THE FIREHOUSE POLE IS AN IMPORTANT POLE. I'VE NEVER LOOKED AT IT BUT TODAY I LIKE IT A LOT. NOBODY CAN EVEN BELIEVE IT. SO WHAT PELOSI DID, AS I SAID, THEY DO THE IMPEACHMENT AND THEN RIGHT AWAY LET'S DO U.S. EMA. YOU THINK SHE'D WAIT A DAY. SHE WANTED TO SMOTHER THE IMPEACHMENT CRAB. AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT SHE DID AT LEAST TO AN EXTENT. BUT EMMY DEN EMMY ANY DEMOCRAT WHO VOTES FOR THIS SHAM WILL VOTE TO SACRIFICE THE HOUSE MAJORITY, THEIR DIGNITY, AND THEIR CAREER. AND SOME OF THESE PARTISAN LUNATICS HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT IF THEY FAIL THIS TIME, THINK OF THIS, HOW ABOUT LOW IQ MAXINE WATERS. HOW ABOUT GREEN? WITH GREEN HOW ABOUT GREEN WHERE HE SAID WE HAVE TO IMPEACH HIM BECAUSE IF WE DON'T IMPEACH HIM WE ARE NOT GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. YOU KNOW WE ARE DEALING WITH SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE. WE ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE THAT DON'T RESPECT YOU, AND BY THE WAY YOU KNOW THEY TALK ABOUT THE ELITES. YOU ARE THE ELITES AND OUR FAMILY. YOU ARE THE ELITES, YOU HAVE BETTER EDUCATION, YOU'VE GOT BETTER EVERYTHING, YOU ARE THE ELITES. IT ALWAYS BOTHERS ME THAT THEY SAY THE ELITES, THIS IS THE ELITES, LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL. JUNIOR WHO THE ELITES? YOU LOOK AT THOSE JOBS REPORTS WHERE THE BEST IN HISTORY, UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THE BEST IN HISTORY UNEMPLOYMENT HISPANIC AMERICANS. BEST IN HISTORY UNEMPLOYMENT ASIAN AMERICANS. YOU ARE THE ELITES. YOU ARE THE ELITES. BUT THEY SAID THEY WILL DO IT AGAIN BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A TOTAL BUST. AND THEY WILL DO IT AGAIN. THE SENATE HAS BEEN SO PROFESSIONAL, SO GOOD, SO SOLID, JUST LIKE THESE GENTLEMEN IN THE HOUSE. SO SOLID. SO WE HAVE TO VOTE THESE CRAZY PEOPLE THE HELL OUT OF OFFICE AND IN 2020 I AM GOING TO WORK LIKE HELL THAT WE TAKE OVER THE HOUSE. WE HAVE TO TAKE OVER THE HOUSE. GOTTA TAKE OVER THE HOUSE MIKE. SO HERE ARE THE FACTS THAT SHIFT THE SHIFT, IS THAT BY THE WORST? HE COMES UP TO A MICROPHONE HE COMES UP TO THE MICROPHONE LIKE TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO, I HAVE ABSOLUTE PROOF THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSPIRED WITH RUSSIA. WITH RUSSIA? WHAT THE HELL DO I HAVE TO DO IF RUSSIA. RUSSIA WISHES HILLARY CLINTON ONE. WE ARE NOW NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD IN ENERGY, RUSSIA IS NUMBER THREE. WE ARE FEEDING NOW RUSSIA AND SAUDI ARABIA. YOU WILL HAVE WINDMILLS ALL OVER THE PLACE IF YOU HAD CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON? SHE BE KNOCKING OUT THOSE BIRDS LEFT AND RIGHT. THOSE LYNN MILLS WHILE WHILE WHILE. DARLING I WANT TO WATCH TELEVISION TONIGHT AND THERE'S NO DAMN WIND, WOULD I DO? I WANT TO WATCH THE ELECTION RESULTS, DARLING THERE'S NO WIND, THE DAMN WIND JUST ISN'T BLOWING LIKE IT USED TO BECAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING I THINK. I THINK IT'S GLOBAL WARMING. GLOBAL WARMING. NO MORE WINS, NO MORE LIGHTS, THE OCEAN IS GOING TO RISE ONE EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN THE NEXT 250 YEARS. WE ARE GOING TO BE WIPED OUT. LOOK, I WANT CLEAN AIR, CLEAN WATER I WANTED CRYSTAL CLEAN, AND THAT'S ALL WE HAVE AT A RECORD LEVEL. OUR AIR IN OUR WATER ARE CLEANER NOW THAN IT'S EVER BEEN. WITH ALL THAT WERE DOING. AND WE HAVEN'T CLOSED UP ALL OF OUR INDUSTRY. WE HAVE ENCLOSED A BAR IN BUSINESSES AND LOST ALL THOSE JOBS. AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE BY FAR THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND IF YOU REMEMBER, IF YOU LOOK, IF YOU GO BACK 567 YEARS, IN 2019 THEY SAY CHINA WAS GOING TO CATCH US AS THE WORLD'S LARGEST ECONOMY. GUESS WHAT, THEY ARE WAY BEHIND. THEY'RE WAY BEHIND. BECAUSE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS, YOU'VE SEEN THE STOCK MARKET SET A HUNDRED AND 31 RECORDS. THINK OF THAT. THAT MEANS JOBS, THAT MEANS 4O1K, I HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT COME UP AND SAY THANK YOU SIR. MY WIFE IS SO IN LOVE WITH ME BECAUSE I WENT UP 79% IN THE 4O1K. SHE THANKS I'M A GENIUS. SHELLEY'S THOUGHT I WAS A TOTAL STIFF, A DUMB STUPID DOUBT. NOW SHE THANKS I'M A FINANCIAL GENIUS. AND ALL I DID WAS BUY SOME STOCK. I HAVE STOCK IN A 4O1K. AND YOU MADE ME INTO A GENIUS. SIR SHE LOVES ME SO MUCH MORE THAN SHE DID BEFORE. THAT SHOWS YOU THE POWER OF MONEY. BUT I HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE, 401KS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. JOBS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. WE HAVE THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, AND NOW MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN ANYTHING, WAGES ARE UP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY, MANY YEARS, DECADES. DECADES. YOU REMEMBER FOUR YEARS AGO I WAS HERE, AND I TOLD PEOPLE, YOU NOTICED 20 YEARS AGO PEOPLE MADE MORE MONEY THAN THEY MADE FOUR YEARS AGO. NOT NOW, NOT ANYMORE. BECAUSE PEOPLE NOW CANNOT ONLY MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY IF THEY DON'T LIKE THEIR JOB, THEY GO OUT AND THEY GET A DIFFERENT JOB. AND THEY GET MORE MONEY AND ULTIMATELY THEY FIND ONE THAT THEY LOVE. YOU HAVE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT NOW. WAGES ARE UP, JOBS ARE UP. AND TODAY WE SET A NEW RECORD ALMOST 100 TO 60 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WORKING. WE'VE NEVER COME CLOSE TO THAT NUMBER. THAT'S ONE HELL OF A NUMBER. BUT JUST QUICKLY HEAR THE FACTS ON SHIFTY SHIFT. I SAW THIS GUY HE SAID THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE READ PETER LEE DECLARED THAT THERE WAS NO PRESSURE, BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO SAY THAT. WE SAID SAY IT SAY IT YOU CRICKET VASTER. SAY IT. : : : I DON'T KNOW BUT I RESPECT THEM BECAUSE THE UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AND HE SAID IT SO STRONGLY, I HAVE NEVER SEEN A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN INVESTIGATIONS AND SECURITY ASSISTANCE, HE JUST SAID THAT. THE DEMOCRATS WERE CORRUPT, THEY REFUSE TO SAY THAT, THAT IS ULTIMATELY THE ONES THAT MATTER, THE LEADERS OF UKRAINE. THERE'S THE ONE THAT KNOW OF THE PRESSURE NOT SOME CRICKET AMBASSADOR THAT IS A DEEP STATER OR A BARACK OBAMA MASTER. OKAY. THE ONES THAT MATTER ARE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COUNTRY THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT, THEY REFUSE TO SAY IT BECAUSE THEIR DISHONEST PEOPLE. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO STOP THE RABBIT PARTISAN DEMOCRATS, PENNSYLVANIA VOTERS MUST SHOW UP IN 2020 SO WE CAN TAKE BACK THE HOUSE, HOLD THE SENATE AND KEEP THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S ONLY WAY. IT'S ONLY WAY. OKAY, SO I'M GOING TO ASK THESE PEOPLE TO COME UP ON THE STAGE BECAUSE WE HAVE WARRIORS WITH US TONIGHT, WE LOVE WARRIORS. LIKE THE GUYS THAT KILLED AL-BAGHDADI, DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH PRESS I GOT, I DON'T CARE ABOUT PRESS BUT CONAN THE DOG GOT MORE THAN I DID, THAT'S OKAY. HE WAS ALMOST ELECTROCUTED, HE DESERVES IT. THEY GAVE ME ABOUT A DAY AND THAT'S OKAY. BECAUSE THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WE MADE A GREAT DECISION. I REMEMBER AL-BAGHDADI WAS THE FOUNDER OF ISIS, A VICIOUS ROUSSEAURUTHLESS PERSON. AND WE NOW HAVE TAKEN 100% AND WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF ISIS AND WITH OBAMA, YOU DID NOTHING. BUT GET YOUR ASS KICKED. WE ARE JOINED TONIGHT BY MANY OF THE TERRIFIC WARRIORS THAT HAVE HELPED ME SO MUCH IN SO MANY WAYS, THEY FIGHT FOR US, THEY ARE INCREDIBLE AND THEY COME RIGHT FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED WHAT BITING KEEP SAYING, HE SAYS OHIO, IT'S GREAT TO BE IN IOWA TONIGHT. IN FEES IN PENNSYLVANIA IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY. WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. HOW MANY TIMES CAN YOU DO THAT, SO FAR, IT COULD HAPPEN BECAUSE I WAS DOING SIX AND SEVEN A DAY THAT LAST MONTH, THAT LAST BEAUTIFUL MONTH I LOVED. I LEFT THESE GUYS ALONE I DO NOT WANT TO DO IT, WASTE OF TIME BIG BEAUTIFUL RALLIES AND DO NO I WENT TO MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN AND THINK OF WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON THESE CROWDS ARE INCREDIBLE. WE HAD SOME OF THE BIGGEST CROWDS, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYBODY THAT DREW CROWDS LIKE WE DRAW. AND I DON'T HAVE A A GUITAR. IF YOU TOOK RONALD REAGAN, AND WE ALL LIKE RONALD REAGAN I THOUGHT HE WAS A GUY GUY. IF HE CAME TO PENNSYLVANIA FOR A RALLY AND HAD A THOUSAND PEOPLE, WERE GETTING CROWDS 25 - 30000 PEOPLE IN THERE MUST BE 20000 PEOPLE OUTSIDE. WE SET UP SCREENS OUTSIDE AND IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN THE RING WATCHING, TO PEOPLE OFF THERE I'M SORRY. IT'S PRETTY ROUGH, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. GIVE ME THIS THE BIGGEST ARENA YOU CAN GIVE ME, WE DON'T HAVE EMPTY SEATS, HOW MANY SEATS AS THIS 11000, 10500, IT'S BEYOND THAT. AND LOOK AT THE FLOOR,. AND THEN YOU GO OUT AND YOU LOOK OUTSIDE AND YOU HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS BECAUSE THERE IS A SPIRIT TO WHAT WERE DOING, WERE FIXING AND HEALING OUR COUNTRY. WERE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. SO I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OF HER GREAT WARRIORS TO COME FORWARD, REPRESENTATIVE GLENN THOMPSON. COME UP GLENN. AMANDA HAS BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME, MIKE KELLY. DO NOT GET IN A FIGHT WITH HIM. , P MIKE. A WONDERFUL MAN WHO REPRESENTS THIS AREA, SCOTT PERRY. REPRESENTATIVE FLOYD SCHMUCKER. AND A GUY WHO IS ALWAYS THERE FOR US JOHN JOYCE. AND TO PEOPLE THAT YOU ALL KNOW VERY WELL IN THE STATE, THEY BRING HOME THE BACON, DAN USER AND FRED KELLER. I WANT TO ALSO BRING BACK OUR PENNSYLVANIA PARTY CHAIRMAN AND I KNEW HIS GRANDFATHER, I SHOULD NOT SAY THAT TO YOU, HE WAS A TREMENDOUS MAN. BUT I AM GOING TO INTRODUCE SOMEBODY THAT DAN ALWAYS HAD HAD TREMENDOUS TALENT AND LITTLE DID I KNOW HE WOULD BE WORKING WITH US AND HE'S WORKING WELL, HE'S SMART, TOUGH, LAWRENCE DAVIS. ALSO WITH US TONIGHT, PENNSYLVANIA VICTORY CHAIRWOMAN COMFORT, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO THAT IS. NATIONAL COMMITTEEMAN BOB ASHER, COCHAIRMAN TOMMY, AN INCREDIBLE FRIEND, DAVID IRVIN. I JUST WANT TO THINK, THIS IS AN AMAZING GROUP OF PEOPLE. WITH THEIR HELP IN THE HELP OF EVERYONE HERE, WE ARE GOING TO SET RECORDS LIKE WE'VE NEVER SAID BEFORE. I USED TO SAY AND I STILL HAVE TO SAY, 2016 I DON'T KNOW IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT CAN EVER HAPPEN. BUT WERE MUCH BETTER, ALL OF THE THINGS THAT I SAID CUT TAXES, CUT REGULATION, TAKE CARE OVER EVENTS, LOOK WHAT WE DID FOR OUR VETS. LOOK WHAT WE DID. LOOK WHAT WE DID, WE NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIRE ALL OF THE BAD PEOPLE IN THE VA. OVER 8000 PEOPLE WE FIRED THAT WERE DISRESPECTING OUR VETS. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IN 'PRIMETIME', I CAN TELL YOU THAT. BUT WHAT WE DO FOR OUR VETS, AND REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, WHAT WE'VE DONE IN SO MANY WAYS AND WE UNLIKE THE DEMOCRATS, WILL PROTECT YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. SO WE HAVE DONE A JOB AND WE ARE PROUD OF IT AND WE HAVE TREMENDOUS PEOPLE, LET'S GIVE THEM A HAND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, THANK YOU EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. VOTE FOR THESE PEOPLE. EVEN IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THEM VOTE FOR THEM. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NEW HAT THAT GUY HAS ON. HOW IS THAT HAT WORKING OUT, I LOVE THAT HAT. LOOK AT THIS GUY, THAT SAYS KEEP AMERICA GREAT. SHOULD WE DO A POLL? ARE YOU READY, SO WE HAVE THE GREATEST PHRASE IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND WE HAVE OUR NEW WHEN WE MADE AMERICA GREAT, STOCK MARKET, WE REBUILD, CUT TAXES, THAT NOBODY COULD EVEN THINK POSSIBLE. IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR MEDIAN INCOME, TAKE A LOOK WITH TOPPING, THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD, WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AND WENT UP $400 IN EIGHT YEARS, WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, IT WENT UP $975. THAT WAS IN EIGHT YEARS. WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP IT WENT UP 5000. BUT WAIT IN LESS THEN THREE YEARS, THAT'S A BIG THING, WAIT, WHEN YOU ADD ENERGY SAVINGS AND YOU ADD TAX SAVINGS, YOU HAVE ALMOST A 10000-DOLLAR SAVINGS. AND THAT IS ONE OF THE BIG REASONS WHY OUR DATA AND REGULATIONS ONE OF THE BIG REASONS OUR ECONOMY IS GROWING BECAUSE OF OUR CONSUMER IS LOADED WITH MONEY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. PRESIDENT I APPRECIATE IT. BUT WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE HERE, WE HAVE NOW THE HOTTEST ECONOMY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN DICTATORS AND PRESIDENTS AND KINGS AND QUEENS AND PRIME MINISTERS THEY COME TO THE BEAUTIFUL OVAL OFFICE OF RESPECTED AND THE FIRST THING THEY ALMOST ALWAYS SAY, SIR, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ECONOMY, WERE TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING. AND I SAY YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT. THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO. LET THEM GIVE IT A SHOT BUT THEY ALL SAY CONGRATULATIONS ON THE GREAT JOB YOU'VE DONE BUT WE'VE ALL DONE A GREAT JOB, NOT ME, WE'VE ALL DONE IT. I'VE DONE A GOOD JOB A SPOKESMAN. BUT THEY ALL SAY THAT. BUT WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB IN MANY WAYS, ALL THE PROMISES THAT I MADE, I'M THE ONLY POLITICIAN IN THE HISTORY THAT HAS ACTUALLY KEPT OR PROMISES THAT I MADE. THINK OF THAT. NONETHELESS, LIKE A THING LIKE RIGHT TO DRIVE, NOBODY TALKED ABOUT THAT, WE ARE RIGHT TO DRIVE, SOMEBODY TERMINALLY ILL, THE GREATEST MEDICINES IN THE WORLD AND THE GREATEST DOCTORS, GREATEST LABS IN THE WORLD NOBODY CLOSE BUT OPAQUE TAKES YEARS TO GET IT APPROVED AND I GOT IT APPROVED. SEEK AND SIGN A DOCUMENT AND GET IT. IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE LIVES WERE SAVING IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. A BEAUTIFUL THING IS HAPPENING. BUT WE'VE ALSO CREATED 7 MILLION NEW JOBS TO IF I WOULD'VE SAID THAT THE FAKE NEWS WOULD'VE GONE CRAZY, THEY WOULD'VE SAID THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND THEY WOULD'VE GONE CRAZY, THEY GO CRAZY ANYWAY AND WHEN I DON'T SAY IT. RIGHT HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA WE HAVE MADE 160,000 BRAND-NEW BEAUTIFUL JOBS. AND COMPANIES MOVING IN AND MOVING BACK AND AS I SAID AFRICAN-AMERICAN IS AMERICAN ASIAN UNEMPLOYMENT THE LOWEST EVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, THE LOWEST ON EMPLOYMENT RATE, WAGES FOR LOW-INCOME WORKERS HAVE GONE UP MORE THAN 10%, NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS POSSIBLE, ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN TERMS OF THE GROUPS, ONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES, THEY SHARE 40 MILLION AMERICAN FAMILIES WILL BENEFIT FROM THE REPUBLICANS JOB TAX CREDIT, EACH RECEIVING AN AVERAGE OF $2,200,200. WE ENDED THE LAST OF MINISTRATION WITH AMERICAN ENERGY THAT THE UNITED STATES IS NOW, I SAID IT AND I'LL SAY IT ALL NIGHT LONG, NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS IN THE WORLD AND THERE IS NOBODY EVEN CLOSE. AND THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION IS UP 34% SINCE HER ELECTION. VIRTUALLY EVERY LEADING DEMOCRAT HAS PLEDGED TO ENTIRELY ELIMINATE AMERICAN PRODUCTION OF OIL, CLEAN COAL, NATURAL GAS. I DON'T THINK SOMEBODY COMING IN TO PENNSYLVANIA, YOU KNOW THOSE CHEMICAL PLANTS, THEY DON'T LIKE THEM AT ALL. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS, INCREDIBLE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAXES, HOW ABOUT GOING TO THE STATE OF TEXAS, WE HAD ONE CANDIDATE WHO TURNED OUT TO BE TOO GOOD OF A CANDIDATE, BETO. REMEMBER. SO HE WANTED TO GET RID OF RELIGION, THE BIBLE, AND HE WANTED TO GET RID OF OIL. HOW ABOUT GOING TO TEXAS AND SAY NO BIBLE, NO OIL, NO GUNS. I THINK ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND YOU CANNOT WIN THAT PARTICULAR RACE. IT WOULD NOT BE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA THAT I CAN TELL YOU. BUT YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES IN THAT IS SLEEPY JOE BIDEN, HE WAS CAUGHT TYING A FAR LEFT RADICAL ACTIVIST THAT HE WOULD SHUT DOWN FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION AND PENNSYLVANIA. YOU SAW THAT. BUT THE MOTORS OF THE COMMONWEALTH WILL NEVER EVER LET THAT HAPPEN. CAN YOU IMAGINE A GUY, WHETHER TIM OR BERNIE, HE JUST RAISES HIS HAND, HE HAS NO CLUE WHAT HE'S DOING, HE ONE TO GIVE ILLEGAL ALIENS HEALTHCARE EVEN THOUGH WE TAKE IT AWAY FROM HER OWN SOLDIERS AND HE LOOKS AND THEY'RE ALL RAISING THEIR HAND, DID YOU SEE THAT, OKAY ALL DUE TO. IN ADDITION TO REPLACING NAFTA I'VE TAKEN THE TOUGHEST EVER ACTION AGAINST CHINA'S TRADE ABUSES, THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL SO BADLY. I WAS DOING WELL BUT THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL. PLEASE MAKE A DEAL, WE DON'T WANT TO PAY TERRORIST ANYMORE. PLEASE PLEASE. THANKS TO OUR STEEL TARIFFS, STEEL AND PENNSYLVANIA ARE ROARING BACK TO LIFE IN U.S. STEEL HAS JUST ANNOUNCED A 1 BILLION-DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN NON-VALLEY WORKS IN PITTSBURGH. YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT, $1 BILLION. THEY WEREN'T INVESTING THEY WERE DIVESTING. THE STEEL COMPANY IS AN AMAZING ACHIEVEMENT. WE TAXED ALL THE STEEL COMING IN FROM CHINA AND OTHER PLACES PRE-25%. ALL OF A SUDDEN OUR STEEL METAL IS AT 2 MILLION AGAIN. WE NEED THAT FOR DEFENSE IN OUR SHIPS AND AIRPLANES, WE CANNOT PLAY GAMES WITH STEEL. AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING OTHER NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR NATION. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, EVERYTHING THAT WE DO, WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. SORRY. WE GAVE UP ON THE GLOBALISTS AND SAID LET'S BUILD THE WORLD AND FORGET ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AND REBUILD THE WORLD. NO ISSUE HAVE THE DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS BROUGHT THOROUGHLY BETRAYED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEN ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION IMMIGRATION, FAR LEFT POLITICIANS, THEIR FIGHTING ME ON THE WALL, BUT WERE BUILDING THAT WE HAVE THE MILITARY MONEY COMING IN. BELIEVE ME. IF I WEREN'T A GOOD DEVELOPER YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT THE WALL. THESE PEOPLE THOUGHT ME AND WE STARTED WINNING IN COURT AND YOU KNOW WHAT, SPEAKING OF COURT, WE WILL SOON HAVE 182 FEDERAL JUDGES INCLUDING COURT OF APPEALS. NOBODY CAN BELIEVE IT. ALL BECAUSE BARACK OBAMA GAVE US 142 WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT THEY ALWAYS SAY I DISAGREE, RIGHT. BUT BEYOND DEFENSE THEY WOULD SAY THE MOST APART THING YOU CAN DO IS JUSTICE, JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT, TWO GREAT ONES. BUT THEY ALWAYS SAY JUDGES AND SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AND WHEN YOU LEAVE OFFICE, I HOPE IN FIVE YEARS, NINE YEARS, 13 YEARS, 17 YEARS, 21 YEARS, 25 YEARS,. 29 YEARS WHEN I LEAVE OFFICE, I'M ONLY DOING THAT TO DRIVE THEM TOTALLY CRAZY. THAT DRIVES THEM CRAZY. EVEN JOKING ABOUT IT. WE HAVE THIS IDIOT COMEDIAN WHO SAYS, HE'S TALKING TO A GUEST RIGHT, HE SAID YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO WIN, WERE GOING TO FIGHT AND THEY WILL IN THE CITY'S GOING TO WIN, YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO WIN AND HE'S NEVER LEAVING DON'T YOU. AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT HE WAS KIDDING. HE'S A WHACK JOB, HE WAS TOTALLY SERIOUS, HE HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT. SHOULD WE GIVE IT A SHOT, MAYBE WE WILL. I'M ONLY KIDDING, THEY WON'T WRITE THAT, THEY WON'T WRITE THE I'M ONLY KIDDING PART, BUT POLITICIANS SUPPORT EVERY SANCTUARY CITY DEVASTATING FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS. THESE JURISDICTIONS DELIBERATELY RELEASE DANGEROUS VIOLENT CRIMINAL ALIENS OUT OF THE JAIL AND DIRECTLY ONTO YOUR STREETS WHERE THEY ARE FREE TO OFFEND AND FREE TO KILL, WHERE THEY ARE FREE TO RAPE, FREE TO BEAT UP PEOPLE EXCEPT FOR ICE. THEY DON'T BEAT UP ICE, YOU'RE LUCKY WE HAVE ICE, THEY WANT TO PUT ICE OUT OF BUSINESS AND THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. ICE IS INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, GREAT PATRIOTS AND THEY'RE TOUGH. THANKS TO DEMOCRAT IMMIGRATION POLICY, INNOCENT AMERICANS IN ALL 50 STATES ARE BEING BRUTALIZED AND MURDERED BY ILLEGAL ALIENS CRIMINALS. LAST SUMMER AT LEAST 19 ILLEGAL ALIENS WERE CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH GRIZZLY HOMICIDES INCLUDING HACKING VICTIMS TO DEATH AND RIPPING OUT INTO CASES, THEIR HEARTS. WEEKS AGO TO ILLEGAL ALIENS AND MEMBERS OF THE SAVAGE GANG WHO WE ARE REMOVING FROM OUR COUNTRY BY THE THOUSANDS. WERE CHARGED WITH RELENTLESSLY BEATING A WONDERFUL BEAUTIFUL HIGH SCHOOL TEENAGER TO DEATH WITH A BASEBALL BAT AND CHOPPING THE BODY APART WITH A MACHETE. ONE OF THE ANIMALS ACCUSED WAS RELEASED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN DEFIANCE OF AN ICE DEMAND. I SAID YOU CANNOT LET THEM GO, THEY WANTED THEM. THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR THEM. THEY WANTED THEM TO HAND THEM OVER FOR DEPORTATION BACK TO HIS COUNTRY AND GET THEM THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. RIGHT. DEMOCRAT SANCTUARY CITIES ALSO GIVE SAFE HAVEN TO THOSE WHO COMMIT VIOLENT CRIMES, SINCE MONTGOMERY COUNTY MARYLAND DECLARED ITSELF A SANCTUARY JURISDICTION IN JULY, WE HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED NINE ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR RAPE, SEXUAL ASSAULT, INCLUDING A 26-YEAR-OLD MAN CHARGED WITH RAPING AND VICIOUSLY STRANGLING A YOUNG WONDERFUL WOMAN WHO WAS ENTERING HER APARTMENT INNOCENTLY ENTERING HER APARTMENT SHE WAS KILLED, STRANGLED TO DEATH. SANCTUARY CITIES, MARYLAND. BUT THESE ARE ONLY THE CASES THAT WE KNOW ABOUT. SANCTUARY CITIES AND JAILS ACTIVELY CONCEAL ILLEGAL ALIEN CRIME AND CRIMINALS FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WANTS TO TAKE THEM OUT OR IN SOME CASES IF IT'S REAL VIOLENCE, AND WE DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR THE COST, BUT WE DO, PUT THEM INTO VERY STRONG JAILS. THE SANCTUARY CITY OF PHILADELPHIA AND THE SANCTUARY CITY OF PHILADELPHIA. IT'S ONE OF THE VERY WORST SANCTUARY ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. DID YOU KNOW THAT? I KNOW PHILADELPHIA WELL GOING TO SCHOOL HERE, WE NEVER HEARD ABOUT SANCTUARY CITIES DID WE. WEEKS AGO AND ILLEGAL ALIEN CHARGED WITH RAPE, SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A CHILD AND INFLICTING SERIOUS BODILY INJURY WAS RELEASED BY PHILADELPHIA TO BE THE FREE AND THEIR COMMUNITY. AND BY THE WAY, YOU MAY HAVE THE WORST DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR WHATEVER THIS GUY, I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THIS GUY HE LIKES KILLERS OUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, WHAT THE HELL, HOW DID YOU LET THAT HAPPEN. INSTEAD OF HANDING THEM OVER WHILE STILL IN JAIL, HE DEFIED ICE, THEY FOUGHT WITH ICE AND SET HIM LOOSE ON UNSUSPECTING FAMILY, THANKFULLY I GREAT TIME AND EFFORT ARE BRAVE ICE OFFICERS WERE EVENTUALLY ABLE TO TRACK HIM DOWN, ARREST HIM, DETAIN HIM AND DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE. AND HOW DO YOU ELECT DEMOCRATS WHEN THEY CREATE AS SANCTUARY CITY OF PHILADELPHIA, I DO NOT GET IT. FOUR GANG MEMBERS WERE ARRESTED IN PENNSYLVANIA OF THE KILLING OF A 21-YEAR-OLD AND A 15-YEAR-OLD. AS WE SPEAK CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIEN WITH THREE PRIOR DEPORTATIONS IS ROAMING FREE IN PENNSYLVANIA BECAUSE HE WAS RELEASED BY THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA, THE CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE. YOU BETTER GET YOURSELF A BETTER PROSECUTOR IN THIS PLACE, I WANT TO TELL YOU. THAT'S A HORRIBLE THING, IT'S A NATIONAL STORY HOW HE WANTS EVERYBODY TO NOT PAY THE PRICE AND ARE TALKING ABOUT NOT PAYING THE PRICE FOR RAPE, MURDER, OTHER HORRIBLE CRIMES. HOW STUPID, HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE. THE CHARGES AGAINST THIS ALIEN INCLUDE RAPE, AGGRAVATED ASSAULT, UNLAWFUL CONTACT WITH A MINOR, INDECENT EXPOSURE AND TERRORISTIC THREATS. OTHER THAN THAT HE WAS A VERY NICE PERSON PHILADELPHIA HAS DEFINED ICE AND RELEASED ILLEGALS CHARGED WITH EVERYTHING FROM ASSAULT TO KIDNAPPING TO DRUG CRIMES TO CRIMES TO HOMICIDE MURDER, DEMOCRATS STAND FOR CRIME, CORRUPTION AND CHAOS AND REPUBLICAN STAND FOR LAW AND ORDER AND JUSTICE. WE STAND FOR JUSTICE. WE DIVE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AS AMERICANS NOT RUTHLESS GANG MEMBERS AND NOT VIOLENT CRIMINALS, ALIENS ARE COMING TO OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND TAKE OUR PAYMENTS, SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WITH THESE CRAZY LAWS, LOOK WHAT'S GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA, THEY DO BETTER THAN HER GREAT VETERANS, THEY DO BETTER THAN CITIZENS OF OUR COUNTRY. AS THEY ADVERTISE, WE WILL TAKE YOU, WE WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU, WE WILL PAY FOR IT AND THEN YOU WONDER WHY WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO COME THROUGHOUT THE BORDER. BUT WE DO A GREAT JOB. WERE REMOVING THESE CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS FROM OUR COUNTRY BY THE THOUSANDS AND SENDING THEM HOME, WE ARE NOT LETTING THEM COME BACK IN. WE ARE BEING VERY TOUGH. IN MEXICO IS NOW GIVING US 27000 SOLDIERS AT OUR BORDER IN GUATEMALA, HONDURAS AND EL SALVADOR WE SIGNED A VERY IMPORTANT AGREEMENT WITH EACH, WHEN THEIR PEOPLE COME INTO OUR COUNTRY THEY WEREN'T TAKEN ABACK AND NOW THEY TAKE THEM BACK AND SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEY WEREN'T TAKING THEM BACK, IF WE HAD A MURDERER FROM HONDURAS OR GAUTAMA OR'S EL SALVADOR AND WANT TO BRING THEM BACK UNDER PASSIVE MINISTRATIONS THEY WOULD BRING THEM AND THEY SAY WE DON'T WANT THEM. AND WITH US THEY SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL TAKE THEM BACK. BECAUSE WE LET THEM KNOW THE PRICE IS VERY BAD IF THEY DON'T DO THAT. THANKS TO HER TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE BORDER, ILLEGAL HIS DOWN 75% SINCE MAY AND THE WALL IS GOING UP AT A VERY RAPID PACE. THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS HAVE GOTTEN MORE AND MORE EXTREME AND THAT'S WHY THEY DID THIS IMPEACHMENT HOAX BECAUSE NANCY PELOSI HAD NO CONTROL. SHE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. SHE KNEW, THE RADICAL LEFT IS TAKING OVER THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING FOR A SOCIALIST TAKEOVER THAT WOULD STRIP YOU OF THE DOCTOR AND COVERAGE OF YOUR CHOICE. WE HAVE 180 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRIVATE HEALTHCARE THAT LOVE IT. THEY WILL TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU. I DON'T THINK SO. CRAZY ELIZABETH WARREN, OR AS I AFFECTIONATELY CALL HER, POCAHONTAS. HER RIDICULOUS PLAN WOULD COST $52 TRILLION, THAT IS MORE MONEY THAT WE HAVE TAKEN ONE YEAR, TWO YEARS, THREE YEARS, FOUR YEARS FIVE YEARS, SIX YEARS, ABOUT SEVEN YEARS, THAT IS FOR ONE YEAR. $52 TRILLION AND YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR DOCTOR. SHE'S STARTING TO CRASH AGAIN. I THOUGHT I KNOCKED HER DOWN, I DID THAT HEAVY POCAHONTAS DEAL. I GIVE HER CREDIT I THOUGHT SHE WAS DONE FOR. THERE'S JUST LITTLE EMBERS. AND THEN SHE ROSE AND BECAME STRONG BUT THEN SHE OPENED THAT FRESH MOUTH OF HERS AND THAT STOPPED. I DON'T SEE HER I DON'T THINK SHE MAKES IT. YOU DON'T KNOW, CRAZY THINGS HAPPEN AT THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, IT USED TO BE A SANE PARTY NOW IT'S AN INSANE PARTY. BUT THEY'RE ALL LOOKING AT THE SAME THING, YOU HAVE ALFRED RUNNING. PETE BUTTIGIEG, CAN YOU BELIEVE HE IS DOING WELL, HE'S LIKE THE LEADING FUNDRAISER, I DREAM ABOUT HIM. IT'S TRUE. BUT I'M NOT GOING TOO FAR WITH ANY OF THESE PEOPLE. BECAUSE I WAS WAY TOO EARLY WITH ELIZABETH WARREN, WE DESTROYED HER TOO FAST. SO SHE CAME BACK. BUT SHE'S GOING BACK DOWN AGAIN. DID ANYBODY SEE HER BEER DEAL ABOUT HER HUSBAND, DARLENE IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE. , THAT'S HER HUSBAND SUPPOSED TO BE LIVING IN THE HOUSE, YOU'RE HERE? I DON'T THINK SHE HAD SEEN HIM IN TEN YEARS. I HAVE AN IDEA, LET'S GET A BEER BEER. SHE'S SUCH A PHONY DISGUSTING. REPUBLICANS WILL DEFEND YOUR SACRED RIGHTS YOU CHOOSE, THE DOCTOR AND YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR PLAN AND THE PLAN THAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU, WE WILL STRONGLY PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND WE WILL ALSO PROTECT YOUR RIGHT TO GET THE PHYSICIAN THAT YOU WANT. VIRTUALLY EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT NOW SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH AND THE CHARACTER IN VIRGINIA, DID YOU SEE THE VIRGINIA GOVERNOR. HE GAVE THE BABY IS BORN AND THERE'S NO OTHER WORD IF THE MOTHER DECIDES NO THAN THE EXECUTE THE BABY. HE IS THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA AND WHY THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT GOING TO WIN VIRGINIA THIS NEXT ELECTION 2020, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE WILL GIVE IT A VERY STRONG SHOT WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE THAT WE WILL GIVE IT A STRONG SHOT. THAT'S WHY I'VE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTION, SOCIALISM AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THE PARTY OF HONEST ABE LINCOLN. I TOLD YOU ABOUT JUSTICE AND I'M TELLING YOU ABOUT SO MANY OTHER THINGS, THERE IS NOBODY THAT HAS EVER DONE WHAT WE ARE DOING. YOU LOOK AT SCHOOL CHOICE FOR EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA WHO NEEDS IT INCLUDING THE 50000 PENNSYLVANIA STUDENTS WHO YOUR DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR HAS BLOCKED FROM GETTING SCHOOL CHOICE SCHOLARSHIPS. NO SCHOLARSHIPS AVAILABLE. WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN. I WITHDREW FROM THE HORRIBLE ONE-SIDED IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, IT'S A DISASTER. I RECOGNIZE ISRAEL TRUE CAPITAL AND OPEN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY. FOR YEARS HE WATCHED AS YOUR POLITICIANS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA AND YOU NEVER HAD THAT BETTER EXPERIENCE. NEVER. NOW IS SURVIVAL OF THE AMERICAN NATION ITSELF, IT'S A SURVIVAL. WE WILL DESTROY OUR COUNTRY IF THESE PEOPLE GET IN. I SAY WE DON'T SO MUCH THE FIRST THREE YEARS, WILL SOON BE FOUR YEARS, ALL OF A SUDDEN THE TIME WILL BE UP BUT IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU PLANT A TREE, AND NEEDS TIME TO GRAB ON, IT NEEDS TIME, IT HAS TO GRAB AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED WE NEED TIME AND ONE THING WE WILL DO, WE STILL HAVE TREMENDOUS REGULATION COMING THAT WE CAN DO. WE'VE CUT ALL REGULATIONS THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, WE DID IT IN LESS THAN TWO AND HALF YEARS. WE DID IT IN LESS THAN TWO AND HALF YEARS AND ONE REGULATION, WE HAVE REGULATION AND YOU NEED SOME REGULATION, BUT YOU DON'T NEED REGULATION THAT DOESN'T BUILD A TEMPLE ROAD OR HIGHWAY. WHAT WE HAVE DONE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THE JOB NUMBERS ARE SO GOOD. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO INHERIT THE BIRTHRIGHT OF AMERICAN LIBERTY THAT GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED FOR TO SECURE, WE MUST DEVOTE EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE FOR VICTORY IN 2020 AND WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. ONLY THIS WAY CAN WE SAVE THE AMERICA THAT WE LOVE AND CLEAN UP WASHINGTON CORRUPTION ONCE AND FOR ALL AND WITH YOUR HELP WE WILL HAVE LIFT MILLIONS OF OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE AND POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS PROSPERITY GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY. AND THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING, YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND YOUR JOBS, YOU'VE NEVER HAD A TIME LIKE THIS, THEY ALWAYS SAY ARE YOU BETTER OFF NOW THAN FOUR YEARS AGO, WHO IS BETTER OFF NOW, EVERYBODY. BUT TOGETHER, WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR SAFE, SANE AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION, WE WILL ENACT TRADE DEALS THAT RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS, PROBABLY STAND WITH THE BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, MADE IN THE USA. WE JUST FINISHED A DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA, WE JUST FINISHED A 40 BILLION-DOLLAR DEAL WITH JEFF AND WERE IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING OUR DEAL DONE, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS, THEY WANT TO MAKE IT MORE THAN I DO BECAUSE WERE GETTING A LOT OF MONEY, WE'VE NEVER TAKEN MONEY FROM CHINA AND NOW IT'S COMING IN BY THE BILLIONS AND WHEN THEY TARGET OUR FARMER, I GIVE OUR FARMERS THAT MONEY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TARGETED AND OUR FARMERS ARE THRILLED. AND WE HAVE A LOT LEFT. BUT WE WILL EXCEED NEW BREAKTHROUGHS OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER AND ENDING THE AGE EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA, WE WILL HAVE THAT DONE. THAT COULD'VE STARTED EARLIER THAN THE BEGINNING OF OUR MINISTRATION, WE WILL HAVE THAT DONE IN LESS THAN TEN YEARS. THE AIDS EPIDEMIC WILL HAVE ENDED IN AMERICA IN LESS THAN TEN YEARS. WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. AND ABOVE ALL WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICA, ONE GREAT COUNTRY, ONE AMERICA THAT WE SUPPORT, PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. WE STAND WITH THE INCREDIBLE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND SANCTITY OF LIFE, THE GOVERNMENTS AND BUREAUCRACIES ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY, WE BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, ON OUR HISTORY AND ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. AND WE LIVE BY THE WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO IN GOD WE TRUST. AND WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF GENERATIONS OF PENNSYLVANIA PATRIOTS WHO GAVE THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS FOR THIS BELOVED NATION. PENNSYLVANIA IS THE PLACE WHERE OUR FOUNDING FATHERS DECLARED AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE, WHERE THE ARMY WEATHERED THE BRUTAL WINTER AND WHERE GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON LED HIS MEN ACROSS THE DELAWARE ON CHRISTMAS NIGHT. THEY USED THE PASSWORD, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE PASSWORD WAS, VICTORY OR DEATH. HOW INCREDIBLE IS THAT. VICTORY OR DEATH. PENNSYLVANIA IS A STATE THEY GAVE US SELF MADE TITANS OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY FROM ANDREW CARDIGAN TO MILTON HERSHEY. I LOVE HERSHEY'S. IN HENRY J HEINZ, PENNSYLVANIA IS THE PLACE WHERE STRONG AMERICAN WORKERS MIND THE COAL, WORK THE RAILROADS AND FORGE THE STEEL INTO THE GREATEST AND MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND WE ARE MAKING AN EVEN GREATER EVERY SINGLE DAY, IT IS GREATER THEN EVER BEFORE. AND PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE YOUR POWER AWAY, IT WILL NEVER EVER HAPPEN. WITH YOUR HELP, AND WITH YOUR DEVOTION AND YOUR DRIVE, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. WE WILL KEEP ON WINNING. WE ARE ONE MOVEMENT, ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD, AMERICA IS THRIVING LIKE NEVER BEFORE AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF PENNSYLVANIA, THE BEST IS YET TO COME. BECAUSE TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA PROUD AGAIN, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

         "Well, thank you very much. My fellow Americans, I greet you this morning from the White House to announce a major breakthrough toward achieving a better future for Syria and for the Middle East. It's been a long time. Over the last five days, you have seen that a ceasefire that we established along Syria's border has held, and it's held very well, beyond most expectations. Early this morning, the government of Turkey informed my administration that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria, and making the ceasefire permanent. And it will indeed be permanent. However you would also define the word 'permanent' in that part of the world as somewhat questionable, we all understand that. But I do believe it will be permanent. I have therefore instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to lift all sanctions imposed on October 14th in response to Turkey's original offensive moves against the Kurds in Syria's northeast border region. So the sanctions will be lifted unless something happens that we're not happy with. This was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else, no other nation. Very simple. And we're willing to take blame, and we're also willing to take credit. This is something they've been trying to do for many, many decades. Since then, others have come out to help, and we welcome them to do so. Other countries have stepped forward, they want to help, and we think that's great. The nations in the region must ultimately take on the responsibility of helping Turkey and Syria police their border. We want other nations to get involved. We've secured the oil, and, therefore, a small number of U.S. troops will remain in the area where they have the oil. And we're going to be protecting it, and we'll be deciding what we're going to do with it in the future. In any event, by the moves that we've made, we are achieving a much more peaceful and stable area between Turkey and Syria, including a 20-mile-wide safe zone. An interesting term, 'safe zone.' That's the term we're using it. Hopefully, that zone will become safe. Thousands and thousands of people have been killed in that zone over the years. But it's been sought for many, many decades, and I think we have something that's going to be strong and hold up. Turkey, Syria, and all forms of the Kurds, have been fighting for centuries. We have done them a great service, and we've done a great job for all of them. And now we're getting out. A long time. We were supposed to be there for 30 days; that was almost 10 years ago. So we're there for 30 days, and now we're leaving. It was supposed to be a very quick hit and let's get out. And it was a quick hit, except they stayed for almost 10 years. Let someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand. I want to thank Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo for leading the American delegation so successfully to Turkey several days ago, along with National Security Advisor O'Brien. I want to thank them very much. The American delegation negotiated the original five-day ceasefire that ended Kurdish fighters to safely leave. It just got them to a point where, frankly, they were able. It enabled them to get out, to go and move, really, just a few miles in a slightly different direction. So this enabled them to do so. Countless lives are now being saved as a result of our negotiation with Turkey , an outcome reached without spilling one drop of American blood. No injuries. Nobody shot, nobody killed. I have just spoken to General Mazloum, a wonderful man, the Commander-in-Chief of the SDF Kurds. And he was extremely thankful for what the United States has done. Could not have been more thankful. General Mazloum has assured me that ISIS is under very, very strict lock and key, and the detention facilities are being strongly maintained. There were a few that got out , a small number, relatively speaking , and they've been largely recaptured. I'm also sure that he will be issuing his own statement very shortly. We had a great talk. But we've saved the lives of many, many Kurds. He understands that. The war was going to be vicious and probably not very long. And I'm very happy to have been involved in it, as are our Vice President, our Secretary of State, and all of the other people on our team. By getting that ceasefire to stick, we've done something that's very, very special. But by getting the ceasefire after a tremendous amount of really tough war for a very short period of days, that is something very special. Our troops are safe, and the pain and suffering of the three-day fight that occurred was directly responsible for our ability to make an agreement with Turkey and the Kurds that could never have been made without this short-term outburst. Should Turkey fail to honor its obligations, including the protection of religious and ethnic minorities , which I truly believe they will do , we reserve the right to re-impose crippling sanctions, including substantially increased tariffs on steel and all other products coming out of Turkey. We are now an economic powerhouse like never before, and, very importantly, like no other. Our economic might is stronger than it's ever been, and our competitors are not doing very well. We also expect Turkey to abide by its commitment regarding ISIS. As a backup to the Kurds watching over them, should something happen, Turkey is there to grab them. Further, we implore European countries to come and take those fighters that the U.S. captured and bring them back to their countries for incarceration and for trial. Until just recently, Europe has been very unresponsive in doing what they should have been doing for a long time. Now is their chance to finally act. American forces defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate during the last two years. We thank the Syrian Democratic Forces for their sacrifices in this effort. They've been terrific. Now Turkey, Syria, and others in the region must work to ensure that ISIS does not regain any territory. It's their neighborhood; they have to maintain it. They have to take care of it. There were some political pundits who responded to Turkey's offensive in Syria by calling for yet another American military intervention. I don't think so. But halting the incursion by military force would have required deploying tens of thousands of American troops against Turkey , a NATO Ally and a country the United States has developed a very good relationship with, including President Erdo�an. The same people that I watched and read , giving me and the United States advice , were the people that I have been watching and reading for many years. They are the ones that got us into the Middle East mess but never had the vision or the courage to get us out. They just talk. How many Americans must die in the Middle East in the midst of these ancient sectarian and tribal conflicts? After all of the precious blood and treasure America has poured into the deserts of the Middle East, I am committed to pursuing a different course , one that leads to victory for America. Through much work, we have done things that everybody said couldn't be done. Today's announcement validates our course of action with Turkey that only a couple of weeks ago were scorned, and now people are saying, 'Wow. What a great outcome. Congratulations.' It's too early to me to be congratulated, but we've done a good job. We've saved a lot of lives. Most importantly, we have avoided another costly military intervention that could've led to disastrous, far-reaching consequences. Many thousands of people could've been killed. The last administration said, 'Assad must go.' They could've easily produced that outcome, but they didn't. In fact, they drew a very powerful red line in the sand , you all remember, the red line in the sand , when children were gassed and killed, but then did not honor their commitment as other children died in the same horrible manner. But I did honor my commitments with 58 Tomahawks. Eight long years after President Obama's ill-fated push at regime change, U.S. troops are still on the ground in Syria. More than half a million people are dead, hundreds of thousands are terribly injured, and millions more Syrians are displaced. It really is a nightmare of misery. Across the Middle East, we have seen anguish on a colossal scale. We have spent $8 trillion on wars in the Middle East, never really wanting to win those wars. But after all that money was spent and all of those lives lost, the young men and women gravely wounded , so many , the Middle East is less safe, less stable, and less secure than before these conflicts began. The same people pushing for these wars are often the ones demanding America open its doors to unlimited migration from war-torn regions, importing the terrorism and the threat of terrorism right to our own shores. But not anymore. My administration understands that immigration security is national security. As a candidate for President, I made clear that we needed a new approach to American foreign policy, one guided not by ideology, but by experience, history, and a realistic understanding of the world. We are building up America's military might like never before, investing $2.5 trillion since my election. But we will not be depleted. We will not happen again. It will not be allowed to happen again, where our military is depleted, fighting in areas of the world where we shouldn't be. When we commit American troops to battle, we must do so only when a vital national interest is at stake, and when we have a clear objective, a plan for victory, and a path out of conflict. That's what we have to have. We need a plan of victory. We will only win. Our whole basis has to be the right plan, and then we will only win. Nobody can beat us. Nobody can beat us. I want to again thank everyone on the American team who helped achieve the ceasefire in Syria, saved so many lives, along with President Erdo�an of Turkey , a man I've gotten to know very well and a man who loves his country. And, in his mind, he's doing the right thing for his country, and we may be meeting in the very near future. I also want to thank General Mazloum for his understanding and for his great strength and for his incredible words today to me , but me just as a representative of the United States , because he knows that we saved tens of thousands of Kurds. And we're not talking in the long term, we're talking in the short term. We're talking something that was going on immediately and something, frankly, that was planned for a long time. The job of our military is not to police the world. Other nations must step up and do their fair share. That hasn't taken place. Today's breakthrough is a critical step in that direction. Thank you all very much, and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you.",

         "Well, thank you very much. We had a very successful day. Pennsylvania was , that was incredible. The crowd was incredible. You saw what was unable to get in. We had thousands of people unable to get in. And I appreciate everybody being there. That was really a terrific moment, I think, coming off the plane. And it doesn't get any bigger than that. I did hear, though, when reentering the plane, I was told by Mark and Hope and some others that some horrible things were said. Fake things. Fake news. Corrupt news. The kind of news that's ruining your profession. And everyone knows it's totally false. General Keith Kellogg, who's a highly respected man, couldn't believe when he heard it. And he knows everything about , all of it. And to think that I would make statements negative to our military and our fallen heroes, when nobody has done what I've done, with the budgets, with the military budgets, with getting pay raises for our military. It is a disgraceful situation by a magazine that's a terrible magazine. I don't read it, but I just heard about it. They made it up. And, probably, it's a couple of people that have been failures in the administration that I got rid of. And I couldn't get rid of them fast enough. But , or it was just made up. But it's unthinkable. As far as John McCain is concerned, I was never a fan. And I will admit that openly. I disagreed with him on the endless wars. I disagreed with him with respect to the vets and the taking care of the VA. I wanted to do it a much different way. And I think it's proven to be a much more successful way when you look at the success we've had with the VA and with our vets, with Choice and with Accountability, all the things I've gotten. So I disagreed with John McCain, but I still respected him. And I had to approve his funeral as President. We lowered the flags. I had to approve that, nobody else. I had to approve it. When you think , as I'm just thinking back, I had to approve either Air Force One or a military plane to go to Arizona to pick up his casket. And I approved it immediately. I had to approve the funeral, because he had a first-class, triple-A funeral that lasted for nine days, by the way. I had to approve it. All of that had to be approved by the President. I approved it without hesitation and without complaint. And I felt he deserved it. I disagreed with him on things, and he was a tough guy, but I felt he deserved it. For somebody to say the things that they say I said is a total lie. It's fake news. It's a disgrace. And frankly, it's a disgrace to your profession. Now, with all of that being said, you'll speak to Keith Kellogg, you'll speak to other people, because many people knew. Let me just go into the , if I might, into the trip to Europe and to France. I was ready to go to a ceremony; I had two of them. One the following day; it was pouring, and I went to that. But the helicopter could not fly. The reason it couldn't fly is because it was raining about as hard as I've ever seen. And, on top of that, it was very, very foggy. And the helicopter was unable to fly. It was a fairly long helicopter flight, but it was a very long drive. In order for me to go, we would have had to leave immediately and go through very busy areas of, I guess, Paris , but a very, very heavily traveled area, a very , a big city. I think it was Paris. And the Secret Service told me, 'You can't do it.' I said, 'I have to do it. I want to be there.' They said, 'You can't do it.' We'll get you confirmation on this. They said, 'For you to do that' , make that trip not by helicopter flying over everything , 'we have to work with the police. We have to work with everything.' And I think you'll find on record, in the police force, in the areas that we're talking about , areas of Paris that we're talking about , I think you'll find on-record requests. And we actually have Secret Service that I'm going to ask to give you details. They said, 'You can't do it.' It was two and a half hours or two hours of driving. It was a long drive. They said, 'You can't do it.' So I said, 'No, I want to do it.' They said, 'You can't.' There was no way I would have been able to do it. And they would never have been able to get the police and everybody else in line to have a President go through a very crowded, very congested area. So I went and I called home. I spoke to my wife. I said, 'I hate this. I came here to go to that ceremony,' and to the one that was the following day, which I did go to. I said, 'I feel terribly.' And that was the end of it. Now, all of a sudden, somebody makes up this horrible story that I didn't want to go. And then they make up an even worse story , an even worse story, calling certain names to our fallen heroes. It's a disgrace that a magazine is able to write it. And anybody that , if the , if they really exist, if people really exist that would have said that, they're low-lives and they're liars. And I would be willing to swear on anything that I never said that about our fallen heroes. There is nobody that respects them more. So I just think it's a horrible, horrible thing. We made a great evening into, frankly, a very sad evening, when I see a statement like that. No animal, nobody , what animal would say such a thing? And especially since I've done more, I think, than almost anybody to help our military, to get the budgets of our military, to get the pay raises for our military. So I just think it's a horrible thing that they're allowed to write that. And we can refute it. We have other people that will refute it. And the one I would like you to speak to is General Keith Kellogg, because he knows exactly the story. But you can also speak to Secret Service. They wouldn't let me go no matter what happened, because of security, because of safety. So I want to thank you for being here. There's nothing much more that I can say. All they're trying to do is influence a presidential election, where we've gone very high in the polls in the last short period of time, where we're doing very well, where we're going to win and they're going crazy. The magazine in question is a never-Trumper magazine, probably doing badly. I know nothing about it. I don't read it; I just heard about it now , about this story. But it's a total never-Trumper magazine and other people that are trying to influence the outcome of a presidential election. And you know what? People are too smart for it. And somebody has to make a stand. This fake press is a disgrace. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.",

         "So, I hope everybody is having a good time. We're doing our third stop of five. We have great crowds. The first two were extremely cold. But they're great people, so that warmed it up. We're doing tremendous numbers. Florida is doing very well. Ohio, as you heard, is doing phenomenally well. I think we're ahead of Ohio from four years ago, and we won by eight. If you look at North Carolina, we're doing great. We're doing , I think we're doing well all over. Georgia looks like it's , it's in our camp all the way. Texas is beyond good. We seem to be doing well all over. And that's not based on polls; that's based on numbers based on early ballots. So we're very happy with it. And I think Michigan is plus-two; it just came out. We're plus-two in Michigan. We are , we're really doing incredibly well. Does anybody have any questions?",

I JUST WANT TO SAY A SPECIAL THANKS BEFORE I GO MUCH FURTHER TO MY FRIEND. YOUR SENATOR, TIM KAINE, A TEACHER'S SON, AN IRONWORKER'S SON, A GUY WHO, IN FACT, AS LAWYER WHO FOUGHT FOR PEOPLE HIS WHOLE LIFE, HE'S A GOVERNOR WHO I'M PROUD TO HAVE TIM IN THIS FIGHT WITH ME BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE I WOULD RATHER HAVE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK A FEW MORE OUTSTANDING PUBLIC SERVANTS. CONGRESSMAN DONALD , HE'S BEEN WITH ME A LONG TIME. WHERE ARE YOU? DON, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IF I'M YOUR NOMINEE IT'S ALL DON'S FAULT. HE'S BEEN PUSHING ME TO DO THIS FOR A LONG TIME. HE'S BEEN WITH ME FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR IT, DON. I REALLY MEAN IT. I CALL HER COMMANDER , I CAME DOWN AND CAMPAIGNED FOR HER AND SHE WON IN SPITE OF IT. SHE WAS WINNING BY 20 POINTS, SHE STILL WON AFTER I CAMPAIGNED FOR HER. I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU'RE DOING A HECK OF A JOB, COMMANDER, AND YOU HELPED US WIN BACK THE HOUSE IN 2018. AND THE GUY WHO HAS FORGOTTEN MORE ABOUT REFORMING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE THAN MOST PEOPLE WILL EVER KNOW, CONGRESSMAN BOBBY SCOTT. BOBBY HAS BEEN A GREAT FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. WE SERVED IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE TOGETHER, AND, BOBBY, I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU'LL BE IN TROUBLE BECAUSE THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO WHEN I GET ELECTED PRESIDENT, GOD WILLING, IS I'M GOING TO SIGN INTO LAW YOUR SAFE JUSTICE ACT WHICH WILL CHANGE A LOT OF THINGS. NO, FOR REAL. YOU KNOW IT. YOU KNOW IT. AND, FOLKS, MAYOR , WHERE ARE YOU? THANK YOU, MAN. THE PASSPORT INTO THE PLACE. RICHMOND IS A DIFFERENT PLACE BECAUSE OF YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH ME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENDORSEMENT. AND GOVERNOR TERRY MCAULIFFE. IT THIS IS A GUY WHO HAS BEEN A LEADER, WHO FOUGHT FOR PROGRESSIVE CHANGE, THAT WHEN I STARTED OFF, HE WAS A UNITED STATES SENATOR, I GOT ELECTED WHEN I WAS 29 YEARS OLD, BACK 180 YEARS AGO, VIRGINIA WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE IDEA THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD FIND A WAY THROUGH GETTING TO THE PRESIDENCY, IS THROUGH VIRGINIA. I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU AND TIM HAVE CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE HERE. YOU HAVE CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF THE COUNTRY AND HERE'S THE DEAL. TO ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED OUT, LEFT BEHIND, THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. SIX DAYS AGO THE PRESS AND THE PUNDITS DECLARED MY CANDIDACY DEAD. NOW, THANKS TO THE HEART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN SOUTH CAROLINA, I'M VERY MUCH ALIVE. AND, YOU KNOW, THE INTERESTING THING IS, THAT ON TUESDAY, HERE IN VIRGINIA, YOU COULD BE THE LAUNCHING PAD TO THE PATH TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP. YOU KNOW, THIS CAMPAIGN HAS TAKEN OFF, SO I ASK Y'ALL, I ASK Y'ALL TO JOIN US, AND ANYBODY WATCHING THIS ON TELEVISION, I WANT TO TELL YOU, GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM. SIGN UP. VOLUNTEER. CONTRIBUTE IF YOU CAN. WE NEED YOU AND WE'LL USE YOU AND WE'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL YOUR HELP. THERE IS A PLACE IN OUR CAMPAIGN FOR YOU. FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS DEMOCRATS ALL ACROSS THE NATION AND HERE IN VIRGINIA WILL BE VOTING ON SUPER TUESDAY. THE MOMENT TO CHOOSE THE PATH FORWARD FOR OUR PARTY HAS ARRIVED. MAYBE SOONER THAN MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD. MAYBE SOONER THAN THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BUT IT'S HERE AND THE DECISION DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO MAKE ACROSS AMERICA IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL DETERMINE WHAT OUR PARTY STANDS FOR, WHAT WE BELIEVE IN, AND WHAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET DONE. IF DEMOCRATS WANT TO NOMINATE SOMEONE WHO CAN BEAT TRUMP, KEEP NANCY PELOSI AS SPEAKER, HOLD THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND TAKE BACK THE U.S. SENATE, THE STATE LEGISLATURE, LIKE WE DID IN VIRGINIA, IF THEY WANT TO DO THAT, IF THEY WANT TO DO THAT, NOW IS THE MOMENT. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS, THE DECISION THE DEMOCRATS MAKE ALL ACROSS AMERICA IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL DETERMINE, AS I SAID WHAT WE STAND FOR. AND, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF DEMOCRATS WANT A NOMINEE WHO WILL BUILD ON OBAMA CARE, NOT SCRAP IT. IF THEY WANT TO TAKE ON THE NRA AND NOT PROTECT THEM, IF THEY WANT TO STAND UP FOR THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS, WELL, FOLKS, WE'VE ARRIVED AT THAT MOMENT. THAT'S THE CHANGE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO STAND UP AND MAKE SURE THE MIDDLE CLASS DOESN'T HAVE TO RAISE THEIR TAXES, AND YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO MAKES A PROMISE THAT CAN BE KEPT, THEN JOIN US. AND IF DEMOCRATS WANT, IF DEMOCRATS WANT TO BUILD A COALITION AND A LEGACY OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRAT IN OUR LIFETIME, BARACK OBAMA , CHEERS] YOU CAN DO THIS, WE CAN DO THIS BY BUILDING A COALITION, WE CAN DO THIS BY BRINGING TOGETHER AMERICANS OF EVERY RACE, EVERY ETHNICITY, EVERY GENDER, EVERY ECONOMIC STATION, REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS AS WELL AS INDEPENDENTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS RACE IS BIGGER THAN JUST THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE CHARACTER OF AMERICA IS ON THE BALLOT. LITERALLY. YOU CAN EITHER WIN BIG OR LOSE BIG. I SAID WINNING BIG OR LOSING BIG, THAT'S THE CHOICE. MOST AMERICANS DON'T WANT THE PROMISE OF A REVOLUTION. WHAT THEY WANT IS RESULTS. RESULTS. THEY WANT TO GIVE ALL AMERICANS ACCESS TO REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE AVAILABLE FOR EVERY AMERICAN. AN ENVIRONMENT WITH CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER, AND AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT FUNDS OUR SCHOOLS, PAYS OUR TEACHERS, AND MAKES SURE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS FREE, A NATION THAT'S ABLE TO STAND UP SUCCESSFULLY TO THE NRA, REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND MOBILIZE THE WORLD AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. AND AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. A JOB, AS MY DAD USED TO SAY, IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT'S ABOUT WHO YOU ARE. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE, AFTER HAVING LOST A JOB, IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, WE HAD TO MOVE TO DELAWARE. IT TOOK THREE YEARS TO BE ABLE TO BUY ANOTHER HOME, BUT HE WOULD SAY, IT MEANS WHO YOU ARE. BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. MY DAD LIKE MANY OF YOURS MADE THAT LONGEST WALK, UP A SHORT SLIGHT OF STAIRS TO A KID'S BEDROOM AND SAY, HONEY, DAD LOST HIS JOB, MOM LOST HER JOB, WE CAN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO MAKE THIS WALK. WE CAN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE. YOU'RE GOING TO GO HOME AND LIVE WITH GRANDPA AND MOM IS GOING TO AND YOUR BROTHERS ARE GOING TO GO HOME, TOO BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. YOUR SISTER. BUT I'M GOING TO MOVE DOWN TO DELAWARE. IT'S ONLY 157 MAILS AWAY. I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE GOING TO THE MOON WHEN HE SAID IT. NO, I REALLY DID, SO I CAME HOME EVERY WEEKEND. AND WHEN I GET IT PUT TOGETHER IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY, I PROMISE YOU. MY DAD BELIEVED IT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS AN EVEN CHANCE IF HE WORKED LIKE HELL HE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY BUT GO BACK TO YOUR OLD NEIGHBORHOODS, ASK THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THAT WALK TODAY, ASK THEM WHO THEY THINK THEY CAN LOOK THEIR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY AND MEAN IT. THE TRUTH IS, WE HAVE NOW NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD, THE POOR ARE GETTING KILLED. WE'RE IN A POSITION WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE RECEIVE A BILL FOR $400 PER MONTH THEY DIDN'T EXPECT, GUESS WHAT, THEY WOULD HAVE TO BORROW THE MONEY OR SELL SOMETHING. FOLKS, THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT'S NOT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE , THAT'S NOT WHERE WE'VE BEEN OR HAVE TO BE. LOOK, I'M IN THIS FOR ALL OUR FAMILIES. FOR ALL OUR COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THAT'S WHAT MAKES US DEMOCRATS. TALK IS CHEAP. FALSE PROMISES ARE DECEPTIVE. THE TALK OF REVOLUTION ISN'T CHANGING ANYONE'S LIFE RIGHT NOW. THE FACT IS, YOU NEED REAL RESULTS AND WE NEED THEM NOW. THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE MY WHOLE CAREER AND I'LL DO IT AS PRESIDENT. IT ISN'T AN ELECTION TO SPENDS OUR TIME IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THAT'S GOING TO BE DETERMINED BY ALL OF YOU. BUT WE'RE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. THIS IS THE MOST PERILOUS MOMENT IN THE LIFETIME OF ANYONE HERE IN TERMS OF POLITICS. YOU'VE NEVER VOTED IN AN ELECTION, NO MATTER HOW OLD YOU ARE, THAT'S MORE CONSEQUENTIAL THAN WHERE WE ARE NOW. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER IN MY BEING, THAT WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, I ANNOUNCED MY CANDIDACY UP IN PHILADELPHIA. WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA. NOT SELLING MORE DIVISION. IT MEANS NOT ONLY FIGHTING BUT HEALING THIS COUNTRY. YOU'VE GOT TO HEAL IT. WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BUT WE CAN'T BECOME LIKE THEM. WE CAN'T BECOME THEM. I GET CRITICIZED IN THIS CAUCUS IN THIS DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, FOR TALKING ABOUT, WE'RE NOT , WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ENDLESS WAR. FOLKS, SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK WITH ENDLESS WAR BETWEEN THE PARTIES. IF THAT HAPPENS, THAT CONTINUES, I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE CAN'T BRING IT TOGETHER BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T ALL THAT'S LEFT, ALL THAT'S LEFT IS THE ABUSE OF POWER BY A PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE. IT'S NOT AT ALL CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONSTITUTION. FOLKS, LOOK, WE MUST HEAL OUR DIVISIONS AND REPAIR THIS DEMOCRACY AND ABOVE ALL, IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO GET BACK UP, AND ONCE AGAIN, FIGHT FOR THE PROPOSITION, AS CORNY AS I SOUNDS, THE PROPOSITION, THE TRUTH IS SO SELF EVIDENT, WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR. WE, THE PEOPLE, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION, LOOK, LOOK, WE'VE NEVER LIVED UP TO THOSE WORDS OF JEFFERSON, BUT WE HAVE NEVER, NEVER, NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THEM. LIKE WE HAVE UNDER THIS PRESIDENT. I BELIEVE THOSE WORDS WITH EVERY FIBER IN MY BEING. I SAW A FEW DAYS AGO IN A TOWN HALL ON CNN IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, YOU KNOW, A GENTLEMAN SPOKE UP OR REVEREND, HE STOOD UP AND HE ASKED ME A QUESTION IN THAT TOWN HALL, HIS NAME IS REVEREND ANTHONY THOMPSON, WHOSE WIFE MYRA, WAS STUDYING THE WORDS OF HER BIBLE WITH EIGHT OTHER PARISHIONERS, WITH MOTHER EMANUEL 4 1/2 YEARS AGO. IT WAS THEIR WEEKLY BIBLE STUDY. AND, YOU KNOW, A WHITE SUPREMACIST WALKED IN, THEY WERE TRYING TO FIND PURPOSE IN FAITH AND IN GOD AND IN EACH OTHER. AND IN AN INSTANT, IN AN INSTANT, WHAT HAPPENED. HATE'S VENGEANCE PIERCED THEIR FAITH. THEY ARE LOST FOREVER. ONCE MOST INCREDIBLE ABOUT THAT CONGREGATION, WHAT'S MOST REMARKABLE, IS REVEREND THOMPSON AND THE FAMILIES OF EMMANUEL NINE IS THAT THROUGH THEIR PAIN AND GRIEF, THEY FOR GAVE. REMEMBER, THEY FORGAVE THE KILLER, AND IN THEIR FORGIVENESS, MORE CHANGE, MORE CHANGE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO SOUTH CAROLINA THAN IN THE PAST HUNDRED YEARS. THE CONFEDERATE FLAG CAME DOWN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT. FOR REAL. BASICALLY SHAMED THE LEGISLATURE IN DOING THE RIGHT THING. AND REAL CHANGE BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE. THAT WAS SIX WEEKS AFTER MY SON BO BIDEN HAD JUST DIED. AFTER A LONG, LONG ILLNESS. AND MY WIFE AND MY SON AND DAUGHTER AND I, WE STAYED DOWN ANOTHER TWO DAYS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE SUNDAY SERVICE AT MOTHER EMMANUEL. AFTER THE FUNERALS HAD ALREADY TAKEN PLACE AND THE MEMORIAL SERVICE HAD ENDED. BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO HEAL. WE NEEDED TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE, WHERE WE, THE FAMILY, COULD FIND THE KIND OF PEACE. GOD KNOWS HOW THEY FOUND IT. FOLKS, WE WENT BACK TO THAT CHURCH AND WITH EVERY DAY THAT'S PASSED, EVERY SEASON THAT'S PASSED, THEY HAVE GOTTEN UP AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET UP, BECAUSE WE LEARNED, AND I'M NOT PROSELYTIZING, I'M NOT TRYING TO CONTINUE ANY PARTICULAR FAITH, BUT IT WAS FAITH THAT GOT US BACK UP. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THIS. BUT EVERY DAY, EVERY SEASON THAT'S PASSED, YOU KNOW, WHAT I LEARNED, AND A LOT OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH AS MUCH OR WORSE THAN I HAVE BEEN THROUGH IN YOUR FAMILY LIFE, LOSING CHILDREN AND A WIFE AND THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT , BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU FIND OUT WHAT I FOUND, AND THAT'S WHY I WENT BACK TO THE CHURCH, I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS, BACK TO THEIR CHURCH, IS THAT I FOUND THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH REAL LOSS IS TO FIND PURPOSE. TO FIND PURPOSE. AND TO DO THINGS THAT ARE WORTHY OF THE BLESSINGS TO LIVE IN THIS REMARKABLE COUNTRY AND THE THINGS THAT YOU HOPE AND PRAY, THAT WHAT YOU LOST WOULD BE PROUD OF YOU FOR DOING. HOW MANY IN THIS ROOM, IN THIS GYMNASIUM, HAVE LOST A CHILD, MOTHER, FATHER, BROTHER, SISTER, LOOK AROUND, ANYWHERE FROM HALF TO 2/3 OF THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT WORSE THAN I HAVE BEEN THROUGH WITHOUT ANY KIND OF HELP FROM THE FAMILY THAT I HAD. MY POINT IS. YOU'RE THE REASON I'M IN THIS RACE. PEOPLE LIKE YOU HERE TONIGHT AND ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE THE DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP'S DIVISIVENESS HAS TO COME TO AN END. WITH NO APATHY, NO CONCERN, NO ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. THEY HAVE TO END. BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THE ALTERNATIVE. THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THIS. THEY NOW KNOW, THEY NOW KNOW, THERE ARE TWO WAYS PEOPLE GET INSPIRED. BY INSPIRATIONAL LEADERS FROM LINCOLN ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO OBAMA, OR BY REALLY BAD PEOPLE. BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY SENSE OF DECENCY AND HONOR AND COMPASSION. GUESS WHAT? THE DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP HAVE, IN FACT, MADE PEOPLE REALIZE WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS. WE HAVE TO BUILD A MORE PERFECT UNION BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THE ALTERNATIVE. SO MY MESSAGE TO YOU IS SIMPLE. FOLKS, LET'S GET BACK UP. WE'RE DECENT, BRAVE, RESILIENT PEOPLE. WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS MOMENT AND WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS PRESIDENT. SO GET UP. LET'S TAKE THE COUNTRY BACK. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE HAVE NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER FAILED WHEN WE'VE SET OUR MIND TO IT AND DONE IT TOGETHER. I MEAN THIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. IT'S TIME TO GET UP, TAKE BACK THE COUNTRY, AND LEAD THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.",

I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SOMETHING ELSE. I DO IT IN YOU DO IT AND WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO WANT TO DO IT AND THEY WANTED TO DO IT FOR YEARS BUT THEY HAVEN'T. WE PUT AMERICA FIRST AND WERE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST AGAIN, FOLKS. THIS IS TRULY AN ORDINARY TIME FOR OUR NATION. AMERICA IS DRIVING, OPTIMISM IS BOOMING AND OUR PEOPLE ARE PROSPERING AND OUR COUNTRY IS WINNING AGAIN. WINNING, WINNING, WINNING AGAIN WE ARE WINNING LIKE NEVER BEFORE AND DOING GREAT AND RESPECTED AGAIN ALL OVER THE WORLD THEY RESPECT US AGAIN. THEY WEREN'T SO RESPECTFUL FOR A LONG NUMBER OF YEARS BUT THEY RESPECT US AGAIN AS A COUNTRY AND AMERICA'S ECONOMY , IT IS NOW THE ENVY OF THE WORLD AND SINCE THE ELECTION WE'VE ADDED 6 MILLION JOBS INCLUDING HALF A MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS. REMEMBER? YOU NEVER BE ABLE AND PAST ADMINISTRATIONS AND YOU NEED A MAGIC WAND WILL BE HAVE 500,000 ALREADY ADDED IN A LOT COMING BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF COMPANIES MOVING IN AND A LOT OF MANUFACTURER JOBS. THEY SAID THAT CANNOT BE DONE BUT WE DID IT VERY EASILY AND HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. NEARLY 7 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF FOOD STAMPS AND WE ARE GETTING AMERICANS OFF OF WELFARE AND BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE WHERE THEY WANT TO BE. UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOW AT THE LOWEST RATE IN OVER 31 YEARS. THINK OF THAT. IT WILL SOON BE BREAKING THAT RECORD AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC AMERICAN, ASIAN-AMERICAN ON EMPLOYMENT OF ALL REACHED THE LOWEST RATES EVER RECORDED IN HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND THAT IS PRETTY GOOD. WAGES ARE RISING AND THEY ARE GROWING FAST WHICH MAKES ME VERY HAPPY. LISTEN TO THIS ONE. FAST IS PROPORTIONATELY FOR BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS. IT'S GREAT. THEY ARE DOING THE BEST. OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS COMPANIES ARE EXPECTED TO HIRE WORKERS AT THE FASTEST PACE IN MORE THAN A DECADE WITH THE GREATEST GAINS FOR WORKERS RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDWEST. DID YOU KNOW THAT? YOU HAD THE GREATEST GAINS ANYPLACE IN THE COUNTRY. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION DELIVERED LOW WAGES, ECONOMIC STAGNATION AND RAMPANT OFF SHORING, COUNTRIES DO NOT RESPECT WHAT WE WERE ALL ABOUT. THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF OUR COUNTRY AND TOOK OUR JOBS AND TOOK OUR BUSINESSES AND TOOK EVERYTHING AND ALL COMING BACK AND COMING BACK VERY FAST. WE'VE TURNED IT ALL AROUND WITH JOBS AND WEALTH THEY ARE NOW GOING BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY AT HEART OF OUR ECONOMIC REVIVAL IS THE LARGEST PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE HAVE THE GREATEST TAX CUTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT IN THE VILLAGE WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, THE WORST THING IN OBAMACARE WHERE YOU PAID A FORTUNE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF NOT PAYING FOR HORRIBLE HEALTHCARE. VERY UNPOPULAR, GOT RID OF IT. I GOT RID OF IT. WE ALSO GOT A THING CALLED THE BIGGEST DRILLING SITE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD IN ALASKA AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRILLING SITES BUT MAYBE THE BIGGEST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD TRYING TO GET IT TO RONALD REAGAN AND NOT ABLE TO GET IT BUT WE GOT IT APPROVED AND IT'S DONE AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT. WE ELIMINATED THE UNFAIR ESTATE TAX ALSO KNOWN AS THE DEATH TAX ON SMALL FARMS AND RANCHES AND BUSINESSES SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP THEM IN THE FAMILY. IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN YOU CAN KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY BUT IF YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR CHILDREN WHAT I JUST GOT YOU DOES NOT MEAN A DAMN THING. DON'T BOTHER. ONLY GET IT IF YOU LOVE THEM. GIVE IT TO CHARITY INSTEAD. THE HELL WITH THE KIDS. ISN'T IT A BIT THING? SO MANY PEOPLE ARE LOSING AND THEY WANT TO LEAVE THE FARM OR RANCH OR BUSINESS AND WANT TO LEAVE IT AND THEY WANT TO LEAVE IT TO THEIR CHILDREN BUT CANNOT DO IT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE LEFT IN IT HAVE TO BORROW A FORTUNE TO PAY THE TAXES SO NOW YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE TAXES. CHILDREN, CONGRATULATIONS, PARENTS, CANNOT BE AROUND TO WORRY ABOUT IT TOO MUCH ANYMORE. CONGRATULATIONS. WE CUT A RECORD NUMBER OF JOBS KILLING REGULATIONS AND NO ADMINISTRATION HAS EVER CUT REGULATIONS LIKE THAT. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION WAGED A REGULATORY ASSAULT ON THE AMERICAN FARMERS AND YOU KNOW THAT. THAT WAS AN ASSAULT, AND INVASION IN THOSE DAYS ARE OVER AND THOSE REGULATIONS ARE NOW GONE. WE'VE ALSO ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY IN THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BY FAR. LAST YEAR WE EXPORTED A RECORD AMOUNT OF ETHANOL. DOES EVERYONE LIKE ETHANOL? THEY ARE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB IN IOWA AND NEBRASKA AND OTHER PLACES WITH ETHANOL. WE ARE UNDOING DECADES OF CALAMITOUS TRADE POLICIES AND REVERSING EIGHT PAINFUL YEARS OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER. WE HAVE SURRENDERED BUT WERE NOT SURRENDERING IF YOU READ THE PAPERS ALTHOUGH MUCH OF IT IS BIG NEWS BUT THAT IS OKAY. YOU GET THE GIST OF IT. NO SURRENDER AND WE JUST DID A WONDERFUL DEAL ON THE BORDER WITH MEXICO AND IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN DOING A JOB WITH CHINA AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WITH CHINA AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WE JUST OPEN UP JAPAN FOR CATTLE AND DIFFERENT THINGS IN JAPAN THE MARKET WAS TOTALLY CLOSED BUT WE OPENED AND I WE HAVE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES OPENING UP AND IF YOU LOOK AT CANADA WERE CHARGING 285% FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS OR MATERIALS OF 285% BUT NO ONE KNEW THAT BUT WE KNEW THAT AND ESSENTIALLY THAT'S A BARRIER FOR ME NOT TO DOWN AND AGAIN WE GOT THE U.S. MCA THAT WILL BE FANTASTIC AND GOT TO GET IT APPROVED SO CALL THOSE DEMOCRATS WANT TO VOTE BECAUSE IT WILL BE PHENOMENAL FOR YOUR STATE AND PHENOMENAL FOR THE FARMERS AND MANUFACTURERS AND FRIENDLY, FOR THE UNIONS AND GREAT FOR EVERYBODY IN THE ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IN WHICH FOREIGN ASIANS AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR NATION AND NOT ONLY THE PREVIOUS MINISTRATION FOR MANY ADMINISTRATIONS BEFORE THEM ALLOWED FOREIGN NATIONS TO PLUNDER OUR COUNTRY, STEAL OUR JOBS AND TO TAKE OUR WEALTH AND IT'S ALL COMING BACK. DID YOU NOTICE? IT'S ALL COMING BACK. WE ARE ENDING THE RAMPANT THEFT OF AMERICAN JOBS, KNOCKING DOWN BARRIERS TO AMERICAN FARMERS AND OPENING BRAND-NEW MARKETS FOR AMERICAN AGRICULTURE. BUT DESPITE OUR AMAZING SUCCESS THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN ANGRIER. THEY ARE SO ANGRY. DID YOU EVER SEE A PEOPLE SO ANGRY? FOR WHAT? THESE ARE ANGRY PEOPLE. EVERY DAY THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE UNHINGED AND MORE AND MORE EXTREME. THEY ARE GOING CRAZY. DO YOU LOVE IT? THEY CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT EVERYDAY. THEY WAITED FOR THE MUELLER REPORT AND THEY WERE WAITING AND I WAS THERE GUIDE AND YOUR 18 ANGRY DEMOCRATS ALL DEMOCRATS MANY OF THEM CONTRIBUTED TO CROOKED HILLARY AND THESE WERE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE LOOKING AT ME WITH NO COLLUSION AND HAD NO COLLUSION BUT LEADING TO NO OBSTRUCTION, NO NOTHING AND NOW THEY SAY CAN WE HAVE A DO OVER? KNOW. WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM A DO OVER. THEY ARE PLAYING GAMES. MORE THAN 100 DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS SIGNED UP FOR THE BERNIE SANDERS GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTHCARE WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM HAVE. WE HAVE 180 MILLION AMERICANS HAVING GREAT PRIVATE HEALTHCARE AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT AND THAT WOULD ALL BE TAKEN AWAY. DEMOCRATS ALSO SUPPORT THE 100 TRILLION-DOLLAR GREEN NEW DEAL, HOW ABOUT THAT BEAUTY? GREEN NEW DEAL. CONCEIVED AND MADE UP BY A YOUNG WOMAN WHO IS , WELL, LET'S SEE HOW SHE WORKS OUT. IT WOULD TOTALLY DESTROY THE AMERICAN ECONOMY OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S NOT BAD. THEY THINK THEY CAN DO IT FOR 100 TRILLION BUT ACCORDING TO IF YOU GO BY THAT RULE EVERY SINGLE BILL BUILDING IN YORK WOULD HAVE TO BE RIPPED DOWN AND REBUILT AS A DIFFERENT BUILDING. BUILDINGS IN NEW YORK YOU WOULD NOT HAVE WINDOWS. WOULD ANYONE LIKE THAT? A BUILDING WITHOUT WINDOWS. I THINK THAT WILL BE PRETTY. GREEN NEW DEAL. REAL PRETTY. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. I DON'T WANT TO GO TO STRONG TONIGHT. WE WON'T TALK ABOUT IT. I WANT TO RUN AGAINST THEM SO BADLY. LIKE THEY FLIP THESE POLICIES SO QUICKLY. IT'S TRUE. BASED UPON THESE POLICIES SO QUICKLY. EVERYBODY FORGETS THAT YOU GO FROM ONE THING FOR A LIFETIME AND FLIP AND GO TO SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT THE OPPOSITE AND THEN THEY FLIP BACK BUT DEPENDS ON WHICH RACE THEY ARE RUNNING IN BUT THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS REALLY NOW THE SOCIALIST PARTY AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE MAINSTREAM. TOTALLY OUT OF TOUCH. THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS WHICH BRINGS CRIME, DRUGS FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN VIRTUALLY EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT IN THE COUNTRY NOW SUPPORTS TAXPAYER-FUNDED ABORTION RIGHT UP UNTIL BIRTH AND HOW ABOUT IN VIRGINIA? WERE NOT TALKING UP UNTIL BIRTH BUT THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA SAID AFTER BIRTH. THE BABY IS BORN AND YOU GENTLY WRAP THE BABY AND THEN YOU TALK TO THE MOTHER AND MAYBE THE FATHER AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL EXECUTE THE BABY. THIS BABY IS BORN. THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY LIFE IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. THANK YOU. YOU BETTER GET OUT AND VOTE. THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU. BUSINESSES WILL BE TAKEN AWAY, TAXES WILL BE QUADRUPLED, BETTER GET OUT AND VOTE. VERY SERIOUS THING HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY. WE NEVER DONE BETTER AND IT'S REALLY EASY AS A SOCIALIST TO SAY WHEN YOU DO WELL LET'S DO THIS AND WILL TAKE THIS AND GIVE YOU FREE THIS BUT NOTHING IS FREE. YOU ARE PAYING FOR. THERE IS NOTHING FREE. THEY WILL DESTROY THIS COUNTRY WILL BE ANOTHER VENEZUELA. THAT COUNTRY WAS REALLY WEALTHY 15 YEARS AGO BUT HAVE DESTROYED THAT COUNTRY AND I LOOK AT IT EVERY DAY. WERE STUDYING VENEZUELA AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT COUNTRY IS BEYOND BELIEF, TRULY A WEALTHY COUNTRY AND THEY DON'T HAVE WATER THEY DON'T HAVE FOOD. THEY DON'T HAVE HOSPITALS AND IT'S INCREDIBLE. DON'T LET IT HAPPEN TO US. THAT IS WHY I PASSED CONGRESS IN ONE CASE IN IT SO IMPORTANT TO PROHIBIT ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT WE JUST CAN'T HAVE BUT WANT TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION. WE HAVE TO DO IT. EVEN A LOT OF DEMOCRATS AGREE WITH US ON THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE AGREE WITH US ON THAT. THAT'S WHY I OPPOSE ANY EFFORT TO USE TAXPAYER HARD EARNED DOLLARS TO SUBSIDIZE THE ABORTION INDUSTRY. NOWHERE HAVE THE DEMOCRAT PARTY BECOME MORE DANGEROUS OR MORE RADICAL THAN ON BORDER SECURITY. CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT'S GOING ON? THEY KNOW IT'S WRONG. BUT THEY DO THIS AND THINK IT'S GOOD POLITICALLY BUT I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE POLITICALLY. THEY ARE HURTING THEMSELVES POLITICALLY? RIGHT NOW MEXICO IS DOING MORE FOR BORDER SECURITY THAN THE DEMOCRATS. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? DO YOU BELIEVE THIS? IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS. YOU PROBABLY HAVE NOTICED OVER THE LAST THREE DAYS WHAT HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO THE BORDER IN MEXICO. I WANT TO THANK MEXICO. THE TARIFFS WERE IMPORTANT BUT THEY STEPPED UP AFTER MANY YEARS STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE AND THE PRESIDENT IS A GREAT GENTLEMAN AND WE HAD A GREAT TALK OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND MET WITH THEIR PEOPLE AND WE HAVE THINGS WE NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE AND WE GOT THINGS WE NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. IT WILL BE A BIG DIFFERENCE AND WERE BUILDING A WALL THAT IS STARTING OR STARTED A WHILE AGO. BY NEXT YEAR AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE WILL HAVE CLOSE TO 500 MILES OF WALL BUT NOW ARE BEING SUED BY EVERYBODY BUT DID YOU SEE WE WON THE LAWSUIT LAST WEEK? WE WANT A BIG LAWSUIT ON THE WALL. WE WON A LAWSUIT ON THE WALL, KIM, HOW ABOUT THAT? I CELEBRATE ALL NIGHT FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND THEN WENT BACK TO WORK. THIS REALLY IS THE DEFINING ISSUE OF 2020. WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION DEMOCRATS NO LONGER REPRESENT AMERICAN CITIZENS. WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM? ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS IS ABOUT FOUR TOTALLY OPEN BORDERS AND ALL EQUALS A MASSIVE COST AND EQUALS MASSIVE CRIME AND IT EQUALS THINGS THAT NOBODY CAN BELIEVE. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING. THE PROBLEMS WITH DISEASE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. PEOPLE SAY DON'T SAY THAT, THAT'S NOT NICE BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE BUT THE DISEASE AND THE PROBLEMS COMING IN AND IT'S A VERY SAD SITUATION. CALIFORNIA WANTS TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY AND THEY WILL END UP QUADRUPLING IN SIZE IN TWO MONTHS IF THEY DON'T BE CAREFUL. IT'S CRAZY WHAT'S HAPPENING. WHAT'S HAPPENING FOLKS, IS CRAZY. WE WILL BRING IT BACK IN THE PARTY BROUGHT BACK TO RATIONALITY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SANCTUARY CITY'S AND LOOK AT THE TREMENDOUS , THEY WANT TO GET RID OF I.C.E. I.C.E. IS THE ONE THAT GOES IN AND THEY GO IN AND THEY WILL ATTACK SOME OF THE WORST CRIMINALS IN THE WORLD LIKE MS 13 AND CHOP PEOPLE UP AND CUT PEOPLE DOWN AND LIKE NICE BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE PAINFUL THAN A BULLET. BUT THEY HAVE DONE TO YOUNG WOMEN AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE TWO MEN AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO EVERYBODY AND WHAT WE'VE DONE AND TO THEM IT'S JUST ANOTHER DAY AT THE OFFICE BECAUSE THEY ARE TOUGHER AND STRONGER AND PATRIOTS BUT THEY ARE MENTALLY GREAT AND THEY WILL GO AGAINST SOME REAL DEVIANCE AND TAKING THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND BRING THEM OUT BY THE THOUSANDS AND GETTING THEM OUT. DEMOCRATS WANT TO GET RID OF I.C.E. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? WE WILL NOT HAVE IT. IOWA WILL NOT HAVE IT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO FALL FOR THAT BUT I WANT TO SAY I.C.E. AND THE BORDER PATROL , BORDER PATROL HAS APPREHENDED OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS NOT THE BIGGEST IN 15, 16, 17 YEARS THEY ARE APPREHENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE A MONTH BUT NOW THAT SHOULD START SLOWING DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY BECAUSE MEXICO'S SENDING 6000 TROOPS TO THE BORDER AND NO ONE THOUGHT THAT WOULD HAPPEN BUT IT'S A GREAT THING THAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE TO WORK AND WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE TO RUN AND A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A VOTE FOR SAFE FAMILY, SAFE COMMUNITIES AND STRONG BORDERS. WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME TO OUR COUNTRY BUT THEY HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY AND COME IN THROUGH MARRIAGE. WE WANT PEOPLE THAT CAN HELP US AND HAVE TO COME IN THROUGH MARRIAGE SO WE WILL PROBABLY GET THAT AT SOME POINT I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE THAT FAR INTO THE FUTURE. WE BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT CRIMINAL ALIENS. WE ARE JOINED IN HONOR TONIGHT TO BE WITH A VERY SPECIAL WOMAN, ANGEL MOM, I LOVE ANGEL MOMS. GREAT PEOPLE. THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN SO HORRIBLY HURT BUT MICHELLE IS A SPECIAL WOMAN WHOSE PRECIOUS, BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER, SARAH, WAS KILLED BY AN ILLEGAL ALIEN ONE DAY AFTER GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE WITH A 4.0 GPA, THE HIGHEST MARKS YOU CAN GET FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT WAS THE HIGHEST , HIGHEST MARKS, NUMBER ONE STUDENT IN THE CLASS. PLEASE, COME UP. PLEASE, COME UP. THANK YOU, MICHELLE. A GREAT WOMAN. AN EVEN GREATER MAN. THIS MAN GAVE US A VOICE. ANGEL FAMILIES A VOICE. NO OTHER PRESIDENT WOULD HEAR OUR STORY. I WAS FORTUNATE IF YOU WANT TO SAY FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE HIM IN THE RUNNING TO BECOME OUR PRESIDENT. A LOT OF OTHER ANGEL FAMILIES DID NOT HAVE THAT VOICE. WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD THAT VOICE FOR SARAH. SHE WAS KILLED JANUARY 31, 2016 WITH IN ONE DAY OF GRADUATING WITH A BACHELOR'S AS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID, 4.0 AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. HER KILLER WAS ECKSTEIN YEARS OLD WHEN HE CAME ACROSS THE BORDER UNACCOMPANIED ILLEGALLY AND HE KILLED MY DAUGHTER AT AGE 19 AND HAD A BLOOD ALCOHOL OF POINT TO 41, STREET RACING, HIT THE BACK OF MY DAUGHTERS SUV THAT WAS STOPPED AT A STOP LIGHT GOING 70 PLUS MILES AN HOUR. MY DAUGHTER DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE. I DO NOT , THE REASON I SPEAK OUT IS I DON'T GET SARAH BACK AT THE END OF THE DAY. I SPEAK OUT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THIS HAPPENING TO ANY OF YOU. OUR WONDERFUL PRESIDENT STANDS BY US AND DOES EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO HELP US BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT TO SEE ANOTHER FAMILY GO THROUGH WHAT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH. I THANK HIM FOR THAT AND PROUD OF HIM FOR STANDING AS STRONG AS HE HAS AGAINST THE OPPOSITION HE HAS TO FACE DAILY. I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. SO IS MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS. YOUR BEAUTIFUL GIRL IS LOOKING DOWN AT YOU RIGHT NOW AND SAY I'M PROUD OF MY MOM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOTTEN TO KNOW A LOT OF ANGEL MOMS AND DADS AND FAMILIES AND WHAT THEY ARE GONE THROUGH IS INCREDIBLE. FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. WE PROMISE TO ALWAYS REMEMBER SARAH AND FIGHT IN HER MEMORY TO PROTECT AMERICA'S CHILDREN. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND FOR BEING MY FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. A LOT OF FRIENDS. A LOT OF FRIENDS. THANK YOU. THE ANGEL MOMS ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE WHAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH, I CANNOT IMAGINE. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION NOT ONLY THREATENS PUBLIC SAFETY BUT DRAINS THE PUBLIC TREASURY AND OVERCROWDING SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS AND DEPLETING THE RESOURCES LOW INCOME AMERICANS DEPEND ON. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY JUST ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO GET FREE HEALTHCARE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHEN IT SHOULD VERY WELL BE USED ALL OF THAT MONEY TO PROVIDE HOUSING AND HOSPITALIZATION AND MEDICAL FOR THE RISING NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE THAN THE DEMOCRATIC CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO. CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT'S GOING ON THERE? PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK BY WALKING DOWN THE STREET. GETTING ACTUALLY SICK INCLUDING POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE INCREDIBLE. THE JOB ARE LAW-ENFORCEMENT DOES IS INCREDIBLE. DEMOCRATS FOR THE NEED OF ILLEGAL ALIENS BEFORE AND REPUBLICANS BELIEVE YOU MUST ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF OUR CITIZENS FIRST. WE HAVE THAT OBLIGATION. MY ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED A RULE TO ENSURE THAT OUR LIMITED SUPPLY OF PUBLIC HOUSING IS USED FOR THOSE WHO FOLLOW OUR LAWS, NOT THOSE WHO BREAK THEM. WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROVISIONS , THAT SAY THE WRONG PEOPLE CAN'T LIVE IN THIS VERY EXPENSIVE HOUSING THAT OUR GOVERNMENT BUILDS AND WE WILL FINISH THE WALL, IT'S HAPPENING, IT'S GOING UP QUICKLY AS I SAID AND WERE PROUD OF WHAT WERE DOING. WERE DOING A LOT MORE THAN WERE BEING FOUGHT AT EVERY CORNER, NO MATTER WHERE WE GO IT'S A LAWSUIT OR ANOTHER LAWSUIT AND ANOTHER LAWSUIT BUT THE INCREDIBLE THING IS THAT ALMOST EVERY DEMOCRAT JUST A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WANTED A WALL AND IT DID NOT GO BUILT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO BUILD IT BUT THEY WANTED A WALL. THEY GAVE IT UP IN ONE CASE AND HAD THEM ALL SET AND GAVE IT BACK. A YEAR LATER OR TWO YEARS LATER BUT HE WANTED A WALL AND WITHOUT THAT IT'S JUST A VERY TOUGH SITUATION ALTHOUGH NOW I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP GREATLY BUT EVERY DAY ITS PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT AND THAT'S A GREAT BIG OBLIGATION. VERY BIG OBLIGATION. THANKS TO ALL HER BOLD INITIATIVE TO BRING DOWN THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THEY WENT DOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 52 YEARS. WE PASSED IN THE VA WE PASSED THE A CHOICE, YOU KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING? THEY GET IN LINE AND WAIT FOR SEVEN DAYS AND THINK OF YOURSELVES, YOU ARE ALL SPOILED PEOPLE. IF YOU HAD TO WAIT FOR TWO HOURS YOU'D BE ANGRY AT THE DOCTOR. RIGHT? THEY WAIT FOR SEVEN DAYS. THEY WAIT FOR 12 DAYS OR TWO MONTHS AND THEN THERE BE A LINE FOREVER AND SOMETIMES THEY BE UP THERE WITH A VERY SMALL PROBLEM AND END UP BEING TERMINALLY ILL BY THE TIME THEY GOT TO A DOCTOR. WE PASSED CHOICES SO THEY HAVE A CHOICE. IF THEY HAD A WEIGHT THEY GO OUTSIDE AND GO TO A LOCAL DOCTOR PAY FOR THE DOCTOR AND OUR VETERANS FOR TAKING CARE OF BUT THE CRAZY THING IS WE SAVE MONEY I DOING THAT BUT WE SAVE A LOT OF MONEY AND EVERYBODY IS HAPPY ABOUT IT IN FOR 44 YEARS TO BE TRYING TO GET PAST AND I GOT A PASS. MY INITIATION AND A PROUD OF EVERYONE WHO WORKED ON IT AND WE PASSED ALSO ANOTHER ONE THAT WAS 45 YEARS, BA ACCOUNT ABILITY. BA ACCOUNT ABILITY. PEOPLE WHO WANTED THE VA TO BE SADISTIC AND HORRIBLE THINGS TO OUR DEBTS WHICH THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IN PRIME TIME BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT HAVE LASTED I SECOND BUT THEY WERE SADISTIC AND THE THIEVES AND ROBBING PEOPLE AND HURTING PEOPLE, OUR THAT'S. YOU CANNOT FIRE THEM. WE PASSED THROUGH THE REPUBLIC AND SENATE AND WE GOT IT DONE. WE GOT IT ALL DONE. VA ACCOUNT ABILITY TO BE A CHOICE AND VA ACCOUNT ABILITY AND I LOOK AT WHOEVER CAN TAKE ME AND SAY YOU'RE FIRED, GET OUT. YOU'RE FIRED. GET OUT. THAT'S A BIG THING. HAVING PEOPLE THEY HAD ONE CASE WHERE SOMEONE STOLE A HALF-MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY KNEW THEY WERE GUILTY AND YOU CANNOT FIRE THEM. THEY COULD PROSECUTE THEM BUT CANNOT FIRE THEM. IT'S LIKE IMPOSSIBLE TO , BRINKLEY, TO DEAL WITH UNIONS AND CIVIL SERVICE AND IT'S NOT AS EASY AS I SAY BUT 45 YEARS THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO CHANGE BUT WE CHANGE THAT ONE IN 44 YEARS FOR CHOICE WE CHANGE THAT ONE SO DONE A GREAT JOB FOR THE VETERANS AND DOING A THIS IN THE JOB AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THEM. THANK YOU. WE HAVE CONFIRMED MORE THAN 107 FEDERAL JUDGES RIGHT NOW AS I SPEAK AND WE SHOULD BE UP QUICKLY TO 145 AND THAT INCLUDES TWO OUTSTANDING SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, NEIL GORSUCH AN BRETT KAVANAUGH. BIG THING. 145 OF THE FEDERAL JUDGES IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND WERE GETTING THEM APPROVED VERY QUICKLY FOR UP TO 107 BUT NO ONE WOULD'VE BELIEVED US. I SIGNED IN ORDER TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING? WERE SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE TO BIG TECH DO NOT CENSOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE CENSORING CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT. AT OUR URGING WE ARE FINALLY SEEING MORE ATTENTION PAID TO THE NEED FOR BETTER FOREST MANAGEMENT AND I MENTIONED THE TERM WHEN I WAS IN CALIFORNIA AT THE WORST FOREST FIRES ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN. A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED IN ONE PARTICULAR AREA SO GREAT, PEOPLE SO GREAT BUT IT WAS LIKE A BLOWTORCH, 84-MILE AN HOUR WINDS AND THIS WAS THE STEEL FOR THE FEW HOUSES THAT HAD STEEL STRUCTURE IT WAS NOTED NOTED. IT WAS NOTED. HE NEVER FOUND THE PEOPLE IN IT WAS TOTAL CONSIDERATION AND I SAID YOU NEED FOREST MANAGEMENT BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THEY SMILED AND LAUGHED AND TURNED OUT I WAS RIGHT. THEY HAVE 15, 20 YEARS OF DEBRIS PILED UP ON THE FLOOR OF THE FOREST AND IT WAS SO DRY LIKE A BONE THAT IF YOU TOUCH IT WITH EVEN A CIGARETTE IT LIGHTS 100,000, 200,000 ACRES AND NOW THEY AGREE WITH ME AND CLEANING UP THE FOREST AND MAYBE YOU WILL SEE IT BUT THEY'VE NOT DONE ENOUGH WORK AT BUT IT MAKES A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE. OTHER PEOPLE COME TO ME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND SAY, SIR, YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE FORCE. WE LIVE IN A FOREST NATION AND WE ARE A FOREST NATION AND VERY INTERESTING. FINLAND, AUSTRIA, OTHERS THEY ARE IN A FOREST NATION THEY SAY. WE TAKE CARE OF OUR FORESTS. WE DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO YOU HAVE TO GET RID OF THOSE TREES WHEN THEY FALL BECAUSE WITHIN 18 MONTHS THERE LITERALLY LIKE A MATCH. WE WERE NOT DOING THAT IN FACT ENVIRONMENTALLY THEY DO NOT WANT US TO TOUCH THOSE AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS WONDERFUL, LET THEM LAY ON THE GROUND BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT. NOW YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF WORK ON THAT WHOLE SUBJECT FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT AND YOU'LL SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE. AS WE RESTORE AMERICAN STRENGTH AT HOME WE ARE ALSO RESTORING AMERICAN POWER ABROAD AND THE EIGHT-YEAR APOLOGY TO HER IS OVER. WE DON'T APOLOGIZE. WE DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA. WE STAND UP FOR AMERICA. WE NOW STAND UP FOR OUR COUNTRY AND HAVE A GREAT COUNTRY. WE HAVE A GREAT RATE COUNTRY AND STAND UP FOR IT. IN A CHANGE FROM THE PAST WE ARE PURSUING OUR INTEREST WITHOUT GETTING OUR NATION BOGGED DOWN IN ANALYST, COSTLY FOREIGN ENTANGLEMENTS AND THAT MAY CHANGE AND THERE ARE SOME BAD THINGS GOING ON OUT THERE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED LONG BEFORE THIS ADMINISTRATION AND MAYBE LONG BEFORE THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WHEN YOU LOOK AT NORTH KOREA AND IRAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER PLACES BUT I DO BELIEVE WE'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL AND DO BELIEVE WE HAVE IT UNDER CONTROL. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A LONG TIME AGO WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS COULD BE DONE SO MUCH EASIER IF IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO BUT THEY NEVER GOT IT DONE AND NEVER DID IT AND SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BUT WILL TAKE CARE OF IT FOR YOU. THANKS TO THE SKILL AND TREMENDOUS COURAGE OF OUR BRAVE WARRIORS AND THEIR ALLIES, PHTHISIS CALIPHATE HAS NOW BEEN COMPLETELY DECIMATED IN SYRIA. WE HAVE DONE THAT. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THESE ARE CRAZY PEOPLE AND THESE ARE REALLY CRAZY, SICK PEOPLE. WHEN I SAY IT'S DONE NOTHING IS NEVER DONE BUT WE TAKE IT BACK ALL THE LAND, ONE 100% OF THE LAND AND WHEN I TOOK OVER IT WAS SHOWN IN RED AND WAS A SEA OF RED AND EVERY MONTH IT WAS LESS AND LESS AND AS YOU SAW TWO MONTHS AGO COMPLETED THAT BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE DON'T WALK INTO A STORE WITH A BOMB AND BLOW UP A STORE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE STONE COLD CRAZY. NOT GOOD. NOT GOOD AT ALL. I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES. THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION GAVE 150 BILLION DOLLARS TO IRAN AND THEY GAVE 1.8 BILLION IN CASH. THINK OF THAT, 1.8 BILLION IN CASH. CASH. DON'T OVER IN AIRPLANES AND MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF CASH AND NO ONE HAS SEEN A BILLION IN CASH. THEY DID NOT EVEN HAVE ENOUGH AMERICAN MONEY IN OUR TRI-STATE AREA NEXT TO WASHINGTON WITH ALL HOW BIG IT IS THEY DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY SO THEY HAD TO GET MONEY FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TO BRING IT IN CASH AND GIVE THEM 1.8 BILLION IN CASH. WE GOT NOTHING. WE GOT A BAD DEAL, THAT'S WHAT WE GOT. WE ENDED THE DEAL AND WHEN THEY SIGNED THE DEAL THEY WERE SCREAMING DEATH TO AMERICA. DO YOU REMEMBER? THEY DON'T TALK THAT WAY ANYMORE. THEY BETTER NOT BE TALKING THAT WAY ANYMORE. AFTER DECADES OF BROKEN PROMISES WE OPEN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. MANY PRESIDENTS HAVE PROMISED WE WILL OPEN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY AND THEY CAMPAIGNED AND NEVER DID IT. BUT I DID IT AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT JUST THREE WEEKS AGO THE UNITED STATES ACKNOWLEDGED ISRAEL'S SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS, BIG THING. BIG, BIG THING. THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS AND MANY PRESIDENTS THAT THEY WOULD DO THAT BUT THEY NEVER DID. I DID IT AND IT WAS JUST FINE. GREAT THING FOR ISRAEL. IT'S A GREAT THING FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT YOU NEED THE GOLAN HEIGHTS FOR SECURITY AND PROPER SECURITY AND WE GOT IT DONE. THE OVERWHELMINGLY MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT THEIR LOGIN AGENDA OF PORTABLE CARE, SAFE JOB, LOW TAXES AND SECURE BORDERS. VERY SIMPLE. VERY SIMPLE. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE NOT ONLY IN THIS ROOM BUT ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY OPPOSED THE DEMOCRAT PLATFORM OF MASS MIGRATION, HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, LATE-TERM ABORTION AND LATER THAN LATE-TERM ABORTION HOAXES AND DELUSIONS. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY, AMERICAN WORKER, AMERICAN FARMER AND THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE BELIEVE IN THE CONSTITUTION AND THE RULE OF LAW. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK IN THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY AND ALWAYS RESPECT DEARLY OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. WE BELIEVE ALL AMERICANS SHARE ONE MAGNIFICENT DESTINY AS ONE TEAM, ONE PEOPLE IN ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD. WE FIGHT ON BEHALF OF HARD-WORKING CITIZENS WHO POUR OUT THEIR HEART AND SOUL AND SWEAT EVERY DAY TO EARN A LIVING AND TAKE YOUR OTHER FAMILY AND PAY THEIR TAXES, FOLLOW OUR LAWS, RAISE THEIR CHILDREN AND SAFEGUARD THE VALUES THAT MADE AMERICA THE GREATEST NATION EVER TO EXIST ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. AND IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW WE ARE DOING SO MUCH BETTER IN ALMOST ALWAYS THEN IT'S EVER DONE BEFORE. YOU LOOK AT OUR ECONOMY AND LOOK AT OUR MILITARY AND LOOK AT SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS WE ARE DOING BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE AND IT'S LARGELY BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND YOU WORK HARD AND YOU WORK SMART AND WORK HONESTLY AND WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THIS LAND IS YOUR HOME. THESE AMERICAN PATRIOTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LOYAL TO OUR COUNTRY AND NOW THEY ARE FINALLY HAVING A PRESIDENT WHO IS LOYAL TO THEM AND IT'S ABOUT TIME, ISN'T IT? EVERYDAY FOR THE NEXT 16 MONTHS WE WILL KEEP ON FIGHTING AND KEEP ON WORKING AND WE WILL KEEP ON WINNING. WE WILL WIN IT FOR YOU. WE WILL WIN AGAIN IN 2020. KEEP AMERICA GREAT. AND IN 2020 IOWA WILL ONCE AGAIN BE AT THE CENTER OF THE ACTION, REMEMBER I SAID WILL KEEP IOWA FIRST. REMEMBER THAT? JEFF, DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? MAC THAT WAS A BIG MOVE TO MOVE IOWA TO THE BACK OF THE LINE OR CENTER OF THE LINE BUT WE WORKED VERY HARD AND I SAID I WIN. WE ARE KEEPING IT. WERE KEEPING IT RIGHT WHERE IT IS. IT'S ALSO A GREAT TRADITION. WOULDN'T LOOK TERRIBLE IF I WHAT WAS THE 32nd NATION IN THE VOTING LINE I DON'T THINK IT WOULD LOOK TOO GOOD. JEFF, YOU WORKED HARD ON THAT AND I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. RIGHT HERE IN THE HAWKEYE STATE THE BACKYARDS AND LIVING ROOMS AND TOWN HALLS AND FAIRGROUNDS AND DINERS IN COFFEE SHOPS ALL ACROSS THE STATE YOU WILL BE THE ONES TO SHAPE AMERICA'S FUTURE AND YOU HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT STATE POLITICALLY IN A VERY IMPORTANT STATE BUT WHAT HAPPENS HERE OFTENTIMES DETERMINES WHAT HAPPENS FOR OUR COUNTRY IN TERMS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND MOST POWERFUL POSITION IN THE WORLD. YOU WILL BE THE ONES TO MAKE AMERICAN HISTORY AND YOU WILL BE ONCE AGAIN THE ONES TOO, IN A SENSE TRULY, LEAD OUR COUNTRY TO VICTORY. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PEOPLE FROM IOWA. YOU'VE BEEN VERY SPECIAL TO ME AND IT BEEN IMPORTANT PLACE AND SPECIAL TO ME. I LOVE THE PEOPLE. YOU ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. HARD-WORKING, SUCCESSFUL AND ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT PEOPLE FROM IOWA NEVER, EVER GIVE UP. YOU NEVER, EVER QUIT. THAT IS FOR SURE. I WANT TO THANK IOWA FOR BEING SO GOOD TO ME AND I WILL SAY TONIGHT, GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.",

         "HELLO, GEORGIA. HOW YOU END THE PRAYER. CAN I GET AN AMEN? THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT. I WANT TO CALL OUT TWO MEN WHO I HAD THE CHANCE TO SERVE ALONG SIDE, ONE OF MY TIME IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES AND BOTH OF THEM HAVE BEEN MEN OF INTEGRITY AND COMMITTED TO ADVANCING THE AGENDA THAT REPRESENTS THE CONSERVATIVE VALUES. JOIN ME IN THANKING CONGRESSMAN SCOTT AND CONGRESSMAN FERGUSON. THANKS FOR YOUR GREAT LEADERSHIP. AND IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH A MAN FOR MANY YEARS AND I STILL HAVE THE SAME COLOR THAT HE HAS AND ONE OF THE MOST FOUNDER OF THE FAITH AND FREEDOM COALITION AND HE IS FIGHTING TO DELIVER GEORGIA FOR OUR VALUES, THANK YOU IN TO RALPH REED. THANK YOU, MY FRIEND. WITH ALL MY FELLOW AMERICANS WHO ARE HERE, STATE FIRST, NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS, IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH ALL OF YOU. SPEAKING OF FRIENDS OF MINE, BRINGING GREETINGS. I SPOKE TO HIM AS I GOT ON AIR FORCE 2 THIS MORNING AND HE IS HEADED TO GEORGIA AND GREETINGS AND GRATITUDE FROM THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. I'M HERE BECAUSE I STAND HERE WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. AND I'M HERE BECAUSE WE STAND WITH SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER! WHY THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE IN DALTON TONIGHT AND I'M GRATEFUL TO SEE YOU COME OUT HERE TODAY AND TAKE THE FIGHT ALL ACROSS THIS STATE. AND FIGHT FOR ALL WE'VE DONE AND FIGHT FOR ALL WE HAVE YET TO DO. WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT TO SEND PERDUE AND LOEFFLER BACK TO WASHINGTON D.C. ARE YOU WITH ME? THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS AND NEED TO SEND THEM BACK TO WASHINGTON D.C. IT WOULD BE ENOUGH AND SEND THEM BACK BECAUSE OF ALL WE ACCOMPLISHED TOGETHER OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND WE NEED TO SEND THEM BACK TO WASHINGTON D.C. BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN SENATE MAJORITY COULD BE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE TO PRESERVE ALL WE HAVE DONE TO REVIVE OUR ECONOMY AND PRESERVE THE GOD-GIVEN LITS THAT WE HOLD DEAR. A FOURTH GENERATION FARM GIRL FROM THE HEARTLAND WHO MOVED DOWN HERE TO MOVE DOWN TO GAY AND BUILT A COMPANY AND BUILT BARRIERS AND BUILT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESSES AND SHE IS HE MERGING ONE OF THE MOST VOICES ON CAPITOL HILL. WE NEED SENATOR KELLEY LOEFFLER BACK IN THE SENATE. SON OF MAKEON AND WORKED HIS WAY UP TO THE TOP OF THE BUSINESS WORLD AND HE AND HIS FAMILY FELT THE CALLING AND 40 YEARS AS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS LEADERS IN AMERICA, THEY DECIDED TO STEP IN TO THE THE POLITICS AND SERVE GEORGIA AND I CAN ATTEST HAVING SERVED ALONG SIDE HIM EVERY DAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I HAVE NO MORE STALWART CHAMPION OF OUR AGENDA TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN THAN SENATOR PERDUE. WE HAVE TO SEND HIM BACK. EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THEIR STALWART SUPPORT AND THINK ABOUT IT. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT WAS HALL OOD OUT, AN ECONOMY TO STRUGGLE OUT. TRIM WAS ON THE RISE AROUND THE WORLD AND WE WITNESSED THE STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR MOST CHERISHED VALUES. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP TRUM AND GEORGIA'S TWO SENATORS, WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY AND SECURED OUR BORDER AND FOUGHT FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. AMAZING TO THINK WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND BEGINS WITH OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE. I'M YOUR VICE PRESIDENT BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT TITLE I WILL HOLD IS SPELLED D A.D. ONE OF MY UNWORTHY SON-IN-LAWS IS A NAVY PILOT. THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASE IN OUR DEFENSE. WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY AND GIVE QUEN OUR SERVICEMEN AND SPACE FORCE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DEFEND OUR NATION NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SENATOR DAVID PERDUE FROM HIS SEAT ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. YOU ALL REMEMBER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION YEARS OF SCANDAL AT THE V.A., REMEMBER? WE HAD AMERICA'S HEROES AND MANY CASES THAT WERE PASSES AWAY ON WAITING LISTS. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME INTO OFFICE, THOSE DAYS WERE OVER. WE PASSED THE MOST SWEEPING REFORM OF THE V.A. IN 50 YEARS AND VETERANS' CHOICE IS AVAILABLE FOR EVERY VETERAN IN AMERICA. AND FROM HER POSITION ON THE VETERANS' AFFAIR COMMITTEE, SENATOR LOEFFLER HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR OUR VETERANS EVERY DAY. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY IN 75 YEARS, WE CUT TAXES, WE ROLLED BACK REGULAR LIKES AND UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY AND BUSINESSES PROVIDED JOBS INCLUDING 350,000 JOBS RIGHT HERE IN THE PEACH STATE. WAGES WERE RISING ACROSS THE BOARD. WAGES WERE RAISING. THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN WERE FORGOTTEN NO MORE. TRUE. SO WE WERE MAKING EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS, THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION AND THEN 2020 ARRIVED AND THE CORONAVIRUS STRUCK FROM CHINA. WITH THE SUPPORT OF YOUR TWO SENATORS, WE LAUNCHED THE GREATEST NATIONAL MOBILIZATION SINCE WORLD WAR I 12 AND SAW THE DELIVERY OF BILLIONS OF MEDICAL OF SUPPLIES AND CREATION OF MEDICINES AND SECURED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES AND AMAZING TO THINK IN LESS THAN A YEAR WE HAVE NOT ONE BUT TWO EFFECTTIVE VACCINES THAT ARE BEING ADMINISTERED TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND GEORGIA SENATORS WERE THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND HELPED US AND AFTER WE LOST 22 MILLION JOBS AFTER THE HEIGHT OF THIS CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK. WE ARE OPENING UP GEORGIA AGAIN. WE HAVE ALREADY CONFIRMED 220 FEDERAL JUDGES AT EVERY LEVEL AND THEY ARE ALL PRINCIPLED MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL ENSIDELINE OUR GOD-GIVEN CONSTITUTION. THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. AND THE PRESIDENT NOMINATES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS BUT IT'S THE SENATE THAT CONFIRMS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT CONFIRMS. ALL THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE, NOT HAVE BEEN MADE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG UNWAVERING SUPPORT OF OUR SENATORS. THEY STOOD STRONG AND APOINTED THOSE IF I HAD JUDGES AND THEY WERE THERE WHEN WE CONFIRMED JUSTICE GORSUCH AND JUSTICE KAVANAUG HMP AND JUSTICE AMY COMB YES BARRETT. THE LAST FOUR YEARS, OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS STOOD STRONG WITH THE VALUES WE CHERISH MOST. WE REPEALED THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT BECAUSE THE FIRST AMENDMENT, FREEDOM OF SPEECH SHOULD NOT END AT THE FRONT DOOR. STOOD FOR THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY OF EVERY AMERICAN AND MADE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM A POLICY, GOALS OF OUR ADMINISTRATION ON THE WORLD STAGE. NOW YOU MAY REMEMBER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION WAS DIFFERENT. LAST ADMINISTRATION TRAMPLED ON THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES. THE COMPROMISED OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND RELIGIOUS CHARITIES. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION EVEN HAULED A GROUP OF CATHOLIC NUNS INTO FEDERAL COURT TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH TO LIVE UNDER THE FEDERAL MANDATES OF OBAMACARE. INCREDIBLE. IN FACT. WE SAW THAT RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE A FEW SHOFERT YEARS AGO WHEN JUSTICE BARRETT WENT BEFORE THE FEDERAL COURT. DO YOU REMEMBER. THE LEADING DEMOCRAT ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAID SHE WAS , FOR OUR LIBERTIES AND FOR OUR SENATE MAJORITY THAT WILL RESPECT OUR MOST CHERISHED FREEDOMS, WE NEED SENATOR PERDUE AND SENATOR LOEFFLER BACK IN A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY BACK IN THE U.S. SENATE. THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION HAVE NEVER BEEN MISHE AND THE CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER. WHEN THEY STAND FOR A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE, JON OSOFF AND REMPED WARN OFF ARE GOING TO CUT. WHEN OSOFF AND WARNOCK ARE GOING TO RAISE TAXES. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IT CALLING MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES GANGSTERS AND THUGS BECAUSE THEY CUT TAXES. AND REVEREND WARNOCK HAS CALLED ON OUR MOST ALLY AND WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF KELLY LOFFLER AND PERDUE, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NEVER DONE WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JUREM, THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOFFLER, THE WORLD WILL KNOW THIS, AMERICA STANDS WITH ISRAEL. AND WITH JON OSOFF AND RAFAEL WARN OFF, LIKE THE PARTY THEY REPUBLIC, TAXPAYER ABORTION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, I COULDN'T BE BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE ALONG SIDE THE MOST PRO-PRESIDENT. AND I AND KELLY LEFF LORE STANDS FOR THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND DAVID PERDUE. YOU KNOW WHAT THE STAKES ARE HERE IN GEORGIA. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN IN FOCUS YET, LISTEN TO WHAT CHUCK SCHUMER SAID, QUOTE, WE NOW TAKE GEORGIA AND THEN WE CHANGE AMERICA. I GOT ANOTHER MESSAGE FOR CHUCK SCHUMER. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP GEORGIA. AND WE ARE GOING TO SAVE AMERICA. AND I MENTIONED PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE IN GEORGIA LATER TODAY. AND I HEARD JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO HOLD A LITTLE RALLY OF HIS OWN. JOE BIDEN WAS IN GEORGIA, YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT. HE ACTUALLY SAID THAT GEORGIA, THESE ARE HIS WORDS, GEORGIA DOESN'T NEED TWO SENATORS, QUOTE, THAT ARE JUST GOING TO GET IN THE WAY. WELL, GEORGIA, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED IN THE UNITED STATES' SENATE. WE NEED THE SENATORS TO GET IN THE WAY OF THE RADICAL LEFT OF WASHINGTON D.C.

AND I KNOW MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE JOINING WITH YOU IN THE COURSE OF PRAYER IN THE OURS HOURS AND I WANT YOU TO ENCOURAGE PRACTICE OF PRAYER IN A RENEWED PRAYER. AS WE WORK TO DEFEND THE MAJORITY, I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO PRAY FOR THE STATE OF THIS STATE AND NATION AND PRAY WITH CONFIDENCE AND IN THOSE AINCHEPT WORDS THAT AMERICA CAPS HAVE CLUNG TO, THAT IF HIS PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLED BY HIS NAME WILL HUMBLE HIS NAME AND PRAY AND WILL DO LIKE HE HAS ALWAYS DONE IN THE LONG AND STORIED. HE WILL HEAR FROM HEAVEN AND WILL HEAL THIS LAND. SO PRAY, PRAY FOR AMERICANS. PRAY FOR ALL THE AMERICANS AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME AT ROCKS SPRINGS CHURCH AND THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. IT'S THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE TO BE YOUR VICE PRESIDENT. I WANT TO THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE. I LEAVE YOU TODAY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE ENTHUSIASM THAT I SEE AND I KNOW THE PRESIDENT WILL SEE THAT TODAY. BUT I CAN TELL ALL OF YOU THAT I WAS REMINDED RESENTLY EVEN WHEN IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY THAT GOOD GOD IS ALWAYS WORKING. I HAVE TO TELL YOU BENNY MAY APPRECIATE THIS STORY, I SHARED IT A LITTLE WHILE BACK. I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A PASTOR WHO IS FROM JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA. HE AND HIS NEW BRIDE WERE ATTENDING A CEREMONY. AS I READ THE LETTER, HE TALKED ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE THERE. AND IT WOULD HOST A CHRISTIAN MUSIC FESTIVAL AND INVITE PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE MIDWEST TO COME. THEY WOULD HAVE BANDS THAT WOULD TAKE THE STAGE OF WHAT WAS EARLY CONTEMPORARY MUSICIC. AND DECIDED THAT THE SEE HIMARY IN 1977 TO CANCEL THE EVENT. BUT HE AND HIS NEW BRIDE SAID THEY FELT A CALLING TO VOLUNTEER TO LEAD IT AND WROTE TO ME SAYING THAT QUOTE, FRIENDS TOLD US IT WOULD BE HARD ON OUR NEW MARRIAGE AND SHOULDN'T DO A YEAR-LONG PROJECT OF SETTING UP THIS FESTIVAL AND HE SAID WE ANSWERED THE CALL. WE GATHERED OTHERS TO ARRANGE THE EVENT IN 1978. HE TOLD ME THAT THE NIGHT CAME, THE CULMINATING EVENING OF SATURDAY NIGHT WHERE HE WAS WALKING THROUGH THE CAMP AREA AND IT WAS RAINING, THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED AND THOUGHT IT WAS ALL FOR NAUTH. AND HE WROTE TO ME AND HE SAID THAT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT NIGHT, A FUTURE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE GIVING HIS LIFE TO JESUS CHRIST. HE SAID, QUOTE, I CANNOT WRITE THIS WITHOUT TEARS AND I COULDN'T READ IT WITHOUT TEARS, BECAUSE I REMEMBER THAT NIGHT. SITTING ON A HILLSIDE, IT WAS RAINING AND IT WAS LIKE I HEARD THE WORDS FOR THE FIRST TIME. GOD FILL UP THE WORLD THAT HE SENT HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON MIGHT VERY ETERNAL LIFE. AND I STOOD UP, 18 YEARS YOUNG AND I WALKED DOWN THAT NIGHT, NOT OUT OF A SENSE OF NEWLY SENSE BUT MY HEART WAS WAS DONE ON THE CROSS FOR ME. I TOOK A WHILE TO WRITE THAT PASTOR BACK AND WE WERE IN JACKSONVILLE A FEW MONTHS LATER. I WASN'T ABLE TO WRITE THAT LETTER WITHOUT TEARS. BUT I SAID TO HIM AT THE END, NOW I KNOW WHO ELSE TO THANK FOR THAT NIGHT SO MANY YEARS AGO. BUT THE LESSON OF HIS LETTER WAS THIS AND REASON I SHARE IT. HE SAID TO ME, MIKE, WHEN I HEARD OF THE DECISION YOU MADE THAT NIGHT, I REALIZED THAT EVEN WHEN THINGS DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY ARE GOING THE WAY THINGS EXPECTED THEY ARE GOING THE WAY HE EXPECTED. I TRULY BELIEVE ON THE EVE OF THIS GEORGIA ELECTION AND EVERY DAY FORWARD, THAT IF WE WILL HOLD FAST TO HIM, WE WILL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH THESE CHALLENGING TIMES AND RESTORE OUR NATION AND RESTORE OUR NATION AND RENEW OUR FREEDOM AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO INSPIRE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS LAND WITH OUR WITNESS WITH THE LOVE AND COMPASSION AND STRENGTH THAT COMES IN A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS CHRIST. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLETS BUT WHAT HOLDS THE FUTURE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES, WINSTON CHURCHILL, IN AN ADDRESS TO CONGRESS IN 1941 AND HE SAID, QUOTE, WE MUST INDEED HAVE A BLIND SOUL WHO CANNOT SEE THE GREAT PURPOSE AND DESIGN THAT IS BEING WORKED OUT BELOW WHICH WE HAVE THE HONOR TO BE FAITHFUL SERVANTS. SO LET'S BE FAITHFUL SERVANTS AND DO OUR PART, DO OUR PART TO DO WHAT IS ALL GREAT OF THIS LAST BEST HOPE OF MANKIND. I LEAVE US TO DO ALL WHAT WE NEED TO DO ALL ACROSS THIS STATE AND ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WHEN GEORGIA STEPS UP AND HOLDS THE LINE AND DEFENDS THE MAJORITY. AND YOUR CONVICTIONS TOMORROW. WHEN YOU SEND PERDUE AND LOEFFLER TO A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT AND KEEP AMERICA GREAT THAN EVER BEFORE. THANK YOU VCH GEORGIA. GOD PLEAS YOU AND DEMROD PLEAS AMERICA. NOW LET'S GET IT DONE!",

         "Well, thank you all very much for that very warm welcome. And on behalf of the President of the United States and the First Family: Welcome to the White House. (Applause.) And join me in thanking an extraordinary leader. I just , as soon as I heard her voice, I had to jump out from behind the curtain. (Laughter.) She is not only the 18th Secretary of Transportation, but frankly, she is one of the most distinguished public servants in the United States of America, with an inspiring personal story. And she makes the American people and this administration proud every day. Join me in thanking Secretary Elaine Chao, will you? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you so much, Elaine. I'm also joined today , I know they've already been introduced, but I just , I have to call them out. We're talking a lot about the economy and a lot about all the great things happening. And you all are such a big part of that in so many ways, so many places around the country. But President Trump and I are so grateful for the tremendous leadership of Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. Wilbur, thank you so much and thank you for being here. (Applause.) And he's a new kid on the block , or the new kid on the Cabinet , but he's already hit the ground running, and he's making an incredible difference to make sure that the American people are prepared for this growing economy, we're able to have safe and productive workplaces, and to do it all in an atmosphere of freedom. Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia, thank you so much for being here. (Applause.) And I want to thank Chairman Mike Duncan, of the Postal Service, for the big announcement today; the Postal Service Board of Governors; and, of course, this initiative's executive director. Give Tina Smith a round of applause, as well as Michael. (Applause.) Thank you. Great job. It is a real privilege be here with all of you to just share for a few minutes during the Lunar New Year celebration, and to take this opportunity to swear in 13 extraordinary Americans as Commissioners of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. I was looking through the list of men and women that will take the oath today, and they represent some of the most accomplished Asian Americans in this country, and they will continue to guide the development of policies that will expand opportunities. And so we'll have them all up here in a minute, but give them a big round of applause right now, will you, please? Congratulations and thank you. (Applause.) And while we gather here and we celebrate the immense contributions of Asian Americans, I know the hearts of many who are gathered here and those that you represent across the United States are with , are with our , are with the Chinese families that are being impacted. Twenty-six different provinces enduring now the impact of the coronavirus. And at present, there have been over 60 deaths. At this hour, more than 3,000 have contracted the disease globally, including five confirmed cases in the United States of America. President Trump made it clear today that we are in close communication with China. And he has offered to President Xi the assistance of the United States of America. And we stand ready to help the people of China confront the coronavirus. (Applause.) And to my fellow Americans, I want to assure you that our administration has taken strong action to deal with this virus. The CDC is following an aggressive plan that will enable us to identify potential cases. So I mentioned there's five confirmed cases in the United States so far. We've , we're already conducting screening at 20 American airports, and they're the airports that receive 90 percent of all passengers from China. Any passengers who are ill will receive additional screening. The State Department has issued a level 4 travel advisory for Wuhan, which makes it clear that no American should travel to Wuhan while this virus continues to have impact. And so let me say once again, here in our country we're taking strong steps to see to the health and the wellbeing of the American people. But as President Trump made clear today, the United States of America stands ready , stands ready to assist the people of China and around the world as they deal with this virus. And you might make a note for anyone in your sphere of influence who would have questions: You can go to CDC.gov/Coronavirus for the latest information on the action of the United States. But the people of China are in the prayers of the American people. And we will stand with them, and we will take the actions necessary to protect the American people. (Applause.) So thank you for allowing me to address that. We gather here this afternoon and with , frankly, with people about the world in the midst of the Lunar New Year celebration. And it includes millions of Americans who will celebrate the Lunar New York, and that's a great privilege for me to be able to join you in this particular moment. And this year we've got a lot to celebrate. For one thing, how about the 2020 Lunar New York stamp? (Applause.) I thanked him already, but Mike Duncan and Luke Grossmann of the Postal Service, thank you. I guess this is a tradition of issuing a Lunar New Year stamp. It's a small tribute to the indispensable contributions that Asian Americans have played throughout the history of this country. And this year's stamp is one more emblematic example of us celebrating that tradition. And this year, I'm proud to report, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, as the Secretaries have no doubt already reflected, Asian Americans are prospering like never before, and the American economy is booming. (Applause.) In fact, Americans of Asian and Pacific Island descent are the fastest-growing group in America , growing by nearly three-quarters in just 15 years, and expected to double over the next 40 years. And, in fact, according to the Census Bureau, household income for Asian Americans is now 40 percent higher than the national average, and rising fast. (Applause.) The American economy is soaring, and Asian Americans are driving capital investment and growth and job creation in cities and towns, large and small, all across the land. Over the summer, I'm told that Asian American unemployment hit the lowest level ever recorded, and it's been under 3 percent for the better part of a year. It's an incredible record of success of the American Dream. And with the help of the commissioners that we will swear in today, I know the best is yet to come for Asian Americans and those of Pacific Island descent. You know, it's a remarkable group. I could literally go through the bios of all of the people that we'll swear in today, but they , you really come from literally every walk of life: small businesses owners , owners like Jan-le Low of Nevada; entrepreneurs like Grace Lee of Michigan; and public servants like Governor Eddie Calvo of Guam and Michelle Steel of California, just to name a few. You all represent extraordinary accomplishment in your own lives and your willingness to come together to participate in this important effort. And it's only going to make it more possible for more Asian Americans and those with Pacific Island backgrounds to be able to prosper and enjoy the American Dream. And so, with that, I want to say thank you and congratulations. Congratulations to all of those that , who will become commissioners today. And I want to thank you for serving your country. I want to thank you for giving back. Each one of you, in your own stories, has lived the American Dream, and you're living it now. And by your participation in the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, you demonstrate that you want to see more; you want to see more Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders live that very same dream for their betterment and the betterment of the United States of America. And so I thank you for your service. And God bless you. (Applause.) With that , with that, I'll ask all of the commissioners to join me on stage, and the secretaries will also stand. And they've got lots of tape up here, in case you don't know where you're supposed to stand. (Laughter.) (The oath is administered.) (Applause.)",

         "SO THIS IS MY FIRST OFFICIAL TRIP TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND DURING OUR TIME HERE YESTERDAY I STARTED THE DAY HAVING MANY INTERVIEWS AND ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS I WAS ASKED AS I'M BRINGING THIS UP AND I WANT TO GET THIS OFF THE TABLE, DO YOU PLAN ON SPENDING ANY TIME HERE, ARE YOU GOING TO COMPETE HERE? I WANT TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW I PLAN ON COMPETING HARD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. AND I PLAN ON DOING WELL HERE. AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WHEN WE RUN THIS ELECTION AND WHEN WE RUN OUR CAMPAIGN SPECIFICALLY THAT WE NOT ONLY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF THE INTENTION TO WIN BUT FRANKLY THE WAY THAT I WILL MEASURE OUR SUCCESS IS NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THAT OF THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE RELEVANT. THE ONLY WAY I THINK TO ENSURE THAT WE WILL BE RELEVANT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SPENDING TIME WITH LEADERS AND THE FOLKS WHO ARE INFORMED, WHO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, WHO CARE ABOUT OUR COUNTRY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I PERSONALLY SPEND TIME IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE I'M BEING CHALLENGED AND WHERE I'M LISTENING AS MUCH IF NOT MORE THAN I TALKED. SO I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, I'M SPENDING A LOT OF TIME IN BEAUTIFUL STATE AND I APPRECIATE AND THANK YOU FOR THE WARM WELCOME THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME SO FAR. SO I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS THAT I HAVE ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET INTO A GROUP CONVERSATION AND BEGIN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER PART OF THIS MORNING. BUT AS JIM SHARED WITH YOU, I AM A CAREER PROSECUTOR BY MOST OF MY CAREER. I WAS BORN IN OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. A DAUGHTER OF TWO PARTICIPANTS , PARENTS WHO ARE GRADUATE STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY AND THEY MET WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THERE. SO MY SISTER MIA AND I, MY SISTER IS HERE, WE GREW THAT UP WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WHO SPENT FULL-TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING ABOUT THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE. AND AMONG THE HEROES, OF COURSE, THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WERE THE LAWYERS. THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO UNDERSTOOD THE SCHOOL OF THE PROFESSION AS LAW. TO TRANSLATE THE PASSION FROM THE STREETS TO THE COURTROOMS OF OUR COUNTRY. AND TO DO THE WORK THAT WE MUST BE DONE OF REMINDING OF GREAT PROMISE WE ARTICULATED IN 1776. WE ARE ALL AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS EQUAL. AT A YOUNG AGE I DECIDED I WANTED TO BE A LAWYER AND I WENT TO HOWARD AS JIM SHARED WITH YOU, AND RIGHT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL I JOINED THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHICH HAS REPUTATION OF BEING ONE OF THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY IN LARGE PART BECAUSE YEARS BEFORE EARL WARREN RAN THAT OFFICE. WHEN I DECIDED TO BECOME A PROSECUTOR THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE THAT QUESTIONED THAT DECISION. MY SISTER WENT TO RUN ACLU. BUT WHAT I SAID THEN AND WHAT I MAINTAIN TODAY AFTER A CAREER AS PROSECUTOR , I WAS A COURTROOM TRIAL LAWYER, I PROSECUTED EVERYTHING INCLUDING HOMICIDE CASES. I WAS THE ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF A MAJOR CITY. I WENT ON TO BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MY STATE. WHAT I MAINTAIN TODAY AFTER A CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER PROSECUTOR IS THIS, THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS A PROFOUND AND DIRECT IMPACT ON THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US AND HAS A RESPONSIBILITY IN THE PROCESS OF GIVING PEOPLE SAFETY, TO GIVE THEM DIGNITY. I ALSO BELIEVE HAVING KNOWN THE SYSTEM FROM THE INSIDE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF ROOM FOR REFORM OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THAT AS WELL. AND SO OF THE MANY PRIORITIES THAT I HAVE IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND IF THE VOTERS WILL HAVE ME AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, ONE OF THEM WILL BE WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BE SMARTER AROUND WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, SO I'M HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT AND WILL ENJOY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THAT. I ALSO BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT RIGHT NOW IN OUR COUNTRY THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY DISTRUSTFUL OF OUR GOVERNMENT AND ITS INSTITUTIONS AND ITS LEADERS, AND WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL AS WE GO FORWARD . THE NATURE OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUST IS SUCH THAT IT IS RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP. YOU GIVE AND YOU RECEIVE TRUST. AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS IN TRUST IS TRUTH. BUT THERE'S A FUNNY THING ABOUT TRUTH. AND AS ROOM OF LEADERS WE KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE. FUNNY THING ABOUT TRUTH IS SPEAKING TRUTH CAN OFTEN MAKE PEOPLE QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE. WHEN YOU STAND BEHIND MICROPHONES LIKE THIS AND YOU'RE AT A PODIUM LIKE THIS THERE'S INCENTIVE THAT WHEN WE SEEK THE , WE SPEAK THE CROWD AND EVERYONE WILL FEEL LOVELY AND SPRINKLE LOVELY DUST IN THE ROOM AND THE JOB WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE. SPEAKING TRUTH DOES NOT ALWAYS ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. BUT THE OTHER THING ABOUT SPEAKING TRUTH IS THIS. YES, PEOPLE WILL WALK AWAY FROM THAT CONVERSATION SAYING I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE WHAT I HAD TO HEAR BUT THEY'LL ALSO WALK AWAY FROM THAT CONVERSATION KNOWING IT WAS AN HONEST CONVERSATION . AND AS WE PROCEED IN THIS CAMPAIGN YEAR I BELIEVE IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT AS LEADERS WE SPEAK TRUTH WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT OFFENDING OUR , OR MAKING PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT WITH THE PURPOSE OF DEALING WITH ISSUES AND INSPIRING TRUST AMONG THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. SO IN THAT CONTEXT I WILL MENTION A FEW ISSUES THAT I THINK NEED TO BE SPOKEN AND A WAY THAT'S ABOUT THE TRUTH. LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR ECONOMY. THE ECONOMY IN AMERICA TODAY IS NOT WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY I SAY , THAT. I SAY THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THE DATA, THE FACTS THAT TELL US THAT ALMOST HALF OF AMERICAN FAMILIES TODAY CANNOT AFFORD A $400 EMERGENCY OR UNINFECTED EXPENSE. , UNEXPECTED EXPENSE. THAT $400 UNEXPECTED EXPENSE THAT THE CAR BREAKS DOWN, MEDICAL BILL THEY DIDN'T ANTICIPATE WILL CAUSE THEM TO LOSE THEIR FOOTING OR GOING TO FINANCIAL SPIRAL. THAT'S A FACT IN AMERICA TODAY. A FACT IN AMERICA TODAY IS THAT IN 99% OF THE COUNTIES IN THE UNITED STATES, IF YOU HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER WORKING FULL-TIME, YOU CANNOT AFFORD MARKET RATE FOR ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. THAT IS A FACT IN AMERICA TODAY. SO THIS DISCUSSION FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS NOT ABOUT SAYING, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED HARD AND GAINED SUCCESS TO BE VILIFIED. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. I APPLAUD THAT. THAT'S PURSUIT OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE AND IF WE HAVE HONEST CONVERSATION WE MUST ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THE RULES AREN'T APPLYING EQUALLY TO ALL PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. THAT NOT ALL PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY HAD EQUAL ACCESS TO A PATH TOWARDS SUCCESS AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CORRECT THAT. FOR EXAMPLE, I PROPOSE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FAMILIES THAT ARE MAKING LESS THAN $100,000, THE FAMILY IS MAKING LESS THAN A $100,000 A YEAR, I'M PROPOSING THAT WE CHANGE OUR TAX CODE TO GIVE THOSE FAMILIES UP TO A $6,000 TAX CREDIT THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE A $500 A MONTH. SO THEY CAN MEET THE COST OF LIVING BECAUSE THERE ARE THOSE WHO WILL SAY THAT ON THE SUBJECT OF THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY TODAY THAT IT'S GREAT, IT'S GREAT. WELL, NOT SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK, HOW ARE YOU MEASURING THE GREATNESS OF THE ECONOMY? AND PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. WELL, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING OUR COUNTRY. YEAH, PEOPLE ARE WORKING. THEY ARE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS. LET'S LOOK AT THE FACT ABOUT WAGES. WAGES FOR THE MOST PART REMAIN STAGNANT WHILE THE COST OF LIVING, TUITION, GAS, HOUSING KEEPS GOING UP. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THESE TRUTHS AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT RECOGNIZES THAT THERE'S SOME COURSE CORRECTION THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. SO ON THE SUBJECT OF RENTERS, FOR EXAMPLE, I KNOW THIS IS A BIG ISSUE HERE. THE OTHER PROPOSAL THAT I OFFER IS THAT IF A RENTER IS PAYING MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME IN RENT PLUS UTILITIES, THAT THEY GET A TAX CREDIT TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE COST OF THEIR RENT. SO THAT'S A SUBJECT OF THE ECONOMY AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LONGER AND MORE IN-DEPTH CONVERSATION THERE. ON THE ISSUE OF EDUCATION, LET'S SPEAK THE TRUTH. WE ARE A SOCIETY THAT PRETENDS TO CARE ABOUT EDUCATION BUT NOT SO MUCH THE EDUCATION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN. LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THAT. LET'S LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE WE HAVE A PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR MOST OF OUR CHILDREN. AND WE WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT. WE WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT IN A WAY THAT RECOGNIZES AND, AGAIN, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THE COUNTRY. I'VE MET TEACHERS WHO ARE WORKING TWO JOBS, SOMETIMES THREE TO NOT ONLY PAY THE BILL BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE COMING OUT OF POCKET ON A CONSISTENT BASIS TO PAY FOR THE TOOLS FOR THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR CLASSROOM TO ACTUALLY BE EDUCATED BECAUSE WE ARE NOT PUTTING THE RESOURCES INTO OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AS WE SHOULD. I WILL TELL YOU MY PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THIS IS VAST. MY FIRST-GRADE TEACHER, MRS. FRANCES, GOD REST HER SOUL ATTENDED MY LAW SCHOOL , GRADUATION. IT WAS A TIME IN AMERICA WHERE WE WERE PAYING PUBLIC TEACHERS THEIR VALUE. UNDERSTANDING THAT IN ADDITION TO PARENTS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE , RAISING OUR CHILDREN ARE OUR TEACHERS AND WE MUST GIVE THEM THE VALUE OF WHAT THEY ARE GIVING US IN RETURN. LET'S SPEAK MORE TRUTH. CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S REAL. IT'S REAL. AND IT IS POSING EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO US AS HUMAN BEINGS AND WE MUST NOT ONLY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, WE MUST HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT THIS. I WAS IN PORTSMOUTH YESTERDAY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE RATE IN TERMS OF DECLINE BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DECLINE, WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IT WILL BE UNDER WATER. THIS IS A REAL ISSUE. WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED AT THE UNITED STATES SENATE I WAS , WELL, I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW I'M ON SEVERAL COMMITTEES. I'M ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. I'M HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE AND I'M ON JUDICIARY AND I'M ON BUDGET. IN ADDITION, WHEN I FIRST GOT THERE I WAS IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC WORKS. SO I SAT IN HEARINGS WHERE I KID YOU NOT, ONE OF THE HEARINGS WE HAD, THE PREMISE OF THE HEARING WAS ESSENTIALLY TO SCIENCE THE BASIS OF PUBLIC POLICY. FURTHER BACKGROUND ABOUT ME. MY SISTER AND I WERE RAISED BY A MOTHER WHO HAD TWO GOALS IN HER LIFE. MY MOTHER WAS A BREAST CANCER RESEARCHER AND SHE HAD TWO GOALS IN HER LIFE. TO RAISE HER TWO DAUGHTERS AND END BREAST CANCER. WE SHOULD TAKE US TO THE LAB WITH HER. WE WOULD GO AFTER SCHOOL ON WEEKENDS. I GREW UP AROUND THE PEOPLE WHO THEIR WHOLE PURPOSE FOR BEING WAS TO USE RESEARCH AND FACTS AND SCIENCE IN A WAY THAT COULD IMPROVE HUMAN CONDITION. AND WE RIGHT NOW ARE IN A SITUATION, HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION WHO HAS AMERICAN PUBLIC BUY SCIENCE FICTION INSTEAD OF SCIENCE FACT, TO OUR COLLECTIVE PERIL. TO OUR COLLECTIVE PERIL. AND YOU KNOW, I JOKE ABOUT IT ON THIS ISSUE. LOOK, I CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE NOT BECAUSE I HAVE ANY PARTICULAR DESIRE TO HUG A TREE , BUT I HAVE A VERY STRONG DESIRE TO HUG A HEALTHY BABY. AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT THIS IS A MATTER THAT INCLUDES WHETHER OR NOT WE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRINK CLEAN WATER AND BREATHE CLEAN AIR. LET'S TALK TRUTH AND FACTS. LET'S LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT, AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY LEADERS IN BUSINESS HERE, WHETHER WE ARE PREPARED FOR THE NEEDS OF THE WORKFORCE OF THE 21ST CENTURY. LET'S TALK TRUTH. OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS IT IS PRETTY WIDELY ACCEPTED AND AGREED UPON THAT OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS UP TO 40% OF THE JOBS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST WILL NO LONGER EXIST. WE HAVE TO SPEAK THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS. WE HAVE TO SPEAK TRUTH THAT AUTOMATION IS REAL. WE HAVE TO SPEAK TRUTH THAT WE ARE IN THE MIX OF AN INDUSTRIAL , MIXED OF AN INDUSTRIAL , MIDSST OF AN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. WE HAVE TO SPEAK TRUTH THAT WE ARE NOT EQUIPPING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE , AGREE WITH PART OF WHO WE ARE CULTURALLY WHICH IS HARD-WORKING , HARD WORK IS GOOD WORK. BUT YET WE AS LEADERS ARE NOT PREPARING THE WORKFORCE OF AMERICA FOR THE JOBS OF THE 21ST CENTURY. THERE'S A LIST THAT CAME OUT FROM THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS MID-LAST YEAR THAT PROJECTS THE 20 JOBS BETWEEN 2016 AND 2026 THAT WILL SEE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF GROWTH. I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS LIST. SHE IS ABOUT TO START TALKING ABOUT THAT LIST. YES, I AM. SO I'M GOING TO NOW GET INTO AN INTERACTIVE MOMENT IF YOU GIVE THE DACHSHUND TILDE ME FOR A MOMENT. THE 20 JOBS THAT WILL SEE THE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF GROWTH OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. I WILL TAKE TWO GUESSES, JIM, OK. GUESS WHAT'S NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO ARE. YES? SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. THERE ARE A LOT THAT RELATE TECHNOLOGY BUT THAT'S NOT THAT, THAT'S NOT NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO. YES, IN THE BACK. I KID YOU NOT. YOU ARE THE FIRST PERSON. YES, TECHNOLOGY JOBS OR THEY'LL GUESS RIGHTLY BECAUSE MOST JOBS RELATE TO PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE ALSO HAVE AN AGING POPULATION. NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO, INSTALLATION OF MAINTENANCE OF SOLAR PANELS AND WIND TURBINES. SO, RIGHT, RENEWABLE ENERGY. THIS IS PART OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO. THE REASON THOSE JOBS ARE ON OUR LIST IS BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP WHERE A JOB THAT NEEDS TO BE PERFORMED FOR WHICH WE DON'T HAVE THE SKILL ED LABOR. HOW ARE WE THINKING ABOUT PUTTING IN PLACE AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR COUNTRY TO PREPARE OUR WORKFORCE IN A WAY THAT HAS GOT TO INCLUDE AS PART OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THAT CONVERSATION THE PRIVATE SECTOR? WHAT JOBS DO YOU NEED PERFORMED? WHAT ARE THE SKILLS REQUIRED TO PERFORM THAT JOB? IT HAS TO INCLUDE OUR EDUCATORS, THERE'S SO MANY IN THIS ROOM. ARE WE AS GOVERNMENT LEADERS CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THAT IS HAPPENING IN AN HONEST WAY? INCLUDING OUR LABOR LEADERS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I WAS TALKING WITH MY FRIENDS IN THE BUILDING TRADES ABOUT THIS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THEY SAID. EVERYBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE NEW SKILLS THAT ARE INVOLVED, THAT'S GOOD-OLD FASHION WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IN OUR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOREVER. PIPE FITTING, ELECTRICIANS, WELDERS. RIGHT QUESTION MARK , RIGHT. SO THE TRUTH, I WILL NOW END MY ISSUE SPOTTING. THERE ARE SEMI TRUTHS THAT WE MUST SPEAK RIGHT NOW. I WILL SAY THIS I REMAIN VERY , OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF AND WHERE WE WILL GO. I BELIEVE AND I KNOW WE ALL DO, THIS IS A ROOM FULL OF LEADERS THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEAS. , IDEALS. WE WERE FOUNDED ON THE IDEALS THAT WERE BEHIND AND INFORMED THE WRITING OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. THE IDEA THAT WERE BEHIND THOSE WORDS IN 1776 THAT WE ALL SHOULD BE TREATED AS EQUAL. PART OF OUR STRENGTH AS A NATION IS WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE FIGHT TO ACHIEVE THOSE IDEALS. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR EYED. WE HAVE NEVER QUITE REACHED THOSE IDEALS BUT OUR STRENGTH IS , THAT WE FIGHT TO REACH THOSE IDEALS. AND THIS IS THE MOMENT IN PARTICULAR WHERE WE MUST KEEP FIGHTING KNOWING THAT THESE ARE NOBLE IDEALS, KNOWING THAT IS PART OF OUR STRENGTH AND PURPOSE AND JUST THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE. SO I THINK OF THIS AS BEING AN EXCITING MOMENT IN TIME AND I'M HONORED THAT YOU ALL HAVE FROM YOUR BUSY LIVES IN YOUR COMMITMENTS CHOSEN TO SPEND THE MORNING WITH ME. I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM YOU.",

         "Well, thank you very much, Stanley. And thank you for your tremendous support of this wonderful parade. Today, we come together as one nation to salute the veterans of the United States Armed Forces , the greatest warriors to ever walk the face of the Earth. Our veterans risked everything for us. Now it is our duty to serve and protect them every single day of our lives. It is truly an honor to come back to New York City, right here in Madison Square Park, to be the first President ever to attend 'America's Parade.' (Applause.) To every veteran here with us, to the thousands preparing to march on 5th Avenue , it'll be really something , and to the 18 million veterans across our country: The First Lady and I have come to express the everlasting love and loyalty of 327 million Americans. I want to recognize Department of Veterans Affairs Deputy Secretary James Byrne for joining us. Thank you, James. Thank you, James. (Applause.) Great job. I'm pleased to report that our administration and all of the work that we've done , the veteran satisfaction with the VA is at 90 percent. It's the highest rate ever recorded in the history of this particular program. And that's awfully good, and we're very proud of you and the Secretary. Thank you very much. Great job. (Applause.) Also with us is New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. (Applause.) Along with many other distinguished guests. Thanks as well to everyone at the United War Veterans Council for putting on this incredible event, including Bill White, Doug McGowan, and a very special acknowledgement to someone who has devoted his life to this parade: Marine Vietnam veteran Vince McGowan. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, each of you, and all of the supporters whose generosity make this parade possible. Tremendous amounts of work has been done, and tremendous, frankly, amounts of money has been donated. And we appreciate it, and we appreciate Stanley. We're very glad to be joined as well by the Honorary Grand Marshal of the Parade, Marine Corps Commandant General David Berger and the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Troy Black. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Let us also show our profound appreciation to the 2019 grand marshals of the parade who have served in World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, and Iraq. This morning, as more than 30,000 patriotic Americans line the streets of Manhattan, we carry on a noble tradition that began one century ago. In 1919, the people of this city filled block after block to welcome home General Pershing and his 25,000 American soldiers after victory in World War One. Just a few years before, many of those soldiers had boarded ships not far from here at Hoboken Port. More than 4 million Americans fought in the Great War, and more than 116,000 made the ultimate sacrifice. At the 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the 11th month, in 1918, the Armistice was declared, the war had come to an end, and the Allies achieved a great, great victory.Every year since, on November 11th, we have shared our nation's deepest praise and gratitude to every citizen who has worn the uniform of the American Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Marines. We are profoundly moved to have with us veterans of World War Two, including one of the grand marshals, Woody Williams. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Woody. Thank you very much, Woody. To each veteran of the war: The glory of your deeds will only grow greater with time. This city is graced by your presence. This nation is forever in your debt. And we thank you all.We're also pleased to be joined by veterans of the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the War on Terror. You are the reason our hearts swell with pride, our foes tremble with fear, and our nation thrives in freedom. Would you please stand so that we can honor your heroic service? Please. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you all.Each year, this parade highlights one branch of our military. This year, we honor the elite masters of air, land, and sea , the legendary Leathernecks, the feared Devil Dogs, the 'first to flight ': the United States Marines. Let's hear it. (Applause.) That's great. Yesterday, we celebrated the Marines' 244th birthday. That's pretty good. (Applause.) The Few and the Proud are always faithful, and they always win. I also want to thank the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation, which provides scholarships to children of our fallen heroes. To every Gold Star Family: We will stand by your side forever.It is very fitting that the Veterans Day Parade begin right here in New York City. Since the earliest days of our nation, New York has exemplified the American spirit and has been at the heart of our nation's story of daring and defiance. On July 2nd, 1776, the British Armada sailed into New York Harbor, numbering more than 400 ships and carrying more than 30,000 men. The British came here to snuff out what they thought was just a minor American Revolution. Didn't turn out to be that way. But the Redcoats did know , what they did know was they were going to have a problem, but they didn't know that New York would meet them with the fearsome power of American patriots. In World War One, New York regiments like 'Harlem Hellfighters,' the 'Lost Battalion,' and 'the Fighting 69th' were revered all over the globe. During World War Two, 63 million tons of supplies and more than 3 million service members shipped out of New York Harbor.On September 11, 2001, the whole world saw the horror and responded to America's wicked enemies with unwaving courage, unbreakable spirit and resolve that is deeper than oceans, fiercer than fires, and stronger than steel. Last week, I was honored to award the Presidential Citizens Medal to an extraordinary American: Rick Rescorla. Rick enlisted in the Army at the recruiting center in Times Square, became a great war hero in Vietnam, and then became head of security at Morgan Stanley in the World Trade Center. On September 11th, he saved 2,700 lives before giving his own. Today, we are immensely grateful to be joined by Rick's son, Trevor. Thank you, Trevor. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you. To Trevor and every 9/11 family, we pledge to never, ever forget.The towering spirit of strength that we see in this city lives within the heart of every American warrior. From the snow of Valley Forge to the jungles of Vietnam, from the forests of Belleau Wood to the beaches of Normandy, from the mountains of Afghanistan to the deserts of Iraq, that spirit has helped our fighters defeat tyrants, conquer fascism, vanquish communism, and face down terrorism. Just a few weeks ago, American Special Forces raided the ISIS compound and brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice. Thanks to American warriors, al-Baghdadi is dead , (applause) , his second in charge is dead, we have our eyes on number three, his reign of terror is over, and our enemies are running very, very scared. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Those who threaten our people don't stand a chance against the righteous might of the American military.In a few weeks, we will mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge , our nation's bloodiest battle of World War Two. More than 47,000 Americans were wounded, and 19,000 gave their last breath for their country. We are proudly joined today by a veteran of the Battle of the Bulge, a native New Yorker who is 94 years old and still going very, very strong: Corporal Jack Foy. (Applause.) You look good, Jack. You look good. Jack enlisted in the Army right out of high school. He fought through brutal months of the campaign in northern France. On Christmas Eve, after marching nearly 100 miles in the snow in sub-zero temperatures, he arrived outside the town of Bastogne in Belgium. For two weeks, Jack fought under ceaseless artillery fire and helped push the enemy back from a critical road. At one point, a mine blew up and it destroyed his vehicle, badly hurting many. He was wounded three times, but he kept on fighting.After the Allied victory at the Battle of the Bulge, Jack fought for the remaining nine months of the war , across the Siegfried line, up the Moselle River, through the Rhineland, and all the way across Germany until he reached the gates of Ohrdruf concentration camp, the first Nazi camp to be liberated. That was number one. That was a big, big event.As Jack has said about the Battle of the Bulge, 'When the chips were down and the situation was desperate, the American soldiers stood up to be counted. For a brief moment in history, these men held our nation's destiny in their hands. We did not fail.' Thank you very much, Jack. (Applause.) Great. And, Corporal Foy, we will forever be proud of what you and your fellow soldiers achieved for all of humanity.Also here with us today is Lauren Mathews, the granddaughter of a Battle of the Bulge veteran who has since passed away. His name was Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds. Like so many of our veterans, Roddie never talked about the war. Lauren never knew her grandfather's story until she embarked upon a school project about 10 years ago. Roddie was in the 422nd regiment, which was overwhelmed when the Nazis launched their surprise assault. He and his men fought for three treacherous days before being taken as prisoners of war.After they arrived at a prison camp, the German commander sent an order over the loud speaker. The Jewish-American soldiers were all told to step out of line during the roll call the next day. Knowing the terrible fate that would come to his Jewish comrades, Roddie immediately said, 'We're not doing that.' He sent orders to have every American step out of line with their Jewish brothers-in-arms. The next morning, 1,292 Americans stepped forward. The German commander stormed over to Roddie and said, 'They cannot all be Jews.' Roddie stared right back; he said, 'We are all Jews here.' At that point, the German put a gun to Roddie's head and demanded, 'You will order the Jews to step forward immediately or I will shoot you right now through the head.' Roddie responded, 'Major, you can shoot me, but you'll have to kill us all.' That's something. (Applause.) The German turned red, got very angry, but put down his gun, and walked away. Master Sergeant Edmonds saved 200 Jewish-Americans , soldiers that day. So proud to be Jewish and so proud of our country. Lauren, thank you for being here today as we remember your grandfather's unbelievable and exceptional valor. Lauren, please stand up. Thank you very much. (Applause.) One of the 200 Jewish-American soldiers who was saved that fateful day is Staff Sergeant Lester Tanner. Lester is now 96 years old , (applause) , and he joins us here. Boy, you guys are looking very good. Ninety-six. Lester , you're really 96, Lester? I don't believe it. You're looking good. Thank you very much. Thank you also for your very noble service and for sharing this incredible story with the world. Thank you very much, Lester. The men and women who have donned our nation's uniforms are the bravest, toughest, strongest, and most virtuous warriors ever to walk on Earth. You left your families and fought in faraway lands. You came face-to-face with evil and you did not back down. You returned home from war, and you never forgot your friends who didn't return, including prisoners of war and those missing in action.Every day, you think of them and pray for them. But your greatest tribute of all is the way you lived your lives in the years since. You raised your families, you endured the wounds of war, and you endured the pains of that memory. Yet, you keep going, you keep serving, you keep giving, and you keep loving. You volunteer at your local veterans post, and you keep in touch with your battle comrades. You support our Gold Star Families, you take care of our wounded warriors, and you stand alongside of our service members when they return from war. On Veterans Day, our nation rededicates itself to our most solemn duty. While we can never repay our warriors for their boundless service and sacrifice, we must uphold with supreme vigilance our sacred obligation to 'care for those who have borne the battle.' In just a minute, we will have a moment of silence and we will lay a wreath at the Eternal Light Monument. As we do, with God as our witness, we pledge to always honor our veterans and pay immortal tribute to those who have laid down their lives so that we might be free. Together, we must safeguard what generations of fearless patriots gave everything to secure. We will protect our liberty, uphold our values, and defend our home. We will ensure that righteous legacy of America's veterans stands as a testament to this nation from now until the end of time.To every veteran here today and all across our land: You are America's greatest living heroes and we will cherish you now, always, and forever. Thank you. God bless our veterans. And God bless America. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much.",

         "Yeah, thank you very much. Hello, Newport News. I know it. Well, I don't I know it Well, you know, my father and I had a couple of little jobs here and they were great. When the ships came in, they were packed where the ships went out. They were stone cold, empty. I said, This is a different kind of a place, but we loved it. And it's a great place. And I'm thrilled to be back in the Commonwealth of Virginia with thousands of loyal, hard working American patriots. And I also want to thank the great people of North Carolina who's here from North Carolina. Not bad. It's a little area there 39 days from now. We're going to win, Virginia, we're going to win North Carolina. We're going to win four more years in the White House and keep doing what we've been doing because it's never been anything quite like it. This is the most important election in the history of our country. One of the biggest issues for the people of Virginia is your Second Amendment. And if sleepy Joe Biden wins, your second Amendment will be eliminated and your firearms will be confiscated whether you like it or not. When asked of a Biden administration was coming after your guns, Biden replied, Yes, totally had to say yes. He promised to put the gun grabber. Baidoa rock in a Beto Beto member, Beto. He was on the cover of a third rate magazine, and he said, I was born to run for president. That was the end of his run. That's what it ended. Any time they say they were born to do it, they got problems that didn't work out. It was a steep drop. But he put Beto in charge of his assault on your guns, and you know what happened with bait? Obaida went crazy. He wants to take your guns away. Biden vows to impose punishing taxes on gun owners, outlaw many of the most popular firearms in America, create a national gun registry and wage the most aggressive war on gun rights in U. S. History. Biden will disarm law abiding Americans at the same time. They'll have riots down your street, and that's just fine. That's OK, That's okay, according to the left wing. Only by voting for me can you save your country and can you save your Second Amendment. So I was told not to go for Virginia. We did really well last time, and I never came. I never did anything and we did really well. I said, Why didn't I go for Virginia? But it's traditionally not a Republican state over the last number of decades, and I said, Why not? You have a crazy governor and every time I see it every two weeks, he's trying to take your guns away right on. He'll attack constantly, right to life, and you know, he's so far left. He doesn't even talk about late term. He talks about after the baby was born, which is the first time I ever heard of that. You hear late term. But he said, and after the baby is born, we'll start talking to mother. In other words, he's talking about execution of the baby execute. You have a governor that thinks he's Michael Jackson. Remember his wife? Saved. Remember, he wanted to prove that he was just dressed up like Michael Jackson, that he sometimes thought when he was young, that he resembled Michael Jackson? I don't think so. And you remember he wanted you moon walk across the stage and his wife said, No, no, don't do it. Don't Don't Please don't nobody Moon walks like Michael. That would have been good. I wish I could have seen that That wouldn't have that would not have been pretty. So based on your governor and based on the fact that he's always you, never every like month. You're fighting for guns. If I'm not here, your Second Amendment is gone, and I'm talking about all over the country. Forget about just Virginia. So I said, Let's give Virginia shot. We're nearby. Were nearby. I even said We'll bring in the heavy artillery will bring in our great vice president, Mike Pence. Oh, did he do a good job? I'll tell you what Kamala Kamala is. No Mike Pence. She's no Mike Pence. Now he's great. He's done a fantastic job and he's with you all the way. So I said, Let's give it a shot and you know there's a big difference. I tell you what. There's never been a bigger difference between candidates or parties. Never been no party that supports as an example. What he would do to a child after it was born is fit to be even involved in any way in this nation, let alone running this nation. As you know, sleepy Joe Biden endorsed your governor, So that means he endorsed the policy of your governor. That means that means he endorsed. He endorsed breaking up your second Amendment. So it'll either be totally broken up, or it will be, you know, wiped out. Essentially, it won't be that much different. So here we are in Virginia. Like like I had nothing to do today. I woke up at six. In the morning. I read some papers, so I read the fakers, add, and then I was in Florida early in the morning, and then I went to Florida and we did a big round table with the Hispanics. They were great. And then we flew to Atlanta from Florida Palm Beach. And then we flew. We started off in all different places. We were all and then we flew. We went to Miami. We started off. But I'll tell you what, Florida's great. We're gonna win. Florida were way up in Florida. Yeah, even a poll that gave me I mean, I've never had a good number. ABC Washington Post Poll It's a terrible polo has been bad. I think it got everything wrong. Four years ago, they said I'm four up Orm or but im four up in the state of Florida. So anyway, so we went to Miami. Want to a beautiful place, actually a mammy. You know where that is, right? And we had we had I won't say because then they'll say, I'm advertising. If I do that, e, I won't say I won't say the name of the place, but it is beautiful. And then what happened is we went thio Atlanta and we So we left the great Hispanics. We call him the Latinos for Trump Latinos, where we are polling at numbers that I guess no Republican has ever pulled before. Perhaps Abraham Lincoln. But in those days, he wasn't big into the Hispanic movement. I think Abraham had other things to think about don't we think? But I will say this. Nobody has Dunmore for many communities, but I always say, for the black community, nobody has Dunmore for the black community. Thank Donald Trump since Abraham like it. Nobody. So we flew to Atlanta and we had on unbelievable two hours. And this was with the African American community. That black community, I always say, What do you like? Better tell me what you like better. They say, usually the black community on what is the answer? Tell me, African American, I'm not listening. I don't want to hear from other people. What do you African American? What do you like better African American or black community? It's black. Yeah, that's why we're here. I'll go with whatever you want. That's your choice. We could use either one. I'll go with whatever you want. We had really a great way. Had a great two hours. Credible people. Herschel Walker introduced me. Serious, Serious. We had a lot of champion fighters, a lot of great people. It was an amazing time. And then we flew to Washington, where we had a roundtable and then I say, Well, that's it for the night, right you know, this starts at six. In the morning. So I said, That's it for the night. Is that it? I'll go back home to the White House. No, sir. Well, I wonder what you're going to. Virginia, sir. Oh. Oh, that's good. Thank you very much. This was like I asked the question about an hour ago. Where am I going now? Put me in, Coach. You ever hear the expression just wind me up and put me in? Coach? I said, Where we going tonight? Yeah, I said, let's go back to the White House. Let's see your first lady. And they said no, sir, you have a rally schedule. You have a rally schedule. Where is it? In Virginia said. Oh, that's good. How many people? They said a hell of a lot of people. Well, I wouldn't. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. When you have rallies like this, you don't forget him. You don't forget him. Thank you. Go ahead. That s so we're gonna put a heavy play in for Virginia. Seriously, we're gonna put a heavy play in Virginia. I think we can win this state. Man, that crowd is big. Look at that goes way back to the hangar. That is a big problem. That's big. You know, I always tell the cameras I don't want to bore people with this, but I implore them, Turn the cameras around and show them the size of the crowd goes back to the building. But they never like doing it because they don't like, including Fox. They don't like showing big crowds. They don't like showing big. We left Ohio were way up in Ohio. Way up. We're way up in Georgia. We were in Georgia today, though, with the governor and the senator. Senator Purdue Way. We're you're in. No, representative Doug Collins. Great guy Kelly. Lawful er, great person, Senator and Senator Purdue. And I said, How are we doing? They said, You're winning by a lot in Georgia. Do anybody? Of course, if you see these people, they'll say he's pretty close in Georgia. Too close to call, and then we have election night comes the polls in Georgia, closed. Donald Trump has won the state of Georgia and I only one of Europe by like, if Europe by a lot, they announcer to me that that was what happened with Texas last time. They said Texas is too close to call, all for months and months and months, the only one that didn't believe that with the people in Texas. So when it closed, they said, the polls in Texas are closed. Donald Trump has one that said, like in the same breath. Now we're doing great in Texas. We're doing great all over the place. We're doing great all over. I think I hear where I hear we're up in New Hampshire, which is great. Last time that one got taken away from us with people that just came in with Busses all over the place. That bus is coming up from Massachusetts. You have the rhino, governor. You know the rhino Governor of Massachusetts, right? Baker? He's a rhino, But I guess he does whatever he can to get elected. The Democrat Party is now run by Socialists and Marxists who want to destroy our laws, our values, and want to destroy your way of life. To uphold. Our Constitution has written. Tomorrow I will be announcing my nominee to the United States Supreme Court. Fill that seat. We're gonna fill it. Don't worry. And the Republicans have been very unified. You see that? Very unified. Even a couple of people that normally don't vote for with us. You know, they usually don't vote with the Republicans, but they are on. We have tremendous unity. Then the party Mitch is doing a good job. Kevin is doing a good job. We're gonna take over the house. We're gonna take back the house. People are tired of crazy, Nancy. They're tired. We want to get some stimulus out. She doesn't want to give it. She just doesn't only big for political reasons. Not your fault. You know whose fault it is? China's fault. That's the fault. That's who's fault. But, you know, it's an amazing thing because the Democrats are saying, Well, it's the end of a term and because, you know, we have a lot of time left. Think of this. If it were them, don't forget we don't have to do it by the election, but we should be easy, really able. That would be a great victory going into the election with the biggest of all victories. You know, they say the biggest thing you could do is the appointment of judges, but especially the appointment of Supreme Court justices. That's the single biggest ah, president. Because it sets the tone of the country for 40 years. 50 years. I've been a long time. So we're gonna be announcing somebody. Great. I just think that, you know, there. I just watched the great thing about Air Force One. There are more televisions on that plane than any plane. They got him in every room and you open up for a closet. You want a shirt, Let me about is a television. And I'm watching the Democrats saying how terrible it is that we're pointing. We have the right. We won the election, right that we have the right way. We have a lot of time. And if they were in opposition, they would do the same thing. Maybe they would just do it more rapidly. Okay, more rapidly now. So tomorrow I think it's gonna be a big day. Five oclock tomorrow at the White House. We're gonna be naming the nominee. Hopefully will be on that court for 50 years. 500 beyond there for 50 years. The only thing I can tell you for sure is it will be a woman because I don't Does anybody have any objections to that? Police, Please raise your hand. A lot of cowards out there look atyou. Men. I don't see how is not one man here that has the guts to raise your hand? Not one if given the power of the radical left, will pack the Supreme Court with extremists who will strike the words under God from the Pledge of Allegiance. As they did twice I heard their pledge of allegiance. They had it in their caucus. I'm watching. I said, Oh, they made a mistake. I said to the first lady, darling, they made a mistake. They left the words under God out. And then I heard it a second time, and they made the same mistake. I said, This is straight. This is like the guys on the Mueller team that's lean their phones, right? 31 phones. And they said, Oh, we made a mistake and they all made the exact same mistake. The odds of that are a billion to one, right? They all made all they got caught. Did you see what's going on? Oh, they got caught. Say, I feel sorry. That's Ah, that's a shame. Yeah, they should be. They are, they should. They're crooked people. They're crooked people. So they cleaned up their phones. Hillary took our phones and smashed him. She took 33,000 emails and deleted them after Congress requested them. And I think they're looking at that, too. I think so. I've Can you imagine? I have a friend? He's very smart, Rich guy made a lot of money, but he's a very street wise guy. He said, You know, you've been under investigation by these thieves and they're smart. They just weren't smart when they all use the same exact method to clean their phone. That wasn't smart. You know, At least put it a little bit there. 31 different phones like What is it? 21 people, 31 phone. But that's okay. That's okay. That's on Lee. It's only illegal, but this friend of mine said, you know, they've gone through everything. They've gone through your taxes. They've gone through your financials. They've gone through everything. You have to be the most honest guy in the world, and they come up. No collusion. Oh, they wanted if they found if they found anything now it's a bad group of people headed by Robert Mueller. Bad. Who wanted the job but the FBI. But he lied to Congress. He said he didn't say that, but he did. I mean, he did. We have all the proof. So he is in the same group, you know? But they're actually in worse shape. Because at least with Mueller, you could say he probably didn't know what the hell he was doing. Sort of like Joe Biden. I figure about about the same. Does that make sense? Is anybody under? How would you like to? You're getting a divorce or something. And you say I gotta be represented by Bob Mueller. Do you think so? You saw his performance in Congress, right? I wanna be represented by Bob Mueller. No, it's the same thing. How can we have Joe Biden representing this country? And you know, he's on the lid. You know, the lid. The lid is when they say we're gonna put a lid on it. So I guess it means probably what it's supposed. I have no idea, Lid. It's settled in, but it's an expression. And every day, early in the morning they say, Joe, Joe, I mean, Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. He's put a lid on it, sir. Biden has put a lid on it. What does that mean? That means he's not working today. This guy takes more days off. You have tow, have a president that's gonna work his off of this country. You need energy job. You need a very energetic president. They said, How do you think he's going to do in the debate? I think good. He's been doing it for 47 years. I think he's gonna do good. I think on one thing, we know if he does just okay, just okay? They're gonna say the fake news. They're gonna say it was the single greatest debate performance in history. It was unbelievable. Far better than Winston Churchill in his pride. Winston Churchill was nothing compared to Sleepy Joe. So you know that if he finishes the if he finishes, which I think he will, and he might even do well. But if he does what they're going to say, it's the greatest of paper and they haven't already written. They have a couple of scenarios. If he does really poorly, they're going to say he wasn't bad. He wasn't bad if he does modestly well, like he did against Bernie, they were sort of. Even if he does like that, they'll say it was the greatest performance in history. But with your vote, I will preserve our Constitution and ensure law and order. Joe Biden is weak. He surrendered his party to the flag burners, the rioters, the anti police anarchists, the radicals. All these guys running around these thes Democrats run cities and states. Look at it. 10 out of 10. We could fix up Portland so fast they have to invite us. And I wanna be invited into that. One way would fix that like we did. Minneapolis Way would fix that up in in less than a half a Now, er, remember Minneapolis? They were right. I mean, the problem is they invited us in about two weeks. By the time they invited, it was a lot of flames behind him. Remember, the reporter is standing there. Thistle is a peaceful protest on behind him. You have like blocks. It looked like Berlin during the war, didn't it? I never saw anything. This is the craziest thing. It's a peaceful performance. But what we did, we said. It's a peaceful protest and we don't call these rallies anymore because in Dem states, like where you have a governor who's a Democrat, you're not allowed to go to church. You're not allowed to go to a restaurant. You're not allowed to go to your friend's house. You can't move from your house unless you're related to the governor. Then you could do whatever the hell you want. You can't do anything. You can't do anything. Unless, of course, it's a peaceful protest. Okay, add. So what we do is we call these peaceful protests that were getting big crowds. 25. 30,000. 35,000. There's Mawr enthusiasm now. Then there was four years ago because we've done a good job, right? There's more now. Now we have more enthusiasm. Now that we did, you know it's interesting. Don't forget. Four years ago, I did a nice job. I was successful, had a great television show, The Apprentice. It was great. People got to know me a little bit. I said, Let me run. From the time the first hour that we came down the escalator first lady and I down the escalator her with a white dress, right? Very famous escalator. Right now, people go take pictures of the escalator. But we came down the escalator. We were in first place, right? We never went. I never left center stage. Right? And that's based on poll numbers. If you're the number one polar. And I said, Look, I want an odd number. I don't want an even number, because what what are you talking? I said because that means two people are in center, and that's not fair. So I want an odd number. We were on center stage, but we've done a good Jeff. What happened is I came. I said I was gonna cut your taxes Way gave you the biggest tax decrease in history. I said I was going to cut regulations, and we're gonna have an incredible economy. And regulations were probably even more important than the tax cuts. Okay, You wanna know the truth? You asked the business people the great ones. They will tell you if they had a choice, they'll take the regulation cuts and we still have a ways to go with that. But we did that. We rebuilt your military, we add a space force. I mean, what we've done is far more far more right to try. How about right to try? I never talked about that. I never talked about. We knocked out 100% of the Isis caliphate, right? We achieve energy independence on. We've done it while protecting our very pristine environment, By the way, on earlier this month. Oh, you're gonna be so happy. Virginia and North Carolina. Come on, North Carolina, you're gonna be so happy you're gonna be cheering like crazy because I think you like this. But about a month ago, I signed an order prohibiting offshore drilling on the Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coasts. Right, right. And because I happen to like the state a lot, I said, What about Virginia? What about North Carolina? And somebody said, I don't know. I don't know if they like it. I said, I think they like it. So I'm extending the moratorium to North Carolina and Virginia of Yeah, And if you wanna have oil rigs out there, just let me know we'll take it off. I mean, you know, I can understand that too. I can understand that, too, but I think you want it so we're extending it to Virginia. We're extending it to North Carolina up the coast, and we're not gonna have any problems like can be had. All right, so I think you like that. You don't like it. You're gonna let me know. I'm gonna change it. I can change things very easily. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we're quickly doing it again. So I did all of these things. And in doing all these things you said the second time. Well, now this is actually a much easier campaign. In a way. The only problem is I've been tarred with this horrible witch hunt for four years, and I didn't do it. Now think of it. What would my numbers be if I didn't go through almost four years of a Russian witch hunt that turned out to be just the opposite? They were the ones that were involved with Russia. It was the whole big disinformation campaign. Now what were by numbers be with all that we've done on. If you didn't here night after night on fake news, CNN and M S. D. N. C. On The New York Times and The Washington Post. And now it's turning out, not turning out. It's done because if you look at everything that's come out over the last few days, it's We caught him. They've been caught. They spied on my campaign and they tried for a coup. Can you believe it in this day and age? And we caught him called. So what would our numbers be? Our numbers, Some money. What would our numbers bay if every night, every morning, every day they were saying Russia, Russia, Russia. It turned out to be a total hoax. In fact, biting son, it was just revealed two days ago. Got $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Think of it so. But I really think about that. What would be on it? We did all these incredible things with the economy. With everything that we got hit with this virus from China, they should never have let it happen. We won't forget it. And we closed up. We saved millions of lives. Now we've opened. It was opening to records. But what would our popularity be if every day for almost four years you didn't hear any of this bullshit. Okay, what would it be true? What would they say with all we've done? I think that would be very nice. The Democrats would say yes, if you'd like. We could cancel the election because we have no chance. But you know what? Hopefully they have no chance anyway, and hopefully you're going to remember what I just said because we were unjustly treated unjustly, accused by a bunch of treasonous crooks, a bunch of bad, bad people who got caught. And I think they'll have to pay a very substantial price. Yeah. When the plague arrived from China, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War Two. We pioneered lifesaving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April. You know, the question was asked to me, How well did we do on the pandemic? And I said, I give us an A to an A plus. You look at the ventilators. You look at all we've done. We did a great job. We helped the governors, the governor's. They're always very thankful. Then sometimes they get in front of a camera, they'll remember. Some of them are Democrats, right? But I said the only thing we did badly on his public relations because we were working so hard, we didn't think. I think frankly, they're not gonna cover it well, no matter what, But we did a hell of a job and then compares to Europe and we did very well. But now that Europe is exploding again, they don't want to talk about it. And neither do I. Because I want you. I want Europe to hell. I want the whole world to heal. But we've done a hell of a job except in public relations, and that's explaining it to people. On that. I give us a D, but we got an A plus in terms of what we've done through Operation Warp speed. We will develop and distribute the vaccine in record time by the end of the year, and it could be sooner than that. But we have the greatest labs, the greatest cos of that kind in the world and they are right there. They are right there is gonna be incredible. So there's gonna be a great vaccine and we have Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson Moderna. Another one just announced today these air great, great great companies. On November 3rd, Virginia will decide whether we end the pandemic on return to record prosperity or whether we allow Joe Biden to kill the recover, delay the vaccine, impose a $4 trillion tax icon you. That's what he wants to do. Ban American energy. He wants to ban fracking. How about that? He wants to ban Fracking. Then he looks into the nomination. You know, he shouldn't have gotten it, because if Pocahontas left two days early, Bernie would have won and we would've had Bernie. I don't know who I would have been better against. Maybe, who knows? But we would have had radical Bernie. But we're going to get a lot of Bernie votes like we did last night because his people agree with us on trade, except we're better at it than he is. So we're gonna get a lot of the Bernie votes. What? Bernie takes a hard shot doesn't. This is twice that happened, and he has such a nice attitude between him. And how about Bloomberg? Bloomberg gets absolutely decimated in the debate. Mini Mike Mini, Mike Mini Mike, hey gets decimated on in order to get back with the Democrat Party. I'm gonna put $100 million into Florida. If I were him. I just just take a pass. He doesn't have to give us anything way. Don't need his money. Just take a pass, you know? So he wants to buy his way into the Democrats on, So he's going down to Florida. It's, but unfortunately he did something that wasn't so good, right? He said, I'm gonna pay off all these fines of the prisoners. There's only one problem. It's illegal now. He's got himself a problem now. He's got himself a bigger problem than he had when Pocahontas beat the hell out of him in the debate. Ah, that wasn't so easy. Much remember she was going point after point after point and he thought she was talking about me. And so did I. Actually, and then and then what happened? She said. And I'm not talking about President Trump. I'm talking about you. And he went, Oh my God, he's not a good guys. Er, not a good guy, stupid to do that stupid, you have to have some pride. You can't go with the way they treated him so badly. You can't do that. But they're going to destroy the suburbs. You know, I keep hearing about suburban women like you write suburban women. Well, I just ended a regulation that would have allowed projects in your Do you mind having a project next year? How's your beautiful? You live in a beautiful house, right? Happily married, beautiful kids, everything perfect. The American dream, right? Do you mind having a project built next door? She said she minds. You know who minds, everybody minds. I just don't think anybody knows that we did this. I really don't. I don't think anybody knows. And they're gonna change the zoning that allows them to build projects in the suburbs. So the guys came to me. I said, I wanna end that They came. Sir, we're all set. We're going to really bring it back. I said no. I didn't say bring it back. I said I wanted to end it. Well, that's not so easy. I said I wanted to end it. I don't want it. I don't want it. And we terminated it so you can live happily ever after. If you vote for Trump. If you don't vote for Trump, you can forget it because they will put your nose in charge of it. Cory Booker Senator Cory Booker is another beauty. He was Elizabeth if you if you really think he had Elizabeth Warren had Cory Booker and you had Kamala, you know, if you pronounce her name wrong, she goes crazy. Kamala like a comma. It's like a comma. She's like a comma. And by the way, nobody treated Sleepy Joe worse than his vice presidential. I brilliantly said he'll never pick Kamala because he got treated. He got called the races he got called Xenophobic, which you didn't know what that meant. He got called all sorts of things right, And so I said, No, obviously not gonna be picked her. I couldn't believe it, but I think that's good. We like our mike Pence. We like Mike Okay, and she's rated further left. Then Bernie Sanders. I thought he was the most left in the He's not actually even in the party. He's sort of like an independent. Nobody ever used to say that, but he's like an independent, but she's rated further left than crazy. Bernie on. Uhh! This is what you want. I don't think so. Just So you understand if and then she calls it the Harris administration, along with Just like you're naming a movie. The producing credits right in the Harris administration along with Vice President Biden. No, no, no. He's heading up the ticket. But then he said the same thing. He put her name first. I've never done that. I love Mike. What I've never said Mike Pets and Donald Trump. I always say Trump, because you know what? You got to know that you're the president. He doesn't know that he's in first position. He doesn't know. He doesn't know. He forgot. He forgot. Hey, look, you're entitled to a mistake every once in a while. It was strange that they did it almost in the same hour, though, right? It was like one on top of another. Give free health care. They want to give free healthcare to illegal aliens and indoctrinate your Children with poisonous anti American lies in school. We don't like that to combat the toxic on. Do you see what it is? It's toxic left wing propaganda in our schools. I announced last week that we're launching a new pro American lesson plan for student called 17 76. Commissioner, we will teach our Children the truth about America. That we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. And we're getting better. Better? Better all the time. And we're joined tonight by a friend of ours. A warrior Congressman Rob Wittman. Good guy. Virginia Republican Party chair Rich Anderson. Could you? How we I'm not wasting my time here, Rich. I gotta ask him, Rich. What do you think? I think so, right? I think so. And congressional candidates? Nick Francis. Great. Look at him. We had a call the other day. Very successful. Call, right. Great call. Thanks, Dick. And a real warrior Riel hero Scott Taylor got that? Those are two very important races, and I think you're gonna win in my source of good polling. We're taking over the house from crazy Nancy. We're gonna have it. And I think those two guys, I think they're gonna win. Also somebody that I have heard incredible things about the Republican nominee for the U. S. Senate. Daniel Gade. There there. He's a good looking guy. And I'll tell you, he's gotta beat his opponent because he is just Water Warner was. You know he was talking about Russia, right? Trump and Russia. Russia. Russia. Then he gets scammed by a guy with the greatest Russian accent. You remember that, right? I have pictures off President Trump. Oh, really? Where? Where? Where? What are they like? Are they new pictures? Yes, yes, yes. Does Vladimir know? Yes. Yes, yes. So he's talking to this guy. Got scammed. Okay. It was a comedian or something. It was a comedian. He's allowed to talk to Russians. If I talked to a Russian. It's a terrible thing. By the way. You know, getting along with Russia is not the worst thing in the world. Does that make sense? Getting along with North Korea? Kim Jong Un And everyone said, Oh, he's getting along. He's giving so much. I said, What did he give? They couldn't tell me anything. You know what? I gave sanctions. That's what I gave. But you know what? We get along? We get along. You would have been in a war right now would have been a nuclear war. You would've been a war right now with North Korea. If it wasn't for May. Hillary Clinton didn't have a clue Obama didn't have a clue. Obama told me what? I sat with him the one time I sat with him. What's your biggest problem? North Korea? I said. How big? He said. It's a big problem. And he was indicating like it was a war. I said, Have you tried calling him? Have you tried? Have you given it a little shot? You know, instead of losing 10 million people, they used to say 50,000 people could be killed. No, 20 million people could be killed. Okay, 20 million soul is right next to you know, right near the border. It would be, uh, too bad. But we have, ah, good relationship. I get criticized because have relationships with these people. And that's a positive thing. We have to remember. That's a positive thing. And I had a very good relationship in China with President Xi. But you know what? This pandemic has Just we made a great trade deal, but it just doesn't mean the same to me. Does that make any sense? It doesn't mean to say it doesn't mean the same to me. Last week two weeks ago, they had the largest order of corn to our farmers in our history. They had the largest order of soybeans. They had this massive order of beef. But you know what it does just doesn't mean as much to me now as it did at one point. The ink wasn't even dry on the trade deal, and this thing came in and they could have stopped it. We're also deeply moved to be joined by two Gold Star spouses to incredible people. Karen Owens was a guest. at my first address to Congress as we honor the supreme sacrifice of her husband fallen Navy seal. Ryan Owens were scared. Come on up here. Come up. And also joined with Brittany Jacobs and her family. You know, Britney, On Memorial Day and 2017 I met Britney and her son Christian at Arlington National Cemetery. And we honored the memory of her incredible husband and Christians. Dad, Marine Sergeant Christopher Jacobs. We took a picture together. That little boy who is no longer a little boy. Come on over here. Come on. Come on Over here. The both of you. So Yep. Yeah. E e said, How's your beautiful, handsome boy? She said, Really good. But he wants to go back to school. Let's go open up the schools, open up the school. We've got about it. But we thank God every day for our courageous warriors and will always support are incredible Gold star families that we wanna thank Both of you. It's incredible. Thanks. I will get you back to school soon. Alright then I'm back. Come on, Governor. Let's go. You got other things that these people you know, they're keeping the state's close because they think it's gonna be harmful on November 3rd, and it's not really it's not gonna have too much of an impact. What it's doing is hurting a lot of people, though It's hurting a lot of people and everything we do. We're putting America first. We've spent the last four years reversing the terrible damage Joe Biden and his friends inflicted on this country over the last 47 years. I love it when he says We could have done this, we should have done that. The guy's been here forever 47 years, hard to believe right? And that was in prime time, although he never had super prime time. But that was in prime time, remember? And this time and now I got him here together. We've taken on a corrupt and broken system that's been throwing everything at us from the very beginning, a new trove of documents and you have to go home. You got to read these documents, and they now proved that Russia interfered in 2016. Unfortunately, it was on behalf of Hillary Clinton, not Trump. They interfere disinformation. Newly released text messages make 100% clear. The FBI knew that Democrats purchase Russian disinformation targeting me, your favorite president, which then form the basis for the witch hunt. And I'll tell you, we've had some incredible strength in terms of people like Sean Hannity, the great Lou Dobbs. Think of Laura Tucker. Tucker has been great The last third. Fox and friends. Janine. Janine. I'll tell you, Jesse, How about Jesse? Hey, Greg Gutfeld was bad to me. Now he's great to me. He said, Hey, would you rather have a nice guy that doesn't do anything or, ah, horrible human being like Trump that gets it done. They will say I'd rather have the horrible I'm not a horrible I'm a nicer guy always get very offended when they say about like, Well, maybe people don't like him, but he gets everything done. I think people like me, but I do get it done on more than any administration ever in 3.5 years. First rate E that so much, I'll tell you, that is so nice. That is so nice. The first you talk about the seating we're gonna don't worry about the justice will get her seat. Don't worry about that. And that's a nice. That's right. But you know, they say these people said they have never heard a political campaign. We're a big audiences. We love Trump or the candidate I've never heard of. I'm I've never heard it for Ronald Reagan and I like Ronald Reagan, but I've never heard it, and they've never heard it. Nobody's ever heard it. Who says that? But I love you, too. I really do when we're getting it done. No, they've never heard that chance. I've never heard it. And it started about two weeks ago. I've never heard it even before. But again before it is. Yeah, Yeah, I wanna thank you. It's really no, it's really nice. And we've got to go out, and we've got to really work hard. We've gotta watch this ballot scam because they're scamming us. Okay, they're scamming us on. Then They say he doesn't want to turn over governor. Of course they dio, but it's got to be a fair election, you know? See, that's that's another scam. They don't mention anything about ballots. I say got to be a fair election when they're losing ballots all over the place when they're losing ballots, that just happened to be trump ballots. You know, in Virginia, did you hear? In a very Democrat area, they sent two ballots to thousands of people, thousands or thousands of people. I just came out over the wires. So people in a Democrat area got two ballots instead of one. This is They had eight ballots and a wastepaper basket. Military ballots that all were for Trump. Everyone was for Trump, and they were in a wastepaper basket. They were thrown away. And somebody saw then they had many, many ballots thrown into a river. Some place I don't even know the state thes air. Just a few of them and then go back earlier. Go back to the Democrats primaries, go back to the Great State, Iowa. I love Iowa. We're gonna win Iowa. Big, big, big, big. We wanted last time by 11 points. We're gonna win it big with ethanol. What I've done for them with the $28 billion for the farmers on that includes you. That includes tobacco. That includes a lot of things, but that includes your farmers. But you go back to their primaries, right? Go back to the primary. The Iowa the first primary. It was done with ballots. They have no idea. Remember the disaster and that's a small primary. Now they're talking about tens of millions of these fake ballots going all over the place. Who's sending them? Where they being sent? Who's sending them back? Supposing they don't get him? Are they being sent to Democrat areas? And they're all run by Democrat governors, right? All of them, 100%. It's 100%. So you have a guy in Nevada? He just comes up with the idea I love. I think we're gonna win Nevada fairly. We're gonna win it, but he comes up Well, you don't have to have your signature verified. Oh, that's nice. That's good, he decided. Let's not do that. But you know, a real big problem. I like watching television and have the winner is right. You might not hear it for months because this is a mess. Go back and study what happened in Iowa. Take a look. Take a look at what happened in New York and a small congressional race. Carolyn Maloney. She should have lost the race, in my opinion, they gave it to her because it was a crooked deal. The guy, the guy that you ran against was having fits. He said, What are you doing? What are you doing? Everything was mixed up. The ballots were lost. There was fraud. There was everything go into Paterson, New Jersey. These air just recently. It's a disaster waiting to happen. And the only one that knows it better than we do are the Democrats. They know this is gonna happen. They wanted toe happen because they want to go through the court system. And instead, you're not gonna hear very unlikely that you're gonna hear Winner. That night, I could be leading and then they'll just keep getting ballots and ballots and ballots and ballots because now they're saying that the ballots could come in late. Well, what does that mean? And more importantly, they're gonna be given, in some cases, a week or two weeks to count the ballots. So if we're waiting for one state No, think of it. If we're waiting, this is they're talking about 567 states that have this problem. So if we're waiting for one state, does that mean the whole nation the whole world is gonna wait for one state. I won't use any names. But you have Pennsylvania where you have a Democrat who, by the way, lost the case last week. Way sued. We want him to open up his state and we won on Constitutional North Carolina. They have the state all locked up. So we're talking about these air, the governor's that run their states for Democrats. They really dio they run them the Democrat governors and they're in charge of the count. We went to Nevada to make a speech. We had five different sites. The governor made it impossible. So we ended up in a different site. We had to get one very thistles. The guy that's in charge of balance. He was a political hack. Now he's the governor, and this guy is in charge of ballots. It's not gonna work. It's gonna be a disaster. And I want a smooth, beautiful transition, but they don't add the other part. But it's gotta be an honest vote. And everybody knows just go back again. Look at Iowa. Look what happened. Just take a look at that. They still don't know who won. They didn't know. Weeks later. Remember New Hampshire went, New Hampshire declared a winner, and essentially, they don't know what happened in Iowa, except the difference is we're doing the same thing. But with tens of millions of ballots, this is a disaster waiting to happen, and they shouldn't let this system go. If you ask for a ballot is called Solicited, you solicit. You want the ballot, it comes in, you sign it, you send it back. That's OK. But where they send million's and million's off unsolicited ballots, people get ballots. I didn't even know they were getting them. Sign it, sign it then there, people going around getting in design. You know, when you have that, you don't need it. We have much more enthusiasm were so high up on enthusiasm, right? But it's very unfair because when you have somebody go knock on your door sign, it's called harvesting. They're gonna harvest ballots, even though in some cases in most cases it's illegal, it's illegal is hell and it should be illegal. So this is a disaster waiting to happen, and the only hope we have really other than going through a long, unbelievable litigation at the end, after it's over, because we're gonna win. We're not gonna lose this. Except if they cheat. That's the way I look at it. We can't let him cheat. We can't let him. It's too much. Our country is at stake, and that's true. Our country is at stake because these people will destroy our country. We can't let this happen and this is a scam. They know it. The media knows it, but the media doesn't want to cover it. They know exactly what's gonna happen, and so do I. But the Democrats no better than all of us. What's gonna happen so we can't let it. And if you see anything, you just have to report it and everything. We're all watching law enforcement's watching all over the place, but it's very hard to watch, you know, millions of ballots very hard to watch on. Uhh. It's the only way we're gonna That's the only way we're gonna lose is if there's mischief, mischief, and it'll have to be on a big scale. So be careful and we do want a very friendly transition. But we don't want to be cheated and be stupid and say, Oh, let's transit well, we'll go and we'll do a transition, and we know that there were thousands and thousands of ballots that made the difference through cheating. We're not going to stand for it. We're not going to stand. So just remember, keep your eyes up. For decades, our opponents spent trillions of dollars rebuilding other countries. And now we're finally rebuilding our country. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U. S. Military, all made in the Yusa. We launched the first new branch of the armed forces. Think of that since the Air Force 75 years ago. It's called Space Force. It's a big deal. See, that alone would be a big deal. For honestly, that alone would be a very big deal for a administration. We did think of it. We now have a six branch of the United States armed forces. That's a big deal. But we did so much more so much more. I think of it. It's incredible, you know, we did probably the most well, have maybe even more than 300 federal judges, including Court of Appeals. And now we're gonna have three Supreme Court judges, their minds air blowing their mind. You know, you've had many presidents never had one Supreme Court judge. We're gonna have three of all people, and that's a record of all people to get three Supreme Court justices in one administration In one term, they are going crazy. They're saying, Darling, tell me this is not happening, but you'll see tomorrow at five o'clock the Incredible Workers of Newport News on Norfolk Naval Shipyard, we will build 355 were going toe have, Ah, a Navy again of 355 ships. That's what we need that's been depleted and they're already being built. We got a We've got a few big ones. Beauties being built, including aircraft carriers. Biden will slash military funding and shipbuilding will be shut down. It's gonna be shut down like it used to be. We killed the founder and leader of Isis al Baghdadi. We took out the world's number one terrorist and mass murderer. Solemn mating. I withdrew from last administrations. Disastrous Iran Nuclear catastrophe. What a deal that was $150 billion. 1.8 billion in cash. You ever see what 1.8 billion in cash? It's planeloads. These guys over there. They must have said. What the hell is this? They never saw money like that. We paid, you know. We got for it. Nothing. Nothing. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jesus. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They've been working on that for 52 years. I got it done quickly and instead of endless wars were forging peace in the Middle East. We even got nominated, right? You know what for? That's right. I hate to talk about it, but I have to because the press doesn't talk about it now. It Z, that was a great honor. It was a great honor twice. You know that, right? Twice. The press doesn't talk. The Nobel Peace Prize, huh? You too? For different Kosovo and Serbia, We stop them from killing each other. It was very nice. And they don't have to kill each other. Be killing each other for a long time. Kosovo survey. It was great. It was great. And we got a nomination for Israel. You look at Bahrain. Um e. That's just the beginning. We have them lined up that wanna go into that? Well, peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand. I told you, you you heard the story. I went home. I said, First lady, I'm going to get the greatest stories tonight. I just got nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. First lady, Israel. Everybody said it couldn't be done and they were right. It couldn't be done the way they were doing it. You would have never gotten it done the way John Kerry was doing it. You would have never gotten as a guy. Doesn't have a clue in confidence. But you know what I said, First lady, Where do you see this? It's gonna be unbelievable. And we watched Lester Holt. I don't even know why. And we had one story after another after another. And after seven stories, I said, First lady, this is getting a little embarrassing. And they never mentioned that. Nor did any other of the newscasts fake. CNN didn't mention it. MSD NC didn't imagine ABC, CBS. Nobody mentioned it, so I was very embarrassed. Three days later, I got dominated again, right? And I said, My great first lady, we got another shot at it. Darling, let's watch the news tonight one story. Two stories. Three stories. 4 35 cents. We got to the end. It wasn't mentioned again, and when Barack Hussein Obama was nominated, it was and he didn't know what he got it for. He still doesn't. So we have a little double standard going. But that's OK. As long as we know. Sometimes I'll be talking that way and I'll look around. I'll say, Oh, I'm in the Oval Office. How did that happen? I said, You know, with all the complaining were in the Oval Office and they're not right. And if you don't mind, let's keep it that way so we can keep this going. We've achieved more in 47 months and Joe Biden has achieved in 47 years. It's true. Biden, without even knowing it, is pushing the most far left platform in history. The Biden plan would destroy Social Security and destroy protection for people with pre existing conditions. He would terminate our travel bans and jihadist regions. You know, I got the travel ban, remember? Everyone said you couldn't do that. I want to travel ban from people that want to blow up our country. Do you think that's okay? People said, Oh, we don't like that took a little heat and we got it. They said I didn't get it and they were right. We lost it. One court lost in the second. Then we won in the Supreme Court. They don't say that, but we have a strong travel ban on way will use it. We do use it. We use it plenty and increased refugee admissions. They want to increase refugee admission 700% Opening the floodgates for radical Islamic terrorism. They want to ban school choice and charter schools in the second term. I will provide school choice to every parent in America. Vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities. Great jobs and a limitless future for all Americans is so true. And in conclusion. And I love you people. But I've been doing this since early in the morning. I'm getting the hell out of here. I would only do this for you. I got a guy stays in his damn basement all day long and I'm doing this. I don't know if he wins. Are gonna be very embarrassed. I'll say T I worked so hard and he didn't work at all. Now we're gonna win. I think we're gonna win. I think we're gonna win big. I think we're going. I think we're gonna win bigger than anyone understands. I think there's a boat out there. There's a hidden vote out there. The pulses air fake. They're controlled by the same people. The right, the bad stories, the fake stories. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults and law enforcement on we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. Banham Way will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Virginia, we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens. And we will keep America out of the ridiculous, horrible, endless foreign wars countries that you've never even heard of. You will keep you out of them. And by the way, we have weapons the likes of which nobody has ever seen. We have a level of the degree of which nobody from Russia to China to North Korea. Nobody's ever seen what we built and just hope to God. We never have to use them. But we have never had anything like the arsenal that we've built over the last three years hope to God we never have to use with the envy of the world. In that way, we have the greatest. We have the greatest people for a building. There's nobody can do what we can do. There's nobody. But when I came in, your military was totally depleted. You had old planes, you had old. Everything we have now the F 30 fives and way have things. The bombers, the new bombers, the tankers, the ships that we're building some right here, new partners, Yeah, but we have built in Arsenal, the likes of which the world has never seen. And you know what? That will make it a lot easier for us not to have to use them. That's really what we need. We needed it. We were in bad shape. We were in bad shape. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. And that's what we've done. We will end surprise medical building, require price transparency and further reduce health insurance. You know, the health insurance is a disaster and we are bringing the price of health insurance. Way down. Premiums and costs of prescription drugs were instituting favorite nations. We pay the highest in the world for drugs. I negotiated with Big Farmer and I just got tired of negotiating. I said, I'm sorry. We're instituting favorite nations. We're the largest purchaser of prescription drugs by far in the world. And I instituted what we call a favored Nations clause where we will pay the same price as the nation that pays the lowest price in the world. Okay, In addition to that, I instituted a rebate close where we get the rebates instead of the middle men thes air the richest people. I don't know who the hell they are, but the middle men are. They're very rich and they're not liking me too much. And you're gonna see a lot of bad ads from Big Pharma. They've already started. Just remember, every time you see one of those ads, that means you're drug prices air coming way down, and I mean by 50 60 70 and 80% will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security. We will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. Always, always America will land. The first woman in the moon in the United States will be the first nation to land and astronaut on Mars happening quickly. And we've taken NASA from fairways. Grayer. I mean, you have to see they had fairways along like a golf course. It was a better golf course that it was a runway and what we've done, we've taken all the grass at it was grass growing right through the cracks. It was a disgrace, and we've now made it the number one space center in the world by far again, You had to see this. They were playing golf. They were playing golf, was all closed up or essentially closed up. It was actually worse than closed up. You know what? It was sort of open, but nobody was doing anything. They had nothing to do. We have the greatest scientists in the world and we're letting rich guys send up rockets. We like it somehow. Rich people like to send rockets up. We say just pay us a nice rent and have a lot of fun sending your rockets are. But NASA is now number one in the world again by far, and there's no content and all that grass is gone. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students on restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our Children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. Are you listening? NFL? Are you listening? N f l e and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto. In God we trust. For years you had a president who apologize for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Virginia and North Carolina s o. Get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your co workers and get out and vote. There's never been a more important election than this election. Early voting has already begun. Do not wait. Go out and vote from Richmond to run up from Fredrik Berg's to Williamsburg and from North walk to right here in new Partners. We stand on the shoulders of Virginia Patriots who gave their blood sweat and tears For this beloved nation, Virginia is the place that gave us George Washington. Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe. Now, you know, I signed a little document 10 years in prison. If you knock down a statue or among you, it doesn't matter. It's amazing how you haven't seen any of that lately. They were having a little fun, and now they were heading toward the Jefferson Memorial. I said, Wait a minute on. I predicted that they were knocking down statues. A lot of people didn't know exactly which one. I said. You better stop it because the next thing you know, they'll knock down the statue of Robert E. Lee. And they did. I said, You better stop it or they'll be going after Thomas Jefferson and Washington and Abe Lincoln and they started. And I said, What are we going to do here, have some good people? They said, you know, because today in Congress you can't get anything done give you one day in a very nice hotel. So I said, What are we going to do? They said, We'll take out an old we'll take out an old law and you can reinstitute it with an executive order. I said, was it say 10 years in prison, not jail. They use the word prison, I said, for what? You knock down a monument or a statue, You go to jail for 10 years. I said, give me that thing. Get into my office and make it. And I signed it and they were coming down to Washington. They were gonna knock down to particular statues that were really beautiful. And I signed it and we announced it had a news conference, Gonna let people know about it. Right? And the 20,000 person march turned out to be about three people, arrested. Actually, because we have thanks to the fake news, we have a lot of footage of people standing on the statue of Jackson Andrew Jackson. Remember? They almost had the ropes. We sent in the police. The police did a great job, by the way. Remember that? The ropes, they're ready to pull it down. And we said charged and they charged and I want to tell you they did a hell of a job. They were much tougher than the people with ropes. It took them about two minutes, and that was the end of the ropes. But it was close. They got there just in time. But you know what? Since I signed that, there's been no statues. No monuments that have been played with federal Federal states have to do the same thing for their states. Virginia heroes made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country. And together we're taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and your drive. We're going to keep on working. We're going to keep on fighting. And we're going to keep on winning. Winning, winning, win, win, win. We're one movement, one people, one family on one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Virginia and North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again. Way will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Virginia. Thank you. Get out and vote. Thank you.",

         "Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Well, I want to thank Chris and Wayne. I'm thrilled to be here in Indiana with the men and women of the NRA. You are great American patriots. (Applause.) Chris Cox, Wayne LaPierre, Oliver North , I've been following Oliver for a long time. Great guy. Three extraordinary champions for the Second Amendment. And I'm a champion for the Second Amendment and so are you. It's not going anywhere. (Applause.) It's under assault. It's under assault but not when we're here. Not even close. I also want to thank our tremendous Vice President and Indiana's native son. Mike Pence has done a fantastic job. (Applause.) And we're grateful to be joined by a number of terrific leaders from the Hoosier State: Governor Eric Holcomb. Where is Eric? You can't miss Eric. He's so big. (Applause.) Thank you, Eric. Senator Todd Young, terrific guy. (Applause.) Thank you, Todd. Senator Mike Braun. What a job he's doing. (Applause.) And Representative Greg Pence , familiar name. Thank you, Greg. (Applause.) Jackie Walorski. Jackie, thank you. (Applause.) Jim Baird and Jim Banks , great representatives. Thank you all very much. (Applause.) Tremendous help. Tremendous. I also want to recognize Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt. What a job he's been doing. David, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) A great friend of mine, Kentucky Governor, Matt Bevin. (Applause.) Thank you, Matt. And the House GOP Whip , a man with more courage than most of us here today. He took some very, very severe shots , you know that , by a madman. And he's stronger and better. I actually told him backstage, I said, 'You're much more handsome than you were two years ago.' I don't know what's going on. And he is. Steve Scalise. A lot of courage. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Steve. Most importantly, I want to thank all of you, the proud, card-carrying members of the NRA. (Applause.) Every day, you stand up for our God-given rights without exception, without fail, and without apology. Together, we are fighting for the timeless values that have built and sustained our nation. And our nation is greater today than it has ever been. Stronger, richer. We're doing better than ever before. We are great Americans. You're doing a great job. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. We believe in the rule of law. And we will always protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. (Applause.) And there are some people that are running right now; I don't think they have that number one on their list. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. (Applause.) And we believe in the right to self-defense and the right to protect your family, your community, and your loved ones. We believe in the wisdom of our Founders. And we believe in freedom and liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) We know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. And above all else, we know this: In America, we don't worship government; we worship God. (Applause.) Every day of my administration, we are taking power out of Washington, D.C. and returning it to the American people, where it belongs. (Applause.) And you see it now better than ever, with all of the resignations of all of the bad apples. They're bad apples. They tried for a coup; didn't work out so well. (Applause.) And I didn't need a gun for that one, did I? (Laughter.) All was taking place at the highest levels in Washington, D.C. You've been watching, you've been seeing. You've been looking at things that you wouldn't have believed possible in our country. Corruption at the highest level , a disgrace. Spying, surveillance, trying for an overthrow. And we caught them. We caught them. (Applause.) Who would have thought in our country? But it's called what we all together have done , started two and a half years ago on that great November 8th. That was a great day. Remember that day? (Applause.) Great day. And in a year and a half, we have one called 'November 3rd.' It's November 3rd this time. Get ready to vote. You better. You better get ready to vote. But it's all called 'draining the swamp,' and we are doing it faster than anyone ever thought possible. Very proud of that. (Applause.) And around the world, America is respected again because we are finally putting America first. Been a long time. Our economy is now the hottest anywhere on the planet Earth. Just this morning, we learned that the GDP smashed expectations, with the economy growing at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter , always the worst quarter for whatever reason. 3.2. (Applause.) And if we kept the same interest rates and the same quantitative easing that the previous administration had, that 3.2 would have been much higher than that. But they hadn't hit these numbers in 16 years. We had a tremendous increase in inventory investment. You know what that means. And , listen to this , a very big increase in net exports. Isn't it about time? Isn't that nice? (Applause.) We've added almost 6 million jobs since my election. And if I would have said that during the campaign, all of those people back there , we call them the 'fake news' , they wouldn't have believed it. They're fake. They're fake. Blue-collar jobs recently grew at the fastest rate in more than three decades. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps since our election. (Applause.) Wages are rising fast, and the lowest-paid workers are making the biggest percentage gains of all. And that's nice to hear. It's about time. (Applause.) Unemployment recently achieved its lowest rate in 51 years, and very shortly, it should be its lowest rate in the history of our country. (Applause.)African American, Asian American, Hispanic American , have reached the lowest levels of unemployment in our history. (Applause.) America's future has never been brighter, and yet Democrats have never been angrier, especially now that their 'collusion delusion' has been exposed to the world as a complete and total fraud. (Applause.) It's been the greatest political hoax ever in our country. Instead of working with us to rebuild our infrastructure, lower drug prices , which, by the way, this year, for the first time in 50 years, drug prices went down. (Applause.) They're going to go down a lot lower. And instead of working with us to fix our trade deals , which I'm doing without them , and continue creating millions and millions of new jobs, which we're doing at a level that people have not seen before, that people don't even believe, Democrats are obsessed with hoaxes, delusions, and witch hunts. It's what they're obsessed with. That's what they want to do. And we can play the game just as well or better than they do. (Applause.) Far-left radicals in Congress want to take away your voice, your jobs, your rights, and they especially want to take away your guns. You know that. They want to take away your guns. You better get out there and vote. You better get out there and vote. It seems like it's a long ways away. It's not. I was saying to Melania, our great First Lady, whose birthday it is today. Happy birthday, Melania! (Applause.) I remember standing, two and a half years ago, in the same hallway where Abraham Lincoln and so many others have stood. My first night in the White House and I said to Melania , I said, 'This is incredible.' And four years seemed so long away. And now here we are. We're getting ready to start up the campaign again. Start up the campaign again. (Applause.) I never want to do anything with MAGA because MAGA country and MAGA , 'Make America Great Again' has been great, but we've really made it great. We've made it great. We've brought it back. And we're thinking about , slogan: 'Keep America Great.' Because you have socialists and far-left Democrats that want to destroy everything that we've done. Your 401(k)s are going through the roof. Your stock market, since the election, has hit a record high. Almost a hundred different records I've broken. Record high. But everyone is like a genius now. They buy stock and they're all up. Everybody is benefitting and jobs are benefitting. But it can all be taken away when you start putting the wrong people in office. We've cut regulations more than any President in the history our country. And that's in two years. In two years, we did more to regulation , (applause) , think of that , than any President in the history of our country. It's one of the reasons our jobs are booming; one of the reasons the economy is booming. We gave you the largest tax cut in the history of our country. The biggest, ever. (Applause.) And we got ANWR approved. And we got the individual mandate, the absolute worst part of Obamacare, eliminated. Now we're going for the rest. (Applause.) And we had it done except for one vote. You know what I'm talking about. One vote. In recent days, leading Democrats have proposed banning new guns and confiscating existing guns from law-abiding citizens. What they don't tell you is the bad guys aren't giving up their guns. And you're not going to be giving up your guns either. (Applause.) At the same time, House Democrats recently voted against notifying ICE , these brave, great, talented, brilliant patriots , when an illegal alien attempts to buy a gun, which is a felony. Democrats also support sanctuary cities that release thousands of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. In fact, they like the criminal aliens and aliens so much that when we're forced to release them into our country because of the horrible immigration laws that the Democrats refuse to give us the votes , we need some of their votes to change , we give them as many as they can handle. (Applause.) And they're not too happy about it, folks. They're not too happy. They said, 'Who came up with that idea?' (Laughter.) They said, 'Only Trump could come up with that idea.' (Laughter and applause.) We give them as many as they can handle. In other words, Democrats want to disarm law-abiding Americans while allowing criminal aliens to operate with impunity. But that will never happen as long as I'm your President. Not even close. (Applause.) I promise to defend the Second Amendment rights of every American, and I always will. I'll never let you down. (Applause.) Never let you down. I haven't so far, and I won't. Because as the famous saying goes, when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Very simple. (Applause.) The Democrats are also working hard to block the wall, but we are building the wall. They're not happy about it. And we will have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. (Applause.) We're building a lot of wall, and I want to thank Border Patrol. I want to thank our great military. And I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers. They've been incredible. And we are doing something that I could do very quickly, and we're doing it very quickly. But dealing with these people is very, very difficult, if you haven't noticed, okay? Any politician would've given up a long time ago. So we'll have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. It's going up rapidly. Rapidly. (Applause.) We're also renovating tremendous stretches of wall. We have wall that's in bad shape but it's structurally sound. And rather than building new, we renovate it. We make it as good as new, save a lot of money, and we gain a lot of territory. So we have a lot of great things going. A lot of great things going. (Applause.) Most importantly, Democrats must change our immigration laws right now. Right now. We can do it in , I used to say 45 minutes. We can do it in 15 minutes. It's very simple. You know the programs; they're horrible. The asylum , where rough, tough MS-13 gang members come in. You don't want to meet with these people, but ICE doesn't mind because ICE is throwing them out of our country by the thousands. And the Democrats want to eliminate ICE. Can you believe that? (Applause.) Boy, oh, boy. But it's incredible what they've done. It's incredible what we've done. But they stand there , asylum , and they read a statement, 'I am afraid for my life. I am afraid to go back to my country. I want to be an American!' And you look and you see a toughness that you don't see. And you just see what happens with the mayor of Tijuana and others. They say, 'These people, we try and help them, and they start hitting us. They start punching us.' We don't want them in our country, and they're not getting into our country. And when they have in the past , a lot of them have come in , we're throwing them the hell out. They're out. We're getting them out. (Applause.) But we can fix the problem so easy. And when we fix the problem , the wall is one thing. And that will have an incredible impact. But they won't even be coming up if we change our old, broken, ridiculous, weak immigration laws. They won't even be coming up. They won't make the journey. The wall is still good to have. We need the wall. But all of those people you see coming up , thousands and thousands of people , they won't be coming because they're going to say, 'There's no way we can get into the United States anymore, except by going through legal channels.' And what we want is we want people. We need them for all of the great companies that are coming in. But people have to come into our country legally and through merit. Through merit. (Applause.) One of the gravest threats to the Second Amendment, and to American freedom itself, are activist judges. You see it every day. Every day. They almost always file in a certain little jurisdiction; I won't tell you what it is, but you all know. Every time we get sued on the ban, which we ended up winning , you know, we have the ban. We lost in the Ninth Circuit; we shouldn't have. We lost in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which we shouldn't have. And we won at the United States Supreme Court. So we have the ban. Travel ban. But the reporters , the other day, some reporter said, 'Donald Trump, who lost the travel ban ' I didn't lose it. Well, what he meant: I lost it in the Ninth Circuit. But he didn't say we won at the United States Supreme Court. So everybody said, 'Oh, that's too bad. He lost the ' No, no. We won the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court. (Applause.) But they don't say that. So when we confronted them, they said, 'No, we were referring to the lower courts.' I said, 'What about the upper court? They ruled. It's done.' 'Well, we weren't talking about the Supreme Court. We were saying you lost ' These are very, very dishonest people, okay? (Applause.) Nobody gets it. Why? They're opposed to strong military. They're opposed to all of the things we've done, including making our nation wealthy, including high GDPs, including all of the security and all of the law enforcement, all of the things we're doing. It's incredible. Nobody understands it. Someday, we're going to figure it out, and I'll feel much better about it. But why are they opposed to things that truly make our country great? Why? Nobody gets it. I don't get it. The level of dishonesty and corruption in the media is unbelievable. (Applause.) But we're stuck with activist judges who seek to rewrite our Constitution to force their own radical views onto our country.That is why my administration has led a historic effort to confirm fair and impartial and mostly conservative judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. (Applause.) And I'm very proud to announce that we will soon have 145 federal judges confirmed , a record number , including two great Supreme Court judges , (applause) , Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh. (Applause.) Two fantastic justices. In fact, next week, we will confirm our 100th federal judge. Nobody knows what that means. The percentage is incredible. Nobody knows what that means. And in the end, I expect to have the second-highest percentage of judges confirmed in the history of the United States , more than any other President, except one , I'll never beat this one , percentage of judges approved. You know who the one is? Take a guess. George Washington. He gets 100 percent. (Applause.) No, he had 100 percent. He named every one of them. But you know what? We'll have more of them. George Washington. But we're also defending free speech on our college campuses. (Applause.) Last month, I signed an executive order requiring public colleges and universities to respect the First Amendment rights of their students, or risk losing tens of billions of dollars in federal funding. If you don't want to hear another voice, you don't get all of this tremendous amount , in some cases, ridiculous amounts of dollars. (Applause.) And we have shut down the previous administration's massive abuse of power known as Operation Choke Point. (Applause.) Under this ill-advised program, government bureaucrats discouraged banks from making loans to gun retailers , a backdoor attack on private gun ownership that will never be allowed to happen on my watch. That's step one, folks. (Applause.) Step one. You know what step two, three, and four is. Step four is: You don't have guns. You don't have any way to protect yourself. Today, I'm proud to announce another historic step to protect your Second Amendment rights. And I didn't tell Chris and Wayne and Oliver; I didn't even tell them about it. So they're listening in this big room someplace, and they're saying,'I wonder what he's going to do.' The good thing with me: You never know. (Laughter and applause.) Never know. That's why we're making trade deals that are so good for our country. So, in the last administration, President Obama signed the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. And in his waning days in office, he sent the treaty to the Senate to begin the ratification process. This treaty threatened your subjugate , and you know exactly what's going on here , your rights and your constitutional and international rules and restrictions and regulations. Under my administration, we will never surrender American sovereignty to anyone. (Applause.) We will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedom. And that is why my administration will never ratify the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. I hope you're happy. (Applause.) I'm impressed; I didn't think too many of you would really know what it is. You what it is? A big, big factor. But I see a couple of very happy faces from the NRA over there. And I am officially announcing today that the United States will be revoking the effect of America's signature from this badly misguided treatment . We're taking our signature back. (Applause.) The United Nations will soon receive a formal notice that America is rejecting this treaty. (Applause.) As part of this decision, I will sign right now, in front of a lot of witnesses , a lot , (applause) , it's a lot of witnesses , a message asking the Senate to discontinue the treaty ratification process and to return the now-rejected treaty right back to me, in the Oval Office, where I will dispose of it. (Applause.) By taking these actions, we are reaffirming that American liberty is sacred and that American citizens live by American laws, not the laws of foreign countries. Thank you. (Applause.) They all want the pen. Can you believe these people? (Laughter.) Should I give it to them? Famous pen. As we protect gun rights for law-abiding citizens, we are also getting guns out of the hands of violent criminals. When I took office two years ago, one of my highest priorities was to reduce violent crime. In the two years before my inauguration, the murder rate had increased by more than 20 percent, and the United States had experienced the largest increase in violent crime in over 25 years. For this reason, my administration resurrected Project Safe Neighborhoods, bringing together prosecutors, police, sheriffs, and citizens groups to put the most dangerous offenders behind bars. We funded 200 new violent crime prosecutors. We charged a record number of criminal offenders. And last year, we prosecuted the most violent criminals ever in our history. And now, violent crime is way down. Murders in America's largest cities dropped by 6 percent between 2017 and 2018. But I do have to ask you: What the hell is going on in Chicago? What is going on? (Applause.) We could solve that problem. We would've been down even a lot more. And it's not a tough problem to solve. You got to let law enforcement do what they have to do. They'll solve the problem very quickly. Very quickly. (Applause.) We don't think enough about the victims. They're too worried about the people that cause the crime. It's got to stop. That thought process is no good. The number of police officers shot and killed in the line of duty last year, I'm so happy to report, is down 21 percent compared to the year before. (Applause.) And that was the year before I took office. One of the reasons is that we are supplying police with surplus military equipment, supplies, and gears that the previous administration refused to give up. This is surplus. This is extra. We don't need it. Great equipment. Sitting in warehouses all over the country. Billions of dollars of equipment that the military no longer needs or wants or uses, but the top of the line. Some of it has never been used , brand new , from vehicles to, essentially, supplies of all kind, including bulletproof vests. And rather than having it sit and draw dust, I had it distributed all over the country to our police departments. (Applause.) And that's why you see these numbers. It's a great thing. You know, a lot of being President is common sense, right? Don't you think? Right? Common sense. (Applause.) Have a good heart, but it's common sense. In this administration, we will always stand with the heroes of law enforcement. They're heroes. (Applause.) They're brave. They're great. And they will tell you they haven't felt so proud of themselves for many years, because they were abandoned by Washington. They were abandoned by our politicians. And not just the Obama administration , before that. They felt abandoned. Well, they know that I love them, and we're going to protect them just like they protect us. (Applause.) Incredible people. Great people. We've also taken critical steps to improve school safety. More than 30 states now allow teachers that are highly trained , highly trained, talented people , to carry guns in the classroom to protect themselves and to protect their students, who they love. (Applause.) Who's better? Who's better? I've been calling for that for the last two years, and I think we had a big impact. Some legislations passed, and they don't have the few paragraphs, and the legislators actually go back to governors and say, 'We're not passing it unless you allow that to happen.' So we've come a long way. But who's better to protect our students than the teachers that love them? Through STOP School Violence grants, we are helping local schools and police departments to hire more officers, train more teachers, and address early warning signs of mental illness. (Applause.) Every day, citizens across America exercise their constitutional right to defend themselves, their families, and their communities. That's a constitutional right. (Applause.) They want to take it away from you. They will take it away. You let these maniacs get into office, they will take that right away. I mean, you see what's going on. 'Let the Boston bomber vote. He should be voting.' Right? I don't think so. 'Let terrorists that are in prison vote.' I don't think so. Can you believe it? But this is where some of these people are coming from. And they're the most popular ones. When Bernie Sanders made certain statements the other day, I said, 'Well, that's the end of his campaign.' Then, what happened is everybody agreed with him. (Laughter.) Or most of them. We know that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. (Applause.) Now, I wanted to be a little bit more original than to use a phrase that you probably heard a thousand times. But what's a better phrase than that? We can't do better. How simple is that? Today, I want to give a few of these brave citizens the chance to share their stories directly with the American people. A lot of television back there. Of course, when I start going after them, you watch those red lights go off. They don't want any part of it. They turn those lights. Then they come back. They need the ratings. (Laughter and applause.) They come back. In fact, at a certain point, I think they'll probably all endorse me, because would they be dead without me? Can you imagine? Can you imagine having some nice, boring person get up here? Well, they wouldn't be up here. They would be as far away from you as possible. (Applause.) April Evans joins us from Virginia. One night in 2015, she was home alone with her two-year-old daughter when an intruder broke into her home violently. April took care of it. April, please come up. Please, April. (Applause.) Thank you, April. She was able to defend herself. Also with us is Mark Vaughan, who owns a meat processing plant in Oklahoma. When an employee began attacking coworkers with a knife viciously and violently, Mark drew his gun and ended the assault immediately, saving countless innocent lives. Mark, please come up. (Applause.) Thank you, Mark. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Finally, Stephen Willeford joins us from Sutherland Springs, Texas , great state of Texas , (applause) , where a mass shooter opened fire at the First Baptist Church , you all read about it , in November 2017, taking many innocent lives. Wonderful, wonderful people. Stephen heroically risked his life to bring the horrible violence to an end. Stephen, please come up and say a few words. (Applause.) Wow, what a job. Thank you. Thank you. Can't say it better than that. But I want to thank you all for your courage, because you're really living proof that law-abiding gun owners make a tremendous, tremendous difference. Tremendous difference. You know, Paris, France, they say, has the strongest gun laws in the world. And you remember those maniacs, when they went into the nightclub. I use this example. There are many examples. But they shot one person, another person, another person, another person. Hundreds of people dead and horribly wounded to this day. That was five years ago. If there was one gun being carried by one person on the other side, it very well could have been a whole different result. The shooting went on so long and there wasn't a thing you could do about it. 'Get over here.' Boom. 'Get over here.' Boom. And then they left. They were captured later. If there was only one gun. If there were two, three, four, it wouldn't have happened. Tiny percentage, by comparison. But it probably wouldn't have happened because the cowards would've known there are people in there having guns. Wouldn't have happened. So people don't really understand the other side of the argument. I have the debate a lot, and I win the debate all the time. And the next day, you see the same person who was so badly defeated in the debate going out and saying the same thing, even though he or she, I really believe, know that you can't justify their side of the argument. So, gun owners make our communities safer and they make our nation stronger. Americans have always understood this truth, going back to the earliest days of our nation. Two months before the American Revolution broke out, with the shot heard around the world, a group of patriots gathered along a bridge in Salem, Massachusetts. In the preceding months, British soldiers had confiscated muskets in Boston. You know the story well. Gunpowder was seized in Somerville. And the patriots in Salem knew that the Redcoats would soon come for the town's cannons. But the Americans were prepared , they already loved our country , and they were determined to defend their rights to the death. When hundreds of British soldiers arrived at the bridge, the Americans stood firm, blocking their path. When swords were drawn, they didn't flinch. When the Redcoats tried to steal American boats, the patriots sank those boats and sank them very quickly. When a British soldier held the tip of his bayonet against a man's chest, that man , Joseph Whicher , tore open his shirt and dared him to do his worst. Soon, the crowd grew larger, as civilians came from miles around to stand side by side with their great countrymen against tyranny. In the face of such unbreakable resolve, the King's soldiers had no choice but to admit defeat and failure and retreat. In the courageous actions of those early Americans, we see the defiant and determined spirit of patriotism that has always willed America to its greatest victories. It is a spirit that is passed down from generation to generation, from fathers and mothers to sons and daughters. It is the spirit that lives in each and every one of you. Our duty, our responsibility, our sacred charge, is to preserve the freedoms that our ancestors gave their very lives to secure. Because no matter how many centuries go by, no matter how much the world changes, the central drama of human history remains the same. On one side are those who seek power, control, and domination. And on the other side are patriots like those in this hall who stand upright and plant their feet in eternal defense of our liberty. And with God as our witness, we swear today that we will defend our rights, we will safeguard our freedoms, we will uphold our heritage, we will protect our Constitution, and we will make America stronger, prouder, safer, and greater than ever, ever, ever before! (Applause.) To all of our incredible friends at the NRA: Thank you for fighting the good fight. It is an honor to fight by your side, and it's an honor to be with everyone in this giant hall today. I am with you. I will never, ever let you down. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)",

         "Well, thank you all for being here. And I'm especially grateful to the distinguished leaders in healthcare, drug abuse and prevention in this state, as well as some great friends and a great colleague from our nation's capital. It's great to be back home in Indiana. We've had a great couple of days. I was yesterday on the east side of Indianapolis, talking about creating jobs with the largest new trade deal in American history. I had a chance to stop by an elementary school in my hometown because they invited me earlier today. A third grade class at Southside Elementary asked me to come in, and we've kind of been pen pals for a while. And that was a great thrill. I stopped by to see our troops at Camp Atterbury, who are preparing to deploy. But I have to tell you, it is a joy for me to be back here at the NeuroDiagnostic Institute, which is an extraordinary statement about Indiana's leadership in the whole area of mental health and also in combatting opioid abuse and addiction. I specifically want to thank the Surgeon General of the United States , my friend, Dr. Jerome Adams , for being here and for his tremendous work on combatting opioid abuse and addiction. We are encouraged that, nationwide, in the last year we've seen a 5 percent reduction in overdose deaths from opioid abuse. And it is a beginning of progress, but one that our administration and I know Dr. Adams is absolutely determined to continue to build on that. But we're grateful that you'd be here with us, and thank you for your service to the country. I'm also grateful to be joined by a former colleague of mine when I had my last job in this state. Dr. Jennifer Sullivan is now the head of Indiana Family and Social Services. And this NeuroDiagnostic Institute is a project of the state of Indiana, and Community East really represents the very best of a public and private partnership. And, Dr. Sullivan, I want to thank you for your great leadership in helping to bring it about. Also, I want to congratulate Dr. Jerry Sheward for his great work here. He's the superintendent and the chief medical officer here at NDI, and, I think as of this spring, stood up this extraordinary institution, which is, in fact, the first mental health hospital constructed in the state of Indiana in a half a century. And it was my great privilege to break ground at this site in my last year as Governor of the state of Indiana. And to be back here, Dr. Sheward and Dr. Sullivan, and to see this magnificent building, which is already meeting the needs of patients, is a great tribute to your efforts, to your leadership, and to the leadership the state of Indiana has brought to this project. I'm grateful, as a Vice President of the United States, to see a state leading on a renewed commitment to mental health. But I'm also proud, as a Hoosier, to see the state of Indiana really creating a model for other communities and other states around the nation to address the challenges that we face from not only drug abuse and addiction, but also the challenges that mental health pose to public safety. And I want to speak about that in our roundtable today. I want to extend to you the gratitude and the greetings of the President of the United States. I told President Trump that I would be here. And I can assure you, as we can have been confronting this crisis of opioid abuse and addiction since early in this administration, and as we have been dealing as a nation with unspeakable acts of violence, most recently in Texas and in Ohio, that there is at least evidence , are driven by individuals with deep mental illness. This example in Indiana , of the state of Indiana making a commitment to expand facilities here , really represents a model for the nation. And the President and I have talked about it frequently. And, Bryan Mills, I want to commend you and Community Hospital for really partnering with the state of Indiana to make this a reality. I was , I was mentioning the fact that we've seen a 5 percent reduction in opioid overdoses nationwide. But if the statistics hold, Indiana is looking at roughly a 12 percent reduction in deaths from opioid overdoses. And that is a tribute to Governor Eric Holcomb, to this administration's commitment to combatting opioid abuse and addiction, to strong law enforcement efforts, but it's also a tribute to the healthcare community in this state. And so I want to extend to you our gratitude. It's amazing to think a reduction in overdoses , the number of lives that are saved in this state and around this country. And I just want to assure you that as we talk about expanding mental health services here in the state of Indiana, I'm going to be taking this back before the end of the day to meet with the President and share with him what Indiana has been able to do here and our determination to work with Congress in a bipartisan way to address the scourge of opioid abuse and addiction, to address the needs of mental health in this country, with national solutions. The President truly believes that, in the wake of mass shootings that not only beset Texas and Ohio, but in our tenure, Sutherland Springs, Texas, and Las Vegas, and other days that just broke the heart of the American people , we believe part of the answer is strong law enforcement; part of the answer is prevention. But we also believe , the President and I believe strongly that part of the answer is a renewed commitment to mental health in the United States. And I'm incredibly proud that Indiana is leading the way. And with the construction of this beautiful NeuroDiagnostic Institute , the first mental health hospital constructed in the state of Indiana in 50 years , I want to congratulate each of you on really providing a model for other states around the country and an inspiration to leaders in our nation's capital to do more in the area of mental health. So, thank you very much. And, Dr. Adams, thank you again for being here.",

         "Good afternoon. Last night, I spoke to the nation about the human toll of the pandemic and economic crises. I spoke about our two-step plan of rescue and recovery, and how we must deliver immediate economic relief to those who need it the most in this country. The millions of people who, through no fault of their own, are badly hurting. Millions who never thought they'd ever be out of work, facing eviction, or waiting hours in their car for a meal from a foodbank. I talked about how our rescue plan is a necessary bridge to our economic recovery and our ability to build back better, stronger, and more secure. And while the crises have cost real damage, I explained how it will cost more, hundreds of billions of dollars, to undo the harm. I talked about our moral obligation to act and about the clear economic consensus that making the investments I'm calling for that require deficit spending, are necessary to get us out of the deep hole we are in. I also talked about our seriousness of purpose. Our clear plan with transparency and accountability, and why our call for unity is equally necessary. Unity is not a pie-in-sky dream , it is a practical step to getting things done. We didn't get into all of this overnight, and we won't get out of it overnight, either. But we will get through it , together. And today, I'd like to talk more about what that means in sparing no effort to get America vaccinated. Vice President-elect Harris and I just received a briefing from our COVID team. Truthfully, we remain in a very dark winter. Infection rates are up 34%. More people are being hospitalized because of COVID than ever before. We're up to 3,000-4,000 deaths per day as we approach the grim milestone of 400,000 deaths in America. That's staggering. I know the pain so many of you are experiencing, staring at the empty chair around the kitchen table where a loved one used to sit, laugh, and love. I know the frustration we are all feeling. Almost a year later, we're still far from back to normal. The honest truth is this: things will get worse before they get better. And the policy changes we will be making will take time to show up in the COVID statistics, and they are not just statistics, but people's lives.. People getting infected today don't show up in case counts for weeks. Those who perish from the disease die weeks after exposure. So, it will take time, but I know there are things we can do. For example, the vaccines offer so much hope. We are grateful to the scientists and researchers, and everyone who participated in the clinical trials. We are grateful for the integrity of the process , the rigorous review and testing that's led to millions of people around the world already being vaccinated safely. But the vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure. And, in today's briefing, we discussed five things we will do to turn things around, five things to turn the frustration into motivation, five things to help us meet our goal of 100 million shots by the end of our first 100 days. Some wonder if we are reaching too far with that goal. Is it achievable? Let me be clear: I am convinced we can get it done. And this is the time to set big goals and to pursue them with courage and conviction because the health of the nation is at stake. First, we will immediately work with states to open up vaccinations to more priority groups. The process of establishing priority groups is driven by science, but the problem is the implementation has been too rigid and confusing. If you were to ask most people today, they couldn't tell you who exactly should be getting vaccinated. What they do know is there are tens of millions of doses of vaccines sitting unused in a freezer, while people who want and need the vaccine can't get it. We'll fix the problem by encouraging states to allow more people to get vaccinated beyond health care workers and move through these groups as quickly as states think they can. That includes anyone 65 and older , a population that has accounted for 80% of the deaths to date. We must also continue vaccinating frontline essential workers like educators, first responders, and grocery store workers. It won't mean that everyone in these groups will get vaccinated immediately, as supply is not where it needs to be. But it will mean that as vaccines become available, they will reach more people who need them. Second, if we're getting more people vaccinated, then we need more vaccination sites. That's why we will harness the full resources of the federal government to establish thousands of community vaccination centers. On my first day in office, I will instruct the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to begin setting up the first of these centers. By the end of our first month in office, we will have 100 federally-supported centers across the nation that will ultimately vaccinate millions of people. Think of places that are convenient and accessible. School gyms. Sports stadiums. Community centers. We've already had productive conversations with bipartisan groups of county officials, mayors, governors, tribal leaders, and leaders in the private sector who shared their ideas about this effort. And as we build them, we will make sure it's done equitably. We'll make sure there are vaccination centers in communities hit hardest by the pandemic, in Black and Latino communities, and rural communities as well. Within the first month of our administration, we will deploy mobile clinics. We will partner with community health centers, and local primary care doctors to offer vaccines to hard-to-reach communities in cities, small towns, and rural communities. And to staff the centers up, we will mobilize thousands of clinical and non-clinical professionals. Think of the people we deploy in natural disasters, experts at FEMA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, our Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, our military medical personnel, and our first responders. Additionally we will expand the pool of medical professionals, including retired healthcare workers, who can administer the vaccine and to ensure we have enough vaccinators to meet the nation's needs. And as governors of both parties have asked, our administration will reimburse states 100 percent when their National Guard is deployed in the fight against COVID-19. We will provide resources to help states cover the costs of personnel, vaccinators and administrative staff, as well as supplies like dry ice, laptops, and protective equipment. Third, we are going to fully activate pharmacies across the country to get the vaccines into more arms as quickly as possible. Millions of Americans turn to their local pharmacies every day for their medicines, flu shots, and much more. We will immediately start a new major effort working directly with both independent and chain pharmacies to get America vaccinated. This program will expand access in neighborhoods across the country so you can make an appointment and get your shot conveniently and quickly. Fourth, we will use the full strength of the federal government to ramp up supply of the vaccines. As I've said before, we will use the Defense Production Act to work with private industry to accelerate the making of materials needed to supply and administer the vaccine, from tubes and syringes to protective equipment. We've identified the suppliers and are prepared to work with their teams. As we made clear earlier this month, the Trump administration policy of holding back close to half of the supply did not make sense. My administration will release the vast majority of the vaccines when they are available, so more people can get vaccinated quickly, while still retaining a small reserve for any unforeseen shortages or delays. Let me be clear: we are not changing the FDA's recommended dosing schedule. We believe it is critical that everyone should get two doses within that FDA recommended timeframe. And fifth, we will always be honest and transparent about where we stand , both the good news and the bad. We will make sure that state and local officials know how much supply they are getting and when to expect it so they can plan. Right now, we are hearing that they can't plan because they don't know how much supply of vaccines they can expect and what time frame. That stops when we are in office. We also promise to provide regular updates to you, the American people, on our progress and our goals. We will be transparent about the decisions we are making and why. Our administration will lead with science and scientists with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health that are free from political influence, a Surgeon General who is independent and speaks directly to the people, and an FDA whose decisions are based on science and science alone. While millions of Americans have already gotten the vaccine and millions more are ready to get it, we also know that we need to address vaccine hesitancy and build trust in many communities. We know that's the case, for example, in Black, Latino, and Native American communities, people who have not always been treated with the dignity and honesty they deserve by the federal government and the scientific community throughout our history. We also see that disinformation campaigns are already underway to further undermine trust in the vaccine. Our administration will launch a massive public education campaign to rebuild that trust. We'll help people understand what science tells us: that the vaccines help reduce the risk of COVID infections, and can better safeguard our health and the health of our families and communities. It's a critical piece to account for the tragic reality of the disproportional impact this virus has had on Black, Latino, and Native Americans, people who are being infected at about four timesthe rate of white Americans, and dying at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. This is unacceptable and unconscionable. Equity is central to our COVID response. And the vice president-elect and I commit to making sure communities of color, our rural neighbors, those living with disabilities, and seniors are not left behind in our vaccination plans. Our plan is as clear as it is bold: Get more people vaccinated for free. Create more places for them to get vaccinated. Mobilize more medical teams to get shots into peoples' arms. Increase supply and get it out the door as soon as possible. This will be one of the most challenging operational efforts ever undertaken by our country. You have my word that we will manage the hell out of this operation. But as I said last night, we need funding from Congress to make this happen. And I'm optimistic. I'm convinced the American people are ready to spare no effort and no expense to get this done. All of these steps will take some time. It will take many months to get where we need to be. There will be stumbles. And, yes, I know so much has already been asked of you. And, when we are sworn-in next week, we're going to ask you to keep the faith and keep following what we know works. One of our 100-day challenges is to mask up for the first 100 days. I will be issuing executive orders to require masks for federal workers, on federal property, and on interstate travel, like trains and planes. We will also be working with mayors and Governors in red states and blue states to require masks in cities and states. I know masks have become a partisan issue. But it's a patriotic act. The experts say that by wearing a mask from now until April, we will save more than 50,000 lives. Quite frankly, it was shocking to see members of Congress, while the Capitol was under siegeby a deadly mob of thugs, refuse to wear a mask while they were in a secure location. I'm so proud of my Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester who was trying to get everyone to mask up. But look what happened when they didn't. At least four members of Congress to date, including a cancer survivor, now have COVID-19. For God's sake, wear a mask for yourself, for your loved ones, for your country. These are life and death matters. We need you to stick with the hand washing, social distancing, and avoid indoor gatherings with people outside your household. We'll be a partner to the states and cities, so where things are working, we'll help do more of the good work, and where things can improve, we'll bring more resources to bear to get folks tested and vaccinated. We will work closely with nonprofits and the private sector who we know all want to partner with us in this effort. The more people we vaccinate and the faster we do it, the sooner we can put this pandemic behind us. And the sooner we can build our economy back better, and get back to our lives and loved ones. As we've seen during this pandemic, we can't solve our problems as a divided nation. The only way we come through this is together as fellow Americans and as the United States of America. Vice-President-elect Harris and I ran on that vision. And starting noon on Wednesday, that is exactly how we are going to govern and ask for your help. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops.",

         "As long as I am President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. Good morning. I'm pleased to inform you: The American people should be extremely grateful and happy no Americans were harmed in last night's attack by the Iranian regime. We suffered no casualties, all of our soldiers are safe, and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases. Our great American forces are prepared for anything. Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world. No American or Iraqi lives were lost because of the precautions taken, the dispersal of forces, and an early warning system that worked very well. I salute the incredible skill and courage of America's men and women in uniform. For far too long , all the way back to 1979, to be exact , nations have tolerated Iran's destructive and destabilizing behavior in the Middle East and beyond. Those days are over. Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world. We will never let that happen. Last week, we took decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threatening American lives. At my direction, the United States military eliminated the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. As the head of the Quds Force, Soleimani was personally responsible for some of the absolutely worst atrocities. He trained terrorist armies, including Hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian targets. He fueled bloody civil wars all across the region. He viciously wounded and murdered thousands of U.S. troops, including the planting of roadside bombs that maim and dismember their victims. Soleimani directed the recent attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq that badly wounded four service members and killed one American, and he orchestrated the violent assault on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. In recent days, he was planning new attacks on American targets, but we stopped him. Soleimani's hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood. He should have been terminated long ago. By removing Soleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists: If you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people. As we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime. These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior. In recent months alone, Iran has seized ships in international waters, fired an unprovoked strike on Saudi Arabia, and shot down two U.S. drones. Iran's hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash. Instead of saying 'thank you' to the United States, they chanted 'death to America.' In fact, they chanted 'death to America' the day the agreement was signed. Then, Iran went on a terror spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration. The regime also greatly tightened the reins on their own country, even recently killing 1,500 people at the many protests that are taking place all throughout Iran. The very defective JCPOA expires shortly anyway, and gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout. Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism. The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China to recognize this reality. They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal , or JCPOA , and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place. We must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper, and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential. Iran can be a great country. Peace and stability cannot prevail in the Middle East as long as Iran continues to foment violence, unrest, hatred, and war. The civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime: Your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer. It will not be allowed to go forward. Today, I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process. Over the last three years, under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before and America has achieved energy independence. These historic accompliments changed our strategic priorities. These are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible. And options in the Middle East became available. We are now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil. The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration, at a cost of $2.5 trillion. U.S. Armed Forces are stronger than ever before. Our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal, and fast. Under construction are many hypersonic missiles. The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it. American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent. Three months ago, after destroying 100 percent of ISIS and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims, and all who stood in his way. He was a monster. Al-Baghdadi was trying again to rebuild the ISIS caliphate, and failed. Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters have been killed or captured during my administration. ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran. The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran, and we should work together on this and other shared priorities. Finally, to the people and leaders of Iran: We want you to have a future and a great future , one that you deserve, one of prosperity at home, and harmony with the nations of the world. The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it. I want to thank you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.",

(Applause.) And before I begin, would you join me in showing your appreciation , I couldn't be more proud of her , my wife of 33 years, a Marine Corps mom, but someone who you just heard is dedicating her time and her energy to supporting military families and spouses. Join me in thanking the Second Lady of the United States of America for her presence and her inspiring words. (Applause.) Mr. President, it's an honor to be here in Poland, a bastion of freedom in Central Europe, to address the Armed Forces of the United States and the men and women of the 33rd Air Base in Powidz. And to the men and women of the Polish Armed Forces who are here today, from the bottom of my heart, on behalf of the American people and on behalf of all the men and women in the uniform of the United States who stand shoulder to shoulder with you, thank you for standing strong in the defense of freedom. (Applause.) I couldn't be more proud of all of the Americans who are serving here. Nearly 5,000 strong deployed here across Poland as a part of our strong and unbreakable alliance through NATO. But I must say, I take particular pleasure, Mr. President, in the fact that there are a number of service members here from my home state of Indiana, my fellow Hoosiers. (Applause.) Deployed six months ago, the men and women of the 252nd Support Maintenance Company of the Indiana National Guard , I'll tell you, the home state is proud of you and so am I. Thank you for your service. (Applause.) And to all my fellow Americans who are here, to all of our friends across Poland, let me bring greetings from a great admirer of Poland and the Polish people, a great admirer and friend to your President. I bring greetings from the leader of the free world and the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The President asked me to be here in Poland simply to say thank you. First and foremost, thank you to all of you for stepping up to serve, for standing united to defend our freedom and our collective security. You come from the rest of us, but you are the best of us. You are heroes all. And as the Second Lady just said, we're especially grateful to your families back home. They serve as well, and I hope before the day is out, you'll send them word that they have our thanks and our admiration as well. I'm happy to report to my fellow Americans here that, since the first day of this administration, President Trump has been taking decisive action to strengthen the Armed Forces of the United States, to rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy. And we have made the strongest fighting force in the history of the world stronger still. (Applause.) Just in the past two years, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the final days of the Cold War. And if you didn't notice, we gave our troops the biggest pay raise that you received in nearly 10 years. We released a national security strategy advancing peace across the wider world, as well , peace through American strength, and the strength of strong alliances with freedom- loving nations around the world. We initiated the modernization of our nuclear arsenal. And just last month, President Trump unveiled our nation's new strategy for missile defense. But I'm here in Poland, and before the week is out, I'll travel to Munich in the coming days to bring a message, on behalf of our President, to the people of Poland, and to freedom-loving people everywhere. And it's simply this: We are with you, we will stand with you, and the United States of America stands with Poland as a part of the most successful mutual defense alliance in the history of the world, and we always will. (Applause.) Under President Trump, the United States will always put the security and prosperity of America first. But as the President has made clear, and as all of you demonstrate each and every day, America first does not mean America alone. And the United States will always stand with the people of Poland , just, frankly, as we've done through the long and storied history of friendship that ties together our two nations together. It's remarkable to think our ancestors fought side by side in my nation's War for Independence more than two centuries ago. To this day, the American people honor the sacrifice of Polish heroes who shed blood alongside American patriots in the cause of our freedom, men like Tadeusz Ko�ciuszko and Casimir Pu�aski.Last year marked the 100th anniversary of the rebirth of freedom here in Poland at the end of the First World War. And this year, we celebrate 100 years of restored diplomatic ties between Poland and the United States of America. It is a century of bond and an unbreakable friendship. (Applause.) Thirty years ago, the Polish people cast off their Soviet oppressors and once again reclaimed your liberty. Just 20 years ago, joined the United States and our allies in that historic transatlantic alliance , the NATO Alliance forged to ensure our common defense. And nearly two years ago, President Trump stood in the heart of Warsaw , in Krasi�ski Square , and declared to the people of Poland and all of the world that the United States will continue to stand, in his word, and defend 'the priceless ties that bind us together as nations, as allies, and as a civilization.' We will always stand with the Polish people for liberty, democracy, the rule of law, and the respect for the dignity of every human life. (Applause.) In so many ways, the world is even a more dangerous place today than it was since the fall of Communism a quarter-century ago. And to confront the threats that we face today, the people of Poland know, and the people of the United States know, that the free world needs the members of NATO to be strong and united. And so we are. We stand together in defense of our alliance and all that we hold dear. And each member nation, we know, has a vital role to play. At the heart of our NATO Alliance is a solemn promise that an attack on one is an attack on all. But to keep this oath requires preparation, it requires investment. And for every NATO member to uphold their commitment to our common defense, we need to work together. And because of your history, the people of Poland understand this all too well , which is why even in our first year in office, Poland was one of only four other NATO members that fulfilled their promise to spend 2 percent of your gross domestic product toward our mutual defense. And, Mr. President, you have our admiration and our thanks. (Applause.) We thank you for your leadership. We thank you for your efforts and your nation's commitment to increase military spending, to provide for our common defense, and to advance the common interest of freedom in our alliance. You know, the United States has long supported this vital alliance. It's a cornerstone of our common defense. And as President Trump said here nearly two years ago, we are once again demonstrating our commitment, as he said, 'not merely with words, but with actions.' Around the world, the United States is once again standing with our allies and standing up to our enemies. And there's no better proof than the steps we've taken to strengthen our relationship with the nation of Poland. Last September, President Trump and President Duda signed the Joint Declaration on Strategic Partnership to reaffirm our nations' ironclad commitment to our historic alliance. And, in just a few moments, Poland is taking its place among the most capable and formidable nations in the world when we officially acknowledge an agreement by Poland to purchase a battalion's worth of High Mobility Artillery Rocket System launchers from the United States of America. And, Mr. President, we are pleased to partner with you in Poland's national defense. (Applause.) Mr. President, because of your leadership, this new long-range, precision-fire system will provide a critical new capability to the Polish military. It'll strengthen also the cooperation between our new nations , two nations, and it'll help protect Central and Eastern Europe from air and missile attacks for decades to come. And we are grateful for your vision and your leadership in securing these resources. You know, no matter what threats the future may hold, all of you gathered here today , the Armed Forces of Poland and the Armed Forces of the United States , can be confident of this: The United States will never waver in our commitment to our common defense. (Applause.) We will be strong in arms, strong in resolve, and most of all, strong in our conviction that, as President Trump said nearly two years ago, and I quote, 'The West will never, ever be broken. Our values will prevail, our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph.' (Applause.) This is our cause. It's why NATO exists. It's why the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Poland and the Polish people , today and every day. And standing here today, looking out at all of you, I say with confidence: Our combined military power is unmatched. Our strength-of-arms is unsurpassed. And I know our forces are ready to respond anytime, anywhere. And so today, to my fellow Americans serving here in Poland, I urge you, on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief: Be vigilant. Do your duty. Mind your mission. And look after one another, even as you play a role in this vital alliance. And know that the American people and, I'm confident, the people of Poland are grateful to each and every one of you, and know they can count on each one of you every day. As I look out across this hangar, I see men and women in uniform, American and Polish. All of you have answered the call to put on the uniform, to count others' lives more important than your own, and to protect your families and ours, and to preserve freedom. Your burden is heavy, full of uncertainty, for as the Bible says, and we know, the 'soldier does not bear the sword in vain.' And so we know you are prepared. We do not know what challenges lie ahead, but we will be prepared. And I know I speak on behalf of my President and yours when I say that we have confidence that you will confront and overcome whatever tests and trials may arise, just as those who came before you did in their day. Because today, as in ages past, your commitment and ours is unwavering. Our courage is undiminished. And our spirit, in common cause for freedom, is unbreakable. So in the name of the heroes who came before, with confidence in all of you, and with faith in God, I know that, by your service and through this alliance, we will protect our people. We will defend our freedom. And together, we will forge a future of security, prosperity, and peace for Poland, the United States, and freedom-loving nations across the world for generations to come. So thank you for your service. God bless you. God bless Poland. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)",

         "GOOD AFTERNOON. TODAY WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS AND DONALD TRUMP WILL FILE IN THE SUPREME COURT TO STRIP AWAY HEALTHCARE COVERAGE FROM TENS OF MILLIONS OF FAMILIES IN THE UNITED STATES. IN 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS IF HE SUCCEEDS MORE THAN 23 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE COVERAGE OVERNIGHT INCLUDING 1 MILLION IN PENNSYLVANIA. INSURANCE ONCE AGAIN DISCRIMINATE SERVICES ARE DROP COVERAGE FOR PEOPLE LIKE DIABETES OR CANCER OR ASTHMA MOST CRUELLY OF ALL DONALD TRUMP IF HE HAS HIS WAY THOSE WHO HAVE COMPLICATIONS FROM COVE IN 18 IS THE NEW PRE-EXISTING CONDITION LIKE LONG SCARS OR HEART DAMAGE AND IF DONALD TRUMP PREVAILS IN COURT AND TO STRIP AWAY COVERAGE JACK UP PREMIUM SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY SURVIVED FIGHTING CORONAVIRUS THOSE HAVING STRUGGLED WINNING THE FIGHT OF THEIR LIVES WOULD HAVE THEIR PIECE OF MINE STOLE AND AT THE MOMENT THEY NEEDED IT THE MOST THEY WOULD LIVE THEIR LIVES, AND ADVICE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP'S LEGACY AND FAILURE TO PREVENT ON - - PROTECT AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THE CORONAVIRUS AND THIS CRUSADE TO TAKE HEALTHCARE PROTECTIONS AWAY FROM AMERICAN FAMILIES. I HAVE CALLED ON DONALD TRUMP MANY TIMES TO WITHDRAW HIS LAWSUIT IN TODAY I AM RENEWING THAT CALL. DROPPED THE LAWSUIT. STOPPED TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. STOP TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S HEALTHCARE AND PEACE OF MIND. NOW MORE THAN EVER STOP TRYING TO STEAL THEIR PIECE OF MIND I CANNOT COMPREHEND THE CRUELTY TO INFLICT THOSE PEOPLE HE IS SUPPOSED TO SERVE. ONE OF THE FAMILIES OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHO LIVE NOT FAR FROM HERE IN MANNHEIM PENNSYLVANIA JUST FOUR YEARS OLD WHEN THEIR MOM STACY HEARD THE MOST DEVASTATING WORDS A PARENT CAN HERE. THOSE OF THE TWINS WERE DIAGNOSED WITH LEUKEMIA. I PROMISE STOPS YOUR HEART. AND KNOX THE ENTIRE WORLD OFFICE ACCESS ON - - AXIS IN THE VERY LAST THING ON YOUR MIND THE VERY LAST THING ON YOUR MIND THAT SHOULD BE ON YOUR MIND IF YOU CAN AFFORD TREATMENT FOR YOUR CHILDREN. WHEN STACY'S TWINS GOT SICK THERE WAS NO AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AFTER STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS AND THE WAVES OF HOPE AND FEAR AND AFTER ENDURING MORE THAN ANY AND PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO ENDURE SHE STILL FACED A FUTURE WHERE THE TWINS COULD BE DENIED COVERAGE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS CREATED TO PUT A STOP TO THAT TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE STACY TO FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS AND SAVE THEIR CHILDREN THEY WON THE FIGHT THEY BE CANCER NOW THEY ARE 22 YEARS OF AGE STUDYING EDUCATION AND THEN GRADUATING FROM ARCADIA UNIVERSITY AND BECAUSE OF THE ACA INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN NO LONGER DENIED COVERAGE BECAUSE THEY ARE SURVIVORS OF CANCER. I AM PROUD OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IN ADDITION TO HELPING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THIS IS A LAW VITAL COVERAGE FOR 25 MILLION AMERICANS THAT BARS INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM TAPPING AMERICAN BENEFITS AND CHARGING WOMEN MORE FOR INSURANCE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMAN FOR NEARLY 12 MILLION SENIORS. TO SEE THE COST SPIKE BECAUSE OF THE MEDICARE DON'T HOLD WOULD SUDDENLY REOPEN AND THE COST HAS GONE PRECIPITOUSLY THIS SAVES LIVES BUT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN MODERN HISTORY SINCE THE PANDEMIC OF 1918, DONALD TRUMP IS SUING TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE. IT'S CRUEL, HEARTLESS, CALLOUS BECAUSE HE CANNOT ABIDE THE THOUGHT LETTING ONE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE HAVE SEEN THAT SAME CALLOUSNESS OF THE CORONAVIRUS JUST OVER THREE MONTHS AGO AS MOST AMERICANS WERE FIRST COMING TO GRIPS WITH THE UNPRECEDENTED SCALE OF DANGER AND PANDEMIC PRESIDENT TRUMP PUBLICLY CLAIMED 'ANYBODY THAT ONCE A TEST ANYBODY CAN GET IT. THAT SIMPLY WAS NOT TRUE AND HE KNEW IT AND THEN FIVE DAYS AGO AT THE CAMPAIGN RALLY AND ALSO OKLAHOMA HE ADMITTED TELLING PEOPLE SLOW THE TESTING DOWN PLEASE. HIS ONE HOUR 50 MINUTES SPEECH. SLOWED THE TESTING DOWN, PLEASE. THE FIRST THE SPOKESPEOPLE TRIED TO SAY HE WAS JOKING BUT THEN HE SAID HE WASN'T. HE CALLED IT 'A DOUBLE EDGE SWORD. THAT IS THE QUOTE. LET'S BE CRYSTAL CLEAR WHAT HE MEANS BY THAT. QUESTING UNEQUIVOCABLY SAVES LIVES WIDESPREAD TESTING IS THE KEY TO BUILD OUR ECONOMY AGAIN. THE OTHER EDGE THAT THEY THINK THAT FINDING OUT MORE AMERICANS ARE SICK WILL MAKE HIM LOOK BAD. THAT'S WHAT HE'S WORRIED ABOUT. HE'S WORRIED ABOUT LOOKING BAD DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO STOP WORRYING ABOUT HOW HE LOOKS AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE REST OF AMERICA INCREASING IN 29 STATES DEALING WITH THIS FOR A LONG TIME TRUMP CANNOT WISH IT AWAY HE CANNOT SPEND THAT TO MEET HIS POLITICAL WISHES THERE ARE NO MIRACLES COMING WE WILL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR THIS BECAUSE NONE IS COMING WE HAVE TO STEP UP AS AMERICANS ALL OF US AND DO THE SIMPLE THINGS IN THE HARD THINGS TO KEEP OUR FAMILIES SAFE TO REOPEN THE ECONOMY AND EVENTUALLY PUT THE PANDEMIC BEHIND US AND DO THIS WITHOUT RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S UP TO ALL OF US. WE HAVE TO WEAR MASKS MINUS OFF BECAUSE SOCIALLY DISTANT STAND IN FRONT OF A MICROPHONE I WEAR IT EVERYWHERE I GO. AND I KNOW AS AMERICANS IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE ARE USED TO BUT IT MATTERS ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT TELLS US IT COULD BE THE SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE THING WE CAN DO WE HAVE TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE LIKE WE ARE HERE TODAY IT SEEMS SO STRANGE TO US NOT AS AMERICANS BUT HUMAN BEINGS. WE ARE TAUGHT TO GATHER IT HARD AGAIN LAUGH WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT FOR NOW WE HAVE TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE IT MATTERS. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP OUR ECONOMY RUNNING TO BRING A NUMBER OF CASES DOWN. THE PRESIDENT WANTS US TO BELIEVE THERE IS A CHOICE BETWEEN THE ECONOMY OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AMAZINGLY HE STILL HAS NOT GRASPED THE MOST BASIC FACT OF THE CRISIS TO FIX THE ECONOMY WE HAVE TO GET CONTROL OVER THE VIRUS. SAY IT AGAIN. TO FIX THE ECONOMY WE HAVE TO GET CONTROL OVER THE VIRUS. LIKE A CHILD HE CANNOT BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENED TO HIM. ALL OF HIS WHINING AND SELF-PITY SELF-PITY, THIS PANDEMIC DID NOT HAPPEN TO HIM. WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF US HIS JOB ISN'T TO WHINE ABOUT IT BUT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND TO LEAD. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO HER ON - - EASE THE BURDEN AND PUT YOUR FAMILY FIRST THAT WOULD BEGIN WITH A DRAMATIC EXPANSION OF HEALTH COVERAGE WITH BOLD STEPS TO LOWER HEALTH CARE COST WE NEED A PUBLIC OPTION NOW MORE THAN EVER ESPECIALLY WHEN MORE THAN 20 MILLION PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED THAT ALLOWS EVERY AMERICAN REGARDLESS OF EMPLOYMENT STATUS THE CHOICE TO GET A MEDICARE -LIKE PLAN TO FORCE PRIVATE INSURERS TO KEEP PAYMENTS LOW OFFER BETTER COVERAGE BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME HAVE TO COMPETE FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE A PROFIT WE WILL LOWER PREMIUMS FOR PEOPLE BUYING COVERAGE ON THE ROUND KNOW AMERICAN HAS TO SPEND MORE THAN EIGHT.5 PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON HEALTH INSURANCE. ALL THE DETAILS ARE LAID OUT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WE WILL ALSO FURTHER REDUCE COST TO MAKE IT LESS EXPENSIVE TO HAVE LOWER DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES IN THE PRACTICE OF SO-CALLED SURPRISE BILLING LEAVING WITH UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH BILLS AFTER YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE MY PLAN LOWERS HEALTHCARE COST JUST AS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE QUICKLY WHEN IT IS NEEDED NOW. ENDURING ILLNESS AND RISKY CHOICES LOSING THE EMPLOYER'S PLAN AS THE EMPLOYER'S GO OUT OF BUSINESS. AND NEED LIFELINES NOW. THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES DESERVE. THEY DON'T NEED A PRESIDENT TO GO INTO COURT TO DENY THEM THE HEALTHCARE THEY HAD. AND ALSO YOU NEED A PRESIDENT THAT WILL FIGHT LIKE HELL TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THE HEALTHCARE THEY NEED. I LOOK FORWARD TO ENDING IT FOR HIM AND WORK QUICKLY WITH CONGRESS TO ME BUT PROTECTIONS OF LOWER HEALTHCARE COST AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. THIS IS MY PROMISE I'M PRESIDENT I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THE SAME WAY I WILL MY OWN. THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME AND MY WIFE JILL. I WAS SWORN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, NEXT TO A HOSPITAL BED MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE JUST KILLED IN A CAR CRASH LYING IN THAT BED WITH MY TWO YOUNG BOYS BOYS, SURVIVING BOYS. I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE HEALTHCARE, HEALTHCARE WE NEEDED IMMEDIATELY. FOUR YEARS LATER, 40 YEARS LATER MY GROWN SON AFTER THE IT ATTORNEY GENERAL COMING BACK AND THEN CONTRACTED FATAL CANCER. AND THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG HE WOULD HAVE TO LIVE, HOW MANY MONTHS. SITTING IN THE HOSPITAL JILL AND HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN FOR HIS HANDS. AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD WHAT IN THE HELL WOULD I DO IF THE INSURANCE COMPANY COULD DO BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE ACT TO SAY YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF TIME YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF YOUR COVERAGE EXCEPT FOR THOSE LESS PAINFUL MONTHS DYING ON YOUR OWN OWN. AND SUFFER IN PEACE I CANNOT FATHOM. I CANNOT FATHOM HAVING TO GO THROUGH THAT. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO MANY FAMILIES BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. SO AMY, I UNDERSTAND WHEN I SAY I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THE SAME WAY TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY. NOTHING AND TAKE MORE SERIOUSLY THAT IS MY PROMISE TO STACY AND VICTORIA AND AMY AND OTHER AMERICANS THAT IS WHAT THE PRESIDENCY IS. IT IS A DUTY TO CARE. A DUTY TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. , ALL OF US. NO TRUST IS MORE SACRED NO PURPOSE MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAN A PRESIDENT TO DO ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THEY CAN DO TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES. I WANT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN TO NOW IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING OR WORRIED ABOUT HOW YOU GET TO THE DAY, I WILL NOT ABANDON YOU I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU TO FACE THESE CHALLENGES ALONE AND WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. WE WILL BUILD A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE'LL BUILD ON IT AND BUILD THE ECONOMY AND THE COUNTRY BACK TO BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE THEY GOT OFF CRISIS. THAT I PROMISE YOU. LET ME AND BY THINKING THE FAMILIES THERE ARE SO MANY LIKE YOURS ACROSS AMERICA. I GET IT. THERE IS REAL SOLIDARITY. WE WILL GET THIS DONE I PROMISE. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.

         "GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I WANT TO SAY A SPECIAL HI TO MY GOOD FRIEND SECRETARY DAILY. IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME. GLAD TO SEE YOU LOOKING SO WELL. I'M HONORED TO BE WITH YOU ALL TODAY AND I WANT TO START BY THANKING ARTURO FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY VISION FOR LATINOS IN OUR COUNTRY. IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPENING REMARKS. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY. NONE MORE STARK THAN THE LAST 3.5 YEARS. DONALD TRUMP HIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE PURSUED AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT ON LATINO COMMUNITIES, FROM THE MOMENT HE CAME DOWN THAT GOLDEN ESCALATOR SAYING HE WAS GOING TO TAKE ON THE MEXICAN RAPISTS. IT STARTED THE MOMENT HE ANNOUNCED HIS PRESIDENCY. FEEDING THE FLAMES OF FEARS AND RACISM AGAINST LATINOS. IT IS BAKED INTO EVERY ASPECT OF HOW HE HAS GOVERNED. THIS WEEK WAS AN ESPECIALLY POIGNANT REMINDER OF THE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF ALLOWING THAT KIND OF HATE TO GROW UNCHECKED. I THOUGHT WE COULD DEFEAT A, BUT IT ONLY HIDES UNDER THE ROCKS. WHEN A PRESIDENT BREATHES OXYGEN IN, IT COMES ROARING OUT. ON MONDAY, WE MARKED THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGIC MASS SHOOTING IN EL PASO WHERE A GUNMAN EXPLICITLY SOUGHT TO TARGET LATINOS AND 23 BEAUTIFUL LIVES WERE STOLEN FROM US AND THEIR FAMILIES. I KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO LOSE A CHILD. IT IS AWFUL. IT IS STARKLY , THE STAKES OF TRUMP'S IRRESPONSIBLE POLICIES, OF DIVISION AND HATE THAT HE PROMOTES ISRAEL. , IS REAL. THESE ARE LIFE-AND-DEATH DECISIONS. WHETHER IT IS REPEATED ATTACKS ON DREAMERS OR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. WHETHER IT IS HIS NEGLECT OF PEOPLE AFTER HURRICANE MARIA AND PUERTO RICO FOR HIS REPEATED FAILURE TO MAKE SURE ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAVE THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED, DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED THE LATINO COMMUNITY TIME AND TIME AGAIN. SO, THE QUESTION YOU ASKED, ARTURO, HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE REAL A BETTER LIFE FOR LATINOS? THAT IS THE KEY QUESTION. THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY LITERALLY DEFENDS ON HOW WE ANSWER IT. THAT IS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. HERE IS THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH. THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE LATINOS HAVE THE ABILITY AND TOOLS TO SUCCEED. LATINOS ARE THE FASTEST GROWING POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES. ALREADY ONE QUARTER OF OUR SCHOOLCHILDREN, ONE QUARTER ARE LATINO. HOW IN GOD'S NAME CAN WE HAVE A STRONG AND THRIVING REPUBLIC IF WE DON'T FULLY DEAL LATINOS INTO EVERY ASPECT OF AMERICAN LIFE. THESE KIDS ARE NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S KIDS. THE KITE STRINGS THAT LIFT OUR NATIONAL AMBITION. THAT IS WHY EARLIER THIS WEEK I RELEASED MY LATINO AGENDA. THINGS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON ALL ALONG AND YOU KNOW ABOUT, BUT I PUT THEM ALL IN ONE PLACE. IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR NOT JUST HOW WE ARE GOING TO UNDO ALL THE HARM THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS INFLICTED, BUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE LATINOS ARE INCLUDED IN OUR PLANS TO BUILD THAT MEANS INVESTING IN LATINO ECONOMIC MOBILITY, BECAUSE THAT IS THE BASIS OF IT ALL, ECONOMIC MOBILITY. EVERYTHING MAKING SURE LATINO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CAN ACCESS CAPITAL TO MAKING IT EASIER FOR LATINO FAMILIES TO BUY A HOME, TO BUILD INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH. HOW DID EVERY OTHER MIDDLE-CLASS PERSON DO IT? THEY WERE ABLE TO BUY A HOME AND BUILD EQUITY IN A HOME AND PASS IT ON FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. ONE OF THE FOUR PLANKS OF MY BILL BACK BETTER PLAN IS ABOUT ADDRESSING RACIAL INEQUITIES. IT IS ABOUT BREAKING THE CYCLE WE ARE IN GOOD TIMES LATINO COMMUNITIES STILL LAG BEHIND AN EVENT TIMES , IN A RECOVERY, THEY TAKE THE LONGEST TO BOUNCE BACK TO WHERE THEY WORK, WHICH WAS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN WITH. WE WILL USE EVERY TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL TO TAKE ON INEQUITIES. IT ALSO WORKS ON ENDING RACE-BASED HEALTH DISPARITIES. TINO'S ARE AMONG THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WITH MILLIONS GETTING INSURANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME. NOW THE INSURANCE RATE DROPPED FROM 32% TO 19%. THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT WIN FOR THE LATINO COMMUNITY. IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC, WITH ALMOST 160,000 DEAD, THOSE FAMILIES LOST, PART OF THEIR SOUL, PART OF THEIR HEART. NOW TRUMP IS TRYING TO STRIP PEOPLE OF THEIR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN COURT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. LATINOS ARE BURYING SOME OF THE HEAVIEST BURDENS. DUE TO HIGH RATES OF INFECTION BECAUSE LATINOS DISPROPORTIONATELY SERVE IN CAREGIVING ROLES AND INCREASE THE RISK OF EXPOSURE AND SAVE OTHER PEOPLE. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE. I AM GOING TO PROTECT OBAMA CARE AND BUILD ON IT WITH A PUBLIC OPTION SO EVERY SINGLE PERSON CAN HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY AFFORDABLE CAL , HEALTH CARE. WHEN IT COMES TO FIGHTING THIS PANDEMIC, WE HAVE TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR. EVERYONE GETS FREE ACCESS TO TESTING AND TREATMENT. WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE, A VACCINE. EVERYONE GETS IT. WE HAVE TO FIGHT THIS VIRUS WITHOUT REGARD TO IMMIGRANT STATUS. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE WILL BEAT THIS THING. IT IS THE ONLY HUMANE THING TO DO. WE WILL ALSO EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION AND TAKE ON THE RACIAL INEQUITIES IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. THAT STARTS EARLY TO MAKE SURE HIGH-QUALITY PRE-K IS AVAILABLE TO EVERY CHILD THREE AND FOUR YEARS OLD. STUDIES SHOW THAT IT INCREASES EXPONENTIALLY THE PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS FOR THE ENTIRE 12 YEARS. IT GOES THROUGH MAKING POST HIGH SCHOOL AFFORDABLE , POST HIGH SCHOOL IS AFFORDABLE FOR STUDENTS. PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE TUITION FREE FOR MAKING LESS THAN $10025,000 REWARD. DOUBLING PELL GRANTS, INCREASING FUNDING FOR HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTIONS. I STARTED TODAY BY SPEAKING ABOUT THE TRAGEDY IN EL PASO ONE YEAR AGO. WE ALSO NOTE LATINOS SUFFER EVERY DAY FROM HATE CRIMES AND GOOD VIOLENCE. IT DOES NOT ALWAYS MAKE NATIONAL HEADLINES. UNDER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL GET WEAPONS OF WAR AND HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I WILL TAKE THE FIGHT DIRECTLY TO THE NRA AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSE , AND HOLD GUN MANUFACTURERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSE TO LATINO FAMILIES. TRUMP FAILS TO UNDERSTAND THE BASIC TRUTH OF IMMIGRANTS, THAT THEY ARE AN INCREDIBLE SOURCE OF OUR NATION'S STRENGTH AND THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN, ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1860'S WHEN MY ANCESTORS JUMPED ONTO THE SEA, NOT KNOWING WHERE THEY WERE GOING, NOT KNOWING WHETHER THEY WOULD MAKE IT A SHORT, ALL THE WAY TODAY , WAY TO TODAY. WE ARE ABLE TO SHARE THE BEST OF EVERY CULTURE. IT TAKES COURAGE TO LEAD A COUNTRY OF EVERY KIND, OF EVERY BACKGROUND. THAT IS WHY WE ARE WHO WE ARE. UNLIKE THE PRESIDENT, WE WILL IMMEDIATELY AND TRUMPS ASSAULT ON THE DIGNITY OF AMERICA , TRUMP'S ASSAULT ON THE DIGNITY OF AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. OUR COUNTRY IS A SAFE PLACE FOR ASYLUM-SEEKERS, THOSE FLEEING PERSECUTION. WE HAVE NEVER MADE ASYLUM-SEEKERS SEEK ASYLUM OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE WILL STOP THE UNION MADE PRACTICE , INHUMANE PRACTICE OF SEPARATING FAMILIES FROM THEIR CHILDREN. WE WILL STOP , AND DID BEST CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO HELP ENSURE MIGRANTS GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED WHILE THEY ARE NAVIGATING THE ASYLUM PROCESS. IT WILL COST A LOT OF MONEY, BUT IT IS A HELL OF A LOT CHEAPER THAN BUILDING A WALL. WE WILL RESTORE SENSIBLE ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES AND STOP TERRORIZING LATINO COMMUNITIES. THE IDEA YOU WAIT OUTSIDE AT 10:00 MASS TO GRAB SOMEONE FROM A CHURCH, THE ANXIETY FROM CHILDREN. THE ANXIETY IS OVERWHELMING. IT WILL HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT UPON THE GENERATION. WE WILL PROTECT DREAMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND EVERY SINGLE AGREEMENT THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SIGNED 2 , LAW IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS. IMMIGRATION FOR , REFORM WILL FOCUS ON KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER. INCLUDING PROVIDING A CLEAR ROADMAP FOR 11 MILLION , FOR CITIZENSHIP FOR 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. I KNOW THAT IS A PRETTY BIG AGENDA. THIS IS THE MOMENT TO GET IT DONE. THE PANDEMIC AS LIFTED BLINDERS OFF SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ON WHO IS REALLY ESSENTIAL TO OUR ECONOMIC STRATEGY. IT IS NOT WALL STREET BANKERS OR CEOS, IT IS THE MIDDLE CLASS, HARD-WORKING UNION MEMBERS COMMITTED TO THE RIGHTS OF ALL WORKERS, FOLKS AND LATINO COMMUNITIES WHO ARE BUSTING THEIR NECKS EVERY DAY TO KEEP THE COUNTRY RUNNING. AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE WE ARE READY TO CLOSE THE RISK AT , THE RESPECT CAP, THE OPPORTUNITY GAP. SOME OF THOSE LATINO WORKERS HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FOR SO LONG. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, WHEN HE LOST A JOB UP IN SCRANTON. MY DAD NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE. HE IS TO SAY, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, HONOR. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK A KID IN THE EYE AND SAY IT IS GOING TO BE OK. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. DIGNITY, HONOR, TREATING PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY. WE CAN BUILD A NEW ADMINISTRATION THAT RESPECTS THE FULL DIVERSITY OF OUR NATION AND THE FULL DIVERSITY OF LATINO COMMUNITIES. WHEN I MEAN FULL DIVERSITY, UNLIKE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES AND THE COMMUNITIES, BUT FROM EVER. FROM EUROPE TO SOUTH AMERICA ALL THE WAY TO OUR BORDER WITH MEXICO AND THE CARIBBEAN. AND DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS, DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES, BUT ALL LATINOS. WE WILL GET A CHANCE TO DO THAT WHEN WE WIN IN NOVEMBER. THE REASON WE NEED EVERYONE TO GET OUT AND ABOUT, I CANNOT DO THIS WITHOUT YOUR HELP. THE VICTORY IN NOVEMBER IS CONTINGENT UPON LATINO VOTERS, PARTICULARLY IN BATTLEGROUND STATES. I AM COMMITTED TO SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THE LATINO COMMUNITY . I HAVE A SIGNIFICANT STEP. WE ARE TRYING TO ADVERTISE ON LATINO STATIONS, SPANISH-SPEAKING STATIONS. WE NEED EVERY SINGLE VOTER TO SIGN UP, GET ENGAGED IN OUR CAMPAIGN. WE NEED YOU TO GET OUT AND VOTE WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS. MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO REGISTER AND HOW TO VOTE SAFELY DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE NEED TO PROVIDE VOTERS WITH MORE OPTIONS, NOT FEWER AND TO EXPAND OPTIONS. NO EXCUSE FOR ABSENTEE BALLOTS. YOU CAN GET AN ABSENTEE BALLOT IF YOU NEED ONE OR WANT ONE. HAVE ENOUGH FOR WORKERS THAT CAN SANITIZE MACHINES AND MAKE SURE WE CAN SOCIALLY DISTANCE AND WEAR MASKS WHILE NOT TAKING AWAY MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. OUR CAMPAIGN IS PUTTING TOGETHER THE LARGEST VOTER PROTECTION PROGRAM IN HISTORY BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE TO. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE IMPACT THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON VOTING RIGHTS AND VOTING DURING THE PRIMARIES. WE KNOW VOTER SUPPRESSION WAS ALIVE AND WELL IN AMERICA BEFORE THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. THE CENSUS IS PART OF THIS TOO. EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE COUNTED. FOUR FORMER CENSUS BUREAU DIRECTORS WHO HAVE WORKED UNDER NINE PRESIDENTS HAVE CALLED ON THE SENATE AND ADMINISTRATION TO WORK TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE SO WE GET AN ACCURATE COUNT. YOU MENTIONED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. TO DATE, IT HAPPENS TO BE THE 55TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS ENACTMENT. I WORK LIKE HELL TO EXTEND THAT ACT WHEN I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE. THROUGHOUT MY CAREER GOING BACK TO 1975. BACK THEN, IN 2013 THE SUPREME COURT CAME ALONG AND STRIPPED THE TEETH OUT OF THE ACT. THEY SAID IT WAS NO LONGER NECESSARY. JUST LAST YEAR, 29 STATES INTRODUCED OR CARRIED OVER BILLS TO TRY TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE, PERIOD. THIS IS BLATANTLY UN-AMERICAN. OUR DEMOCRACY, ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE, THAT IS THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE. AND AT THE SENATE, REPUBLICAN SENATE, MITCH MCCONNELL AND DONALD TRUMP DO NOT TAKE UP THE BILL NEWLY RENAMED IN HONOR OF MY FRIEND JOHN LOTUS TO RESTORE THE ACT TO ITS FULL POWER, I WILL DO THAT ON MY FIRST DAY AS PRESIDENT. WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THANK YOU AGAIN, ARTURO, AND EVERYONE AT VALEO FOR WHAT YOU WERE DOING. TO MAKE THE COUNTRY STRONGER. YOU MAKE US ALL BETTER. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. THE COUNTRY IS BETTER, STRONGER, OR PROSPEROUS, MORE DECENT, MORE HONORABLE IF WE IN FACT REACH OUT AND GET THE LARGEST POPULATION OF IMMIGRANTS IN THE WORLD, IN THE UNITED STATES AND INCLUDE THEM ACROSS THE BOARD. IT IS A SOURCE OF AMAZING STRENGTH FOR US. I THINK BECAUSE OF THIS OPEN PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS, I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SEEING THAT NOW. AT LEAST I HOPE THAT IS THE CASE. I AM GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP TO GET ALL OF THIS DONE. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU.",

         "Thank you very much, my fellow Americans. Apart from matters of war and peace, the nomination of a Supreme Court justice is the most important decision an American President can make. For this reason, candidates for President owe the American people a specific list of the individuals they consider for the United States Supreme Court. Four years ago, I announced my first list of highly qualified candidates and promised to fill Justice Scalia's vacant seat from among , from among those names. Just days after my inauguration, I kept that promise when I nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch. And, as you know, he has been very spectacular. A year later, I nominated and the Senate confirmed another outstanding justice, Brett Kavanaugh. By the end of my first term, we will have confirmed a record number of federal judges , over 300 , all of whom will faithfully uphold our Constitution as written. What has always made America exceptional is our reverence for the impartial rule of law. People have come here from all over the world to pursue the American Dream based on this sacred principle. Equality under the law is the bedrock of our society. It is the principle that inspired American heroes to abolish slavery and end segregation, secure civil rights, and build the most free and just nation in history. Unfortunately, there is a growing radical-left movement that rejects the principle of equal treatment under law. If this extreme movement is granted a majority on the Supreme Court, it will fundamentally transform America without a single vote of Congress. Radical justices will erase the Second Amendment, silence political speech, and require taxpayers to fund extreme late-term abortion. They will give unelected bureaucrats that power to destroy millions of American jobs. They will remove the words 'under God' from the Pledge of Allegiance. They will unilaterally declare the death penalty unconstitutional, even for the most depraved mass murderers. They will erase national borders, cripple police departments, and grant new protections to anarchists, rioters, violent criminals, and terrorists. In the recent past, many of our most treasured freedoms, including religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, have been saved by a single vote on the United States Supreme Court. Our cherished rights are at risk, including the right to life and our great Second Amendment. Over the next four years, America's President will choose hundreds of federal judges, and, in all likelihood, one, two, three, and even four Supreme Court justices. The outcome of these decisions will determine whether we hold fast to our nation's founding principles or whether they are lost forever. That is why today I am announcing 20 additions to my original list of candidates for the United States Supreme Court. Should there be another vacancy on the Supreme Court during my presidency, my nominee will come from the names I have shared with the American public, including the original list and these 20 additions. Joe Biden has refused to release his list, perhaps because he knows the names are so extremely far left that they could never withstand public scrutiny or receive acceptance. He must release a list of justices for people to properly make a decision as to how they will vote. It is very important that he do so. My original list of potential justices include many of our nation's brightest legal minds, such as Bill Pryor, Amy Coney Barrett, and Thomas Hardiman. Outstanding people. Like those distinguished individuals, the 20 additions I am announcing today would be jurists in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. Their names are as follows: Bridget Bade of Arizona, judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of AppealsDaniel Cameron of Kentucky, Attorney General of the Commonwealth of KentuckyPaul Clement of Virginia, former Solicitor General of the United StatesSenator Tom Cotton of ArkansasSenator Ted Cruz of TexasStuart Kyle Duncan of Louisiana, judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of AppealsSteven Engel of the District of Columbia, Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of JusticeNoel Francisco, former Solicitor General of the United StatesSenator Josh Hawley of MissouriJames Ho of Texas, judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of AppealsGregory Katsas of Virginia, judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of AppealsBarbara Lagoa of Florida, judge on the Eleventh Circuit Court of AppealsChristopher Landau of Maryland, United States Ambassador to MexicoCarlos Mu�iz of Florida, justice on the Supreme Court of FloridaMartha Pacold of Illinois, judge on the District Court for the Northern District of IllinoisPeter Phipps of Pennsylvania, judge on the Third Circuit Court of AppealsSarah Pitlyk of Missouri, judge on the District Court for the Eastern District of MissouriAllison Jones Rushing of North Carolina, judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of AppealsKate Todd of Virginia, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Counsel to the PresidentLawrence VanDyke of Nevada, judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of AppealsEvery one of these individuals will ensure equal justice, equal treatment, and equal rights for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. Together, we will defend our righteous heritage and preserve our magnificent American way of life.Thank you. God Bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.",

WHILE INSURANCE COMPANIES COME IN AT THE MOST VULNERABLE MOMENTS FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS, I REMEMBER WHEN MY SON BEAU WAS LYING IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER HE CAME HOME FROM IRAQ AFTER A YEAR. HE HAD STAGE IV GLIOBLASTOMA. THEY DIDN'T TELL HIM HOW LONG HE WAS GOING TO LIVE. AS HE LAID THERE FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE, FIGHTING TO HANG ON, I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE IF MY INSURANCE COMPANY, HIS INSURANCE COMPANY SAID YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF COVERAGE. TIME'S UP. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. FOLKS, IT'S A QUESTION NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO FACE IN AMERICA. THAT IS WHY I FOUGHT SO HARD AND WHY OBAMACARE WAS SUCH A BIG THING. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE. IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE DONALD TRUMP, FROM THE DAY HE GOT ELECTED TO RIGHT NOW, HE IS FIGHTING IN COURT TO RIP THAT AWAY FROM TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET HIM DO IT. WE ARE NEVER GOING BACK TO THOSE DAYS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN, FOR YOU, JESSICA, AND YOUR FAMILY. I PROMISE YOU I WILL PROTECT YOUR FAMILY AS IF IT WERE MY OWN. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE SPEAKERS YOU HEARD EARLIER. YOUR GOVERNOR, LEADING MINNESOTA WITH DECENCY AND INTEGRITY. ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, LET'S SEND HER BACK TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WE NEED HER BADLY. AND YOUR INCREDIBLE JUNIOR SENATOR, TINA SMITH , SHE HAS GOT TO GO BACK. AND LOOK, LET'S WIN BACK THE MINNESOTA STATE SENATE WHILE WE ARE AT IT. ONE OF THE NATION'S FINEST LEADERS IN A DEAR FRIEND, I'VE BEEN HONORED TO STAND ALONGSIDE AND FIGHT TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME, SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR. AMY, I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. YESTERDAY, AND FLORIDA, HAD A CHANCE TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME WITH ANOTHER IN , ANOTHER MINNESOTA ICON. CARL ANTHONY TOWNS. BOY, HE CAN PLAY, MAN. YOU KNOW HIM AS THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE TIMBERWOLVES, BUT HE'S ALSO A SON, WHO LIKE MANY OTHER AMERICANS LOST HIS MOM TO COVID 19 A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. FOR ALL THOSE SONS AND DAUGHTERS, THOSE PARENTS, SIBLINGS, HUSBANDS, AND WIVES FACING EMPTY CHAIRS AT DINING ROOM TABLES, ALL OF THOSE WHO REACH OVER AT NIGHT TO SAY GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR HUSBAND OR WIFE, THEY DESERVE SO MUCH BETTER. THESE GUYS ARE NOT VERY POLITE, BUT THEY ARE LIKE TRUMP. THEY ARE GOING TO BE OK. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AS WELL. WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND FIGHT FOR ALL THESE FOLKS. WE HAVE FOUR DAYS LEFT TO GET IT DONE. FOUR DAYS. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALREADY VOTING. MILLIONS MORE WILL VOTE BY TUESDAY. AND I BELIEVE WHEN YOU USE YOUR POWER TO VOTE, IT WILL CHANGE THE COURSE OF THIS COUNTRY IN THE COURSE OF HISTORY. RIGHT HERE IN MINNESOTA, WITH ALL OF YOU, IN THE FINAL DAYS, KEEP THAT SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT. KEEP THAT SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT, THAT SENSE OF OPTIMISM SO WE CAN OVERCOME. THERE'S A REASON THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR ME. THEY KNOW THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING, SO THEY ARE NOT USED TO NOT HEARING ANYTHING. I KNOW IT'S HARD, FOLKS. MORE THAN 20028I BELIEVE NOW THOUSAND AMERICANS HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF COVID-19. NEARLY 2500 HERE IN MINNESOTA, GONE. WE HAVE 9 MILLION NEW CASES NATIONWIDE. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE OUT OF WORK. ON THE EDGE, THEY CAN'T SEE ANY LIGHT, THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING, AND DONALD TRUMP HAS SIMPLY GIVEN UP. OVER THE WEEKEND, WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, CHIEF OF STAFF, HE SAID THE FOLLOWING , WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. AT THE DEBATE LAST WEEK, DONALD TRUMP TURNED TO ME AND SAID WE ARE ROUNDING THE CORNER, IT'S GOING AWAY. WE ARE LEARNING TO LIVE WITH THAT. I TOLD HIM, HE'S ASKING US TO LEARN TO DIE WITH IT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO. DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID TODAY? WHAT HE SAID TODAY ON THE TRAIL, HE SAID OUR DOCTORS, OUR DOCTORS, OUR FIRST RESPONDERS, OVER A THOUSAND LOST THEIR LIVES , PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE, BUSTING THEIR NEXT, HE SAID THEY ARE MAKING UP DEATHS FROM COVID BECAUSE THEY GET MORE MONEY. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS ACCUSING THE MEDICAL PROFESSION OF MAKING UP COVID DEATHS SO THEY MAKE MORE MONEY. DOCTORS AND NURSES GO TO WORK EVERY DAY TO SAVE LIVES. THEY DO THEIR JOBS. DONALD TRUMP SHOULD STOP ATTACKING THEM AND DO HIS JOB. FOLKS, THIS IS THE SAME MAN WHO WEEKS AGO, WHEN HE WAS TOLD WE ARE LOSING A THOUSAND LIVES A DAY, RUN NUMBER WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID IT IS WHAT IT IS. THAT'S THOUGHTFUL. IT IS WHAT IT IS BECAUSE HE IS WHO HE IS. DONALD TRUMP HAS WAVED THE WHITE FLAG AND SURRENDERED TO THIS VIRUS. BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T GIVE UP. THEY DON'T COWER. REMEMBER WHEN HE DID THAT INTERVIEW AND TOLD BOB WOODWARD THAT HE KNEW ABOUT THE VIRUS AND HOW DEADLY IT WAS AT THE END OF JANUARY BUT DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. AND WOODWARD ASKED HIM WHY. HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T PANIC. DONALD TRUMP PANICKED. UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, WE WILL NOT SURRENDER TO THIS VIRUS. LOOK, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SPREADING DIVISION AND DISCORD. HE THINKS HE CAN DIVIDE US. WE WON'T NOTICE HIS FAILURES. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. THAT'S WHY HE SHAMELESSLY EQUATES SOMALI REFUGEES, FOLKS SEEKING A BETTER LIFE IN AMERICA WITH TERRORISTS AS HE DID LAST NIGHT. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL BRING US TOGETHER, NOT PULL US APART. I WILL DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC RESPONSIBLY, BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AROUND TESTING, TRACING. IT'S ESTIMATED BY THE LEADING DOCTORS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IF WE JUST WORE A MASK FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, WE WOULD SAVE OVER 100,000 LIVES OF THE 200,000 LIVES WE EXPECT TO LOSE. DR. FAUCI CALLED FOR A MASK MANDATE LAST WEEK. THIS IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT LIKE THOSE UGLY THINGS OVER THERE BEEPING THE HORNS. THIS IS A PATRIOTIC DUTY, FOR GOD SAKE. LOOK, IN HIS OWN WORDS, AS I SAID, THE PRESIDENT KNEW BACK IN JANUARY HOW EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND COMMUNICABLE THIS DISEASE WAS. HE WENT ON AND MADE THAT TAPE, HE SAID THE DISEASE WAS EASILY ABLE TO SPREAD, BUT HE DID NOTHING. HE DID NOTHING AT ALL. LOOK, FOLKS, AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TOUGH. INSTEAD OF TALKING AND POLITICIZING THE VACCINE, HE SHOULD BE PLANNING FOR A SAFE, EQUITABLE AND FREE DISTRIBUTION OF A VACCINE WHEN IT COMES NEXT YEAR. THIS GUY REFUSES TO PROVIDE SCHOOLS AND SMALL BUSINESSES THE RESOURCES AND THE NATIONAL STANDARD TO OPEN SAFELY. THE HOUSE OF PAST THE MONEY TO ALLOW SCHOOLS TO OPEN SAFELY, BUSINESSES TO OPEN SAFELY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE PAID. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE WILL BRING REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TOGETHER TO BRING RELIEF FOR WORKING FAMILIES, SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES. I'M NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE ECONOMY. I'M GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE VIRUS. DONALD TRUMP INHERITED A STRONG ECONOMY THAT BARACK AND I GAVE HIM. BUT GUESS WHAT? LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HE INHERITED, HE SQUANDERED IT. LIKE EVERYTHING HE HAS INHERITED. BUT WE CAN BUILD BACK AND WE CAN BUILD BACK BETTER WITH AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT WEALTH. WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES. I PROMISE YOU, YOU HAVE MY WORD, IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR, YOU WON'T PAY A PENNY MORE IN TAXES. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME, THE WEALTHIEST AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS ARE GOING TO START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. 91 OUT OF THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES PAID ZERO IN TAXES LAST YEAR. WHY? HEARING THAT GUY BLOWING HIS HORN, WHY SHOULD HE PAY, WHY SHOULD A NURSE PAY HIGHER TAX RATES THAN THE SUPER WEALTHY? WHY SHOULD YOU PAY MORE TAXES THEN DONALD TRUMP PAYS? HE HAS EXPLOITED EVERY LOOPHOLE AND TAX CODE, HE HAS RUN A SHELL GAME TO AVOID PAYING TAXES. IF YOU NOTICE, I RELEASED 22 YEARS OF MY TAX RETURNS. HE'S NOT RELEASED ONE SINGLE YEAR. WHAT IS HE HIDING? WHERE'S THE CORRUPTION? ACCORDING TO TRUMP, THE REASON AIOLI PAY $750 IS BECAUSE HE SMART. WHAT DOES THAT MAKE THE REST OF US TO PAY OUR FAIR SHARE, MR. PRESIDENT? WE ARE GOING TO DELIVER TAX RELIEF FOR WORKING FAMILIES, HELP YOU PAY FOR HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS OR CHILDCARE OR CARE FOR YOUR AGING PARENTS OR BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR SCHOOL. TRUMP GOT A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE , FIRST TIME IT HAS EVER HAPPENED WHILE AN ELECTION HAS ALREADY STARTED , FOR ONE REASON. HE'S DETERMINED TO DO WHAT HE COULDN'T DO FOR FOUR YEARS, DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IF THEY GET THEIR WAY, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE THEIR PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. COMPLICATIONS FOR COVID-19 WILL BE THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, ALLOWING INSURERS TO JACK UP YOUR PREMIUMS OR DENY YOU COVERAGE. AND WE WILL AGAIN BE ABLE TO BE CHARGED MORE FOR THE SAME HEALTH CARE JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE A WOMAN. DONALD TRUMP THINKS HEALTH CARE IS A PRIVILEGE. I THINK IT IS YOUR RIGHT. AND IF YOU ALL GET OUT AND VOTE, WE WILL NOT ONLY RESTORE OBAMACARE, WE WILL EXPAND IT AND BUILD ON IT. YOU CAN KEEP YOUR INSURANCE IF YOU LIKE OR CHOOSE A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION, A PUBLIC OPTION. WE WILL INCREASE SUBSIDIES, LOWER YOUR PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES, OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING, REDUCED COSTS BY 60% BY ALLOWING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE WITH DRUG PRICES. WE WILL KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. I WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. MEANWHILE, THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACTUARY SAID IF DONALD TRUMP SAYS ELECT ME AGAIN AND I'M GOING TO CHANGE SOCIAL SECURITY. THE ACTUARY SAID THE CHANGES HE PUTS IN PLACE, SOCIAL SECURITY WOULD BE BANKRUPT IN 2023. SO GO HOME AND TELL YOUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WHAT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO DO. I WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. FOLKS, NOTHING IS WORSE THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT THOSE WHO SERVE IN UNIFORM. HE CALLED THEM LOSERS AND SUCKERS. MY SON BEAU GAVE UP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S SEAT IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE TO VOLUNTEER TO GO TO A RACK FOR A YEAR. HE WON THE BRONZE STAR, THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MEDAL. HE WASN'T A LOSER OR SUCKER. HE WAS A PATRIOT. SO MANY OF YOU AS WELL. NO WONDER THE SIX GENERALS WHO WORKED DIRECTLY FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAVE LEFT AND SAYS HE DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ANY PRESIDENT BEFORE. THAT'S WHY SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMANDER STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, NAVY SEAL COMMANDER ADMIRAL CREMA AND, OH , OVER 24 STARS , OVER 20 FOUR STARS ENDORSED ME BECAUSE THEY TRUST ME. THAT'S WHY THE MILITARY TIMES REPORTED MORE TROOPS VOTE FOR BIDEN THEN TRUMP. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THE MILITARY. THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY. LET THEM VOTE AND VOTE FOR THEM. WHEN DONALD TRUMP FAILED TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACY, WE CAN DELIVER ON RACIAL JUSTICE. SEEING PROTESTERS ACROSS THE NATION, THE LIFE AND DIGNITY AND GEORGE FLOYD KILLED SEVEN MILES FROM HERE AND SO MANY OTHERS , PROTESTING, BURNING AND LOOTING IS NOT PROTESTING , IT VIOLENCE, CLEAR AND SIMPLE AND WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. BUT THESE PROTESTS ARE A CRY FOR JUSTICE. THE NAMES GEORGE FLOYD, BREONNA TAYLOR COME IN JACOB BLAKE WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN, NOT BY ME, NOT BY US, NOT BY THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE TRUE JUSTICE IS ALSO ECONOMIC JUSTICE. ACCESS TO SCHOOLING, HOUSING, ACCESS TO CAPITAL, GOOD PAYING JOBS WITH FINANCIAL STABILITY, GIVING FAMILIES OF COLOR A REAL SHOT TO OWN A HOME, START A SMALL BUSINESS, SEND A CHILD TO COLLEGE THEY CAN BUILD WEALTH AND PASS ON OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THE GENERATIONS LIKE THE REST OF US HAVE. WE HAVE TO VOTE TO ENSURE THE FULL PROMISE OF THIS COUNTRY FOR EVERYONE. FINALLY, WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR THE CHALLENGES OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THE WEST IS ON FIRE, LOSING MORE FORESTS THAN THE TOTAL LAND OF CONNECTICUT AND RHODE ISLAND COMBINED. THE MIDWEST IS FLOODING. HERE IN MINNESOTA, IT INCURS BIG COSTS, INCREASE FLOODING IN MISSISSIPPI. IN SAINT PAUL, , DONALD TRUMP THINKS IT'S ALL A HOAX. HE SURE IS A STABLE GENIUS. HE SAID WIND POWER CAUSES CANCER. I SAY IT CREATES JOBS, MINNESOTA JOBS. WE CAN COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE, BUILDING A MORE RESILIENT NATION AND CREATING MILLIONS OF NEW HIGH-PAYING JOBS. WE CAN CHANGE THE PATH WE ARE ON. NOTHING IS BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. HONK YOUR HORN IF YOU WANT AMERICA TO LEAD AGAIN. HONK YOUR HORN IF YOU WANT AMERICANS TO TRUST EACH OTHER AGAIN. HONK YOUR HORN IF YOU WANT TO HAVE STABILITY AGAIN. AND HONK YOUR HORN IF YOU WANT AMERICA TO BE UNITED AGAIN. WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. YOU PLACED YOUR TRUST IN ME AND IN BARACK OBAMA AND WE WORKED FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. I WILL DO IT AGAIN. MY CAMPAIGN IS A BROAD COALITION OF DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, REPUBLICAN OFFICEHOLDERS. I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO, BECAUSE THAT IS THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT. YOU HAVE A SACRED DUTY, THE DUTY TO VOTE. IT MATTERS. MINNESOTA MATTERS. STAY OPTIMISTIC, STAY UNITED. MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE. HELP GET OUT THE VOTE. AND GO ONLINE. THERE WAS A LAST-MINUTE CHANGE IN THE ROLES, ABSENTEE BALLOTS HAVE TO BE IN BY TUESDAY. DROP IT OFF, DO NOT PUT IT IN THE MAIL, OR VOTE SAFELY AND PERSON IN A DAY UP UNTIL ELECTION DAY, BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO GET IT DONE. AND MAKE SURE EVERYONE YOU KNOW VOTES AS WELL. SO THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP US, DESPITE TRUMP'S EFFORTS. A PRESS ARTICLE POINTS OUT THAT 'NEVER BEFORE IN MODERN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS , NEVER BEFORE IN MODERN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS HAS A CANDIDATE BEEN SO RELIANT ON WIDESPREAD EFFORTS TO REPRESS THE VOTE AS TRUMP.' WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. OVER 85 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED. 85 MILLION. THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH. LOOK, I WILL NEVER FORGET THE WORDS PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID WHEN HE PROMISED TO SEND US TO THE MOON. HE SAID WE WERE DOING IT BECAUSE IN AMERICA WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE. I REFUSED TO POSTPONE THE WORK AMERICA MUST DO. THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY, NO LIMIT TO AMERICA, INCLUDING GUYS LIKE THAT. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN DOING SINCE THE BEGINNING. DIVIDING AMERICA, PITTING AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER BASED ON RACE, ETHNICITY, NATIONAL ORIGIN. THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. LET'S KEEP SHOWING HIM WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. SCIENCE OVER FICTION. AND, YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES , OVER LIES. SO IT IS TIME TO STAND UP, TAKE BACK OUR DEMOCRACY. WE CAN DO THIS. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE CAN BE WHO WE ARE AT OUR BEST, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.",

         "Can we please hear for Rebecca Al Kona, she is phenomenal. You know, when I look at Rebecca, I know our future is bright. I know our future as a country is bright. She is extraordinary. She has been a leader in this campaign. She is someone who walks and talks with confidence, having life experiences and knowing when she walks in that room. Yes, sister. Sometimes we may be the only one that looks like that's walking in that room, having had the experiences that we've had, but the thing we all know is we never walk in those rooms alone. We are all in that room together. So proud of you. How's everybody doing? It's so good to see you. Texas Bernie's. It is so good to see you. Let me just I want to first acknowledge all the leaders. Everybody here is the leader. Um, Bishop Spears. Where's bishops? Fears there. Hello, Bishop. Thank you for welcoming us in such a warm way. Thank you, Bishop. A. Dede McGuire. I talked to her earlier. Where is she? Hi, DD Thank you. Thank you for your showing. Your voice. Fred Haman and Marvin Sapp. Where are they? Oh, my God. I felt like I was a good revival. There we are. Thank you both. Just the gift that you have and that you keep sharing and giving. Thank you. Um, Eddie Bernice Johnson, the great Congresswoman, and Marc Veasey. We are on his home turf. Thank you for letting me be here. And Colin, add wral red. Where is he? And Colin Allred and we are all colleagues in the United States Congress. We are also members of the Congressional Black Caucus. And I will tell you, Texas, you are so well represented in the United States Congress with these three. And there are always in these rooms. And, you know, I see them in the rooms where the cameras are and where the cameras are not. And they are always fighting for the people of Texas. They are leaders for Texas, and they are national leaders, and they represent the voice of all people. So well, so thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. So, listen, today is the last day of early voting in Texas, and you all have been doing your thing. What did I hear? Was it? Nine million people have voted so far early voting in Texas. Nine million. Now, we know this is no time to let up on the pedal, though, right? So I know people were people sent me pictures of standing in line at midnight this morning, I guess last night waiting to vote, there was a line. People are committed. And so today is the last day of early voting in Texas. We want to make sure we see it through, and then let's make sure on election Day everybody we know has made sure that their voice, their powerful voice, is represented in this election through their vote because there is so much at stake and so many reasons to vote, you know, just think about it right now. In our country, we are in the middle of at least four obvious crises, right? There's the crisis that is a public health crisis that has caused over 215 I think now over 220,000 people to die in just the last several months. And the tragedy of it is so many because of the nature of this pandemic. Spent their last hours on Earth without even the benefit off, holding the hand and touching someone they love, maybe communicating through a video, but without the warmth of the family around them. 8.5 million Almost nine million people have contracted this virus with untold long term consequences. You know, doctors, we're talking about things like lung scarring. It will, by the way, at this point, most likely qualify as a pre existing condition, which means on top of the numbers that we know the disproportionate numbers in terms of African Americans and Latinos for high blood pressure and diabetes were now looking at this. Let's look at the racial disparities on this virus. African Americans and Latinos there three times as likely to contract the disease and twice as likely to die from the tragedy of the loss of human life. You know, I've been referring to. This is one of the greatest mass casualty events that we've experienced since World War Two. The tragedy of it. And here's why I bring it up, guys. It didn't have to be this bad. It didn't have to be this bad. Just think about it. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know that the president of the United States was informed back on January 28th about the seriousness of this virus. Informed that it is five times as likely to kill people as the flu was informed that it would hurt, people of every age was informed that it is airborne, and he sat on that information. He called it a hoax. He suggested that on his ledger of who people are, you're on one side of his ledger. If you wear a mask, you're on the other side of his ledger. If you don't and can you imagine as parents as teachers as small business owners what you might have done if on January 28th you had known what the president of the United States said down what you might have done to prepare knowing that even before this pandemic, far too many Americans were working two and three jobs to try and pay the rent and put food on the table. And by the way, and Joe Biden and my America, nobody should work more than one job toe, have to put food on the table and pay the rent. But what folks might have done to prepare knowing that most working families don't have even $1000 in savings what people might have done to prepare small business owners workers? Because, you see still, even before this pandemic, which has been highlighted, we have a country that has not made it a national priority for working people to have paid sick leave and paid family leave. That will change in a Biden Harris administration, but what people might have done to prepare teachers and students and parents around the fact that their Children are gonna miss so much of these critical days of their education what people might have done to prepare to just simply by a couple of extra rolls of toilet paper. But they sat on this information and they didn't tell anybody. And now we are looking at a situation where, in the midst of a public health pandemic, you also have a situation where we have a president who, while we're seeing spikes around our country, talking about we've turned the corner, continuing to mislead the American people. So there are clear choices in this election because on the one hand you have Joe Biden, who, together with President Barack Obama, created Obama care, which brought health care to over 20 million people and protected people with preexisting conditions and understood that healthcare and access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. Joe Biden, who says we will expand on the Affordable Care Act Obama care. We will extend protections. We will bring down the cost of prescription drugs. We will bring down the cost of premiums. We will lower Medicare eligibility to age 60. We will expand health care understanding the body doesn't just start from the neck down. It includes the neck up and we need to expand mental health care. Clear choices because, you see, on the other hand, you have Donald Trump who, together with his boy Bill Bar, are in the United States Supreme Court right now trying to sue to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which again brought health care to so many people here in Texas. We're looking at 10 million Texans who have pre existing conditions. If they are successful with that lawsuit, all of the folks who have the over 20 million people are likely to lose their protections, and we now have almost 89 million people who have new pre existing conditions called Cove in. There are clear choices in this election because of this pandemic. The worsening off the wealth gap in America has been such that over 30 million people in just the last several months had to file for unemployment insurance. We are seeing numbers that tell us one in five mothers who has a child under the age of 12 is describing her Children is being hungry here in Texas. We're looking at the numbers that tell us that one in eight households is describing their household is having been hungry. We're in the middle of a hunger crisis in America. They're not covering it enough. We're in the middle of a hunger crisis. Here in Texas, one in six households has described not being able to pay their rent or being concerned that they cannot pay their rent next month. Here in Texas, one in four small businesses has gone out of business. And let's be clear. Across America, almost 50% of the workforce either owns a small business or runs a small business. We are looking at an economic devastation that is being compared to the Great Depression, and on the one hand you have Joe Biden who says, You wanna ask me about the economy and how it's doing? Then you need to tell me how working people are doing how our families doing in America. Which is why Joe Biden is committed to not raising taxes ever on anyone making less than $400,000 a year lowering middle cltaxes, also making sure that no working family pays more than 7% of your income in child care. Making sure there's a $15,000 tax credit for first time home buyers. Understanding that is the way that we have intergenerational wealth in America is to allow people toe own a home. That's how Joe Biden thinks of the economy. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who, when asked, How's the economy doing? He will ask. Well, how's the stock market doing? He asks. How are rich people doing as one of his first orders of business? He passed a tax code benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America. Well, let me tell you, Joe Biden and I, if we win about to get rid of that and invest that money in working people in America, invest that money in building back up our infrastructure, our roads and our bridges and renewable energy, creating millions of jobs, investing that money in making sure that our students, coming from families that make less than $225,000 go thio Public universities tuition free, including HBC use, including private HBC use ensuring that our students, when they graduate if they take on a life of service and public service and a job that pays less than $125,000 that their debt will be erased. That's how we'll invest that money in the American people crises. We are facing a long overdue reckoning on the issue of racial injustice in America, and there are clear choice. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is a student of American history and has the courage to speak the phrase black lives matter. Hey, Joe Biden, who understands that we need to deal with these racial disparities? We need to acknowledge them. Difficult though they may be to think about much less talk about. We need to address it in terms of what we're doing around health care. We need to address it in terms of the racial wealth gap. We need to address it in terms of the gaps in our education system, Joe Biden says. Let's deal with it by putting $150 billion into low interest loans for minority businesses, black and brown businesses, which tend to be the economic lifeblood of the community, Joe Biden says Let's deal with it in terms of a criminal justice system that must be held accountable for those disparities. Let's get rid of mandatory minimums. Let us decriminalized marijuana and expunge the record of the people who have been convicted for marijuana offenses. Let's shut down the private prisons. Let's get rid of cash bail. Understanding. People are sitting in jail for weeks, months and years simply because they can't afford to get out, which makes it uneconomic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue. And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who, on a debate stage two debates ago refused to condemn white supremacists and then double down and said they should stand back and stand by Donald Trump because you've got to understand this is a pattern who, when running for office and even before, had the gall thio question and challenge the legitimacy of America's first black president, the commander in chief of the United States, who, when asked about the tragedy in Charlottesville were peaceful. Protesters were pro testing racial injustice, and ah, young woman was killed. And then on the other side there were neo Nazis wearing swastikas carrying tiki torches, hurling racial and anti Semitic epithets. The commander in chief said there were fine people on both sides. A president of the United States who has called Mexicans rapists and criminals who, as his first order of business instituted a Muslim ban America. We deserve better that does not reflect who we are as our values and priorities as a nation that knows we are are strongest when we are unified knows that we have so much more in common, regardless of where you live, the race, your ethnicity, the language of grandmother speaks. We know we have so much more in common, and we have a choice in this election to elect a Joe Biden who says we are, as a first order of priority going to unify our country and bring us back together as a nation who values the importance of giving each other respect and dignity clear choices in this election, not to mention the other crisis we are facing, which is a climate crisis. Texas. You know that well, you look at what's going on around our country up and down the West Coast, you know, I'm from California. Up and down the West Coast, California toe upto Washington over to Colorado, wildfires that are burning out whole communities. I've met families that are being evacuated or been evacuated never to return to their home firefighters who were fighting fires while their own homes were burned. And my brother in law's a firefighter. Tragedies. You look at the Gulf Coast states, the neighbor, our neighbors to Texas being battered by these these storms. There have been now five named storms just this year, and you know they name a storm because it's really bad. So Zeta being the last one, the most recent in the Midwest, you're seeing floods that have caused farmers to lose. Ah, whole season of crops, Joe Biden says. We need to deal with this with a sense of urgency. We must embrace the science on this. We cannot play politics on this, and we see that in this moment of opportunity tohave timelines, understanding. We must deal with this with a sense of urgency that we also have the opportunity to grow our economy and create jobs. Joe seize the opportunity in the moment to invest in renewable energies, to invest in the apprenticeship programs with the folks like the building trades, knowing that we have a moment of opportunity to invest in America's auto industry and be the best in the world and production of electric vehicles. All of these are opportunities to meet a moment of crisis if you are a real leader. And on the other hand, you have the current president of the United States, who, when he was asked about the wildfires in California. So he was asked by a journalist. And the question was something like, Well, you know, Mr President, these wildfires air happening and and scientists are telling us there's a real connection between climate, with the extreme changes and and human behaviors that are contributing to that. And and what do you have to say? The president of the United States, who is also again the commander in chief, responded. Science doesn't know as those science is a person. Can you believe science doesn't know? So you know, and there's a routine through theme here, too, because right, that's how he's been treating the coronavirus right? A refusal to embrace the people who are smart enough to know what is actually going on and give us some direction around how we need to deal with it. Instead of trying to make everything everybody think everything's okay as as though people aren't smart enough to see what is happening around them. So all these things are at play and so much more. And and that brings me to this moment where we are today. I'm here in Texas to thank you for all you have been doing to speak up about these challenges and to remind people to vote here on the last day of early voting four days before the end of the election. And I'm here to talk about it in the context of also understanding that, um, there's a lot that we need to get done. And, um and there are a lot of reasons for folks to vote. And, you know, people ask me a lot, Why should I vote? Does it matter? And I think there are three reasons that it is important that people vote one is to honor the ancestors, honor the ancestors. I mean, you know, we Bernice Mark, we all know we lost in incredible American human. It's just a hero. Um, in Congressman John Lewis, just a hero. He is now among the ancestors John Lewis, who shed his blood on that Edmund Pettus Bridge. John Lewis, who said to us, Get in good trouble. John Lewis, who lived a life that was about a commitment to fighting for equal rights and civil rights. And it was a fight that was born out of being a patriot and loving our country. Knowing the best way we achieve our ideals is to fight for those ideals, to do it in every way by standing up, showing up and speaking up. So we must vote toe honor the ancestors. This year we celebrated the 19th Amendment, the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment. The ancestors, the suffragettes who those 100 years ago in all of their white, marching and shouting for a woman's right to vote, saying we will not be deterred. We will not be left behind. Now let us remember, because we always must speak truth about history, that black women couldn't vote until 1965. So we have to remember that. But yes, it is important toe honor Those who fought for this precious right understanding that like Coretta Scott King told us the fight for civil rights for equal rights for human rights. This fight for justice must be fought and won with each generation. And what she meant is it is precious, Thies writes. But you cannot take them for granted. We must be vigilant. So we've vote to honor the ancestors. We vote because everything is at stake. Everything is at stake, like let's think about where we are. We talked about it in terms of these crises. I mean, let's talk about it in terms of these 545 babies who right now have been orphaned because of a failure of the United States government to reunify them with their parents. Let's talk about a nation under this administration that had a policy of separating Children from their parents at the border, a nation that broke its promise to the dreamers in terms of not following through on a commitment around DACA protections. There are so many things at stake, so that is a reason to vote. And the third reason is this. So I'm traveling the country. Andi, I've been thio in the last week and a half. In fact, I'm going back to Florida tomorrow. Um, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, I Michigan. I mean, you just name it, okay. And, um, and one of the things that we have been seeing certainly since 2013 before for sure. But since 2013 when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, as we've been seeing, as many as two dozen states putting in place laws through their state Legislature that have been designed to suppress the vote have been designed to make it difficult for people to vote have been done in such a way. You've seen that in Texas, where they're trying to remove the drop boxes where they're trying to reduce the number of polls where they're saying If you vote from home, you need to fill out two envelopes. I mean all kinds of things right. Leaders who have trying to make it difficult and confusing and to suggest you can't trust the process. In fact, at that first debate, the president, United States took that stage in front of 70 million Americans and in my opinion, openly encouraged a suppression of the vote, not to mention what he's doing and what they're doing to mess with the post office. The post office, the best people in the world work for the post office, the post office. So we have to ask, Why do we think so many powerful people are going out of their way to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote. And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. So let us not let anyone ever take our power from us. Let us use the power of our strong voices every day in the spirit of John Lewis in the spirit of the suffragettes, in the spirit of all of the generations of people here and in the future who are counting on us to know what is at stake and to step up and to stand up and to fight for this country we love. Yeah, that is what is before us. And so my final point is this. This moment will pass. It will pass. And years from now, our Children and our grandchildren and others, they will look at us, each one of us. They're gonna look in our eyes and they will ask us, where were you at that moment? And you see, we're going to be able to tell them so much more than just how we felt forward. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them. On this particular Friday afternoon, on the last day of early voting in Texas, we were sitting in the field hanging out with Camilla. We will tell them we texted everybody called everybody emailed everybody. We knew that, Yes, we knew we were kind of getting on their nerves. But we also knew they get over it, that we reminded people of the path that we are on. That the shoulders upon which we stand that we reminded people about what is at stake and that we reminded people about their power. And in this moment where we are dealing with crises, we reminded our friends and our neighbors and our family that you are not alone. Don't let anyone make you feel small that you are big. You are strong, you have power. And at election time that power will be through your vote. And you will tell them when they ask that you elected Joe Biden, the president of the United States. Thank you Fort Worth. And God bless Texas.",

         "LAST NIGHT, WE SAW THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND REPEATEDLY LIE ABOUT THE STATE OF THIS PANDEMIC. WE SAW HIM REFUSED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CRISIS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MET WITH PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. INSTEAD, IT HAS COST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN LIVES AND PUSHED MILLIONS INTO POVERTY. WE SAW HIM DIMINISH THE PAIN FELT BY SO MANY AMERICANS. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, WE ARE ROUNDING THE CORNER, IT IS GOING AWAY, WE ARE LEARNING TO LIVE WITH IT. THEY ARE QUOTES. AS I TOLD HIM LAST NIGHT, WE ARE NOT LEARNING TO LIVE WITH IT, WE ARE LEARNING TO DIE WITH IT. THIS IS A DARK WINTER AHEAD. ALREADY, MORE THAN 200 20,000 PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS VIRUS. 220,000 EMPTY CHAIRS AT DINNER TABLES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. MY HEART GOES OUT TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAS HAD TO E NDURE THE AGONY OF SAYING GOODBYE TO SOMEONE THEY LOVED OVER VIDEO CHAT, WHO COULD NOT GATHER THEIR CLOSEST FRIENDS, EVEN THEIR FULL FAMILY TO GRIEVE TOGETHER AT A FUNERAL SERVICE. WORSE YET, A NEW STUDY FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SUGGESTS THAT ANYWHERE BETWEEN 130,000 AND 210,000 OF THOSE DEATHS WERE AVOIDABLE. LEADING MEDICAL JOURNAL IN AMERICA, FRANKLY IN THE WORLD, WROTE AN UNPRECEDENTED EDITORIAL , TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE NEVER WRITTEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THEY CRITICIZE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DANGEROUSLY INCOMPETENT RESPONSE AND STATED THAT HE TOOK A CRISIS AND TURNED IT INTO A TRAGEDY. COVID-19 DWARFS ANYTHING WE HAVE FACED IN RECENT HISTORY AND IT IS NOT SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. THE VIRUS IS SURGING IN ALMOST EVERY STATE. WE PASSED 4.8 MILLION CASES. WHEN TRUMP WAS ASKED THIS WEEK WHAT HE WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY TO GET THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE RIGHT FROM THE START, HIS ANSWER WAS, AND I QUOTE, NOT MUCH. NOT MUCH. AS MANY AS 210,000 AVOIDABLE DEATHS, THERE IS NOT MUCH HE WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY? THE UNITED STATES IS 4% OF THE ENTIRE WORLD POPULATION, YET WE MAKE UP 20% OF ALL THE DEATHS WORLDWIDE. IF THIS IS A SUCCESS, WHAT DOES A FAILURE LOOK LIKE? WE ARE MORE THAN EIGHT MONTHS INTO THIS CRISIS, THE PRESIDENT STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN. HE HAS GIVEN UP. HE HAS QUIT ON YOU. HE HAS QUIT ON YOUR FAMILY. HE HAS QUIT ON AMERICA. HE JUST WANTS US TO GO NUMB AND RESIGN TO THE HORRORS OF THIS DEATH TOLL AND THE PAIN IT IS CAUSING SO MANY AMERICANS. HE CAN'T ERASE HIS OWN WORDS OR DEEDS. IN FEBRUARY, HE KNEW HOW DANGEROUS THIS VIRUS WAS. HE TOLD BOB WOODWARD, THIS DISEASE WAS DEADLY, FAR WORSE THAN THE FLU. BUT INSTEAD OF TELLING US HOW BAD IT WAS GOING TO BE, ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES, HIS ADMINISTRATION ONLY GAVE WALL STREET INVESTORS A HEADS UP. THEY MADE A BUNDLE DOING SOMETHING CALLED SELLING SHORT OR BETTING AGAINST THE MARKET THE REST OF US TOOK THE FULL BRUNT OF IT. IN JUNE, WHEN WE BEGIN TO SEE THE RESURGENCE OF COVID-19, I CALLED OUT PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR WAVERING, AND WAVING THE WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER TO THE VIRUS. BUT THEN, IT WAS AS IF HE DECIDED TO GO ON OFFENSE FOR THE VIRUS, HOLDING RALLIES WITH NO MASKS, NO SOCIAL DISTANCING, WHERE PEOPLE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS, INVITING THE VIRUS INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, HOSTING WHAT DR. FAUCI CALLED SUPER-SPREADER FEARS EVENTS, ENDANGERING MORE PEOPLE'S LIVES BY TELLING THE PUBLIC, DON'T WORRY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE DISEASE, DON'T LET IT DOMINATE YOU. HOW MANY PEOPLE IN ARIZONA WILL END UP SUFFERING BECAUSE THEY LISTENED TO THE PRESIDENT. KRISTIN SAID HER DAD VOTED FOR TRUMP, LISTENED TO HIM, DIDN'T THINK THE VIRUS WAS A BIG DEAL. AT DAD BECAME INFECTED , ENTER DAD BECAME INFECTED, AND HE DIED. KRISTIN SAID HER DAD'S ONLY PRE-EXISTING CONDITION WAS 'TRUSTING TRUMP.' EVEN AFTER CONTRACTING THE VIRUS HIMSELF, DONALD TRUMP STILL REFUSED TO PROMOTE UNIVERSAL MASK WEARING, WHICH COULD HAVE SAVED OVER 1000 AMERICAN LIVES, AND COULD STILL SAVE OVER WHENEVER THOUSAND AMERICAN LIVES IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THE LONGER DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENT, THE MORE RECKLESS HE GETS. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE HELD PRISONER BY THIS ADMINISTRATION'S FAILURES. WE CAN CHOOSE A DIFFERENT PATH. WE CAN COME TOGETHER WITH , WITH WHAT AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE, COME TOGETHER WITH GREAT PASSION AND DETERMINATION. I WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT I PLANNED TO DO IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING ELECTED YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT. I WILL IMMEDIATELY PUT IN PLACE A NATIONAL STRATEGY TO POSITION OUR COUNTRY TO FINALLY GET AHEAD OF THIS VIRUS, AND GET BACK OUR LIVES. I WILL REACH OUT TO EVERY GOVERNOR IN EVERY STATE, RED AND BLUE, AS WELL AS MAYORS AND LOCAL OFFICIALS, DURING TRANSITION, TO FIND OUT WHAT SUPPORT THEY NEED AND HOW MUCH OF IT THEY NEED. I WILL ASK THE NEW CONGRESS TO PUT A BILL ON MY DESK BY THE END OF JANUARY, WITH ALL THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO SEE HOW BOTH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RESPONSE CAN BE SEEN THROUGH THE END, WHAT IS NEEDED. LOOK, A PANDEMIC DOESN'T PLAY FAVORITES, NOR DO I. AS I SAID, NO RED STATES, NO BLUE STATES, JUST THE UNITED STATES, UNITED IN OUR SPOTS, UNITED IN OUR PURPOSE TO STOP THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 AND BEAT THIS VIRUS. FIRST, I WILL GO TO EVERY GOVERNOR TO GET A MASK MANDATE IN THEIR STATE SAID IF THEY REFUSE, I WILL GO TO CITY AND COUNTY EXECUTIVES TO GET LOCAL MASK MANDATES IN PLACE NATIONWIDE. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL MANDATE MASK WEARING AN ALL FEDERAL BUILDINGS AND INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION, BECAUSE MASKS SAVE LIVES. PERIOD. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN ARIZONA. THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR INITIALLY TRIED TO BAR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM INITIATING MASK MANDATES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WHAT HAPPENED? IN JUNE, ARIZONA ENTERED A SURGE OF CASES, HOSPITALS WERE FLOODED. THE STATE HEALTH SYSTEM WAS OVERWHELMED. CITIES AND COUNTIES APPEALED THE GOVERNOR'S RULING. THEY IMPOSED THEIR OWN LOCAL MANDATES, COVERING MOST OF THE STATE. THE RESULT? CASES FELL BY 75%. WEARING A MASK IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT, IT IS A SCIENTIFIC IMPERATIVE. IT IS A POINT OF PATRIOTIC PRIDE, SO WE CAN PULL OUR COUNTRY OUT OF THIS GOD-AWFUL SPIRAL THAT WE ARE IN. IT IS A TESTAMENT OF WHAT WE WERE TAUGHT BY OUR FAMILIES AND BY OUR FAITH, LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF. SECOND, I WILL PUT A NATIONAL TESTING PLAN IN PLACE WITH THE GOAL OF TESTING AS MANY PEOPLE EACH DAY AS WE ARE CURRENTLY TESTING EACH WEEK, A SEVEN-FOLD INCREASE. THERE IS A KEY DIFFERENCE IN THIS CAMPAIGN BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND ME. I BELIEVE IN TESTING. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT. I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE. I BELIEVE IN PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. I BELIEVE IN THE EXAMPLE OF OTHER COUNTRIES THAT PROVED THAT WIDESPREAD GAINS ARE NEEDED TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY OPEN CRITICALLY, EVERY SCHOOL, EVERY WORKER, EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE EASY ACCESS TO REGULAR, RELIABLE, FREE TESTING. TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE NEED TO INCREASE BOTH LAP-BASED DIAGNOSTIC TESTING WITH RESULTS BACK IN 24 HOURS OR LESS, AND FASTER, CHEAPER SCREENING TESTS THAT YOU COULD TAKE AT HOME OR IN SCHOOL. WE HAVE , WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW ISN'T ANYWHERE NEAR GOOD ENOUGH. STATES ARE STILL OPERATING ON THE FLY. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MOSTLY ON THEIR OWN. AND MANY AMERICANS STILL DON'T KNOW WHEN IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET A TEST, OR HOW. THIS ISN'T BEYOND OUR CAPACITY TO MASTER, NOT IF WE ARE DIRECTING A COORDINATED EFFORT TO CROSS GOVERNMENT ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR, INSTEAD OF LEAVING CHAOS TERRAIN , CHAOS TO REIGN. WE WILL MASS-PRODUCE THE SUPPLIES TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH TESTS AND TAP MORE OF OUR NATION'S LAB CAPACITY, SO THAT YOU CAN GET YOUR TEST RESULTS MORE QUICKLY. WE WILL BUILD A NATIONAL CORPS OF CONTACT TRACERS IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST AT RISK. WE WILL ALSO TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE HAS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GETTING A TEST AND PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND THAT NO ONE, NO ONE IS SCARED THAT BEING TESTED FOR COVID MIGHT JEOPARDIZE THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. THE ONLY WAY WE WILL DEFEAT THIS VIRUS IS IF WE DEFEAT IT EVERYWHERE. THE THIRD POINT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS, WE WILL CLOSE THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, THE PPE GAP, AND GET GEAR OUT TO WHERE IT IS NEEDED. EVERY HEALTH CARE WORKER WILL HAVE A RELIABLE SUPPLY OF PROPERLY-FITTED N95 MASKS. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE THAT MORE THAN EIGHT MONTHS INTO THIS CRISIS, FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE STILL RATIONING THEIR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL USE THE FULL POWER OF THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO DRIVE THE PRODUCTION OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, MASKS, GOWNS, GLOVES AND MORE, AND ENSURE IT IS DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY. I WON'T STOP UNTIL THE NATION'S SUPPLY EXCEEDS THE DEMAND AND OUR STOCK PILE'S PLAN IS, ESPECIALLY IN HARD-HIT AREAS AND COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE VIRUS. I WILL APPOINT A FULLY-EMPOWERED SUPPLY COMMANDER IN CHARGE OF FEELING IN THE GAPS. WE WILL MAKE SURE WE CAN MANUFACTURE CRITICAL SUPPLIES RIGHT HERE AT HOME, SO WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THIS CRISIS. FOURTH, I WILL PROVIDE CONSISTENT, RELIABLE, TRUSTED, DETAILED NATIONWIDE GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR REOPENING SAFELY, AND THE RESOURCES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. WE NEED A SINGLE SOURCE OF GUIDANCE THAT WE CAN TRUST, WHERE WE KNOW THE INFORMATION WON'T CHANGE FOR ANY REASON, OTHER THAN THE SCIENCE THAT GUIDES IT. NOT POLITICAL LICKS. IN , NOT POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY. NOT PUBLIC IMAGE. SOCIAL DISTANCING IS NOT AN ON AND OFF THING, AND WE LEARN MORE EVERY DAY ABOUT THE VIRUS AND HOW IT SPREADS. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT AND ADJUST OUR BEHAVIOR TO RESPONSIBLY RESPOND APPROPRIATELY. SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES CAN'T MAKE RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION, THE SCIENCE. IT'S NOT JUST MORE DETAILED AND EFFECTIVE GUIDANCE THEY NEED, IT IS CONSULTATIONS AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SO PEOPLE HAVE A PLACE TO TURN WITH THEIR QUESTIONS. IT IS HAVING A GOVERNMENT THAT IT IS IN YOUR CORNER, NOT A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS TURNED ITS BACK ON YOU. AND ONCE WE GOT OUR FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WORKING TOGETHER, ONCE THERE IS UNIVERSAL MASKING, ENOUGH PPE AND TESTING TO GO AROUND, SIGNS-BACKED WRITINGS TO HELP US MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS, THEN WE CAN GET OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL SAFELY, OUR BUSINESS IS GROWING, AND OUR ECONOMY GROWING AGAIN WITHOUT WASTING ANOTHER MINUTE. AS I SAID LAST NIGHT, I AM NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE ECONOMY. I AM NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE COUNTRY. I AM GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE VIRUS. AND FINALLY, WE FOCUS ON DEVELOPING SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS AND A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE. PRESIDENT TRUMP CLAIMS HE FOUND A CURE. YET WE HAVE 1000 PEOPLE DYING EACH DAY. MORE THAN 40,000 PEOPLE ARE IN HOSPITALS RIGHT NOW BATTLING THE VIRUS. LIFESAVING THERAPIES SHOULDN'T JUST BE AVAILABLE TO THE WEALTHY AND WELL-CONNECTED. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY, AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE BECAUSE LEARN ANY DAY THAT ONE OF THESE VACCINES CURRENTLY IN TRIAL IS SHOWING ITSELF TO BE EFFECTIVE. THAT WILL BE A WONDERFUL DAY FOR OUR PEOPLE, AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD EVERYWHERE, WHETHER IT COMES NEXT WEEK OR IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS. BUT IT WILL STILL BE MANY MONTHS BEFORE ANY VACCINE IS WIDELY AVAILABLE, AND WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAKING SURE IT GETS TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY IN A WAY THAT IS EQUITABLE AND THE COMFORTABLE. , EQUITABLE AND ACCOUNTABLE. AND WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO, IN THE MEANTIME, IS DOING HIS JOB TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ONCE WE HAVE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE, IT HAS TO BE FREE TO EVERYONE, WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE INSURED. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. THE VACCINE MUST BE FREE, AND FREELY AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. THIS IS NOT JUST ONE MORE REASON THAT IT IS SO DESPICABLE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS FIGHTING, IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, TO GET THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TO STRIKE DOWN THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH I WORK SO DAMN HARD TO GET THE VOTES FOR. UNDER THE VOTES FOR. UNDER THE ACA, INSURERS ARE REQUIRED TO COVER RECOMMENDED VACCINES FOR FREE. SO OVERTURNING THE ACA WOULD MEAN PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY TO GET THE COVID-19 VACCINE. THAT IS WRONG, VERY, VERY WRONG. UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, I BELIEVE HEALTH CARE ISN'T A PRIVILEGE. I THINK IT IS A RIGHT. THAT IS WHY, AS PRESIDENT I WILL BUILD ON AND PROTECT THE ACA BY ADDING A PUBLIC OPTION THAT WILL COMPETE WITH PRIVATE PLANS TO EXPAND COVERAGE AND LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS ACROSS THE BOARD. I WILL BRING DOWN RUG PRICES BY ALLOWING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE WITH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. I WILL MAKE SURE AMERICANS HAVE INSURANCE, AND THOSE WITH INSURANCE HAVE ACCESS TO FREE COVID-19 VACCINE. AND I WILL DIRECT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BULK PURCHASE AS MANY DOSES AS NECESSARY OF THE COVID-19 VACCINE, SO WE CAN PROVIDE IT FREE TO THOSE WHO ARE UNINSURED, UNDERINSURED, OR MEDICAID ELIGIBLE. THROUGHOUT ALL THIS, YES, MR. PRESIDENT, I WILL LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS. AND I WILL EMPOWER THEM. I KNOW HOW MUCH PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DAMAGED FAITH IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND IN OUR LEADERS IN GOVERNMENT , AND IN OUR LEADERS, AND GOVERNMENT ITSELF. WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE TRUST BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PUBLIC SERVANTS. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TASKS WE FACE IN THE COMING YEARS. IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL ALWAYS GIVE IT TO YOU, AS FDR SAID, STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER. I WILL DELIVER ON MY PROMISES. I WILL LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR POLITICS. I WILL LET DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS SPEAK FREELY, SO YOU CAN MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS POSSIBLE FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY. AND I WON'T LET FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP ROB US OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN QUALITIES, OUR HOPE IN THE FUTURE AND OUR FAITH IN OURSELVES. WE CAN BEAT THIS VIRUS. WE ARE NOT TO DIVIDED TO ACHIEVE BIG THINK , WE ARE NOT TOO DIVIDED TO ACHIEVE BIG THINGS. WE ARE AMERICANS. IMAGINE A TRUE, NATIONALLY-COORDINATED PLAN THAT SPARES NO EXPENSE SO THAT OUR SCHOOLS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO REOPEN WITH FULL HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS IN PLACE. IMAGINE EVERY SMALL BUSINESS GETTING A RESTART THAT HELPS COVER THE COST OF INSTALLING PLEXIGLASS, PPE, AND MINIMIZING THE RISK OF EXPOSURE TO CUSTOMERS AND WORKERS. IMAGINE OLDER AMERICANS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HAVING THE PEACE OF MIND THAT COMES WITH TRUSTING THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM IS WORKING FOR THEM. IMAGINE, INSTEAD OF STAYING LOCKED IN THEIR ROOMS, THEY ARE ABLE TO HUG THEIR GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS THAT THEY LOVE AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE. IMAGINE IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN HIT PARTICULARLY HARD, BLACK, LATINO, ASIAN AMERICAN, NATIVE AMERICAN, IMAGINE A PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RESPONSE THAT TREATS YOUR NEEDS AS A PRIORITY, NOT AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT. AND I JUNE 8 A IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE , AND IMAGINE A DAY IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE WHEN YOU CAN ENJOY A DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR FAMILY AND MAYBE GO TO A MOVIE, WHEN YOU CAN CELEBRATE YOUR BIRTHDAY, WEDDINGS, ACTUATIONS, SURROUNDED BY YOUR NEAREST AND DEAREST FRIENDS. THAT IS THE BIDEN-HARRIS AGENDA TO BEACH COVID-19. IT IS GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER, AND THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE, ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER, WATCHING OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO WEAR A MASK, AND PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING A Y LONGER. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. BUT IF WE FOLLOW THE SCIENCE AND KEEP FAITH IN ONE ANOTHER, WITH ONE ANOTHER, I PROMISE YOU WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS AND COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE MUCH FASTER THAN THE RATE WE ARE GOING NOW. YOU ALL KNOW THIS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN THEIR BEST TO THIS COUNTRY IN TIMES OF CRISIS, AND THIS TIME ISN'T ANY DIFFERENT. I'M NOT JOKING WHEN I SAY THIS, I THINK EVERY DAY ABOUT THE BRAVE DOCTORS AND NURSES AND HOSPITAL WORKERS, POLICE OFFICERS, FIREFIGHTERS, EMTS AND OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS. THEY ARE NOT FIGURATIVELY, BUT LITERALLY PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE DAY IN AND THEY OUT TO CARE FOR PEOPLE. I'M THINKING OF THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO CARRIED THE REST OF US ON THEIR SHOULDERS THROUGH THESE MANY MONTHS, GROCERY CLERKS, DELIVERY CLERKS, DRIVERS, FOLKS ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE, THE MEATPACKERS AND SO MANY MORE PEOPLE TOO OFTEN OVERLOOKED, TOO OFTEN OVERLOOKED, UNDER COMPENSATED, HAVE GIVEN THE BEST OF THEIR COUNTRY , HAVE GIVEN THE BEST TO THEIR COUNTRY WHEN WE NEEDED IT THE MOST. THINK OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO MOVED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND KEEP THEIR BUSINESS IS OPEN, AND SADLY, OF ALL THOSE WHO COULDN'T BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET THE HELP THEY WERE PROMISED. I THINK OF THE PARENTS WORKING FROM HOME WITH ADDED MAN'S OF OVERSEEING THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION. I THINK ABOUT EDUCATORS WHO ARE SPENDING HOURS LEARNING HOW TO TEACH ONLINE. THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO, GIVING ABOVE AND BEYOND FOR THEIR STUDENTS. I THINK OF THE FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES WHO STEPPED UP, DONATING TO CHARITIES, DOING GROCERY RUNS FOR OLDER RELATIVES AND NEIGHBORS, FINDING NEW WAYS TO CONNECT AND SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER. THAT IS THE AMERICA THAT WE KNOW. THAT IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT IS WHO WE ARE. AND LIKE JOHN F. KENNEDY, WHEN HE COMMITTED TO TAKE US TO THE MOON, HE SAID, I REFUSED TO POSTPONE THE POSSIBILITIES THAT EXIST FOR THIS COUNTRY. I REFUSE TO POSTPONE THE AMERICAN PURPOSE THAT WILL NOT ONLY LEAD OUR COUNTRY BACK, BUT LEAD THE ENTIRE WORLD. THERE IS NO CHALLENGE, THERE IS NO CHALLENGE WE CANNOT MEET, NO ENEMY WE ARE UNABLE TO FACE, NO THREAT WE CAN'T CONQUER IF WE STAND TOGETHER, UNITED, BOUND BY OUR COMMON RESOLVE, DETERMINATION AND VALUES. FOLKS, TOGETHER WE CAN HARNESS THE UNLIMITED POTENTIAL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NOT JUST TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE THIS VIRUS, BUT TO GET BACK BETTER. I PROMISE YOU, AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR HEART, WE CAN DO THIS. WE MUST DO THIS. AND WE WILL DO IT TOGETHER. YOU KNOW WE CAN DO IT. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR FRONT-LINE WORKERS AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE. THANK YOU, AND KEEP THE FAITH.",

         "Thank you very much. Thank you. Before I begin, I want to apprise everyone of an incident in the Strait of Hormuz today involving USS Boxer, a Navy amphibious assault ship. The Boxer took defensive action against an Iranian drone, which had closed into a very, very near distance, approximately 1,000 yards, ignoring multiple calls to stand down and was threatening the safety of the ship and the ship's crew. The drone was immediately destroyed. This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters. The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, our facilities, and interests, and calls upon all nations to condemn Iran's attempts to disrupt freedom of navigation and global commerce. I also call on other nations to protect their ships as they go through the Strait, and to work with us in the future. Thank you very much. I thought you should you know that. I'm honored to be here with Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands , fantastic country; incredibly successful country , and so many of our Dutch friends who have come with Mark. I want to thank you all for being with us in the East Room of the White House. Thank you all for being here. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you also to Vice President Pence and Acting Secretary of Defense Richard Spencer for joining us. Thank you, Richard, Mike. Last month, Melania and I traveled to the United Kingdom and France to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of D-Day. Together, we paid tribute to every courageous patriot who fought to liberate Europe from the evil of Nazi rule. Today, on behalf of the American people, I will receive an American flag that flew aboard a ship carrying the first waves of United States service members to land in Normandy. Seventy-five years after that momentous day , and that is truly a momentous day; one of the most powerful, most important days in the history of our world , it is my honor to welcome this great American flag back home where it belongs. I want to thank the Prime Minister, as well as U.S. Ambassador Peter Hoekstra. Pete, thank you. Thank you very much, Peter. You're doing a great job. And Dutch Ambassador Hendrik Schuwer, for being here today and for their devoted efforts to deepen the abiding ties between the United States and the Netherlands. Our relationship has never been closer than it is today. We are also profoundly moved to be joined by several incredible World War Two veterans who helped defeat the Nazis and save freedom for all humanity. With us is Jack Goldstein, who served in Europe during the war. Jack? Where's Jack? (Applause.) Thank you, Jack. Thank you. Thank you very much, Jack. Along with Steven Melnikoff and Harold Angle, both veterans of the Normandy campaign. (Applause.) Thank you very much, fellas. And they went on to fight in the Netherlands. Thank you, fellas. That's incredible. Thank you all three. You look great. Young guys. (Laughter.) Thank you very much. This event would not be possible without the extraordinary generosity of the flag's two donors from the Netherlands: Mr. Bert Kreuk, and his uncle and business partner, Mr. Theo Schols. And I want to thank you very much. Where are they? Thank you very much. That's great. (Applause.) Very much, thank you.And thank you for preserving our history and for watching over the immortal legacy of our D-Day heroes. That's what you did. Thank you. And I know it was expensive. Two rich people, I assume, right? (Laughter.) Huh? I appreciate it. Thank you. On June 6, 1944, the flag we receive today flew aboard Landing Craft Control 60. And it was approached, and when it approached Utah Beach , I was there very recently with the First Lady, and it was something incredible to see. Commanding the ship was a young Navy lieutenant, two days shy of his 27th birthday, named Howard Vander Beek. Amid treacherous German minefields, raging winds, and rough seas, Lieutenant Vander Beek and his crew led an astonishing 19 waves of American troops and equipment to those very, very dangerous beaches. Through it all, this flag soared proudly above the waters of the English Channel, announcing the arrival of our American warriors. After completing his mission on D-Day, Lieutenant Vander Beek took the flag , now bearing the scars of German machinegun fire and stained, all over it, with dirt and diesel and blood. He carried it with him in his backpack for the remainder of the war and kept the flag until his death in 2014. Soon after, the flag was purchased at auction by Mr. Kreuk and Mr. Schols, whose relatives were among the hundreds of Dutch who perished in the German bombings of Rotterdam in 1940. These two gentlemen paid half a million dollars to obtain the flag, just so they could return it as a gift to the American people and to the United States of America. As they explained, they wanted to thank the United States for the extraordinary sacrifice our service members made to liberate their nation and all of Europe in World War Two. So nice. Thank you very much. So nice. Thousands of Americans gave their lives on D-Day, and many thousands more gave their lives to drive the Nazis from the Netherlands. Following today's ceremony, the extraordinary flag will be displayed at the Smithsonian's Museum of American History , and very proudly. With us this afternoon are Secretary of the Smithsonian, a friend of mine, Lonnie Bunch. Lonnie, thank you very much for being here. (Applause.) And Director of the Museum of American History, Anthea Hartig. Anthea, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. And I know they will take great care of this priceless American artifact. Thank you very much for being here, both. I know they share Mr. Kreuk's vision for the flag. As he said, it will tell visitors from around the world about the story of freedom. With their help, this wonderful flag will be preserved forever and ever in American history, as it should be. It will always be a reminder of the supreme sacrifice of our warriors, and the beautiful friendship between the Dutch and the American people. And now, I would like to introduce a very special man, a man I've gotten to know very well during our strong negotiations on trade and our negotiations on the military and NATO and all of the other things we've been talking about for so long, it seems like right now. A Prime Minister who is very, very popular in his country. A great gentleman. And you're going to say a few words, and then Mr. Kreuk and Secretary Bunch will tell us more about the treasured gift that they presented us with. So I want to thank you all, and God bless America.

         "THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. PLEASE, CAN WE GIVE IT UP FOR ONE OF THE GREAT LEADERS OF IOWA AND AMERICA. YOU WEAR SO MANY HATS. YOU WEAR SO MANY HATS. AND YOU DESERVE A VOICE FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. SIME HONORED TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. CONFLUENCE BREWERY, THANKS FOR TAKING US IN. THAT'S THE LAST MINUTE AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE AND YOU JUST , YOU SHIFTED THE PLAN AND YOU CAME HERE. I CAN'T THANK CONFLUENCE BREWERY AND ALL OF YOU ON A RAINY AFTERNOON FOR BEING HERE. I'M VERY, VERY TOUCHED. THANK YOU. I'M KAMALA HARRIS, I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND SO I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF MY THOUGHTS AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO TAKING QUESTIONS. AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD ME SAY BEFORE, I FULLY INTEND TO WIN THIS ELECTION. I REALLY DO. PART OF THE MEASURE OF OUR SUCCESS IS GOING TO BE AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS THAT WE ARE RELEVANT. AND IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I AND WE LISTEN AS MUCH AS I TALK, ESPECIALLY AT THIS STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN, SO I AM HERE TO LISTEN AS MUCH AS I AM TO TALK BUT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS. FIRST OF ALL, CAN WE GET A BIG SHOUT OUT FOR NARAL. YAY. THERE WE ARE. SO I THANK YOU FOR COHOSTING THIS MEET AND GREET AND I WANT TO THANK THE LEADERS OF NARAL, MOST OF WHOM ARE VOLUNTEERS FOR THE WORK THEY DO AND YOU DO EVERY DAY. WE ALL KNOW THIS IS A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. IT IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US EACH TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK A QUESTION, THAT QUESTION BEING, WHO ARE WE? WE ALL KNOW PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES UPON WHICH WE BASE THAT PERSPECTIVE IS THAT RIGHT NOW, AND IT IS NOT A NEW MOMENT IN AMERICA, BUT IT IS A HIGHLIGHTED MOMENT. WOMEN'S ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IS UNDER ATTACK IN AMERICA. AND WE HAVE GOT TO STAND FIRM. WE HAVE GOT TO STAND FIRM. JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, I WAS IN ALABAMA, YOU ALL KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING AND IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN GEORGIA AND MISSOURI. WE ARE NOT BEING ALARMISTS WHEN WE SAY WOMEN WILL DIE. AND IN PARTICULAR, POOR WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR. THOSE WHO CANNOT LEAVE WHERE THEY ARE, WHICH IS IN A PLACE WHERE POLITICIANS HAVE DECIDED TO TELL WOMEN WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR OWN BODIES. THEY CANNOT LEAVE WHERE THEY ARE IN A PLACE WHERE POLITICIANS HAVE DECIDED THEY KNOW BETTER ABOUT WHAT A WOMAN NEEDS THAN HER OWN PHYSICIAN, AND WE ARE AT A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US TO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE WOMEN ARE GOING TO NEED OUR SUPPORT AND OUR HELP AND THEIR FAMILIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE A RIGHT OF COURSE, TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR LIVES, AND SO MANY OF THEM WILL NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE STATE IN WHICH THEY LIVE. NARAL, YOU'RE DOING THAT WORK OF SUPPORTING THESE WOMEN AND HELPING THEM IN THOSE PLACES AND BEING LEADERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN IS UNDER ATTACK. MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW, MY SISTER AND I , SHE IS HERE SOMEWHERE. THERE SHE IS. BUT YOU KNOW, I GREW UP, WE GREW UP HEARING ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES. OUR MOTHER WAS A BREAST CANCER RESEARCHER. SHE WAS A SCIENTIST. MY EARLIEST MEMORIES, SHE WOULD COME HOME ENRAGED OFTEN ABOUT THE LACK OF DIGNITY THAT WOMEN WERE GIVEN IN THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THE CONTEXT OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, IN THE CONTEXT OF TAKING WOMEN SERIOUSLY AND AT THEIR WORD WHEN THEY INDICATE OR EXPRESS WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. SO THIS ISSUE IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR TO ME. IT IS AN ISSUE THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT NOT ONLY REPRESENTS WHAT IS RIGHT IN TERMS OF GIVING A WOMAN HER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND TO EXERCISING FREE WILL AND EXERCISING AGENCY, IT IS NOT ONLY AN ISSUE THAT IS ABOUT THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF WOMEN AND THAT WOMEN MAY ACTUALLY DIE. IT IS ALSO AN ISSUE ABOUT UNDERSTANDING EQUALITY, FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF EQUALITY. MANY OF YOU WATCHED THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS. YOU REMEMBER WHEN I ASKED THAT QUESTION, IS THERE ANY LAW THAT YOU CAN THINK OF THAT TELLS A MAN WHAT TO DO WITH HIS BODY AND YOU COULD SEE PEOPLE GOING TO ALL KINDS OF INTERESTING PLACES WITH THAT, RIGHT? NO, IT IS ABOUT EQUALITY. IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF EQUALITY. SO I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ON THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY, PART OF WHAT I AM PREPARED TO DO IS NOT ONLY CONTINUE ENJOYING WITH ALL OF OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THIS FIGHT FOR FULL REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM FOR WOMEN, BUT I WILL ALSO TELL YOU AFTER ELECTED, I AM PREPARED TO REQUIRE THAT AS IT RELATES TO ANY STATE THAT HAS A HISTORY OF RESTRICTING A WOMAN'S ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE, THAT THAT STATE HAS TO CLEAR THAT LAW, TO CLEAR IT FOR CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER, TO CLEAR THAT IT COMPORTS WITH ROE V. WADE THROUGH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THAT IS CALLED PRECLEARANCE. AND UNTIL THAT LAW CLEARS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER, IT CANNOT GO INTO EFFECT. BECAUSE CLEARLY, WE NEED SOME OVERSIGHT, CONSTITUTIONAL OVERSIGHT, SO WE WILL PLAY ON THE DEFENSE, BUT LET'S ALSO TAKE IT ON THE OFFENSE. THIS ISSUE IS ONE OF THE MANY ISSUES THAT FOR ME, IT RELATES TO THE ISSUES PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT FROM THE TIME OF MY BIRTH. OUR PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE STUDENTS IN THE 1960'S WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. WE JOKE THAT WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WHO SPENT FULL TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING ABOUT THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE AND THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY. THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, FOR JUSTICE, FOR EQUALITY, IS A FIGHT THAT MUST BE FOUGHT AND WON WITH EACH GENERATION. RIGHT? I THINK THERE WERE TWO POINTS THERE. ONE, THAT IT IS THE VERY NATURE OF THIS FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY, THAT WHATEVER GAINS WE MAKE, THEY WILL NOT BE PERMANENT. IT IS THE NATURE OF IT. THE SECOND PART OF IT IS, , POINT THEN IS, KNOWING IT IS THE NATURE OF IT, DO NOT DESPAIR. DO NOT BE OVERWHELMED, LET'S NOT THROW UP OUR HANDS WHEN IT'S TIME TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES, RIGHT? SO ON THIS FIGHT FOR WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WE GET TO WORK AND DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THE DEFENSE AND THE OFFENSE, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER ISSUES RIGHT NOW AT PLAY AS WELL. I WILL TELL YOU, THAT SAME MOTHER OF OURS, SHE WAS FIVE FEET TALL, BUT YOU COULD SAY SHE WAS SEVEN FEET TALL. SHE WAS FIERCE. SHE WAS THE KIND OF PARENT WHO IF YOU EVER CAME HOME COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING, OUR MOTHER WOULD LOOK AT YOU WITH A HAND ON HER HIP AND WITH A VERY STRAIGHT FACE ASKED, 'WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?' SO, I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THERE YOU GO. AND LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS AT PLAY RIGHT NOW. WE'VE GOT THIS GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE, CURRENTLY. OK? HE TALKS ABOUT HOW HE'S GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT HE HAS ACTUALLY BETRAYED AMERICA. HE RAN ON A PLATFORM THAT SAID I AM GOING TO TAKE CARE OF Y'ALL. I DON'T NEED TO TELL IOWA THAT THIS SO-CALLED TRADE POLICY , TRADE BY TWEET , HAS RESULTED IN IOWA FARMERS, SOME OF WHOM ARE LOOKING AT BANKRUPTCY, THOSE WHO HAD CULTIVATED A MARKET OVER AT LEAST THE LAST DECADE IN CHINA TO SELL SOYBEANS, NOW SITTING ROTTING IN BINS. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU HOW HE BETRAYED PEOPLE WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT AS MANY AS 700,000 AUTOWORKERS IN THE UNITED STATES MAY LOSE THEIR JOB BY THE INDUSTRY YEAR. , BY THE END OF THE YEAR. LET'S TALK ABOUT BETRAYAL OF THE AMERICAN FAMILIES WITH THE SO-CALLED TRUMP TRADE POLICY, WHICH I CALL THE TRUMP TRADE TAX, AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE SPENDING 1.4 BILLION DOLLARS A MONTH MORE FOR EVERYTHING FROM SHAMPOOS TO WASHING MACHINES. IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. HE WANTS TO TAKE AMERICA BACKWARD, AND WE ARE PREPARED TO TURN THE PAGE. WE ARE PREPARED TO TURN THE PAGE. AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR, I'M HERE TO TEACH YOU ABOUT PART OF MY BACKGROUND , I HAVE A BACKGROUND WHERE SUCCESSFULLY, I HAVE PROSECUTED THE BIG BANKS WHO PREYED ON HOMEOWNERS, PROSECUTED PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WHO PREYED ON SENIORS, PROSECUTED TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT PREYED ON WOMEN AND CHILDREN, AND I WILL TELL YOU, WE HAVE A PREDATOR LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THE THING ABOUT THIS PERSON, IS HE'S GOT PREDATORY INSTINCTS AND A PREDATORY NATURE. BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU A SECRET ABOUT PREDATORS. THEY PREY ON THE VULNERABLE. THEY PREY ON THOSE WHO THEY ASSUME ARE WEAK. THEY PREY ON THOSE THEY ASSUME ARE DESPERATE. THE THING ABOUT PREDATORS IS THIS , THEY ARE COWARDS. WHAT WE NEED AND WANT IN OUR AMERICA IS A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO RECOGNIZES THAT HER STRENGTH DERIVES FROM AN ABILITY NOT TO BEAT PEOPLE DOWN, BUT LIFT PEOPLE UP. LIFT THEM UP. LOOK AT THE RAP SHEET ON THIS CASE. LET'S LOOK AT THE RAP SHEET, SHALL WE? SO, LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS THAT PROMISED WORKING PEOPLE THAT THEY WOULD BE HELPED, BUT THEN HE PASSES A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS. YOU LOOK AT THE TRUMP TRADE TAX AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF YET AGAIN CONTINUOUS ATTEMPTS TO TAKE HEALTH CARE FROM AMERICAN FAMILIES, INCLUDING REVIVING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AS A BAN ON GETTING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE CHILDREN IN CAGES AND THEY ARE SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS IN THE NAME OF ORDER SECURITY, WHEN IN FACT THAT IS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BEING COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. THERE IS PLENTY OF EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE THIS CASE, BUT LET'S ALSO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHAT IS BEFORE US IS NOT ONLY ABOUT THE, IT IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY, IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND FIGHTING FOR THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. TOMORROW, WE WILL CELEBRATE OUR NATION'S INDEPENDENCE. TOMORROW, WE WILL REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT WE ARE A NATION WHO DERIVES ITS GREATEST STRENGTH FROM THE FACT THAT BY OUR VERY NATURE, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS. THE IDEALS THAT WERE PRESENT WHEN WE WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THOSE WORDS WE , THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY , WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR-EYED. WE HAVE NOT YET REACHED THOSE IDEALS, BUT THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE IS WE FIGHT TO GET THERE, AND SO, FIGHT WE WILL AND FIGHT WE MUST, AND LET US BE CLEAR , THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF OPTIMISM. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF SEEING AND KNOWING WHAT CAN BE, AND BELIEVING IN THAT, UNBURNED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN NOT ONLY OF KNOWING WE MUST FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, BUT A FIGHT BORN OUT OF LOVE YOUR , LOVE OF COUNTRY, AND THIS IS A FIGHT, THEREFORE, FOR OUR AMERICA AND THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WORKING PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HOW THEY WILL PAY THEIR BILLS. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE YOU ONLY HAVE TO WORK ONE JOB TO HAVE A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE TEACHERS ARE PAID THEIR VALUE. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE WOMEN ARE PAID THE SAME AS MEN. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE WOMEN WILL ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE NO CHILD HAS TO ATTEND A HEARING TO DETERMINE IF THEY CAN HIDE IN A CLOSET BECAUSE OF A GUNMAN ROAMING THE HALLS OF THEIR SCHOOLS. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE EVERYONE IS GIVEN DIGNITY AND IS TREATED WITH EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS, AND THAT IS WHY WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT, AND AS WE MARCH TOWARD THE SELECTION IN , THIS ELECTION IN 2020, WITH AND BORN OUT OF AN ULTIMATE AND FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND THAT WE ALL RISE AND FALL TOGETHER AND THAT THE POWER IS IN THE PEOPLE, WITH ALL THAT IN OUR HEARTS AND OUR SOULS, I PROMISE YOU, DES MOINES, WE WILL WIN THIS ELECTION.",

         "So, we're going to Michigan, where we have tremendous economic activity. The governor should open up the state, open up the schools, play Big 10 football; we want them to do that. Big 10 is looking very strongly at opening up their season, but we're not getting any cooperation from the governor of Michigan. We have , we need some cooperation also from North Carolina, the governor of North Carolina. Tremendous economic activity; auto plants opening up, auto plants being expanded. Michigan is doing really well. They had the best year in their history last year. And when the plague came in, we had to shut it down and then open it up. But the problem with a few states is governors , Democrat governors all , are not opening up, and they have to open up. So we look forward to a good time. I hear we have a big crowd, like we had in Pennsylvania, frankly, and North Carolina and everywhere we go , New Hampshire. We're having very big crowds. And we're going to have a big crowd. I understand a very big one in Michigan when we land; we're doing it at the hangars in the airport. So we'll see you there. Anybody have any questions?",

         "WOW. MAN, THIS IS A BIG PLACE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. HE'S DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. THANK YOU TO THE GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA. LESS THAN ONE YEAR FROM NOW, I WILL JOIN VOTERS ACROSS THE SUNSHINE STATE, MY HOME. AS WE HEAD TO THE POLLS, AND TOGETHER, WE WILL WIN BACK THE HOUSE. WE WILL HOLD THE SENATE. WE WILL KEEP THAT BEAUTIFUL WHITE HOUSE. WE WILL KEEP IT. WE JUST HAD ANOTHER STOCK YOU SAW THAT. THE STOCK MARKET JUST HIT ANOTHER ALL-TIME IN HISTORY HIGH MEANING 401'S AND JOBS. EVERYONE IS GETTING RICH. AND I'M WORKING MY ASS OFF, THAT I CAN TELL YOU. BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE ARENA, MAKE SURE THAT YOU REGISTER TO VOTE. WE CAN'T TAKE ANY CHANCES. WE HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR. WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH RON. REGISTER TO VOTE. AS WE GATHER TOGETHER FOR THANKSGIVING SOME PEOPLE WANT THEY DON'T WANT TO USE THE TERM THANKSGIVING. EVERYBODY IS USING CHRISTMAS AGAIN. REMEMBER, I SAID THAT? NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A LITTLE WORK ON THANKSGIVING. PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS ON WHY IT SHOULDN'T BE CALLED THANKSGIVING. EVERYBODY HERE LOVES THE NAME THANKSGIVING AND WE'RE NOT CHANGING IT. AMERICANS HAVE SO MUCH TO BE THANKFUL FOR. THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING, WAGES ARE RISING, CRIME IS FALLING, AND AMERICA IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. WE'VE CREATED 6.7 MILLION NEW JOBS, INCLUDING 600,000 JOBS RIGHT HERE IN THE GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA. WE'RE PROTECTING AMERICAN WORKERS, TAKING CARE OF OUR AMAZING VETERANS. YOU KNOW, THE VETERANS, FOR YEARS, I WAS A CIVILIAN, I LOVED MY LIFE. IT WAS SO MUCH SIMPLER. IT WAS SO NICE AND SOFT AND EASY. YOU BUILD A BUILDING AND HAVE FUN. I WOULD ALWAYS SEE THAT YOU TURN ON THE NEWS AND READ IN THE PAPER ABOUT OUR VETERANS BEING MISTREATED. THEY WERE DOING SUCH A POOR JOB. YOU DON'T HEAR THAT ANYMORE. OUT VETERANS, FOR THE FIRST TIME, ARE TAKEN CARE OF TO A LEVEL THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY BEFORE. MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY RIGHT NOW WITH THE WORLD THE WAY IT IS WE ARE REBUILDING THE AWESOME POWER OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. $2.5 TRILLION AND EVERYTHING IS MADE IN THE GREAT U.S. OF A. A FEW WEEKS AGO, U.S. SPECIAL FORCES BROUGHT THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST TO JUSTICE. THE BLOODTHIRSTY SAVAGE KNOWN AS AL-BAGHDADI IS DEAD, FINALLY. JUST THIS WEEK, I STUCK UP FOR THREE GREAT WARRIORS AGAINST THE DEEP STATE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I HAD SO MANY PEOPLE SAY, SIR, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD DO THAT. PEOPLE HAVE TO FIGHT. THEY SHOULDN'T SAY, GEE WHIZ. THEY WANTED TO PUT HIM IN JAIL FOR 25 YEARS. ONE YOUNG MAN WAS IN JAIL FOR 7 YEARS. HE HAD 16 YEARS TO GO. I WANT TO TELL YOU, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY DID TO THAT MAN, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY PROUD AT WHAT WE ENDED UP DOING. HE CAME OUT AND HE HUGGED HIS PARENTS. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL THING. I WILL ALWAYS STICK UP FOR OUR GREAT FIGHTERS. PEOPLE CAN SIT IN AIR-CONDITIONED OFFICES AND COMPLAIN, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME. THEY'RE OUT OF THAT FIELD, AND THEY ARE DOING A JOB FOR US LIKE NOBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD CAN DO. THE FACT IS, AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN. AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN. SO WHILE WE'RE CREATING JOBS AND KILLING TERRORISTS AND TAKING CARE OF OUR BORDERS. WE'RE SETTING RECORDS. THE WALL IS HAPPENING. IT'S GETTING BILLED RAPIDLY AND THAT'S A REAL WALL. THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO RIP OUR NATION APART. FIRST, IT WAS THE RUSSIA HOAX. TOTAL HOAX. IT WAS A FAILED OVERTHROW ATTEMPT AND THE BIGGEST FRAUD IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THEN THE MUELLER DEAL. YOU REMEMBER THAT MESS. THEY HAD NOTHING. TWO YEARS. THEY SPENT $45 MILLION AND THE REAL COST IS MANY TIMES THAT NUMBER. NOW THE SAME MANIACS ARE PUSHING THE DERANGED IMPEACHMENT. THINK OF THIS. IMPEACHMENT. A WITCH HUNT. THE SAME AS BEFORE. THEY'RE PUSHING THAT IMPEACHMENT WITCH HUNT. A LOT OF BAD THINGS ARE HAPPENING TO THEM. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE POLLS? EVERYBODY SAID, THAT'S REALLY BULLSHIT. EVERYBODY. A LOT OF FAKE NEWS OUT THERE. THEY'RE GONNA SAY THE PRESIDENT CAME. THEY WILL NEVER TALK ABOUT THE CROWD. ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS YESTERDAY HAD A RALLY. TWO PEOPLE SHOWED UP, TWO. TWO PEOPLE! THEY GIVE US NO CREDIT. IF SOME BUT HE HAS A RALLY LIKE 1000 PEOPLE, THEY'LL SAY, IT WAS PACKED. THEY HAD A THOUSAND PEOPLE. IF WE HAVE A RALLY WITH 50,000 PEOPLE, THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS, BUT YOU GO OUTSIDE, THERE ARE A LOT OUTSIDE THAT CAN'T GET IN. THE LIES OF THE DEMOCRATS ARE BEING EXPOSED. THEIR SCHEMES ARE UNRAVELING. THEIR CRIMES, AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS, CRIMES. DID YOU EVER HEAR THIS GUY, SCHIFF? HE MADE UP MY STATEMENT TO THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT. HE MADE IT UP. THESE ARE CROOKED PEOPLE. THESE CRIMES ARE BEING REVEALED AND THEIR SINISTER PLANS ARE BEING UNVEILED AT A LEVEL THAT NOBODY THOUGHT, EVEN ME, POSSIBLE. THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO OVERTURN THE LAST ELECTION BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CANNOT WIN THE NEXT ELECTION. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. YOU KNOW, WHEN I STARTED THIS WHEN I STARTED THIS, I SAID, WE'RE GONNA DO THIS AND THAT, AND IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING. JUST ANOTHER GUY TRYING TO GET ELECTED. IT'S TOUGH. IT'S NOT EASY. WHEN A GUY GOES OUT AND NOBODY SHOWS IT'S NOT EASY. IT'S NORMAL. THIS IS NOT NORMAL. YOU THINK THIS IS NORMAL? CAN I BE HONEST, IN FRONT OF THOSE FAKERS BACK THERE, SOME OF THE MOST CORRUPT PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. I WILL TELL YOU IN FRONT OF THESE GUYS, AND THEY'RE FAKE, THEY'RE CORRUPT. IN FRONT OF THE MEDIA, THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. WE NEVER HAVE AN EMPTY SEAT. I SAY, LET'S GO TO FLORIDA, JUST GET ME THE BIGGEST ARENA. LET'S GO TO WISCONSIN, LET'S GO TO MICHIGAN, LET'S GO TO PENNSYLVANIA, NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, MICHIGAN ANYWHERE. AND ALL I SAY IS, IT DOESN'T MATTER, JUST GET ME THE BIGGEST ARENA. WE GET THESE MASSIVE ARENAS LIKE THIS ONE AND THEY'RE PACKED. WE PUT THE SCREENS OUTSIDE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE. THERE IS SOMETHING HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY LIKE HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE. IN THE TWISTED WORLDVIEW OF THE WASHINGTON VERY SICK DEMOCRATS, IT WAS TOTALLY FINE WHEN HILLARY CLINTON RAN HER OUTRAGEOUS PAY FOR PLAY SCHEME OUT OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT. THEN SHE DELETED 33,000 EMAILS AFTER RECEIVING THE SUBPOENA FROM CONGRESS. THAT WAS STANDARD PLAY. WHEN I HAVE A PERFECT PHONE CALL IT'S A PERFECT CALL. THERE WAS A WOMAN BEING INTERVIEWED. THEY WERE TALKING TO WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP. NO, THEY WERE TRYING TO FIND ONE OF THOSE GRADE B NETWORKS. THEY COULDN'T FIND THEY GOT THESE 10 WOMEN. THEY WERE ALL FOR TRUMP. THEY ALL SAID I VOTED FOR TRUMP BUT I WON'T DO IT AGAIN. THEY SAID, WHO IS VOTING FOR TRUMP? 10 HANDS. IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT'S HAPPENING. THEY ACTUALLY SAID, AND I SHOULDN'T SAY THIS BECAUSE THEY WILL BRING IT UP, WE HAVE THE GREATEST BASE IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS. YOU'RE THE SMARTEST. THEY DON'T LIKE TO SAY THAT. I WENT TO GREAT COLLEGES, YOU WENT TO GREAT SCHOOLS OR COLLEGES. YOU PEOPLE ARE SUCCESSFUL AS HELL. THEY LIKE TO TRY TO DEMEAN. WE'RE WINNING, YOU'RE SMARTER, YOU'RE BETTER LOOKING, YOU'RE SHARPER. THEY CALL THEMSELVES ELITE. IF THEY'RE ELITE, THEN WE'RE THE SUPER ELITE. IT'S TRUE. THEY TALK ABOUT THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE ELITE THAT ARE RUNNING. HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING THESE DEBATES? WHAT'S ELITE ABOUT THAT? THERE'S NOTHING ELITE. WE'RE DOING GREAT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS VICTORY. WHEN I HAVE A PERFECT CALL THINK OF IT, WHAT THEY GET AWAY WITH. FORGET.AND AND WITH NO DON'T FORGET. I CAME TO WASHINGTON HAVING BEEN HERE ONLY A FEW TIMES. I'M WRITING IN WASHINGTON AND I SAY TO THE FIRST LADY, WHO IS DOING A FANTASTIC JOB, I THINK I MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN WASHINGTON 17 TIMES IN MY LIFE, AND I'M LOOKING AT THE FIRST LADY AND I SAY, MELANIA, DO YOU BELIEVE IT? I'M PRESIDENT. ? CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? AND I NEVER SAW SO MANY MOTORCYCLES AND I NEVER SAW SO MANY POLICE CARS AND WE ARE GOING SO FAST IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO GO THAT WAY I SAY, THIS IS COOL, WE COULD GET USED TO THIS, THIS IS OK. I'M THINKING TO MYSELF WHEN I SAID THAT I SAID, LOOK, SO I GET ELECTED, AND I BEAT THE BUSH DYNASTY. I GET ELECTED AND I BE WITH NO EXPERIENCE, I HAVE TREMENDOUS WORLD EXPERIENCE, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE POLITICAL EXPERIENCE I GET ELECTED AND WE BEAT THE CLINTON DYNASTY, RIGHT? AND THEN WE BEAT BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA AND WHATEVER THE HELL DYNASTY THAT IS. WE HAVE 24 YEARS OF PEOPLE PUTTING PEOPLE IN OFFICE. WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. SOME OF THEM ARE VERY NICE, BUT I GET STUCK WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I DON'T WANT. TENS OF THOUSANDS. WE'RE GETTING IT RIGHT. WE HAVE A GREAT CABINET. WE ARE DOING THINGS THAT NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER DONE BEFORE. YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY HAPPY. WE HAVE DONE MORE ALREADY. HOPEFULLY, I WILL SAY THIS TO DRIVE THEM CRAZY, HOPEFULLY WE HAVE ANOTHER AT LEAST FIVE YEARS TO GO. AT LEAST. YOU KNOW, THEY THINK, HE'S NOT LEAVING, DON'T YOU? WE HAVE FIVE YEARS AND WE WILL MAKE IT A GREAT FIVE YEARS. WE HAVE DONE MUCH MORE THAN I PROMISED. IF YOU LOOK AT THE TAX CUTS AND THE MILITARY AND THE V.A. RIGHT TO TRY, HOW GOOD IS THAT? THINGS THAT FOR YEARS AND YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET PASSED. WHEN I HAVE A PERFECT PHONE CALL WITH ALL OF THE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE DONE, WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UKRAINE, THEY'VE TRIED TO CLAIM THAT IT'S AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE. ONE OF THE WOMEN SAID THIS MORNING, I'M VOTING FOR TRUMP. I HAPPENED TO READ THE TRANSCRIPT OF HIS PHONE CALL AND HE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG CAN YOU IMAGINE? THEY TAKE THIS PERFECT CALL AND THEY WANT TO IMPEACH YOUR PRESIDENT. HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS. WE HAVE MORE SUPPORT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, KEVIN MCCARTHY, MEADOWS, JIM JORDAN, THE GREAT CHAMPION WRESTLER. WE GOT A COUPLE OF THEM HERE. I'LL SAVE THEIR NAMES. STEVE SCALISE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. HOW'S ELISE DOING? NEW STAR. IT'S INCREDIBLE. DEVIN NUNES, HOW GOOD HAS HE BEEN? DEVIN. SO MANY MORE. I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT. A LOT OF STARS ARE BEING MADE. I WAS TOLD BACKSTAGE THAT OUR POLL NUMBERS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WATCHING A SCAM. THEY DON'T LIKE WATCHING IT. THEY HAVE A SICK PUPPY, SHIFTY SCHIFF. HE IS SICK. THEY DON'T LIKE SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENED. A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING ONE OF THEM WAS IN DETROIT, D, DEMOCRAT 30. THAT'S NOT ONE THAT WE WILL WORK TOO HARD TO GET BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. SHE CAME OUT AND SAID, I'M NOT HERE TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT. WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS, THEY DON'T LIKE THE POSITION THEY ARE IN. THEY ARE GOING TO LIKE IT LESS AND LESS AND WE WILL TAKE IT RIGHT TO NOVEMBER 3, 2020. WE'RE GONNA TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. SO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UKRAINE DECLARED THERE WAS NO PRESSURE PUT ON ME. HE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS. HE SAID IT ALL DIFFERENT WAYS. NO PRESSURE. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER STATED, AND I QUOTE, AMBASSADOR SONDLAND DID NOT TELL US, AND CERTAINLY DID NOT TELL ME, ABOUT A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ASSISTANCE AND THE INVESTIGATION. I HAVE NEVER HAD A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN INVESTIGATIONS AND SECURITY ASSISTANCE. WHAT THAT MEANS, IT MEANS, WE DID ZERO WE DID NOTHING WRONG. NOTHING. A GREAT SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN, RON JOHNSON. A SUPPORTER OF US FROM DAY ONE. OF THE UKRAINE, HE SAID, WHO MET PRIVATELY AND HE MET WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND HE SAID, AT NO TIME DURING THAT MEETING WAS THERE ANY MENTION BY THE PRESIDENT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT? AT NO TIME WAS THERE ANY MENTION OR ANYTHING THAT THEY WERE FEELING ANY PRESSURE IN RETURN FOR MILITARY AID. THEY WERE DEVASTATED BY WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS MUELLER WITCH HUNT DEAL. THEN MUELLER TESTIFIED. HOW DID HE DO? WASN'T TOO GOOD. THEY WERE DEVASTATED. THEY SAY, THIS WAS A DISASTER. NOW THEY SAY, GIVE US ANYTHING, WE'LL IMPEACH HIM. LET HIM GO TO THE REFRIGERATOR AND PICK AN ORANGE, FROM FLORIDA, NO LESS. WE'LL IMPEACH HIM. DURING THE TIME PERIOD AT ISSUE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HELD MANY MEETINGS WITH THE UKRAINE AND NEVER ONCE DID THE UKRAINE OR THE OFFICIAL SAY ANYTHING THAT WAS WRONG. ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M HEARING ABOUT A PHONE CALL. FORTUNATELY, THEY HAD TRANSCRIBERS. HOW ABOUT IF I DIDN'T WITH THESE LOWLIFES. ALL I'M SAYING, I DON'T WANT TO GO IN IT TOO LONG. IT'S A TERRIBLE HOAX. LAST WEEK, SONDLAND TESTIFIED THAT I TOLD HIM, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM THE UKRAINE? I SAID, I WANT NOTHING. NO QUID PRO QUO. I WANT NOTHING. TELL PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO DO THE RIGHT THING, TO DO WHAT HE RAN ON. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS. EVERYBODY. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HEARD SHIFTY MAKE UP A STORY WHERE HE MADE UP WHAT I SAID. THESE ARE THE FACTS. THE CASE CLOSED, GAME OVER. TURN OFF THE TELEVISION. AS SOON AS HE SAID THAT, IT WAS LIKE, TURN OFF THE TELEVISION. I HAVE HAD REPUBLICANS COME UP TO ME SAY, CAN WE KEEP THIS SUCKER GOING A LITTLE BIT LONGER? WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT AT THE POLLS. I SAID, LET'S GET IT OVER WITH BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE ARE STUCK DEALING WITH SICK AND CORRECTED CORRUPT PEOPLE. THE FAILED WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT IS TRYING TO STOP ME BECAUSE I'M FIGHTING FOR YOU AND BECAUSE WE'RE WINNING. VERY SIMPLE. THEY'RE ATTACKING ME BECAUSE I'M EXPOSING A RIGGED SYSTEM THAT ENRICHED ITSELF AT YOUR EXPENSE, AND I'M RESTORING GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE. IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT CORRUPTION LOOKS LIKE, THEN TAKE A LOOK NO FURTHER THAN SLOW, SLEEPY JOE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH JOE. WHEN SLEEPY JOE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE UKRAINIAN POLICY, HIS SON, I CALL HIM, WHERE IS HE? WHERE'S HUNTER? WHAT HAPPENED TO HUNTER? WHERE'S HUNTER? HIS SON RECEIVED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM A UKRAINIAN ENERGY COMPANY YOU KNOW THE REPUTATION OF THAT COMPANY, DESPITE KNOWING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT ENERGY. WHAT BUSINESS ARE YOU IN, SIR? THE MAILBOX BUSINESS? OH, BAIL BOND, WHOA. YOU KNOW HUNTER BIDEN? DO YOU KNOW SLEEPY JOE? BAIL BONDS. HMM. DID YOU EVER WORK ON ENERGY BEFORE? HE SAID NO. YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT ENERGY THAN HUNTER. DESPITE BEING THROWN OUT OF THE NAVY FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT REASONS, HE MADE NO MONEY, ZERO, NOTHING. ALL OF A SUDDEN, HIS FATHER BECOMES VICE PRESIDENT. HE'S MAKING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS, AND THEN HE GOES TO CHINA. WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO A GOOD DEAL. IF WE DON'T MAKE IT, THAT'S FINE, BUT WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE. HUNTER IS DEALING WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAN I AM IN CHINA. AFTER 10 MINUTES, HE WALKED AWAY WITH $1.5 MILLION. I SAID TO EVERYBODY, THESE ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAN I AM DEALING WITH IN CHINA. THEY'RE MUCH SOFTER. THAT WAS WHEN HIS FATHER WAS VICE PRESIDENT. CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? THE FAKE NEWS DOESN'T WANT TO BRING IT UP. THEY PROTECT EVERYBODY. THE DEMOCRATS ON STAGE DON'T BRING IT UP, DO YOU NOTICE? IF HE SHOULD MAKE IT, IT WILL BE BROUGHT UP 75% OF THE TIME WE ARE DEBATING. NOBODY EVER GOT AWAY WITH A SCAM LIKE THAT. NOBODY. DAY AFTER DAY, WE ARE EXPOSING THE DEPRAVITY, DISHONESTY, AND SICKNESS OF THE CORRUPT WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT. THEY ARE ROUGH AND DIRTY PLAYERS. THEY ARE COMING AT YOU FROM EVERY SIDE, COMING AT YOU FROM NEW YORK, COMING AT ME FROM NEW JERSEY, COMING AT ME FROM EVERY DEMOCRATIC STATE. RUSH LIMBAUGH SAID AND SEAN HANNITY THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW A MAN OR WOMAN IN THE WORLD THAT COULD TAKE THE CRAP THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. AND AT THE SAME TIME, BE A GREAT PRESIDENT. NOBODY, IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF A PRESIDENCY, HAS DONE WHAT WE'VE DONE, NOBODY. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. WITH YOUR HELP, WE'RE GOING TO COMPLETE THE MISSION. WE ARE DRAINING THE SWAMP. ON ELECTION DATE 2020, THE CRAZY DEMOCRATS ARE GOING DOWN IN A LANDSLIDE. THAT LANDSLIDE IS GOING TO START RIGHT HERE IN THE GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA. THANK YOU. HERE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST READ ABOUT. WE LIKE THESE UPDATED STORIES. DON'T WE LIKE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED A FEW DAYS AGO? EVERYBODY FALLS ASLEEP. NOBODY COMES. THEY SAY, HOW WAS HE? IT WAS SO BORING. IT WAS SO BORING. I ALWAYS SAY, BEING PRESIDENTIAL IS ALWAYS EASY. THANK YOU. IT IS SO EASY. DOING WHAT I DO IS TOUGH. IT'S NOT TOUGH FOR ME BECAUSE I LIKE IT. IF YOU DON'T LOVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING, FORGET ABOUT IT. I DO LIKE IT. WHAT WE ARE DOING TOGETHER HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. NEVER BEEN DONE. I LIKE TELLING THE STORIES THAT HAPPENED. THEY DON'T HAVE TO PUT THEM IN SPEECHES. HE READ STUFF AND PEOPLE FALL ASLEEP. ON SATURDAY, YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED. THE WHITE HOUSE PHYSICIAN CALLED ME AND SAID, I COULD DO SOME OF THE PHYSICAL. I NEVER TOOK PHYSICALS BEFORE. IT'S IMPORTANT. IT'S GOOD. JANUARY IS A VERY BUSY MONTH FOR YOU, SIR. YOU'RE RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? LET'S GO. WE GO TO WALTER REED MEDICAL CENTER. INCREDIBLE DOCTORS. I WAS THERE FOR JUST A SHORT WHILE. I VISITED A FAMILY OF A SOLDIER. INCREDIBLE FAMILY. THEIR SON WAS IN SERIOUS CONDITION. I STAYED WITH THEM FOR A LITTLE WHILE. I TOWARDS THE HOSPITAL. VERY SIMPLE. I TOOK A LITTLE PART OF MY PHYSICAL SO I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT IN JANUARY. I GOT BACK INTO THE MOTORCADE, THE CAR. WE HAVE MANY CARS AND TRUCKS AND AMBULANCES, UNFORTUNATELY. LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS. WE ALSO HAVE A BUS, WHATEVER CARRIES THESE CRAZY PEOPLE. THE PRESS FOLLOWS ME WHEREVER I GO, UNFORTUNATELY. IN THE OLD DAYS, I CAN SNEAK OUT AND GO SOMEPLACE. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. THE PRESS, EVERYBODY IS THERE. WE STARTED A BEAUTIFUL THING. LOTS OF CARS AND LOTS OF ACTION. THE PRESS IS FOLLOWING ME. I HADN'T EVEN GOTTEN BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT STUPID, CORRUPT, HORRIBLE CNN THEIR RATINGS ARE TERRIBLE, BY THE WAY. AND OTHERS, AND OTHERS, AND OTHERS. CNN'S RATINGS ARE TERRIBLE. LOOK, THEIR LIGHT JUST WENT OFF. THE LIGHT JUST WENT OFF. I SHOULDN'T DO IT. I SHOULDN'T DO IT. WE LOSE AUDIENCE WHEN THAT HAPPENS. THEY REPORTED SO HERE I AM. I'M THERE FOR A VERY ROUTINE, LITTLE, SIMPLE PHYSICAL. BY THE WAY, I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT. IF THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. IT'S VERY BIG STUFF. I WAS THERE TO SAVE A LITTLE TIME. I FEEL GREAT. LET ME TELL YOU, IF I DIDN'T FEEL GREAT, I WOULDN'T BE RANTING AND RAVING TO 22,000 PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE. SO I GET BACK IN AND NOW IT'S A SHORT DRIVE. WE ARRIVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I HEARD THAT THEY SAID, IT CAME OUT IN THE MEDIA, INCLUDING SOME OF THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE TONIGHT. IT'S LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS USED TO BE. YOU KNOW THE ACADEMY AWARDS? THEY WERE BIG UNTIL THEY HAVE STARTED HITTING US. NOW THEY HAVE GONE DOWN THE TUBES. LOOK AT ALL THOSE LIGHTS BACK THERE. BUT I'M GETTING OUT OF THE CAR AND SOMEBODY SAYS, ARE YOU OK? I SAID, WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? I GO A FEW FEET FURTHER AND ANOTHER SECURITY, SIR, ARE YOU OK? I SAID, YES, I'M FINE. WHAT'S WRONG? NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED ME THAT. THESE ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLE. THE MILITARY, THE SECRET SERVICE. THEY ARE THE GREATEST. BUT THEY DON'T EVER SAY, SIR, ARE YOU OK? I COULD SEE HE WAS TROUBLED. HE LIKES ME, YOU KNOW? I WALK ANOTHER FEW FEET, SIR, I HOPE YOU'RE OK. WHAT IS GOING ON? AND THEN THEY SAID I HAD A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK. NOTHING TO JOKE ABOUT. THEY SAID I HAD A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK. AND IT WASN'T TRUE. THEY KNEW WASN'T TRUE. SO WE HAD THE PEOPLE CALL. IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. THEY ARE TOTALLY CORRUPT PEOPLE. THEY SAID IT'S UNTRUE. THEY BROUGHT IT DOWN FROM A MASSIVE, UNBELIEVABLE HEART ATTACK IT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR THEM TO DO. THE WORLD BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE REST OF THE WORLD AND LEADERS LIKE AND RESPECT YOUR PRESIDENT. WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS. IT'S VERY SAD. INSTEAD, THEY BROUGHT IT DOWN A INSTEAD, THEY BROUGHT IT DOWN A NOTCH. THEY SAID, HE WENT INTO THE HOSPITAL. IT'S TRUE, I DIDN'T WEAR A TIE. WHY WOULD I WEAR A TIE? THE FIRST THING THEY DO IS TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT. SHOW US YOUR GORGEOUS CHEST. WE WANT TO SEE. WE'VE NEVER SEEN A TEST QUITE LIKE IT. SERIOUSLY, WHY WOULD I PUT ON A TIE? WE ARE THERE IN 20 MINUTES AND I TAKE IT OFF. IT'S A PHYSICAL. PEOPLE SAID, HE WASN'T WEARING A TIE WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR ME. MAYBE IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT. YOU NEVER APOLOGIZE. THEY SAID, HE WASN'T WEARING A TIE. IT'S A SIGN OF A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK. WE CALLED OFF AND OUR PEOPLE DID A GOOD JOB. SCREAMING, HERE HE'S FINE, NOTHING HAPPENED. THEY BROUGHT IT DOWN TO TREMENDOUS CHEST PAINS. HE HAD CHEST PAINS. ONE OF THEM SAID, THEY WERE TREMENDOUS. TREMENDOUS. THE ONLY ONE THAT DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ME. AND THEN THEY SAID, A LITTLE BIT LATER, HE IS STAYING OVER IN THE HOSPITAL. THEY KNEW I CAME BACK. THEY WERE WITH ME. THEY WERE WITH ME. THEY WERE WITH ME. THEY SAW ME GOT INTO THE CAR. THEY SAW STEVE. SAW US LEAVE. THEY SAID I STAYED AT THE GREAT WALTER REED HOSPITAL. SO, WE SAID, NO, THE CHEST PAINS AREN'T TRUE. THEY KEPT ON REPORTING IT. WE COULDN'T GET THEM TO STOP. THEY ARE CORRUPT, CROOKED. WE COULDN'T GET THEM TO STOP. THEY ARE CORRUPT, CROOKED. WE DON'T HAVE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. WE HAVE A VERY DISHONEST PRESS. ON MONDAY, I FLEW TO TEXAS. I OPENED UP AN APPLE COMPUTER PLANT. THEY MAKE THE NEW, BEAUTIFUL MAC THEY MAKE THE NEW, BEAUTIFUL MAC WHATEVER. I MET WITH TIM COOK AND DID LOTS OF WORK. IT'S A LONG FLIGHT. I GOT BACK MANY HOURS LATER, IT WAS LATE NIGHT. I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, I JUST SET A RECORD. YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE, THEY SAID I HAD A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK. NOW, A DAY LATER, I'M TRAVELING TO TEXAS TO OPEN UP THIS BIG PLANT. I DON'T KNOW. NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE EVER DONE THAT ONE BEFORE. SO, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU AS AN EXAMPLE, WE HAD A GREAT TWO WEEKS WATCHING THESE CROOKED POLITICIANS NOT GIVING US DUE PROCESS. NOT GIVING US LAWYERS. NOT GIVING US THE RIGHT TO SPEAK. AND DESTROYING THEIR WITNESSES. IT FELL APART. THOSE WERE THERE WITNESSES. WE WEREN'T ALLOWED ANY RIGHTS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, WE HAD NO RIGHTS. DESPITE THAT, WE WON. IF YOU READ THE CROOKED 'NEW YORK TIMES,' IF YOU READ 'THE WASHINGTON POST,' A HORRIBLE PAPER, WE DON'T HAVE IT ANYWHERE IN D.C. ANYMORE. WE DON'T DELIVER IT OR GIVE IT. WE USED TO BUY IT. I ENDED IT IN THE NATION. I WANT THEM TO GET CORRECT NEWS, NOT FAKE NEWS. BUT THERE BAD PEOPLES. SO WHAT HAPPENED BUT THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE. SO WHAT HAPPENED, WE KEEP WINNING, WE WON THESE LAST TWO WEEKS SO SOLIDLY. IF YOU PICK UP THE NEW YORK TIMES, THIS CRAZY WASHINGTON POSTPOST. THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS, THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE IT GO ON. IT PROBABLY WILL, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE NUTS. I REALLY THINK IT IS A GOOD THING FOR US AS A PARTY. IT WILL WALK US THROUGH THE CRAZY ELECTION, WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE ALREADY. WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED TONIGHT BY MANY TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN LEADERS. I WANT TO HAVE ONE UP ON THE STAGE, BUT THEY ARE STARS, WARRIORS LIKE THOSE THREE GUYS WE HELPED OUT, WARRIORS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR YOUR PRESIDENT AND YOUR COUNTRY. THEY LOVE THE STATE OF FLORIDA, CONGRESSMAN MATT GAETZ. THE MAN I JUST WATCHED LAST NIGHT ON TELEVISION. HE WAS FANTASTIC. HE WAS FANTASTIC. CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL LONG. BILLY POSEY, A GREAT GUY AND A GREAT FIGHTER. COME UP, BILLY. GUS BILIRAKIS. GUS, COME ON UP. AND A MAN WHO IS AN INCREDIBLY BRAVE GUY COME A FRIEND OF MINE, SOMEBODY WHO HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB AND LOVES THIS STATE. BRIAN MAST. I WANT TO INTRODUCE A FRIEND OF ALL OF OURS WHO RAN A FRIEND OF ALL OF OURS WHO RAN A GREAT CAMPAIGN, WON EASILY, DESPITE A LOT OF CROOKED STUFF GOING ON WITH THOSE VOTING MACHINES. TRUE. HE BETTER NOT BE MORE POPULAR IN FLORIDA THAN ME. HERE'S A QUICK ONE. HERE'S A QUICK STORY. I SHOULDN'T SAY IT. WHAT THE HELL? RON HAS BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME. HE WAS AN INCREDIBLE THEY WOULD HAVE TWO OR THREE JOBS. THAT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE. YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR JOB. IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU ARE DOING, IF YOU ARE NOT HAVING A GOOD TIME GETTING UP THE MORNING, ALL YOU DO IS FIND A NEW JOB. YOU WILL GET MORE MONEY, MOST LIKELY. YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SO SET. YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SUCCESSFUL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN RIGHT NOW. NEVER EVEN CLOSE. THE STATE HAS NEVER HAD THIS SUCCESS. YOU HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR. RICK SCOTT IS NOW YOUR SENATOR. HE'S FANTASTIC. MARCO RUBIO, A GREAT GUY. WE HAVE TWO GREAT GUYS. MARCO AND RICK. TWO GREAT GUYS. THEY LOVE THE STATE. THE MEDIAN INCOME UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH ROSE $400 OVER AN EIGHT YEAR TIME. THINK OF THIS. EIGHT YEARS, $400. UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA, IT ROSE $975. YOU HAVE 400, 8 YEARS. 975, 8 YEARS. UNDER TRUMP, IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS, IT ROSE $5,000. BUT THAT'S 5000, RIGHT? NOW YOU CAN ADD TO THE $5,000. TAX CUTS, REGULATORY CUTS, AND ENERGY SAVINGS. WE ARE THE NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD. WE CAN ADD ANOTHER $5,000. IT'S $400, $975, AND LESS THAN THREE YEARS, $10,000 MEDIAN INCOME. NOBODY'S GOING TO BEAT THAT. NOBODY'S GOING TO BE THAT. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT GOING. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS UNTAPPED POTENTIAL. WE ENDED THE LAST ADMINISTRATION'S WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY. THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO CLOSE IT UP. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WILL USE. LITTLE TINY WINDMILLS. THE BIG ONES KILLED TOO MANY BIRDS. WE ARE REVERSING DECADES OF RUINOUS TRADE POLICIES THAT DEMOLISHED ONE IN FOUR THE NUMBER IS NOW GREATER THAN THAT. FLORIDA MANUFACTURING JOBS, YOU WOULD NEED A MAGIC WAND. YOU WILL NEVER BRING IT BACK. YOU NEED A MAGIC WAND. AFTER THE TWIN DISASTERS OF NAFTA, ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS EVER MADE, AND CHINA'S ENTRANCE IN THE WTO, THE WTO. FOR YEARS, BOUGHT AND PAID FOR POLITICIANS TOOK MONEY FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS TO SHIP YOUR JOBS TO OTHER COUNTRIES. THEIR CAMPAIGN COFFERS GOT FULL. THE LIVES OF HARD-WORKING AMERICANS WERE DESTROYED. ALL THESE COMPANIES LEFT YOU WITH THE JOBS, THEY LEFT YOU WITH NOTHING. YOU ARE HAVING THE GREATEST YEAR IN FLORIDA. A DOCTOR, PLEASE. DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE, PLEASE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE YOU OK? YOU LOOK LIKE A TOUGH GUY TO ME, I'LL TELL YOU. THANK YOU. GET A LITTLE WATER OR SOMETHING. IN THE OLD DAYS, WE USED TO SHARE WATER. TODAY, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN SO MUCH. OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS SOME THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVEN'T SEEN FOR A LONG TIME. MAYBE EVER. NO MORE PUTTING OUR COUNTRY SECOND, THIRD, 20TH, 30TH. WE PUT AMERICA FIRST NOW. WE PUT IT FIRST. THANKS TO OUR STEEL TARIFFS, STEEL MILLS ARE NOW FIRING BACK UP ACROSS THE NATION. THEY ARE DOING FANTASTICALLY WELL, INCLUDING A BRAND-NEW $240 MILLION INVESTMENT IN POLK COUNTY. GOOD PLACE. WE ARE REPLACING THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE, IF NANCY PELOSI WILL EVER SIGN IT AND SEND IT. WE ARE WAITING, FOR MONTHS. USMCA IS AN INCREDIBLE AGREEMENT. EVERYBODY WANTS IT. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY A VICTORY. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE SHE WILL PUT IT. ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS MOVE IT FORWARD. IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST DEALS EVER. AT A CERTAIN POINT, CANADA AND MEXICO HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MANY MONTHS. THEY WILL SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S FORGET ABOUT IT. SHE HAS TO SIGN IT. EVERYBODY WANTS IT. SHE HAS TO PUT OUR COUNTRY FIRST. HAVE TO PUT OUR COUNTRY FIRST. IT'S A TREMENDOUS WIN FOR FLORIDA FARMERS AND ALL FARMERS, FOR GROWERS AND RANCHERS FROM ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. YET SHE AND THE DEMOCRATS JUST HAVE DONE NOTHING. THEY ARE DOING NOTHING, FOLKS. THEY ARE DOING NOTHING. IT'S A TERRIBLE THING. IT'S A TERRIBLE THING. CONGRESSWOMAN RECURSIVE PAL COME AWAY SHE? CONGRESSWOMAN SHALALA. I KNOW HER WELL, NEW YORK. GET HER TO PUT IT UP. NANCY IS ON TRACK TO GO DOWN AS THE SINGLE WORST AND LEAST PRODUCTIVE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. BEFORE MY ELECTION, OUR LEADERS USED THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS AS A PIGGY BANK TO FUND THEIR DELUSIONAL GLOBAL PROJECTS. IT'S ALL OVER THE GLOBE. I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I'M NOT PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD. THEY DECIMATED AMERICAN MANUFACTURING TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THEY USED OUR MILITARY TO DEFEND IMMENSELY WEALTHY NATIONS, SUBSIDIZING THEIR WELFARE STATES WITH YOUR MONEY. THEY SPEND TRILLIONS OF TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BY THE WAY, YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. WE ARE WINNING AND PULLING THEM BACK. A LOT OF FOLKS REPORTING TODAY, WE ARE DOING GREAT. WE DEFEATED ISIS, JUST A YOU UNDERSTAND. WE DEFEATED 100% OF THE ISIS CALIPHATE. WHEN WE SEE THEM FORMING, WE GO IN AND GET THEM. OUR MILITARY IS UNSURPASSED. THEY DID THIS WHILE OUR CITIES AT HOME FELL INTO DECAY AND DISREPAIR. WE SPENT $8 TRILLION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. AND WE WANT TO FIX A ROAD OR A HIGHWAY OR A SCHOOL, IT IS NOT EASY TO GET THE MONEY, BUT WE ARE GETTING IT DONE ANYWAY. AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING OTHER NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR NATION. IT IS ABOUT TIME. WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. AS LEADERS TRANSFORM FARAWAY NATIONS INTO BLOODSOAKED WAR ZONES, THEN DEMAND AMERICANS ACCEPT UNLIMITED MIGRATION INTO THOSE TERRITORIES. WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. WE ARE NOT DOING THAT. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL NOT ALLOW OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM TO BE USED AGAINST US. I WILL NOT ALLOW POLITICAL CORRECTNESS TO PUT OUR FAMILIES IN DANGER AND OUR COMMUNITIES AT RISK. WE WON'T DO IT. TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE FROM THESE GRAVE THREATS ABROAD, I IMPLEMENTED THE TRAVEL BAN. AND I JUST HEARD TODAY BY THE FAKE NEWS THAT THE TRAVEL BAN FAILED IN COURT. IT WON THE SUPREME COURT. WHAT THEY MEANT, IN AN EARLIER COURT, IT LOST. THEY SAID, HE LOST IN COURT ON THE TRAVEL BAN. THAT IS RIGHT, IN THE EARLY COURT. THEN I LOST AT THE APPELLATE DIVISION, THEN I WON AT THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, BUT THEY DIDN'T SAY THAT. THEY FORGOT TO TELL YOU THE LAST PART. SO WE ARE KEEPING TERRORISTS, WE ARE KEEPING CRIMINALS AND VIOLENT EXTREMISTS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE DOING GREAT ON THE BORDER. WE ARE DOING GREAT ON THE BORDER. ON NO ISSUE HAVE DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS BECOME MORE DANGEROUS THAN IMMIGRATION. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY WANTS OPEN BORDERS, WHICH IS A BETRAYAL OF EVERY MOTHER AND FATHER WHO WANTS DEADLY DRUGS TO BE KEPT OUT OF THEIR COMMUNITY. THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS. FIGURE THIS ONE. THEY WANT SANCTUARY CITIES, LET THE CRIMINALS GO IN. THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS, LET PEOPLE POUR INTO OUR COUNTRY NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE. AND THEY WANT HIGHER TAXES. ALL MY LIFE I GREW UP, AND I HAD GREAT INTEREST IN POLITICS, FORTUNATELY FOR YOU. I SAID, GEE, THEY ARE GOING TO LOWER TAXES. GOOD. THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE TAXES AND HAVE OPEN BORDERS. I DON'T THINK THAT PLAYS WELL. WHAT DO I KNOW? THE THREAT IS TO EVERY CHILD WHOSE SCHOOL IS UNDER SIEGE FROM THESE HORRIBLE GANGS THEY WOULD ALLOW IN, LIKE MS-13. WE HAVE TAKEN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MS-13 GANG MEMBERS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY AND BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM. IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WE BELIEVE ALL AMERICANS, INCLUDING WONDERFUL LEGAL IMMIGRANTS, ARE ENTITLED TO AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT PUTS THEIR NEEDS FIRST. WE WANT TO LET PEOPLE COME IN, BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY AND THEY HAVE TO COME IN THROUGH MERIT. BUT THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE BORDER, BORDER PATROL, I.C.E, LAW ENFORCEMENT INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. ILLEGAL CROSSINGS ARE DOWN 70% SINCE MAY, AND THE WALL IS GOING UP FASTER THAN ANYONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT. THAT WASN'T EASY. GETTING THAT WASN'T EASY. THE DEMOCRATS WOULD GIVE ME ANYTHING, ANY MONEY, BILLIONS AND BILLIONS FOR ANYTHING, EXCEPT THE WALL. THE ONLY REASON THEY DO NOT WANT THE WALL IS BECAUSE I WANTED IT. THEY ALWAYS SAY I NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR A MISTAKE, BUT I DID. I SHOULD HAVE SAID WE WILL NOT BUILD A WALL, AND THEY WOULD HAVE WANTED TO BUILD THE WALL. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? WE ARE REMOVING ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS FROM CENTRAL AMERICA AT A PACE NEVER DONE BEFORE. DURING MY FIRST TWO YEARS IN OFFICE. ARE YOU OK? OKAY. DOCTOR, PLEASE. THANK YOU. HE IS STRONG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DOCTOR, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, FELLAS. GREAT. DON'T FORGET, THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STANDING FOR 2.5 DAYS. THAT'S A LOT. THANK YOU. COME ON BACK IF YOU ARE FEELING WELL, OKAY? THAT IS THE MAN I ASKED A QUESTION TO BEFORE, AND HE GAVE ME A GOOD ANSWER. YOU COME BACK WHEN YOU ARE FEELING BETTER, OKAY? COME BACK. TOUGH GUY. THANK YOU. THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU. FIREFIGHTERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHAT A GREAT JOB. THEY ARE RIGHT ON THE BALL, OUR PEOPLE. AMAZING. THANK YOU. BRING HIM BACK AS SOON AS HE FEELS BETTER. DURING MY FIRST TWO YEARS IN OFFICE, BORDER PATROL SEIZED 7000 MORE POUNDS OF DEADLY DRUGS THAN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. SEIZURES OF HEROIN WERE UP. THE FAR LEFT'S IN PLACE OF SANCTUARY CITIES DEMONSTRATES THEIR DISDAIN FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS. SANCTUARY CITIES HAVE ADOPTED A POLICY OF LAWLESS ANARCHY, AIMED AT INNOCENT CIVILIANS. THEY DELIBERATELY RELEASE DANGEROUS CRIMINALS ONTO OUR STREETS, OUT OF OUR JAILS. IT IS CRAZY. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE CITIZENS SHOULD BE SANCTUARIES TO LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS. IN THE DEMOCRAT PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE RAISED THEIR HAND AND PLEDGED TO GIVE ILLEGAL ALIENS FREE HEALTH CARE, COURTESY OF YOU, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I WILL NEVER ALLOW DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTH CARE AND GIVE IT TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTSS. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS DETERMINED TO LAUNCH A DETERMINED TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY YOUR DOCTOR, EVISCERATE MEDICARE, AND PUT EVERY SINGLE SENIOR CITIZEN AT RISK. REPUBLICANS WILL ALWAYS SAFEGUARD MEDICARE FOR OUR CHERISHED SENIORS. ALWAYS. WE WILL STRONGLY PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, AND WE WILL PROTECT YOUR PRE-EXISTING PHYSICIANS. WHICH THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOT GOING TO BE DOING. THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORT TO LOWER THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, DRUG PRICES HAVE DECLINED IN OUR COUNTRY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 50 YEARS. THINK OF THAT. BUT AS WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOUR GOVERNOR TO BRING DRUG PRICES DOWN EVEN MORE HERE IN FLORIDA AND OTHER STATES, IF THEY WANT IT IT IS WHAT RON SAID, WE ARE ALLOWING YOUR STATE TO BUY THE IDENTICAL DRUG, OFTEN MADE IN THE SAME FACTORY, FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE PRICES ARE 70% LOWER. THAT IS BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM IS ALL SCREWED UP. I SAY, GO TO CANADA TO BUY THEM. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE DRUGS. WE ARE GIVING FLORIDA THE RIGHT TO BUY AT A MUCH LOWER PRICE. VIRTUALLY EVERY TOP DEMOCRATS ALSO SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTIONS, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB, RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THAT IS WHY I ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION, BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. DEMOCRATS ARE NOW PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, LATE-TERM ABORTION, SOCIALISM, AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND REMEMBER THIS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. WE FORGOT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN. AND I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THE MOST IMPORTANT THING A PRESIDENT CAN DO IS THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES. I SAY MAYBE THE MILITARY, BECAUSE WITHOUT THE MILITARY, WE ARE NOT SO INTERESTED IN JUDGES, RIGHT? I THINK THE MILITARY. BUT WE HAVE APPOINTED MORE THAN 160 FEDERAL JUDGES, INCLUDING COURT OF APPEAL JUDGES, TO INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN. AND WE WILL SOON HAVE 182, WHICH WILL BE A RECORD. WE ARE STRONGLY PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT, BECAUSE WE WANT AMERICA TO HAVE THE CLEANEST AIR AND CLEANEST WATER ANYWHERE ON EARTH. HERE IN FLORIDA, AS I PROMISED, WE DELIVERED OVER HALF OF $1 BILLION TO FIX LAKE OKEECHOBEE. REMEMBER I KEPT SAYING WE ARE GOING TO DO IT? MUCH MORE THAN $500 MILLION. WE HAD IT FIXED. WE FIXED THE HERBERT HOOVER TAKE AND FIXED THE SYSTEMS IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES. WE DID THAT ALTOGETHER. THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DOING IT FOR YEARS. THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. IT IS FINISHED IN SOME CASES. ALMOST FINISHED. ALL OF THE MONEY HAS BEEN GOTTEN FOR FLORIDA. I SIGNED LEGISLATION AUTHORIZING TO FIGHT RED TIDE AND OTHER TOXIC ALGAE. NOW RON HAS GOT THE MONEY HE WANTS, SO HE WILL STRAIGHTEN IT OUT. $100 MILLION. TOGETHER WE WILL PRESERVE FLORIDA'S NATURAL MAJESTIC BEAUTY FOR EVERY GENERATION TO COME. WE ARE INVESTING OVER $2 TRILLION. THINK OF IT. UP TO $2.5 TRILLION IN OUR MILITARY, INCLUDING $200 MILLION FOR MILITARY INSTALLATIONS. I LOVE THAT PANHANDLE. WOW. REMEMBER DURING THE ELECTION, THAT GREAT ELECTION NIGHT. 2016, WAS THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST EVENINGS EVER? AND FLORIDA WAS COMING IN SORT OF EVEN. WE ARE DOING WELL. A LITTLE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. FLORIDA WINS THE FIRST REALLY BIG STATE. EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT. WE ARE PRETTY EVEN WITH CROOKED HILLARY. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE HIT A THING CALLED THE PANHANDLE. IT WAS LIKE A ROCKET SHIP. WE TAKE CARE OF THE PANHANDLE. WE LOVE THE PANHANDLE. WE ALSO SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON MACDILL AIR FORCE BASE IN TAMPA. IN PANAMA CITY, WE ARE BUILDING BIG, BEAUTIFUL SHIPS FOR OUR INCREDIBLE COAST GUARD. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN TEXAS WITH THE HURRICANES, PUERTO RICO. THIS STATE WILL PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE SIXTH BRANCH OF OF THE U.S. MILITARY, THE SPACE FORCE. THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO STOP IT, BUT I THINK WE ARE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE. THAT IS THE NEW FRONTIER. YOU LOOK AT CHINA. YOU LOOK AT RUSSIA. IT IS ABOUT SPACE. WE ARE BEHIND. WE WILL NEVER BE BEHIND LIKE THAT AGAIN. SPACE FORCE. BRAND-NEW. I WITHDREW FROM THE HORRIBLE, ONE-SIDED IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. I RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S THROUGH CAPITAL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. AND WE HAVE RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THAT DONE FOR 52 YEARS. THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON JERUSALEM AND THE EMBASSY IN THE CAPITAL FOR MANY MANY PRESIDENTS. EVERYBODY SAID WE ARE GOING TO DO IT DURING THE CAMPAIGN. NEVER GOT DONE. WE HAVE A MAN WITH US TONIGHT, THE AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL, AMBASSADOR DAVID FREEMAN. WHERE IS HE? DID I DO A GOOD JOB FOR ISRAEL, DAVID? GREAT AMBASSADOR. GREAT SUCCESS STORY. HERE IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE, WE ARE CONFRONTING THE BRUTAL MENACE OF COMMUNISM AND SOCIALISM. WE ARE PRESENTLY SUPPORTING THE GREAT PEOPLE OF VENEZUELA, CUBA, AND NICARAGUA IN THEIR RIGHTEOUS STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM. YOU KNOW THAT. AND FOR THOSE WHO WOULD TRY TO IMPOSE THE HORRORS OF SOCIALISM ON OUR COUNTRY, I SAY TONIGHT, AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN TURNING BACK TO THE PAST OF AMERICAN DECLINE. WE WERE DECLINING. WE WERE NOT RESPECTED. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. WE WERE NOT RESPECTED. EVERYONE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF OUR COUNTRY. YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. THIS GENTLEMAN SAID WE WERE FOR SALE. WE ARE NOT FOR SALE ANYMORE. BUT NOW WE ARE CONTINUING FORWARD TO A FUTURE OF AMERICAN STRENGTH AND DOMINANCE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DOMINANCE LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE DOING. NOBODY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO SEE THIS. AND AMERICAN PROSPERITY. IT IS A CHOICE WHETHER OUR COUNTRY IS RULED BY CORRUPT POLITICIANS. YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. THEY THINK IT IS EASY. THEY HAVE BEEN ENTRENCHED FOR A LONG TIME, SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE. OR WHETHER WE WILL BE RULED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. FOR YEARS AND YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOUR POLITICIANS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK, DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE. TOGETHER, WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR, SAFE, SANE, AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION. THEY DON'T WANT TO APPROVE LOOPHOLES. THEY DON'T WANT TO APPROVE ANYTHING. THEY WANT PEOPLE TO POUR IN TO OUR COUNTRY. MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE VERY BAD PEOPLE. WITH THE HELP OF OUR GOVERNOR AND GREAT CONGRESSMAN AND SENATORS, WE WILL FIGHT TO GIVE SCHOOL CHOICE TO EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA WHO NEEDS IT. WE WILL ENACT TRADE DEALS. THEY ARE COMING ALONG GREAT. WE JUST FINISHED OUR THE DEAL WITH JAPAN. WE JUST DID OUR DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA. WE MADE THEM INTO GOOD DEALS, FAIR DEALS. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO MAKE A DEAL, THAT IS OK, WE WILL JUST TARIFF THE PRODUCT THAT POURS INTO YOUR COUNTRY. WE ARE ENACTING TRADE DEALS THAT RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, 'MADE IN THE USA.' WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA WITHIN 10 YEARS. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? WE NOW HAVE THE SCIENCE TO DO IT. AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN STARTED BEFORE MY ADMINISTRATION, BUT THEY DIDN'T DO THAT. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WAS POSSIBLE? WHEN THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THAT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, I SAID I DID NOT KNOW THAT. THE DOCTORS SAID THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO. THEY WILL END THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN 10 YEARS. WE WILL CHART A NEW ERA OF SPACE. WE WILL SOON LAND AN ASTRONAUT ON THE SURFACE OF MARS. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SHOOTING FOR. NASA IS DOING A GREAT JOB. WE HAVE SOME PRIVATE RICH GUYS. THEY LOVE ROCKET SHIPS. WE SAID, GO AHEAD, ELON, PLAY YOUR GAMES, JUST PAY US SOME NICE RENT, PLEASE. WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, FREE AND ASSEMBLY, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. AND ABOVE ALL, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS ONE, BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY, AS ONE AMERICA. WE SUPPORT PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. WE STAND WITH THE INCREDIBLE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND TO ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. WE WILL ALWAYS LIVE BY THE WORDS AND NOBODY WILL TAKE THEM AWAY NOBODY OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, IN GOD WE TRUST. NOBODY IS TAKING THEM AWAY. WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO CROSSED THE OCEANS, SETTLED THE CONTINENT, TAMED THE WILDERNESS, REVOLUTIONIZED INDUSTRY, PIONEERED SCIENCE, WON TWO WORLD WARS, DEFEATED FASCISM AND COMMUNISM, LANDED MEN ON THE MOON, AND MADE AMERICA THE GREATEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND WE ARE MAKING IT GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY, AND TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE TAKING IT BACK FROM SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WITH YOUR HELP, YOUR DEVOTION, AND YOUR DRIVE, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. WE ARE ONE MOVEMENT, ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY, AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION, UNDER GOD. OUR BEAUTIFUL AMERICA IS THRIVING LIKE NEVER BEFORE, AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE BEST IS YET TO COME. TRUE. WE WILL, TOGETHER, MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. THAT IS HAPPENING. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN. THAT HAS HAPPENED. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA PROUD AGAIN. THAT IS HAPPENING AND HAS HAPPENED. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

We're hitting what people want , law and order , which Biden was unable to even talk about because he'd lose the radical left , his radical-left followers. I don't think there's too many of them left. But I thought it was a great evening. It was an exciting evening. I see the ratings were very high. And it was good to be there. It felt very comfortable.

         "Well, thank you, Secretary Azar. And to the Secretary, to Surgeon General Jerome Adams, Assistant Secretary Lynn Johnson, the Associate Commissioner Jerry Milner, to all the many families gathered here and those looking on who've answered the call to open your hearts and your homes: It is wonderful to be here at HHS and to be a part of the most pro-adoption administration in American history. (Applause.) And I want to thank each and every one of you for the role that you're playing. And especially, I want to congratulate the honorees who will be recognized as a part of this program today. Each and every one of you have opened your homes and opened your hearts to become forever families. And I want you to know that you have the respect of this President, of his Vice President, and of the American people. And I offer my heartfelt congratulations. I also want to , I also want to express appreciation to the Secretary of HHS. He and I worked together in the state of Indiana. He's a man who has built an extraordinary career. But I know of no one in this administration with a greater heart for American families than Secretary Alex Azar. Would you join me in thanking him for his great work? (Applause.) You can get on your feet if you feel as strongly about him as I do. Secretary Alex Azar, everybody. (Applause.) And the whole HHS team deserves that same round of applause. And there's so many good friends in the room, but there's one friend I haven't seen for a little while. She and I both served as governors of our home state and she emerged as a national leader. And her faith and her dedication to family has literally inspired millions of Americans. And I'm not surprised that when we were talking about adoption, Governor Sarah Palin had to be with us today. Governor Palin, thank you so much for joining us and for your great support of adoptive families across America. (Applause.) And speaking of friends of mine, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine who is a great champion of American families and a strong champion of adoption and adoptive families. I bring greetings and the admiration of the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, in his proclamation on this National Adoption Month, President Trump acknowledged, in his words, that, 'Every child , born and unborn , is uniquely gifted by their Creator and endowed with both potential and immeasurable value,' and that, in this month, we, as Americans 'recognize the loving and devoted individuals who are part of God's plan for every child by taking a role as a parent through adoption.' For the last quarter century, Americans all across this country have taken time during this month to celebrate adoptive families and to celebrate adoption in this country. In November 1984, President Ronald Reagan marked the very first National Adoption Week to encourage a national effort to promote the adoption of children, and particularly children with special needs. And just a few years later, this week was expanded into an entire month. And today's gathering here at HHS is just one more installment in the admiration and gratitude the American people feel to all of our adoptive families. Every year since, leaders in government, industry, and faith communities have come together to raise awareness for the need to help vulnerable children to find permanent families and forever homes. And since the first day of this administration, under the leadership of this President, and with the hard work of all the dedicated men and women here at HHS, I'm proud to say that we've been working tirelessly to advance that vision to strengthen families and support the most vulnerable among us, including, we've been working every day to reduce the need for children to enter foster care in the first place. (Applause.) Last year, President Trump signed into law the Family First Prevention Act, which matches federal funds with state programs to help parents get the help they need to keep their children at home, to keep them safe from substance abuse and the challenges of mental illness. It's expanded resources to combat substance abuse and provide mental health services and family counseling at the state level across this country. And as the President said at the time, 'Providing a stable, secure, and nurturing home environment is one of the greatest gifts a parent or guardian can give to a child.' That also includes a foster parent. And when it becomes necessary for children to be placed in foster care, this legislation made it easier than ever for states to find safe, loving families to care for them. And I'm proud to report that, this year, for the first time in nearly 10 years, we've actually seen the number of children placed in foster care decline across America. (Applause.) We're keeping families together and addressing the real needs and challenges they face. In fact, last year, more children than ever , that more children than ever were not only , not only , excuse me, let me say, last year, we saw a decline in the number of children going to foster care. But maybe most encouraging to everyone gathered here at this important celebration: Last year, more children than ever were adopted from foster care, as well, to forever families. (Applause.) It's amazing to think, because of the generosity and the large-heartedness of families just like those we're celebrating today, more than 63,000 children found their forever homes with the help and support of loving families across this country. It really is incredible. So, recommendations to foster care are declining, and those in foster care are being adopted at a record pace. That's real success for strengthening families in America. And this success requires all of us to continue to work together. And it depends on generosity and love and the dedication of countless adoptive families, like a family I heard about on the way here, who, not long ago, grew from four to five through adoption. I'm told they met their future daughter through school where , where their her new mom works as a counselor and a school teacher. And this young woman lost her father when she was two; she lost her mother when she was 10. And after years of living in a group home, I'm told that she'd actually given up , she'd given up on ever being adopted, believing, as she said , she said, 'I was alone, and I knew I was going to be alone forever.' But she was wrong. And just 51 days before her 18th birthday, that young woman had a new brother, a new sister, two new parents, and a new last name. Now she's in college, and she's studying to be an art therapist. So would you join me in recognizing one of this year's Adoption Excellence Award winners: her mom and dad Chris and Gigi Kean, and their wonderful and inspiring daughter, Maci? Where are you? (Applause.) Great. Great to have you all here. And thank you for your inspiring example. What a special, special family. And let me tell you, as you study to be an art therapist, the Second Lady of the United States is going to be excited to hear that. (Laughter.) She's become one of the premier champions of art therapy across this country. So, much success to you, Maci. Today, we're also recognizing a family from Minnesota, who I'm told, adopted their youngest but tallest family member , (laugher) , just a few years ago, and they were already the picture of the American Dream: two successful parents; a passionate and philanthropic daughter; a dedicated son, well on his way to becoming an Eagle Scout. But they felt the need , they felt the call to foster a child for years. And after discovering how many older children age out of potential adoption, they decided to begin the journey towards adopting a teenager. Eventually, I'm told, they were matched with a young man who had spent most of his adolescence in foster care. And before long, they knew where he belonged. They knew he belonged in their home and to be a part of their forever family. In fact, his mother's words said he, at one point, looked them in the eye and said, 'I want to join your family.' And their family said 'yes.' Today, this family five does everything together, including advocating for adoption, part of what we'll celebrate today: adoption, especially of adolescent and older children. So join me in thanking another one of this year's Adoption Excellence Award winners, Scott and Amy Arntson, and their incredible son, Isaiah. Take a bow, will you? (Applause.) That's great. Thank you, Amy. Great job. Really great job. You know, these incredible families are emblematic of all of our honorees today and, frankly, emblematic of adoptive families all across this country. And they represent the shared success of all of us working together to expand opportunities for adoption, to expand and develop all across this country. So , but for all of our honorees, give them all a round of applause. They're all going to be recognized. You all inspire us. But we're here today because families like these, and businesses and local governments, have all worked together to expand access to adoption all across this country. And I want to assure you, under this President and this Vice President and our entire administration, we're going to continue to work to expand adoption for families all across America. (Applause.) But we understand there's still , there's still more work to do. And the truth is, every year, some 20,000 young people age out of foster care without the support of a permanent family to help them navigate those early years of adulthood. And even now, more than 125,000 children are in foster care across the country, waiting for adoption. And more than half have been in foster care for more than two years. So while we celebrate the progress that we've made , 63,000 children from foster care to forever families , I know I don't have to tell any and all of you here that there's much more work to be done. And I promise you, at the President's direction, this administration will continue to work with all of you, with leaders in local government and business and communities all across this country, and we'll continue to work in public and private partnerships to promote adoption across the land , like those being created by one of our award winners today, the Child Welfare Division of Louisiana's Department of Child and Family Services, which I am told has actually achieved three consecutive years of record-breaking adoption numbers in their state. (Applause.) Wow. Where's that team? Who's representing that wonderful child welfare team? Take a bow, will you, please? Fantastic job. And we're also inspired by organizations like America's Kids Belong that's going to be honored here today. It matches older children and youth aging out of foster care with generous supporters who are out there meeting their basic needs, connecting them with new opportunities, including for employment, helping them to achieve their dreams. So how about a big round of applause for that team, too? Where are you? (Applause.) Take a bow. Thank you. And let me assure all of you that we also understand the role that communities of faith play in adoption. And we're going to continue to support many faith-based organizations that have always and will continue to play a vital role in helping vulnerable children find forever homes. And I couldn't be more proud that, at President Trump's direction, and with the strong support of leaders across foster care, adoption, and our faith communities, we've taken decisive action. We've reversed the rule implemented in the closing days of the last administration that jeopardized the ability of faith-based providers to serve those in need by penalizing them for their deeply held religious beliefs. We will stand for the freedom of religion and we will stand with faith-based organizations to support adoption. (Applause.) Thank you. And I want to commend Secretary Azar and the team here at HHS for promulgating the new rule that respects the freedom of religion of every American, but also recognizes the vital role that faith-based organizations play in adoption in this country. So I thank you, Mr. Secretary, and I thank the HHS team. I know the President is grateful. The truth is, four out of five families have pointed to faith and church support as a factor in successful fostering. And countless families rely on their faith communities as they adopt and incorporate children into their lives. And I'll make you one more promise: Child welfare providers will never be forced to choose between their faith and serving those in need , not on our watch. (Applause.) So I thank you all for allowing me to join you today. This is a great celebration, and it's one that's near and dear to my heart. And it's such an honor for me to be a part of the most pro-adoption administration in this history. And as I said earlier, the President talked about every child , born and unborn , being a sacred gift from God. And I truly do believe that if you're going to be pro-life, you need to be pro-adoption. And we are. (Applause.) And the truth is, I have some personal experience in this , or at least we almost did in our family. When Karen and I were starting to get our family going, we went through , as many couples do , years of unexplained infertility. And so we began to enter the adoptive process. We prayed through it. We made the decision that we would adopt a child, believing that maybe that was how God was going to put our little family together. And when the call came that we were in the queue for an adoption, the call also came from our doctor that Karen was expecting after five and a half years of unexplained infertility. We only had one question though. And that was: The second family in line, were they clinically infertile? Because we had already decided to open our hearts and our home to a child. And when we learned that the family right after us could not adopt , or could not have a child, we stepped out of the way because God was blessing us with a family and we wanted Him to be able to bless them as well. (Applause.) But we'd already crossed that threshold. Like the adoptive families that we'll celebrate here today, we had already made the decision. And so while I've not experienced the blessing of being an adoptive family, I , I understand the decision that you make in doing it. And I admire it deeply, as does every American. I mean, the truth of the matter is that people deserve to know that there's roughly the same number of couples experiencing unfertility , infertility in this country than there are abortions. Literally, year after year, the number of families that struggle with unexplained infertility is roughly equal to the number of abortions. And so, I truly do believe as we stand without apology for the sanctity of life, we must stand for and expand access to adoption in America. That's how we make progress, by putting families together. (Applause.) So thank you again. Thank you for letting me share that from my heart. And thank you for letting me come and just congratulate each and every one of you today. Thank you for stepping up to serve those in need, through foster care, through adoption. What you do, you do for the most vulnerable among us. And you do for America. And during this National Adoption Month, know that your compassion and your love are changing lives and they're changing this country. And never doubt that the American people are with you, that they admire you. I'm sure you hear it as you get stopped outside of CVS or people stop you at work and worship and just express their admiration for your decision to become adoptive parents. Never doubt that this President and our entire administration stand with you to continue to expand and support adoption and lift it up as a means of expanding forever families across this country. And I also believe that you should never doubt that He , who said, whatever you do for the least of these, you do for me , will bless every family that opens their home and their hearts to adoption. So thank you to our honorees. Congratulations. God bless you. God bless your forever families. And God bless America. (Applause.)",

         "Okay, thank you very much. In a few moments, I'll be signing an executive order imposing hard-hitting sanctions on the Supreme Leader of Iran and the Office of the Supreme Leader of Iran, and many others. Today's action follows a series of aggressive behaviors by the Iranian regime in recent weeks, including shooting down of U.S. drones. They shot down the drone. It's , I guess everyone saw that one. And many other things. They've done many other things aside from the individual drone. You saw the tankers, and we know of other things that were done also, which were not good and not appropriate. The Supreme Leader of Iran is one who ultimately is responsible for the hostile conduct of the regime. He's respected within his country. His office oversees the regime's most brutal instruments, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Sanctions imposed through the executive order that I'm about to sign will deny the Supreme Leader and the Supreme Leader's Office, and those closely affiliated with him and the office, access to key financial resources and support. The assets of Ayatollah Khamenei and his office will not be spared from the sanctions. These measures represent a strong and proportionate response to Iran's increasingly provocative actions. We will continue to increase pressure on Tehran until the regime abandons its dangerous activities and its aspirations, including the pursuit of nuclear weapons, increased enrichment of uranium, development of ballistic missiles, engagement in and support for terrorism, fueling of foreign conflicts, and belligerent acts directed against the United States and its allies. The agreement that was signed was a disaster. It was not doing what it was supposed to do. Many bad things were taking place. And, most importantly, it was so short-term that, within a very short number of years, they would be able to make nuclear weapons. And that's unacceptable. Never can Iran have a nuclear weapon. Also included in this is we want the stoppage immediately of their sponsoring of terrorism. They sponsor terrorism at a level that nobody has ever seen before, and that's been over the last number of years. And they've taken all of that money that was given to them by the past administration, and much of it was given out to terrorist organizations. In fact, I remember when John Kerry was asked a question about whether or not this money will be spent for terror. He actually said 'yes' , or at least he was referring to some of it. But he said, 'Yes, it will be used for terror,' if you can believe that. We're giving them money. We're saying, 'Yes, it can be used for terror.' That was not a good answer, but that was the least of it, frankly. So, America is a peace-loving nation. We do not seek conflict with Iran or any other country. I look forward to the day when sanctions can be finally lifted and Iran can become a peaceful, prosperous, and productive nation. That can go very quickly; it can be tomorrow. It can also be in years from now. So I look forward to discussing whatever I have to discuss with anybody that wants to speak. In the meantime, who knows what's going to happen. I can only tell you we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon. And it won't happen. And secondly, and very importantly, we don't want money going out to sponsor terror. They are the number-one sponsor of terror anywhere in the world. So I'll sign this order right now. And I want to thank our military. I want to thank all of the people that have been working with me over the last number of months on this. I think a lot of restraint has been shown by us. A lot of restraint. And that doesn't mean we're going to show it in the future. But I felt that we want to give this a chance , give it a good chance, because I think Iran, potentially, has a phenomenal future. Just , and I say that about North Korea, too. I've said it about North Korea. I think North Korea has a phenomenal future. And I think Iran also has a phenomenal future. And we'd would like to , I think a lot of people would like to see them get to work on that great future. So I'll sign this now. And I appreciate you all being here. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much, everybody.",

         "On July 4, 1863, America woke to the remains of perhaps the most consequential battle ever fought on American soil. It took place here on this ground in Gettysburg. Three days of violence, three days of carnage. 50,000 casualties wounded, captured, missing or dead. Over three days of fighting. When the sun rose on that Independence Day, Lee would retreat. The war would go on for nearly two more years, but the back of the Confederacy had been broken. The Union would be saved, slavery would be abolished. Government of, by, and for the people would not perish from the earth, and freedom would be born anew in our land. There is no more fitting place than here today in Gettysburg to talk about the cost of division , about how much it has cost America in the past, about how much it is costing us now, and about why I believe in this moment we must come together as a nation. For President Lincoln, the Civil War was about the greatest of causes: the end of slavery, the widening of equality, the pursuit of justice, the creation of opportunity, and the sanctity of freedom. His words here would live ever after. We hear them in our heads, we know them in our hearts, we draw on them when we seek hope in the hours of darkness. 'Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.' Here, on this sacred ground, Abraham Lincoln reimagined America itself. Here, a president of the United States spoke of the price of division and the meaning of sacrifice. He believed in the rescue, the redemption, and the rededication of the Union, all this in a time not just of ferocious division, but also widespread death, structural inequality, and fear of the future. And he taught us this: A house divided could not stand. That is a great and timeless truth. Today, once again, we are a house divided. But that, my friends, can no longer be. We are facing too many crises. We have too much work to do. We have too bright a future to leave it shipwrecked on the shoals of anger and hate and division. As we stand here today, a century and a half after Gettysburg, we should consider again what can happen when equal justice is denied, and when anger and violence and division are left unchecked. As I look across America today, I'm concerned. The country is in a dangerous place. Our trust in each other is ebbing. Hope is elusive. Too many Americans see our public life not as an arena for the mediation of our differences. Rather, they see it as an occasion for total, unrelenting partisan warfare. Instead of treating the other party as the opposition, we treat them as the enemy. This must end. We need to revive a spirit of bipartisanship in this country, a spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, I'm accused of being na�ve. I'm told maybe that's the way things used to work, but they can't anymore. Well, I'm here to say they can. And they must if we're going to get anything done. I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I will work with Democrats and Republicans and I will work as hard for those who don't support me as for those who do. That's the job of a president. It's a duty of care for everyone. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision. A choice we make. And if we can decide not to cooperate, we can decide to cooperate as well. That's the choice I'll make as president. But there is something bigger going on in the nation than just our broken politics, something darker, something more dangerous. I'm not talking about ordinary differences of opinion. Competing viewpoints give life and vibrancy to our democracy. No, I'm talking about something different, something deeper. Too many Americans seek not to overcome our divisions, but to deepen them. We must seek not to build walls, but bridges. We must seek not to clench our fists, but to open our arms. We must seek not to tear each other apart, but to come together. You don't have to agree with me on everything , or even on most things , to see that what we're experiencing today is neither good nor normal. I made the decision to run for president after Charlottesville. Close your eyes. Remember what you saw. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists and the K coming out of the fields with torches lit. Veins bulging. Chanting the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the 1930s. It was hate on the march, in the open. In America. Hate never goes away. It only hides. And when it is given oxygen, when it is given the opportunity to spread, when it is treated as normal and acceptable behavior we have opened a door in this country we must move quickly to close. As President, I will do that. I will send a clear, unequivocal message to the nation. There is no place for hate in America. It will be given no license. It will be given no oxygen. It will be given no safe harbor. In recent weeks and months, the country has been roiled by instances of excessive police force, by heart wrenching cases of racial injustice and lives needlessly and senselessly lost, by peaceful protests giving voice to the calls for justice, and by examples of violence and looting and burning that cannot be tolerated. I believe in law and order. I have never supported defunding the police. But I also believe injustice is real. It's the product of a history that goes back 400 years, to the moment when black men, women, and children were first brought here in chains. I do not believe we have to choose between law and order and racial justice in America. We can have both. This nation is strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism, and strong enough to provide safe streets for our families and small businesses that too often bear the brunt of this looting and burning. We have no need for armed militias roaming America's streets, and we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacist groups menacing our communities. If you say we should trust America's law enforcement authorities to do their jobs as I do, then let them do their job without extremist groups acting as vigilantes. And if you say we have no need to face racial injustice in this country, you haven't opened your eyes to the truth in America. There have been powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months. George Floyd's 6-year old daughter Gianna, who I met with, was one such voice when she said, 'Daddy changed the world.' Also, Jacob Blake's mother was another when she said violence didn't reflect her son and that this nation needed healing. And Doc Rivers, the basketball coach choking back tears when he said, 'We're the ones getting killed. We're the ones getting shot We've been hung. It's amazing why we keep loving this country, and this country does not love us back.' Think about that. Think about what it takes for a Black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country that for far too long we have never fully recognized. What we need in America is leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, to open lines of communication, and to bring us together. To heal. And to hope. As President, that is precisely what I will do. We have paid a high price for allowing the deep divisions in this country to impact how we have dealt with the coronavirus. 210,000 Americans dead and the numbers climbing. It's estimated that nearly another 210,000 Americans could lose their lives by the end of the year. Enough. No more. Let's set the partisanship aside. Let's end the politics. Let's follow the science. Wearing a mask isn't a political statement. It's a scientific recommendation. Social distancing isn't a political statement. It's a scientific recommendation. Testing. Tracing. The development, ultimately approval and distribution of a vaccine isn't a political statement. These are scientific-based decisions. We can't undo what has been done. We can't go back. But we can do better. We can do better starting today. We can have a national strategy that puts the politics aside and saves lives. We can have a national strategy that will make it possible for our schools and businesses to open safely. We can have a national strategy that reflects the true values of this nation. The pandemic is not a red state versus blue state issue. The virus doesn't care where you live or what political party you belong to. It infects us all. It will take anyone's life. It is a virus , not a political weapon. There's another enduring division in America that we must end: The divisions in our economic life that give opportunity only to the privileged few. America has to be about mobility. It has to be the kind of country where an Abraham Lincoln , a child of the distant frontier, can rise to our highest office. America has to be about the possibilities. The possibilities of prosperity. Not just for the privileged few. But for the many , for all of us. Working people and their kids deserve an opportunity. Lincoln knew this. He said that the country had to give people 'an open field and a fair chance.' And that's what we're going to do in the America we're going to build , together. We fought a Civil War that would secure a Union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all. And by fits and starts , our better angels have prevailed just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation. And those better angels can prevail again , now. They must prevail again , now. A hundred years after Lincoln spoke here at Gettysburg then Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson also came here and said: 'Our nation found its soul in honor on these fields of Gettysburg We must not lose that soul in dishonor now on the fields of hate.' Today we are engaged once again in a battle for the soul of the nation. The forces of darkness, the forces of division, the forces of yesterday are pulling us apart, holding us down, and holding us back. We must free ourselves of all of them. As president, I will embrace hope, not fear. Peace, not violence. Generosity, not greed. Light, not darkness. I will be a president who appeals to the best in us. Not the worst. I will be a president who pushes towards the future. Not one who clings to the past. I am ready to fight for you and for our nation. Every day. Without exception, without reservation. And with a full and devoted heart. We cannot , and will not , allow extremists and white supremacists to overturn the America of Lincoln and Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. To overturn the America that has welcomed immigrants from distant shores. To overturn the America that's been a haven and a home for everyone no matter their background. From Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, we're at our best when the promise of America is available to all. We cannot and will not allow violence in the streets to threaten the people of this nation. We cannot and will not walk away from our obligation to, at long last, face the reckoning on race and racial justice in the country. We cannot and will not continue to be stuck in a partisan politics that lets this virus thrive while the public health of this nation suffers. We cannot and will not accept an economic equation that only favors those who've already got it made. Everybody deserves a shot at prosperity. Duty and history call presidents to provide for the common good. And I will. It won't be easy. Our divisions today are of long standing. Economic and racial inequities have shaped us for generations. But I give you my word: If I am elected President, I will marshal the ingenuity and good will of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together. We can disagree about how to move forward, but we must take the first step. And it starts with how we treat one another, how we talk to one another, how we respect one another. In his Second Inaugural, Lincoln said, 'With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds.' Now we have our work to reunite America, to bind up the nation's wounds, to move past shadow and suspicion. And so we , you and I, together , press on, even now. After hearing the Second Inaugural Address, Frederick Douglass told the president: 'Mr. Lincoln, that was a sacred effort.' We must be dedicated now to our own sacred effort. The promise of Gettysburg, that a new birth of freedom was at hand, is at risk. Every generation that has followed Gettysburg has been faced with a moment , when it must answer this question , whether it will allow the sacrifices made here to be in vain. This is our moment to answer this essential American question for ourselves and for our time. And my answer is this: It cannot be that after all this country has been through. After all that America has accomplished, after all the years we have stood as a beacon of light to the world, it cannot be that here and now, in 2020, we will allow government of the people, by the people, and for the people to perish from this earth. No. It cannot. It must not. We have in our hands the ultimate power: the power of the vote. It is the noblest instrument ever devised to register our will in a peaceable and productive fashion. And so we must. We must vote. And we will vote no matter how many obstacles are thrown in our way. Because once America votes, America will be heard. Lincoln said: 'The nation is worth fighting for.' So it was. So it is. Together, as one nation, under God, indivisible, let us join forces to fight the common foes of injustice and inequality, of hate and fear. Let us conduct ourselves as Americans who love each other , who love our country and who will not destroy, but will build. We owe that to the dead who are buried here at Gettysburg. And we owe that to the living and to future generations yet to be born. You and I are part of a great covenant, a common story of divisions overcome and of hope renewed. If we do our part. If we stand together. If we keep faith with the past and with each other, then the divisions of our time can give way to the dreams of a brighter, better, future. This is our work. This is our pledge. This is our mission. We can end this era of division. We can end the hate and the fear. We can be what we are at our best: The United States of America. God bless you. And may God protect our troops.",

         "GOOD AFTERNOON. THE FIRST WOMAN, THE FIRST WOMAN IN HISTORY OF OUR NATION TO LIE IN STATE IN THE U.S. CAPITOL. AND THOUGH IT SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN NEARLY THIS LONG, TO BESTOW THAT HONOR ON A WOMAN, IT NONETHELESS SPEAKS OF THE IMPACT JUSTICE GINSBURG HAS MADE ON OUR SOCIETY AND HER ENDURING LEGACY OF EQUAL RIGHTS AND JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. SHORTLY BEFORE JUSTICE GINSBURG PASSED, SHE TOLD HER GRANDDAUGHTER , AND I QUOTE , 'MY MOST FERVENT WISH IS THAT I WILL NOT BE REPLACED UNTIL A NEW PRESIDENT IS INSTALLED. ' IT WAS NOT A PERSONAL REQUEST, IT WASN'T A FAVOR BEING ASKED FOR, IT WAS THE LAST ACT OF A LONG, UNFLINCHING CAREER OF STANDING UP FOR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. NEVER BEFORE IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY HAS A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BEEN NOMINATED AND INSTALLED WHILE A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS ALREADY UNDERWAY. IT DEFIES EVERY PRESIDENT, EVERY , EVERY PRECEDENT, EVERY EXPECTATION OF A NATION WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE SOVEREIGN AND THE RULE OF LAW REIGNS. BUT YESTERDAY, BEFORE JUSTICE GINSBURG COULD BE LAID TO REST AND AFTER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS HAD ALREADY CASTED , CAST THEIR BALLOTS, THE PRESIDENT NOMINATED A SUCCESSOR TO HER SEAT. THERE IS NO MYSTERY ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO THROW OUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO IT FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BEEN TRYING TO ELIMINATE IT FOR A DECADE. TWICE, THE SUPREME COURT HAS UPHELD THAT LAW, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND THE CONGRESS, EXPRESSING THE POPULAR WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, HAS REJECTED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EFFORTS AS WELL. NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THEY HAVE FOUND A LOOPHOLE IN THE TRAGEDY OF JUSTICE GINSBURG'S DEATH. IT DOESN'T MATTER TO THEM THAT THE REPUBLICANS SET A PRECEDENT JUST FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN THEY DENIED EVEN THE COURTESY OF A HEARING AFTER JUSTICE SCALIA PASSED AFTER HE PASSED AWAY NINE MONTHS PRIOR TO ELECTION DAY. IT DIDN'T MATTER TO THEM. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALREADY VOTING ON A NEW PRESIDENT AND A NEW CONGRESS HAD BEGUN. ALL THAT DOES MATTER IS THAT THEY SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO OVERTURN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON THEIR WAY OUT THE DOOR. AS I SPEAK, WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS IN A CENTURY, A CRISIS HAS TAKEN OVER 200,000 LIVES, BETWEEN 750 AND A THOUSAND LIVES A DAY AND COUNTING. AND YET, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING THE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW, AS I SPEAK, TO ELIMINATE THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THE ADMINISTRATION FILED A BRIEF IN THE SUPREME COURT THAT CONCLUDES, 'THE ENTIRE ACA THUS MUST FALL.' THE ENTIRE ACA THUS MUST FALL. PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN CLAIM ALL HE WANTS THAT HE IS GOING TO PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, BUT THE FACT IS HE IS ALREADY FIGHTING TO TAKE THOSE PROTECTIONS AWAY AS WE SPEAK. IF HE HAS HIS WAY, MORE THAN ONE , THAN 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA, DIABETES, AND CANCER COULD ONCE AGAIN BE DENIED COVERAGE. COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID-19 LIKE LUNG SCARRING AND HEART DAMAGE COULD BECOME THE NEXT FLOOD OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS USED AS AN EXCUSE TO DENY COVERAGE TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WOMEN COULD ONCE AGAIN BE CHARGED HIGHER PREMIUMS JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN. PREGNANCY BECOMING A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AGAIN. SENIORS COULD SEE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES GO UP. AND THE FUNDING FOR MEDICARE GO DOWN. IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT, PRESIDENT TRUMP SEES A CHANCE TO FULFILL HIS EXPLICIT MISSION , STEAL AWAY THE VITAL PROTECTIONS OF THE ACA FROM COUNTLESS FAMILIES WHO HAVE COME TO RELY ON THEM FOR THEIR HEALTH, FINANCIAL SECURITY, AND THE LIVES OF THOSE THEY LOVE. PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST TWEETED AN HOUR AGO ON MY WAY HERE, AND I QUOTE, 'OBAMACARE WILL BE REPLACED WITH A MUCH BETTER AND FAR CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE. IF IT IS TERMINATED IN THE SUPREME COURT, IT WOULD BE A BIG WIN FOR THE USA.' IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT ON SATURDAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD NOMINATE JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT, AND ON LAY SUNDAY OUT CLEARLY WHAT HIS OBJECTIVE IS, TO TERMINATE OBAMACARE. THE JUDGE HAS A WRITTEN TRACK RECORD OF DISAGREEING ADAMANTLY WITH THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISIONS, ON TWO OCCASIONS UPHOLDING THE ACA. IN FACT, NOT AS A JUDGE, BUT PRIOR TO GOING ON THE BENCH, SHE PUBLICLY CRITICIZED CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS' OPINION UPHOLDING THE LAW EIGHT YEARS AGO. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF THIS MOMENT. THEY ARE ALREADY VOTING IN DROVES BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR HEALTH CARE HANGS IN THE BALANCE. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IF DONALD TRUMP GETS HIS WAY, THEY COULD LOSE THEIR RIGHTS TO VOTE, THEY ARE RIGHT , THEIR RIGHT TO CLEAN AIR AND WATER, THEIR RIGHT TO EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, WORKERS COULD LOSE THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS, DREAMERS COULD BE THROWN OUT OF THE ONLY COUNTRY THEY HAVE EVER KNOWN, AND WOMEN COULD LOSE THE RIGHTS ENSHRINED IN ROE V. WADE FOR 50 YEARS. PEOPLE ARE VOTING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE VERY SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY IS AT STAKE AND BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT AFFECT THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES. THEIR VOICES MAY NOT MATTER TO DONALD TRUMP, THEY MAY NOT MATTER TO MITCH MCCONNELL, BUT THERE ARE SENATE REPUBLICANS WHO KNOW IN THEIR HEARTS THAT IF THEY SHUT OUT THE VOICES OF THOSE DURING A VOTING PERIOD, DURING AN ELECTION, CLOSING THE DOOR ON AMERICAN DEMOCRACY THEREAFTER. THIS IS WHERE THE POWER OF THE NATION RESIDES , IN THE PEOPLE, IN THE RULE OF LAW IN PRECEDENTS WE HAVE ABIDED BY. TO SUBVERT NEEDLESSLY, EVEN AS AMERICANS ARE CASTING THEIR VOTE WOULD BE A UNIVERSAL STEP TOWARDS THE BREAK AND A BETRAYAL IN THE EQUALITY AMERICA IS BUILT ON. THE PEOPLE DECIDE. SENATORS MUST NOT ACT ON THIS NOMINATION UNTIL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FINISH THE PROCESS THEY HAVE ALREADY BEGUN OF SELECTING THEIR PRESIDENT AND THEIR CONGRESS. AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, IF THE PEOPLE CHOOSE DONALD TRUMP, THEN THE SENATE SHOULD GIVE HIS NOMINEE A HEARING AND A VOTE. IF THE PEOPLE DO NOT CHOOSE TRUMP AND CHOOSE ME, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINATION SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN, I SHOULD NOMINATE, CHOSEN BY A PRESIDENT WHO HAS JUST BEEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, TO GET A FAIR HEARING, WHICH WOULD NOT EVEN OCCUR UNTIL EARLY FEBRUARY. A CONFIRMATION VOTE. THE U.S. CONSTITUTION PROVIDES ONE CHANCE , 1 , THE AMERICANS FOUR TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD ON WHO SERVES A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT ON THE SUPREME COURT. WHO MAKES THOSE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CARE, THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS, AND MUCH ELSE. THAT CHANCE IS NOW. THAT MOMENT IS NOW. THE VOTERS IN MY VIEW ARE NOT GOING TO STAND FOR THIS ABUSE OF POWER. AND FOR US TO CALL OURSELVES A DEMOCRACY, THEIR VOICES MUST BE HEARD. I URGE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO KEEP VOTING, TO LET YOUR CURRENT SENATORS KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO BE HEARD BEFORE A VOTE ON CONFIRMATION OF A NEW JUSTICE. AND I URGE EVERY SENATOR TO TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THE BRINK, TAKE OFF THE BLINDERS OF POLITICS FOR JUST ONE CRITICAL MOMENT AND STAND UP FOR THE CONSTITUTION YOU SWORE TO UPHOLD. THIS IS A TIME TO DE-ESCALATE, TO PUT AN END TO THE SHATTERING OF PRECEDENTS THAT HAS THROWN OUR NATION INTO CHAOS UNDER THIS PRESIDENT. JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE POWER TO DO SOMETHING DOES NOT ABSOLVE YOU OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO RIGHT BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. UPHOLD YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY, SOMEONE YOUR , SUMMON YOUR CONSCIENCE, STAND UP FOR THE PEOPLE, STAND UP FOR OUR SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. AMERICANS ARE WATCHING, AMERICANS ARE VOTING, AND WE MUST LISTEN TO THEM NOW. WE MUST ALLOW THEM TO EXERCISE THIS SACRED POWER. SO PLEASE LISTEN. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA, MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS, AND I WILL TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS.",

YOUR VOICES ARE SO POWERFUL, AND YOURS ARE THE VOICES OF OUR COUNTRY AND OUR FUTURE, AND ALWAYS USE THEM IN A WAY THAT OWNS THE POWER THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU FOR GRACING ME THIS EVENING WITH YOUR PRESENCE. DETROIT YOUTH CHOIR. I AM IN MICHIGAN, AGAIN. LEFT HER BECAUSE I LOVE BEING IN MICHIGAN AND YOU KNOW, DETROIT, IT REMINDS ME OF MY HOMETOWN OF OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA, SO MUCH. THERE IS SO MUCH HERE, SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME FROM DETROIT, SO MANY WHO HAVE BEEN PART OF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER AND THE LEADERSHIP OF WHO WE ARE. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT IS ABOUT DETROIT THAT IS NOT ONLY A MEASURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND IT'S EXCELLENCE BUT ALSO AS A MEASURE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AS A NATION. AND SO JOE AND I FEEL A PARTICULAR SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO BE HERE AND TO BE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW JOE BIDEN WAS HERE LAST , WEEK, WE WILL KEEP COMING BACK. BECAUSE SO GOES MICHIGAN GOES THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED. AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN MICHIGAN, AND I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN 130 CASES OF CODED WHEN I KNOW THAT WE HAVE , MOURNED THE LOSS OF OVER 7000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF THIS VIRUS. I LOOK AT THAT AND WHAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS DONE TO CHANGE THE LIVES OF ALL AMERICANS, WHAT IT HAS DONE TO PUT US IN A PLACE WHERE COLLECTIVELY WE ARE MOURNING AND GRIEVING THE LOSS OF LIFE. THE LOSS OF JOBS. THE LOSS OF NORMALCY. THE LOSS OF CONSISTENCY. AND WE HAVE AN ELECTION COMING UP IN 42 DAYS AND MICHIGAN WILL BE VOTING IN 48 HOURS. ON AN ISSUE THAT WILL CHART THE COURSE OF THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY IN A VERY DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE WAY. AND SO I REFERENCE THE PANDEMIC AS TESTAMENT TO THAT POINT. WE HAVE A CHOICE ON ONE HAND OF THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WHO, AS WE NOW KNOW NOT BECAUSE SOMEONE TOLD US ABOUT A CONVERSATION THEY HAD WITH HIM, BUT BECAUSE BOB WOODWARD RECORDED THE CONVERSATION THAT HE HAD WITH DONALD TRUMP, WHEN IN EARLY FEBRUARY IT BECAME CLEAR THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD BEEN BRIEFED IN JANUARY AND TALKED IN FEBRUARY ABOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE, HIS KNOWLEDGE, THAT THIS VIRUS COULD KILL HUMAN BEINGS. AND THAT IT IS AIRBORNE. HE UNDERSTOOD IT SO WELL HE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN HOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CATCHING SOMETHING IN THE AIR AND CATCHING SOMETHING ON THE SURFACE. JOE BIDEN WAS FUNNY, HE SAID, AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW THE GUY CAN READ. CLEARLY, HE GOT A BRIEFING. BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HAVING MISSED KNOWLEDGE, , HAVING THIS KNOWLEDGE, ALSO POSSESSING THE TITLE AND MY DUTY TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THEREBY HAVING THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CONCERN HIMSELF AS A FIRST PRIORITY AND WITH THE SAFETY AND THE WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY, WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE, HE WENT ON TO CALL THIS VIRUS A HOAX. WENT ON TO SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD DISMISS WHAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WERE TELLING US. TO THIS DAY, WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT NOW THE MARKER, THE SAD, AWFUL MARKER OF 200,000 LIVES THAT HAVE PERISHED IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. ALMOST 7 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS. AND TO THIS DAY, WE HAVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHO IS HOLDING RALLIES WITH NO MASK BECAUSE YOU SEE HE HAS CONVINCED EVERYONE, THAT YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU WEAR A MASK AND YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU DON'T. MAKING VALUE JUDGMENTS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED WITH NOT DYING. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE DESERVE BETTER. WE DESERVE AT HER. WE DESERVE BETTER. AND HERE'S THE OTHER THING, YOU COUPLE THAT WHICH IS ENOUGH, WITH THE FACT THAT RIGHT NOW DONALD TRUMP AND HIS BOY BILL BARR ARE IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC POLICY REFORMS IN MODERN HISTORY. CREATED BY BARACK OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, AND IT IS CALLED THE 'AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.' THE 'AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,' ALSO KNOWN AS 'OBAMACARE.' WHAT DID IT DO? IT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE AND COVERAGE TO OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE. IT SAID, IT'S NOT RIGHT TO PROHIBIT PEOPLE WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, LIKE DIABETES, LIKE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, FROM HAVING COVERAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. SO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SAID, YOU CAN NO LONGER BAN OR PROHIBIT SOMEONE WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION FROM HAVING THAT KIND OF ACCESS. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH RECOGNIZED THAT SO MANY OF OUR YOUNG LEADERS MIGHT GO INTO A JOB WHEN THEY LEAVE SCHOOL, THAT DOESN'T GIVE THEM HEALTH CARE COVERAGE, EVEN THOUGH THEY NEED IT. SO LET'S ALLOW THEM TO BE ON SO LET'S ALLOW THEM TO BE ON THEIR PARENTS' COVERAGE UNTIL THE AGE OF 26. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DID ALL OF THAT, AND YET, IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS IN COURT, TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. CHECK THAT OUT. IN THE MIDST OF A MOMENT THAT REQUIRES THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE GRAVELY SICK HAVE MEDICAL CARE. AND ACCESS TO CARE, WITHOUT BEING BURDENED WITH WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD IT, HE IS IN COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF IT. AND THE DETAILS ON THIS MATTER, BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS HE TRYING TO GET RID OF IT LET'S PUT IT IN , THE CONTEXT OF IF HE WINS. IF HE WINS THE ELECTION, AND IF HE WINS THE CASE, IF HE WINS THE CASE, THEN WE'RE LOOKING AT AN AMERICA WHEREIN AT LEAST US OF TODAY, 7 MILLION PEOPLE NOW HAVE, IN ADDITION TO THOSE FROM BEFORE, A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND THAT IS CALLED THEY CONTRACTED THE COVID VIRUS. WHERE PHYSICIANS ARE TELLING US THAT THERE ARE THINGS LIKE LUNG-SCARRING THAT MAY COME FROM THAT, OTHER UNKNOWN LONG-TERM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE IF HE WINS THIS ELECTION, WINS BEST THAT CASE, IN ADDITION TO OUR PARENTS, OUR GRANDPARENTS, OUR NEIGHBORS AND , THE PEOPLE WE LOVE WHO MAY HAVE DIABETES, WHO MAY HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, THE PEOPLE WE KNOW WHO MAY HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS AND THANK GOD THEY'VE LIVED , MAY BE DENIED COVERAGE IN THE FUTURE. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE VERY SPECIFIC THINGS THAT ARE AT PLAY IN THIS ELECTION. SO I AM HERE IN DETROIT ON BEHALF OF JOE BIDEN AT MYSELF. TO HONOR THE FACT THAT THE IMPACT OF THESE ISSUES WILL HAVE A GRAVE CONSEQUENCE AND IMPACT TO THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, AND THE CITY OF DETROIT. AND AS A MESSENGER OF THESE POINTS, I WANTED TO BE HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I BELIEVE WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR VOTE, BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT A PATH TOWARDS VICTORY IN THIS ELECTION RUNS STRAIGHT THROUGH MICHIGAN. SO I AM HERE TO SPEAK WITH YOU , BECAUSE YOU POSSESS AN ABILITY TO MAKE A DECISION IN THIS ELECTION THAT COULD IMPACT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. I'M HERE TO ALSO REMIND US, THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE , THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET IN THE WAY OF OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. YOU CAN LOOK AT HISTORY, WE KNOW THAT. WE KNOW WHY JOHN LEWIS SHED HIS GOD ON THE EDMUND , SHED HIS BLOOD ON THE EDMUND PETTIS BRIDGE TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO VOTE. WE JUST CELEBRATED WEEKS AGO THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT. BECAUSE THOSE SUFFRAGETTES FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT FOR WOMEN TO VOTE. BUT NOTE, WHICH IS MORE THAN A FOOTNOTE, BLACK WOMEN COULDN'T VOTE UNTIL 1965. WE KNOW THAT HISTORY, WE KNOW THE HISTORY THAT IN 2013, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT GUTTED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. WHEREIN, ALMOST TWO DOZEN STATES, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY PUT IN PLACE LAWS TO TRY AND SUPPRESS, OR PREVENT BLOCK PEOPLE FROM VOTING. STUDENTS FROM VOTING, INDIGENOUS PEOPLE FROM VOTING. THE EFFORT WAS SO OBVIOUS, THAT AS AN EXAMPLE, IN NORTH CAROLINA, THE COURT OF APPEAL WHEN THEY REVIEWED WHAT THAT STATE DID, SAID THAT THE STATE DID IT WITH, QUOTE, 'SURGICAL PRECISION' TO PREVENT BLACK FOLKS FROM VOTING. 2013, SHALL BE THE HOLDER , SHELBY V. HOLDER, THAT CASE. 2016, I SERVED ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, BELIEVE WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD. RUSSIA INTERFERED IN THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITH A MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN, WITH AN INTENT TO CAUSE THE AMERICAN PAPER TO DISTRUST ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PILLARS OF OUR DEMOCRACY WHICH IS OUR ELECTION SYSTEM. AND BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE BEING TOLD, THAT THEY WILL DO IT AGAIN. SO DETROIT, I THINK ALL OF THIS BEGS THE QUESTION, WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME TO PREVENT US FROM VOTING? WHY ARE THEY GOING THROUGH SO MUCH TROUBLE TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR CONFUSING FOR US TO VOTE? AND THE ANSWER IS, BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. SO LET US NOT LET ANYONE TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. LET US NOT LET ANYONE TAKE OUR POWER, THAT IS THE POWER OF OUR VOICE THROUGH OUR VOTE, FROM US. WE MUST VOTE, AND WE MUST VOTE EARLY. IN 48 HOURS, YOU CAN START VOTING HERE IN MICHIGAN. THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU VOTE EARLY YOU CAN REMIND FOLKS ALSO , THAT THEY HAVE 40 DAYS TO VOTE. WE'RE ASKING FOLKS TO MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE, LIKE PULL OUT YOUR CALENDAR AND MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE THAT THAT IS THE DAY YOU'RE , GOING TO VOTE. YOU CAN EVEN HAVE A CEREMONY ABOUT IT, HAVE A PARTY ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT. BUT LET'S MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE, BECAUSE THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME. ON SO MANY ISSUES, AND YOU HAVE A CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. TO VOTE JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO WILL RESTORE THE DIGNITY, THE STANDING, AND THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. MY FINAL POINT IS THIS, THIS MOMENT WILL PASS, AND YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS, THEY WILL LOOK AT US, EACH ONE OF US, THEY WILL LOOK IN HER EYES AND ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT? AND WHAT I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM, IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT, WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT IN THE PISTONS' BACKYARD, WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT WITH THE DETROIT YOUTH CHOIR AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE SENATOR AND THE MAYOR. WE WILL TELL THEM THAT WE WERE COMMITTED OVER THOSE 42 DAYS TO DOING EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO MAKING SURE WE VOTE AND EVERYONE WE KNOW VOTES AND IN THAT WAY, FIGHTS FOR THIS COUNTRY WE LOVE. THANK YOU, DETROIT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.",

         "Well, thank you, Deputy Commissioner Perez. Thank you for your leadership and thank you for your kind words, and thank you for your service to the nation. Will you all join me in thanking the Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection for the United States of America, Mr. Robert Perez? (Applause.) Thank you for all you do. To Director Rottman, Director Durst, to my friend Congressman Andy Harris, to all of you serving here at the Port of Baltimore in Customs and Border Protection: It is a great, great honor to be here with all of you today to say a very simple thank you. Thank you for your service. Thank you for all you do every day to ensure the flow of commerce and ensure the safety and security of the American people. Let's give CBP a round of applause here at the Port of Baltimore. (Applause.) It is remarkable to think about how long the Port of Baltimore has played a role in the life of this nation since even before this nation was founded. And it continues to play a vital role in the commerce of our nation today. And all of you involved in Customs and Border Protection here at the Port of Baltimore play a vital role in ensuring that that commerce happens , happens in a way that protects the interests and the wellbeing of the American people. And before I get started, let me bring greetings , for all the good words that the Deputy Commissioner said about me , let me bring greetings from a friend of mine, a great admirer of Customs and Border Protection, and a man who is absolutely committed to ensuring the safety and security of the American people and protecting the homeland and standing with all who protect it. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The work you do here every day saves lives. But we also recognize that you're on the frontlines. And the risk that you take in enforcing our laws sometimes comes with the ultimate price. And let me say, with the Deputy Commissioner here, we today join our hearts and our prayers with the family of Border Patrol Agent Donna Doss. She'll be laid to rest this afternoon in Taylor County, Texas. The tragic accident that claimed her life on duty is a reminder that all of you who serve, all of you who wear the uniform of Customs and Border Protection, do so in no small way that reflects that you've put our lives ahead of your own. And so we remember her and we remember her family today. As I said, I'm here to say thank you. But I'm also here to learn more about the work that each and every one of you do. The briefing that I just received from the senior leadership here was very impressive and a reminder of how you bring state-of-the-art technology and time-honored tried and true methods to ensure that the commerce that flows here flows here legally and flows here in a way that doesn't threaten the wellbeing of the American people. President Trump laid out a vision this last Tuesday before the Congress of the United States and the American people. He laid out a vision that we might choose American greatness. And let me say, each one of you have already made that choice. And I'm here to recognize that the state of our union is strong, the state of our union is safe because of the work of Customs and Border Protection. And you have our thanks. (Applause.) You know, the President and I , and, frankly, all of the American people , couldn't be more grateful for the work that you do every day. And you don't hear that thanks often enough, I expect. The character of all of you who wear the uniform came into high relief, particularly over the last month, when the President took such a strong stand for border security and we saw a government shut down for 35 days. We're grateful to all the federal employees and their families who continued to work during this difficult time. But standing before all of you, let me say, we're particularly grateful today to the men and women of CBP, DHS. You all stood tall, you stayed on your watch in the midst of that shutdown, you stayed on mission. And I want to say thank you to you and your families for standing your post and never letting down during those days. (Applause.) And as the Congress continues to negotiate, even at this very hour, it's about funding our Department of Homeland Security, this very agency, and your efforts. I want to promise you: The President and I are going to continue to work tirelessly to get you the resources and the support that you need to accomplish that mission for the sake of all of the American people. The men and women of DHS know firsthand how vitally important this mission is, and particularly those of you who work every day in Customs and Border Protection. You see firsthand the transnational criminal organizations in Mexico and Central America. The drug cartels that fuel their deadly trades represent unquestionably one of the greatest national security and public health threats in the United States of America. Last year, Customs and Border Protections seized more than 827,000 pounds of illegal drugs entering our country just at our southern border alone. Mexican and Central American drug cartels are the main wholesale providers of drugs to street gangs and dealers. And their deadly trade brings suffering to millions of American families. As the President said this past Tuesday, as you know full well, tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by illegal drugs that cross into our border, flood into our cities. Three hundred Americans die every week from heroin, 90 percent of which comes across our southern border. But all told , all told, in the efforts reflected here , nevertheless, nearly 200 people in America lose their lives to drug overdose every single day. The mission that you perform here and the President's determination to secure our southern border has an enormous impact on the wellbeing of the American people, the safety and security of our communities and our families. And I have to tell you, seeing the work that you do here, and seeing the cutting-edge technology that you utilize, gives me great confidence that, as we continue to support your work, we will continue to confront the flow of illegal drugs into America as never before. Cutting-edge technologies that I just was briefed on that detect and seize contraband brought into the country. It's remarkable to think of that non-intrusive inspective technology I just looked over; large-scale X-ray and gamma ray imaging, allowing you to look into shipping containers and commercial trucks. And I have to tell you, I just mentioned to the director, I was so impressed that your training is so precise that you'll look at the manifest, and if the X-ray scan doesn't actually look like the vehicle that's described on the manifest, you'll begin the inspection. Now, that's an attention to detail that would inspire any American. Portable and handheld devices that allow you to make sure that smaller contraband in cars and on individuals is caught as well. These technologies, we know, are force multipliers. And last year, they helped you stop nearly a quarter of a million pounds of narcotics from entering the country, as well as a million dollars in foreign currency. That is a record of success the Port of Baltimore CBP should be proud of, and so are we. Now, we also are impressed that , by the time-honored tradition , just diligence, carefulness. And I also witnessed the highly trained canine teams that are utilized here. I even got a playing card from Zombie. And I have to tell you, seeing the way that these canines are capable of detecting even the faintest signs of deadly drugs, radioactive materials, and stowaways is impressive indeed. And Customs and Border Protection has been in the forefront of canine training and detection from the very beginning. In fact, CBP just announced the largest fentanyl bust in history at the Nogales port of entry in Arizona. Thanks to CBP's canine team, we've prevented more than 250 pounds of fentanyl from entering our country and flooding our streets. That would be enough fentanyl to kill nearly one third of the population of the United States. I think that's worth a round of applause for Customs and Border Protection. (Applause.) You know, the Old Book says, if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. And I hope, if you hear nothing more from me today, you hear us , you're here to pay a debt of honor and a debt of respect to all of you who put in the long hours and do the tireless work that is saving lives. Whether it makes the front page of the newspaper or not, I want you to know, from the President on down, we know that your work here is vital to the safety and security of the American people, even as you facilitate the flow of commerce in our growing economy. And we're truly grateful. The truth though is, today, your jobs are as difficult and dangerous as ever with the security and humanitarian crisis that we face at our southern border. Every day that our southern border remains unsecured, it gives the very criminal syndicates and drug traffickers that you confront literally in the form of contraband and illegal drugs every day here in the Port of Baltimore , it gives them more resources and more ability to peddle their poison and destroy American lives and families. Now, I want to assure you , I want to assure you that you have the support of this President and our entire administration, and of the American people, as you go about your task. And I want you to make you a promise. I want to make you a promise that we're going to continue , we're going to continue to work to secure our border , north, south, east, and west. When it comes to our southern border, as the negotiations continue, we will not rest, we will not relent until our Customs and Border Protection have the technology, the personnel, and the barriers required to secure our border. We're going to build that wall, one way or another. I promise you. (Applause.) So thank you for the work you do here today. Thank you for taking time away from your busy workday to give me such a warm welcome. I look forward to being able to meet as many of you as time permits. But I really came here to learn more but also to say thanks and assure you of our ongoing support. And I'll assure you of one other thing: You know, each and every day, you put on that uniform , we know it's no ordinary job. You come here at the Port of Baltimore, and the nation is safer because of your diligence and your commitment. And so I want you to know that you have the gratitude and, I'm confident, the prayers of the American people as you stand in the gap for the safety and security of our people and our families and our communities. And on behalf of our President and on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to say to all of you who work so diligently every day here at the Port of Baltimore: Keep up the good work. Stay focused on your task at hand. Know that the American people are with you, and we're going to continue to fight to give you the resources you need to accomplish that mission. And we will confront illegal drugs and all of its consequences as never before. And with your help, and with God's help, we will make great progress in this nation. We will save lives. And America will be safer than ever before. Thank you very much. God bless you and your work. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)",

         "Well, thank you very much. Thank you to the Acting Adjutant General , Brigadier General Timothy Winslow. He is a great Hoosier, an aviator with more than 2,500 hours of flight time , a man who's dedicated 33 years of service in the Indiana National Guard. So let me encourage you to be at ease and give a big round of applause for your Acting Adjutant General. Thank you, General. (Applause.) Thanks for (inaudible). It is great to be back home again, especially to be at Camp Atterbury, with so many men and women, and citizen soldiers who have stepped forward to serve our state and our nation. I can tell you, I serve as Vice President of the United States today, but I will always count it among the highest honors of my life when, as your Governor, I was the Commander-in-Chief of the Indiana National Guard. America is proud of the Indiana National Guard. Give yourselves a round of applause. You really set the pace. (Applause.) You really do. We've got the Ironman unit here. We've got the Bulldog unit. And I know you all are getting ready to go downrange. And I just had to come by. I had to come by after a brief stop down in my hometown of Columbus just to say thank you. Thank you for your service. I want you also to say thank you to your families. How about a round of applause for the spouses, and the parents, and the family members that support you as you serve our nation? (Applause.) And before we get done clapping, let me give you one more chance , I'm going to be with him a little bit later today when I arrive back at the White House. But I know he would want me to extend his greetings and his gratitude to each and every one of you. So allow me to extend the great respect and the appreciation of your Commander-in-Chief , the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) I hope all my fellow Hoosiers here are as proud as I am of the support that this President and this administration have provided to our men and women in uniform. I'm proud to report to you that, under this administration , and, frankly, the strong bipartisan support in Congress , we've actually seen the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the largest pay raise for men and women in uniform in more than 10 years. We're standing by each and every one of you as never before. And my commitment to each one of you, as your Vice President and on behalf of our President, is we're going to continue to make sure that you have the resources, the support, the equipment, and the training to accomplish your mission and defend this nation. That's our promise to each and every one of you. (Applause.) And I don't have to tell all of you, as you prepare for a deployment downrange in the next several months, that you know , literally since that , since that , since the founding of our country, citizen soldiers have played a vital role. The National Guard has been a part of our national defense. But since that day 18 years ago that we remembered earlier this month, the National Guard and the Indiana National Guard have been at the tip of the spear, and many of you have already been downrange several different times, playing a vital role in the global war on terror. And it's remarkable to think that the role that each one of you played in those deployments has made an incredible difference. I'm told actually that, since September 11th, more than 15,000 Indiana Army National Guard and 3,500 Indiana Air Guard have supported the global war on terror through deployments overseas. And as we mark that 18th anniversary, let me just say: On behalf of a grateful nation, thank you to the Indiana National Guard, the Indiana Air Guard for what you've done to protect this nation for all those 18 years. Give yourselves another round of applause. You've made an incredible difference. (Applause.) You've also played a critical role. I have to tell you, since going back to Washington, D.C., I've been awfully proud to hear reports of the way the Indiana National Guard has stepped forward following hurricanes and major weather events and disasters. It just seems like every single time that these events take place in our communities, somebody pulls me aside in Washington, D.C., and says, 'You know, the Indiana National Guard was one of the first units down there making a difference.' And I couldn't be more proud of that. Now, this is a great group. There are, I'm told, 300 engineers here today; about 85 military police preparing to deploy into Afghanistan; the engineers to Kuwait. But each one of you has your own personal story. And I was particularly moved, as the son of a combat veteran and the father of a United States Marine, to know that there is a father-son unit getting ready to deploy. And I don't know , I got to find out from somebody if that's ever happened before in the history of the Indiana National Guard. But it just underscores the commitment of families in this state to our national defense. So would you join me in congratulating and thanking First Sergeant Brian Schultheis and Lieutenant Brett Schultheis? Where are you guys? Put your hands in the air. (Applause.) Thank you. I know how proud you are, and I know how nervous you are going downrange with your dad. I appreciate both of you, and I appreciate your family. And it really is amazing to see you all here today. As I mentioned, it was probably one of the greatest honors of my life when I was Commander-in-Chief of the Indiana National Guard as your governor. Thirteen thousand men and women. It's amazing to think Indiana is not the seventh-largest state in America, but we boast the seventh-largest National Guard in this country. And that says an awful lot about families in this state and the commitment to providing for the common defense. And so I just wanted to come by and really say two things. First and foremost, thank you for your service. Thank you for stepping up for Indiana and for America. And secondly, on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, I just encourage you: Take the opportunity to be ready, which is the motto of Camp Atterbury and has been for decades. Use this time of training to sharpen yourselves and be prepared to deploy and bring real excellence and professionalism to this effort. Be vigilant. Respect the unified chain of command. Trust your superiors. Trust your orders. Mind your people and mind your mission. And know that the American people are counting on you, because we know we can. You know, I stand before you today, and the last thing I would say to each one of you is, from the bottom of my heart , is just: Thank you. Thank you for stepping forward in this all-volunteer military. Thank you for being the citizen soldiers that the National Guard are here in Indiana and all across America. Know that you go with the confidence of you Commander-in-Chief. Know that you go with the gratitude of the people of Indiana and this nation. But also know that you go with the prayers of people all across this state. And be assured of that as you prepare for deployment, as you go downrange, that you will be carried by the prayers of the people of Indiana and the people of this country. We will pray every day that no harm would befall you, no danger would come near you, and that you would do your job protecting this nation and return home safe to your families. That, we will pray. So thank you very much. God bless the Indiana National Guard. God bless the Hoosier State. And God bless America. It's great to be home. (Applause.)",

         "HELLO. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE. THERE IS A REASON WHY HV YOU POSIT ARE DOING REALLY WELL. THEY WILL DO EVEN AT HER. I TELL YOU WHAT STOP , WHAT. YOU ARE MAKING YOUR FAMILY PROUD, MA'AM. I WANT TO THANK THE SPEAKERS AHEAD OF ME. SOON TO BE COMMISSIONER, JESSICA HOLMES, I KNOW YOU ARE HERE SOMEWHERE. STATE REPRESENTATIVE LOUIS IS HERE. AND A GREAT COACH. MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS WITH ME TODAY AND WENT TO A SCHOOL COACH LAWSON WENT TO FOR LITTLE WHILE IN WASHINGTON. SHE IS RECRUITING SOME OF THE GIRLS BASKETBALL TEAM FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER WENT TO SCHOOL. SHE SHOWED ME A VIDEO YOU WERE DOING WERE YOU MADE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN COMPETING IN THE HEART OF WINNING. YOU TALKED ABOUT WORKING HARD AND COMPETING. AND EVERYONE WORKS HARD BUT YOU SAID WORKING HARD IS ESSENTIAL BUT COMPETING IS EVEN MORE CONSEQUENTIAL. DID YOU COMPETE WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAD? COMPETING BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE IN WHAT IS AT THE OF WINNING >> , WINNING. MY GOOD FRIENDS WHO REPRESENT THE FIRST AND FOURTH DISTANT , DISTRICT WITH DECENCY AND HONOR CAN TELL YOU WE ARE DOING BOTH, WORKING HARD AND COMPETING LIKE WE NEVER DID BEFORE BECAUSE SO MUCH IS AT STAKE FOR THIS NATION. THE VERY SOUL OF THE NATION IS AT STAKE. AS MY COOK , AS MY FOLKS USED TO SAY IN COLLEGE, IT IS GO TIME. THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN OUR LIFETIME. THE CHOICE IS AS CLEAR AS IT HAS EVER BEEN AND STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION REMIND ME OF SOMETHING MY DAD USED TO SAY WHEN WE LOST IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, WHEN I WAS A KID. HE OWES USED TO SAY A JOB IS A LOT , ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, AND YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. HE SAID, AND THIS IS THE GODS TRUTH, IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY HONEY, IT WILL BE OK. THAT IS A LESSON I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN. I GREW UP AROUND A LOT OF HARD-WORKING FOLKS. HOW MANY PEOPLE TODAY THINK THEY COULD LOOK THERE KID IN THE EYE RIGHT NOW AND SAY, IT WILL BE OK, AND MEAN IT? SO MANY PEOPLE ARE HURT. OVER HALF OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA SAY THEY HAVE A BILL FOR $400 THEY DID NOT EXPECT IN ONE MONTH AND THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY IT. THEY EITHER BORROW MONEY OR SELL SOMETHING. AS UNEMPLOYMENT IS WAY UP. 1,000,200 THOUSAND PEOPLE FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT JUST THIS WEEK. FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING THE NEXT MORTGAGE PAYMENT, WHETHER HEALTH CARE WOULD BE RIPPED AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC, WORRYING ABOUT SENDING THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL OR NOT. THEY SEE FOLKS AT THE TOP DOING BETTER THAN EVER WHILE LEFT TO WONDER, WHO IS LOOKING OUT FOR ME? THAT IS DOWN FROM'S PRESIDENCY. MORE THAN 217,000 AMERICANS DEAD BECAUSE OF COVID-19. NEARLY 4000 IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA. ON FRIDAY, WE SAW THE HIGHS NUMBER OF NEW CASES IN ONE DAY SINCE JULY STOP IN THE LAST TWO DAYS, THE WORST DAY SINCE JULY. YES, THE OTHER NIGHT , YET, THE OTHER NIGHT, TRUMP SET AT ONE OF HIS RALLIES WE HAVE TURNED THE QUARTER , CORNER. MY GRANDFATHER WOULD SAY, THIS GUY IS AROUND THE BEND IF HE THINKS THAT. THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE. HE CONTINUES TO LIE TO US ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. EXPERTS SAY WE ARE LUCKY TO LOSE AS MANY AS 200,000 ADDITIONAL LIVES BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR ALL BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT CARES MORE ABOUT HIS PARK AVENUE PERSPECTIVE AROUND THE WORLD, THE STOCK MARKET, THEN HE DOES ABOUT YOU. HE REFUSES TO FOLLOW THE SCIENCE. IT IS ESTIMATED BETWEEN THE END OF THE YEAR , NOW IN THE END OF THE YEAR, 100,000 LIVES. HIS OWN HEAD OF THE CDC SAID THAT. WHAT IS SAD IS THE PRESIDENT KNEW HOW DANGEROUS THE VIRUS WAS ALL THE WAY BACK IN JANUARY. HE HIT IT FROM THE COUNTRY. HE IS ON RECORD. HE TOLD BOB WOODWARD IN A TAPED INTERVIEW THAT THE DISEASE WAS DEADLY AND MUCH WORSE THAN THE FLU AND HERE'S WHAT HE DID. ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES, THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO, I GAVE WALL STREET INVESTORS A HEADS UP BUT HE DID NOT TELL US. THAT IS WHY THEY MADE SO MUCH MONEY BY SELLING SHORT. YOU ALL GOT SOLD SHORT. YOU KNOW WHAT IS COMING? BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST OF US TRIED TO CLAIM WITH WOODWARD THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT PANIC. TRUMP PANICS. THE SELFISH BEHAVIORS NO SURPRISE. THIS IS THE SAME MAN WHO LOOKS AT AMERICANS WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR THE NATION, LIKE SO MANY TENS OF THOUSANDS IN NORTH CAROLINA HAVE DONE, LIKE MY SON DID WINNING A BRONZE STAR. HE CALLS THEM SUCKERS AND LOSERS. WHO THE HELL DOES HE THINK HE IS TALKING ABOUT? THESE ARE HEROES. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE SACRIFICING. THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ALL OF THE IRRESPONSIBLE ACTION, HOW MANY CHAIRS WERE EMPTIED AT THE TABLE LAST NIGHT BECAUSE OF THIS NEGLIGENCE? WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. DESPITE THE CRISIS WE FACE, WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY. WE COULD BUILD BACK BETTER. WE JUST HAVE TO STAND UP AND TAKE IT BACK. LOOK. WE CAN BUILD THE ECONOMY AND AN EQUAL CHANCE TO GET AHEAD. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN NORTH CAROLINA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THE QUESTION IS, IN THE GOOD TIMES COME YOU LAG BEHIND. THE ANSWER IS ABOUT JUSTICE. CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND POLICE REFORM. THIS NATION IS STRONG ENOUGH TO BE HONEST THAT WE FACE SYSTEMIC RACISM FOR THE FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT TOO OFTEN BEAR THE BRUNT OF LOOTING AND BURNING. WE HAVE NO NEED ROAMING THE AMERICANS , AMERICA'S STREETS. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WE SHOULD HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR AN EXTREMIST WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUP MARCHING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT IF YOU SAY WE HAVE NO , NO NEED TO FACE RACIAL INJUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU HAVE NOT HOPE , OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE TRUTH. THERE HAVE BEEN POWERFUL VOICES FOR JUSTICE IN RECENT MONTHS. GEORGE FLOYD'S SIX-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, I KNELT DOWN TO SAY HI TO HER AND SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, DADDY CHANGED THE WORLD. JACOB BLAKE'S MOTHER SAYS VIOLENCE DOES NOT REFLECT HER SON AND THE NATION NEEDS HEALING AND SHE SAID SHE PRAYS FOR POLICE OFFICERS. DOC RIVERS, A BASKETBALL COACH, CHOKING BACK TEARS WHEN HE SAID WE ARE THE ONES GETTING KILLED. WE ARE THE ONES GETTING SHOT. WE HAVE BEEN HUNG. IT IS AMAZING WHY WE KEEP LOVING THIS COUNTRY IN THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT LOVE US BACK. THINK ABOUT THAT, WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A BLACK PERSON, TO LOVE THE COUNTRY TODAY AS HE DOES, A DEEP LOVE FOR THE COUNTRY. WE NEED LEADERSHIP TO DE-ESCALATE TENSIONS, OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION, AND BRING US TOGETHER, TO HEAL AND TO HOPE. AS PRESIDENT, THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I WILL DO. TRUE JUSTICE IS ALSO ABOUT GOOD PAYING JOBS, FINANCIAL STABILITY. IT WAS RIGHT HERE A CENTURY AGO THAT AN OASIS OF BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES THRIVED. EVEN IN THE ERA OF JIM CROW. THE UNITED STATES WAS ONE OF THE FIRST EXAMPLES OF FLOURISHING BLACK MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS. A PLAYSET OFFERED THE GIVING FAMILIES A REAL SHOT AT A HOME, SEND A CHILD TO COLLEGE DEBT-FREE SO THEY COULD BUILD WEALTH AND PASS OPPORTUNITY DOWN. THEY BUILT EVERY OTHER MIDDLE-CLASS GROUP IN AMERICA. THAT IS HOW WE DELIVER EQUALITY AND EQUITY. ANOTHER EXAMPLE, MORE WOMEN ARE DROPPING OUT OF THE WORKFORCE IN THIS RECESSION, WHETHER IN CITIES OR SUBURBS. I HAVE A PLAN TO DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC RESPONSIBLY, TESTING, TRACING, MASKING, PLANNING FOR A SAFE AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION, PROVIDING FUNDING FOR PPE AND OTHER RESOURCES, FOR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN SAFELY. SO MANY FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING, SQUEEZED BETWEEN RAISING HER KIDS AND CARING FOR AN AGING LOVED ONE. PROTECTING YOUR HEALTH CARE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC, WHY THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THE TIME TO HOLD A HEARING ON THE SUPREME COURT INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE ECONOMIC NEEDS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I WILL TELL YOU WHY, FOR REAL. I WILL TELL YOU WHY. IT IS ABOUT WIPING OBAMACARE OFF THE BOOKS, THAT IS WHAT IT IS ABOUT. THEIR NOMINEE HAS SET IN THE PAST, THE LAW SHOULD BE STRUCK DOWN. IF THEY GET THEIR WAY, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE THEIR PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. COMPLICATIONS OF COVID-19, 7 MILLION PEOPLE INFECTED, WILL BECOME THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, ALLOWING INSURERS TO JACK UP YOUR PREMIUMS OR DENIED YOUR COVERAGE. WOMEN WILL BE CHARGED MORE FOR THEIR HEALTH JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN. FOLKS, WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER. I WILL BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE, YOU CAN CHOOSE THE MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION. WE ARE GOING TO LOWER YOUR PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING. YOUR GOVERNOR HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TO EXPAND MEDICAID, BUT IT IS BEING BLOCKED BY REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE. MY PLAN WILL INVOLVE 357,000 UNINSURED WITH CAROLINIANS IN A PUBLIC OPTION FOR FREE AUTOMATICALLY. IT IS GOING TO MAKE A LIFE-CHANGING DIFFERENCE FOR SO MANY FAMILIES. WE CAN ONLY DO ANY OF THIS IF WE COME TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY. WE NEED TO REVIVE THE SPIRIT A BIPARTISANSHIP, ESPECIALLY BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER. I SAID THAT FROM THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCED, I WAS TOLD, MAYBE WE USED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT, THAT WAS YOUR REPUTATION IN THE SENATE, BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED, THEY DON'T WORK THAT WAY ANYMORE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THEY CAN AND THEY WILL AND THEY MUST IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE IN AMERICA. FOLKS, I'M RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. NO RED STATES, NO BLUE STATES, JUST THE UNITED STATES. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DID, THAT IS THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT, A DUTY TO CARE FOR EVERYONE IN AMERICA. FOLKS, AND YOU TOO HAVE A SACRED DUTY, TO VOTE, AND IT MATTERS. NORTH CAROLINA MATTERS. SENATOR HARRIS AND I ARE ASKING YOU FOR YOUR TRUST AND SUPPORT. WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK, SO PLEASE VOTE AND HELP GET OUT THE VOTE. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM/NC. EARLY VOTING STARTED ON THURSDAY. WE HAVE TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING. WE CAN'T LET UP. YOU CAN VOTE EARLY IN PERSON UNTIL THE 31ST, BUT DON'T WAIT. GO VOTE TODAY AND DON'T JUST VOTE FOR ME AND SENATOR HARRIS, YOU HAVE A GOVERNORS RACE, SENATE RACE, A RECORD NUMBER OF BLACK WOMEN ON THE BALLOT, LABOR COMMISSIONERS, THE COURTS. FOLKS, THEY ARE READY TO DELIVER FOR NORTH CAROLINA FAMILIES, SO VOTE. IT IS TIME. WHEN I ANNOUNCE MY CANDIDACY, I HAD NOT PLANNED ON RUNNING AGAIN AND I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE, MY SON HAD JUST DIED AND I HAD NO INTEREST. THEN I SAW THOSE FOLKS COME OUT OF THE FIELDS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE CARRYING TORCHES. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE, THEIR VEINS BULGING, SHOUTING ANTI-SEMITIC BILE, THE SAME PILE THAT WAS SHOUTED IN THE STREETS OF GERMANY IN THE 1930'S, CARRYING NAZI FLAGS, ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN AND A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED WHO WAS PROTESTING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. WHEN ASKED FOR COMMENT, THIS PRESIDENT SAID SOMETHING NO OTHER PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID. HE SAID, THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. VERY FINE PEOPLE. I MEAN IT WHEN I SAY THIS. IT IS TIME TO RESTORE AMERICA'S SOUL. IT IS TIME TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA, THE MIDDLE CLASS, AND BRING EVERYBODY ALONG, NO MATTER YOUR RACE, AGE, RELIGION, GENDER, ETHNICITY, OR DISABILITY. WE CAN DO THIS. THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF, THEY HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED. IT IS TIME TO UNITE AMERICA. I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID WHEN I WAS A KID WHEN WE WERE GOING TO THE MOON. EVERY KID IN SCHOOL HURT HIS SPEECH. HE USED THE LINE IN THAT SPEECH, MY SENATE COLLEAGUES IN THE WHITE HOUSE HEARD ME USE ALL THE TIME, THAT MADE THE MOST IMPRESSION ON ME. HE ASKED, WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? HIS RESPONSE WAS, HE SAID, BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE. THIS IS AMERICA. WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE AMERICA'S WORK THAT MUST BE DONE. THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. WE HAVE NEVER, NEVER, NEVER MAILED HERE AND THERE IS NO LIMIT ON OUR FUTURE HERE IN , NEVER FAILED. THERE IS NO LIMIT ON OUR FUTURE. EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS, SO LET HIM DO WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION, SCIENCE OVER FICTION. AND YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES. FOLKS, IT IS TIME TO STAND UP AND TAKE BACK OUR DEMOCRACY. NO MORE TIME GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.",

         "THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. HELLO, LEMOORE. THE CAPTAIN, DOUG PETERSON, CAPTAIN AIDEN JASON, CAPTAIN BOBBY MARK A VAGUE. ALL OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES GATHERED HERE, HONORED GUESTS. THANKS FOR THE WARM WELCOME. THANKS FOR THE FLIGHT JACKET. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH THE SAILORS AT THE NAVY'S WEST COAST MASTER JET BASE NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE. AS MY WONDERFUL WIFE SAID, IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN STRIKE FIGHTER COUNTRY. BEFORE I BEGIN, I WANT TO ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN THANKING SOMEONE WHO HAS LITERALLY SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS SHOWING OUR APPRECIATION FOR PEOPLE LIKE THIS. THAT'S GREAT. SHE IS A MARINE CORPS MOM. SHE HAS TRAVELED THE NATION AND TRAVELED THE WORLD, COMING ALONGSIDE MILITARY SPOUSES. SHE SUPPORTED REFORMS AND LAWS CONCERNING AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING MILITARY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT. SHE WILL BE SPEAKING TO SPOUSES RIGHT HERE. AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF MY INCREDIBLE WIFE, WHO I THINK IS THE BEST SECOND LADY THE U.S. HAS EVER HAD. JOIN ME IN THANKING KAREN PENCE WHAT SHE HAS DONE FOR OUR TROOPS AND FAMILIES. THANK YOU. I'M HERE TO DELIVER A VERY SIMPLE MESSAGE. TO EACH AND EVERYONE ONE OF YOU. ON BEHALF OF YOUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, FROM YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, AND BEHALF OF EVERY AMERICAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AFTER TRAVELING ACROSS THIS COUNTRY FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS, I PROMISE YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE MORE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE THEN YOU WILL EVER KNOW. YOU COME FROM THE REST OF US, BUT WE KNOW, YOU ARE THE BEST OF US. AND WE ARE GRATEFUL. NOT ONLY TO THOSE OF YOU WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM, BUT AS WE HAVE MENTIONED A FEW MOMENTS ALREADY, WE ARE GRATEFUL TO ALL WHO STAND BESIDE YOU. SO MANY OF YOU SERVE EVERYDAY AS A FAMILY. WHILE YOU TRAIN AND DEPLOY, YOUR WIVES, YOUR HUSBANDS, THE PARENTS WHO KEEP THE HOME FIRES BURNING, ISN'T IT? WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OUR DAUGHTER, CHARLOTTE, AND OUR SON-IN-LAW ARE STATIONED RIGHT HERE AT NAS LEMOORE. WE COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD. OUR SON IS A MARINE CORPS F-35 PILOT. HE AND HIS WIFE ARE STATIONED IN ARIZONA. LIKE SO MANY OF YOU, THEY SERVE AS A FAMILY. AS WE EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE MEN AND WOMEN GATHERED BEFORE ME, AND ALL YOU REPRESENT, HOW ABOUT A BIGGER ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR ALL OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO SUPPORT ALL OF YOU WHO SERVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN UNIFORM? LET'S HEAR IT. IT IS INSPIRING TO LOOK OUT AND SEE ALL OF YOU TODAY. REMARKABLE TO THINK OF THE COUNTLESS AMERICAN HEROES WHO HAVE STOOD WHERE WE ARE ALL STANDING. OVER 60 YEARS, WARRIORS HAVE COME HERE, TRAINED HERE, GONE OUT FROM HERE AND DEPLOYED TO EVERY PLACE IN EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD. THIS INSTALLATION IS THE ONLY MASTER JET BASE OF THE NAVY, AND ALL OPERATIONAL, SPECIFICALLY STRIKE FIGHTER SQUADRONS. 16 OPERATIONAL STRIKE FIGHTER SQUADRONS, TWO FLEET REPLACEMENT SQUADRONS, ONE WEST COAST CARRIER AIR WING, COMMANDERS, AND STAFF. ON AVERAGE, MORE THAN 210,000 FLIGHT OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED RIGHT HERE FROM NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE EVERY YEAR. GIVE YOURSELVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE HISTORY AND TRADITION OF SERVICE. TWO AIR WINGS ARE CURRENTLY DEPLOYED, 11 ON THE USS TEDDY, NINE SQUADRONS, INCLUDING THE BLACK DIAMOND AND THE KNIGHTS STATIONED HERE. CARRIER AIR WING 17 IS DEPLOYED FOR THE NIMITZ. IT INCLUDES NINE SQUADRONS, INCLUDING F-18 SUPER HORNETS FROM HERE AT LEMOORE, FLOWN BY THE RED CROSS, THE CASTRO'S, AND THE MIGHTY STRIKES. HOW ABOUT A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR ALL OF THE NAS LEMOORE SQUADRONS DEPLOYED AROUND THE WORLD? WE ARE PROUD OF YOU ALL. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE SOAR ACROSS THE SKY IN DEFENSE OF OUR NATION AND FREEDOM. IT INSPIRES EVERY DAY. MANY PEOPLE WONDER ALL THEIR LIVES IF THEY HAVE EVER MADE A DIFFERENCE. YOU WILL NEVER HAVE THAT PROBLEM. YOU STEP FORWARD, JOIN THE ARMED FORCES, YOU BECAME PART OF THE GREATEST FORCE FOR GOOD THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN. YOU CHOSE TO DO YOUR PART IN YOUR TIME TO DEFEND THE FLAME OF FREEDOM AND HAND IT ON TO GENERATIONS YET TO COME. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GRATEFUL. THE BIBLE SAYS YOU DID NOT LOVE YOUR LIVES SO MUCH AS TO SHRINK FROM THIS CALLING. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU, YOU HAVE OUR DEEPEST RESPECTS FOR THE SELFLESSNESS AND COURAGE YOU PERSONIFY EVERY DAY. FOR FOUR YEARS, I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF BEING VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE WORKED EVERY DAY TO MAKE THE STRONGEST MILITARY FORCE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD STRONGER STILL. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT BY DEVASTATING BUDGET CUTS. . OUR TROOPS HADN'T SEEN A SIGNIFICANT PAY RAISE IN NEARLY 10 YEARS. ALMIRA TERRI , OUR MILITARY LACKED READINESS. OUR NATO ALLIES WERE NOT MEETING THEIR COMMITMENTS TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE. IRAN WAS RESURGENT ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION CONTROLLED A LANDMASS THE SIZE OF PENNSYLVANIA. I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE RESTORED THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE ENACTED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. WE ARE ONCE AGAIN GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, COAST GUARD, AND GUARDIANS OF THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT YOU DESERVE. WE PROVIDED FOR ACTIVE-DUTY PERSONNEL, THE LARGEST PAY RAISE IN NEARLY 10 YEARS, AND YOU DESERVE EVERY PENNY. OUR MILITARY IS NOW MORE EQUIPPED THAN EVER BEFORE. UNDER OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE SECURED NEARLY 500 F-35 FIGHTERS, 21 MORE DEPLOYABLE SHIPS, WITH ANOTHER 59 ON THE WAY. WE HAVE UPGRADED OUR TANKS, ARTILLERY, ROCKET SYSTEMS, BOLSTERED OUR FLEET OF ATTACK HELICOPTERS AND BROADER FIGHTER PLANES, AS WELL. WITH THAT STRONG COMMITMENT TO OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE, AND WILLINGNESS TO USE AMERICAN POWER TO ADVANCE AMERICAN SECURITY, OUR ALLIES HAVE ALSO STEPPED UP AS NEVER BEFORE. SINCE 2016, OUR NATO ALLIES HAVE INCREASED THEIR CONCH TRIBUTE , CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE BY MORE THAN $130 BILLION. HISTORY TEACHES WEAKNESS COMES OUT OF PEOPLE, AND OUR HISTORY HAS PROVEN A STRONG AMERICA DETERS IT. OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IF YOU WANT PEACE, PREPARE FOR WAR. WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE HAVE DEFENDED THIS NATION AND AMERICA'S VITAL INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS AND AROUND THE WORLD. WITH A FEW DAYS LEFT, I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION IN DECADES NOT TO GET AMERICA INTO A NEW WAR. BUT ALL ALONG THE WAY WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AND STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES. WE INSURED PEACE AND STABILITY. IT REQUIRES TWO THINGS, STRONG AMERICAN MILITARY AND WILLINGNESS TO ACT TO DEFEND AMERICA'S INTERESTS AROUND THE WORLD. UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE DONE JUST THAT. WE TOOK HISTORIC STEPS, FIRST TO STAND WITH OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLIES. WE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, THE CAPITOL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. WE RECOGNIZE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY OVER GOLAN HEIGHTS. AND AFTER 26 YEARS, FOUR ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST. AND UNDER OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE TAKEN THE FIGHT TO RADICAL ISLAM IT TERRORISTS ON OUR TERMS ON THEIR SOIL. DURING THESE LAST FOUR YEARS, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE U.S. CAPTURED THE LAST INCH OF TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY ISIS, AND A STRIKE FIGHTERS STATIONED RIGHT HERE AT NAS LEMOORE WERE IN THE FIGHT EARLY ON, HITTING ISIS, GIVING TERRORISTS NO QUARTER, DRIVING THEM FROM THEIR STRONGHOLDS. WITH THE COURAGE OF OUR ARMED FORCES, I'M PROUD TO REPORT MORE THAN A YEAR AGO, WE CRUSHED THEIR CALIPHATE, CAPTURED THE LAST INCH OF TERRITORY UNDER THE BLACK FLAG OF ISIS, AND TOOK DOWN THEIR LEADER WITHOUT ONE AMERICAN CASUALTY. AND WE STOOD UP TO THE LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR. DRAWING FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, WE STRENGTHENED OUR ALLIANCES IN THE REGION AND ISOLATED IRAN AS NEVER BEFORE. AND WHEN THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD THREATENED AMERICAN FORCES IN THE REGION, OUR ARMED FORCES TOOK ACTION AND IRAN'S TOP GENERAL, BECAUSE SOME SOLEIMANI, IS GONE. THANKS TO AMERICAN LEADERSHIP, A MORE PEACEFUL MIDDLE EAST IS WITHIN OUR SITES. AND WITH RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE EMBRACE OUR ROLE AS LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. WHETHER IT BE IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR OR MANNING THE RAMPARTS OF FREEDOM IN EUROPE, OR THE ASIA-PACIFIC, THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE U.S. NAVY HAVE BEEN THAT GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. A STRONG AND READY NAVY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. AS A NEW AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION PREPARES TO TAKE OFFICE, WE DO WELL TO REMEMBER AS AMERICANS THAT THE PRICE OF FREEDOM IS ETERNAL VIGILANCE, AND A FREE AND OPEN INDO PACIFIC IS IMPORTANT TO OUR PROSPERITY, SECURITY, AND VITALITY OF FREEDOM OF US THE WORLD. AFTER GENERATIONS WHERE AMERICA AND OUR ALLIES DEFENDED THE FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION AND THE INTERESTS OF FREE NATIONS ACROSS THE ASIA-PACIFIC, TODAY, THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS DETERMINED TO EXPAND BEIJING'S INFLUENCE ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH MILITARY PROVOCATIONS AND DEAD DIPLOMACY. SO I URGE THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION TO STAY THE COURSE. DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE. STAND UP TO CHINESE AGGRESSION, AND TRADE ABUSES. STAND STRONG FOR A FREE AND OPEN INDO PACIFIC AND PUT AMERICA AND OUR FREEDOM LOVING ALLIES FIRST. AND I KNOW THE U.S. NAVY WILL CONTINUE TO STAND STRONG. IN THE INDO PACIFIC AND ALL OVER THE WORLD. IN THE YEARS AHEAD, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE FREE WORLD WILL RELY ON THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. NAVY MORE THAN EVER TO SAFEGUARD THE FREE AND OPEN FLOW OF COMMERCE AND OUR IDEALS ON THE SEVEN SEAS. SO ON BEHALF OF YOUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, LET ME OFFER YOU THIS ADMONITION. IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES ACROSS THE WIDER WORLD, BE VIGILANT. MIND YOUR MISSION. RESPECT THE UNIFIED CHAIN OF COMMAND. TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. NEVER DOUBT THAT EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE, EVERY ACTION YOU TAKE, MATTERS TO THE SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. GIVE AMERICA YOUR BEST EVERY DAY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON YOU. BECAUSE WE KNOW WE CAN. AS YOU STAND AT POST, I CAN ASSURE YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE BEHIND YOU 100%. SO AS I CLOSE, LET ME SAY AGAIN, ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY AND A GRATEFUL NATION, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AMERICA IS THE FREEST AND STRONGEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND YOU SECURE THAT FREEDOM. AND YOU ARE THAT STRENGTH. YOU STEP FORWARD IN A CALLING WERE YOU DECIDED TO COUNT OUR LIVES AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR OWN. JUST LIKE GENERATIONS THAT HAVE GONE BEFORE, YOU DID SO KNOWING THE SAILOR AND THE SOLDIER DO NOT BEAR THE SWORD IN VAIN. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE RISK YOU TAKE EVERY DAY. BUT KNOW THIS. YOU DO NOT BEAR THAT BURDEN ALONE. WHEREVER YOU ARE CALLED TO SERVE, WHEREVER YOU ARE DEPLOYED, I PROMISE YOU, YOU WILL CARRY WITH YOU THE STRENGTH AND PRIDE OF THIS NATION, AND THE PRAYERS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. THERE WILL PRAY IN THE ANCIENT WORDS OF THE PSALMISTS THAT NO HARM WILL BEFORE YOU, NO DISASTER WILL COME NEAR YOUR TENT, THAT AS YOU SERVE HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD, THAT HIS FAITHFULNESS WILL BE YOUR SHIELD. YOU ARE THE STRENGTH AND THE PRIDE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND A SOURCE OF GREAT PRIDE TO OUR FAMILY. AND WHETHER YOU SERVE ON LAND, AT SEA, OR IN THE SKIES ABOVE, JUST KNOW THAT EVERY DAY, IN HOMES LARGE AND SMALL AROUND DINNER TABLES AND GATHERINGS, AND IN QUIET MOMENTS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PRAY FOR EACH AND EVERYONE. GIVE THANKS FOR YOUR SELFLESS COURAGE, AND WISH YOU FARIR WINDS AND FOLLOWING SEAS. THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING WITH YOU TODAY. AS MY TIME IN OFFICE DRAWS TO A CLOSE, ALLOW ME TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT THESE PAST FOUR YEARS. IT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE. AND IT HAS BEEN A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE TO SERVE MEN AND WOMEN LIKE ALL OF YOU, MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES. I TRULY BELIEVE AS LONG AS WE HAVE MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU, WITH THE COURAGE AND SELFLESSNESS TO STEP FORWARD AND SERVE, AS LONG AS WE HAVE HEROES WILLING TO PUT YOUR LIVES ON THE LINE, AS LONG AS WE HAVE PATRIOTS WILLING TO DEFEND OUR NATION, I KNOW OUR COUNTRY WILL BE SAFE. OUR FREEDOM WILL BE SECURE, AND THE BEST DAYS FOR THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH ARE YET TO COME. SO MAY GOD BLESS THE MEN AND WOMEN OF NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE HERE AND DEPLOYED. GOD BLESS YOU AND HIS PROTECTION, AND WITH THAT FIGHTER SPIRIT. MAY GOD BLESS ALL THOSE SERVING IN OUR ARMED FORCES. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.",

         "SENATOR DAVID PERDUE, FUTURE SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER, FORMER GOVERNOR SONNY PERDUE, REFORM N.C. NATIONAL COMMITTEE WOMAN GINGER HOWARD, YOUR GREAT STATE PARTY G.O.P. CHAIR DAVID SCHAEFERING, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE PEACH STATE. GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA THAT'S GOING TO HOLD THE LINE FOR AMERICA. CROWD CHANTING: HOLD THAT LINE! HOLD THAT LINE! IT IS GOOD TO SEE SO MANY FRIENDS. THANKS FOR COMING OUT ON THIS WARM AND BALMY DAY. YOU ARE ONE HARDY BUNCH. I SEE THAT LOOK OF VICTORY IN YOUR EYES. GOOD TO BE WITH SO MANY FRIENDS. SPEAKING OF FRIENDS OF MINE, ALLOW ME TO BRING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE. I WAS TALKING TO HIM ON THE PHONE THIS MORNING. TOLD HIM I WAS HEADED TO THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA. AND HE WANTED ME TO TELL YOU ALL THAT HE HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING EVERY DAY TO KEEP THE PROMISES THAT WE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA. I BRING GREETINGS FROM THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP! YOU KNOW, WITH YOUR SUPPORT, PRESIDENT AND I ARE SEVED MORE THAN 74 MILLION VOTES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. 10 MILLION MORE THAN 2016. THE GREATEST SHARE OF MINORITY VOTES IN THE LAST 60 YEARS AND WE ADDED MORE THAN A DOZEN SEATS TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. AND I AM HERE BECAUSE I STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. AND I'M HERE BECAUSE WE STAND WITH SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR EVERY LEGAL VOTE IN AMERICA. AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING TO HOLD THE LINE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. WE'RE GOING TO WIN GEORGIA AND WE'RE GOING TO SAVE AMERICA. CROWD CHANTING: HOLD THAT LINE! HOLD THAT LINE! HOLD THAT LINE! IT'S WHY I'M HERE. IT'S WHY THESE GREAT SENATORS AND SUPPORTERS LIKE YOU ARE OUT HERE. I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU ALL CAME OUT TODAY, I TRULY AM. TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU, I'LL MAKE YOU A PROMISE. AS OUR ELECTION CONTEST CONTINUES, IN COURTHOUSES ACROSS THE LAND, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING UNTIL EVERY LEGAL VOTE IS COUNTED. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING UNTIL EVERY ILLEGAL VOTE IS THROWN OUT. AND WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. DAVID! DAVID! DAVID! SO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I SUPPORT YOUR TWO SENATORS BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE. BUT WE ALSO ARE HERE JUST LIKE YOU ARE, BECAUSE OF ALL THAT WE DID TOGETHER. SERVING TOGETHER IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THINK ABOUT IT. FOUR YEARS AGO WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT BY RECKLESS BUDGET CUTS. AN ECONOMY STRUGGLING TO BREAK OUT OF THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. TERRORISM WAS ON THE RISE. AND WE WITNESSED THE STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR MOST CHERISHED VALUES. BUT WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE REVIVED OUR ECONOMY. WE SECURED OUR BORDER, STOOD WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND FOUGHT FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! I MEAN, JUST INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. BEING HERE, HOME TO FORT BENNING , I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO REPORT TO YOU, WITH THESE SENATORS' STRONG SUPPORT, WE'VE RESTORED THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. WE'RE FINALLY GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES AND COAST GUARDS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. IT'S TRUE. AND NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATOR DAVID PERDUE ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. THANK YOU, SENATOR. AND THE LAST ADMINISTRATION SAW YEARS OF SCANDAL AT THE V.A. YOU REMEMBER. SCANDAL THAT SHOCKED THE COP SHENS OF THE NATION , CONSCIENCE OF THE NATION. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME INTO OFFICE, WITH THE SUPPORT OF YOUR TWO SENATORS, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACTUALLY SIGNED THE MOST SWEEPING REFORMS IN THE V.A. IN 50 YEARS. WE FIRED 5,000 V.A. EMPLOYEES THAT WEREN'T GIVING OUR VETERANS THE CARE THAT THEY EARNED AND VETERANS' CHOICE IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR EVERY VETERAN IN AMERICA. AND FROM HER SEAT ON THE VETERANS' AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER WAS THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. AND AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY IN SOME 75 YEARS, WITH THE SUPPORT OF GEORGIA SENATORS, THIS PRESIDENT REVIVED OUR ECONOMY. WE CUT TAXES. WE ROLLED BACK REGULATIONS. WE FOUGHT FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE, UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY, AND IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED SEVEN MILLION GOOD-PAYING JOBS, INCLUDING 350,000 JOBS RIGHT HERE IN THE PEA STATE. WITH THE SUPPORT OF YOUR TWO SENATORS IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS, WE HAD A BLUE COLLAR BOOM GOING. THEN THE CORONAVIRUS STRUCK FROM CHINA. WITH THE SOLID FOUNDATION THAT WE POURED AND WITH THEIR SUPPORT EVERY DAY, WE LAUNCHED THE GREATEST NATIONAL MOBILIZATION SINCE WORLD WAR II. WE REINVENTED TESTING, WE SAW TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF BILLIONS OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO HOSPITALS AND NURSES. WE PROVIDED SUPPORT DIRECTLY TO FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES IMPACTED. IT'S REMARKABLE TO THINK, AFTER LOSING 22 MILLION JOBS AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, WITH THAT FOUNDATION THAT WE POURED, WE'VE ALREADY SEEN 12 MILLION AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK. WE'RE OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN. AND WHILE THE OTHER SIDE SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE, WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF YOUR TWO SENATORS, THIS WEEK AMERICA WITNESSED THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. WE MADE HISTORY AND THE FIRST CORONAVIRUS VACCINE IS BEING ADMINISTERED IN EVERY STATE IN THE UNION. AND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER WERE THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY PUTTING THE HEALTH OF GEORGIA FIRST. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE RULE OF LAW, AND OUR MOST CHERISHED LIBERTIES, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE WITH A PRESIDENT AND TO STAND WITH TWO SENATORS WHO HAVE HELPED US APPOINT MORE THAN 220 CONSERVATIVES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS. AND THEY'RE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION. THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. IT'S AMAZING TO THINK, NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE CONSIST SUPPORT OF SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER. IT WAS GEORGIA'S SENATORS WHO WERE THERE. ALL ALONG THE WAY. WHEN WE CONFIRMED MORE THAN 200 JUDGES, AND WHEN WE CONFIRMED THREE JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT, INCLUDING JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT. YOU KNOW, YOU REMEMBER UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, OUR VALUES AND OUR FREEDOMS WERE UNDER REGULAR ASSAULT. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION TRAMPLED THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES OF AMERICANS ON A REGULAR BASIS. THEY COMPROMISED THE CONSCIENCE RIGHTS OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND RELIGIOUS CHARITIES. THEY EVEN HAULED A GROUP OF NUNS KNOWN AS THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR INTO FEDERAL COURT TO FORCE THEM TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH, TO LIVE UNDER THE MANDATES OF OBAMACARE. IN FACT, WE SAW THAT RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE TWO YEARS AGO WHEN AMY CONEY BARRETT WAS UP FOR HER FIRST SEAT ON THE COURT OF APPEALS. YOU REMEMBER IT? THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ACTUALLY SAID SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AMY CONEY BARRETT'S CHRISTIAN FAITH. SHE SAID, AND I QUOTE, THE DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY WITHIN YOU. AND HOLLYWOOD LIBERALS HAVE BEEN ATTACKING JUDGE BARRETT EVER SINCE. WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON. AND THEIR FRIENDS IN HOLLYWOOD. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN ME. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN YOU. AND THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND WORSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF OUR FAITH LIVES LOUDLY IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SO FOR OUR LIBERTIES, FOR OUR FREEDOMS, WE NEED SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER BACK IN THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. THE CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER. WHERE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER STAND FOR A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE, THE OPPONENTS ARE GOING TO CUT OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE TO FUND THEIR BIG GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. YOU JUST WATCH. WHERE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER CUT TAXES, THE OTHERS WANT TO RAISE TAXES. ON WORKING FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES HERE IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. AND AS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN, WARNOCK IS ON TAPE CALLING MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE GANGSTERS JUST FOR VOTING TO CUT TAXES ON FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES IN THE PEACH STATE. AND WHERE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER SUPPORT OUR MILITARY, I MEAN, RADICAL LIBERAL WARNOCK ALONE HAS DEMEANED OUR MILITARY. HE'S REPEATEDLY DEFENDED THE ANTI-SEMITIC RHETORIC OF REVEREND JEREMIAH WRIGHT. IN FACT, RAFAEL WARNOCK CALLED OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLY, THE STRONG DEMOCRATIC JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL, AN APARTHEID STATE. AND HE COMPARED THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO EAST GERMAN STORM TROOPERS. WELL, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF KELLY LOEFFLER AND DAVID PERDUE TO SERVE ALONGSIDE OF A PRESIDENT WHO MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM. AND HAS STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL. AND WHERE JOHN AND WARNOCK SUPPORT ABORTION ON-DEMAND, AND TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, DAVID PURDUE , PERDUE, KELLY LOEFFLER, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE WILL ALWAYS STAND FOR THE RIGHT TO LIFE. YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THE STAKES ARE HERE IN GEORGIA. CHUCK SCHUMER SAID IT THE OTHER DAY. COULDN'T BE CLEARER. HE SAID, NOW WE TAKE GEORGIA, THEN WE CHANGE AMERICA. WELL, LET'S SEND A MESSAGE TO CHUCK SCHUMER AND THOSE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GEORGIA, WE'RE GOING TO SAVE THE SENATE, THEN WE'RE GOING TO SAVE AMERICA. YOU KNOW, I SAW JOE BIDEN WAS IN ATLANTA JUST THE OTHER DAY. HE SAID THAT WE DIDN'T NEED TO SEND KELLY LOEFFLER AND DAVID PERDUE BACK TO WASHINGTON. BECAUSE HE SAID WE DON'T NEED TWO SENATORS THAT ARE, QUOTE, JUST GOING TO GET IN THE WAY. WELL, GEORGIA, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. WE NEED DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER TO GET IN THE WAY OF HIGHER TAXES! WE NEED DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER TO GET IN THE WAY OF OPEN BORDERS, SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, A GREEN NEW DEAL, ARE YOU WITH ME? WE NEED TWO GEORGIA SENATORS WHO WILL GET IN THE WAY OF THE RADICAL AGENDA OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND FIGHT FOR GEORGIA EVERY DAY. THAT'S WHY WE NEED GEORGIA TO SAY NO TO THEM AND YES TO DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER. ON JANUARY 5. AS I CAME HERE TODAY, WITH ONE MESSAGE. IT ALL COMES DOWN TO GEORGIA. SO STAY IN THE FIGHT. STAY IN THE FIGHT FOR INTEGRITY IN OUR ELECTIONS. STAY IN THE FIGHT TO DEFEND THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. UNTIL UNTIL , UNTIL THE POLLS CLOSE ON JANUARY 5, YOU STAY IN THE FIGHT UNTIL WE SEND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER BACK TO WASHINGTON, D.C. WE NEED TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT.

BRING A NEIGHBOR. AND VOTE TO HOLD THE LINE, GEORGIA! DO IT TODAY! NOW I KNOW WE'VE ALL GOT DOUBTS ABOUT THE LAST ELECTION. THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO KEEP RIGHT ON FIGHTING. BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU. I HEAR SOME PEOPLE SAYING DOWN HERE IN GEORGIA, YOU'RE FRUSTRATED ABOUT THE LAST ELECTION, JUST DON'T VOTE. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, I SAY FROM MY HEART, YOU GOT TO REMEMBER, IF YOU DON'T VOTE, THEY WIN. IF YOU DON'T VOTE, THERE COULD BE NOTHING TO STOP CHUCK SCHUMER AND NANCY PELOSI FROM ADVANCING THEIR RADICAL LEFT AGENDA. CUTTING THE MILITARY, RAISES TAXES, TRAMPLING ON OUR VALUES. SO FOR ALL WE'VE DONE AND FOR ALL WE HAVE YET TO DO, FOR OUR PRESIDENT, FOR OUR FUTURE, FOR GEORGIA AND FOR AMERICA, CAST ANOTHER VOTE FOR ALL THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACCOMPLISHED, CAST THE VOTE TO SENT , SEND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER BACK TO WASHINGTON, D.C. AND I PROMISE YOU WE WILL KEEP FIGHTING. WE CAN FIGHT FOR OUR PRESIDENT. AND WE CAN FIGHT FOR MORE REPUBLICANS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AT THE SAME TIME. WE'VE BEEN DOING BOTH AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP DOING BOTH. AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. SO HERE'S THE DEAL, GEORGIA. IT MIGHT ALL COME DOWN TO YOU. SO, GEORGIA, WE NEED YOU TO STEP UP. AND I GOT A FEELING LOOKING AT ALL YOU HEARTY PEOPLE OUT HERE, THIS LOOKS LIKE A WIN COMING ON JANUARY 5 TO ME. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU. BECAUSE I GOT TO SAY, I GOT FAITH. I TRULY DO. IN MY HOUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS. BUT WE KNOW WHO HOLDS THE FUTURE. SO WHILE YOU GET OUT THERE EVERY DAY AND REMEMBER, RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE WAL-MART AND THE PIZZA HUT YOU CAN GO VOTE TODAY. YOU GET OUT AND VOTE, YOU GET YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS OUT TO VOTE. YOU TALK TO EVERYBODY ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT IS ON THE LINE AND WHY GEORGIA NEEDS TO HOLD THE LINE. I'D ENCOURAGE YOU, IF YOU HAVE A MIND TO BOW THE HEAD AND BEND THE KNEE FROM TIME TO TIME, NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO DO IT. I TRULY DO BELIEVE. I TRULY DO BELIEVE THAT IN THIS CHALLENGING TIME IN THE LIFE OF OUR NATION, IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. FOR US TO GO TO THAT WELL SPRING OF STRENGTH THAT HAS SEEN OUR PEOPLE THROUGH MUCH MORE CHALLENGING TIMES, EVEN IN WHICH WE LIVE TODAY. AND WHEN YOU PRAY, PRAY WITH CONFIDENCE. CLAIM THAT ANCIENT VERSE. THAT IF HIS PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLED BY HIS NAME WILL HUMBLE THEMSELVES AND PRAY AND TURN, THAT HE'LL DO LIKE HE'S ALWAYS DONE. IN THE LONG AND STORIED HISTORY OF AMERICA, HE'LL HEAR FROM HEAVEN AND HE'LL HEAL THIS LAND. THIS ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. SO PRAY FOR AMERICA. PRAY, GEORGIA. IT WILL MATTER. AND I JUST KNOW, IF ALL OF US DO ALL THAT WE NEED TO DO BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY 5, TO VOTE, TO SPEAK UP, AND TO PRAY, I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT VICTORY ON JANUARY 5. WHEN GEORGIA SENDS DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER BACK TO A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, GEORGIA WILL HAVE DONE MORE THAN YOUR PART. TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT. SO WITH CONFIDENCE IN ALL OF YOU , WITH CONFIDENCE IN THESE TWO GREAT SENATORS AND ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,, LET'S GO GET IT DONE, GEORGIA. LET'S SEND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER BACK TO WASHINGTON, D.C.",

         "IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. IT'S SOMETHING I'VE WANTED TO DO, I WAS HERE FOUR YEARS AGO IN SOME LITTLE BALLROOM THAT HELD ABOUT 400 PEOPLE, AND I SAID, I WANT TO BE WITH THE VILLAGES. GO OUT AND GET A FEEL. GO OUT AND GET A FEEL AND THAT'S WHAT THEY D. THEY GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE AND I SEE YOU DRIVING AROUND IN THOSE BEAUTIFUL GOLF CARTS, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CARTS. I WANT TO GET ONE. I'M GOING TO GET A GOLF CART LIKE THAT BUT YOU HAVE THE BEST AND YOU'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING FOR ME AND I'M ALWAYS FIGHTING FOR YOU AND I APPRECIATE IT. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. WE HAD AN EXCITING NIGHT LAST NIGHT WITH SLEEPY JOE. BUT I'M ALWAYS HERE TO LOVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND OUR NATION AND SENIORS. NOT ALL OF YOU ARE SENIORS. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY YOUNG. AND I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE YOUNG AT HEART, RIGHT? YOUNG AT HEART, ALL OF US. AND THE TIMELESS VALUES THAT MAKE THIS NATION THE GREATEST NATION ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 11 DAYS FROM NOW WE'RE GOING TO WIN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. WE'RE GOING TO WIN FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I THINK JOE BIDEN PROVED LAST NIGHT THAT HE'S NOT CAPABLE OF BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE COUNTRY SAW FIRST HAND THAT THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A TRUMP RECOVERY, AND I'LL CALL IT BECAUSE THIS ONE IS HAPPENING, IT'S A TRUMP SUPER RECOVERY, AND A BIDEN DEPRESSION BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE A DEPRESSION. WHO HAS 401-K'S IN THIS GROUP, ANYBODY? HE GOT 401-K, IT'S GOING DOWN THE TUBES. IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN OPTIMISM, PATRIOTIC VISION FOR AMERICAN SUCCESS, OR JOE BIDEN'S DARK, DISMAL, GLOOMY DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID ABOUT LAST NIGHT? DARKNESS, DARKNESS, ALWAYS DARKNESS, BUT IT'S A GLOOMY VISION. WE'RE ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM. ALL ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM. GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. JOE BIDEN IS TOTALLY CONTROLLED BY THE RADICAL SOCIALIST LEFT THIS COUNTRY WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. NEVER. ONE OF THE MOST STUNNING MOMENTS LAST NIGHT WAS WHEN JOE BIDEN ADMITTED THAT HE WANTS TO ABOLISH THE OIL INDUSTRY. THAT WASN'T TOO GOOD. DID YOU SEE HIM THIS MORNING? I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN THAT, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT. THAT WAS THE LAST QUESTION, THEY TALKED ABOUT THAT, WHOA, THIS IS THE BIG POINT OF THE EVENING. REMEMBER, I SAID, YOU WANT TO GET RID OF OIL AND GAS? IS THAT WE WANT TO PHASE IT OUT. I SAID, THANK YOU, TEXAS, ARE YOU WATCHING? PENNSYLVANIA. OKLAHOMA. OHIO, ARE YOU WATCHING? NOW THEY ARE GOING AROUND, HARRIS, SHE'S GOING AROUND, NO, WE WANT TO KEEP IT. SHE'S AGAINST FRACKING. IF THEY GET INTO ENERGY WE HAVE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE RIGHT NOW, THEY WILL END IT VERY QUICKLY. YOU KNOW, THAT WAS ONE WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT BUT THAT COULD BE ONE OF THE WORST MISTAKES MADE IN PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE HISTORY. WE'RE GOING TO SEE. WE HOPE IT IS. THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST SHOCKING ADMISSION EVER MADE DURING A DEBATE WHERE HE GOES IN AND HE SAYS, NO FRACKING BUT HE'S BEEN SAYING IT. NO FRACKING, HE GOT THE NOMINATION, ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE'S FRACKING. NO FOSSIL FUELS AND NO GAS-POWERED CARS. ULTIMATELY LET'S NOT HAVE CARS. LET'S GET RID OF AIRPLANES. HOW ABOUT THAT SENATOR FROM HAWAII, WHERE SHE WENT ALONG WITH THE GREEN NEW DEAL. SHE SAID YES, I'M IN FAVOR BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE AIRPLANES IN A GREEN NEW DEAL AND SHE'S IN HAWAII. SHE SAID, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU. MAYBE WE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE TO HAWAII INSTEAD. SHE'S A BEAUTY, ISN'T SHE? . BIDEN'S PLAN WOULD BE AMERICAN SENIORS WOULD HAVE NO AIR CONDITIONING DURING THE SUMMER. NO HEAT DURING THE WINTER, AND NO ELECTRICITY DURING PEAK HOURS. IT'S TRUE. HE WANTS WIND. WHEN THE WIND DOESN'T BLOW, LET'S WATCH THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT, DARLING, ON TELEVISION. I'M SORRY, WE CAN'T. THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING TONIGHT. LAST NIGHT, BIDEN PLEDGED TO INSTITUTE THE MOST HORRIBLE AND DANGEROUS IMMIGRATION POLICY EVER IN THIS COUNTRY, CATCH AND RELEASE. HE WANTS TO BRING IT BACK. IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS TO GET RID OF IT. THAT'S WHERE YOU CATCH A CRIMINAL, COULD BE A RAPIST, COULD BE A MURDERER, A REAL CRIMINAL, AND YOU JUST RELEASE THE CRIMINAL AND SAY, PLEASE COME BACK IN FOUR YEARS. DUR SEE WHAT HE SAID LAST NIGHT? HE SAID, THEN THEY COME BACK. I SAID, NO, THEY DON'T COME BACK JOE. 1%. HE SAID THEY COME BACK. NO, I SAID, JOE, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THEY DON'T COME BACK. THIS IS A VERY BAD POLICY, JOE. THEY DON'T COME BACK. THEY NEED PERRY MASON BUT THEY DON'T GET PERRY MASON. CRIMINALS AND RAPISTS AND EVEN MURDERERS ARE SET FREE. THEY ARE SET FREE INTO OUR COUNTRY. IT'S ENDED NOW. IT WAS VERY HARD TO GET ENDED. WHAT I HAD TO DO TO END IT I WILL NOT TELL YOU. I'LL NOT TELL THE PEOPLE OF THE VILLAGES. I WON'T TELL THE PEOPLE OF THE VILLAGES. BY THE WAY, YOU LOVE IT HERE, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S A POPULAR IT'S AN INCREDIBLY POPULAR PLACE. I SEE IT SO MUCH. IT'S INCREDIBLE. THE LOVE, THE SPIRIT. DID YOU LOVE THE PEOPLE THAT DEVELOPED IT? I THINK SO RIGHT? IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEBODY, BUT THAT WASN'T THE SAME LOVE AS YOU HAD NO, SOMEBODY DID A GOOD JOB, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LOOK AT THIS GUY. LOOK. BEAUTIFUL. LOOK. IT'S UNCLE SAM. COME HERE, UNCLE SAM. LOOK AT THIS GUY. LOOK. THIS IS A HELL OF A DAY, MR. CONGRESSMAN. HOW ARE YOU? WHEN ARE YOU GETTING MARRIED? ARE YOU GETTING MARRIED SOON? DON'T LOSE HER, YOU WOULD BE VERY DEPRESSED. BIDEN SAYS AMERICA IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN IDEA, RIGHT? HE ALSO SAID, DIDN'T HE SAY ANTIFA IS JUST AN IDEA, TOO. SO HE'S SAYING, ONLY AT THE VILLAGES COULD YOU SAY THIS. NO, HE SAID AMERICA WAS AN IDEA BUT COME TO THINK OF IT, HE SAID ANTIFA IS AN IDEA, TOO, RIGHT? WELL, AMERICA IS NOT AN IDEA. IT'S A GREAT COUNTRY. OKAY. GREAT COUNTRY. AMERICA IS OUR HOME. IT'S A NATION AND IT'S A NATION THAT HAS BORDERS, YOU KNOW. WHEN YOU HAVE BORDERS, YOU HAVE A NATION. YOU TAKE AWAY THE BORDERS, THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY THE BORDERS. THEY WANT TO TAKE DOWN THE WALL. IS WALL IS NOW 400 PLUS MILES LONG. HOW ABOUT THAT? IT GOES VERY HIGH AND VERY LOW. IT GOES DOWN DEEP, NOW TWO REASONS. TO HOLD IT UP, THAT'S ONE, THAT'S A GOOD REASON, BUT ALSO, FOR THE TUNNELS, AND ARIZONA IS VERY HAPPY. WE JUST GOT SOME NUMBERS BACK FROM ARIZONA. VERY GOOD. NUMBERS FROM FLORIDA, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. LOOK AT ALL THOSE PEOPLE. THERE IS THE GREAT JOHN ROBERTS. WHO GENERALLY SPEAKING VERY GOOD. JOHN GENERALLY, BUT HE'S BEEN WRONG. HELLO, JOHN, ARE YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME? HE'S A GOOD GUY. JOHN IS GOOD. THEY ARE NOT ALL FAKE. JUST ABOUT 85% OF THEM. BUT ISN'T IT AMAZING, YOU KNOW, SOME DAY I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A SPEECH WITHOUT ANY PRESS. WITHOUT ANY PRESS. ONE LITTLE MISTAKE AND THEY TRY AND TAKE YOU OUT, AND I DO THIS FOUR TIMES A DAY. IT'S CRAZY. SO WE'RE GOING ON A TOUR FOR THE NEXT 10 DAYS, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? WE'RE DOWN TO 10 OR 11 DAYS. AND WE'LL BE DOING TWO OR THREE OF THESE, AND THEN FOUR OF THESE AND THEN WE'LL END UP WITH FIVE OR SIX OF THESE. IS THIS ANY KIND OF A LIFE? IS THIS A LIFE? WHO CAN DO THAT? WHO CAN DO THAT? DO YOU THINK SLEEPY JOE CAN DO THAT? I DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK HE CAN DO IT. I KNEW THERE WAS A REASON I WANTED TO BE AT THE VILLAGES. THIS IS VERY HARD. THEY SAID THEY HAVE NO FIELD THAT'S LARGE ENOUGH. I SAID DO THEY HAVE A POLO FIELD SOME PLACE? LOOK AT THAT EQUIPMENT. LOOK AT THOSE HELICOPTERS. HOW GOOD ARE THEY? EVERYTHING IS GOOD. 2.5 TRILLION, WE SHOULD HAVE GOOD HELICOPTERS. BUT IF BIDEN WINS YOUR BOARDLERS BE GONE AND YOUR COUNTRY WILL BE GONE, FRANKLY. LOOK. THIS IS NOT A MAN THAT'S CAPABLE, WHEN I MEET WITH THESE HEADS OF STATE, THE ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU, THEY ARE SHARP. THEY ARE SHARP. THEY ARE NOT OFF. THEY ARE SHARP. THIS IS NOT A MAN THAT CAN HANDLE THE JOB. HE LEAVES HIS HOUSE THIS MORNING, GETS UP, AND I'M GOING TO TALK AT IT. ALL HE TALKS ABOUT IS COVID, COVIDCO, COVID, COVID. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SCARE EVERYBODY. WE'RE ROUNDING THE TURN, ROUNDING THE CORNER BEAUTIFULLY. BUT JOE BIDEN WAS VERY DISRESPECTFUL LAST NIGHT TO PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. YOU SAW THAT. BARACK OBAMA, REMEMBER, ROUGH LIMBAUGH WOULD ALWAYS SAY AMY CONEY BARRETT, AND RUSSIA IS DOING OKAY RUSH IS GREAT, DO WE KNOW RUSH? HE'S GOT SUCH GUTS. HE'S GOING THROUGH A LOT BUT HE'S GOT COURAGE LIKE FEW PEOPLE HAVE. AT LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE HE WAS REALLY DISRESPECTFUL. WHAT HE SAID. THAT HE, JOE, WAS VICE PRESIDENT, NOT PRESIDENT, BLAMING OBAMA WHEN TRYING TO MAKE EXCUSES FOR THE FAILED IMMIGRATION POLICIES, RIGHT? YOU SAW THAT. I WASN'T THE PRESIDENT, IT WAS HIM, BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT CAGES. I SAID, JOE, YOU BUILT THE CAGES. CAGES FOR CHILDREN. HE SAID TRUMP BUILT CAGES AND THEY FOUND OUT IT WAS A LITTLE PROBLEM FOR THE 'NEW YORK TIMES.' IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ITS UNFUNDED LIABILITY IS, CHECK IT OUT. IT'S FAILING. IT'S ONLY A QUESTION OF WHEN BUT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE FAILING 'NEW YORK TIMES' AND A PICTURE OF THE CAGE AND THEY THOUGHT THAT I BUILT IT AND THEN SOMEBODY CALLED ME AND SAID, SIR, THAT WAS BUILT, ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT HELPED BUILD IT, THAT WAS BUILT IN 2014. I SAID 2014, I DIDN'T HAPPEN TO BE PRESIDENT THEN. IT WAS BUILT UNDER OBAMA/SLEEPY JOE BIDEN. AND SO DID YOU NOTICE WHEN I KEPT SAYING WHY DID YOU BUILD THE CAGES, JOE? HE JUST KEPT TALKING. HE DIDN'T WANT ANY PART OF IT BUT THEY STARTED IT. IF YOU WANT JOB SAFETY AND BORDERS, YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR THE PARTY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. HONEST ABE. VOTE REPUBLICAN. AND I'M VOTING EARLY TOMORROW IN FLORIDA. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? I'M COMING DOWN HERE TO VOTE. I ACTUALLY CAME DOWN HERE TO SEE THE VILLAGES AND TOMORROW MORNING I'M VOTING HERE AS OPPOSED TO SENDING IT IN. YOU KNOW, AS A MAIL-IN. I LIKE BEING ABLE TO VOTE. I'M OLD FASHION, I GUESS. I LIKE TO GET IN LINE, AND IF I HAVE TO STAND THERE FOR TWO HOURS, MAYBE THEY WILL MOVE YOU UP LITTLE BIT, BUT I LIKE TO VOTE. I'M COMING, I'M GOING TO BE VOTING HERE TOMORROW AND I URGE EVERYONE TO GO AND VOTE. HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE ALREADY VOTED? THAT'S INCREDIBLE. THANK YOU. LOOK AT YOU. HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP? HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE VOTED FOR SLEEPY JOE BIDEN? SLEEPY JOE. HE'S NOT THE GUY. FOR 47 YEARS, JOE BIDEN SENT AMERICAN JOBS TO CHINA AND OTHER NATIONS WHILE THE BIDENS VACUUMED UP. LOOK, DID YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIS SON? HE GOES INTO A COUNTRY, THE GUY LEAVES WITH LIKE VOLUMES OF MONEY, VACUUMS UP MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ALL OVER THE GLOBE. LAST NIGHT, JOE LIED STRAIGHT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE CLAIMED THAT HE HAD NEVER TAKEN A PENNY FROM ANY FOREIGN SOURCE. EVER IN MY LIFE. EVER. HIS SON, WITHOUT A JOB, HIS SON WITHOUT A JOB, KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ENERGY, AND USES THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ABOUT ENERGY? HE SAID, NO, SHE KNOWS MORE THAN HUNTER. WHERE BY THE WAY, WHERE THE HELL IS HUNTER? WHERE IS HUNTER? REMEMBER THE T-SHIRT, I SAID ONE TIME WHERE IS HUNTER? THE NEXT DAY THEY HAD A T-SHIRT WHERE IS HUNTER? THERE HE IS. HUNTER, YOU GAINED WEIGHT. YOU LOOK EVEN BETTER. YOU STILL LOOK BETTER. ANYWAY, BUT THINK OF IT. HE GETS LINED UP WITH HIS UKRAINIAN ENERGY COMPANY, NOT THE HIGHEST REPUTATION. 180,000 PER MONTH TO BE ON THE BOARD, RIGHT? JUST A $3 MILLION UP FRONT PAYMENT AND THAT'S ONLY THE FIRST NATION. HE HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF ENERGY WHATSOEVER. ANYBODY IN THIS AUDIENCE KNOWS MORE. THEY DIDN'T GO TO CHINA. LET'S GO TO CHINA. HE GETS $1.5 MILLION IN MANAGEMENT, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR IN FEES AND HE GOES TO RUSSIA AND GETS $3.5 MILLION FROM THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW'S WIFE, $3.5 MILLION, AND OBAMA WAS IN CHARGE OF ALL OF THIS STUFF. THEN THEY SOLD THE REPORT. RUSSIA. RUSSIA TAKES IT AND HE'S IN CHARGE OF RUSSIA BUT HE GOT $3.5 MILLION SO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT? HE WAS IN CHARGE OF UKRAINE, CHINA, AND RUSSIA. THAT WAS SORT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE VICE PRESIDENT. AND HE GOT MONEY FROM ALL OF THEM AND HE GOT FROM IT HIS SON AND THE SON MADE NO MONEY FOR YEARS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE'S MAKING ALL OF THIS MONEY. THEY ARE CORRUPT POLITICIANS, OKAY? YOU SAY WHAT YOU WANT. AND THEN YOU SEE THE NOTES, DID YOU SEE THE GENTLEMAN THAT GOT UP YESTERDAY AND YOU SEE WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. HE'S A LEGITIMATE PERSON BUT YOU SEE THE NOTES, YOU SEE THAT JOE GETS 10% OF EVERYTHING, RIGHT? AND TAMMY GOT 50% ON SOMETHING, AND THEN THE GUY HAS THE DEAL IN CHINA WHERE HE WANTS TO GET $10 MILLION A YEAR, $10 MILLION PER YEAR FOR INTRODUCTORY PURPOSES. IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S GOING TO INTRODUCE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW WHO HE'S GOING TO INTRODUCE, HIS FATHER? NOW, IT'S A BAD DEAL. IT'S A BAD DEAL. IT'S AS CORRUPT AS HELL. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY. IT'S AS CORRUPT AS HELL, OKAY? AND YOU KNOW, THEY SAY WHAT ABOUT YOU AND THE KIDS? I DON'T DO DEALS. I DON'T DO DEALS. I USED TO DO MORE DEALS. I WAS THE KING OF DEALS AND I DON'T DO DEALS. DON'T DO IT. POSSIBLY ALLOWED, PROBABLY ALLOWED BUT I SAID WE DON'T NEED I. JUST DON'T DO IT. MY KIDS, THESE KIDS HAVE DONE SUCH A GOOD JOB. THEY HAVE DONE SUCH A GOOD JOB AND THEY DON'T DO DEALS. THE BIDENS GOT RICH WHILE AMERICA GOT ROBBED, AND HOW DID BIDEN GET SO WEALTHY SPENDING HALF A CENTURY IN PUBLIC OFFICE? HE'S BEEN IN PUBLIC OFFICE FOR 47 YEARS. ALMOST 50 YEARS. HE USED HIS OFFICE FOR PERSONAL PROFIT AT YOUR EXPENSE, MY EXPENSE, AND ALL OF OUR EXPENSES. IN 2016, FLORIDA VOTED TO FIRE THIS DEPRAVED POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND YOU ELECTED AN OUTSIDER AS PRESIDENT, WHO IS FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST AND PUTTING THE VILLAGES FIRST. PUTTING THE VILLAGES FIRST. WE'RE PUTTING THE VILLAGES FIRST AND IF I DON'T SOUND LIKE A TYPICAL WASHINGTON POLITICIAN, IT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. AND IF I DON'T ALWAYS PLAY BY THE RULES OF THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT, THE DEEP STATE, THE RHINOS, YOU KNOW THE RHINOS ARE ALMOST WORSE THAN OUR ENEMY. THE RHINOS, WE LOVE THOSE RHINOS. REPUBLICAN IN NAME ONLY. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, RIGHT? REPUBLICAN IN NAME ONLY. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF THEM. BUT THEY ARE SLOWLY DISAPPEARING, AMAZING. THEY DISAPPEAR INTO THE WOODS. BUT, I DON'T ALWAYS PLAY BY THE RULES OF THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT. IT'S BECAUSE I WAS ELECTED TO FIGHT FOR YOU, AND I FOUGHT FOR YOU HARDER THAN ANY PRESIDENT HAS EVER FOUGHT. FOR ANYBODY. AND WITH YOUR VOTE WE'LL CONTINUE TO CUT TAXES. I GOT YOU THE LARGEST TAX CUT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. CUT REGULATIONS, LOWER DRUG PRICES, YOUR DRUGS WILL BE GOING DOWN 60, 70, 80% BECAUSE I'M INSTITUTING WHAT'S CALLED A FAVORITE NATIONS CLAUSE. YOU SEE ALL THE COMMERCIALS THE DRUG COMPANIES ARE RUNNING AGAINST ME. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY. THE BIGGEST LOBBYIST, THE BIG IT DONATE FOR BY FAR ARE THE DRUG COMPANIES. A LOT OF MONEY. THEY ARE TAKING COMMERCIALS. I DON'T CARE, I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING. I INSTITUTE ADD FAVORITE NATIONS CLAUSE WHERE THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW, WE PAY THE HIGHEST PRICE OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD BY FAR. IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE. IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE. COULD YOU HAVE A PILL THAT SELLS FOR 10 CENTS IDENTICAL, AND IN THE UNITED STATES, IT COULD SELL FOR $3. THAT'S HOW BAD IT IS. IT'S TERRIBLE. SO I INSTITUTED WHAT WE CALL A FAVORED NATIONS CLAUSE, SO WE'LL NOW GO, WE'LL BE PAYING THE LOWEST PRICE MATCH, LOWEST PRICE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. AND I'M GETTING HIT HARD ON THAT ONE IS THAT OKAY, PAM? I'LL HAVE TO WITHSTAND, COMMERCIALS ARE UNBELIEVABLE. THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLE. BUT THAT'S OKAY. PEOPLE GET IT. WE WANT TO SUPPORT OUR POLICE, PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT, THEY WANT TO TAKE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT AWAY. DEFEND OUR BORDERS. MAINTAIN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, AND ENSURE MORE PRODUCTS ARE PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THE PHRASE, THAT GORGEOUS PHRASE, 'MADE IN THE USA.' WE'LL DELIVER EPIC PROSPERITY AND A SAFE VACCINE IS QUICKLY COMING THAT WILL HELP END BIT WAY, IT'S ENDING ANYWAY'S. EUROPE, HAS A SURGE. LOOK AT FLORIDA. YOU HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR, BY THE WAY. GREAT GOVERNOR. AND YOU HAVE AN EVEN BETTER FIRST LADY BUT I WON'T SAY THAT NOW YOU HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR, AND THE GOVERNOR IS GOING TO GO TO CANADA. I GAVE HIM THE RIGHT. HE'S GOING TO CANADA WHERE THEY PAY 50% LESS FOR THE SAME DRUG AND HE'S GOING TO BUY FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA, UNTIL THIS FAVORED NATIONS KICKS IN, WHERE YOU GO DOWN 70, 80, 90%. LAST YEAR, WAS THE FIRST YEAR IN 52 YEARS THAT DRUG PRICES IN THIS COUNTRY WENT DOWN. NOT BY MUCH BUT THEY WENT DOWN. THEY DIDN'T GO UP. 1%. NOT MUCH. 1%. BUT WITH FAVORED NATIONS, YOU'LL GO DOWN 50, 60, 70, MAYBE EVEN 80% IN DRUG PRICES. BUT I GAVE YOUR GOVERNOR THE RIGHT TO GO TO CANADA AND BUY DRUGS IN CANADA. THE SAME EXACT DRUG FROM THE SAME FACTORIES, SAME COMPANY. 50%, AND EVEN MORE DISCOUNTS, AND YOU'LL START SEEING IT FAST. ULTIMATELY THE FAVORED NATIONS WILL KICK IN. I BETTER BE PRESIDENT WHEN ALL OF THIS STUFF HAPPENS. BECAUSE IT'S ALL DONE. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF SLEEPY JOE SAID, I'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB ON DRUG PRICING. WHAT DID YOU DO, JOE? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID. SO WE'RE GOING THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WE'RE GOING TO QUICKLY END THIS PANDEMIC THIS HORRIBLE PLAGUE THAT CAME IN FROM CHINA. THEY SHOULD HAVE STOPPED IT, AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO FORGET WHAT THEY DID. WE'RE NOT FORGETTING AT ALL. I SIGNED A GREAT TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA. RECENTLY THEY HAD THE BIGGEST ORDER OF CORN IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, BIGGEST ORDER OF SOYBEANS, BIGGEST ORDER OF BEEF. BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NO LONGER THE SAME TO ME. IT DOESN'T MEAN THE SAME. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT. I WOULD HAVE BEEN SO PROUD OF IT BUT NOW I DON'T VIEW AT THIS TIME SAME. NORMAL LIFE, THAT'S ALL WE WANT. NORMAL LIFE WILL FULLY RESUME. WE HAVE THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN OUR HISTORY. AND NEXT YEAR WILL BE THE GREATEST ECONOMIC YEAR IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE'RE DOING IT. WE HAVE A SOUP IF YOU LOOK AT HOUSING, IF YOU LOOK AT CARS, IF YOU LOOK AT CAR PRODUCTION, NOBODY CAN BELIEVE THE NUMBERS, AND YOU WILL HAVE A NUMBER RELEASED VERY SOON. THINK OF THIS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GDP. NOW, FED, ATLANTA, I BELIEVE THE ATLANTA FED PROJECTED GDP OF 35% IN THE THIRD QUARTER. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO BE 35. IN ANY EVENT THAT WOULD BE HIGHER THAN ANY GDP EVER IN HISTORY, AND MANY TIMES HIGHER THAN OUR HIGHEST WHICH I THINK WAS LIKE 7% OR 8%. 35%, WE'LL SEE. WE'LL SEE. IT WAS 20%. IT WAS 12%, I WOULD SAY IT WAS GREAT BUT THEY JUST CAME OUT AND SAID 35. WHO KNOWS IF THEY ARE RIGHT. HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS. IT'S GOING TO BE ANNOUNCED RIGHT BEFORE NOVEMBER 3. RIGHT BEFORE. AND I'M WILLING TO TAKE MY CHANCES BEING A GAMBLING MAN. I'M WILLING TO TAKE MY CHANCES. I THINK HIT BE A MAGNIFICENT WHETHER IT'S 25, 35, 20, NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT NUMBER BECAUSE WE'RE DOING NUMBERS LIKE NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE. WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT OF 40% OR 42%. YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS? IT DROPPED DOWN TO 7.8%. YESTERDAY, LARRY KUDLOW, THE GREAT LARRY KUDLOW, HE SAID BY A CERTAIN STANDARD IT'S 5.8%. THINK OF THAT, AND WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF ROUNDING IT OUT BUT IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC. IT'S ACTUALLY AMAZING WHAT EVERYBODY HAS DONE AND I'VE BEEN GIVE AN LOT OF HELP WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE OVER HERE. I GAVE THE LARGE OF THE TAX REFORMS IN HISTORY AND WE'LL CUT TAXES FURTHER FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE'RE CUTTING TAXES FOR PEOPLE THAT NEED JOBS, AND NOBODY HAS EVER DONE IT AT A LEVEL LIKE WE'VE DONE IT. BY CONTRAST, SLEEPY JOE BIDEN WILL GIVE YOU THE SINGLE BIGGEST TAX HIKE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. HE'S TALKING ABOUT QUADRUPLING TAXES, $4 TRILLION IN TAXES SO HE CAN WASTE IT ON THE GREEN NEW DEAL. THE GREEN NEW DEAL. NO CARS. NO AIRPLANES, NO COWS, WHATEVER HAPPENED? DID THEY LEAVE THE COWS IN? I THINK THEY HAD TO TAKE THEM OUT. ORIGINALLY THEY DIDN'T WANT ANY CATTLE OR COWS WHICH IS PRETTY BRUTAL WHEN YOU THINK OF IT. THEY WILL BURY YOU IN REGULATIONS, DISMANTLE YOUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS, DISSOLVE OUR BORDERS, CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS, TERMINATE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, DESTROY YOUR SUBURBS. I'M ALWAYS SAYING, THE FRAUDULENT MEDIA, I ALWAYS GET UP AND I HAVE FUN. PLEASE, PLEASE SUBURBAN WOMEN, YOU SHOULD LOVE ME. I ENDED THE REGULATION THAT'S GOING TO DESTROY THE SUBURBS. PLEASE. PLEASE, SUBURBAN WOMEN, YOU SHOULD LOVE ME. BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID I'M NOT DOING THAT WELL WITH SUBURBAN WOMEN. I SAID WHY? LAST TIME I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING TERRIBLY WITH WOMEN. THEN I GOT 52%. THEY SAID WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED WITH TRUMP AND WOMEN ALL OF A SUDDEN? REMEMBER, THEY SAID TRUMP DID WELL WITH WOMEN, SO NOW THEY GO, SO I SAY, PLEASE, PLEASE, SUBURBAN WOMEN, PLEASE, PLEASE LOVE ME, SUBURBAN WOMEN, I WANT YOU TO LOVE ME. BECAUSE I GOT RID OF THE REGULATION THAT'S GOING TO DESTROY YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE PROJECTS NEXT TO YOUR HOUSE. YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE CRIME IN THE SUBURBS. ET CETERA, RIGHT. SO I GO ON '60 MINUTES,' LESLIE, ANOTHER BEAUTY, SHE GOES, YOU WERE BEGGING, YOU WERE BEGGING SUBURBAN WOMEN TO LOVE YOU, WEREN'T YOU? I SAID, NO, NO, I WAS JUST HAVING FUN. WE WERE JUST HAVING FUN. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. THEY ARE BAD. THEY ARE BAD. BUT THEY WANT TO DECIMATE FLORIDA SENIORS, AND SENIORS, ALL SENIORS, OKAY? BY THE WAY WHAT I'VE DONE FOR SUBURBAN WOMEN, BUT SUBURBAN PEOPLE, PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE SUBURBS, YOU KNOW, THAT'S REALLY THE DREAM. THAT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND, YOU KNOW, 30% OF THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE WE SAY, OH IS THAT RACIST, 30% OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SUBURBS ARE MINORITY GROUPS, HISPANIC AMERICAN, BLACK AMERICAN, THINK OF IT, ASIAN AMERICANS, 30%, 31%, ARE FROM MINORITY GROUPS. FOR YEARS JOE BIDEN FOUGHT TO CUT YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. HE WANTED TO CUT IT. HE WANTED TO KNOCK IT OUT, AND MEDICARE, A FACT WHICH JOE HAS NOW FALSELY DENIED. I LOVED IT YESTERDAY THE WAY HE DENIED THAT. SO DOES THAT MEAN YOU WANT TO GET RID OF FOSSIL FUEL, JOE? YES, THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS. THANK YOU. LET'S END IT, BY THE WAY, I THOUGHT I GOT TREATED VERY FAIRLY BY THE ANCHOR. I THOUGHT, RIGHT? IS SURPRISED. SHE'S BEEN INTERRUPTING ME OVER THE YEARS, I WAS SURPRISED BUT HER NETWORK HAS BEEN CRAZY. NBC. COMCAST. COM, BUT I THOUGHT KRISTEN DID A VERY GOOD JOB YESTERDAY. SOME PEOPLE SAID SHE INTERRUPTED ME MUCH MORE THAN SHE INTERRUPTED SLEEPY JOE. BUT THAT'S BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TO SAY. BUT I THOUGHT SHE WAS FAIR. I SAID IT DURING THE SHOW, I THINK YOU'VE HANDLED IT VERY PROFESSIONALLY, IT'S NOT EASY, SO TODAY I WANT TO SHOW YOU JOE BIDEN'S OWN WORDS, THE VIDEO I'M ABOUT TO PLAY WAS CREATED BY BERNIE SANDERS. CRAZY BERNIE. BERNIE IS THE SINGLE GREATEST LOSER. THE WAY HE LOSES, HE GETS SPORTSMANSHIP OF THE YEAR, RIGHT? WHAT THEY DID TO HIM FOUR YEARS AGO IS QUITE TERRIBLE. WHAT THEY DID TO HIM THIS YEAR WAS HE JUST GOES BACK TO CONGRESS AND TALKS. HE'S CRAZY BERNIE. A LOT OF HIS PEOPLE WILL COME WITH US, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY? THEY LOVE OUR TRADE POLICY BECAUSE HE LIKE ME UNDERSTANDS HOW BADLY WE'VE BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING OUR ALLIES, BY THE WAY. THE VIDEO I'M ABOUT TO PLAY WAS CREATED BY CRAZY BERNIE EARLIER THIS YEAR TO EXPOSE JOE BIDEN'S ATROCIOUS RECORD AND HIS EGREGIOUS LIES. GO AHEAD. PLAY IT, MR. DE MILL. I TELL YOU WHAT, DID THESE PEOPLE DO A GOOD JOB? DID THEY DO A GOOD JOB? HE'S A LIAR. HE LIES ABOUT EVERYTHING. HE'S NOW LYING ABOUT NOT BEING A CORRUPT POLITICIAN. I CALLED HIM LAST NIGHT. I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT BUT HE'S A CORRUPT POLITICIAN, AND HE'LL LIE. BUT HE LIED ABOUT THAT. HE LIED ABOUT FRACKING. AND HE'LL LOOK AT YOU AND HE'LL LIE. HE GOES, THERE WILL BE NO FRACKING. THERE WILL BE NO FRACKING. THIS GOES ON FOR A YEAR. THEN HE GOES TO PENNSYLVANIA, HE SAYS, THERE WILL BE FRACKING, AND THEN YOU'LL SAY, WAIT, YOU SAID THERE WOULD BE NONE. HE SAID NO, I NEVER SAID THAT. THIS GUY IS EITHER REALLY STUPID OR HE LIES. A LEVEL THAT NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. BY THE WAY, THAT'S THE GREAT VIDEO. WHO DID THAT VIDEO? I LOVE THAT VIDEO? WHO THE HELL DID IT? I HAVE SOME GOOD TALENTED PEOPLE. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP, NO ONE WILL TOUCH YOUR MEDICARE AND NOBODY WILL TOUCH YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. OKAY? BY THE WAY, THAT'S A DEVASTATING VIDEO. THAT'S I JUST SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. THAT'S DEVASTATING. NOW BIDEN IS PUSHING FREE GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE, WHICH IS SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. AND MASS AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS, MEANING HE WANTS TO TAKE CARE OF ILLEGAL ALIENS BEFORE HE TAKES CARE OF OUR SENIORS. THE PROBLEM IS, WE ALL WANT TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY BUT IF YOU EVER DO THAT, WHERE YOU GIVE MEDICARE, FREE EVERYTHING INCLUDING EDUCATION, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS COUNTRY SWAMPED WITH MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, WANTING TO POUR IN TO GET IT. YOU CAN'T DO IT. AND IT WOULD OBLITERATE YOUR MEDICARE AND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. TOTALLY OBLITERATE IT. JOE BIDEN CARES MORE ABOUT ILLEGAL ALIENS THAN HE DOES ABOUT SENIOR CITIZENS AND THAT'S TRUE. YOU SEE IT IN THAT CLIP. I BELIEVE THAT AMERICAN SENIORS MUST COME FIRST, OKAY? MUST COME FIRST. THAT'S TRUE. MUST COME FIRST. LAST NIGHT, BIDEN OUTLINED A PLAN TO CREATE SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, RAIDING MEDICARE TO FUND IT, BIDEN'S RUNNING MATE IS THE MOST LIBERAL MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE. KAMALA WILL NOT BE YOUR FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT. THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO B. WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE SOCIO-IST LOOK, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SOCIALIST NATION. WE WON'T HAVE A SOCIALIST PRESIDENT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT OR PUT UP WITH IT. THE MOST LIBERAL MEMBER, MORE SO THAN BERNIE OF THE U.S. SENATE, CO-SPONSORS A SOCIALIST HEALTHCARE PLAN TO END MEDICARE, AS YOU KNOW IT, AND MEDICARE WORKS. MEDICARE WORKS. WE LOVE OUR MEDICARE. IT DOES WORK. ELIMINATE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE, WHICH NEARLY TWO MILLION FLORIDA SENIORS DEPEND ON INCLUDING ONE OUT OF EVERY TWO HISPANIC SENIOR. YOU SEE HOW WELL I'M DOING WITH HISPANIC. DO YOU SEE? THEY ARE GOING CRAZY. THEY ARE GOING CRAZY. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? AFRICA AMERICANS DOING WELL. HISPANIC, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. NOT THE HISPANICS, I'M TALKING THE DEMOCRATS, THEY ARE SAYING WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE? YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG SURPRISE. YOU KNOW THAT BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL YOU HEARD ABOUT THE RED WAVE, RIGHT? IT'S CALLED WE'RE ALL WAITING FOR THAT GREAT RED WAVE, BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SUPPOSE ALL THESE VOTES COME IN AND WE CATCH IT UP LATER ON, BUT WE CATCH UP LATER ON. THERE IS ONLY ONE PROBLEM. IN A LOT OF CASES WE'RE ALREADY WINNING. THIS IS BEFORE THE WAVE. WE'RE ALREADY WINNING. SO A LOT OF INTERESTING THINGS ARE HAPPENING, AND THOSE GUYS BACK THERE ARE SAYING, SOME OF IT LIKE IT, I THINK, BUT YOU KNOW THE INTERESTING THING, YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEIR RATE SNGS CAN YOU MARGIN IF YOU HAD FOUR YEARS OF COVERING SLEEPY JOE. IT WOULDN'T BE FOUR YEARS. SINCE I TOOK OFFICE, WE'VE REDUCED MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PREMIUMS BY 34%. GOOD MANAGEMENT. SOCIALIST HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS LIKE THE ONES SUPPORTED BY BIDEN AND HARRIS ALWAYS END UP DENYING COVERAGE TO THE SICK AND THE ELDERLY IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE SOARING COST. OUR OPPONENTS WANT TO TURN AMERICA INTO A COMMUNIST CUBA, INTO A SOCIALIST VENEZUELA, IF YOU LOOK AT THE IDEOLOGY, THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, TAKE LOOK AT PORTLAND, WITH THE ANARCHISTS ALL OVER THE PLACE. WE'RE ASKING FOR GOVERNMENT APPROVAL TO GO IN AND CLEAN OUT THAT MESS, WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 140 DAYS. BUT IT'S REALLY BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS. IT'S BEEN GOING ON LIKE IN PORTLAND, ANARCHISTS. LOOK AT WHAT WE DID IN MINNEAPOLIS. AFTER 10 DAYS OF RIOTING AND EVERYTHING ELSE, WE SENT IN THE NATIONAL GUARD. THEY LINED UP. AGAIN. AGAIN. AGAIN. WORLD'S MOST EXPENSIVE OUTFIT, $250,000 A PIECE. AND THEY HAD THEIR TEAR GAS. THEY HAD THEIR PEPPER SPRAY, WHICH THE DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT YOU TO USE. THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO USE ANYTHING. THEY YOU WANT TO GET HIT. THEY WANT YOU TO GET HIT WITH ROCKS AND STONES. BUT THEY HAD THEIR TEAR GAS, AND THEY JUST MARCH FORWARD. IN ONE HALF-HOUR THE WHOLE THING WAS OVER. IT WAS ALL OVER. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED US IN SOONER. IF BIDEN WINS, RADICAL LEFT WILL TRANSFORM THIS COUNTRY INTO SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL NOT RECOGNIZE. THEY WANT TO SHATTER THE MIDDLE CLASS WITH TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN NEW TAXES, $4 TRILLION. PACK THE SUPREME COURT WITH FAR LESS JUDGES, 16, 18, 20, AND HOW DO YOU LIKE AMY CONEY BARRETT? SHE'S GREAT. SHE'S GREAT. SHE MADE THEM LOOK A LITTLE FOOLISH, DIDN'T SHE, AS THE DEMOCRATS WENT AFTER HER, IT WAS LIKE, WHAT DO YOU HAVE WRITTEN DOWN? WHAT DO YOU HAVE WRITTEN DOWN ON YOUR PAD? NOTHING. HAPPEN TO BE A REPUBLICAN THAT ASKED THE QUESTION. FIGURED THAT ONE OUT, RIGHT? THEY WANT TO UNLEASH THE VIOLENT RIOTERS, THE MS-13 KILLERS AND THEY WILL INDOCTRINATE YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN WITH POISONOUS ANTI-AMERICAN LIES IN THE SCHOOLS, WHICH I HAVE ENDED, WHICH WE'VE ENDED. IF YOU WANT YOUR GRANDCHILDREN TO GROW UP IN A FREE NATION, WHERE THEY CAN SPEAK THEIR MINDS AND PURSUE THE AMERICAN DREAM, THEN YOU MUST DEFEAT SLOOPY JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT. IT'S NOT REALLY JOE. LOOK, LET'S FACE IT, HE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE BUT HE'S SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE, THEY HAVE GOT SOME PROBLEMS. YOU'VE GOT TO REJECT THE LEFT WING FASCISM AND VOTE FOR AMERICAN FREEDOM. OUR COUNTRY IS SET TO BE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. WATCH. WATCH. WE'RE SET. WE'RE JOINED TODAY BY SOME INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND A MAN I JUST MENTIONED, HE'S JUST A FRIEND OF MINE. HE SAID I WOULD LOVE TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR AND HE DID RUN AND I ENDORSED HIM AND HE RAN AND HE WENT LIKE A ROCKET SHIP. HE WAS A GREAT CANDIDATE. HE HAD TO RUN AGAINST A VERY POWERFUL, VERY POWERFUL, GREAT DEMOCRAT, WITH A TREMENDOUS FUTURE. THEY SAID HE'S GOING TO BE THE FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. HOW IS HE DOING, BY THE WAY? IS HE DOING FINE? I THINK RON DID HIM A FAVOR BY BEATING HIM. HE DID THE DEMOCRATS A FAVOR BY BEATING THEM, RIGHT? BUT RON DeSANTIS BECAME YOUR GOVERNOR. YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE FIRST LADY IN CASEY DeSANTIS, AND THEY ARE HERE. RON, HOW ARE WE DOING? IF WE DON'T WIN I'LL NEVER SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN. WARRIOR, GREAT GUY, THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR ME. HE'S TOUGH. HE'S STRONG. HE'S SMART. CONGRESSMAN MIKE WALTZ. CONGRESSMAN. A MAN WITH MAYBE THE GREATEST NAME IN POLITICS, WHO ALSO, WHENEVER YOU NEED HIM, HE'S THERE AND HE LOVES YOU STATE, AND HE LOVERS OUR COUNTRY. DANIEL WEBSTER. HOW IS THAT NAME? HOW IS THAT NAME? I LOVE DANIEL. WHAT A NAME. WITH A NAME LIKE THAT HOW CAN YOU LOSE IN POLITICS, RIGHT? DANIEL WEBSTER. CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE WHOSE WAY AHEAD IN THE POLLS. WAY AHEAD. HOW IS THAT NUMBER LOOKING? HUGE. IT'S HUGE. SHE'S DOING GREAT. FUTURE STAR. AND A FUTURE AND CURRENT AND PAST STAR, AND A REALLY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE, SOMEBODY THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE, FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL, SHE COULD HAVE ANYTHING SHE WANTED, BY THE WAY, ANYTHING, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDY. SHE COULD HAVE ANYTHING SHE WANTED. ANY TIME YOU WANT TO COME INTO THE ADMINISTRATION, JUST GO, BUT I HEAR SHE'S DOING VERY WELL TO PUT IT MILDLY, RIGHT? ALL BIDEN AND HIS HANGERS, IN THE MEDIA WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS COVID, COVID, COVID. YOU TURN ON CNN, YOU TURN ON CNN, YOU TURN ON MSNBC, YOU TURN ON THIS NETWORK, COVID, COVID, COVID, ON NOVEMBER 4 YOU WON'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE'RE ROUNDING THAT TURN. BUT THEY WANT TO SCARE YOU TO TRY TO MAKE YOU VOTE FOR BIDEN. THAT'S ALL THEY CAN TALK ABOUT BECAUSE HIS RECORD IS HORRIBLE. BY THE WAY, HIS RECORD WITH THE H1N1 WHICH HE REFERS TO AS SWINE FLU, WAS HORRENDOUS. THE PERSON THAT RAN IT, HIS CHIEF-OF-STAFF, RIGHT, CHIEF-OF-STAFF, THE CHIEF-OF-STAFF SAID, IT WAS A CATASTROPHE. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE DOING. IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER. NOW HE'S GOING TO COME IN AND TELL US WHAT TO DO. DID YOU EVER SEE WHERE HE SAID, YOU WERE LATE EXCEPT WHEN I CLOSED IT TO CHINA, HE SAID I SHOULDN'T CLOSE IT. FOR 2 1/2 MONTHS HE SAID I SHOULDN'T CLOSE IT. THEN HE ULTIMATELY ADMITTED HE WAS WRONG AND THEN AMAZINGLY GOT A NOMINATION WHICH HE SHOULDN'T HAVE CONTINUE, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY? POCAHANTAS, HE WOULD HAVE WON EVERY STATE SO YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT GOT LUCKY IN. PRIMETIME THEY USED TO CALL HIM 1% JOE. NOW IN FAR LESS THAN PRIMETIME HE GETS THE NOMINATION. FIGURE THIS ONE, ONLY IN THE WORLD OF POLITICS CAN THIS HAPPEN BUT IF YOU WATCH CNN AND MSNBC, THE NETWORKS, THAT'S ALL THEY TALK ABOUT. THEY FOCUS ON CASE NUMBERS. YOU KNOW WHY WE HAVE SO MANY? BECAUSE WE DO MORE TESTING THAN ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TIMES FIVE, 10, 20, YOU HAVE MANY COUNTRIES WHO DON'T DO ANY TESTING SO THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CASES. YOU HAVE MANY COUNTRIES WITH VERY FEW CASES BECAUSE THEY DON'T TEST. WE HAVE TESTING LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEF. WE GOT STARTED BECAUSE THE FAKE NEWS SAID WHERE IS THE TEST SOMETHING WE HAVE THE BEST TESTS IN THE WORLD AND THERE IS PLENTY GOOD ABOUT TESTING, TOO. THE BAD THING IS YOU FIND CASES. BARON TRUMP, RIGHT? YOUNG MAN, 14, STRONG. SO HE TESTED POSITIVE. I SAID, OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE. THEY SAID, NO, IT'S OKAY. GREAT DOCTOR, WHITE HOUSE DOCTOR, SEAN, I SAID, LIKE 15 SECONDS LATER, HOW IS BARRON DOING? HE'S ALL BETTER, SIR. I SAID WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE FACT IS YOUNG PEOPLE, 99.99 OR SOMETHING, YOUNG PEOPLE, THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS, I HATE TO SAY IT THEY ARE A LITTLE STRONGER THAN OUR I AM IMMUNE SYSTEMS, I GOT IT AND HERE WE ARE. THE GOOD NEWS, ONCE YOU GET IT, YOU'RE IMMUNED. BEFORE I GOT IT, I HEARD YOU WERE IMMUNE FOR LIFE. ONCE I GOT IT, THEY SAID, NO IT'S ONLY FOUR MONTHS. WE HAVE A DOUBLE STANDARD. IT WAS ALWAYS LIKE, ONCE YOU GET IT YOU'RE IMMUNE. I GOT IT, NOPE, IT'S ONLY GOOD FOR FOUR MONTHS. FAKE NEWS. LAST NIGHT, BIDEN AND HIS VERY WEAK DEBATE PERFORMANCE SAID, DID YOU SEE SOME OF THE DEBATE, 91% IN MY FAVOR TO NINE. 91 TO 9. I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT BUT LAST NIGHT HE SAID AMERICA IS ENTERING A DARK WINTER. ISN'T THAT INSPIRATIONAL? HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THINK OF IT. WE HAVE THIS GUY THAT CAN'T EVEN SPEAK AND HE GOES WE'RE ENTERING A DARK WINTER. SO INSPIRATIONAL. BUT HE'S TRIED TO SCARE PEOPLE BASICALLY. BECAUSE HE'S BEEN SUCH A FAILURE AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT, THAT THIS IS SOMETHING, BUT WHAT THEY DON'T REMEMBER IS THE SWINE FLU AND HOW IT WAS BUT I BRING IT UP WHENEVER I CAN BUT WE'RE NOT ENTERING A DARK WINTER. WE'RE ENTERING THE FINAL TURN AND APPROACHING THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. THAT'S THE WAY I LOOK AT IT. I TOOK VERY RAPID ACTION TO BAN TRAVEL FROM CHINA AND EUROPE, AND BIDEN OPPOSED IT. WE PIONEERED INCREDIBLE THERAPIES AND WE REDUCED THE FATALITY RATE BY 85%. THINK OF THAT. WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. AND WE WENT OUT AND WE MADE JUST INCREDIBLE THINGS. THE EQUIPMENT WE MADE. THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE BOUGHT. THE VENTILATORS. WE'RE THE KING OF VENTILATORS NOW AS A COUNTRY. EVERYBODY HAS VENTILATORS. WE'RE SENDING THEM ALL OVER THE WORLD. WE'RE MAKING THEM BY THE THOUSANDS. WE'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT'S THE BIGGEST MOBILIZATION OF ANYTHING SINCE WORLD WAR II. THE VENTILATORS. THE BIG THING. AND I'M WORKING TO MAKE THE ANTIBODY TREATMENT THAT I RECEIVED AVAILABLE FREE TO ANYBODY THAT NEEDS IT. THEY WILL HAVE IT DONE PRETTY SOON. ALL I ALL I KNOW, I CAN TALK TO THIS GROUP BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I DIDN'T FEEL SO GOOD. I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO FEEL BAD. BUT I DIDN'T FEEL SO GOOD. I SAID, DOC, I'M NOT FEELING SO GOOD. HE SAID LET ME TAKE A LOOK. HE SAID, OH, YOUR POSITIVE. BUT I CAN'T PUT MYSELF INTO A BASEMENT. I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I CANNOT PUT MYSELF INTO A BEAUTIFUL BEDROOM. I GOT TO WORK. I MEET WITH MILITARY LEADERS. I MEET WITH FOREIGN LEADERS. I MEET WITH GOLDSTAR FAMILIES. I MEET WITH SO MANY PEOPLE, I CANNOT CLOSE MYSELF UP. I SAY OFTENTIMES, I MEET A LOT OF PEOPLE, THAT'S RISKY. BUT ONE DAY I GOT IT. THE FIRST LADY GOT IT. AND I GOT IT. WE SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT WE HAVE A JOB TO DO. AND WE BEAT IT. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, I WASN'T FEELING GREAT, AND I'M LAYING IN BED. WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT, YOU ARE NOT FEELING GOOD, YOU'RE LAYING IN A BED, YOU GOT MORE DOCTORS THAN ANY HUMAN BEING HAS EVER HAD. I HAD 12 DOCTORS. I HAD DOCTORS FROM THE GREATEST SCHOOLS IN THE WORLD. JOHNS HOPKINS WAS THERE. WALTER REED MEDICAL CENTER. THESE PEOPLE ARE UNBELIEVABLE. OUR WOUNDED WARRIORS, OUR PEOPLE TO COME HOME BADLY INJURED, BADLY HURT. THE JOB THEY DO IS INCREDIBLE. SOME EVERY DOCTOR WAS A DIFFERENT SPECIALIST, AND I HAD MORE HANDS ON ME THAN ANY HUMAN BEING, AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT, RIGHT? I SAID COME ON, LET'S TAKE LET'S MAKE THIS QUICK. THE BOTTOM LINE IS I TOOK THIS REGENERON, IT'S CALLED, AND I WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND OUT LIKE SUPERMAN. IT'S LIKE GET ME OUT OF HERE. I'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO THE PEOPLE. MAYBE IT WORKS, MAYBE IT DOESN'T. MAYBE IT'S ME. SUPERMAN, LOOK AT THAT. SUPERTRUMP. LOOK AT THIS GUY. DO YOU LIVE IN THE VILLAGE THIS GUY LIVES IN THE VILLAGES. I THINK I'LL MOVE IN. I HAVE AN IDEA I WILL SELL MAR-A-LAGO AND MOVE TO THE VILLAGES. YOU KNOW WHAT? NOT THE WORST IDEA. I LIKE THAT IDEA. I LIKE THE PEOPLE HERE. WE'LL HAVE 100 MILLION VACCINE DOSES BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR, AND SENIORS WILL BE THE FIRST IN LINE. WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR SENIORS. UNDER MY PLAN, YOU WILL GET INCREDIBLE, LIFE-SAVING THERAPIES. THERAPIES ARE INCREDIBLE. REMDESIVIR JUST GOT APPROVED. YOU SAW THAT. THE FDA HAS MOVED AT A PACE THEY HAVE NEVER MOVED BEFORE. THEY ARE MOVING THINGS IN WEEKS WHICH USED TO TAKE YEARS. THAT'S A LITTLE PRODDING FROM ME, I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, BUT THEY ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. YOU WILL GET A VACCINE THAT ENDS THE EPIDEMIC OR THE PANDEMIC AND IT ENDS IT OR ERADICATES IT, BUT WITHOUT IT, IT GOES AWAY. WITH IT, IT GOES AWAY FASTER, AND IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN VERY SOON. A LOT OF GREAT COMPANIES ARE RIGHT THERE. YOU WILL GET TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS, FAMILIES, AND LOVED ONES, AND YOU WILL GET TO ENJOY BEING WITH THEM IN THEIR GOLDEN YEARS. IT'S A SAD THING WHEN YOU CANNOT BE NEAR PEOPLE. DID YOU EVER HEAR OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS? YOU CANNOT BE NEAR PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE IN TROUBLE, BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE VERY CLOSE. YOU WATCH. UNDER BIDEN'S PLAN, YOU WILL BE LOCKED DOWN FOR YEARS. THE CURE WILL BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF REMEMBER THAT. YOU'VE GOT TO LEAD YOUR LIFE. YOU KNOW WHAT? SOME PEOPLE WANT TO STAY IN, AND THAT'S GOOD. DO IT. SOME PEOPLE AGREE WITH ME, AND SOME PEOPLE BUT IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN, YOU WANT TO DO WHAT YOU ARE DOING, DO IT. YOU WANT TO GET OUT, YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL AND SOCIALLY DISTANT AND ALL OF THE THINGS, AND YOU CAN WEAR A MASK IF YOU CANNOT SOCIALLY DISTANCE, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN DO. SOME PEOPLE WANT TO STAY IN, AND THAT'S OK. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT, BUT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A VACCINE, AND IT'S GOING TO BE AN INCREDIBLE SUCCESS. WHEN YOU SEE THESE VACCINES THEY ARE COMING DOWN WITH, AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE INCREDIBLE THERAPIES AND CURES. TO ME, THE THERAPY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE VACCINE. NOT EVERYBODY AGREES. GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW IT IS THERE, LIKE REGENERON, IT HAD A HELL OF AN EFFECT ON ME. SOMEBODY SET I LOOKED BETTER LAST NIGHT THAN I USED TO. I SAID I THINK IT WAS REGENERON. NO, IT'S VERY BUT TO ME I DON'T KNOW, NOT EVERYBODY AGREES, BUT TO ME, KNOWING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN KNOCK IT OUT TO ME IS ACTUALLY MORE IMPORTANT THAT A VACCINE, BUT THEY VACCINES ARE COMING. THERAPEUTICS ARE ALREADY HERE AND COMING. IN MY OPINION, THE THERAPEUTICS IN SOME CASES ARE ALREADY CURES. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE BUILT THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, AND WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN, SO IT'S CALLED MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AGAIN. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE THE HATS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY A NEW ONE. IN MY FIRST THREE YEARS, WE INCREASE FAMILY INCOME OVER $6,000 MORE THAN FIVE TIMES THE GAINS IN ALL EIGHT YEARS UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THAT MEANS. AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT, HISPANIC AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT, AND ASIAN AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT ALL REACHED THEIR LOWEST LEVELS EVER RECORDED, RIGHT? WE LIFTED NEARLY 7 MILLION AMERICANS OUT OF POVERTY INCLUDING MORE THAN 1.5 MILLION HISPANIC AMERICANS. WHEN THE VIRUS HIT, WE EXPERIENCED THE SMALLEST CONTRACTION THINK OF THAT, THE SMALLEST OF ANY MAJOR COUNTRY AND THE FASTEST RECOVERY OF ANY COUNTRY. WE ARE RECOVERING AT A LEVEL THAT NOBODY HAS SEEN, AND THAT'S DESPITE THE FACT THAT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS HAVE A LOT OF THEIR STATES CLOSED. WHEN YOU LOOK AT MICHIGAN, ALTHOUGH WE JUST WON THE COURTS AGAINST HER HE ONLY WHEN GIVEN FREEDOM WAS HER HUSBAND, RIGHT? HE WAS THE ONLY ONE ALLOWED TO GO SAILING ON THE LAKE. NOBODY ELSE COULD DO IT, BUT WE JUST WON THE CASE. IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL WHAT SHE WAS DOING. SHE WAS RUNNING IT LIKE A PRISON CAMP. YOU HAVE PENNSYLVANIA AND NORTH CAROLINA AND OTHER PLACES THEY GOT TO OPEN THEM UP. NOVEMBER 4, THEY WILL SAY WE DECIDED TO OPEN. THEY JUST WANT TO KEEP THE NUMBERS DOWN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. NOT GOING TO HELP THEM. UNDER BIDEN, IT TOOK 30 MONTHS TO RECOVER HALF THE JOBS LOST TO THE CRISIS. WE DID IT IN FIVE MONTHS. THINK OF THAT. 30 MONTHS, FIVE MONTHS. THEY HAD THE SLOWEST RECOVERY IN HISTORY OR IN 1929, SINCE 1929 THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH. THEY SAY IT WITH WAYS, BUT 1929 WAS A LONG TIME AGO. IT WAS THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE 1929. WE RECEIVED ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, AND WE'VE DONE IT WHILE PROTECTING OUR PRISTINE ENVIRONMENT. I RECENTLY SIGNED AN ORDER PLACING A MORATORIUM ON OFFSHORE DRILLING OFF THE COAST OF GEORGIA, NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, AND I DECIDED TO ADD FLORIDA. IS THAT OK? WE ADDED FLORIDA. WE DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE YOU TOO UNHAPPY. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP, WE ACHIEVED THE MOST SECURE BORDER IN U.S. HISTORY, AND WE ARE DISHING THE WALL 400 MILES AND MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL YOU DO KNOW THAT, OK? THEY LIKE TO SAY I MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE, I SHOULD HAVE SAID WE WILL NOT BUILD A WALL. WE WILL NEVER, EVER BUILD A WALL. WE WILL NEVER BUILD A WALL, AND THE DEMOCRATS WOULD HAVE INSISTED THAT I BUILD ONE. RIGHT? WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT. IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS TO GET THIS THING DONE, BUT WHEN YOU ARE A DEVELOPER FROM NEW YORK OR A DEVELOPER ANYWHERE, GETTING FINANCING IS ALWAYS NOT SO HARD. THE BIDEN-HARRIS PLAN WOULD ALSO INCREASE REFUGEE ADMISSIONS BY OVER 700%. THINK OF THAT REFUGEE ADMISSION. WE CALL IT THE MANIFESTO BETWEEN JOE AND CRAZY BERNIE AND AOC PLUS 3, 2, YOU KNOW? SHE'S A GREAT STUDENT. SHE'S A GREAT STUDENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT. YOU KNOW SHE DREW UP A PLAN. HOW MANY DAYS YOU THINK SHE SPENT AT HER COLLEGE STUDYING THE ENVIRONMENT? THREE? THEY PLEDGED TO ELIMINATE ALL NATIONAL SECURITY TRAVEL BANS. THEY WILL OPEN THE FLOODGATES TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. MICRON PRESIDENT MACRON IS DOING A GOOD JOB. I'M KEEPING THE TERRORISTS AND EXTREMISTS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. KEEP IN THE HELL KEEP THEM THE HELL OUT. I INSTITUTED A BAN AND THEY SAID I WAS A BAD GUY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I WILL BE A BAD GUY. DOES ANYBODY OBJECT TO THE BAN ON RADICAL ISLAMISTS COMING IN? WE INVESTED 2.5 TRILLION DOLLARS IN REBUILDING OUR U.S. MILITARY. IT IS THE BEST AND STRONGEST IT HAS EVER BEEN, ALL MADE IN THE USA, WITH THE BEST EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD. HAD YOUR SONIC ROCKETS GO HYPERSONIC ROCKETS GO SEVEN TIMES FASTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW. THINK ABOUT IT. WE HAVE THE GREATEST MILITARY WE HAVE EVER HAD. WHEN I CAME HERE FIRST, THE WORLD'S MOST OVERRATED GENERAL SAID TO ME, SIR, WE HAVE NO AMMUNITION. I SAID THAT'S NOT GOOD. NO PRESIDENT SHOULD EVER HEAR THAT, BUT WE NOW HAVE AMMUNITION LIKE WE HAVE NEVER HAD AMMUNITION BEFORE, AND FOR OUR VETERANS WE HAVE VETERANS HERE WE PASSED V.A. CHOICE AND V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY, RIGHT? THANK YOU, FELLAS. THANK YOU. EVERYONE SAID THAT COULD NEVER HAPPEN. WE JUST GOT A 91% APPROVAL RATING FROM THE VETS. IT'S NEVER HAPPENED. IT HAS NEVER BEEN ANYWHERE NEAR THAT. YOU EVER REMEMBER, YOU WERE GROWING UP, EVERY NIGHT, THEY WOULD HAVE ON THE NEWS THESE HORROR STORIES AND HOW BADLY THEY WERE YOU DON'T SEE THAT ANYMORE. THEY WILL GO OUT AND FIND A VET THEM PLACE AND SOMEHOW AND YOU WILL SEE IT TONIGHT, THERE HE IS, UNCLE SAM IS UNHAPPY. LOOK AT THIS GUY. YOU LOOK GOOD. WHILE. WOW. WOW. WOW. 105 YEARS OLD. WOW. BEAUTIFUL COUPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 105. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARE, TO ME, ABOUT 68. YOU LOOK DUTIFUL. THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE KILLED THE LEADER OF ISIS. WE TOOK OUT THE MASS MURDER OF AMERICAN TROOPS MASS MURDERER OF AMERICAN TROOPS. SO THE MANIAS DEAD. I WITHDREW UNITED NATIONS DISASTROUS AARON NUCLEAR DEAL. I RECOGNIZE I RAN NUCLEAR DEAL. I OPENED THE EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM, AND INSTEAD OF NEVER-ENDING WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WE HAVE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME VERY CLOSE TO MIDDLE EAST PEACE WITHOUT BLOOD ALL OVER THE SAND. WE JUST SIGNED ANOTHER ONE TODAY. UAE, BAHRAIN, AND TODAY, SUDAN. WE HAVE THEM LINED UP. NOBODY THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. IT TURNS OUT THAT I'M THE PEACE PRESIDENT. NOBODY THOUGHT THAT. THEY USED TO SAY HE WILL BE AT WAR. YOU HAD CROOKED HILLARY, YOU WOULD BE IN A NUCLEAR WAR WITH NORTH KOREA. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT WAR, RIGHT? REMEMBER? BIDEN WILL TRAP US IN NOTHING BUT ENDLESS WARS, MIDDLE EAST WARS, BECAUSE HE HAS NO CLUE. I DID MORE IN SEVEN MONTHS DAN SLEEPY JOE DID THEN SLEEPY JOE DID IN 47 YEARS. GREAT JOB AND A LIMITLESS FUTURE FOR ALL AMERICANS. IT'S A VOTE FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM. A VOTE FOR TRUMP IS A VOTE FOR A GREAT JOB AND A LIMITLESS FUTURE FOR ALL AMERICANS. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA INTO THE MANUFACTURING SUPERPOWER OF THE WORLD AND WE WILL END OUR RELIANCE ON CHINA ONCE AND FOR ALL. IT HAS ALREADY STARTED. WE WILL HIRE MORE POLICE, INCREASE PENALTIES FOR ASSAULTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND WE WILL BAN DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES WHERE WE PROTECT CRIMINALS. WE WILL UPHOLD RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, FREE SPEECH, AND THE RIGHT TO LIFE, AND WE WILL KEEP REMEMBER THIS WE WILL HOLD ON TO OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. LET ME PUT IT VERY SIMPLY. BECAUSE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT IS IN SERIOUS YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT WITHOUT ME IS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE. I'LL TELL YOU THINK ABOUT THIS. I SAID THE OTHER DAY, I'M STANDING HERE, WE GOT THE DEMOCRATS, WE GOT THE FAKE NEWS, WE GOT THE BLAME THE LAMESTREAM MEDIA, BIG TECH, RINO'S, REPUBLICANS MOSTLY GOOD, RIGHT 96 APPROVAL RATING IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THE OTHER DAY AND 53% OVERALL 96 PERCENT APPROVAL RATING IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THE OTHER DAY AND 53% OVERALL. THAT SCARES THEM. IN HISTORY WHEN YOU ARE AT 53%, YOU DON'T LOSE ELECTIONS, SO THEY ARE GETTING A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS NOW, BUT YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD ALL THESE DIFFERENT GROUPS, AND HERE WE STAND AND WE HAVE THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEY DON'T. THINK OF IT. WE HAVE THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEY DON'T. AND WE STOP THEM FROM DOING VERY BAD THINGS. WE WILL STRIKE DOWN TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN OUR CITIZENS AND KEEP AMERICA OUT OF THESE ENDLESS, RIDICULOUS, LONG-TERM FOREIGN WARS. 19 YEARS IN AFGHANISTAN THEY ARE ALL COMING HOME. THEY ARE ALL COMING HOME. WE WILL MAINTAIN AMERICA'S UNRIVALED MILITARY MIGHT AND ENSURE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.

         "You see what's going on to the road all the way up here? We have people all the way up. I'll tell you, it was never like that for the last administration. They tell May you know, I'll ask the guys that happened to be with me. They were with the last one to They don't say much. I said it wasn't like that. They said, sir, nothing was like that. It was never like that. And they've got the trump signs and the flags of the American flags all over with a lthough American flags. Thank you very much. Hello, Carson City. Hello, Eyes. Great to be back in Nevada with the thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots. Great people. Can you believe it? 16 days, 16 days. And you know what? 16 days from now, we're going to win the state of Nevada. We're going to win four more years in the White House on. We're gonna keep it going early voting is underway, so get out and vote and they're getting a little worried because certain areas you know, we know we're gonna have a big red wave. We're gonna have a tremendous they know if these fakers back there they know. Hey, no. All you have to do is look at this crowd when did we set this up like two days ago? Will be in Carson City in about two days that the people come out like crazy on the people in the road. Thousands and thousands because they couldn't get in. It's pretty sad when you take an airport and it's not big enough, right? Sir, we have a problem we have in airports. Not big enough. But you know what's happening. So we have the big red wave is gonna happen, and that's gonna happen on November 3rd and a little before for the voting. But you can get out now, right? Michael? They could get out now and they could vote. But, you know, strange things are happening in North Carolina. Ah, lot of people are out there voting. You know, those lines of miles long, miles long and there were a lot of red caps that were there were in caps and they were in badges and they were in those beautiful shirts. A lot of them. They love our country. They worked so hard, but they weren't in devoting for a long time that about four years ago they went out and now they're out. And I think even more so. There's even Mawr enthusiasm now then we had four years ago. Actually, it's hard to believe and I'll say it for the fake news by a lot. So, like, I'll give you an example of Michigan and Michigan. We're supposed to be I probably 80 20 with us on the back, but we're gonna catch him. You know, everyone's expecting we're gonna do well, we should, with all the auto plants being built in Michigan hadn't been built for 42 years, and now they're building them all over the place. Bell. A lot of jobs. They had the best year they ever had. Michigan had the best year. They have a governor that's got it locked down. But now we forced it. Open up. They ruled unconstitutional what she was doing. But here's what's happening. So in Michigan were supposed to be, you know, they're going to take the big lead. Then we were like a racehorse that we're going to catch him with a big red wave because our people like to go and vote. You know, I like to go until but something strange is happening in Michigan is happening in other places. Do but it's happening in Michigan because we're not at 20%. We're leading in the early vote on this Never happened. That's never happened before for the Republicans. It doesn't work that way now. No fairness. Until I won Michigan four years ago, Michigan hadn't been one in decades, many decades by Republican. But we want it. And now we should win it by even more because everything I said that would happen happen to all the plants, all the good economy and everything. Until the China virus came in the plague, the plague from China. But now we're And how do I look? Okay. Do I look okay? Way things today that we couldn't do. We could do things today. We couldn't do. Seven months ago when we got hit with this thing, the whole world got hit with it. They should have kept it in. They could have kept it in. They protected their country. But they didn't protect the world or us Europe. And we will never forget. We will never forget. We had just signed an incredible trade deal. The wasn't dry. And then we got hit by the plague. But we will not forget, but you know, we were doing numbers like the likes of which we've never done before. 160 million people employed. You had the best year you ever had. But almost all states, I could say I don't have to do a lot of research. Almost every state was having the best year they ever had. And then we closed it up and we saved over two million lives by doing what we did. You know, they don't like to say that you get a great job, but we're now doing the vaccines. They're coming out very soon. Very strong. Great companies. Johnson and Johnson fights a lot of modern, a great company. There's a lot more than that. But they also have Ah lot of other things. And I would, you know, they call them Therapeutics. For me, it was a cure. I mean, what's the difference? I said, give me a definition. Because I wasn't feeling exactly I wasn't like, Oh, G, I feel great. Okay? I hate to admit I didn't feel, you know, I haven't been somebody that's had a lot of problems with that stuff, so I hate to admit it, but, you know what? I was not feeling great. Does that make sense to you? That wasn't exactly feeling the best. But the great thing is, when you're president, you have so many doctors. I was saying I was saying to a group this morning. I said I had so many had 12 doctors around the bed and everyone was grabbing a different part of my body. I didn't on. They're all super geniuses, but I was not feeling good. And then they gave me this Regeneron, which is an antibody Onda great company. Great great company. Tremendous success with cures, vaccines, other things on. They actually came up with the Ebola drug which saved so many lives. They came up with a lot of good stuff and the other ones too. But this was one I liked because it just seemed to have a very good record, but it was brand new, Hadn't been tested, hadn't been approved or anything, By the way, we're approving it for everybody that needs it. Free of charge. Because it wasn't your fault on Eli Lilly makes a drug based on the same concept. Eli Lilly, Great company from Indiana. Great state, Great state. Because I want to buy a lot. You know, every state that I win by a lot or win by a little we're happy with. And by the way, we're leading. You know, in the state of Nevada, you better get out of why wouldn't way. But anyway, I took this drug. I wasn't feeling good. It's Ah, transfusion, as they say, like one hour. And the next day, I felt like supermen. I got up. I said, What the hell is going on? Block. Whoa! I felt like supermen. I said, Come on, bring him on. Bring him on. Whoever it is now, I felt good and I could have left. I could. I wanted to leave the hospital. Then there's a circuit. We have a couple of days, please. But these doctors air Great. I love you too. I love you. Change. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. But these doctors in greater we could do things today. Seven months ago was unheard of. Really? The whole antibody thing was was you know, what they've done is incredible with the therapeutics and all of the vaccines that you're gonna see coming on board right now. So you know, I say you get out there and things are opening up. Tell your governor to open up. Tell her everybody toe open up. I told Michigan Michigan we sue and they found her. She was It was unconstitutional. The only person that her state was opened up for was her husband. He was allowed to go and sail this boat, do whatever the hell he wanted to, but nobody else could do anything. They were, like, locked in the prison. And it's very bad, you know, that causes a lot of problems that causes with the alcohol and drugs and depression and suicide, believe it or not. And the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. So I can't do it right. So if you vote for May and you know what's gonna happen, let me change it when you vote for way, have a lot of people here. Is there anybody that's gonna vote for sleepy Joe in this crowd? Please? Not too many, Not too many sleepy Joe. I can't even believe it should have never even gotten the nomination. It was Bernie's nomination until Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas split up the vote. But let's change it when you vote for May. Prosperity will search. Your taxes will be cut even further. And I gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. Theo Pandemic is rounding the turn it around and we have the vaccines coming and they go crazy. The factors. But I will tell you it's rounding the turn with or without its rounding the turn, you'll see that normal life. That's all we want. We want normal life, right or normal. Just way. Wanna be where we were seven months ago? Right Will fully resume The Nevada Tourism and hospitality industry, which is fantastic, will come roaring back and it will. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. For every unless somebody like Sleepy Joe Biden wants to substantially increase your taxes and your regulation, you know, we cut your regulations used to take up to 21 years to get a highway approved. Can you believe in 21 years You ever see the big charts where showed you have to go here, here, here, then back take years and years. It could be 21 years, and then they get none of that 21 years and then they disapprove it. Okay, you know, how would you like to have that job? After 21 years, you're going for a vote and then you lose 3 to 2, and that's the end of that. So a big portion of your life was trying to get something approved, and we have it down to two years. I think I have it down to one year, and it may be disapproved if it's environmentally not good. If it's unsafe, it may be. But it's gonna be one year, two years, and most likely it will be approved and it will get done. He wants to terminate our newfound energy independence, and that's what he wants. Todo He wants to end fracking, you know? Do you ever see this guy? For a year and a half? There will be no fracking, no fracking, no fracking. Then he goes thio a great place, Pennsylvania. And they say, by the way, we have a million jobs for fracking. Oh, we will have fracking. We will have. And the fake news doesn't even talk to him about it. They don't ask him like well, how come for a year and a half. You said there's no fracking. And then as soon as you get the nomination, you say this fracking. Remember Hillary? She said, No call, no clean coal note call. Forget it. Then three weeks later, she had to go toe know him up. You mean him up? Because you see what's happening with Biden so corrupt. He is a corrupt politician. But did you see Hillary? And then she goes to West Virginia and she said, Oh, well, actually I like call, but it was a little bit too late. It was a little bit too late. You got record low numbers. West Virginia, great place. They don't like it when somebody says you can't dig coal. That was not good. But Biden wants to launch a socialist takeover of health. Care to cut our military budget on. He wants to cut it right to the bone. Well, the Democrats do not like our military. They always, you know. Traditionally, we have built the greatest military any time that we've ever had anywhere in the If you vote for Biden, he will surrender your jobs to China. He will surrender your future to the virus. He's gonna lock down. Just go. Once the lock down, he'll listen to the scientists. If I listen totally to the scientists, we would right now have a country that would be in a massive depression instead of were like a rocket ship. Take a look at the numbers. And that's despite the fact that we have, like, five or six of these Democrats keeping their states closed because they're trying to hurt us on November 3rd. But the numbers are so good. Anyway, they'd be even better, but New York should be open. Michigan now has to open because of the court case. North Carolina should be open. They should be open. You guys. You wanna open? Yeah. You wanna open? Pennsylvania has toe open. I mean, you know, way have places. And sometimes they're open, but they're partially open. They're not open like they should be. Get the places open. Let's go. Let's see. Oh, but he will surrender your country to the radical Socialist left. You see that happening? This election is a choice between a trump super recovery which we're in right now. Or a Biden depression. You will have a depression first of all, your taxes, they're gonna be quadrupled. You will have a depression, the likes of which we have not seen since 1929. That's what's gonna happen on. I'm very good at those things. You will have one of the great depressions of all time, your taxes. They're gonna go up your regulations, they're going to go up. Everybody's gonna be leaving our country. All those jobs and companies that I brought in, they're all going back to where they came from. All he wants to do is raise it even in the companies who wants to raise it for the company. So they go back to another location. They came because we cut taxes. Now he wants to raise their taxes. They will leave. It's very simple, you know, it's one of those things. It's a choice between strong borders or no borders between supporting the police or defunding the police between delivering a vaccine and record time to kill the virus or a Biden shutdown to kill the economy on November 3rd, vote for jobs, safety, lower taxes, a secure Second Amendment and freedom. There's a lot of people here. Look at that. A lot of people I wish the cameras would show it. They never show it right. They never show it. They show me and you know what happens over my shoulders. About three or four people, three people. They're always complaining. I don't see mI mean, there's a lot of masks on a mask now. They're corrupt people. But Joe Biden is from a failed and corrupt political class that enriched itself while draining the economic life and soul from our country. Guys been here for 47 years. It's an amazing I do something, he says. Oh, I would have done if he's been here for 47 years now, all of a sudden, he says, Oh, we should have done this when I closed and put a ban on China coming and heavily infected, I saved thousands, probably hundreds of thousands of lives, he said. I was xenophobic. I shouldn't have done it. Months later, he agreed it was the right thing to do. Now he goes out. I should have done it sooner, and yet he didn't want me to do it. Months later, these people, I don't know how they get away with it. You know why? Because those people are more corrupt than anybody they don't even ask. They don't even ask him. For the last 47 years, they shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, let drugs pour into our country and all over our great communities. And they ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless, ridiculous foreign wars in countries that you never even heard off. By the way, they're all coming back. They've been coming back. People don't like to hear it. People don't like the reporter coming back rapidly. He's a servant of the wealthy donors, globalists and special interests who got rich bleeding America dry and putting America last. As your president, I could have been the greatest fundraiser of all time. You know, you see these numbers that they're raised raised 300 million. Know why when they raise money, that's a deal. They're making deals. I would be the single greatest fundraiser in history. I'll call up the head of Goldman Sachs. I'll call up that of all these Wall Street guys, most of my know or know enough about. I know more. I know I know too much and I could call up. Listen, do me a favor would you give 10 million to my campaign? Yes, Mr President. Would you give 20 million to? Yes, but But you know, when you do that, you have to say anything when they call you in three months and they say we need help with this or that or that. It's, you know, very hard, like, sort of almost morally they did for you. And you do for them. And it doesn't have to be a a deal or a quid pro quo like he had right, like he had with the billion dollars to get his son out of problems with the prosecutor on. They never asked him about that either. But I would be the greatest fundraiser of all time. But I don't like to do that because it puts us at a disadvantage on. We never want to be in a disadvantage. So easy to think of it. The president calls, I'll give me whatever the hell I want. Yeah. 2016. You voted to fire this corrupted and decrepit political establishment and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first. Joe Biden is and always has been a corrupt politician. He always has been. And as far as I'm concerned, the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. It really is looking. What's going on? It's a criminal. You know? I don't know what's going on with the, you know, the Democrats. A very powerful party. But it's not the Democrats. It's the Democrats, plus the fake news media. And then it's also including big tech. Okay, here it is. It's me. I'm all you have between your Second Amendment and chaos and all the problems. It's me. I'm all you have and the Republicans. I love the Republicans, and we have some great right. But they have to learn to stick together better. You know, we have some stupid people, you know, way have some stupid people. Some of them are gone. Flake, Corker, they're gone. But now we have this guy sass, you know, wants to make a statement. Little Ben. Little Ben says the Republicans have to stick together better. You don't see that one thing I respect about the democrats. They stick together. You know what they have? Lousy policy. They want open borders. They want sanctuary cities. They want a lot of they want to raise your They want a quadruple your taxes. But the one thing is, they stick together. The Republicans have to learn. They gotta stick together. I don't know. And by the way, it's been that way for decades. I don't know what the hell is in the blood. Could you explain that to me, please? Michael? Uh, what the hell is going on? It's been that way for many decades. I don't know. There's always a few. They want to make a statement. Hey, since a bunch of website. Very good. Now I love them. They've been great. Hey, look on on the impeachment hoax. I couldn't do better. The 197 to nothing in the house. Republicans on We even had the Democrat or to come and join us, right? That was an impeachment over a telephone call. That was perfect. Other than that think of that. But 197 to nothing. And with the Senate 52 a half to a half, who is the half? I can't think of it. Oh, Biden couldn't think he couldn't remember Dave, right? He couldn't remember the name. You know the guy. The guy from I think he was a governor. I'm not sure or not. What is he? A senator? Yeah. What's his name? Mitt Romney. That's right. That's he didn't. number which I thought was insulting to Mitt Romney. I wouldn't insult Mitt Romney that way. Okay, but Biden couldn't remember his name. You know, they've only known each other for about 35 years now. Biden. Look, Biden is gone. Let's not kid ourselves. We wanna be nice. Biden is gone. Zo, can you imagine having Kamala Most liberal member of Garden, the most liberal member of Congress And I think that whole thing That's why Nancy Pelosi is talking about the 25th Amendment. That's the real reason they want to get him the hell out. The Bidens make crooked Hillary Clinton look like an absolute amateur on. She's pretty bad. And I do want to hear from law enforcement. Why are they looking at? Maybe they are, and I hope they are. You know, I try and stay out of it because I'm trying very hard to be so right down the middle. But why aren't they looking at the fact that you got a subpoena from the United States Congress for 33,000 emails and she deleted every single one of them and then acid washed them on? Then she pounded her telephones with a hammer. I've gotten rid of cell phones and I throw them away, you know, Now I throw him into the Secret Service. Okay, I give them back. But before this, I throw him away. I get a new one, right? She pounded the out of him with a hammer. How many people have gotten rid of your cell phones and pounded them to death with a hammer? So I just want to know why aren't they looking at that? Why are they looking at that? Why aren't they looking at Omar? Omar? Ilhan Omar? Yeah, but the biggest of them all is Joe. He's corrupt. And they found the laptop. You know what they call that? The laptop from hell. That is a laptop. That's a laptop from hell. Let's see what happens with it. Let's see what happens with it. So a giant trove of emails show Hunter Biden making deals, setting up meetings with his father Joe and using the office of the vice president for a for profit cash machine. It's what it is. This guy's a vacuum cleaner. He follows his father around and takes millions, hundreds of millions and billions of dollars out of these countries. I mean, that is so dishonest. That's so crooked. He is. I call him the Human Vacuum cleaner, right? You know those things on television. He's better than any one of them. Joe Biden said he knew nothing, but he lied because they have this. I'm telling you, this laptop is a disaster. The fake news and big tech don't want to write about it, though They don't want anything to do with it. And they punished and thank you to the New York Post. It's unbelievable what they're doing. You know, it's the fifth or fourth watches newspaper, so you call it the mainstream, not the lame stream, but the mainstream media. But it's the I guess, the fourth largest. It's the oldest newspaper in the U. S. E Think was Alexander Hamilton founded it, right? And they should be very proud of what they're doing because The New York Times refuses to write about it. And the fake Washington Post, which is a total fake, You know, that's a lobbyist for Bezos and the group. Okay for Amazon, but hey, calls it the lobbyist. He must call it that. I call it the Lobbyist. Okay, you're in The Washington Post. You have a little power. It's a free lobbyist, although it's probably not a free one. That probably cost him a fortune, but it gives him what he needs. But it's fake. And if you look at NBC and MSNDC right. And if you look at ABC, how about Stephanopoulos the other day? You know, he interviewed me two weeks. He gave me a tough interview, but I didn't consider it unfair, although turned out, the audience was stacked against me. There were some trump people and some biting people, and some people I know didn't work out that way, did it? And actually, they were very nice, right? The one woman said how handsome You know, the one woman? No, I'd rather have that. I'd rather have that than have her say. You're a wonderful politician. Dealt with that. I'd rather have a What's better than that? Right, Michael, you're so handsome. You have such a great smile. But see, here's what happened with her. She was so nice, but she was supposed to be like, I think, a former Hillary supporter. But the way she said it to me, it was so nice and then after the show and she said it right. Did anyone say that it was so lovely? And then after the show, she went rogue. I wouldn't vote for him. I went. In other words, they said, Wait a minute, this isn't that the earlier I'm sure that the Democrats, together with their partner, ABC Television Network, said What the hell happened with her? That's a terrible thing that she did. So I'm sure they hit her very hard and she got back in line, okay? But I think hopefully her first statement was the statement. She believed he's a handsome man. See, now the fake news Well, say President Trump went on a rant, talking about how answer me is. They don't understand. He went on a rent. It was a terrible thing. We don't think he's handsome. Actually, they think I must be the most unattractive human being they've ever seen. Except what they don't realize is without me, they will have ratings that will nosedive. They'll go out of business, every one of them, right? Right. You know, I'm making this speech a little bit longer than I'm looking at this crazy Nevada son, and I'm sitting here with his white skin. But who the hell cares if I get a little sun burner? Yeah, they don't wanna write about a report on the scandal because they want Biden to win. You know, I've always said in the end, they're gonna all endorse May, because if Biden wins there at a business, this is the most boring human being I've ever seen. But they want Biden to win so they can take over a country because they will take it over between big tech. Section 2 30 by the way. All right, go ahead. Now, Joe, No, no. Now that it'll be, it'll be one of the great. It'll be one of the great disasters. I'm telling you. Depression. Just remember the word and you know it. And California, you from California, Dio Come on, Gabe. Let's go, Gabe. Come on, Gabe. Two years ago. You know I just left. I'll tell you what. So I just left California, and I was in a place that was sort of Republican, but I was with a wonderful reporter. I just spoke to him from the Washington Times, which is a really good newspaper, by the way, and he reported very strongly The crowds were unbelievable, unbelievable. And I don't know why we wouldn't win California. We're playing it a little bit. In theory, you're not supposed to be able, but they have everything against them. High crime, homeless. They don't take care of the homeless. I tell Nancy Pelosi, come back to San Francisco and take care of your homeless. Nancy Theo. Endless forest fires their endless I do. I like the governor. But I said, Do you ever stop with these forest fires? Can you ever stop? They gotta manage the forest, you know? They talk it Z. It's all sorts of reasons. They gotta manage the forest, manage it. It's called Forest Management, but they got to stop. They got to stop. And now they have a new thing. They're running out of water and you know they've run out of electricity. There brownouts, blackouts. What's going on? A lot of people are leaving. They're leaving for Texas. They're leaving for Texas. They're leaving for Florida. They're leaving for places that are really well, but it's very interesting. A big thing the other day they're going to ration their water in California commit, and I felt so badly I called up his It is. Oh, do you have a what? They dio millions of gallons on our come down from the north. Poor downpour down. So it's they have so much right. They have so much water, but they routed into the Pacific Ocean because they have a smelt, right? Is it a smell? How's that for a memory? Good? There's no problem there as there's no smell. Well, thank you. It's a little tiny fish, and it's been having difficulty over the last long time. With water without water is having difficulty, but they want to save the smelt and in saving the smell that destroying human lives right on their destroying the farmers and even Los Angeles, the homes. So they have a thing where they're bringing it down, ultimately to 42 gallons of person. And that sounds like a lot. Look, if somebody said you could have 42 gallons of person, I think a day it sounds like a lot of water, right? It's not. It's like a quick shower and let's wash your hands. Then they have a mandate. Wash your hands at all times. You must always, constantly. What? Then? They say 42 got. Say, Wait a minute. Okay, I got a deal. I won't take a shower for the next couple of weeks that way. No, it's true. So 42 gallons It sounds like a lot, but it's really not a friend of mine. He has this massive house. He says I'm not gonna be able to take a shower. I live in the house is gorgeous house, right? Can take a shower. Wash your hands every hour every 15 minutes. You know what I did? I tell you this crazy. So you know what bothers me when you go into a new hotel in new house? They have these force. It's right. And you tell them when the water comes out. Even if you live in like North Carolina, you live in areas where up in New England you live. Most of our country has so much what we don't know what to do with. The problem is how do you get rid of it? But they do for, like, the desert like here. But they do for areas that are a little bit tougher for water. But even you have the water, so they do it. So they come up with this one regulation for all over the country. So you're going to a hotel or you buy a house and they have what's called a restrictor. Yeah, look at it. They're all donning. Same thing, by the way. Same thing with your dishwasher. I freed that up to the dishwashers. They had a little problem. They didn't give enough water like so people would run them 10 times. So they end up using more water. And the thing is no damn good. We freed it up. Now you can buy a dishwasher and comes out and beautiful go by a dishwasher. Go buy those companies. I said, what's wrong with this thing? It doesn't clean the dishes, right? The women come up to me. The women who they say don't like me. They actually do like me a lot again. Yeah. Suburban women. Please vote for me. I'm saving your house. I'm saving your community. I'm keeping your crime way down. I keep hearing now they keep you know it's all fake stuff. Remember? They said last time about women, women will never vote. He will never vote for Donald Trump. They'll never vote. Then the end of the evening. You know the real crying. Oh, my God. What happened? Remember John King? What's going on over here? Yeah, the red, red, Red. He won Florida home if he won. Florida wasn't that I won. Florida wanted, like fast. And by the way, we're way up in Florida right now because we've done a great job. Okeechobee. We've done a great job. We've done things for Florida that nobody thought could ever be done. But anyway, but John King So he's up there. He won Florida. Oh, well, that was quick. But the big you know, when? When we went Ohio. Because did you ever hear for a year and a half? When we're thinking about doing this, you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ah ha. Right. You heard that 100 times. They were doing that for may stick, and then I get these polls. I had great people in Ohio. They said, sir, you're gonna win Ohio. Don't Even you don't even have to come back. You're gonna win. By the way, they said that to me again just recently, but they said you cannot win. So we ended up winning Ohio by eight points, and it wasn't that we want Ohio. But the polls closed at seven o'clock and at seven a clock and one second because, you know, unless you win Big Michael, right? Have you know they keep you waiting? So the polls have closed in the great state of Ohio. Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. They kept saying I was even. We had groups. They said I was. I'll tell you how accurate the polls were four years ago, I was down in nine states. The day of the election. I won all 96 Okay, what? Other than that, they were quite accurate. Actually, this time they're much better. You want to know the truth this time? They're actually much better now, but we're doing much better. And as I said, we have much more enthusiasm now. But anyway, getting back to my very boring story about faucets and dish work. So I said to the head, I called up great dishwasher company from Ohio that we saved, by the way. And so what's the problem with the dishwasher, average people. They don't give us any water. I mean, you know, be nice to be able to get enough water. What's the problem? We need more water. Not that much, but give. Like I said, how much you need this? Would you like more? I'd love MAWR. Would you give us Will give you more. You have so much. What do you don't know what to do with it, right? So I gave them what they need. And now the dishwashers are incredible. They work beautifully and you go one time and you come back and your dishes air nice and beautiful and clean and dry. You don't have to go 10 times the same thing with the restrictions in the faucet. So I hate to say the three things. It's the shower, It's the sink. And, you know, the third element in the bathroom. But I don't say it because every time I say it, they only talk about that one because it sort of grows to talk about right. So I won't. I won't talk about the fact that people have to flush their toilet 15 times. Okay, I will not talk about it. I'll only talk about showers and okay, but there is three things. I won't talk about it this way. They can't report. They can't report it. So what happens? So what happens? I go with my people. Environmental people. Why are we doing this? Because when you wash your hands, it takes you five times longer. You know, the waters that come. You get soap. You can't get it off. I said open it up. They said, What do you mean? Take the restrictor, Zoff. People know. And if you're out here, you got to be careful and you gotta do all the things you've been doing. Anyway. Take the restrictor is off and you may leave it in certain areas where you might need it. But most of the country Big portion, It doesn't need it. Then on the shower, the worst you ever get under a shower where no water comes out. And may I want that hair to be so beautiful, right? A suit e want herto look there I go into some of these hotels. You know, your travel. I go into these hotels, new hotels, they do. And I said it's not their fault, and I get in there and say, Oh, I could look at it Now I know that everything I say. Oh, here we go. Turn on the water drip, drip, drip, drip, drip. But now you go into a shower and the water pours out. You go into ah, sink and you can wash your hands very nicely. Beautiful. And the third thing don't worry about Okay, we won't talk. There's one time, that's all. So I'm not just running against Biden, but you watch. They'll be talking about the third thing they won't. I've done this before and they never even talk about sinks and showers, so I never talk. Did you see how dishonest running against a left wing media, big tech giants and a corrupt political class and a corrupt Democratic party. You saw what they did. They spied on my campaign and got caught. They tried to take down the president of the United States, but they went after the wrong president. Let me tell you something. I really believe this. Somebody said it just today. Any other president would not have been able to withstand, but we've done it would be in a corner with their thumb in their mouth, saying, Please take me home to Mommy, Please. These people are evil. Even shift today, you know, shifty shift. So, did you hear the new one? I was waiting for this. So they find this horrible, horrible laptop of Hunter. Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? But Joe is far more corrupt than Hunter because Joe knew every Joe's getting a piece of everything. They have it in the email 10% and 50%. But Joe is far more corrupt than hunter. But what happens is they say, where's Hunter? And they see what's going on. Everybody is looking for him. Everybody wants to find, and all we're hearing is that you can't talk about this kind of thing. You can't. Can you imagine if that were Don Trump Juniors laptop or Eric Trump was such a fun. These are These are good kids, but they have just been brutalized by these maniacs. Or what about our great Ivanka Trump? Can you imagine Tiffany? Even Baron, right, Baron? No, they're all good kids. But could you imagine? You know, the problem. Okay. He got healed in about 15 seconds, right? You gotta understand that. You know the young kids, Was it 99.9 something They said Baron tested positive. Even I wasn't worried. You know, he's strong. He's definitely tall, He's tall and he's a good kid. He's a good kid, smart kid. But they said Sir Baron tested first yourself. I said, Well, yeah. Are you gonna give him anything, though, Like, two seconds later, I said, How's Baron? Oh, he's except he beat it. I hate to say it. They have a much stronger immune system than we do. I hate to say that, you know, I said, Congratulations, Baron. I said, That was quick. I said, How did it feel? I don't know, but the Democrats and this horrible group of people, they have nothing but disdain for you and for your values. They lecture you on the need for open borders while they live behind gated communities like Nancy Pelosi. She doesn't want a wall, but she lives in this very beautiful house with lots of good ice cream. They support crippling lockdowns Well, their jobs remain totally exempt. They keep your kids out of school while their kids and their families have private tutors right they want to take away your guns. They want to destroy your Second Amendment while they employ armed guard. And it's time that we sent them a very strong message because they're hypocrites in Washington, D. C. And in Silicon Valley. How did she look on Valley Section 2 30 on Election Day? Not everybody understands that, but we have some great politicians here today that understand. But on Election Day, you can send a message to the fake news media right there to the big tech companies and to the Washington swamp. We never knew it could be this deep when I said Drain the swamp, I didn't know is this bad? But send him a message that they will never forget. Show them that the American people are still in charge by delivering sleepy Joe Biden and the Democrats a thundering defeat on November 3rd on. If I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician. I've dealt in politics for a long time. I know him very well. I know I'm all very well. I've felt for a long time. I know them all. If I do not thank you very much. If I do not always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for you harder than anyone ever. Uh huh. All right, thank you very much. By the way, did you see Biden this when he was very agitated you to get agitated? He was very agitated and he's screaming. And he had nobody in the audience. He had a couple of cars. Did you see it? The hunk in the I can't believe it. And they don't report that, You know, we got lucky. I think the camera man slipped in. The camera went a little off kilter because they just like we want them to show our crafts. They don't want them. I love watching those circles. He's got those big, big there so well done. The the best thing about his campaign is the guy or woman that does the circles. You know, there's a lot of talent that they're perfect, you know, I'm into like I'm a perfectionist. Frankly, I am. It's always a good builder. Look at those circles, very thick and very far apart. I think you've got about six of them because that's the number of people that show up this way, he could say We were sold out Today I'm fighting against forces who want to destroy everything that you love and cherish People think of. Joe Biden is a nice man, but he's not a nice man. No, he's not a nice man. He was never a nice man, and he was never a smart man. He got lucky. He got lucky that Pocahontas didn't quit earlier. And he's not a good man. He's a corrupt man. And he took an ad against me knowing it was false. You probably know the ad. It's a horrible, vicious ad having to do with the military. It's a totally false, horrible, horrible ad, and nobody has ever done more for the military than I have nobody on. We advised him and his group of dishonest cronies legally and every other way. We advised them, and we let him know we're putting complaints in all over the place. But he took a vicious, vicious, horrible ad of something I never said. It was a magazine that's an Obama type magazine with Obama and Biden and Crooked Hillary. It's a third. I won't even mention that third rate magazine loses a fortune. It's and they made up a story and they said I said certain things. There's no human being on Earth unless they're seriously, seriously deranged That would say such a thing And I said it in front of other soldiers and I have 26. I think witnesses saying It's ridiculous. Number one. You wouldn't need any witnesses. Nobody would say anything like that. But we said it never happened. They have no witnesses. They have, I think, an anonymous source. But the source doesn't exist. It was made up. It was made up just like the Russia Russia Russia was made up, so they made it a. They made up this lie and now it's in television commercials. Like I said it and frankly, if I were a military person and if I saw that ad, I would never vote for Trump and I told my people there's a very serious thing. They took a statement, made up a statement just like they do. That's what they do their vicious, horrible people. They made up a statement and now they put ads in during a football game. I see an ad I'm watching the game. I mean, I must tell you, I'm not into football so much anymore, you know. No, I'm not. It's hard to watch. I love people that honor our anthem and honor our flag on our Thank you very much. Thank you. And you look at the basketball. Do you see the basketball readies? Final good down. 70 77 70%. Who the hell? I didn't I didn't watch one shot. No interest? No. No. We want people. You know what? People wanna watch sports. I wanna watch. We have enough of us, right? Have enough of us. There's plenty of us, but down 70%. I mean, in one way, it's a shame in another way. You know, when we had this argument with the NFL two years ago, it really hurt them badly. They were down 25 30% right? People weren't going to the games. And I thought we won the battle. I thought it was over. Then I saw Roger, Nice guy Roger Goodell in his basement wearing a blue T shirt. Tight, very tight. You know, like he's a player. It doesn't work. I don't wanna have a tight one. I wanted this loose is possible, but he's wearing a tight renews, thinks he's all buffed up on everything. Didn't look no tie. You know, just a T shirt, like an undershirt that's painted blue. That's a blue color. I don't even think it had anything on it. And he said, We've decided to do this and that and I said, There goes the NFL right down the tubes and nobody was there. This was during I think August. Nobody was even talking about it. The hell is he doing? And here it goes again. Nobody cares about football because of it, and I don't know how many chances they're going to get, but they ought to get smart because they can't win this war. We want people that love our country. We don't want this crap. If a player is making 25 million dollars a year doing something he'd be doing anyway on the weekend, okay, because he loves playing football. And if somebody is making 10 million for blocking or 25 million for throwing and they say what a horrible country we're living, we can't do pinto, and you know what? I want them to protest. I think if they want to protest, they cannot. This reason there's always a reason to protest They can, but not then and not sitting on the knee instead of standing proudly with your hand on your heart. And, you know, in the contract they have a clause you have to stand hand on heart. They actually have, I think, hand on heart. But they don't want to exercise it because they're weak. The weak people and weak people is what got our country in trouble. You talk about week Joe Biden, Joe Biden and the Socialists. We'll kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders, confiscate your guns and impose a $4 trillion tax like on your companies and yourselves. Fortunate, you know, four trillion is That's the largest tax hike in the history and you know what they're going to do with it. They're gonna spend it on the green New Deal conceived by the brilliant AOC plus three, a poor student with absolutely no environmental experience, right. They want to attack religious liberty, drive God from the public square and destroy your suburbs. I say that to the women because I keep here and they said the women from the suburbs? No. I think the women from the suburbs are looking for a couple of things. One of them is safety. One of them is good, strong security. And one of them is They don't wanna have low income housing built next to their house. And you know who makes up 30% of your suburbs? Minorities? African Americans, right? Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, Minorities. Okay, people think Is it racist? Racist? It's the opposite. I've had them come to me and people come to me, say thank you so much, but they keep talking about the women from the suppers. I said, I think we're gonna have a big resounding What the hell happened with women to the servers? They really like Trump a lot. No Onley vote for me if you're a woman from the suburbs and you know I shouldn't say this because they'll bring it up. But one time early been doing this that long, right? You know I haven't been done. I have guys have been running, sir, I've been running for 40 years. I said, Well, I've only run for two years, but I became president. You didn't. But you know, But you know, it's sort of interesting because I really think that women from the suburbs they're gonna like Trump because I think it's gonna be one of the big, because that's it. It is. It is about safety. It is about safety. And when you see what happens in our cities with a run and ransack and they they're anarchists and you know what they say the suburbs, they actually say the suburbs air next. And just so you know, just so you know, so important thes air Democrat, run states and cities Republicans air doing great and we're not gonna let this happen, and we'll stop it. We want a resounding victory. We're going to stop it. But the suburbs air next. But I did say, you know, early on I said housewives from the suburbs they went after me when I said that. Let me ask you, the women from the suburbs Do you mind when we say housewives? Eliza, you go? No, they're also, but I'll do it too politically. Correct? Anyway, if you don't, I'll say women. But I said housewives or the suburbs, it went crazy. Donald Trump. He wasn't politically correct. I said. Michael Biden supports cutting police funding, abolishing cash bail. You know you get a murderer. Let's let him out. Let's I'm walking to So you see what's happening in New York? What they're doing to New York, our governor, What he's doing to New York is horrible. And he called law enforcement sleepy. Joey called law enforcement recently the enemy. No, no, law enforcement has done an incredible job, and you're always gonna have a bad apple. You're always gonna have somebody that chokes. You know, they have, like, a quarter of a second. You ever see where they have You ever see the test with a somebody Slash is open the door, you got a quarter of a second and they could be on the force for 30 years. But that's a hard thing to do, right? And you're gonna have people they choke, like in sports. You see, if they choke, some people choke, then you have Jack Nicklaus and you have Tiger and you have great people that tend to choke a lot less. But, you know, some people choke and it's not their fault. It's just the way it is you have a quarter of a second to make a decision. Quarter of a second. Think of it. Joe Biden and the Democrat Party have waged a war on police on cops and inciting riots. And that's what you do when you take away the majesty of that position. You are inciting violence when you when you allow people to loot stores and you have the police standing back and they want to go in and doing a job and they could do it so easy, you don't even need us to bring in the National Guard like we did in Minneapolis like we were ready to do in Seattle. And then they gave up the night before because they didn't want to play games. I was. I was so disappointed when they gave up. I was The one I really want to do is Portland. That's gonna be so easy, you know, we have to be invited and the governor doesn't want I call her. I said, Governor, let us go in, give us 30 minutes, Governor. But you know what? I don't want to violate? It would be good, I guess if I did. But we have to be invited in and the city? It's the craziest thing. These air anarchists That would be the easier. One would love to go in and do something big with Chicago. That's actually a bigger problem. That's actually a bigger problem. Hard the easy one of the anarchists in the middle of the street that hate our country Hate our cops. You saw them. They killed this young man, right? They shot him in the street and a day went by. They knew the guy and they didn't arrest him. Another day went by. They didn't. I called down and said, What's going on? They didn't arrest me, knew who he was. They knew where he waas they didn't want. They would have never. So I sent in our great U S. Marshals. They were so happy, You know, the law enforcement. They love our country. They were so happy And this guy was a killer. He said they had other crimes to buy the bad ones. But he shot this young man right in the middle of the street. Shot him. You heard the bullet ring out. You heard the people screamed. They know who it waas. They said That was so And so So after 2.5 days, I said, Go and get him. 15 minutes. It was all over. It was all that was it? It's all of here in Nevada, riders burned the city of Reno on during the violent demonstrations in Las Vegas. A 29 year old police was deliberately shot in the head while he was doing his job. Think of it. You know who that was, right? You know who he is? Waas Joe Biden Zero. So right. You know who are focus of his partners Were we talked to a lot of the people that were there. Think his partners here. But I want to tell you we can't let this happen. They've taken away the respect. You have to let them do their job. They'll do it. Well, you can't have. Remember in Minneapolis, where the mayor ordered the police to leave the premises, right? Seattle leave the premises and then they took over the police department. You have that You're not gonna have a country. But this is the radical left. This is the radical left. Joe Biden will appease the rioters, looters and anarchists and I'm having them arrested instead. Okay, if you don't mind. And remember, it's all in Democrat cities and states, all in Democrats. If you're a moderate Democrat or a liberal who knows that your party has gone totally off the rails? We are welcoming you with open arms to the Republican Party. Biden's agenda would also be a catastrophe for Nevada seniors, seniors, any seniors here. Mhm. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. You know that, right? Remember, they used to say, I'm going to cut so well, what happened? I never cut it. Remember that? They said I'm gonna be in wars. You know, that's my personality. They think it's not really It is. If we have to, I'll be better than anybody else. But, you know, you say whatever happened to North Korea, remember, we're supposed to be in a war with with Obama or Hillary or whoever it waas you would have been in a war Obama expected to be in a war that would have been a bad war. Now, by this pledging mass amnesty and free health care for illegal aliens, decimating Medicare and destroying your social security while I am president. No one will touch your Medicare or your Social Security, including me. No one. Under my leadership, we're delivering a safe vaccine and very rapid recovery, and we're all set to deliver it. We have the military ready to deliver it. It's going to be incredibly have a general. That's what he does. He delivers soldiers and delivers everything. This is easy for them. It will be delivered very, very rapidly. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine and annihilate Nevada's economy with the draconian, unscientific locked down. Because, you know, they're finding out these lockdowns aren't working. Look at Europe having this massive surge. They've been locked down. Okay, look at these lockdowns. You've been locked down, and now they're having a search. Look at Michigan. Michigan has search. Well, who's been tougher than her? She ran it like a prison. She was like a warden, right? And they have a search. And then they say she is doing a wonderful job. I don't think I think she's doing a terrible job, By the way. I know all of the governors. You know, we basically deal with governors. The governors run their states. We give him the equipment. We helped him out. We got them all of the ventilators. We did an incredible job with that. Jared Kushner did a great job. We had so many. We had so many. No, he did an incredible job, but he got these guys from Silicon Valley. Nobody understood. We didn't e mean ventilators, right? No. But you know, for that they're good. I have to tell. They came in. Everybody said These things are complicated. They walked in like that's got to be the simplest piece of equipment we've ever seen. And we now have become the ventilator. I mean, we're making thousands and thousands a month that we're actually giving a We don't need any, but we didn't have ventilators. We weren't equipped for a thing like this. Our coverage were empty that governors were. And I got to know all the governors. Some did a great job, and some did a poor job. But when we had our weekly calls with governors, they would say even the biggest enemies, the biggest haters, sir, thank you very much. Or to our great vice president who headed up the task force, Mike Pence. My Oh, did he do well in his debate with her. That was unfair. If that were a fight, they would have stopped it, right. They should have stopped. I said they should have stopped that debate in the middle. That's a great expression, right? Boxing, you know, you learn UFC. If that were a fight, they would accept it. But Mike was great, and he's done great. You did great with this whole thing. But the governors would say on conference calls, all 50 usually almost all over the world because they all wanted everything. You know, their coverage were empty. That was therefore, I guess, you know. But let's say it was therefore, But we had to help him. And we did. We built hospitals for some of them. We built everything. We did a great job, but they would say Thank you very much. Great job, Great job, great job. Every one of them. And if they weren't happy, would make him happy during the call. Because we had the generals and admirals. We had great people, and we took care of her. And it's a great job. Thank you very much, Mr President. Mr. Vice Breath. Thank you very much. Great. job. We're sending a lot of gowns to Michigan. Goggles to Michigan, lots of things. Thio different, all the different states. But she'd say, Great job, Thank you very much. We have it all down. You know, it's all down because I think all those schools, I hope they were taped. Hey, could you imagine if we didn't have my call with the president of Ukraine? If we didn't have that transcript, then it would have been this crazy maniac named Adam Schiff with his phony story that he told to the United States. But we had a transcribed Isn't that a wonderful thing? So I think we have a transcribed or taped, but all the governors, every one of them, great job, great job. Then they go outside and they see the press. You know, they get nervous with the press, these guys, they make them nervous. We're very happy with the job. The president's doing. I said he's no good people, But you know what? Someday I'll tell you the story. We had some great ones, and we had some people that didn't know what the hell they're doing. But I'll let you know what the right time where they were under the Biden locked down. The lights of Reno and Las Vegas were extinguished. Carson City will become, Ah, goes down. If he comes in, Carson City will become Augusta and the Christmas season will be canceled. Look, remember I said we're gonna bring back Christmas, right? The name. Remember? We brought it back, Remember? I used to go around saying we will, because I saw these big department says, You know, they thought it was politically correct. So there's a have a great season. He said no, I don't wanna have a great season. I want to say Merry uh huh. Now they're all saying Merry Christmas again. Yeah. So I just want to introduce a couple of warriors that we're here. We're joined tonight by Congressman Mark Hamadeh. Come up, Mark. What a job you're doing. Mark is a warrior. Thank you, Mark. What a great job. What a great job. How we doing? Okay, we're doing all right here, right? Huh? Thank you very much. You're doing good. Thank you, Mark. Very much. We're also a man. There's ah, fighter. He's But if he loses. I will never talk to him again. And is the Nevada Republican Party chairman respected by everybody loved by everybody? Michael McDonald. Michael Michael.

I heard you leading in the polls, Jim. Get it done. We'll help you. A friend of mine and a man who is doing really well. And he's watching those, Uh, he's a very smart guy and respected by everybody. He's watching those ballots come in. I think he's watching every one of them. Attorney general, your former attorney general respected he They love him. And I love him. Adam Laxalt. Yeah. So, Adam, you and Nick finding any bad things, Anything bad happening? Can you please watch very closely at him for the people, Not for me. You know you're doing this for me. You're doing it for the people, okay? He's got the most important assignment There is because a lot of bad things. They're finding those things in creeks. They're finding them in riverbeds. They're finding them in ash cans and dumpsters and large numbers. In Ohio, 50,000 were missing. In Virginia, 500,000 applications were made that were false. And in one place, everything was good. Except for one problem. They forgot to put my name on it. Other than that, it was great. Other than that, it was great. Other than that, they were very reasonable. But my name wasn't on it. And then somehow that didn't work out too well, Michael. A lot of them to. And then they found some military ones. Great, great military ones. And they were found in a wastepaper basket. And they all had the name Trump on it. They were all signed for Trump. They were Trump. They were voted for TUnfortunately, I don't think they're gonna get there because they were the wastepaper basket. Anyway, on the Republican national committeeman from Nevada, Jim DeGraff une Jim. Thank you, Jim. Great job. Great job, Jim. How's it going? Good. We're doing all right over here, Jim. Good. You're handsome, man. Jim, as president, I've been delivering for our incredible Hispanic American community like never before. Thank you, darling. Thank you. I like you too. Thank you. You know, it's interesting that the polls are showing Trump. They're saying, What the hell is going on with Trump and the Hispanic American community? Right? No. Were the highest level that they've ever had recorded For a Republican. It's gotta be higher, but it's literally were beating the Democrats who have been all talking. No action. All talk. I like Hispanics, like Hispanics. I like Hispanics, Americans I want I'm taking care because I'm fighting for school choice right? Safe neighborhoods on Hispanic owned small businesses. You have no idea how great business people, Hispanic Americans, a great business people. I've known that for a long time. Sometimes I say they're too good. They are tough sometimes, but they're great business people, and we helped him. Joe Biden would crush everything. Hispanic Americans have worked for wiping out your small businesses with lockdowns and regulations and devastating your families with massive tax hikes. Your tax hikes your by the way. I never heard all my life. If you're running for office, you've got taxes, right? Who the hell ever heard of a guy running? Here's a guy can't put two sentences together, and he wants the quadruple your taxes, and they say he's tired and about How the hell can we be tied? How can I be tied with him in Pennsylvania? And he's and he doesn't wanna frack. That's a million jobs. And he's gonna destroy our energy business because we're energy independent. They're tied. I mean, what's going on? It's It doesn't And okay, so he goes out. There's no people at any of the rallies. I go out, we get 35 40,000, 25 1000. 15,000. No way. Go bum. 15,000. We get the biggest crowds in the history of politics. I mean, I'm not saying look, everything I say they're corrective, you know? I mean, they'll say, Who cares? I don't even care what they say but we get these massive crowds, he gets nobody. And then they say, we're tied. What the hell kind of a business of you and Michael? It doesn't make sense. How do you guys do this? He'll wage war on Catholic organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor, which we defend. Band charter schools, bankrupt Catholic schools. You know, we help the Catholic Church very much with our with our schools. We helped fund their schools fund extreme late term abortion and empower the Socialists. That's what they're doing. That's why we're going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote this November. So please write. I got our vote. Thank you, Don. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U. S. History and we're finishing the wall. The wall is gonna be very close to being finished their new dealers. This Well, I gotta tell you real fear. So their new deal is this. He didn't build much wall. You ever see this? They said I read of a You've got a pipe that's been laying in the sand for 30 years, A little pipe and they call that, and then we're building this 30 ft wall and I thought it would be all concrete, and I wish it was because it's cheaper. But the Border Patrol wanted it to be slats. They have to be able to see through it, which makes sense, E said. It's more expensive, so there's two things now. They said he didn't build a concrete wall. That's right. I built steel and inside the steel is concrete and inside the concrete is very powerful. Rebar and inside that we have wires. I would have much rather built a concrete plank wall. But you know what? I built what they wanted. I don't want it because they wouldn't be able to see through it. So if they can't see through it, no good. So here's the new deal. They got pipe laying down. They got some wooden fence. It's like 2 ft, anything that there's any if they ever had anything there, they call it a renovation. So now they say they did this vicious story that we only built a small number of months. You know, we're up to almost 400 miles, but we had to rip out. We had to rip out. We ripped out almost nothing, but basically they had some areas, like where they keep people from walking. They had some wooden little wooden stuff that was all rotted and no good. And you know, anything that had anything on it. So they call it a renovation. This is not. We ripped everything out. We went down 7 ft for tunneling and we went up 30 ft, and they say this is a renovation. They'll do anything to fake news to demean you anything. It's a disgrace. Anyway, we're up to almost 400. Where is Jared? Is he here? By the way? I'd love to introduce. He did such a great job on Middle East peace. You see what we're doing there? Middle East, Jared. He doesn't want any claim. He's just a very smart guy. You don't hire guys well, wherever he's back working on Middle East peace, probably, he said. I've heard this guy before. I don't have to here. But it's amazing what we've done in the Middle East, and we did the exact opposite, the way they've been doing it for 50 years, with blood all over the place. No blood in the sand. Joe Biden's party continues to attack or incredible border agents, more than half of whom are Hispanic American, by the way, and their extraordinary, these extraordinary Patriots deserve our admiration or gratitude and respect, right? They have, Oh, with yeah, Jared, How's the Middle East coming along place coming along? You know, we sign the United Arab Emirates Mohammed, one of the most respected warriors in the Middle East and Bahrain, and we have other countries lined up. Even The New York Times said. It's incredible. I can't believe it. I said, No way. I'm sure that person was fired. No. Was Tom Friedman. Then I'm gonna fire him. But they said it was incredible. But this guy has done a great job. And you know the nice thing he wants. No acclaim. He just wants to do what he wants. Todo and, you know, also worked on Israel, the capital, Jerusalem, Right? With our embassy. Great job. And he has no weight problem that I can tell you. You're so skinny. How do you stay so skinny? Jared Biden vowed to terminate our travel bands on jihadist regions and Serge refugee admissions by 700%. He wants to let him come in. And I want to pay our respects to President Macron of France because you saw what happened over there yesterday. What a horrible thing. Radical Islamic terrorism. Thank you. And I tell you, I saw a lot of I saw a lot of science. We're working on some things that you're gonna be. I saw a lot of signs, especially in California. You know, that way yourself, Armenians. All right. You know, they're good people. They're great business people. to, you know, for the Hispanic American, the Armenians, great business people. That's great. No, we're working where I just left. There were so many Armenians with a beautiful flag. Now we're working on. We're working on some things. I'm keeping terrorists. You have great spirit in your country. After people from Armenia, They have great spirit for their country. Thank you very much. But I'm keeping terrorists, extremists and criminals out of our country. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States military. We have the greatest equipment. We're the envy of the world. We have the greatest fighters, the greatest rockets and missiles. We have the greatest of everything. We passed VA Choice and VA accountability for a great vet. 91% approval rating. Way killed the leader of Isis al Baghdadi. They were looking for him for years. We wiped out 100% of the Isis Caliphate way, took out the caliphate and we killed the number one terrorist and mass murderer anywhere in the world. American troops, many troops, many people. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. My first call, if and when we win If and when we win and have to be, You know, we're going against the party if it went, but hopefully we do. My first goal will be from Iran. Their economy is a disaster. They're down GDP 27%. I've never even heard of that. They're down 27%. They're they're, It's a disaster. They will call and I don't want that to happen. I want them to have a great country, but they can't have nuclear weapons. It's very simple. They can't have nuclear weapons, and I think the first call we get will be from them and they'll sit down. I want to make a deal. Will make a good deal, you know? But what Kerry did, he's Oh, that's right. We're in Carson City, Africa. Who said that? Who is the one that's stand up? Let me see. That's pretty. That's pretty cool. I recognize the true Israel, as we say, and that was something that was really by the way. You know, when we did that and open the American Embassy in Jerusalem, I gotta built for a tiny fraction of the cost. I won't go into that story, but got it built. But when I did that, every president that ran for many, many, many of the presidents that ran many years, decades, decades and they all said they're going to do it. And then they got into office. They couldn't pull the trigger, right? They couldn't pull her. They couldn't pull it like somebody couldn't pull the trigger on that lettuce little putt to win the match. They couldn't pull the trigger and then other guys could pull the trigger and they think it. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years they've been trying to get it. I got it done in two hours, and I did. Maurin, 47 months, then sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. Girl, the Democrats are now pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a party or a presidential nominee. Biden doesn't understand it, so I won't bother with that. He still doesn't know what the hell's happening. The Biden plan would destroy Social Security and destroyed protections for pre existing conditions. Biden's running mate. You know they won't have socialized medicine, so you know, you forget about your 180 million plans that we have in this country that people absolutely love. They wanna have socialized medicine. You go to the hospital, you don't feel good. You went to the hospital for about three weeks. Biden's running mate sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance. They wanna wipe out 180 million plans. Biden and Harris will also shut down American Energy and obliterate your jobs with the socialist green. New Deal is I said, A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and a limitless future for all Americans. A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American dream. It's a vote for me. It's a vote with Yeah, yeah, Thank you. Thank you. On in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. Carson City. Get ready. But this whole state get ready and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It's already started. We will hire Mawr police. We love our police. Thank you to our police in our law enforcement and our great firemen and women. We love them way. Really? Dio, we have a lot of great support from the fireman and women. Increased penalties for assaults and law enforcement. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. The theme people don't even want the Sanctuary city. Only the politicians like way will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Second Amendment, we will save. You know, he put Beta in charge of taking your guns away. Bebeto. Remember birth. Remember when he was on the cover? That stupid Vanity Fair, which is I think it's dead. I think it died, but he was on the cover. And remember what he said he was doing okay. Not great. But they had him on the cover. They were trying to build him up. It didn't work out too well for him. Remember what he said? He said I was born to run for president. Once I said that, I said, he's gone. That's the end of their That's anybody said I was born to do this. Uh, he is a sick person. What a sick puppy that is. But he was put in charge by Biden to take your guns away. I don't think he's going to do too well in Carson City. Beta is coming to kick a gun. I don't want to start anything. I want you to obey the law because I have to. You know, they'll say he's he's going to start a rebellion. The fact is that Beto wants your guns taken away. Biden doesn't even know what the hell it means. And I'm gonna always protect your second. Remember, by the way your Second Amendment is under sees, nothing has happened, right? Nothing has happened on. There's been a lot of pressure on me on your Second Amendment. Nothing. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens, and we will keep out all of those. We will just stay out of all of those horrible, endless wars with places you've never heard 19 years in Afghanistan. I think that's enough. And we're acting as basically law enforcement were acting his police. Now they gotta do it themselves. We bring in our people back home. We will maintain America's unrivaled military right we have a military might like nobody's ever had before with our new everything, all made in the USA. And we will ensure peace through strength. We will end Surprise Medical building Require price. You know what price transparency is A better word. It's the biggest Adam knows. Michael knows it's the biggest thing there is. It's bigger than healthcare, in my opinion, and it's all done. It's signed price transparency. Watch further reduce the cost of prescription drugs. You know what I did? Favorite nations. Nobody can believe identity. You're gonna pay the lowest price of the world. And we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. America will land. The first woman in the moon on the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars Way will stop the radical indoctrination of our students on restore patriotic education to our studio. Look up there. We will teach our Children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. NFL way will live by the timeless words of our national motto. In God we trust. For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great state of Nevada. Uh huh. So get your friends, Get your family. Get your neighbors. Get your co workers. Get your boss. Tell your boss. Give me your boss. Got a vote. Got about, Boss. Come on, boss is grabbed him and just say, Come on, boss, Get out! And vote is the most important election we've ever had. Get out and vote. They call it the Red Wave. They're already saying they're not happy about what's happening. They know what's happening from Las Vegas. Torino from El Coto Henderson and from Carlin, too, right here in the wonderful, beautiful, hardworking Carson City. We stand on the shoulders of red blooded American patriots who poured out their hearts, sweat and soul to secure our liberty. And we just love our liberty, don't way. And, you know, liberty and freedom with bad leadership could be extinguished very quickly. You look at what happened in Venezuela and so many other places. We're just a much, much bigger version. And if we let them do this, you're not gonna have it for very long. It's a very sad thing most important election we've ever had. Nevada was founded by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk the face of the Earth. This state was built by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, innovators and Trailblazers who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, transformed a sprawling but beautiful desert into a shining oasis and lit up the brilliant lights of the Las Vegas Strip, which I know so well are American ancestors made this into the greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. It's happening. The best is yet Thio. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We're returning power to you, the American people. So with your help, your devotion in your drive, we're going to keep on working. We're going to keep on fighting on. We're going to keep on winning, winning, winning. You know, this is not acceptable way are one movement one people, one family on one glorious nation under God. Okay on together with the incredible people of Nevada, we have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again our stock market. New highs. Your 401 case. They're doing very well.

I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY FOR THE WORK YOU HAVE BEEN DOING. NOT JUST A LEADER HERE IN ASHEVILLE, BUT NORTH CAROLINA AND THE SUPPORT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO JOE BIDEN AND MYSELF. THE CHANCELLOR WHO IS HERE AND WHO GAVE ME SUCH A WONDERFUL AND WARM WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU DO IN NURTURING AND GROWING THE MINDS OF OUR INCREDIBLE FUTURE AND CURRENT LEADERS. TO THE MEMBERS OF THE NORTH CAROLINA GENERAL ASSEMBLY, I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. WE HAVE THE CHIEF OF THE EASTERN , CHEROKEE INDIANS. I WANT TO THANK HIM. I WANT TO THANK COUNTY COMMISSIONERS AND CITY COUNCILS, SHERIFF QUINTON MILLER AND ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU. SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT. I AM GOING TO MOVE THIS SO I CAN SEE YOU GUYS. 13 DAYS TO GO. 13 DAYS TO GO. WE CANNOT SPARE A MINUTE, SISTERS AND BROTHERS. WE CANNOT SPARE A MINUTE IN TERMS OF EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW EVERYONE HERE, AND AROUND OUR COUNTRY IS PREPARED TO DO. AS JOE BIDEN SAYS, FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. THAT IS REALLY WHAT IS GOING ON. IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. IT IS ABOUT KNOWING WE DESERVE MORE AND WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT HAPPENED EVEN BEFORE COVID STRUCK. IN MANY WAYS, I THOUGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC OF BEING AN ACCELERATOR. IT HAS HIGHLIGHTED WHAT WAS WRONG BEFORE AND HAS MADE IT WORSE. LET'S THINK ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH, ESPECIALLY DURING THIS VIRUS. WE CAN'T OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT ON JANUARY 28, DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE WERE INFORMED OF THE NATURE OF COVID-19. THEY WERE INFORMED. FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO KILL PEOPLE THAN THE FLU. THEY WERE INFORMED IT COULD HARM CHILDREN. INFORMED IT IS AIRBORNE. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THE FAMILIES OF ASHEVILLE, THE FAMILIES OF NORTH CAROLINA COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT INFORMATION ON THAT DATE? TO PREPARE? B IT TO STOCK UP ON TOILET PAPER, OR TO PLAN BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DO NOT HAVE MORE THAN $1000 IN SAVINGS? WHAT FOLKS MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE KNOWING THAT IT IS PREDICTABLE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO WORK FOR A WHILE. SADLY, WE STILL HAVE SO MANY WORKERS WHO DO NOT HAVE SICK LEAVE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE. HE DID NOT TELL US. THEY SAT ON THAT INFORMATION. THEY COVERED IT UP. INSTEAD, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES STUCK , WHOSE FIRST RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD BE TO KEEP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFE SAT ON THIS INFORMATION AND SUGGESTED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU DON'T WEAR A MASK, AND ON THE OTHER SIDE IF YOU DO. NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE OVER 220,000 AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. MANY OF WHOM HAVE FAMILIES, AND THEY COULD NOT SEE THEM, HOLD THEIR HANDS, TOUCH THEM IN THEIR LAST DAYS ON THIS EARTH. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE OVER 8 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CONTRACTED THIS VIRUS. HAVING UNTOLD LONG-TERM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING WHAT DOCTORS ARE TELLING US HIS LUNG SCARRING AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. IN THE MIDST OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, YOU'VE GOT DONALD TRUMP AND BILL BARR , IT IS STRANGER THAN FICTION. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT EXPRESSION? WE ARE LIVING IT. WE ARE LIVING IT, SISTER. WHAT ARE WE SEEING RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC? DONALD TRUMP AND BILL BARR ARE IN THE SUPREME COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN MADE HAPPEN. THAT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS. IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL, IT IS ESTIMATED AT LEAST 23 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE THEIR COVERAGE. THERE IS THIS WEIRD THING , A COUPLE , BUT THE THING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, HE HAS GOT THIS WEIRD OBSESSION WITH WANTING TO GET RID OF WHATEVER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN CREATED. IT IS THIS WEIRD OBSESSION, RIGHT? IF HE IS SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, REMEMBER, IT LAID IN PLACE PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IF YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO HAS DIABETES, ASTHMA, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, BREAST CANCER, NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 8 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION CALLED COVID AND THEY ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF IT. THAT ALONE IS REASON ENOUGH THAT HE IS INCAPABLE OF BEING A PRESIDENT WHO WILL PROTECT THE WELL-BEING AND HEALTH OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY HE HAS GOT TO GO. WE ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION, THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN AN ACCELERATOR. OVER 30 MILLION AMERICANS HAD TO APPLY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. MANY OF WHOM DID NOT HAVE PAID SICK LEAVE, DID NOT HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. THEY ARE TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE IN, WHAT I CALL, AN ILLEGITIMATE PROCESS , BY THE WAY, WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT ELECTION SEASON, WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT ELECTION YEAR, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN ELECTION THAT IS TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW WHERE OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE VOTED AND THE ELECTION WILL BE OVER IN 13 DAYS, AND THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DECIDE WHO WILL BE THERE PRESIDENT. AND THAT IS THE PERSON WHO SHOULD DECIDE WHO WILL FILL A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN OUR LAND. YET, THEY ARE TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH THIS NOMINATION. I SERVED ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. I WILL SAY PUBLICLY, I WILL OPPOSE HER CONFIRMATION. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. IT INCLUDES THE ILLEGITIMACY OF THE PROCESS, THE RIGHT OF WOMEN TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES AND THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE. THAT INCLUDES THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THEY ARE PUSHING THIS THING THROUGH. THERE IS A BILL SITTING ON THE DESK THAT HAS BEEN SITTING THERE FOR 150 DAYS CALLED THE HEROES ACT THAT WOULD BRING RELIEF TO ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING. IN FOOD LINES FOR HOURS. THE ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS IN AMERICA WHO IS DESCRIBING HER CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12 AS BEING HUNGRY, WHO NEED AN EXPANSION OF WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR. SNAP BENEFITS. WE USED TO CALL IT FOOD STAMPS. IT IS WHAT PEOPLE NEED WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY. THEY ARE PUSHING THROUGH THIS NOMINATION INSTEAD OF SENATE REPUBLICANS SAYING A VOTE ON THAT BILL. INCLUDING ONE SENATOR FROM THIS STATE. YOU KNOW WHO I AM TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING AND THIS IS WHY WE NEED JOE BIDEN TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT. ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN, WHO WAS ONE OF THE CREATORS AND REASONS WE HAVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHO WILL MAKE A COMMITMENT , HAS MADE A COMMITMENT TO YOU, NORTH CAROLINA AND THE PUBLIC, THAT HE WILL EXPAND COVERAGE. SHE WILL EXPAND HEALTH. BRING DOWN THE COST OF PREMIUMS. BRING DOWN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. HE IS SAYING HE WILL EXPAND HEALTH CARE, UNDERSTANDING FOR TOO LONG WE ARE PRETENDING HEALTH CARE IS ABOUT A BODY THAT STARTS FROM THE NECK DOWN, THE BODY STARTS FROM THE NECK UP, THAT IS METAL HEALTH CARE. ON THE OTHER HAND, DONALD TRUMP IS SUING TO GET RID OF IT. WE HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS, WE MEASURE THE SUCCESS OF THE ECONOMY BASED ON THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF WORKING FAMILIES IN AMERICA. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO PASSED A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% IN THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA, WHICH WILL LEAD TO A $2 TRILLION DEFICIT. JOE BIDEN SAYS I AM NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON ANYONE WHO MAKES LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. HE SAYS I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE FIRST HOME BUYERS GET A TAX CREDIT TO HELP THEM WITH DOWN PAYMENTS AND CLOSING COSTS, KNOWING HOMEOWNERSHIP IS ONE OF THE GREATEST WAYS TO CREATE WEALTH AND AMERICAN FAMILIES. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS WE HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH SUPPORTING THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF AMERICA AND WE WILL TRIPLE TITLE I FUNDING FOR THOSE SCHOOLS THAT ARE IN THE HIGHEST NEED COMMUNITIES WITH THE LOWEST TAX BASE BECAUSE THE CHILDREN OF THOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE A GOD-GIVEN CAPACITY TO BE NURTURED AND THRIVE, BUT WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES. ON THE OTHER HAND, DONALD TRUMP WHO PUT BETSY DEVOS IN OFFICE. ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO HAS BEEN REJECTING SCIENCE FROM DAY ONE. REJECTING SCIENCE ON THIS CLIMATE CRISIS WHICH IS THREATENING OUR EXISTENCE. REJECTING SCIENCE ON THIS VIRUS. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO EMBRACES SCIENCE WHO WILL BE A LEADER WHO SAYS THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS MUST GUIDE THE POLICY DECISIONS WE MAKE ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT LITERALLY THREATEN THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THERE ARE VERY CLEAR CHOICES HERE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS I DO BELIEVE THE OUTCOME OF THIS RACE WILL, IN MANY WAYS, BE DECIDED BY YOU. NORTH CAROLINA. IT WILL BE. IN THAT WAY, THE CHOICES AND DECISIONS YOU ARE MAKING WILL IMPACT PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY. IN THAT WAY, WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO VOTE, AND VOTE EARLY, IS GOING TO IMPACT PEOPLE YOU MAY NEVER MEET AND PEOPLE WHO MAY NEVER KNOW YOUR NAME, BUT WHOSE LIVES WILL FOREVER BE CHANGED BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING. I AM HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA 13 DAYS BEFORE THIS ELECTION TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ALL HAVE ALREADY DONE AND WHAT YOU ARE COMMITTED TO DO. THIS ISSUE BEFORE US OF WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH FIXING THE PROBLEMS, BUT IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH RESTORING , IN OUR COUNTRY, WHAT WE KNOW TO BE OUR HIGHEST IDEALS. UNITY, BRINGING FOLKS TOGETHER, REJECTING THESE NOTIONS OF FEAR, HATE AND DIVISION. DOING WHAT WE KNOW WE HAVE HAD THE CAPACITY AND HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO TO REGAIN OUR STANDING IN A WAY WE CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR NATION. ALL OF THIS IS AT STAKE RIGHT NOW. JOE AND I ARE PARTICULARLY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT OURS IS A CAMPAIGN THAT HAS PROBABLY BUILT ONE OF THE BROADEST COALITIONS OF ANY CAMPAIGN IN RECENT HISTORY. WE HAVE GOT THE SUPPORT OF DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND ALL RACES. WHY? BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT TO STRENGTHEN OUR NATION, TO TAKE BACK THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US AND ALL OF US BEING A PART OF WHERE WE GO AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO. I WANT TO THANK YOU, ASHEVILLE FOR ALL THAT YOU ARE DOING. 13 DAYS TO GO. WE DON'T WANT TO LOOK BACK AND HAVE ANY REGRETS. MY LAST POINT IS THIS, THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS ARE GOING TO LOOK AT US, THEY ARE GOING TO LOOK IN OUR EYES AND ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT? HERE IS THE THING, WHAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM IS MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT IN THIS PARKING LOT IN ASHEVILLE WITH THE MAYOR AND ALL OF THESE INCREDIBLE FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND WE WILL TELL THEM HOW WE ORGANIZED, WE MADE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IS HAD STEAK, HOW WE REMINDED PEOPLE WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER, AND WE WILL TELL THEM ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. THANK YOU ALL.",

         "THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY. HELLO DES MOINES. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE IN DES MOINES. THEY SAID SIR IT IS SO WINDY OUT THERE. I SAID WELL, MY HAIR IS VERY POWERFUL, IT IS VERY STRONG. IT CAN HANDLE IT. GIMMICK THEY SAID IT COULD GET BAD IT'S VERY WINDY. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. I'M THRILLED TO BE BACK IN THE AMERICAN HEARTLAND WITH THOUSANDS OF LOYAL, HARD-WORKING AMERICAN PATRIOTS. AND 20 DAYS FROM NOW WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS STATE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND I MUST TELL YOU. LOOK THE POLL JUST CAME OUT, WE ARE UP SIX. BIG DEAL. DIDN'T WE WIN BY 11 OR SOMETHING SOMETHING? IF I'M UP SIX, NOBODY HAS EVER DONE FOR IOWA AND THE FARM BELT AND THE FARMERS AND ALL, NO MORE ESTATE TAXES. NO MORE ANYTHING, I SAVED ETHANOL. ETHANOL IS SAVED. FOR ME TO IT ONLY BE UP SIX I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED I WILL TELL YOU THAT. BECAUSE NOBODY'S GOING TO DO FOR IOWA WHAT I DID FOR IOWA. WE JUST LEARN THROUGH EXPLOSIVE DOCUMENTS PUBLISHED BY A VERY FINE NEWSPAPER, THE 'NEW YORK POST' THAT JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN BLATANTLY LYING ABOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT IN HIS SON'S CORRUPTED BUSINESS DEALINGS. THIS IS A BIG SMOKING GUN. THE NEWLY UNCOVERED E-MAILS REVEALED A TOP EXECUTIVE FROM THE HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE UKRAINIAN COMPANY, IT IS AN ENERGY COMPANY WHICH PAID HUNTER AT LEAST $50000 A MONTH. A SNOUT LOOKING LIKE IT COULD BE $183,000 A MONTH. THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY. WOULD ANYBODY IN THIS AUDIENCE TAKE IT? I WOULD TAKE IT. WE WILL TAKE IT. DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE'S ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE, KNEW NOTHING ABOUT ENERGY. WROTE TO HUNTER, ARRANGING FOR A MEETING TO MEET WITH VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR A LONG TIME WITH HIS FAMILY PRAYED THE SAME UKRAINIAN ENERGY EXECUTIVES SENT HUNTER AN E-MAIL SAYING QUOTE WE URGENTLY NEED YOUR ADVICE ON HOW YOU COULD USE YOUR INFLUENCE. IN OTHER WORDS HUNTER WAS BEING PAID FOR ACCESS TO HIS VICE PRESIDENT FATHER, WHO WAS SPECIFICALLY PUT IN CHARGE OF UKRAINE AND RUSSIA. HOW ABOUT THE RUSSIA HOAX? IT TURNS OUT THEY WERE THE ONE THAT DID THE RUSSIA HOAX. IT WAS THEM. NO COLLUSION, NO COLLUSION. THESE E-MAILS SHOWED THAT BIDEN'S REPEATED CLAIM THAT HE HAS NEVER SPOKEN TO HUNTER ABOUT HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS WERE A COMPLETE LIE. IT WAS A TOTAL LIE. TRY TO COVER UP A MASSIVE PAY FOR PLAY SCANDAL AT THE HEART OF HIS VICE PRESIDENT SEPARATE EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON KNOWS IT. WE HAVE KNOWN IT FOR A LONG TIME TIME. THE FACT IS THERE'S NEVER, NEVER AN ADMINISTRATION MORE CORRUPT THAN THE OBAMA/BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. THERE IS NEVER, NEVER. JUST WEEKS AGO JOE STOOD BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AT A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AND TOLD YOU THAT THESE CLAIMS HAD BEEN TOTALLY DISCREDITED. AND THAT HIS SON DID NOTHING WRONG. BUT NOW THAT TURNS OUT TO BE A TOTAL LIE. NOW WE CAN SEE CLEARLY THAT BIDEN IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN WHO SHOULD NOT EVEN BE ALLOWED TO RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY. I WAS PRESSING JOE BIDEN TO TELL THE TRUTH BECAUSE THE CORRUPT MEDIA, ALL THOSE CAMERAS BACK THERE. THEY ARE CORRUPT. AND THEY REFUSED TO WRITE THE STORY. THERE'S NOT ONE TIME IN ALMOST FOUR YEARS DURING MY PRESIDENCY, DURING THE GREATEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN U.S. HISTORY, EIGHT WITCHHUNTS A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE DISGUSTING WITCHHUNT THAT SHOULD NEVER EVER HAPPENED TO ANOTHER PRESIDENCY AGAIN. AND PEOPLE SHOULD PAY FOR THE CRIMES THEY COMMITTED. TURNED OUT TO BE A TOTAL ILLEGAL HOAX THAT FALSE AND LIBELOUS STORIES EVERY DAY, FALSE AND LIBELOUS STORIES. AND THEY KNEW THEY WERE FALSE TOO. THEY KNEW THEY WERE FALSE. THEY WERE NEVER TAKEN DOWN BY TWITTER OR FACEBOOK, OR THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, NEVER ONCE. YET, WITH BIDEN TODAY THEY TAKE A NEGATIVE POSTED DOWN ALMOST BEFORE THEY EVEN GO UP. THEY ARE TRYING TO PROTECT HIM. THEY ARE TRYING TO PROTECT THE BIDEN. THEY TAKE THEM DOWN FOR IT I WAS JUST GETTING OFF THAT MAGNIFICENT PLANE BEHIND US, AIR FORCE ONE,. AND I HAD HEARD AND I JUST DON'T KNOW THIS FOR A FACT, BUT THEY SAY KAYLEE MCELNEA, YOU KNOW KAYLEE. GOOD KAYLEE SHE IS SO GREAT. SHE IS INCREDIBLE THEY CLOSE DOWN HER ACCOUNT. SHE IS THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY BECAUSE SHE IS REPORTING THE TRUTH. THEY CLOSE DOWN HER ACCOUNT. SO LET'S SEE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. AND DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS, BRUCE ORR IS FINALLY OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. HE AND HIS WONDERFUL WIFE MOLLY SHE WROTE ALL OF THIS STUFF AND HE GOES AND WORKS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND HE TOOK IT DIDN'T BRING IT TO THE FBI? THE WIFE GETS PAID A LOT OF MONEY. RESOURCE FINALLY OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THAT IS GOOD. A COUPLE OF YEARS TOO LATE THAT'S ALL HE SHOULD BE NOT ONLY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OUTBOX HE SHOULD BE SOMEPLACE ELSE, OKAY? EIGHT MONTHS AFTER HIS ALLEGED MEETING WITH THE EXECUTIVES, OF FOR ME SHE THEY PRONOUNCE IT FOR MISHA, A REAL BEAUTIFUL COMPANY. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WENT TO UKRAINE AND THREATEN TO WITHHOLD $1 BILLION IN AID THEY DID NOT FIRE THE PROSECUTOR THAT WAS INVESTIGATING HIS SON AS THE COMPANY THAT HIS SON WORKED FOR. THE DOCUMENTS ALSO SHOWED THAT BEFORE ONE OF JOE'S TRIPS TO UKRAINE, HUNTER E-MAILED HIS BUSINESS PARTNER SAYING HIS LUCRATIVE CONTRACT SHOULD BEGIN NOW. TAKE OF THAT, SHOULD BEGIN NOW. RIGHT NOW SCOTT TO BEGIN. THE WHOLE THING IS SO INCREDIBLE. HERE'S A GUY, LET'S PUT IT IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE PRETTY GOT THROWN OUT OF THE MILITARY. THAT IS UNFORTUNATE. HE DID NOT HAVE A JOB FOR A LONG TIME. HIS FATHER BECOMES VICE PRESIDENT. AND HE IS MAKING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. THINK OF IT. THINK OF IT. IT'S LIKE THAT KIRK AND IT'S THE CROOKED JOE. YOU KNOW WHEN A DEMOCRAT VOTER HERE IN IOWA ASKED A JOKE LAST, YOU REMEMBER THE SUN RAKED IN MUDDY AND EXCHANGE PROVIDING ACCESS, JOB CALLED BATMAN A DAMN LIAR. YOU ARE A DAMN LIAR. HIS KID IS MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HE HAD NOTHING. HE DID NOT HAVE A JOB, THROWN OUT OF THE MILITARY, SADLY BUT THROWN OUT OF THE MILITARY. AND HEAR NOTHING ABOUT ENERGY. HEATER NOTHING ABOUT INVESTMENTS INVESTMENTS. HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT CHINA. HOW BUDDY WALKED AWAY A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS TO MANAGE FOR CHINA? THEY DON'T DO THAT WITH THE MOST BRILLIANT PEOPLE ON WALL STREET. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, YOU OWE THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA AN APOLOGY BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT, YOU ARE A CORRUPT POLITICIAN. OKAY? JOE BIDEN MUST IMMEDIATELY RELEASE ALL E-MAILS, MEETINGS, PHONE CALLS, TRANSCRIPTION RECORDS RELATED TO HIS INVOLVEMENT AND HIS FAMILY'S BUSINESS DEALINGS, INFLUENCE AROUND THE WORLD. INCLUDING CHINA AND INCLUDING RUSSIA. INCLUDING RUSSIA. HUNTER RAKES IN A FORTUNE FROM CHINA WHILE JOE BIDEN WAS GIVING CHINA ALL OF OUR JOBS, YOU KNOW WHERE THEY CAME FROM, IOWA. AND PLENTY OF OTHER PLACES. BUT THEY CAME FROM IOWA. HE WAS GIVING THEM, THEY WERE TAKING OUR JOBS. THEY WERE TAKING OUR FACTORIES, THEY WERE TAKING EVERYTHING THEY'RE TAKING OUR WEALTH. AND I GAVE YOU $28 BILLION AND SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH PRESIDENT XI IT CAME RIGHT OUT OF CHINA PAIRED BECAUSE OF THAT EVERYBODY IS HAPPY IN IOWA. JUST HOPE YOU REMEMBER THAT ON NOVEMBER 3. I HOPE YOU REMEMBER, NOBODY ELSE WOULD'VE DONE THAT. NOBODY ELSE WOULD'VE DONE IT. THE BIDEN FAMILY TREATED THE VICE PRESIDENCY AS A FOR-PROFIT CORPORATION FLYING AROUND THE GLOBE, COLLECTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM CHINA AND UKRAINE AND RUSSIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. IN FACT, THE WIFE OF THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW GAVE HUNTER BIDEN A CHECK FOR $3.5 MILLION IN CASH WHILE HIS FATHER GAVE AWAY THE STORE TO RUSSIA. INCLUDING CRIMEA. REMEMBER CRIMEA THE BIDEN'S GOT RICH WHILE AMERICA GOT ROBBED. BY CONTRAST, THIS IS SO TRUE IN IT SO EASILY TRUE AND I'M SO PROUD OF IT IN SO MANY WAYS. I'D GIVEN UP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO SERVE AS YOUR PRESIDENT. AND IT IS MY GREATEST HONOR OF A LIFETIME. SO TRUE. FORMER YEARS SPURRED FOUR MORE YEARS. FOR MORE YEARS. SO BACK IRAN FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I CANNOT SIT BACK ANY LONGER WATCH THE TERRIBLE INJUSTICES BEING DONE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND IT IS TRUE. AND BY THE WAY, FOR THE CHINA PLAGUE CAME IN, WE HAD THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. NOW IT IS GOING RIGHT BACK THERE. OUR STOCK MARKET IS VERY CLOSE TO A NUMBER THAT WAS EVEN HIGHER. THIS EVERYONE HAVE YOUR 401 READY? IT'S GOING THROUGH THE ROOF. WHEN HAVE THE BEST YEAR WE HAVE EVER HAD. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TAX CUTS NOT TAX INCREASES. THEY WOULD TO INCREASE YOUR TAXES. THEY WANT TO INCREASE YOUR TAXES SO THEY CAN SPEND IT ON THE GREEN NEW DEAL. YOU KNOW THAT DON'T YOU? I DID NOT SIT IDLY BY AND WATCH CAREER POLITICIANS LIKE JOE BIDEN CONTINUE BLEEDING THIS COUNTRY DRY. THAT IS WHAT IT IS. YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT. YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A KID THAT FOLLOWS HIS FATHER PRAYED TO GO IT LOOK UP LOOK AT HIS BROTHER PRINTED BROTHER IS BUILDING A BIG HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN IRAQ. HAVE YOU EVER BUILT A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT BEFORE? NO I HAVE IT. TAKE A LOOK AT THE WHOLE FAMILY IT'S A CORRUPT FAMILY. JOE BIDEN PERSONIFIES THE CORRUPT GLOBALIST GOT RICH AND POWERFUL AT YOUR EXPENSE. TAKE A LOOK AT THE PEOPLE FUNDING HIS CAMPAIGN. PEOPLE ASSUME THEY WILL BE FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. I DON'T WANT THEM. WE DON'T WANT THEM. WE NEVER NEEDED THEM, WE DON'T WANT THEM. BUT THEY BETRAYED AMERICAN WORKERS, DISPARAGE AMERICAN VALUES AND CRUSHED OUR MIDDLE CLASS. FOR DECADES, BIDEN'S AND HIS CRONIES LEFT WITH A SHIP TO MILLIONS OF YOUR JOBS TO THEIR FRIENDS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES BRITAIN COUNTRIES THAT YOU'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. THEY LIVE BEHIND GATED WALLS AND THEY FLOODED YOUR COMMUNITIES WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. DEADLY DRUGS, MS 13 SAVAGES THAT RAPE AND MURDER INNOCENT AMERICANS. THEY FORCED OUR FELLOW CITIZENS TO LIVE IN CRUMBLING INTER- CITIES THEY SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON A NEVER ENDING FOREIGN WARS. THEY JUST NEVER ENDED. BUT YOU KNOW, WE ARE BRINGING ALL OF HER SOLDIERS BACK HOME. YOU KNOW THAT. AND IT IS NOT EASY. NOT EASY. THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX IT IS NOT THE EASIEST THING BUT WE ARE BRINGING THEM BACK HOME. WERE ALMOST FINISHED IN AFGHANISTAN. WE ARE DEALING, WE ARE DOWN TO A SMALL NUMBER COMING HOME BY THE END OF THE YEAR. HOPEFULLY THE END OF THE YEAR OR SHORTLY THEREAFTER. IN SYRIA WE ARE TOTALLY OUT. BY THE WAY WE CRUSHED ONE 100% OF THE ISIS. ONE 100%. WE CRUSHED ONE 100% FOR THE GREATEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD AND BY THE WAY WE HAVE BUILT THE GREATEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD. SO I JUST TELL YOU FROM IOWA, YOU ARE A VERY POWERFUL STATE POLITICALLY. YOU ARE A BIG STATE TO ME. BIG IN YOUR HEARTS. YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE IN A TREMENDOUS POWER. YOU HAVE NEVER LET ME DOWN. YOU JUST CAME IN AND WE WON BY SO MUCH. THEY SAY A REPUBLICAN WINS BY ONE POINT I THINK I WON BY 11, RIGHT? ELEVEN. THAT WAS EARLY IN THE NIGHT, REMEMBER THAT? THEY SAID DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE STATE OF IOWA. AND THEY SAID MAN HE WON BY 11 POINTS, WHAT'S GOING ON? THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING. AND WE WENT OHIO. WE WENT OHIO BY EIGHT POINTS. THEY SAID WHAT'S GOING ON? IT'S ONE THING WE KNEW WHEN A STATE BUT YOU WIN BY A LOT THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, WE HAVE MORE ENTHUSIASM NOW THAN WE EVER DID FOUR YEARS AGO. WE HAVE GREAT POLL NUMBERS PART OF THE UC A LOT A FAKE POLL NUMBERS THEY WILL DO ANYTHING THEY CAN THEY ARE CALLED SUPPRESSION POLES. GATHER THEY GO. LOOK LOOK AT THE RED LIGHT START TO GO OFF. ONE WAY THEY WANT THE RATINGS IN OTHER THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE RATINGS WHEN YOU'RE TELLING CNN THEY ARE A FRAUD AS THEY ARE BROADCASTING. THAT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST IS ONE OF THE GREATEST EVENINGS EVER. THERE ARE THOSE THAT SAY IT WAS THE MOST EXCITING EVENING IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION. HIGHEST RATED EVENING AND THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION FOR IT YOU KNOW WHAT? THE ELECTION WE HAVE COMING UP ON NOVEMBER 3 IS ACTUALLY MORE IMPORTANT. ACTUALLY MORE IMPORTANT. IN 2016 DEVOTED TO FIRE THE FAILED AND DECREPIT POLITICAL CLASS. AND YOU ELECTED AN OUTSIDER AS YOUR PRESIDENT. AND I FINALLY PUT AMERICA FIRST. IT'S CALLED MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. IT'S WINDY OUT HERE. IF YOU CAN WEAR THE HAT I CAN WEAR THE HAT. SHOULD I TAKE OFF THE TIRE NOT? WHAT YOU THINK? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE YES? OH THAT FEELS SO MUCH BETTER. THAT FEELS BETTER, THAT FEELS GOOD. NOW WE CAN ALL RELAX AND HAVE A GOOD TIME. IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. SERIOUSLY WE HAVE HAD A GREAT HISTORY HERE TOGETHER. WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR YOU AND WHAT WE'VE DONE FOR THE FARMERS AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR EVERYTHING. YOU KNOW TWO WEEKS AGO YOU HAD THE LARGEST ORDER OF CORN AND HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, RIGHT? TWO WEEKS AGO YOU HAD THE LARGEST ORDER OF SOYBEANS AND HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND THE LARGEST ORDER ORDER OF BEEF. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE CHINA WANTS TO KEEP ME HAPPY. THAT IS WHY. IT WAS FROM CHINA BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED. THEY COULD HAVE STOPPED IT. THEY DID NOT STOP IT. THEY SHOULD'VE STOPPED IT. THE ONLY REASON I'M YOUR PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION DID A POOR JOB. SO POURED BACK BUT HE SAID I'M GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IF THEY DID A GOOD JOB I WOULD NOT HAVE RUN. IF THEY DID A GOOD JOB I GUESS I WOULD NOT HAVE ONE, WHAT YOU THINK? I WOULD NOT HAVE RUN AND I WOULD NOT HAVE ONE. THEY ARE SO BAD AND THEY'RE SO TOTALLY CORRUPT WE DID NOT COME THIS FAR TO OVERCOME THIS MUCH AND FIGHT THIS HARD. ONLY TO SURRENDER OUR COUNTRY BACK TO THE DEPRAVED WASHINGTON. YOU KNOW WHEN I WOULD SAY, IS TO SAY DRAIN THE SWAMP AND PEOPLE LIKE TO PRINT A HATED THE EXPRESSION I HATED IT. I HATED I SAID THIS IS A HOKEY EXPRESSION AND I PUT IT IN ONE AND THE PLACE WENT CRAZY. I PUT AN ANOTHER SPEECH AND THEY WENT CRAZY BUT I SAID YOU KNOW I REALLY LIKE IT. I REALLY LIKE IT. WHEN I SAY DRAIN THE SWAMP I HAD NO IDEA THIS SWAMP WAS NOT DIRTY THAT DISCUSSING AND THAT DEEP. IT'S TRUE. I DON'T SOUND LIKE A TYPICAL WASHINGTON I DON'T CONSULT GREAT POLITICIANS WE HAVE GREAT ONES WITH US TONIGHT. I DON'T ALWAYS PLAY BY THE RULES OF WASHINGTON AND WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT IT IS BECAUSE I WAS ELECTED TO FIGHT FOR YOU, HARDER THAN EVER. I TELL YOU WHAT, I FIGHT FOR YOU HARDER THAN ANY PRESIDENT HAS EVER FOUGHT FOR ANYONE. IT'S NOT EASY. BUT I LOVE IT. WE ARE MAKING TREMENDOUS PROGRESS. WE ARE MAKING TREMENDOUS PROGRESS. THE FACT IS NO ADMINISTRATION IN THE FIRST THREE AND A HALF YEARS HAS EVER DONE AS MUCH AS THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE. YOU TAKE A LOOK. RIGHT NOW I AM FIGHTING TO ERADICATE THE VIRUS, REBUILD THE ECONOMY AND SAVE OUR COUNTRY FROM THE RADICAL LEFT. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE DOUG. AS A CANDIDATE, JOE BIDEN IS MADE YET ANOTHER CORRUPT EXCHANGE FOR HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION. HE HAS HANDED CONTROL TO THE SOCIALISTS AND MARXISTS. AND THE LUNATIC LEFT WING FRINGE THAT ARE REALLY RUNNING THAT PARTY. HE IS NOT RUNNING IT. LET'S FACE IT, JOE IS SHOT. WHERE YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. WE CAN ALL BE NICE, IT'S GOING TO BE MY TURN SOMEDAY. IT'S EVEN GOING TO BE YOUR TURN SOMEDAY TO MY FRIENDS. SOMEDAY. BUT WHEN IT IS YOUR TURN YOU CANNOT BE PRESIDENT. ONE THING I LEARNED PRESIDENT SHE OF CHINA'S ONE HUNTER PERCENT. PUTIN OF RUSSIA IS ONE 100%. KIM JOHN OWN, BY THE WAY WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT WAR ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN? THESE PEOPLE ARE SHARP AS THEY ARE SMART. JOE HAS LOST IT. HE'S NOT A SMART MAN EVERYONE KNOWS IT. JOE IS GONE IF HE RINGS THE RADICAL LEFT THEY WILL BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY FOR THEY ARE ADDICTED TO POWER. AND GOD HELP US IF THEY GET IT. WE'LL NEVER BE THE SAME COUNTRY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO RECOVER. AND WE ARE THE COUNTRY WAS COMING TOGETHER. I WAS TELLING A VERY, VERY GOOD REPORTER TODAY THAT OUR COUNTRY WAS COMING TOGETHER BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING SUCH SUCCESS. I WAS BEING CALLED BY PEOPLE THAT NORMALLY I WOULD NOT BE SPEAKING TO, TOO MUCH. THEY DON'T WANT ME I DON'T WANT THEM. BUT WITH THE BEST EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS AND HISTORY. AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC AMERICAN WOMEN ASIAN, EVERYTHING. HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WITHOUT HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. COLLEGES, WITH THE BEST NUMBERS IN EVERY CATEGORY. 160MILLION JOBS, WE WERE NEVER CLOSE TO THAT. 160MILLION JOBS. AND IT WAS ALL COMING TOGETHER. LET'S GET TOGETHER LET'S TALK. IT IS LIKE SPLITTING UP THE RICHES. AND IN A POSITIVE WAY. SPLITTING UP THE RICHES RATE WHAT HAPPENED HAS GOT HIT WITH THE PLAGUE. NOW IT'S BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A STRONG THIRD-QUARTER'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE. WE SEE THE NUMBERS, NOT THAT I KNOW ANYTHING BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO GIVE YOU INSIGHT INFORMATION BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE IT. THE GOING TO SAY HE IS GIVING AWAY INSIGHT INFORMATION. THEY ARE SICK. BUT WAIT TO SEE THE THIRD-QUARTER NUMBERS. IT'S GOING TO BE RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION. BEFORE NOVEMBER 3 PRINT ALTHOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL HAVE VOTED BY THAT TIME. GET OUT AND VOTES. YOU GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE. WE WERE REALLY COMING TOGETHER. EVERYONE COME TOGETHER PRINT I WERE REALLY COMING TOGETHER THE BIT HIT BY THIS HORRIBLE SITUATION. COULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED. CHINA STOPPED IT FROM GOING INTO THE REST OF CHINA. BUT THEY DID NOT STOP IT FROM COMING OUT AND GOING TO EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. 188 COUNTRIES. SO WE ARE NOW PUTTING IT TOGETHER. WE HAD IT DONE AND NOW WE ARE DOUG IT AGAIN. AND NEXT YEAR WE WILL BE EVEN STRONGER THAN LAST YEAR. LESTER WAS THE ESTHER WE'VE EVER HAD. AND THIS COMING YEAR WILL BE EVEN BETTER THAN LAST YEAR. UNLESS SOMEBODY COMES ALONG AND SAYS LET'S QUADRUPLE YOUR TAXES WHICH IS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. WHICH BY THE WAY THEIR ORIGINAL PRICE 100 TRILLION YOU CANNOT DO IT FOR THAT. IF WE DID GREAT EVERY YEAR FOR 100 YEARS. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT, RIGHT? NO NOTHING NO RECESSIONS NO ANYTHING. YOU COULD NOT MAKE $100 TRILLION. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. AND THEY ACTUALLY MEAN IT. THEY ACTUALLY MEAN IT. SO WE ARE GOING TO GET IT GOING TO A LEVEL I TELL THE STORY FOR YEARS BUT THE ECONOMIES I LOVE WATCHING IT I LOVE DOUG IT. AND I LOVE SEEING THE RESULTS BECAUSE THE RESULTS ARE SO INCREDIBLE. IT AS A STUDENT I USED HERE FOR YEARS, TEN YEARS, 2019 CHINA. 1.4BILLION PEOPLE. NOT INCLUDING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THAT ARE IN THE COUNTRY. I SAID HOW MANY DO WE HAVE? THEY SAID WE HAVE NO IDEA SURVEYED I HAVE AN IDEA. BY THEIR SOUTHERN BORDER IS NOW STRONGER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN. WEIRD 3925, THREE AND 30 MILLION PEOPLE. BUT FOR YEARS CHINA WILL TO OVERTAKE US AS A LARGEST ECONOMY AND THE YEAR 2019 I THINK YOU'VE ALL HEARD IT I THINK YES? THERE'S A VERY SMART LOOKING GUY, YOU ARE LOADED WITH MONEY I BET. THAT'S WHY HE IS IN THE FRONT ROW. HE'S IN THE FRONT ROW WHEN HE DID NOT HAVE TO STAND HERE FOR THREE DAYS TO GET HERE I CAN TELL. RIGHT? 2019 CHINA WAS GOING TO OVERTAKE HIS PRIDE WHEN YOU GO BACK SIX MONTHS, SEVEN MONTHS, NOT ONLY WEREN'T THEY OVERTAKEN, WE WERE BEATING THEM BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS AND GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER AND GROWING AND GROWING. AND TAXING THEM, AND TAXING THEM AND TAKEN BILLIONS AND BILLIONS IN TARIFFS. WHEN THEY TARGETED IOWA AND THE FARMERS OF THIS COUNTRY AND RANCHERS AND OTHERS, I SAID NO, NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT. NO NO YOU CAN'T SUM UP AT 25% TARIFF ON EVERYTHING. : : WE TOOK CARE OF OUR FARMERS. KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID THAT AND THAT'S WHY CHINA GOT AWAY WITH ALL THE STUFF FOR YEARS AND WE ARE PLENTY OF MONEY LEFT OVER AFTER THE $20 MILLION THAT WENT INTO THE U.S. TREASURY. THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE A PRESIDENT LIKE OBAMA, WE ARE GOING TO TARGET YOUR FARMERS AND TARGET THE MIDDLE OF OUR COUNTRY AND OBAMA SAID WE HAD BETTER NOT GET INVOLVED. I SAID IF YOU DO IT, WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS WE ARE GOING TO GIVE A LOT OF THAT MONEY TO THE PEOPLE THEY ARE TARGETING. THE THING THAT MOST IMPRESSES ME ABOUT IOWA AND NEBRASKA AND A LOT OF OUR STATE IF YOU LOOK AND BY THE WAY MINNESOTA WAS SO GREAT. EVERYONE OF THEM WISCONSIN WAS INCREDIBLE BUT THEY NEVER CAME TO ME AND SAID SIR THEY ARE NOT ORDERING FROM US. HE NEVER SAID IT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID? THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO PUT UP AND I DIDN'T HEAR ONE FROM FAKE 'CNN.' THEY PUT PEOPLE ON TELEVISION THAT SAID I KNOW IT'S NOT GOOD BUT THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT. THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT. HE DID THE RIGHT THING. OTHERWISE IT PUTS ME IN A BAD NEGOTIATING POSITION AND YOU CAN'T REALLY NEGOTIATE. STUFF. I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT ABOUT FARMERS. IT'S INCREDIBLE AND THE OTHER THING I WON'T FORGET YOU DON'T MIND IF I GO OFF SCRIPT. ENOUGH WITH CRAZY HUNTER BIDEN MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A DAY. HE MADE IT BECAUSE OF HIS GREAT INTELLECT. BUT YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING, WHERE IS HUNTER? IS HUNTER HERE? HUNTER CONGRATULATIONS ON MAKING A LOT OF MONEY LAST YEAR. THE OTHER THING I REMEMBER IN THE WHITE HOUSE WE HAD 36 FARMERS COME TO SEE ME BUT I'LL NEVER FORGET IT AND THEY WERE GETTING HIT REALLY HARD. THIS WAS TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO AND THEY CAME IN TO SEE ME. THEY SAID SIR WE ARE HURTING BUT YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS MEETING. I HAVE PICTURES OF IT. MANY FROM IOWA BUT FROM OTHER STATES THAT MANY FROM IOWA AND EVERYONE IS ALWAYS ASKING ME FOR MONEY. I WANT MONEY AND COUNTRIES WANT MONEY. PLEASE DEFEND US AND THEN THEY RIP US OFF ON TRADE. WE DEFEND THEM AND THEY RIP US OFF ON TRADE. THERE ARE IS ASKING FOR MONEY. I SAID TO THEM YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO? I'M GOING TO GET YOU A LOT OF MONEY WITH TARIFFS AND THIS IS EARLY ON IN THE STRATEGY. I'M GOING TO SUBSIDIZE YOU GUYS AND YOU WILL BE SO HAPPY AND I USED A TERRIBLE WORD. THEY SAID MAY I SPEAK? YEAH WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY. WE DON'T WANT ALL WE WANT IS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING. IT'S TRUE. I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT. MOST PEOPLE DON'T CARE CALL IT SUBSIDY GET ME CASH, JUST GIVE ME MONEY. THE FARMER SAID AND BY THE WAY I CONCEDE THERE WAS A CHILL IN THE ROAD AND I SAID THAT I SAY SOMETHING WITH RON? THE FARMERS ARE UNBELIEVABLE OR THEY ARE THE HEART OF THIS NATION AND THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT SUBSIDY. WE DON'T WANT THAT. WE JUST WANT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. WE WILL BEAT ANYBODY. AND TO THIS DAY I TELL THAT STORY ALL THE TIME. MOST PEOPLE CAN CALL IT ANYTHING YOU WANT. YOU CALL IT SUBSIDY ANYTHING YOU WANT. I JUST THINK YOU PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLE. ENOUGH OF THAT. ENOUGH OF THAT. ENOUGH OF THAT ARE. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR IOWA IS THE WHOLE THING THAT HAPPENED WITH ETHANOL. THEY WERE KILLING ETHANOL AND JOE BIDEN HAS VOWED TO ABOLISH ABOLISH THIS CRUSADE TO ELIMINATE GUESTS AND HIS RUNNING MATE SPONSORS ARE INSANE. SHE'S THE MOST LIBERAL. AND BY THE WAY DID MIKE PENCE BEAT HER BADLY? YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION IN BOXING? AS MY FRIEND WOULD SAY UFC. IF THAT WERE A FIGHT THEY WOULD HAVE STOPPED IT. MIKE PENCE, WE LOVE MIKE PENCE AND HE LOVES IOWA TWO. HE JUST LEFT. THE BIDEN/HARRIS PLATFORM WILL DEMOLISH IOWA ETHANOL. YOU KNOW THAT. WIPING OUT THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY. WE WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING WHERE WE HAD NO DEMAND BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND WE ALL FOUGHT HARD TO KEEP IT GOING AND KEEP THE ETHANOL GOING. WE DID THE 12 MONTHS. I DID 12 MONTHS. REMEMBER WAS EIGHT MONTHS AND I SAID WHY NOT 12? THEY COULDN'T GIVE ME A VERY GOOD ANSWER BUT I MADE IT YEAR ROUND AT 15%, UP FROM 10, 15%. WHEN THE MARKET COMES BACK WHICH IT IS COMING BACK. YOU HAVE BEEN EXPENSIVE GASOLINE AND THAT'S NOT SO BAD. YOU NEVER SEE GASOLINE WITH A TWO IN THE FRONT OF IT AND WE SAVED THEIR ENERGY JOBS. WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT WHEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ENERGY I CALL THE RUSSIA AND I CALLED SAUDI ARABIA AND THEY INCREASE PRODUCTION BY 10 MILLION BARRELS A DAY AND OUR ENTIRE ENERGY WAS SAVED ALL OVER THE WORLD FRANKLY. THEY AREN'T DOING IT US BUT THEY ARE DOING IT FOR EVERYBODY AND WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE COUNTRY. WE SAVED THEIR ENERGY INDUSTRY ARE ENERGY JOBS AND WE ARE ENERGY INDEPENDENT AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. AND BY THE WAY I MADE A PROMISE THAT MOST OF YOU UNDERSTAND FOR THOSE PEOPLE IN THE ETHANOL WORLD, YOU COULD USE THE PUMPS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? ANOTHER WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN NEW PUMPS BECAUSE WITH THE ADDITIONAL ETHANOL THE ADDITIONAL POWER SOME PEOPLE SAY MAKE THEM BUY A NEW PUMPS. I DON'T WANT YOU TO BUY NEW PUMPS SO FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTOOD WHAT I JUST SAID YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT WILL BE OKAY. TO DEFEND OUR RIGHTS AND OUR CONSTITUTION I NOMINATED JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. AND I WILL TELL YOU I DON'T MIND RUNNING AGAINST SLEEPY JOE BUT I WOULDN'T WANT TO RUN AGAINST HER RIGHT NOW. PLEASE PROMISE ME ANY ME YOU WILL NEVER RUN. SHE HAS BEEN GREAT. SHE'S OUTSMARTING THESE PEOPLE WITH BAD INTENTIONS. YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING ASKED AND IT'S SO OBVIOUS. THESE ARE NOT GREAT CHESS PLAYERS, LET'S FACE IT. THEY AREN'T GREAT, THEY ARE HORRIBLE AND NASTY AND SHE HANDLES IT LIKE NOTHING. SHE'S THE GREATEST AND ONE OF THE REASONS SHE HAS A HIGHLY RESPECTED FOR FASTER HAS BEEN TEACHING FOR MANY YEARS SAID SHE WAS THE SINGLE GREATEST IN HE'S EVER HAD. I BELIEVE AND THAT KIND OF THING. IT'S CALLED INTELLIGENCE. I BELIEVE IN INTELLIGENCE BUT I JUST WANT I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TURN A FEW DAYS AND I WANT TO SAY THAT WE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE, RIGHT? AND SPEAKING ABOUT MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE YOU MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE A LONG TIME AGO WITH A MAN NAMED SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY. AND YOU MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE AND YOU WERE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN I HOPE BECAUSE SHE IS GREAT, JONI ERNST. AND THERE RIGHT NOW AND WASHINGTON FIGHTING TO CONFIRM OUR GREAT NEW JUSTICE OR FUTURE JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. JOHNNY HAS BEEN FANTASTIC AND SHE'S BEEN FIGHTING FOR IOWA'S VALUES FOR A LONG TIME. SHE WILL CALL ME, AND WE DO THIS? NOBODY CALLED ME MORE ETHANOL THAN JOHNNY AND CHECK. I USED TO SAY TELL THEM I'M NOT IN. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE JOHNNY. BUT THAT'S WHAT A GOOD SENATOR IS. THEY WANT TO KEEP YOUR STATE GOING AND KEEP OUR COUNTRY GOING. THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND THEY LOVE THE STATE THAT THEY REPRESENT SO JONI ERNST INVESTIGATOR IN AND CHECK GRASSLEY WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HIM. HE WILL BE AROUND FOREVER. HE IS GREAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT CHUCK GRASSLEY? HE HAS THAT GREAT VOICE EVEN WHEN HE'S BEING NICE HE SOUNDS LIKE THE TOUGHEST GUY AND HE'S BEING NICE. HE LOOKED AT THE CORRUPT AT THE EYE DIRECTOR, HE LOOKED AT CALL ME, CORRUPT GUY AND HE JUST SAID DID YOU LEAVE AND CALL ME JUMPED AND HE SAID YES I DID. I WILL NEVER FORGET CHUCK GRASSLEY AND HE DIDN'T MEAN IT TO BE MEAN. HE JUST HAS THAT ROUGH VOICE. DID YOU LEE? I GAVE IT TO MY COLLEGE PROFESSOR FRIEND FROM COLUMBUS. WHAT A PIECE OF WORK HE IS. IF DEMOCRATS WHEN THEY WILL PACK THE SUPREME COURT WITH RADICAL LEFT JUDGES. WHO WILL SHRED OUR 2ND AMENDMENT AND IF THEY WIN YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT IS GONE. THEY WILL AND POWER VIOLENT MOBS AND KILLED TARIFFS. JOE BIDEN REFUSES TO EVEN ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT PACKING THE SUPREME COURT. HOW ABOUT THIS? DO YOU WANT TO PACK THE COURT? I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY DON'T ASK THEM. ME IT WOULD BE LIKE FORGET IT. YOU ARE GOING TO PACK THE COURTS ARE? I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER THAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SAY. NEXT QUESTION. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF OUR COUNTRY AND WE CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN AND THE OTHER THING IS I PUT UP A LIST OF 45 GREAT BRILLIANT CONSERVATIVE IN OUR CASE JUSTICES THAT GO BY THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN ETC., ETC.. HE HAS GOT TO PUT UP THE NAME OF JUSTICES OR JUDGES WHOEVER HE PICKS TO BECOME A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT. HE'S NOT DOING THAT AND THEY AREN'T ASKING THAT QUESTION. DID YOU SEE THE NBC THING LAST WEEK WHERE THEY HAD AN NBC TOWN HALL? IT WAS DESIGNED FOR A CHILD. WHEN I GET IN THEY ASK ME THINGS THAT NOBODY EVER CONTEMPLATED COULD BE THOUGHT OF. THEY ARE ASKING HIM THESE QUESTIONS IN NBC TOOK A LOT OF HEAT. IT TOOK A LOT OF HEAT. BIDEN'S AGENDA WOULD BE A CATASTROPHE FOR IOWA SENIORS. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT BUT FOR YEARS BIDEN TRIED TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? YOU DO KNOW HE WANTED TO CUT YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY AND YOUR MEDICARE AND NOW BIDEN'S PLEDGING MASK AMNESTY AND FEDERAL HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS DECIMATING MEDICARE AND IS GROWING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. THE PROBLEM IS WE ALL HAVE A HEART. I SAY IT ALL THE TIME. I LOVE TO TAKE YOUR RIVER BY THE ALL THE WORLD BUT THE PROBLEM IS OUR COUNTRY CAN AFFORD IT IF YOU START SAYING WE ARE GOING TO GIVE FREE EDUCATION WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU MEDICARE AND HEALTH CARE WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING OUR COUNTRY WILL BE FLOODED WITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT WILL COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. THEY WILL DECIMATE OUR COUNTRY. BIDEN CARES ABOUT ILLEGAL ALIENS BUT HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT SENIOR CITIZENS AND REMEMBER WHEN I ASKED THE QUESTION AT THE DEBATE WERE THE DEMOCRATS WERE OUT THERE AND YOU HAD ALL THESE DEMOCRATS THAT STARTED OFF WITH 26 AND I SAID THERE'S NO WAY THEY'LL PICK, LUCK BECAUSE SHE TREATED HIM WORSE THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND HER POLL NUMBERS WERE DROPPING LIKE A ROCK. THEY ASKED WHO WAS GOING TO GIVE MONEY, HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS AND THEY ALL RAISED THEIR HANDS. REMEMBER JOE? HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. AT LEAST HE HASN'T EXCUSE BECAUSE HE IS NO CLUE WHAT THE HELL THEY ARE ASKING BUT REMEMBER IS POSITIONED? THEIR HANDS ARE ALL UP. WE ARE GOING TO GIVE HER A LOT OF MONEY AND FORGET ABOUT ALL OF YOU PEOPLE. THAT'S A BIG CROWD BY THE WAY. LOOK AT THAT. TURN THOSE CAMERAS, PLEASE. LOOK AT THAT YOUTHFUL CROWD. REMEMBER JOE IS STANDING THERE AND PEOPLE CAN COME INTO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. THEY COME IN AT LEGALLY AND UNDER PLAN THEY HAVE THE MANIFESTO AND THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM A LAWYER. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED ARE WE NEED ARE SMALL LAWYERS NAPPER THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM A LAWYER AND THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE BUT THEY ASKED THE QUESTION AND I SAID WOW BECAUSE I THINK THEY HAVE LIKE 26 PEOPLE ORIGINALLY BUT EVERYONE OF THEM RAISED THEIR HANDS INCLUDING SLEEPY JOE. WHAT HAPPENED IS JOE YOU COULD SEE FOR 47 YEARS HE KNOWS THIS IS ISN'T GOING TO WORK. HE SANG TO HIMSELF AS YOU KNOW THEY ARE STILL SOMETHING LEFT, NOT MUCH BUT HE SANG TO HIMSELF IF THE NATURAL INSTINCTIVE POLITICAL INSTINCT AND HIS SHOULDER WENT UP AND THEN HIS HEAD. SO I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT GOING TO HOLD THEM. HOW ABOUT THE NO FRACKING? WE WILL NOT FRACK. DO YOU UNDERSTAND DO WE WILL NOT AND THEN HE GETS THE NOMINATION GOES TO PENNSYLVANIA WHERE THEY ARE RELIANT ON ENERGY AND FRACKING IS A JOB. PROBABLY 900 JOBS. THE DAY AFTER HE SAYS HE IS NOT FRACKING HE SAYS WE WILL FRACK. WE WILL FRACK AND THEY DON'T HOLD THEM TO IT BUT IF I DID THAT IT WOULD BE THE END BUT IT WILL NEVER BE THE END FOR US EITHER. NEVER GOING TO BE THE END. WE HAVE SOMETHING GOING THAT NOBODY HAS EVER HAD GOING. WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE THAT NOBODY IS EVER HAD NOT AS I DO THINK I'M A NICE GUY. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SUBURBIA, I'VE SAVE THE SUBURBS AND I HEARD I'M NOT DOING WELL WITH SUBURBAN WOMEN. I GOT RID THEY SAID THAT LAST ELECTION TOO. HE WILL DO TERRIBLY WITH WOMEN AND WHEN I DID GREAT WITH WOMEN THEY SAID MAN HE DID GREAT WITH WOMEN. THE SAME THING IS GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND, WOMEN PERIOD WANT SECURITY OR THEY DON'T WANT THEIR VALUES GOING DOWN. THEY DON'T WANT A LOW INCOME HOUSING PROJECT BUILT IN THE MIDDLE OF SUBURBIA NEXT TO THEIR HOUSE AND WE HAVE A RULE THAT IS A DISASTER. TO REGULATION I SET THE BEN CARSON OR THEY LOOKED AT ME AND THEY SAID WE CAN AMEND IT AND I SAID YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND I WANT IT TERMINATED. TO DISASTER OR THEY CHANGE THE ZONING AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE AND YOU END UP WITH LOW INCOME HOUSING OVER THE PLACE THE RIVER THIS 29 TO 30% OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN SUBURBIA ARE MINORITIES. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DISCRIMINATION AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING. WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH IS THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE AREN'T GOING TO DESTROY THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR STUPID PEOPLE LIKE CORY BOOKER. CORY BOOKER IN CHARGE. HOW ABOUT THAT ONE? HE DID A GREAT JOB AS MAYOR OF NEWARK, NEW JERSEY. HOW IS NEWARK DOING? THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN TRUMP RECOVERED AT A LEVEL THAT NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE AND A BIDEN DEPRESSION. IF THEY GET ELECTED THEY ARE GOING TO DOUBLE TRIPLE AND QUADRUPLE YOUR TAXES. YOU'LL HAVE THE DEPRESSION THE LIKES OF WHICH THIS COUNTRY HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND THAT PROBABLY INCLUDES 1929. ONE THING WE LEARNED ABOUT THE FARMERS THEY DON'T DO WELL IN DEPRESSIONS. DO WE AGREE? NOBODY DOES WELL IN THE DEPRESSION. YOU'LL HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE YOU'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE. JOE BIDEN WOULD TERMINATE A RECOVERY DELAY THE VACCINE PROLONGED THE PANDEMIC AND BY THE WAY FOR THOSE DATES OPEN UP YOUR STATES. WATCH ON NOVEMBER 4, NOVEMBER 4 ALL THESE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS THAT HAVE LOCKED DOWN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING IT WAS ME THEY CAME OUT FIRST. 20 YEARS AGO SOMEBODY SAID THE SAME THING BUT THEY CARE CANNOT BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. GET THE CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL. I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. 99% OF BARRON TRUMP YOU KNOW HE HAD HE HAD THE CORONA AND 19, THE CHINA VIRUS. YET 21 DIFFERENT NAMES. I COULD GO OVER IT BUT TAMIKA RUNNEMEDE ITALY. CHINA IS CHINA AND THEY CAME FROM CHINA SO WE HAVE THE CHINA VIRUS. HE HAD UP FOR SORT SUCH A SHORT TIME. THEY ARE YOUNG AND THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE STRONG AND THEY FIGHT IT OFF 99.9% AND BARRON'S IS BEAUTIFUL AND HE'S FREE, FREE. OUR FIRST LADY WHO LOVES IOWA BY THE WAY. SHE PUT OUT THAT BARRON HAS TESTED POSITIVE AND I SAID WOW AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT AND IT'S LIKE LET'S PUT IT OUT. BARRON TESTED POSITIVE AND WITHIN TWO SECONDS BARRON IS FINE NOW. HE TESTED NEGATIVE, RIGHT? WE HAVE GOT TO GET THE KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL. GET THEM BACK TO SCHOOL. GET THEM BACK. AND WHEN I ADDED YOU MIGHT HAVE. AND MOST OF YOU DON'T KNOW THIS BUT I HAVE IT TOO. I DIDN'T LOVE IT BUT YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH AND YET THE TEMPERATURE AND HE DON'T FEEL GOOD. THE SCARY PART IS WHERE THEY ARE GOING. YOU ARE AT 101 101 AND 102. EVAN HAD A TEMPERATURE IN YEARS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE AND I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLE HOSPITAL WALTER REED. I'VE BEEN THERE MANY TIMES FOR OUR GREAT WARRIORS TO COME BACK BADLY WOUNDED. AND ONE THING WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT I AM LYING IN HIS BED NOT FEELING MY BEST AND I'M SURROUNDED BY 12 DOCTORS. ONE IS THE HEAD OF JOHNS HOPKINS AND WHAT IS THE HEAD OF WALTER REED. THESE ARE INCREDIBLE DOCTORS AND I LOOKED AT THE ALTERNATIVES ALL THINGS WE DEVELOPED IN THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS AND ONE OF THEM WAS REGENERON. I SAID I WILL TAKE THAT ONE. VERY EARLY IN THE TESTING BUT IT HAD GREAT NUMBERS AND I'M TELLING YOU THEY GAVE ME THIS AND THEY CALL IT A THERAPEUTIC. TO ME IT'S SECURE. I I FELT LIKE SUPERMAN THE FOLLOWING MORNING. IN FACT I MADE A SPEECH ABOUT IT TWO DAYS LATER. SOMEBODY SAID HE LOOKS BETTER NOW THAN HE DID TWO WEEKS AGO. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE ARE MAKING TREMENDOUS PROGRESS. THE VACCINES ARE COMING OUT SOON PUT A LOT OF GREAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING ON THAT FRONT AND A LOT OF GREAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR OUR COUNTRY BUT I'M WORKING TO MAKE THE ANTIBODY TREATMENTS THAT I RECEIVED, I WANT TO GIVE IT TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT QUALIFY FOR IT, PEOPLE IN HOSPITALS AND PEOPLE JUST BEFORE THEY GO TO THE HOSPITAL. WE WILL CLEAN OUT HER HOSPITAL. ELI LILLY MAKES A SIMILAR DRUG AND WE ARE GOING TO DO IT FREE. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT FREE. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING EMERGENCY USE OP OR STATION AND WE ARE GOING TO REGENERON AND ELI LILLY A COMPARABLE DRUG. WE ARE GOING TO GIVE IT TO EVERYBODY AND I HOPE TO HAVE THE LUCK THAT I HAD. MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT. I DIDN'T NEED IT. I WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT ANYWAY. I SAID SARCASTIC WAY I'M IN NO DANGER BECAUSE I'M IN PERFECT PHYSICAL SHAPE AND I'M VERY YOUNG IN 'CNN' REPORTS PRESIDENT TRUMP LIED TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? THIS IS TELLING. WE HAD AN INCREDIBLE RALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA. SAID THEY WERE GOING TO 'CNN.' I THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING IT TO ME. WE DON'T HAVE TO MANY OF THEM ANY MORE. THE BEGINNING WE THOUGHT WE'D ALWAYS HAVE THE FUNNY PEOPLE STAND UP AND RAISE THEIR VOICE AND GET BALLED OUT. I SHOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN WE DON'T HAVE ANY DON'T HAVE THAT ANYMORE. I LEARNED ABOUT THE CAMERAS BECAUSE THE CAMERAS NEVER LIE. LOOK WHERE THAT CROWD GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE BUILDING. I NEVER THOUGHT THE CAMERAS COULD MOVE AND THEN I JUST NOTICED WHENEVER WE HAD A TROUBLEMAKER IN THE AUDIENCE THEY WOULD SPIN AROUND LIKE A PRETZEL. I THOUGHT THEY WERE LIKE RIGID LIKE A RIGID PIECE OF STEEL THAT DOESN'T TURN BUT WE HAVE THE BACKROOM BEHIND A PILLAR. THE CAMERA WOULD TURN AROUND LIKE A SNAKE AT DIFFERENT ANGLES. THAT SOUNDS GOOD. HER BRAND-NEW F-35 FIGHTER JET. YOU CAN'T SEE IT. THE GREATEST PLAY IN THE WORLD AND BY THE WAY SPEAKING UP THAT OUR MILITARY WHEN I CAME IN THE WORLD'S MOST OVERRATED GENERAL TOLD ME SIRTE WE HAVE NO AMMUNITION BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE HAD A CONFLICT EARLY AND COULD I SAID NO PRESIDENT SHOULD EVER HEAR THAT COULD WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY $2.5 TRILLION ALL PAID IN THE USA. THE LIKES OF WHICH NO COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. WE ARE THE ENVY OF RUSSIA AND CHINA AND ANY OTHER COUNTRY. WE HAVE EQUIPMENT THAT NOBODY HAS. OUR MISSILES AT OUR ROCKETS ARE NUCLEAR HAS BEEN TOTALLY UPGRADED AND PRAY TO GOD WE NEVER HAVE USED IT BECAUSE I SEE WHAT HAPPENS. PRAY TO GOD BUT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT WE COULD BE IN VERY BIG TROUBLE. A VERY TOUGH SITUATION BUT YOU LOOK AT THE NEW TANKS WE HAVE ORDERED FROM OHIO BY THE WAY. THE LIMA L PLANT. I SAID KEEP IT OPEN. BEFORE HE I BECAME PRESIDENT I SAID KEEP IT OPEN. I SAID WE COULD NEVER BUILD A PLANT LIKE THIS. YOU COULD NEVER GET THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE TOTALLY REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE THE GREATEST MISSILES ROCKETS FIGHTERS BOMBERS TANKERS SHIPS IN THE WORLD. WE ARE ALL MADE IN THE U.S.. USA, USA, USA. YOU CAN BE PROUD OF YOUR COUNTRY. LOOK AT THIS YOUNG HANDSOME FARMER ARE YOU GOING TO BE A FARMER SOMEDAY BLACKS HE GOES YALE. I WOULD LIKE TO BE A FARMER SOMETIMES. WE ARE JOINED TONIGHT BY SOME INCREDIBLE FRIENDS AND GREAT PEOPLE. YOUR GOVERNOR WHO'S DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB, KIM REYNOLDS AND KEVIN HER HUSBAND. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. A REALLY GREAT JOB, KIM. HOW ARE WE DOING? ARE WE LOOKING GOOD? THANK YOU FERVID THING KIM AS WELL AS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ADAM ADAM, THANK YOU. GREAT JOB. IOWA SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE, MIKE NAGY. THANK YOU, MIKE. IOWA SENATE MAJORITY LEADER JACK WHITMER. YOU KNOW WHY THEY ALL STAY TOGETHER, THEY LIKE EACH OTHER. SPEAKER OF THE IOWA HOUSE, YOU'VE GOT TO TELL ME THIS. THIS IS GOOD GENES I THINK. THERE ARE GENES INVOLVED HERE. PAT GRASSLEY. WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP, PAT? THAT'S GOOD STUFF. YOU'VE GOT A GOOD STOCK. I WANT TO BET ON THAT GUIDE FOR THE FUTURE. GREAT JOB AND YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. ARE WE DOING ALL RIGHT? AND TERRY BRANSTAD. DO WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE QUICK STORY ABOUT BRANSTAD? BECAUSE HIS SON AND HIS SON ERIC IS EVEN BETTER THAN HIM BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THEM AND HERE'S A GUY THAT DOESN'T MIND ME SAYING PUT A LOT OF FATHERS WOULD GET ANGRY IF YOU SAID THAT. THOSE ARE NOT GREAT FATHERS. HIS SON IS GREAT BUT WHEN I MET TERRY LONG BEFORE I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS I HEARD THE GOVERNOR OF IOWA IS IN NEW YORK AND HE WANTED TO SEE ME WHERE I SAID WHAT THE HELL DO I WANT TO SEE THE GOVERNOR OF IOWA FOR? I'M PUTTING UP BUILDINGS AND I'M SAYING ALL RIGHT AND I INVITED HIM. THEREFORE I THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THIS HE CAME UP AND A HUMBLE GUY A GREAT GUY A HANDSOME GUY SAT DOWN AND I FIGURED I'D GIVE HIM FIVE MINUTES, NO LONGER THAN FIVE AND I ENDED UP SPENDING AN HOUR AND A HALF. I SAID THAT'S A SMART AS THEN I LEARNED AS YOU KNOW HE WAS THE GOVERNOR FOR 24 YEARS AN ALL-TIME RECORD IN THE UNITED STATES, 24 YEARS. HE TOLD ME A STORY AT THE FIRST MEETING BEFORE I WAS EVEN THINKING ABOUT DOING THIS AND AGAIN IT'S ONLY BECAUSE OBAMA AND BIDEN WERE SO BAD. I SAID LET ME DO IT RIGHT I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO BUT I'M HAVING A LOT OF FUN BECAUSE WE ARE MAKING SUCH PROGRESS. HE TOLD ME A STORY HE SAID YOU KNOW MANY YEARS AGO I MET A MAN IN CHINA WHO WAS SELLING CORN. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? CORN, CROPS. HE WAS SELLING CORN AND HE SAID TO HIS WIFE THIS IS 35 OR 40 YEARS AGO HE SAID I MET A MAN IN CHINA AND I WENT HOME TO MY WIFE AND I SAID YOU KNOW I JUST MET THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF CHINA MANY YEARS FORWARD BUT I JUST MET A FUTURE PRESIDENT OF CHINA AND I SAID WHO WAS THAT? IT WAS PRESIDENT XI WHO IS NOW THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA AND THEY SAID YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. HE SAID I COULD TELL RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING HE WAS DIFFERENT AND I'M NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT'S GOING ON BUT HE SAID I JUST MET THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND THEN I REMEMBER THAT STORY AND IRAN AND HE WAS SO INCREDIBLE TO ME IN IOWA AND HE WANTED US TO WIN AND HIS SON WAS VERY MUCH IN CHARGE OF WHAT WE ARE DOING AND IT WORKED OUT GREAT AND WE WON BY A LOT AND THEN WE WON THE WHOLE THING. I SAID WE HAVE TO PICK SOMEBODY REALLY SMART FOR CHINA. THE GOVERNOR OF IOWA CAME TO ME AND TOLD ME THAT STORY AND I TOLD HIM HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE AMBASSADOR TO CHINA AND THE CENSORSHIP I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 24 HOURS AND IT WOULD BE AN HONOR NOT TO TELL YOU THIS HE REPRESENTED US GREAT WITH CHINA. HE REPRESENTED US. I NEVER TOLD THAT STORY. I NEVER TOLD THAT STORY BUT A MONTH AGO HE TOLD ME HE CENSORSHIP I WANT TO COME HOME NOW. IT DOES WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET REELECTED AND I WANT TO COME HOME AND I KNOW IS OUT THERE WORKING BUT WE LOVE HIM. HE'S A SPECIAL GUY. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF REAL DUTIES WITH GRASSLEY AND THIS GUY WHAT A COUPLE OF GREAT PEOPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EVERYTHING. A GREAT JOB YOU DID AS AMBASSADOR. THE ONLY QUESTION I HAVE IS DO WE CALL YOU MR. AMBASSADOR MR. GOVERNOR? WHAT DO YOU LIKE? HE SAID EITHER ONE IS OKAY. THAT'S HIM. ANYWAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT JOB. I WANT TO INTRODUCE ANOTHER ONE OF THE BEST MAY BE THE BEST IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE IOWA GOP, JEFF COSMAN. YOU LOOK GOOD, JEFF. YOU HAVE LOST WEIGHT, JEFF. I'M PROUD OF YOU JEFF. YOU DO A GREAT JOB. HOW ARE WE DOING? ALWAYS BE CAREFUL. REMEMBER WHEN HE SAID HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND HE WAS DOING OKAY AND HE WAS ON THE COVER OF A THIRD-RATE MAGAZINE CALLED 'VANITY FAIR' AND HE MADE THE STATEMENT I WAS BORN TO DO THIS. THAT'S THE END OF HIS POLITICAL CAREER. HE WAS BORN TO DO IT. THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT. CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE A STAR A GUY WHO'S GOING TO BE FANTASTIC DAVID YOUNG. YOU HAVE A LOT OF GOOD CANDIDATES. WE ARE ALSO JOINED BY A VERY SPECIAL GUEST ONE OF THE GREATEST WRESTLERS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? HE'S AN UNBELIEVABLE GUY. I'VE KNOWN ABOUT THEM FOR A LONG TIME AM DO WE ALL LOVE JIM JORDAN OR CONGRESSMAN, RIGHT? JIM JORDAN, JIM JORDAN IS A GREAT WRESTLER AND A GREAT NCAA CHAMPION. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT THE GEM IS FROM OHIO. HE SAYS THE GREATEST OF THEM ALL WAS A GUY NAMED DAN GABLE GABLE. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF DAN GABLE? AND LISTEN TO THIS I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TELL YOU IS BANNED HERE ARE? COME HERE, COME ON. YOU MEAN I CAN'T TAKE THIS GUY IN A FIGHT? CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? WOW. I AM IMMUNE AND I CAN'T GIVE IT TO YOU SO THAT'S GOOD. WE LOVE YOU. I MET DAN A FEW YEARS AGO AND I LOOKED AT HIM AND I SAID HOW COME HE IS 80 AND HE WON 181. THAT'S LIKE CRAZY, 181. I'M GOING TO ASK A LEADER WHO IS THE ONE THAT HE DID SOMETHING ELSE WON THE OLYMPICS IN 1972. AND TO DO THAT HE HAD TO WRESTLE AGAINST THE SIXTH GREATEST WRESTLERS IN THAT WEIGHT CLASS IN THE WORLD AND HE DID SOMETHING NEVER DONE BEFORE. HE DIDN'T YIELD ONE POINT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE THING. AND HE ENDED UP IN THE OLYMPIC FINAL FOR THE GOLD MEDAL. HE BEAT THE GREAT RUSSIAN WRESTLER. HE WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING AND NOBODY GOT POINT AND I'M LOOKING AT HIM AND SAYING TO MYSELF I'M TELLING YOU I CAN TAKE HIM BUT I BETTER NOT TRY. DAN HAS BEEN INDUCTED INTO THE USA WRESTLING HALL OF FAME THE U.S. OLYMPIC HALL OF FAME AND THE UNITED WORLD WRESTLING HALL OF FAME. HE HAS BECOME UNIVERSITY OF IOWA'S ALL-TIME MOST WINNING COACH. BACKED JIM JORDAN SAID HE WAS AS GREAT A COACH AS HE WAS A WRESTLER. HOW MANY CHAMPIONSHIPS TO DO WHEN? 15. I COME FROM A TOWN WHERE THEY SAY THEY NEVER WIN. HE WON 15. THAT'S CALLED EXTRAORDINARY TALENT ACTUALLY. I THOUGHT ABOUT IT LONG AND HARD SO THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR AND THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM ARE THE TWO GREATEST AWARDS YOU CAN GET IN OUR COUNTRY AND I'M PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT I WILL BE AWARDING VERY SHORTLY AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE OVAL OFFICE COACH GABLE THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM. SAY SOMETHING. HE'S THE PRIDE OF EYE WHEN HE'S GREAT. YOU TRY TO FIGURE OUT A GOOD-LOOKING GOOD LOOKING GUY ALL THAT STUFF BUT WHY IS HE WON 81. HE DIDN'T ALLOW ONE POINT. THEY ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD OF THE TOUGHEST HAD SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND YOU'LL PROBABLY NEVER FIGURED OUT IT'S WITH GREAT CHAMPIONS YOU SEE IT ALL THE TIME. THERE ARE VERY FEW JACK NICKLAUS AND TIGER GOT THE SAME AWARD WENT TIGER WON THE MASTERS A FEW MONTHS AGO. THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE THING YOU DID AND WE GAVE HIM THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM. I SAID TIGER YOU DESERVE IT. I WENT THROUGH A LOT AND HE CAME BACK AND HE SAID THAT YOU HAVE GREAT CHAMPIONS AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT. IN NOBODY KNOWS WHY. THAT MAN IS DIFFERENT AND HE'S A CHAMPION AND IT'S AN HONOR TO PRESIDENT YOU TO THE PEOPLE THAT LOVE YOU THE MOST, IOWA. UNDER MIKE MYSTERY SHOULD WE BUILD THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND NOW WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO SEE SOME VERY BIG NUMBERS AND YOU ARE SEEING IT. MY FIRST THREE YEARS FAMILY INCOME INCREASED BY $6000. THAT'S MORE THAN FIVE TIMES THE GAINS IN ALL EIGHT YEARS UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION. AFRICAN-AMERICAN INCOME GREW NINE TIMES MORE THAN IT DID UNDER BIDEN AND OBAMA. WE LIFTED 6.6 MILLION AMERICANS OUT OF POVERTY. AFRICAN-AMERICAN EMPLOYMENT, HISPANIC AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT AND ASIAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT ALL REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN HISTORY. AT THE END OF THE LAST ADMINISTRATION THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE PROJECTED FEWER THAN 2 MILLION JOBS WOULD BE CREATED OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND WE CRASHED THAT REJECTION AND CREATED ALMOST 8 MILLION JOBS. NOBODY COULD BELIEVE IT. WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN. MY POLICIES THAT BENEFITED THOSE WHO NEEDED IT THE MOST. THE BOTTOM 50% OF HOUSEHOLDS SAW AN ASTONISHING 40% INCREASE IN NET WORTH AFTER OUR TAX CUTS WAGES GREW FASTER. IT MAKES ME FEEL SO GOOD. BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS WERE THE ONES THAT HAVE THE BIGGEST BENEFIT FROM WHAT WE DID. SINCE THE CHINA VIRUS WE HAVE CREATED A RECORD 11.4 MILLION JOBS A RECORD, WE'D NEVER CREATED JOBS AT THE LEVEL WE ARE CREATING THEM NOW. WE HAVE GOT THE EMPLOYMENT RATE IN HALF. WE ARE DOWN TO 7.8%. SOUNDS HIGH BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID WE WOULD BE AT 42% WITHOUT THE 7.8 AND GOING DOWN RAPIDLY. UNDER BIDEN AT 630 MONTHS TO RECOVER MORE THAN HALF OF THE JOBS LOST, 30 MONTHS. WE DID IT IN FIVE MONTHS. JOBS HAVE BEEN RECOVERING GREAT THINK OF THOSE, JOBS HAVE BEEN RECOVERING 23 TIMES FASTER THAN THE OBAMA-BIDEN RECOVERY. 23 TIMES FASTER. NOT 23%, 23 TIMES FASTER. I'VE SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS REVERSING THE DAMAGE JOE BIDEN INFLICTED OVER THE LAST 47 YEARS. HE SUPPORTED NAFTA, A DISASTER. NOW YOU HAVE USMCJ. HE SUPPORTED PCP. WOULD HAVE DESTROYED YOUR FARMS IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY WOULD HAVE BEEN GONE AND SUPPORTED CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION A CATASTROPHE FOR OUR NATION. CHINA TRIED TO GET AWAY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DEVELOPING NATION NOT ANY MORE. IF BIDEN WINS CHINA WINS AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. LEIDEN WINS CHINA WILL OWN OUR COUNTRY. THEY WILL OWN IT. IF WE WIN IOWA WINS IN AMERICA WINS AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOR A LONG TIME. FOR DECADES ARE POLITICIANS TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS REBUILDING FIGHTING FOREIGN WARS AND DEFENDING FOREIGN BORDERS BUT NOW WE ARE FINALLY PROTECTING OUR NATION REBUILDING OUR CITIES AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR JOBS, OUR FACTORIES AND OUR TROOPS BACK HOME TO THE USA WHERE THEY BELONGED. AND AS I MENTIONED ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME WAS TO ELIMINATE THE VERY UNFAIR ESTATE TAX OR DEATH TAX OR SMALL BUSINESSES AND FARMS SO IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILD AND YOU ARE FARMER AND YOU THINK HE OR SHE IS DOING A GREAT JOB AND SHE WANTS TO KEEP THE FARMER HE WANTS TO KEEP THE FARM THERE IS NO MORE A STATE TAX. YOU'D HAVE TO BORROW FORTUNES IS PAY THE TAX. IS THERE ANYBODY HERE WHO HAS A CHILD FOR WHICH THEY DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE FARM BECAUSE THEY DO NOT LIKE THEIR CHILD? RAISE YOUR HAND, THERE IS ONE PERSON OVER THERE. BUT IT'S A BIG THING. A LOT OF FARMS ARE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS AND THEIR PARENTS PASSED AWAY AND THEY LEAVE THE FARM TO THE SUN THE DAUGHTER OF THE FAMILY AND THE FAMILY HAS TO BORROW FORTUNES AND THEN THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF BAD SEASONS AND THEY END UP LOSING EVERYTHING. WE DON'T HAVE THAT ANYMORE. WE CUT THE ESTATE TAX AND NOW IT'S GONE. THESE ARE THINGS A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW. ALONG WITH THE TAX CUTS WE GOT THERE. BIDEN WANTS TO REPEAL OR TAX CUTS AND MASSIVELY RAISE TAXES ON THE FAMILY FARMS AND WHAT WE DID WAS YOU KNOW EXACTLY, WE HIT IT SO QUICKLY. WE HIT SO HARD, WE HIT SO STRONG ON THIS WHOLE TAX SITUATION BECAUSE THE FARMERS WERE BEING UNTREATED BEING TREATED SO UNFAIRLY WITH RESPECT TO TAXES. I QUICKLY ISSUED A MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION AND I WILL BE WITH YOU EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. CAMEL PHASE OR GOVERNOR YOU ARE LIKE A LARGE-SCALE SWIMMING POOL. I HATE TO SAY I IT I WHY LOOKED AT THE PICTURES AND THEY SAID KIM I NEVER KNEW THAT THIS WAS OCEANFRONT PROPERTY. WE GAVE YOUR THING YOU NEEDED AND WE REBUILT THE DAMS IN THE. WE REBUILT IT FAST AND MY OPPONENT HAS A RADICAL PLAN TO ELIMINATE U.S. BORDERS LIGHT IMPLEMENTING CATCH AND RELEASE IMPOSING DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES AND REMOVAL OF ILLEGAL ALIENS OF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S A MURDER OR RAPIST THEY AGREE WITH BERNIE SANDERS, CRAZY BERNIE BUT THERE'S NOBODY THAT KNOWS HOW TO LOSE LIKE ERNIE. FOUR YEARS AGO HE WENT HOME HAPPY. POCAHONTAS REFUSED TO GET OUT OF THE RACE OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RUNNING AGAINST BERNIE. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE ENTHUSIASM FOR BERNIE A SMALLER BASE TO MOURN LOUISIANA SOME. WE ARE GOING TO GET A LOT OF THE BERNIE VOTERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE GEL AND THEY LOVE OUR POLICIES ON DEALING WITH OTHER NATIONS. THEY LOVE OUR POLICY AND TRADE BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND. THEY HAPPEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ALSO KNOW WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. BERNIE WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT FOR THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE COMPLETELY OVERRUN IN A MATTER OF DAYS. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP WE ACHIEVE THE MOST SECURE BORDER IN U.S. HISTORY AND WE ARE FINISHING THE WAR. NOW OVER 400 MILES LONG. MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL. WE DID MORE COULD ONE OF THESE FAKE REPORTER SAID IT. WHAT ARE THE ONLY POLITICIANS THAT HAS EVER RUN, ONE OF THE ONLY POLITICIANS THAT HAS RUN THAT HAS DONE MORE THAN HE OR SHE HAS PROMISED. AS AN EXAMPLE I CAMPAIGNED A LOT IN IOWA. HE NEVER MENTIONED THE WORD SPACE FORCE BUT WHEN I GOT INTO OFFICE I REALIZE I LOOK AT RUSSIA AND THEY LOOK TO KIM JONG-UN AND I LOOK AT CHINA SAID WE NEED A SPACE FORCE. WE GOT A SPACE FORCE WHERE AND NEVER TALKED ABOUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. WE ALSO PASSED VA ACCOUNTABILITY FOR GREAT VETERANS. NOW INSTEAD OF WAITING IN LINE FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS IF THEY HAVE TO WAIT THEY GO TO A DOCTOR AND WE PAID THE BILL. 91% APPROVAL RATING IN THE VA. THEY ARE DOING A GREAT JOB OVER THERE. I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BECAUSE SOME PLACES AREN'T HAPPY BUT THINK OF THIS. ALL OUR LIVES WE THOSE IN THE EVENING NEWS HORROR SHOWS WITH THE FATS AND IT'S TERRIBLE WHAT THEY ARE DOING. YOU DON'T SEE ANY STORIES ABOUT THE VA. WE HAVE DONE 91% APPROVAL RATING BY THE VA FOR THE JOB WE ARE DOING. AND WE DEFEATED 100%, BRINGING OUR SOLDIERS HOME BUT WE DEFEATED 100% OF THE ISIS CALIPHATE IN SYRIA AND IRAQ. WHEN I TOOK OVER WAS A MESS. AND WE KILLED THE LEADER OF ISIS AL-BAGHDADI. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR HIM FOR YEARS AND YEARS. WEAVE THAT TOGETHER WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST AND THE MASK MURDER OF AMERICAN TROOPS AND MANY OTHER TROOPS AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE KASIM ACELA MANI IS DEAD. ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS TO HAPPEN IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN 50 YEARS. I WITHDREW FROM THE LAST ADMINISTRATION'S DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR CATASTROPHE. $150,000,000,000.1.8 MILLION IN CASH FOR NOTHING. THE DEAL IS EXPIRING NOW ANYWAY IF WE DIDN'T TERMINATE IT. I KEPT MY PROMISE RECOGNIZE THE TRUE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. AND YOU KNOW PRESIDENTS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT FOR DECADES. EVERY OF PRESIDENT SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO IT AND THEY NEVER HAVE THE GUTS TO DO IT AND I ALSO RECOGNIZE ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. 52 YEARS THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT. I GOT IT DONE IN ABOUT TWO HOURS. AND INSTEAD OF AN ENDLESS WAR WE ARE FORGING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. I GET NOMINATED FOR THREE NOBEL PEACE PRIZES. AND I TOLD THE STORY THE OTHER NIGHT. I WAS IN FLORIDA AND PENNSYLVANIA AND I TOLD OUR FIRST LADY DARLING WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE GREATEST PUBLICITY I'VE EVER HAD TONIGHT. I GOT NOMINATED FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS DARLING. I GET HOME AND I TURN ON THE TELEVISION AND YOU'RE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FLOODS IN IOWA AND HOW IS THIS HAPPENING? HOW ARE THEY DOING IN FLORIDA? STORIES ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND WHERE IS MY NOBEL PEACE PRIZE? THE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW DARLING THIS NEWS IS A LITTLE TOUGH TO. WHEN OBAMA GOT HIS NOBEL PRIZE HE DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING AND HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE GOT IT FOR. THEY SAID WHY DID YOU GET IT AND HE SAID I HAVE NO IDEA. IT WAS THE BIGGEST STORY ALL OVER THE PLACE. I GOT THREE NOMINATIONS AND NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT. I MIGHT AS WELL MENTION IT. KIM I SHOULD MENTION IT. KEVIN, RIGHT? KEVIN STAND UP PLEASE. THERE IS THE GUY. WE WENT ON A HUNTING TRIP. MY SON DON LOVES HUNTING AND THREE OF THE GOVERNORS TERRY PREVIOUS GOVERNORS WENT HUNTING AND IT WAS 25 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. THE ONLY TWO GUYS THAT STOOD OUT THERE THE WHOLE TIME WERE KEVIN AND DONALD TRUMP JR.. EVERYONE ELSE WAS BACK IN 15 MINUTES AND THEY ARE ALL BACK AND THEY WANTED TO GO BACK INTO THE LODGE. AFTER WEEKEND MY SON COMES BACK AND KEVIN COMES BACK. YOU TWO GUYS DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT ABOUT DON THE CABINET IS FANTASTIC. THANK YOU KEVIN FOR BEING HERE. HE'S A REAL GUY. I'M ENDING THE WARS AND BIDEN WILL LEAD US INTO NEW WARS. WE DID MORE IN 47 MONTHS AND BIDEN DID IN 47 YEARS AND THAT IS A FACT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEMOCRATS THEY ARE PUSHING THE MOST FAR LEFT AGENDA EVER PUT FORWARD BY A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE. THEIR PLAN WOULD DESTROY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, DESTROY PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. BIDEN VOWED TO TERMINATE OUR TRAVEL BAN AND JIHADIST REGIONS. I GOT THE TRAVEL BAN. IT'S NOT NICE TO COME UP AND BLOW UP CITIES EITHER. WE WON IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND HE ONCE ENDED. 700% OPENING THE FLOODGATES TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS. NO THANK YOU, NO THANK YOU SLEEPY JOE. HE WILL BAN SCHOOL CHOICE AND BAND CHARTER SCHOOLS, VERY IMPORTANT PLACES WHERE IT ALL STARTS. CIVIL RIGHTS STARTS WITH EDUCATION AND WE NEED SCHOOL CHOICE. AND MY SECOND TERM I WILL PROVIDE SCHOOL CHOICE TO EVERY PARENT IN AMERICA. WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED. WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE THING BECAUSE IT'S GREAT EDUCATION WERE LESS MONEY. LESS MONEY, GREAT EDUCATION JUST THE SHORT A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS AS THEY VOTE FOR SAFE COMMUNITIES GREAT JOBS AND A LIMITLESS FUTURE FOR ALL OVER AMERICANS. OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WE WILL MAKE AMERICA INTO THE MANUFACTURING SUPERPOWER OF THE WORLD AND WE WILL END OUR RELIANCE ON CHINA ONCE AND FOR ALL. WE WILL HIRE MORE POLICE COME INCREASE PENALTIES FOR ASSAULTS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE WILL BAN DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES. WE WILL UPHOLD RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, FREE SPEECH AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS, YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT. WE WILL STRIKE DOWN TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN OUR CITIZENS AND WE WILL KEEP AMERICA OUT OF RIDICULOUS HORRIBLE AND LESS FOREIGN WARS. WE WILL MAINTAIN AMERICA'S UNRIVALED MILITARY MIGHT. WE HAVE NEVER EVER BEEN CLOSE TO A STRONG AS WE ARE RIGHT NOW, THE GREATEST EQUIPMENT EVER IN OUR HISTORY AND WE WILL ENSURE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. IF YOU REMEMBER WHEN IRAN THEY SAID HE'S A MILITANT KIND OF THE GUY. WE WILL BE IN AWARD THE FIRST WEEK. WHERE IS THE WAR? AND I'M MAKING OTHER COUNTRIES PAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW NATO, THEY WERE PAYING THEIR BILLS. THEY WERE DELINQUENT TO USE THE NEW YORK REAL ESTATE TERM. I SAID YOU'VE GOT TO PAPER THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF NATO IS MY SINGLE BIGGEST FAN. THEY ARE PAYING $130 BILLION A YEAR MORE NOW BECAUSE I SAID LOOK YOU HAVE GOT TO PAY. THEY RIP US ON. AND WE ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT THEM THE EUROPEAN UNION. NATO PAYING 130 MILLION MORE GOING TO $410 MILLION MORE EACH YEAR, SO THAT'S IT. HE IS GOING TO GET US INTO A WAR. WHERE OF THE. WHERE ARE THE WORST? THEY DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THEM AND NOBODY WANTS ANY PART OF THEM. WE WERE TIRED OF BEING RIPPED OFF AS A COUNTRY. WE WILL END SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING. YOU KNOW THE SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING IS A DISASTER. IT'S ENDING AS OF JANUARY 1. REQUIRED PRICE TRANSPARENCY ALL SIGNED AND ALL DONE JANUARY 1. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I LOSE AND I'VE DONE ALL THESE THINGS? THE KICK IN ON JANUARY 1 YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THAT BIDEN HAS DONE A GREAT JOB WITH PRICE TRANSPARENCY? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT IS IN FURTHER REDUCE THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WE WENT TO A FAVORED NATION CLAUSE SO WE WILL PAY THE LOWEST DRUG PRICES IN THE WORLD, OKAY? WE WILL STRONGLY PROTECT MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AMERICA WILL LAND THE FIRST WOMAN ON THE MOON AND UNITED STATES. WE'LL BE THE FIRST NATION TO LAND AN ASTRONAUT ON MARS. AND WHEN I TOOK OVER NASA WAS BASICALLY CLOSE WAS SHREDDED AND IT WAS NOTHING AND NOW IT'S THE NUMBER ONE PREEMINENT SPACE SECTOR ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BY FAR. WE WILL STOP THE RADICAL INDOCTRINATION OF OUR STUDENTS AND RESTORE PATRIOTIC EDUCATION. WE WILL TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY AND ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN PLAN. AND WE WILL LIVE BY THE TIMELESS WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MODEL, IN GOD WE TRUST. THAT WON'T CHANGE. FOR YEARS TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICAN NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND STANDING UP FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE OF IOWA. SO GET YOUR FRIENDS, GET YOUR FAMILIES, GET YOUR NEIGHBORS, GET YOUR WORKERS AND CO-WORKERS AND GET THE OUT TO VOTE AS IF I DON'T GET IOWA I WON'T BELIEVE THAT ONE. I MAY NEVER HAVE TO COME BACK HERE AGAIN IF I DON'T GET IOWA. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT KIM? I WILL SAY THIS. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A PRESIDENT WHO IS DONE MORE FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS BREED THE FARM BELT FOR IOWA, THERE'S NEVER BEEN A PRESIDENT THAT IS EVEN COME CLOSE TO WHAT I'VE DONE AND I WILL SAY THAT AND I WILL SAY IT LOUD AND CLEAR. I WILL SAY THAT LOUD AND CLEAR. FROM CAMBRIDGE TO COUNCIL BLUFFS FROM CEDAR RAPIDS TO ROCK RAPIDS FROM DAVENPORT TO WRITE HERE IN DES MOINES WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF IOWA PATRIOTS WHO GAVE THEIR BLOOD SWEAT AND TIERS FOR THIS BELOVED NATION. WE INHERIT THE LEGACY OF AMERICAN HEROES AND NOBODY HAS ANYTHING MORE THAN YOU HAVE. LOOK AT YOURSELVES AND LOOK WHERE YOU HAVE COME. LOOK IN THE WORLD OF POLITICS. SO I WENT BY THE WAY AS LONG AS I'M HERE IOWA AND I MADE THIS PLEDGE TO YOU FOUR YEARS AGO, IOWA WILL ALWAYS COME FIRST IN THE NATION. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, RIGHT? THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE. LET'S PUT THEM BACK. WE ARE PUTTING THEM BACK DO YOU KNOW WHY? THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF CANCEL CULTURE. THAT'S CALLED A GREAT AMERICAN TRADITION. IOWA WILL ALWAYS BE NUMBER ONE. YOU CAN FORGET IT. WE INHERITED THE LEGACY OF AMERICAN HEROES ACROSS THE OCEAN BLAZED THE TRAILS SETTLED THE CONTINENT CAME THE WOMAN IS LAID DOWN THE ROW ROADS DUG OUT THE PANAMA CANAL RAISED UP THE SKYSCRAPERS WON TWO WORLD WARS DEFEATED FASCISM AND COMMUNISM AND LANDED OUR BRAVE AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS ON THE FACE OF THE MOON. SO MUCH YOU HAVE DONE. WE MADE AMERICA INTO THE SINGLE GREATEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND THE BEST IS YET TO COME.

         "Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, to all the members of the Security Council: I am here today, on behalf of the President of the United States of America, to discuss the ongoing crisis in Venezuela and to call on this body to stand up for democracy and the rule of law in that nation that has suffered so much. Article 24 of the U.N. Charter confers on this Security Council the 'responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.' As another American President said many years ago, 'The United Nations is designed to make possible lasting freedom and independence for all its members.' It is why this institution exists. For six long years, the people of Venezuela have suffered under the heavy hand of oppression. The Maduro regime's socialist policies have shrunk their economy by nearly half. In what was once one of the wealthiest countries in our hemisphere, 9 out of 10 people now live in poverty. The average Venezuelan has lost more than 20 pounds through deprivation and malnutrition. Thousands of Venezuelan children are starving. And at this very hour, infants in hospitals across Venezuela are dying for lack of basic medical care. And the Maduro regime, in the midst of this deprivation and suffering, has used violence and intimidation against anyone who opposes their actions. In the last three months, the regime has thrown at least 1,255 people into jail, without any due process of law, and killed at least 40 protestors. That's the nature of the regime that we're dealing with. But the Maduro regime is not only a threat to the Venezuelan people; it is a threat to peace and security of the wider region as well. The rising desperation in Venezuela has fueled a mass exodus, the likes of which we have never seen in the Western Hemisphere. More than 3 million Venezuelans have now abandoned their beloved country. And if things don't get better, it is estimated that another 2 million are expected to follow before the year is out. And traveling through the region, my wife and I witnessed the results of this deprivation firsthand. At a church in Manaus, Brazil, we spoke to families who had fled the deprivation in Venezuela. And I'll never forget when a father looked at me with his two young boys standing at his side and said how hard it was as a father to come home at the end of the day and say, 'We're not eating today.' And as he said it, his two little boys looked up and nodded, recalling those days. And then there was the day in Cartagena, Colombia, at another mission where Venezuelan people had fled the deprivation in their country. And a grandmother told me how it had gotten so bad in their small rural town, her grandchildren had had to rise at four in the morning to get a single ticket to purchase a piece of bread at four in the afternoon. The children were starving. And she gathered up her grandchildren and fled the country. Those are the stories the world deserves to hear of deprivation. And the truth is, those who stay behind are subject to crime, violence, and lawlessness. Thieves in Venezuela don't rob banks; they rob restaurants for food. Vicious gangs and so-called colectivos have turned the streets into warzones. And Venezuela now has the highest murder rate in the world, as more than 70 people are murdered every single day. Venezuela is a failed state, and as history teaches, failed states know no boundaries. Drug traffickers, criminal gangs, even terrorists like Hezbollah, are exploiting the chaos in Venezuela to gain a foothold in the region and export crime and violence. Were we to let the crisis continue, the chaos and suffering will only spread. The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy. Nicol�s Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power, and Nicol�s Maduro must go. But for all of the suffering of the Venezuelan people, across Venezuela, in cities large and small, people are rising up. They're rising up against their oppression and deprivation. Today, those courageous Venezuelans will take to the streets again. And as President Trump said not long ago, 'the fight for freedom has begun.' Just three short months ago, after Nicol�s Maduro was sworn into his second term stolen in a sham election, the National Assembly , the only duly elected body in Venezuela , exercised its power under the constitution and recognized a new leader: Interim President Juan Guaid�. And all across the Western Hemisphere, nations have been standing up to declare their support for President Guaid�. Last month, the Inter-American Development Bank voted to seat President Guaid�'s representative. Earlier this week, the G7 issued a statement saying the May 2018 presidential election lacked legitimacy and calling on the Maduro regime to, in their words, 'restore the authority of the National Assembly.' And just yesterday, the Organization of American States , the oldest regional organization in the world , voted to stand with the Venezuelan people and recognize the Guaid� government's representative as the only true representative of Venezuela. At President Trump's direction, the United States was proud to be the first nation to recognize Interim President Juan Guaid� as the legitimate President of Venezuela. And today, 54 nations have joined us. The Western Hemisphere has spoken with a clear voice. Nations across the world have spoken. It's time for the United Nations to speak. In February, the United States introduced a resolution to this Security Council that called for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela and for the Maduro regime to allow all humanitarian aid to enter the country. The resolution was not approved. Two nations which continue to back this brutal regime used their vetoes to stop this body from taking action. And while Russia and China continue to obstruct the Security Council, rogue states like Iran and Cuba are doing all they can to prop up the Maduro regime. For decades, Cuba has tried to create client states across our region. While normal countries export goods, Cuba exports tyranny and strong-arm tactics. Even now, Cuban military and intelligence services train and support and equip Venezuela's secret police as they silence opponents, jail and torture members of the opposition. Last week, the United States took action to sanction ships transporting Venezuelan oil to Cuba. And soon, at President Trump's direction, the United States will announce additional action to hold Cuba accountable for its malign influence in Venezuela. And this week, in addition to Cuba's action, Caracas received a delegation from Iran to begin direct air service between these two rogue capitals. This blacklisted airline is used to export terrorism by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which President Trump formally designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization on Monday. This is the company that Nicol�s Maduro keeps. And these nations continue to prop him up even as he inflicts suffering on the Venezuelan people. Just two months ago, the dictator in Caracas actually danced while his own citizens were shot and truckloads of desperately needed food and medicine burned. Unlike nations that are subsidizing the dictator in Caracas, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, the United States has been standing with the people of Venezuela, and we are committed to helping the families and communities that have been devastated by the Maduro regime. At this point, the United States has sanctioned more than 150 government officials and organizations loyal to the dictator. We've sanctioned state-owned businesses to prevent the Maduro regime from robbing the people of what is rightfully theirs. And as President Trump has said, we can be 'a lot tougher.' In addition, the United States has positioned more than 500 metric tons of food and humanitarian supplies on the Venezuelan border ready for immediate distribution. We've provided $200 million in aid to support displaced Venezuelans and the host communities that support them. And today, at President Trump's direction, the United States is announcing an additional $60 million in humanitarian assistance to address this crisis. The United States of America will continue to exert all diplomatic and economic pressure to bring about a peaceful transition to democracy in Venezuela. But all options are on the table. Up to this point, while other international bodies have acted, the United Nations and this Security Council have refused to act. But now that nations across this hemisphere have spoken, the time has come for the United Nations to recognize Interim President Juan Guaid� as the legitimate President of Venezuela and seat his representative in this body. This body should revoke the credentials of Venezuela's representative to the United Nations, recognize Interim President Juan Guaid�, and seat the representative of the free Venezuelan government in this body without delay. With all due respect, Mr. Ambassador, you shouldn't be here. You should return to Venezuela and tell Nicol�s Maduro that his time is up. It's time for him to go. Members of this Security Council: The men, women, and children in Venezuela are suffering. Their economy has been destroyed. Their democracy has been destroyed. The people of Venezuela are paying the price. And soon, the region and the world will pay the price if we fail to act. There can be no bystanders to this history. For the peace and security of our hemisphere, the world and the United Nations must stand with the people of Venezuela. To that end, the United States is preparing a resolution recognizing the legitimacy of the government of Interim President Juan Guaid�. And today, we urge every member of the Security Council and all U.N. member states to support this resolution. Stand with the Venezuela people as they rise up to restore freedom, democracy, and libertad to their nation. And this they are doing; they are rising up against intimidation and violence. Even today, the people of Venezuela are taking to the streets to march for freedom. Despite all the hardship, they continue to march. Despite all of the oppression, they continue to march. Despite the opposition, they continue to march with courage and strength because they're marching for freedom. And in the words of Sim�n Bolivar, 'A people that loves freedom will in the end be free.' But it's time for the United Nations to act and for the world to stand with the people of Venezuela as they march to freedom. History has taught us what happens when the civilized nations of the world allow oppression to go unchecked. When a brutal dictatorship arose in Europe, the world failed to respond. Millions of lives were lost in the Second World War. This very institution was forged in the aftermath of that war so that nations around the world could come together and confront dictatorship with one voice. And so the United States is calling on the United Nations to live up to its very purpose: Reject the failed leadership of Nicol�s Maduro, and stand with us, stand with nations across the world and across this hemisphere to help the people of Venezuela forge a brighter future. As President Trump has said, quote, 'If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.' So let us today rededicate ourselves to the mission upon which this body was founded: to maintain international peace and security. And we have confidence that if we do that, if we make every effort to be at peace, that the God of peace will guide us and bless us, today, tomorrow, and always. So thank you, Mr. President, for the honor of addressing you today. May God bless the people of Venezuela. And may God bless you all.",

         "THANK YOU, JOE. THANK YOU, JOE. AS I SAID WHEN YOU CALLED ME, I AM INCREDIBLY HONORED BY THIS RESPONSIBILITY AND I AM READY TO GET TO WORK. I AM READY TO GET TO WORK. AFTER THE MOST COMPETITIVE PRIMARY IN HISTORY, THE COUNTRY RECEIVED A RESOUNDING MESSAGE THAT JOE WAS THE PERSON TO LEAD US FORWARD, AND I AM SO PROUD TO STAND WITH YOU, AND I DO SO MINDFUL OF ALL OF THE HEROIC AND AMBITIOUS WOMEN BEFORE ME WHOSE SACRIFICE, DETERMINATION, AND RESILIENCE MAKES MY PRESENCE HERE TODAY EVEN POSSIBLE. THIS IS A MOMENT OF REAL CONSEQUENCE FOR AMERICA. EVERYTHING WE CARE ABOUT, OUR ECONOMY, OUR HEALTH, OUR CHILDREN, THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE LIVE IN, IT IS ALL ON THE LINE. WE ARE REALLY , REALLY , REELING FROM THE WORST PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN A CENTURY. AT THE PRESIDENT'S MISMANAGEMENT OF THE PANDEMIC HAS PLUNGED US INTO THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND WE ARE EXPERIENCING A MORAL RECKONING WITH RACISM AND SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE THAT HAS BROUGHT A NEW COALITION OF CONSCIENCE TO THE STREETS OF OUR COUNTRY DEMANDING CHANGE. AMERICA IS CRYING OUT FOR LEADERSHIP, YET WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO CARES MORE ABOUT HIMSELF THAN THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED HIM, A PRESIDENT WHO IS MAKING EVERY CHALLENGE WE FACE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO SOLVE, BUT HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS. WE DO NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FAILED GOVERNMENT OF DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE. IN JUST 83 DAYS, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO CHOOSE A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR COUNTRY. SO, JOE, DR. BIDEN, THANK YOU FOR THE TRUST YOU HAVE PLACED IN ME. JILL, I KNOW YOU WILL BE AN INCREDIBLE FIRST LADY, AND MY HUSBAND DOUG AND I ARE SO GRATEFUL, GRATEFUL TO BECOME A PART OF YOUR EXTENDED FAMILY. EVER SINCE I RECEIVED JO'S CALL, I HAVE BEEN THINKING, YES, ABOUT THE FIRST BIDEN I REALLY CAME TO KNOW, AND THAT OF COURSE IS JO'S BELOVED SON BEAU. IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT RECESSION, BEAU AND I SPOKE ON THE PHONE SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY WORKING TOGETHER TO WIN BACK BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR HOMEOWNERS FROM THE BIG BANKS OF THE NATION THAT WERE FORECLOSING ON PEOPLE'S HOMES, AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT BEAU BIDEN, I LEARNED QUICKLY THAT BEAU WAS THE KIND OF GUY WHO INSPIRED PEOPLE TO BE A BETTER VERSION OF THEMSELVES. HE REALLY WAS THE BEST OF US. WHEN I WOULD ASK HIM, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? HE WOULD ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HIS DAD. AND I WILL TELL YOU THE LOVE THAT THEY SHARED WAS INCREDIBLE TO WATCH. IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY OF THE LOVE BETWEEN A FATHER AND A SON. AND BEAU TALKED ABOUT HOW JOE WOULD SPEND EVERY DAY WRITING THE RAILS FROM WILMINGTON TO WASHINGTON, D.C. SO HE COULD MAKE BREAKFAST FOR HIS KIDS IN THE MORNING AND MAKE IT HOME IN TIME TO TUCK THEM IN BED EACH NIGHT. ALL OF THIS SO TWO LITTLE BOYS: I JUST LOST THEIR MOM AND SISTER IN A TRAGIC ACCIDENT WOULD KNOW THAT THE WORLD WAS STILL TURNING, AND THAT IS HOW I CAME TO KNOW JOE. HE IS SOMEONE WHOSE FIRST RESPONSE WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH IS NEVER TO THINK ABOUT HIMSELF, BUT TO CARE FOR EVERYONE ELSE. HE IS SOMEONE WHO NEVER ASKED, WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME, AND INSTEAD ASKS, WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR YOU? IS EMPATHY, HIS COMPUTER , HIS EMPATHY, AND HIS COMPASSION, AND HIS SENSE OF DUTY TO CARE FOR OTHERS IS WHY I AM SO PROUD TO BE ON THIS TICKET. JOE AND I, YES, WE ARE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH. I CANNOT WAIT FOR AMERICA TO GET TO KNOW MY HUSBAND DOUG AND OUR AMAZING KIDS, BECAUSE WHETHER I AM CHEERING IN THE BLEACHERS AT A SWIM MEET WERE SETTING UP A COLLEGE ROOM DOOR OR HELPING MY GODDAUGHTER PREPARE FOR MY SCHOOL , FOR HER SCHOOL DEBATE OR BUILDING LEGOS WITH MY GODSON OR HUGGING MY TWO BABY NIECES OR COOKING DINNER, SUNDAY DINNER, MY FAMILY MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME. I HAVE HAD A LOT OF TITLES OVER MY CAREER, AND CERTAINLY VICE PRESIDENT WILL BE GREAT, BUT MAMA WILL ALWAYS BE THE ONE THAT MEANS THE MOST. MY MOTHER AND FATHER, THEY CAME FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE WORLD TO ARRIVE IN AMERICA. ONE FROM INDIA, AND THE OTHER FROM JAMAICA IN SEARCH OF A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION, BUT WHAT BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER WAS THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT OF THE 1960'S, AND THAT IS HOW THEY MET, AS STUDENTS IN THE STREETS OF OAKLAND MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE AND A STRUGGLE THAT CONTINUES TODAY. I WAS PART OF IT. MY PARENTS WOULD BRING ME TO PROTESTS STRAPPED TIGHTLY IN MY STROLLER, AND MY MOTHER RAISED MY SISTER MAIA AND ME TO BELIEVE IT WAS UP TO US AND EVERY GENERATION OF AMERICANS TO KEEP ON MARCHING. SHE WOULD TELL US, DO NOT SIT AROUND AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THINGS, DO SOMETHING. SO I DID SOMETHING. I DEVOTED MY LIFE TO MAKING REAL THE WORDS CARVED IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. ADD 30 YEARS AGO, I STOOD BEFORE A JUDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREATHED DEEP AND UTTERED THE PHRASE THAT WOULD TRULY GUIDE MY CAREER AND THE REST OF MY CAREER, KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE, THAT IS WHO I HAVE REPRESENTED AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY FIGHTING ON BEHALF OF VICTIMS WHO NEEDED HELP, THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHO I VOTE FOR IS CALIFORNIA'S ATTORNEY GENERAL WHEN I TOOK ON TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAFFIC AND GUNS AND DRUGS AND HUMAN BEINGS. IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO LIFT HAVE FOUGHT FOR AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR, WHERE I HAVE WORKED EVERY DAY TO HOLD OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THE PEOPLE ARE WHO JOE AND I WILL FIGHT FOR EVERY DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. LET ME TELL YOU. AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS PRESENTED MY FAIR SHARE OF ARGUMENTS IN COURT, THE CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE IS OPEN AND SHUT. JUST LOOK AT THEY HAVE GOTTEN US. MORE THAN 16 MILLION OUT OF WORK , MILLIONS OF KIDS WHO CANNOT GO BACK TO SCHOOL, A CRISIS OF PROPERTY, HOMELESSNESS INFLICTING BLACK, BROWN AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF THE MOST. A CRISIS OF HUNGER INFLICTING ONE IN A FIVE MOTHERS WHO HAVE CHILDREN'S WHO ARE HUNGRY, AND TRAGICALLY, MORE THAN A 165,000 LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN CUT SHORT. MANY WITH LOVED ONES WHO NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE. IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. SIX YEARS AGO, WE HAD A DIFFERENT HEALTH CRISIS. IT WAS CALLED EBOLA, AND WE ALL REMEMBER THAT PANDEMIC. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THEN? BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN DID THEIR JOBS. ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES DIE, TWO. THAT IS WHAT IS CALLED LEADERSHIP. COMPARE THAT TO THE MOMENT WE FIND OURSELVES IN NOW, WHEN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE FOLLOWING THE SCIENCE, TRUMP PUSHED MIRACLE CURES TO SELL ON FOX NEWS. WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES WERE FLATTENING THE CURVES, HE SAID THE VIRUS WOULD JUST, PROOF , POOF, GO AWAY LIKE A MIRACLE. WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES OPEN BACK OF HER BUSINESS, WHAT DID WE DO? WE HAD TO SHUT DOWN AGAIN. THIS VIRUS HAS IMPACTED ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY, BUT THERE IS A REASON IT HAS HIT AMERICA WORSE THAN ANY OTHER ADVANCED NATION. IT IS BECAUSE OF TRUMPS , TRUMP'S FAILURE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY FROM THE START. HIS REFUSAL TO GET TESTING UP AND RUNNING, AND FLIP-FLOPPING ON SOCIAL DISTANCING AND WEARING MASKS. IT IS DELUSIONAL BELIEF THAT HE KNOWS BETTER THAN THE EXPERTS. ALL OF THAT IS REASON, THE RECENT THAT AN AMERICAN DIES OF COVID-19 EVERY 80 SECONDS. IT IS WHY COUNTLESS BUSINESSES HAVE HAD TO SHUT THEIR DOORS FOR GOOD. IT IS WHY THERE IS COMPLETE CHAOS OVER WHEN AND HOW TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS, MOTHERS AND FATHERS ARE CONFUSED AND UNCERTAIN AND ANGRY ABOUT CHILDCARE AND TO SAFETY OF THEIR KIDS AT SCHOOL, WHETHER THEY WILL BE IN DANGER IF THEY GO OR FALL BEHIND IF THEY DO NOT. TRUMP IS ALSO THE REASON IT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE NOW UNEMPLOYED. HE INHERITED THE LONGEST ECONOMIC EXPANSION IN HISTORY FROM BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN, AND THEN, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HE INHERITED, HE RAN IT STRAIGHT INTO THE GROUND. BECAUSE OF TRUMPS FAILURES , TRUMP'S FAILURES OF LEADERSHIP, OUR ECONOMY HAS TAKEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST HITS OUT OF ALL OF THE MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS WITH AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT HAS TRIPLED AS OF TODAY. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ELECT THE GUY WHO JUST IS NOT UP FOR THE JOB. OUR COUNTRY ENDS UP IN TATTERS, AND SO DOES OUR REPUTATION AROUND THE WORLD. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR. THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT DEFEATING DONALD TRUMP OR MIKE PENCE, IT IS ABOUT BUILDING THIS COUNTRY BACK BETTER. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT JOE AND I WILL DO. WE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH A CLEAN ENERGY RESOLUTION, BRING BRACK , BACK CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINS. BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO EVERYONE HAS THE PEACE OF MIND THAT COMES WITH HEALTH INSURANCE AND FINALLY OFFERED CAREGIVERS THE DIGNITY, THE RESPECT, AND THE PAY THEY DESERVE. WE WILL PROTECT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY, WROTE OUT SYSTEMIC , ROOT OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND PASS A JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ACT THAT WILL ENSURE EVERY VOICE IS HEARD AND EVERY VOICE IS COUNTED. THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE IS NOTHING NEW TO JOE. IT IS LIKE YOU GOT INTO PUBLIC SERVICE, WHY HE HELPED REAUTHORIZE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND RESTORE UNEMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAWS. HE TAKES HIS PLACE IN THE ONGOING STORY OF AMERICA'S MARCH TOWARD EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AS THE ONLY, AS THE ONLY WAY SERVED ALONGSIDE THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT AND HAS CHOSEN THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN AS HIS RUNNING MATE. BUT AS JOE ALWAYS POINTS OUT, THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT MORE THAN POLITICS. IT IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. I WILL ADMIT OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS WHERE I HAVE TRULY WORRIED ABOUT OUR FUTURE. WHENEVER I THINK THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR DOUBT, WHENEVER I HAVE HAD MY OWN DOUBTS, I THINK OF YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE DOCTORS AND NURSES AND FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO ARE RISKING YOUR LIVES TO SAVE OTHERS, THE TRUCK DRIVERS AND WORKERS IN GROCERY STORES, IN FACTORIES, FARMS WORKING THERE, PUTTING YOUR OWN SAFETY ON THE LINE TO UP US GET THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC, THE WOMEN AND STUDENTS TAKING TO THE STREETS IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS , THE DREAMERS AND IMMIGRANTS WHO KNOW THAT FAMILIES BELONG TOGETHER, THE LGBTQ AMERICANS WHO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS LOVE, PEOPLE OF EVERY AGE AND COLOR AND GREAT YOU FINALLY DECLARING IN ONE VOICE, BLACK LIVES MATTER . ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY , THIS COUNTRY, A NEW GENERATION OF CHILDREN IS HEARING UP , GROWING UP HEARING THE CRIES FOR JUSTICE AND CHANTS OF HOPE ON WHICH I WAS RAISED, SOME STRAPPED INTO STROLLERS OF THEIR OWN. IT IS A SONG YOU WILL NEVER FORGET. TO EVERYONE KEEPING UP THE FIGHT, YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING. YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING GREAT. YOU ARE THE HEROES OF OUR TIME, AND YOU ARE THE REASON. I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR COUNTRY CLOSER TO REALIZING IT'S GREAT PROMISE. TO DO IT, WE WILL NEED TO WORK, ORGANIZE AND VOTE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE NEED MORE THAN A VICTORY ON NOVEMBER 3. WE NEED A MANDATE THAT PROVES THE PAST FOUR YEARS ARE WHO WE ARE OR WHO WE ASPIRE TO BE. JOE LIKES TO SAY THAT CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT, AND IT IS TRUE. WHEN HE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE THREE YEARS AGO TODAY, Q KNEW WE WERE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. TOGETHER WITH YOUR HELP, IT IS A BATTLE WE WILL WIN. EARLIER THIS YEAR, I SAID I WOULD DO WHATEVER JOE ASKED ME TO DO. NOW I AM ASKING YOU TO DO THE SAME. VISIT JOB, JOEBIDEN.COM. ELECTING JOE BIDEN IS JUST THE START OF THE WORK AHEAD OF US. I COULD NOT BE PROUDER TO BE BUT DECIDED RUNNING TO REPRESENT YOU, THE PEOPLE. THANK YOU, AND MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.",

WE WERE PLANNING A BIG RALLY IN CLEVELAND TONIGHT, BUT THE GOVERNOR OF OHIO ASKED THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS TO CANCEL THEIR INDOOR PUBLIC EVENTS IN CLEVELAND, WHERE THERE ARE LARGE CROWDS OF PEOPLE, AND THAT IS WHAT WE DID, DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS. HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AS I SAID ALL ALONG, THAT WE WOULD FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF THE CDC, STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS WITH RESPECT TO OUR CAMPAIGN EVENTS WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. , THIS WHOLE CORONAVIRUS IS A MATTER OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. LATER THIS WEEK, I WILL BE SPEAKING TO YOU ON WHAT I BELIEVE THE NATION SHOULD BE DOING TO ADDRESS THIS VIRUS. TONIGHT I WENT TO SPEAK TO YOU FROM PHILADELPHIA, WHERE WE ANNOUNCED OUR CAMPAIGN AT THE FRONT END, WHERE WE DID OUR ANNOUNCEMENT. TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED OUT, LEFT BEHIND, THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. JUST OVER ONE WEEK AGO, MANY OF THE PUNDITS DECLARED THAT THIS CANDIDACY WAS DEAD. NOW WE ARE VERY MUCH ALIVE. WITH VICTORIES IN MISSISSIPPI, MISSOURI, MICHIGAN AND WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM IDAHO, NORTH DAKOTA AND WASHINGTON STATE. AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING, THIS ELECTION IS ONE THAT HAS CHARACTER ON THE BALLOT. THAT CHARACTER OF THE CANDIDATES AND OF THE NATION IS ON THE BALLOT. IT IS MORE THAN A COMEBACK IN MY VIEW, OUR CAMPAIGN, IT IS A COMEBACK FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. THIS CAMPAIGN IS TAKING OFF, AND I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO DO WELL FROM THIS POINT ON. TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED. I WANT TO EARN EVERY SINGLE VOTE IN EVERY SINGLE STATE, BUT IF YOU ARE WILLING, IF YOU WANT TO JOIN US, GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM. SIGN UP, VOLUNTEER AND CONTRIBUTE IF YOU CAN. WE NEED YOU. WE WANT YOU. THERE IS A PLACE IN OUR CAMPAIGN FOR EACH OF YOU. I WANT TO THANK BERNIE SANDERS AND HIS SUPPORTERS FOR THEIR TIRELESS ENERGY AND THEIR PASSION. WE SHARE A COMMON GOAL AND TOGETHER, WE WILL DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. WE WILL DEFEAT HIM TOGETHER. WE ARE GOING TO BRING THIS NATION TOGETHER. WE ARE REGENERATING A DEMOCRATIC BASE, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATED FOLKS LIKE THE ONES I GREW UP WITH IN CLAREMONT NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE, IN MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD, SUBURBAN WOMEN, VETERANS, FIREFIGHTERS, SO MANY MORE. PEOPLE OF EVERY ECONOMIC STATION. THE POOR WHO ARE STRUGGLING , AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT , THE MIDDLE CLASS, WHO WONDER WHETHER THERE WILL BE ABLE TO HANG ON AND MAINTAIN THEIR ECONOMIC SECURITY, THEY ARE THE REASON JILL AND I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS CAMPAIGN IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY ARE THE REASON WHY I BECAME A DEMOCRAT SO LONG AGO. I CAN'T TELL YOU, I MEAN THIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART , I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THE CONFIDENCE THEY HAVE SHOWN IN ME THUS FAR. THE WAY THEY TURNED OUT TO VOTE FOR ME. MY FIRST CAMPAIGN WHEN I WAS A KID, LONG TIME AGO, I HAD A BILLBOARD THAT SAID ONE THING ON IT. I HAD A PICTURE OF MY WIFE AND CHILDREN, AND IT SAID, 'FOR OF OUR FAMILIES.' THAT IS ALL IT WAS. 'FOR ALL OUR FAMILIES.' IT INCLUDED DEMOCRATIC FAMILIES, FAMILIES OF INDEPENDENT VOTERS, REPUBLICAN FAMILIES, EVERYONE OF EVERY STRIPE. FOR ALL OF OUR FAMILIES. AND LOOK, THAT IS WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN SOUTH CAROLINA, THAT IS WHAT WE DID ON SUPER TUESDAY, AND IT APPEARS, ALTHOUGH A LITTLE PREMATURE, IT APPEARS THAT IS WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO TONIGHT. IN JUST THE PAST WEEK, SO MANY OF MY INCREDIBLE COMPETITORS HAVE ENDORSED ME. MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, AMY KLOBUCHAR, BETO O'ROURKE MICHAEL , BLOOMBERG, CORY BOOKER AND KAMALA HARRIS. TOGETHER WE ARE BRINGING THIS PARTY TOGETHER. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. TONIGHT WE ARE ONE STEP CLOSER TO RESTORING DECENCY, DIGNITY AND HONOR TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT IS OUR ULTIMATE GOAL. AND AT THIS MOMENT, WITH SO MUCH FEAR IN THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE WORLD, WE NEED AMERICAN LEADERSHIP. WE NEED PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. THAT IS HONEST, TRUSTED, TRUTHFUL AND STEADY. REASSURING LEADERSHIP. IF I AM GIVEN THE HONOR OF BECOMING YOUR PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU I WILL STRIVE TO GIVE THE NATION THAT VERY LEADERSHIP EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY. THAT IS THE REASON WHY ARE YOU , THAT IS THE REASON WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I BELIEVE WE ARE IN AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY, A PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER A BOLD PROGRESSIVE VISION TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, GUARANTEEING THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS HEALTH CARE, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, TOTAL HEALTH CARE. NOT A PRIVILEGE, BUT A RIGHT. BUILDING ON OBAMACARE, PROVIDING EVERY CHILD ACCESS TO GOOD EDUCATION REGARDLESS OF THEIR ZIP CODE. TO DEAL WITH THE MORAL DEPRAVITY OF OUR CHILDREN WHO HAVE TO LEARN AT SCHOOL, LITTLE CHILDREN, TO DUCK AND COVER, ZIGZAG DOWN THE HALLWAY BECAUSE THEY FEAR SOMEONE WITH AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON MAY BE COMING IN. WE HAVE TO STAND UP TO THE GUN MANUFACTURERS AND THE NRA. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE HAVE TO ONCE AGAIN LEAD THE WORLD. DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA FIRST POLICIES MADE AMERICA ALONE. IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE, WE HAVE TO RALLY THE REST OF THE WORLD TO ACT AND ACT NOW. REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD ON DAY ONE, MAKE IT CLEAR TO OUR ALLIES THAT WE WILL HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS. THAT OUR WORD CAN BE TRUSTED. TONIGHT, I AM SPEAKING IN FRONT OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION CENTER, NOT FAR FROM WHERE TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN ALL OF HISTORY WERE WRITTEN, THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. 'WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT.' THOSE WORDS BECAME THE AMERICAN CREED KNOWN AROUND THE WORLD. THE U.S. CONSTITUTION. 'WE THE PEOPLE.' THESE WORDS LITERALLY CHANGED THE WORLD. WE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO THE PROMISE OF EITHER OF THOSE DOCUMENTS, BUT WE HAVE NEVER BEFORE WALKED AWAY FROM THEM. THEY ARE A REMINDER OF WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. OUR VERY DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. I SAID FROM THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCED NOT FAR FROM HERE THAT I BELIEVE WE ARE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. WHEN DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT, OUR CORE VALUES, OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD, OUR VERY DEMOCRACY, EVERYTHING THAT HAS MADE AMERICA AMERICA, IS TRULY AT STAKE. I BELIEVE THIS NATION CAN OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. BUT GIVEN EIGHT, FOUR MORE YEARS, COULD FOREVER AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. BUT WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA. NOT SOWING MORE DIVISION AND ANGER. IT MEANS HAVING A PRESIDENT THAT NOT ONLY KNOWS HOW TO FIGHT, BUT KNOWS HOW TO HEAL. IT MEANS REPLACING A PRESIDENT WHO DEMEANS AND DEMONIZES HIS PEOPLE WITH A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES IN EMPATHY AND COMPASSION AND RESPECT FOR EVERYONE. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE DAYS OF DIVISIVENESS WILL SOON BE OVER. WE ARE A DECENT, BRAVE, RESILIENT PEOPLE. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS MOMENT WE ARE IN. WE HAVE TO DO, WE JUST NEED TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. WE ARE CLOSE TO THE EVE OF ST.

Because their election will put an end to the block in Washington on the $2,000 in stimulus checks and that money will be going out the door. Think about what that will mean in your lives. Putting food on the table. Paying the rent. Paying the mortgage. Paying down the credit card. Paying the cell phone bill, the gas bill, the electric bill. Just look around. Millions of people in this country are out of work through no fault of their own. Struggling. Fearful. Giving up hope. Look at the lines at the food banks. They stretch for hours and hours. And they're getting longer. Families. Children. People who have worked their whole lives and have never asked for a thing except a fighting chance. Now they're now lining up for food in America. This debate over $2,000 isn't some abstract debate in Washington. This is about real lives. Your lives. The lives of good, hard-working Americans. And if you're like millions of Americans all over this country, you need the money. You need the help. And you need it now. Georgia, there is no one in America with more power to make it happen than you, the citizens of Georgia. If you send Jon and the Reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks are going out the door, restoring hope and decency and honor to so many people struggling right now. If you send Senators Perdue and Loeffler back to Washington, those checks will never get there. It's just that simple. The power is literally in your hands. By electing Jon and the Reverend, you can break the gridlock that has gripped Washington and this nation. With their votes in the Senate, we'll be able to make the progress we need to make on jobs and health care and justice and the environment and so many other things. By electing Jon and the Reverend, you'll be voting to get the states the resources they need to get the vaccines distributed. I've said it before. Getting America vaccinated will be one of the most difficult operational challenges this nation has ever faced. This Administration has gotten us off to a God-awful start. The states need more money to do the job. And they need a Federal Government that will work with them, not attack them or leave them hanging. It's going to be tough to get this done, but we have to do it. People's lives depend on it. Our economy depends on it. And we will get it done. By electing Jon and the Reverend, you'll be voting to get the state and local governments the money they need to keep their cops and firefighters and teachers and local responders, keeping them on the job, protecting you, and looking out for you and your children States have been struggling through this pandemic. They need the help. And by electing Jon and the Reverend, you'll be sending a powerful message to the Congress and the country: it's time for this nation to come together. To work together. To unite. To put the anger and the division and the divisive politics of the past behind us. And here's one more thing , voting for Jon and the Reverend won't just be good for America. It will be good for Georgia, and here's why. If you vote for Jon and Raphael you will be getting two Senators who will fight for you, who will put Georgia first, who will put you first. You don't have that now. You now have two Senators who think it's more important to reward wealth than hard work in the tax system. You have two Senators who think they work for Donald Trump, not you. You have two Senators who think their loyalty is to Donald Trump, not Georgia. You have two Senators who think they've sworn an oath of office to Donald Trump, not the United States Constitution. Well, let me tell you something. I was elected seven times to the United States Senate from Delaware. Not once did I take an oath to any President or anyone else. I took an oath to the United States Constitution. As president, I don't believe your United States Senators work for me. I believe they work for the people of Georgia. That's why I'm not asking your Senators to be loyal to me. I believe they should be loyal to you, to Georgia, and to the United States Constitution. And if you vote for Jon and the Reverend , that's what you will get. They won't put a president or party first. And they sure won't put themselves first. They know public service is about you. It isn't about enriching themselves. It's about making people's lives better. It's about giving people a chance, just an even shot. It's time we start rewarding work, not just wealth in this country. And if you listen to Jon and the Reverend, that's what they've been saying and that's what they've been campaigning on. On dealing with COVID. On revitalizing our economy. On health care. On voting rights. On criminal justice. On racial justice. On climate change. On the things that matter and that will make a difference in your lives. Georgia , as dark as these days of winter seem, I am still more optimistic about the future of this country than I have been my entire life. And Jon and Raphael share that optimism. Jon saw first-hand the power of believing in the promise of America even in our darkest moments from my old friend and yours , John Lewis. Reverend Warnock sees the power of faith to overcome the toughest trials that life can throw at us. He believes like I do in the quote by the philosopher Kierkegaard, who said, 'Faith sees best in the dark'. And I know they share with me a deep faith in the people of this country. A faith that enables us to overcome adversity, to lift each other up, to be a beacon of light for one another and to the world. That's who we are, and we should never give that up. I've said it many times, and I'll say it again here: There is nothing, nothing this country can't do if we do it together. I know these campaigns can be exhausting. You've put in the hard work over the last few years to get to this moment. It's been intense and nonstop. But I'm asking you to give everything you've got for one more day. One more day. And you can change America. So if you haven't voted, vote. And if you've already voted, then I'm asking for just one more day of making calls and safely knocking on doors. Go to to find your polling location. Just like you did in November, vote. Vote for both Jon and the Reverend. In America, as our opposition friends are finding out, all power flows from the people. That is our history. That is our law. That is our Constitution. That is democracy. Politicians cannot, assert, take, or seize power. Power has to be given, granted , by the American people. We can never give that up. It is always the will of the people that must prevail. So today, tomorrow, vote , make sure your voice is heard. Do it for yourselves. Your family. Your children. Your state. Your country. Do it for all those who have given so much to secure that right. Do it for the country you love. And the future you want to build. Do it for all those around the world who aspire to be like us to be a free, democratic people. That power is in your hands. Jon and Reverend Warnock are counting on you. So is Kamala. So am I. And so is America. We are a nation built on honor. Decency. Dignity. Respect. America is, and must continue to be a beacon of light, liberty, democracy, and unity. That's who we are. This is the United States of America. Vote, vote, vote. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops.",

         "On this holiest of Jewish religious observances, Melania and I send our warmest greetings to our Jewish brothers and sisters in America and around the world for a blessed Yom Kippur. Yom Kippur signals the end of the High Holy Days, a 10-day period of repentance filled with prayer, fasting, and fellowship, which concludes with the Day of Atonement. As the shofar bellows throughout communities this Yom Kippur, we are reminded of how important our faith has been over these past months as we continue to face the challenges posed by the coronavirus. Through the Almighty's love and the power of prayer, we have found renewed strength and understanding to face these unprecedented times with stalwart resolve. Today, as so many seek God's forgiveness and mercy, let us all resolve to incorporate these virtues of compassion into our daily lives. We wish all Jewish people an easy fast and a meaningful and memorable Sabbath of Sabbaths.",

         "THANK YOU. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW GREAT IT IS TO BE BACK IN SOUTH CAROLINA. GREAT TO BE WITH YOU ALL TONIGHT. ALL OF YOU. I HOPE YOU LOVE ME AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU. I HAVE BEEN COMING HERE A LONG TIME. WHEN I DIE, I HOPE TO BE BORN IN CHARLESTON. I LIKE THE LOW COUNTRY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I HOPE, THANK YOU, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. THANK YOU. I AM JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND, I WORK FOR CEDRIC RICHMOND. DAVID MACK IS TAKING ME TO SCHOOL. LOOK, I KNOW SOME OF THE OTHER SENATORS CAME TO SEE ME. THEY ARE IN SESSION RIGHT NOW. I THANK THEM FOR MAKING THE EFFORT. SO MANY PEOPLE HERE FOR ME TO SAY THANK YOU TO. I SPOKE TO OUR FOLKS UP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND THEY DID A GOOD JOB. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, THE PEOPLE OF NEVADA ARE WATCHING, AND I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, WE PRAISE THEIR DIVERSITY AS A STATE, AND I WILL BE OUT THERE SEEING THEM SOON. TONIGHT, THOUGH, WE JUST HEARD OF THE FIRST TWO OF 50 STATES. TWO OF THEM. NOT ALL THE NATION, NOT HALF THE NATION, NOT A QUARTER OF THE NATION, NOT 10%. TWO. NOW, WHERE I COME FROM THAT'S THE OPENING BELL, NOT THE CLOSING BELL, AND THE FIGHT TO END DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY IS JUST BEGINNING. JUST BEGINNING. THANK YOU. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IOWA HAS SPOKEN, BUT WE NEED TO HEAR FROM NEVADA, SOUTH CAROLINA, SUPER TUESDAY AND BEYOND. UP UNTIL NOW, WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THE MOST COMMITTED CONSTITUENTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY! AND THE FASTEST-GROWING SEGMENT OF SOCIETY, THE LATINO COMMUNITY! I WANT YOU ALL TO THINK OF A NUMBER. 99.9%, THAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS WHO HAVE NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE IN AMERICA. ONE MORE NUMBER. 99.8%, THE PERCENT OF LATINO VOTERS WHO HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE. SO WHEN YOU HEAR ALL THESE EXPERTS, CABLE TV TALKERS TALKING ABOUT THE RACE, TELL THEM IT AIN'T OVER, MAN, WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. OUR VOTES COUNT, TOO. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE TAKE THIS ELECTION AWAY. I'VE SAID IT A MILLION TIMES, YOU CAN'T BE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE AND CAN'T WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION WITHOUT OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FROM BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS. IT IS SIMPLE. IT'S A NATURAL FACT. IT IS TRUE, ABSOLUTELY TRUE. YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO WON AGAINST INCUMBENTS, FROM JIMMY CARTER TO A GUY NAMED CLINTON, A GUY NAMED OBAMA, MY GOOD FRIEND, GUESS WHAT? THEY HAD OVERWHELMING AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPPORT. WITHOUT IT, NOBODY'S EVER WON. REALLY. AND YOU ALL KNOW. MORE IMPORTANT, YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WIN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT WITHOUT BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS. TOO OFTEN YOUR LOYALTY AND SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT TO THIS PARTY HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED. I'VE NEVER ONCE IN MY CAREER TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED, AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD AS A BIDEN THAT I NEVER, EVER WILL. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT OTHER CANDIDATES WILL DO IN THE FUTURE, THE TENDENCY IS TO LOOK AT THE PAST. I LEFT A LAW FIRM WHEN I WAS A KID WITH A GREAT JOB, AT A FANCY LAW FIRM, TO BECOME A PUBLIC DEFENDER, TO FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY I USED TO WORK IN, ON THE EAST SIDE, BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD A LAWYER. ON THE COUNTY COUNSEL, I FOUGHT AGAINST REDLINING. IN THE U.S. SENATE, I PASSED AN EXTENSION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. AND I HAD THE BACK OF A GREAT PRESIDENT NAMED BARACK OBAMA FOR EIGHT YEARS. BY THE WAY, WE INCREASED ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT. GIVEN A CHANCE, THEY DO JUST AS WELL AS ANYONE ELSE, QUITE FRANKLY BETTER, AND THEY BUILT NEIGHBORHOODS, THEY BUILT COMMUNITIES! WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE FEDERAL POPULATION. SPEAKING OF HBCU'S , I GOT $70 BILLION COMING TO HBCU'S, NOT A JOKE. MINORITY UNIVERSITIES. WE SAVED THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, PASSED OBAMACARE, STOPPED INSURANCE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND ON TOP OF THAT, WE BUILT AN I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU NEED BEST. I LISTEN. YOU ALL KNOW WHAT YOU NEED BEST. WE DON'T LISTEN ENOUGH. WE TAKE FOR GRANTED. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED. WHAT YOUR FAMILIES NEED. WE NEED TO DEFEND AND BUILD ON OBAMACARE. TRUMP WON'S TO GET RID OF IT. EVEN SOME OF THE FOLKS IN MY OWN OUTFIT WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY. BUT I WILL NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN. I WAS PROUD TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VICE PRESIDENT. AND TO BECOME A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND. MY GRANDDAUGHTERS AND HIS DAUGHTERS ARE BEST BUDDIES. I WAS NEVER PROUDER THAN THE DAY WE PASSED OBAMACARE. WE WILL EXPAND THAT. WE WILL GET RID OF ALL THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT HAVE CURTAILED IT. WE WILL INCREASE FUNDING INTO RESEARCH FOR FINDING CURES. IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THERE IS A INCREDIBLE DISPARITY. IT IS SINFUL. IT IS AN INDICTMENT OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. EVERY CHILD HAS THE SAME CAPACITY WHEN THEY ARE BORN. EVERYONE OF THEM HAS THE SAME CAPACITY. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR ZIP CODE OR INCOME LEVEL. I WILL PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS. WE WILL GIVE TEACHERS THE PAYRAISE THEY NEED. WE ARE ALREADY SHORT. WHO WILL GET SHORTCHANGED? YOU'RE DARN RIGHT THEY ARE. WE WILL GIVE OUR TEACHERS A PAY RAISE. WE WILL AND ALL PRIVATE PRISONS. NO MORE JAIL TIME FOR ADDICTION. BUILD MORE TREATMENT FACILITIES. MAKE SURE MARIJUANA CONVICTIONS, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LEGALLY SAY, I HAVE NEVER BEEN ARRESTED. LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS. ALL OF THESE STATES ARE OUT THERE LEGALIZING MARIJUANA. WE SHOULD TAKE A BIG CHUNK OF THOSE PROFITS AND PUT AN END TO PRISONS. WE NEED TO BE A COUNTRY OF SECOND CHANCES. THINK ABOUT IT. WE ALL TALK ABOUT SECOND CHANCES. BUT WHAT DO WE DO? WE SAY YOU ARE DENIED ALL OF THE THINGS THAT CAN HELP YOU. WE WILL GIVE YOU $25 AND A BUS TICKET. WE NEED TO ELIMINATE ALL OF THOSE BARRIERS TO SUCCESS. PEOPLE COMING OUT OF PRISON AND COMING BACK FROM SERVING THEIR TIME, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET PELL GRANTS. HOUSING. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT GIVE THEM A CHANCE. WHILE THEY ARE THERE, WE SHOULD BE TEACHING THEM SKILLS. IT MAKES NO SENSE. WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY AND A GREAT PEOPLE. THE GREATEST WORKERS IN THE WORLD. WE SHOULD GET PAID LIKE WE ARE THE GREATEST WORKERS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE TOO MANY FAMILIES WORKING THEIR TAILS OFF. TOO MANY PEOPLE I KNOW DO WHAT MY DAD DID. WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT. PEOPLE ARE HAVING TROUBLE KEEPING THEIR ROOFS OVER THEIR HEADS. MY DAD LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, I PROMISE YOU, IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT. HE BELIEVED IT. TODAY, THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT LOOK AT THEIR KIDS AND SAY, WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. WE HAVE OVER 50% OF WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE WHO THINK THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER ACHIEVE THE SAME STANDING THEY HAVE. WHAT A GOD AWFUL THING. IT JUST MAKES ME MAD. WE ARE GOING TO INVEST IN OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. IN ROADS AND BRIDGES, BROADBAND, SCHOOL SYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE. WE WILL GET TO THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. I MAKE NO APOLOGIES. IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF EVERYBODY. THE WEALTHY, THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE WORKING CLASS. WHEN EVERYONE DOES BETTER, EVERYTHING WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES HAVE THE SAME CHANCE TO ACCUMULATE WEALTH. YOU LIVE IN A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU HAVE THE SAME WEIGHT , HOUSES THE GUY LIVING ACROSS THE NEIGHBORHOOD. YOURS IS VALUED LESS. YOU PAY MORE FOR INSURANCE. HOW DO YOU GET A CHANCE TO ACCUMULATE WEALTH? THAT IS NOT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FULFILL THE DREAMS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO INVEST IN TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY. THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY RAKED IN THEIR FAVOR. WE WILL INVESTED IN FAMILIES INSTEAD. I REALLY MEAN IT. I HAVE DONE IT. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT WE CAN GET DONE IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. FIRST, WE HAVE TO BE DONALD TRUMP. WHEN THOSE FOLKS CAME OUT IN CHARLOTTESVILLE CARRYING THOSE TORCHES, I NEVER WOULD'VE LEAPT IT. , BELIEVED IT. SCREECHING HATE. CARRYING NAZI BANNERS. CHANTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT WAS CHANTED IN THE STREETS OF GERMANY. THAT IS THAT THEY JILL AND I KNEW, AND MY GRANDCHILDREN KNEW, WE HAD NO CHANCE BUT TO RUN. I THOUGHT WE HAD FINALLY TURNED A CORNER. I HAD BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED ALL OF MY LIFE. BUT I LEARNED HATE DOES NOT GO AWAY. IT JUST HIDES. THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE NOTHING BUT BREATHE OXYGEN INTO THAT HATE. BRING IT OUT FROM UNDER THE ROCKS. AT HIS RALLIES, HE SPREADS THE MESSAGE OF PREJUDICE AND DIVISION. IN THE WHITE HOUSE, HE WELCOME AND SEND GUN MANUFACTURERS WHY , WHILE I KIDS ARE BEING GUNNED DOWN IN THE STREETS AND IN SCHOOLS. HE HAS 35 STATES SUPPRESSING THE BOAT, PRIMARILY TO KEEP PRODUCT , BLACK FOLKS AND BROWN FOLKS FROM VOTING. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. IT HAS TO STOP. I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE FIGHTING FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, SOCIAL JUSTICE. THIS DAY, 30 YEARS AGO, NELSON MANDELA WALKED OUT OF PRISON. I HAD THE GREAT HONOR OF MEETING HIM. HE WALKED IN. THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING I HAVE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE. HE SAID THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO COME AND SEE ME. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN CHAOS. BUT WHAT DID HE DO? HE IS A SAMPLE I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT. PEOPLE ASKED ME IF I WILL HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST TRUMP FOR GOING AFTER MY SON. IT IS NOT ABOUT ME AND MY SON. THAT MAKES ME ANGRY. PRESIDENTS CANNOT JUST FIGHT. THEY HAVE TO DEAL. WE HAVE TO DO IT WITH THE SAME KIND OF COURAGE AND CONVICTION. BY THE WAY, I AM NOT NELSON MANDELA. I AM NOT MAKING THAT COMPARISON. ALL OF YOU MINISTERS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT IS THE KIND OF CONVICTION WE NEED TO MOVE THIS NATION FORWARD. LORD, GIVE ME THE ABILITY TO CLIMB. TOGETHER WE WILL BE DONALD TRUMP. JEFF AND AND ANN SUPPORT OUR CAMPAIGN. LET'S GET TO WORK.

         "Well, thank you, Jim Bridenstine. Thank you for that kind introduction. And more to the point, thank you for your tireless work leading NASA and the entire American space industry. Would you all join me in thanking the 13th Administrator of NASA, Jim Bridenstine, for the great job he's doing? (Applause.) To Secretary Wilbur Ross, Chairman Moran, Senator Cramer, Congressman Lucas, Congresswoman Horn, Congressman Babin and members of the House Science Committee , to all the members of Congress who are with us here today, thank you for supporting a renewed American leadership in space. Join me in thanking all these great members of the House and Senate. (Applause.) And to all of you leaders in industry, the archivists , all of you that have made this evening possible , especially the extraordinary filmmakers who I know we'll see their handiwork in just a few minutes , it really is an honor to be here today. The world premiere of Apollo 11: First Steps Edition. Welcome all. It is great to be with you. (Applause.) And let me say, as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a man who is committed to securing American leadership on Earth and in the boundless expanse of space, whose vision has enlivened America's commitment to human space exploration. I bring greetings and gratitude to all of you from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And I always wait to introduce the highest-ranking official last. So join me in welcoming an aviator, an educator, a Marine Corps mom, and my wife of 33 years , the Second Lady of the United States of America, Karen Pence. (Applause.) You know, Karen and I are , we're pretty passionate about space. In fact, when our kids were very young , and they're all in their twenties right now; one is in the military, two are still in graduate school , we actually , we actually vacationed at Cape Canaveral, just so we could take the kids to see the rockets. So we're honored to be with all of you today in this incredible and historic place. Speaking of which, allow me to thank our host tonight. You already heard from her, but Dr. Ellen Stofan and all the wonderful, dedicated men and women at the National Air and Space Museum. This is the most popular museum in the United States and one of the most popular museums in the world. Thank you, Dr. Stofan. Thank you for your great leadership and stewardship of this national treasure. (Applause.) It really is amazing to be here, standing here before you , the 'Spirit of St. Louis' just above us, that made that transatlantic flight. And then there's 'Glamorous Glennis' just above us, that broke the sound barrier. And then this lunar module behind me. It's amazing to think, just in my lifetime, how far America has come. And here at this great museum, we preserve that legacy. But as I just told Dr. Stofan, thanks to President Trump's leadership, they're going to have to build a new wing because we're going to make all new American history in the vast expanse of space. (Applause.) Not that it should be a surprise. In his Inaugural Address to the nation two years ago, President Trump said that America stands, in his words, 'at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space.' What the President recognized, what you all recognize is America has always been a nation of restless pioneers , ever striving to explore uncharted territories, reach new horizons, venture into the unknown, and expand the boundaries of human knowledge. But it was in 1961 when another President, John F. Kennedy, laid out a vision for American human space exploration. He expressed those immortal words, laying forth a goal for the nation, that, quote, 'before this decade is out landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.' It was anything but easy. Literally hundreds of thousands of engineers, scientists, technicians worked around the clock to make it possible , planning each detail and preparing every possibility. And just 8 years later , 50 years ago this July , Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins made it happen and proved that the United States can do anything we put our mind to, when we put the first man on the moon. (Applause.) And tonight, we're going to see some never-before-seen footage of those incredible moments , and I can't wait , including when that 'one small step' for a man became 'one giant leap for mankind.' The crew of Apollo 11 inspired a generation of Americans and people all over the world. They are giants on whose shoulders we stand , paving our way into the heavens and giving us the courage to dream bigger, to go farther, with the confidence that we can accomplish whatever we set our minds to. So as we prepare to mark this golden anniversary of their mission later this year, we honor their legacy , the legacy of Apollo 11 , by celebrating it in moments like this. And there will be many celebrations over the course of the year. But I submit to you that we believe we also honor their legacy by renewing our commitment to American leadership in space. (Applause.) As President Trump said, 'It is America's destiny to be the leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown.' And over the past two years, I'm pleased to report to you that we've begun writing the next chapter of that adventure with ingenuity and incredible Americans all across this nation. In our first year, after it had lain dormant for nearly a quarter of a century, I'm proud to say that President Trump kept his word to the American people back in 2016, and he revived the National Space Council to coordinate all space activities across a whole-of-government approach. And it's my great honor to serve as Chairman, as previous Vice Presidents have done. We also looked beyond the halls of government for input and guidance, partnering with businesses represented here so well to accelerate innovation across the space enterprise. And we're honored to be joined this evening by several members of what we call our 'User Advisory Group.' We thought it was imperative that we brought together the best and brightest men and women in the nation with expertise in the space enterprise. And these men and women have gathered from some of the most incredible companies in this country to bring their expertise. And they join us here today , members of the User Advisory Group. Would you join me in giving a round of applause for all the members of the UAG? (Applause.) I got Dr. Mary Lynne Dittmar, the President of the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration; Dr. Bud Peterson, the President of Georgia Institute of Technology; and Eric Stallmer, the President of Commercial Space Federation; and Mandy Vox , President of VOX Space. Give them all a round of applause because they're helping to guide renewed American leadership in space. (Applause.) And while we're at it, I couldn't help , I couldn't help but take the opportunity to invite you to recognize some extraordinary people who are with us today. One was a veteran , one was a veteran of three different space shuttle missions. She's now the Director of the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Join me in welcoming Astronaut Janet Kavandi, who is with us today. Janet, thank you. (Applause.) We're also joined by a member of that User Advisory Group, who is currently serving as the Director of Space and Technology at Nova Systems. Was the commander of Space Shuttle flights STS-120. Colonel Pamela Melroy, where are you? Astronaut and Colonel Pamela Melroy. (Applause.) And finally, let me recognize a member of the crew of the final mission of the Space Shuttle. She's spent more than 144 days in orbit, and she is an incredible testament to the American Astronaut Corps. Astronaut Sandy Magnus is with us here today. Sandy, thank you. (Applause.) I've got to tell you the progress we've made. In December of 2017, as a result of the work of the National Space Council, President Trump signed Space Policy Directive-1, where we made it the policy of the United States of America to return to the moon with the goal of one day putting Americans on Mars. (Applause.) And I'm proud to report we're on track. This year, the United States will once again send American astronauts into space on American rockets, from American soil. (Applause.) Just two months ago, during a meeting of the National Space Council down at 'Rocket City,' in Huntsville, Alabama, it was also my privilege to announce what Jim Bridenstine just reflected on: that, at President Trump's direction, it is the policy of the United States that we will return to the moon within the next five years, and the first woman and the next man on the moon will be an American. (Applause.) So we've made great strides in advancing the President's bold new vision for American leadership in space , to push us farther and faster and higher than ever before. And unlike in years past, we have the budgets to match. As Administrator Bridenstine just said, we just sent to Capitol Hill a budget request to put , would put real substance behind the President's vision. And I want to thank these members of Congress for their stalwart support. Well, as I started to come up here, Karen and I were chatting, and she reminded me that you all didn't come here to hear me; you came here to see a movie. (Laughter.) So I want to get out of your way and let you enjoy that. But it's impossible to come to a moment like this, an evening like this, and not be incredibly inspired. And I want to thank the National Air and Space Museum again for your hospitality. I want to thank Administrator Bridenstine for the great work he's doing at NASA. And I want to thank all of you for the enthusiasm that all of you are showing. Everywhere I go in this country, people are getting it again. People understand that America has made great history leading human exploration in space. But with your support, with President Trump's leadership, with the strong support of these outstanding members of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, with the courage of a new generation of astronauts, and with God's help, I know America will once again astound the world with how we lead in space. So thank you very much. God bless you. And enjoy the movie. (Applause.)",

So under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded. 33.1% fastest ever recorded Way created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months. That's a record. And while foreign nations are in freefall, we are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they're better off today than they were four years ago. That's under the auspices of Barack Hussein Obama on a sleepy Joe Biden. You're not gonna wanna have Joe Biden. You know, if we had see the media, look at all the media back there, if we had, if they had to cover, if they had to cover him for two months, let's say we have to bring the president back. We have to bring. We have to bring Trump back. They would be out of business. They would be out of business that Biden, Harris and the radical Left gain power. They will collapse our economy and send your nation this wonderful nation into a depression that was, you know they want. It is the only guy I have ever seen who runs by saying we will. He doesn't say it like that. He goes, who you way will raise your taxes. I never heard that before. You know, I've covered politicians. I've been friends of politicians. I've been enemies also, but I've never seen somebody saying we will raise your taxes. They want to give you the largest tax increase in the history of our country. And we can't let we can't let that happen. So get out and vote tomorrow. It's the biggest. Tomorrow will be, I think will be the most important election in the history of our country. And I never thought I'd say that. I never thought I'd say so. Get out and vote. Sleepy. Joe Biden will raise your taxes. $4 trillion massively increase your regulations. Shut down your farms. Closed down your factories. How is he doing so far? Send your jobs overseas. They start booing him. I don't know. Is this guy really thinking about? I mean, could he really win? Are we serious about this? No, I didn't. Thanks. What the hell is going on to see? Serious guy has no clue. He shot some people Have shot. He's shot. Did you see him today with the the Aviators? Right. The glasses. Right. Came on. Very tough. He's very agitated, you know, It's like sort of like going crazy, I think. Destroy the suburbs, dissolve your borders, terminate religious liberty, outlaw private healthcare. Confiscate your gun. Second Amendment is a deep trouble. Not with me. It's not. Hasn't you notice it hasn't been touched right? It hasn't been touched. You think that was easy? It wasn't easy and indoctrinate your Children with anti American lies. So I just signed an executive order to teach our students pro American values her, oh, American values. Biden is vowed to abolish the American oil and natural gas industries and ban fracking. Now, from your standpoint, you don't like it because you don't want energy costs going up right. That's what he dio. Biden's energy band will send every state into crushing poverty from Wisconsin to Michigan. Nevada, Pennsylvania, as long as I am president will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. We are right and we will remain energy independent. You know, we're energy independent. We don't need foreign nations anymore. But we have good relationships in the Middle East. You know, we're we're doing peace in the Middle East. You believe it? No blood in the sand. Peace in the Middle East. Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure on foreign wars. You know, they call them the endless foreign wars. Countries that many of you have never heard about. What? What? Uh, yeah, E. Yeah. I don't know. I think we're doing fine with this Mike, right? I don't want to put this guy under pressure. You're on stage. You got 27,000 people watching you. Don't get nervous. No, he's not nervous. He's a professional. I'll give you the name of his company. Never used that company now. No, it's fine. Don't worry about it. This is okay. This isn't bad. Do you want toe? Oh, you want to just put it in there? Well, that is it. The same. Micah's the other one. It's a different mike. That means that was supposed to be better, right? That's not good. All right. Okay. We'll take that sucker out of there. Right. Congratulations. Yeah. How is he doing? He's doing a good job. Come on. Mhm. Now we're back where we started. See? The whole deal? We're right back where we started. I take the mic out. Okay? Okay. You know what? And then I won't pay the bill of the, you know, company that this is crazy microphone and they'll do a story. Trump is Ah, horrible human being. He doesn't pay a bill. No, I don't like to pay bills When people do a bad job, you don't either. But I don't know. They look like nice people. They come from Kenosha. So I'm gonna pay the bill anyway. What the hell? You know, At least I prove one thing, You know, Did you ever see where I lifted last of water? And I wear the red tie of this sort of expensive And, you know, you don't like to spill water on the red tie, right? So sometimes I'll use two hands and because I want to catch the water because I want to save the time because I'm basically cheap, you know? So I'll take the water to go like this. I'll take a little sip and they'll say, there's something wrong with him. There's something they said, No, I'm trying to save. So I got like this. So now, by holding a mic all night long like this, you're gonna say, Well, there's nothing wrong with that right hand or left hand. Now, did you ever hear that there's something wrong? You can't lift a glass of water and I have no problem with that someday. I may like Joe, but I don't have any problems. Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Wisconsin lost half of your manufacturer. Think of it. You lost half of your manufacturing jobs after the betrayals. These were betrayals by a lot of people, and Biden was one of them. He's a corrupt politician, and he sold out Wisconsin to China. But he's a corrupt politician, and these people never told you that. And they don't want to write about it. And big Tech doesn't want to talk about it. And it's off bounds and they're not allowed to talk. And we have suppression. We have suppression. This is a media suppression, the likes of which nobody has ever seen. And if you take a look, you've never seen anything like it. Yeah, the last famous last words, right? But no, nobody's ever seen anything like it. You know. His son walks in. His son had no job. He left the military. Unfortunately, it wasn't good. And then what happens is the father becomes vice president on this kid becomes like a human vacuum cleaner. He follows the father into countries dead. Who are you going to today? Well, let's go to China. And he's a vacuum cleaner. Follows. The father takes in money, right? It's terrible. They give him $1.5 billion.1.5 billion one. And I think of it $1.5 billion. And he gets fees off that millions of dollars a year. There's only one problem. He has no experience investing money. They give him the money. They gave him the money after 10 minutes. I think our Congress has to take a look at that. What do you think, fellas? I think you're gonna have to look at it. Can you imagine? You don't have a lot of my kids here tonight. Can you imagine if my kids said your dad? I got a billion and a half dollars from China. Oh, I don't think they want to write about that. The fake news. Do you think they'd right about that? Then he gets $3.5 million from the mayor of Moscow's wife. Right? What did he get that for? Remember I asked that at the debate. The first debate. I said it Chris Wallace thought it was an inappropriate question. Really? I think you think Chris Wallace? No. I must tell you, I think Kristen did a better job. Kristen Welker, right? I don't mean she was perfect. Actually. Some people said she wasn't really very nice. I thought she was nice. Relatively speaking. She was great for what I get. How about the one Savannah Guthrie? You see that one? That was that was another beautiful live at nine o'clock. She's jumping out of a chair. She's like going crazy. But we all do. Well, you know, I don't get questions like he gets. He gets, sir. What kind of ice cream are you? Did you see that? They never asked me questions like that in 2016. Wisconsin voted to fire this, corrupt it. And really, it's like corrupt, corrupt political establishment, right? And you elected an outsider is president who is finally putting America first, finally putting America on. If I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician, right? If I don't always play by the rules of the Washington establishment is because I was elected to fight for you and nobody has ever fought harder for you than I am. I will tell you noy I when the violent mob came to Kenosha Biden oppose sending in the National Guard. Of course You remember this, right? He didn't. He didn't want to send in the guard. He thought it was terrible. Descend in the guard and we sent in the guard and we saved Kenosha. We saved those. I said, You know, I think Kenosha is gonna like May. We did a good job. I wish they sent him in a little bit earlier, right? If we hadn't been a little bit earlier, But that's okay. That's okay, But we sent in and how How good did the guard do, though? Did we do the job? Did they dio Biden and Kamala? Does anybody know who Kamala is? That's this wonderful woman. She wants to be your first female president? I don't think so. I don't think so. You know, that's a good reason not to vote for Sleepy Joe to right. You don't want to do that. You wanna have? We all want to see that happen someday. But we don't want this to be the one right, But they're waging war in our police. You know that your police with you, we have a lot of police here tonight. I recognize that because because I went and I met all of the police. I met a lot of great police, federal police. I met the whole group. And you have great police. I agree with that. But I stand with the heroes of law enforcement, and I was honored to be endorsed by Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth. Thank you, David. Wherever you may be. Thank you, David. That was so nice. That was so nice. They like you out there. David. That's very good. Appreciate it, David. Thank you very much. And as I'm sure you've heard, Biden's far left supporters are threatening to loot and riot tomorrow If they don't get their way. They don't get their way already. David. Everybody ready it, Z if they know we're ready, and if they know we're not playing games, they won't even be here. They won't show up, you know, it's like I brought an old law into existence when I saw them going around all over the country knocking down statues, right and monuments and we signed. We brought it in and I signed it updated and signed it. 10 years in prison. If you're knocked down a statue or monument on, you don't see it anymore. They look and they say, Oh would like to knock that one down. But you know what? 10 years is too much. Darling, Let's leave now. This is yet more evidence why the radical left cannot be trusted with power. We strongly condemn political violence. We condemn it and we condemn it strongly. Biden must tell his supporters he doesn't really have supporters. Let's face it, he doesn't have supporters. The guy shot, he doesn't have. There's There's an ideology that has supporters, and he's just a vessel, you know, He happened to be the one that got through because Elizabeth Warren, instead of getting out like she should have and letting Bernie take it. Bernie, I got to tell you, he is a great loser. He really is. He loses. It happened with Hillary, and it happened with Elizabeth Warren. What she did was incredible, you know, that's a similar philosophy, but Biden ended up being there. Biden end up being there, and that's the way it is that he has to tell his supporters. And I think you're going to see something. Look at the people over Here they go. Hello? Can you actually hear this? Can you hear this thing? Because it is the worst microphone I've ever used in my life. Can you actually hear me over there? They can in the back, all the way back. That's good. Thank you. I can't believe it. It sounds terrible to me. His silence is that it doesn't sound great right to me. It doesn't sound right. It's all right. Good. You know what? Keep saying it. That Bill, he just don't pay him. Don't pay him. You hear that, Johnny? Don't pay the damn bill, will you please? A piece of garbage they gave him. It's not even the first rate back. The one the good one is. It's put to rest. We put it to rest. The good one. We put the rest, all right. Don't pay him. But as president, I will ensure peace and order in this country. We're going to have peace and order, and you're gonna have a day tomorrow. The likes of which I think people haven't seen in a long time. A long time you're gonna have a red way is gonna be a beautiful sight. And you know what we have a lot of we have. We actually have a country that outside of a radical group, and this is a radical group, but we have a country that's very well united. When you look at a group of people like this, it's incredible. And I go from here I go. I told you, Grand Rapids, we have. They say they have 40 50,000 people in Grand Rapids last night in Florida. We have 45,000 people. No problem. Everybody's in love. Everybody loves our country. It's a beautiful thing. I'm telling you this there's a lot of unity. We just don't complain, you know, we don't complain. We just go out and do what we have to do. But, you know, when we were having that incredible run, we were doing the best. And now we're almost at that same point. It will be there soon, but our country was uniting. We were getting calls. We had the best employment numbers ever. African American, Asian American, Hispanic, American. And we were getting calls like Maybe it's time we get together, you know, because success brings people together. Success brings people together. And you're going to see that happening because we're having numbers the likes of which we've never had before. 33. Think of a 33.1% nobody's ever had that the highest was 1952 and it was less than half of that number. So rioting, looting and arson will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I'm just telling you that right now, I'm telling you that right now that if people are you know, I hate to see where they put boards up on a window. This shouldn't be that it shouldn't be that. But we are going. We are a country of law and order. We have to pay, we are and people and you notice. I hate to say it, but it's true. This is a these Air Democrat. Mayors and governors. He's a Democrat. Run cities and states. They're the ones. If you look at New York and Chicago and how about Portland, which is anarchist? We could solve that problem. We tell the governor you want us to solve the problem. We solve it in 30 minutes. We solved it in Seattle. We went in. We were going to go in the morning. We announced we're going in in the morning and they just raised their hands and they left the night before. Then we did a great job in, uh, you know, Minneapolis. We did a great job. We're gonna win Minnesota for two reasons. We did a great job now. They could have called. They could have let us do it a week and a half. Fairly. That would have been nice, you know? Right. So that the announcer remember the anchor you looked over says this is a peaceful protest. Yeah. Thank you. What a group. What a group. What a group. I've gotten to know this state very well. You know? You surprised, You know, you're the one that put us over the top. You know that, right? Remember way were waiting for Pennsylvania four years ago. We're waiting for Pennsylvania. They didn't want to call it. Oh, they were going crazy. These people, they were crying. They didn't know what the hell was happening. They said this will be a very short evening for Donald Trump. Four years ago, right? and they were just like, Oh, they were looking for would remember the woman crying in the convention center that beautiful Remember the woman? He was going crazy glasses, heads God, she was She's. I wonder where she is right now. She's They put her away. No, no, This was not a person that I was easily going to convince to be on my side. I think two is going crazy. But remember the beginning. They should. Everyone's happy. Everyone's thrilled. They spent a fortune. It was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. In terms of the stage, they had a shape like the United States. Hello back there. You okay? But that was a hell of an evening. And this evening is going to be a I'm telling you tomorrow it's going to be I can't say bigger. There was. Was there ever anything is big? I'll tell you, the election is more important, but the evening will be as good or almost a good. And that's okay too. But that was the first right? That was the first. That was some of the things that was some evening. He won Florida. He won Ohio. He won it all. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. On because of the microphone, we are giving you back half of your admission price. But considering that you paid nothing, I'm sorry. You're getting nothing. The price is right. No, it's fine. But, you know, But wasn't that something, though? Where they say that the evening begins and they say this is gonna be very quick. You know what happened? They did exit polls, and a lot of the people said none of your business. So who did you vote for? None of your business. That meant Trump. And they did 44%. You know that 44% of the people said none of your business, and that meant chop. They call it the none of your business vote, but almost all of them. I think maybe all of them were trump, so they didn't count them. So they said, Oh, this is gonna be a blowout tonight. But they didn't realize. You know, these pollsters haven't been doing so good with May, and we blew it out. It was incredible. It started with Ohio. Remember? We're gonna do great in Ohio tomorrow too. By the way, great place Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. That's a big state. You know, I heard for a year when we're doing this, you cannot win unless you win the state of Ohio every night. They did it. And then all of a sudden, poll numbers started coming out that I was leading, you know, But anyway, but they thought I was gonna win by one point. I won by eight. They said he won Ohio. He won by eight points. What the hell is going on here? That's a lot. And then they said, Oh, no! Oh, no. Please don't tell me this. Donald Thas won the state of Florida. No, no, no. Well, please, Please, please, Please remember Martha Raddatz, ABC? Oh, my God. Please, Please don't tell me this. Oh, no, I'm a neutral. I'm very neutral. I don't. Please, Martha. Neutral, please. The tears. Wiping them away quickly. No. Then we won Florida. Then we won Georgia. Then we went South Carolina. Then we won. The firewall was remembered. North Carolina. That's the firewall. We're gonna win North Carolina. They have They put so much money into North Carolina. But we had an asset from North Carolina named Lara. Laura Lara Trump married to married to the legendary Eric Trump. Where are you? Are you two there? Way had a We had a big asset there, Laura Jumping. She knew that area so well. And they loved her so much. They loved her so much. And they just had another baby. And they named the Baby Carolina. They named the Baby Carolina. And I tell you, though, but I said we have to give South Carolina some credit, too. For that. Bring them up. Come on up! Get over! Come on, Bring them up. Bring them up! Great. Come on. Come on, Laura. This one, They love her. And North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania. And they lover in Wisconsin to here you go. Thank you very much. Thank you, honey. Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Winner. They're doing a good job. They're working hard. I'll tell you, they're all working hard. They're all working hard. We have a whole group of families, like a family reunion tonight. Now, well, you know, this is now the big time, because tomorrow is the big day and we have one more stop to actually, you know, I did five today, but I could say I could say I did six. Because in Miami, we finished it close to two o'clock in the morning. So let's added six today. Okay? After Grand Rapids, Joe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media and powerful special interests. You know that they own him. They control him, and they know he will always do their bidding. And when he raises $300 million for this campaign in a short period of time, ask him. What deals did you have to make? Because I would be the greatest fundraiser of all time. I can call the Wall Street guys. I know him. All I could say, Send me $25 million immediately, please. Yes, sir. Mr President, I will. But you know, once you do that, you're totally compromised. You can't do anything properly once you do that. And I say, I don't want to do that. And we did very well with the fundraising stuff, but a lot of it came in small donations. First time a Republican has ever raised a lot of money with small donations, like $61 average or something like that. Every corrupt force in American life has betrayed you and hurt you. And they're all supported by Joe Biden, the failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars. They're supported by Sleepy Joe Biden, the career politicians that offshored your industries and you had plenty offshored and decimated your factories. They support Joe Biden, the open borders lobbyists, all the people that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs, gangs and crime. And you know a lot about that. They support Joe Biden, the anti American radicals defaming our noble history, heritage and heroes. They support Joe Biden. That's cancel culture. We don't believe in cancel culture Dio antifa and the riders and looters and Marxist and left wing extremists. They all support Joe Biden. This election comes down to a simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the corrupt and selfish political clor do you want to be governed by the American people? It's what it's all about the American people. They've taken that away. They've taken it away. And what's going on with big tech and what's going on with the media is nobody has ever seen anything like it. There's never been anything like it. Nobody has seen anything like it where you know you can't have a you can't have. You can't have a scandal if there's nothing written about, it is pretty tough. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalist and communists and socialists and wealthy liberal hypocrites hypocrites who want a silent sensor cancel and punish you. These are riel really trouble if you want your Children to be safe, if you want your values to be respected, if you want your If you wanna be just treated with dignity and respect, then I am asking you tomorrow to go out. Vote for your all time favorite president way. Still have work, Thio. Thank you. Thank you. Remember what I said four years ago? I am your voice and we will all together make America great again. That's what we're doing. That's what we've done for the last four years. The depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me. Can you imagine if they didn't do the hoax? The Russia Russia hooks, right? Russia, Russia, Russia. How about shift getting up the other day? The laptop from hell, Right? That's Where's Hunter? Where's hunters out there? Where's Hunter? Oh, he's in a country. I say. His father just left. The country is going to scam them for a couple of bucks. Where is Hunter? Nobody's got the laptop from hell and shift Got up with the watermelon head, right? Like a watermelon. And he goes, This was produced by Russia. These people are crazy, I tell you. Hey, what a crazy bunch! But they know I don't answer to them. My answer to you It's true. I Look, I didn't need this. I didn't need this. I had a very nice life. I had a very nice life. But you know what? It's the greatest thing I ever did because no administration, no president. In the 1st 3.5 years, the biggest tax cut in history, the biggest regulation cuts rebuilding our military. Look at what we've done. Look at what we've done. Our vets just gave a 91% approval rating, the highest in history, the highest in history. Now look at what we have done. Space Force. I never even talked about space for us. I never talked. I realized we needed it. After I was in office, I looked. I saw I saw Rush. I saw China. I said, We need space for first time in 74 years. New one. Write a new one. Right, Congressman, we did. We did a great job on it. Together we will defeat the corrupt establishment. We will dethrone the failed political class. We will drain the Washington Swamp and we will save the American dream. A dream for your Children, your grandchildren, right. A dream for your Children and your grandchildren. We have the energy and the people to prove the corrupt media wrong. And that's what we have. We have an energy like no movement has ever had in this country. You know, uh, somebody would go in and do well in New Hampshire is an example. I'm thinking about one because I have a lot of respect for him. He did well, came in second in the primary, and he became famous for many years. What we did is we want all the primaries. We won everything and then we won the presidency. No, there's never been a movement like this, and now they go after us illegally. They spied on our campaign. Our campaign is not my our campaign. They tried Thio take out a duly elected president of the United States and we caught them and we caught them and let's see what happens to them. And you know who is a part of it. Barack Hussein, Obama and Sleepy Joe Budden and plenty of others like Comey, etcetera but plenty of others. But they were a part of it. So now we'll see what happens, right? We're going to see we're going to see what happens. So but you have to get out and vote is the biggest thing. Get out and vote. Who, by the way, who's already voted? All right, that's it. But we have a tendency to vote on election day of Republicans. So let me ask you, who is planning to vote tomorrow? Very important. Very important. Is anybody planning to vote for sleepy Joe Biden? Please raise your Does anybody have the courage? Raise you alright? Yeah. Get out and vote. Well, that's good. That's a lot of people. So a lot of you vote a little bit early then. Do you trust the ballot system? Do you do early voting or do you do with the ballot early? I like early, but earliest good. Early is good. Ballot is not good. We got a very horrible, horrible ruling from the Supreme Court of the United States. A ruling that puts our country in danger. Actually, on Pennsylvania, they have so much time to do this thing. Oh, let them put their votes in and give them plenty of time. You know we have a date. It's called November 3rd. We don't have a date that says many days later we don't have a date that says you're allowed. Thio, go and start. You know, putting your vote in later and we can tabulate it later. Take your time. The whole world is waiting to find out, and there's great danger in that number one. There's danger that there's a lot of shenanigans that go on from that time forth. There's a lot of shenanigans, and then there's a lot of bad things that can happen with with the streets. I mean, you're gonna have a population that's going to be very, very angry, and you just can't do that. That is such a dangerous decision that is such a disappointment. When I heard that decision, it's a terrible decision. Just you go take a look at it and I know you people to take you to look at it. But there's not a decision that I've ever heard of, like that where people, if you wanna put your ballot in and if you want, you go and you put it in two or three or four weeks early, you don't going. But yeah, he said. You had a whole year. You had a lot of time. You had a lot of time. So they say, Oh, this is so terrible. You know, they gave him extra time and then all the time, So now there were gonna be all waiting around because Pennsylvania We're gonna win Pennsylvania. It's a great state. But you know, it's didn't like you. It's in a total shut down. They shut it down. The governor is a Democrat. He shut it down. It'll probably open on the fourth. It will open up the hill announced. Ladies and gentlemen, now that the election's over, we're gonna open it up. Right? But you can't do that. That's a very, very dangerous decision by the Supreme Court. I guess it was a political decision. I don't know what it was. I don't know what they were thinking. And you know what? Maybe I should maybe I shouldn't be speaking this way. I'm very disappointed on behalf of this country that a thing like this could happen because we could be waiting for weeks before we ever find out what's going on. The whole world is waiting for this decision. It's a very sad It's a very sad thing and hopefully it's going to be changed. Hopefully their wisdom and they have wisdom. Hopefully their wisdom will prevail and they'll do something and lawyers will be going in and they'll be fighting and, you know, but people, in fact, it's all over television tonight. I'm coming from place to place and I'm the good thing about Air Force One. It's got more televisions and any hotel room in the world. Okay, you have them on the floors you have on the ceilings, you have them all over and you see the comments that are being made about the decision and some of the pros. They're saying there's a very dangerous decision for our country because so many things, I mean, they're going to say, Well, how Maney votes short our way. We need 6000 votes. Well, let's take 6000 of these. We'll put them over here. Let's take 6000 of these. It's going to be cheating. It's going to be cheating. It's like they're putting these people. And you know what? We don't consider the people that have been running elections in Philadelphia. To be very honest, we've had a lot of problems with Philadelphia, so that's the story. And hopefully that will be changed. And I'm sure the people would say, Oh, you shouldn't speak that way about the Supreme Court. We've had so many bad decisions out of the Supreme Court that I will speak that way, and that's the way it is. This election is also a choice between a deadly Biden locked down and a safe vaccine that ends. And by the way, we're rounding the turn anyway. But we have great vaccines. We have great vaccines coming. We have great vaccines coming, and it's a lot of good things were happening. And you know, when you look at the therapeutics Excuse me, I'm right here. No, I don't think the therapeutic help. May. I don't think I needed it. I'm glad I got it right, Regeneron. We're gonna make it available free to anybody that needs it. We're making it available free to anybody that needs it free. But I'll tell you what. I'm sure I didn't because I'm you know, I'm a perfect physical specimen and I am considered very, very young. I'm considered young for my age. No, I'm a perfect specimen. I'm in perfect shape. So I'm sure I would have thrown it away, But no, but I had it. And the next morning I was not feeling good at all. I tell you, the doctor said, sir, I hate to say it. You've just tested positive. I said, Doc, Sean, Great doctor. White House Doctor. I said, Sean, tell me, what does that mean? Tested positive For what? Sir? You've tested positive for the China plague. He used it much nicer and he said Co vid He said, Cove in. You know, it's got about 37 names. You know that we could. David, I always like to have a China in there because I like to be accurate. But But he said So you've tested positive for Kobe, said, I'm in the middle of the campaign. I can't be positive for covert. And so anyway, so I Waas and I didn't feel too good, and the first lady had it. At least now you know that all those rumors is that she lives in Virginia. Separate. I mean, at least now you know she lives in the White House because he got it. Probably for me or whatever. I don't know what the hell you know. Do you ever hear the first lady lives in Virginia in a beautiful house over a river or something? No, no. She lives here, but at least that and then I know people love the first lady. They love them. Lady stew. They love the first lady. It's true. They love her. She's doing a good job. They love that whole family back there. They love that family back there. Great family. Hi, Tiffany. So So then. So Melania has it, But she knocked it out pretty good. And I did a great job, you know, I was surrounded by these doctors. 12 doctors. I've told the story. Each one was a specialist. Johns Hopkins. Walter Reed Medical Center is incredible. You know, that's our military center. It's incredible. And I'm surrounded, right? I'm just surrounded by these brilliant doctors. One thing when you're president, you get a lot of doctors, and each doctor grabbed a different part of my body and I said, I don't like this at all, But they told me about this one thing and I said, I really do. I like it. I really But it was very, you know, a little bit early. What we've done with getting it through the FDA has been incredible. Biden wouldn't have this stuff done for years. We had his chance with the swine flu and totally blew it right. It was a disaster. It was a disaster. Anyway. So I wake up the next morning and I'm telling you, I felt like Superman. I was so I wanted to get out. I said, give me another trade deal to re negotiate that these clowns have screwed up. Give me a trade deal to re negotiate. And where am I supposed to be? Well, sir, could you take it easy for a couple of days? And people are sort of amazed I've done these things. I mean, I do them these air. Not easy to do. Especially when you have no damn microphone. I mean, I'm working harder on this one that I have on all six that I did today. This is the hardest one because I have a microphone that was obviously meant for congressmen and senators, not for a president. So it's a little bit off, but that's okay. You know, you have to learn how to isn't that funny when he put it back in here and handed it to me. But that's the way we started. I thought that was better. Nobody got that. Only this front row got that one. I thought that was very clever, actually. But then he came up to me. The doctor, Sean. He said, sir, I'm sorry to inform you that your son Baron has tested positive again. I said brilliantly for what he said for Covert. I said, Oh, that's terrible. Oh, no, he'll be okay, sir. He'll be okay. I said, It's terrible, but he's young and he's strong, and he's very tall. Have you ever seen I say hi? Barry, 14 years old. He's very tall. He's definitely tall, and he's strong. But he's young. And I said, That's terribly said, no, he'll be okay, so he'll be okay. And I said, Well, I hope, like, 12 minutes later, I say, How's Baron doing, Doctor? Sir, he's 100%. Now. He's get your kids back to school. Okay? Right. Get him back to school. All right, so we're gonna mess, distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks. It's gonna be coming out very soon, and we will quickly eradicate the virus, wipe out the China plague once and for all. Get it the hell out of here. We will never forget either. We will not forget. That was not good. You know, we made a great trade deal with China, is you know very well, but you know, the ink wasn't dry before we got this. And no good no good. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state. Locking you in your home while you're you're far left. Anarchists are allowed to roam the streets, burned down your cities, hit people over the head. They're allowed to do that. That's why I always call all of these rallies. Protests these air not rallies anymore. Because you're allowed to have a protest. You can't have a rally and you can't go to church. You know you're not allowed to go to church, but you're allowed Thio burn down the cities with the protest. So we always call these friendly protests. The Biden lock down will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, no Easter, no Fourth of July and no future. Other than that, it's really not a bad way to go. A vote for Sleepy Joe Biden is a vote for lockdowns, layoffs, misery and no fracking. How about the guy? No fracking. For over a year and a half, there will be no fracking. He goes to Pennsylvania Absolutely Well, Frank. Okay. And these guys don't do anything about it. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus. A job to support your family and freedom to live your life. Then you have no choice but to cast your ballot for a gentleman named Donald J Trump. And as I said, And you have to remember this, you know, because during the debate, the debate was good. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Very thanks. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. It's a great honor to be with you. I really did. During the Kenosha disaster. I really got to be friendly with a lot of people up here long before that because we've had so many different people that we deal with. You have great people. We're gonna introduce you a few of them. But you have great people here. But I really got to know you're doing that problem. That potential crisis that we put out very, very swiftly once we got called and it's great, you're great people. You built the country. You're great people. Joe Biden. And as I said, he ran the, uh, h one n when he called it n one h when he couldn't get it right. He still does. He can't get it right I said, Joe H comes before and it's easy to remember H one n one swine flu. And he failed horribly. And he was a laughing stock all over Washington. As you remember and his chief of staff. I don't know why this guy said it, but he made the worst statements. He said, This guy, we have no idea what we're doing now. All of a sudden he's coming. And he said he was the one that said I shouldn't close it down. China heavily infected China, right? You remember that mess anyway? Then now he runs, He said I should have closed it sooner. It Zraly disgraceful. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, a respected man. He said Biden has been wrong or nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four years. Right? Four years, he said. He's always wrong, and he has been always wrong. I don't believe he's even running. I can't believe the whole thing I've watched. I watched the debates. You had 27 total killers on the stage and he was there and but you don't have to believe me because it's you and because it's Wisconsin, we spent a fortune and hopefully that will work better than the microphone. Try it. Put it off. Joe Budden. Joe Budden The oh, How do you take it? This was today. You forgot the show. I haven't taken the test. Why the hell would I take a test? Come on, man. That's like saying you before you got in this program, you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not. What do you think, Huh? Are you a Jodi's? By the way? This my little sister Valerie. And I'm Jill's husband. Oh, no. You switched on me. This is my sister. They switched on me. E tell it if you have a problem figuring out whether you're familiar, Trump and you ain't black, there is not a single solitary reason in the world. Why? Why? As I said, we shouldn't be in a position that everybody. And that's my wife, Jill. Hey, Julie. I'm Jill's husband, actually. And corn Pop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys.

And I think it's a right for people have bad kept care. We have to do at least several things. One, we have Thio depend on what the president is going to do right now. And first of all, he has thio tell, uh, wait till the cases before anything happens. Look, exacerbating the need for environmental firms up environmental justice. Sorry. As a bug, we got a lot of work to do. I don't need you to get me elected the case. We cannot let this. We've never allowed any crisis from the Civil War straight through to the pandemic of 17 all the way around 16 we have never, never let our democracy six second fiddle way that we can both have a democracy on elections and at the same time correct the public health everywhere. I've been hearing all around the country. You're trying your breast, but it never feels like enough. It's And here comes the train that he tried to make sure didn't continue to up front.

I guess when you think about but But this is not what our country can have. We can have this one thing. I'll tell you. I learned President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jeong Eun of North Korea and many others. All of them. They're very sharp. They're very smart. They're very sharp.

We're not playing a game, you know, we have a good time tonight. We love each other, having fun. But when you get right there, it's not about fun. We can't let this happen to our country.

And we're really you know, we didn't need this. We had a wonderful super. It was just going good. Then I said, You know, maybe I'll give it a shot. You know why? Because of trade, it started because of trade. I hated. I watched. It was so obvious the way we were being ripped off on trade. And I said, Let's give it a world. And I said to my wife, I'd like to do it. What do you think she said? Well, you have to really want it because you know you will win, don't you? I said, Do you think so? Really? She had more. She had a little more security in the fact that if I ran no, she said, You will win if you but you have to make sure you want it. I said I want to do it because we have so many things we could do I never thought we would have done what we've done, though we've done Ah lot together together. We've done so much. You think about all It probably started more. I talked to Ron about it. Probably started with trade because I hated our companies were leaving to Mexico, Canada, China. They were all leaving our country. We have these stupid laws and horrible tax deals where they had incentives to move to Mexico, they got incentivized to move to Mexico. Somebody had a concept G. Let's make Mexico great again. You know, I said No, I want to make our country great again. So that's the story. It's a complicated story, but it all evolved into this evening and tomorrow we have our big day, and tomorrow I think that I think it's gonna be a really special day, and I hope you can all go out. You'll find the time and go out and vote, and we're gonna make you very proud. You're gonna make your gonna be made really very proud. I just finishing off. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we're finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs and our factories and our troops. Finally. Finally, finally, we're bringing them back home to the Yusa, where they belong. For 47 years, Joe Biden viciously attacked black Americans. He called young Black men super predators all the time. To every black American. I am asking you to go out tomorrow and votes very important. This is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to jail you and to betray you. I'm fighting for you, and we got criminal justice reform completed prison reform, completed opportunity zones completed with a great Tim Scott of South Carolina and funding for historically black colleges and universities. We got that done and I say all the time, and sometimes people say that's a big statement. Then they realize it's true with the exception of Abraham Lincoln. There's never been a president that has done so much for the black community, and it's my honor. It's my honor. It is my honor and under my leadership, and by the way, I don't know if you've been watching what's going on in Florida. We're doing really well and you know what they're talking about. The black community on the Hispanic American community is really they're like in Trump. What's going on now? We're doing very well. Florida Florida is doing very well. So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It's already begun. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God's help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech on the right to keep and bear arms, your Second Amendment, which is totally under siege. But as long as Ron Johnson and your great congressmen are there, we will protect it, right? Land, everybody, we will protect it, Ron, that's an easy one for us, but it wouldn't be easy. If he got it. We wouldn't have enough to say about it. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise Medical building Require price Transparency starts on January 1st and it will be bigger than healthcare, lower drug prices, even Mawr favorite nations. The drug companies do not like me too much. I will tell you will have the lowest drug prices anywhere in the world. And we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. America will land. The first woman on the moon in the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and we will restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our Children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag on We will live by the timeless words of our national motto. In God we trust. For years you had a president who apologize to America. We had a sister. I mean, we have had I watched Obama go out and apologize all over the world. He would apologize all over the world. He apologize for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great great people of Wisconsin. Tomorrow you have the power. You have the vote. You have the power. Really? To save America, we can't go down that path. We will never be a socialist country. We will never be a so get your friends.

Green Bay to right here in Kenosha, we inherit the legacy of American Patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settle the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world.

         "Well, thank you all for being here today. To Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller, to the Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett, to General John Hyten, General Jay Raymond, General James Dickinson, General David Thompson, and General David Allvin: On behalf of the First Family, welcome to the White House. And welcome to the first anniversary of that branch of our Armed Forces that will ensure for generations that America remains as dominant in space as we are on land and sea and air. Welcome to the first anniversary of the United States Space Force. (Applause.) Many kind things have been said about your Vice President, but I have to tell you I am the second-biggest champion of the Space Force in this administration. So as we begin, allow me to bring greetings and first anniversary congratulations from a champion of everyone who wears the uniform of the United States and the founder of the United States Space Force. I bring greetings and congratulations from the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) We just left the Oval Office with the President. And from the very first moment that he conceived of the idea of creating a new branch of our Armed Forces dedicated to our security in space, he has been an enthusiast, and I can testify , as the Acting Secretary and the Secretary of the Air Force can attest , that enthusiasm has only grown in the last year. And he's proud of each and every one of you, as I am. But we're grateful to the contributions of all of you in this room, and to the speakers who have preceded me at this podium, for bringing us to the fruition of this first year, but, more importantly, bringing us to this day, a year ago Sunday, that saw the creation of the first new branch of our Armed Forces in more than 70 years. And there are members of Congress who are with us today who I remember in those critical moments in the legislative process who were absolutely indispensable. And I'd like you to join me in thanking Congressman Doug Lamborn for your great leadership on behalf of our Space Force. (Applause.) And the first person ever to mention to me that we ought to restart the National Space Council. Even before I had this job, he was one of the greatest champions of American leadership in space and the Congress of the United States: Congressman Brian Babin. Thank you. (Applause.) And I want to give particular note to a member of the United States Senate who, in the late going, was there fighting to ensure that we would establish a new branch of our Armed Forces that would have a foundation of independence to be able to grow for generations and serve the security of our nation. So join me in thanking Senator Kevin Cramer for your outstanding and seminal leadership. (Applause.) I also want to take a moment to express my appreciation to two members of Congress who are not here but who have been and remain champions and emblematic of the bipartisan support that this new branch of our Armed Forces enjoys across the Congress of the United States. Join me in thanking Congressman Adam Smith, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and the incoming ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman Mike Rogers , two leaders who have championed the United States Space Force. (Applause.) And it's my greatest honor to be here with so many warriors who have stood in the gap for America and to be able to thank you for your service, and to thank you for the foundation that you've helped pour for future generations of Americans in our security in space. There are several people to thank, but I , there's a man who I consider to be a giant in the realm of American leadership in space. He's a former commander of the Air Force Space Command. I first , I first met him at Offutt Air Force Base, when he was leading our Strategic Command forces there. He actually comes from a family that's been involved in American space enterprise throughout his life. And at just the right time, he became Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Would you join me in thanking General John Hyten and his wonderful wife Laura? (Applause.) I know the President knows is what I know , is we wouldn't be here without you, General. So thank you so very much for your strong leadership. But to all the members of our Armed Forces with us here today: Thank you for your service to our great nation. And thank you for your enthusiastic participation in this first year of the launch of the United States Space Force. You know, yesterday marked the birthday of flight. History records that it was 117 years ago that two sons of a Heartland preacher , one of whom was born in Indiana , (laughter) , did what for all of history had seemed impossible when they took their first flight to the skies over Kitty Hawk. But in just a few short days, on Sunday, December the 20th, we will mark the formal anniversary of another American breakthrough. On Sunday, it will be one year since President Donald Trump signed into law the first new branch of our Armed Forces in more than 70 years. That historic moment was a culmination of an effort that began from the early days of this administration , from almost the first moment that the President and I spoke about space when we were campaigning for these jobs. He had a dual focus of renewing American leadership in human space exploration, but also ensuring that America remained as dominant in space as we are in land and air and sea. And from the first day of this administration, President Trump called for steps to renew American leadership in space. It would be in June of 2018, the President first laid out a vision that called for the creation of a new military service focused solely on threats in and from space. The idea, though, and its conception was not a new one. For more than 50 years, Presidents and military leaders had discussed a branch of our military dedicated to ensuring American national security in and from space, but time and again, those efforts faltered. But I would submit to you that it is a tribute to the leadership of our Commander-in-Chief, a tribute to the extraordinary military leadership gathered here today that this time, with bipartisan support, in just one and a half years, the United States Space Force was born. (Applause.) And since that historic moment, the United States Space Force has only grown stronger by the day. And that means that America has grown more secure by the day. After the Space Force became law, the President's first decision was who would lead it. And the President and I get the sense in the room, there is broad agreement that he got that decision right too. He chose a man , (applause) , He chose a man who , you've heard from these podiums already , is considered to be the Hap Arnold of our time. He would become the Chief of Space Operations of the United States Space Force. And I can tell you, having witnessed his leadership firsthand, that when General Jay Raymond stepped forward, it brought the leadership, the energy, the vision, the professionalism, and the patriotism necessary to have this historic year for the United States Space Force. So join me in thanking General Jay Raymond, his wonderful wife Mollie, and his proud son Gary for all of their commitment to America. (Applause.) Thank you, General. Good job. It's amazing to think that this spring General Raymond actually welcomed the first enlisted member to the Space Force. So how about a round of applause for Chief Master Sergeant Roger Towberman? (Applause.) You can stand up. Come on, stand up. Thank you. Thank you, Chief. In April, those two men were literally the entire United States Space Force. (Laughter.) But in just eight months, we already have more than 2,000 military members , space professionals in the United States Space Force. And I'm told that an additional 3,600 officers and enlisted airmen have already started to fill out the paperwork to transfer into the Space Force. (Applause.) In fact, General Raymond tells us that we anticipate, on our current trajectory, the Space Force will have nearly 6,000 space professionals serving all across the globe in just a short period of time. In fact, today, the Space Force got its newest and perhaps most famous member , a man who is actually in space right now, at the International Space Station. General Raymond took care of the paperwork, and I think it might actually be the first in-orbit transfer in military history. Colonel Michael Hopkins, NASA astronaut and member of the United States Space Force. (Applause.) Great move. You know, heroes like him and like all of you are going to inspire generations of Americans. In fact, Secretary Barbara Barrett and I witnessed some of those young Americans stepping forward in Colorado Springs, where we both had the opportunity to address the 62nd Graduation of the United States Air Force Academy. When I was there, they told me, in a typical year, about 20 cadets choose to go into space operations. This year, I was there when 86 cadets stood up and took the oath as officers in the United States Space Force. (Applause.) And just to continue to build on the momentum, I'm proud to report to the senator and these members of Congress and all those looking on that it was my honor , with Secretary Barrett at my side and General Raymond, as well , that we made it official. We traveled to Florida to announce the first two Space Force installations in American history: Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and Patrick Space Force Base. (Applause.) And the Space Force is growing stronger every day and just in the nick of time. I think every one of the military leaders here knows that space is a vacuum, but we're not operating in a vacuum. The space race began in the 1950s, and it continues today. And in President Donald Trump, we have a Commander-in-Chief who has understood clearly that space is a warfighting domain and it's imperative that we invest the resources and the personnel and the technology to defend our nation and defend our values in the outer reaches of space. In fact, the United States, as you've heard already, faces emerging threats in space for countries like China and Russia, and those threats are only growing. We were reminded of that just this week, when Russia conducted yet another anti-satellite missile launch. We're leading in space, but our determination under this President and with his extraordinary military leadership, is to stay in the lead to defend America and defend our freedom from space. (Applause.) We seek peace through strength. And I want to say to the men and women of the United States Space Force: When it comes to the outer reaches of space, you are that strength. So today, we celebrate leadership from our President, the great bipartisan support in the Congress, and the military leadership that has seen to both the birth and the pouring of the first year's foundation of the United States Space Force. And I just came here today to thank each and every one of you, but also to make another announcement. As I mentioned, we just returned from the Oval Office. And so it is my honor, on behalf of the President of the United States, to announce that, henceforth, the men and women of the United States Space Force will be known as 'Guardians.' (Applause.) Soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Guardians will be defending our nation for generations to come. (Applause.) So, with that announcement, let me just say thank you again. I want to thank the members of Congress who are with us today. Thank you for the honor of your presence, but more importantly, thank you , thank you for your leadership in bringing us to this moment one year ago and the support that you've continued to provide to see to the launch of this new branch of our Armed Forces. But on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, let me urge each and every one of you Guardians to keep pushing. Keep pushing. Keep pushing the vision and the mission of the United States Space Force, which is to ensure that America remains as dominant in space, and from space, as we are on land and sea and air. And to each one of you Guardians, let me just say: Each and every day, from this day forward, I want to assure you that you will serve with the confidence of your Commander-in-Chief. You will serve with the confidence and gratitude of the American people. And I'm also convinced that those of you that will serve in the United States Space Force, in this generation and generations to come, will also go with the prayers of millions of Americans who will claim that ancient verse that promises that: If you rise on the wings of the dawn, if you settle on the far side of the sea, even if you go up to the heavens, that there His hand will guide you and his right hand will hold you fast. That then will be our prayer for our Guardians in this generation and for generations to come. So Happy Birthday to the United States Space Force. God bless our Guardians. God bless all the members of our Armed Forces. And God bless America. Semper Supra. (Applause.)",

         "Once again , the words 'I can't breathe.' An act of brutality so elemental, it did more than deny one more black man in America his civil rights and his human rights. It denied his very humanity. It denied him of his life. Depriving George Floyd , as it deprived Eric Garner , of the one thing every human being must be able to do: Breathe. So simple. So basic. So brutal. The same thing happened with Ahmaud Arbery. The same with Breonna Taylor. The same thing with George Floyd. We've spoken their names aloud. Cried them out in pain and horror. Chiseled them into long suffering hearts. They are the latest additions to an endless list of lives stolen , potential wiped out unnecessarily. It's a list that dates back more than 400 years: black men, black women, black children. The original sin of this country still stains our nation today. Sometimes we manage to overlook it, and just push forward with the thousand other tasks of daily life. But it's always there. And weeks like this, we see it plainly. We are a country with an open wound. None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words , 'I can't breathe' , and do nothing. We cannot fall victim to what Martin Luther King called the 'appalling silence of the good people.' Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering , who will be next? Imagine if every time your husband or son, wife or daughter, left the house, you feared for their safety from bad actors and bad police. Imagine if you had to have that talk with your child about not asserting their rights , and taking the abuse handed out to them , just so they could make it home. Imagine having the police called on you , for just sitting in Starbucks or renting an Airbnb or watching birds. That is the norm for black people in this nation , they don't have to imagine it. The anger and the frustration and the exhaustion , it's undeniable. But that is not the promise of America. And it is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all people. This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism. It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation. We need justice for George Floyd. We need real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet , that holds bad cops accountable, and that repairs the relationship between law enforcement and the community they are sworn to protect. And we need to stand up as a nation , with the black community, and with all minority communities , and come together as one America. That's the challenge we face. And it will require those of us who sit in positions of influence to finally deal with the abuse of power. The pain is too immense for one community to bear alone. It is the duty of every American to grapple with it , and grapple with it now. With our complacency, our silence , we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence. Nothing about this will be easy or comfortable. But if we simply allow this wound to scab over once more, without treating the underlying injury , we will never truly heal. The very soul of America is at stake. We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. We have to pursue it with real urgency. We have to make real the American promise, which we have never fully grasped: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives.",

         "Well, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Wow. (Applause.) Well, thank you very much, everybody. Wow. We've all been through a lot together, and we probably deserve that hand for all of us, because it's been a very unfair situation. I invited some of our very good friends. And we have limited room, but everybody wanted to come. We kept it down to a minimum. And believe it or not, this is a minimum. But a tremendous thing was done over the last number of months, but really, if you go back to it, over the last number of years. We had the witch hunt. It started from the day we came down the elevator, myself and our future First Lady, who's with us right now. Thank you, Melania. (Applause.) And it never really stopped. We've been going through this now for over three years. It was evil. It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars. And this should never, ever happen to another President ever. I don't know that other Presidents would have been able to take it. Some people said, no, they wouldn't have. But I can tell you, at a minimum, you have to focus on this because it can get away very quickly. No matter who you have with you, it can get away very quickly. It was a disgrace. Had I not fired James Comey , who was a disaster, by the way , it's possible I wouldn't even be standing here right now. We caught him in the act. Dirty cops. Bad people. If this happened to President Obama, a lot of people would have been in jail for a long time already. Many, many years. I want to start by thanking some of , and I call them friends, because, you know, you develop friendships and relationships when you're in battle and war, much more so than, 'Gee, let's have a normal situation.' With all that we've gone through, we've done, I think, more than any President and administration, and really, I say, for the most part, Republican congressmen, congresswomen, and Republican senators. We've done more than any administration in the first few years, if you look at all of the things we've done. I watched this morning as they tried to take credit for the stock market from , (laughter) , from , think of that. Let me tell you, if we didn't win, the stock market would have crashed. And the market was going up a lot before the election because it was looking we had a good chance to win, and then it went up tremendously from the time we won the election until the time we took office, which was November 8th to January 20th. And that's our credit. That's all our credit. And leading up to that point was our credit because there was hope. And one of the reasons the stock market has gone up so much in the last few days is people think we're doing so well. They liked the State of the Union speech. (Applause.) It really is , it's a true honor to give it. Making the State of the Union speech, I was with some people that have been around; they've been all over the world. And one of them, a highly sophisticated person, said, 'You know, no matter where you go in the world, it doesn't make any difference , there is nothing like what I witnessed tonight.' The beauty, the majesty of the Chamber. The power of the United States, the power of the people in this room. Really, an amazing , I don't think there is anything like that anywhere in the world. You can go to any other country, you can go to any other location, any other place. It's the beauty of everything. It's what it represents and how it represents our country. I want to start by introducing some of the people that are here. I know some are going to be left out. But they work so hard. And this is really not a news conference. It's not a speech. It's not anything. It's just we're sort of , it's a celebration, because we have something that just worked out. I mean, it worked out. We went through hell, unfairly. Did nothing wrong. Did nothing wrong. I've done things wrong in my life, I will admit. (Laughter.) Not purposely, but I've done things wrong. But this is what the end result is. (Applause.) (The President holds up the front cover of The Washington Post newspaper.) We can take that home, Honey. Maybe we'll frame it. (Laughter.) It's the only good headline I've ever had in the Washington Post, I'll tell you. (Laughter.) But every paper is the same. Does anybody have those papers? Does anybody have them? Because they're really like that. So I appreciate that. But some of the people here have been incredible warriors. They're warriors. And there's nothing, from a legal standpoint , this is a political thing. And every time, I'd say, 'This is unfair. Let's go to court.' They'd say, 'Sir, you can't go to court. This is politics.' And we were treated unbelievably unfairly. And you have to understand, we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bullshit. (Laughter.) We then went through the Mueller report. And they should have come back one day later. They didn't. They came back two years later, after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money. People came to Washington to help other people. 'Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,' I say. They came , one or two or three people in particular, but many people. We had a rough campaign. It was nasty. It was one of the nastiest, they say. They say Andrew Jackson was always the nastiest campaign. They actually said we topped it. (Laughter.) It was a nasty , it was a nasty , both in the primaries and in the , in the election. But, you see, we thought, after the election, it would stop. But it didn't stop; it just started. And tremendous corruption. Tremendous corruption. So we had a campaign. Little did we know we were running against some very, very bad and evil people with fake dossiers, with all of these horrible, dirty cops that took these dossiers and did bad things. They knew all about it. The FISA courts should be ashamed of themselves. It's a very tough thing. And then we ended up winning on Russia, Russia, Russia. It should have taken the one day, as I said, and it took years. Then Bob Mueller testified. That didn't work out so well for the other side. (Laughter.) But they should have said, that first week , because it came out. Is that right, Jim Jordan? They knew in the first two days actually. Devin, is that right? Two days. They knew that we were totally innocent. But they kept it going, Mark. They kept it going forever because they wanted to inflict political pain on somebody that had just won an election that, to , a lot of people were surprised. I mean, we had polls that said we were going to win. We had Los Angeles Times and a few , a few papers, actually, said it was , we were going to win but it was going to be close. And we did win. It was one of the greatest wins of all time. And they said, 'Okay, he won.' And, you know, I wrote this down because that was where a thing called the 'insurance policy' , to me, when I saw the insurance policy , and that was done long before the election. That was done when they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win. And, by the way, Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for millions , millions of dollars , the fake dossier. And now Christopher Steele admits that it's a fake because he got sued by rich people. I should have sued him too. But when you're President, people don't like suing. I want to thank my legal team, by the way , not for that advice, but for other advice. (Applause.) Pat, Jay. Pat. You guys stand up, please. (Applause.) Great job. (Applause.) Right at the beginning, they said, 'Sir, you have nothing to worry about. All of the facts are on your side.' I said, 'You don't understand. That doesn't matter. That doesn't matter.' And that was really true. They made up facts. A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president. He brought it out of thin air. Just made it up. They say he's a screenwriter , a failed screenwriter. He tried to go into , unfortunately, he went into politics after that. (Laughter.) Remember he said the statement, which is a mob statement: 'Don't call me. I'll call you.' I didn't say that. Fortunately, for all of us here today and for our country, we had transcripts. We had transcribers , professional transcribers. Then they said, 'Oh, well, maybe the transcription is not correct.' But Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother , right? , we had some people that , really amazing. But we did everything. We said, 'What's wrong with it?' 'Well, they didn't add this word or that one.' It didn't matter. I said, 'Add it. They're probably wrong, but add it.' So now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate. When you read those transcripts, Tim Scott , I don't know if Tim is here, but he said, 'Sir ' He was the first one to call me. 'Sir, I read the transcript. You did nothing wrong.' And, Mitch, he stayed there, right from the beginning. He never changed. And, Mitch McConnell, I want to tell you: You did a fantastic job. (Applause.) Somebody said, 'You know, Mitch is quiet.' I said, 'He's not quiet. He's not quiet.' These are the , he doesn't want people to know him. And they said, 'Is Mitch smart?' I said, 'Well, let's put it this way: For many, many years, a lot of very smart , bad, in many cases, sometimes good , but people have been trying to take his place. And to the best of my knowledge, I've never even heard the subject come up, because they've been wiped out so fast. (Laughter.) This guy is great, and I appreciate it, Mitch. (Applause.) And he's also given us 191 now. (Applause.) A hundred and ninety-one federal judges. Two Supreme Court judges, right? It's up to 191. (Applause.) True. Great guy. Great guy. He's a tough guy to read. I'm good at reading people. A tough guy to read. I'd call him. My wife would say, 'How did you do with Mitch?' 'Uhh, I don't know.' (Laughter.) That's what makes him good , when you can read somebody. Fantastic job. And he understood, rightfully, that this was crooked politics. This was crooked politics. How about all these people, they're running for office. They're saying the worst things about me, like eight senators on the Democrat side. Most of them got wiped out. You know, they got their 1 percent or less. Most of them got less. They decided to go home. 'Let's go back to California.' Let's go back to wherever they came from. 'Let's go back to New York.' How about that one? Our New York senator, Gillibrand. 'Let's go back to New York,' after they get nothing. And then they take an oath that they will be fair, that they will be reason- , and all of the different things. And they had to sign. They're not fair. But here's the beauty: So we have four left. They're saying the most horrendous things about me. It's okay, it's politics. And then they're supposed to vote , on me. They're trying to replace me, and then they're supposed to be voting. So I think it's , I mean, I think it's incredible. But , so, Mitch, I want to thank you very much. Incredible. And you have some of your folks here, and they're incredible people , and they've been, right from the beginning. And, again, you're out of session. Unfortunately, I didn't , you know, I only told these folks, 'Let's do this today.' We did a prayer breakfast this morning, and I thought that was really good. In fact, that was so good it might wipe this out. But by the end , by the time we finished this, we'll wipe that one out , those statements. (Laughter.) I had , I had Nancy Pelosi sitting four seats away, and I'm saying things that a lot of people wouldn't have said , (laughter) , but I meant every , (laughter) , I meant every word of it. But we have some of the folks that are going to be leaving right after this, and they work hard , and they did work hard. Bill Cassidy, Senator. Stand up, Bill. What a guy. (Applause.) Great man. When I need to know about health insurance and preexisting conditions and individual mandates, I call Bill or I call Barrasso. We get those two guys; they know more than anybody. A man who just became a senator , he's a little bit like me; we have a couple of them. A very successful guy in business, and he said, 'What the hell, I'll run for the Senate' , from Indiana. And he ran. And I saw him on television, destroying his opponent in a debate. I said, 'You know, this guy could win.' And I got behind him. And, Mike Braun, you have done some great job. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Tough. Tough. Thank you. A man who got James Comey to choke, and he was just talking in his regular voice. He is the roughest man. He's actually an unbelievable , and I appreciate the letter you sent me today. I just got it. But he's got this voice that scares people. (Laughter.) You know, people from Iowa can be very tough. We're doing very well in Iowa. But I'll tell you, Chuck Grassley , he's looking at Comey: 'Well, you tell me, what did you say?' (Laughter.) Now, he wasn't being rough. That was just the way he talked. (Laughter.) And that was when Comey , I think that was when Comey announced that he was leaking, lying, and everything else, right? He choked because he never heard anybody talk like that. (Laughter.) You know, you should have gone , I wish you got angry. You could have gotten the whole ballgame. He would have said, 'I give up.' (Laughter.) Chuck Grassley is an incredible guy. (Applause.) And a man who , you know, he was running against a tough, smart campaign and we learned how good she was, right? She was a great campaigner. In fact, by the end of the campaign, she was actually , I thought she was more for me than you were, Josh. I was worried. (Laughter.) I saw her ad; she was saying the greatest things about me. And you know who I'm talking about. And I went to a great place , Missouri , and I said, 'Who do you have to beat her?' And they said, 'Well, we have four people.' I said, 'Let me see them. I'm got to interview ' , can you imagine? I'm interviewing people for the United States Senate. This is what I do. Where have I gone? But I love it. I love it because we're getting great people. The first one I met was Josh Hawley. After about 10 minutes, I said to the people, 'Don't show me anybody else. This is the guy.' He was the attorney general. Did a phenomenal job in the state. Highly respected. And , Claire McCaskill. So, the theory was you couldn't beat her. Great campaigner. Remember the last campaign, she was going to be taken out. She was always going to be taken out, then she wins and people say, 'How did that happen?' Didn't happen with him. But she got so friendly toward me. In fact, one of the ads I still have. I'm putting it in the archives as one of the best ads I've ever made. (Laughter.) And she tried to convince people that we were best friends. But Josh ended up winning by five or six points. You were unbelievable. You were tough. And you are something. And one of the greatest supporters on the impeachment hoax was Josh Hawley. He was incensed actually; I watched it. He was incensed at what they were doing and what they were saying. And those were the ones , you know, I had some that said, 'Oh, I wish you didn't make the call.' And that's okay, if they need that. It's incorrect. It's totally incorrect. And then you have some that used religion as a crutch. They never used it before. An article written today: 'Never heard him use it before.' But today, you know, it's one of those things. But, you know, it's a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for President. But, Josh Hawley, I want to thank you. You were right from the beginning. Man, did I make a good choice. (Applause.) Thank you, Josh. Tremendous future. A man who is brilliant and who actually was deceived, to an extent, comes from a great state, Utah, where my poll numbers have gone through the roof. And one of the senators' poll numbers, and not this one, went down big. You saw that. You saw that, Mike? But Mike Lee is a brilliant guy. He's difficult. (Laughter.) Whenever I sign bills , you know, we do sign a lot of legislation that's , it's big and it's powerful, but it's sort of everybody has to approve it. And I see 99 to 1 , (laughter) , 99 to 1. I say, 'Don't tell me who's the one.' (Laughter.) 'Is it Mike?' 'Yes.' (Laughter.) And he always has a good reason for it too, by the way. But he is , he's incredible. And right at the beginning, he knew we were right, Mike, and I appreciate it very much. You're just fantastic. And say hello to the people of Utah and tell them, 'I'm sorry about Mitt Romney. I'm sorry.' (Laughter and applause.) Okay? We can say that Mike Lee is, by far, the most popular senator from the state. But you've done a fantastic job, Mike, in many ways. In many ways. A young woman who I didn't know at all, but she's been so supportive , and I've had great support from other people in that state. And she's been so supportive, and she's been downright nasty and mean about the unfairness to the President. And Kelly Loeffler, I appreciate very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Great. She saw it very early on, and we have , I don't know if we have other senators here, but we got a hell of a lot of congressmen. And I'll go over them quickly, but they have , they have also been , you know, it helped when we won 197 to nothing. That's got to be a first, Kevin. Right? Is that, like, a first? The Republicans have this image. See, I say Democrats are lousy politicians because they have lousy policy: open borders, sanctuary cities. They have horrible policy. Who the hell can win? Oh, their new policy is: Raise taxes. They want to raise taxes. You know, all my life, I wasn't in politics, but I'd say, if you're a politician, you want to say, 'We're going to lower taxes.' They want to raise taxes. So they have open borders, sanctuary cities. 'Raise everybody's taxes. Get rid of everybody's healthcare.' A hundred and eighty million people in the United States. And they're really happy. 'And we're going to give you a healthcare that's going to cost more money than the country could make in 30 years if it really does well.' That's one year. So I've always said they're lousy politicians, but they do two things: They are vicious and mean. Vicious. These people are vicious. Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. And she wanted to impeach a long time ago. When she said, 'I pray for the President. I pray for the ' , she doesn't pray. She may pray, but she prays for the opposite. (Laughter.) But I doubt she prays at all. And these are vicious people, but they do two things: They stick together, historically. I'm not talking now. They stick together like glue. That's how they impeached, because they had whatever the number is , 220 people. So if they don't lose anybody, they'll be able to impeach anybody. You could be George Washington. You could have just won the war, and they say, 'Let's get him out of office.' And they stuck together, and they're vicious as hell. And they'll probably come back for more, but maybe not because the Republican Party's poll numbers, Mitch, have now gone up more than any time, I think, since 2004, 2005, and you know what happened then. But in normal times , decades, you would call it; that was a little unusual time; it was for a very short period , the Republicans Party , Party's poll numbers and Donald Trump's poll numbers are the highest I've ever had them. So maybe they were. It's no way to get your poll numbers up. It's not worth it , because from my family's standpoint, it's been very unfair for my family. It's been very unfair to the country. Think of it. A phone call. A very good phone call. I know bad phone calls. This is a phone call with many people. I think Mike Pompeo was probably on the call. Where is Mike? Mike Pompeo was on the call. Many people were on the call. I know there were many people. They even have 'apprenti,' bringing up an old favorite word of mine. 'The Apprentice.' They have 'apprenti.' They have people on these calls. And I know there are many. When I speak to the head of a nation , and they have many people on. I mean, also on , do you think they just , in the case of Ukraine, he's a new president, seems like a very nice person, by the way. His whole thing was corruption. He's going to stop corruption. We even have a treaty , 2001, 1999. It's a treaty , signed treaty , that we will work together to root out corruption in Ukraine. I probably have a legal obligation, Mr. Attorney, to report corruption. But they don't think it's corrupt when a son that made no money, that got thrown out of the military, that had no money at all, is working for $3 million up front, $83,000 a month. And that's only Ukraine. Then goes to China, picks up $1.5 billion. Then goes to Romania, I hear, and many other countries. They think that's okay? Because if it is , is Ivanka in the audience? Is Ivanka here? Boy, my kids could make a fortune. (Laughter.) They could make a fortune. It's corrupt. But it's not even that; it's just general corruption. And the other thing, as mentioned in the call and something that I've told Mike Pence, our great Vice President , I would tell him all the time, and I told him when he went on the trip, because he was over there. He never mentioned anything about this when you had your meeting. It's a terrible thing. But I told Mike. I said, 'Mike, we're giving them money, and, you know, you're always torn about that because we have our country to build, we have our cities to build and our roads to fix. But we're giving them money. Tell me, why isn't Germany paying money? Why isn't France? Why isn't United Kingdom paying money? Why aren't they paying money? Why are we paying them money?' Is that a correct statement, Mike? I say, 'Find out what the hell is going on.' And I told that to all of my people, OMB. I said , I asked that question: 'How much is Germany paying? Why isn't Germany paying?' Why is the United States always the sucker? Because we're a bunch of suckers. But that's turning around fast. But it makes it harder when stuff like this happens, because you want to focus, and you want to focus perfectly. Think what we could have done if the same energy was put into infrastructure, prescription drug prices. Think of what we could have done. And I'm now talking both sides. Think of what we could have done if we had the same genius , because it's genius. I will say, it's genius on the other side , maybe even more so because they took nothing and brought me to a final vote of impeachment. That's a very ugly word to me. It's a very dark word. Very ugly. They took nothing. They took a phone call that was a totally appropriate call. I call it a 'perfect call' because it was. And they brought me to the final stages of impeachment. But now we have that gorgeous word , I never thought a word would sound so good. It's called 'total acquittal.' (Applause.) Total acquittal. So , so I want to, if I could, real fast, just introduce a few of the people. I have to start with , I have to start with Kevin. Man, did you do a job. Lucky you're there. Lucky you're there because it wouldn't have worked out. If you don't have the right people , I'll tell you, Kevin McCarthy has done an incredible job. (Applause.) Really. Stand up. And he loves this job, and he loves this country. I'll tell you what: Mitch and Kevin, they love what they do. Now, Mitch wouldn't even tell you he liked it. (Laughter.) I'd say, 'Mitch, do you like it?' 'I don't know.' (Laughter.) He's the greatest poker player, right? Kevin will say, 'I love it.' Right? And I will say that you're going to be Speaker of the House because of this impeachment hoax. (Applause.) I really believe it. I really believe it. And I'm going to work hard on it. I'm going to try and get out to those Trump , those Trump areas that we won by a lot. And, you know, in '18, we didn't win. We just won two seats in North Carolina , two wonderful seats in North Carolina that were not supposed to be won. But I went and I made speeches, and we had rallies, and we did a great job and we won. We took two seats. Nobody writes about that. If we lost them, it would have been the biggest story of the year. But we're going to go, we're going to do a job, and we're going to win a lot of seats. We're going to win a lot of seats. People are very angry that Nancy Pelosi and all of these guys , I mean, Nadler , I know him much of my life; he's fought me in New York for 25 years. I always beat him. And I had to beat him another time. And I'll probably have to beat him again. Because if they find that I happen to walk across the street, and maybe go against the light or something, 'Let's impeach him.' (Laughter.) So we'll probably have to do it again because these people have gone stone-cold crazy. But I've beaten them all my life, and I'll beat them again if I have to. (Applause.) But what they're doing is very unfair. Very unfair. So Kevin McCarthy has been great. So, a few names, right? And there'll be a few you forget. If you want, you can raise and I'll say, 'Great. Love to have you. Wonderful.' (Laughter.) But we're going to do the best we can. And I have my Cabinet, but my Cabinet is different , I appoint them. Okay? I didn't see all of them helping so much. (Laughter.) You know, they were running their various bureaucracies, right? (Laughter.) No, my Cabinet is great, and they're all here. But today is the day to celebrate these great warriors, right? These are great warriors. They really fought hard for us. And , So I'll start: Kelly Armstrong, North Dakota. Kelly, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) Great job. Jim Banks of Indiana. Jim, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) Andy Biggs. Where is Andy? Boy, oh, boy, Andy. He got , (applause) , there's a guy. He's tough. I hear we're doing well in Arizona, huh? It's going good, yeah? I think so. I think I saw a poll that was very good for me. I think we have to make sure Martha is going to do , I think Martha is going to do good. But we have some states that are going to be not easy, but Arizona has been great. And we're stopping illegal aliens from coming in. We're putting up walls. New Mexico, too, a state that's never been in play for Republicans, is totally in play. Right? Nevada is really looking good. We're doing well. We're doing well. We're going to have a great , there's more spirit. I will say this: There's more spirit now for the Republican Party, by far, than the Democrats. You know, Mike Pence just got back from a place , a beautiful place that Chuck Grassley knows well: Iowa. And he was talking about these fiasco , the Democrats, they can't count some simple votes, and yet they want to take over your healthcare system. Think of that. (Laughter.) No, think of it. But we also had an election out there, and we got 98 percent of the vote. We have two people running, you know, and I guess they consider them non-people, but they are running. I mean, one was a governor. One was a congressman. They're running. We got 98 percent of the vote. And everybody from the media was saying, 'Who are those crowds over there?' You know, they expect it to be one of these competitive , where everybody is running because they want to win, they want to win. And it was Trump. Right, Mark Meadows? It was Trump. This was a Trump crowd. And a lot of , actually, a lot of my guys went there. They went to Iowa. And a lot of friends went there, and we had tremendous , they say the spirit , the spirit for the Republican Party right now is stronger, I think, than it's ever been in the history of our country. I think it's stronger than it's ever been. (Applause.) And that includes Honest Abe Lincoln. You know, a lot of people forget Abe Lincoln. I wish he were here. I'd give him one hell of an introduction. Right? (Laughter.) But he was , he was a Republican. Abe Lincoln. Honest Abe. Bradley Byrne, Alabama. What a great place. (Applause.) Thank you, Bradley. A man who has been an unbelievable friend of mine and spokesman, and somebody that , that I really like. And I know, Kelly, you're going to end up liking him a lot. Something is going to happen that's going to be very good. I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet. But Doug Collins , where is he? Where is Doug? (Applause.) You have been so great. Thank you very much, Doug. Thank you very much. Thank you. Really amazing job. A young man who is , born with a great gene, because I know his father and how great a politician he was. But he's from Florida. Sometimes controversial, but actually, he's not controversial. He's solid as a rock and he's a friend of mine. Matt Gaetz. Matt? (Applause.) Thank you, Matt. Thank you. Great job. All right, this guy. So he's the NCAA , meaning, a couple of years ago, when he was in college , wrestling champion. NCAA. That's the big deal. That means, in all of college, you're the champ, you're the best. His record was ridiculous. Nobody would , nobody could beat him. And I see it. You know, every time, I see it. When I first got to know him , Jim Jordan , when I first got to know Jim, I said, 'Huh, he never wears a jacket. What the hell is going on?' (Laughter.) He's obviously very proud of his body. (Laughter and applause.) And they say where he works out , you know, where the congressmen, senators, they work out , they say, when Jim works out , even though he's not as young as he was, but he works out , the machine starts burning. You know, it's just a different form of a workout than us. Right, Sonny? And , there he is. Look at that guy. But one day I'm looking, and he looks tough. And I'm looking, and I'm looking at those ears. And I say, 'Those ears have something going on there.' I said, 'Did you ever wrestle?' 'Yeah, I did.' But he doesn't talk. But I checked. This guy was a world , this guy was a champion, top, top wrestler. And when I had the top , I had all of the teams. And, by the way, your Super Bowl champions are coming, I think next week or soon. Very soon. And every one of them want to be here. (Applause.) And the coach loves us. The coach is great. Andy Reid. And every one of them want to be here. We have , people love it. But we had all of the NCAA championship teams here. They had the golf, the basketball. They had every team here. And one of the teams was wrestling. The wrestling team. Was that Penn State? And Penn State won the title. They have a great team. And I walked up with Jim, and it's like I didn't exist. (Laughter.) Those wrestlers, they grabbed him. They love Jim Jordan, and we love you too because you are some warrior. (Applause.) True. True. A woman who became a star , we have a couple of women that became stars. You two. And I always liked the name of her , you know, I liked the name, 'Lesko.' I liked it. That's how I picked it. I liked the name. I saw that face. I saw that everything. They gave me cards. She had like seven opponents, right? And you have no idea how much the public appreciates how smart, how sharp you are. This I can't tell. I can't tell. They just said, 'You know, she's really good. She's really talented.' And I said, 'Let's go.' We worked with her. She won her race. Tough race. It's no longer tough. Because what she does out there is incredible. Arizona loves her. But you were so incredible, representing , I don't say 'me' , representing our country and getting it out of this impeachment hoax. What you did was incredible. So, Debbie, please stand up. Debbie Lesko. (Applause.) A man who I , I became very friendly with , I don't know why. Do you ever have where , I'll ask the media: If certain people call, you take their calls. Other people call , if they don't have information, they won't take anybody's call. But other people call, and you don't. This is a guy , he just , he's just a very special guy. His wife I actually like better than him, to be honest. (Laughter.) Because he doesn't know that I know that he didn't actually support me right from the beginning, but she did. (Laughter.) And on my worst day , right? , on my worst day, my worst , I won't tell you why it was my worst, but it was not one of those good days , she got on a bus, got many other buses and women all over North Carolina, and they toured North Carolina. Well, Mark was back sort of semi-supporting another candidate, which he ended up leaving very quickly. I don't think you had a choice, because of your wife, but thank her. And Mark Meadows, he's an extraordinary guy. I mean, the only problem is, I guess, he's announcing , he'd only win by 40 points, but he's announcing that he'll be not running this time. Do you have somebody good to run? Somebody going to win your district by at least 20 points, please? Okay? But he's a tremendously talented man, not just as a politician. As a human being, he's incredible. And during these horrible times , I mean, the way he worked and Jim and all of you guys , the way they worked so , it was like their life was at stake. So many. Ron DeSantis is another one. He worked so hard. Then he called me. He said, 'Sir, I'd like to run for governor.' I said, 'Governor? I don't want you to run. I like you staying.' 'No, I want to run for governor.' And I said, 'Well, if you have to.' 'I'd like your support.' I said, 'How can I support you? You're at three.' He was at three. He had no money. Somebody was at 38 and they had $22 million cash, right? I said, 'Look, if it's important, I'll do it,' because they , he's been another great warrior. And he's , by the way, he ran. I endorsed him. His numbers went through the roof. The man who we beat, who was expected to win easily, called me after the race. He said, 'You endorsed him, and it was like a nuclear bomb went off. There was nothing I could do.' He never even spent his money. He saved it. But Ron DeSantis is another one, and now he's the governor of Florida. And, by the way, he's a great governor. He's a very popular governor. His numbers are in the 70s. And he's done a great job. But, Mark, I want to thank you very much. Fantastic job. Thank you very much. Mark Meadows. (Applause.) And Mike Johnson of Louisiana. Where's Mike? Central casting. What a job. You can represent me anytime. (Applause.) You can represent me anytime. Thank you. What a job you've done. Thank you, Mike. And a man nobody has ever heard of, except the other side. He's the other side's worst nightmare. This guy goes down into dungeons and basements; he'll find a document, no matter what. He's the most legitimate human being. He's the hardest worker. He's unbelievable. He took tremendous abuse. I mean, abuse. The , the media and, you know, the other side, and the bad ones, the leakers, the liars, the dirty cops , they wanted to destroy him. They tried. They got close, but he wouldn't let it happen. And, honestly, in a certain way, he was the first one. Wouldn't you say, Jim and Mark and everybody? This was the first guy. He came out of nowhere. He's saying, 'These people are corrupt.' He's still saying it. And he was unbelievable. Devin Nunes. He was unbelievable. Unbelievable. (Applause.) That's so true, Devin. He'd come in and say , I didn't even know hi;, I just heard there were like , there was this congressman who kept going into a basement , into files. (Laughter.) He knew something was wrong. You felt it, right? And now we know a lot more than we knew then, right? You never thought it was as bad as it is. And hopefully we're going to take care of things, because we can never, ever allow this to happen again. (Applause.) Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. Scott, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Scott. Really great. And you're doing very well over there, by the way. Just saw your numbers.A man who is a , I mean, central casting. If I'm going to pick Perry Mason, I'm going to do a remake of Perry Mason , other than Bill Barr, I'd pick this guy. But I have to say, I'll pick Barr. I pick Barr first, right? (Laughter.) John Ratcliffe, right? But I have to tell you, if we're doing a remake of Perry Mason, the man I get , there's nobody in Hollywood like this , John Ratcliffe, right? (Applause.) Stand up, John. So , such a great lawyer. Incredible guy. Incredible talent. But just a great lawyer and we appreciate it. He gets on that screen, and everyone says, 'I agree.' The other side folds up so fast. We'll probably be using a lot of you in the next year. But you have been fantastic, John. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. A man who's braver than me and braver than all of us in this room. He got , he got whacked. He got whacked. My Steve, right? I went to the hospital with our great First Lady that night. Right, honey? And we saw a man that was not going to make it. He was not going to make it. He was , the doctor , and I told him his wife , I said, 'She loves you.' 'Why do you say that?' Because she was devastated. A lot of wives wouldn't give a damn. (Laughter.) A lot of , a lot of wives , a lot of wives would have said, 'Oh, yeah.' I said, 'How's he doing?' 'Oh ' She couldn't even talk. She was inconsolable. Most wives would say, 'Not good. Listen, I'm going home now.' (Laughter.) But the doctor came in , the wife is like , she was a total mess. She was really devastated. And he really , it looked like he had a 20, 25 percent chance. I think you set a record for blood loss. And, Steve Scalise, I , actually, honestly, I think you're better looking now. You're more handsome now. (Laughter.) You , you weren't that good looking. You look good now. (Laughter.) He looks better now. Can you believe it? I don't know what the hell that is. (Applause.) It's true. Better now. (Applause.) What a guy. And he was practicing , he was practicing for the baseball game against, I guess, the Democrats, right? And this whack-job started shooting. Hurt Roger , I don't know if Roger is here. But hurt a number of people , hit them. But really hit Steve. He , Steve was at second base. He was the second baseman. And he went down and it was terrible. I mean, I saw the whole thing and it was terrible. Fortunately, you had two brave policemen with you. Because of your high position in Congress, you had two policemen and they were amazing , the man and a woman. And they came and they didn't have rifles. They were against a, supposedly, pretty good sharpshooter with rifles , good equipment. And all they had was a gun. And they started coming in from the outfield, shooting. And they're so far away that a handgun is not preferred. This guy has the rifle and he's hitting people. And he was going to move up and there was no out. I mean, if he would have been able to move up, there was no way to get out. The entrance was a single entranceway on the other side, where he was. So everyone went into the dugout , ran into the dugout, but Steve was really hit badly in the stomach, and , with a bullet that rips you apart. It was supposed to do that. It rips , it rips you apart. And these two people came charging forward. Boom. Boom. Boom. And one of them , you know who , one of them , him? , got the shooter. Hit him. And then got him. Killed him from the long distance. It was amazing. If you didn't have those two people , you can imagine, right? You could imagine what would happen. So Melania and I went to the hospital that night. And he was in such bad shape, and he's been working ever since, so hard. But six months ago, they had a baseball game at the Nationals Park. And I'm watching and it's , it's on television. And it's just, you know, a game. People , you want to win it, right? And Steve's at second base. The poor guy can't even walk. Do you remember Bobby Richardson for the New York Yankees? He was known for range, Louie. Range. He had the greatest range. If a ball is hit to shortstop , Bobby Richardson is the second player, the second baseman , Bobby Richardson would field the ball. If it's hit to first base, he'll throw it to the first baseman. He had unbelievable range. This was not Steve Scalise. (Laughter.) Steve had no range. (Laughter.) One foot and he has to fall down, right? Because, you know, he was trying to get better. I don't know who the hell put you on the field. (Laughter.) And this is a true story. So the game starts and the first pitch , Steve is standing at second base and the guy is really in bad shape. And I said, 'This is terrible.' A shot , groundball shot is hit to second and Steve. I say , I didn't have time to think too much, but I said, 'This is not good. That ball is going toward him.' And this guy stopped that ball, caught the call. He's now laying down. He throws the ball to first base. He gets him out. I said, 'It's the most incredible thing.' I've never seen , athletically , (applause) , I've never seen anything like it, right? And he gets him out and they then took him out of the game, which was a very wise thing because you could never do that again in a million years. (Laughter.) But you weren't going to let that ball go through. I don't care if it was hit by the greatest of all time, right? That ball was not going through you, because you are a warrior. Steve is , he is fantastic. You are fantastic. You and Liz and Kevin. What a great , what a group. I mean, what a group. I got lucky. I got lucky because you need the right people. If I had the wrong people there, he , maybe a different story. Maybe we'd be celebrating something else. But I really want to thank you, Steve Scalise. And, Elise, you , I just read this story; she's the most incredible , what's going on with you, Elise. So I even said , you know, I was up campaigning for her, helping her. But I thought, 'She looks good. She looks like good talent.' But did I not realize, when she opens that mouth, you were killing them, Elise. (Laughter.) You were killing them. (Applause.) Elise , and there's a big story in the New York Post , I love the New York Post because they treat me well. There aren't too many of you that do. But today, you're treating me well. I even had a great headline , New York Times, Washington Post. I had all of these great headlines. Maybe we should just end it right there. (Laughter.) But you had the greatest story, yesterday in the Post, that people from all over the country are contributing to her campaign. They were so enthralled with the way you handled yourself, what you said, the way you said it. And I'll always be your friend. I think it was , it's really an amazing story. What a great future you have. What a great future. Thank you. (Applause.) The First Lady agrees, by the way. The First Lady agrees. And Michael Turner, you can represent me anytime. Where's Michael? Where is he? (Applause.) Or you can represent me. How good were you? There's another , there's another Perry Mason type, I think. Right? What do you think, John? But, Michael, you were fantastic and we appreciate it. Brad Wenstrup. Where's Brad? Brad. (Applause.) Great, great job. This is a big day for lawyers. You notice only the lawyers stayed? All the lawyers stayed behind. Lee Zeldin. How good are you? How good are you? (Applause.) Man. And, Louie, your name is not down. They didn't give me your name. Do you know , if I didn't announce Louie , (laughter) , whoever the hell made this list, I got to get rid of because I , if I wouldn't have announced Louie, it might have been the end of the presidency. (Laughter.) Louie, you have been so great. So tough and so smart. I got it just , (laughs) , I got it. But Louie has been amazing. He's a tough guy. He's a smart guy. He's streetwise like crazy. We love Texas, and we're with you all the way, Louie. We're with you all the way. Thank you very much. (Applause.) So that's the story. We have a great group of warriors, and there are others left, and, I guess, probably, I'm sure I didn't mention a few, and I apologize if that's the case. How's CPAC doing? Good? Huh? My man, stand up please, will you? He's the one who said, 'You should run.' (Applause.) Right? Matt said , it's like five years ago, six years ago. And I made a speech, and then they do some kind of a straw poll: 'Who made the best speech?' And he said, 'I made the best speech.' With all this professional , I hate to say this: With all these professional politicians, they voted, by far, the best speech was Trump. He calls me, he says, 'You should run for politics.' I say, 'What do I know about politics?' But you know what? We learned quickly, and our country has never done better than it's doing right now. (Applause.) So it's been good. (Applause.) But thank you, Matt. Great. Say hello. So that's the story. We've been treated very unfairly. Fortunately, we have great men and women that came to our defense. If we didn't, this would have been a horrific incident for our country. When you have Lisa and Peter, the lovers, the FBI lovers: 'I want to believe the path you threw out for' Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. That's the office. 'There's no way he gets elected' , meaning me. 'There's no way he gets elected.' This is Peter, to Lisa. He's probably trying to impress her, for obvious reasons. (Laughter.) 'There's no way he gets elected. But I'm afraid we can't take the risk.' Now, think of this. In other words, if I get elected, they can't , 'they'; two low-lifes , they can't take the risk. They can't take the risk. Think of it. And that's where it came up, the greatest word of all: 'insurance policy.' So he says, 'But I'm afraid we can't take the risk. She may lose.' It's like an insurance policy. In the unlikely event you die before you're 40 , in other words, if I won, they were going to do exactly what they did to us. They were going to try and overthrow the government of the United States , a duly elected president. And if I didn't fire James Comey, we would have never found this stuff. Because when I fired that sleazebag, all hell broke out. They were ratting on each other. They were running for the hills. Let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. It's in the hands of some very talented people. We're going to have to see what happens. But I can tell you, in my opinion, these are the crookedest, most dishonest, dirtiest people I've ever seen. They said , this is Strzok: 'God, Hillary should win 100 million to one.' This is about me. This is an agent from the FBI. Look how they let her off. Thirty-three thousand emails deleted. Nothing happens to her. Nothing happens. It's unbelievable. But think of that , 'God, Hillary should win' , when these guys are investigating Hillary. Then they go to work for Mueller , the two of them , and when Muller found out that everybody knew that they were 100 percent this way, he let them go. But they deleted all of their emails and text messages. So when we got the phone, they were all deleted. Could you imagine the treasure trove? They illegally deleted. So they left. They left Bob Mueller. He had the look, but he didn't have a lot of other things. Always had the look. Mr. G-Man. And I love the FBI and the FBI loves me , 99 percent. It was the top scum. And the FBI people don't like the top scum. So think of that: 100 million to one. And he's investigating me. And then, 'God, Trump is a loathsome human being, isn't he?' These are the people looking at me. I'm really not a bad person. And Page said, 'Yes, he's awful.' How would you like to have that? This is just , this is the good stuff. There's stuff a hundred times worse than that. These are all dirty people. And now, I just heard that they're suing the United States of America because they were interfered with. We're not going to let it happen. Just not going to let it happen. We cannot let this happen to our country. We can't. (Applause.) So, I'm going to leave now. And I don't know if any of you have anything to say. You could say it. But this is sort of a day of celebration, because we went through hell. And I'm sure that Pelosi and Cryin' Chuck , I've known this guy all the , the only time I ever saw him cry was when it was appropriate. Known him for a long time. Cryin' Chuck. But I'm sure they'll try and cook up other things. They'll go through the state of New York. They'll go through other places. They'll do whatever they can. Because instead of wanting to heal our country and fix our country, all they want to do , in my opinion, it's almost like they want to destroy our country. We can't let it happen. Jim Jordan, did you want to say something? Go ahead. Huh? Mark? Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) This was a highly partisan situation. Pelosi said , I copied it down exactly. Before the impeachment , she wanted to impeach from day one, by the way. Don't let it fool you. You know, she said, 'No, the impeachment is a very serious thing.' I said, 'She wants to impeach. Watch.' Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan , bipartisan. It was 197 to nothing. And other than one failed presidential candidate , and I call that 'half a vote' because he actually voted for us on the other one. But we had one failed presidential candidate. That's the only half a vote we lost. So, we had almost 53 to nothing. We had 197 to nothing. And the only one that voted against was a guy that can't stand the fact that he ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of the presidency. But she said, 'There's something so compelling , it has to be so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan. I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country' , she was right about that , 'and it's just not worth it.' That was Nancy Pelosi a year ago. Right? And I think it's a shame. I think it's a shame. But as I said, if we can put this genius to work on roads and highways and bridges and all of the things we can do , prescription drugs. You know, we had , Secretary Azar is here and I want to thank him for this, but we had , first time in 51 years, where drug prices actually came down last year. First time in 51 years. But what we can do, working with both parties in Congress, is , would be unbelievable. It would be unbelievable , all we can do. And I know Chuck Grassley is working very hard on it and Mitch is working very hard on it. But what we can do is , is incredible. What we can do, just generally. We've done so much without it. We've rebuilt our military. We've cut regulations at a level that nobody thought possible. We'll always protect our Second Amendment; we all know that. But I just want to tell you that it's an honor to be with you all. I want to apologize to my family for having them have to go through a phony, rotten deal by some very evil and sick people. And Ivanka is here, and my , my sons and my whole family, and that includes Barron. (Applause.) That includes Barron, who is up there as a young boy. Stand up, honey. (Applause.) Ivanka, thank you, honey. Come. Come. (Applause.) (The President hugs Ivanka Trump.) Come here, baby. (Applause.) (The President hugs the First Lady.) So I just want to thank my family for sticking through it. This was not part of the deal. I was going to run for President, and if I won, I was going do a great job. I didn't know that I was going to run, and then when I got in, I was going to have to run again and again and again. Every week, I had to run again. That wasn't the deal, but they stuck with me. And I'm so glad I did it because we are making progress and doing things for our great people that everybody said couldn't be done. Our country is thriving. Our country is just respected again. And it's an honor to be with the people in this room. Thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)",

         "Signed into law on January 1, 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires Federal agencies to consider and inform the public of the environmental effects of proposed major Federal actions. NEPA's enactment was the culmination of legislative efforts to establish a national environmental policy and incorporate the consideration of environmental issues into the Federal Government's decision-making processes. Today, on the 50th anniversary of this milestone legislation, we take the opportunity to reflect upon NEPA's goals of protecting our Nation's natural resources and recommit to ensuring a safe, healthy, and productive environment for all Americans. From commuting to work or school and turning on lights at home to having access to clean, reliable drinking water, the daily activities of all of our citizenry are affected by NEPA's requirements. Many projects involving the construction of roads, bridges, highways, airports, transmission lines, conventional and renewable energy projects, broadband deployment, and water infrastructure, as well as management activities on public lands, such as grazing, forest management, wildfire protection, and environmental restoration projects, must undergo Federal environmental review before they can proceed. While the goals of NEPA remain the same as they did 50 years ago, the environmental review process designed to improve decision making has become increasingly complex and difficult to navigate. Project sponsors and ordinary Americans seeking decisions on permits from the Federal Government can face significant uncertainty and delays that can increase costs, derail important projects, and threaten jobs for American workers and labor union members. To improve Federal agency coordination and make environmental reviews and permitting processes far less time-consuming, I directed Federal agencies to implement a One Federal Decision policy for major infrastructure projects. Under this policy, agencies are working to complete environmental reviews within 2 years. Additionally, I directed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to modernize the Federal environmental review and decision-making process. As a result, CEQ has conducted a thorough review of its NEPA implementing regulations and will soon issue a proposal to update those regulations to address the many concerns my Administration has heard from hardworking Americans, small businesses, and State and local officials. Moreover, my Administration is delivering on my promise to continue cutting burdensome regulations and has issued almost eight deregulatory actions for every one new regulation imposed over the past 3 years, helping unleash the full potential of America's economy. My Administration remains committed to improving the environmental review and permitting process while ensuring environmental protection. This will benefit our economy and environment while also enhancing the quality of life for current and future generations of Americans. Today, we celebrate NEPA's 50th anniversary and its role in protecting our environment as we look forward to improving its implementation for the 21st century.",

BUT HE SAID, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK, AND HE MEANT IT. IT TOOK HIM THREE YEARS TO MOVE TO DELAWARE AND GET US A HOUSE TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN, BUT HE WAS CONFIDENT IT WOULD BE OK. BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE TODAY ARE ABLE TO LOOK THEIR CHILDREN AND THE EYE FACED WITH THAT KIND OF CRISIS AND SAY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK? THEY DON'T THINK IT IS GOING TO BE OK, BECAUSE WE HAVE MADE IT SO MUCH HARDER IN THIS COUNTRY UNDER THIS PRESIDENT, THAT IT WON'T MAKE IT OK. JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, 12 HOURS AGO, JILL AND I AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN STOOD IN LINE IN MANCHESTER FOR FOOD FOR CHILDREN, BITTERLY COLD, 22 DEGREES, THE WIND BLOWING, AND YOU SEE ALL THESE LITTLE CHILDREN STANDING IN LINE, HUDDLED, NO GLOVES, PHRASING, FREEZING, WAITING TO PICK UP A CARDBOARD BOX SO THEY CAN PUT BREAD IN IT, DOUGHNUTS IN IT, THINGS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET FOR FOOD, AND IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A WOMAN WITH BARELY A SWEATER ON HOLDING HER CHILD TIGHTLY IN TEARS COMING DOWN HER EYES AS SHE PICKED UP BREAD. THE MEN WHO CAME ALONG, UNABLE TOJUST THINKING, THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HOW CAN THAT BE HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN THE BITTER COLD WITH NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO. JUST GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF SUSTENANCE. ONE OF THE GUYS WALKED UP AND GAVE ME A SCHOOL CAP. WHY DO I HAVE IT? I GAVE IT TO ONE OF THE KIDS. THINK ABOUT IT. NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A LINE THAT LASTED AND LASTED AND LASTED. NO HOPE IN SIGHT FOR THESE PEOPLE. THIS IS NOT THE AMERICA ANY OF US GREW UP IN, THAT WE BELIEVE IN. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THE OTHER DAY, THREE DAYS AGO, WHAT HAPPENED? I WAS BEING INTRODUCED IN CLAREMONT, I BELIEVE IT WAS. A GUY, A WOMAN IS GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU. HER NAME WAS CHRISTIE. SHE LOOKED AT ME. SHE SAID, I WILL TELL MY STORY. SHE WAS A VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN VICTIM, BEATEN BY HER HUSBAND. SHE SAID SHE WAS ON THE STREET WITH A LITTLE BABY. NOWHERE TO GO. SHE PICKED UP A PAPER AND SHE LOOKED DOWN AND SAID, I DON'T KNOW THIS GUY. HE'S WRITING THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. HE WILL FIND ME A HOUSE AND HOME. GUESS WHAT? IT SAVED HER LIFE. SHE HAD MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ABUSE. THAT IMPACT ON HER CHILD, IT GOT HER OFF THE STREET. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHILDREN ON THE STREET ARE THERE BECAUSE THEIR MOTHERS ARE BEING ABUSED AND BATTERED. HOW MANY OF THEM ARE SUFFERING FROM POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS WITH US DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT? THE ACT I WROTE IS SITTING IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE NOT BEING PASSED BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GIVE THE BOYFRIENDS GUNS. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS. THIS IS WHY WE ARE ALL RUNNING, EVERYONE OF US. THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IT'S NOT ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE OTHER WAY. FOLKS, WE ARE BEING LED BY A PRESIDENT WHO HAS NO EMPATHY, NO SYMPATHY, WHO MOCKS PEOPLE, WHO MAKES FUN OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, WHO DOES EVERYTHING HE CAN TO BE MEAN. HE DOESN'T HAVE A SHRED OF DECENCY AND HIM. HE SPEAKS TO WOMEN IN SUCH DEGRADING TERMS. THAT'S NOT HOW YOU WERE RAISED HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THAT'S NOT HOW I WAS RAISED. THAT'S NOT THE AMERICA ANY OF US KNOW. IT DOESN'T REPRESENT NEW HAMPSHIRE VALUES EITHER. I LOST A LOT IN MY LIFETIME LIKE YOU HAVE. I LOST MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. I LOST MY SON TO A LONG BATTLE WITH BRAIN CANCER. I WON'T STAND BY AND LOSE THIS ELECTION TO THIS MAN. WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. THE CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY IS ON THE BALLOT. WE MUST DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. THERE IS NO CHOICE. THE MAN DOES NOT HAVE A SHRED OF DECENCY. WE HAVE TO STAND UP AGAINST BIGOTRY, HATRED, THE ABUSE OF POWER. THIS MAN DERIVES PEOPLE. IT'S UP TO YOU, AMERICA. ONLY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CAN DO IT. WE MUST DO IT NOW. STAND UP, TAKE IT BACK.

         "Thank you all. Thank you for that warm welcome back to Heritage Foundation, which throughout the course of my public life, and back in my days in Indiana when I formed a small think tank to focus on state issues , Kay, I have to be honest with you, Heritage Foundation will always feel like home. And I thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome. (Applause.) To the members of Congress who join us here today , great leaders on Capitol Hill; distinguished guests; ambassadors; and to all of you who, every day, are working in these hallways and oftentimes on the airwaves of America, building a nation and freedom, opportunity, and prosperity, and civil society flourish, it is an honor to be here today with each and every one of you. And while I'm grateful for that kind introduction, would you all just join me in thanking someone whose life and career are synonymous with the conservative movement? She's been a champion of the American Dream, and now she leads the Heritage Foundation with great distinction. Kay Coles James, thank you. (Applause.) Please, stand up and take a bow. It really is great to be back. You know, three years ago, I spoke to Heritage Foundation as Vice President-elect. And I remember at the time, Kay, that you warned me that the White House has a tendency to turn people prematurely gray. (Laughter.) But, honestly, I haven't changed a bit. (Laughter.) You know, the Heritage Foundation is a flagship of freedom. Since its founding in 1973, Heritage has been advancing conservative public policy based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, traditional values, and, from its very founding, focused on a strong national defense. And now for nearly half a century, it's undeniable the Heritage Foundation has made a difference for America. (Applause.) And allow me to bring greetings from a great fan of Heritage Foundation, and a great champion of all the ideals and values that are synonymous with this great institution. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, as I told Heritage Foundation three years ago, when I gathered with each and every one of you, when President-elect was preparing to enter office, we believed then that our President had won a mandate for leadership and he'd make good use of it. Our transition office went right to work the morning after the election. The truth is, I'll never forget the night of Election Night, it was all called in, the President had gotten the phone call. We gave the speeches at the podium. It was about 4:30 in the morning. And as we were leaving the hotel, I'll never forget the President-elect looked at me and he said, 'I'll tell you what , it's been a long night. Let's not get started until 8:30 tomorrow morning.' (Laughter.) And when I got to the office, he was already at his desk. But we went right to work, taking the policies that the President-elect had campaigned on , the policies that the Heritage Foundation had advanced for decades , and worked to build a team to put them into practice. And let me acknowledge one of our helpful volunteers on our transition team who played a vital role in assembling a team that's been making America great again ever since. Would join me in thanking my friend, Dr. Ed Feulner, who's with us today and has played such a vital role , (applause) , yesterday, today, and tomorrow for freedom. Thank you, Ed. (Applause.) Great job. Now, we are gathered here today to talk about trade and economic growth. The Heritage Foundation has long understood that to provide for the common defense is the first object of the federal government. And I'm proud to report to all of you gathered here that, from the first days of this administration, under President Trump's leadership, we've been working to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. Just last month, President Trump completed a budget deal that secured $738 billion for our military. And that'll represent the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We've rebuilt our military. We've restored the arsenal of democracy. And with the strong and unwavering support of these very same members of Congress and all those they represent, we are finally again giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources they need to accomplish their mission and keep our nation safe. (Applause.) So, thank you all. And with that renewed American strength, our armed forces have taken the fight to our enemies on our terms, on their soil. We secured freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. We brought North Korea to the negotiating table. And our armed forces captured the last inch of territory controlled by the ISIS caliphate earlier this year. (Applause.) But the truth is, as President Trump has observed, 'Our active-duty personnel are now the best-equipped, best-trained, and most technologically advanced fighting force in the history of the world.' And in the wake of this weekend's unprovoked attack on several oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, I promise you: We're ready. As the President said, we 'don't want war with anybody,' but the United States is prepared. We're locked and loaded. And we're ready to defend our interests and our allies in the region , make no mistake about it. As the President said yesterday, it's 'certainly looking like' Iran was behind these attacks. And our intelligence community, at this very hour, is working diligently to review the evidence. And the Secretary of State is traveling to Saudi Arabia today to discuss our response. But if the attacks were initiated from Iran, the truth is they would just be the latest in a series of increasingly dangerous escalations instigated by the Islamic Republic. In the past few months alone, the Iranian regime has deployed their regional proxies to stage sabotage attacks against shipping in the Persian Gulf. They've supplied and trained their Houthi allies in Yemen to launch nearly 100 drone strikes against Saudi targets. And, in July, they openly exceeded the limits to their stockpile of low-enriched uranium that they agreed to in 2015. Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world, and it's the greatest threat to peace and security in the Middle East. That's why President Trump withdrew from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal and initiated a maximum pressure campaign against the regime in Tehran. And the truth is, our maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime is working. But know this: If Iran conducted this latest attack to pressure President Trump to back off, they will fail. America is ready to defend our interests. And because of the President's strong action to advance American energy independence, we're also less vulnerable today to threats to the global oil supply than ever before. This year, the United States will actually become a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years. (Applause.) And the President has authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as needed, to keep energy markets well supplied, and he's also directed appropriate agencies to expedite approval of oil pipelines. These attacks against our allies and the global energy supply will fail. But as I close on this point, let me say we're evaluating all the evidence. We're consulting with our allies. And the President will determine the best course of action in the days ahead. But I promise you, under President Donald Trump, America will maintain our energy dominance, we will maintain our momentum toward energy independence. And the United States of America will take whatever action is necessary to defend our country, our troops, and our allies in the Gulf. You can count on it. (Applause.) So we've been standing strong for our military and the national defense. But on this Constitution Day, I'm proud to report that we've also been standing strong for the Constitution itself, for the principles of limited government, for the values enshrined in our founding documents. You know, the Heritage Foundation has always been a bulwark of traditional values. And as I stand before you today, I couldn't be more proud to serve as Vice President to a President who stands without apology for the unalienable right to life. (Applause.) In one of the President's first acts in office, he reinstituted the Mexico City Policy to make sure that American tax dollars would not be used to promote or provide abortion around the world. And we've expanded it in recent days. And I don't know if I've had a higher honor, as President of the Senate, the day I cast the deciding vote to allow states across America to defund Planned Parenthood. (Applause.) But as we've stood for the unalienable right to life, the President also stood strong for the constitutional foundation of our courts. And I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to pay one more debt of gratitude and boundless admiration to a man who has been a champion of our Constitution, a champion of the values and ideals that have made this nation great throughout its long and storied career. Would you all join me in thanking Attorney General Ed Meese for all he has done for America? (Applause.) Thank you, General. General Meese will be glad to know , and he's been a great counselor on this point , that, as a candidate, our President promised to appoint strict constructionists to our federal courts at every level in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia. And that's just what he's done. And I'm proud to report, in the last two and a half years, President Trump has appointed 150 federal judges to our courts, and they're all conservatives who are committed to upholding the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, including the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) We're making historic progress, strengthening the constitutional foundation of our courts through the appointments this President has made and will continue to make. But Democrats and their allies in the media are obviously getting desperate. After dominating our courts for more than a generation, leading Democrats today are now openly calling for packing the Court. And this week, they've even taken to smearing a sitting justice on the Supreme Court of the United States with discredited allegations. The calls by Democrat candidates for president to remove Justice Kavanaugh from the Court are a disgrace and nothing short of an attack on our independent judiciary. Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a good and decent man, he is a principled jurist and a credit to the highest court in the land, and these attacks on Justice Kavanaugh must stop. (Applause.) So we've been standing strong for our national defense, for the rule of law, and for our values. But under this President, we've also been taking action to get this economy moving again, which brings us here today , one more opportunity to add even more momentum to an American economy that is booming. The truth is, from day one, we've been putting into practice the very principles that Heritage Foundation has stood for since its founding in 1973: lower taxes, less regulation, more American energy, and greater individual liberty. From the early days of this administration, President Trump has rolled back red tape at a historic level. In fact, this President has signed more laws cutting federal red tape already than any President in American history, saving more than $33 billion in regulatory costs. We've also unleashed American energy. This President withdrew America from the disastrous Paris Climate Accord. And today, the United States, as I mentioned, is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And, of course, it wasn't just rolling back regulations and unleashing American energy. This President kept his promise in the early days of this administration when he signed into law the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. (Applause.) In fact, businesses saw a corporate tax rate reduction from one of the highest in the industrialized world to 21 percent. It was the largest percentage point reduction in the top marginal corporate rate in the history of this country. We also cut taxes for working families. We doubled the child tax credit. We doubled the standard deduction. And now the typical family of four is saving about $2,000 a year. The result of all of that , less regulation, less taxes, more American energy , has truly been remarkable. As I stand here today at the Heritage Foundation, I'm proud to report, since Election Day, businesses large and small across this country have created more than 6 million new jobs, and the unemployment rate has hit a 50-year low. (Applause.) In two and a half short years, more than 7 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. And wages are rising at their fastest pace in more than 10 years. In fact, the average worker has seen their wages go up by more than $1,000 in the last year alone. The economy is soaring. And you really , you don't need to hear it by studying statistics. These congressmen will attest we hear it on the street every single day. I had that happen myself when Karen and I slipped away down to the Fort Myers area for a couple of days on the beach earlier this year. We were sitting there in our ball caps and our sunglasses taking in a few enjoyable hours of rest there on the beach, and these two fellas came walking by wearing big Budweiser t-shirts. And one of them stopped and turned to me and he said, 'Hey, you're Vice President Mike Pence.' (Laughter.) And I said, 'Yes, I am.' (Laughter.) And he looked at me and he said, 'Well, listen, you got to tell the President that he's got to keep doing what he's doing because I made twice as much money last year as I did the year before.' And I told him I'd tell the President word for word. And I did it. (Applause.) It's true. And then he took three steps away, and he turned back, and looked at me and he said, 'Now, I don't know what you do, but keep doing what you're doing too.' (Laughter.) I told him I would. (Laughter.) I mean, the truth is, we're here today , we're here today because of the tremendous progress that we've made. But I'm also here today to talk about a great opportunity , an opportunity before us to build on the momentum that we've seen in this economy. I'm here today to call on the Congress of the United States to pass the largest trade deal in American history. It's time for Congress to pass the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement. (Applause.) You know, this President was no fan of NAFTA. He often reflected on the campaign trail what I saw back in the state of Indiana, about the impact , unintentional or otherwise , that NAFTA had on many communities, many factories across the country that had closed in the last quarter century. But he promised that we could do better. He promised that we'd sit down with Mexico and Canada and negotiate a new deal that would put , that put jobs and prosperity first. And he did just that. Now, I got to tell you, I was in on a lot of those discussions with President Obrador's predecessor and with Prime Minister Trudeau in Canada. I saw this President drive a hard bargain, but I also saw our neighbors to the north and the south negotiate in good faith. So let me take this opportunity to not only thank Mexico and Canada, but let me also give you a chance to join me in thanking their representatives who are with us today: The Ambassador of Canada to the United States of America, Kirsten Hillman, and Mexico's Ambassador to the United States, Martha B�rcena. Would you stand up and let us show you how much we appreciate your efforts? (Applause.) Thank you. The truth is, as you all know here at the Heritage Foundation, since the early post-war era, America's prosperity has rested on the ingenuity, the determination, the hard work of the American people. But it's also , also rested on robust trade with freedom-loving nations around the world. It was a landmark free trade agreement, after all, that helped revive the global economy after the Second World War. In 1947, the United States and 22 other nations came together to forge an agreement that leveled the playing field for American businesses. It actually laid a foundation for decades of economic growth. It's called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. And early on, it worked. It worked to create prosperity in this country and really helped the world recover from the devastations of war. Tariffs in industrialized countries fell an average of 40 percent to around 5 percent today. But, frankly, today, as we've negotiated trade agreements among so many different countries with so many different interests, too many countries around the world, in the decades that have followed, have taken advantage of the United States in the process, often to the detriment of hardworking Americans. And President Trump, as a candidate and as your President, has called them out and demanded that we put American jobs and American workers first. The truth is, though, one administration after another stood by and watched unfair trade practices hollow out American manufacturing in particular. This President promised to fight for American jobs and American workers. Three years ago, the businessman-turned-candidate said that, 'No longer will we enter into these massive trade deals with many countries that are thousands of pages long, that no one from any country reads or understands.' And he's demanded that we move forward. We withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We signed up the toughest and smartest trade negotiators we've ever had to crack down on China's unfair trade practices and negotiate new trade deals with our partners around the world. We've ended the era of economic surrender. And we're using the power of the strongest economy in the history of the world to put our jobs and our workers first. And now, American jobs and American workers are winning again. You know, I remember when the last administration lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. And, literally, the last President said that those jobs were gone for good, remember? He said, what are you going to , 'You got a magic wand to bring them back?' Well, we didn't need a magic wand; we just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. We've seen 500,000 manufacturing jobs created since Election Day alone. (Applause.) The truth is, we've been working hard to open up markets around the world to goods and services: Argentina to American pork, Vietnam to American grain, the European Union to American beef. And time after time, as our friends from Canada and Mexico can attest, the President has been calling for free and fair and reciprocal trade, driving a hard bargain to open up markets to countries that have access to the American consumer. And since we took office, the President pursued an ambitious trade agenda that's been built on those principles of free and fair and reciprocal trade. We dramatically improved our trade agreement with South Korea. Three years ago, we reached an agreement in principle on a first stage. Just a few months ago, the first stage of a free trade agreement with Japan. Two weeks ago, I told Prime Minister Boris Johnson that the United States is ready to immediately begin negotiations on a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom as soon as Brexit is complete. And we're ready. (Applause.) Beyond all that, this President put China on notice that the decades of massive trade deficits, intellectual property theft, and forced technology transfer , the decades of China ignoring the rules of international commerce , are over. But I came here today to talk about why it's absolutely vital for Congress pass the USMCA. According to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA will add nearly $70 billion in investments in this country and create nearly 180,000 American jobs just in the early going. In total, American exports to Canada, we believe that we'll see increases by $19 billion, and exports to Mexico will increase by $14 billion. And while NAFTA passed before even dial-up Internet, the brand new Digital Trade Chapter of the USMCA contains the strongest language on digital trade of any international agreement in history. And the USMCA will be a big win for American energy as well. Canada and Mexico are the top two destinations for American oil, already receiving nearly 30 percent of our exports. And that number will only increase under the USMCA. It will keep Mexico's energy resources open to development by American companies, and it will guarantee no tariffs on American oil. The USMCA also levels the playing field for American workers and American jobs. Under the USMCA, 75 percent of auto parts in duty-free cars must be made right here in North America, and a significant portion of these parts must be made by workers making a base wage of at least $16 per hour. We believe that this will eliminate the historic incentive to move manufacturing jobs out of the United States of America. President Donald Trump is putting American jobs and American workers first. (Applause.) And I know we're all watching as the news between the UAW and General Motors , the strike that began yesterday. But I have a respectful message for all the United Auto Workers who are currently on strike. As the President said, we hope and trust you'll work out your differences with GM. But while you're at it, if you really want to support our nation's auto workers, the UAW and GM ought to tell Congress to pass the USMCA and make sure there's more autoworkers jobs for decades to come. (Applause.) So the record is clear: The USMCA is a win. It's a win for American energy. It's a win for American agriculture. It's a win for American manufacturing. As I stand before you today, I'm proud to report the President has done his job. Canada and Mexico are doing their job. Now we need Congress to do its job and pass the USMCA. And it's more than just a good deal between our three countries. Experts often reflect that the USMCA is so advanced, it's so comprehensive that, it may well serve as a template , a model trade agreement , for future trade agreements in the decades ahead, whether with the United Kingdom, Japan, the European Union, or even China. And by passing the USMCA, it will also strengthen the President's hand in the negotiations with that last country. By bringing North America together, by demonstrating our ability to unify our economy with our neighbors to the north and the south, it will only strengthen the President's hand as we demand that China end the trade abuses that have characterized the decades of the past. The USMCA will further strengthen our economy and create jobs at a time when other economies around the world are slowing. And it's an idea whose time has come. So I promise you: We're going to keep fighting. We're going to keep fighting for American jobs, for American opportunities, and we're going to keep fighting to get the USMCA across the line. But I came here today to the Heritage Foundation because all of you know that the greatest force this country has ever known, that has the greatest impact on the future of this nation, is always the voice of the American people. And so I want to encourage all the leaders in this room to let your voice be heard. Leave here today and do like I'm going to do: Head straight to Capitol Hill and tell the Congress to pass the USMCA for America. (Applause.) If all of us do all we can to let our voice be heard, I promise you we'll get the USMCA done, and I believe we can get it done this year. So it's great to be with all of you today at the Heritage Foundation. I thank you for coming out. I look around this room and feel like I'm watching cable television. (Laughter.) There's so many well-known faces and voices here, I'm actually very honored that you would take time to hear us out. And to come here to be part of the Heritage Foundation's long tradition of being a platform talking about how we advance the agenda and the principles that have made this country great in the past and are making America great again as we speak. I mean, the truth is, Heritage Foundation has been a bulwark. It's been a bulwark of freedom and a leading defender of the Constitution now for almost a half a century. And as I end here today, I can't help but think about the fact that it's Constitution Day; that more than two centuries ago, on this day, the Constitution was signed. And later on today, I will have the great privilege of participating in a Naturalization Ceremony with a room full of new Americans who will come to the White House to swear their allegiance to this country and swear their oath to that Constitution of the United States. But I think of the preamble of that Constitution on a day like today, and of all the years that have passed since, the words the Constitution began with that, 'We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution the United States of America.' When they walked out of that hall in Philadelphia, history records that a little old lady walked up to Benjamin Franklin, asked him what kind of government they had created. And he said, it's 'a republic, if you can keep it.' And as I stand before you today, I have a grateful heart not just as your Vice President, but as an American, that we've kept it. We've kept it. We looked at that charge and that preamble. And all of the things that I addressed today give evidence to the fact that the American people, whatever our differences are, we have kept faith with the ideals enshrined in that Constitution. And I believe it's a day of cause for celebration and one that we ought to reflect on and be thankful for, but redouble our commitment today to stand by that Constitution, to stand by those ideals, because it's always been the wellspring of our nation's greatness. And as we keep faith with that Constitution and with the American people, I know , as people at Heritage Foundation have known for nearly 50 years , that the best days for the greatest nation on Earth are yet to come. So thank you. God bless you. God bless the Heritage Foundation. (Applause.) And God bless America. (Applause.)",

You know it's amazing we knocked out a big portion of what he did including the wonderful mandate right the individual mandate in Obamacare which totally by the way by far the worst of all of Obamacare we didn't get out the centrally that ended Obamacare and then you say so we knocked out 84 percent of what he did they say he was. Wonderful president why was he a wonderful president if we knocked out and the very popular way not doubt 84 percent the voters of Wisconsin face a simple joys. If you want to be ruled by the radical left or do you want as then tall as free men and women in the greatest country on earth and keep it that way. Was you want to crush our economy under the crazy socialist policies of sleepy Joe Biden And his boss Harris come on. And is not the boss then see Pelosi she's a beauty And is ruler Bernie Sanders crazy. Or do you want to quickly rebuild the strongest economy in the history of the world which we did we're going to have to do it again we're going to have to do it again and we're in the process of doing. We've built the greatest economy on Earth and that we're doing it again you look at all the numbers we're going to go over and you wanted to fund and defame and dismantle the police I don't think so. You want to support the incredible heroes of law enforcement Yes right the laws . You want your friends and family to be persecuted by the far left wing it's called Ted so cold your. Right hand still culture or do you want to defend our history our heroes our faith our values and our treasured American way of life which is what we have laws right thank God I don't believe the lies you're going to hear on tape most is going to be that I wonder is Joe Biden taping his speech too because if he is I think I'll take mine. How do you why. It's a taped they talk about a convention how do you watch a tape speech I would imagine Joe is going to do everything he can today but I saw them asking him questions today it was a news conference and you read him of a teleprompter I don't get it I don't get it something going on up there. We can afford it you know I can tell you this look from doing this now we've got the greatest economy in the world we rebuilt our military we gave you the greatest tax cuts for the greatest regulations. We became energy independent we've done things that nobody thought possible right nobody thought possible we've done things that nobody ever thought you had the greatest year in the history of your state list the greatest here last and when you look at the numbers you're going to have an even greater year next year unless somebody comes in and quadruples your taxes in which case it's called the depression folks it's called a depression it's not going to happen because we're going to win . The war . Biden is just a Trojan horse for socialism he is he's a Trojan horse he has no clue but the people around him a tough and they're smart but we disagree with them very very strongly there mean and they're angry like her by the way nobody treated Joe Biden worse than Kemal right she was worse than Pocahontas she was worse than anybody and say nobody treated him worse or with I mean less respect she had no respect all of a sudden she's now saying is the wonderful she didn't feel that way a little while ago let's talk about her for a 2nd she left in shame she started her 14 she left to do she went in the wrong direction so if that's if a poll is any any indication that's what we want speak it a Polls fake do c.n.n. they probably have their camera going thank you very. Much No no no we have to frankly their poster is much better than Fox because Fox has never gotten it right Vox postered I don't know who he is but he hasn't had a clue for about 7 years let me just let me just tell you that c.n.n. gave us an increase of 10 or 11 points in just a short period of time that we won up and now they call it margin of error don't believe it we're way beyond the margin of error I don't lawyer. I just got back from Texas. And Florida. And Ohio we were all over the place we were we went to great states and every road way highway we had thousands tens of thousands I would say at least on each 100000 people from the plane because you know that's why this isn't a rally this is again friendly protest we were not allowed to do rallies right because of rules and regulations which we want to adhere to but from the plane to an oil well from the plane to getting law enforcement all of the sheriffs in Florida gave us their full endorsement right laws. And in Ohio we went to a plant whirlpool there were at a business there were going out of business and now they're thriving company because they were dumping washing machines and dryers into our country and I stopped it and I said you want to do that we're putting a massive tariff and all of a sudden whirlpool and thousands of people there work at Ohio and other places it became a really terrific company again and we went there but if you look if you look at the kind of enthusiasm we have we have never had the enthusiasm that we have right now and that includes 2016. And I hate to say it and I don't want to be rude because I would never be rude but let me just tell you. Joe Biden has no enthusiasm. No enthusiasm and you don't win without enthusiasm like people aren't saying we got to get him and the only reason they want him in is they want to stop our great agenda that's the only reason that's the only thing is going and nobody wins when you're not on the side of enthusiasm so we have more than we ever had in 2016 and in 2016 nobody has ever see the campaign with that kind of enthusiasm and we have much for our Earth at the socialist will not stop until they've ransacked America and laid waste to our cities your eyes don't lie look at Portland it's been turned into a war zone and we want to go in and solve it we save the courthouse you believe it we had to send in homeland security they were great they easily saved it after was pounded Portland was supposed to be watching it but they weren't so we said to men and we will send in the National Guard just like we did in Minnesota you saw what happened there Minneapolis the National Guard went in within 15 minutes all thing was over they should have called them in a week earlier . Oh thank my beautiful beautiful 5th Avenue in New York has been looted and pillaged it was allowed to happen by an incompetent mare that doesn't have a clue look at what's happened to our dime in New York was a diamond for the country look how far it's gone down in Chicago the mayor literally raised up the drawbridge is to prevent hordes of rioters from ransacking the city can you believe it can you believe 17 officers were injured in Chicago. They had a week a little while ago during a weekend spree where 78 people were shot and 18 died that's worse than Afghanistan which we're getting out of that's worse than Iraq which were almost out of that's worse than Syria which were out of step we kept the oil but that's Ok we have to talk about. God thank God this is the future the Joe Biden plans to bring to every city town and suburb in the nation and you know for those suburbs I keep hearing about suburban women made me. Was Well you know in one speech recently I called you suburban housewives and they all loved it but what I got they censor I don't know if that's politically correct I said don't worry about it they'll get over it right but we say. We save the suburbs the suburbs and you know what I'm talking about and they said about the rule it's a rule very strong it's like a law they said sir we can amend it I said I don't want it amended No we can really amended bring it down no I don't want to I wanted terminated and we terminated it it's gone way and it will be reinstituted if Joe Biden comes and not by him because he has no idea what the law says or what it means but by the people that will be running our country it will not be him it will not be him running our country they will turn every city into a Portland and they wouldn't mind no one will be safe it is a Biden run America but was president the United States will use every tool and we've done it by the way our country is doing great we have the pandemic sure the never been allowed to the never been allowed to happen by Johnny not to the never been allowed to happen. They released it they didn't release it in China but it came to the United States and Europe $188.00 all over the world $188.00 countries all over the world we're not going to forget it we're not going to forget it but we're doing great coming back we're coming back in our numbers are better than almost all countries I will tell us the spite what you hear look at all of them up there thanks got to look at all of that fake news and some believe that. Unfortunately Fox has become vagueness to I don't know what happens to these people right you agree. At least the other side you know where they're coming from but I'll use every tool of my disposal to arrest those violators of federal law and put them behind bars and that's where the our work you know when they were ripping down the statues are great statues they were ripping him down I passed and signed something that's beautiful it says 10 years in prison if you're knocked out is that you know what how far what I have been Scott I don't see it anymore now they go up they look at a statue and they say. 10 years and a long time they say let's get out of here but did you notice that 3 months ago I signed it they were going to have thousands of people March on Washington to rip down statues and these people are sick they're anarchists they were going to knock down Thomas Jefferson George Washington Abraham Lincoln he was fair game Abraham Lincoln so I said these people are sick they are troubled individuals they're an ark is an agitator is there not just protest as they call him peaceful protest is your peaceful protest is on the record you're peaceful broke the law and by the way you're a lot like the sky over here look at the size of that guy you're a lot tougher than they are just so you understand that oh right. There are signs that act Thank you. But Biden and her wrists are pro crime and then take up that there is no other way to say and we're Ed Tykerb we are pro cop all the way I've gotten the endorsement of God The Were I got the endorsement Pat Lynch New York City police they gave us the doors for the 1st time I think he said I think it's the 1st time they've ever done it that means it's been a long time they don't do that kind of thing they endorsed me all the sheriffs in Florida endorsed me what you have all of the law enforcement in Texas said Dorsey we're getting indorsement from we haven't found anybody that a law enforcement we haven't found anybody and if we do I think they'd probably be in big trouble I really do I think they'd be in big trouble because nobody could figure it out we are getting the endorsement of law and these are great people these are great Americans these are people that want our people to be safe . We're thrilled today to be joined by county sheriffs or across the state and I'm deeply honored to receive the endorsement of more than 3 dozen Wisconsin sheriffs Where are you saw a god was the oath and you that thank good looking people with i.q. and I thank you and I like that Maersk Maggette America I wonder if he supports trapeze got married get this big whether he's a trumpet a thank you Sheriff we appreciate a good looking guys good looking guy with an I'll never let you down here so I'll never let you down you know that you know we gave you all of the surplus equipment we had millions and millions of dollars of surplus equipment and. Obama and Biden didn't want to give it they didn't want to give it they thought it looked too militaristic meaning it was a lot of it was really defensive equipment so that we can keep our law enforcement safe and I distributed it all of the hundreds of millions of dollars it was sitting there drawing dust in warehouses that we would probably pay a fortune for all over the country and you got it we all got it everybody got it and everybody's happy God bless as president and as your president I will always stand with law enforcement and that's something that I can't even imagine anybody saying anything differently but this other side does they say it differently I mean nobody can even understand that this November the voters of Wisconsin will not surrender their beloved state to the left wing mob and that's what would happen by a law and in $78.00 days we're going to stop the radical left we're going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win 4 more years was. Was Oh god god god or God or God or God And then there are so that will go for another 4 years because you know what they spite of my campaign we should get a redo of the law we caught him spying on the can you believe it did you see the f.b.i. agent he agreed eaves pleading that he forged documents so that's that's good no no way you see it's going to be incredible but they spidered my campaign they spied on our campaign nobody has ever seen anything like it you can call it whatever you want I use the word treason they got.

Enders does a great job thank you I think we are looking great here you know we wanted last time and you remember what a big shock wave because a Republican had wanted for a long time and they were waiting for Pennsylvania and we won Pennsylvania it we had lost every vote would've won but they didn't want to call it it got later and later or later than Wisconsin came in and then Michigan came in and then Pennsylvania came in by that time we already had North Carolina. You know it's hard for Republicans you have to run. The whole board because they start off that we're going to play for New York with all of the crime in New York I'm going to play for New York because we did well in New York. Thank you did well in New York but we're going to play for New York and we're going to play I don't know yes we'll do a little bit of a tiny shot maybe in California they like b.. And we'll do a tiny little shot in Illinois the other one we're going to do we're going to go after New Jersey we're going to go after Virginia we have a crazy governor of Virginia he doesn't want you to have guns and he doesn't mind not only abortion he doesn't mind execution because after birth we'll decide what to do with the baby right now no f. did you hear this guy 1st time I heard of it Scott after birth we will decide and we will discuss with the mother and that's the 1st time I've heard of it this is the guy that likes to pretend these Michael Jackson right with the dead say his wife saved him great embarrassment we have another great friend of mine a great great politician but really he's much more than a politician he's an exceptional human being he is tough I had to go against him in those presidential primaries and I want to tell you this nobody tougher but he basically loves this state mean he loves this state and he should be your governor right now was should. Was cut the thank you he's an exceptional man Scott Walker Governor Scott Rod was Thal tell you one thing he's one of the most respected men he goes into Washington everybody stands up and they really do respect him a lot and it's really something the next time you run please don't put marijuana on the ballot at the same time you're running you brought out like a 1000000 people that nobody ever knew coming out. Because there was no way but you can do whatever you want you know that you going to be successful what whatever you want to do thank you very much God forbid was so before the virus came in from China thank you unemployment in Wisconsin had reached the lowest rate ever recorded ever recorded. Now as part of Scott's they do I have to give him a little credit there right I have to do that but we created $15000.00 Wisconsin manufacturing jobs everybody said that would be impossible 121000 Wisconsinites were lifted out of poverty and 100000 were lifted off of food stamps because they had good job Thad we had created the single greatest economy in the history of the world our national economy was better than any economy that had ever happened before it and China was having the worst year they had in 67 years not that I want that but we took in billions of dollars we had nobody ever charged China for doing anything what the money they took out of our country for so many years and the presidents that preceded me should be ashamed of themselves for allowing it to happen and that includes sleepy Joe was part of that thank God But then we were hit by the virus and I had to close it up by took the greatest economy and I'd close that up and we saved millions of lives as many lives should have been won but what you see today you could multiply it times 10 or 15 or maybe even 20 it would have been a horrible it would not have been sustainable and now where bringing it back it will bring it back so strongly. Thank you I took unprecedented action to save the us economy and support Wisconsin families under our paycheck protection program we helped save 0. For $1000000.00 Wisconsin jobs earlier this month I issued a directive granting emergency payroll tax relief to every worker making under $100000.00 per year Thad this temporary relief will help tens of millions of American workers that is something that people really out today the great economists that's what they want the payroll tax cut more than any other thing and it really applies number when they open their business is great for them but really great for you and it's a big savings it's a lot of money in your pocket if Republicans win in November we will forgive these payments in full thank God the word Thanks to my administration's policies we're now witnessing the fastest you cut and you've seen this right the fastest economic recovery in the history of our country over the past 3 months we have already gained much more than 9000000 jobs nationwide that's a record that's not even close by the way. And you know you heard about the v. the v the famous 3 and there's a well maybe not a me it's got to be a damn it's got to be it has it's got to be they have no doubt it's turned out to be a super of the because the numbers are much better when you see the numbers coming retail spending has fully recovered and is now at an all time high and auto production has surged 28 percent of the worth and it leaving the great plane right behind me and we have a lot of televisions we have televisions and closets I was saying to another group we have televisions on floors and ceilings we have tele you can't escape but if you want to get away from Trump you can't be on that plane because. The fake news and drop you know they're going to go out of business when I do leave it let's say 60. 20 years something like when we live. When we leave they're all out of business. I wouldn't say that sleepy Joe would be very excited to come right don't think a lot of let's turn on the Biden say today darling. But you know I just noticed on television that Nat stag that's a big deal now as dad hit an all time record today the highest was the highest price ever thank the others are right behind it I mean who would think we have a pandemic I think we're way on the other side of the pandemic we're doing great with vaccines and therapeutics and everything else but regardless we're doing great with it but who would think that we had a record with that stack and the others are right there if you would have said we're at $28000.00 on the Dow We're just about and if you would have said Nasdaq hit a new record high that's great for your for a one k's look you get the wrong person and here you go for a one K.'s wave goodbye to a They'll be worthless they'll be worth right for a one k's that's one of the things a lot of people are bragging you know about 4 months ago they were very depressed I said don't sell don't sell Don't worry about the sell forget about this and most people held and they're very very good but husbands come up to me and wives come up to me and one wife was saying sir I always thought my husband was a financial loser a total loser he was his big good looking policeman actually. And she said you know you've never been good with money but over the years over the last few years I think it was up 89 percent I said that's not as good as most people he said No no my husband is a financial genius and there's good looking policemen said Thank you sir because I was abused for a long time about the way I invested but. Thank. You for a one K.'s a grade and your stocks a great. You know when you see these big companies going up that's everybody that's everybody the stock market that's everybody that's just an indication and they're smart people they know where it's going you know they have it it's think that's better than most people and they see what's happening now with all of that we have a headwind and the headwind is a for any reason we didn't win that stock market is going to go down like a rock goes through water I hate to tell you folks so good look at it we didn't have if we didn't have that headwind your stocks would be even higher right now even higher so on election night expect your 401 K.'s and your stocks to go very very high and I do believe we're going to have a tremendous and. I do believe Thanks again the most enthusiasm that anybody has ever seen in any election is this one the most enthusiasm so we've got to get out and vote got to be careful with your balance be careful be careful here absentee ballots great you're others you've got to be very careful or go to vote just go to vote you know. Go to her. We have a little problem here you have a Democrat governor who is will do anything that they think could turn things around. How is Tom Tiffani doing by the way another when we just had a nice win right is Tom Tom is around here someplace Tom Tiffany just got a great win well winning a lot we've won a lot of House seats we're going to definitely we're going to take back the house the door and say thank you our thanks as part of our great rebuilding the u.s. military we also signed a 5500000000 dollar contract to build combat ships in Marin that Wisconsin supporting thousands of jobs for us thank God thank God. Ah thank. Her or her. Dad or. We've totally rebuilt our military we've spent $2.00 trillion dollars all made in the USA all made in the us. We have new fighter jets we have new rockets we've upgraded our nuclear I hope to God we never have to use it but nobody's even close it was getting very tired getting very tired what we've done with our military is incredible with tanks speaking of tanks we left our great tank I was supposed to close down we have a tank factory in the Lima Lima Ohio and it was scheduled to close and I went to see it I said No way would closing it because there's no way we could ever reproduce. That incredible and and you know it happened we didn't close it and we are building tanks like you wouldn't believe but what we've done with our military has been incredible and Biden has promised to slash our defense budget destroying critical jobs but more importantly if we don't have defense everything we talk about is meaningless we have to have the feds defense of our country especially when you look at what's happening outside of our borders so we have the greatest right now when I took it over was totally depleted it was God right now we have the greatest military we've ever had the greatest equipment by far we've ever had. The data was Thank You have come out and Biden are ever elected this recovery will come to a total shut down to use that word permanently for no scientific reason Biden wants to inflict dramatic harm on millions of Americans with his basement strategy locking everyone in their homes you. Look at what's happening with some of you got a dose of it right here I hate to say with some of these Democrat governors they just don't want to open it up by the way on November 4th they'll announce what we have decided to open November for. Got to get out to those polls I'm serious this is the most dangerous election we've ever had the most dangerous because I don't think we can ever bring it back if they get in I don't think there's anything called a comeback it will be another event as well I used to say that lightly I now say it very strongly because it's a similar ideology this will be a large scale very large scale Venezuela if they win. We're going to weigh my administration by contrast is following the science applying common sense mitigation sheltering bird you know this we've got a shelter we've got to take care but what do we really have to do we have to take care of our elderly people our elderly people with heart problems with diabetes and we'll launch an operation warp speed to deliver effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine therapeutics more than 270 therapies are in clinical trials can you believe it 270 and you're going to be here is a very good news very very soon now you know we're dealing with a deep say right so I'm watching it very closely I don't need to have them announce on November 4th ladies and gentlemen we've found a vaccine that's perfect I don't need that I don't need that and hopefully everyone's looking to do the right thing we want to get it out quickly but we're very close both on therapy and on therapeutics add on vaccines. Advances in treatment. Have reduced the fate Tallinn the rate in adults by 85 percent since April think of that they get heard. 3 vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials and we're mass producing doses already of that vaccine because we think it works and we're going to have it out very quickly we will defeat the China virus we will have the greatest economy that we've ever had next year unless somebody wants to quadruple your taxes and the crazy things that they're talking about we will have next year the single greatest economy we've ever had laws are also Biden has been there for 47 year and he's personally supported every blow bill a sellout of the last half century he voted for NAFTA one of the worst trade deals in history for the China entry into the World Trade Organization a total catastrophe for Korea the Korean deal was horrible we renegotiated it now it's a really great deal for us one in 4 u.s. manufacturing jobs disappeared almost overnight Biden was strongly in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have destroyed our automobile manufacturing business it would have been a disaster for our country I ended it but I approved the Dakota access pipeline immediately the Keystone pipeline 48000 thank you one of the great rip offs that was done in my opinion to hurt our country because we have so much energy we're now energy independent was I got out of this horrible power a slime an accord which was a ripoff for NACA Law Thank God it would have shipped millions of American jobs to China while allowing China to pollute with impunity and they don't even enter the agreement until 2030 so we it would have been a disaster so many things are stacked against us even in the World Trade Organization China. Is considered a developing nation therefore they get tremendous guess what we don't except that we've had 4 of them we don't accept it and we're not it and we're not approving any of those judges until such time as that ends. Are thanks so time and again thanks sleepy Joe Biden put China 1st in American last even to a point where a son who had absolutely wears hunta Has anyone seen one he's had absolutely no experience walked away with one and a half $1000000000.00 to manage as millions of dollars a year and if you go to the pros of Wall Street they'll tell you it's an impossibility it was a 10 minute meeting he walked away with one and a half 1000000000 from China how do you think he's going to do negotiating by against China Ok nobody's done what I've done the Jaina to Russia a by the way remember we're going to be a war in a war with North Korea what happened to the war we're going to go along Kim Jong un we get along let's see what happens and meantime it's almost 4 years right remember we were going to be in a war Thank you look at a look at all those people back that's a lot of people Thad's a lot of wealth and look at all the fake dues is that incredible round. There a lot of it's a lot of fake news back there's got. At the end of Joe Biden's 8 years as vice president nearly 2000000 Americans a prime worky day job dropped out of the workforce our factories were stolen our country was doing wow z. he lost nearly 200000 manufacturing jobs he was by the way a disaster on swine flu he got a horrible rating in Gallup look at the Gallup Poll look at the Gallup poll so they call it. H one n one right here remember h one swine flu h one n one he calls it and one h one but I don't hold them in that. And that's one of the the bigger mistakes is when he says these are the different say when you speak in great to be in a great state of Ohio but don't know no we're not in Ohio. You know what you do it's you know it's you know it you do when that happens you just walk off because there's nothing you can do it or a guy happened to him like $16.00 times almost every time that's why he doesn't talk. He shot he shot we got to say look one thing I've learned. Putin's president she of China right Kim Jong Il heir to one of Turkey they are world class chess players we can have a guy who shot and it is best years wasn't very good he was a very good week and how are these guys a world class Test player thank God they're all dreaming thank their all dreaming of Joe Biden out is dreaming about it is Iran if we win and when we when we are going to have a deal with the Rana mediately they're just waiting hoping that Biden gets in hoping John Kerry is saying oh you should he by the way if anybody violated the Logan Act It was John Kerry right John Kerry not General Flynn and John Kerry. Of course of health insurance for American families had skyrocketed under Obama and Biden by $4800.00 and nearly $11000000.00 more Americans were influenced him so Biden's abysmal record but you do have to check the swine flu because that was peanuts compared to this monster this monster is the worst thing that's happened in this world since 1917 right where it could have been a 100000000 people died swine flu though look at his ratings in Gallup check them out they gave them really bad ratings Joe Biden not that that matters but that does matter right you know when a guy is critical and we've done an incredible job including among the best numbers in the world Joe Biden's abysmal record of failure betrayal ended the day I took the oath of office we got up people back working we made real deals with foreign countries Oh thank you I told Japan I told Japan Thank you Prime Minister Abi great guy but I said Prime Minister you have to build places in Michigan. You have to build your places in other countries and other other areas of our country it's not fair we have a big deficit go to Wisconsin go to Ohio go to these places he said he's going to do it many many Japanese plants now are being built all over a country somebody had asked him to do it somebody had to tell them to do it it's not fair and it was all happening then it came and now it's going out watch what's going to happen watch how good the 3rd quarter is the 3rd quarter is coming up right before the election watch how good Scott Walker what even you will be impressed by those numbers. Even sky Oh Ok but we passed massive tax cuts we passed massive regulation cuts and you know want to you might not feel this may be the most important thing I did for making the economy great wasn't just the tax cuts it was the regulation cuts because the regulation cuts allowed companies to go out and build projects that they couldn't get approved for 15 years and 20 years right or a big deal thanks we'll replace probably the worst trade deal ever NAFTA with the brand new US MCA which puts us right at the top and now Canada and Mexico are doing what's right for our country. Yes but a great deal thank you and when they were his constant temperature and does 3 was being threatened by administration took immediate action we impose tariffs on dumped foreign goods and subsidized products saving countless timber jobs all across your state and you know exactly what I'm talking about you were taken advantage of by stupid US policy Canada was taking. Digit of this country not anymore thank God thank you if Biden and the crew get in the Radical Left will bring timber production to a total halt I stood up to China's decades of trading abuses and when China targeted our farmers we provided $28000000000.00 in relief we gave our farmers I said to Secretary producer of Agriculture Sunny how much they've targeted our farmers How much have they been targeted for server 2 years ago is 12000000000 last year was $1628000000000.00 Dodo I said guess what we're charging tariffs of $28000000000.00 to John and. We charge so much more and we gave 12000000000 in 1628 we gave 28 the farmers in here and the farmers did I do a good job for you please. I don't hear any farmers complain back and I have every right we did a good job with a more typical president I want to be nice more typical every farmer would be out of business right now but we gave 28000000000 to the farmers think of that and the farmers are doing well and then we signed a deal with China and I was very excited because I had a very good relationship with President Xi we signed a great deal and the Under the deal they would buy $240000000000.50 of farm product and then manufacturing once the China flew came in once a china stuff came in I was not really I was and I couldn't it was different but I have to tell you. 4 days ago the court order right was the largest corner order in the history. Of ordering. It was the biggest China ordered 2 days the biggest order in the history of corn then they did if you look at soybeans it was the largest soybean order in history in history and also beef cattle etc So it just shows you how smart China is we signed a deal and the plague comes in it might have been a mistake it might have been on purpose who knows what happened we'll figure it out but whatever it was it was no good they could have stopped it but they know my attitude I don't like it I don't like it so a normal country that's not so smart in that position Scott what is said oh we don't like the way he's talking about us let's immediately shut down he didn't do that they said let's order more from the farmers that we've ordered biggest corn biggest soybean biggest cattle and now I'm getting my farmers and server. We saw in the like China I said you know what we've got to be very careful you understand that so what they've done is they've gone out they've made massive orders so I think how smart that is 99 percent of people in that position would say well we're not going to order any more they say let's order so much that they become almost reliant on us very smart very very smart America's spent nearly 4 years planing up the mess we inherited from Joe Biden's 47 year worth of disaster you know it's incredible he's in there for 47 years he does nothing now all of a sudden he's going to do all these things he's going to get tough on China sure China will own the United States if we don't make this deal and we were going up if we don't get elected China will own that mark my word well I hope you're not going to be able to test it out Ok China well China will own the United States Iran will insist on an even better deal than they made with Obama they got 150000000000 dollars 1800000000 in cash green cash for nothing we got nothing out of that deal and I terminated that deal I terminated and we moved the capital of Israel to Jerusalem. That's been the evangelical Thank you know it's amazing with. The evangelicals some are excited about that then Jewish people it's early right it's incredible but we did we did that and Golan Heights don't forget Golan Heights we did go a lot of time so we've done a lot in February Biden said if you elect me your taxes are going to be raised they're not going to be cut that's a quote How the hell do you do this. That well it's. Only in the state can we get away with. But you have to be right Ok you happened to be right. So I just want to say this this has been an incredible experience for me getting to know you I've been here a lot we won this state we weren't expected to win the state or the author was the Word of God Ah we've been great for each other we've been great for each other it's really you know it's a partnership in a sense but we've been great for each other we brought a lot of business to the state we're bringing a lot more business to the state whether it's the ships or to the crops or any one of the so many different things especially maybe the trade deal with Canada and Mexico because because of Wisconsin and us specialize milk a small subject but the right farmers got me at the right time of this sort Wow you guys are really being taken advantage of with Canada charging you 287 percent tariff I bet I think you mostly know about that but unless you're up here a lot like I was you'd never find that out and I work with Scott and I work with others or we solved all of these problems we solved all of them Scott right. This is the most important election we ever had we've got to stop these radical left maniacs we've got to win this election law with. God. God or God or God or. We have many things to do we want to finish it up it's no different you plant a tree it takes a little time to grab on in addition we have other things we're going to do more regulation cutting even more tax cutting we're going to be doing very substantial. Tax cuts because that's an incentive toward growth and we're going to do it and we proved to be right we proved to be 100 percent right we're not letting them raise your taxes on you and destroy everything that we've done so I just want to thank the incredible people of Wisconsin God lawyer was who really are your only or your estate that despite everything everything that they were saying Well Wisconsin can't be won was going to guess what and I think we're much way far ahead I do believe we're way far ahead where we were if you look back 4 years I think we have much more spirit you see this is easier in a sense now the virus made it a little bit more difficult maybe a lot more difficult because all of a sudden something happened that nobody ever even thought about but we handled it we handled it and we handled it well and we're now helping other countries with the ventilators and other things but the easier part is I used to come up as a businessman I was very successful and I'd say we're going to do this we're going to do tax cuts we're going to even Space Force I never even talked about space but we did more. Somebody said we actually did more than we promise that's never happened with a politician before right we did actually more but I never talked about Space Force and then I got to doff as I said we need that because you look at what China is doing what Russia is doing what others are looking at so we have space for us 1st time in 78 years since the Air Force that that's happened full scale so it's great but and you're a big beneficiary of that as you know. So we have to win the election we can't play games get out and vote do those beautiful absentee ballots or just make sure your vote gets counted make sure because the only way we're going to lose a select. Is if the election is rigged to remember that the only way we're going to lose this election so we have to be very careful look we have this is more than this election that's a big statement the only way they're going to win is that way and we can't let that happen and you know our postoffice we're going to make our Post Office great it's been a disaster for many years we're going to take care of the men and women in the post office and we're going to make it great right now it's a laughing stock Amazon and these companies come in they dop they drop all of their packages into the post office and the post office loses. Trillion me just hundreds of billions of dollars delivering these packages let them deliver to let them pay the right prize you know so that said But we're going to make our post office strong we're going to make our postoffice really strong and really great we're going to be proud of it again it lost $78000000000.00 in a short period of time over the last 12 or 13 years 78000000000 dollars We want to make our postoffice strong we want to be proud of it I want to thank you very much you've been my friends my true friends we will win and we will make America great again",

         "So we're going to North Carolina. We have a packed place, and it's going to be, I think, very exciting, as it was last night in Minnesota. That was an incredible event. We have some very big news on TikTok. TikTok is moving along. We're dealing with Oracle, which you know of. Larry Ellison. And we're dealing with, as a combination, Walmart , Walmart, a great company. A great American company. The security will be 100 percent. They'll be using separate clouds and a lot of very, very powerful security. And they'll be making about a 5-billion-dollar contribution toward education. We're going to be setting up a very large fund toward the education of American youth. And that'll be great. That's their contribution that I've been asking for. But we'll see whether or not it all happens. But, conceptually, I think it's a great deal for America. They'll be hiring at least 25,000 people. It'll most likely be incorporated in Texas. It'll be a brand-new company. It will have nothing to do with any outside land, any outside country. It will have nothing to do with China. It'll be totally secure. That'll be part of the deal, and that will be both Oracle, as you know, and Walmart. And I think it's going to be a fantastic deal. The technology is superior to anything in the world, and we like that. And, again, a lot of jobs, a lot of money. A lot of money for our country. Billions of dollars of taxes will be paid every year. And hundreds of millions of users, and they'll be happy. So everybody will be happy. It's a severance. It'll continue to be named TikTok, as it was all along. And that's it. That's it. So I can say that I have given the deal my blessing. If they get it done, that's great. If they don't, that's okay too. But it's a great deal for America, and very interesting.",

         "Thank you all for. Thank you for that very warm welcome it is an honor to be here today with the men and women of the Alliance Defending Freedom and you are champions for our 1st freedom and it is my great honor to be with all of you today. But before we get started allow me to see a few words about the horrific mass shootings that occurred over this weekend in . El Paso and day. Like all Americans Karen and I were outraged and sickened by these barbaric attacks. As I stand before you today 31 people have died. 53 were injured. And it breaks our hearts. To see so many innocent lives cut short by unspeakable violence. What happened this weekend were acts of pure evil. And we express our deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. And we join every American praying for the injured and their families. In their hour of need. The Bible says The Lord is close to the broken hearted. And that will be our prayer for the people of Dayton and El Paso. We also commend the men and women of law enforcement in both states. Whose quick action. And courageous service undoubtedly saved lives they earned the admiration and gratitude to thousands and as President Trump said his address to the nation yesterday, hate has no place in America. And the sinister ideologies of racism bigotry and white supremacy must be defeated in the wake of previous violence hard ministration worked on a bipartisan basis with the Congress to strengthen background checks and improve school safety. In the wake of this weekend's mass shootings the president has brought the full resources of the federal government to assist law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for these heinous acts. Justice will be swift and certain. The president has also directed the f.b.i. to use all legal means available to disrupt hate crimes and to prevent domestic terrorism before it occurs. We directed the Department of Justice to work with local state federal agencies as well as social media companies to develop new tools to identify those seeking to do harm before they strike. And the president called for all of us to work together to end the glorification of violence in our society and to reform our mental health laws will work to identify entry and where necessary and voluntarily confine all those deemed a risk to themselves or the public safety. And that as we speak guard ministration is working with members of Congress to ensure that all those who pose a risk to public safety are denied access to firearms. And finally because justice delayed is justice denied we're developing legislation to ensure that those who commit mass murders face the death penalty swiftly. In years not decades. And tomorrow the president and the 1st lady will travel to Dayton and El Paso to express the sympathies and support of the American people for all those impacted by these hideous attacks and as a president also said. Now is the time to set destructive partisanship aside and find the courage to answer hatred with Unity devotion and love now is the time to overcome evil with good you know it's always been true throughout the long history of this country that in times of trial the American people turn to faith and prayer. Bible tells us that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray. That he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal our land. And in this dark hour for the people of El Paso. We do well to pray. Pray for healing. Pray for the families of those that were lost and engine pray for these communities and for our nation as a whole. We also do well in this time to recognize that the greatest source of community in the modern world is faith our nation was built on strong voluntary associations and depends on them more today than ever before from the American founding voluntary associations churches synagogues places of worship and religious education have been at the center of American communities and they are the wellspring of American strength. but as you all in ADF know well. We live in a time where. We've seen people driving religion from the public square and it's even become fashionable for many in the media and popular culture to mock religious beliefs. The freedom of religion was enshrined in the Bill of Rights as our 1st freedom because it was at the center of the American founding. And also because it's the wellspring of order in a free society. Our 1st vice president John Adams. Said and I quote Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other. That's why from early on in this administration President Trump has stood for the freedom of religion and stood with people of faith. tonne as you know well we've taken action to protect the freedom of speech in places of worship we've restored federal enforcement of our nation's conscience laws and taken action to protect the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and health care providers. We've also gone to court to protect the right to religious expression in the public square and the Alliance Defending Freedom has been there every step of the way",

AND, BY THE WAY, THE BIRTHPLACE OF A GENTLEMAN, NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE HEARD OF HIM, ELVIS PRESLEY. BUT TO BE WITH THOUSANDS OF INCREDIBLE PATRIOTS WHO PUT THEIR FAITH IN GOD, FAMILY AND COUNTRY. RIGHT? FOUR DAYS FROM NOW THIS STATE WILL HEAD TO THE POLLS AND VOTE TO CONTINUE OUR EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS WITH YOUR NEXT GOVERNOR, REPUBLICAN TATE REEVES. GREAT GUY. UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP JOBS ARE BOOMING, CONFIDENCE IS SOARING, WAGES ARE RISING, CRIME IS FALLING, AND OUR NATION IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. WE'RE NOW AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE. WE'VE NEVER BEEN IN A POSITION LIKE IT. WE'VE REBUILT OUR MILITARY, AND WE HAVE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND, BY THE WAY, FOR THOSE OF YOU WITH A THING CALLED 401s THE STOCK MARKET HIT TODAY ANOTHER ALL-TIME HISTORIC HIGH. UNEMPLOYMENT IN MISSISSIPPI HAS REACHED THE LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED. EVER RECORDED. THAT'S NOT BAD. THAT'S NOT BAD WHEN YOU'RE ON THE DEBATE STAGE AND YOU SAY WE HAVE THE BEST ECONOMY WE'VE EVER HAD, WE HAVE THE BEST MILITARY WE'VE EVER HAD, THE BEST UNEMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS WE'VE EVER HAD. MS. . THE BEST PRESIDENT WE'VE EVER HAD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE'VE CONFIRMED MORE THAN 158 BRAND NEW, BEAUTIFUL FEDERAL JUDGES TO UPHOLD OUR CONSTITUTION. IN A VERY SHORT WHILE, WE'LL HAVE 182 FEDERAL JUDGES. PRESIDENT OBAMA LEFT US 142. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PRESIDENT OBAMA. HE LEFT US 142 OPENINGS. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO LEAVE UP IN WHEN YOU LEAVE OFFICE NONE WHEN YOU LEAVE OFFICE, BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL. AND JUST DAYS AGO THE UNITED STATES BROUGHT THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TERRORIST LEADER TO JUSTICE. WE HAVE GREAT MILITARY, AND IT WAS VERY, VERY DEPLETED. WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE, IT WAS VERY, VERY DEPLETED, BUT IT AIN'T9 DEPLETED ANYMORE IT AIN'T DEPLETED ANYMORE. YEAH, al-BAGHDADI, THE FOUNDER AND LEADER LOOK, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT HIM FOR A LONG TIME. I KEPT SAYING, WHERE IS AL-BAGHDADI? THAT'S THE ONE I WANT. WHERE IS HE? AND THEN, BY THE WAY, FOLLOWING DAY WE GOT NUMBER TWO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT. BUT HE WAS THE FOUNDER AND THE LEADER OF ISIS, AND HE'S DEAD. AND BAGHDADI, HE WAS A SAVAGE AND SOULLESS MONSTER. BUT HIS REIGN OF TERROR IS OVER. AMERICAN SPECIAL OPERATORS EXECUTED A MASTERFUL RAID THAT ENDED HIS WRETCHED LIFE AND PUNCHED OUT HIS TICKET TO HELL, I GUESS YOU COULD SAY. HE SPENT HIS LAST MISERABLE MOMENTS ON EARTH COWERING AND TREMBLING AND CRYING IN FEAR OF THE AMERICAN WARRIOR THAT WAS RIGHT THERE GOING RIGHT UP. NO ENEMY STANDS A CHANCE AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUS MIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. AND MISSISSIPPI LOVES OUR MILITARY, THAT I CAN TELL YOU, AND OUR MILITARY LOVES MISSISSIPPI. AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN, AND AMERICA IS ALL OVER THE WORLD RESPECTED AGAIN. IT'S ABOUT TIME. BUT WHILE WE'RE CREATING JOBS AND KILLING TERRORISTS, THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS GONE COMPLETELY INSANE. THE RADICAL LEFT IS DETERMINED TO TRANSFORM AMERICA INTO A COUNTRY YOU WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE. WE ARE THE ONES STANDING IN THEIR WAY, AND WE WILL NEVER GET OUT OF THEIR WAY. IT WILL BE EASY. FROM EVEN BEFORE WE WON THE ELECTION, THE FAR-LEFT DEMOCRATS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA RIGHT BACK THERE, LOOK AT ALL OF THEM, OH. IT'S TOO BAD WE GET SUCH GOOD RATINGS, BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T, THEY WOULDN'T BE HERE. LOOK AT HOW MANY IT'S LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS BEFORE IT FAILED, RIGHT? AND YOU KNOW WHY IT FAILED? BECAUSE THEY DISRESPECTED US. WITH BUT BUT THE MEDIA AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A CORRUPT PARTNERSHIP TRYING TO IMPOSE THEIR WILL AND TO THWART AMERICAN DEMOCRACY BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. FIRST, THEY ENGINEERED THE RUSSIA HOAX. THAT WAS A TOTAL HOAX. THE SINGLE GREATEST LIES EVER FOISTERRED UPON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEN THE MUELLER WITCH HUNT. IT NEVER ENDED. WITH 18 ANGRY DEMOCRATS AND AN UNLIMITED BUDGET, LET'S GO GET HIM, THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL, DID IT? THAT FIZZLED. A LOT OF BAD PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY. AND NOW CORRUPT POLITICIANS NANCY PELOSI AND SHIFTY ADAM SCHIFF, SHIFTY AND THE MEDIA ARE CONTINUING WITH THE DERANGED IMPEACHMENT WITCH HUNT. THIS IS ONE I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE INVOLVED IN. THE WORD IMPEACHMENT, TO ME IT'S A DIRTY WORD, NOT A GOOD WORD. TOTALLY PHONY DEAL. THEY KNOW IT, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE NEVER HAD GREATER SUPPORT THAN WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. AND IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO OUTSIDE. YOU'LL SEE A LOT MORE PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN. SO IF ANYBODY WANTS TO GIVE UP YOUR SEAT, PLEASE, JUST WALK OUT ANYBODY WANT TO LEAVE? BECAUSE THERE REALLY IS, THERE'S NO PLACE BETTER TO HAVE A RALLY, TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND TO ALSO AT THE SAME TIME BE VERY SERIOUS THAN TO HAVE A TRUMP RALLY ESPECIALLY ON FRIDAY NIGHT IN MISSISSIPPI. WE COULD HAVE DONE THIS ONE ON MONDAY NIGHT, I SAID LET'S DO FRIDAY, RIGHT? YESTERDAY THE DEMOCRATS VOTED TO POTENTIALLY NULLIFY THE VOTES OF 63 MILLION AMERICANS, DISGRACING THEMSELVES AND BRINGING SHAME UPON THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THEY'VE BEEN NOTING TO OVERTHROW THE ELECTION SINCE THE MOMENT I WON, BUT THE PEOPLE HERE THAT ARE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED KNOW LONG BEFORE I WON. 19 MINUTES AFTER AFTER I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE, THE HORRIBLE NEWSPAPER FAKE, FAKE, FAKE WASHINGTON POST DECLARED THE CAMPAIGN TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT BUSH PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS JUST BEGUN. AT LEAST THEY GAVE US 19 MINUTES. YESTERDAY'S VOTE BY THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS IS AN ATTACK ON DEMOCRACY ITSELF. BUT I'LL TELL YOU THE REPUBLICANS ARE REALLY STRONG, THE STRONGEST I'VE EVER SEEN THEM, THE MOST UNIFIED AYE EVER SEEN THEM. I'VE EVER SEEN THEM. THE MOST UNIFIED I'VE EVER SEEN THEM. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH DEMOCRAT LIES, HOAXES AND EXTREMISM. THE DEMOCRATS' OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT HAS CREATED AN ANGRY MAJORITY THAT WILL VOTE MANY DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS OUT OF OFFICE IN 2020. ING MAKE MAKE NO MISTAKE, THEY ARE COMING AFTER THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ME BECAUSE I'M FIGHTING FOR YOU. THEY DON'T LIKE IT. THIS IS DIFFERENT, THEY'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS. WELL, THEY'VE NEVER HAD AN ELECTION LIKE 2016 EITHER, HAVE THEY? IT'S NEVER HAPPENED. THEY'VE NEVER QUITE FIGURED IT OUT. AND THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T WIN. SO LET'S TRY AND IMPEACH HIM, HOW ABOUT THAT CRAZY REPRESENTATIVE AL GREEN, RIGHT? YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO IMPEACH HIM BECAUSE WE CAN'T BEAT HIM. I DON'T THINK SO, RIGHT? I DON'T THINK SO. AL GREEN, HE'S ANOTHER BEAUTY. THE DEMOCRATS, THE MEDIA EXPECT DEEP STATE ARE DESPERATE TO STOP US, AND IT'S NOT ME, IT'S US, IT'S ALL OF US. IT'S 63 MILLION, BUT IT'S MUCH MORE THAN 63 MILLION, MUCH MORE. AND RIGHT NOW OUR NUMBERS ARE HIGHER THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE, SO, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE NEVER BEEN, THEY'VE NEVER BEEN BUT THEY WANT TO STOP US BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE ARE HERE, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING, AND THAT'S WHAT'S TAKING UP SO MUCH TIME. WE'RE DRAPING THE SWAMP IN WASHINGTON DRAINING THE SWAMP IN WASHINGTON. NOTHING TERRIFIES DEMOCRATS MORE THAN THE FACT THAT ALL OF THEIR SPYING SPYING. THEY ACTUALLY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? I MEAN, THEY TRIED, OH, WE WERE ACTUALLY JUST CHECKING THINGS OUT. THE LYING, THE FALSIFYING. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS PLUS, BEFORE I EVER EVEN ANNOUNCED THEY WERE SPYING. I GUESS THEY KNEW WE WERE GOING TO WIN, RIGHT? BUT OVER THE PAST MORE THAN THREE YEARS IS FINALLY BEING EXPOSED. AND REMEMBER THIS, THE TRUTH IS A FORCE OF NATURE. DESPERATE TO CONCEAL THEIR DECEIT, THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOW ATTACKING US FOR CALLING OUT THE GRAVE CORRUPTION OF THE BIDENS JUST LIKE THEY MELTED DOWN WHEN WE POINTED OUT CROOKED HILLARY'S SHOCKING AND VERY MANY MYSTIQUES. MISDEEDS. 33,000 E-MAILS, 33,000 E-MAILS DISAPPEARED. BUT SHE SAID THEY ONLY HAD TO DO WITH HER WORKING OUT AND HER DAUGHTER'S WEDDING. WE LOVE THE ENVIRONMENT, EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE CLEANEST AIR AND THE CLEANEST WATER THAT WE'VE EVER HAD AND YET WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD AND ENERGY BY FAR. I DON'T KNOW, JILL STEIN, SHE RAN LAST TIME, I KNOW SHE'S NOT AN AGENT OF RUSSIA. WHEN HILLARY MADE THOSE STATEMENTS, THEY WORK FOR RUSSIA, THEIR AGENTS bbI SAID, WHEN SHE MADE THATSTATEMENT ABOUT ME THREE YEARS AGO IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS TO GET OUT OF THAT STATEMENT. SHE MADE IT ABOUT THEM, EVERYBODY LAUGHED. BECAUSE OF WHAT WE PROVE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THESE ARE VERY BAD PEOPLE THESE ARE VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE AND THE MEDIA IS WORSE THAN ALL OF THEM. THINK ABOUT THE PREPOSTEROUS HOPES THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOW TRYING TO PEDDLE. LOOK. WOULD IT HAVE NOT TOO MUCH POLITICAL EXPENSE OF THE BUILT LOTS OF BUILDINGS ALL OVER THE PLACE HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN SHOW BUSINESS, JUST DID ONE SHOW CALLED THE APPRENTICE. 14 SEASONS AND WHILE I LEFT CRAZY ARNOLD TOOK OVER. IT DIDN'T DO TOO WELL. IT WAS DEAD. IT WAS DEAD FROM THE FIRST EPISODE I SAW IT I SAID IT'S TERRIBLE WHAT ARE THEY DONE TO THIS BEAUTIFUL SHOW? ARNOLD. BUT THINK ABOUT IT, WITH NO POLITICAL EXPERIENCE BEAT THE CLINTON DYNASTY, THE BUSH DYNASTY, THE PRESIDENT BARACK bb AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WORKED HARDER AT DEFEATING ME THEN CRICKET HILLARY CLINTON DEAD. HE WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. THE ONLY TIME I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN HIM WORK HARD, WHEN HE CAME TO TRY TO BEAT TRUMP. IT'S TRUE. REMEMBER, HE SAID, REMEMBER, HE SAID, HE WILL NOT BE PRESIDENT. THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL. THEN THEY FIGURE THEY COULD TAKE US OUT A VERY DIFFERENT WAY, VERY DISHONESTLY. WITH THE LYING AND SPYING AND LEAKING.AND WE ARE KICKING THEIR ASS. IN THE DELUSIONAL DEMOCRAT FANTASY I AM NOW SUPPOSED TO BE AFRAID OF SOMEONE CALLED ONE PERCENT JOE. I USED TO CALM ONE PERCENT JOE BECAUSE HE COULD NEVER GET ONE PERCENT OF THE PRIMARIES THAT HE GOT BROUGHT OUT BY OBAMA OUT OF THE TRASH HEAP. BECAME VICE PRESIDENT. BOWIE NOW NAMED HIM VERY SLOW SLEEPY JOE. VERY SLOW. HE'S GOTTEN SLOWER AND SLOWER, I'M AFRAID IF HE GETS A NOMINATION HE WILL BE SO SLOW WE WILL HAVE THE LOWEST RATE OF DEBATES IN HISTORY. AS OPPOSED TO THE HIGHEST RATED DEBATES IN HISTORY AGAINST CRICKET HILLARY. IN FACT, I DON'T EVEN THINK SLEEPY JOE WILL GET IT BUT MANY PEOPLE ARE RUNNING SO IT SO EARLY I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEIR CAMPAIGN. DID YOU HEAR, BETO O'ROURKE, DID YOU HEAR? POOR BETH bbHE'S PATHETIC. HE RAN AGAINST TED CRUZ, TED CRUZ WON. HE SPENT ALMOST $100 MILLION AND TED CRUZ AND I HELPED TED AND WE CAMPAIGNED TOGETHER BUT I USED TO WATCH HIM BUT WHEN HE CAME ONTO THE REALLY BIG STAGE THIS CRAZY STAGE I NOTICED HE WAS FLAILING WITH THE ARMS AND STANDING ON TABLES. HE WAS STANDING ON COUNTERTOPS. I SAID DOES HE EVER STAND ON THE FLOOR AND SPEAK? HE'S WAVING HIS ARMS GOING CRAZY AND I SAID, WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING? WHAT IS HE ON? REMEMBER HE MADE THE STATEMENTS THAT HE WAS BORN FOR THIS. ANYBODY THAT SAYS HE WAS BORN FOR THIS, THEY ARE IN TROUBLE. I USED TO HAVE GUYS COME INTO MY OFFICE, SIR, I'M THE GREATEST SALESMAN. THE TRUTH IS, ANYBODY THAT SAYS THEY'RE GREAT SALESMAN, USUALLY THEY ARE NOT A VERY GOOD SALESMAN. IT'S TRUE. IT'S THE SNEAKY ONES IN THE BACK THAT DON'T TALK. THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT, THEY ARE THE ONES. BUT BETO O'ROURKE, HE IS NASTY. HE SAID HE WAS BORN FOR IT. HE WAS BORN FROM HEAVEN HE CAME DOWN AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, SOME REALLY BAD THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU MADE A TOTAL FOOL OF HIMSELF. HE CAME OUT OF TEXAS, THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS. HE CAME OUT OF TEXAS A VERY HOT POLITICAL PROPERTY. AND HE WENT BACK AS COLD AS YOU CAN BE. HE WAS A NASTY GUY. HE HAD A COUPLE POLICIES THAT DON'T WORK WELL IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. HE WAS AGAINST RELIGION, HE WAS AGAINST YOU HAVING A GUN. AND HE WAS AGAINST OIL. YOU COME FROM TEXAS YOU DON'T LIKE RELIGION, YOU DON'T LIKE OIL AND YOU DON'T HAVE GUNS, THAT'S NOT A GOOD COMBINATION IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. THAT'S NOT GOOD IN MISSISSIPPI EITHER. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOOD ANYWHERE. HE WENT BACK HOME TO TEXAS AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE HEARING ABOUT HIM FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S AMAZING HOW COLBY CAN GET SO QUICKLY.HE WAS A NASTY GUY. OH, ALABAMA. I LOVE ALABAMA. I GRANDMA. IT'S A GREAT PLACE. BUT IN THE GRADE TWISTED AND CORRUPT WORLD OF ADAM SCHIFF, AFTER BEATING THE ENTIRE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT, AND THAT MEANS bbTHEY HAD MESUPPOSEDLY SENT TO MYSELF, LET'S SEE, I'VE GOT A GUY NAMED SLEEPY JOE BIDEN, KIND OF LIKE bbHOW DO I BEAT HIM? HOW DO I BEAT THIS GUY? HE IS SUCH A GREAT bbCLINTON WAS EASY. OBAMA WAS EASY. THE BUSH DYNASTY bbBUT SLEEPYJOE I'M WORRIED ABOUT. RIGHT? SO THEN I SAID TO MYSELF, GEE, I GUESS THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY. LET'S CALL UP UKRAINE FOR HELP. . THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. THESE DISHONEST PEOPLE WILL TAKE THE LAST LITTLE SLIVER IN THE FIRST LITTLE SLIVER AND THEY WILL PUT IT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO DAMNED DISHONEST AND SAY LET'S USE UP UKRAINE FOR HELP. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO SAY. IT WILL SHOW THE LAUGHTER AND THEY WILL SHOW THE SARCASM AND THEY WON'T SHOW THE PHONE BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST DISHONORABLE PEOPLE bbALMOST.IT'S A DISGRACE. BUT WE SAY IT ANYWAY. HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS, THE PEOPLE GET IT. SO THEY HAVE A BRAND-NEW PRESIDENT IN UKRAINE, GOOD GUY BY THE WAY. I'M ON A PHONE AND I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THE PHONE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU CALL THE LEADERS OF COUNTRY MANY PEOPLE LISTEN.I'M ON THE PHONE AND THEY WANT ME TO SAY TO THIS BRAND-NEW PRESIDENT WHO JUST GOT THERE, CALLED TO CONGRATULATE HIM, PLEASE, COULD YOU HELP ME? I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS AND I DIDN'T KNOW HIS NAME UNTIL I LOOKED DOWN THE CARD AND HE'S A NICE GUY AND HOPEFULLY IS GOING TO ROOT OUT CORRUPTION BECAUSE UKRAINE HAS TREMENDOUS CORRUPTION PROBLEMS. AND HOPEFULLY, ONE OF THE REASONS I HELD UP MONEY, VERY IMPORTANT, CORRUPTION. BUT THE OTHER REASON, WHY IS IT GERMANY AND FRANCE IN UK AND ALL THESE EUROPEAN NATIONS bb WHY ARE THEY DOING THINGS THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO? WHY IS IT ALWAYS THE UNITED STATES? SO I MADE THIS CALL, HAD THIS WONDERFUL CALL AND THE TRANSCRIPT PROVES IT WAS PERFECT. IT WAS PERFECT. IT WASN'T LIKED ALMOST, IT WAS PERFECT. IT WAS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE. I MADE IT AT THE BEHEST OF PEOPLE TO SAY COULD YOU CALL AND SAY HELLO? I'M AN HONEST PERSON ANYWAY BUT DO YOU THINK WHEN I'M MAKING A CALL TO A NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY THAT I WOULD SAY SOMETHING IMPROPER WHEN I KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE LISTENING ON THE LINE. MANY PEOPLE. ALL OF THESE PEOPLE, THE SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO, GREAT GUY, HE'S LISTENING. TRANSCRIBERS, FORTUNATELY, YOU HAVE POLICY EXPERTS, JUNIOR AIDS, LOW-LEVEL STAFFERS, PROBABLY APPRENTICE, WHOEVER THE HELL WANTS TO LISTEN, THEY LISTEN. THEY HAVE ME MAKING SOME KIND OF A DEAL WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE AND REMEMBER, THE NEW PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE IS SPEAKING TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PRESIDENT. I GUARANTEE HE'S GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE LISTENING TOO. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. CORRUPT POLITICIAN SHIFT THE ADAM SCHIFF STOOD BEFORE CONGRESS AND STOOD BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MADE UP A CONVERSATION THAT HE SAID I HAD WITH THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT. MANY PEOPLE SAW THAT AND IT WAS TERRIBLE. HE SAID TERRIBLE THINGS. THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE SAID IT WAS A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION. THERE WAS NO PRESSURE. THEY MUST THINK WE ARE NUTS, TO BE HONEST.IT'S ALL A PHONY DEAL THIS WHOLE IMPEACHMENT SCAM TO TRY TO UNDERMINE THE 2020 ELECTION AND DELEGITIMIZE ONE OF THE GREATEST ELECTIONS, MAY BE THE GREATEST. LET'S GIVE GEORGE WASHINGTON CREDIT. EVERYBODY EXPECTED HE WAS GOING TO WIN. MY PHONE CALL, WHICH WAS TOTALLY PERFECT AND APPROPRIATE AND IF YOU WANT TO READ THE TRANSCRIPT, YOU SEE HOW PERFECT IT WAS. BUT THEY DON'T QUIT. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT THE BEHAVIOR OF SLEEPY JOE. SO I QUOTE LET ME ACT LIKE HIM, I GOTTA SPEAK REALLY SLOW THOUGH. I SAID, YOU'RE NOT GETTING A BILLION, I LOOKED AT THEM AND I SAID, I'M LEAVING. IN SIX HOURS. IF THE PROSECUTOR ISN'T FIRED, YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE MONEY. YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE MONEY. HE GOES AT THE END, I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD THESE KIND OF ENERGY. HE SAID WELL, SOME OF IT bHEGOT FIRED. BY THE WAY, HE IS DROPPING LIKE A ROCK. WHEN YOU ARE AT ONE PERCENT, THERE'S ALWAYS A REASON. HE SHOULD BE THERE FAIRLY SOON. AS YOU KNOW, THE UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR THAT BIDEN GOT FIRED AFTER THREATENING TO WITHHOLD I THINK IT WAS $1 BILLION OR SOMETHING. WAS THE PROSECUTOR INVESTIGATING HIS SON'S COMPANY THAT WAS PAYING HUNTER BIDEN, A GUY JUST GOT THROWN OUT OF THE NAVY, HE WAS PAYING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVEN THOUGH WORKING FOR AN ENERGY COMPANY HE HAD NO EXPERIENCE WITH ENERGY. HE KNEW LESS ABOUT IT THEN THIS YOUNG, HOW OLD ARE YOU? SIX. THIS YOUNG BEAUTIFUL PERSON IN FRONT OF ME. SIX. IN THIS YOUNG SIX-YEAR-OLD IS SMARTER, I BASICALLY GO WITH HER. WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT? IT'S CALLED A PAYOFF. BUT THE FAKE NEWS, THEY APOLOGIZE. I WATCHED THIS HORRIBLE GUY, GIVES LOUSY RATINGS, ANDERSON COOPER. THE HATRED BETWEEN HIM AND FREDA YOU GOT FRITO. THAT'S CUOMO. FRITO. I CALL HIM FREDA LIKE FROM THE MOVIE. I WATCHED ANDERSON COOPER AND I WATCH HIM APOLOGIZE FOR EVEN ASKING THE QUESTION TO BIDEN. THE GOOD NEWS IS, BIDEN DIDN'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT WHAT THE HELL HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. REMEMBER BIDEN SAID, I DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE. HE NEVER SPOKE TO HIS SON ABOUT GETTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. NUMBER HE NEVER SPOKE TO bbWE ARE DEALING WITH LIFE. YOU NEVER SPOKE TO THEM. UNFORTUNATELY THE NEXT DAY, YOU KNOW THE WORLD OF THE INTERNET, AND THE WORLD OF SMART PEOPLE, THAT'S WHERE bbTHAT'S WHY BETO ISN'T SMART, HE TOLD OUR GREAT FIRST LADY TONIGHT, WHO PEOPLE LOVE. WHEN HE QUIT HE QUIT LIKE A DOG I SAID YOU SEE PEOPLE THINK THIS IS EASY, THIS ISN'T EASY. IT JUST WORKED OUT THAT WAY BUT BIDEN SAID, I NEVER MET THE PEOPLE, NEVER MET THE GENTLEMAN, UNFORTUNATELY IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS A PICTURE CAME OUT WHERE THEY ARE PLAYING GOLF TOGETHER. BUT HE NEVER MET. NOW YOU ASK HIM, WE PLAYED A ROUND OF GOLF WE WERE TOGETHER FOR THREE HOURS, AND NEVER MENTION THE FACT THEY ARE PAYING MY SON MILLIONS. CRAZY ANDERSON COOPER, LOUSY RATINGS. CNN, THE WORST, THE WORST. THE LIGHT JUST WENT OFF, YOU SEE! THE LIGHT WAS ON THEY JUST TURN IT OFF. THEY DON'T LIKE IT. IT'S TOUGH, FAKE CNN I TRIED NOT TO DO THAT BECAUSE I SEE THEIR LIGHT ON.WHEN LIGHT GOES ON THAT MEANS bbBUT INALL FAIRNESS, THE PICTA IS A BROADCAST, VERY FEW PEOPLE bb HERE'S THE THING, YOU HAVE THE GUY UP THERE SAYING THAT THEY ARE FAKE THAT THEY ARE NO GOOD. THAT THEY ARE LIARS AND CHEATERS. THAT THEY ARE PHONIES. IT'S HARD TO BE BROADCASTING THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NETWORK THAT HAS YOU ON. WE UNDERSTAND. THE LIGHTS OFF. AND THEN REMEMBER THIS, bbWASSO NICE, PRIOR TO RUNNING TO FOR POLITICS HE WAS SO NICE TO ME. I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM. HE'S A WEAK PERSON. BUT THEY ARE ALL WEEK. LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE NEED HONESTY WITH OUR MEDIA. WE NEED HONESTY. BECAUSE THE NEW YORK TIMES, THE WASHINGTON POST, AND BY THE WAY, YOU PROBABLY READ IT, WE THREW THEM OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE WE DON'T SHOW THEM ANYMORE. IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO GO WE THREW THEM OUT. THEY CAME INTO MY OFFICE AND I GOT TO IT BACK TO THE SKY, WHERE IS HUNTER? WHERE IS HUNTER? HE CAME OUT AND DID THE MORNING SHOW. THAT WAS THE LAST LEASING OF HUNTER. THAT WASN'T GOOD. THE MORNING OF HIS FATHER'S VERY BAD DEBATE. BEFORE I SAY THE FINAL THING ON HUNTER AND THEN WE PUT HIM TO REST FOR A WHILE, WE GET RID OF THE WASHINGTON POST AND THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES WE GET RID OF THEM. WE DON'T HAVE THEM IN THE WHITE HOUSE. PEOPLE CAN GO OUT AND BUY IT BUT WE DON'T HAVE IT. WE USED TO HAVE THEM STACKED UP. I GO IN AND SEE A MEETING WITH MY PEOPLE AND THEY ARE SOUTH KOREA OR SOMEBODY AND I GO IN AND GOING TO THESE OFFICES, I WOULD LOSE CLEC 10 OR 15 OF THEM PACKED ALL OVER THE PLACE. THE WASHINGTON POST, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHOSE WORKS. ONE DAY IT'S TIMES, ONE DAY IT'S SUPPOSED. THEY TAP EACH OTHER IS SO BAD, SO PHONY, IN MY OPINION, IT'S VIRTUALLY CORRUPT. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT. YOU NEVER HAVE A GOOD STORY. EVEN WHEN WE GOT ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI. LIKE HE WAS A RELIGIOUS PLAQUE. WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? IF OBAMA WOULD HAVE DONE IT. THIS GUY BUILT ISIS. THE CALIPHATE. IT WAS THE SIZE PHYSICALLY OF OHIO THE STATE OF OHIO THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO. THAT'S A LOT OF LAND. 7 MILLION PEOPLE AND THEY THE ONES THE ORANGE JUMPSUITS I CALLED ONE OF THE PARENTS AFTER WE DID THIS AND I TALKED TO THEM AND THEY WERE, HOW CAN YOU BE HAPPY? THEY WERE SO THRILLED THAT WE GOT THIS ANIMAL. THEY WERE SO THRILLED. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO IT BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT. STORY WAS A MASSIVE STORY THAT WAS THE BIGGEST MAYBE THE BIGGEST ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVER. BIGGER THAN ANYTHING. THAT STORY DISAPPEARED SO FAST. GONE. THAT'S OKAY I DIDN'T DO IT FOR THE STORY. I DID IT BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT IF I WERE A DEMOCRAT. IF I WERE A DEMOCRAT, THEY'D BE TALKING ABOUT THAT STORY FOR WEEKS. WITH ME, THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO COME OF THE ACTUALLY PLAYED IT DOWN. AND I'M HAPPY ABOUT THIS, CONAN THE DOG GOT MORE PUBLICITY THAN ME AND I'M VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT. CONAN THE INCREDIBLE. HE IS COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN A FEW WEEKS. DID YOU EVER SEE A STORY DISAPPEARED SO FAST? IF OBAMA HAD THAT STORY, THAT THEY WOULD BE GOING ON FOR ANOTHER SEVEN MONTHS. THEY BE TALKING ABOUT HIS BRAVERY. 142 JUDGES bbTHEY ALWAYS SAY, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THE PRESIDENT CAN DO IS FEDERAL JUDGES. WE GOT TWO SUPREME COURT'S. GREAT ONES. GORSUCH AND KAVANAUGH, GREAT JUDGES. DID YOU EVER SEE ANY HUMAN BEING TREATED WORSE THAN NOW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH? DID ANYBODY EVER? DID ANY HUMAN BEING BY THESE PEOPLE THESE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. JUST TO FINISH, HUNTER THEN GOES TO CHINA, NOW I'M DEALING WITH CHINA RIGHT NOW, THEY DON'T LIKE ME TOO MUCH. THEY DREAM ABOUT THE DAY WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE, AND WOULD THEY LIKE TO HAVE, HOW ABOUT THIS? YOU GET THIS SON WITH ZERO EXPERIENCE OF INVESTING GIVEN $1.5 BILLION TO INVEST, HE MAKES MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE BIGGEST GUYS AND WALL STREET GET IT, HE WALKS OUT WITH $1.5 BILLION AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER PLACES ALSO I UNDERSTAND, FOLKS, IT'S DISGRACEFUL THAT THE PRESS DOESN'T COVER IT FOR WHAT IT IS. IT'S A PAYOFF. AND HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE SLEEPY JOE WITH THIS SON GETTING ALL THIS MONEY FROM CHINA BECOME PRESIDENT AND TAKE OVER THE CHINA DEAL. THEY ARE NOT LIKING ME. THEY HAD THE WORST YEAR THEY'VE HAD IN 57 YEARS. THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS BROKEN UP LIKE SCRAMBLED EGGS. AND THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL BECAUSE THOSE TARIFFS ARE GIVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BILLIONS NOW, BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND YOU KNOW WE ARE DOING WITH SOME OF IT? JUST A SMALL PORTION BUT 100% TAKING CARE OF OUR FARMERS GOT $16 BILLION LAST YEAR. AND $12 BILLION THIS YEAR. BECAUSE THEY TARGETED OUR FARMERS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE FARMERS LOG TRUMP AND THE TRUE FARMERS LOVE TROUT.THEY TARGETED THEM AND BROUGHT THE 16 DOLLARS DOWN TO PRACTICALLY NOTHING AND THEY THOUGHT THE FARMERS WOULD SAY, WE DON'T LIKE TRUMP, THEY DID THE OPPOSITE, THEY SAID WE KNOW HE'S DOING THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE WE BEEN RIPPED OFF FOR SO MANY YEARS. I SAID TO SECRETARY ABOUT THE AGRICULTURE, I SAID HOW MUCH DID THEY SPEND BUYING OUR CORN AND SOYBEANS AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS? HE SAID, SIR, $16 BILLION. I SAID GOOD, I WILL MAKE IT UP AND WE WILL HAVE A LOT LEFT OVER. WE WILL HAVE PRETTY SOON OVER $100 BILLION IN MONEY PAID INTO THE UNITED STATES TREASURY BY A COUNTRY THAT NEVER GAVE US $0.10. THEY ONLY TOOK. WHEN I SAID TO THE FARMERS, WE ARE GOING TO SEND YOU $16 BILLION AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN SPLIT IN THE $12 MILLION THE YEAR BEFORE. THINK ABOUT THAT, $28 BILLION, AS IT COMPLEMENTS OF CHINA. AND WE HAD A LOT LEFT OVER, NOT BAD. NOT BAD. YOU THINK OBAMA WOULD DO THAT? I DON'T THINK SO. YOU THINK HILLARY DID WOULD DO THAT? I DON'T THINK SO. YOU THINK SLEEPY JOE WOULD DO THAT? I DON'T THINK SO. HE WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ON TUESDAY THE PROUD PEOPLE OF MISSISSIPPI WILL SEND DEMOCRATS A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THIS REASON AS WELL AS THE FACT YOU GOT A GREAT GENTLEMAN IN YOUR MIDST. BUT YOU HAVE TO REJECT THEIR EXTREMISM AND THEIR SOCIALISM AND THEIR CORRUPTION THAT CORRUPT, ADAM SCHIFF IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN. WHEN HE MADE THE PHONY SPEECH, WHAT HE MADE UP HIS BARELY HORRIBLE SPEECH AND SAID THAT I SAID IT. I SAID I'M GOING TO SUE HIM, THEY SAID SURE, I'M SORRY CAN'T. YOU GOT TOTAL IMMUNITY BECAUSE HE MADE IT IN CONGRESS. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS, AT LEAST WE HAVE A FORUM. WE HAVE A PLACE WE CAN TALK SO EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON. A BUNCH OF PHONY PEOPLE BUT THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO SEND THE SIGNAL AND WHY YOU HAVE TO MAKE bb HE'S A GREAT GUY TOO. ALL I KNOW IS HE IS LOVED AND RESPECTED BY YOUR CURRENT GOVERNOR. BECAUSE PHIL IS SOME PIECE OF WORK. PHIL IS SO CONFIDENT, I WANTED PHIL TO RUN FOR CERTAIN OFFICES AND I WANTED HIM TO DO bbI TRIED TO GET HIM. SOME GUYS bbHE SAID NO SIR I'VE BEEN DOING THIS MY WHOLE LIFE I LOVE THE PEOPLE. HE BUILT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AFRICAN-AMERICAN MUSEUM. HE IS THE GREATEST. HE BUILT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL bb HE'S GOT CONFIDENCE. HE SAID, NO, SIR, I'VE BEEN DOING IT I DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO THIS. MOST PEOPLE ARE SO INSECURE, THEY KEEP GOING AND GOING AND GOING, bb REALLY A CHAMPION FOR MISSISSIPPI VALUES AND TATE HELP CUP YOUR TAXES OVER 50 TIMES INCLUDING THE LARGEST TAX CUT IN MISSISSIPPI HISTORY. TATE, PRO-WORKER, PRO-JOBS, PRO-FAMILIES, PRO-LIFE. TATE IS A TRUE LEADER IN THE FIGHT TO PROTECT THE UNBORN. THE OTHER SIDE IS NOT. TATE TO REEVES WILL SUPPORT OUR POLICE, UPLOAD SANCTUARY CLIQUES WHO LOVE OUR POLICE. I LOVE OUR POLICE. WE LOVE OUR POLICE. OPPOSE SANCTUARY CITIES, WHICH IS JUST TERRIBLE. THEY ARE TERRIBLE. AND TATE WILL ALWAYS DEFEND YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. TATE IS RUNNING AGAINST A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT NAMED JIM HOOD. ALL I KNOW ABOUT JIM HOOD IS HE FOUGHT VERY HARD TO ELECT CRICKET HILLARY CLINTON AND BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA. HE WANTED OBAMA TO WIN SO BADLY AND THEN HE WANTED HILLARY TO WIN AND THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF GUY WE NEED HERE, NOT MISSISSIPPI. HE SUPPORTED BY EXTREME LEFTISTS LIKE STACEY ABRAMS, WHO BY THE WAY WENT DOWN TO DEFEAT IN FRONT OF A TERRIFIC GENTLEMAN FROM THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA, BRIAN KEMP. AND THEY CAME IN WITH, THEY BROUGHT THEM ALL. THEY HAD PRESIDENT OBAMA, THEY HAD MICHELLE OBAMA, THEY HAD OPRAH WINFREY, AND ALL HE HAD WAS bbAND WE WON. VERY EASILY. BUT STACEY ABRAMS WANT TO GIVE ILLEGAL ALIENS THE RIGHT TO VOTE. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? SOME OF THESE PEOPLE THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM EDUCATION THEY WANT TO GIVE HIM THIS, THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM FREE HEALTHCARE THEY WANT TO GET THESE PEOPLE THAT COME INTO OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY MORE ADVANTAGES THAN OUR OWN CITIZENS HAVE. MORE ADVANTAGES THAN OUR OWN MILITARY HAVE. JIM HOOD WANTS TO RAISE THE TAXES. HE SUPPORTS TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABORTION PROVIDERS. HE SUPPORTS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION THE WHOLE BENEFITS. AND HE OPPOSED OUR TRAVEL BAN WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE RUN IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT TO KEEP TERRORISTS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. JIM HOOD WENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS AND OPPOSED YOUR RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE. IF YOU DON'T WANT A FAR LEFT DEMOCRAT RUNNING MISSISSIPPI, WAIT A MINUTE, HOW IS THIS GUY bbI CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS A COMPETITIVE RACE. IT'S EMBARRASSING. I'M TALKING MISSISSIPPI. I'M TALKING TO MISSISSIPPI. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I WILL THINK THAT HE'S GOING TO BE THE RIGHT GUY. I THINK THE GUY THAT YOU WANT IS TATE REEVES. HE'S GONNA BE FANTASTIC. HE WILL BE A GREAT GREAT GOVERNOR. TATE, COME ON UP. THANK YOU TATE, TUESDAY GO OUT AND BUT FOR TATE, HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN. DON'T KID YOURSELF, YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT IS UNDER ATTACK. THAT WITH HIM, IT'S UNDER ATTACK. WE ARE ALSO JOINED TONIGHT BY A MAN WHO IS TRULY I'VE SAID A LOT, HE HAS BEEN A GREAT GOVERNOR AND HE LOVES YOUR STATE AND HE LOVES THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT STATE, GOVERNOR PHIL BRIAN, WHERE IS PHIL? COME UP PHIL. COME UP PHIL. THANK YOU PHIL. THANK YOU MY PHIL. WHAT A GREAT JOB. TO CONTINUE THAT WHOLE THING GOING FORWARD. ANOTHER MAN WHO IS A WARRIOR A FRIEND OF MINE. WHENEVER THERE IS A PROBLEM HE IS THERE HE IS ALWAYS THERE HE WILL BE RIGHT AT THE FRONT, HE IS TOUGH, SMART, BRILLIANT ACTUALLY. AND HE LOVES THIS STATE AND HE LOVES YOU PEOPLE. SENATOR ROGER WICKER. ROGER. THANK YOU ROGER. SOMEBODY I WILL CALL HER UP BECAUSE BELIEVE IT OR NOT SHE'S RUNNING WITH ME. SHE JUST RAN I SAID SIDNEY YOU JUST RAN YOU JUST WON. SHE SAID NO I HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN. SHE'S RUNNING IN 2020. I THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE LIKE SIX YEARS I SAID CINDY, IT'S ONLY LIKE A YEAR. CINDY HYDE SMITH, SHE'S INCREDIBLE. SHE'S TOUGH AND SMART AND STRONG AND SHE IS WITH US ALL THE WAY. CINDY HYDE SMITH. IS THIS GUY INCREDIBLE OR WHAT? GREAT JOB. FANTASTIC WOMAN. ALSO WITH US TWO TERRIFIC FRIENDS OF MINE. MIKE ROGER AND LIKE CINDY HYDE SMITH WHO'S LIKE ALL OF THEM. IN TATE HE'S GIVEN ME RIGHT THERE WITH US. ALL FIGHTING TOGETHER. TWO INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. TRENT KELLY, MICHAEL INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. YOUR NEXT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR YOUR NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL LYNN FITCH. YOUR NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE MICHAEL WATSON. GREAT PEOPLE. YOUR NEXT STATE TREASURER DAVID McRAE. STATE AUDITOR SHED WHITE. AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER ANDREW GIBSON. INSURANCE COMMISSIONER MIKE CHANEY AND FORMER GOVERNOR A MAN THAT NOBODY'S EVER HEARD OF IN THIS ROOM. BUT THE TRUTH IS, HE'S A LEGEND IN POLITICS AND A GREAT GUY HE'S A GREAT GUY. HALEY BARBOUR. GREAT GUY. WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE HERE WE ARE THE HOTTEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, WE CREATED OVER 6.7 MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION. THAT I WOULD CREATE 6.7 NEW JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION THESE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GONE CRAZY. THEY WOULD'VE SAID HORRIBLE THINGS. THEY WOULD'VE SAID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED THE LOWEST RATE IN OVER 51 YEARS. SOON TO BE HISTORIC. AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT JUST DROPPED TO THE LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED HISTORIC. REALLY UNIMPORTANT TO ME. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE LOOKED AT 55,000 MISSISSIPPI RESIDENTS OUT OF POVERTY. HOURLY EARNINGS ARE UP NINE PERCENT IN MISSISSIPPI SINCE THE ELECTION. UNDER THE PREVIOUS TWO ADMINISTRATIONS WE LOST 60,000 FACTORIES IN OUR COUNTRY UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION WE'VE ALREADY ADDED NEARLY 10,000 NEW FACTORIES AND MANY MORE ARE COMING IN. TO GET RELIEF TO WORKING FAMILIES WE PASSED MASSIVE TAX CUTS ON AVERAGE $2000-$2500 PER FAMILY. BRINGING ALMOST $1 TRILLION BACK HOME TO OUR IT SHOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING BIG COMPANIES CAN GET THEIR MONEY BACK. BOTH BUREAUCRATICALLY AND FROM A TAX STANDPOINT. THEY BROUGHT BACK ALMOST $1 TRILLION BECAUSE OF US. ALL PUT TO WORK. WE/THE LARGEST NUMBER IN HISTORY OF TOP REGULATIONS AND WE ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY WE ARE NOW THE NUMBER ONE REDUCER OF ENERGY BY FAR ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. FOR DECADES USED CORRUPT POLITICIANS TAKE MONEY FROM LOBBYISTS TO IMPOSE CATASTROPHIC TRADE VIEW. MISSISSIPPI LOST 40% OF ALL MANUFACTURING JOBS AFTER THE TWIN DISASTERS OF NAFTA AND CHINA'S ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, TWO OF THE WORST DEALS EVER MADE BY OUR COUNTRY. 100,000 MISSISSIPPI JOBS WERE WIPED AWAY JUST LIKE THAT. THAT'S A BIG PRICE TO PAY FOR WASHINGTON'S DISLOYALTY TO THE AMERICAN WORKER. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.IT WAS DISLOYALTY STUPIDITY. CORRUPTION. LOTS OF REASONS. NOW YOU FINALLY HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO'S LOYAL TO YOU AND I AM. I'M A FIGHTER FOR YOUR JOBS, YOUR WAGES, YOUR FACTORIES YOUR FAMILIES AND DIGNITY WE ARE STOPPING CHINA FROM RIPPING US OFF. WE ARE STOPPING ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE LOSE OUR MONEY, WE LOSE OUR WEALTH WE LOSE OUR JOBS WE CLOSE UP FACTORIES, THAT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE. IT'S REVERSED. WE WERE THE SUCKER COUNTRY FOR YEARS AND YEARS BUT WE ARE NOT THE SUCKER COUNTRY ANYMORE AND THEY ALL KNOW IT. WE ARE REPLACING NAFTA AND THAT WAS A DISASTER, NAFTA. WITH THE BRAND-NEW U.S. MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT OF NANCY PELOSI WILL EVER PUT IT UP TO A VOTE. WHICH IS QUESTIONABLE. NERVOUS NANCY. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY VICTORY. SHE'S VERY BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS, HAVING FUN. THE US MCA WOULD BE A MASSIVE VICTORY FOR MISSISSIPPI FARMERS AND ALSO INCLUDES POWERFUL PROJECTIONS FOR MISSISSIPPI AUTOWORKERS MANUFACTURERS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. THE GREAT AGREEMENT. ABOUT TIME WE GOT RID OF NAFTA. THE DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS NEED TO STOP THEIR MADNESS AND PASS THE US MCA RIGHT NOW. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE U.S. OIL INDUSTRY. UNDER OUR POLICIES TOYOTA HAS JUST ANNOUNCED A $170 MILLION INVESTMENT IN MISSISSIPPI bb DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THIS PLACE? BLUE SPRINGS. BEFORE MY ELECTION OUR LEADERS USED THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS AS A PIGGYBACK TO FUND THEIR DELUSIONAL GLOBAL PRODUCTS ALL OVER THE WORLD. WE TAKE CARE OF OTHER COUNTRIES BUT WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN. THEY KNOWINGLY DECIMATED AMERICAN MANUFACTURING TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THEY DEPLOYED OUR MILITARY TO PROTECT, IMMENSELY WEALTHY NATIONS SUBSIDIZING THEIR WELFARE STATES WITH YOUR MONEY I ASK THOSE WEALTHY NATIONS NOW, AND RESPECTFULLY THE OTHER DAY SAID TO THE KING OF SAUDI ARABIA. WE WILL HELP YOU BUT YOU GOT TO PAY. HE WAS GREAT BUT NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED BEFORE. WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT'S BEN'S BILLIONS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BUT WE SAID YOU ARE VERY WEALTHY YOU HAVE TO PAY. THAT'S TRUE WITH MANY COUNTRIES BY THE WAY. THEY NEVER RESPECTED US THEY COULD NEVER BELIEVE IT. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN. HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE COULDN'T REALLY ANSWER IT. BECAUSE HOW THE HELL DID THIS HAPPEN. ASK CHINA HOW MANY COUNTRIES ARE YOU PROTECTING? PRESIDENT XI. THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE WHAT A STUPID QUESTION. HOW MANY COUNTRIES YOU PROTECTING PRESIDENT PUTIN. HE LOOKS AND HE GOES, RUSSIA. WE ARE PROTECTING AT LEAST 94. THERE ARE SO MANY THEY CAME AND TOLD ME. I BEEN TRYING TO GET AN ANSWER FOR FOUR MONTHS. IT'S ALL BEAUTIFUL THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING. THE SAME POLITICIANS FOR PRECIOUS AMERICAN BLOOD AND TREASURE INTO THE SANDS OF THE MIDDLE EAST. OUR FAILED RULING CLASS WAS THEIR RIGHT TO RULE OVER YOU TO TAKE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR JOBS AND REDISTRIBUTE YOUR WEALTH ALL OF THE GLOBE WHEREVER THEY WANTED IT BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT. OUT LIKE THAT. THE GREAT SELLOUT HAS ENDED AND IT ENDED IT ENDED TODAY I TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE. AFTER YEARS OF BUILDING UP FOREIGN NATIONS WE ARE FINALLY BUILDING UP OUR NATION. WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. OUR POLICY OF NEVER ENDING WAR. THE REGIME CHANGE IN NATIONBUILDING BY THE CLEAR PURSUIT OF AMERICAN INTEREST. IT'S THE JOB OF ALL MILITARY TO PROTECT OUR SECURITY NOT TO BE THE POLICEMAN OF THE WORLD PROVING THE WISDOM OF THIS APPROACH WE RECENTLY SECURED A PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE IN NORTHERN SYRIA WITHOUT SPILLING ONE DROP OF AMERICAN bI HAVETO BE HONEST ONE SOLDIER STEPPED ON A NAIL. IT'S TRUE. I SAID DON'T TELL THE PRESS THAT BECAUSE I SAID DON'T MENTION IT PLEASE. THEY ALWAYS LIKE TO IMAGINE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. TAKE IT A LITTLE LOW-KEY. NOT A DROP OF BLOOD. AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DEFEND DAVID FIGHTING FOR A THOUSAND YEARS. BUT WE DID KEEP THE OIL IF YOU DON'T MIND, WE KEPT THE OIL. WE WILL HELP OUT OURSELVES IF THAT'S OKAY. THEN THEY DEMANDED AMERICAN CITIZENS EXCEPT UNLIMITED MIGRATION FROM THOSE TEAR AFFLICTED NATIONS AND REGIONS. I DON'T THINK SO. WE DID NOT FIGHT THEM OVER THERE. ONLY TO INVITE THEM OVER HERE. WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES BY ADMINISTRATION RESTRICTED MIGRATION FROM TERROR PRONE NATIONS AND IMPLEMENTED THE TOUGHEST EVER VETTING PROCEDURES. NO ISSUE HAS EVER BEEN SO HORRIBLY DISCARDED BY A PARTY AS THAT ISSUE BY THE DEMOCRATS. THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS, WHICH MEAN CRIME. THEY WANT TO SANCTUARY CITIES, WHICH MEANS CRIMES AND DRUGS AND bbAFTER PLEADING THE MIDDLE-CLASS DRIVE, DEMOCRATS THROUGH OPEN OUR BORDERS TO THE WORLD FLOODING OUR COMMUNITIES WITH POISONOUS DRUGS AND CRIMINAL CARTELS. PUBLICANS BELIEVE IN STRONG BORDERS AND SAFE COMMUNITIES. WE ARE NOW BUILDING A WALL. YOU THINK THAT'S EASY, THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T WANT THAT, I GOT MONEY FOR EVERYTHING BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE WALL ABOUT $0.10. NOT $0.10. BUT WE GAVE THE MILITARY A LOT OF MONEY AND WE TOOK IT FROM THE MILITARY AND WE TOOK IT FROM YOU WE TOOK IT FROM THERE WE HAD TO GO TO COURT IN ALL THE SUDDEN WE STARTED WINNING CASES. THE WORLD IS GOING UP RAPIDLY. IT'S GOING UP RAPIDLY THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS WORLD. EVERYTHING THEY WANTED TO THEY WENT TO THE BORDER PATROL INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THEY SAID GIVE ME THE SPECIFICATION. THEY SAID WE WOULD LIKE STEEL BUT WE WOULD ALSO LIKE CAN'T TAKE. I SAID WHICH ONE YOU WANT? I DID ALL THREE. BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT FORM. WE'VE GOT IT ALL. WE ALSO NEED SEE-THROUGH SERVE. IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE WHAT WE ARE DOING BUT WE SHOULD HAVE ANYWHERE FROM 400 TO ALMOST 500 MILES OF WALL BUILT BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR. IN ALL THE RIGHT AREAS. IN ALL THE RIGHT AREAS. IT WAS A TOUGH ONE. AND THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IS BUILDING THEIR HEARTS OUT. THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. WE BELIEVE IN KEEPING TERRORIST CRIMINALS AND DRUG DEALERS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER, ILLEGAL CROSSINGS HAVE DROPPED 60% SINCE MAY AND WE ARE FASTER THAN EVER SECURING THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND SOON IT WILL BE WHEN THE WALL IS COMPLETED, SECURED LIKE IT'S NEVER BEEN BEFORE. AND I WANT TO THANK THE COUNTRY OF MEXICO, THEY RIGHT NOW HAVE 27,000 SOLDIERS ON OUR BORDERS AND 27,000, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? THEY ARE KEEPING PEOPLE OUT AND I WANT TO THINK THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO IS AN EXCELLENT PERSON, GREAT MAN. AND WE APPRECIATE IT AND THE REASON IS THAT THE DEMOCRATS WON'T EVEN APPROVE THINGS CALLED LOOPHOLES. LOOPHOLES, THAT'S A HORRIBLE NAME, THAT MEANS IT'S A LOOPHOLE THAT MEANS YOU CAN COME IN ILLEGALLY AND LOTS OF THINGS, CATCH AND RELEASE. YOU CATCH, AND YOU GOT TO RELEASE THEM. BY LAW YOU HAVE TO RELEASE THEM. THEY WILL ARREST THE BORDER PATROL AGENT IF THEY DON'T b BUT WE COULD END THIS IN 15 MINUTES BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT. THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT. THEY ARE OBSTRUCTION, POLLUTERS AND WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO GO WITH TATE REESE. TATE IS GOING TO SEND A BIG SIGNAL BY THE WAY. IT'S GREAT FOR YOU, HE'S GONNA BE A GREAT GOVERNOR IT ALSO SENDS A BIG SIGNAL TO THESE RADICAL LEFT CRAZY DEMOCRATS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT TATE WINS. VERY IMPORTANT. WE ARE ALSO FIGHTING DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES WITH THE HELP OF STATES LIKE MISSISSIPPI, WHICH HAS BANNED SANCTUARY CITIES BECAUSE PHIL BRIAN SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THEM AND ROGER WICKER SAYS WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THEM. AND CINDY SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THEM. DEMOCRATS, SANCTUARY CITIES, FORCE THE RELEASE OF DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS ONTO OUR SPACE. IF YOU WANT A GOVERNOR WHO WILL STAND PROUDLY WITH THE HEROES OF I.C.E. I WOULD WANT THEIR JOB. MS 13 THEY WALK RIGHT INTO THOSE NESTS. THEY START SWINGING YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT. I SAID, BETTER YOU THAN ME, WHO WOULD DO GOOD? THAT GUY WOULD DO GOOD, MOST OF YOU WOULDN'T DO SO GOOD BACK THESE GUYS ARE TOUGH GUYS AND THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY. WHO WOULD DO IT? THEY ARE MOVING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM MS 13 THESE GANGS ARE THE WORST PEOPLE. THESE PEOPLE THESE ARE NOT HUMAN BEINGS. I SAID THAT ONCE BEFORE THIS CRAZY NANCY PELOSI SAID HOW DARE YOU SAY THEY ARE NOT bb HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THEM? THEY SLICED PEOPLE UP WITH A KNIFE BECAUSE IT'S MORE PAINFUL THAN USING A GUN. THEN I HAVE TO DEFEND MYSELF WHEN I SAY THEY ARE ANIMALS BUT I NEVER CHANGED I DIDN'T SAY I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE, I LIKE TO APOLOGIZE CRAZY NANCY. YOU LOOK AT HER DISTRICT IN SAN FRANCISCO, SHE SPENDING ALL HER TIME ON THIS CRAP FOR THIS IMPEACHMENT STUFF. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE GREAT CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. IT'S THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF TENTS AND DRUGS AND NEEDLES AND EVERYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE FLOATING IN THE STREETS IN THE BEST NEIGHBORHOODS, NANCY PELOSI, GO HOME AND FIX HER DISTRICT NANCY. GO HOME AND FIX HER DISTRICT. GO HOME AND FIX HER DISTRICT. IF YOU WANT A GOVERNOR WHO WILL STAND PROUDLY WITH THE HEROES OF I.C.E. AND BORDER PATROL VOTE FOR TATE REEVES. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME. THE DEMOCRATS HEALTHCARE AGENDA WOULD HELP OBLITERATE MEDICARE. I WILL ALWAYS PROTECT MEDICARE FOR OUR SENIORS. WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. ALWAYS. WE WILL ALWAYS. VIRTUALLY EVERY DEMOCRAT ALSO NOW SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION. RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB. RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA EXECUTED A BABY, REMEMBER THAT WHOLE THING? AFTER BIRTH. AFTER BIRTH. SOME PEOPLE NEVER HEARD OF IT. HE SAID THE BABY IS BORN AND THEN HE STARTS TALKING TO THE MOTHER. NOBODY EVER HEARD OF THAT. THAT'S WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTIONS, SOCIALISM AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER THE AMERICAN FAMILY. THE AMERICAN DREAM. NOBODY HAS DONE MORE FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY THEN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND ALSO THE PARTY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. PEOPLE FORGET. ABRAHAM LINCOLN, HONEST ABE. WE CREATED OPPORTUNITIES SO INCREDIBLE, SO SUCCESSFUL. INCLUDING 100 NEW OPPORTUNITIES ZONES RIGHT NOW IN MISSISSIPPI WHERE MONEY IS NOW FLOWING INTO BUILD AND FIX AND TIM SCOTT, I GIVE HIM SO MUCH CREDIT FROM THE GREAT STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. WE PASS THE VA CHOICE NBA ACCOUNTABILITY OF OUR GREAT BETTERS. VA CHOICE. OUR VETERANS ARE WAITING ON LINES DAYS AND WEEKS SOMETIMES. NOW THEY CAN GO OUT AND GET A DOCTOR, WE PAY THE BILL AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT SIX WEEKS, FOUR WEEKS, TWO WEEKS WE HAVE PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE THEY WERE VERY SICK. BY THE TIME THEY SAW THE DOCTOR, THEY WERE TERMINALLY ILL. NOW THEY GO ON AND THEY GO OUTSIDE AND THEY FIND A DOCTOR. WE TAKE CARE OF OUR GREAT VETERANS. TO PROTECT AMERICAN SECURITY I WOULD WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE HORRIBLE ONE CENTERED AROUND NUCLEAR TEARFUL DEAL. NOTHING EASY BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME I RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL THAT OPEN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. FOR YEARS YOU WATCHED AS POLITICIANS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA, NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF MISSISSIPPI. THE NEXT STEP TO VICTORY BEGINS TUESDAY RIGHT HERE IN YOUR GREAT STATE WITH YOUR SUPPORT. WE WILL SHOW THE CORRUPT DEMOCRATS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT EVER GOING TO BACK DOWN FROM PERHAPS THE GREATEST VICTORY IN POLITICAL HISTORY. TODAY WITH THE NEW STOCK MARKET AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH AND WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING IF WE DIDN'T WIN THIS ELECTION, THAT STOCK MARKET WOULD BE AND ONE HALF IT WAS HEADED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IT WAS GOING TO FAIL. IF THEY EVER DO ANYTHING BAD TO US IF THEY EVER SUCCEED IN THEIR WILDEST DREAM, WHICH WE WILL NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN. THAT STOCK MARKET WILL CRASH LIKE YOU NEVER SEEN A CRASH BEFORE. AND YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY WITH YOUR 401 LIKE YOU ARE NOW. BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THE LEADERSHIP THEY HAVE NO CLUE. VERY VICIOUS PEOPLE. ACTUALLY THEY ARE SORT OF MENTALLY VIOLENCE PEOPLE. BUT WE'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL. IT ALWAYS HELPS WHEN YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG. I ALWAYS SAY, HOW YOU IMPEACH A PRESIDENT WHO DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG? WE ARE GOING TO SEND A SIGNAL BY SENDING IT A TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR TO JACKSON. ON TUESDAY YOU GET OUT AND YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE AND YOU GOING TO GIVE UP WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP YOU WILL LEAVE WORK MAY BE A LITTLE EARLY OR GET THERE A LITTLE LATE TELL YOUR BOSS I SAID IT WAS OKAY. I WILL GIVE YOU A PARDON IF I HAVE TO. I WILL GIVE YOU A ONE HOUR PARDON. WITH YOUR HELP WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR GREAT CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK. TOGETHER WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR SAFE SAYING UNLAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION AND YOU HAVE GREAT CONGRESSMEN HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU, I APPRECIATE IT FELLOW WARRIORS.YOU ARE WARRIORS. WHAT WAS IT 196 FOUR AND NOTHING AGAINST. IT NEVER HAPPENS. ..... THANK YOU DARLING APPRECIATE IT. YOUR RESERVATIONS, BUT HAVE A TENDENCY TO SPLIT APART, THE RATS DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A NET REMEDIES. WE DO. MAYBE HE WILL GET BETTER. WE'LL SEE. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. MAYBE HE WILL GET BETTER. JUST WANT TO BE FAIR. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT. WE WILL ENACT TRADE DEALS THE RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS, PROBABLY STABBED WITH THOSE BEAUTIFUL WORDS MADE IN THE USA, MADE IN AMERICA, WE WILL RECEIVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE INVITING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT. WITHIN TEN YEARS. IT WILL BE OVER. WHEN THEY COME ABOUT, POINTED IN THE AIDS EPIDEMIC, IT'S FUNDED. NOBODY KNEW WHO IT COULD THAT BUT WE ARE DOING IT. WE'LL HAVE IT ENDED IN AMERICA THE AIDS AND THE DEBT EPIDEMIC WILL BE ENDED IN TEN YEARS. WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT. PREVIOUS BEACH AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. LOOPHOLE WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING, FOR THE SACRED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER IS ONE AMERICA. WE SUPPORT AND PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. CARMACK WE STAY ON WITHIN THE INCREDIBLE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIVE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRACY. THEY ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND HONOR OUR HISTORY AND TO ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG.

         "I WANT TO THANK YOU NORTH CAROLINA WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I AM THRILLED TO BE BACK IN THE GREAT CITY OF CHARLOTTE. WERE BY THE WAY WE ARE HAVING OUR CONVENTION, I GUESS YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT? WHERE THOUSANDS OF HARDWORKING AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO LOVE OUR COUNTRY SHARES OUR VALUES, RESPECT OUR LAWS, AND ALWAYS PUT AMERICA FIRST. FEW EIGHT MONTHS FROM NOW, WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT THE RADICAL SOCIALISTS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE GREAT STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA AND ALLIANCE AT LANDSLIDE. WE WANT IT WE WENT LAST TIME, WE WILL WIN THIS TIME. AND YOU KNOW, ERIC AND LAURA NAMED THEIR DAUGHTER. YOU KNOW WHAT HER NAME IS? CAROLINA. HER LAME IS CAROLINE FOR REASON. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE TIME FOR OUR NATION. OUR COUNTRY IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. AND TODAY WE JUST HAD THE LARGEST ONE DAY INCREASE IN THE STOCK MARKET IN HISTORY. THAT'S GREAT. OUR OPPONENTS WERE SAYING OH MAYBE THE ECONOMY MAYBE MAYBE THEY'LL DO ANYTHING. I AM SURE THEY WERE THRILLED. DO YOU THINK OUR OPPONENTS WERE THRILLED WHEN THEY SAW THE STOCK MARKET? I DON'T THINK SO. BY THE WAY LOOK AT THIS. LOOK BACK THERE. LOOK AT ALL OF THAT PRESS. I DON'T KNOW SLEEPY JOE OR BERNIE HAD THAT MUCH PRESS. BERNIE WAS GOING WILD. WHY WOULD I BE HERE TONIGHT? WHY WOULD I BE HERE? HE SAID WHY WOULD I BE HERE TONIGHT? WE DON'T HAVE THE PRIMARY. WE'VE ALREADY WON THE THING YOU KNOW. I WAS GOING TO SAY THERE YOU KNOW WHAT THING BUT I HELD IT BACK BECAUSE THEY'LL SAY HORRIBLE LANGUAGE THEY WILL USE HORRIBLE LANGUAGE. BUT WE ARE DOING FANTASTICALLY. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WERE SO UNIFIED AS IT IS NOW. NEVER EVER. YOU KNOW YOU HEAR ABOUT ENTHUSIASM FOR CRAZY BERNIE AND THAT IS TRUE HE DOES HAVE SOME ENTHUSIASM BUT MUCH LESS THAN WE HAVE AND A MUCH SMALLER GROUP OF PEOPLE TO. THERE IS NOT A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM THERE IS NOT A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM FOR BIDEN. I THOUGHT HE GAVE UP THE PRESIDENCY BECAUSE HE SAID HE'S RUNNING FOR THE SENATE. I LOOKED AT THE FIRST LADY AND SAID HEY HE'S RUNNING FOR THE SENATE. AND TODAY HE JUST SAID, SUPER THURSDAY, HE IS LOOKING FOR TO SUPER THURSDAY. JOBS ARE BOOMING IN OUR COUNTRY. IN COMES THE SOARING. POVERTY IS PLUMMETED. CONFIDENCE IS SURGING AND WE HAVE COMPLETELY REBUILT THE AWESOME POWER OF A THING CALLED THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. AND EVERY DAY FOR ME AND FOR YOU IT'S PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. EVERY DAY. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROMISES I'VE MADE, IS RIGHT TO THIS ERA, WE LOOK AT IT, IT'S THE NEVER ENDING WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WE ARE TAKING OUR SOLDIERS. WE ARE BRINGING THEM BACK HOME. WE ARE NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ARE BRINGING THEM BACK HOME. AMERICAN TROOPS CANNOT BE THE POLICEMAN FOR THE WORLD, OR TO CREATE DEMOCRACY AND OTHER NATIONS AND FRANKLY PROBABLY DON'T WANT IT. THE TOP OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY IS TO SECURE AND DEFEND OUR COUNTRY. ... ... TWO DATES AGO THE UNITED STATES SIGNED A DEAL WITH THE TALIBAN AFTER 19 YEARS OF CONFLICT AND VERY CLOSE TO 20. WE CAN FINALLY BEGIN TO BRING OUR AMAZING TROOPS BACK HOME. AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING FOREIGN NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY BUILDING OUR NATION AND TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN AMERICAN CITIZENS. AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE, WE'VE WIPED OUT TERRORISM, WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ARE 8000 MILES AWAY. YOU GOT A LOT OF BIG COUNTRIES SURROUNDING AFGHANISTAN. YOU HAVE AFGHANISTAN ITSELF. THE PROGRESS THERE WAS MADE, WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE EXTRAORDINARY BALLOR OF OUR MEN AND OUR WOMEN IN UNIFORM. YOU KNOW THAT. AND WE PAY A SPECIAL TRIBUTE AND I KNOW YOU PAY IT. A SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO OUR GREAT WOUNDED WARRIORS AND THOSE WHO MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. AS WE BRING BACK OUR TROOPS WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURE THAT FOREIGN TERRORISTS ARE DENIED ADMISSION TO AMERICA AND THE FIRST PLACE. THEY ARE NOT COMING HERE, AND IF THEY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO THEM. WE MUST KEEP RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. BY THE WAY I HAVE TO SAY THIS. YOU HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE, AND SOMEBODY WAS SAYING THAT IF POCAHONTAS OR ANYONE OF THEM, SLEEPY JOE, HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT, BUT IF SLEEPY JOE OR IF ANY OF THEM HAD A CROWD ONE TENTH OF THE SIZE, THEY GO AROUND TALKING ABOUT HOW BIG THE CROWD IS. TAKE YOUR CAMERAS AND SPIN THAT SPIN THEM AROUND THIS BIG ARENA. THEY DON'T TURN HIM THEY DON'T TURN THEM. YOU NOTICE THEY DON'T TURN. THEM BUT IF THERE WAS TROUBLE IN THE CORNER, ANYTHING TO MAKE US LOOK BAD, THAT CAMERA WOULD TURN LIKE A PRETZEL. I USED TO THINK MODERN EQUIPMENT CAN'T TURN, BUT WE WOULD HAVE A PROTESTER AND I MUST SAY I'LL SAY IT OUT LOUD, WE DON'T HAVE TOO MANY PROTESTERS ANYMORE DO WE? WE DON'T HAVE TOO MANY. NO FUN TO BE A PROTESTER AT A TRUMP RALLY. BUT DO WE HAVE A GREAT TIME AT A TRUMP RALLY? MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO TAKEN THE MOST AGGRESSIVE ACTION IN MODERN HISTORY. TO PROTECT AMERICANS FROM THE CORONA VIRUS. YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING. IT'S HORRIBLE. INCLUDING SWEEPING TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS. TODAY WE MET WITH THE BIG GREAT PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, AND THEY ARE REALLY WORKING HARD AND WORKING SMART, AND WE HAD A GREAT MEETING TODAY WITH A LOT OF THE GREAT COMPANIES THEY HAVE THEY WILL HAVE VACCINES RELATIVELY SOON. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU BETTER AND THAT WILL ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE EVEN SOONER, SO A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. BUT WE HAVE STRONG BORDERS AND REALLY OUR TOUGH AND EARLY ACTIONS HAVE REALLY BEEN PROVEN TO BE 100% RIGHT. WE WENT OUT. WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING TO KEEP IN OUR POWER TO KEEP THE SICK AND INFECTED PEOPLE FROM COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD. WE CLOSED OUR BORDERS VERY EARLY. I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT FOR THAT. REMEMBER WHEN I CLOSED THE BORDERS TO CERTAIN AREAS OF THE WORLD? I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT, BUT THERE ARE GLOBALISTS WHO WOULD RATHER KEEP OUR BORDERS OPEN AND KEEP OUR INFECTIONS, THINK OF IT, THINK OF ALL THE INFECTIONS THAT WOULD COME IN. WE ARE WORKING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES AND ALTERNATE FAIRNESS. WE ARE WORKING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. REMEMBER THIS. OVER THE LAST LONG PERIOD OF TIME, THE FLU, FROM 27,000 TO 70,000 PEOPLE GET INFECTED, AND MANY PEOPLE DIE. THINK OF IT. 27,000. YOU LOSE 27,000 PEOPLE TO THE COMMON FLU. IT CAN BE MUCH MORE. WHEN YEAR WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE 70,000 NUMBER. THOSE PEOPLE DIE. SO WHEN YOU LOSE 27,000 PEOPLE A YEAR, NOBODY KNEW THAT. I DID NOT KNOW. THAT THREE FOUR WEEKS AGO I WAS SITTING DOWN I SAID WHEN WE LOSE WITH THE REGULAR FLU? THEY SAID 20,000 MINIMUM AND GOES UP TO 70 SOMETIMES EVEN 80. WHEN YEAR IT WENT UP TO 100,000 PEOPLE. I SAID NOBODY TOLD ME THAT NOBODY KNOWS THAT. SO I TOLD THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES YOU HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB WITH THAT VACCINE. REALLY. YOU HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB ON THAT VACCINE. LAST YEAR WAS APPROXIMATELY 36,000 PEOPLE DIED. WE ARE WORKING HARD ON IT AND WE ARE GOING TO COME UP WITH SOME REALLY GREAT SOLUTIONS. IN THE MEANTIME, WE ARE STOPPING. ONLY IN NORTH CAROLINA. ONLY IN NORTH CAROLINA. HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE ARE FROM SOUTH CAROLINA BY THE WAY? ... WILL WE HAVE BOTH PLACES BUT THAT WAS FROM NORTH CAROLINA. BUT JUST TO FINISH UP. WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS, WE REALLY DONE A GREAT JOB WITH IT. WE ARE KEEPING OUR BORDER STRONG. MY JOB IS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF AMERICAN PATIENTS AND AMERICANS FIRST. AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE DOING. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO POLITICIZE THE CORONAVIRUS. DENIGRATING THE NOBLE WORK OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, BUT HONESTLY NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE. EVERYONE APPRECIATES THEM. THESE ARE THE GREATEST PROFESSIONALS IN THE WORLD AT WHAT THEY DO. WE ARE ACTUALLY HELPING A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE SOME VERY VERY BIG PROBLEMS. WE HAVE OUR PROFESSIONALS IN CONSTANT TOUCH. I AM IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH SOME OF THE LEADERS AND HELPING THEM OUT, BUT THE POLITICAL ATTACKS OF SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS REALLY MUST START. WE HAVE GOT TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS ONE TO SAFEGUARD OUR PEOPLE. WE WILL SAFEGUARD OUR PEOPLE. THE UNITED STATES. THE UNITED STATES IS, RIGHT NOW, RANKED BY FAR, NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD FOR PREPAREDNESS. EARLIER TODAY WHEN I MET WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, THINGS WERE DISCUSSED AND LEARNED. HONESTLY, THE MEDIA DID NOT KNOW, NOBODY KNEW, THEY HAD NEVER HEARD THIS BEFORE, AND WE LEARNED A LOT, AND MAYBE THAT HAD THE IMPACT OF THE STOCK MARKET. WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED? BUT WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING, THE DURATION OF THE VIRUS. WE DISCUSSED ALL OF THESE THINGS. WE WILL BRING THESE THERAPIES TO MARK IT AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE, AND I HAVE TO SAY, WITH A THRIVING ECONOMY, THE WAY IT IS, AND THE MOST ADVANCED HEALTH SYSTEM ON EARTH, AMERICA IS SO RESULTANT. WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE HAVE THE GREATEST PEOPLE ON EARTH. WE HAVE THE GREATEST HEALTH SYSTEM ON EARTH. WE HAVE THE GREATEST HEALTH SYSTEM ON EARTH. THE RENEWAL OF AMERICAN STRENGTH OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS MEANS OUR TIMES OF CHALLENGE. WE ARE THE BEST PREPARED TO RISE TO ANY OCCASION. NO COUNTRY IS BETTER EQUIPPED THAN AMERICA TO HANDLE NEW THREATS, AND KNOW PEOPLE ARE MORE SKILLED, TALENTED, TOUGH, OR DRIVEN, THEN AMERICANS. AND TOGETHER, WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT AMERICAN COMEBACK. THAT IS WHAT IT IS. LAST MONTH, WE ADDED 225,000 NEW JOBS IN JANUARY ALONE. THAT MAKES 7 MILLION JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION. WE HAVE DESTROYED THE ISIS TERRITORY AND WE KILL THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF ISIS AL-BAGHDADI HE IS DEAD. AND WE TOOK OUT THE WORLD QASSEM SOLEIMANI, ENDING HIS EVIL REIGN OF TERROR FOREVER. SOLEIMANI. WHILE THE EXTREME LEFT HAS BEEN WASTING AMERICA'S TIME WITH FILE HOAXES AND DELUSIONAL WITCH HUNTS, WE HAVE BEEN KILLING TERRORISTS, CREATING JOBS, RAISING WAGES, AND LIFTING UP AMERICAN CITIZENS OF EVERY RACE, RELIGION, COLOR, AND CREEK. TOMORROW, VOTERS IN STATES ACROSS THE NATION WILL HEAD TO THE POLLS FOR SUPER TUESDAY, NOT SUPER THURSDAY. OH HE SAID SUPER THURSDAY. YOU CAN'T DO THESE THINGS. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I SAID SUPER THURSDAY? IT WOULD BE OVER. I WOULD BE OVER. NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE AT CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN'T AS AN EXAMPLE NAME LIKE, SLEEPY JOE. HE IS CONSTANTLY NAMING THE WRONG STATES. IT'S GREAT TO BE IN THE STATE OF A HIGH OH. NO I'M SORRY YOU ARE IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA. NO NO. JOE. DID YOU EVER SEE HIM RUN IN WITH A SIGN, NO NO NORTH CAROLINA JOE. ONCE THAT HAPPENS YOU MIGHT AS WELL LEAVE THE STATES IT'S A DISASTER NO MATTER HOW GOOD IT LOOKS. WE'RE NORTH CAROLINA, IT'S GREAT TO BE IN IDAHO. NO YOU ARE IN IOWA. NOW, HE MAKES A LOT OF THOSE MISTAKES. IT'S A LITTLE SCARY. YOU HAVE TO PROTECT YOUR SECOND AMENDMENTS TO SEE GUNS. BUT DID YOU SEE SLEEPY JOE? DID YOU SEE SLEEPY JOE WHERE HE SAID, LAST YEAR 150 MILLION PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY GUNS AND OUR COUNTRY. 150 MILLION. THAT MEANS 50% OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S A BIG STORY MAN. COULD YOU IMAGINE TRUMP SAYING THAT? THESE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER LET ME LIVE. WE CAN'T MAKE A LITTLE MISTAKE RIGHT? WE CAN'T EVEN MAKE A LITTLE TINY TINY MISTAKE. IF WE MAKE A TINY MISTAKE IT'S HEADLINE NEWS. THEY SAY THINGS LIKE 150 MILLION PEOPLE KILLED, GUNS. THEY SAY SUPER THURSDAY. THEY SAY GEORGIA. HE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO WINNING GEORGIA TOMORROW. GEORGIA IS NOT IN SUPER TUESDAY. SO MANY MISTAKES. YOU CANNOT DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE NEGOTIATING WITH CHINA. YOU CANNOT DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE NEGOTIATING WITH THESE COUNTRIES, YOU CANNOT DO THAT. THOSE MISTAKES WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE. THEN YOU HAVE MANY MIKE. YOU SEE THIS GUY? MANY MIKE. HE'S BEING INTERVIEW TONIGHT ON FOX, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? FOX. THEY WANT TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT. THEY END UP INTERVIEWING MORE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH FOX. BUT THEY ARE INTERVIEWING THIS GUY THE NIGHT BEFORE. MANY MIKE IAEA WHAT A MESS HE IS. IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES THE WORST PERFORMANCE. . I WOULD GET DOWN REALLY LOW BUT I DON'T WANT TO COPY EVERYBODY. EVERYONE SAYS OH, DO THAT AGAIN WHERE YOU GET DOWN LOW, BUT IF I DO THAT AGAIN, IT IS A COPY. IT IS A COPY. . NO. NO. NO. HE NEVER LIKED A COPY. EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE COPYING YOURSELF YOU DON'T LIKE TO COPY. YOU DO IT ONCE. IT WAS A BIG HIT, BUT YOU DO IT ONCE AND YOU SAY THAT WAS NICE, DON'T DO IT AGAIN. IF IT DOESN'T WORK THE SECOND TIME IT GETS EMBARRASSING RIGHT? WE ALL KNOW. BUT NOW HE IS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. HE IS A MESS. NO MATTER WHICH DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ANY ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES, AND YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT? THEY ARE ALL NOW, IT'S BEING RIGGED AGAINST, IT'S SAD, IT IS BEING RIGGED AGAINST CRAZY BERNIE. CRAZY BERNIE IS GOING TO GO CRAZY. CRAZY. I THINK CRAZY BERNIE IS GOING TO BE MORE CRAZY WHEN THEY SEE WHAT THERE WHEN HE SEES WHAT THEY ARE DOING. I CALLED IT A LONG TIME AGO. MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG. MAYOR PETE, HE QUIT OUT LAST NIGHT, AND THEN I HEAR, THEN I HEAR SENATOR FORMER STATE SAY WE'RE GONNA WIN WE'RE GOING TO WIN THAT STATE BUT SHE TRUMPED UP. SOUNDS LIKE THEY MADE A DEAL. THEY BOTH SUPPORTED SLEEPY JOE AND YOU KNOW WHY? THEY MADE A DEAL. YOU KNOW WHY? QUID PRO CROW, THAT IS WHY. QUID PRO QUO. QUID PRO QUO, THEY MADE A DEAL. IMPEACH THEM, THEY SHOULD BE IMPEACHED. THEY SHOULD BE IMPEACHED. QUID PRO CROW. BUT THEY HAVE EMBRACE AN EXTREME LEFT WING AGENDA. THEY PLAN THEIR PLANS WOULD MASSIVELY RAISE YOUR TAXES MUZZLE FAITH AND ERASE OUR SOVEREIGNTY. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS GONE CRAZY. WHETHER IT'S BERNIE SANDERS'S PLAN, TO ILLUMINATE PRIVATE HEALTH CARE. ELIZABETH POCAHONTAS IS, BY THE WAY SHE'S HISTORY. SHE IS HISTORY. I CAME UP WITH THAT NAME FAR TOO EARLY, I SHOULD HAVE JUST WAITED. IT DIDN'T MATTER, I THOUGHT SHE WAS MAKING A COMEBACK. I SAID I JUST DID IT TO HER. BUT YOU KNOW THOSE EMBERS WERE BURNING A LITTLE BIT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. AND FACTUAL PROBABLY LOSE THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS TO BERNIE. SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LOSE THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. SHE IS THE SENATOR FOR MASSACHUSETTS. I THINK SHE WILL LOSE IT TO BERNIE. AND THIS MICHIGAN, YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON OVER THERE? MICHIGAN WERE LEADING AND WISCONSIN, WE ARE LEADING IN FLORIDA, WE ARE LEADING IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WE ARE LEADING IN NORTH CAROLINA. WE ARE LEADING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE ARE LEADING IN THE GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST STATES OUR LAST ELECTION, HEY HOW GREAT WAS THE 2016 ELECTION? RIGHT? ONE OF THE GREATEST NIGHTS, ONE OF THE MOST HIGHEST RATED TELEVISION NIGHTS AND THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION, AND REMEMBER THEY WERE LIKE OH THIS IS GOING TO BE A QUICK ONE THAT WAS AND SO EASY FOR THEM. OH I LOVE THE SCENE. THE SCENE OF THEIR CONVENTION CENTER, WHERE HILLARY WAS GETTING READY TO SPEAK AND THEN SHE FOUND OUT SHE LOST. BUT ELIZABETH WARREN SHE HAD A PLAN TO ELIMINATE OUR BORDERS. OR MANY MICS PLAN TO ELIMINATE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. MIKE BLOOMBERG WANTS TO ELIMINATE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT IT WON'T HAPPEN. IT WON'T HAPPEN FOR HIM. FOR SLEEPY JOE, HE DOES NOT EVEN KNOW WHERE HE IS OR WHAT HE IS DOING. OR WET OFFICE HE IS RUNNING FOR. ACTUALLY, I HONESTLY DON'T THINK WHAT OFFICE I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT OFFICE HE'S RUNNING FOR. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER, MAYBE HE GETS AND BECAUSE HE IS A LITTLE MORE MODERATE, MAYBE HE GETS IT, BUT HE WON'T BE RUNNING IT OTHER PEOPLE WILL. THEY WILL PUT HIM INTO A HOME AND OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY, AND THEY WILL BE SUPER LEFT RADICAL CRAZY'S. THEY WILL BE SUPER LEFT RADICAL CRAZY'S ANGELA WILL BE IN A HOME WATCHING TELEVISION. EVERYTHING WILL BE JUST FINE. THE INSANITY OF WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS IS WHY MILLIONS OF REGISTERED DEMOCRAT VOTERS ARE JOINING OUR MOVEMENT. THEY OUR JOINING OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY. TURN THOSE TELEVISIONS WE HAD THIS ENTHUSIASM IN OUR PARTY. I CONSTANTLY HEAR ABOUT THE ENTHUSIASM. THEY ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER, THEY ARE HATING EACH OTHER THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. WE HAVE ALL THE 11TH UZI OUT SOME AND WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. SO WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED TONIGHT BY MANY REALLY GREAT TERRIFIC BRILLIANT WONDERFUL WARRIORS. EVEN THOUGH IT COMES FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STATE BUT NOT TOO FAR BY, IS SOMEBODY THAT HAS REALLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AND BECOME A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE. WHAT HE DID FOR JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? ONE OF THE GREATEST STATEMENTS EVER MADE IN THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM COME ON UP. LINDSEY GRAHAM, COME ON UP. COME HERE LINDSAY. I GOTTA HAVE HIM SAY SOMETHING. HELLO CHARLOTTE. IT'S GOOD TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE I DON'T HAVE AN ACCESS. MISTER PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR BEING THE BEST COMMANDER IN CHIEF SINCE RONALD REAGAN. THANK YOU FOR KILLING THE TERRORISTS OVER THERE SO THEY CANNOT HURT US OVER HERE. THANK YOU FOR STICKING WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH. MISTER PRESIDENT, EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM HAS ONE THING IN COMMON. WE ALL HAVE YOUR BACK. MISTER PRESIDENT, YOU ARE GOING TO KICK THEIR BUTTS IN NOVEMBER. GREAT GUY. GREAT GENTLEMAN. NOW SOME WARRIORS THAT REALLY DEFENDED US WITH THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX, ONE OF THE GREATEST HOAX IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. REPRESENTATIVE, VIRGINIA FOX. PATRICK MCHENRY, RICHARD HUDSON, MARK MEADOWS DAVID ROWS OR. TED BUN. THEY ARE WARRIORS. THESE GUYS ARE UNBELIEVABLE, THE WAY THEY FIGHT. I CAME HERE, AND THEY PROBABLY WEREN'T SCHEDULED TO WIN. AND FAKE NEWS CNN WORLD SAID, THEY WANTED A COUPLE OF LOSSES. , AND THEY HANDLE PRESSURE SO WELL. WE GAVE A RALLY THAT WAS LIKE THIS AND THEY CAME. AND THEN BISHOP AND GREG MURPHY WON BY SO MUCH IT WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE. AND THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE AND THEY HAVE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB THANK YOU SO MUCH. THEY HANDLE PRESSURE. THEY WERE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE AND THEY HANDLED IT WELL. IT IS NICE TO KNOW PEOPLE CAN HANDLE PRESSURE, THERE ARE NOT TOO MANY OF. THEM NORTH CAROLINA, REPUBLICAN PARTY CHAIRMAN MICHAEL WIDELY. THANK YOU MICHAEL. AND A FEW GREAT FRIENDS OF MINE. THEY LOVE CAROLINA LEWIS TO JOY WHO YOU KNOW, LEWIS JOY. TWO GREAT PEOPLE, DIAMOND AND SILK RIGHT? WHERE ARE THEY? WE LOVE THEM.

NOW WHILE THE MEDIA CONTINUE TO PLAY THE RACE CARD, WE WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY THE TRUMP CARD SO WE CAN WIN, WIN, AND WIN. YOU KNOW THE FIRST LADY, A LONG TIME AGO NOW? HOW LONG IS THAT PROBABLY ALMOST FIVE YEARS AGO. SHE SAID THESE TWO WOMEN ON THE INTERNET. THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLE. I SAID OH I KNOW I HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME. I HEAR IT ALL THE TIME. SHE SAID NO. THE NEXT DAY SHE SAID YOU KNOW, I SAW THE MCGAHN THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLE. I SAID LET ME SEE. I SAW THEM, I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM, AND EVERYONE FELL IN LOVE WITH DIAMONDS AND SILK. SO THANK YOU. SOME PEOPLE THAT HAVE REALLY BEEN HELPFUL TO ME, TORY LEWANDOWSKI, DAVID BOSSY, AND PAM BONDI, GREAT PEOPLE. AND THANKS ALSO TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING TO MAKE THE 2020 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION RIGHT HERE IN CHARLOTTE, AN OUTSTANDING SUCCESS. OUR CHAIRMAN RONNA MCDANIEL, RNC COCHAIRMAN TOMMY HICKS, AND CONGRESSIONAL PRESIDENT MARTIALLY KELLY. THANK YOU EVERYBODY. THEY ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. THEY HAVE GOT TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY AND DOING A GREAT JOB. DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB EARN A CATCH OF AS LONG AS YOU WIN. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID WHEN WE WON LAST TIME? SOMEBODY ELSE TOOK THE CONVENTION CENTER AND SPENT A FORTUNE. I JUST TOOK A HOTEL BALLROOM AND SAID WITH THE HECK, IF I WIN NOBODY CARES, AND IF I DON'T, LOOK IF YOU WIN NOBODY CARES WHAT ROOM YOU ARE IN. IF YOU LOSE, NOBODY CARES WHAT ROOM YOU ERIN WRAY? SO WE TOOK A BALLROOM, A NICE BALLROOM NO BIG DEAL. I FIGURED, THIS WAY IF WE WIN, NOBODY CARES, AND IF WE LOSE, I AM OUT OF THERE AND I SAVE A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY. BUT I NEVER THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO LOSE, TRUMP FELT THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO WIN. SURE I'M RUNNING BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO LOSE. THAT IS NOT THE DEAL. IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE IF YOU DON'T WIN, BUT BOY I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO WIN AND WE WERE GETTING CROWDS LIKE. THIS ACTUALLY, TO BE HONEST, I THINK OUR CROWDS NOW ARE BIGGER, STRONGER, AND EVEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC. I REALLY THINK THEY ARE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC THAN EVER BEFORE. WE ARE EIGHT MONTHS AWAY, THAT IS A LONG TIME. IT'S NOT EVEN AND, CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD WE'VE GUIDED MADE IN THE PRIMARIES. I THINK WE HAVE GOT IT MADE. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE FOR US WE'RE NOT EVEN INTO POLITICAL SEASON AND WE ARE GETTING CROWDS LIKE THIS. WE WERE ALL OVER OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. WE LIKE TO TROLL, WE LIKE TO GO THE NIGHT BEFORE ONE OF THEIR PRIMARIES, AND WE DO A LITTLE TROLLING. IT'S CALLED WE DO A LITTLE TROLLING. BERNIE SANDERS WAS VERY UPSET. WHY WOULD HE BE THERE? WHY? BECAUSE I WANT TO WIN. THAT'S A GOOD REASON. BUT HONESTLY, WHAT YOU SEE WHEN YOUR TWO MONTHS OR THREE MONTHS OUT, WE ARE GETTING NUMBERS THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLE. COLORADO, WE WENT TO IOWA, EVERY PLACE WE'VE GONE, YOU HAMPSHIRE, EVERY PLACE WE'VE GONE JUST CAME OUT OF SOUTH CAROLINA, SO THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE ONE. EVERY PLACE, EVERY PLACE THAT WE HAVE GONE IT HAS BEEN AMAZING. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO RECOGNIZE A WOMAN WHO HAS REALLY HELPED US WHEN NORTH CAROLINA AND 2016, I HAVE A FEELING THIS YEAR SHE WILL DO EVEN BETTER BECAUSE SHE HAPPENED TO GROW UP HERE. LAURA TRUMP. AND MY SON, ERIC TRUMP. TWO GREAT PEOPLE. I HAVE TO SAY THAT ABOUT MY SON, I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THEIR SONS THAT MUCH. BUT LAURA HAS BEEN FANTASTIC SHE KNOWS THE STATE BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM EXCEPT MAYBE THAT GUY RIGHT THERE. HOW ARE WE DOING LAURA? HOW ARE WE DOING? HOW ARE WE DOING IN THE STATE, ARE WE DOING WELL? AND WE ARE DOING WELL IN PENNSYLVANIA HERE, RIGHT? AND SOUTH CAROLINA, I KNOW WE ARE DOING GREAT THERE. ALSO WITH US TONIGHT, IT IS A MAN WHO HAS REALLY BECOME A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. WE WERE GOING AT IT A LITTLE BIT AT THE BEGINNING, BUT I WILL TELL YOU, AND I WOULD SAY IF I DID NOT GET ALONG I WOULD NOT BE HERE I WOULDN'T DO THIS. HE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS SUPPORTER, AND THINGS THAT WE'VE WANTED TO DO, AND FIGHTS THAT WE'VE HAD WHICH WERE SO IMPORTANT, HE HAS BEEN RIGHT UP AND LINDSAY WILL TELL YOU HE HAS BEEN RIGHT UP IN FRONT. HE DESERVES ANOTHER SIX YEAR TERM, AND PROBABLY A LOT LONGER THAN THAT. BUT HE WILL COME UP AND I'M GOING TO ASK SENATOR TOM CALLOUS TO COME UP. TOM HAS REALLY BEEN INCREDIBLE HE HAS BEEN WORKING EVERY DAY. HE REALLY WANTS TO FIGHT THE RADICAL LEFT AND HE KNOWS HOW TO HOW TO FIGHT. TAKE CARE OF OUR AMAZING VETERANS, STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. TOM IS A CHAMPION. FOR THE PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA, THIS NOVEMBER WE NEED EVERYBODY TO GO AND VOTE FOR TOM, HE IS DOING GREAT. HE IS DOING GREAT. I HEAR HE IS WAY UP IN THE POLLS. HE IS WAY UP IN THE POLLS. TOM'S A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU ALL AGAIN FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING OUR PRESIDENT. MAKE SURE THAT I COME BACK FOR ANOTHER SIX YEARS AND WE CAN COME BACK FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT. I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT, SINCE BEFORE THIS PRESIDENT WAS EVER SWORN IN SWORN IN THEY TRITON IMPEACHED AND VIDEO OR BACK DOWN? NO. WHEN THE MEDIA GOES OUT AND SPREAD FALSE NEWS OR FAKE NEWS, DOES HE BACKED DOWN? . NO WHEN HE MAKES A PROMISE DOES HE KEEP IT? WHEN HE TOLD YOU WE WOULD CUT TAXES DID HE DO IT? WHEN HE TOLD YOU HE WOULD SUPPORT VETERANS THAT HE DO IT? WHEN HE TOLD YOU THAT WE WOULD REFUND THE MILITARY AND BECOME THE WORLD SUPERPOWER DID HE DO IT? WHEN HE TOLD YOU THAT HE WAS GOING TO CONFIRM SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AND DISTRICT COURT JUSTICES DID HE DO IT? YEAH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU HAVE GOT TO START CHOICE IT STARTS TOMORROW WE ARE BOTH ON THE BALLOT YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR US SO WE CAN DO IT AGAIN. LET ME TELL YOU AGAIN, WE CANNOT FORGET WHAT THEY ARE PROMISING YOU ON THE OTHER. SITE BERNIE SANDERS IS SO LIBERAL HE DOES NOT EVEN CALL HIMSELF A DEMOCRAT. HE CALLS HIMSELF A SOCIALIST. THIS PRESIDENT WENT TO THE STATE OF THE UNION AND HE SAID AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. THAT IS ANOTHER PROMISE HE HAS GOT TO KEEP. NOW FINALLY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT FOR COMING BACK AND I CAN'T WAIT TO LOOK AT HIM IN AUGUST FOR THE RNC CONVENTION. MISTER PRESIDENT, IT WAS ONE THING THAT YOU SAID BACK IN THE CAMPAIGN OF 2016. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S HAPPENED. HAVE YOU GOTTEN TIRED OF WINNING? . DO YOU WANT TO WIN SOME MORE? THEN YOU HAVE THIS TO GET THIS MAN RE-ELECTED SO THAT WE CAN GET WITH THIS COUNTRY DESERVES. FREE BARGAINS, BREACH RAINS FREE, TRAITS FREEDOM OF RELIGION, FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM FOR YOU TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOUR RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS. THAT IS THE FREEDOM THAT THIS MAN REPRESENTS. THAT IS THE FREEDOM I REPRESENT GET HIM ELECTED FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. WOW. WOW. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD TIME. A LOT OF TIMES WE GET PEOPLE UP AND THEY JUST CANNOT DO IT. . THEY START BREATHING THAT, THEY CANNOT BREATHE, HELP ME. LIKE BLOOMBERG. HE GOES ALL. DID YOU SEE THE DEBATE? OH. SHE CAME AFTER HIM SHE'S BEEN SHE'S VERY MEAN. SHE CAME AFTER HIM AND HE STARTED CHOKING. OH OH GET ME OFF THE STAGE YOU GUYS DID NOT TELL ME THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. NO THAT WAS GREAT TOM. WE'RE ALSO HONOR TO BE JOINED TOGETHER BY A TRUE AMERICAN HERO, A VETERAN OF WORLD WAR II, AND THE KOREAN WAR WHO JUST TURNED 100 YEARS OLD. HIS NAME IS GEORGE WASHINGTON PARROT. GEORGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU GEORGE. 100 YEARS OLD. HE'S 100 AND HE LOOKS GOOD THANK YOU GEORGE. WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE HERE TONIGHT, AMERICA HAS NOW BECOME THE HOTTEST ECONOMY ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET EARTH. SINCE MY ELECTION, OVER 219,000 NEW JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED RIGHT HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA. WE HAVE LIFTED 10 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF WELFARE, INCLUDING 7 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVEL EVER EVER RECORDED. THINK OF THAT. THE AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FROM MY ADMINISTRATION IS THE LOWEST FOR ANY U.S. PRESIDENT IN RECORDED HISTORY. THAT IS THAT BIG. IT IS THAT BIG. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS HISPANIC AMERICANS, ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN RECORDED HISTORY. VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. AFRICAN AMERICAN, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED AN ALL-TIME LOW. AFRICAN AMERICAN POVERTY IS AT THE LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED. FOR DECADES, DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS BETRAYED AND THEY TRULY DID. THEY BETRAYED AFRICAN AMERICANS. MY ADMINISTRATION IS DELIVERING FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS, LIKE NEVER BEFORE. NO PRESIDENT HAS DONE MORE FOR OUR BLACK COMMUNITY. NO PRESIDENT HAS DONE MORE FOR OUR BLACK COMMUNITY, AND IT IS AN HONOR TO DO IT. LAST MONTH HERE IN CHARLOTTE, WE LAUNCHED A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN TO CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL AMERICANS. IT IS CALLED OPPORTUNITY NOW. YOU KNOW ABOUT IT. WE ARE ALSO FIGHTING TO ENSURE THAT WORKING FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE, REDUCING THE COST OF CHILDCARE AND GIVING 40 MILLION AMERICAN FAMILIES AN AVERAGE OF 2200 DOLLARS THANKS TO THE REPUBLICAN CHILD TAX CREDIT. THE REPUBLICANS ARE CLAIMING THAT WE DID THAT. NOBODY ELSE DID THAT. BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING HOW DID THEY DO THAT ONE? WE ARE REVERSING DECADES OF CALAMITOUS TRADE POLICIES THAT THE SUN MADE IT MANUFACTURING IN NORTH CAROLINA. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT. IT IS PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE REASON I'M RUNNING. THE DEALS WE ARE MAKING, THE TRADE DEALS WHO ARE MAKING ARE UNBELIEVABLE. YOUR STATE LOST 43% OF ALL MANUFACTURING SHOPS, AFTER NAFTA WAS SIGNED. THINK ABOUT THAT. WEEKS AGO, WE FINALLY ENDED THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE AND I SIGNED THE BRAND NEW U.S. MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT IN THE WORLD. THE USMCA IS A GIANT VICTORY FOR NORTH CAROLINA. AND CREDIBLE FOR FARMERS AND FACTORY WORKERS. BY THE WAY SPEAKING OF FARMERS AND FACTORY WARNER'S FACTORY WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, FOR THE DEATH TAX. YOU KNOW THE INHERITANCE TAX? YOU HAVE A SMALL FARM SOMEPLACE YOU HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS, YOU HAVE A NICE BUSINESS. YOU KNOW LONGER HAVE AN INHERITANCE TAX OR A DEATH TAX SO IF YOU WANT IT TO YOU OR LEAVE IT TO YOUR CHILDREN YOU CAN LEAVE IT TO YOUR CHILDREN. THERE IS NO TAX TO BE PAID BY YOUR CHILDREN. SO THEY DO NOT HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE EVIL BANK AND MORE MONEY FROM THE BANKER, LOSE THE FARM, LOSE THE BUSINESS. IT WON'T HAPPEN. AND I ALWAYS SAY, I KNOW A LOT OF PARENTS, THEY DON'T LOVE THEIR CHILDREN VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM THAT DOES NOT LOVE YOUR CHILDREN? PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. NOBODY. NOBODY, THAT IS BECAUSE WE ARE NORTH CAROLINA. YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN. BUT IF YOU DON'T, THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR CHILDREN DON'T LEAVE THEM A THING OK? BUT YOU DON'T YOU DO NOT HAVE THE INHERITANCE TAX ANYMORE WHICH IS GREAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT BUT IT IS A BIG DEAL. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS MORE THOROUGHLY BETRAYED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEN ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION. EVERY DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR DEMOCRATS SUPPORTS FREE FEDERAL WELFARE FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS ON YOUR TAXES. NOT ONLY DOES ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION DURING OUR TREASURY, BUT IT THREATENS INNOCENT LIVES, AS A JUST ONE HEARTBREAKING EXAMPLE, TWO ILLEGAL ALIENS IN MARYLAND THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER WAS RELEASED UNACCOUNTABLE RELEASED AND WENT ON TO MURDER A TEENAGE GIRL, BEATING HER WITH A BASEBALL BAT AND SLASHING HER WITH A MACHETE. THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC FIELD SUPPORTS DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES, WHICH RELEASE DANGEROUS CRIMINALS TO TERRORIZE YOUR COMMUNITIES, RIGHT HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA, BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE SANCTUARY COUNTY OF DURHAM RELEASED AN ILLEGAL ALIEN CRIMINAL, WHO THEN PROCEEDED TO VICIOUSLY MURDER A YOUNG 19-YEAR-OLD WOMAN LAST YEAR, YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT, KILLING HER AND DUMPING HER BODY INTO THE WOODS. LAST YEAR ALONE, SANCTUARY JURISDICTIONS IN NORTH CAROLINA, HOW DID THAT HAPPEN TO NORTH CAROLINA? DELIBERATELY SET FREE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS, AND THESE ARE REALLY DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS INCLUDING THOSE CHARGED OR CONVICTED OF BURGLARY, GUN CRIMES, SEXUAL ASSAULT, KIDNAPPING AND EVEN MURDER GOT TO CHANGE THIS. AND WILL BAN SANCTUARY CITIES IN YOUR STATE, WHAT IS HE THINKING? BUT WHILE YOU ARE SUPER LEVEL GOVERNOR IS PUTTING YOUR FAMILIES AT RISK, YOUR REPUBLICAN SENATOR TOM TILLIS HAS INTRODUCED A BILL ALLOWING AMERICAN VICTIMS TO SUE SANCTUARY CITIES FOR THE HORRIBLE PAIN, ANGUISH, AND SUFFERING THAT INFLICT ON OUR PEOPLE WE'RE BUILDING THE WALL, WE'RE BUILDING THE BALL, WE'RE BUILDING THE BALL, WE'RE BUILDING THE WALL! MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL, BY THE WAY. . WE BUILT 127 MILES AS OF TODAY, 127 MILES. AND MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL. THE MEDIA IS GOING TO BE THRILLED WHEN I EXPLAIN. BECAUSE FINALLY THEY SAY I'VE HAD OBSTRUCTION LIKE YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT, THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. I CAN GET ANYTHING, I CREATED SPACE FORCE, I CAN DO ANYTHING. BUT LINDSAY AND TOM TILLIS KNOW THIS, MARK KNOWS, THIS ALL OF THEM KNOW THIS, IF I WANT TO TEN CENTS FOR THE WALL THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT, BUT NOW WE HAVE IT AND YOU THINK THAT IS EASY? NOBODY SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS, WE ARE BUILDING OUR HEARTS AWAY, WE WILL SOON BE BUILDING MANY MILES A WEEK, BUT WE'RE UP TO OVER 125, 127 MILES OF THE SUPER WALL. I WANT TO BORDER PATROL AND SAID WHAT IS YOUR WISH, WELL IT'S LIKELY TO BE STEEL AND CONCRETE. THEY WANTED EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE, AND THE BARRIERS UP TOP ONE EVERYTHING, IT'S CALLED A NO CLIMB PROVIDER, NO CLIMB PROVIDES, OR I SAID WHAT IS THE WORD PROVIDES OR MAINE AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. I MEAN YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO CLIMB OVER, IT'S VERY TOUGH. AND A PART OF THE WALL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THEY WERE PLANNING A WALL AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS TO TAKE THEM, DOWN THAT IS WHAT THE NO CLIMB IS. THAT'S A NO CRIME, AND WHAT A VOICE. WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL, IT'S GOING GREAT, SO THEY SAID HE'S BUILDING THE WALL, BUT MEXICO'S NOT PAYING FOR IT. YOU WILL SEE. YOU WILL SEE. SOME OF YOU UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I TOLD A FEW PEOPLE LAST WEEK AND IT WAS LEAKED TO THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA, IF YOU WANT TO AND SANCTUARY CITIES IN NORTH CAROLINA, THEN YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE, YOU MUST VOTE REPUBLICAN. YOU HAVE TO. YOU HAVE TO. THINGS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE BORDER, WE HAVE REDUCED ILLEGAL BOARDING CROSSINGS BY A STAGGERING 75%. WE HAVE ENDED CATCH AND RELEASE, ONE OF THE WORST LOOPHOLES YOU EVER WILL SEE, CATCH AND RELEASE, YOU CATCH AND YOU SAY WHERE DO YOU LIVE? THEY DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, THEY DON'T KNOW, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT,. AND MEXICO, MAYBE HONDURAS, GUATEMALA, WHO KNOWS, EL SALVADOR WHERE, DO YOU LIVE? THIS GUY IS A MEXICAN, YOU ARE ABOUT AS MEXICAN AS I AM. LOOK AT THIS GUY, HE'S AS MEXICAN AS I AM, LOOK AT THAT HAT. ARE YOU MEXICAN? ARE YOU MEXICAN? NO, YOU ARE NOT. ARE YOU? HE IS. IT'S LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN, SHE SAID SHE WAS AN INDIAN, I SAID RIGHT. I SAID I HAVE MORE INDIAN BLOOD IN ME THEN YOU HAVE AND I HAVE NOT, AND SHE SAID THIS IS TERRIBLE, THAT SHE WENT OUT AND GOT A TEST, AND IT TURNED OUT NOT SO GOOD FOR HER. 1024TH. 1000TH. SO I THOUGHT I HAVE MORE AND ME. WHAT A PHONY SHE IS. WHAT A PHONY. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME, 100 CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR BERNIE SANDERS HEALTH CARE TAKEOVER AND THE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS TRY TO DESTROY YOUR HEALTH CARE AND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, AND THEY ARE GOING TO DESTROY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. REMEMBER THEY USED TO SAY WITH ME, I'M GOING TO END THE FIRST TIME, AND ALL OF THAT HAS MADE IT STRONGER, YOU KNOW THAT. MY ADMINISTRATION IS PROTECTING YOU, SOCIAL SECURITY, YOUR MEDICARE FAN DECIDING TO GIVE YOU GREAT HEALTH CARE, WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE GREAT HEALTH CARE. WE ARE DEFENDING YOUR RIGHT TO KEEP THE DOCTOR AND A PLAN OF YOUR CHOICE. REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA? YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR AND YOUR PLAN. 28 TIMES THEY SAID IMPEACH HIM, YOU SHOULD IMPEACH HIM, WE SHOULD IMPEACH HIM. 20 TIMES HE SAID THAT YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PLAN, WELL IT'S NOT TRUE. THERE WASN'T. IMPEACH HIM. WE ARE MAKING HEALTH CARE BETTER AND MUCH CHEAPER PREMIUMS DOUBLED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE. WE ARE NOW UP TO 60% LESS EXPENSIVE AND THEY ARE BETTER PLANS. WE ARE PROTECTING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND WE ALWAYS WELL. WE ARE TRYING TO TERMINATE THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE WORSE HEALTH CARE IN THE WORLD AND WE ARE TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE BEST HEALTH CARE YOU'VE EVER SEEN AT A LOWER PRICE, AND OF COURSE, PROTECTING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. PROTECTING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE'RE FIGHTING TO STOP SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? SURPRISE, YOU GET ALL SORTS OF SURPRISES. PEOPLE TAKE A BLOOD TEST AND IN ONE PLACE IS 26 DOLLARS, AND IN THE OTHER PLACE IT'S 2000 DOLLARS. SAME BLOOD TEST, MAYBE THE CHEAP ONE IS BETTER, WHO KNOWS. SAME BLOOD TESTS, IT'S WRONG. SURPRISE, MEDICAL BUILDING. I SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IMPOSING PRICE TRANSPARENCY, THAT IS GOING TO BE BIGGER THAN HEALTH CARE BECAUSE WHEN PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW THEIR PRICES, THOSE SAME PRICES FALL VERY FAST, IT'S A BIG THING. THAT'S A BIG THING. WE HAVE APPROVED A RECORD NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE DRUGS THAT ARE AS GOOD AS NAME BRAND DRUGS BUT A FRACTION OF THE COST. WE HAVE GIVEN THEM, AND THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL PRESSURE NOT TO DO THAT, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY. TO CARE FOR OUR AMAZING VETERANS, WE PASSED VA CHOICE AND VA ACCOUNTABILITY, AND NOBODY SAID IT COULD BE DONE. SO INSTEAD OF WAITING ONLINE FOR DAYS AND DAYS AND WEEKS AND WEEKS TO SEE A DOCTOR, YOU GO OUTSIDE, YOU GET A DOCTOR, YOU GET ALL FIXED UP, WHAT A GREAT THING. IT'S CALLED ME A CHOICE. HE'S BEEN TRYING TO PASS IT FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE. AND THOSE PEOPLE WERE A GREAT HELP, WE HAVE PASSED A SPECTACULAR RIGHT TO TRY, YOU KNOW THAT IS? HOPEFULLY NOBODY NEEDS IT. HOPEFULLY NOBODY IN THE ROOM NEEDS WHITE TO TRY, WE ARE COMBATTING THE OPIOID ACADEMIC, DECLINING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY 31 YEARS. BIG PROBLEM. AND WE HAVE LAUNCHED NEW INITIATIVES COMBATTING GETTING DISEASE AND ALZHEIMER'S. AND WE ARE PURSUING NEW ADVANCES IN NEONATAL RESEARCH TO CARE FOR AMERICA'S YOUNGEST PATIENCE, AND BREAKING ALL RECORDS IN SO DOING. FORTUNATELY EVERY DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE HAS DECLARED THEIR UNLIMITED SUPPORT FOR LATE TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABY STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB, RIGHT UP UNTIL THE VERY MOMENT OF BIRTH. HOW ABOUT THAT? THAT IS WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT LATE TERM ABORTIONS UP A PIECE BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT OF GOD. THEN YOU HAVE THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, THE BABY IS BORN THE BABY IS BORN YOUTH ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MOTHER ABOUT IF YOU EXECUTE THE BABY, THIS IS THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, HE IS A BEAUTY, REMEMBER WHAT HE DID? HE WANTED TO DANCE LIKE MICHAEL JACKSON AND HIS WIFE STOPPED HIM, HE GOT LUCKY. BUT THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA WANTED TO DO THE BABY IS BORN AND THEN HE GOES OVER AND TALKS TO THE MOTHER AND YOU MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE BABY LIVE. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THAT? THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS THE PARTY OF LATE TERM ABORTIONS, OPEN BORDERS, SOCIALISM, BLATANT CORRUPTION AND THE OBLITERATION OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN. SO MANY PEOPLE CAME UP TO ME TODAY, AND THEY WANT ME TO FIGHT AND WE ARE DOING IT FOR SCHOOL CHOICE SO THAT EVERY CHILD WHO NEEDS IT GETS IT WITH NO PARENT EVER FORCING TO SEND THEIR CHILD TO A FAILING GOVERNMENT COOL. I PASS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, ALICE JOHNSON, AND THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL AND OPEN THE AMERICAN CAPITAL IN JERUSALEM. WE RECOGNIZE THE SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS, OUR HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES MILITARY, INCLUDE 200 MILLION DOLLARS TO A PLACE THAT NOBODY HAS HEARD OF IN THIS AUDIENCE, I'M SURE. FORT BRAGG. 300 MILLION DOLLARS FOR A MARINE CORPSb POINT. MORE THAN 500 MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN AIR STATION NEW RIVER, AND LISTEN TO THIS ONE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND MONEY, MORE THAN 1.2 BILLION DOLLARS FOR CAMP LESSON. AND I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS, WE HAVE TO HAVE A STRONG MILITARY, WE HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY WE'VE EVER HAD. OUR MILITARY AND 1.2 MILLION DOLLARS WENT INTO. WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE OUR POLITICIANS, AND YOU WANT A PRESIDENT STANDING UP FOR AMERICA, AND WE'RE STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA AND ALWAYS WELL. . AS TAKEN OUR PRESENT BATTLE WITH THE ACTUAL SURVIVAL OF OUR NATION ITSELF. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO INHERIT THAT BLESSINGS OF GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS WHO FOUGHT AND DIED TO SECURE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SECURING US, OUR FREEDOM, WE ARE DEVOTING EVERYTHING WE HAVE TOWARDS VICTORY IN NOVEMBER, NOVEMBER 3RD, TO BE EXACT. I WE HAVE TO DRAIN THE WASHINGTON SWAMP WHICH IS MUCH MORE VICIOUS AND DIRTIER AND DEEPER THAN I EVER THOUGHT BUT WE ARE KICKING. WITH YOUR HEALTH, WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK, DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE, AND POVERTY TO PROSPERITY, TOGETHER WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR, SAFE, SANE AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION. ROUND WE WILL REELECT COME TELL US. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SO ANGRY AT YOU, I ONLY COME BACK A FEW TIME OF THE YEAR. TOM IS GOING TO BE GREAT, I THINK THEY'RE A GREAT CHAMP. I THINK YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE. ONE MORE HAND FOR TOM TELL US, PLEASE. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO'S RUNNING. WE WANT TO ENACT NEW TRADE DEALS THAT RESULTED IN NEW PRODUCTS THAT ARE STAMPED WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, MADE IN THE USA. WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER, AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN LESS THAN NINE YEARS, WE'VE ALREADY STARTED. WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT. WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.",

         "Governor Ron DeSantis, First Lady Casey, Administrator Bridenstine, Director Cabana, General Selva, distinguished members of Congress, Marillyn Hewson, the dedicated men and women of NASA, and especially Rick Armstrong and the members of the Neil Armstrong family, and Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin: It is my great honor to be here with all of you today. It's great to be back here at the John F. Kennedy Space Center, as Vice President and as Chairman of the National Space Council, with my wonderful wife Karen, to celebrate - - to celebrate with all of you the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing a half a century ago that will be remembered forever. And I've been looking forward to this day, but allow me to bring greetings from another great space enthusiast and a great champion of American leadership in space. I begin today by bringing greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. Today, our nation pays tribute to the three brave astronauts who sat atop a 360-foot rocket that lifted off from Pad 39A 50 years ago this week - two of whom walked on the moon 50 years ago today. We also gather to pay tribute to the nearly 400,000 Americans - engineers, technicians, designers - whose sacrifices and dedication made it possible for Apollo 11 to complete what another president called 'the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure upon which mankind has ever embarked.' Let's hear it for all those who supported these three brave astronauts 50 years ago. When President Kennedy challenged the nation in 1961 to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the Earth before the decade was out, it's important to remember that our country was not yet ready to meet that challenge. We didn't have the rockets or the launch pads, or the spacesuits or the lander. We hadn't even invented many of the materials or tools that we would need. Not only did we not have what we needed, we didn't even know what we needed. But President Kennedy summarized that epic endeavor in one simple sentence: 'We choose to go to the moon.' The moon was a choice. An American choice. And like every time the American people make up their mind, once that decision was made, American ingenuity, grit, and determination - the achievement was inevitable. The only challenges that remained were challenges of engineering and science. The moon didn't come easily, and it didn't come without costs. And it did not come without grave danger or without sacrifice. To this day, Americans grieve the loss of three brave astronauts of Apollo 1 who were lost in a fire on the launchpad in January of 1967. And we think of them and their families even today. The risks for Apollo were so great, the odds were so long, that many feared that even if our astronauts made it to the moon, they might not make it back. In fact, history records that President Nixon prepared a speech in the event of a tragedy, where he would explain to the nation that the mission had failed. But, of course, the mission didn't fail. After all - with 400,000 men and women behind the mission at NASA, and with the hearts and prayers of the American people - how could it fail? For at the controls of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module, known as Eagle, stood two great Americans: Mission Commander Neil Armstrong and a man who is with us today, Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin. And circling overhead in lunar orbit was Command Module pilot Michael Collins. Fifty years ago today, at almost exactly this hour, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were about halfway into their powered descent on the final leg of their landing on the moon. There they were, standing beside one another in a capsule not much bigger than a couple of telephone booths, just minutes from touchdown. They thought they were ready for every contingency. After all, as Buzz told me just a few days ago, they had spent two years intensively training for this moment, and they'd run almost 600 simulated landings all designed to be more difficult than the real thing. Eagle had just finished its rollover to position itself for final approach, when all of the sudden, Neil Armstrong called out to Houston that Eagle had a '1202 Alarm.' The problem was nobody on board or in Houston had any idea what a '1202 Alarm' was. Eagle's flight computer was overloading. Not only could they not see the moon out their windows; they couldn't know for certain how far they were from the surface. Not a good way to fly. And yet, how calm they were. Working with the team back here on Earth, they quickly resolved the problem without betraying the slightest anxiety. People all over the world were watching, with no idea that anything had gone wrong. That, my friends, is what they used to call the 'Right Stuff'. You know, there's a reason Neil Armstrong, as well, was called the 'Ice Commander' in his day. When the original landing area turned out to be so full of large boulders that landing there would have doomed the mission and the crew, history records that Neil Armstrong calmly took control of the Lunar Module, skimmed along the top of the surface of the moon in search for a safe place to touch down. And by the time he found a safe spot, known to all of us as Tranquility Base, Armstrong and Aldrin had only 17 seconds of fuel remaining. Like every one of my generation, I remember that day. Six hundred million people around the world were watching their TVs and listening to their radios, waiting with admiration, anxiety, and wonder. And I was one of them - a little boy sitting in front of our black-and-white television in the basement of our home in Indiana. When those first snowy images of Neil Armstrong stepping off the bottom rung of the ladder beamed down to Earth at 10:56 p.m. on Sunday, July 20, 1969, they made an indelible mark - not just on my imagination, but on the imagination of my generation and every generation to come. It was a moment so rich in meaning that, upon hearing Neil Armstrong's first call from Tranquility Base, even the era's greatest newsman, Walter Cronkite, could only shake his head and utter two words: 'Oh, boy.' All at once, the nation held its breath - as through the crackling broadcast we listened to, we heard Neil Armstrong use those immortal words: 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' In that moment, the men of Apollo 11 did more than help expand our understanding of Creation, and they did more than win the Space Race. They brought together our nation. And for one brief moment, all the people of the world were truly one. Now, true to their creed, astronauts have never liked the idea of being called heroes. Yet for all they did - and for all the risks they took - if Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Mike Collins are not heroes, then there are no heroes. We honor these men today, and America will always honor our Apollo astronauts. They were heroes all. We honor the men of Apollo 11 by remembering their epic voyage and telling their story. But we also honor them by continuing the work they so nobly and courageously advanced in American space exploration. Apollo 11 was followed by five more successful moon missions culminating in the final historic journey of Apollo 17 - America's last trip to the moon. As we honor our Apollo 11 astronauts, we are also honored today to be joined by Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmidt. Thank you for your courageous service. As Harrison and I have discussed about his mission, while the last words spoken on the moon might not be as well-known as the first words, his fellow astronaut Gene Cernan said more perhaps than anyone could've known at the time. It was a challenge to our time. As he stepped off the moon on December 17, 1972, Gene - he said these words, and I quote, 'As I take man's last steps on the moon for some time to come, history will recordthat America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow.' And then he ended by saying, 'We leave the moon as we came and, God willingwe shall soon return with peace and hope for all mankind.' Those were words of challenge in 1972. And in our time, as President Trump said, this generation of Americans knows that it is 'America's destiny to bethe leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown.' And standing before you today, I am proud to report, at the direction of the President of the United States of America, America will return to the moon within the next five years, and the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts. We're going back. After more than 45 years, where one administration after another chose to limit America's space program to low Earth orbit, President Donald Trump has changed all that. Early in this administration, the President revived the National Space Council within the White House to coordinate all space-related activities across the government, including matters related to national security. And we've been hard at work. The Space Council has helped bring together skilled leaders in business and industry to revive and renew America's commitment to human space exploration. And I'm pleased that many members of our Users' Advisory Group for the Space Council are with us today for this historic occasion. Join me in welcoming these dedicated and distinguished Americans. The President also signed Space Policy Directive 1, 'challenging NASA to lead the return of Americans to the moon, send the first Americans to Mars, and enable humans to expand and deepen our reach across the solar system.' It is our mission. And as I speak to you today, I'm proud to report we're investing in new rockets, new spaceships. We're working with private companies around this country to develop the new technologies of the future by unleashing the burgeoning private space industry that dots the landscape of this historic center and this nation. And within the next year, we will once again send American astronauts into space on American rockets, from American soil. Already, we've given our human exploration missions a newfound sense of urgency not seen in more than a generation. And, last year, NASA and American innovators began an accelerated design process for both the lunar orbital gateway and the lunar surface base - all of which we will need to support Americans on the moon and to train and prepare to send Americans to Mars. And while we've made great strides in advancing the President's bold vision for space - unlike in years past, we will have the budgets to match it. And that's why I'm especially grateful today to be joined by some of the greatest champions of American leadership in space in the Congress of the United States: House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, Congressman Robert Aderholt, Congressman Brian Babin, Congressman Bill Posey, and other distinguished members of Congress. Would you please rise and allow us to express our appreciation for your strong support of renewed American leadership? With strong bipartisan support, this President has already signed into law the largest NASA budget ever. And on this historic occasion, I'm told that we've also achieved a critical milestone in our effort to go to the moon and beyond. Today, thanks to the hard work of the men of NASA - men and women of NASA and of American industry, the Orion crew vehicle for the Artemis 1 mission is complete and ready to begin preparations for its historic first flight. In the coming years, American astronauts will return to the moon aboard the Orion, and they'll return with new ambitions. We will spend weeks and months, not days and hours, on the lunar surface. This time we're going to the moon to stay - and to explore and develop new technologies. We will extract water from ice in the permanently shadowed craters of the South Pole. We will fly on a new generation of spacecraft that will enable us to reach Mars, not in years but in months. Americans are leading in space once again. And today we're reminded - we're reminded how American leadership 50 years ago, and the accomplishment of Apollo 11, inspired our nation. As the President said, it 'ignited our sense of adventure' and 'steeled our belief that no dream is impossible, no matter how lofty or challenging.' And as Buzz Aldrin said today, in his words, 'Looking back, landing on the moon wasn't just our job, it was a historic opportunity to prove to the world America's can-do spirit.' But as we lead in human space exploration again, we'll carry not only American ingenuity and pride, but most importantly, we'll carry America's ideals into the vast expanse of space - ideals of freedom and liberty. Apollo 11 is the only event in the 20th century that stands a chance of being widely remembered in the 30th century. A thousand years from now, July 20, 1969 will likely be a date that will live in the minds and imaginations of men and women, as long as there are men and women to remember - across this world, across this solar system, and beyond. So, today, we remember the heroes of Apollo 11 and all the heroes that supported them in their mission - some 400,000 Americans. But today, we also reaffirm our commitment to 'unlock the mysteries of space' and to lead. And as we continue on this American journey, we go with the same resolve and determination of those who have gone before. And we go with faith. Faith in the courage of this new generation of astronauts - men and women of the character and caliber of those who have gone before. They're remarkable pioneers who will carry American leadership into space. Faith in the ingenuity of the men and women of NASA and all of those across the American space enterprise, whose creativity and tireless efforts in the days ahead will match that of their forebears who created and invented new ways to explore and expanded human understanding with American leadership. And finally, I believe, as we go forward - and as millions of Americans believe in their hearts, and have throughout the generations - that we'll go forward with faith that as those pioneers put on the spacesuits and climb aboard the rockets, that we'll believe that even if they rise on the wings of the dawn, even if they go up to heavens, that even there His hand will guide them, and His right hand will hold them fast. And that'll be our prayer. Today, we mark the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11. We celebrate the heroic astronauts who accomplished that extraordinary feat in human history - and all those who supported them. And today, we resolve, for the sake of all they accomplished, that America will lead in space once again. And this nation will once again astonish the world with the heights we reach and the wonders we achieve. So may God bless the crew of Apollo 11 and all who supported them on their historic journey. May God bless this new generation of pioneers and all who will support them. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.",

TOBY MOVED FROM A HIGH RENT DISTRICT AND BROOKLYN COMES AT THE HIGHEST WITH DISTRICT IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW THESE DAYS. GOOD TO SEE YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT KIND INTRODUCTION. IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU TO HEAR THE STORIES COME TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THESE TOUGH TIMES, DIFFICULT TIMES. TODAY, TODAY'S STORY IS CERTAINLY ONE IN SOUTH FLORIDA. WE ARE ALL LIVING SOME VERSION OF IT RIGHT NOW WITH SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF OUR LIVES BEING PUT ON HOLD. THE SAME STORY BEING MOVED BY PEOPLE LIKE CARL WHO MANY OF YOU KNOW WELL. CARL IS HERE TODAY I'M TOLD. I DON'T KNOW , HEY, CARL. HOW WERE YOU, MAN? GOOD TO SEE HERE. LIGHT WAS SHINING LIGHT IN MY EYES LOOKING AT YOU, MAN. I APOLOGIZE. CARL IS 39 , NO, 93 WHEN HE ACTS LIKE HE'S 39 YEARS OLD. DOING SO MUCH IN THIS COMMITTEE, A FEW THANK YOU ALL DECIDED TO RENAME THIS COMMUNITY CENTER IN HIS HONOR. I'VE HEARD WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT YOU, , AND LOOK FORWARD TO SAY HELLO TO YOU PRIVATELY. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING CARL BACK IN 2012. HE MAY MAY NOT REMEMBER IT BUT HIS STORIES WITH HIS COMMUNITY AND THIS COUNTRY IS ALL ABOUT YOUR CARL IS A SIGN OF AN IMMIGRANT. CARL SERVED OUR NATION HONORABLY IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR, THAT IS SWEETHEART AND NEEDY, THE BEEN MARRIED NOW FOR 67 YEARS. TOGETHER THEY BUILT THE FAMILY, FOUR CHILDREN, SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN AND MORE THAN 30 YEARS THEY MADE THEIR HOME HERE, STAYING ENGAGED IN ALL THE LOCAL ISSUES. CATCHING SUNNY MATINEES AND PERFORMANCE AT THE ART CENTER AND THE CENTER, AND SOCIALIZING WITH NEIGHBORS AND TO JOIN NIGHTS IN THE TOWN AND A COUPLE TIMES, TO A THREE TIMES A WEEK GOING OUT. BUT THEIR STORY LIKE SO MANY OTHERS IS A A QUINTESSENTIAL AMERICAN STORY THESE DAYS. IT HAS BEEN INTERRUPTED THIS YEAR. CARL AND ANITA HAVE BEEN OUT I'M TOLD TO A IN SEVEN MONTHS AND THERE ARE NO MORE STANDING MATINEES OTHER THAN GETTING GROCERIES THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME IN THEIR APARTMENT LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE DO. IT'S HARDER THAN EVER TO SPEND TIME WITH THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE, OTHER THAN ON ZOOM OR ON A COMPUTER CONNECTION. WE HAVE ALL FELT THE SCENT OF INTERRUPTION IN OUR LIVES AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T NORMAL, THAT THINGS DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. WE LOOK AROUND AT OUR NEIGHBORS AND WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE HURTING. A LOT OF FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING THE NEXT RENT PAYMENT OR NEXT MORTGAGE PAYMENT. THEY ARE NOT ONLY, WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. WE SEALED OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE VERY TOP DOING BETTER THAN THEY HAVE EVER DONE, AND WONDER AN AWFUL LOT IS WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR ME? WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR ME? THAT'S BEEN THE STORY, THE ENTIRE STORY OF MY GIVE DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. THE FACT THAT HE HAS NEVER BEEN FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS. HE'S NEVER BEEN FOCUS ON YOU. HIS HANDLING OF THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN ERRATIC JUST LIKE HIS PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN. AND IT HAS PREVENTED FLORIDA SENIORS AND PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY FROM GIVING THE RELIEF THAT THEY NEED. DONALD TRUMP HAD NOT JUST BEEN WILLING TO NOT DO THE WORK. I THINK IT'S THAT JAN THAT I'M NOT SURE HE CARES ABOUT DELIVERING ANY REAL HELP. I THINK IT'S BOTH. PEOPLE SAFENET WILLING TO DO THE WORK. I DON'T THINK HE CARES MUCH ABOUT IT. WHILE WE ARE LOSING PRECIOUS TIME WITH YOUR LOVED ONES HE'S BEEN STUCK IN A SAND TRAP ON ONE OF HIS GOLF COURSES. AND WHEN HE DOES DECIDE TO LIFT A A FINGER IT ISN'T TO HELP YOU. IT'S TO PROPOSE NEW TAX CUTS FOR MILLIONAIRES. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. 100 WEALTHIEST BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA ARE EXPECTED TO GET ANOTHER $30 $30 BILLION TAX CUT HE IS PROPOSING. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME THAT TAX THAT WAS PASSED IN 2019, AFTER 2017 WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES GOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX BREAKS. AND THEN THEY TURNED AROUND AND RAISE RICES ARE MEDICINES THAT YOU RELY ON TO STAY HEALTHY. AND THEY ARE STILL DOING IT EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. QUITE FRANKLY IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE BUT TRUMP DOESN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT LOWERING THE HEALTHCARE COST BECAUSE HE IS BEHOLDEN TO HELP HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE DRUG COMPANIES. AFTER ALL, HE'S ASKING THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AS I SPEAK, ASKING RIGHT NOW TO STRIKE DOWN THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE SENIORS ABILITY, MOST OF YOU ARE ON MEDICARE, BUT IT WOULD ELIMINATE YOUR ABILITY IN THE ACT WE PASSED I WAS ABLE HELP PUT IN PLACE, WAS YOU HAVE PREVENTATIVE SERVICES, ANNUAL CHECKUPS AND MAMMOGRAMS FOR FREE UNDER MEDICARE. IF THEY GET STRUCK DOWN THAT GETS WIPED OUT AS WELL. THE RISING PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES FOR MANY SENIORS AND PUT MEDICARE TRUST FUND AT RISK. AND BY THE WAY, WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE MEDICARE TRUST FUND, I SEE THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO ELIMINATE IT BUT REMEMBER DEBBIE WILL REMEMBER, WHEN HE'S NOT A BAD GUY IN TERMS OF HIS PERSONALITY WHEN THE FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BECAME SPEAKER, , WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY PROPOSE HALF A BILLION DOLLARS CUT IN MEDICARE FROM THE START, RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THESE GUYS MEAN WHAT THEY SAY. THIS PRESIDENT , DEBBIE POINTED OUT, HE WANTS TO TERMINATE THE TAX, IS DEDICATED TO FINANCING SOURCES TO BECOME TERMINATE IT. SOCIAL SECURITY ACTUARY, NOT JOE BIDEN PORTABLE THINK TANK FOR A NEWSPAPER, THE ACTUARY, SOLSTICE COULD HE SAYS, THAT WOULD BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY IN JUST A FEW YEARS, PUTTING THOSE MONTHLY CHECKS FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF SENIORS WHO RELY ON, MANY OF THEM DO A THING TO RELY ON, AT RISK. ALL THIS PRESIDENT KNOWS HOW TO DO IS PLAY GAMES WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES AND FAMILIES FUTURES. LAST WEEK HE ANNOUNCED HE WAS QUOTE WALKING AWAY FROM THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WERE NEVER, INEVITABLY FULLY ENGAGE IN. HE NEVER FULLY ENGAGED WITH THEM. THEM. TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL RELIEF FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES. DEBBIE WORKING LIKE THE DOUBLE IN-HOUSE PASSED THE HEROES ACT. THEY PASSED TWO OF THE PIECES OF LEGISLATION EARLIER TO PROVIDE FOR THE ABILITY TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, PEOPLE BEING KICKED OUT OF THE HOMES. HE TURNED HIS BACK ON SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. HE TURNED HIS BACK ON FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS WHO DEPEND ON LOCAL BUDGETS BUT LOCAL BUDGETS ARE BEING BROKEN AND HAVE TO BE BALANCED. I WILL JUST TAKE, MAKE NO HERE. WHEN WE INHERITED THE LARGEST RECESSION, THE GREATEST RECESSION SINCE THE DEPRESSION, WHAT HAPPENED? PRESIDENT PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE RECOVERY ACT, $800 BILLION. FIRST THING I WAS ABLE TO DO WHEN I I WAS ABLE TO MANAGE IT MYSELF WAS THAT PUT $147 BILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES BE ABLE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS, NOT HAVE TO FIRE POLICE OFFICERS OR FIREFIGHTERS COME NOT FIRED FIRST RESPONDERS, NOT TOO CLOSE TO HEALTH CLINICS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR STRAIGHT TO THE BREAKING POINT TURKEY TURNED HIS BACK ON EDUCATORS AND SCHOOL CHILDREN, TOOK AWAY SUPPORT FROM PPE AND CLEANING SUPPLIES AND VENTILATION YOU TO REOPEN SCHOOL SAFETY WHICH WE COULD DO IF WE FUNDED IT. HE TURNS HIS BACK ON EVERY SINGLE WORKER WHOSE JOB HASN'T COME BACK. AND NOW HE SAYS HE WANTS A DEAL. ONE DAY HE'S TWEETING RELIEF PACKAGE IS TOO BIG, THE NEXT DAY SAYING IT'S TOO SMALL. IT'S ALL A GAME. HE THINKS HE IS STILL ON HIS GAME SHOW. NO, , REALLY, HE ASKED THAT WAY FOR REAL. THIS IS A FLUKE AGAIN HE IS PLAYING. HIS LATEST GIMMICK HE WANTS TO MAIL SENIORS AT $200 PRESCRIPTION DRUG CASH CARD WITH HIS NAME ON IT SO YOU GET IT BEFORE ELECTION WITH HIS NAME ON IT. BUT WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO IS HE'S GOING TO RAID MEDICARE TRUST FUND TO PAY FOR THAT $200 WHICH SENIORS HAVE ALREADY SPENT BY PAYING MONEY INTO. HE THINKS HE CAN TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKET WITH ONE HAND AND PUT IT BACK WITH HIS NAME STAMPED ON IT ON THE OTHER HAND. AND CALL IT A GIFT. IT'S DISHONEST. IT'S RECKLESS AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HELP ANYBODY. IN FACT, ALL IT DOES UNDERMINE THE MEDICARE TRUST FUND AND INCREASE OVERALL OUT-OF-POCKET COST FOR SENIORS. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS. DONALD TRUMP HAS TRIED FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS TO LOWER COME HE SAYS HE WANTS TO LOWER DRUG PRICES, OKAY? BUT HE HASN'T DONE A SINGLE THING TO DO IT. IN FACT, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED A BILL, DEBBIE SUPPORTED, THE BRINK OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS ACROSS THE BOARD GIVING MEDICARE THE POWER IN WASHINGTON THE POWER TO NEGOTIATE, TO NEGOTIATE TO THE DRUG COMPANIES AND SAY IF AN ASPEN IS GOING TO COST HIM BEING CHARGED, I'M MAKING THIS UP, IF AN ASPEN WILL COST TWO CENTS AN ASPEN, THEY SAY WILL ONLY PAY YOU A PENNY, THEY ARE EITHER GOING TO DO OR NOT. THEY WILL HAVE TO DO IT. WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO GET DEBBIE AND I AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO DO THIS FOR YEARS. WE LOWER DRUG PRICES. WHAT DID PRESIDENT TRUMP DO? HE SAID IF IT PASSES HE WILL VETO IT, THREATENED TO VETO IT. FOLKS, DONALD TRUMP'S CHAOTIC AND DECISIVE , DIVISIVE LEADERSHIP HAS COST US FAR TOO MUCH. 215,000 DEAD FROM COVID-19, AND RISING. EXPERTS SAY WE WILL LOSE NEARLY ANOTHER 200,000 LIVES IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS UNLESS HE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED COURSES. I PRAYED PRAY FOR HIS RECOVERY WHEN HE GOT COVID. I HOPE THAT WE COULD COME OUT OF IT, BUT WHAT IS HE DONE? HE HAS JUST DOUBLE DOWN ON MISINFORMATION HE DID BEFORE MAKING IT WORSE. SO MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT CARES MORE ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET THAN HE DOES ABOUT THE WELL-BEING OF SENIORS ONE DAY BEFORE RECROSS THE THRESHOLD OF 200,000 THIS, YOU MAY RECALL THIS, THE PRESIDENT WAS PRESIDENT WAS AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY AND INSISTED THAT THE VIRUS WAS, AND THE QUOTE, AFFECTS VIRTUALLY NOBODY QUOTE, JUST ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH HEART AND OTHER PROBLEMS. NOBODY, THINK ABOUT THAT. WHO WAS HE TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE SAID IT INFECTS VIRTUALLY NOBODY? HE IS TALKING ABOUT AMERICA'S SENIORS. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU, TALKING ABOUT MY FAMILY. YOU WORKED HARD TO WHOLE LIFE CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIETY, BUILDING A FAMILY, BUILDING THE COUNTRY, SERVING AMERICA. YOU DESERVE SECURITY, DESERVE RESPECT AND PEACE OF MIND BUT YOU ARE NOT GETTING IT. BY THE WAY, IF THIS WASN'T SO BIZARRE YOU WOULD THINK, IF I TRIED TO MAKE A MOVIE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN AMERICA YOU WOULD THINK I WAS MAKING IT UP. BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS SIMPLE, NON-JOE, YOU ARE EXPENDABLE. YOU ARE FORGETTABLE. YOU ARE VIRTUALLY NOBODY. THAT'S HOW HE SEES THIS. THAT'S HOW HE SEES YOU. IT'S NO SURPRISE, THIS IS THE SAME AND IT LOOKS IN THE MIRROR , PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE, CAUSING LOSERS AND SUCKERS. I CARRIED THIS CARD WITH ME EVERYDAY FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS, IT'S MY SCHEDULE. THE BACK OF THE SCHEDULE I HAVE BLACK BOX THAT SAYS DAILY TROOP UPDATE. THE NUMBER OF TROOPS WHO DIED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, 6924. 6924. ROUGHLY 6900. 924 BECAUSE OF YOU ONE OF THESE FALLEN ANGELS LEFT THE FAMILY BEHIND, DESERVES TO BE REMEMBERED. EVERYONE. U.S. TROOPS WOUNDED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, 53,000 AS OF TODAY. 194. EVERYONE. WITH ONLY ONE SACRED OBLIGATION IN AMERICA, TO CARE FOR THOSE WE SENT TO WAR AND EQUIP THEM WHEN THEY COME HOME TAKE CARE OF THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND WHAT DID HE SAY? LOSERS. MY SON VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. BEFORE THAT HE HAD BEEN IN KOSOVO FOR EIGHT MONTHS. BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THE ONLY FOREIGNER HAS A WAR MONUMENT AND A MAJOR HIGHWAY IN THAT COUNTRY NAMED AFTER HIM FOR HIS CONTRIBUTION TO HELP THEM SET UP THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEN HE VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO IRAQ AS ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR A YEAR. MY SON WAS NOT A LOSER. AND ALL THOSE LEFT BEHIND COME HE PASSED AWAY BUT ALL THOSE HE LEFT BEHIND, THEY ARE HEROES, THEY ARE PATRIOTS. I IMAGINE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON WHY SIX 4-STAR GENERAL AND A LOT OF OTHERS ENDORSE ME TO USE TO WORK FOR HIM BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHERE HIS HEART ISN'T. THAT'S HOW HE SEES US. THAT'S THE ATTITUDE HAS BROUGHT THROUGH THIS WHOLE CRISIS. THIS IS THE SAME MAN YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS TOLD WE WERE AVERAGING 1000 LIVES LOST PER DAY. REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID IT IS WHAT IT IS. SUCH CONCERN AND EMPATHY. IT IS WHAT IT IS. WELL, IT IS WHAT IT IS BECAUSE HE IS WHO HE IS. THAT'S WHY IT IS WHAT IT IS. THIS PRESIDENT AS DEBBIE REFERENCED, BACK IN JANUARY WHEN HE WAS BEING BRIEFED BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HE SAID I NEVER READ THE BRIEFING. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT. DIDN'T HAVE TIME. WELL, HIS EGO MOVED IN TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE FAMOUS JOURNALIST TO WRITE SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT HIM. WHAT HAPPENED? BOB WOODWARD INTERVIEWED HIM. HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE KNEW IT WAS A DANGEROUS AND HIGHLY COMMUNICABLE DISEASE, BUT HE DID NOTHING. HE DIDN'T DO A THING. HE DIDN'T TELL YOU. HE DIDN'T TELL ANY AMERICAN. WHY? HE TOLD WOODWARD ON TAPE, TOLD BOB WOODWARD HE DIDN'T WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. AMERICANS DON'T PANIC. TRUMP PANICS. HIS RECKLESS PERSONAL CONDUCT SINCE HIS DIAGNOSIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE. THE LONGER DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT THE MORE RECKLESSLY SEEMS TO GET. THANK GOD WILL HAVE THREE WEEKS LEFT TO GO TO DR. FAUCI, MOST RESPECTED DOCTOR IN THE COUNTRY ON THIS DISEASE, REFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE SUPREME COURT IN THE ROSE GARDEN USING THE WHITE HOUSE AS A BACKDROP FOR POLITICAL EVENTS, HE SAID IT WAS A SUPER SPREADER EVENT. AND HOW IS TRUMP RESPONDING? HE'S RUNNING A NATIONAL AD QUOTING DR. FAUCI OUT OF CONTEXT. WITHOUT YOU SAID WAY BACK IN MARCH, REFERRING TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ACROSS THE NATION, HE SAID, QUOTE, I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY COULD BE DOING MORE COME IN THE QUOTE MEANING PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. AT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL IT DOES I GOT A PIECE THE COMPANY TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS DELIBERATELY LIED. THEY HAVE PUT DR. FAUCI IN THEIR AD, ASSERTING THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT TRUMP WHEN HE SAID HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE ANY MORE. BUT HOW CHEAP IS A MAN OF INTEGRITY , BUT DR. FAUCI IS MEANT OF INTEGRITY. AFTER THE AD CAME OUT HE SAID I I DID NOT GIVE PERMISSION TO USE THAT QUOTE AND I WASN'T REFERRING TO THE PRESIDENT. EVEN AFTER DR. FAUCI SAID THAT COME HE DIDN'T SAY THAT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. TRUMP AD CAMPAIGN SAID THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO USE THE ADD, KNOWING, KNOWING IT WAS A LIE. CAN ANY OF YOU EVER REMEMBER ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE PRESIDENT TO CAMPAIGN THE MAINSTREAM CANDIDATE, AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THE MONTHS OF LIFE, MISLEADING AND RESPONSIBLE ACTION A PART OF DONALD TRUMP, HOW MANY INTO CHAIRS AROUND THE DINING ROOM TABLE TONIGHT BECAUSE OF HIS NEGLIGENCE? HOW MANY PEOPLE HEARTS ARE BROKEN? HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE GOING TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, CAN'T JUST REACH OVER AND TOUCH? THEY CAN HEAR THEIR SONS OR DAUGHTERS VOICE ON THE PHONE. WELL, HE THROWS SUPER SPREADER PARTIES AT THE WHITE HOUSE, REPUBLICANS HELD EACH OTHER WITHOUT CONCERN OF THE CONSEQUENCES. HOW MANY OF YOU BEEN UNABLE TO HUG YOUR GRANDKIDS IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS? I GOT SIX OF THEM. TWO HAVE BEEN BEEN MY DECEASED SONS BOYS, CHILDREN, , A BOY AND GIRL, LIVE NOT FAR FROM IT. BILLY RAY CONCEDED, I STAND ON THE BACK PORCH AND A STANDDOWN AND I BRIBE THEM WITH HAAGEN-DAZS BARS. BUT EVERY SINGLE DAY I CONTACT THEM. I CAN'T HUG THEM. I CAN'T EMBRACE THEM. AND I'M LUCKIER THAN MOST BECAUSE THE ARE NEARBY, THOSE TWO OF THE SIX. MY GRANDKIDS, YOUR GRANDKIDS, HOPE WILL GROW TO TREAT ONE OF THE AS KINDNESS, RESPECT AND EMPATHY. QUALITIES THE PRESIDENT HAS NEVER EVER SHOWN. IT HAS BECOME PAINFULLY CLEAR AS CARELESS RESPONSE HAS CAUSED ONE OF THE WORST TRAGEDIES IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THE ONLY SENIOR THAT DONALD TRUMP CARES ABOUT, THE ONLY SENIOR IS SENIOR DONALD TRUMP. DOESN'T SEEM TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIM. AND BY THE WAY, MINORITY COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING PARTICULARLY HIT BY THIS. WE REALIZE AS OF ABOUT A MONTH AGO, ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS ONE IN 1000 AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN ALL OF AMERICA HAVE DIED. THE ESTIMATE IS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR ONE IN 500 AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND AMERICAN WILL DIE. ONE IN 500. IF HE DOESN'T DO SOMETHING QUICKLY AND WE HIT 400,000, THAT IS MORE PEOPLE, SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT DIED, 400,000 DEAD, THEN WORLD WAR II. IN LESS THAN A YEAR IF HE DOESN'T MOVE. THE ONLY ONE DOUBLE TROUBLE DO ANYTHING FOR HIS DONALD TRUMP. LOOK, FOLKS, YOU ALL KNOW THIS. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE CAN CONTAIN THIS VIRUS. WE CAN FULLY REOPEN OUR ECONOMY WE CAN BRING CONGRESS TOGETHER TO PASS REAL RELIEF AND IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA TO BUILD BACK BETTER. MY ECONOMIC PROPOSAL, AND BY THE WAY IT'S NOT A LIBERAL THINK TANK FOR DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK THAT SAYS THIS. AND IF THE ANALYSIS PUT OUT MY MOOD IS, A WALL STREET FIRM, PROJECTS THAT MY ECONOMIC PLAN WILL CREATE 18.6 MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS BETWEEN NOW AND IN THE FIRST TERM. 7 MILLION MORE JOBS THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN, AND CREATE A TRULY MORE DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. IT'S SOLID, IT'S REAL. HERE'S HOW MY PLAN WORKS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON A SINGLE SOLITARY AMERICAN MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. WILL NOT PAY A PENNY MORE, IT SECURITY. I'M GOING AS BIG CORPORATIONS AND WEALTHY TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE TAX STRUCTURE. THAT MONEY WILL ALLOW US TO INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE WHO CARRY WITH IT I DON'T KNOW IF IT WITH ME NOW, I DON'T, A CARD THAT LISTS ALL OF WHAT IS IN THE TAX CODE. WE WENT AHEAD, PRESIDENT'S TAX PLAN, BARACK AND I'M SUGGESTING WE REDUCED CORPORATE TAX FROM 35% TO 28. 28. I WAS A CONSENSUS. HE REDUCED IT TO 21 DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE COST? $1.3 TRILLION. WE JUST TAKE IT BACK UP TO 28 AND IT WILL GENERATE $1.3 TRILLION MORE. .. CUT THE TAX AND 35 TO 21. THE SENATE RACING BACK TO 28%. $1.3 TRILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE INSTEAD OF DOING BIG CORPORATIONS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS FOR BUYBACK IN THEIR OWN STOCK, MOVING OVERSEAS, WE SHOULD INVEST IN CANCER, DIABETES, ALL LEVERS AND PARKINSON'S I PROPOSE GIVING NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH $50 BILLION OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, CANCER, DIABETES, OLD-TIMERS AND PARKINSON'S. IF WE DO NOT FIND AN ANSWER TO ALZHEIMER'S WITHIN THE NEXT 19 YEARS, EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY BED THAT EXISTS IN THE U.S. NOW WILL BE OCCUPIED BY OLD-TIMERS PATIENTS. MY DAD USED TO HAVE THIS EXPRESSION, JOE, IF EVERYTHING IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU, NOTHING IS IMPORTANT. WHERE OUR PRIORITIES? OUR PRIORITIES ARE TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IN AMERICA HAS AN EQUAL SHOT. IT'S ABOUT YOU, WHAT'S FAIR, ABOUT WHAT OUR PRIORITIES SHOULD BE WE CAN DEAL WITH CANCER IN THESE OTHER DISEASES BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS NO INTEREST. HE WANTS TO DO THE OPPOSITE. PROPOSES MORE TAX CUTS. DONALD TRUMP, EASE THE BURDEN ON MAJOR COSTS IN YOUR LIFE INCLUDING A FINANCIAL BURDEN IN CAREGIVING FOR MANY FAMILIES WITHOUT CARING. RIGHT NOW, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, 800,000 AMERICANS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HOME COMMUNITY CARE, SIGNED UP FOR, AN AVERAGE OF FIVE YEARS WAITING. FOR SOME, FIVE YEARS, MY PLAN MAKES INVESTMENTS SO THE STATE CAN CLEAR THE WAITING LIST. THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO ALLOW MEDICAID TO AGAIN USE IT NORMA'S PARTY AND NEGOTIATE PRICES AND BRING THE COST DOWN FOR EVERYONE. GIVING ALL AMERICANS ACCESS THEY ALSO HATE MY DOING, SO DO THE DRUG COMPANIES. THE EXPERTS TO SET PRICES, LIFE-SAVING DRUGS THAT COST AN ARM AND A LEG FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY. THEY HAVE NO COMPETITION, THE BOARD WAS SET UP AND SAY THIS IS HOW MUCH YOU BEEN CHARGED BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE INVESTED, WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE THE PRICE OF THE DRUG WITHOUT TAKING OTHER ACTION THAT HAS REQUIRED YOU TO IMPROVE THE DRUG. IT CAN ONLY BE RAISED WITH MEDICAL INFLATION. INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS FOUND MY LAND/COST BY 60%. HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S HAD TO SELL THINGS JUST TO GET THE DRUGS HAVE GROWN UP EXPONENTIALLY? WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND INCREASED BENEFITS FOR MILLIONS OF SENIORS TO PROTECT YOUR PENSION INCLUDING PENSIONS, SO MANY FLORIDIANS EARN AND DESERVE. FOLKS, I WILL END WITH THIS, I AM CONFIDENT AS BAD AS THINGS ARE, HOW CAN I GET BETTER? I AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT WE CAN DO THIS AND MORE. WE JUST HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. A PROUD DEMOCRAT AND WILLING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. GOING TO WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO VOTE AGAINST ME AS THOSE WHO VOTED FOR ME. THAT IS THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT PRESIDENT. A DUTY TO CARE, TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, ALL AMERICA HAS ACCOMPLISHED, ALL THE YEARS WE SERVE AS A BEACON TO THE WORLD, WE CANNOT LET OURSELVES REMAIN DIVIDED. WE HAVE TO VOTE. GO TO I WILL VOTE.COM/FL. CAN STILL REQUEST YOUR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. DEADLINE IS OCTOBER 24. REQUEST YOUR BALLOT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY, MAIL IT OR DROP IT IN A DROP BOX TODAY AND TIRED OF US ALL WALKING AROUND WITH OUR HEADS DOWN AS IF THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY, NOTHING WE'VE EVER DECIDED TO DO, IS NOT ACCOMPLISHED. WE'VE DONE TOGETHER. REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE KIDS, YOU HAD TO LEARN ABOUT JOHN KENNEDY GOING TO THE MOON, EVERYBODY REMEMBERS THE DIFFERENT PIECES OF IT. THEY USED TO KIDNEY IN THE SENATE WHAT I WAS THE. ANSWERING THE UNASKED QUESTION, WHY WAS HE DOING? HE SAID BECAUSE WE REFUSED TO POSTPONE. REFUSED TO POSTPONE ONE MORE DAY WITHIN OUR CAPACITY AS AMERICANS AMERICANS, THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. NO LIMIT TO OUR FUTURE. WE GOT TO STAND UP, LIFT OUR HEADS UP THE ONLY THING THAT CAN AMERICA IS A AMERICA ITSELF. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID. WHO WE ARE, WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. SIGNS OVER FICTION. YET, TRUTH OVER LIVES. WE CAN DO THIS AND I PROMISE YOU YOU, MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANKS. EVERY TIME I USED TO WALK OUT OF MY GRANDPA'S IN PENNSYLVANIA, HE WOULD YELL JOEY, KEEP THE FAITH AND MY GRANDMA SAID NO JOEY, SPREAD IT. THANKS, EVERYBODY.",

TONIGHT IN KEEPING WITH THE LATEST GUIDANCE FROM THE CDC, TO AVOID GATHERINGS OF MORE THAN 10 PEOPLE, I'M SPEAKING TO YOU FROM MY HOME IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. I HOPE ALL OF YOU ARE STAYING SAFE. TALKING AND TAKING THE RECOMMENDED PRECAUTIONS AND TALKING IT TO THE DOCTORS IF YOU HAVE ONE, TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. SLOW THE SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS. THIS PANDEMIC HAS IMPACTED EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES. AND EVERY ASPECT OF THIS CAMPAIGN. MOST OF ALL, MY HEART GOES OUT TO ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE. THOSE WHO CONTRACTED THE VIRUS. ALL OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS WORKING HARDER THAN EVER TO HELP THEIR NEIGHBORS. TO HELP THOSE CHILDREN AT HOME OR SCHOOL AND ARE WORRIED AND DON'T KNOW WHY. DOCTORS, NURSES, EMTS, PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS, AS WELL AS FRONT-LINE EMERGENCY WORKERS LIKE FIREFIGHTERS AND DEDICATED FOLKS WORKING TO KEEP SHELVES STOCKED IN THE GROCERY STORES. TACKLING THIS PANDEMIC IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY, LOOK INTO FIGHTING A WAR. IT WILL REQUIRE LEADERSHIP AND COOPERATION FROM EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. IT WILL REQUIRE US TO MOVE THOUGHTFULLY AND DECISIVELY TO QUICKLY ADDRESS BOTH THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT WILL REQUIRE US TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC HEALTH EXPERTS. IT WILL REQUIRE EACH OF US TO DO OUR PART. YES, THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE WE NEED OUR LEADERS TO LEAD, BUT ALSO A MOMENT WHERE THE CHOICES AND DECISIONS WE MAKE AS INDIVIDUALS WILL COLLECTIVELY IMPACT WHAT HAPPENS. MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE SEVERITY OF THIS OUTBREAK AND PREPARING OUR MEDICAL SYSTEMS TO HANDLE IT. I KNOW WE AS A PEOPLE ARE UP TO THIS CHALLENGE, WE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. WE WILL ANSWER THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS WITH THE BEST WE FIND IN ALL OF US. THAT'S WHAT AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE AND WHAT WE DO. THAT'S WHO WE ARE. ORDINARY PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WHEN THE NEED ARISES. TODAY, WE ARE MOVING QUICKLY TO ATTRACT OUR ROUTINES TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE. AMERICANS IN THREE STRAIGHT , STATES WENT TO THE POLLS. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND POLL WORKERS WHO WORKED WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES TO SHARE SAFE OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOTING. MAKING SURE THE VOTERS CAN CAST THEIR BALLOTS WHILE MAINTAINING A DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER THAT WAS SAFE. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET THROUGH THIS CRISIS, PROTECTING BOTH PUBLIC HEALTH AND DEMOCRACY. TODAY, IT LOOKS LIKE ONCE AGAIN IN FLORIDA AND ILLINOIS, WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM ARIZONA, OUR CAMPAIGN HAS A GOOD NIGHT. WE MOVE CLOSER TO SECURING THE NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT. WE ARE DOING IT BY DOING A BROAD COALITION. WE NEED TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. WITH STRONG SUPPORT TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, LATINO COMMUNITY, HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATED FOLKS I GREW UP WITH IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD. TEACHERS, SUBURBAN WOMEN, VETERANS, FIREFIGHTERS, AND SO MANY MORE. WE ARE DOING IT WITH A COMMON VISION. SENATOR SANDERS AND I MAY DISAGREE ON TACTICS, BUT WE SHARE A COMMON VISION. FOR THE NEED TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS, REDUCING COMMON EQUITY THAT HAS RISEN SO DRASTICALLY, TO TACKLING THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF OUR TIME, CLIMATE CHANGE.

         "Thank you, President Towey. Thank you for , thank you for your kindness. Thank you for your friendship. I actually gave him a ride on Air Force Two just so he could make it back for this event. (Laughter.) Give a big round of applause for a man that's made an incredible difference in the life of this university , Jim Towey. (Applause.) Truly a servant leader and a humble man, and a great, great friend to everything that we cherish. Thank you all for that wonderful, warm welcome. I will tell you that that introduction was gracious and kind, but Jim knows the one I prefer is even shorter: I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order, and it's an honor to be with all of you today. (Applause.) To Chairman Timmis, to the Board of Trustees, distinguished members of the faculty, to the students of this remarkable school: It is an honor here to join you in this place, founded in fidelity to Christ, Ave Maria University. Give yourselves a round of applause. (Applause.) A special place. And allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine and a great friend of the state of Florida, of this great university, and a champion of people of faith across this country and around the world. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, as the President said at the National Prayer Breakfast earlier this year, in his words, 'Since the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides , from gaining independence, to abolition, to civil rights have been led by people of faith and started prayer.' And I'm here, first and foremost, to thank the entire community here at Ave Maria University for the critical work you do to educate America's next generation of leaders, public servants, and leaders in faith all across America. Give this faculty a round of applause, will you, please? (Applause.) And as I just learned during a tour of your museum, Ave Maria instills a strong sense of responsibility and compassion, mission and self-sacrifice, in its students through its first-of-its-kind program in the world, the Mother Teresa Project. It's truly inspiring. In this academic year alone, I learned that students in the Mother Teresa Project have volunteered thousands of hours with Habitat for Humanity in local schools, in nursing homes, and in missions across the globe , from Mexico, to Uganda, to India. So thank you for putting feet on your faith, impacting this community, this state, our nation, and the world. We're proud of all of you. (Applause.) And through it all, you've carried forth the values that we share, and chief among them, the men and women of Ave Maria University have stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.) You know, I've long believed that a society can be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable: the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn. And I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside the most pro-life President in American history, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The record speaks for itself. In one of his first acts as President, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, preventing taxpayer dollars from funding abortion or abortion providers around the world. And we recently expanded that policy just in the past few days. Here at home, President Trump signed a law making it possible for all 50 states to defund Planned Parenthood. (Applause.) The truth is , and I see it in the shining faces here at Ave Maria University , life is winning in America. Particularly more and more young people across this country are embracing the sanctity of life. But for all the progress we're making at the very moment that more Americans than ever before are embracing the sanctity of life, the truth is: Leading members of the Democratic Party across this country are embracing a radical agenda of abortion on demand. You've seen it in the newspapers. In state legislatures across the country, Democrats have endorsed late-term abortion. In fact, the Governor of Virginia openly defended infanticide just a few short weeks ago. And Democrats in the United States Senate , and you deserve to know , including every Democrat senator running for President voted, against a bill that would protect children who had been born alive. The truth is, with Democrats standing for late-term abortion, infanticide, and a culture of death, I promise you this President, our party, and this movement will always stand for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.) Just like Ave Maria did, not long ago, it was just a few years ago when Ave Maria didn't bow to the dictates of the last administration. This university stood strong for conscience and values. Ave Maria spoke out against the last administration's attempt to force employers to provide health insurance plans that violated pro-life principles within Obamacare. And not only did Ave Maria University refuse to comply with that mandate, you challenged it and you won. (Applause.) And we commend you for your stand. And President Trump promised to stand with you , and we did , and all of those struggling under that HHS mandate, which is why we created a religious and moral exemption to the federal rule, so that all Americans can live out their faith freely in the healthcare system of this country. (Applause.) You know, the truth is, Obamacare restricted freedom, and it's reduced choices. And Obamacare has failed. And American families and businesses are still paying the price. We all remember the broken promises of Obamacare. They told us if you liked your doctor, you could keep your doctor; if you liked your health plan, you could keep it; that if Obamacare passed, health insurance premiums would go down. But unfortunately, none of that was true. Costs have skyrocketed. Premiums on the individual market rose by more than 100 percent. Choices have plummeted. And more and more insurance companies have pulled out of the marketplace entirely. And as Obamacare fails, you deserve to know that Democrats are continuing in their quest for a government takeover of healthcare. They're opening calling for socialized medicine under the guise of Medicare for All. Well, the truth of the matter is, Medicare for All means quality healthcare for none. Socialized medicine will lead our country to ration healthcare and to government bureaucrats making the most important decisions affecting our lives and the lives of our loved ones. But as President Trump said just recently, soon the Republican Party will become known as the 'Party of Healthcare.' And we're going to have a great healthcare plan for all of the American people. (Applause.) This week, the President took a decisive step to repeal and replace Obamacare. And I want to promise you: We will never give up, we will never relent, in our effort to put American healthcare back on the path to more choices, more affordability, built on the principles of freedom and the doctor-patient relationship. That's our pledge to each of you in this rising generation. And let me assure all of you here in the Ave Maria community: You also have an ally and a champion in President Trump when it comes to our core freedoms. We will always stand with you, as we will always stand with all those who share our values. We will always defend your fundamental right to freedom. As we all learned from our youth, the United States was forged in religious freedom. Our first settlers were pilgrims who left everything and set sail for a New World; carved out a new home in the wilderness where they could practice their faith freely and without fear of persecution. And after this great nation secured our independence, the American Founders enshrined that first freedom in our First Amendment with these words: that 'Congress shall make no law respecting establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' Our Founders knew that this precious liberty was not granted by government and could not be granted by government. They knew, as we know today, that we are 'endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.' And the truth is, as I stand before you today, freedom of religion is increasingly under attack here at home. Lately, it's actually become fashionable for media elites and Hollywood liberals to mock religious belief. My own family became the target of these attacks after my wife went back to teach art at a Christian school. So let me say from my heart , not for us, but for every believer in this country: These attacks on believing Christians and Christian education are wrong, and they must stop. (Applause.) They're antithetical to our great American tradition. And, frankly, they should be rejected by every American of every faith. Now, I'm proud to say, since day one of this administration, President Trump has taken bold action to protect religious liberty and the freedom of conscience of every American of every faith tradition. In our first year, the President declared, in his words, that the 'federal government will never, ever penalize any person for their protected religious beliefs,' and he directed the Department of Justice to develop new protections for Americans of faith. We made sure the free exercise of religion doesn't stop at the doors of our churches or houses of worship when we suspended enforcement of the Johnson Amendment and we freed up the voices of religious leaders all over the country. (Applause.) Just last week, President Trump signed an executive order, as well, to ensure that America's First Amendment protections extend to every college and university campus in America. (Applause.) And I want to promise you: Wherever your countries take you from here, Ave Maria University, we will always stand with thoughtful young men and women like you across this country who deserve to live out your faith, live out your values without repercussions or persecution. There should be no 'safe zones' from the God-given liberties of the American people. And we will stand for the freedom of speech, the freedom of expression on every campus in America. (Applause.) Now, as we defend liberty here at home, our administration has been standing strong for freedom around the world. And nowhere is that more true than in the stand that we've taken for freedom and democracy in Venezuela. Let me take this opportunity to thank a local leader, who's a national leader. He's been a champion of freedom in this hemisphere and a champion of restoring freedom and liberty and democracy for the Venezuelan people. Would you join me in thanking Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart for his outstanding leadership for freedom? (Applause.) He's been a great champion, along with both of your senators, for the restoration of freedom in Venezuela. And, Mario, we're proud and grateful , grateful for your heart for libertad. You know, the truth is Venezuela was once one of the richest and most vibrant democracies in the Western Hemisphere. By some estimates, Venezuela actually is home to the largest oil reserves in the world. But under the brutal regime of the dictator Nicolas Maduro and his socialist rule, it's become one of the poorest and most despotic countries in the world. Today, 9 out of 10 Venezuelans live in poverty. More than 3 million people have already abandoned their homes and fled the brutality of the Maduro regime. I was recently in Colombia and met with families who had fled not just the oppression but the starvation that's facing millions in that once rich country. It was heartbreaking, a story that I heard in my first trip to Colombia, of a grandmother who had gathered up her five grandchildren and made the long march across Venezuela to the Colombia border two years ago, because she said it had gotten so bad in her village that her grandchildren had to rise at four in the morning to get a ticket that they could exchange for a single piece of bread at four in the afternoon. And I'm proud to say, since early in this administration, with the strong support of leaders in Congress, President Trump has led an effort to isolate the dictator Maduro through economic and diplomatic means. The United States was proud to be the first nation on Earth to recognize Interim President Juan Guaid� as the rightful President of Venezuela. And now, more than 50 nations have joined us. (Applause.) Yesterday, President Trump and I met at the White House with Fabiana, the wife of Juan Guaid�. She's 26 years old , a young woman of extraordinary courage and grace. She'll meet today with our First Lady, Melania Trump, here in Florida. We told her then, in the Oval Office of the White House, the United States will continue to stand with her, with President Guaid�, and with the people of Venezuela until their libertad and democracy is restored. (Applause.) So we've been standing for freedom. For, as many of you have seen firsthand on your mission trips around the world, religious liberty is also under attack. Today, tragically, 82 percent of the world's people live in nations where religious freedom is either threatened or banned outright. The list of religious freedom violators is long. Their crimes and oppression span the width and breadth of our globe. Here in our own hemisphere, the government of Daniel Ortega is virtually waging war on the Nicaraguan Catholic Church. Government-backed mobs armed with machetes and even heavy weapons have attacked parishes and churches. Bishops and priests have been physically assaulted by their secret police. And hundreds of courageous Nicaraguans have died in the cause of freedom in the last year alone. I'll never forget the day I met one of those parish priests at a conference at the State Department. He talked about the siege of their church and how young people had come in to take shelter, and that when it was all over and the violence had ended and they left, he walked up to me and he said there was a young man in the group who described himself as an atheist. But as they were walking out of the church, he walked up to that courageous priest; he had seen his faith in action. He had seen him pray under a hail of gunfire; put himself in harm's way to protect the other young people there. And he said, that young man who said he was an atheist , said, and I quote , he said, 'Father, I don't believe in God. But if I ever believe in God, I'm going to believe in your God.' That's faith. That's courage in action. And we will stand for freedom for the people of Nicaragua, and we will stand with the people of faith in that nation. (Applause.) Farther from home, but close to our hearts, the world watched in horror earlier this month as a terrorist murdered 50 innocent Muslims at prayer in New Zealand. It was a horrific sight, and our hearts and our prayers went out and go out to every member of the community that was affected and the people of New Zealand. No one should ever fear for their safety in a place of worship , be that a mosque, or a church, or a synagogue , anywhere in the world. (Applause.) The hateful animus that motivated that killer is to be condemned universally around the world. And all of us are also witnessing the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism. It's rearing its ugly head , from Iran, to Europe, even in the halls Congress. Let me be clear on this: Anti-Semitism is not just wrong; it's evil. And anti-Semitism, like every form of racism, must be confronted wherever and whenever it arises, and it must be universally condemned. (Applause.) The truth is, nowhere have people of faith faced greater threats than in the ancient lands where the world's three great religions were born across the Middle East. Since 2014, the brutal regime of ISIS murdered thousands of Christians and forced hundreds of thousands of them to flee their homes. And it's not just Christians. Believers of many other faiths have suffered grievously at ISIS's hands, including Muslims, Druze, and Yazidis. I met this week with the Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament in my office, and we spoke of the barbarous reign of ISIS in its time and how they particularly targeted religious minorities and Christians. The good news is, President Trump promised to destroy the ISIS caliphate. And thanks to the courage of our armed forces and this Commander-in-Chief, America and our allies delivered. The ISIS caliphate is no more. (Applause.) As the world learned just last weekend, the last inch of control of the ISIS caliphate was captured by American forces and by our allies in the region. And while we've liberated millions of religious minorities and captive Christians across the Middle East from the grip of ISIS, I'm proud to tell you that we've also been helping persecuted communities rebuild their communities and their lives, and replant their roots in their ancestral homes so destroyed by war. At President Trump's direction, for the first time ever, the United States of America is providing direct support to Christians and religious minorities in the Middle East to rebuild their communities. (Applause.) As I stand before you today, we've already committed more than $340 million in aid. And, I'm proud to say, we're continuing to work with a strong range of nongovernmental organizations , NGOs, as they are known , including the great ministry of the Knights of Columbus. (Applause.) We're going to rebuild these communities. We're going to work with our partners across the Nineveh Plain, Iraq, the Kurdish region of Iraq. And we're going to see these communities come home. Religious persecution is also growing in the world's most populous nation: China. The State Department's annual International Religious Freedom report has labeled China as a religious freedom violator every year since 1999. As we stand here today, Beijing is holding possibly millions of Muslim Uighurs in so-called 're-education camps' in Western China. Chinese authorities have banned the sale of Christian Bibles. They've destroyed thousands of crosses and other church symbols. And they've jailed pastors. Even now, the Chinese government is using the power of cutting-edge technology to develop large-scale systems of surveillance to track its citizens , an effort that our Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Freedom, Sam Brownback, called 'the future of repression.' These are historic human rights abuses, and I want to promise all of you: Our administration is going to continue to stand strong and speak out and work to convince China that these practices are abhorrent and they should be stopped. (Applause.) But despite the heavy hand of that government, the good news is, the good news is spreading. (Laughter.) And the truth is, nowhere in its history has the Church grown as quickly as it's growing in China. Seventy years ago, when the Communist Party took power, there were less than half a million Chinese Christians. Today, just two generations later, some estimate that there are 130 Christians living throughout China, proving once again what's been true throughout the history of the Church: When persecution comes, faith grows. Persecuted Christians around the world deserve our prayers. And they will always have the support of the American people. (Applause.) As you venture out on mission trips, know that our administration will always continue to stand for liberty and religious liberty throughout the wider world. You know, it really is an honor to be with all of you , these incredible, bright shining faces here at Ave Maria University. Just think of me as a warm-up act for commencement in five weeks. (Laughter.) But I'm here to tell you this is a serious time in the life of our nation. And to stand before such impressive young men and women, it's a great honor for me and it's a privilege. The truth is, in the next 19 months, America will face a choice. And the challenge before us is not just about winning an election; we must win the next generation. And that's where you all come in. Your faith, your integrity, your character , all of which the foundation has been strengthened here at Ave Maria University , will make you leaders in the rising generation. You'll stand out. So I want to offer you a challenge: What you've seen and heard and learned in the hallways of this still-young university, carry from here as you lead lives of consequence in your generation. Live out your faith. Live out your values. 'Always be prepared,' as the Bible tells us, 'to give a reason for the hope that you have, but do so with gentleness and respect.' On my way here, on Air Force Two, I was reading in my morning devotions the story of the farmer that went out to sow seed in Luke, Chapter 8. The story reads, 'The seed that fell on good soil, it yielded a crop 100 times more than was sown.' And I stand before this impressive group of young people, and those looking on, to say that's what you must aspire to be. It's interesting that Jesus later pulled aside his disciples and explained to them what the meaning of the parable was and how it had to do with the character of the men and women. He said, and I quote, 'The seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and, by persevering, produce a crop.'So I want to challenge each one of you to act on those words in your life. First, be hearers of the word. You know, it's always struck me that Psalm 1, Psalm 19, and Psalm 119 , the first Psalm and the longest Psalm , all have to do with one idea, and that is: Read the word. Take time in your life. Blessed is a man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners, or sit in the seat of mockers, but what? His delight is in the law of the Lord, and on His law he meditates day and night, and be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he or she does prospers. What a promise. So I'd just encourage you, as a fellow believer: Hear it, retain it, live it out as best you can, and persevere. I don't know if you caught that in the verse, but it said, by 'persevering' it produced a crop. And the truth is, those of you who are willing to stand for faith and values in this rising generation, you're going to face criticism and what passes in this country for persecution. That's where your perseverance comes in, to turn your face like flint against the wind, and smile and show that conviction and show that love to everybody that you meet. You know, I'll always believe the essence of leadership is what's in your heart. People follow people that they trust. And when you know somebody's heart, you trust them. So let people see your heart and persevere. Now, my favorite President is the one I go to work with every day. (Laughter.) But one of my other favorites was Calvin Coolidge, who had some words about perseverance that I've actually got tacked to the bulletin board in our office at the Vice President's Residence, and they're really words to live by. Calvin Coolidge was a man of faith. He was also a Vice President. (Laughter.) He'd been a governor. (Laughter.) But I digress. (Laughter.) Calvin Coolidge said, and I quote, 'Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On!' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.' So I encourage you to press on and know that you can make a difference. Be men and women with good and noble hearts. Store up God's word in those hearts. Retain it and preserve. And remember the words I read a little bit later in Luke, Chapter 8, as well. There's a reason you're here. There's a reason all of you have been blessed with an education of this magnitude with such a solid foundation and timeless values, and to the ideals that have made this country great. I think it can be found in the rest of that chapter to remember no one , 'No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar and puts it under a bed. Instead he puts it on a stand so that those who come in can see .' When you leave here and you leave Ave Maria University, let your light shine. You'll make a difference in the life of this nation and in the world. So thank you for the honor of addressing all of you today. The future beckons, and I believe it will be a future where we , with men and women in this rising generation, where we recommit ourselves to all the ideals that have always made this country strong and prosperous and secure and free. It's going to be a foundation forged on our most cherished institutions of faith and family and freedom. I believe it with all my heart. I see it happening all over the country, everywhere I go. And as you do that, as you step out as leaders, I just saw, a few moments ago, one last admonition from Mother Teresa, and I'm going to take it back with me. She said, 'At the end of life, we will not be judged by how many diplomas we've received, how much money we've made, how many great things we have done. We will be judged by 'I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was naked, and you clothed me. I was homeless, and you took me in.' Be men and women of compassion, men and women of conviction. Be men and women who are leading in this generation. And I know that, as you live out that high calling , with your example, with your lives of consequence, with great institutions like Ave Maria University, with strong leaders elected at every level around the country who share our values, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God's help , I know we're just getting started. And we will make America great again. Thank you all very much. (Applause.) God bless you. And God bless America.",

GEORGIA, THEY DID NOT SEE YOU COMING, BUT HERE WE ARE. HERE IS , SHE ISN'T IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT KAMALA HARRIS. I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT. YOU FLIPPED THIS STATE BLUE. AND COME JANUARY 5 WHEN YOU SEND ME AN JON OSSOFF TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, WE ARE GOING TO SEAL THE DEAL. SO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP THIS MOMENTUM GOING ALL THE WAY TO JANUARY 5. DON'T LET UP FOR ONE DAY. JANUARY 5 IS ELECTION DAYFUL BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WE SHOULD NO LONGER BE TALKING ABOUT ELECTION DAY. THERE'S NO SUCH THING. IT'S ELECTION SEASON. WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL JANUARY 5. ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. ICE STORM IN GEORGIA, YOU KNOW WE'RE IN TROUBLE. SO START VOTING NOW. DURING THIS EARLY VOTING PERIOD THAT GOES THROUGH DECEMBER 31, MAKE VOTING PART OF YOUR HOLIDAY PLAN. DON'T WAIT. THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE. BECAUSE THE FOUR MOST POWERFUL WORDS EVER UTTERED IN A DEMOCRACY ARE, 'THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN.' AND ON NOVEMBER 3, YOU SPOKE LOUD AND CLEAR. AND YOU SENT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS TO THE WHITE HOUSE WITH GEORGIA'S 16 ELECTORAL VOTES. WE KNOW THEY WON, BECAUSE WE COUNTED THEM. HA. AND THEN WE COUNTED THEM AGAIN. AND THEN WE COUNTED THEM AGAIN. CAN THERE BE ANY DOUBT THAT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS ARE THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? BUT THEY WILL NEED HELP. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MOMENT IS ALL ABOUT. THAT YOU WOULD SEND JON OSSOFF AND MYSELF, THAT YOU WOULD GIVE US THE GREAT HONOR OF REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE OF THE GREATEST STATE IN THE UNION, THE STATE OF GEORGIA. THE HOME STATE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. IN WHOSE PULPIT I'M HONORED TO PREACH FROM EVERY SUNDAY AS PASTOR OF EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH, SPIRITUAL HOME OF DR. KING AND THE GREAT JOHN LEWIS WHO WOULD BE TELLING US RIGHT NOW, VOTE LIKE YOU'VE NEVER VOTED BEFORE. AND I'M HONORED JUST TO BE A PART OF THIS EFFORT. I REALLY AM. BECAUSE NO MATTER WHATEVER I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE, I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN WHERE I CAME FROM. I WAS RAISED IN PUBLIC HOUSING. ONE OF 12 CHILDREN IN MY FAMILY, I'M NUMBER 11. 12 KIDS. MY FOLKS ARE PREACHERS AND THEY CLEARLY READ THE BIBLE, BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY. I'M THE FIRST GRADUATE OF A FOUR-YEAR INSTITUTION IN MY FAMILY. MOREHOUSE COLLEGE. I GOT THERE THROUGH HARD WORK, GRIT AND DETERMINATION. BUT I GOT THERE BECAUSE SOMEBODY GAVE ME SOME PELL GRANTS AND SOME LOW-INTEREST STUDENT LOANS. AND I'M RUNNING BECAUSE IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR KIDS GROWING UP IN STRUGGLING FAMILIES THAN IT WAS FOR ME ALL OF THOSE YEARS AGO. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME, YOU SEE AN ITERATION AND AN EXAMPLE OF THE AMERICAN STORY. BECAUSE I GREW UP IN PUBLIC HOUSING. MY MAMA IS FROM WAYCROSS, GEORGIA. THAT'S WAY ACROSS GEORGIA. SHE GREW UP IN THE 1950'S AND AS A BLACK TEENAGER, SHE SPENT MANY SUMMERS PICKING SOMEBODY ELSE'S COTTON. SHE SPENT MANY DAYS PICKING SOMEBODY ELSE'S TOBACCO. BUT THE OTHER DAY, THOSE 82-YEAR-OLD HANDS THAT USED TO PICK SOMEBODY ELSE'S COTTON PICKED HER YOUNGEST SON TO BE OUR NEXT UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA. THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT AMERICA. I LOVE AMERICA BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT COUNTRY THAT GIVES US THE POWER TO MAKE IT GREATER AND THE WAY WE MAKE IT GREATER IS FOR THE PEOPLE TO STAND UP. WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN. THIS IS OUR DEMOCRACY. IT DOESN'T BELONG TO THE POLITICIANS. IT BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE. AT OUR PLEASURE. SO I'M DEEPLY HONORED. THE STAKES OF THIS ELECTION CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. WE'VE GOT TO PASS COVID-19 RELIEF. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS ARE AT THE CENTER OF ANY RELIEF THAT WE PROVIDE. WE'VE GOT TO PROTECT ORDINARY PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS. FOR OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. FOR OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND OUR FIRE MEN AND FIRE WOMEN. WE'VE GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR THOSE WHO PUT IT ALL ON THE LINE FOR US, WHO RISK THEIR LIVES BY SAVING LIVES EVERY DAY. WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS VACCINE DISTRIBUTED SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND OTHER MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES DON'T FIND THEMSELVES AT THE BACK OF THE LINE. WE'VE GOT TO STAND UP FOR OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. ISN'T IT INTERESTING, THE FOLKS THAT WE HAVE TOO OFTEN IGNORED, REFUSED TO PAY A LIVABLE WAGE, THIS PANDEMIC HAS REMINDED US OF HOW IMPORTANT THEY REALLY ARE. THE FOLK WHO STOCK GROCERY STORE SHELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE MANY OF US ARE ASLEEP. THE FOLK WHO KEEP THE ECONOMY HUMMING. WE NOW CALL THEM ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WELL, IF THEY ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND INDEED THEY ARE, WE OUGHT TO PAY THEM AN ESSENTIAL WAGE AND PROVIDE TO THEM ESSENTIAL MEDICINE. IT'S ONLY RIGHT. AND WE HAVE TO STRENGTHEN THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT. AND MAKE SURE WE COVER EVERYBODY. I BELIEVE THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. AND IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON THE PLANET CAN AND OUGHT TO PROVIDE FOR ALL THE CITIZENS. WE CAN DO IT. WE JUST HAVE TO COMMIT TO DOING IT. I'VE BEEN MOVING ALL ACROSS THIS STATE, DROPPING BY LITTLE TOWNS, AND WHEN I GO INTO THESE SMALL, RURAL TOWNS, THEY'RE SURPRISED THAT I'M THERE. I'M SURPRISED THAT THEY'RE SURPRISED. THEY SAY REVEREND, WE'RE NOT USED TO SOMEONE RUNNING FOR THE SENATE COMING BY OUR LITTLE TOWN. THAT'S STRANGE TO ME BECAUSE I'M RUNNING TO BE A UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE WHOLE STATE OF GEORGIA. AND TOO MANY OF OUR RURAL AREAS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED. WE'VE HAD NINE HOSPITALS CLOSE IN THIS STATE IN 10 YEARS BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO EXPEND MEDICAID. , EXPAND MEDICAID. GEORGIA DESERVES A UNITED STATES SENATOR OR TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS WHO BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT, WHO WILL STRENGTHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT INSTEAD OF TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND WHO WILL MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS CAN NEVER BE DENIED COVERAGE FROM HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. GEORGIA DESERVES A UNITED STATES SENATOR WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT WHEN KIDS COME OUT OF SCHOOL, THEY SHOULD NOT BE SO BURDENED WITH COLLEGE DEBT THAT THEY HAVE A MORTGAGE BEFORE THEY HAVE A MORTGAGE. THEN, WE'VE GOT TO INVEST IN THIS COUNTRY THROUGH INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT THAT WILL CREATE BROADBAND IN THESE RURAL AREAS, REPAIR OUR ROADS AND OUR BRIDGES AND OUR BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE OUR BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURE IS A REFLECTION OF OUR BROKEN POLITICS AND WE MUST RISE UP IN THIS DEFINING MOMENT IN AMERICA AND REPAIR ROADS AND BRIDGE, REPAIR OUR DEMOCRACY FOR THE SAKE OF THE PEOPLE. AND WE CAN DO IT. THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS TO STAND TOGETHER. SO PUSH HARD NOW. IN THESE REMAINING COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND PUSH BACK AGAINST THE FORCES THAT TRY TO DIVIDE US. HAVE YOU NOTICED, I'M TRYING TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIVE DEBATE ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, AND MY OPPONENT IS TRYING TO REDUCE THIS RACE TO THE KIND OF EMPTY SCHOOLYARD INSULTS MADE BETWEEN CHILDREN WHO AREN'T THINKING VERY CAREFULLY ON A PLAYGROUND. THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS AND SHE'S BUSY CALLING ME NAMES. I'M TRYING TO HAVE A DEBATE AND SHE'S ENGAGED IN NAME CALLING. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, AS WE SAY IN THE SOUTH, BLESS HER HEART. SHE CAN CALL ME WHATEVER SHE WANTS. HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE. I BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. WE CAN PROVIDE IT IN THE RICHEST NATION ON THE PLANET. I BELIEVE THAT SENIORS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BUYING FOOD AND BUYING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD EVERY DAY DESERVE A LIVABLE WAGE. SHE CAN CALL THAT WHATEVER SHE WANTS. I CALL IT COMMON SENSE. AND SO HERE'S THE THING. I KNOW IT'S DARK BUT WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. WE THE PEOPLE CAN DO IT. THAT IS THE COVENANT WE HAVE WITH ONE ANOTHER AS AN AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE WE? WE ARE THOSE WHO WORK HARD EVERY DAY AND CAN BARELY GET BY. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO WORK HARD BECAUSE WE HAVE HEART, BUT WE DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO WORK TO MAKE OTHERS RICH BUT WE CAN BARELY MAKE THE RENT. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO ARE TRYING TO STRUGGLE AND MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE AND TECHNICAL SCHOOL AND VOCATIONAL SCHOOL SO WE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE GREAT AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO , WE WHO ARE DOING OK ECONOMICALLY. BUT DEEP IN OUR HEART, WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS AMISS. SOMETHING IS WRONG. AND THAT IT NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED. AND WE THE PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO CAN FIX IT IN THIS DEFINING MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. MY DAD USED TO WAKE ME UP EVERY MORNING AS I CLOSE AND NOBODY BELIEVES A BAPTIST PREACHER WHEN HE SAYS 'AS I CLOSE.' THEY SAY HE'S GOT AT LEAST TWO OR THREE MORE CLOSERS. BUT I'M HONESTLY, AS I CLOSE. MY DAD USED TO WAKE ME UP EVERY MORNING BECAUSE HE HAD A SERIOUS WORK ETHIC. HE WAS A VETERAN. LEARNED EARLY TO WAKE UP EARLY AND GET STARTED. HE WAS A PASTOR AND HE WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. HE HAD THINGS TO HANDLE. SO IT DIDN'T MATTER TO HIM WHETHER IT WAS A SCHOOL DAY OR SUMMERTIME. OR SATURDAY. HE WOKE ME UP SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, OFTEN AT DAWN. HE HAD A WAY OF SAYING, SON, GET UP, GET DRESSED, PUT YOUR SHOES ON, GET READY. HE DIDN'T THINK YOU SHOULD SLEEP LATE OR WALK AROUND, YOU KNOW, UNPREPARED. SO HE SAID GET UP, GET DRESSED, PUT YOUR SHOES, GET READY. I WAS A LITTLE BOY AND SO I ASKED HIM, DAD, IT'S SATURDAY. AND YOU KNOW, I'M 7, 10 YEARS OLD. GET READY FOR WHAT? SOMETIMES I'D STOP HIM, HE SAID, I DON'T KNOW, I'LL FIGURE THAT OUT LATER. YOU JUST BE READY. PUT YOUR SHOES ON, SON. HE'D WAKE ME UP AT DAWN. AND THE THING ABOUT DAWN IS THAT IT IS MORNING BUT IT'S STILL DARK. IT'S DARK. BUT MORNING IS ON THE WAY. SO I WANT TO SAY TO YOU COLUMBUS, GEORGIA, I WANT TO SAY TO YOU, AMERICA, THAT I KNOW IT'S DARK BUT MORNING IS ON THE WAY. AND WEEPING MAY ENDURE FOR THE NIGHT BUT JOY COMES IN THE MORNING. ARE YOU READY TO WIN THIS ELECTION? GET UP! GET DRESSED! PUT YOUR SHOES ON! GET READY! CALL EVERYBODY YOU KNOW. TELL THEM IT'S TIME TO VOTE LIKE WE NEVER VOTED BEFORE. GET UP! GET DRESSED! PUT YOUR SHOES ON! GET READY! UNTIL WE HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, UNTIL WE HAVE A LIVABLE WAGE, LET'S FIGHT TOGETHER, LET'S STRUGGLE TOGETHER, LET'S STAY TOGETHER, LET'S PRAY TOGETHER, LET'S MERGE TOGETHER AND TOGETHER WE WIN.

         "Well, thank you, David. Thank you for that kind introduction. Thank you all for the warm welcome. It is good to be with you. To Governor Ducey, to Jay Timmons, to business leaders, distinguished guests: It is my honor and privilege to be back with one of the most remarkable organizations in America that's been leading innovation, creating opportunity, and pursuing progress since 1895: the National Association of Manufacturers. Thank you for having me at this 2019 Board Meeting. (Applause.) And as I get started, I know you've had a busy couple of days, and I wanted, nevertheless, to begin by bringing greetings from a friend of mine , a businessman who now is in a different line of work but I know has made a great connection to all of you in this room and to business leaders around the country. I want to bring you greetings from a man whose leadership has helped bring American manufacturing back. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And I want to also ask you to join me in thanking a great leader in our administration. He's been a champion for manufacturers and hardworking entrepreneurs all across America. I know you've already heard from her at this 2019 Board Meeting, but join me in thanking Linda McMahon, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, for her great work for American jobs and opportunities. Thank you, Linda. (Applause.) We got a lot to talk about today. But before I begin, allow me to address the tragedy that was caused by more than 30 tornadoes that ripped through Alabama, Georgia, and Florida this past Sunday. I know the families of that region are on the hearts of everyone here, as they are on the hearts of every American. We mourn the 23 lives that were lost in Alabama, and our prayers are with the more than 30 people who are still missing, and the families of all of those affected by these terrible storms. At the direction of President Trump, FEMA has already deployed teams to Alabama and Georgia. And I can assure you they will continue to assist state and local search-and-rescue operations until we find and recover all who are missing. Our administration is in constant contact with state and local officials. The President and I have both spoken to Alabama Governor Kay Ivey. The governor has now requested a major disaster declaration, and the President will soon sign it into effect. But to all of those who have been impacted by these tornadoes, let say to each and every one of you, not just on behalf of our administration but on behalf of all of the American people: We are with you. We stand with you. And we will stay with you until you recover bigger and better than ever before. That's our solemn promise. So thank you for that. But today, I'm here simply to say thanks to the great leaders in this room. Thanks to the leaders in the National Association of Manufacturers. It's amazing to think, for more than 120 years, this association has served faithfully as a champion of America's manufacturers in the halls of Washington, D.C. and in state capitols around the country. You have promoted pro-growth, pro-jobs policies that have benefitted American workers and American jobs for generations. And thanks to NAM and your leadership, American manufacturing is back in 2019. (Applause.) It's true. The men and women in this room are not only a testament to the difference that you can make in the public square when you advance free-market principles but you also , you also really personify the American Dream. You represent the success of American manufacturing. And the stories in this room are too numerous to recount from one podium. But let me mention a few, of people like Charles Sukup, the President of Sukup Manufacturing in Sheffield, Iowa. His father, Eugene, founded the company more than a half a century ago with little more than an idea to dry corn a little bit faster. I had the privilege to meet Charles and his family just two years ago. And to you, Charles, and to your family, we want to express our condolences on your father's passing last summer. Today, Charles and his company help feed people around the world as the world's largest family-owned manufacturer of grain bins, dryers, and other farm equipment. In fact, Sukup Manufacturing hired over 200 new workers in 2018 alone. And I think that leadership and that legacy of job creation is worth a round of applause. Thank you, Charles, and thank you to Sukup. (Applause.) We also have with us John Williams, the Chairman and CEO of Jamison Door Company in Hagerstown, Maryland. Jamison Door Company was founded more than a century ago by three men with, I'm told, a little bit of money and a lot of determination. Since then, this family-owned business has produced more than a million doors for homes and businesses all across America. They've grown to more than 120 employees and recently broke ground on a new 50,000-square-foot manufacturing plant. Last year, thanks to the tax relief we'll talk more about in a moment, John Williams and Jamison Door actually was able to offer a raise to every single one of their employees even after they had given two separate bonuses worthy of a week's salary. That's what we call sharing the wealth and growing the American way. (Applause.) Thank you so much to Jamison and to the whole team. It's great. John stood with us in the Rose Garden at the White House last April when the President highlighted the incredible boost those tax cuts have given to manufacturers across the country. And the truth is, for the past two years, business leaders, like Charles and John, and all of you in this room, have been lending your support to advance the agenda the President and I were elected to bring to Washington, D.C. because you knew it would make a difference not just in our companies but in your communities, in your state, in your nation. From tax relief to new trade deals to deregulation, I wanted to come here to say 'thank you.' Thank you for standing with us as we have fought for American jobs and American workers. Because of you, we have unleashed prosperity for the American people and revitalized our nation's great manufacturers. We truly have. And just as we're grateful to each of you , (applause) , and just as we're grateful to each and every one of you for your support, let me assure you that America's manufacturers have no greater champion than President Donald Trump. (Applause.) This is a President whose family lived the American Dream. Came up in a small business of his own , a small family business. Watched his father build an enterprise. He had a bigger dream. He wanted to go across the river and build the big builds on Manhattan Island and eventually build a national and an international name and reputation in construction and hotels and hospitality. But this is a President that understands that a nation grows if a nation builds. He understands that manufacturing is vital to our nation. You, in the room here, build our roads and bridges. You make the cars and trucks that make America run. You forge the planes that travel our skies. You discover and develop life-saving medicines. You deliver affordable energy that powers our homes and businesses. You produce the food that feeds the nation and the world. And when it's all said and done, you make our families stronger, our lives more prosperous, and American manufacturing makes America succeed. (Applause.) You also create good-paying jobs that are really the foundation of the American Dream for millions of our fellow citizens. You know, I come from the state of Indiana where, back when I was governor, I used to say, 'In the Hoosier State, we do two things well: We make things and we grow things.' And I know the strength that manufacturing is in my home state and is in states all across this country. You, actually, at this very moment , manufacturers , employ more than 12 million Americans in all 50 states. And as President Trump wrote , President Trump said when he spoke, rather, to you in our first year in office: The drive and dedication of your workers 'makes this country run,' and their 'creations power our communities and protect our nation.' The truth is, American manufacturing and American manufacturing workers are the backbone of America. It's the truth. (Applause.) And all told, manufacturers contribute more than $2 trillion to our economy, and the overwhelming majority are small businesses. And this President understands the critical role that manufacturers play in the life of our nation. And since day one, as you've observed and partnered with us, we've been fighting to make it easier for you to make the products that make America and easier for the men and women who work on your shop floors to succeed. Since the 2016 election, I'm proud to report to you that, with your strong support for the policies that we've advanced, businesses large and small across this nation have created 5.3 million new jobs. And that includes good-paying manufacturing jobs all across America. (Applause.) You know, it's amazing to think, under the last administration, more than 2,000 manufacturing jobs were lost every single month on average; 210,000 jobs lost to manufacturing over the eight years of the past administration. In fact, the truth is, the last administration all but gave up on manufacturing in America. I'll never forget, at a town hall meeting in 2016 , right after my running mate had promised that we would bring back manufacturing jobs , then President Obama memorably asked, quote, 'What magic wand do you have?' Remember that? He couldn't believe it. He said, quote, 'What exactly are you going to do?' Adding, quote, 'There's no answer to it.' The words of the last President of the United States. But you in this room knew we did have an answer: less government, less taxes, less regulation, and President Donald Trump. And we thank you for your leadership and support. (Applause.) The truth is, in our first year in office, we more than made up for the loss of manufacturing jobs under the last administration. And today, thanks to your hard work and this President's leadership, there have been 480,000 new manufacturing jobs created since Election Day. No magic wand; just commonsense American ideals put into practice. And manufacturing is roaring back. (Applause.) In fact, I'm told 2018 was the best year for manufacturing job creation in more than 20 years. Last year also marked the highest level of optimism among manufacturers ever recorded. Just a few months ago, NAM announced that more than 92 percent of American manufacturers have a positive outlook on the future. And I can just tell looking at all of your faces that that statistic is holding even through today. But, you know, it's not just manufacturing. Under our administration, unemployment has hit a nearly 50-year low. We've seen the lowest unemployment rates on record for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans. And just last week, after the previous administration and countless experts said it couldn't be done, our administration announced that, for the first time in 13 years, we achieved over 3 percent economic growth for an entire calendar year. The American economy is roaring again. (Applause.) Now, this is a testament to all of you who are gathered here , to job creates in businesses large and small all across the country. And it's a testament to all the hardworking Americans that you employ. The truth is, the reforms that we've brought about have meant more money to invest in your business. A growing economy also means more money for your workers and for their families. And one of the most encouraging statistics to the President and me is that after years , years where we saw wages, you know, stubbornly stuck at a modest level of growth, today are rising at the fastest pace in more than 10 years, and they're growing fastest for blue-collar workers, the backbone of the American economy. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. And working Americans are prospering as they haven't done so for more than a decade. (Applause.) And, you know, I don't have to tell you in this room , this hasn't just happened. It's a direct result of the leadership and policies that President Trump and our administration have been advancing and that you've been fighting for , literally fighting for since day one of this administration and throughout the long tenure of this great association. But just look at what we've done in the area of regulation alone. The National Association of Manufacturers actually studied this issue, and I'm told that you found that federal red tape costs manufacturing businesses an astounding $19,500 per employee, per year. And for those of you running small manufacturing firms with fewer than 50 employees, the burden of federal regulation almost doubles to nearly $35,000 per employee, per year. It's amazing. That's why President Trump promised on the campaign trail, and every day since, to roll back the heavy hand of government. And we set a goal at the start of this administration to cut two regulations for every new federal regulation that we put on the books. But we didn't quite hit that mark, because the truth is we blew right past it. In the last year alone, I'm pleased to report to you that thanks to the President's leadership, our administration has cut 12 federal regulations for every new federal rule put on the books. We're cutting federal red tape as never before. (Applause.) In fact, this President has signed more bills cutting federal red tape than any President in American history. And since our election, we've actually delivered more than $33 billion in regulatory savings for working families and business owners. And under President Trump's leadership, we've also been busy unleashing American energy, the lifeblood of our economy, manufacturing, and the entire nation. We withdrew from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord. He approved, early on, the Keystone and Dakota Pipelines. He opened up Alaska National Wildlife Region, one of the largest oil and gas fields in the world. And thanks to these collective actions and the ingenuity of our energy producers, the United States is now the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas. (Applause.) And of course, with the strong support of NAM, before the end of our first year in office, President Trump signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. We cut taxes across the board for working families, family farms, and businesses large and small, and manufacturers just like those gathered here. We slashed the corporate tax rate from the highest in the developed world to below the average. We eliminated the death tax for nearly every American small business owner. And we gave businesses like yours the ability to deduct 100 percent of the cost of your new equipment for the next five years. For decades, jobs and investment poured overseas, but in the past two years, company after company have been making record investments right here in America. Because under this President and this administration, we will always promote and protect what the President calls those four beautiful words: Made in the USA. (Applause.) But with all we've accomplished in these first few years, as this President likes to say, that's just what we call a good start. If you haven't noticed, the American people actually elected a builder to be the 45th President of the United States. And I'm here to tell you that this President and our administration are absolutely committed to rebuilding the infrastructure of America. It is time for a major bill from the Congress to rebuild the roads and bridges and ports and highways of America. (Applause.) As the President said in that State of the Union Address, 'Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure.' And so they should. We're committed to working with the Congress to make historic investments in our infrastructure so that businesses can get your goods to market quicker and more efficiently than ever. You know, I've always said that roads mean jobs. And I don't just mean road jobs. I mean, the truth is, those of you in manufacturing understand that the right infrastructure makes it possible for you to deliver your goods not only across your state, across the nation, but across the world. And we're going to make sure , we're going to make sure that you have the infrastructure to support a growing economy. And to make sure that you can hire the workers you need to keep growing your business and investing in workers, this President is also making it easier than ever for the American people to get the training they need for the manufacturing jobs of the future. Recent studies show nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs are going to be created by businesses like yours in the next decade. But some 2.4 million of those jobs could go unfilled. Seventy percent of manufacturers are already seriously concerned about finding workers. And I hear it all the time, as I travel around the country, about the need for workers and the need for job training and workforce development. The skilled trades in particular, I'm told, are increasingly hard to come by. Electricians, welders, and machinists are in high demand, and too few Americans pursue these valuable paths. You know, the President Trump and I believe that all honest work is honorable. And that's why, in our first year, the President signed an executive order to expand apprenticeships and vocational education to help all Americans adapt to the constantly changing needs of the 21st-century America. We will make sure that we have the best-trained workforce in the world. And we'll work with each and every one of you to accomplish that. (Applause.) But it's not just here at home where we've been fighting for Americans manufacturers. This President has also been busy forging new trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. From Europe to the Indo-Pacific, we're negotiating deals that are built on the principles of free, fair, free, and reciprocal trade. And let me take this moment to thank all the leaders of this great organization for your strong support of our administration last year when the President negotiated and signed a replacement for the outdated NAFTA deal. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement has arrived. (Applause.) The USMCA, as it's known more briefly, is going to impact, we believe, more than 2 million American manufacturing jobs that depend on exports Canada and Mexico. And the USMCA will finally give workers the level playing field that we need to compete and win on a global stage. But now , now that the agreement has been signed and it's going to be considered in the Congress, let me take this opportunity to encourage your renewed energy and support. Governor Ducey and I were just speaking about this a few moments ago, about the importance of us hearing from business leaders and from state officials him, about the importance of swift congressional approval of the USMCA. The truth is, we'd done our jobs. We've negotiated a deal that puts American jobs and American workers first. And it's time for Congress to do theirs. So we urge you to send a strong message to members of Congress in all 50 states that it's time to approve the USMCA, and we must see it approved by Congress this year. (Applause.) While we've been forging new trade deals, we've also been standing up to unfair trade practices where we've encountered them around the world, and that most especially applies to the relationship and the challenges that we face in our economic trading relationship with China. For too long, China has pursued policies that are inconsistent with free and fair trade. And we all know it. As President Trump has said, for years the United States faced, in his word, 'tremendous tariffs' in trading relations with China. In fact, in 2017 alone, Beijing's trade abuses contributed to a $375 billion trade deficit between the United States and China. But as President Trump made clear, those days are over. You know, I'll never forget one of the early meetings, in the first year of our administration, with Chinese officials that came to the Oval Office in the White House. The business leaders in the room would have loved to have been there. You know, this President has a way of negotiating the way you all do over business deals every single day. There's a friendliness about it. There's a cordialness about it. And then there's a directness about it. And I'll never forget when we sat in the Oval Office with the Chinese , one of the Chinese officials that has come over. The President told him, you know, things have to change; that three-, four hundred billion-dollar trade deficits was no longer acceptable. Business as usual had to change. But he started it out by saying, 'Look ' , he looked at them and said, 'Look, you all have done your thing.' And he said, 'That's the past. This is now the future.' He said, 'I'm not looking backwards; I'm looking forwards.' But he did look at this Chinese official , I got to tell you , and he said , he look at him, and he referred to a trade barrier, Governor, that had been erected sometime in the early part of the last decade. And the President looked at him across the Oval Office and he said , he said, 'Well, you all put that trade barrier up.' And he said, 'Yeah, we did.' And he said , and he said, 'Do you mind if I ask you, how did you get away with that?' And the Chinese official looked at him rather shyly and said, 'Nobody ever called.' And the President just said, 'Well, there you have it.' Well, I'm here to tell you, men and women of the National Association of Manufacturing , those days are over. This President is picking up the phone. He is traveling the world. He is fighting for trade deals that are free, and fair, and reciprocal. And we're going to have trade that wins for America and wins for American manufacturers. (Applause.) Now, two weeks ago, I'm pleased to report, a delegation of Chinese officials came to Washington, D.C. to continue our ongoing negotiations. And as the President reported there, that we made substantial progress, most especially on structural issues , things like intellectual property and forced technology transfers. All the kinds of things that have beset American manufacturers seeking to do business in that part of the world. The President said, and we all recognize, that, for the first time, America has put ourselves in a position of strength, having imposed tariffs of some $250 billion. And I can assure you that negotiations are going to continue. The President has actually announced that he's making plans to meet with President Xi in the near future to resolve outstanding issues. And, in fact, we're so encouraged that, because these discussions have been so productive, the President decided to delay an increase in American tariffs that had been scheduled for just a few days ago. But I want to promise each and every one of in this room: President Trump and our administration will continue to stand strong until we establish trade between the United States and China that is free and fair and reciprocal. (Applause.) Finally, as we gather here in Arizona , and I know you're here from all over the country , the people here of Arizona appreciate more than most we have a crisis on our southern border. And this President has stepped forward to provide leadership to address that crisis. And the truth is, despite what you may hear from some of those that opposed the President's border security on Capitol Hill, this is a crisis the likes of which we've never seen before. I mean, for the first time ever, the majority of illegal immigrants coming into our country are unaccompanied minors and families, people who are being exploited by drug cartels and human traffickers to make the long and dangerous journey north through our southern border. And just today, the Department of Homeland Security announced that during this fiscal year to date, Customs and Border Protection has seen a more than 300 percent increase in the number of family units apprehended compared to the year ago. And we saw an incredible rise in the number of large groups who are attempting to cross the border. Two years ago , and the Governor knows these numbers well , two years ago, Border Patrol only encountered two groups of 100 or more individuals. But today, Secretary Nielsen announced that more than 70 large groups have been apprehended, a total of more than 12,000 people. Now, Democrats in Washington say this is a manufactured crisis. But the only thing manufactured is their outrage. Every day we don't secure our border, we allow the crisis to worsen, more lives to be endangered on both sides of the border, and more drugs to flow into our country, and more harm to come to American jobs and American workers. And that's why President Trump has taken such a strong stand for border security. We've already started to build the wall. We've secured some $23 billion for border security funding. And the President used his authority under the law to declare a national emergency on our southern border. Now, some in Congress are trying to stop the President from exercising the authority that Congress gave him to address this very real crisis. So, today, allow me to call on each and every one of you to join us in calling on members of the Senate to support the President's emergency declaration, stand up for border security, and put the safety and security and wellbeing of America first. (Applause.) Now, before I close, know this: In the days, and weeks, and months ahead, we're going to continue working to ensure that our nation's manufacturers grow and thrive, because we know that when you succeed, America succeeds. The stakes could not be higher, and the choice we face could not be clearer. As I said this weekend at another gathering, it is remarkable to think that as we gather here today, leading Democrats are openly advocating an economic system that has impoverished millions around the world. Under the guise of what's called Medicare for All or the Green New Deal, Democrats in Washington, D.C. and in the national debate are embracing the same tired economic theories that impoverished nations and has stifled the liberties of millions over the past century. That system is socialism. What they're actually offering is just more of the same: more taxes, more spending, more government, and less freedom. I've said before; I'll say it again: It was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the most prosperous economy in the history of the world. It was freedom, not socialism, that ended slavery, won two world wars, and stands today as a beacon of hope for all the world. It was freedom, not socialism, that is moving us beyond the prejudices of the past to create a more perfect union and extend the blessings of liberty to every American. It was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the highest quality of life, the cleanest environment on Earth, and improved the health and wellbeing of millions around the world. The truth is, what Medicare for All really means is quality healthcare for none. And the only thing green about the Green New Deal is how much green it's going to cost all of us if they ever actually pass it into law. The truth is, Margaret Thatcher has it right: 'The trouble with Socialism is eventually run out of other people's money.' The truth is, we want to make poor people richer, and they want to make rich people poorer. We want to make poverty more rare, and they want to make poverty more comfortable. I mean, that really is the choice that we face today. For all the progress that we have made over the last two years, as we look at the days ahead and I look at this gathering of extraordinary business leaders and job creators from all across the country, I hope you'll see that choice before us, as well. It is a debate between freedom and socialism; a debate between personal responsibility and government dependence. The President said it well in his State of the Union Address. In his words, 'America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination, and control.' And so, I say, the moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment America ceases to be America. So I say to all the leaders gathered here today, for the sake of our economy and our jobs, for the sake of all the hardworking people that are living the American Dream, working in great companies like yours, or aspiring to work with you and work in your enterprises freedom; for all of those that have a dream and want to live it out; and for the sake of our freedom: Let's say no to socialism. Let's say yes to freedom and prosperity and the pro-growth agenda that we know will make America strong. (Applause.) And I promise you , I promise you the President and I are going to keep fighting , keep fighting for all the things that you've supported over the last two years that have revived American manufacturing and are reviving this economy. But the truth is, it's going to take all of us in the days ahead. So I want to encourage each one of you to do your part. Keep promoting pro-growth policies, pro-jobs policies in Washington, D.C. and all around the country. And promote the policies that you know are going to not only make your company stronger but make our states and our nation stronger. By that I mean talk to your employees. Talk to your workers. Go meet with people in the cafeteria. Talk about the larger issues of the day. Talk about how we've been able to roll back taxes and regulation; how we've been able to fight for free and fair and reciprocal trade in ways that are contributing to their livelihood and the opportunities that they and their family have. Tell them how we've been rolling back the heavy hand of government so that your company can innovate, give them job security, and create more opportunities for more people in the community in the years ahead. I mean, tell them how we're putting Washington, D.C. back to work for them. And tell them that we're going to keep fighting for each and every one of them. Talk to your suppliers as well. Talk to your business associates. Send out an email. I mean, the truth of the matter is, those of us who serve in public office , whether it be the President, whether it be the Governor, whether it be Linda McMahon, or this Vice President , we can only do so much. You're the leaders in your communities and your state and all across this nation. And we want to encourage you today to let your voice be heard. On all these major issues, just know that sending an editorial to your local paper, sitting down for a local interview, talking to your employees, or speaking at a local Rotary Club makes the difference all across this country. And we encourage you to let your voice be heard. And I truly do believe that with your continued support, with President Donald Trump in the White House, with support all across this country for policies that are making American manufacturing and American economy strong, and with God's help, we will make this country more prosperous than we could ever possibly imagine. We will make this country safer than it's ever been before. And to borrow a phrase, we will make America great again. Thank you all very much. God bless you. (Applause.) And God bless the United States of America. It's an honor to be with you.",

         "Thank you, Madam Secretary, and thank you for your great leadership. You all may be seated. To the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Schultz, Vice Admiral Buschman, Director Padilla, Director Ayala, and to all of you serving in the uniform of the United States of America at every level, all of you who serve and protect the people of this nation: It is my honor to be here with all of you at Coast Guard Base Portsmouth. Thank you for your service. (Applause.) It is amazing to think, as we reflected earlier today on the work of the joint task force , it's amazing to think of all the different agencies and all the different courageous service that's represented here, and the difference that each and every one of you make. The Department of Homeland Security: Some 240,000 men and women who work each and every day to protect the homeland, to protect American families, to protect our cities, and to protect the nation against the scourge of drug addiction, the impact of criminal syndicates. So as I begin my remarks today, let me bring a word of gratitude, admiration, and appreciation from your Commander-in-Chief. I bring the thanks of the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The President asked me to be here today to hear the latest on the efforts of the joint task force, but also just to express a word of appreciation to each and every one of you and, to no less extent, your families for the service that you render to the people of this country each and every day. I hope some of you had a chance to see the State of the Union Address last night. The President of the United States addressed the nation. He laid out a bold, bipartisan vision and called on the Congress to join the American people, to join each and every one of you, to choose greatness. But it is something I know each and every one of you do every day. The President called for unity in Washington. He asked members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, to come together to 'build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock,' in his words, 'the extraordinary promise of America's future.' And as the President said in his State of the Union , and I say with equal conviction, looking out at all of your shining faces and thinking of all that you represent here, across this department, across this country , indeed, the state of our union is strong and it is safer because of the work that all of you do every day. And the American people know it. Give yourselves another round of applause. (Applause.) And we know that your service comes with sacrifice for you and your families. And, frankly, your character shines through each and every day through deployments, through missions that you undertake. And the nation, frankly, saw your character in high relief in recent weeks when the President took a strong stand for border security during the government shutdown that lasted some 35 days. Let me say to each and every one of you: The President and I couldn't more grateful or couldn't be more proud of all our federal employees and their families who rose to the challenge, stayed on task. But we are especially grateful to the men and women of the Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security. You stood tall, you stood your watch, you did not relent. And you have our thanks for your commitment to your mission and your duty. Thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you for standing your post. And just know this President and I, and our entire administration, have your back. And even as we speak today, the Congress is working on funding not only for the Coast Guard, for the Department of Homeland Security, but for other critical agencies of the government. And we're working in good faith to resolve these issues. But I promise each and every one of you, just as you stand and fight every day for the safety and security of the American people, President Donald Trump and I are going to stand and fight to get you what you need to accomplish your mission and keep the American people safe. That's our promise. (Applause.) We recognize, and I just heard in my briefing, your job is more challenging because our border is not secure along the southern border of the United States. A porous border along the United States gives drug traffickers and criminal cartels too many opportunities. And the traffic that the Coast Guard, the traffic that the joint task force interdicts all across the east coast through the Gulf of Mexico, and along the southern border of this country, is reflective of that reality. Enforcing our laws and protecting the American people is what all of you do best. And I just want to assure you, as evidenced in the President's words last night, as evidenced in the determination that he and our administration has reflected, we're going to continue to fight to get you what you need to accomplish that mission. And we are going to secure our border one way or another. (Applause.) Now, it is impressive to learn, Admiral, about this joint task force and to think about the interagency efforts. It really is remarkable to think about it. Joint Task Force-East, and West, and Investigations, do an extraordinary job leading a coalition of partners from across DHS, Coast Guard, Customs, Border Protection, Immigrations Customs Enforcement, U.S. Citizenship, Immigration Services, ICE. And of course, let's not forget, our great partners in local law enforcement who work with all of our federal agencies every single day. We respect and appreciate them as well. (Applause.) You also work hand-in-hand with the Department of Defense and our international partners to advance the security and prosperity here at home and, frankly, all across the Western Hemisphere. I just heard a briefing on our investigations division, and learned about how we have, literally, forward deployed to deal with those who would threaten our families and threaten our communities long before they're ever anywhere close to the border of the United States of America. And those international partnerships are vital to our efforts. The work you do every day saves lives, and it's remarkable to think about that. And I hope each and every one of you understands that the American people know it, from your Commander-in-Chief on down: The work that each and every one of you does every day stems the tide of narcotics that comes into this country that literally claims the lives of tens of thousands of Americans. We cannot account for the lives that are saved, but we know they are many. We think of the great news yesterday. I was just informed that the Coast Guard Cutter Forward, a sister ship of the Bear that I was just on, homeported here in Portsmouth. It literally offloaded more than 15 tons of cocaine that had been seized over the past two months during counter-narcotics operations in the Eastern Pacific. Join me in thanking the whole crew of the Forward for a job well done that is saving American lives. (Applause.) The truth of the matter is, none of you in this room have to wonder whether you make a difference, because you do, every single day. And I want tell you, as I travel all across this country, I hear about the admiration of all of the agencies represented here. I hear the expressions of support, and I expect very recently you heard it as well, from communities and families that reached out to yours and just took the opportunity to let you know how grateful they are to each and every one of you. And I can assure you that is the , that is a reflection of the view of all of the American people. You know, I was on Capitol Hill on September 11, 2001. We didn't even have a Department of Homeland Security then. I'll never forget seeing the smoke rise from the Pentagon. And I'll never forget when we traveled to Ground Zero a week later, and saw the unspeakable devastation of the evil that had descended there. You, in a very real sense , all the agencies here, now under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security and the capable leadership of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen , you're all a part of an American response that keeps our nation safe, that leans into the fight against those who would harm our families, who would seek to profit through narcotics, who would enslave people through human trafficking and the brutality that's represented there, and also who would seek to come into our country with criminal intent or terrorist intent. You make a difference every day. And I want you to know that we all know it, and we're grateful to each and every one of you. And I want to promise you, for all that you do every single day, President Donald Trump and our administration will always have your back. Our record, I hope, speaks for itself. Within a month in office, the President signed an executive order to strengthen the authority of DHS, the Coast Guard, and law enforcement at every level to combat transnational criminal organizations, and cartels, and gangs that threaten the American people and are constantly changing in their methods. Last August, the President signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act, updated the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act to make it easier for all of you and all those serving on the frontlines of law enforcement to bring maritime smugglers to justice. And we're grateful for the support in Congress that made that possible. And, of course, since the first day of this administration, President Donald Trump has worked to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. In our first year in office, the President signed into law the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the largest military pay raise in nearly 10 years. (Applause.) And as the Commandant knows, there was more than $12 billion for the Coast Guard to rebuild your aging fleets and strengthen the vital assets of your mission. So congratulations to you all. (Applause.) So we've made incredible progress in the last two years, but the truth is, as I said before, we recognize that your jobs and all the agencies represented so well here , your jobs are as difficult and dangerous as ever, largely driven by the security and humanitarian crisis along the southern border of the United States. And we do have a crisis on our southern border. It's extraordinary to think that, every single day, some 2,000 people attempt to come into this country illegally. And those are just the people that are apprehended by agencies and Border Patrol so well represented here. Two thousand people a day coming into the United States of America. It's a security crisis. Last year alone, some 10,000 individuals with prior criminal convictions were apprehended attempting to come into the United States of America. But's it's also a humanitarian crisis. I don't need to tell all of you with responsibilities along our southern border, gathered here in this room, that for the first time ever, the majority of people seeking to come into our country illegally are families and unaccompanied minors , putting an enormous burden on our system. And it's a reflection of human traffickers and cartels that I learned today charge upwards of $5,000 per person to entice vulnerable families to take the long and dangerous journey up the peninsula , a journey that, for most, results in physical and sexual abuse along the way. And for some, even worse. We have cartels and human trafficking organizations , criminal syndicates , that take advantage of vulnerable families and take advantage of loopholes in our laws and our porous borders. And as the President of the United States said last night, 'This is a moral issue.' We have a moral duty to secure our border and reform the immigration laws of the United States of America. And we will do it. (Applause.) And the cost , the cost, you all know, is extraordinary. Every day our southern border remains unsecured gives criminal syndicates and drug traffickers and human traffickers another opportunity to threaten our families and harm people on both sides of the border. The men and women of the Coast Guard and DHS know firsthand about these transnational criminal organizations in Mexico and Central America , the drug cartels that fuel their deadly trade. They represent one of the greatest national-security and public-health threats in the history of this country. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of death for adults under 55 years of age. In 2016, across America, 174 people lost their lives to drug overdose every single day. The illicit drug trade not only claims the lives of tens of thousands of Americans, it also strengthens; it strengthens the ability of those criminal syndicates in the world that engage in their heinous activities, from extortion to human trafficking, and worse. The challenges and threats that you personally face in the line of duty underscore the reason why we are so determined to give you the resources that you need to secure our border and protect this homeland. And we will do it. President Trump, as he described last night, has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border. It's really an all-of-the-above plan. It's a plan that includes humanitarian assistance; more law enforcement personnel; drug detection technology at our ports of entry; closing loopholes that enable child smuggling; and a proposal for a new physical barrier. As the President said last night: A smart steel barrier on our southern border. Walls work, and we need to secure our border, including with a physical barrier. And we will do it one way or another. We're going to secure our border. That's our promise to each and every one of you. And we're going to support each one of you in the efforts that you make on behalf of the American people. In the days ahead, you can be confident that just as each and every one of you step forward to protect this nation every day, to stand up for the American people, we're going to continue to stand with you to give you the resources and the support that you need. So thank you all for coming out today. It's a great honorto meet you. I hope to get a chance to say hello to as many of you as possible in person. It's the greatest honor of my life to serve as your Vice President, and I thank you for coming and spending a few minutes with me today in the midst of all of your duties. So I came here to say: We're with you. We're going to stand with you. We're going to continue to fight to give you the resources that you need to protect the homeland and secure our border. But as I said before, I also came here just to say thanks. The Good Book says, if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. Let me assure each and every one of you, the American people honor your service. We respect the way you've answered the call for this country. I was sitting down in the Mess Hall of the Bear just a few minutes ago. And one of those Coast Guardsmen , I looked across at him and I asked him, 'Why did you join the Coast Guard?' He'd been in about 12 years. Talked about how he remembered 9/11. He just wanted to do something for his country and to protect his country. And I think what's remarkable about that answer is it's very typical of, I know, how all of you feel. Public service is a calling. Public safety is a calling. It's a calling to a mission to consider others as more important than yourself; to count your life as less important than the lives of your countrymen. And so, I really came here to say thank you. I came here to say thank you. Thank you to each and every one of you for your service. Thank you for what you do to keep the American people safe each and every day. And just know that while you have our thanks, you have our support, I'm also confident that you do have the prayers of millions of Americans. So I'll close with that prayer as well, that 'no harm will overtake you no disaster will come near and He guard you in all your ways,' as you guard the people of the United States of America. So thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. (Applause.)",

         "Uh, Alicia Keys. Honestly, I just want to say something. Alicia Keys. I've known her for a long time, and the thing is that she is she has a gift. We all know that she has a gift. She has an incredible voice. She is a just such an incredible talent as a musician, as a writer. And she always, on top of all of that, shows up and shows up for our country, shows up on issues and does it with incredible courage, but always truth speaking. And we have to applaud an artist with the gift that she has, who does it all and does it all always with grace and with conviction. Can we again give it up for Alicia Keys? Can you hook for Alicia Keys? Well, it is so good to be in Phoenix. What's up, Phoenix? It's so good to be here. It's so good to be back. I was just here. Actually, Joe and I came to Phoenix the day after that debate I had with Mike Pence. So it's good to be back in Phoenix. And I wanna thank Ruben Gallego, the most incredible congressman. He is a friend. He is a leader for Arizona. He is a national leader. Please give it up for Ruben Gallego and Congressman Greg Stanton again, a great leader who was a leader always fighting for the people of the state he rolled to Borini. She is going to get this done. Candidate for Arizona. Six. Phoenix mayor can't Diego. Thank you. What a powerhouse! So it's This is a good time. This is a good time. Six days to go. And like Alicia said, we are here joyful, knowing what is at stake and we understand than in fighting for all of the issues that will be determined based on the outcome of this election, we can work hard while still enjoying some good music, dancing a good dance bop in our head, knowing that with joy and optimism, we fight for the things we believe in. This is not a fight against anything. This is a joyful fight for what we know can be unburdened by what has been. That's what's before us. That is what is before us, Phoenix And I'll tell you in the in the spirit of the late, great John McCain, I'm here to also engage in a little straight talk because I'll tell you, you know, for example, you know there's been there's been a lot of talk from the current occupant of the White House about my values. Well, let me just tell you, in the spirit of John McCain, I am a proud, patriotic American. It was very clear thinking about the values we as Americans share when it comes to knowing that the commander in chief of the United States of America should have as his first priority the health and well being of the American people. I am clear in understanding. This is the greatest failure of any presidential administration we have ever witnessed as a country. And I know that we are all prepared to stand for the democracy of our country and to stand for this country we love, and the challenges are there great. We are facing right now probably four crises that have converged at one time because of this pandemic, we're looking at a public health crisis. That is what I've been calling one of the greatest mass casualty events we have experienced designation since World War two. We're looking at over 225,000 people who have died in just the last several months, many of whom, because of the nature of this pandemic, were with out their family members for their last minutes and hours on this earth. We're looking at a public health crisis where a virus has infected over 8.5 million Americans who are going to face unknown long term health consequences, including what? Including what doctors are telling us lung scarring and things of that nature. And I bring this up and these numbers up because I think it is really important for us to understand it didn't have to be this bad. It did not have to be this bad, thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward. We know that the president of the United States and the vice president of the United States were informed about the nature of this pandemic. Back on January 28th. They were informed that it was five times as lethal as deadly as the flu. They were informed it could hurt people of every age. They were in formed that it was airborne. But what did they do with this information? They sat on it. They covered it up. They did not tell the American people. Instead, the president of the United States said it was a hoax. And then most recently, just in the last couple of days at the gall to say We're rounding the corner on it. But Phoenix, can you imagine what you would have done if you had known on January 28th? How serious this was, What you as a parent, what you is a working person? What you is a small business owner or someone who works for a small business. You was a teacher what you might have done if you had known on January 28th, you know, because even before this pandemic, you know, Donald Trump was walking around talking about how the economy is great. The economy is great, right? But the fact is that in America, even before the pandemic, far too many families had to work two and three jobs to put food on the table and pay the rent. And let me just tell you something in Joe Biden and my American, nobody should have to work more than one job to pay the rent and put food on the table. Even before this, we were looking at the fact that the average American family had less than $1000 in savings. But how people would have prepared shoot how people would have bought a little bit more toilet paper. Have we known what this was all gonna be and Lysol. But I make light of it because the reality is they knew and they did not tell the people because they put politics in front off the priorities of the American people. And so we are now in this public health pandemic, but it is even worse than them covering it up. You do know that the president of the United States with his boy Bill bar, are in the United States Supreme Court right now, suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act in the midst of a pandemic. The Affordable Care Act, which was brought tow us by President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden and brought health care to over 20 million people who did not have it protected people with preexisting conditions so that they could not be denied coverage based on a preexisting condition. Honk. If you know somebody who has diabetes, honk if you love somebody who has high blood pressure honk. If you know some body with breast cancer honk, if you know somebody with Lupus with all right and they're trying to get rid of it, you know, in part of it, I just have to say, You know, even when he was running for office, it was clear that the man just had this very weird obsession with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. And this is just a extension of that. But here's the thing. Phoenix We don't really want presidents who have weird obsessions, do we? No, Joe Biden is saying. Instead of trying to get rid of the Affordable Care act, Joe and I are saying no, let's expand coverage. Let's expand coverage understanding. We need to bring down Medicare eligibility to age 60. Let's expand coverage in terms of bringing down the cost of prescription drugs bringing down the cost of premiums. Let's expand coverage understanding. When we're talking about health care, the body just just start from the neck down. It is also the neck up , and we need to have mental health care available for everyone who needs it. There is a clear contrast, a clear choice in this election about where we go from here, a public health crisis and economic crisis. We are looking at an economic crisis that is being compared to the Great Depression. Over 30 million Americans in just the last several months filed for unemployment insurance. Here in Arizona, one out of 10 families is describing their household is having been hungry. We're not talking enough about that. I've seen numbers that one in five mothers is describing her Children. Under the age of 12. We are in the midst of, ah, hunger crisis in America. Here in Arizona, one in nine families could not pay their rent. Are are worried about being able to pay their rent next month. Here in Arizona, one in four small businesses have gone out of business, and there is a clear contrast because on the one hand you have Joe Biden who, when asked, How do you think the economy is doing? Joe Biden will say, Well, tell me how working people are doing. Tell me how working families are doing Joe Biden, who says You want to talk to me about the economy? Then let's talk about what we need to do because we are not going to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year, we are going to increase middle class tax cuts. We are going to ensure that families working families do not pay more than 7% of their income in child care. We know that the path Thio intergenerational wealth with so many families includes homeownership. So first time home buyers will get a $15,000 tax credit for a down payment and closing costs. That's how Joe thinks about the economy. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who, when asked, How's the economy doing? You know what he says almost every time. Well, how's the stock market doing? How are rich people doing? Which is why one of his first orders of business was to pass a tax cut benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America, to the point that we will be faced with a $2 trillion deficit. Well, let me tell you, if we do what we need to do in these next six days, Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut on invest that money in working families. Invest that money in building up our infrastructure, building back up our roads and bridges, building back up what we need to do around renewable energies. And that's gonna be about millions of jobs because we know when you invest in the American worker in American families, we as an economy will always do well, no, there's a clear choice in this election. The crises that we are confronting include a long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. And you have Joe Biden, who is informed about America's history and has the courage to speak truth and say the phrase black lives matter that Joe Biden who understands it, may be difficult to hear. But we've got to confront racial disparities in America in our health care system, in our economy, in our education systems, Joe says. We need to deal with small businesses so many minority and women owned small businesses who have gone out of business. And so we will invest $150 billion in low interest loans and access to capital for those businesses. Joe knows we need to deal with the criminal justice system. It must be reformed and do that and do it in a way that is about getting rid of private prisons. Getting rid of cash bail, which is an economic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue decriminalizing marijuana expunging expunging the records of people who have been convicted for marijuana offenses. Joe Biden knows we have to deal with policing, and we have to hold anybody accountable who breaks the law. And so we will put in place a ban on chokeholds and carotid holds. George Floyd would be alive today if that were the case. We will say there needs to be a national registry for police officers who break the law because you can't just do it in one place and then get fired and move to another place and get hired. That's not right. Joe Biden has the courage to speak these truths in a way that is about bringing folks together and fixing the problems we know exist. On the other hand, you have the current president of the United States who went on a debate stage debate before last, refused to condemn white supremacists and then double down, saying, Stand back and stand by and be clear. This is a pattern. This is the fellow who ran for office partly on a campaign theory to suggest that the first black president of the United States was an illegitimate president of the United States. This is the same person. There's a pattern here. Phoenix who on the on the tragedy of what happened in Charlottesville remember that people were peacefully protesting racial injustice. There was a young woman who was killed in that protest. And on the other side there were neo Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying tiki torches, hurling racial and anti Semitic slurs and the commander in chief. So there were fine people on both sides, a person who came into office calling Mexicans rapists and criminals. A person who came in the office in one of his first orders of business was institute a Muslim ban. We deserve so much more. Let me tell you, Joe, in his heart in his soul, is running, knowing that we must bring our country together and give dignity to all people. Joe knows it is time to End this this attempt to spew hate and division among us. It is time to end trying to get Americans to turn on each other. Joe knows the real sign of someone's strength is not based on who you beat down. It's based on who you lift up. They're really, really choices in this election. Let's deal with something that all of us on the West Coast and in this area of the world understand quite well. And it is that we are in the midst of a crisis in terms of our climate, and it poses a threat. To us as a species and we must acknowledge the science and deal with it. You've got Joe who says I see what's happening. I see that you have the West Coast, my home state of California, Oregon. Washington called all the fires, the wildfires, devastating entire communities or having to be evacuated. I have met with families that have been evacuated. I have met with firefighters who are fighting fires while their own homes are burning. My brother in law is a firefighter, the devastation is profound. You go to the Gulf Coast states. In fact, right now what is it? Zeta is hitting Louisiana. It's the fifth named storm this year, I say, named be cause they don't name a small storm. It's serious what it's doing in terms of hurting the livelihood and well being of families in the Midwest floods, to the point that farmers in that area of our country have lost a whole season of crops. We have to take this seriously, Joe says. We have to deal with the science, but we have to see the opportunity, and the crisis is, well, one. The clock is ticking on this, and we need to act with a sense of urgency and put in place goals like Net zero emissions by 2050. We need to understand that we have to have ah, protection of land and open spaces. We need to understand that an investment in renewable energies is also about an investment in jobs and investment in the apprenticeship programs of our building trades and the carpenters and plumbers and the electrician's don't understands what leadership looks like on this. On the other hand, you have the current president of the United States who went approached by journalists and that the journalist said something like, You know, these wildfires that happened in California And the scientists are saying, You know, that the science tells us that these extreme weather conditions are a very big factor and what's going on? And do you know that the president of the United States of America responded? The commander in chief of the United States of America, He's supposed to be a worldwide leader, responded when asking that when being asked that question. Science doesn't know as though science is a person. Well, Mr President, science does know. it is time we take this issue seriously. So, yeah, so the stakes are high, The stakes are high. Phoenix and you in this state. The reason I'm here, the reason I was here with Joe last time I was in Tucson earlier today. The reason I'm here is to thank you, because I do believe you all are going to make a real statement about who we truly are as a country. Arizona has a well earned reputation for wanting truth talkers. Straight talkers. Arizona has a long standing reputation for no Bs just get the job done. Arizona understands that. Come to me, talk ing about issues that are the issues I deal with. They keep me up in the middle of the night that have me sitting at my kitchen table trying to figure it all out. That's what Arizona demands off its leaders. And in this election, that is what is at stake. Joe and I are very proud of the fact that in this campaign we have built one of the broadest coalitions you've ever seen. We' ve got, of course, Democrats. But we've got Republicans. Cindy McCain, Jeff Flake, Independence Peope of all back grounds coming together, understanding what is at stake. And the issues are yes, the four things we've already talked about it so much more. It's about putting. It's about putting Resources into our public education system. We will triple teachers Title one funding. It's about fighting for civil rights, including LGBTQ Rights. It is about immediately putting a pathway to citizenship and renewing protections for our dreamers under DACA. There is so much at stake. And I do believe because of who you are, you will make a difference not only in terms of who wins, but you will make a difference in terms of saying who we are. And so here's the thing you know people, then ask well, I don't know if I should vote or doesn't matter. Why should I vote? People ask these questions often, right? I'm sure all of us have been asked the question. I think there are three reasons people should vote. One is to honor the ancestors honor the ancestors. You know, this year we lost a great American hero. Congressman John Lewis. John Lewis shed his blood fighting good trouble. Shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the right for folks to vote right for the right for black Americans to vote. When black Americans were being denied the right to vote, John Lewis understood that was a civil rights issue. That was an issue about a statement of who we are as a country. Which is why, and John Lewis's life. He also was one of the first in line to fight for marriage equality. Why John Lewis was one of the first in line to fight for immigrant rights because he understood this is about civil rights, and he paid a price for that by shedding his blood. So let's honor the ancestors. Let's honor the ancestors. When we just this year celebrated the 1/100 anniversary of the 19th Amendment, let's honor those suffragettes who in their white marched and shouted and fought and dared any one to tell them they were less than equal. And let's also speaking truth. Remember history that black women, how ever, were not allowed to vote until 1965. But let's honor the ancestors understanding it is our responsibility. To take on what they fought for us to have as a right and to follow through with that Number two. Let' s vote. Because of everything we have discussed, that is at stake. There was so much that impacts us every day that is at stake in this election. And here's my third point about voting. You know , I'm traveling the country. I've been in Georgia, Been in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio. Um, I've been everywhere. I' m gonna be going to Texas. Um, so you know, in 2013 the United States Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act. Right? Okay. It's called Shelby V. Holder. They took out the ability of the Justice Department to enforce the need for fair voting laws, and immediately thereafter in 2013 almost two dozen states put in place laws that were designed to make it difficult for folks to vote. They purged the rolls in and and they focused on black voters, voters of color students, our indigenous brothers and sisters, right? And so much so that in North Carolina, a court of appeal reviewed the case and said that they passed a law with quote surgical precision to prevent black people from voting. That's how bad it's been. Not to mention the president, United States, that that first debate got up on a stage in front of 70 million Americans and in my opinion, openly encouraged a suppression of the vote and all of the states that are trying to make it confusing. I mean, states where you gotta fill out the ballot and put it in one envelope, and then you're supposed to put on another envelope. In some states where you gotta have been a third person, sign the envelope, you know, States that air picking up the drop boxes so that people can't find it easy to drop off their ballots states that air closing down polling places, the messing with the post off the post office, the post office postal workers are like the best, nicest people you could ever meet. They're messing with the post office. And so you gotta ask, Why are so many powerful people trying to make it so confusing and difficult for us to vote? And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. And so let us not let anyone ever take our power from us. Let us use the power of our voice at election time through our vote because the power is with the people. And you know, when people say, Well, what do you think about what's gonna happen the day after the election? Here's what I say. America's democracy is always going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. So my last point is this. This moment will pass, and years from now, our Children, our grandchildren and others they're gonna look in our eyes. Each one of us and they will ask us. Where were you that moment And what we are all going to be able to tell them? It's so much more than just how we felt. We will tell them what we did way will tell them what we did. We will tell them we organized folks. We help people get to the polls. We reminded people to vote early. We texted and we called. And we emailed to the point that people got sick of us. But we knew they get over it. We did everything that was necessary to remind each other that we are not alone, that we are in this together, that we each have the power and that we love our country and are prepared to fight for its ideals. And we will tell them we elected Joe Biden, president of the United States. Thank you, Phoenix.",

         "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by President-elect Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware Good afternoon. Today I am pleased to announce the team that will lead my Administration's ambitious plan to address an existential threat of our time , climate change. Like their fellow-Cabinet nominees and appointments, members of our environment and energy team are brilliant, qualified and tested, and barrier-busting. With today's announcements there will be six African American members of our Cabinet. A record. After today, our Cabinet won't just have one or two precedent-breaking appointments, but 12 , including today's long-overdue appointment of the first Native American Cabinet Secretary. Already there are more people of color in this Cabinet than any Cabinet ever. More women than ever. The Biden-Harris Cabinet will be an historic Cabinet. A Cabinet that looks like America. That taps into the best of America. That opens doors and includes the full range of talents we have in this nation. And like the rest of the team, today's nominees are ready on Day One, which is essential because we literally have no time to lose. Just this year, wildfires burned more than 5 million acres in California, Washington, and across the West , an area roughly the size of the entire state of New Jersey. Intense and powerful hurricanes and tropical storms pummeled Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, and across the Gulf and along the East Coast. Record floods, hurricane-speed windstorms, and severe droughts ravaged the Midwest. And more Americans see and feel the devastation in big cities and small towns, on coastlines and farmlands, in red states and blue states. Billions of dollars in damage. Homes and memories washed away. Small businesses closed up for good. Crops and farmlands destroyed for the next generation family farmer. Just last year, the Defense Department reported that climate change is a direct threat to more than two-thirds of the military's operationally critical installations. And this could well be a conservative estimate. And so many climate and health calamities are colliding at once. It's not just a pandemic that keeps people inside , it's poor air quality. Multiple studies have shown air pollution is associated with an increased risk of death from Covid-19. Folks, we're in a crisis. Just like we need a unified national response to COVID-19, we need a unified national response to climate change. We need to meet this moment with the urgency it demands as we would during any national emergency. And from the crisis, we need to seize the opportunity to build back better than we were before.That's what this Administration will do. When we think about climate change, we think 'jobs.' Good-paying union jobs. A key plank of our Build Back Better economic plan is building a modern, climate-resilient infrastructure and clean energy future. We can put millions of Americans to work modernizing water, transportation, and energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme weather. When we think about renewable energy, we see American manufacturing, American workers, racing to lead the global market. We see farmers making American agriculture first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions and gaining new sources of income in the process. We see the small businesses and master electricians designing and installing innovative, energy-conserving buildings and homes. This will reduce electricity consumption and save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs. And we will challenge everyone to step up. We will bring America back into the Paris Agreement and put us back in the business of leading the world on climate change. The current Administration reversed the Obama-Biden fuel-efficiency standards and picked Big Oil companies over the American workers. Our Administration will not only bring those standards back , we will set new, ambitious ones that our workers are ready to meet. We see American workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations across the country. We see American consumers switching to electric vehicles through rebates and incentives. Not only that , the federal government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles. And we're going to harness the purchasing power of our federal government to make sure we are buying clean, electric vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in America. All together, this will mean one million new jobs in the American auto industry. And we'll do another big thing: put us on a path of achieving a carbon-pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 that no future president can turn back. Transforming the American electricity sector to produce power without carbon pollution will be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st Century, not to mention the benefits to our health and our environment. But we need to get to work right away. We'll need scientists at national labs, land-grant universities, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities to innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean electricity. We'll need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them. We'll need ironworkers and welders to install them. That's how we'll become the world's largest exporter of these technologies, creating even more jobs. We know how to do this. The Obama-Biden Administration rescued the auto industry and helped them retool. We made solar energy cost-competitive with traditional energy and weatherized more than a million homes. The Recovery Act made record clean energy investments , $90 Billion , on everything from smart grid systems to clean energy manufacturing. We will do it again , bigger, and faster, and better than before. We'll also build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that will benefit our communities three-times over by alleviating the affordable housing crisis, by increasing energy efficiency, and by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to homeownership. We'll create more than a quarter-million jobs right away, to do things like working toward plugging the 3.2 million abandoned oil and gas wells that the EPA says pose an ongoing threat to the health and safety of our communities. We'll launch a new, modern-day Civilian Climate Corps to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. And I believe that every American has a fundamental right to breathe clean air and drink clean water. But I know that we haven't fulfilled that right. No, we haven't fulfilled that right for a generation or more in places like Cancer Alley in Louisiana or along the Route 9 corridor right here in Delaware. Fulfilling this basic obligation to all Americans, especially in low-income white, Black, Brown, and Native American communities who too often don't have clean air and clean water is not going to be easy. But it is necessary. And we are committed to facing climate change by delivering environmental justice. These aren't pie-in-the-sky dreams. These are concrete, actionable solutions. And this team will get them done. For Secretary of the Interior, I nominate Congresswoman Deb Haaland. She's of the Pueblo people. A 35th-generation New Mexican. She's from a military family. Her mom, also Pueblo, served in the United States Navy. Her dad, Norwegian American, a Marine now buried in Arlington. A single mom, she raised her child while running a small business. When times were tough, they relied on food stamps. Congresswoman Haaland graduated from law school and got involved in politics. Two years ago, she became one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress. She serves on the Armed Services Committee, and Committee on Natural Resources, and Chairs the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands, where she's earned the respectof a broad coalition of people , from tribal leaders to environmental groups to labor. As the first Native American Cabinet Secretary in the history of the United States of America, she will be a true steward of our national parks, natural resources, and all of our lands. The federal government has long broken promises to Native American tribes who have been on this land since time immemorial. With her appointment, Congresswoman Haaland will help me strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship, and I am honored she accepted this critical role. For Secretary of Energy, I nominate Jennifer Granholm. The first woman to ever serve as Governor of Michigan. In 2009, she faced the collapse of a defining industry of her state and our nation. But I saw firsthand how she responded. She bet on the autoworkers. She bet on the promise of a clean energy future. Her leadership helped rescue the American auto industry, helped save one million American jobs, and helped bring Detroit back. Governor Granholm is just like the state she led so effectively for eight years: hard-working, resilient, and forward-thinking. Someone not only capable of solving urgent problems, but someone who sees the opportunities of the future always with her eyes on the needs and aspirations of working people. Throughout her career, she's worked with states, cities, business, and labor to promote a clean energy future with new jobs, new industries, cleaner and more affordable energy. Now, I'm asking her to bring that vision and faith in America to the Department of Energy. For Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, I nominate Michael Regan. A proud son of North Carolina, he turned a passion for exploring the woods and waters of the Inner Coastal Plain into a deep expertise in environmental science. He got his start at the EPA serving in both Democratic and Republican Administrations, working on everything from reducing air pollution to improving energy efficiency. He currently serves as Secretary of North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality,where he's brought people together across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to help build a new clean energy economy, creating quality jobs, and confronting climate change. He led the charge to clean up the Cape Fear River, contaminated for years by dangerous toxic chemicals. And he created North Carolina's first board of its kind to address environmental justice and equity. It helps lift up frontline and fenceline communities who had carried the burdens of industrial progress for too long, without sharing in the benefits. Michael would be the second African American official and first African American man to serve in this position. He shares my belief in forging consensus and finding common purpose. He is the leader who will reassert the EPA's place as the world's premier environmental protection agency that safeguards our planet, protects our lives, and strengthens our economy for all Americans. For Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, I nominate Brenda Mallory. An accomplished public servant. A brilliant environmental lawyer. A daughter of a working-class family who has dedicated her life to solving the most complex environmental challenges facing America. She has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, helping safeguard our public lands and helping communities manage their natural resources responsibly. As Chair of CEQ, I'm asking her to coordinate our environmental efforts across the entire federal government to solve some of the most persistent environmental problems America faces today. Brenda would be the first African American official to hold this critical position. We are fortunate that one of the most widely respected environmental leaders in the country accepted the call to serve again. To serve as the first-ever National Climate Advisor and lead the newly formed White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, I appoint Gina McCarthy. The fact I've asked a former EPA Administrator to take this role and lead this new office shows how serious I am. Gina's got more than 30 years of experience. She's a policy wonk and a people person. A problem-solver and coalition builder. As EPA Administrator, she was instrumental in carrying out the Obama-Biden Climate Action Plan. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Getting toxins out of the air we breathe. Conserving critical water sources. She led our effort to help lower carbon emissions of existing power plants and power plants of the future. And by doing the necessary work here at home, she helped us rally the world around the Paris Climate Accords. Today, I'm asking her to take a singular focus on carrying out our ambitious climate agendahere at home, while my Special Envoy John Kerry leads our climate efforts around the world. I'm grateful to work alongside her again. And to serve as Deputy National Climate Advisor, I appoint Ali Zaidi. He served as a top climate advisor to President Obama and me at the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council. He helped draft and implement our Climate Action Plan and secure the Paris Climate Agreement. He currently serves as New York's Deputy Secretary of Energy and Environment and the State's Chairman of Climate Policy and Finance. He's helping to create jobs generating solar and wind power, jobs building electric charging stations and a more modern grid, bold climate action grounded in science, economics, and public health. And, he's an immigrant from Pakistan who grew up in the Rust Belt, outside Erie, Pennsylvania. Ali knows we can beat the climate crisis with jobs. He knows we can deliver environmental justice and revitalize communities too often overlooked and forgotten. And every day he'll walk into the White House, knowing the world is looking for America to lead. To each of you, thank you for answering the call to serve. To your families, thank you. We could not do this without you or them. To the career civil servants at these agencies, we look forward to working with you to once again carry out your department's mission with honor and integrity. And to the American people , yes, the goals I've laid today are bold. The challenges ahead are daunting. But I want you to know that we can do this. We must do this. And we will do this. We are America. And there's nothing we can't do when we work together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. I'll now turn it over to the team, starting with our next Secretary of the Interior, Congresswoman Deb Haaland.",

E have a whole stadium behind. I want to just thank everybody. It is a great turnout. They wanted a bigger space. They got a bigger space because seven days from now we're going to win this state and we are going to four MAWR. Incredible years in the White House. Thank you, Thistle. Election is a choice between a Trump super recovery or a Biden depression. That's what you're gonna have with the raise of taxes, the biggest tax increase in our history. It's ridiculous. It's a choice between a trump boom or a Biden locked down. Let's lock it all down. And by the way, speaking of lockdowns, let's get your governor toe. Open it up, Let's get him open. It's a choice between our plan to cut your taxes or even and I have to tell you, you know, we've given you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. You know, that biggest regulation cut in the history of our country and sleepy Joe Biden. His plan is to raise your taxes at a level that our country has never raised taxes before. Somehow, that doesn't work too well. Do you agree? I don't think so. I don't think so. I've never heard of it before, but that's okay. You can't hear of everything, right? All my life, I've watched people want to cut taxes. Here's the guys he's running on the basis of Let's raise everybody's taxes. Next week, Wisconsin's going to answer the call of history once again. We had a great victory here. Did we have a great Remember that four years ago? They said, Donald Thas won The state of Wisconsin has been a long time since Republican did that, but we're actually much higher now than we were then. We have a campaign that's actually more enthusiastic, and that was I would say, that had to be number one in history four years ago. But you know what? This is going to be the most important election in the history of our country because you see what's happening, the radical leftists and you're going to defeat Biden and dark money donors and corrupt special interest. One of the most important issues in this election is law and order. We say it long away. Joe Biden and his party incite violence and hatred against our police officers. And we're not doing that. No, we're not doing that. Remember the debate? The first debate? As which one. Did you like better the first one or the second one? Jesus book? Yeah, that's a fat. He said. Man, my man is there. Yep. Did anybody see the last one? Anybody watching? Seems to have had a very big impact. We learned a lot about him. He's number one. He's against oil deaths. Probably likes wind, but wind is very intermittent. Let's watch the president tonight on television. I'm sorry, darling. The winds not blowing Last night, Philadelphia was torn up by Biden supporting radicals, 30 police officers, Philadelphia police officers, great people. They were injured some badly. Biden stands with the rioters and I stand with the heroes of law enforcement. And you know what? They can do their job very easily. Just let them do their job. The Biden Harris plan would end cash bail. You know they wanna have cash bail so everyone just walks around, no matter what they do. Ends cash, bail freeing 400,000 dangerous criminals. It would slash police budgets all over the country. It would tie the hands of every police officer in the country, and they would a point. Anti police prosecutors in every community in America. I don't think that's for Wisconsin. We know each other well. Biden this often weak and too scared to be present. He doesn't want to be president. Let's face it, I have. You know, you got his bad body language. There's a lot of bad, but his men knows buddy language better than any man I know. That's a lot of bad body language from Joe. You know, he got out yesterday. You saw that because we're making speeches all over Pennsylvania. He got out and he got out of Delaware. He said, What's the closest point to Pennsylvania? It was just a few minutes from his basement, and he went and made a speech, and that was a mistake because I had to take him off the stage because they didn't. He didn't know where the hell he waas that didn't work out too well because he had a lid, you know, like a garbage Can you put it in the can. It's a lid. It's called the lid, but he doesn't want to be president. One thing about this job, you gotta want it. You gotta want it. This is tough and doing this. I don't usually say it, but I say it doing this on. Unlike Biden, who's made a fortune in politics, What a fortune. The press is not allowed to write about that, though, but Biden made a fortune. You know what? This has cost me billions of dollars, and you know, I could not be happier because we have done things that nobody else could have done in the 1st 3.5 years. There's been no administration that's done what we've done in the 1st 3.5 years with our military, with our vets, with regulations, with cutting taxes. Biden's running mate, the most liberal member in the U. S Senate, she makes Bernie Sanders look like he's a conservative, even urged their supporters to donate to a fund to bailout rioters in Minneapolis, where they had such problems until the National Guard went in and they stopped it. Would you say that was about what, 22 minutes it was all over, including an attempted cop killer. They wanted to bail them out. The policies will set cop killers free. We believe if you murder a police officer, you should get the death penalty. And I know you're a statement. You murder a police officer you saw a month ago. The two young officers sitting in a car and the guy comes up. Now you do that stuff and you can't get away with it. When the Violent Mob came. Thio Kenosha. You know Kenosha. Everybody know Kenosha. Biden oppose sending in the National Guard. We sent in the National Guard and we saved Kenosha. We saved Kenosha. Kenosha wouldn't be standing and I got a lot of credit. Thank you to the sheriff and so many others for their support. They've actually came out and supported me. Thank you very much. Where's the sheriff? Busy around here someplace. What a hell of a shelf. Thank you very much. That's great. I appreciate too. That's the first time you ever did it. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. It has good man. Good man. It took generations to build the America that we know and love. But if the radical left gain power. It would take them only a matter of months to burn it down, tear it down or destroy it. I'm the only one standing between you and the left wing mob. I hate to tell you, there aren't too many of us, but we're standing in your Second Amendment and many other things, right? Biden is not only declared war on one police, I mean, you know, it really is. My father told me a long time. Don't use the word cops, because the word cops, that's a little slang always calling police, so I never use it. You know, I see cops, but sometimes it's not bad. Sheriff, let me ask you cops or police, or doesn't it matter if it's done with the heart? Who cares, right? Right. If it's done with the heart. So, like I said, he declared war on the cops and it's not working out too well. You're gonna see something. You're going to see a giant red wave on Tuesday. You're going to see a red wave like they've never seen before. And they saw a very big one. I'll tell you what, they got a glimpse on four years ago because that was I remember. They said, Where did these people come from? Where did they come from? They're great Americans. They don't want anything. They just want that level playing field. And they came out and they voted. And this is gonna be bigger. This is gonna be bigger and they know it. They know they know it. They don't like to report it. They see what's happening. They see what's happening. Mike, Don't they get it? It's gonna be very big, and it's gonna be beautiful and it's probably going to start. It doesn't have to start on Tuesday. It could sort earlier. Early voting. You want to be there? You know these ballots. You see what I write about the ballots? It's messed up like you wouldn't believe. Now they say we'd like Thio get the ballots and maybe get him within a few days of the election and we'll take 10 days to count them up. Good. Let's let the whole world wait while you count your balance. And you know what happens while they're counting them? They're dumping more balance in their okay. Where they Where did they come from? Now they have to. We had a great ruling right here. We had a great ruling, right? Got that? Yesterday, Supreme Court said No, that's your date. That's it's called November 3rd. That's your date, right? But sleepy Joe declared war on American workers, and Biden spent the last 47 years outsourcing your jobs. You got hit hard, opening your borders. You don't have borders, you don't have a country and sacrificing American blood and treasure and endless foreign ridiculous wars. Countries most of you, including even most of the people they never even heard of these countries. We're bringing them all back home. You know that, right? They're all coming back home. Afghanistan, Iraq, keeping some in Syria. What if you don't mind? We're keeping the oil. You know, they should have done that. They should have done that with Iraq. Remember, I said, don't go into Iraq, But if you go and at least keep the oil, we didn't keep the oil. Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization. He repeatedly tried to slash Medicare and Social Security. He's a shill, in a sense, for foreign countries. You got to take a look at this guy's record. Of course, right now he has no idea where he is. That's a That's a That's an entirely different problem. That's a very big, different problem. But who the hell look, we have to say it like it is? Hey, we have the greatest country in the world. We have potential like no country has way. Can't play games way can't play games way can't. Besides that, he's not a nice guy. Okay, just so you know, he was never a nice guy, so I feel better. He was a nice guy. I wouldn't say. That's thank you very much. Thank you. Decade after decade, Biden twisted his knife into the back of Wisconsin workers. But workers throughout the United States You don't have to take my word for it. For a special group of people. The people of Wisconsin. I spent a lot of money on this crazy video. Look at this and you're going to see. And I hope that people back here can see it. Can you see it too, I hope. Oh, that's terrible. All right. You'll take my word for it. Go ahead, play. I'm My problem is I voted for NAFTA. I'm supporting NAFTA because I think it is a positive thing to do, and I do not pretend to be an expert on international trade matters. Trade agreements like NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China, which forced American workers to compete against people of making pennies an hour, has resulted in the loss of 160 0 jobs. The president is absolutely right when he says that China has been cheating for 25 years and that Bill Clinton did and didn't do enough about it. George W. Bush didn't do enough about it. Barack Obama didn't do enough about a rising China is an incredibly positive development for not only China but the United States and the rest of the world. Rising in China is a positive, positive development. It is in our self interest that China continue to prosper. We want to see China rise. China is a great nation, and we should hope for the continued expansion. China is not our enemy way. Talk about China is our competitors. We should be helping China is gonna be our lunch bizarre. They're not bad folks, folks. China is not a problem allowing China into the World Trade Organization, which he supported. Extending most favored nation status to China, which you supported that those steps allowed China to take advantage of the United States by using our own open trade deals against us. Do you think, in retrospect, that you were naive about China? Who doesn't he deserve some credit for that? It's better. The USMC is better than NAFTA. It is better than NAFTA. I never said I oppose fracking. You said tape. I did show the tape. Put it on your website. I'll put it on, put it on the website. Would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking in a Biden administration? No way would work it out. We would make sure it's eliminated. Guaranteed. We're gonna end fossil fuel no more, No new fracking. I gradually move away from fracking. Andi. I think it's critically important on day one that we end any fossil fuel leases on public lands. Well, what about stopping fracking and stopping pipeline infrastructure? And there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. I have one final would be closed down. Erlinda, would you close down the other way? Transition from the oil industry? Yes. Oh, transition. That is a big in terms of business. That's the biggest thing. Because basically, what he's saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that? Texas. We remember that. Pennsylvania. Oklahoma. Now, to be fair, maybe Biden's not telling us because he's forgotten his own plans. Watch Biden staff quickly swoop in to shuffle them along during a quickie. Escaped the basement trip to Pennsylvania. Here's the deal. One of the things that that is important is that keep in mind, although they're gonna vote on, uh, Barrett. That was terrifying. What kind of country? We're gonna be? Four more years of George, uh, Georgia. He gonna find ourselves in a position where if Trump gets elected, we're gonna be We're gonna be in a different world. That was yesterday. That was all yesterday. So that took place yesterday. Every day we could put up another treat. It's the whole thing is ridiculous. The whole thing, You know, until the plague came in from China, I didn't even have a race. And then it came in and we did a great job. We saved millions of lives. Two million lives. 2.2 million. Who was supposed to this'll guy, You know he didn't see Oh, don't ban it. Your xenophobic Don't ban China. Don't ban China. This is in January very early on very, very early. Everybody said don't band. I'm not blaming anybody, but they all said, Don't bad. I said It's a heavily infected country and starting from there I banned China. Then I banned Europe with all of the problems they were having with Spain and Italy and France of everybody. And I banned I bad Europe. And 2.5 months later he was saying, Don't ban and then he runs for president. He looks out because Pocahontas decided to stay in. So she took a lot of votes away from Bernie, Not too many. She didn't do too well, but she took enough away that he ends up winning on Super Tuesday. Right? And all of a sudden I got this guy running and he starts complaining that I should have moved faster. But he was 2.5 months behind, and I said, That's gonna be hard to explain, but I have to explain it to people. One thing nice is when you put this thing up here, saves you a lot of words, right? It saves you a lot of words. And then the other thing, remember, for a year we will not frack. Now it affects you because of your energy costs and all of the things that affects everybody. We're right now. Energy independence. It's a great thing first time, but it really effects. Can you imagine Texas, Pennsylvania, The different places? Ohio. So many places. So many places. North Dakota. Can you imagine? Take Texas. I mean, he's a good soil. He's against guns and he's against religion, right? Other than that, he's wonderful. He's just perfect. And then they say it's a very close race in Texas. I don't think so. Year against year against oil, guns and God, you don't have a close race in Texas. I don't think, but they said it the same thing four years ago that Texas is too close to call. It's going to be a very, very tough race for Donald Trump that it was Donald right now, they call me President out of respect, I'm sure for the office it will be a very, very, very tough race. I mean, the polls have closed in Texas. Donald Trump has won. The state of Texas was like, Well, they're one thing. They don't do that unless you have a landslide. So we had like, and now they do the same thing again. Well, this time at least they say I have a little lead. How can you have a little lead when I'm the oil person Who we needed to fire up your factories and you just we can't. They don't even know how to do it. They have, like, a O C plus three. They say, Okay, we'll get rid of all fossil fuels. We have a problem in Wisconsin. We're doing very well. We have a lot of factories. We have a lot of plans. How are we gonna fire him up? She has no clue. She has no clue. I don't even think she studied it. It may be in high school. She studied it, but probably not in college. Did she go to college? Tell me, did she? Because I don't know. I don't know her background, but it is not heavy into the environment. All of a sudden, she comes up with the green New Deal, and these people all did because they have to, because the radical left wants him. The green New Deal will cost $100 trillion. If we have 100 perfect years the greatest years of the history of our country, we can't make it. With 100 trillion spent on the Green New Deal in 2016 Wisconsin voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider is president who is finally putting America first. And if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician. It's one of the reasons I was elected. E was a politician. I probably wouldn't have been elected right. If I don't always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for you, and I'm fighting for you harder than any president has ever fought for you. Together, we'll continue to fight for American workers, support our police, defend our second amendment, which is under siege. But don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. It's fine, but it is under siege. Secure our borders and you know the wall is upto over 400 miles right now. We have very soon over four. We're gonna have it finished very soon. They don't talk about it anymore. You know, They used to go. He will never get it built because that was like you could The Democrat Party were so against it. They said it was obsolete. Use drones so we could watch everybody pour into the border. Let's send a drone up there. Right. Walls and wheels, right? Walls and wheels never get obsolete. There's about the only two things I know of that don't get obsolete. Everything else is obsolete. About 15 minutes after you figure it out and ensure mawr products air proudly stamped with that wonderful, beautiful phrase made in the Yusa right way will deliver record, prosperity, epic job growth and a safe vaccine that eradicates the virus and quickly ends this pandemic. And, you know, with fake news everything is Covic. Covic, Covert Covert. I had it. Here I am, right. I had it. First lady had it. Baron had it, but Baron had it for about 12 seconds. Young, young and immune. System young. No, it z co vid you turn on the news covert Cove in. You know when they're going to stop talking about it so much November 4th. You're right, November 4. It's a whole crazy thing. I mean, it's too complicated to explain. These people are very corrupt, very dishonest. But they got a lot of problems. On November 4th, you'll hear we're doing extremely well and you'll see it. You'll see, you know that You always say that Europe look a Europe Look at Europe Well, first of all, they count their cases totally differently. But look at your well. They have a big spike and you know what? It's going to go down. And we had a spike in Miami. We had a spike in Texas, Arizona. It's all way down to very low numbers, but I'll tell you all they want to talk about is co vid. But the good news on the fourth, they'll stop talking. You watch, they'll stop talking. You get out that red wave. Just get out. We have to win this election. This is the most important election we've ever had. We can't let this radical left socialist group takeover on. I've been saying it now for a long time because I see it. This this inclination by a group of people, Our country will never be a socialist nation. We will never become a socialist nation. Normal life will fully reason. That's all we want is normal life seven months ago, right? We have the greatest economy in the history of our country. Everybody was doing well, best numbers we've ever had. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You see what's happening. You see how it's being built up. And by the way, I'd love to do stimulus. But crazy Nancy doesn't wanna do it. She wants to get bailout money for her Democrat run states that are high crime and doing badly. And I spoke for Wisconsin. What? I said, No, thank you, Nancy. Have a good time. We'll get big stimulus right after the elections over. Hopefully, we can take back the house, too. Be nice. Get rid of her. Get rid of her speaker, will get Kevin and their Kevin would be good. You know who Kevin is? Kevin McCarthy. If Biden and the Democrat Socialists were elected, they will bury your regular. You know what's going on right with your regulations. I've got your regulations down to a level, but we can go further. We have statutory requirements were going further. They'll bury your really your family and yourself and regulations terminate religious liberty, dissolve our borders, indoctrinate our Children with that really bad stuff that they want to teach in schools, which we've largely ended. But it could be started again and destroy the suburbs beyond repair. Suburban women. You're gonna love me. You better love me. Did you see 60 minutes the other night? I always joke. I say suburban women. I'm getting rid of that regular. You know, there's a regulation that essentially destroyed the suburbs. Okay, It would have. You know who was in charge of it? Who would have been Cory Booker? Good luck, Corey. He's another beauty. He's another. We deal with the real beauties, but we had a regulation where they can build low income housing and projects in in the neighborhood near you, You know, right in the neighborhood, near you, in the suburbs, right? So the fake news was saying We think that Donald Trump is having problems with suburban women. I said, Why? Because I'm going to stop crying from going to the suburbs because you know, Antifa and the anarchists they view the suburbs is next. That's what they would like. So the suburban woman wants law and order. They want safety and they don't want a regulation that's going to destroy the suburbs. And then I listen to these people talk about how so Four years ago, they talked about the same thing. They said women will not be voting for Donald Tand then after about four hours and they declared total victory for Trump, you know, they said he cannot get 2 to 70. He cannot. This was in the afternoon. He can, and for about six months before that, by the way, didn't just started there. Donald Trump cannot get you need to 70 right? Cannot get to 270. He cannot get. And they were right. We got 306 way picked up a place called Wisconsin that helped me. Oh, that wasn't That wasn't high on the list of victories. Now it is, but we just know it just came out. Were leading by like, three points. That's good. They won't report. They they won't report that they look at 30 polls. They look at 30 polls. Some of them are totally fake. Some of them are sick coz, right? They look at Paul's, where they interview 38% Democrats, 21% Republicans. I said, That doesn't sound like to fair to me and they'll say Trump is down by five. Well, if I'm down by five when they're doing 38 to 21 that means I'm winning in a landslide. What kind of polls are these now? Seriously, what kind of polls are these? People are crazy. Joe Biden will delay the vaccine. Postponed therapies, prolonged the pandemic. Shutter your schools, open you schools, please bankrupt your small businesses and shut down our country. He will destroy our country. And by the way, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. I said that a long time ago, except what I originally said that I had no, you know, I felt it. I felt it was bad. I just felt it was an instinct. It can't be worse than the problem itself. So the shutdown, with alcoholism, with drugs, with abuse, with suicides, with all the things that happened, it's worse. You can't do this. You gotta get your governors to open up. There aren't many of them. There aren't many of them now. But you gotta now one of the reasons this is another one on. We'll go to the fourth, right. November 4th. They'll be announcing We're opening our ST one of them stupidly, like, three weeks ago. Now, you know, we think we're gonna open probably around November 4th. How about that, genius? Okay, no, there'll be alot be open around a couple of days after the election. Biden even wants toe lock down young and healthy Americans. Yet for those under age 50 the recovery rate is 99.98%. Think of that 99.98 And for school kids, it's lower than it's better than that. Biden's cruel and sensors lockdowns would cause countless deaths from suicide and from all of the problems we have. And we would have problems and economic people lose their jobs. They lose their jobs, they're small businesses go out or they work for small businesses or big businesses that go out, get open up our states. We got to tell you, Governor, we gotta open up our states Does anybody like your governor? Do you like him? Okay, let's have Who likes the governor? Is he gonna win re elections? Who does not like the governor? All right. It's interesting. Lots of lot, Governor. They're gonna open up now. A lot of governors that did this, you know, Michigan. She the only one that it was allowed toe go around. And Rome was her husband, right? He was allowed to go fishing and sailing. Nobody else was there to stay locked up in their house. But we want a Supreme Court case against them. They found it unconstitutional that she locked down the state of Michigan. I just left Michigan. I gave a speech in 32 degree weather in the rain. And they're great people. They're strong people. So I said, You know what I'll do? I won't put on a hat, Okay? And I'll just stand there in Iran on. I'll freeze it. I'll make a speech. But I'll tell you, there was such love. It was incredible. We're winning. We're winning Michigan, too. No, no, e had a nice hat. I was gonna put it on and they were waiting for four or five hours. I mean, I said I feel so guilty. I mean, I wasn't there, but to get there very early. Like probably some of you. You got here very early. Right, Elise? Front rowers I know. Got here. I know the front rowers get here very early. I mean, we have it where they get 34 days in advance. They were you here? 34 days. Yeah, I know. Will you vote? You promise? You voted for Trump? She's great. Now we have great people we've never had. Four years ago, we had the most enthusiastic campaign anyone's ever seen. Probably there ever waas this this campaign. And I never thought I'd say it has mawr enthusiasm mawr support that we did four years ago. Uh, because, you know, four years ago, I was a business guy. I was successful. I was very successful. I came and I said I was gonna dio get it out of your sister. So four years ago I came and I saw trade. I probably trade was you know, I just drove me crazy. We're losing all our factories, closing all our factories. They're moving to Mexico. They're making it in China. They're doing all these things. A lot of people, a lot of places moved up to Canada. Canada was very tough with us, But a lot of I saw this. That's really the main reason I ran. But I saw it all happening. It was so easy to see. I saw it all happening, and that's probably the main reason I ran. But four years ago, I was just saying, I'm gonna cut your taxes. I'm gonna cut regulations. I'm gonna rebuild your military. I'm gonna dual the things I said. And actually, I did more because, like Space Force, we opened up Space Force. I never said I was gonna do that. I learned that after watching Russia and China and everything else, I learned that after us here. But I never took one of these people right back there. Said he may be the only politician that actually did Mawr than he promised during the campaign. I believe that's true. So we have. So we have actually Mawr enthusiasm because I did everything. I mean, I said the wall, the wall was I mean, the wall was just a very expensive. The Border Patrol wanted a certain way very expensive. I mean, they're right. They wanted vision. They wanted steel. They wanted rebar. They wanted concrete inside and they said, You know what? I'll do it. I want to do it the way you want it. I don't want to give you any excuses for doing a bad job in the border G if you only would have built the wall right? But all of the things that I said I did everything I said I did, and that gives this campaign more energy than a guy that was successful. That said, Hey, I'm going to do a lot of things because you've been hearing that for years from politicians and they don't do it, they don't get the job. As I said about buying the other night at the debate, Joe, you're all talk and no action and it's true on I'd look at him and say, Joe, why didn't you do it? You know so well, we should have done this. We should have been I said, Joe, you've been there for 47 years and you left 3.5 years ago. It's not like you left 30 years ago. You left 3.5 years ago and I only ran because of you, Joe, because if you and Obama did a good job, I wouldn't have run. I mean, there would have been no reason. And if I did, I probably wouldn't have been able to win, so I only ran. It was quite it was quite insulting to him, but that's the way it is. Biden had no plan. No idea. He didn't have a clue. He just wants to lock up this country. I mean, he really does. He's gonna lock it up if one guy walks up and says, Sir, I think we should close up our country. Okay, that sounds good to be while letting rioters and looters run wild. Or is Joe calls them peaceful protesters. I call you protesters. You know why? Because there's a legal definition. You can't have a political rally. They did that to keep me out, right? So I said, Oh, I see. You're protesters. The only thing you can do is protest. Because they wanted to protect anarchists, rioters, people that were burning down your stores. So you have the absolute right to protest. So I call this a friendly protests. Okay, Officially, not a rally. A thistle is not a rally. It's a friendly protest. Okay, Now we've gotten over the legal hurdle, haven't we? These people don't believe in science. They believe in whatever gives them powered. Whatever gives them control. The Biden plan will crush you and crush your family. We will crush the virus and make our success make this country mawr successful than it's ever been. We have that kind of potential. We have the foundation set. You see what's happening. You see the kind of numbers we're doing. We're going to make our country mawr successful quickly than it's ever been. When the China plague arrived, we moved heaven and earth to fight the disease. We airlifted medical supplies, pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reduced the fatality rate 85%. Think of the 85. And now it's actually higher than that. Well, here I am. I mean, I'm here, right? I said, give me that stuff. Whatever the hell it is, Doctor, I want it. Next day I woke up and I felt like Superman. Right? I said, Get me the hell out of here. I have to go toe Wisconsin tonight on saved Over two million lives are excess mortality rate has been 42% less than Europe's. Think of that. 42% and I'm working and we're working with your very closely look. They have a problem. We all It should have never been allowed to leave China ever. It should have never been allowed. It didn't go once it got Wuhan Wuhan province. It never got out, but it came to the U. S. A. And Europe and the rest of the world. I'm working to make the breakthrough treatment I received. So what we're doing is we're going to make the Regeneron and Eli Lilly a great company has a similar anti body drug antibody drug, and we're going to make that available to people that needed free. All I know is I didn't feel great. And after I took that, I woke up the next morning and I wanted I tell you, I felt like I could take on the world. I said, Let me at it. And here we are, standing here Freezing. Thanks are relentless efforts. 97% of all current emergency room visits are for something other than the virus. You don't hear these numbers from the fake news? Think of that 97% and we're on track to deliver 100 million doses of safe vaccine. And I say we're turning the corner. We're turning the corner. We're rounding like this racetrack. Look at this is perfect. We're rounding the curve. We will vanquish the virus. And by the way, we're gonna have the vaccine. Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, Modern, great companies. And others, too. We have the vaccine. We're gonna have it very soon. Like very soon. We're going to deliver it. But without it also, we're rounding the curve. We're rounding the corner. It's happening. We're gonna emerge stronger than ever before. Biden's made a corrupt bargain. And the Democrats, in exchange for his party's nomination, he has handed control of his party over to a rage, Phil, Socialists and Marxists and left wing extremists. You see it? You see it in Portland? How about Portland? We could solve that problem in. That's a half A Now, er anarchists. You know what happens to him, right? They go back home to mom and Dad, and they also stay in the basement. That's what they have in common with Jill. Well, no Joe in that one clip, you know, that was yesterday. That took place. That was what happened? He was in the basement. He heard that we were doing really well in Pennsylvania, which we are at least two or three points up. Doesn't sound like much. You know what happens with us. They'll say he's three points up and then you win by, like, 10. There's a lot of hidden votes out there. I don't know if I'm supposed to be complemented by that or not, but they're hidden votes. They don't want to talk. See, they are. They know what they are. All action, right? They call that all actions. If Biden wins the flag burning radicals on the streets will be running for you know that they'll be running your government. They'll be running your government this election day. You must stop the anti American radicals by delivering Joe Biden and those far left Democrats, all Democrats, a thundering defeat. This has to be a big defeat so we can end. It just ended, and Joe Biden, as you see, is a corrupt politician. He wants to send your jobs to China while his family rakes in millions from the Chinese Communist Party. Million's on. He gets money from Ukraine, he gets money from Russia. How about Ukraine? His son sits on the board. No energy experience, No nothing. Didn't have a job. Father becomes vice president. He becomes in charge of Ukraine. Son goes on. The board of Karisma goes on the border. Paris. 183,000 month. Would you say that's good? Would you say that's good. If Biden wins, China wins. China will own the use. A. If this happens and they don't want me to win, they don't want me. We charge them tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs. We never took 10 cents from China, and now we gave out. Where is that? Please go. Where's Hunter? Where is Hunter, by the way? Come to think of it, how about the laptop from hell? Let's call the laptop from them on. Then you see shifty shift. It was Russia that created the laptop. It was Russia. Shifty shift. He says it with a straight face water melon shaped head like a water. It was Russia, I said. Oh, no. Here we go again. When we win, you win. Wisconsin wins and America wins. That's what's goingto happen. We're joined today by members of Wisconsin manufacturers and commerce. That really helped us with this location. And, you know, we're gonna be out of the airport. But the governor made it very difficult. So I said, That's alright. Get a location. Friendly people and your state's there really are your states Chamber of Commerce. And I wanna thank them very much. Where are you folks? Where are you guys? What a group of people. Where? What the hell are you? I met your there, but there they are. Good job. You did. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Good job. I said, how are we doing? They said, sir, you're gonna win easy. That's pretty good. They know the They slightly know the area. I'm thrilled to receive their first ever presidential endorsement. They've been around a long time, and they gave us. We've got a lot of endorsements, Got a lot of newspaper endorsements today to a lot of them all over the country. And every virtually every law enforcement group has given us the endorsement. Even New York's finest. They've never endorsed a presidential candidate, and they wanna be given back. We've got to respect our law enforcement. We've gotta let him do what they have to do. Also with us. His candidate for Congress, Derek Van Orden, is terrific. Quiz. Derek. Derek. Good luck. I hear good things, Derek. I hear good things. Derek Van Orden, please vote for him when his competition is not good. Not good. And also, state GOP Chairman Andrew hit Andrew. Thank you. Are we winning? Andrew, please. If we don't win, we're gonna fire you so fast. Uh, I hear good. Yeah. Just get out that vote. Get out the vote. Together, we built the greatest economy in history, and now we're doing it again. Make America great. Again. Again. Right again. Again. See all those hats. Those hats are obsolete. It's make America great again. Again. We increased middle class family income over $6000 mawr than five times thens made under the last administration. Think of that in a short period of time. African American, Hispanic, American, Asian American unemployment reached their lowest levels ever recorded since April. We created a record 11.4 million jobs. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and proudly signed the brand new U. S. M. C A into law. That's gonna be a big deal just just kicked in Wisconsin, dairy farms were decimated under the Obama and Biden nightmare. They were decimated. And now you are doing very well. And, you know, Canada took advantage of you very much. You know that, right? Not anymore. Under the U S. M c a r dairy exports to Canada are expected to surge by at least 100%. We got rid of the tariffs. You know the tariffs. You know, they used to charge. You didn't know that you like the song o Canada, right? Hockey game. Nice song O Canada. Their national anthem, right? By the way, they stand for nationalism. Are people have to stand for our national anthem? They have to stay, but Canada treated us badly. 287% tariff. Can you believe that? Think of it. I learned about that. I said it's time to get out of that crazy NAFTA. NAFTA was a terrible thing When GM went bankrupt. Biden and Obama, through the workers of Delphi Corporation to the wolves, their pensions were wiped out. I signed in order to restore the pensions of Delphi and others and health care benefits promised the workers and these air workers in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin that got really promised a lot of things and it never happened. We took care of it. I will never let anyone rip off our great American worker. They were treated very badly with a lot of promises from Biden and Obama under my By the way you see this, you see the people that get for the crowds. Obama was up. He drew flies. Today, flies do nobody dead court, you know the cars are honking, right? Hong Kong, Kong, Let's go home. I never saw anything like this. They have cars. They have, like 12 cars. Now they have circles. There's a bigger circles for cars together. I never saw anything like it. Obama has no crowd. I thought he had, like a crowd, right? He doesn't have anything. The only one that has smaller crowds. A sleepy Joe Biden. He's got nobody and the press doesn't like covering our crowds. We have the opposite. We have so many people, they don't like it, but they never show. They never show that nobody. Joe was speaking yesterday. There was nobody there before they carried him off the stage. Think of it. He got nervous speaking to nobody. But that wasn't nervous. That was another problem. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U. S. History. My opponent's insane immigration plan completely eliminates US borders. By implementing nationwide catch and release, he would make every you know that is You catch a criminal murderer rapist, You catch. I mean, you have to release them into the United States. Then within two or three years, they're supposed to come back for a trial. We had an argument during the debate. I said, Sleepy Joe. They don't come back. Yes, they do. They proudly come back. No, no, Joe, they're murderers. They don't come back here. I turned out to be right, but, you know, he would make every community into a sanctuary city for violent criminals. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U. S. Military. You know that, right? You were a big beneficiary, this state. Ah, lot of business in the state, including nearly $6 billion to save the historic shipyard. Marinette Marine. You know that, right? And they're great. I was there four or five months ago. I was watching. They built beautiful, Beautiful. It looks like a yacht with lots of weapons on it. The only difference is you got rockets all over the damn thing. But it is beautiful. We killed the leader of Isis, al Baghdadi. We took out the world's number one terrorist. Soleimani is dead Way took out 100% of the Isis caliphate. Also, when I took over when I took over, it was a mess. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. $150 billion.1.8 billion in cash. You know, we got nothing. I recognize the true capital of Israel and open the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And instead of never ending wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East. We're doing it. It's like it's like working out really well. Three countries already, and many are lined up there. All wanting to get in a vote for Republicans is a vote for the American dream. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln. It's a vote for the American dream on. In conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It's already happening. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States right here in Wisconsin. Way will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. You don't want the sanctuary. We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Very important. Supreme Court. You got to do that. You've got to remember a lot of people think that's why I got elected because of the Supreme Court. And we've got already three great justices Amy yesterday. And by the end of the first time we have close to three, maybe more. But approximately 300 federal judges, including Court of Appeals, judge the record. It's a record we will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. So the $2.5 trillion the greatest rockets and missiles hydro sonic, the greatest in the world. They go seven times faster than what we have today. We have tanks, we have planes, we have bombers, We have submarines. We've rebuilt our military. We have the greatest. We have the greatest equipment, the greatest military force in the world. Russia, China, everybody. They are envious. Nobody thought we could do this and we've done it all. It's a lot of it's made right here, but all made in the Yusa, all made in the USA. Our nuclear is now in tippy top shape and just hope, just hope that we never have to use it. That's Ah, we will end surprise Medical building Require price transparency already signed January 1st. That goes into effect. Lower drug prices, even further. Favorite nations. Nobody can believe I did it. We're going to get the lowest prices in the world and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. America will land. The first woman in the moon in the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars and NASA right now is the talk of the world is a space center again. It was closed and a mess when I took over. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school way will teach our Children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag on We will live by the timeless words of our national motto. In God we trust, right? For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Wisconsin. That's what we're doing. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, even grab your boss if you have Thio. Come on, boss. You got to go out and get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. Got to get out. This is a thing you gotta do. Just remember the great Red Wave. It's now just starting to form is and they know it's coming. They know it's coming. We didn't come this far and fight this hard to surrender our country back to the corrupt Washington swamp. On November 3rd, we must finish the job, drain the swamp, go out and vote. Could be before November 3rd. Go out and vote from Green Bay to lacrosse from Madison till Milwaukee and from Janesville, too. Right here in West Salad Way. Inherit the legacy of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their hearts, sweat and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and your drive. We are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning. Winning winning way are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Wisconsin, we have made America powerful again. Way have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. Yeah, on we will make America great again. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you very much. Get out and vote.",

EVERYBODY IN THE MIDDLE AND BELOW, IT IS GOING DOWN. THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE. ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE SACRIFICED TO KEEP US GOING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND BY THE MOST PEOPLE RECOVERY IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THIS IS A STARTLING FACT TO MEET. , TO ME. THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC MADE 300 BILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. 100 INDIVIDUALS MADE $300 BILLION THIS YEAR. THE BOTTOM HALF GOT THIS SLIDE DOWN.

BILLIONAIRES ARE PAYING A TAX-FREE AS INVESTMENT MONEY, A LOWER TAX RATES THEN IF YOU HAVE A JOB AS A PLUMBER. HOW CAN THAT BE? THE MONEY THAT I AM GOING TO RAISE IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE AND GROW THE CLASS BACK , GROW THE MIDDLE CLASS BACK. TO GET IT BACK TO FULL EMPLOYMENT FAST AND HELPLESS BUILD BACK BETTER THAN BEFORE. WE ARE GOING TO CREATED MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. THE PRESIDENT TURNS TO ME, IN THAT STATE OF UNION ADDRESSES, AND HE SAID THAT SHERIFF JOE IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF AND HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. WE GO BACK THE LONGEST EXPANSION IN AMERICAN HISTORY. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY, MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A FUTURE MADE IN AMERICA. UPGRADING THE WATER AND PIPES, MAKING SURE THAT IT IS SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT. BILL AND LAY DOWN BY UNION PLUMBERS AND PIPE FEEDERS HERE. WE ARE GOING TO UPGRADE 4 MILLION BUILDINGS WITH WEATHERIZATION OF 2 MILLION HOMES. THIS WILL. ONE MILLION GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. LOOK FOLKS, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BILL BACK BETTER , BUILD BACK BETTER. HE PROMISES INTRA-FRACTURE PLANTS. HE DID NOT DO ANYTHING. HE PROMISED TO RELIEVE MAIN STREET SLAMMED BY THE RECESSION. GUESS WHERE THAT MONEY WENT THAT THE CONGRESS PASSED? A WENT TO THE WEALTHY. , IT WENT TO THE WEALTHY, AND IT DID NOT GO TO SMALL BUSINESSES. MY PLAN TO REVITALIZE INFRASTRUCTURE IS TO BUY IN AMERICA. WE ARE GOING TO RAISE OVER $3.7 TRILLION BY ELIMINATING THE TAX CUT FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. WE WILL FIX WATER PIPELINES AND UPGRADE LED PLANTS. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD $100 BILLION FOR OUR SCHOOLS. 4 MILLION BUILDINGS. ADVANCED HEATING AND COOLING SYSTEM. THERE WILL BE A RACE FOR JOB CREATION FOR UNIONS, YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE IT. WHAT I DID THE RECOVERY ACT, $800 BILLION. NOT ONE SINGLE SOLITARY DOLLAR WENT TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PREVAILING WAGE. I AM ALSO GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT CORPORATE AMERICA WANTED TO TAKE CARE , TAKEOVER RESIDENCY A PURCHASE SHIPS , APPRENTICESHIPS. I'M GOING TO PASS THE PROACTIVE , PO-ACT. STRENGTHEN LABOR STANDARDS, THE OSHA RULES. THERE IS A LOT THAT WE CAN DO, BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO. WORKERS. HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET BENEFITED. MY DAD HAD ANOTHER EXPRESSION. AFTER HE LOST HIS JOB, AND WE MOVED TO DELAWARE. HE SAID JOEY, A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR GET IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. EVERY TIME THAT WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, DONALD TRUMP SAYS HOAX. I THINK JOBS. NO MATTER HOW MANY LIES HE TELLS, I'M NOT BANNING FRACKING. PERIOD. I SAID INSIDE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE OF POWER'S WITH POWER. THE ONLY POWER THAT WE HAVE IS UNION POWER. YOU ARE THE GUYS THEY KEEP THE BARBARIANS ON THE OTHER CITED AT THE GATE FROM TAKING EVERYTHING. THAT IS A FACT. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE MIDDLE-CLASS PERSON FEARING THE MOST? THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO TEAR DOWN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON IT. WE WILL HAVE A NOT-FOR-PROFIT PUBLIC INSURANCE OPTION. WE WILL INCREASE SUBSIDIES, AND PREMIUMS WILL BE LOWER. WE WILL HAVE PLANS WITH LOWER DEDUCTIBLES AND LOWER OUT OF COSTS EXPENSES. WE WOULD DO THAT WITH THE MONEY THAT WE TAKE BACK FROM THE SUPER WEALTHY. WE WILL TAKE ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, WITH PLANS THAT WILL , WE WILL WORK WITH STATES TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO FREE, HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL. NOT DAYCARE, BUT PRESCHOOL. THE MATTER WHAT THE BACKGROUND, IF YOU START THEM AT AGE THREE, THEY HAVE A 50% CHANCE OF GRADUATING THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND BEYOND, NO MATTER THE BACKGROUND. TALK TO THE WOMEN AROUND HERE. I WAS A SINGLE DAD FOR FIVE YEARS. I COULD NOT AFFORD HELP. THANK GOD THAT HAD MY SISTER AND MOM AND BROTHER TO HELP WITH MY KIDS, WHEN MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KILLED. WHEN ERIE GETS ITS FIRST COMMUNITY COLLEGE OPENED, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS FREE FOR ANYONE WHO QUALIFIES TO GET IN. THAT IS A FACT. THAT COST $6 BILLION A YEAR. THAT IS ABOUT AS MUCH AS WE GIVE AS A TAX REDUCTION FOR RACEHORSES. LOOK AT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF SCHOOL SINCE THE 9/11 GENERATION. THEY GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE, NO GRADUATIONS. THEY ALL GOT SHUT DOWN IN THE GREAT RECESSION AND NOW. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? THEY ARE UNABLE TO MAKE THAT FIRST HOME DOWN PAYMENT. A LOT OF THEM ARE COLLEGE GRADUATES, AND THERE IS NO JOBS, NO ACCESS. I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WILL GET A TAX CREDIT FOR YOUR FIRST TIME HOME BUYING, PROVIDING A DOWN PAYMENT. WE WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND INCREASE BENEFITS FOR MANY OF SENIORS, SO YOU CAN RETIRE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. WE WILL HAVE TO VOTE, LIKE WE HAVE NEVER VOTED BEFORE. EARLY VOTING IS OPEN HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. GO TO EARLY VOTING IF YOU CAN. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM/PA TO FIND OUT WHERE YOU CAN VOTE AND WAKE ABOUT EARLY. MAKE SURE THAT YOU SEAL THE MAIL-IN BALLOT AND A SECRECY ENVELOPE AND SIGNED THE DECLARATION ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE ENVELOPE BEFORE YOU RETURN IT. I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT I AM GOING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I'M GOING TO WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. I AM SO PROUD IN THIS CAMPAIGN TO EARN THE SUPPORT OF SONY PROUD, PATRIOTIC REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING THE HOMELAND SECURITY TOM RIDGE. WE AGREE ON THIS. THIS IS A MOMENT FOR COUNTRY ABOVE PARTY. AFTER ALL THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH, AND AFTER ALL THAT AMERICA HAS ACCOMPLISHED, IT CANNOT BE THAT HERE, IN THE YEAR 2020, THAT WE WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE, TO PARISH ON THIS EARTH, AS LINCOLN SAID. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALL OF THIS DIVISION BEING PUSHED BY THIS PRESIDENT. ALL OF THIS ENCOURAGED. IN THE DEBATE THAT WE HAD, I ASKED HIM TO CONDEMN THE PROUD BOYS? HE SAID TO STAND DOWN AND STAND READY. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY, FOR REAL. WE CAN ARGUE LIKE HELL, THAT THE END OF THE DAY, WE COME TOGETHER. I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES THAN I'VE EVER BEEN. WHY? THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF. I THINK THAT WE CAN PULL THIS TOGETHER. I AM OPTIMISTIC. I'D GENUINELY AM. YET TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GO OUT AND VOTE. THE ONLY WAY THAT WE LOSE THIS IS BY WHAT IS GOING ON RELATIVE TO THE POLLING PLACES. NOT EIGHT SINGLE SOLITARY REASONABLE PERSON SAID THAT MAIL-IN BALLOTS ARE CORRECT. HE IS TRYING TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE THAT. TRY TO PUT PEOPLE IN POLLING PLACES, THE SAME GUYS THAT YOU SAW BLOCKING PEOPLE'S WAY IN VIRGINIA WITH BANNERS AND RACIAL SLUR ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. SO I SAY TO YOU ALL, GOD BLESS YOU ALL. LET'S GO OUT AND VOTE, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. WHERE MY GOING? AM I GOING THIS WAY? THANKS EVERYBODY. THANKS A MILLION. THANK YOU!",

         "THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS THEY SAY, AND PART OF MY CITY, YOUR FAMILY DONE GOOD. A LONG TIME. GOD LOVE YOU. GIVE YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. TODAY, UNFORTUNATELY, AMERICA IS GOING TO HAVE TO SPEAK TO THIS QUICKLY, TRYING TO REACH A TRAGIC MILESTONE. 200,000 DEATHS RECORDED, AS OF TODAY BECAUSE OF CORONAVIRUS. 200,000 DEATHS ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. EMPTY CHAIRS AND UNDOING TABLES, KITCHEN TABLES THAT WEEKS AND MONTHS AGO WERE FILLED WITH A LOVED ONE, A MOM, DAD, BROTHER OR SISTER. IN MANY CASES, THE PAIN WAS MADE A LOT WORSE. I HAD PEOPLE TELL ME THIS WITH CLOSE FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY TELLING ME BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO VISIT THEIR ELDERLY PARENT OR GRANDPARENT IN THE NURSING HOME BEFORE THEY PASSED AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY STORIES I HEARD FROM THE NURSES, SAYING THEY HELD UP THE CELL PHONE TO THE PATIENT ON THE VENTILATOR, IN THE BED. THAT IS ALL THEY CAN SPEAK TO. THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WERE NOT ABLE TO HOLD FUNERAL SERVICES WHERE THEY COULD PRAY TOGETHER AND REMEMBER THE LOVED ONES THAT THEY LOST. SO MANY OF THE RITUALS HAVE COME TO HELP US COPE WITH PAIN AND LOSS, TO HELP US HONOR THE LIVES OF THOSE WE LOVED. THEY ARE JUST NOT AVAILABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC. WHAT WORRIES ME NOW IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH THIS PANDEMIC FOR SO LONG, THAT I WORRY THAT WE RISK BECOME NUMB TO THE TOLL THAT IS TAKEN ON US AND OUR COUNTRY, AND COMMUNITIES LIKE THIS. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. WE CANNOT LOSE THE ABILITY TO FEEL THE SORROW, LOSS AND ANGER FOR SO MANY LIVES LOST. WE CANNOT LET THE NUMBERS BECOME STATISTICS AND BACKGROUND NOISE, JUST A BLUR IN THE NIGHTLY NEWS. THEY ARE NO LONGER WITH US. SO MANY OF THEM DID NOT HAVE TO LOSE THEIR LIVES TO THIS VIRUS. IF ONLY THE PRESIDENT HAD ACTED SOONER. BACK IN MAY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY RELEASED A STUDY SAYING IF WE HAD ACTED ON MONTH SOONER, WE WOULD HAVE SAVED 70 LIVES. THE LEADING MODEL BEING USED TO TRACK THE VIRUS, THAT MODEL SAYS BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THIS YEAR, WHILE WE ARE WAITING FOR A VACCINE, BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR, WE WILL LOSE UP TO 200,000 ADDITIONAL LIVES. IT POINTS OUT THAT IF WE ACT BY DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE IN WISCONSIN, WEARING A MASK AND MAKING MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD SAVE OVER 115,000 OF THOSE LIVES. I HOPE TO GOD WE WILL NOT HAVE TO LEARN THE SAME BAD LESSON WE LEARNED THE FIRST NINE MONTHS. WE HAVE SEEN ONE OF THE GREATEST LOSSES OF AMERICAN LIFE IN HISTORY. SADLY, IT IS NOT OVER. AS AWFUL AS THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN, IT COULD BE WORSE. WE COULD BE LOOKING AT 178,000 LIVES LOST. ALL THE PRESIDENT DOES IS DELIBERATELY CHANGE THE SUBJECT. IT IS INFURIATING. WE COULD SAVE LIVES, IF WE JUST TAKE SIMPLE STEPS. STILL, THE PRESIDENT REFUSES. WE WATCHED TIM HOLDEN INDOOR RALLY WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT KNEW OF THESE DANGERS BACK IN FEBRUARY. HE HID IT FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE UNDERSTOOD HOW BAD IT WAS. THIS IS A DEADLY VIRUS, FAR MORE DEADLY THAN ANY FLU, BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT HE WAS SAYING TO US PUBLICLY. PUBLICLY, HE TOLD US IT WAS JUST LIKE THE FLU AND THAT IT WOULD DISAPPEAR IN THE WARM WEATHER. IT WAS ALL A LIE. HE KNEW IT. WHAT WAS HIS EXPLANATION? HE SAID HE DID NOT WANT TO SEE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PANIC. TRUMP PANICKED. THE VIRUS WAS TOO BIG FOR HIM. WITH THIS CRISIS, A REAL CRISIS THAT REQUIRED SERIOUS PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP, HE WAS NOT UP TO IT. HE FROZE. HE FAILED TO ACT. AMERICA HAS PAID THE WORST PRICE OF ANY NATION IN THE WORLD. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING. WE DO NOT PANIC. UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS SAYING BECAUSE IT CRYSTALLIZES HIS WHOLE WORLDVIEW. WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAID HE DID NOT WANT TO CREATE A PANIC, HE WAS NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT A HEALTH PANIC. HE WAS WORRIED THAT IF HE TOLD THE PUBLIC THE TRUTH, THERE WOULD BE A PANIC OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, WHICH WOULD HURT HIS CHANCES OF BEING REELECTED. HE SEES THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. I SEE IT FROM WHERE I GREW UP IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. HARD WORK. YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE, ALL YOU CAN SEE IS WALL STREET. YOU THINK WALL STREET BUILT THIS COUNTRY? YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP THANKS THAT HANDING OUT A TAX GIVEAWAY, PRIMARILY FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS AND WEALTHY QUALIFIERS IS AN ECONOMIC PLAN? YOU THINK LIKE TRUMP THAT $15 IS TOO MUCH FOR AMERICA'S ESSENTIAL WORKERS? ELIMINATED OVERTIME PAY FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICAN WORKERS. TRIED TO TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE FROM 20 MILLION AMERICANS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC. TRY TO TAKE AWAY PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR 130 BILLION AMERICANS. PROPOSED A PLAN, IN ORDER TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD, YOU WILL GET A LITTLE BUMP IN YOUR PAY, BUT WE WILL NOT TAKE OUT WITHHOLDING FOR YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, BUT GUESS WHAT? SOCIAL SECURITY SAYS IF HE DOES THAT, SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE BANKRUPT BY THE MIDDLE OF 2023. YOU MIGHT GET THAT OUT OF YOUR PAYCHECK, A LITTLE MORE IN YOUR PAYCHECK, BUT GUESS WHAT? TELL YOUR MOM AND DAD, SAY GOODBYE TO SOCIAL SECURITY. THEY WILL HAVE TO WORK FOR THEIR WHOLE LIVES. THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT WE GOT OUT OF IT, A LOT OF DAIRY FARMERS AND MANUFACTURING WENT UNDER, BUT GUESS WHAT? STARTING A TRADE WAR THAT A SURGE IN BANKRUPTCY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? I DID NOT KNOW THIS AT FIRST. AMERICA'S BANK GOT TO OPEN UP IN BEIJING. THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO BEFORE. LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. HE HAD A DEAL, BUT HE WANTED THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, BEFORE THEY LOWERED THE PRICES, TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS UNETHICAL. HE ASKED THEM TO SEND OUT $100 CHECKS WITH HIS NAME ON IT TO THE ELDERLY. SAYING THAT IS THE DOWN PAYMENT. THEY SAID, GOOGLE NOT DO THAT. THE DEAL FELL APART. NOW, SOME 30 MILLION PEOPLE ARE ON UNEMPLOYMENT. HERE IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THE TAX RATE ALL OF YOU PAY IS GOING TO BE HIGHER THAN BILLIONAIRES WHO MAKE THEIR MONEY ON INVESTMENTS. HE WANTS TO LOWER AGAIN, LOWER THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX. SOMEONE WHO MAKES THEIR MONEY OFF THE MARKET IS PAYING THE 50% RATE. IT DEPENDS ON THE TAX BRACKET. CLEWISTON PERCENT. THIS TAX CUT WILL COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. WHO IS HYDE DOES IT COME OUT OF? DONALD TRUMP RAN FOR OFFICE SAYING HE WOULD REPRESENT THE FORGOTTEN MAN AND WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY. NOT ONLY DID HE FORGET THEM, THE TRUTH IS THAT HE NEVER REALLY RESPECTED US VERY MUCH. HE LOVES HIS RALLIES. THE NEXT TIME HE HOLDS ONE, LOOK CLOSELY. HE KEEPS HIS DISTANCE FROM ANYONE IN THE RALLY. THOSE WHO COME ARE TIGHT AS CAN BE, RISKING DISEASE, BUT NOT TRUMP. HE KEEPS HIS DISTANCE. A REPORTER TRIED TO COME UP AND HE SAID NO, YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. I DO NOT GET CLOSE TO THESE PEOPLE. EVERYBODY IN THE CROWD RISKS THEIR LIVES, BUT NOT HIM. NOW WE KNOW WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT PEOPLE IN HIS RALLIES. A FORMER EMPLOYEE SAID HE CALLS HIS EMPLOYEES DISGUSTING. SHE DOES NOT HAVE TO SHAKE THEIR HANDS. THAT IS THE GOOD THING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC. THESE ARE ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT AND NOT RESPECT. DO NOT KID YOURSELF. THIS IS A ONE-WAY STREET. NOTHING IS MORE OFFENSIVE THAN THE WAY HE SPOKE ABOUT MANY OF YOU BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED YOUR NATION IN UNIFORM. IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY EVERY OUTLET THAT HE REFERRED TO THEM AS LOSERS AND SUCKERS. THAT IS WHAT TRUMP CALLED THE PEOPLE WHO SERVED AND MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. MY SON SERVED AS A VOLUNTEER TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. HE COME , CAME HOME DECORATED AND DIED OF CANCER. HE WAS NOT A LOSER. HE WAS NOT A SUCKER. HE WAS A PATRIOT. ALL THOSE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE SERVED VOLUNTEERED. JUST LIKE YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS. I HAVE DEALT WITH PEOPLE LIKE TRUMP MY WHOLE LIFE. HE LOOKED DOWN ON US BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. GUYS WHO THINK THEY ARE BETTER THAN YOU, GUYS WHO INHERIT EVERYTHING THEY HAVE EVER GOTTEN IN THEIR LIFE AND SQUANDERED IT. GUYS WHO STIFF ELECTRICIANS AND CONTRACTORS JUST TO PUT A FEW MORE BUCKS IN THEIR POCKET. THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO AVOID PAYING THEIR TAXES BECAUSE THEY FIGURE THE REST OF US, THE LITTLE PEOPLE CAN PICK UP THE TAB FOR THE COUNTRY. DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT THE REASON WE HAVE NOT SEEN TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS IS BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT US TO KNOW WHAT HE PAID? HE HAD TO SUMMON THEM OVER. THEY SHOW THAT HE PAID ZERO. HE PAID ZERO, NOTHING. THAT IS A FACT. AND HE WAS ASKED ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? THIS IS WHY I REALLY DO NOT LIKE GUYS LIKE THIS. HE SAID, IT MAKES ME SMART. PUT ANOTHER WAY, I AM NOT A SUCKER. WHY SHOULD I PAY? ZERO. WALL STREET IS A LONG WAY FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. YOU GET TO SEE THE WORLD A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY THERE. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY. HARD-WORKING PEOPLE BUILT THIS COUNTRY. UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. UNION LABOR, LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. I LEARNED A FEW SIMPLE LESSONS FROM MY PARENTS THAT I NEVER FORGOT. ONE IS FROM MY MOTHER. GENERALLY, REMEMBER, NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU, BUT EVERYONE IS YOUR THE , EQUAL. IT IS PRETTY SIMPLE. WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND WE SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. I GOT MY BACK UP RECENTLY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I SAW ON NATIONAL TELEVISION ABOUT THE RACE. I DO NOT BUY IT. JOE BIDEN WILL BE ONLY THE FIRST PRESIDENT WHO DID NOT GO TO AN IV LEAGUE SCHOOL , IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL IN A LONG TIME. SOMEHOW, IT MEANT THAT I COULD NOT BELONG. HOW COULD A GUY WHO WENT TO A STATE SCHOOL BE PRESIDENT? I HAVE TO ADMIT, I SAID IT. I AM NOT PROUD OF IT. HE CLOSED THE DOOR ON ME. YOU THINK I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH? I AM GOING TO BUST DOWN THAT DOOR. A LOT OF YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY BECAUSE OF OUR STANDING. I SAY, IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT A STATE SCHOOL PRESIDENT SAT IN THE OVAL OFFICE. IF I AM SITTING THERE, YOU WILL BE SITTING THERE TOO. ANOTHER LESSON, I LEARNED FROM MY DAD. MY DAD LOST A JOB UP WE HAD TO MOVE WE HAD TO GO TO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW AND A, CAN JEAN AND THE KIDS STAY WITH YOU FOR ABOUT A YEAR? I WILL MAKE IT UP TO YOU. I HAVE A JOB IN DELAWARE. I WILL COME HOME EVERY WEEKEND. TALK ABOUT PRIDE. HE USED TO SAY, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY, BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, IT IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. THE DIGNITY OF WORK. WHAT YOU DO MATTERS. YOU MATTER. I DO NOT WANT TO PUNISH ANYBODY. IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT WE START TO REWARD WORK. NOBODY MAKING LESS THAN FORTON THOUSAND DOLLARS , $400,000 IN THIS COUNTRY WILL SEE THEIR TAXES GO UP. IF YOU MAKE MORE, YOU WILL START TO PAY MORE. I AM NOT LOOKING TO PUNISH ANYONE. SOME OF THE WEALTHIEST CORPORATIONS NEED TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. MANY OF THEM ARE PAYING ZERO. THEY TAKE NO TAX AT ALL. HOW CAN THAT BE FAIR? THE PRESIDENT TALKS ALL THE TIME ABOUT HOW GREAT THE ECONOMY IS. THE BILLIONAIRES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE SEEING THEIR WEALTH INCREASE BY $800 BILLION. ALL THE BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA, DURING THE PANDEMIC, THEIR NET WORTH, COMBINED HAVE INCREASED BY $800 BILLION. THE REST OF US? 30 MILLION PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED. 20 MILLION AMERICANS ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOME. SEVEN PLUS MILLION AMERICANS ARE WORKING PART-TIME, WHO WANT TO WORK FULL-TIME. EVICTIONS ARE ON THE RISE. FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES, THE KIDS ARE AT HOME AND NOT AT SCHOOL. IT IS THE WORKING PEOPLE WHO KNEW HE'D , WHO NEED A TAX BREAK. YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT. I SAID IT MANY TIMES. NEED TO I'VE SAID IT MANY TIMES DURING THIS PANDEMIC, WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN JUST PRAISE OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS, WE NEED TO PAY THEM. WE NEED TO MAKE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERY AMERICAN. MY PLAN WILL LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BY 60%. IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS OBAMA AND I PUT IN PLACE AND MAKE IT A LOT MORE AFFORDABLE TO HAVE THAT HEALTH CARE. WE NEED TO EMPOWER LABOR UNIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT DIDN'T SAY IN THE 1930'S, YOU CAN'T HAVE LABOR UNIONS. IT SAID WE SHOULD PROMOTE LABOR UNIONS. THAT'S WHAT IT SAID, AND I WILL. ONE MORE THING. UNDER MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN, WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE WITH UNION WORKERS AND PREVAILING WAGE, WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. WE'RE GOING TO REBUILD MANUFACTURING IN THIS COUNTRY. WE'LL DO IT BY ENFORCING A REAL BUY AMERICAN PLAN. LOOK, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT $600 BILLION A YEAR IN PURCHASING POWER THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS EVERY YEAR FROM TAX DOLLARS AND DETERMINES HOW IT'S USED. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GOD WILLING, AMERICAN COMPANIES WITH AMERICAN WORKERS BUILDING AMERICAN PRODUCTS USING AMERICAN SUPPLY CHAINS ARE GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONES WHO GET THE CONTRACTS. THAT MEANS AMERICAN ALUMINUM FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, FOR DEVELOPING MORE WIND AND SOLAR AND HYDROELECTRIC POWER. ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL REPLACE CARS IN THE FEDERAL FLEET. WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST FLEETS IN THE WORLD, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT THEM ALL TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. GUESS WHAT? THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING MUCH MORE LIGHTER FRAMES, MORE ALUMINUM FOR AUTOMOBILES THAT ALREADY IF THEY ARE ALUMINUM BUILT, THEY CAN REDUCE BY 15%, EVEN WITH A COMBUSTION ENGINE. 1.5 MILLION NEW AFFORDABLE HOMES AND HOUSING. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD. THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF WORK, INCREASED WORK AT HOME. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TRANSFER 40 MILLION BUILDINGS AROUND AMERICA TO MAKE THEM WEATHER RESISTANT SO THEY ARE CHANGE THE WINDOWS, DOORS, WALLS, THE WHOLE RANGE. BUILDING BACK BETTER MEANS FIRING UP OUR SHUTTERED FOUNDRIES AND MOVING FORWARD TO BUSINESS THAT IS TRULY MADE IN AMERICA. I WANT TO SPEND A FEW MOMENTS TALKING TO THOSE WHO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP LAST TIME. WHEN I WAS OUT HERE IN OUR ADMINISTRATION, YOU VOTED FOR US. THEN AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTY CHANGED, AND THEY VOTED FOR TRUMP LAST TIME. I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE FRUSTRATED, ANGRY, BELIEVED YOU WEREN'T BEING SEEN, REPRESENTED OR HEARD. I GET IT. IT HAS TO CHANGE. I PROMISE YOU THIS, IT WILL CHANGE WITH ME. YOU WILL BE SEEN, HEARD, AND RESPECTED BY ME. THIS CAMPAIGN ISN'T JUST ABOUT WINNING VOTES, IT'S ABOUT RESTORING THE BASIC DIGNITY IN THIS COUNTRY THAT EVERY WORKER DESERVES. BASIC DIGNITY WE ALL HAVE WITHOUT WINNING BACK HEARTS AND SOUL OF AMERICA, WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN I WAS ASKED ABOUT THE DEATH COUNT APPROACHING 200,000, THE PRESIDENT SAID, AND I QUOTE, HE SAID , I WON'T QUOTE HIM. THE PRESIDENT SAID, IF YOU TAKE OUT THE BLUE STATES RUN BY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS AND JUST LOOK AT THE RED STATES, REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ARE DOING QUITE WELL. NOW, OF COURSE, IT'S A SIMPLE FACTUAL MATTER, IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. IF YOU COUNT ALL THE DEATHS IN THE RED STATES, WE ARE NUMBER TWO IN THE WORLD IN DEATHS JUST BEHIND BRAZIL. BUT MORE FUNDAMENTALLY, IT REFLECTS ON THE PART OF DONALD TRUMP THAT HE HAS A DEEPLY FLAWED AND DIVISIVE VIEW OF THE UNITED STATES. THIS NATION AND THE JOB HE HOLDS. THINK ABOUT WHAT HE'S SAYING. IF YOU LIVE IN A STATE LIKE WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, STATES WITH DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS, YOU'RE NOT HIS PROBLEM. HE HAS NO OBLIGATION TO YOU. HE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU AS PRESIDENT, YOUR FAMILY OR WELL-BEING. I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY. I DON'T PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO RED STATES OR BLUE STATES OF AMERICA, I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ONE NATION UNDER GOD FOR REAL. I'M RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT. I'M NOT GOING TO GOVERN AS A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, I'M GOING TO GOVERNOR AS PRESIDENT. I GET CRITICIZED FOR SAYING THAT SOMETIMES TO SOME IN MY PARTY, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I'M GOING TO FIGHT AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORTED ME AS THOSE WHO DID NOT SUPPORT ME. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT, FOR GOD'S SAKE, THIS HAS TO BE AN AMERICAN MOMENT. IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO PUT ANGER AND DIVISION AND THE DARKNESS THAT'S OVERTAKEN THIS COUNTRY BEHIND US. WE HAVE TO PUT IT BEHIND US. I KNOW I'VE BEEN CRITICIZED SINCE I ENTERED PRIMARIES ABOUT UNITING THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. WE CAN. WE'VE DONE IT SO MANY TIMES IN OUR HISTORY. WE'VE BEGUN ANEW. IF WE GET CONTROL OF THIS VIRUS, WE CAN. WE CAN REWARD WORK. WE CAN FIX THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE CAN BE A SAFE AND JUST NATION. WE CAN DEAL WITH THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WHICH ALUMINUM IS GOING TO BE A GIGANTIC PART OF. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST, ONE NATION. ONE NATION. ONE PEOPLE. ONE AMERICA. WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO IN GOD'S NAME WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN OUR LONG HISTORY, THERE'S BEEN NOTHING WE'VE BEEN UNABLE TO DO , NOTHING WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OVERCOME WHEN WE'VE DONE IT TOGETHER. I'M CONFIDENT GOING ALL OVER THIS NATION, WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY. WE HAVE TO BRING THE NATION TOGETHER. THAT'S GOING TO BE MY PRIMARY JOB. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. GOD BLESS YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. Y'ALL STAY SAFE AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU, MA'AM. APPRECIATE IT.",

         "HELLO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. MY GOODNESS. SUNDAY IN PETERBOROUGH. I TELL YOU WHAT, I LOVE THIS STATE, FOR REAL. YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THAT. I GO BACK A LONG WAY WITH A LOT OF FOLKS WHO REPRESENTED THIS STATE, AND SOME OF YOU HEARD ME SAY IT BEFORE, IT REMINDS ME OF MY HOME STATE OF DELAWARE IN ONE IMPORTANT RESPECT EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. MATTER OF FACT, FIRST TIME I RAN FOR THE UNITED DATES SENATE, I WAS 29 YEARS OLD DOES UNITED STATES SENATE, I WAS 29 YEARS OLD, NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. I BETTER BE CAREFUL. BEEN A GREAT FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. BUT WHEN IRAN, MY STATE WAS A LITTLE LIKE YOURS I RAN, MY STATE WAS A LITTLE LIKE YOURS. I REMEMBER, I STARTED OFF MY CAMPAIGN IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. THEY SPEAK WITH A THICK ACCENT, FOR REAL. WE WERE A BORDER STATE, NOT SURE WHAT SIDE WE WANT TO FIGHT ON IN THOSE DAYS, FOR REAL. THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS VERY SOUTHERN. THEY TALK AT YOU LIKE YOU ARE A GOOD OLD FELLA. THE WAY YOU GO IN DELAWARE, YOU WORK YOUR WAY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. THEY SAID, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY, BECAUSE EVERYONE IS RELATED DOWN HERE. EDGAR C BENNETT YOU COULD NOT CALL HIM ED, IT WAS EDGAR C. IF YOU ARE NOT INVITED TO STAY IN SOMEONE'S HOME IN DELAWARE AND HAVE TO GO TO A HOTEL, YOU KNOW YOU ARE NOT REALLY THAT WELCOME. EDGAR C. SEEMED A LOT MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN I WAS, BUT WERE HAPPY TO HAVE ME TO GO. SO WE WENT TO MASS AND THEN HE WANTED ME TO GO TO HIS CHURCH IN DOWNTOWN SELBY VILLE. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH, METHODIST CHURCH, AND HAD THE GRAVEYARD IN THE FRONT LIKE THE OLD CATHOLIC CHURCH I BELONG TO IN UPSTATE DELAWARE, ST. JOSEPH'S. YOU WALK THROUGH THE HEADSTONES AND THE ENTRANCE TO GO UP. THE MINISTER WAS VERY KIND TO ME WHEN I SHOWED UP AT THE CHURCH WITH HIM. HE SAID, WE HAVE WITH US JOE BIDEN, RUNNING FOR THE UNITED EIGHTH SENATE UNITED STATES SENATE. HOPEFULLY HE WILL GREET THE PARISHIONERS AS THEY WALK OUT. I DID NOT EXPECT THAT, BUT I WAS VERY FLATTERED. SO I STOOD THERE WITH THE MINISTER SHAKING HANDS WITH EVERYBODY. EDGAR SEAT WAS STANDING UNDER THESE BIG OAK TREES THAT TOOK UP THE WHOLE CHURCH AREA. AFTER THE WORDS AFTERWARDS, I WALKED UP AND SAID, IT WENT OK. EXCEPT FOR THAT HORSE'S TAIL OVER THERE. HE SAID OF, THAT IS MY FIRST COUSIN, EDGAR. TRUE STORY. I WANT TO GET YOUR QUESTIONS, SO I WILL BE RELATIVELY BRIEF. NUMBER ONE, THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW, BUT THE SINGLE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ISSUE YOU ON THOUGH, MR. MAYOR, IF WE GET FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP, IT IS GOING TO CHANGE WHO WE ARE AS THE CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE, I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE. IT MATTERS A LOT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO AND WHO WE ARE GOING TO PICK. WHEN I ANNOUNCED FOR THE SENATE, I DID THE SAME THING WHEN I ANNOUNCED FOR PRESIDENT, STATE MERELY WHY I WAS RUNNING WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT. THERE'S THREE REASONS. ONE, TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE I THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED, ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WITH THOSE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE WOODS, SCREECHING, THEIR VEINS BULGING, A YOUNG WOMAN GOT KILLED AND THEY ASKED THE PRESIDENT WHAT THEY THOUGHT, AND HE SAID THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO PRESIDENT HAS NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT, FOR REAL. MAYBE ANDREW JACKSON SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR, BUT NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I AM RUNNING, TO RESTORE A SENSE OF DECENCY AND HONOR. WE HOLD THOSE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THEM BEFORE. THE PRESIDENT HAS THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS WALKED AWAY FROM THEM, BECAUSE EVERY TIME, EVERY GENERATION HAS MOVED THE ARK OF CONCLUSION OF INCLUSION WIDER AND WIDER AND WIDER, AND IT IS BEING SHUTDOWN. I THINK IT IS BEING CORROSIVE FOR THE COUNTRY. THE SECOND REASON I SAID I WAS RUNNING, TO RESTORE THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS TAKEN A BEATING. WE USED TO BE THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD. ALL THE DATA SHOWS THAT 60% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING MAY HAVE HAD. WE HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THAT WAY BEFORE IN THE LAST CENTURY. WE HAVE NEVER LOST THAT SENSE OF OPTIMISM BEFORE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED. THIS TIME WHEN WE REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, WE HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. EVERYBODY ALONG. FROM THE DISABLED TO PEOPLE OF CALLER, AS WELL AS HARD-WORKING PEOPLE MY DAD WOULD SAY I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, I WANT THEM TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEM, THE GOVERNMENT. JUST GIVE ME A SHOT. THE THIRD REASON I WAS RUNNING IS BECAUSE WE HAD TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. I WAS PRETTY ROUNDLY CRITICIZED BY A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES, ALL 900 RUNNING FROM THE PRIMARY NO, THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE. THEY REALLY ARE. THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY WOULD SAY YEAH, JOE BIDEN USED TO BE ABLE TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER BEFORE, REMEMBER? HEATED THE ARMS CONTROL TREATIES, HE DID AND THEY WOULD GO THROUGH ALL THE THINGS I HAVE DONE, BUT THAT WAS THE OLD DAYS. THIS REPUBLICAN PARTY IS DIFFERENT. IT IS DIFFERENT, BUT IT WAS ONLY THREE YEARS AGO THAT WE DID A LOT OF THESE THINGS. I THINK UNIFYING THE COUNTRY IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. I DO NOT THINK IT IS NAIVE I UNDERSTAND THIS NEW REPUBLIC AND PARTY WELL. I HAVE BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END OF DONALD TRUMP'S BILLION DOLLARS OF ADS TRYING TO THIS MERGE MY ONLY SURVIVING SON, GOING AFTER MY FAMILY, GOING AFTER ME I UNDERSTAND THEM. I UNDERSTAND THEM WELL. BUT IT IS NOT ABOUT ME, IT IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM AND AROUND THE COUNTRY. PRESIDENTS SHOULD NOT HOLD GRUDGES. THEY SHOULD BE ELECTED TO RUN AND REPRESENT ALL THE PEOPLE. ALL THE PEOPLE. IMMIGRANTS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS, BECAUSE DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS, BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T COME TOGETHER WE CAN DO ANYTHING. THIS COUNTRY IS DESIGNED TO REQUIRE CONSENSUS. WITHOUT IT, THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN GET DONE OTHER THAN THE ABUSE OF POWER BY A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS, I CAN'T GET IT DONE THOUGH I AM JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT. I DO NOT THINK IT IS NAIVE AT ALL TO TALK ABOUT UNITING THE COUNTRY. AND THE NEED TO DO IT. I BELIEVE WE CAN, BECAUSE I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION SOME OF THE PEOPLE I AM RUNNING WITH IN THIS NOMINATION SAY TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE WILL BE FOREVER AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER. IT CANNOT BE SUSTAINED IN AMERICA. IT CANNOT BE SUSTAINED. IT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. SO WE HAVE TO. WE CANNOT SURRENDER THE NOTION. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. BUT I HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF HARD THINGS DONE BEFORE. DOES NOT MEAN IT IS NOT GOING TO BE HARD THIS TIME. HERE IS THE DEAL. YOU CAN GET REPUBLICAN SOMETIMES IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE TO VOTE WITH YOU, AND WHEN YOU DON'T, YOU GO OUT AND BEAT THEM. AND I DO NOT MEAN BY GOING AFTER THEIR PERSONALITIES OR THE DIRTY POLITICS OF GOING AFTER THEIR MOTIVES. LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN AMERICAN POLITICS. EVEN SMALL STATES THAT ARE CLOSE LIKE YOURS AND MINE. WHAT HAPPENS? I COME TO YOU AND I SAY, LOOK. I THINK YOU ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG BUSINESS. I THINK YOU ARE IMMORAL. I THINK YOU ARE THIS BY THE WAY, LET'S WORK OUT A DEAL ON HOW WE ARE GOING TO WORKOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. FAT CHANCE. I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO FROM MIKE MANSFIELD, THE MAJORITY LEADER FROM MONTANA, MORE INTEGRITY IN HIS LITTLE FINGER THAN MOST PEOPLE HADN'T HIT THEIR WHOLE BODY HAD IN THEIR WHOLE BODY, FOR REAL. HE SAID IT IS NOT ALWAYS APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION A MAN OR WOMAN'S MOTIVES, BUT IT IS ALWAYS APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION THEIR JUDGMENT. YOU DO NOT KNOW THEIR MOTIVES. QUESTION THEIR JUDGMENT. THEN YOU CAN GET SOMETHING PASSED. WHEN IN FACT A LOT HAS CHANGED WITH THIS PRESIDENT. WHEN THE CARDI SHOW CARNIE SHOW COMES THROUGH TOWN AND YOU FIND OUT THERE ARE NO PEANUTS UNDER THE THREE SHELLS, YOU USUALLY KNOW BETTER THE SECOND TIME. BETTER THE SECOND TIME. BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. WHEN IN FACT SO MUCH HAS CHANGED, I THINK THE ENVIRONMENT IS SO RIGHT FOR US TO DO SO MUCH MORE, NOT AS DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS, BUT AS A NATION. WE CAN ONLY 21ST CENTURY. WE OWN THE 21ST CENTURY. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC IN MY LIFE ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF THIS COUNTRY. FOLKS, LOOK. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE WHEN THE REPUBLICANS DISAGREE WITH US, IF I'M YOUR PRESIDENT, IF THEY DISAGREE WITH US, HERE IS THE DEAL. TAKE IT TO THEM IN THEIR DISTRICTS. CAMPAIGN. FOR EXAMPLE, I WENT TO 24 STATES AND CAMPAIGN FOR 67, 60 9 I AM NOT SURE THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES LAST TIME OUT IN 2018. THE ONLY GUY INVITED IN ALL THE STATES, FROM ALABAMA TO MONTANA TO COLORADO TO PENNSYLVANIA, STATE THAT WE LOST AND/OR WERE CLOSE. GUESS WHAT WE DID? WE DID NOT GO AFTER THE PERSONALITIES OF THE PEOPLE WE RAN AGAINST, WE SAID WE ARE GOING TO WIN 41 FEET AND TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. WE WON 41 SEATS. BY THE WAY, FOUR ACADEMY GRADUATES, ONE THE FIRST MARINE FIGHTER PILOT, DROPPING BOMBS. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE GROUP. WHAT DID WE DO? WE SAID, ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN PEOPLE REALIZED REMEMBER, WE LOST THE HOUSE WHEN WE PASSED OBAMACARE. PEOPLE SAID, YOU LOST BECAUSE IT IS NOT POPULAR. THEN WHAT HAPPENED?THEN ALONG CAME THE REPUBLICANS IN THIS STATE AND OTHERS AND SAID, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE AWAY OBAMACARE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ANYMORE. YOU CANNOT KEEP YOUR CHILD ON YOUR HEALTH-CARE POLICY UNTIL AGE 26 ANYMORE, ETC. EVERYONE SAID WELL, WHAT? BECAUSE PEOPLE DID NOT EVEN KNOW IT WAS OBAMACARE. I SAID TO THE PRESIDENT I KEEP ON PICKING ON JOHN, BUT JOHN KNOWS MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP HERE. YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT. I GOT IN TROUBLE ARE SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE A FIRESIDE CHAT REMEMBER THAT? BUT THE PRESIDENT SAID, WE DON'T HAVE TIME. THERE'S TOO MANY THINGS WE HAVE TO FACE TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP. IT WASN'T UNTIL PEOPLE STARTED TO TAKE IT AWAY THAT PEOPLE STARTED TO REALIZE, WHOA. IF YOU ARE A STATE REPRESENTATIVE, GOVERNOR, YOUR SENATOR, YOUR CONGRESSMAN WANTS TO TAKE AWAY THIS THING YOU HAPPY. YOU HAVE. PEOPLE SAID NO. AND WE WON. WHEN YOU CANNOT CONVINCE, YOU GO OUT AND MAKE THE CASE. PEOPLE KNOW I AM CONCLUDING WITH THIS AND I WILL GO TO QUESTIONS, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, FROM EDUCATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE, TO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT. CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH A WHOLE RANGE OF ISSUES, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, WHICH THEY ARE TRYING TO KILL, A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. EVERYBODY WHO KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS I AM NOT BEING FACETIOUS. THIS IS REALITY. EVEN THE SUPPORTERS KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY KNOW WHO HE IS, PEOPLE LIKE CAM, THEY KNOW WHO HE IS. NONE OF THEM ARE ARGUING THAT THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO GROW UP WITH THE SAME CHARACTER, BUT THEY KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY DECIDED THEY LIKE HIM BECAUSE OF THINGS HE DID OR THINGS DEMOCRATS DID NOT DO OR WHATEVER. WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW THAT WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. BECAUSE HE FEEDS ON FEEDING FEARS PEOPL FEEDING FEAR TO PEOPLE. IF YOU SAY THE LIE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN, IT BREAKS THROUGH. IF YOU SAY IT AND SAY IT AND SAY IT WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. OVER FICTION. FOR REAL. . WE GOT A LOT OF WORK CUT OUT FOR US. I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING EVERYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 15. WE OWE YOU BIG, KIDDO. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT HERE, BUT AFTER THIS IS OVER, COME UP AND TALK TO ME. EVERYBODY UNDER 15, YOU GET SOMETHING SPECIAL TODAY, BECAUSE THIS HAS TO BE BORING, BORING, BORING FOR YOU. THANK YOU. MY MOTHER WOULD OFTEN SAY JOEY, HUSH UP AND TAKE SOME QUESTIONS.",

         "Well, thank you, Special Agent Dawson. It is an honor to be here with you, with so many extraordinary, courageous Americans. To Senator Ted Cruz, thank you for your great leadership and support. Congressman Brady, Congressman Crenshaw, Lieutenant Governor Patrick , but most especially, to all of the courageous men and women of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement: Thank you for your service. We are proud of you and we are with you. (Applause.) And as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine who is a great admirer of the extraordinary men and women of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, who has been a champion of the rule of law and supporter of all of those who enforce our immigration laws , I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The President asked me to be here today among all of you , who he likes to call 'incredible people' , just to, first and foremost, say thank you. Thank you for your service. Thank you for the difference that you make in the life of our nation and the way you advance the safety and security of this community here in Houston, the state of Texas, and the nation as whole. Your leadership, your courageous service makes a difference every single day. It is remarkable to think: Sixteen years in the making, this agency has served the United States with great distinction and great courage. Twenty thousand American patriots like those of you gathered here comprise this organization. And in 2018 alone, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents and officers made more than 34,000 criminal arrests , the most in any single year. And America is safer because of ICE. (Applause.) Together, ICE agents removed 3,600 gang members from our streets, including 900 criminals affiliated with MS-13. You seized nearly 10,000 pounds of opioids before they could make their way to our communities large and small and tear at the very fabric of families and deliver hardship and heartache to families all across this nation. You know, the heartbreak that never happens, the crimes that never happen, never make it in the paper. But I want to assure you that this President, his Vice President, these extraordinary public officials who are here with us today know that, every day, ICE makes Houston and Texas and America safer. And you have our gratitude and our thanks. (Applause.) Now, unfortunately the field offices in Texas are some of the busiest in the country and we understand that. And I want to let you all know that we couldn't be more proud of the efforts that all of you make in a challenging environment. Some 1,200 miles of the southern border here in Texas , and, in the midst of a crisis on our southern border, the challenges are greater than ever. And , but you all have stepped up and done extraordinary work. I want to say we're particularly proud of your colleagues, just this week, in the Dallas office of ICE Homeland Security Investigations , arrested more than 280 people in the largest worksite operation at a single site in the last 10 years, upholding the laws of our land. So our thanks to the Dallas office. (Applause.) But here in Houston, the record is equally remarkable. In 2018, you arrested more than 14,000 illegal aliens, including more than 13,000 with criminal records. Your fugitive operations team focused on cases involving gangmembers, sex offenders, violent criminals; and, in 2018, arrested more than a thousand illegal aliens who posed a serious threat to national security and the safety of our nation. In fact, I'm told, just last week, ERO Houston arrested an illegal alien who's wanted for homicide in the Honduras. And the people of Houston and Texas are safer as a result of even that single apprehension. And not to be outdone, Homeland Security Investigations has already distinguished itself as well here in Houston. I'm told HSI Houston initiated more than 1,200 criminal investigations last year, resulting in the arrest of more than 1,300 human traffickers, drug smugglers, and gang members. So thank you to HIS Houston as well for the extraordinary work that you've done. (Applause.) The stories are too many to tell, but I like to tell a few of them. (Laughter.) We're joined today by a Special Agent, an online undercover agent for HSI. I'm told that he's one of the best. He's working on investigating child exploitation and human trafficking. And we just heard from one of your distinguished members of Congress that Texas, tragically , Texas, tragically, has become , and this city has become a hub of the vile trade of human trafficking and sex trafficking. This Special Agent is routinely called on for expert support by law enforcement agencies all across Texas and all across America. So would you join me in thank Special Agent Heath Hardwick? Where are you, Heath? (Applause.) Thank you for your work. Great job. Heath does more to help lock up criminals who exploit children and vulnerable families each and every day. And we couldn't be more proud, also, of your efforts to educate , to educate students and parents and teachers about how to protect our kids in the digital age. Well done. We're also joined by a deportation officer and program officer. I'm told the person first aspired to become a doctor. Went to medical school in Mexico 40 years ago, but then discovered a passion for wearing the uniform of law enforcement. As one former supervisor said, for more than three decades, he's treated every assignment like it's the most important work. And that's a work ethic that I know drives this office every single day. Join me in thanking Rogelio Gutierrez for an outstanding job protecting our community. Where are you, Rogelio? (Applause.) Great job. We could go on, and, frankly, I know we could name everybody in this room. And it'd be my honor to do it. But just know that, in recognizing these two extraordinary agents, that we're recognizing each and every one of you for the work that you do and the risks that you take each and every day. And the American people and the people of Texas deserve to know that, as you serve selflessly, as you consider our lives more important than your own, the truth of the matter is, this is a very challenging time for people in ICE. Across the country and even here in Texas, the heroes of ICE have been targeted not only by protests but by online harassment. ICE officers and leadership have had their personal information shared and social media. That's led to threats against you and your families. It's truly extraordinary. Now let me be clear: The American people have every right to engage in peaceful protests. But the threats and attempts to intimidate ICE officers and their families must stop, and they must stop right now. (Applause.) The sad fact is that your job is more challenging than ever. That's the reason I'm here in Texas today; it's the reason President Trump is in California today, because we want you to know that we're with you. You saw this President take strong measures, working with these members of Congress, to secure funding to end the crisis of illegal immigration on our southern border. But you all see the headlines as much as any other American does. You all live it here in these offices and in your assignments every day. You don't need me to tell you we've got a crisis of illegal immigration on our southern border and it's different than anything that we've ever seen before. For the first time in the history of this country, the majority of people , some 4,000 in a single day last week , the majority of people coming across our southern border are families and unaccompanied minors who are being enticed to make the long and dangerous journey north by drug cartels and human traffickers who would exploit them and exploit the loopholes in our laws. And now, here, the Houston office and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement is dealing with a wave not only of the people that are coming across the border that we apprehend that make a claim for asylum to try and gain entry into our country to exploit programs in our laws like catch and release that allow people to apply for asylum and then disappear into America that you all know better than me , it's not just the people that we stop at our border. It's the people that we're not stopping as we deal with an avalanche of families and vulnerable children coming across our southern border. You saw the President of the United States take action. We stood strong in the Congress of the United States and President Trump declared a national emergency. And we have secured the funding and have already started to build new wall on the southern border of the United States. (Applause.) The President will be reviewing some of that , those new structures in Calexico today. But you all know , in Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and at HSI, you know it's not just about infrastructure on our border. We also secured resources to support your work , additional personnel and additional bed space. But I must tell you: The President's declaration of a national emergency has made resources available and we're putting them to good use. And I want to take this opportunity specifically to thank Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Cornyn, Congressmen Brady and Crenshaw. Thank you for standing for border security. Thank you for standing with President Donald Trump to end the crisis of illegal immigration. (Applause.) But I am here today to tell you that we've only , we've only begun this fight. We're going to build the wall. We're going to secure our border in new and in renewed ways. We're going to provide you with the resources we need. But you all know that Congress also has to act. The loopholes in our law that are known as catch and release; the loopholes in our law that do not allow us to return unaccompanied minors to their home countries in Central America the way that we can in Mexico; the very nature of the structure of our legal system is being exploited by human traffickers and it's creating suffering on both sides of our border. I mean, make no mistake about it: These vulnerable families in El Salvador and Honduras and Guatemala are being exploited by human traffickers. They take hard cash , American currency , and then take them on the long and dangerous journey north, exploiting them physically along the way. You all know the statistics better than me about the condition that, particularly, young women arrive in when they arrive at our border. And so, we stand here today to say: We're with you. We're grateful for you every single day. But we also stand here today, with these members of Congress at our side, to say: It is time for Congress to act. It is time for Congress to come together and close the loopholes and end this crisis of illegal immigration on our southern border. (Applause.) You're doing your job. It's time they did theirs. (Applause.) So thank you all for being here today. I look forward to meeting as many of you as time permits, but I wanted you know that you not only have the respect of the President of the United States and his Vice President, but, as reflected here in these other officials, I just want to assure you: You have the respect of the American people. The American people are grateful for the work that that ICE does every day. We're grateful for the service of our teams at Homeland Security. We know the work you every day makes our families safer, our communities safer. And so I want to urge you on with confidence of that support and confidence of a grateful nation standing with you and standing beside you. And I also want to urge you on just with a prayer. You know, Congressman Crenshaw made a point in our last meeting. He said, 'You know, it's ' , he's someone who has worn the uniform, been in harm's way , like many of you have as well. And frankly, many of you are every day in your current positions. It's important to remember the risks that you take. You don't dwell on them, your families don't think of them any more than they have to, but we know you take risks. The congressman just said that, 'For people that have ever gone through the door not knowing what's on the other side, I can't fully understand the challenges that you face.' And so while I want you to know that we're going to continue to work to give you the resources and support and the respect that you deserve, we're going to call on the Congress to close the loopholes that are making your job even more challenging every day, I want you to know that you also go with the prayers of the American people and with our prayer. As the Old Book says, that 'His faithfulness will be your shield and your rampart' as you serve. May it be so that you do not fear the terror of the night, or the arrow that flies by day; that no harm will ever overtake you, as you make him your refuge. So we pray. So to the men and women of ICE, the men and women of Homeland Security: On behalf of the President of the United States, these great Texas officials, and your Vice President, thank you for your service. We are with you every step of the way, and we will stay with you until we end this crisis of illegal immigration and fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Thank you all very much, and God bless you. (Applause.)",

         "Thank you, Vice Admiral Lewis, for that kind introduction and those inspiring words. And thank you, sailors. At ease. You may be seated. To Captain Dienna, Captain Snowden, Command Master Chief Carter, to the extraordinary men and women who serve on this ship: It is my great honor to join you aboard America's Lone Warrior, the USS Harry S. Truman, where for more than 20 years you've been 'giving 'em hell' on every deployment. (Applause.) And it's especially great to return to the Truman. You know, I first set foot on this great ship just over 16 years ago, when my wife and I had the privilege of visiting with courageous sailors of this ship when it was deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. We arrived on a COD aircraft. I walked on today. (Laughter.) I preferred coming here on the COD, if you're taking notes. So thanks again for the warm welcome back. And as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine and a great supporter of all of the men and women who wear the uniform of our armed forces. I bring greetings from your Commander-in-Chief and the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) It really is an honor to stand before all of you here at the largest naval base in the world, to stand before men and women who stepped forward to serve in our all-volunteer Navy, to serve in a cause greater than yourselves, and to consider others' lives more important than your own. It is the noble calling, and you've answered the call in the cause of freedom, and you have the respect and gratitude of the American people. As we gather here today to honor what all of you do in the defense of freedom, I know our hearts and the hearts of the American people are elsewhere in this hemisphere, as well with the people of Venezuela as they take to the streets at this very hour in Operation Libertad. As we stand here today aboard this ship, the people of Venezuela are seeking to reclaim freedom and democracy in their nation , a nation impoverished by dictatorship, socialism, and oppression. And so we say to President Juan Guaid�, to all the freedom-loving people of Venezuela: Estamos con ustedes , we are with you. And America will stand with you in this hemisphere of freedom until your democracy is restored. (Applause.) And to the freedom-loving people of Venezuela, we say: As you stand for freedom, we stand with you. Vayan con Dios , go with God. It is an honor to be with all of you today. The United States Navy is the greatest force for good the Seven Seas have ever known. (Applause.) And President Trump asked me to be here today to pay a debt of gratitude and a debt of honor to each of you who have answered the call to serve and stand in defense of this nation, above and below these decks every day. As President Trump said in our first year in office, in his words, 'American sailors are the best warfighting sailors anywhere in the world our carriers are the centerpiece of American military might overseas.' (Applause.) You know, I couldn't be more proud to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and who fights every day on behalf of those who fight for us. You know, after the last administration depleted our military through constant budget cuts, I'm pleased to report to all of you gathered here that President Trump has taken decisive action to rebuild our military, and we are restoring the arsenal of democracy. (Applause.) Last year, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan and called for the building of 350 ship Navy. And we are on our way. (Applause.) In fact, just a few months ago, your Commander-in-Chief proposed the largest defense budget in American history , some $750 billion , to ensure that the strongest fighting force in the history of the world is stronger still. And the President's budget for shipbuilding is the largest shipbuilding request in more than 20 years. (Applause.) The President's budget request would give the United States Navy the resources to buy 12 new battle force ships. We'll fund 55 ships over the Future Years Defense Program, and we'll bring the United States Navy to 355 battle force ships by 2034. (Applause.) And I'm pleased to report the President's budget has given the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States not only the respect that you deserve every day, but the resources. This President signed the largest pay increase for men and women of our armed forces in more than 10 years. (Applause.) And you deserve every single penny. And you can know with confidence that, under President Trump's leadership, we will always give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the support you need to accomplish your mission and come home safe. And our historic investments in our military have already had a critical impact here in the Hampton Roads area. Under President Trump's leadership, Hampton Roads saw three additional vessels homeported here, compared with two years ago. And the largest Navy installation population got even bigger, growing by more than 25,000 families. And while it is very secondary to our national defense, the economic impact of the Navy in this region grew by more than $13 billion. That's more than $600 million of investment in this local economy in Norfolk and in Virginia than just one year ago , promoting prosperity and jobs and support for all of your families. (Applause.) My fellow Americans, I'm also pleased to report to you that that economic growth is not unusual these days, despite what some have been saying lately. Thanks to President Trump's leadership, the American economy is soaring. Over the last two years, businesses large and small have created 5.5 million new jobs, and there are more Americans working today than ever before in American history. This economy is roaring, and America is back. (Applause.) The truth is, the nation that you defend is more prosperous today than ever before. And the peace that you secure is making possible unprecedented growth. And every American is grateful for your service in defense of our freedom, in defense of our nation. You know, it really is an honor to be back aboard the Truman. And looking out at all of you and your shining faces is incredibly inspiring. You all serve this country with great distinction. There's a lot of stories to tell about the people who have served on this ship , past, present, and future , but let me acknowledge a couple of crew members before I leave. Petty Officer Lamont Sewell , where are you? , from Chester, Pennsylvania. Where are you, Lamont? Since joining the United States Navy 18 years ago, Petty Officer Sewell has grown into one of the most skilled aviation support equipment technicians here at Norfolk. He is an incredible sailor. Would you join me in congratulating the Truman's 2018 Sailor of the Year, Petty Officer Lamont Sewell? Great job. (Applause.) We're also joined by another Petty Officer from the Bronx, New York. Throughout her career in the Navy, including her current role as a logistics specialist here aboard the Truman, she's actually consistently upheld the highest levels of professionalism and leadership. And I'm sure it was no surprise to all of you when she was named the Petty Officer of the Year. And let me see if I can , where is Petty Officer Gonzalez at? Let's give her a big round of applause. (Applause.) Great job. Great job. These are just a couple of examples of sailors who have gone above and beyond the call of duty. So I'm grateful that you've joined me in showing your appreciation for their excellence. It's really emblematic what all of you do here each and every day. And the truth is, I have no doubt that these sailors are emblematic of each and every one of you and the service that you provide. But let me also say, as we give credit where credit is due, I know for many of you, you do not serve alone. Mrs. Pence was at Norfolk just a couple of short weeks ago acknowledging the families that are behind our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard. So, how about a big round of applause for the Navy families that are out there , (applause) , and the wonderful spouses and kids that support you each and every day? (Applause.) I know, for so many of you, you couldn't do it , you just couldn't do it without the support of the folks at home, without the spouse, without the encouragement of your kids, without your proud parents. And we remember them today. For more than 20 years, the USS Truman and its crew have played a vital role in defending our nation and protecting our interests across the globe. And it's humbling for me to stand among all of you that have continued that tradition. This ship has served as a constant sign to the world that we will always ensure our security and we will always stand for peace through strength. During each deployment in its prolific career, the USS Truman has taken the fight , taken the fight to the enemy on our terms, on their soil, particularly when it comes to the battle against radical Islamist terrorism. The USS Truman launched over 2,000 sorties throughout the Middle East in the last year alone. And the 7,500 sailors who serve in the Truman's Carrier Strike Group played an essential part in crippling ISIS, bombarding their territory, I'm told with nearly 1,600 precision munitions, the most of any U.S. Strike Group. And now the ISIS caliphate's territory is no more. Job well done, Truman. (Applause.) The Truman has also been there to provide desperately needed relief to Americans suffering in the wake of natural disasters and tragedies, including the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. I'm told the crew of this ship delivered meals, clean water, and other vital supplies to those whose lives were torn apart in that devastating storm. And just last year, this ship helped revolutionize naval warfare when it became the first carrier to deploy under Dynamic Force Employment. This new approach will make our Navy 'strategically predictable, but operationally unpredictable,' ensuring that our readiness and long-term reliability never undermine our security. As part of that deployment, the Truman made history and participated in Trident Juncture, the largest NATO military exercise since the fall of the Berlin Wall. It involved some 14,000 American troops, 29 NATO members. And last year, this ship became the first American carrier to operate within the Arctic Circle in more than two decades. Job well done. You showed the U.S. Navy stands ready to defend America's interests anywhere in the world. (Applause.) You know, this history and these achievements are a testament , a testament to your professionalism, the professionalism that each one of you shows every day. It's inspiring to see. It's a testament to your dedication, your leadership, and the remarkable efficiency and command readiness. I'm told, last year, actually, the USS Truman was awarded the 'Battle E,' which is given to the ship that demonstrates the highest level of performance of any carrier on the East Coast. Give yourselves a round of applause. (Applause.) That's just a sign of excellence and commitment that's making our nation safer. I'm here to tell you that President Trump and I are proud of the Truman. In fact, I met with the President at the White House this morning, and I told him I was going to be with all of you here on the deck of the Truman. And I can assure you the President and I understand the importance of the work that you do every day. And I know that I speak on behalf of all the American people when I say that we couldn't be more proud and we couldn't be more grateful for your patriotism and your selflessness. And as I stand before you today, I know that the future of this aircraft carrier is the subject of some budget discussions in Washington, D.C. And as we continue to fight Congress to make sure that our military has the resources you need to accomplish your mission, President Donald Trump asked me to deliver a message to each and every one of you on the deck of the USS Truman: We are keeping the best carrier in the world in the fight. We are not retiring the Truman. (Applause.) The USS Harry S. Truman is going to be 'giving 'em hell' for many more years to come. (Applause.) You know, the ship you serve aboard bears a proud and noble name. It's a man who distinguished himself as an artillery officer in World War I. He answered the call to public service. He served in the United States Senate, was a Vice President, and then President of the United States of America. But throughout his life, Harry S. Truman was tried and tested, and he always met the challenge , just like all of you. Through adversity, his greatness emerged. And history now records the enormous contributions that President Harry S. Truman made to the life of this nation. You all have been tested, as well, during your service here aboard the ship that bears his name. And you've shown your greatness as well. So to all of you who serve here aboard the USS Harry S. Truman, this Vice President has a simple word for you: Thank you for your service. And I urge you to press on. Maintain the standards of excellence that are synonymous with this ship throughout its more than 20-year history. Be vigilant. Mind your mission. Take care of one another. The American people are counting on you. You know, my life never took me into the uniform of the United States, but I'm the proud son of a combat veteran from the Korean War, and I'm the proud father of an aviator in the United States Marine Corps. In fact, just last year, as his mother and I were awaiting word, our son did his first capture aboard an aircraft carrier. I think we were more nervous than he was. (Laughter.) The truth of the matter is, we were confident not so much in his abilities, but in the people that had trained him; the people on that deck that were looking after him as they called the ball and made his way in. So let me just close today with a word of gratitude on behalf of all the parents around America who appreciate what you do, appreciate the way you look after our sailors, our airmen, and all those who serve on this ship, who come and go into harm's way from this place and sail with you into harm's way. We all know that your service comes with sacrifice for you, for your families. And I want you to know that as you serve and as you sail, you do not go alone. You carry with you the strength and the pride and the confidence of the American people.And you also carry with you one more thing, and that is the prayers of millions of Americans who carry each one of you before the throne of grace every day, who pray for your families and for your mission, for your safety, and for your success. And I pray that as you sail and as you serve, you would do so with confidence and with faith yourself. And as the Old Book tells us, 'If rise on the wings of the dawn if go up to the heavens even there hand will guide and right hand will hold fast.' And you do not go alone. As I look out across this deck today, I see men and women who have answered the call to put on the uniform of the United States of America, the greatest nation in the history of the world. And I know, as long as we have men and women of courage and selflessness, like all of you gathered here; as long as we have heroes willing to put the lives on the line for our freedom; as long as we have patriots like all of you, we will protect this nation. We will defend our freedom. We will forge a future of security, and prosperity, and peace for ourselves and our posterity. God bless the crew of the USS Harry S. Truman as you sail on in defense of America. Thank you. And God bless you. (Applause.)",

         "GOOD AFTERNOON. ON THE EVE OF THE 57TH MARCH ON WASHINGTON, I WILL SPEAK ABOUT RECENT EVENTS IN KENOSHA, WISCONSIN, WILDFIRES RAGING ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA COAST TOMORROW , AND ROCKY MOUNTAIN. THE STORM WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH TEXAS, LOUISIANA, AND THE GULF COAST, AND MOST OF ALL, WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. WE ARE A NATION AT ITS BEST LOVES, PROTECTS, AND HELPS FELLOW AMERICANS. TODAY, WE SEE PAIN, HURT, AND DESTRUCTION. WE ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO CONTINUE FOLLOWING GUIDANCE FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO STAY SAFE. JOE AND I PLEDGE TO BE THERE FOR THOSE WHOSE LIVES WERE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. THOSE WHO NEED HELP FROM NEIGHBORS, STRANGERS, AND OUR GOVERNMENT TO MAKE IT THROUGH, TO RESTORE YOUR LIVES AND COMMUNITY. WE ALSO SEE PAIN, HURT, AND DESTRUCTION IN THE AFTERMATH OF YET ANOTHER BLACK MAN SHOT BY POLICE. JACOB BLAKE SHOT SEVEN TIMES IN THE BACK IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS THREE YOUNG SONS. SEVEN TIMES, IN THE BACK, IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS THREE YOUNG SONS. AS VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN PUT IT, THE SHOTS FIRED AT MR. BLAKE PIERCED THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. IT IS SICKENING TO WATCH. IT IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR. IT MUST END. THANKFULLY, HE IS ALIVE TODAY BUT HE IS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE WHEN HE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE. MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE FAMILY AS THEY ENDURE THE ORDEAL THAT IS TRAGICALLY COMMON IN OUR COUNTRY. JOE AND I SPOKE WITH THEM YESTERDAY. THEY ARE AN AMAZING GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE, EVEN AS THEY SEEK JUSTICE FOR THEIR SON, THEY SPOKE ABOUT THE NEED TO END THE VIOLENCE AND HEAL OUR NATION. I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH FAR TOO MANY MOTHERS AND FATHERS. YOU WILL SEE AND HEAR NO ONE WITH MORE COURAGE, MORE CHARACTER, AND MORE MORAL CLARITY. PEOPLE ARE RIGHTFULLY ANGRY AND EXHAUSTED. AFTER THE MURDERS OF RIHANNA, AND SO MANY OTHERS, IT IS NO WONDER PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS. I SUPPORT THEM. WE MUST ALWAYS DEFEND PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. WE SHOULD NOT CONFUSE THEM WITH LOOTING AND COMMITTING ACTS OF VIOLENCE, INCLUDING THE SHOOTER, WHO WAS ARRESTED FOR MURDER. MAKE NO MISTAKE. WE WILL NOT LET VIGILANTES AND EXTREMISTS DERAIL THE PATH TO JUSTICE. HERE IS MY PROMISE TO THOSE MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND THOSE WHO STAND WITH THEM. A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION, YOU WILL HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE, IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS, AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE ALL GREW UP CITING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE BUT NOW, WE MUST GIVE REAL MEETING , MEANING TO HIS WORDS. ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE, FOR ALL. JUSTICE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. THE REALITY IS THAT THE LIFE OF A BLACK PERSON IN AMERICA HAS NEVER BEEN TREATED AS FULLY HUMAN. WE HAVE YET TO FULFILL THE PROMISE OF EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. WE WILL ONLY ACHIEVE THAT WHEN WE FINALLY COME TOGETHER TO PASS MEANINGFUL POLICE REFORM AND BROADER CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND ACKNOWLEDGE AND ADDRESS SYSTEMIC RACISM. WE WILL ONLY COME CLOSER TO ACHIEVING THAT WHEN WE FINALLY COME TOGETHER. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY TOWARD BUILDING A PERFECT UNION BUT THE TIME IS NOW TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP FORWARD. EVEN AS THEY WE HAVE A RECKONING WITH RACIAL INJUSTICE, WE MUST ALSO CONFRONT ANOTHER CRISIS. THE PANDEMIC THAT HAS TORN APART SO MANY LIVES. WE CANNOT LOOK THE OTHER WAY OR ALLOW OURSELVES TO SUCCUMB TO THEM. NEARLY 6 MILLION CONFIRMED CASES OF THE CORONAVIRUS. 180,000 LIVES LOST. MORE THAN 50 MILLION CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT THIS YEAR ALONE. WE NEED TO SEE AND HEAR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY. HOPING FOOD BANKS HAVE SOMETHING LEFT WHEN THEY GET TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE. THE 50-YEAR-OLD STORE MANAGER WHO HAS BEEN LAID OFF AND KNOWS HE CANNOT PAY THE RENT AND THE FIRST OF THE MONTH. MOTHERS AND FATHERS STRETCHED TO THE BREAKING POINT, WORKING FROM HOME, WHILE HELPING THEIR KIDS WITH ONLINE CLASSES. TRYING TO HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER. ECONOMIC ENGINES OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE SHUTTING THEIR DOORS EVERY DAY. THE NURSE, GETTING READY FOR HER AFTERNOON SHIFT, GIVEN SO MUCH SUFFERING AND DEATH IN RECENT MONTHS, WONDERS HOW MUCH MORE SHE COULD BEAR TO WITNESS. THE FAMILY GRIEVING THE LOSS OF THEIR MOTHER. COULD NOT EVEN VISIT IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF HER LIFE. THE ALARMING AND DISPROPORTIONATE RATE AT WHICH BLACKS AND LATINOS AND INDIGENOUS FAMILIES ARE CONTRACTING AND DYING OF COVID-19. THAT IS THE REALITY NOW. A REALITY COMPLETELY ABSENT FROM THIS WEEK'S REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. UNLIKE THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION, WHICH WAS VERY CLEAR I'D ABOUT THE CHALLENGE WE WERE FACING AND HOW TO TACKLE THEM, THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IS DESIGNED FOR ONE PURPOSE. TO SOOTH DONALD TRUMP'S EGO. TO MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD. HERE'S THE THING. HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT HIM. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BY THAT MEASURE, DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENCY. HE THINKS IT IS ABOUT HIM. IT IS NOT. IT IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US. THE PEOPLE. I WOULD SAY THE FOLLOWING WORDS. KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY A STAND TODAY TO SPEAK FOR THE PEOPLE. WE KNOW THE TRUTH. DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED AT THE MOST BASIC JOB OF THE UNITED STATES. HE FAILED TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. TRUMP SHOWED THAT WE IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION WOULD CALL A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE DANGER A PANDEMIC WOULD PROPOSE FOR AMERICAN LIVES, FOR THE DEVASTATION IT WOULD DO TO OUR , TO OUR ECONOMY. FOR THE DAMAGE IT WOULD DO TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO STRUCTURAL RACISM FOR GENERATIONS. FOR THE CHAOS THAT WOULD UPEND OUR DAILY LIVES, MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR CHILDREN TO GO TO SCHOOL. HE NEVER APPRECIATED A PRESIDENT SWEARS AN OATH BEFORE GOD AND COUNTRY TO PROTECT AMERICA AGAINST THREATS SEEN AND UNSEEN. IT IS HIS DUTY, IT IS HIS OBLIGATION TO PROTECT US. AND YET HE HAS FAILED, MISERABLY. HERE IS THE THING. DONALD TRUMP'S INCOMPETENCE IS NOTHING NEW. THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON FULL DISPLAY. IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, IT BECAME DEADLY. THAT IS WHEN THE THREAT OF A VIRUS THAT WOULD ENDANGER THE WORLD FIRST EMERGED. TRUMP DISMISSED THE THREAT, BUT JOE BIDEN SOUNDS THE ALARM. IT WOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A PATTERN THAT PERSISTS TO THIS DAY. TRUMP TELLING US NOT TO WORRY, THAT THE VIRUS WILL DISAPPEAR, THAT A MIRACLE IS COMING. JOE BIDEN SAYING WE NEED A PLAN, IN NATIONAL STRATEGY, A PRESIDENT WHO IS WILLING TO LEAD , WILLING TO BE A ROLE MODEL FOR OUR NATION, FOR OUR CHILDREN. TRUMP STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN. HE STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN. JOE BIDEN RELEASED HIS FIRST PLAN IN MARCH. AND HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE PANDEMIC. IT IS RELENTLESS. YOU CANNOT STOP IT WITH A TWEET. YOU CANNOT CREATE A DISTRACTION AND HOPE IT WILL GO AWAY. IT DOES NOT GO AWAY. BY ITS NATURE, IT PANDEMIC IS UNFORGIVING. IF YOU GET IT WRONG AT THE BEGINNING, THE CONSEQUENCES ARE CATASTROPHIC. IT IS VERY HARD TO CATCH UP AND YOU DO NOT GET A SECOND CHANCE. PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT IT WRONG FROM THE BEGINNING. THEN HE GOT IT WRONG AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC. HERE IS WHY TRUMP HAS BEEN SO UNWILLING AND UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THE CRISIS. HE WAS ON FIXATING , FIXING THE PROBLEM. HE SAID IT WOULD HURT THE MARKET AND HURT HIS CHANCES OF BEING REELECTED. THAT MATTERED TO HIM MORE THAN SAVING AMERICAN LIVES. RIGHT AT THE MOMENT WE NEEDED DONALD TRUMP TO BE TOUGH ON THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, HE CAVED. ON JANUARY 24, HE PRAISED THE PIT , THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. HE SAID CHINA HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TO DETAIN THE CORONAVIRUS. THE UNITED STATES GREATLY AND , APPRECIATES THEIR EFFORTS AND TRANSPARENCY AND IT WILL ALL END WELL. THEY BLOCKED PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTORS FROM OUR CDC INNING ACCESS AND INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES. DONALD TRUMP STOOD IDLY BY AND IT WAS A DEADLY DECISION. DONALD TRUMP FROZE. HE WAS SCARED. AND HE WAS PETTY AND FIGMENT IT , AND VINDICTIVE. HE TOLD THEM IT WAS NOT HIS JOB TO GIVE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO FRONTLINE WORKERS. HE SAYS, 'RESPIRATORS, VENTILATORS, ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT, TRY GETTING IT YOURSELVES.' ON THAT DAY WE HAVE , TODAY, WE HAVE NEARLY 6 MILLION. EVEN NOW, DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND WILL NOT ACT. THE TRAGEDY IN ALL OF THIS IS IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. JUST LOOK AROUND. IT IS NOT LIKE THIS AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. ALL WE NEEDED, GUYS, ALL WE NEEDED WAS A COMPETENT PRESIDENT. ONE WHO IS WILLING TO LISTEN. WILLING TO LEAD. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, HAVE A PLAN. DO THEIR JOBS. JOE BIDEN WILL BE THAT PRESIDENT. HE HAS GOT A NATIONAL STRATEGY. HE IS MORE THAN READY TO LEAD. EVERY MONTH SINCE MARCH, AS THE PANDEMIC HAS UNFOLDED, JOE BIDEN HAS UPDATED STEPS HE WOULD TAKE TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES AND HE HAS DONE IT BASED ON WHAT EVERY SCIENTIST, EXPERT, AND ECONOMIST SAYS WE SHOULD BE DOING. JOE BIDEN WILL PUT A PLAN INTO EFFECT ON DAY ONE, DEPLOY RAPID TESTS WITH IMMEDIATE RESULTS, MAKE SURE TREATMENTS AND ULTIMATELY, A VACCINE, REACH ALL AMERICANS, INCLUDING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, WHICH HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LEFT BEHIND. MANUFACTURER THE EQUIPMENT WE NEED AND MAKE THEM RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA SO WE ARE NEVER AGAIN AT THE MERCY OF CHINA AND OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE. JOE AND I WILL MAKE SURE SCHOOLS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE OPEN AND SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. PUT POLITICS ASIDE AND NOT SILENCE THE EXPERTS SO PUBLIC GETS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED AND DESERVE. AND PUT IN PLACE A NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATE. IT IS NOT A BURDEN TO PROTECT EACH OTHER. HE SAYS THAT BECAUSE THE THING ABOUT JOE IS, HE KNOWS WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. DONALD TRUMP SAYS THERE IS NOTHING HE COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT ALL OF THIS DEATH. BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN HAD A PROGRAM CALLED PROTECT. THE PROGRAM TRACKED EMERGING DISEASES IN PLACES LIKE CHINA. TRUMP CUT IT. THEY CREATED THAT TEAM IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, DEDICATING THEM TO THE WORK IN BIO DEFENSE. THEY IMPLEMENTED STANZEL , STANDARDS TO IMPROVE INFECTION CONTROL. DONALD TRUMP IS ERASING THEM. BEFORE THE VIRUS HIT, TRUMP MADE US VULNERABLE. HE FAILED TO DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY. AS IT CONTINUES, HE IS MAKING IT WORSE EVERY DAY. JUST THIS WEEK, THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION SAID A CUT TO SOCIAL SECURITY LIKE THE ONE TRUMP IS PROPOSING WOULD END DISABILITY BENEFITS WITHIN ONE YEAR. AND ALL BENEFITS WITHIN THREE YEARS. LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE. IF DONALD TRUMP'S EXTREME PROPOSAL GOES INTO EFFECT, THE CHECKS THAT AMERICAN SENIORS ARE RELYING ON, THAT YOU RELY ON, TO PAY YOUR BILLS, TO BUYER MEDICINE, TO LIVE, WILL STOP COMING. THE VERY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY IN THIS CRISIS, IT IS UNTHINKABLE. IN THE MIDDLE OF A HEALTH CRISIS MADE WORSE BY HIS OWN ACTIONS, DONALD TRUMP IS IN COURT RIGHT NOW, TRYING TO THROW OUT THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, INCLUDING PROTECTIONS IT PROVIDES FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THAT MEANS IF YOU ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SURVIVE COVID-19, INSURERS COULD DENY YOU COVERAGE FOR TREATING ANY LONG-TERM EFFECTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NOT TELL YOU ANY OF THIS AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION TONIGHT. WE ALL KNOW HE IS NOT CHANGING. THE PRESIDENT HE HAS BEEN IS THE PRESIDENT HE WILL BE. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO RIGHT THESE WRONGS AND PUT AMERICA ON A BETTER PATH FORWARD. LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS AND FOLLOW THE BEST MEDICAL GUIDANCE TO KEEP US AND KEEP FAMILIES SAFE. ONE WHERE WE TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION AGAINST SYSTEMS AND TRADITIONS OF OPPRESSION. ONE WHERE WE STOP FANNING THE FLAMES OF HATE AND DIVISION AND TREAT ONE ANOTHER WITH THE RESPECT AND DIGNITY THAT EACH ONE OF US DESERVES. AS JOE BIDEN SAID, WE HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK. I BELIEVE AMERICA WILL CHOOSE THE LIGHT. THANK YOU.",

         "Thank you, Acting Secretary Shanahan, Secretary Mark Esper, Secretary Wilson, distinguished members of Congress, members of the Joint Chiefs, the leadership of the Armed Forces of the United States, and to all of you who wear the uniform of the United States of America. It is my honor to be with you here today at the Pentagon as our President unveils his vision for our renewed commitment to American missile defense. As Commander-in-Chief, President Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people. And it's, frankly, the greatest honor of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families. Today, along with all of you, our hearts and our prayers are with the families of the fallen American heroes who were lost in Syria yesterday, as well as those service members who were wounded. We honor their service and we will honor the memory of the fallen. And their families and our Armed Forces should know their sacrifice will only steel our resolve; that as we begin to bring our troops home, we will do so in a way that ensures that the remnants of ISIS will never be able to reestablish their evil and murderous caliphate. It's in that same spirit of resolve that we gather here today. Since day one of this administration, President Trump has taken decisive action to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. Working with members of Congress in both parties, we're rebuilding our military, restoring the arsenal of democracy. And last year, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the largest military pay raise in nearly a decade. At the President's direction, we released a National Security Strategy that puts America first, pursued the modernization of our nuclear arsenal. And President Trump has taken decisive action to extend American dominance on land, at sea, in air, and in cyberspace, and even called for the establishment of a sixth branch of our Armed Forces to ensure American dominance in space. In the last two years, our President has made great progress to provide for the common defense. And today, by unveiling our new strategy for missile defense, President Trump will take another critical step to ensure the safety and security of the American people and our very way of life. This President knows that the American people believe that America First begins with peace through strength. So now it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce your Commander-in-Chief, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.",

HE HAS INSULTED, DEMONIZED, THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY EMPATHY, COMPASSION. NO REGARD FOR THE VALUES THAT MADE THIS COUNTRY THE WAY WE ARE. NOT THE WAY YOU WERE RAISED BY YOUR MOM AND DAD. HE LACKS THE HONESTY, DECENCY AND RESPECT. HE USES IT AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS. HE DOES NOT BELIEVE WE ARE A BEACON OF THE WORLD. HE DOES NOT BELIEVE WE ARE ALL PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. THAT IS WHY I SAID THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCED THIS CANDIDACY, WE ARE LIVING IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. FOLKS, WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA, NOT SOWING SEEDS OF DIVISION AND ANGER AND HATE. WE HAVE GOT TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND WE WILL, BUT WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE HIM. WE CAN'T HAVE A NEVER ENDING WAR BETWEEN THE PARTIES. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN FIGHT. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, I CAN FIGHT. BUT LOOK, WE NEED AS BADLY, SOMEONE WHO CAN HEAL. WHEN WE PASSED OBAMACARE, WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I DID, SAVING THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, WHAT WE DID TO PASS THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, IT WAS NOT ENOUGH. IT WAS JUST A START. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN HEAL THE COUNTRY AS WELL. THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT. I PROMISE YOU. IT IS ABOUT DELIVERING REAL RESULTS FOR YOU, YOUR FAMILY, AND THE COMMUNITY. IT IS NOT ABOUT ME, JILL, OR VALERIE. IT IS ABOUT YOU, ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES. PARAPHRASING ROBERT BROWN. HE SAID, 'OUR REACH SHOULD EXCEED OUR GRASP.' THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND WE CAN GRASP WHAT EVER WE REACH FOR. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I QUOTE AN ENGLISH POET , LET ME CLICK A REAL POET NOW, AN IRISH POET. HE WROTE A POEM CALLED 'THE CURE OF TROY.' I BELIEVE THIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY BEING. HE SAID, HISTORY SAYS, DON'T HOPE ON THIS SIDE OF THE GRAVE, BUT THEN ONCE IN A LIFETIME, THE TIDAL WAVE OF JUSTICE RISES UP AND HOPE IN HISTORY RISE. WE CAN MAKE HOPE IN HISTORY RHYME.

WE LOSE FROM 700 TO 1000 PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY IN AMERICA, WORSE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. MORE THAN 7.5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN INFECTED AND WE ARE STILL COUNTING. IN NEVADA, THERE ARE MORE THAN 82,000 CASES. 80% OF THE DEATHS HAVE BEEN SENIORS OVER 60 YEARS OF AGE, BLACK, LATINO, NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ARE ESPECIALLY HIT HARD. NATIONALLY THE INFECTION RATE AMONG LATINOS IS NEARLY THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OF OTHER , MY HEART GOES OUT TO ALL THIS FAMILIES. THIS MORNING, THERE IS AN EMPTY CHAIR AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE AND WHEN YOU GO TO DINNER AT NIGHT THE PERSON WHO SHOULD BE THERE IS GONE. THEY HAVE LOST PART OF THEIR SOUL. THEY HAVE LOST PART OF THEIR LIFE. IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY. FOR YOU AND I, IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY. LOSING FAMILY IS A DEVASTATING THING. WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER. MY HEART GOES OUT TO EVERYONE STRUGGLING WITH THE ECONOMIC CRISIS CAUSED BY THE SIMPLE NEGLECT OF THIS PRESIDENT. NEARLY I'M , 11 MILLION JOBS LOST THE BEGINNING OF THIS CRISIS AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT COME BACK. TEMPORARY LAYOFFS HAVE TURNED TO PERMANENT LAYOFFS. RECORD GROWTH AND AMERICANS FACING LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE PROBLEM OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT, ONCE YOU GET PAST A CERTAIN POINT HISTORY TELLS US, THEY NEVER GET A JOB AGAIN. ALL TOLD THERE'S 30 MILLION WORKERS WHO HAVE LOST HOURS, LOST PAYCHECKS, OR LOST THEIR JOBS. YULIA 700,000 PEOPLE HAVE DROPPED OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE AND THE VAST MAJORITY WERE WOMEN . WE ARE STILL DOWN 600 47,000 JOBS IN MANUFACTURING NATIONWIDE SINCE THE CRISIS STARTED. HERE IN NEVADA THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 13.2%, THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NEGLIGENCE. THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY HAS BEEN HIT PARTICULARLY HARD. 50% OF THOSE MEMBERS ARE OUT OF WORK. TOURISM WENT DOWN 70% FROM A YEAR AGO. THE RESULT? PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY SINCE HOOVER TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS THAN WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE. HERE IN NEVADA, AFTER SEEING 200,000 JOBS CREATED IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OF THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, THEY HAVE SEEN JOBS GO DOWN UNDER THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. HE IS LEAVING US INTO WHAT HE CALLS A V-SHAPED RECESSION. IT IS A K-SHAPED RECESSION. FOR THOSE OF THE TOPIC KEEPS GOING. FOR THE MIDDLE LEFT US FOR THOSE AT THE TOP, IT KEEPS GOING UP. FOR THOSE AT THE BOTTOM, IT KEEPS GOING DOWN. IS THE MOST UNEQUAL RECOVERY IN MODERN HISTORY. IF YOU GET THIS , THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA HAVE DONE PRETTY WELL. JUST IN THE PANDEMIC, THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES HAVE MADE AN ADDITIONAL $3 BILLION. TOP 100. WHEN YOU GET TO THE BOTTOM HALF OF THAT K, IT'S A DOWNWARD SLIDE. YOU'RE LEFT TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU WILL PAY YOUR BILLS, PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. SO MUCH FOOD INSECURITY AND AMERICA. BECAUSE OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PRESIDENT, THE KIDS CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE HE HAS NOT PROVIDED THE WHEREWITHAL FOR SCHOOLS TO OPEN. YOU'RE ASKED TO RISK YOUR NET BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WORK FROM HOME. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE A POLICE OFFICER, A NURSE FOR YOU WORK ON AN ASSEMBLY LINE. IF YOU ARE A HOUSEKEEPER, A CASINO WORKER , GOVERNOR, YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO TURN THINGS AROUND. GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE BEEN FOCUSED AND RESPONSIBLE. YOU FOLLOWED SCIENCE AND PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST. YOU MAKE CALLS TO REOPEN SCHOOLS IN THE ECONOMY SAFELY. YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE DONE THE SAME. AND THE HOUSE PASSED WHAT THEY CALL THE HEROES ACT MONTHS AGO. WOULD HAVE PROVIDED ALIENS OF DOLLARS TO KEEP FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE JOB. BUT DONALD TRUMP AND MITCH MCCONNELL, THE REPUBLICAN LEADER, DID NOTHING TO MOVE THE LEGISLATION. NOTHING IN JUNE, NOTHING IN AUGUST, NOTHING IN SEPTEMBER. THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. AS PEOPLE STRUGGLE AND SUFFER, WHAT DO THEY FOCUS ON. IF THIS WERE NOT SO SERIOUS YOU WOULD THINK I WAS MAKING IT UP. WHAT DO THEY FOCUS ON? MORE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY. I'M NOT JOKING. HIS PROPOSAL HAS ANOTHER TAX CUT FOR MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES. CUTTING THE MEANS BY WHICH WE FIND THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, LEAVING THE ACTUARIES TO SAY IF THEY DO IT, BY MID-2023 THERE WILL BE NO MONEY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. AND THE RELENTLESS EFFORT TO ELIMINATE THE OF PORTABLE CARE ACT WHICH PROVIDES HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR 22 MILLION PEOPLE. , 20 BILLION PEOPLE, 100 MILLION WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. HE HAS ALREADY COST 10 MILLION PEOPLE FOR , THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE THE COMPANIES HAVE GONE BANKRUPT. IS UNCONSCIONABLE , IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE. HE'S TRYING TO TAKE YOUR HEALTH CARE AWAY. IT'S LITERALLY BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AS I SPEAK, TO STRIKE DOWN THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ONE HUNDRED 82,000 NEVADANS. , 182,000 NEVADANS. TAKE AWAY PROTECTION FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID COULD VERY WELL BE THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. TOSSING OUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT ALLOWS CHILDREN TO BE COVERED ON THEIR PARENTS' INSURANCE POLICY UNTIL AT LEAST 26, TAKING US BACKWARD WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD CHARGE A WOMAN MORE JUST BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN. TAKE AWAY MEDICARE BENEFITS FOR SENIORS, INCREASED DRUG PRESCRIPTION COSTS, AND JUST AS HE VOWED TO 'TERMINATE' THE FUNDING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. THE IDEA THAT IN JUST A FEW YEARS TO PUT AT RISK FOR HUNDRED 10,000 NEVADA TO RELY ON A DIGNIFIED RETIREMENT BECAUSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY , 410,000 NEVADANS WHO RELY ON A DIGNIFIED RETIREMENT BECAUSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY. NOT ONCE DID PRESIDENT TRUMP CALL A HIGH LEVEL MEETING OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES. I HAVE SERVED WITH A LOT OF PRESIDENTS. NEVER DID THEY FAIL TO TRY TO BRING PARTIES TOGETHER IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO REACH A SETTLEMENT. YOU KNOW WHY? HE SPENDS SO MUCH TIME HIDING IN THE BUNKER IN THE WHITE HOUSE, OR THE BUNKER OFF HIS GOLF COURSE, PLAYING HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS OF GOLF, AND THEN THIS TUESDAY, WHAT DID HE DO? HE SAID INTO THE DISCUSSIONS. HE WAS NOT EVEN STARTING THEM. NO MORE NEGOTIATIONS, NO MORE NEGOTIATIONS. AND TODAY HE SAYS, WELL, I'M BACK. DONALD TRUMP SHOWS NO URGENCY TO DELIVER HARD-WORKING AMERICANS, LIKE THE FAMILY I GREW UP IN AND LIKE ALL OF YOU, WHAT THEY NEED NOW, DESPERATELY. FOR EXACTLY TWO MONTHS SINCE THE EMERGENCY SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM THE CONGRESSPEOPLE VOTED FOR HAS CLOSE DOWN. TWO MONTHS OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN NEVADA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY WAITING AND HOPING FOR JUST A LITTLE EXTRA HELP TO STAY OPEN. NOW WE HAVE OVER 400,000 SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSED. MILLIONS MORE ARE STRUGGLING TO HANG ON. HOW MANY MORE WILL GO UNDER? MAKE NO MISTAKE, IF YOUR BUSINESS IS CLOSED, IF YOU ARE FACING EVICTION, OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS WORRY WHETHER THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE NEXT MONTH. NONE OF THAT SEEMS TO MATTER TO DONALD TRUMP. IF YOU ARE A FIREFIGHTER OR A POLICE OFFICER, HE HAS TURNED HIS BACK ON YOU AS WELL. WHEN BARACK AND I WERE ELECTED WE INHERITED THE WORST RECESSION SHORT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN HISTORY. WE PUT TOGETHER THE RECOVERY ACT. WE PUT TOGETHER IN 18 MONTHS TO PREVENT A RECESSION. I WAS ABLE TO SEE TO IT THAT THE STATES COULD KEEP MOVING, KEEP TEACHERS, FIRST RESPONDERS, FIREFIGHTERS MOVING. RIGHT HERE IN CLARK COUNTY I WAS ABLE TO BRING $1.2 BILLION TO KEEP YOUR ECONOMY GOING. WE HAVE THAT ABILITY NOW. THE HOUSE HAS ALREADY PASSED A SIMILAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND WE START THE LONGEST SUSTAINED RECOVERY IN AMERICAN HISTORY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL SAID ABOUT HELPING THE STATE? I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP. HE SAID, LET THEM GO BANKRUPT, LET THEM GO BANKRUPT. WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING ABOUT? WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE CAN CONTAIN THIS VIRUS AND FULLY REOPEN OUR ECONOMY. WE MAKE UP 4% OF THE WORLDS POPULATION AND WE HAVE 20% OF THE WORLD'S DEATHS. IF WE JUST FOLLOW THE SCIENCE, EXPANDED TESTING AND TRACING, SOCIAL DISTANCING, WASHING HER HANDS, NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATE , WASHING YOUR HANDS, NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATES. DON'T POLITICIZE THE RACE FOR A VACCINE, MR. PRESIDENT. JUST HAVE A PLAN FOR A SAFE AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION. HAVE A REAL PLAN AND THEN IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA I HAVE LAID OUT TO MAKE BOLD INVESTMENTS SO WE CAN LOOK BACK BETTER. HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS , SOME ARE IN SUPPORT OF ME. HE SAYS BIDEN IS GOING TO SPEND ALL THIS MONEY. MOODY DID A DETAILED ANALYSIS. MY ECONOMY WILL CREATE 18.6 MILLION JOBS, 7 MILLION MORE JOBS THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. YOU HAVE GOT TO GET THINGS DONE. THIS IS HOW MY PLAN IS , WORKS. IT IS NOT GOING TO RAISE UP HENNEY OF TAX. NOT A PENNY. HOW DO WE PAY FOR ALL THIS? I WOULD ASK THE CORPORATIONS AND THE WEALTHY TO START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. 92 DO NOT , 92 MILLION DO NOT PAY A PENALTY , A PENNY IN TALKING , AND TAXES. DONALD TRUMP PAID $720 IN TAXES? COME ON. THE MONEY WE RAISED BY LIMITING THE $1.3 TRILLION OF THE TAX CUTS THAT AFFECTS THE SUPER WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS, WE WILL GROW THE ECONOMY TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS INCLUDED ON THE DEAL. THE KINDS OF INVESTMENT THAT WILL STIMULATE THE ECONOMY,'S INCLUDING INDUSTRIES LIKE TOURISM. TO HELP THE ECONOMY BUILD BACK BETTER THAN BEFORE. IT MEANS CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS, MANUFACTURING AND SAID KNOWLEDGE HE, DUST TECHNOLOGY, MAKING SURE OUR FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA. WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE GIVES OUT $600 BILLION IN CONTRACTS FOR A YEAR, GUESS WHY? , GUESS WHAT? WHEN I AM PRESIDENT IT WILL GO TO KNOW OUTFIT THAT DOES NOT MAKE IT IN AMERICA AND SELL IT IN AMERICA. I MEAN IT. INFRASTRUCTURE, BUILDING ROADS, AIRPORTS, CLEAN ENERGY. WEATHERIZING 2 MILLION HOMES. CREATING AT LEAST A MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS, MAKING THE CLIMATE SAFER, SAVING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL. WE'LL DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE BY CREATING MILLIONS OF UNION JOBS. WE WILL FIGHT BACK STRONGER, THE MORE FREQUENT WILDFIRES. AND BY THE WAY. DID YOU HEAR WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID ABOUT HURRICANES THIS SUMMER? HE WAS TOLD HOW THEY WERE COMING ACROSS THE WARM WATER IN THE ATLANTIC AND THE CLOSER THEY GET TO THE SHORE THE WORST THEY GET. THAT'S THE WORST THEY GET , THE WORSE THEY GET. HE SAID MAYBE WE SHOULD DROP AN ATOMIC BOMB ON THEM. BLESS ME, FATHER, FOR I HAVE SENT. , FOR I HAVE SINNED. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE ANOTHER $100 BILLION IN LOW-INTEREST LOANS AVAILABLE FOR THESE BUSINESSES, CREATING JOB, INCREASING ECONOMIC GROWTH, INCREASING INCOMES. A $15 MINIMUM WAGE. A $15 MINIMUM WAGE FOR OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WE NOT JUST WENT TO PRAISE YOU. WE ARE GOING TO PAY YOU WITH A GOOD WAGE AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE STRONG BENEFIT. WE WILL BUILD THE , WE WILL CREATE SUBSIDIES TO INCREASE PLANS THAT WILL LOWER DEDUCTIBLES. IT IS A PLAN THAT WILL/, SLASH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. IF IN FACT MEDICARE IS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE FOR ALL THE DRUGS THEY BUY AND SAY, YOU WILL NOT SELL THEM UNLESS THEY PAY THE PRICE THEY ARE SUGGESTING, THAT WOULD DROP BY 60% THE COST OF DRUGS. WE WILL ALSO MAKE HIGH-QUALITY CHILD CARE ACCESSIBLE AND WORK WITH STATES TO ENSURE THAT EVERY THREE AND FOUR-YEAR-OLD WILL GET ACCESS TO A HIGH-QUALITY PRESCHOOL, NOT DAYCARE. WE WILL ENSURE THAT LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WILL NEVER HAVE TO SPEND MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. IF WE WANT TO REWARD WORK ON THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF FAMILIES CARING FOR A CHILD OR AN AGING LOVED ONE. FOR THE PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS OUT THERE, OFTEN WOMEN, WOMEN OF COLOR, IMMIGRANTS, TOO OFTEN UNDERPAID, UNDER SEEN, UNDERVALUED. THAT IS WHY MY PLAN WILL ELEVATE THE COMPENSATION FOR CAREGIVERS AND WE WILL TRIPLE THE FUNDING FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS LIKE THE ONE BEHIND ME. WE WILL MAKE FOUR YEARS OF PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE AND UNIVERSITY TUITION FREE FOR ANY FAMILY THAT MAKES LESS THAN $125,000 A YEAR. WE WILL MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE FOR AMERICA'S IT QUALIFY. AND IF YOU ARE BUYING YOUR FIRST HOME, WE WILL PROVIDE A 15 THOUSAND DOLLARS TAX CREDIT TO HELP YOU GET THERE. WE WILL INCREASE BENEFITS FOR MILLIONS OF SENIORS. GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM. WE PAY FOR ALL THIS AND WE GROW THE ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CAN ONLY SEE THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. HE THINKS WALL STREET BUILT THIS COUNTRY. I SEE THE WORLD FROM SCRANTON. COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES YOU LIVE IN. THE MEASURE OF ECONOMIC ACCESS IS FAMILIES TALKING ABOUT THIS AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE, BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND THEY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. HOW MANY TIMES HAS SOMEONE , I KNOW THIS TIRES ARE BALD. WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE WE CAN CONTINUE TO BORROW FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THOSE ARE THE DISCUSSIONS THAT TOOK PLACE AROUND MY TABLE. IF WERE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, WE'VE GOT TO COME TOGETHER . I MADE A SPEECH AND I THOUGHT REALLY HARD ABOUT IT IN GETTYSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA AT THE BATTLEFIELD LAST WEEK. I SAID AT THE TIME WE ARE FACING A CRISIS NOT UNLIKE WE DID OVER GETTYSBURG. I SAID I AM RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT, BUT I AM GOING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I AM GOING TO WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. AFTER ALL THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH, AFTER ALL THE YEARS WE STOOD AS A BEACON OF LIGHT TO THE WORLD WE CANNOT BE HERE AND NOW AND 2020, WE CANNOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE TO PERISH FROM THIS EARTH. FOLKS, WE HAVE IT IN OUR HANDS AND I MEAN THIS , WE HAVE THE ULTIMATE POWER. WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE POWER IN A DEMOCRACY? THE POWER TO VOTE. IN NEVADA, THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS VOTE EARLY AND RETURN YOUR BALLOT QUICKLY. BALLOTS IN CLARK COUNTY WERE MAILED TWO DAYS AGO. YOU CAN RETURN YOUR BALLOT BY MAIL. YOU CAN DROP IT OFF WITH A DROPBOX. JUST MAKE A PLAN. SERIOUSLY. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM/NV. MAKE A PLAN. MAKE SURE YOUR VOICE IS HEARD. WE CAN BE BETTER WE CAN BE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN BRING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER AGAIN WITH HIM GONE. FOLKS, LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING OR HAS NEVER EVER, EVER BEEN ANYTHING THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHEN WE HAVE DONE IT TOGETHER. NEVER, NEVER. FOLKS, LET'S STAND UP AND TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY NOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.",

         "HELLO, HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN. I'M TRYING TO GET A JOB WITH CHRIS. HE IS MR. PRESIDENT. HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE UNION. MR. PRESIDENT, I WAS KIDDING HIM. YOU KNOW, THE HARDEST THING, ONLY THING HARDER THAN BEING PRESIDENT OF A UNION IS BEING THE MAYOR OF A BEAUTIFUL CITY. FOLKS, THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE TODAY. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WE EVEN HAVE AN ASTRONAUT IN OUR HOUSE AND I TELL YOU WHAT, THAT'S PRETTY COOL. LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK CHRIS AND THE MAYOR FOR BEING HERE, AND ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOU KNOW, THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES. OVER 200,000 AMERICANS HAVE PASSED AWAY. OVER 200,000, AND THE NUMBER IS STILL RISING. THE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES IS BAD ACROSS THE BOARD, BUT PARTICULARLY BAD FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. ALMOST FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY, THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO CATCH THE DISEASE, COVID, AND WHEN IT'S CAUGHT, TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE AS WHITE AMERICANS. IT'S SORT OF EMBLEMATIC OF THE INEQUALITY THAT EXISTS AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXIST. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTERS TO ME, IS IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. YOU HAVE 30 MILLION PEOPLE ON UNEMPLOYMENT, YOU HAVE 20 MILLION PEOPLE FIGURING WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN PAY THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENT THIS MONTH, AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO OR NOT DO AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT, AND YOU'VE GOT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THROWN OUT IN THE STREET BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY THEIR RENT. ALTHOUGH THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN A REPRIEVE FOR THREE MONTHS, BUT THEY HAVE TO PAY DOUBLE THE NEXT THREE MONTHS WHEN IT COMES AROUND. HOW ARE PEOPLE GOING TO DO THAT? AND THE WAY, IN FACT, THE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE AND THE SENATE STEPPED UP AND PASSED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO HELP PEOPLE GET THROUGH THE PROCESS, INCLUDING KEEPING BUSINESSES OPEN AND THE LIKE. WELL, GUESS WHAT? THEY INSISTED THERE BEING A THING CALLED AN INSPECTOR GENERAL, SOMEBODY WATCHING WHERE EVERY DOLLAR WENT. THE FIRST THING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DID IS FIRE THAT INSPECTOR GENERAL. THERE IS NO INSPECTOR. HE'S FIRED. FIRED. AND SO YOU'VE GOT ONLY 40% OF THE MONEY INTENDED FOR SMALL BUSINESSES GOING TO SMALL BUSINESSES. ONLY 40% OF IT. 60% HAS GONE TO THE MAR-A-LAGO CROWD. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE FIND OURSELVES IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR PEOPLE IS VERY MUCH IN DOUBT, ALTHOUGH THE HOUSE JUST PASSED A PACKAGE TODAY. MY GENERIC POINT IS, THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLUMBIA POINTED OUT, THAT IF IN FACT THE PRESIDENT HAD ACTED, EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW NOW HE KNEW EXACTLY HOW BAD THE PANDEMIC WAS BACK IN FEBRUARY , HE IS ON TAPE WITH BOB WOODWARD SAYING HE KNEW HOW BAD IT WAS AND HE DIDN'T SAY A THING. HE DIDN'T SAY A THING. IF HE HAD SPOKEN, AS I SAID, THEY SAID AT COLUMBIA, ONE WEEK EARLIER, 37,000 MORE PEOPLE BE ALIVE TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER INFLUX OF CASES, JUST BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY, IT'S EXPECTED THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DEPENDING ON WHICH ESTIMATE YOU , TAKE, BETWEEN 138000 AND 178,000 MORE DEATHS. AND IF PEOPLE JUST DO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE, AND WHEN YOU'RE AT A SOCIAL DISTANCE, AS I AM, YOU CAN TAKE A MASK OFF, BUT WEAR A MASK. THEY ESTIMATE THAT WOULD SAVE ABOUT CLOSE TO 90,000 PEOPLE. 89,000, AND SO IT'S ABOUT BEING RESPONSIBLE. IT'S ABOUT BEING RESPONSIBLE. AND WE'RE NOT BEING VERY RESPONSIBLE. BUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS THAT WE HAVE TO BREAK A CYCLE. THE CYCLE THAT EXISTS IS THAT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY BY AND LARGE FINDS ITSELF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ECONOMIC HEAP, BUSINESSES AND OTHERS, WHEN THINGS ARE GOOD. WHEN THINGS GET BAD, THEY'RE THE FIRST ONES IN THE HOLE. AND WHEN THINGS GET BETTER, THEY'RE THE LAST ONES OUT. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT NEEDS SIGNIFICANT REPAIR. AND WE'RE JUST ONLY BEGINNING, SLIGHTLY, TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS NOW. AND THIRDLY, IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS PERSON, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, EVERY PERSON OUT THERE WANTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT FOR THEIR FAMILY. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, 'EVERYBODY'S ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY.' HE SAID 'JOEY, A JOB IS ABOUT A , LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. BEING ABLE TO HOLD YOUR HEAD UP. BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, 'HONEY, EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY.' FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, THEY CAN'T SAY THAT. THAT'S NOT ABLE TO BE DONE. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT TODAY, IS HOW DO WE BUILD WEALTH? ULTIMATELY, ULTIMATELY THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY ONLY IS GOING TO HAVE ITS PLACE EQUAL TO EVERYONE ELSE WHEN THEY'RE IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO BUILD WEALTH, BE ABLE TO BUILD WEALTH. AND THAT GOES FOR EVERYTHING FROM ACCESS TO BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE A HOME, ACCESS TO JOBS, ACCESS TO JUST BEING ABLE TO HAVE AN EVEN SHOT. THAT'S WHAT I HOPE WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT TODAY. IT GOES TO EDUCATION, AS WELL AS ACCESS TO EDUCATION, ACCESS BEYOND. EVERYTHING FROM A LOT OF POOR WHITES AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS, POOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS LIVE IN TITLE I DISTRICTS, MEANING THAT THEY LIVE IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE VERY LOW TAX BASE. RIGHT NOW WE SPEND $15 BILLION A YEAR TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT LOW TAX BASE. I INCREASED THAT TO $45 BILLION. BUT IT DOESN'T KEEP TEACHERS IN SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE'RE SHORT TEACHERS SIGNIFICANTLY. 125,000 TEACHERS SHORT RIGHT NOW. BE OVER HALF A MILLION BY 2023. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE FIND OURSELVES IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE USED TO HAVE IN OUR SCHOOLS, IN THE OLD DAYS, USED TO HAVE 1 , NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY, WE VIRTUALLY HAVE NO SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND SO TEACHERS COME IN TO SCHOOL AND THEY'RE EXPECTED TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. WELL, THERE'S ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST FOR EVERY 1,507 KIDS IN SCHOOL. IT SHOULD BE CLOSER TO ONE TO 500. WE CAN DO THAT BY INCREASING THE MONEY I JUST TALKED ABOUT FROM 15 TO 45. AND SEND EVERY SINGLE CHILD THAT'S THREE YEARS OLD, FOUR YEARS OLD, AND FIVE YEARS OLD, NOT TO DAYCARE, BUT TO SCHOOL. ALL THE STUDIES OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITIES IN THIS STATE AND EVERY OTHER HAVE POINTED OUT IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, THAT'LL INCREASE BY 58% THEIR CHANCES OF GOING ALL THE WAY THROUGH SCHOOL, NO MATTER WHAT THE ZIP CODE THEY COME FROM, NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE, AND BE ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT GETTING THEMSELVES IN TROUBLE. THEN WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT, I THINK A BIG ISSUE HERE IS ACCESS TO APPRENTICESHIPS AND ACCESS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND COLLEGE, AND THE STUDENT DEBT REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE THERE. HOPE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BASICALLY ONE BIG, IMPORTANT THING, HOW DO WE CHANGE THE DYNAMIC? THIS IS A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY. AS BAD AS THINGS HAVE GOTTEN, THE BLINDERS HAVE SORT OF BEEN TAKEN OFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOW. THEY LOOK OUT THERE AND WE HAVE A PANDEMIC, UNEMPLOYMENT, RACE RELATIONS HAVE JUST BEEN DRAWN INTO FOCUS EVERYTHING FROM , POLICE BRUTALITY TO LACK OF ACCESS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALL OF A SUDDEN, AVERAGE PEOPLE HAVE GONE, 'MY LORD. HOLY MACKEREL. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THIS BAD.' A LOT OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW. A LOT DID. BUT A LOT DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THIS BAD. WELL, I WON'T GO INTO IT. I'M TALKING TOO MUCH NOW IN MY OPENING STATEMENT, BUT HERE'S THE POINT. THE POINT IS, I BELIEVE WE HAVE A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY, A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE SYSTEMIC RACISM AND THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS THAT EXIST IN OUR SYSTEM. I THINK WE HAVE TO DO IT, BUT ONLY ONE WAY TO DO IT. WE'VE GOT TO SHOW UP AND VOTE. BUT I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE TURNED OFF. I BELIEVE NO MATTER WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES TO TRY TO MAKE IT HARD TO VOTE FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST PEOPLE OF COLOR, BUT EVERYONE, NO MATTER WHAT, I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN VIRGINIA, EARLY VOTING. THEY HAVE FOUR-HOUR LINES IN THE FIRST DAY, AND WE'RE OVER 40 DAYS OUT. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SHOW UP AND VOTE. THEY WILL NOT BE DISSUADED. SO THAT'S WHY I'M OPTIMISTIC. I WAS ASKED BY ONE OF THE FOREIGN LEADERS WHEN I WAS OVERSEAS, WHEN I WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT, THEY SAID, 'CAN YOU DEFINE AMERICA FOR ME?' I SAID, 'YES, I CAN, IN ONE WORD. POSSIBILITIES. POSSIBILITIES.' WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT BELIEVES ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. I THINK WE GOT A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY IN THE YEAR 2020 TO MAKE THESE CHANGES. WITH THAT, AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, I'M GOING TO HUSH UP AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU ALL HAVE. I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY HERE.",

THIS ELECTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYONE YOU HAVE EVER BEEN ENGAGED IN. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO HAS PROMOTED HATE AND DIVISION AND ENCOURAGED WHITE SUPREMACY AND EMBRACES DICTATORSHIPS AROUND THE WORLD,. LOOK, OUR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING, THEY ARE WATCHING. IT MATTERS WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAY AND DO. BARACK OBAMA THEY WATCHED AND THE EMULATED, THEY WANTED TO BE LIKE HIM. FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP ULTIMATELY CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP IS THE OVERWHELMING IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE TO FOLKS, WE CAN BEGIN TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS NATION. HARD-WORKING PEOPLE, MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD AMERICA. YOU BUILT. AMERICA. ERRORS PEOPLE GIVEN A CHANCE IN AMERICA , AVERAGE PEOPLE GIVEN A CHANCE IN AMERICA. NOW THE BOTTOM IS FALLING OUT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. INCOME INEQUITY IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. TRUMP TAX CUTS AND ENORMOUS GIVEAWAYS TO THE TOP 1/10 OF 1%. IT'S TIME WE START TO REWARD WORK OVER WEALTH. WE NEED TO BIG , BOLD. THE TAX LOOPHOLES BUILT IN THAT HAVE NO SOCIAL REDEEMING VALUE. AND PUT THAT MONEY TO GOOD USE. HEALTH CARE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE NEED TO SAVE AND BUILD UPON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, NOT SAID IT, JETTISON IT. 20 MILLION PEOPLE ARE COVERED THAT WERE NOT BEFORE. 140 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. I AM , I WAS PROUD EVERY DAY TO SERVE WITH BARACK OBAMA BUT LET ME TELL YOU, NEVER PROUDER THAN HE GOT DONE WHAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO DO. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO CREATE THE JOBS. UNDER MY PLAN, WHETHER YOU'RE COVERED BY EMPLOYER ON YOUR OWN OR NOT AT ALL YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FLY INTO A PUBLIC HEALTH CARE OPTION LIKE MEDICARE. AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE IT AND IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE ENROLLED IN THAT. WE CAN GUARANTEE THAT THE POOR , ARE IN FACT COVERED BECAUSE THEY CAN BE, AND IT IS WITHIN OUR INTEREST IN IT WILL SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, EDUCATION. 12 YEARS ARE NO LONGER ENOUGH FOR THE 12 FOR CENTURY OF EDUCATION. FOLKS, THAT IS WHY WANTED TRIPLE TITLE I FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. AND, BY THE WAY, WE CAN AFFORD TO DO THIS. $15 TO $45 BILLION, WE NEED UNIVERSAL PRE-K WE NEED TO RAISE TEACHERS PAY AND WE NEED TO FULLY FUND SPECIAL EDUCATION' NUMBER OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST, GUIDANCE COUNSELORS AND NURSES BECAUSE TEACHERS CANNOT DO IT ALL ON THEIR OWN. AND, OLKFOLKS, WE CAN EASILY AFFORD FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CUTTING IN HALF THE COST OF FOUR YEAR COLLEGES FOR EVERYONE QUALIFIED TO GET IN AND, WE HAVE TO REDUCE THE STUDENT DEBT WHICH I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO GO INTO NOW BUT WE WILL. CHAPTER. I, CHILDCARE. I KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE A SINGLE PARENT. I WAS ONE FOR FIVE YEARS. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE FOR PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE HELP THAT I HAD. I THINK WE SHOULD PROVIDE AN $8,000 TAX CREDIT FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAS A CHILD THAT NEEDS CHILDCARE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, CLIMATE CHANGE. WE HAVE TO RESTORE WHAT BARACK OBAMA AND I DID IN TERMS OF FUEL ECONOMY AND DOUBLING THE FUEL ECONOMY AS WELL AS COAL FIRED PLANTS. WE CAN DOUBLE OUR SHORES , WIND ENERGY BY 2030 PROVIDING $400 BILLION IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS FOR CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION. MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH AS WE SPENT GOING TO THE MOON. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ALSO HAVE TO HOLD A LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE. YOU SAW THE HEADLINES TODAY'S PAPER. IT SAID, SOUTH CAROLINA $2 BILLION PIPES LIKE TISSUE PAPER THREATENING PUBLIC HEALTH. IT IS ON EXCEPT , UNACCEPTABLE THAT THAT OCCURRED. IT IS NOT JUST IN SOUTH CAROLINA. IT IS AROUND AMERICA. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THERE IT TOO MEET PEOPLE IN PRISON AND TOO MANY BLACK MEN AND BLACK WOMEN IN PRISON. IN OUR ADMINISTRATION WE STARTED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND REFORM PRISONS BY 38,000 PEOPLE CAME OUT. WE PASSED THE SUPPORT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND INITIATIVES TO BREAK THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE BUT WE NEED TO PASS BOBBY SCOTT FROM VIRGINIA'S SAFE JUSTICE ACT. I GOT TO ADD A FEW THINGS. NO MORE MANDATORY MINIMUMS. PERIOD. AND PRIVATE PRISONS WHICH WE DID IN OUR BILL. PERIOD. FUND MY DRUG COURTS, TO ABOUT $1 BILLION THE YEAR. NO ONE SHOULD BE GOING TO JAIL BECAUSE THEY ARE ADDICTED. THEY SHOULD BE GOING INTO REHABILITATION, NOT TO JAIL. BAIL REFORM. IS BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY SHOULD NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD LANGUISH IN JAIL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NO TUNABLES , NO JUVENILE AS AN ADULT PRISON AND MANDATORY TREATMENT IN JAIL FOR PEOPLE WHO ALSO SUFFER FROM ADDICTION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA AND AUTOMATICALLY EXPUNGE RECORDS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED. AND, BY THE WAY, INSTEAD OF KICKING PEOPLE , WE SHOULD BE EDUCATING PEOPLE IN PRISON. IT IS IN OUR INTEREST TO DO SO. AUTOMATIC RESTORATION OF RIGHTS, MEANING NOT ONLY YOU CAN VOTE BUT YOU QUALIFY FOR EVERY PROGRAM INCLUDING PELL GRANTS TO GET YOUR EDUCATION. IT MAKES NO SENSE. LOOK, FOLKS, WE HAVE TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HARNESS THIS. WE ARE IN A COUPLE OF MAJOR CHANGES AND CANCER, DIABETES AND ALZHEIMER'S. WE CAN DO THIS BY DOUBLING NIH'S BUDGET AND SET UP A NEW PROJECT THAT , LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TO COME UP WITH THE WHOLE INTERNET, PROVIDE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR BASIC RESEARCH. HEALTHCARE, FOCUS ON RESEARCH AND TAKE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON SOLVING PROBLEMS THAT IS WITHIN OUR REACH LIKE THAT CANCER INITIATIVE AND THE MOONSHOT. LOOK, I GBBEAT THE NRA BEFORE. WE OUGHT TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS AND MAGAZINES, AND, BY THE WAY, NEW TECHNOLOGY, YOU CANNOT ACQUIRE A GUN UNLESS YO UHAVE BIOMETRIC PRINT ON IT. NO PROBLEM IN TERMS OF SECOND AMENDMENT AND YOU HAVE TO PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK WHICH I PUT INTO LAW AS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BRADY AMENDMENT. EVERYBODY, FOLKS, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CAN FUNDAMENTALLY RESHAPE OUR LIVES. I'M NEVER MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO PICK OUR HEADS UP. I REMEMBER THE PHRASE FROM JOHN KENNEDY GOING TO THE MOON, BECAUSE WE ARE UNWILLING TO POSTPONE. I'M NOT WILLING TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER THE POTENTIAL OF THIS NATION.

I especially want to thank our amazing leadership team: Republican Whip, and one of the bravest men I know, Steve Scalise. Steve, thank you very much. (Applause.) Conference Chair Liz Cheney. (Applause.) Thank you, Liz. NRCC Chair Tom Emmer. Tom. (Applause.) Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Tom. And Chief Deputy Whip Drew Ferguson. Great job. (Applause.) Thank you, Drew. Great job. I also want to proudly welcome our newest Republican congressmen , two people that fought a big fight for the last number of months, and they're winners. They reacted so incredibly under pressure. The whole world was watching. A lot of people were hoping for the opposite outcome, but many more people were hoping for the outcome that we had. A man who wasn't expected necessarily to win, and then he got in gear and he was brutal and brilliant, and he did a great job. Now, soon to be, and now Congressman Dan Bishop , for many years. Thank you, Dan. (Applause.) Dan, thank you. What a great job. (Applause.) What a great job, Dan. And another man who fought so hard and he was supposed to win by a little tiny bit, a couple of points, and he won by a lot of points. That was a big victory, and I want to just congratulate you. Greg Murphy is going to be with you folks for a long time. (Applause.) These two people are special people. North Carolina , thank you, North Carolina. (Applause.) They were some crowds that turned out. They turned out, and they turned out like people never expected. And they were , that was just a great evening of television. I wouldn't say the fake news was too happy with the outcome, but that's okay. That's okay. We did it. And we worked together as a team, and it was very inspirational for a lot of people to watch. Everyone here tonight has a critical role to play at the vital crossroads of our nation. Democrats in Congress have embraced an extreme, destructive, and dangerous agenda: radical socialism and open borders. Democrats are determined to replicate the most catastrophic failures of world history right here in the United States. They've never learned. They haven't watched. Each of you in the House Republican Conference is on the frontlines defending American freedom, American security, American prosperity, and the American way of life. You're the ones , you're doing the defense. Hundreds of millions of our fellow citizens are counting on us, and, so help us God, we will never, ever let them down. (Applause.) Together, we're going to fight historic battles, and we have historic battles ahead of us. Going to make our country even greater. And we're going to win overwhelming victories for the American people. The spirit that we have in the Republican Party, I don't believe, has ever been this high. Over the past two and a half years, we've already delivered unprecedented progress for citizens of every background and every walk of life. Now we must go directly to the American people to share the story of what we have achieved and to explain our bold vision for the future. Working with Republicans in Congress, we slashed 30,000 pages of regulations from the Federal Register. (Applause.) And that is an all-time record, and we did that in a lot less years. That's an all-time record, no matter how long a President was there. We saved an average American household $3,000. Earlier today, my administration formally repealed the horrible, dangerous, anti-everything Waters of the United States rule. (Applause.) Thank you, Louie. Thank you, Louie. I would say the only thing that had going for it that was good was the title. (Laughter.) That was , I said, 'I'm the only one that would sign this.' But it was a good thing we did. Right, Louie? It was a good thing we did. Government will no longer try to micromanage every rain puddle and every drainage ditch on private land. They took your land away from you. Together, we enacted the VA Accountability Act, so that anyone who mistreats or abuses our great veterans can be promptly fired. (Applause.) There was a time you couldn't fire anyone, no matter how they treated our veterans, whether they stole or they were sadists. And we had some of them too. You couldn't fire them, and now we can do it very, very quickly and easily. They don't treat our veterans well. We get them out. Since then, we've removed more than 7,600 employees who failed to give our vets the care they so richly deserve. We're also very proud to tell you that the Veterans Choice, which is something special , so special; they've been trying to get it for decades and decades , Choice , so that more veterans have the right to see a private doctor, if they have to wait on line, instead of waiting for two weeks or three weeks or five weeks, or numbers that you wouldn't even believe. Think of it. You're sick, you're not feeling well, and they tell you, 'Come back in four weeks.' Now you go outside, you go to a local doctor of your choice, by the way , unlike somebody else, where they said, 'You can have your doctor and you can have your plan' 28 times. That didn't work out too well. (Laughter.) You go out and you see a doctor of your choice. We pay the bill. And it's been an incredible thing. I'll tell you, what's happening at the VA has been really something special. If you look and , you just see it. All you used to see and read about is how bad the VA was run, how horrible it was. And you don't hear those stories anymore. Now, you know, what we'll go is these people will run out and they'll start trying to find somebody. 'Who is unhappy?' Thousands and hundreds of thousands of people? 'Who's unhappy? Please call us immediately.' And that's the problem. But I will tell you, people are really happy. What we've done there is incredible. We achieved record funding to restore the awesome might of the American military: $700 billion last year; $716 billion this year; and now, just approved , thank you very much , $738 billion next year. (Applause.) More money, by far, than ever before. And remember, that's all money; it's built in the USA. We build it right here. America, I will tell you, is respected again. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. We have the greatest equipment. We have people with spirit like they haven't had. But we now have the greatest equipment. When I came in two and a half years ago, our equipment was old and tired. Our ammunition was low. Our planes didn't fly well. Many of them didn't fly at all. Now we have beautiful, new planes and jets and fighter jets and bombers. And we have everything. And hopefully we don't have to use them too much, and maybe we don't have to use them at all. But we have the greatest military we've ever had. (Applause.) And, together, so importantly, we ended the last administration's heartless war on American energy. For all of the folks in Texas , we got a lot of you tonight , you're very happy. And plenty of other places. But you're very happy. (Applause.) The United States is now the number one energy producer anywhere in the world, by far. (Applause.) For the first time in more than 60 years , this just happened , we are now a net exporter of American natural gas. (Applause.) And we're ending decades of foreign energy reliance to unleash the blessings of American energy independence. We are really , if you look at what's going on in certain countries in the Middle East, and you look at the Straits, and you see the ships, and they're being taken and they're being , not too often, by the way, because, frankly, Iran is a much different country than it was two and a half years ago. But they were saying, 'We don't see any American ships.' There are no Amer- , number one, they wouldn't take them. They better not take them. And number two, we don't have too many there. We used to be flooded. We used to get everything there. And now it's a whole different story. We're very energy-independent. We've invested billions of dollars to combat the opioid crisis and those struggling with addiction to find access to treatment, education, and employment. A tremendous problem. We've had tremendous success with opioid. Not that it goes away, but we're looking very strongly for something that can really take away the pain , just take away the pain without being addictive. And we're getting very close. This is a brutal , people go into the hospital for a week, and they come out drug addicts. They come out addicted. It's a terrible thing. But we're working very hard, and we're getting very close, finding a pain killer that's not addictive. For the first time in three decades, drug overdose deaths have declined. Think of that. Over 30 years. (Applause.) First time. Thanks to the entire Republican team in Congress, we passed the biggest tax cut and reform in American history. (Applause.) And we're now working on a middle tax. We're working on a tax cut for the middle-income people. That is going to be very, very inspirational. It's going to be something that I think it's what everyone is really looking for. And we'll be announcing it sometime in the next year. But it'll be a very, very substantial tax cut for middle-income folks who work so hard. And we look forward to that. We're going to work on it all together. And you see what the other tax cut has done. And, frankly, I'm not sure, but I would say that the regulation cuts , those massive cuts in regulation , still have plenty of regulation , but those massive cuts probably equal the tax cuts in terms of jobs and in terms of businesses. The combination of everything really worked because we probably have, right now, the strongest economy in the history of our nation. (Applause.) And where the media is trying to , begging. Oh, they want a recession so badly. Oh. (Laughter.) The word. And every time they go after us, you notice the market goes up? It's the craziest thing. You're going to have to explain this one to me. But we're doing great. We're very close to having another stock market record. It went up again today. And we had , I think it's over 100 records. In other words, days where the stock market hit, in the history of our country , all-time highs. I think it's over 100. I'll get the exact number, but it is really something. And we are very close. And about three weeks ago, if you listened, it was like 'doom and gloom.' I don't think they believed it, but that's okay. I will tell you, we're doing very well with China, because China would like to do something. We're taking in billions and billions of tariffs. And they're eating the cost. This is not being borne very much by us. They're eating the costs. But we're taking in billions and billions. Money flowing in. We've never taken in 10 cents from China. And they want to do something because their supply lines, their supply chains, are being broken like toys. And people are leaving, and people are , millions of jobs in China are being lost. And we don't want that, but we want a fair deal. We lowered our business tax from one of the highest in the world to one of the most competitive. Since that law was passed, nearly $1 trillion have returned to our shores. One trillion dollars. It was part of what we did. We doubled the child tax credit. (Applause.) Thank you to a number of people for that, but especially Ivanka Trump. That was so important to her to make sure that she understood. (Applause.) Jared is here, but she understood exactly what that meant. She worked so hard on that. We created Opportunity Zones to revitalize distressed communities. Tim Scott was fantastic, and so many other senators. They worked with us so hard on that. But Tim Scott in particular really worked hard. South Carolina. And we thanked him. But they are , they are doing numbers that nobody believed possible, the Opportunity Zones. So much money is going to into areas where it would never seen , see money, and it hasn't seen it in a long time. We eliminated Obamacare's cruel and unpopular individual mandate. (Applause.) Since our election in 2016, we've created more than 6 million new jobs, including over 1 million manufacturing, energy, and construction jobs. Remember when President Obama said, 'No, no, forget the manufacturing; not going to happen'? Well, we have almost 600,000, just in terms of manufacturing jobs. And nobody thought that was possible. And, frankly, as soon as we get the trade stuff, perfect , just the way we want it; we'll only sign it when it's good, really good. Wait until you see what happens with this economy. We are ready to really rock it even more. We've done very well. You go from Election Night, the day after , take November 9th , and you look at the numbers on stock markets, over 50 percent; 401k(s) are through the roof. People come up to me all the time: 'Thank you, sir. My 401(k) is up 72 percent.' It's up , whatever it may be. Numbers that they've never had before. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. And this is when we're fighting people on trade, when we have this great military, and we defend countries that are immensely wealthy and they don't help us out, they don't pay us for almost anything. And we're talking to those countries. They're our friends, they're our allies. Sometimes our allies treat us worse than anybody else. But we can't let that happen, and they don't want to let that happen. It just takes a little getting used to, because nobody has ever asked them. 'Look, we're defending your country, you're rich as can be. You got to help us out. You got to pay a little bit.' And they go, 'No, no.' I say, 'No, no, no, King. You got to pay.' 'No, no, Mr. President.' 'Mr. Prime Minister, you go to pay. You got to pay.' And the answer is, 'But, uh, nobody has ever asked us to do that before.' I said, 'That's why I'm different. That's why I'm different. I'm asking you to do it.' (Applause.) I always say, 'You know, tell me, why are we defending you for free?' Or 'Why are we defending you for a tiny fraction of what it costs? And then you take advantage of the United States for many years, on trade?' So we get killed with trade, we get killed with defending your nation. 'Tell me, Mr. President, tell me, Mr. Prime Minister, tell me, King or Queen, why are we protecting your country and you take advantage, really, of us on trade?' And they go, 'But nobody has ever asked me that question before.' I said, 'Tell me why.' They can't think of an answer. The only thing they say all the time , because it has always been that way , I said, 'Well, it's not going to be that way any longer. You got to pay.' (Applause.) It's true. Not going to be that way any longer. Last month alone, nearly 600,000 people joined our workforce. For the first time ever, most new hires are minorities and women. Nobody knows that because the media doesn't get that across. (Applause.) More than 7 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. And we now have a , 13 straight months of wage gains of at least 3 percent. (Applause.) Think of that. Remember, during the campaign, I used to say that people would go back 21 years , that was when I was running , 21 years. And they made more money 21 years ago than they were making two and a half years ago. They were making more money. And I said, 'Isn't that terrible?' And they had two jobs and even three jobs, and they made more money 21 years before. Not anymore. African American and Hispanic American unemployment have reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country. (Applause.) I wonder if that will be mentioned tonight during the debate. (Laughter.) I don't know, I have a feeling. What do you think, Steve? I don't think so. Kevin, you think they'll be talking about that? I don't think so. That's a good debate point. As they hit me left and right, I'll say, African American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been. And just leave the stage, and say, 'Thank you very much. Good luck.' (Laughter and applause.) But another good one is that African American and Hispanic American poverty rates have also reached the all-time, in our history, record lows. I mean, how do you lose this debate? (Applause.) How do you lose the debate? That's a tough one to beat also. Our Pledge to the American Worker has already secured commitments for 13 million employment and training opportunities for American citizens. We have these great companies , greatest companies in the world , and they're training people. Government can't really train them. We're training people through these incredible programs where we're going to these unbelievable , Walmart, as an example, and so many others. We're going to the companies, and they're taking people and training them. We could never train them for that. Nobody can train them for that; only the company itself. Thirteen million people, and it's something beautiful to see. We gather tonight to celebrate these extraordinary gains. We've done things that I don't think any administration has even come close in the first two and a half years. We have done things that very, very few have even thought about doing. But we also meet to prepare for the coming fight, because the traditions and beliefs that have made the American Dream possible are under attack like never before. You've never seen anything like it; I've never seen anything like it. House Democrats are pursuing the most radical far-left program ever put forward in that historic chamber. It's the Democrats and it's the media. We're fighting two battles. The Democrats and the media, it's as if they're one. Because they are one. They're working together. They're colluding. (Laughter.) And they're obstructing. (Applause.) With the grim specter of socialism descending on the Democrat Party, it's up to all of us to ensure the survival of American liberty. We have a big task. We have a very big task. Don't forget, the people say, 'Oh, you're going to beat this one or that one,' and 'they're so far left.' It's very hard to beat a socialist when you have a very wealthy country. We have a very wealthy country. And when they say, 'We're going to give away your healthcare. We're going to do free education. We're going to cut student loan debt down to nothing , $1.6 trillion out the window. We're going to do this, we're going to do that.' Everything is given away. And then they say, 'Oh, we don't have to raise your taxes too much.' If you paid five times what people are paying right now, you wouldn't come close. And, you know, we're working very hard on a place called Venezuela. Fifteen years ago, it was one of the wealthiest countries in the world. And, today, they don't have food. They don't have water. They don't have anything. They don't have anything. We're sending things to help them , we have to , on a humanitarian basis. And we're working with Colombia and other nations to help the people that have been able to essentially escape. But that was socialism. And look what happened to them in a short period of time. On issue after issue, Americans must choose between two fundamentally different visions that will define our nation for many generations to come. More than 130 Democrats in Congress have signed up for the Bernie Sanders total government takeover of healthcare , (laughter) , Crazy Bernie; he is a crazy guy , which would dramatically raise middle-class taxes, eliminate private health insurance for 180 million Americans, and destroy Medicare forever. Republicans will always protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and they paid for it. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. (Applause.) Two hundred and twenty-eight House Democrats voted to put America back into the disastrous Paris Climate Accord. How's that working out for Paris? How's that one working out for France? The yellow vests. They didn't like all that money being sent to people that they never heard of, the country from which they came. And it hasn't been working out well. But that would have been a disaster for us. It would have cost us a tremendous fortune. They were going to take away our wealth. They were going to say we can't do certain businesses. We can't take the oil and gas. We can't do anything. This would have been one of the great travesties. And you know, incredibly, that and the Clean Waters Act, which didn't give you clean waters. By the way, today, we have the cleanest air, we have the cleanest water that we've ever had in the history of our country. Right, Louie? (Applause.) And just for the press , because they'll get me on that one, I'm thinking , let's say, the history of our country over the last 25 years. You know, I would say that the first few years, they probably had cleaner air and cleaner water because there was nobody here. (Laughter.) So I have to be very accurate. But they'll put it on anyway. They won't put , right, Louie? They won't put the second part on. They won't put the explanation on. But we do. We have clean air; we have clean water. The Paris Accord would do nothing to improve our environment. It would only punish our country while foreign polluters operate with impunity. Isn't it incredible? You look at China, you look at India, you look at Russia, you look at so many other places, their smokestacks are pouring out. Everything is pouring out. And I want to be clean. And we're going to be clean. But isn't it, sort of, na�ve? And then they talk about plastic straws. I say, 'What about the plate? What about the wrapper that's made out of a much tougher plastic? What about all the other plastic?' 'Well, we haven't gotten to that. Just straws. That's the only thing we're worried about.' Someday, you'll explain that to me, Louie. I'm sure you , you're a big environmentalist. Can you explain the straw? No, I don't think so. Nobody else can either. By the way, you know who else can't? They can't. (Laughter.) They can't explain it. We did a couple of things. We're working on cars because for a virtually just insignificant amount of energy, we're going to be able to produce cars that are substantially , by $3,500 or so , cheaper, less expensive, that are much, much safer , (applause) , because they're heavier, they're stronger. They're not made out of papier-m�ch�. (Laughter.) They're heavier, stronger, and they'll cost a lot less money. And you saw that. The lightbulb. People said, 'What's with the lightbulb?' I said, 'Here's the story ' And I looked at it , the bulb that we're being forced to use , number one, to me, most importantly, the light is no good. I always look orange. (Laughter and applause.) And so do you. The light is the worst. But number two, it's many times more expensive than that old incandescent bulb that worked very well. And very importantly , I don't know if you know this , they have warnings. If it breaks, it's considered a hazardous waste site. It's gasses inside. And read what they say: 'If it breaks, bring it to your local whatever. Have it wrapped, have it this.' What are we doing? What are we doing? And I said to one of the top people today, 'Well, they break a lot. Don't they?' 'Yes, sir.' 'What do they do?' 'They just throw them away. They don't care.' But they call it 'hazardous waste.' But it's many times more expensive. And the light is not as good. I mean, frankly, the light is not as good. So, we're going to solve that. But we're also going to solve incandescent bulbs. And people are so happy about it. It's really been pretty amazing. (Applause.) People don't tell you why. All they do is say, 'Oh, he's getting rid of an energy-efficient bulb.' Well, they don't tell you about the dangers of the bulb, and they don't tell you about the cost of that bulb. Over 100 Democrats have signed up to support the 100- trillion-dollar Green New Deal. (Laughter.) That's a beauty. No more cows. No more planes. I guess, no more people, right? (Laughter.) Because Kevin is just like a cow; he's just smaller. (Laughter.) I had to pick somebody for that one, Kevin, and I just looked at that beautiful, political face of yours, you know? (Laughter.) There's a little truth to that. But this Green New Deal is crazy. Now, they're talking about it tonight. I see hardened Democrat politicians that are , you know, have been smart. And I say, 'It's incredible. They're standing behind AOC' , I call her 'Cortez,' because you don't have enough time to go through the whole name. I just call , (laughter) , 'Cortez.' They don't like that, when you call her Cortez, but her name is Cortez. Too , too long. Or I call her 'AOC.' Then I call the others 'AOC plus 3.' (Laughter.) They don't like that. AOC plus 3. That's the definition. But you know, I see her, and I see what's she's talking. She's , she's going through this deal. It's so insane. But I don't want to talk about it. It's too early. I hit Pocahontas way too early. (Laughter.) I thought she was gone. She's emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she could beat Sleepy Joe. He's fallen asleep. He has no idea what the hell he's doing or saying. (Laughter.) And President Xi of China, he is tough. Oh, boy, he's a furious kind of a guy. Great guy, but fur- , he's dying to see , he wants Sleepy Joe. Can you imagine those two guys in a room? Here's Xi: 'Hwah!' And here's Sleepy Joe, 'What?' (Laughter.) 'Where am I? Where am I?' 'Just sign here, Sleepy Joe. Just sign here.' (Laughter.) 'Like you guys have been doing for the last 25 years. Let us keep taking $500 billion out of your account. Let's keep rebuilding China with America's money.' That's stopping. A lot of things are stopping that are bad and foolish, crazy. But we won't let Democrats obliterate domestic industry and cripple working-class families with sky-high energy prices. Democrats are proposing to pack the courts with lawless activist judges. We have one. We have many. Look at some of these rulings. But lately, we're doing well. Lately, we're doing well. (Applause.) And today, I signed the 150th judge. (Applause.) Federal judge. Think of it: One hundred and fifty, including court of appeals and two great Supreme Court justices. Think of that. (Applause.) And yesterday, coincidentally, we just won the asylum case. The big one. (Applause.) The big one. And we won it in a vote of 7 to 2. So, that wasn't a very close one, Kevin. Seven to two. And to me , so importantly , because we want to build that wall, we're going to build that wall, and we are building that wall. Because three months ago, we won the case on the wall, so that wall is being built and it's being built rapidly. (Applause.) And we hope to have as much as 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year. Five hundred miles. That's a lot. That's about what we want. (Applause.) And that's being built despite the most obstructive group of people I've ever seen. And, let me tell you, if they want to run their campaign on open borders, and if they want to run their campaign on some of the things they're saying , Green New Deal and all it entails , I just say, let them go. Don't criticize it too much, please. Because one thing I've learned about politics: You can say something one day that's just absolutely insane like they're saying, and then, about two weeks later, say the exact opposite. And nobody will ever even call you on it. It's the craziest business. You're in the craziest business I've ever seen. (Laughter.) It's crazy. You can do whatever you want, and then, two weeks later, they'll say something different. So I want to bring them way down the pike before we start criticizing the Green New Deal. So I just want to say, because we've got a lot of television watching tonight, even though, I guess, they should be watching the debate, but they're probably watching us. (Laughter and applause.) But we have a lot. See those cameras back there. We kept the reporters out. But we have those cameras. See those red bulbs? That means we're on live. But I will tell you this: The Green New Deal , we just want that thing to go as long as it can. Because anybody that can win office, promoting the Green New Deal, they deserve to win. (Laughter.) They got to be really good. They got to have the greatest line of crap anybody has ever had in the history of politics. (Laughter and applause.) Their delivery has to be perfect. Sometimes, unfortunately, delivery is more important than what you say. And theirs has to be. And I've always said about the Democrats, they're lousy politicians, but they have one thing that's incredible: They stick together. And you people have to stick together. And you do. I know you. We have more spirit with our congressmen and women than we've ever had , that, I see. And you're in a small , you're just a little short of taking the majority. And you're going to take it. You're going to take the majority. (Applause.) And Dan , Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy, they'll tell you because they saw what happened. We went into those communities and they went out to vote like nobody has ever seen before. And I'm going to stop at every community that I can. We're going to make a list of 50 or so, and we'll stop there. I got a lot of energy. That's good. If you don't have the energy, you can forget that one. (Applause.) Hillary , she'd make two stops and she'd say, 'I got to rest for a couple of weeks.' (Laughter.) 'Let me rest for a couple of weeks.' No, she didn't like stairs. She didn't like airplanes. She didn't like a lot. She said, 'I don't have to go to Wisconsin to campaign.' Her husband Bill, who is a pro, said, 'You know, I saw what they're doing in Wisconsin. I don't like it. There's a lot of those 'Trump' and 'Trump/Pence' signs out there. There's a lot of them. I don't like it.' 'Don't worry about it, darling. Wisconsin is going to be just fine.' 'The winner of Wisconsin is Donald Trump.' (Laughter.) 'There's a lot of signs,' he said. (Applause.) 'In Michigan, there's a lot of signs on the lawns. I was there. There's signs all over the place. You got to go back to Michigan more often.' 'No, no, no. You don't understand. Michigan hasn't been won for decades by a Republican. My people tell me we're great.' I don't know who her people were. Now, that's called , if they ever threatened me with that , that I colluded with her people , that I could understand. (Laughter.) That I could , because they told her, 'Don't go back to Michigan, darling. You're okay. Don't go back.' (Laughter.) 'Donald Trump has won the great state of Michigan.' (Laughter.) 'Donald Trump has won the great state of Pennsylvania, great state of North Carolina, the great state of Florida, the great state of South Carolina.' (Applause.) Remember they said we were going to lose Texas? They didn't say that. You know, look, they're crooked as hell. (Laughter.) But they did say , remember? They said, 'Texas is in play.' (Laughter.) So being somewhat new to the game , like having done it for about three months , I said, 'Let me ask you a question. What does it mean when they say it's in play?' 'Sir, that means it's too close to call.' Well, I'm like six or seven months out. They're saying Texas is in play. So I said, 'I don't think so.' I went to make a speech. We had a line that was miles long. I don't think so. And everybody else was telling me , a great guy got on in Texas, and he's wearing this big cowboy hat, this beautiful hat. I wish we could wear them. Nobody would ever look at my hair and criticize me. (Laughter.) I'd wear that hat and I'd never take it off. Do you ever notice, in Texas, they sit down and have breakfast here , they're wearing the hat. I like that. I would do that. (Laughter.) I don't have to worry about hairspray. I don't have to worry about my hair blowing , (laughter) , beautifully blowing in the wind. (Laughter.) And this guy is on television. A big, strong Texas guy. And they asked him about the race being so close. This is like five months before the election. He said, 'I don't know where you come from, but I come from Texas. And I'll tell you a couple of things, but one of the things I'll tell you for real: This race ain't close at all.' (Laughter.) 'Trump is going to win by a lot.' So we get to the evening, and they're saying, 'Texas is in play. It's too close. It's ' The polls close at eight o'clock. Now, unless you have a huge, commanding lead, you know, it's takes an hour, two hours, three hours before they predict, right? Before they say who won. And the polls closed. 'The polls have closed in Texas. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.' (Laughter and applause.) And for like six months , and then, today, I heard it again. I think , I think it was Buttigieg. (Laughter.) Buttigieg. They said, 'Think of it as 'boot' and then 'edge-edge.' Because nobody can pronounce this guy's name. (Laughter.) Nobody. Butt-i-gieg. They say, 'Buttigieg' , (laughter) , 'and Trump.' (Laughter.) On what I've done for energy, if anybody beat me in Texas , I don't think anybody can beat me. I don't think Rockefeller can beat me in Texas , the real Rockefeller, the first Rockefeller. I think he'd have a hard time beating me in Texas. But anyway, they said, 'Buttigieg ' (Laughter.) Can you believe this guy? He's doing a rotten job running his own city. Lousy job. But they say, 'Buttigieg is two points up in the state of Texas against President Trump.' I said, 'I don't think so. I don't think so.' No, I don't worry about that too much. What do you think, Louie? Who's winning Texas? Think Buttigieg is winning Texas? (Laughter.) I've had him up to here. (Laughter and applause.) Democrats care more about illegal aliens than their own constituents. Republicans know our duty is to represent American citizens. Democrats voted against Kate's Law. How about , what's Kate's Law , how about this? And now, they even threw out the charge about gun possession, which was like the smallest , he got away with murder. He got away , can you imagine? But it's not over yet. It's not over yet. What a horrible thing took place in San Francisco with that incredible, beautiful young woman, holding her father's hand and saying, 'Daddy. Daddy, what happened?' Can you imagine the shock of it? That's just incredible. And this low-life gets out. Gets out. And people all over the world see that, and they say, 'What the hell is wrong with the United States of America?' , when they see that. Last year, more than 80 percent of House Democrats refused to support our heroes , ICE. And nearly every House Democrat voted in favor of sanctuary cities, allowing illegal aliens with severe criminal records to terrorize innocent communities. And these two guys were tremendously successful in North Carolina because all we kept doing is saying the governor and all of these Democrats , right, Dan? , all of the Democrats want sanctuary cities. And they let somebody out fairly recently, and that somebody wreaked havoc. Wreaked havoc. I won't even tell you, it was so horrible. But wreaked havoc in a community. Instead of taking him and giving him to ICE , we would have done what you had to do. But I'll tell you, the folks of ICE , at ICE , and Border Patrol and law enforcement, they're not treated properly. And we respect them. Most Americans really respect them. (Applause.) Yeah. (Applause.) You know, we have MS-13 coming in. These are the toughest people you've ever seen, but they're not as tough as ICE. And ICE runs into their nests. You know, they call them a 'nest.' This is , these are people that don't even like guns because they're not painful enough. They take young women and they slice them up with a knife. They slice them up , beautiful, young , in a case, two 16-year-old young girls walking home from school. They took them and they sliced them up because it was more painful. They killed them. Animals. And then, if you use the term 'animal' , I mean, look, you know, Nancy Pelosi attacked me because I called them 'animals.' Remember that? She said, 'They're not animals. They're human beings.' Well, I don't think so. But ICE will go into a nest. They call it a 'nest' , where you have a lot of them congregating, up to no good. And ICE will run into that nest like it's , like they're having breakfast with their family on Monday morning. They're tough. And they're patriots, and they love our country. And we're throwing out MS-13 by the thousands. We're throwing them , we're getting them the hell out of our country. (Applause.) And even tough sheriffs say, 'You know, sir, better that they do it.' And I agree with them. Better that they do it. And the sheriffs agree. But they say, 'Better that they do it.' And then you have the Democrats. They want to keep them around. And they want to actually take care of them and protect them. And, I don't know, if you tell me that's good politics. And I don't even care about the politics. But it's so bad for our country. But if you tell me you can win with that , with open borders, with no ICE. If you don't have ICE, this country would be overridden. We take out thousands of people , bad people. Really bad people. Public servants make a sacred pledge to defend the nation and its people. Politicians who support sanctuary cities have forsaken this solemn vow. Instead of making a shameful pact to shield and harbor criminal fugitives at any cost , they will do it at any cost. But I'll tell you, people in California , and I see it more and more , they don't want sanctuary cities; it's the politicians that want them. A lot of the people are revolting in different communities. They don't want sanctuary cities. They want to be safe. They can't be safe with sanctuary cities. They're protecting, in many cases, criminals. In July, Montgomery County, Maryland, declared itself a sanctuary city for criminal aliens, forcing local jails to release these dangerous inmates, instead of safely handing them over to ICE. Just hand them over to ICE. Just hand them over to ICE. ICE will take care of the rest. Less than two months later, eight illegal aliens have already been arrested for rape, for sexual assault of a minor. Last month, local officials in Montgomery County released an accused criminal alien rapist back onto the streets, defying ICE's very powerful request to turn him over to them. In March, local officials in Durham County, North Carolina, ignored ICE and released an illegal alien arrested on felony robbery charges. A short time later, that same illegal alien was charged with murder of a 19-year-old woman in Georgia. This is happening, by the way, in over , these are stories I could , I could give you these stories all day long. I love the Angel Moms. I just love those women. I got , women and families , but I got to know a lot of them, what they've suffered and how they've suffered. And they're scorned by the radical Left. They're scorned. Who could scorn a person who lost their daughter put in an ashcan and burned? Stuffed into an ashcan and burned. And they find the person and it's like , who can , who can even , who could endure what they've been through? And it happens a lot. A few stories. It happens a lot. Far worse than what I'm telling you tonight. Far, far worse. Democrats believe our cities should be sanctuaries for violent criminal aliens. Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans. (Applause.) Democrats also believe any illegally alien who merely sets foot on U.S. soil should be automatically released into the interior of the United States and then given free healthcare for life. These craven policies impoverish U.S. communities while enriching human smugglers, traffickers, and vicious criminal cartels. Two hundred and eight House Democrats, nearly 90 percent of the Democrat Caucus, also voted against notifying ICE whenever an illegal alien tries to buy a gun. Meanwhile, Democrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans, so they're totally defenseless when somebody walks into their house with a gun. It's like, 'Whatever you want. Whatever you want. I'm defenseless. Whatever you want.' How crazy is this? Republicans will forever uphold the fundamental right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) Thank you. The agenda of the Democrat Party is the demolition of the American middle class, because that's what happens. Our Republican agenda is to make our neighborhoods safer, our families stronger, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. And we're on our way to doing it, but we have to win this next election. You know, I said the other day , and I don't know if anyone said it before, but it sounds like it should have been said many times before , but it's like a plant. You grow the plant. You put the plant in, but it hasn't really grabbed on yet. And it won't grab on; it needs a little time. We need a little time. We've done tremendous changes in our country. Tremendous changes. And we're going to do other changes. A lot of really great other changes. But we need that additional time to let it grab on, because they will destroy so much of what we've done, and we can't let that happen. You won't have energy. You won't have business. You won't have jobs. You won't have income. It will be a disaster. So you have to fight like hell. I tell the story of a man who hates me. One of the most successful businesspeople always hated me and I've always hated him. I can't stand that guy. (Laughter.) And I meet him recently and I see him, and he's working with my people on helping us out with fundraisers and everything. I say, 'What are you doing here?' 'I'm trying to help you get elected.' I said, 'You got to be kidding me.' And then, I looked at him and I said, 'But actually, you do have no choice.' Isn't it true? You don't have a choice. He said, 'No, I really respect what you've done over the last three years' , almost three years now , 'and I really respect, and it's been great for business, and it's been great for jobs. I have many more people working for me than I had when you became President. And it's really incredible what's happened.' And for the first time in my entire life, I really like this guy. (Laughter.) Although, he's a tough guy. He's a bad guy. But, no, he's one of many. I go to audiences , I was joking one time recently. I walked up to him; I said, 'Listen, I don't have to make a very long speech. You really have to elect me. Whether you like me or not, it makes no difference, because our country will go to hell. If any of these people get in, it will go to hell. So I'm going to leave now. Goodbye everybody.' And I joked. And then I came back and I talked. But I said, 'You know, I was joking, but I'm really not joking. You have no choice.' Because whoever they put in, the saner they are, the worse they're doing. And whoever they put in , and it looks like it's going to be a revolution to the Left , they're going to take your money. They're going to take , and very much hurt your families. I just don't think people can allow that to happen. We have a country that's doing, I think, better than ever before. The economy is the strongest it's ever been. Most powerful, our military , all of the things we've discussed. You have to fight so hard that we win this election. You have to fight so hard. I had a big meeting today on ethanol and the farmers, and it was an incredible meeting. And I sat around, and Chuck Grassley was there and Joni Ernst and John Thune and Mike Pounds and so many , just a whole group of great people. And just sitting around the room. Ben Sasse, who's actually become very good over the last year , we had a little arguments before, but doesn't matter , Ben Sasse was there. We had just a great group of people. And as were sitting in the Oval Office talking about farmers, I realized that all of these people have to make sure that we win because the farmers will be totally put out of business. Many businesses will be put out of business. I just don't even know what they're thinking. What are they doing? What are they doing? And I said to some of the people around the table, strong Republicans, but really people that just love the country. I said, 'You really have to make sure that we win, because if you don't, this country is in such trouble.' So I used to talk about 2016 as being a very important election, and it was. But in its own way, this is , I'll never say 'of' , of, you know, 'more important,' but I can almost say 'of equal importance' because everything that we've done, everything that we've gained , and the biggest gains are to come because the hard work of getting it approved. You people were involved with so much of it. It was so hard and we got things done. I mean, those tax cuts , all the things we did are so hard. We would have had healthcare done, and we will get it done if we get back the House and if we keep the Senate and keep the presidency, we'll get it done. We would have had healthcare done except for , (applause) , we had one little surprising vote late in the evening. But we would have had it done. We would have had it done, and we'll get it done. If we get back the House, we're going to get it done, as sure as you can be. But even on healthcare, we've done such a good job, and with the individual mandate and all of the other things we've been able to do. We're fighting for everyday citizens who work hard, pay their taxes, raise their children, follow our laws, serve our communities, respect our police, and believe in America with their every ounce, really, of their heart and their soul. We're fighting to protect their jobs, to defend their families, and to ensure their children can live the American Dream. You know, the Republican Party is actually loved in this country. And I think, in a certain way, loved like never before, because we they see that we're fighting for this country. We're fighting for what we grew up with. What , the values that we want. The Republican Party , you know, some people probably take it a little bit for granted, but you really are; you're loved out there. I see it. I see it all the time. Whenever I went , I saw it in North Carolina the other day. I'm backstage waiting to go on, and so many people have come up to me and they say, 'Sir, thank you for saving our nation.' Well, you're equal to me. What you , what you've done is incredible. Some of the things that you've done in a short period of time is pretty damn incredible. (Applause.) A nation's first duty is to care for its own citizens, and that is why we're working to give the American people a high-quality, low-cost , and this is what's going to happen , we want a low-cost healthcare system with more transparency and more choice. You know, we're doing transparency. I think you've all seen that. And a man came in who's an expert , he's a tremendous, tremendous man who I have a lot of respect for , and he said, 'Transparency.' I said, 'Explain transparency.' Sounds very simple. And I got it done. This is where people can go to hospitals and price, and they can pick their doctor. He said, 'Sir, this is bigger than any healthcare you can do. You watch.' And it will be put into effect , Secretary Azar, who's doing an incredible job , it will be put into effect fairly soon. We signed it about four months ago. It's being worked out. People are able to go in and negotiate the prices. You know, you have these horror stories where a woman will cut her hand and go into a hospital. You don't ask how much. But they'll go into a hospital and have the hand, and then they'll get billed $5,000. And they don't have $5,000. The horror stories are unbelievable. And we went through it. And some of you were in the room when I did signings. But we're having transparency, where you can have lists of prices. When you have some problem, they list it. You can go and negotiate prices. You can go to the drug store and say, 'Well, we want to see, how much is that? How much ' You know, right now you can't even do that. They don't let you do that. But now we do. And we've opened that up too. We've done a lot. Right to Try is something we've done a great job , you people have. (Applause.) You have to see the results on Right to Try. But a person can be terminally ill in the old system, and we could have a drug that we know works but is still going to take another year or two of testing, and we tell the person, 'I'm sorry, we can't let you use that drug because it may hurt you.' Well, you're going to die within three weeks or four weeks. You're terminally ill. They've wanted to do this for 45 years. And it's not as easy as all that. The country was worried that they'll sue the country. The doctors were worried they'd sue the doctors through the insurance companies, sue the pharmaceutical companies. I got everybody into a room. I said, 'Listen, what we do is we sign an agreement where we guarantee ' , and a tough agreement , ' where you guarantee that we have no liability, the doctor has no liability, the pharmaceutical company has no liability, and various other things.' I said, 'And everybody's happy.' Then they said, 'Well, we don't want them on the list.' If a person is terminally ill, the pharmaceutical companies , I understood that. 'We don't want them on our list.' Because they do a list of success. 'And when a person is very, very sick , maybe toward the end of their life, terminally ill , we don't want that person on our list as a sample, as a test sample.' I said, 'I understand that. So we're not going to have that person on your list. When you do this, we're not going to have that person on your list. We create a separate list of very, very sick, terminally ill people. But for your list, we're not going to put it.' They said, 'Wow, we like that.' And we got it signed. And you have to see the success. People used to go to Asia. They'd go to Europe. They'd go all over the world looking, if they had money. Most people didn't have the money, so they'd go home and they'd die. Now they have the Right to Try. And I congratulate you on that because you were the ones that really did a job. (Applause.) And Greg was great , wherever Greg may be. Is Greg here? Greg? Where's Greg? Oh, boy, you stood up fast. That's good. (Applause.) Thank you, Greg. I'd call Greg and I'd say, 'Man, you've got to get it done.' And it wasn't easy like people would've thought. Do you agree with that? That was not easy. We had more people coming at us , thank you very much, Greg. It was a fantastic job. And a lot of other folks in the room. That's why we're ending years of economic surrender and we're confronting China's chronic trading abuses. For years, past leaders let China freely loot our economy, racking up trillions and trillions of dollars in costly trade deficits. Now, the world is on notice that people aren't going to be able to do that to the United States anymore. They're not doing it anymore, and they know it. They know it. They get it. They come to me and they see me , the leaders. I know them all now, pretty much. Some I have great respect for. Some I don't get along with as well. You know, there was a poll recently that Obama is much more popular in Germany than I am. I said, 'Of course he is.' He's not saying to Germany, 'You've got to pay us for the military.' He's not saying to Germany, 'Why are you paying billions and billions of dollars to Russia for a pipeline coming in?' And then we defend , how about that one? We pay billions of dollars to Russia and then we defend Germany from Russia. Figure , does that work, right? (Laughter.) Does that work? Give Russia billions and then we defend you. Oh, that's a wonderful deal. We've got plenty of those deals. That's one of the better ones. With your help, we will also achieve a historic victory for the American farmer, rancher, and workers by replacing the horrible disaster , to me, one of the worst deals ever , NAFTA. And we're replacing it with the USMCA, which really is incredible. (Applause.) Got to get it up for a vote. They've got to put it up for a vote. By the way, the Democrats are going to vote for it. Unions love it. Farmers love it. I would say unions like it. But they like it. They hate NAFTA. It's their all-time least. Manufacturers love it. The farmers are desperate for it; it's so important. And let it be bipartisan. I told Nancy Pelosi. 'Nancy, put it up for a vote. It's going to bipartisan. You can have all the credit you want. You have to do something other than try and impeach somebody that didn't do anything wrong. You have to.' (Laughter.) I said, 'It's hard to impeach somebody who didn't do anything wrong.' The Mueller report is out. There's no collusion, after two and a half years. Think of it. How ridiculous: I collude with Russia. In fact, Russia said, 'You know, if we really did pick him, we made a real bad choice.' (Laughter.) Think of it. Even tonight, I'm talking about we have the strongest military. We're spending billions and billions. We're the strongest military, right? We have the strongest energy. Hillary wanted windmills. She wanted solar. Solar is fine , you know, small potatoes, compared to what we're talking about. It doesn't have the power that you need. And someday, good. I love solar. I think solar is good, but it's limited. The wind is very expensive because you put up those windmills , I know it very well. First of all, they're made in Germany and they're made in China. Think of the pollutants that go on the air when they're making these massive steel things. If it's anywhere near your house, your house is way down in value. Try dropping a windmill someplace close to your house. Try selling your house. They make noise. They kill all the birds. The energy is intermittent. If you happen to be watching the Democrat debate and the wind isn't blowing, you're not going to the see the debate. 'Charlie, what the hell happened to this debate?' (Laughter.) He says, 'Darling, the wind isn't blowing. The goddamn windmill stopped. That windmill stopped.' (Laughter.) Republicans know that American families are the true backbone of America. That is why I was the first President to propose nationwide paid family leave in my budget. Very important. (Applause.) Women want it. Our goal is to ensure that every American family enjoys an amazing quality of life. Together, we are going to fix our housing finance system. We're working on that very hard , to protect the dream of ownership for the next generation. We're going to make new cars more affordable and much safer. My administration will soon issue standards that will save families thousands and thousands, as I've said, of dollars per car. We're going to fight for the future of cities like Baltimore that have been destroyed by decades of failed and corrupt rule. (Applause.) The left-wing agenda of total government domination, crushing regulation, crippling taxes, unrestricted migration, and un- , and I mean, think of this , it's undermining all law enforcement. They undermine law enforcement and they devastate America's inner cities. They've been devastated. And even the cities like Los Angeles , look at what's happening. It's like , look at what's happening. San Francisco. Take a look at what's going on. And we're going to have to step in and do something about it because we can't allow that to happen to our great cities. Los Angeles is a great city. (Applause.) We can't allow it. And in the not-too-distant future, you're going to see. We're going to step in. We're not going to allow it to happen, where major, major companies are leaving their cities. They're leaving our country when they see that. You walk in. They pay a lot of rent. They walk into a beautiful building , the best street in California. And you have a site that nobody even can believe. Nobody can believe. And we're going to have to do something about it. And we will do something about it. We're going to give them notice. In fact, we gave them a notice a today: Clean it up. You got to do something. You can't have it. These are our great American cities and they're an embarrassment, what the Democrats have let happen. Republicans want to rebuild our inner cities and provide a future of limitless opportunity for all Americans. And Republicans believe that parents should have the right to send their kids to the school of their choice. (Applause.) So, just in concluding, in everything we do, Republicans are fighting for the values that bring us together as one nation, under God. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand up for the heroes of law enforcement. We reject globalism and we embrace patriotism. We believe that there is no treasure on Earth more valuable than our American citizenship. (Applause.) We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, cherish our heroes, and always respect our great American flag. (Applause.) These are the values that unite us tonight. These are the values that bind our country. These are the values the American people share, deep in their souls. And these are the values that Republicans will champion all across the land. And that's what's happening. And that's why people love what you're doing. That's why people are loving the Republican Party again. (Applause.) Our task is to be confident in these truths, certain of this vision, bold in our actions, and forever loyal to the citizens we serve. If we stay true to our mission , and we have to, and we have to stick together like they do. They've got nothing else on us, but, like I said, they stick together. If we remain firm in our convictions, if we always put America first, then there will be no limit to the progress that we will make, no bounds to the good that we will do, no ceiling on the heights that we will reach, and no end to the victories we will achieve. We will win, win, win. And we will keep on winning. You know, I tell that story and some people love it, and probably some don't, but I think they all love it. I'm going to win a place like , here we go. I'm going to use Dan as an example. I'm in North Carolina, and I'm going to say, 'We're going to win again. We're going to win so much.' Right, Dan? We're going to so much. We're going to win, win, win. (Applause.) And our country , you go back and we haven't been doing so much winning with trade and with all of these different things. And I'm going to go , I'm going to go to Dan Bishop, and I'm going to say, 'Dan, we're going to win.' And they're going to come in to see Dan. They're going to say, 'Please, please, stop the President from winning. We're winning so much. Dan, go visit. You're our new congressman. Go to the Oval Office. He respects you because, unlike these other people, he doesn't know you so well. So you are still respected.' (Laughter.) 'And please, see the President and talk to the President. Tell him to stop winning so much. We don't want to win so much in the great state of North Carolina.' And I'm going to say, 'Dan, I'm sorry. I'm not doing that. We're going to keep winning, winning, winning.' Right, Dan? We're going to keep winning, winning, winning. (Applause.) Congratulations. After all we've achieved and after everything that we've accomplished, our message is simple: The best is yet to come. (Applause.) The best is yet to come. Together, we will make America stronger, and safer, and prouder, and greater than ever before. And I want to thank everybody for being tonight. You are a terrific group and I know almost all of you. I like most of you. I know all of you. (Laughter.) No, you are. You're a terrific group, and I think we're going to have a terrific, long time together. And Kevin, and everybody, I want to thank you. This was an incredible evening. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)",

         "We're here today to celebrate and expand our historic campaign to rescue American workers from job-killing regulations. Before I came into office, American workers were smothered by a merciless avalanche of wasteful and expensive and intrusive federal regulation. These oppressive, burdensome mandates were a stealth tax on our people - slashing take-home pay, suppressing innovation, surging the cost of goods, and shipping millions of American jobs overseas - millions and millions and millions. It never ended. Nearly four years ago, we ended this regulatory assault on the American worker, and we launched the most dramatic regulatory relief campaign in American history by far. No other administration has done anywhere near. Thank you. At the heart of this effort was a revolutionary promise: For every one new regulation issued, we pledged that two federal regulations would be permanently removed. We not only met that ambitious goal - which, at the time, people said was impossible - we vastly exceeded it. For every one new regulation added, nearly eight federal regulations have been terminated. Been an incredible achievement. As you can see behind me, we have removed the gigantic, regulatory burden Americans have been forced to carry for decades, freeing our citizens to reach their highest potential. Our historic regulatory relief is providing the average American household an extra $3,100 every single year. And we're going up from that number. We're going up from that number. Think of that: $3,100 per household. Joining us today is Vice President Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Wilbur, thank you very much. Labor Secretary, Eugene Scalia. Thank you. Thank you, Gene. Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar. Thank you, Alex. Transportation Secretary, Elaine Chao. Thank you, Elaine. We had a great day in Georgia yesterday, cutting regulations like nobody has ever seen before. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you very much. OMB Acting Director, Russ Vought. Thank you, Russ. And Small Business Administrator - I love her name - Jovita Carranza. Jovita, thank you. Thank you. And CMS Administrator Seema Verma. Thank you, Seema. Great people. Those are great people. They do an incredible job. I also want to thank the many state and local, tribal leaders who join us in this great cause. Thank you very much, and thank you for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you all very much. What we have achieved together is truly without precedent - never happened before. The previous administration added over 16,000 pages of heavy-handed regulations to the Federal Register. That's why nothing got done. Under my administration, we have removed nearly 25,000 pages of job-destroying regulations - more than any other President by far in the history of our country, whether it was four years, eight years, or, in one case, more than eight years. The prior administration piled up more than 600 major new regulations - a cruel and punishing regulatory burden that cost the average American an additional $2,300 per year. Think of that: The average American, $2,300, regulation - hitting low-income Americans, by far, the hardest. These regulations also inflicted a steep economic toll on African American communities. By contrast, our reforms are putting more money into the pockets of hardworking Americans. In addition to saving every family more than $3,000 per year, my administration has just issued another reform that my Council of Economic Advisers estimates will lower the price of new vehicles by more than $2,200 per vehicle. And I think we're going to get that up to $3,500 per vehicle. It's very exciting. And, by the way, the vehicles will be better, they'll be stronger, and they'll be safer. Our regulation cuts are also delivering massive savings on broadband Internet services, and some home energy bills will be really historically cut - it's actually amazing - as well as historically low gasoline prices. Gasoline prices - you look today - I think it was $1.99. At the same time, we saved our oil companies - we're now the largest since we've been here - the largest energy source in the world. Nobody is even close. So it's great. But we saved them. They had a hard time a number of months ago - and, frankly, for a long time - but we've saved them. But $1.99, they were telling me - and, in some cases, lower than that. We're bringing back consumer choice in home appliances so that you can buy washers and dryers, showerheads and faucets. So showerheads - you take a shower, the water doesn't come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn't come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair - I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect. Dishwashers - you didn't have any water, so you - the people that do the dishes - you press it, and it goes again, and you do it again and again. So you might as well give them the water because you'll end up using less water. So we made it so dishwashers now have a lot more water. And in many places - in most places of the country, water is not a problem. They don't know what to do with it. It's called 'rain.' They don't have a problem. And old-fashioned incandescent lightbulbs - I brought them back. I brought them back. They have two nice qualities: They're cheaper and they're better. They look better, and they make you look so much better. That's important to all of us. But they're better and much cheaper. And they were mandated out, legislated out. And we brought them back, and they're selling like hotcakes. We stopped the egregious abuse of the Clean Water Act, which extreme activists have used to shut down construction projects all across our country. When I signed that legislation, I had many farmers and construction people standing behind me - people that haven't cried since they were a baby. Some of them never even when they were a baby, and they were crying. Many people were cry- - we gave them back their life. They took away their land. They took away their rights. They took away their life. By reining in EPA overreach, my administration has returned the agency to its core mission of ensuring clean air, clean water, and a truly pristine natural environment. Our air now and our water is as clean as it's been in the last four decades. Yesterday, our country achieved yet another groundbreaking milestone by completing a sweeping overhaul of America's badly broken infrastructure approval process. It was totally out of control. Instead of taking up to 20 years to approve a major project, we're cutting the federal permitting timeline - it's already been done - to a maximum of two years or less; in some cases, even less than one year. And it's possible that it won't qualify. It's possible that it won't be good environmentally or safety-wise, in which case, at least in a period of a year or two, we'll raise the hand and you won't make it. But most projects will make it, but you won't go for 10, 15, 18 or 20 years. There are many horror stories that we could relay. We're reclaiming America's proud heritage as a nation of builders. My administration has also eliminated massive regulatory barriers in our battle against the China virus. These actions save countless lives, speeding up the production of equipment. That means ventilators like nobody has ever seen before. Probably the greatest source of manufacturing, the greatest achievements since World War Two. We're now making ventilators for countries all over the world. And medicine - accelerating the delivery of lifesaving treatments and ensuring that we will have a vaccine in a record time. We're doing fantastically well on that. That'll be for another time, another meeting. But we are doing, on therapeutics and vaccines, incredibly well. No administration in history has removed more red tape more quickly to rescue the economy and to protect the health of our people. When you think of it, we are all set up; that as we get the vaccine or therapeutic - and we're set up, militarily - we're going to be delivering it in record time. It's all set to move. We put an investment upfront. And we have logistical people - generals, great people - they're going to be delivering this all over the country as soon as we have it. And we've made tremendous progress. You've been reading about it. In total, we've taken more than 740 actions to suspend regulations that would have slowed our response to the China virus. This includes lifting restrictions on manufacturers so that our great autoworkers could produce more than 100,000 ventilators. So we've done over 100,000 in 100 days. Think of that. And we didn't have ventilators. We weren't set up for ventilators. We became a country that's making a lot of them, helping so many others - countries that are never going to be in a position to make them. They're complex, they're expensive, they're big. Very, very, very tough to do. And we've saved a lot of lives. And there's never been a person in our country - even though we started with almost nothing; I say the cupboard was bare when we took over. We started with nothing. There's never been a person in our country - even though we had just absolutely no - we were - we were going on empty - never been one person that needed a ventilator that didn't get it. Think of that. Not one person - as complex as they are, as big, as expensive. Take a long time to get them done. Not one person has ever needed a ventilator that didn't get it. We made telemedicine - . Thank you. Great job. Great - really, a great job. The people here, they get no credit for it. I don't want any credit. They should get the credit, but they get no credit. But we've done a great job helping so many other countries now. We made telemedicine available to all American patients and allowed doctors to work across state lines. I will tell you, the telemedicine is something that's really gone up by thousands and thousands of percentage points of percent. Because what happened is people that wouldn't even think of using telemedicine, all of a sudden, started using it, and it's really turned out to be good. Really, really turned out to be good, and it solved a lot of problems. So that's something. There's been great advancement. Furthermore, I have ordered federal agencies to look for ways to make these healthcare reforms totally permanent. Vice President Pence is also working closely with state, local, and tribal leaders to streamline occupational licensing. Over 30 states have taken steps to reduce these barriers to unemployment and to employment, and - including a state that I love very much - I have a little history in that state - the great state of Alaska. Thank you very much, Governor, for being here. Mike Dunleavy. Mike, thank you very much. In Idaho, Governor Brad Little, who is here today with us as well, set a new record for regulatory relief. Good job, Brad. Good. Good governor. Great governor. Two great governors. The American people know best how to run their own lives. They don't need Washington bureaucrats controlling their every move and micromanaging their every decision. With each regulation we cut, we're not only returning the money and the power to our citizens, we are draining the Washington swamp, and they're not happy about it - I can tell you that. I think you know that. The swamp was deep. I just didn't know how deep. Deeper than I thought. Joining us today are a few of the countless Americans who are personally benefitting from our pro-worker reforms. Joe Cambria owns Cambria Truck Center in New Jersey - a good state, New Jersey - and it's been really something that he's seen firsthand how our regulation cuts have helped create thousands and thousands of jobs. Joe, please come up and say a few words. Thank you, Joe. Thank you very much. Thanks. Good job. Good job. That was easy, wasn't it? Huh? Thank you very much. Great job. Dr. Amy Johnson is a nurse practitioner in rural Virginia. Amy, please come up and share with us how important expanded healthcare and telehealth has been for you and your patients. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. So that's been a great help to you, telehealth. It's been an incredible - it's been an incredible thing. Great job. Thank you very much. Jim Chilton is a rancher from Arizona who was crushed by the Obama-Biden administration's ridiculous Waters of the United States rule - it's been a catastrophic rule, but it's gone now - which gave bureaucrats power to regulate every puddle on private land as though it were a lake. Jim, please come up and tell us of your experience, which I know wasn't a good one, but it's a good one now. Please. Thank you, Jim. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jim. That was my honor, Jim, and thank you very much. It's terrible. It was - that you had to suffer so long. They took your property away from you. And you want to take care of your property better than any government is going to tell you to take care of your property. You'll take care of it better, so we don't have to worry about that. Thank you very much. Beautifully said. Thank you. I want to just, as President, say that I will always fight to defend your rights and your freedoms. We'll fight very hard for your rights and your freedoms. The hard left wants to reverse these extraordinary gains and re-impose these disastrous regulations. They want to take what we've taken off, Jim, and they want to - they want to put them back on. And I guess they can do that. You'll fight them for a little while, but eventually you'll lose. And they want to bury our economy under suffocating, relentless landslides of Washington red tape like we had before I got here. We must never return to the days of soul-crushing regulation that ravaged our cities, devastated our workers, drained our vitality - and right out of our people - and thoroughly crippled our nation's prized competitive edge. It's what we have: We have great, great people. The greatest people in the world. Our entire economy and our very way of life are threatened by Biden's plans to transform our nation and subjugate our communities through the blunt-force instrument of federal regulation at a level that you haven't even seen yet. You think that was bad? You haven't even seen it yet. They want to go many times what they put you under in the past. Under the 'unity' platform Joe Biden published with socialist Bernie Sanders, they are proposing - and this is all in writing; it's done; they agreed - they are proposing to reenter the job-killing, unfair Paris Climate Accord, which will cost our country trillions of dollars - trillions and trillions of dollars - and put us in a very, very bad competitive position relative to the world. Not surprising to you, China will be greatly advanced under this ridiculous agreement, and so will Russia, so will many other countries. They propose to mandate net-zero emissions from all new homes and buildings, skyrocketing the cost of construction and putting the goal of homeownership out of reach for millions - destroying the look of the home, the beauty of the home. I'm somebody that's built many homes, many buildings. If you take a look at this, it doesn't look good. You still have to sell, right? You still have to sell. But they've put it out of reach, from a cost standpoint. Totally out of reach. It's not practical, it's not good, and it doesn't work. They want to eliminate carbon from the U.S. energy industry, which means abolishing all American oil, clean coal, and natural gas. No coal, no gas, no oil, nothing to fire our massive plants. The result of this federally mandated shutdown would be the wholesale destruction of the entire energy industry and many other industries, the economic evisceration of entire communities, and the unfettered offshoring of millions of our best jobs to foreign countries and foreign polluters. Millions and millions of jobs would go. Thousands and thousands of countries would be at a level that you've never seen. Companies would be disappearing left and right, just like they did with NAFTA, which we terminated for the USMCA, which was another beauty that we've done - not for now, but another great beauty. But thousands of companies, plants, factories would be closed. Under this dismal future, energy would be unaffordable for the vast majority of Americans, and the American Dream would be sniffed out so quickly and replaced with a socialist disaster. The Democrats in D.C. have been and want to, at a much higher level, abolish our beautiful and successful suburbs by placing far-left Washington bureaucrats in charge of local zoning decisions. They are absolutely determined to eliminate single-family zoning, destroy the value of houses and communities already built, just as they have in Minneapolis and other locations that you read about today. Your home will go down in value and crime rates will rapidly rise. Joe Biden and his bosses from the radical left want to significantly multiply what they're doing now. And what will be the end result is you will totally destroy the beautiful suburbs. Suburbia will be no longer as we know it. So they wanted to defund and abolish your police and law enforcement while at the same time destroying our great suburbs. The suburb destruction will end with us. Next week, I will be discussing the AFFH rule - AFFH rule, a disaster - and our plans to protect the suburbs from being obliterated by Washington Democrats, by people on the far left that want to see the suburbs destroyed, that don't care. People have worked all their lives to get into a community, and now they're going to watch it go to hell. Not going to happen, not while I'm here. The Biden-Bernie plan would also use the weapon of federal regulation to tie the hands of our police departments by abolishing cash bail - think of that. Think of that: bail. 'No problem. They killed somebody? Let them out.' Take a look at what's happening: Crime in New York City up 368 percent from just a short while ago. They got rid of a lot of police, and they're in the process of doing it a billion dollars. They probably want to abolish. It's not even believable. When I first heard about it, when you first heard about it, you didn't think it was real. You didn't think it was believable. Just like the Green New Deal. How crazy is that? But they're actually trying to put it into play. It'll mean the end of this country. So by getting rid of bail, they are incentivizing jail and prison closures - they want to get rid of prisons; they don't think anybody should go to prison - setting loose violent criminals; appointing left-wing social justice prosecutors, like you have in Philadelphia, where people creating and doing the most criminal of acts are let go, in many cases immediately, and making our wonderful cops - our great, great police, cops - subordinate to distant bureaucrats who have never spent a day in their lives fighting crime. Unlike the socialists, we believe in the rule of the people, not the rule of the unelected bureaucrats that don't know what they're doing. We believe in the dignity of the individual, not the iron grip of the state. Our regulatory reforms are vital not only to the success of our economy, but the strength of our democracy and the survival of liberty itself. My administration will continue pressing forward until we have made every last vestige of Washington fully, completely, and totally accountable to the citizens of the United States. We are putting our faith in the workers who power our country: the doctors who care for our country, the truckers who sustain our country, and the farmers and ranchers who preserve our country in all of its majestic beauty. The American people are the ones who made our nation great, and together, we will make it greater, by far, than ever before. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much for being with us. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. We must've said something right. I guess we said it absolutely right. It's about our country. It's about our country. We want to be strong, we want to respect everybody, but we have to have strong law enforcement. And that's taking place in the areas that we're responsible for. We want others to call us for help. There's nothing wrong. Let Chicago call. Let Seattle call. We were going into Seattle, all set to go, and then they did it themselves. They heard we were coming in, and the hands went up; they gave up. It's so terrible when you see what's happening. Minneapolis - we said, 'Get the guard in there.' Three nights: 'Get the guard in. Get the Guard.' We got the Guard in. The National Guard. They've done a fantastic job. As soon as they showed up, it was like a knife cutting through butter. You saw that, right? After four days of horror. It wasn't the police's fault in - in any of these places. They were told to leave. The police are, generally speaking, they do a great job. They were told to leave. But you saw what happened. Minneapolis - 'Grab - grab your gun and run.' That's not what they wanted to do. But the National Guard came in, and we did a great job. No problem after that, do you notice? We just passed a statues and monument executive order. And they were going wild. They - see that beautiful - look at it right there. It's so beautiful - the Washington Monument. If they had the choice, they'd take it down. And I guarantee you they'd rename it. They want to rename it. They want George Washington out. They want Thomas Jefferson out. They want Abraham Lincoln out. They want abolitionists out. They don't know what they want. They just want to destroy our country. We're not going to let it happen. We're not letting it happen. So I'd now like to ask Vice President Mike Pence to say a few words. Thank you, Mike. So we have many exciting things that we'll be announcing over the next eight weeks, I would say. Things that nobody has even contemplated, thought about, thought possible, and things that we're going to get done and we have gotten done - and we've started in most cases. But it's going to be a very exciting eight weeks, a eight weeks, like I prob- - I think, Mike, we can honestly say nobody has ever going to see eight weeks like we're going to have. Because we really have - we have - we're taking on immigration, taking on education, we're taking on so many aspects of things that people were hopelessly tied up in knots in Congress. They can't - they've been working on some of these things for 25, 30 years. It wasn't happening. But you'll see levels of detail, and you'll see levels of thought that a lot of people believed very strongly we didn't have in this country. We're going to get things done. We're going to get things done that they've wanted to see done for a long, long time. So I think we'll start sometime on Tuesday. We'll be discussing our one plan on suburbia, but that's one of many, many different plans. Then we're going into the immigration - the world of immigration, the world of education. We're going into the world of healthcare - very complete healthcare. And we have a lot of very exciting things to discuss. But cutting of regulation has been really something that I felt we could do, and we could do fairly easily. Nothing is easy in this country. We had statutory requirements where we'd do phase one, and then we'd have to wait 90 days. We'd do phase two, and we'd have to wait 60 days. You'd do phase three, and we're set - 'Let's do phase four, sir.' 'I'm sorry you have to wait one year.' But we were able to do things that nobody has ever been able to do, or even close, on deregulation. And these trucks - this really is a great - a great little example. I don't know who thought of this idea, but it's actually quite, quite simple and quite good. Is that Brooke? Quite simple and quite good. I don't love having that big sucker hanging over my head. I want to get out of here as fast as possible. But I do want to thank you all. Incredible people. You've done an incredible job. And to the speakers, please, thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.",

         "Thank you very much. Good morning. So I came here to do a meeting on infrastructure with Democrats, not really thinking they wanted to do infrastructure or anything else, other than investigate. And I just saw that Nancy Pelosi, just before our meeting, made a statement that 'We believe that the President of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.' Well, it turns out I'm the most , and I think most of you would agree to this , I'm the most transparent President, probably in the history of this country. We have given , on a witch hunt, on a hoax , the whole thing with Russia was a hoax, as it relates to the Trump administration and myself. It was a total horrible thing that happened to our country. It hurt us in so many ways. Despite that, we're setting records with the economy, with jobs. We have the most , most people employed today that we've ever had in the history of our country. We have the best unemployment numbers that we've had in the history of our country , in some cases, 51 years, but generally in the history of our country. Companies are moving back in. Things are going well. And I said, 'Let's have the meeting on infrastructure. We'll get that done easily.' That's one of the easy ones. And instead of walking in happily into a meeting, I walk in to look at people that had just said that I was doing a cover-up. I don't do cover-ups. You people know that probably better than anybody. And I was just looking at a list of some of the things that we just did: more than 2,500 subpoenas qualified for. And I let everybody talk. I let the White House Counsel speak for 30 hours. Thirty hours. I have 19 Special Counsel lawyers; 40 FBI agents. I said, 'Open it all up. Let them have whatever they want.' Nearly 500 search warrants. Think of that: a search warrant. Did you ever see a search warrant before? Neither did I. This was over 500 search warrants. And of the 19 people that were heading up this investigation, or whatever you want to call it, with Bob Mueller, they were contributors to the Democrat Party, most of them, and to Hillary Clinton. They hated President Trump. They hated him with a passion. They went to her big party after the election that turned out to be a wake, not a party. It was a wake. And they were very angry. These are the people that, after two years and 40 million or 35 million dollars , it'll end up being a lot more than that by the time all the bills are paid , this is what happened. No collusion. No obstruction. No nothing. They issued 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers. Think of that, though. Five hundred witnesses. And then I have Nancy Pelosi go out and say that the President of the United States engaged in a cover-up. Now, we've had a House investigation. We have Senate investigations. We have investigations like nobody has ever had before. And there's nothing , we did nothing wrong. They would have loved to have said we colluded. They would have loved it. These people were out to get us, the Republican Party and President Trump. They were out to get us. This was a one-sided, horrible thing. The bottom line is they said there's no collusion. No collusion with Russia. You heard so much talk about phone calls that my son made to me from this meeting that was set up by GPS Fusion, it looks like , which is the other side, for those that don't know. And for a year, I heard about phone calls went to a special number unauthorized. And it would have been my son, Don , who's a good young man, who's gone through hell. And they were calls that must have been made by him before and after the meeting , three calls. After massive study and work, they actually found who made the calls. One was a friend of ours , a real estate developer. Great guy. Most of you know him. Nice guy. He loves our country. And the other one was the head of NASCAR. Two of them. So, of the three calls that were so horrible that he had a meeting and he called me and then he had the meeting after and he made two more calls , and they were written about like this little , little lines, couple of lines. Nobody wanted to admit it. Even last night, we had a great election. I went there on Monday. We had a , an election for Fred Keller. It was a 50/50 shot, and he won in a landslide. We went and we did a rally. Hardly mentioned today. And yet, if he lost, it would have been the biggest story in the country , even bigger than this witch hunt stuff that you guys keep writing about. So here's the bottom line: There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. We've been doing this since I've been President. And, actually, the crime was committed on the other side. We'll see how that all turns out. I hope it turns out well. But to my way of thinking , and I know a lot of you agree with me , the crime was committed on the other side. This whole thing was a take-down attempt at the President of the United States. And, honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves for the way you report it so it dishonestly , not all of you, but many of you. The way you report it. So I've said from the beginning, right from the beginning, that you probably can't go down two tracks. You can go down the investigation track, and you can go down the investment track or the track of 'Let's get things done for the American people.' I love the American people. Drug prices are coming down , first time in 51 years , because of my administration. But we can get them down way lower working with the Democrats. We can solve the problem on the border in 15 minutes if the Democrats would give us a few votes. So I just wanted to let you know that I walked into the room and I told Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi, 'I want to do infrastructure. I want to do it more than you want to do it. I'd be really good at that. That's what I do. But you know what? You can't do it under these circumstances. So get these phony investigations over with.' The Wall Street Journal just wrote today , just a little while ago, I saw it: 'Mr. Mueller wasn't obstructed in any way.' This is a Wall Street Journal editorial today. 'Mr. Mueller wasn't obstructed in any way. His copious report ' , copious , 434 pages. Now they want to interview all of the same people again. They want to interview Jerry Nadler, who's been an enemy of mine for many years. He fought me in New York , unsuccessfully, by the way. I've had great success against Jerry. But he was representing Manhattan, and he would fight me all the time on the West Side railroad , many times, very unsuccessfully. He failed. I come to Washington. I've become President. And I said, 'Oh, no, I have Jerry Nadler again?' So Wall Street Journal: 'Mr. Mueller wasn't obstructed in any way. His copious report was released for all to see, and there was no collusion ' , this is the Wall Street Journal , ' and there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.' That's it. But they want to make this a big deal. Whether or not they carry the big 'I' word out , I can't imagine that, but they probably would because they'd do whatever they have to do. I'll tell you, there's a danger here. If someday a Democrat becomes President, and you have a Republican House, they could impeach him for any reason , or her. Any reason. We can't allow that to happen. We can't allow it to happen. So when you look at all of the transparency, when you look at all I've done , and I will tell you, my lawyers say, 'You don't have to do this. You can use presidential privilege. You don't have to let your lawyers and all of your staff testify. You can use presidential privilege, sir.' 'Would you recommend it?' 'Well, you can be transparent or you can be tight. Being , if you've done nothing wrong, being transparent is better.' So I said, 'I did nothing wrong. Let's be transparent.' So that's what you have. All of these things , look at that , all of these things. Five hundred witnesses that I allowed to testify. It's a disgrace. So when they get everything done, I'm all set to , let's get infrastructure. Let's get drug prices down. In the meantime, we're doing tremendous work without them. We're doing tremendous executive orders. A lot of work. We've had a great success. Most successful economy, perhaps, in our country's history. We've cut regulations at a level that nobody else has cut them before. The largest tax cut in the history of the country. So we're doing a lot of work. Steve? Yeah.",

         "Good morning. My fellow Americans, this morning, our nation is overcome with shock, horror, and sorrow. This weekend, more than 80 people were killed or wounded in two evil attacks. On Saturday morning, in El Paso, Texas, a wicked man went to a Walmart store, where families were shopping with their loved ones. He shot and murdered 20 people, and injured 26 others, including precious little children. Then, in the early hours of Sunday morning in Dayton, Ohio, another twisted monster opened fire on a crowded downtown street. He murdered 9 people, including his own sister, and injured 27 others. The First Lady and I join all Americans in praying and grieving for the victims, their families, and the survivors. We will stand by their side forever. We will never forget. These barbaric slaughters are an assault upon our communities, an attack upon our nation, and a crime against all of humanity. We are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil, the cruelty, the hatred, the malice, the bloodshed, and the terror. Our hearts are shattered for every family whose parents, children, husbands, and wives were ripped from their arms and their lives. America weeps for the fallen. We are a loving nation, and our children are entitled to grow up in a just, peaceful, and loving society. Together, we lock arms to shoulder the grief, we ask God in Heaven to ease the anguish of those who suffer, and we vow to act with urgent resolve. I want to thank the many law enforcement personnel who responded to these atrocities with the extraordinary grace and courage of American heroes. I have spoken with Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, as well as Mayor Dee Margo of El Paso, Texas, and Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, to express our profound sadness and unfailing support. Today, we also send the condolences of our nation to President Obrador of Mexico, and all the people of Mexico, for the loss of their citizens in the El Paso shooting. Terrible, terrible thing. I have also been in close contact with Attorney General Barr and FBI Director Wray. Federal authorities are on the ground, and I have directed them to provide any and all assistance required , whatever is needed. The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate. In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart, and devours the soul. We have asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism , whatever they need. We must recognize that the Internet has provided a dangerous avenue to radicalize disturbed minds and perform demented acts. We must shine light on the dark recesses of the Internet, and stop mass murders before they start. The Internet, likewise, is used for human trafficking, illegal drug distribution, and so many other heinous crimes. The perils of the Internet and social media cannot be ignored, and they will not be ignored. In the two decades since Columbine, our nation has watched with rising horror and dread as one mass shooting has followed another , over and over again, decade after decade. We cannot allow ourselves to feel powerless. We can and will stop this evil contagion. In that task, we must honor the sacred memory of those we have lost by acting as one people. Open wounds cannot heal if we are divided. We must seek real, bipartisan solutions. We have to do that in a bipartisan manner. That will truly make America safer and better for all. First, we must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs. I am directing the Department of Justice to work in partisan , partnership with local, state, and federal agencies, as well as social media companies, to develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike. As an example, the monster in the Parkland high school in Florida had many red flags against him, and yet nobody took decisive action. Nobody did anything. Why not? Second, we must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence. We must stop or substantially reduce this, and it has to begin immediately. Cultural change is hard, but each of us can choose to build a culture that celebrates the inherent worth and dignity of every human life. That's what we have to do. Third, we must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment, but, when necessary, involuntary confinement. Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun. Fourth, we must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms, and that, if they do, those firearms can be taken through rapid due process. That is why I have called for red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. Today, I am also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty, and that this capital punishment be delivered quickly, decisively, and without years of needless delay. These are just a few of the areas of cooperation that we can pursue. I am open and ready to listen and discuss all ideas that will actually work and make a very big difference. Republicans and Democrats have proven that we can join together in a bipartisan fashion to address this plague. Last year, we enacted the STOP School Violence and Fix NICS Acts into law, providing grants to improve school safety and strengthening critical background checks for firearm purchases. At my direction, the Department of Justice banned bump stocks. Last year, we prosecuted a record number of firearms offenses. But there is so much more that we have to do. Now is the time to set destructive partisanship aside , so destructive , and find the courage to answer hatred with unity, devotion, and love. Our future is in our control. America will rise to the challenge. We will always have and we always will win. The choice is ours and ours alone. It is not up to mentally ill monsters; it is up to us. If we are able to pass great legislation after all of these years, we will ensure that those who were attacked will not have died in vain. May God bless the memory of those who perished in Toledo. May God protect them. May God protect all of those from Texas to Ohio. May God bless the victims and their families. May God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.",

THEY ALWAYS START OFF, SIR, CONGRATULATIONS ON THE GREAT JOB YOU'VE DONE WITH THE ECONOMY. HAD OUR OPPONENTS GOT ELECTED, YOU WOULD WRITE NOW BE THE NUMBER TWO ECONOMY TO CHINA AND WE ARE NOW SO FAR AHEAD. IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN IF SMART PEOPLE ARE STANDING HERE. WE'VE ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY. WITH YOUR HELP, RIGHT HERE IN LOUISIANA, THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF NATURAL GAS. THEY WANT TO GO TO WIND. I JUST CAN'T WATCH THE SHOW TONIGHT, THE WIND STOPPED FLOWING. I CAN'T STOP , WATCH LSU AND FLORIDA. THERE WAS NO WIND TODAY. I'M REALLY ANGRY AT JOHN BEL EDWARDS. HE HAS NOT DONE THE. BEST IN THE JOB. , HE HAS NOT DONE THE JOB. WE ARE RESTORING THE UNRIVALED FIGHT , MIGHT OF THE U.S. , MILITARY LIKE NEVER BEFORE. BY THE WAY, WE WILL INTRODUCE SOME GREAT SENATORS HERE TONIGHT, YOU HAVE GREAT CONGRESSMAN. WE APPROVED SOMETHING CALLED VETERANS TWICE. , CHOICE. THE VETERANS CAN SEE A DOCTOR OUTSIDE OF THE V.A. IF THEY HAD TO WAIT TWO WEEKS OR THREE DAYS. THEY CAN GO AND SEE A DOCTOR. WE PAY THE BILL. THEY GET BETTER. PEOPLE WERE WAITING FOR SIX MONTHS. OUR VETERANS, WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS. YOU NOTICE THAT, WITH THE VETERANS? IT USED TO BE ALL THE TIME, EVERY TIME, WHERE'S THE VETERAN? HOW ARE YOU, SIR? HE LOOKS LIKE A VETERAN, TOO. NOT GOING TO MESS WITH HIM. GREAT. DO YOU NOTICE, WE DON'T SEE THE BAD STORIES ABOUT THE VETERANS. THE FAKE NEWS WILL GO OUT ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES. THEY WILL LOOK. NBC IS ONE OF THE WORST IN THE WORLD. THEY WILL LOOK. THEY WILL LOOK FOR A VETERAN. THEY WILL FIND A VETERAN THAT IS NOT 100% HAPPY. THEY WILL MAKE THEM A STAR. DO YOU NOTICE? FOR A YEAR AND A HALF, WE'VE BEEN IN GREAT SHAPE. THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE VETERANS. THEY WORK FAST. THEY DON'T MESS AROUND IN LOUISIANA, DO THEY? THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE TO SEE IT. OUR POLICE ARE GREAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT, GREAT. FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS, DEMOCRATS HAVE WAGED A NONSTOP BATTLE TO OVERTURN YOUR VOTE, OVERRULE YOUR VOICE, OVERRIDE YOUR VALUES, AND OVERTHROW THE RESULTS OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 2016. YOUR SENATORS AND YOUR CONGRESSMEN, THE REAL SENATORS AND REAL CONGRESSMEN AND WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY, THEY ARE NOT STANDING , THE GOOD PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA WILL NEVER STAND FOR IT. IT'S A HOAX. THE DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING TO RESTORE THE RIGID POLITICAL CLASS THAT THROUGH OPEN OUR NATION'S BORDERS, SHIPPED AWAY OUR JOBS, SACRIFICED OUR WEALTH, SURRENDERED OUR SOVEREIGNTY, FLOODED OUR CITIES WITH DRUGS AND CRIME, AND BOGGED US DOWN IN ONE FOREIGN WAR AFTER ANOTHER. THE ENDLESS WARS HAVE TO STOP. WE ARE DIRECTLY TAKING ON THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE OF CORRUPT DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS, DEEP STATE BUREAUCRATS, AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. THERE THEY ARE RIGHT THERE. IT'S REALLY FUNNY. I SEE ALL THOSE RED LIGHTS. THAT MEANS YOU ARE LIVE, RIGHT? AS SOON AS I START TALKING ABOUT THE FAKE NEWS, I SEE THOSE LIGHTS GO OFF SO FAST. BUT THEN THEY COME BACK ON. YOU KNOW WHY THEY COME BACK ON? LAST NIGHT, BY FAR, ALL OVER CABLE, THE HIGHEST-RATED SHOW WAS WHAT WE DID IN MINNESOTA, A STATE WE ARE GOING TO WIN. THAT'S WHY THEY COME BACK ON. THEY HAVE NO CHOICE. THEY MAY HATE TRUMP BUT THEY WANT TO GET THOSE RATINGS. HEY, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND 12, 16 YEARS WHEN I'M NO LONGER PRESIDENT? THE RATINGS ARE GOING TO TANK. I ACTUALLY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO ENDORSE ME. HE SLIDES INTO THE UKRAINE, HE FLIES INTO UKRAINE, HE WALKS OUT WITH $168,000 A MONTH. $3 MILLION. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT A GASOLINE TANK LOOKS LIKE. THEY ARE PAYING HIM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MONTH. HE SLIDES INTO CHINA AND HE TAKES OUT $1.5 BILLION. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I MADE A GREAT CHINA DEAL TODAY FOR ENERGY, FOR THE FARMERS. FOR THE BANKS. FOR SOME MANY, TECHNOLOGY IS ONE OF THE GREATS. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM, IT WILL BE $50 BILLION IN BOND PURCHASES. I DON'T THINK OUR FARMERS CAN PRODUCE THAT MUCH. I SAID, THAT'S OK. SHOULD WE MAKE IT 20? I SAID, MAKE IT 50. OUR FARMERS WILL BUY MORE LAND AND THEY WILL BUY BIGGER TRACTORS. THEY ACTUALLY SAID, I WANT MY FARMERS. I WANT THEM TO COME BACK. WE CAN PRODUCE THIS, IT'S TOO MUCH. WE CAN'T PRODUCE THAT MUCH. I WANT TO TELL YOU, I GOT CHINA TO ORDER A LOT. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE CHINA, IN THEIR RECORD YEAR, THEY WILL CATCH IT. SHIFT GOT FOUR PINOCCHIO'S FOR MAKING UP WHAT I SAID ON THE PHONE CALL. THE BIGGEST YEAR WAS $60 BILLION IN AGRICULTURAL. THAT'S A LOT OF CORN. 16 BILLION WAS THE BIGGEST YEAR. THEY ARE GOING TO BUY 40-50 BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF AGRICULTURE. MY PEOPLE SAID TO ME, THEY CAN'T DO IT. THEY CANNOT PRODUCE THAT MUCH. I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, MY PEOPLE WANTED TO STOP IT 20. I SAID, I'M NOT STOPPING AT 20. I WANT THEM TO COME BACK AND SAY, SIR, WE CAN'T DO IT. I LOVE MY FARMERS. THEY WILL BE AT THEIR BUSY , OUT THERE. THERE WILL BE MORE TRACTORS SOLD. THEY WILL BE BIGGER AND BETTER AND MORE POWERFUL. THEY WILL BE MADE BY AMERICAN COMPANIES LIKE JOHN DEERE. FOR YOUR SENATORS AND YOUR CONGRESSMAN THAT ARE HERE, THAT WAS ONE HELL OF A DEAL. THIS WAS PHASE ONE. YOU HAVE TO SEIZE THESE , SEE THESE. THEY'RE HAPPY TO DO IT. WE HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. LET ME GET BACK TO BIDEN. RIGHT? HE WALKED OUT OF CHINA. HE WALKS OUT WITH $1.5 BILLION. I SAID, YOU KNOW, THOSE AREN'T THE SAME GUYS I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH FROM CHINA FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. THOSE GUYS DON'T GIVE YOU 1.5 BILLION IF YOU KNOW NOTHING. THAT'S NOT THE SAME CHINESE PEOPLE I WANT TO MEET. INSTEAD OF $50 BILLION, IT WOULD BE $500 BILLION WORTH OF CORN. IT'S A CROOKED DEAL. THE FAKE NEWS IS ALWAYS COVERING IT. RIGHT? THE FAKE NEWS. THEY GO, THE CLAIM IS UNSUBSTANTIATED. WITH ME, AN , ANY CLAIM IS OK. WITH THEM, WHY THE CLAIM IS TOTALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED. I SAY, IT'S NOT UNSUBSTANTIATED. HE TOOK A FORTUNE OUT OF UKRAINE AND DID NOTHING. HE TOOK A FORTUNE OUT OF CHINA. HOW TOUGH IS CHINA? I CALLED ONE OF THE BIGGEST PEOPLE ON WALL STREET. ONE OF MY BIG, POWERFUL GUYS. I SAID, LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF DOING THAT? HE SAID, ZERO. I SAID, YOU ARE THE BIGGEST ON WALL STREET, STEVE. YOU ARE THE BIGGEST. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES YOU CAN DO THAT? HE SAID, EVEN THE BIG ONES CAN'T DO THAT. FOR A GUY TO WALK IN OFF THE STREET WITH NO EXPERIENCE, A BAD TRACK RECORD, JUST GOT THROWN OUT OF THE NAVY. HE WALKS AWAY WITH 1.5 BILLION. THESE CROOKED PEOPLE SAY, THIS IS TOTALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THEY WALKED OUT WITH $1.5 BILLION? THEY WOULDN'T BE SAYING, TOTALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED. THEY WOULD BE SAYING, WHERE'S THE NEAREST CELL? THIS IS A HORRIBLE THING. IT'S A DISGRACE WHAT'S GOING ON. IT'S A WHOLE BIG FAT DISGRACE. IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO REPUBLICANS. YOU KNOW WHY? WE ARE HERE AND THEY ARE NOT. THE DEMOCRATS AND THE MEDIA, THEY ARE PARTNERS. THEY ARE PARTNERS. OK? YOU EVER SEE , WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. THEY ARE SAYING IT'S A MANUFACTURED CRISIS. THEY SAID IT WAS NOT A CRISIS. YOU HAD CARAVAN'S, WE STOPPED IT. THE WALL IS BEING BUILT LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. REMEMBER A FEW MONTHS AGO? A MANUFACTURED CRISIS ON ABC. NBC. ABC AGAIN, MANUFACTURED. CNN, CROOKED AS HELL. A MANUFACTURED CRISIS. CBS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN A MANUFACTURED CRISIS. IT'S A WORD THAT WAS NEVER USED. NOW EVERYTHING ON NETWORK , EVERY SINGLE NETWORK USED IT. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S COLLUSION. IT'S COLLUSION. THAT'S THE REAL COLLUSION. WITH US, THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. THAT'S THE REAL COLLUSION RIGHT THERE. THEY COLLUDED AND THEY CONSPIRED TO SABOTAGE OUR INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT. THEY WANT TO DECEIVE THE AMERICAN VOTER. THEY WANT TO HURT THE AMERICAN VOTER. WE HAD AN ELECTION. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A GREATER VICTORY THAN THE VICTORY WE HAD IN 2016. WE WILL HAVE A BIGGER ONE IN 2020. THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO STOP US FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS WITH A LOT OF CRACK , CR AP. THE FIRST FROM , TIME I HEARD ABOUT RUSSIA, THEY SAID, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RUSSIA? NO. HAVE YOU COLLUDED WITH RUSSIA? I LAUGHED. I THOUGHT THEY WERE KIDDING. SOME OF THE IS CAME UP. THE YOU KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT RUSSIA? NO. I KNOW WHERE IT IS. I DON'T DEAL WITH IT. I TOLD THE GUYS 12 YEARS AGO, HE WAS FROM RUSSIA. I DON'T KNOW. THEY COME UP AGAIN. SIR, RUSSIA KEEPS COMING UP. DINO ANYTHING ABOUT IT? IT'S A WITCHHUNT. THIS IS THE INSURANCE POLICY. THIS WAS THE INSURANCE POLICY. REMEMBER? FROM THE TWO LOVERS. IF SHE DOESN'T WIN, WE HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY. THESE PEOPLE ARE CORRUPT. THESE PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTING. THE TWO LOVERS. THEY PUT IT ON THE FBI SERVER. SO THEIR SPOUSES WOULDN'T FIND OUT. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PUT IT ON THEIR PRIVATE. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL FOR THEM, DID IT? LISA, I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU LISA. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH I CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT. LISA. SHE WILL WIN 100 MILLION. JUST IN CASE, MY DARLING, I LOVE YOU. JUST IN CASE SHE DOESN'T WIN, WE HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY. WE WILL TAKE HIM OUT. HE'S A CORRUPT , THESE ARE CORRUPT PEOPLE, FOLKS. SHE SAID, PETER, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. YOU ARE SO GREAT. I DON'T THINK SHE LOVES HIM TOO MUCH ANYMORE, DO YOU? I HEAR THE WORD IS NOT TOO GOOD. THE WORD IS SHE'S NOT IN LOVE ANYMORE. WE'VE BEEN LIVING THROUGH THIS SO-CALLED INSURANCE POLICY BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE ARE PUTTING A STOP TO THEIR PILLAGING AND PLUNDERING AND HOAXES. THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS POLICIES ARE CRAZY. THE POLITICIANS ARE CORRUPT. THEIR CANDIDATES ARE TERRIBLE. THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T WIN AN ELECTION SO THEY ARE PURSUING AN ILLEGAL, INVALID, AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL BULLSHIT IMPEACHMENT. THEY ARE SCAMMERS AND CON ARTISTS. PERPETRATING HOAXES AND WITCHHUNTS. A MAN LIKE GREG GERRIT, GREAT GUY. HE WROTE A BOOK AND THE BOOK TELLS YOU THE WHOLE STORY. BESTSELLER BOOK. GREAT GUY. SO MANY. SO MANY. HE'S NOT A LAWYER BUT HE'S BETTER THAN THE LAWYERS. HE'S CALLED STREETSMART. SO MANY GREAT PEOPLE. JOHN SULLIVAN HOW ABOUT THESE FRAUDULENT WRITERS OF THE NEW YORK TIMES? THEY HAVE TO GIVE BACK THEIR PULITZER PRIZE. THAT IS A FIX. I JUST WON THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR TALKING ABOUT TRUMP AND RUSSIA. PEOPLE WERE RIGHT, LIKE SEAN HANNITY. RUSH LIMBAUGH. LAURA INGRAHAM AND TUCKER CARLSON. JUDGE JEANINE. AND FRANKLY, THE BEST SHOW BY FAR IN THE MORNING IS FOX AND FRIENDS. HOW ABOUT LOU DOBBS? VARNEY IS GREAT. AND MARIA BARTIROMO. MANY OTHERS. WHY AREN'T THESE PEOPLE GETTING THE REAL FULL OF SURPRISE? THEY WERE RIGHT. THEY CALLED IT RIGHT. THE TIMES, THE WASHINGTON POST, THEY ARE DISHONEST, HORRIBLE. I THINK VERY BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. IT IS A PHONY DEAL. THERE WRITERS GET FULL OF SURPRISES , PULLITZER PRIZES. THE ONES THAT REALLY GOT IT RIGHT GO HOME EMPTY-HANDED. THANK GOD WE HAVE THEM ON OUR SIDE. THANK GOD THAT WE HAVE A THING CALLED SOCIAL MEDIA. WE GET THE WORD OUT. LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER GOTTEN THE WORD OUT BEFORE. IT IS CALLED A WITCHHUNT. THIS STORY OF THE GREATEST MASS DELUSION IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY. THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT KHAN JOBS EVER. WE MUST NEVER LET IT HAPPEN TO ANOTHER PRESIDENT. THEY NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO RELEASE THE TRANSCRIPT OF MY CALL. THE WHISTLEBLOWER WHO WORKS FOR BIDEN. HE COMES OUT WITH A TOTALLY PHONY REPORT ON MY PHONE CALL. THEY NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD RELEASE IT. SO THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE OK. IT SOUNDED HORRIBLE. THAT IS WHY I HAD TO RELEASE IT. THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE CAME OUT AND SAID HE DID NOTHING WRONG. HE GOT ELECTED ON AN ANTICORRUPTION PLATFORM. UKRAINE IS KNOWN UNFORTUNATELY AS A VERY CORRUPT PLACE. THE FAKE NEWS HARDLY PUTS THEM ON. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. NOBODY THOUGHT WE WOULD RELEASE THE CALL. NOBODY KNEW WE HAD A TRANSCRIPT. WHEN I HEARD THE VICIOUSNESS, WORSE THAN THE WHISTLEBLOWER. WHY ARE WE PROTECTING A PERSON THAT TELLS YOU THINGS THAT ARE TRUE? SHIFTY SCHIFF, LITTLE ADAM SCHIFF, I HAVE HAD YOU UP TO HERE. HE COMES OUT AND HE MAKES UP MY CONVERSATION. I WAS WATCHING BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK THAT IS WHAT HE SAID. NERVOUS NANCY. I USED TO THINK SHE LOVES THE COUNTRY, SHE HATES THE COUNTRY. NANCY PELOSI HATES THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SHE WOULD NOT BE DOING THIS. FOREIGN PEOPLE LOOKING AT US, THEY HONESTLY THINK WE ARE NUTS. SHE WAS ANGRY WHEN SHE GOT TO READ THE TRANSCRIPT. THAT IS NOT WHAT SHE WAS TOLD. BUT SHE WAS STUCK. THINK OF A GUY WHO MAKES UP A PHONE CALL. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE THEIR FACES. HE GOES BEFORE CONGRESS AND MAKES UP THE STORY OF WHAT I SAID. HE MADE IT UP. IT WAS FICTION. ARE YOU IMMUNE FROM SOMETHING LIKE THAT? THAT SHOULD BE A CRIME. I NEED YOU TO SEND THE DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT A CLEAR MESSAGE, YOU'RE GOING TO FIRE YOUR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR WHO HAS DONE A LOUSY JOB. AND SUNDAY GREAT REPUBLICAN TO THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION. WHEN JOHN BEL EDWARDS RAN FOR OFFICE, HE MADE YOUR STATE A SACRED PROMISE THAT HE WOULD NOT RAISE YOUR TAXES. THEN HE GOT ELECTED AND BROKE THAT PROMISE BY RAMMING THROUGH THE LARGEST TAX HIKE IN YOUR STATE'S HISTORY. BECAUSE THE STATE LIKES ME, I THINK I ONE BY A LOT. , WON BY A LOT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THE HELL YOU LIKE A GUY. BUT I LIKE YOU GUYS TOO. I USED TO GO TO CONSTRUCTION SITES WHERE PEOPLE WOULD BE PUTTING UP HOUSING. I LIKE THOSE WORKERS. JOHN BEL EDWARDS LIED TO THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA. EDWARDS IS TRYING TO DESTROY LOUISIANA'S ENERGY SECTOR. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? WITH THREATS AND LAWSUITS INSPIRED BY THE RADICAL LEFT-WING DEMOCRATS. THAT IS WHAT HE IS DOING. HE IS NOT GOOD. HE GOES AROUND SAYING HE LIKES ME VERY MUCH. BUT BEHIND MY BACK, HE DOES NOT LIKE ME. HE WAS A SUPERDELEGATE FOR CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON. IT LOOKS LIKE BERNIE LOST HIS CHANCE. BERNIE WAS HITTING A BASEBALL TODAY TO SHOW HOW STRONG HE WAS. THEY'RE JUST THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF BAT SPEED. BERNIE, GET BETTER. IT IS THE ONLY TIME I'VE EVER SAID ANYTHING GOOD ABOUT HIM. BOY DID THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIM FOR YEARS AGO AND THEY LET HIM DO IT. , HE LET THEM DO IT. HE FIGURED HE WOULD WAIT FOR YEARS. WHEN BERNIE GETS OUT, IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE WILL GO TO YOUR RADICAL LEFTISTS ELIZABETH WARREN. THAT WILL BE THE END OF SLEEPY JOE. HE IS WHO I WOULD LIKE TO RUN AGAINST. I DON'T CARE. JUST PUT THEM OUT THERE. LET'S GET THIS THING GOING. OUR FRIEND BRIAN KEMP DID A NUMBER ON STACEY ABRAMS. SHE HAD OPRAH. OPRAH DID A TEST USED TO BE A REALLY BIG FRIEND OF MINE. SHE USED TO GO TO MAR-A-LAGO. SHE LIKES THE KEY LIME PIE. SHE WENT TO GEORGIA AND SHE CAMPAIGNED FOR STACEY ABRAMS. THE OBAMAS WENT. ALL BRIAN KEMP HAD WAS DONALD TRUMP. WE HAD A RALLY AT THE AIRPORT. 55,000 PEOPLE THERE. HE WON BY 2.5 POINTS. THAT WAS AMAZING. EVERY STAR WENT DOWN THERE FOR STACEY ABRAMS. LOUISIANA CANNOT TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR RAISING YOUR TAXES, KILLING YOUR JOBS, ATTACKING YOUR INDUSTRY, AND TAKING MONEY FROM OPEN BORDERS. HOW ABOUT THESE PEOPLE WHO WANT OPEN BORDERS? LET EVERYONE COME IN. TOMORROW YOU HAVE TO VOTE JOHN BEL EDWARDS OUT. AND THE WAY YOU DO THAT IS BEFORE THE GAME, YOU GOT TO GET GOING. JUST LEAVE AN HOUR EARLY. MAYBE AN HOUR EARLY. IT IS A RUNOFF. IF HE DOES NOT GET 50%, THEN ONE OF OUR TWO GREAT CANDIDATES WILL WIN. IT WILL BE JOHN BEL EDWARDS AGAINST ONE OF OUR TWO GREAT CANDIDATES. THEY ARE BOTH GREAT PEOPLE. THEY ARE BOTH PRO-JOBS, PRO-WORKERS, PROFAMILY, PRO-LIFE. AND PRO-LOUISIANA ENERGY. IF THAT IS OK. I WAS HERE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND THEY OPENS THE BIGGEST LNG PLANT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS THING APPROVED FOR YEARS. I GOT THOSE PERMITS SO FAST FOR THEM. THESE BIG ENERGY EXECUTIVES WERE SITTING BACK AND THEY COULD NOT GET IT APPROVED. NOTHING THEY COULD DO. YOUR GOVERNOR WAS LOUSY. NO ONE COULD HELP. THAT THING WAS SO DEAD. I CAME ALONG AND GOT IT APPROVED. CONSULTANTS CALLED UP THESE BIG ENERGY EXECUTIVES. WE WERE ABLE TO GET IT APPROVED. I NEVER SAW THESE PEOPLE. I KNOW IT WAS A GOOD THING. THEY PROBABLY GOT MILLIONS IN CONSULTING FEES. I WOULD RATHER GIVE IT TO YOU PEOPLE. OR CHARITY. BUT IT CAME ALONG. NOBODY KNOWS CONSULTANTS BETTER THAN ME. THEY MAKE THE ENVIRONMENTAL RULES TOUGH. YOU HAVE TO PAY THEM A LOT OF MONEY TO SKIRT YOUR WAY THROUGH. IT TAKES YEARS AND YEARS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS. I GOT THAT PLANT APPROVED AND I CAME DOWN TWO MONTHS AGO. I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO BIG. NOW THEY GOING TO DOUBLE IT UP. THEY WILL PROTECT YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. OUR TWO GUYS. EDWARDS WON'T. WHEN IT GETS CLOSE AND THEY START CALLING FROM WASHINGTON AND SCHUMER AND PELOSI CALL, WE WANT TO TO GET RID OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT, HE IS 100% GOING TO DROP THE SECOND AMENDMENT. YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE. JOHN BEL EDWARDS WILL NOT PROTECT YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. OUR GUYS SUPPORT YOUR POLICE. THEY DEFEND THE GREAT WORKERS AND FAMILIES OF THE STATE. IF YOU WANT TO GOVERNOR WHO WILL FIGHT FOR YOUR VALUES, GET OUT TOMORROW AND CAST YOUR BALLOT. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. , FEAR , COME UP HERE. HERE IS THE PROBLEM. WE ARE ON LIVE TELEVISION ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY DON'T LIKE THIS. THEY SAY PUT TRUMP BACK ON. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HIT YOUR REPUBLICAN OPPONENT. YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO HIT JOHN BEL EDWARDS BECAUSE HE DESERVES IT. GO AHEAD. IS THIS INCREDIBLE? WE NEED SOMEONE TO DO FOR LOUISIANA WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE FOR THE USA. WE NEED A CONSERVATIVE. A BUSINESSMAN. SOMEONE WHO IS NOT BEHOLDEN TO SPECIAL INTERESTS. SOMEONE WHO WILL FIGHT FOR LOUISIANA. THAT IS WHY I AM IN THIS RACE. LET'S GO GET IT. LET'S FIRE JOHN BEL EDWARDS. LET'S THANK OUR PRESIDENT FOR COMING DOWN HERE TO HELP US. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT FOR COMING TO LOUISIANA AND MAKING LOUISIANA GREAT AGAIN. MR. PRESIDENT, WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS. FOR REBUILDING OUR MILITARY. AND FOR PROTECTING OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. I DROPPED A RESOLUTION TO EXPEL NANCY PELOSI FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. GO AMERICA GO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU HAVE TO DO IT TOMORROW. GET A RUNOFF. VOTE TOMORROW FOR THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN TICKET. WE ARE ALSO DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED BY TWO REALLY GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE. THESE ARE WARRIORS. DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE BUT EQUALLY THEY FIGHT FOR YOU AND THEY LOVE THE STATE AND THEY LOVE THIS COUNTRY. ONE HAS A STRANGE NAME. HE CALLED ME UP. THEY SAID THERE IS A MAN NAMED JOHMNN KENNEDY ON THE PHONE. HE IS RUNNING FOR THE SENATE IN A STATE THAT LIKES YOU A LOT. I SAID WHERE? LOUISIANA. I SAID LET ME CHECK IT OUT. IT IS TRUE. VERY SUCCESSFUL GUY. BRILLIANT GUY. I AM A BIG STUDENT. I LIKE ACADEMICS. MY UNCLE WAS A PROFESSOR FOR 35 YEARS AT M.I.T. HE WENT TO OXFORD. THAT IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS. HE WAS A GREAT STUDENT AT OXFORD. HE PUTS ON THAT COUNTRY STUFF ALL THE TIME. WE KNOW THE COUNTRY IS SMARTER THAN THE OTHER GUY ANYWAY. JOHN KENNEDY SAYS, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT. I SAID, TO ME YOU ARE THE REAL CHINA KENNEDY, YOU ARE THE REAL DEAL. IT WAS A FRIDAY NIGHT AND THERE WAS THIS MASSIVE AIRPLANE HANGAR SOMEPLACE. IT WAS SOMEWHERE IN YOUR GREAT STATE. WE HAD THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SHOW UP. I LOOKED AT HIM AND I LIKED HIM AND I LOOKED AT THAT CROWD AND SAID, I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO WIN TOMORROW. THE ELECTION WAS ON A SATURDAY. JOHN KENNEDY WON BY A LOT. IT WAS A GREAT THING FOR OUR COUNTRY. WHERE IS JOHN KENNEDY? COME HERE. WE HAVE ANOTHER GUY. ANYTIME I TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE , ANYTIME I WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MEDICAL, TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE, I CALL A MAN NAMED BILL CASSIDY. HE IS INCREDIBLE. WHAT A HEART. , ON A PEER, JOHN. , COME ON UP HERE, JOHN. OXFORD! EARLIER I GAVE HIM A QUIZ. I IMAGINED YOU WERE RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN. AND I ASKED HIM, WHO IS MORE LIKELY TO SECURE THE SOUTHERN BORDER? BUT THERE WAS ONE QUESTION I FORGOT TO ASK. WHO PROMISED TO BUILD A NEW RIVER BRIDGE? TWO GREAT MEN. TWO GREAT AMERICANS. ANOTHER MAN WHO IS VERY BRAVE. HE WAS IN BAD CONDITION. I WAS AT THE HOSPITAL THE NIGHT HE WAS EXPECTED TO DIE. HE WAS NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD THAT NIGHT. I WENT THERE AND THE DOCTOR SAID, IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SAVE HIM. I THINK HE IS BETTER LOOKING NOW THAN HE WAS TWO YEARS AGO. THE GREATEST THING, HE WAS PLAYING BASEBALL. HE WAS SHOT WHILE THEY WERE PRACTICING. STEVE SCALISE. HE IS RECOVERING. I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO IT. HE HAD A LOT OF DAMAGE. HE WENT OUT AND HE PLAYED IN THE BASEBALL GAME SIX MONTHS LATER. THE FIRST BATTER HITS A GROUNDBALL RIGHT AT HIM. I SAID THIS IS GOING TO BE TERRIBLE. HE GOT DOWN AND HE GOT THAT PAUL AND HE CAUGHT IT. AND HE THREW TO FIRST. HE COULD BARELY THROW. HE THREW IT TO FIRST ON THE BATTER WAS OUT. THAT WAS A MIRACLE. THE FIRST PITCH OF THE GAME. HOW TOUGH IS THAT? I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STOP THAT SUCKER. HE IS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE AND HE IS ANOTHER ONE. HE LOVES YOU SO MUCH. HE IS REALLY A BRAVE GUY. STEVE SCALISE. AND THEN WE HAVE SOME OTHER GREAT WARRIORS, GREAT CONGRESSMEN. COME ON UP, FELLAS. THANK YOU. THEY ARE WARRIORS. THEY MAKE BETTER , OUR LIVES BETTER ON WASHINGTON. YOU HAVE AN AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER WELL KNOWN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AN INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. THANK YOU.

YOU HAVE NOT HEARD THAT IN A LONG TIME. 7 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF OF FOOD STAMPS SINCE OUR GREAT ELECTION. UNEMPLOYMENT JUST REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE IN OVER 50 YEARS. UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANIC AMERICANS, AND ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE HIT THE ALL-TIME LOWEST RATES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WAGES ARE RISING FAST. FEWER CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY TODAY WHEN I WAS SELECTED. I HAVE CUT A RECORD NUMBER OF JOB KILLING REGULATIONS. OVER $1 TRILLION HAS BEEN BROUGHT BACK IN AND IS BEING SPENT BUILDING IN THE UNITED STATES INSTEAD OF BUILDING OVERSEAS. THE DEMOCRATS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAVE PLEDGED TO ABOLISH ALL AMERICAN PRODUCTION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THAT IS WONDERFUL. DEMOCRATS ARE PROMISING TO ANNIHILATE LOUISIANA'S ECONOMY. WE ARE NEVER GOING TO LET THEM DO THAT. ONE OF YOUR SENATORS JUST SET IT. I CAME HERE TO GET YOU TO GO OUT TO VOTE. ONE OF YOUR SENATORS TOLD ME, YOU NEVER HAVE TO GO BACK TO LOUISIANA. GO TO THOSE STATES THAT ARE CLOSE. MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA. WE ABSOLUTELY WON THOSE STATES BY SO MUCH NOBODY EVER SAW IT COMING. I DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION. IT WAS THE SAME KIND OF AN ARENA. IT WAS PACKED. THAT WAS NORTH CAROLINA. WE WON PENNSYLVANIA LAST TIME. THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS. WE WON MICHIGAN. WE WON SOUTH CAROLINA. FLORIDA. AND WISCONSIN. WE HAVE TO GET NANCY TO APPROVE THE USMCA. WE CALL THEM THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS. WE WILL DO IT AFTER WE TAKE OVER THE HOUSE. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION BETRAYED OUR NATION ENERGY WORKERS. NOW WE ARE PROUDLY PROMOTING AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. WE ARE INDEPENDENT. I APPROVED THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE AND THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE. 48,000 JOBS. MY FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE. I SIGNED EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO SPEED UP THE CONSTRUCTION OF CRITICAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND I OPENED UP AND WARM , ANWAR, THE LARGEST DRILLING SITE ANYWHERE. IT IS IN ALASKA. THEY COULD NOT GET IT DONE. EVEN RONALD REAGAN COULD NOT GET IT DONE. WE GOT IT DONE. WE ENDED DECADES OF RUINOUS TRADE POLICIES THAT RANSACKED THE COMMUNITIES OF THE STATE. LOUISIANA LOST ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS AFTER THE TWIN DISASTERS OF NAFTA AND CHINA'S ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION. PROBABLY THE WORST TRADE DEAL EVER MADE. WE ARE REPLACING NAFTA WITH THE BRAND-NEW U.S.-MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT. IT WILL BE A MASSIVE VICTORY FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND GROWERS AND WORKERS. THEY MAY SAY WE CANNOT DO ANYMORE. WE DON'T WANT ANYMORE. THEY WILL BE CALLING ME FROM NEBRASKA. FROM IOWA. WE ARE WINNING SO MUCH. PLEASE, MR. PRESIDENT. WE DON'T WANT TO WIN SO MUCH. WE ARE NOT USED TO IT. THEY WILL BE CALLING ME FROM NEBRASKA. FROM IOWA. IF THERE WAS HONEST VOTING, I DO THINK I WOULD'VE ONE THAT AS WELL. BUT THERE IS NOT. WHATEVER THEY TELL YOU, THERE IS NOT. THEY WILL BE SAYING WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE. IT IS NOT A NICE FEELING? DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK AND PASS THE USMCA. WE HAVE TAKEN THE TOUGHEST ACTION EVER TO CONFRONT CHINA'S DECADES OF ABUSE AND NOW WE ARE GETTING ALONG WITH CHINA. THIS WAS A GREAT DAY I WAS ALMOST LATE FOR YOU BECAUSE I WAS WITH CHINA. I SAID I AM NOT GOING TO BE LATE FOR LOUISIANA EVEN IF IT MEANS STANDING UP CHINA. IT WAS BETWEEN LOUISIANA AND CHINA. I HAD TO PICK LOUISIANA. TODAY I WAS WITH THE VICE PREMIER OF CHINA. ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MEN IN THE WORLD. WE MADE THAT SIGNIFICANT PROCESS , PROGRESS. THEY WANT IT BADLY. IT WILL END THE MISTREATMENT OF AMERICAN WORKERS AND COMPANIES IT WILL BE GREAT FOR CHINA TOO. WE WILL NOT REST UNTIL WE ACHIEVE ECONOMIC FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER AND AMERICAN PEOPLE. DEMOCRATS HAVE PUT THE NEEDS OF FOREIGN CITIZENS AHEAD OF OUR OWN. WE PROTECT BORDERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. WE DON'T PROTECT OUR OWN BORDERS. YOU SEE THE NUMBERS. THEY HAVE PLUMMETED. 27,000. THINK OF IT. JUST BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WOULD NOT APPROVE SIMPLE CHANGES MEXICO HAS HELPED US MORE ON OUR BORDER THAN THE DEMOCRATS. ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS THIS BULLISHNESS. PEOPLE SEE THEIR GAME. THE VOTERS ARE SMART. IN A RECENT DEBATE, EVERY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RAISE THEIR HAND IN FAVOR OF GIVING FREE GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS. YOU WONDER WHY THEY COME TO AMERICA. WHY WOULDN'T THEY COME? FREE EVERYTHING. I DID IT AGAIN. I WAS JUST KIDDING. THE DEMOCRATIC VISION FOR AMERICA IS TO ROB AMERICAN TAXPAYERS TO FUND SOCIALISM FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD. IF YOU DON'T WANT DEMOCRATS TO RAID YOUR HEALTH CARE, STEAL YOUR MONEY, OVERCROWD YOUR SCHOOLS, AND OVERWHELM YOUR COMMUNITIES, THEN YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE. YOU HAVE TO GO OUT TOMORROW AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. GET JOHN BEL EDWARDS THE HELL OUT OF OFFICE. I NEVER FORGET THAT I AM NOT PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD. I AM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE REJECT GLOBALISM. WE EMBRACE PATRIOTISM. WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN DESERVES A GOVERNMENT THAT IS LOYAL TO THEM. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND THE EXTREME RADICAL LEFT ARE TRYING TO ABOLISH THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CITIZENS AND NONCITIZENS. IN MANY CASES, PEOPLE WHO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY WERE TREATED BETTER THAN OUR VETS. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF GREAT VETS. PEOPLE WHO WERE COMING IN ILLEGALLY WERE TREATED BETTER THAN THEM. NOT ANYMORE. JUST RECENTLY, NEW YORK CITY, I LOVE NEW YORK CITY, WE HAVE SOME REAL BAD LEADERSHIP OVER THERE. THE MAYOR RAN FOR PRESIDENT. HE GOT ZERO. HOW DO YOU GET ZERO? IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. THERE HAS TO BE ONE STRANGE PERSON OUT THERE. HE GOT ZERO. NEW YORK WANTED HIM TO DO SO WELL. THEY DID NOT WANT HIM BACK AS MAYOR. THEY WOULD HAVE SAID LET HIM BE PRESIDENT, JUST KEEP THEM THE HELL AWAY FROM NEW YORK. HE ISSUED A RULE THAT THE USE OF THE TERM ILLEGAL ALIEN CAN NOW BE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF UP TO $250,000. CAN YOU IMAGINE? YOU ARE A HARD WORKER AND YOU'RE SAVING YOUR MONEY. YOU JUST BUILT UP THAT MONEY AFTER YEARS OF CONSTRUCTION WORK. YOU ARE RICH. YOU FEEL BETTER THAN TRUMP EVER DID. YOU HAPPEN TO, AND ONE OF THOSE BAD MOMENTS, USE THE WORD ILLEGAL ALIEN. THEY SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GIVE ME THAT MONEY YOU WORKED YOUR ASS OFF FOR. THEIR ATTACK ON FREE SPEECH GOES HAND-IN-HAND WITH THEIR ATTACK ON AMERICA'S BORDERS. THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS ARE SOFT ON AMERICAN FREEDOM AND AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP. DEMOCRATS ALSO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE FOREIGN INTERVENTION IN OUR ELECTIONS BY REFUSING TO SUPPORT A SIMPLE AND BEAUTIFUL THING CALLED VOTER ID. MAYBE I CAN ASK OUR SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN. IT IS SO POPULAR. IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND BUY GROCERIES, YOU NEED IDENTIFICATION. ALMOST ANYTHING. THE ONLY THING YOU DON'T NEED IDENTIFICATION FOR IS TO VOTE. THEY CHEAT LIKE HELL. THAT IS WHY. MAYBE THEY COULD PUT OUT A VOTER ID. YOU GUYS BELIEVE IN THAT, DON'T YOU? THEY COULD PUT IT OUT. THAT IS WHY I LOVE THIS STATE. NOW I KNOW WHY I WON THE STATE. PEOPLE CANNOT CHEAT. I LOVE THIS STATE. IT IS SO GREAT. DON'T CHANGE. PUT IT OUT FOR EVERY OTHER STATE. MOST STATES DON'T HAVE IT. WE BELIEVE AMERICANS SHOULD VOTE IN ELECTIONS. YOU GO OUT TO CALIFORNIA AND YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING OUT THERE, IT IS A DISGRACE. DEMOCRATS ACCEPT SANCTUARY CITIES. THEY RELEASE VIOLENT CRIMINAL ALIENS ONTO YOUR STREETS. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR CITIES SHOULD BE SANCTUARIES FOR LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS. LAST NIGHT'S THEY HAD TRUMP LOVES COPS. AND COPS LOVE TRUMP. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN SO FAR OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM. THEY HAVE GONE CRAZY. THEY ARE PEOPLE. THEY ARE CRAZED LUNATICS. EVERY DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS PUSHED A HEALTH CARE AGENDA THAT WOULD AND MEDICARE AS WE KNOW IT. WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT MEDICARE FOR OUR BELOVED SENIORS. AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE WILL PROTECT YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE. WHO HAS PRIVATE INSURANCE? HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF THE TICKET AWAY? , TOOK IT AWAY? WE HAVE TAKEN SWIFT ACTION TO LOWER THE PRICE OF HEALTH CARE FOR WORKING FAMILIES. WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. THE MOST UNPOPULAR, UNFAIR THING . THAT IS WHEN YOU PAY A FORTUNE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF NOT HAVING TO PAY A FORTUNE. YOU ARE PAYING TO NOT HAVE TO PAY. IT IS TERRIBLE. I GOT RID OF IT. IT IS A BIG DEAL. THAT WAS NOT EASY. OUR AMBITIOUS CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAS PRODUCED THE LARGEST DECLINE IN DRUG PRICES AND MORE THAN 50 YEARS. WE ARE BRINGING THEM DOWN MUCH LOWER. WE ARE GOING TO GIVE OUR STATES, THE DRUG INDUSTRY HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL WIRED. DRUGS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. IN OTHER COUNTRIES, YOU CAN BUY THE EXACT SAME DRUG FOR 70% LESS. SAME DRUG, SAME FACTORY, SAME COMPANY. I JUST GAVE THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA AND I'M GIVING OTHER GOVERNORS THE RIGHT TO GO TO CANADA AND OTHER COUNTRIES TO BUY THE DRUGS. THEY PAY MUCH LESS. WE ARE GIVING STATES THE RIGHTS TO GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND MAKE A DEAL ON DRUGS. IT IS EASIER THAN GOING THROUGH THIS HORRIBLE SYSTEM WHERE THE DEMOCRATS REFUSED TO ALLOW YOU TO DO ANYTHING TO CUT THE PRICE OF DRUGS. THEY DON'T WANT TO LET YOU DO IT. TO HELP PATIENTS WITH LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS, WE PASSED RIGHTS TO TRY. IF YOU ARE TERMINALLY ILL, VERY SICK, WE HAVE THE BEST DOCTORS AND LABS AND TECHNICIANS IN THE WORLD. THEY HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. YOU COULD NOT GET IT. YOU ARE TERMINALLY ILL. YOU'RE GOING TO BE AROUND FOR FOUR WEEKS. WE CAN'T GIVE YOU THIS DRUG. IT MAY HURT YOU. FOR 50 YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET IT. I DID IT PRETTY QUICKLY. I SAID WE WILL DO THESE DISCLOSURES THAT SAY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SUE THE GOVERNMENT OR THE DRUG COMPANY. BUT PEOPLE SAY, IT IS A MIRACLE. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAVED. IT IS INCREDIBLE. THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT SIX YEARS. THEY WILL BE GONE. EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT ALSO NOW SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABIES STRAIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THAT IS WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTION, SOCIALISM, AND BLATANT CORRUPTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, FAMILY, DREAM. THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT. REPUBLICANS WANT THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE HAVE CONFIRMED 100 , PEOPLE DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THIS, RECORD STUFF, OBAMA GAVE ME 142 FEDERAL JUDGES. I FIGURED IT WAS NONE. I SAID, YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING. WITHIN TWO MONTHS WE WILL HAVE ABOUT 100. OUR HISTORIC INVESTMENT AND REBUILDING THE MILITARY HAS INCLUDED $25 MILLION FOR A PLACE CALLED BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE. EVER HEAR OF IT? RIGHT HERE IN LOUISIANA. $40 MILLION TO NAVAL AIR STATION JOINT RESERVE BASE NEW ORLEANS. OUR WARRIORS HAVE MORE AMMUNITION, MISSILES, ROCKETS, TANKS, FIGHTER JETS, EVERYTHING OUR TROOPS NEED TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY THAN WE HAVE EVER HAD BEFORE. IT IS ALL MADE IN THE USA. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE PUTTING A STOP TO THE ENDLESS WARS. WE HAVE TO BRING OUR FOLKS BACK HOME. WARS GOING ON FOR 19 YEARS. WE ARE POLICE AGENTS. WE ARE NOT FIGHTING WARS. WE CAN'T DO IT. NOT FAIR. OTHER COUNTRIES SHOULD HELP US. THEY DON'T TREAT US RIGHT BUT THEY ARE STARTING TO. ONE OF THE MIDDLE EAST , GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS ONE OF THE BEST , WORST DECISIONS EVER MADE. IT IS LIKE QUICKSAND. WE SPENT A TRILLION DOLLARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BUT THEN WE WANT TO FIX UP A BRIDGE AND THEY SAY, SIR, THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY. WE ARE SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY BRINGING OUR GREAT SOLDIERS AND WARRIORS BACK HOME. AFTER DECADES OF REBUILDING FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WE ARE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR OWN COUNTRY. FOR YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOUR POLITICIANS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. NOT SO LONG AGO. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA. THE PATH TO VICTORY BEGINS WITH A GIANT WIN TOMORROW HERE IN THE GREAT STATE OF LOUISIANA. WITH YOUR SUPPORT, WE WILL SHOW THE CORRUPT DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT BACKING DOWN. WE WILL NEVER, EVER FORGET. WE WILL SEND A TERRIFIC NEW REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR TO BATON ROUGE. TOMORROW, BEFORE THE GAME, GET YOUR FRIENDS, FAMILY, NEIGHBORS, GET OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. THESE ARE TWO GREAT PEOPLE. GET OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF OUR GREAT CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK. FROM DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE. FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. TOGETHER, WE WILL ELECT MORE REPUBLICANS TO CONGRESS TO CREATE AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS AMERICAN JOBS, WAGES, FAMILIES. WE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL MEXICO AND THEIR GREAT 27,000 SOLDIERS WHO ARE DOING THIS AS A FAVOR TO YOUR PRESIDENT, WE ARE NOT PAYING FOR IT, WE WILL TELL THEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOUR SERVICES ARE NO LONGER NEEDED. WE WILL ENACT TRADE DEALS THAT RESULT IN MORE PRODUCTS PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THE FOUR BEAUTIFUL WORDS, MADE IN AMERICA. WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE. FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCERS. AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA. YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS WILL BE DONE. IT WILL BE ENDED IN 10 YEARS. WE HAVE THE MEDICINES TO DO IT. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? IT COULD HAVE BEEN STARTED A LONG TIME AGO AND THEY DID NOT DO IT BUT I AM DOING IT. 10 YEARS, THE AIDS EPIDEMIC WILL BE ENDED. WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT WE COULD DO THAT? WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, FREE ASSEMBLY, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. AND ABOVE ALL, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICA. WE SUPPORT, PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. WE STAND WITH THE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY ARE GREAT. I HOPE THEY KNOW HOW MUCH WE CHERISH THEM, AND I THINK THEY DO. WE SAW IT LAST NIGHT IN MINNESOTA. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK IN THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY, NOT GOVERNMENT, BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND TO ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. AND HERE IN LOUISIANA AND ALL ACROSS THIS LAND, WE LIVE BY THE WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO, AND GOD WE TRUST. THAT WILL NEVER BE TAKEN AWAY. WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO CROSSED THE OCEANS, SETTLED A CONTINENT, TAMED THE WILDERNESS, REVOLUTIONIZED INDUSTRY, PIONEERED SCIENCE, WON TWO WORLD WARS, DEFEATED FASCISM AND COMMUNISM, AND WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT SOCIALISM AND PUT A MAN ON THE FACE OF THE MOON. PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY, AND TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WITH YOUR HELP, DEVOTION AND DRIVE, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON FIGHTING, AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. WE ARE ONE MOVEMENT, ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY AND ONE GLORIOUS NATURE AND , GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD. AMERICA IS THRIVING LIKE NEVER BEFORE, AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF LOUISIANA, THE BEST IS YET TO COME. GET OUT AND VOTE TOMORROW. TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU, LOUISIANA. GET OUT AND VOTE TOMORROW. THANK YOU.",

         "THANK YOU VERY MUCH, I APPRECIATE IT. AND, HELLO ROCHESTER, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, FOUR DAYS FROM NOW WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. AND, I DID NOT FORGET YOU, BECAUSE WE WERE GIVEN A HARD TIME BY YOUR SO-CALLED LEADERS, BUT THEY ARE NOT VERY GOOD LEADERS AS YOU FOUND OUT. DURING THE RIOTS, AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOUR MORE YEARS IN OUR GREAT, WHITE HOUSE. THANK YOU. AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE AT LEAST 25,000 PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BE HERE TONIGHT. WE JUST SAW A LOT OF THEM. WE WANTED TO PAY OUR RESPECTS. THEY WERE HERE FOR A LONG TIME, THEY WAITED, AND IN THE GOVERNOR DID BAD THINGS. YOUR FAR-LEFT DEMOCRAT ATTORNEY GENERAL, KEITH ELLISON, AND YOUR DEMOCRAT DOVE , GOVERNOR TRIED TO SHUT DOWN OUR RALLY, SILENCE THE PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, AND TAKE AWAY YOUR FREEDOM, AND YOUR RIGHTS. , THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD CANCEL, A WORD THEY ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH, CANCEL CULTURE. I SAID NO, I WOULD NEVER ABANDON THE PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA. I WILL NOT. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER THERE WITH CARS, WE FLEW OVER CARS, THEY GO MILES LONG. WHAT A SHAME. THEY WAITED HERE FOR A LONG TIME. I WANTED TO THANK THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE THAT WERE BARRED FROM ENTRY BY RADICAL DEMOCRATS, YOU ARE AMERICAN PATRIOTS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHEN LARGE NUMBERS OF RIOTERS AND VANDALS SACKED THE CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS EARLIER THIS YEAR, KEITH ELLISON DID NOT ASK THEM TO SUBMIT A PERMIT, HE TOLD THE THRONGS OF VIOLENCE DEMONSTRATORS, BY ALL MEANS, EXERCISE YOUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. HE SAID THAT. PRIOR TO THEM RIPPING DOWN YOUR CITY. KEITH ELLISON SIDED WITH FLAGBURNING EXTREMISTS OVER LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS. HE TREATS YOU LIKE SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. HE BELIEVES THAT THE PRO-AMERICAN VOTERS HAVE FEWER RIGHTS THAN ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATORS. KEITH ELLISON AND JOE BIDEN WANTS TO IMPRISON YOU IN YOUR HOMES WHILE LETTING ANARCHISTS, AGITATORS, AND VANDALS ROAM FREE AS THEY DESTROY YOUR CITIES AND STATES. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY ONCE YOU TO BE BANNED FROM PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY WHILE THEY ALLOW THEIR SUPPORTERS TO BURN DOWN A POLICE RIGHT HERE. BY THEN AND THE FAR-LEFT INCITE VIOLENCE WITH THEY ARE ANTI-POLICE RHETORIC , THEY ARE VILE ANTI-POLICE RHETORIC. THEY ALLOW RIOTERS TO LAY WASTE TO THE PUBLIC STREETS THAT THEY WERE FINANCED , AND THEY WERE FINANCED BY YOU WITH YOUR HARD-EARNED TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THE RADICAL LEFT IS DETERMINED TO OBLITERATE THE MIDDLE-CLASS. THEY THINK THEY CAN INDOCTRINATE YOUR CHILDREN AND SILENCE YOUR VOICES. BUT ON NOVEMBER 3, I HOPE YOU ARE LISTENING MINNESOTA, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE HAD TO PUT UP WITH FOR A LONG TIME. THE PEOPLE OF OUR NATION ARE GOING TO BE HEARD LIKE NEVER BEFORE. IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN. PEOPLE ARE ALREADY STARTING TO FIND OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO SHOW UP AND VOTE IN RECORD NUMBERS. YOU HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. AND THEY ARE GETTING VERY CONCERNED. THEY BAN YOU FROM GOING TO CHURCH WHILE THEY LET LEFT-WING EXTREMISTS BURNED DOWN THE CHURCH , BURNED DOWN THE CHURCH. WHILE THEIR OWN JOBS REMAIN TOTALLY EXEMPT. THEY KEEP YOUR KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL WHILE THEIR FAMILIES HIRE PRIVATE TUTORS. THEY FLOOD YOUR STREETS WITH ILLEGAL DRUGS AND GANGS WHILE THEY LIVE IN WALLED OFF COMPOUNDS. THEY WANT TO DESTROY AND WORK HARD TO DESTROY THE SUBURBS, WHICH I'M PROTECTING. AND TERMINATING HORRIBLE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT ONLY PERTAIN TO THE SUBURBS, WHILE THEY MOVE INTO GATED COMMUNITIES WITH ARMED GUARDS. THESE WEALTHY LIBERAL HYPOCRITES WANT TO DEFUND THE POLICE AND TAKE YOUR GUNS. WHILE THEY ARE PROTECTED BY ARMED GUARDS. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO DEFEND YOUR DIGNITY. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO DEFEND YOUR FAMILY AND COUNTRY. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO PRESERVE, PROTECT, AND DEFEND THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE. YOU MUST SHOW UP AND VOTE ON NOVEMBER 3. IN A SECOND TERM WE WILL INCREASE FUNDING FOR LAW FOR SPENT, WE WILL HIRE MORE , FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT,. WE WILL FINISH AND WIN THE WAR AGAINST MS 13 KILLERS. WE HAVE TAKEN THOUSANDS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. WE WILL PUT THEM ALL OUT OF BUSINESS. WE WILL COMPLETELY DISMANTLE ANTIFA. AND WE WILL RECLAIM OUR STREETS FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS OF EVERY RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, AND CREED. THESE ARE STREETS THAT HAVE BEEN RUN BY DEMOCRATS, NOT REPUBLICANS. IT HAS TAKEN TOO LONG OR THEM TO GAIN CONTROL OF THOSE STREETS. WE WILL DO ALL OF THIS AND SO MUCH MORE. ONLY WITH YOUR VOTE. YOU HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT VOTE. THIS STATE IN PARTICULAR. 1972. THIS IS A STATE, YOU HAVE BEEN POORLY RUN FOR TOO LONG. YOU WANT LAW AND ORDER ALSO. ON NOVEMBER 3, JOE , VOTE TO DEFEAT JOE BIDEN AND SAVE YOUR GREAT AMERICAN DREAM AND SAVE YOUR WONDERFUL AMERICAN FREEDOM. BIDEN IS A GRIMY, SLEAZY, AND CORRUPT CAREER POLITICIAN. WE FOUND THAT OUT. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN IT FOR A LONG TIME. WHO HAS DONE NOTHING BUT BETRAY YOU. ALL HE HAS DONE IS SELL OUT TO LOBBYISTS, SELL OUT TO LOBBYISTS, SELLOUT TO CHINA , CHINA OWNS HIM. SELL OUT TO BIG PHARMA, AND SELLOUT TO FOREIGN COMPANIES. HE WILL LICK YOU IN THE EYE AND TURN RIGHT AROUND , LOOK YOU IN THE EYE AND TURN AROUND AND STAB YOU. THE ONLY THING HE CARES ABOUT IS POLITICAL POWER AND HE WILL USE THAT POWER TO HURT YOU AND ENRICH HIS CRONIES AND FRIENDS. AND MOST OF ALL TO ENRICH HIS FAMILY. IT VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN IS ABOUT TO PUT FAR LEFT RADICALS LIKE KEITH ELLISON AND E LINE OMAR , ILHAN OMAR AND AOC PLUS THREE. BETO O'ROURKE WANTS TO TAKE YOUR GUNS ARRAY , GUNS AWAY. THEN THEY WANT TO PACK THE COURTS. WANT TO PACK THOSE COURTS. THE SUPREME COURT. I WANT TO PUT RADICAL JUSTICES WHO WILL CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS, TERMINATE YOUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY , ERASE ALL OF YOUR BORDERS, AND STIFLE LIFE. IF YOU WANT STRONG BORDERS, STRONG FAMILIES, SAFE COMMUNITIES, AND A THRIVING ECONOMY, THEN I AM ASKING YOU TO GO OUT ON NOVEMBER 3 AND VOTE FOR YOUR ALL-TIME FAVORITE PRESIDENT. ONE OF , THANK YOU. ONE OF THE MOST CRUCIAL ISSUES FOR MINNESOTA AND THE SELECTION IS THE SUBJECT OF REFUGEES. THIS IS A VITAL MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY I ISSUED A DIRECTIVE SUSPENDING THE ENTRY OF REFUGEES FROM FOUR NATIONS COMPROMISED BY TERRORISM. TERRORISM LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE, INCLUDING FROM SYRIA, SOMALIA, AND YEMEN. WE ARE KEEPING RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. I SPOKE TO PRESIDENT , I SPOKE TO PRESIDENT MACRON OF FRANCE YESTERDAY AND PUT OUT MY WARMEST SYMPATHY FOR WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH OVER THE LAST FOUR DAYS WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS, THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW HAVE SEEN. BIDEN HAS PLEDGED A STAGGERING 700% INCREASE IN REFUGEES FROM THE MOST DANGEROUS AND VIOLENT TERRORIST HOTSPOTS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. HE IS ALSO ABOUT TO TERMINATE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY TRAVEL BANS, CHECK FONT VERY HARD TO GET, WHICH I ONE , WON IN THE SUPREME COURT. HE SAID BRING THEM IN. BIDEN'S DEADLY MIGRATION POLICIES WILL OVERWHELM IN SODA AND OVERWHELM TAXPAYERS AND OPEN THE FLOODGATES TO TERRORISTS, JIHADISTS, AND VIOLENT EXTREMISTS. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION THE SAFETY OF OUR FAMILIES WILL ALWAYS COME FIRST. AMERICA FIRST. OUR FAMILIES FIRST. WITH YOUR SUPPORT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING BACK YOUR JOBS, YOUR TAXES, REGULATIONS, SUPPORT OUR GREAT POLICE, SUPPORT OUR MILITARY, DEFEND OUR BORDERS, PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT , WHICH IS TOTALLY UNDER SIEGE, BUT DON'T WORRY, AS LONG AS I'M HERE NOTHING IS HAPPENING WITH IT. PROTECT RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND ENSURE MORE PRODUCTS ARE PROUDLY STAMPED WITH THE VERY WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL PHRASE 'MADE IN THE USA.' YESTERDAY IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT LAST QUARTER OUR ECONOMY GREW AT THE FASTEST RATE EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 33.1%. PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED. I WASN'T. THE BIGGEST INCREASE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, BY FAR. 1952, BUT IT WAS A RATE LESS THAN HALF. WE ARE CREATING AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE THE LIKES OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. WE ARE BUILDING THE BIGGEST, STRONGEST, AND MOST PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS HUMAN HISTORY. I AM FIGHTING FOR HIGHER WAGES, MORE JOBS, MORE OPPORTUNITY, AND WE WILL KEEP IT RIGHT THERE AND WE WILL BRING IT RIGHT HERE TO THE USA, WHERE IT LONGS. , BELONGS. JOE BIDEN HAS NEVER SUCCEEDED BEFORE. BARACK OBAMA SAID, IF YOU WANT TO SEE THINGS SCREWED UP, JUST ASK JOE BIDEN TO DO IT. JOE BIDEN WILL SHIP YOUR FACTORIES TO CHINA, IMPOSE A $4 TRILLION TAX HIKE, ELIMINATE PRIVATE HEALTH CARE, ABOLISH THE ENTIRE OIL INDUSTRY AND FRACKING, AND SEND YOUR STATE INTO A CRIPPLING DEPRESSION. BIDEN'S ANTI-ENERGY ANTI-WORKER POLICIES WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE FOR LATINO AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN WORKERS ALL ACROSS OUR LAND. BIDEN WILL ALSO CONTINUE HIS 47 YEARS OF CRUELLY BETRAYING AFRICAN-AMERICANS. HE CALLED THEM SUPERPREDATORS IN 1994, RIPPED APART THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND DID EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO WIPE OUT THE BLACK MIDDLE CLASS. AND THEY UNDERSTAND IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY. I THINK YOU WILL PROBABLY SEE THAT AT THE PHOTO BOOTH THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE HAS DONE BETTER THAN ANYBODY. SUPERPREDATORS, HE SAID NOW BIDEN WANTS TO WIPE OUT THE ENTIRE INS, HISPANIC AMERICANS, AND ALL-AMERICANS. HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE IS DOING. HE WANTS TO GIVE YOU THE LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, BY FAR. BIDEN'S PLAN TO DELAY THE VACCINE, POSTPONE THERAPIES, CRASH THE ECONOMY, AND SHUT DOWN OUR ENTIRE COMPANY. HUNTER BIDEN'S LOCKDOWN, COUNTLESS AMERICANS WILL DIE FROM SUICIDE, DRUG OVERDOSES, AND DEFERRED MEDICAL CARE AT A LEVEL LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THERE WILL BE NO SCHOOL, NO GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS, NO THANKSGIVINGS, NO CHRISTMAS, NO FOURTH OF JULY, EASTER, NO NOTHING. THERE WILL BE NO FUTURE FOR AMERICA'S YOUTH. WE WILL DELIVER A SAFE VACCINE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND JUST A MATTER OF WEEKS. IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE VERY, VERY SPECIAL. WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN ON THE PANDEMIC, WITH A WILL , WITH OR WITHOUT VACCINE. WE HAVE THE VACCINE, EVEN WITHOUT IT, WE ARE ROUNDING THE TURN. SENIORS WILL BE FIRST TO GET IT AND WHAT , AND IT WILL BE AVAILABLE FREE. IT WAS THE FAULT OF CHINA, WHO SHOULD HAVE KEPT IT THEN THEIR LIMITS. OUR VACCINE WILL ERADICATE THE VIRUS AND THE PANDEMIC. IT WILL AND. , IT WILL END. NORMAL LIFE, RECORD-SETTING EVERYTHING AND A NORMAL LIFE. NEXT YEAR WILL BE THE GREATEST ECONOMIC YEAR IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. HE WILL WIPE OUT THE CHINA PLAGUE ONCE AND FOR ALL. WE ARE JOINED TODAY BY CONGRESSMAN JIM HAGEDORN AND CONGRESSMAN TOM AMBER. THANK YOU, FILLERS , FELLOWS. AND CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE , SOMEBODY THAT IS REALLY OUTSTANDING, I THINK YOU TWO AGREE? MICHELLE FISCHBACH. GREAT JOB. I SAW YOU IN THE DEBATE, HE DID A FANTASTIC JOB , YOU DID A FANTASTIC JOB. THANK YOU, PAUL. STATE REPRESENTATIVE KURT DOUBT, THANK YOU. I LIKE YOUR HAT. AND GOP CHAIR JENNIFER CARNAHAN. DOING WELL? I THINK WE ARE GOING TO WIN. 1972. AND YOU HAVE BEEN TREATED VERY, VERY BADLY. IN ADDITION, MIKE LINDELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT JOB, GREAT JOB. PERFORMANCE , THIS IS A BIG 1 , MATT PURK, MINNESOTA VIKINGS SUPERSTAR, REALLY? LOOK AT HIM. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD PLAY TOMORROW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MATT. ANOTHER VITAL ISSUE IS THE MINNESOTA IRON RANGE. I BROUGHT IT BACK TO LIFE. IT WAS DEAD, IT WAS CLOSED, AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO USE IT. AS VICE PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN TRIED TO OBLITERATE THE IRONY RANGE. , IRON RANGE. THERE WAS BARELY A WHIMPER. I BROUGHT THE IRON RANGE GOING BACK TO LIFE. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO LIVE IN MINNESOTA. THEY SAID IT WAS SO UNFAIR. WHEN IT WAS CLOSED, AND MAY COME UP TO ME , I DON'T KNOW WHO HE WAS , HE WAS A STRONG, POWERFUL MAN AND HE WAS CRYING AND HE SAID, THEY HAVE TAKEN MY LIFE AWAY FROM ME. THAT WAS THE MOST CONVINCING OF ALL. WHEN I SAW HIM I SAID, THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. IT IS FULLY OPENED AND DOING PHENOMENALLY. IT HAS THE BEST IRON, THEY SAY, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. CONGRATULATIONS. CONGRATULATIONS. IT WAS MY HONOR. THAT AREA IS NOW THRIVING. IT WAS DESOLATE. NINE DEMOCRAT MAYORS HAVE ENDORSED ME, BECAUSE THEY KNOW BIDEN WILL SHUT DOWN THE IRON RANGE FOREVER. BY THE WAY, THEY WILL SHUT IT DOWN AS FAST AS I OPENED IT UP AND THEY WILL SHUT DOWN PERMANENTLY NEXT TIME. HE SAID WE MADE A MISTAKE, WE DIDN'T DO IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. THEY WILL SHUT IT DOWN PERMANENTLY. I HOPE YOU REMEMBER THAT. ESPECIALLY ON NOVEMBER 3. UNDER MY LEADERSHIP WE ACHIEVE THE MOST SECURE BORDER IN AMERICAN HISTORY. BIDEN'S PLAN TO ADMIT FOREIGN WORKERS WILL/INCOMES, SURGE UNEMPLOYMENT, AND DEVASTATE YOU MIDDLE-CLASS. ALL TO ENRICH HIS GLOBALIST DONORS. HE RAISES MONEY LIKE CRAZY BECAUSE HE IS MAKING DEALS. I COULD RAISE MUCH MORE THAN HIM, THAT I WILL NOT BE COMPROMISED. AND WE DON'T NEED THE MONEY. THAT'S HOW THEY RAISED ALL OF THAT MONEY, BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING DEALS WITH WALL STREET. AS PRESIDENT I WILL ONLY ADVANCE IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT PUT AMERICAN WORKERS AND FAMILIES FIRST. YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ARE MY ONLY SPECIAL INTEREST. THAT IS WHY I DID THIS. AND I HAD A VERY NICE LIFE BEFORE DOING THIS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU. I WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING FOR YOU HARDER THAN ANYONE HAS EVER DONE BEFORE. THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY WILL NEVER, EVER BE FORGOTTEN AGAIN. YOU KNOW THAT AND YOU SAW THAT. FOUR YEARS AGO WE HAD A VERY, VERY EXCITING TIME. THIS IS EVEN MORE EXCITING, AND FRANKLY THIS IS A MORE IMPORTANT ELECTION. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE SAYING THAT. A VOTE FOR ME AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS ABOUT FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM , IS A VOTE FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM. THAT IMPORTANT TIME HAS FINALLY ARRIVED. THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION. THIS IS A VERY BIG MOMENT FOR OUR COUNTRY. THIS TUESDAY OR SOONER, GET OUT AND VOTE. EVERYONE OF YOU. REMEMBER WHAT YOUR GOVERNOR DID THIS EVENING. AND IT IS A SMALL THING, BUT A HORRIBLE THING, TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE OUTSIDE THAT COULD BE HERE. WE COULD ALL BE TOGETHER. A HORRIBLE THING THEY DID. YOUR STATE AND COUNTRY DEPEND ON YOU. WE DEPEND ON YOUR BOAT. WE DEPEND ON YOUR LOYALTY, AND YOU HAVE MY LOYALTY , THAT YOU KNOW AND THAT YOU FOUND OUT. TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO MAKE HISTORY. ON NOVEMBER 3 WE ARE GOING TO MAKE HISTORY AND THIS WILL BE VERY SPECIAL FOR MINNESOTA. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR YEARS. EVEN WITH ME WE LOST BY HALF A POINT. ONE MORE STOP. I SHOULD HAVE COME ONE MORE TIME, JUST ONE MORE TIME. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NOT GOING TO MATTER BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN EVEN BIGGER VICTORY ON NOVEMBER 3. GOD BLESS YOU, GOD BLESS MINNESOTA, AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WE APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. NICE SEEING YOU, MATT. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.",

         "Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation. The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people. Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first. There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country. This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission, and the power of American pride. In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade , the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you. In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution , and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness. Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades. In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom , a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs , something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started. Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history , 157 million. We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty , and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try. My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations. We have unleashed a revolution in American energy , the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before. On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone , almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States , and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way! We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate , some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country. Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans. And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population , and far beyond. Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing , and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life. In June, I commuted Alice's sentence , and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. When I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing. Inspired by stories like Alice's, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption. We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home. As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis. The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border. Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business. As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught. This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well-being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration , reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate , it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery. Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities , including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families , no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured. Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter, Madison. To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border. In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings. We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: 'If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job.' Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year. Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement , and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE. My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall , but the proper wall never got built. I'll get it built. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier , not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime , one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe. As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before , and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before. As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount , reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods , and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us , I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs. Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried , until now. Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement , or USMCA , will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA. Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us. Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure. I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill , and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity. The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs , and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Already, as a result of my Administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years. But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it. I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down. No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America. Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer. Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: 'Last Day of Chemo.' Grace , you are an inspiration to us all. Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research. To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave , so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children , born and unborn , are made in the holy image of God. The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security. Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military , with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO , but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies. As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System. Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests. For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't , in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far. As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam. Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido. We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom , and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair. Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence , not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled realism , not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel , and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East. As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home. I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor , and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement , but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole , and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack. We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country. We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery , but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil. Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall , more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: 'It's the Americans.' A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. 'To me,' Joshua recalls, 'the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.' I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight , seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation. When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America , they did it for us. Everything that has come since , our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice , all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before. Think of this Capitol , think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire. Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences , or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance , or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown. This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future , our fate , and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's destiny , that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world! Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!",

         "Well, good morning. And thank you all for being here. I want to thank my wonderful wife, our Second Lady Karen Pence; the Surgeon General; Dr. Tony Fauci; and members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force who are joining us here today. I especially want to thank the fine medical team at Walter Reed Hospital that administered our vaccine today. I didn't feel a thing. Well done. And we appreciate your service to the country. You know, as the Christmas holiday approaches, this is always a season of hope. We gather here today, at the end of a historic week, to affirm to the American people that hope is on the way. And Karen and I were more than happy to step forward before this week was out to take the safe and effective coronavirus vaccine that we have secured and produced for the American people. It's a truly inspiring day. As the people of this country witnessed this past week, under Operation Warp Speed, the first coronavirus vaccine is literally being administered in states across the country to millions of Americans. And make no mistake about it: It's a medical miracle. The average vaccine, I'm told by our experts, usually takes between 8 and 12 years to develop and then manufacture and distribute. But we're on track, here in the United States, to administer millions of doses to the American people in less than one year. It is a miracle indeed. And I also believe that history will record that this week was the beginning of the end of the coronavirus pandemic. But with cases rising across the country, with hospitalizations rising across the country, we have a ways to go. And I want to assure the American people that we're going to continue to make sure that our healthcare providers have all the support and resources they need to meet this moment. But vigilance and the vaccine is our way through. And building confidence in the vaccine is what brings us here this morning. Ever since I was asked by President Trump to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, I have been inspired by the diligence and energy of our researchers in this country. Early on, the President brought some of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world together in the Cabinet Room and said that we needed medicines, we needed therapeutics, and we needed vaccines, and we needed them in record time. I watched the historic pace with which the dedicated men and women at the FDA worked. But, today, Karen and I wanted to step forward and take this vaccine to assure the American people that while we cut red tape, we cut no corners. And thanks to Operation Warp Speed, thanks to incredible research companies, thanks to the great work at the National Institute of Health, and the great and careful work of the FDA, and the leadership of our President in Operation Warp Speed, the American people can be confident we have one and perhaps, within hours, two safe and effective coronavirus vaccines for you and for your family. And now we're in the process of distributing millions of doses of a safe and effective vaccine all across the country. Working closely with our nation's governors, we've already seen the vaccine delivered to healthcare workers and seniors across the nation. This week, 2.9 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been allocated. And next week, 2 million more doses will be distributed across America. And as you all know, yesterday, the FDA advisory panel recommended approval of the Moderna vaccine. And when it is approved, we expect later today, we'll be in a position to ship 5.9 million doses of vaccines all across the country next week. In fact, under Operation Warp Speed, we are poised to have vaccine for 20 million Americans before the end of December. It is truly a medical miracle and an inspiration to people across this country. It is a , it's a tribute as well to the dedication of all of those working at the federal level and the state level who have implemented this project. From early on, President Trump gave the White House Coronavirus Task Force one mission, and that was to save lives. And in the midst of one of the most challenging years in the life of this nation, I truly do believe that, despite the heartbreak and hardship that we have endured as a nation, that we've done just that. Working with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force these last 10 months, we scaled testing. Now we're doing nearly 2 million tests a day and have performed more than 200 million coronavirus tests across America. And the FDA just approved the first over-the-counter coronavirus test for at-home testing for the American people. Working with the great team at FEMA and with the Department of Defense, we identified and distributed literally billions of medical supplies to our doctors and nurses and hospitals, and we'll continue to ensure that all of our caregivers in this country have the resources and the support they need to continue to meet this moment. We saw to the development of therapeutics, remdesivir, monoclonal antibodies, the good use of steroids, and other methods that have literally saved lives across the country. And as we gather here today, and as we celebrate this week, we secured a safe and effective vaccine that's being distributed all across America. I would be remiss if I didn't take this moment, at the end of this challenging year, simply to say thanks to the men and women who served on the White House Coronavirus Task Force. You will hear from several of them in just a few moments. But let me give credit where credit is due. I want to thank Dr. Tony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx. I want to thank Dr. Robert Redfield and all the great men and women at the CDC. I want to thank Secretary Alex Azar of HHS and Seema Verma at the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. And I also want to thank the great team at FEMA that has stood up the greatest national mobilization since World War Two, and Pete Gaynor, and General Sanford, and all of those that have worked to make sure that the American people and our healthcare workers have the supplies they need has made an extraordinary difference in the life of the nation. I'm also grateful for the steady hand and leadership of Dr. Ben Carson, who has been with us every step of the way. I know I speak for every American when I say , and I speak for our President when I say: Thank you for your service in this year and in the days to come. The truth is, the American people deserve to know that we've never been more prepared to combat the coronavirus than we are today. And even while we see cases rising and hospitalizations rising and heartbreaking losses, we'll continue to marshal the resources that we have secured as a nation, including a safe and effective vaccine to meet this moment. But that being said, it's important that every American remember that all of us have a role to play. The way through this challenging time is vigilance and a vaccine. The day will come when we put the coronavirus in the past, but it will be a combination of all the efforts that I just described: a vaccine that is safe and effective for the American people but also the ongoing vigilance of every American. So as we , as we reach this extraordinary and historic moment in the life of our nation, let me urge every American to continue to do your part: Put the health of your family, your neighbors, and your community first; practice good hygiene; wash your hands; practice social distancing, or wear a mask whenever it's indicated, or whenever you're unable to practice distance; and listen to your local authorities. As President Trump often says, we are rounding the corner. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel. It is the light of American innovation and creativity. It is the light of lifesaving medicines and a safe and effective vaccine. After a year of heartbreak and hardship, the American people can be encouraged. And Karen and I hope this step today will be a source of confidence and of comfort to the American people that thanks to all the men and women who have operated under Operation Warp Speed, that we have a safe and effective vaccine and that these days of hardship and heartbreak will, in a day not too far in the distance, will be put in the past. So with gratitude for the American ingenuity of our research companies, with gratitude for the incredible healthcare workers who have met this moment and continue to meet this moment in the life of the nation, with gratitude for all the officials at the federal and state level, and gratitude to our President for his vision with Operation Warp Speed, I'm confident that we will get through this, we will get through this together, and we will heal our land. So thank you all very much. (Applause.)",

FOR ALL THE WORK YOU ARE DOING TO HELP FOLKS WHO NEED IT, IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU AND IT IS A SPECIAL HONOR TO BE CONDUCT , TO BE TOGETHER DURING AA PI. I AM ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE VICTORY FUND IT I WAS HONORED TO RECEIVE YOUR ENDORSEMENT IN JANUARY. THIS MADE A DIFFERENCE, WHICH NOW FEELS LIKE A LIFETIME AGO. THAT ABOUT OF COMPETENCE MEANT THE WORLD TO ME IN A CRITICAL MOMENT AND STILL DOES. AS I TOLD NUMBERS OF CONGRESS AN HOUR AGO, I WAS POLITICALLY RAISED IN THIS ARENA BY DANIEL INOUYE. HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON WHO ENCOURAGED ME TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I LEARNED AN AWFUL LOT FROM HIM. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR STANDING WITH ME LIKE DANNY DID. I HOPE YOUR FAMILIES ARE STAYING SAFE AND HEALTHY. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE ANXIOUS MOMENT FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES, OUR NATION AND THE WORLD. MY PRAYERS ARE WITH ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE SCARED, WHO ARE SICK, WHO O ARE GRIEVING AND JUST STRUGGLING TO GET BY. AS WE SPEAK TODAY, MORE THAN 90,000 AMERICANS HAVE NOW LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS PANDEMIC. SKILL , I DO NOT KNOW WHO'S PHONE THAT IS. THE SCALE OF THE LOSS IS STAGGERING. MORE THAN THAT, IT IS HEARTBREAKING SH. HOW MUCH FEAR, LOSS AND AGONY COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE PRESIDENT HAD NOT WASTED SO MUCH TIME IN TAKING RESPONSIBILITY. WE COULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING TEST. WE COULD HAVE MARSHALED SUPPLIES IN THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT, WHICH I CALLED FOR A LONG TIME AGO TO ENSURE EVERYONE COMMUNITY WAS READY. WE COULD HAVE BEEN EMBRACING THE PUBLIC TO ACT QUICKLY TO SLOW THE SPREAD. INSTEAD, WE GOT DENIAL, DELAYS, DISTRACTION. MANY OF WHICH WERE XENOPHOBIC. WE GOT PULLED FACED LIES ABOUT TESTING CAPACITY. THAT QUOTE, ANYBODY WHO A TEST CAN GET IT. IT WAS NOT REMOTELY TRUE TWO MONTHS AGO AND IS STILL NOT. WE GOT PROMISES. ONE DAY, , GOD ALMIGHTY. HE HAD MONTHS AND MONTHS TO TAKE ACTION. TO LEAD TO HE DID NOTHING BUT MAKE FALSE PROMISES AND DISMISS THE EXPERTS. NOW, 90,000 AMERICANS ARE GONE. LEAVING THE HIND , LEAVING BEHIND PROBABLY OVER 200,000, 300,000, 40,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST PART OF THEIR SOUL. MORE THAN 36 MILLION HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. MILLIONS MORE ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR BILLS. THIS PRESIDENT CANNOT SUMMON BARELY A WORD OF EMPATHY, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, EXPRESS REGRET. THERE IS NO INDICATION HE UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF THE PAIN AND THE LOSS THIS CRISIS HAS BROUGHT. IT IS NOT JUST LACK OF WORDS. IT IS LACK OF ACTION. CONGRESS GAVE THE ADMINISTRATION INTENSIFIED HIS OF DOLLARS FOR HELPING MAIN STREET IT WAS CALLED THE MAIN STREET LETTING PROGRAM TO HELP SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE NGRESS GAVE THAT MONEY CAN , THAT MONEY. THEY HAVE NOT LET A SINGLE DOLLAR YET. WHY DID THEY FAIL TO GET THIS MONEY OUT TO THE FOLKS WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT TO STAY AFLOAT? IS IT INCOMPETENCE? TRUMP IS TWEETING AGAIN THIS MORNING. REOPEN THE COUNTRY, END OF QUOTE. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT IF YOU ARE SITTING ON THE MONEY SMALL BUSINESSES NEED IN ORDER TO STAY ALIVE? STOP TWEETING ABOUT IT GET THE MONEY OUT TO MAIN STREET NOW. IT HAS BEEN PASSED. THIS PANDEMIC IS HITTING EVERYONE HARD. WE NEED SERIOUS COMPETENT LEADERSHIP NOW MORE THAN EVER. FRANKLY, WE NEED MORAL LEADERSHIP AS WELL. EVEN THOUGH THIS PANDEMIC HAS TOUCHED EVERY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD, AAPI COMMUNITY HAS HAD TO FIGHT ON AN ADDITIONAL FRONT. THE PANDEMIC HAS THE LEAST FAMILIAR FORCES OF HATE, FEAR AND XENOPHOBIA. WITH THIS PRESIDENT, IT BROUGHT , IT HAD BROUGHT WITH IT A NEW RASH OF RACIST MESSAGES, VERBAL, PHYSICAL ATTACKS AND OTHER ACTS OF HATE. SOME SUBTLE, SOME OVER, DIRECTLY AGAINST THE ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS SHOULD IT IS ONE OF , PACIFIC ISLANDERS. WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOLE OF THIS NATION. THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE WHAT HE IS DOING. IT STRIKES AT THE HEART OF OUR COUNTRY. WHO WE ARE, WHO WE WANT TO BE. THAT HATE IS ESPECIALLY DESPICABLE AT A TIME WHEN SO MANY ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE LEADING ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS FIGHT. LOOK AT THE THOUSANDS OF ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER NURSES, DOCTORS, RESEARCHERS, SCIENTISTS. DELIVERY DRIVERS, RETAIL WORKERS , RUNNING CRITICAL BUSINESSES, KEEPING US FED. THAT SERVICE IS NOT JUST ESSENTIAL. IT IS THE BEST OF AMERICA. IT IS THE BEST OF OUR STRENGTH, OUR COMPASSION, OUR SPIRIT. IT IS ALL BORN OF OUR UNIQUE DIVERSITIES AND PEOPLE. THE COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS. THE AAPI DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO NEVER MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO FAN THE FLAMES OF HATETE. YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO ATTACKS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE FOR VISITING A LOCAL CHINATOWN BUSINESS IN SAN FRANCISCO. YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO AGGRESSIVELY AND CHILDISHLY INSULTS ASIAN AMERICAN REPORTERS. THINK OF THAT. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE. INSULTS AND ASIAN AMERICAN REPORTER FOR DOING HER JOB AND ASKING A DIRECT QUESTION. YOU DESERVE A PARTNER AND A FRIEND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU DESERVE A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE HALLS. I WAS PROUD TO SERVE THE ADMINISTRATION THAT ALWAYS STOOD WITH THE AAPI COMMUNITY. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND IPHONE HARD TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY , OBAMA AND I FOUGHT HARD TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY. SECURE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR 2 MILLION ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE PROTECTED THOUSANDS OF AAPI DREAMERS GOING UP IN AMERICA. THE VERY PEOPLE NOW WHO ARE SAVING US, DOING THE JOBS AND RISKING LIVES. WE PROVIDED COMPENSATION FOR LONG OVERDUE , LONG OVERDUE COMPENSATION TO FILIPINO VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II. WE APPOINTED MAURYORE AAPI JUDGES TO THE BENCH THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION COMBINENED. WE ARE GOING TO STOP PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS TRACKS. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE TOGETHER AND ENSURE OUR GOVERNMENT ONCE AGAIN REFLECTS THE FULL DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY AND OUR COUNTRY AS A WHOLE INCLUDING MY CABINET. WE ARE TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE MADE TO DELIVER FOR THIS COMMUNITY ON HEALTH CARE, ON CLIMATE, ON BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT LEAVES NO ONE BEHIND. NOW, WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A TRAGEDY ON SO MANY LEVELS. THE PAIN WE ALL KNOW FROM FAIRLY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS IS SO STARK. SO CONSUMING. IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE ANYTHING BEYOND THAT PAIN. WE ARE GOING TO EMERGE FROM THIS MOMENT. WHEN WE DO, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE OF THE MOST BREATHTAKING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION. TO TAKE THIS. WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE DOCTORS, NURSES AND EMTS PUTTING THE LIVES ON THE LINE FOR US AND NY LOSING THEIR LIVES. A PUBLIC TRANSIT WORKER, GROCERY STORE CLERK CARRYING THE NATION ON THEIR B BACKS. ORDINARY AMERICANS SAYING, NO TO HATE, NO TO FEAR AND NO TO APATHY. REACHING OUT TO STRANGERS, CHECKING IN ON A FRIEND. WE CAN TAKE THAT SPIRIT. THE SOUL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND REBUILD THE COUNTRY IN ITS IMAGE. THIS MOMENT CAN BE AND MUST BE A STIRRING REMINDER OF WHO WE ARE, OF WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS REALLY ABOUT. I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THE WORLD AND TO PROVE TO OURSELVES WHAT AMERICA IS CAPABLE OF AT OUR BEST. TO FINALLY INVEST IN WORKERS. TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND BASED ON RACE, RELIGION, COLOR, ETHNICITY, DISABILITY. WE KNOW JUST HOW ESSENTIAL THEY TRULY ARE. TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY WHERE EVERYONE HAS A MYOPIC , AN OPPORTUNITY. MAKE SURE EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY IS TREATED WITH DEITY AND RESPECT. MY DAD USED TO SAY, EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT. WHETHER THERE IS A GUY SHINING THE SHOES OR THE PRESIDENT OF THE HOTEL CHAIN. WE HAVE A STRONG AND RESILIENT SAFETY NET WE HAVE TO RECONSTRUCT TO KEEP US GOING WHEN HARD TIMES HIT. I REVIEW RIGHT NOW MAY BE LIMITED BY THE BACKYARD IN THE BASEMENT AND THE SCENES OF OUR DEVICES, THAT I HOPE YOU WILL SEE WHAT I SEE. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SEPARATED PHYSICALLY, AND ENDURING DIFFICULT TIMES, I GIVE MY WORD I SEE A NATION GETTING READY TO COME TOGETHER. THE AAPI COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE BROKEN. OUR COMMUNITY AS A COUNTRY, OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY, WHICH IS A COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE BROKEN. NOT BY THIS PANDEMIC, NOT BY ANYTHING. NOT AS LONG AS WE STAND UNITED. WE ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS. WE CAN COME OUT ON THE OTHERS MUCH STRONGER, MUCH KINDER, MUCH CLOSER. JUST MORE RESILIENT THAN WE HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE. MCGREW, , REMEMBER, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAS TO GREAT CRISES AND AT THE END COME OUOUT STRONGER. WE NEED TO REMEMBER WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH IF WE WORK TOGETHER. COME THIS NOVEMBER, WITH YOUR HELP IN THE HELP OF THE ENTIRE ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY, WE ARE GOING TO PROVE IT. WE ARE GOING TO BE TOGETHER. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER. WE ARE GOING TO REMEMBER ALL THOSE WHO CARRIED US ON OUR , ON THEIR BACK THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. ORDINARY PEOPLE GETTING A CHANGE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF THIS MOVEMENT. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.",
