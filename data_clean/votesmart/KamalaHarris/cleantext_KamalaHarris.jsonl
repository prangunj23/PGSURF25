Harris delivered remarks in advance of President Trump's 2019 State of the Union address in which she rejected the president's attempts to drive Americans apart and instead offered a vision for the country based in speaking truth and recognizing that every American is united in service of a common, higher purpose. A full transcript of Senator Harris' remarks below, as prepared for delivery: Hi, everyone. Thanks for tuning in. So, listen , in war and peace, in times of hardship and prosperity, the State of the Union has always been a chance for our President to speak to the nation. It's a moment for a President to rise above politics and unite the country with a vision that includes ALL Americans, not just the ones who may have voted for them. It's a moment to bring us together and remind us that we should be united in service of a common purpose, a higher purpose. And I believe we are at an inflection point in the history of our nation. It's a moment where we must answer a fundamental question. Who are we? What is the state of our union? What is that higher purpose we're called to? And how must our leaders respond? We need our leaders to speak the truth that we have an economy where the cost of health care, housing, and education are going up, but paychecks aren't growing fast enough to keep up. We also need our leaders to speak truth about the threat of climate change and about our broken criminal justice system, about our weakened position in the world and about the realities of racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and transphobia. And we need our leaders to speak the biggest truth of all: In the face of powerful forces that have been trying to sow hate and division among us, the truth is that as Americans we have much more in common than what separates us. So let's speak those truths and recommit ourselves to fighting for our Union, an optimistic America. Let's fight for an America where the economy works for working people. An America where health care and education are fundamental rights, not a privilege for the wealthy few. Where our nation is secure, our democracy and its institutions are protected, and where we honor our service members and veterans. An America where no mother or father has to teach their son that people may stop him or kill him because of the color of his skin, and where no parent has to send their child to school with a bulletproof backpack. Let's fight for an America where we welcome refugees and immigrants, and where we fight for the dignity of all people, no matter who they are, no matter what they look like or how they identify. Now, if last year's remarks are any guide, we're in store not for a speech that will seek to draw us together as Americans, but one that seeks to score political points by driving us apart. We will hear insincere appeals to unity, but what we need is a policy agenda that calls on the better angels of our nature. So I want you all to listen closely. When you hear claims about how the economy is doing great, don't forget the working and middle-class families who are struggling, the teachers who are working two and three jobs, and the 800,000 federal workers who recently went 35 days without getting paid, all while this Administration gives away a trillion dollars to big corporations. When you hear claims about rewriting rules and cutting red tape, don't forget that means workers will have fewer workplace safety protections, pregnant women will have fewer clinics to turn to for care, children will have drinking water that's less safe. And remember that those rules are being rewritten to help big corporations and powerful interests. When you hear claims about how America is stronger in the world, don't forget the farmers and consumers hurt by this Administration's trade wars, and don't forget our allies who are now concerned that the United States of America may not keep our commitments. When you hear claims that our problems would all be solved if we just built a wall on our southern border, don't forget the babies ripped from their mothers' arms and the refugees fleeing violence and abuse who are being turned away. But no matter what we hear tonight, I want everyone to remember this. The strength of our union has never been found in the walls we build. It's in our diversity and our unity , and that is our power. We see the State of our Union in the working mom who's also working to earn her college degree We see it in the firefighter in California who works around the clock to battle a wildfire, knowing her own home is at risk of being demolished. We see it in the formerly incarcerated individual who re-enters society looking to contribute and in the Dreamer who pursues her future as a doctor in the face of fear and uncertainty that she'll be deported. We see it in the unpaid air traffic controller who still goes to work and helps safely land a plane and the neighbors who bring food to furloughed families. At this difficult moment, we can have faith that the American people are spirited, resourceful, and resilient. And because of them, we can come together around that common purpose. So thank you everyone. And after the speech, I hope that you'll all tune in to the official Democratic and Spanish-language responses from my friends Stacey Abrams and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1321729\/senator-harris-before-state-of-the-union-the-american-people-are-spirited-resourceful-and-resilient&speechType=6","Summary":"National Security Executive Branch Government Operations Trade Immigration","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/senator-harris-before-state-of-the-union-the-american-people-are-spirited-resourceful-and-resilient","CleanText":"Tonight, U.S. Senator Kamala D.

Harris reintroduced the Do No Harm Act, legislation to amend the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) to ensure that the law can no longer be invoked to threaten fundamental civil and legal rights. Since its 1993 inception, RFRA has been used to discriminate against and harm others, including LGBTQ individuals, women, and children. Companion legislation will also be reintroduced today in the House by Representatives Joe Kennedy (D-MA) and Bobby Scott (D-VA). \"The freedom to worship is one of our nation's most fundamental rights. That First Amendment guarantee should never be used to undermine other Americans' civil rights or subject them to discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity,\" said Harris. \"I'm proud to reintroduce the Do No Harm Act to more comprehensively protect the basic rights of every American.\" In 1993, Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in response to a Supreme Court case undermining the rights of religious minorities. But since its passage, twenty-one states have passed state RFRAs, and the laws have been used to defend employment discrimination against LGBTQ individuals, deny health care coverage for employees, claim exemptions to civil rights law, and complicate justice in child labor and abuse cases. The Do No Harm Act would prevent the RFRA law from being used to deny: Protection against discrimination laws or the promotion of equal opportunity, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other laws;Workplace protections or protections against child abuse;Healthcare access, information, referrals, provisions, coverage or services to which persons are otherwise legally entitled;Services that the government has contracted to be provided to beneficiaries through a government contract, grant, or cooperative agreement; andAccommodations or other benefits and services provided by the government. In addition to Harris, the bill is co-sponsored by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tom Carper (D-DE), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Patty Murray (D-WA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Tina Smith (D-MN), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

Harris (D-CA) joined her colleagues to reintroduce the Stop Shackling and Detaining Pregnant Women Act. The legislation would protect the health and safety of pregnant women and youth by reinstituting the presumption of release of pregnant women and youth in immigration detention, further prohibiting the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from shackling pregnant women in its custody, and setting new standards of care and transparency for the treatment of pregnant women and youth. The bill was first introduced last summer in light of reports of mistreatment of pregnant women in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, and was reintroduced on the heels of a recent Washington Post report about a women in ICE custody whose pregnancy ended in a stillbirth after she went into labor prematurely. \"Detaining pregnant women in poor conditions doesn't make our country safer, it's cruel and immoral,\" said Harris. \"I am committed to ensuring that children and pregnant mothers at the border receive proper medical care and will continue to fight for their human rights.\" Along with Senator Harris, the legislation is cosponsored by Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), Senator Tom Carper (D-DE), Senator Bob Casey (D-PA), Senator Chris Coons (D-DE), Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT), Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Senator Tina Smith (D-MN), Senator Tom Udall (D-NM), Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR).

The LWCF supports projects across California that preserve the state's wildlife, protect Californians' access to clean air and clean water, and fuel California's $92 billion outdoor recreation economy, the largest in the nation. \"I'm thrilled that my legislation to preserve historic HBCU buildings and to establish a memorial to the lives lost in the 1928 St. Francis Dam disaster have been signed into law along with a permanent reauthorization for the Land and Water Conservation Fund,\" said Harris. \"This legislation improves the stability of our nation's infrastructure and the health of our environment while also ensuring that we honor and remember the past.\" Senator Harris' bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) Historic Preservation Program for fiscal years 2019 to 2025 was included into the lands package and signed into law.

Harris (D-CA) released the following statement today on California Governor Gavin Newsom's announcement of a moratorium on the state's death penalty. Harris has opposed the death penalty throughout her career in law enforcement: \"This is an important day for justice and for the state of California. I applaud Governor Newsom for his decision to place a moratorium on the death penalty. As a career law enforcement official, I have opposed the death penalty because it is immoral, discriminatory, ineffective, and a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars. \"The symbol of our justice system is a woman with a blindfold. It is supposed to treat all equally, but the application of the death penalty - a final and irreversible punishment - has been proven to be unequally applied. Black and Latino defendants are far more likely to be executed than their white counterparts. Poor defendants without a team of lawyers are far more likely to enter death row than those with strong representation. Your race or your bank account shouldn't determine your sentence. \"It is also a waste of taxpayer money. The California Legislative Analyst's office estimates that California would save $150 million a year if it replaced the death penalty with a sentence of life without parole. That's money that could go into schools, health care, or restorative justice programs. It is not a smart way to keep people safe. \"I believe if evidence proves one human being murdered another human being, there should be swift and severe punishment. But the death penalty in America has been imposed as a final punishment to many who were later found to be innocent. Between 1973 and 2016, for every ten people executed, more than one person has been exonerated. Killing one innocent person would be too many. It's time to turn the page on this chapter and end a deeply flawed system of capital punishment in California.\"","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1330847\/senator-kamala-harris-on-california-death-penalty-moratorium&speechType=6","Summary":"Death Penalty","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/senator-kamala-harris-on-california-death-penalty-moratorium","CleanText":"This is an important day for justice and for the state of California.

Harris (D-CA) joined her colleagues to introduce legislation to expand Social Security benefits and strengthen the retirement program for generations to come. The legislation would increase benefits by about $1,342 a year for seniors now making less than $16,000 annually and increase cost-of-living adjustments by more accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors. \"In the richest nation in the world, it is a travesty that so many Americans are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living,\" said Harris. \"Over the past two years, this administration has been more focused on cutting taxes for the top one percent than making sure families can make ends meet. We need to expand Social Security and provide our seniors and other beneficiaries of this vital program with greater dignity and peace of mind.\" Social Security is one of the most popular and successful government programs. Before Social Security was created in 1935, about half of America's seniors were living in poverty. Today the senior poverty rate is just 8.8 percent. Yet, despite this success, one out of every five seniors are trying to survive on an income of less than $13,500 a year and about half of Americans 55 and older have zero retirement savings. The bill would ensure that Social Security could pay every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 52 years, according to the retirement system's chief actuary. It would extend the program's solvency by making the wealthiest 1.8 percent of Americans , those with incomes of more than $250,000 a year , pay the same rate into the retirement system as everyone else already pays. Current law caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $132,900.

Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday joined Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), along with 12 of their colleagues, in introducing the GI Education Benefits Fairness Act, legislation that would support veterans' families by extending Post-9\/11 GI Bill education benefits to foster children and legal wards. \"Members of the military make sacrifices every day for our nation, and we should do everything we can to support them and their families,\" said Harris. \"This legislation would make a common-sense fix to the Post\/911 GI Bill to ensure that veterans and their families are receiving the education benefits they deserve.\" The Post-9\/11 GI Bill provides education benefits to veterans and service members. It also allows active duty troops to transfer their unused education benefits to a spouse or child. Under current law, while the Department of Defense (DOD) includes wards and foster children in the definition of an eligible child, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) does not. This has led to a bureaucratic nightmare for some members of the armed services and their families. The GI Education Benefits Fairness Act would amend the definition of an \"eligible child\" for the purposes of transferability of benefits under the Post 9\/11 Educational Assistance Program to include the DOD definition of a child , which includes wards and foster children. Doing so would allow foster children and wards to receive the education funding they deserve, including providing retroactive pay for those foster children and wards who were previously approved for GI education benefits only to have them revoked. Along with Harris, Durbin, and Duckworth, the bill is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Jon Tester (D-MT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Gary Peters (D-MI), Doug Jones (D-AL), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tom Udall (D-NM), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

Harris (D-CA) on Tuesday reintroduced the Rent Relief Act, legislation to provide much-needed support to middle class and working Americans who are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of rent. The legislation creates a new, refundable tax credit for households whose housing costs exceed 30% of their income, including rent and utilities. Unlike existing tax credits, Americans who qualify would receive the benefits every month. Harris was joined by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) in reintroducing the legislation. \"Housing is a human right, and we must act now to end the affordable housing crisis and provide relief to working families who are worried about making each month's rent,\" said Harris. \"Right now, nearly half of Americans couldn't afford an emergency $400 expense , these families need help now. This is about more than just economics, it's about the basic security and dignity that every American deserves to have in their own home.\" Under the Rent Relief Act, a household's credit would be determined by their income and the amount spent on housing costs (rent, utilities) in excess of 30% of their gross income. According to the Columbia Center on Poverty and Social Policy, the Rent Relief Act, which was first introduced in 2018, would reduce the poverty rate by as much as 2.4%, lifting 7.8 million Americans out of poverty, including more than 2 million children. Approximately 21 million Americans spend more than 30% of their earnings on rent, with a disproportionate and rising burden falling on families of color.

It would significantly lower the price of prescription drugs by empowering the federal government to negotiate with pharmaceutical corporations. Furthermore, it would expand coverage to include home and community based long-term care services, ensuring people with disabilities can receive the care they need to stay in their homes and remain part of their communities.

The legislation would expand access to affordable birth control for women across the nation, including those in communities that face health disparities and greater challenges getting the care they need like women of color, women with disabilities, low-income women, and women in rural areas, while maintaining the FDA's sole authority to determine the safety and efficacy of drugs. It comes on the heels of the administration's ongoing efforts to undermine women's health, including its efforts to roll back protections that prevent women from being charged extra for birth control and to sabotage the Title X family planning program which helps women across the country get affordable health care, including contraceptive care. \"Right now, reproductive rights are under attack in our country,\" said Senator Harris. \"We must do more to ensure women have access to affordable reproductive health care, including contraception. I'm proud to stand with my colleagues in introducing this bill to make birth control available over-the-counter while keeping it covered by insurance. This legislation will help secure economic and reproductive justice for all women.\" In addition to Harris and Murray, the legislation is co-sponsored by Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jack Reed (D-RI), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Gary Peters (D-MI), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Tina Smith (D-MN). The legislation has been endorsed by: National Women's Law Center (NWLC), Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR), National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health (NLIRH), In Our Own Voice, National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum (NAPAWF), National Partnership for Women & Families (NPWF), National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA), NARAL, Planned Parenthood, Guttmacher Institute, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Physicians for Reproductive Health, an Power to Decide. The Affordability Is Access Act (AAA) will: Ensure coverage of comprehensive preventive health services and expand coverage to include full access to oral contraception for routine, daily over-the-counter use for all women. All private health insurance plans are now required to cover all U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved methods of contraception. The Act would ensure coverage of all oral contraception that the FDA has approved or regulated for routine, daily use without a prescription.Maintain the FDA's sole authority to determine the safety and efficacy of drugs and make them available over-the-counter without a prescription. It is imperative that the entities that research and develop oral contraceptives, and whose medical and scientific experts have developed clinical and other evidence that birth control pills are safe and effective for women when sold without a prescription, apply to the FDA for review and approval for sale without a prescription.Upon the receipt of such an application, the FDA must determine whether the contraceptive product meets the rigorous safety, and efficacy standards for over-the-counter use, as established by the agency Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If the product meets such these standards, the FDA should approve the application without delay. Ensure Retailers Provide Oral Contraception without a Prescription. The Act states that any retailer that stocks oral contraception that the FDA has approved or regulated for routine, daily use without a prescription may not interfere with a consumer's access to or purchase of such contraception.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1350524\/harris-colleagues-introduce-legislation-pushing-for-affordable-over-the-counter-birth-control&speechType=6","Summary":"Reproduction","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-colleagues-introduce-legislation-pushing-for-affordable-over-the-counter-birth-control","CleanText":"Right now, reproductive rights are under attack in our country.

Harris joined Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and 5 of their colleagues in introducing the Citizenship Affordability Act, legislation to preserve and expand access to citizenship by ensuring legal residents who are eligible for naturalization, but struggling to afford its cost, can access waivers to reduce or eliminate fees associated with the process. \"We are and have always been a nation of immigrants, and we should do all we can to provide a pathway to citizenship for those who have come here in search of a better life,\" said Senator Harris. \"I'm proud to co-sponsor this legislation that will ensure that the cost of the naturalization process is not a barrier to becoming a full and active participant in our civic life. Our diversity is our strength, and we must foster it.\" Currently, aspiring American citizens eligible for naturalization are required to pay USCIS an application fee of $640 plus $85 biometric fee for a total of $725 per applicant. Those expenses can quickly snowball if people must pay for lawyers, English classes, and civics test preparation. If several family members are applying, costs multiply. Legal residents who earn less than 150 percent of the Federal Poverty Level can apply for a full fee waiver and a reduced fee for those earning less than 200 percent. The fee waivers do not apply to those making between 200 and 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, many of whom still struggle to afford the fees associated with naturalization. USCIS is proposing changing the eligibility requirements for fee waivers and limit access to the naturalization fee waiver. This legislation would preserve and expand who is eligible for a fee waiver and ensure citizenship is affordable to all who are legally eligible to apply. The Citizenship Affordability Act is supported by national and local organizations such as NALEO, UnidosUS, National Partnership for New Americans, Church World Service, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), American Friends Service Committee NJ, HIAS Pennsylvania, Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, Refugee Women's Alliance (Seattle, WA), Sunflower Community Action, Kansas People's Action, Pennsylvania Immigration and Citizenship Coalition, Nebraska Appleseed, Promise Arizona and Dream Big Nevada. The Citizenship Affordability Act would: Make permanent full and partial income-based Naturalization Fee Waivers.Codify the full fee waiver for naturalization fees for: filing to preserve residence for naturalization purposes; filing an application for certificate of citizenship; filing an application for a replacement naturalization or citizenship document; the filing of an application for citizenship and issuance of certificate under section 322 of the Immigration and Nationality Act; and biometrics capture and background checks.Codify and raise to 250 percent of the federal poverty level the partial fee waiver for the same fees.Require the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider the receipt of means-tested benefits as evidence of eligibility for the fee waivers.Joining Senators Harris and Menendez on this bill are Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Patty Murray (D-WA), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Mazie Hirono (D-HI).","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1350520\/harris-colleagues-introduce-bicameral-bill-to-preserve-and-expand-access-to-naturalization&speechType=6","Summary":"Immigration","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-colleagues-introduce-bicameral-bill-to-preserve-and-expand-access-to-naturalization","CleanText":"We are and have always been a nation of immigrants, and we should do all we can to provide a pathway to citizenship for those who have come here in search of a better life.

Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday introduced the 21st Century Skills are Key to Individuals' Life-Long Success (SKILLS) Act, legislation to make high-quality training, education, and supportive services more accessible for workers to help them secure 21st century jobs. As offshoring, automation, artificial intelligence, and other technological advances fundamentally change the future of work in our country, American workers face unprecedented challenges in obtaining the skills required to remain competitive in the global economy. Already, 52% of unemployed Americans believe they need more education or training for the jobs they want, but only 26% took a class or pursued additional training to acquire those skills. Too often, workers are either unaware of training opportunities or unable to afford the costs associated with developing new skills. \"Today's economy is rapidly changing and will require many workers to build on their existing skills or obtain new skills throughout the course of their careers,\" said Sen. Harris. \"It is critical that Congress and employers recognize the importance of workforce development in order for our country to remain competitive in the global economy. This legislation makes a serious investment in our workers by removing barriers to securing the good-paying jobs of today and the future , including covering the costs of high-quality training and education programs and critical supports, such as child care, transportation, and books.\" The 21st Century SKILLS Act will: Establish accounts for American workers to access skills training and other educational opportunities, as well as pay costs associated with pursuing that opportunity, such as child care and transportation costs. Up to 78 million Americans will be eligible for:$8,000 if they are unemployed, dislocated, or employed and earning under 50% of state median income.$6,000 if they are employed and earning 50-75% of state median income.$4,000 if they are employed and earning 75-100% of state median income.Increase transparency and accountability in the workforce development system to ensure workers maintain access to high-quality, high-value training opportunities.Require states to set minimum levels of performance for training providers to remain eligible for training account funds.Create tools to compare employment outcome data across programs, providers, and states.Establish a grant program to encourage employers, education and training providers, labor, local workforce boards, and community-based organizations to collaborate to identify a community's needs and align training and education opportunities with local employment demand.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1354957\/harris-introduces-21st-century-skills-act-to-invest-in-workforce-training&speechType=6","Summary":"Employment and Affirmative Action","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-introduces-21st-century-skills-act-to-invest-in-workforce-training","CleanText":"Today's economy is rapidly changing and will require many workers to build on their existing skills or obtain new skills throughout the course of their careers.

Harris (D-CA) on Thursday introduced the PrEP Access and Coverage Act, legislation to dramatically expand Americans' access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), medication that when taken daily reduces the risk of HIV infection by up to 92%. HIV disproportionately impacts gay and bisexual men, transgender women, and, in particular, people of color. Members of communities at the intersections of these groups are most heavily impacted. A generic form of PrEP is expected to enter the market in 2020, but the high cost of the medication, combined with out-of-pocket costs for follow-up visits and lab testing, places barriers between PrEP and the more than 1 million people who would most benefit from it. \"PrEP is a critical advancement in the fight against HIV that can finally provide peace of mind to Americans who live in the shadow of the HIV epidemic. But for too many in our country, lack of insurance coverage and steep costs have put PrEP out of reach, and that needs to change,\" said Harris. \"We must truly commit ourselves to HIV prevention by finally requiring every health insurance plan, public and private, to cover PrEP and all of the required tests and follow-up doctors' visits. We must also provide the resources necessary to help people without insurance access PrEP. Nearly four decades since the beginning of the HIV\/AIDS crisis that took so many lives and caused countless others to live in fear, we can and will stop the spread of this disease.\" On June 11, 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gave PrEP an \"A\" rating as a preventive service. This rating means that private insurance companies will have to cover PrEP without cost-sharing for those individuals by 2021. Harris' legislation goes further by requiring that all private and public insurance plans, including Medicare and Medicaid, cover without a copay not only the drug itself but also all associated doctors' visits, tests, and monitoring recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1354947\/harris-introduces-bill-to-dramatically-expand-access-to-prep&speechType=6","Summary":"Health Insurance","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-introduces-bill-to-dramatically-expand-access-to-prep","CleanText":"PrEP is a critical advancement in the fight against HIV that can finally provide peace of mind to Americans who live in the shadow of the HIV epidemic.

The bill would impose important reporting requirements for contacts between the Justice Department and White House pertaining to specific cases or investigations. In May, Harris questioned Attorney General William Barr before the Senate Judiciary Committee about whether the president or anyone in the White House had directed him to open an investigation into any individual. Barr refused to answer. \"The administration of justice should be blind, not driven by politics. But the President's attempts to derail the Mueller investigation, paired with Attorney General Barr's refusal to give clear answers to Congress, have raised serious concerns about DOJ's independence,\" said Harris. \"The honor system isn't enough anymore , we need a law. I'm proud to work with Senators Whitehouse and Blumenthal to create transparency and give Congress important oversight tools to help restore the American people's trust in the Department of Justice.\" The Justice Department has historically enjoyed a measure of independence from political interference in order to ensure even-handed administration of the laws. While presidents and White House officials may properly engage with the Department on broad policy questions, it threatens the equal and just administration of law when the White House seeks to influence Department decision-making on individual law enforcement matters. When this important norm has been violated, presidents have received heavy criticism. Although both the Department and the White House have long maintained policies that define and prohibit such inappropriate contacts, these policies lack the force of law and can be violated without remedy. As a result, presidential administrations have continued to violate this norm. Under President Trump, the principle of Department independence has further deteriorated, demonstrating clearly that the current contacts policies are not effective. Indeed, public reporting has revealed numerous contacts between White House and Department officials that, on their face, violate the contacts policies. The Security from Political Interference in Justice Act would help to ensure the Justice Department's independence by increasing transparency and accountability in the relationship between the White House and the Department. The bill would require that: Both the White House and Justice Department log all communications between White House and Justice officials and staff pertaining to specific cases or investigations that DOJ might undertake. The log would include (1) the names of participants in the communication, (2) the topics of the communications, and (3) a statement describing the purpose and necessity of the communication.The logs be disclosed every six months to Congress and to the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility of the Department. It directs Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility to review the logs and to notify Congress if any of the logged communications are inappropriate from a law enforcement perspective or raise concerns about improper political interference. The bill exempts certain top-level contacts from disclosure to Congress, but requires those contacts to be logged, shared with the Inspector General's office and the Office of Professional Responsibility, and disclosed in response to a Congressional subpoena. Both the logging and disclosure requirements would remain in place irrespective of the White House and\/or Department's internal contacts policies.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1354941\/harris-whitehouse-blumenthal-introduce-bill-to-protect-independence-of-justice-department&speechType=6","Summary":"Executive Branch Government Operations","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-whitehouse-blumenthal-introduce-bill-to-protect-independence-of-justice-department","CleanText":"The administration of justice should be blind, not driven by politics.

Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday joined Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and 33 of their colleagues in introducing the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act of 2019, legislation that will guarantee the right of public employees to organize, act concertedly, and bargain collectively in states that currently do not afford these basic protections. There are nearly 17.3 million public workers across the country. Unlike private sector workers, there is no federal law protecting the freedom of public sector workers to join a union and collectively bargain for fair wages, benefits, and improved working conditions. \"When workers have the ability to organize and collectively bargain, we're all better off,\" Senator Harris said. \"We have unions to thank for the five-day work week, eight-hour work day, and so much more. Today, as the Supreme Court chips away at the rights of public sector unions, we must take action to reaffirm union rights and ensure that public employees maintain their hard-fought protections and keep the ability to bargain for higher wages and better benefits.\" The Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act of 2019 provides the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) with the authority to determine whether a state, territory, or locality provides public employees and supervisors the right: To form, join, or assist a union, to bargain collectively, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid (including the filing of joint, class or collective legal claims) or protection;To have their union recognized by their public employer if the union is freely chosen by a majority of employees, to bargain with the employer through the union, and to commit their collective-bargaining agreement to writing;To be free from forced recertification elections of their already-recognized representative and decertification of their chosen representative within one year of an election or the expiration of a valid collective bargaining agreement;To have a procedure for resolving impasses in collective bargaining culminating in binding arbitration; andTo authorize employers to deduct fees to the union from their payroll when employees consent.The FLRA approach gives states wide flexibility to write and administer their own labor laws provided they meet this minimum standard. If a state substantially provides for the rights and procedures laid out in the bill, that state is unaffected by this bill. States that do not provide for these rights or only partially provide for these rights, however, will be compelled to meet these basic labor standards. The FLRA must issue regulations within one year of the bill becoming law and they can enforce the law through federal court. The bill also creates a private right of action to enforce compliance in federal court but only if the FLRA has not yet filed suit seeking relief for the same issue.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1354924\/harris-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-strengthen-rights-of-public-sector-workers-to-join-unions-bargain-collectively&speechType=6","Summary":"Employment and Affirmative Action Labor Unions","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-strengthen-rights-of-public-sector-workers-to-join-unions-bargain-collectively","CleanText":"When workers have the ability to organize and collectively bargain, we're all better off.

The legislation will correct the military records of service members discharged solely due to their sexual orientation to reflect their honorable service and reinstate the benefits they earned. \"All of our nation's service members are entitled to the honor and benefits they earn, regardless of who they are or who they love,\" said Senator Harris. \"I'm proud to co-sponsor the Restore Honor to Service Members Act. These brave men and women have sacrificed so much for our country and Congress should fix the mistakes of the past.\" Since World War II, more than 100,000 Americans are estimated to have been discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation. Those forced out of the military may have left with discharge statuses of \"other than honorable,\" \"general discharge\" or \"dishonorable,\" depending on the circumstances. As a consequence, many of these service members may be disqualified from accessing certain benefits that they earned and are entitled to, and may not be able to claim veteran status. The consequences of a negative discharge also include preventing some veterans from voting or making it more difficult for them to acquire civilian employment. Many veterans who were affected by discriminatory policies such as Don't Ask, Don't Tell do not know that they can have their records corrected or initiate a review. This legislation would require the Department of Defense to reach out to veterans who faced discrimination because of their sexual orientation about the Department's process for correcting their records.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1354922\/harris-feinstein-colleagues-reintroduce-legislation-to-restore-honor-to-service-members-discharged-due-to-sexual-orientation&speechType=6","Summary":"Military Personnel Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-feinstein-colleagues-reintroduce-legislation-to-restore-honor-to-service-members-discharged-due-to-sexual-orientation","CleanText":"All of our nation's service members are entitled to the honor and benefits they earn, regardless of who they are or who they love.

Harris joined Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and 14 of their colleagues in introducing legislation to block immigration enforcement actions at sensitive locations like schools, hospitals, and religious institutions without prior approval and exigent circumstances. The Protecting Sensitive Locations Act codifies the Department of Homeland Security's existing policies and expands on those policies to ensure that immigrants are able to access education, criminal justice, and social services without fear of deportation. \"The president and his administration have spent years demonizing immigrants and stoking fear in immigrant communities , that must end,\" said Senator Harris. \"The priority of law enforcement officers should be promoting the safety of the communities they protect, not rounding up immigrants at schools, hospitals, and places of worship. A victim of a crime should be able to run into the street and flag down a police officer instead of being made to feel like the criminal.

The bill is also supported by more than 300 national, state, and local organizations. The Protecting Sensitive Locations Act requires that, except in special circumstances, ICE agents receive prior approval from a supervisor when there are exigent circumstances before engaging in enforcement actions at sensitive locations, such as: schools, hospitals and health clinics, places of worship, organizations assisting crime victims, and organizations that provide services to children, pregnant women, victims of crime or abuse, or individuals with mental or physical disabilities.

Harris (D-CA) on Tuesday reintroduced the Access to Counsel Act and the Detention Oversight, Not Expansion (DONE) Act, two bills that would promote the fair treatment of immigrants facing detention in response to the Trump administration's inhumane immigration policies. \"For years, this president and his administration have demonized immigrants and committed human rights abuses against immigrants seeking refuge in our country. Enough is enough,\" said Harris. \"We must take steps to affirm the basic human dignity of those who come to our country seeking a better life, and that starts with ensuring legal representation to those who cross the border and fixing the inhumane conditions at ICE detention centers.\" The Access to Counsel Act would ensure that individuals held or detained while attempting to enter the United States, whether at a border crossing or a port of entry, are guaranteed access to legal counsel. Originally introduced in 2017, the Access to Counsel Act was the first bill Harris introduced as a United States senator. Specifically, the Access to Counsel Act would: Affirm that the right to access to counsel attaches at the time of holding or detention.Provide a redress option if counsel cannot personally meet with detained individuals requiring provision of legal advice remotely (e.g., phone or Video Teleconference).Invalidate any effort by immigration enforcement officials to persuade someone to relinquish their legal status (by executing a Record of Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status or Withdrawal of Application for Admission) if that person has been denied access to counsel.Direct that immigration enforcement officials shall limit detention to the briefest term possible and least restrictive conditions practicable, and will include access to food, water, and restroom facilities.Supporters of the legislation include UnidosUS, Amnesty International, Women's Refugee Commission, Human Rights Watch, Church World Services, CHIRLA, United We Dream, AILA, National Immigration Law Center, International Refugee Assistance Project, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Columbia Law School Immigrants' Rights Clinic, HIAS, National Center for Transgender Equality, The Council on American-Islamic Relations, National Education Association, Friends Committee on National Legislation, MomsRising, J Street, The Latin America Working Group, Indivisible, The Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, RAICES Texas, KIND, The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, WOLA, OneJustice, Arab American Institute Foundation, Center Global (a program of the DC Center for the LGBT Community), and South Asian Americans Leading Together. In addition to Harris, co-sponsors of the Access to Counsel Act include Senators Blumenthal (D-CT), Markey (D-MA), Warren (D-MA), Merkley (D-OR), Gillibrand (D-NY), and Booker (D-NJ). The DONE Act would place a moratorium on further expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers by halting funds for construction or expansion of new facilities and increase visibility into conditions at existing facilities. Since Harris originally introduced this legislation in 2018, the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General has found egregious violations of detention standards at four ICE detention facilities, including nooses in detainee cells, expired food, dilapidated and moldy bathroom facilities, and insufficient provision for appropriate clothing and hygiene items. The DONE Act would: Require the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to submit a report to Congress that includes a plan to decrease the number of detention beds by 50% of the number available during fiscal year 2018 by using alternatives to detention that are less costly to the taxpayer and have been shown to be successful.Require the DHS Office of Inspector General to conduct unannounced inspections of ICE detention facilities to ensure compliance with national standards, focusing on the health, safety, and care of detainees, especially as it relates to pregnant women. DHS OIG shall submit a report of its findings to Congress.Require the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to conduct investigations and submit a report of its findings to Congress.Mandate that facility contracts will be terminated for facilities receiving less than adequate ratings in the two most recent inspections, audits, or investigations conducted by DHS OIG.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1361671\/harris-reintroduces-legislation-addressing-rights-and-conditions-of-immigrants-in-detention&speechType=6","Summary":"Immigration","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-reintroduces-legislation-addressing-rights-and-conditions-of-immigrants-in-detention","CleanText":"For years, this president and his administration have demonized immigrants and committed human rights abuses against immigrants seeking refuge in our country.

Harris (D-CA) on Tuesday introduced the Basic Assistance for Students In College (BASIC) Act, legislation to ensure that college students, particularly those receiving Pell Grants or attending a community college or minority-serving institution, are able to afford basic, day-to-day necessities. Co-sponsors of the BASIC Act include U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). According to a recent Government Accountability Office report, more than 30% of college students may face food insecurity. At HBCUs in particular, students often live in food deserts where they lack convenient access to grocery stores or restaurants. This issue is particularly pronounced among community college students: a recent survey by the HOPE Center found that two-thirds of community college students are food insecure and half are housing insecure, including 14 percent who have experienced homelessness. Students and institutions alike have been grappling with how the cost of basic necessities presents significant barriers to student welfare and academic success. \"No student, no matter their circumstances, should have to worry about going hungry or keeping a roof over their head,\" said Harris. \"We cannot accept a status quo in which young people seeking a higher education are unable to afford life's necessities. I'm proud to introduce the BASIC Act to make sure every college student can focus on learning above all else.\" The BASIC Act would: Establish a $500 million competitive grant program to help institutions of higher education identify and meet the basic needs of students, including food, housing, transportation, child care, health care, and technology.Require at least 25% of grants to go to community colleges. Grant priority will also go to institutions with 25% or higher Pell enrollment, HBCUs, and other minority-serving institutions.Requires the Department of Education to coordinate with the Departments of Agriculture, Housing & Urban Development, and Health & Human Services to develop and implement an agreement to: Securely share data to identify current students who may be eligible for federal means-tested programs, including SNAP, SSI, TANF, WIC, Medicaid, and federal housing assistance; andCoordinate efforts to help institutions of higher education enroll eligible students in these programs.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1361683\/harris-introduces-basic-act-to-help-college-students-afford-basic-needs&speechType=6","Summary":"Higher Education","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-introduces-basic-act-to-help-college-students-afford-basic-needs","CleanText":"No student, no matter their circumstances, should have to worry about going hungry or keeping a roof over their head.

Harris (D-CA) joined Senator Tom Udall (D-NM), along with Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) in introducing the Homeland Security Improvement Act, legislation that addresses some of the nation's immigration challenges at the southwest border and improves Department of Homeland Security (DHS) engagement with border communities. The bill establishes an ombudsman for border and immigration enforcement related concerns within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to better ensure accountability, transparency, and oversight. The corresponding House bill sponsored by U.S. Representative Veronica Escobar (D-TX), H.R. 2203, passed in a 230-194 vote in September 2019. \"Since the beginning of this administration, the Department of Homeland Security has been a party to human rights abuses against immigrant children, multiple deaths in U.S. custody, abhorrent conditions in detention centers, and so much more. DHS's actions have shocked the American people and severely damaged our nation's standing as a safe haven for those fleeing violence and oppression,\" said Harris. \"We must prevent this in the future. We must require training, oversight, and accountability within DHS to ensure the department respects the basic dignity of every person.\" Currently, DHS develops its own rules and policies for the conduct of operations along the border without meaningful input from stakeholders, particularly border communities , creating increasing tension between the agency and the public. The Homeland Security Improvement Act significantly improves DHS operations by mandating community input on enforcement policies and programs and improves transparency by requiring robust reporting on actions and operations. DHS routinely fails to respond, investigate, or provide appropriate redress to public complaints. Complainants frequently wait months or years, only to receive form letters, if anything at all, in response to serious complaints alleging misconduct and mismanagement. DHS also directs individuals to file complaints through a confusing variety of processes, resulting in departmental inefficiency and public confusion about where and how to address concerns. This inadequate process exacerbates tensions between the agency and the communities in which it operates, which contributes to public dissatisfaction and lower agency morale. The creation of an ombudsman will alleviate these issues by increasing transparency and accountability and assisting individuals in resolving complaints.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1381562\/harris-senate-democrats-introduce-the-homeland-security-improvement-act&speechType=6","Summary":"National Security","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-senate-democrats-introduce-the-homeland-security-improvement-act","CleanText":"Since the beginning of this administration, the Department of Homeland Security has been a party to human rights abuses against immigrant children, multiple deaths in U.S. custody, abhorrent conditions in detention centers, and so much more.

I am absolutely committed to helping California receive every federal resource necessary to fight these fires, help those affected recover, and build more resilient communities as we look to the future. \"California must not be made to fight alone in this, the federal government can and must do more to help our state mitigate the impact of these wildfires and blackouts. Already, I've confirmed with FEMA that Pre-Disaster Mitigation funds can be used toward microgrid infrastructure that would help communities maintain power for critical facilities during large-scale blackouts. \"But that's not nearly enough. Any long-term solution to this crisis needs to involve serious accountability for California's utility companies, which for too long have avoided making the investments necessary to maintain safe power lines and adapt to the challenges posed by climate change. We need a more resilient and distributed energy system in our state, and we need to start providing communities with the resources they need to build resilience to power shutoffs and defense to wildfires. We also need to ensure that FEMA understands and is properly equipped to deal with the unique challenges wildfires present in California and in other states across the nation. \"As the climate crisis contributes to the growing frequency and intensity of these fires, we must finally begin to take seriously the threat posed by extreme weather and recognize that blackouts and wildfires have the greatest impact on vulnerable communities, such as people with disabilities, the elderly, children, low-income communities, and communities of color. Keeping our state safe and securing climate justice will require us to work towards a bold, comprehensive solution to fight climate change and preserve our planet for our children and grandchildren. \"Congress has a responsibility to take action as well, which is why I'm drafting legislation that will provide communities with the funding they need to invest in science-based strategies to protect themselves from wildfires, such as hardening infrastructure, implementing microgrids and other distributed energy resources, maintaining defensible space, evacuation planning, and community education. \"Californians should not have to live in fear of a wildfire season that seems to get worse with every passing year. Fires are inevitable as part of the natural ecosystem, but the number of human-caused fires and the scale of destruction we've seen in recent memory is not. Wildfires are ultimately a foreseeable challenge that our state and communities can prepare for if provided with the appropriate resources and if we finally take a comprehensive approach to the climate crisis. California's elected officials across the local, state, and federal government must work together to protect our state, and I am committed to being a leader in this urgent and necessary effort.\"","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1381566\/harris-statement-on-wildfires-and-blackouts-across-california-long-term-solutions-to-climate-change-driven-crisis&speechType=6","Summary":"Environment","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-statement-on-wildfires-and-blackouts-across-california-long-term-solutions-to-climate-change-driven-crisis","CleanText":"My thoughts are with the tens of thousands of Californians who have been forced to evacuate their homes as wildfires have spread throughout our state, as well as the millions who have been impacted by blackouts.

But, this does not have to be the case. My bill provides an innovative solution that will help reduce the burden of child care on working families. It is time we modernize the school schedule to better meet the needs of our students and their families.\" Throughout the United States, current school schedules make life harder for working families. Research shows that schools are shut down for an average of 29 days throughout the school year. With the vast majority of schools closing at or around 3 pm, two hours short of the standard full-time work day, parents are often left in a bind. Additionally, summer breaks present a challenge; in fact, three in four parents report at least some difficulty finding child care during that time period. The economic cost of this problem is substantial. Schools are closed for two weeks longer than the typical American with paid leave has in paid holidays and vacation. Further, 39 percent of all workers, and 80 percent of low-wage workers, lack access to any paid vacation time. This places a financial burden on parents and caregivers to either pay for additional child care or take leave without pay to care for their child. While the misalignment of school and work schedules affects all families, low-income households often shoulder the greatest burden especially those with unpredictable or inflexible work schedules. The Family Friendly Schools Act will create a first-of-its-kind pilot program to give schools resources to stay open during the entire work day throughout the school year and to invest over $1 billion in enriching summer learning programs , all without forcing teachers to work longer hours or for less pay.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1382388\/harris-introduces-family-friendly-schools-act&speechType=6","Summary":"K-12 Education Family","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-introduces-family-friendly-schools-act","CleanText":"My mother raised my sister and me while working demanding, long hours.

This year in California, utility companies have left millions of people up and down the state without power in order to avoid sparking wildfires and to limit their own legal and financial liability. \"Years of corporate negligence and misplaced priorities by energy utilities like PG&E have caused devastating fires and costly blackouts, which is exactly what happens when publicly traded utilities put corporate profits and stock prices above their customers and public safety,\" said Harris. \"My commonsense bill will make sure executives of bankrupt utility companies won't be rewarded with big bonuses and free trips after their failures leave millions of people without essential services like power or water.

Harris (D-CA) on Tuesday introduced the Preparing Superfund for Climate Change Act, legislation requiring the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to incorporate climate change into their plans for overseeing Superfund sites, which contain toxic waste and other contaminants harmful to Americans' health. While the Trump administration yesterday rejected a recommendation from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to consider the impact of climate change on these toxic waste sites, Harris' legislation would mandate this under the law. On Monday, the GAO released a report concluding that Superfund sites across the country are underprepared for the impact of the climate crisis, which has the potential to disrupt toxic sites and release contaminants into the environment and surrounding communities. In December 2017, Harris led a letter to the GAO requesting such a report. \"We can no longer ignore the fact that the climate crisis is here and it's in our backyard. Hurricanes, wildfires, and other natural disasters are growing in intensity and threatening to unleash some of our nation's most toxic sites on surrounding areas, especially waste sites located in close proximity to low-income communities and communities of color,\" said Senator Harris. \"My legislation will ensure that the EPA and those responsible incorporate climate change into cleanup plans for current and future Superfund sites and that we are preserving our nation's ability to clean up pollution and protect communities in the era of a changing climate.\" In recent years, natural disasters have had a direct impact on Superfund sites and risked serious harm to communities already reeling from the devastation of natural disasters. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey led to floods at 13 Superfund sites and breaches at two. In 2018, the Carr Fire in California burned through the Iron Mountain Mine site causing fires in pipes necessary to clean up the site and had the potential to result in an explosion that would have expelled dangerous chemicals throughout the surrounding area. Specifically, the Preparing Superfund for Climate Change Act: Requires the potential threat to human health and the environment associated with local natural disasters and hazards due to climate change to be incorporated into any plans to clean-up a superfund site; andRequires that local natural disasters and extreme weather hazards, including any projected exacerbation or change in those disasters and hazards due to climate change be taken into account in the periodic review of whether a clean-up plan is adequately protective.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1385269\/harris-introduces-legislation-to-ensure-toxic-waste-sites-are-resilient-to-climate-change&speechType=6","Summary":"Environment","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-introduces-legislation-to-ensure-toxic-waste-sites-are-resilient-to-climate-change","CleanText":"We can no longer ignore the fact that the climate crisis is here and it's in our backyard.

With the passage of the MORE Act today, the Judiciary Committee has taken long overdue steps to address the devastating injustices caused by the War on Drugs and to finally decriminalize marijuana at the federal level.\" The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act aims to correct the historical injustices of failed drug policies that have disproportionately impacted communities of color and low-income communities by requiring resentencing and expungement of prior convictions. This will create new opportunities for individuals as they work to advance their careers, education, and overall quality of life. Immigrants will also benefit from the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, as they will no longer be subject to deportation or citizenship denial based solely on a marijuana offense. The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act also ensures that all benefits in the law are available to juvenile offenders. Specifically, the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act: Legalizes marijuana at the federal level by removing the substance from the Controlled Substances Act. This applies retroactively to prior and pending convictions, and enables states to set their own policy.Requires federal courts to expunge prior convictions, allows prior offenders to request expungement, and requires courts, on motion, to conduct re-sentencing hearings for those still under supervision.Authorizes the assessment of a 5% sales tax on marijuana and marijuana products to create an Opportunity Trust Fund, which includes three grant programs:The Community Reinvestment Grant Program: Provides services to the individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs, including job training, re-entry services, legal aid, literacy programs, youth recreation, mentoring, and substance use treatment. The Cannabis Opportunity Grant Program: Provides funds for loans to assist small businesses in the marijuana industry that are owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.The Equitable Licensing Grant Program: Provides funds for programs that minimize barriers to marijuana licensing and employment for the individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.Opens up Small Business Administration funding for legitimate cannabis-related businesses and service providers.Provides non-discrimination protections for marijuana use or possession, and for prior convictions for a marijuana offense:Prohibits the denial of any federal public benefit (including housing) based on the use or possession of marijuana, or prior conviction for a marijuana offense.Provides that the use or possession of marijuana, or prior conviction for a marijuana offense, will have no adverse impact under the immigration laws.Requires the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect data on the demographics of the industry to ensure people of color and those who are economically disadvantaged are participating in the industry.The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act has the support of a broad coalition of civil rights, criminal justice, drug policy, and immigration groups.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1385845\/harris-applauds-house-committee-passage-of-marijuana-reform-legislation&speechType=6","Summary":"Marijuana","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-applauds-house-committee-passage-of-marijuana-reform-legislation","CleanText":"As more states legalize marijuana, millions of Americans with marijuana-related convictions continue to face overwhelming barriers to jobs, education, and housing.

Harris (D-CA) on Friday joined Senators Tom Udall (D-NM) and John Hoeven (R-ND), along with 22 senators and 52 representatives, in filing an amicus brief in federal court defending the constitutionality of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). The bipartisan and bicameral brief was filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit as the court re-opens its August ruling that affirmed ICWA's constitutionality in Brackeen v. Bernhardt. \"The Indian Child Welfare Act has protected Native American children and kept them connected with their families and communities for over 40 years,\" said Senator Harris. \"It is vital that the Fifth Circuit upholds the constitutionality of ICWA, we must support tribes as they fight to protect Native American children.\" The amicus brief urges the Fifth Circuit to uphold the court's previous decision affirming the constitutionality of IWCA. The decision the Fifth Circuit issued in August reversed a ruling from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas which wrongly struck down ICWA as unconstitutional. Congress passed ICWA in 1978 after receiving testimony that 25 to 35 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native children were removed from their homes by state and private adoption agencies. ICWA sets best-practice standards for child welfare and adoption proceedings involving children who are members of a federally-recognized Tribe or are eligible for membership in a federally-recognized Tribe. Over four decades, the law has become the \"gold standard\" for child welfare policy and keeping Native children connected to their communities and cultures.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1392226\/harris-lawmakers-file-amicus-brief-supporting-the-indian-child-welfare-act&speechType=6","Summary":"Minors and Children Indigenous Peoples Judicial Branch","Source":null,"Location":"Washington D.C.","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-lawmakers-file-amicus-brief-supporting-the-indian-child-welfare-act","CleanText":"The Indian Child Welfare Act has protected Native American children and kept them connected with their families and communities for over 40 years.

Harris (D-CA) on Monday delivered remarks on the floor of the United States Senate as the Senate prepared to receive articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. I n the speech, Harris laid out her view of the Senate's duty to ensure the integrity of the American system of justice, as well as her commitment to ensuring that nobody, including the president, is above the law. Key excerpts from Harris' remarks: We now face a choice: will we insist that we have one system of justice that applies equally to all? Or will we continue to have two systems of justice, in which some are above the law? [ ] This moment in our history will have consequences. The Senate is charged with deciding whether the President of the United States, with all of his power and supposed wealth, will be held accountable for his actions , or whether we will finally live up to the principle: \"Equal Justice Under Law.'There is no question that President Trump's misconduct has left a vacuum of leadership in our country, and the American people are looking to the United States Senate to demonstrate that their leaders are worthy of the public's trust. The American people should expect their representatives in the Senate to seek the truth, not cover up the facts.In that ongoing fight, we in the United States Senate must agree that we cannot speak about the ideals of equality and justice and then act in ways that violate those very principles. It is our duty both as senators and proud Americans to protect the Constitution, earn the people's trust, and prove to the American people that it is still within the power of the United States Congress to hold the president accountable.Full transcript of Harris' remarks: Just across the street from where I stand today sits the United States Supreme Court. That building has four words etched in marble above its entrance: \"Equal Justice Under Law.' The promise of those four words is that in our country, our system of justice must treat everyone equally, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, or socioeconomic status. But too many people in our country grow up knowing and experiencing that in America we have two systems of justice: one in which certain people are held accountable, and another in which powerful people like Donald Trump escape accountability altogether. This has been true from the first days of our nation's history, when a group of men gathered in Philadelphia to debate lofty notions of justice and equality, yet produced a document that literally counted Black Americans as fractions of a person. In the Declaration of Independence, we were told that \"All men are created equal' , but we know that in our nation's founding, at that time the policy of our nation was to rob indigenous people of their land and their livelihood and to exclude women from the right to vote. So, to make true the promise of America and move us toward that more perfect union, people have organized, fought, and marched for justice. From the suffragettes to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., those fights have won us progress towards a more just and inclusive nation. But clearly there is still more work to be done to achieve \"Equal Justice Under Law.' When the determination of whether you sit in jail before trial is too often based on the size of your bank account rather than the size of your crime, we have not yet achieved \"Equal Justice Under Law.' There is more work to be done when young people selling drugs on the corner too often become felons for life while white collar criminals face no accountability. There is more work to be done when regarding the sexual assault of women, the current president has said, \"When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.' There is work to be done when the American people know that the rules aren't equally enforced against powerful people. Unless we acknowledge these truths, too many Americans will remain distrustful of our institutions and cynical about our government and our leaders. And this is the point, my colleagues. We now face a choice: will we insist that we have one system of justice that applies equally to all? Or will we continue to have two systems of justice, in which some are above the law? Later this week, the Senate will likely begin the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. This moment in our history will have consequences. The Senate is charged with deciding whether the President of the United States, with all of his power and supposed wealth, will be held accountable for his actions , and whether we will finally live up to the principle: \"Equal Justice Under Law.' This is why I speak to you today, fully aware that I stand on the shoulders of those who came before me in our nation's ongoing fight for equality. I speak because I was raised by people who spent most of their lives demanding justice in the face of racism, misogyny, bigotry, and inequality. I speak because I have dedicated my entire career to upholding the rule of law and bringing integrity to our system of justice. I speak to ensure that everyone in California and throughout our country can enjoy the rights and freedoms guaranteed to them by the United States Constitution. And as a United States Senator, I speak fully prepared to uphold my solemn oath to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" and to \"do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws,\" and to affirm that my first obligation is to serve the people of the United States. All the people. I hope my colleagues can agree that our nation's founders had the foresight to create a system of checks and balances that anticipated the need to remove a president who might yield to foreign influence or use the presidency for personal power and benefit. Our founders feared that a day like this might come, and so they empowered the United States Congress with the tool of impeachment to hold a lawless president accountable. And so this week, after months of investigation, sworn testimony, public hearings, and debate, the House of Representatives will likely send to the United States Senate two articles of impeachment. These articles charge President Trump with abusing his power for his personal and political gain and with obstructing Congress's efforts to investigate his misconduct. In this trial, the United States Senate must not only consider the charges against the president, but also conduct itself in a way that demonstrates to the American people that in our system of justice, no one is above the law. Each senator must exhibit the kind of moral and ethical leadership that this president abandoned when he pressured a foreign nation to interfere in our elections. There is no question that President Trump's misconduct has left a vacuum of leadership in our country, and the American people are therefore looking to the United States Senate to demonstrate that their leaders are worthy of the public's trust. The American people should expect their senators to seek the truth, and not cover up the facts. So let us honor our oath to defend the Constitution by doing the job the American people have entrusted to us. Let us ensure that this trial is a search for truth and that we follow the facts where they lead and come to a verdict based on all of the available evidence. Let us do our jobs and insist that we hear from Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton, and anyone with firsthand knowledge of the president's misconduct. Let us demand that the White House turn over additional emails and documents that shed light on the president's motives for withholding military aid from Ukraine. And let us be clear, an order from this president to block evidence or witness testimony will itself be further evidence of his efforts to obstruct the United States Congress. The importance of this moment in our history cannot be overstated. What we do in this trial will show the world who we are as a country. Our answer will also send a message to future presidents of the United States about the kind of conduct that is acceptable from the leader of our nation. As the United States Senate, we must say that it's unacceptable for a president to shake down a vulnerable foreign nation for personal or political benefit. We must say, with one voice, that no president can disregard the legitimate oversight authority of the United States Congress. And we must say, as leaders of the United States of America, that in our system of justice everyone will be held accountable for their actions, including the president of the United States. And my final point: years from now, people are going to judge whether we rose to the solemn occasion that is the impeachment trial of the president of the United States. And we cannot be passive in this moment. I am mindful of Coretta Scott King's words that \"freedom is never really won, you earn it and win it with each generation.\" It is incumbent on this generation to fight for a system of justice in which all are treated equally. And in that ongoing fight, we in the United States Senate must agree that we cannot speak about the ideals of equality and justice and then act in ways that violate those very principles. It is our duty both as senators and as proud Americans to protect the Constitution, to earn the people's trust, and prove to the American people that it is still within power of the United States Congress to hold the president accountable. History is watching. Our actions here will shape this body's legacy. So I urge my colleagues to have the courage, the foresight, and the patriotism to act in the interest of our nation and its people. I urge my colleagues to fight for one system of justice in the United States of America and to ensure that no one is above the law. I urge my colleagues to reaffirm the most basic of American principles: that ours is not the government of one man, but a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1404704\/ahead-of-impeachment-trial-harris-delivers-speech-on-fight-for-the-integrity-of-the-american-system-of-justice&speechType=6","Summary":"Executive Branch Legislative Branch","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/ahead-of-impeachment-trial-harris-delivers-speech-on-fight-for-the-integrity-of-the-american-system-of-justice","CleanText":"Just across the street from where I stand today sits the United States Supreme Court.

Harris (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on Tuesday joined Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and 14 of their colleagues in introducing a resolution marking the third anniversary of President Trump's executive order barring immigrants from majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States, and calling on Congress to reaffirm the United States' commitment to providing a safe haven for refugees fleeing oppression including the tens of thousands of asylum seekers facing violence in Mexico under the administration's inhumane policies. Three years ago, President Trump issued the first of three executive orders banning refugees, immigrants, and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries to the United States. Since then, the Trump Administration has continued to pursue anti-immigrant, anti-refugee policies rooted in religious and nationality-based discrimination, with additional bans looming. \"The United States is and will always be a nation of immigrants, and our strength comes from our diversity,\" said Senator Harris. \"As the president continues to push his anti-immigrant agenda, we must recommit to our humanity as a nation, to our responsibility to welcome immigrants and refugees, and to our fight against religious and ethnic discrimination.\" As the global displacement crisis continues to worsen , with more than 25,400,000 refugees worldwide , the resolution directs the United States to commit to resettle a robust number of refugees to meet its share of the global need. The United States set a record low in refugee admissions for 2020 by allowing just 18,000 refugees. Along with Harris, Feinstein, and Blumenthal, the resolution is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Bernie Sanders (D-VT), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Chris Coons (D-DE). The full text of the resolution is copied below. Title: Recognizing January 27, 2020, as the anniversary of the first refugee and Muslim ban, calling on Congress to defund the Migrant Protection Protocols, and urging the President to restore refugee resettlement to historic norms. Whereas the world is in the midst of the worst global displacement crisis in history, with more than 25,900,000 refugees worldwide, according to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates; Whereas UNHCR reports that global resettlement needs have doubled in recent years, reaching over 1,440,000 refugees in 2020; Whereas the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) is a life-saving solution critical to global humanitarian efforts, which serves to strengthen global security, leverage United States foreign policy goals, and support regional host countries while serving individuals and families in need; Whereas the United States has been a global leader in responding to displacement crises around the world and promoting the safety, health, and well-being of refugees and displaced persons; Whereas refugees are the most vetted travelers to enter the United States and are subject to extensive screening checks, including in-person interviews, biometric data checks, and multiple interagency checks; Whereas the United States Government leverages resettlement to encourage other countries to keep their doors open to refugees, allow refugee children to attend school, and allow adults to work; Whereas the USRAP emphasizes early self-sufficiency through employment, and most adult refugees are employed within their first six months of arriving to the United States; Whereas refugees contribute to their communities by starting businesses, paying taxes, sharing their cultural traditions, and being involved in their neighborhoods, and reports have found that refugees contribute more than they consume in State-funded services, including for schooling and health care; Whereas, for over 40 years, the United States has resettled up to 200,000 refugees per year, with an average admissions goal of 95,000 refugees per year; Whereas the United States Government has abdicated its leadership by setting a record-low refugee admissions goal in fiscal year 2020 at 18,000; Whereas, on January 27, 2017, President Donald J. Trump released an executive order banning individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees from entering the country; Whereas, since that time, the President has taken further executive and administrative actions to ban people from Muslim-majority countries and to dismantle the United States refugee program, resulting in significantly lowered capacity and loss of institutional memory and experience in the historically successful USRAP; Whereas the President issued a Proclamation on November 9, 2018, that wrongfully and illegally blocks people who cross between ports of entry from applying for asylum, and since then has taken further aggressive steps to dismantle the United States asylum system; Whereas the Department of Homeland Security started implementation of the Migrant Protection Protocols on January 29, 2019, and it has exposed tens of thousands of asylum seekers to torture, kidnapping, trafficking, and exploitation by returning them to dangerous border cities in Mexico; Whereas the 2018 Department of State country report for Mexico acknowledges serious and targeted risks faced by migrants and asylum seekers in, and transiting through, Mexico, such that it remains an unsafe place for many; Whereas the United States has returned more than 24,000 asylum seekers alone to Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros, widely recognized as among the most violent cities in the world, located in the state of Tamaulipas, which is the subject of a Department of State \"Level 4: Do Not Travel\" advisory; Whereas sending asylum seekers to another country limits and may completely eliminate their opportunity to identify and meet with counsel, thereby lowering their chances of obtaining relief; and Whereas all individuals seeking asylum in the United States are entitled to due process and access to an attorney: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate, (1) reaffirms the United States' proud history of refugee resettlement and protection of asylum seekers; (2) recognizes January 27, 2020, as the anniversary of the first refugee and Muslim ban; (3) reaffirms the strong bipartisan commitment of the United States to promote the safety, health, and well-being of refugees, including through resettlement and the asylum seeking process to the United States for those who cannot return home; (4) underscores the importance of the United States Refugee Admissions Program and a robust asylum system as critical tools for United States global leadership; (5) recognizes the profound consequences faced by refugees, asylum seekers, and their families who have been stranded, separated, and scarred by current United States policies, leaving thousands mid-process and more with little hope of protection in the United States; and (6) calls upon the United States Government, (A) to resettle a robust number of refugees to meet global need in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 with an emphasis on rebuilding the resettlement program and returning to historic norms; (B) to operate the program in good faith in an attempt to meet their own stated objectives, restore historic refugee arrivals, improve consultation with Congress, and adhere to the clear congressional intent within the Refugee Act of 1980 (Public Law 96, 212); (C) to ensure that no funds be made available by any Act to implement or enforce the Migrant Protection Protocols announced by the Secretary of Homeland Security on December 20, 2018, or any subsequent revisions to those protocols; (D) to enact the National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act, introduced in the Senate as S.1123 (116th Congress) and in the House of Representatives as H.R.2214 (116th Congress), which would terminate the Muslim, refugee, and asylum bans; and (E) to recommit to offering freedom to individuals fleeing from persecution and oppression regardless of their country of origin or religious beliefs.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1404730\/harris-feinstein-colleagues-call-for-a-national-commitment-to-refugee-resettlement-on-third-anniversary-of-trumps-travel-ban&speechType=6","Summary":"National Security Foreign Affairs Immigration","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-feinstein-colleagues-call-for-a-national-commitment-to-refugee-resettlement-on-third-anniversary-of-trumps-travel-ban","CleanText":"The United States is and will always be a nation of immigrants, and our strength comes from our diversity.

At first they proposed that we would have two days and then their constituents said \"well that's ridiculous,\" so they extended it to three as though they were being very gracious. But they have always been focused on their end game , our Republican Senate , and the end game for them has been acquittal, but here's the deal, you cannot have a true acquittal if you have not had a fair trial. So, they are not going to get what they've been trying to get if they do not allow witnesses to come forward. This is not a fair trial. The American people , the vast majority of the American public , want this United States Senate to produce the new evidence. The only place this is being debated between Republicans and Democrats is not among the American people , it is here in the United States Senate. The American people , Republicans and Democrats , the vast majority believe that the new evidence should come forward.

The most serious concern our framers and founders had is there would be foreign entanglement, foreign entanglement in our government, in our democracy, in our republic, in our elections. And that is the basis of Article 1 of the impeachment of Donald Trump. Is it not right if we are going to honor our oath much less these fancy lapel pins that everybody walks around here wearing? That we would fight for the integrity of this process, and that we would receive evidence that we know is available. So the bottom line is that at the end of this they will probably get what they want.

Because the true power and potential of the United States of America resides not with the president, but with the people. All the people.Full transcript of Harris' remarks below: Mr. President, when the framers wrote the Constitution they didn't think someone like me would serve as a United States Senator. But they did envision someone like Donald Trump being president of the United States. Someone who thinks that he is above the law and that the rules don't apply to him. So, they made sure our democracy had the tool of impeachment to stop that kind of abuse of power. The House managers have clearly laid out a compelling case and evidence of Donald Trump's misconduct. They have shown that the president of the United States of America withheld military aid and a coveted White House meeting for his political gain. He wanted a foreign country to announce , not actually conduct , announce an investigation into his political rivals. And then he refused to comply with congressional investigations into his misconduct. And, unfortunately, a majority of United States Senators , even those who concede that what Donald Trump did was wrong , are nonetheless going to refuse to hold him accountable. The Senate trial of Donald Trump has been a miscarriage of justice. Donald Trump is going to get away with abusing his position of power for personal gain, abusing his position of power to stop Congress from looking into his misconduct, and falsely claiming he's been exonerated. He's going to escape accountability because a majority of senators have decided to let him. They voted repeatedly to block key evidence like witnesses and documents that could have shed light on the full truth. And we must recognize that still in America, there are two systems of justice , one for the powerful and another for everyone else. So let's speak the truth about what our two systems of justice actually mean in the real world. It means that in our country too many people walk into courthouses and face systemic bias. Too often they lack adequate legal representation , whether they are overworked, underpaid or both It means that a young man named Emmett Till was falsely accused and then murdered, but his murderer didn't have to spend a day in jail. It means that four young Black men had their lives taken or turned upside down after being falsely accused of a crime in Groveland, Florida. It means that right now, too many people in America, are sitting in jail without having yet been convicted of a crime but simply because they cannot afford bail. And it means that future presidents of the United States will remember that the United States Senate failed to hold Donald Trump accountable, and they will be emboldened to abuse their power knowing there will be no consequence. Donald Trump knows all this better than anybody. He may not acknowledge that we have two systems of justice, but he knows the institutions in this country , be it the courts or the Senate , are set up to protect powerful people like him. He told us as much, when regarding the sexual assault of women, he said, \"When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\" He said that Article II of the United States Constitution gives him as president the right to do whatever he wants. Trump has shown us through his words and actions that he thinks he is above the law. And when the American people see the president acting as though he is above the law, it understandably leaves them feeling un-trustful of our system of justice, distrustful of our democracy. When the United States Senate refuses to hold him accountable, it reinforces that loss of trust in our system. Now, I'm under no illusion that this body is poised to hold this president accountable. But despite the conduct of the United States Senate in this impeachment trial, the American people must continue to strive toward the more perfect union that our Constitution promises. And it's going to take all of us, in every state, every town, everywhere to continue fighting for the best of who we are as a country. We each have an important role to play in fighting for those words inscribed on that United States Supreme Court: \"Equal Justice Under Law.\" Frederick Douglass, who like many, I consider to be one of the founders of our nation, wrote that, \"the whole history of the progress of human liberty that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle.\" The impeachment of Donald Trump has been one of those earnest struggles for liberty. In this fight, like so many before, it has been a fight against tyranny. This struggle has not been an easy one and it has left too many people across our nation feeling cynical. For too many people, this trial confirms something they've always known: that the real power in this country lies not with them, but with just a few people who advance their own interests at the expense of others' needs. For many, the injustice in this trial is yet another example of the way that our system of justice has worked, or, more accurately, failed to work. But here's the thing. Frederick Douglass also told us that, \"if there is no struggle, there is no progress.\" He went on to say, \"Power concedes nothing without a demand.\" And he said, \"It never did and it never will.\" In order to wrestle power away from the few people at the very top who abuse their power, the American people are going to have to fight for the voice of the people and the power of the people. We must go into the darkness to shine a light, and we cannot be deterred, and we cannot be overwhelmed, and we cannot ever give up on our country. We cannot ever give up on the ideals that are the foundation for our system of democracy. We can never give up on the meaning of true justice, and it is part of our history, our past, clearly our present, and our future that in order to make these values real, in order to make the promise of our country real, we can never take it for granted. There will be moments in time and history where we experience incredible disappointment, but the greatest disappointment of all will be if we give up. We cannot ever give up fighting for who we know we are, and we must always see who we can be unburdened by who we have been. That is the strength of our nation. So, after the Senate votes today, Donald Trump will want the American people to feel cynical. He will want us not to care. He will want us to think that he is all powerful, and we have no power. But we're not going to let him get away with that. We're not going to give him what he wants. Because the true power and potential of the United States of America resides not with the president, but with the people. All the people. So in our long struggle for justice, I will do my part by voting to convict this lawless president and remove him from office. And I urge my colleagues to join me on the right side of history.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1405384\/harris-the-senate-trial-of-donald-trump-has-been-a-miscarriage-of-justice&speechType=6","Summary":"Executive Branch Legislative Branch","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-the-senate-trial-of-donald-trump-has-been-a-miscarriage-of-justice","CleanText":"Mr. President, when the framers wrote the Constitution they didn't think someone like me would serve as a United States Senator.

When the United States Senate refuses to hold him accountable, it reinforces that loss of trust in our system. Now, I'm under no illusion that this body is poised to hold this president accountable. But despite the conduct of the United States Senate in this impeachment trial, the American people must continue to strive toward the more perfect union that our Constitution promises. And it's going to take all of us, in every state, every town, everywhere to continue fighting for the best of who we are as a country. We each have an important role to play in fighting for those words inscribed on that United States Supreme Court: 'Equal Justice Under Law.' Frederick Douglass, who like many, I consider to be one of the founders of our nation, wrote that, 'the whole history of the progress of human liberty that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle.' The impeachment of Donald Trump has been one of those earnest struggles for liberty. In this fight, like so many before, it has been a fight against tyranny. This struggle has not been an easy one and it has left too many people across our nation feeling cynical. For too many people, this trial confirms something they've always known: that the real power in this country lies not with them, but with just a few people who advance their own interests at the expense of others' needs. For many, the injustice in this trial is yet another example of the way that our system of justice has worked, or, more accurately, failed to work. But here's the thing. Frederick Douglass also told us that, 'if there is no struggle, there is no progress.' He went on to say, 'Power concedes nothing without a demand.' And he said, 'It never did and it never will.' In order to wrestle power away from the few people at the very top who abuse their power, the American people are going to have to fight for the voice of the people and the power of the people. We must go into the darkness to shine a light, and we cannot be deterred, and we cannot be overwhelmed, and we cannot ever give up on our country. We cannot ever give up on the ideals that are the foundation for our system of democracy. We can never give up on the meaning of true justice, and it is part of our history, our past, clearly our present, and our future that in order to make these values real, in order to make the promise of our country real, we can never take it for granted. There will be moments in time and history where we experience incredible disappointment, but the greatest disappointment of all will be if we give up. We cannot ever give up fighting for who we know we are, and we must always see who we can be unburdened by who we have been. That is the strength of our nation. So, after the Senate votes today, Donald Trump will want the American people to feel cynical. He will want us not to care. He will want us to think that he is all powerful, and we have no power. But we're not going to let him get away with that. We're not going to give him what he wants. Because the true power and potential of the United States of America resides not with the president, but with the people. All the people. So in our long struggle for justice, I will do my part by voting to convict this lawless president and remove him from office. And I urge my colleagues to join me on the right side of history."}

Harris (D-CA) joined Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and 8 of their colleagues in introducing the Allowing Steady Savings by Eliminating Tests, or ASSET, Act to eliminate asset limits as a means of eligibility for three vital public assistance programs and raise asset limits for a fourth program. The bill presents an alternative vision for vital public assistance programs. Rather than shredding the safety net by imposing new bureaucratic hurdles for families, as proposed by President Trump in his budget released this week, the ASSET Act would increase the financial security of low-income families by helping them save for the future and move towards self-sufficiency. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) help low-income families, particularly those with children, meet basic needs like food and heating. However, currently, these public assistance programs limit eligibility for benefits on the basis of not only income, but the assets of a family, such as savings and other resources. Asset limits for savings are outdated and often set as low as $1,000 or $2,000, limiting a family's preparedness for a medical emergency or unanticipated expense. The ASSET Act would eliminate these savings penalties, reducing administrative costs and resulting in a consistent policy across the country. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program reduces extreme poverty among the elderly and people with disabilities. While asset limits are part of the SSI program design, limits have not been raised or even adjusted for inflation since 1989. The ASSET Act raises SSI asset limits from $2,000 to $10,000 for an individual and $3,000 to $20,000 for a couple, and indexes those thresholds to inflation. \"Let's be clear, safety net programs should not punish people for saving money for unexpected expenses and medical emergencies,\" said Senator Harris. \"I'm proud to join my colleagues in introducing legislation that helps lift working families out of poverty by eliminating outdated restrictions. We should be doing everything we can to ensure Americans have access to these vital programs that help them thrive.\" In addition to Senators Harris, Coons, and Brown, the ASSET Act is cosponsored by Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Bob Casey (D-PA).

Harris (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) joined Senators Tom Udall (D-NM) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) in unveiling the Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2020, legislation that would phase out unnecessary single-use plastic products, hold corporations accountable for wasteful products, reduce wasteful packaging, and reform our broken waste and recycling collection system. Recent reports estimate that each person consumes a credit card's worth of plastic per week. That's because plastic is everywhere and it doesn't biodegrade. Plastic breaks down into micro-plastics that are found in rainwater on the peaks of the Rocky Mountains, in farmland soil that produces our food, and in our lakes, rivers, and seas. Plastic production is also a major contributor to climate change, with its production expected to account for 20 percent of global oil consumption by 2050. Meanwhile, 92 percent of U.S. plastic waste is never recycled. By shifting the responsibility for recycling and cleanup to the companies that produce wasteful products, practical waste reduction and waste management policies can reverse this trend and put the United States on a path to break free from plastic pollution. \"There is simply no question we are facing a global environmental crisis from plastic pollution,\" said Senator Harris. \"The Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act offers comprehensive action to reduce plastic waste and production, one of the major contributors to climate change and the poisoning of our oceans and waterways. California has been a leader on this issue and it is vital that we implement long lasting solutions at the federal level and hold corporations accountable for the plastic waste and pollution that poison our families and environment.\" Along with Harris, Feinstein, Udall and Merkely the legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). The legislation joins initiatives from a number of countries around the world to reduce plastic pollution, such as policies from the 28 member countries of the European Union, Canada, India and China. The Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act will provide badly-needed national leadership , reducing the amount of wasteful plastic and reforming our broken waste and recycling collection system. It will shift the burden of cleanup to where it belongs , to the corporations that produce this waste: Require big corporations take responsibility for their pollution, requiring producers of plastic products to design, manage, and finance waste and recycling programs.Spur innovation, incentivizing big corporations to make reusable products and items that can actually be recycled.Create a nationwide beverage container refund program, which is successful at the state level.Reduce and ban certain single-use plastic products that are not recyclable.Establish minimum recycled content requirements for beverage containers, packaging, and food-service products, while standardizing recycling and composting labeling.Spur massive investments in U.S. domestic recycling and composting infrastructure, while pressing pause on new plastic facilities until critical environment and health protections are put in place.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1405400\/harris-feinstein-lawmakers-unveil-landmark-legislation-to-break-free-from-plastic-pollution&speechType=6","Summary":"Environment","Source":null,"Location":"Washington D.C.","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-feinstein-lawmakers-unveil-landmark-legislation-to-break-free-from-plastic-pollution","CleanText":"There is simply no question we are facing a global environmental crisis from plastic pollution.

The bill introduction comes after the House of Representatives passed a large western public lands package that included the same increased protections for California lands. \"Every American should have the ability to explore and enjoy the outdoors, especially throughout California's beautiful natural scenery,\" said Harris. \"But this administration has threatened and chipped away at protections for our public lands, undermining our right to clear water and clean air.

The PUBLIC Lands Act is a single bill that contains the three previously introduced bills. Harris has also led the fight for increasing access to the outdoors for underserved communities in our cities by introducing the Outdoors for All Act with Representative Barragan (CA-44). In 2018, her bill to expand the John Muir National Historic Site in Martinez, CA was signed into law. In 2019, her legislation to establish a national monument at the site of the St. Francis Dam disaster and to preserve and improve historic buildings and sites at Historically Black College and Universities was signed into law as part of the Natural Resources Management Act.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1405406\/harris-feinstein-applaud-house-passage-of-public-lands-bill-and-introduce-senate-companion-package&speechType=6","Summary":"Environment","Source":null,"Location":"Washington D.C.","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-feinstein-applaud-house-passage-of-public-lands-bill-and-introduce-senate-companion-package","CleanText":"Every American should have the ability to explore and enjoy the outdoors, especially throughout California's beautiful natural scenery.

The Gun Records Restoration and Preservation Act would require the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) to collect, preserve and disclose gun records and gun tracing data. \"There is a national epidemic of gun violence; Congress needs to act,\" said Sen. Harris. \"Access to gun data is vital to law enforcement's ability to solve gun crimes and keep our communities safe.

Harris (D-CA) on Friday joined Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Representative Lloyd Doggett (D-TX) in unveiling legislation to repeal a massive tax giveaway for a small group of wealthy taxpayers that Republicans included in the coronavirus relief bill. The legislation would do away with provisions in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act that the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates will reduce government revenue by $195 billion over ten years, and that would overwhelmingly benefit wealthy taxpayers like hedge fund managers and real estate speculators. Together, the Republican provisions are among the costliest parts of the CARES Act, despite having no real connection to battling coronavirus or its economic fallout. \"It's outrageous that Senate Republicans gave the richest individuals in our nation a tax break in COVID-19 relief bill,\" said Senator Harris. \"We need to be protecting the most vulnerable communities during this time, not giving away money to the rich. This is provision must be repealed immediately.\" Joining Harris and Whitehouse on the bill in the Senate is Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), along with Senators Tom Carper (D-DE), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Tom Udall (D-NM), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Jeff Markey (D-OR), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Angus King (I-ME), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chris Coons (D-DE), Jack Reed (D-RI), Chris Murphy (D-CT), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). Joining Doggett on the bill in the House are Representatives Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Jamie Raskin (D-MD), and Steve Cohen (D-TN), along with nearly 40 other House members. The Republican provisions, sections 2303 and 2304 of the CARES Act, allow wealthy taxpayers to use losses in certain years to avoid paying taxes in other years. Among other things, the changes allowed wealthy taxpayers to claim rich refund checks for the 2018 and 2019 tax years , before the coronavirus crisis hit. And unlike programs in the CARES Act that required employers use benefits to maintain payroll and support workers, sections 2303 and 2304 let wealthy taxpayers keep the benefits with no strings attached. Only after the Senate had already voted on the CARES Act did the full cost of the Republican provisions become clear. According to an analysis from the JCT, just 43,000 individual tax filers covered by one of the Republican provisions would see their tax liability fall by a combined $70.3 billion in 2020. Nearly 82 percent of those who will benefit from that provision make $1 million or more, with 95 percent making over $200,000. The tax benefits from the Republican provisions dwarf payments flowing to working Americans. Based on the JCT's analysis, millionaire tax filers benefiting from one of the provisions will see an average benefit of $1.6 million this year alone. In contrast, direct payments to most Americans under the CARES Act are capped at $1,200. The bill would repeal the Republican provisions and, in their place, add a provision designed to help small companies struggling to stay afloat. This provision would be available to companies with under $15 million in receipts that have not engaged in excessive executive compensation, dividends, or stock buybacks. Unlike the Republican provisions, the new provision would only apply to 2020 and would offer taxpayers advanced refunds of up to $100,000 now to give them cash when they need it. According to reports, beneficiaries of the tax giveaways may include President Trump, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and \"real estate investors in President Trump's inner circle.\"","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1420507\/harris-colleagues-unveil-bill-to-repeal-gop-tax-giveaway-to-million-dollar-plus-earners-in-coronavirus-relief-legislation&speechType=6","Summary":"Taxes","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.harris.senate.gov\/news\/press-releases\/harris-colleagues-unveil-bill-to-repeal-gop-tax-giveaway-to-million-dollar-plus-earners-in-coronavirus-relief-legislation_","CleanText":"It's outrageous that Senate Republicans gave the richest individuals in our nation a tax break in COVID-19 relief bill.

Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday joined Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and Tom Udall (D-N.M.) in introducing theImpact Aid Infrastructure Act (IAIA), which provides $1 billion in supplemental funding for school infrastructure construction grants through the Impact Aid program. Similar legislation was introduced in the House last year. IAIA provides competitive and formula grants for school infrastructure projects, including school construction and facilities upgrades, in school districts with high percentages of children with military parents or children living on Indian lands. With these grants, school districts would have the flexibility to focus on their specific renovation and repair needs, which could include changes to help protect the health, safety, and well-being of students, teachers, school leaders, and school personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect communities in California and across the nation, school districts need our support. We must ensure all schools have the resources they need to provide safe and healthy learning environments for their students. I'm proud to join my colleagues in introducing the Impact Aid Infrastructure Act to give federally impacted school districts the assistance they need to continue to serve our communities during this public health emergency and beyond,\" Senator Harris said. \"As schools in Hawaii prepare to open in the coming weeks following coronavirus-related delays, it is essential they have the expanded tools to protect students, their families, and staff. This bill would increase critical funding to help school districts across the country meet their specific infrastructure needs, so that every child, regardless of where they live, receives a quality education in a healthy and safe learning environment,\" Senator Hirono said. \"I will continue to advocate for federal resources to support our nation's schools, including through long-term investments in school infrastructure that keep students safe.\" \"Even before the pandemic, many federally impacted school districts were in need of significant repair and renovation to provide a safe learning environment , now, they must be able to accommodate remote learning and public health guidelines to protect the health of students, teachers, and staff,\" said Senator Gillibrand. \"The Impact Aid Infrastructure Act is critical legislation to ensure these school districts can address the unique needs presented by this crisis and make the necessary repairs and renovations to ensure students, teachers, and staff have safe learning and working environments. I'm proud to lead this legislation with Senator Hirono and I will continue working to include this desperately needed funding in the next relief package so that schools on or near military communities, Federal or Tribal Lands in New York and across the country have the resources needed to provide every student with a quality education.\" \"As schools in Minnesota and across the country prepare for a new school year, they are facing unprecedented challenges in preparing a safe school environment for students, teachers and support staff,\" said Senator Smith. \"Even prior to the pandemic, many Impact Aid schools already had significant infrastructure needs. These grants would allow them to address infrastructure needs that are critically important to helping students learn and helping teachers teach.\" \"As we continue to confront this pandemic, it's important to ensure that school districts can provide a quality education to their students - even those schools without the ability to fund their operations through property taxes,\" Senator Klobuchar said. \"This legislation will help ensure that even during these challenging times, local school districts in Minnesota on federal land can retain the teachers, technology, and transportation they need to help students succeed.\" \"By addressing the backlog of Impact Aid projects, we can help federally impacted school districts in New Mexico repair or rebuild decades-old infrastructures,\" said Senator Heinrich. \"That is why I am proud to help introduce legislation that ensures these school districts have access to critical infrastructure funding so that we can improve the quality of education for all of our students.\" \"The infrastructure and facilities needs in federally impacted school districts, which educate some of our nation's most vulnerable children, are well documented , as is their disadvantage in raising funds for capital projects due to the presence of federal property,\" said NAFIS Executive Director Hilary Goldmann. \"The Impact Aid Construction program has been underfunded for years. Particularly as these districts reopen school buildings in the context of COVID-19, they need additional resources to ensure school facilities are safe for students and staff to learn and work.

Harris (D-CA), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Monday released the following statement on her vote against the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States: \"Senate Republicans jammed through this nomination in the middle of an election where over 60 million Americans have already voted. Senate Republicans have ignored the will of the people, deciding instead to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , who devoted her life to fighting for equal justice , with someone who was selected to undo her legacy. \"President Trump repeatedly made clear that he would only nominate judges who would get rid of the Affordable Care Act. President Trump and Senate Republicans are determined to take away health care coverage and protections for people with preexisting conditions. On November 10, Trump administration lawyers will be before the Supreme Court arguing to strike down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. This is a big reason why Senate Republicans rushed this confirmation. If they succeed, millions of people will lose access to health care in the middle of a devastating pandemic that has killed over 225,000 Americans and sickened millions more. \"The American people see this confirmation for what it is: an illegitimate move that will set our country back for generations. Access to health care is now in jeopardy. Our voting rights are now in jeopardy. Workers' rights are now in jeopardy. LGBTQ equality is now in jeopardy. The right to a safe and legal abortion is now in jeopardy. The ability to address a changing climate is now in jeopardy.
