He will: Support our educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve.Invest in resources for our schools so students grow into physically and emotionally healthy adults, and educators can focus on teaching.Ensure that no child's future is determined by their zip code, parents' income, race, or disability.Provide every middle and high school student a path to a successful career.Start investing in our children at birth.PROVIDING EDUCATORS THE SUPPORT AND RESPECT THEY NEED AND DESERVE. Educators deserve a partner in the White House. With President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, they'll get two. Dr. Biden has worked as an educator for more than 30 years. She and Joe understand that, for educators, their profession isn't just what they do; it is who they are. Educators , teachers, teachers' aides, and everyone who supports our kids at school, from the bus drivers to the secretaries to the school nurses , answer a call to service. They help our children learn and grow into successful adults. For so many young people, knowing they have a teacher and school community believing in and fighting for them can make all the difference. But while educating is rewarding, it is also challenging. Many educators across the country are experiencing stagnant wages, slashed benefits, growing class sizes, and fewer resources for their students. Too many teachers have to work second jobs to make ends meet for their families. And, far too often, teachers and school personnel have to take on additional responsibilities that go far beyond the classroom. Educators end up spending their own money on school supplies, mentoring and coaching new teachers, trying to fill in as social workers, and so much more. Teachers should be supported with resources and shouldn't have to take on all of these responsibilities on their own. We have witnessed educators around the country , in states from West Virginia to Arizona to Kentucky , heroically organize walk-outs and other actions to stand up not just for their own wages and benefits, but also for the resources they need to serve their students. Educators shouldn't have to fight so hard for resources and respect. President Biden will support our educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve. Make sure teachers receive a competitive wage and benefits. In 2018, public school teachers made 21.4 percent less than workers with similar education and experience. And public school teachers' average weekly wage hasn't increased since 1996. Teachers and school personnel do some of the most important and hardest work, but too often they aren't rewarded. As President, Biden will correct this wrong. Biden will triple funding for Title I, the federal program funding schools with a high percentage of students from low-income families, and require districts to use these funds to offer educators competitive salaries and make other critical investments prior to directing the funds to other purposes. Dramatically increasing Title I funding in order to give teachers a raise will allow school districts and educators to decide what the biggest need is for their communities instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach. And, it will ensure that states which have been treating their teachers fairly but still have unmet needs for Title I schools can benefit from these funds.Invest in teacher mentoring, leadership, and additional education. We need more opportunities for highly effective teachers to remain in the classroom and advance in their careers. The Biden Administration will help school districts create opportunities for teachers to lead beyond the classroom. Teachers will be able to serve as mentors and coaches to other teachers and as leaders of professional learning communities, and will be compensated for that additional work they take on. These funds will also be used to help teachers who choose to earn an additional certification in a high-demand area , like special education or bilingual education , while they are still teaching do so without accumulating debt.Help teachers and other educators pay off their student loans. Teachers shouldn't have to worry about how they are going to make their student loan payments while they are busy educating the next generation. Biden will see to it that the existing Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program is fixed, simplified, and actually helps teachers.President Biden will invest in resources for our schools so students grow into physically and emotionally healthy adults, and educators can focus on teaching. Double the number of psychologists, counselors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals in our schools so our kids get the mental health care they need. One in five children in the U.S. experience mental health problems. Yet, too many of our children are not getting the mental health care they need from a trained professional. We need mental health professionals in our schools to help provide quality mental health care, but we don't have nearly enough. The current school psychologist to student ratio in this country is roughly 1,400 to 1, while experts say it should be at most 700 to 1. That's a gap of about 35,000 to 60,000 school psychologists. Teachers too often end up having to fill the gap, taking away from their time focusing on teaching. President Biden will make an unprecedented investment in school mental health professionals in order to double the number of psychologists, counselors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals employed in our schools, and partner with colleges to expand the pipeline of these professionals.Bring needed support for students and parents into our public schools. When parents are working hard to make ends meet, it can be difficult, if not impossible, for them to navigate various family needs like after-school care, health and social services, and adult education courses. When students are habitually sick because they don't have access to preventive care, or can't see the board at the front of the room because they haven't been to the eye doctor, learning becomes exponentially more difficult. But in many neighborhoods, educators, parents, and community members have come up with a solution: community schools. Community schools work with families, students, teachers and community organizations to identify families' unmet needs and then develop a plan to leverage community resources to address these needs in the school building, turning schools into community hubs. Biden will expand this model, providing this wraparound support for an additional 300,000 students and their families.Make sure teachers and students can work and learn in safe and healthy environments. Public school facilities received a grade of D+ from the American Society of Civil Engineers. In fact, each year the U.S. underfunds school infrastructure by $46 billion, resulting in thousands of schools that are outdated, unsafe, unfit, and , in some cases , making kids and educators sick. President Biden will include in federal infrastructure legislation funding specifically for improving public school buildings. First and foremost, these funds will be used to address health risks. Additional funds will be used to build cutting-edge, energy-efficient, innovative schools with technology and labs to prepare our students for the jobs of the future.Defeat the National Rifle Association , again , in order to make our schools safer. Parents shouldn't have to worry about whether their kids will come home from school, and students shouldn't have to sacrifice themselves for their friends days before graduation. We cannot let gun violence become an acceptable part of American life. Biden knows that arming teachers isn't the answer; instead, we need rational gun laws. As President, he will secure passage of gun legislation to make our students safer, and he knows he can do it because he's defeated the National Rifle Association twice before. He'll begin by again championing legislation to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines , bans he authored in 1994 , and require universal background checks to keep guns out of dangerous hands. And, he'll invest in healing the trauma that impacts survivors of gun violence and their communities.

In order to maintain our competitiveness, our current system of kindergarten through 12th grade education is essential but no longer sufficient. Roughly 6 out of 10 jobs in the United States require education beyond a high school diploma. And, too many parents don't have access to the resources and support they need to support and ensure their children are developing healthily. As a result, there's an achievement gap in this country before our children even enter kindergarten. As President, Biden will build an education system that starts investing in our children at birth and helps every student get some education beyond a high school diploma, whether a certification, associate's degree, or bachelor's degree. Systemic racism is persistent across our institutions today , including in our schools , and must be addressed. President Biden will make sure that no child's education opportunity is determined by their zip code, parents' income, race, or disability. President Biden will ensure that no child's future is determined by their zip code, parents' income, race, or disability. Invest in our schools to eliminate the funding gap between white and non-white districts, and rich and poor districts. There's an estimated $23 billion annual funding gap between white and non-white school districts today, and gaps persist between high- and low-income districts as well. Biden will work to close this gap by nearly tripling Title I funding, which goes to schools serving a high number of children from low-income families. This new funding will first be used to ensure teachers at Title I schools are paid competitively, three- and four-year-olds have access to pre-school, and districts provide access to rigorous coursework across all their schools, not just a few. Once these conditions are met, districts will have the flexibility to use these funds to meet other local priorities. States without a sufficient and equitable finance system will be required to match a share of federal funds.Improve teacher diversity. Research shows us the substantial and unique impact that teachers of color have on students of color. For example, for black students, having just one black teacher in elementary school reduces the probability of dropping out. Biden will support more innovative approaches to recruiting teachers of color, including supporting high school students in accessing dual-enrollment classes that give them an edge in teacher preparation programs, helping paraprofessionals work towards their teaching certificate, and working with historically black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions to recruit and prepare teachers.Build the best, most innovative schools in the country in low-income communities and communities of color. Preparing our students for the workforce increasingly entails not only rigorous academics, but also problem-solving, collaboration, and technical skills. Biden will create a new competitive program challenging local communities to reinvent high school to meet these changing demands of work. This funding will be targeted first toward building the best schools in the country in low-income communities and communities of color.Reinstate the Obama-Biden Administration's actions to diversify our schools. As President, Biden will reinstate Department of Education guidance that supported schools in legally pursuing desegregation strategies and recognized institutions of higher education's interests in creating diverse student bodies. And, he will provide grants to school districts to create plans and implement strategies to diversify their schools.Make sure children with disabilities have the support to succeed. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, signed into law in 1990, promised to provide 40% of the extra cost of special education required by the bill. Currently, the federal government only covers roughly 14% of this cost, failing to live up to our commitment. The Biden Administration will fully fund this obligation within ten years. We must ensure that children with disabilities get the education and training they need to succeed.President Biden will provide every middle and high school student a path to a successful career. Ensure middle and high schools prepare students for good jobs. Students who participate in high-quality career and technical education are more likely to graduate, earn industry credentials, enroll in college, and have higher rates of employment and higher earnings. Like the arts and music, vocational training can often engage students in school, encourage pride for creativity and making, and teach entrepreneurial skills. Yet, American high schools have largely given up on \"shop classes\" in order to meet measures of accountability. The Biden Administration will invest in school vocational training and partnerships between high schools, community colleges, and employers. These partnerships will create programs that allow students to earn an industry credential upon high school graduation, a credential that readies them for a good-paying career. Career and technical education can also be used to increase access to middle- and high- school courses in computer science so that students learn computational thinking and are prepared to lead in fields such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence.Create more opportunities for high school students to take practical classes that lead to credentials. Biden will invest in and allow Pell grants to be used for dual enrollment programs, so high school students can take classes at a community college and earn college credits or a credential prior to graduating from high school.President Biden will start investing in our children at birth. Provide high-quality, universal pre-kindergarten for all three- and four -year-olds. For families with young children, finding highly quality pre-K is a major financial, logistical, and emotional burden, with potentially life-long consequences for their children. As President, Biden will work with states to offer pre-K for all three- and four-year-olds. This investment will ease the burden on our families, help close the achievement gap, promote the labor participation of parents who want to work, and lift our critical early childhood education workforce out of poverty.Provide early childhood development support to families where they are most likely to access it , the pediatrician's office. For many families with young children, the pediatrician's office is the one place where they interact with service providers before their child enters school. President Biden will provide funds to ensure that there is an early childhood development expert in every community health center. He will also provide grants to help cities place early childhood development experts in other pediatrician offices with a high percentage of Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program patients. These experts, as part of the primary care team, will help identify whether children are reaching development milestones, help connect families to additional services like home visiting when needed, and answer parents' questions regarding child development so every child in the U.S. is placed on the path to succeed once they start kindergarten.Expand home visiting. Through the Affordable Care Act, President Obama and Vice President Biden funded voluntary home visiting programs, under which health and child development specialists make consistent, scheduled visits to help parents through the critical early stage of parenting. Families may receive coaching on preventive health and prenatal practices, learn how to care for their babies and about important child development milestones and behaviors, receive breastfeeding support, get connected to employment and child care, and receive general support in navigating the often-stressful early stages of parenthood. Home visiting has been found to improve school readiness, maternal, and child health, and reduce child maltreatment. President Biden will double funding for home visiting so more families benefit from this program every year.Sound good to you?

It's a list that dates back more than 400 years: black men, black women, black children. The original sin of this country still stains our nation today. Sometimes we manage to overlook it, and just push forward with the thousand other tasks of daily life. But it's always there. And weeks like this, we see it plainly. We are a country with an open wound. None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words , \"I can't breathe\" , and do nothing. We cannot fall victim to what Martin Luther King called the \"appalling silence of the good people.\" Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering , who will be next? Imagine if every time your husband or son, wife or daughter, left the house, you feared for their safety from bad actors and bad police. Imagine if you had to have that talk with your child about not asserting their rights , and taking the abuse handed out to them , just so they could make it home. Imagine having the police called on you , for just sitting in Starbucks or renting an Airbnb or watching birds. That is the norm for black people in this nation , they don't have to imagine it. The anger and the frustration and the exhaustion , it's undeniable. But that is not the promise of America. And it is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all people. This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism. It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation. We need justice for George Floyd. We need real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet , that holds bad cops accountable, and that repairs the relationship between law enforcement and the community they are sworn to protect. And we need to stand up as a nation , with the black community, and with all minority communities , and come together as one America. That's the challenge we face. And it will require those of us who sit in positions of influence to finally deal with the abuse of power. The pain is too immense for one community to bear alone. It is the duty of every American to grapple with it , and grapple with it now. With our complacency, our silence , we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence. Nothing about this will be easy or comfortable. But if we simply allow this wound to scab over once more, without treating the underlying injury , we will never truly heal. The very soul of America is at stake. We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. We have to pursue it with real urgency. We have to make real the American promise, which we have never fully grasped: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1462206\/remarks-by-joe-biden-on-george-floyd-and-the-unfolding-situation-in-minnesota&speechType=1","Summary":"Civil Liberties and Civil Rights Criminal Justice","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/joebiden.com\/2020\/05\/29\/my-remarks-on-george-floyd-and-the-unfolding-situation-in-minnesota\/","CleanText":"Once again , the words 'I can't breathe.'

The original sin of this country still stains our nation today. Sometimes we manage to overlook it, and just push forward with the thousand other tasks of daily life. But it's always there. And weeks like this, we see it plainly. We are a country with an open wound. None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words , 'I can't breathe' , and do nothing. We cannot fall victim to what Martin Luther King called the 'appalling silence of the good people.' Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering , who will be next? Imagine if every time your husband or son, wife or daughter, left the house, you feared for their safety from bad actors and bad police. Imagine if you had to have that talk with your child about not asserting their rights , and taking the abuse handed out to them , just so they could make it home. Imagine having the police called on you , for just sitting in Starbucks or renting an Airbnb or watching birds. That is the norm for black people in this nation , they don't have to imagine it. The anger and the frustration and the exhaustion , it's undeniable. But that is not the promise of America. And it is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all people. This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism. It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation. We need justice for George Floyd. We need real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet , that holds bad cops accountable, and that repairs the relationship between law enforcement and the community they are sworn to protect. And we need to stand up as a nation , with the black community, and with all minority communities , and come together as one America. That's the challenge we face. And it will require those of us who sit in positions of influence to finally deal with the abuse of power. The pain is too immense for one community to bear alone. It is the duty of every American to grapple with it , and grapple with it now. With our complacency, our silence , we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence. Nothing about this will be easy or comfortable. But if we simply allow this wound to scab over once more, without treating the underlying injury , we will never truly heal. The very soul of America is at stake. We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. We have to pursue it with real urgency. We have to make real the American promise, which we have never fully grasped: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives."}

The United States has always strived to serve as a beacon of hope , a role model in resettling refugees and leading the humanitarian response abroad. But today is also a bitter reminder of how Donald Trump has tried to change America from a nation of refuge and liberty to one of division and intolerance. Fear-mongering, xenophobia, and racism are the unabashed tenets of Trump's refugee and immigration policy, and his divisive, dangerous, and undemocratic response to Black Lives Matter is a reminder of this administration's devaluation of Black, Brown, and other minority communities not only in the United States, but around the world. But we will not, and we cannot, allow hate and rage to divide us further. Decades ago, giants of the civil rights movement like Bayard Rustin recognized the universal fight for freedom and safety and urged the United States to accept more refugees. Their call is even more urgent today as the number of those forcibly displaced worldwide reaches nearly 80 million people worldwide , roughly 1 percent of humanity. Donald Trump has made clear that he does not believe our country should be a place of refuge. He has slashed refugee admissions by more than 80 percent and, just this past week, released an immoral and likely unlawful rule that makes it nearly impossible for most asylum-seekers to qualify for protection in the United States . He has cruelly separated thousands of children from their parents, sought to prevent victims of gang and domestic violence from receiving asylum, and severely limited the ability of members of the LGBTQ+ community, an especially vulnerable group in many parts of the world, from qualifying for asylum. And he has turned his back on the men and women who served honorably alongside our soldiers, diplomats, and aid workers in Iraq and Afghanistan as interpreters and guides, and now find that their lives, and the lives of their families, are threatened for this service. This cannot stand. As one of the co-sponsors of the 1980 Refugee Act, I believe that resettling refugees helps reunite families, enriches the fabric of America, and enhances our standing, influence, and security in the world. Right now, many refugees are also working on the frontlines of the pandemic response, as nursing aides, doctors, meatpackers, and grocery clerks, among other essential workers. Restoring America's historic role as leader in resettlement and defending the rights of refugees everywhere will take concrete action. As President, I will increase the number of refugees we welcome into this country, setting an annual global refugee target of 125,000 , up from a ceiling of 18,000 under Trump , and will seek to further raise it over time commensurate with our responsibility, our values, and the unprecedented global need. I will support efforts to work with Congress in a bipartisan fashion to protect our refugee policy from drastic and arbitrary reductions we have seen during the Trump Administration and establish a minimum admissions number of at least 95,000 refugees annually. I will pursue policies that increase opportunities for faith and local communities to sponsor refugee resettlement. I will make more channels, such as higher education visas, available to those seeking safety. I will repeal the Muslim ban , and other discriminatory bans based on ethnicity and nationality , and restore asylum laws, including ending the horrific practice of separating families at our border. I will work with our allies and partners to stand against China's assault on Hong Kong's freedoms and mass detention and repression of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities and support a pathway for those persecuted to find safe haven in the United States and other nations. I also recognize that it is not enough to simply reverse or dismantle the heartless policies of the Trump Administration. We need to look for ways to do better. On this World Refugee Day, we all must stand together and recommit to building a more inclusive and welcoming America.

{"SpeechID":"VSJB3062020207","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-06-30","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden's Remarks on Trump's Failures to Protect the American People","Type":"speech","RawText":"For weeks, we've seen the warning signs , the numbers don't lie. Infection rates are now going up in more states than they are going down. More than 125,000 people in the United States have lost their lives, and those numbers and new infections continue to grow at an alarming rate. And once again it's confirming the simple fact that we won't be able to solve the economic crisis without a rigorous public health approach. Despite the Administration's propaganda that their response should be \"a cause for celebration,\" despite President Trump's request that we should slow down testing, because he thinks it makes him look bad, COVID-19 is still here. A daily threat to American health and prosperity. It did not have to be this way. Month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us. Month after month, as many of us urged him to step up and do his job, he failed us. Just look at the record. In January, I sounded the alarm over the coronavirus outbreak. Trump told the country that he had COVID-19 \"totally under control\" and that everything would all \"work out well.\" In February, I warned about our failure to get information we needed from the Chinese government. I said if I were President, I would demand it. Trump said we were in \"great shape\" and reported that China's president said it was \"doing very well.\" In March, I set forth a detailed plan for 500 federally-funded testing sites across the country as well as guaranteed emergency paid leave. And later that month, I called for the full and immediate use of the Defense Production Act to deliver critical supplies. Trump accused health care workers of stealing masks. In April, I released plans to secure the supply chain for personal protective equipment, surge nationwide testing through a Pandemic Testing Board, and launch a nationwide health corps to focus on contact tracing. Trump's suggestion? Americans should inject disinfectants into their bodies. In May, I condemned the false choice between preserving our public health and our economy. I urged the Administration to focus on the basic public health measures like testing that would enable us to sustain our economic recovery. Trump's response? He pushed for reopening without regard for safety and called testing \"frankly overrated.\" This month, I outlined a path to reopen our country safely and sustainably. It provided workers, small businesses, schools, and state and local governments the tools, resources, and guidance they would need. Trump's proposal? He set a cutoff date for federal funding for testing sites in several states, and actually went to court to take health care away from millions. And now, Donald Trump is in retreat. Remember back in March when he called himself a wartime president? Remember when he exhorted the nation to \"sacrifice together\" to face an \"invisible enemy\"? What happened? Now it's almost July and it seems the wartime president has surrendered , has waved the white flag and left the field of battle. Today we're facing a serious threat, and we must meet it , as one country. But this President gives us no direction. He pits us against one another. We can't continue on like this , half recovering and half getting worse. We can't continue , half wearing masks and half rejecting science We can't continue , half with a plan and half just hoping for the best. We won't defeat this virus with a piecemeal approach , lifting restrictions prematurely,increasing the volatility of the crisis, and raising the likelihood of needing to re-impose restrictions. Until our science catches up to our reality , until we have better treatments for those who become infected and ultimately a safe, proven, widely available vaccine , we have to continue to do all we can as a people and as a government to keep our fellow Americans safe and healthy. Today, I am releasing a plan with the steps Donald Trump should undertake immediately. It builds on the roadmap I released back in March that would have saved lives if it had been adopted. It is a plan to save lives in the months ahead. Once again , I encourage him to adopt this plan in its entirety. This is too important for politics. First, testing, testing, testing. More testing is not only how you find more cases of coronavirus, Mr. President,it's how you stop more cases. Testing , followed by rigorous contact tracing and quarantine and isolation protocols for those who have been exposed. People aren't waiting in miles-long lines in baking hot cars for a drive-through nasal swab for the fun of it. They're doing it so they can protect themselves and their families. We know we're not where we need to be on testing. There are still hospitals and nursing homes that don't have access to the tests they need. Testing is how we see what's happening in communities all across the country. It's our eyes on the ground. Without it, we're flying blind. That's why it's so important to have reliable access to testing everywhere. We need to increase federal support for testing , that includes doubling the number of drive-through testing sites. And keep increasing them until there are no lines. We should create a Pandemic Testing Board to spearhead a nationwide campaign so every worker who is called back to their job can have the confidence that they and their co-workers are not infected. Experts agree that we need more contact tracers to track the path of this virus. Individual states like New York and California are already hiring and training thousands of tracers. But we need more,including hiring at least 100,000 federally funded workers to perform contact tracing and other public health tasks. Second, every single front line worker should have the personal protective equipment they need to be safe. Five months into this crisis, and our health care workers are still forced to scramble for their own supplies and must reuse masks , shift after shift. Hundreds of health care workers have died from COVID-19, and tens of thousands have been infected. It should be zero on both counts. How are we this many months in and we still , still , don't have what we need? This is why we have a Defense Production Act. Use your authority this week, Mr. President, to scale up the production of N-95 masks. The steps you've taken so far haven't gotten the job done. Fix the shortage of PPE for our health care workers before you tee off for yet another round of golf. We can't just look at where we are today , we're going to need masks and gloves and face shields for the foreseeable future. We need to be ready. Third, there should be a laser-focus on treatments and vaccines. We should be leading a coordinated, global approach on the science , not disregarding the experts while pushing dangerous and disproven drugs as a treatment. There has been some progress towards treatments and vaccines. But the administration hasn't been transparent about how they plan to manufacture enough doses, and make sure they are equitably distributed at scale. Every person in the United States must be able to get the vaccine when available. The White House should report weekly on this progress. We can't end up with the same scarcity and distribution problems we did with testing. And we need to make sure that consumers aren't being gouged as new drugs and therapies are developed. We must immediately restore our relationship with the World Health Organization. For all its shortcomings and missteps around COVID-19, this is why the WHO was created. It is essential to coordinating a global response during a pandemic. And the United States should be leading the way. COVID-19 will likely worsen at the onset of flu season this year. So we need to put in place measures now to ensure the seasonal flu vaccine can be readily available and administered safely to those who need it under social distancing guidelines , especially for seniors. Fourth, we need real plans, real guidelines with uniform, nation-wide standards to help chart our economic reopening. Whatever it is that we're doing now , it's not working. A state-by-state approach will only produce confusion and slow any progress. The CDC tried to develop clear guidelines about what the stages of re-opening should look like , the Administration delayed and scaled them back. We need clear, evidence-based steps that states can adopt , both the standards that must be met in order to safely proceed with further opening, and the re-imposition of social distancing rules when cases begin to rise. We need to support schools and child care programs so parents can return to work, confident that their kids will be safe and cared for. We should be providing \"Safer for Shoppers\" certifications to stores that prove they are minimizing their customers' risk of exposure. And we absolutely need a clear message from the very top of our federal government , that everyone needs to wear a mask in public. Period. It's not just about you , it's about your family, your neighbors, your colleagues. It's about keeping other people safe. It's a simple measure that is also one of the most effective things we can do right now. It may be inconvenient , but it's the right thing to do as an American. Finally,we need to protect the populations most at risk from this virus. Our Seniors. Our Black and Brown and Native communities that are being hit the hardest. Vulnerable populations with pre-existing conditions. I know that this continued growth in case numbers is causing fear. People , especially older Americans and those with loved ones in nursing homes , are scared. This isn't just taking a toll on their physical health, there's an emotional cost as well. We can't expect vulnerable populations to quarantine indefinitely without support. And I want them to know that their health and safety will be my responsibility as president. I will not abandon you. Those are five simple, straightforward steps that will help us defeat this pandemic. And if you suspect that a lot of these steps are the same sorts of things I was talking about in March when I released my first COVID-19 Response Plan , you're right. If it feels like you've been hearing the experts talk about these same issues for months, you're right. These have always been the steps the government needed to put in place to meet this threat. The state-wide lockdowns that so many Americans lived under for months were intended to buy us the time to get our act together. But instead of using that time to prepare ourselves , Donald Trump squandered it. Now here we are, more than three months later, and we're hardly better prepared than we were in March. Infections on the rise. The threat of massive spikes that overwhelm the capacity of our health care system. Americans anxious and out of work, fearful for their lives and their loved ones. And Donald Trump is doing next-to-nothing about it. Mr. President , the crisis is real , and it's surging. Promises and predictions and wishful thinking pulled out of thin air are not only doing this country no good, it's making them lose more faith in their government America knows this crisis isn't behind us. Even if you don't. They see what is happening. Even if you refuse to. They know a coordinated national plan is needed now. Even though you won't do it. You've called yourself a \"cheerleader\" for the nation. We don't need a cheerleader. We need a President. A president who will level with the American people. A president who will tell us the unvarnished truth. A president who will take responsibility instead of always blaming others. A president who will listen to the experts and follow the science. A president who will lead and be an example for the nation: Wear a mask, keep your distance, limit the size of any crowd. It's not about you, Mr. President , it's about the health and well-being of the American public. The American people didn't make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rantings and tweets. They didn't make these sacrifices so you could ignore the science and turn responsible steps like wearing a mask into a political statement. And they certainly didn't do it so you could wash your hands and walk away. Maybe there are times this nation needs a cheerleader. Now isn't one of them. We need a president. Whatever Trump does , or does not do , we cannot know today what the state of the COVID-19 pandemic will be next January. But it almost certainly won't be over. If I should have the honor of being elected President, on the day I'm sworn in I'll get right to work implementing all aspects of the response that remain undone. I'll have more to say about my Day One COVID-19 agenda in the weeks to come. But my response will begin well before I take the oath of office. It will start as soon as the election is decided. I will be a president who respects scientists, and who won't censor their ability to speak directly to the American people. I'll immediately reach out to Dr. Anthony Fauci to ask him to continue his incredible service to our country. I'll have from day one , ready to go , the best medical experts and scientists to advise on our response. And I'll listen to them. I will work with governors and mayors of both parties, and from every state, territory, and tribe. We are all in this together. We will fight this together. And we will emerge from this stronger, because we did it together. And now, I'm happy to take a few of your questions.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1461607\/joe-bidens-remarks-on-trumps-failures-to-protect-the-american-people&speechType=1","Summary":"Health and Health Care","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/joebiden.com\/2020\/06\/30\/my-remarks-on-trumps-failures-to-protect-the-american-people\/","CleanText":"For weeks, we've seen the warning signs , the numbers don't lie.

Every person in the United States must be able to get the vaccine when available. The White House should report weekly on this progress. We can't end up with the same scarcity and distribution problems we did with testing. And we need to make sure that consumers aren't being gouged as new drugs and therapies are developed. We must immediately restore our relationship with the World Health Organization. For all its shortcomings and missteps around COVID-19, this is why the WHO was created. It is essential to coordinating a global response during a pandemic. And the United States should be leading the way. COVID-19 will likely worsen at the onset of flu season this year. So we need to put in place measures now to ensure the seasonal flu vaccine can be readily available and administered safely to those who need it under social distancing guidelines , especially for seniors. Fourth, we need real plans, real guidelines with uniform, nation-wide standards to help chart our economic reopening. Whatever it is that we're doing now , it's not working. A state-by-state approach will only produce confusion and slow any progress. The CDC tried to develop clear guidelines about what the stages of re-opening should look like , the Administration delayed and scaled them back. We need clear, evidence-based steps that states can adopt , both the standards that must be met in order to safely proceed with further opening, and the re-imposition of social distancing rules when cases begin to rise. We need to support schools and child care programs so parents can return to work, confident that their kids will be safe and cared for. We should be providing 'Safer for Shoppers' certifications to stores that prove they are minimizing their customers' risk of exposure. And we absolutely need a clear message from the very top of our federal government , that everyone needs to wear a mask in public. Period. It's not just about you , it's about your family, your neighbors, your colleagues. It's about keeping other people safe. It's a simple measure that is also one of the most effective things we can do right now. It may be inconvenient , but it's the right thing to do as an American. Finally,we need to protect the populations most at risk from this virus. Our Seniors. Our Black and Brown and Native communities that are being hit the hardest. Vulnerable populations with pre-existing conditions. I know that this continued growth in case numbers is causing fear. People , especially older Americans and those with loved ones in nursing homes , are scared. This isn't just taking a toll on their physical health, there's an emotional cost as well. We can't expect vulnerable populations to quarantine indefinitely without support. And I want them to know that their health and safety will be my responsibility as president. I will not abandon you. Those are five simple, straightforward steps that will help us defeat this pandemic. And if you suspect that a lot of these steps are the same sorts of things I was talking about in March when I released my first COVID-19 Response Plan , you're right. If it feels like you've been hearing the experts talk about these same issues for months, you're right. These have always been the steps the government needed to put in place to meet this threat. The state-wide lockdowns that so many Americans lived under for months were intended to buy us the time to get our act together. But instead of using that time to prepare ourselves , Donald Trump squandered it. Now here we are, more than three months later, and we're hardly better prepared than we were in March. Infections on the rise. The threat of massive spikes that overwhelm the capacity of our health care system. Americans anxious and out of work, fearful for their lives and their loved ones. And Donald Trump is doing next-to-nothing about it. Mr. President , the crisis is real , and it's surging. Promises and predictions and wishful thinking pulled out of thin air are not only doing this country no good, it's making them lose more faith in their government America knows this crisis isn't behind us. Even if you don't. They see what is happening. Even if you refuse to. They know a coordinated national plan is needed now. Even though you won't do it. You've called yourself a 'cheerleader' for the nation. We don't need a cheerleader. We need a President. A president who will level with the American people. A president who will tell us the unvarnished truth. A president who will take responsibility instead of always blaming others. A president who will listen to the experts and follow the science. A president who will lead and be an example for the nation: Wear a mask, keep your distance, limit the size of any crowd. It's not about you, Mr. President , it's about the health and well-being of the American public. The American people didn't make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rantings and tweets. They didn't make these sacrifices so you could ignore the science and turn responsible steps like wearing a mask into a political statement. And they certainly didn't do it so you could wash your hands and walk away. Maybe there are times this nation needs a cheerleader. Now isn't one of them. We need a president. Whatever Trump does , or does not do , we cannot know today what the state of the COVID-19 pandemic will be next January. But it almost certainly won't be over. If I should have the honor of being elected President, on the day I'm sworn in I'll get right to work implementing all aspects of the response that remain undone. I'll have more to say about my Day One COVID-19 agenda in the weeks to come. But my response will begin well before I take the oath of office. It will start as soon as the election is decided. I will be a president who respects scientists, and who won't censor their ability to speak directly to the American people. I'll immediately reach out to Dr. Anthony Fauci to ask him to continue his incredible service to our country. I'll have from day one , ready to go , the best medical experts and scientists to advise on our response. And I'll listen to them. I will work with governors and mayors of both parties, and from every state, territory, and tribe. We are all in this together. We will fight this together. And we will emerge from this stronger, because we did it together. And now, I'm happy to take a few of your questions."}
{"SpeechID":"VSJB272020206","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-07-02","SpeechTitle":"Remarks on The Economic Crisis and Jobs Report","Type":"speech","RawText":"Millions more Americans would still have their jobs today if Donald Trump had done his job. And many of the jobs that have now come back should never have been lost in the first place. Good morning , today we learned the latest jobs numbers. Like every American, I'm glad that millions of American workers are back on payrolls and that this historic unemployment we still face has at least come down a bit more. This is a good day for every one of those individuals and families who regained their security. But as happy as I was for millions of workers returning to their jobs , there is one number I was stunned that the president didn't mention even once at his press conference. That number was 50,000. Yesterday, the number of new COVID-19 cases in America topped 50,000 in a single day. We've never hit that number before in the course of this virus. In 45 states, the 7-day average of infections are higher than they were a week ago. In some places, hospital ICUs are at or nearing capacity. And we are seeing all across the country spikes in the virus that are causing many states to impose new restrictions again. To me, and to many Americans, this is a very worrisome turn in the path and severity of the virus. And the president didn't even address it. Yesterday he reiterated his belief that the virus was going to disappear. Today he described what was happening as \"fires\" flaring up in the country. That's just not an honest assessment of what is happening. And it's not just me saying that , the rest of the world knows it too. Just this week, 27 European countries have banned Americans from traveling there because of the surging numbers of COVID-19 in the U.S. and until this president faces what's going on in our country, our economy will remain at risk. Today's report is positive news, and I'm thankful for it. But make no mistake: we are still in a deep, deep jobs hole because Donald Trump has so badly bungled the response to the coronavirus, and now has basically given up responding at all. Millions more Americans would still have their jobs today if Donald Trump had done his job. And many of the jobs that have now come back should never have been lost in the first place. And for everyone whose job hasn't come back , for everyone who doesn't own stock, or who can't get a sweetheart loan through connections , does this feel like victory? For parents who are worried their kids can't go back to school in the Fall, do you feel like this is \"mission accomplished\"? And for people in states where COVID-19 is spiking, and we're seeing record-high numbers of infections , do you feel like this crisis is under control? Of course not. People are scared. They're worried about their families and for the future. But, just like last month, President Trump has spiked the ball and made this about him. He doesn't seem to realize he's not even to the 50-yard line. Only one-third of the jobs that were lost in March and April have now come back , and most of the jobs that returned were for people on temporary furlough. That means these were the easiest jobs to get back as we re-open cities and states. It's only going to get harder from here. Permanent job loss numbers actually went up by 588,000 , to almost 3 million. President Trump touted the job gains for African American workers. But unemployment for black men actually rose , from 15.5 percent in May to 16.3 percent in June. He touted the numbers for Latino unemployment , but those numbers are still more than three times higher than they were before this crisis started. And let's not lose sight of a critical point. Treport measures job gains as of June 12. In the days since, we've seen cases spiking, some businesses have to close down again, some states reimposing restrictions. And, in the last two weeks, we've seen almost 3 million new unemployment filings, and another 1.7 million people seek special pandemic unemployment insurance. There's no victory to be celebrated when we're still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse, not better. Millions of Americans who are still out of work, wondering when or if their job will come back, and worried about how to pay the bills in the meantime. Trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved. He's deadly wrong , on both fronts. We're already at more than 128,000 dead , and that number keeps climbing. That's a direct consequence of Donald Trump's bungled leadership and total mismanagement of this crisis from the start. His failure to take quick action made this pandemic more costly for the American people in every way , in lives lost, in economic impact, in the emotional toll of living with so much doubt and uncertainty. And now , as I said on Tuesday , he's surrendered to this virus. Other countries have figured out how to get the virus under control, re-open their economies, and put their people back to work. Other leaders didn't waste the time they were given from stay at home orders , they got to work solving the root cause of this crisis , the coronavirus. Donald Trump's just given up. He's not even trying to secure our public health anymore. He'd rather get back to his campaign rallies. He's not interested in uniting us to fight our common threat. He's decided he has more to gain by dividing this country for his own political purposes. Without a uniform plan, and guidance from the federal government that state and local leaders can use to inform their re-opening plans, this is going to continue to be worse than it would otherwise be. Recovery will be slower. Unemployment will stay higher than it should be. Has he even once expressed real empathy for the families who will never again be whole because of this virus? Has he done anything real to prioritize support for working Americans who need help now? Democrats in Congress have put forward legislation to reward and protect our brave frontline workers, help working families find child care, and extend the supplemental unemployment benefits for people for the duration of the economic crisis. Meanwhile Republicans and President Trump are stalling on support for working families, even as they dole out tax-payer money to big corporations with zero accountability. Has Donald Trump even acknowledged the disproportionate impact this disease is having on Black and Brown and Native communities , much less done anything to address these health disparities or the underlying systemic racism that shapes them? Of course not. That would require him to step up and lead. It would require him to put the American people ahead of his own interests. It didn't have to be like this. America has more reported deaths and infections than anywhere else in the world. Our health care workers are still rationing personal protective equipment. We still don't have sufficient testing to allow people to return to work with confidence. President Trump has turned wearing a mask into a political statement. And just yesterday, he was once more claiming that the coronavirus would \"just disappear, I hope.\" It's like deja vu all over again. We're months into this crisis and that's still your best answer? Quit hoping for the best, Mr. President. Quit claiming victory with almost 15 million Americans still out of work because of this crisis. Quit ignoring the reality of this pandemic and the horrifying loss of American life. Act. Lead. Or get out of the way so others can.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1461600\/remarks-on-the-economic-crisis-and-jobs-report&speechType=1","Summary":"Unemployed and Low-Income Health and Health Care","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/joebiden.com\/2020\/07\/02\/remarks-on-the-economic-crisis-and-jobs-report\/","CleanText":"Millions more Americans would still have their jobs today if Donald Trump had done his job.

{"SpeechID":"VSJB972020204","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-07-09","SpeechTitle":"The Future Must Be Made in America -- by All of America. Here's how We'll Do It.","Type":"speech","RawText":"\"Build Back Better\" Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President Joe Biden in Dunmore, Pennsylvania Thank you. It's great to be back in Scranton. It's great to be back in Dunmore. And it's great to be back home. I want to thank Bob and everyone here at McGregor Industries for showing me around this morning. This is the kind of small manufacturing business that demonstrates the resilience, creativity, and staying-power of America's industrial base. We're living through a time unlike any in American history. Our country is facing three crises simultaneously. A pandemic that has infected over 3 million Americans and cost more than 130,000 lives , and shows no signs of slowing down. An economic crisis that has left almost 18 million Americans out of work , with some of the greatest pain inflicted on small businesses and communities of color. And a national reckoning on the issue of racial injustice that has long plagued our country. These come on top of widening economic inequality and a mounting climate crisis. Each of these is an enormous challenge that is testing our strength, our patience, our resilience, our commitment to our core values, and our commitment to one another. But each of these is also a tremendous opportunity for our nation. An opportunity to prepare now for the future threats we know are rising around the world. An opportunity to address the fundamental inequities in our nation , the growing gap between the very wealthy and everyone else. And an opportunity to finally , and fully , live up to the words and the values enshrined in the founding documents of this nation. That we are all created equal and are entitled to be treated equally throughout our lives. We all know the stakes couldn't be higher. That's why this is no time for divisive politics. Donald Trump may believe in pitting Americans against Americans. I don't. We have a health crisis. An economic crisis. A racial justice crisis. A climate crisis. And we need to come together as Americans to solve them. This is our moment to imagine and to build a new American economy for our families and the next generation. An economy where every American gets a fair return for their work , and an equal chance to get ahead. An economy that is more powerful precisely because everyone is cut in on the deal. An economy that says investing in the American people and working families is more important than the nearly $2 trillion dollar tax break Trump predominantly handed out to the richest Americans. Donald Trump loves to talk and talk and talk. But after three and a half years of big promises, what do the American people have to show for it? He promised a health care plan , but he never even offered his own bill. Instead he fought repeatedly to take health care away from tens of millions. He promised an infrastructure plan and never delivered. He promised to bring back jobs, but manufacturing was in recession even before COVID-19. He promised to buy American, but he let federal contractors double the rate of offshoring jobs in his first 18 months in office. And when it comes to COVID-19, after months of doing nothing other than predicting the virus would disappear , Trump has simply given up. He's waved the white flag and walked away. And his failures come with a terrible human cost and a deep economic toll. Time and time again, working families are paying the price for Donald Trump's incompetence. Small business has ended up with the short end of the stick, too. Less than a third of the massive amount of money the Congress and the Federal Reserve made available to the private sector has gone to Main Street businesses. Big business , the wealthy , Trump's cronies and pals , they've been the big winners, again. The truth is, throughout this crisis, Donald Trump has been almost singularly focused on the stock market the Dow the NASDAQ not you not your families. But if I'm elected president, I will be laser-focused on working families and the middle class , not the wealthy investor class. And this will be my guiding principle: We will reward hard work , not excessive wealth. You see, growing up rich and looking down on people is very different from how I grew up here in Scranton. Here, nobody thought Wall Street bankers and CEOs built this country. You could just look around your neighborhood , or your kitchen table , and see who built this country. It was at my grandfather Finnegan's kitchen table that I learned money doesn't determine your worth. He'd say: Joey, no one in the world is more worthy than you , and everyone is your equal. My dad taught me: A job is about a lot more than a paycheck , it's about dignity, respect, your place in the community. And I remember my uncle saying, \"Joey, you're labor from belt buckle to shoe sole\" , and I took pride in it. Determination. Resilience. Grit. The strength to get up no matter how many times you've been knocked down. Respect for hard work. And for the people who do it. Those are the values I learned growing up in Scranton. And those are the values I'll take with me into the Oval Office. I'll give more help to Main Street businesses and entrepreneurs and ask more of corporate America. Nearly half the jobs in America are in small businesses. And even back in early May, some estimates found that more than 100,000 small businesses had been permanently shut down. More have closed since. It's been devastating. Enough. Enough. It's time to reverse the priorities in this country. Let's help small businesses manage through this pandemic and recover , and let's help millions of would-be entrepreneurs get out from under their debts so they can start a business. And it's time corporate America paid their fair share in taxes. The days of Amazon paying nothing in federal income taxes should be over. Let's make sure their workers have more power and a voice. It's way past time we put an end to this era of shareholder capitalism. The idea that the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders is an absolute farce. They have a responsibility to their workers, to their community and their country. That isn't a new or radical notion. Those are the basic values and principles , that helped build this nation. Now the challenge is to take those fundamental values , and apply them to the new economy we have to build in the years ahead. I call my plan to do it the \"Build Back Better\" plan. It's bold. It's practical. It's focused on building the economy of the future, not the past. And it responds to five truths laid bare in this moment of crisis. First, we've seen in the course of this pandemic the need to strengthen our industrial base as a long-term source of middle class job creation. Let's use this opportunity to make bold investments in American industry and innovation so the future is Made In America , and in all of America. I do not accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we can't keep well-paid union jobs here in America , and create more of them. I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. American manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II, and must be part of the engine of American prosperity now. So today, I'm releasing a detailed blueprint for how we create millions of good-paying union jobs building the products and technologies we will need now and in the future. It starts with a pretty basic idea: when we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. My plan would tighten the rules to make this a reality. And it goes further. During my first term alone, we'll invest $400 billion to purchase products and materials our country needs to modernize our infrastructure, to replenish our critical stockpiles, and to enhance our national security. These funds will provide a reliable, predictable demand for products made by American workers and supply chains of American small businesses. We'll purchase clean energy technologies to fight climate change; building materials, including steel products like those produced here; stockpiles of critical goods and equipment; and advanced technologies to modernize our government and enhance our national security. To ensure the future is made in America, we need to win not just the jobs of today , but the jobs and industries of tomorrow. That means fighting unfair trade practices and curbing the theft of American intellectual property by countries like China. America can't sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. That's why I am proposing a dramatic Research & Development investment , $300 billion in my first four years alone , to sharpen America's competitive edge in new industries where global leadership is up for grabs, like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and clean energy. And this money will be used purposefully to ensure all of America is in on the deal , including communities that have historically been left out , Black, Brown, and Native American entrepreneurs, cities and towns in every region of the country. All told, this will be a mobilization of R&D and procurement investments in ways not seen since World War II. In addition to bringing back the jobs that have been lost this year, my plan will help create at least five million new jobs , good paying jobs , in manufacturing and innovation right here in the United States. Second, we've seen the importance of a more resilient economy for the long-term. Our president wasn't prepared for the pandemic. He ignored the detailed briefings and warnings about the threat of pandemics that we gave to his administration in the transition. He shut down the pandemic office we had in the White House. He praised the Chinese government even as the virus was coming to our shores because he was so afraid they would walk away from his trade deal. Let's not get caught flat-footed again. Let's get prepared to meet the accelerating climate crisis. That means investing in infrastructure and clean energy and creating millions of good-paying union jobs in the process. Next week, I'll be laying out an updated blueprint for how we build a modern, safe, sustainable infrastructure and clean energy economy , how we make sure the communities who have suffered the most from pollution are first to benefit from this investment , and how to strengthen the union movement, by making sure that unions are building America, just like they built the middle class. Third, we've seen in this pandemic the immense burdens working parents, and especially women, are carrying as they try to work and care for their children or their aging parents or their loved ones with disabilities. It's been especially hard in this crisis , but let's face it, it's always hard. So let's make it easier to afford child care and care for aging relatives. And let's offer more pay and more economic dignity for the millions of workers , often women, and women of color , who we entrust to help teach our youngest and care for our oldest loved ones. Donald Trump has no idea what it is to be a single parent who's barely getting by but needs to find child care. He hasn't a clue what it's like to provide care for an aging parent. That's understandable. But it's unconscionable that he doesn't even really try to empathize with those who are struggling. Like a lot of you, I understand it personally. I know how hard it is to be a single dad who has to work with two young sons at home. I know what it means to bring your aging parent into your home to take care of them in their final years. I've done both. And it's hard. And it's hard for millions of Americans who are just trying to make ends meet. In the weeks ahead, I'll be laying out a plan to mobilize American talent and hearts to build a 21st century caregiving and education workforce. Fourth, we've seen millions of American workers and small business owners put their lives on the line to keep our country going. We need to treat these folks and their families as essential not just in times of crisis , but at all times. Maybe Donald Trump can look those grocery store workers in the eye and tell them they're not worth $15 an hour, or spend time with frontline workers and then tell them they shouldn't have the right to organize for better pay, paid leave, benefits, and working conditions. Maybe he can. But I can't. And I won't. It's not enough to just praise these workers. We need to pay them. And let's finish the job of Obamacare by ensuring everyone has access to quality affordable health care. Let's lower the cost of prescription drugs, stop the surprise bills, and provide a public option to cover the millions of Americans without care. Let's make sure everyone has access to a good education regardless of their zip code. Let's triple the amount of money we direct to Title 1 schools in America. You've got 18 Title 1 schools here in Scranton and Dunmore. Imagine how big a difference that will make. I think because of this pandemic, everyone has a renewed appreciation for just how hard our teachers work and how important their job is , let's give them the resources and support they need to both get through this crisis and to empower the next generation of American ground- breakers. Let's pay them. Finally, we've seen with horrifying clarity the costs of systemic racism in America. We need a comprehensive agenda for racial equity in this country. This isn't just about police reform. It's about dealing with the deep wound of systemic racism in this nation. So, we need a dedicated agenda to close the wealth gap, to expand affordable housing, to invest in Black, Brown, AAPI and Native American entrepreneurs, and to make real the promise of educational opportunity. For too long the battle for racial equity has divided America , when it should unite us. Donald Trump cynically claims that he is defending America's heritage by embracing a flag and public monuments to people who tried to permanently rip this nation apart. Do you think Trump has any idea that 360,000 Pennsylvanians fought on the side of the Union to defeat that flag , including more Black soldiers than any other state. Do you think he has any clue that 33,000 Pennsylvanians died in the Civil War fighting against everything that flag stood for. I see a different America than Trump. One that, despite all our flaws and shortcomings and failings, is still after more than two centuries dedicated to equality, liberty, human dignity and justice. The challenges we face today are among the biggest in our history. We have to come together as a country to solve them , there is no other way. I have long said that America is at its best when we are one people, one nation, One America. That's the tragedy of Donald Trump being our president today. He is exactly the wrong person to lead us at this moment. He will not bring this country together. He is determined to drive us apart. He will not be a president for all the people. He believes he was elected to represent only his base. He will not appeal to the best in us. He is determined to stoke and revive the worst moments from our past. I have no illusions about how tough the road ahead is for our country. But I'm optimistic for one reason above all others. I know the history and the heart of this country. And given the chance , just a chance , ordinary Americans can do extraordinary things. They have never, ever, ever let their country down. And they won't let the country down now. The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself. So we just need to remember who we are. This is the United States of America. And there is nothing , not a single thing , we have ever failed to do. When we've done it together. Thank you.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1461596\/the-future-must-be-made-in-america-by-all-of-america-heres-how-well-do-it&speechType=1","Summary":"Civil Liberties and Civil Rights Health and Health Care Economy and Fiscal Business, Consumers, and Employees","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/joebiden.com\/2020\/07\/09\/the-future-must-be-made-in-america-by-all-of-america\/","CleanText":"'Build Back Better' Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President Joe Biden in Dunmore, Pennsylvania Thank you. It's great to be back in Scranton. It's great to be back in Dunmore. And it's great to be back home. I want to thank Bob and everyone here at McGregor Industries for showing me around this morning. This is the kind of small manufacturing business that demonstrates the resilience, creativity, and staying-power of America's industrial base. We're living through a time unlike any in American history. Our country is facing three crises simultaneously. A pandemic that has infected over 3 million Americans and cost more than 130,000 lives , and shows no signs of slowing down. An economic crisis that has left almost 18 million Americans out of work , with some of the greatest pain inflicted on small businesses and communities of color. And a national reckoning on the issue of racial injustice that has long plagued our country. These come on top of widening economic inequality and a mounting climate crisis. Each of these is an enormous challenge that is testing our strength, our patience, our resilience, our commitment to our core values, and our commitment to one another. But each of these is also a tremendous opportunity for our nation. An opportunity to prepare now for the future threats we know are rising around the world. An opportunity to address the fundamental inequities in our nation , the growing gap between the very wealthy and everyone else. And an opportunity to finally , and fully , live up to the words and the values enshrined in the founding documents of this nation. That we are all created equal and are entitled to be treated equally throughout our lives. We all know the stakes couldn't be higher. That's why this is no time for divisive politics. Donald Trump may believe in pitting Americans against Americans. I don't. We have a health crisis. An economic crisis. A racial justice crisis. A climate crisis. And we need to come together as Americans to solve them. This is our moment to imagine and to build a new American economy for our families and the next generation. An economy where every American gets a fair return for their work , and an equal chance to get ahead. An economy that is more powerful precisely because everyone is cut in on the deal. An economy that says investing in the American people and working families is more important than the nearly $2 trillion dollar tax break Trump predominantly handed out to the richest Americans. Donald Trump loves to talk and talk and talk. But after three and a half years of big promises, what do the American people have to show for it? He promised a health care plan , but he never even offered his own bill. Instead he fought repeatedly to take health care away from tens of millions. He promised an infrastructure plan and never delivered. He promised to bring back jobs, but manufacturing was in recession even before COVID-19. He promised to buy American, but he let federal contractors double the rate of offshoring jobs in his first 18 months in office. And when it comes to COVID-19, after months of doing nothing other than predicting the virus would disappear , Trump has simply given up. He's waved the white flag and walked away. And his failures come with a terrible human cost and a deep economic toll. Time and time again, working families are paying the price for Donald Trump's incompetence. Small business has ended up with the short end of the stick, too. Less than a third of the massive amount of money the Congress and the Federal Reserve made available to the private sector has gone to Main Street businesses. Big business , the wealthy , Trump's cronies and pals , they've been the big winners, again. The truth is, throughout this crisis, Donald Trump has been almost singularly focused on the stock market the Dow the NASDAQ not you not your families. But if I'm elected president, I will be laser-focused on working families and the middle class , not the wealthy investor class. And this will be my guiding principle: We will reward hard work , not excessive wealth. You see, growing up rich and looking down on people is very different from how I grew up here in Scranton. Here, nobody thought Wall Street bankers and CEOs built this country. You could just look around your neighborhood , or your kitchen table , and see who built this country. It was at my grandfather Finnegan's kitchen table that I learned money doesn't determine your worth. He'd say: Joey, no one in the world is more worthy than you , and everyone is your equal. My dad taught me: A job is about a lot more than a paycheck , it's about dignity, respect, your place in the community. And I remember my uncle saying, 'Joey, you're labor from belt buckle to shoe sole' , and I took pride in it. Determination. Resilience. Grit. The strength to get up no matter how many times you've been knocked down. Respect for hard work. And for the people who do it. Those are the values I learned growing up in Scranton. And those are the values I'll take with me into the Oval Office. I'll give more help to Main Street businesses and entrepreneurs and ask more of corporate America. Nearly half the jobs in America are in small businesses. And even back in early May, some estimates found that more than 100,000 small businesses had been permanently shut down. More have closed since. It's been devastating. Enough. Enough. It's time to reverse the priorities in this country. Let's help small businesses manage through this pandemic and recover , and let's help millions of would-be entrepreneurs get out from under their debts so they can start a business. And it's time corporate America paid their fair share in taxes. The days of Amazon paying nothing in federal income taxes should be over. Let's make sure their workers have more power and a voice. It's way past time we put an end to this era of shareholder capitalism. The idea that the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders is an absolute farce. They have a responsibility to their workers, to their community and their country. That isn't a new or radical notion. Those are the basic values and principles , that helped build this nation. Now the challenge is to take those fundamental values , and apply them to the new economy we have to build in the years ahead. I call my plan to do it the 'Build Back Better' plan. It's bold. It's practical. It's focused on building the economy of the future, not the past. And it responds to five truths laid bare in this moment of crisis. First, we've seen in the course of this pandemic the need to strengthen our industrial base as a long-term source of middle class job creation. Let's use this opportunity to make bold investments in American industry and innovation so the future is Made In America , and in all of America. I do not accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we can't keep well-paid union jobs here in America , and create more of them. I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. American manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II, and must be part of the engine of American prosperity now. So today, I'm releasing a detailed blueprint for how we create millions of good-paying union jobs building the products and technologies we will need now and in the future. It starts with a pretty basic idea: when we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. My plan would tighten the rules to make this a reality. And it goes further. During my first term alone, we'll invest $400 billion to purchase products and materials our country needs to modernize our infrastructure, to replenish our critical stockpiles, and to enhance our national security. These funds will provide a reliable, predictable demand for products made by American workers and supply chains of American small businesses. We'll purchase clean energy technologies to fight climate change; building materials, including steel products like those produced here; stockpiles of critical goods and equipment; and advanced technologies to modernize our government and enhance our national security. To ensure the future is made in America, we need to win not just the jobs of today , but the jobs and industries of tomorrow. That means fighting unfair trade practices and curbing the theft of American intellectual property by countries like China. America can't sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. That's why I am proposing a dramatic Research & Development investment , $300 billion in my first four years alone , to sharpen America's competitive edge in new industries where global leadership is up for grabs, like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and clean energy. And this money will be used purposefully to ensure all of America is in on the deal , including communities that have historically been left out , Black, Brown, and Native American entrepreneurs, cities and towns in every region of the country. All told, this will be a mobilization of R&D and procurement investments in ways not seen since World War II. In addition to bringing back the jobs that have been lost this year, my plan will help create at least five million new jobs , good paying jobs , in manufacturing and innovation right here in the United States. Second, we've seen the importance of a more resilient economy for the long-term. Our president wasn't prepared for the pandemic. He ignored the detailed briefings and warnings about the threat of pandemics that we gave to his administration in the transition. He shut down the pandemic office we had in the White House.

Good afternoon. Yes, I'm here today to talk about infrastructure, jobs, and our clean energy future. But I have to start by speaking to what millions of Americans know when they wake up every morning with more worry, anxiety, and fear , we are still a country in crisis. This pandemic has infected more than 3 million Americans. It has cost more than 135,000 lives , and it shows no signs of slowing down. In just the last few days, 19 states reported record cases, including Florida, which saw more than 15,000 new cases in a single day. Hospitalizations and deaths , two of the most concerning indicators of Trump's failed response , are already unacceptably high, and they're rising. It's gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public. I'm glad he made that shift , but it's not enough, Mr. President. We won't be able to turn the corner and get the American people back to work safely without presidential leadership. \"Open everything now\" isn't a strategy for success. It's barely a slogan. Quit pushing the false choice between protecting our health and protecting our economy. All that does is endanger our recovery on both fronts. Please listen to your own public health experts instead of denigrating them. Do your job, Mr. President. Because if we can't deal with the public health crisis, we can't deal with the economic crisis or deal with almost 18 million Americans who are out of work, and the incredible pain inflicted on small businesses and communities of color. And we can't deal with the climate crisis that could cast an even darker and more permanent shadow over our country and the world. And we won't be able to do what America has always done , come back stronger than everwith grit, toughness, and resilience That's what I want to talk about today. Last week, I shared the outlines of my plan to Build Back Better , a bold plan to build an economy of the future, not the past. The first plank of the plan rejects the defeatist view that automation and globalization mean we can't ensure our future is Made in America, with good-paying union jobs here at home. We clearly can. But today, I'm here in Wilmington to talk about the second plank , how we can create millions of high-quality, union jobs by building a modern infrastructure and a clean energy future. These are the most critical investments we can make for the long-term health and vitality of the American economy and the safety of the American people. Even if we weren't facing a pandemic and an economic crisis, we should be making these investments. One in five miles of our highways are still in \"poor condition.\" Tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair. Tens of millions of Americans lack access to high-speed broadband. To get our people to work and our kids to school safely, to get our goods to market swiftly, and to power a clean energy revolution in this country, we need to modernize America's infrastructure. Despite this overwhelming need, this President and Republicans in Congress have simply failed to act. They continue to break promises to the American people. Donald Trump promised a big infrastructure bill when he ran in 2016. He promised it again in 2017 and in 2018 and in 2019. And he's promising one again. Every few weeks when he needs a distraction from the latest charge of corruption in his staff , or the conviction of high ranking members of his administration and political apparatus , the White House announces it's \"Infrastructure Week.\" But he's never delivered. Never even really tried. Well, I know how to get it done. In 2009, President Obama and I inherited an economy in free fall, and we prevented another Great Depression. We enacted the largest infrastructure plan since President Eisenhower's interstate highway system, not only generating jobs, but improving the safety of our roads. We made the largest investment in clean energy in history , 90 billion dollars. It put us on a path toward a thriving clean energy economy, powering new economic growth and reducing energy costs. Here we are now with the economy in crisis, but with an incredible opportunity not just to build back to where we were before, but better, stronger, more resilient, and more prepared for the challenges that lie ahead. And there is no more consequential challenge that we must meet in this next decade , than the onrushing climate crisis. Left unchecked, it is an existential threat to the health of our planet and to our very survival. That's not up for dispute, Mr. President. When Donald Trump thinks about climate change , he can muster is one word: \"hoax.\" When I think about climate change , I think of a word as well: \"jobs.\" Good-paying, union jobs that put Americans to work: making the air cleaner for our kids to breathe, restoring our crumbling roads and bridges and ports, and making it faster, cheaper, and cleaner to transport American-made goods all across this country, and around the world. Jobs to build and install a network of 500,000 charging stations all across the country, which will not only help the American auto industry lead the world in manufacturing electric vehicles, it will save working families money on gas. Jobs to lay the lines for the second great railroad revolution, which will not only slash pollution , it will slash commute times and open up investment in areas connected to metropolitan centers for the first time. When Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy, he sees windmills somehow causing cancer. When I think about those wind-farms, I see American manufacturing , and American workers , racing to dominate the global market. I see the steel that will be needed , for the windmill platforms and towers and ladders that could be made by small manufacturers like McGregor Industries, where I visited last week. And I see the union-trained and certified men and women who will manufacture and install it all. I see the ports that will come back to life , the longshoremen, and the ship builders, and the communities they support. When Donald Trump thinks about improving energy efficiency by retrofitting lighting systems with LED bulbs, you want to know what he says? He says he doesn't like LEDs because: the light's no good. I always look orange.\" When I think about energy retrofitting for lighting, I see incredible projects like the one here at the Chase Center. I see the small businesses like Preferred Electric that design and install award-winning energy conservation measures that reduce the consumption of electricity and save businesses hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs. I see the master electricians and union workers who went through union apprenticeships , who start off with good wages and quality benefits that only grow from there. These investments will be a win-win-win for this country. Creating jobs. Cutting energy costsbills. Protecting our climate. That's why today I'm releasing my plan to mobilize millions of jobs by building sustainable infrastructure and an equitable clean energy future. In my first four years, we're going to give 4 million buildings all across the country the same energy make-over that the Chase Center got. It's going to create at least one million jobs in construction, engineering and manufacturing to get it done. It's going to make the places where we live, work, and learn healthier, improving indoor air quality and water quality, and it's going to save tens of billions of dollars of energy costs over time. But we're not just going to focus on commercial space, we're going to give direct support to help families do the same thing for their homes. We're going offer cash rebates and low-cost financing to upgrade energy inefficient appliances and windows , improvements that will also cut their monthly energy bills. And we're going to make a major investment to build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that will benefit our communities three-times over: by alleviating the affordable housing crisis, by increasing energy efficiency, and by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to home ownership. Last week I talked about using the purchasing power of the federal government to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing , that's what we're going to do with the American auto industry as well. The United States owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles , and we're going to convert those government fleets to electric vehicles , made and sourced right here in the United States of America. With the government providing the demand and the grants to re-tool factories that are struggling to compete, the U.S. auto industry and its deep bench of suppliers will step up , expanding capacity so that the United States , not China , leads the world in clean vehicle production. And we're going to make it easier for American consumers to switch to electric vehicles too. Not only by building those 500,000 charging stations, but by offering rebates and incentives to swap older, fuel inefficient vehicles for new, clean, American-made models, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil annually. Together, this will mean one million good new jobs in the American auto industry, its supply chains, and the associated infrastructure. We also know that transforming the American electricity sector to produce power without also producing carbon pollution , and electrifying an increasing share of our economy , will be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century. That's why we are going to achieve a carbon-pollution free electricity sector by 2035. And we need to get to work right away. We'll need scientists at national labs and land-grant universities and HBCUs to improve and innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean electricity. We'll need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them. We'll need iron workers and welders to install them. And we'll become the world's largest exporter of these technologies, creating even more jobs. We know how to do this. Our administration rescued the auto industry and helped them retool, made solar energy the same cost as traditional energy, weatherized more than a million homes , and we will do it again , bigger and faster and smarter. And, as we do this work, we need to be mindful of the historic wrongs and the damage that America's industrial rise in the 20th century inflicted on the environment in poor and vulnerable communities , so often Black, Brown, and Native American communities. Polluted air. Polluted water. Toxins raining down on communities that bore the environmental and health burdens, but shared none of the profits. Growing up, breathing that in every day , it's poison. That's partly why there are such incredible rates of childhood asthma in Black and Brown communities. Why Black Americans are almost three times more likely to die of asthma-related causes than white Americans. It's \"Cancer Alley\" in St. James Parish in Louisiana. And it's the cancer clusters along Route 9 here in Delaware. And that's why, today, I'm also releasing a slate of environmental justice policies that build on my existing plan. This is an area of incredible opportunity for economic growth for our country , but we have to make sure that the first people to benefit are those who have been hurt the most by centuries of structural disparities. I'm setting a goal of making sure that these frontline and fenceline communities, whether in rural places or in city centers, receive 40 percent of the benefits from the investments we're making , in housing, in pollution reduction, in workforce development, in transportation , across the board. And we're also going to create jobs for people by cleaning up the environmental hazards that have now been abandoned. More than a quarter million jobs , right away , to do things like plug the millions of abandoned oil and gas wells that exist all across this country, posing a daily threat to the health and safety of our communities. And we're going to hold accountable those CEOs and corporations that benefited from decades of subsidies , then just walked away from their responsibilities to these communities , leaving wells to leak dangerous pollutants and greenhouse gasses into the air and water. And we're not only going to repeal those subsidies, we're going to go after those golden parachutes the CEOs gave themselves before declaring bankruptcy, and make sure workers receive the benefits and retirements they were promised. Let's create new markets for our family farmers and ranchers , and a new, modern day Civilian Climate Corps to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. These aren't pie-in-the-sky dreams. They're actionable policies that we can get to work on right away. We can live up to our responsibilities, meet the challenges of a world at risk of a climate catastrophe, build more climate-resilient communities, put millions of skilled workers on the job, and make life markedly better and safer for the American people all at once. The alternative , to ignore the facts, to deny reality, to focus only on the technology of the last century, instead of inventing the technologies that will define this century , it's just plain un-American. That is all that Donald Trump and the Republicans offer: Backward-looking politics that will harm the environment, make communities less healthy, and hold back economic progress while other countries race ahead. It's a mindset that doesn't have any faith in the capacity of the American people to compete, to innovate, and to win. And it will extract a deadly cost. I know better. And I know you do, as well. I know what the American people are capable of. I know what American workers can accomplish when given the room to run. I know that climate change is the challenge that's going to define our American future , and I know meeting this challenge will be a once-in-a-century opportunity to jolt new life into our economy, strengthen our global leadership, and protect our planet for future generations. And, if I have the honor of being elected President, we're not just going to tinker around the edges. We're going to make historic investments that will seize this opportunity and meet this moment in history. We're going to get to work delivering results right away , on day one. We're going to reverse Trump's roll backs of 100 public health and environmental rules , and then forge a path to greater ambition. We're going to get back into the Paris Agreement , and back into the business of leading the world. And we're going to lock-in progress that no future president can roll back or undercut to take us backwards again. Science requires a timeline for measurable progress on climate that isn't three decades or even two. Science tells us we will only have nine years to act before the damage is irreversible. So my timeline for results is my first four years as president , the jobs we'll create, the investments we'll make, and the irreversible steps we'll take to mitigate and adapt to climate change and to put our nation on the road to net-zero emissions by no later than 2050. So let's not waste any more time. Let's get to work. Thank you.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1461595\/were-going-to-build-back-better-and-create-a-clean-energy-future&speechType=1","Summary":"Environment","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/joebiden.com\/2020\/07\/14\/were-going-to-build-back-better-and-create-a-clean-energy-future\/","CleanText":"I know that climate change is the challenge that's going to define our American future , and I know meeting this challenge will be a once-in-a-century opportunity to jolt new life into our economy, strengthen our global leadership, and protect our planet for future generations. Good afternoon. Yes, I'm here today to talk about infrastructure, jobs, and our clean energy future. But I have to start by speaking to what millions of Americans know when they wake up every morning with more worry, anxiety, and fear , we are still a country in crisis. This pandemic has infected more than 3 million Americans. It has cost more than 135,000 lives , and it shows no signs of slowing down. In just the last few days, 19 states reported record cases, including Florida, which saw more than 15,000 new cases in a single day. Hospitalizations and deaths , two of the most concerning indicators of Trump's failed response , are already unacceptably high, and they're rising. It's gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public. I'm glad he made that shift , but it's not enough, Mr. President. We won't be able to turn the corner and get the American people back to work safely without presidential leadership. 'Open everything now' isn't a strategy for success. It's barely a slogan. Quit pushing the false choice between protecting our health and protecting our economy. All that does is endanger our recovery on both fronts. Please listen to your own public health experts instead of denigrating them. Do your job, Mr. President. Because if we can't deal with the public health crisis, we can't deal with the economic crisis or deal with almost 18 million Americans who are out of work, and the incredible pain inflicted on small businesses and communities of color. And we can't deal with the climate crisis that could cast an even darker and more permanent shadow over our country and the world. And we won't be able to do what America has always done , come back stronger than everwith grit, toughness, and resilience That's what I want to talk about today. Last week, I shared the outlines of my plan to Build Back Better , a bold plan to build an economy of the future, not the past. The first plank of the plan rejects the defeatist view that automation and globalization mean we can't ensure our future is Made in America, with good-paying union jobs here at home. We clearly can. But today, I'm here in Wilmington to talk about the second plank , how we can create millions of high-quality, union jobs by building a modern infrastructure and a clean energy future. These are the most critical investments we can make for the long-term health and vitality of the American economy and the safety of the American people. Even if we weren't facing a pandemic and an economic crisis, we should be making these investments. One in five miles of our highways are still in 'poor condition.' Tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair. Tens of millions of Americans lack access to high-speed broadband. To get our people to work and our kids to school safely, to get our goods to market swiftly, and to power a clean energy revolution in this country, we need to modernize America's infrastructure. Despite this overwhelming need, this President and Republicans in Congress have simply failed to act. They continue to break promises to the American people. Donald Trump promised a big infrastructure bill when he ran in 2016. He promised it again in 2017 and in 2018 and in 2019. And he's promising one again. Every few weeks when he needs a distraction from the latest charge of corruption in his staff , or the conviction of high ranking members of his administration and political apparatus , the White House announces it's 'Infrastructure Week.' But he's never delivered. Never even really tried. Well, I know how to get it done. In 2009, President Obama and I inherited an economy in free fall, and we prevented another Great Depression. We enacted the largest infrastructure plan since President Eisenhower's interstate highway system, not only generating jobs, but improving the safety of our roads. We made the largest investment in clean energy in history , 90 billion dollars. It put us on a path toward a thriving clean energy economy, powering new economic growth and reducing energy costs. Here we are now with the economy in crisis, but with an incredible opportunity not just to build back to where we were before, but better, stronger, more resilient, and more prepared for the challenges that lie ahead. And there is no more consequential challenge that we must meet in this next decade , than the onrushing climate crisis. Left unchecked, it is an existential threat to the health of our planet and to our very survival. That's not up for dispute, Mr. President. When Donald Trump thinks about climate change , he can muster is one word: 'hoax.' When I think about climate change , I think of a word as well: 'jobs.' Good-paying, union jobs that put Americans to work: making the air cleaner for our kids to breathe, restoring our crumbling roads and bridges and ports, and making it faster, cheaper, and cleaner to transport American-made goods all across this country, and around the world. Jobs to build and install a network of 500,000 charging stations all across the country, which will not only help the American auto industry lead the world in manufacturing electric vehicles, it will save working families money on gas. Jobs to lay the lines for the second great railroad revolution, which will not only slash pollution , it will slash commute times and open up investment in areas connected to metropolitan centers for the first time. When Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy, he sees windmills somehow causing cancer. When I think about those wind-farms, I see American manufacturing , and American workers , racing to dominate the global market. I see the steel that will be needed , for the windmill platforms and towers and ladders that could be made by small manufacturers like McGregor Industries, where I visited last week. And I see the union-trained and certified men and women who will manufacture and install it all. I see the ports that will come back to life , the longshoremen, and the ship builders, and the communities they support. When Donald Trump thinks about improving energy efficiency by retrofitting lighting systems with LED bulbs, you want to know what he says? He says he doesn't like LEDs because: the light's no good. I always look orange.' When I think about energy retrofitting for lighting, I see incredible projects like the one here at the Chase Center. I see the small businesses like Preferred Electric that design and install award-winning energy conservation measures that reduce the consumption of electricity and save businesses hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs. I see the master electricians and union workers who went through union apprenticeships , who start off with good wages and quality benefits that only grow from there. These investments will be a win-win-win for this country. Creating jobs. Cutting energy costsbills. Protecting our climate. That's why today I'm releasing my plan to mobilize millions of jobs by building sustainable infrastructure and an equitable clean energy future. In my first four years, we're going to give 4 million buildings all across the country the same energy make-over that the Chase Center got. It's going to create at least one million jobs in construction, engineering and manufacturing to get it done. It's going to make the places where we live, work, and learn healthier, improving indoor air quality and water quality, and it's going to save tens of billions of dollars of energy costs over time. But we're not just going to focus on commercial space, we're going to give direct support to help families do the same thing for their homes. We're going offer cash rebates and low-cost financing to upgrade energy inefficient appliances and windows , improvements that will also cut their monthly energy bills. And we're going to make a major investment to build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that will benefit our communities three-times over: by alleviating the affordable housing crisis, by increasing energy efficiency, and by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to home ownership. Last week I talked about using the purchasing power of the federal government to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing , that's what we're going to do with the American auto industry as well. The United States owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles , and we're going to convert those government fleets to electric vehicles , made and sourced right here in the United States of America. With the government providing the demand and the grants to re-tool factories that are struggling to compete, the U.S. auto industry and its deep bench of suppliers will step up , expanding capacity so that the United States , not China , leads the world in clean vehicle production. And we're going to make it easier for American consumers to switch to electric vehicles too. Not only by building those 500,000 charging stations, but by offering rebates and incentives to swap older, fuel inefficient vehicles for new, clean, American-made models, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil annually. Together, this will mean one million good new jobs in the American auto industry, its supply chains, and the associated infrastructure. We also know that transforming the American electricity sector to produce power without also producing carbon pollution , and electrifying an increasing share of our economy , will be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century. That's why we are going to achieve a carbon-pollution free electricity sector by 2035. And we need to get to work right away. We'll need scientists at national labs and land-grant universities and HBCUs to improve and innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean electricity. We'll need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them. We'll need iron workers and welders to install them. And we'll become the world's largest exporter of these technologies, creating even more jobs. We know how to do this. Our administration rescued the auto industry and helped them retool, made solar energy the same cost as traditional energy, weatherized more than a million homes , and we will do it again , bigger and faster and smarter. And, as we do this work, we need to be mindful of the historic wrongs and the damage that America's industrial rise in the 20th century inflicted on the environment in poor and vulnerable communities , so often Black, Brown, and Native American communities. Polluted air. Polluted water. Toxins raining down on communities that bore the environmental and health burdens, but shared none of the profits. Growing up, breathing that in every day , it's poison. That's partly why there are such incredible rates of childhood asthma in Black and Brown communities. Why Black Americans are almost three times more likely to die of asthma-related causes than white Americans. It's 'Cancer Alley' in St. James Parish in Louisiana. And it's the cancer clusters along Route 9 here in Delaware. And that's why, today, I'm also releasing a slate of environmental justice policies that build on my existing plan. This is an area of incredible opportunity for economic growth for our country , but we have to make sure that the first people to benefit are those who have been hurt the most by centuries of structural disparities. I'm setting a goal of making sure that these frontline and fenceline communities, whether in rural places or in city centers, receive 40 percent of the benefits from the investments we're making , in housing, in pollution reduction, in workforce development, in transportation , across the board. And we're also going to create jobs for people by cleaning up the environmental hazards that have now been abandoned. More than a quarter million jobs , right away , to do things like plug the millions of abandoned oil and gas wells that exist all across this country, posing a daily threat to the health and safety of our communities. And we're going to hold accountable those CEOs and corporations that benefited from decades of subsidies , then just walked away from their responsibilities to these communities , leaving wells to leak dangerous pollutants and greenhouse gasses into the air and water. And we're not only going to repeal those subsidies, we're going to go after those golden parachutes the CEOs gave themselves before declaring bankruptcy, and make sure workers receive the benefits and retirements they were promised. Let's create new markets for our family farmers and ranchers , and a new, modern day Civilian Climate Corps to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. These aren't pie-in-the-sky dreams. They're actionable policies that we can get to work on right away.

They undermine the vote and the voice of every U.S. citizen. They attack our very way of life. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has concluded that the Kremlin's interference in past elections represented \"only the latest installment in an increasingly brazen interference by the Kremlin on the citizens and democratic institutions of the United States.\" Despite the exposure of Russia's malign activities by the U.S. Intelligence Community, law enforcement agencies, and bipartisan Congressional committees, the Kremlin has not halted its efforts to interfere in our democracy. In Senate testimony on July 23 2019, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that Russia was \"absolutely intent on trying to interfere with our elections.\" And on March 27, 2020, the State Department held a briefing describing how Russia was recklessly spreading disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. Russia is not the only foreign actor seeking to interfere in our democracy. Increasingly, other states have shown an interest in copying Russia's tactics. Congress passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017. The Trump administration has thus far failed to make adequate use of these authorities to counter and deter foreign election interference. Instead, President Trump has repeatedly denied that Russia interfered in our elections, most egregiously during a joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on July 16, 2018. In spite of President Trump's failure to act, America's adversaries must not misjudge the resolve of the American people to counter every effort by a foreign power to interfere in our democracy, whether by hacking voting systems and databases, laundering money into our political system, systematically spreading disinformation, or trying to sow doubt about the integrity of our elections. That is why, today, I am putting the Kremlin and other foreign governments on notice.

I will direct the U.S. Intelligence Community to report publicly and in a timely manner on any efforts by foreign governments that have interfered, or attempted to interfere, with U.S. elections. I will direct my administration to leverage all appropriate instruments of national power and make full use of my executive authority to impose substantial and lasting costs on state perpetrators. These costs could include financial-sector sanctions, asset freezes, cyber responses, and the exposure of corruption. A range of other actions could also be taken, depending on the nature of the attack. I will direct our response at a time and in a manner of our choosing. In addition, I will take action where needed to stop attempts to interfere with U.S. elections before they can impact our democratic processes. In particular, I will direct and resource the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Foreign Interference Task Force to develop plans for disrupting foreign threats to our elections process. This will be done, wherever possible, in coordination with our allies and partners, so that we are isolating the regimes that seek to undermine democracies and civil liberties. I have no desire to escalate tensions with Russia or any other country. I would prefer to focus the full energies of my administration on bringing the international community together to fight COVID-19 and the economic pain it has caused, and to tackle other pressing issues of international concern.

And we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators. Good afternoon. I want to thank the Colonial Early Education Program here at the Colwyck Center for hosting us. I just met with Sarah Johnson, and her 3-year-old son, Noah, who is a student here. She said the program does wonders, helping Noah learn his letters and numbers, socialize with other kids, and understand his emotions and develop his personality. But like so many parents, she's worried. About her job as a dental assistant, and noticing changes in Noah's behavior since he hasn't been in school since March. She has had to lean on her parents to help. It's really tough. But parents like Sarah, and places like this center, and the caregivers and educators who work here , they also give me a lot of hope. That's why I couldn't think of a better place to talk about the third plank of my Build Back Better plan for our economy. This one is about easing the squeeze on working families that are raising their kids and caring for aging loved ones. And it's about creating jobs with better pay and career pathways for caregivers, and showing them the dignity and respect they deserve. But I know it's hard to think of that future when you're just trying to get through the crisis at hand. I know that's the case for child care facilities across the country. They've had to close their doors and layoff staff. They're not getting the protective equipment they need as they reopen. In virus hotspots, they can't reopen at all. We are in a child care emergency. It didn't have to be this way. That's why I'm calling on the President to get these facilities the resources and equipment they need , now. Enough. Each day the pandemic's death toll grows. Each day, in some states, more people test positive than the day before. Each day too many Americans are still out of work, losing hope. It's been reported by his own staff that the President is \"not really working this anymore. He doesn't want to be distracted by it.\" His own staff admits that Donald Trump fails the most important test of being the American President: the duty to care , for you, for all of us. It's also been reported that he will block any funding for more testing and tracing in the next COVID-relief bill , just as states report record cases, and hospitalizations and deaths continue to rise. He simply doesn't understand. We can't deal with our economic crisis without solving the public health crisis. And for all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help the working families hit the hardest. He has quit on you and he has quit on this country. But this election is not just about him. It's about us. It's about you. And I will do what a President is supposed to do. Care. Lead. And never give up. Over the last two weeks I've shared my agenda for economic recovery. I call it Build Back Better, because we can't just build back to the way things were before. The first plank rejects the defeatist view that automation and globalization mean we can't ensure American workers lead us to a future Made in America. The second plank helps us outcompete the rest of the world and tackle climate change. It will put millions of Americans to work in good union jobs, modernizing our infrastructure while building a clean energy future. Today, I'm outlining the third plank , mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in this country. If we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying. And we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators. Even before the pandemic, millions of working families have faced enormous financial and personal strains trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability. It's the sandwich generation that includes everyone from an 18-year-old daughter caring for her mother who suddenly gets sick, to a 40-year-old Dad raising his child and caring for his own aging parents. The joy and love are always there. But it's hard. It's really, really hard. Families are squeezed emotionally and financially. They need help, but often can't find it or afford it. And the professional caregivers out there , home health workers, child care workers , who are more often women, women of color, and immigrants , are too often underpaid, unseen, and undervalued. Then the pandemic hits and the squeeze tightens for everyone. Nursing homes have been hit hard. If you're a frontline worker, you struggle to find safe child care for your kids. Others of you have become unexpected 24\/7 caregivers, trying to keep your children safe and learning, while you're working remotely yourself. Or you've had to put your career on hold indefinitely, or seen your hours cut, or your job lost. The confusion over schools reopening only makes things worse. And the last few months has only underscored how vital it is for families and older Americans to have more home and community care choices that best fit their needs. We are trapped in a caregiving crisis within an economic crisis within a public health crisis. You're doing everything you can, but this President is not. If I'm your president, here's what I would do. First, let's start with caring for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities and helping them live independently. Here's an example. Right now there are 800,000 people who are eligible for home and community care through Medicaid and who have signed up for it. But they are all waiting for that phone call back. For some, the wait is five years. Five years. My plan makes a bold investment so that states can clear that waiting list. And to make sure we ease the financial burden for more families going forward, we will make long-term federal investments. We will have a major innovation fund to allow states to test and expand successful ways that improve home and community care, increase prevention, and reduce costs and hospitalizations. Think of expanded vital services like rides to appointments, meals and day programs for seniors, and making their homes safer for them. This builds on an initiative we created under the Affordable Care Act. The very program that this President ceaselessly tries to gut. For example, there's a pilot program in 27 cities in 16 states where a nurse, occupational therapist, and a handyman come to a home that's caring for an aging family member. They might not be able to cure a mother's Alzheimer's, but they can make sure she doesn't break her hip. They walk through the house and install the handrail in the right spot in the bathroom, or fix the door so it doesn't stick as she tries to open it. An initial trial found that about $3,000 in program costs yielded more than $20,000 in savings. Simple steps that save lives, save money, and provide critical peace of mind. Here's another example. Whether in rural North Carolina or central Philadelphia, people of color in economically distressed communities face punishing health disparities from systemic discrimination. They don't have health insurance. They don't see a doctor. Language is a barrier. They slip through the gaps so their treatable condition turns into a chronic condition. That's why community health workers are real heroes. They go into these communities and make sure folks are getting the care they need. My plan puts 150,000 more of these workers in our communities throughout the country. These are things we can do now. Second, we can also make high-quality child care more affordable and accessible. My child care plan is straightforward. Every 3- and 4-year-old child will get access to free, high-quality preschool like students have at this center. And low-to middle-income families won't spend more than 7% of their income on child care for children under age 5. The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime. Here's how it works. They can either get up to an $8,000 tax credit for child care. For a middle-class family with a couple of young kids spending about $300 a week on child care, that means annual tax savings of $8,000 in their pocket. That means everything to working parents living paycheck to paycheck. Or the federal government would send funding to states, which then work with child care providers to cover the costs for working families with young children over 7% of their income. So, say both parents work and need child care. You go to childcare.gov, which we created under the Obama-Biden Administration, to help you find child care that works for you. Under my plan, it takes you to your state website. Local child centers pop up. You can call or fill in your information. You apply. The state then sends you a letter saying that you're approved and lays out the amount you're going to pay. The state sends that information to the child care provider. And then the state reimburses that child care center on the back end. You just pay what you're supposed to pay , not a dime for some working families and no more than 7% for others. We can do that. This would save families thousands of dollars. And there are other common-sense steps we can take, like expanding a tax credit for businesses to build child care facilities on site, or supporting more after-care, weekend, and summer care for families. Third, as we expand access to caregiving, we need to pay and support our caregivers. They do God's work, but home health workers aren't paid much. They have few benefits. Forty-percent are still on SNAP or Medicaid. So my plan is direct. It gives caregivers and early childhood educators a much needed raise. No one should have to work more than one job to make ends meet. Under my health care plan that defends and expands Obamacare, they will have more affordable health insurance. I will make sure these workers have an effective way to unionize and collectively bargain to protect their rights and earned benefits. This plan will help workers, especially those without a college degree, gain new skills in good-paying industries like health care, and provide new pathways to advance their careers. For example, a home health worker can access the training needed to become an EMT, a nurse, a physician's assistant, or a doctor. Or an early childhood educator can receive the coaching to keep delivering high-quality learning experiences. We can do this. The bottom line is that a mobilized caregiving and early education workforce would: save working families time and money, get their loved ones the care and early childhood education they need, and put more people to work. It's a triple win. That keeps seniors in their homes if they choose. That recognizes the realities facing modern families , and provides them much-needed economic support in the middle of a pandemic. Just imagine. We can put 3 million Americans to work in new care and early childhood education jobs. And combined with my proposal to provide families with up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, we can free up millions more people to join the paid labor force. Meaning at least 2 million additional jobs and more economic growth for our nation. This is a fresh, bold way to build up a critical part of our labor force and help us recover faster and stronger. When we usually talk about a jobs package, there is a big push for shovel-ready jobs. But that's what care jobs are. These workers are ready now. These jobs can be filled now. Allowing millions of people, primarily women, to get back to work now. It is the right thing to do for our families and our most essential workers. And it is the smart thing to do for our economy. Today, millions of our people can't fully pursue the jobs and careers they dream of due to our caregiving squeeze. That means tens of billions of dollars less in wages each year for our families. It means more disruption for our businesses, and less jobs and growth for our economy. This is both a moral and an economic imperative for our nation. And we pay for it by rolling back unproductive tax cuts for high-income real estate investors while ensuring high-income earners pay their tax bills. We invest those savings of $775 billion over ten years into building our economy back better than before. And tomorrow, I'll be joining a virtual townhall with SEIU members , home care workers, fast food workers, janitors , to hear directly from them about why this matters so much. Because, you see, this is also about something bigger. It's about the dignity and respect for working people. And that's precisely what this election is about, too. The American President has a duty to care for us all. To see people where they are. To understand what they're going through and where they want to be. I've been a single parent. Even though I had a lot more support than a lot of folks going through tough times, I know how hard it is. So very, very hard. When Jill and I got married, I saw how difficult it was for her to start her teaching career while being a new mom. We cared for our parents to the end, my mom moved in with us. Our entire family was there for our Beau when he died from cancer. We know what so many of you are going through. But now everything just feels different. There's just that feeling, that sense where you just don't know if everything will be okay. But I'm here to tell you that it can be , it will be. You know, my Dad was an honorable, decent man. He never went to college. He got knocked down a few times, but always got up. He worked hard and built a great middle-class life for our family. He used to say, \"Joey, I don't expect the government to solve my problems, but I expect them to understand my problems.\" I understand , to my very core. And I know that together, we can do this. We are America. We don't settle. We aspire. Let's get to work.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1461584\/were-going-to-create-a-21-st-century-care-and-early-childhood-education-workforce&speechType=1","Summary":"Employment and Affirmative Action Taxes Health and Health Care Education","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/joebiden.com\/2020\/07\/21\/were-going-to-create-a-21st-century-care-and-early-childhood-education-workforce\/","CleanText":"If we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying. And we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators. Good afternoon. I want to thank the Colonial Early Education Program here at the Colwyck Center for hosting us. I just met with Sarah Johnson, and her 3-year-old son, Noah, who is a student here. She said the program does wonders, helping Noah learn his letters and numbers, socialize with other kids, and understand his emotions and develop his personality. But like so many parents, she's worried. About her job as a dental assistant, and noticing changes in Noah's behavior since he hasn't been in school since March. She has had to lean on her parents to help. It's really tough. But parents like Sarah, and places like this center, and the caregivers and educators who work here , they also give me a lot of hope. That's why I couldn't think of a better place to talk about the third plank of my Build Back Better plan for our economy. This one is about easing the squeeze on working families that are raising their kids and caring for aging loved ones. And it's about creating jobs with better pay and career pathways for caregivers, and showing them the dignity and respect they deserve. But I know it's hard to think of that future when you're just trying to get through the crisis at hand. I know that's the case for child care facilities across the country. They've had to close their doors and layoff staff. They're not getting the protective equipment they need as they reopen. In virus hotspots, they can't reopen at all. We are in a child care emergency. It didn't have to be this way. That's why I'm calling on the President to get these facilities the resources and equipment they need , now. Enough. Each day the pandemic's death toll grows. Each day, in some states, more people test positive than the day before. Each day too many Americans are still out of work, losing hope. It's been reported by his own staff that the President is 'not really working this anymore. He doesn't want to be distracted by it.' His own staff admits that Donald Trump fails the most important test of being the American President: the duty to care , for you, for all of us. It's also been reported that he will block any funding for more testing and tracing in the next COVID-relief bill , just as states report record cases, and hospitalizations and deaths continue to rise. He simply doesn't understand. We can't deal with our economic crisis without solving the public health crisis. And for all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help the working families hit the hardest. He has quit on you and he has quit on this country. But this election is not just about him. It's about us. It's about you. And I will do what a President is supposed to do. Care. Lead. And never give up. Over the last two weeks I've shared my agenda for economic recovery. I call it Build Back Better, because we can't just build back to the way things were before. The first plank rejects the defeatist view that automation and globalization mean we can't ensure American workers lead us to a future Made in America. The second plank helps us outcompete the rest of the world and tackle climate change. It will put millions of Americans to work in good union jobs, modernizing our infrastructure while building a clean energy future. Today, I'm outlining the third plank , mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in this country. If we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying. And we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators. Even before the pandemic, millions of working families have faced enormous financial and personal strains trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability. It's the sandwich generation that includes everyone from an 18-year-old daughter caring for her mother who suddenly gets sick, to a 40-year-old Dad raising his child and caring for his own aging parents. The joy and love are always there. But it's hard. It's really, really hard. Families are squeezed emotionally and financially. They need help, but often can't find it or afford it. And the professional caregivers out there , home health workers, child care workers , who are more often women, women of color, and immigrants , are too often underpaid, unseen, and undervalued. Then the pandemic hits and the squeeze tightens for everyone. Nursing homes have been hit hard. If you're a frontline worker, you struggle to find safe child care for your kids. Others of you have become unexpected 24\/7 caregivers, trying to keep your children safe and learning, while you're working remotely yourself. Or you've had to put your career on hold indefinitely, or seen your hours cut, or your job lost. The confusion over schools reopening only makes things worse. And the last few months has only underscored how vital it is for families and older Americans to have more home and community care choices that best fit their needs. We are trapped in a caregiving crisis within an economic crisis within a public health crisis. You're doing everything you can, but this President is not. If I'm your president, here's what I would do. First, let's start with caring for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities and helping them live independently. Here's an example. Right now there are 800,000 people who are eligible for home and community care through Medicaid and who have signed up for it. But they are all waiting for that phone call back. For some, the wait is five years. Five years. My plan makes a bold investment so that states can clear that waiting list. And to make sure we ease the financial burden for more families going forward, we will make long-term federal investments. We will have a major innovation fund to allow states to test and expand successful ways that improve home and community care, increase prevention, and reduce costs and hospitalizations. Think of expanded vital services like rides to appointments, meals and day programs for seniors, and making their homes safer for them. This builds on an initiative we created under the Affordable Care Act. The very program that this President ceaselessly tries to gut.

We need to ensure that every American has the chance to live independently, contribute their talents to our society, and go through life free from the burden of discriminatory systems and practices. I look forward to working together with the disability community to bring us closer to those goals , and finally deliver on the promise of the ADA. Thirty years ago today, our nation moved closer to the fulfillment of its foundational promise by passing the Americans with Disabilities Act. For the estimated 61 million Americans now living with a disability, the ADA has been a critical source of opportunity, participation, self-sufficiency, and respect , a triumph of American civil rights. I will never forget the leadership and persistence of my friends, Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Ted Kennedy, Congressman Major Owens, and Congressman Tony Coelho, who teamed up to create the ADA against long odds and determined opposition. Nor will I forget the moment just after it passed, when Senator Harkin delivered a speech from the Senate floor in American Sign Language as a tribute to his older brother, Frank, who was deaf. For tens of millions of American families, this work could not be more personal. I was immensely proud to cosponsor the ADA, which was forged through fearless advocacy and tough bipartisan negotiations , a Democratic bill signed by George H.W. Bush, a Republican President. It rose above the foundation laid by other landmark laws I had the honor of helping to pass, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975, and the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988. And its legacy was furthered by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which finally barred health insurers from instituting lifetime caps on benefits , and denying coverage altogether , for Americans living with disabilities. Today, President Trump threatens that progress, consistently disparaging Americans with disabilities with his rhetoric and actions. His administration has attempted to undermine the ADA by making it harder for Americans with disabilities to exercise their civil rights by filing claims. And he has repeatedly tried to gut Medicaid and repeal the Affordable Care Act , two of the most important safeguards of the health and independence of Americans with disabilities. If I have the honor of becoming President, every policy I pursue , from rebuilding our middle class, to fighting climate change, to achieving universal health coverage , will be created with the full inclusion and dignity of Americans with disabilities in mind. As we seek to recover from a devastating public health crisis that is disproportionately impacting people with disabilities, it is more important than ever that we fulfill the promise of the ADA and build a more equal and inclusive society.

We will make bold investments in home and community care through Medicaid to help states clear the backlog of 800,000 people who need support, but can't get it. We will give a major, long-overdue raise to the direct care workforce. And we will guarantee access to high quality, affordable health care , including mental health care , for every American. My plan also eliminates employment barriers for workers with disabilities , phasing out the subminimum wage and creating new job opportunities for Americans with disabilities. We will fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, invest in accessible child care, and provide federal support to ease students with disabilities' transitions from high school to higher education and employment opportunities. And we will invest in accessible, affordable, and integrated housing and transportation; eliminate the Supplemental Security Income marriage penalty and other provisions that prevent Americans with disabilities from achieving economic security; and use every tool of American diplomacy to advance disability rights on a global scale. Finally , and most urgently , we will take immediate steps to support Americans with disabilities grappling with the coronavirus pandemic: outlawing the rationing of scarce medical resources based on a patient's disability; aggressively enforcing non-discrimination laws; making sure that people living in the community have access to PPE when it is most critically needed; expanding remote mental health and food and medicine delivery programs; launching an emergency paid leave program; and investing in accessible technology to meet the needs of students with disabilities.

Thank you, Wayne Jefferson, and everyone at the Hicks center for hosting us. You and your staff do God's work. This community center gives people hope and a place to belong. I saw that hope as a Senator. And when he was Attorney General of Delaware, my son Beau would attend mass at Sacred Heart and then walk here to listen, notebook in his pocket, and find ways to help. It's on the East Side, where I was a lifeguard at the local pool as a teenager, where I started my career as a public defender. And this center is named after my friend, William \"Hicks\" Anderson. Hicks and I went way back. Walk around Wilmington and everyone has a story about him. How he cared. How he was always there for you. How he built a wonderful family, including his twin sons Al and Nnamdi, who give back so much to this community They served in the United States Army. They now jointly serve as poet laureates of the State of Delaware. Nnamdi is now a State Representative. Hicks, his family, and everyone at this center, embody the defining story of America. For generations, Americans who are Black, Brown, Native American, immigrant, haven't always been fully included in our democracy or our economy. But by pure courage, heart and gut, they never give up as they pursue the full promise of America. That's the story of the people of this community and of this country. That's why I couldn't think of a more meaningful place to talk about my Build Back Better economic agenda. A bold, practical plan that will help build a stronger, more just, more sustainable economy where everyone is included in the deal. And it's the story of two civil rights heroes we lost last week , and who show us the way forward. The Reverend C.T. Vivian, who faced down drownings and beatings to say \"You cannot turn your back upon the idea of justice.\" And my friend, an American hero, Congressman John Lewis, who crossed the Edmund Pettus bridge one last time on Sunday, and who once said \"freedom is not a state, it is an act.\" When I spoke to John just before he died, instead of answering my concerns for him,he asked about me, about us. He asked that we stay focused on the work left undone to heal this nation. To remain undaunted by the public health crisis and the economic crisis that has taken the blinders off the crisis of systemic racism that still plagues this nation. One thing the Senate and this President can do right away is pass the bill to restore the Voting Rights Act , just yesterday renamed in memory of John Lewis. Back the effusive praise we've heard since he passed, especially from our Republican friends, with action. Protect the sacred right to vote that he was willing to die for. If they don't, it will be one of the first things I do as President. We cannot let that fundamental right to vote be denied, especially in the middle of a pandemic that rages on. Nearly 150,000 Americans are now dead from Covid-19, and counting. More than 4 million Americans have tested positive, and counting. Black and Latino people have been three times as likely to be infected , and two times as likely to die from the virus as white people. More than 30 Million people are collecting unemployment checks. Black unemployment is at 15%, Latino unemployment is at 14.5%. Over 40% of black-owned businesses , 440,000 in total , reportedly had to shut down. And everything is worsened by the crisis of presidential leadership. A change of \"tone\" over a few days does not change the facts of the last four years. Donald Trump fails the basic threshold test of being president , the duty to care about the entire country, not just himself. He has shown that he can't beat the pandemic to keep you safe. He can't turn the economy around to get Americans back to work. And he is , horrifyingly, but not surprisingly , intentionally stoking the flames of division in this country. I've said from the outset of the recent protests that there is no place for violence or the destruction of property. Peaceful protesters should be protected , but arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted , and local law enforcement can do that. When President Obama and I were in office we protected federal property. And we were able to do it without turning DHS into a private militia. That could be done today. But that wouldn't help Trump's political interests. He is determined to stoke division and chaos. It's not good for the country , but Trump doesn't care. His campaign is failing and he's looking for a political lifeline. This isn't about law and order. This is a political strategy to revive a failing campaign. Every instinct Trump has is to add fuel to any fire. And it's the last thing we need. We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature. That's how we'll restore peace to the streets. But this election is not just about voting against Donald Trump. It's about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people's struggle, and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome. Last month, I stopped by Bethel AME Church here in Wilmington. I talked with a group of faith and local leaders. They shared their pain, anger, and frustration at the state of affairs , in our justice system, our politics, our economy. There's just that sense the deck is stacked. The common theme was how do we break the cycle , in good times, communities of color still lag, in bad times, they get hit first and the hardest and in recovery, take the longest to bounce back. It is about justice. I've proposed a criminal justice reform and policing reform agenda and I'm committed to working with the Congress to seeing it through as President. It's also about jobs. Good-paying jobs, financial stability, and building wealth for families of color and passing it down to their kids. It's about economic growth for our country, and outcompeting the world. And it's also about dignity for working people and the middle class. Over the last few weeks, I've laid out my Build Back Better plan based on those necessities and on the idea that we can't just build back to the way things were before. We have to Build Back Better. We need to make bold, practical investments , to recover from the economic mess we're in, and to rebuild for the economic future our country deserves. I've explained how these investments are paid for. Today, I'm here to explain how Build Back Better will deal with systemic racism and advance racial equity in our economy. So far, Build Back Better has had three parts. First, it's investing in American manufacturing and technology so the future is Made in America and includes all Americans. Under my plan, we will mobilize the biggest investment in rebuilding our country since World War 2, creating millions of good-paying union jobs. That includes a historic investment in federal procurement, which is the way the government purchases goods and services. Under my proposal, we would make sure those goods and services are American-made in American supply chains , like American steel for our buildings and energy efficient vehicles. But for too long, federal contracting for this work has been inaccessible for too many Black and Brown entrepreneurs and businesses. They too often never get a fair shot to apply. My plan makes sure contractors and subcontractors of color get a fair shot. We will triple the federal goal for contracting with small disadvantaged businesses from 5 percent to a minimum of 15 percent by 2025. And we will create jobs and growth along the way. We can do that. The second plank of Build Back Better advances racial equity by modernizing our infrastructure and taking on climate change with jobs. Take infrastructure, for example. In too many underserved communities of color , the roads are falling apart, street lights are out, sidewalks are cracked, school buildings are outdated. Parks aren't safe for kids to play and adults to exercise, and there's nowhere to buy fresh food for miles. Air pollution causes childhood asthma that follows them as adults, and abandoned homes crush property values and diminish the quality of life in neighborhoods. But notwithstanding these systemic barriers, look at the energy, pride, and achievement of communities of color. Imagine if we could truly unleash their full potential. My Build Back Better plan would make sure families in these communities are the ones who benefit from hundreds of billions in federal investments. To rebuild those roads, fill the sidewalk cracks, install broadband to close the digital divide, and create spaces to live, work, and play safely. Where they can drink clean water, breathe clean air, and shop at nearby grocery stores that stock fresh and healthy food. We can't rebuild our economy and meet the climate crisis unless we create opportunities for people to rebuild their own communities. This is about jobs. But it's also about dignity. It's about pride. We can do this. The third plank of Build Back Better invests in our caregivers , who take care of our aging loved ones and kids. If we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying. And we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators. Families are squeezed emotionally and financially trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability. They need help, but often can't find it or afford it. And the professional caregivers out there , home health workers, child care workers , who are more often women, women of color, and immigrants , are too often underpaid, unseen, and undervalued. But there are things we can do right now to ease the burden. My plan would help clear a waiting list of 800,000 people who are eligible for home and community care through Medicaid and who have signed up for it, but are just waiting. My plan would make sure every 3- and 4-year-old child gets access to free, high-quality preschool like students have at this center. And low- to middle-income families won't spend more than 7% of their income on child care for children under age 5. The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime. And my plan would pay and support our caregivers, who are overwhelmingly women and women of color. This plan will help workers, especially those without a college degree, gain new skills in good-paying industries like health care, and provide new pathways to advance their careers. For example, a home health worker can access the training needed to become an EMT, a nurse, a physician's assistant, or a doctor. We won't just put millions of Americans to work in new care and early childhood education jobs. We will also free up millions more people to join the paid labor force. Meaning at least 2 million additional jobs and more economic growth for our nation. We can do this. Today, I'm laying out the fourth part of Build Back Better , advancing racial equity across the American economy, not just as part of the other pillars of Build Back Better, but in its own right. To start, we will create a new Small Business Opportunity Fund. It dramatically expands an successful Obama-Biden initiative that generated more than $5 in private investment for every $1 in public investment in small businesses , particularly in hard-pressed areas. We will take $30 Billion from our Made in America investments I announced earlier and put it into this Fund. That will allow us to expand federal support for the most effective state, local, and non-profit programs that provide venture capital and financing for minority business owners and communities in need. It will also allow us to support the community development banks that have a proven record of investing in minority small businesses. That $30 billion will leverage $150 Billion in new financing and equity for more Black and Brown small businesses. So say our Small Business Opportunity Fund supports an investment in a small manufacturer of color seeking to commercialize a new technology. That helps the manufacturer get started. Then private investors notice the promise of that business and invest their private dollars too. That helps the manufacturer scale and grow. That's how we will make sure that those with the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of their race or zip code. Here's why that matters. Right now, we're in the midst of one of the greatest threats to small businesses our country has ever seen. What does Donald Trump do? Give big banks the green light to make millions of dollars in fees by favoring their most well-off and well-connected clients while shutting the door on smaller Black and Brown businesses without those connections. The result? Billions of dollars in the Covid-relief program for small businesses benefited ones who had the lawyers and accountants to help better connected businesses jump the line. Black and Brown small businesses that needed help the most got shut out. In fact, just 12% of Black and Brown businesses surveyed seeking help got the aid they asked for. Now half of them say they'll have to close up shop. Our economy can't afford for them to close. Their families can't afford for them to close. Under my plan, fifty percent of emergency small business relief would be reserved for the smallest businesses with 50 employees or fewer. This would help minority-owned businesses get life-saving loans before more well-connected businesses jump ahead in line. But removing the barriers for Black and Brown entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses is only one of many things we must do to close the racial wealth gap in our nation. Expanding black and brown homeownership is another. Today, there are American cities where about 75% of white Americans own homes, while only about 25% of their fellow Black citizens do. Even in middle class communities of color, the same homes as in white communities are often valued significantly less. Those Black residents then see their wealth accumulate more slowly. When a house is an asset that helps build equity and wealth, the homeownership disparity denies equal opportunities. My housing plan from a $15,000 first-time home-buyer tax credit to expanding affordable housing to reversing Trump's efforts to gut fair housing enforcement, will remove the barriers to homeownership that now hold back too many Americans of color on the pathway to the middle class. But we also have to remove another piece of the systemic barrier for too many Black and Brown Americans. What's holding back too many people of color , in finding a good job or starting a business , is a criminal record that follows them every step of the way. Getting caught for smoking marijuana shouldn't deny you a good-paying job and career, a loan, or ability to rent an apartment. But right now, that criminal record is the weight that holds back too many people of color. The process to seal or expunge those records can be complicated and costly. And a life of second chances passes by. Now, some safeguards are necessary, but some do more harm than good. And more and more states recognize the significant cost to their economy when people with certain nonviolent criminal records can't fully contribute their full talents and capacity. But even when those states want to give that person a second chance and seal or expunge certain nonviolent criminal records, their record keeping systems are outdated. It is paper spread across different courthouses. Under my plan, if a state decides it wants to implement an automated system for sealing or expunging certain nonviolent criminal records, the federal government will help them do that. That's what racial equity in our economy looks like. And here's another step we will take under my Build Back Better plan to fully include more people into the deal , strengthen the Federal Reserve's focus on racial economic equity. The Fed has a profound impact on our economy. Its existing mandate promotes maximum employment and stable prices. Under my plan, I believe the Fed should add to that responsibility and aggressively target persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages, wealth, and revise its hiring and employment practices to achieve greater diversity at all levels of the institution , including diverse nominees for the Board of Governors and the regional Federal Reserve Banks. So when the Chairman of the Federal Reserve provides a report on the health of the economy , we'll know if the economy is working for everyone. That's when racial equity is not just an aspiration, but a theory of change and how we build our economic future to include everyone. To include all those remarkable people out there doing extraordinary things if given just half a chance. People like Markevis Gideon, who I just met backstage. His Mom and Dad never went to college. He was 12 when he got an old laptop handed to him. He took it apart and put it back together. It changed his life. At 17, he got certified to become an IT systems specialist. He went to college. Studied abroad. Came back home to see the digital divide in his community. So he started a business getting computers to folks. He's 22 now. Married with a little baby. He also has 7 employees. His goal is to teach people how to repair and recycle computers and create a workforce development program to get them trained for good-paying IT jobs. It's incredible. And he is incredible. Some of the people he's helped only had an 8th grade education. Never used a computer before. Five weeks later, they know how. Some are now earning $15\/hr for the first time. They are incredible. Markevis wants to scale his business and continue reinvesting in the people of this community. That's pure courage, heart, and gut. He never gives up in pursuit of the full promise of America. That's who we are. That's what this election is about. We are America. We don't settle. We aspire. We succeed. Thank you.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1461557\/remarks-from-joe-biden-on-racial-economic-equity&speechType=1","Summary":"Health and Health Care Economy and Fiscal Business, Consumers, and Employees","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/joebiden.com\/2020\/07\/28\/remarks-on-racial-economic-equity\/","CleanText":"Racial equity is not just an aspiration, but a theory of change and how we build our economic future to include everyone. Thank you, Wayne Jefferson, and everyone at the Hicks center for hosting us. You and your staff do God's work. This community center gives people hope and a place to belong. I saw that hope as a Senator. And when he was Attorney General of Delaware, my son Beau would attend mass at Sacred Heart and then walk here to listen, notebook in his pocket, and find ways to help. It's on the East Side, where I was a lifeguard at the local pool as a teenager, where I started my career as a public defender. And this center is named after my friend, William 'Hicks' Anderson. Hicks and I went way back. Walk around Wilmington and everyone has a story about him. How he cared. How he was always there for you. How he built a wonderful family, including his twin sons Al and Nnamdi, who give back so much to this community They served in the United States Army. They now jointly serve as poet laureates of the State of Delaware. Nnamdi is now a State Representative. Hicks, his family, and everyone at this center, embody the defining story of America. For generations, Americans who are Black, Brown, Native American, immigrant, haven't always been fully included in our democracy or our economy. But by pure courage, heart and gut, they never give up as they pursue the full promise of America. That's the story of the people of this community and of this country. That's why I couldn't think of a more meaningful place to talk about my Build Back Better economic agenda. A bold, practical plan that will help build a stronger, more just, more sustainable economy where everyone is included in the deal. And it's the story of two civil rights heroes we lost last week , and who show us the way forward. The Reverend C.T. Vivian, who faced down drownings and beatings to say 'You cannot turn your back upon the idea of justice.' And my friend, an American hero, Congressman John Lewis, who crossed the Edmund Pettus bridge one last time on Sunday, and who once said 'freedom is not a state, it is an act.' When I spoke to John just before he died, instead of answering my concerns for him,he asked about me, about us. He asked that we stay focused on the work left undone to heal this nation. To remain undaunted by the public health crisis and the economic crisis that has taken the blinders off the crisis of systemic racism that still plagues this nation. One thing the Senate and this President can do right away is pass the bill to restore the Voting Rights Act , just yesterday renamed in memory of John Lewis.

Nearly a third of all current DACA recipients are essential workers helping our communities respond to the pandemic. Close to 30,000 of them are front-line health care workers. This November, voters must reject the politics that play with the lives of immigrant young people and jeopardize public health to divide families and rip apart communities. As President, I will protect Dreamers and their families and offer a roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and all 11 million undocumented immigrants enriching our country, so they no longer have to live in fear and uncertainty.

Trump's actions would upend the lives of hundreds of thousands of our neighbors, teachers, nurses, doctors, engineers and lawyers, among others. It's wrong, and it's un-American. The America I know fights for our own and that's exactly who DACA recipients are , our own. It's unconscionable that the Trump Administration has continued its attacks on DACA recipients, especially while our country is battling COVID-19 and many of these young people are risking their lives to keep us safe and healthy. Nearly a third of all current DACA recipients are essential workers helping our communities respond to the pandemic. Close to 30,000 of them are front-line health care workers. This November, voters must reject the politics that play with the lives of immigrant young people and jeopardize public health to divide families and rip apart communities. As President, I will protect Dreamers and their families and offer a roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and all 11 million undocumented immigrants enriching our country, so they no longer have to live in fear and uncertainty. In a Biden Administration, Dreamers can make plans to prosper and thrive here in America, right where they belong."}

On March 7, 1965, John Lewis and hundreds of brave and righteous souls risked their lives to cross a bridge in Selma named after a Klansman to reach the other side of justice.

But Republicans at every level chipped away at it with restrictive voting laws under the false flag of \"voter fraud.\" And in 2013 the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, holding that times have changed and blatant voter discrimination was rare, contrary to the assault on the ground.

He is putting Social Security at grave risk at a time when seniors are suffering the overwhelming impact of a pandemic he has failed to get under control. And make no mistake: Donald Trump said today that if he is re-elected, he will defund Social Security. For months, Trump has golfed rather than negotiated, and sown division rather than pull people together to get a package passed. Now, instead of staying in Washington and working with Republicans and Democrats to reach a bipartisan deal, President Trump is at his golf club in New Jersey signing a series of dubious executive orders. This is no art of the deal. This is not presidential leadership. These orders are not real solutions. They are just another cynical ploy designed to deflect responsibility. Some measures do far more harm than good. One order is Donald Trump's first shot in a new, reckless war on Social Security. Trump announced a payroll tax plan with no protections or guarantees , like the ones the Obama-Biden administration enforced a decade ago , that the Social Security Trust Fund will be made whole. And, Trump specifically stated today that if re-elected, he plans to undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security. He is laying out his roadmap to cutting Social Security. Our seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without Trump putting their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt. Another order brings cuts, chaos, and confusion to our system of unemployment insurance. Trump is unilaterally reducing the amount laid-off workers could receive. And he purports to provide these benefits until the end of the year, but only identifies enough funding to make it a handful of weeks. Even with that limited funding, Trump is basically playing a cruel game of robbing Peter to pay Paul: He is taking billions of dollars of federal natural disaster funding away so it won't be available to states like Florida. And, he is forcing states to choose between imposing benefit cuts for unemployed workers or slashing funds for public schools, health workers, and first responders. A third order, on evictions, is woefully inadequate to deal with the emerging housing crisis. He is leaving our nation's renters with ever-mounting debt and leaving our small family landlords badly squeezed. Without a comprehensive plan to help our American families make rent, they will leave this crisis months behind on their payments while many landlords teeter on the verge of bankruptcy. And a fourth order is a band-aid approach to student debt that leaves out 7 million borrowers who obtained their federal loans from private lenders or their college rather than the Department. The economic strain on these Americans is deep and unrelenting. There is a solution to all of this pain and suffering. A real leader would go back to Washington, call together the leaders of the House and Senate, and negotiate a deal that delivers real relief to Americans who are struggling in this pandemic.

In 2010, Kamala became the first Black woman to be elected California Attorney General, overseeing the country's second largest Justice Department, only behind the U.S. Department of Justice. In this capacity, she managed a $735 million budget and oversaw more than 4,800 attorneys and other employees. As California Attorney General, Kamala fought for families and won a $20 billion settlement for California homeowners against big banks that were unfairly foreclosing on homes. Kamala worked to protect Obamacare, helped win marriage equality for all, defended California's landmark climate change law and won a $1.1 billion settlement against a for-profit education company that scammed students and veterans. Kamala also fought for California communities and prosecuted transnational gangs who drove human trafficking, gun smuggling and drug rings. Since being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016, Kamala has introduced and co-sponsored legislation to help the middle class, increase the minimum wage to $15, reform cash bail, and defend the legal rights of refugees and immigrants.

Over the course of their lives, it's impossible for Black women to ever really catch up. There are workplace practices that make it impossible for a server working double shifts at $2.13\/hour and living off tips to ever earn a stable living wage. There is flatout discrimination that denies her the promotion she has clearly earned and deserves. There are workplace cultures full of daily slights and biases that make others feel comfortable questioning whether she's good enough to be hired. And, then there are four years of Donald Trump's assault on worker rights and his massive failure over the last six months to manage the pandemic and economic freefall that has hit Black families the hardest. Today is a day to raise awareness of how far we are from the full promise of America for all Americans. But it's also a day to remember we are less than three months away from an election where we can do something about it. In a Joe Biden-Kamala Harris Administration, Black women's equal pay will be a top priority, not just an afterthought. We will contain the virus and get people back to work, school, and their everyday lives. We will get them the support they need to come back from the edge. And, we will build back better with an economy that advances racial equity and breaks down barriers that have left so many women, especially Black women, unseen, underpaid, and undervalued. We will champion Black women.

Over the course of their lives, it's impossible for Black women to ever really catch up. There are workplace practices that make it impossible for a server working double shifts at $2.13\/hour and living off tips to ever earn a stable living wage. There is flatout discrimination that denies her the promotion she has clearly earned and deserves. There are workplace cultures full of daily slights and biases that make others feel comfortable questioning whether she's good enough to be hired. And, then there are four years of Donald Trump's assault on worker rights and his massive failure over the last six months to manage the pandemic and economic freefall that has hit Black families the hardest. Today is a day to raise awareness of how far we are from the full promise of America for all Americans. But it's also a day to remember we are less than three months away from an election where we can do something about it. In a Joe Biden-Kamala Harris Administration, Black women's equal pay will be a top priority, not just an afterthought. We will contain the virus and get people back to work, school, and their everyday lives. We will get them the support they need to come back from the edge. And, we will build back better with an economy that advances racial equity and breaks down barriers that have left so many women, especially Black women, unseen, underpaid, and undervalued. We will champion Black women. We will move closer to equal pay , by holding employers accountable, making wage gaps more transparent, banning salary history to set future wages, and easing the ability for workers to organize and bargain collectively. We will build back better because Black women are the backbones of their families, communities, our economy, and our country.

We spoke to him a few days ago for the final time. His voice still commanded respect and his laugh was still full of joy. Instead of answering our concerns for him, he asked about us. He asked us to stay focused on the work left undone to heal this nation. He was himself , a man at peace, of dignity, grace and character.

The past six months have proven again and again that it's Donald Trump who doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to COVID-19. He said the virus would disappear.

But what's truly disturbing is that President Trump isn't just attacking our leading health experts , he's waving the white flag and actively undercutting our ability to save lives and stop COVID-19 by shamefully trying to block critical additional new funding for the CDC, as well as for testing and tracing. Think about that again: In the middle of a pandemic that continues to worsen on his watch, President Trump is trying to keep money away from the public health measures that we know will keep us and our families safe.

Too much anger. Too much fear. Too much division.Here and now, I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us not the worst. I will be an ally of the light not of the darkness.It's time for us, for We the People, to come together.For make no mistake. United we can, and will, overcome this season of darkness in America. We will choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege.I am a proud Democrat and I will be proud to carry the banner of our party into the general election. So, it is with great honor and humility that I accept this nomination for President of the United States of America.But while I will be a Democratic candidate, I will be an American president. I will work as hard for those who didn't support me as I will for those who did.That's the job of a president. To represent all of us, not just our base or our party. This is not a partisan moment. This must be an American moment.It's a moment that calls for hope and light and love. Hope for our futures, light to see our way forward, and love for one another.America isn't just a collection of clashing interests of Red States or Blue States.We're so much bigger than that.We're so much better than that.Nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt pledged a New Deal in a time of massive unemployment, uncertainty, and fear.Stricken by disease, stricken by a virus, FDR insisted that he would recover and prevail and he believed America could as well.And he did.And so can we.This campaign isn't just about winning votes.It's about winning the heart, and yes, the soul of America.Winning it for the generous among us, not the selfish. Winning it for the workers who keep this country going, not just the privileged few at the top. Winning it for those communities who have known the injustice of the \"knee on the neck\". For all the young people who have known only an America of rising inequity and shrinking opportunity.They deserve to experience America's promise in full.No generation ever knows what history will ask of it. All we can ever know is whether we'll be ready when that moment arrives.And now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments America has ever faced.Four historic crises. All at the same time. A perfect storm.The worst pandemic in over 100 years. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.The most compelling call for racial justice since the 60's. And the undeniable realities and accelerating threats of climate change.So, the question for us is simple: Are we ready?I believe we are.We must be.All elections are important. But we know in our bones this one is more consequential.America is at an inflection point. A time of real peril, but of extraordinary possibilities.We can choose the path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, and more divided.A path of shadow and suspicion.Or we can choose a different path, and together, take this chance to heal, to be reborn, to unite. A path of hope and light.This is a life-changing election that will determine America's future for a very long time.Character is on the ballot. Compassion is on the ballot. Decency, science, democracy.They are all on the ballot.Who we are as a nation. What we stand for. And, most importantly, who we want to be.That's all on the ballot.And the choice could not be clearer.No rhetoric is needed.Just judge this president on the facts.5 million Americans infected with COVID-19.More than 170,000 Americans have died.By far the worst performance of any nation on Earth.More than 50 million people have filed for unemployment this year.More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year.Nearly one in 6 small businesses have closed this year.If this president is re-elected we know what will happen.Cases and deaths will remain far too high.More mom and pop businesses will close their doors for good.Working families will struggle to get by, and yet, the wealthiest one percent will get tens of billions of dollars in new tax breaks.And the assault on the Affordable Care Act will continue until its destroyed, taking insurance away from more than 20 million people , including more than 15 million people on Medicaid , and getting rid of the protections that President Obama and I passed for people who suffer from a pre-existing condition.And speaking of President Obama, a man I was honored to serve alongside for 8 years as Vice President. Let me take this moment to say something we don't say nearly enough.Thank you, Mr. President. You were a great president. A president our children could , and did , look up to.No one will say that about the current occupant of the office.What we know about this president is if he's given four more years he will be what he's been the last four years.A president who takes no responsibility, refuses to lead, blames others, cozies up to dictators, and fans the flames of hate and division.He will wake up every day believing the job is all about him. Never about you.Is that the America you want for you, your family, your children?I see a different America.One that is generous and strong.Selfless and humble.It's an America we can rebuild together.As president, the first step I will take will be to get control of the virus that's ruined so many lives.Because I understand something this president doesn't.We will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back to school, we will never have our lives back, until we deal with this virus.The tragedy of where we are today is it didn't have to be this bad.Just look around.It's not this bad in Canada. Or Europe. Or Japan. Or almost anywhere else in the world.The President keeps telling us the virus is going to disappear. He keeps waiting for a miracle. Well, I have news for him, no miracle is coming.We lead the world in confirmed cases. We lead the world in deaths.Our economy is in tatters, with Black, Latino, Asian American, and Native American communities bearing the brunt of it.And after all this time, the president still does not have a plan.Well, I do.If I'm president on day one we'll implement the national strategy I've been laying out since March.We'll develop and deploy rapid tests with results available immediately.We'll make the medical supplies and protective equipment our country needs. And we'll make them here in America. So we will never again be at the mercy of China and other foreign countries in order to protect our own people.We'll make sure our schools have the resources they need to be open, safe, and effective.We'll put the politics aside and take the muzzle off our experts so the public gets the information they need and deserve. The honest, unvarnished truth. They can deal with that.We'll have a national mandate to wear a mask-not as a burden, but to protect each other.It's a patriotic duty.In short, I will do what we should have done from the very beginning.Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to this nation.He failed to protect us.He failed to protect America.And, my fellow Americans, that is unforgivable.As president, I will make you this promise: I will protect America. I will defend us from every attack. Seen. And unseen. Always. Without exception. Every time.Look, I understand it's hard to have hope right now.On this summer night, let me take a moment to speak to those of you who have lost the most.I know how it feels to lose someone you love. I know that deep black hole that opens up in your chest. That you feel your whole being is sucked into it. I know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes.But I've learned two things.First, your loved ones may have left this Earth but they never leave your heart. They will always be with you.And second, I found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose.As God's children each of us have a purpose in our lives.And we have a great purpose as a nation: To open the doors of opportunity to all Americans. To save our democracy. To be a light to the world once again.To finally live up to and make real the words written in the sacred documents that founded this nation that all men and women are created equal. Endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. Among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.You know, my Dad was an honorable, decent man.He got knocked down a few times pretty hard, but always got up.He worked hard and built a great middle-class life for our family.He used to say, \"Joey, I don't expect the government to solve my problems, but I expect it to understand them.\"And then he would say: \"Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in your community. It's about looking your kids in the eye and say, honey, it's going to be okay.\"I've never forgotten those lessons.That's why my economic plan is all about jobs, dignity, respect, and community. Together, we can, and we will, rebuild our economy. And when we do, we'll not only build it back, we'll build it back better.With modern roads, bridges, highways, broadband, ports and airports as a new foundation for economic growth. With pipes that transport clean water to every community. With 5 million new manufacturing and technology jobs so the future is made in America.With a health care system that lowers premiums, deductibles, and drug prices by building on the Affordable Care Act he's trying to rip away.With an education system that trains our people for the best jobs of the 21st century, where cost doesn't prevent young people from going to college, and student debt doesn't crush them when they get out.With child care and elder care that make it possible for parents to go to work and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity. With an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values. With newly empowered labor unions. With equal pay for women. With rising wages you can raise a family on. Yes, we're going to do more than praise our essential workers. We're finally going to pay them.We can, and we will, deal with climate change. It's not only a crisis, it's an enormous opportunity. An opportunity for America to lead the world in clean energy and create millions of new good-paying jobs in the process.And we can pay for these investments by ending loopholes and the president's $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1 percent and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of which pay no tax at all.Because we don't need a tax code that rewards wealth more than it rewards work. I'm not looking to punish anyone. Far from it. But it's long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share.For our seniors, Social Security is a sacred obligation, a sacred promise made. The current president is threatening to break that promise. He's proposing to eliminate the tax that pays for almost half of Social Security without any way of making up for that lost revenue.I will not let it happen. If I'm your president, we're going to protect Social Security and Medicare. You have my word.One of the most powerful voices we hear in the country today is from our young people. They're speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in America. Economic injustice. Racial injustice. Environmental injustice.I hear their voices and if you listen, you can hear them too. And whether it's the existential threat posed by climate change, the daily fear of being gunned down in school, or the inability to get started in their first job , it will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America to everyone.I won't have to do it alone. Because I will have a great Vice President at my side. Senator Kamala Harris. She is a powerful voice for this nation. Her story is the American story. She knows about all the obstacles thrown in the way of so many in our country. Women, Black women, Black Americans, South Asian Americans, immigrants, the left-out and left-behind.But she's overcome every obstacle she's ever faced. No one's been tougher on the big banks or the gun lobby. No one's been tougher in calling out this current administration for its extremism, its failure to follow the law, and its failure to simply tell the truth.Kamala and I both draw strength from our families. For Kamala, it's Doug and their families.For me, it's Jill and ours.No man deserves one great love in his life. But I've known two. After losing my first wife in a car accident, Jill came into my life and put our family back together.She's an educator. A mom. A military Mom. And an unstoppable force. If she puts her mind to it, just get out of the way. Because she's going to get it done. She was a great Second Lady and she will make a great First Lady for this nation, she loves this country so much.And I will have the strength that can only come from family. Hunter, Ashley and all our grandchildren, my brothers, my sister. They give me courage and lift me up.And while he is no longer with us, Beau inspires me every day.Beau served our nation in uniform. A decorated Iraq war veteran.So I take very personally the profound responsibility of serving as Commander in Chief.I will be a president who will stand with our allies and friends. I will make it clear to our adversaries the days of cozying up to dictators are over.Under President Biden, America will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers. Nor will I put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise , voting.I will stand always for our values of human rights and dignity. And I will work in common purpose for a more secure, peaceful, and prosperous world.History has thrust one more urgent task on us. Will we be the generation that finally wipes the stain of racism from our national character?I believe we're up to it.I believe we're ready.Just a week ago yesterday was the third anniversary of the events in Charlottesville.Remember seeing those neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists coming out of the fields with lighted torches? Veins bulging? Spewing the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the '30s?Remember the violent clash that ensued between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it?Remember what the president said?There were quote, \"very fine people on both sides.\"It was a wake-up call for us as a country.And for me, a call to action. At that moment, I knew I'd have to run. My father taught us that silence was complicity. And I could not remain silent or complicit.At the time, I said we were in a battle for the soul of this nation.And we are.One of the most important conversations I've had this entire campaign is with someone who is too young to vote.I met with six-year old Gianna Floyd, a day before her Daddy George Floyd was laid to rest.She is incredibly brave.I'll never forget.When I leaned down to speak with her, she looked into my eyes and said \"Daddy, changed the world.\"Her words burrowed deep into my heart.Maybe George Floyd's murder was the breaking point.Maybe John Lewis' passing the inspiration.However it has come to be, America is ready to in John's words, to lay down \"the heavy burdens of hate at last\" and to do the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism.America's history tells us that it has been in our darkest moments that we've made our greatest progress. That we've found the light. And in this dark moment, I believe we are poised to make great progress again. That we can find the light once more.I have always believed you can define America in one word: Possibilities.That in America, everyone, and I mean everyone, should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them.We can never lose that. In times as challenging as these, I believe there is only one way forward. As a united America. United in our pursuit of a more perfect Union. United in our dreams of a better future for us and for our children. United in our determination to make the coming years bright.Are we ready?I believe we are.This is a great nation.And we are a good and decent people.This is the United States of America.And there has never been anything we've been unable to accomplish when we've done it together.The Irish poet Seamus Heaney once wrote:\"History says,Don't hope on this side of the grave,But then, once in a lifetimeThe longed-for tidal waveOf justice can rise up,And hope and history rhyme\"This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme.With passion and purpose, let us begin , you and I together, one nation, under God , united in our love for America and united in our love for each other.For love is more powerful than hate.Hope is more powerful than fear.Light is more powerful than dark.This is our moment.This is our mission.May history be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight as love and hope and light joined in the battle for the soul of the nation.And this is a battle that we, together, will win.I promise you.Thank you.And may God bless you.And may God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1462243\/transcript-joe-bidens-dnc-speech&speechType=1","Summary":"Business and Consumers Civil Liberties and Civil Rights Infrastructure Health and Health Care Economy and Fiscal Arts, Entertainment, and History Elections","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/08\/20\/politics\/biden-dnc-speech-transcript\/index.html","CleanText":"Good evening.Ella Baker, a giant of the civil rights movement, left us with this wisdom: Give people light and they will find a way.Give people light.Those are words for our time.The current president has cloaked America in darkness for much too long.

All we can ever know is whether we'll be ready when that moment arrives.And now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments America has ever faced.Four historic crises. All at the same time. A perfect storm.The worst pandemic in over 100 years. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.The most compelling call for racial justice since the 60's. And the undeniable realities and accelerating threats of climate change.So, the question for us is simple: Are we ready?I believe we are.We must be.All elections are important. But we know in our bones this one is more consequential.America is at an inflection point. A time of real peril, but of extraordinary possibilities.We can choose the path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, and more divided.A path of shadow and suspicion.Or we can choose a different path, and together, take this chance to heal, to be reborn, to unite. A path of hope and light.This is a life-changing election that will determine America's future for a very long time.Character is on the ballot. Compassion is on the ballot. Decency, science, democracy.They are all on the ballot.Who we are as a nation. What we stand for. And, most importantly, who we want to be.That's all on the ballot.And the choice could not be clearer.No rhetoric is needed.Just judge this president on the facts.5 million Americans infected with COVID-19.More than 170,000 Americans have died.By far the worst performance of any nation on Earth.More than 50 million people have filed for unemployment this year.More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year.Nearly one in 6 small businesses have closed this year.If this president is re-elected we know what will happen.Cases and deaths will remain far too high.More mom and pop businesses will close their doors for good.Working families will struggle to get by, and yet, the wealthiest one percent will get tens of billions of dollars in new tax breaks.And the assault on the Affordable Care Act will continue until its destroyed, taking insurance away from more than 20 million people , including more than 15 million people on Medicaid , and getting rid of the protections that President Obama and I passed for people who suffer from a pre-existing condition.And speaking of President Obama, a man I was honored to serve alongside for 8 years as Vice President. Let me take this moment to say something we don't say nearly enough.Thank you, Mr. President. You were a great president. A president our children could , and did , look up to.No one will say that about the current occupant of the office.What we know about this president is if he's given four more years he will be what he's been the last four years.A president who takes no responsibility, refuses to lead, blames others, cozies up to dictators, and fans the flames of hate and division.He will wake up every day believing the job is all about him. Never about you.Is that the America you want for you, your family, your children?I see a different America.One that is generous and strong.Selfless and humble.It's an America we can rebuild together.As president, the first step I will take will be to get control of the virus that's ruined so many lives.Because I understand something this president doesn't.We will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back to school, we will never have our lives back, until we deal with this virus.The tragedy of where we are today is it didn't have to be this bad.Just look around.It's not this bad in Canada. Or Europe. Or Japan. Or almost anywhere else in the world.The President keeps telling us the virus is going to disappear. He keeps waiting for a miracle. Well, I have news for him, no miracle is coming.We lead the world in confirmed cases. We lead the world in deaths.Our economy is in tatters, with Black, Latino, Asian American, and Native American communities bearing the brunt of it.And after all this time, the president still does not have a plan.Well, I do.If I'm president on day one we'll implement the national strategy I've been laying out since March.We'll develop and deploy rapid tests with results available immediately.We'll make the medical supplies and protective equipment our country needs. And we'll make them here in America. So we will never again be at the mercy of China and other foreign countries in order to protect our own people.We'll make sure our schools have the resources they need to be open, safe, and effective.We'll put the politics aside and take the muzzle off our experts so the public gets the information they need and deserve. The honest, unvarnished truth. They can deal with that.We'll have a national mandate to wear a mask-not as a burden, but to protect each other.It's a patriotic duty.In short, I will do what we should have done from the very beginning.Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to this nation.He failed to protect us.He failed to protect America.And, my fellow Americans, that is unforgivable.As president, I will make you this promise: I will protect America. I will defend us from every attack. Seen. And unseen. Always. Without exception. Every time.Look, I understand it's hard to have hope right now.On this summer night, let me take a moment to speak to those of you who have lost the most.I know how it feels to lose someone you love. I know that deep black hole that opens up in your chest. That you feel your whole being is sucked into it. I know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes.But I've learned two things.First, your loved ones may have left this Earth but they never leave your heart. They will always be with you.And second, I found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose.As God's children each of us have a purpose in our lives.And we have a great purpose as a nation: To open the doors of opportunity to all Americans. To save our democracy. To be a light to the world once again.To finally live up to and make real the words written in the sacred documents that founded this nation that all men and women are created equal. Endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. Among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.You know, my Dad was an honorable, decent man.He got knocked down a few times pretty hard, but always got up.He worked hard and built a great middle-class life for our family.He used to say, 'Joey, I don't expect the government to solve my problems, but I expect it to understand them.'And then he would say: 'Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in your community. It's about looking your kids in the eye and say, honey, it's going to be okay.'I've never forgotten those lessons.That's why my economic plan is all about jobs, dignity, respect, and community. Together, we can, and we will, rebuild our economy. And when we do, we'll not only build it back, we'll build it back better.With modern roads, bridges, highways, broadband, ports and airports as a new foundation for economic growth. With pipes that transport clean water to every community. With 5 million new manufacturing and technology jobs so the future is made in America.With a health care system that lowers premiums, deductibles, and drug prices by building on the Affordable Care Act he's trying to rip away.With an education system that trains our people for the best jobs of the 21st century, where cost doesn't prevent young people from going to college, and student debt doesn't crush them when they get out.With child care and elder care that make it possible for parents to go to work and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity. With an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values. With newly empowered labor unions. With equal pay for women. With rising wages you can raise a family on. Yes, we're going to do more than praise our essential workers. We're finally going to pay them.We can, and we will, deal with climate change. It's not only a crisis, it's an enormous opportunity. An opportunity for America to lead the world in clean energy and create millions of new good-paying jobs in the process.And we can pay for these investments by ending loopholes and the president's $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1 percent and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of which pay no tax at all.Because we don't need a tax code that rewards wealth more than it rewards work. I'm not looking to punish anyone. Far from it. But it's long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share.For our seniors, Social Security is a sacred obligation, a sacred promise made. The current president is threatening to break that promise. He's proposing to eliminate the tax that pays for almost half of Social Security without any way of making up for that lost revenue.I will not let it happen. If I'm your president, we're going to protect Social Security and Medicare. You have my word.One of the most powerful voices we hear in the country today is from our young people. They're speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in America. Economic injustice. Racial injustice. Environmental injustice.I hear their voices and if you listen, you can hear them too. And whether it's the existential threat posed by climate change, the daily fear of being gunned down in school, or the inability to get started in their first job , it will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America to everyone.I won't have to do it alone. Because I will have a great Vice President at my side. Senator Kamala Harris. She is a powerful voice for this nation. Her story is the American story. She knows about all the obstacles thrown in the way of so many in our country. Women, Black women, Black Americans, South Asian Americans, immigrants, the left-out and left-behind.But she's overcome every obstacle she's ever faced. No one's been tougher on the big banks or the gun lobby. No one's been tougher in calling out this current administration for its extremism, its failure to follow the law, and its failure to simply tell the truth.Kamala and I both draw strength from our families. For Kamala, it's Doug and their families.For me, it's Jill and ours.No man deserves one great love in his life. But I've known two. After losing my first wife in a car accident, Jill came into my life and put our family back together.She's an educator. A mom. A military Mom. And an unstoppable force. If she puts her mind to it, just get out of the way. Because she's going to get it done. She was a great Second Lady and she will make a great First Lady for this nation, she loves this country so much.And I will have the strength that can only come from family. Hunter, Ashley and all our grandchildren, my brothers, my sister. They give me courage and lift me up.And while he is no longer with us, Beau inspires me every day.Beau served our nation in uniform. A decorated Iraq war veteran.So I take very personally the profound responsibility of serving as Commander in Chief.I will be a president who will stand with our allies and friends. I will make it clear to our adversaries the days of cozying up to dictators are over.Under President Biden, America will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers. Nor will I put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise , voting.I will stand always for our values of human rights and dignity. And I will work in common purpose for a more secure, peaceful, and prosperous world.History has thrust one more urgent task on us. Will we be the generation that finally wipes the stain of racism from our national character?I believe we're up to it.I believe we're ready.Just a week ago yesterday was the third anniversary of the events in Charlottesville.Remember seeing those neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists coming out of the fields with lighted torches? Veins bulging? Spewing the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the '30s?Remember the violent clash that ensued between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it?Remember what the president said?There were quote, 'very fine people on both sides.'It was a wake-up call for us as a country.And for me, a call to action. At that moment, I knew I'd have to run. My father taught us that silence was complicity. And I could not remain silent or complicit.At the time, I said we were in a battle for the soul of this nation.And we are.One of the most important conversations I've had this entire campaign is with someone who is too young to vote.I met with six-year old Gianna Floyd, a day before her Daddy George Floyd was laid to rest.She is incredibly brave.I'll never forget.When I leaned down to speak with her, she looked into my eyes and said 'Daddy, changed the world.'Her words burrowed deep into my heart.Maybe George Floyd's murder was the breaking point.Maybe John Lewis' passing the inspiration.However it has come to be, America is ready to in John's words, to lay down 'the heavy burdens of hate at last' and to do the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism.America's history tells us that it has been in our darkest moments that we've made our greatest progress. That we've found the light. And in this dark moment, I believe we are poised to make great progress again. That we can find the light once more.I have always believed you can define America in one word: Possibilities.That in America, everyone, and I mean everyone, should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them.We can never lose that. In times as challenging as these, I believe there is only one way forward. As a united America. United in our pursuit of a more perfect Union. United in our dreams of a better future for us and for our children. United in our determination to make the coming years bright.Are we ready?I believe we are.This is a great nation.And we are a good and decent people.This is the United States of America.And there has never been anything we've been unable to accomplish when we've done it together.The Irish poet Seamus Heaney once wrote:'History says,Don't hope on this side of the grave,But then, once in a lifetimeThe longed-for tidal waveOf justice can rise up,And hope and history rhyme'This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme.With passion and purpose, let us begin , you and I together, one nation, under God , united in our love for America and united in our love for each other.For love is more powerful than hate.Hope is more powerful than fear.Light is more powerful than dark.This is our moment.This is our mission.May history be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight as love and hope and light joined in the battle for the soul of the nation.And this is a battle that we, together, will win.I promise you.Thank you.And may God bless you.And may God protect our troops."}

From the suffragists, to the labor organizers, to the women who continue to lead the fight for the Equal Rights Amendment, and from the glass-ceiling breakers to the women in every workplace who have to fight twice as hard just to prove their basic dignity every single day, American women have pushed this country forward, one step at a time. There can be no half measures when it comes to equality. That's why we must keep working. 100 years ago today, the final paperwork was signed, officially proclaiming the ratification of the 19th Amendment to our Constitution, and of the right of women to vote in the United States of America. It was a culmination of decades of struggle to achieve a Constitutional amendment on women's suffrage, and a true milestone for our nation. But it was also only the beginning of a long, still unfinished march toward full equality for all women, especially for women of color who were still not guaranteed their right to vote until the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and even longer for Latinas and Native American women. Now, it is up to us to carry forward the banner of equality for the next generation, to build on the legacy of Shirley Chisholm and Geraldine Ferraro and Hillary Clinton to elect Kamala Harris as our next Vice President; to fully deliver on the promise of equal pay for equal work; to ensure women's access to health care, eliminate health disparities, and protect women's ability to make their own health care choices; and to end the scourge of violence against women. It starts by voting this November. It starts by exercising that sacred American right, which so many have marched and suffered to secure. We can do this.

These are not images from some imagined \"Joe Biden's America\" in the future. These are images from Donald Trump's America today. The violence we're witnessing is happening under Donald Trump. Not me. It's getting worse, and we know why. Donald Trump refuses to even acknowledge there is a racial justice problem in America. To solve this problem, first we have to honestly admit the problem. But he won't do it. Instead of looking to calm the waters, he adds fuel to every fire. Violence isn't a problem in his eyes , it's a political strategy. And the more of it, the better for him. One of his top White House advisors said it flat out earlier today. \"The more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who's best on public safety and law and order.\" The better it is. I have made it clear. There is no place for violence, looting, or burning. None. Zero. All it does it hurt the communities reeling from injustice , and it destroys the businesses that serve them , many of them run by people of color who for the first time in their lives have begun to build wealth for their family. But while I have condemned all forms of violence , police violence, lawless violence and violence perpetrated by extreme, right-wing militia groups , like the groups the 17-year-old just arrested in Illinois for murdering two people in Wisconsin is reputed to have been aligned with. Trump doesn't speak out against these extreme right-wing groups. Instead , as he did about Charlottesville , he embraces them. If you're worried about the violence you're witnessing, you better be worried about the armed militias , often aligned with white supremacists and white nationalists and Neo-Nazis and the KKK , who are often the source of the biggest trouble. I am sure Donald Trump will stand before America and say the same things his vice president said last night. And when he does, remember: every example of violence he decries has happened on his watch. Under his leadership. During his presidency.

Today, I am calling on President Trump to commit to the three principles of integrity in the development of a vaccine. These are the same principles I will follow as President:First, scientists and public health experts decide on safety and efficacy. The White House should not weigh in on these matters or push the FDA to provide emergency authorizations prematurely, as they did for hydroxychloroquine. The President should not \"hype\" treatments or vaccines, overstate their results, or undermine confidence in scientific findings. Second, clinical data for any vaccine the FDA approves should be made available to the public for independent expert review. The FDA should convene the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee for public session prior to any final FDA decision. Third, there must be full transparency on recommendations by career staff. The career staff in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research should be authorized to write a written report for public review. If the FDA Commissioner decides to reverse the career staff's findings, he must explain the basis of the decision in a public report. Before a license is final, senior career scientists and public health experts should be allowed to make public, uncensored statements and appear before Congress unconstrained to speak the truth.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1461560\/statement-from-joe-biden-on-covid-19-vaccines&speechType=6","Summary":"Executive Branch Health and Health Care","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/joebiden.com\/2020\/07\/27\/statement-from-vp-joe-biden-on-covid-19-vaccines\/","CleanText":"It's great news that scientists are making progress in the search for a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.

I'm here today to talk about a crisis that's being felt in households all across America. Jill and I have just been briefed by our public health and education experts about what it will take to re-open our schools safely and effectively. Back to school is always a special time for the Biden family. Jill's an educator and she'll be the first one to tell you that this should be a season of promise for our country. A time when classrooms are crackling with the possibilities of a new year and students' hopes for their futures. And this year facing the most difficult circumstances we're seeing the grit and heart of our educators and students as they rise to the occasion. But our government hasn't come up to that bar. Let me be clear if President Trump and his Administration had done their jobs America's schools would be open. Instead, America's families are paying the price for his failures. I've heard from parents all throughout this pandemic. They're struggling to do the right thing , but they're worried. What does this mean for my kids? Is this setting back their education? How will they catch up? What if I'm not doing enough to help them succeed? President Trump may not think this is a national emergency but I do. Protecting our students, our educators, and our communities. Getting our schools open safely and effectively , this is a national emergency. But President Trump still does not have a real plan for how to open our schools safely. No real plan for how to help parents feel secure for their children. He's offered us nothing but failure and delusions from start to finish and American families and our children are paying the price. Failure to take this virus seriously early on in January and February as it spread around the globe. Failure to take the steps we needed back in March and April to get this pandemic under control, to institute widespread testing and tracing to control the spread. Failure to provide clear national, science-based guidance to state and local authorities. Failure to model even basic responsibilities like social distancing and mask wearing. And failure to make sure educators and administrators have the equipment, resources, and training they need to reopen safely. Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos haven't stepped up. And we're all seeing the result: Millions of students are now starting a new school year the same way they finished the last one , at home. Parents are doing their best but more and more are finding themselves at their wit's end, struggling to balance work and child care and educational duties. Or worrying about their lost paycheck and how they'll make ends meet while trying to keep their kid on track with remote learning. Educators are taking on countless hours of additional training to learn how to use remote learning tools so they can still be there for their students. But they're worried about the kids who used to count on schools to provide two filling meals and a safe place to spend the day. And we're all concerned about making sure COVID-19 doesn't further exacerbate the disparities that already exist in our educational system for so many poor children and so many communities of color. It's unacceptable. We can't go on like this. We all want our schools to reopen , safely. With a plan that prioritizes the health of students and educators alike. I laid out my plans for this back in June and July , a roadmap for how to open safely and effectively. You can read them at JoeBiden.com. We need straight-forward, common-sense solutions. But Trump refuses to act , starving schools of the funding they need. Now, Trump's FEMA director is cutting schools loose. Just yesterday, FEMA announced that they will not help pay for cloth masks and other PPE for school settings claiming these basic health and safety costs for schools do not qualify for emergency assistance. As I said, this is a national emergency and Donald Trump and his FEMA should treat it as one. If I were president today, I would direct FEMA to make sure that our K-12 schools get full access to disaster relief and emergency assistance funds under the Stafford Act. I would make sure that PPE and sanitation supplies for schools qualify as \"emergency protective measures\" with full eligibility for federal assistance. On top of that, I would be working with leaders in Congress , now, today , to pass an emergency package for schools so they have all the resources they need. Money for ventilation and other health measures , but also more money to hire more teachers to keep classes small and socially distanced money for more psychologists and counselors to support our kids' mental health. The nation's school superintendents have estimated that we will need at least $200 billion to support K-12 schools through a safe reopening. And we'll need money for higher education as well for our four-year colleges and universities, for our community colleges, and for our HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions. The Democratic leaders are ready to get this done. Where is the president? Why isn't he working on this? We need emergency support funding for our schools , and we need it now. Mr. President, that is your job. That's what you should be focused on, getting our kids back to school. Not whipping up fear and division , not inciting violence in our streets. Get off Twitter. Invite the leaders of Congress to the Oval Office and do what you boast about , but never seem to actually do , negotiate a deal to help someone other than yourself.

Nearly 3,000 lives were cut short on that God-awful September day: a once-unthinkable toll which tore open the hearts of sons and daughters, parents, siblings, grandchildren and grandparents, neighbors and friends , loved ones faced with the harrowing, hollowing news that the dearest thing in their life had been suddenly taken away. In the days that followed September 11th, we wondered together whether life in America had been permanently thrown off of its axis. But as so often happens in moments of crisis, the tragedy of 9\/11 revealed the character of Americans. First responders and ordinary citizens who ran courageously into the cloak of ash and fire to save the lives of those they'd never met. A new generation who answered the call to serve their country in uniform. Our leaders, who put differences aside for a time to form a united front of empathy, comfort, and resolve for a nation in mourning. And our people, who came together to summon from our shared grief the hope and common purpose we needed to get up and go on. Though the wounds of that day will never fully heal, the spirit of Americans recovered as it always does , unbowed by the efforts of those who strike against it. In the years since, American heroes have sacrificed bravely in service to our nation; thousands gave what Lincoln called \"the last full measure of devotion,\" laying down their lives in defense of the American idea. Countless families, including my own, waited breathlessly for children to return home from theaters of war. We sought to heal and grow from the misplaced hatred directed toward Muslim Americans. Firefighters, police officers, and first responders battled long-term health consequences for their bravery , and our nation incurred a moral obligation to help those heroes, and deliver justice and accountability for all 9\/11 families, that continues to this day. And the American people rose to every challenge with characteristic strength and resilience. Like a generation once did in the wake of Pearl Harbor, this generation of Americans bore the burden that history placed on our shoulders that day. And this year, we mark the anniversary of 9\/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss , a crisis that has already taken nearly 200,000 Americans, testing our resolve and character with each passing day. Now, as then, our heroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things: nurses and doctors; delivery drivers and grocery clerks; public transit workers and educators; regular Americans thrust into courageous acts of sacrifice and service. Now, as then, we owe it to them to come together as a nation , so that Americans can once again do what we did so bravely nineteen years ago: turn from tragedy to purpose, rebuild our lives, and begin, in time, to heal.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1465143\/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-19-th-anniversary-of-the-september-11-th-attacks&speechType=6","Summary":"Arts, Entertainment, and History","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/joebiden.com\/2020\/09\/11\/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-19th-anniversary-of-the-september-11th-attacks\/","CleanText":"Nineteen years ago, our nation was tested by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hate.

Like a generation once did in the wake of Pearl Harbor, this generation of Americans bore the burden that history placed on our shoulders that day. And this year, we mark the anniversary of 9\/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss , a crisis that has already taken nearly 200,000 Americans, testing our resolve and character with each passing day. Now, as then, our heroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things: nurses and doctors; delivery drivers and grocery clerks; public transit workers and educators; regular Americans thrust into courageous acts of sacrifice and service. Now, as then, we owe it to them to come together as a nation , so that Americans can once again do what we did so bravely nineteen years ago: turn from tragedy to purpose, rebuild our lives, and begin, in time, to heal."}

Each of them helped make our communities and our families safer, and delivered real results for vulnerable communities. And we must fight for each of them again today. Writing and passing VAWA remains to this day the legislative accomplishment of which I am most proud. With VAWA, we took an enormous step in the long, hard work of changing the culture in our country of silence and acceptance around the issues of sexual assault and domestic violence by making it clear these were not private, family matters , they were crimes. We invested in the structures and systems so that women who were not safe in their homes could get support and security for themselves and their children. We created a national hotline so that women could reach out for help. We gave prosecutors the tools they needed to hold abusers accountable, and we created new protections for vulnerable populations of women, including Native women and immigrants. In the decades since we passed VAWA the first time, incidents of intimate partner violence have decreased drastically. Each time VAWA has been reauthorized, with the support of strong leadership and the tireless work of advocates, Congress came together with bipartisan majorities to strengthen and expand protections. But President Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have decided to block the most recent VAWA reauthorization, because it would close the so-called \"boyfriend loophole\" and prevent abusive dating partners from buying a gun. Similarly, Republicans allowed the bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines to expire after just ten years. We know these bans worked. Multiple analyses of the data around mass shootings provide evidence that, from 1994 to 2004, the years when assault weapons and high-capacity magazines were banned, there were fewer mass shootings , fewer deaths, fewer families needlessly destroyed. There's overwhelming data that shootings committed with assault weapons kill more people than shootings with other types of guns. Yet, despite this knowledge, President Trump and Republican leadership in Congress refuse to pass even the most basic common sense gun safety measures , including reinstating the assault weapons and high-capacity magazine bans, which has the support of nearly 70 percent of the American public. Today, the victories we won 26 years ago remain unfinished. Congress must once more demonstrate the courage and leadership necessary to again stand against violence, intimidation, and the abuse of power in all its forms.

It is not the gift or the birthright of any nation, but a responsibility that demands constant engagement and vigilance by all our citizens. On International Day of Democracy, we must acknowledge the dangers posed to democracy, both at home and abroad, and recommit ourselves to the task of defending our most sacred values. When the United States falls short in our democracy at home, it robs our fellow Americans of the equality and freedom we all deserve, it undermines faith in our system and it damages our ability to lead the world in confronting the wide range of threats and challenges we face. Over the past three and a half years, Donald Trump has recklessly and routinely taken a battering ram to the pillars of America's democracy , repeatedly attacking our institutions and values , amplified racist hatred for his own political ends, and traded the friendship of our democratic allies for photo ops with authoritarians and dictators. Trump's assault on democracy has made our nation, and indeed the world, less secure. Under a Biden-Harris administration, the United States will put democracy and human rights at the center of America's foreign policy.

It is not the gift or the birthright of any nation, but a responsibility that demands constant engagement and vigilance by all our citizens. On International Day of Democracy, we must acknowledge the dangers posed to democracy, both at home and abroad, and recommit ourselves to the task of defending our most sacred values. When the United States falls short in our democracy at home, it robs our fellow Americans of the equality and freedom we all deserve, it undermines faith in our system and it damages our ability to lead the world in confronting the wide range of threats and challenges we face. Over the past three and a half years, Donald Trump has recklessly and routinely taken a battering ram to the pillars of America's democracy , repeatedly attacking our institutions and values , amplified racist hatred for his own political ends, and traded the friendship of our democratic allies for photo ops with authoritarians and dictators. Trump's assault on democracy has made our nation, and indeed the world, less secure. Under a Biden-Harris administration, the United States will put democracy and human rights at the center of America's foreign policy. We cannot stand up for these principles around the world if we do not first do the same for all Americans at home.

It is the same question that all of us , Jewish or not , should ask ourselves in this moment of widespread struggle and pain. What kind of people do we wish to be?

It calls us to fulfill our responsibilities to treat our fellow human beings with dignity, decency, and respect. It inspires us to make real the promise of our values by protecting public health; preserving our planet; working toward racial equity; stamping out anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry; reaffirming our identity as a nation of immigrants; and pursuing peace and security at home, in Israel, and throughout the world.

With many women serving as sole or primary breadwinners, this cannot go on for working families. We must do something to improve women's economic security in America, and this November, we can. As President, I will work to contain this virus, get folks safely back to work and school, and build America back better for women so it is more inclusive and equal. That means tackling the gender wage gap and wage discrimination, building on the progress we made during the Obama-Biden Administration. In addition, a Biden-Harris Administration will address challenges facing Native women, such as access to comprehensive health care and affordable child care that are critical to ensuring a better quality of life. We will also tackle the crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women. Native women should not have to work nine extra months into the year to earn what the average white man earned last year. They deserve better. A Biden-Harris Administration will stand with women in Indian Country."}

{"SpeechID":"VSJB6102020193","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-10-06","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by Vice President Joe Biden in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania","Type":"speech","RawText":"On July 4, 1863, America woke to the remains of perhaps the most consequential battle ever fought on American soil. It took place here on this ground in Gettysburg. Three days of violence, three days of carnage. 50,000 casualties wounded, captured, missing or dead. Over three days of fighting. When the sun rose on that Independence Day, Lee would retreat. The war would go on for nearly two more years, but the back of the Confederacy had been broken. The Union would be saved, slavery would be abolished. Government of, by, and for the people would not perish from the earth, and freedom would be born anew in our land. There is no more fitting place than here today in Gettysburg to talk about the cost of division , about how much it has cost America in the past, about how much it is costing us now, and about why I believe in this moment we must come together as a nation. For President Lincoln, the Civil War was about the greatest of causes: the end of slavery, the widening of equality, the pursuit of justice, the creation of opportunity, and the sanctity of freedom. His words here would live ever after. We hear them in our heads, we know them in our hearts, we draw on them when we seek hope in the hours of darkness. \"Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" Here, on this sacred ground, Abraham Lincoln reimagined America itself. Here, a president of the United States spoke of the price of division and the meaning of sacrifice. He believed in the rescue, the redemption, and the rededication of the Union, all this in a time not just of ferocious division, but also widespread death, structural inequality, and fear of the future. And he taught us this: A house divided could not stand. That is a great and timeless truth. Today, once again, we are a house divided. But that, my friends, can no longer be. We are facing too many crises. We have too much work to do. We have too bright a future to leave it shipwrecked on the shoals of anger and hate and division. As we stand here today, a century and a half after Gettysburg, we should consider again what can happen when equal justice is denied, and when anger and violence and division are left unchecked. As I look across America today, I'm concerned. The country is in a dangerous place. Our trust in each other is ebbing. Hope is elusive. Too many Americans see our public life not as an arena for the mediation of our differences. Rather, they see it as an occasion for total, unrelenting partisan warfare. Instead of treating the other party as the opposition, we treat them as the enemy. This must end. We need to revive a spirit of bipartisanship in this country, a spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, I'm accused of being na\u00efve. I'm told maybe that's the way things used to work, but they can't anymore. Well, I'm here to say they can. And they must if we're going to get anything done. I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I will work with Democrats and Republicans and I will work as hard for those who don't support me as for those who do. That's the job of a president. It's a duty of care for everyone. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision. A choice we make. And if we can decide not to cooperate, we can decide to cooperate as well. That's the choice I'll make as president. But there is something bigger going on in the nation than just our broken politics, something darker, something more dangerous. I'm not talking about ordinary differences of opinion. Competing viewpoints give life and vibrancy to our democracy. No, I'm talking about something different, something deeper. Too many Americans seek not to overcome our divisions, but to deepen them. We must seek not to build walls, but bridges. We must seek not to clench our fists, but to open our arms. We must seek not to tear each other apart, but to come together. You don't have to agree with me on everything , or even on most things , to see that what we're experiencing today is neither good nor normal. I made the decision to run for president after Charlottesville. Close your eyes. Remember what you saw. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists and the KKK coming out of the fields with torches lit. Veins bulging. Chanting the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the 1930s. It was hate on the march, in the open. In America. Hate never goes away. It only hides. And when it is given oxygen, when it is given the opportunity to spread, when it is treated as normal and acceptable behavior we have opened a door in this country we must move quickly to close. As President, I will do that. I will send a clear, unequivocal message to the nation. There is no place for hate in America. It will be given no license. It will be given no oxygen. It will be given no safe harbor. In recent weeks and months, the country has been roiled by instances of excessive police force, by heart wrenching cases of racial injustice and lives needlessly and senselessly lost, by peaceful protests giving voice to the calls for justice, and by examples of violence and looting and burning that cannot be tolerated. I believe in law and order. I have never supported defunding the police. But I also believe injustice is real. It's the product of a history that goes back 400 years, to the moment when black men, women, and children were first brought here in chains. I do not believe we have to choose between law and order and racial justice in America. We can have both. This nation is strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism, and strong enough to provide safe streets for our families and small businesses that too often bear the brunt of this looting and burning. We have no need for armed militias roaming America's streets, and we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacist groups menacing our communities. If you say we should trust America's law enforcement authorities to do their jobs as I do, then let them do their job without extremist groups acting as vigilantes. And if you say we have no need to face racial injustice in this country, you haven't opened your eyes to the truth in America. There have been powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months. George Floyd's 6-year old daughter Gianna, who I met with, was one such voice when she said, \"Daddy changed the world.\" Also, Jacob Blake's mother was another when she said violence didn't reflect her son and that this nation needed healing. And Doc Rivers, the basketball coach choking back tears when he said, \"We're the ones getting killed. We're the ones getting shot We've been hung. It's amazing why we keep loving this country, and this country does not love us back.\" Think about that. Think about what it takes for a Black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country that for far too long we have never fully recognized. What we need in America is leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, to open lines of communication, and to bring us together. To heal. And to hope. As President, that is precisely what I will do. We have paid a high price for allowing the deep divisions in this country to impact how we have dealt with the coronavirus. 210,000 Americans dead and the numbers climbing. It's estimated that nearly another 210,000 Americans could lose their lives by the end of the year. Enough. No more. Let's set the partisanship aside. Let's end the politics. Let's follow the science. Wearing a mask isn't a political statement. It's a scientific recommendation. Social distancing isn't a political statement. It's a scientific recommendation. Testing. Tracing. The development, ultimately approval and distribution of a vaccine isn't a political statement. These are scientific-based decisions. We can't undo what has been done. We can't go back. But we can do better. We can do better starting today. We can have a national strategy that puts the politics aside and saves lives. We can have a national strategy that will make it possible for our schools and businesses to open safely. We can have a national strategy that reflects the true values of this nation. The pandemic is not a red state versus blue state issue. The virus doesn't care where you live or what political party you belong to. It infects us all. It will take anyone's life. It is a virus , not a political weapon. There's another enduring division in America that we must end: The divisions in our economic life that give opportunity only to the privileged few. America has to be about mobility. It has to be the kind of country where an Abraham Lincoln , a child of the distant frontier, can rise to our highest office. America has to be about the possibilities. The possibilities of prosperity. Not just for the privileged few. But for the many , for all of us. Working people and their kids deserve an opportunity. Lincoln knew this. He said that the country had to give people \"an open field and a fair chance.\" And that's what we're going to do in the America we're going to build , together. We fought a Civil War that would secure a Union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all. And by fits and starts , our better angels have prevailed just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation. And those better angels can prevail again , now. They must prevail again , now. A hundred years after Lincoln spoke here at Gettysburg then Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson also came here and said: \"Our nation found its soul in honor on these fields of Gettysburg We must not lose that soul in dishonor now on the fields of hate.\" Today we are engaged once again in a battle for the soul of the nation. The forces of darkness, the forces of division, the forces of yesterday are pulling us apart, holding us down, and holding us back. We must free ourselves of all of them. As president, I will embrace hope, not fear. Peace, not violence. Generosity, not greed. Light, not darkness. I will be a president who appeals to the best in us. Not the worst. I will be a president who pushes towards the future. Not one who clings to the past. I am ready to fight for you and for our nation. Every day. Without exception, without reservation. And with a full and devoted heart. We cannot , and will not , allow extremists and white supremacists to overturn the America of Lincoln and Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. To overturn the America that has welcomed immigrants from distant shores. To overturn the America that's been a haven and a home for everyone no matter their background. From Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, we're at our best when the promise of America is available to all. We cannot and will not allow violence in the streets to threaten the people of this nation. We cannot and will not walk away from our obligation to, at long last, face the reckoning on race and racial justice in the country. We cannot and will not continue to be stuck in a partisan politics that lets this virus thrive while the public health of this nation suffers. We cannot and will not accept an economic equation that only favors those who've already got it made. Everybody deserves a shot at prosperity. Duty and history call presidents to provide for the common good. And I will. It won't be easy. Our divisions today are of long standing. Economic and racial inequities have shaped us for generations. But I give you my word: If I am elected President, I will marshal the ingenuity and good will of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together. We can disagree about how to move forward, but we must take the first step. And it starts with how we treat one another, how we talk to one another, how we respect one another. In his Second Inaugural, Lincoln said, \"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds.\" Now we have our work to reunite America, to bind up the nation's wounds, to move past shadow and suspicion. And so we , you and I, together , press on, even now. After hearing the Second Inaugural Address, Frederick Douglass told the president: \"Mr. Lincoln, that was a sacred effort.\" We must be dedicated now to our own sacred effort. The promise of Gettysburg, that a new birth of freedom was at hand, is at risk. Every generation that has followed Gettysburg has been faced with a moment , when it must answer this question , whether it will allow the sacrifices made here to be in vain. This is our moment to answer this essential American question for ourselves and for our time. And my answer is this: It cannot be that after all this country has been through. After all that America has accomplished, after all the years we have stood as a beacon of light to the world, it cannot be that here and now, in 2020, we will allow government of the people, by the people, and for the people to perish from this earth. No. It cannot. It must not. We have in our hands the ultimate power: the power of the vote. It is the noblest instrument ever devised to register our will in a peaceable and productive fashion. And so we must. We must vote. And we will vote no matter how many obstacles are thrown in our way. Because once America votes, America will be heard. Lincoln said: \"The nation is worth fighting for.\" So it was. So it is. Together, as one nation, under God, indivisible, let us join forces to fight the common foes of injustice and inequality, of hate and fear. Let us conduct ourselves as Americans who love each other , who love our country and who will not destroy, but will build. We owe that to the dead who are buried here at Gettysburg. And we owe that to the living and to future generations yet to be born. You and I are part of a great covenant, a common story of divisions overcome and of hope renewed. If we do our part. If we stand together. If we keep faith with the past and with each other, then the divisions of our time can give way to the dreams of a brighter, better, future. This is our work. This is our pledge. This is our mission. We can end this era of division. We can end the hate and the fear. We can be what we are at our best: The United States of America. God bless you. And may God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1472316\/remarks-by-vice-president-joe-biden-in-gettysburg-pennsylvania&speechType=1","Summary":"Civil Liberties and Civil Rights Health and Health Care Arts, Entertainment, and History Criminal Justice","Source":null,"Location":"Gettysburg, PA","Original source":"https:\/\/joebiden.com\/2020\/10\/06\/remarks-by-vice-president-joe-biden-in-gettysburg-pennsylvania\/","CleanText":"On July 4, 1863, America woke to the remains of perhaps the most consequential battle ever fought on American soil.

And by fits and starts , our better angels have prevailed just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation. And those better angels can prevail again , now. They must prevail again , now. A hundred years after Lincoln spoke here at Gettysburg then Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson also came here and said: 'Our nation found its soul in honor on these fields of Gettysburg We must not lose that soul in dishonor now on the fields of hate.' Today we are engaged once again in a battle for the soul of the nation. The forces of darkness, the forces of division, the forces of yesterday are pulling us apart, holding us down, and holding us back. We must free ourselves of all of them. As president, I will embrace hope, not fear. Peace, not violence. Generosity, not greed. Light, not darkness. I will be a president who appeals to the best in us. Not the worst. I will be a president who pushes towards the future. Not one who clings to the past. I am ready to fight for you and for our nation. Every day. Without exception, without reservation. And with a full and devoted heart. We cannot , and will not , allow extremists and white supremacists to overturn the America of Lincoln and Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. To overturn the America that has welcomed immigrants from distant shores. To overturn the America that's been a haven and a home for everyone no matter their background. From Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, we're at our best when the promise of America is available to all. We cannot and will not allow violence in the streets to threaten the people of this nation. We cannot and will not walk away from our obligation to, at long last, face the reckoning on race and racial justice in the country. We cannot and will not continue to be stuck in a partisan politics that lets this virus thrive while the public health of this nation suffers. We cannot and will not accept an economic equation that only favors those who've already got it made. Everybody deserves a shot at prosperity. Duty and history call presidents to provide for the common good. And I will. It won't be easy. Our divisions today are of long standing. Economic and racial inequities have shaped us for generations. But I give you my word: If I am elected President, I will marshal the ingenuity and good will of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together. We can disagree about how to move forward, but we must take the first step. And it starts with how we treat one another, how we talk to one another, how we respect one another. In his Second Inaugural, Lincoln said, 'With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds.' Now we have our work to reunite America, to bind up the nation's wounds, to move past shadow and suspicion. And so we , you and I, together , press on, even now. After hearing the Second Inaugural Address, Frederick Douglass told the president: 'Mr. Lincoln, that was a sacred effort.' We must be dedicated now to our own sacred effort. The promise of Gettysburg, that a new birth of freedom was at hand, is at risk. Every generation that has followed Gettysburg has been faced with a moment , when it must answer this question , whether it will allow the sacrifices made here to be in vain. This is our moment to answer this essential American question for ourselves and for our time. And my answer is this: It cannot be that after all this country has been through. After all that America has accomplished, after all the years we have stood as a beacon of light to the world, it cannot be that here and now, in 2020, we will allow government of the people, by the people, and for the people to perish from this earth. No. It cannot. It must not. We have in our hands the ultimate power: the power of the vote. It is the noblest instrument ever devised to register our will in a peaceable and productive fashion. And so we must. We must vote. And we will vote no matter how many obstacles are thrown in our way. Because once America votes, America will be heard. Lincoln said: 'The nation is worth fighting for.' So it was. So it is. Together, as one nation, under God, indivisible, let us join forces to fight the common foes of injustice and inequality, of hate and fear. Let us conduct ourselves as Americans who love each other , who love our country and who will not destroy, but will build. We owe that to the dead who are buried here at Gettysburg. And we owe that to the living and to future generations yet to be born. You and I are part of a great covenant, a common story of divisions overcome and of hope renewed. If we do our part. If we stand together. If we keep faith with the past and with each other, then the divisions of our time can give way to the dreams of a brighter, better, future. This is our work. This is our pledge. This is our mission. We can end this era of division. We can end the hate and the fear. We can be what we are at our best: The United States of America. God bless you. And may God protect our troops."}

Of the thousands of children that the Trump Administration forcibly separated from their parents as part of its cruel \"zero-tolerance\" policy, 545 children are still separated from their parents years later. This Administration ripped babies from their mother's arms, and then it seems, those parents were in many cases deported without their children and have not been found. It's an outrage, a moral failing, and a stain on our national character. There are many issues that are complicated, but some things are just black and white. Families belong together.

Of the thousands of children that the Trump Administration forcibly separated from their parents as part of its cruel 'zero-tolerance' policy, 545 children are still separated from their parents years later. This Administration ripped babies from their mother's arms, and then it seems, those parents were in many cases deported without their children and have not been found. It's an outrage, a moral failing, and a stain on our national character. There are many issues that are complicated, but some things are just black and white. Families belong together. That's the very core of my immigration policy. We can secure our borders without treating immigrants as less than human.

This failure plunged our economy into a deep recession, putting nearly unbearable strain on working people all over this country who are struggling to pay rent, to pay for their medicines and to put food on the table. Working people fighting to make ends meet in this economy don't need today's report to tell them what they already know, because they feel it everyday: Donald Trump still doesn't have a plan, and we still haven't recovered. This report underscores three inescapable truths about Donald Trump's economy: we are in a deep hole and President Trump's failure to act has meant that Q3 growth wasn't nearly enough to get us out of; the recovery is slowing if not stalling; and the recovery that is happening is helping those at the top, but leaving tens of millions of working families and small businesses behind. And with no plan to convene Congress to get a deal done to get economic relief to those who badly need it and his White House admitting they have given up on trying to get the virus under control, President Trump still has no plan to get our country through this crisis and move us forward. That's why President Trump is on track to be the first president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with fewer jobs than when he came into office. And, with today's report, we are still on track to have the worst economic downturn in more than 70 years. The American people deserve a president who will lead us out of this crisis. On top of 228,000 lost lives due to COVID-19, working people in this country are still hurting because President Trump failed to lead, failed to get this virus under control, and failed to tell the truth. I have called this a K-shaped recovery, because much of the growth we've seen has accumulated to those already well-off and has failed to reach those who need it the most. Yes, GDP rose last quarter, but visits to food banks haven't slowed, and poverty has grown. African Americans and Latinos still face double-digit unemployment rates. The added caregiving burden in the wake of Trump's failed pandemic response has forced many women to drop out of the labor force altogether. Even with today's report, GDP still remains $6,000 per household below its pre-crisis level, payrolls are down by nearly 11 million workers, and 23 million people are claiming unemployment , including 750,000 new claims last week. Today's report is not a victory for these families. American families need meaningful help, not misleading hype. Only Trump would call an already stalling economy with historic levels of unemployment claims and small businesses closures the \"best ever.\" Yet at this very moment, President Trump and his Administration are giving up on getting control of the virus. And, in doing so, they are giving up on our economy and the American people. I will fight side-by-side with the American people to rein in the virus and provide needed economic relief. Both will be day one priorities in my administration, and an independent analysis from Moody's shows that my agenda will create seven million more jobs and lead to $1 trillion higher economic growth than President Trump's plan. Success in a Biden-Harris Administration will not be measured just by the stock market or GDP growth, but by the extent to which growth is raising the pay, dignity, and economic security of our working families, especially those who have for far too long been left behind. That's why as president, I won't just bring us back to the way things were before President Trump. For too many, the old economy wasn't good enough for their family. In this recovery, I will bring everyone along, regardless of your race, your gender, your hometown, or your tax bracket. And together, we will build back better.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1478706\/todays-economic-report-statement-from-vice-president-biden&speechType=6","Summary":"Health and Health Care Economy and Fiscal","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/joebiden.com\/2020\/10\/29\/todays-economic-report-statement-from-vice-president-biden\/","CleanText":"President Trump's failure to take action this spring to get control of the coronavirus led to gutted businesses, closed schools and tens of millions of people out of work that could have been prevented.

His own Chief of Staff admitted that the Trump Administration has simply given up on trying to control the pandemic. And now, instead of implementing a plan to get the virus under control, President Trump has resorted to blaming doctors for inflating the number of COVID-19 cases. This must stop. More than 178,000 Michiganders have been infected with COVID-19, more than 7,300 have lost their lives, cases are surging, and hundreds of thousands are out of work. President Trump has failed the people of Michigan. In two days, Michiganders can get this country back on track.

They have delivered us a clear victory. A convincing victory. A victory for \"We the people.\" We have won with the most votes ever cast for a presidential ticket in the history of this nation , 74 million. I am humbled by the trust and confidence you have placed in me. I pledge to be a resident who seeks not to divide, but to unify. Who doesn't see red and blue states, but a United States. And who will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole people. For that is what America is about: the people. And that is what our administration will be about. I sought this office to restore the soul of America. To rebuild the backbone of the nation , the middle class. To make America respected around the world again and to unite us here at home. It is the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for this vision. And now the work of making this vision real is the task of our time. As I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. I would not be here without the love and tireless support of Jill, Hunter, Ashley, all of our grandchildren and their spouses, and all our family. They are my heart. Jill's a mom , a military mom , and an educator. She has dedicated her life to education, but teaching isn't just what she does , it's who she is. For America's educators, this is a great day: You're going to have one of your own in the White House, and Jill is going to make a great first lady. And I will be honored to be serving with a fantastic vice president , Kamala Harris , who will make history as the first woman, first Black woman, first woman of South Asian descent, and first daughter of immigrants ever elected to national office in this country. It's long overdue, and we're reminded tonight of all those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. But once again, America has bent the arc of the moral universe towards justice. Kamala, Doug , like it or not , you're family. You've become honorary Bidens, and there's no way out. To all those who volunteered, worked the polls in the middle of this pandemic, local election officials , you deserve a special thanks from this nation. To my campaign team, and all the volunteers, to all those who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible, I owe you everything. And to all those who supported us: I am proud of the campaign we built and ran. I am proud of the coalition we put together, the broadest and most diverse in history. Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Progressives, moderates and conservatives. Young and old. Urban, suburban and rural. Gay, straight, transgender. White. Latino. Asian. Native American. And especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest , the African American community stood up again for me. They always have my back, and I'll have yours. I said from the outset I wanted a campaign that represented America, and I think we did that. Now that's what I want the administration to look like. And to those who voted for President Trump, I understand your disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of elections myself. But now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric. To lower the temperature. To see each other again. To listen to each other again. To make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy. We are not enemies. We are Americans. The Bible tells us that to everything there is a season , a time to build, a time to reap, a time to sow. And a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now that the campaign is over , what is the people's will? What is our mandate? I believe it is this: Americans have called on us to marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness. To marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time. The battle to control the virus. The battle to build prosperity. The battle to secure your family's healthcare. The battle to achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country. The battle to save the climate. The battle to restore decency, defend democracy and give everybody in this country a fair shot. Our work begins with getting COVID under control. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments , hugging a grandchild, birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us , until we get this virus under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as Transition Advisors to help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint that starts on January 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on a bedrock of science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern. I will spare no effort , or commitment , to turn this pandemic around. I ran as a proud Democrat. I will now be an American president. I will work as hard for those who didn't vote for me , as those who did. Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end , here and now. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision. It's a choice we make. And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate from the American people. They want us to cooperate. That's the choice I'll make. And I call on the Congress , Democrats and Republicans alike , to make that choice with me. The American story is about the slow, yet steady widening of opportunity. Make no mistake: Too many dreams have been deferred for too long. We must make the promise of the country real for everybody , no matter their race, their ethnicity, their faith, their identity or their disability. America has always been shaped by inflection points , by moments in time where we've made hard decisions about who we are and what we want to be. Lincoln in 1860 , coming to save the Union. FDR in 1932 , promising a beleaguered country a New Deal. JFK in 1960 , pledging a New Frontier. And 12 years ago , when Barack Obama made history , and told us, \"Yes, we can.\" We stand again at an inflection point. We have the opportunity to defeat despair and to build a nation of prosperity and purpose. We can do it. I know we can. I've long talked about the battle for the soul of America. We must restore the soul of America. Our nation is shaped by the constant battle between our better angels and our darkest impulses. It is time for our better angels to prevail. Tonight, the whole world is watching America. I believe at our best, America is a beacon for the globe. And we lead not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. I've always believed we can define America in one word: possibilities. That in America everyone should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them. You see, I believe in the possibility of this country. We're always looking ahead. Ahead to an America that's freer and more just. Ahead to an America that creates jobs with dignity and respect. Ahead to an America that cures disease , like cancer and Alzheimer's. Ahead to an America that never leaves anyone behind. Ahead to an America that never gives up, never gives in. This is a great nation. And we are a good people. This is the United States of America. And there has never been anything we haven't been able to do when we've done it together. In the last days of the campaign, I've been thinking about a hymn that means a lot to me and to my family, particularly my deceased son Beau. It captures the faith that sustains me and which I believe sustains America. And I hope it can provide some comfort and solace to the more than 230,000 families who have lost a loved one to this terrible virus this year. My heart goes out to each and every one of you. Hopefully this hymn gives you solace as well. \"And He will raise you up on eagle's wings, Bear you on the breath of dawn, Make you to shine like the sun, And hold you in the palm of His Hand.\" And now, together , on eagle's wings , we embark on the work that God and history have called upon us to do. With full hearts and steady hands, with faith in America and in each other, with a love of country , and a thirst for justice , let us be the nation that we know we can be. A nation united. A nation strengthened. A nation healed. The United States of America. God bless you.

{"SpeechID":"VSJB10112020188","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-11-10","SpeechTitle":"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by President-elect Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware","Type":"speech","RawText":"Good afternoon, everyone. This morning the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case of grave importance to all Americans. This case represents the latest attempt by far-right ideologues to do what they have repeatedly failed to do , in the courts, in Congress, and in the court of public opinion over the last decade: eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act. Twice already, the Supreme Court has upheld this landmark law , in 2012 and 2015. And the Congress, expressing the popular will of the American people and on a bipartisan basis, has rejected the numerous efforts of President Trump to erase the law as well. Now, in the midst of a deadly pandemic that has infected more than 10 million Americans , nearly one out of every 32 of our people , often with devastating consequences to their health; these ideologues are once again trying to strip health coverage away. The goal of the outgoing Administration is clear from the brief they filed with the Court. It asserts, quote: \"The entire ACA thus must fall.\" Now, I'm not naive about the fact that health care is an issue that has divided Americans in the past. But the truth is, the American people are more united on this issue today than they are divided. As recently as last month, a leading survey found that Americans want to keep the Affordable Care Act in place by an overwhelming margin of 22 percent. Seventy-nine percent of Americans , including nine out of ten Democrats, eight out of ten Independents, and two-thirds of Republicans , want to keep the ACA's protections for people with pre-existing conditions, which would be eliminated if this lawsuit were to succeed. This doesn't need to be a partisan issue. This is a human issue. It affects every single American family. And we can't subvert the growing consensus of the American people based on arguments put forward in the briefs seeking to invalidate the law that even many conservative legal scholars, including in the National Review, consider to be ridiculous. Let's be absolutely clear about what's at stake here. The consequences of the Trump Administration's argument are not academic or an abstraction. For many Americans, they are a matter of life and death. This argument will determine whether the health coverage of more than 20 million Americans will be ripped away in the middle of the worst public health crisis in a century. Whether 100 million people with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes, and cancer could once again be denied coverage. Whether complications from COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, will become the next flood of pre-existing conditions that could be used as an excuse to jack up premiums or deny coverage altogether for millions of survivors who have struggled and won the fight of their lives against coronavirus. This argument will determine whether women can once again be charged higher premiums just because they are women. Whether seniors will see their prescription drug prices go up. Whether kids will still be able to stay on their parents' plans up to age 26. And whether annual and lifetime limits on your benefits will be re-imposed. This isn't hyperbole , this is real. As real as it gets. When a family is faced with that awful news of a child diagnosed with leukemia, a mom forced to battle against breast cancer, an accident that leaves a loved one unable to live the life they've always known , it stops your heart. It wrenches your entire world off of its axis. Believe me , I know that feeling. Too many American families do. And in that moment, the very last thing on your mind , the very last thing that should be on your mind , is whether you can afford treatment. The Affordable Care Act was created to put a stop to that inhumanity. It was created to ensure that families thrust into the worst nightmare of their lives could focus not on money, but on the fight that really matters. Obamacare is a law that every American should be proud of. It's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It's a law that delivered vital coverage to more than 20 million Americans. It's a law that reduced prescription drug costs for nearly 12 million seniors. It's a law that has saved lives and spared countless families from financial ruin. So this effort to bypass the will of the people, the verdict of the courts, and the judgment of Congress is simply cruel and needlessly divisive. But regardless of the outcome of this case, I promise you this: Beginning on January 20th, Vice President-elect Harris and I are going to do everything in our power to ease the burden of health care on you and your families. That starts by building on the Affordable Care Act with a dramatic expansion of health coverage and bold steps to lower health care costs. My transition team will soon be starting its work to flesh out the details so that we can hit the ground running tackling costs, increasing access, and lowering the price of prescription drugs. Families are reeling right now, enduring illnesses; forced into risky choices; losing their employer plans in droves. They need a lifeline now. They shouldn't have to hold their breath, waiting to see if the Supreme Court is going to wrench away the peace of mind they've come to rely on. So we are going to get right to work, addressing the issues that families are talking about around their kitchen tables. Making sure that they can go to bed at night with the peace of mind they deserve. And fulfilling our moral obligation to ensure that, here in America, health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the few. So, come January, we will work quickly with Congress to dramatically ramp up health care protections, get America to universal coverage, and lower health care costs as soon as humanly possible. That is our promise to you: we will fight for your family's health coverage the same way we would fight for our own. And we want every single American to know, if you're sick; if you're struggling; if you're worried about how you're going to get through the day , We will not abandon you. We will not leave you to face these challenges alone. We are going to get through this together. And we are going to build a health care system that puts you and your family first and that every American can be proud of. Thank you. God bless you and may God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1482983\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Health Insurance Judicial Branch","Source":null,"Location":"Wilmington, DE","Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.com\/speeches\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware\/","CleanText":"Good afternoon, everyone.

Twice already, the Supreme Court has upheld this landmark law , in 2012 and 2015. And the Congress, expressing the popular will of the American people and on a bipartisan basis, has rejected the numerous efforts of President Trump to erase the law as well. Now, in the midst of a deadly pandemic that has infected more than 10 million Americans , nearly one out of every 32 of our people , often with devastating consequences to their health; these ideologues are once again trying to strip health coverage away. The goal of the outgoing Administration is clear from the brief they filed with the Court. It asserts, quote: 'The entire ACA thus must fall.' Now, I'm not naive about the fact that health care is an issue that has divided Americans in the past. But the truth is, the American people are more united on this issue today than they are divided. As recently as last month, a leading survey found that Americans want to keep the Affordable Care Act in place by an overwhelming margin of 22 percent. Seventy-nine percent of Americans , including nine out of ten Democrats, eight out of ten Independents, and two-thirds of Republicans , want to keep the ACA's protections for people with pre-existing conditions, which would be eliminated if this lawsuit were to succeed. This doesn't need to be a partisan issue. This is a human issue. It affects every single American family. And we can't subvert the growing consensus of the American people based on arguments put forward in the briefs seeking to invalidate the law that even many conservative legal scholars, including in the National Review, consider to be ridiculous. Let's be absolutely clear about what's at stake here. The consequences of the Trump Administration's argument are not academic or an abstraction. For many Americans, they are a matter of life and death. This argument will determine whether the health coverage of more than 20 million Americans will be ripped away in the middle of the worst public health crisis in a century. Whether 100 million people with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes, and cancer could once again be denied coverage. Whether complications from COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, will become the next flood of pre-existing conditions that could be used as an excuse to jack up premiums or deny coverage altogether for millions of survivors who have struggled and won the fight of their lives against coronavirus. This argument will determine whether women can once again be charged higher premiums just because they are women. Whether seniors will see their prescription drug prices go up. Whether kids will still be able to stay on their parents' plans up to age 26. And whether annual and lifetime limits on your benefits will be re-imposed. This isn't hyperbole , this is real. As real as it gets. When a family is faced with that awful news of a child diagnosed with leukemia, a mom forced to battle against breast cancer, an accident that leaves a loved one unable to live the life they've always known , it stops your heart. It wrenches your entire world off of its axis. Believe me , I know that feeling. Too many American families do. And in that moment, the very last thing on your mind , the very last thing that should be on your mind , is whether you can afford treatment. The Affordable Care Act was created to put a stop to that inhumanity. It was created to ensure that families thrust into the worst nightmare of their lives could focus not on money, but on the fight that really matters. Obamacare is a law that every American should be proud of. It's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It's a law that delivered vital coverage to more than 20 million Americans. It's a law that reduced prescription drug costs for nearly 12 million seniors. It's a law that has saved lives and spared countless families from financial ruin. So this effort to bypass the will of the people, the verdict of the courts, and the judgment of Congress is simply cruel and needlessly divisive. But regardless of the outcome of this case, I promise you this: Beginning on January 20th, Vice President-elect Harris and I are going to do everything in our power to ease the burden of health care on you and your families. That starts by building on the Affordable Care Act with a dramatic expansion of health coverage and bold steps to lower health care costs. My transition team will soon be starting its work to flesh out the details so that we can hit the ground running tackling costs, increasing access, and lowering the price of prescription drugs. Families are reeling right now, enduring illnesses; forced into risky choices; losing their employer plans in droves. They need a lifeline now. They shouldn't have to hold their breath, waiting to see if the Supreme Court is going to wrench away the peace of mind they've come to rely on. So we are going to get right to work, addressing the issues that families are talking about around their kitchen tables. Making sure that they can go to bed at night with the peace of mind they deserve. And fulfilling our moral obligation to ensure that, here in America, health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the few. So, come January, we will work quickly with Congress to dramatically ramp up health care protections, get America to universal coverage, and lower health care costs as soon as humanly possible. That is our promise to you: we will fight for your family's health coverage the same way we would fight for our own. And we want every single American to know, if you're sick; if you're struggling; if you're worried about how you're going to get through the day , We will not abandon you. We will not leave you to face these challenges alone. We are going to get through this together. And we are going to build a health care system that puts you and your family first and that every American can be proud of. Thank you. God bless you and may God protect our troops."}

They stand as part of a proud chain of warrior patriots reaching back to the earliest days of our republic, each one taking up the sacred mission to defend our nation's highest values, our liberty, and democracy. The women and men who have fought and sacrificed for our country are heroes, and the rest of us owe them an unpayable debt. They have earned our thanks and, above all, our respect. For many years, I have said that we as a nation have many obligations, but we have only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare and equip our troops we send into harm's way, and to care for them and their families when they return home. For our veterans, that means providing a future of security, opportunity, and dignity; world class health care provided by the VA, with women and LGBTQ+ veterans receiving culturally competent care; and addressing the mental health crises and epidemic of suicide that are claiming too many of our veterans and service members. We have to make clear to everyone suffering from unseen wounds that there is honor and strength in reaching out for help. And we have to make sure that no veteran is locked out of treatment for conditions related to toxic exposures or traumatic brain injuries experienced in the line of duty. Fulfilling our promises to our veterans and military families, caregivers, and survivors is critical to our national security, because it is how we will ensure that future generations continue to volunteer to serve. For the Biden family, this is also a personal commitment. We learned what it really means to be part of a military family the year that Beau deployed to Iraq with his National Guard unit. We prayed every night and morning for his safety, and we missed him at every family gathering or when tucking his children in at night. It was hard. It hurt. These are challenges most American families never have to face. And yet, Jill and I were constantly in awe when visiting with wounded service members at Christmas or hosting veterans in our home for dinners, at the pride our military members and veterans feel in their service, and at their matchless sense of duty. They are the absolute best of our country. This Veterans Day, I feel the full weight of the honor and the responsibility that has been entrusted to me by the American people as the next president, and I vow to honor our country's sacred obligation. To all of our proud veterans, know that I will be a commander in chief who respects your sacrifice, understands your service, and who will never betray the values you fought so bravely to defend. I will never treat you or your families with anything less than the honor you deserve.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1483035\/statement-from-president-elect-biden-on-veterans-day&speechType=6","Summary":"Veterans","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.com\/press-releases\/statement-from-president-elect-biden-on-veterans-day\/","CleanText":"Today, we as a nation pause to honor the service, the valor, and the commitment of all those who have worn the uniform of the Armed Forces of the United States.

{"SpeechID":"VSJB25112020187","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-11-25","SpeechTitle":"Thanksgiving Address as Prepared for Delivery by President-elect Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware","Type":"speech","RawText":"My fellow Americans: Thanksgiving is a special time in America. A time to reflect on what the year has brought, and to think about what lies ahead. The first national day of Thanksgiving, authorized by the Continental Congress, took place on December 18th, 1777. It was celebrated by General George Washington and his troops at Gulph Mills on the way to Valley Forge. It took place under harsh conditions and deprivations , lacking food, clothing, shelter. They were preparing to ride out a long hard winter. Today, you can find a plaque in Gulph Mills marking that moment. It reads in part , \"This Thanksgiving in spite of the suffering-showed the reverence and character that was forging the soul of a nation.\" Forging the soul of a nation. Faith, courage, sacrifice, service to country, service to each other, and gratitude even in the face of suffering, have long been part of what Thanksgiving means in America. Looking back over our history you'll see that it's been in the most difficult of circumstances that the soul of our nation has been forged. Now, we find ourselves again facing a long, hard winter. We have fought a nearly year-long battle with a virus in this nation. It's brought us pain and loss and frustration, and it has cost so many lives. 260,000 Americans , and counting. It has divided us. Angered us. And set us against one another. I know the country has grown weary of the fight. But we need to remember we're at a war with a virus , not with each other. This is the moment where we need to steel our spines, redouble our efforts, and recommit ourselves to the fight. Let's remember , we are all in this together. For so many of us, it's hard to hear that this fight isn't over, that we still have months of this battle ahead of us. And for those who have lost loved ones, I know this time of year is especially difficult. Believe me, I know. I remember that first Thanksgiving. The empty chair, the silence. It takes your breath away. It's hard to care. It's hard to give thanks. It's hard to look forward. And it's so hard to hope. I understand. I will be thinking and praying for each and every one of you at our Thanksgiving table because we've been there. This year, we're asking Americans to forego many of the traditions that have long made this holiday such a special one. For our family, we've had a 40 plus year tradition of traveling over Thanksgiving, a tradition we've kept every year save one , the year after our son Beau died. But this year, we'll be staying home. We have always had big family gatherings at Thanksgiving. Kids, grandkids, aunts, uncles, and more. For the Bidens, the days around Thanksgiving have always been a time to remember all we had to be grateful for, and a time to welcome the Christmas Season. But this year, because we care so much for each other, we're going to be having separate Thanksgivings. For Jill and I, we'll be at home in Delaware with our daughter and son-in-law. So, I know. I know how hard it is to forego family traditions, but it is so very important. Our country is in the middle of a dramatic spike in cases. We're now averaging over 160,000 new cases a day. And no one will be surprised if we hit 200,000 cases in a single day. Many local health systems are at risk of being overwhelmed. That is the plain and simple truth, and I believe you deserve to always hear the truth from your president. We have to try to slow the growth of the virus. We owe that to the doctors, the nurses, and the other front-line health care workers who have risked so much and heroically battled this virus for so long. We owe that to our fellow citizens who will need access to hospital beds and the care to fight this disease. And we owe it to one another , it's our patriotic duty as Americans. That means wearing masks, keeping social distancing, and limiting the size of any groups we're in. Until we have a vaccine, these are our most effective tools to combat the virus. Starting on Day One of my presidency, we will take steps that will change the courseof the disease. More testing will find people with cases and get them away from other people, slowing the number of infections. More protective gear for businesses and schools will do the same , reducing the number of cases. Clear guidance will get more businesses and more schools open. We all have a role to play in beating this crisis. The federal government has vast powers to combat this virus. And I commit to you I will use all those powers to lead a national coordinated response. But the federal government can't do it alone. Each of us has a responsibility in our own livesto do what we can to slow the virus. Every decision we make matters. Every decision we make can save a life. None of these steps we're asking people to take are political statements. Every one of them is based in science. The good news is, that there has been significant, record-breaking progress made recently in developing a vaccine. Several of these vaccines look to be extraordinarily effective. And it appears that we are on track for the first immunizations to begin by late December or early January. Then, we will need to put in place a distribution plan to get the entire country immunized as soon as possible, which we will do. But it's going to take time. I'm hoping the news of a vaccine will serve as an incentive to every American to take these simple steps to get control of this virus. There is real hope, tangible hope. So hang on. Don't let yourself surrender to the fatigue. I know we can and we will beat this virus. America is not going to lose this war. You will get your lives back. Life is going to return to normal. That will happen. This will not last forever. So yes, this has been a hard year, but I still believe we have much to be thankful for. Much to hope for. Much to build upon. Much to dream of. Here's the America I see, and I believe it's the America you see, too: An America that faces facts. An America that overcomes challenges. An America where we seek justice and equality for all people. An America that holds fast to the conviction that out of pain comes possibility; out of frustration, progress; out of division, unity. In our finest hours, that's who we've always been, and it's who we shall be again, for I believe that this grim season of division and demonization will give way to a year of light and unity. Why do I think so? Because America is a nation not of adversaries, but of neighbors. Not of limitation, but of possibility. Not of dreams deferred, but of dreams realized. I've said it many times: This is a great country and we are a good people. This is the United States of America. And there has never been anything we haven't been able to do when we've done it together. Think of what we've come through: centuries of human enslavement; a cataclysmic Civil War; the exclusion of women from the ballot box; World Wars; Jim Crow; a long twilight struggle against Soviet tyranny that could have ended not with the fall of the Berlin Wall, but in nuclear Armageddon. I'm not na\u00efve. I know that history is just that: history. But to know what's come before can help arm us against despair. Knowing the previous generations got through the same universal human challenges that we face: the tension between selfishness and generosity, between fear and hope, between division and unity. And what was it that brought the reality of America into closer alignment with its promise of equality, justice, and prosperity? It was love. Plain and simple. Love of country and love for one another. We don't talk much about love in our politics. The public arena is too loud, too angry, too heated. To love our neighbors as ourselves is a radical act, yet it's what we're called to do. And we must try, for only in trying, only in listening, only in seeing ourselves as bound together in what Dr. King called a \"mutual garment of destiny\" can we rise above our divisions and truly heal. America has never been perfect. But we've always tried to fulfill the aspiration of the Declaration of Independence: that all people are created equal, created in the image of God. And we have always sought \"to form that more perfect union.\" What should we give thanks for in this season? First, let us be thankful for democracy itself. In this election year, we have seen record numbers of Americans exercise their most sacred right , that of the vote , to register their will at the ballot box. Think about that. In the middle of a pandemic, more people voted this year than have ever voted in the history of America. Over 150 million people cast a ballot. That is simply extraordinary. If you want to know what beats deep in the heart of America, it's this: democracy. The right to determine our lives, our government, our leaders. The right to be heard. Our democracy was tested this year. And what we learned is this: The people of this nation are up to the task. In America, we have full and fair and free elections, and then we honor the results. The people of this nation and the laws of the land won't stand for anything else. Through the vote , the noblest instrument of nonviolent protest ever conceived , we are reminded anew that progress is possible. That \"We the People\" have the power to change what Jefferson called \"the course of human events.\" That with our hearts and hands and voices, today can be better than yesterday, and tomorrow can be better still. We should be thankful, too, that America is a covenant and an unfolding story. We have what we need to create prosperity, opportunity and justice: Americans have grit and generosity, a capacity for greatness and reservoirs of goodness. We have what it takes. Now we must act. And this is our moment , ours together , to write a newer, bolder, more compassionatechapter in the life of our nation. The work ahead will not be easy. And it will not be quick. You want solutions, not shouting. Reason, not hyper-partisanship. Light, not heat. You want us to hear one another again, see one another again, respect one another again. You want us , Democrats and Republicans and Independents , to come together and work together. And that, my friends, is what I am determined to do. Americans dream big. And, as hard as it may seem this Thanksgiving, we are going to dream big again. Our future is bright. In fact, I have never been more optimistic about the future of America than I am right now. I believe the 21st Century is going to be an American Century. We are going to build an economy that leads the world. We are going to lead the world by the power of our example , not the example of our power. We are going to lead the world on climate and save the planet. We are going to find cures for cancer and Alzheimer's and diabetes. And we are going to finally root out systemic racism in our country. On this Thanksgiving, and in anticipation of all the Thanksgivings to come, let us dream again. Let us commit ourselves to thinking not only of ourselves but of others. For if we care for one another , if we open our arms rather than brandish our fists , we can, with God's help, heal. And if we do, and I am sure we can, we can proclaim with the Psalmist who wrote: \"The Lord is my strength and my shield and with my song I give thanks to him.\" And I give thanks now: for you and for the trust you have placed in me. Together, we will lift our voices in the coming months and years, and our song shall be of lives saved, breaches repaired, and a nation made whole. From the Biden family to yours, wherever and however you may be celebrating, we wish you a Happy Thanksgiving. God bless you, and may God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1487895\/thanksgiving-address-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Health and Health Care Arts, Entertainment, and History","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/thanksgiving-address-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware\/","CleanText":"My fellow Americans: Thanksgiving is a special time in America. A time to reflect on what the year has brought, and to think about what lies ahead. The first national day of Thanksgiving, authorized by the Continental Congress, took place on December 18th, 1777. It was celebrated by General George Washington and his troops at Gulph Mills on the way to Valley Forge. It took place under harsh conditions and deprivations , lacking food, clothing, shelter. They were preparing to ride out a long hard winter. Today, you can find a plaque in Gulph Mills marking that moment. It reads in part , 'This Thanksgiving in spite of the suffering-showed the reverence and character that was forging the soul of a nation.' Forging the soul of a nation. Faith, courage, sacrifice, service to country, service to each other, and gratitude even in the face of suffering, have long been part of what Thanksgiving means in America. Looking back over our history you'll see that it's been in the most difficult of circumstances that the soul of our nation has been forged. Now, we find ourselves again facing a long, hard winter. We have fought a nearly year-long battle with a virus in this nation. It's brought us pain and loss and frustration, and it has cost so many lives. 260,000 Americans , and counting. It has divided us. Angered us. And set us against one another. I know the country has grown weary of the fight. But we need to remember we're at a war with a virus , not with each other. This is the moment where we need to steel our spines, redouble our efforts, and recommit ourselves to the fight. Let's remember , we are all in this together. For so many of us, it's hard to hear that this fight isn't over, that we still have months of this battle ahead of us. And for those who have lost loved ones, I know this time of year is especially difficult. Believe me, I know. I remember that first Thanksgiving. The empty chair, the silence. It takes your breath away. It's hard to care. It's hard to give thanks. It's hard to look forward. And it's so hard to hope. I understand. I will be thinking and praying for each and every one of you at our Thanksgiving table because we've been there. This year, we're asking Americans to forego many of the traditions that have long made this holiday such a special one. For our family, we've had a 40 plus year tradition of traveling over Thanksgiving, a tradition we've kept every year save one , the year after our son Beau died. But this year, we'll be staying home. We have always had big family gatherings at Thanksgiving. Kids, grandkids, aunts, uncles, and more. For the Bidens, the days around Thanksgiving have always been a time to remember all we had to be grateful for, and a time to welcome the Christmas Season. But this year, because we care so much for each other, we're going to be having separate Thanksgivings. For Jill and I, we'll be at home in Delaware with our daughter and son-in-law. So, I know. I know how hard it is to forego family traditions, but it is so very important. Our country is in the middle of a dramatic spike in cases. We're now averaging over 160,000 new cases a day. And no one will be surprised if we hit 200,000 cases in a single day. Many local health systems are at risk of being overwhelmed. That is the plain and simple truth, and I believe you deserve to always hear the truth from your president. We have to try to slow the growth of the virus. We owe that to the doctors, the nurses, and the other front-line health care workers who have risked so much and heroically battled this virus for so long. We owe that to our fellow citizens who will need access to hospital beds and the care to fight this disease. And we owe it to one another , it's our patriotic duty as Americans. That means wearing masks, keeping social distancing, and limiting the size of any groups we're in. Until we have a vaccine, these are our most effective tools to combat the virus. Starting on Day One of my presidency, we will take steps that will change the courseof the disease. More testing will find people with cases and get them away from other people, slowing the number of infections. More protective gear for businesses and schools will do the same , reducing the number of cases. Clear guidance will get more businesses and more schools open. We all have a role to play in beating this crisis. The federal government has vast powers to combat this virus. And I commit to you I will use all those powers to lead a national coordinated response. But the federal government can't do it alone. Each of us has a responsibility in our own livesto do what we can to slow the virus. Every decision we make matters. Every decision we make can save a life. None of these steps we're asking people to take are political statements. Every one of them is based in science. The good news is, that there has been significant, record-breaking progress made recently in developing a vaccine. Several of these vaccines look to be extraordinarily effective. And it appears that we are on track for the first immunizations to begin by late December or early January. Then, we will need to put in place a distribution plan to get the entire country immunized as soon as possible, which we will do. But it's going to take time. I'm hoping the news of a vaccine will serve as an incentive to every American to take these simple steps to get control of this virus. There is real hope, tangible hope. So hang on. Don't let yourself surrender to the fatigue. I know we can and we will beat this virus. America is not going to lose this war. You will get your lives back. Life is going to return to normal. That will happen. This will not last forever. So yes, this has been a hard year, but I still believe we have much to be thankful for. Much to hope for. Much to build upon. Much to dream of. Here's the America I see, and I believe it's the America you see, too: An America that faces facts. An America that overcomes challenges. An America where we seek justice and equality for all people. An America that holds fast to the conviction that out of pain comes possibility; out of frustration, progress; out of division, unity. In our finest hours, that's who we've always been, and it's who we shall be again, for I believe that this grim season of division and demonization will give way to a year of light and unity. Why do I think so? Because America is a nation not of adversaries, but of neighbors. Not of limitation, but of possibility. Not of dreams deferred, but of dreams realized. I've said it many times: This is a great country and we are a good people. This is the United States of America. And there has never been anything we haven't been able to do when we've done it together.

I hope everyone had a safe and enjoyable Thanksgiving even if it was far from tradition and apart from the ones we love. I know times are tough, but I want you to know that help is on the way. Last week, I announced nominations and staff for critical foreign policy and national security positions. A first-rate team that will keep us safe and secure. Today, I am pleased to announce key nominations and appointments for critical economic positions in the Administration. A first-rate team that will get us through the on-going economic crisis and help us build our economy back better than before. This team is tested and experienced. It includes groundbreaking Americans who come from different backgrounds, but share my core economic vision. That given a fair shot and equal chance, there's nothing beyond the capacityof the American people. Let's not forget that the middle class built this country and unions built the middle class. And from the most unequal economic and jobs crisis in modern history, we can build a new American economy that works for all Americans. But we need to act now. And we have to work together. In the weeks since winning the election, Vice President-elect Harris and I have convened meetings with labor leaders and CEOs and Mayors and Governors of both parties. There is consensus that, as we battle COVID-19, we have to make sure that businesses and workers have the tools, resources, guidance, and health and safety standards to operate safely. Our goal is simple: to keep businesses and schools open safely. For the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs , or hours , and have had to claim unemployment, we have to deliver them immediate relief. This includes affordable health care for millions of people who have lost it or are in danger of losing it. Child care, sick leave, family leave, so workers don't have to choose between work and family. Relief from rent and student loans. We need to support small businesses and entrepreneurs that form the backbone of our communities but are teetering on the edge. There's an urgent need to fund states and cities, so they can keep frontline workers on the job. We must keep vital public services running , law enforcement officers, firefighters, educators , as we did with the Recovery Act in 2009. Right now, the full Congress should come together and pass a robust package of relief that addresses these urgent needs. But any package passed in the lame duck session is likely to be , at best , just the start. My transition team is already working on what I will put forward for the next Congressto address the multiple crises we are facing , especially our economic and COVID crises. And the team I'm announcing today will play a critical role in shaping our plan for action , starting on Day One , to move fast and revive the economy. They will help lay out my Build Back Better plan; a plan that an independent analysis by Moody's , a well-respected Wall Street firm , projects will create 18.6 million jobs. It's based on a simple premise: reward hard work in America , not wealth. It's time we invest in infrastructure, clean energy and climate change, manufacturing, and so much more that will create millions of good paying American jobs. And it's time we address the structural inequalities in our economy that the pandemic has laid bare. Economists call the current recovery \"K-shaped.\" Like the two lines coming out of a K, some people are seeing their prospects soar up while most others are watching their economic well-being drop sharply. For those at the top, jobs have come back and their wealth is rising. For example, luxury home sales are up over 40 percent compared to last year. But for those in the middle and the bottom, it's a downward slide. They're left figuring out how to pay bills and put food on the table. Almost one in every six renters was behind on rent payments as of late October. Let me be clear, with this team and the others who we will add in the weeks ahead, we will create a recovery for all and get this economy moving again. We will create jobs, raise incomes, reduce drug prices, advance racial equity across the economy, and restore the backbone of this country , the middle class. Our message to everyone struggling right now is this , help is on the way. After my Dad lost his job in Scranton, Pennsylvania -and eventually moved the family not far from here in Claymont, Delaware, he'd say, \"Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about dignity. Respect. Your place in the community. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say that everything will be okay.\" He also used to say, \"Joey, I don't expect the government to solve my problems. But I expect it to understand my problems.\" This team understands. For Secretary of the Treasury, I nominate Janet Yellen. No one is better prepared for this crisis. She will be the first Treasury Secretary who was also Chair of the Federal Reserve, Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, and Chair of the President's Council of Economic Advisors. Janet is one of the most important economic thinkers of our time. She has spent her career focused on employment and the dignity of work. She understands what a job means to people and their communities. Respected across party lines and around the world, by Main Street and Wall Street. An educator, a mentor. Above all , the daughter of a working-class Brooklyn neighborhood who never forgot where she came from. Her husband, George, is pretty good too. He is a Nobel Prize recipient, but he's the one who married up. Janet will be the first woman to hold this office. We might have to ask Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote a musical about the first Treasury Secretary, Hamilton, to write another musical for the first woman Treasury Secretary, Yellen. For Director of the Office and Management and Budget, I nominate Neera Tanden. I've known Neera for a long time. A brilliant policy mind with critical practical experience across government. She was raised by a single mom on food stamps, an immigrant from India who struggled, worked hard, and did everything she could for her daughter to live out her American dream. And Neera did just that. She understands the struggles that millions of Americans are facing. And she will be the first woman of color and first South Asian American to lead the OMB. She will be in charge of laying out my budget that will help us control the virus, deal with the economic crisis, and build back better. But above all, she believes what I believe , a budget should reflect our values. For Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, I nominate Wally Adeyemo. A skilled leader and thinker on issues ranging from macroeconomics to consumer protection, and from national security to international affairs. I worked with Wally during the Great Recession, and I saw him tackle one big job after another. Deputy National Security Advisor to President Obama. Deputy Director of the National Economic Council. Former Chief of Staff to Elizabeth Warren, where he helped create the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau. It's designed to protect consumers and working people from unfair, deceptive, and abusive financial practices. And now, Wally will be the first African American ever to hold this post, and the highest-ranking African American in Treasury Department history. An immigrant from Nigeria, a son of a nurse and an elementary school principal, Wally understands everything we do is for the people. To understand their struggles, and most of all, their dreams. For Chairperson of the Council of Economic Advisors, I nominate Cecilia \"CC\" Rouse, one of the most distinguished economists in the country. An expert on labor economics, race, poverty, and education. Dean of Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs. Member of the Council of Economic Advisors to President Obama. Advisor to President Clinton at the National Economic Council. More than that, she's a proud daughter. Whose mom , a school psychologist , encouraged her to pursue economics. Whose dad , one of the country's first African American astrophysicists , who dared her to dream. If confirmed, CC will be just the fourth woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisors and the first African-American ever to hold the post. And as CEA Chair, she will serve as a member of my Cabinet. As a member of the Council of Economic Advisors, I appoint Jared Bernstein. A brilliant thinker with a quick wit , and a big heart he got from his mom , an educator , who raised him right. A social worker turned economist, Jared is one of my closest economic advisors. He served as my Chief Economist during my Vice Presidency. He was there in the foxhole during the Great Recession with the economy on the brink and our country on its back. I couldn't think of anyone else who I would want by my side to face the challenges ahead. Jared will be one of the leading voices of my Administration on economic policy. I can always count on him to deliver it straight from the shoulder as his hero FDR said. One thing I can assure you is working people will always have a voice with Jared on the Council. As a member of the Council of Economic Advisors, I appoint Heather Boushey. She is one of the foremost economists working to make sure we build an economy that works for all Americans. A daughter of a union family , it's no wonder she believes so deeply in the idea: leave no one out, leave no one behind. During the campaign, I relied on her counsel on addressing the structural inequalities in our economy. I'll do so again as President because it is a central issue of our time. To this team , thank you for accepting the call to serve. To your families , thank you for your sacrifice. We could not do this without you. And to the American people, this team will always be there for you and your families. Eleven years ago President Obama and I entered office during the Great Recession and implemented the Recovery Act that saved us from a Great Depression. We didn't see the map of America in terms of blue states and red states. We only saw the United States of America. We worked with everyone , for everyone. And we recovered and rebuilt , together , as one nation. Vice President-elect Harris and I will do it again with this outstanding team. They are ready on Day One. To the United States Senate , I hope these outstanding nominees will receive a prompt hearing, and that we will be able to work across the aisle in good faith and move forward as one country. Let us begin the work to heal, unite, and rebuild an economy for all Americans. They deserve and expect nothing less. Thank you. May God bless you. May God protect our troops. I'll now turn it over to the new team, starting with our next Secretary of the Treasury , Janet Yellen.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1488301\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Executive Branch Economy and Fiscal","Source":null,"Location":"Wilmington, DE","Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware-2\/","CleanText":"Good afternoon.

Right now, the full Congress should come together and pass a robust package of relief that addresses these urgent needs. But any package passed in the lame duck session is likely to be , at best , just the start. My transition team is already working on what I will put forward for the next Congressto address the multiple crises we are facing , especially our economic and COVID crises. And the team I'm announcing today will play a critical role in shaping our plan for action , starting on Day One , to move fast and revive the economy. They will help lay out my Build Back Better plan; a plan that an independent analysis by Moody's , a well-respected Wall Street firm , projects will create 18.6 million jobs. It's based on a simple premise: reward hard work in America , not wealth. It's time we invest in infrastructure, clean energy and climate change, manufacturing, and so much more that will create millions of good paying American jobs. And it's time we address the structural inequalities in our economy that the pandemic has laid bare. Economists call the current recovery 'K-shaped.' Like the two lines coming out of a K, some people are seeing their prospects soar up while most others are watching their economic well-being drop sharply. For those at the top, jobs have come back and their wealth is rising. For example, luxury home sales are up over 40 percent compared to last year. But for those in the middle and the bottom, it's a downward slide. They're left figuring out how to pay bills and put food on the table. Almost one in every six renters was behind on rent payments as of late October. Let me be clear, with this team and the others who we will add in the weeks ahead, we will create a recovery for all and get this economy moving again. We will create jobs, raise incomes, reduce drug prices, advance racial equity across the economy, and restore the backbone of this country , the middle class. Our message to everyone struggling right now is this , help is on the way. After my Dad lost his job in Scranton, Pennsylvania -and eventually moved the family not far from here in Claymont, Delaware, he'd say, 'Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about dignity. Respect. Your place in the community. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say that everything will be okay.' He also used to say, 'Joey, I don't expect the government to solve my problems. But I expect it to understand my problems.' This team understands. For Secretary of the Treasury, I nominate Janet Yellen. No one is better prepared for this crisis. She will be the first Treasury Secretary who was also Chair of the Federal Reserve, Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, and Chair of the President's Council of Economic Advisors. Janet is one of the most important economic thinkers of our time. She has spent her career focused on employment and the dignity of work. She understands what a job means to people and their communities. Respected across party lines and around the world, by Main Street and Wall Street. An educator, a mentor. Above all , the daughter of a working-class Brooklyn neighborhood who never forgot where she came from. Her husband, George, is pretty good too. He is a Nobel Prize recipient, but he's the one who married up. Janet will be the first woman to hold this office. We might have to ask Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote a musical about the first Treasury Secretary, Hamilton, to write another musical for the first woman Treasury Secretary, Yellen. For Director of the Office and Management and Budget, I nominate Neera Tanden. I've known Neera for a long time. A brilliant policy mind with critical practical experience across government. She was raised by a single mom on food stamps, an immigrant from India who struggled, worked hard, and did everything she could for her daughter to live out her American dream. And Neera did just that. She understands the struggles that millions of Americans are facing. And she will be the first woman of color and first South Asian American to lead the OMB. She will be in charge of laying out my budget that will help us control the virus, deal with the economic crisis, and build back better. But above all, she believes what I believe , a budget should reflect our values. For Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, I nominate Wally Adeyemo. A skilled leader and thinker on issues ranging from macroeconomics to consumer protection, and from national security to international affairs. I worked with Wally during the Great Recession, and I saw him tackle one big job after another. Deputy National Security Advisor to President Obama. Deputy Director of the National Economic Council. Former Chief of Staff to Elizabeth Warren, where he helped create the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau. It's designed to protect consumers and working people from unfair, deceptive, and abusive financial practices. And now, Wally will be the first African American ever to hold this post, and the highest-ranking African American in Treasury Department history. An immigrant from Nigeria, a son of a nurse and an elementary school principal, Wally understands everything we do is for the people. To understand their struggles, and most of all, their dreams. For Chairperson of the Council of Economic Advisors, I nominate Cecilia 'CC' Rouse, one of the most distinguished economists in the country. An expert on labor economics, race, poverty, and education. Dean of Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs. Member of the Council of Economic Advisors to President Obama. Advisor to President Clinton at the National Economic Council. More than that, she's a proud daughter. Whose mom , a school psychologist , encouraged her to pursue economics. Whose dad , one of the country's first African American astrophysicists , who dared her to dream. If confirmed, CC will be just the fourth woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisors and the first African-American ever to hold the post. And as CEA Chair, she will serve as a member of my Cabinet. As a member of the Council of Economic Advisors, I appoint Jared Bernstein. A brilliant thinker with a quick wit , and a big heart he got from his mom , an educator , who raised him right. A social worker turned economist, Jared is one of my closest economic advisors. He served as my Chief Economist during my Vice Presidency. He was there in the foxhole during the Great Recession with the economy on the brink and our country on its back. I couldn't think of anyone else who I would want by my side to face the challenges ahead. Jared will be one of the leading voices of my Administration on economic policy. I can always count on him to deliver it straight from the shoulder as his hero FDR said. One thing I can assure you is working people will always have a voice with Jared on the Council. As a member of the Council of Economic Advisors, I appoint Heather Boushey. She is one of the foremost economists working to make sure we build an economy that works for all Americans. A daughter of a union family , it's no wonder she believes so deeply in the idea: leave no one out, leave no one behind. During the campaign, I relied on her counsel on addressing the structural inequalities in our economy. I'll do so again as President because it is a central issue of our time. To this team , thank you for accepting the call to serve. To your families , thank you for your sacrifice. We could not do this without you. And to the American people, this team will always be there for you and your families. Eleven years ago President Obama and I entered office during the Great Recession and implemented the Recovery Act that saved us from a Great Depression. We didn't see the map of America in terms of blue states and red states. We only saw the United States of America. We worked with everyone , for everyone. And we recovered and rebuilt , together , as one nation. Vice President-elect Harris and I will do it again with this outstanding team. They are ready on Day One. To the United States Senate , I hope these outstanding nominees will receive a prompt hearing, and that we will be able to work across the aisle in good faith and move forward as one country. Let us begin the work to heal, unite, and rebuild an economy for all Americans. They deserve and expect nothing less. Thank you. May God bless you. May God protect our troops. I'll now turn it over to the new team, starting with our next Secretary of the Treasury , Janet Yellen."}

{"SpeechID":"VSJB8122020185","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-12-08","SpeechTitle":"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by President-elect Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware","Type":"speech","RawText":"Good afternoon. Today, I am announcing our health care and COVID team at a critical time, as we near the end of one of the toughest years we've faced as a nation. More than 285,000 Americans are dead because of COVID-19 , and counting. Last week, COVID-19 was the number one cause of death in America. For Black, Latino, and Native Americans , who are nearly three times as likely to die from it , COVID-19 is a mass casualty event. For families and friends left behind, it's a gaping hole in your heart that will never fully heal. And as a country, we've been living with this pandemic for so long that we're at risk of becoming numb to its toll on us. We're resigned to feel there is nothing we can do. That we can't trust one another. That we must accept the death, the pain, and the sorrow. We are in the midst of this deadly pandemic that has infected almost 15 million Americans , one out of every 22 of our people , often with devastating consequences to their health. And at this very moment, what is the outgoing Administration asking the Supreme Court of the United States to do? To repeal in its entirety the Affordable Care Act. A law that's on the frontlines against the pandemic. That protects more than 100 million Americans who live with pre-existing conditions , which now includes lung scarring and heart damage from COVID-19. That provides coverage to more than 20 million Americans who get the care they need if they're showing symptoms of COVID-19. The law that fulfills our moral obligation that, here in America, health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the few. But I know that out of our collective pain, we will find our collective purpose , to control the pandemic, to save lives, and to heal as a nation. Today, I am pleased to announce the team that will do just that. It's a team of world-class experts at the top of their fields. Crisis-tested. Defined by a deep sense of duty, honor, and patriotism. They are ready on Day One to spare no effort and get the pandemic under control, so we can get back to work, back to our lives, and back to our loved ones. They will lead the COVID-19 response across our government to accelerate testing, fix our supply chain, and distribute the vaccine. They will work with my economic team , because controlling the pandemic, delivering better health care, and reviving the economy go hand in hand. They will work with my foreign policy and national security team , because we can only beat this virus if we beat it everywhere. And today I am announcing that , in consultation with Dr. Tony Fauci , we've developed the first three objectives and new initiatives that I am asking this team to complete during my first 100 days in office. My first 100 days won't end COVID-19. I cannot promise that. We did not get into this mess quickly, and it's going to take time to fix. But I am convinced that in 100 days we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better. First, my 100 day masking plan. It starts with my signing an order on Day One to require masks where I can , like federal buildings and interstate travel on planes, trains, and buses. I'll be working with governors and mayors to do the same in states and cities. We are going to require masks wherever possible, but this goes beyond government action. And so, as a new President, I'm going to speak directly to the American people. We need your help. Wear a mask for 100 days. It's the easiest thing you can do to reduce COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Help yourself, your family, your community. Whatever your politics or point of view , mask up for 100 days. 100 days to make a difference. It's not a political statement , it's a patriotic act. It won't be the end of our efforts. But it's a necessary and easy start. Second, this team will help get at least 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into the arms of Americans in 100 days. We will follow the guidance of scientists and get vaccines to those most at-risk. That includes health care personnel and people in long-term care; and, as soon as possible, that will include educators. This will be the most efficient mass vaccination plan in U.S. history. I credit everyone who has gotten us to this point, but developing the vaccine is one herculean task. Distributing it is another. And vaccines in a vial only work if they are injected into the arms of people, especially those most at risk. This will be one of the hardest and most costly operational challenges in our history. We're going to need Congress to fully fund vaccine distribution to all corners of our country. I am encouraged by the bipartisan efforts in Congress around a $900 billion economic relief package, which I've said is critical now, but this package is only a start for more action early next year. We must also focus significant resources on the direct public health response to COVID-19. Our preliminary review of the Trump Administration's vaccine distribution plan confirms media reports. Without urgent action this month by Congress to put sufficient resources into vaccine distribution and manufacturing , which the bipartisan group is working on , there is a real chance that, after an early round of vaccinations, the effort will slow and stall. Let me repeat: We need Congress to finish the bipartisan work underway now ormillions of Americans may wait months longer , months longer , than they otherwise would have to get their vaccinations. And then we will need additional action next year to fund the rest of our distribution efforts. We also need the Trump Administration to act now to purchase the doses it has negotiated with Pfizer and Moderna and to work swiftly to scale manufacturing for the U.S. population and the world. This can be fixed. If it does, my team will be able to get at least 100 million vaccinations done in my first 100 days. Third, it should be a national priority to get our kids back into school and keep them in school. If Congress provides the funding we need to protect students, educators, and staff, and if states and cities put strong public health measures in place that we all follow, then my team will work to see that the majority of our schools can be open by the end of my first 100 days. That's right, we will look to have most of the schools open in 100 days if Congress provides the funding we need. Masking. Vaccinations. Opening schools. These are three key goals for my first 100 days. But we will still have much to do in the year ahead. And sadly, much difficulty, too. We will be far, far from done. Yet, it is possible that after 100 days, we will be much further along in the fight against the pandemic. And I'm grateful for the members of my core COVID team, that I will now introduce, to lead the way. For Secretary of Health and Human Services, I nominate Xavier Becerra. He's currently Attorney General of California, leading the second largest Justice Department in America , only behind the United States Department of Justice. For nearly 25 years before that, he was a Congressman representing Los Angeles, one of America's largest and most diverse cities. Xavier spent his career fighting to expand access to health care, reduce racial health disparities, protect the Affordable Care Act, and take on powerful special interests who prey on and profit off people's health , from opioid manufacturers to Big Tobacco. During the pandemic, he's protected the safety of frontline healthcare workers, rooted out fraud from bad actors taking advantage of people, and stood up for homeowners trying to pay their mortgage during the devastating economic crisis. And as HHS Secretary, he will skillfully oversee the CDC and FDA, Medicare and Medicaid. No matter what happens in the Supreme Court, he will lead our efforts to build on the Affordable Care Act. He'll work to dramatically expand coverage and take bold steps to lower health care and prescription drug costs. Xavier is the key leader who will lead the key agency charged with protecting the health and wellness of the American people. He will also be the first Latino leading HHS, a son from a working-class immigrant family that came from Mexico. A true public servant who has dedicated his career in service to the people, and in service to this country that we all love. To serve as the Coordinator of the COVID-19 Response Team, I'm turning to a world-class manager and leader, Jeff Zients. I've known Jeff for a long time , from the first and last days of the Obama-Biden White House, and throughout the campaign, and now the transition. There's no one else you want to help manage some of the most consequential and complex priorities of a country. Director of the National Economic Council for President Obama. Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget. He was there during the Great Recession, as we went from crisis to recovery to resurgence over eight years. He was there to lead the team and help implement the Affordable Care Act , to get HealthCare.gov up and working at a critical moment. That was a monumental feat that required vision, patience, and fortitude and expertise. Well-respected across the aisle, and around the country from business and labor leaders to entrepreneurs and educators. Chairman of the Board of Children's National Medical Center, one of the world's top children's hospitals. Jeff knows how to build and lead a team. How to identify and solve problems. And how to fully mobilize the federal government on behalf of the health, safety, and prosperity of the American people. For Surgeon General of the United States, I nominate Dr. Vivek Murthy. A renowned physician and research scientist. A trusted national leader on health care, and for me, a trusted advisor during this campaign and transition. This will be his second time serving as America's Doctor, having served in this role under President Obama. During his tenure, he took on some of the most pressing public health issues we face , from the opioid crisis to threats to America's mental health. I've asked Dr. Murthy to serve again as Surgeon General , but with expanded responsibilities. He will be a key public voice on our COVID response, to restore public trust and faith in science and medicine. But he will also be a key advisor to me and help lead an all-government approach to broader public health issues , mental health, addiction and substance use disorders, social and environmental determinants of health, and so much more. Above all, he will help restore faith in this country as a place of possibilities. A son of Indian immigrants, who raised their children to always believe in the promise of America. Dr. Murthy will be one of my most trusted public health and medical advisors , and I'm grateful for his continued public service. For Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I appoint Dr. Rochelle Walensky. She is the Chief of Infectious Diseases at one of the country's preeminent hospitals, Massachusetts General in Boston. A distinguished professor at Harvard Medical School. A world-class physician. One of the nation's foremost experts on the testing, treatment, and eradication of viruses. She has served on the front lines of the COVID crisis. She has conducted groundbreaking research on vaccine delivery, including how to reach underserved communities that are too often hit first and the hardest. Dr. Walensky's work was instrumental in helping the world mitigate one public health crisis , HIV\/AIDS. It inspired her as a young doctor to pursue her pioneering research in virus containment. Now, she will bring her experience to bear against COVID-19. She is uniquely qualified to restore morale and public trust. She will marshal our finest scientists and public health experts at the CDC to turn the tide on the urgent crisis facing us today. Because of the pandemic's disproportionate impact on communities of color, I concluded we need a COVID-19 Equity Task Force. To chair it, I appoint Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith. One of the country's foremost experts on health care disparities. Associate Professor of Medicine, Public Health, and Management at the Yale School of Medicine. Founding director of Yale's Equity Research and Innovation Center. And co-chair of my COVID-19 Transition Advisory Board. Dr. Nunez-Smith will lead our efforts to provide care to the communities most in need and most affected by the pandemic and most often overlooked. She will ensure that fairness and equity are at the center of every part of our response. This is a central front in our fight against the pandemic, and I am grateful Dr. Nunez-Smith will lead this charge. And finally, as both head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and my chief medical advisor on COVID-19 , I am pleased that Dr. Tony Fauci will be a member of my core COVID team. By now, he needs no introduction. But he will have my gratitude when I'm president, the seventh president he will have served. We've known each other a long time. I've seen him take on HIV\/AIDS, H1N1, Ebola, Zika, COVID-19, and every infectious disease in between, over his nearly forty years of service to our country. Trusted. A truth teller. A patriot. Like every good doctor, he will tell me what I need to know, not what I want to know. This is my core COVID and health care team. Before January 20, we will be adding more leaders to oversee vaccine distribution, supply chain, testing, and other key functions. To each of you on this team, you have my gratitude for answering the call to serve. And to your families, thank you. We could not do this without them, or without you. And to the American people, I know we've all had a lot of sleepless nights this year. So many of you staring at the ceiling late at night, worrying if you're going to be okay. All I can tell you is the truth. We're in a dark winter. Things may well get worse before they get better. A vaccine may soon be available. But we need to level with each other. It will take longer than we would like to distribute it to all corners of our country. We will need to persuade enough Americans to take it. It's daunting, but I promise you that we will make progress starting on Day One. But we didn't get into this mess quickly, and it'll take time to fix. That's the truth, and telling you the truth is what this team, Vice President-elect Harris, and I will always do. This is one of the toughest challenges America has ever faced. But I know that we will overcome , and heal , together as one nation. To all of the front-line health professionals and first responders, the grocery store workers and delivery truck drivers, the educators, parents, and our children. Thank you. Thank you for everything you have done to get us through this crisis thus far. We will never give up on you. And we will never give up on our country. We can do this, together. To all those we have lost in this pandemic, and all those sick and suffering, our hearts go out to you. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Thank you. I'll now turn it over to the team, starting with our next Secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1489690\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Executive Branch Health and Health Care","Source":null,"Location":"Wilmington, DE","Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware-4\/","CleanText":"Good afternoon. Today, I am announcing our health care and COVID team at a critical time, as we near the end of one of the toughest years we've faced as a nation. More than 285,000 Americans are dead because of COVID-19 , and counting. Last week, COVID-19 was the number one cause of death in America. For Black, Latino, and Native Americans , who are nearly three times as likely to die from it , COVID-19 is a mass casualty event. For families and friends left behind, it's a gaping hole in your heart that will never fully heal. And as a country, we've been living with this pandemic for so long that we're at risk of becoming numb to its toll on us. We're resigned to feel there is nothing we can do. That we can't trust one another. That we must accept the death, the pain, and the sorrow. We are in the midst of this deadly pandemic that has infected almost 15 million Americans , one out of every 22 of our people , often with devastating consequences to their health. And at this very moment, what is the outgoing Administration asking the Supreme Court of the United States to do? To repeal in its entirety the Affordable Care Act. A law that's on the frontlines against the pandemic. That protects more than 100 million Americans who live with pre-existing conditions , which now includes lung scarring and heart damage from COVID-19. That provides coverage to more than 20 million Americans who get the care they need if they're showing symptoms of COVID-19. The law that fulfills our moral obligation that, here in America, health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the few. But I know that out of our collective pain, we will find our collective purpose , to control the pandemic, to save lives, and to heal as a nation. Today, I am pleased to announce the team that will do just that. It's a team of world-class experts at the top of their fields. Crisis-tested. Defined by a deep sense of duty, honor, and patriotism. They are ready on Day One to spare no effort and get the pandemic under control, so we can get back to work, back to our lives, and back to our loved ones. They will lead the COVID-19 response across our government to accelerate testing, fix our supply chain, and distribute the vaccine. They will work with my economic team , because controlling the pandemic, delivering better health care, and reviving the economy go hand in hand. They will work with my foreign policy and national security team , because we can only beat this virus if we beat it everywhere. And today I am announcing that , in consultation with Dr. Tony Fauci , we've developed the first three objectives and new initiatives that I am asking this team to complete during my first 100 days in office. My first 100 days won't end COVID-19. I cannot promise that. We did not get into this mess quickly, and it's going to take time to fix. But I am convinced that in 100 days we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better. First, my 100 day masking plan. It starts with my signing an order on Day One to require masks where I can , like federal buildings and interstate travel on planes, trains, and buses. I'll be working with governors and mayors to do the same in states and cities. We are going to require masks wherever possible, but this goes beyond government action. And so, as a new President, I'm going to speak directly to the American people. We need your help. Wear a mask for 100 days. It's the easiest thing you can do to reduce COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Help yourself, your family, your community. Whatever your politics or point of view , mask up for 100 days. 100 days to make a difference. It's not a political statement , it's a patriotic act. It won't be the end of our efforts. But it's a necessary and easy start. Second, this team will help get at least 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into the arms of Americans in 100 days. We will follow the guidance of scientists and get vaccines to those most at-risk. That includes health care personnel and people in long-term care; and, as soon as possible, that will include educators. This will be the most efficient mass vaccination plan in U.S. history. I credit everyone who has gotten us to this point, but developing the vaccine is one herculean task. Distributing it is another. And vaccines in a vial only work if they are injected into the arms of people, especially those most at risk. This will be one of the hardest and most costly operational challenges in our history. We're going to need Congress to fully fund vaccine distribution to all corners of our country. I am encouraged by the bipartisan efforts in Congress around a $900 billion economic relief package, which I've said is critical now, but this package is only a start for more action early next year. We must also focus significant resources on the direct public health response to COVID-19. Our preliminary review of the Trump Administration's vaccine distribution plan confirms media reports. Without urgent action this month by Congress to put sufficient resources into vaccine distribution and manufacturing , which the bipartisan group is working on , there is a real chance that, after an early round of vaccinations, the effort will slow and stall. Let me repeat: We need Congress to finish the bipartisan work underway now ormillions of Americans may wait months longer , months longer , than they otherwise would have to get their vaccinations. And then we will need additional action next year to fund the rest of our distribution efforts. We also need the Trump Administration to act now to purchase the doses it has negotiated with Pfizer and Moderna and to work swiftly to scale manufacturing for the U.S. population and the world. This can be fixed. If it does, my team will be able to get at least 100 million vaccinations done in my first 100 days. Third, it should be a national priority to get our kids back into school and keep them in school. If Congress provides the funding we need to protect students, educators, and staff, and if states and cities put strong public health measures in place that we all follow, then my team will work to see that the majority of our schools can be open by the end of my first 100 days. That's right, we will look to have most of the schools open in 100 days if Congress provides the funding we need. Masking. Vaccinations. Opening schools.

Today, it is my great honor to add to my national security team a leader of extraordinary character, courage, experience, and accomplishment. Someone with whom I have worked closely for many years, and who I have seen perform to the highest standards under intense pressure. Someone who I hold in the highest personal regard as a man of great decency and dignity. In my judgment, there is no question that he is the right person for the job of leading the Department of Defense at this moment in our nation's history. He's led a major coalition of allies and partners to fight terrorism. Overseen some of the most complex logistical efforts ever undertaken by the United States military. Helped end a war and bring tens of thousands of troops home safely. He is loved by the men and women of America's armed forces. Feared by our adversaries. Known and respected by our allies. He shares my deeply held belief in the value of America's alliances. And he is just as committed as I am to rebuilding and modernizing those alliances , from the Asia Pacific to Europe and around the world. Through sheer determination and extraordinary skill, he has been breaking down barriers and blazing a trail forward in this nation for more than forty years. And he will do so again. And so today, I am honored to nominate General Lloyd Austin as the 28th Secretary of Defense. I want to thank you, General Austin, for once more stepping forward to serve our nation. And I want to thank your family for once more sharing you with our country. Lloyd, I know how proud they all are of you , all four of your older sisters and your brother. And your incredible wife Charlene. She and Jill are both passionate about supporting military spouses and families, and I know they will be powerful advocates for that community together, in the White House and at the Defense Department. I got to know General Austin during my early days as Vice President. President Obama had charged me with overseeing the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom and ensuring the orderly withdrawal of our forces and equipment from Iraq. General Austin was with me on the ground. Not just for meetings with our troops or for military strategy sessions. He was there when I met with Iraq's political leaders, when I met with the leaders of our coalition partners. And, he was there during one particularly memorable incident when we were at a meeting at the Ambassador's residence in the Green Zone and insurgents launched a rocket at the house. Of course, for General Austin, it was just another day at the office, and we all just kept going about our meeting. Cool under fire. Inspiring the same in all those around him. That's Lloyd Austin. He was the person President Obama and I entrusted with the incredible task of bringing home American forces and redeploying our military equipment safely out of Iraq. It was the largest logistics operation undertaken by the Army in 60 years. And getting it done required much more than military know-how. General Austin was a diplomat. He built relationships with our Iraqi counterparts and with our coalition partners. He was a statesman, representing our country with skill at tables with foreign leaders, both military and civilians. And always, above all, he looked out for his people. That's why he was known as \"the soldier's leader.\" In his time in the United States Army, Lloyd Austin met every challenge with extraordinary skill and profound personal decency. He is the definition of duty, honor, country. And at every step, he challenged the institution that he loves to grow more inclusive and more diverse. He was the 200th person ever to attain the rank of an Army 4-star General, but only the sixth African American. He was the first African American general officer to lead an Army Corps in combat. The first African American to command an entire theater of war. And, if confirmed, he will be the first African American to helm the Defense Department , another milestone in his barrier-breaking career of service. Lloyd Austin retired from military service more than four years ago. But the law states that an officer must have left the service seven years before becoming Secretary of Defense. There are good reasons for this law that I fully understand and respect, and I would not be asking for an exception here if I did not believe this moment in our history didn't call for it , and if I didn't have the faith I do in Lloyd Austinto ask for it. I believe in the importance of civilian control of our military , so does Secretary-designate Austin. He will be bolstered by strong and empowered civilian senior officials working to shape DoD's policies and ensure that our defense policies are accountable to the American people. The civil-military dynamic has been under great stress these past four years, and I know that Secretary-designate Austin will work tirelessly to get it back on track. I have personally worked with this man. I have seen him lead America's fighting forces on the field of battle. I have also watched him faithfully carry out the orders of the civilian leadership of this nation. There is no doubt in my mind whether this nominee will honor, respect, and on a day-to-day breathe life into the preeminent principle of civilian leadership over military matters in our nation. I know this man. I know his respect for our Constitution. And I know his respect for our system of government. So, just as they did for Secretary Jim Mattis, I ask that Congress grant a waiver to Secretary-designate Austin. His many strengths and his intimate knowledge of the Department of Defense and of our government are uniquely suited to the challenges and crises we face. He is the person we need in this moment. And, given the urgent threats and challenges our nation faces, he should be confirmed swiftly. We need his expertise in large-scale logistics operations to help support the swift and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. We need his experience building and managing relationships and engaging in diplomacy with our partners to help rebuild America's alliances and strengthen our shared security. We need his firsthand knowledge of the immeasurable cost of war and the burden it places on our service members and their families to help bring to an end forever warsand ensure that the use of force is our tool of last resort to protect our national security, not our first. We need his deep understanding of the Pentagon to help reform the Department of Defense. We need his personal experience helping inform our efforts to ensure that our armed forces reflect the full strength and diversity of our nation , that Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, women, and LGBTQ service members are treated with dignity and respect. At a time when more than 40 percent of our active duty forces are people of color, it's past time the Department had leadership that reflects that diversity. And we need his in-depth understanding of what it takes to deter threats wherever they arise and to defend the American people, our vital interests, and our allies from harm , just as he did when he designed and led the strategy, together with dozens of partner nations, that ultimately crushed the ISIS threat. The threats we face today are not the same as those we faced ten or even five years ago. We must prepare to meet the challenges of the future, not keep fighting the wars of the past. We must build a foreign policy that leads with diplomacy and revitalizes our alliances, putting American leadership back at the table and rallying the world to meet global threats to our security , from pandemics to climate change, and from nuclear proliferation to the refugee crisis. As part of our diverse national-security leadership team, Lloyd Austin knows how to do this work. Before I turn the podium over to Secretary-designate Austin, I want to end on a note of personal privilege. As a leader, General Austin has always followed the advice given to him by his first platoon sergeant: If you focus on your people, take care of them, get out in front and lead them , they will refuse to let you fail. It's why he has inspired so many young people who work for him to give their very best, and to live up to his example of leadership , including, for a time, a lawyer serving a year in Iraq with his Delaware Army National Guard unit. My son, Beau Biden. I know how proud Beau was to serve on your staff, General Austin. And I know that, under your leadership, the Department of Defense will advance the security of the American people in ways that always honor our highest values and ideals. So, thank you again, and may God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1490371\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Executive Branch","Source":null,"Location":"Wilmington, DE","Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware-5\/","CleanText":"Good afternoon.

She and Jill are both passionate about supporting military spouses and families, and I know they will be powerful advocates for that community together, in the White House and at the Defense Department. I got to know General Austin during my early days as Vice President. President Obama had charged me with overseeing the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom and ensuring the orderly withdrawal of our forces and equipment from Iraq. General Austin was with me on the ground. Not just for meetings with our troops or for military strategy sessions. He was there when I met with Iraq's political leaders, when I met with the leaders of our coalition partners. And, he was there during one particularly memorable incident when we were at a meeting at the Ambassador's residence in the Green Zone and insurgents launched a rocket at the house. Of course, for General Austin, it was just another day at the office, and we all just kept going about our meeting. Cool under fire. Inspiring the same in all those around him. That's Lloyd Austin. He was the person President Obama and I entrusted with the incredible task of bringing home American forces and redeploying our military equipment safely out of Iraq. It was the largest logistics operation undertaken by the Army in 60 years. And getting it done required much more than military know-how. General Austin was a diplomat. He built relationships with our Iraqi counterparts and with our coalition partners. He was a statesman, representing our country with skill at tables with foreign leaders, both military and civilians. And always, above all, he looked out for his people. That's why he was known as 'the soldier's leader.' In his time in the United States Army, Lloyd Austin met every challenge with extraordinary skill and profound personal decency. He is the definition of duty, honor, country. And at every step, he challenged the institution that he loves to grow more inclusive and more diverse. He was the 200th person ever to attain the rank of an Army 4-star General, but only the sixth African American. He was the first African American general officer to lead an Army Corps in combat. The first African American to command an entire theater of war. And, if confirmed, he will be the first African American to helm the Defense Department , another milestone in his barrier-breaking career of service. Lloyd Austin retired from military service more than four years ago. But the law states that an officer must have left the service seven years before becoming Secretary of Defense. There are good reasons for this law that I fully understand and respect, and I would not be asking for an exception here if I did not believe this moment in our history didn't call for it , and if I didn't have the faith I do in Lloyd Austinto ask for it. I believe in the importance of civilian control of our military , so does Secretary-designate Austin. He will be bolstered by strong and empowered civilian senior officials working to shape DoD's policies and ensure that our defense policies are accountable to the American people. The civil-military dynamic has been under great stress these past four years, and I know that Secretary-designate Austin will work tirelessly to get it back on track. I have personally worked with this man. I have seen him lead America's fighting forces on the field of battle. I have also watched him faithfully carry out the orders of the civilian leadership of this nation. There is no doubt in my mind whether this nominee will honor, respect, and on a day-to-day breathe life into the preeminent principle of civilian leadership over military matters in our nation. I know this man. I know his respect for our Constitution. And I know his respect for our system of government. So, just as they did for Secretary Jim Mattis, I ask that Congress grant a waiver to Secretary-designate Austin. His many strengths and his intimate knowledge of the Department of Defense and of our government are uniquely suited to the challenges and crises we face. He is the person we need in this moment. And, given the urgent threats and challenges our nation faces, he should be confirmed swiftly. We need his expertise in large-scale logistics operations to help support the swift and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. We need his experience building and managing relationships and engaging in diplomacy with our partners to help rebuild America's alliances and strengthen our shared security. We need his firsthand knowledge of the immeasurable cost of war and the burden it places on our service members and their families to help bring to an end forever warsand ensure that the use of force is our tool of last resort to protect our national security, not our first. We need his deep understanding of the Pentagon to help reform the Department of Defense. We need his personal experience helping inform our efforts to ensure that our armed forces reflect the full strength and diversity of our nation , that Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, women, and LGBTQ service members are treated with dignity and respect. At a time when more than 40 percent of our active duty forces are people of color, it's past time the Department had leadership that reflects that diversity. And we need his in-depth understanding of what it takes to deter threats wherever they arise and to defend the American people, our vital interests, and our allies from harm , just as he did when he designed and led the strategy, together with dozens of partner nations, that ultimately crushed the ISIS threat. The threats we face today are not the same as those we faced ten or even five years ago. We must prepare to meet the challenges of the future, not keep fighting the wars of the past. We must build a foreign policy that leads with diplomacy and revitalizes our alliances, putting American leadership back at the table and rallying the world to meet global threats to our security , from pandemics to climate change, and from nuclear proliferation to the refugee crisis. As part of our diverse national-security leadership team, Lloyd Austin knows how to do this work. Before I turn the podium over to Secretary-designate Austin, I want to end on a note of personal privilege. As a leader, General Austin has always followed the advice given to him by his first platoon sergeant: If you focus on your people, take care of them, get out in front and lead them , they will refuse to let you fail. It's why he has inspired so many young people who work for him to give their very best, and to live up to his example of leadership , including, for a time, a lawyer serving a year in Iraq with his Delaware Army National Guard unit. My son, Beau Biden. I know how proud Beau was to serve on your staff, General Austin. And I know that, under your leadership, the Department of Defense will advance the security of the American people in ways that always honor our highest values and ideals. So, thank you again, and may God protect our troops."}

Before I make my announcements for today, I want to say a few words about the COVID-19 crisis. This week marked yet another tragic milestone in our fight against COVID-19. More than 3,000 deaths in one single day , the highest single death count during the pandemic. That's more deaths in a single day than we saw on either 9\/11 or Pearl Harbor. And the current director of the CDC said yesterday that we can expect a similar number of deaths or more every single day for the next 60 to 90 days. We're in the teeth of this crisis right now. And this nation needs presidential leadership , right now. Presidential leadership that is willing to model the steps we all should be taking in our own lives. We can't wish it away. We have to face it. And we will take it on. Using every power available to me as president, we will have a national coordinated strategy. And we will beat this virus. And as tough as things are now, I firmly believe better days are ahead.We got some good news yesterday. The FDA Advisory Committee recommended emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. We are grateful for the scientists and researchers who developed the vaccine. We're just as grateful to the scientists and public experts who evaluated its safety and efficacy, free from political influence. Scientific integrity led us to this point. But we know the immense challenges and hard work ahead. Earlier this week, I announced our COVID Response Team that will scale up the manufacturing, distribution, and injection of the vaccine. And we set a bold , but doable , challenge for my first 100 days. 100 million shots in 100 days. Asking the American people to wear masks for 100 days. And if we get the necessary funding from Congress, we can get most of our schools open in 100 days. The first 100 days won't end COVID-19, but meeting these goals can slow the spread, save lives, and get us back to our lives with our loved ones. And so will getting the right people confirmed and in place to manage this robust, aggressive plan to contain the virus, help us build back better than ever, and make sure everyone is included. Today, I am pleased to add members to my team that will get the job done. In addition to the pandemic's grim milestone, the economic crisis has left millions of Americans out of work, without a paycheck, and without health insurance. Unable to put enough food on the table. Unsure whether they can pay rent or mortgage as the new year begins. It's affecting everyone from farmers to students, seniors to veterans , in red states and blue states, in small towns and big cities. That's why the Congress needs to act , and act now on the Covid package. It must get done before they go home. Millions and millions of Americans simply can't wait any longer. We shouldn't , and we can't , get bogged down on issues that don't help people. State and local governments need the help. Not only that, as I've said for months now, we need to protect essential personnel , like cops and firefighters , and make sure everything is in place to effectively distribute the vaccine. This relief package won't be the total answer. But it's an important first step. There's so much we have to do. These crises have ripped the blinders off the systemic racism in America. Black, Latino, and Native Americans are nearly three times more likely to die from COVID-19. The Black and Latino unemployment gap remains too large. And communities of color are left to ask whether they will ever be able to break the cycle where in good times they lag, in bad times they are hit first and the hardest, and in recovery they take the longest to bounce back. Vice President-elect Harris and I knew we'd have our work cut out for us when we got elected. But we also knew we could build a team that would meet this unique and challenging moment. Some are familiar faces. Some are in new roles. All are facing new circumstances and challenges. That's a good thing. They bring deep experience and bold new thinking. Above all, they know how government should and can work for all Americans. For Secretary of Agriculture, I nominate Tom Vilsack. An outstanding two-term Governor of Iowa, and the best Secretary of Agriculture I believe our country has ever had. He was there when the Great Recession was pummeling rural America. Over eight years, he oversaw record-breaking investments to bring us back. He implemented the Recovery Act to help rural communities recover and rebuild. Tom helped expand markets around the world for American farmers. He improved our food safety standards and helped millions of children and familiesreceive healthy meals. I asked him to serve again in this role because he knows USDA inside and out. We need that experience now. One-in-six Americans , and a quarter of children in America , are facing hunger. The opioid crisis is a rural America crisis, as is the climate crisis with droughts and floods wiping out crops and small towns. Farmers and small businesses in small towns and rural communities , white, Black, Latino , are reeling from the pandemic and economic downturn. Tom knows the full range of resources available in this department to get immediate relief to those most in need and address the crises facing rural America. He knows how to build back better for all Americans. He helped develop my rural plan for America in the campaign, and he will now carry it out. That includes making American agriculture the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions and create new sources of income for farmers in the process, by paying farmers to put their land in conservation and plant cover crops that use the soil to capture carbon. And he will ensure that USDA promotes true racial equity and inclusion. He recognizes the history of discrimination and will root it out wherever it exists. I've known Tom a long time. He will get it done. For Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, I nominate Congresswoman Marcia Fudge. A former Mayor who understands how to manage challenges and forge solutions at the local level. For twelve years in Congress, she's represented the great city of Cleveland. Though I think her most significant political feat was winning the presidency of the Deltas. She's devoted her entire career to fighting for working people on issues , from affordable housing to urban revitalization. During the Great Recession, her district was hit hard by the housing crisis. She's spent the past decade working to improve blighted neighborhoods and create safer, more affordable communities. She also understands where you live impacts your health, access to education, jobs, and economic opportunity. She'll bring that same vision as HUD Secretary, using every lever at her disposal to help the millions of Americans facing eviction , trying to pay their mortgage and find their way through this crisis. She will lead our charge to make housing more affordable and accessible. She'll work to increase home ownership as a means toward wealth generation for communities of color. And she will help us build back better by working across the ideological spectrum to fulfill the promise of HUD's mission: \"to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.\" Marcia will be the first woman to lead HUD in more than 40 years , and just the second Black woman ever. I am honored to have her serve in the Biden-Harris Administration at this critical moment in our nation's history. For Secretary of Veterans Affairs, I nominate Denis McDonough. Former White House Chief of Staff. Former Deputy National Security Advisor. Deep experience on Capitol Hill. He shares my belief that we have many obligations as a nation, but we have only one, truly sacred obligation: To prepare and equip our troops that we send in harm's way and then to care for them , and their families , when they return. He regularly traveled to Afghanistan and Iraq to meet directly with our service members to see what they were going through and understand the strains they and their families were going through. He'd visit them at Walter Reed to see first-hand the visible and invisible wounds they brought home. He knows the cost of war on veterans and their families , from the toll on their physical and mental health to their access to good-paying jobs. He is a fierce advocate, a relentless workhorse, and a world-class manager with an innate understanding for how government can and must work for them. He worked closely with then-VA Secretary Bob McDonald and Congress to increase VA funding and to ensure veterans can get the benefits they earned and deserve. That included implementing Veterans Choice , a bill led by my friend Bernie Sanders and our late friend, the American hero John McCain and signed into law by President Obama in 2014 , to help veterans access the quality health care they need when they need it. In this new role, I've given Denis a clear mission: fight like hell for our veterans and their families. And anyone who has worked with Denis will tell you, he will move Heaven and Earth to fix any problem and get the job done. He will also work closely with our Secretary of Defense-designate Lloyd Austin, the entire Cabinet, and Jill as First Lady to pull every lever to help us build back the VA better than ever. And with Denis, it's a family endeavor. His wife Kari leads a nonprofit that helps connect veterans and military families with local communities so they can help each other out , and build a stronger country together. To all the veterans and military families: nominating a VA Secretary is one of the most important decisions I believe a president can make. Denis will always be there for you. Always. For United States Trade Representative, I nominate Katherine Tai. A tested trade expert. A dedicated public servant who knows government and who has spent her career leveling the playing field for American workers and families. She currently serves as the chief lawyer on trade for the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. She's earned praise from lawmakers of both parties and from labor and business. During the Obama-Biden Administration, she was the chief trade enforcer against unfair trade practices by China, which will be a key priority for the Biden-Harris Administration. She understands that we need to be more strategic in how we trade , in a way that makes us all stronger and leaves no one behind. She will work closely with my economic, national security, and foreign policy teams. Trade will be a critical pillar of our ability to build back better and carry out our Foreign Policy for the Middle Class. She brings a sophisticated understanding of the threats of climate change to trade and will address the climate crisis with urgency. She also embodies a powerful immigrant story of America. Her parents were born in China, moved to Taiwan, and then came to the United States where Katherine was born. Her parents became government scientists at Walter Reed and the NIH, inspiring their daughter to pursue a career in public service. Katherine says she's the first American-born member of her family , and a second-generation U.S. government servant. If confirmed, she would be the first Asian American and first woman of color to serve in this position. And our nation, our economy, our workers, our businesses will be fortunate to have her serve in this role. And for Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, I appoint Susan Rice. Former United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Former National Security Advisor to President Obama. A former cabinet member, a team player, a policy heavyweight and tough negotiator, and a trusted and tested public servant, who I have known and admired for a long time. She will lead and coordinate my critical domestic policy agenda. Susan will elevate and turbo-charge a revitalized Domestic Policy Council to help us build back better on every issue across the board. She will work closely with my director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese. She will work closely with my National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, at the National Security Council. Together, they will align domestic policy, economic policy, and national security unlike ever before. It's a big job and a critical one. That's why I've asked Susan to serve again. She's been there. She knows what it takes , like she did in helping mobilize the entire federal government to end the Ebola crisis. And her voice is particularly needed at this critical moment. A granddaughter of immigrants and a descendent of enslaved people, Susan will be an effective, tireless champion for all Americans. I am thrilled she will be back at my side in the White House. To each of you on this team, you have my gratitude for answering the call to serve. To your families, thank you. We could not do this without you. To the career civil servants at these agencies, we look forward to working with you. It's time to re-dedicate ourselves to the missions our government agencieswere entrusted with. And to the American people, help is on the way. We will not let you down. May God bless you. May God protect our troops. I'll now turn it over to the team, starting with the next Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1490696\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Executive Branch Health and Health Care","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware-6\/","CleanText":"Good afternoon.

He shares my belief that we have many obligations as a nation, but we have only one, truly sacred obligation: To prepare and equip our troops that we send in harm's way and then to care for them , and their families , when they return. He regularly traveled to Afghanistan and Iraq to meet directly with our service members to see what they were going through and understand the strains they and their families were going through. He'd visit them at Walter Reed to see first-hand the visible and invisible wounds they brought home. He knows the cost of war on veterans and their families , from the toll on their physical and mental health to their access to good-paying jobs. He is a fierce advocate, a relentless workhorse, and a world-class manager with an innate understanding for how government can and must work for them. He worked closely with then-VA Secretary Bob McDonald and Congress to increase VA funding and to ensure veterans can get the benefits they earned and deserve. That included implementing Veterans Choice , a bill led by my friend Bernie Sanders and our late friend, the American hero John McCain and signed into law by President Obama in 2014 , to help veterans access the quality health care they need when they need it. In this new role, I've given Denis a clear mission: fight like hell for our veterans and their families. And anyone who has worked with Denis will tell you, he will move Heaven and Earth to fix any problem and get the job done. He will also work closely with our Secretary of Defense-designate Lloyd Austin, the entire Cabinet, and Jill as First Lady to pull every lever to help us build back the VA better than ever. And with Denis, it's a family endeavor. His wife Kari leads a nonprofit that helps connect veterans and military families with local communities so they can help each other out , and build a stronger country together. To all the veterans and military families: nominating a VA Secretary is one of the most important decisions I believe a president can make. Denis will always be there for you. Always. For United States Trade Representative, I nominate Katherine Tai. A tested trade expert. A dedicated public servant who knows government and who has spent her career leveling the playing field for American workers and families. She currently serves as the chief lawyer on trade for the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. She's earned praise from lawmakers of both parties and from labor and business. During the Obama-Biden Administration, she was the chief trade enforcer against unfair trade practices by China, which will be a key priority for the Biden-Harris Administration. She understands that we need to be more strategic in how we trade , in a way that makes us all stronger and leaves no one behind. She will work closely with my economic, national security, and foreign policy teams. Trade will be a critical pillar of our ability to build back better and carry out our Foreign Policy for the Middle Class. She brings a sophisticated understanding of the threats of climate change to trade and will address the climate crisis with urgency. She also embodies a powerful immigrant story of America. Her parents were born in China, moved to Taiwan, and then came to the United States where Katherine was born. Her parents became government scientists at Walter Reed and the NIH, inspiring their daughter to pursue a career in public service. Katherine says she's the first American-born member of her family , and a second-generation U.S. government servant. If confirmed, she would be the first Asian American and first woman of color to serve in this position. And our nation, our economy, our workers, our businesses will be fortunate to have her serve in this role. And for Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, I appoint Susan Rice. Former United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Former National Security Advisor to President Obama. A former cabinet member, a team player, a policy heavyweight and tough negotiator, and a trusted and tested public servant, who I have known and admired for a long time. She will lead and coordinate my critical domestic policy agenda. Susan will elevate and turbo-charge a revitalized Domestic Policy Council to help us build back better on every issue across the board. She will work closely with my director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese. She will work closely with my National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, at the National Security Council. Together, they will align domestic policy, economic policy, and national security unlike ever before. It's a big job and a critical one. That's why I've asked Susan to serve again. She's been there. She knows what it takes , like she did in helping mobilize the entire federal government to end the Ebola crisis. And her voice is particularly needed at this critical moment. A granddaughter of immigrants and a descendent of enslaved people, Susan will be an effective, tireless champion for all Americans. I am thrilled she will be back at my side in the White House. To each of you on this team, you have my gratitude for answering the call to serve. To your families, thank you. We could not do this without you. To the career civil servants at these agencies, we look forward to working with you. It's time to re-dedicate ourselves to the missions our government agencieswere entrusted with. And to the American people, help is on the way. We will not let you down. May God bless you. May God protect our troops. I'll now turn it over to the team, starting with the next Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack."}

{"SpeechID":"VSJB14122020182","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-12-14","SpeechTitle":"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by President-elect Joe Biden on the Electoral College Vote Certification in Wilmi ...","Type":"speech","RawText":"Good evening, my fellow Americans. Over the past few weeks, officials in each state, commonwealth, and district, without regard to party or political preference have certified their winning candidate. Today, the members of the Electoral College representing the certified winner, cast their votes for President and Vice President of the United States in an act just as old as our nation itself. And once again in America, the rule of law, our Constitution, and the will of the people have prevailed. Our democracy , pushed, tested, threatened , proved to be resilient, true, and strong. The Electoral College votes which occurred today reflect the fact that even in the face of a public health crisis unlike anything we have experienced in our lifetimes, the people voted. They voted in record numbers. More Americans voted this year than have ever voted in the history of the United States of America. Over 155 million Americans were determined to have their voices heard and their votes counted. At the start of the pandemic crisis, many were wondering how many Americans would vote at all. But those fears proved to be unfounded. We saw something very few predicted or even thought possible , the biggest voter turnout ever in the history of the United States of America. Numbers so big that this election now ranks as the clearest demonstration of the true will of the American people , one of the most amazing demonstrations of civic duty we've ever seen in our country. It should be celebrated, not attacked. More than 81 million of those votes were cast for me and Vice President-elect Harris. This too is a record number. More votes than any ticket has received in the history of America. It represented a winning margin of more than 7 million votes over the number of votes cast for President Trump and Vice President Pence. Altogether, Vice President-elect Harris and I earned 306 electoral votes , well exceeding the 270 electoral votes needed to secure victory. 306 electoral votes is the same number of electoral votes DonaldTrump and MikePence received in 2016. At that time, President Trump called his Electoral College tally a landslide. By his own standards, these numbers represented a clear victory then. And I respectfully suggest they do so now. If anyone didn't know it before, they know it now. What beats deep in the hearts of the American people is this: Democracy. The right to be heard. To have your vote counted. To choose the leaders of this nation. To govern ourselves. In America, politicians don't take power , the people grant power to them. The flame of democracy was lit in this nation a long time ago. And we now know that nothing, not even a pandemic or an abuse of power, can extinguish that flame. And as the people kept it aflame, so, too did courageous state and local officials and election workers. American democracy works because Americans make it work at the local level. One of the extraordinary things we saw this year was these everyday Americans , our friends and neighbors, often volunteers, Democrats and Republicans and Independents , demonstrating absolute courage. They showed a deep and unwavering faith in and a commitment to the law. They did their duty in the face of a pandemic. And then they could not and would not give credence to what they knew was not true. They knew the elections they oversaw were honest and free and fair. They saw it with their own eyes. And they wouldn't be bullied into saying anything different. It was truly remarkable because so many of these patriotic Americans were subjected to so much: enormous political pressure, verbal abuse, and even threats of physical violence. While we all wish that our fellow Americans in these positions will always show such courage and commitment to free and fair elections, I hope we never again see anyone subjected to the kind of threats and abuse we saw in this election. It is unconscionable. We owe these public servants a debt of gratitude. They didn't seek the spotlight, and our democracy survived because of them. Which is proof once more that it's the everyday American , infused with honor and character and decency , that is the heart of this nation. And in this election, their integrity was matched by the strength, independence, and the integrity of our judicial system. In America, when questions are raised about the legitimacy of any election, those questions are resolved through a legal process. And that is precisely what happened here. The Trump campaign brought dozens and dozens and dozens of legal challenges to test the results. They were heard. And they were found to be without merit. Time and again, President Trump's lawyers presented their arguments to state officials, state legislatures, state and federal courts, and ultimately to the United States Supreme Court, twice. They were heard by more than 80 judges across the country. And in every case, no cause or evidence was found to reverse or question or dispute the results. A few states went to recounts. All of the counts were confirmed. The results in Georgia were counted three times. It did not change the outcome. The recount conducted in Wisconsin actually saw our margin grow. The margin we had in Michigan was fourteen times the margin President Trump won the state by four years ago. Our margin in Pennsylvania was nearly twice the size of President Trump's margin four years ago. And yet none of this has stopped baseless claims about the legitimacy of the results. Even more stunning, 17 Republican Attorneys General and 126 Republican Members of Congress actually signed on to a lawsuit filed by the State of Texas. It asked the United States Supreme Court to reject the certified vote counts in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. This legal maneuver was an effort by elected officials in one group of states to try to get the Supreme Court to wipe out the votes of more than twenty million Americans in other states and to hand the presidency to a candidate who lost the Electoral College, lost the popular vote, and lost each and every one of the states whose votes they were trying to reverse. It's a position so extreme we've never seen it before. A position that refused to respect the will of the people, refused to respect the rule of law, and refused to honor our Constitution. Thankfully, a unanimous Supreme Court immediately and completely rejected this effort. The Court sent a clear signal to President Trump and his allies that they would be no part of this unprecedented assault on our democracy. Every avenue was made available to President Trump to contest the results. He took full advantage of each and every one of these avenues. President Trump was denied no course of action he wanted to take. He took his case to Republican Governors and Republican Secretaries of State. To Republican state legislatures. To Republican-appointed judges at every level. And in a case decided after the Supreme Court's latest rejection, a judge appointed by President Trump wrote: \"This court has allowed the plaintiff the chance to make his case, and he has lost on the merits.\" Even President Trump's own cybersecurity chief overseeing our elections said it was the most secure in American history. Let me say it again, his own cybersecurity chief overseeing this election said it was the most secure in American history. Respecting the will of the people is at the heart of our democracy , even when we find those results hard to accept. But that is the obligation of those who have taken a sworn duty to uphold our Constitution. Four years ago, as the sitting Vice President of the United States, it was my responsibility to announce the tally of the Electoral College votes that elected Donald Trump. I did my job. And I am pleased , but not surprised , that a number of my former Republican colleagues in the Senate have acknowledged the results of the Electoral College. I thank them. I am convinced we can work together for the good of the nation. That is the duty owed to the people, to our Constitution, and to history. In this battle for the soul of America, democracy prevailed. We the People voted. Faith in our institutions held. The integrity of our elections remains intact.Now it is time to turn the page as we've done throughout our history. To unite. To heal. As I said through this campaign, I will be a president for all Americans. I will work just as hard for those of you who didn't vote for me, as I will for those who did. There is urgent work in front of us all. Getting the pandemic under control and getting the nation vaccinated against this virus. Delivering immediate economic help so badly needed by so many Americans who are hurting today , and then building our economy back better than ever. In doing so, we need to work together, give each other a chance, and lower the temperature. And most of all, we need to stand in solidarity as fellow Americans. To see each other, our pains, our struggles, our hopes, our dreams. We are a great nation. We are a good people. We may come from different places and hold different beliefs, but we share a love for this country. A belief in its limitless possibilities. For we, the United States of America, have always set the example for the world for the peaceful transition of power. We will do so again. I know the task before us will not be easy. It's tempered by the pain so many of us are feeling. Today, our nation passed a grim milestone, 300,000 deaths due to this virus. My heart goes out to all of you in this dark winter of the pandemic about to spend the holidays and the new year with a black hole in your hearts and without the ones you love by your side. My heart goes out to all of you who have fallen on hard times through no fault of your own, unable to sleep at night, weighed down with the worry of what tomorrow will bring for you and for your family. But we have faced difficult times before in our history. And I know we will get through this one, together. And so, as we start the hard work to be done, may this moment give us the strength to rebuild this house of ours upon a rock that can never be washed away. And as in the Prayer of St. Francis, for where there is discord, union; where there is doubt, faith, where there is darkness, light. This is who we are as a nation. This is the America we love. And that is the America we will be. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops and all those who stand watch over our democracy.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1490763\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-the-electoral-college-vote-certification-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Elections","Source":null,"Location":"Wilmington, DE","Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-the-electoral-college-vote-certification-in-wilmington-delaware\/","CleanText":"Good evening, my fellow Americans.

I think about how that day eight years ago was the saddest day we had in the White House. Twenty first-graders. Their six educators. And I think about the time we have spent with each other grieving since then. I remain in awe of you. I have heard from and watched as so many of you turned pain into purpose, working to change our laws and our culture around gun violence and how we protect and nurture our children.

{"SpeechID":"VSJB16122020181","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-12-16","SpeechTitle":"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by President-elect Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware","Type":"speech","RawText":"Good afternoon. Over the past few weeks, Vice President-elect Harris and I have been announcing nominees for our Cabinet. They are people of the highest character, of varied experiences and backgrounds who will help us beat the pandemic, keep us safe and secure, and build our economy back better than ever. They include longtime colleagues and new faces and voices. They include people who share my views, and those who have different views. And it includes people who supported my campaign from its earliest days and people who ran against me. They are experts in policy, leaders tested by crisis, and by the end of this process, this Cabinet will be the most representative of any in our history. It will have more people of color than any cabinet, ever. It will have more women than any cabinet, ever. It will be a cabinet of barrier breakers. A cabinet of firsts. I know how proud Presidents are when they are able to achieve a first in their cabinet. I remember when President Clinton named the first ever woman to be Secretary of State. I was there when President Obama named the first ever Black Attorney General. But compared to its predecessors, the Biden-Harris Cabinet is first among Cabinets for all of the firsts it represents. The first ever woman, the first Black woman, and woman of South Asian descent, as Vice President. The first ever Black Secretary of Defense. The first ever Latino head of DHS and the first ever Latino head of HHS. The first woman and South Asian American to lead OMB. The first woman and Asian American to lead USTR. The first Black woman to chair the President's Council of Economic Advisors. And the first ever woman to hold Alexander Hamilton's position as Treasury Secretary. Our Cabinet does not just have one first or just two of these firsts, but eight precedent-busting appointments. And today, a ninth: the first ever openly gay nominee to lead a Cabinet department, and one of the youngest Cabinet members ever. The Biden-Harris Cabinet will be a historic Cabinet. A Cabinet that looks like America. A Cabinet that taps into the best of America. A Cabinet that is opening doors and breaking down barriers and accessing the full range of talent we have in this nation. A Cabinet that is up to the immediate crisis we're in, and the long-term challenges this nation faces in the future. It's a Cabinet that's battle-tested. Qualified. Experienced. Creative. Innovative. Forward-looking. And yes , representative. And today, I am proud to nominate its newest member. For Secretary of Transportation, I nominate Mayor Pete Buttigieg. I got to know Pete on the campaign trail. One of the smartest people you will ever meet. And one of the most humble. Mayor from the heartland, a management expert, and a policy wonk with a big heart. A veteran. Lt. in the U.S. Navy Reserves. Intelligence officer. Deployed to Afghanistan while he was Mayor. A new voice with new ideas, determined to move past the old politics. A son of professors. His husband is an educator , always a mark of good character. Jill and I always enjoyed seeing Pete and Chasten together on the trail. And what I admire about Pete is he's always clear about who he is, what he believes, and how he wants to bring people in. He's able to walk into any room and leave people inspired with his ability to describe an America that's the best of us. That's hopeful. Bold. Creative. Inclusive. An America that can do anything. The Department of Transportation services a critical mission with critical responsibilities. We need someone who knows how to work with state, local, and federal agencies. For example, right now, one in five miles of our highways are still in \"poor condition\" according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. Tens and tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair, some on the verge of collapse, presenting a clear and present danger to people's lives. We are the world's richest nation, but rank just 10th in the overall quality of our infrastructure, according to the World Economic Forum. But there's so much we can do. When I think of climate change, I think about jobs, good-paying union jobs. Jobs that put Americans to work, making our air cleaner for our kids to breathe, restoring our crumbling roads, bridges, and ports, making it faster, cheaper, and cleaner to transport American-made goods all across the country and the world. Jobs that lay the lines for the second great railroad revolution, which will not only slash pollution, but will slash commute times, open up investments in areas connected to metropolitan areas for the first time. We selected Pete for Transportation because the Department is at the intersection of some of our most ambitious plans to build back better. When President Obama put me in charge of implementing the Recovery Act to take us from crisis to recovery to resurgence, modernizing our transportation infrastructure , our roads, bridges, ports , were some of our most critical investments. We invested more in infrastructure since President Eisenhower's interstate highway system. They are projects that traditionally receive bipartisan support, that forge public and private partnerships so we pull more private investment from every dollar of federal investment. And they put millions of Americans to work strengthening our economic competitiveness and rebuilding our communities for the future. Pete's got the perspective of a mayor that solves problems and brings people together. He's got the vision of a next-generation leader with the experience and temperament to lead the charge today, to dig us out of this economic crisis. For example, helping cities and states to keep transit systems running for frontline and essential workers, and then helping them modernize their airports, ports, and railways to attract and retain businesses and workers. To advance racial equity as we build back better and include everyone, so zip code doesn't determine access to good jobs, schools, and health care. To deal with the existential threat of climate change with jobs. Helping cities across this country , in red states and blue states , build more climate resilient communities to deal with more extreme floods, droughts, and superstorms. Working with states, business, and labor to install 500,000 charging stations for the next generation of clean vehicles, smart grid systems that reduce energy consumption, and to usher in a clean energy economy all across the country. He'll carry out the Department's duty to keep Americans safe on our roads and railways, and in our skies. And Pete will help us build back better with jobs and hope, with vision and execution. I am honored he is answering the call to serve our country again. Please welcome the next Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1491347\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Executive Branch","Source":null,"Location":"Wilmington, DE","Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware-7\/","CleanText":"Good afternoon.

Today I am pleased to announce the team that will lead my Administration's ambitious plan to address an existential threat of our time , climate change. Like their fellow-Cabinet nominees and appointments, members of our environment and energy team are brilliant, qualified and tested, and barrier-busting. With today's announcements there will be six African American members of our Cabinet. A record. After today, our Cabinet won't just have one or two precedent-breaking appointments, but 12 , including today's long-overdue appointment of the first Native American Cabinet Secretary. Already there are more people of color in this Cabinet than any Cabinet ever. More women than ever. The Biden-Harris Cabinet will be an historic Cabinet. A Cabinet that looks like America. That taps into the best of America. That opens doors and includes the full range of talents we have in this nation. And like the rest of the team, today's nominees are ready on Day One, which is essential because we literally have no time to lose. Just this year, wildfires burned more than 5 million acres in California, Washington, and across the West , an area roughly the size of the entire state of New Jersey. Intense and powerful hurricanes and tropical storms pummeled Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, and across the Gulf and along the East Coast. Record floods, hurricane-speed windstorms, and severe droughts ravaged the Midwest. And more Americans see and feel the devastation in big cities and small towns, on coastlines and farmlands, in red states and blue states. Billions of dollars in damage. Homes and memories washed away. Small businesses closed up for good. Crops and farmlands destroyed for the next generation family farmer. Just last year, the Defense Department reported that climate change is a direct threat to more than two-thirds of the military's operationally critical installations. And this could well be a conservative estimate. And so many climate and health calamities are colliding at once. It's not just a pandemic that keeps people inside , it's poor air quality. Multiple studies have shown air pollution is associated with an increased risk of death from Covid-19. Folks, we're in a crisis. Just like we need a unified national response to COVID-19, we need a unified national response to climate change. We need to meet this moment with the urgency it demands as we would during any national emergency. And from the crisis, we need to seize the opportunity to build back better than we were before.That's what this Administration will do. When we think about climate change, we think \"jobs.\" Good-paying union jobs. A key plank of our Build Back Better economic plan is building a modern, climate-resilient infrastructure and clean energy future. We can put millions of Americans to work modernizing water, transportation, and energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme weather. When we think about renewable energy, we see American manufacturing, American workers, racing to lead the global market. We see farmers making American agriculture first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions and gaining new sources of income in the process. We see the small businesses and master electricians designing and installing innovative, energy-conserving buildings and homes. This will reduce electricity consumption and save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs. And we will challenge everyone to step up. We will bring America back into the Paris Agreement and put us back in the business of leading the world on climate change. The current Administration reversed the Obama-Biden fuel-efficiency standards and picked Big Oil companies over the American workers. Our Administration will not only bring those standards back , we will set new, ambitious ones that our workers are ready to meet. We see American workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations across the country. We see American consumers switching to electric vehicles through rebates and incentives. Not only that , the federal government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles. And we're going to harness the purchasing power of our federal government to make sure we are buying clean, electric vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in America. All together, this will mean one million new jobs in the American auto industry. And we'll do another big thing: put us on a path of achieving a carbon-pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 that no future president can turn back. Transforming the American electricity sector to produce power without carbon pollution will be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st Century, not to mention the benefits to our health and our environment. But we need to get to work right away. We'll need scientists at national labs, land-grant universities, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities to innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean electricity. We'll need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them. We'll need ironworkers and welders to install them. That's how we'll become the world's largest exporter of these technologies, creating even more jobs. We know how to do this. The Obama-Biden Administration rescued the auto industry and helped them retool. We made solar energy cost-competitive with traditional energy and weatherized more than a million homes. The Recovery Act made record clean energy investments , $90 Billion , on everything from smart grid systems to clean energy manufacturing. We will do it again , bigger, and faster, and better than before. We'll also build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that will benefit our communities three-times over by alleviating the affordable housing crisis, by increasing energy efficiency, and by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to homeownership. We'll create more than a quarter-million jobs right away, to do things like working toward plugging the 3.2 million abandoned oil and gas wells that the EPA says pose an ongoing threat to the health and safety of our communities. We'll launch a new, modern-day Civilian Climate Corps to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. And I believe that every American has a fundamental right to breathe clean air and drink clean water. But I know that we haven't fulfilled that right. No, we haven't fulfilled that right for a generation or more in places like Cancer Alley in Louisiana or along the Route 9 corridor right here in Delaware. Fulfilling this basic obligation to all Americans, especially in low-income white, Black, Brown, and Native American communities who too often don't have clean air and clean water is not going to be easy. But it is necessary. And we are committed to facing climate change by delivering environmental justice. These aren't pie-in-the-sky dreams. These are concrete, actionable solutions. And this team will get them done. For Secretary of the Interior, I nominate Congresswoman Deb Haaland. She's of the Pueblo people. A 35th-generation New Mexican. She's from a military family. Her mom, also Pueblo, served in the United States Navy. Her dad, Norwegian American, a Marine now buried in Arlington. A single mom, she raised her child while running a small business. When times were tough, they relied on food stamps. Congresswoman Haaland graduated from law school and got involved in politics. Two years ago, she became one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress. She serves on the Armed Services Committee, and Committee on Natural Resources, and Chairs the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands, where she's earned the respectof a broad coalition of people , from tribal leaders to environmental groups to labor. As the first Native American Cabinet Secretary in the history of the United States of America, she will be a true steward of our national parks, natural resources, and all of our lands. The federal government has long broken promises to Native American tribes who have been on this land since time immemorial. With her appointment, Congresswoman Haaland will help me strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship, and I am honored she accepted this critical role. For Secretary of Energy, I nominate Jennifer Granholm. The first woman to ever serve as Governor of Michigan. In 2009, she faced the collapse of a defining industry of her state and our nation. But I saw firsthand how she responded. She bet on the autoworkers. She bet on the promise of a clean energy future. Her leadership helped rescue the American auto industry, helped save one million American jobs, and helped bring Detroit back. Governor Granholm is just like the state she led so effectively for eight years: hard-working, resilient, and forward-thinking. Someone not only capable of solving urgent problems, but someone who sees the opportunities of the future always with her eyes on the needs and aspirations of working people. Throughout her career, she's worked with states, cities, business, and labor to promote a clean energy future with new jobs, new industries, cleaner and more affordable energy. Now, I'm asking her to bring that vision and faith in America to the Department of Energy. For Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, I nominate Michael Regan. A proud son of North Carolina, he turned a passion for exploring the woods and waters of the Inner Coastal Plain into a deep expertise in environmental science. He got his start at the EPA serving in both Democratic and Republican Administrations, working on everything from reducing air pollution to improving energy efficiency. He currently serves as Secretary of North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality,where he's brought people together across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to help build a new clean energy economy, creating quality jobs, and confronting climate change. He led the charge to clean up the Cape Fear River, contaminated for years by dangerous toxic chemicals. And he created North Carolina's first board of its kind to address environmental justice and equity. It helps lift up frontline and fenceline communities who had carried the burdens of industrial progress for too long, without sharing in the benefits. Michael would be the second African American official and first African American man to serve in this position. He shares my belief in forging consensus and finding common purpose. He is the leader who will reassert the EPA's place as the world's premier environmental protection agency that safeguards our planet, protects our lives, and strengthens our economy for all Americans. For Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, I nominate Brenda Mallory. An accomplished public servant. A brilliant environmental lawyer. A daughter of a working-class family who has dedicated her life to solving the most complex environmental challenges facing America. She has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, helping safeguard our public lands and helping communities manage their natural resources responsibly. As Chair of CEQ, I'm asking her to coordinate our environmental efforts across the entire federal government to solve some of the most persistent environmental problems America faces today. Brenda would be the first African American official to hold this critical position. We are fortunate that one of the most widely respected environmental leaders in the country accepted the call to serve again. To serve as the first-ever National Climate Advisor and lead the newly formed White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, I appoint Gina McCarthy. The fact I've asked a former EPA Administrator to take this role and lead this new office shows how serious I am. Gina's got more than 30 years of experience. She's a policy wonk and a people person. A problem-solver and coalition builder. As EPA Administrator, she was instrumental in carrying out the Obama-Biden Climate Action Plan. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Getting toxins out of the air we breathe. Conserving critical water sources. She led our effort to help lower carbon emissions of existing power plants and power plants of the future. And by doing the necessary work here at home, she helped us rally the world around the Paris Climate Accords. Today, I'm asking her to take a singular focus on carrying out our ambitious climate agendahere at home, while my Special Envoy John Kerry leads our climate efforts around the world. I'm grateful to work alongside her again. And to serve as Deputy National Climate Advisor, I appoint Ali Zaidi. He served as a top climate advisor to President Obama and me at the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council. He helped draft and implement our Climate Action Plan and secure the Paris Climate Agreement. He currently serves as New York's Deputy Secretary of Energy and Environment and the State's Chairman of Climate Policy and Finance. He's helping to create jobs generating solar and wind power, jobs building electric charging stations and a more modern grid, bold climate action grounded in science, economics, and public health. And, he's an immigrant from Pakistan who grew up in the Rust Belt, outside Erie, Pennsylvania. Ali knows we can beat the climate crisis with jobs. He knows we can deliver environmental justice and revitalize communities too often overlooked and forgotten. And every day he'll walk into the White House, knowing the world is looking for America to lead. To each of you, thank you for answering the call to serve. To your families, thank you. We could not do this without you or them. To the career civil servants at these agencies, we look forward to working with you to once again carry out your department's mission with honor and integrity. And to the American people , yes, the goals I've laid today are bold. The challenges ahead are daunting. But I want you to know that we can do this. We must do this. And we will do this. We are America. And there's nothing we can't do when we work together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. I'll now turn it over to the team, starting with our next Secretary of the Interior, Congresswoman Deb Haaland.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1491747\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Executive Branch Environment","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware-8\/","CleanText":"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by President-elect Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware Good afternoon. Today I am pleased to announce the team that will lead my Administration's ambitious plan to address an existential threat of our time , climate change. Like their fellow-Cabinet nominees and appointments, members of our environment and energy team are brilliant, qualified and tested, and barrier-busting. With today's announcements there will be six African American members of our Cabinet. A record. After today, our Cabinet won't just have one or two precedent-breaking appointments, but 12 , including today's long-overdue appointment of the first Native American Cabinet Secretary. Already there are more people of color in this Cabinet than any Cabinet ever. More women than ever. The Biden-Harris Cabinet will be an historic Cabinet. A Cabinet that looks like America. That taps into the best of America. That opens doors and includes the full range of talents we have in this nation. And like the rest of the team, today's nominees are ready on Day One, which is essential because we literally have no time to lose. Just this year, wildfires burned more than 5 million acres in California, Washington, and across the West , an area roughly the size of the entire state of New Jersey. Intense and powerful hurricanes and tropical storms pummeled Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, and across the Gulf and along the East Coast. Record floods, hurricane-speed windstorms, and severe droughts ravaged the Midwest. And more Americans see and feel the devastation in big cities and small towns, on coastlines and farmlands, in red states and blue states. Billions of dollars in damage. Homes and memories washed away. Small businesses closed up for good. Crops and farmlands destroyed for the next generation family farmer. Just last year, the Defense Department reported that climate change is a direct threat to more than two-thirds of the military's operationally critical installations. And this could well be a conservative estimate. And so many climate and health calamities are colliding at once. It's not just a pandemic that keeps people inside , it's poor air quality. Multiple studies have shown air pollution is associated with an increased risk of death from Covid-19. Folks, we're in a crisis. Just like we need a unified national response to COVID-19, we need a unified national response to climate change. We need to meet this moment with the urgency it demands as we would during any national emergency. And from the crisis, we need to seize the opportunity to build back better than we were before.That's what this Administration will do. When we think about climate change, we think 'jobs.' Good-paying union jobs. A key plank of our Build Back Better economic plan is building a modern, climate-resilient infrastructure and clean energy future. We can put millions of Americans to work modernizing water, transportation, and energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme weather. When we think about renewable energy, we see American manufacturing, American workers, racing to lead the global market. We see farmers making American agriculture first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions and gaining new sources of income in the process. We see the small businesses and master electricians designing and installing innovative, energy-conserving buildings and homes. This will reduce electricity consumption and save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs. And we will challenge everyone to step up. We will bring America back into the Paris Agreement and put us back in the business of leading the world on climate change. The current Administration reversed the Obama-Biden fuel-efficiency standards and picked Big Oil companies over the American workers. Our Administration will not only bring those standards back , we will set new, ambitious ones that our workers are ready to meet. We see American workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations across the country. We see American consumers switching to electric vehicles through rebates and incentives. Not only that , the federal government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles. And we're going to harness the purchasing power of our federal government to make sure we are buying clean, electric vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in America. All together, this will mean one million new jobs in the American auto industry. And we'll do another big thing: put us on a path of achieving a carbon-pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 that no future president can turn back. Transforming the American electricity sector to produce power without carbon pollution will be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st Century, not to mention the benefits to our health and our environment. But we need to get to work right away. We'll need scientists at national labs, land-grant universities, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities to innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean electricity. We'll need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them. We'll need ironworkers and welders to install them. That's how we'll become the world's largest exporter of these technologies, creating even more jobs. We know how to do this. The Obama-Biden Administration rescued the auto industry and helped them retool. We made solar energy cost-competitive with traditional energy and weatherized more than a million homes. The Recovery Act made record clean energy investments , $90 Billion , on everything from smart grid systems to clean energy manufacturing. We will do it again , bigger, and faster, and better than before. We'll also build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that will benefit our communities three-times over by alleviating the affordable housing crisis, by increasing energy efficiency, and by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to homeownership. We'll create more than a quarter-million jobs right away, to do things like working toward plugging the 3.2 million abandoned oil and gas wells that the EPA says pose an ongoing threat to the health and safety of our communities. We'll launch a new, modern-day Civilian Climate Corps to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. And I believe that every American has a fundamental right to breathe clean air and drink clean water. But I know that we haven't fulfilled that right. No, we haven't fulfilled that right for a generation or more in places like Cancer Alley in Louisiana or along the Route 9 corridor right here in Delaware. Fulfilling this basic obligation to all Americans, especially in low-income white, Black, Brown, and Native American communities who too often don't have clean air and clean water is not going to be easy. But it is necessary. And we are committed to facing climate change by delivering environmental justice. These aren't pie-in-the-sky dreams. These are concrete, actionable solutions. And this team will get them done. For Secretary of the Interior, I nominate Congresswoman Deb Haaland. She's of the Pueblo people. A 35th-generation New Mexican. She's from a military family. Her mom, also Pueblo, served in the United States Navy. Her dad, Norwegian American, a Marine now buried in Arlington. A single mom, she raised her child while running a small business. When times were tough, they relied on food stamps. Congresswoman Haaland graduated from law school and got involved in politics. Two years ago, she became one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress. She serves on the Armed Services Committee, and Committee on Natural Resources, and Chairs the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands, where she's earned the respectof a broad coalition of people , from tribal leaders to environmental groups to labor. As the first Native American Cabinet Secretary in the history of the United States of America, she will be a true steward of our national parks, natural resources, and all of our lands. The federal government has long broken promises to Native American tribes who have been on this land since time immemorial. With her appointment, Congresswoman Haaland will help me strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship, and I am honored she accepted this critical role. For Secretary of Energy, I nominate Jennifer Granholm. The first woman to ever serve as Governor of Michigan. In 2009, she faced the collapse of a defining industry of her state and our nation. But I saw firsthand how she responded. She bet on the autoworkers. She bet on the promise of a clean energy future. Her leadership helped rescue the American auto industry, helped save one million American jobs, and helped bring Detroit back. Governor Granholm is just like the state she led so effectively for eight years: hard-working, resilient, and forward-thinking. Someone not only capable of solving urgent problems, but someone who sees the opportunities of the future always with her eyes on the needs and aspirations of working people. Throughout her career, she's worked with states, cities, business, and labor to promote a clean energy future with new jobs, new industries, cleaner and more affordable energy. Now, I'm asking her to bring that vision and faith in America to the Department of Energy. For Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, I nominate Michael Regan. A proud son of North Carolina, he turned a passion for exploring the woods and waters of the Inner Coastal Plain into a deep expertise in environmental science. He got his start at the EPA serving in both Democratic and Republican Administrations, working on everything from reducing air pollution to improving energy efficiency. He currently serves as Secretary of North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality,where he's brought people together across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to help build a new clean energy economy, creating quality jobs, and confronting climate change. He led the charge to clean up the Cape Fear River, contaminated for years by dangerous toxic chemicals. And he created North Carolina's first board of its kind to address environmental justice and equity. It helps lift up frontline and fenceline communities who had carried the burdens of industrial progress for too long, without sharing in the benefits. Michael would be the second African American official and first African American man to serve in this position. He shares my belief in forging consensus and finding common purpose. He is the leader who will reassert the EPA's place as the world's premier environmental protection agency that safeguards our planet, protects our lives, and strengthens our economy for all Americans. For Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, I nominate Brenda Mallory. An accomplished public servant. A brilliant environmental lawyer. A daughter of a working-class family who has dedicated her life to solving the most complex environmental challenges facing America. She has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, helping safeguard our public lands and helping communities manage their natural resources responsibly. As Chair of CEQ, I'm asking her to coordinate our environmental efforts across the entire federal government to solve some of the most persistent environmental problems America faces today.

This is a model for the challenging work ahead for our nation. This bill provides critical temporary support for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, support to help keep families in their homes, and food on their table; and direct payments to help Americans make it through a dark winter.

Before I take questions, I'd like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. This has been one of the toughest years we've ever faced as a nation. The pandemic. The economic crisis. The calls for racial justice. Historic and punishing wildfires and storms. So, this season of reflection carries a deeper meaning. With over 320,000 lives lost to this virus, Jill and I send our prayers to all of you facing this dark winter with an empty seat at the dinner table where your loved one used to sit, talk, and laugh. Our hearts go out to all of you who have fallen on hard times through no fault of your own, unable to sleep at night, weighed down with the worry of what tomorrow will bring for you and for your family. We're especially grateful to the health care workers on the frontlines , the scientists, researchers, and clinical trial participants on the frontiers of the vaccine who delivered a scientific breakthrough. And for all of you who have a deployed family member in the military , we know from personal experience how difficult that can be especially at this time of year. Our family knows your sacrifice. And our hearts are always with you. Throughout this year we've had to forego many of the favorite traditions we have as families, communities, and as a country. For the Biden's, we usually have 20-25 family members over for Christmas. But not this year. Like we did over Thanksgiving, we all have to care enough for each other that we have to stay apart just a little longer. I know it's hard. But we have a long way to go. We are grateful that we got the vaccine. And yesterday, in an effort to instill confidence in the vaccine, I had my shot administered in public. I look forward to the second shot, and I have absolute confidence in the vaccine. But we're short on supply. And taking the vaccine from a vial and into the arms of millions of Americans will be the biggest operational challenge we've ever faced. It will take many more months for that to happen. In the meantime, the pandemic rages on. Experts say things will get worse notwithstanding the vaccine. We're averaging a death rate of close to 3,000 a day. That means we will lose tens of thousands of more lives in the months to come, and the vaccine won't be able to stop that. So we still have to remain vigilant. We need everyone to mask up, stay socially distant, and avoid large gatherings. And we need to work in a bipartisan way. That's the only way we'll get through this. I applaud the bipartisan Congressional economic relief package that included funding for vaccine distribution and much needed temporary relief for workers, families, and small businesses. In this election the American people made it clear , they want us to reach across the aisle, work together, and get something done. I believed that to be the case from the very beginning and I'm happy to see Members of Congress heed that message from their constituents. The leaders in both the House and the Senate in both parties deserve credit for making the hard compromises to get this done. Like all compromises, it's far from perfect. But it does provide vital relief at a critical time. However, as I have said all along, this bill is just a first step , a down payment , on addressing the crisis we're in. We have a lot more work to do. Early next year I will put before the Congress my plans for what comes next. We will need more help to fully distribute the vaccine. We need more testing in order to reopen our schools. We need more funding to help firefighters and police, many of whom are being laid off. The same with nurses risking their lives on the frontlines. The same for the millions of families hurting and unable to put food on the table or pay rent or a mortgage. Congress did its job this week. It can and must do it again next year.But even with the changes in approach I will put in place in late January, people will still be getting sick and dying from COVID. One thing I promise you about my leadership during this crisis, I'm going to tell it to you straight. And here's the simple truth. Our darkest days in this battle against COVID are ahead of us, not behind us. So, we need to prepare ourselves and steel our spines. As frustrating as it is to hear it's going to take patience and persistence and determination to beat this virus. There will be no time to waste in taking the steps we need to turn this crisis around. My administration will start to do its part on its first day , with masking requirements, a new strategy on testing, and accelerated production of protective gear. And we will challenge the Congress and the American people to step up immediately as well. As with the relief bill passed by Congress, there is another challenge which my administration will confront on a bipartisan basis , the massive cybersecurity breach against U.S. companies and federal agencies. There is still so much that we don't know, including the full scope of the breach or the extent of the damage it has caused. But we know this much , this attack constitutes a grave risk to our national security. It was carefully planned and orchestrated. It was carried out using sophisticated cyber tools. The attackers succeeded in catching the federal government off-guard and unprepared. Foreign actors have been working on this breach since at least last year, setting the landscape to compromise our systems, scraping up sensitive information from our world-class tech sector, from private businesses, and from United States government agencies. And the truth is that the Trump Administration failed to prioritize cyber security. From eliminating and\/or downgrading cyber coordinators at both the White House and the State Department, to firing his Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, to President Trump's irrational downplaying of the seriousness of this attack. In an age when so much of our lives are conducted online, cyber attacks must be treated as a serious threat by our leadership at the highest levels. We cannot let this go unanswered. That means making clear publicly who was responsible for this attack and taking meaningful steps to hold them to account. Initial indications, including from Secretary Pompeo and Attorney General Barr suggest that Russia is responsible for this breach. It certainly fits Russia's long history of reckless and disruptive cyber activities. But the Trump Administration needs to make an official attribution. This assault happened on Donald Trump's watch. It is still his responsibility as president to defend American interests for the next four weeks, but rest assured that even if he does not take this seriously, I will. While I am disappointed by the response of President Trump, I was pleased to see leaders in both parties in Congress speak out loudly and clearly on this attack. Again, I want to thank prominent Republicans in the Senate particularly for speaking out. It is a sign that with a new administration, we can confront these threats on a bipartisan basis with a united front here at home. That should be encouraging to the American people and a warning to our adversaries. In the meantime, the President's team needs to cooperate fully to share information as it becomes available on both the impact and our response to ensure a smooth transition and to protect the American people as administrations change. Over the next month I intend to continue focusing on building my team so that the right peopleare in place on day one of my administration to take over this effort, and to prioritize cyber security across the board. And I will consult with experts to plan for the steps that my administration will need to take in order to secure our systems, improve our cyber defenses to better withstand the future attackswe know will come, and to impose costs on those who conduct them. Our adversaries are highly capable. Cyber threats are among the greatest threats to our global security in the 21st Century. I believe we must treat them with the same seriousness of purpose that we treated the threat of other unconventional weapons. We must work with our allies to establish clear international rules and mechanisms to enforce them and consequences for those that violate them. I'll close with this. As I look at the first of what will be millions of vaccinations going into the arms of Americans after hundreds of thousands of lives lost. At Congress finally passing an economic relief package after months and months of delay. At a new urgency for a bipartisan approach to cybersecurity after years of a President who has refused to stand up to our adversaries and hold them to account. I'm reminded of a quote about this season from the Jesuit Priest Alfred Delp. He wrote, \"Advent is the time for rousing.\" Delp believed that first we are shaken to our depths. Then we're ready for a season of hope. As a nation, we have certainly been shaken to our depths this year. Now it's time to awaken, to get moving , for hope. We've gotten through tough times before in this nation. And we'll get through these difficult times as well. And we'll do it by coming together by working with one another. By being what we are at our best , the United States of America. Certain things are beyond partisan interests. They are national interests. They require us to cooperate. I'm confident we can do that. After a year of pain and loss, it's time to unite, to heal, to rebuild. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to you all. I'll now take your questions.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1492002\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Health and Health Care Economy and Fiscal","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware-9\/","CleanText":"Good afternoon.

I believed that to be the case from the very beginning and I'm happy to see Members of Congress heed that message from their constituents. The leaders in both the House and the Senate in both parties deserve credit for making the hard compromises to get this done. Like all compromises, it's far from perfect. But it does provide vital relief at a critical time. However, as I have said all along, this bill is just a first step , a down payment , on addressing the crisis we're in. We have a lot more work to do. Early next year I will put before the Congress my plans for what comes next. We will need more help to fully distribute the vaccine. We need more testing in order to reopen our schools. We need more funding to help firefighters and police, many of whom are being laid off. The same with nurses risking their lives on the frontlines. The same for the millions of families hurting and unable to put food on the table or pay rent or a mortgage. Congress did its job this week. It can and must do it again next year.But even with the changes in approach I will put in place in late January, people will still be getting sick and dying from COVID. One thing I promise you about my leadership during this crisis, I'm going to tell it to you straight. And here's the simple truth. Our darkest days in this battle against COVID are ahead of us, not behind us. So, we need to prepare ourselves and steel our spines. As frustrating as it is to hear it's going to take patience and persistence and determination to beat this virus. There will be no time to waste in taking the steps we need to turn this crisis around. My administration will start to do its part on its first day , with masking requirements, a new strategy on testing, and accelerated production of protective gear. And we will challenge the Congress and the American people to step up immediately as well. As with the relief bill passed by Congress, there is another challenge which my administration will confront on a bipartisan basis , the massive cybersecurity breach against U.S. companies and federal agencies. There is still so much that we don't know, including the full scope of the breach or the extent of the damage it has caused. But we know this much , this attack constitutes a grave risk to our national security. It was carefully planned and orchestrated. It was carried out using sophisticated cyber tools. The attackers succeeded in catching the federal government off-guard and unprepared. Foreign actors have been working on this breach since at least last year, setting the landscape to compromise our systems, scraping up sensitive information from our world-class tech sector, from private businesses, and from United States government agencies. And the truth is that the Trump Administration failed to prioritize cyber security. From eliminating and\/or downgrading cyber coordinators at both the White House and the State Department, to firing his Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, to President Trump's irrational downplaying of the seriousness of this attack. In an age when so much of our lives are conducted online, cyber attacks must be treated as a serious threat by our leadership at the highest levels. We cannot let this go unanswered. That means making clear publicly who was responsible for this attack and taking meaningful steps to hold them to account. Initial indications, including from Secretary Pompeo and Attorney General Barr suggest that Russia is responsible for this breach. It certainly fits Russia's long history of reckless and disruptive cyber activities. But the Trump Administration needs to make an official attribution. This assault happened on Donald Trump's watch. It is still his responsibility as president to defend American interests for the next four weeks, but rest assured that even if he does not take this seriously, I will. While I am disappointed by the response of President Trump, I was pleased to see leaders in both parties in Congress speak out loudly and clearly on this attack. Again, I want to thank prominent Republicans in the Senate particularly for speaking out. It is a sign that with a new administration, we can confront these threats on a bipartisan basis with a united front here at home. That should be encouraging to the American people and a warning to our adversaries. In the meantime, the President's team needs to cooperate fully to share information as it becomes available on both the impact and our response to ensure a smooth transition and to protect the American people as administrations change. Over the next month I intend to continue focusing on building my team so that the right peopleare in place on day one of my administration to take over this effort, and to prioritize cyber security across the board. And I will consult with experts to plan for the steps that my administration will need to take in order to secure our systems, improve our cyber defenses to better withstand the future attackswe know will come, and to impose costs on those who conduct them. Our adversaries are highly capable. Cyber threats are among the greatest threats to our global security in the 21st Century. I believe we must treat them with the same seriousness of purpose that we treated the threat of other unconventional weapons. We must work with our allies to establish clear international rules and mechanisms to enforce them and consequences for those that violate them. I'll close with this. As I look at the first of what will be millions of vaccinations going into the arms of Americans after hundreds of thousands of lives lost. At Congress finally passing an economic relief package after months and months of delay. At a new urgency for a bipartisan approach to cybersecurity after years of a President who has refused to stand up to our adversaries and hold them to account. I'm reminded of a quote about this season from the Jesuit Priest Alfred Delp. He wrote, 'Advent is the time for rousing.' Delp believed that first we are shaken to our depths. Then we're ready for a season of hope. As a nation, we have certainly been shaken to our depths this year. Now it's time to awaken, to get moving , for hope. We've gotten through tough times before in this nation. And we'll get through these difficult times as well. And we'll do it by coming together by working with one another. By being what we are at our best , the United States of America. Certain things are beyond partisan interests. They are national interests. They require us to cooperate. I'm confident we can do that. After a year of pain and loss, it's time to unite, to heal, to rebuild. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to you all. I'll now take your questions."}

Before I take questions, I'd like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. This has been one of the toughest years we've ever faced as a nation. The pandemic. The economic crisis. The calls for racial justice. Historic and punishing wildfires and storms. So, this season of reflection carries a deeper meaning. With over 320,000 lives lost to this virus, Jill and I send our prayers to all of you facing this dark winter with an empty seat at the dinner table where your loved one used to sit, talk, and laugh. Our hearts go out to all of you who have fallen on hard times through no fault of your own, unable to sleep at night, weighed down with the worry of what tomorrow will bring for you and for your family. We're especially grateful to the health care workers on the frontlines , the scientists, researchers, and clinical trial participants on the frontiers of the vaccine who delivered a scientific breakthrough. And for all of you who have a deployed family member in the military , we know from personal experience how difficult that can be especially at this time of year. Our family knows your sacrifice. And our hearts are always with you. Throughout this year we've had to forego many of the favorite traditions we have as families, communities, and as a country. For the Biden's, we usually have 20-25 family members over for Christmas. But not this year. Like we did over Thanksgiving, we all have to care enough for each other that we have to stay apart just a little longer. I know it's hard. But we have a long way to go. We are grateful that we got the vaccine. And yesterday, in an effort to instill confidence in the vaccine, I had my shot administered in public. I look forward to the second shot, and I have absolute confidence in the vaccine. But we're short on supply. And taking the vaccine from a vial and into the arms of millions of Americans will be the biggest operational challenge we've ever faced. It will take many more months for that to happen. In the meantime, the pandemic rages on. Experts say things will get worse notwithstanding the vaccine. We're averaging a death rate of close to 3,000 a day. That means we will lose tens of thousands of more lives in the months to come, and the vaccine won't be able to stop that. So we still have to remain vigilant. We need everyone to mask up, stay socially distant, and avoid large gatherings. And we need to work in a bipartisan way. That's the only way we'll get through this.

{"SpeechID":"VSJB23122020177","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-12-23","SpeechTitle":"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by President-elect Joe Biden on the Nomination for Secretary of Education","Type":"speech","RawText":"Good morning. I'm Joe Biden, Dr. Jill Biden's husband. Just like educators everywhere, being an educator isn't what she does. It's who she is. During this pandemic we've seen once again who our educators are. Selfless. Dedicated. Cut from a true cloth of character and commitment. They represent one of the most critical professions in America. From cradle to career, they give people of all ages the confidence to believe in themselves and equip them to succeed. And as Jill says, any country that out-educates us will out-compete us. And in this critical moment in our nation's history, it's essential that there is an educator serving as Secretary of Education. Today, I'm pleased to announce such a nominee in Dr. Miguel Cardona. Like the other Cabinet nominees and appointments, he is brilliant, qualified, and tested. And he will join a Biden-Harris Cabinet that will be a historic Cabinet. Already there are more people of color in this Cabinet than in the history of the United States. There are more women than ever. The first openly gay Cabinet member. It's a Cabinet that looks like America. That taps into the best of America. That opens doors and includes the full range of talents we have in this nation. And like the rest of the team, Dr. Cardona is ready on Day One. Vice President-elect Harris and I knew we needed an Education Secretary who truly understands what it's been like for educators, administrators, families, caregivers, and students this past year. The worry. The stress. The stretched local budgets that have left educators out of work. The mixed signals from the White House that have left more confusion than calm, that have left so many parents and schools feeling like they're on their own. But we also need someone who knows what it takes to get us through this crisis. Reopening schools safely will be a national priority in a Biden-Harris Administration. Early next year, I will put before the Congress our plans for what comes next. That includes funding to keep educators on the job just like we did during the Recovery Act that saved 400,000 education jobs. And it includes asking Congress to provide the funding needed so we can achieve an ambitious but doable goal , of safely opening a majority of schools by the end of our first 100 days. We can do it if states and cities put strong public health measures in place that we all follow. For example, in our first 100 days, I'll be asking all Americans to mask up for 100 days. We'll require masks in federal buildings and interstate travel, like on trains. And we've been talking with county executives, mayors, and governors of both parties to do the same in cities and states. We can do it if we get schools, districts, communities, and states , the clear guidance and resources they need for so many things that aren't in their already tight budgets. They need funding for testing to help reopen schools. More funding for transportation so students can maintain social distancing on buses. They need it for school buildings, for additional cleaning services, protective equipment, andventilation systems. But to lead the national effort requires an Education Secretary with the skills to partner with educators and state, local, and tribal officials, students, and families. It also requires someone who understands the need to prevent the pandemic from further exacerbating the inequities in our education system that represent a compounding problem. They hold back children. They hold back educators. They hold back our country from fulfilling its potential. Take remote learning. How can it be in America that a parent must drive to the parking lot of a coffee shop or library for WiFi they can't afford at home so their children can sit in the car to participate in class or do their homework? This gap of broadband technology and opportunity could cost some kids a full year or more of learning. That's unacceptable in the United States of America. We need to act now. But it's only just the start. We need someone with the experience to help us build back better with the Biden-Harris education plan. We need to make sure every child in this nation has access to a good education , regardless of their zip code, 0r regardless of their disability. That's why my plan triples funding for Title I schools, which serve the highest number of children from low-income families. We need to make sure every child will have access to high-quality universal pre-K. We need to finally pay teachers what they deserve. The work they do is of extreme national importance , their salaries should reflect that. But they can't do it alone. So we're going to make an unprecedented investment: to double the number of school psychologists, counselors, nurses, and social workers in our schools. When trained professionals are helping care for students' mental health and behavioral needs along with concerns around things like housing and food, it frees up educators to focus on teaching and the other critical work they do in the classroom. We'll make sure students with disabilities have the support to succeed by fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. We'll upgrade school infrastructure to make sure classrooms are safe, and build schools that are hubs of innovation and cutting-edge learning. We know that in the 21st Century 12 years of school isn't enough. And that young people are getting crushed by the burden of student debt. Under our legislative plan, we have a number of policies to provide affordable higher education and alleviate that financial burden. This includes anyone able to get into community college will be able to go for free. Public colleges and universities will be tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year. We'll cut student loan payments by half for those using income-based repayment. If you're making $25,000 or less per year, you won't owe a dime in payments or interest. If you make more than that, you'll only pay a small percentage of your income. Our legislative plan also means that if you choose to go into public service, whether you're a teacher, a paramedic, counseling victims of domestic violence, or whatever else, it's only right that your country wipe out your student debt altogether. And it includes forgiving debt from undergraduate public tuition if you're earning less than $125,000 a year. And it means immediately forgiving $10,000 in student debt in the midst of this economic crisis. We'll also invest more than $70 billion in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions to help prepare their graduates like our Vice President-elect for good-paying jobs in industries of the future. There is so much we can do. We can build an economy that eases the financial burden of the caregiving crisis and make sure working families don't pay more than 7% of their income on child care for their young children. And like we did during the Obama-Biden Administration, we can combat campus sexual assault under Title IX , something the Trump Administration and the current Secretary of Education have only undermined. The bottom line is we can achieve all of these critical things but we need someone who gets thateducation isn't just what we do as a nation. It's who we are. And that's the person I am proud to announce today. For Secretary of Education, I nominate Dr. Miguel Cardona. A fourth-grade public school teacher. The youngest principal in the state of Connecticut. And its first Latino official to serve as Education Commissioner. Dr. Cardona rose up the ranks to become assistant superintendent in the same school district he attended as an English learner student. The same district where he was born in public housing, the son and grandson of parents and grandparents who moved from Puerto Rico in search of new opportunities. He made a point of taking new teachers on tours of his district's neighborhoods. The wealthy blocks where students grew up with every resource they needed to get ahead. And the blocks where families were struggling to get by where a new calculator or a nutritious breakfast weren't a given. He understands the deep roots of inequity as the sources of our persistent opportunity gaps. And he understands the transformative power that comes from investing in public education. In our conversations, Dr. Cardona talked about how public education was his great equalizer. It gave him a chance to reach the dream his parents and grandparents had for him. The place where a high school teacher inspired him to be an educator. Public education that helped Miguel become the first in his family to go to college. The first to earn a doctorate. And with that preparation and grounding, Dr. Cardona has brought his heart, knowledge, and passion for education to bear on behalf of all students across Connecticut. And when the pandemic struck, he was ready. He helped secure more than 140,000 laptops and more than 40,000 internet connections for students who lacked them. Because of him, Connecticut became the first state in the nation to ensure that every single public school student was equipped to engage in remote learning, regardless of family income. As the months passed, he followed health guidance and got the funding and resources to provide masks, plexiglass, and testing so schools could reopen and operate safely. That's the vision, resolve, and initiative that will also help us contain the pandemic, reopen schools safely, and build back better. And it's the standard of care that comes from having taught in a classroom, and that comes from a hardworking family who found their way in America through public education. It comes from someone who knows from his core that our nation's children are the kite strings that keep our national ambitions aloft. He is the Secretary of Education for this moment. I thank him and his family for accepting this call to serve. We could not do this without them or him. To the career staff of the Department of Education, you will have a fantastic and trusted leader who will help you carry out your Department's mission with the honor and integrity of an educator.

I'll now turn it over to the next Secretary of Education, Dr. Miguel Cardona.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1492012\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-the-nomination-for-secretary-of-education&speechType=1","Summary":"Executive Branch Education","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware-10\/","CleanText":"Good morning. I'm Joe Biden, Dr. Jill Biden's husband. Just like educators everywhere, being an educator isn't what she does. It's who she is. During this pandemic we've seen once again who our educators are. Selfless. Dedicated. Cut from a true cloth of character and commitment. They represent one of the most critical professions in America. From cradle to career, they give people of all ages the confidence to believe in themselves and equip them to succeed. And as Jill says, any country that out-educates us will out-compete us. And in this critical moment in our nation's history, it's essential that there is an educator serving as Secretary of Education. Today, I'm pleased to announce such a nominee in Dr. Miguel Cardona. Like the other Cabinet nominees and appointments, he is brilliant, qualified, and tested. And he will join a Biden-Harris Cabinet that will be a historic Cabinet. Already there are more people of color in this Cabinet than in the history of the United States. There are more women than ever. The first openly gay Cabinet member. It's a Cabinet that looks like America. That taps into the best of America. That opens doors and includes the full range of talents we have in this nation. And like the rest of the team, Dr. Cardona is ready on Day One. Vice President-elect Harris and I knew we needed an Education Secretary who truly understands what it's been like for educators, administrators, families, caregivers, and students this past year. The worry. The stress. The stretched local budgets that have left educators out of work. The mixed signals from the White House that have left more confusion than calm, that have left so many parents and schools feeling like they're on their own. But we also need someone who knows what it takes to get us through this crisis. Reopening schools safely will be a national priority in a Biden-Harris Administration. Early next year, I will put before the Congress our plans for what comes next. That includes funding to keep educators on the job just like we did during the Recovery Act that saved 400,000 education jobs. And it includes asking Congress to provide the funding needed so we can achieve an ambitious but doable goal , of safely opening a majority of schools by the end of our first 100 days. We can do it if states and cities put strong public health measures in place that we all follow. For example, in our first 100 days, I'll be asking all Americans to mask up for 100 days. We'll require masks in federal buildings and interstate travel, like on trains. And we've been talking with county executives, mayors, and governors of both parties to do the same in cities and states. We can do it if we get schools, districts, communities, and states , the clear guidance and resources they need for so many things that aren't in their already tight budgets. They need funding for testing to help reopen schools. More funding for transportation so students can maintain social distancing on buses. They need it for school buildings, for additional cleaning services, protective equipment, andventilation systems. But to lead the national effort requires an Education Secretary with the skills to partner with educators and state, local, and tribal officials, students, and families. It also requires someone who understands the need to prevent the pandemic from further exacerbating the inequities in our education system that represent a compounding problem. They hold back children. They hold back educators. They hold back our country from fulfilling its potential. Take remote learning. How can it be in America that a parent must drive to the parking lot of a coffee shop or library for WiFi they can't afford at home so their children can sit in the car to participate in class or do their homework? This gap of broadband technology and opportunity could cost some kids a full year or more of learning. That's unacceptable in the United States of America. We need to act now. But it's only just the start. We need someone with the experience to help us build back better with the Biden-Harris education plan. We need to make sure every child in this nation has access to a good education , regardless of their zip code, 0r regardless of their disability. That's why my plan triples funding for Title I schools, which serve the highest number of children from low-income families. We need to make sure every child will have access to high-quality universal pre-K. We need to finally pay teachers what they deserve. The work they do is of extreme national importance , their salaries should reflect that. But they can't do it alone. So we're going to make an unprecedented investment: to double the number of school psychologists, counselors, nurses, and social workers in our schools. When trained professionals are helping care for students' mental health and behavioral needs along with concerns around things like housing and food, it frees up educators to focus on teaching and the other critical work they do in the classroom. We'll make sure students with disabilities have the support to succeed by fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. We'll upgrade school infrastructure to make sure classrooms are safe, and build schools that are hubs of innovation and cutting-edge learning. We know that in the 21st Century 12 years of school isn't enough. And that young people are getting crushed by the burden of student debt. Under our legislative plan, we have a number of policies to provide affordable higher education and alleviate that financial burden. This includes anyone able to get into community college will be able to go for free. Public colleges and universities will be tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year. We'll cut student loan payments by half for those using income-based repayment. If you're making $25,000 or less per year, you won't owe a dime in payments or interest. If you make more than that, you'll only pay a small percentage of your income. Our legislative plan also means that if you choose to go into public service, whether you're a teacher, a paramedic, counseling victims of domestic violence, or whatever else, it's only right that your country wipe out your student debt altogether. And it includes forgiving debt from undergraduate public tuition if you're earning less than $125,000 a year. And it means immediately forgiving $10,000 in student debt in the midst of this economic crisis. We'll also invest more than $70 billion in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions to help prepare their graduates like our Vice President-elect for good-paying jobs in industries of the future. There is so much we can do. We can build an economy that eases the financial burden of the caregiving crisis and make sure working families don't pay more than 7% of their income on child care for their young children. And like we did during the Obama-Biden Administration, we can combat campus sexual assault under Title IX , something the Trump Administration and the current Secretary of Education have only undermined. The bottom line is we can achieve all of these critical things but we need someone who gets thateducation isn't just what we do as a nation. It's who we are. And that's the person I am proud to announce today. For Secretary of Education, I nominate Dr. Miguel Cardona. A fourth-grade public school teacher. The youngest principal in the state of Connecticut. And its first Latino official to serve as Education Commissioner. Dr. Cardona rose up the ranks to become assistant superintendent in the same school district he attended as an English learner student. The same district where he was born in public housing, the son and grandson of parents and grandparents who moved from Puerto Rico in search of new opportunities. He made a point of taking new teachers on tours of his district's neighborhoods. The wealthy blocks where students grew up with every resource they needed to get ahead. And the blocks where families were struggling to get by where a new calculator or a nutritious breakfast weren't a given. He understands the deep roots of inequity as the sources of our persistent opportunity gaps. And he understands the transformative power that comes from investing in public education. In our conversations, Dr. Cardona talked about how public education was his great equalizer. It gave him a chance to reach the dream his parents and grandparents had for him. The place where a high school teacher inspired him to be an educator. Public education that helped Miguel become the first in his family to go to college. The first to earn a doctorate. And with that preparation and grounding, Dr. Cardona has brought his heart, knowledge, and passion for education to bear on behalf of all students across Connecticut. And when the pandemic struck, he was ready. He helped secure more than 140,000 laptops and more than 40,000 internet connections for students who lacked them. Because of him, Connecticut became the first state in the nation to ensure that every single public school student was equipped to engage in remote learning, regardless of family income. As the months passed, he followed health guidance and got the funding and resources to provide masks, plexiglass, and testing so schools could reopen and operate safely. That's the vision, resolve, and initiative that will also help us contain the pandemic, reopen schools safely, and build back better. And it's the standard of care that comes from having taught in a classroom, and that comes from a hardworking family who found their way in America through public education. It comes from someone who knows from his core that our nation's children are the kite strings that keep our national ambitions aloft. He is the Secretary of Education for this moment. I thank him and his family for accepting this call to serve. We could not do this without them or him. To the career staff of the Department of Education, you will have a fantastic and trusted leader who will help you carry out your Department's mission with the honor and integrity of an educator. And to the American people , to educators, families, caregivers, and students , help is on the way. I wish all of you a Merry Christmas and Happy Holiday. May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. I'll now turn it over to the next Secretary of Education, Dr. Miguel Cardona."}

Before I begin, I want to say a few brief words on the explosion that took place Fridayin Nashville. Federal, state, and local law enforcement are working around the clock to gain more information on motive and intent. This bombing was a reminder of the destructive power that individuals and small groups can muster, and the need for continuing vigilance. I want to thank the police officers who worked quickly to evacuate the area before the explosion occurred, and all the firefighters and first responders who jumped into action early on Christmas morning. Their bravery and cool-headedness likely saved lives and prevented a worse outcome , and we are all grateful for that. And I know the hearts of all Americans are with the people of Nashville as they rebuild and recover from this traumatic event. Now, Vice President-elect Harris and I, along with our nominees to lead our national security institutions, have just been briefed by some of the professionals who have been conducting agency reviews as part of our transition. This is a long-standing part of the orderly transition of power in American democracy. We welcomed teams from the incoming Trump-Pence administration four years ago. And over the past few weeks, teams of genuine policy and management experts, many with previous government experience, have gone into agencies across the government to conduct interviews with personnel to gather information and to assess the state of the federal government that we will shortly inherit. These teams worked under incredibly difficult circumstances , taking COVID-19 precautions,and waiting weeks for ascertainment , but they have done an outstanding job. From some agencies, our teams received exemplary cooperation from the career staff. From others, most notably the Department of Defense, we encountered obstruction from the political leadership. And the truth is: many of the agencies that are critical to our security have incurred enormous damage. They've been hollowed out. In personnel. In capacity. In morale. In policy processes that have atrophied or been sidelined. In the disrepair of our alliances. In our absence from key institutions that matter to the welfare of the American people. In a general disengagement from the world. And all of it makes it harder for our government to protect the American people and to defend our vital interests in a world where threats are constantly evolving and our adversaries are constantly adapting. Rebuilding the full set of our instruments of foreign policy and national security is a key challenge that Vice President-elect Harris and I will face upon taking office , starting with our diplomacy. Today, we heard from the leaders of the State and USAID agency review teams about the critical early investments we are going to need to make in our diplomacy, in our development efforts, and in rebuilding our alliances to close ranks with our partners and bring to bear the full benefits of our shared strength for the American people. When we consider the most daunting threats of our time, we know that meeting them requires American engagement and leadership, but also that none of them can be solved by America acting alone. Take climate change for example. The United States accounts for less than 15 percent of global carbon emissions. But without a clear, coordinated, and committed approach from the other 85 percent of carbon emitters, the world will continue to warm, storms will continue to worsen, and climate change will continue to threaten lives and livelihoods, public health, and economies , and our very existence on our planet. We've learned so painfully this year the cost of being unprepared for a pandemic that leaps borders and circles the globe. If we aren't investing with our partners around the world in strengthening health systems everywhere, we're undermining our ability to permanently defeat COVID-19, and we're leaving ourselves vulnerable to the next deadly epidemic. And as we compete with China and hold China's government accountable for its abuses on trade, technology, human rights, and other fronts, our position will be much stronger when we build coalitions of like-minded partners and allies to make common cause with us in defense of our shared interests and values. We are almost 25 percent of the global economy on our own, but together with our democratic partners, we more than double our economic leverage. On any issue that matters to the U.S.-China relationship , from pursuing a foreign policy for the middle class, including a trade and economic agenda that protects American workers, our intellectual property, and the environment , to ensuring security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, to championing human rights , we are stronger and more effective when we are flanked by nations that share our vision for the future of our world. That's how we multiply the impact of our efforts and make those efforts more sustainable. That's the power of smart and effective American leadership. But right now, there's an enormous vacuum. We're going to have to regain the trust and confidence of a world that has begun to find waysto work around us or without us. We also heard from key leaders on our intelligence and defense review teams, including Stephanie O'Sullivan, former principal deputy director of national intelligence, and retired Army Lieutenant General Karen Gibson. We talked about the different strategic challenges we will face from both Russia and China, and the reforms we must make to put ourselves in the strongest possible position to meet these challenges. That includes modernizing our defense priorities to better deter aggression in the future, rather than continuing to over-invest in legacy systems designed to address the threats of the past. And we have to be able to innovate and reimagine our defenses against growing threats in new realms like cyberspace. We are still learning about the extent of the SolarWinds hack and the vulnerabilities that have been exposed. As I said last week , this attack constitutes a grave risk to our national security. And we need to close the gap between where our capabilities are now and where they need to beto better deter, detect, disrupt, and respond to these sorts of intrusions in the future. This is an area where Republicans and Democrats are in agreement , and we should be able to work on a bipartisan basis to better secure the American people against malign cyber actors. And right now, as our nation is in a period of transition, we need to make sure that nothing is lost in the handoff between administrations. My team needs a clear picture of our force posture around the world and of our operations to deter our enemies. We need full visibility into the budget planning underway at the Defense Department and other agencies in order to avoid any window of confusion or catch-up that our adversaries may try to exploit. But , as I said at the beginning , we have encountered roadblocks from the political leadership at the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget. Right now, we just aren't getting all the information that we need from the outgoing administration in key national security areas. It's nothing short of irresponsible. Finally, we spoke about the day-one challenges that we will need to address immediately, drawing on the skill sets of the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We were briefed on the steps needed to clean up the humanitarian disaster that the Trump Administration has systematically created on our southern border. We will institute a humane and orderly response. That means rebuilding the capacity we need to safely and quickly process asylum seekers without creating a near-term crisis in the midst of a deadly pandemic. These are hard issues. And the current administration has made them much harder by working to erode our capacity. It's going to take time to rebuild it. And we're going to work purposefully and diligently to responsibly roll back Trump's restrictions starting on day one. But it's not as simple as throwing a switch to turn everything back on , especially amid a pandemic. We will have to have a process to ensure everyone's health and safety, including the safety of asylum seekers hoping for a new start in the United States free from violence and persecution. Of course, an essential part of this will be managing the safe, equitable, and efficient distribution of vaccines to as many Americans as possible , as quickly as possible. FEMA has an enormous part to play in this, and we heard from the former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate today. We want to make sure that our administration is poised to make full use of FEMA's domestic reach and capacity in managing our COVID response. Finally, from every briefer, I was heartened to also hear about the incredible strengthwe will be inheriting , the career professionals working across these agencies. They never stop doing their jobs and continue to serve our country day in and day out to keep their fellow Americans safe, just as they have always done. These agencies are filled with patriots who have earned our respect, and who should never be treated as a political football. I'm looking forward to the honor of working with them again, to asking for their advice and inputs to help shape the best possible policies for all Americans. And I want to thank the incredible folks who have served on all the Agency Review Teams as part of this transition. They've dedicated their time, energy, and vital expertise to help ensure Vice President-elect Harris and I are ready to hit the ground running. As we look forward to the start of a new year, fresh with hope and the possibilities of better days to come, but clear-eyed about the challenges that will not disappear overnight, I want to reiterate my message to the American people: We've overcome incredible challenges as a nation. And we will do so again. We'll do it by coming together. By uniting after a year of pain and loss to heal, to rebuild, and to reclaim America's place in the world. This is the work that lies ahead of us, and I know we are up to the task. We will champion liberty and democracy once more. We will reclaim our credibility to lead the free world. And we will, once again, lead not just by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1492274\/national-security-agency-review-teams-briefing-remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"National Security","Source":null,"Location":"Wilmington, DE","Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/national-security-agency-review-teams-briefing-remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware\/","CleanText":"Good afternoon.

Vice President-elect Harris and I just received a briefing on COVID-19 by our team of experts. As we end one of the most difficult years as a nation, I am optimistic about the future. The vaccines that have been discovered and developed give us enormous hope. Our economy is poised to come back, and come alive. And I can see a return to normalcy in the next year. I also see the incredible opportunities for our nation in the years ahead in job creation, in clean energy, racial equality, and so much more. But I need to be honest.

So, we need to steel our spines for what's ahead. We need to follow even more closely the recommendations to slow the spread of the virus. And each of us needs to do what we can to protect ourselves, our families, and our fellow Americans. We are going to get through this. Brighter days are coming. But it's going to take all the grit and determination we have as Americans to get it done. So today, I want to clear about five things every American should know about our efforts to contain COVID-19 and where the vaccine stands today. First , things will get worse before they get better. In September, we passed the grim milestone of 200,000 deaths. At the time, I warned that we'd hit 400,000 deaths before the end of the Trump Administration in January. Critics said I was being too alarmist and negative. But as I've said all along, I will tell it like it is when it comes to COVID. And the reality is, it looks like we'll hit that grim milestone. We just crossed 330,000 deaths. We're averaging a daily death rate of nearly 2,200 people , which means we will lose tens of thousands of more lives in the months to come. Hospitals are being stretched beyond capacity. And that's data before we see the impact of cases coming from the holidays. People getting infected today don't show up in case counts for weeks, and those who perish from the disease die weeks after exposure. So we have to anticipate that infections over the holidays will produce soaring case counts in January and a soaring death toll into February. Turning this around will take time. And we might not see improvement until well into March, as it will take time for our COVID response plan to begin to produce visible progress. Second, the Trump administration's plan to distribute vaccines is falling behind, far behind. We are grateful to the companies, doctors, scientists, researchers, and clinical trial participants, and Operation Warp Speed for developing the vaccines quickly. But as I long feared and warned, the effort to distribute and administer the vaccine is not progressing as it should. A few weeks ago the Trump Administration suggested that 20 million Americans could be vaccinated by the end of December. With only a few days left in December, we have only vaccinated a few million so far. At the pace the vaccination program is moving now, it would take years, not months, to vaccinate the American people. Which brings me to the third thing every American should know: the Biden-Harris Administration will spare no effort to make sure people are getting vaccinated. I've laid out three challenges in our first 100 days. One of them is ensuring that 100 million shots have been administered by the end of our first 100 days. If Congress provides the funding, we would be able to meet this incredible goal. It would take ramping up five to six times the current pace to 1 million shots a day. But even with that improvement, even if we boost the speed of vaccinations to 1 million shots a day, it will still take months to have the majority of the country vaccinated. I have directed my team to prepare a much more aggressive effort , with more federal involvement and leadership to get things back on track. We will find ways to boost the pace of vaccinations. But as Dr. Fauci and others have stated these past few days, this will all take more time than anyone would like , and more time than the promises from the Trump administration has suggested. This will be the greatest operational challenge we have ever faced as a nation. We will get it done. But it's going to take a vast new effort that is not yet underway. And that gets to the fourth thing you should know: I will move Heaven and Earth to get us going in the right direction. I will use my power under the Defense Production Act to order private industry to accelerate the making of materials needed for the vaccine. Vice President-elect Harris and I have been speaking with county officials, mayors, and governors of both parties to speed up the distribution of the vaccine across the nation. We are planning a whole-of-government effort. We will work to set-up vaccination sites and send mobile units to hard-to-reach communities. We also know there is vaccine hesitancy in many communities, especially in Black, Latino, and Native American communities who have not always been treated with the dignity and honesty they deserve by the federal government and the scientific community throughout our history. That's why we will launch a massive public education campaign to increase vaccine acceptance. We will do everything we can to show the vaccines are safe and critically important for one's own health and that of their family and community. That means we will also make sure the vaccine is distributed equitably, so every person who wants the vaccine can get it no matter the color of their skin or where they live. And we're going to ensure vaccinations are free of charge. Fifth , while the pandemic rages on and as we increase the supply, distribution, and administration of the vaccine, we must remain vigilant. As part of our 100-day challenge, I'll be asking the American people to wear a mask for the first 100 days of my administration. Not as a political statement, but as a patriotic duty. Our Administration will require masks where we can for federal workers, in federal facilities, and on interstate travel like planes and trains. And we've been working directly with county officials, mayors, and governors to implement mask mandates in their towns, cities, and states. Masking has been a divisive issue in this country. But COVID is a killer in red states and blue states alike. So , I encourage all of you , wear a mask. Encourage your family and friends to do the same. It's one of the easiest things we can do that will make a huge difference to save lives. Another 100-day challenge is opening most of our K-8 schools by the end of our first 100 days in the spring. But we can only do that if Congress provides the necessary funding so we can get schools, districts, communities, and states the resources they need for so many things that aren't in their already tight budgets. They need funding for testing to help reopen schools. More funding for transportation so students can maintain social distancing on buses. They need it for school buildings, for additional cleaning services, protective equipment, and ventilation systems. This will require an additional tens of billions of dollars to get it done. And Congress also needs to fund and provide more protective equipment for frontline health care workers who are still reusing masks and gowns. And we need to scale up testing so anyone who needs one can get one. After 10 months of the pandemic, we still don't have enough testing. That's a travesty. All of this , vaccinations, testing, protective gear , will require more funding from Congress, more than was just approved. That is why I will propose a COVID action package early next year and challenge Congress to act on it quickly. My ability to change the direction of the pandemic starts in three weeks. But with thousands dying every day between now and then, let me conclude by discussing what needs to happen now. I congratulate the bipartisan majority on passing and President Trump on signing the COVID relief bill. It is a step in the right direction. It will help people in need. It will pay for some, but far from all of what we need to fix the COVID response. It's a down payment. But now, with that done , I hope that the President will also clearly and unambiguously promote mask wearing. I give former Governor Chris Christie credit. He and I disagree on most things. But I'm thankful he's now encouraging people to do the right thing and wear a mask for themselves, their loved ones, and their country. I hope President Trump listens to him. He can do it, too. It would make a huge difference. And I hope that the President will clearly and unambiguously urge all Americans to take the vaccine once it's available. I took it to instill public confidence in the vaccine. Vice President-elect Harris took hers today to do the same. When his doctors recommend it, President Trump should take it and instill that same degree of confidence. And let me also say this to the American people: we can save 60,000-100,000 lives in the weeks and months ahead if we step up together. Wear a mask. Stay socially distanced. Wash our hands. Avoid large indoor gatherings. I know that these are often not easy asks. You're already making tremendous sacrifices every single day. It's hard on your lives, on your livelihoods, and on your kids and families. It's not small what's being asked of you. But we are in it together. And the actions we take now will help us contain the pandemic and get us back to our lives and loved ones. So, to the American people, I know there's a lot that we have to do. But I want you to know there's also so much we can do. We are the United States of America. We've been through hard times before as a nation, and we'll come through this as well. I promise you. We will. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1492302\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-after-a-covid-19-briefing-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Health and Health Care Education","Source":null,"Location":"Wilmington, DE","Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-after-a-covid-19-briefing-in-wilmington-delaware\/","CleanText":"Good afternoon. Vice President-elect Harris and I just received a briefing on COVID-19 by our team of experts. As we end one of the most difficult years as a nation, I am optimistic about the future.

Hello, Georgia! It is great to be back! Let's hear it for Allie for that introduction and the great line-up of entertainers! And let's hear it for Stacey Abrams! No one in America has done more for the right to vote. Stacey, you've changed Georgia and you've changed America. Thank you. Let's also hear it for your next Public Service Commissioner Daniel Blackman! And one of the best mayors in America, your mayor and my good friend Keisha Lance Bottoms. And let's hear it for your next United States Senators Jon Ossoff and Reverend Warnock. They are talented, principled, and qualified. Honorable and decent. They are bending the arc of history towards justice and hope and progress. Folks, this is it. It's a New Year and tomorrow can be a new day for Georgia and America. First, let me start by thanking you for electing me and Kamala Harris as President and Vice President. You voted in record numbers in November. Your voices were heard. Your votes were counted. The will of the people prevailed and we won this state. Now we need you to vote in record numbers again. To make your voice heard again. To change Georgia again. To change America again. Georgia , the whole nation is looking to you to lead us forward. The power is literally in your hands. One state can chart the course not just for the next four years but for a generation. By electing Jon and Reverend Warnock, you can make an immediate difference in your own lives and the lives of people all across this country. Because their election will put an end to the block in Washington on the $2,000 in stimulus checks and that money will be going out the door. Think about what that will mean in your lives. Putting food on the table. Paying the rent. Paying the mortgage. Paying down the credit card. Paying the cell phone bill, the gas bill, the electric bill. Just look around. Millions of people in this country are out of work through no fault of their own. Struggling. Fearful. Giving up hope. Look at the lines at the food banks. They stretch for hours and hours. And they're getting longer. Families. Children. People who have worked their whole lives and have never asked for a thing except a fighting chance. Now they're now lining up for food in America. This debate over $2,000 isn't some abstract debate in Washington. This is about real lives. Your lives. The lives of good, hard-working Americans. And if you're like millions of Americans all over this country, you need the money. You need the help. And you need it now. Georgia, there is no one in America with more power to make it happen than you, the citizens of Georgia. If you send Jon and the Reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks are going out the door, restoring hope and decency and honor to so many people struggling right now. If you send Senators Perdue and Loeffler back to Washington, those checks will never get there. It's just that simple. The power is literally in your hands. By electing Jon and the Reverend, you can break the gridlock that has gripped Washington and this nation. With their votes in the Senate, we'll be able to make the progress we need to make on jobs and health care and justice and the environment and so many other things. By electing Jon and the Reverend, you'll be voting to get the states the resources they need to get the vaccines distributed. I've said it before. Getting America vaccinated will be one of the most difficult operational challenges this nation has ever faced. This Administration has gotten us off to a God-awful start. The states need more money to do the job. And they need a Federal Government that will work with them, not attack them or leave them hanging. It's going to be tough to get this done, but we have to do it. People's lives depend on it. Our economy depends on it. And we will get it done. By electing Jon and the Reverend, you'll be voting to get the state and local governments the money they need to keep their cops and firefighters and teachers and local responders, keeping them on the job, protecting you, and looking out for you and your children States have been struggling through this pandemic. They need the help. And by electing Jon and the Reverend, you'll be sending a powerful message to the Congress and the country: it's time for this nation to come together. To work together. To unite. To put the anger and the division and the divisive politics of the past behind us. And here's one more thing , voting for Jon and the Reverend won't just be good for America. It will be good for Georgia, and here's why. If you vote for Jon and Raphael you will be getting two Senators who will fight for you, who will put Georgia first, who will put you first. You don't have that now. You now have two Senators who think it's more important to reward wealth than hard work in the tax system. You have two Senators who think they work for Donald Trump, not you. You have two Senators who think their loyalty is to Donald Trump, not Georgia. You have two Senators who think they've sworn an oath of office to Donald Trump, not the United States Constitution. Well, let me tell you something. I was elected seven times to the United States Senate from Delaware. Not once did I take an oath to any President or anyone else. I took an oath to the United States Constitution. As president, I don't believe your United States Senators work for me. I believe they work for the people of Georgia. That's why I'm not asking your Senators to be loyal to me. I believe they should be loyal to you, to Georgia, and to the United States Constitution. And if you vote for Jon and the Reverend , that's what you will get. They won't put a president or party first. And they sure won't put themselves first. They know public service is about you. It isn't about enriching themselves. It's about making people's lives better. It's about giving people a chance, just an even shot. It's time we start rewarding work, not just wealth in this country. And if you listen to Jon and the Reverend, that's what they've been saying and that's what they've been campaigning on. On dealing with COVID. On revitalizing our economy. On health care. On voting rights. On criminal justice. On racial justice. On climate change. On the things that matter and that will make a difference in your lives. Georgia , as dark as these days of winter seem, I am still more optimistic about the future of this country than I have been my entire life. And Jon and Raphael share that optimism. Jon saw first-hand the power of believing in the promise of America even in our darkest moments from my old friend and yours , John Lewis. Reverend Warnock sees the power of faith to overcome the toughest trials that life can throw at us. He believes like I do in the quote by the philosopher Kierkegaard, who said, \"Faith sees best in the dark\". And I know they share with me a deep faith in the people of this country. A faith that enables us to overcome adversity, to lift each other up, to be a beacon of light for one another and to the world. That's who we are, and we should never give that up. I've said it many times, and I'll say it again here: There is nothing, nothing this country can't do if we do it together. I know these campaigns can be exhausting. You've put in the hard work over the last few years to get to this moment. It's been intense and nonstop. But I'm asking you to give everything you've got for one more day. One more day. And you can change America. So if you haven't voted, vote. And if you've already voted, then I'm asking for just one more day of making calls and safely knocking on doors. Go to IWillVote.com\/GA to find your polling location. Just like you did in November, vote. Vote for both Jon and the Reverend. In America, as our opposition friends are finding out, all power flows from the people. That is our history. That is our law. That is our Constitution. That is democracy. Politicians cannot, assert, take, or seize power. Power has to be given, granted , by the American people. We can never give that up. It is always the will of the people that must prevail. So today, tomorrow, vote , make sure your voice is heard. Do it for yourselves. Your family. Your children. Your state. Your country. Do it for all those who have given so much to secure that right. Do it for the country you love. And the future you want to build. Do it for all those around the world who aspire to be like us to be a free, democratic people. That power is in your hands. Jon and Reverend Warnock are counting on you. So is Kamala. So am I. And so is America. We are a nation built on honor. Decency. Dignity. Respect. America is, and must continue to be a beacon of light, liberty, democracy, and unity. That's who we are. This is the United States of America. Vote, vote, vote. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1492349\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-at-georgia-senate-drive-in-rally-in-atlanta-georgia&speechType=1","Summary":"Elections","Source":null,"Location":"Atlanta, GA","Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/uncategorized\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-at-georgia-senate-drive-in-rally-in-atlanta-georgia%f0%9f%a5%b2\/","CleanText":"Hello, Atlanta! Hello, Georgia! It is great to be back! Let's hear it for Allie for that introduction and the great line-up of entertainers! And let's hear it for Stacey Abrams! No one in America has done more for the right to vote. Stacey, you've changed Georgia and you've changed America. Thank you. Let's also hear it for your next Public Service Commissioner Daniel Blackman! And one of the best mayors in America, your mayor and my good friend Keisha Lance Bottoms. And let's hear it for your next United States Senators Jon Ossoff and Reverend Warnock. They are talented, principled, and qualified. Honorable and decent. They are bending the arc of history towards justice and hope and progress. Folks, this is it. It's a New Year and tomorrow can be a new day for Georgia and America. First, let me start by thanking you for electing me and Kamala Harris as President and Vice President. You voted in record numbers in November. Your voices were heard. Your votes were counted. The will of the people prevailed and we won this state. Now we need you to vote in record numbers again. To make your voice heard again. To change Georgia again. To change America again. Georgia , the whole nation is looking to you to lead us forward. The power is literally in your hands. One state can chart the course not just for the next four years but for a generation. By electing Jon and Reverend Warnock, you can make an immediate difference in your own lives and the lives of people all across this country. Because their election will put an end to the block in Washington on the $2,000 in stimulus checks and that money will be going out the door. Think about what that will mean in your lives. Putting food on the table. Paying the rent. Paying the mortgage. Paying down the credit card. Paying the cell phone bill, the gas bill, the electric bill. Just look around. Millions of people in this country are out of work through no fault of their own. Struggling. Fearful. Giving up hope. Look at the lines at the food banks. They stretch for hours and hours. And they're getting longer. Families. Children. People who have worked their whole lives and have never asked for a thing except a fighting chance. Now they're now lining up for food in America. This debate over $2,000 isn't some abstract debate in Washington. This is about real lives. Your lives. The lives of good, hard-working Americans. And if you're like millions of Americans all over this country, you need the money. You need the help. And you need it now. Georgia, there is no one in America with more power to make it happen than you, the citizens of Georgia. If you send Jon and the Reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks are going out the door, restoring hope and decency and honor to so many people struggling right now. If you send Senators Perdue and Loeffler back to Washington, those checks will never get there. It's just that simple. The power is literally in your hands. By electing Jon and the Reverend, you can break the gridlock that has gripped Washington and this nation. With their votes in the Senate, we'll be able to make the progress we need to make on jobs and health care and justice and the environment and so many other things. By electing Jon and the Reverend, you'll be voting to get the states the resources they need to get the vaccines distributed. I've said it before. Getting America vaccinated will be one of the most difficult operational challenges this nation has ever faced. This Administration has gotten us off to a God-awful start. The states need more money to do the job. And they need a Federal Government that will work with them, not attack them or leave them hanging. It's going to be tough to get this done, but we have to do it. People's lives depend on it. Our economy depends on it. And we will get it done. By electing Jon and the Reverend, you'll be voting to get the state and local governments the money they need to keep their cops and firefighters and teachers and local responders, keeping them on the job, protecting you, and looking out for you and your children States have been struggling through this pandemic. They need the help. And by electing Jon and the Reverend, you'll be sending a powerful message to the Congress and the country: it's time for this nation to come together. To work together. To unite. To put the anger and the division and the divisive politics of the past behind us. And here's one more thing , voting for Jon and the Reverend won't just be good for America. It will be good for Georgia, and here's why. If you vote for Jon and Raphael you will be getting two Senators who will fight for you, who will put Georgia first, who will put you first. You don't have that now. You now have two Senators who think it's more important to reward wealth than hard work in the tax system. You have two Senators who think they work for Donald Trump, not you. You have two Senators who think their loyalty is to Donald Trump, not Georgia. You have two Senators who think they've sworn an oath of office to Donald Trump, not the United States Constitution. Well, let me tell you something. I was elected seven times to the United States Senate from Delaware. Not once did I take an oath to any President or anyone else. I took an oath to the United States Constitution. As president, I don't believe your United States Senators work for me. I believe they work for the people of Georgia. That's why I'm not asking your Senators to be loyal to me. I believe they should be loyal to you, to Georgia, and to the United States Constitution. And if you vote for Jon and the Reverend , that's what you will get. They won't put a president or party first. And they sure won't put themselves first. They know public service is about you. It isn't about enriching themselves. It's about making people's lives better. It's about giving people a chance, just an even shot. It's time we start rewarding work, not just wealth in this country. And if you listen to Jon and the Reverend, that's what they've been saying and that's what they've been campaigning on. On dealing with COVID. On revitalizing our economy. On health care. On voting rights. On criminal justice. On racial justice. On climate change. On the things that matter and that will make a difference in your lives. Georgia , as dark as these days of winter seem, I am still more optimistic about the future of this country than I have been my entire life. And Jon and Raphael share that optimism. Jon saw first-hand the power of believing in the promise of America even in our darkest moments from my old friend and yours , John Lewis. Reverend Warnock sees the power of faith to overcome the toughest trials that life can throw at us. He believes like I do in the quote by the philosopher Kierkegaard, who said, 'Faith sees best in the dark'. And I know they share with me a deep faith in the people of this country. A faith that enables us to overcome adversity, to lift each other up, to be a beacon of light for one another and to the world. That's who we are, and we should never give that up. I've said it many times, and I'll say it again here: There is nothing, nothing this country can't do if we do it together. I know these campaigns can be exhausting. You've put in the hard work over the last few years to get to this moment. It's been intense and nonstop. But I'm asking you to give everything you've got for one more day. One more day. And you can change America. So if you haven't voted, vote. And if you've already voted, then I'm asking for just one more day of making calls and safely knocking on doors. Go to to find your polling location. Just like you did in November, vote. Vote for both Jon and the Reverend. In America, as our opposition friends are finding out, all power flows from the people. That is our history. That is our law. That is our Constitution. That is democracy. Politicians cannot, assert, take, or seize power. Power has to be given, granted , by the American people. We can never give that up. It is always the will of the people that must prevail. So today, tomorrow, vote , make sure your voice is heard. Do it for yourselves. Your family. Your children. Your state. Your country. Do it for all those who have given so much to secure that right. Do it for the country you love. And the future you want to build. Do it for all those around the world who aspire to be like us to be a free, democratic people. That power is in your hands. Jon and Reverend Warnock are counting on you. So is Kamala. So am I. And so is America. We are a nation built on honor. Decency. Dignity. Respect. America is, and must continue to be a beacon of light, liberty, democracy, and unity. That's who we are. This is the United States of America. Vote, vote, vote. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops."}

Let me be very clear: The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect the true America. This is not who we are. What we are seeing is a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness.

You've heard me say this in different contexts: the words of a President matter, no matter how good or bad that president is. At their best, the words of a president can inspire. At their worst, they can incite. Therefore, I call on President Trump to go on national television, now, to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege. To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices, and to threaten the safety of duly elected officials is not protest. It is insurrection. The world is watching , and like so many other Americans, I am shocked and saddened that our nation, so long a beacon of light, hope, and democracy has come to such a dark moment.

For nearly two and a half centuries, we the people, in search of a more perfect union, have kept our eyes on that common good. America is so much better than what we're seeing today. Watching the scenes from the Capitol, I was reminded of Abraham Lincoln's words in an annual message to the Congress whose work has today been interrupted by chaos. President Lincoln said: \"We shall nobly save or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth .The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just , a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless.\" Our way is plain here, too. It is the way of democracy, of lawfulness, and of honor , respect for each other, and for our nation. Notwithstanding what we've seen today, I remain optimistic about the incredible opportunities. There has never been anything we can't do when we do it together. And this God-awful display today is bringing home to every Republican, Democrat, and Independent in the nation that we must step up.

I also congratulate the twin powers of Georgia, Stacey Abrams and Keisha Lance Bottoms, who have laid the difficult groundwork necessary to encourage turnout and protect the vote over these last years.

An unprecedented assault on our democracy. An assault on the citadel of liberty, the United States Capitol itself. An assault on the rule of law. An assault on the most sacred of American undertakings: ratifying the will of the people in choosing the leadership of their government. We grieve the loss of life. We grieve the desecration of the people's house. But what we witnessed yesterday was not dissent. It was disorder. It was not protest. It was chaos. They weren't protestors. Don't dare call them protestors. They were rioters, a mob. Insurrectionists. Domestic terrorists. It's that basic and that simple. And I wish we could say we couldn't see it coming. But that isn't true. We could. For the past four years we've had a president who has made his contempt for our democracy, our Constitution, and the rule of law clear in everything he has done. He has unleashed an all-out assault on the institutions of our democracy. And yesterday was but the culmination of that unrelenting attack. He has attacked the free press who dared to question his power, repeatedly calling the free press the enemy of the people. Language that has long been used by autocrats and dictators all over the world to hold on to power. Language that is being used now by autocrats and dictators across the world, only this time with the imprimatur of the outgoing President of the United States. He has attacked our intelligence services who dared to tell the American people the truth about the efforts of a foreign power to elect him four years ago, choosing instead to believe the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of those who had sworn their allegiance to this nation , many of whom had risked their lives in service in this nation. He deployed the United States military, tear-gassing peaceful protestors in the pursuit of a photo opportunity in service of his reelection. Even holding the Bible upside down. An action that led to an apology from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the outspoken denunciation of the use of the military for domestic political purposes from scores of former military leaders and Secretaries of Defense. He thought he could stack the courts with friendly judges who would support him no matter what. He went so far as to say he needed nine justices on the Supreme Court because he thought the election would end up in the Supreme Court and they would hand him the election. And he was stunned, truly stunned, when the judges he appointed didn't do his bidding, but instead acted with integrity, followed the Constitution, and upheld the rule of law. Not just once or twice, or three times , but over 60 times. In more than 60 cases, in state after state after state, and then at the Supreme Court judges, including people he considered quote \"his\" judges, \"Trump judges\" , the courts looked at the allegations Trump was making and determined they were without merit. Nothing was judged to put the election in question or doubt. You want to understand the importance of democratic institutions in this country? Take a look at the judiciary in this nation. Take a look at the pressure it was just subjected to by the sitting president of the United States. At every level, it rose to the moment during this election. Did its job. Acted with complete fairness and impartiality. With complete honor and integrity. When history looks back at the moment we just passed through, it will say our democracy survived in no small part because of the men and women who represent the independent judiciary in this nation. We owe them a deep, deep debt of gratitude. And then there is his attack on the Department of Justice. Treating the Attorney General as his personal lawyer and the department as his personal law firm. Through it all, we would hear the same thing from this president , my generals, my judges, my Attorney General. And then yesterday. The culmination of the attack on our institutions of democracy. This time the Congress itself. Inciting a mob to attack the Capitol, to threaten the elected Representatives of the people of this nation and even the Vice President, to stop the United States Congress from ratifying the will of the people in a just-completed free and fair election. Trying to use a mob to silence the voices of nearly 160 million Americans who summoned the courage in the face of a pandemic that threatened their health and their lives to cast their sacred ballot. I made it clear from the moment I entered this race what I believed was at stake nothing less than who we are as a nation, what we stand for, and what we believe, what we will be. And at the center of that belief is one of the oldest principles this nation has long held , we are a government of laws , not people. I said it many times in the campaign. Our democratic institutions are not relics of another age. They are what set this nation apart. They are the guardrails of our democracy. They are why no president is a king. No Congress is the House of Lords. The judiciary doesn't serve the will of the president, or exist to protect him or her. We have three co-equal branches of government. Our president is not above the law. Justice serves the people , it doesn't protect the powerful. And it is blind. What we saw yesterday in plain view was another violation of a fundamental tenet of this nation. Not only did we see a failure to protect one of the three branches of our government, we also saw a clear failure to carry out equal justice. No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protestors yesterday that they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the mob that stormed the Capitol. We all know that's true. And that is totally unacceptable. And the American people saw it in plain view and I hope it sensitized them to what we have to do. Not many people know it, but the reason the Department of Justice was formed in 1870 was to enforce the Civil Rights Amendments that grew out of the Civil War , the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments. To stand up to the Klan. To take on domestic terrorism. This original spirit must once again guide and animate its work. So as we stand here today, we do so in the wake of yesterday's events. Events that could not more vividly demonstrate some of the most important work we have to do in this nation. Committing ourselves to the rule of law in this nation. Invigorating our democratic institutions. Carrying out equal justice under the law in America. There is no more important place for us to do this work than at the Department of Justice. And there are no more important people to carry out this work than the people I am announcing today. More than anything, we need to restore the honor, the integrity, and the independence of the Department of Justice in this nation. I want it to be clear to those who lead the department and those who serve there. You don't work for me. Your loyalty isn't to me. It is to the law. To the Constitution. To the people of this nation. To guarantee justice. For Attorney General of the United States, I nominate Judge Merrick Garland. One of the most respected jurists of our time. Brilliant yet humble. Distinguished yet modest. Full of character and decency. Supreme Court clerk. Served in the Justice Department during the Carter, Bush 41, and Clinton Administrations, where he embraced the Department's core values of independence and integrity. As federal prosecutor he took on terrorism and corruption and violent crime always with utmost professionalism and duty to the oath he swore. Nominated by President Clinton to be a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the second most powerful court in America. Throughout such a long and distinguished career, he has earned the praise and admiration of members of the bar and bench, and politicians of both parties. And despite his busy schedule and prestigious position, he still makes time to volunteer, regularly tutoring students in Northeast D.C. as he has for more than 20 years. This is about character. It is no surprise why President Obama nominated Judge Garland to the Supreme Court. He embodies honor, decency, integrity , fidelity to the rule of law and judicial independence. It's those same traits he will now bring as the Attorney General of the United States, not as the personal attorney to the President. He will restore trust in the rule of law and equal justice under law. I fully expect that he will receive a fair hearing and swift confirmation. And once he is confirmed, I will move promptly to nominate his replacement on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and I expect that the distinguished nominee will receive a prompt and fair hearing as well. For Deputy Attorney General I nominate Lisa Monaco. A fifteen-year veteran of the Department of Justice, Lisa knows the department inside and out. She is a definition of what a public servant should be , decent, trusted, and honorable. A top-flight prosecutor who took on public corruption, corporate fraud, and violent crime. Chief of Staff to the Director of the FBI. The first woman ever to be confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for National Security, where she elevated cybersecurity to a top priority , which is even more consequential today. And at the White House, she was the top homeland security and counterterrorism advisor to President Obama and me. She coordinated our fight against Al-Qaeda and ISIL. She helped lead our response to the Ebola crisis. And when the bombs went off at the finish line on Patriot's Day in Boston, her hometown , she coordinated the federal government's response with local and state law enforcement to get to the bottom of this horrible tragedy. I know she will help restore the integrity and independence of the Department of Justice that she reveres. For Associate Attorney General, the number 3 job at the Department , I nominate Vanita Gupta. One of the most respected civil rights lawyers in America. Started her career at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Then on to the ACLU. And then to the Justice Department during the Obama-Biden Administration where she led the Civil Rights Division. At every step, with every case, she has fought for greater equity and to right the wrongs in our justice system where they existed. And she has done so by bringing people together, earning praise from across the ideological spectrum for her approach to solving some of the thorniest problems we face. During the Obama-Biden Administration, Vanita was put in charge of investigating abuse of power in police departments in Ferguson, Missouri, and other communities torn apart by acts of violence and racial injustice. She helped institute common-sense police reforms to build greater equity, safety, and trust. She was commended for her work both by law enforcement and by those advocating for changes in the criminal justice system. That is a rare achievement , and it speaks volumes about her capacity to unite people in common purpose, which this is all about. Born in Philadelphia and a proud daughter of immigrants from India, if confirmed, Vanita will be the first woman of color to serve as Associate Attorney General. I am grateful that Vanita is leaving her current job leading one of the premier civil rights organizations in the world to answer the call to serve once again and ensure our justice system is even more fair and equitable. For Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, I nominate Kristen Clarke, who has also spent her career advocating for greater equity in the justice system. A daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Kristen is also one of the most distinguished civil rights attorneys in America. A proud native of Brooklyn, New York she began her legal career in the very same office she is now nominated to lead. Her previous tenure with the Justice Department saw her take on some of the most complex civil rights cases , from voting rights and redistricting challenges to prosecuting hate crimes and human trafficking. She has earned accolades throughout her career , including as the head of the Civil Rights Bureau for her home state of New York, where she led the charge to end the school-to-prison pipeline and root out discrimination in housing and law enforcement. She currently leads one of the nation's top civil rights organizations, where she promotes greater equity in voting rights, in our education system, our housing system, our justice system, and so much more. Now, she will return full circle to pursue that vital work where her career began. The Civil Rights Division represents the moral center of the Department of Justice, and the heart of that fundamental American ideal, that we are created equal and deserve to be treated equally. I am honored she accepted the call to return to make real that promise for all Americans. To each of you, thank you for your service and that of your families. And to the American people, this is the team that will restore your trust and faith in our institutions of democracy. One of the reasons I ran for president was when I saw those people coming out of the fields in Charlottesville, shouting hate, a young woman killed, and when asked, the President of the United States said there are good people on both sides. That's why I ran. There is no more important or heartfeld effort on my part than restoring the independence and integrity of our Justice Department. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops and those who have sworn to protect the American people I'll turn it over to the team, starting with the next Attorney General of the United States, Judge Merrick Garland.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1493224\/remarks-announcing-department-of-justice-leadership-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"National Security Executive Branch Criminal Justice","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-announcing-department-of-justice-leadership-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware\/","CleanText":"Yesterday was one of the darkest days in the history of our nation. An unprecedented assault on our democracy. An assault on the citadel of liberty, the United States Capitol itself. An assault on the rule of law. An assault on the most sacred of American undertakings: ratifying the will of the people in choosing the leadership of their government. We grieve the loss of life. We grieve the desecration of the people's house. But what we witnessed yesterday was not dissent. It was disorder. It was not protest. It was chaos. They weren't protestors. Don't dare call them protestors. They were rioters, a mob. Insurrectionists. Domestic terrorists. It's that basic and that simple. And I wish we could say we couldn't see it coming. But that isn't true. We could. For the past four years we've had a president who has made his contempt for our democracy, our Constitution, and the rule of law clear in everything he has done. He has unleashed an all-out assault on the institutions of our democracy. And yesterday was but the culmination of that unrelenting attack. He has attacked the free press who dared to question his power, repeatedly calling the free press the enemy of the people. Language that has long been used by autocrats and dictators all over the world to hold on to power. Language that is being used now by autocrats and dictators across the world, only this time with the imprimatur of the outgoing President of the United States. He has attacked our intelligence services who dared to tell the American people the truth about the efforts of a foreign power to elect him four years ago, choosing instead to believe the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of those who had sworn their allegiance to this nation , many of whom had risked their lives in service in this nation. He deployed the United States military, tear-gassing peaceful protestors in the pursuit of a photo opportunity in service of his reelection. Even holding the Bible upside down. An action that led to an apology from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the outspoken denunciation of the use of the military for domestic political purposes from scores of former military leaders and Secretaries of Defense. He thought he could stack the courts with friendly judges who would support him no matter what. He went so far as to say he needed nine justices on the Supreme Court because he thought the election would end up in the Supreme Court and they would hand him the election. And he was stunned, truly stunned, when the judges he appointed didn't do his bidding, but instead acted with integrity, followed the Constitution, and upheld the rule of law. Not just once or twice, or three times , but over 60 times. In more than 60 cases, in state after state after state, and then at the Supreme Court judges, including people he considered quote 'his' judges, 'Trump judges' , the courts looked at the allegations Trump was making and determined they were without merit. Nothing was judged to put the election in question or doubt. You want to understand the importance of democratic institutions in this country? Take a look at the judiciary in this nation. Take a look at the pressure it was just subjected to by the sitting president of the United States. At every level, it rose to the moment during this election. Did its job. Acted with complete fairness and impartiality. With complete honor and integrity. When history looks back at the moment we just passed through, it will say our democracy survived in no small part because of the men and women who represent the independent judiciary in this nation. We owe them a deep, deep debt of gratitude. And then there is his attack on the Department of Justice. Treating the Attorney General as his personal lawyer and the department as his personal law firm. Through it all, we would hear the same thing from this president , my generals, my judges, my Attorney General. And then yesterday. The culmination of the attack on our institutions of democracy. This time the Congress itself. Inciting a mob to attack the Capitol, to threaten the elected Representatives of the people of this nation and even the Vice President, to stop the United States Congress from ratifying the will of the people in a just-completed free and fair election. Trying to use a mob to silence the voices of nearly 160 million Americans who summoned the courage in the face of a pandemic that threatened their health and their lives to cast their sacred ballot. I made it clear from the moment I entered this race what I believed was at stake nothing less than who we are as a nation, what we stand for, and what we believe, what we will be. And at the center of that belief is one of the oldest principles this nation has long held , we are a government of laws , not people. I said it many times in the campaign. Our democratic institutions are not relics of another age. They are what set this nation apart. They are the guardrails of our democracy. They are why no president is a king. No Congress is the House of Lords. The judiciary doesn't serve the will of the president, or exist to protect him or her. We have three co-equal branches of government. Our president is not above the law. Justice serves the people , it doesn't protect the powerful. And it is blind. What we saw yesterday in plain view was another violation of a fundamental tenet of this nation. Not only did we see a failure to protect one of the three branches of our government, we also saw a clear failure to carry out equal justice. No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protestors yesterday that they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the mob that stormed the Capitol. We all know that's true. And that is totally unacceptable. And the American people saw it in plain view and I hope it sensitized them to what we have to do. Not many people know it, but the reason the Department of Justice was formed in 1870 was to enforce the Civil Rights Amendments that grew out of the Civil War , the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments. To stand up to the Klan. To take on domestic terrorism. This original spirit must once again guide and animate its work. So as we stand here today, we do so in the wake of yesterday's events. Events that could not more vividly demonstrate some of the most important work we have to do in this nation. Committing ourselves to the rule of law in this nation. Invigorating our democratic institutions. Carrying out equal justice under the law in America. There is no more important place for us to do this work than at the Department of Justice. And there are no more important people to carry out this work than the people I am announcing today. More than anything, we need to restore the honor, the integrity, and the independence of the Department of Justice in this nation. I want it to be clear to those who lead the department and those who serve there. You don't work for me. Your loyalty isn't to me. It is to the law. To the Constitution. To the people of this nation. To guarantee justice. For Attorney General of the United States, I nominate Judge Merrick Garland. One of the most respected jurists of our time. Brilliant yet humble. Distinguished yet modest. Full of character and decency. Supreme Court clerk. Served in the Justice Department during the Carter, Bush 41, and Clinton Administrations, where he embraced the Department's core values of independence and integrity. As federal prosecutor he took on terrorism and corruption and violent crime always with utmost professionalism and duty to the oath he swore. Nominated by President Clinton to be a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the second most powerful court in America. Throughout such a long and distinguished career, he has earned the praise and admiration of members of the bar and bench, and politicians of both parties. And despite his busy schedule and prestigious position, he still makes time to volunteer, regularly tutoring students in Northeast D.C. as he has for more than 20 years. This is about character. It is no surprise why President Obama nominated Judge Garland to the Supreme Court. He embodies honor, decency, integrity , fidelity to the rule of law and judicial independence. It's those same traits he will now bring as the Attorney General of the United States, not as the personal attorney to the President. He will restore trust in the rule of law and equal justice under law. I fully expect that he will receive a fair hearing and swift confirmation. And once he is confirmed, I will move promptly to nominate his replacement on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and I expect that the distinguished nominee will receive a prompt and fair hearing as well. For Deputy Attorney General I nominate Lisa Monaco. A fifteen-year veteran of the Department of Justice, Lisa knows the department inside and out. She is a definition of what a public servant should be , decent, trusted, and honorable. A top-flight prosecutor who took on public corruption, corporate fraud, and violent crime. Chief of Staff to the Director of the FBI. The first woman ever to be confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for National Security, where she elevated cybersecurity to a top priority , which is even more consequential today. And at the White House, she was the top homeland security and counterterrorism advisor to President Obama and me. She coordinated our fight against Al-Qaeda and ISIL. She helped lead our response to the Ebola crisis. And when the bombs went off at the finish line on Patriot's Day in Boston, her hometown , she coordinated the federal government's response with local and state law enforcement to get to the bottom of this horrible tragedy. I know she will help restore the integrity and independence of the Department of Justice that she reveres. For Associate Attorney General, the number 3 job at the Department , I nominate Vanita Gupta. One of the most respected civil rights lawyers in America. Started her career at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Then on to the ACLU. And then to the Justice Department during the Obama-Biden Administration where she led the Civil Rights Division. At every step, with every case, she has fought for greater equity and to right the wrongs in our justice system where they existed. And she has done so by bringing people together, earning praise from across the ideological spectrum for her approach to solving some of the thorniest problems we face. During the Obama-Biden Administration, Vanita was put in charge of investigating abuse of power in police departments in Ferguson, Missouri, and other communities torn apart by acts of violence and racial injustice. She helped institute common-sense police reforms to build greater equity, safety, and trust. She was commended for her work both by law enforcement and by those advocating for changes in the criminal justice system. That is a rare achievement , and it speaks volumes about her capacity to unite people in common purpose, which this is all about. Born in Philadelphia and a proud daughter of immigrants from India, if confirmed, Vanita will be the first woman of color to serve as Associate Attorney General. I am grateful that Vanita is leaving her current job leading one of the premier civil rights organizations in the world to answer the call to serve once again and ensure our justice system is even more fair and equitable. For Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, I nominate Kristen Clarke, who has also spent her career advocating for greater equity in the justice system. A daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Kristen is also one of the most distinguished civil rights attorneys in America. A proud native of Brooklyn, New York she began her legal career in the very same office she is now nominated to lead. Her previous tenure with the Justice Department saw her take on some of the most complex civil rights cases , from voting rights and redistricting challenges to prosecuting hate crimes and human trafficking. She has earned accolades throughout her career , including as the head of the Civil Rights Bureau for her home state of New York, where she led the charge to end the school-to-prison pipeline and root out discrimination in housing and law enforcement.

Today, I am pleased to announce the latest members of our economic team. And with their announcements, I am proud to announce that we have finished naming our Cabinet. Twenty-four outstanding women and men who will get our country moving again, who will restore trust in our government again, and who are ready to go on Day One. This is a Cabinet that looks like America. That taps into the full range of talents we have in our nation. And a historic Cabinet. This will be the first Cabinet ever that is evenly composed of women and men. It will be the first Cabinet ever with a majority of people of color. It has more than a dozen history-making appointments, including the first woman Treasury Secretary, the first African American Defense Secretary, the first openly gay Cabinet member, the first Native American Cabinet secretary. We are also on track to name a record 50 high-level appointees subject to Senate confirmation before Inauguration Day. More than any President-elect ever. I have done my job. It is my hope and expectation that the Senate will confirm these nominees promptly and fairly. That's especially the case for nominees for Secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury, and Homeland Security who I nominated back in November. Given what our country has been through the last four years and the last few days, and given the threats and risks in this world, they should be confirmed as close to January 20th as possible. There should be no vacancies at State, Defense, Treasury, and Homeland Security. And as we remain in this dark winter of the pandemic, and with an economic crisis that's deepened, we have no time to lose on the entire team. Consider the December jobs report released today. The anxiety and fear of the women and men out there reminds me of when President Obama and I were sworn in during the Great Recession in 2009. This December jobs report shows millions of Americans are still hurting through no fault of their own. We lost 140,000 jobs , the first negative jobs report since the height of the pandemic in the spring. More people have just lost a job while many have been out of work for a long time. The ongoing gap in Black and Latino unemployment remains much too large. And in many ways, the jobs report is a pandemic report. With the pandemic raging, people are losing work and losing hope. The hospitality industry, restaurants and bars, lost more than 372,000 jobs. State and local governments are slashing jobs , 20,000 local educators lost their jobs last month. In the midst of this pandemic, there are millions of people out of work and unable to pay rent or the mortgage. They're waiting in line for hours at a food bank. In the United States of America, people are waiting miles in their cars waiting for a meal. And they're left staring at the ceiling at night, unable to sleep, wondering if they will ever be okay. The bottom line is the jobs report shows we need to provide more immediate relieffor working families and businesses now. Not just to help them get to the other side of this painful crisis, but to avoid the broader economic costs due to long-term unemployment, hunger, homelessness, and businesses failing. And by acting now, the vast majority of leading economists suggest this is what the economy needs. In fact, economic research confirms that with conditions like today's crisis, especially with such low interest rates, taking immediate action, even with deficit financing, will help the economy, reduce scarring in the workforce, increase growth, and reduce our national debt burden. As I've said before, the bipartisan COVID relief package passed in December is an important step, but just a downpayment. Next week, I will be laying out the groundwork for the next COVID economic relief package that meets this critical moment for our economy and country. For example, the vaccines give us hope, but their rollout has been a travesty. This will be the greatest operational challenge we have ever faced, and we're going to need billions of dollars to get the vaccines from a vial and into the arms of millions of Americans. We're also going to need tens of billions of dollars to help reopen our schools safely. State, local, and tribal communities need tens of billions of dollars to keep educators, police officers, firefighters, and other first responders and public health workers on the job. We need more direct relief flowing to families and small businesses, including finishing the job and getting people $2,000 in relief. $600 is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table and keeping the lights on. I also hope that Democratic control of the House and Senate will raise the odds of prompt actionon increasing the minimum wage. I've long said that we need to reward work, not wealth in this country. People in both parties now recognize it's time to raise the minimum wage so hardworking people earn at least $15 an hour. No one who works 40 hours a week in America should still live below the poverty line. They are entitled to a minimum of $15 an hour. A big focus will also be on small businesses and how to correct the current Administration's failures to get relief to Main Street small businesses that are most in need. Mom and pop stores are the backbone of our economy. They are the glue that holds communities together. But today, more than 1 in 4 small businesses are not open. At least 400,000 are closed for good. As of a month ago, a third of Black-owned businesses, more than a fifth of Latino-owned businesses, and more than a quarter of Native American-owned businesses have less than a month of reserves to cover expenses. The previous rounds of economic relief last year helped millions of small businesses stay afloat and keep employees on the payroll. But there were clear problems. Black and Brown-owned small businesses had less access to the relief. Mom and pop shops were often last in line, while big, well-connected businesses jumped in front of the line and got more relief and got it faster. And at every turn, the Trump Administration has undermined accountability for every tax dollar spent, weakening oversight and routinely firing Inspectors General. So it's no surprise that an independent watchdog found that tens of thousands of ineligible companies received relief they shouldn't have, including from fraud and abuse that siphoned off support for the very businesses most in need. The good news is that the relief package passed last month provides additional aid to small businesses and workers. But as I have said from the beginning, we need to make sure that relief and future relief reaches everyone who needs it. These relief dollars will start to flow quickly, potentially while the current Administration is still in office. And they may send out money that we won't have any control over. But for what we do have control over, I want to be clear about my priorities for distributing this emergency aid swiftly and equitably. Our focus will be on the small businesses on Main Street that aren't wealthy and well-connected and that are facing real economic hardships through no fault of their own. Our priority will be on Black, Latino, Asian, and Native American-owned small businesses, and women-owned businesses, finally having equal access to the resources needed to reopen and rebuild. We will make a concerted effort to help small businesses in low-income communities, in big cities, small towns, and rural communities that have faced systemic barriers to relief. Think of the mom and pop owner with a couple of employees who can't just pick up a phone and call a banker, or who doesn't have lawyers and accountants to help them through the complicated rules to know if they even qualify, or who simply didn't know there was even relief available in the first place. And as we saw in this morning's jobs report, restaurants, bars, and the hospitality industryhave been slammed by the virus. We will direct relief to these businesses and others that have been hit hardest. We owe them that support to help them get through the other side of this crisis. And I promise you, we will investigate and prosecute waste and fraud in these programs so that money goes to companies that deserve it and will use it to help their employees and communities. When I implemented the Recovery Act, we invested more than $800 billion to help our economy recover and rebuild with less than two-tenths of one percent of waste, fraud, and abuse. We know how to do this. We know how important predictability and clarity are to small businesses. From day one, our Administration will work to ensure that small businesses and financial institutions in every community understand the rules for these programs, the resources available to them, and where they can turn for technical assistance if they need it. We will have navigators to help guide them through each step of the process until the money they need is in their bank account. And to the lenders participating in these programs, you should move quickly without delay to begin extending relief. But I urge you to not disburse these funds in the same old, inequitable ways. Here's my commitment in return , we will make our expectations of you crystal clear so that you can quickly and equitably deliver relief to the communities you serve, unlike what has been happening during this crisis The bottom line is we are in the midst of the most unequal economic and jobs crisis in modern history. Congress needs to act as quickly as possible on all of the issues I just laid out. That is how we can contain the pandemic and build back better with an economy that works for all Americans. And this is the team that will help get it done. For Secretary of Commerce, I nominate Governor Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island. A daughter of a working-class family who knows what it's like when a parent's factory job is shipped overseas. She never took her parents' sacrifices for granted. Always remembers where she came from. She became a successful entrepreneur who created jobs on Main Street and brought businesses back from the edge. She became a state Treasurer who invested in local communities and took on financial predators. And today, she is one of the most effective and forward-thinking governors in the United States of America , the first woman ever to lead the Ocean State. She's created an innovative loan program that's helped minority-owned and women-owned businesses access the capital they need but wasn't always available to them. She's worked with employers to design skills-training programs so that local workers would be equipped to take on good-paying jobs in their own communities. She has put Rhode Island on a path of achieving 100% renewable energy, and she will be a key player in helping position the United States as the global leader in the 21st Century clean energy economy. And she knows what her fellow governors, Democrats and Republicans alike, are dealing with on the frontlines of the pandemic and economic crises and how we can all partner together as one nation to contain COVID-19 and build back better. I'm honored she is joining the team. For Secretary of Labor, I nominate Mayor Marty Walsh of Boston. Son of Irish immigrants from County Galway. They moved to Boston. Marty was born and raised in Dorchester. I know him. Tough as nails. Diagnosed with cancer at age 7, beat it at age 11. Joined the Laborers Union Local 223 at age 21. Elected to the state legislature. Became union president. Then graduated from college at age 42. He is now in his second term as the successful mayor of an iconic American city, and who always puts working people first. Fighting for a $15 minimum wage and paid family leave. Providing frontline workers with emergency child care and the protective equipment they need. Marty understands like I do that the middle class built this country and unions built the middle class. He's seen how union workers have been holding this country together during this crisis. Health care workers keeping our hospitals safe, clean, and effective. Public service workers fighting against budget shortfalls to keep communities afloat. Port workers, car haulers, warehouse workers, and folks keeping our air and rail systems running. They are literally what's keeping us going. And they deserve a Secretary of Labor who knows how to build their power as workers. Who knows that when I say our future will be made in America, it will be a future built by American workers. A future with historic investments in infrastructure, clean energy, manufacturing, and so much more that will create millions of good-paying union jobs. Marty knows worker power means not just protecting the right to unionize but encouraging unionization and collective bargaining. It means protecting pensions. Ensuring worker safety. Increasing the minimum wage. Ensuring workers are paid for the overtime they earned, like we fought to do in the Obama-Biden Administration, but this Administration weakened. And making sure that we have a trade policy where for every decision we make, unions are at the table, focused on winning good jobs for American workers. This is one of the most important departments to me. I trust Mayor Walsh, and I'm honored he accepted. But I also want to say that I did give serious consideration to nominating my friend Senator Bernie Sanders to this position. I'm confident he could've done a fantastic job. I can think of no more passionate and devoted ally of working people in this country. But after Tuesday's result in Georgia, giving Democrats control of the Senate on a tied vote, Bernie and I agreed that we cannot put control of the Senate at risk on the outcome of a special election in Vermont. He agreed we couldn't take that chance. But we also discussed how we would work together, travel the country, helping Marty, and meet with the working men and women who feel forgotten and left behind in the economy. And we agreed that we will work closely on our shared agenda to increase worker powerand protect the dignity of work for all working people. I thank Bernie for his continued friendship and leadership and I look forward to us working together along with Marty. For Administrator of the Small Business Administration, I nominate Isabel Guzman. She grew up in California, working alongside her father in the small veterinary businesses he built. She developed an early understanding of what small businesses mean to their employees, the neighborhoods they support, and the families whose dreams they represent. She dedicated her career to creating jobs and supporting entrepreneurs as a senior official in the Obama-Biden Small Business Administration. As the Director of California's Office of the Small Business Advocate, she works tirelessly to ensure that everyone with an entrepreneurial spark has a fair and equal shot to get off the ground and succeed. The Biden-Harris Administration will be locked in on helping small businesses recover, rebuild, and remain the engines of our economy. And as head of the SBA, Isabel will be leading that critical mission to not only rescue small businesses in crisis, but to provide the capital to entrepreneurs across the country so they can innovate, create jobs, and help lead us into recovery. I am grateful that she has accepted this call to serve. For Deputy Commerce Secretary, I nominate a good and loyal friend, Don Graves. Don is a longtime trusted advisor. He was there at the Treasury Department during the depths of the Great Recession, helping small businesses weather the storm and stay afloat. When President Obama asked me to lead the effort to get Detroit out of bankruptcy and off its back he said I could take anyone in the Administration. So, I went to the Treasury Department and asked for Don to come over and work on it full-time. It was the best decision we made in that effort. He did a great job working with city and state officials on its road to recovery. It's about the small details like the number of buses and street lights that are needed. He also helped me lead our national strategy to equip our workers with the skills they need for the good-paying jobs of the 21st Century, in health care, IT, clean energy, advanced manufacturing, and more. And he was there to help me launch the National Cancer Moonshot and marshal the full resources of the federal government to help end cancer as we know it. A cancer survivor himself, diagnosed and treated while he was working for me, Don knows about hope and resilience. I'm grateful to him and his wonderful family for answering the call to serve once again. And thanks to all of you and your families for serving. And to the American people , I know times are tough. But I want you to know that we will get through this. Help is on the way. This team knows what it's like. They know what to do. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. I'll now turn it over to the team, starting with the next Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh. After they are done, I will take your questions.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1493337\/remarks-announcing-labor-commerce-and-sba-nominations-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Executive Branch Health and Health Care Economy and Fiscal","Source":null,"Location":"Wilmington, DE","Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-announcing-labor-commerce-and-sba-nominations-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-in-wilmington-delaware\/","CleanText":"Good afternoon.

In fact, economic research confirms that with conditions like today's crisis, especially with such low interest rates, taking immediate action, even with deficit financing, will help the economy, reduce scarring in the workforce, increase growth, and reduce our national debt burden. As I've said before, the bipartisan COVID relief package passed in December is an important step, but just a downpayment. Next week, I will be laying out the groundwork for the next COVID economic relief package that meets this critical moment for our economy and country. For example, the vaccines give us hope, but their rollout has been a travesty. This will be the greatest operational challenge we have ever faced, and we're going to need billions of dollars to get the vaccines from a vial and into the arms of millions of Americans. We're also going to need tens of billions of dollars to help reopen our schools safely. State, local, and tribal communities need tens of billions of dollars to keep educators, police officers, firefighters, and other first responders and public health workers on the job. We need more direct relief flowing to families and small businesses, including finishing the job and getting people $2,000 in relief. $600 is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table and keeping the lights on. I also hope that Democratic control of the House and Senate will raise the odds of prompt actionon increasing the minimum wage. I've long said that we need to reward work, not wealth in this country. People in both parties now recognize it's time to raise the minimum wage so hardworking people earn at least $15 an hour. No one who works 40 hours a week in America should still live below the poverty line. They are entitled to a minimum of $15 an hour. A big focus will also be on small businesses and how to correct the current Administration's failures to get relief to Main Street small businesses that are most in need. Mom and pop stores are the backbone of our economy. They are the glue that holds communities together. But today, more than 1 in 4 small businesses are not open. At least 400,000 are closed for good. As of a month ago, a third of Black-owned businesses, more than a fifth of Latino-owned businesses, and more than a quarter of Native American-owned businesses have less than a month of reserves to cover expenses. The previous rounds of economic relief last year helped millions of small businesses stay afloat and keep employees on the payroll. But there were clear problems. Black and Brown-owned small businesses had less access to the relief. Mom and pop shops were often last in line, while big, well-connected businesses jumped in front of the line and got more relief and got it faster. And at every turn, the Trump Administration has undermined accountability for every tax dollar spent, weakening oversight and routinely firing Inspectors General. So it's no surprise that an independent watchdog found that tens of thousands of ineligible companies received relief they shouldn't have, including from fraud and abuse that siphoned off support for the very businesses most in need. The good news is that the relief package passed last month provides additional aid to small businesses and workers. But as I have said from the beginning, we need to make sure that relief and future relief reaches everyone who needs it. These relief dollars will start to flow quickly, potentially while the current Administration is still in office. And they may send out money that we won't have any control over. But for what we do have control over, I want to be clear about my priorities for distributing this emergency aid swiftly and equitably. Our focus will be on the small businesses on Main Street that aren't wealthy and well-connected and that are facing real economic hardships through no fault of their own. Our priority will be on Black, Latino, Asian, and Native American-owned small businesses, and women-owned businesses, finally having equal access to the resources needed to reopen and rebuild. We will make a concerted effort to help small businesses in low-income communities, in big cities, small towns, and rural communities that have faced systemic barriers to relief. Think of the mom and pop owner with a couple of employees who can't just pick up a phone and call a banker, or who doesn't have lawyers and accountants to help them through the complicated rules to know if they even qualify, or who simply didn't know there was even relief available in the first place. And as we saw in this morning's jobs report, restaurants, bars, and the hospitality industryhave been slammed by the virus. We will direct relief to these businesses and others that have been hit hardest. We owe them that support to help them get through the other side of this crisis. And I promise you, we will investigate and prosecute waste and fraud in these programs so that money goes to companies that deserve it and will use it to help their employees and communities. When I implemented the Recovery Act, we invested more than $800 billion to help our economy recover and rebuild with less than two-tenths of one percent of waste, fraud, and abuse. We know how to do this. We know how important predictability and clarity are to small businesses. From day one, our Administration will work to ensure that small businesses and financial institutions in every community understand the rules for these programs, the resources available to them, and where they can turn for technical assistance if they need it. We will have navigators to help guide them through each step of the process until the money they need is in their bank account. And to the lenders participating in these programs, you should move quickly without delay to begin extending relief. But I urge you to not disburse these funds in the same old, inequitable ways. Here's my commitment in return , we will make our expectations of you crystal clear so that you can quickly and equitably deliver relief to the communities you serve, unlike what has been happening during this crisis The bottom line is we are in the midst of the most unequal economic and jobs crisis in modern history. Congress needs to act as quickly as possible on all of the issues I just laid out. That is how we can contain the pandemic and build back better with an economy that works for all Americans. And this is the team that will help get it done. For Secretary of Commerce, I nominate Governor Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island. A daughter of a working-class family who knows what it's like when a parent's factory job is shipped overseas. She never took her parents' sacrifices for granted. Always remembers where she came from. She became a successful entrepreneur who created jobs on Main Street and brought businesses back from the edge. She became a state Treasurer who invested in local communities and took on financial predators. And today, she is one of the most effective and forward-thinking governors in the United States of America , the first woman ever to lead the Ocean State. She's created an innovative loan program that's helped minority-owned and women-owned businesses access the capital they need but wasn't always available to them. She's worked with employers to design skills-training programs so that local workers would be equipped to take on good-paying jobs in their own communities. She has put Rhode Island on a path of achieving 100% renewable energy, and she will be a key player in helping position the United States as the global leader in the 21st Century clean energy economy. And she knows what her fellow governors, Democrats and Republicans alike, are dealing with on the frontlines of the pandemic and economic crises and how we can all partner together as one nation to contain COVID-19 and build back better. I'm honored she is joining the team. For Secretary of Labor, I nominate Mayor Marty Walsh of Boston. Son of Irish immigrants from County Galway. They moved to Boston. Marty was born and raised in Dorchester. I know him. Tough as nails. Diagnosed with cancer at age 7, beat it at age 11. Joined the Laborers Union Local 223 at age 21. Elected to the state legislature. Became union president. Then graduated from college at age 42. He is now in his second term as the successful mayor of an iconic American city, and who always puts working people first. Fighting for a $15 minimum wage and paid family leave. Providing frontline workers with emergency child care and the protective equipment they need. Marty understands like I do that the middle class built this country and unions built the middle class. He's seen how union workers have been holding this country together during this crisis. Health care workers keeping our hospitals safe, clean, and effective. Public service workers fighting against budget shortfalls to keep communities afloat. Port workers, car haulers, warehouse workers, and folks keeping our air and rail systems running. They are literally what's keeping us going. And they deserve a Secretary of Labor who knows how to build their power as workers. Who knows that when I say our future will be made in America, it will be a future built by American workers. A future with historic investments in infrastructure, clean energy, manufacturing, and so much more that will create millions of good-paying union jobs. Marty knows worker power means not just protecting the right to unionize but encouraging unionization and collective bargaining. It means protecting pensions. Ensuring worker safety. Increasing the minimum wage. Ensuring workers are paid for the overtime they earned, like we fought to do in the Obama-Biden Administration, but this Administration weakened. And making sure that we have a trade policy where for every decision we make, unions are at the table, focused on winning good jobs for American workers. This is one of the most important departments to me. I trust Mayor Walsh, and I'm honored he accepted. But I also want to say that I did give serious consideration to nominating my friend Senator Bernie Sanders to this position. I'm confident he could've done a fantastic job. I can think of no more passionate and devoted ally of working people in this country. But after Tuesday's result in Georgia, giving Democrats control of the Senate on a tied vote, Bernie and I agreed that we cannot put control of the Senate at risk on the outcome of a special election in Vermont. He agreed we couldn't take that chance. But we also discussed how we would work together, travel the country, helping Marty, and meet with the working men and women who feel forgotten and left behind in the economy. And we agreed that we will work closely on our shared agenda to increase worker powerand protect the dignity of work for all working people. I thank Bernie for his continued friendship and leadership and I look forward to us working together along with Marty. For Administrator of the Small Business Administration, I nominate Isabel Guzman. She grew up in California, working alongside her father in the small veterinary businesses he built. She developed an early understanding of what small businesses mean to their employees, the neighborhoods they support, and the families whose dreams they represent. She dedicated her career to creating jobs and supporting entrepreneurs as a senior official in the Obama-Biden Small Business Administration. As the Director of California's Office of the Small Business Advocate, she works tirelessly to ensure that everyone with an entrepreneurial spark has a fair and equal shot to get off the ground and succeed. The Biden-Harris Administration will be locked in on helping small businesses recover, rebuild, and remain the engines of our economy. And as head of the SBA, Isabel will be leading that critical mission to not only rescue small businesses in crisis, but to provide the capital to entrepreneurs across the country so they can innovate, create jobs, and help lead us into recovery. I am grateful that she has accepted this call to serve. For Deputy Commerce Secretary, I nominate a good and loyal friend, Don Graves. Don is a longtime trusted advisor. He was there at the Treasury Department during the depths of the Great Recession, helping small businesses weather the storm and stay afloat. When President Obama asked me to lead the effort to get Detroit out of bankruptcy and off its back he said I could take anyone in the Administration. So, I went to the Treasury Department and asked for Don to come over and work on it full-time. It was the best decision we made in that effort. He did a great job working with city and state officials on its road to recovery. It's about the small details like the number of buses and street lights that are needed. He also helped me lead our national strategy to equip our workers with the skills they need for the good-paying jobs of the 21st Century, in health care, IT, clean energy, advanced manufacturing, and more. And he was there to help me launch the National Cancer Moonshot and marshal the full resources of the federal government to help end cancer as we know it. A cancer survivor himself, diagnosed and treated while he was working for me, Don knows about hope and resilience. I'm grateful to him and his wonderful family for answering the call to serve once again. And thanks to all of you and your families for serving. And to the American people , I know times are tough. But I want you to know that we will get through this. Help is on the way. This team knows what it's like. They know what to do. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. I'll now turn it over to the team, starting with the next Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh. After they are done, I will take your questions."}

{"SpeechID":"VSJB1412021170","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2021-01-14","SpeechTitle":"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by President-elect Joe Biden on the American Rescue Plan and Build Back Better Re ...","Type":"speech","RawText":"Good evening, my fellow Americans. It's been three hundred and forty-three days since the virus that has ravaged our nation\ntragically claimed its first life. On February 6, 2020, Patricia Dowd took her last breath at home, under the California sun of Santa Clara. She was 57 years old. A beloved wife, mother, daughter, and sister. She never knew she had the virus, at a time when most folks never even heard about the virus. But just like that, she was gone. Almost exactly one year later, nearly 400,000 of our fellow Americans have met the same cruel fate. Countless families and friends left behind, with unrelenting grief and guilt, anger and frustration. And the emptiness felt by the loss of life is compounded by the loss of our way of life. During this pandemic, millions of Americans , through no fault of their own , have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. Millions of Americans who never thought they'd be out of work are facing eviction or waiting hours in their car to feed their families as they drive up to a food bank. Millions who have kept their job but have seen their hours and paycheck reduced are barely hanging on as well. That is happening today in the United States of America. Just as we are in the midst of a dark winter of this pandemic as cases, hospitalizations, and deaths spike at record levels, there is real pain overwhelming the real economy. The one where people rely on their paycheck , not their investments , to pay their bills, their meals, and their children's needs. You won't see this pain if your score card is how things are going on Wall Street. But you will see it very clearly if you examine what the twin crises of the pandemic and the sinking economy have laid bare. The growing divide between those few people at the very top who are doing quite well in this economy , and the rest of America. Just since this pandemic began, the wealth of the top 1% has grown by roughly $1.5 trillion since the end of last year , four times the amount for the entire bottom 50%. Some 18 million Americans are still relying on unemployment insurance. Some 400,000 small businesses have permanently closed their doors. It's not hard to see that we are in the middle of a once-in-several generation economic crisis within a once-in-several generation public health crisis. A crisis of deep human suffering in plain sight. And there is no time to wait. We have to act and act now. This is what the economists are telling us. More importantly, it is what the values we hold in our hearts as Americans are telling us. A growing chorus of top economists agree that, in this moment of crisis, with interest rates at historic lows, we cannot afford inaction. It's not just that smart fiscal investments, including deficit spending, are more urgent than ever. It's that the return on these investments , in jobs, in racial equity , will prevent long-term economic damage and the benefits will far surpass the costs. A growing number of top economists has shown even our debt situation will be more stable , not less stable , if we seize this moment with vision and purpose. And so, tonight, I'd like to talk to you about our way forward. A two-step plan of rescue and recovery. A two-step plan to build a bridge to the other side of the crises we face and to a better, stronger, more secure America. Tonight, I'll lay out the first step , the American Rescue Plan , that will tackle the pandemic and get direct financial assistance and relief to Americans who need it the most. Next month, in my first appearance before a Joint Session of Congress, I will lay out the second step, my Build Back Better Recovery Plan. It will make historic investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy. Investments in the caregiving economy and in skills and training needed by our workers to compete and win the global economy of the future. Moody's , an independent Wall Street firm , said this approach would create more than 18 million jobs. Our rescue and recovery plan is the path forward with a seriousness of purpose, a clear plan with transparency and accountability with a call for unity that is equally necessary. Unity is not a pie-in-the-sky dream, it is a practical step to getting things done. As I said when it passed in December, the bipartisan COVID-19 relief package was an important first step. I am grateful for the Democratic, Republican, and Independent members of Congress who came together to get it done. But as I said at the time, it's just a down-payment. We need more action, more bipartisanship, and we need to move fast. Our rescue plan starts aggressively in order to speed up our national COVID-19 response. The vaccines offer so much hope. We are grateful to the scientists and researchers, and everyone who participated in the clinical trials. We are also grateful for the rigorous review and testing that's led to millions of people around the world already being vaccinated safely. But, the vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far. Tomorrow, I will lay out our vaccination plan to correct course and meet our goal of 100 million shots by the end of our first 100 days. This will be one of the most challenging operational efforts we have ever undertaken as a nation. We will move Heaven and Earth to get more people vaccinated, to create more places for them to get vaccinated, to mobilize more medical teams to get shots in peoples' arms, and to increase vaccine supply and get it out the door as fast as possible. We will also do everything we can to keep our educators and students safe and to safely open a majority of our K-8 schools by the end of our first 100 days. We can do it, if we give school districts, communities, and states the clear guidance they need as well as the resources they will need that they can not afford right now because of the economic crisis we are in. That means more testing and transportation, additional cleaning and sanitizing services, protective equipment, and ventilation systems in the schools. And we need to make sure that workers who have COVID-19 symptoms and are quarantined, and those who need to take care of family members with COVID-19 symptoms should be able to stay home from work and still get paid. This will reduce spread of the virus and make sure workers get the support they need. But they need about $400 billion in funding from Congress to make all of this happen. It's a lot, but I'm convinced we are ready to get this done. The very health of our nation is at stake. Our rescue plan also includes immediate relief for Americans hardest hit and most in need. We will finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in direct relief to people who need it the most. $600 is simply not enough if you still have to choose between paying rent and putting food on the table. Even for those who have kept their jobs these checks are really important. You see, if you are an American worker making $40,000 a year with less than $400 in savings, maybe you've lost hours, or maybe you're doing fewer shifts driving a truck, or caring for kids, or the elderly. You're out there putting your life on the line to work during this pandemic and worried every week that you'll get sick, lose your job, or worse. $2,000 is going to go a long way to ease that pain. We will also provide more peace of mind for struggling families by extending unemployment insurance benefits for millions of workers. That means that the 18 million Americans currently relying on unemployment benefitswhile they look for work can count on these checks continuing to be there. Plus, there will be a $400 per week supplement to help make ends meet. This gets money quickly into the pockets of millions of Americans who will spend it immediately on food, rent, and other basic needs. That helps our whole economy grow. We will also tackle the growing hunger crisis in America. As I speak, and as Vice President-elect Harris has spoken about this many times, 1 in 7 households in America , more than 1 in 5 Black and Latino households in America , report that they do not have enough food to eat. This includes 30 million adults and as many as 12 million children. It's wrong. It's tragic. It's unacceptable. We will extend emergency nutrition assistance for 43 million children and families enrolled in the SNAP program through the rest of this year. And we will help hard-hit restaurants prepare meals for the hungry and provide food for families who need it. We will also invest $3 billion in making sure mothers and their young children have the nutrition they need. This would not only meet our moral obligation we have to one another, but it would also spur our economy and get restaurant workers back on the job. As we work to keep people from going hungry, we will also work to keep a roof over their heads to stem the growing housing crisis in America. Approximately 14 million Americans have fallen behind on rent, many at risk of eviction. If we don't act now there will be a wave of evictions and foreclosures in the coming months as the pandemic rages on. This would overwhelm emergency shelters and increase COVID-19 infections as people have nowhere to go and can't socially distance. Next week we will take action to extend nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures. This would provide more than 25 million Americans greater stability instead of living on the edge every single month. And, I am asking Congress to do its part by funding rental assistance for 14 million hard-hit families and tenants. It will also be a bridge to economic recovery for countless mom and pop landlords. These crises are straining the budgets of states, cities, and tribal communities that are forced to consider layoffs and service reductions. It means the people putting their lives at risk are the very people now at risk of losing their jobs. Police officers. Firefighters. All first responders. Nurses. Educators. Over the last year, more than 600,000 education jobs have been lost in our cities and towns. Our rescue plan will provide emergency funding to keep these essential workers on the job and maintain essential services. It will ensure that vaccines are administered and schools can re-open. Vice President-elect Harris and I have been speaking with county officials, mayors, and governors of both parties on a regular basis. We are ready to work with them to help get the relief they need. Our rescue plan will also help small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth and economy as a whole. They are the glue that holds communities together. But they are hurting badly, and they account for nearly half of the entire U.S. workforce. Our rescue plan will provide flexible grants to help the hardest hit small businesses survive the pandemic. And low-cost capital to help entrepreneurs of all backgrounds create and maintain jobs, plus provide the essential goods and services that communities depend on. Last week, I laid out how we will make sure our emergency small business relief is distributed swiftly and equitably. It will focus on small businesses on Main Street. It will focus on minority-owned small businesses and women-owned small businesses finally having equal access to the resources they need to reopen and rebuild. And, we will be responsible with taxpayer dollars ensuring accountability that reduces waste, fraud, or abuse like we did with the Recovery Act during the Obama-Biden Administration. Direct cash payments. Extended unemployment insurance. Rent relief. Food assistance. Keeping essential frontline workers on the job. Aid to small businesses. These are key elements of the American Rescue Plan that would lift 12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half. That's 5 million children lifted out of poverty. Our plan would reduce poverty in the Black community by one-third. It would reduce poverty in the Hispanic community by almost forty percent. And it includes much more, like an increase of the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour. No one working 40 hours a week should still be below the poverty line. It includes access to affordable child care that will enable parents, particularly women, to get back to work. I look forward to working with members of Congress from both parties to move quickly to get the American Rescue Plan to the American people. And then we can move with equal urgency and bipartisanship to my Build Back Better Recovery Plan that I will call for next month to generate even more economic growth. American manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in World War II. It will be so again. Imagine the future Made in America in all of America and all by Americans. We will use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America. We will buy American products and support millions of American manufacturing jobs and enhance our competitive strength in an increasingly competitive world. Imagine historic investments in Research & Development to sharpen America's innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs, markets like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and clean energy. Imagine confronting the climate crisis with American jobs and ingenuity leading the world. It's time to stop talking about infrastructure and finally start building it. Millions of good-paying jobs that put Americans to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, and ports to make them more climate resilient, to make it faster, cheaper, and cleaner to transport American-made goods across our country and around the world. And, imagine millions of jobs in our caregiving economy to ease the financial burden of caring for young children and aging loved ones. Let's make sure our caregivers, mostly women, women of color, and immigrants, have the pay and dignity they deserve. We can do these bold, practical things now. I know what I just described will not come cheaply. But failing to do so will cost us dearly. The consensus among leading economists is we simply cannot afford not to do it. Independent, respected institutions from around the world from the Federal Reserve to the International Monetary Fund have underscored the urgency. Even Wall Street firms have reinforced the logic. If we invest now, boldly, smartly, and with an unwavering focus on American workers and families we will strengthen our economy, reduce inequity, and put our nation's long term finances on a more sustainable course. And where we are making permanent investments as I said on the campaign, we will pay for them by making sure that everyone pays their fair share in taxes. We can do it without punishing anyone by closing tax loopholes for companies that ship American jobs overseas or that allow American companies to pay zero in federal income taxes. Asking everyone to pay their fair share so we can make permanent investments to rescue and rebuild America is the right thing for our economy, it's the fair thing and decent thing to do. But we not only have an economic imperative to act now, we have a moral obligation. In this pandemic, in America, we cannot let people go hungry. We cannot let people get evicted. We cannot watch nurses and educators and others lose their jobs. We must act now and decisively. My fellow Americans, the decisions we make in the next few weeks and months will determine whether we thrive in a way that benefits all Americans, or whether we stay stuck in a place where those at the top do great while economic growth for most everyone else is just a spectator sport , where America's prospects dim, not brighten. They will determine whether we reassert American leadership and outcompete our competitors in the global economy or whether we watch them catch up and pass us by. Together I know we will choose a path that includes all Americans so we own the 21st Century. But even with all of these bold steps, it will take time to get where we need to be. There will be stumbles. But I will always be honest with you about both the progress we're making and the setbacks we meet. Here's the deal , the more people we vaccinate, and the faster we do it, the sooner we can save lives put this pandemic behind us and get back to our lives and loved ones. The sooner we can rescue and rebuild our economy. I know it's been nearly a year that's\ntested us beyond measure. For all of you who have lost someone my heart goes out to you. I know what it's like to stare at the empty chair. For those who have fallen on hard times, I know you can never get back what you lost. But as your president, I know that every day matters, and every person matters. From the very first to the nearly 400,000 lost American souls and counting, and to the millions of you just looking for a fighting chance in this economy: I will not forget what you're going through. We understand what you're going through. We will not give up. We will come back together. While we didn't get into all of this overnight, we won't get out of it overnight, and we can't do it as a divided nation. The only way we come through this is together as fellow Americans and as the United States of America. And when we do, there is nothing beyond our capacity. Out of all the peril of this moment I want you to know, I see all the promise as well. I remain as optimistic about America as I have ever been. Come Wednesday, we begin a new chapter. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1494449\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-the-american-rescue-plan-and-build-back-better-recovery-plan-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Unemployed and Low-Income Employment and Affirmative Action Health and Health Care Economy and Fiscal","Source":null,"Location":"Wilmington, DE","Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-the-american-rescue-plan-and-build-back-better-recovery-plan-in-wilmington-delaware\/","CleanText":"Good evening, my fellow Americans. It's been three hundred and forty-three days since the virus that has ravaged our nation tragically claimed its first life. On February 6, 2020, Patricia Dowd took her last breath at home, under the California sun of Santa Clara. She was 57 years old. A beloved wife, mother, daughter, and sister. She never knew she had the virus, at a time when most folks never even heard about the virus. But just like that, she was gone. Almost exactly one year later, nearly 400,000 of our fellow Americans have met the same cruel fate. Countless families and friends left behind, with unrelenting grief and guilt, anger and frustration. And the emptiness felt by the loss of life is compounded by the loss of our way of life. During this pandemic, millions of Americans , through no fault of their own , have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. Millions of Americans who never thought they'd be out of work are facing eviction or waiting hours in their car to feed their families as they drive up to a food bank. Millions who have kept their job but have seen their hours and paycheck reduced are barely hanging on as well. That is happening today in the United States of America. Just as we are in the midst of a dark winter of this pandemic as cases, hospitalizations, and deaths spike at record levels, there is real pain overwhelming the real economy. The one where people rely on their paycheck , not their investments , to pay their bills, their meals, and their children's needs. You won't see this pain if your score card is how things are going on Wall Street. But you will see it very clearly if you examine what the twin crises of the pandemic and the sinking economy have laid bare. The growing divide between those few people at the very top who are doing quite well in this economy , and the rest of America. Just since this pandemic began, the wealth of the top 1% has grown by roughly $1.5 trillion since the end of last year , four times the amount for the entire bottom 50%. Some 18 million Americans are still relying on unemployment insurance. Some 400,000 small businesses have permanently closed their doors. It's not hard to see that we are in the middle of a once-in-several generation economic crisis within a once-in-several generation public health crisis. A crisis of deep human suffering in plain sight. And there is no time to wait. We have to act and act now. This is what the economists are telling us. More importantly, it is what the values we hold in our hearts as Americans are telling us. A growing chorus of top economists agree that, in this moment of crisis, with interest rates at historic lows, we cannot afford inaction. It's not just that smart fiscal investments, including deficit spending, are more urgent than ever. It's that the return on these investments , in jobs, in racial equity , will prevent long-term economic damage and the benefits will far surpass the costs. A growing number of top economists has shown even our debt situation will be more stable , not less stable , if we seize this moment with vision and purpose. And so, tonight, I'd like to talk to you about our way forward. A two-step plan of rescue and recovery. A two-step plan to build a bridge to the other side of the crises we face and to a better, stronger, more secure America. Tonight, I'll lay out the first step , the American Rescue Plan , that will tackle the pandemic and get direct financial assistance and relief to Americans who need it the most. Next month, in my first appearance before a Joint Session of Congress, I will lay out the second step, my Build Back Better Recovery Plan. It will make historic investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy. Investments in the caregiving economy and in skills and training needed by our workers to compete and win the global economy of the future. Moody's , an independent Wall Street firm , said this approach would create more than 18 million jobs. Our rescue and recovery plan is the path forward with a seriousness of purpose, a clear plan with transparency and accountability with a call for unity that is equally necessary. Unity is not a pie-in-the-sky dream, it is a practical step to getting things done. As I said when it passed in December, the bipartisan COVID-19 relief package was an important first step. I am grateful for the Democratic, Republican, and Independent members of Congress who came together to get it done. But as I said at the time, it's just a down-payment. We need more action, more bipartisanship, and we need to move fast. Our rescue plan starts aggressively in order to speed up our national COVID-19 response. The vaccines offer so much hope. We are grateful to the scientists and researchers, and everyone who participated in the clinical trials. We are also grateful for the rigorous review and testing that's led to millions of people around the world already being vaccinated safely. But, the vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far. Tomorrow, I will lay out our vaccination plan to correct course and meet our goal of 100 million shots by the end of our first 100 days. This will be one of the most challenging operational efforts we have ever undertaken as a nation. We will move Heaven and Earth to get more people vaccinated, to create more places for them to get vaccinated, to mobilize more medical teams to get shots in peoples' arms, and to increase vaccine supply and get it out the door as fast as possible. We will also do everything we can to keep our educators and students safe and to safely open a majority of our K-8 schools by the end of our first 100 days. We can do it, if we give school districts, communities, and states the clear guidance they need as well as the resources they will need that they can not afford right now because of the economic crisis we are in. That means more testing and transportation, additional cleaning and sanitizing services, protective equipment, and ventilation systems in the schools. And we need to make sure that workers who have COVID-19 symptoms and are quarantined, and those who need to take care of family members with COVID-19 symptoms should be able to stay home from work and still get paid. This will reduce spread of the virus and make sure workers get the support they need. But they need about $400 billion in funding from Congress to make all of this happen. It's a lot, but I'm convinced we are ready to get this done. The very health of our nation is at stake. Our rescue plan also includes immediate relief for Americans hardest hit and most in need. We will finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in direct relief to people who need it the most. $600 is simply not enough if you still have to choose between paying rent and putting food on the table. Even for those who have kept their jobs these checks are really important. You see, if you are an American worker making $40,000 a year with less than $400 in savings, maybe you've lost hours, or maybe you're doing fewer shifts driving a truck, or caring for kids, or the elderly. You're out there putting your life on the line to work during this pandemic and worried every week that you'll get sick, lose your job, or worse. $2,000 is going to go a long way to ease that pain. We will also provide more peace of mind for struggling families by extending unemployment insurance benefits for millions of workers. That means that the 18 million Americans currently relying on unemployment benefitswhile they look for work can count on these checks continuing to be there. Plus, there will be a $400 per week supplement to help make ends meet. This gets money quickly into the pockets of millions of Americans who will spend it immediately on food, rent, and other basic needs. That helps our whole economy grow. We will also tackle the growing hunger crisis in America. As I speak, and as Vice President-elect Harris has spoken about this many times, 1 in 7 households in America , more than 1 in 5 Black and Latino households in America , report that they do not have enough food to eat. This includes 30 million adults and as many as 12 million children. It's wrong. It's tragic. It's unacceptable. We will extend emergency nutrition assistance for 43 million children and families enrolled in the SNAP program through the rest of this year. And we will help hard-hit restaurants prepare meals for the hungry and provide food for families who need it. We will also invest $3 billion in making sure mothers and their young children have the nutrition they need. This would not only meet our moral obligation we have to one another, but it would also spur our economy and get restaurant workers back on the job. As we work to keep people from going hungry, we will also work to keep a roof over their heads to stem the growing housing crisis in America. Approximately 14 million Americans have fallen behind on rent, many at risk of eviction. If we don't act now there will be a wave of evictions and foreclosures in the coming months as the pandemic rages on. This would overwhelm emergency shelters and increase COVID-19 infections as people have nowhere to go and can't socially distance. Next week we will take action to extend nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures. This would provide more than 25 million Americans greater stability instead of living on the edge every single month. And, I am asking Congress to do its part by funding rental assistance for 14 million hard-hit families and tenants. It will also be a bridge to economic recovery for countless mom and pop landlords. These crises are straining the budgets of states, cities, and tribal communities that are forced to consider layoffs and service reductions. It means the people putting their lives at risk are the very people now at risk of losing their jobs. Police officers. Firefighters. All first responders. Nurses. Educators. Over the last year, more than 600,000 education jobs have been lost in our cities and towns. Our rescue plan will provide emergency funding to keep these essential workers on the job and maintain essential services. It will ensure that vaccines are administered and schools can re-open. Vice President-elect Harris and I have been speaking with county officials, mayors, and governors of both parties on a regular basis. We are ready to work with them to help get the relief they need. Our rescue plan will also help small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth and economy as a whole. They are the glue that holds communities together. But they are hurting badly, and they account for nearly half of the entire U.S. workforce. Our rescue plan will provide flexible grants to help the hardest hit small businesses survive the pandemic. And low-cost capital to help entrepreneurs of all backgrounds create and maintain jobs, plus provide the essential goods and services that communities depend on. Last week, I laid out how we will make sure our emergency small business relief is distributed swiftly and equitably. It will focus on small businesses on Main Street. It will focus on minority-owned small businesses and women-owned small businesses finally having equal access to the resources they need to reopen and rebuild. And, we will be responsible with taxpayer dollars ensuring accountability that reduces waste, fraud, or abuse like we did with the Recovery Act during the Obama-Biden Administration. Direct cash payments. Extended unemployment insurance. Rent relief. Food assistance. Keeping essential frontline workers on the job. Aid to small businesses. These are key elements of the American Rescue Plan that would lift 12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half. That's 5 million children lifted out of poverty. Our plan would reduce poverty in the Black community by one-third. It would reduce poverty in the Hispanic community by almost forty percent. And it includes much more, like an increase of the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour. No one working 40 hours a week should still be below the poverty line. It includes access to affordable child care that will enable parents, particularly women, to get back to work. I look forward to working with members of Congress from both parties to move quickly to get the American Rescue Plan to the American people. And then we can move with equal urgency and bipartisanship to my Build Back Better Recovery Plan that I will call for next month to generate even more economic growth. American manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in World War II. It will be so again. Imagine the future Made in America in all of America and all by Americans. We will use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America. We will buy American products and support millions of American manufacturing jobs and enhance our competitive strength in an increasingly competitive world. Imagine historic investments in Research & Development to sharpen America's innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs, markets like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and clean energy. Imagine confronting the climate crisis with American jobs and ingenuity leading the world. It's time to stop talking about infrastructure and finally start building it. Millions of good-paying jobs that put Americans to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, and ports to make them more climate resilient, to make it faster, cheaper, and cleaner to transport American-made goods across our country and around the world. And, imagine millions of jobs in our caregiving economy to ease the financial burden of caring for young children and aging loved ones. Let's make sure our caregivers, mostly women, women of color, and immigrants, have the pay and dignity they deserve. We can do these bold, practical things now. I know what I just described will not come cheaply. But failing to do so will cost us dearly. The consensus among leading economists is we simply cannot afford not to do it. Independent, respected institutions from around the world from the Federal Reserve to the International Monetary Fund have underscored the urgency. Even Wall Street firms have reinforced the logic. If we invest now, boldly, smartly, and with an unwavering focus on American workers and families we will strengthen our economy, reduce inequity, and put our nation's long term finances on a more sustainable course. And where we are making permanent investments as I said on the campaign, we will pay for them by making sure that everyone pays their fair share in taxes. We can do it without punishing anyone by closing tax loopholes for companies that ship American jobs overseas or that allow American companies to pay zero in federal income taxes. Asking everyone to pay their fair share so we can make permanent investments to rescue and rebuild America is the right thing for our economy, it's the fair thing and decent thing to do. But we not only have an economic imperative to act now, we have a moral obligation. In this pandemic, in America, we cannot let people go hungry. We cannot let people get evicted.

Last night, I spoke to the nation about the human toll of the pandemic and economic crises. I spoke about our two-step plan of rescue and recovery, and how we must deliver immediate economic relief to those who need it the most in this country. The millions of people who, through no fault of their own, are badly hurting. Millions who never thought they'd ever be out of work, facing eviction, or waiting hours in their car for a meal from a foodbank. I talked about how our rescue plan is a necessary bridge to our economic recovery and our ability to build back better, stronger, and more secure. And while the crises have cost real damage, I explained how it will cost more, hundreds of billions of dollars, to undo the harm. I talked about our moral obligation to act and about the clear economic consensus that making the investments I'm calling for that require deficit spending, are necessary to get us out of the deep hole we are in. I also talked about our seriousness of purpose. Our clear plan with transparency and accountability, and why our call for unity is equally necessary. Unity is not a pie-in-sky dream , it is a practical step to getting things done. We didn't get into all of this overnight, and we won't get out of it overnight, either. But we will get through it , together. And today, I'd like to talk more about what that means in sparing no effort to get America vaccinated. Vice President-elect Harris and I just received a briefing from our COVID team. Truthfully, we remain in a very dark winter. Infection rates are up 34%. More people are being hospitalized because of COVID than ever before. We're up to 3,000-4,000 deaths per day as we approach the grim milestone of 400,000 deaths in America. That's staggering. I know the pain so many of you are experiencing, staring at the empty chair around the kitchen table where a loved one used to sit, laugh, and love. I know the frustration we are all feeling. Almost a year later, we're still far from back to normal. The honest truth is this: things will get worse before they get better. And the policy changes we will be making will take time to show up in the COVID statistics, and they are not just statistics, but people's lives.. People getting infected today don't show up in case counts for weeks. Those who perish from the disease die weeks after exposure. So, it will take time, but I know there are things we can do. For example, the vaccines offer so much hope. We are grateful to the scientists and researchers, and everyone who participated in the clinical trials. We are grateful for the integrity of the process , the rigorous review and testing that's led to millions of people around the world already being vaccinated safely. But the vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure. And, in today's briefing, we discussed five things we will do to turn things around, five things to turn the frustration into motivation, five things to help us meet our goal of 100 million shots by the end of our first 100 days. Some wonder if we are reaching too far with that goal. Is it achievable? Let me be clear: I am convinced we can get it done. And this is the time to set big goals and to pursue them with courage and conviction because the health of the nation is at stake. First, we will immediately work with states to open up vaccinations to more priority groups. The process of establishing priority groups is driven by science, but the problem is the implementation has been too rigid and confusing. If you were to ask most people today, they couldn't tell you who exactly should be getting vaccinated. What they do know is there are tens of millions of doses of vaccines sitting unused in a freezer, while people who want and need the vaccine can't get it. We'll fix the problem by encouraging states to allow more people to get vaccinated beyond health care workers and move through these groups as quickly as states think they can. That includes anyone 65 and older , a population that has accounted for 80% of the deaths to date. We must also continue vaccinating frontline essential workers like educators, first responders, and grocery store workers. It won't mean that everyone in these groups will get vaccinated immediately, as supply is not where it needs to be. But it will mean that as vaccines become available, they will reach more people who need them. Second, if we're getting more people vaccinated, then we need more vaccination sites. That's why we will harness the full resources of the federal government to establish thousands of community vaccination centers. On my first day in office, I will instruct the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to begin setting up the first of these centers. By the end of our first month in office, we will have 100 federally-supported centers across the nation that will ultimately vaccinate millions of people. Think of places that are convenient and accessible. School gyms. Sports stadiums. Community centers. We've already had productive conversations with bipartisan groups of county officials, mayors, governors, tribal leaders, and leaders in the private sector who shared their ideas about this effort. And as we build them, we will make sure it's done equitably. We'll make sure there are vaccination centers in communities hit hardest by the pandemic, in Black and Latino communities, and rural communities as well. Within the first month of our administration, we will deploy mobile clinics. We will partner with community health centers, and local primary care doctors to offer vaccines to hard-to-reach communities in cities, small towns, and rural communities. And to staff the centers up, we will mobilize thousands of clinical and non-clinical professionals. Think of the people we deploy in natural disasters, experts at FEMA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, our Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, our military medical personnel, and our first responders. Additionally we will expand the pool of medical professionals, including retired healthcare workers, who can administer the vaccine and to ensure we have enough vaccinators to meet the nation's needs. And as governors of both parties have asked, our administration will reimburse states 100 percent when their National Guard is deployed in the fight against COVID-19. We will provide resources to help states cover the costs of personnel, vaccinators and administrative staff, as well as supplies like dry ice, laptops, and protective equipment. Third, we are going to fully activate pharmacies across the country to get the vaccines into more arms as quickly as possible. Millions of Americans turn to their local pharmacies every day for their medicines, flu shots, and much more. We will immediately start a new major effort working directly with both independent and chain pharmacies to get America vaccinated. This program will expand access in neighborhoods across the country so you can make an appointment and get your shot conveniently and quickly. Fourth, we will use the full strength of the federal government to ramp up supply of the vaccines. As I've said before, we will use the Defense Production Act to work with private industry to accelerate the making of materials needed to supply and administer the vaccine, from tubes and syringes to protective equipment. We've identified the suppliers and are prepared to work with their teams. As we made clear earlier this month, the Trump administration policy of holding back close to half of the supply did not make sense. My administration will release the vast majority of the vaccines when they are available, so more people can get vaccinated quickly, while still retaining a small reserve for any unforeseen shortages or delays. Let me be clear: we are not changing the FDA's recommended dosing schedule. We believe it is critical that everyone should get two doses within that FDA recommended timeframe. And fifth, we will always be honest and transparent about where we stand , both the good news and the bad. We will make sure that state and local officials know how much supply they are getting and when to expect it so they can plan. Right now, we are hearing that they can't plan because they don't know how much supply of vaccines they can expect and what time frame. That stops when we are in office. We also promise to provide regular updates to you, the American people, on our progress and our goals. We will be transparent about the decisions we are making and why. Our administration will lead with science and scientists with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health that are free from political influence, a Surgeon General who is independent and speaks directly to the people, and an FDA whose decisions are based on science and science alone. While millions of Americans have already gotten the vaccine and millions more are ready to get it, we also know that we need to address vaccine hesitancy and build trust in many communities. We know that's the case, for example, in Black, Latino, and Native American communities, people who have not always been treated with the dignity and honesty they deserve by the federal government and the scientific community throughout our history. We also see that disinformation campaigns are already underway to further undermine trust in the vaccine. Our administration will launch a massive public education campaign to rebuild that trust. We'll help people understand what science tells us: that the vaccines help reduce the risk of COVID infections, and can better safeguard our health and the health of our families and communities. It's a critical piece to account for the tragic reality of the disproportional impact this virus has had on Black, Latino, and Native Americans, people who are being infected at about four timesthe rate of white Americans, and dying at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. This is unacceptable and unconscionable. Equity is central to our COVID response. And the vice president-elect and I commit to making sure communities of color, our rural neighbors, those living with disabilities, and seniors are not left behind in our vaccination plans. Our plan is as clear as it is bold: Get more people vaccinated for free. Create more places for them to get vaccinated. Mobilize more medical teams to get shots into peoples' arms. Increase supply and get it out the door as soon as possible. This will be one of the most challenging operational efforts ever undertaken by our country. You have my word that we will manage the hell out of this operation. But as I said last night, we need funding from Congress to make this happen. And I'm optimistic. I'm convinced the American people are ready to spare no effort and no expense to get this done. All of these steps will take some time. It will take many months to get where we need to be. There will be stumbles. And, yes, I know so much has already been asked of you. And, when we are sworn-in next week, we're going to ask you to keep the faith and keep following what we know works. One of our 100-day challenges is to mask up for the first 100 days. I will be issuing executive orders to require masks for federal workers, on federal property, and on interstate travel, like trains and planes. We will also be working with mayors and Governors in red states and blue states to require masks in cities and states. I know masks have become a partisan issue. But it's a patriotic act. The experts say that by wearing a mask from now until April, we will save more than 50,000 lives. Quite frankly, it was shocking to see members of Congress, while the Capitol was under siegeby a deadly mob of thugs, refuse to wear a mask while they were in a secure location. I'm so proud of my Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester who was trying to get everyone to mask up. But look what happened when they didn't. At least four members of Congress to date, including a cancer survivor, now have COVID-19. For God's sake, wear a mask for yourself, for your loved ones, for your country. These are life and death matters. We need you to stick with the hand washing, social distancing, and avoid indoor gatherings with people outside your household. We'll be a partner to the states and cities, so where things are working, we'll help do more of the good work, and where things can improve, we'll bring more resources to bear to get folks tested and vaccinated. We will work closely with nonprofits and the private sector who we know all want to partner with us in this effort. The more people we vaccinate and the faster we do it, the sooner we can put this pandemic behind us. And the sooner we can build our economy back better, and get back to our lives and loved ones. As we've seen during this pandemic, we can't solve our problems as a divided nation. The only way we come through this is together as fellow Americans and as the United States of America. Vice-President-elect Harris and I ran on that vision. And starting noon on Wednesday, that is exactly how we are going to govern and ask for your help. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1494555\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-the-covid-19-vaccine-plan-in-wilmington-delaware&speechType=1","Summary":"Executive Branch Health and Health Care Economy and Fiscal","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/buildbackbetter.gov\/speeches\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-the-covid-19-vaccine-plan-in-wilmington-delaware\/","CleanText":"Good afternoon.

Vice President-elect Harris and I just received a briefing from our COVID team. Truthfully, we remain in a very dark winter. Infection rates are up 34%. More people are being hospitalized because of COVID than ever before. We're up to 3,000-4,000 deaths per day as we approach the grim milestone of 400,000 deaths in America. That's staggering. I know the pain so many of you are experiencing, staring at the empty chair around the kitchen table where a loved one used to sit, laugh, and love. I know the frustration we are all feeling. Almost a year later, we're still far from back to normal. The honest truth is this: things will get worse before they get better. And the policy changes we will be making will take time to show up in the COVID statistics, and they are not just statistics, but people's lives.. People getting infected today don't show up in case counts for weeks. Those who perish from the disease die weeks after exposure. So, it will take time, but I know there are things we can do. For example, the vaccines offer so much hope. We are grateful to the scientists and researchers, and everyone who participated in the clinical trials. We are grateful for the integrity of the process , the rigorous review and testing that's led to millions of people around the world already being vaccinated safely. But the vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure. And, in today's briefing, we discussed five things we will do to turn things around, five things to turn the frustration into motivation, five things to help us meet our goal of 100 million shots by the end of our first 100 days. Some wonder if we are reaching too far with that goal. Is it achievable? Let me be clear: I am convinced we can get it done. And this is the time to set big goals and to pursue them with courage and conviction because the health of the nation is at stake. First, we will immediately work with states to open up vaccinations to more priority groups. The process of establishing priority groups is driven by science, but the problem is the implementation has been too rigid and confusing. If you were to ask most people today, they couldn't tell you who exactly should be getting vaccinated. What they do know is there are tens of millions of doses of vaccines sitting unused in a freezer, while people who want and need the vaccine can't get it. We'll fix the problem by encouraging states to allow more people to get vaccinated beyond health care workers and move through these groups as quickly as states think they can. That includes anyone 65 and older , a population that has accounted for 80% of the deaths to date. We must also continue vaccinating frontline essential workers like educators, first responders, and grocery store workers. It won't mean that everyone in these groups will get vaccinated immediately, as supply is not where it needs to be. But it will mean that as vaccines become available, they will reach more people who need them. Second, if we're getting more people vaccinated, then we need more vaccination sites. That's why we will harness the full resources of the federal government to establish thousands of community vaccination centers. On my first day in office, I will instruct the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to begin setting up the first of these centers. By the end of our first month in office, we will have 100 federally-supported centers across the nation that will ultimately vaccinate millions of people. Think of places that are convenient and accessible. School gyms. Sports stadiums. Community centers. We've already had productive conversations with bipartisan groups of county officials, mayors, governors, tribal leaders, and leaders in the private sector who shared their ideas about this effort. And as we build them, we will make sure it's done equitably. We'll make sure there are vaccination centers in communities hit hardest by the pandemic, in Black and Latino communities, and rural communities as well. Within the first month of our administration, we will deploy mobile clinics. We will partner with community health centers, and local primary care doctors to offer vaccines to hard-to-reach communities in cities, small towns, and rural communities. And to staff the centers up, we will mobilize thousands of clinical and non-clinical professionals. Think of the people we deploy in natural disasters, experts at FEMA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, our Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, our military medical personnel, and our first responders. Additionally we will expand the pool of medical professionals, including retired healthcare workers, who can administer the vaccine and to ensure we have enough vaccinators to meet the nation's needs. And as governors of both parties have asked, our administration will reimburse states 100 percent when their National Guard is deployed in the fight against COVID-19. We will provide resources to help states cover the costs of personnel, vaccinators and administrative staff, as well as supplies like dry ice, laptops, and protective equipment. Third, we are going to fully activate pharmacies across the country to get the vaccines into more arms as quickly as possible. Millions of Americans turn to their local pharmacies every day for their medicines, flu shots, and much more. We will immediately start a new major effort working directly with both independent and chain pharmacies to get America vaccinated. This program will expand access in neighborhoods across the country so you can make an appointment and get your shot conveniently and quickly. Fourth, we will use the full strength of the federal government to ramp up supply of the vaccines. As I've said before, we will use the Defense Production Act to work with private industry to accelerate the making of materials needed to supply and administer the vaccine, from tubes and syringes to protective equipment. We've identified the suppliers and are prepared to work with their teams. As we made clear earlier this month, the Trump administration policy of holding back close to half of the supply did not make sense. My administration will release the vast majority of the vaccines when they are available, so more people can get vaccinated quickly, while still retaining a small reserve for any unforeseen shortages or delays. Let me be clear: we are not changing the FDA's recommended dosing schedule. We believe it is critical that everyone should get two doses within that FDA recommended timeframe. And fifth, we will always be honest and transparent about where we stand , both the good news and the bad. We will make sure that state and local officials know how much supply they are getting and when to expect it so they can plan. Right now, we are hearing that they can't plan because they don't know how much supply of vaccines they can expect and what time frame. That stops when we are in office. We also promise to provide regular updates to you, the American people, on our progress and our goals. We will be transparent about the decisions we are making and why. Our administration will lead with science and scientists with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health that are free from political influence, a Surgeon General who is independent and speaks directly to the people, and an FDA whose decisions are based on science and science alone. While millions of Americans have already gotten the vaccine and millions more are ready to get it, we also know that we need to address vaccine hesitancy and build trust in many communities. We know that's the case, for example, in Black, Latino, and Native American communities, people who have not always been treated with the dignity and honesty they deserve by the federal government and the scientific community throughout our history. We also see that disinformation campaigns are already underway to further undermine trust in the vaccine. Our administration will launch a massive public education campaign to rebuild that trust. We'll help people understand what science tells us: that the vaccines help reduce the risk of COVID infections, and can better safeguard our health and the health of our families and communities. It's a critical piece to account for the tragic reality of the disproportional impact this virus has had on Black, Latino, and Native Americans, people who are being infected at about four timesthe rate of white Americans, and dying at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. This is unacceptable and unconscionable. Equity is central to our COVID response. And the vice president-elect and I commit to making sure communities of color, our rural neighbors, those living with disabilities, and seniors are not left behind in our vaccination plans. Our plan is as clear as it is bold: Get more people vaccinated for free. Create more places for them to get vaccinated. Mobilize more medical teams to get shots into peoples' arms. Increase supply and get it out the door as soon as possible. This will be one of the most challenging operational efforts ever undertaken by our country. You have my word that we will manage the hell out of this operation. But as I said last night, we need funding from Congress to make this happen. And I'm optimistic. I'm convinced the American people are ready to spare no effort and no expense to get this done. All of these steps will take some time. It will take many months to get where we need to be. There will be stumbles. And, yes, I know so much has already been asked of you. And, when we are sworn-in next week, we're going to ask you to keep the faith and keep following what we know works. One of our 100-day challenges is to mask up for the first 100 days. I will be issuing executive orders to require masks for federal workers, on federal property, and on interstate travel, like trains and planes. We will also be working with mayors and Governors in red states and blue states to require masks in cities and states. I know masks have become a partisan issue. But it's a patriotic act. The experts say that by wearing a mask from now until April, we will save more than 50,000 lives. Quite frankly, it was shocking to see members of Congress, while the Capitol was under siegeby a deadly mob of thugs, refuse to wear a mask while they were in a secure location. I'm so proud of my Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester who was trying to get everyone to mask up. But look what happened when they didn't. At least four members of Congress to date, including a cancer survivor, now have COVID-19. For God's sake, wear a mask for yourself, for your loved ones, for your country. These are life and death matters. We need you to stick with the hand washing, social distancing, and avoid indoor gatherings with people outside your household. We'll be a partner to the states and cities, so where things are working, we'll help do more of the good work, and where things can improve, we'll bring more resources to bear to get folks tested and vaccinated. We will work closely with nonprofits and the private sector who we know all want to partner with us in this effort. The more people we vaccinate and the faster we do it, the sooner we can put this pandemic behind us. And the sooner we can build our economy back better, and get back to our lives and loved ones. As we've seen during this pandemic, we can't solve our problems as a divided nation. The only way we come through this is together as fellow Americans and as the United States of America. Vice-President-elect Harris and I ran on that vision. And starting noon on Wednesday, that is exactly how we are going to govern and ask for your help. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops."}

Biden, Jr.","Type":"speech","RawText":"Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans. This is America's day. This is democracy's day. A day of history and hope. Of renewal and resolve. Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge. Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded. We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. So now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this Capitol's very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. We look ahead in our uniquely American way , restless, bold, optimistic , and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be. I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. You know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation. As does President Carter, who I spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service. I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took , an oath first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us. On \"We the People\" who seek a more perfect Union. This is a great nation and we are a good people. Over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we still have far to go. We will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility. Much to repair. Much to restore. Much to heal. Much to build. And much to gain. Few periods in our nation's history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we're in now. A once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country. It's taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear. And now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat. To overcome these challenges , to restore the soul and to secure the future of America , requires more than words. It requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: Unity. Unity. In another January in Washington, on New Year's Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper, the President said, \"If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.\" My whole soul is in it. Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: Bringing America together. Uniting our people. And uniting our nation. I ask every American to join me in this cause. Uniting to fight the common foes we face: Anger, resentment, hatred. Extremism, lawlessness, violence. Disease, joblessness, hopelessness. With unity we can do great things. Important things. We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome this deadly virus. We can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health caresecure for all. We can deliver racial justice. We can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the world. I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial. Victory is never assured. Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9\/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our \"better angels\" have always prevailed. In each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward. And, we can do so now. History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity. We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And, we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail. We have never, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together. And so today, at this time and in this place, let us start afresh. All of us. Let us listen to one another. Hear one another.See one another. Show respect to one another. Politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war. And, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured. My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. America has to be better than this. And, I believe America is better than this. Just look around. Here we stand, in the shadow of a Capitol dome that was completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself hung in the balance. Yet we endured and we prevailed. Here we stand looking out to the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream. Here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protestors tried to block brave women from marching for the right to vote. Today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office , Vice President Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things can't change. Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington National Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace. And here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive us from this sacred ground. That did not happen. It will never happen. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. To all those who supported our campaign I am humbled by the faith you have placed in us. To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. And if you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion. And I pledge this to you: I will be a President for all Americans. I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did. Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love. What are the common objects we love that define us as Americans? I think I know. Opportunity. Security. Liberty. Dignity. Respect. Honor. And, yes, the truth. Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are lies. Lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders , leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation , to defend the truth and to defeat the lies. I understand that many Americans view the future with some fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs, about taking care of their families, about what comes next. I get it. But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don't look like you do, or worship the way you do, or don't get their news from the same sources you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility. If we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes just for a moment.Because here is the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal you. There are some days when we need a hand. There are other days when we're called on to lend one. That is how we must be with one another. And, if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each other. We will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. We are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside the politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation. I promise you this: as the Bible says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning. We will get through this, together The world is watching today. So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we have come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. Not to meet yesterday's challenges, but today's and tomorrow's. We will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example. We will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security. We have been through so much in this nation. And, in my first act as President, I would like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic. To those 400,000 fellow Americans , mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers. We will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be. Let us say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our country. Amen. This is a time of testing. We face an attack on democracy and on truth. A raging virus. Growing inequity. The sting of systemic racism. A climate in crisis. America's role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilities. Now we must step up. All of us. It is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do. And, this is certain. We will be judged, you and I, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era. Will we rise to the occasion? Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our children? I believe we must and I believe we will. And when we do, we will write the next chapter in the American story. It's a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. It's called \"American Anthem\" and there is one verse stands out for me: \"The work and prayersof centuries have brought us to this dayWhat shall be our legacy?What will our children say? Let me know in my heartWhen my days are throughAmericaAmericaI gave my best to you.\" Let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nation. If we do this then when our days are through our children and our children's children will say of us they gave their best. They did their duty. They healed a broken land.My fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with a sacred oath. Before God and all of you I give you my word. I will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution. I will defend our democracy. I will defend America. I will give my all in your service thinking not of power, but of possibilities. Not of personal interest, but of the public good. And together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear. Of unity, not division. Of light, not darkness. An American story of decency and dignity. Of love and of healing. Of greatness and of goodness. May this be the story that guides us. The story that inspires us. The story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history. We met the moment. That democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrived. That our America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. That is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow. So, with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time. Sustained by faith. Driven by conviction. And, devoted to one another and to this country we love with all our hearts. May God bless America and may God protect our troops. Thank you, America.

This is America's day. This is democracy's day. A day of history and hope. Of renewal and resolve. Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge. Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded. We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. So now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this Capitol's very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. We look ahead in our uniquely American way , restless, bold, optimistic , and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be. I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. You know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation. As does President Carter, who I spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service. I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took , an oath first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us. On 'We the People' who seek a more perfect Union. This is a great nation and we are a good people. Over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we still have far to go. We will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility. Much to repair. Much to restore. Much to heal. Much to build. And much to gain. Few periods in our nation's history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we're in now. A once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country. It's taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear. And now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat. To overcome these challenges , to restore the soul and to secure the future of America , requires more than words. It requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: Unity. Unity. In another January in Washington, on New Year's Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper, the President said, 'If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.' My whole soul is in it. Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: Bringing America together. Uniting our people. And uniting our nation. I ask every American to join me in this cause. Uniting to fight the common foes we face: Anger, resentment, hatred. Extremism, lawlessness, violence. Disease, joblessness, hopelessness. With unity we can do great things. Important things. We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome this deadly virus. We can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health caresecure for all. We can deliver racial justice. We can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the world. I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial. Victory is never assured. Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9\/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our 'better angels' have always prevailed. In each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward. And, we can do so now. History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity. We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And, we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail. We have never, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together. And so today, at this time and in this place, let us start afresh. All of us. Let us listen to one another. Hear one another.See one another. Show respect to one another. Politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war. And, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured. My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. America has to be better than this. And, I believe America is better than this. Just look around. Here we stand, in the shadow of a Capitol dome that was completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself hung in the balance. Yet we endured and we prevailed. Here we stand looking out to the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream. Here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protestors tried to block brave women from marching for the right to vote. Today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office , Vice President Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things can't change. Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington National Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace. And here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive us from this sacred ground. That did not happen. It will never happen. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. To all those who supported our campaign I am humbled by the faith you have placed in us.

{"SpeechID":"VSJB2212021166","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2021-01-22","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Biden on the American Rescue Plan and Signing of Executive Orders","Type":"speech","RawText":"Good afternoon, folks. Vice President Harris and I just received a briefing from our economic team, and we remain in a once-in-a-century public health crisis that's led to the most unequal job and economic crisis in modern history. And the crisis is only deepening. It's not getting better; it's deepening. Yesterday, we learned that 900,000 more Americans filed for unemployment , 900,000. They join millions of Americans who, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. So many of them never thought they'd ever be out of work in the first place. And just like my dad did when he was , he used to lie awake at night when I was a kid, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep because he worried about whether or not he's about to lose his healthcare, or whether we were going to be , or have the money to pay the mortgage because of the economic circumstance he was in. And now, a lot of these folks are facing eviction, or waiting hours in their cars , literally hours in their cars, waiting to be able to feed their children as they drive up to a food bank. It's the United States of America and they're waiting to feed their kids. Folks who are able to still keep their job, many have seen their paychecks reduced, and they've , and they're barely hanging on, and wondering what's next. Sometimes the anxiety about what's going to happen next is more consequential than what actually happened. But this is happening today, in America, and this cannot be who we are as a country. These are not the values of our nation. We cannot, will not let people go hungry. We cannot let people be evicted because of nothing they did themselves. They cannot watch people lose their jobs. And we have to act. We have to act now. It's not just to meet the moral obligation to treat our fellow Americans with the dignity and respect they deserve; this is an economic imperative. A growing economic consensus that we must act decisively and boldly to grow the economy for all Americans, not just for tomorrow, but in the future. There's a growing chorus of top economic , top economists that agree that in this moment of crisis, with this , with the interest rates as low as they are , historic lows , it is smart fiscal investment, including deficit spending. And they're more urgent than ever. You know, and that return on these investments and jobs and racial equity is going to prevent long-term economic damage and benefits that are going to far surpass the cost. If we don't act, the rest of the world is not standing still, in terms of the competitive advantage and the competitive possibilities, relative to us. That our debt situation will be more stable and not less stable, according to these economists. And that such investments in our people is going to strengthen our economic competitiveness as a nation and help us outcompete our competitors in the global economy, because we're going to grow the economy with these investments. While the COVID-19 package that passed in December was a first step, as I said at the time, it's just a down payment. We need more action, and we need to move fast. Last week, I laid out a two-step plan of rescue and recovery to get through the crisis and to a better and stronger and more secure America. The first step of our American Rescue Plan is a plan to tackle the pandemic and get direct financial relief to Americans who need it the most. You know, in just a few days , it's just been a few days since I outlined this plan , it's received bipartisan support from a majority of American mayors and governors. Businesses and labor organizations have together welcomed it as an urgent action that's needed. Even Wall Street firms have underscored its importance. In fact, in a , an analysis by Moody's estimates that if we passed our America Rescue Plan, the economy would create 7.5 million jobs just in this year alone. That would be on the way to the more than 18 million , I think it was 18,600,000 jobs that they believe would be created over the four-year period, with our Build Back Better Recovery Plan. And with our America Rescue Plan, our economy would return to full employment a full year faster than without the plan. Even President Trump's , President Trump's now , not some liberal organization , Presidents Trump's top former economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said, quote, he \"absolutely is in favor\" of this rescue plan. This almost doesn't have a partisan piece to it. We're seeing the support because this plan takes a step that we so urgently need. More than just a step, a number of steps. It funds big parts of the COVID-19 National Strategy that I released yesterday , we released yesterday. Our national strategy puts on , us on a war footing to aggressively speed up our COVID-19 response, especially on vaccines and testing and reopening our schools. I found it fascinating , yesterday the press asked the question: Is, you know, 100 million enough? A week before, they were saying, \"Biden, are you crazy? You can't do 100 million in a hundred days.\" Well, we're going to, God willing, not only do 100 million, we're going to do more than that. But this is , we have to do this. We have to move. The American Rescue Plan also includes economic relief for most Americans who are in need. We're going to finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in direct payments to folks. Six hundred dollars, which was already passed, is simply not enough if you still have to choose between paying your rent and putting food on the table. We'll extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of workers, beyond the deadline that is now set. It means that 16 million Americans who are currently relying on unemployment benefits while they look for work can count on these checks continuing to be there in the middle of this crisis. The American Rescue Plan also addresses the growing housing crisis in America. Approximately 14 million Americans , 14 million , have fallen behind on rent, and many risk eviction. If we fail to act, there'll be a wave of evictions and foreclosures in the coming months as this pandemic rages on, because there's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months. So, look, this would overwhelm emergency shelters and increase COVID-19 infections as people have nowhere to go and are socially , can't socially distance. The American Rescue Plan asks Congress to provide rental assistance for millions of hard-hit families and tenants. This will also be a bridge to economic recovery for countless mom-and-pop landlords who can't afford not to have the rent. But they can't wait. So, on Inauguration Day, I directed my administration to extend nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures. These crises are straining the budgets of states and cities and in tribal communities that are forced to consider layoffs and service reductions among essential workers. Police officers, firefighters, first responders, nurses are all at the risk of losing their jobs. Over the last year, more than 600,000 educators have lost their jobs in the cities and towns. The American Rescue Plan will provide emergency funding to keep these essential workers on the job and maintain essential services. Look, it will also help small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth. When you say \"small business,\" most people think the major corporate entities are the ones that hire everybody. These small businesses are the glue that hold , and they're important , but these small businesses hold the community , are the glue that hold these communities together. They are hurting badly, and they account for nearly half of the entire U.S. workforce. Nearly half. Our rescue plan will provide flexible grants to help the hardest-hit small businesses survive the pandemic and low-cost capital to help entrepreneurs of all backgrounds create and maintain jobs, plus provide essential goods and services that communities so desperately depend on. Look, our recovery plan also calls for an increase in the minimum wage, at 15 , at least $15.00 an hour. No one in America should work 40 hours a week making below the poverty line. Fifteen dollars gets people above the poverty line. We have so many millions of people working 40 hours a week , working , and some with two jobs, and they're still below the poverty line. Our plan includes access to affordable childcare that's going to enable parents, particularly women, to get back to work , millions who are not working now because they don't have that care. All told, the American Rescue Plan would lift 12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half. That's 5 million children lifted out of poverty. Our plan would reduce poverty in the black community by one third and reduce poverty in the Hispanic community by almost 40 percent. I look forward to working with members of Congress of both parties to move quickly to get this American Rescue Plan to the American people. And then we can move with equal urgency and bipartisanship to the second step of our economic plan, the Build Back Better , the recovery plan. It's a plan that will make historic investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy, and so much more that's going to create millions more jobs , good-paying jobs, not minimum wage jobs. But while we work with members of both parties in the Congress, there are steps that we can and must take right now. For example, on Inauguration Day, I directed my administration to pause student loan repayments for interest for , the interest payments for Americans with federal student loans until at least September, so they're not going to have to pay until September. They still pay the bill, as it stands now, but they will not accrue interest, and they don't have to pay , begin to pay until September. And we may have to look beyond that, I might add. Today, I'm signing an executive order that directs the whole-of-government , a whole-of-government effort to help millions of Americans who are badly hurting. It requires all federal agencies to do what they can do to provide relief to families, small businesses, and communities. And in the days ahead, I expect agencies to act. Let me touch on two ways these actions can help change Americans lives. We need to tackle the growing hunger crisis in America. One in seven households in America , one in seven , more than one in five black and Latino households in America report they do not have enough food to eat. That includes nearly 30 million adults and as many as 12 million children. And again, they're in a spec- , in this situation through no fault of their own. It's unconscionable. The American Rescue Plan provides additional emergency food and nutrition assistance for tens of millions of children and families to address this crisis. But families literally can't wait another day. As a result of the executive order I'm going to shortly sign, the Department of Agriculture will consider taking immediate steps to make it easier for the hardest-hit families to enroll and claim more generous benefits in the critical food and nutrition assistance area. This is going to help tens of millions of families, especially those who can't provide meals for their kids, who are learning remotely at home, are not receiving the regular meal plans that they'd have at school for breakfast or lunch. It's going to also , and we also need to protect the health and safety of the American worker. Right now, approximately 40 percent of households in America have at least one member with a preexisting condition. Just imagine: You're out of work through no fault of your own. You file for unemployment while you're looking for a job. You find one, and you get an offer. But then you find out there's a high risk of you getting infected with COVID-19 because of your condition. You and your loved one , and you and your loved ones have ever even greater risk of death and serious illness because of the preexisting conditions, so you turn it down. Right now, if you did that, you could be denied unemployment insurance because you're offered a job and you didn't take it. It's wrong. No one should have to choose between their livelihoods and their own health or the health of their loved ones in the middle of a deadly pandemic. Because of the executive order I'm about to sign, I expect the Department of Labor to guarantee the right to refuse unemployment , the employment that will jeopardize your health, and if you do so, you'll still be able to qualify for the insurance. That's a judgment the Labor Department will make. Look, there are just two consequential ways that the action I'm taking today will help people in need. Another , another way to help approximately 2 million veterans maintain their financial footing: by pausing federal collections on overpayments and debts. Another makes sure that federal contractors are receiving taxpayer dollars, provide their workers with the pay and benefits they deserve. These are places where federal tax dollars are administered , are being made available to build things from ships to staircases. And we let out , the federal government lets the contract , and we're going to make sure that they buy American and are made in America. And here's another: Right now, there are up to 8 million people that are eligible for direct payments from the CARES Act and the relief bill passed in December. They are entitled to those payments, but there's not an easy way for those folks to assess , access them. So we're making it a priority today to fix that problem and get them relief they're entitled to. Look, I'm going to close and summarize this way: A lot of America is hurting. The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000. Families are going hungry. People are at risk of being evicted. Job losses are mounting again. We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act. If , if we act now, our economy will be stronger in both the short and long run. That's what economists , left, right, and center , are telling us, both liberal and conservative. We'll be better and stronger across the board. If we act now, we'll be better able to compete with the world. If we act now, we'll be better able to meet our moral obligations to one another as Americans. I don't believe the people of this country just want to stand by and watch their friends and their neighbors, coworkers, fellow Americans go hungry, lose their homes, or lose their sense of dignity and hope and respect. I don't believe that , especially in the middle of a pandemic that's so weakened and wrecked [sic] so much havoc and caused so much pain on America. That's not who we are. The bottom line is this: We're in a national emergency, and we need to act like we're in a national emergency. So we've got to move with everything we've got, and we've got to do it together. I don't believe Democrats or Republicans are going hungry and losing jobs; I believe Americans are going hungry and losing their jobs. And we have the tools to fix it. We have the tools to get through this. We have the tools to get this virus under control and our economy back on track. And we have the tools to help people. So let's use the tools, all of them. Use them now. So I'm going to sign this executive order, but let me conclude again by saying: Folks, this is one of the cases where business, labor, Wall Street, Main Street, liberal, conservative, economists know we have to act now, not only to help who are in need now, but to allow us to be in the competitive position worldwide and be the leader of the world economy in the next year, and two, and three, and going forward. So, thank you. I'm going to sign this executive order. The first one is the economic relief related to COVID-19 pandemic. (The executive order is signed.) The second one is protection , protecting the federal workforce. (The executive order is signed.) Thank you very much. Q Mr. President, do you support Mitch McConnell's timeline for a February impeachment trial? THE PRESIDENT: I haven't heard the detail of it, but I do think that having some time to get our administration up and running, we , they , I want to thank the Senate for passing our Secretary of Defense. It looks like our Secretary of Treasury, it looks like our Secretary of State is in place. So the more time we have to get up and running and meet these crises, the better.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1495239\/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-rescue-plan-and-signing-of-executive-orders&speechType=1","Summary":"Unemployed and Low-Income Employment and Affirmative Action Health and Health Care Food Processing and Sales","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/speeches-remarks\/2021\/01\/22\/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-rescue-plan-and-signing-of-executive-orders\/","CleanText":"Good afternoon, folks. Vice President Harris and I just received a briefing from our economic team, and we remain in a once-in-a-century public health crisis that's led to the most unequal job and economic crisis in modern history. And the crisis is only deepening. It's not getting better; it's deepening. Yesterday, we learned that 900,000 more Americans filed for unemployment , 900,000. They join millions of Americans who, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. So many of them never thought they'd ever be out of work in the first place. And just like my dad did when he was , he used to lie awake at night when I was a kid, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep because he worried about whether or not he's about to lose his healthcare, or whether we were going to be , or have the money to pay the mortgage because of the economic circumstance he was in. And now, a lot of these folks are facing eviction, or waiting hours in their cars , literally hours in their cars, waiting to be able to feed their children as they drive up to a food bank. It's the United States of America and they're waiting to feed their kids. Folks who are able to still keep their job, many have seen their paychecks reduced, and they've , and they're barely hanging on, and wondering what's next. Sometimes the anxiety about what's going to happen next is more consequential than what actually happened. But this is happening today, in America, and this cannot be who we are as a country. These are not the values of our nation. We cannot, will not let people go hungry. We cannot let people be evicted because of nothing they did themselves. They cannot watch people lose their jobs. And we have to act. We have to act now. It's not just to meet the moral obligation to treat our fellow Americans with the dignity and respect they deserve; this is an economic imperative. A growing economic consensus that we must act decisively and boldly to grow the economy for all Americans, not just for tomorrow, but in the future. There's a growing chorus of top economic , top economists that agree that in this moment of crisis, with this , with the interest rates as low as they are , historic lows , it is smart fiscal investment, including deficit spending. And they're more urgent than ever. You know, and that return on these investments and jobs and racial equity is going to prevent long-term economic damage and benefits that are going to far surpass the cost. If we don't act, the rest of the world is not standing still, in terms of the competitive advantage and the competitive possibilities, relative to us. That our debt situation will be more stable and not less stable, according to these economists. And that such investments in our people is going to strengthen our economic competitiveness as a nation and help us outcompete our competitors in the global economy, because we're going to grow the economy with these investments. While the COVID-19 package that passed in December was a first step, as I said at the time, it's just a down payment. We need more action, and we need to move fast. Last week, I laid out a two-step plan of rescue and recovery to get through the crisis and to a better and stronger and more secure America. The first step of our American Rescue Plan is a plan to tackle the pandemic and get direct financial relief to Americans who need it the most. You know, in just a few days , it's just been a few days since I outlined this plan , it's received bipartisan support from a majority of American mayors and governors. Businesses and labor organizations have together welcomed it as an urgent action that's needed. Even Wall Street firms have underscored its importance. In fact, in a , an analysis by Moody's estimates that if we passed our America Rescue Plan, the economy would create 7.5 million jobs just in this year alone. That would be on the way to the more than 18 million , I think it was 18,600,000 jobs that they believe would be created over the four-year period, with our Build Back Better Recovery Plan. And with our America Rescue Plan, our economy would return to full employment a full year faster than without the plan. Even President Trump's , President Trump's now , not some liberal organization , Presidents Trump's top former economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said, quote, he 'absolutely is in favor' of this rescue plan. This almost doesn't have a partisan piece to it. We're seeing the support because this plan takes a step that we so urgently need. More than just a step, a number of steps. It funds big parts of the COVID-19 National Strategy that I released yesterday , we released yesterday. Our national strategy puts on , us on a war footing to aggressively speed up our COVID-19 response, especially on vaccines and testing and reopening our schools. I found it fascinating , yesterday the press asked the question: Is, you know, 100 million enough? A week before, they were saying, 'Biden, are you crazy? You can't do 100 million in a hundred days.' Well, we're going to, God willing, not only do 100 million, we're going to do more than that. But this is , we have to do this. We have to move. The American Rescue Plan also includes economic relief for most Americans who are in need. We're going to finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in direct payments to folks. Six hundred dollars, which was already passed, is simply not enough if you still have to choose between paying your rent and putting food on the table. We'll extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of workers, beyond the deadline that is now set. It means that 16 million Americans who are currently relying on unemployment benefits while they look for work can count on these checks continuing to be there in the middle of this crisis. The American Rescue Plan also addresses the growing housing crisis in America. Approximately 14 million Americans , 14 million , have fallen behind on rent, and many risk eviction. If we fail to act, there'll be a wave of evictions and foreclosures in the coming months as this pandemic rages on, because there's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months. So, look, this would overwhelm emergency shelters and increase COVID-19 infections as people have nowhere to go and are socially , can't socially distance. The American Rescue Plan asks Congress to provide rental assistance for millions of hard-hit families and tenants. This will also be a bridge to economic recovery for countless mom-and-pop landlords who can't afford not to have the rent. But they can't wait. So, on Inauguration Day, I directed my administration to extend nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures. These crises are straining the budgets of states and cities and in tribal communities that are forced to consider layoffs and service reductions among essential workers. Police officers, firefighters, first responders, nurses are all at the risk of losing their jobs. Over the last year, more than 600,000 educators have lost their jobs in the cities and towns. The American Rescue Plan will provide emergency funding to keep these essential workers on the job and maintain essential services. Look, it will also help small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth. When you say 'small business,' most people think the major corporate entities are the ones that hire everybody. These small businesses are the glue that hold , and they're important , but these small businesses hold the community , are the glue that hold these communities together. They are hurting badly, and they account for nearly half of the entire U.S. workforce. Nearly half. Our rescue plan will provide flexible grants to help the hardest-hit small businesses survive the pandemic and low-cost capital to help entrepreneurs of all backgrounds create and maintain jobs, plus provide essential goods and services that communities so desperately depend on. Look, our recovery plan also calls for an increase in the minimum wage, at 15 , at least $15.00 an hour. No one in America should work 40 hours a week making below the poverty line. Fifteen dollars gets people above the poverty line. We have so many millions of people working 40 hours a week , working , and some with two jobs, and they're still below the poverty line. Our plan includes access to affordable childcare that's going to enable parents, particularly women, to get back to work , millions who are not working now because they don't have that care. All told, the American Rescue Plan would lift 12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half. That's 5 million children lifted out of poverty. Our plan would reduce poverty in the black community by one third and reduce poverty in the Hispanic community by almost 40 percent. I look forward to working with members of Congress of both parties to move quickly to get this American Rescue Plan to the American people. And then we can move with equal urgency and bipartisanship to the second step of our economic plan, the Build Back Better , the recovery plan. It's a plan that will make historic investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy, and so much more that's going to create millions more jobs , good-paying jobs, not minimum wage jobs.

{"SpeechID":"VSJB2512021164","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2021-01-25","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Biden at Signing of Executive Order on Strengthening American Manufacturing","Type":"speech","RawText":"Good afternoon, folks. I'm going to make some brief remarks, sign an executive order, and then take your questions, if that's okay with you all. Last week, we immediately got to work to contain the pandemic and deliver economic relief to millions of Americans who need it the most. And today we're getting to work to rebuild the backbone of America: manufacturing, unions, and the middle class. It's based on a simple premise: that we'll reward work, not wealth, in this country. And the key plank of ensuring the future will be \"Made in America.\" I've long said that I don't accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization can't keep , can keep union jobs from growing here in America. We can create more of them, not fewer of them. I don't buy for one second the , that the vitality of the American manufacturing is a thing of the past. American manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in World War Two, and it must be part of the engine of American prosperity now. That means we are going to use taxpayers' money to rebuild America. We'll buy American products and support American jobs, union jobs. For example, the federal government every year spends approximately $600 billion in government procurement to keep the country going safe and secure. And there's a law that's been on the books for almost a century now: to make sure that that money was spent , taxpayers' dollars for procurement is spent to support American jobs and American businesses. But the previous administration didn't take it seriously enough. Federal agencies waived the Buy American requirement without much pushback at all. Big corporations and special interests have long fought for loopholes to redirect American taxpayers' dollars to foreign companies where the products are being made. The result: tens of billions of American taxpayers' dollars supporting foreign jobs and foreign industries. In 1918 , excuse me, in 2018 alone, the Department spent $3 billion , the Defense Department , on foreign construction contracts, leaving American steel and iron out in the cold. It spent nearly $300 million in foreign engines and on vehicles instead of buying American vehicles and engines from American companies, putting Americans to work. Under the previous administration, the federal government contract awarded directly to foreign companies went up 30 percent. That is going to change on our watch. Today I'm taking the first steps in my larger Build Back Better Recovery Plan that invests in American workers, unions, and businesses up and down the supply chain. And I know that previous presidents entered office by promising to buy America and instituting the Buy American policy, but here's why this is different and not the same: I'll be signing an executive order in just a moment, tightening the existing Buy American policies, and go further. We're setting clear directives and clear explanations. We're going to get to the core issue with a centralized, coordinated effort. Look, today I'm creating a director of Made in America at the White House Office of Management and Budget who will oversee our all-of-government Made in America initiative. That starts with stopping federal agencies from waiving Buy American requirements with impunity, as has been going on. If an agency wants to issue a waiver to say \"We're not going to buy an American product as part of this project; we're going to buy a foreign product,\" they have to come to the White House and explain it to us. We're going to require that waivers be publicly posted; that is, if someone is seeking a waiver to build this particular vehicle or facility and is going to buy the following foreign parts, that waiver , the request for it , is going to be posted. Then we'll work with small American manufacturers and businesses to give them a shot to raise their hand and say, \"Yeah, I can do that here in my shop, in my town.\" It's about , as you've heard me say before, I used to have a friend who was a great athlete, who'd say, \"You got to know how to know.\" These small businesses don't even know they can compete for making the product that is attempting to be waived and being able to be bought abroad. And I'm directing the Office of Management and Budget to review waivers to make sure they are only used in very limited circumstances. For example, when there's an overwhelming national security, humanitarian, or emergency need here in America. This hasn't happened before. It will happen now. Here's what else we're going to be doing. Under the Build Back Better Recovery Plan, we'll invest hundreds of billions of dollars in buying American products and materials to modernize our infrastructure, and our competitive strength will increase in a competitive world. That means millions of good-paying jobs, using American-made steel and technology, to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our ports, and to make them more climate resilient, as well as making them able to move faster and cheaper and cleaner to transport American-made goods across the country and around the world, making us more competitive.It also means replenishing our stockpiles to enhance our national security. As this pandemic has made clear, we can never again be in a position where we have to rely on a foreign country that doesn't share our interest in order to protect our people during a national emergency. We need to make our own protective equipment, essential products and supplies. And we'll work with our allies to make sure they have resilient supply chains as well. We'll also make historic investments in research and development , hundreds of billions of dollars , to sharpen America's innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs , markets like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, clean energy. The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we're going to replace with clean, electric vehicles made right here in America by American workers, creating millions of jobs , a million autoworker jobs in clean energy , and vehicles that are net-zero emissions.And together, this will be the largest mobilization of public investment in procurement, infrastructure, and R&D since World War Two. And with the executive order I'll be signing today, we'll increase Buy American requirements for these kinds of projects and improve the way we measure domestic content requirements. For example, right now, if you manufacture a vehicle for the federal government, you need to show that at least 50 percent of the components of that vehicle were made in America. But because of loopholes that have been expanded over time, you can count the least valuable possible parts as part of that 50 percent to say \"Made in America,\" while the most valuable parts , the engines, the steel, the glass, the manufac- , are manufactured abroad. So basically , but basically we're batting zero for two. The content threshold of 50 percent aren't high enough. And the way we measure the content doesn't account for U.S. jobs and economic activity. We're going to change that as well.The executive action I'm signing today will not only require that companies make more of their components in America, but that the value of those components is contributing to our economy, measured by things like a number of American jobs created and\/or supported. At the same time, we'll be committed to working with our trading partners to modernize international trade rules, including those relating to government procurement, to make sure we can use , we can all use our taxpayer dollars to spur investment that promotes growth and resilient supply chains.And here's what else the action does. When we buy America, we'll buy from all of America. That includes communities that have historically been left out of government procurement , black, brown, Native American small businesses and entrepreneurs in every region of the country. We will use a national network of manufacturers , called a Manufacturing Extension Partnership , that's in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, to help government agency connect with new domestic suppliers across the country. This is a critical piece of building our economy back better and including everyone in the deal this time, especially small businesses that are badly hurting in this economy. The executive action I am taking also reiterates my strong support for the Jones Act and American vessels, you know, and our ports, especially those important for America's clean energy future and the development of offshore renewable energy. I'll close with this: The reason we need to do this is America can't sit on the sidelines in the race for the future.Our competitors aren't waiting. To ensure the future is made in America, we need to win not just the jobs of today, but the jobs and industries of tomorrow. And we know that the middle class built this country, and we also know unions built the middle class. So let's invest in them once again. I know we're ready, despite all of the , all we're facing. I have never been more optimistic about the future of America than I am today. Given even just half a chance, the American people,the American worker, has never, ever let the country down. Imagine if we give them a full chance. That's what we're going to do. I'll stop here and sign the executive order, and then come back and take some of your questions. This executive order is entitled \"Ensuring the Future Is Made in America, by Americans , All of American Workers.\" (The executive order is signed). There you go. Now I'd now be happy to take your questions. Q Thank you, Mr. President. Jonathan Lemire with the Associated Press. Two topics, if I may. The first: You have made reopening schools a central part of your first 100 Days agenda, and you've long portrayed yourself as an ally to the teachers and the unions. Right now, the Chicago Teachers Union has refused. They defied an order to return to in-person classing , for in-person classrooms because of a lack of vaccinations. Do you believe, sir, that teachers should return to schools now? THE PRESIDENT: I believe we should make school classrooms safe and secure for the students, for the teachers, and for the help that's in those schools maintaining the facilities. We need new ventilation systems in those schools. We need testing for people coming in and out of the classes. We need testing for teachers, as well as students. And we need the capacity , the capacity to know that, in fact, the cic- [sic] , or the circumstance in the school is safe and secure for everyone. For example, there is no reason why the clear guidance will be that every school should be thoroughly sanitized, from the lavatories to the hallways. And so this is about making , and none of the school districts that I'm aware of , there may be some, of public school districts , have insisted that all of those pieces be in place. And, I might add, it's the same kind of thing I hope we can do with small businesses and businesses, making sure they have the capacity to test their workers when they come in; to make sure they have plastic dividers between their booths in their , in their restaurants, et cetera; to make sure they can sanitize. So it's not so much about the idea that teachers aren't going to work. The teachers I know, they want to work. They just want to work in a safe environment and as safe as we can rationally make it. And we can do that, and we should be able to open up every , every school, kindergarten through eighth grade, if, in fact, we administer these tests. And it'll have the added advantage, I might add, of putting millions of people back to work , all those mothers and fathers that are home taking care of their children, rather than go to work. Even when they can work, they're not able to do it unless they have the luxury of working distance-wise, like many of us do. They're not able to do it. And so this is about generating economic growth overall as well. WHITE HOUSE AIDE: Great. Alex from Reuters. Q Thank you, Mr. President. I'm Alex Alper from Reuters. I wanted to ask a question about Navalny , if you are considering imposing sanctions on any of the individuals involved in his attempted poisoning and\/or his arrest when he returned from Germany. And if not, is that related to your concerns about it potentially derailing a New START extension? Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: I find that we can both operate in the mutual self-interest of our countries as a New START agreement, and make it clear to Russia that we are , we are very concerned about their behavior, whether it's Navalny, whether it's the SolarWinds, or whether it's the reports of bounties on the heads of Americans in Afghanistan. I have asked the agencies in question to do a thorough , a thorough read for me on every one of those issues, to update me on precisely where they are. And I will not hesitate to raise those issues with the Russians. WHITE HOUSE AIDE: Jeff from NBC. Q President Biden, Vice President Harris, a question about your COVID relief deal. On Friday, you said the nation is \"in a national emergency [and] we should act like it.\" Given that , given the scale and the severity of the need, how long are you willing to get sufficient Republican support before you would greenlight Democrat attempts to use reconciliation, for instance, to pass that bill? THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the decision on reconciliation will be one made by the leaders of the House and the Senate. But here's the deal: I have been doing legislative negotiations for a large part of my life. I know how the system works. And what I'm not , I can't guarantee anything at all, but I can say that what I'm going to be doing , and we've already begun , is making it clear to the leadership in the House and the Senate, as well as the , the group of 16, the group , the bipartisan group, as well as Republican individuals who have an interest in the issues that are in package, and saying \"Here's what I'm doing, and here's why I want to do it, here's why I think we need to do it, and what kind of support can or can't you give to that?\" And then we go on to the way in which we deal with legislation all the time. You know, we , we didn't have any votes for the recovery package when Barack and I came into office. We were short three votes. We didn't know we had the votes until the day of the , the day of the , of the , bringing it up. And , but here's the deal: You know, it's interesting , and I know you ask a lot of these questions. You know the answers, but you have to , to help educate the public as well; I'm not suggesting you don't know what I'm about to say. No one wants to give up on their position until there's no other alternative. They either have to make a decision that they don't do what , they don't support what is being proposed, or they insist on what they have, or they let it all go away, fall down. I think we're far from that point right now. The decision to use reconciliation will depend upon how these negotiations go. And let me make clear about negotiations: I've always believed part of negotiation , on the part of a President and\/or a chairman of a committee trying to get a major piece of legislation passed , is about consultation. It's not enough for me just to come up to you and say, \"I like this. I expect you to support it.\" I want to explain to you why I think it's so important in this package that we have to provide for money for additional vaccines, why I think it's so important why we provide for money to extend unemployment benefits, why I think it's so important that we provide money to provide for the ability of people not to be thrown out of their apartments during this pandemic because they can't afford their rent, and to make the case to you why I think and what I think the priorities within this piece , that we think the priorities are , I apologize , were within this legislation. And I don't expect we'll know whether we have an agreement or to what extent the entire package will be able to pass or not pass until we get right down to the very end of this process, which will be probably in a couple of weeks. But the point is, this is just the process beginning. WHITE HOUSE AIDE: Annie, the Washington Post. Q Thank you, Mr. President, Annie Linskey with the Washington Post. THE PRESIDENT: Hi, Annie. Q I wanted to ask you a little bit about one of the, sort of, major themes of your campaign, and how you sort of intend to measure and enact it , and that is the idea of unity. If you could talk a little bit about what you see unity as being? There are some people who are defining it as being bipartisan. Others are saying it is what most of the people in the country, defined by some poll, might believe, or any sort of number of other , or perhaps it's 50 plus 1, or 50 plus 2, or 75 percent. So, given that it is such a key part of your message and your promise, can you talk and reflect a little bit more about what is unity when you see it and as you define it? THE PRESIDENT: Well, Annie, I think it makes up several of the issues , the points you made. One is: Unity requires you to take away , eliminate the vitriol, make anything that you disagree with about the other person's personality or their lack of integrity or they're not decent legislators and the like , so we have to get rid of that. And I think that's already beginning to change, but God knows where things go, number one. Unity also is: trying to reflect what the majority of the American people , Democrat, Republican, and independent , think is within the fulcrum of what needs to be done to make their lives and the lives of Americans better. For example, if you look at the data , and I'm not claiming the polling data to be exact, but if you look at the data, you have , I think it's , I hope I'm saying this correct , you may correct me if I get the number wrong, I think it's 57, 58 percent of the American people , including Republicans, Democrats, and independents , think that we have to do something about the COVID vaccine; we have to do something about making sure that people who are hurting badly, can't eat, don't have food, are in a position where they're about to be thrown out of their apartments, et cetera, being able to have an opportunity to get a job , that they all think we should be acting, we should be doing more. Unity also is trying to get, at a minimum , if you pass a piece of legislation that breaks down on party lines but it gets passed, it doesn't mean there wasn't unity; it just means it wasn't bipartisan. I'd prefer these things to be bipartisan, because I'm trying to generate some consensus and take sort of the , how can I say it? , the vitriol out of all of this. Because I'm confident , I'm confident, from my discussions, there are a number of Republicans who know we have to do something about the food insecurity for people in this pandemic. I'm confident they know we have to do something about figuring out how to get children back in school. There's just , there's easy ways to deal with this. One, if you're anti-union, you can say it's all because of teachers. If you want to make a case though that it's complicated, you say, \"Well, what do you have to do to make it safe to get in those schools?\" And we're going to have arguments. For example, you know I proposed that we , because it was bipartisan, I thought it would increase the prospects of passage , the additional $1,400 in direct cash payment to folks. Well, there's legitimate reason for people to say, \"Do you have the lines drawn the exact right way? Should it go to anybody making over X-number of dollars or why?\" I'm open to negotiate those things. That's all. I picked it because I thought it was rational, reasonable, and it had overwhelming bipartisan support in the House when it passed. But this is all a bit of a moving target in terms of the precision with which this goes. You're asking about unity: 51 votes, bipartisan, et cetera. The other piece of this is that the one thing that gives me hope that we're not only going to, sort of, stay away from the ad hominem attacks on one another, is that there is an overwhelming consensus among the major economists at home and in the world that the way to avoid a deeper, deeper, deeper recession, moving in the direction of losing our competitive capacity, is to spend money now to , from , from across the board, every major institution has said, \"If we don't invest now, we're going to lose so much altitude, in terms of our employment base and our economic growth, it's going to be harder to reestablish it.\" We can afford to do it now. As a matter of fact, the , I think the response has been, \"We can't afford not to invest now. We can't afford to fail to invest now.\" And I think there's a growing realization of that on the part of all but some very, very hard-edged partisans, maybe on both sides, but I think there is a growing consensus. Whether we get it all done exactly the way I want it remains to be seen, but I'm confident that we can work our way through. We have to work our way through because, as I've said 100 times, there is no ability in a democracy for it to function without the ability to reach consensus. Other- , otherwise it just becomes executive fiat or battleground issues that are , get us virtually nowhere. I don't want to hold the , my colleague may know, the Vice President , but, you know, I think there were very few debates on the Senate floor the whole last year , THE VICE PRESIDENT: That's correct. THE PRESIDENT: , on almost any issue. Well, that benefits no one. It doesn't inform anybody. It doesn't allow the public to make judgments about who they think is right or wrong. So I am , I am optimistic that it may take some time, but over the year, the way , if we treat each other with respect , and we're going to argue like hell. I'm confident of that. Believe me, I know that. I've been there. But I think we can do it in a way that we can get things done for the American people. WHITE HOUSE AIDE: Great. Last question. Josh from Bloomberg. Q Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Josh, they don't trust you with the mic, huh? I don't know, man. Q No, that's fine. I wouldn't either. (Laughter.) Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate you taking the questions. You mentioned just now that you might know in a couple of weeks. Can I ask whether it's more important for you to get something passed in a short timeframe like that or would you be willing to wait longer to get more bipartisan support? And might I also ask that , one of the pillars is the vaccine funding , when do you think any American who wants to get the shot will be able to get the shot? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'll try to answer the three parts to your question as I heard them. One, time is of the essence. Time is of the essence. And I must tell you, I'm reluctant to cherry pick and take out one or two items here, and then have to go through it again to , because these all are kind of , they go, sort of, hand in glove, each of these issues. Number one. Number two, we are optimistic that we will have enough vaccine and in very short order. We, as you know, we came in office without knowledge of how much vaccine was held , being held in abeyance or available. Now that we're here , we've been around a week or so , we now have that. And we've gotten commitments from some of the producers that they will, in fact, produce more vaccine in a relatively short period of time and then continue that down the road. So I'm quite confident that we will be in a position, within the next three weeks or so, to be vaccinating people at the range of a million a day or in excess of that. That is my , I promised that we would get at least 100 million vaccinations , that's not people, because sometimes you need more than one shot of the vaccination. But 100,000 , 100 million shots in people's arms of the vaccine. I think, with the grace of God, and the goodwill of the neighbor, and the creek not rising, as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to get that to 150 thou- , 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day. But we have to meet that goal of a million a day. And everything points that we're going to have: A, the , enough vaccine; B, enough syringes and all the paraphernalia needed to store, keep, inject, move into your arm the vaccine; three, a number of vaccinators, people administering the vaccine, which is not an easy task of those who have , those facilities, like the nursing homes and hospitals , they have people do it, but they don't have the capacity to do everyone. And so I think we're going to have , we're leaning hard on , into areas where we can produce more vaccinators. We feel confident we can do that. And thirdly, it's really important that we have the fora, the place, the facility, the circumstance where people can show up, stand in line, and get their vaccine without having to stand in line for eight hours , being able to pick up the phone, call the pharmacy, and get your name on the list, et cetera. All those mechanical things are really , they sound simple, but they're all consequential when we're trying to get out a minimum of 100 million vaccinations in 100 days and move in the direction where we are well beyond that in the next 100 days so we can get to the point where we reach herd immunity in a country of over 300 million people. Did that answer your question? Q Well, my question was at what date , or, roughly, when do you think anyone who wants one would be able to get it? Summer? Is it (inaudible)? THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I , no, I think it'll be this spring. I think we'll be able to do that this spring. And , but it's going to be a logistical challenge that exceeds anything we've ever tried in this country, but I think we can do that. I feel confident that, by summer, we're going to be well on our way to heading toward herd immunity and increasing the access for people who aren't on the first , aren't on the list, all the way going down to children and how we deal with that. But I feel good about where we're going, and I think we can get it done. WHITE HOUSE AIDE: Thank you, guys. Q One more. One more on vaccines. Mr. President, one more on vaccines. THE PRESIDENT: Now, wait, wait, wait. I know he always asks me tough questions, and he always has an edge to them, but I like him anyway. So go ahead and answer , ask the question. Q Thank you, Mr. President. So you just said that you think within three weeks or so we'll be at the point where there are a million vaccines per day, but it seems like , THE PRESIDENT: No, I think we'll get there before that. I said, \"I hope \" , I misspoke. I hope we'll be able to increase as we go on until we get to the million-five a day. That's my ex- , my hope. Q And then my , the follow-up to that would be: Now that you're President and you're saying, \"There is nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months,\" what happened to two months ago when you were talking declaratively about \"I'm going to shut down the virus\"? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm going to shut down the virus, but not , I never said I'd do it in two months. I said it took a long time to get here; it's going take a long time to beat it. And so we have millions of people out there who are , who have the virus. We're just, for the first day, I think , correct me if I'm wrong; I've been doing other things this morning, speaking with foreign leaders. But one of the things , I think this is one of the first days that the number has actually come down , the number of deaths , and the number on a daily basis, and the number of hospitalizations, et cetera. It's going to take time. It's going to take a heck of a lot of time. And we still have , as Dr. Fauci constantly points out, it's one thing when we have mass , how can I say it politely? , mass disregard of the warnings about not wearing masks and wearing masks, and social distancing and failure to social distance, and people getting together on holidays in ways that weren't recommended, et cetera. We see , the first thing that happens is we see the number of infections go up. Then you see the hospitalizations go up. Then you see the deaths go up. And so we're in this for a while. I mean, we're , what are we now? At about 410,000 deaths. And there's going to be more. The prediction, as I said from the very beginning to getting here as , after being sworn in, was , the predictions were: We're going to see somewhere between a total of 600,000 and 660,000 deaths before we begin to turn the corner in a major way. So , and again, remember: The vaccine , most of the people taking the vaccine , a vast, significant number , required two shots, and they're an average of three weeks apart. And it takes time for it to be sure that you're , you get to that 95 percent assurance rate. And so it's beginning to move. But I'm confident we will beat this. We will beat this. But we're still going to be talking about this in the summer. We're still going to be dealing with this issue in the , in early fall. And last point I'll make , and I know you're tired of hearing me saying it, particularly , you may be tired of me saying it. (Laughs.) And that is that if we wear masks between now and the end of April, the experts tell us we can save 50,000 lives , 50,000 people who otherwise would die. Thank you so very much.

I'm going to make some brief remarks, sign an executive order, and then take your questions, if that's okay with you all. Last week, we immediately got to work to contain the pandemic and deliver economic relief to millions of Americans who need it the most. And today we're getting to work to rebuild the backbone of America: manufacturing, unions, and the middle class. It's based on a simple premise: that we'll reward work, not wealth, in this country. And the key plank of ensuring the future will be 'Made in America.' I've long said that I don't accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization can't keep , can keep union jobs from growing here in America. We can create more of them, not fewer of them. I don't buy for one second the , that the vitality of the American manufacturing is a thing of the past. American manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in World War Two, and it must be part of the engine of American prosperity now. That means we are going to use taxpayers' money to rebuild America. We'll buy American products and support American jobs, union jobs. For example, the federal government every year spends approximately $600 billion in government procurement to keep the country going safe and secure. And there's a law that's been on the books for almost a century now: to make sure that that money was spent , taxpayers' dollars for procurement is spent to support American jobs and American businesses. But the previous administration didn't take it seriously enough. Federal agencies waived the Buy American requirement without much pushback at all. Big corporations and special interests have long fought for loopholes to redirect American taxpayers' dollars to foreign companies where the products are being made. The result: tens of billions of American taxpayers' dollars supporting foreign jobs and foreign industries. In 1918 , excuse me, in 2018 alone, the Department spent $3 billion , the Defense Department , on foreign construction contracts, leaving American steel and iron out in the cold. It spent nearly $300 million in foreign engines and on vehicles instead of buying American vehicles and engines from American companies, putting Americans to work. Under the previous administration, the federal government contract awarded directly to foreign companies went up 30 percent. That is going to change on our watch. Today I'm taking the first steps in my larger Build Back Better Recovery Plan that invests in American workers, unions, and businesses up and down the supply chain. And I know that previous presidents entered office by promising to buy America and instituting the Buy American policy, but here's why this is different and not the same: I'll be signing an executive order in just a moment, tightening the existing Buy American policies, and go further. We're setting clear directives and clear explanations. We're going to get to the core issue with a centralized, coordinated effort. Look, today I'm creating a director of Made in America at the White House Office of Management and Budget who will oversee our all-of-government Made in America initiative. That starts with stopping federal agencies from waiving Buy American requirements with impunity, as has been going on. If an agency wants to issue a waiver to say 'We're not going to buy an American product as part of this project; we're going to buy a foreign product,' they have to come to the White House and explain it to us. We're going to require that waivers be publicly posted; that is, if someone is seeking a waiver to build this particular vehicle or facility and is going to buy the following foreign parts, that waiver , the request for it , is going to be posted. Then we'll work with small American manufacturers and businesses to give them a shot to raise their hand and say, 'Yeah, I can do that here in my shop, in my town.' It's about , as you've heard me say before, I used to have a friend who was a great athlete, who'd say, 'You got to know how to know.' These small businesses don't even know they can compete for making the product that is attempting to be waived and being able to be bought abroad. And I'm directing the Office of Management and Budget to review waivers to make sure they are only used in very limited circumstances. For example, when there's an overwhelming national security, humanitarian, or emergency need here in America. This hasn't happened before. It will happen now. Here's what else we're going to be doing. Under the Build Back Better Recovery Plan, we'll invest hundreds of billions of dollars in buying American products and materials to modernize our infrastructure, and our competitive strength will increase in a competitive world. That means millions of good-paying jobs, using American-made steel and technology, to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our ports, and to make them more climate resilient, as well as making them able to move faster and cheaper and cleaner to transport American-made goods across the country and around the world, making us more competitive.It also means replenishing our stockpiles to enhance our national security. As this pandemic has made clear, we can never again be in a position where we have to rely on a foreign country that doesn't share our interest in order to protect our people during a national emergency. We need to make our own protective equipment, essential products and supplies. And we'll work with our allies to make sure they have resilient supply chains as well. We'll also make historic investments in research and development , hundreds of billions of dollars , to sharpen America's innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs , markets like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, clean energy. The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we're going to replace with clean, electric vehicles made right here in America by American workers, creating millions of jobs , a million autoworker jobs in clean energy , and vehicles that are net-zero emissions.And together, this will be the largest mobilization of public investment in procurement, infrastructure, and R&D since World War Two. And with the executive order I'll be signing today, we'll increase Buy American requirements for these kinds of projects and improve the way we measure domestic content requirements. For example, right now, if you manufacture a vehicle for the federal government, you need to show that at least 50 percent of the components of that vehicle were made in America. But because of loopholes that have been expanded over time, you can count the least valuable possible parts as part of that 50 percent to say 'Made in America,' while the most valuable parts , the engines, the steel, the glass, the manufac- , are manufactured abroad. So basically , but basically we're batting zero for two. The content threshold of 50 percent aren't high enough. And the way we measure the content doesn't account for U.S. jobs and economic activity. We're going to change that as well.The executive action I'm signing today will not only require that companies make more of their components in America, but that the value of those components is contributing to our economy, measured by things like a number of American jobs created and\/or supported. At the same time, we'll be committed to working with our trading partners to modernize international trade rules, including those relating to government procurement, to make sure we can use , we can all use our taxpayer dollars to spur investment that promotes growth and resilient supply chains.And here's what else the action does. When we buy America, we'll buy from all of America. That includes communities that have historically been left out of government procurement , black, brown, Native American small businesses and entrepreneurs in every region of the country. We will use a national network of manufacturers , called a Manufacturing Extension Partnership , that's in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, to help government agency connect with new domestic suppliers across the country. This is a critical piece of building our economy back better and including everyone in the deal this time, especially small businesses that are badly hurting in this economy. The executive action I am taking also reiterates my strong support for the Jones Act and American vessels, you know, and our ports, especially those important for America's clean energy future and the development of offshore renewable energy. I'll close with this: The reason we need to do this is America can't sit on the sidelines in the race for the future.Our competitors aren't waiting. To ensure the future is made in America, we need to win not just the jobs of today, but the jobs and industries of tomorrow. And we know that the middle class built this country, and we also know unions built the middle class. So let's invest in them once again. I know we're ready, despite all of the , all we're facing. I have never been more optimistic about the future of America than I am today. Given even just half a chance, the American people,the American worker, has never, ever let the country down. Imagine if we give them a full chance. That's what we're going to do. I'll stop here and sign the executive order, and then come back and take some of your questions. This executive order is entitled 'Ensuring the Future Is Made in America, by Americans , All of American Workers.' (The executive order is signed). There you go. Now I'd now be happy to take your questions."}

The national emergency caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States continues to pose a grave threat to our health and security. As of January 20, 2021, the United States had experienced more than 24 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 400,000 COVID-19 deaths. It is the policy of my Administration to implement science-based public health measures, across all areas of the Federal Government, to prevent further spread of the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), within the Department of Health and Human Services, working in close coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, has determined that the Republic of South Africa is experiencing widespread, ongoing person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including a variant strain of the virus known as B.1.351. The World Health Organization has reported that the Republic of South Africa has over 1,400,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Another variant strain, known as B.1.1.7, is widely circulating and has been traced to the United Kingdom. Furthermore, a third variant strain, which is known as B.1.1.28.1 and may impact the potential for re-infection, has been identified in Brazil. Based on developments with respect to the variants and the continued spread of the disease, CDC has reexamined its policies on international travel and, after reviewing the public health situations within the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), the Republic of Ireland, the Federative Republic of Brazil, and the Republic of South Africa, has concluded that continued and further measures are required to protect the public health from travelers entering the United States from those jurisdictions. In my Executive Order of January 21, 2021, entitled \"Promoting COVID-19 Safety in Domestic and International Travel,\" I directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Director of CDC, and in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation (including through the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration) and the Secretary of Homeland Security (including through the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration), to further examine certain current public health precautions for international travel and take additional appropriate regulatory action, to the extent feasible and consistent with CDC guidelines and applicable law. While that review continues, and given the determination of CDC, working in close coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, described above, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of noncitizens of the United States (\"noncitizens\") who were physically present within the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), the Republic of Ireland, the Federative Republic of Brazil, and the Republic of South Africa during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following: Section 1. Suspension and Limitation on Entry. (a) The entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of noncitizens who were physically present within the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), the Republic of Ireland, and the Federative Republic of Brazil during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States, is hereby suspended and limited subject to section 2 of this proclamation.(b) The entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of noncitizens who were physically present within the Republic of South Africa during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States, is hereby suspended and limited subject to section 2 of this proclamation.Sec. 2.

(d) Where a noncitizen circumvents the application of this proclamation through fraud, willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or illegal entry, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consider prioritizing such noncitizen for removal. Sec. 4. Termination. This proclamation shall remain in effect until terminated by the President. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, as circumstances warrant and no more than 30 days after the date of this proclamation and by the final day of each calendar month thereafter, recommend whether the President should continue, modify, or terminate this proclamation.

{"SpeechID":"VSJB2612021162","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2021-01-26","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Biden at Signing of an Executive Order on Racial Equity","Type":"speech","RawText":"Good afternoon, folks. I thank the Vice President for being with me today as well. In my campaign for President, I made it very clear that the moment had arrived as a nation where we face deep racial inequities in America and system- , systemic racism that has plagued our nation for far, far too long. I said it over the course of the past year that the blinders had been taken come off the nation of the American people. What ma- , what many Americans didn't see,or had simply refused to see, couldn't be ignored any longer. Those 8 minutes and 46 seconds that took George Floyd's life opened the eyes of millions of Americans and millions of people around , all over the world. It was the knee on the neck of justice, and it wouldn't be forgotten. It stirred the conscience of tens of millions of Americans, and, in my view, it marked a turning point in this country's attitude toward racial justice. When his six-years-old , six-year-old daughter, Gianna, who I met with when I met with the family , I leaned down to say hi to her, and she said , looked at me, and she said, \"Daddy changed the world.\" That's what Gianna said , his daughter. \"Daddy changed the world.\" And I believe she is right, not because this kind of injustice stopped , it clearly hasn't , but because the ground has shifted, because it's changed minds and mindsets, because it laid the groundwork for progress. COVID-19 has further ripped a path of destruction through every community in America, but no one has been spared, but the devastation in communities of color has been nothing short of stunning. Just look at the numbers: 40 percent of frontline workers , nurses, first responders, grocery store workers , are Americans of color, and many are still living on the edge. One in ten black Americans is out of work today. One in eleven Latino Americans is out of work today. One in seven households in America , about one in four black, one in five Latino households in America , report that they don't have enough food to eat in the United States of America. Black and Latino Americans are dying of COVID-19 at rates nearly three times that of white Americans. And it's not white Americans' fault, but it's just a fact. And the Americans now know it, especially younger Americans. One of the reasons I'm so optimistic about this nation is that today's generation of young Americans is the most progressive, thoughtful, inclusive generation that America has ever seen. And they are pulling us toward justice in so many ways, forcing us to confront the huge gap in economi- , excuse me, economic inequity between those at the top and everyone else, forcing us to confront the existential crisis of climate; and, yes, forcing us to confront systemic racism and white supremacy. It's just been weeks since all of America witnessed a group of thugs, insurrectionists, political extremists, and white supremacists violently attack the Capitol of our democracy. And so now , now is the time to act. It's time to act because that's what the faith and morality calls us to do. Across nearly every faith, the same principles hold: We're all God's children; we should treat each other as we would like to be treated ourselves. And this is time to act , and this time to act is because it's what the core values of this nation call us to do. And I believe the vast majority of Americans , Democrats, Republicans, and independents , share these values and want us to act as well. We have never fully lived up to the founding principles of this nation, to state the obvious, that all people are created equal and have a right to be treated equally throughout their lives. And it's time to act now, not only because it's the right thing to do, but because if we do, we'll all be better off for it. For too long, we've allowed a narrow, cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester. You know, we've , we've bought the view that America is a zero-sum game in many cases: \"If you succeed, I fail.\" \"If you get ahead, I fall behind.\" \"If you get the job, I lose mine.\" Maybe worst of all, \"If I hold you down, I lift myself up.\" We've lost sight of what President Kennedy told us when he said, \"A rising tide lifts all boats.\" And when we lift each other up, we're all lifted up. You know, and the corollary is true as well: When any one of us is held down, we're all held back. More and more economic studies in recent years have proven this, but I don't think you need economic studies to see the truth. Just imagine if instead of consigning millions of American children to under-resourced schools, we gave each and every three- and four-year-old child a chance to learn, to go to school , not daycare, school , and grow and thrive in school and throughout. When they've done that , the places it's been done, it shows they have an exponentially greater chance of going all the way through 12 years of school and doing it well. But, you know, does anyone , does anyone in this whole nation think we're not all better off if that were to happen? Just imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans the ability to own a home and build generational wealth , who made it possible for them buy a home, their first home , and begin to build equity to provide for their families and send their children off to school, does anyone doubt that the whole nation will be better off? Just imagine: Instead of denying millions of young entrepreneurs the ability to access capital, we made it possible to take their dream to market, create jobs, reinvest in their own communities. Does anyone doubt this whole nation wouldn't be better off? Just imagine if more incredibly creative and innovative , how much more creative and innovative we'd be if this nation held , held the historic black colleges and universities to the same opportunities , and minority-serving institutions , that had the same funding and resources of public universities to compete for jobs and industries of the future. You know, just ask the first HBCU graduate elected as Vice President if that's not true. But to do this, I believe this nation and this government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equal- , equity. Yes, we need criminal justice reform, but that isn't nearly enough. We need to open the promise of America to every American. And that means we need to make the issue of racial equity not just an issue for any one department of government; it has to be the business of the whole of government. That's why I issued, among the first days, my whole-of-government executive order that will, for the first time, advance equity for all throughout our federal policies and institutions. It focuses on the full range of communities who have been long underserved and overlooked: people of color; Americans with disabilities; LGBTQ Americans; religious minorities; rural, urban, suburban communities facing persistent poverty. And I've asked Ambassador Susan Rice to lead the administration's charge through the White House and Domestic Policy Council because I know she'll see it through. Every White House, every White House component, and every agency will be involved in this work because advancing equity has to be everyone's job. Today, I'll be shortly signing an additional package of executive actions to continue this vital work. Housing, for example: Housing is a right in America, and homeownership is an essential tool to wealth creation and to be passed down to generations. Today, I'm directing the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs , and Urban Development to redress historical racism in federal housing policies. Today, I'm directing the federal agency to reinvigorate the consultation process with Indian tribes. Respect the tribal sovereignty , respect for tribal sovereignty will be a cornerstone of our engaging with Native American communities. This builds on the work we did last week to expand tribes' access to the Strategic National Stockpile for the first time, to ensure they receive help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to fight this pandemic. Today, I'm directing federal agencies to combat resurgence of xenophobia, particularly against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, that we've seen skyrocket during this pandemic. This is unacceptable and it's un-American. I've asked the Department of Justice to strengthen its partnership with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community to prevent those hate crimes. I've also asked the Department of Health and Human Services to put out best practices for combatting xenophobia in our national response to COVID. Look, in the weeks ahead, I'll be reaffirming the federal government's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion and accessibility, building on the work we started in the Obama-Biden administration. That's why I rescinded the previous administration's harmful ban on diversity and sensitivity training, and abolished the offensive, counter-factual 1776 Commission. Unity and healing must begin with understanding and truth, not ignorance and lies. Today, I'm also issuing an executive order that will ultimately end the Justice Department's use of the private prison indus- , private prisons, an industry that houses pretrial detrainees [sic] , detainees and federal prisoners. The executive order directs the Attorney General to decline to renew contracts with privately operated criminal facilities , a step we started to take at the end of the Obama administration and was reversed under the previous administration. This is the first step to stop corporations from profiteering off of incarcerating , incarceration that is less humane and less safe, as the studies show. And it is just the beginning of my administration's plan to address systemic problems in our criminal justice system. Here's another thing that we need to do: We need to restore and expand the Voting Rights Act , named after our dear friend, John Lewis , and continue to fight back against laws that many states are engaged in to suppress the right to vote, while expanding access to the ballot box for all eligible voters. Because here's the deal, and I'll close with this: I ran for President because I believe we're in a battle for the soul of this nation. And the simple truth is, our soul will be troubled as long as systemic racism is allowed to persist. We can't eliminate it if , it's not going to be overnight. We can't eliminate everything. But it's corrosive, it's destructive, and it's costly. It costs every American, not just who have felt the sting of racial injustice. We aren't just less of a , we are not just a nation of morally deprived because of systemic racism; we're also less prosperous, we're less successful, we're less secure. So, we must change, and I know it's going to take time. But I know we can do it. And I firmly believe the nation is ready to change, but government has to change as well. We need to make equity and justice part of what we do every day , today, tomorrow, and every day. Now I'm going to sign these executive actions to continue the work to make real the promise of America for every American. Again, I'm not promising we can end it tomorrow, but I promise you: We're going to continue to make progress to eliminate systemic racism, and every branch of the White House and the federal government is going to be part of that effort. Thank you. This first executive order is a memorandum for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to redress our nation's and the federal government's history of discriminatory housing practices and policies.

I thank the Vice President for being with me today as well. In my campaign for President, I made it very clear that the moment had arrived as a nation where we face deep racial inequities in America and system- , systemic racism that has plagued our nation for far, far too long. I said it over the course of the past year that the blinders had been taken come off the nation of the American people. What ma- , what many Americans didn't see,or had simply refused to see, couldn't be ignored any longer. Those 8 minutes and 46 seconds that took George Floyd's life opened the eyes of millions of Americans and millions of people around , all over the world. It was the knee on the neck of justice, and it wouldn't be forgotten. It stirred the conscience of tens of millions of Americans, and, in my view, it marked a turning point in this country's attitude toward racial justice. When his six-years-old , six-year-old daughter, Gianna, who I met with when I met with the family , I leaned down to say hi to her, and she said , looked at me, and she said, 'Daddy changed the world.' That's what Gianna said , his daughter. 'Daddy changed the world.' And I believe she is right, not because this kind of injustice stopped , it clearly hasn't , but because the ground has shifted, because it's changed minds and mindsets, because it laid the groundwork for progress. COVID-19 has further ripped a path of destruction through every community in America, but no one has been spared, but the devastation in communities of color has been nothing short of stunning. Just look at the numbers: 40 percent of frontline workers , nurses, first responders, grocery store workers , are Americans of color, and many are still living on the edge. One in ten black Americans is out of work today. One in eleven Latino Americans is out of work today. One in seven households in America , about one in four black, one in five Latino households in America , report that they don't have enough food to eat in the United States of America. Black and Latino Americans are dying of COVID-19 at rates nearly three times that of white Americans. And it's not white Americans' fault, but it's just a fact. And the Americans now know it, especially younger Americans. One of the reasons I'm so optimistic about this nation is that today's generation of young Americans is the most progressive, thoughtful, inclusive generation that America has ever seen. And they are pulling us toward justice in so many ways, forcing us to confront the huge gap in economi- , excuse me, economic inequity between those at the top and everyone else, forcing us to confront the existential crisis of climate; and, yes, forcing us to confront systemic racism and white supremacy. It's just been weeks since all of America witnessed a group of thugs, insurrectionists, political extremists, and white supremacists violently attack the Capitol of our democracy. And so now , now is the time to act. It's time to act because that's what the faith and morality calls us to do. Across nearly every faith, the same principles hold: We're all God's children; we should treat each other as we would like to be treated ourselves. And this is time to act , and this time to act is because it's what the core values of this nation call us to do. And I believe the vast majority of Americans , Democrats, Republicans, and independents , share these values and want us to act as well. We have never fully lived up to the founding principles of this nation, to state the obvious, that all people are created equal and have a right to be treated equally throughout their lives. And it's time to act now, not only because it's the right thing to do, but because if we do, we'll all be better off for it. For too long, we've allowed a narrow, cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester. You know, we've , we've bought the view that America is a zero-sum game in many cases: 'If you succeed, I fail.' 'If you get ahead, I fall behind.' 'If you get the job, I lose mine.' Maybe worst of all, 'If I hold you down, I lift myself up.' We've lost sight of what President Kennedy told us when he said, 'A rising tide lifts all boats.' And when we lift each other up, we're all lifted up. You know, and the corollary is true as well: When any one of us is held down, we're all held back. More and more economic studies in recent years have proven this, but I don't think you need economic studies to see the truth. Just imagine if instead of consigning millions of American children to under-resourced schools, we gave each and every three- and four-year-old child a chance to learn, to go to school , not daycare, school , and grow and thrive in school and throughout. When they've done that , the places it's been done, it shows they have an exponentially greater chance of going all the way through 12 years of school and doing it well. But, you know, does anyone , does anyone in this whole nation think we're not all better off if that were to happen? Just imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans the ability to own a home and build generational wealth , who made it possible for them buy a home, their first home , and begin to build equity to provide for their families and send their children off to school, does anyone doubt that the whole nation will be better off? Just imagine: Instead of denying millions of young entrepreneurs the ability to access capital, we made it possible to take their dream to market, create jobs, reinvest in their own communities. Does anyone doubt this whole nation wouldn't be better off? Just imagine if more incredibly creative and innovative , how much more creative and innovative we'd be if this nation held , held the historic black colleges and universities to the same opportunities , and minority-serving institutions , that had the same funding and resources of public universities to compete for jobs and industries of the future. You know, just ask the first HBCU graduate elected as Vice President if that's not true. But to do this, I believe this nation and this government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equal- , equity. Yes, we need criminal justice reform, but that isn't nearly enough. We need to open the promise of America to every American. And that means we need to make the issue of racial equity not just an issue for any one department of government; it has to be the business of the whole of government. That's why I issued, among the first days, my whole-of-government executive order that will, for the first time, advance equity for all throughout our federal policies and institutions. It focuses on the full range of communities who have been long underserved and overlooked: people of color; Americans with disabilities; LGBTQ Americans; religious minorities; rural, urban, suburban communities facing persistent poverty. And I've asked Ambassador Susan Rice to lead the administration's charge through the White House and Domestic Policy Council because I know she'll see it through. Every White House, every White House component, and every agency will be involved in this work because advancing equity has to be everyone's job. Today, I'll be shortly signing an additional package of executive actions to continue this vital work. Housing, for example: Housing is a right in America, and homeownership is an essential tool to wealth creation and to be passed down to generations. Today, I'm directing the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs , and Urban Development to redress historical racism in federal housing policies. Today, I'm directing the federal agency to reinvigorate the consultation process with Indian tribes. Respect the tribal sovereignty , respect for tribal sovereignty will be a cornerstone of our engaging with Native American communities. This builds on the work we did last week to expand tribes' access to the Strategic National Stockpile for the first time, to ensure they receive help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to fight this pandemic. Today, I'm directing federal agencies to combat resurgence of xenophobia, particularly against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, that we've seen skyrocket during this pandemic. This is unacceptable and it's un-American. I've asked the Department of Justice to strengthen its partnership with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community to prevent those hate crimes.

Good afternoon. I'm accompanied by Jeff Zients, who is heading up our whole COVID team. And today, what I'd like to do is to upgrade , update you on where we are. Tomorrow, we're going to begin the briefings that are going to occur on a regular basis with Mr. Zients and his team. So we're bringing back the pros to talk about COVID in an unvarnished way. Any questions you have, that's how we'll handle them because we're letting science speak again. And so, I , I'd like to update you on the aggressive steps we're taking to meet our goal of administering 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots within , within a hundred days, and to ramp up the vaccine supply as fast as we can. This will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we've ever undertaken as a nation. I've said that before, but I must say it again because we're going to do , we're going to do everything we can to get it done. But a lot of things can go wrong along the way. And so, I've , as I've said in the past, we want to give credit to everyone involved in this vaccine effort and the prior administration and the science community and the medical sphere , (technical equipment falls to the floor) , for getting the program , I didn't do it, I promise , (laughter) , for getting the program off the ground. And that credit is absolutely due. But it's also no secret that we have recently discovered, in the final days of the transition , and it wasn't until the final days we got the kind of cooperation we needed , that once we arrived, the vaccine program is worse shape than we anticipated or expected. A lot of you who follow this , and nobody is , I mean this sincerely, the press is the smartest group of people in town; you hone this stuff down, clearly , I think you found the same thing. Even before I took office, I announced a new vaccine , a vaccination strategy which centers on federal leadership and execution for our whole country. And that's why I directed my COVID team to go to work immediately, and how we could step up the vaccination efforts and the vaccinations. I'm pleased to announce the first progress in that work today on day seven of my presidency. First, after review of the current vaccine supply manufacturing plants, I can announce that we will increase overall weekly vaccination distribution to states, tribes, and territories from 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses, starting next week. That's an increase of 1.4 million doses per week. And you all know , if I may note, parenthetically , you all know , know that the vaccines are distributed to states based on population. They're based on population. And so the smaller the state, the less vaccine; the bigger the state, the more they get. And so this is going to allow millions of more Americans to get vaccinated sooner than previously anticipated. We got a long way to go, though. The second thing: We're increasing the transparency with states, cities, and tribes, and local partners when it comes to the vaccine supply. This is something we've heard over and over again from both Democrats and Republicans, state and local leaders: that they need a plan in order to what , they didn't know what they had to plan on. They need to know what the order is going to be. Jeff had a meeting with the governors on Zoom and , and others. And I think we're getting this coordinated in a way that there's increased cooperation and confidence. But until now, we've had to guess how much vaccine to expect for the next week. And that's what the governors had to do: \"How much am I getting next week?\" This is unacceptable. They , you know, the lives are at stake here. From this week forward, God willing, we'll ensure that states, tribes, and territories will now always have a reliable three-week forecast on what the supply they're going to get. So they'll know, three weeks ahead of time, what's going to be there in the third week. This is going to help make sure governors, mayors, and local leaders have greater certainty around supply so they can carry out their plans to vaccinate as many people as possible. So, we will both increase the supply in the short term by more than 15 percent and give our states and local partners more certainty about when the deliveries will arrive. These two steps are going to help increase our prospects of hitting and , or exceeding, God willing, the ambitious goal of 100 million shots in 100 days. But I also want to be clear: 100 million shots in 100 days is not the endpoint; it's just the start. We're not stopping there. The end goal is to beat COVID-19. And the way we do that is to get more people vaccinated, which means we have to be ready, after we hit the ground [sic] , after we hit the goal of 100 million shots in 100 days. Now, that means fewer than 100 million people getting totally vaccinated; it means 100 [million] shots, and it means somewhere between 60 , maybe less, maybe more , million people will have the , because it requires two shots in many cases , not always. So today, I'm directing COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zeints, here, to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to increase our total supply of vaccine for the American people. And we believe that we'll soon be able to confirm the purchase of an additional 100 billion [million] doses for each of the two FDA-authorized vaccines: Pfizer and Moderna. That's 100 million more doses of Pfizer and 100 million more doses of Moderna , 200 million more doses than the federal government had previously secured. Not in hand yet, but ordered. We expect these additional 200 million doses to be delivered this summer. And some of it will come as early , begin to come in early summer, but by the mid- , by the mid-summer, that this vaccine will be there. And the order , and that increases the total vaccine order in the United States by 50 percent , from 400 million ordered to 600 million. This is enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 Americans by the end of the summer, beginning of the fall. But we want to make , look, that's , I want to repeat: It'll be enough to fully vaccinate 300 [million] Americans to beat this pandemic , 300 million Americans. And this is aggregate plan that doesn't leave anything on the table or anything to chance, as we've seen happen in the past year. I've said before: This is a wartime effort. When I say , when I say that, people ask, \"Wartime?\" I say, \"Yeah, more than 400,000 Americans have already died.\" I think it's four hundred eleven or twelve [thousand] have died in one year of this pandemic , more than all the people who died in all of , Americans who died in World War Two. This is a wartime undertaking; it's not hyperbole. And as such, I directed the team to be ready to exercise all the authorities I have under the Defense Production Act, and expedite these vaccines. And we're using the Defense Production Act to launch a full-scale, wartime effort to address the supply shortages we inherited from the previous administration. We're going to be working across the government, with private industry, to ramp up production of vaccine and protective equipment , the syringes, the needles, the gloves, the swabs, and the masks , everything that's needed to protect, test, vaccinate, and take care of our people. Well, we've already identified suppliers, and we're working with them to move our plan forward. The biggest problem , I hope you're all asking me by the end of the summer that, \"You have too much vaccine left over. You have too much equipment leftover.\" That's not my worry. I hope that becomes the problem, rather than we somehow find interruptions in supply or access. These aggressive steps to increase vaccine supply come on top of the steps we took last week to get more people vaccinated for free, to create more places for them to get vaccinated, and to mobilize more medical teams to get shots in people's arms. We've directed FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to stand up the first federally supported community vaccination centers, and that work is underway. We're working to make vaccines available to thousands of local pharmacies,beginning in early February; it's a couple weeks off. And we , that will enormously expand our reach. Last week, I also signed a declaration to immediately begin reimbursing states 100 percent for the uses of their National Guard to help the COVID relief effort, both getting people , getting the sites set up and even using some of their personnel to administer some of the vaccines. And I think it's something Democrats and Republicans and governors alike have called for. We're also expanding testing, which will help schools andbusinesses reopen safely and protect the most vulnerable. And we formalized the Health Equity Task Force to ensure that equity is at the core of everything we do in urban and rural communities alike, to make sure those people most significantly damaged have , have access. Access. We have to change. We have move in a direction for those communities that are hard to get to. But the brutal truth is: It's going to take months before we can get the majority of Americans vaccinated. Months. In the next few months, masks , not vaccines , are the best defense against COVID-19. Experts say that wearing masks from now just until April would save 50,000 lives who otherwise will pass away if we don't wear these masks. That's why I'm asking the American people to mask up for the first 100 days. I've issued executive orders requiring masks on federal property andinterstate travel , trains and planes and buses. One congressman pointed out , I could , well, he used a very, anyway, colorful term to say wearing a mask , \"I tell him to kiss my ear; I'm not going to wear a mask.\" Well, guess what? Not very American. The fact is, you want to be patriotic; you're going to protect people. And new COVID-19 variants are , we are instituting new measures to deal with these individuals flying into the United States from other countries. You've all hold , if you could hold a second , you've all heard about the strain , the British strain, the Brazilian strain, the South African strain. And they are , they seem to be more transmittable more easily. So, in addition to wearing masks, everyone flying to the United States from another country, we need to test before they get on that plane and self-quarantine when they arrive in America. I'm going to close with this: I now have a national , we now have a national strategy to beat COVID-19. It's comprehensive. It's based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial. And it is detailed. It's going to require Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan to provide funding to administer the vaccines, to ramp up testing, to help schools and businesses reopen, and to deliver immediateeconomic relief to Americans who are badly in need of it through no fault of their own. And our plan will take time. Progress from our plan will take time to measure, as people getting infected today don't show up in case counts for weeks, and those who perish from those , from the disease die weeks after that exposure. You know, despite the best , our best intentions, we're going to face setbacks, which I will always explain to you and acknowledge. And let me be clear: Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better. The death toll, experts tell us, is likely to top 500,000 by the end of next month , February , and cases will continue to mount. We didn't get into this mess overnight, and it's going to take months for us to turn things around. But let me be equally clear: We're going to get through this. We will defeat this pandemic. And to a nation waiting for action, let me be clearest on this point: Help is on the way. We can do this if we come together, if we listen to the scientists. And as I said: Tomorrow, I say to the press, the entire team will be back in the business of , my COVID team , of answering all your detailed questions. So, thank you very much for your patience. Keep the faith. We're going to get this done. And I'll always level with you about the state of affairs. Thank you.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1495830\/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-fight-to-contain-the-covid-19-pandemic&speechType=1","Summary":"Health and Health Care","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/speeches-remarks\/2021\/01\/26\/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-fight-to-contain-the-covid-19-pandemic\/","CleanText":"Thank you for taking the time to be here.

So today, I'm directing COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zeints, here, to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to increase our total supply of vaccine for the American people. And we believe that we'll soon be able to confirm the purchase of an additional 100 billion doses for each of the two FDA-authorized vaccines: Pfizer and Moderna. That's 100 million more doses of Pfizer and 100 million more doses of Moderna , 200 million more doses than the federal government had previously secured. Not in hand yet, but ordered. We expect these additional 200 million doses to be delivered this summer. And some of it will come as early , begin to come in early summer, but by the mid- , by the mid-summer, that this vaccine will be there. And the order , and that increases the total vaccine order in the United States by 50 percent , from 400 million ordered to 600 million. This is enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 Americans by the end of the summer, beginning of the fall. But we want to make , look, that's , I want to repeat: It'll be enough to fully vaccinate 300 Americans to beat this pandemic , 300 million Americans. And this is aggregate plan that doesn't leave anything on the table or anything to chance, as we've seen happen in the past year. I've said before: This is a wartime effort. When I say , when I say that, people ask, 'Wartime?' I say, 'Yeah, more than 400,000 Americans have already died.' I think it's four hundred eleven or twelve have died in one year of this pandemic , more than all the people who died in all of , Americans who died in World War Two. This is a wartime undertaking; it's not hyperbole. And as such, I directed the team to be ready to exercise all the authorities I have under the Defense Production Act, and expedite these vaccines. And we're using the Defense Production Act to launch a full-scale, wartime effort to address the supply shortages we inherited from the previous administration. We're going to be working across the government, with private industry, to ramp up production of vaccine and protective equipment , the syringes, the needles, the gloves, the swabs, and the masks , everything that's needed to protect, test, vaccinate, and take care of our people. Well, we've already identified suppliers, and we're working with them to move our plan forward. The biggest problem , I hope you're all asking me by the end of the summer that, 'You have too much vaccine left over. You have too much equipment leftover.' That's not my worry. I hope that becomes the problem, rather than we somehow find interruptions in supply or access. These aggressive steps to increase vaccine supply come on top of the steps we took last week to get more people vaccinated for free, to create more places for them to get vaccinated, and to mobilize more medical teams to get shots in people's arms. We've directed FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to stand up the first federally supported community vaccination centers, and that work is underway. We're working to make vaccines available to thousands of local pharmacies,beginning in early February; it's a couple weeks off. And we , that will enormously expand our reach. Last week, I also signed a declaration to immediately begin reimbursing states 100 percent for the uses of their National Guard to help the COVID relief effort, both getting people , getting the sites set up and even using some of their personnel to administer some of the vaccines. And I think it's something Democrats and Republicans and governors alike have called for. We're also expanding testing, which will help schools andbusinesses reopen safely and protect the most vulnerable. And we formalized the Health Equity Task Force to ensure that equity is at the core of everything we do in urban and rural communities alike, to make sure those people most significantly damaged have , have access. Access. We have to change. We have move in a direction for those communities that are hard to get to. But the brutal truth is: It's going to take months before we can get the majority of Americans vaccinated. Months. In the next few months, masks , not vaccines , are the best defense against COVID-19. Experts say that wearing masks from now just until April would save 50,000 lives who otherwise will pass away if we don't wear these masks. That's why I'm asking the American people to mask up for the first 100 days. I've issued executive orders requiring masks on federal property andinterstate travel , trains and planes and buses. One congressman pointed out , I could , well, he used a very, anyway, colorful term to say wearing a mask , 'I tell him to kiss my ear; I'm not going to wear a mask.' Well, guess what? Not very American. The fact is, you want to be patriotic; you're going to protect people. And new COVID-19 variants are , we are instituting new measures to deal with these individuals flying into the United States from other countries. You've all hold , if you could hold a second , you've all heard about the strain , the British strain, the Brazilian strain, the South African strain. And they are , they seem to be more transmittable more easily. So, in addition to wearing masks, everyone flying to the United States from another country, we need to test before they get on that plane and self-quarantine when they arrive in America. I'm going to close with this: I now have a national , we now have a national strategy to beat COVID-19. It's comprehensive. It's based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial. And it is detailed. It's going to require Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan to provide funding to administer the vaccines, to ramp up testing, to help schools and businesses reopen, and to deliver immediateeconomic relief to Americans who are badly in need of it through no fault of their own. And our plan will take time. Progress from our plan will take time to measure, as people getting infected today don't show up in case counts for weeks, and those who perish from those , from the disease die weeks after that exposure. You know, despite the best , our best intentions, we're going to face setbacks, which I will always explain to you and acknowledge. And let me be clear: Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better. The death toll, experts tell us, is likely to top 500,000 by the end of next month , February , and cases will continue to mount. We didn't get into this mess overnight, and it's going to take months for us to turn things around. But let me be equally clear: We're going to get through this. We will defeat this pandemic. And to a nation waiting for action, let me be clearest on this point: Help is on the way. We can do this if we come together, if we listen to the scientists. And as I said: Tomorrow, I say to the press, the entire team will be back in the business of , my COVID team , of answering all your detailed questions. So, thank you very much for your patience. Keep the faith. We're going to get this done. And I'll always level with you about the state of affairs. Thank you."}

I know the press has just had a long session with , with the team here about what I'm going to be talking about today and this afternoon. And let me just start by saying, I can't tell you how much I appreciate the three people standing next to me here for what they've agreed to do to help, particularly my best buddy, John Kerry. Asking a former Secretary of State to come back and do this has been a , I know it was a big ask on the part of myself. I was going to , I was going to blame Kamala for it as well, but for both of us. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Why not? (Laughs.) THE PRESIDENT: And , but John has been deeply involved; the Secretary has been deeply involved in climate issues as a senator and one of the leaders, legislatively, as well. And I don't think anybody knows more about the issue and the damage that's been done by some of the executive orders of the previous administration. And Gina , you run everything, Gina. Thank you very much. Let me get to it. Today is \"Climate Day\" at the White House and , which means that today is \"Jobs Day\" at the White House. We're talking about American innovation, American products, American labor. And we're talking about the health of our families and cleaner water, cleaner air, and cleaner communities. We're talking about national security and America leading the world in a clean energy future. It's a future of enormous hope and opportunity. It's about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we , that's now facing us , climate change , with a greater sense of urgency. In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis and we can't wait any longer. We see it with our own eyes, we feel it, we know it in our bones, and it's time to act. And I might note, parenthetically: If you notice, the attitude of the American people toward greater impetus on focusing on climate change and doing something about it has increased across the board , Democrat, Republican, independent. It's , that's why I'm signing today an executive order to supercharge our administration ambitious plan to confront the existential threat of climate change. And it is an existential threat. Last year, wildfires burned more than 5,000 acres in the West , as no one knows better than the Vice President, a former Senator from California , an area roughly the size of the entire state of New Jersey. More intense and powerful hurricanes and tropical storms pummeled states across the Gulf Coast and along the East Coast , I can testify to that, from Delaware. Historic floods, severe droughts have ravaged the Midwest. More Americans see and feel the devastation in big cities, small towns, coastlines, and in farmlands, in red states and blue states. And the Defense Department reported that climate change is a direct threat to more than two thirds of the military's operational critical installations. Two thirds. And so this could , we could , this could well be on the conservative side. And many climate and health calamities are colliding all at once. It's not just the pandemic that keeps people inside; it's poor air quality. Multiple studies have shown that air pollution is associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19. And just like we need a unified national response to COVID-19, we desperately need a unified national response to the climate crisis because there is a climate crisis. We must keep , we must lead global response because neither challenge can be met, as Secretary Kerry has pointed out many times, by the United States alone. We know what to do, we've just got to do it. When we think of climate change, we think of it , this is a case where conscious and convenience cross paths, where dealing with this existential threat to the planet and increasing our economic growth and prosperity are one in the same. When I think of climate change, I think of , and the answers to it , I think of jobs. A key plank of our Build Back Better Recovery Plan is building a modern, resilient climate infrastructure and clean energy future that will create millions of good-paying union jobs , not 7, 8, 10, 12 dollars an hour, but prevailing wage and benefits. You know, we can put millions of Americans to work modernizing our water systems, transportation, our energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme climate. We've already reached a point where we're going to have to live with what it is now. That's going to require a lot of work all by itself, without it getting any worse. When we think of renewable energy, we see American manufacturing, American workers racing to lead the global market. We see farmers making American agriculture first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions and gaining new sources of income in the process. And I want to parenthetically thank the Secretary of Agriculture for helping to put together that program during the campaign. We see small business and master electricians designing, installing, and innovating energy-conserving technologies and building homes and buildings. And we're going to reduce electric consumption and save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs in the process. And when the previous administration reversed the Obama-Biden vehicle standard and picked Big Oil companies over American workers, the Biden-Harris administration will not only bring those standards back, we'll set new, ambitious ones that our workers are ready to meet. We see these workers building new buildings, installing 500,000 new electric vehicle charging stations across the country as we modernize our highway systems to adapt to the changes that have already taken place. We see American consumers switching to electric vehicles through rebates and incentives, and the residents of our cities and towns breathing cleaner air, and fewer kids living with asthma and dying from it. And not only that, the federal government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles, as you all know. With today's executive order, combined with the Buy American executive order I signed on Monday, we're going to harness the purchasing power of the federal government to buy clean, zero-emission vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in America. With everything I just mentioned, this will mean one million new jobs in the American automobile industry. One million. And we'll do another thing: We'll take steps towards my goal of achieving 100 percent carbon-pollution-free electric sector by 2035. Transforming the American electric sector to produce power without carbon pollution will be a tremendous spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century, not to mention the benefits to our health and to our environment. Already, 84 percent of all new electric capacity planned to come onto the electric grid this is year is clean energy. Clean energy. Why? Because it's affordable; because it's clean; because, in many cases, it's cheaper. And it's the way we're keeping up , they're keeping up. We're going to need scientists, the national labs, land-grant universities, historical black colleges and universities to innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit clean electric , clean electricity across distances, and battery technology, and a whole range of other things. We need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them. We need iron workers and welders to install them. Technologies they invent, design, and build will ultimately become cheaper than any other kind of energy, helping us dramatically expand our economy and create more jobs with a cleaner, cleaner environment. And we'll become the world's largest exporter of those technologies, creating even more jobs. You know, we are also , we're going to build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that are going to benefit communities three times over: one, by alleviating the affordable housing crisis; two, by increasing energy efficiency; and, three, by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to home ownership. We're also going to create more than a quarter million jobs to do things like plug the millions of abandoned oil and gas wells that pose an ongoing threat to the health and safety of our communities. They're abandoned wells that are open now, and we're going to put people to work. They're not going to lose jobs in these areas; they're going to create jobs. They're going to get prevailing wage to cap those over a million wells. These aren't pie-in-the-sky dreams. These are concrete, actionable solutions, and we know how to do this. The Obama-Biden administration reduced the auto industry , rescued the auto industry and helped them retool. We need solar energy cost-competitive with traditional energy, weatherizing more , we made them cost-competitive, weatherizing more than a million homes. The Recovery Act of our administration , the last admin- , our admin- , the Democratic administration made record clean energy investments: $90 billion. The President asked me to make sure how that money was spent, on everything from smart grid systems to clean energy manufacturing. Now, the Biden-Harris administration is going to do it again and go beyond. The executive order I'll be signing establishes a White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy. And it'll be led by one of America's most distinguished climate leaders, former EPA Director Gina McCarthy. As the head of the new office and my National Climate Advisor, Gina will chair a National Climate Task Force, made up of many members of our Cabinet, to deliver a whole-of-government approach to the climate crisis. This is not , it's not time for small measures; we need to be bold. So, let me be clear: That includes helping revitalize the economies of coal, oil, and gas, and power plant communities. We have to start by creating new, good-paying jobs, capping those abandoned wells, reclaiming mines, turning old brownfield sites into new hubs of economic growth, creating new, good-paying jobs in those communities where those workers live because they helped build this country. We're never going to forget the men and women who dug the coal and built the nation. We're going to do right by them and make sure they have opportunities to keep building the nation and their own communities and getting paid well for it. While the whole-of-government approach is necessary, though, it's not sufficient. We're going to work with mayors and governors and tribal leaders and business leaders who are stepping up, and the young people organizing and leading the way. My message to those young people is: You have the full capacity and power of the federal government. Your government is going to work with you. Now, today's executive order also directs the Secretary of the Interior to stop issuing new oil and gas leases on public lands and offsh- , and offshore waters, wherever possible. We're going to review and reset the oil and gas leasing program. Like the previous administration, we'll start to properly manage , unlike it, we're going to start to properly manage lands and waterways in ways that allow us to protect, preserve them , the full value that they provide for us for future generations. Let me be clear, and I know this always comes up: We're not going to ban fracking. We'll protect jobs and grow jobs, including through stronger standards, like controls from methane leaks and union workers in , willing to install the changes. Unlike previous administrations, I don't think the federal government should give handouts to big oil to the tune of $40 billion in fossil fuel subsidies. And I'm going to be going to the Congress asking them to eliminate those subsidies. We're going to take money and invest it in clean energy jobs in America , millions of jobs in wind, solar, and carbon capture. In fact, today's actions are going to help us increase renewable energy production from offshore wind and meet our obligation to be good stewards of our public lands. It establishes a new, modern-day Civilian Climate Corps , that I called for when I was campaigning , to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. Look, this executive order I'm signing today also makes it official that climate change will be at the center of our national security and foreign policy. As Secretary Kerry , as our Special Presidential Envoy for Climate , with him, the world knows how serious I am about one of America's , by appointing one of America's most distinguished statesmen and one of my closest friends, speaking for America on one of the most pressing threats of our time. John was instrumental in negotiating the Paris Climate Agreement that we started to , that we rejoined , this administration rejoined on day one, as I promised. And today's executive order will help strengthen that commitment by working with other nations to support the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change and to increase our collective resilience. That includes a summit of world leaders that I'll convene to address this climate crisis on Earth Day, this year. In order to establish a new effort to integrate the security implications of climate change as part of our national security and risk assessment and analysis will also be included. With this executive order, environmental justice will be at the center of all we do addressing the disproportionate health and environmental and economic impacts on communities of color , so-called \"fenceline communities\" , especially those communities , brown, black, Native American, poor whites. It's hard , the hard-hit areas like Cancer Alley in Louisia- , Cancer Alley in Louisiana, or the Route 9 corridor in the state of Delaware. That's why we're going to work to make sure that they receive 40 percent of the benefits of key federal investments in clean energy, clean water, and wastewater infrastructure. Lifting up these communities makes us all stronger as a nation and increases the health of everybody. Finally, as with our fight against COVID-19, we will listen to the science and protect the integrity of our federal response to the climate crisis. Earlier this month, I nominated Dr. Eric Lander, a brilliant scientist who is here today, to be the Director of the Office of Science and Technology. I also nominated another brilliant scientist, Dr. Frances Arnold and Dr. Maria Zuber, to co-chair the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology , so-called \"PCAST\" , that President Eisenhower started six weeks after the launch of Sputnik. It's a team of America's top scientists charged with asking the most American of questions: \"What next? What's the next big breakthrough?\" And then helping us make the impossible possible. Today, I'm signing a presidential memorandum making it clear that we will protect our world-class scientists from political interference and ensure they can think, research, and speak freely and directly to me, the Vice President, and the American people. To summarize, this executive order , it's about jobs , good-paying union jobs. It's about workers building our economy back better than before. It's a whole-of-government approach to put climate change at the center of our domestic, national security, and foreign policy. It's advancing conservation; revitalizing communities and cities and in the fa, on the farmlands; and securing environmental justice. Our plans are ambitious, but we are America. We're bold. We are unwavering in the pursuit of jobs and innovation, science and discovery. We can do this, we must do this, and we will do this. I'm now going to sign the executive order to meet the climate crisis with American jobs and American ingenuity. And I want to thank you all. I'm going to go over and sign that now. The first order I'm signing is tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad. (The executive order is signed.) This next one: Restoring trust in government through science and integrity and evidence-based policy making. (The executive order is signed). One more here. And this last one is the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology established. (The executive order is signed). I thank you all for your time.

We're going to take money and invest it in clean energy jobs in America , millions of jobs in wind, solar, and carbon capture. In fact, today's actions are going to help us increase renewable energy production from offshore wind and meet our obligation to be good stewards of our public lands. It establishes a new, modern-day Civilian Climate Corps , that I called for when I was campaigning , to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. Look, this executive order I'm signing today also makes it official that climate change will be at the center of our national security and foreign policy. As Secretary Kerry , as our Special Presidential Envoy for Climate , with him, the world knows how serious I am about one of America's , by appointing one of America's most distinguished statesmen and one of my closest friends, speaking for America on one of the most pressing threats of our time. John was instrumental in negotiating the Paris Climate Agreement that we started to , that we rejoined , this administration rejoined on day one, as I promised. And today's executive order will help strengthen that commitment by working with other nations to support the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change and to increase our collective resilience. That includes a summit of world leaders that I'll convene to address this climate crisis on Earth Day, this year. In order to establish a new effort to integrate the security implications of climate change as part of our national security and risk assessment and analysis will also be included. With this executive order, environmental justice will be at the center of all we do addressing the disproportionate health and environmental and economic impacts on communities of color , so-called 'fenceline communities' , especially those communities , brown, black, Native American, poor whites. It's hard , the hard-hit areas like Cancer Alley in Louisia- , Cancer Alley in Louisiana, or the Route 9 corridor in the state of Delaware. That's why we're going to work to make sure that they receive 40 percent of the benefits of key federal investments in clean energy, clean water, and wastewater infrastructure. Lifting up these communities makes us all stronger as a nation and increases the health of everybody. Finally, as with our fight against COVID-19, we will listen to the science and protect the integrity of our federal response to the climate crisis. Earlier this month, I nominated Dr. Eric Lander, a brilliant scientist who is here today, to be the Director of the Office of Science and Technology. I also nominated another brilliant scientist, Dr. Frances Arnold and Dr. Maria Zuber, to co-chair the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology , so-called 'PCAST' , that President Eisenhower started six weeks after the launch of Sputnik. It's a team of America's top scientists charged with asking the most American of questions: 'What next? What's the next big breakthrough?' And then helping us make the impossible possible. Today, I'm signing a presidential memorandum making it clear that we will protect our world-class scientists from political interference and ensure they can think, research, and speak freely and directly to me, the Vice President, and the American people. To summarize, this executive order , it's about jobs , good-paying union jobs. It's about workers building our economy back better than before. It's a whole-of-government approach to put climate change at the center of our domestic, national security, and foreign policy. It's advancing conservation; revitalizing communities and cities and in the fa, on the farmlands; and securing environmental justice. Our plans are ambitious, but we are America. We're bold. We are unwavering in the pursuit of jobs and innovation, science and discovery. We can do this, we must do this, and we will do this. I'm now going to sign the executive order to meet the climate crisis with American jobs and American ingenuity. And I want to thank you all. I'm going to go over and sign that now. The first order I'm signing is tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad. This next one: Restoring trust in government through science and integrity and evidence-based policy making. (The executive order is signed). One more here. And this last one is the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology established. (The executive order is signed). I thank you all for your time."}

Biden, Jr. on International Holocaust Remembrance Day","Type":"statement","RawText":"Today, we join together with people from nations around the world to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day by remembering the 6 million Jews, as well as the Roma and Sinti, Slavs, disabled persons, LGBTQ+ individuals, and many others, who were murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Shoah. We must never forget the truth of what happened across Europe or brush aside the horrors inflicted on our fellow humans because of the doctrines of hatred and division. I first learned about the horrors of the Holocaust listening to my father at the dinner table. The passion he felt that we should have done more to prevent the Nazi campaign of systematic mass murder has stayed with me my entire life. It's why I took my children to visit Dachau in Germany, and why I hope to do the same for each of my grandchildren , so they too would see for themselves the millions of futures stolen away by unchecked hatred and understand in their bones what can happen when people turn their heads and fail to act. We must pass the history of the Holocaust on to our grandchildren and their grandchildren in order to keep real the promise of \"never again.\" That is how we prevent future genocides. Remembering the victims, heroes, and lessons of the Holocaust is particularly important today as Holocaust deniers and minimizers are growing louder in our public discourse. But the facts are not up for question, and each of us must remain vigilant and speak out against the resurgent tide of anti-Semitism, and other forms of bigotry and intolerance, here at home and around the world. The horrors we saw and heard in Charlottesville in 2017, with white nationalists and neo-Nazis spewing the same anti-Semitic bile we heard in the 1930s in Europe, are the reason I ran for president. Today, I recommit to the simple truth that preventing future genocides remains both our moral duty and a matter of national and global importance. The Holocaust was no accident of history. It occurred because too many governments cold-bloodedly adopted and implemented hate-fueled laws, policies, and practices to vilify and dehumanize entire groups of people, and too many individuals stood by silently. Silence is complicity. As my late friend and Holocaust survivor Tom Lantos so frequently reminded us: \"The veneer of civilization is paper thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest.\" When hatred goes unchecked, and when the checks and balances in government and society that protect fundamental freedoms are lost, violence and mass atrocities can result. The United States will continue to champion justice for Holocaust survivors and their heirs. We are committed to helping build a world in which the lessons of the Holocaust are taught and in which all human lives are valued.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1496588\/statement-by-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-on-international-holocaust-remembrance-day&speechType=6","Summary":"Civil Liberties and Civil Rights Arts, Entertainment, and History","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/statements-releases\/2021\/01\/27\/statement-by-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-on-international-holocaust-remembrance-day\/","CleanText":"Today, we join together with people from nations around the world to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day by remembering the 6 million Jews, as well as the Roma and Sinti, Slavs, disabled persons, LGBTQ+ individuals, and many others, who were murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Shoah.

While we were working with Congress on what became the Recovery Act that kept us from another Great Depression, we got another groundbreaking and critical piece of economic legislation passed and to the President's desk. I stood next to him and the incredible woman for whom the first law he would ever sign was named after, Lilly Ledbetter. Before she was a household name, she was like so many other women in the workforce , who worked hard, with honor, only to find out she was being paid less than a man for the same work. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act marked one small step to give women a fair chance to get ahead in this country. But we're still far from full fair pay in the workplace , as we've seen in this pandemic and economic crisis. Women are disproportionately working on the frontlines caring for our loved ones and working to beat the virus, but they continue to earn less than their male counterparts. The pandemic is widening women's income and wealth gaps, as more than two million have dropped out of the labor force, partly reflecting the increased domestic labor demands on women during the pandemic. Vice President Harris and I will lead an economic recovery that not only brings women back into the workforce, but that also breaks down barriers that have left women, especially women of color, unseen, underpaid, and undervalued. We applaud Senator Murray and Congresswoman DeLauro for reintroducing the Paycheck Fairness Act, which will take critical steps to end pay discrimination and increase transparency by protecting workers from retaliation for simply sharing their wages with their colleagues. It will also ban employers from seeking salary history, so they have one less false justification for under-paying women and people of color. And, it will provide tools to hold employers accountable for engaging in systemic discrimination. We urge Congress to pass it and to go further to end pay discrimination , starting by dramatically increasing funding for enforcement so that employers are held accountable. We also need to take additional steps to help women have more choices to rejoin or stay in the workforce and to have more options for high-paying jobs. That includes by providing paid family and medical leave, making child care more affordable and schedules more predictable and flexible, and building training pipelines into high-paying jobs. It also includes raising the minimum wage and boosting pay for those in the care economy , including child care workers, home health aides, and pre-school teachers. And, we must make it easier for workers to organize and bargain collectively, a critical path to reducing the wage gap for women. As we do this work, we urge employers across the country to partner with us and take immediate action to change the culture and pay practices that foster discrimination. We cannot move forward while leaving half of our country behind. I hope there is a bill that comes to my desk for me to sign, with Vice President Harris standing next to me as we ensure that women are valued, appreciated, and given the fair shot they deserve.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1496934\/statement-on-the-12th-anniversary-of-the-lilly-ledbetter-fair-pay-act&speechType=6","Summary":"Women Employment and Affirmative Action Economy and Fiscal","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/statements-releases\/2021\/01\/29\/statement-on-the-12th-anniversary-of-the-lilly-ledbetter-fair-pay-act\/","CleanText":"Twelve years ago to the day, President Obama and I were a little over a week into our time in office.
