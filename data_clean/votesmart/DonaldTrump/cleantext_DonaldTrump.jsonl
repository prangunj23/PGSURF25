{"SpeechID":"VSDT812019321","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2019-01-08","SpeechTitle":"Statement by the President","Type":"statement","RawText":"Today, I have signed into law S. 3191, the \"Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018\" (the \"Act\"). The Act provides for the review and, where possible, the release of records of criminal investigations relating to alleged Federal civil rights violations between 1940 and 1980 (\"cold case records\"). These records, however, include information in the possession of any branch of the Government and could encompass even recently created records that \"relate to\" alleged civil rights violations from that period. I fully support the goals of the Act; however, it raises several serious constitutional concerns. First, section 4 of the Act, which enumerates exceptions from the general requirement to release cold case records, could be read to compel disclosure of material covered by executive privilege. Section 4 does not explicitly protect records containing confidential executive branch deliberations, which fall within the deliberative process component of executive privilege. It does provide some protection for law enforcement and national security information, albeit on narrow grounds. In any event, my responsibility to protect these categories of information comes from the Constitution and cannot be limited by statute. Absent this protection, certain interests the Act seeks to safeguard, such as the integrity of the law enforcement process, could be harmed. Investigators and prosecutors must be free to conduct candid internal deliberations, and persons identified in investigatory files , such as victims, witnesses, and others , must be protected from unwarranted reprisals. Section 4 provides that records should not be disclosed if doing so would cause identifiable or describable harm to national security or law enforcement, invade personal privacy, risk substantial harm to cooperating witnesses or confidential informants, or interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings. These exceptions protect the confidentiality of certain deliberative material, sensitive law enforcement information, and other privileged information, but there may be circumstances that require the postponement of the disclosure of documents beyond what is expressly provided for under the Act. I cannot abdicate my constitutional responsibility to protect such information when necessary. Accordingly, I have signed the Act on the understanding that the public disclosure of records may be postponed where necessary to protect executive privilege. Similarly, section 3(f) of the Act could require disclosure, without regard to executive privilege, after 25 years of the date of enactment. This section provides that a record may be exempted from disclosure based on identifiable or describable damage to national security, military defense, law enforcement, intelligence operations, or the conduct of foreign relations. I will interpret this provision consistent with my authority under the Constitution to protect confidential executive branch materials. Section 3(f)(4)(A)(iii), however, suggests that the Archivist of the United States would need to concur in any decision of the President to continue to exempt such records beyond the 25-year mark. Because the Archivist is an official within the executive branch subject to plenary presidential supervision, and because executive privilege is a core Article II prerogative of the President, I do not understand this provision to empower the Archivist to countermand a decision of the President to exempt records. Related constitutional concerns arise with respect to the provision purporting to give the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board , the agency established by the Act and charged with reviewing the decision of a Government office to postpone disclosure of cold case records , the authority to compel agency heads to provide cold case records to the Board, as well as with the provision giving certain congressional committees \"access to any records held or created by the Review Board.\" My Administration will treat these provisions of the Act consistent with the President's authority under the Constitution to protect confidential executive branch materials and to supervise and guide executive branch officials. In addition, my Administration will follow the standard for automatic declassification and the categories of protected information set forth in section 3.3(b) of Executive Order 13526, of December 29, 2009, as well as in any subsequent revisions to that order. Second, section 5 of the Act raises serious concerns under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. That provision vests in the Review Board responsibility to assess the applicability of statutory grounds for withholding records and, in some cases, to make final decisions for the executive branch on whether to disclose potentially privileged information in covered records. The members of this Review Board will be principal officers, for whom the President has the sole power of nomination and the Senate has the sole power of advice and consent. Yet section 5(b) purports to set restrictive qualifications for the members and to direct the appointment of any replacement members, in the event of vacancies, within 60 days. These provisions conflict with the constitutional division of responsibility between the President and the Congress in appointing principal officers. I will make every effort to heed them but, consistent with my constitutional authorities, will treat the qualifications as advisory and will treat the timing requirement as permitting appointments after 60 days when additional time is necessary for me to find appropriate candidates to appoint to the Review Board. Third, section 5(f) of the Act purports to protect the members of the Review Board from removal by the President except on grounds of \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, physical disability, mental incapacity, or any other condition that substantially impairs the performance of the member's duties.\" The Review Board will be responsible for determining whether, when, and to whom to disclose potentially privileged information in cold case records. The Congress may not insulate decision makers who exercise core executive functions from plenary presidential supervision. I will, therefore, comply with these removal restrictions only insofar as they comport with my constitutional responsibility to supervise the executive branch, including the protection of information subject to executive privilege. Relatedly, section 5(i)(2) of the Act provides that a Federal court may enforce a subpoena issued by the Review Board pursuant to a \"lawful request of the Review Board.\" I have signed the Act on the understanding that the Board must request judicial enforcement of a subpoena through the Department of Justice, consistent with 28 U.S.C. 516 and the President's supervisory authority under Article II of the Constitution. Finally, the Administration considers civil rights cold case records to be a matter of public importance. I have, therefore, signed this Act without generally endorsing the establishment of independent agencies to review and facilitate the declassification and release of Government records. I also note that the Act does not contain any authorization of funds to be appropriated for its implementation, which will likely place a significant strain on agency resources. I encourage the Congress to appropriate such funds.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1314024\/statement-by-the-president&speechType=6","Summary":"Civil Liberties and Civil Rights","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/statement-by-the-president-24\/","CleanText":"Today, I have signed into law S. 3191, the 'Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018' (the 'Act').

{"SpeechID":"VSDT812019537","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2019-01-08","SpeechTitle":"President Donald J. Trump's Address to the Nation on the Crisis at the Border","Type":"speech","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans: Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country. America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War. In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now. This is a humanitarian crisis , a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States , a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end. My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security. These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe. In fact, safer than ever before. The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy. Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home. Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year , vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico. Senator Chuck Schumer , who you will be hearing from later tonight , has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected President. Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation. The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation. But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and re-opens the government. This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security. Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized. America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, who just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country. Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl. Over the last several years, I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration. I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?To every member of Congress: Pass a bill that ends this crisis.To every citizen: Call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve. When I took the Oath of Office, I swore to protect our country. And that is what I will always do, so help me God. Thank you and goodnight.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1313943\/president-donald-j-trumps-address-to-the-nation-on-the-crisis-at-the-border&speechType=1","Summary":"National Security Criminal Justice","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/president-donald-j-trumps-address-nation-crisis-border\/","CleanText":"My fellow Americans: Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.

We should just let it play, right? (Laughter.) We had a little luck with that song. And he's terrific , a good supporter. We appreciate it. We really appreciate this, too. I know you have a record crowd; that's nice. It's always nice to set records. And I want to thank Sonny. And he's setting records. We're setting records together for farmers and for agriculture. We've had so many good weeks and good days, and it's only going to get better because we're doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business, you're not even going to believe it. Your problem will be: \"What do we do? We need more acreage immediately. We got to plant.\" But I will say, we are doing some things with trade that are going to have a tremendous impact. You're going to be doing business with Canada, you're going to be doing business with places where it was very, very difficult to do business. It was very unfair. And a lot of great things are going to happen. So, I want to really thank everybody here, and I want to congratulate a very, very good and exciting football team that I watched yesterday, the New Orleans Saints. (Applause.) You know, it's , I can see there's a little group over here. I know who I'm talking to. The rest of the room is going like, \"Eh, I don't want to talk about that.\" (Laughter.) But you have to say, Drew Brees , he's one hell of a quarterback and it was a tremendous game. And so congratulations to the folks from this area and from this great state. (Applause.) It's a great state. I'm thrilled to be here in a state that I've had a lot of luck with , and I love a lot of people in this state; I know a lot of people , for, really, a truly historic occasion. This is the 100th annual convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation , 100 exactly. If it was 99 , although, I was here for 99, too, I have to be honest, right? I like the farmers. What can I do? I like farmers. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. For 100 years, this organization has faithfully represented the men and women who are the backbone of our country, truly. Let us all show our appreciation for a very dear friend and a leader , a great leader , Zippy Duval. Where's Zippy? Zippy. (Applause.) Where is, Zippy? What a job he does. He only called about 100 times to make sure I'm coming. (Laughter.) Thank you, Zippy. Great job. On this special anniversary, we gather to celebrate America's proud farming heritage. Through your sweat, through all of your work, the strength of your hands, and the faith in your hearts, the American farmer feeds, and fuels, and sustains our nation. So true. We are joined today by Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards. Thank you, Governor, for being here. Thank you. Thank you, John Bel. (Applause.) Thank you. Along with many members of Congress who are true champions of American agriculture. An incredibly talented man, a great doctor , he knows more about healthcare than anybody, and he's somebody that , he's really helped us out in so many different ways. And he's yours: Senator Bill Cassidy. Bill? Thank you very much, Bill. (Applause.) Appreciate it. A woman who had a tremendous victory , she came in for a short period of time. She was appointed, and it's always hard when you're appointed. If you look , I don't know about this, Cindy, but you take a look , they don't do too well. You did very well. You won in an incredible state: Mississippi. Cindy Hyde-Smith, thank you. That was a great win. (Applause.) A brilliant guy , he's very deceiving. My wife said, \"I love watching him on television.\" And I said, \"Who?\" \"John Kennedy.\" I said, \"John Kennedy? I don't know.\" But, you know, I thought maybe she was talking about the other John Kennedy. She was talking , this is a man who is totally brilliant. You know, I don't know if you know what this means: Oxford. Right? He went to Oxford. Oxford is a very , I'm very much into the world of schools. Oxford , you have to be very, very smart to go to Oxford. And he's very smart. He also loves this state. He loves the people. We gave a rally the night before he won that was incredible. And I looked , and I looked at that crowd. We had to have 40,000 people or more at a hangar , an airport hangar. I said, \"You know, John Kennedy? You're going to win.\" And he won and he won big. And he's my friend. John Kennedy. Thank you, John. (Applause.) Oxford. \"Oxford John.\" (Laughs.) Great. Congressman Ralph Abraham. Thank you, Congressman. Where are you? Congressman? (Applause.) Great job you do. He does a great job. Congressman Garrett Graves. And you know Garrett. Thank you, Garrett. Good job. Young, strong, smart. (Applause.) We got a lot of good politicians down here. And the legend from Louisiana , a man who's got a lot of courage. He was playing second base and it didn't work out so well for him that day, but I have never seen anybody with more strength and really more courage than Steve Scalise. Steve Scalise. (Applause.) He got hit hard. He got hit hard. He never even thought about quitting. He , I was there the night, in his hospital. And they didn't think he was going to make it. And I looked at him; he wasn't looking too good, I have to tell you. This is the first time I'm telling you this, Steve; you weren't looking too sharp. And his wife loves him, because she was a mess. She had tears pouring down. I'll tell you a couple of these little facts. Your family loves you, Steve. But all of a sudden, he started making a little progress, a little more. Worked so hard. And then, a few months ago, he was in a baseball game. And it was the Republicans against the Democrats. He's playing second base. And he didn't have great mobility, to be honest. In other words, moving like a foot to his right, a foot to the left , that was about it. And he gets the first pitch of the game. This is in a stadium, and a lot of people watching, and it's on television. And they put him at second base for one play. And the first hit is a smash , ground ball , hit at Steve. And I'm pretty good at this stuff; I look, I say, \"Oh, that's going right to second base.\" It went right in him , right at him. He bent down, stopped that ball, threw it to first. The place went crazy. And he then walked off the field in great triumph. (Laughter and applause.) Who could have done that but my Steve, right? (Applause.) That was incredible. That was incredible. He's a courageous guy. He's a great guy. He's also a really fine person. So, Steve Scalise , what you've been through, Steve, is incredible. And congratulations. Incredible job. As you all know, there is currently a tremendous humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. It's tremendous. It's been there for years. It's been there for decades. But because of what we're doing and because of how well our country is doing , And please sit down. Please. I'm just looking , and then the media , the fake news , they'll say, \"He got no standing ovations.\" You know why? Because everybody stayed standing. (Laughter.) Wait until you see that. It's true. Oh, they'll do it. They'll figure something out. (Applause.) That's true. (Applause.) That's true. (Laughs.) (Applause.) That's true. They can figure it out. They can take the best thing , I go home, I say, \"Darling, I did such a great job. Wait until you see the news tomorrow on something.\" (Laughter.) North Korea, China. We're doing great in the trade deal. China , this, that. They can make anything you do look bad. But I was watching as you're standing. And I said, \"You know, if they sit, it's probably better for me, because every once in a while, they'll stand.\" (Laughter.) The other way, they'll say, \"The crowd did not appreciate him. They didn't give him one standing ovation.\" (Laughter.) Anyway, thank you very much. Women and children are being ruthlessly exploited at our southern border by vicious coyotes , who would think of this? Human traffickers. Now, when you hear the words \"human traffickers,\" you think about 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago. You wouldn't think it's worse today in the world , this is a world problem , than it's ever been. And the reason it's worse is because of the Internet. They target young women. They target young children , the Internet. And they come in through our southern border into our country. And they'll have women taped , their mouths with duct tape, with electrical tape. They tape their face, their hair, their hands behind their back, their legs. They put them in the backseat of cars and vans, and they go , they don't come in through your port of entry because you'd see them. You couldn't do that. They come in through our border, where we don't have any barriers or walls. And they drive right in and they have no problems. And we'll get that stopped. We're going to have a wall. We're going to have a barrier. We're going to have something that's going to be very strong. (Applause.) One of the most important things. And I've built a lot of wall. You saw it the other day. They kept saying, \"You didn't build wall.\" I said, \"I built wall.\" So I actually decided I'd better put a picture for you to see. But we built a lot more than that. And we renovated a lot of pretty good stuff that we made good again. It was in very bad shape. But we've done a lot. We want to finish it because, you know, you can't have openings. Because if you have an opening, they go here and they just sort of go over this way. They find the open spot, they come in. And we have to build , what we have to build , probably a total of 550 miles including the renovations. And we've done a lot of work. People don't talk about it. I don't talk about it because, until we're finished, the big thing is we have to get it done. And we've had great support from John, your senator; Bill, your senator; from everybody. We've had tremendous , Steve is working hard in the House. Your congressmen are working really hard. Really hard. Because it's common sense. What we're talking about is common sense. Last month alone, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought across our borders. Twenty thousand. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the journey up from Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador. Think of that. Think of that. Hard to believe. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are being smuggled across the border. Most of the drugs coming into our country come in through the southern border , and much of it comes through areas that are not your portals , including meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl. Heroin alone, if you look at the heroin epidemic , it's an epidemic , heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week. And 90 percent of it , at least , crosses our southern border. It comes in through our southern border. And I've spent a lot of time with Secret Service and with Border Patrol and ICE , incredible people , and they show me the methods that they use , how they hide it. They put it in hubcaps. They put it in engines. They put it in areas you wouldn't believe. They're brilliant, in many ways. They're brilliant. You wouldn't even think of what they do to get things in. And we can stop it. But we can't stop it if we're going to play politics. And the numbers you're talking about are peanuts compared , you'll make the money back numerous times a year. In 2017, drugs killed over 70,000 of our fellow citizens , think of that, that's like a football stadium loaded up , and imposed costs on our society in excess of $700 billion dollars. In the last two years, ICE officers arrested 266,000 illegal aliens , think of that , with criminal records, including 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent murders or killings. The crisis of illegal immigration impacts all Americans , threatening public safety, overwhelming public resources, straining our local schools and hospitals, undermining U.S. workers, and claiming countless innocent lives. And I will tell you, I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. They have to come in through a process. (Applause.) Thank you. As President, the defense of our nation is my highest and most important duty. And this is the defense of our nation, just like we prepare for other nations that you think more traditionally is what that sentence refers to. When it comes to keeping the American people safe, I will never, ever back down. I didn't need this fight. This is a rough fight. We're dealing against people who think that if they can stop me from building the wall , again, we've already done a lot of work , but they think that's a good thing for 2020, because they're not going to win. They think if they can stop me from building the wall, that's good. This is the reason why they don't want the wall built , because they all know it works. They all approved it numerous times. I mean, Chuck Schumer had his hand up every time this would come up. The senators know this. They're only doing this because of the 2020 election because I said I'll build the wall and I'm going to build the wall. And it's only one of many things that I promised. I mean, if you look at , (applause) , I got you the biggest tax cut , beyond the Ronald Reagan tax cuts. ANWR, getting rid of the individual mandate, the biggest cuts in regulations in the history of our country , and we're going further. (Applause.) That might be the biggest reason that our country is doing so much better than other countries and why we're doing so well. But they view this as a political thing because this was one of the big things I , I said, \"We're going to do tax cuts. We're going to do regulation. We're going to do \" And, you know, we've done most of what we said. One of the , that's a lot of news back there. One of the folks back there said that \"He's actually done more than he promised.\" It's true. I have actually done more than I promised. We've done a lot. Even with the veterans. (Applause.) A lot of veterans in Louisiana. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Choice approved, which is pretty amazing. They've been trying to get that for years and years , decades and decades. And we got Accountability , VA Accountability. When you had somebody treating our veterans horribly, you couldn't do anything. You couldn't fire them , whether it's unions, or whether it's civil service, or whatever it may have been. But for decades and decades, somebody could do anything they wanted. They can steal, they could abuse our veterans, they can be sadists, they can do whatever they want and you couldn't fire them. And I got Accountability approved. Everyone said you couldn't get that , too much power against it. We got it done, and now we can say, \"Jim, you're fired. Get out of here. We don't want you taking care of our veterans.\" (Applause.) That was a big thing. A lot of help from those people. So we got a lot done, but they view the wall as being a big item that, if I don't do it, you know, it's a negative. It's a negative. And I'm not doing it for that reason. I'm doing it because we have to do it. It's common sense. We have to do it. If you look at the caravans coming up, if you look at what's going on , you take a look. If we didn't have some of those walls , the military has been incredible. They came up and they built some barriers , they kept thousands and thousands of people from overrunning various sections of our country. We've done a great job at the border, but we need that extra , we need that barrier because you can't do this. You can have all the people you want dressed in military. You can have ICE. You can have Border Patrol. If you don't have that barrier, there's not a thing you can do. You know, they all say, \"We like technology.\" I like technology, too. But we can have all the drones in the world flying around; we can have all the sensors in the world, but if you don't have a strong steel or concrete barrier, there's no way you're going to stop these people from rushing. Last week , and we have no idea who they are. And you got some , I'm sure , very good ones, but you got some real bad ones. Last week, I traveled to McAllen, Texas to tour the border and meet with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol. These great patriots made clear what they need from Congress and to end this terrible crisis. And we will end it. We will end it. You know, when we have proper security, people aren't going to come, except for the people we want to come because we want to take people in to help our farmers, et cetera. Very important. We're going to make that actually easier for them , to help the farmers. (Applause.) Because you need these people. No, you need these people. We're going to make it easier. (Applause.) I mean, I'm glad I told you that because, you know, look, you're in that business and a lot of people don't understand this. You need those , you need people to help you with the farms. And I'm not going to rule that out. I'm going to make that easier for them to come in and to work the farms. You've had some people for 20, 25 years. They're incredible. Then they go home and they can't get back in. That's not going to happen. But we're keeping the wrong ones out, okay? We don't want the wrong ones coming into our country. And, for that, it's going to be almost impossible to get in. For the people that work the farms, that have been here, that have gone through this very short but good process, that are going to help our country, it's going to be easier for them to get in that what they have to go through now. So just remember that. (Applause.) I know a lot about the farming world. And, if I don't, Sonny teaches me. They explained that there is no substitute for a wall , these are the ICE people and the Border Patrol people , or a physical barrier. There is no substitute. Where a barrier exists, illegal crossings plummet dramatically. In El Paso, they had , it was one of the most dangerous cities in the country. A wall was put up. It went from being one of the most dangerous cities in the country to one of the safest cities in the country overnight , overnight. Does that tell you something? (Applause.) And I can give you many examples of that. They say it's \"medieval\" , a wall. It is medieval. So is a wheel. I always say \"a wheel.\" But every time I look out, they all have wheels. You know, they may have gone electric and they may have done lots of different things, but every car I've seen still has wheels. (Laughter.) Wheels work and walls work. You know, there's some things you can't beat. (Applause.) That's why we've asked Congress to fund a steel barrier, or whatever you want to call it. This barrier will stop illegal activity, while directing lawful trade, travel, and commerce to our ports of entry. These ports are America's doors, but doors only work when you have strength. We need strength. Right now, we have weakness. They're forming a new caravan in Honduras. Honduras is not helping us. They could stop it. We send them hundreds of millions of dollars a year , El Salvador, Honduras, and other places , Guatemala , hundreds of millions, but they don't help us, like so many nations. We help them; they don't help us. We don't even get their votes often when we need their vote in the United Nations. They don't vote for us. Why? Because the wrong people are asking them. So those days are over. So I said just before I came , we're looking at a whole plan , why are we sending them money if they're allowing caravans to form right in the middle of their cities? Why are we sending them money? (Applause.) A lot of changes have been made in this country in less than two years, I will tell you that. A lot of changes. And really good changes , changes that people like you, with common sense and smarts, fully understand. And that's why we're liking where we are and the country is changing very rapidly for the better. As part of our overall border security plan, we have also asked Congress to approve cutting-edge technology to detect drugs. There's incredible technology today. So when these cars do come in through the ports of entry, you have technology today that's so incredible. We don't use it. We don't have it because our leaders decided not to spend the money. Well, you make it back every month , probably more than that , because the drugs coming through the southern border are destroying the fabric of our country. It's so bad. It's so bad. (Applause.) So we have to stop it. This technology is incredible. To fund more agents , we're putting that high on the list , officers, beds. Believe it or not, we're one of the only countries , I say \"one,\" because every time I say something else they'll say, \"Oh, well, there was a country that also did it.\" Somebody comes into our country, they touch one foot on the ground, and we have to catch them. It's called, \"catch.\" We then take their names and we bring them to a court , can you believe this? , and we release them. But, see, we're trying to do \"catch-and-hold.\" \"Catch-and-not-release.\" But you have to release. So we release. And they go into our country, and then you announce , these are the laws , then you say, \"Come back in three years for your trial.\" Tell me, what percentage of people come back? Would you say 100 percent? No, you're a little off. Like, how about 2 percent? (Laughter.) And those people, you almost don't want, because they cannot be very smart. (Laughter.) Two percent. Two percent. Two percent come back. Those two percent are not going to make America great again, that I can tell you. (Laughter and applause.) Crazy. So we have that and we have chain migration, where somebody comes in, and then his mother comes in, his father comes in, his grandmother comes in, his uncle comes in, his cousins come in. We had a guy , a radical Islamic terrorist in New York , area I know very well , driving down the West Side highway. Beautiful , Hudson River to his right. We built this gorgeous park all along the river. It's gorgeous. People are running; they're in great shape. We ought to all , some of these guys in the front row, they should do it with me. We could run. (Laughter.) Some of my friends over there. Sonny , maybe Sonny and I will go take a jog. (Laughter.) But you know what? I'll tell you, these are people that are great people, and they're running and they keep , and this horrible person, going down 60 miles an hour down a highway, decides, \"Oh, that's nice. We'll make a right turn.\" Hits a whole group of people purposely, screaming all sorts of things that they scream. And 8 people died; 12 or 13 were injured. Nobody talks about the injured. You know, some of the injured lost legs, lost arms. You know, this is , they say, \"Oh, well, 12 were injured.\" You know, like, injured , you think, like, a headache. No, no. They lost arms. They lost legs. One lost two legs. So 12 were horribly injured. And he's allowed to have his family come here. So they checked, and they said that he had about 22 people came in , chain migration. In other words, because he's here , so a whole group of people come in. And we don't want that. We have another one , the lottery. The lottery. We take people from countries through the lottery. Now, this is common sense. Do you think the country is giving us their finest? No, they're not. No, they're not. They're giving us the opposite of their finest. And we have a lottery system. \"Oh, let's pick him out. Oh, wonderful.\" Doesn't work out too well, this lottery system. But this is the law. This was passed by Democrats and, I guess, Republicans. You know, maybe they voted , who knows? But these are laws that have to be changed. These are , these are sick, demented laws that we have to change. We can't allow this to keep happening. The people that are sent to our country are not the people that we want. They come in through the lottery. They come in through chain migration. Think of it: This man that killed 8 people and so badly injured 12, they say he's about 22 relatives coming in that are here. And take a look at how well his relatives are doing. It's not a good picture. So we have to change our laws. It's very hard because the Democrats don't want to change them. But I hope that common sense and people like this can persuade them, because it's gotten to a point where you have to. We really have no choice. And we're fighting hard. We're fighting very hard for you. We're making a lot of progress, I can tell you that. (Applause.) Here with us today is Jim Chilton from Arizona. Jim's ranch runs along the U.S-Mexico border. The deadly , very deadly , Sinaloa cartel, one of the most vicious drug cartels anywhere in the world, runs a major drug trafficking route right through Jim's ranch. Many of these routes used to run through San Diego until the wall was built by us, by me. (Applause.) Sorry about that, Jim. (Laughs.) I think Jim has just got angry at me; he just heard that. Sorry, Jim. Because now, what they did, they went to Jim's ranch. I think I cost him a lot of money. Maybe he won't stand up after all. But it's a very sad situation. In the last two years, the cameras on Jim's ranch have captured roughly 1,000 pictures of major drug packers, they call them. For years, these criminals have damaged Jim's property, injured his livestock, and started dozens of fire, which Jim estimates cost more than $2 million dollars in 2017 alone. Last June, a Border Patrol agent was checking sensors on the Clinton's , and Chilton's ranch when he was shot multiple times by these sinister drug traffickers. Multiple times. And they don't even think about. By the way, they shoot , it's not like, \"Oh, gee, I committed a terrible thing.\" They don't even think about it. They don't even think. They wake up the next morning and they couldn't care less. As Jim has said, \"Every time I leave the ranch, my wife doesn't know whether I'll ever return.\" I would like to ask Jim to come up and say a few words. Jim, please come up. Thank you. (Applause.) MR. CHILTON: Mr. President, we need a wall. (Applause.) I would say we need a wall all around all the length of the border. We've got to stop the drug packers bringing drugs in to poison our people. And I would say to Speaker Pelosi, walls are not immoral. (Applause.) In fact, I've traveled around the world, and the biggest wall I've ever seen is around the Vatican. Now, you can't tell me that the wonderful priest and officials of the Roman Catholic Church, including the Pope, are immoral. They have a wall. Why can't we? (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Jim. (Applause.) Thank you, Jim. And I'm sorry for your problems, but we'll get it straightened out. The government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: The Democrats will not fund border security, our safety, our national security. People come from many countries. When I was at the wall the other day, Border Patrol said they have 150 people they caught that day who weren't from Mexico. I said, \"That's a strange statement.\" They said, \"No, these are the people that weren't from Mexico.\" And I was surprised. Three were from Pakistan. Four were from another Mid-East , two Mid-East countries. And many of them were from other countries, including China , countries all over the world. A hundred and fifty of the people, as he said, were not from Mexico. Now, they caught many, many more, but that's a 150 people coming from companies that , you know, really, countries that you wouldn't believe. They will not approve the measures we need to keep America safe , the Democrats. We can't do that. We can't do that because this is of paramount importance to our country. And again, I could take it nice and easy. I could enjoy myself. I could relax. I've been in the White House because I think it's very important to be there. And other people went on a nice, wonderful vacation over the weekend. They had a great time. I would have loved to have been with them. I didn't like the look of it. I would have loved to have been with them. But we have a very big problem. This should have been done by other Presidents. Just like the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem should have been done , it was promised by many other Presidents. (Applause.) Just like we're doing the job on North Korea, just like we're doing the job with China , we're getting it done. We're getting it done. We're getting it all done. But it would have been nice if other administrations were able to do it. But we have to do the border. In the meantime, the USDA is doing everything in its power to help farmers deal with the ongoing shutdown. We thank you for your support and patriotism. And we fight to defend our nation. We are fighting very hard to defend our nation. And many people that aren't getting a payment, that aren't being paid, have let us know in the strongest of terms , a big amount , they said, \"Sir, what you're doing is of paramount importance. Do the job right, and we are with you, 100 percent.\" You'd be surprised at how many people have said that. And it's not easy for them, but it's a lot of people. (Applause.) So I'm asking all of our citizens to call your Democrat lawmakers and ask them to pass a bill that secures our border, protects our country, and now reopens our government. Because as soon as they do that, we reopen our government. You would think that would be a very simple task. On every front, we are fighting for our great farmers, our ranchers, our growers. We are fixing broken trade deals that are horrible. I saw what was going on in Canada , the way you were treated. Horrible. And they treated their farmers great. Great. We changed it with the new trade deal we made with Mexico and Canada. And opening up new markets to export , many, many new markets are being opened up. We've eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. And the farmers got hit probably as hard as anybody. We're reversing harmful federal intrusion. And to keep family farms in the family, we have virtually eliminated the estate tax, also known as the \"death tax.\" (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Small business owners and corporations and others , small business , it was a terrible thing that was happening, where your parents , you love your parents , they're farmers , they love their farms. Everybody loves their farm. The kids , they want to grow up on the farm. They want to someday run the farm, own the farm. And they couldn't because they had very large estate taxes to pay. So they go out and borrow money, and then it turned a little bit bad. And all of the sudden, they'd end up losing the farm because they had to pay the estate tax. We got rid of it, folks. So if you love your children, you'll like me. If you don't love your children, and you weren't going to leave the farm to them, it probably doesn't matter too much, okay? (Laughter.) Does anybody here not love their children? Wow, that's a lot of people , not one? Okay, you don't want to say. That's all right. (Laughter.) That's like a lot of the people that went to the polls; they voted for Trump. (Laughter.) They said, \"We don't want to talk about it.\" Then we won. We won two years ago. In November, we won. (Applause.) And everybody is trying , they're still trying to figure out what happened. We don't have to talk about it. We know what we're doing. We're ensuring that ethanol remains a vital part of America's energy future, with E-15. And we're making it available year round , all 12 months. That was a big, big difference for the farmers. (Applause.) Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst , your senators , a lot of great people were very strong on that. And it also creates additional, because, if you noticed, I think we saw $1.75 for gasoline today, coming in. I like to do that; I'm one of these guys. (Applause.) I'm riding in this incredible car, and I'm driving, and I'm looking at gas stations to see how much is the gas. How many other Presidents , you think Hillary Clinton would have done that? I don't think so. I don't think so. (Laughter and applause.) I'm in the Beast , the world's most expensive car. It's like being in an army tank that goes 50 miles an hour, right? I'm in the Beast and I'm looking at gas stations. I say, \"Fellas, slow up. I can't see.\" (Laughter.) They say, \"$1.75.\" That didn't happen by accident, folks. That didn't happen by accident. People think it does; it doesn't. Nothing happens , very few, very little happens by accident. Nobody else would have done what we did for the farmers, with the estate taxes and so many other things. In the two years before my election, agricultural exports dropped by nearly $23 billion. Remember that: Before I got here, it was heading south. A lot of people say, \"Oh, gee, how are we doing?\" It was going bad. If you go back 15 years, soybeans were more expensive 15 years ago than when I got into office. They were less. Now they're up nearly $14 billion. In December, just a few days before Christmas, I was proud to sign the Farm Bill. We got it done. That wasn't easy either. (Applause.) That was not easy. Senators, Congressmen, thank you. That group did it. (Applause.) That was not an easy one, John and Bill, was it, huh? That wasn't easy. But we got it done. The first to be passed, on time, in over 30 years. Got it done. And I've authorized Secretary Perdue to be strong on work rules for the Food Stamp program, through regulations allowed by the bill. So I know you have a great Secretary. He'll do what's right. The Farm Bill delivers for our farmers on a wide range of key priorities. On critical farm programs, such as crop insurance, you will have the support you need to plan for the future. It increases the amount farmers can borrow so you can expand and improve your businesses. It also secures the $600 million commitment we made to build a modern, effective, rural broadband across America's heartland. You're not well serviced. (Applause.) That's something the great, great middle part of our country has been complaining about for a long time. You're not properly serviced. You will be now. You will be now. That bill is a great bill for the farmer. Last year, when I spoke to you, we had just passed our historic tax cuts. Here with us today is Kalena Bruce from Stockton, Missouri. Kalena is a rancher, and also an accountant for local farmers. Under our new tax plan, which lowers rates for small businesses and doubles the tax child credit , so important, that child tax credit. You know who fought for that? A young woman named Ivanka Trump. That's all she wanted. \"Dad? Dad? We have to get that passed, Dad.\" (Applause.) I said, \"Okay, Ivanka. Okay. Okay.\" (Laughter.) It turned out to be so popular. Kalena has seen that many families will save upwards of $4,000 in taxes this year alone. Kalena, I want to thank you and all of those incredible people that you represent. And just keep up the great work. Where is Kalena? Where is Kalena? She's around here someplace. Hi, Kalena. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. (Applause.) We're also leading the most sweeping regulatory reform at any time in our history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture rolled back almost $400 million in regulatory costs last year alone. And this year, they're projected to more than double those savings. We're saving farmers and ranchers from one of the most ridiculous regulations ever imposed on anybody in our nation: the Waters of the United States rule. (Applause.) Disaster , other than the title. Such a beautiful title. It was a total kill on farmers, on builders, on everybody. It was a total kill. Sounds so nice. In fact, I looked at John Kennedy, when I signed that. I said, \"John, I'm going to get killed for this one.\" Because what we did was take something , the \"Water of the United States.\" How beautiful is that? And yet, everything inside was a total kill on you , and other businesses, by the way. (Applause.) And we didn't get killed, did we, John, huh? We didn't. They love it. So many people have come , and, you know, the time when I signed that bill, I had ranchers, farmers, and some homebuilders behind me. And these are tough people. They were strong, tough men and women. And half of them were crying because we basically , our government stole their property. They couldn't do anything. They couldn't build. They couldn't do anything. They were crying. I said, \"What are you crying about?\" The one guy , I don't think he cried in his whole life. I don't think he cried when we was a baby. He was crying. (Laughter.) He said, \"Sir, you gave me back my life. You gave me back my property. They took it away , environmentally, took it away. And you're going to do the right thing.\" In the audience today is Val Wagner from Monango, North Dakota. Val , (applause). (Laughs.) It's a good place. (Laughter.) You have a great new senator, by the way. (Applause.) A great new senator. Really great. Val and her husband would love to expand their farm for their four boys, but under the Waters of the United States rule, they would have to pay tens and of thousands of dollars in fines because of the \"prairie potholes\" on their land. Do you all know what \"prairie potholes\" are? Yes, you do. I don't, but it sounds bad. (Laughter.) To Val and to every farmer, we are going to keep federal regulators out of your , out of your tanks , your stock tanks, your drainage ditches, your puddles, and your ponds. And you know exactly what I'm talking about. You could have a pond , a little pond , and they consider it a lake. (Applause.) And you're regulated as though it were a lake. We're going to get government off your backs so you can earn a living and support your families doing what you love. And I know what you love. Farmers love what they're doing. (Applause.) We also passed legislation to rebuild our water infrastructure, including our nation's inland waterways, which carry more than 60 percent of our agricultural products. We are replacing one-sided, unfair trade deals. We have so many nations , it's a one-sided deal. With China, every year, for many years, we're losing $375 billion , not million, billion dollars. We're working on that very strongly. You see what's going on. We're doing very well. We have the European Union , they don't treat us right. They treat our farmers terribly. You can hardly sell into the , they have barriers and they have tariffs that are massive. But with the farmers, they don't want your product. We're working with them; they have to treat us fairly. We're losing $151 billion a year with the European Union. It sounds so nice, right? \"The European Union.\" And then the press gets angry. They say, \"Donald Trump is not treating the European Union fairly.\" Well, that's because they're not treating us fairly, folks. I want to be nice. In fact, they said my poll numbers are very bad in Europe. I said, \"They should be.\" (Laughter.) No, seriously. They said, \"When he started off, he had 87 percent.\" That means you could be the king of any country. Now, they (inaudible) because I'm representing our country; I'm not representing those country , you know, one of those (inaudible). (Applause.) True. It's true. They said, \"His poll numbers have tanked.\" And I said, \"Oh, damn it. What's going on? Damn it.\" And then I said, \"Oh, it's in Europe. That's okay.\" (Laughter.) No, we get along well with them. And they're a lot of great people and great leaders. But, look, I'm not blaming them. I don't blame China. I mean, China , $375 billion a year, we lose. It's really more than that, but that's like the conservative number. I think it's $504 [billion]. But I'm giving you conservative because I don't want to be criticized for using wrong numbers, right? (Laughter.) But I don't blame China. I was in China making a speech, and President Xi , who's a friend of , great guy. But he represent them; I represent us. And he's sitting over here. And I'm talking to this massive crowd of people. And I'm talking about how China is bad, bad, bad. And I'm saying, \"Boy, this is , this could be dangerous.\" (Laughter.) I'm in China. I'm in Beijing doing this. And I'm saying, \"I don't like this.\" But I looked at him, and I realized , actually during that speech , it's not his fault or their fault. It's our fault for allowing that to happen. It's our leaders' fault. (Applause.) Over the last 15 years, we've seen a continual decline in the U.S. share of agricultural trade all throughout the world. You know that. It was all going in the wrong direction. It's changing now. Wait until you see what happens. If we do the right deal with China, you're talking about massive , they're already backordering, right? They're already back. I told them. I said, \"You got to start ordering. You're going to order.\" They're going to order, and they've already started. We're turning all of that around with fair trade deals that put American farmers, ranchers, and, in fact, put America first. That's what I'm interested in: America first. (Applause.) We just opened Argentina to American pork exports , pork , for the first time in a quarter of a century. They needed something; I said, \"You have to open it up to pork.\" And they said, \"Okay.\" I said, \"Why didn't you do it before?\" They said, \"Nobody ever asked us.\" (Laughter.) A lot of it is that. You would be amazed. Nobody ever asks. India and Morocco have both opened their markets to our poultry exports. We do so much for them. It's incredible. Japan opened its market to U.S. exports of potatoes from Idaho , (applause) , and lamb from the great state of Texas, yes. No, they just opened up. We asked them. We said, \"You got to open up. Sorry.\" U.S. beef has been shipped to Brazil for the first time since 2003. They're going to have a great new leader. They say he's the Donald Trump of South America. Do you believe that? (Applause.) And he's happy with that. If he wasn't, I wouldn't like the country so much. But I like him. And we opened China to American beef for the first time in many, many years. We've taken , (applause). You know that. But that was before the trade deal. Don't even worry about it. This is , that's peanuts compared to what we're talking about. We've taken the toughest-ever actions to confront China's unfair trade practices that hurt American farmers and ranchers. This includes China's theft of trade secrets from American agri-business. I couldn't believe how complicated your business is , with the seeds and the genetic farming. It's incredible. People don't know this. But your secrets were being stolen by China, and, in all fairness, other countries. We want a fair deal for American farmers , removing China's arbitrary bans on agricultural imports, safeguarding our intellectual property, and providing fair market access to all American producers. We have also made history by finalizing an agreement to replace the horrible NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, called the \"USMCA.\" A whole different world. A whole different world. (Applause.) NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made by a country. It killed our country. This landmark trade deal will increase exports of wheat from Montana, dairy from Wisconsin, chicken from Georgia, and products from farmers and ranchers all across our country.As part of the USMCA, Canada agreed to give fair treatment to American wheat farmers. They will now grade American wheat just like they grade their own wheat. (Applause.) Which, to me, doesn't mean much, but, to farmers, it means a lot. That's what they tell me. I said, \"What can we do?\" They said that would be a big thing , on wheat. Even the NFL , you know, the NFL, for many years, was having a hard time with Canada, having to do with the Super Bowl. I heard about it, and I asked about it. And it was a lot of money, but it was tiny compared to the overall deal with Canada and with Mexico. So, as one of the things, I said, \"You got to treat the NFL fairly.\" You know, it's a great American company. And we had the dispute over the National Anthem, and that seems to have worked out properly, which is great, which I give them credit for now. And I said, \"Listen, when you go to Canada, you're going to ask for this thing because they're not treating our company right.\" Any company , I don't care, but that was the NFL. A big company. A great American company. I said, \"You're not treating them well.\" We asked for it; in one minute, we solved a problem that they've been working on for many years. Total success. And they called up, and they thanked me. But it's something that I want to do for American companies. It's easy, it's short, it took a few minutes, and we got it. They were fighting for years. Canada also agreed to end unfair trade practices that hurt American dairy exports. Also here today are Cris and Gary Peterson, and their son Ben and daughter-in-law Nicki. More than 140 years ago, Gary's great-grandmother began their farm in a tremendous state , I love this state. Remember when they say, \"Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin\"? That state hasn't been won by a Republican in so long. Bill, you don't remember any wins there, right? That was a long time ago. That was even before your time. Right, Bill? A long time. And they said, \"Donald Trump \" Remember that? Was that a great evening or what? \"Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin.\" (Applause.) We love Wisconsin. Today, the Petersons have more than 900 dairy cows. Like so many of our great farmers, the Petersons have faced a number of threats to their farm and to their entire way of life. For years, NAFTA made it difficult for dairy farmers like the Petersons to export milk, ice cream, cheese, and many other dairy products. Under the USMCA, the Peterson family will finally have the level playing field that they should have had for many years. They have it now. Together, we urge Congress to support American agriculture, stand up for American workers, and hopefully they will approve the USMCA quite quickly. You know, the one thing I worry about , it's almost , no matter how good something is, they might not want to approve it, but they'll approve it. This one , I think it's going to be very tough for them not. But I think that , I hear it's in very good shape. And it replaces something that has been so bad to our country. This is a great deal. As we reverse the damage of decades of unfair trade, we are also providing up to $12 billion in relief to protect our farmers from unfair foreign retaliation. And you saw that recently with Sonny Perdue, where we were helping out during a very unfair period of time when people were actually trying to affect our election. Nobody brings that up. In this case, it was China. I haven't heard too much about that. Have you heard anything about that? But they were. And we helped our farmers out. No one understands better than our great farmers that the tough choices we make today reap rewards for centuries to come.More than 200 years ago, this very city was at the center of America's negotiations during the legendary Louisiana Purchase.No one knew how it would all turn out, but President Thomas Jefferson acted decisively for the American people. After months of negotiations, we got what no one ever imagined possible. Not only did we gain New Orleans, we doubled the size of the United States; we secured new parts and ports , new parts of the map and globe that we never thought, and new ports, very importantly for American agriculture; and we made our nation the greatest farm country on God's Earth. And it remains that. And it's now, for the first time in a long time, getting better. (Applause.) Our nation was founded, settled, and built by farmers. (Applause.) From the fields of Pennsylvania to the hills of Tennessee , (applause); from the plains of Missouri , (applause) , to the Big Sky of Montana , (applause); and from the marshes of Florida , (applause) , to the fertile valley of California , (applause) , farmers have always led the way. (Applause.) The American farmer embodies the timeless values of America. You believe in hard work and self-reliance. You follow the rules, obey our laws, and respect our great American flag. (Applause.) You support our communities, raise loving families, teach your children right from wrong, and you are always loyal to this magnificent nation that we so love. Now you have a government that is loyal to you, finally, in return. (Applause.) Because we know that government's first duty is to our own citizens. We are fighting for the American farmer, and we are fighting for the American Dream, and for products made and grown with pride right here in the USA. It's what we're fighting for. (Applause.) We are defending a cherished legacy, and we are preserving a beautiful way of life passed down from mothers and fathers to sons and daughters, from generation to generation. You are the keepers of this noble tradition. You are the guardians of this majestic heritage. We are standing up for the men and women who work the fields, till the soil, and harvest the land. We are protecting your rights, your freedoms, and our glorious Constitution.And we are doing it all with love in our hearts, joy in our souls, and trust in our God. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. To all of the farmers here today and across our country, the greatest harvest is yet to come. The future for America's farmers is bigger, better, bolder, and brighter than ever before. I just want to thank you all for being here. I'm so honored to have had this kind of a turnout, this kind of a record. I want to thank the American Farm Bureau for the incredible job they do. I'm proud to be a great friend of the farmer, of the rancher, of the people who so nobly do what you do. God bless you all. God bless our farmers. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.

We should just let it play, right? (Laughter.) We had a little luck with that song. And he's terrific , a good supporter. We appreciate it. We really appreciate this, too. I know you have a record crowd; that's nice. It's always nice to set records. And I want to thank Sonny. And he's setting records. We're setting records together for farmers and for agriculture. We've had so many good weeks and good days, and it's only going to get better because we're doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business, you're not even going to believe it. Your problem will be: 'What do we do? We need more acreage immediately. We got to plant.' But I will say, we are doing some things with trade that are going to have a tremendous impact. You're going to be doing business with Canada, you're going to be doing business with places where it was very, very difficult to do business. It was very unfair. And a lot of great things are going to happen. So, I want to really thank everybody here, and I want to congratulate a very, very good and exciting football team that I watched yesterday, the New Orleans Saints. (Applause.) You know, it's , I can see there's a little group over here. I know who I'm talking to. The rest of the room is going like, 'Eh, I don't want to talk about that.' (Laughter.) But you have to say, Drew Brees , he's one hell of a quarterback and it was a tremendous game. And so congratulations to the folks from this area and from this great state. (Applause.) It's a great state. I'm thrilled to be here in a state that I've had a lot of luck with , and I love a lot of people in this state; I know a lot of people , for, really, a truly historic occasion. This is the 100th annual convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation , 100 exactly. If it was 99 , although, I was here for 99, too, I have to be honest, right? I like the farmers. What can I do? I like farmers. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. For 100 years, this organization has faithfully represented the men and women who are the backbone of our country, truly. Let us all show our appreciation for a very dear friend and a leader , a great leader , Zippy Duval. Where's Zippy? Zippy. (Applause.) Where is, Zippy? What a job he does. He only called about 100 times to make sure I'm coming. (Laughter.) Thank you, Zippy. Great job. On this special anniversary, we gather to celebrate America's proud farming heritage. Through your sweat, through all of your work, the strength of your hands, and the faith in your hearts, the American farmer feeds, and fuels, and sustains our nation. So true. We are joined today by Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards. Thank you, Governor, for being here. Thank you. Thank you, John Bel. (Applause.) Thank you. Along with many members of Congress who are true champions of American agriculture. An incredibly talented man, a great doctor , he knows more about healthcare than anybody, and he's somebody that , he's really helped us out in so many different ways. And he's yours: Senator Bill Cassidy. Bill? Thank you very much, Bill. (Applause.) Appreciate it. A woman who had a tremendous victory , she came in for a short period of time. She was appointed, and it's always hard when you're appointed. If you look , I don't know about this, Cindy, but you take a look , they don't do too well. You did very well. You won in an incredible state: Mississippi. Cindy Hyde-Smith, thank you. That was a great win. (Applause.) A brilliant guy , he's very deceiving. My wife said, 'I love watching him on television.' And I said, 'Who?' 'John Kennedy.' I said, 'John Kennedy? I don't know.' But, you know, I thought maybe she was talking about the other John Kennedy. She was talking , this is a man who is totally brilliant. You know, I don't know if you know what this means: Oxford. Right? He went to Oxford. Oxford is a very , I'm very much into the world of schools. Oxford , you have to be very, very smart to go to Oxford. And he's very smart. He also loves this state. He loves the people. We gave a rally the night before he won that was incredible. And I looked , and I looked at that crowd. We had to have 40,000 people or more at a hangar , an airport hangar. I said, 'You know, John Kennedy? You're going to win.' And he won and he won big. And he's my friend. John Kennedy. Thank you, John. (Applause.) Oxford. 'Oxford John.' (Laughs.) Great. Congressman Ralph Abraham. Thank you, Congressman. Where are you? Congressman? (Applause.) Great job you do. He does a great job. Congressman Garrett Graves. And you know Garrett. Thank you, Garrett. Good job. Young, strong, smart. (Applause.) We got a lot of good politicians down here. And the legend from Louisiana , a man who's got a lot of courage. He was playing second base and it didn't work out so well for him that day, but I have never seen anybody with more strength and really more courage than Steve Scalise. Steve Scalise. (Applause.) He got hit hard. He got hit hard. He never even thought about quitting. He , I was there the night, in his hospital. And they didn't think he was going to make it. And I looked at him; he wasn't looking too good, I have to tell you. This is the first time I'm telling you this, Steve; you weren't looking too sharp. And his wife loves him, because she was a mess. She had tears pouring down. I'll tell you a couple of these little facts. Your family loves you, Steve. But all of a sudden, he started making a little progress, a little more. Worked so hard. And then, a few months ago, he was in a baseball game. And it was the Republicans against the Democrats. He's playing second base. And he didn't have great mobility, to be honest. In other words, moving like a foot to his right, a foot to the left , that was about it. And he gets the first pitch of the game. This is in a stadium, and a lot of people watching, and it's on television. And they put him at second base for one play. And the first hit is a smash , ground ball , hit at Steve. And I'm pretty good at this stuff; I look, I say, 'Oh, that's going right to second base.' It went right in him , right at him. He bent down, stopped that ball, threw it to first. The place went crazy. And he then walked off the field in great triumph. (Laughter and applause.) Who could have done that but my Steve, right? (Applause.) That was incredible. That was incredible. He's a courageous guy. He's a great guy. He's also a really fine person. So, Steve Scalise , what you've been through, Steve, is incredible. And congratulations. Incredible job. As you all know, there is currently a tremendous humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. It's tremendous. It's been there for years. It's been there for decades. But because of what we're doing and because of how well our country is doing , And please sit down. Please. I'm just looking , and then the media , the fake news , they'll say, 'He got no standing ovations.' You know why? Because everybody stayed standing. (Laughter.) Wait until you see that. It's true. Oh, they'll do it. They'll figure something out. (Applause.) That's true. (Applause.) That's true. (Laughs.) (Applause.) That's true. They can figure it out. They can take the best thing , I go home, I say, 'Darling, I did such a great job. Wait until you see the news tomorrow on something.' (Laughter.) North Korea, China. We're doing great in the trade deal. China , this, that. They can make anything you do look bad. But I was watching as you're standing. And I said, 'You know, if they sit, it's probably better for me, because every once in a while, they'll stand.' (Laughter.) The other way, they'll say, 'The crowd did not appreciate him. They didn't give him one standing ovation.' (Laughter.) Anyway, thank you very much. Women and children are being ruthlessly exploited at our southern border by vicious coyotes , who would think of this? Human traffickers. Now, when you hear the words 'human traffickers,' you think about 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago. You wouldn't think it's worse today in the world , this is a world problem , than it's ever been. And the reason it's worse is because of the Internet. They target young women. They target young children , the Internet. And they come in through our southern border into our country. And they'll have women taped , their mouths with duct tape, with electrical tape. They tape their face, their hair, their hands behind their back, their legs. They put them in the backseat of cars and vans, and they go , they don't come in through your port of entry because you'd see them. You couldn't do that. They come in through our border, where we don't have any barriers or walls. And they drive right in and they have no problems. And we'll get that stopped. We're going to have a wall. We're going to have a barrier. We're going to have something that's going to be very strong. (Applause.) One of the most important things. And I've built a lot of wall. You saw it the other day. They kept saying, 'You didn't build wall.' I said, 'I built wall.' So I actually decided I'd better put a picture for you to see. But we built a lot more than that. And we renovated a lot of pretty good stuff that we made good again. It was in very bad shape. But we've done a lot. We want to finish it because, you know, you can't have openings. Because if you have an opening, they go here and they just sort of go over this way. They find the open spot, they come in. And we have to build , what we have to build , probably a total of 550 miles including the renovations. And we've done a lot of work. People don't talk about it. I don't talk about it because, until we're finished, the big thing is we have to get it done. And we've had great support from John, your senator; Bill, your senator; from everybody. We've had tremendous , Steve is working hard in the House. Your congressmen are working really hard. Really hard. Because it's common sense. What we're talking about is common sense. Last month alone, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought across our borders. Twenty thousand. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the journey up from Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador. Think of that. Think of that. Hard to believe. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are being smuggled across the border. Most of the drugs coming into our country come in through the southern border , and much of it comes through areas that are not your portals , including meth, and cocaine, and heroin, and fentanyl. Heroin alone, if you look at the heroin epidemic , it's an epidemic , heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week. And 90 percent of it , at least , crosses our southern border. It comes in through our southern border. And I've spent a lot of time with Secret Service and with Border Patrol and ICE , incredible people , and they show me the methods that they use , how they hide it. They put it in hubcaps. They put it in engines. They put it in areas you wouldn't believe. They're brilliant, in many ways. They're brilliant. You wouldn't even think of what they do to get things in. And we can stop it. But we can't stop it if we're going to play politics. And the numbers you're talking about are peanuts compared , you'll make the money back numerous times a year. In 2017, drugs killed over 70,000 of our fellow citizens , think of that, that's like a football stadium loaded up , and imposed costs on our society in excess of $700 billion dollars. In the last two years, ICE officers arrested 266,000 illegal aliens , think of that , with criminal records, including 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent murders or killings. The crisis of illegal immigration impacts all Americans , threatening public safety, overwhelming public resources, straining our local schools and hospitals, undermining U.S. workers, and claiming countless innocent lives. And I will tell you, I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. They have to come in through a process. (Applause.) Thank you. As President, the defense of our nation is my highest and most important duty. And this is the defense of our nation, just like we prepare for other nations that you think more traditionally is what that sentence refers to. When it comes to keeping the American people safe, I will never, ever back down. I didn't need this fight. This is a rough fight. We're dealing against people who think that if they can stop me from building the wall , again, we've already done a lot of work , but they think that's a good thing for 2020, because they're not going to win. They think if they can stop me from building the wall, that's good. This is the reason why they don't want the wall built , because they all know it works. They all approved it numerous times. I mean, Chuck Schumer had his hand up every time this would come up. The senators know this. They're only doing this because of the 2020 election because I said I'll build the wall and I'm going to build the wall. And it's only one of many things that I promised. I mean, if you look at , (applause) , I got you the biggest tax cut , beyond the Ronald Reagan tax cuts. ANWR, getting rid of the individual mandate, the biggest cuts in regulations in the history of our country , and we're going further. (Applause.) That might be the biggest reason that our country is doing so much better than other countries and why we're doing so well. But they view this as a political thing because this was one of the big things I , I said, 'We're going to do tax cuts. We're going to do regulation. We're going to do ' And, you know, we've done most of what we said. One of the , that's a lot of news back there. One of the folks back there said that 'He's actually done more than he promised.' It's true. I have actually done more than I promised. We've done a lot. Even with the veterans. (Applause.) A lot of veterans in Louisiana. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Choice approved, which is pretty amazing. They've been trying to get that for years and years , decades and decades. And we got Accountability , VA Accountability. When you had somebody treating our veterans horribly, you couldn't do anything. You couldn't fire them , whether it's unions, or whether it's civil service, or whatever it may have been. But for decades and decades, somebody could do anything they wanted. They can steal, they could abuse our veterans, they can be sadists, they can do whatever they want and you couldn't fire them. And I got Accountability approved. Everyone said you couldn't get that , too much power against it. We got it done, and now we can say, 'Jim, you're fired. Get out of here. We don't want you taking care of our veterans.' (Applause.) That was a big thing. A lot of help from those people. So we got a lot done, but they view the wall as being a big item that, if I don't do it, you know, it's a negative. It's a negative. And I'm not doing it for that reason. I'm doing it because we have to do it. It's common sense. We have to do it. If you look at the caravans coming up, if you look at what's going on , you take a look. If we didn't have some of those walls , the military has been incredible. They came up and they built some barriers , they kept thousands and thousands of people from overrunning various sections of our country. We've done a great job at the border, but we need that extra , we need that barrier because you can't do this. You can have all the people you want dressed in military. You can have ICE. You can have Border Patrol. If you don't have that barrier, there's not a thing you can do. You know, they all say, 'We like technology.' I like technology, too. But we can have all the drones in the world flying around; we can have all the sensors in the world, but if you don't have a strong steel or concrete barrier, there's no way you're going to stop these people from rushing. Last week , and we have no idea who they are. And you got some , I'm sure , very good ones, but you got some real bad ones. Last week, I traveled to McAllen, Texas to tour the border and meet with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol. These great patriots made clear what they need from Congress and to end this terrible crisis. And we will end it. We will end it. You know, when we have proper security, people aren't going to come, except for the people we want to come because we want to take people in to help our farmers, et cetera. Very important. We're going to make that actually easier for them , to help the farmers. (Applause.) Because you need these people. No, you need these people. We're going to make it easier. (Applause.) I mean, I'm glad I told you that because, you know, look, you're in that business and a lot of people don't understand this. You need those , you need people to help you with the farms. And I'm not going to rule that out. I'm going to make that easier for them to come in and to work the farms. You've had some people for 20, 25 years. They're incredible. Then they go home and they can't get back in. That's not going to happen. But we're keeping the wrong ones out, okay? We don't want the wrong ones coming into our country. And, for that, it's going to be almost impossible to get in. For the people that work the farms, that have been here, that have gone through this very short but good process, that are going to help our country, it's going to be easier for them to get in that what they have to go through now. So just remember that. (Applause.) I know a lot about the farming world. And, if I don't, Sonny teaches me. They explained that there is no substitute for a wall , these are the ICE people and the Border Patrol people , or a physical barrier. There is no substitute. Where a barrier exists, illegal crossings plummet dramatically. In El Paso, they had , it was one of the most dangerous cities in the country. A wall was put up. It went from being one of the most dangerous cities in the country to one of the safest cities in the country overnight , overnight. Does that tell you something? (Applause.) And I can give you many examples of that. They say it's 'medieval' , a wall. It is medieval. So is a wheel. I always say 'a wheel.' But every time I look out, they all have wheels. You know, they may have gone electric and they may have done lots of different things, but every car I've seen still has wheels. (Laughter.) Wheels work and walls work. You know, there's some things you can't beat. (Applause.) That's why we've asked Congress to fund a steel barrier, or whatever you want to call it. This barrier will stop illegal activity, while directing lawful trade, travel, and commerce to our ports of entry. These ports are America's doors, but doors only work when you have strength. We need strength. Right now, we have weakness. They're forming a new caravan in Honduras. Honduras is not helping us. They could stop it. We send them hundreds of millions of dollars a year , El Salvador, Honduras, and other places , Guatemala , hundreds of millions, but they don't help us, like so many nations. We help them; they don't help us. We don't even get their votes often when we need their vote in the United Nations. They don't vote for us. Why? Because the wrong people are asking them. So those days are over. So I said just before I came , we're looking at a whole plan , why are we sending them money if they're allowing caravans to form right in the middle of their cities? Why are we sending them money? (Applause.) A lot of changes have been made in this country in less than two years, I will tell you that. A lot of changes. And really good changes , changes that people like you, with common sense and smarts, fully understand. And that's why we're liking where we are and the country is changing very rapidly for the better. As part of our overall border security plan, we have also asked Congress to approve cutting-edge technology to detect drugs. There's incredible technology today. So when these cars do come in through the ports of entry, you have technology today that's so incredible. We don't use it. We don't have it because our leaders decided not to spend the money. Well, you make it back every month , probably more than that , because the drugs coming through the southern border are destroying the fabric of our country. It's so bad. It's so bad. (Applause.) So we have to stop it. This technology is incredible. To fund more agents , we're putting that high on the list , officers, beds. Believe it or not, we're one of the only countries , I say 'one,' because every time I say something else they'll say, 'Oh, well, there was a country that also did it.' Somebody comes into our country, they touch one foot on the ground, and we have to catch them. It's called, 'catch.' We then take their names and we bring them to a court , can you believe this? , and we release them. But, see, we're trying to do 'catch-and-hold.' 'Catch-and-not-release.' But you have to release. So we release. And they go into our country, and then you announce , these are the laws , then you say, 'Come back in three years for your trial.' Tell me, what percentage of people come back? Would you say 100 percent? No, you're a little off. Like, how about 2 percent? (Laughter.) And those people, you almost don't want, because they cannot be very smart. (Laughter.) Two percent. Two percent. Two percent come back. Those two percent are not going to make America great again, that I can tell you. (Laughter and applause.) Crazy. So we have that and we have chain migration, where somebody comes in, and then his mother comes in, his father comes in, his grandmother comes in, his uncle comes in, his cousins come in. We had a guy , a radical Islamic terrorist in New York , area I know very well , driving down the West Side highway. Beautiful , Hudson River to his right. We built this gorgeous park all along the river. It's gorgeous. People are running; they're in great shape. We ought to all , some of these guys in the front row, they should do it with me. We could run. (Laughter.) Some of my friends over there. Sonny , maybe Sonny and I will go take a jog. (Laughter.) But you know what? I'll tell you, these are people that are great people, and they're running and they keep , and this horrible person, going down 60 miles an hour down a highway, decides, 'Oh, that's nice. We'll make a right turn.' Hits a whole group of people purposely, screaming all sorts of things that they scream. And 8 people died; 12 or 13 were injured. Nobody talks about the injured. You know, some of the injured lost legs, lost arms. You know, this is , they say, 'Oh, well, 12 were injured.' You know, like, injured , you think, like, a headache. No, no. They lost arms. They lost legs. One lost two legs. So 12 were horribly injured. And he's allowed to have his family come here. So they checked, and they said that he had about 22 people came in , chain migration. In other words, because he's here , so a whole group of people come in. And we don't want that. We have another one , the lottery. The lottery. We take people from countries through the lottery. Now, this is common sense. Do you think the country is giving us their finest? No, they're not. No, they're not. They're giving us the opposite of their finest. And we have a lottery system. 'Oh, let's pick him out. Oh, wonderful.' Doesn't work out too well, this lottery system. But this is the law. This was passed by Democrats and, I guess, Republicans. You know, maybe they voted , who knows? But these are laws that have to be changed. These are , these are sick, demented laws that we have to change. We can't allow this to keep happening. The people that are sent to our country are not the people that we want. They come in through the lottery. They come in through chain migration. Think of it: This man that killed 8 people and so badly injured 12, they say he's about 22 relatives coming in that are here. And take a look at how well his relatives are doing. It's not a good picture. So we have to change our laws. It's very hard because the Democrats don't want to change them. But I hope that common sense and people like this can persuade them, because it's gotten to a point where you have to. We really have no choice. And we're fighting hard. We're fighting very hard for you. We're making a lot of progress, I can tell you that. (Applause.) Here with us today is Jim Chilton from Arizona. Jim's ranch runs along the U.S-Mexico border. The deadly , very deadly , Sinaloa cartel, one of the most vicious drug cartels anywhere in the world, runs a major drug trafficking route right through Jim's ranch. Many of these routes used to run through San Diego until the wall was built by us, by me. (Applause.) Sorry about that, Jim. (Laughs.) I think Jim has just got angry at me; he just heard that. Sorry, Jim. Because now, what they did, they went to Jim's ranch. I think I cost him a lot of money. Maybe he won't stand up after all. But it's a very sad situation. In the last two years, the cameras on Jim's ranch have captured roughly 1,000 pictures of major drug packers, they call them. For years, these criminals have damaged Jim's property, injured his livestock, and started dozens of fire, which Jim estimates cost more than $2 million dollars in 2017 alone. Last June, a Border Patrol agent was checking sensors on the Clinton's , and Chilton's ranch when he was shot multiple times by these sinister drug traffickers. Multiple times. And they don't even think about. By the way, they shoot , it's not like, 'Oh, gee, I committed a terrible thing.' They don't even think about it. They don't even think. They wake up the next morning and they couldn't care less. As Jim has said, 'Every time I leave the ranch, my wife doesn't know whether I'll ever return.' I would like to ask Jim to come up and say a few words. Jim, please come up. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Jim. (Applause.) Thank you, Jim. And I'm sorry for your problems, but we'll get it straightened out. The government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: The Democrats will not fund border security, our safety, our national security. People come from many countries. When I was at the wall the other day, Border Patrol said they have 150 people they caught that day who weren't from Mexico. I said, 'That's a strange statement.' They said, 'No, these are the people that weren't from Mexico.' And I was surprised. Three were from Pakistan. Four were from another Mid-East , two Mid-East countries. And many of them were from other countries, including China , countries all over the world. A hundred and fifty of the people, as he said, were not from Mexico. Now, they caught many, many more, but that's a 150 people coming from companies that , you know, really, countries that you wouldn't believe. They will not approve the measures we need to keep America safe , the Democrats. We can't do that. We can't do that because this is of paramount importance to our country. And again, I could take it nice and easy. I could enjoy myself. I could relax. I've been in the White House because I think it's very important to be there. And other people went on a nice, wonderful vacation over the weekend. They had a great time. I would have loved to have been with them. I didn't like the look of it. I would have loved to have been with them. But we have a very big problem. This should have been done by other Presidents. Just like the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem should have been done , it was promised by many other Presidents. (Applause.) Just like we're doing the job on North Korea, just like we're doing the job with China , we're getting it done. We're getting it done. We're getting it all done. But it would have been nice if other administrations were able to do it. But we have to do the border. In the meantime, the USDA is doing everything in its power to help farmers deal with the ongoing shutdown. We thank you for your support and patriotism. And we fight to defend our nation. We are fighting very hard to defend our nation. And many people that aren't getting a payment, that aren't being paid, have let us know in the strongest of terms , a big amount , they said, 'Sir, what you're doing is of paramount importance. Do the job right, and we are with you, 100 percent.' You'd be surprised at how many people have said that. And it's not easy for them, but it's a lot of people. (Applause.) So I'm asking all of our citizens to call your Democrat lawmakers and ask them to pass a bill that secures our border, protects our country, and now reopens our government. Because as soon as they do that, we reopen our government. You would think that would be a very simple task. On every front, we are fighting for our great farmers, our ranchers, our growers. We are fixing broken trade deals that are horrible. I saw what was going on in Canada , the way you were treated. Horrible. And they treated their farmers great. Great. We changed it with the new trade deal we made with Mexico and Canada. And opening up new markets to export , many, many new markets are being opened up. We've eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations. And the farmers got hit probably as hard as anybody. We're reversing harmful federal intrusion. And to keep family farms in the family, we have virtually eliminated the estate tax, also known as the 'death tax.' (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Small business owners and corporations and others , small business , it was a terrible thing that was happening, where your parents , you love your parents , they're farmers , they love their farms. Everybody loves their farm. The kids , they want to grow up on the farm. They want to someday run the farm, own the farm. And they couldn't because they had very large estate taxes to pay. So they go out and borrow money, and then it turned a little bit bad. And all of the sudden, they'd end up losing the farm because they had to pay the estate tax. We got rid of it, folks. So if you love your children, you'll like me. If you don't love your children, and you weren't going to leave the farm to them, it probably doesn't matter too much, okay? (Laughter.) Does anybody here not love their children? Wow, that's a lot of people , not one? Okay, you don't want to say. That's all right. (Laughter.) That's like a lot of the people that went to the polls; they voted for Trump. (Laughter.) They said, 'We don't want to talk about it.' Then we won. We won two years ago. In November, we won. (Applause.) And everybody is trying , they're still trying to figure out what happened. We don't have to talk about it. We know what we're doing. We're ensuring that ethanol remains a vital part of America's energy future, with E-15. And we're making it available year round , all 12 months. That was a big, big difference for the farmers. (Applause.) Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst , your senators , a lot of great people were very strong on that. And it also creates additional, because, if you noticed, I think we saw $1.75 for gasoline today, coming in. I like to do that; I'm one of these guys. (Applause.) I'm riding in this incredible car, and I'm driving, and I'm looking at gas stations to see how much is the gas. How many other Presidents , you think Hillary Clinton would have done that? I don't think so. I don't think so. (Laughter and applause.) I'm in the Beast , the world's most expensive car. It's like being in an army tank that goes 50 miles an hour, right? I'm in the Beast and I'm looking at gas stations. I say, 'Fellas, slow up. I can't see.' (Laughter.) They say, '$1.75.' That didn't happen by accident, folks. That didn't happen by accident. People think it does; it doesn't. Nothing happens , very few, very little happens by accident. Nobody else would have done what we did for the farmers, with the estate taxes and so many other things. In the two years before my election, agricultural exports dropped by nearly $23 billion. Remember that: Before I got here, it was heading south. A lot of people say, 'Oh, gee, how are we doing?' It was going bad. If you go back 15 years, soybeans were more expensive 15 years ago than when I got into office. They were less. Now they're up nearly $14 billion. In December, just a few days before Christmas, I was proud to sign the Farm Bill. We got it done. That wasn't easy either. (Applause.) That was not easy. Senators, Congressmen, thank you. That group did it. (Applause.) That was not an easy one, John and Bill, was it, huh? That wasn't easy. But we got it done. The first to be passed, on time, in over 30 years. Got it done. And I've authorized Secretary Perdue to be strong on work rules for the Food Stamp program, through regulations allowed by the bill. So I know you have a great Secretary. He'll do what's right. The Farm Bill delivers for our farmers on a wide range of key priorities. On critical farm programs, such as crop insurance, you will have the support you need to plan for the future. It increases the amount farmers can borrow so you can expand and improve your businesses. It also secures the $600 million commitment we made to build a modern, effective, rural broadband across America's heartland. You're not well serviced. (Applause.) That's something the great, great middle part of our country has been complaining about for a long time. You're not properly serviced. You will be now. You will be now. That bill is a great bill for the farmer. Last year, when I spoke to you, we had just passed our historic tax cuts. Here with us today is Kalena Bruce from Stockton, Missouri. Kalena is a rancher, and also an accountant for local farmers. Under our new tax plan, which lowers rates for small businesses and doubles the tax child credit , so important, that child tax credit. You know who fought for that? A young woman named Ivanka Trump. That's all she wanted. 'Dad? Dad? We have to get that passed, Dad.' (Applause.) I said, 'Okay, Ivanka. Okay. Okay.' (Laughter.) It turned out to be so popular. Kalena has seen that many families will save upwards of $4,000 in taxes this year alone. Kalena, I want to thank you and all of those incredible people that you represent. And just keep up the great work. Where is Kalena? Where is Kalena? She's around here someplace. Hi, Kalena. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. (Applause.) We're also leading the most sweeping regulatory reform at any time in our history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture rolled back almost $400 million in regulatory costs last year alone. And this year, they're projected to more than double those savings. We're saving farmers and ranchers from one of the most ridiculous regulations ever imposed on anybody in our nation: the Waters of the United States rule. (Applause.) Disaster , other than the title. Such a beautiful title. It was a total kill on farmers, on builders, on everybody. It was a total kill. Sounds so nice. In fact, I looked at John Kennedy, when I signed that. I said, 'John, I'm going to get killed for this one.' Because what we did was take something , the 'Water of the United States.' How beautiful is that? And yet, everything inside was a total kill on you , and other businesses, by the way. (Applause.) And we didn't get killed, did we, John, huh? We didn't. They love it. So many people have come , and, you know, the time when I signed that bill, I had ranchers, farmers, and some homebuilders behind me. And these are tough people. They were strong, tough men and women. And half of them were crying because we basically , our government stole their property. They couldn't do anything. They couldn't build. They couldn't do anything. They were crying. I said, 'What are you crying about?' The one guy , I don't think he cried in his whole life. I don't think he cried when we was a baby. He was crying. (Laughter.) He said, 'Sir, you gave me back my life. You gave me back my property. They took it away , environmentally, took it away. And you're going to do the right thing.' In the audience today is Val Wagner from Monango, North Dakota. Val , (applause). (Laughs.) It's a good place. (Laughter.) You have a great new senator, by the way. (Applause.) A great new senator. Really great. Val and her husband would love to expand their farm for their four boys, but under the Waters of the United States rule, they would have to pay tens and of thousands of dollars in fines because of the 'prairie potholes' on their land. Do you all know what 'prairie potholes' are? Yes, you do. I don't, but it sounds bad. (Laughter.) To Val and to every farmer, we are going to keep federal regulators out of your , out of your tanks , your stock tanks, your drainage ditches, your puddles, and your ponds. And you know exactly what I'm talking about. You could have a pond , a little pond , and they consider it a lake. (Applause.) And you're regulated as though it were a lake. We're going to get government off your backs so you can earn a living and support your families doing what you love. And I know what you love. Farmers love what they're doing. (Applause.) We also passed legislation to rebuild our water infrastructure, including our nation's inland waterways, which carry more than 60 percent of our agricultural products. We are replacing one-sided, unfair trade deals. We have so many nations , it's a one-sided deal. With China, every year, for many years, we're losing $375 billion , not million, billion dollars. We're working on that very strongly. You see what's going on. We're doing very well. We have the European Union , they don't treat us right. They treat our farmers terribly. You can hardly sell into the , they have barriers and they have tariffs that are massive. But with the farmers, they don't want your product. We're working with them; they have to treat us fairly. We're losing $151 billion a year with the European Union. It sounds so nice, right? 'The European Union.' And then the press gets angry. They say, 'Donald Trump is not treating the European Union fairly.' Well, that's because they're not treating us fairly, folks. I want to be nice. In fact, they said my poll numbers are very bad in Europe. I said, 'They should be.' (Laughter.) No, seriously. They said, 'When he started off, he had 87 percent.' That means you could be the king of any country. Now, they (inaudible) because I'm representing our country; I'm not representing those country , you know, one of those (inaudible). (Applause.) True. It's true. They said, 'His poll numbers have tanked.' And I said, 'Oh, damn it. What's going on? Damn it.' And then I said, 'Oh, it's in Europe. That's okay.' (Laughter.) No, we get along well with them. And they're a lot of great people and great leaders. But, look, I'm not blaming them. I don't blame China. I mean, China , $375 billion a year, we lose. It's really more than that, but that's like the conservative number. I think it's $504 . But I'm giving you conservative because I don't want to be criticized for using wrong numbers, right? (Laughter.) But I don't blame China. I was in China making a speech, and President Xi , who's a friend of , great guy. But he represent them; I represent us. And he's sitting over here. And I'm talking to this massive crowd of people. And I'm talking about how China is bad, bad, bad. And I'm saying, 'Boy, this is , this could be dangerous.' (Laughter.) I'm in China. I'm in Beijing doing this. And I'm saying, 'I don't like this.' But I looked at him, and I realized , actually during that speech , it's not his fault or their fault. It's our fault for allowing that to happen. It's our leaders' fault. (Applause.) Over the last 15 years, we've seen a continual decline in the U.S. share of agricultural trade all throughout the world. You know that. It was all going in the wrong direction. It's changing now. Wait until you see what happens. If we do the right deal with China, you're talking about massive , they're already backordering, right? They're already back. I told them. I said, 'You got to start ordering. You're going to order.' They're going to order, and they've already started. We're turning all of that around with fair trade deals that put American farmers, ranchers, and, in fact, put America first. That's what I'm interested in: America first. (Applause.) We just opened Argentina to American pork exports , pork , for the first time in a quarter of a century. They needed something; I said, 'You have to open it up to pork.' And they said, 'Okay.' I said, 'Why didn't you do it before?' They said, 'Nobody ever asked us.' (Laughter.) A lot of it is that. You would be amazed. Nobody ever asks. India and Morocco have both opened their markets to our poultry exports. We do so much for them. It's incredible. Japan opened its market to U.S. exports of potatoes from Idaho , (applause) , and lamb from the great state of Texas, yes. No, they just opened up. We asked them. We said, 'You got to open up. Sorry.' U.S. beef has been shipped to Brazil for the first time since 2003. They're going to have a great new leader. They say he's the Donald Trump of South America. Do you believe that? (Applause.) And he's happy with that. If he wasn't, I wouldn't like the country so much. But I like him. And we opened China to American beef for the first time in many, many years. We've taken , (applause). You know that. But that was before the trade deal. Don't even worry about it. This is , that's peanuts compared to what we're talking about. We've taken the toughest-ever actions to confront China's unfair trade practices that hurt American farmers and ranchers. This includes China's theft of trade secrets from American agri-business. I couldn't believe how complicated your business is , with the seeds and the genetic farming. It's incredible. People don't know this. But your secrets were being stolen by China, and, in all fairness, other countries. We want a fair deal for American farmers , removing China's arbitrary bans on agricultural imports, safeguarding our intellectual property, and providing fair market access to all American producers. We have also made history by finalizing an agreement to replace the horrible NAFTA with a brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, called the 'USMCA.' A whole different world. A whole different world. (Applause.) NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever made by a country. It killed our country. This landmark trade deal will increase exports of wheat from Montana, dairy from Wisconsin, chicken from Georgia, and products from farmers and ranchers all across our country.As part of the USMCA, Canada agreed to give fair treatment to American wheat farmers. They will now grade American wheat just like they grade their own wheat. (Applause.) Which, to me, doesn't mean much, but, to farmers, it means a lot. That's what they tell me. I said, 'What can we do?' They said that would be a big thing , on wheat. Even the NFL , you know, the NFL, for many years, was having a hard time with Canada, having to do with the Super Bowl. I heard about it, and I asked about it. And it was a lot of money, but it was tiny compared to the overall deal with Canada and with Mexico. So, as one of the things, I said, 'You got to treat the NFL fairly.' You know, it's a great American company. And we had the dispute over the National Anthem, and that seems to have worked out properly, which is great, which I give them credit for now. And I said, 'Listen, when you go to Canada, you're going to ask for this thing because they're not treating our company right.' Any company , I don't care, but that was the NFL. A big company. A great American company. I said, 'You're not treating them well.' We asked for it; in one minute, we solved a problem that they've been working on for many years. Total success. And they called up, and they thanked me. But it's something that I want to do for American companies. It's easy, it's short, it took a few minutes, and we got it. They were fighting for years. Canada also agreed to end unfair trade practices that hurt American dairy exports. Also here today are Cris and Gary Peterson, and their son Ben and daughter-in-law Nicki. More than 140 years ago, Gary's great-grandmother began their farm in a tremendous state , I love this state. Remember when they say, 'Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin'? That state hasn't been won by a Republican in so long. Bill, you don't remember any wins there, right? That was a long time ago. That was even before your time. Right, Bill? A long time. And they said, 'Donald Trump ' Remember that? Was that a great evening or what? 'Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin.' (Applause.) We love Wisconsin. Today, the Petersons have more than 900 dairy cows. Like so many of our great farmers, the Petersons have faced a number of threats to their farm and to their entire way of life. For years, NAFTA made it difficult for dairy farmers like the Petersons to export milk, ice cream, cheese, and many other dairy products. Under the USMCA, the Peterson family will finally have the level playing field that they should have had for many years. They have it now. Together, we urge Congress to support American agriculture, stand up for American workers, and hopefully they will approve the USMCA quite quickly. You know, the one thing I worry about , it's almost , no matter how good something is, they might not want to approve it, but they'll approve it. This one , I think it's going to be very tough for them not. But I think that , I hear it's in very good shape. And it replaces something that has been so bad to our country. This is a great deal. As we reverse the damage of decades of unfair trade, we are also providing up to $12 billion in relief to protect our farmers from unfair foreign retaliation. And you saw that recently with Sonny Perdue, where we were helping out during a very unfair period of time when people were actually trying to affect our election. Nobody brings that up. In this case, it was China. I haven't heard too much about that. Have you heard anything about that? But they were. And we helped our farmers out. No one understands better than our great farmers that the tough choices we make today reap rewards for centuries to come.More than 200 years ago, this very city was at the center of America's negotiations during the legendary Louisiana Purchase.No one knew how it would all turn out, but President Thomas Jefferson acted decisively for the American people. After months of negotiations, we got what no one ever imagined possible. Not only did we gain New Orleans, we doubled the size of the United States; we secured new parts and ports , new parts of the map and globe that we never thought, and new ports, very importantly for American agriculture; and we made our nation the greatest farm country on God's Earth. And it remains that. And it's now, for the first time in a long time, getting better. (Applause.) Our nation was founded, settled, and built by farmers. (Applause.) From the fields of Pennsylvania to the hills of Tennessee , (applause); from the plains of Missouri , (applause) , to the Big Sky of Montana , (applause); and from the marshes of Florida , (applause) , to the fertile valley of California , (applause) , farmers have always led the way. (Applause.) The American farmer embodies the timeless values of America. You believe in hard work and self-reliance. You follow the rules, obey our laws, and respect our great American flag. (Applause.) You support our communities, raise loving families, teach your children right from wrong, and you are always loyal to this magnificent nation that we so love. Now you have a government that is loyal to you, finally, in return. (Applause.) Because we know that government's first duty is to our own citizens. We are fighting for the American farmer, and we are fighting for the American Dream, and for products made and grown with pride right here in the USA. It's what we're fighting for. (Applause.) We are defending a cherished legacy, and we are preserving a beautiful way of life passed down from mothers and fathers to sons and daughters, from generation to generation. You are the keepers of this noble tradition. You are the guardians of this majestic heritage. We are standing up for the men and women who work the fields, till the soil, and harvest the land. We are protecting your rights, your freedoms, and our glorious Constitution.And we are doing it all with love in our hearts, joy in our souls, and trust in our God. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. To all of the farmers here today and across our country, the greatest harvest is yet to come. The future for America's farmers is bigger, better, bolder, and brighter than ever before. I just want to thank you all for being here. I'm so honored to have had this kind of a turnout, this kind of a record. I want to thank the American Farm Bureau for the incredible job they do. I'm proud to be a great friend of the farmer, of the rancher, of the people who so nobly do what you do. God bless you all. God bless our farmers. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. (Applause.)"}

During National School Choice Week, we reaffirm our commitment to enable all students to pursue the education that will best equip them for success in work and life. Every child deserves the chance to flourish in an educational environment that best leverages their unique learning style, cultivates their talent, and develops the skills needed to succeed in an ever-changing world. Likewise, teachers deserve the chance to innovate in the classroom and do their best work. Yet, today's system often falls short of what students and teachers need and deserve, and often makes it too hard for families and educators to create the best learning experience for each child. The results tell the unfortunate story: recent international surveys ranked the United States 24th in reading, 25th in science, and 40th in math. These results were not the result of incapable children; they were the consequence of the limitations imposed by a largely one\u2011size-fits-all approach to education. Education should inspire wonder, stimulate curiosity, and spark a lifelong desire in our children to learn and grow. Increased educational options , including through out-of-zone public schools, public charter schools, magnet schools, sectarian and secular private schools, home schools, and online education programs , have expanded opportunities for students regardless of background or economic status. We should all work to ensure all children receive great educations, regardless of where they live, how much their family makes, or how they best learn. My Administration knows that choice in education plays a vital role in the success of our children and our country. The number of students receiving a D.C. Opportunity Scholarship has increased by nearly 50 percent under my Administration. In last year's enactment of the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we improved 529 plans so that they may cover elementary and secondary school tuition. Family demand for public charter schools has continued to grow. And, importantly, we have encouraged States, local communities, and families to refocus education policy where it belongs , on what is best for each child. We commend our Nation's families, teachers, school leaders, and all those who nobly dedicate their lives to educating the next generation. My Administration will continue to stand with students and their families in the fight for the best educational opportunities for their children. As our Nation celebrates National School Choice Week, I encourage families to explore new educational opportunities; I urge educators to develop imaginative and innovative pathways to learning; and I challenge students to passionately pursue their goals and dreams with discipline, integrity, and unyielding determination. Lastly, I urge lawmakers in Congress and in the States to embrace and expand education choice, which will strengthen our students, families, educators, communities, and ultimately, our great Nation.

{"SpeechID":"VSDT1912019313","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2019-01-19","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump on the Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border and the Shutdown","Type":"statement","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: Just a short time ago, I had the honor of presiding over the swearing-in of five new great American citizens. It was a beautiful ceremony and a moving reminder of our nation's proud history of welcoming legal immigrants from all over the world into our national family. I told them that the beauty and majesty of citizenship is that it draws no distinctions of race, or class, or faith, or gender or background. All Americans, whether first generation or tenth generation, are bound together in love and loyalty, friendship and affection. We are all equal. We are one team, and one people, proudly saluting one great American flag. We believe in a safe and lawful system of immigration, one that upholds our laws, our traditions, and our most cherished values. Unfortunately, our immigration system has been badly broken for a very long time. Over the decades, many Presidents and many lawmakers have come and gone, and no real progress has been made on immigration. We are now living with the consequences , and they are tragic , brought about by decades of political stalemate, partisan gridlock, and national neglect. There is a humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border that requires urgent action. Thousands of children are being exploited by ruthless coyotes and vicious cartels and gangs. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north. In fact, many loving mothers give their young daughters birth control pills for the long journey up to the United States because they know they may be raped or sexually accosted or assaulted. Nearly 50 migrants a day are being referred for urgent medical care. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are flooding through our border and into our communities, including meth, cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl. Drugs kill 78,000 Americans a year and cost our society in excess of $700 billion. Heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week, 90 percent of which comes across our southern border. We can stop heroin. Illegal immigration reduces wages and strains public services. The lack of border control provides a gateway , and a very wide and open gateway , for criminals and gang members to enter the United States, including the criminal aliens who murdered a brave California police officer only a day after Christmas. I've gotten to know and love Angel moms, dads, and family who lost loved ones to people illegally in our country. I want this to end. It's got to end now. These are not talking points. These are the heartbreaking realities that are hurting innocent, precious human beings every single day on both sides of the border. As a candidate for President, I promised I would fix this crisis, and I intend to keep that promise one way or the other. Our immigration system should be the subject of pride, not a source of shame, as it is all over the world. Our immigration system should be the envy of the world, not a symbol of disunity and dysfunction. The good news is, these problems can all be solved but only if we have the political courage to do what is just and what is right. Both sides in Washington must simply come together, listen to each other, put down their armor, build trust, reach across the aisle, and find solutions. It is time to reclaim our future from the extreme voices who fear compromise and demand open borders, which means drugs pouring in, human trafficking, and a lot of crime. That is why I am here today, to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis on the southern border. If we are successful in this effort, we will then have the best chance in a very long time at real, bipartisan immigration reform. And it won't stop here. It will keep going until we do it all. The proposal I will outline today is based on, first and foremost, on input from our border agents and homeland security professionals , and professionals they are. They know what they're doing. It is a compassionate response to the ongoing tragedy on our southern border. In recent weeks, we have met with large numbers of Democrat lawmakers to hear their ideas and suggestions. By incorporating the priorities of rank-and-file Democrats in our plan, we hope they will offer their enthusiastic support. And I think many will. This is a commonsense compromise both parties should embrace. The radical left can never control our borders. I will never let it happen. Walls are not immoral. In fact, they are the opposite of immoral because they will save many lives and stop drugs from pouring into our country. Our plan includes the following: $800 million in urgent humanitarian assistance; $805 million for drug detection technology to help secure our ports of entry; an additional 2,750 border agents and law enforcement professionals; 75 new immigration judge teams to reduce the court backlog of, believe it or not, almost 900,000 cases. However, the whole concept of having lengthy trials for anyone who sets one foot in our country unlawfully must be changed by Congress. It is unsustainable. It is ridiculous. Few places in the world would even consider such an impossible nightmare. Our plan includes critical measures to protect migrant children from exploitation and abuse. This includes a new system to allow Central American minors to apply for asylum in their home countries, and reform to promote family reunification for unaccompanied children, thousands of whom wind up on our border doorstep. To physically secure our border, the plan includes $5.7 billion for a strategic deployment of physical barriers, or a wall. This is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea. These are steel barriers in high-priority locations. Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water. We already have many miles of barrier, including 115 miles that we are currently building or under contract. It will be done quickly. Our request will add another 230 miles this year in the areas our border agents most urgently need. It will have an unbelievable impact. If we build a powerful and fully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border, the crime rate and drug problem in our country would be quickly and greatly reduced. Some say it could be cut in half. Because these criminals, drug smugglers, gangs, and traffickers do not stop at our border; they permeate throughout our country and they end up in some places where you'd least expect them. They go all over our country. A steel barrier will help us stop illegal immigration while safely directing commerce to our lawful ports of entry. Many of these security ideas have been proposed by Democrats themselves, and all of them have been supported by Democrats in the past, including a physical barrier, wall, or fence. Furthermore, in order to build the trust and goodwill necessary to begin real immigration reform, there are two more elements to my plan. Number one is three years of legislative relief for 700,000 DACA recipients brought here unlawfully by their parents at a young age many years ago. This extension will give them access to work permits, Social Security numbers, and protection from deportation, most importantly. Secondly, our proposal provides a three-year extension of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS. This means that 300,000 immigrants whose protected status is facing expiration will now have three more years of certainty so that Congress can work on a larger immigration deal, which everybody wants , Republicans and Democrats. And our farmers and vineyards won't be affected because lawful and regulated entry into our country will be easy and consistent. That is our plan: border security, DACA, TPS, and many other things. Straightforward, fair, reasonable, and common sense, with lots of compromise. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pledged to bring this bill to a vote this week in the United States Senate. Our proposal is not intended to solve all of our immigration challenges. This plan solves the immediate crisis , and it is a horrible crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis like we rarely see in our country. And it provides humanitarian relief, delivers real border security, and immediately reopens our federal government. If we are successful in this effort, then we can start the border [broader] project of remaking our immigration system for the 21st century. Once the government is open and we have made a down payment on border security, and immigration reform starts to happen, I plan to convene weekly bipartisan meetings at the White House so we can do a finished product, a great product , a product that we can all be proud of, having to do with that elusive immigration problem. Whatever we do, I can promise you this: I will never forget that my first duty, and ultimate loyalty, is to you, the American people. Any reforms we make to our immigration system will be designed to improve your lives, make your communities safer, and make our nation more prosperous and secure for generations to come. Thank you and God bless America. Thank you.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1317270\/remarks-by-president-trump-on-the-humanitarian-crisis-on-our-southern-border-and-the-shutdown&speechType=6","Summary":"National Security Immigration","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-humanitarian-crisis-southern-border-shutdown\/","CleanText":"Just a short time ago, I had the honor of presiding over the swearing-in of five new great American citizens.

Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are flooding through our border and into our communities, including meth, cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl. Drugs kill 78,000 Americans a year and cost our society in excess of $700 billion. Heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week, 90 percent of which comes across our southern border. We can stop heroin. Illegal immigration reduces wages and strains public services. The lack of border control provides a gateway , and a very wide and open gateway , for criminals and gang members to enter the United States, including the criminal aliens who murdered a brave California police officer only a day after Christmas. I've gotten to know and love Angel moms, dads, and family who lost loved ones to people illegally in our country. I want this to end. It's got to end now. These are not talking points. These are the heartbreaking realities that are hurting innocent, precious human beings every single day on both sides of the border. As a candidate for President, I promised I would fix this crisis, and I intend to keep that promise one way or the other. Our immigration system should be the subject of pride, not a source of shame, as it is all over the world. Our immigration system should be the envy of the world, not a symbol of disunity and dysfunction. The good news is, these problems can all be solved but only if we have the political courage to do what is just and what is right. Both sides in Washington must simply come together, listen to each other, put down their armor, build trust, reach across the aisle, and find solutions. It is time to reclaim our future from the extreme voices who fear compromise and demand open borders, which means drugs pouring in, human trafficking, and a lot of crime. That is why I am here today, to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis on the southern border. If we are successful in this effort, we will then have the best chance in a very long time at real, bipartisan immigration reform. And it won't stop here. It will keep going until we do it all. The proposal I will outline today is based on, first and foremost, on input from our border agents and homeland security professionals , and professionals they are. They know what they're doing. It is a compassionate response to the ongoing tragedy on our southern border. In recent weeks, we have met with large numbers of Democrat lawmakers to hear their ideas and suggestions. By incorporating the priorities of rank-and-file Democrats in our plan, we hope they will offer their enthusiastic support. And I think many will. This is a commonsense compromise both parties should embrace. The radical left can never control our borders. I will never let it happen. Walls are not immoral. In fact, they are the opposite of immoral because they will save many lives and stop drugs from pouring into our country. Our plan includes the following: $800 million in urgent humanitarian assistance; $805 million for drug detection technology to help secure our ports of entry; an additional 2,750 border agents and law enforcement professionals; 75 new immigration judge teams to reduce the court backlog of, believe it or not, almost 900,000 cases. However, the whole concept of having lengthy trials for anyone who sets one foot in our country unlawfully must be changed by Congress. It is unsustainable. It is ridiculous. Few places in the world would even consider such an impossible nightmare. Our plan includes critical measures to protect migrant children from exploitation and abuse. This includes a new system to allow Central American minors to apply for asylum in their home countries, and reform to promote family reunification for unaccompanied children, thousands of whom wind up on our border doorstep. To physically secure our border, the plan includes $5.7 billion for a strategic deployment of physical barriers, or a wall. This is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea. These are steel barriers in high-priority locations. Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water. We already have many miles of barrier, including 115 miles that we are currently building or under contract. It will be done quickly. Our request will add another 230 miles this year in the areas our border agents most urgently need. It will have an unbelievable impact. If we build a powerful and fully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border, the crime rate and drug problem in our country would be quickly and greatly reduced. Some say it could be cut in half. Because these criminals, drug smugglers, gangs, and traffickers do not stop at our border; they permeate throughout our country and they end up in some places where you'd least expect them. They go all over our country. A steel barrier will help us stop illegal immigration while safely directing commerce to our lawful ports of entry. Many of these security ideas have been proposed by Democrats themselves, and all of them have been supported by Democrats in the past, including a physical barrier, wall, or fence. Furthermore, in order to build the trust and goodwill necessary to begin real immigration reform, there are two more elements to my plan. Number one is three years of legislative relief for 700,000 DACA recipients brought here unlawfully by their parents at a young age many years ago. This extension will give them access to work permits, Social Security numbers, and protection from deportation, most importantly. Secondly, our proposal provides a three-year extension of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS. This means that 300,000 immigrants whose protected status is facing expiration will now have three more years of certainty so that Congress can work on a larger immigration deal, which everybody wants , Republicans and Democrats. And our farmers and vineyards won't be affected because lawful and regulated entry into our country will be easy and consistent. That is our plan: border security, DACA, TPS, and many other things. Straightforward, fair, reasonable, and common sense, with lots of compromise. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pledged to bring this bill to a vote this week in the United States Senate. Our proposal is not intended to solve all of our immigration challenges. This plan solves the immediate crisis , and it is a horrible crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis like we rarely see in our country. And it provides humanitarian relief, delivers real border security, and immediately reopens our federal government. If we are successful in this effort, then we can start the border project of remaking our immigration system for the 21st century. Once the government is open and we have made a down payment on border security, and immigration reform starts to happen, I plan to convene weekly bipartisan meetings at the White House so we can do a finished product, a great product , a product that we can all be proud of, having to do with that elusive immigration problem. Whatever we do, I can promise you this: I will never forget that my first duty, and ultimate loyalty, is to you, the American people. Any reforms we make to our immigration system will be designed to improve your lives, make your communities safer, and make our nation more prosperous and secure for generations to come. Thank you and God bless America. Thank you."}

Estabraq Adel Al Sayyad came with her husband to the United States , please. That's a good idea. I wasn't going to do that, but I like that. Please. (Laughter.) That's very nice. With her husband to the United States from Iraq in 2013. She is the proud mother of two children and is expecting a third. Since coming to America, she has become a teacher's assistant in our public schools , doing a fantastic job, I might add , preparing the next generation of young Americans to make the most of this magnificent country that she, too, now enjoys.

He is an Anglican pastor who came to the United States in 2006 and earned a master's degree from Gordon Conwell Seminary in North Carolina. A fine place. His grandmother was an American citizen whose ancestors first came to North America in 1637 , that means you beat us , (laughter) , you beat all of us , as part of the Plymouth Colony. Now the Hemsley family history to the United States is renewed, and the next chapter of their American story begins. Matthew, it's an honor. Great luck. Great luck. (Applause.) Yook Young Choi is from South Korea and came to the United States in 1992 to pursue a master's degree.

Marcelo, thank you very much. (Applause.) You're all at the beginning of a new and extraordinary adventure. With the rights and freedoms you enjoy as Americans, there is nothing you cannot achieve. But citizenship is also a profound responsibility. Each year, over 700,000 new Americans take the oath and allegiance, and inherit a legacy of liberty and justice that generations of Americans fought and died to secure. By taking this oath, you have forged a sacred bond with this nation, its traditions, its culture, and its values. This heritage is now yours to protect, promote, and pass down to the next generation and to the next wave of newcomers to our shores. Our history is now your history. Our traditions are now your traditions. And our Constitution is now yours to safeguard, celebrate, and cherish.

We must look out for each other, care for each other, and always act in the best interests of our nation and all citizens living here today. We love each other. We're proud of each other. The beauty and majesty of citizenship is that it draws no distinctions of race, or class, or faith, or gender or background.

Again, I want to congratulate you and welcome you to the family. It's a family. It's a beautiful family. It's a family doing very well. We're setting records economically.

{"SpeechID":"VSDT2412019310","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2019-01-24","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump in a Meeting with Republican Members of Congress on the United States Reciprocal Trade  ...","Type":"statement","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: Another day in paradise, right? (Laughter.) A good day. A good day. This is the United States Reciprocal Trade Act that this room is very enthused about, that a lot of people are very enthused about. We're taken advantage of by many, many countries all over the world. They charge us tariffs and taxe , the likes of which nobody has any understanding, they're so high and so unfair. They also have barriers where we can't go in. They have trade barriers that make it impossible for us to sell our farm products and our other products or cars in those places. So this is the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, and it's really a preliminary meeting. It's a little bit of an early meeting. We're going to be talking about it. We have tremendous support, and we're going to find out what happens. It should have been done many years ago, as many things should have been done many years ago. Frankly, the wall should have been built many years ago; we wouldn't have the problems that we have today. So I'm pleased to welcome Republican members of Congress to the White House. I especially want to thank Congressman Sean Duffy for sponsoring one of the top legislative priorities, to my way of thinking, that you can have. It's called \"fairness,\" really. The United States Reciprocal Trade Act , this legislation will help finally to give our workers a fair and level playing field against other countries. Countries are taking advantage of us, whether they think we're very nice or not so smart. They've been doing it for many, many years, and we want to end it. Many of these are friends. Many of these are allies. But sometimes allies take advantage of us even more so than our non-allies. All over the world, foreign countries put massive tariffs on our products while we put very few, if any, on theirs. So we then wonder why we're not doing the business we should be doing. And we wonder, maybe most importantly, why we had, last year, over an $800 trillion trade deficient , $800 billion, in terms of a trade deficit. So when you have a number like $800 billion, you say to yourself, \"Somebody made a lot of bad deals.\" And that's happened over a long period of time. The Reciprocal Trade Act will give us the tools to solve this problem once and for all. In addition to the various trade deals that we're working on with Mexico, Canada, China , South Korea, we just finished. It's a good deal. Made it a good deal. It was a terrible deal, and we made it into a good deal. We'll get the trade way down and we'll get the deficits way down. Under the U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act, whatever the tariffs for a foreign country is, we place the same tariff on us. So if somebody is charging , and I brought a chart. If somebody is charging us 100 percent tariff, and we're charging them nothing, we're entitled to charge the same tariff as them. And what's going to happen, I think, from a practical standpoint, is they won't be charging us tariffs anymore. We'll see. Or we'll charge them a lot. It's a tremendous amount of money. It's a tremendous problem for our country. The U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act will be an incredible tool to bring foreign countries to the negotiating table and to get them to lower their tariffs on our products and also to get rid of their trade barriers, making it really impossible for us to do business. India, as an example, has a 150 percent , hard to believe , tariff on whiskey. They make whiskey, and they sell it to us. We charge them zero. We sell it to them; they charge us 150 percent. So I would say, other than that, it's a very fair deal. Okay? (Laughter.) That's the least of it. We have far worse than that. The EU charges us 67 percent tariff on pork, and we charge them almost nothing. And they make it very hard for us to sell pork in the EU. For bulldozers, Malaysia charges us, as an example, 20 percent, and Indonesia charges us a lot. We charge them all nothing. We charge them nothing. Very unfair to our companies. Very unfair to our workers. So if countries refuse to lower their barriers, then we will simply place a matching tariff on their product. It's very simple. It's the simplest thing that you can do. The result will be more countries will remove their barriers and open their markets to American exports, to American farmers, to American manufacturers. I will be talking a lot about reciprocal trade over the next six years. Hopefully, we'll have it done in two years or less. And we will see deficits down to a level that would really , you know, we talk about \"Make America Great Again\"; we have to do these things to make America great again. Because we can't lose almost $800 billion on trade, like has been done for many years. And it's been numbers , they varied anywhere from $300 billion to over $800 billion. Can't do that. And what we're doing with China, I think, will have a tremendous impact, if you look at the numbers that we're talking about. We'll see how that all comes out. But, as you know, we're charging tremendous tariffs now, and they go up, as of March 1st, very substantially. I think China would like to make a deal. We'd like to make a deal. I like exactly where we are right now, to be honest with you. We're very happy. We have billions of dollars coming into our Treasury , billions , from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our Treasury; now we have billions coming in. But if we could make a deal that'll be great , on intellectual property, and theft, and all of the other things we're talking about, in addition to taxes themselves. So I'll be talking a lot about this over the next period of time, and I want to just thank the incredible people , all friends of mine. They are , this is a very early meeting. This is the beginning of something, I think, that's going to be very important for our country. And I look forward to discussing it. They did a chart, right here, where, as an example, these are , and these are not big abuses. You look at apples. Japan, foreign tariff , 17 percent. The United States , nothing. We get nothing; they get 17. The same apple. Actually, ours are better, you want to know the truth. (Laughter.) So that makes it even worse. I don't want to cover you up. You're such a good-looking guy, REPRESENTATIVE ADERHOLT: No, you're good. You're good. THE PRESIDENT: He's a handsome man. I don't want to cover him up. Autos, China , you have a 15 percent tariff, and the U.S. has 2.5. So when you sell , and, by the way, we got the autos down from 40 in China. I got them down to 15. But it's still 15 percent versus 2.5 percent. But, if you know, it was 40 and 25 percent. We got them down to 15, but that's really not good enough because we have 15 versus 2.5 percent. And we don't even get the 2.5 percent. There are ways that they can eliminate that. French fries , one of our favorite meals. (Laughter.) French fries from Thailand , 30 percent. We get 8 percent. You look at the numbers. Go down , look at motorcycles, as an example. India , 50 percent. It was 100 percent. I got them down to 50 percent just by talking for about two minutes. But it's still 50 percent versus 2.4 percent. Again, other than that, it's a very fair deal. Pork, EU , pretty much zero. And it's 67 percent. So you look at that, and something like whiskey from India, and other things from India , India is a very high tariff. They charge us a lot of tariffs. But you look at whiskey. So India gets 150 percent, and we get nothing. I will tell you that those are just a few of the products. It's actually much worse than that, as bad as that sounds. And all we're saying , if you're going to charge us 150 percent, we're going to charge you 150 percent. And what will happen, in many cases, is we'll both charge each other nothing or we'll get 150 percent. That's okay, too. I spoke to a couple senators about this that are really into this stuff, and they said, \"Hey, sounds fair to me.\" And a lot of people think it's fair. We have to get foreign countries to respect us again, both militarily and on trade. And I tell you, we have come a long way in two years. It's a whole different ballgame. When you look at what's happened, it's a whole different ballgame. So this is the Reciprocal Trade Act, and I think that it's something that's going to , you're going to hear a lot about it. And, you know, hard to believe , you'll have people that are against it. You'll have people say that we don't mind if a country charges us 50 percent, 100 percent, 250 percent. We have some cases, like with butter , Sean was telling me , in Wisconsin. Do you want to tell that story? The difference? REPRESENTATIVE DUFFY: Yeah, so Europe charges us 68 percent tariffs on our Wisconsin butter, and we charge 2.8 percent on European butter. It's totally unfair. It's not right. THE PRESIDENT: Mister great hockey player, congratulations on your victory. We worked hard, right? REPRESENTATIVE STAUBER: Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: That was a great job. Great job. Thank you. REPRESENTATIVE STAUBER: We appreciate your support. THE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) Thank you very much. Congratulations. So thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Q (Inaudible) with this idea of the temporary spending measure to reopen the government, allow federal workers to , THE PRESIDENT: Well, one of the ideas suggested is they open it, they pay a , sort of a prorated down payment for the wall, which I think people agree that you need. You need the wall. In fact, I see a lot of the Democrats are all , almost all of them are breaking and saying, \"Look, walls are good. Walls are good.\" Big difference from what you had two or three weeks ago. And the vote , we had the vote on our bill, which we won 50-47. That was our bill. But we got one Democrat. It was 50-47. And we need , as you know, we have to get 60. We don't have 60 votes, so we need Democrat support. We didn't get Democrat support, other than from a , actually, a wonderful man, as you know , Senator Manchin. And he's doing the right thing for his people. I mean, he's doing the right thing for West Virginia, frankly. And the other bill , it was 52-44. And that included a lot of hurricane relief for a lot of different states. So it's sort of not something , some of them really voted for the hurricane relief, which they felt they needed. That was 52-44. But you need 60. So that didn't go anywhere. So we knew they both were not going to go anywhere, we thought. And now Mitch is negotiating with Chuck Schumer, and we'll see what happens. I think they just left a meeting. They just had a meeting. I think they're going to have to see their people. But they just left. So we have two bills. I think we did very well. The Republicans held. Except for two, the Republicans held. Two were not there. They couldn't , they weren't able to be there, so there were two non-votes. But even with two non-votes, I think they would have been good votes for us. It's 50-47; we won. But we need 60 votes because of the 60-vote rule. And so I just really want to thank the Republicans for holding. Again, on the other one, that was the opening up. That's 52-44, but you need 60 votes. So it's a long way short. And a lot of that , a lot of those votes were based on the fact that there was hurricane relief for certain states. Q (Inaudible) temporary spending without money for the wall, which is just to reopen the government , THE PRESIDENT: Well, I wouldn't be happy with it. I wouldn't be happy. But we have a lot of alternatives. Honestly, we have , everybody , look, for the most part, people agree , when I say \"everybody,\" I would say almost everybody agrees we have to have border security. We have to have a wall in order to have border security. You cannot have border security without a wall. I mean, we can play games, and we can talk about technology. We can talk about drones flying around. You know, right now, formed, is an 8,000-person caravan. And the caravan is heading our way. Congratulations. We have another one. We stopped the first one. We stopped the second one. I wouldn't say that Tijuana is too happy, but they're happily living in Tijuana right now. And a lot of them have gone back. But we stopped them, but it's very tough. And if we didn't have a wall in those areas, it would have been very hard to stop them. We have the military and we have the Border Patrol; they've done an incredible job. And ICE has done an incredible job all over the country, frankly. We've removed thousands of MS-13 and others out of our country. But if we had a wall, we wouldn't have that problem. It would be great. So we have a lot of alternatives, but I'm just honored that almost all of the Republicans voted for our bill. Our bill is the bill that, I think, we're really focused on. But we had almost all of the Republicans, so the end result was 50-47. The Democrats lost one that came over to our side. So they pretty much held, and we held. And, again, we were missing two Republicans. They couldn't vote. They were not here. Q Do you get the sense that there's enough movement to end the shutdown soon? Or are we going to see this drag out for a while? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I have to find out. After this meeting, we'll find out. But right now, Mitch McConnell is meeting with Chuck Schumer and to see , they'll have to see what happens. They're meeting to see if they can work out something, maybe on a temporary basis where we start. But I have , you know, we have a lot of alternatives. There are a lot of people that want this to happen. I'll tell you who wants this to happen: The military wants this to happen because this is a virtual invasion of our country , of drugs, of human traffickers, of so many different things, of criminals. It's an invasion of our country. And the military wants this to happen, and the Border Patrol wants this to happen. And, by the way, Border Patrol said all of the drones flying up in the air , having a lot of fun, flying drones all over the place , they don't mean a thing when they look down and they see thousands of people rushing our border. The only thing that works is a strong barrier or wall. Q Have you talked to Nancy Pelosi? Or do you plan to talk to her soon? THE PRESIDENT: I have not. I haven't spoken to Nancy Pelosi. But I'm here, you know? I haven't left except for a beautiful evening in Iraq. I've been here for a long time. Q Mr. President, did you see Wilbur Ross said that he didn't understand why federal workers would need help getting food? Can you understand why? THE PRESIDENT: No, I haven't , I haven't heard the statement, but I do understand that perhaps he should have said it differently. Local people know who they are when they go for groceries and everything else. And I think what Wilbur was probably trying to say is that they will work along. I know banks are working along. If you have mortgages, the mortgagees , the mortgage , the folks collecting the interest and all of those things, they work along. And that's what happens in times like this. They know the people. They've been dealing with them for years. And they work along. The grocery store , and I think that's probably what Wilbur Ross meant, but I haven't seen his statement, no. But he's done a great job, I will tell you that. Yes. Q On Venezuela, I just want to know: Aren't you worried to leave the American diplomats behind? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we're looking at Venezuela. It's a very sad situation. That was the richest state in all of that area. That's a big, beautiful area, and by far the richest. And now it's one of the poorest places in the world. That's what socialism gets you, when they want to raise your taxes to 70 percent. You know, it's interesting, I've been watching our opponents , our future opponents , talking about 70 percent. Number one, they can't do it for 70 percent. It's got to be probably twice that number. But, maybe more importantly, what happens is you really have to study and take a look at what's happened to Venezuela. It is a very, very sad situation. So we have our eye very closely on Venezuela. Very closely. Q Mr. President, if Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer can come to some sort of agreement, will you support the results of those negotiations? THE PRESIDENT: Well, it depends what the agreement is. I mean, yeah , but if they come to a reasonable agreement, I would support it. Yeah. Q Even if it has no wall money? Or does it have to have wall money?THE PRESIDENT: I only , look, look , I have other alternatives, if I have to. And I'll use those alternatives if I have to. But we want to go through the system. We have to have a wall in this country. We have criminals pouring into our country. And I'm not talking about the southern border. They don't stay there. They go through and they permeate all throughout the country, including places like Wisconsin , a lot of different places. And that's the problem. I say that we would cut our crime , you know, we're very well on crime rate, compared to past years and past administration, but I think our crime rate would go way down. And I know our drug rates , our drug , what's happening is the drugs are pouring in. And, yes, they come through the ports of entry, but the big trucks come through areas where you don't have a wall and you have wide-open spaces. We have to have the wall. You'd stop drugs. You'd stop human trafficking. I mean, human trafficking , where they tie up women and they put duct tape on their mouths, and they put them in the backseat of a car or in a van. They don't come through a port of entry because the people at the port of entry are going to see that. That's not like hiding drugs in the engine or in the hubcaps, and they have incredible, ingenious ideas. I mean, frankly, I have to say, some of these people are so genius, if they were ever legit, they'd become very rich people. But what they do is they go through the ports of entry with small stuff, but the big stuff comes through areas where you have nobody watching. I mean, you have hundreds of miles of open space, and they go out there, and they're loaded up with drugs or they have women in the backseat of the cars with duct tape all over the place. It's a disgrace. And you don't catch them. They make a , you don't even know the difference between Mexico and the United States. They make a left turn after they go out 20 miles, 40 miles , 5 miles, in some cases, and less. They make a left turn; they're in the United States. And then they do whatever they have to do. You need the wall. And we can all play games, and we can all talk about technology. I know more about technology than anybody. If you don't have the wall, the technology doesn't work. First of all, the wall is based on , I mean, it's all based , any technology works only with the wall. It's not going to work otherwise. You need the wall. In fact, a lot of the technology is put on top of the wall. That's how you see it , the cameras and everything else. I mean, they literally put the technology , they fasten it to the wall. Then you have drone technology. And that's great, in terms of , what are you going to do? Are you going to follow the people? First of all, once they step into the country, you know what happens, right? You know what they do. It's called , what do they call it? Do you know? Q Tell me. THE PRESIDENT: They put one foot in our country, right? And we got them. That's it. So the drones don't help us. We have to keep it out. We have , we have no choice but to have a wall or a barrier. And if we don't have that, it's just not going to work. So it's very important to me. All right. One more question. Q Mr. President, what's your message to federal workers who are missing another paycheck this week and struggling? THE PRESIDENT: I love them. I respect them. I really appreciate the great job they're doing. They , you know, many of those people that are not getting paid are totally in favor of what we're doing because they know the future of this country is dependent on having a strong border, especially a strong southern border because we have tremendous violence and crime coming through that border. We have tremendous drugs. We have the human trafficking. We have MS-13 and gangs pouring through those borders. And if we don't strengthen those borders, we're going to have a big problem in the future. And one of the people I blame is myself because the economy is so strong right now , stronger than ever before. Today , today, right now , we have more people working in the United States than has ever worked in this country before. That's a great compliment. So I blame myself, okay? But the fact is people come up because our country is doing so well, and they want to break through our borders. The fact is we want them to come up. We have a big , we took in more people last year, legally, than we have in a long time because we need them because we have , a lot of companies are coming into our country. So we need people coming in. I want people to come in, but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit. They have to be able to help companies. And if they don't help companies and if they don't help our country, we can't do that, folks. We just can't do that. All right? Q Why did you decide to agree to Nancy Pelosi that (inaudible)? THE PRESIDENT: Well, it's really her choice. I mean, I would have done it in a different location, but I think that would be very disrespectful to the State of the Union , to pick some other place. I could have done it. I could have gone to a big auditorium and gotten 25,000 people in one day , and you've been there many times , but I think that would be very disrespectful to the State of the Union. So what she said, I thought, was actually reasonable: We'll have the State of the Union when the shutdown is over. Q And when do you think that's going to be? THE PRESIDENT: That I can't tell you. That I can't tell you. But we have a lot of alternatives. But we need border security. Okay, thank you very much everybody. Thank you.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1318239\/remarks-by-president-trump-in-a-meeting-with-republican-members-of-congress-on-the-united-states-reciprocal-trade-act&speechType=6","Summary":"National Security Government Operations Trade","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-meeting-republican-members-congress-united-states-reciprocal-trade-act\/","CleanText":"Another day in paradise, right? (Laughter.) A good day. A good day. This is the United States Reciprocal Trade Act that this room is very enthused about, that a lot of people are very enthused about. We're taken advantage of by many, many countries all over the world. They charge us tariffs and taxe , the likes of which nobody has any understanding, they're so high and so unfair. They also have barriers where we can't go in. They have trade barriers that make it impossible for us to sell our farm products and our other products or cars in those places. So this is the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, and it's really a preliminary meeting. It's a little bit of an early meeting. We're going to be talking about it. We have tremendous support, and we're going to find out what happens. It should have been done many years ago, as many things should have been done many years ago. Frankly, the wall should have been built many years ago; we wouldn't have the problems that we have today. So I'm pleased to welcome Republican members of Congress to the White House. I especially want to thank Congressman Sean Duffy for sponsoring one of the top legislative priorities, to my way of thinking, that you can have. It's called 'fairness,' really. The United States Reciprocal Trade Act , this legislation will help finally to give our workers a fair and level playing field against other countries. Countries are taking advantage of us, whether they think we're very nice or not so smart. They've been doing it for many, many years, and we want to end it. Many of these are friends. Many of these are allies. But sometimes allies take advantage of us even more so than our non-allies. All over the world, foreign countries put massive tariffs on our products while we put very few, if any, on theirs. So we then wonder why we're not doing the business we should be doing. And we wonder, maybe most importantly, why we had, last year, over an $800 trillion trade deficient , $800 billion, in terms of a trade deficit. So when you have a number like $800 billion, you say to yourself, 'Somebody made a lot of bad deals.' And that's happened over a long period of time. The Reciprocal Trade Act will give us the tools to solve this problem once and for all. In addition to the various trade deals that we're working on with Mexico, Canada, China , South Korea, we just finished. It's a good deal. Made it a good deal. It was a terrible deal, and we made it into a good deal. We'll get the trade way down and we'll get the deficits way down. Under the U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act, whatever the tariffs for a foreign country is, we place the same tariff on us. So if somebody is charging , and I brought a chart. If somebody is charging us 100 percent tariff, and we're charging them nothing, we're entitled to charge the same tariff as them. And what's going to happen, I think, from a practical standpoint, is they won't be charging us tariffs anymore. We'll see. Or we'll charge them a lot. It's a tremendous amount of money. It's a tremendous problem for our country. The U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act will be an incredible tool to bring foreign countries to the negotiating table and to get them to lower their tariffs on our products and also to get rid of their trade barriers, making it really impossible for us to do business. India, as an example, has a 150 percent , hard to believe , tariff on whiskey. They make whiskey, and they sell it to us. We charge them zero. We sell it to them; they charge us 150 percent. So I would say, other than that, it's a very fair deal. Okay? (Laughter.) That's the least of it. We have far worse than that. The EU charges us 67 percent tariff on pork, and we charge them almost nothing. And they make it very hard for us to sell pork in the EU. For bulldozers, Malaysia charges us, as an example, 20 percent, and Indonesia charges us a lot. We charge them all nothing. We charge them nothing. Very unfair to our companies. Very unfair to our workers. So if countries refuse to lower their barriers, then we will simply place a matching tariff on their product. It's very simple. It's the simplest thing that you can do. The result will be more countries will remove their barriers and open their markets to American exports, to American farmers, to American manufacturers. I will be talking a lot about reciprocal trade over the next six years. Hopefully, we'll have it done in two years or less. And we will see deficits down to a level that would really , you know, we talk about 'Make America Great Again'; we have to do these things to make America great again. Because we can't lose almost $800 billion on trade, like has been done for many years. And it's been numbers , they varied anywhere from $300 billion to over $800 billion. Can't do that. And what we're doing with China, I think, will have a tremendous impact, if you look at the numbers that we're talking about. We'll see how that all comes out. But, as you know, we're charging tremendous tariffs now, and they go up, as of March 1st, very substantially. I think China would like to make a deal. We'd like to make a deal. I like exactly where we are right now, to be honest with you. We're very happy. We have billions of dollars coming into our Treasury , billions , from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our Treasury; now we have billions coming in. But if we could make a deal that'll be great , on intellectual property, and theft, and all of the other things we're talking about, in addition to taxes themselves. So I'll be talking a lot about this over the next period of time, and I want to just thank the incredible people , all friends of mine. They are , this is a very early meeting. This is the beginning of something, I think, that's going to be very important for our country. And I look forward to discussing it. They did a chart, right here, where, as an example, these are , and these are not big abuses. You look at apples. Japan, foreign tariff , 17 percent. The United States , nothing. We get nothing; they get 17. The same apple. Actually, ours are better, you want to know the truth. (Laughter.) So that makes it even worse. I don't want to cover you up. You're such a good-looking guy, He's a handsome man. I don't want to cover him up. Autos, China , you have a 15 percent tariff, and the U.S. has 2.5. So when you sell , and, by the way, we got the autos down from 40 in China. I got them down to 15. But it's still 15 percent versus 2.5 percent. But, if you know, it was 40 and 25 percent. We got them down to 15, but that's really not good enough because we have 15 versus 2.5 percent. And we don't even get the 2.5 percent. There are ways that they can eliminate that. French fries , one of our favorite meals. (Laughter.) French fries from Thailand , 30 percent. We get 8 percent. You look at the numbers. Go down , look at motorcycles, as an example. India , 50 percent. It was 100 percent. I got them down to 50 percent just by talking for about two minutes. But it's still 50 percent versus 2.4 percent. Again, other than that, it's a very fair deal. Pork, EU , pretty much zero. And it's 67 percent. So you look at that, and something like whiskey from India, and other things from India , India is a very high tariff. They charge us a lot of tariffs. But you look at whiskey. So India gets 150 percent, and we get nothing. I will tell you that those are just a few of the products. It's actually much worse than that, as bad as that sounds. And all we're saying , if you're going to charge us 150 percent, we're going to charge you 150 percent. And what will happen, in many cases, is we'll both charge each other nothing or we'll get 150 percent. That's okay, too. I spoke to a couple senators about this that are really into this stuff, and they said, 'Hey, sounds fair to me.' And a lot of people think it's fair. We have to get foreign countries to respect us again, both militarily and on trade. And I tell you, we have come a long way in two years. It's a whole different ballgame. When you look at what's happened, it's a whole different ballgame. So this is the Reciprocal Trade Act, and I think that it's something that's going to , you're going to hear a lot about it. And, you know, hard to believe , you'll have people that are against it. You'll have people say that we don't mind if a country charges us 50 percent, 100 percent, 250 percent. We have some cases, like with butter , Sean was telling me , in Wisconsin. Do you want to tell that story? The difference? Mister great hockey player, congratulations on your victory. We worked hard, right? That was a great job. Great job. Thank you. (Inaudible.) Thank you very much. Congratulations. So thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you."}

My fellow Americans, I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and re-open the federal government. (Applause.) As everyone knows, I have a very powerful alternative, but I didn't want to use it at this time. Hopefully it will be unnecessary. I want to thank all of the incredible federal workers, and their amazing families, who have shown such extraordinary devotion in the face of this recent hardship. You are fantastic people. You are incredible patriots. Many of you have suffered far greater than anyone, but your families would know or understand. And not only did you not complain, but in many cases you encouraged me to keep going because you care so much about our country and about its border security. Again, I thank you. All Americans, I thank you. You are very, very special people. I am so proud that you are citizens of our country. When I say \"Make America Great Again,\" it could never be done without you. Great people. In a short while, I will sign a bill to open our government for three weeks until February 15th. I will make sure that all employees receive their back pay very quickly, or as soon as possible. It'll happen fast. I am asking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to put this proposal on the floor immediately. After 36 days of spirited debate and dialogue, I have seen and heard from enough Democrats and Republicans that they are willing to put partisanship aside , I think , and put the security of the American people first. I do believe they're going to do that. They have said they are for complete border security, and they have finally and fully acknowledged that having barriers, fencing, or walls , or whatever you want to call it , will be an important part of the solution. A bipartisan Conference Committee of House and Senate lawmakers and leaders will immediately begin reviewing the requests of our Homeland Security experts , and experts they are , and also law enforcement professionals, who have worked with us so closely. We want to thank Border Patrol, ICE, and all law enforcement. Been incredible. (Applause.) Based on operational guidance from the experts in the field, they will put together a Homeland Security package for me to shortly sign into law. Over the next 21 days, I expect that both Democrats and Republicans will operate in good faith. This is an opportunity for all parties to work together for the benefit of our whole beautiful, wonderful nation. If we make a fair deal, the American people will be proud of their government for proving that we can put country before party. We can show all Americans, and people all around the world, that both political parties are united when it comes to protecting our country and protecting our people. Many disagree, but I really feel that, working with Democrats and Republicans, we can make a truly great and secure deal happen for everyone. Walls should not be controversial. Our country has built 654 miles of barrier over the last 15 years, and every career Border Patrol agent I have spoken with has told me that walls work. They do work. No matter where you go, they work. Israel built a wall , 99.9 percent successful. Won't be any different for us. They keep criminals out. They save good people from attempting a very dangerous journey from other countries , thousands of miles , because they think they have a glimmer of hope of coming through. With a wall, they don't have that hope. They keep drugs out, and they dramatically increase efficiency by allowing us to patrol far larger areas with far fewer people. It's just common sense. Walls work. That's why most of the Democrats in Congress have voted in the past for bills that include walls and physical barriers and very powerful fences. The walls we are building are not medieval walls. They are smart walls designed to meet the needs of frontline border agents, and are operationally effective. These barriers are made of steel, have see-through visibility, which is very important, and are equipped with sensors, monitors, and cutting-edge technology, including state-of-the-art drones. We do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea , we never did; we never proposed that; we never wanted that , because we have barriers at the border where natural structures are as good as anything that we can build. They're already there. They've been there for millions of years. Our proposed structures will be in pre-determined high-risk locations that have been specifically identified by the Border Patrol to stop illicit flows of people and drugs. No border security plan can ever work without a physical barrier. Just doesn't happen. At the same time, we need to increase drug detection technology and manpower to modernize our ports of entry, which are obsolete. The equipment is obsolete. They're old. They're tired. This is something we have all come to agree on, and will allow for quicker and safer commerce. These critical investments will improve and facilitate legal trade and travel through our lawful ports of entry. Our plan also includes desperately needed humanitarian assistance for those being exploited and abused by coyotes, smugglers, and the dangerous journey north. The requests we have put before Congress are vital to ending the humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border. Absolutely vital. Will not work without it. This crisis threatens the safety of our country and thousands of American lives. Criminal cartels, narco-terrorists, transnational gangs like MS-13, and human traffickers are brazenly violating U.S. laws and terrorizing innocent communities. Human traffickers , the victims are women and children. Maybe to a lesser extent, believe or not, children. Women are tied up. They're bound. Duct tape put around their faces, around their mouths. In many cases, they can't even breathe. They're put in the backs of cars or vans or trucks. They don't go through your port of entry. They make a right turn going very quickly. They go into the desert areas, or whatever areas you can look at. And as soon as there's no protection, they make a left or a right into the United States of America. There's nobody to catch them. There's nobody to find them. They can't come through the port, because if they come through the port, people will see four women sitting in a van with tape around their face and around their mouth. Can't have that. And that problem, because of the Internet, is the biggest problem , it's never been like this before , that you can imagine. It's at the worst level , human trafficking , in the history of the world. This is not a United States problem; this is a world problem. But they come through areas where they have no protection, where they have no steel barriers, where they have no walls. And we can stop almost 100 percent of that. The profits reaped by these murderous organizations are used to fund their malign and destabilizing conduct throughout this hemisphere. Last year alone, ICE officers removed 10,000 known or suspected gang members, like MS-13 and members as bad as them. Horrible people. Tough. Mean. Sadistic. In the last two years, ICE officers arrested a total of 266,000 criminal aliens inside of the United States, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 homicides or, as you would call them, violent, vicious killings. It can be stopped. Vast quantities of lethal drugs , including meth, fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine , are smuggled across our southern border and into U.S. schools and communities. Drugs kill much more than 70,000 Americans a year and cost our society in excess of $700 billion. The sheer volume of illegal immigration has overwhelmed federal authorities and stretched our immigration system beyond the breaking point. Nearly 50 migrants a day are being referred for medical assistance , they are very, very sick , making this a health crisis as well. It's a very big health crisis. People have no idea how big it is, unless you're there. Our backlog in the immigration courts is now far greater than the 800,000 cases that you've been hearing about over the last couple of years. Think of that, though: 800,000 cases because our laws are obsolete. So obsolete. They're the laughing stock all over the world. Our immigration laws, all over the world , they've been there for a long time , are the laughing stock, all over the world. We do not have the necessary space or resources to detain, house, vet, screen, and safely process this tremendous influx of people. In short, we do not have control over who is entering our country, where they come from, who they are, or why they are coming. The result, for many years, is a colossal danger to public safety. We're going to straighten it out. It's not hard. It's easy, if given the resources. Last month was the third straight month in a row with 60,000 apprehensions on our southern border. Think of that. we apprehended 60,000 people. That's like a stadium full of people. A big stadium. There are many criminals being apprehended, but vast numbers are coming because our economy is so strong. We have the strongest economy now in the entire world. You see what's happening. We have nowhere left to house them and no way to promptly remove them. We can't get them out because our laws are so obsolete, so antiquated, and so bad. Without new resources from Congress, we will be forced to release these people into communities , something we don't want to do , called catch-and-release. You catch them. Even if they are criminals, you then release them. And you can't release them from where they came, so they go into our country and end up in places you would least suspect. And we do as little releasing as possible, by they're coming by the hundreds of thousands. I have had zero Democrat lawmakers volunteer to have them released into their districts or states. And I think they know that, and that's what we're going to be discussing over the next three weeks. The painful reality is that the tremendous economic and financial burdens of illegal immigration fall on the shoulders of low-income Americans, including millions of wonderful, patriotic, law-abiding immigrants who enrich our nation. As Commander-in-Chief, my highest priority is the defense of our great country. We cannot surrender operational control over the nation's borders to foreign cartels, traffickers, and smugglers. We want future Americans to come to our country legally and through a system based on merit. We need people to come to our country. We have great companies moving back into the United States. And we have the lowest employment and the best employment numbers that we've ever had. There are more people working today in the United States than have ever worked in our country. We need people to come in to help us , the farms, and with all of these great companies that are moving back. Finally, they're moving back. People said it couldn't happen. It's happening. And we want them to enjoy the blessings of safety and liberty, and the rule of law. We cannot protect and deliver these blessings without a strong and secure border. I believe that crime in this country can go down by a massive percentage if we have great security on our southern border. I believe drugs, large percentages of which come through the southern border, will be cut by a number that nobody will believe. So let me be very clear: We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier. If we don't get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on February 15th, again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States to address this emergency. We will have great security. And I want to thank you all very much. Thank you very much.

Over the next 21 days, I expect that both Democrats and Republicans will operate in good faith. This is an opportunity for all parties to work together for the benefit of our whole beautiful, wonderful nation. If we make a fair deal, the American people will be proud of their government for proving that we can put country before party. We can show all Americans, and people all around the world, that both political parties are united when it comes to protecting our country and protecting our people. Many disagree, but I really feel that, working with Democrats and Republicans, we can make a truly great and secure deal happen for everyone. Walls should not be controversial. Our country has built 654 miles of barrier over the last 15 years, and every career Border Patrol agent I have spoken with has told me that walls work. They do work. No matter where you go, they work. Israel built a wall , 99.9 percent successful. Won't be any different for us. They keep criminals out. They save good people from attempting a very dangerous journey from other countries , thousands of miles , because they think they have a glimmer of hope of coming through. With a wall, they don't have that hope. They keep drugs out, and they dramatically increase efficiency by allowing us to patrol far larger areas with far fewer people. It's just common sense. Walls work. That's why most of the Democrats in Congress have voted in the past for bills that include walls and physical barriers and very powerful fences. The walls we are building are not medieval walls. They are smart walls designed to meet the needs of frontline border agents, and are operationally effective. These barriers are made of steel, have see-through visibility, which is very important, and are equipped with sensors, monitors, and cutting-edge technology, including state-of-the-art drones. We do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea , we never did; we never proposed that; we never wanted that , because we have barriers at the border where natural structures are as good as anything that we can build. They're already there. They've been there for millions of years. Our proposed structures will be in pre-determined high-risk locations that have been specifically identified by the Border Patrol to stop illicit flows of people and drugs. No border security plan can ever work without a physical barrier. Just doesn't happen. At the same time, we need to increase drug detection technology and manpower to modernize our ports of entry, which are obsolete. The equipment is obsolete. They're old. They're tired. This is something we have all come to agree on, and will allow for quicker and safer commerce. These critical investments will improve and facilitate legal trade and travel through our lawful ports of entry. Our plan also includes desperately needed humanitarian assistance for those being exploited and abused by coyotes, smugglers, and the dangerous journey north. The requests we have put before Congress are vital to ending the humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border. Absolutely vital. Will not work without it. This crisis threatens the safety of our country and thousands of American lives. Criminal cartels, narco-terrorists, transnational gangs like MS-13, and human traffickers are brazenly violating U.S. laws and terrorizing innocent communities. Human traffickers , the victims are women and children. Maybe to a lesser extent, believe or not, children. Women are tied up. They're bound. Duct tape put around their faces, around their mouths. In many cases, they can't even breathe. They're put in the backs of cars or vans or trucks. They don't go through your port of entry. They make a right turn going very quickly. They go into the desert areas, or whatever areas you can look at. And as soon as there's no protection, they make a left or a right into the United States of America. There's nobody to catch them. There's nobody to find them. They can't come through the port, because if they come through the port, people will see four women sitting in a van with tape around their face and around their mouth. Can't have that. And that problem, because of the Internet, is the biggest problem , it's never been like this before , that you can imagine. It's at the worst level , human trafficking , in the history of the world. This is not a United States problem; this is a world problem. But they come through areas where they have no protection, where they have no steel barriers, where they have no walls. And we can stop almost 100 percent of that. The profits reaped by these murderous organizations are used to fund their malign and destabilizing conduct throughout this hemisphere. Last year alone, ICE officers removed 10,000 known or suspected gang members, like MS-13 and members as bad as them. Horrible people. Tough. Mean. Sadistic. In the last two years, ICE officers arrested a total of 266,000 criminal aliens inside of the United States, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 homicides or, as you would call them, violent, vicious killings. It can be stopped. Vast quantities of lethal drugs , including meth, fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine , are smuggled across our southern border and into U.S. schools and communities. Drugs kill much more than 70,000 Americans a year and cost our society in excess of $700 billion. The sheer volume of illegal immigration has overwhelmed federal authorities and stretched our immigration system beyond the breaking point. Nearly 50 migrants a day are being referred for medical assistance , they are very, very sick , making this a health crisis as well. It's a very big health crisis. People have no idea how big it is, unless you're there. Our backlog in the immigration courts is now far greater than the 800,000 cases that you've been hearing about over the last couple of years. Think of that, though: 800,000 cases because our laws are obsolete. So obsolete. They're the laughing stock all over the world. Our immigration laws, all over the world , they've been there for a long time , are the laughing stock, all over the world. We do not have the necessary space or resources to detain, house, vet, screen, and safely process this tremendous influx of people. In short, we do not have control over who is entering our country, where they come from, who they are, or why they are coming. The result, for many years, is a colossal danger to public safety. We're going to straighten it out. It's not hard. It's easy, if given the resources. Last month was the third straight month in a row with 60,000 apprehensions on our southern border. Think of that. we apprehended 60,000 people. That's like a stadium full of people. A big stadium. There are many criminals being apprehended, but vast numbers are coming because our economy is so strong. We have the strongest economy now in the entire world. You see what's happening. We have nowhere left to house them and no way to promptly remove them. We can't get them out because our laws are so obsolete, so antiquated, and so bad. Without new resources from Congress, we will be forced to release these people into communities , something we don't want to do , called catch-and-release. You catch them. Even if they are criminals, you then release them. And you can't release them from where they came, so they go into our country and end up in places you would least suspect. And we do as little releasing as possible, by they're coming by the hundreds of thousands. I have had zero Democrat lawmakers volunteer to have them released into their districts or states. And I think they know that, and that's what we're going to be discussing over the next three weeks. The painful reality is that the tremendous economic and financial burdens of illegal immigration fall on the shoulders of low-income Americans, including millions of wonderful, patriotic, law-abiding immigrants who enrich our nation. As Commander-in-Chief, my highest priority is the defense of our great country. We cannot surrender operational control over the nation's borders to foreign cartels, traffickers, and smugglers. We want future Americans to come to our country legally and through a system based on merit. We need people to come to our country. We have great companies moving back into the United States. And we have the lowest employment and the best employment numbers that we've ever had. There are more people working today in the United States than have ever worked in our country. We need people to come in to help us , the farms, and with all of these great companies that are moving back. Finally, they're moving back. People said it couldn't happen. It's happening. And we want them to enjoy the blessings of safety and liberty, and the rule of law. We cannot protect and deliver these blessings without a strong and secure border. I believe that crime in this country can go down by a massive percentage if we have great security on our southern border. I believe drugs, large percentages of which come through the southern border, will be cut by a number that nobody will believe. So let me be very clear: We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier. If we don't get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on February 15th, again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States to address this emergency. We will have great security. And I want to thank you all very much. Thank you very much. (Applause.)"}

{"SpeechID":"VSDT522019532","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2019-02-05","SpeechTitle":"President Donald J. Trump's State of the Union Address","Type":"speech","RawText":"Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation. The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people. Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first. There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country. This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission, and the power of American pride. In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade , the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you. In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution , and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness. Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades. In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom , a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs , something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started. Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history , 157 million. We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty , and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try. My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations. We have unleashed a revolution in American energy , the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before. On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone , almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States , and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way! We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate , some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country. Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans. And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population , and far beyond. Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing , and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life. In June, I commuted Alice's sentence , and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. When I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing. Inspired by stories like Alice's, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption. We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home. As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis. The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border. Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business. As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught. This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well\u2011being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration , reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate , it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery. Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities , including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families , no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured. Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great\u2011granddaughter, Madison. To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border. In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings. We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: \"If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job.\" Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year. Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement , and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE. My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall , but the proper wall never got built. I'll get it built. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier , not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime , one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe. As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before , and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before. As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount , reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods , and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us , I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs. Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried , until now. Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement , or USMCA , will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA. Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us. Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure. I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill , and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity. The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs , and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Already, as a result of my Administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years. But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it. I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down. No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America. Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer. Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: \"Last Day of Chemo.\" Grace , you are an inspiration to us all. Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research. To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave , so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children , born and unborn , are made in the holy image of God. The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security. Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military , with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO , but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies. As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System. Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests. For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't , in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far. As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam. Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido. We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom , and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair. Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence , not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled realism , not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel , and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East. As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home. I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor , and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement , but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole , and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack. We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country. We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery , but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil. Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall , more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: \"It's the Americans.\" A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. \"To me,\" Joshua recalls, \"the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.\" I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight , seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation. When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America , they did it for us. Everything that has come since , our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice , all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before. Think of this Capitol , think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire. Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences , or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance , or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown. This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future , our fate , and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's destiny , that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world! Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1320087\/president-donald-j-trumps-state-of-the-union-address&speechType=1","Summary":"National Security Women Minors and Children Oil and Gas Defense Employment and Affirmative Action Religion Foreign Affairs Government Operations Trade Infrastructure Health and Health Care Arts, Entertainment, and History Drugs Energy Immigration Reproduction Criminal Justice","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/president-donald-j-trumps-state-union-address-2\/","CleanText":"Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation. The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people. Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first. There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country. This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission, and the power of American pride. In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade , the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you. In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution , and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness. Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades. In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom , a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs , something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started. Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history , 157 million. We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty , and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try. My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations. We have unleashed a revolution in American energy , the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before. On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone , almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States , and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way! We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate , some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country. Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans. And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population , and far beyond. Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing , and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life. In June, I commuted Alice's sentence , and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. When I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing. Inspired by stories like Alice's, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption. We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home. As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis. The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border. Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business. As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught. This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well-being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration , reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate , it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery. Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities , including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families , no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured. Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter, Madison. To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border. In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings. We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: 'If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job.' Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year. Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement , and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE. My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall , but the proper wall never got built. I'll get it built. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier , not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime , one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe. As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before , and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before. As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount , reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods , and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us , I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs. Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried , until now. Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement , or USMCA , will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA. Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us. Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure. I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill , and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity. The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs , and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Already, as a result of my Administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years. But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it. I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down. No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America. Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer. Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: 'Last Day of Chemo.' Grace , you are an inspiration to us all. Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research. To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave , so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children , born and unborn , are made in the holy image of God. The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security. Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military , with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO , but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies. As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System. Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests. For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't , in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far. As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam. Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido. We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom , and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair. Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence , not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled realism , not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel , and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East. As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home. I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor , and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement , but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole , and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack. We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country. We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery , but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil. Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall , more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: 'It's the Americans.' A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. 'To me,' Joshua recalls, 'the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.' I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight , seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation. When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America , they did it for us. Everything that has come since , our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice , all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before. Think of this Capitol , think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire. Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences , or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance , or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown. This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future , our fate , and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's destiny , that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world! Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!"}

And you are doing a spectacular job. I say that on behalf of many people. It's an honor to be here today at the State Department among so many distinguished diplomats and others representing the nations of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. Together, we comprise 74 countries and 5 international institutions, all united in the fight against this vile terrorist organization. And vile they are. I want to thank Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. Patrick, stand up. You've been doing a fantastic job. We appreciate it. (Applause.) Thank you. Ambassador James Jeffrey, thank you. Thank you. And all of our Coalition members here today for their enduring commitment to defeating ISIS in the Middle East and around the world. In January 2017, only two years ago, ISIS had a vast amount of territory in Syria and Iraq. When I became President, I said, \"I want to see what they have.\" And I looked, and it was a mess. It was a lot. When I took office, one of my very first acts was to go to the Pentagon and ask them to produce and show me a plan to defeat ISIS. Under the new approach we developed, we empowered our commanders in the field, enabled our partners on the ground, and directly confronted ISIS's wicked ideology. And we're doing that today, except in even greater numbers.As a result, as I noted in my State of the Union Address yesterday, the United States military, our Coalition partners, and the Syrian Democratic Forces have liberated virtually all of the territory previously held by ISIS in Syria and Iraq. It should be formally announced sometime probably next week that we will have 100 percent of the caliphate. But I want to wait for the official word. I don't want to say it too early. Over the past two years, we have retaken more than 20,000 square miles of land. We have secured one battlefield. And we've had victory after victory after victory, and retaken both Mosul and Raqqa. We have eliminated more than 60 mile high-value ISIS leaders. So we have a , if you look at the ISIS leaders of the 60 top, we've eliminated almost every one of them. Now, they re-form; we know that. But they're having a hard time re-forming, and I wouldn't say it's a great job to have because of us. It's not exactly , hopefully will not be a sought-after occupation. More than a hundred other top ISIS officials have been eliminated, and tens of thousands of ISIS fighters are gone. They're gone. Together, we have freed more than 5 million civilians from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. And you know the killers they are. You see it. And we used to see it to an extent we couldn't believe, where our people and our friends and our allies , in many cases, people whose parents I've gotten to know , had to wear the orange uniform prior to you know what. We don't want to see those scenes anymore. Thanks to the Global Coalition, including all of you here today, and to our other partners, the ISIS caliphate has been decimated. Nobody thought it was possible to do it this quickly. Three weeks ago, I was in Iraq and I was talking to some of our great generals, and I gave them the absolute go-ahead. I said, \"Go at it. How long will it take once you get started?\" He said, \"Sir, one week.\" I said, \"Where did that come from , one week?\" And he meant it. And it's about a week since they really got going. And they'll be informing us very soon, officially. But it's 100 percent.ISIS can no longer claim widespread ownership over local governments in Syria and Iraq. Now, you're always going to have people; they'll be around. They're sick. They're demented. But you're going to have them no matter how well we do militarily. You can't do better than we've done, militarily. But you will have people that will be around. And we'll search them out, and you'll search them out, and we'll find them. And hopefully, they won't be around very long.They can no longer extract natural resources because they no longer control the land or the area. They can no longer tax the citizens in that area because they no longer have that area, or steal ancient artifacts or destroy ancient artifacts, as they've been doing. They've really been set back. We're working very hard on the Internet. For a period of time, they used the Internet better than we did. They used the Internet brilliantly, but now it's not so brilliant. And now the people on the Internet that used to look up to them and say how wonderful and brilliant they are, are not thinking of them as being so brilliant. Because they've been decimated. They can no longer control schools to impose their vicious ideology on young children. Critically, ISIS also now lacks a significant territorial base from which to launch terrorist attacks against other countries, recruit foreign fighters, and spread havoc across the region. Their land is gone. It's a big factor. Their land is gone.This afternoon, I want to applaud the outstanding men and women of the United States military , incredible people , for their remarkable skill and precision throughout this entire campaign. Now, as countries in the region and across our Coalition step up their commitments, and we continue to destroy the remnants , that's all they have, remnants. But remnants can be very dangerous; you have to remember that. A remnant can be very dangerous. But we have remnants of ISIS. We look forward to giving our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome back home.Rest assured, we will do what it takes to defeat every ounce and every last person within the ISIS madness, and defend our people from radical Islamic terrorism. I commend the 30 other nations who are already contributing troops to this vital effort. And it's a different effort than we had initially, but totally vital.In recent months, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia have all made financial commitments. The struggle against terrorism is a shared fight. We do it together. If we don't do it together, it can never be the same. Everyone must do their part and contribute their fair share. We must also recognize that immigration security is national security, and that foreign fighters must not gain access into our nations. We've been extremely tough on people that we think can be in any way working with , or even be a part of , radical Islamic terror. I've been very, very tough on that, and I hope every other nation is, too.I just want to thank everybody in this room. This is a special group of brilliant people, and it's been an honor to work with you. And we will continue to work with you, because unfortunately this is not going to be something that , as brilliant as our military is, knocking out the big, big sections, they'll have tiny sections. It can be so dangerous. But I want to just thank everybody. Having the Coalition, having the partnership , because it's really a partnership , with you has been my honor. Our military has been incredible. And your militaries have been incredible. So it's an honor to work with you. We will be working with you for many years to come. I say that unfortunately, but that's the way it goes. We will work together for many years to come. It'll get smaller, smaller, and smaller. And someday, maybe, we won't have to even think about this problem that is so prevalent today. Thank you all very much. It's a great honor to be here. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)

I can say that. Never. (Applause.) Thank you. I am honored to be here with leaders from across the country and all around the world who are all united by a shared belief in the glory of God and the power of prayer. I want to thank Senator Coons and Senator Lankford for the introduction and for carrying on this wonderful and uplifting bipartisan tradition. Thank you both very much. Thank you, Senators. Senators, thank you very much. (Applause.) We're thrilled to be joined by our tremendous Vice President Mike Pence, along with our incredible Second Lady Karen Pence. And, by the way , (applause) , by the way, I've gotten to know Karen so well. She is a Marine Corps mom, a tremendous woman, a proud supporter of military families, and she just recently went back to teaching art classes at a Christian school. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Karen. Terrific woman. We're also thankful to be joined by the countless faith leaders, foreign dignitaries, and members of Congress, along with many members of my cabinet, including Secretary Mike Pompeo, Sonny Perdue, Alex Acosta, Alex Azar, Ben Carson, Betsy DeVos, and Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. Thank you all for being here. Thank you very much. (Applause.) And thanks also to Gary Haugen for those very powerful words and for rescuing people around the world from the bondage of human trafficking. You are truly doing the Lord's work, and, as you know, our administration is doing everything we can to make your work easier. We're working very closely together. Thank you very much. Thank you, Gary. (Applause.) On Tuesday, it was my profound honor to address the nation from the House Chamber of the State of the Union. And our union, as you heard me say, is very, very strong. (Applause.) As I said in my address, there is no limit to what we can achieve if we follow the path of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. America's potential is unlimited because our extraordinary people are just something that is number one, no matter where you go. We have people , they love our country and they love their faith. We are graced by those extraordinary heroes from Tuesday night: The SWAT Officer Timothy Matson, who raced and raced through a very, very bullet-filled doorway. He was shot many, many times. He has been operated on many times, and, unfortunately, he is going back for more. But he was really stopped from having something as bad as it was. The Tree of Life synagogue was a horrible, horrible event, and he really did do a job. He made it so much better. It was so good to see him. I saw him in the hospital, and he was suffering, and he's still suffering. But he told me the other night he is so proud to have been a part. He was just a great, great gentleman. We introduced him the other night. The wonderful, young girl Grace, who overcame brain cancer , had no idea this was going to happen to her , and bravely rallied an entire community. And the intrepid soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy in the Allied liberation of Europe. On D-Day, all those warriors set out on their mission of liberation; President Franklin Delano Roosevelt led our nation in prayer. In a national radio address, President Roosevelt began with these solemn words: \"Almighty God: Our sons, the pride of our Nation, on this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization.\" Since the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides , from gaining our independence, to abolition, of [to] civil rights, to extending the vote for women , have been led by people of faith and started in prayer. When we open our hearts to faith, we fill our hearts with love. Many of the people in this room lead and support the charities and faith-based institutions that bring hope to the lives of our citizens, comfort to those in despair, and solace to those in grief, aid to those in need, and a helping hand to the struggling people all around the world, of which there are so many. With us today are leaders involved with Prison Fellowship, started by the late Chuck Colson , a man transformed by leaders of this breakfast. Today, Prison Fellowship ministers to more than 300,000 prisoners across America to help others like Alice Johnson and Matthew Charles, who we saw Tuesday night, transform their lives through the mercy and grace of God. And faith leaders helped us achieve historic bipartisan criminal justice reform. (Applause.) They've been wanting to do that for many, many years, and we all together got it done. We just passed the FIRST STEP Act into law. So thank you very much, everybody in the room, for that help. That was a very big thing for our country. (Applause.) America is a nation that believes in redemption. Every day, the people in this room demonstrate the power of faith to transform lives, heal communities, and lift up the forgotten.Some of those in this room are among the Muslim and Christian faith leaders from Minnesota who partnered to send millions of meals to Somalia last year. Also with us today are Catholics, Evangelicals, and members of the Jewish faith who help build homes for our fellow citizens through Habitat for Humanity. As President, I will always cherish, honor, and protect the believers who uplift our communities and sustain our nation.To ensure that people of faith can always contribute to our society, my administration has taken historic action to protect religious liberty. (Applause.) Here with us this morning are Melissa and Chad Buck from Holt, Michigan. In 2009, they decided to adopt. Soon, they got a call about three young siblings in a terribly abusive home. Melissa and Chad had only a few minutes to decide, and they said yes to all three. Today, the Bucks have five beautiful adopted children. As Melissa has said, \"They are the sweetest, most lovable children. They have the most unique gifts.\" Two of them have joined us for this breakfast: 10-year-old Max and 9-year-old Liz. To Max, Liz, and the entire Buck family, thank you for inspiring us all. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Unfortunately, the Michigan adoption charity that brought the Buck family together is now defending itself in court for living by the values of its Catholic faith. We will always protect our country's long and proud tradition of faith-based adoption. (Applause.) My administration is working to ensure that faith-based adoption agencies are able to help vulnerable children find their forever families, while following their deeply held beliefs. (Applause.) My administration is also speaking out against religious persecution around the world, including against religious minorities, Christians, and the Jewish community. (Applause.) This week, I appointed a new Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, and with us , thank you very much , Elon Carr. Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.) A very effective person. The courageous Holocaust survivors in the gallery on Tuesday night powerfully remind us, and remind us all, of our solemn pledge: Never again. (Applause.) My administration is also continuing to fight for American hostages who have been imprisoned overseas for their religious beliefs. Last October, we reached an agreement with Turkey to release Pastor Andrew Brunson, who is now free and joins us here this morning. Where is Andrew? (Applause.) He was there for a long time before I got there, and I said, \"You've got to let him out.\" (Laughter.) \"You better let him out.\" And they let you out. (Laughter.) It was a miracle. (Applause.) Right? We spent a lot of time together. Terrific man. Terrific family. Thank you very much, Andrew. This Saturday, Pastor Brunson will walk his daughter down the aisle. Wow, that's great. Congratulations. Was I invited? I don't know. Was I invited? (Laughter.) He said, \"Yes.\" Thank you. (Laughter.) To protect the dignity and worth of every person, my administration has taken historic action to combat human trafficking. Last year, I directed the State Department to cut off development aid to nations that do not demonstrate a commitment to ending human trafficking in their own countries. (Applause.) And we are fighting every day to stop the tragedy of human trafficking all along our southern border. Together, we will end the scourge of modern-day slavery that, because of the Internet, is at levels that nobody can believe. The Internet came along, and some good things happened. But some very bad things happened, and this is one of them. As part of our commitment to building a just and loving society, we must build a culture that cherishes the dignity and sanctity of innocent human life. (Applause.) All children, born and unborn, are made in the holy image of God. (Applause.) Thank you. Every life is sacred, and every soul is a precious gift from Heaven. As the Lord says in Jeremiah, \"Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you Before you were born, I set you apart.\" Here with us today are Nikki and Tyler Watkinson. Our wonderful First Lady Melania, who is right now working very hard with a group of people and saying a few words on opioids , she's very much involved; she wanted to be here so badly, but she'll be here with us next year , recently met with them and, when she visited them at Children's Hospital, was so impressed. Last year, Nikki went into early labor during a blizzard. As she and Tyler were driving to the hospital, their son Grayson was born in the front seat. He was born four months premature, and weighed only 1 pound and 11 ounces. But he let out little, tiny cries, and he made it to the hospital alive. Nikki and Taylor's [Tyler's] entire community began to lift up Grayson in their prayers, and, to the surprise of doctors, he kept on improving, improving, improving. After four months in the hospital, Nikki and Tyler brought home their beautiful baby boy. Just a few weeks ago, Grayson celebrated his first birthday. He is a beautiful, happy, healthy guy. (Applause.) Are they here? Where? Oh, good. (Applause.) Good. That's great. Beautiful. That's great. Thank you. As his mom, Nikki, has said, \"He was put on this Earth to do big things.\" He may be here someday , right here. Nikki, he already has and he will do more and more as he grows older. As Jesus promises in the Bible, \"Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.\" We are blessed to live in a land of faith where all things are possible. Our only limits are those we place on ourselves. So true. On Tuesday, I asked Americans to choose greatness. And everybody in that room stood and applauded. We asked for greatness , it's greatness for our country , and to renew our love and loyalty to one another , as friends, as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots, and as Americans. There could be no better way to begin this exciting national adventure than the way America has always begun our greatest adventures: by coming together in prayer. So today, and every day, let us pray for the future of our country. Let us pray for the courage to pursue justice and the wisdom to forge peace. Let us pray for a future where every child has a warm, safe, and loving home. Let us come together for the good of our people, for the strength of our families, for the safety of our citizens, for the fulfillment of our deepest hopes and our highest potential. And let us always give thanks for the miracle of life, the majesty of creation, and the grace of Almighty God. Thank you. It is an honor to be with you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)

I can say that. Never. (Applause.) Thank you. I am honored to be here with leaders from across the country and all around the world who are all united by a shared belief in the glory of God and the power of prayer. I want to thank Senator Coons and Senator Lankford for the introduction and for carrying on this wonderful and uplifting bipartisan tradition. Thank you both very much. Thank you, Senators. Senators, thank you very much. (Applause.) We're thrilled to be joined by our tremendous Vice President Mike Pence, along with our incredible Second Lady Karen Pence. And, by the way , (applause) , by the way, I've gotten to know Karen so well. She is a Marine Corps mom, a tremendous woman, a proud supporter of military families, and she just recently went back to teaching art classes at a Christian school. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Karen. Terrific woman. We're also thankful to be joined by the countless faith leaders, foreign dignitaries, and members of Congress, along with many members of my cabinet, including Secretary Mike Pompeo, Sonny Perdue, Alex Acosta, Alex Azar, Ben Carson, Betsy DeVos, and Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. Thank you all for being here. Thank you very much. (Applause.) And thanks also to Gary Haugen for those very powerful words and for rescuing people around the world from the bondage of human trafficking. You are truly doing the Lord's work, and, as you know, our administration is doing everything we can to make your work easier. We're working very closely together. Thank you very much. Thank you, Gary. (Applause.) On Tuesday, it was my profound honor to address the nation from the House Chamber of the State of the Union. And our union, as you heard me say, is very, very strong. (Applause.) As I said in my address, there is no limit to what we can achieve if we follow the path of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. America's potential is unlimited because our extraordinary people are just something that is number one, no matter where you go. We have people , they love our country and they love their faith. We are graced by those extraordinary heroes from Tuesday night: The SWAT Officer Timothy Matson, who raced and raced through a very, very bullet-filled doorway. He was shot many, many times. He has been operated on many times, and, unfortunately, he is going back for more. But he was really stopped from having something as bad as it was. The Tree of Life synagogue was a horrible, horrible event, and he really did do a job. He made it so much better. It was so good to see him. I saw him in the hospital, and he was suffering, and he's still suffering. But he told me the other night he is so proud to have been a part. He was just a great, great gentleman. We introduced him the other night. The wonderful, young girl Grace, who overcame brain cancer , had no idea this was going to happen to her , and bravely rallied an entire community. And the intrepid soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy in the Allied liberation of Europe. On D-Day, all those warriors set out on their mission of liberation; President Franklin Delano Roosevelt led our nation in prayer. In a national radio address, President Roosevelt began with these solemn words: 'Almighty God: Our sons, the pride of our Nation, on this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization.' Since the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides , from gaining our independence, to abolition, of civil rights, to extending the vote for women , have been led by people of faith and started in prayer. When we open our hearts to faith, we fill our hearts with love. Many of the people in this room lead and support the charities and faith-based institutions that bring hope to the lives of our citizens, comfort to those in despair, and solace to those in grief, aid to those in need, and a helping hand to the struggling people all around the world, of which there are so many. With us today are leaders involved with Prison Fellowship, started by the late Chuck Colson , a man transformed by leaders of this breakfast. Today, Prison Fellowship ministers to more than 300,000 prisoners across America to help others like Alice Johnson and Matthew Charles, who we saw Tuesday night, transform their lives through the mercy and grace of God. And faith leaders helped us achieve historic bipartisan criminal justice reform. (Applause.) They've been wanting to do that for many, many years, and we all together got it done. We just passed the FIRST STEP Act into law. So thank you very much, everybody in the room, for that help. That was a very big thing for our country. (Applause.) America is a nation that believes in redemption. Every day, the people in this room demonstrate the power of faith to transform lives, heal communities, and lift up the forgotten.Some of those in this room are among the Muslim and Christian faith leaders from Minnesota who partnered to send millions of meals to Somalia last year. Also with us today are Catholics, Evangelicals, and members of the Jewish faith who help build homes for our fellow citizens through Habitat for Humanity. As President, I will always cherish, honor, and protect the believers who uplift our communities and sustain our nation.To ensure that people of faith can always contribute to our society, my administration has taken historic action to protect religious liberty. (Applause.) Here with us this morning are Melissa and Chad Buck from Holt, Michigan. In 2009, they decided to adopt. Soon, they got a call about three young siblings in a terribly abusive home. Melissa and Chad had only a few minutes to decide, and they said yes to all three. Today, the Bucks have five beautiful adopted children. As Melissa has said, 'They are the sweetest, most lovable children. They have the most unique gifts.' Two of them have joined us for this breakfast: 10-year-old Max and 9-year-old Liz. To Max, Liz, and the entire Buck family, thank you for inspiring us all. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Unfortunately, the Michigan adoption charity that brought the Buck family together is now defending itself in court for living by the values of its Catholic faith. We will always protect our country's long and proud tradition of faith-based adoption. (Applause.) My administration is working to ensure that faith-based adoption agencies are able to help vulnerable children find their forever families, while following their deeply held beliefs. (Applause.) My administration is also speaking out against religious persecution around the world, including against religious minorities, Christians, and the Jewish community. (Applause.) This week, I appointed a new Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, and with us , thank you very much , Elon Carr. Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.) A very effective person. The courageous Holocaust survivors in the gallery on Tuesday night powerfully remind us, and remind us all, of our solemn pledge: Never again. (Applause.) My administration is also continuing to fight for American hostages who have been imprisoned overseas for their religious beliefs. Last October, we reached an agreement with Turkey to release Pastor Andrew Brunson, who is now free and joins us here this morning. Where is Andrew? (Applause.) He was there for a long time before I got there, and I said, 'You've got to let him out.' (Laughter.) 'You better let him out.' And they let you out. (Laughter.) It was a miracle. (Applause.) Right? We spent a lot of time together. Terrific man. Terrific family. Thank you very much, Andrew. This Saturday, Pastor Brunson will walk his daughter down the aisle. Wow, that's great. Congratulations. Was I invited? I don't know. Was I invited? (Laughter.) He said, 'Yes.' Thank you. (Laughter.) To protect the dignity and worth of every person, my administration has taken historic action to combat human trafficking. Last year, I directed the State Department to cut off development aid to nations that do not demonstrate a commitment to ending human trafficking in their own countries. (Applause.) And we are fighting every day to stop the tragedy of human trafficking all along our southern border. Together, we will end the scourge of modern-day slavery that, because of the Internet, is at levels that nobody can believe. The Internet came along, and some good things happened. But some very bad things happened, and this is one of them. As part of our commitment to building a just and loving society, we must build a culture that cherishes the dignity and sanctity of innocent human life. (Applause.) All children, born and unborn, are made in the holy image of God. (Applause.) Thank you. Every life is sacred, and every soul is a precious gift from Heaven. As the Lord says in Jeremiah, 'Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you Before you were born, I set you apart.' Here with us today are Nikki and Tyler Watkinson. Our wonderful First Lady Melania, who is right now working very hard with a group of people and saying a few words on opioids , she's very much involved; she wanted to be here so badly, but she'll be here with us next year , recently met with them and, when she visited them at Children's Hospital, was so impressed. Last year, Nikki went into early labor during a blizzard. As she and Tyler were driving to the hospital, their son Grayson was born in the front seat. He was born four months premature, and weighed only 1 pound and 11 ounces. But he let out little, tiny cries, and he made it to the hospital alive. Nikki and Taylor's entire community began to lift up Grayson in their prayers, and, to the surprise of doctors, he kept on improving, improving, improving. After four months in the hospital, Nikki and Tyler brought home their beautiful baby boy. Just a few weeks ago, Grayson celebrated his first birthday. He is a beautiful, happy, healthy guy. (Applause.) Are they here? Where? Oh, good. (Applause.) Good. That's great. Beautiful. That's great. Thank you. As his mom, Nikki, has said, 'He was put on this Earth to do big things.' He may be here someday , right here. Nikki, he already has and he will do more and more as he grows older. As Jesus promises in the Bible, 'Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.' We are blessed to live in a land of faith where all things are possible. Our only limits are those we place on ourselves. So true. On Tuesday, I asked Americans to choose greatness. And everybody in that room stood and applauded. We asked for greatness , it's greatness for our country , and to renew our love and loyalty to one another , as friends, as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots, and as Americans. There could be no better way to begin this exciting national adventure than the way America has always begun our greatest adventures: by coming together in prayer.

And let us always give thanks for the miracle of life, the majesty of creation, and the grace of Almighty God. Thank you. It is an honor to be with you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)"}

This is an honor. Fifty-nine governors. Think of that. But we actually have , we added a few from the islands, so we broke it down to 49. But we love to exaggerate just a little bit. (Laughter.) This has been a , really, a great couple of days. We've had a lot of fun together. And it's been, you know, very special. We've gotten to know each other. We've gotten to like each other, in almost all cases. Let's see , one or two cases. Every case, I would say. (Laughter.) Every single case. I just want to thank Vice President Mike Pence and our Second Lady, Karen. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike, very much. And I especially want to thank our really great Cabinet for being here. We have most members of the Cabinet, and our great new Attorney General. And, Bill Barr and Mrs. Barr, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. I could say this: Our country is doing very, very well. We are doing record business. We're doing record employment. Right now, we have the most people working in our country than ever in the history of our country. Close to 160 million people. (Applause.) And that's a big , that's a big thing. And I'll give you a little advance information. I see Steve Mnuchin is here, and Ambassador Lighthizer. We just left a big meeting with China, and we just put out a statement, and we're doing very well with China. It was a long weekend. They decided to stay for two and a half more days. They'll probably be leaving late tonight; they're going back. And if all works well, we're going to have some very big news over the next week or two. And it's really been terrific, I tell you. That whole relationship has been outstanding. We put ourselves into a position of strength for the first time in about 35 years, or probably a lot more than that. But China has been terrific. We want to make a deal that's great for both countries. And that's really what we're going to be doing. And I think it's going to , as governors , most of you, or many of you are governors, and doing an incredible job. And so many have come up and said, \"How are you doing with China?\" Which is a very unusual question for people to come and ask , almost every one. \"Sir, how are you doing with China?\" Because it affects your state so much. China is everywhere. And I think you'll be very , really amazed with what you see. Maybe. Let's see what happens. We still have a little ways to go. Would you say that's correct, Mr. Ambassador? We have a little bit. But I want to thank you, Bob. You've been working 24 hours around the clock. And I will say this publicly: When I was able to be lucky enough to win the presidency, I called Bob Lighthizer because, for years, people have known he's the greatest trader that we have on this type of trade. We have many different types of trade. And I really understand now why. Thank you very much. Fantastic job. (Applause.) And Steve. Thank you. And also, I was going to leave very early tomorrow, but now I'm going to do it a little bit later. I had an option to do it at six in the morning or eleven. (Laughter.) And I chose 11. This way we can spend a little bit of time with you tomorrow morning, because you're having a breakfast. And I'll come to the breakfast. But literally, I said, \"What kind of an option is that? I can leave at six in the morning or eleven?\" They said, \"You can leave at six or anywhere between eleven and twelve.\" I said, \"I'll take eleven to twelve.\" (Laughter.) But you're having a breakfast tomorrow, so I'll be with you at the breakfast. But we'll be leaving for Hanoi, Vietnam, and we'll be meeting with Kim Jong Un. It's a very interesting thing to say, but I've developed a very, very good relationship. We'll see what that means. But he's never had a relationship with anybody from this country, and hasn't had lots of relationships anywhere. And I always say , you know, the media sometimes will say, \"Well, what have they given up?\" We've given up nothing. The sanctions are on. Everything is on. But we have a special feeling, and I think it's going to lead to something very good, and maybe not. I think ultimately it will, but maybe not. And I'm not pushing for speed, but we're not removing the sanctions. And we're going to have, I think, a very interesting two and a half days in Vietnam. And we have a chance for the total denuclearization of an area of the world that was very dangerous. When I first came in, or, really, more particularly, at the end of the last administration, there were rockets going up, there were missiles going up. There were bombs going off. There were massive cannons being tested. If you ever saw the picture of the beach, I've never seen anything like it, where you had, literally, thousands of cannons on the beach, shooting out into the waters. And there was nuclear testing. In fact, they thought it was earthquakes. They said they were massive earthquakes, and then they realized it was North Korea. They said, \"Wow, I think it's maybe not an earthquake.\" Now there's no testing, there's no rockets. There's no nuclear testing. And we get along well. Very well. So it'll be very interesting to see. And as I tell Chairman Kim, he has a chance to have a country that is so vibrant, economically. Maybe one of the most in the world. He's got a location that's unbelievable. As a real-estate person, I've always done very well with location. But he's right between China, Russia, and then on the other side, South Korea. So they can't touch each other unless they go through North Korea. And I say, \"You have one of the greatest locations.\" They have incredible people. Hardworking people. Smart, energetic. And I think it can be, really, one of the great , one of the great financial and economic countries anywhere in the world. So I tell him that. I said, \"But you can't do that if you're going to keep nuclear. If you do nuclear, that can't ever happen.\" And we see eye to eye, I believe. But you'll be seeing it more and more over the next couple of days, one way or the other. What's going to happen? I can't tell you. I think eventually it would, but I can't tell you. And I'm not in a rush. I don't want to rush anybody. I just don't want testing. As long as there's no testing, we're happy. And so we've done really something, I think, very special with respect to North Korea. And it's a long flight, and I'll be back at the end of the week. But we have two very interesting days planned, and I think it's a very important , it's a very important thing. Prime Minister Abe of Japan said he can't believe what's happened in such a short period of time, because rockets were being fired over Japan , rockets and missiles. Both. And now that hasn't happened in a long time , 16 months, 17 months. No more testing. No more rockets. No more checking to see whether or not this stuff works. So you'll be seeing it, and I think it's going to be very interesting for people to see. But there's a chance to do something very, very special. It's very exciting. And likewise, if we can do the great economic deal, it would be the largest trade deal ever made, by far, if you look at it , our deal with China. And we truly are very close. So those are a couple of very interesting things. But our country is doing incredibly well, economically. We've picked up, in terms of value , worth , $18 trillion. Now, China , and I don't want this , but China has lost about $24 trillion. So they were catching us, catching us, catching us. And now we've zoomed out. And I can say this: As long as I'm President, they're not going to catch us, and they're going to do well. But I want them to do well, but they're not going to catch us. So I just want to give a toast to the incredible people in this room and to our unbelievable country. We have a very, very special country. I want to thank our First Lady for having done , this is a such a beautiful job. So, Melania, I just want to thank you very much. (Applause.) I want to thank you. And I would like to ask Governor Bullock to come up please, from a very special place that I like very much, for the obvious reason. And perhaps you could give a toast. Please. Thank you, Governor. Thank you very much.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1323855\/remarks-by-president-trump-at-2019-governors-ball&speechType=1","Summary":"Foreign Affairs","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-2019-governors-ball\/","CleanText":"Thank you very much, everybody.

We will not rest as we continue our work to bring the remaining American hostages back home. Today, we join Danny and his family in celebrating his return."}

(Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Please. Thank you very much. As governors, we all sort of get together and we have a good time. But we also , we're going to accomplish a lot. This going to be a very good meeting. Tremendous things are happening for our country. I'm now , right after this meeting, I leave for Vietnam, where I meet with Chairman Kim and we talk about something that, frankly, he never spoke to anybody about. But we're speaking, and we're speaking loud. And I think we can have a very good , a very good summit. I think we'll have a very tremendous summit. We want denuclearization, and I think he'll have a country that will set a lot of records for speed in terms of an economy. And I told you last night , it was a lovely dinner , but I told you how well we did with our trade talks in China. And it looks like they'll be coming back quickly again. And we're going to have another summit. We're going to have a signing summit, which is even better. So hopefully, we can get that completed. But we're getting very, very close. Ambassador Lighthizer, Steve Mnuchin, a lot of folks in the room have been helping and that's been great. And I just see our great Secretary sitting there. On drug prices, first time in 54 years that drug prices have actually gone down this year. So, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much. That's a great, great deal. (Applause.) Today, it's my honor to welcome our nation's governors back to the White House after a wonderful evening last night. And I'm deeply grateful for your presence, your partnership, and your friendship , many of you are such good friends , as we work together on behalf of all Americans. We're here to forge bonds of cooperation between our federal, state, and local governments as we strive to deliver a safe, bright, and prosperous future for every community in our magnificent nation. Thank you as well to all of my Cabinet Secretaries who are here today to share their energy, expertise, and devotion. They are devoted. They work so hard and they're doing a terrific job. There are few , I say there are none , but there are few administrations that have accomplished what we've accomplished over the last two years and the first two years. It's been pretty incredible with tax cuts and regulation cuts , more regulations than any other administration in history, and that's very important. And we still have regulation. But you don't have 10 of identical regulations that you have to get approved and wiped out from different departments. So we've really cut it down. A highway that would take 17 or 18 years of approval now takes probably two. And we're trying to get it down to one. And it may be rejected on various grounds, including environmental. But we have it down to two, and we think we can get it down further. So it will be , that will be something. You know. You have many highways and many roadways, and they're tied up for many years. And that won't be happening too much anymore. In my State of the Union Address, I outlined many bipartisan priorities that we all share: delivering fair trade; rebuilding our nation's infrastructure , which we are going to work very hard on, because as governors, that has to be music to your ears. (Applause.) And I would like , on infrastructure, I would like you to call your senators and call your congressmen and women and get it done, because I'm ready. I want to sign. I am totally ready. Reducing the price of healthcare and prescription drugs , and we've made a lot of progress, as I said. First year in 54 years that prescription prices have gone down, which is a big statement. But we can get them a lot lower. We're in the process, Mr. Secretary, of doing that. Creating a safe and lawful immigration system, and keeping America safe. We're gathered today at a truly incredible time for our nation. Things are happening like rarely ever before. Since the election, we've created more than 5.3 million new jobs, including a half a million brand-new manufacturing jobs. And that number is going to go over 600,000 manufacturing jobs in just a very short period of time. And if you remember, manufacturing jobs were never coming back to our country. Well, they are coming back and they're coming back very strongly. And we have companies opening up in the United States that we thought we lost, that would never be back, and some are coming back and some are brand new and they're big. And they're coming in and they're moving in, which is one of the reasons we need people to come in. They have to come in through a legal process. But with a 3.7 [percent] unemployment, we need to have people coming in. We need workers, frankly, because we have all of these companies pouring in. We were just discussing , our great new governor of Michigan , last night, where you have some good news coming up very soon. And we have car companies opening up in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and so many other places. I was with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and he was saying it could be seven different plants in a very short period of time, not to mention all of the plants that have already opened. So, we need people. We have to have people and they have to come in, but they have to come in legally and through merit. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps during this very short period of time. Blue-collar jobs are growing at their fastest pace in many decades. The unemployment rates for African Americans , and you've heard this many times , Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. And with women, it's now 64 years. Lowest in 64 years. Soon, it will be historic. So America now has, really, the hottest economy on Earth. Whenever I greet a prime minister or a president, or any leaders of any countries, they always start off by saying, \"Congratulations on your economy. It's been incredible. Congratulations.\" And many of them are trying to follow our formula, which was cutting taxes, cutting regulations, and many other things. We give incentives and we work very hard at getting companies to come back in. Those companies that left, we , in particular, we want to work. They left our country. They fired all of their workers. They moved to another country. They're now coming back. It's a great thing. In a few moments, our first session on vocational training and workforce development will begin. We want every citizen to gain the cutting-edge skills they need to enjoy a rewarding, lifelong career. Many of the governors here today have identified this as a very top priority. My daughter, Ivanka, who is going to be speaking later, is , she has been so much involved. So incredibly involved. Where is Ivanka? Ivanka, keep , keep going. (Laughter.) Created , my daughter has created millions of jobs. I don't know if anyone knows that, but she's created millions of jobs. (Applause.) So, because of our roaring economy, there are more opportunities than ever before to get sidelined workers , and these are people that lost jobs and have never gotten them back, but now they're coming back and very, very rapidly , get these sidelined workers back into the labor force. Last year, my administration created the Council for American Worker and launched the Pledge of America's Workers, where we've gained commitments from private sector leaders to hire and train more than 6.5 million Americans. Think of it: 6.5 million. And these are jobs that, for the most part, would not have happened. I was also proud to sign a modernized Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act into law. We believe two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American. It used to be a terrible thing when you said \"America first.\" People said all sorts of things: \"It's terrible. It's a horror.\" It's \"America First.\" It's \"Make America Great Again.\" (Applause.) It's whatever you want to call it, but that's the way it is. I mean, you know very well. And some can't say, and some can say proudly, but we would focus so much on other countries, it was almost like we put those , not almost. We put those countries ahead of ours. We actually took those countries and put them ahead of ours. We can't do it. And we're going to help other countries that we have great relationships. But we can't do that anymore. It's America first. Today, we also will discuss the bold action we took to address economic inequality by establishing Opportunity Zones as part of our historic tax cuts. It's incredible what's going on. I don't know, I think some of you really see it. Okay? You see what's going with the Opportunity Zones. Far greater than anybody thought. And we've done a lot of them, and they have great incentives. And money is being put in by very rich people and rich companies in areas that you would have said nobody will ever invest in. We established incentives for investment in more than 8,700 distressed areas that you have designated in each of your states. You're designating some tough places. I say, \"Can they give us some tougher places than that?\" They are tough and it's , incredibly, for the first time ever, it's really working. The concept was always good but it wasn't done properly. I want to thank you for partnering with us in this critical effort to lift up neglected and totally forgotten communities. I also want to thank every governor here today who is supporting our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement , the USMCA. (Applause.) I've long said that NAFTA is the worst trade deal that any country has ever signed. It emptied us out. We had a surplus with Mexico and Canada, and we went to $130 billion trade deficit with the combination of Mexico and Canada. And this deal will bring it back. We're opening it up to farmers. We're opening Canada, as an example , and Mexico , to farmers. They were closed. It was a closed shop. They had all sorts of non-monetary trade barriers. And they had monetary trade barriers. They were charging, for certain agricultural products, an almost 300 percent tariff. Nobody ever talked about it. Nobody ever knew about it. And I'd go up to Wisconsin and the farmers would say, \"Sir, we can't compete. They're charging us 287 percent, to be exact.\" I said, \"You got to be kidding.\" And we did something about it. So the USMCA is very important. It will help our dairy farmers in Wisconsin; our wine makers in Oregon and Washington and California; our autoworkers in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and all over; and dozens of other states, and ranchers and farmers and growers and manufacturers from coast to coast. It's a very, very comprehensive deal. It's a deal that nobody thought we'd be able to get approved. I was able to get it approved, to be honest with you, by using tariffs. I was putting very substantial tariffs , or was getting ready to , on Canada, who was very tough to negotiate. You know, we think of \"Oh, Canada.\" Well, \"Oh, Canada\" is tough. They're tough. (Laughter.) And I said, \"Look, you know, you're either going to do this or we're going to put 20, 25 percent tariffs on your cars that you ship in here by the millions. And every time we had a problem, we'd just say, \"That's okay. Don't worry about it. We'll put the tariffs on.\" And they said, \"Okay. Fine. It's okay. We'll sign.\" It was a tough , it was a really tough negotiation. And same thing with Mexico. But in the end, we got it done and it's a great deal for us, and it's a very good deal, I think, for Canada and for Mexico. They have to get it approved also. We have to get it approved. Let's see what happens. And I think it probably will be. It should , I think from our standpoint , I know how much they hate me, but they have to hate me even more not to get this deal approved. Okay? That's the only thing I can say. To be a prosperous nation, we must also be a safe nation. We passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. And I have to thank so many people for that. But this was where super- conservatives got together with super-liberals, believe it or not. I mean, I'm looking at names on both sides and right down the middle. Criminal justice reform, where people are put into jail for a pretty minor act , there's nothing minor , but a pretty minor act, and they're put in jail for 45 years and 50 years and there's no chance of ever coming out. And it was a very , and it's very tough, by the way. A lot of conservatives signed it, and signed it very willingly. In fact, they pushed it. They were pushing it, I think, as hard as the other side. But it's very, very important. Many states here today are following the same roadmap to help former inmates become productive and law-abiding citizens. And one of the thing that's helping the inmates so much , you know this probably better than I do , the economy is so strong that inmates, for the first time, are getting jobs when they come out. And I have a friend who's hired seven or eight. I can't say every one was perfect, but he said, \"Five are , I'll always have them. They're great.\" They got a chance. Nobody would hire them because they have that , whatever it is in the background. And it's a very tough situation for them in the past. But the economy is so strong. The economy , the strength of the economy became our best friend. They couldn't get workers, and now they're hiring people that they normally wouldn't have. And the results are incredible. Companies all over the country are saying, \"Wow, they are really , they're really doing a great job.\" And it makes me very happy. I think without that very powerful economy it couldn't happen. So, finally, to protect our communities, we must secure the border against human trafficking, drug smuggling, and crime of all types. The human trafficking is a tremendous problem where, mostly women, and they're tied up and they're taped up, and they're put in the back of cars, and the car does not come through the port of entry. I mean, you watch this , \"Everything comes through it.\" Ninety percent of the drugs don't come through the port of entry. Ninety percent of the drugs and the big stuff goes out to the desert, makes a left, and goes where you don't have any wall. I'm going to call it a wall. You know, they'd like me to call it a barrier. It's a wall. It's a big, beautiful, powerful steel wall that you can see through , which is very important to be able to see through. And if you don't have it, you're not going to have borders, you're not going to have a country pretty soon. Because we're spending a fortune. We're doing an incredible job. The Border Patrol has been amazing. The military has been amazing. I called in the military and they've been amazing. But if we had a wall, we'd save a fortune not only on drugs that are being smuggled into the country. And you're talking about billions and billions and billions of dollars' worth of drugs. But we'd save it just on not having to pay military, not having to pay so much on the Border Patrol. The Border Patrol can go to other locations and other places. But I'll say this: Border Patrol and ICE , and I'm proud of ICE because they go into areas where a lot of people don't want to go, including law enforcement. These are tough, tough people that they're dealing with. And you need tough people. The ICE people, they're tough but they're incredible. I mean, they're just incredible in so many ways. They are patriotic people. They love our country. They want it to work. And they'll go into situations that you want no part of. When you look at these MS-13 gangs, sheriffs all over the country have told me, \"We're very happy to have ICE come in and take over.\" Because this is a group of people that , hard to even understand how they could have developed this way. They're mean. They're sadistic. Their crimes are incredible. We're taking them out by the thousands, and we're bringing them back to where they came from. And in some cases, we're putting them in jail. But, you know, then we pay for them for the next 40 years. But we're bringing them back where they came from. And I told Guatemala and I told Honduras, and I told El Salvador , three places where they send us tremendous numbers of people , and they're rough people. They're not sending us their finest. It doesn't make sense. Why would they send their finest? They're sending us some very , as I would sometimes say , rough hombres. These are rough, rough, tough people. Many criminal people. And I told these three countries , you know, we send them $500 million a year. I said, \"We're not sending it anymore.\" And you organize caravans, and these caravans that are coming up , we had one , and we've broken them up. I don't know if you've been seeing. We've broken them up. We've gotten them broken up, in many cases now, before they get here. But you take a look at Tijuana, Mexico: Thousands and thousands of people are sitting there, trying to get into our country. And if we didn't have a wall there , that we've totally renovated and fixed , if we didn't have that wall, it would be impossible even for the military to stop them. Because don't forget, unlike other countries , and this is a good thing; I don't want to create controversy because I hate controversy, believe me. (Laughter.) But unlike other countries, we don't let people get shot. You know? We don't have people standing there with the most sophisticated machine guns in the world and use them. Many countries do. Many countries do. We can't do that. We can't do that. This country can't do that. But the barrier does it very simply. It just doesn't let them in. So you take a look at a place like Tijuana and other places. It's incredible what that wall has done. And that's not even the upper , you know, the most , the best of our walls. We have a great system now. We have a prototype. We have , I expect to have 250 to 300 miles of wall built in the very near future. Secretary Nielsen is here right now, and we have , we will shortly have about 200 miles under construction. We just started a 47-mile patch. We have different patches. We bid it out tough. We have a much better prototype. It's actually a beautiful wall. It's a beautiful-looking , actually , you know, I've always said part of the wall was that previous administrations, when they did little walls, they built them so badly. So badly. It's so unattractive. So , I wouldn't want them in my backyard. And the new one is incredible looking. It's a piece of art, in a sense. It's still , and it's, by the way, more effective. I mean, it's more effective. So we are doing a job. We're getting it up. We have beautiful prototypes. We're working with the Army Corps of Engineers. We're total pros. And I don't know if you saw what I put on Twitter, but I put on Twitter a piece of it. That's not the new prototype; the new prototype has started in different locations. But we're going to be, pretty soon, having well over a couple of hundred miles of wall up. We don't have to go 2,000. We never planned on going 2,000. It's 2,000 from the Gulf to the Pacific; it's 2,000 miles. But you have many natural boundaries, including really tough waters, which you don't need the wall. We have very, very rugged mountain areas, which you don't need the wall. Actually, if we do a really good job, and if we have some money left over, we might even throw them in areas where you would say you don't need them because they'll figure a way. That will be the area. That will become the weak spot. It's like water; it just seeks its own. But these people, they have the traffickers. They're vicious, they're smart , the coyotes. How about the name \"coyote\"? They have people tied up, put in the back of trucks and vans. They can't go through checkpoints. They have to go through open areas. Can't walk through. You can't go through it. Because even if they don't do much of an inspection of your truck or your car, they do open the back door, or they do look through a window. You can't have women sitting there that are tied up. So when I hear the other side say , and we have some of the other side here. But when I hear the other side say, \"Oh, no, everything goes through the checkpoint,\" that's absolutely false. You have areas where you literally have roads that are carved in the sand that it's used so much. They go right through these roads. They go right, they hang a left and hang another left, and \"Welcome to the United States.\" There's nobody there to even talk to them. Because you're talking about 2,000 miles. You're talking about a lot of area. So we're doing really well on the wall , the emergency you've all been reading. We do have an emergency. We have an emergency of people pouring into our country that we don't want , criminals, smugglers. We have drugs pouring into our country. We can't have it. We can't have it. We cannot allow this to happy to our country. Most drugs , most of the major drugs are coming through the southern border. This will make it , you're never going to stop it completely, but we can stop it a lot. One of the things that Ambassador Lighthizer and Steve, and all of the people that are working with China , the fentanyl is a tremendous problem. It seems to be made 100 percent in China. A hundred percent. Now, China is paying us, right now, billions and billions of dollars of tariffs a month. Every month, billions of dollars. I love it. Personally, I love it. But they're paying billions of dollars. And it's hurting them; it's not good for them. And I said to President Xi , I said, \"President, you have to do me a favor. As part of our trade deal \" , it has nothing to do with trade, or certainly very little , but we're having shipped over here, from China, fentanyl. It's killing 88,000 people a year, and probably more. That's just the ones we know about. It's deadly. A little tiny spoonful can wipe out a state, it's hard to believe. It can wipe out an entire state, a spoonful of this stuff. And in China, they have a very, very tough penalty for drugs. It's called the death penalty. And I said to President Xi, \"You don't have much of a drug problem. Do you have a drug problem?\" \"No. No drug problem.\" I said, \"So you have 1.4 billion people, and you don't have a drug problem?\" \"That's right. No drug problem.\" I said, \"What do you attribute that to?\" \"Death penalty. Quick trial.\" They don't have trials that last 19 years. At the end of a , the judge dies. Everybody dies. The only one living is the one that did the damage. No, they have what's called a \"quick trial.\" It goes quick. It doesn't take a lot of time. And if you're a drug dealer, you'll say, \"You know what , maybe I'll just sort of stay out of China.\" Singapore, the same thing. So I said to President Xi , I said, \"You know, if you would criminalize the sale of fentanyl into the United States, you would be saving many, many lives.\" It took me one minute, and he agreed. Because it's not criminalized. I think they view it as an industrial drug or something. It's not criminalized. And as part of our deal , and, Bob, don't forget to put that down , but as part of our deal, I think we're going to get a criminalization of fentanyl being sold into the United States. It'll stop. (Applause.) It'll stop. Very important. And I have to tell you, I have to really thank President Xi, both for that, and he has been a big help with respect to North Korea. I have a very, very good relationship with Kim Jong Un. Very, very good. But we need all the help we can get. And as you know, about 92 percent of the goods going into North Korea go through China. And President Xi has been very good. He's been very, very good. Now, you know, it helps that we are in a strong trading position. But nevertheless, he's been very strong and he's, for the most part, held it. At the beginning, he was perfect. I told him the other day, \"At the beginning, you were perfect. Now you're good. Not quite as good. You got to get better.\" But maybe we'll make a deal and then we won't have to worry about that any longer. So that will be something really great. But he's been great. And the fentanyl is , they're already working on that process. And, you know, I said, \"Do you need any other approvals?\" \"No.\" I said, \"Well, that works a lot different than this country.\" (Laughter.) He needs no other approval. When I got the basketball players out , the three basketball players , that was a beautiful scene. I was in China. And you have these three, you know, potential stars , and I guess they're going into the NBA draft, or just have , but I said, \"Would you do me a favor? Three players were just arrested.\" They were arrested for stealing , in Louis Vuitton , sunglasses. And I wasn't happy with those three players because they never gave our country much credit for having gotten them out. And believe me, they'd be in jail. Stealing in a store in China is a very big offense. And I said, \"Would you do me a favor?\" I was having dinner with him at this incredible show that he put on in a ballroom, the likes of which few people have ever seen. It was an incredible evening. Melania is here. And I'm talking. And it just happened and they were arrested. They were put in jail. And I said, \"Mr. President, could you do me a favor? Could you let the three basketball players out?\" He didn't know about it. He called over to his people. He's got 10 people standing behind him; every one is a central casting. Central casting. (Laughter.) Glasses, pad , boom. He went over , he came back. He reported within two minutes, explained, \"Basketball players \" Bom. Bom. And I said, \"It would be a great thing if you could possibly let them out.\" He goes, \"So be it. They're out.\" I thought , I said, \"Is this different than our country?\" Huh? (Laughter.) It's just a little bit different. And we got them out. Then we came back, and the one father said, \"Well, we don't know that Trump helped. I sent a consultant.\" That consultant would've gotten nowhere. But, you know, we just have a great relationship with so many of these countries. And I think in some cases it's tough. There are many countries that take advantage of us very seriously, both at NATO and on trade. The European Union is very, very tough. Very, very tough. They don't allow our products in. They don't allow our farming goods in. You people know. Many of you represent farm states. They won't , you know that better than anybody. They won't allow our farm products in. They don't take any. They have these non-, you know, monetary barriers that are brutal. They're worse than the , you know, than others. The cars , they charge us big tariffs. And it's very hard for a car to get in, number one. But if it does, they have to pay a big tariff, whereas we charge them almost nothing when they send their cars to us , Mercedes and BMW, and all of the things that they send. So we're taking care of it. I mean, we've informed them that, \"Look, if you don't , if you're not going play ball \" President Obama, in eight years, couldn't do a thing. They wouldn't even meet with him. They said, \"We have no intention of meeting.\" They wouldn't even meet with President Obama. They wouldn't meet with President Bush. EU is one of the toughest , maybe the toughest. Maybe, in certain ways, tougher than China, just smaller, from our standpoint. But they have to meet. And we told them, \"Have to meet. Sorry. And if you don't meet, we're going to tariff the hell out of you.\" And they're going to meet. I mean, they're going to meet. But we lost last year with the European Union $151 billion. This has been going on for many years. Think of it , $151 billion. We take their product; they don't take ours. We don't charge them tariffs; they charge us tariffs. Other than that, it's a very fair arrangement. And, by the way, we pay for their military. Because we pay almost, getting close to 100 percent for their military. I've gotten them to put up over $100 billion toward NATO, which has made a big impact. But , so they have to treat us fairly. We want to have a great relationship. I have a great relationship with the leaders. But we have to be treated fairly. So, overall, we're doing a great job for our country. Our country has rarely done better. Maybe never done better from an economy standpoint. We're very proud of it. And we have tremendous potential when we fix these trade deals, because we're being ripped by everybody. We are just being ripped, because we lose $800 billion a year on trade. Think of it. It's incon- , $800 billion. Nobody even knows what that means. And we're fixing that all up. We start with Mexico, Canada, China. China is the big one. China is 50 percent of the number , even more. And we're doing very well. That could happen fairly soon, or it might not happen at all. Okay? Might not happen at all, but I think it's going to happen and it could happen fairly soon. The relationship is great. So I just want to thank all of the governors for being here. You're very special people. I think we have 17 brand-new governors. Right? Brand new ones. Very smart ones, like my friend. Huh? Congratulations. It's a great , you're going to have , you have such an easy state. (Laughter.) That's so easy. Great state of Illinois. What an easy state. I don't know. Huh? Have you found it to be easier or tougher than you thought? GOVERNOR PRITZKER: Well, you're going to help us out. (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: I'll help you out. I help everybody out. I'm going to help you. Congratulations. It's an honor to have you all at the White House. Thank you very much. Thank you.

We want denuclearization, and I think he'll have a country that will set a lot of records for speed in terms of an economy.

And we're going to have another summit. We're going to have a signing summit, which is even better. So hopefully, we can get that completed. But we're getting very, very close. Ambassador Lighthizer, Steve Mnuchin, a lot of folks in the room have been helping and that's been great. And I just see our great Secretary sitting there. On drug prices, first time in 54 years that drug prices have actually gone down this year. So, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much. That's a great, great deal. (Applause.) Today, it's my honor to welcome our nation's governors back to the White House after a wonderful evening last night. And I'm deeply grateful for your presence, your partnership, and your friendship , many of you are such good friends , as we work together on behalf of all Americans. We're here to forge bonds of cooperation between our federal, state, and local governments as we strive to deliver a safe, bright, and prosperous future for every community in our magnificent nation. Thank you as well to all of my Cabinet Secretaries who are here today to share their energy, expertise, and devotion. They are devoted. They work so hard and they're doing a terrific job. There are few , I say there are none , but there are few administrations that have accomplished what we've accomplished over the last two years and the first two years. It's been pretty incredible with tax cuts and regulation cuts , more regulations than any other administration in history, and that's very important. And we still have regulation. But you don't have 10 of identical regulations that you have to get approved and wiped out from different departments. So we've really cut it down. A highway that would take 17 or 18 years of approval now takes probably two. And we're trying to get it down to one. And it may be rejected on various grounds, including environmental. But we have it down to two, and we think we can get it down further. So it will be , that will be something. You know. You have many highways and many roadways, and they're tied up for many years. And that won't be happening too much anymore. In my State of the Union Address, I outlined many bipartisan priorities that we all share: delivering fair trade; rebuilding our nation's infrastructure , which we are going to work very hard on, because as governors, that has to be music to your ears. (Applause.) And I would like , on infrastructure, I would like you to call your senators and call your congressmen and women and get it done, because I'm ready. I want to sign. I am totally ready. Reducing the price of healthcare and prescription drugs , and we've made a lot of progress, as I said. First year in 54 years that prescription prices have gone down, which is a big statement. But we can get them a lot lower. We're in the process, Mr. Secretary, of doing that. Creating a safe and lawful immigration system, and keeping America safe. We're gathered today at a truly incredible time for our nation. Things are happening like rarely ever before. Since the election, we've created more than 5.3 million new jobs, including a half a million brand-new manufacturing jobs. And that number is going to go over 600,000 manufacturing jobs in just a very short period of time. And if you remember, manufacturing jobs were never coming back to our country. Well, they are coming back and they're coming back very strongly. And we have companies opening up in the United States that we thought we lost, that would never be back, and some are coming back and some are brand new and they're big. And they're coming in and they're moving in, which is one of the reasons we need people to come in. They have to come in through a legal process. But with a 3.7 unemployment, we need to have people coming in. We need workers, frankly, because we have all of these companies pouring in. We were just discussing , our great new governor of Michigan , last night, where you have some good news coming up very soon. And we have car companies opening up in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and so many other places. I was with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and he was saying it could be seven different plants in a very short period of time, not to mention all of the plants that have already opened. So, we need people. We have to have people and they have to come in, but they have to come in legally and through merit. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps during this very short period of time. Blue-collar jobs are growing at their fastest pace in many decades. The unemployment rates for African Americans , and you've heard this many times , Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. And with women, it's now 64 years. Lowest in 64 years. Soon, it will be historic. So America now has, really, the hottest economy on Earth. Whenever I greet a prime minister or a president, or any leaders of any countries, they always start off by saying, 'Congratulations on your economy. It's been incredible. Congratulations.' And many of them are trying to follow our formula, which was cutting taxes, cutting regulations, and many other things. We give incentives and we work very hard at getting companies to come back in. Those companies that left, we , in particular, we want to work. They left our country. They fired all of their workers. They moved to another country. They're now coming back. It's a great thing. In a few moments, our first session on vocational training and workforce development will begin. We want every citizen to gain the cutting-edge skills they need to enjoy a rewarding, lifelong career. Many of the governors here today have identified this as a very top priority. My daughter, Ivanka, who is going to be speaking later, is , she has been so much involved. So incredibly involved. Where is Ivanka? Ivanka, keep , keep going. (Laughter.) Created , my daughter has created millions of jobs. I don't know if anyone knows that, but she's created millions of jobs. (Applause.) So, because of our roaring economy, there are more opportunities than ever before to get sidelined workers , and these are people that lost jobs and have never gotten them back, but now they're coming back and very, very rapidly , get these sidelined workers back into the labor force. Last year, my administration created the Council for American Worker and launched the Pledge of America's Workers, where we've gained commitments from private sector leaders to hire and train more than 6.5 million Americans. Think of it: 6.5 million. And these are jobs that, for the most part, would not have happened. I was also proud to sign a modernized Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act into law. We believe two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American. It used to be a terrible thing when you said 'America first.' People said all sorts of things: 'It's terrible. It's a horror.' It's 'America First.' It's 'Make America Great Again.' (Applause.) It's whatever you want to call it, but that's the way it is. I mean, you know very well. And some can't say, and some can say proudly, but we would focus so much on other countries, it was almost like we put those , not almost. We put those countries ahead of ours. We actually took those countries and put them ahead of ours. We can't do it. And we're going to help other countries that we have great relationships. But we can't do that anymore. It's America first. Today, we also will discuss the bold action we took to address economic inequality by establishing Opportunity Zones as part of our historic tax cuts. It's incredible what's going on. I don't know, I think some of you really see it. Okay? You see what's going with the Opportunity Zones. Far greater than anybody thought. And we've done a lot of them, and they have great incentives. And money is being put in by very rich people and rich companies in areas that you would have said nobody will ever invest in. We established incentives for investment in more than 8,700 distressed areas that you have designated in each of your states. You're designating some tough places. I say, 'Can they give us some tougher places than that?' They are tough and it's , incredibly, for the first time ever, it's really working. The concept was always good but it wasn't done properly. I want to thank you for partnering with us in this critical effort to lift up neglected and totally forgotten communities. I also want to thank every governor here today who is supporting our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement , the USMCA. (Applause.) I've long said that NAFTA is the worst trade deal that any country has ever signed. It emptied us out. We had a surplus with Mexico and Canada, and we went to $130 billion trade deficit with the combination of Mexico and Canada. And this deal will bring it back. We're opening it up to farmers. We're opening Canada, as an example , and Mexico , to farmers. They were closed. It was a closed shop. They had all sorts of non-monetary trade barriers. And they had monetary trade barriers. They were charging, for certain agricultural products, an almost 300 percent tariff. Nobody ever talked about it. Nobody ever knew about it. And I'd go up to Wisconsin and the farmers would say, 'Sir, we can't compete. They're charging us 287 percent, to be exact.' I said, 'You got to be kidding.' And we did something about it. So the USMCA is very important. It will help our dairy farmers in Wisconsin; our wine makers in Oregon and Washington and California; our autoworkers in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and all over; and dozens of other states, and ranchers and farmers and growers and manufacturers from coast to coast. It's a very, very comprehensive deal. It's a deal that nobody thought we'd be able to get approved. I was able to get it approved, to be honest with you, by using tariffs. I was putting very substantial tariffs , or was getting ready to , on Canada, who was very tough to negotiate. You know, we think of 'Oh, Canada.' Well, 'Oh, Canada' is tough. They're tough. (Laughter.) And I said, 'Look, you know, you're either going to do this or we're going to put 20, 25 percent tariffs on your cars that you ship in here by the millions. And every time we had a problem, we'd just say, 'That's okay. Don't worry about it. We'll put the tariffs on.' And they said, 'Okay. Fine. It's okay. We'll sign.' It was a tough , it was a really tough negotiation. And same thing with Mexico. But in the end, we got it done and it's a great deal for us, and it's a very good deal, I think, for Canada and for Mexico. They have to get it approved also. We have to get it approved. Let's see what happens. And I think it probably will be. It should , I think from our standpoint , I know how much they hate me, but they have to hate me even more not to get this deal approved. Okay? That's the only thing I can say. To be a prosperous nation, we must also be a safe nation. We passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. And I have to thank so many people for that. But this was where super- conservatives got together with super-liberals, believe it or not. I mean, I'm looking at names on both sides and right down the middle. Criminal justice reform, where people are put into jail for a pretty minor act , there's nothing minor , but a pretty minor act, and they're put in jail for 45 years and 50 years and there's no chance of ever coming out. And it was a very , and it's very tough, by the way. A lot of conservatives signed it, and signed it very willingly. In fact, they pushed it. They were pushing it, I think, as hard as the other side. But it's very, very important. Many states here today are following the same roadmap to help former inmates become productive and law-abiding citizens. And one of the thing that's helping the inmates so much , you know this probably better than I do , the economy is so strong that inmates, for the first time, are getting jobs when they come out. And I have a friend who's hired seven or eight. I can't say every one was perfect, but he said, 'Five are , I'll always have them. They're great.' They got a chance. Nobody would hire them because they have that , whatever it is in the background. And it's a very tough situation for them in the past. But the economy is so strong. The economy , the strength of the economy became our best friend. They couldn't get workers, and now they're hiring people that they normally wouldn't have. And the results are incredible. Companies all over the country are saying, 'Wow, they are really , they're really doing a great job.' And it makes me very happy. I think without that very powerful economy it couldn't happen. So, finally, to protect our communities, we must secure the border against human trafficking, drug smuggling, and crime of all types. The human trafficking is a tremendous problem where, mostly women, and they're tied up and they're taped up, and they're put in the back of cars, and the car does not come through the port of entry. I mean, you watch this , 'Everything comes through it.' Ninety percent of the drugs don't come through the port of entry. Ninety percent of the drugs and the big stuff goes out to the desert, makes a left, and goes where you don't have any wall. I'm going to call it a wall. You know, they'd like me to call it a barrier. It's a wall. It's a big, beautiful, powerful steel wall that you can see through , which is very important to be able to see through. And if you don't have it, you're not going to have borders, you're not going to have a country pretty soon. Because we're spending a fortune. We're doing an incredible job. The Border Patrol has been amazing. The military has been amazing. I called in the military and they've been amazing. But if we had a wall, we'd save a fortune not only on drugs that are being smuggled into the country. And you're talking about billions and billions and billions of dollars' worth of drugs. But we'd save it just on not having to pay military, not having to pay so much on the Border Patrol. The Border Patrol can go to other locations and other places. But I'll say this: Border Patrol and ICE , and I'm proud of ICE because they go into areas where a lot of people don't want to go, including law enforcement. These are tough, tough people that they're dealing with. And you need tough people. The ICE people, they're tough but they're incredible. I mean, they're just incredible in so many ways. They are patriotic people. They love our country. They want it to work. And they'll go into situations that you want no part of. When you look at these MS-13 gangs, sheriffs all over the country have told me, 'We're very happy to have ICE come in and take over.' Because this is a group of people that , hard to even understand how they could have developed this way. They're mean. They're sadistic. Their crimes are incredible. We're taking them out by the thousands, and we're bringing them back to where they came from. And in some cases, we're putting them in jail. But, you know, then we pay for them for the next 40 years. But we're bringing them back where they came from. And I told Guatemala and I told Honduras, and I told El Salvador , three places where they send us tremendous numbers of people , and they're rough people. They're not sending us their finest. It doesn't make sense. Why would they send their finest? They're sending us some very , as I would sometimes say , rough hombres. These are rough, rough, tough people. Many criminal people. And I told these three countries , you know, we send them $500 million a year. I said, 'We're not sending it anymore.' And you organize caravans, and these caravans that are coming up , we had one , and we've broken them up. I don't know if you've been seeing. We've broken them up. We've gotten them broken up, in many cases now, before they get here. But you take a look at Tijuana, Mexico: Thousands and thousands of people are sitting there, trying to get into our country. And if we didn't have a wall there , that we've totally renovated and fixed , if we didn't have that wall, it would be impossible even for the military to stop them. Because don't forget, unlike other countries , and this is a good thing; I don't want to create controversy because I hate controversy, believe me. (Laughter.) But unlike other countries, we don't let people get shot. You know? We don't have people standing there with the most sophisticated machine guns in the world and use them. Many countries do. Many countries do. We can't do that. We can't do that. This country can't do that. But the barrier does it very simply. It just doesn't let them in. So you take a look at a place like Tijuana and other places. It's incredible what that wall has done. And that's not even the upper , you know, the most , the best of our walls. We have a great system now. We have a prototype. We have , I expect to have 250 to 300 miles of wall built in the very near future. Secretary Nielsen is here right now, and we have , we will shortly have about 200 miles under construction. We just started a 47-mile patch. We have different patches. We bid it out tough. We have a much better prototype. It's actually a beautiful wall. It's a beautiful-looking , actually , you know, I've always said part of the wall was that previous administrations, when they did little walls, they built them so badly. So badly. It's so unattractive. So , I wouldn't want them in my backyard. And the new one is incredible looking. It's a piece of art, in a sense. It's still , and it's, by the way, more effective. I mean, it's more effective. So we are doing a job. We're getting it up. We have beautiful prototypes. We're working with the Army Corps of Engineers. We're total pros. And I don't know if you saw what I put on Twitter, but I put on Twitter a piece of it. That's not the new prototype; the new prototype has started in different locations. But we're going to be, pretty soon, having well over a couple of hundred miles of wall up. We don't have to go 2,000. We never planned on going 2,000. It's 2,000 from the Gulf to the Pacific; it's 2,000 miles. But you have many natural boundaries, including really tough waters, which you don't need the wall. We have very, very rugged mountain areas, which you don't need the wall. Actually, if we do a really good job, and if we have some money left over, we might even throw them in areas where you would say you don't need them because they'll figure a way. That will be the area. That will become the weak spot. It's like water; it just seeks its own. But these people, they have the traffickers. They're vicious, they're smart , the coyotes. How about the name 'coyote'? They have people tied up, put in the back of trucks and vans. They can't go through checkpoints. They have to go through open areas. Can't walk through. You can't go through it. Because even if they don't do much of an inspection of your truck or your car, they do open the back door, or they do look through a window. You can't have women sitting there that are tied up. So when I hear the other side say , and we have some of the other side here. But when I hear the other side say, 'Oh, no, everything goes through the checkpoint,' that's absolutely false. You have areas where you literally have roads that are carved in the sand that it's used so much. They go right through these roads. They go right, they hang a left and hang another left, and 'Welcome to the United States.' There's nobody there to even talk to them. Because you're talking about 2,000 miles. You're talking about a lot of area. So we're doing really well on the wall , the emergency you've all been reading. We do have an emergency. We have an emergency of people pouring into our country that we don't want , criminals, smugglers. We have drugs pouring into our country. We can't have it. We can't have it. We cannot allow this to happy to our country. Most drugs , most of the major drugs are coming through the southern border. This will make it , you're never going to stop it completely, but we can stop it a lot. One of the things that Ambassador Lighthizer and Steve, and all of the people that are working with China , the fentanyl is a tremendous problem. It seems to be made 100 percent in China. A hundred percent. Now, China is paying us, right now, billions and billions of dollars of tariffs a month. Every month, billions of dollars. I love it. Personally, I love it. But they're paying billions of dollars. And it's hurting them; it's not good for them. And I said to President Xi , I said, 'President, you have to do me a favor. As part of our trade deal ' , it has nothing to do with trade, or certainly very little , but we're having shipped over here, from China, fentanyl. It's killing 88,000 people a year, and probably more. That's just the ones we know about. It's deadly. A little tiny spoonful can wipe out a state, it's hard to believe. It can wipe out an entire state, a spoonful of this stuff. And in China, they have a very, very tough penalty for drugs. It's called the death penalty. And I said to President Xi, 'You don't have much of a drug problem. Do you have a drug problem?' 'No. No drug problem.' I said, 'So you have 1.4 billion people, and you don't have a drug problem?' 'That's right. No drug problem.' I said, 'What do you attribute that to?' 'Death penalty. Quick trial.' They don't have trials that last 19 years. At the end of a , the judge dies. Everybody dies. The only one living is the one that did the damage. No, they have what's called a 'quick trial.' It goes quick. It doesn't take a lot of time. And if you're a drug dealer, you'll say, 'You know what , maybe I'll just sort of stay out of China.' Singapore, the same thing. So I said to President Xi , I said, 'You know, if you would criminalize the sale of fentanyl into the United States, you would be saving many, many lives.' It took me one minute, and he agreed. Because it's not criminalized. I think they view it as an industrial drug or something. It's not criminalized. And as part of our deal , and, Bob, don't forget to put that down , but as part of our deal, I think we're going to get a criminalization of fentanyl being sold into the United States. It'll stop. (Applause.) It'll stop. Very important. And I have to tell you, I have to really thank President Xi, both for that, and he has been a big help with respect to North Korea. I have a very, very good relationship with Kim Jong Un. Very, very good. But we need all the help we can get. And as you know, about 92 percent of the goods going into North Korea go through China. And President Xi has been very good. He's been very, very good. Now, you know, it helps that we are in a strong trading position. But nevertheless, he's been very strong and he's, for the most part, held it. At the beginning, he was perfect. I told him the other day, 'At the beginning, you were perfect. Now you're good. Not quite as good. You got to get better.' But maybe we'll make a deal and then we won't have to worry about that any longer. So that will be something really great. But he's been great. And the fentanyl is , they're already working on that process. And, you know, I said, 'Do you need any other approvals?' 'No.' I said, 'Well, that works a lot different than this country.' (Laughter.) He needs no other approval. When I got the basketball players out , the three basketball players , that was a beautiful scene. I was in China. And you have these three, you know, potential stars , and I guess they're going into the NBA draft, or just have , but I said, 'Would you do me a favor? Three players were just arrested.' They were arrested for stealing , in Louis Vuitton , sunglasses. And I wasn't happy with those three players because they never gave our country much credit for having gotten them out. And believe me, they'd be in jail. Stealing in a store in China is a very big offense. And I said, 'Would you do me a favor?' I was having dinner with him at this incredible show that he put on in a ballroom, the likes of which few people have ever seen. It was an incredible evening. Melania is here. And I'm talking. And it just happened and they were arrested. They were put in jail. And I said, 'Mr. President, could you do me a favor? Could you let the three basketball players out?' He didn't know about it. He called over to his people. He's got 10 people standing behind him; every one is a central casting. Central casting. (Laughter.) Glasses, pad , boom. He went over , he came back. He reported within two minutes, explained, 'Basketball players ' Bom. Bom. And I said, 'It would be a great thing if you could possibly let them out.' He goes, 'So be it. They're out.' I thought , I said, 'Is this different than our country?' Huh? (Laughter.) It's just a little bit different. And we got them out. Then we came back, and the one father said, 'Well, we don't know that Trump helped. I sent a consultant.' That consultant would've gotten nowhere. But, you know, we just have a great relationship with so many of these countries. And I think in some cases it's tough. There are many countries that take advantage of us very seriously, both at NATO and on trade. The European Union is very, very tough. Very, very tough. They don't allow our products in. They don't allow our farming goods in. You people know. Many of you represent farm states. They won't , you know that better than anybody. They won't allow our farm products in. They don't take any. They have these non-, you know, monetary barriers that are brutal. They're worse than the , you know, than others. The cars , they charge us big tariffs. And it's very hard for a car to get in, number one. But if it does, they have to pay a big tariff, whereas we charge them almost nothing when they send their cars to us , Mercedes and BMW, and all of the things that they send. So we're taking care of it. I mean, we've informed them that, 'Look, if you don't , if you're not going play ball ' President Obama, in eight years, couldn't do a thing. They wouldn't even meet with him. They said, 'We have no intention of meeting.' They wouldn't even meet with President Obama. They wouldn't meet with President Bush. EU is one of the toughest , maybe the toughest. Maybe, in certain ways, tougher than China, just smaller, from our standpoint. But they have to meet. And we told them, 'Have to meet. Sorry. And if you don't meet, we're going to tariff the hell out of you.' And they're going to meet. I mean, they're going to meet. But we lost last year with the European Union $151 billion. This has been going on for many years. Think of it , $151 billion. We take their product; they don't take ours. We don't charge them tariffs; they charge us tariffs. Other than that, it's a very fair arrangement. And, by the way, we pay for their military. Because we pay almost, getting close to 100 percent for their military. I've gotten them to put up over $100 billion toward NATO, which has made a big impact. But , so they have to treat us fairly. We want to have a great relationship. I have a great relationship with the leaders. But we have to be treated fairly. So, overall, we're doing a great job for our country. Our country has rarely done better. Maybe never done better from an economy standpoint. We're very proud of it. And we have tremendous potential when we fix these trade deals, because we're being ripped by everybody. We are just being ripped, because we lose $800 billion a year on trade. Think of it. It's incon- , $800 billion. Nobody even knows what that means. And we're fixing that all up. We start with Mexico, Canada, China. China is the big one. China is 50 percent of the number , even more. And we're doing very well. That could happen fairly soon, or it might not happen at all. Okay? Might not happen at all, but I think it's going to happen and it could happen fairly soon. The relationship is great. So I just want to thank all of the governors for being here. You're very special people. I think we have 17 brand-new governors. Right? Brand new ones. Very smart ones, like my friend. Huh? Congratulations. It's a great , you're going to have , you have such an easy state. (Laughter.) That's so easy. Great state of Illinois. What an easy state. I don't know. Huh? Have you found it to be easier or tougher than you thought? I'll help you out. I help everybody out. I'm going to help you. Congratulations. It's an honor to have you all at the White House. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)"}
{"SpeechID":"VSDT432019520","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2019-03-04","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump to the National Association of Attorneys General","Type":"speech","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) Please. Thank you very much. I'm very honored to welcome our State Attorneys General back to the White House. We were together last year, and I said, \"I'm inviting you back.\" And a lot things have been done, a lot of progress has been made. And, Vice President, thank you very much for being here. You were here last year and we're here again, Mike. Let me begin by saying our hearts go out to everyone affected by the devastating storms in Alabama, Georgia, and the surrounding states, and especially to the families of those who have tragically lost their lives. I've spoken with Governor Ivey, and we're working closely with officials throughout the region to get our communities back on their feet. Attorney General Marshall and Attorney General Carr, when you get home, please tell the people of the great states of Alabama and Georgia that America has their backs. We have a call in to Brian Kemp, and we let them know and , the Governor and everybody , that we're with you 100 percent. Thank you very much. One hundred percent, we'll be there. Thank you. I want to thank your National Association President, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry , a friend of mine. We're also grateful to be joined by our fantastic new Attorney General, Bill Barr. Bill, thank you. Today, we join together to reaffirm and strengthen the vital partnership among state, local, and federal law enforcement. Only by working together can we ensure security for every community and deliver justice for every citizen. I want to take a moment to send a message this afternoon, on behalf of everyone in this room, to all law enforcement personnel across America: You are loved, you are cherished and respected by the American people more than you will ever know. So true. More than you will ever know. When I took office two years ago, one of my highest priorities was to reduce violent crime. In the two years before my inauguration, violent crime was up substantially , very substantially , and murders had increased by more than 20 percent. For this reason, my administration resurrected Project Safe Neighborhoods , bringing together citizens groups, sheriffs, and police departments to put dangerous offenders behind bars, while supporting crime prevention and reentry programs. Part of the reason we're doing well is that people are getting jobs because the economy may be the strongest it's ever been. I mean, all of your states are doing very well. I think we have the strongest economy, perhaps, ever. The lowest unemployment rate we've ever had , you could say \"51 years\" or you could say \"ever.\" But groups , if you look at African American, Asian American, Hispanic American , the lowest unemployment rate, historically, ever. So that helps a lot with what you do. We deployed 200 new violent crime prosecutors. We charged a record number of firearms offenders. And last year, we prosecuted the most violent criminals ever. The most ever in our history, also. With your help and leadership, violent crime is now going down for the first time in a long time. Murders in America's largest cities dropped by 7 percent between 2016 and 2017. Last year, we passed historic legislation to combat the devastating opioid and drug crisis. And I'm dealing with China right now on a very big trade deal, as you probably have read, heard. Some of you are a little bit involved. But I can tell you, I said to President Xi that we cannot let fentanyl into our country. Almost 100 percent comes from China. It's devastating. As you know, better than I do, it's devastating. And he has promised to , and they're in the process of doing , so when I take him for his word , make it a criminal act at the highest level, which, in China, means the death penalty. That should have a massive impact on fentanyl coming into our country from China. This legislation expands lifesaving treatment and authorizes funding for local law enforcement to help those badly addicted get the treatment they need. Our State Attorneys General are launching bold initiatives to fight this epidemic. In Arkansas, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge , thank you. Where is Leslie? Thank you. Thank you, Leslie, very much. Great job you're doing too. Has taken on the drug companies, launched a groundbreaking education program and trained local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the opioid epidemic. So, Leslie, I want to thank you very much. Everyone is talking about it. Great job. But to defeat this deadly epidemic, America's southern border must be urgently and very strongly secured. We fight wars 6,000 miles away, we spend billions and billions of dollars, but we don't control our own border. Drug trafficking and human traffickers exploit our porous border to finance their ruthless operations across our hemisphere. One in three migrant women is sexually assaulted on the very dangerous journey north. Criminal cartels terrorize innocent people on both sides of the border. Thousands of our citizens are killed by lethal narcotics , 88,000 people, just with certain types of drugs , most of which come through the southern border. Eighty-eight thousand people die and that's just a small portion of it. Hardworking people of every background pay the price for a lack of border control and security. In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults , and these are new numbers, hard to believe , 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 murders. Every day, our brave ICE officers are on the front lines protecting our communities. We must always support the heroes of law enforcement, and we all support law enforcement in every way. Sanctuary cities that release known criminal aliens put all Americans at risk. I urge everyone here today to make sure that your states and cities are fully cooperating with the Department of Homeland Security in their lifesaving mission. We all share the same righteous goal: to build a future where every American , both immigrant and U.S.-born , can thrive in safety, dignity, harmony, and peace. Before Christmas, I was proud to sign historic, bipartisan criminal justice reform into law. And I want to thank the National Association of Attorneys General for everything you did to help pass this FIRST STEP Act. And a special thanks to Attorney General Karl Racine. Where's Karl? Karl? Karl? Karl? Hi, Karl. Great job. Thank you very much. You were very helpful. Everybody said \"Karl.\" I feel like you're , like I know you. (Laughter.) That's pretty good. STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL RACINE: I feel like I know you as well, Mr. President. (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: Karl is , really was fantastic, from the District of Columbia. Attorney General Josh Stein. Josh, thank you very much. Thank you, Josh. Josh, Josh. Stand up, Josh. Go ahead. Come on. That's great. From a great place , from North Carolina. And Attorney General, my friend Ken Paxton, from Texas. Thanks, Ken. Thanks. Great. Great job. Together, we're making our communities safer, our future brighter, and our people more prosperous than ever before. This is what our state and federal partnership is all about: putting the American Dream within reach of all of our citizens. And that's happening more and more, and we're very proud of it. Thank you all for your friendship and your partnership and leadership. Extraordinary leadership, really. Thank you all for the incredible service to your states, your citizens, and your nation. You are very special people and doing a very special and important job. And everybody very much appreciates it, and I want to lead that list. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. (Applause.)

(Applause.) Please. Thank you very much. I'm very honored to welcome our State Attorneys General back to the White House. We were together last year, and I said, 'I'm inviting you back.' And a lot things have been done, a lot of progress has been made. And, Vice President, thank you very much for being here. You were here last year and we're here again, Mike. Let me begin by saying our hearts go out to everyone affected by the devastating storms in Alabama, Georgia, and the surrounding states, and especially to the families of those who have tragically lost their lives. I've spoken with Governor Ivey, and we're working closely with officials throughout the region to get our communities back on their feet. Attorney General Marshall and Attorney General Carr, when you get home, please tell the people of the great states of Alabama and Georgia that America has their backs. We have a call in to Brian Kemp, and we let them know and , the Governor and everybody , that we're with you 100 percent. Thank you very much. One hundred percent, we'll be there. Thank you. I want to thank your National Association President, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry , a friend of mine. We're also grateful to be joined by our fantastic new Attorney General, Bill Barr. Bill, thank you. Today, we join together to reaffirm and strengthen the vital partnership among state, local, and federal law enforcement. Only by working together can we ensure security for every community and deliver justice for every citizen. I want to take a moment to send a message this afternoon, on behalf of everyone in this room, to all law enforcement personnel across America: You are loved, you are cherished and respected by the American people more than you will ever know. So true. More than you will ever know. When I took office two years ago, one of my highest priorities was to reduce violent crime. In the two years before my inauguration, violent crime was up substantially , very substantially , and murders had increased by more than 20 percent. For this reason, my administration resurrected Project Safe Neighborhoods , bringing together citizens groups, sheriffs, and police departments to put dangerous offenders behind bars, while supporting crime prevention and reentry programs. Part of the reason we're doing well is that people are getting jobs because the economy may be the strongest it's ever been. I mean, all of your states are doing very well. I think we have the strongest economy, perhaps, ever. The lowest unemployment rate we've ever had , you could say '51 years' or you could say 'ever.' But groups , if you look at African American, Asian American, Hispanic American , the lowest unemployment rate, historically, ever. So that helps a lot with what you do. We deployed 200 new violent crime prosecutors. We charged a record number of firearms offenders. And last year, we prosecuted the most violent criminals ever. The most ever in our history, also. With your help and leadership, violent crime is now going down for the first time in a long time. Murders in America's largest cities dropped by 7 percent between 2016 and 2017. Last year, we passed historic legislation to combat the devastating opioid and drug crisis. And I'm dealing with China right now on a very big trade deal, as you probably have read, heard. Some of you are a little bit involved. But I can tell you, I said to President Xi that we cannot let fentanyl into our country. Almost 100 percent comes from China. It's devastating. As you know, better than I do, it's devastating. And he has promised to , and they're in the process of doing , so when I take him for his word , make it a criminal act at the highest level, which, in China, means the death penalty. That should have a massive impact on fentanyl coming into our country from China. This legislation expands lifesaving treatment and authorizes funding for local law enforcement to help those badly addicted get the treatment they need. Our State Attorneys General are launching bold initiatives to fight this epidemic. In Arkansas, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge , thank you. Where is Leslie? Thank you. Thank you, Leslie, very much.

(Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Well, you better love me; I kept this place open, that I can tell you. (Applause.) They said, \"We're closing it.\" And I said, \"No, we're not.\" And now you're doing record business. The job you do is incredible. And I'm thrilled to be here in Ohio with the hardworking men and women of Lima. (Applause.) And this is some tank plant. There's nothing like it in the world. You make the finest equipment in the world. You really know what you're doing. They just gave me a little briefing on a couple of those tanks. I want to get into them but then I remember when a man named Dukakis got into a tank. (Laughter.) And I remember him; he tanked when he got into the tank. (Laughter.) He tanked , I never saw anybody tank like that. So I said, maybe I'll , but I'm a little bigger than him; I think it probably would work out okay. How would I look in a tank? Okay? (Applause.) Yeah, not bad. (Applause.) Not bad. The helmet was bigger than he was. That was not good. (Laughter.) We're here today to celebrate a resounding victory for all of you, for northwest Ohio, and for our great military, and for our entire country. Incredible victory. (Applause.) After so many years of budget cuts and layoffs, today, jobs are coming back and pouring back, frankly, like never before. Companies are coming back into our country; they want the action. Production is ramping up in the biggest way. And the awesome M1 Abrams tank is once again thundering down the assembly line. (Applause.) A-1. I want to thank Acting Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan. He's done an incredible job. In fact, ISIS , let me tell you about ISIS. They're not doing so well. You know, we took over the caliphate. You'll see it tonight. When I came in, it was a mess. Where the hell is that chart? (Laughter.) Folks, they gave me all economic charts. They didn't give me the ISIS chart. But if you did , bring it up if anybody has it. Bring it up. When I took over, it was a mess. They were all over the place. All over the , all over Syria and Iraq. And you'd see it was a sea of red. And now you look at it and there's no red. No red. And you look at some of the economic numbers; nobody thought we'd ever see numbers like that in our country , not a for a long time, not for ever. And what we're doing has been incredible. What you're doing has been more incredible. You stuck it out and now you've got one of the most successful military plants anywhere in the world. It's great. (Applause.) So thank you very much, Pat Shanahan. Also thank you to the Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper. He's been fantastic. Thank you. Oh, good. Better late than never. (Laughter.) Here's the story: So, you know, I don't want to have them make a big chart because it costs too much. You know, I'm a business guy. They said, \"Sir, we could make a big chart.\" I said, \"How much does it cost?\" Like it matters. But it matters to me. Does that make sense to you? AUDIENCE: Yeah! THE PRESIDENT: So, two maps, identical , except the one on top was Syria. See that? The one on top was Syria in November of '16. You remember that date? November of '16. November 8th. We had a little victory that night. (Applause.) We had a little victory. But a lot of us weren't surprised by it, but the other side said, \"Where did all of those people come from?\" (Laughter.) And I said, \"They just didn't like candidates for a lot of years. They didn't vote.\" So what happens is , this is all ISIS. Now, on the bottom , that's as of today , this is ISIS. There's none. The caliphate is gone, as of tonight. (Applause.) Pretty good. That's pretty good, right? We took over a mess. We took over a mess with North Korea. We took over a mess in the Middle East. We took over. A lot of bad things were happening and the economy was not doing well. It was heading in the wrong direction. You remember that. It was going to go bad, and then we opened up with the regulation cuts and all of the other things we've done, including the big tax cut. (Applause.) But it made a big difference. Made a big difference. And we'll show you some numbers in a little while. I want to also thank Major General Brian Cummings for the incredible leadership and service you have done. An unbelievable job. Thank you, Brian. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) We're also honored to be joined by several of the Ohio leaders, friends of mine , terrific people: Senator Rob Portman. Rob, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Rob. A man who I will never, I promise, wrestle. He was one of the best wrestlers in the history of college wrestling. His record is so ridiculously good. I said, \"Were you as good as Dan Gable?\" He said, \"No.\" See, if it were me, I would've said, \"Yes, I was much better.\" (Laughter.) You know who Dan Gable is. Jim Jordan, a great guy. (Applause.) And a great champion. A great, great athlete. Great champion. Thank you. He is tough. You'll want to have him on your side. Another one you want on your side always is Mike Turner. Mike, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Mike. Great. Warren Davidson. Warren, thank you. (Applause.) And, Bob Latta, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Warren and Bob. (Applause.) And a man who we're very proud of because, along with Mike, he ran a great race: Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted. He ran a great race for Governor. (Applause.) We came in that final day , they were a little bit down, against a tough opponent, who I was not a big fan of, and I didn't like the people that were supporting him too much , Pocahontas and others. (Laughter.) And I came that final day, and we had a day that was incredible and they won by , what did you win by? Six or seven points, right? It was an incredible , huh? Even higher. That's pretty good. Good. I'll see Mike in a little while. That's great. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Proud of you. To our plant leaders, Lieutenant Colonel Travis Adkins and Henry Kennedy , (applause) , we appreciate everything you do to keep the Army \"Rolling Along\" full speed ahead. (Applause.) Incredible job. We're grateful to General Dynamics , incredible company , Phebe Novakovic. How did I do with that one? Novak-ovic. It's a little tricky, but that's okay. What a job you do. Thank you. Great job. Thank you for the tour, too. (Applause.) And the hardworking members of the United Auto Workers. (Applause.) Now, you've got to get over to a place that I like a lot, Lordstown. And you've got to get that. You know, the only place , General , what's going on with General Motors? We have the best economy we've ever had. We have the lowest employment , unemployment that we've had in 51 years; soon will be the record of all time. And what's going on with General Motors? Get that plant open or sell it to somebody and they'll open it. Everybody wants it. Sell it to somebody or open it yourselves. Get it going now and the UAW will help you. (Applause.) The UAW , you're going to help. The UAW just promised they're going to help. Get it open now. Don't wait. They said they have discussions coming up in September, October. I said, why not tomorrow? Why not on Monday? What do you have to wait months for? Get the discussions going. Get it open. Lordstown is a great area. I guess I like it because I won so big there. (Laughter.) But we're doing a job, and this state has been , we're very proud of what's happened in Ohio under our federal auspices. We've gotten so many things done, and this plant is one of our great achievements. To all of our active-duty service members and our wonderful veterans, thank you for serving your country , (applause) , with such tremendous distinction and honor. And to every welder, and machinist, and assembler, and mechanic, and engineer, and electrician, and carpenter, and every patriot here at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center: Thank you for pouring out your heart and your sweat and your soul to help restore the might of the American military, which very soon will be stronger than it ever was. We've bought billions and billions of dollars' worth of new planes and tanks and many other things. So, thank you all. Great job. (Applause.) And the fact is we have the best tanks driven by the best soldiers, made by the best workers anywhere in the world. And that's true. A lot of people are asking, because they love me, and they ask me about a man named John McCain. And if you want, I could tell you about , should I or not? Yes? Yes? AUDIENCE: Yes! THE PRESIDENT: So, I have to be honest: I've never liked him much. Hasn't been for me. I've really , probably never will. But there are certain reasons for it, and I'll tell you. And I do this to save a little time with the press later on. John McCain received a fake and phony dossier. Did you hear about the dossier? It was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton. Right? AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: And John McCain got it. He got it. And what did he do? He didn't call me. He turned it over to the FBI, hoping to put me in jeopardy. And that's not the nicest thing to do. You know, when those people say , because I'm a very loyal person. John McCain campaigned for years to repeal and replace Obamacare , for years, in Arizona. A great state. I love the people of Arizona. But he campaigned, for years, for \"repeal and replace.\" So did Rob and so did a lot of senators. When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against \"repeal and replace.\" He voted against, at 2 o'clock in the morning. Remember \"thumbs down\"? We said, \"What the hell happened?\" He said, two hours before, he was voting to repeal and replace. And then he went thumbs down, badly hurting the Republican Party, badly hurting our nation, and hurting many sick people who desperately wanted good, affordable healthcare. We would've had it. This would've saved our country over a trillion dollars in entitlements, and we would have ended up making a great healthcare plan, frankly, with the Democrats because they would have had no choice. McCain didn't get the job done for our great vets and the VA, and they knew it. That's why, when I had my dispute with him, I had such incredible support from the vets and from the military. The vets were on my side because I got the job done. I got Choice and I got Accountability. Accountability , meaning, if somebody mistreats our vets , for 45 years they were trying , they mistreat our vets, and we say, \"Hey, you're fired. Get out.\" You can't mistreat our vets. They never got it done. (Applause.) And Choice , for year and years, decades, they wanted to get Choice. You know what Choice is. You're a military person. You're one of our great people. To me, one of the great people. For many decades, they couldn't get it done. It was never done. I got it five months ago. I got it done , Choice. Instead of waiting in line , a vet fought for us, fought in these tanks; fought for us. Instead of waiting in line for two days, two weeks, two months , people on line, they're not very sick. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill. We gave them Choice. If you have to wait for any extended period of time, you go outside, you go to a local doctor. We pay the bill; you get yourself better. Go home to your family. And we got it passed. We got it done. And the other thing is we're in a war in the Middle East that McCain pushed so hard. He was calling Bush , President Bush , all the time: \"Get into the Middle East. Get into the Middle East.\" So now we're into that war for $7 trillion. Thousands and thousands of our people have been killed, millions of people overall. And frankly, we're straightening it out now, but it's been a disaster for our country. We've spent tremendous wealth , tremendous wealth , and tremendous lives in that war. And what do we have? It's worse than it was 19 years ago. I call them the \"endless wars.\" Nineteen years ago, when we started. So, John McCain loved it. I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted , which, as President, I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get \"thank you.\" That's okay. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain. So now, what we could say is: Now we're all set. I don't think I have to answer that question, but the press keeps, \"What do you think of McCain? What do you think?\" Not my kind of guy. But some people like him, and I think that's great. Now let's get back and let's get on to the subject of tanks and this economy. Because you know what? We love what we are and what we do more than anything else. We build great, we fight great, and we're right now in Lima, and Lima is an incredible place, a place of strength and dedication. Since 1941, this plant has built and serviced thousands of tanks and military vehicles that powered American forces through World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Iraq, and Afghanistan. And the tanks are the best in the world , better than ever before. Every single Abrams tank in existence , the steel and the aluminum warhorse; they're really a warhorse of American ground forces , it was built or serviced on these very grounds by you people. By you people. But under the previous administration, this tank factory , the last of its kind anywhere in the Western Hemisphere , came very close to shutting down. Four straight years, the number of U.S. tanks that were budgeted for upgrades was zero. Does anybody remember that? Raise your hands. Do you remember that? Zero. That was under your great President Obama. Our military readiness declined and your workforce was slashed by 60 percent. But those days are over. We are rebuilding the American military. We are restoring American manufacturing. And we are once again fighting for our great American workers. Over the last two years, we have secured nearly $1.5 trillion to provide our warfighters the finest aircraft, ships, missiles, and tanks anywhere on Earth. We make the best equipment on Earth. And we sell that equipment, as you know, to good allies. Although, sometimes the good ones turn out to be not so good, and then we do something. We figure it out. You know what you have to do? You figure it out. This year, we're asking for an additional $750 billion, which is a record. That includes funding to upgrade more than 160 mighty M1 Abrams tanks. Congratulations. (Applause.) Congratulations. These historic investments are making America safer and our workforce stronger. From the awe-inspiring F-35 fighter in Texas to the Ford-class aircraft carriers in Virginia , we're now building the largest aircraft carrier anywhere in the world. In fact, I'm hearing it's actually the largest ship ever built. It is seriously big. I was there recently. It's something , it's like landing at an airport, although you have to be very talented, still, to land on those decks, no matter how you figure it. Some people can do it and some people can't. Some very good pilots can. To advance missile defense systems in Alabama, American workers are building the most cutting-edge, modern, and powerful military anywhere on the planet. At the heart of our military rebuilding is our investment in the legendary M1 Abrams tank. And I will tell you, the investment has paid off because the technology is so , if you look at this tank from now, and you go back 10 years and look at the tank, it's a like a whole different , it's a whole different deal, isn't it? A whole different deal. Over the next three years, we're investing more than $6 billion in upgrades and modifications to these tanks , that's going to keep you very busy here , almost twice the amount spent in the entire eight years of the previous administration, which was going down to nothing. Because you were closed; this place was closed. And I heard about it. And I got calls from Jim Jordan and Rob, and everybody, saying, \"You just can't do this.\" And after I studied the situation, I said, \"We're not only not going to close in Lima, we're going to expand.\" And that's what took place. So you owe a lot to a lot of your great political leaders. Our investment , (applause) , our investment in you is also a tremendous win for American taxpayers. By modernizing this plant and accelerating production, we will bring the cost down by 20 percent, saving taxpayers nearly $3 million on every single tank. That's not bad. With the help of everyone in this room, we are giving our warriors the most effective, reliable, and lethal battle tank in the history of war. Would you say that's correct? (Applause.) So how does this compare with the tanks made in China and Russia and other places? What do you think? Can we take them? (Applause.) They say it's much better. America does not need conflict. But if conflict comes, and you know the story , you've got to be strong if conflict comes , we will dominate the battlefield, and we will win, win, win. We're now set up to win, win, win. When I came in, we had some big problems. You look at what we've done on so many fronts. And we actually have better relationships. They respect our country more than they've ever respected it. Our country is respected again. The United States is respected again. (Applause.) To help meet our military needs, I am very proud to report that 400 new jobs are coming here to Lima, compared to just a few years ago, and we're doubling the size of your workforce. (Applause.) We need to. Our investment will also support thousands of additional jobs across our nation to assemble these incredible Abrams tanks. The engines are from Alabama, transmissions are from Indiana, special armor from Idaho, and the 120-millimeter gun , and the gun parts from upstate New York and from Pennsylvania. All great places. In Ohio alone, almost 200 suppliers churn out parts and materials that go into every tank that rolls off this factory's floor. Incredible. What you achieve here at this plant is truly remarkable. And equally remarkable is that they wanted to close it. No good. Every day you start with a powerful, heavy, but sometimes rust-covered, hollowed-out hull , and with incredible skill and extraordinary care , you restore its unmatched power, strength, and glory with all brand new equipment inside. The best in the world. The amazing restorations you accomplish every day are a perfect symbol for what we're doing with American manufacturing all across our nation. And we just came out , another chart , we just came out with numbers , the Economic Report of the President: 3.1 percent GDP. The first time in 14 years that we cracked 3, right? (Applause.) That's pretty good , 3.1. The press tried to make it 2.9. I said, \"It's not 2.9.\" What they did is they took odd months. I said, \"No, no, no. You go from January to December. You don't take certain months and add them up.\" Because I said, \"We're going to break 3.\" And we did. We did 3.1. The fake news tried to change it but we caught them. (Laughter.) I said , I said, \"You know, we didn't break the 3. Oh, that's terrible.\" They said, \"Yes, sir, you did. They just took odd months.\" I said, \"No, no, January to December.\" 3.1 percent, first time in 14 years. Congratulations. (Applause.) Sort of incredible. It's true. This chart is a beauty. This is \"Venture Capital Deals Surged Following the Passage of\" , really, the election , rising nearly $17 billion. You know what that means. So here's your charts , going along , and here's us. See the red line there? It's like a rocket ship. (Applause.) Can you see that? It's small but cheap , (laughter) , and it gets the point across, right? A couple of other things , because I think this report is incredible. So these are \"Workers Coming Off the Sidelines,\" and now it's just , this is just partially. So, the blue. The blue. The red. That's a big difference. That's a tremendous difference. The most in many, many years. And everyone said, \"You couldn't do it, couldn't bring back manufacturing jobs.\" Remember? \"You'd need a magic wand.\" We're bringing them back beyond anybody's expectations. You see the red line here? These are \"Wages are Rising for the Workers.\" These are \"Wages are Rising.\" (Applause.) 3.4 percent , it's one of the largest increases in 20 years. And for the most part, they were going down. They weren't even rising. I used to campaign , I'd be in Ohio, I'd be in Pennsylvania, I'd be all over, and I'd talk about wages where people would have to work three jobs and they were making less than they did 20 years ago. You remember that, Rob? Jim? I used to do it all the time. I'd be , it was just a part of my speech. I'd say, \"You're working three jobs. You make less money than you did 20 years ago.\" And it was literally 21 years. And now wages are going up. And you have something else that's happening. If you don't like working here , and you all do , and I don't want to lose anybody. And who the hell would want to leave this place? This is what you call a great , a great place to work. (Applause.) But if for any reason , if for any reason you did, you can pick out six, seven, eight other jobs. In other words, you can finally have a job that you really like, where you like getting up in the morning. I do. I do, even though I have the fake news hounding me all the time. (Applause.) The fake and phony and corrupt. It's fake. It's corrupt. But we got to live with it, right? Got to live with it. But you guys , you do; you get up in the morning, you love to come, and you love your job, or you wouldn't be doing what I just witnessed back there when I looked at some of these incredible tanks. And here's another chart: \"Deregulating and Saving\" , through the roof. Here's a chart: \"The American Energy.\" The United States is the largest producer , that's happened over the last short period of time , of crude oil and natural gas in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia. We're also a net , do you think Russia is happy about this? I don't think so. You know, Hillary wanted to put windmills all over the place. Let's put up some windmills. \"When the wind doesn't blow, just turn off the television, darling, please.\" (Laughter.) \"No wind out today. There's no wind. Please turn off the television, quickly.\" (Laughter.) Put the windmills up and watch the value of your house , if you're in sight of a windmill, watch the value of your house go down by 65 percent. Wonderful to have windmills. And solar is wonderful too, but it's not strong enough and it's very, very expensive. So the United States is now the largest producer of crude oil and natural gas in the world. Happened all in that very short , you know, you guys are all so , (applause) , think of that. Think of that, beating out Saudi Arabia and Russia. They're pretty good producers, right? Guess what? We do more than they do. And in a short period of time, as soon as we get some pipelines opened in Texas, we'll be able to almost double it. Double it. What we're doing is incredible. We approved the Keystone Pipeline. Right? I did that. Forty-eight thousand jobs between that and the Dakota Access Pipeline. I got them approved, like almost my first couple of days in office. I said, \"They're approved.\" And what is it? It's good environmentally. It's underground. You're not riding it over tracks. You're not trucking it. It's actually a great thing, environmentally. But President Obama, after years and years and years, they said, \"We're not going to approve it.\" I said, \"We'll approve it.\" Forty-eight thousand jobs. Think of it. It's being built right now. They're both being built. One just got completed , Dakota Access. And many, many other cases like that. Plants all over the country are going up. But the thing that's the greatest is companies that left us , they no longer wanted to be in the USA , they're coming roaring back. Toyota , $13.5 billion. We've created more than almost 6 million jobs since the election. And if I would have said that to the fake news during the campaign, they would've said, \"He exaggerates.\" I'm not exaggerating, but nobody would've believed that could happen. Including almost 600,000 manufacturing jobs. We could've taken your jobs, all. If it weren't for me, this place would've been closed. Would have been closed. (Applause.) Would have been closed, fellas. And you're doing us a favor because of the great job you do. It's not just a one-way street. You're doing us a favor. Last year, our manufacturers reported the highest level of optimism ever recorded in a 40-year-old poll. And this year we went up again. Went from 56 percent , and it stayed there for years, between 50 and 56 , to 94 percent. They've never had anything like it. That's optimism. (Applause.) And we , all of us , are living by two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. (Applause.) Very simple. Unemployment has recently reached the lowest rate in 51 years. Other than that, we're not doing well. (Laughter.) More , and think of this: More Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country. Almost 160 million people. More than ever before, by far. And if you look at African American , you've heard me say this many times , African American employment is at an all-time low , unemployment. Asian American unemployment is at an all-time low. Hispanic unemployment , an all-time low. Women's unemployment , 65-year low. Soon it'll be historic, meaning better than ever. And soon the basic number will be historic. We've reduced the number of unemployed veterans by nearly 50 percent. I'm so proud of that. That's why the veterans like me more than other people. (Applause.) That's why they like me. (Applause.) Fifty percent since the election. And veteran unemployment is now at the lowest level ever, ever, ever recorded. Thanks to our pro-American tax, regulatory, and trade policies , and, by the way, we're doing great in our deal with China. They were taking out 500 billion a year for many years from our country. I consider that we've rebuilt China. Five hundred billion, not million. Think of what that means. Five-hundred billion dollars a year taken out of our country. And now they're paying us. They're paying tariffs on the products they're sending in, and we're negotiating and they want to make a deal. And hopefully, we'll make a deal. And if we don't, that's fine. And if we do, that's fine. It's got to be a good deal. It can't be a bad deal. We're so far down, it's got to be a great deal. If it's not a great deal, we'll never catch up. And their economy is way down. And I don't want their economy to be down; I want their economy to be up. But their economy is down 32 to 38 percent. And our economy, if you look at the numbers, since my election, is up almost 50 percent. Fifty. That's some difference. (Applause.) And the world economy , the world economy is not good. And frankly, if the world economy were good, that would be, in a way, good for us. So we're fighting there. We're bucking. Europe is down, Asia is down , a lot of places. Almost every place is down. Except the United States is up. And we're way up. And just think of what that would be. The world goes up; we go up with the world. The world is down, but we still go up. Something is happening. That wouldn't happen under Barack Obama, that I can tell you. It wouldn't happen under Crooked Hillary Clinton. (Laughter.) Last week, as I said, Toyota announced a massive investment. They're going to be expanding factories all across our nation. And they're going to be soon building new ones. Ford is bringing hundreds of new jobs to Chicago and other places. Tremendous amount of car companies are coming into the great state of Michigan, and they're coming into the great state of Ohio. Volkswagen is creating 1,000 brand new jobs in the state of Tennessee. And Chrysler is building Detroit's first new car factory in a generation , so long ago , in a generation. (Applause.) Think of that. Michigan. Michigan. You know, the nice part about running for President this time, as opposed to last time , last time, you know, I said I was going to do it, but I didn't do it. But I said I was going to do it. This time, I've done it far greater than I said I was going to do it. So it's going to be really easy on the debate stage when they hit me with nonsense and I say, \"Really? But African American unemployment , the best it's ever been.\" Hispanic, Asian, women, everybody , it's all the best it's ever been. How do you top that in a debate? What are they going to say? \"Uh, well, it could be better\"? (Laughter.) No, the easy part , and I say this to all of your political leaders here , if you do a good job, it's a lot easier that second time. But nobody has done the job that we've done. And I say \"we\" because you've been on our side. Your union leaders aren't on my side, by the way. I watched them on television. They're not. But the unions , the people that work there are on our side. It's true. (Applause.) It's true. I had , AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump! THE PRESIDENT: I had union leaders in the White House a few months ago , the biggest guys. Nice guys, but they're Democrats no matter what. Okay? And you see where that's taken you. That would've been catastrophic. But I had them in, and we explained how good it was for the car industry, for this, for that. They said, \"Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, this is unbelievable. Thank you, sir.\" But then I see one of the guys the next day on a television show. The , I think it was called \"Deface the Nation.\" (Laughter.) And , ladies and gentlemen, \"Deface the Nation.\" And he's saying how he's a Democrat and he wants Democrat policies , which were, by the way, putting everybody in the poorhouse. But I just left the guy. He's hugging me, kissing me, telling him what an unbelievable deal. Nobody else could do it. And the next day, he's on there talking about stuff. And I really said, \"I sort of don't want to meet these guys. I want to deal with the people in the union, not the heads of the union.\" (Applause.) Because the heads of the union are not honest people. They're not honest, and they ought to lower your dues, by the way. They ought to stop with the dues. They , you're paying too much dues. (Applause.) As an example, they could've kept General Motors. They could've kept it in that gorgeous plant at Lordstown. They could've kept it. Lower your dues. Lower your dues. America's Founders understood that to be strong and powerful as a nation, we must also be a great manufacturing nation. President Obama said, \"You'll never bring manufacturing back.\" I said, \"What are you talking about?\" It's all about manufacturing. And we're bringing it back in record numbers. (Applause.) Nobody can believe it. And these are talented jobs. These are great jobs. These are genius jobs. And these are really well-paying jobs, as you people know. You get a lot of money. Let's negotiate. (Laughter.) We must not be dependent upon others for the resources we need to protect our people. When we open this plant, a couple of my people , I have some good business people , they said, \"Let's make a deal with the workers before we open it. We'll make a great deal.\" I said, \"I agree we can do that, but we're not going to do that. These people have suffered enough.\" We're going to open the plant and everybody is going to be happy. You understand what I mean by that. That's why my administration is restoring America's defense industrial base by bringing great jobs and great wages to plants just like this in Lima. Economy and strength is security. And it's all about security and national security. It's about loving our country. It's about loving our flag. You know that. (Applause.) Now, as result of my very tough trade actions , something I'm very proud of , America's steel and our steel mills are roaring back to life. You know that. You see it all over. We put a big, fat beautiful tariff on that dumped steel. It's sand steel. It's mud steel. It's crap steel. And they're dumping it all over. I said, \"That's okay, you can dump but we're going to charge you 25 percent when you come in and think you're going to take our jobs and give us bad steel.\" I know a lot about , I've used a lot of steel. Right here in Ohio, Nucor has just announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. (Applause.) Charter Steel announced plans to build a brand new, 150-million-dollar steel plant in Cuyahoga Heights. JSW Steel is restarting the furnace , that's a massive furnace , and investing $500 million in Mingo Junction. And Cleveland Cliffs announced a brand new, 700-million-dollar plant in Toledo, Ohio. (Applause.) Don't leave here, though. Don't leave here. Don't get any ideas. Don't get leave here. Just stay here. Just relax. Stay here. We don't want you going to Mingo Junction. We're also finally fixing the horrible trade deals that have cost our nation trillions of dollars and where we've lost millions and millions and millions of jobs, like we were stupid people. They closed a plant; they move it to Mexico. They make the product; they sell it right in the United States. No tax. All we end up with is loss and no jobs. We get no taxes. We get nothing. That doesn't happen anymore. Under our new deal, there's a tremendous financial disincentive to close up plants and move them to other countries. You're not going to see that anymore. (Applause.) And we're getting rid of the disaster known as NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated in the history of the world. (Applause.) All over the country, you still see empty plants, when they haven't been converted to nursing homes and apartments, right? It's not the same thing as a plant. I love apartments. I love the business. But that's not the same thing as a plant where you have 5,000 people working. Not the same thing. And replacing it , we're replacing NAFTA with the great U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. Like the song. If you can't remember , YMCA, right? We'll play the song for you, everybody. USMCA. We've taken historic action to confront China's trading abuses, because the days of stealing American jobs and our ideas and our wealth have come to an end, folks. They've come to an idea, all right? They've come to an end. (Applause.) We've made some progress. That's why you see these numbers. Look at that chart. Look at that. You don't have to know what's on it. What difference , look at the line. (Laughter.) You don't have to know what the hell is on it. All you know is that's a good line. (Laughter.) Technological positive change. That's okay, right? It's all like that. That's what it is. Rob, Jim, that's what it is. Turner, see that? Look. That's what we fight for, right? Huh? That's what we're all fighting for. In everything we do and every action we take, we're putting America first, and we are putting American workers first, for the first time in a long time. (Applause.) So just in closing, I'd like to now introduce a couple of truly incredible workers from right here , I guess you know these folks , right here at the tank plant to share quickly their stories with you. Adam Stahler is a Quality Engineer who has worked at the plant for 10 years. His son, Derek, is a Specialist with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Hood, Texas. Great Place. Derek operates and maintains Stryker personnel carriers, one of the vehicles produced right here in Lima. Adam, thank you for everything your family has done for our nation. Please come up and say a few words. Adam, thank you. (Applause.) MR. STAHLER: Thank you, Mr. President. It's a pleasure and an honor to be up here today as a representative of the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center. For those of you who don't me, my name is Adam Stahler. I'm a Quality Systems Engineer employed here going on 10 years. Growing up in the area and currently living in Wapakoneta, I have witnessed the highs and lows the economy has had on this facility and the region. I'm proud that this administration recognizes the importance of this facility and the value we provide to the warfighter. It is very rewarding to have a son serving the United States military, where he is stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, working on a quality vehicle produced by my brothers and sisters at JSMC. My son thanks you. And for that, I thank you. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Boy, you're a young guy. How old are you? MR. STAHLER: Forty-five. THE PRESIDENT: Wow. You look like your son. MR. STAHLER: Oh, thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) I thought Adam was the son. Look how young he looks. (Laughter.) He's got a son working out there? Wow. Whatever you're eating, Adam, keep eating it. (Laughter.) It's working. Jay Baldwin is a Boiler Operator and a proud Army veteran. After serving as a tank crewman on the M1, now Jay helps build the M1 right here. You know him. Jay, please come on up. (Applause.) MR. BALDWIN: Thank you, Mr. President, for coming to our plant in Lima, Ohio. As a former Army M1 tanker, I can honestly say that we make the best tank in the entire world. (Applause.) Our workers here are very proud to be making such a fine product for our soldiers to have the benefit and best capabilities on the battlefield. And thanks to our great President, his military and economic policies have rejuvenated this facility to increase production of armored vehicles and hiring of more skilled workers. And finally, it is my personal opinion that God was looking after our country when you were elected. (Applause.) Mr. President, thank you for everything you have done. (Applause.) Thank you, truthfully. THE PRESIDENT: Wow. Thank you. Thank you. That's so nice, Jay and Adam. I appreciate it. You never know what you get when you come up. It's live. (Laughter.) But you couldn't do better than that, right? That's great. Thank you, fellas. That's great. I want to also thank all of the patriots here today. You remind us that the might of America's armed forces also depends upon the skill and devotion of all of America's workers. And you really are doing a job. We're very proud of you. For nearly 80 years, the exceptional workers at this plant has embodied the strength of the American spirit. Those who choose to work here are drawn not just by the promise of a good paycheck but by the power of patriotism , every single one of you is a patriot , the chance to go to work every morning to help protect this nation that we so deeply love. That's why veterans make up more than one third of the workforce at this wonderful plant. We very much stress: We want, wherever we can, we want veterans. That's why you check , (applause) , right? That's right. And that's why you check and recheck every bolt, every single thing having to do with that incredible tank , every pin, every wire, every square inch of each tank before it leaves the floor. And I just got a little news that was given to me as I was walking up. U.S. forces, in the last month, have killed the terrorists responsible for the attack in Syria that killed four Americans, the Paris theater attack in 2015, and the USS Cole bombing in 2000. We killed them all. (Applause.) We killed them all. We killed them all. We killed them all. They're bad people. But that's why you show up early and you stay late, and always get the job done right. You're proud of your work. You do it better than anyone, anywhere in the world , what you do. No country on Earth can match you and no country can match what you do. In just a few months, we will commemorate the 75th anniversary of one of the many victories that workers at the Lima Army Tank Plant helped make possible: the Normandy landings on D-Day, June 6, 1944, in the Second World War. It was right here on these very grounds that thousands of American workers modified M4 Sherman tanks in preparation for a battle that would forever change the course of human history. Right here. (Applause.) The workers who rallied to the Lima plant came from all over northwest Ohio and beyond. They were farmers and refinery workers and shopkeepers and homemakers who rolled up their sleeves and got to work when their country needed them the most. Normandy. Many of them had full-time jobs elsewhere. They punched out at one job, then came here and punched right back in. Not for the money. They knew and fully understood the importance of what they did and what they represented. And if they were lucky, they might catch a few hours' sleep on the loading dock before doing it all again, day after day, day after day. In just three years, the patriots of Ohio cranked out more than 100,000 military vehicles , a truly amazing feat that helped give America the power to vanquish tyranny, defeat our enemies, and save freedom for the entire world. This is the legacy that each of you inherits. And America knows you will carry it forward with the same purpose and passion that you've poured into this factory each and every day. We love you. We see your legacy in every battlefield victory, in the smiling faces of every soldier that returns home safely, and every time a citizen proudly salutes our great American flag. Because it is here in Lima , right here , that American greatness is forged with American hands, with American heart, and with American pride. (Applause.) True. True. We don't know what challenges will come, what dangers we must face, or what opportunities we must seize. But we know that America will always be ready because of you and your strength, and your skill and your drive, and your unbreakable spirit. Because of hardworking citizens like you, the people of Lima, the people of Ohio, and the people of America will always fight on to victory, victory, victory. You don't know how to lose. You never will have to find out. You'll never have to find out about losing. Together, we shall forever be one nation, under God. (Applause.) So I want to thank you. I want to say God bless you, God bless Ohio, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. (Applause.)","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1330337\/remarks-by-president-trump-at-lima-army-tank-plant&speechType=6","Summary":"National Security Defense Foreign Affairs Economy and Fiscal","Source":null,"Location":"Lima, OH","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-lima-army-tank-plant\/","CleanText":"Well, you better love me; I kept this place open, that I can tell you. (Applause.) They said, 'We're closing it.' And I said, 'No, we're not.' And now you're doing record business. The job you do is incredible. And I'm thrilled to be here in Ohio with the hardworking men and women of Lima. (Applause.) And this is some tank plant. There's nothing like it in the world. You make the finest equipment in the world. You really know what you're doing. They just gave me a little briefing on a couple of those tanks. I want to get into them but then I remember when a man named Dukakis got into a tank. (Laughter.) And I remember him; he tanked when he got into the tank. (Laughter.) He tanked , I never saw anybody tank like that. So I said, maybe I'll , but I'm a little bigger than him; I think it probably would work out okay. How would I look in a tank? Okay? (Applause.) Yeah, not bad. (Applause.) Not bad. The helmet was bigger than he was. That was not good. (Laughter.) We're here today to celebrate a resounding victory for all of you, for northwest Ohio, and for our great military, and for our entire country. Incredible victory. (Applause.) After so many years of budget cuts and layoffs, today, jobs are coming back and pouring back, frankly, like never before. Companies are coming back into our country; they want the action. Production is ramping up in the biggest way. And the awesome M1 Abrams tank is once again thundering down the assembly line. (Applause.) A-1. I want to thank Acting Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan. He's done an incredible job. In fact, ISIS , let me tell you about ISIS. They're not doing so well. You know, we took over the caliphate. You'll see it tonight. When I came in, it was a mess. Where the hell is that chart? (Laughter.) Folks, they gave me all economic charts. They didn't give me the ISIS chart. But if you did , bring it up if anybody has it. Bring it up. When I took over, it was a mess. They were all over the place. All over the , all over Syria and Iraq. And you'd see it was a sea of red. And now you look at it and there's no red. No red. And you look at some of the economic numbers; nobody thought we'd ever see numbers like that in our country , not a for a long time, not for ever. And what we're doing has been incredible. What you're doing has been more incredible. You stuck it out and now you've got one of the most successful military plants anywhere in the world. It's great. (Applause.) So thank you very much, Pat Shanahan. Also thank you to the Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper. He's been fantastic. Thank you. Oh, good. Better late than never. (Laughter.) Here's the story: So, you know, I don't want to have them make a big chart because it costs too much. You know, I'm a business guy. They said, 'Sir, we could make a big chart.' I said, 'How much does it cost?' Like it matters. But it matters to me. Does that make sense to you? So, two maps, identical , except the one on top was Syria. See that? The one on top was Syria in November of '16. You remember that date? November of '16. November 8th. We had a little victory that night. (Applause.) We had a little victory. But a lot of us weren't surprised by it, but the other side said, 'Where did all of those people come from?' (Laughter.) And I said, 'They just didn't like candidates for a lot of years. They didn't vote.' So what happens is , this is all ISIS. Now, on the bottom , that's as of today , this is ISIS. There's none. The caliphate is gone, as of tonight. (Applause.) Pretty good. That's pretty good, right? We took over a mess. We took over a mess with North Korea. We took over a mess in the Middle East. We took over. A lot of bad things were happening and the economy was not doing well. It was heading in the wrong direction. You remember that. It was going to go bad, and then we opened up with the regulation cuts and all of the other things we've done, including the big tax cut. (Applause.) But it made a big difference. Made a big difference. And we'll show you some numbers in a little while. I want to also thank Major General Brian Cummings for the incredible leadership and service you have done. An unbelievable job. Thank you, Brian. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) We're also honored to be joined by several of the Ohio leaders, friends of mine , terrific people: Senator Rob Portman. Rob, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Rob. A man who I will never, I promise, wrestle. He was one of the best wrestlers in the history of college wrestling. His record is so ridiculously good. I said, 'Were you as good as Dan Gable?' He said, 'No.' See, if it were me, I would've said, 'Yes, I was much better.' (Laughter.) You know who Dan Gable is. Jim Jordan, a great guy. (Applause.) And a great champion. A great, great athlete. Great champion. Thank you. He is tough. You'll want to have him on your side. Another one you want on your side always is Mike Turner. Mike, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Mike. Great. Warren Davidson. Warren, thank you. (Applause.) And, Bob Latta, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Warren and Bob. (Applause.) And a man who we're very proud of because, along with Mike, he ran a great race: Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted. He ran a great race for Governor. (Applause.) We came in that final day , they were a little bit down, against a tough opponent, who I was not a big fan of, and I didn't like the people that were supporting him too much , Pocahontas and others. (Laughter.) And I came that final day, and we had a day that was incredible and they won by , what did you win by? Six or seven points, right? It was an incredible , huh? Even higher. That's pretty good. Good. I'll see Mike in a little while. That's great. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Proud of you. To our plant leaders, Lieutenant Colonel Travis Adkins and Henry Kennedy , (applause) , we appreciate everything you do to keep the Army 'Rolling Along' full speed ahead. (Applause.) Incredible job. We're grateful to General Dynamics , incredible company , Phebe Novakovic. How did I do with that one? Novak-ovic. It's a little tricky, but that's okay. What a job you do. Thank you. Great job. Thank you for the tour, too. (Applause.) And the hardworking members of the United Auto Workers. (Applause.) Now, you've got to get over to a place that I like a lot, Lordstown. And you've got to get that. You know, the only place , General , what's going on with General Motors? We have the best economy we've ever had. We have the lowest employment , unemployment that we've had in 51 years; soon will be the record of all time. And what's going on with General Motors? Get that plant open or sell it to somebody and they'll open it. Everybody wants it. Sell it to somebody or open it yourselves. Get it going now and the UAW will help you. (Applause.) The UAW , you're going to help. The UAW just promised they're going to help. Get it open now. Don't wait. They said they have discussions coming up in September, October. I said, why not tomorrow? Why not on Monday? What do you have to wait months for? Get the discussions going. Get it open. Lordstown is a great area. I guess I like it because I won so big there. (Laughter.) But we're doing a job, and this state has been , we're very proud of what's happened in Ohio under our federal auspices. We've gotten so many things done, and this plant is one of our great achievements. To all of our active-duty service members and our wonderful veterans, thank you for serving your country , (applause) , with such tremendous distinction and honor. And to every welder, and machinist, and assembler, and mechanic, and engineer, and electrician, and carpenter, and every patriot here at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center: Thank you for pouring out your heart and your sweat and your soul to help restore the might of the American military, which very soon will be stronger than it ever was. We've bought billions and billions of dollars' worth of new planes and tanks and many other things. So, thank you all. Great job. (Applause.) And the fact is we have the best tanks driven by the best soldiers, made by the best workers anywhere in the world. And that's true. A lot of people are asking, because they love me, and they ask me about a man named John McCain. And if you want, I could tell you about , should I or not? Yes? Yes? So, I have to be honest: I've never liked him much. Hasn't been for me. I've really , probably never will. But there are certain reasons for it, and I'll tell you. And I do this to save a little time with the press later on. John McCain received a fake and phony dossier. Did you hear about the dossier? It was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton. Right? And John McCain got it. He got it. And what did he do? He didn't call me. He turned it over to the FBI, hoping to put me in jeopardy. And that's not the nicest thing to do. You know, when those people say , because I'm a very loyal person. John McCain campaigned for years to repeal and replace Obamacare , for years, in Arizona. A great state. I love the people of Arizona. But he campaigned, for years, for 'repeal and replace.' So did Rob and so did a lot of senators. When he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against 'repeal and replace.' He voted against, at 2 o'clock in the morning. Remember 'thumbs down'? We said, 'What the hell happened?' He said, two hours before, he was voting to repeal and replace. And then he went thumbs down, badly hurting the Republican Party, badly hurting our nation, and hurting many sick people who desperately wanted good, affordable healthcare. We would've had it. This would've saved our country over a trillion dollars in entitlements, and we would have ended up making a great healthcare plan, frankly, with the Democrats because they would have had no choice. McCain didn't get the job done for our great vets and the VA, and they knew it. That's why, when I had my dispute with him, I had such incredible support from the vets and from the military. The vets were on my side because I got the job done. I got Choice and I got Accountability. Accountability , meaning, if somebody mistreats our vets , for 45 years they were trying , they mistreat our vets, and we say, 'Hey, you're fired. Get out.' You can't mistreat our vets. They never got it done. (Applause.) And Choice , for year and years, decades, they wanted to get Choice. You know what Choice is. You're a military person. You're one of our great people. To me, one of the great people. For many decades, they couldn't get it done. It was never done. I got it five months ago. I got it done , Choice. Instead of waiting in line , a vet fought for us, fought in these tanks; fought for us. Instead of waiting in line for two days, two weeks, two months , people on line, they're not very sick. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill. We gave them Choice. If you have to wait for any extended period of time, you go outside, you go to a local doctor. We pay the bill; you get yourself better. Go home to your family. And we got it passed. We got it done. And the other thing is we're in a war in the Middle East that McCain pushed so hard. He was calling Bush , President Bush , all the time: 'Get into the Middle East. Get into the Middle East.' So now we're into that war for $7 trillion. Thousands and thousands of our people have been killed, millions of people overall. And frankly, we're straightening it out now, but it's been a disaster for our country. We've spent tremendous wealth , tremendous wealth , and tremendous lives in that war. And what do we have? It's worse than it was 19 years ago. I call them the 'endless wars.' Nineteen years ago, when we started. So, John McCain loved it. I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted , which, as President, I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get 'thank you.' That's okay. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain. So now, what we could say is: Now we're all set. I don't think I have to answer that question, but the press keeps, 'What do you think of McCain? What do you think?' Not my kind of guy. But some people like him, and I think that's great. Now let's get back and let's get on to the subject of tanks and this economy. Because you know what? We love what we are and what we do more than anything else. We build great, we fight great, and we're right now in Lima, and Lima is an incredible place, a place of strength and dedication. Since 1941, this plant has built and serviced thousands of tanks and military vehicles that powered American forces through World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Iraq, and Afghanistan. And the tanks are the best in the world , better than ever before. Every single Abrams tank in existence , the steel and the aluminum warhorse; they're really a warhorse of American ground forces , it was built or serviced on these very grounds by you people. By you people. But under the previous administration, this tank factory , the last of its kind anywhere in the Western Hemisphere , came very close to shutting down. Four straight years, the number of U.S. tanks that were budgeted for upgrades was zero. Does anybody remember that? Raise your hands. Do you remember that? Zero. That was under your great President Obama. Our military readiness declined and your workforce was slashed by 60 percent. But those days are over. We are rebuilding the American military. We are restoring American manufacturing. And we are once again fighting for our great American workers. Over the last two years, we have secured nearly $1.5 trillion to provide our warfighters the finest aircraft, ships, missiles, and tanks anywhere on Earth. We make the best equipment on Earth. And we sell that equipment, as you know, to good allies. Although, sometimes the good ones turn out to be not so good, and then we do something. We figure it out. You know what you have to do? You figure it out. This year, we're asking for an additional $750 billion, which is a record. That includes funding to upgrade more than 160 mighty M1 Abrams tanks. Congratulations. (Applause.) Congratulations. These historic investments are making America safer and our workforce stronger. From the awe-inspiring F-35 fighter in Texas to the Ford-class aircraft carriers in Virginia , we're now building the largest aircraft carrier anywhere in the world. In fact, I'm hearing it's actually the largest ship ever built. It is seriously big. I was there recently. It's something , it's like landing at an airport, although you have to be very talented, still, to land on those decks, no matter how you figure it. Some people can do it and some people can't. Some very good pilots can. To advance missile defense systems in Alabama, American workers are building the most cutting-edge, modern, and powerful military anywhere on the planet. At the heart of our military rebuilding is our investment in the legendary M1 Abrams tank. And I will tell you, the investment has paid off because the technology is so , if you look at this tank from now, and you go back 10 years and look at the tank, it's a like a whole different , it's a whole different deal, isn't it? A whole different deal. Over the next three years, we're investing more than $6 billion in upgrades and modifications to these tanks , that's going to keep you very busy here , almost twice the amount spent in the entire eight years of the previous administration, which was going down to nothing. Because you were closed; this place was closed. And I heard about it. And I got calls from Jim Jordan and Rob, and everybody, saying, 'You just can't do this.' And after I studied the situation, I said, 'We're not only not going to close in Lima, we're going to expand.' And that's what took place. So you owe a lot to a lot of your great political leaders. Our investment , (applause) , our investment in you is also a tremendous win for American taxpayers. By modernizing this plant and accelerating production, we will bring the cost down by 20 percent, saving taxpayers nearly $3 million on every single tank. That's not bad. With the help of everyone in this room, we are giving our warriors the most effective, reliable, and lethal battle tank in the history of war. Would you say that's correct? (Applause.) So how does this compare with the tanks made in China and Russia and other places? What do you think? Can we take them? (Applause.) They say it's much better. America does not need conflict. But if conflict comes, and you know the story , you've got to be strong if conflict comes , we will dominate the battlefield, and we will win, win, win. We're now set up to win, win, win. When I came in, we had some big problems. You look at what we've done on so many fronts. And we actually have better relationships. They respect our country more than they've ever respected it. Our country is respected again. The United States is respected again. (Applause.) To help meet our military needs, I am very proud to report that 400 new jobs are coming here to Lima, compared to just a few years ago, and we're doubling the size of your workforce. (Applause.) We need to. Our investment will also support thousands of additional jobs across our nation to assemble these incredible Abrams tanks. The engines are from Alabama, transmissions are from Indiana, special armor from Idaho, and the 120-millimeter gun , and the gun parts from upstate New York and from Pennsylvania. All great places. In Ohio alone, almost 200 suppliers churn out parts and materials that go into every tank that rolls off this factory's floor. Incredible. What you achieve here at this plant is truly remarkable. And equally remarkable is that they wanted to close it. No good. Every day you start with a powerful, heavy, but sometimes rust-covered, hollowed-out hull , and with incredible skill and extraordinary care , you restore its unmatched power, strength, and glory with all brand new equipment inside. The best in the world. The amazing restorations you accomplish every day are a perfect symbol for what we're doing with American manufacturing all across our nation. And we just came out , another chart , we just came out with numbers , the Economic Report of the President: 3.1 percent GDP. The first time in 14 years that we cracked 3, right? (Applause.) That's pretty good , 3.1. The press tried to make it 2.9. I said, 'It's not 2.9.' What they did is they took odd months. I said, 'No, no, no. You go from January to December. You don't take certain months and add them up.' Because I said, 'We're going to break 3.' And we did. We did 3.1. The fake news tried to change it but we caught them. (Laughter.) I said , I said, 'You know, we didn't break the 3. Oh, that's terrible.' They said, 'Yes, sir, you did. They just took odd months.' I said, 'No, no, January to December.' 3.1 percent, first time in 14 years. Congratulations. (Applause.) Sort of incredible. It's true. This chart is a beauty. This is 'Venture Capital Deals Surged Following the Passage of' , really, the election , rising nearly $17 billion. You know what that means. So here's your charts , going along , and here's us. See the red line there? It's like a rocket ship. (Applause.) Can you see that? It's small but cheap , (laughter) , and it gets the point across, right? A couple of other things , because I think this report is incredible. So these are 'Workers Coming Off the Sidelines,' and now it's just , this is just partially. So, the blue. The blue. The red. That's a big difference. That's a tremendous difference. The most in many, many years. And everyone said, 'You couldn't do it, couldn't bring back manufacturing jobs.' Remember? 'You'd need a magic wand.' We're bringing them back beyond anybody's expectations. You see the red line here? These are 'Wages are Rising for the Workers.' These are 'Wages are Rising.' (Applause.) 3.4 percent , it's one of the largest increases in 20 years. And for the most part, they were going down. They weren't even rising. I used to campaign , I'd be in Ohio, I'd be in Pennsylvania, I'd be all over, and I'd talk about wages where people would have to work three jobs and they were making less than they did 20 years ago. You remember that, Rob? Jim? I used to do it all the time. I'd be , it was just a part of my speech. I'd say, 'You're working three jobs. You make less money than you did 20 years ago.' And it was literally 21 years. And now wages are going up. And you have something else that's happening. If you don't like working here , and you all do , and I don't want to lose anybody. And who the hell would want to leave this place? This is what you call a great , a great place to work. (Applause.) But if for any reason , if for any reason you did, you can pick out six, seven, eight other jobs. In other words, you can finally have a job that you really like, where you like getting up in the morning. I do. I do, even though I have the fake news hounding me all the time. (Applause.) The fake and phony and corrupt. It's fake. It's corrupt. But we got to live with it, right? Got to live with it. But you guys , you do; you get up in the morning, you love to come, and you love your job, or you wouldn't be doing what I just witnessed back there when I looked at some of these incredible tanks. And here's another chart: 'Deregulating and Saving' , through the roof. Here's a chart: 'The American Energy.' The United States is the largest producer , that's happened over the last short period of time , of crude oil and natural gas in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia. We're also a net , do you think Russia is happy about this? I don't think so. You know, Hillary wanted to put windmills all over the place. Let's put up some windmills. 'When the wind doesn't blow, just turn off the television, darling, please.' (Laughter.) 'No wind out today. There's no wind. Please turn off the television, quickly.' (Laughter.) Put the windmills up and watch the value of your house , if you're in sight of a windmill, watch the value of your house go down by 65 percent. Wonderful to have windmills. And solar is wonderful too, but it's not strong enough and it's very, very expensive. So the United States is now the largest producer of crude oil and natural gas in the world. Happened all in that very short , you know, you guys are all so , (applause) , think of that. Think of that, beating out Saudi Arabia and Russia. They're pretty good producers, right? Guess what? We do more than they do. And in a short period of time, as soon as we get some pipelines opened in Texas, we'll be able to almost double it. Double it. What we're doing is incredible. We approved the Keystone Pipeline. Right? I did that. Forty-eight thousand jobs between that and the Dakota Access Pipeline. I got them approved, like almost my first couple of days in office. I said, 'They're approved.' And what is it? It's good environmentally. It's underground. You're not riding it over tracks. You're not trucking it. It's actually a great thing, environmentally. But President Obama, after years and years and years, they said, 'We're not going to approve it.' I said, 'We'll approve it.' Forty-eight thousand jobs. Think of it. It's being built right now. They're both being built. One just got completed , Dakota Access. And many, many other cases like that. Plants all over the country are going up. But the thing that's the greatest is companies that left us , they no longer wanted to be in the USA , they're coming roaring back. Toyota , $13.5 billion. We've created more than almost 6 million jobs since the election. And if I would have said that to the fake news during the campaign, they would've said, 'He exaggerates.' I'm not exaggerating, but nobody would've believed that could happen. Including almost 600,000 manufacturing jobs. We could've taken your jobs, all. If it weren't for me, this place would've been closed. Would have been closed. (Applause.) Would have been closed, fellas. And you're doing us a favor because of the great job you do. It's not just a one-way street. You're doing us a favor. Last year, our manufacturers reported the highest level of optimism ever recorded in a 40-year-old poll. And this year we went up again. Went from 56 percent , and it stayed there for years, between 50 and 56 , to 94 percent. They've never had anything like it. That's optimism. (Applause.) And we , all of us , are living by two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. (Applause.) Very simple. Unemployment has recently reached the lowest rate in 51 years. Other than that, we're not doing well. (Laughter.) More , and think of this: More Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country. Almost 160 million people. More than ever before, by far. And if you look at African American , you've heard me say this many times , African American employment is at an all-time low , unemployment. Asian American unemployment is at an all-time low. Hispanic unemployment , an all-time low. Women's unemployment , 65-year low. Soon it'll be historic, meaning better than ever. And soon the basic number will be historic. We've reduced the number of unemployed veterans by nearly 50 percent. I'm so proud of that. That's why the veterans like me more than other people. (Applause.) That's why they like me. (Applause.) Fifty percent since the election. And veteran unemployment is now at the lowest level ever, ever, ever recorded. Thanks to our pro-American tax, regulatory, and trade policies , and, by the way, we're doing great in our deal with China. They were taking out 500 billion a year for many years from our country. I consider that we've rebuilt China. Five hundred billion, not million. Think of what that means. Five-hundred billion dollars a year taken out of our country. And now they're paying us. They're paying tariffs on the products they're sending in, and we're negotiating and they want to make a deal. And hopefully, we'll make a deal. And if we don't, that's fine. And if we do, that's fine. It's got to be a good deal. It can't be a bad deal. We're so far down, it's got to be a great deal. If it's not a great deal, we'll never catch up. And their economy is way down. And I don't want their economy to be down; I want their economy to be up. But their economy is down 32 to 38 percent. And our economy, if you look at the numbers, since my election, is up almost 50 percent. Fifty. That's some difference. (Applause.) And the world economy , the world economy is not good. And frankly, if the world economy were good, that would be, in a way, good for us. So we're fighting there. We're bucking. Europe is down, Asia is down , a lot of places. Almost every place is down. Except the United States is up. And we're way up. And just think of what that would be. The world goes up; we go up with the world. The world is down, but we still go up. Something is happening. That wouldn't happen under Barack Obama, that I can tell you. It wouldn't happen under Crooked Hillary Clinton. (Laughter.) Last week, as I said, Toyota announced a massive investment. They're going to be expanding factories all across our nation. And they're going to be soon building new ones. Ford is bringing hundreds of new jobs to Chicago and other places. Tremendous amount of car companies are coming into the great state of Michigan, and they're coming into the great state of Ohio. Volkswagen is creating 1,000 brand new jobs in the state of Tennessee. And Chrysler is building Detroit's first new car factory in a generation , so long ago , in a generation. (Applause.) Think of that. Michigan. Michigan. You know, the nice part about running for President this time, as opposed to last time , last time, you know, I said I was going to do it, but I didn't do it. But I said I was going to do it. This time, I've done it far greater than I said I was going to do it. So it's going to be really easy on the debate stage when they hit me with nonsense and I say, 'Really? But African American unemployment , the best it's ever been.' Hispanic, Asian, women, everybody , it's all the best it's ever been. How do you top that in a debate? What are they going to say? 'Uh, well, it could be better'? (Laughter.) No, the easy part , and I say this to all of your political leaders here , if you do a good job, it's a lot easier that second time. But nobody has done the job that we've done. And I say 'we' because you've been on our side. Your union leaders aren't on my side, by the way. I watched them on television. They're not. But the unions , the people that work there are on our side. It's true. (Applause.) It's true. I had , I had union leaders in the White House a few months ago , the biggest guys. Nice guys, but they're Democrats no matter what. Okay? And you see where that's taken you. That would've been catastrophic. But I had them in, and we explained how good it was for the car industry, for this, for that. They said, 'Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, this is unbelievable. Thank you, sir.' But then I see one of the guys the next day on a television show. The , I think it was called 'Deface the Nation.' (Laughter.) And , ladies and gentlemen, 'Deface the Nation.' And he's saying how he's a Democrat and he wants Democrat policies , which were, by the way, putting everybody in the poorhouse. But I just left the guy. He's hugging me, kissing me, telling him what an unbelievable deal. Nobody else could do it. And the next day, he's on there talking about stuff. And I really said, 'I sort of don't want to meet these guys. I want to deal with the people in the union, not the heads of the union.' (Applause.) Because the heads of the union are not honest people. They're not honest, and they ought to lower your dues, by the way. They ought to stop with the dues. They , you're paying too much dues. (Applause.) As an example, they could've kept General Motors. They could've kept it in that gorgeous plant at Lordstown. They could've kept it. Lower your dues. Lower your dues. America's Founders understood that to be strong and powerful as a nation, we must also be a great manufacturing nation. President Obama said, 'You'll never bring manufacturing back.' I said, 'What are you talking about?' It's all about manufacturing. And we're bringing it back in record numbers. (Applause.) Nobody can believe it. And these are talented jobs. These are great jobs. These are genius jobs. And these are really well-paying jobs, as you people know. You get a lot of money. Let's negotiate. (Laughter.) We must not be dependent upon others for the resources we need to protect our people. When we open this plant, a couple of my people , I have some good business people , they said, 'Let's make a deal with the workers before we open it. We'll make a great deal.' I said, 'I agree we can do that, but we're not going to do that. These people have suffered enough.' We're going to open the plant and everybody is going to be happy. You understand what I mean by that. That's why my administration is restoring America's defense industrial base by bringing great jobs and great wages to plants just like this in Lima. Economy and strength is security. And it's all about security and national security. It's about loving our country. It's about loving our flag. You know that. (Applause.) Now, as result of my very tough trade actions , something I'm very proud of , America's steel and our steel mills are roaring back to life. You know that. You see it all over. We put a big, fat beautiful tariff on that dumped steel. It's sand steel. It's mud steel. It's crap steel. And they're dumping it all over. I said, 'That's okay, you can dump but we're going to charge you 25 percent when you come in and think you're going to take our jobs and give us bad steel.' I know a lot about , I've used a lot of steel. Right here in Ohio, Nucor has just announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. (Applause.) Charter Steel announced plans to build a brand new, 150-million-dollar steel plant in Cuyahoga Heights. JSW Steel is restarting the furnace , that's a massive furnace , and investing $500 million in Mingo Junction. And Cleveland Cliffs announced a brand new, 700-million-dollar plant in Toledo, Ohio. (Applause.) Don't leave here, though. Don't leave here. Don't get any ideas. Don't get leave here. Just stay here. Just relax. Stay here. We don't want you going to Mingo Junction. We're also finally fixing the horrible trade deals that have cost our nation trillions of dollars and where we've lost millions and millions and millions of jobs, like we were stupid people. They closed a plant; they move it to Mexico. They make the product; they sell it right in the United States. No tax. All we end up with is loss and no jobs. We get no taxes. We get nothing. That doesn't happen anymore. Under our new deal, there's a tremendous financial disincentive to close up plants and move them to other countries. You're not going to see that anymore. (Applause.) And we're getting rid of the disaster known as NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated in the history of the world. (Applause.) All over the country, you still see empty plants, when they haven't been converted to nursing homes and apartments, right? It's not the same thing as a plant. I love apartments. I love the business. But that's not the same thing as a plant where you have 5,000 people working. Not the same thing. And replacing it , we're replacing NAFTA with the great U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. Like the song. If you can't remember , YMCA, right? We'll play the song for you, everybody. USMCA. We've taken historic action to confront China's trading abuses, because the days of stealing American jobs and our ideas and our wealth have come to an end, folks. They've come to an idea, all right? They've come to an end. (Applause.) We've made some progress. That's why you see these numbers. Look at that chart. Look at that. You don't have to know what's on it. What difference , look at the line. (Laughter.) You don't have to know what the hell is on it. All you know is that's a good line. (Laughter.) Technological positive change. That's okay, right? It's all like that. That's what it is. Rob, Jim, that's what it is. Turner, see that? Look. That's what we fight for, right? Huh? That's what we're all fighting for. In everything we do and every action we take, we're putting America first, and we are putting American workers first, for the first time in a long time. (Applause.) So just in closing, I'd like to now introduce a couple of truly incredible workers from right here , I guess you know these folks , right here at the tank plant to share quickly their stories with you. Adam Stahler is a Quality Engineer who has worked at the plant for 10 years. His son, Derek, is a Specialist with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Hood, Texas. Great Place. Derek operates and maintains Stryker personnel carriers, one of the vehicles produced right here in Lima. Adam, thank you for everything your family has done for our nation. Please come up and say a few words. Adam, thank you. (Applause.) Boy, you're a young guy. How old are you? Wow. You look like your son. Thank you. (Applause.) I thought Adam was the son. Look how young he looks. (Laughter.) He's got a son working out there? Wow. Whatever you're eating, Adam, keep eating it. (Laughter.) It's working. Jay Baldwin is a Boiler Operator and a proud Army veteran. After serving as a tank crewman on the M1, now Jay helps build the M1 right here. You know him. Jay, please come on up. (Applause.) Wow. Thank you. Thank you. That's so nice, Jay and Adam. I appreciate it. You never know what you get when you come up. It's live. (Laughter.) But you couldn't do better than that, right? That's great. Thank you, fellas. That's great. I want to also thank all of the patriots here today. You remind us that the might of America's armed forces also depends upon the skill and devotion of all of America's workers. And you really are doing a job. We're very proud of you. For nearly 80 years, the exceptional workers at this plant has embodied the strength of the American spirit. Those who choose to work here are drawn not just by the promise of a good paycheck but by the power of patriotism , every single one of you is a patriot , the chance to go to work every morning to help protect this nation that we so deeply love. That's why veterans make up more than one third of the workforce at this wonderful plant. We very much stress: We want, wherever we can, we want veterans. That's why you check , (applause) , right? That's right. And that's why you check and recheck every bolt, every single thing having to do with that incredible tank , every pin, every wire, every square inch of each tank before it leaves the floor. And I just got a little news that was given to me as I was walking up. U.S. forces, in the last month, have killed the terrorists responsible for the attack in Syria that killed four Americans, the Paris theater attack in 2015, and the USS Cole bombing in 2000. We killed them all. (Applause.) We killed them all. We killed them all. We killed them all. They're bad people. But that's why you show up early and you stay late, and always get the job done right. You're proud of your work. You do it better than anyone, anywhere in the world , what you do. No country on Earth can match you and no country can match what you do. In just a few months, we will commemorate the 75th anniversary of one of the many victories that workers at the Lima Army Tank Plant helped make possible: the Normandy landings on D-Day, June 6, 1944, in the Second World War. It was right here on these very grounds that thousands of American workers modified M4 Sherman tanks in preparation for a battle that would forever change the course of human history. Right here. (Applause.) The workers who rallied to the Lima plant came from all over northwest Ohio and beyond. They were farmers and refinery workers and shopkeepers and homemakers who rolled up their sleeves and got to work when their country needed them the most. Normandy. Many of them had full-time jobs elsewhere. They punched out at one job, then came here and punched right back in. Not for the money. They knew and fully understood the importance of what they did and what they represented. And if they were lucky, they might catch a few hours' sleep on the loading dock before doing it all again, day after day, day after day. In just three years, the patriots of Ohio cranked out more than 100,000 military vehicles , a truly amazing feat that helped give America the power to vanquish tyranny, defeat our enemies, and save freedom for the entire world. This is the legacy that each of you inherits. And America knows you will carry it forward with the same purpose and passion that you've poured into this factory each and every day. We love you. We see your legacy in every battlefield victory, in the smiling faces of every soldier that returns home safely, and every time a citizen proudly salutes our great American flag. Because it is here in Lima , right here , that American greatness is forged with American hands, with American heart, and with American pride. (Applause.) True. True. We don't know what challenges will come, what dangers we must face, or what opportunities we must seize. But we know that America will always be ready because of you and your strength, and your skill and your drive, and your unbreakable spirit. Because of hardworking citizens like you, the people of Lima, the people of Ohio, and the people of America will always fight on to victory, victory, victory. You don't know how to lose. You never will have to find out. You'll never have to find out about losing. Together, we shall forever be one nation, under God. (Applause.) So I want to thank you. I want to say God bless you, God bless Ohio, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. (Applause.)"}

Please be seated. I am truly delighted to welcome so many impressive young Americans to the White House. This is a very exciting day. What we're doing is very important. And we're here to take historic action to defend American students and American values. They've been under siege. In a few moments, I will be signing an executive order to protect free speech on college campuses. Just the thought of it sounds good. We're grateful , (applause). It's true. We're very grateful to be joined today by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. Betsy? Where are you, Betsy? Hi, Betsy. (Laughter.) And Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has done a really great job , we have prescription drug prices coming down , first time in 51 years, so , Alex Azar. Thank you very much, Alex. (Applause.) Most importantly, let me thank all of the college students and recent graduates here with me on stage. Incredible young people. These courageous Americans have stood up for [to] the forces of political indoctrinations , and they really stood up to it, too, like very few people have been able to; censorship; and coercion. You refused to be silenced by powerful institutions and closed-minded critics, of which there are many. You faced down intimidation, pressure and abuse. You did it because you love your country and you believe in truth, justice, and freedom. And I want to thank you all, everybody in the room, including a lot of folks in the audience. Charlie. A lot of folks, You've fought bravely for your rights and now you have a President who is also fighting for you. I'm with you all the way. Okay? All right? (Applause.) In America, the very heart of the university's mission is preparing students for life as citizens in a free society. But even as universities have received billions and billions of dollars from taxpayers, many have become increasingly hostile to free speech and to the First Amendment. You see it all the time. You turn on the news and you see things that are horrible. You see people being punched hard in the face. But he didn't go down. He didn't go down. (Applause.) I said, \"You have a better chin than Muhammad Ali, and he had a great chin.\" (Laughter.) And you see the cowbell scene. You saw that horrible scene. That was a disgraceful thing at a school, at a university. Under the guise of \"speech codes\" and \"safe spaces\" and \"trigger warnings,\" these universities have tried to restrict free thought, impose total conformity, and shut down the voices of great young Americans like those here today. These are great people. All of that changes starting right now. We're dealing with billions and billions and billions of dollars. (Applause.) Taxpayer dollars should not subsidize anti-First Amendment institutions. And that's exactly what they are: anti-First Amendment. Universities that want taxpayer dollars should promote free speech, not silence free speech. (Applause.) Today's groundbreaking action is the first in a series of steps we will take to defend students' rights. We are proudly joined by several young Americans who can speak directly about ideological intolerance on campus. Here with us is Ellen Wittman, a junior at Miami University in Ohio. A great school. Ellen is the President of Students for Life. In 2017, Ellen planned an annual event to display small wooden crosses representing the lives of the unborn. School officials informed Ellen that she would be required to post signs all over campus providing a \"trigger warning\" to other students regarding her display. Ellen, please come up. Say a few words. Tell us your story, please. (Applause.) Thank you. MS. WITTMAN: Well, thank you, Mr. President. This is a truly historic day in our country's history. And I am so grateful that we have a President who recognizes that the First Amendment is under attack on our college campuses. My story is so important because I have seen lives saved through my Students for Life efforts on campus. But I never imagined the hostility I would face when trying to express my beliefs. It's ridiculous that it has gotten to this point. Universities are supposed to be marketplaces of ideas. They should be encouraging free speech, not shutting it down. And speech is not free when university officials put conditions on student speech. The only permit we need to speak on campus is the First Amendment. Thank you, Mr. President. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: You watch, we will be witnessing today some great future political leaders. There's plenty of them in the room. Not just up here, right? Out there too. We really appreciate it. That was beautiful. Thank you very much. We're also joined by Kaitlyn Mullen, a student at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. While simply standing at a table to represent a conservative group on campus, Turning Point USA , which does such incredible work. And thank you very much, Charlie. It's true. Come on. We can give him a hand. (Applause.) Thank you. Kaitlyn was approached by staff and a graduate instructor, and was berated and cursed at. School officials tried to bully Kaitlyn into leaving, but she bravely stood her ground. Kaitlyn, please come up and say a few words. Okay, Kaitlyn? Thank you. (Applause.) MS. MULLEN: Thank you, Mr. President. What happened to me is common on universities today and students are getting shut down and silenced on campus. So I'm really thankful that President Trump is addressing this issue because, as the future of America, it's important that our universities are a place where we could speak freely and have healthy, respectful dialogue on campus. So thank you so much, President Trump, for doing this. No other student should have to go through what I've gone through on campus. So thank you. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you, Kaitlyn. Beautiful. And I have to say that, you know, we have , in my opinion, we have more than they have. People don't realize that. You see what's going on. I just came back from Ohio. The streets were lined with people. I came back recently from Alabama, where they had that horrible tornado. It was terrible. But the people were lined as far as the eye could see , lined up with people. And we're here. This is the White House. I'm the President. And we're together. And hopefully, we can bring everybody together. That's really what we want to do. And they can have different views. And if they do have different views, we encourage that. But they have to let you speak. They have to let you speak. Also here with us today is Polly Olson, a student at Northeast Wisconsin Technical College. Last year, Polly was handing out homemade Valentine's Day cards with messages such as \"You are special\" and \"Jesus loves you.\" College officials stopped her and told her that she would be restricted to so-called \"free speech zone\" because some people might find her cards offensive. I don't. (Laughter.) I love that card. (Applause.) In fact, Polly, give me some. I'll send them around to my friends. (Laughter.) Polly, please say a few words. Polly. Polly, thank you. (Applause.) MS. OLSON: So freedom of speech is near and dear to my heart. My mother told me while she was homeschooling me that I would need to know what my First Amendment rights were because someday they would be violated and I would have to stand up for them. So I'm carrying on her legacy of handing out these little valentines encouraging people to know that they are loved and cared for. And within 15 minutes of setting foot on my campus this past year, I was told that I was soliciting and disrupting the learning environment and that it would not be tolerated and that I would have to stop handing out my valentines. And I contacted some friends of mine and they sent me to WILL to have legal counsel because this wasn't the first time the school had done it to me. They had stopped me a year , well, a few months after my mom died , and told me that I was not allowed to do it then. So I went through months of trying to get them to change this policy that they were enforcing, and they told me that they would do it. Well, that was five years ago. So now it was time to take action and make them follow through with what they were telling me that they were going to do , trying to shut me up. I'm just one of many students that are out there that universities and schools are trying to shut down, sweep it under the rug, and make them be quiet. And I told them I'm not going to be quiet this time. I'm going to talk to anyone and everyone I can about our freedom of speech in this country because it's really the core of America's freedom. And without freedom of speech, we don't have America anymore. And so I challenge America to learn to love one another as Christ did on the cross for each one of us. And that , speak your differences. It's okay. We are in a country of freedom. And, really, that's what's important , is to embrace the diversity that we have here because that's made America great in the first place. And we need to carry on that legacy of protecting freedom of speech on campuses and in our workplaces. People at work should not be afraid to express their beliefs. It's our right. It's our freedom. Thank you. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: So thank you all for your courage. Today, we are delivering a clear message to the professors and power structures trying to suppress dissent and keep young Americans , and all Americans, not just young Americans like Ellen and Kaitlyn and Polly , from challenging rigid, far-left ideology. People who are confident in their beliefs do not censor others , we don't want to censor others , they welcome free, fair and open debate. And that's what we're demanding. Under the policy I am announcing today, federal agencies will use their authority under various grant-making programs to ensure that public universities protect, cherish , protect the First Amendment and First Amendment rights of their students, or risk losing billions and billions of dollars of federal taxpayer dollars. (Applause.) Every year, the federal government provides educational institutions with more than $35 billion in research funding. All of that money is now at stake. That's a lot of money. (Laughter.) They are going to not have to like your views a lot, right? (Laughter.) We will not stand idly by and allow public institutions to violate their students' constitutional rights. If a college or university doesn't allow you to speak, we will not give them money. It's very simple. (Applause.) At the same time, private universities should be held to their own policies on free speech. So, from now on, federal agencies will also use their grant-making authority to promote transparency for students at private schools. These colleges should not be able to promise free speech in theory, and then impose restrictive speech codes in practice, which is what many of them do. Today's action is just the beginning of our efforts to protect free speech and advance our students' rights agenda. What I've been witnessing over the last long period of time, long before I became President , what I've been witnessing is outrageous. This order will also empower students with vital information about the value of the programs they take on and , having to do with debt. Student loan debt. I'm going to work to fix it because it's outrageous what's happening. You're not given that fair start. You're too far down. It's not right. And we're going to work very, very hard to get it fixed. But we're going to start with 43 million people in the United States who are currently working to pay off student loans. And we'll be talking about that very soon. We're going to work on that very soon. I've always been very good with loans and , (laughter) , I love loans. (Laughter.) I love other people's money. (Laughter and applause.) And we're going to work on it. (Applause.) I made a lot of money with those loans, and you're going to, too. You're going to do something that's going to be fair and good. But we're going to work with you very closely. The average student loan borrower owes roughly $35,000 dollars , that's a lot , and, in many cases, much more than that. I've seen numbers that go over $200,000. You're behind the eight ball before you start. And yet, typically, students who take loans do not have access to critical information about what career outcomes they can expect from their programs, majors, or fields of study. They borrow more money than they can ever expect to pay off or pay back. Many middle-class American families are getting ripped off, while tax-exempt colleges and large institutions, frankly , they take these tremendous endowments. You look at the money that they have. They're making a fortune. For that reason, I am directing the Department of Education and the Department of Treasury to publish detailed information on future earnings and loan repayment rates for every major and every program at every single school. It's very important. (Applause.) Today's order also directs the Department of Education to propose a plan that will require colleges and universities to have skin in the game by sharing a portion of the financial risk of the student loan debt. I believe , (applause). I believe that colleges and universities, their costs have gone up more than anything I can think of. I've watched this. And you watch companies, and they'll keep it the same for years and years. And you watch these colleges and universities and certain institutions, where it just goes right through the roof. And the reason , there's no incentive to them to watch costs. You see people at the heads of the institutions being paid a fortune. They don't care because the government loans the student the money, they pay the money to the college, and then the student graduates from college , maybe a very good college, but they graduate , or university , and they're stuck with $200,000 in loans that they won't be able to pay off for a long time. So we're going to make them have an incentive to keep their costs down. Right now, they have no incentive whatsoever. I watched this over a period of time, I figured it out very, very quickly. I'm good at that stuff, believe me. (Laughter.) And I just see their numbers go up so rapidly because they just don't have the burden on them. And we're going to put burden on the institutions. We want them to get the best peop- , teachers and the professors and the administrators and the heads, but the numbers are out of reality. And certainly, they make it out of reality for students when you have to pay back those loans someday. With today's action and every action to come, the Trump administration will fight for America's students. We're fighting very hard. And remember what I said: We're going to give the student loans , where you have way, way over a trillion dollars in student loans , we're going to start looking at that very seriously and help some of those students that are just mired in debt. We know that freedom must prevail on college campuses if freedom is to prosper in America. It's so important. And we believe that greatness must be practiced in our halls of learning if greatness is to thrive in our halls of government and our corridors of commerce. You're going to have great lives. But I want you to get off to a great start, not a start where you're behind a barricade that just doesn't let you succeed. And we're going to make it much easier for you , this administration , and we've worked very hard on it already. We'll be having some meetings. And we'll be having some very major discussions with some of the biggest colleges and universities. And we're going to have them shoulder some of the responsibility and some of the money that's necessary for you to use in order to get your education. To every student and young American here today: Don't let anyone stop you from doing what you know is right, from asking questions, from challenging the powerful, or from speaking your mind. And that's the primary reason we're here right now. You're going to speak your mind. You're going to be fair. You're going to reasonable. You're going to do it well. And you're going to speak your mind. Never ever quit, never give in, and never back down. Keep standing up for your values, for your classmates, and for your country. And you can be certain that, every day of my presidency, we will always support your rights, and your freedoms, and your future. Thank you all for being here. This is a great honor for me. I've been watching this for too long. I've been watching things that are unwatchable and I don't like it. But we're going to do something about it. See? We like to act, as opposed to just watching and saying, \"Oh, isn't that a shame?\" We don't say that. (Laughter.) We don't say that. (Applause.) And I want to congratulate everybody , everybody , for being here. You have just a tremendous future ahead of you and this will make it a lot easier. And you get that point of view across. And listen to the other point of view. Maybe you can changed and maybe not. I doubt it. (Laughter.) But maybe. You never know. And you what? If you can, that's okay. And you'll change them, too. You're going to change them, too. But, ultimately, it brings people together. So congratulations. I'll sign right now. Thank you all for being here. (Applause.) (The executive order is signed.) Thank you very much.

And we'll be having some very major discussions with some of the biggest colleges and universities. And we're going to have them shoulder some of the responsibility and some of the money that's necessary for you to use in order to get your education. To every student and young American here today: Don't let anyone stop you from doing what you know is right, from asking questions, from challenging the powerful, or from speaking your mind. And that's the primary reason we're here right now. You're going to speak your mind. You're going to be fair. You're going to reasonable. You're going to do it well.

I've been watching this for too long. I've been watching things that are unwatchable and I don't like it. But we're going to do something about it. See? We like to act, as opposed to just watching and saying, 'Oh, isn't that a shame?' We don't say that. (Laughter.) We don't say that. (Applause.) And I want to congratulate everybody , everybody , for being here. You have just a tremendous future ahead of you and this will make it a lot easier. And you get that point of view across. And listen to the other point of view. Maybe you can changed and maybe not. I doubt it. (Laughter.) But maybe. You never know. And you what? If you can, that's okay. And you'll change them, too. You're going to change them, too. But, ultimately, it brings people together. So congratulations. I'll sign right now. Thank you all for being here. (Applause.) Thank you very much. (Applause.)"}

So, I will not comment on them. The country is always doing very well in every respect. I mean, we're just doing well. We're knocking it out of the park, as they say. And we're very happy about that. We did not pay money for our great Otto. There was no money paid. That was a fake news report that money was paid. I haven't paid money for any hostage. And I've gotten approximately , I think it's 20 or 21 out. We don't pay money for hostages. The Otto case was a very unusual case. But I just want to let you know no money was paid for Otto. Q Mr. President, what did you tell Don McGahn about Mueller? THE PRESIDENT: I never told Don McGahn to fire Mueller. If I wanted to fire Mueller, I would have done it myself. It's very simple. I had the right to. And frankly, whether I did or he did, we had the absolute right to fire Mueller. In the meantime, I didn't do it. I'm a student of history. I see what you get when you fire people, and it's not good. But there would have been nothing wrong with firing him. Legally, I had absolute right to fire, but I never told Don McGahn to fire Mueller. And, by the way , and Mueller finished out his report: no collusion and no obstruction. Q Mr. President, how do you beat Joe Biden? THE PRESIDENT: I think we beat him easily. Q Mr. President, measles cases are increasing. What do you tell parents? THE PRESIDENT: Speak. Up, up. You got a heli- , Q What do you tell parents about getting their kids vaccinated? Q Measles. THE PRESIDENT: Oh. They have to get the shot. The vaccinations are so important. This is really going around now. They have to get their shot. Q Mr. President, how old is too old to be President? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that , I just feel like a young man. I'm so young. I can't believe it. I'm the youngest person. I am a young, vibrant man. I look at Joe , I don't know about him. I don't know. Q Is he too old? THE PRESIDENT: I would never say anyone is too old, but I know they're all making me look very young, both in terms of age and I think in terms of energy. I think you people know that better than anybody. Yeah. Q Mr. President, do you still think there were \"very fine people on both sides\" in Charlottesville? THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I've answered that question. And if you look at what I said, you will see that that question was answered perfectly. And I was talking about people that went because they felt very strongly about the monument to Robert E. Lee, a great general. Whether you like it or not, he was one of the great generals. I have spoken to many generals here, right at the White House, and many people thought , of the generals, they think that he was maybe their favorite general. People were there protesting the taking down of the monument of Robert E. Lee. Everybody knows that. Q On North Korea, Kim Jong Un has said that he wants Pompeo to not be part of negotiations and that a peace deal depends on the U.S. attitude. What do you think about that? And what's the prospects for talks with North Korea? THE PRESIDENT: I think we're doing very well with North Korea. A lot of progress is being made. I appreciated President Putin's statement yesterday. He wants to see it done, also. I think there's a lot of excitement toward getting a deal done with North Korea. In the meantime, when I came here, there were nuclear tests, missile tests, rocket tests. We got our hostages back. We got remains back, and continue to come back from the war. Our great heroes , the remains. There's been no tests. There's been no nothing. So, at some point, you're going to report the facts. I have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un. I appreciate that Russia and China is helping us. And China is helping us because I think they want to. They don't need nuclear weapons right next to their country. But I also think they're helping us because of the fact that we're in a trade deal, which, by the way, is going very well. Q Will you let Don McGahn testify? THE PRESIDENT: What we're doing is executive , Q Did Don McGahn lie to Mueller? THE PRESIDENT: So what we're doing , in the history of our country, there has never been a President that's been more transparent than me or the Trump administration. I let White House Counsel McGahn testify. I let everybody testify. I think McGahn , Q (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. I think McGahn was in there for 30 hours. Who ever heard of such a thing? But I said I want everybody to testify. Obviously, McGahn thought he testified fine because he was with the administration for a long time after that. And I think he said he was just joining up with respect to the appointment of judges by the administration. But I let everybody testify. There has never, ever been transparency like this. So, just so you understand , so we got a great , Q (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. We get the ruling, which I knew we were going to get because I have nothing to do with Russia and the campaign. So we get a ruling: no collusion. We essentially get a ruling , no obstruction , based on the fact our great Attorney General made an immediate decision there was no obstruction. So, we have no collusion, no obstruction. We had total transparency. We gave 1.4 million documents, if you can believe such a ridiculous thing. Five hundred people testified. We had 18 people that were Trump haters; that includes Mr. Mueller. He was a Trump hater. Q I'm talking about Congress, Mr. President. Congress. THE PRESIDENT: And wait a minute. Wait, wait. Wait. With all of this , with all of this transparency, we finished \"no collusion, no obstruction.\" Right? Then I get out, the first the day they're saying, \"Let's do it again.\" And I said, \"That's enough.\" We got to , we have to run a country. We have a very great country to run. And, frankly, when I go through it with the House and the Senate and we have no collusion, no collusion, no obstruction, no obstruction. Then we have , again we have to go through it? This is a pure political witch hunt. We did nothing wrong. And the only thing I did is make our country stronger, give it the numbers like people haven't seen before. What we're doing in this country, financially, with the military, with our veterans , if you look at veterans, we now have Veterans Choice. Nobody has ever done what I've done in their first two years. So, if I'm guilty of anything, it's that I've been a great President and the Democrats don't like it, which is a shame. I'm going to Indianapolis. We're going to the NRA, and we look forward to it. Q How do you beat Biden? How do you do it?

And our nation is greater today than it has ever been. Stronger, richer. We're doing better than ever before. We are great Americans. You're doing a great job. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. We believe in the rule of law. And we will always protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. (Applause.) And there are some people that are running right now; I don't think they have that number one on their list. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. (Applause.) And we believe in the right to self-defense and the right to protect your family, your community, and your loved ones. We believe in the wisdom of our Founders. And we believe in freedom and liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) We know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. And above all else, we know this: In America, we don't worship government; we worship God. (Applause.) Every day of my administration, we are taking power out of Washington, D.C. and returning it to the American people, where it belongs. (Applause.) And you see it now better than ever, with all of the resignations of all of the bad apples. They're bad apples. They tried for a coup; didn't work out so well. (Applause.) And I didn't need a gun for that one, did I? (Laughter.) All was taking place at the highest levels in Washington, D.C. You've been watching, you've been seeing. You've been looking at things that you wouldn't have believed possible in our country. Corruption at the highest level , a disgrace. Spying, surveillance, trying for an overthrow. And we caught them. We caught them. (Applause.) Who would have thought in our country? But it's called what we all together have done , started two and a half years ago on that great November 8th. That was a great day. Remember that day? (Applause.) Great day. And in a year and a half, we have one called \"November 3rd.\" It's November 3rd this time. Get ready to vote. You better. You better get ready to vote. But it's all called \"draining the swamp,\" and we are doing it faster than anyone ever thought possible. Very proud of that. (Applause.) And around the world, America is respected again because we are finally putting America first. Been a long time. Our economy is now the hottest anywhere on the planet Earth. Just this morning, we learned that the GDP smashed expectations, with the economy growing at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter , always the worst quarter for whatever reason. 3.2. (Applause.) And if we kept the same interest rates and the same quantitative easing that the previous administration had, that 3.2 would have been much higher than that. But they hadn't hit these numbers in 16 years. We had a tremendous increase in inventory investment. You know what that means. And , listen to this , a very big increase in net exports. Isn't it about time? Isn't that nice? (Applause.) We've added almost 6 million jobs since my election. And if I would have said that during the campaign, all of those people back there , we call them the \"fake news\" , they wouldn't have believed it. They're fake. AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: They're fake. Blue-collar jobs recently grew at the fastest rate in more than three decades. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps since our election. (Applause.) Wages are rising fast, and the lowest-paid workers are making the biggest percentage gains of all. And that's nice to hear. It's about time. (Applause.) Unemployment recently achieved its lowest rate in 51 years, and very shortly, it should be its lowest rate in the history of our country. (Applause.)African American, Asian American, Hispanic American , have reached the lowest levels of unemployment in our history. (Applause.) America's future has never been brighter, and yet Democrats have never been angrier, especially now that their \"collusion delusion\" has been exposed to the world as a complete and total fraud. (Applause.) It's been the greatest political hoax ever in our country. Instead of working with us to rebuild our infrastructure, lower drug prices , which, by the way, this year, for the first time in 50 years, drug prices went down. (Applause.) They're going to go down a lot lower. And instead of working with us to fix our trade deals , which I'm doing without them , and continue creating millions and millions of new jobs, which we're doing at a level that people have not seen before, that people don't even believe, Democrats are obsessed with hoaxes, delusions, and witch hunts. It's what they're obsessed with. That's what they want to do. And we can play the game just as well or better than they do. (Applause.) Far-left radicals in Congress want to take away your voice, your jobs, your rights, and they especially want to take away your guns. You know that. They want to take away your guns. You better get out there and vote. You better get out there and vote. It seems like it's a long ways away. It's not. I was saying to Melania, our great First Lady, whose birthday it is today. Happy birthday, Melania! (Applause.) I remember standing, two and a half years ago, in the same hallway where Abraham Lincoln and so many others have stood. My first night in the White House and I said to Melania , I said, \"This is incredible.\" And four years seemed so long away. And now here we are. We're getting ready to start up the campaign again. Start up the campaign again. (Applause.) I never want to do anything with MAGA because MAGA country and MAGA , \"Make America Great Again\" has been great, but we've really made it great. We've made it great. We've brought it back. And we're thinking about , slogan: \"Keep America Great.\" Because you have socialists and far-left Democrats that want to destroy everything that we've done. Your 401(k)s are going through the roof. Your stock market, since the election, has hit a record high. Almost a hundred different records I've broken. Record high. But everyone is like a genius now. They buy stock and they're all up. Everybody is benefitting and jobs are benefitting. But it can all be taken away when you start putting the wrong people in office. We've cut regulations more than any President in the history our country. And that's in two years. In two years, we did more to regulation , (applause) , think of that , than any President in the history of our country. It's one of the reasons our jobs are booming; one of the reasons the economy is booming. We gave you the largest tax cut in the history of our country. The biggest, ever. (Applause.) And we got ANWR approved. And we got the individual mandate, the absolute worst part of Obamacare, eliminated. Now we're going for the rest. (Applause.) And we had it done except for one vote. You know what I'm talking about. One vote. In recent days, leading Democrats have proposed banning new guns and confiscating existing guns from law-abiding citizens. What they don't tell you is the bad guys aren't giving up their guns. And you're not going to be giving up your guns either. (Applause.) At the same time, House Democrats recently voted against notifying ICE , these brave, great, talented, brilliant patriots , when an illegal alien attempts to buy a gun, which is a felony. Democrats also support sanctuary cities that release thousands of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. In fact, they like the criminal aliens and aliens so much that when we're forced to release them into our country because of the horrible immigration laws that the Democrats refuse to give us the votes , we need some of their votes to change , we give them as many as they can handle. (Applause.) And they're not too happy about it, folks. They're not too happy. They said, \"Who came up with that idea?\" (Laughter.) They said, \"Only Trump could come up with that idea.\" (Laughter and applause.) We give them as many as they can handle. In other words, Democrats want to disarm law-abiding Americans while allowing criminal aliens to operate with impunity. But that will never happen as long as I'm your President. Not even close. (Applause.) I promise to defend the Second Amendment rights of every American, and I always will. I'll never let you down. (Applause.) Never let you down. I haven't so far, and I won't. Because as the famous saying goes, when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Very simple. (Applause.) The Democrats are also working hard to block the wall, but we are building the wall. They're not happy about it. And we will have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. (Applause.) We're building a lot of wall, and I want to thank Border Patrol. I want to thank our great military. And I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers. They've been incredible. And we are doing something that I could do very quickly, and we're doing it very quickly. But dealing with these people is very, very difficult, if you haven't noticed, okay? Any politician would've given up a long time ago. So we'll have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. It's going up rapidly. Rapidly. (Applause.) We're also renovating tremendous stretches of wall. We have wall that's in bad shape but it's structurally sound. And rather than building new, we renovate it. We make it as good as new, save a lot of money, and we gain a lot of territory. So we have a lot of great things going. A lot of great things going. (Applause.) Most importantly, Democrats must change our immigration laws right now. Right now. We can do it in , I used to say 45 minutes. We can do it in 15 minutes. It's very simple. You know the programs; they're horrible. The asylum , where rough, tough MS-13 gang members come in. You don't want to meet with these people, but ICE doesn't mind because ICE is throwing them out of our country by the thousands. And the Democrats want to eliminate ICE. Can you believe that? (Applause.) Boy, oh, boy. But it's incredible what they've done. It's incredible what we've done. But they stand there , asylum , and they read a statement, \"I am afraid for my life. I am afraid to go back to my country. I want to be an American!\" And you look and you see a toughness that you don't see. And you just see what happens with the mayor of Tijuana and others. They say, \"These people, we try and help them, and they start hitting us. They start punching us.\" We don't want them in our country, and they're not getting into our country. And when they have in the past , a lot of them have come in , we're throwing them the hell out. They're out. We're getting them out. (Applause.) But we can fix the problem so easy. And when we fix the problem , the wall is one thing. And that will have an incredible impact. But they won't even be coming up if we change our old, broken, ridiculous, weak immigration laws. They won't even be coming up. They won't make the journey. The wall is still good to have. We need the wall. But all of those people you see coming up , thousands and thousands of people , they won't be coming because they're going to say, \"There's no way we can get into the United States anymore, except by going through legal channels.\" And what we want is we want people. We need them for all of the great companies that are coming in. But people have to come into our country legally and through merit. Through merit. (Applause.) One of the gravest threats to the Second Amendment, and to American freedom itself, are activist judges. You see it every day. Every day. They almost always file in a certain little jurisdiction; I won't tell you what it is, but you all know. Every time we get sued on the ban, which we ended up winning , you know, we have the ban. We lost in the Ninth Circuit; we shouldn't have. We lost in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which we shouldn't have. And we won at the United States Supreme Court. So we have the ban. Travel ban. But the reporters , the other day, some reporter said, \"Donald Trump, who lost the travel ban \" I didn't lose it. Well, what he meant: I lost it in the Ninth Circuit. But he didn't say we won at the United States Supreme Court. So everybody said, \"Oh, that's too bad. He lost the \" No, no. We won the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court. (Applause.) But they don't say that. So when we confronted them, they said, \"No, we were referring to the lower courts.\" I said, \"What about the upper court? They ruled. It's done.\" \"Well, we weren't talking about the Supreme Court. We were saying you lost \" These are very, very dishonest people, okay? (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: Nobody gets it. Why? They're opposed to strong military. They're opposed to all of the things we've done, including making our nation wealthy, including high GDPs, including all of the security and all of the law enforcement, all of the things we're doing. It's incredible. Nobody understands it. Someday, we're going to figure it out, and I'll feel much better about it. But why are they opposed to things that truly make our country great? Why? Nobody gets it. I don't get it. The level of dishonesty and corruption in the media is unbelievable. (Applause.) But we're stuck with activist judges who seek to rewrite our Constitution to force their own radical views onto our country.That is why my administration has led a historic effort to confirm fair and impartial and mostly conservative judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. (Applause.) And I'm very proud to announce that we will soon have 145 federal judges confirmed , a record number , including two great Supreme Court judges , (applause) , Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh. (Applause.) Two fantastic justices. In fact, next week, we will confirm our 100th federal judge. Nobody knows what that means. The percentage is incredible. Nobody knows what that means. And in the end, I expect to have the second-highest percentage of judges confirmed in the history of the United States , more than any other President, except one , I'll never beat this one , percentage of judges approved. You know who the one is? Take a guess. George Washington. He gets 100 percent. (Applause.) No, he had 100 percent. He named every one of them. But you know what? We'll have more of them. George Washington. But we're also defending free speech on our college campuses. (Applause.) Last month, I signed an executive order requiring public colleges and universities to respect the First Amendment rights of their students, or risk losing tens of billions of dollars in federal funding. If you don't want to hear another voice, you don't get all of this tremendous amount , in some cases, ridiculous amounts of dollars. (Applause.) And we have shut down the previous administration's massive abuse of power known as Operation Choke Point. (Applause.) Under this ill-advised program, government bureaucrats discouraged banks from making loans to gun retailers , a backdoor attack on private gun ownership that will never be allowed to happen on my watch. That's step one, folks. (Applause.) Step one. You know what step two, three, and four is. Step four is: You don't have guns. You don't have any way to protect yourself. Today, I'm proud to announce another historic step to protect your Second Amendment rights. And I didn't tell Chris and Wayne and Oliver; I didn't even tell them about it. So they're listening in this big room someplace, and they're saying,\"I wonder what he's going to do.\" The good thing with me: You never know. (Laughter and applause.) Never know. That's why we're making trade deals that are so good for our country. So, in the last administration, President Obama signed the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. And in his waning days in office, he sent the treaty to the Senate to begin the ratification process. This treaty threatened your subjugate , and you know exactly what's going on here , your rights and your constitutional and international rules and restrictions and regulations. Under my administration, we will never surrender American sovereignty to anyone. (Applause.) We will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedom. And that is why my administration will never ratify the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. I hope you're happy. (Applause.) I'm impressed; I didn't think too many of you would really know what it is. You what it is? A big, big factor. But I see a couple of very happy faces from the NRA over there. And I am officially announcing today that the United States will be revoking the effect of America's signature from this badly misguided treatment [agreement]. We're taking our signature back. (Applause.) The United Nations will soon receive a formal notice that America is rejecting this treaty. (Applause.) As part of this decision, I will sign right now, in front of a lot of witnesses , a lot , (applause) , it's a lot of witnesses , a message asking the Senate to discontinue the treaty ratification process and to return the now-rejected treaty right back to me, in the Oval Office, where I will dispose of it. (Applause.) By taking these actions, we are reaffirming that American liberty is sacred and that American citizens live by American laws, not the laws of foreign countries. Thank you. (Applause.) [The President holds up document.] They all want the pen. Can you believe these people? (Laughter.) Should I give it to them? AUDIENCE: Yeah! THE PRESIDENT: Famous pen. As we protect gun rights for law-abiding citizens, we are also getting guns out of the hands of violent criminals. When I took office two years ago, one of my highest priorities was to reduce violent crime. In the two years before my inauguration, the murder rate had increased by more than 20 percent, and the United States had experienced the largest increase in violent crime in over 25 years. For this reason, my administration resurrected Project Safe Neighborhoods, bringing together prosecutors, police, sheriffs, and citizens groups to put the most dangerous offenders behind bars. We funded 200 new violent crime prosecutors. We charged a record number of criminal offenders. And last year, we prosecuted the most violent criminals ever in our history. And now, violent crime is way down. Murders in America's largest cities dropped by 6 percent between 2017 and 2018. But I do have to ask you: What the hell is going on in Chicago? What is going on? (Applause.) We could solve that problem. We would've been down even a lot more. And it's not a tough problem to solve. You got to let law enforcement do what they have to do. They'll solve the problem very quickly. Very quickly. (Applause.) We don't think enough about the victims. They're too worried about the people that cause the crime. It's got to stop. That thought process is no good. The number of police officers shot and killed in the line of duty last year, I'm so happy to report, is down 21 percent compared to the year before. (Applause.) And that was the year before I took office. One of the reasons is that we are supplying police with surplus military equipment, supplies, and gears that the previous administration refused to give up. This is surplus. This is extra. We don't need it. Great equipment. Sitting in warehouses all over the country. Billions of dollars of equipment that the military no longer needs or wants or uses, but the top of the line. Some of it has never been used , brand new , from vehicles to, essentially, supplies of all kind, including bulletproof vests. And rather than having it sit and draw dust, I had it distributed all over the country to our police departments. (Applause.) And that's why you see these numbers. It's a great thing. You know, a lot of being President is common sense, right? Don't you think? Right? Common sense. (Applause.) Have a good heart, but it's common sense. In this administration, we will always stand with the heroes of law enforcement. They're heroes. (Applause.) They're brave. They're great. And they will tell you they haven't felt so proud of themselves for many years, because they were abandoned by Washington. They were abandoned by our politicians. And not just the Obama administration , before that. They felt abandoned. Well, they know that I love them, and we're going to protect them just like they protect us. (Applause.) Incredible people. Great people. We've also taken critical steps to improve school safety. More than 30 states now allow teachers that are highly trained , highly trained, talented people , to carry guns in the classroom to protect themselves and to protect their students, who they love. (Applause.) Who's better? Who's better? I've been calling for that for the last two years, and I think we had a big impact. Some legislations passed, and they don't have the few paragraphs, and the legislators actually go back to governors and say, \"We're not passing it unless you allow that to happen.\" So we've come a long way. But who's better to protect our students than the teachers that love them? Through STOP School Violence grants, we are helping local schools and police departments to hire more officers, train more teachers, and address early warning signs of mental illness. (Applause.) Every day, citizens across America exercise their constitutional right to defend themselves, their families, and their communities. That's a constitutional right. (Applause.) They want to take it away from you. They will take it away. You let these maniacs get into office, they will take that right away. I mean, you see what's going on. \"Let the Boston bomber vote. He should be voting.\" Right? I don't think so. \"Let terrorists that are in prison vote.\" I don't think so. Can you believe it? But this is where some of these people are coming from. And they're the most popular ones. When Bernie Sanders made certain statements the other day, I said, \"Well, that's the end of his campaign.\" Then, what happened is everybody agreed with him. (Laughter.) Or most of them. We know that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. (Applause.) Now, I wanted to be a little bit more original than to use a phrase that you probably heard a thousand times. But what's a better phrase than that? We can't do better. How simple is that? Today, I want to give a few of these brave citizens the chance to share their stories directly with the American people. A lot of television back there. Of course, when I start going after them, you watch those red lights go off. They don't want any part of it. They turn those lights. Then they come back. They need the ratings. (Laughter and applause.) They come back. In fact, at a certain point, I think they'll probably all endorse me, because would they be dead without me? Can you imagine? Can you imagine having some nice, boring person get up here? Well, they wouldn't be up here. They would be as far away from you as possible. (Applause.) April Evans joins us from Virginia. One night in 2015, she was home alone with her two-year-old daughter when an intruder broke into her home violently. April took care of it. April, please come up. Please, April. (Applause.) MS. EVANS: My husband is a police officer and he works night shift. One night, he was at work, and my daughter and I were home alone. Someone started banging so hard on the door it broke in two places. He demanded that I let him in. I called 911 and I went to my room to get the gun. I heard a loud crash, and when I came out to the hallway to see, he was running towards me with a look in his eyes that I'll never forget. I shot him twice and I held him at gunpoint until the police arrived. (Applause.) This event was something that changed my life. I've never been more afraid but I've been standing strong. And I've told my story again and again, because with each person I told, they stood a little taller knowing that if I could protect myself and my family, that they could too. Protecting my family would not be possible without the right to bear arms. It's an issue that's obviously close to my heart. If these rights had been taken from us, I may not be standing here today and I may not have a healthy, now-six-year-old daughter. I'd like to thank you, Mr. President, for your unapologetic stance on our right to bear arms. I truly believe those rights saved my life and the life of my daughter that night. (Applause.) Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, April. She was able to defend herself. Also with us is Mark Vaughan, who owns a meat processing plant in Oklahoma. When an employee began attacking coworkers with a knife viciously and violently, Mark drew his gun and ended the assault immediately, saving countless innocent lives. Mark, please come up. (Applause.) MR. VAUGHAN: Thank you, Mr. President. Welcome all. I got a call late one Thursday afternoon while I sitting at my office. A frantic call from our customer service group said an attacker with a knife was victimizing people in our office. I ran to my vehicle, ran the 100 yards to the other end of our complex. It was a very chaotic scene: screaming, crying, blood everywhere. I immediately entered the building, ran down a hall , I immediately entered a building, ran down a hallway, and saw a man attacking a woman in the neck and head with a large knife. I yelled. He stopped, paused for a moment, and ran at full speed toward me. At about 18 feet, I fired three rounds from my AR-15 Carbine , (applause) , immediately incapacitating the subject. He was a determined attacker. Unbeknownst to me, moments before, he had decapitated a coworker and had targeted several others in our operation to be attacked that day. I was able to take that action because I had a gun and I was prepared to use it. These are central missions of the NRA. And I thank you, NRA, for that, and everyone here. (Applause.) We have but one true thing , one true mission before us today, and that's to come together like we never have before to preserve our foundational freedom to bear arms in the defense of ourselves, those we love, those we seek to protect, and most importantly, our liberty. Lastly, I'd like to express gratitude. No other President in our lifetime has stood with us so strongly in defense of our Second Amendment rights. Thank you, Mr. President. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mark. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Finally, Stephen Willeford joins us from Sutherland Springs, Texas , great state of Texas , (applause) , where a mass shooter opened fire at the First Baptist Church , you all read about it , in November 2017, taking many innocent lives. Wonderful, wonderful people. Stephen heroically risked his life to bring the horrible violence to an end. Stephen, please come up and say a few words. (Applause.) MR. WILLEFORD: I would like to thank, first, the NRA for this opportunity, and then I would like to thank our President for this opportunity. On November 5th, 2017, I was home because I normally started , I was going to start my on-call at the hospital, where I work as an emergency plumber during on-call and could be called lot. So I stayed home from church that day because I wanted to get rest. It wasn't to happen. My daughter came into my bedroom and said, \"Dad, doesn't that sound like gunfire to you?\" I ran to my window thinking it was someone tapping at the window. And she said, \"No, come into the kitchen,\" where I immediately said, \"It is gunfire.\" My daughter was an NRA distinguished expert when she was eight years old. (Applause.) All three of my children , my other daughter and my son , were NRA distinguished experts by the time they were eight years old. I was an NRA instructor. I ran to my safe, and my daughter ran outside , ran out to her car, got in the car, and ran reconnaissance for me. She ran up to the corner and came back while I was getting a gun out of my safe and loading it. And she said, \"Dad, there's a man in black tactical gear shooting up the church.\" And I said, \"Did you call 911?\" And she said, \"I did. They're aware of it.\" Right away, they told me police were coming but I couldn't wait. I couldn't wait. Our police department in Wilson County has some of the best officers in this world and they were racing as fast as they could, but my community couldn't wait for them. I ran out the door and I told my daughter to load another magazine for me because I gave her busy work. I didn't want her to be there if I failed. And I didn't want her to be there for a target for him. The Holy Spirit took over me at that moment. And as I ran across the street, I yelled out. The gunman heard me inside and so did some of the people from the church. So did my own daughter. He came running out of the church and started shooting at me. I put two shots center mass. He stopped shooting at me and ran to his vehicle. The two shots center mass , he had class III body armor on , they made no difference. But when he ran and turned around his door to his vehicle, I put one in his side and one in his legs. He got in his vehicle. He put two more shots through the side window. I put one where I perceived his head to be and shot through the window. He took off and ran away down the street, and I'm thinking, \"Oh, my God, he's getting away.\" I ran out into the street and took one more shot that went through his back window, penetrated the driver's side seat, and hit him just right of the left shoulder blade. He continued to run. I met up with a man that was just parked and watched the whole thing. And everybody in this world would have just driven on. But this is Texas. We are known for our sanity. (Laughter and applause.) I found out later his name is Johnny. And I got in the truck with Johnny and we gave chase. And at the end, the gunman, being the coward that he was, took his own life. Inside the church were more heroes than we can even talk about in our limited amount of time. But I'm here today to talk about the fact that I used my own AR-15 to confront a shooter that had dropped fifteen 30-round magazines in my church. He murdered 26 people and injured 20 more. There were only seven people that walked out of that church without a gunshot wound. If it were not for our Second Amendment rights, and the right to carry an AR-15, the same style gun that he had, then I would have been outgunned myself. (Applause.) And if it were not for God covering me and protecting me, I would not have been successful that day. I want to thank the NRA for being relentless in protecting our Second Amendment rights. And I would like to thank this President for defending the Second Amendment. And I would like to say today, he says, \"Make America great again.\" And he's including you. You will make America great again with him. But he needs you. He needs your vote. And if you do not get out there and vote for this man, then it's on you. Thank you very much to the NRA and thank you for President Donald Trump. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Wow, what a job. Thank you. Thank you. Can't say it better than that. But I want to thank you all for your courage, because you're really living proof that law-abiding gun owners make a tremendous, tremendous difference. Tremendous difference. You know, Paris, France, they say, has the strongest gun laws in the world. And you remember those maniacs, when they went into the nightclub. I use this example. There are many examples. But they shot one person, another person, another person, another person. Hundreds of people dead and horribly wounded to this day. That was five years ago. If there was one gun being carried by one person on the other side, it very well could have been a whole different result. The shooting went on so long and there wasn't a thing you could do about it. \"Get over here.\" Boom. \"Get over here.\" Boom. And then they left. They were captured later. If there was only one gun. If there were two, three, four, it wouldn't have happened. Tiny percentage, by comparison. But it probably wouldn't have happened because the cowards would've known there are people in there having guns. Wouldn't have happened. So people don't really understand the other side of the argument. I have the debate a lot, and I win the debate all the time. And the next day, you see the same person who was so badly defeated in the debate going out and saying the same thing, even though he or she, I really believe, know that you can't justify their side of the argument. So, gun owners make our communities safer and they make our nation stronger. Americans have always understood this truth, going back to the earliest days of our nation. Two months before the American Revolution broke out, with the shot heard around the world, a group of patriots gathered along a bridge in Salem, Massachusetts. In the preceding months, British soldiers had confiscated muskets in Boston. You know the story well. Gunpowder was seized in Somerville. And the patriots in Salem knew that the Redcoats would soon come for the town's cannons. But the Americans were prepared , they already loved our country , and they were determined to defend their rights to the death. When hundreds of British soldiers arrived at the bridge, the Americans stood firm, blocking their path. When swords were drawn, they didn't flinch. When the Redcoats tried to steal American boats, the patriots sank those boats and sank them very quickly. When a British soldier held the tip of his bayonet against a man's chest, that man , Joseph Whicher , tore open his shirt and dared him to do his worst. Soon, the crowd grew larger, as civilians came from miles around to stand side by side with their great countrymen against tyranny. In the face of such unbreakable resolve, the King's soldiers had no choice but to admit defeat and failure and retreat. In the courageous actions of those early Americans, we see the defiant and determined spirit of patriotism that has always willed America to its greatest victories. It is a spirit that is passed down from generation to generation, from fathers and mothers to sons and daughters. It is the spirit that lives in each and every one of you. Our duty, our responsibility, our sacred charge, is to preserve the freedoms that our ancestors gave their very lives to secure. Because no matter how many centuries go by, no matter how much the world changes, the central drama of human history remains the same. On one side are those who seek power, control, and domination. And on the other side are patriots like those in this hall who stand upright and plant their feet in eternal defense of our liberty. And with God as our witness, we swear today that we will defend our rights, we will safeguard our freedoms, we will uphold our heritage, we will protect our Constitution, and we will make America stronger, prouder, safer, and greater than ever, ever, ever before! (Applause.) To all of our incredible friends at the NRA: Thank you for fighting the good fight. It is an honor to fight by your side, and it's an honor to be with everyone in this giant hall today. I am with you. I will never, ever let you down. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1339032\/remarks-by-president-trump-at-the-nra-ila-leadership-forum&speechType=1","Summary":"National Security Guns Judicial Branch","Source":null,"Location":"Indianapolis, IN","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-nra-ila-leadership-forum-indianapolis\/","CleanText":"Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Well, I want to thank Chris and Wayne. I'm thrilled to be here in Indiana with the men and women of the NRA. You are great American patriots. (Applause.) Chris Cox, Wayne LaPierre, Oliver North , I've been following Oliver for a long time. Great guy. Three extraordinary champions for the Second Amendment. And I'm a champion for the Second Amendment and so are you. It's not going anywhere. (Applause.) It's under assault. It's under assault but not when we're here. Not even close. I also want to thank our tremendous Vice President and Indiana's native son. Mike Pence has done a fantastic job. (Applause.) And we're grateful to be joined by a number of terrific leaders from the Hoosier State: Governor Eric Holcomb. Where is Eric? You can't miss Eric. He's so big. (Applause.) Thank you, Eric. Senator Todd Young, terrific guy. (Applause.) Thank you, Todd. Senator Mike Braun. What a job he's doing. (Applause.) And Representative Greg Pence , familiar name. Thank you, Greg. (Applause.) Jackie Walorski. Jackie, thank you. (Applause.) Jim Baird and Jim Banks , great representatives. Thank you all very much. (Applause.) Tremendous help. Tremendous. I also want to recognize Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt. What a job he's been doing. David, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) A great friend of mine, Kentucky Governor, Matt Bevin. (Applause.) Thank you, Matt. And the House GOP Whip , a man with more courage than most of us here today. He took some very, very severe shots , you know that , by a madman. And he's stronger and better. I actually told him backstage, I said, 'You're much more handsome than you were two years ago.' I don't know what's going on. And he is. Steve Scalise. A lot of courage. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Steve. Most importantly, I want to thank all of you, the proud, card-carrying members of the NRA. (Applause.) Every day, you stand up for our God-given rights without exception, without fail, and without apology. Together, we are fighting for the timeless values that have built and sustained our nation. And our nation is greater today than it has ever been. Stronger, richer. We're doing better than ever before. We are great Americans. You're doing a great job. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. We believe in the rule of law. And we will always protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. (Applause.) And there are some people that are running right now; I don't think they have that number one on their list. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. (Applause.) And we believe in the right to self-defense and the right to protect your family, your community, and your loved ones. We believe in the wisdom of our Founders. And we believe in freedom and liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) We know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. And above all else, we know this: In America, we don't worship government; we worship God. (Applause.) Every day of my administration, we are taking power out of Washington, D.C. and returning it to the American people, where it belongs. (Applause.) And you see it now better than ever, with all of the resignations of all of the bad apples. They're bad apples. They tried for a coup; didn't work out so well. (Applause.) And I didn't need a gun for that one, did I? (Laughter.) All was taking place at the highest levels in Washington, D.C. You've been watching, you've been seeing. You've been looking at things that you wouldn't have believed possible in our country. Corruption at the highest level , a disgrace. Spying, surveillance, trying for an overthrow. And we caught them. We caught them. (Applause.) Who would have thought in our country? But it's called what we all together have done , started two and a half years ago on that great November 8th. That was a great day. Remember that day? (Applause.) Great day. And in a year and a half, we have one called 'November 3rd.' It's November 3rd this time. Get ready to vote. You better. You better get ready to vote. But it's all called 'draining the swamp,' and we are doing it faster than anyone ever thought possible. Very proud of that. (Applause.) And around the world, America is respected again because we are finally putting America first. Been a long time. Our economy is now the hottest anywhere on the planet Earth. Just this morning, we learned that the GDP smashed expectations, with the economy growing at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter , always the worst quarter for whatever reason. 3.2. (Applause.) And if we kept the same interest rates and the same quantitative easing that the previous administration had, that 3.2 would have been much higher than that. But they hadn't hit these numbers in 16 years. We had a tremendous increase in inventory investment. You know what that means. And , listen to this , a very big increase in net exports. Isn't it about time? Isn't that nice? (Applause.) We've added almost 6 million jobs since my election. And if I would have said that during the campaign, all of those people back there , we call them the 'fake news' , they wouldn't have believed it. They're fake. They're fake. Blue-collar jobs recently grew at the fastest rate in more than three decades. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps since our election. (Applause.) Wages are rising fast, and the lowest-paid workers are making the biggest percentage gains of all. And that's nice to hear. It's about time. (Applause.) Unemployment recently achieved its lowest rate in 51 years, and very shortly, it should be its lowest rate in the history of our country. (Applause.)African American, Asian American, Hispanic American , have reached the lowest levels of unemployment in our history. (Applause.) America's future has never been brighter, and yet Democrats have never been angrier, especially now that their 'collusion delusion' has been exposed to the world as a complete and total fraud. (Applause.) It's been the greatest political hoax ever in our country. Instead of working with us to rebuild our infrastructure, lower drug prices , which, by the way, this year, for the first time in 50 years, drug prices went down. (Applause.) They're going to go down a lot lower. And instead of working with us to fix our trade deals , which I'm doing without them , and continue creating millions and millions of new jobs, which we're doing at a level that people have not seen before, that people don't even believe, Democrats are obsessed with hoaxes, delusions, and witch hunts. It's what they're obsessed with. That's what they want to do. And we can play the game just as well or better than they do. (Applause.) Far-left radicals in Congress want to take away your voice, your jobs, your rights, and they especially want to take away your guns. You know that. They want to take away your guns. You better get out there and vote. You better get out there and vote. It seems like it's a long ways away. It's not. I was saying to Melania, our great First Lady, whose birthday it is today. Happy birthday, Melania! (Applause.) I remember standing, two and a half years ago, in the same hallway where Abraham Lincoln and so many others have stood. My first night in the White House and I said to Melania , I said, 'This is incredible.' And four years seemed so long away. And now here we are. We're getting ready to start up the campaign again. Start up the campaign again. (Applause.) I never want to do anything with MAGA because MAGA country and MAGA , 'Make America Great Again' has been great, but we've really made it great. We've made it great. We've brought it back. And we're thinking about , slogan: 'Keep America Great.' Because you have socialists and far-left Democrats that want to destroy everything that we've done. Your 401(k)s are going through the roof. Your stock market, since the election, has hit a record high. Almost a hundred different records I've broken. Record high. But everyone is like a genius now. They buy stock and they're all up. Everybody is benefitting and jobs are benefitting. But it can all be taken away when you start putting the wrong people in office. We've cut regulations more than any President in the history our country. And that's in two years. In two years, we did more to regulation , (applause) , think of that , than any President in the history of our country. It's one of the reasons our jobs are booming; one of the reasons the economy is booming. We gave you the largest tax cut in the history of our country. The biggest, ever. (Applause.) And we got ANWR approved. And we got the individual mandate, the absolute worst part of Obamacare, eliminated. Now we're going for the rest. (Applause.) And we had it done except for one vote. You know what I'm talking about. One vote. In recent days, leading Democrats have proposed banning new guns and confiscating existing guns from law-abiding citizens. What they don't tell you is the bad guys aren't giving up their guns. And you're not going to be giving up your guns either. (Applause.) At the same time, House Democrats recently voted against notifying ICE , these brave, great, talented, brilliant patriots , when an illegal alien attempts to buy a gun, which is a felony. Democrats also support sanctuary cities that release thousands of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. In fact, they like the criminal aliens and aliens so much that when we're forced to release them into our country because of the horrible immigration laws that the Democrats refuse to give us the votes , we need some of their votes to change , we give them as many as they can handle. (Applause.) And they're not too happy about it, folks. They're not too happy. They said, 'Who came up with that idea?' (Laughter.) They said, 'Only Trump could come up with that idea.' (Laughter and applause.) We give them as many as they can handle. In other words, Democrats want to disarm law-abiding Americans while allowing criminal aliens to operate with impunity. But that will never happen as long as I'm your President. Not even close. (Applause.) I promise to defend the Second Amendment rights of every American, and I always will. I'll never let you down. (Applause.) Never let you down. I haven't so far, and I won't. Because as the famous saying goes, when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Very simple. (Applause.) The Democrats are also working hard to block the wall, but we are building the wall. They're not happy about it. And we will have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. (Applause.) We're building a lot of wall, and I want to thank Border Patrol. I want to thank our great military. And I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers. They've been incredible. And we are doing something that I could do very quickly, and we're doing it very quickly. But dealing with these people is very, very difficult, if you haven't noticed, okay? Any politician would've given up a long time ago. So we'll have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. It's going up rapidly. Rapidly. (Applause.) We're also renovating tremendous stretches of wall. We have wall that's in bad shape but it's structurally sound. And rather than building new, we renovate it. We make it as good as new, save a lot of money, and we gain a lot of territory. So we have a lot of great things going. A lot of great things going. (Applause.) Most importantly, Democrats must change our immigration laws right now. Right now. We can do it in , I used to say 45 minutes. We can do it in 15 minutes. It's very simple. You know the programs; they're horrible. The asylum , where rough, tough MS-13 gang members come in. You don't want to meet with these people, but ICE doesn't mind because ICE is throwing them out of our country by the thousands. And the Democrats want to eliminate ICE. Can you believe that? (Applause.) Boy, oh, boy. But it's incredible what they've done. It's incredible what we've done. But they stand there , asylum , and they read a statement, 'I am afraid for my life. I am afraid to go back to my country. I want to be an American!' And you look and you see a toughness that you don't see. And you just see what happens with the mayor of Tijuana and others. They say, 'These people, we try and help them, and they start hitting us. They start punching us.' We don't want them in our country, and they're not getting into our country. And when they have in the past , a lot of them have come in , we're throwing them the hell out. They're out. We're getting them out. (Applause.) But we can fix the problem so easy. And when we fix the problem , the wall is one thing. And that will have an incredible impact. But they won't even be coming up if we change our old, broken, ridiculous, weak immigration laws. They won't even be coming up. They won't make the journey. The wall is still good to have. We need the wall. But all of those people you see coming up , thousands and thousands of people , they won't be coming because they're going to say, 'There's no way we can get into the United States anymore, except by going through legal channels.' And what we want is we want people. We need them for all of the great companies that are coming in. But people have to come into our country legally and through merit. Through merit. (Applause.) One of the gravest threats to the Second Amendment, and to American freedom itself, are activist judges. You see it every day. Every day. They almost always file in a certain little jurisdiction; I won't tell you what it is, but you all know. Every time we get sued on the ban, which we ended up winning , you know, we have the ban. We lost in the Ninth Circuit; we shouldn't have. We lost in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which we shouldn't have. And we won at the United States Supreme Court. So we have the ban. Travel ban. But the reporters , the other day, some reporter said, 'Donald Trump, who lost the travel ban ' I didn't lose it. Well, what he meant: I lost it in the Ninth Circuit. But he didn't say we won at the United States Supreme Court. So everybody said, 'Oh, that's too bad. He lost the ' No, no. We won the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court. (Applause.) But they don't say that. So when we confronted them, they said, 'No, we were referring to the lower courts.' I said, 'What about the upper court? They ruled. It's done.' 'Well, we weren't talking about the Supreme Court. We were saying you lost ' These are very, very dishonest people, okay? (Applause.) Nobody gets it. Why? They're opposed to strong military. They're opposed to all of the things we've done, including making our nation wealthy, including high GDPs, including all of the security and all of the law enforcement, all of the things we're doing. It's incredible. Nobody understands it. Someday, we're going to figure it out, and I'll feel much better about it. But why are they opposed to things that truly make our country great? Why? Nobody gets it. I don't get it. The level of dishonesty and corruption in the media is unbelievable. (Applause.) But we're stuck with activist judges who seek to rewrite our Constitution to force their own radical views onto our country.That is why my administration has led a historic effort to confirm fair and impartial and mostly conservative judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. (Applause.) And I'm very proud to announce that we will soon have 145 federal judges confirmed , a record number , including two great Supreme Court judges , (applause) , Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh. (Applause.) Two fantastic justices. In fact, next week, we will confirm our 100th federal judge. Nobody knows what that means. The percentage is incredible. Nobody knows what that means. And in the end, I expect to have the second-highest percentage of judges confirmed in the history of the United States , more than any other President, except one , I'll never beat this one , percentage of judges approved. You know who the one is? Take a guess. George Washington. He gets 100 percent. (Applause.) No, he had 100 percent. He named every one of them. But you know what? We'll have more of them. George Washington. But we're also defending free speech on our college campuses. (Applause.) Last month, I signed an executive order requiring public colleges and universities to respect the First Amendment rights of their students, or risk losing tens of billions of dollars in federal funding. If you don't want to hear another voice, you don't get all of this tremendous amount , in some cases, ridiculous amounts of dollars. (Applause.) And we have shut down the previous administration's massive abuse of power known as Operation Choke Point. (Applause.) Under this ill-advised program, government bureaucrats discouraged banks from making loans to gun retailers , a backdoor attack on private gun ownership that will never be allowed to happen on my watch. That's step one, folks. (Applause.) Step one. You know what step two, three, and four is. Step four is: You don't have guns. You don't have any way to protect yourself. Today, I'm proud to announce another historic step to protect your Second Amendment rights. And I didn't tell Chris and Wayne and Oliver; I didn't even tell them about it. So they're listening in this big room someplace, and they're saying,'I wonder what he's going to do.' The good thing with me: You never know. (Laughter and applause.) Never know. That's why we're making trade deals that are so good for our country. So, in the last administration, President Obama signed the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. And in his waning days in office, he sent the treaty to the Senate to begin the ratification process. This treaty threatened your subjugate , and you know exactly what's going on here , your rights and your constitutional and international rules and restrictions and regulations. Under my administration, we will never surrender American sovereignty to anyone. (Applause.) We will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedom. And that is why my administration will never ratify the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. I hope you're happy. (Applause.) I'm impressed; I didn't think too many of you would really know what it is. You what it is? A big, big factor. But I see a couple of very happy faces from the NRA over there. And I am officially announcing today that the United States will be revoking the effect of America's signature from this badly misguided treatment . We're taking our signature back. (Applause.) The United Nations will soon receive a formal notice that America is rejecting this treaty. (Applause.) As part of this decision, I will sign right now, in front of a lot of witnesses , a lot , (applause) , it's a lot of witnesses , a message asking the Senate to discontinue the treaty ratification process and to return the now-rejected treaty right back to me, in the Oval Office, where I will dispose of it. (Applause.) By taking these actions, we are reaffirming that American liberty is sacred and that American citizens live by American laws, not the laws of foreign countries. Thank you. (Applause.) They all want the pen. Can you believe these people? (Laughter.) Should I give it to them? Famous pen. As we protect gun rights for law-abiding citizens, we are also getting guns out of the hands of violent criminals. When I took office two years ago, one of my highest priorities was to reduce violent crime. In the two years before my inauguration, the murder rate had increased by more than 20 percent, and the United States had experienced the largest increase in violent crime in over 25 years. For this reason, my administration resurrected Project Safe Neighborhoods, bringing together prosecutors, police, sheriffs, and citizens groups to put the most dangerous offenders behind bars. We funded 200 new violent crime prosecutors. We charged a record number of criminal offenders. And last year, we prosecuted the most violent criminals ever in our history. And now, violent crime is way down. Murders in America's largest cities dropped by 6 percent between 2017 and 2018. But I do have to ask you: What the hell is going on in Chicago? What is going on? (Applause.) We could solve that problem. We would've been down even a lot more. And it's not a tough problem to solve. You got to let law enforcement do what they have to do. They'll solve the problem very quickly. Very quickly. (Applause.) We don't think enough about the victims. They're too worried about the people that cause the crime. It's got to stop. That thought process is no good. The number of police officers shot and killed in the line of duty last year, I'm so happy to report, is down 21 percent compared to the year before. (Applause.) And that was the year before I took office. One of the reasons is that we are supplying police with surplus military equipment, supplies, and gears that the previous administration refused to give up. This is surplus. This is extra. We don't need it. Great equipment. Sitting in warehouses all over the country. Billions of dollars of equipment that the military no longer needs or wants or uses, but the top of the line. Some of it has never been used , brand new , from vehicles to, essentially, supplies of all kind, including bulletproof vests. And rather than having it sit and draw dust, I had it distributed all over the country to our police departments. (Applause.) And that's why you see these numbers. It's a great thing. You know, a lot of being President is common sense, right? Don't you think? Right? Common sense. (Applause.) Have a good heart, but it's common sense. In this administration, we will always stand with the heroes of law enforcement. They're heroes. (Applause.) They're brave. They're great. And they will tell you they haven't felt so proud of themselves for many years, because they were abandoned by Washington. They were abandoned by our politicians. And not just the Obama administration , before that. They felt abandoned. Well, they know that I love them, and we're going to protect them just like they protect us. (Applause.) Incredible people. Great people. We've also taken critical steps to improve school safety. More than 30 states now allow teachers that are highly trained , highly trained, talented people , to carry guns in the classroom to protect themselves and to protect their students, who they love. (Applause.) Who's better? Who's better? I've been calling for that for the last two years, and I think we had a big impact. Some legislations passed, and they don't have the few paragraphs, and the legislators actually go back to governors and say, 'We're not passing it unless you allow that to happen.' So we've come a long way. But who's better to protect our students than the teachers that love them? Through STOP School Violence grants, we are helping local schools and police departments to hire more officers, train more teachers, and address early warning signs of mental illness. (Applause.) Every day, citizens across America exercise their constitutional right to defend themselves, their families, and their communities. That's a constitutional right. (Applause.) They want to take it away from you. They will take it away. You let these maniacs get into office, they will take that right away. I mean, you see what's going on. 'Let the Boston bomber vote. He should be voting.' Right? I don't think so. 'Let terrorists that are in prison vote.' I don't think so. Can you believe it? But this is where some of these people are coming from. And they're the most popular ones. When Bernie Sanders made certain statements the other day, I said, 'Well, that's the end of his campaign.' Then, what happened is everybody agreed with him. (Laughter.) Or most of them. We know that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. (Applause.) Now, I wanted to be a little bit more original than to use a phrase that you probably heard a thousand times. But what's a better phrase than that? We can't do better. How simple is that? Today, I want to give a few of these brave citizens the chance to share their stories directly with the American people. A lot of television back there. Of course, when I start going after them, you watch those red lights go off. They don't want any part of it. They turn those lights. Then they come back. They need the ratings. (Laughter and applause.) They come back. In fact, at a certain point, I think they'll probably all endorse me, because would they be dead without me? Can you imagine? Can you imagine having some nice, boring person get up here? Well, they wouldn't be up here. They would be as far away from you as possible. (Applause.) April Evans joins us from Virginia. One night in 2015, she was home alone with her two-year-old daughter when an intruder broke into her home violently. April took care of it. April, please come up. Please, April. (Applause.) Thank you, April. She was able to defend herself. Also with us is Mark Vaughan, who owns a meat processing plant in Oklahoma. When an employee began attacking coworkers with a knife viciously and violently, Mark drew his gun and ended the assault immediately, saving countless innocent lives. Mark, please come up. (Applause.) Thank you, Mark. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Finally, Stephen Willeford joins us from Sutherland Springs, Texas , great state of Texas , (applause) , where a mass shooter opened fire at the First Baptist Church , you all read about it , in November 2017, taking many innocent lives. Wonderful, wonderful people. Stephen heroically risked his life to bring the horrible violence to an end. Stephen, please come up and say a few words. (Applause.) Wow, what a job. Thank you. Thank you. Can't say it better than that. But I want to thank you all for your courage, because you're really living proof that law-abiding gun owners make a tremendous, tremendous difference. Tremendous difference. You know, Paris, France, they say, has the strongest gun laws in the world. And you remember those maniacs, when they went into the nightclub. I use this example. There are many examples. But they shot one person, another person, another person, another person. Hundreds of people dead and horribly wounded to this day. That was five years ago. If there was one gun being carried by one person on the other side, it very well could have been a whole different result. The shooting went on so long and there wasn't a thing you could do about it. 'Get over here.' Boom. 'Get over here.' Boom. And then they left. They were captured later. If there was only one gun. If there were two, three, four, it wouldn't have happened. Tiny percentage, by comparison. But it probably wouldn't have happened because the cowards would've known there are people in there having guns. Wouldn't have happened. So people don't really understand the other side of the argument. I have the debate a lot, and I win the debate all the time. And the next day, you see the same person who was so badly defeated in the debate going out and saying the same thing, even though he or she, I really believe, know that you can't justify their side of the argument. So, gun owners make our communities safer and they make our nation stronger. Americans have always understood this truth, going back to the earliest days of our nation. Two months before the American Revolution broke out, with the shot heard around the world, a group of patriots gathered along a bridge in Salem, Massachusetts. In the preceding months, British soldiers had confiscated muskets in Boston. You know the story well. Gunpowder was seized in Somerville. And the patriots in Salem knew that the Redcoats would soon come for the town's cannons. But the Americans were prepared , they already loved our country , and they were determined to defend their rights to the death. When hundreds of British soldiers arrived at the bridge, the Americans stood firm, blocking their path. When swords were drawn, they didn't flinch. When the Redcoats tried to steal American boats, the patriots sank those boats and sank them very quickly. When a British soldier held the tip of his bayonet against a man's chest, that man , Joseph Whicher , tore open his shirt and dared him to do his worst. Soon, the crowd grew larger, as civilians came from miles around to stand side by side with their great countrymen against tyranny. In the face of such unbreakable resolve, the King's soldiers had no choice but to admit defeat and failure and retreat. In the courageous actions of those early Americans, we see the defiant and determined spirit of patriotism that has always willed America to its greatest victories. It is a spirit that is passed down from generation to generation, from fathers and mothers to sons and daughters. It is the spirit that lives in each and every one of you. Our duty, our responsibility, our sacred charge, is to preserve the freedoms that our ancestors gave their very lives to secure. Because no matter how many centuries go by, no matter how much the world changes, the central drama of human history remains the same. On one side are those who seek power, control, and domination. And on the other side are patriots like those in this hall who stand upright and plant their feet in eternal defense of our liberty. And with God as our witness, we swear today that we will defend our rights, we will safeguard our freedoms, we will uphold our heritage, we will protect our Constitution, and we will make America stronger, prouder, safer, and greater than ever, ever, ever before! (Applause.) To all of our incredible friends at the NRA: Thank you for fighting the good fight. It is an honor to fight by your side, and it's an honor to be with everyone in this giant hall today. I am with you. I will never, ever let you down. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)"}

We look forward to that tomorrow. I want to thank our magnificent First Lady, Melania, for hosting this beautiful event. Thank you. (Applause.) And we are also very honored to have with us our great Vice President, Mike Pence. Mike? Mike, how are you? (Applause.) And Second Lady Karen Pence, who works so hard and does such a great job. Thank you, Karen. (Applause.) Also thanks to Ben Carson and Secretary Sonny Perdue for being with us. You're always with us and we appreciate it very much. Thank you. Thank you both very much. (Applause.) And very special , we're proudly joined by leaders representing many of the world's great faiths: Christians, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Hindus. Tonight, we break bread together, united by our love of God, and we renew our resolve to protect the sacred freedom of religion. All of us. (Applause.) In recent weeks, people of faith around the world have faced terrible hardship. All of us in this room send our love and prayers to the Jewish Americans wounded at the Chabad of Poway shooting in California. So tragic. So horrible. And our hearts break for the life of Lori Gilbert-Kaye, who was so wickedly taken from us. We mourn for the Christians murdered in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, and grieve for the Muslims murdered at their mosques in New Zealand. Here at home, we also remember the three historically black churches burned recently in Louisiana, and the horrific shooting last year at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Violence and terrorism against people of all faiths must end and it must end now. (Applause.) All civilized nations must join together in this effort. In our own country, we must always protect the religious liberty enshrined in our Constitution and in our lives , in our lives. It's so important for us all. I'm thrilled to report that tomorrow the Senate will confirm the 100th federal judge to the court system. Under my administration, we're getting to a level where we're going to be breaking records, with respect to the judiciary , which means a lot for the people in this room because you were treated very poorly, but now you're , (applause) , with time, you'll see what happens. And we'll have close to 145 very shortly. One hundred and forty-five federal judges, including two great Supreme Court judges and , Justices of the Supreme Court. So I think it's something that was long overdue. And I think we're going to be treated very, very fairly. Very important. During this holy season, when Christians celebrate Easter, Jews mark the Passover, and Muslims prepare for Ramadan, we're reminded of how blessed we are to inherit the traditions of freedom and religious tolerance that have defined America from the beginning. When we embrace the fullness of our faiths, we become better friends, better neighbors, better citizens, and better people. America is forever. We will be a nation that believes forever. And we certainly believe, more than anyone, the power of prayer , the most powerful thing there is. From our earliest history, we've always been people of faith. Our Declaration of Independence proclaims that our rights are bestowed on us by our Creator. The First Continental Congress began with a prayer. Our first President, George Washington, declared a national day of thanksgiving to our Father in Heaven. Each time we pledge allegiance to our flag, we say that we are \"one Nation under God.\" And for 67 years, Presidents have proclaimed a National Day of Prayer. Sixty-seven years. Half a mile from where we are gathered this evening stands the Washington Monument. On the very top of the tallest structure in our nation's capital, facing the rising sun each morning, two Latin words are prescribed and inscribed. It's called, \"Praise be to God.\" Very important. And, by the way, you're seeing it more and more. You're seeing people prouder and prouder. It's happening. We remember , (applause) , remember when we started our campaign? I was saying, \"We're going to be saying \"Merry Christmas' again.\" Now everyone is very proud to be saying \"Merry Christmas\" again. (Laughter.) There was a time when we went shopping and you wouldn't see \"Merry Christmas\" on the stores. You'd see a red wall and it wouldn't say that; it would say \"Happy Holidays\" or something, but it wouldn't say \"Merry Christmas.\" We're back to saying \"Merry Christmas\" again in this country. And that's something that I consider a great achievement because it really spells out what's happening. (Applause.) So tonight, we praise God for our nation. We give thanks for His providence. We ask Him to watch over and protect the lives of religious believers, and the people of goodwill all over the world, and the people in this room, who are so important to so many different religions. And we pray that He will continue to bless America with faith, freedom, and peace. So thank you for coming to the White House. It is a great honor for Melania and myself to be with you. Great for Mike and Karen, and all of the wonderful representatives of our country. And you're the representatives of our faiths. And thank you very much. Very, very important day. And we're going to have something incredibly successful tomorrow. And we look forward to being with you. Thank you all for being here. Thank you very much. (Applause.)

When we embrace the fullness of our faiths, we become better friends, better neighbors, better citizens, and better people. America is forever. We will be a nation that believes forever. And we certainly believe, more than anyone, the power of prayer , the most powerful thing there is. From our earliest history, we've always been people of faith. Our Declaration of Independence proclaims that our rights are bestowed on us by our Creator. The First Continental Congress began with a prayer. Our first President, George Washington, declared a national day of thanksgiving to our Father in Heaven. Each time we pledge allegiance to our flag, we say that we are 'one Nation under God.' And for 67 years, Presidents have proclaimed a National Day of Prayer. Sixty-seven years. Half a mile from where we are gathered this evening stands the Washington Monument. On the very top of the tallest structure in our nation's capital, facing the rising sun each morning, two Latin words are prescribed and inscribed. It's called, 'Praise be to God.' Very important. And, by the way, you're seeing it more and more. You're seeing people prouder and prouder. It's happening. We remember , (applause) , remember when we started our campaign? I was saying, 'We're going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again.' Now everyone is very proud to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again. (Laughter.) There was a time when we went shopping and you wouldn't see 'Merry Christmas' on the stores. You'd see a red wall and it wouldn't say that; it would say 'Happy Holidays' or something, but it wouldn't say 'Merry Christmas.' We're back to saying 'Merry Christmas' again in this country. And that's something that I consider a great achievement because it really spells out what's happening. (Applause.) So tonight, we praise God for our nation. We give thanks for His providence. We ask Him to watch over and protect the lives of religious believers, and the people of goodwill all over the world, and the people in this room, who are so important to so many different religions. And we pray that He will continue to bless America with faith, freedom, and peace. So thank you for coming to the White House. It is a great honor for Melania and myself to be with you. Great for Mike and Karen, and all of the wonderful representatives of our country. And you're the representatives of our faiths. And thank you very much. Very, very important day. And we're going to have something incredibly successful tomorrow. And we look forward to being with you. Thank you all for being here. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you."}

Our hearts are filled with the grief for Muslims who were killed in their mosques in New Zealand, as well as the Christians, Jews, and other children of God who were slain in Sri Lanka, California, and Pittsburgh. In their blessed memory, we resolve to defeat the evils of terrorism and religious persecution so that all people can worship without fear, pray without danger, and live by the faith that flows from their heart. We thank God that America is a place founded on the belief that citizens of all faiths can live together in safety and live together in freedom.

{"SpeechID":"VSDT1652019501","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2019-05-16","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump on Modernizing Our Immigration System for a Stronger America","Type":"speech","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Please. Thank you. Thank you very much. We're here on this very beautiful spring day in the Rose Garden to unveil our plan to create a fair, modern, and lawful system of immigration for the United States. And it's about time. (Applause.) If adopted, our plan will transform America's immigration system into the pride of our nation and the envy of the modern world. Our proposal builds upon our nation's rich history of immigration, while strengthening the bonds of citizenship that bind us together as a national family. Throughout our history, we have proudly welcomed newcomers to our shores. Out of many people, from many places, we have forged one people and one nation under God, and we're very proud of it. (Applause.) We share the same home, we share the same destiny, and we pledge allegiance to the same, great American flag. (Applause.) Our policies have turbo-charged our economy. Now, we must implement an immigration system that will allow our citizens to prosper for generations to come. Today, we are presenting a clear contrast: Democrats are proposing open borders, lower wages, and, frankly, lawless chaos. We are proposing an immigration plan that puts the jobs, wages, and safety of American workers first. (Applause.) Our proposal is pro-American, pro-immigrant, and pro-worker. It's just common sense. It will help all of our people, including millions of devoted immigrants, to achieve the American Dream. We are grateful to be joined this afternoon by a tremendous number of people from the House, the Senate, and my Cabinet. And I love you all, but I won't introduce you all because I'll be here all day long. (Laughter.) But you're all here. Our plan achieves two critical goals. First, it stops illegal immigration and fully secures the border. And, second, it establishes a new legal immigration system that protects American wages, promotes American values, and attracts the best and brightest from all around the world. The proposal begins with the most complete and effective border security package ever assembled by our country , or any other country, for that matter. (Applause.) It's so important. This plan was not developed, I'm sorry to say, by politicians. We have a lot of politicians. But you respect the people and you know the people that have developed this plan. It was designed with significant input from our great law enforcement professionals to detail what they need to make our border , which is 100 percent operationally secure. One hundred percent. Everyone agrees that the physical infrastructure on the border and the ports of entry is gravely underfunded and woefully inadequate. We scan only a small fraction of the vehicles, goods, and all of the other things coming across, including people. And, sadly, the drugs pour across our border. We're going to stop it. Investment in technology will ensure we can scan 100 percent of everything coming through, curbing the flow of drugs and contraband, while speeding up legal trade and commerce. It's the most heavily traded , monetarily , border anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. To make certain that we are constantly making the upgrades we need, our proposal creates a permanent and self-sustaining border security trust fund. This will be financed by the fees and revenues generated at the border crossings itself. Importantly, we're already building the wall, and we should have close to 400 miles built by the end of next year, and probably even more than that. It's going up very rapidly. (Applause.) And I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers. They're doing a fantastic job on the wall. And that's a wall that is desperately needed. As we close the gaps in our physical framework, we must also close the gaps in our legal framework. Critical to ending the border crisis is removing all incentives for smuggling women and children. Current law , (applause). That's right. That's right. Women and children. People have no idea how bad it is unless you're there, and unless you are a member of law enforcement. They see it every day, and they can't believe what they see. Current law and federal court rulings encourage criminal organizations to smuggle children across the border. The tragic result is that 65 percent of all border-crossers this year were either minors or adults traveling with minors. Our plan will change the law to stop the flood of child smuggling and to humanely reunite unaccompanied children with their families back home , and rapidly. As soon as possible. (Applause.) We must also restore the integrity of our broken asylum system. Our nation has a proud history of affording protection to those fleeing government persecutions. Unfortunately, legitimate asylum seekers are being displaced by those lodging frivolous claims , these are frivolous claims , to gain admission into our country. Asylum abuse also strains our public school systems, our hospitals, and local shelters, using funds that we should, and that have to, go to elderly veterans, at-risk youth, Americans in poverty, and those in genuine need of protection. We're using the funds that should be going to them. And that shouldn't happen. And it's not going to happen in a very short period of time. Have to get this approved. My plan expedites relief for legitimate asylum seekers by screening out the meritless claims. If you have a proper claim, you will quickly be admitted; if you don't, you will promptly be returned home. Crucially , (applause) , our plan closes loopholes in federal law to make clear that gang members and criminals are inadmissible. These are some of the worst people anywhere in the world , MS-13 and others. Inadmissible. Not coming in. We're taking them out all the time by the thousands, a year, but they come in. They are no longer admissible. And for criminals already here, we will ensure their swift deportation. (Applause.) We will keep our communities safe. Americans can have complete and total confidence that under this plan, the borders will finally be fully and totally secured. (Applause.) And I know a number of our Republican friends and others , Lindsey, I see you sitting right there, and Steve, you're working on a plan , an immediate plan. A smaller plan, but a very immediate plan to stop it as of this afternoon. So, as fast as you can get something done. This is the big, beautiful, bold plan, but we need something very quickly. And if you can get it done, that would be fantastic. Okay? Thank you. (Applause.) Appreciate you working on it. A topic of less discussion in national media, but of vital importance to our country, is our legal immigration system itself. Our plan includes a sweeping modernization of our dysfunctional legal immigration process. It is totally dysfunctional. The system will finally be fair, transparent, and promote equality and opportunity for all. Every year, we admit 1.1 million immigrants as permanent legal residents. These green card holders get lifetime authorization to live and work here and a five-year path to American citizenship. This is the most prized citizenship anywhere in the world, by far. Currently, 66 percent of legal immigrants come here on the basis of random chance. They're admitted solely because they have a relative in the United States. And it doesn't really matter who that relative is. Another 21 percent of immigrants are issued either by random lottery, or because they are fortunate enough to be selected for humanitarian relief. Random selection is contrary to American values and blocks out many qualified potential immigrants from around the world who have much to contribute. While countless , and you wouldn't believe how many countries, like Canada, create a clear path for top talent. America does not. Under the senseless rules of the current system, we're not able to give preference to a doctor, a researcher, a student who graduated number one in his class from the finest colleges in the world , anybody. We're not able to take care of it. We're not able to make those incredible breakthroughs. If somebody graduates top of their class from the best college, sorry, go back to your country. We want to keep them here. Companies are moving offices to other countries because our immigration rules prevent them from retaining highly skilled and even, if I might, totally brilliant people. We discriminate against genius. We discriminate against brilliance. We won't anymore, once we get this passed. And we hope to get it passed as soon as possible. (Applause.) Some of the most skilled students at our world-class universities are going back home because they have no relatives to sponsor them here in the United States. And that's the only way. We want these exceptional students and workers to stay, and flourish, and thrive in America. (Applause.) Thank you. As a result of our broken rules, the annual green card flow is mostly low-wage and low-skilled. Newcomers compete for jobs against the most vulnerable Americans and put pressure on our social safety net and generous welfare programs. Only 12 percent of legal immigrants are selected based on skill or based on merit. In countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand , and others , that number is closer to 60 and even 70 and 75 percent, in some cases. The biggest change we make is to increase the proportion of highly skilled immigration from 12 percent to 57 percent, and we'd like to even see if we can go higher. (Applause.) This will bring us in line with other countries and make us globally competitive. At the same time, we prioritize the immediate family of new Americans , spouses and children. The loved ones you choose to build a life with, we prioritize. And we have to do that. They go right to the front of the line. Right to the front of the line, where they should be. (Applause.) America's last major overhaul of our legal admissions policy was 54 years ago. Think of that. So a major update , and that's what this is: merit system and a heart system , is long overdue. The millions of legal immigrants who have come to America over the past half century are now cherished members of our national family. Going forward , (applause) , it is their interest, and in their interest, and their children's interest, to adopt a green card system that promotes a rising standard of living for all of our citizens. Three in four new jobs at the end of last year went to Americans previously out of the workforce. Our economy is better probably than it ever has been in the history of our country. (Applause.) And because of that great economy, we're able to do things that nobody ever thought possible before, and that's what we're going to do for immigration, finally. Wages are rising but our current immigration system works at cross-purposes, placing downward pressure on wages for the working class, which is what we don't want to do. Last year, we also passed historic criminal justice reform. (Applause.) And we had tremendous backing , bipartisan , from Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals. I guess we could also use the word \"progressives.\" A new word that's come about. Americans with criminal records are getting a second chance at life in higher numbers than ever before. Unfortunately, the current immigration rules allow foreign workers to substitute for Americans seeking entry-level jobs. So, foreign workers are coming in and they're taking the jobs that would normally go to American workers. America's immigration system should bring in people who will expand opportunity for striving, low-income Americans, not to compete with those low-income Americans. (Applause.) Our proposal fulfills our sacred duty to those living here today, while ensuring America remains a welcoming country to immigrants joining us tomorrow. And we want immigrants coming in. We cherish the open door that we want to create for our country, but a big proportion of those immigrants must come in through merit and skill. (Applause.) The White House plan makes no change to the number of green cards allocated each year. But instead of admitting people through random chance, we will establish simple, universal criteria for admission to the United States. No matter where in the world you're born, no matter who your relatives are, if you want to become an American citizen, it will be clear exactly what standard we ask you to achieve. It will be made crystal clear. (Applause.) This will increase the diversity of immigration flows into our country. We will replace the existing green card categories with a new visa, the Build America visa , which is what we all want to hear. (Applause.) Like Canada and so many other modern countries, we create an easy-to-navigate points-based selection system. You will get more points for being a younger worker, meaning you will contribute more to our social safety net. You will get more points for having a valuable skill, an offer of employment, an advanced education, or a plan to create jobs. We lose people that want to start companies, and, in many cases, they're forced to leave our country; go back, usually, to the country where they came from; and they'll start up companies, and some of those companies are among the biggest and most successful companies today in the world. They could've started them right here in the United States, where they wanted to do it in the first place. Now they'll have a chance. (Applause.) Priority will also be given to higher-wage workers, ensuring we never undercut American labor. To protect benefits for American citizens, immigrants must be financially self-sufficient. Finally, to promote integration, assimilation, and national unity, future immigrants will be required to learn English and to pass a civics exam prior to admission. (Applause.) Through these steps, we will deliver an immigration system that respects, and even strengthens, our culture, our traditions, and our values. Four months ago, I had the honor of participating in a swearing-in ceremony for new Americans, right here in the Oval Office. It was a beautiful reminder that American citizenship is the most precious gift our nation has to offer. When we swear in new citizens, we do more than give them a permit; we give them a history, a heritage, a home, and a future of limitless possibilities and potential. Our nation used to pride ourselves on this capacity: our unique ability to instill the spirit of America into any human heart, into any human being. Many of the Democrats have claimed to be for these concepts at different times in their careers and, in many cases, in very recent history. And I hope that they will end up joining me and all of the people gathered together today in putting politics aside, putting security and wages first, and pursuing these historic reforms. It's time. (Applause.) And if for some reason , possibly political , we can't get the Democrats to approve this merit-based, high-security plan, then we will get it approved immediately after the election, when we take back the House, keep the Senate, and, of course, hold the presidency. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. But wouldn't it be nice to do it sooner than that? (Laughter.) But it's not a very long time, is it? Sixteen months. One of the reasons we will win is because of our strong, fair, and pro-America immigration policy. It's time to restore our national unity and reaffirm our national purpose. It is time to rebuild our country for all Americans. Together, we will create an immigration system to make America safer, and stronger, and greater than ever before. Thank you. God bless you all. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you.

And I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers. They're doing a fantastic job on the wall. And that's a wall that is desperately needed. As we close the gaps in our physical framework, we must also close the gaps in our legal framework. Critical to ending the border crisis is removing all incentives for smuggling women and children. Current law , (applause). That's right. That's right. Women and children. People have no idea how bad it is unless you're there, and unless you are a member of law enforcement. They see it every day, and they can't believe what they see. Current law and federal court rulings encourage criminal organizations to smuggle children across the border. The tragic result is that 65 percent of all border-crossers this year were either minors or adults traveling with minors. Our plan will change the law to stop the flood of child smuggling and to humanely reunite unaccompanied children with their families back home , and rapidly. As soon as possible. (Applause.) We must also restore the integrity of our broken asylum system. Our nation has a proud history of affording protection to those fleeing government persecutions. Unfortunately, legitimate asylum seekers are being displaced by those lodging frivolous claims , these are frivolous claims , to gain admission into our country. Asylum abuse also strains our public school systems, our hospitals, and local shelters, using funds that we should, and that have to, go to elderly veterans, at-risk youth, Americans in poverty, and those in genuine need of protection. We're using the funds that should be going to them. And that shouldn't happen. And it's not going to happen in a very short period of time. Have to get this approved. My plan expedites relief for legitimate asylum seekers by screening out the meritless claims. If you have a proper claim, you will quickly be admitted; if you don't, you will promptly be returned home. Crucially , (applause) , our plan closes loopholes in federal law to make clear that gang members and criminals are inadmissible. These are some of the worst people anywhere in the world , MS-13 and others. Inadmissible. Not coming in. We're taking them out all the time by the thousands, a year, but they come in. They are no longer admissible. And for criminals already here, we will ensure their swift deportation. (Applause.) We will keep our communities safe. Americans can have complete and total confidence that under this plan, the borders will finally be fully and totally secured. (Applause.) And I know a number of our Republican friends and others , Lindsey, I see you sitting right there, and Steve, you're working on a plan , an immediate plan. A smaller plan, but a very immediate plan to stop it as of this afternoon. So, as fast as you can get something done. This is the big, beautiful, bold plan, but we need something very quickly. And if you can get it done, that would be fantastic. Okay? Thank you. (Applause.) Appreciate you working on it. A topic of less discussion in national media, but of vital importance to our country, is our legal immigration system itself. Our plan includes a sweeping modernization of our dysfunctional legal immigration process. It is totally dysfunctional. The system will finally be fair, transparent, and promote equality and opportunity for all. Every year, we admit 1.1 million immigrants as permanent legal residents. These green card holders get lifetime authorization to live and work here and a five-year path to American citizenship. This is the most prized citizenship anywhere in the world, by far. Currently, 66 percent of legal immigrants come here on the basis of random chance. They're admitted solely because they have a relative in the United States. And it doesn't really matter who that relative is. Another 21 percent of immigrants are issued either by random lottery, or because they are fortunate enough to be selected for humanitarian relief. Random selection is contrary to American values and blocks out many qualified potential immigrants from around the world who have much to contribute. While countless , and you wouldn't believe how many countries, like Canada, create a clear path for top talent. America does not. Under the senseless rules of the current system, we're not able to give preference to a doctor, a researcher, a student who graduated number one in his class from the finest colleges in the world , anybody. We're not able to take care of it. We're not able to make those incredible breakthroughs. If somebody graduates top of their class from the best college, sorry, go back to your country. We want to keep them here. Companies are moving offices to other countries because our immigration rules prevent them from retaining highly skilled and even, if I might, totally brilliant people. We discriminate against genius. We discriminate against brilliance. We won't anymore, once we get this passed. And we hope to get it passed as soon as possible. (Applause.) Some of the most skilled students at our world-class universities are going back home because they have no relatives to sponsor them here in the United States. And that's the only way. We want these exceptional students and workers to stay, and flourish, and thrive in America. (Applause.) Thank you. As a result of our broken rules, the annual green card flow is mostly low-wage and low-skilled. Newcomers compete for jobs against the most vulnerable Americans and put pressure on our social safety net and generous welfare programs. Only 12 percent of legal immigrants are selected based on skill or based on merit. In countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand , and others , that number is closer to 60 and even 70 and 75 percent, in some cases. The biggest change we make is to increase the proportion of highly skilled immigration from 12 percent to 57 percent, and we'd like to even see if we can go higher. (Applause.) This will bring us in line with other countries and make us globally competitive. At the same time, we prioritize the immediate family of new Americans , spouses and children. The loved ones you choose to build a life with, we prioritize. And we have to do that. They go right to the front of the line. Right to the front of the line, where they should be. (Applause.) America's last major overhaul of our legal admissions policy was 54 years ago. Think of that. So a major update , and that's what this is: merit system and a heart system , is long overdue. The millions of legal immigrants who have come to America over the past half century are now cherished members of our national family. Going forward , (applause) , it is their interest, and in their interest, and their children's interest, to adopt a green card system that promotes a rising standard of living for all of our citizens. Three in four new jobs at the end of last year went to Americans previously out of the workforce. Our economy is better probably than it ever has been in the history of our country. (Applause.) And because of that great economy, we're able to do things that nobody ever thought possible before, and that's what we're going to do for immigration, finally. Wages are rising but our current immigration system works at cross-purposes, placing downward pressure on wages for the working class, which is what we don't want to do. Last year, we also passed historic criminal justice reform. (Applause.) And we had tremendous backing , bipartisan , from Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals. I guess we could also use the word 'progressives.' A new word that's come about. Americans with criminal records are getting a second chance at life in higher numbers than ever before. Unfortunately, the current immigration rules allow foreign workers to substitute for Americans seeking entry-level jobs. So, foreign workers are coming in and they're taking the jobs that would normally go to American workers. America's immigration system should bring in people who will expand opportunity for striving, low-income Americans, not to compete with those low-income Americans. (Applause.) Our proposal fulfills our sacred duty to those living here today, while ensuring America remains a welcoming country to immigrants joining us tomorrow. And we want immigrants coming in. We cherish the open door that we want to create for our country, but a big proportion of those immigrants must come in through merit and skill. (Applause.) The White House plan makes no change to the number of green cards allocated each year. But instead of admitting people through random chance, we will establish simple, universal criteria for admission to the United States. No matter where in the world you're born, no matter who your relatives are, if you want to become an American citizen, it will be clear exactly what standard we ask you to achieve. It will be made crystal clear. (Applause.) This will increase the diversity of immigration flows into our country. We will replace the existing green card categories with a new visa, the Build America visa , which is what we all want to hear. (Applause.) Like Canada and so many other modern countries, we create an easy-to-navigate points-based selection system. You will get more points for being a younger worker, meaning you will contribute more to our social safety net. You will get more points for having a valuable skill, an offer of employment, an advanced education, or a plan to create jobs. We lose people that want to start companies, and, in many cases, they're forced to leave our country; go back, usually, to the country where they came from; and they'll start up companies, and some of those companies are among the biggest and most successful companies today in the world. They could've started them right here in the United States, where they wanted to do it in the first place. Now they'll have a chance. (Applause.) Priority will also be given to higher-wage workers, ensuring we never undercut American labor. To protect benefits for American citizens, immigrants must be financially self-sufficient. Finally, to promote integration, assimilation, and national unity, future immigrants will be required to learn English and to pass a civics exam prior to admission. (Applause.) Through these steps, we will deliver an immigration system that respects, and even strengthens, our culture, our traditions, and our values. Four months ago, I had the honor of participating in a swearing-in ceremony for new Americans, right here in the Oval Office. It was a beautiful reminder that American citizenship is the most precious gift our nation has to offer. When we swear in new citizens, we do more than give them a permit; we give them a history, a heritage, a home, and a future of limitless possibilities and potential. Our nation used to pride ourselves on this capacity: our unique ability to instill the spirit of America into any human heart, into any human being. Many of the Democrats have claimed to be for these concepts at different times in their careers and, in many cases, in very recent history. And I hope that they will end up joining me and all of the people gathered together today in putting politics aside, putting security and wages first, and pursuing these historic reforms. It's time. (Applause.) And if for some reason , possibly political , we can't get the Democrats to approve this merit-based, high-security plan, then we will get it approved immediately after the election, when we take back the House, keep the Senate, and, of course, hold the presidency. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. But wouldn't it be nice to do it sooner than that? (Laughter.) But it's not a very long time, is it? Sixteen months. One of the reasons we will win is because of our strong, fair, and pro-America immigration policy. It's time to restore our national unity and reaffirm our national purpose. It is time to rebuild our country for all Americans. Together, we will create an immigration system to make America safer, and stronger, and greater than ever before. Thank you. God bless you all. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you."}
{"SpeechID":"VSDT2252019499","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2019-05-22","SpeechTitle":"Statement by President Trump","Type":"speech","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Good morning. So I came here to do a meeting on infrastructure with Democrats, not really thinking they wanted to do infrastructure or anything else, other than investigate. And I just saw that Nancy Pelosi, just before our meeting, made a statement that \"We believe that the President of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.\" Well, it turns out I'm the most , and I think most of you would agree to this , I'm the most transparent President, probably in the history of this country. We have given , on a witch hunt, on a hoax , the whole thing with Russia was a hoax, as it relates to the Trump administration and myself. It was a total horrible thing that happened to our country. It hurt us in so many ways. Despite that, we're setting records with the economy, with jobs. We have the most , most people employed today that we've ever had in the history of our country. We have the best unemployment numbers that we've had in the history of our country , in some cases, 51 years, but generally in the history of our country. Companies are moving back in. Things are going well. And I said, \"Let's have the meeting on infrastructure. We'll get that done easily.\" That's one of the easy ones. And instead of walking in happily into a meeting, I walk in to look at people that had just said that I was doing a cover-up. I don't do cover-ups. You people know that probably better than anybody. And I was just looking at a list of some of the things that we just did: more than 2,500 subpoenas qualified for. And I let everybody talk. I let the White House Counsel speak for 30 hours. Thirty hours. I have 19 Special Counsel lawyers; 40 FBI agents. I said, \"Open it all up. Let them have whatever they want.\" Nearly 500 search warrants. Think of that: a search warrant. Did you ever see a search warrant before? Neither did I. This was over 500 search warrants. And of the 19 people that were heading up this investigation, or whatever you want to call it, with Bob Mueller, they were contributors to the Democrat Party, most of them, and to Hillary Clinton. They hated President Trump. They hated him with a passion. They went to her big party after the election that turned out to be a wake, not a party. It was a wake. And they were very angry. These are the people that, after two years and 40 million or 35 million dollars , it'll end up being a lot more than that by the time all the bills are paid , this is what happened. No collusion. No obstruction. No nothing. They issued 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers. Think of that, though. Five hundred witnesses. And then I have Nancy Pelosi go out and say that the President of the United States engaged in a cover-up. Now, we've had a House investigation. We have Senate investigations. We have investigations like nobody has ever had before. And there's nothing , we did nothing wrong. They would have loved to have said we colluded. They would have loved it. These people were out to get us, the Republican Party and President Trump. They were out to get us. This was a one-sided, horrible thing. The bottom line is they said there's no collusion. No collusion with Russia. You heard so much talk about phone calls that my son made to me from this meeting that was set up by GPS Fusion, it looks like , which is the other side, for those that don't know. And for a year, I heard about phone calls went to a special number unauthorized. And it would have been my son, Don , who's a good young man, who's gone through hell. And they were calls that must have been made by him before and after the meeting , three calls. After massive study and work, they actually found who made the calls. One was a friend of ours , a real estate developer. Great guy. Most of you know him. Nice guy. He loves our country. And the other one was the head of NASCAR. Two of them. So, of the three calls that were so horrible that he had a meeting and he called me and then he had the meeting after and he made two more calls , and they were written about like this little , little lines, couple of lines. Nobody wanted to admit it. Even last night, we had a great election. I went there on Monday. We had a , an election for Fred Keller. It was a 50\/50 shot, and he won in a landslide. We went and we did a rally. Hardly mentioned today. And yet, if he lost, it would have been the biggest story in the country , even bigger than this witch hunt stuff that you guys keep writing about. So here's the bottom line: There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. We've been doing this since I've been President. And, actually, the crime was committed on the other side. We'll see how that all turns out. I hope it turns out well. But to my way of thinking , and I know a lot of you agree with me , the crime was committed on the other side. This whole thing was a take-down attempt at the President of the United States. And, honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves for the way you report it so it dishonestly , not all of you, but many of you. The way you report it. So I've said from the beginning, right from the beginning, that you probably can't go down two tracks. You can go down the investigation track, and you can go down the investment track or the track of \"Let's get things done for the American people.\" I love the American people. Drug prices are coming down , first time in 51 years , because of my administration. But we can get them down way lower working with the Democrats. We can solve the problem on the border in 15 minutes if the Democrats would give us a few votes. So I just wanted to let you know that I walked into the room and I told Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi, \"I want to do infrastructure. I want to do it more than you want to do it. I'd be really good at that. That's what I do. But you know what? You can't do it under these circumstances. So get these phony investigations over with.\" The Wall Street Journal just wrote today , just a little while ago, I saw it: \"Mr. Mueller wasn't obstructed in any way.\" This is a Wall Street Journal editorial today. \"Mr. Mueller wasn't obstructed in any way. His copious report \" , copious , 434 pages. Now they want to interview all of the same people again. They want to interview Jerry Nadler, who's been an enemy of mine for many years. He fought me in New York , unsuccessfully, by the way. I've had great success against Jerry. But he was representing Manhattan, and he would fight me all the time on the West Side railroad , many times, very unsuccessfully. He failed. I come to Washington. I've become President. And I said, \"Oh, no, I have Jerry Nadler again?\" So Wall Street Journal: \"Mr. Mueller wasn't obstructed in any way. His copious report was released for all to see, and there was no collusion \" , this is the Wall Street Journal , \" and there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\" That's it. But they want to make this a big deal. Whether or not they carry the big \"I\" word out , I can't imagine that, but they probably would because they'd do whatever they have to do. I'll tell you, there's a danger here. If someday a Democrat becomes President, and you have a Republican House, they could impeach him for any reason , or her. Any reason. We can't allow that to happen. We can't allow it to happen. So when you look at all of the transparency, when you look at all I've done , and I will tell you, my lawyers say, \"You don't have to do this. You can use presidential privilege. You don't have to let your lawyers and all of your staff testify. You can use presidential privilege, sir.\" \"Would you recommend it?\" \"Well, you can be transparent or you can be tight. Being , if you've done nothing wrong, being transparent is better.\" So I said, \"I did nothing wrong. Let's be transparent.\" So that's what you have. All of these things , look at that , all of these things. Five hundred witnesses that I allowed to testify. It's a disgrace. So when they get everything done, I'm all set to , let's get infrastructure. Let's get drug prices down. In the meantime, we're doing tremendous work without them. We're doing tremendous executive orders. A lot of work. We've had a great success. Most successful economy, perhaps, in our country's history. We've cut regulations at a level that nobody else has cut them before. The largest tax cut in the history of the country. So we're doing a lot of work. Steve? Yeah. Q Did Nancy Pelosi give you any assurances that they won't , the House won't look for (inaudible)? THE PRESIDENT: Look, this was very sad because this meeting was set up a number of days ago at 11 o'clock. All of a sudden, I hear last night, they're going to have a meeting, right before this meeting, to talk about the \"I\" word. The \"I\" word. Can you imagine? I don't speak to Russians about campaigns. When I went to Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania, I don't say, \"Oh, let's call Russia. Maybe they can \" It's a hoax. The greatest hoax in history. Yeah. Go ahead. Q Thank you, Mr. President. Do you view Congress as a co-equal branch of government? And do you respect their power of oversight? THE PRESIDENT: I respect the courts. I respect Congress. I respect right here where we're standing. But what they've done is abuse. This is investigation number four on the same thing , probably five. And it really started, I think, pretty much from the time we came down the escalator in Trump Tower. So I say to you that we're going to get everything done. We're doing a lot without them. Let them play their games. We're going to go down one track at a time. Let them finish up. And we'll be all set. Thank you, everybody.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1344800\/statement-by-president-trump&speechType=1","Summary":"Government Operations Criminal Justice","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/statement-president-trump-2\/","CleanText":"Thank you very much.

And I want to start by saying Happy Memorial Day. Happy Memorial Day. It's a great day. Thank you very much. And, you know, we had a tremendous couple of days with the Prime Minister. He's a great gentleman, great leader. And I just want to say that our First Lady and I are very honored to be here today on the JS Kaga. That's a great ship. They love this ship. You all love the ship, right? You feel good about it, don't you? I do too. I feel very safe on this. And I'm honored to be with my friend, the Prime Minister, and Mrs. Abe, and the extraordinary men and women of the United States Navy's Seventh Fleet and the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Forces. It was a great honor last night and this morning to meet and greet your new Emperor and Empress , two very, very special people. Spectacular. And we got to know them, and they're going to do a tremendous job for Japan. Going to make you very proud. On behalf of the First Lady and myself, I want to take a moment to send our prayers and sympathy to the victims of the stabbing attack this morning in Tokyo. All Americans stand with the people of Japan and grieve for the victims and for their families. Our thanks to Ambassador Hagerty, Mrs. Hagerty, Vice Admiral Phil Sawyer, and Rear Admiral Gregory Fenton for joining us today. Thank you very much. Thank you. My thanks as well to Admiral Hiroshi Yamamura and also to Captain Hideki Mizuta, who commands this magnificent ship, for joining us today. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. At this very historic moment, as Japan begins Reiwa and the Reiwa era, we celebrate the U.S.-Japan alliance and the friendship between our freedom-loving peoples. Our armed forces train and serve together around the world, including right here. Very special. In fact, this is the only port in the world where an American naval fleet and an allied naval fleet are headquartered side-by-side. The American and Japanese sailors stationed in this bay are living testaments to the enduring power of our incredible partnership. As you know, Japan recently announced its intent to purchase 105 brand new, stealth F-35 fighter aircraft. The best in the world. This purchase would give Japan the largest fleet of F-35s of any of our allies. And soon, this very ship will be upgraded to carry that cutting-edge aircraft. With this extraordinary new equipment, the JS Kaga will help our nations defend against a range of complex threats in the region and far beyond. I want to thank my friend and your Prime Minister , he's an extraordinary man , for his commitment to improving Japan's defense capabilities, which also advances the security of the United States of America. And to all of the incredible American and Japanese service members here today, it has been a true privilege to visit with you. On behalf of all Americans, we extend our deep gratitude for everything you do to safeguard our people. Again, thank you. God bless you all. Thank you very much. Thank you.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1344817\/remarks-by-president-trump-aboard-the-js-kaga&speechType=1","Summary":"Foreign Affairs","Source":null,"Location":"Yokosuka, Japan","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-aboard-js-kaga\/","CleanText":"Well, thank you very much. And I want to start by saying Happy Memorial Day. Happy Memorial Day. It's a great day. Thank you very much. And, you know, we had a tremendous couple of days with the Prime Minister. He's a great gentleman, great leader. And I just want to say that our First Lady and I are very honored to be here today on the JS Kaga. That's a great ship. They love this ship. You all love the ship, right? You feel good about it, don't you? I do too. I feel very safe on this. And I'm honored to be with my friend, the Prime Minister, and Mrs. Abe, and the extraordinary men and women of the United States Navy's Seventh Fleet and the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Forces. It was a great honor last night and this morning to meet and greet your new Emperor and Empress , two very, very special people. Spectacular. And we got to know them, and they're going to do a tremendous job for Japan. Going to make you very proud. On behalf of the First Lady and myself, I want to take a moment to send our prayers and sympathy to the victims of the stabbing attack this morning in Tokyo. All Americans stand with the people of Japan and grieve for the victims and for their families. Our thanks to Ambassador Hagerty, Mrs. Hagerty, Vice Admiral Phil Sawyer, and Rear Admiral Gregory Fenton for joining us today. Thank you very much. Thank you. My thanks as well to Admiral Hiroshi Yamamura and also to Captain Hideki Mizuta, who commands this magnificent ship, for joining us today. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. At this very historic moment, as Japan begins Reiwa and the Reiwa era, we celebrate the U.S.-Japan alliance and the friendship between our freedom-loving peoples. Our armed forces train and serve together around the world, including right here. Very special. In fact, this is the only port in the world where an American naval fleet and an allied naval fleet are headquartered side-by-side. The American and Japanese sailors stationed in this bay are living testaments to the enduring power of our incredible partnership. As you know, Japan recently announced its intent to purchase 105 brand new, stealth F-35 fighter aircraft. The best in the world. This purchase would give Japan the largest fleet of F-35s of any of our allies. And soon, this very ship will be upgraded to carry that cutting-edge aircraft. With this extraordinary new equipment, the JS Kaga will help our nations defend against a range of complex threats in the region and far beyond. I want to thank my friend and your Prime Minister , he's an extraordinary man , for his commitment to improving Japan's defense capabilities, which also advances the security of the United States of America. And to all of the incredible American and Japanese service members here today, it has been a true privilege to visit with you. On behalf of all Americans, we extend our deep gratitude for everything you do to safeguard our people. Again, thank you. God bless you all. Thank you very much. Thank you."}

This sustained influx of illegal aliens has profound consequences on every aspect of our national life, overwhelming our schools, overcrowding our hospitals, draining our welfare system, and causing untold amounts of crime. Gang members, smugglers, human traffickers, and illegal drugs and narcotics of all kinds are pouring across the Southern Border and directly into our communities. Thousands of innocent lives are taken every year as a result of this lawless chaos. It must end NOW! Mexico's passive cooperation in allowing this mass incursion constitutes an emergency and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States. Mexico has very strong immigration laws and could easily halt the illegal flow of migrants, including by returning them to their home countries. Additionally, Mexico could quickly and easily stop illegal aliens from coming through its southern border with Guatemala. For decades, the United States has suffered the severe and dangerous consequences of illegal immigration. Sadly, Mexico has allowed this situation to go on for many years, growing only worse with the passage of time. From a safety, national security, military, economic, and humanitarian standpoint, we cannot allow this grave disaster to continue. The current state of affairs is profoundly unfair to the American taxpayer, who bears the extraordinary financial cost imposed by large-scale illegal migration. Even worse is the terrible and preventable loss of human life. Some of the most deadly and vicious gangs on the planet operate just across our border and terrorize innocent communities. Mexico must step up and help solve this problem. We welcome people who come to the United States legally, but we cannot allow our laws to be broken and our borders to be violated. For years, Mexico has not treated us fairly, but we are now asserting our rights as a sovereign Nation. To address the emergency at the Southern Border, I am invoking the authorities granted to me by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Accordingly, starting on June 10, 2019, the United States will impose a 5 percent Tariff on all goods imported from Mexico. If the illegal migration crisis is alleviated through effective actions taken by Mexico, to be determined in our sole discretion and judgment, the Tariffs will be removed. If the crisis persists, however, the Tariffs will be raised to 10 percent on July 1, 2019. Similarly, if Mexico still has not taken action to dramatically reduce or eliminate the number of illegal aliens crossing its territory into the United States, Tariffs will be increased to 15 percent on August 1, 2019, to 20 percent on September 1, 2019, and to 25 percent on October 1, 2019. Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory. Workers who come to our country through the legal admissions process, including those working on farms, ranches, and in other businesses, will be allowed easy passage. If Mexico fails to act, Tariffs will remain at the high level, and companies located in Mexico may start moving back to the United States to make their products and goods. Companies that relocate to the United States will not pay the Tariffs or be affected in any way. Over the years, Mexico has made massive amounts of money in its dealings with the United States, and this includes the tremendous number of jobs leaving our country. Should Mexico choose not to cooperate on reducing unlawful migration, the sustained imposition of Tariffs will produce a massive return of jobs back to American cities and towns. Remember, our great country has been the \"piggy bank\" from which everybody wants only to TAKE. The difference is that now we are firmly and forcefully standing up for America's interests. We have confidence that Mexico can and will act swiftly to help the United States stop this long-term, dangerous, and deeply unfair problem. The United States has been very good to Mexico for many years. We are now asking that Mexico immediately do its fair share to stop the use of its territory as a conduit for illegal immigration into our country. The cartels and coyotes are having a greater and greater impact on the Mexican side of our Southern Border. This is a dire threat that must be decisively eliminated. Billions of dollars are made, and countless lives are ruined, by these ruthless and merciless criminal organizations. Mexico must bring law and order to its side of the border. Democrats in Congress are fully aware of this horrible situation and yet refuse to help in any way, shape, or form. This is a total dereliction of duty. The migrant crisis is a calamity that must now be solved, and can easily be solved, in Congress. Our broken asylum laws, court system, catch-and-release, visa lottery, chain migration, and many other loopholes can all be promptly corrected. When that happens, the measures being announced today can be more readily reduced or removed. The United States is a great country that can no longer be exploited due to its foolish and irresponsible immigration laws. For the sake of our people, and for the sake of our future, these horrendous laws must be changed now. At the same time, Mexico cannot allow hundreds of thousands of people to pour over its land and into our country, violating the sovereign territory of the United States. If Mexico does not take decisive measures, it will come at a significant price. We therefore look forward to, and appreciate, the swift and effective actions that we hope Mexico will immediately install. As President of the United States, my highest duty is the defense of the country and its citizens. A nation without borders is not a nation at all. I will not stand by and allow our sovereignty to be eroded, our laws to be trampled, or our borders to be disrespected anymore.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1346159\/statement-from-the-president-regarding-emergency-measures-to-address-the-border-crisis&speechType=6","Summary":"National Security Immigration","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/statement-president-regarding-emergency-measures-address-border-crisis\/","CleanText":"As everyone knows, the United States of America has been invaded by hundreds of thousands of people coming through Mexico and entering our country illegally.

Please. You just like all those brand new, beautiful airplanes that we're buying. (Laughter.) Hello, Air Force Academy. It's been a long time since I've been here. And what a place. What a place it is. At ease, everybody. (Laughter.) I'm thrilled to be here with all of you as we celebrate the incredible Class of 2019. AUDIENCE: Strong! THE PRESIDENT: And you truly make America proud. You make us all proud. Thank you very much. Great job. Really great job. (Applause.) And I want to thank Secretary Wilson for the introduction and for her two years of service as the first graduate of the academy to be the very important Secretary of the Air Force at a time when we've really expanded out the Air Force and bought equipment like you've never seen before. So, congratulations. Thank you very much, Heather. Beautiful job. (Applause.) And I want to thank three other truly remarkable former cadets: your Superintendent, Lieutenant General Jay Silvaria. (Applause.) Class of 1985. Jay, I thought you were a little bit younger than that. (Laughter.) General David Goldfein, Class of 1983. Thank you, General. (Applause.) Great job. Does a great job; respected by everybody. And NORTHCOM Commander, General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, Class of 1986. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, General. We're also grateful to be joined by Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, General John Hyten. General, thank you very much. (Applause.) Spent a lot of time together talking about things. (Laughter.) And Commander of Air Force Space Command, General Jay Raymond. Thank you, General. (Applause.) Space Command. And to all of the distinguished faculty, coaches, and staff, thank you for forging and refining a new generation of American warriors. We're also joined by many distinguished Air Force veterans and academy graduates. We applaud and salute you all. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. (Applause.) And to the thousands of moms and dads and grandparents and family members beaming with joy , and that's what they're doing; they are beaming with joy , thank you for raising rock-ribbed American patriots. (Applause.) America is stronger thanks to your love and your support for these incredible people , these incredible graduates. Cadets, join me in paying tribute to your amazing Air Force families. Go ahead, pay tribute. (Applause.) That's beautiful. That's beautiful. Without them, you wouldn't be here, and that's the way it is. (Laughter.) That's the way it is. (Laughter.) Most of all, to the nearly 1,000 cadets , who I have agreed to shake every single hand , (applause) , they gave me a choice. They said, \"Sir, you don't have to shake any hands.\" Some people do that. Those are the smart ones. They're out of here. (Laughter.) You can shake one hand to the one person, top of the class. You could shake 10, 50, or 100, and you could also stay for 1,000. And I'm staying for 1,000. Okay? (Applause.) And I know we're all going to make it. (Laughter.) There's no doubt about it, right? There's no doubt about it. To the nearly 1,000 cadets who will soon become Second Lieutenants in the U.S. Air Force: You could have chosen any school, any career you wanted, but you chose a harder path and a higher calling: to protect and defend the United States of America. I know what you've been through, and it's tougher. But you know what? In the end, it's better. You're going see. You'll see. (Laughter.) You'll see. Today, you take your place as officers in the most powerful Air Force in the history of our country and, frankly and very easily, in the history of the world. (Applause.) America commends the integrity, devotion, and commitment of the Class of 2019. (Applause.) When you choose the Air Force, you choose the noble road of service and duty and devotion. You choose to break old boundaries, and unlock new frontiers, and live life on the cutting edge. The first air combat happened just one century ago. You are the ones who will invent and define the next generation of air warfare. And you are the ones who will secure American victory all the time. Victory. To dominate the future, America must rule the skies. (Applause.) And that is what your time at this great academy has been all about: preparing you to do whatever it takes to learn, to adapt, and to win, win, win. You're going to win so much. You're going to get so tired of winning, but not really. (Laughter and applause.) Not really. We never get tired of winning, do we? AUDIENCE: No! THE PRESIDENT: No. Over the past four years, that's just what you've done. You've worked. You've preserved , persevered. You've excelled. You've done so many things that nobody else can do. And, in the end, you've come out on top. It took years of focus and discipline to get here, starting long before \"Beast.\" Right? Beast. You all know what \"Beast\" is, right? (Laughter.) Just being admitted to the Academy is a monumental achievement. Only 1 out of every 10 applicants makes the cut. And don't forget: Out of those 10 applicants, there are hundreds that think about it, but they know they don't even have a chance. So remember that. (Laughter and applause.) It's true, actually. It's actually , actually true. For those who are accepted, another 20 percent don't make it to graduation, sadly. Only the best survive to the very end. And here, under the majestic peaks of the Rockies, you have risen to every challenge, overcome every single obstacle, and proven yourselves worthy of the bars that will soon adorn your uniform. (Applause.) You survived BCT, made it to Recognition, and earned your Prop and Wings. (Applause.) You soared in gliders, piloted aircraft, and launched satellites that are now orbiting way, way above us, looking down on us. You performed advanced research, developed new technol , techniques. You honed your skills as cyber operators, and jumped out of planes thousands of feet above the Earth. Not easy. (Applause.) For America's airmen, the sky is never, ever the limit. That being said, even the best cadets can sometimes get a little bit carried away. Lieutenant General Silvaria has informed me that a few cadets are still on restriction for pranks and other fairly bad mischief. (Laughter.) You know what I'm talking about, right? And you all know who you are. (Laughter.) So, keeping with tradition, and as your Commander-in-Chief, I hereby absolve and pardon all cadets serving restrictions and confinements. (Applause.) And that, you earned. You earned it. So you're all on even footing. Is that nice? (Laughter.) This class has racked up a list of truly extraordinary achievements. Two graduating cadets recently received one of the most prestigious awards in all of academia: Rhodes scholarships. Please join me in congratulating cadets James Brahm and Madison Tung. Please stand up. (Applause.) Wow. Thank you very much. That's a big , a big, fat congratulations from me. That's a tremendous, tremendous job you've done. Thank you. Thank you, Madison. Great job. On the athletic fields, the Air Force has won 15 conference championships over the last four years, which is really something. A hundred and fifty-three athletes have earned All-American honors. Stand up. Stand up. (Applause.) All-American. Wow. (Applause.) Wow. It's fantastic. Congratulations. Including Rifle Team members Anna Weilbacher and Spencer Cap, who helped the Falcons win the air rifle national title and beat the other service academies to bring home the President's Trophy. Please, stand up. Stand up. (Applause.) It's fantastic. But you didn't enjoy beating those other academies. I don't think so, right? Not too much. And graduating cadet Nick Ready became the first person from any service academy to win the College Home Run Derby , wow, that's a big deal , with a record-breaking 55 home runs. Nick, where are you, Nick? Stand up. (Applause.) Come here, Nick. Come here. Get up here, Nick. Come here. (Applause.) Come here, Nick. You know, they gave him such a lousy seat all the way back in the corner. (Laughter.) Come on up. Baseball. Home Run Derby. That's something. In all of college baseball. Wow. I want to feel this guy's muscles. (Laughter.) It's real. That's real. That's great. Thank you very much, Nick. That's a big deal. That's a big deal. (Applause.) The members of this class come from every background, every state in the union, and even from our allies overseas. But through trial and training and tradition, you've become one family. It's what's happened. And like one family, you have all been pulling for one of your classmates, who has bravely fought his battle with cancer. Today, Parker Hammond graduates as a munitions and missiles maintenance officer , (applause) , along with the class that has stood with him every step of the way. (Applause.) Great , come on, Parker. Get up here, Parker. Parker. Come here. Come here, right? Come here. They love you, Parker. Why do you like him so much? (Applause.) Great job. Great. (Applause.) A lot of good-looking people in this school, I have to say. (Laughter.) Thank you, Parker. This class personifies the spirit of confidence and courage and unwavering commitment that has always defined the Long Blue Line. (Applause.) It's true. It goes all the way back to the very beginning, to the first cadet in the Air Force history. On in-processing day, you've , greeted at the base of a ramp by the statue of the legendary Val Bourque. Val grew up in a blue-collar family in Massachusetts. During his senior year in high school, he was recruited to play for the Pittsburgh Pirates. That's another baseball player. But instead, Val made the same choice as all of you: the choice of life of service. That's what he wanted. Val joined the U.S. Air Force Academy. He showed up at 4:30 a.m. on the Academy's opening day in 1955, so he would be the first Air Force cadet in history to take the Oath of Allegiance. He was thinking fast. The Academy proved an arduous challenge, however, for Val. It wasn't easy. As Val's roommate said, \"He was hanging on by a thread academically. No one was tested more than Val was. But he was at the very top in [his] character and [in] honor.\" That's what his roommate said. After Val finally made it to where you're sitting today, he volunteered to go to Vietnam and he proved to be one of the best pilots America had. He was amazing. He was incredible. After nearly a year of intense action, he was scheduled to return home. He was very excited but he asked to lead one more mission. On that day, Val's plane was struck by enemy fire, and he made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. He now rests on these precious grounds, and his fighting spirit lives in each and every one of you. Great fighting spirit. (Applause.) The heroes and legends of every generation have always had to confront new perils and defeat new dangers. No one can foresee all of the challenges this class will face, but we do know that, with absolute certainty, you are going to be ready to serve. You are going to be ready to lead. You are going to be aiming at the absolute highest point. And you are ready to \"Fly, Fight, and Win.\" Always win. (Applause.) Always. You exemplify the grit, the guts, and the grace that make America's Air Force, by far, the best in the world. And in the words of your class motto, \"Conquer Mind, Conquer All.\" Each of you has the sharp intellect, deep character, inner strength, and the titanium courage to vanquish any menace that dares to threaten our country or our people. (Applause.) We're always ready. Right, General? Always ready. He's ready. I wonder how that's going to be viewed , that statement , tomorrow in the press. (Laughter.) You can imagine. And that's okay. Let them think whatever they want to think. (Applause.) More than half of you will soon head to pilot training, where you will prepare to unleash American thunder anywhere we need. Another 45 will join our Remotely Piloted Aircraft program. A record number of you will become space operators. You will specialize in combat rescues, intelligence, missile maintenance, weather, air traffic control, engineering, and much, much more. Each of you is graduating at a truly incredible time for our country. Our country is doing well. Our country is respected again. (Applause.) We are respected again. And we're reawakening American pride, American confidence, and American greatness. You know that. These gentlemen know it; I'll tell you right now. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That's very nice. And we are restoring the fundamental principle that our first obligation and highest loyalty is to the American citizen. No longer will we sacrifice America's interests to any foreign power. We don't do that anymore. (Applause.) In all things and ways, we are putting America first, and it's about time. (Applause.) Our economy is booming, our people are thriving, and our military is stronger, mightier, and more powerful , with all of that new aircraft , than ever before. I am committed to keeping our military the best trained, best equipped, and most technologically advanced fighting force anywhere under the sun. (Applause.) Last year, against some pretty strong opposition, which I'll always have, we secured $700 billion to support our warfighters, followed by another $716 billion , not million , billion. That's with a \"B.\" (Laughter.) Seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars this year. That means we are delivering 56 new Air Force F-35s, brand new stealth. (Applause.) I asked somebody on the other side, \"What do you think of that plane?\" A foreign leader. They said, \"We have a problem with it; we can't see it.\" (Laughter.) It's always good. It's always good when they can't see you. Twenty-four new Reaper remotely piloted Aircraft, fifteen new Pegasus aerial refueling aircraft, ten new combat rescue helicopters, and a well-earned pay raise for every soldier, sailor, airman, Coast Guardsman, and Marine in the United States military. (Applause.) And if anybody wants to give up your raise, it's okay. We'll accept that. Okay? (Laughter.) Don't do it. (Laughter.) We're also asking Congress to invest more in hypersonic weapons. We have things under development, the likes of which you've never seen; the likes of which you can't even conceive. Artificial intelligence, nuclear weapons and modernization, and space superiority. And we're soon having, as you know, something that I started. And it started a little slow, and now everybody has embraced it: Space Force. And you're going to be working with them. (Applause.) And, General, I want to thank you for helping us so much. It's been really great. Working with you has been great. A whole new force. In this stadium today are many of the future leaders who will develop the doctrine, strategy, and technology to restore America's legacy of leadership in space. As you know, other nations are moving aggressively to weaponize space with new technologies that can disrupt vital communications and blind satellites that are critical to our battlefield operations. It is a time for America to reclaim the ultimate high ground and prepare our young warriors of today for victory on the battlefield tomorrow. It's a very different battlefield. It's a very different type of warfare. But we are so advanced. And when you see what's coming, you won't even believe it. And hopefully , you know what? Hopefully, we never have to use it. Peace through strength. Peace through strength. (Applause.) As your Commander-in-Chief, I want you to know that we will pursue and maintain the overwhelming strength we need to deter any aggressor and thrash any foe. For that reason, I am committed to building the Air Force we need with the full strength of 386 squadrons. And we're getting it done, too. It's happening rapidly. Because nothing will ever strike more fear in the hearts of our enemies or inspire more confidence in our friends than the roaring engines of American fighter jets, flown by the greatest pilots on the planet Earth, by far: you. (Applause.) The sound of American warplanes is the righteous sound of American justice. Today, you inherit a legacy of service and valor handed down through generations. It's a tradition built by legends like Rickenbacker, Doolittle, Wagner, Archer, Boyd, Yeager, Sijan, Grissom, and Chapman. Great people. Great people. (Applause.) These trailblazers broke barriers after barrier, and they innovated and adapted to push America further, faster, and on to total victory. It is the same spirit embodied by your Class Exemplar, Neil Armstrong, who started out flying jets over Korea, and, 50 years ago this summer, planted our great American flag on the face of the moon. Just like all the aces of our past and the heroes of our history, they were ready to lead when America needed them most. And so is every cadet who graduates today. Is that correct? (Applause.) I think so. You are the patriots whose names will go down in Air Force history. You will redefine warfare at a very, very critical time in our country's history. You'll win great battles and bring our enemies to crushing defeat. You will explore the boundaries of space, and keep America forever proud and forever free. So today, you take the controls. You're going to push it up and chart your course across the sky. Keep the wings level and true, because your country is sending you on a vital mission: to defend America, protect our people, and to pursue our nation's great and glorious destiny. Nothing will stop you from victory. Nothing will stop the U.S. Air Force. And with your help, nothing ever, ever will stop the United States of America. (Applause.) So I want to conclude by giving a very special congratulations to a very special group of amazing cadets and people. It's the Class of 2019. AUDIENCE: Strong! THE PRESIDENT: On behalf of our nation, God bless you, God bless the Air Force, and God bless America. This is a great honor being with you. Thank you. And congratulations to everybody. Thank you.

Please. You just like all those brand new, beautiful airplanes that we're buying. (Laughter.) Hello, Air Force Academy. It's been a long time since I've been here. And what a place. What a place it is. At ease, everybody. (Laughter.) I'm thrilled to be here with all of you as we celebrate the incredible Class of 2019. And you truly make America proud. You make us all proud. Thank you very much. Great job. Really great job. (Applause.) And I want to thank Secretary Wilson for the introduction and for her two years of service as the first graduate of the academy to be the very important Secretary of the Air Force at a time when we've really expanded out the Air Force and bought equipment like you've never seen before. So, congratulations. Thank you very much, Heather. Beautiful job. (Applause.) And I want to thank three other truly remarkable former cadets: your Superintendent, Lieutenant General Jay Silvaria. (Applause.) Class of 1985. Jay, I thought you were a little bit younger than that. (Laughter.) General David Goldfein, Class of 1983. Thank you, General. (Applause.) Great job. Does a great job; respected by everybody. And NORTHCOM Commander, General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, Class of 1986. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, General. We're also grateful to be joined by Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, General John Hyten. General, thank you very much. (Applause.) Spent a lot of time together talking about things. (Laughter.) And Commander of Air Force Space Command, General Jay Raymond. Thank you, General. (Applause.) Space Command. And to all of the distinguished faculty, coaches, and staff, thank you for forging and refining a new generation of American warriors. We're also joined by many distinguished Air Force veterans and academy graduates. We applaud and salute you all. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. (Applause.) And to the thousands of moms and dads and grandparents and family members beaming with joy , and that's what they're doing; they are beaming with joy , thank you for raising rock-ribbed American patriots. (Applause.) America is stronger thanks to your love and your support for these incredible people , these incredible graduates. Cadets, join me in paying tribute to your amazing Air Force families. Go ahead, pay tribute. (Applause.) That's beautiful. That's beautiful. Without them, you wouldn't be here, and that's the way it is. (Laughter.) That's the way it is. (Laughter.) Most of all, to the nearly 1,000 cadets , who I have agreed to shake every single hand , (applause) , they gave me a choice. They said, 'Sir, you don't have to shake any hands.' Some people do that. Those are the smart ones. They're out of here. (Laughter.) You can shake one hand to the one person, top of the class. You could shake 10, 50, or 100, and you could also stay for 1,000. And I'm staying for 1,000. Okay? (Applause.) And I know we're all going to make it. (Laughter.) There's no doubt about it, right? There's no doubt about it. To the nearly 1,000 cadets who will soon become Second Lieutenants in the U.S. Air Force: You could have chosen any school, any career you wanted, but you chose a harder path and a higher calling: to protect and defend the United States of America. I know what you've been through, and it's tougher. But you know what? In the end, it's better. You're going see. You'll see. (Laughter.) You'll see. Today, you take your place as officers in the most powerful Air Force in the history of our country and, frankly and very easily, in the history of the world. (Applause.) America commends the integrity, devotion, and commitment of the Class of 2019. (Applause.) When you choose the Air Force, you choose the noble road of service and duty and devotion. You choose to break old boundaries, and unlock new frontiers, and live life on the cutting edge. The first air combat happened just one century ago. You are the ones who will invent and define the next generation of air warfare. And you are the ones who will secure American victory all the time. Victory. To dominate the future, America must rule the skies. (Applause.) And that is what your time at this great academy has been all about: preparing you to do whatever it takes to learn, to adapt, and to win, win, win. You're going to win so much. You're going to get so tired of winning, but not really. (Laughter and applause.) Not really. We never get tired of winning, do we? No. Over the past four years, that's just what you've done. You've worked. You've preserved , persevered. You've excelled. You've done so many things that nobody else can do. And, in the end, you've come out on top. It took years of focus and discipline to get here, starting long before 'Beast.' Right? Beast. You all know what 'Beast' is, right? (Laughter.) Just being admitted to the Academy is a monumental achievement. Only 1 out of every 10 applicants makes the cut. And don't forget: Out of those 10 applicants, there are hundreds that think about it, but they know they don't even have a chance. So remember that. (Laughter and applause.) It's true, actually. It's actually , actually true. For those who are accepted, another 20 percent don't make it to graduation, sadly. Only the best survive to the very end. And here, under the majestic peaks of the Rockies, you have risen to every challenge, overcome every single obstacle, and proven yourselves worthy of the bars that will soon adorn your uniform. (Applause.) You survived BCT, made it to Recognition, and earned your Prop and Wings. (Applause.) You soared in gliders, piloted aircraft, and launched satellites that are now orbiting way, way above us, looking down on us. You performed advanced research, developed new technol , techniques. You honed your skills as cyber operators, and jumped out of planes thousands of feet above the Earth. Not easy. (Applause.) For America's airmen, the sky is never, ever the limit. That being said, even the best cadets can sometimes get a little bit carried away. Lieutenant General Silvaria has informed me that a few cadets are still on restriction for pranks and other fairly bad mischief. (Laughter.) You know what I'm talking about, right? And you all know who you are. (Laughter.) So, keeping with tradition, and as your Commander-in-Chief, I hereby absolve and pardon all cadets serving restrictions and confinements. (Applause.) And that, you earned. You earned it. So you're all on even footing. Is that nice? (Laughter.) This class has racked up a list of truly extraordinary achievements. Two graduating cadets recently received one of the most prestigious awards in all of academia: Rhodes scholarships. Please join me in congratulating cadets James Brahm and Madison Tung. Please stand up. (Applause.) Wow. Thank you very much. That's a big , a big, fat congratulations from me. That's a tremendous, tremendous job you've done. Thank you. Thank you, Madison. Great job. On the athletic fields, the Air Force has won 15 conference championships over the last four years, which is really something. A hundred and fifty-three athletes have earned All-American honors. Stand up. Stand up. (Applause.) All-American. Wow. (Applause.) Wow. It's fantastic. Congratulations. Including Rifle Team members Anna Weilbacher and Spencer Cap, who helped the Falcons win the air rifle national title and beat the other service academies to bring home the President's Trophy. Please, stand up. Stand up. (Applause.) It's fantastic. But you didn't enjoy beating those other academies. I don't think so, right? Not too much. And graduating cadet Nick Ready became the first person from any service academy to win the College Home Run Derby , wow, that's a big deal , with a record-breaking 55 home runs. Nick, where are you, Nick? Stand up. (Applause.) Come here, Nick. Come here. Get up here, Nick. Come here. (Applause.) Come here, Nick. You know, they gave him such a lousy seat all the way back in the corner. (Laughter.) Come on up. Baseball. Home Run Derby. That's something. In all of college baseball. Wow. I want to feel this guy's muscles. (Laughter.) It's real. That's real. That's great. Thank you very much, Nick. That's a big deal. That's a big deal. (Applause.) The members of this class come from every background, every state in the union, and even from our allies overseas. But through trial and training and tradition, you've become one family. It's what's happened. And like one family, you have all been pulling for one of your classmates, who has bravely fought his battle with cancer. Today, Parker Hammond graduates as a munitions and missiles maintenance officer , (applause) , along with the class that has stood with him every step of the way. (Applause.) Great , come on, Parker. Get up here, Parker. Parker. Come here. Come here, right? Come here. They love you, Parker. Why do you like him so much? (Applause.) Great job. Great. (Applause.) A lot of good-looking people in this school, I have to say. (Laughter.) Thank you, Parker. This class personifies the spirit of confidence and courage and unwavering commitment that has always defined the Long Blue Line. (Applause.) It's true. It goes all the way back to the very beginning, to the first cadet in the Air Force history. On in-processing day, you've , greeted at the base of a ramp by the statue of the legendary Val Bourque. Val grew up in a blue-collar family in Massachusetts. During his senior year in high school, he was recruited to play for the Pittsburgh Pirates. That's another baseball player. But instead, Val made the same choice as all of you: the choice of life of service. That's what he wanted. Val joined the U.S. Air Force Academy. He showed up at 4:30 a.m. on the Academy's opening day in 1955, so he would be the first Air Force cadet in history to take the Oath of Allegiance. He was thinking fast. The Academy proved an arduous challenge, however, for Val. It wasn't easy. As Val's roommate said, 'He was hanging on by a thread academically. No one was tested more than Val was. But he was at the very top in character and honor.' That's what his roommate said. After Val finally made it to where you're sitting today, he volunteered to go to Vietnam and he proved to be one of the best pilots America had. He was amazing. He was incredible. After nearly a year of intense action, he was scheduled to return home. He was very excited but he asked to lead one more mission. On that day, Val's plane was struck by enemy fire, and he made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. He now rests on these precious grounds, and his fighting spirit lives in each and every one of you. Great fighting spirit. (Applause.) The heroes and legends of every generation have always had to confront new perils and defeat new dangers. No one can foresee all of the challenges this class will face, but we do know that, with absolute certainty, you are going to be ready to serve. You are going to be ready to lead. You are going to be aiming at the absolute highest point. And you are ready to 'Fly, Fight, and Win.' Always win. (Applause.) Always. You exemplify the grit, the guts, and the grace that make America's Air Force, by far, the best in the world. And in the words of your class motto, 'Conquer Mind, Conquer All.' Each of you has the sharp intellect, deep character, inner strength, and the titanium courage to vanquish any menace that dares to threaten our country or our people. (Applause.) We're always ready. Right, General? Always ready. He's ready. I wonder how that's going to be viewed , that statement , tomorrow in the press. (Laughter.) You can imagine. And that's okay. Let them think whatever they want to think. (Applause.) More than half of you will soon head to pilot training, where you will prepare to unleash American thunder anywhere we need. Another 45 will join our Remotely Piloted Aircraft program. A record number of you will become space operators. You will specialize in combat rescues, intelligence, missile maintenance, weather, air traffic control, engineering, and much, much more. Each of you is graduating at a truly incredible time for our country. Our country is doing well. Our country is respected again. (Applause.) We are respected again. And we're reawakening American pride, American confidence, and American greatness. You know that. These gentlemen know it; I'll tell you right now. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That's very nice. And we are restoring the fundamental principle that our first obligation and highest loyalty is to the American citizen. No longer will we sacrifice America's interests to any foreign power. We don't do that anymore. (Applause.) In all things and ways, we are putting America first, and it's about time. (Applause.) Our economy is booming, our people are thriving, and our military is stronger, mightier, and more powerful , with all of that new aircraft , than ever before. I am committed to keeping our military the best trained, best equipped, and most technologically advanced fighting force anywhere under the sun. (Applause.) Last year, against some pretty strong opposition, which I'll always have, we secured $700 billion to support our warfighters, followed by another $716 billion , not million , billion. That's with a 'B.' (Laughter.) Seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars this year. That means we are delivering 56 new Air Force F-35s, brand new stealth. (Applause.) I asked somebody on the other side, 'What do you think of that plane?' A foreign leader. They said, 'We have a problem with it; we can't see it.' (Laughter.) It's always good. It's always good when they can't see you. Twenty-four new Reaper remotely piloted Aircraft, fifteen new Pegasus aerial refueling aircraft, ten new combat rescue helicopters, and a well-earned pay raise for every soldier, sailor, airman, Coast Guardsman, and Marine in the United States military. (Applause.) And if anybody wants to give up your raise, it's okay. We'll accept that. Okay? (Laughter.) Don't do it. (Laughter.) We're also asking Congress to invest more in hypersonic weapons. We have things under development, the likes of which you've never seen; the likes of which you can't even conceive. Artificial intelligence, nuclear weapons and modernization, and space superiority. And we're soon having, as you know, something that I started. And it started a little slow, and now everybody has embraced it: Space Force. And you're going to be working with them. (Applause.) And, General, I want to thank you for helping us so much. It's been really great. Working with you has been great. A whole new force. In this stadium today are many of the future leaders who will develop the doctrine, strategy, and technology to restore America's legacy of leadership in space. As you know, other nations are moving aggressively to weaponize space with new technologies that can disrupt vital communications and blind satellites that are critical to our battlefield operations. It is a time for America to reclaim the ultimate high ground and prepare our young warriors of today for victory on the battlefield tomorrow. It's a very different battlefield. It's a very different type of warfare. But we are so advanced. And when you see what's coming, you won't even believe it. And hopefully , you know what? Hopefully, we never have to use it. Peace through strength. Peace through strength. (Applause.) As your Commander-in-Chief, I want you to know that we will pursue and maintain the overwhelming strength we need to deter any aggressor and thrash any foe. For that reason, I am committed to building the Air Force we need with the full strength of 386 squadrons. And we're getting it done, too. It's happening rapidly. Because nothing will ever strike more fear in the hearts of our enemies or inspire more confidence in our friends than the roaring engines of American fighter jets, flown by the greatest pilots on the planet Earth, by far: you. (Applause.) The sound of American warplanes is the righteous sound of American justice. Today, you inherit a legacy of service and valor handed down through generations. It's a tradition built by legends like Rickenbacker, Doolittle, Wagner, Archer, Boyd, Yeager, Sijan, Grissom, and Chapman. Great people. Great people. (Applause.) These trailblazers broke barriers after barrier, and they innovated and adapted to push America further, faster, and on to total victory. It is the same spirit embodied by your Class Exemplar, Neil Armstrong, who started out flying jets over Korea, and, 50 years ago this summer, planted our great American flag on the face of the moon. Just like all the aces of our past and the heroes of our history, they were ready to lead when America needed them most. And so is every cadet who graduates today. Is that correct? (Applause.) I think so. You are the patriots whose names will go down in Air Force history. You will redefine warfare at a very, very critical time in our country's history. You'll win great battles and bring our enemies to crushing defeat. You will explore the boundaries of space, and keep America forever proud and forever free. So today, you take the controls. You're going to push it up and chart your course across the sky. Keep the wings level and true, because your country is sending you on a vital mission: to defend America, protect our people, and to pursue our nation's great and glorious destiny. Nothing will stop you from victory. Nothing will stop the U.S. Air Force. And with your help, nothing ever, ever will stop the United States of America. (Applause.) So I want to conclude by giving a very special congratulations to a very special group of amazing cadets and people. It's the Class of 2019. On behalf of our nation, God bless you, God bless the Air Force, and God bless America. This is a great honor being with you. Thank you. And congratulations to everybody. Thank you. (Applause.)"}

Thank you very much. (Applause.) So tonight we come together to celebrate American life, history, culture, and the eternal legacy of President Abraham Lincoln. I want to thank all of the chairs of the gala, including your honorary co-chair, America's beloved First Lady. Oh, I'd love to have her poll numbers. (Applause.) How do I get her poll numbers, Kevin, John? (Applause.) And they do love you. We're honored to be joined by many members of my Cabinet , thank you very much; and members of Congress. Many friends and distinguished guests , very distinguished, as a matter of fact. A special thanks to our host and my good friend for a long time, Larry Gatlin, and his brothers, as well as the chair of Ford's Theatre Board of Trustees, Phebe. Thank you very much. What a job. What a job. Thank you. (Applause.) And finally to Paul Tetreault , and the way you ran those stairs, Paul. I was going to do it but I didn't want to take a chance. (Laughter.) And the entire staff of Ford's Theatre, thank you very much for everything you've done. This is an event that we hope to be here , what do you figure? , another six times, right? (Laughter.) Six times, at least. At least. (Applause.) Because we do want to preserve this heritage and this center's treasured legacy. I also want to congratulate tonight's Lincoln Medal Recipients: a man I have a lot of respect for, General Colin Powell, and his wife Alma. And maybe even more respect for you, Alma. (Applause.) Great job. Great job. Thank you and thank you for your service to our nation. You have been outstanding. Two people to really look up to. Congratulations. Congratulations. (Applause.) And congratulations as well to somebody I used to watch a lot, Mark Russell, who has been a devoted performer at Ford's Theatre for many, many years. Mark, congratulations. Congratulations to him. (Applause.) For decades, families from all around the world and all around the country have come to this very treasured place to gain a glimpse into President Lincoln's life, and, in so doing, into one of the most vital chapters and probably one of the most interesting chapters in American history. During our nation's greatest trial, President Lincoln stood for truth and freedom and human equality. As President Lincoln's friend, the renowned abolitionist Fredrick Douglass, said: \"Abraham Lincoln was called upon to decide the fate of the Republic.\" So true. \"He did not hesitate, he did not doubt, he did not falter his faith was strong\" and his unwavering in patriotism, like nobody else. And he had great patriotism for this country and for countrymen. That's a , was quite a legacy, and quite a statement from another great man. The patriotism of President Lincoln has lived on in every subsequent generation that has risen to the call of destiny andthe demands of duty. This week, we are commemorating another moment when our nation and the entire world was tested at the highest level: the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Right after this event, Melania and I will board Air Force One and travel to the United Kingdom, and then to Normandy, France. On that precious soil, we will honor the more than 150,000 Allied troops who landed on D-Day, and the millions more who fought in the Second World War. As one people, America came together to pledge our resolve to protect the sacred rights and freedoms that these immortal patriots gave their very lives to secure. We will never forget America's heroes , never, ever, ever. Our duty, and the duty of every patriot, is to pass on the inheritance of liberty and justice that is the cherished birthright of all Americans. Thank you again to Ford's Theatre and everyone here tonight. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

It looks like the weather is beautiful, but who knows; it changes fast. I think it's going to be an incredible, special day in a very special and very important place. So I look forward to that. As you know, Mexico was in yesterday. They're coming back this morning, in Washington. They'll be meeting at the White House. I think a lot of progress was made yesterday, but we have to make a lot of progress. Mexico has been making, for many, many years, hundreds of mill- , of billions of dollars. They've been making an absolute fortune on the United States. They have to step up, and they have to step up to the plate, and perhaps they will. We're going to see. They can solve the problem. The Democrats , Congress has been a disaster. They won't change. They won't do anything. They want free immigration , immigration to pour into our country. They don't care who it is. They don't care what kind of a record they have. It doesn't make any difference. They're not going to be changing anything. We go to them, we say, \"Let's fix the immigration laws.\" They just want it to do badly. The worse it does, the happier they are. So that's the way it is, and, I guess, that's the way it'll be until after the election. It's a disgrace. Because, frankly, we could solve this problem so easy if the Democrats in Congress were willing to make some changes, but they're not. And that's the way it is. They want to just ride it out. They want to have a real bad time. They don't care about crime. They don't care about drugs pouring into our country. They couldn't care less. It's all politics. It's a vicious business. So that's the way it is. But we're having a great talk with Mexico. We'll see what happens. But something pretty dramatic could happen. We've told Mexico the tariffs go on. And I mean it, too. And I'm very happy with it. And lot of people, senators included, they have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to tariffs. They have no , absolutely no idea. When you have the money, when you have the product, when you have the thing that everybody wants, you're in a position to do very well with tariffs, and that's where we are. We're the piggybank. The United States is the piggybank. It has all the money that others want to take from us, but they're not taking it so easy anymore. It's a lot different. Our talks with China , a lot of interesting things are happening. We'll see what happens. In the meantime, we're getting 25 percent on $250 billion, and I can go up another at least $300 billion. And I'll do that at the right time. But I think China wants to make a deal badly. I think Mexico wants to make a deal badly. And I'm going to Normandy. Thank you.

So that's the way it is. But we're having a great talk with Mexico. We'll see what happens. But something pretty dramatic could happen. We've told Mexico the tariffs go on. And I mean it, too. And I'm very happy with it. And lot of people, senators included, they have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to tariffs. They have no , absolutely no idea. When you have the money, when you have the product, when you have the thing that everybody wants, you're in a position to do very well with tariffs, and that's where we are. We're the piggybank. The United States is the piggybank. It has all the money that others want to take from us, but they're not taking it so easy anymore. It's a lot different. Our talks with China , a lot of interesting things are happening. We'll see what happens. In the meantime, we're getting 25 percent on $250 billion, and I can go up another at least $300 billion. And I'll do that at the right time. But I think China wants to make a deal badly. I think Mexico wants to make a deal badly. And I'm going to Normandy. Thank you. Thank you, everybody."}

On these shores, on these bluffs, on this day 75 years ago, 10,000 men shed their blood, and thousands sacrificed their lives, for their brothers, for their countries, and for the survival of liberty. Today, we remember those who fell, and we honor all who fought right here in Normandy. They won back this ground for civilization. To more than 170 veterans of the Second World War who join us today: You are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live. You're the pride of our nation. You are the glory of our republic. And we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. (Applause.) Here with you are over 60 veterans who landed on D-Day. Our debt to you is everlasting. Today, we express our undying gratitude. When you were young, these men enlisted their lives in a Great Crusade , one of the greatest of all times. Their mission is the story of an epic battle and the ferocious, eternal struggle between good and evil. On the 6th of June, 1944, they joined a liberation force of awesome power and breathtaking scale. After months of planning, the Allies had chosen this ancient coastline to mount their campaign to vanquish the wicked tyranny of the Nazi empire from the face of the Earth. The battle began in the skies above us. In those first tense midnight hours, 1,000 aircraft roared overhead with 17,000 Allied airborne troops preparing to leap into the darkness beyond these trees. Then came dawn. The enemy who had occupied these heights saw the largest naval armada in the history of the world. Just a few miles offshore were 7,000 vessels bearing 130,000 warriors. They were the citizens of free and independent nations, united by their duty to their compatriots and to millions yet unborn. There were the British, whose nobility and fortitude saw them through the worst of Dunkirk and the London Blitz. The full violence of Nazi fury was no match for the full grandeur of British pride. Thank you. (Applause.) There were the Canadians, whose robust sense of honor and loyalty compelled them to take up arms alongside Britain from the very, very beginning. There were the fighting Poles, the tough Norwegians, and the intrepid Aussies. There were the gallant French commandos, soon to be met by thousands of their brave countrymen ready to write a new chapter in the long history of French valor. (Applause.) And, finally, there were the Americans. They came from the farms of a vast heartland, the streets of glowing cities, and the forges of mighty industrial towns. Before the war, many had never ventured beyond their own community. Now they had come to offer their lives half a world from home. This beach, codenamed Omaha, was defended by the Nazis with monstrous firepower, thousands and thousands of mines and spikes driven into the sand, so deeply. It was here that tens of thousands of the Americans came. The GIs who boarded the landing craft that morning knew that they carried on their shoulders not just the pack of a soldier, but the fate of the world. Colonel George Taylor, whose 16th Infantry Regiment would join in the first wave, was asked: What would happen if the Germans stopped right then and there, cold on the beach , just stopped them? What would happen? This great American replied: \"Why, the 18th Infantry is coming in right behind us. The 26th Infantry will come on too. Then there is the 2nd Infantry Division already afloat. And the 9th Division. And the 2nd Armored. And the 3rd Armored. And all the rest. Maybe the 16th won't make it, but someone will.\" One of those men in Taylor's 16th Regiment was Army medic Ray Lambert. Ray was only 23, but he had already earned three Purple Hearts and two Silver Stars fighting in North Africa and Sicily, where he and his brother Bill, no longer with us, served side by side. In the early morning hours, the two brothers stood together on the deck of the USS Henrico, before boarding two separate Higgins landing craft. \"If I don't make it,\" Bill said, \"please, please take care of my family.\" Ray asked his brother to do the same. Of the 31 men on Ray's landing craft, only Ray and 6 others made it to the beach. There were only a few of them left. They came to the sector right here below us. \"Easy Red\" it was called. Again and again, Ray ran back into the water. He dragged out one man after another. He was shot through the arm. His leg was ripped open by shrapnel. His back was broken. He nearly drowned. He had been on the beach for hours, bleeding and saving lives, when he finally lost consciousness. He woke up the next day on a cot beside another badly wounded soldier. He looked over and saw his brother Bill. They made it. They made it. They made it. At 98 years old, Ray is here with us today, with his fourth Purple Heart and his third Silver Star from Omaha. (Applause.) Ray, the free world salutes you. (Applause.) Thank you, Ray. (Applause.) Nearly two hours in, unrelenting fire from these bluffs kept the Americans pinned down on the sand now red with our heroes' blood. Then, just a few hundred yards from where I'm standing, a breakthrough came. The battle turned, and with it, history. Down on the beach, Captain Joe Dawson, the son of a Texas preacher, led Company G through a minefield to a natural fold in the hillside, still here. Just beyond this path to my right, Captain Dawson snuck beneath an enemy machine gun perch and tossed his grenades. Soon, American troops were charging up \"Dawson's Draw.\" What a job he did. What bravery he showed. Lieutenant Spalding and the men from Company E moved on to crush the enemy strongpoint on the far side of this cemetery, and stop the slaughter on the beach below. Countless more Americans poured out across this ground all over the countryside. They joined fellow American warriors from Utah beach, and Allies from Juno, Sword, and Gold, along with the airborne and the French patriots. Private First Class Russell Pickett, of the 29th Division's famed 116th Infantry Regiment, had been wounded in the first wave that landed on Omaha Beach. At a hospital in England, Private Pickett vowed to return to battle. \"I'm going to return,\" he said. \"I'm going to return.\" Six days after D-Day, he rejoined his company. Two thirds had been killed already; many had been wounded, within 15 minutes of the invasion. They'd lost 19 just from small town of Bedford, Virginia, alone. Before long, a grenade left Private Pickett again gravely wounded. So badly wounded. Again, he chose to return. He didn't care; he had to be here. He was then wounded a third time, and laid unconscious for 12 days. They thought he was gone. They thought he had no chance. Russell Pickett is the last known survivor of the legendary Company A. And, today, believe it or not, he has returned once more to these shores to be with his comrades. Private Pickett, you honor us all with your presence. (Applause.) Tough guy. (Laughter.) By the fourth week of August, Paris was liberated. (Applause.) Some who landed here pushed all the way to the center of Germany. Some threw open the gates of Nazi concentration camps to liberate Jews who had suffered the bottomless horrors of the Holocaust. And some warriors fell on other fields of battle, returning to rest on this soil for eternity. Before this place was consecrated to history, the land was owned by a French farmer, a member of the French resistance. These were great people. These were strong and tough people. His terrified wife waited out D-Day in a nearby house, holding tight to their little baby girl. The next day, a soldier appeared. \"I'm an American,\" he said. \"I'm here to help.\" The French woman was overcome with emotion and cried. Days later, she laid flowers on fresh American graves. Today, her granddaughter, Stefanie, serves as a guide at this cemetery. This week, Stefanie led 92-year-old Marian Wynn of California to see the grave of her brother Don for the very first time. Marian and Stefanie are both with us today. And we thank you for keeping alive the memories of our precious heroes. Thank you. (Applause.) 9,388 young Americans rest beneath the white crosses and Stars of David arrayed on these beautiful grounds. Each one has been adopted by a French family that thinks of him as their own. They come from all over France to look after our boys. They kneel. They cry. They pray. They place flowers. And they never forget. Today, America embraces the French people and thanks you for honoring our beloved dead. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. To all of our friends and partners: Our cherished alliance was forged in the heat of battle, tested in the trials of war, and proven in the blessings of peace. Our bond is unbreakable. From across the Earth, Americans are drawn to this place as though it were a part of our very soul. We come not only because of what they did here. We come because of who they were. They were young men with their entire lives before them. They were husbands who said goodbye to their young brides and took their duty as their fate. They were fathers who would never meet their infant sons and daughters because they had a job to do. And with God as their witness, they were going to get it done. They came wave after wave, without question, without hesitation, and without complaint. More powerful than the strength of American arms was the strength of American hearts. These men ran through the fires of hell moved by a force no weapon could destroy: the fierce patriotism of a free, proud, and sovereign people. (Applause.) They battled not for control and domination, but for liberty, democracy, and self-rule. They pressed on for love in home and country , the Main Streets, the schoolyards, the churches and neighbors, the families and communities that gave us men such as these. They were sustained by the confidence that America can do anything because we are a noble nation, with a virtuous people, praying to a righteous God. The exceptional might came from a truly exceptional spirit. The abundance of courage came from an abundance of faith. The great deeds of an Army came from the great depths of their love. As they confronted their fate, the Americans and the Allies placed themselves into the palm of God's hand. The men behind me will tell you that they are just the lucky ones. As one of them recently put it, \"All the heroes are buried here.\" But we know what these men did. We knew how brave they were. They came here and saved freedom, and then, they went home and showed us all what freedom is all about. The American sons and daughters who saw us to victory were no less extraordinary in peace. They built families. They built industries. They built a national culture that inspired the entire world. In the decades that followed, America defeated communism, secured civil rights, revolutionized science, launched a man to the moon, and then kept on pushing to new frontiers. And, today, America is stronger than ever before. (Applause.) Seven decades ago, the warriors of D-Day fought a sinister enemy who spoke of a thousand-year empire. In defeating that evil, they left a legacy that will last not only for a thousand years, but for all time , for as long as the soul knows of duty and honor; for as long as freedom keeps its hold on the human heart. To the men who sit behind me, and to the boys who rest in the field before me, your example will never, ever grow old. (Applause.) Your legend will never tire. Your spirit , brave, unyielding, and true , will never die. The blood that they spilled, the tears that they shed, the lives that they gave, the sacrifice that they made, did not just win a battle. It did not just win a war. Those who fought here won a future for our nation. They won the survival of our civilization. And they showed us the way to love, cherish, and defend our way of life for many centuries to come. Today, as we stand together upon this sacred Earth, we pledge that our nations will forever be strong and united. We will forever be together. Our people will forever be bold. Our hearts will forever be loyal. And our children, and their children, will forever and always be free. May God bless our great veterans. May God bless our Allies. May God bless the heroes of D-Day. And may God bless America. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1348853\/remarks-by-president-trump-on-the-75th-commemoration-of-d-day&speechType=1","Summary":"Veterans Arts, Entertainment, and History","Source":null,"Location":"Colleville-sur-Mer, France","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-75th-commemoration-d-day\/","CleanText":"President Macron, Mrs. Macron, and the people of France; to the First Lady of the United States and members of the United States Congress; to distinguished guests, veterans, and my fellow Americans: We are gathered here on Freedom's Altar.

And it's really a tremendous honor to be with you today, along with Vice President Pence and Mrs. Pence. We're deeply honored, again, to host members of Congress and your families right here at the annual White House Congressional Picnic , something that's been taking place for a long time. And we've never had a better-looking crowd, I must say. (Laughter and applause.) There's been a lot of power over the years, standing on that lawn, but there's nobody that looks like you. (Laughter.) But I'm a little prejudiced. That's okay. We love you all. For more than two years, I've had the privilege to develop very close friendships with many of you, and valued partnerships that so many of you have , I think most of you have liked. We've had a tremendous relationship. We've done tremendous work together , passed so many things and helped so many people. It's a great feeling, and I think you have a great feeling, too. We've done a lot of work together. And thank you very much. Really appreciate it. (Applause.) The fact is, there are too many friends here to recognize all of you, but I want to thank each and every one for your service in the great halls of our democracy and for joining us in celebration this afternoon and this evening. Stay as long as you like. Have a good time. The White House is a beautiful place at night. It's something. You just enjoy yourselves with your families. I also want to take this opportunity to thank all of the congressional spouses , you know what I mean , for their service. You have done some job. (Applause.) I must say this: Without you, it doesn't happen, and they would never happen. So congratulations. Thank you all very much. And this evening, we're blessed to be gathered at a truly exciting time in America and American history. So many things are happening and so many great things are happening for our country. Working together over the past two years, we've made extraordinary progress expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens. Since the election, we have created nearly 6 million jobs. Nobody would have said that's possible. If we went back two and a half and three years, during campaigning, if I ever used the expression \"6 million jobs,\" they would have said, \"Can't happen.\" But it did. And it's soon going to be far more than that, by the way , (applause) , based on all of the companies that are pouring into our country. They all want to be where the action is. Unemployment has reached the lowest level in over 50 years. African American, Asian American, and Hispanic American unemployment have all reached the lowest rates in the history of our country. Who would have thought that? (Applause.) And you made it possible. We passed tax cuts and the Jobs Act, the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We doubled the child , and you know this; I think everybody out there knows this, and you benefited , we doubled the child tax credit and the standard deduction. Does anybody care about that? I think so. I think so. (Applause.) The average family of four, earning $75,000, has received a tax cut of more than $2,000 each year. And to ensure that no American community is left behind, we passed Opportunity Zones. We worked with Senator Tim Scott. He was terrific. And we did a real job. We did a real job. (Applause.) We brought reform to our criminal justice system with the FIRST STEP Act. And people said that wasn't going to happen. They've been trying to pass it for a long time. You know, the problems that we've had with criminal justice and criminal justice reform. We got it passed. And we're now helping former prisoners to rejoin their families and restart their lives. There's never been a time like this. People in prison have had a hard time coming out, and oftentimes would have to go back in. They couldn't get jobs. They couldn't get employment. And now, because our economy is perhaps the greatest economy we've ever had in the history of our country, they come out, they're getting jobs. And I want to tell you, we get the reports; employers are thrilled. They said we should have done this a long time ago. So that's been a great, great thing. Thank you very much for helping on that. (Applause.) And, very importantly, working with the First Lady and our great Vice President, we passed historic legislation to combat the opioid and drug addiction crisis. We're working very, very hard on that. Opioid , we're down 17 percent from last year. Who would have thought that? Seventeen percent , a big number. (Applause.) And to give critically ill patients access to breakthrough cures, we passed Right to Try. You don't want to , (applause) , have to use it, but if you do , you know, people were going all over the world, looking for help. They were ill. They were terminally ill. They were very, very sick. And we have the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest labs in the world. And they were forced, because we couldn't give them potential cures , cures that were looking good but weren't finished with the approval process. And now they have Right to Try. They are able to use our medicines early , in many cases, far earlier than the approval process would allow. And we have had unbelievable success. And we're very proud of Right to Try. (Applause.) Thank you. You got it passed. You got it passed. And we worked hard to spread hope throughout the Heartland, helping our strong farmers and ranchers through the Farm Bill that we passed. (Applause.) And as a few people know , as you know, we passed 16 billion dollars' worth of help for our farmers who have been hurt by the situation in China. People don't realize what we did, but we do and the farmers do. Sixteen billion dollars , because that was the amount that they got hurt by , from the fight we're having , or \"skirmish,\" let's call it , and winning with China. And we took care of our farmers. (Applause.) And I know our farmers are very appreciative. That hasn't happened before. But we're doing very well in our trade deals. But we have , and I tell you, I call them \"Patriot Farmers.\" We had a meeting in the White House. We had 25 or 26 farmers. Great-looking people, by the way. And they were in the White House, and I said, \"Well, we're going to help you and we're going to subsidize.\" They said, \"Sir, we don't want subsidy. We just want a level playing field. Nobody can do what we can do.\" And that's what we're giving them. We're giving them a level playing field , and maybe more than that. That's okay, too. (Applause.) But they just want a level playing field. We passed record funding to rebuild our great military, with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year, to support our warriors and to defend freedom and our great American flag. Thank you very much for that because that is what it's all about. (Applause.) And for 44 years, they tried to pass VA Choice. They couldn't get it done. Our great veterans were not treated properly for a long period of time. And do you notice how calm it's been? I shouldn't say this because the opposing party or people in opposition may not like it. But do you notice how calm it's been , how happy our veterans seem to be? I've never seen a period of peace or happiness by our veterans like I've seen over the last year. And to a certain extent, it's starting. We signed it about seven months ago. VA Choice. Rather than waiting on line for days and weeks and, in some cases, months, if there is a line, our great veterans can now leave the VA, go outside, get a great doctor, have whatever is necessary done, we pay the bill, and they go back and they're happy. We're taking care of our veterans , the first time. First time. (Applause.) They've been trying to get that passed for many, many years. And also VA Accountability. If we had somebody working at the VA who was bad to our veterans , didn't treat our veterans right , maybe, in some cases, even sadistic. We had all sorts of things happening. There was absolutely nothing you could do to get them out of the system. And now, we look at them and we say, \"You're fired. Get out.\" We take care of our veterans. (Applause.) So these are more than political victories. These are really national victories. These are victories for our country. We had a lot of them. We could go on for a long time. We could go point after point after point. No administration, in the first two and a half years, has done what this administration has done. And I thank you because you're the ones that got it done for us, and we appreciate it. We really appreciate it. (Applause.) So, in particular, I want to thank you for your service to our country and its citizens. That's why you were sent to Washington. You were sent to Washington to help. You were sent to Washington because you're special people, because you know how to get things done. And working together, we've gotten more done , just about, I think, more done in two and a half years than anybody else, any other administration. You look at our first two years, through Congress. What's been passed has been , in some cases, they call it a miracle. So I want to thank you all very much. And for this afternoon and this evening, let us put politics aside, enjoy the company of our friends and, to a certain extent, our competitors , and that's okay , here on these magnificent grounds. And let us thank God for the incredible blessing of being able to call America the greatest nation , greatest nation in the world. And, by the way, we're making it even greater. I like that. We're making it even greater. (Applause.) But I just want to wish you a very special thanks. You have been fantastic. The job you did is really , during the last period of time , is really incredible. And I have to say this: The people out there , we have a lot of them; we're getting close to the 350 million mark , they really respect you and they really appreciate the job that you're doing. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) And Mr. Vice President and Karen, thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you.

And it's really a tremendous honor to be with you today, along with Vice President Pence and Mrs. Pence. We're deeply honored, again, to host members of Congress and your families right here at the annual White House Congressional Picnic , something that's been taking place for a long time. And we've never had a better-looking crowd, I must say. (Laughter and applause.) There's been a lot of power over the years, standing on that lawn, but there's nobody that looks like you. (Laughter.) But I'm a little prejudiced. That's okay. We love you all. For more than two years, I've had the privilege to develop very close friendships with many of you, and valued partnerships that so many of you have , I think most of you have liked. We've had a tremendous relationship. We've done tremendous work together , passed so many things and helped so many people. It's a great feeling, and I think you have a great feeling, too. We've done a lot of work together. And thank you very much. Really appreciate it. (Applause.) The fact is, there are too many friends here to recognize all of you, but I want to thank each and every one for your service in the great halls of our democracy and for joining us in celebration this afternoon and this evening. Stay as long as you like. Have a good time. The White House is a beautiful place at night. It's something. You just enjoy yourselves with your families. I also want to take this opportunity to thank all of the congressional spouses , you know what I mean , for their service. You have done some job. (Applause.) I must say this: Without you, it doesn't happen, and they would never happen. So congratulations. Thank you all very much. And this evening, we're blessed to be gathered at a truly exciting time in America and American history. So many things are happening and so many great things are happening for our country. Working together over the past two years, we've made extraordinary progress expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens. Since the election, we have created nearly 6 million jobs. Nobody would have said that's possible. If we went back two and a half and three years, during campaigning, if I ever used the expression '6 million jobs,' they would have said, 'Can't happen.' But it did. And it's soon going to be far more than that, by the way , (applause) , based on all of the companies that are pouring into our country. They all want to be where the action is. Unemployment has reached the lowest level in over 50 years. African American, Asian American, and Hispanic American unemployment have all reached the lowest rates in the history of our country. Who would have thought that? (Applause.) And you made it possible. We passed tax cuts and the Jobs Act, the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We doubled the child , and you know this; I think everybody out there knows this, and you benefited , we doubled the child tax credit and the standard deduction. Does anybody care about that? I think so. I think so. (Applause.) The average family of four, earning $75,000, has received a tax cut of more than $2,000 each year. And to ensure that no American community is left behind, we passed Opportunity Zones. We worked with Senator Tim Scott. He was terrific. And we did a real job. We did a real job. (Applause.) We brought reform to our criminal justice system with the FIRST STEP Act. And people said that wasn't going to happen. They've been trying to pass it for a long time. You know, the problems that we've had with criminal justice and criminal justice reform. We got it passed. And we're now helping former prisoners to rejoin their families and restart their lives. There's never been a time like this. People in prison have had a hard time coming out, and oftentimes would have to go back in. They couldn't get jobs. They couldn't get employment. And now, because our economy is perhaps the greatest economy we've ever had in the history of our country, they come out, they're getting jobs. And I want to tell you, we get the reports; employers are thrilled. They said we should have done this a long time ago. So that's been a great, great thing. Thank you very much for helping on that. (Applause.) And, very importantly, working with the First Lady and our great Vice President, we passed historic legislation to combat the opioid and drug addiction crisis. We're working very, very hard on that. Opioid , we're down 17 percent from last year. Who would have thought that? Seventeen percent , a big number. (Applause.) And to give critically ill patients access to breakthrough cures, we passed Right to Try. You don't want to , (applause) , have to use it, but if you do , you know, people were going all over the world, looking for help. They were ill. They were terminally ill. They were very, very sick. And we have the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest labs in the world. And they were forced, because we couldn't give them potential cures , cures that were looking good but weren't finished with the approval process. And now they have Right to Try. They are able to use our medicines early , in many cases, far earlier than the approval process would allow. And we have had unbelievable success. And we're very proud of Right to Try. (Applause.) Thank you. You got it passed. You got it passed. And we worked hard to spread hope throughout the Heartland, helping our strong farmers and ranchers through the Farm Bill that we passed. (Applause.) And as a few people know , as you know, we passed 16 billion dollars' worth of help for our farmers who have been hurt by the situation in China. People don't realize what we did, but we do and the farmers do. Sixteen billion dollars , because that was the amount that they got hurt by , from the fight we're having , or 'skirmish,' let's call it , and winning with China. And we took care of our farmers. (Applause.) And I know our farmers are very appreciative. That hasn't happened before. But we're doing very well in our trade deals. But we have , and I tell you, I call them 'Patriot Farmers.' We had a meeting in the White House. We had 25 or 26 farmers. Great-looking people, by the way. And they were in the White House, and I said, 'Well, we're going to help you and we're going to subsidize.' They said, 'Sir, we don't want subsidy. We just want a level playing field. Nobody can do what we can do.' And that's what we're giving them. We're giving them a level playing field , and maybe more than that. That's okay, too. (Applause.) But they just want a level playing field. We passed record funding to rebuild our great military, with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year, to support our warriors and to defend freedom and our great American flag. Thank you very much for that because that is what it's all about. (Applause.) And for 44 years, they tried to pass VA Choice. They couldn't get it done.

{"SpeechID":"VSDT2462019482","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2019-06-24","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump at Signing of Executive Order on Iran Sanctions","Type":"speech","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you very much. In a few moments, I'll be signing an executive order imposing hard-hitting sanctions on the Supreme Leader of Iran and the Office of the Supreme Leader of Iran, and many others. Today's action follows a series of aggressive behaviors by the Iranian regime in recent weeks, including shooting down of U.S. drones. They shot down the drone. It's , I guess everyone saw that one. And many other things. They've done many other things aside from the individual drone. You saw the tankers, and we know of other things that were done also, which were not good and not appropriate. The Supreme Leader of Iran is one who ultimately is responsible for the hostile conduct of the regime. He's respected within his country. His office oversees the regime's most brutal instruments, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Sanctions imposed through the executive order that I'm about to sign will deny the Supreme Leader and the Supreme Leader's Office, and those closely affiliated with him and the office, access to key financial resources and support. The assets of Ayatollah Khamenei and his office will not be spared from the sanctions. These measures represent a strong and proportionate response to Iran's increasingly provocative actions. We will continue to increase pressure on Tehran until the regime abandons its dangerous activities and its aspirations, including the pursuit of nuclear weapons, increased enrichment of uranium, development of ballistic missiles, engagement in and support for terrorism, fueling of foreign conflicts, and belligerent acts directed against the United States and its allies. The agreement that was signed was a disaster. It was not doing what it was supposed to do. Many bad things were taking place. And, most importantly, it was so short-term that, within a very short number of years, they would be able to make nuclear weapons. And that's unacceptable. Never can Iran have a nuclear weapon. Also included in this is we want the stoppage immediately of their sponsoring of terrorism. They sponsor terrorism at a level that nobody has ever seen before, and that's been over the last number of years. And they've taken all of that money that was given to them by the past administration, and much of it was given out to terrorist organizations. In fact, I remember when John Kerry was asked a question about whether or not this money will be spent for terror. He actually said \"yes\" , or at least he was referring to some of it. But he said, \"Yes, it will be used for terror,\" if you can believe that. We're giving them money. We're saying, \"Yes, it can be used for terror.\" That was not a good answer, but that was the least of it, frankly. So, America is a peace-loving nation. We do not seek conflict with Iran or any other country. I look forward to the day when sanctions can be finally lifted and Iran can become a peaceful, prosperous, and productive nation. That can go very quickly; it can be tomorrow. It can also be in years from now. So I look forward to discussing whatever I have to discuss with anybody that wants to speak. In the meantime, who knows what's going to happen. I can only tell you we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon. And it won't happen. And secondly, and very importantly, we don't want money going out to sponsor terror. They are the number-one sponsor of terror anywhere in the world. So I'll sign this order right now. And I want to thank our military. I want to thank all of the people that have been working with me over the last number of months on this. I think a lot of restraint has been shown by us. A lot of restraint. And that doesn't mean we're going to show it in the future. But I felt that we want to give this a chance , give it a good chance, because I think Iran, potentially, has a phenomenal future. Just , and I say that about North Korea, too. I've said it about North Korea. I think North Korea has a phenomenal future. And I think Iran also has a phenomenal future. And we'd would like to , I think a lot of people would like to see them get to work on that great future. So I'll sign this now. And I appreciate you all being here. Thank you. (The executive order is signed.) Okay. Thank you very much, everybody. Q Mr. President, is your goal to negotiate a new deal with Iran? THE PRESIDENT: We would love to be able to negotiate a deal if they want to. If they don't want to, that's fine too. But we would love to be able to. And, frankly, they might as well do it soon. But, obviously, the people of Iran are great people. You know, I know many of them. I lived in New York. I haven't been there very much the last two and a half years, but I know many Iranians living in New York and they're fantastic people. I have many friends that are Iranian, and it's just very sad what's happening to that country. The deal should've never been done. It wasn't ratified by Congress. It wasn't properly done, as you know. As a treaty, it wasn't properly done. It was incorrectly done. But we'll get it properly done. So we'll see what happens. I hope it's going to be for the good. But the people in Iran are great people, and all of the people I know , so many, in New York , these are great people. Okay. Anything else? Q Sir, just to be clear, is this the U.S. response to the Iranians shooting down the drone? THE PRESIDENT: This, you can probably, Steve, add that into it, but basically this is something that was going to happen anyway. Q If they reach the uranium limits on the 27th, will you take additional action? THE PRESIDENT: I won't say what I'll do, but I don't think they should do it. Q What is your message for the Supreme Leader? And do you want a meeting with him one-on-one? THE PRESIDENT: My only message is this: He has the potential to have a great country, and quickly. Very quickly. And I think they should do that rather than going along this very destructive path. Destructive for everybody. Destructive for everybody. We can't let them have a nuclear weapon. He said he doesn't want nuclear weapons. It's a great thing to say. But a lot of things have been said over the years, and it turns out to be not so. But he said very openly and plainly for everyone to hear that he does not want to have nuclear weapons. So, if that's the case, we can do something very quickly. Okay? Thank you very much everybody. Q What was your letter to Kim Jong Un? THE PRESIDENT: He sent me birthday wishes. But it was just a very friendly letter both ways. We have a really good relationship.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1352507\/remarks-by-president-trump-at-signing-of-executive-order-on-iran-sanctions&speechType=1","Summary":"National Security Foreign Affairs","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-signing-executive-order-iran-sanctions\/","CleanText":"Okay, thank you very much.

Trump is Tearing Down Red Tape in Order to Build More Affordable Housing","Type":"statement","RawText":"\"We're lifting up forgotten communities, creating exciting new opportunities, and helping every American find their path to the American Dream.\" - President Donald J. Trump BREAKING GROUND ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING: President Donald J. Trump is working to eliminate barriers that are holding back affordable housing development. President Trump is signing an executive order to establish a White House Council on Eliminating Barriers to Affordable Housing Development.The council will consist of members from across 8 Federal agencies and will be chaired by Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Ben Carson.This new council will engage with State, local, and tribal leaders to identify and remove obstacles that impede the development of new affordable housing.The Council will look at the affect Federal, State, and local regulations are having on the costs of developing affordable housing and the economy.At the President's direction, the Council will take action to reduce Federal regulatory barriers to affordable housing development.The Council will support State and local efforts to reduce regulatory barriers.The Council will recommend ways to reduce statutory, regulatory, and administrative burdens at all levels of government that hinder affordable housing development.Creating this Council will streamline interagency processes and deliver results even faster.CUTTING EXCESSIVE COSTS TO SPUR CONSTRUCTION: Regulations are creating excessive costs that are holding back the development of needed affordable housing. Many of the markets with the most severe shortages in affordable housing have the most restrictive State and local regulatory barriers to development.More than 25% of the cost of a new home is the direct result of Federal, State, and local regulations, with the price tag even reaching up to 42% for some new multifamily construction.Costly regulations have contributed to a shortage of affordable homes.Census Bureau data shows that from 2010 to 2016, only seven homes were built for every 10 households formed.High housing prices are a primary determinant of homelessness, and research has directly linked more stringent housing market regulation to higher homelessness rates.HELPING AMERICANS FIND A HOME: President Trump is building on efforts his Administration has taken to lift up all Americans and make it easier for them to find a home. Earlier this year, President Trump signed a memorandum to initiate needed reforms to our housing finance system.President Trump is working to improve Americans' access to sustainable home mortgages.The Trump Administration is committed to enabling Americans to access Federal housing programs that help them finance the purchase of their first home.In 2018, HUD launched a campaign to encourage more landlords to participate in the Housing Voucher Program, the country's largest rental subsidy program.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1354403\/president-donald-j-trump-is-tearing-down-red-tape-in-order-to-build-more-affordable-housing&speechType=6","Summary":"Federal, State and Local Relations Housing and Property","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/president-donald-j-trump-tearing-red-tape-order-build-affordable-housing\/","CleanText":"'We're lifting up forgotten communities, creating exciting new opportunities, and helping every American find their path to the American Dream.' - President Donald J.

America's economic revival under President Trump serves as an example for how other nations can achieve growth.Pro-growth policies, like our tax reform, have added millions of new jobs, brought back our manufacturing sector, and restored confidence in the American economy.The United States prospers when the world economy is growing , ensuring strong and stable markets for American goods and services.Countries should focus on implementing pro-growth policies that will help spur their economies, such as reforming their tax laws, cutting regulations, and fostering currency stability.Additionally, nations can better unlock their full economic potential by investing in training to upskill and reskill workers for high-demand industries.ACHIEVING FAIR AND RECIPROCAL TRADE: President Trump is committed to promoting fair and reciprocal trade. The President's commitment to promoting free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals is a key component of his pro-jobs, pro-growth strategy.President Trump is working to open new markets for American goods and services, while ensuring any deal is enforceable and creates a level playing field for our workers and companies.The United States is working with allies and partners to confront unfair trade practices, including intellectual property theft, unfair labor practices, and forced technology transfer.President Trump will encourage our allies and partners to lower tariff and non-tariff barriers to free, fair, and reciprocal trade.The United States is urging reforms and modernizations to the World Trade Organization (WTO), while making sure the WTO functions as originally intended.ENCOURAGING INNOVATION: President Trump is committed to encouraging growth in the digital marketplace and supporting emerging technologies in order to promote future prosperity. Emerging technologies, like artificial intelligence, have the potential to make a positive, meaningful impact on living standards and productivity for the United States and the world.Recognizing the importance of these technologies, President Trump signed an executive order earlier this year on maintaining leadership in artificial intelligence.Overly burdensome regulations can stifle innovation and limit the potential of these transformative technologies to fuel economic growth.To that end, the United States is committed to promoting innovation-friendly policies that support growth in the digital economy and pave the way for technological innovation.The United States urges members of the G20 to work together to advance an open, fair, market-based digital economy, which will benefit all our nations through the free flow of data.PROMOTING ENERGY DEVELOPMENT: President Trump will use the G20 Summit to advance his \"all-of-the-above\" approach to energy development.

Empowering women to participate in the world economy is vital to economic prosperity, national security, and global stability.The United States is committed to eliminating legal and cultural barriers that are holding women back from full and free participation in their local economies.Countries should recognize that stability is only realized when women and men alike are able to participate economically and politically at all levels.The Trump Administration is helping to lead this drive through our Women's Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative.President Trump launched this landmark Initiative in February 2019, which seeks to economically empower 50 million women across the developing world by 2025.SUPPORTING SMART DEVELOPMENT WORLDWIDE: President Trump supports the use of transparent, accountable, and market-based financial development principles. President Trump is committed to spurring the private sector to produce more sustainable economic development around the world.Sustainable, private-sector-led economic development provides a strong alternative to state-directed initiatives that come with many strings attached.The United States remains committed to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) process on taxation.The United States condemns the efforts of those that are undermining the OECD process by taking unilateral action to tax digital companies.The President is supporting efforts to combat corruption and increase transparency among our allies and partners.Countries should level the playing field for development by adopting and enforcing strong anti-corruption laws.The United States supports efforts by the G20 to promote a transparent, responsible, and sustainable approach to infrastructure development financing that does not saddle developing countries with crippling debt.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1354416\/president-donald-j-trump-will-promote-worldwide-economic-growth-and-prosperity-at-the-g20-summit&speechType=6","Summary":"Foreign Affairs Trade","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/president-donald-j-trump-will-promote-worldwide-economic-growth-prosperity-g20-summit\/","CleanText":"'So together, let us resolve to use our power, our resources, and our voices, not just for ourselves, but for our people , to lift their burdens, to raise their hopes, and to empower their dreams.' - President Donald J.

The First Lady and I wish each and every one of you a Happy Independence Day on this truly historic Fourth of July! (Applause.) Today, we come together as one nation with this very special Salute to America. We celebrate our history, our people, and the heroes who proudly defend our flag , the brave men and women of the United States Military. (Applause.) We are pleased to have with us Vice President Mike Pence and his wonderful wife Karen. (Applause.) We are also joined by many hardworking members of Congress; Acting Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and many other members of my Cabinet; and also the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joe Dunford. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Lieutenant General Daniel Hokanson of the National Guard and distinguished leaders representing each branch of the United States Armed Forces: the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marines, and, very soon, the Space Force. (Applause.) As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that we all share a truly extraordinary heritage. Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told: the story of America. It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true. It is the chronicle of brave citizens who never give up on the dream of a better and brighter future. And it is the saga of thirteen separate colonies that united to form the most just and virtuous republic ever conceived. (Applause.) On this day, 243 years ago, our Founding Fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to declare independence and defend our God-given rights. (Applause.) Thomas Jefferson wrote the words that forever changed the course of humanity: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\" (Applause.) With a single sheet of parchment and 56 signatures, America began the greatest political journey in human history. But on that day, the patriots who would determine the ultimate success of the struggle were a hundred miles away in New York. There, the Continental Army prepared to make its stand, commanded by the beloved General George Washington. (Applause.) As the delegates debated the Declaration in Philadelphia, Washington's army watched from Manhattan as a massive British invading fleet loomed dangerously across New York harbor. The British had come to crush the revolution in its infancy. Washington's message to his troops laid bare the stakes. He wrote: \"The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and conduct of this army We have, therefore, to resolve to conquer or die.\" (Applause.) Days later, General Washington ordered the Declaration read aloud to the troops. The assembled soldiers just joined an excited crowd running down Broadway. They toppled a statue of King George and melted it into bullets for battle. The faraway King would soon learn a timeless lesson about the people of this majestic land: Americans love our freedom and no one will ever take it away from us. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT: That same American spirit that emboldened our founders has kept us strong throughout our history. To this day, that spirit runs through the veins of every American patriot. It lives on in each and every one of you here today. It is the spirit of daring and defiance, excellence and adventure, courage and confidence, loyalty and love that built this country into the most exceptional nation in the history of the world, and our nation is stronger today than it ever was before. (Applause.) It is its strongest now. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT: That same righteous American spirit forged our glorious Constitution. That rugged American character led the legendary explorers, Lewis and Clark, on their perilous expedition across an untamed continent. It drove others to journey West and stake out their claim on the wild frontier. Devotion to our founding ideals led American patriots to abolish the evil of slavery, secure civil rights, and expand the blessings of liberty to all Americans. (Applause.) This is the noble purpose that inspired Abraham Lincoln to rededicate our nation to a new birth of freedom, and to resolve that we will always have a government of, by, and for the people. (Applause.) Our quest for greatness unleashed a culture of discovery that led Thomas Edison to imagine his lightbulb, Alexander Graham Bell to create the telephone, the Wright Brothers to look to the sky and see the next great frontier. For Americans, nothing is impossible. (Applause.) Exactly 50 years ago this month, the world watched in awe as Apollo 11 astronauts launched into space with a wake of fire and nerves of steel, and planted our great American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are thrilled to have here tonight the famed NASA Flight Director who led Mission Control during that historic endeavor: the renowned Gene Kranz. (Applause.) Gene, I want you to know that we are going to be back on the moon very soon. And someday soon, we will plant the American flag on Mars. (Applause.) It's happening, Gene. It's happening. Our nation's creativity and genius lit up the lights of Broadway and the soundstages of Hollywood. It filled the concert halls and airwaves around the world with the sound of jazz, opera, country, rock and roll, and rhythm and blues. It gave birth to the musical, the motion picture, the Western, the World Series, the Super Bowl, the skyscraper, the suspension bridge, the assembly line, and the mighty American automobile. (Applause.) It led our citizens to push the bounds of medicine and science to save the lives of millions. Here with us this evening is Dr. Emmanuel [Emil] Freireich. When Emmanuel [Emil] began his work, 99 percent of children with leukemia died. Thanks largely to Dr. Freireich's breakthrough treatments, currently 90 percent of those with the most common childhood leukemias survive. Doctor, you are a great American hero. Thank you. (Applause.) Americans always take care of each other. That love and unity held together the first pilgrims, it forged communities on the Great Plains, it inspired Clara Barton to found the Red Cross, and it keeps our nation thriving today. Here tonight from the Florida panhandle is Tina Belcher. Her selfless generosity over 3 decades has made her known to all as \"Mrs. Angel.\" Every time a hurricane strikes, Mrs. Angel turns her tiny kitchen into a disaster relief center. On a single day after Hurricane Michael, she gave 476 people a warm meal. Mrs. Angel, your boundless heart inspires us all. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. From our earliest days, Americans of faith have uplifted our nation. This evening, we are joined by Sister Deirdre Byrne. Sister Byrne is a retired Army surgeon who served for nearly 30 years. On September 11th, 2001, the sister raced to Ground Zero. Through smoke and debris, she administered first aid and comfort to all. Today, Sister Byrne runs a medical clinic serving the poor in our nation's capital. Sister, thank you for your lifetime of service. Thank you. (Applause.) Our nation has always honored the heroes who serve our communities: the firefighters, first responders, police, sheriffs, ICE, Border Patrol, and all of the brave men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.) On this July 4th, we pay special tribute to the military service members who laid down their lives for our nation. We are deeply moved to be in the presence this evening of Gold Star families whose loved ones made the supreme sacrifice. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Throughout our history, our country has been made ever greater by citizens who risked it all for equality and justice. 100 years ago this summer, the women's suffrage movement led Congress to pass the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote. (Applause.) In 1960, a thirst for justice led African American students to sit down at the Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. (Applause.) It was one of the very first civil rights sit-ins and it started a movement all across our nation. Clarence Henderson was 18-years-old when he took his place in history. Almost six decades later, he is here tonight in a seat of honor. Clarence, thank you for making this country a much better place for all Americans. (Applause.) In 1963, Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., stood here on these very steps and called on our nation to live out the \"true meaning of its creed,\" and \"let freedom ring\" for every citizen all across our land. America's fearless resolve has inspired heroes who defined our national character , from George Washington, John Adams, and Betsy Ross, to Douglass , you know, Fredrick Douglass , (applause) , the great Frederick Douglas, Harriet Tubman, Amelia Earhart, Douglas MacArthur, Dwight Eisenhower, Jackie Robinson, and, of course, John Glenn. (Applause.) It has willed our warriors up mountains and across minefields. It has liberated continents, split the atom, and brought tyrants and empires to their knees. Here with us this evening is Earl Morse. After retiring from the Air Force, Earl worked at a VA hospital in Ohio. Earl found that many World War Two veterans could not afford to visit their memorial on the National Mall. So Earl began the very first \"Honor Flights,\" that have now brought over 200,000 World War Two heroes to visit America's monument. Earl, thank you. We salute you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Earl. Thank you. Our warriors form a hallowed roll call of American patriots, running all the way back to the first souls who fought and won American independence. Today, just as it did 243 years ago, the future of American freedom rests on the shoulders of men and women willing to defend it. We are proudly joined tonight by heroes from each branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, including three recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. They, and thousands before us, served with immense distinction, and they loved every minute of that service. To young Americans across our country, now is your chance to join our military and make a truly great statement in life. And you should do it. (Applause.) We will now begin our celebration of the United States Armed Forces, honoring each branch's unique culture, rich history, service song, and distinct legacy. I invite Acting Secretary , please , Mark Esper, Secretary of Defense; and Chairman Dunford, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , please join me. (Applause.) In August of 1790, by request of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, Congress established a fleet of ten swift vessels to defend our shores. These Revenue Cutters would fight pirates, stop smugglers, and safeguard our borders. They are the ancestors of our faithful Coast Guard. (Applause.) When our ships were seized and sailors kidnapped by foreign powers in 1812, it was a Revenue Cutter , the swift schooner Thomas Jefferson , that swept in to capture the first British vessel of the war. In 1897, when 265 whalers were trapped in ice , and the ice fields of Alaska were closing up , courageous officers trekked fifteen hundred miles through the frozen frontier to rescue those starving men from a certain death. In 1942, the Coast Guard manned landing craft for invasions in the Pacific. When the enemy attacked U.S. Marines from the shores of Guadalcanal, Coast Guard Signalman First Class Douglas Munro used his own boat to shield his comrades from pounding gunfire. Munro gave his life; hundreds of Marines were saved. As he lay dying on the deck, his final question embodied devotion that sails with every Coast Guardsman: \"Did they get off?\" (Applause.) On D-Day, the Coast Guard's famous Matchbox Fleet served valiantly through every hour of the greatest amphibious invasion in the history of our country. One coxswain said \"the water boiled with bullets like a mud puddle in a hailstorm,\" but still the Coast Guard braved death to put our boys on Utah and Omaha beaches. Every Coast Guardsman is trusted to put service before all. Coasties plunge from helicopters, and barrel through pouring rain and crashing waves to save American lives. They secure our borders from drug runners and terrorists. In rough seas, at high speeds, their sharpshooters take out smugglers' engines with a single shot. They never miss. When the red racing stripes of a Coast Guard vessel break the horizon, when their chopper blades pierce the sky, those in distress know that the help is on their way, and our enemies know their time has come. (Applause.) These guardians of our waters stand, Semper Paratus. (Applause.) They are always ready. They are the United States Coast Guard. Representing the Coast Guard today, you will soon see an HH-60 Jayhawk helicopter based at Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater, along with an HH-65 Dolphin from Air Station Atlantic City, and an HC-144 Ocean Sentry from Air Station Miami. (\"Semper Paratus\" is played with a flyover.) Thank you. Thank you to the Coast Guard. On a cold December morning in 1903, a miracle occurred over the dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, when two bicycle makers from Ohio defied gravity with a 12 horsepower engine, wings made of cotton, and just a few dollars in their pockets. Just six years later, America was training its first pilots to take these magnificent machines up and over the field of battle. In World War One, our flyboys rushed the skies of Europe, and aces like Eddie Rickenbacker filled hearts and headlines with tales of daring duels in the clouds. General Billy Mitchell saw the promise of this technology, and risked court martial in his quest for an independent air force. He was proven right when empires across the oceans tried to carve up the world for themselves, and America stood in the way. We wouldn't let it happen. (Applause.) After Pearl Harbor, Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle and his raiders flew B-25 bombers off a carrier deck in the deep Pacific in a daring feat of American resolve. And, as President Roosevelt said, the Nazis built a fortress around Europe, \"but [they] forgot to put a roof on it.\" (Applause.) So we crushed them all from the air. One hundred and seventy-seven Liberator Bombers flew dangerously low, through broad daylight without fighter protection, to cripple the Nazi war machine at Ploie\u0219ti. More than 300 airmen gave their lives to destroy the enemy oil refineries. And five pilots were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for their actions in that single raid. (Applause.) It was airman Chuck Yeager who first broke the sound barrier. It was airmen like Gus Grissom and Buzz Aldrin, who traded their Sabre jets for rockets to the stars. And it is our incredible airmen today who wield the most powerful weapons systems on the planet Earth. For over 65 years, no enemy air force has managed to kill a single American soldier because the skies belong to the United States of America. (Applause.) No enemy has attacked our people without being met by a roar of thunder, and the awesome might of those who bid farewell to Earth, and soar into the wild blue yonder. They are the United States Air Force. Representing the Air Force you will soon see beautiful, brand new F-22 Raptors from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia , (applause) , and one magnificent B-2 Stealth Bomber from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. (Applause.) (\"The U.S. Air Force\" is played with a flyover.) What a great country. In October of 1775, the Continental Congress ordered the construction of two swift-sailing vessels, each carrying 10 cannons and 80 men, to sail eastward. Our young fleet tested their sea legs against the most powerful navy the world had ever seen. John Paul Jones, America's first great naval hero, said: \"I wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast; for I intend to go in harm's way.\" He got his wish many times when his ship was shot into pieces off the coast of England by a British vessel and her four dozen guns. When demanded to surrender, Jones very famously declared \"I have not yet begun to fight!\" (Applause.) When our Navy begins fighting, they finish the job. The War of 1812: Captain James Lawrence fell with his brothers on USS Chesapeake. His dying command gained immortality, \"Don't give up the ship.\" (Applause.) In the Battle of Mobile Bay, Admiral David Farragut lashed himself to the rigging of his flagship to see beyond the cannon smoke, crying, \"Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.\" (Applause.) In World War Two, it was aviators launched from the carrier Enterprise, Hornet, and Yorktown who filled the skies of Midway and turned the tide of the Pacific War. Nobody could beat us. Nobody could come close. On D-Day, Seabee engineers came ashore to destroy blockades and barriers, making way for the invasion. Many lost their lives, but they took the German defenses with them, and our men crushed upon the beaches like a mighty storm. From the Naval demolition units of World War Two arose a force that became famous in the Mekong Delta. They don't want to see our force again. The very best of the very best: the Navy SEALs. (Applause.) It was the SEALs who delivered vengeance on the terrorist who planned the September 11th attack on our homeland. It was the SEALs who stand ready to bring righteous retribution , in mountain, jungle, desert , to those who do us harm. America's sailors are not born. They are forged by the sea. Their traditions are rich with the salt and blood of three centuries. When Old Glory crests the waves of foreign shores, every friend and every foe knows that justice sails those waters. It sails with the United States Navy. (Applause.) Representing our great Navy today will be two F-18 Super Hornets from Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia, along with two F-35 Lightning's from Naval Air Station Lemoore in California. (\"\"Anchors Aweigh\" is played with a flyover.) So great. In November of 1775, the Continental Congress created two battalions of a new kind of warrior , one who kept and would protect our ships and sailors, and be at home both ashore and in the mast, with musket in hand. Their versatility was proven in the War of Independence, when 234 Continental Marines conducted their first amphibious raid, capturing the British supply of gunpowder and cannons at Fort Nassau. Ever since, Marines have fought in every American war. Their legend has grown and grown and grown with each passing year. It was the Marines who won America's first overseas battle, vanquishing Barbary pirates on the shores of Tripoli. Their high, stiff collar, which shielded them from the pirates' sword, earned them the immortal name: Leatherneck. (Applause.) It was the Marines who, after two long days of battle, marched through the Halls of Montezuma. It was the Marines who took heavy casualties to kick the Kaiser's troops out of Belleau Wood in World War One, earning the title \"Devil Dogs.\" (Applause.) And it was the Marines who raised the flag on the black sands of Iwo Jima. (Applause.) From the Chosin Reservoir to Khe Sanh, from Helmand to Baghdad, Marines have struck fear into the hearts of our enemies and put solace into the hearts of our friends. Marines always lead the way. After the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, which claimed the lives of 241 great U.S. servicemen, Marine Sergeant Jeffrey Nashton lay in bandages , so badly wounded, barely alive. When the Commandant of the Marine Corps came to visit his hospital, Sergeant Nashton had to feel the General's collar; he wanted to feel his four stars. He could not see and he could not speak. He signaled for pen and paper, and with shaking hand he wrote two words: Semper Fi. (Applause.) That motto, Semper Fidelis , \"Always Faithful\" , burns in the soul of every Marine, a sacred promise the Corps has kept since the birth of our country. They are the elite masters of air and land and sea, on battlefields across the globe. They are the United States Marines. (Applause.) Representing the Marine Corps today will be a brand new VH-92, soon to serve as Marine One , (applause) , along with two V-22 Ospreys from the famed HMX-1 helicopter squadron at Quantico, the \"Nighthawks.\" (\"Marines' Hymn\" is played with a flyover.) In June of 1775, the Continental Congress created a unified army out of the revolutionary forces encamped around Boston and New York, and named after the great George Washington, Commander-in-Chief. The Continental Army suffered the bitter winter of Valley Forge, found glory across the waters of the Delaware, and seized victory from Cornwallis of Yorktown. Our Army manned the (inaudible) , it manned the ramparts. It took over the airports. It did everything it had to do. And at Fort McHenry, under the rockets' red glare, it had nothing but victory. And when dawn came, their Star Spangled Banner waved defiant. (Applause.) At Shiloh, Antietam, and Gettysburg, our soldiers gave the last full measure of devotion for the true unity of our nation and the freedom of all Americans. (Applause.) In the trenches of World War One, an Army Sergeant named Alvin York faced an inferno of enemy fire and refused to retreat. He said, \"I won't leave. I won't stop.\" He shot his rifle 18 times, killing 18 of the enemy. When they fixed bayonets and charged, he killed seven more. The entire German machine gun battalion surrendered because of one man, Alvin York. A generation later, the Army returned to Europe, and embarked upon a great crusade. With knives and rifles in hand, the Rangers scaled the cliffs of Normandy. The 101st Airborne leapt into the danger from above, illuminated only by enemy flares, explosions, and burning aircraft. They threw back the Nazi empire with lightning of their own, from the turrets of Sherman tanks and the barrels of the M1 rifle. In the darkness of the Battle of the Bulge, with Nazis on every side, one soldier is reported to have said: \"They've got us surrounded again, the poor bastards.\" (Laughter and applause.) Outnumbered, American warriors fought through the bunkers of Pork Chop Hill and held the line of civilization in Korea. In the elephant grass of Vietnam, the First Cavalry made its stand amid a forest consumed in flame, with enemies at every single turn. The Army brought America's righteous fury down to Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and cleared the bloodthirsty killers from their caves. They liberated Fallujah and Mosul, and helped liberate and obliterate the ISIS caliphate, just recently, in Syria. One hundred percent gone. (Applause.) Through the centuries, our soldiers have always pointed towards home, proclaiming, \"This We'll Defend.\" They live by the creed of Douglas MacArthur: \"In war, there is no substitute for victory.\" They are the greatest soldiers on Earth. (Applause.) (\"The Army Goes Rolling Along\" is played with a flyover.) Nearly 250 years ago, a volunteer army of farmers and shopkeepers, blacksmiths, merchants, and militiamen risked life and limb to secure American liberty and self-government. This evening, we have witnessed the noble might of the warriors who continue that legacy. They guard our birthright with vigilance and fierce devotion to the flag and to our great country. Now we must go forward as a nation with that same unity of purpose. As long as we stay true to our cause, as long as we remember our great history, as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America cannot do. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. We will always be the people who defeated a tyrant, crossed a continent, harnessed science, took to the skies, and soared into the heavens because we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. (Applause.) The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free. We are one people, chasing one dream, and one magnificent destiny. We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same Almighty God. (Applause.) And from the banks of the Chesapeake to the cliffs of California, from the humming shores of the Great Lakes to the sand dunes of the Carolinas, from the fields of the Heartland to the everglades of Florida, the spirit of American independence will never fade, never fail, but will reign forever and ever and ever. (Applause.) So once more, to every citizen throughout our land: Have a glorious Independence Day. Have a great Fourth of July. I want to thank the Army Band, the National Park Service, the Interior Department, the incredible pilots overhead, and those who are making possible the amazing fireworks display later this evening. Now, as the band plays \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,\" I invite the First Lady, Vice President and Mrs. Pence, the Service Secretaries and military leaders to join me onstage for one more salute to America by the famous, incredible, talented Blue Angels. (Applause.) God bless you. God bless the military. And God bless America. Happy Fourth of July. (\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" is played with a flyover.) END","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1355089\/remarks-by-president-trump-at-a-salute-to-america&speechType=1","Summary":"Arts, Entertainment, and History","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-salute-america\/","CleanText":"Hello, America. Hello. The First Lady and I wish each and every one of you a Happy Independence Day on this truly historic Fourth of July! (Applause.) Today, we come together as one nation with this very special Salute to America. We celebrate our history, our people, and the heroes who proudly defend our flag , the brave men and women of the United States Military. (Applause.) We are pleased to have with us Vice President Mike Pence and his wonderful wife Karen. (Applause.) We are also joined by many hardworking members of Congress; Acting Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and many other members of my Cabinet; and also the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joe Dunford. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Lieutenant General Daniel Hokanson of the National Guard and distinguished leaders representing each branch of the United States Armed Forces: the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marines, and, very soon, the Space Force. (Applause.) As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that we all share a truly extraordinary heritage. Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told: the story of America. It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true. It is the chronicle of brave citizens who never give up on the dream of a better and brighter future. And it is the saga of thirteen separate colonies that united to form the most just and virtuous republic ever conceived. (Applause.) On this day, 243 years ago, our Founding Fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to declare independence and defend our God-given rights. (Applause.) Thomas Jefferson wrote the words that forever changed the course of humanity: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.' (Applause.) With a single sheet of parchment and 56 signatures, America began the greatest political journey in human history. But on that day, the patriots who would determine the ultimate success of the struggle were a hundred miles away in New York. There, the Continental Army prepared to make its stand, commanded by the beloved General George Washington. (Applause.) As the delegates debated the Declaration in Philadelphia, Washington's army watched from Manhattan as a massive British invading fleet loomed dangerously across New York harbor. The British had come to crush the revolution in its infancy. Washington's message to his troops laid bare the stakes. He wrote: 'The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and conduct of this army We have, therefore, to resolve to conquer or die.' (Applause.) Days later, General Washington ordered the Declaration read aloud to the troops. The assembled soldiers just joined an excited crowd running down Broadway. They toppled a statue of King George and melted it into bullets for battle. The faraway King would soon learn a timeless lesson about the people of this majestic land: Americans love our freedom and no one will ever take it away from us. (Applause.) That same American spirit that emboldened our founders has kept us strong throughout our history. To this day, that spirit runs through the veins of every American patriot. It lives on in each and every one of you here today. It is the spirit of daring and defiance, excellence and adventure, courage and confidence, loyalty and love that built this country into the most exceptional nation in the history of the world, and our nation is stronger today than it ever was before. (Applause.) It is its strongest now. (Applause.) That same righteous American spirit forged our glorious Constitution. That rugged American character led the legendary explorers, Lewis and Clark, on their perilous expedition across an untamed continent. It drove others to journey West and stake out their claim on the wild frontier. Devotion to our founding ideals led American patriots to abolish the evil of slavery, secure civil rights, and expand the blessings of liberty to all Americans. (Applause.) This is the noble purpose that inspired Abraham Lincoln to rededicate our nation to a new birth of freedom, and to resolve that we will always have a government of, by, and for the people. (Applause.) Our quest for greatness unleashed a culture of discovery that led Thomas Edison to imagine his lightbulb, Alexander Graham Bell to create the telephone, the Wright Brothers to look to the sky and see the next great frontier. For Americans, nothing is impossible. (Applause.) Exactly 50 years ago this month, the world watched in awe as Apollo 11 astronauts launched into space with a wake of fire and nerves of steel, and planted our great American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are thrilled to have here tonight the famed NASA Flight Director who led Mission Control during that historic endeavor: the renowned Gene Kranz. (Applause.) Gene, I want you to know that we are going to be back on the moon very soon. And someday soon, we will plant the American flag on Mars. (Applause.) It's happening, Gene. It's happening. Our nation's creativity and genius lit up the lights of Broadway and the soundstages of Hollywood. It filled the concert halls and airwaves around the world with the sound of jazz, opera, country, rock and roll, and rhythm and blues. It gave birth to the musical, the motion picture, the Western, the World Series, the Super Bowl, the skyscraper, the suspension bridge, the assembly line, and the mighty American automobile. (Applause.) It led our citizens to push the bounds of medicine and science to save the lives of millions. Here with us this evening is Dr. Emmanuel Freireich. When Emmanuel began his work, 99 percent of children with leukemia died. Thanks largely to Dr. Freireich's breakthrough treatments, currently 90 percent of those with the most common childhood leukemias survive. Doctor, you are a great American hero. Thank you. (Applause.) Americans always take care of each other. That love and unity held together the first pilgrims, it forged communities on the Great Plains, it inspired Clara Barton to found the Red Cross, and it keeps our nation thriving today. Here tonight from the Florida panhandle is Tina Belcher. Her selfless generosity over 3 decades has made her known to all as 'Mrs. Angel.' Every time a hurricane strikes, Mrs. Angel turns her tiny kitchen into a disaster relief center. On a single day after Hurricane Michael, she gave 476 people a warm meal. Mrs. Angel, your boundless heart inspires us all. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. From our earliest days, Americans of faith have uplifted our nation. This evening, we are joined by Sister Deirdre Byrne. Sister Byrne is a retired Army surgeon who served for nearly 30 years. On September 11th, 2001, the sister raced to Ground Zero. Through smoke and debris, she administered first aid and comfort to all. Today, Sister Byrne runs a medical clinic serving the poor in our nation's capital. Sister, thank you for your lifetime of service. Thank you. (Applause.) Our nation has always honored the heroes who serve our communities: the firefighters, first responders, police, sheriffs, ICE, Border Patrol, and all of the brave men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.) On this July 4th, we pay special tribute to the military service members who laid down their lives for our nation. We are deeply moved to be in the presence this evening of Gold Star families whose loved ones made the supreme sacrifice. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Throughout our history, our country has been made ever greater by citizens who risked it all for equality and justice. 100 years ago this summer, the women's suffrage movement led Congress to pass the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote. (Applause.) In 1960, a thirst for justice led African American students to sit down at the Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. (Applause.) It was one of the very first civil rights sit-ins and it started a movement all across our nation. Clarence Henderson was 18-years-old when he took his place in history. Almost six decades later, he is here tonight in a seat of honor. Clarence, thank you for making this country a much better place for all Americans. (Applause.) In 1963, Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., stood here on these very steps and called on our nation to live out the 'true meaning of its creed,' and 'let freedom ring' for every citizen all across our land. America's fearless resolve has inspired heroes who defined our national character , from George Washington, John Adams, and Betsy Ross, to Douglass , you know, Fredrick Douglass , (applause) , the great Frederick Douglas, Harriet Tubman, Amelia Earhart, Douglas MacArthur, Dwight Eisenhower, Jackie Robinson, and, of course, John Glenn. (Applause.) It has willed our warriors up mountains and across minefields. It has liberated continents, split the atom, and brought tyrants and empires to their knees. Here with us this evening is Earl Morse. After retiring from the Air Force, Earl worked at a VA hospital in Ohio. Earl found that many World War Two veterans could not afford to visit their memorial on the National Mall. So Earl began the very first 'Honor Flights,' that have now brought over 200,000 World War Two heroes to visit America's monument. Earl, thank you. We salute you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Earl. Thank you. Our warriors form a hallowed roll call of American patriots, running all the way back to the first souls who fought and won American independence. Today, just as it did 243 years ago, the future of American freedom rests on the shoulders of men and women willing to defend it. We are proudly joined tonight by heroes from each branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, including three recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. They, and thousands before us, served with immense distinction, and they loved every minute of that service. To young Americans across our country, now is your chance to join our military and make a truly great statement in life. And you should do it. (Applause.) We will now begin our celebration of the United States Armed Forces, honoring each branch's unique culture, rich history, service song, and distinct legacy. I invite Acting Secretary , please , Mark Esper, Secretary of Defense; and Chairman Dunford, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , please join me. (Applause.) In August of 1790, by request of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, Congress established a fleet of ten swift vessels to defend our shores. These Revenue Cutters would fight pirates, stop smugglers, and safeguard our borders. They are the ancestors of our faithful Coast Guard. (Applause.) When our ships were seized and sailors kidnapped by foreign powers in 1812, it was a Revenue Cutter , the swift schooner Thomas Jefferson , that swept in to capture the first British vessel of the war. In 1897, when 265 whalers were trapped in ice , and the ice fields of Alaska were closing up , courageous officers trekked fifteen hundred miles through the frozen frontier to rescue those starving men from a certain death. In 1942, the Coast Guard manned landing craft for invasions in the Pacific. When the enemy attacked U.S. Marines from the shores of Guadalcanal, Coast Guard Signalman First Class Douglas Munro used his own boat to shield his comrades from pounding gunfire. Munro gave his life; hundreds of Marines were saved. As he lay dying on the deck, his final question embodied devotion that sails with every Coast Guardsman: 'Did they get off?' (Applause.) On D-Day, the Coast Guard's famous Matchbox Fleet served valiantly through every hour of the greatest amphibious invasion in the history of our country. One coxswain said 'the water boiled with bullets like a mud puddle in a hailstorm,' but still the Coast Guard braved death to put our boys on Utah and Omaha beaches. Every Coast Guardsman is trusted to put service before all. Coasties plunge from helicopters, and barrel through pouring rain and crashing waves to save American lives. They secure our borders from drug runners and terrorists. In rough seas, at high speeds, their sharpshooters take out smugglers' engines with a single shot. They never miss. When the red racing stripes of a Coast Guard vessel break the horizon, when their chopper blades pierce the sky, those in distress know that the help is on their way, and our enemies know their time has come. (Applause.) These guardians of our waters stand, Semper Paratus. (Applause.) They are always ready. They are the United States Coast Guard. Representing the Coast Guard today, you will soon see an HH-60 Jayhawk helicopter based at Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater, along with an HH-65 Dolphin from Air Station Atlantic City, and an HC-144 Ocean Sentry from Air Station Miami. ('Semper Paratus' is played with a flyover.) Thank you. Thank you to the Coast Guard. On a cold December morning in 1903, a miracle occurred over the dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, when two bicycle makers from Ohio defied gravity with a 12 horsepower engine, wings made of cotton, and just a few dollars in their pockets. Just six years later, America was training its first pilots to take these magnificent machines up and over the field of battle. In World War One, our flyboys rushed the skies of Europe, and aces like Eddie Rickenbacker filled hearts and headlines with tales of daring duels in the clouds. General Billy Mitchell saw the promise of this technology, and risked court martial in his quest for an independent air force. He was proven right when empires across the oceans tried to carve up the world for themselves, and America stood in the way. We wouldn't let it happen. (Applause.) After Pearl Harbor, Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle and his raiders flew B-25 bombers off a carrier deck in the deep Pacific in a daring feat of American resolve. And, as President Roosevelt said, the Nazis built a fortress around Europe, 'but forgot to put a roof on it.' (Applause.) So we crushed them all from the air. One hundred and seventy-seven Liberator Bombers flew dangerously low, through broad daylight without fighter protection, to cripple the Nazi war machine at Ploie\ufffdti. More than 300 airmen gave their lives to destroy the enemy oil refineries. And five pilots were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for their actions in that single raid. (Applause.) It was airman Chuck Yeager who first broke the sound barrier. It was airmen like Gus Grissom and Buzz Aldrin, who traded their Sabre jets for rockets to the stars. And it is our incredible airmen today who wield the most powerful weapons systems on the planet Earth. For over 65 years, no enemy air force has managed to kill a single American soldier because the skies belong to the United States of America. (Applause.) No enemy has attacked our people without being met by a roar of thunder, and the awesome might of those who bid farewell to Earth, and soar into the wild blue yonder. They are the United States Air Force. Representing the Air Force you will soon see beautiful, brand new F-22 Raptors from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia , (applause) , and one magnificent B-2 Stealth Bomber from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. (Applause.) ('The U.S. Air Force' is played with a flyover.) What a great country.

When demanded to surrender, Jones very famously declared 'I have not yet begun to fight!' (Applause.) When our Navy begins fighting, they finish the job. The War of 1812: Captain James Lawrence fell with his brothers on USS Chesapeake. His dying command gained immortality, 'Don't give up the ship.' (Applause.) In the Battle of Mobile Bay, Admiral David Farragut lashed himself to the rigging of his flagship to see beyond the cannon smoke, crying, 'Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.' (Applause.)

Thank you. Before I begin, I want to apprise everyone of an incident in the Strait of Hormuz today involving USS Boxer, a Navy amphibious assault ship. The Boxer took defensive action against an Iranian drone, which had closed into a very, very near distance, approximately 1,000 yards, ignoring multiple calls to stand down and was threatening the safety of the ship and the ship's crew. The drone was immediately destroyed. This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters. The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, our facilities, and interests, and calls upon all nations to condemn Iran's attempts to disrupt freedom of navigation and global commerce. I also call on other nations to protect their ships as they go through the Strait, and to work with us in the future. Thank you very much. I thought you should you know that. I'm honored to be here with Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands , fantastic country; incredibly successful country , and so many of our Dutch friends who have come with Mark. I want to thank you all for being with us in the East Room of the White House. Thank you all for being here. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you also to Vice President Pence and Acting Secretary of Defense Richard Spencer for joining us. Thank you, Richard, Mike. Last month, Melania and I traveled to the United Kingdom and France to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of D-Day. Together, we paid tribute to every courageous patriot who fought to liberate Europe from the evil of Nazi rule. Today, on behalf of the American people, I will receive an American flag that flew aboard a ship carrying the first waves of United States service members to land in Normandy. Seventy-five years after that momentous day , and that is truly a momentous day; one of the most powerful, most important days in the history of our world , it is my honor to welcome this great American flag back home where it belongs. I want to thank the Prime Minister, as well as U.S. Ambassador Peter Hoekstra. Pete, thank you. Thank you very much, Peter. You're doing a great job. And Dutch Ambassador Hendrik Schuwer, for being here today and for their devoted efforts to deepen the abiding ties between the United States and the Netherlands. Our relationship has never been closer than it is today. We are also profoundly moved to be joined by several incredible World War Two veterans who helped defeat the Nazis and save freedom for all humanity. With us is Jack Goldstein, who served in Europe during the war. Jack? Where's Jack? (Applause.) Thank you, Jack. Thank you. Thank you very much, Jack. Along with Steven Melnikoff and Harold Angle, both veterans of the Normandy campaign. (Applause.) Thank you very much, fellas. And they went on to fight in the Netherlands. Thank you, fellas. That's incredible. Thank you all three. You look great. Young guys. (Laughter.) Thank you very much. This event would not be possible without the extraordinary generosity of the flag's two donors from the Netherlands: Mr. Bert Kreuk, and his uncle and business partner, Mr. Theo Schols. And I want to thank you very much. Where are they? Thank you very much. That's great. (Applause.) Very much, thank you.And thank you for preserving our history and for watching over the immortal legacy of our D-Day heroes. That's what you did. Thank you. And I know it was expensive. Two rich people, I assume, right? (Laughter.) Huh? I appreciate it. Thank you. On June 6, 1944, the flag we receive today flew aboard Landing Craft Control 60. And it was approached, and when it approached Utah Beach , I was there very recently with the First Lady, and it was something incredible to see. Commanding the ship was a young Navy lieutenant, two days shy of his 27th birthday, named Howard Vander Beek. Amid treacherous German minefields, raging winds, and rough seas, Lieutenant Vander Beek and his crew led an astonishing 19 waves of American troops and equipment to those very, very dangerous beaches. Through it all, this flag soared proudly above the waters of the English Channel, announcing the arrival of our American warriors. After completing his mission on D-Day, Lieutenant Vander Beek took the flag , now bearing the scars of German machinegun fire and stained, all over it, with dirt and diesel and blood. He carried it with him in his backpack for the remainder of the war and kept the flag until his death in 2014. Soon after, the flag was purchased at auction by Mr. Kreuk and Mr. Schols, whose relatives were among the hundreds of Dutch who perished in the German bombings of Rotterdam in 1940. These two gentlemen paid half a million dollars to obtain the flag, just so they could return it as a gift to the American people and to the United States of America. As they explained, they wanted to thank the United States for the extraordinary sacrifice our service members made to liberate their nation and all of Europe in World War Two. So nice. Thank you very much. So nice. Thousands of Americans gave their lives on D-Day, and many thousands more gave their lives to drive the Nazis from the Netherlands. Following today's ceremony, the extraordinary flag will be displayed at the Smithsonian's Museum of American History , and very proudly. With us this afternoon are Secretary of the Smithsonian, a friend of mine, Lonnie Bunch. Lonnie, thank you very much for being here. (Applause.) And Director of the Museum of American History, Anthea Hartig. Anthea, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. And I know they will take great care of this priceless American artifact. Thank you very much for being here, both. I know they share Mr. Kreuk's vision for the flag. As he said, it will tell visitors from around the world about the story of freedom. With their help, this wonderful flag will be preserved forever and ever in American history, as it should be. It will always be a reminder of the supreme sacrifice of our warriors, and the beautiful friendship between the Dutch and the American people. And now, I would like to introduce a very special man, a man I've gotten to know very well during our strong negotiations on trade and our negotiations on the military and NATO and all of the other things we've been talking about for so long, it seems like right now. A Prime Minister who is very, very popular in his country. A great gentleman. And you're going to say a few words, and then Mr. Kreuk and Secretary Bunch will tell us more about the treasured gift that they presented us with. So I want to thank you all, and God bless America. Mr. Prime Minister?

I've heard for many years, the world's largest building. And it's under great leadership. Your devotion, strength, and courage keep America safe, strong, and free. It's because of you that the United States military is the most powerful fighting force on the face of the Earth. I want to express our gratitude to the Old Guard and to all of the service members in today's review for their extraordinary commitment to excellence and their unwavering loyalty to our nation. It is the greatest honor of my life to serve as your Commander-in-Chief. Let me also recognize the incredible U.S. Navy Sea Chanters and the band for that beautiful rendition of our National Anthem. It was really beautiful, and thank you very much. Fantastic job. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. We're gathered here today to celebrate the swearing-in of America's new Secretary of Defense, Mark T. Esper. Secretary Esper, your lifetime of noble service has prepared you for this immense responsibility. And that's what it is: immense responsibility. On behalf of our entire country, thank you and congratulations. Congratulations. (Applause.) I have no doubt , I know you well , that you will thrive in the performance of your duties and make all Americans , everybody in this great country , all Americans very, very proud. They're right now very proud, but they're going to be even more so as time goes by. People love our country more than ever, and our country is respected again. Remember that. I'm delighted that many members of your family could be here for this special occasion, including your wonderful wife Leah, your mother Polly, and your children Luke and Katherine. Thank you. Thank you very much. Congratulations to a great family. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Great family. Also joining us are Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, Acting Administrator Chris Pilkerton, Director Dan Coats, representatives Kay Granger, John Rice Carter, and many members of the diplomatic corps. With us, as well, are many distinguished military leaders: Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Paul Selva. Where is Paul? Paul? Paul. Acting Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy. Ryan? Hi, Ryan. Stand up, Ryan. You're doing a great job. (Applause.) You're filling big shoes, Ryan. Acting Secretary of the Air Force Matthew Donovan. Thank you very much. Thank you, Secretary. (Applause.) Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly. Thank you, Thomas. Great. (Applause.) Army Chief of Staff, General Mark Milley. Mark? Thank you, Mark. (Applause.) Congratulations to Mark. Coast Guard Commandant, Admiral Karl Shultz. Thank you, Admiral. (Applause.) Marine Corps Commandant, General David Berger. General, thank you very much. (Applause.) Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Goldfein. General, thank you very much. (Applause.)And Chief of Naval Operations Admiral, John Richardson. Thank you all. Thank you, Admiral. (Applause.) Over many decades, in times of war and peace, Mark Esper has answered the call of duty. He's never failed. He hails from Uniontown, Pennsylvania , the hometown of his personal hero, the legendary former Secretary of Defense and a great one, George Marshall. Mark attended the United States Military Academy at West Point. Graduated in 1986, receiving a commission in the infantry. Soon, he earned his tab , Ranger Tab , and fought with the famed 101st Airborne Division in the Gulf War. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the Combat Infantryman Badge for his service. Brave guy. They all told me he was a brave guy. I knew that anyway. In total, Mark served in our nation's military for 21 years. He completed his final active-duty assignment right here at the Pentagon on the Army staff and then returned six years later as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Negotiations Policy. Over his career, Mark has advanced our national security in a variety of other government and private sector roles. He has worked in both houses of Congress, advising lawmakers. I can see he had some talent because he won , was it 98 to what? No, you got 90, right? Can you believe this? I don't believe it. I heard a \"Ninety.\" Ninety to eight, right? (Applause.) I don't know. I haven't heard that sound in a long time, Mark. (Laughter.) Now I'm worried. Ninety to eight. Wow. He served as Vice President of Raytheon. Along the way, Mark earned a master's degree at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government and a PhD at George Washington University. In 2017, Mark was sworn in as Secretary of the United States Army, a position in which he earned universal admiration and respect. Tremendous respect. At the Department of Defense, Secretary Esper will work with more than 2 million service members and hundreds of thousands of civilian employees all dedicated to one critical mission: the defense of the nation and of this great nation's people. I have absolute confidence that Mark will ensure that our incredible military is fully prepared to deter conflict and to defeat any foe. No enemy can match the awesome might of the American Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and the United States Marines. We had a budget approved when I first came in. Billions and billions of dollars more than it was previously, in the previous administration: $700 billion. Then I went to $716 billion. And I won't even tell you what this one is. I can only tell you it's even more. Because we have rebuilt things that nobody ever even thought of rebuilding. We've added the greatest planes in the world, the greatest missiles in the world. We've upgraded our nuclear very, very powerfully, including new. We never want to have to use it. Pray to God that we never have to use it. But we have the best in the world in every aspect of military. The sight of American warriors brings solace into the hearts of our friends and strikes fear into the hearts of our enemies. Our military today is more powerful, by far, than ever before. And three years ago, we could not have said that, could we, Mark? We're giving our warfighters the tools they need to fight and win with overwhelming force. After years and years of budget cuts and all of the things that they've been doing to set us back with our military, we have more than made up for all of it. We're building new tanks and ships and submarines and planes and missile systems to ensure that our warriors operate with unrivaled capability in conflict. Any battlefield will be a battlefield on which we win. We have given our service members their largest pay raise in nearly a decade. And under this administration, we have faced the challenge of our time with clear eyes, fresh thinking, and bold determination. Our first priority is always the safety and sovereignty of our nation and our citizens. Here at home, we have deployed military forces to confront the grave national security crisis on our southern border. And I want to thank all of the great military leaders for the help you've given us on our southern border. And, as you know, Mexico has now deployed 21,000 troops, which is something they've never done before. And they've been a tremendous help. Tremendous difference in the numbers , very rapidly. And we want to thank the country of Mexico and the President. No nation can be safe or secure that fails to control its borders. In Syria and Iraq, thanks to the bravery of our warriors and their allies, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent and just absolutely destroyed. And we did it in a very quick moment of time. As soon as I said, \"I want to do it and I want to do it fast,\" our military kicked in and it happened very, very quickly. Today, we stand not far from where terrorists attacked the Pentagon on 9\/11, claiming 184 precious lives. We will never forget the immortal sacrifice of those American patriots. We vow to do whatever it takes to protect our homeland, to safeguard our people from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, and to preserve American freedom. Around the world, America faces new threats and strategic rivals, it seems like all the time. We have met this competition with unmatched confidence, purpose, and resolve. We talk to all of them and they talk to us with great, great respect. They respect our country so much more than they have for many, many decades. Right now, they respect us more than they have in many, many years. And it's only going to get more so. We are ensuring American dominance across every warfighting domain , land, air, sea, cyber, and now space. That is why, under Secretary Esper's leadership, we will , as Mike and Mark have already said, but it's so exciting to say. And whenever I make a speech, people start going wild. They stand up and they clap, and I can't sit them down. And I have to wait because I say, \"We're launching the United States Space Force.\" They go absolutely wild. They understand that's where it's going to be at. And we're going to be there, and we're going to be there in every way that you can. As we aim ever higher, I know the men and women of this department will never let up and never rest easy. Together, we will fulfill our sacred mission to protect the greatest nation in the history of the world: the United States of America. With unyielding strength, we will defend our country, we will defend our people, and we will proudly defend our great American flag. Secretary Esper, congratulations again to you and your family. This is an incredible day in the life and fabled history of the United States. Secretary of Defense, do you ever see that, looking into , do you ever see that one? As I watch all of these great men and women , you're going to do a great job, I have no doubt. Absolutely no doubt. (Applause.) No doubt. We cannot wait to see all that you will achieve for our nation as the new Secretary of Defense. I want to thank everybody for being here. Very special people. God bless you. God bless our military. And God bless America. Thank you very much everybody. (Applause.) Thank you.

Well, thank you very much, everybody. Please, sit down. Very important day. And we're gathered this morning at the White House to honor our solemn duty to America's best, bravest, and finest, who I know so well. In a few moments, I will sign a bipartisan bill to fully reauthorize the 9\/11 Victims Compensation Fund. So, the 9\/11 Victims Compensation Fund is something you've all worked on very hard, and the day has come. Today, we come together as one nation to support our September 11th heroes, to care for their families, and to renew our eternal vow: Never, Ever Forget. Before I go further, this morning we express our deepest sadness and sorrow for the families who lost a precious loved one in the horrific shooting last night in Gilroy, California. While families were spending time together at a local festival, a wicked murderer opened fire and killed three innocent citizens, including a young child. We grieve for their families and we ask that God will comfort them with his overflowing mercy and grace. We're praying for those who are recovering right now in the hospital. Some very, very serious injuries. We thank the brave members of law enforcement , they never let us down , who swiftly killed the shooter. We reaffirm our national will to answer violence with the courage, determination, and resolve of one American family. We will continue to work together as communities and as citizens to stop evil, prevent violence, and protect the safety of all Americans. We're joined for today's ceremony by our wonderful Vice President, Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike, very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Along with many distinguished guests. I want to begin by recognizing a leader many of you know very well. On September 11th, he declared, \"The city of New York and the United States of America is much stronger than any group of barbaric terrorists our strength and our willingness to defend ourselves will ultimately prevail.\" And he was right. A great mayor of the city of New York , our greatest mayor, in my opinion. Now, what do I know? (Laughter.) Rudy Giuliani. Stand up, Rudy. (Applause.) Great job, Rudy. Great job. Rudy has got a lot of guts. Thanks also to Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen for being here. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you very much. Along with Senator Deb Fischer and Representatives Michael Burgess, Chris Collins, Brian Fitzpatrick, Peter King, John Joyce, Mark Meadows, and Dan Meuser. Please stand up, fellas. Please. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Peter. In the wake of the September 11th attacks, courageous Americans raced into smoke, fire, and debris in lower Manhattan, the Pentagon, and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The whole world witnessed the might and resilience of our nation in the extraordinary men and women of the New York Fire Department and the New York Police Department, selfless patriots of unmatched character and devotion. I grew up with them so I can tell you that's absolutely true. It's always nice to really know your subject. I know that subject. These are great people. We also commemorate the heroes of the Port Authority Police. And I want to thank you all for being here. Tremendous people. The first responders from across the country rushed to New York and worked endless days and sleepless nights. They fought to rescue every person trapped in the rubble, and then searched for months to find the remains of the fallen. The love and loyalty of our 9\/11 responders knew no bounds. Today, we are deeply honored to be in the presence of more than 60 of these exceptional heroes. They answered terror with the emotional strength of true American warriors. Would every 9\/11 responder please stand up? Please, all you first responders. (Applause.) Wow. Great. Thank you. Thank you, fellas. Great-looking group of people you are. Great-looking group of people. Thank you very much. You inspire all of humanity, and you know that. We're also greatly moved to have with us families of our fallen heroes. Our nation owes each of you a profound debt that no words or deeds will ever repay. But we can and we will keep our nation's promise to you. In a few moments, I will sign the 9\/11 Victims Compensation Fund. This law makes permanent the financial support for families who lost precious loved ones as a result of September 11th attacks. It also provides pensions for those who are suffering from cancer and other illnesses stemming from the toxic debris they were exposed to in the aftermath of the attacks. Many of those affected were firefighters, police officers, and other first responders. And I was down there also, but I'm not considering myself a first responder. But I was down there. I spent a lot of time down there with you. Since September 11th, we have lost more than 2,000 first responders and survivors to 9\/11-related cancers and illnesses. Currently, thousands of men and women are battling cancer and other illnesses due to 9\/11. We pledge to stand by the families of those affected, today and every day. We will stand with you. I want to thank lawmakers in both parties for working with common purpose to pass this vital and critical legislation. Here with us for this signing ceremony are the three families whose loved ones are memorialized in the title of this bill. New York Police Department Detective James Zadroga spent more than 450 hours serving at Ground Zero. In 2006, James died from a lung disease. To his father Joseph, and his daughter Tyler Ann, who join us: Detective Zadroga's heroism will uplift our nation forever. He won't be forgotten. We will always remember what he did for us. Please stand up. Please. Please. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Also present today is the family of East Meadow Volunteer Firefighter Ray Pfeifer. I know East Meadow very well. Great place. Great people. For eight months, Ray worked constantly at Ground Zero. In 2017, at the age of 59, he died from cancer. Here with us today is Ray's wife Caryn, his daughter Taylor, and his son Terence, now a New York City firefighter. Please, stand up. (Applause.) Good. Very good. Thank you. And I know Ray must be watching over you, looking down right now from heaven, on this beautiful Rose Garden. Very, very proud of you. Thank you. Thank you very much. The third namesake of the bill is New York City Detective Luis Alvarez. Last month, his powerful testimony in Congress touched the heart of our nation. A few days later, he passed from this life into eternity. We are privileged to have with us Detective Alvarez's brother Philip and his wife Alaine, and his sons Tyler and Ben. Please, stand. Please. Please. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I want each of you to know that America is holding you in the arms of its wonderful, wonderful heart. And we're all grieving by your side. Our whole nation prays and pays tribute to the incredible life and legacy of Detective Alvarez , how hard he worked and how much he suffered. And we really want to thank him. He was really something. People understood it very well. It's really great. Thank you. We have an obligation, and it's a sacred obligation, to the families and first responders of 9\/11. Here with us today is Chief John Joyce, former fire chief of the Midtown Manhattan firehouse. On September 11th, 15 of his men raced into the ashes of hell and gave their lives. To this day, Chief Joyce still mentors many of their 28 children. Chief Joyce spent seven months working at Ground Zero. In 2011, he was diagnosed with cancer. He has also endured other severe 9\/11-related illnesses. But the Chief is a fighter. He is definitely a fighter. As he says, because of this bill, he does not have to fear for the families of his firehouse whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice. Chief Joyce, you have our everlasting gratitude. Please, Chief. Thank you. Good. (Applause.) Thank you, Chief. Thank you for being here. And say hello to everybody. To every 9\/11 hero, you poured out your heart, your sweat, your soul, and everything you had for your country. You ran toward the wreckage, into a ball of flames, like, frankly, nobody in this country had ever seen. You searched for survivors. You went back day after day and night after night to save lives and return the fallen to their families, to rebuild and recover, and to show the entire world that nothing will ever break America's spirit. Over the last two decades, you have endured hardship with amazing grace and incredible grit. Through it all, you care and you work, and you love, and you will always remember all of those great families. You lift up our communities and you remind us all what it means to stand united as \"one nation under God.\" For your entire lives, you have gone far beyond your duty to us, and today we strive to fulfill our sacred duty to you. We love you. We honor you. And we thank you. God bless you all. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Now I'm going to sign this bill into law. And I don't know if the stage will hold it, but if it doesn't, we're not falling very far. But I'd like to ask the families and I'd also like to ask the first responders to come up, and we'll give , we'll give this stage a shot. Let's see how well built. Made in America. Let's see how well built it is. Okay? Come on up. (The bill is signed.) (Applause.) Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.

My fellow Americans, this morning, our nation is overcome with shock, horror, and sorrow. This weekend, more than 80 people were killed or wounded in two evil attacks. On Saturday morning, in El Paso, Texas, a wicked man went to a Walmart store, where families were shopping with their loved ones. He shot and murdered 20 people, and injured 26 others, including precious little children. Then, in the early hours of Sunday morning in Dayton, Ohio, another twisted monster opened fire on a crowded downtown street. He murdered 9 people, including his own sister, and injured 27 others. The First Lady and I join all Americans in praying and grieving for the victims, their families, and the survivors. We will stand by their side forever. We will never forget. These barbaric slaughters are an assault upon our communities, an attack upon our nation, and a crime against all of humanity. We are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil, the cruelty, the hatred, the malice, the bloodshed, and the terror. Our hearts are shattered for every family whose parents, children, husbands, and wives were ripped from their arms and their lives. America weeps for the fallen. We are a loving nation, and our children are entitled to grow up in a just, peaceful, and loving society. Together, we lock arms to shoulder the grief, we ask God in Heaven to ease the anguish of those who suffer, and we vow to act with urgent resolve. I want to thank the many law enforcement personnel who responded to these atrocities with the extraordinary grace and courage of American heroes. I have spoken with Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, as well as Mayor Dee Margo of El Paso, Texas, and Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, to express our profound sadness and unfailing support. Today, we also send the condolences of our nation to President Obrador of Mexico, and all the people of Mexico, for the loss of their citizens in the El Paso shooting. Terrible, terrible thing. I have also been in close contact with Attorney General Barr and FBI Director Wray. Federal authorities are on the ground, and I have directed them to provide any and all assistance required , whatever is needed. The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate. In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart, and devours the soul. We have asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism , whatever they need. We must recognize that the Internet has provided a dangerous avenue to radicalize disturbed minds and perform demented acts. We must shine light on the dark recesses of the Internet, and stop mass murders before they start. The Internet, likewise, is used for human trafficking, illegal drug distribution, and so many other heinous crimes. The perils of the Internet and social media cannot be ignored, and they will not be ignored. In the two decades since Columbine, our nation has watched with rising horror and dread as one mass shooting has followed another , over and over again, decade after decade. We cannot allow ourselves to feel powerless. We can and will stop this evil contagion. In that task, we must honor the sacred memory of those we have lost by acting as one people. Open wounds cannot heal if we are divided. We must seek real, bipartisan solutions. We have to do that in a bipartisan manner. That will truly make America safer and better for all. First, we must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs. I am directing the Department of Justice to work in partisan , partnership with local, state, and federal agencies, as well as social media companies, to develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike. As an example, the monster in the Parkland high school in Florida had many red flags against him, and yet nobody took decisive action. Nobody did anything. Why not? Second, we must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence. We must stop or substantially reduce this, and it has to begin immediately. Cultural change is hard, but each of us can choose to build a culture that celebrates the inherent worth and dignity of every human life. That's what we have to do. Third, we must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment, but, when necessary, involuntary confinement. Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun. Fourth, we must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms, and that, if they do, those firearms can be taken through rapid due process. That is why I have called for red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. Today, I am also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty, and that this capital punishment be delivered quickly, decisively, and without years of needless delay. These are just a few of the areas of cooperation that we can pursue. I am open and ready to listen and discuss all ideas that will actually work and make a very big difference. Republicans and Democrats have proven that we can join together in a bipartisan fashion to address this plague. Last year, we enacted the STOP School Violence and Fix NICS Acts into law, providing grants to improve school safety and strengthening critical background checks for firearm purchases. At my direction, the Department of Justice banned bump stocks. Last year, we prosecuted a record number of firearms offenses. But there is so much more that we have to do. Now is the time to set destructive partisanship aside , so destructive , and find the courage to answer hatred with unity, devotion, and love. Our future is in our control. America will rise to the challenge. We will always have and we always will win. The choice is ours and ours alone. It is not up to mentally ill monsters; it is up to us. If we are able to pass great legislation after all of these years, we will ensure that those who were attacked will not have died in vain. May God bless the memory of those who perished in Toledo. May God protect them. May God protect all of those from Texas to Ohio. May God bless the victims and their families. May God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Today, our nation honors and mourns the nearly 3,000 lives that were stolen from us on September 11th, 2001. On these grounds, 184 people were murdered when al Qaeda terrorists overtook American Airlines Flight 77 and crashed it into the Pentagon. For every American who lived through that day, the September 11th attack is seared into our soul. It was a day filled with shock, horror, sorrow, and righteous fury. I vividly remember when I first heard the news. I was sitting at home watching a major business television show early that morning. Jack Welch, the legendary head of General Electric, was about to be interviewed when all of a sudden they cut away. At first, there were different reports: It was a boiler fire, but I knew that boilers aren't at the top of a building. It was a kitchen explosion in Windows on the World. Nobody really knew what happened. There was great confusion. I was looking out of a window from a building in Midtown Manhattan, directly at the World Trade Center, when I saw a second plane, at a tremendous speed, go into the second tower. It was then that I realized the world was going to change. I was no longer going to be , and it could never, ever be , that innocent place that I thought it was. Soon after, I went down to Ground Zero with men who worked for me to try to help in any little way that we could. We were not alone. So many others were scattered around trying to do the same. They were all trying to help. But for the families who join us, this is your anniversary of personal and permanent loss. It's the day that has replayed in your memory a thousand times over. The last kiss. The last phone call. The last time hearing those precious words, \"I love you.\" Then the attack. The anguish of knowing your family member had boarded one of these flights or was working in the World Trade Center or serving right here at the Pentagon. You waited, you prayed, you answered that most dreaded call, and your life changed forever. To each of you: The First Lady and I are united with you in grief, we come here in the knowledge that we cannot erase the pain or reverse the evil of that dark and wretched day, but we offer you all that we have: our unwavering loyalty, our undying devotion, and our eternal pledge that your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. Eighteen years ago, the terrorists struck this citadel of power and American strength. But the enemy soon learned that they could not weaken the spirit of our people. In times of distress, the heart of the American patriot only grows stronger and more determined. Even in the midst of the attack, the world witnessed the awesome power of American defiance. Forty passengers and crew on Flight 93 rose up, fought back, and thwarted the enemy's wicked plans. In their final moments, these American heroes thunderously declared that we alone decide our fate. We saw American perseverance in the valiant New York firefighters, police officers, first responders, military, and everyday citizens who raced into the crashing towers to rescue innocent people. One such American was retired Army Colonel Rick Rescorla, who gave his life on 9\/11. Rick earned the Silver Star and the Purple Heart for his service in Vietnam. He later became the Vice President for Security at Morgan Stanley in the World Trade Center. On the day of the attack, Rick died while leading countless others to safety. His selfless actions saved approximately 2,700 lives. Today, I am honored to announce that I will soon be awarding the late Rick Rescorla the Presidential Citizens Medal for his extraordinary sacrifice. Though Rick has left this Earth, we will ensure that the memory of his deeds will never, ever be forgotten. His memory will forever endure. Thank you. Thank you, Rick. (Applause.) Thank you, Rick. Thank you, Rick. Here on the western side of the Pentagon, we saw brave men and women rush into the fire and race into the scorching flames to rescue their colleagues. When evil seeks to do us harm, the incredible men and women of the United States military answer with unyielding valor and unstoppable resolve. Navy Admiral David Thomas crawled through live wires and helped lift a wall of debris to save the life of a colleague. As Admiral Thomas remembers, \"It was the worst day of my life, but the heroism and selfless disregard I saw that [horrible] morning is forever burned in my heart.\" Admiral Thomas, America salutes you and every patriot who defied evil that day. Thank you very much, Admiral. Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Army Ranger Chris Braman repeatedly went back inside the burning building, rescuing one injured person after another. Before he entered, he said a prayer and asked God to give him strength, and then he dove into the suffocating smoke and fumes and flames. At the same time, Sheila Moody had just prayed that someone would find her. Then, she heard Chris's voice. As Sheila says, God sent Chris as her guardian angel. To Sheila and Chris, America is strengthened by your goodness and your grace and your bravery. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. To fulfill our unbreakable promise to every survivor and family of 9\/11, earlier this year, we fully reauthorized the Victims Compensation Fund to the tune of billions and billions of dollars. Since September 11th, nearly 6 million young men and women have joined the United States Armed Forces. They have crossed seas, climbed mountains, trekked through deserts, and rushed into enemy compounds to face down the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Nearly 7,000 service members have laid down their lives to protect our home, our flag, and our American way of life. American freedom survives only because there are patriots willing to sacrifice everything in its defense. No tribute is sufficient to convey the infinite depth of our nation's gratitude. On this solemn day of remembrance, our thoughts also turn to the 200,000 valiant soldiers, sailors, airmen, Coast Guardsmen, and Marines who are now, at this very moment, stationed overseas. We do not seek conflict, but if anyone dares to strike our land, we will respond with the full measure of American power and the iron will of the American spirit. And that spirit is unbreakable. We had peace talks scheduled a few days ago. I called them off when I learned that they had killed a great American soldier from Puerto Rico and 11 other innocent people. They thought they would use this attack to show strength. But actually, what they showed is unrelenting weakness. The last four days, we have hit our enemy harder than they have ever been hit before, and that will continue. (Applause.) And if, for any reason, they come back to our country, we will go wherever they are and use power the likes of which the United States has never used before. And I'm not even talking about nuclear power. They will have never seen anything like what will happen to them. No enemy on Earth can match the overwhelming strength, skill, and might of the American Armed Forces. And we have rebuilt and strengthened the last two and a half years, spending $700 billion, $716 billion, and now, just approved, $738 billion , more money, by far, than ever spent on our armed forces. You are the fearless sentinels who stand watch over all that we cherish and everything we hold sacred, priceless, and dear. This morning, we also give thanks to the dedicated men and women at the Department of Homeland Security. Their Department was created after 9\/11 to help secure our immigration system and ensure that those who threaten our people are denied entry to our shores. We're indebted to every law enforcement official , state, local, and federal , who devotes their life to keeping America safe. As we gather at this moment, and at this incredible memorial, we are reminded that there is no greater testament to our fallen heroes than the presence of their families who knew and loved them so much. Among the family members here today is Stephanie Dunn. Her husband, Navy Commander Patrick Dunn, was one of the patriots who gave his life, right here, 18 years ago. Before he left that morning, Patrick gave Stephanie a big, beautiful kiss. Then, for the first time, he leaned down and kissed her pregnant stomach. Stephanie was just two months along with their first child. Earlier this year, their daughter Allie celebrated her 17th birthday. Allie grew up into a strong, truly remarkable young woman. She mentors the children of our nation's wounded warriors, and recently, I was honored to give Allie the President's Volunteer Service Award for her hundreds of hours of community service. We are blessed to have Allie here with us at today's ceremony. Thank you, Allie. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. And, Allie, I know your dad is watching over you. He's right up there. He's watching from Heaven, looking down right now with love and pride. He is so proud of you. Thank you very much. Incredible. (Applause.) Also joining us is the Vigiano family. For generations, the Vigiano family has served in our military and in the New York City Fire and Police Departments. These are two great departments. I grew up with them. I know. On September 11th, NYPD Detective Joseph Vigiano rushed into the World Trade Center, and died rescuing his fellow citizens. His brother, John, was a New York firefighter. He also gave his life that day at Ground Zero. At the time, Joseph's three sons were just young boys, ages eight, six, and three months old. This morning, they are with us. The youngest, John, just started his freshman year of college at SUNY Maritime College, and he plans to join the military. Joseph, Jr. is a Marine reservist and, just like his father, he is a proud member of the NYPD. And James is a corporal in the Marines. On his last deployment, James was stationed on the USS New York, a ship made using 24 tons of steel from the World Trade Center. Every time he left the mess hall on his way to his bunk, he passed a picture of his dad. To John, Joseph, and James, and to the Vigiano family, you have sacrificed beyond measure, and you will never, ever stop giving back to this country. And thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Very proud of you. Thank you. Thank you very much. The heroes present today remind us of an immortal truth. The future of our nation is secured through the vigilance of our people: The brave men and women who tore through the gates of hell to save the hurt and the wounded. The service members who honor the friends who perished by continuing their exceptional life of service. The moms and dads who endure the loss of their soulmates, and fill their children's lives with all of the adoration in the world. The sons and daughters who suffered grave loss, and yet through it all, persevere to care for our neighbors, defend our homeland, and safeguard our nation. Each of your lives tells the story of courage and character, virtue and valor, resilience and resolve, loyalty and love. This morning, we make a sacred vow to carry on this noble legacy. Today and every day, we pledge to honor our history, to treasure our liberty, to uplift our communities, to live up to our values, to prove worthy of our heroes, and above all, stronger than ever, to never, ever forget. We are now, and will forever be, one American family united by patriotism, bound by destiny, and sustained by the faith of Almighty God. Thank you. God bless you. God bless our military. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you all. Thank you very much. (Applause.)

Today, our nation honors and mourns the nearly 3,000 lives that were stolen from us on September 11th, 2001. On these grounds, 184 people were murdered when al Qaeda terrorists overtook American Airlines Flight 77 and crashed it into the Pentagon. For every American who lived through that day, the September 11th attack is seared into our soul. It was a day filled with shock, horror, sorrow, and righteous fury. I vividly remember when I first heard the news. I was sitting at home watching a major business television show early that morning. Jack Welch, the legendary head of General Electric, was about to be interviewed when all of a sudden they cut away. At first, there were different reports: It was a boiler fire, but I knew that boilers aren't at the top of a building. It was a kitchen explosion in Windows on the World.

(Applause.) That's a group. Some group. AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you. That's fantastic. A lot of power in this room. Wow. A lot of power. Thank you, Kevin, for your friendship and for your devotion to our nation. I'm delighted to be here with so many terrific Republican members of Congress. You really are terrific people. I especially want to thank our amazing leadership team: Republican Whip, and one of the bravest men I know, Steve Scalise. Steve, thank you very much. (Applause.) Conference Chair Liz Cheney. (Applause.) Thank you, Liz. NRCC Chair Tom Emmer. Tom. (Applause.) Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Tom. And Chief Deputy Whip Drew Ferguson. Great job. (Applause.) Thank you, Drew. Great job. I also want to proudly welcome our newest Republican congressmen , two people that fought a big fight for the last number of months, and they're winners. They reacted so incredibly under pressure. The whole world was watching. A lot of people were hoping for the opposite outcome, but many more people were hoping for the outcome that we had. A man who wasn't expected necessarily to win, and then he got in gear and he was brutal and brilliant, and he did a great job. Now, soon to be, and now Congressman Dan Bishop , for many years. Thank you, Dan. (Applause.) Dan, thank you. What a great job. (Applause.) What a great job, Dan. And another man who fought so hard and he was supposed to win by a little tiny bit, a couple of points, and he won by a lot of points. That was a big victory, and I want to just congratulate you. Greg Murphy is going to be with you folks for a long time. (Applause.) These two people are special people. North Carolina , thank you, North Carolina. (Applause.) They were some crowds that turned out. They turned out, and they turned out like people never expected. And they were , that was just a great evening of television. I wouldn't say the fake news was too happy with the outcome, but that's okay. That's okay. We did it. And we worked together as a team, and it was very inspirational for a lot of people to watch. Everyone here tonight has a critical role to play at the vital crossroads of our nation. Democrats in Congress have embraced an extreme, destructive, and dangerous agenda: radical socialism and open borders. Democrats are determined to replicate the most catastrophic failures of world history right here in the United States. They've never learned. They haven't watched. Each of you in the House Republican Conference is on the frontlines defending American freedom, American security, American prosperity, and the American way of life. You're the ones , you're doing the defense. Hundreds of millions of our fellow citizens are counting on us, and, so help us God, we will never, ever let them down. (Applause.) Together, we're going to fight historic battles, and we have historic battles ahead of us. Going to make our country even greater. And we're going to win overwhelming victories for the American people. The spirit that we have in the Republican Party, I don't believe, has ever been this high. Over the past two and a half years, we've already delivered unprecedented progress for citizens of every background and every walk of life. Now we must go directly to the American people to share the story of what we have achieved and to explain our bold vision for the future. Working with Republicans in Congress, we slashed 30,000 pages of regulations from the Federal Register. (Applause.) And that is an all-time record, and we did that in a lot less years. That's an all-time record, no matter how long a President was there. We saved an average American household $3,000. Earlier today, my administration formally repealed the horrible, dangerous, anti-everything Waters of the United States rule. (Applause.) Thank you, Louie. Thank you, Louie. I would say the only thing that had going for it that was good was the title. (Laughter.) That was , I said, \"I'm the only one that would sign this.\" But it was a good thing we did. Right, Louie? It was a good thing we did. Government will no longer try to micromanage every rain puddle and every drainage ditch on private land. They took your land away from you. Together, we enacted the VA Accountability Act, so that anyone who mistreats or abuses our great veterans can be promptly fired. (Applause.) There was a time you couldn't fire anyone, no matter how they treated our veterans, whether they stole or they were sadists. And we had some of them too. You couldn't fire them, and now we can do it very, very quickly and easily. They don't treat our veterans well. We get them out. Since then, we've removed more than 7,600 employees who failed to give our vets the care they so richly deserve. We're also very proud to tell you that the Veterans Choice, which is something special , so special; they've been trying to get it for decades and decades , Choice , so that more veterans have the right to see a private doctor, if they have to wait on line, instead of waiting for two weeks or three weeks or five weeks, or numbers that you wouldn't even believe. Think of it. You're sick, you're not feeling well, and they tell you, \"Come back in four weeks.\" Now you go outside, you go to a local doctor of your choice, by the way , unlike somebody else, where they said, \"You can have your doctor and you can have your plan\" 28 times. That didn't work out too well. (Laughter.) You go out and you see a doctor of your choice. We pay the bill. And it's been an incredible thing. I'll tell you, what's happening at the VA has been really something special. If you look and , you just see it. All you used to see and read about is how bad the VA was run, how horrible it was. And you don't hear those stories anymore. Now, you know, what we'll go is these people will run out and they'll start trying to find somebody. \"Who is unhappy?\" Thousands and hundreds of thousands of people? \"Who's unhappy? Please call us immediately.\" And that's the problem. But I will tell you, people are really happy. What we've done there is incredible. We achieved record funding to restore the awesome might of the American military: $700 billion last year; $716 billion this year; and now, just approved , thank you very much , $738 billion next year. (Applause.) More money, by far, than ever before. And remember, that's all money; it's built in the USA. We build it right here. America, I will tell you, is respected again. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. We have the greatest equipment. We have people with spirit like they haven't had. But we now have the greatest equipment. When I came in two and a half years ago, our equipment was old and tired. Our ammunition was low. Our planes didn't fly well. Many of them didn't fly at all. Now we have beautiful, new planes and jets and fighter jets and bombers. And we have everything. And hopefully we don't have to use them too much, and maybe we don't have to use them at all. But we have the greatest military we've ever had. (Applause.) And, together, so importantly, we ended the last administration's heartless war on American energy. For all of the folks in Texas , we got a lot of you tonight , you're very happy. And plenty of other places. But you're very happy. (Applause.) The United States is now the number one energy producer anywhere in the world, by far. (Applause.) For the first time in more than 60 years , this just happened , we are now a net exporter of American natural gas. (Applause.) And we're ending decades of foreign energy reliance to unleash the blessings of American energy independence. We are really , if you look at what's going on in certain countries in the Middle East, and you look at the Straits, and you see the ships, and they're being taken and they're being , not too often, by the way, because, frankly, Iran is a much different country than it was two and a half years ago. But they were saying, \"We don't see any American ships.\" There are no Amer- , number one, they wouldn't take them. They better not take them. And number two, we don't have too many there. We used to be flooded. We used to get everything there. And now it's a whole different story. We're very energy-independent. We've invested billions of dollars to combat the opioid crisis and those struggling with addiction to find access to treatment, education, and employment. A tremendous problem. We've had tremendous success with opioid. Not that it goes away, but we're looking very strongly for something that can really take away the pain , just take away the pain without being addictive. And we're getting very close. This is a brutal , people go into the hospital for a week, and they come out drug addicts. They come out addicted. It's a terrible thing. But we're working very hard, and we're getting very close, finding a pain killer that's not addictive. For the first time in three decades, drug overdose deaths have declined. Think of that. Over 30 years. (Applause.) First time. Thanks to the entire Republican team in Congress, we passed the biggest tax cut and reform in American history. (Applause.) And we're now working on a middle tax. We're working on a tax cut for the middle-income people. That is going to be very, very inspirational. It's going to be something that I think it's what everyone is really looking for. And we'll be announcing it sometime in the next year. But it'll be a very, very substantial tax cut for middle-income folks who work so hard. And we look forward to that. We're going to work on it all together. And you see what the other tax cut has done. And, frankly, I'm not sure, but I would say that the regulation cuts , those massive cuts in regulation , still have plenty of regulation , but those massive cuts probably equal the tax cuts in terms of jobs and in terms of businesses. The combination of everything really worked because we probably have, right now, the strongest economy in the history of our nation. (Applause.) And where the media is trying to , begging. Oh, they want a recession so badly. Oh. (Laughter.) The word. And every time they go after us, you notice the market goes up? It's the craziest thing. You're going to have to explain this one to me. But we're doing great. We're very close to having another stock market record. It went up again today. And we had , I think it's over 100 records. In other words, days where the stock market hit, in the history of our country , all-time highs. I think it's over 100. I'll get the exact number, but it is really something. And we are very close. And about three weeks ago, if you listened, it was like \"doom and gloom.\" I don't think they believed it, but that's okay. I will tell you, we're doing very well with China, because China would like to do something. We're taking in billions and billions of tariffs. And they're eating the cost. This is not being borne very much by us. They're eating the costs. But we're taking in billions and billions. Money flowing in. We've never taken in 10 cents from China. And they want to do something because their supply lines, their supply chains, are being broken like toys. And people are leaving, and people are , millions of jobs in China are being lost. And we don't want that, but we want a fair deal. We lowered our business tax from one of the highest in the world to one of the most competitive. Since that law was passed, nearly $1 trillion have returned to our shores. One trillion dollars. It was part of what we did. We doubled the child tax credit. (Applause.) Thank you to a number of people for that, but especially Ivanka Trump. That was so important to her to make sure that she understood. (Applause.) Jared is here, but she understood exactly what that meant. She worked so hard on that. We created Opportunity Zones to revitalize distressed communities. Tim Scott was fantastic, and so many other senators. They worked with us so hard on that. But Tim Scott in particular really worked hard. South Carolina. And we thanked him. But they are , they are doing numbers that nobody believed possible, the Opportunity Zones. So much money is going to into areas where it would never seen , see money, and it hasn't seen it in a long time. We eliminated Obamacare's cruel and unpopular individual mandate. (Applause.) Since our election in 2016, we've created more than 6 million new jobs, including over 1 million manufacturing, energy, and construction jobs. Remember when President Obama said, \"No, no, forget the manufacturing; not going to happen\"? Well, we have almost 600,000, just in terms of manufacturing jobs. And nobody thought that was possible. And, frankly, as soon as we get the trade stuff, perfect , just the way we want it; we'll only sign it when it's good, really good. Wait until you see what happens with this economy. We are ready to really rock it even more. We've done very well. You go from Election Night, the day after , take November 9th , and you look at the numbers on stock markets, over 50 percent; 401k(s) are through the roof. People come up to me all the time: \"Thank you, sir. My 401(k) is up 72 percent.\" It's up , whatever it may be. Numbers that they've never had before. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. And this is when we're fighting people on trade, when we have this great military, and we defend countries that are immensely wealthy and they don't help us out, they don't pay us for almost anything. And we're talking to those countries. They're our friends, they're our allies. Sometimes our allies treat us worse than anybody else. But we can't let that happen, and they don't want to let that happen. It just takes a little getting used to, because nobody has ever asked them. \"Look, we're defending your country, you're rich as can be. You got to help us out. You got to pay a little bit.\" And they go, \"No, no.\" I say, \"No, no, no, King. You got to pay.\" \"No, no, Mr. President.\" \"Mr. Prime Minister, you go to pay. You got to pay.\" And the answer is, \"But, uh, nobody has ever asked us to do that before.\" I said, \"That's why I'm different. That's why I'm different. I'm asking you to do it.\" (Applause.) I always say, \"You know, tell me, why are we defending you for free?\" Or \"Why are we defending you for a tiny fraction of what it costs? And then you take advantage of the United States for many years, on trade?\" So we get killed with trade, we get killed with defending your nation. \"Tell me, Mr. President, tell me, Mr. Prime Minister, tell me, King or Queen, why are we protecting your country and you take advantage, really, of us on trade?\" And they go, \"But nobody has ever asked me that question before.\" I said, \"Tell me why.\" They can't think of an answer. The only thing they say all the time , because it has always been that way , I said, \"Well, it's not going to be that way any longer. You got to pay.\" (Applause.) It's true. Not going to be that way any longer. Last month alone, nearly 600,000 people joined our workforce. For the first time ever, most new hires are minorities and women. Nobody knows that because the media doesn't get that across. (Applause.) More than 7 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. And we now have a , 13 straight months of wage gains of at least 3 percent. (Applause.) Think of that. Remember, during the campaign, I used to say that people would go back 21 years , that was when I was running , 21 years. And they made more money 21 years ago than they were making two and a half years ago. They were making more money. And I said, \"Isn't that terrible?\" And they had two jobs and even three jobs, and they made more money 21 years before. Not anymore. African American and Hispanic American unemployment have reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country. (Applause.) I wonder if that will be mentioned tonight during the debate. (Laughter.) I don't know, I have a feeling. What do you think, Steve? I don't think so. Kevin, you think they'll be talking about that? I don't think so. That's a good debate point. As they hit me left and right, I'll say, African American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been. And just leave the stage, and say, \"Thank you very much. Good luck.\" (Laughter and applause.) But another good one is that African American and Hispanic American poverty rates have also reached the all-time, in our history, record lows. I mean, how do you lose this debate? (Applause.) How do you lose the debate? That's a tough one to beat also. Our Pledge to the American Worker has already secured commitments for 13 million employment and training opportunities for American citizens. We have these great companies , greatest companies in the world , and they're training people. Government can't really train them. We're training people through these incredible programs where we're going to these unbelievable , Walmart, as an example, and so many others. We're going to the companies, and they're taking people and training them. We could never train them for that. Nobody can train them for that; only the company itself. Thirteen million people, and it's something beautiful to see. We gather tonight to celebrate these extraordinary gains. We've done things that I don't think any administration has even come close in the first two and a half years. We have done things that very, very few have even thought about doing. But we also meet to prepare for the coming fight, because the traditions and beliefs that have made the American Dream possible are under attack like never before. You've never seen anything like it; I've never seen anything like it. House Democrats are pursuing the most radical far-left program ever put forward in that historic chamber. It's the Democrats and it's the media. We're fighting two battles. The Democrats and the media, it's as if they're one. Because they are one. They're working together. They're colluding. (Laughter.) And they're obstructing. (Applause.) With the grim specter of socialism descending on the Democrat Party, it's up to all of us to ensure the survival of American liberty. We have a big task. We have a very big task. Don't forget, the people say, \"Oh, you're going to beat this one or that one,\" and \"they're so far left.\" It's very hard to beat a socialist when you have a very wealthy country. We have a very wealthy country. And when they say, \"We're going to give away your healthcare. We're going to do free education. We're going to cut student loan debt down to nothing , $1.6 trillion out the window. We're going to do this, we're going to do that.\" Everything is given away. And then they say, \"Oh, we don't have to raise your taxes too much.\" If you paid five times what people are paying right now, you wouldn't come close. And, you know, we're working very hard on a place called Venezuela. Fifteen years ago, it was one of the wealthiest countries in the world. And, today, they don't have food. They don't have water. They don't have anything. They don't have anything. We're sending things to help them , we have to , on a humanitarian basis. And we're working with Colombia and other nations to help the people that have been able to essentially escape. But that was socialism. And look what happened to them in a short period of time. On issue after issue, Americans must choose between two fundamentally different visions that will define our nation for many generations to come. More than 130 Democrats in Congress have signed up for the Bernie Sanders total government takeover of healthcare , (laughter) , Crazy Bernie; he is a crazy guy , which would dramatically raise middle-class taxes, eliminate private health insurance for 180 million Americans, and destroy Medicare forever. Republicans will always protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and they paid for it. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. (Applause.) Two hundred and twenty-eight House Democrats voted to put America back into the disastrous Paris Climate Accord. How's that working out for Paris? How's that one working out for France? The yellow vests. They didn't like all that money being sent to people that they never heard of, the country from which they came. And it hasn't been working out well. But that would have been a disaster for us. It would have cost us a tremendous fortune. They were going to take away our wealth. They were going to say we can't do certain businesses. We can't take the oil and gas. We can't do anything. This would have been one of the great travesties. And you know, incredibly, that and the Clean Waters Act, which didn't give you clean waters. By the way, today, we have the cleanest air, we have the cleanest water that we've ever had in the history of our country. Right, Louie? (Applause.) And just for the press , because they'll get me on that one, I'm thinking , let's say, the history of our country over the last 25 years. You know, I would say that the first few years, they probably had cleaner air and cleaner water because there was nobody here. (Laughter.) So I have to be very accurate. But they'll put it on anyway. They won't put , right, Louie? They won't put the second part on. They won't put the explanation on. But we do. We have clean air; we have clean water. The Paris Accord would do nothing to improve our environment. It would only punish our country while foreign polluters operate with impunity. Isn't it incredible? You look at China, you look at India, you look at Russia, you look at so many other places, their smokestacks are pouring out. Everything is pouring out. And I want to be clean. And we're going to be clean. But isn't it, sort of, na\u00efve? And then they talk about plastic straws. I say, \"What about the plate? What about the wrapper that's made out of a much tougher plastic? What about all the other plastic?\" \"Well, we haven't gotten to that. Just straws. That's the only thing we're worried about.\" Someday, you'll explain that to me, Louie. I'm sure you , you're a big environmentalist. Can you explain the straw? No, I don't think so. Nobody else can either. By the way, you know who else can't? They can't. (Laughter.) They can't explain it. We did a couple of things. We're working on cars because for a virtually just insignificant amount of energy, we're going to be able to produce cars that are substantially , by $3,500 or so , cheaper, less expensive, that are much, much safer , (applause) , because they're heavier, they're stronger. They're not made out of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. (Laughter.) They're heavier, stronger, and they'll cost a lot less money. And you saw that. The lightbulb. People said, \"What's with the lightbulb?\" I said, \"Here's the story \" And I looked at it , the bulb that we're being forced to use , number one, to me, most importantly, the light is no good. I always look orange. (Laughter and applause.) And so do you. The light is the worst. But number two, it's many times more expensive than that old incandescent bulb that worked very well. And very importantly , I don't know if you know this , they have warnings. If it breaks, it's considered a hazardous waste site. It's gasses inside. And read what they say: \"If it breaks, bring it to your local whatever. Have it wrapped, have it this.\" What are we doing? What are we doing? And I said to one of the top people today, \"Well, they break a lot. Don't they?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"What do they do?\" \"They just throw them away. They don't care.\" But they call it \"hazardous waste.\" But it's many times more expensive. And the light is not as good. I mean, frankly, the light is not as good. So, we're going to solve that. But we're also going to solve incandescent bulbs. And people are so happy about it. It's really been pretty amazing. (Applause.) People don't tell you why. All they do is say, \"Oh, he's getting rid of an energy-efficient bulb.\" Well, they don't tell you about the dangers of the bulb, and they don't tell you about the cost of that bulb. Over 100 Democrats have signed up to support the 100- trillion-dollar Green New Deal. (Laughter.) That's a beauty. No more cows. No more planes. I guess, no more people, right? (Laughter.) Because Kevin is just like a cow; he's just smaller. (Laughter.) I had to pick somebody for that one, Kevin, and I just looked at that beautiful, political face of yours, you know? (Laughter.) There's a little truth to that. But this Green New Deal is crazy. Now, they're talking about it tonight. I see hardened Democrat politicians that are , you know, have been smart. And I say, \"It's incredible. They're standing behind AOC\" , I call her \"Cortez,\" because you don't have enough time to go through the whole name. I just call , (laughter) , \"Cortez.\" They don't like that, when you call her Cortez, but her name is Cortez. Too , too long. Or I call her \"AOC.\" Then I call the others \"AOC plus 3.\" (Laughter.) They don't like that. AOC plus 3. That's the definition. But you know, I see her, and I see what's she's talking. She's , she's going through this deal. It's so insane. But I don't want to talk about it. It's too early. I hit Pocahontas way too early. (Laughter.) I thought she was gone. She's emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she could beat Sleepy Joe. He's fallen asleep. He has no idea what the hell he's doing or saying. (Laughter.) And President Xi of China, he is tough. Oh, boy, he's a furious kind of a guy. Great guy, but fur- , he's dying to see , he wants Sleepy Joe. Can you imagine those two guys in a room? Here's Xi: \"Hwah!\" And here's Sleepy Joe, \"What?\" (Laughter.) \"Where am I? Where am I?\" \"Just sign here, Sleepy Joe. Just sign here.\" (Laughter.) \"Like you guys have been doing for the last 25 years. Let us keep taking $500 billion out of your account. Let's keep rebuilding China with America's money.\" That's stopping. A lot of things are stopping that are bad and foolish, crazy. But we won't let Democrats obliterate domestic industry and cripple working-class families with sky-high energy prices. Democrats are proposing to pack the courts with lawless activist judges. We have one. We have many. Look at some of these rulings. But lately, we're doing well. Lately, we're doing well. (Applause.) And today, I signed the 150th judge. (Applause.) Federal judge. Think of it: One hundred and fifty, including court of appeals and two great Supreme Court justices. Think of that. (Applause.) And yesterday, coincidentally, we just won the asylum case. The big one. (Applause.) The big one. And we won it in a vote of 7 to 2. So, that wasn't a very close one, Kevin. Seven to two. And to me , so importantly , because we want to build that wall, we're going to build that wall, and we are building that wall. Because three months ago, we won the case on the wall, so that wall is being built and it's being built rapidly. (Applause.) And we hope to have as much as 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year. Five hundred miles. That's a lot. That's about what we want. (Applause.) And that's being built despite the most obstructive group of people I've ever seen. And, let me tell you, if they want to run their campaign on open borders, and if they want to run their campaign on some of the things they're saying , Green New Deal and all it entails , I just say, let them go. Don't criticize it too much, please. Because one thing I've learned about politics: You can say something one day that's just absolutely insane like they're saying, and then, about two weeks later, say the exact opposite. And nobody will ever even call you on it. It's the craziest business. You're in the craziest business I've ever seen. (Laughter.) It's crazy. You can do whatever you want, and then, two weeks later, they'll say something different. So I want to bring them way down the pike before we start criticizing the Green New Deal. So I just want to say, because we've got a lot of television watching tonight, even though, I guess, they should be watching the debate, but they're probably watching us. (Laughter and applause.) But we have a lot. See those cameras back there. We kept the reporters out. But we have those cameras. See those red bulbs? That means we're on live. But I will tell you this: The Green New Deal , we just want that thing to go as long as it can. Because anybody that can win office, promoting the Green New Deal, they deserve to win. (Laughter.) They got to be really good. They got to have the greatest line of crap anybody has ever had in the history of politics. (Laughter and applause.) Their delivery has to be perfect. Sometimes, unfortunately, delivery is more important than what you say. And theirs has to be. And I've always said about the Democrats, they're lousy politicians, but they have one thing that's incredible: They stick together. And you people have to stick together. And you do. I know you. We have more spirit with our congressmen and women than we've ever had , that, I see. And you're in a small , you're just a little short of taking the majority. And you're going to take it. You're going to take the majority. (Applause.) And Dan , Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy, they'll tell you because they saw what happened. We went into those communities and they went out to vote like nobody has ever seen before. And I'm going to stop at every community that I can. We're going to make a list of 50 or so, and we'll stop there. I got a lot of energy. That's good. If you don't have the energy, you can forget that one. (Applause.) Hillary , she'd make two stops and she'd say, \"I got to rest for a couple of weeks.\" (Laughter.) \"Let me rest for a couple of weeks.\" No, she didn't like stairs. She didn't like airplanes. She didn't like a lot. She said, \"I don't have to go to Wisconsin to campaign.\" Her husband Bill, who is a pro, said, \"You know, I saw what they're doing in Wisconsin. I don't like it. There's a lot of those \"Trump' and \"Trump\/Pence' signs out there. There's a lot of them. I don't like it.\" \"Don't worry about it, darling. Wisconsin is going to be just fine.\" \"The winner of Wisconsin is Donald Trump.\" (Laughter.) \"There's a lot of signs,\" he said. (Applause.) \"In Michigan, there's a lot of signs on the lawns. I was there. There's signs all over the place. You got to go back to Michigan more often.\" \"No, no, no. You don't understand. Michigan hasn't been won for decades by a Republican. My people tell me we're great.\" I don't know who her people were. Now, that's called , if they ever threatened me with that , that I colluded with her people , that I could understand. (Laughter.) That I could , because they told her, \"Don't go back to Michigan, darling. You're okay. Don't go back.\" (Laughter.) \"Donald Trump has won the great state of Michigan.\" (Laughter.) \"Donald Trump has won the great state of Pennsylvania, great state of North Carolina, the great state of Florida, the great state of South Carolina.\" (Applause.) Remember they said we were going to lose Texas? They didn't say that. You know, look, they're crooked as hell. (Laughter.) But they did say , remember? They said, \"Texas is in play.\" (Laughter.) So being somewhat new to the game , like having done it for about three months , I said, \"Let me ask you a question. What does it mean when they say it's in play?\" \"Sir, that means it's too close to call.\" Well, I'm like six or seven months out. They're saying Texas is in play. So I said, \"I don't think so.\" I went to make a speech. We had a line that was miles long. I don't think so. And everybody else was telling me , a great guy got on in Texas, and he's wearing this big cowboy hat, this beautiful hat. I wish we could wear them. Nobody would ever look at my hair and criticize me. (Laughter.) I'd wear that hat and I'd never take it off. Do you ever notice, in Texas, they sit down and have breakfast here , they're wearing the hat. I like that. I would do that. (Laughter.) I don't have to worry about hairspray. I don't have to worry about my hair blowing , (laughter) , beautifully blowing in the wind. (Laughter.) And this guy is on television. A big, strong Texas guy. And they asked him about the race being so close. This is like five months before the election. He said, \"I don't know where you come from, but I come from Texas. And I'll tell you a couple of things, but one of the things I'll tell you for real: This race ain't close at all.\" (Laughter.) \"Trump is going to win by a lot.\" So we get to the evening, and they're saying, \"Texas is in play. It's too close. It's \" The polls close at eight o'clock. Now, unless you have a huge, commanding lead, you know, it's takes an hour, two hours, three hours before they predict, right? Before they say who won. And the polls closed. \"The polls have closed in Texas. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.\" (Laughter and applause.) And for like six months , and then, today, I heard it again. I think , I think it was Buttigieg. (Laughter.) Buttigieg. They said, \"Think of it as \"boot' and then \"edge-edge.'\" Because nobody can pronounce this guy's name. (Laughter.) Nobody. Butt-i-gieg. They say, \"Buttigieg\" , (laughter) , \"and Trump.\" (Laughter.) On what I've done for energy, if anybody beat me in Texas , I don't think anybody can beat me. I don't think Rockefeller can beat me in Texas , the real Rockefeller, the first Rockefeller. I think he'd have a hard time beating me in Texas. But anyway, they said, \"Buttigieg \" (Laughter.) Can you believe this guy? He's doing a rotten job running his own city. Lousy job. But they say, \"Buttigieg is two points up in the state of Texas against President Trump.\" I said, \"I don't think so. I don't think so.\" No, I don't worry about that too much. What do you think, Louie? Who's winning Texas? Think Buttigieg is winning Texas? (Laughter.) I've had him up to here. (Laughter and applause.) Democrats care more about illegal aliens than their own constituents. Republicans know our duty is to represent American citizens. Democrats voted against Kate's Law. How about , what's Kate's Law , how about this? And now, they even threw out the charge about gun possession, which was like the smallest , he got away with murder. He got away , can you imagine? But it's not over yet. It's not over yet. What a horrible thing took place in San Francisco with that incredible, beautiful young woman, holding her father's hand and saying, \"Daddy. Daddy, what happened?\" Can you imagine the shock of it? That's just incredible. And this low-life gets out. Gets out. And people all over the world see that, and they say, \"What the hell is wrong with the United States of America?\" , when they see that. Last year, more than 80 percent of House Democrats refused to support our heroes , ICE. And nearly every House Democrat voted in favor of sanctuary cities, allowing illegal aliens with severe criminal records to terrorize innocent communities. And these two guys were tremendously successful in North Carolina because all we kept doing is saying the governor and all of these Democrats , right, Dan? , all of the Democrats want sanctuary cities. And they let somebody out fairly recently, and that somebody wreaked havoc. Wreaked havoc. I won't even tell you, it was so horrible. But wreaked havoc in a community. Instead of taking him and giving him to ICE , we would have done what you had to do. But I'll tell you, the folks of ICE , at ICE , and Border Patrol and law enforcement, they're not treated properly. And we respect them. Most Americans really respect them. (Applause.) Yeah. (Applause.) You know, we have MS-13 coming in. These are the toughest people you've ever seen, but they're not as tough as ICE. And ICE runs into their nests. You know, they call them a \"nest.\" This is , these are people that don't even like guns because they're not painful enough. They take young women and they slice them up with a knife. They slice them up , beautiful, young , in a case, two 16-year-old young girls walking home from school. They took them and they sliced them up because it was more painful. They killed them. Animals. And then, if you use the term \"animal\" , I mean, look, you know, Nancy Pelosi attacked me because I called them \"animals.\" Remember that? She said, \"They're not animals. They're human beings.\" Well, I don't think so. But ICE will go into a nest. They call it a \"nest\" , where you have a lot of them congregating, up to no good. And ICE will run into that nest like it's , like they're having breakfast with their family on Monday morning. They're tough. And they're patriots, and they love our country. And we're throwing out MS-13 by the thousands. We're throwing them , we're getting them the hell out of our country. (Applause.) And even tough sheriffs say, \"You know, sir, better that they do it.\" And I agree with them. Better that they do it. And the sheriffs agree. But they say, \"Better that they do it.\" And then you have the Democrats. They want to keep them around. And they want to actually take care of them and protect them. And, I don't know, if you tell me that's good politics. And I don't even care about the politics. But it's so bad for our country. But if you tell me you can win with that , with open borders, with no ICE. If you don't have ICE, this country would be overridden. We take out thousands of people , bad people. Really bad people. Public servants make a sacred pledge to defend the nation and its people. Politicians who support sanctuary cities have forsaken this solemn vow. Instead of making a shameful pact to shield and harbor criminal fugitives at any cost , they will do it at any cost. But I'll tell you, people in California , and I see it more and more , they don't want sanctuary cities; it's the politicians that want them. A lot of the people are revolting in different communities. They don't want sanctuary cities. They want to be safe. They can't be safe with sanctuary cities. They're protecting, in many cases, criminals. In July, Montgomery County, Maryland, declared itself a sanctuary city for criminal aliens, forcing local jails to release these dangerous inmates, instead of safely handing them over to ICE. Just hand them over to ICE. Just hand them over to ICE. ICE will take care of the rest. Less than two months later, eight illegal aliens have already been arrested for rape, for sexual assault of a minor. Last month, local officials in Montgomery County released an accused criminal alien rapist back onto the streets, defying ICE's very powerful request to turn him over to them. In March, local officials in Durham County, North Carolina, ignored ICE and released an illegal alien arrested on felony robbery charges. A short time later, that same illegal alien was charged with murder of a 19-year-old woman in Georgia. This is happening, by the way, in over , these are stories I could , I could give you these stories all day long. I love the Angel Moms. I just love those women. I got , women and families , but I got to know a lot of them, what they've suffered and how they've suffered. And they're scorned by the radical Left. They're scorned. Who could scorn a person who lost their daughter put in an ashcan and burned? Stuffed into an ashcan and burned. And they find the person and it's like , who can , who can even , who could endure what they've been through? And it happens a lot. A few stories. It happens a lot. Far worse than what I'm telling you tonight. Far, far worse. Democrats believe our cities should be sanctuaries for violent criminal aliens. Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans. (Applause.) Democrats also believe any illegally alien who merely sets foot on U.S. soil should be automatically released into the interior of the United States and then given free healthcare for life. These craven policies impoverish U.S. communities while enriching human smugglers, traffickers, and vicious criminal cartels. Two hundred and eight House Democrats, nearly 90 percent of the Democrat Caucus, also voted against notifying ICE whenever an illegal alien tries to buy a gun. Meanwhile, Democrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans, so they're totally defenseless when somebody walks into their house with a gun. It's like, \"Whatever you want. Whatever you want. I'm defenseless. Whatever you want.\" How crazy is this? Republicans will forever uphold the fundamental right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) Thank you. The agenda of the Democrat Party is the demolition of the American middle class, because that's what happens. Our Republican agenda is to make our neighborhoods safer, our families stronger, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. And we're on our way to doing it, but we have to win this next election. You know, I said the other day , and I don't know if anyone said it before, but it sounds like it should have been said many times before , but it's like a plant. You grow the plant. You put the plant in, but it hasn't really grabbed on yet. And it won't grab on; it needs a little time. We need a little time. We've done tremendous changes in our country. Tremendous changes. And we're going to do other changes. A lot of really great other changes. But we need that additional time to let it grab on, because they will destroy so much of what we've done, and we can't let that happen. You won't have energy. You won't have business. You won't have jobs. You won't have income. It will be a disaster. So you have to fight like hell. I tell the story of a man who hates me. One of the most successful businesspeople always hated me and I've always hated him. I can't stand that guy. (Laughter.) And I meet him recently and I see him, and he's working with my people on helping us out with fundraisers and everything. I say, \"What are you doing here?\" \"I'm trying to help you get elected.\" I said, \"You got to be kidding me.\" And then, I looked at him and I said, \"But actually, you do have no choice.\" Isn't it true? You don't have a choice. He said, \"No, I really respect what you've done over the last three years\" , almost three years now , \"and I really respect, and it's been great for business, and it's been great for jobs. I have many more people working for me than I had when you became President. And it's really incredible what's happened.\" And for the first time in my entire life, I really like this guy. (Laughter.) Although, he's a tough guy. He's a bad guy. But, no, he's one of many. I go to audiences , I was joking one time recently. I walked up to him; I said, \"Listen, I don't have to make a very long speech. You really have to elect me. Whether you like me or not, it makes no difference, because our country will go to hell. If any of these people get in, it will go to hell. So I'm going to leave now. Goodbye everybody.\" And I joked. And then I came back and I talked. But I said, \"You know, I was joking, but I'm really not joking. You have no choice.\" Because whoever they put in, the saner they are, the worse they're doing. And whoever they put in , and it looks like it's going to be a revolution to the Left , they're going to take your money. They're going to take , and very much hurt your families. I just don't think people can allow that to happen. We have a country that's doing, I think, better than ever before. The economy is the strongest it's ever been. Most powerful, our military , all of the things we've discussed. You have to fight so hard that we win this election. You have to fight so hard. I had a big meeting today on ethanol and the farmers, and it was an incredible meeting. And I sat around, and Chuck Grassley was there and Joni Ernst and John Thune and Mike Pounds [Rounds] and so many , just a whole group of great people. And just sitting around the room. Ben Sasse, who's actually become very good over the last year , we had a little arguments before, but doesn't matter , Ben Sasse was there. We had just a great group of people. And as were sitting in the Oval Office talking about farmers, I realized that all of these people have to make sure that we win because the farmers will be totally put out of business. Many businesses will be put out of business. I just don't even know what they're thinking. What are they doing? What are they doing? And I said to some of the people around the table, strong Republicans, but really people that just love the country. I said, \"You really have to make sure that we win, because if you don't, this country is in such trouble.\" So I used to talk about 2016 as being a very important election, and it was. But in its own way, this is , I'll never say \"of\" , of, you know, \"more important,\" but I can almost say \"of equal importance\" because everything that we've done, everything that we've gained , and the biggest gains are to come because the hard work of getting it approved. You people were involved with so much of it. It was so hard and we got things done. I mean, those tax cuts , all the things we did are so hard. We would have had healthcare done, and we will get it done if we get back the House and if we keep the Senate and keep the presidency, we'll get it done. We would have had healthcare done except for , (applause) , we had one little surprising vote late in the evening. But we would have had it done. We would have had it done, and we'll get it done. If we get back the House, we're going to get it done, as sure as you can be. But even on healthcare, we've done such a good job, and with the individual mandate and all of the other things we've been able to do. We're fighting for everyday citizens who work hard, pay their taxes, raise their children, follow our laws, serve our communities, respect our police, and believe in America with their every ounce, really, of their heart and their soul. We're fighting to protect their jobs, to defend their families, and to ensure their children can live the American Dream. You know, the Republican Party is actually loved in this country. And I think, in a certain way, loved like never before, because we they see that we're fighting for this country. We're fighting for what we grew up with. What , the values that we want. The Republican Party , you know, some people probably take it a little bit for granted, but you really are; you're loved out there. I see it. I see it all the time. Whenever I went , I saw it in North Carolina the other day. I'm backstage waiting to go on, and so many people have come up to me and they say, \"Sir, thank you for saving our nation.\" Well, you're equal to me. What you , what you've done is incredible. Some of the things that you've done in a short period of time is pretty damn incredible. (Applause.) A nation's first duty is to care for its own citizens, and that is why we're working to give the American people a high-quality, low-cost , and this is what's going to happen , we want a low-cost healthcare system with more transparency and more choice. You know, we're doing transparency. I think you've all seen that. And a man came in who's an expert , he's a tremendous, tremendous man who I have a lot of respect for , and he said, \"Transparency.\" I said, \"Explain transparency.\" Sounds very simple. And I got it done. This is where people can go to hospitals and price, and they can pick their doctor. He said, \"Sir, this is bigger than any healthcare you can do. You watch.\" And it will be put into effect , Secretary Azar, who's doing an incredible job , it will be put into effect fairly soon. We signed it about four months ago. It's being worked out. People are able to go in and negotiate the prices. You know, you have these horror stories where a woman will cut her hand and go into a hospital. You don't ask how much. But they'll go into a hospital and have the hand, and then they'll get billed $5,000. And they don't have $5,000. The horror stories are unbelievable. And we went through it. And some of you were in the room when I did signings. But we're having transparency, where you can have lists of prices. When you have some problem, they list it. You can go and negotiate prices. You can go to the drug store and say, \"Well, we want to see, how much is that? How much \" You know, right now you can't even do that. They don't let you do that. But now we do. And we've opened that up too. We've done a lot. Right to Try is something we've done a great job , you people have. (Applause.) You have to see the results on Right to Try. But a person can be terminally ill in the old system, and we could have a drug that we know works but is still going to take another year or two of testing, and we tell the person, \"I'm sorry, we can't let you use that drug because it may hurt you.\" Well, you're going to die within three weeks or four weeks. You're terminally ill. They've wanted to do this for 45 years. And it's not as easy as all that. The country was worried that they'll sue the country. The doctors were worried they'd sue the doctors through the insurance companies, sue the pharmaceutical companies. I got everybody into a room. I said, \"Listen, what we do is we sign an agreement where we guarantee \" , and a tough agreement , \" where you guarantee that we have no liability, the doctor has no liability, the pharmaceutical company has no liability, and various other things.\" I said, \"And everybody's happy.\" Then they said, \"Well, we don't want them on the list.\" If a person is terminally ill, the pharmaceutical companies , I understood that. \"We don't want them on our list.\" Because they do a list of success. \"And when a person is very, very sick , maybe toward the end of their life, terminally ill , we don't want that person on our list as a sample, as a test sample.\" I said, \"I understand that. So we're not going to have that person on your list. When you do this, we're not going to have that person on your list. We create a separate list of very, very sick, terminally ill people. But for your list, we're not going to put it.\" They said, \"Wow, we like that.\" And we got it signed. And you have to see the success. People used to go to Asia. They'd go to Europe. They'd go all over the world looking, if they had money. Most people didn't have the money, so they'd go home and they'd die. Now they have the Right to Try. And I congratulate you on that because you were the ones that really did a job. (Applause.) And Greg was great , wherever Greg may be. Is Greg here? Greg? Where's Greg? Oh, boy, you stood up fast. That's good. (Applause.) Thank you, Greg. I'd call Greg and I'd say, \"Man, you've got to get it done.\" And it wasn't easy like people would've thought. Do you agree with that? That was not easy. We had more people coming at us , thank you very much, Greg. It was a fantastic job. And a lot of other folks in the room. That's why we're ending years of economic surrender and we're confronting China's chronic trading abuses. For years, past leaders let China freely loot our economy, racking up trillions and trillions of dollars in costly trade deficits. Now, the world is on notice that people aren't going to be able to do that to the United States anymore. They're not doing it anymore, and they know it. They know it. They get it. They come to me and they see me , the leaders. I know them all now, pretty much. Some I have great respect for. Some I don't get along with as well. You know, there was a poll recently that Obama is much more popular in Germany than I am. I said, \"Of course he is.\" He's not saying to Germany, \"You've got to pay us for the military.\" He's not saying to Germany, \"Why are you paying billions and billions of dollars to Russia for a pipeline coming in?\" And then we defend , how about that one? We pay billions of dollars to Russia and then we defend Germany from Russia. Figure , does that work, right? (Laughter.) Does that work? Give Russia billions and then we defend you. Oh, that's a wonderful deal. We've got plenty of those deals. That's one of the better ones. With your help, we will also achieve a historic victory for the American farmer, rancher, and workers by replacing the horrible disaster , to me, one of the worst deals ever , NAFTA. And we're replacing it with the USMCA, which really is incredible. (Applause.) Got to get it up for a vote. They've got to put it up for a vote. By the way, the Democrats are going to vote for it. Unions love it. Farmers love it. I would say unions like it. But they like it. They hate NAFTA. It's their all-time least. Manufacturers love it. The farmers are desperate for it; it's so important. And let it be bipartisan. I told Nancy Pelosi. \"Nancy, put it up for a vote. It's going to bipartisan. You can have all the credit you want. You have to do something other than try and impeach somebody that didn't do anything wrong. You have to.\" (Laughter.) I said, \"It's hard to impeach somebody who didn't do anything wrong.\" The Mueller report is out. There's no collusion, after two and a half years. Think of it. How ridiculous: I collude with Russia. In fact, Russia said, \"You know, if we really did pick him, we made a real bad choice.\" (Laughter.) Think of it. Even tonight, I'm talking about we have the strongest military. We're spending billions and billions. We're the strongest military, right? We have the strongest energy. Hillary wanted windmills. She wanted solar. Solar is fine , you know, small potatoes, compared to what we're talking about. It doesn't have the power that you need. And someday, good. I love solar. I think solar is good, but it's limited. The wind is very expensive because you put up those windmills , I know it very well. First of all, they're made in Germany and they're made in China. Think of the pollutants that go on the air when they're making these massive steel things. If it's anywhere near your house, your house is way down in value. Try dropping a windmill someplace close to your house. Try selling your house. They make noise. They kill all the birds. The energy is intermittent. If you happen to be watching the Democrat debate and the wind isn't blowing, you're not going to the see the debate. \"Charlie, what the hell happened to this debate?\" (Laughter.) He says, \"Darling, the wind isn't blowing. The goddamn windmill stopped. That windmill stopped.\" (Laughter.) Republicans know that American families are the true backbone of America. That is why I was the first President to propose nationwide paid family leave in my budget. Very important. (Applause.) Women want it. Our goal is to ensure that every American family enjoys an amazing quality of life. Together, we are going to fix our housing finance system. We're working on that very hard , to protect the dream of ownership for the next generation. We're going to make new cars more affordable and much safer. My administration will soon issue standards that will save families thousands and thousands, as I've said, of dollars per car. We're going to fight for the future of cities like Baltimore that have been destroyed by decades of failed and corrupt rule. (Applause.) The left-wing agenda of total government domination, crushing regulation, crippling taxes, unrestricted migration, and un- , and I mean, think of this , it's undermining all law enforcement. They undermine law enforcement and they devastate America's inner cities. They've been devastated. And even the cities like Los Angeles , look at what's happening. It's like , look at what's happening. San Francisco. Take a look at what's going on. And we're going to have to step in and do something about it because we can't allow that to happen to our great cities. Los Angeles is a great city. (Applause.) We can't allow it. And in the not-too-distant future, you're going to see. We're going to step in. We're not going to allow it to happen, where major, major companies are leaving their cities. They're leaving our country when they see that. You walk in. They pay a lot of rent. They walk into a beautiful building , the best street in California. And you have a site that nobody even can believe. Nobody can believe. And we're going to have to do something about it. And we will do something about it. We're going to give them notice. In fact, we gave them a notice a today: Clean it up. You got to do something. You can't have it. These are our great American cities and they're an embarrassment, what the Democrats have let happen. Republicans want to rebuild our inner cities and provide a future of limitless opportunity for all Americans. And Republicans believe that parents should have the right to send their kids to the school of their choice. (Applause.) So, just in concluding, in everything we do, Republicans are fighting for the values that bring us together as one nation, under God. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand up for the heroes of law enforcement. We reject globalism and we embrace patriotism. We believe that there is no treasure on Earth more valuable than our American citizenship. (Applause.) We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, cherish our heroes, and always respect our great American flag. (Applause.) These are the values that unite us tonight. These are the values that bind our country. These are the values the American people share, deep in their souls. And these are the values that Republicans will champion all across the land. And that's what's happening. And that's why people love what you're doing. That's why people are loving the Republican Party again. (Applause.) Our task is to be confident in these truths, certain of this vision, bold in our actions, and forever loyal to the citizens we serve. If we stay true to our mission , and we have to, and we have to stick together like they do. They've got nothing else on us, but, like I said, they stick together. If we remain firm in our convictions, if we always put America first, then there will be no limit to the progress that we will make, no bounds to the good that we will do, no ceiling on the heights that we will reach, and no end to the victories we will achieve. We will win, win, win. And we will keep on winning. You know, I tell that story and some people love it, and probably some don't, but I think they all love it. I'm going to win a place like , here we go. I'm going to use Dan as an example. I'm in North Carolina, and I'm going to say, \"We're going to win again. We're going to win so much.\" Right, Dan? We're going to so much. We're going to win, win, win. (Applause.) And our country , you go back and we haven't been doing so much winning with trade and with all of these different things. And I'm going to go , I'm going to go to Dan Bishop, and I'm going to say, \"Dan, we're going to win.\" And they're going to come in to see Dan. They're going to say, \"Please, please, stop the President from winning. We're winning so much. Dan, go visit. You're our new congressman. Go to the Oval Office. He respects you because, unlike these other people, he doesn't know you so well. So you are still respected.\" (Laughter.) \"And please, see the President and talk to the President. Tell him to stop winning so much. We don't want to win so much in the great state of North Carolina.\" And I'm going to say, \"Dan, I'm sorry. I'm not doing that. We're going to keep winning, winning, winning.\" Right, Dan? We're going to keep winning, winning, winning. (Applause.) Congratulations. After all we've achieved and after everything that we've accomplished, our message is simple: The best is yet to come. (Applause.) The best is yet to come. Together, we will make America stronger, and safer, and prouder, and greater than ever before. And I want to thank everybody for being tonight. You are a terrific group and I know almost all of you. I like most of you. I know all of you. (Laughter.) No, you are. You're a terrific group, and I think we're going to have a terrific, long time together. And Kevin, and everybody, I want to thank you. This was an incredible evening. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1370195\/remarks-by-president-trump-at-the-2019-house-republican-conference-member-retreat-dinner-baltimore-md&speechType=1","Summary":"Employment and Affirmative Action Executive Branch Health Insurance Health and Health Care Drugs Energy Environment","Source":null,"Location":"Baltimore, MD","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-2019-house-republican-conference-member-retreat-dinner-baltimore-md\/","CleanText":"Thank you, everybody. (Applause.) That's a group. Some group. Thank you very much. Thank you. That's fantastic. A lot of power in this room. Wow. A lot of power. Thank you, Kevin, for your friendship and for your devotion to our nation. I'm delighted to be here with so many terrific Republican members of Congress. You really are terrific people. I especially want to thank our amazing leadership team: Republican Whip, and one of the bravest men I know, Steve Scalise. Steve, thank you very much. (Applause.) Conference Chair Liz Cheney. (Applause.) Thank you, Liz. NRCC Chair Tom Emmer. Tom. (Applause.) Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Tom. And Chief Deputy Whip Drew Ferguson. Great job. (Applause.) Thank you, Drew. Great job. I also want to proudly welcome our newest Republican congressmen , two people that fought a big fight for the last number of months, and they're winners. They reacted so incredibly under pressure. The whole world was watching. A lot of people were hoping for the opposite outcome, but many more people were hoping for the outcome that we had. A man who wasn't expected necessarily to win, and then he got in gear and he was brutal and brilliant, and he did a great job. Now, soon to be, and now Congressman Dan Bishop , for many years. Thank you, Dan. (Applause.) Dan, thank you. What a great job. (Applause.) What a great job, Dan. And another man who fought so hard and he was supposed to win by a little tiny bit, a couple of points, and he won by a lot of points. That was a big victory, and I want to just congratulate you. Greg Murphy is going to be with you folks for a long time. (Applause.) These two people are special people. North Carolina , thank you, North Carolina. (Applause.) They were some crowds that turned out. They turned out, and they turned out like people never expected. And they were , that was just a great evening of television. I wouldn't say the fake news was too happy with the outcome, but that's okay. That's okay. We did it. And we worked together as a team, and it was very inspirational for a lot of people to watch. Everyone here tonight has a critical role to play at the vital crossroads of our nation. Democrats in Congress have embraced an extreme, destructive, and dangerous agenda: radical socialism and open borders. Democrats are determined to replicate the most catastrophic failures of world history right here in the United States. They've never learned. They haven't watched. Each of you in the House Republican Conference is on the frontlines defending American freedom, American security, American prosperity, and the American way of life. You're the ones , you're doing the defense. Hundreds of millions of our fellow citizens are counting on us, and, so help us God, we will never, ever let them down. (Applause.) Together, we're going to fight historic battles, and we have historic battles ahead of us. Going to make our country even greater. And we're going to win overwhelming victories for the American people. The spirit that we have in the Republican Party, I don't believe, has ever been this high. Over the past two and a half years, we've already delivered unprecedented progress for citizens of every background and every walk of life. Now we must go directly to the American people to share the story of what we have achieved and to explain our bold vision for the future. Working with Republicans in Congress, we slashed 30,000 pages of regulations from the Federal Register. (Applause.) And that is an all-time record, and we did that in a lot less years. That's an all-time record, no matter how long a President was there. We saved an average American household $3,000. Earlier today, my administration formally repealed the horrible, dangerous, anti-everything Waters of the United States rule. (Applause.) Thank you, Louie. Thank you, Louie. I would say the only thing that had going for it that was good was the title. (Laughter.) That was , I said, 'I'm the only one that would sign this.' But it was a good thing we did. Right, Louie? It was a good thing we did. Government will no longer try to micromanage every rain puddle and every drainage ditch on private land. They took your land away from you. Together, we enacted the VA Accountability Act, so that anyone who mistreats or abuses our great veterans can be promptly fired. (Applause.) There was a time you couldn't fire anyone, no matter how they treated our veterans, whether they stole or they were sadists. And we had some of them too. You couldn't fire them, and now we can do it very, very quickly and easily. They don't treat our veterans well. We get them out. Since then, we've removed more than 7,600 employees who failed to give our vets the care they so richly deserve. We're also very proud to tell you that the Veterans Choice, which is something special , so special; they've been trying to get it for decades and decades , Choice , so that more veterans have the right to see a private doctor, if they have to wait on line, instead of waiting for two weeks or three weeks or five weeks, or numbers that you wouldn't even believe. Think of it. You're sick, you're not feeling well, and they tell you, 'Come back in four weeks.' Now you go outside, you go to a local doctor of your choice, by the way , unlike somebody else, where they said, 'You can have your doctor and you can have your plan' 28 times. That didn't work out too well. (Laughter.) You go out and you see a doctor of your choice. We pay the bill. And it's been an incredible thing. I'll tell you, what's happening at the VA has been really something special. If you look and , you just see it. All you used to see and read about is how bad the VA was run, how horrible it was. And you don't hear those stories anymore. Now, you know, what we'll go is these people will run out and they'll start trying to find somebody. 'Who is unhappy?' Thousands and hundreds of thousands of people? 'Who's unhappy? Please call us immediately.' And that's the problem. But I will tell you, people are really happy. What we've done there is incredible. We achieved record funding to restore the awesome might of the American military: $700 billion last year; $716 billion this year; and now, just approved , thank you very much , $738 billion next year. (Applause.) More money, by far, than ever before. And remember, that's all money; it's built in the USA. We build it right here. America, I will tell you, is respected again. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. We have the greatest equipment. We have people with spirit like they haven't had. But we now have the greatest equipment. When I came in two and a half years ago, our equipment was old and tired. Our ammunition was low. Our planes didn't fly well. Many of them didn't fly at all. Now we have beautiful, new planes and jets and fighter jets and bombers. And we have everything. And hopefully we don't have to use them too much, and maybe we don't have to use them at all. But we have the greatest military we've ever had. (Applause.) And, together, so importantly, we ended the last administration's heartless war on American energy. For all of the folks in Texas , we got a lot of you tonight , you're very happy. And plenty of other places. But you're very happy. (Applause.) The United States is now the number one energy producer anywhere in the world, by far. (Applause.) For the first time in more than 60 years , this just happened , we are now a net exporter of American natural gas. (Applause.) And we're ending decades of foreign energy reliance to unleash the blessings of American energy independence. We are really , if you look at what's going on in certain countries in the Middle East, and you look at the Straits, and you see the ships, and they're being taken and they're being , not too often, by the way, because, frankly, Iran is a much different country than it was two and a half years ago. But they were saying, 'We don't see any American ships.' There are no Amer- , number one, they wouldn't take them. They better not take them. And number two, we don't have too many there. We used to be flooded. We used to get everything there. And now it's a whole different story. We're very energy-independent. We've invested billions of dollars to combat the opioid crisis and those struggling with addiction to find access to treatment, education, and employment. A tremendous problem. We've had tremendous success with opioid. Not that it goes away, but we're looking very strongly for something that can really take away the pain , just take away the pain without being addictive. And we're getting very close. This is a brutal , people go into the hospital for a week, and they come out drug addicts. They come out addicted. It's a terrible thing. But we're working very hard, and we're getting very close, finding a pain killer that's not addictive. For the first time in three decades, drug overdose deaths have declined. Think of that. Over 30 years. (Applause.) First time. Thanks to the entire Republican team in Congress, we passed the biggest tax cut and reform in American history. (Applause.) And we're now working on a middle tax. We're working on a tax cut for the middle-income people. That is going to be very, very inspirational. It's going to be something that I think it's what everyone is really looking for. And we'll be announcing it sometime in the next year. But it'll be a very, very substantial tax cut for middle-income folks who work so hard. And we look forward to that. We're going to work on it all together. And you see what the other tax cut has done. And, frankly, I'm not sure, but I would say that the regulation cuts , those massive cuts in regulation , still have plenty of regulation , but those massive cuts probably equal the tax cuts in terms of jobs and in terms of businesses. The combination of everything really worked because we probably have, right now, the strongest economy in the history of our nation. (Applause.) And where the media is trying to , begging. Oh, they want a recession so badly. Oh. (Laughter.) The word. And every time they go after us, you notice the market goes up? It's the craziest thing. You're going to have to explain this one to me. But we're doing great. We're very close to having another stock market record. It went up again today. And we had , I think it's over 100 records. In other words, days where the stock market hit, in the history of our country , all-time highs. I think it's over 100. I'll get the exact number, but it is really something. And we are very close. And about three weeks ago, if you listened, it was like 'doom and gloom.' I don't think they believed it, but that's okay. I will tell you, we're doing very well with China, because China would like to do something. We're taking in billions and billions of tariffs. And they're eating the cost. This is not being borne very much by us. They're eating the costs. But we're taking in billions and billions. Money flowing in. We've never taken in 10 cents from China. And they want to do something because their supply lines, their supply chains, are being broken like toys. And people are leaving, and people are , millions of jobs in China are being lost. And we don't want that, but we want a fair deal. We lowered our business tax from one of the highest in the world to one of the most competitive. Since that law was passed, nearly $1 trillion have returned to our shores. One trillion dollars. It was part of what we did. We doubled the child tax credit. (Applause.) Thank you to a number of people for that, but especially Ivanka Trump. That was so important to her to make sure that she understood. (Applause.) Jared is here, but she understood exactly what that meant. She worked so hard on that. We created Opportunity Zones to revitalize distressed communities. Tim Scott was fantastic, and so many other senators. They worked with us so hard on that. But Tim Scott in particular really worked hard. South Carolina. And we thanked him. But they are , they are doing numbers that nobody believed possible, the Opportunity Zones. So much money is going to into areas where it would never seen , see money, and it hasn't seen it in a long time. We eliminated Obamacare's cruel and unpopular individual mandate. (Applause.) Since our election in 2016, we've created more than 6 million new jobs, including over 1 million manufacturing, energy, and construction jobs. Remember when President Obama said, 'No, no, forget the manufacturing; not going to happen'? Well, we have almost 600,000, just in terms of manufacturing jobs. And nobody thought that was possible. And, frankly, as soon as we get the trade stuff, perfect , just the way we want it; we'll only sign it when it's good, really good. Wait until you see what happens with this economy. We are ready to really rock it even more. We've done very well. You go from Election Night, the day after , take November 9th , and you look at the numbers on stock markets, over 50 percent; 401k(s) are through the roof. People come up to me all the time: 'Thank you, sir. My 401(k) is up 72 percent.' It's up , whatever it may be. Numbers that they've never had before. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. And this is when we're fighting people on trade, when we have this great military, and we defend countries that are immensely wealthy and they don't help us out, they don't pay us for almost anything. And we're talking to those countries. They're our friends, they're our allies. Sometimes our allies treat us worse than anybody else. But we can't let that happen, and they don't want to let that happen. It just takes a little getting used to, because nobody has ever asked them. 'Look, we're defending your country, you're rich as can be. You got to help us out. You got to pay a little bit.' And they go, 'No, no.' I say, 'No, no, no, King. You got to pay.' 'No, no, Mr. President.' 'Mr. Prime Minister, you go to pay. You got to pay.' And the answer is, 'But, uh, nobody has ever asked us to do that before.' I said, 'That's why I'm different. That's why I'm different. I'm asking you to do it.' (Applause.) I always say, 'You know, tell me, why are we defending you for free?' Or 'Why are we defending you for a tiny fraction of what it costs? And then you take advantage of the United States for many years, on trade?' So we get killed with trade, we get killed with defending your nation. 'Tell me, Mr. President, tell me, Mr. Prime Minister, tell me, King or Queen, why are we protecting your country and you take advantage, really, of us on trade?' And they go, 'But nobody has ever asked me that question before.' I said, 'Tell me why.' They can't think of an answer. The only thing they say all the time , because it has always been that way , I said, 'Well, it's not going to be that way any longer. You got to pay.' (Applause.) It's true. Not going to be that way any longer. Last month alone, nearly 600,000 people joined our workforce. For the first time ever, most new hires are minorities and women. Nobody knows that because the media doesn't get that across. (Applause.) More than 7 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. And we now have a , 13 straight months of wage gains of at least 3 percent. (Applause.) Think of that. Remember, during the campaign, I used to say that people would go back 21 years , that was when I was running , 21 years. And they made more money 21 years ago than they were making two and a half years ago. They were making more money. And I said, 'Isn't that terrible?' And they had two jobs and even three jobs, and they made more money 21 years before. Not anymore. African American and Hispanic American unemployment have reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country. (Applause.) I wonder if that will be mentioned tonight during the debate. (Laughter.) I don't know, I have a feeling. What do you think, Steve? I don't think so. Kevin, you think they'll be talking about that? I don't think so. That's a good debate point. As they hit me left and right, I'll say, African American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been. And just leave the stage, and say, 'Thank you very much. Good luck.' (Laughter and applause.) But another good one is that African American and Hispanic American poverty rates have also reached the all-time, in our history, record lows. I mean, how do you lose this debate? (Applause.) How do you lose the debate? That's a tough one to beat also. Our Pledge to the American Worker has already secured commitments for 13 million employment and training opportunities for American citizens. We have these great companies , greatest companies in the world , and they're training people. Government can't really train them. We're training people through these incredible programs where we're going to these unbelievable , Walmart, as an example, and so many others. We're going to the companies, and they're taking people and training them. We could never train them for that. Nobody can train them for that; only the company itself. Thirteen million people, and it's something beautiful to see. We gather tonight to celebrate these extraordinary gains. We've done things that I don't think any administration has even come close in the first two and a half years. We have done things that very, very few have even thought about doing. But we also meet to prepare for the coming fight, because the traditions and beliefs that have made the American Dream possible are under attack like never before. You've never seen anything like it; I've never seen anything like it. House Democrats are pursuing the most radical far-left program ever put forward in that historic chamber. It's the Democrats and it's the media. We're fighting two battles. The Democrats and the media, it's as if they're one. Because they are one. They're working together. They're colluding. (Laughter.) And they're obstructing. (Applause.) With the grim specter of socialism descending on the Democrat Party, it's up to all of us to ensure the survival of American liberty. We have a big task. We have a very big task. Don't forget, the people say, 'Oh, you're going to beat this one or that one,' and 'they're so far left.' It's very hard to beat a socialist when you have a very wealthy country. We have a very wealthy country. And when they say, 'We're going to give away your healthcare. We're going to do free education. We're going to cut student loan debt down to nothing , $1.6 trillion out the window. We're going to do this, we're going to do that.' Everything is given away. And then they say, 'Oh, we don't have to raise your taxes too much.' If you paid five times what people are paying right now, you wouldn't come close. And, you know, we're working very hard on a place called Venezuela. Fifteen years ago, it was one of the wealthiest countries in the world. And, today, they don't have food. They don't have water. They don't have anything. They don't have anything. We're sending things to help them , we have to , on a humanitarian basis. And we're working with Colombia and other nations to help the people that have been able to essentially escape. But that was socialism. And look what happened to them in a short period of time. On issue after issue, Americans must choose between two fundamentally different visions that will define our nation for many generations to come. More than 130 Democrats in Congress have signed up for the Bernie Sanders total government takeover of healthcare , (laughter) , Crazy Bernie; he is a crazy guy , which would dramatically raise middle-class taxes, eliminate private health insurance for 180 million Americans, and destroy Medicare forever. Republicans will always protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and they paid for it. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. (Applause.) Two hundred and twenty-eight House Democrats voted to put America back into the disastrous Paris Climate Accord. How's that working out for Paris? How's that one working out for France? The yellow vests. They didn't like all that money being sent to people that they never heard of, the country from which they came. And it hasn't been working out well. But that would have been a disaster for us. It would have cost us a tremendous fortune. They were going to take away our wealth. They were going to say we can't do certain businesses. We can't take the oil and gas. We can't do anything. This would have been one of the great travesties. And you know, incredibly, that and the Clean Waters Act, which didn't give you clean waters. By the way, today, we have the cleanest air, we have the cleanest water that we've ever had in the history of our country. Right, Louie? (Applause.) And just for the press , because they'll get me on that one, I'm thinking , let's say, the history of our country over the last 25 years. You know, I would say that the first few years, they probably had cleaner air and cleaner water because there was nobody here. (Laughter.) So I have to be very accurate. But they'll put it on anyway. They won't put , right, Louie? They won't put the second part on. They won't put the explanation on. But we do. We have clean air; we have clean water. The Paris Accord would do nothing to improve our environment. It would only punish our country while foreign polluters operate with impunity. Isn't it incredible? You look at China, you look at India, you look at Russia, you look at so many other places, their smokestacks are pouring out. Everything is pouring out. And I want to be clean. And we're going to be clean. But isn't it, sort of, na\ufffdve? And then they talk about plastic straws. I say, 'What about the plate? What about the wrapper that's made out of a much tougher plastic? What about all the other plastic?' 'Well, we haven't gotten to that. Just straws. That's the only thing we're worried about.' Someday, you'll explain that to me, Louie. I'm sure you , you're a big environmentalist. Can you explain the straw? No, I don't think so. Nobody else can either. By the way, you know who else can't? They can't. (Laughter.) They can't explain it. We did a couple of things. We're working on cars because for a virtually just insignificant amount of energy, we're going to be able to produce cars that are substantially , by $3,500 or so , cheaper, less expensive, that are much, much safer , (applause) , because they're heavier, they're stronger. They're not made out of papier-m\ufffdch\ufffd. (Laughter.) They're heavier, stronger, and they'll cost a lot less money. And you saw that. The lightbulb. People said, 'What's with the lightbulb?' I said, 'Here's the story ' And I looked at it , the bulb that we're being forced to use , number one, to me, most importantly, the light is no good. I always look orange. (Laughter and applause.) And so do you. The light is the worst. But number two, it's many times more expensive than that old incandescent bulb that worked very well. And very importantly , I don't know if you know this , they have warnings. If it breaks, it's considered a hazardous waste site. It's gasses inside. And read what they say: 'If it breaks, bring it to your local whatever. Have it wrapped, have it this.' What are we doing? What are we doing? And I said to one of the top people today, 'Well, they break a lot. Don't they?' 'Yes, sir.' 'What do they do?' 'They just throw them away. They don't care.' But they call it 'hazardous waste.' But it's many times more expensive. And the light is not as good. I mean, frankly, the light is not as good. So, we're going to solve that. But we're also going to solve incandescent bulbs. And people are so happy about it. It's really been pretty amazing. (Applause.) People don't tell you why. All they do is say, 'Oh, he's getting rid of an energy-efficient bulb.' Well, they don't tell you about the dangers of the bulb, and they don't tell you about the cost of that bulb. Over 100 Democrats have signed up to support the 100- trillion-dollar Green New Deal. (Laughter.) That's a beauty. No more cows. No more planes. I guess, no more people, right? (Laughter.) Because Kevin is just like a cow; he's just smaller. (Laughter.) I had to pick somebody for that one, Kevin, and I just looked at that beautiful, political face of yours, you know? (Laughter.) There's a little truth to that. But this Green New Deal is crazy. Now, they're talking about it tonight. I see hardened Democrat politicians that are , you know, have been smart. And I say, 'It's incredible. They're standing behind AOC' , I call her 'Cortez,' because you don't have enough time to go through the whole name. I just call , (laughter) , 'Cortez.' They don't like that, when you call her Cortez, but her name is Cortez. Too , too long. Or I call her 'AOC.' Then I call the others 'AOC plus 3.' (Laughter.) They don't like that. AOC plus 3. That's the definition. But you know, I see her, and I see what's she's talking. She's , she's going through this deal. It's so insane. But I don't want to talk about it. It's too early. I hit Pocahontas way too early. (Laughter.) I thought she was gone. She's emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she could beat Sleepy Joe. He's fallen asleep. He has no idea what the hell he's doing or saying. (Laughter.) And President Xi of China, he is tough. Oh, boy, he's a furious kind of a guy. Great guy, but fur- , he's dying to see , he wants Sleepy Joe. Can you imagine those two guys in a room? Here's Xi: 'Hwah!' And here's Sleepy Joe, 'What?' (Laughter.) 'Where am I? Where am I?' 'Just sign here, Sleepy Joe. Just sign here.' (Laughter.) 'Like you guys have been doing for the last 25 years. Let us keep taking $500 billion out of your account. Let's keep rebuilding China with America's money.' That's stopping. A lot of things are stopping that are bad and foolish, crazy. But we won't let Democrats obliterate domestic industry and cripple working-class families with sky-high energy prices. Democrats are proposing to pack the courts with lawless activist judges. We have one. We have many. Look at some of these rulings. But lately, we're doing well. Lately, we're doing well. (Applause.) And today, I signed the 150th judge. (Applause.) Federal judge. Think of it: One hundred and fifty, including court of appeals and two great Supreme Court justices. Think of that. (Applause.) And yesterday, coincidentally, we just won the asylum case. The big one. (Applause.) The big one. And we won it in a vote of 7 to 2. So, that wasn't a very close one, Kevin. Seven to two. And to me , so importantly , because we want to build that wall, we're going to build that wall, and we are building that wall. Because three months ago, we won the case on the wall, so that wall is being built and it's being built rapidly. (Applause.) And we hope to have as much as 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year. Five hundred miles. That's a lot. That's about what we want. (Applause.) And that's being built despite the most obstructive group of people I've ever seen. And, let me tell you, if they want to run their campaign on open borders, and if they want to run their campaign on some of the things they're saying , Green New Deal and all it entails , I just say, let them go. Don't criticize it too much, please. Because one thing I've learned about politics: You can say something one day that's just absolutely insane like they're saying, and then, about two weeks later, say the exact opposite. And nobody will ever even call you on it. It's the craziest business. You're in the craziest business I've ever seen. (Laughter.) It's crazy. You can do whatever you want, and then, two weeks later, they'll say something different. So I want to bring them way down the pike before we start criticizing the Green New Deal. So I just want to say, because we've got a lot of television watching tonight, even though, I guess, they should be watching the debate, but they're probably watching us. (Laughter and applause.) But we have a lot. See those cameras back there. We kept the reporters out. But we have those cameras. See those red bulbs? That means we're on live. But I will tell you this: The Green New Deal , we just want that thing to go as long as it can. Because anybody that can win office, promoting the Green New Deal, they deserve to win. (Laughter.) They got to be really good. They got to have the greatest line of crap anybody has ever had in the history of politics. (Laughter and applause.) Their delivery has to be perfect. Sometimes, unfortunately, delivery is more important than what you say. And theirs has to be. And I've always said about the Democrats, they're lousy politicians, but they have one thing that's incredible: They stick together. And you people have to stick together. And you do. I know you. We have more spirit with our congressmen and women than we've ever had , that, I see. And you're in a small , you're just a little short of taking the majority. And you're going to take it. You're going to take the majority. (Applause.) And Dan , Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy, they'll tell you because they saw what happened. We went into those communities and they went out to vote like nobody has ever seen before. And I'm going to stop at every community that I can. We're going to make a list of 50 or so, and we'll stop there. I got a lot of energy. That's good. If you don't have the energy, you can forget that one. (Applause.) Hillary , she'd make two stops and she'd say, 'I got to rest for a couple of weeks.' (Laughter.) 'Let me rest for a couple of weeks.' No, she didn't like stairs. She didn't like airplanes. She didn't like a lot. She said, 'I don't have to go to Wisconsin to campaign.' Her husband Bill, who is a pro, said, 'You know, I saw what they're doing in Wisconsin. I don't like it. There's a lot of those 'Trump' and 'Trump\/Pence' signs out there. There's a lot of them. I don't like it.' 'Don't worry about it, darling. Wisconsin is going to be just fine.' 'The winner of Wisconsin is Donald Trump.' (Laughter.) 'There's a lot of signs,' he said. (Applause.) 'In Michigan, there's a lot of signs on the lawns. I was there. There's signs all over the place. You got to go back to Michigan more often.' 'No, no, no. You don't understand. Michigan hasn't been won for decades by a Republican. My people tell me we're great.' I don't know who her people were. Now, that's called , if they ever threatened me with that , that I colluded with her people , that I could understand. (Laughter.) That I could , because they told her, 'Don't go back to Michigan, darling. You're okay. Don't go back.' (Laughter.) 'Donald Trump has won the great state of Michigan.' (Laughter.) 'Donald Trump has won the great state of Pennsylvania, great state of North Carolina, the great state of Florida, the great state of South Carolina.' (Applause.) Remember they said we were going to lose Texas? They didn't say that. You know, look, they're crooked as hell. (Laughter.) But they did say , remember? They said, 'Texas is in play.' (Laughter.) So being somewhat new to the game , like having done it for about three months , I said, 'Let me ask you a question. What does it mean when they say it's in play?' 'Sir, that means it's too close to call.' Well, I'm like six or seven months out. They're saying Texas is in play. So I said, 'I don't think so.' I went to make a speech. We had a line that was miles long. I don't think so. And everybody else was telling me , a great guy got on in Texas, and he's wearing this big cowboy hat, this beautiful hat. I wish we could wear them. Nobody would ever look at my hair and criticize me. (Laughter.) I'd wear that hat and I'd never take it off. Do you ever notice, in Texas, they sit down and have breakfast here , they're wearing the hat. I like that. I would do that. (Laughter.) I don't have to worry about hairspray. I don't have to worry about my hair blowing , (laughter) , beautifully blowing in the wind. (Laughter.) And this guy is on television. A big, strong Texas guy. And they asked him about the race being so close. This is like five months before the election. He said, 'I don't know where you come from, but I come from Texas. And I'll tell you a couple of things, but one of the things I'll tell you for real: This race ain't close at all.' (Laughter.) 'Trump is going to win by a lot.' So we get to the evening, and they're saying, 'Texas is in play. It's too close. It's ' The polls close at eight o'clock. Now, unless you have a huge, commanding lead, you know, it's takes an hour, two hours, three hours before they predict, right? Before they say who won. And the polls closed. 'The polls have closed in Texas. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.' (Laughter and applause.) And for like six months , and then, today, I heard it again. I think , I think it was Buttigieg. (Laughter.) Buttigieg. They said, 'Think of it as 'boot' and then 'edge-edge.' Because nobody can pronounce this guy's name. (Laughter.) Nobody. Butt-i-gieg. They say, 'Buttigieg' , (laughter) , 'and Trump.' (Laughter.) On what I've done for energy, if anybody beat me in Texas , I don't think anybody can beat me. I don't think Rockefeller can beat me in Texas , the real Rockefeller, the first Rockefeller. I think he'd have a hard time beating me in Texas. But anyway, they said, 'Buttigieg ' (Laughter.) Can you believe this guy? He's doing a rotten job running his own city. Lousy job. But they say, 'Buttigieg is two points up in the state of Texas against President Trump.' I said, 'I don't think so. I don't think so.' No, I don't worry about that too much. What do you think, Louie? Who's winning Texas? Think Buttigieg is winning Texas? (Laughter.) I've had him up to here. (Laughter and applause.) Democrats care more about illegal aliens than their own constituents. Republicans know our duty is to represent American citizens. Democrats voted against Kate's Law. How about , what's Kate's Law , how about this? And now, they even threw out the charge about gun possession, which was like the smallest , he got away with murder. He got away , can you imagine? But it's not over yet. It's not over yet. What a horrible thing took place in San Francisco with that incredible, beautiful young woman, holding her father's hand and saying, 'Daddy. Daddy, what happened?' Can you imagine the shock of it? That's just incredible. And this low-life gets out. Gets out. And people all over the world see that, and they say, 'What the hell is wrong with the United States of America?' , when they see that. Last year, more than 80 percent of House Democrats refused to support our heroes , ICE. And nearly every House Democrat voted in favor of sanctuary cities, allowing illegal aliens with severe criminal records to terrorize innocent communities. And these two guys were tremendously successful in North Carolina because all we kept doing is saying the governor and all of these Democrats , right, Dan? , all of the Democrats want sanctuary cities. And they let somebody out fairly recently, and that somebody wreaked havoc. Wreaked havoc. I won't even tell you, it was so horrible. But wreaked havoc in a community. Instead of taking him and giving him to ICE , we would have done what you had to do. But I'll tell you, the folks of ICE , at ICE , and Border Patrol and law enforcement, they're not treated properly. And we respect them. Most Americans really respect them. (Applause.) Yeah. (Applause.) You know, we have MS-13 coming in. These are the toughest people you've ever seen, but they're not as tough as ICE. And ICE runs into their nests. You know, they call them a 'nest.' This is , these are people that don't even like guns because they're not painful enough. They take young women and they slice them up with a knife. They slice them up , beautiful, young , in a case, two 16-year-old young girls walking home from school. They took them and they sliced them up because it was more painful. They killed them. Animals. And then, if you use the term 'animal' , I mean, look, you know, Nancy Pelosi attacked me because I called them 'animals.' Remember that? She said, 'They're not animals. They're human beings.' Well, I don't think so. But ICE will go into a nest. They call it a 'nest' , where you have a lot of them congregating, up to no good. And ICE will run into that nest like it's , like they're having breakfast with their family on Monday morning. They're tough. And they're patriots, and they love our country. And we're throwing out MS-13 by the thousands. We're throwing them , we're getting them the hell out of our country. (Applause.) And even tough sheriffs say, 'You know, sir, better that they do it.' And I agree with them. Better that they do it. And the sheriffs agree. But they say, 'Better that they do it.' And then you have the Democrats. They want to keep them around. And they want to actually take care of them and protect them. And, I don't know, if you tell me that's good politics. And I don't even care about the politics. But it's so bad for our country. But if you tell me you can win with that , with open borders, with no ICE. If you don't have ICE, this country would be overridden. We take out thousands of people , bad people. Really bad people. Public servants make a sacred pledge to defend the nation and its people. Politicians who support sanctuary cities have forsaken this solemn vow. Instead of making a shameful pact to shield and harbor criminal fugitives at any cost , they will do it at any cost. But I'll tell you, people in California , and I see it more and more , they don't want sanctuary cities; it's the politicians that want them. A lot of the people are revolting in different communities. They don't want sanctuary cities. They want to be safe. They can't be safe with sanctuary cities. They're protecting, in many cases, criminals. In July, Montgomery County, Maryland, declared itself a sanctuary city for criminal aliens, forcing local jails to release these dangerous inmates, instead of safely handing them over to ICE. Just hand them over to ICE. Just hand them over to ICE. ICE will take care of the rest. Less than two months later, eight illegal aliens have already been arrested for rape, for sexual assault of a minor. Last month, local officials in Montgomery County released an accused criminal alien rapist back onto the streets, defying ICE's very powerful request to turn him over to them. In March, local officials in Durham County, North Carolina, ignored ICE and released an illegal alien arrested on felony robbery charges. A short time later, that same illegal alien was charged with murder of a 19-year-old woman in Georgia. This is happening, by the way, in over , these are stories I could , I could give you these stories all day long. I love the Angel Moms. I just love those women. I got , women and families , but I got to know a lot of them, what they've suffered and how they've suffered. And they're scorned by the radical Left. They're scorned. Who could scorn a person who lost their daughter put in an ashcan and burned? Stuffed into an ashcan and burned. And they find the person and it's like , who can , who can even , who could endure what they've been through? And it happens a lot. A few stories. It happens a lot. Far worse than what I'm telling you tonight. Far, far worse. Democrats believe our cities should be sanctuaries for violent criminal aliens. Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans. (Applause.) Democrats also believe any illegally alien who merely sets foot on U.S. soil should be automatically released into the interior of the United States and then given free healthcare for life. These craven policies impoverish U.S. communities while enriching human smugglers, traffickers, and vicious criminal cartels. Two hundred and eight House Democrats, nearly 90 percent of the Democrat Caucus, also voted against notifying ICE whenever an illegal alien tries to buy a gun. Meanwhile, Democrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans, so they're totally defenseless when somebody walks into their house with a gun. It's like, 'Whatever you want. Whatever you want. I'm defenseless. Whatever you want.' How crazy is this? Republicans will forever uphold the fundamental right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) Thank you. The agenda of the Democrat Party is the demolition of the American middle class, because that's what happens. Our Republican agenda is to make our neighborhoods safer, our families stronger, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. And we're on our way to doing it, but we have to win this next election. You know, I said the other day , and I don't know if anyone said it before, but it sounds like it should have been said many times before , but it's like a plant. You grow the plant. You put the plant in, but it hasn't really grabbed on yet. And it won't grab on; it needs a little time. We need a little time. We've done tremendous changes in our country. Tremendous changes. And we're going to do other changes. A lot of really great other changes. But we need that additional time to let it grab on, because they will destroy so much of what we've done, and we can't let that happen. You won't have energy. You won't have business. You won't have jobs. You won't have income. It will be a disaster. So you have to fight like hell. I tell the story of a man who hates me. One of the most successful businesspeople always hated me and I've always hated him. I can't stand that guy. (Laughter.) And I meet him recently and I see him, and he's working with my people on helping us out with fundraisers and everything. I say, 'What are you doing here?' 'I'm trying to help you get elected.' I said, 'You got to be kidding me.' And then, I looked at him and I said, 'But actually, you do have no choice.' Isn't it true? You don't have a choice. He said, 'No, I really respect what you've done over the last three years' , almost three years now , 'and I really respect, and it's been great for business, and it's been great for jobs. I have many more people working for me than I had when you became President. And it's really incredible what's happened.' And for the first time in my entire life, I really like this guy. (Laughter.) Although, he's a tough guy. He's a bad guy. But, no, he's one of many. I go to audiences , I was joking one time recently. I walked up to him; I said, 'Listen, I don't have to make a very long speech. You really have to elect me. Whether you like me or not, it makes no difference, because our country will go to hell. If any of these people get in, it will go to hell. So I'm going to leave now. Goodbye everybody.' And I joked. And then I came back and I talked. But I said, 'You know, I was joking, but I'm really not joking. You have no choice.' Because whoever they put in, the saner they are, the worse they're doing. And whoever they put in , and it looks like it's going to be a revolution to the Left , they're going to take your money. They're going to take , and very much hurt your families. I just don't think people can allow that to happen. We have a country that's doing, I think, better than ever before. The economy is the strongest it's ever been. Most powerful, our military , all of the things we've discussed. You have to fight so hard that we win this election. You have to fight so hard. I had a big meeting today on ethanol and the farmers, and it was an incredible meeting. And I sat around, and Chuck Grassley was there and Joni Ernst and John Thune and Mike Pounds and so many , just a whole group of great people. And just sitting around the room. Ben Sasse, who's actually become very good over the last year , we had a little arguments before, but doesn't matter , Ben Sasse was there. We had just a great group of people. And as were sitting in the Oval Office talking about farmers, I realized that all of these people have to make sure that we win because the farmers will be totally put out of business. Many businesses will be put out of business. I just don't even know what they're thinking. What are they doing? What are they doing? And I said to some of the people around the table, strong Republicans, but really people that just love the country. I said, 'You really have to make sure that we win, because if you don't, this country is in such trouble.' So I used to talk about 2016 as being a very important election, and it was. But in its own way, this is , I'll never say 'of' , of, you know, 'more important,' but I can almost say 'of equal importance' because everything that we've done, everything that we've gained , and the biggest gains are to come because the hard work of getting it approved. You people were involved with so much of it. It was so hard and we got things done. I mean, those tax cuts , all the things we did are so hard. We would have had healthcare done, and we will get it done if we get back the House and if we keep the Senate and keep the presidency, we'll get it done. We would have had healthcare done except for , (applause) , we had one little surprising vote late in the evening. But we would have had it done. We would have had it done, and we'll get it done. If we get back the House, we're going to get it done, as sure as you can be. But even on healthcare, we've done such a good job, and with the individual mandate and all of the other things we've been able to do. We're fighting for everyday citizens who work hard, pay their taxes, raise their children, follow our laws, serve our communities, respect our police, and believe in America with their every ounce, really, of their heart and their soul. We're fighting to protect their jobs, to defend their families, and to ensure their children can live the American Dream. You know, the Republican Party is actually loved in this country. And I think, in a certain way, loved like never before, because we they see that we're fighting for this country. We're fighting for what we grew up with. What , the values that we want. The Republican Party , you know, some people probably take it a little bit for granted, but you really are; you're loved out there. I see it. I see it all the time. Whenever I went , I saw it in North Carolina the other day. I'm backstage waiting to go on, and so many people have come up to me and they say, 'Sir, thank you for saving our nation.' Well, you're equal to me. What you , what you've done is incredible. Some of the things that you've done in a short period of time is pretty damn incredible. (Applause.) A nation's first duty is to care for its own citizens, and that is why we're working to give the American people a high-quality, low-cost , and this is what's going to happen , we want a low-cost healthcare system with more transparency and more choice. You know, we're doing transparency. I think you've all seen that. And a man came in who's an expert , he's a tremendous, tremendous man who I have a lot of respect for , and he said, 'Transparency.' I said, 'Explain transparency.' Sounds very simple. And I got it done. This is where people can go to hospitals and price, and they can pick their doctor. He said, 'Sir, this is bigger than any healthcare you can do. You watch.' And it will be put into effect , Secretary Azar, who's doing an incredible job , it will be put into effect fairly soon. We signed it about four months ago. It's being worked out. People are able to go in and negotiate the prices. You know, you have these horror stories where a woman will cut her hand and go into a hospital. You don't ask how much. But they'll go into a hospital and have the hand, and then they'll get billed $5,000. And they don't have $5,000. The horror stories are unbelievable. And we went through it. And some of you were in the room when I did signings. But we're having transparency, where you can have lists of prices. When you have some problem, they list it. You can go and negotiate prices. You can go to the drug store and say, 'Well, we want to see, how much is that? How much ' You know, right now you can't even do that. They don't let you do that. But now we do. And we've opened that up too. We've done a lot. Right to Try is something we've done a great job , you people have. (Applause.) You have to see the results on Right to Try. But a person can be terminally ill in the old system, and we could have a drug that we know works but is still going to take another year or two of testing, and we tell the person, 'I'm sorry, we can't let you use that drug because it may hurt you.' Well, you're going to die within three weeks or four weeks. You're terminally ill. They've wanted to do this for 45 years. And it's not as easy as all that. The country was worried that they'll sue the country. The doctors were worried they'd sue the doctors through the insurance companies, sue the pharmaceutical companies. I got everybody into a room. I said, 'Listen, what we do is we sign an agreement where we guarantee ' , and a tough agreement , ' where you guarantee that we have no liability, the doctor has no liability, the pharmaceutical company has no liability, and various other things.' I said, 'And everybody's happy.' Then they said, 'Well, we don't want them on the list.' If a person is terminally ill, the pharmaceutical companies , I understood that. 'We don't want them on our list.' Because they do a list of success. 'And when a person is very, very sick , maybe toward the end of their life, terminally ill , we don't want that person on our list as a sample, as a test sample.' I said, 'I understand that. So we're not going to have that person on your list. When you do this, we're not going to have that person on your list. We create a separate list of very, very sick, terminally ill people. But for your list, we're not going to put it.' They said, 'Wow, we like that.' And we got it signed. And you have to see the success. People used to go to Asia. They'd go to Europe. They'd go all over the world looking, if they had money. Most people didn't have the money, so they'd go home and they'd die. Now they have the Right to Try. And I congratulate you on that because you were the ones that really did a job. (Applause.) And Greg was great , wherever Greg may be. Is Greg here? Greg? Where's Greg? Oh, boy, you stood up fast. That's good. (Applause.) Thank you, Greg. I'd call Greg and I'd say, 'Man, you've got to get it done.' And it wasn't easy like people would've thought. Do you agree with that? That was not easy. We had more people coming at us , thank you very much, Greg. It was a fantastic job. And a lot of other folks in the room. That's why we're ending years of economic surrender and we're confronting China's chronic trading abuses. For years, past leaders let China freely loot our economy, racking up trillions and trillions of dollars in costly trade deficits. Now, the world is on notice that people aren't going to be able to do that to the United States anymore. They're not doing it anymore, and they know it. They know it. They get it. They come to me and they see me , the leaders. I know them all now, pretty much. Some I have great respect for. Some I don't get along with as well. You know, there was a poll recently that Obama is much more popular in Germany than I am. I said, 'Of course he is.' He's not saying to Germany, 'You've got to pay us for the military.' He's not saying to Germany, 'Why are you paying billions and billions of dollars to Russia for a pipeline coming in?' And then we defend , how about that one? We pay billions of dollars to Russia and then we defend Germany from Russia. Figure , does that work, right? (Laughter.) Does that work? Give Russia billions and then we defend you. Oh, that's a wonderful deal. We've got plenty of those deals. That's one of the better ones. With your help, we will also achieve a historic victory for the American farmer, rancher, and workers by replacing the horrible disaster , to me, one of the worst deals ever , NAFTA. And we're replacing it with the USMCA, which really is incredible. (Applause.) Got to get it up for a vote. They've got to put it up for a vote. By the way, the Democrats are going to vote for it. Unions love it. Farmers love it. I would say unions like it. But they like it. They hate NAFTA. It's their all-time least. Manufacturers love it. The farmers are desperate for it; it's so important. And let it be bipartisan. I told Nancy Pelosi. 'Nancy, put it up for a vote. It's going to bipartisan. You can have all the credit you want. You have to do something other than try and impeach somebody that didn't do anything wrong. You have to.' (Laughter.) I said, 'It's hard to impeach somebody who didn't do anything wrong.' The Mueller report is out. There's no collusion, after two and a half years. Think of it. How ridiculous: I collude with Russia. In fact, Russia said, 'You know, if we really did pick him, we made a real bad choice.' (Laughter.) Think of it. Even tonight, I'm talking about we have the strongest military. We're spending billions and billions. We're the strongest military, right? We have the strongest energy. Hillary wanted windmills. She wanted solar. Solar is fine , you know, small potatoes, compared to what we're talking about. It doesn't have the power that you need. And someday, good. I love solar. I think solar is good, but it's limited. The wind is very expensive because you put up those windmills , I know it very well. First of all, they're made in Germany and they're made in China. Think of the pollutants that go on the air when they're making these massive steel things. If it's anywhere near your house, your house is way down in value. Try dropping a windmill someplace close to your house. Try selling your house. They make noise. They kill all the birds. The energy is intermittent. If you happen to be watching the Democrat debate and the wind isn't blowing, you're not going to the see the debate. 'Charlie, what the hell happened to this debate?' (Laughter.) He says, 'Darling, the wind isn't blowing. The goddamn windmill stopped. That windmill stopped.' (Laughter.) Republicans know that American families are the true backbone of America. That is why I was the first President to propose nationwide paid family leave in my budget. Very important. (Applause.) Women want it. Our goal is to ensure that every American family enjoys an amazing quality of life. Together, we are going to fix our housing finance system. We're working on that very hard , to protect the dream of ownership for the next generation. We're going to make new cars more affordable and much safer. My administration will soon issue standards that will save families thousands and thousands, as I've said, of dollars per car. We're going to fight for the future of cities like Baltimore that have been destroyed by decades of failed and corrupt rule. (Applause.) The left-wing agenda of total government domination, crushing regulation, crippling taxes, unrestricted migration, and un- , and I mean, think of this , it's undermining all law enforcement. They undermine law enforcement and they devastate America's inner cities. They've been devastated. And even the cities like Los Angeles , look at what's happening. It's like , look at what's happening. San Francisco. Take a look at what's going on. And we're going to have to step in and do something about it because we can't allow that to happen to our great cities. Los Angeles is a great city. (Applause.) We can't allow it. And in the not-too-distant future, you're going to see. We're going to step in. We're not going to allow it to happen, where major, major companies are leaving their cities. They're leaving our country when they see that. You walk in. They pay a lot of rent. They walk into a beautiful building , the best street in California. And you have a site that nobody even can believe. Nobody can believe. And we're going to have to do something about it. And we will do something about it. We're going to give them notice. In fact, we gave them a notice a today: Clean it up. You got to do something. You can't have it. These are our great American cities and they're an embarrassment, what the Democrats have let happen. Republicans want to rebuild our inner cities and provide a future of limitless opportunity for all Americans. And Republicans believe that parents should have the right to send their kids to the school of their choice. (Applause.) So, just in concluding, in everything we do, Republicans are fighting for the values that bring us together as one nation, under God. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand up for the heroes of law enforcement. We reject globalism and we embrace patriotism. We believe that there is no treasure on Earth more valuable than our American citizenship. (Applause.) We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, cherish our heroes, and always respect our great American flag. (Applause.) These are the values that unite us tonight. These are the values that bind our country. These are the values the American people share, deep in their souls. And these are the values that Republicans will champion all across the land. And that's what's happening. And that's why people love what you're doing. That's why people are loving the Republican Party again. (Applause.) Our task is to be confident in these truths, certain of this vision, bold in our actions, and forever loyal to the citizens we serve. If we stay true to our mission , and we have to, and we have to stick together like they do. They've got nothing else on us, but, like I said, they stick together. If we remain firm in our convictions, if we always put America first, then there will be no limit to the progress that we will make, no bounds to the good that we will do, no ceiling on the heights that we will reach, and no end to the victories we will achieve. We will win, win, win. And we will keep on winning. You know, I tell that story and some people love it, and probably some don't, but I think they all love it. I'm going to win a place like , here we go. I'm going to use Dan as an example. I'm in North Carolina, and I'm going to say, 'We're going to win again. We're going to win so much.' Right, Dan? We're going to so much. We're going to win, win, win. (Applause.) And our country , you go back and we haven't been doing so much winning with trade and with all of these different things. And I'm going to go , I'm going to go to Dan Bishop, and I'm going to say, 'Dan, we're going to win.' And they're going to come in to see Dan. They're going to say, 'Please, please, stop the President from winning. We're winning so much. Dan, go visit. You're our new congressman. Go to the Oval Office. He respects you because, unlike these other people, he doesn't know you so well. So you are still respected.' (Laughter.) 'And please, see the President and talk to the President. Tell him to stop winning so much. We don't want to win so much in the great state of North Carolina.' And I'm going to say, 'Dan, I'm sorry. I'm not doing that. We're going to keep winning, winning, winning.' Right, Dan? We're going to keep winning, winning, winning. (Applause.) Congratulations. After all we've achieved and after everything that we've accomplished, our message is simple: The best is yet to come. (Applause.) The best is yet to come. Together, we will make America stronger, and safer, and prouder, and greater than ever before. And I want to thank everybody for being tonight. You are a terrific group and I know almost all of you. I like most of you. I know all of you. (Laughter.) No, you are. You're a terrific group, and I think we're going to have a terrific, long time together. And Kevin, and everybody, I want to thank you. This was an incredible evening. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)"}

Thank you very much. That's very nice. And I want to thank Mike. Today, it's a true honor to be the first President of the United States to host a meeting at the United Nations on religious freedom. And an honor it is. It's long overdue. And I was shocked when I was given that statistic that I would be the first. That's very sad, in many ways. And it's great to be with you. I want to thank Vice President Pence for the outstanding job he's doing. He's been a fantastic and valuable representative of our country. Likewise, Secretary Mike Pompeo, Ambassador Kelly Craft, Secretary Ross, Secretary Mnuchin, Ambassador Sam Brownback all for joining us today. And we have other representatives of our Cabinet and the administration in the room. We've done a lot. The Johnson Amendment doesn't get spoken about enough, but I'm very proud to say that we've obliterated the Johnson Amendment within our country so that now we can listen to the people that we want to listen to , religious leaders , without recrimination against them. It's a very important thing, and I said that at the beginning and I say it now: It's something I'm very proud of. We're also grateful that U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres could be here, along with so many of his friends and my friends , world leaders. I've gotten to know a lot of them, and I would imagine you know all of them. I would imagine. If you don't, you're not doing your job. (Laughter.) And also, I want to thank my daughter Ivanka for being here. She works so hard on all of the things that are very important to the people in this room. So, thank you, Ivanka, for being here. (Applause.) The United States is founded on the principle that our rights do not come from government; they come from God. This immortal truth is proclaimed in our Declaration of Independence and enshrined in the First Amendment to our Constitution's Bill of Rights. Our Founders understood that no right is more fundamental to a peaceful, prosperous, and virtuous society than the right to follow one's religious convictions. Regrettably, the religious freedom enjoyed by American citizens is rare in the world. Approximately 80 percent of the world's population live in countries where religious liberty is threatened, restricted, or even banned. And when I heard that number, I said, \"Please go back and check it because it can't possibly be correct.\" And, sadly, it was. Eighty percent. As we speak, Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Yazidis, and many other people of faith are being jailed, sanctioned, tortured, and even murdered, often at the hands of their own government, simply for expressing their deeply held religious beliefs. So hard to believe. Today, with one clear voice, the United States of America calls upon the nations of the world to end religious persecution. (Applause.) To stop the crimes against people of faith, release prisoners of conscience, repeal laws restricting freedom of religion and belief, protect the vulnerable, the defenseless, and the oppressed, America stands with believers in every country who ask only for the freedom to live according to the faith that is within their own hearts. As President, protecting religious freedom is one of my highest priorities and always has been. Last year, our Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, hosted the first-ever Ministerial to Advance International Religious Freedom. In this year's ministerial, Secretary Pompeo announced plans to create the International Religious Freedom Alliance , an alliance of likeminded nations devoted to confronting religious persecution all around the world. I've appointed a special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism. We're standing up for almost 250 million Christians around the world who are persecuted for their faith. It is estimated that 11 Christians are killed every day for the following , I mean, just think of this: Eleven Christians a day, for following the teachings of Christ. Who would even think that's possible in this day and age? Who would think it's possible? With us today is Pastor Andrew Brunson, who was imprisoned in Turkey for a long period of time. Last year, my administration was thrilled to bring him back home after a very short and respectful negotiation with a very strong man , and a man who has become a friend of mine, fortunately , President Erdo\u011fan of Turkey. I called the President, and I said, \"He's an innocent man.\" They've been trying to get Andrew out for a long time , previous administration. I don't think they tried too hard, unfortunately. But I want to thank President Erdo\u011fan, and I want to thank you, Pastor, for being here with us today. Where is Andrew? Is he around someplace? Thank you, Andrew. (Applause.) We did a good job with that negotiation, Andrew. You got back. It wasn't easy. It wasn't pretty. But you got back. And we're proud of you. You have a great family. And the love , when Andrew came back, the love from so many people, it was , actually, I hadn't seen anything quite like it. So, congratulations. And I understand you're doing fantastic work with your family. Thank you very much. Thank you, Andrew. (Applause.) And I also want to thank Franklin Graham because he's been so instrumental in everything we're doing. He's done such an incredible job in so many different ways, including floods and hurricanes. And every time I go, I see Franklin there. He's always there before me. I don't know how he gets there before me. I'm going to beat him one day. But he's always at these places of , really, disaster areas. He's right there with an incredible, large staff of volunteers that are just amazing. Thank you very much. And, CeCe, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you very much. And, Paula White, thank you very much. In July, I met with survivors of religious persecution at the White House. And we're honored that many of them could be here today as well. Some of these individuals suffered as a result of state-sponsored persecution; others, at the hands of terrorists and criminals. No matter the case, America will always be a voice for victims of religious persecution everywhere. No matter where you go, you have a place in the United States of America. Could I ask those folks to stand up, please? Please, stand up. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. In recent times, the world has also witnessed devastating acts of violence in sacred places of worship. In 2016, an 85-year-old Catholic priest was viciously killed while celebrating mass in Normandy, France. In the past year, the United States endured horrifying anti-Semitic attacks against Jewish Americans at synagogues in Pennsylvania and California. In March, Muslims praying with their families were sadistically murdered in New Zealand. On Easter Sunday this year, terrorists bombed Christian churches in Sri Lanka, killing hundreds of faithful worshippers. Who would believe this is even possible? These evil attacks are a wound on all humanity. We must all work together to protect communities of every faith. We're also urging every nation to increase the prosecution and punishment of crimes against religious communities. There can be no greater crime than that. This includes measures to prevent the intentional destruction of religious sites and relics. Today, the Trump administration will dedicate an additional $25 million to protect religious freedom and religious sites and relics. We're also pleased to be joined today by many of the partners from the business community, as we announce a very critical initiative. The United States is forming a coalition of U.S. businesses for the protection of religious freedom. This is the first time this has been done. This initiative will encourage the private sector to protect people of all faiths in the workplace. And the private sector has brilliant leadership. And that's why some of the people in this room are among the most successful men and women on Earth. They know how things get done and they know how to take care of things. And they're with us now for the first time, to this extent. First time, ever. And we're really honored to have you in the room. Great business leaders, great people of strength. Too often, people in positions of power preach diversity while silencing, shunning, or censoring the faithful. True tolerance means respecting the right of all people to express their deeply held religious beliefs. Before I conclude, I want to once again thank all of the survivors in the room for their courage and resilience. You're an inspiration to the world. You remind us that no force on Earth is stronger than the faith of religious believers. The United States of America will forever remain at your side and the side of all who seek religious freedom. Today, I ask all nations to join us in this urgent moral duty. We ask the governments of the world to honor the eternal right of every person to follow their conscience, live by their faith, and give glory to God. The United States has a vital role in this critical mission. Secretary-General Guterres will now share a few words on the U.N's efforts to promote religious liberty for all. And he has been a champion of exactly what we're in this room for. So I want to thank everybody for being here. God bless you. God bless the faithful. And God bless America. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. END 11:58 A.M.

You remind us that no force on Earth is stronger than the faith of religious believers. The United States of America will forever remain at your side and the side of all who seek religious freedom. Today, I ask all nations to join us in this urgent moral duty. We ask the governments of the world to honor the eternal right of every person to follow their conscience, live by their faith, and give glory to God. The United States has a vital role in this critical mission. Secretary-General Guterres will now share a few words on the U.N's efforts to promote religious liberty for all. And he has been a champion of exactly what we're in this room for. So I want to thank everybody for being here. God bless you. God bless the faithful. And God bless America. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you."}
{"SpeechID":"VSDT2492019464","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2019-09-24","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump to the 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly","Type":"speech","RawText":"PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, distinguished delegates, ambassadors, and world leaders: Seven decades of history have passed through this hall, in all of their richness and drama. Where I stand, the world has heard from presidents and premiers at the height of the Cold War. We have seen the foundation of nations. We have seen the ringleaders of revolution. We have beheld saints who inspired us with hope, rebels who stirred us with passion, and heroes who emboldened us with courage , all here to share plans, proposals, visions, and ideas on the world's biggest stage. Like those who met us before, our time is one of great contests, high stakes, and clear choices. The essential divide that runs all around the world and throughout history is once again thrown into stark relief. It is the divide between those whose thirst for control deludes them into thinking they are destined to rule over others and those people and nations who want only to rule themselves. I have the immense privilege of addressing you today as the elected leader of a nation that prizes liberty, independence, and self-government above all. The United States, after having spent over two and a half trillion dollars since my election to completely rebuild our great military, is also, by far, the world's most powerful nation. Hopefully, it will never have to use this power. Americans know that in a world where others seek conquest and domination, our nation must be strong in wealth, in might, and in spirit. That is why the United States vigorously defends the traditions and customs that have made us who we are. Like my beloved country, each nation represented in this hall has a cherished history, culture, and heritage that is worth defending and celebrating, and which gives us our singular potential and strength. The free world must embrace its national foundations. It must not attempt to erase them or replace them. Looking around and all over this large, magnificent planet, the truth is plain to see: If you want freedom, take pride in your country. If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty. And if you want peace, love your nation. Wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first. The future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots. The future belongs to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors, and honor the differences that make each country special and unique. It is why we in the United States have embarked on an exciting program of national renewal. In everything we do, we are focused on empowering the dreams and aspirations of our citizens. Thanks to our pro-growth economic policies, our domestic unemployment rate reached its lowest level in over half a century. Fueled by massive tax cuts and regulations cuts, jobs are being produced at a historic rate. Six million Americans have been added to the employment rolls in under three years. Last month, African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment reached their lowest rates ever recorded. We are marshaling our nation's vast energy abundance, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. Wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and 2.5 million Americans have been lifted out of poverty in less than three years. As we rebuild the unrivaled might of the American military, we are also revitalizing our alliances by making it very clear that all of our partners are expected to pay their fair share of the tremendous defense burden, which the United States has borne in the past. At the center of our vision for national renewal is an ambitious campaign to reform international trade. For decades, the international trading system has been easily exploited by nations acting in very bad faith. As jobs were outsourced, a small handful grew wealthy at the expense of the middle class. In America, the result was 4.2 million lost manufacturing jobs and $15 trillion in trade deficits over the last quarter century. The United States is now taking that decisive action to end this grave economic injustice. Our goal is simple: We want balanced trade that is both fair and reciprocal. We have worked closely with our partners in Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA with the brand new and hopefully bipartisan U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Tomorrow, I will join Prime Minister Abe of Japan to continue our progress in finalizing a terrific new trade deal. As the United Kingdom makes preparations to exit the European Union, I have made clear that we stand ready to complete an exceptional new trade agreement with the UK that will bring tremendous benefits to both of our countries. We are working closely with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on a magnificent new trade deal. The most important difference in America's new approach on trade concerns our relationship with China. In 2001, China was admitted to the World Trade Organization. Our leaders then argued that this decision would compel China to liberalize its economy and strengthen protections to provide things that were unacceptable to us, and for private property and for the rule of law. Two decades later, this theory has been tested and proven completely wrong. Not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers, and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale. As just one example, I recently met the CEO of a terrific American company, Micron Technology, at the White House. Micron produces memory chips used in countless electronics. To advance the Chinese government's five-year economic plan, a company owned by the Chinese state allegedly stole Micron's designs, valued at up to $8.7 billion. Soon, the Chinese company obtains patents for nearly an identical product, and Micron was banned from selling its own goods in China. But we are seeking justice. The United States lost 60,000 factories after China entered the WTO. This is happening to other countries all over the globe. The World Trade Organization needs drastic change. The second-largest economy in the world should not be permitted to declare itself a \"developing country\" in order to game the system at others' expense. For years, these abuses were tolerated, ignored, or even encouraged. Globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders, causing them to ignore their own national interests. But as far as America is concerned, those days are over. To confront these unfair practices, I placed massive tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese-made goods. Already, as a result of these tariffs, supply chains are relocating back to America and to other nations, and billions of dollars are being paid to our Treasury. The American people are absolutely committed to restoring balance to our relationship with China. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement that would be beneficial for both countries. But as I have made very clear, I will not accept a bad deal for the American people. As we endeavor to stabilize our relationship, we're also carefully monitoring the situation in Hong Kong. The world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty, made with the British and registered with the United Nations, in which China commits to protect Hong Kong's freedom, legal system, and democratic ways of life. How China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future. We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader. The United States does not seek conflict with any other nation. We desire peace, cooperation, and mutual gain with all. But I will never fail to defend America's interests. One of the greatest security threats facing peace-loving nations today is the repressive regime in Iran. The regime's record of death and destruction is well known to us all. Not only is Iran the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism, but Iran's leaders are fueling the tragic wars in both Syria and Yemen. At the same time, the regime is squandering the nation's wealth and future in a fanatical quest for nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. We must never allow this to happen. To stop Iran's path to nuclear weapons and missiles, I withdrew the United States from the terrible Iran nuclear deal, which has very little time remaining, did not allow inspection of important sites, and did not cover ballistic missiles.Following our withdrawal, we have implemented severe economic sanctions on the country. Hoping to free itself from sanctions, the regime has escalated its violent and unprovoked aggression. In response to Iran's recent attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, we just imposed the highest level of sanctions on Iran's central bank and sovereign wealth fund. All nations have a duty to act. No responsible government should subsidize Iran's bloodlust. As long as Iran's menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted; they will be tightened. Iran's leaders will have turned a proud nation into just another cautionary tale of what happens when a ruling class abandons its people and embarks on a crusade for personal power and riches. For 40 years, the world has listened to Iran's rulers as they lash out at everyone else for the problems they alone have created. They conduct ritual chants of \"Death to America\" and traffic in monstrous anti-Semitism. Last year the country's Supreme Leader stated, \"Israel is a malignant cancerous tumor that has to be removed and eradicated: it is possible and it will happen.\" America will never tolerate such anti-Semitic hate. Fanatics have long used hatred of Israel to distract from their own failures. Thankfully, there is a growing recognition in the wider Middle East that the countries of the region share common interests in battling extremism and unleashing economic opportunity. That is why it is so important to have full, normalized relations between Israel and its neighbors. Only a relationship built on common interests, mutual respect, and religious tolerance can forge a better future. Iran's citizens deserve a government that cares about reducing poverty, ending corruption, and increasing jobs , not stealing their money to fund a massacre abroad and at home. After four decades of failure, it is time for Iran's leaders to step forward and to stop threatening other countries, and focus on building up their own country. It is time for Iran's leaders to finally put the Iranian people first. America is ready to embrace friendship with all who genuinely seek peace and respect. Many of America's closest friends today were once our gravest foes. The United States has never believed in permanent enemies. We want partners, not adversaries. America knows that while anyone can make war, only the most courageous can choose peace. For this same reason, we have pursued bold diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula. I have told Kim Jong Un what I truly believe: that, like Iran, his country is full of tremendous untapped potential, but that to realize that promise, North Korea must denuclearize. Around the world, our message is clear: America's goal is lasting, America's goal is harmony, and America's goal is not to go with these endless wars , wars that never end. With that goal in mind, my administration is also pursuing the hope of a brighter future in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the Taliban has chosen to continue their savage attacks. And we will continue to work with our coalition of Afghan partners to stamp out terrorism, and we will never stop working to make peace a reality. Here in the Western Hemisphere, we are joining with our partners to ensure stability and opportunity all across the region. In that mission, one of our most critical challenges is illegal immigration, which undermines prosperity, rips apart societies, and empowers ruthless criminal cartels. Mass illegal migration is unfair, unsafe, and unsustainable for everyone involved: the sending countries and the depleted countries. And they become depleted very fast, but their youth is not taken care of and human capital goes to waste. The receiving countries are overburdened with more migrants than they can responsibly accept. And the migrants themselves are exploited, assaulted, and abused by vicious coyotes. Nearly one third of women who make the journey north to our border are sexually assaulted along the way. Yet, here in the United States and around the world, there is a growing cottage industry of radical activists and non-governmental organizations that promote human smuggling. These groups encourage illegal migration and demand erasure of national borders. Today, I have a message for those open border activists who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice: Your policies are not just. Your policies are cruel and evil. You are empowering criminal organizations that prey on innocent men, women, and children. You put your own false sense of virtue before the lives, wellbeing, and [of] countless innocent people. When you undermine border security, you are undermining human rights and human dignity. Many of the countries here today are coping with the challenges of uncontrolled migration. Each of you has the absolute right to protect your borders, and so, of course, does our country. Today, we must resolve to work together to end human smuggling, end human trafficking, and put these criminal networks out of business for good. To our country, I can tell you sincerely: We are working closely with our friends in the region , including Mexico, Canada, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Panama , to uphold the integrity of borders and ensure safety and prosperity for our people. I would like to thank President L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico for the great cooperation we are receiving and for right now putting 27,000 troops on our southern border. Mexico is showing us great respect, and I respect them in return. The U.S., we have taken very unprecedented action to stop the flow of illegal immigration. To anyone considering crossings of our border illegally, please hear these words: Do not pay the smugglers. Do not pay the coyotes. Do not put yourself in danger. Do not put your children in danger. Because if you make it here, you will not be allowed in; you will be promptly returned home. You will not be released into our country. As long as I am President of the United States, we will enforce our laws and protect our borders. For all of the countries of the Western Hemisphere, our goal is to help people invest in the bright futures of their own nation. Our region is full of such incredible promise: dreams waiting to be built and national destinies for all. And they are waiting also to be pursued. Throughout the hemisphere, there are millions of hardworking, patriotic young people eager to build, innovate, and achieve. But these nations cannot reach their potential if a generation of youth abandon their homes in search of a life elsewhere. We want every nation in our region to flourish and its people to thrive in freedom and peace. In that mission, we are also committed to supporting those people in the Western Hemisphere who live under brutal oppression, such as those in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. According to a recent report from the U.N. Human Rights Council, women in Venezuela stand in line for 10 hours a day waiting for food. Over 15,000 people have been detained as political prisoners. Modern-day death squads are carrying out thousands of extrajudicial killings. The dictator Maduro is a Cuban puppet, protected by Cuban bodyguards, hiding from his own people while Cuba plunders Venezuela's oil wealth to sustain its own corrupt communist rule. Since I last spoke in this hall, the United States and our partners have built a historic coalition of 55 countries that recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela. To the Venezuelans trapped in this nightmare: Please know that all of America is united behind you. The United States has vast quantities of humanitarian aid ready and waiting to be delivered. We are watching the Venezuela situation very closely. We await the day when democracy will be restored, when Venezuela will be free, and when liberty will prevail throughout this hemisphere. One of the most serious challenges our countries face is the specter of socialism. It's the wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies. Events in Venezuela remind us all that socialism and communism are not about justice, they are not about equality, they are not about lifting up the poor, and they are certainly not about the good of the nation. Socialism and communism are about one thing only: power for the ruling class. Today, I repeat a message for the world that I have delivered at home: America will never be a socialist country. In the last century, socialism and communism killed 100 million people. Sadly, as we see in Venezuela, the death toll continues in this country. These totalitarian ideologies, combined with modern technology, have the power to excise [exercise] new and disturbing forms of suppression and domination. For this reason, the United States is taking steps to better screen foreign technology and investments and to protect our data and our security. We urge every nation present to do the same. Freedom and democracy must be constantly guarded and protected, both abroad and from within. We must always be skeptical of those who want conformity and control. Even in free nations, we see alarming signs and new challenges to liberty. A small number of social media platforms are acquiring immense power over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say. A permanent political class is openly disdainful, dismissive, and defiant of the will of the people. A faceless bureaucracy operates in secret and weakens democratic rule. Media and academic institutions push flat-out assaults on our histories, traditions, and values. In the United States, my administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech. A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people, and a free people must never, ever be enlisted in the cause of silencing, coercing, canceling, or blacklisting their own neighbors. As we defend American values, we affirm the right of all people to live in dignity. For this reason, my administration is working with other nations to stop criminalizing of homosexuality, and we stand in solidarity with LGBTQ people who live in countries that punish, jail, or execute individuals based upon sexual orientation. We are also championing the role of women in our societies. Nations that empower women are much wealthier, safer, and much more politically stable. It is therefore vital not only to a nation's prosperity, but also is vital to its national security, to pursue women's economic development. Guided by these principles, my administration launched the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiatives. The W-GDP is first-ever government-wide approach to women's economic empowerment, working to ensure that women all over the planet have the legal right to own and inherit property, work in the same industries as men, travel freely, and access credit and institutions. Yesterday, I was also pleased to host leaders for a discussion about an ironclad American commitment: protecting religious leaders and also protecting religious freedom. This fundamental right is under growing threat around the world. Hard to believe, but 80 percent of the world's population lives in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or even completely outlawed. Americans will never fire or tire in our effort to defend and promote freedom of worship and religion. We want and support religious liberty for all. Americans will also never tire of defending innocent life. We are aware that many United Nations projects have attempted to assert a global right to taxpayer-funded abortion on demand, right up until the moment of delivery. Global bureaucrats have absolutely no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life. Like many nations here today, we in America believe that every child , born and unborn , is a sacred gift from God. There is no circumstance under which the United States will allow international entries [entities] to trample on the rights of our citizens, including the right to self-defense. That is why, this year, I announced that we will never ratify the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, which would threaten the liberties of law-abiding American citizens. The United States will always uphold our constitutional right to keep and bear arms. We will always uphold our Second Amendment. The core rights and values America defends today were inscribed in America's founding documents. Our nation's Founders understood that there will always be those who believe they are entitled to wield power and control over others. Tyranny advances under many names and many theories, but it always comes down to the desire for domination. It protects not the interests of many, but the privilege of few. Our Founders gave us a system designed to restrain this dangerous impulse. They chose to entrust American power to those most invested in the fate of our nation: a proud and fiercely independent people. The true good of a nation can only be pursued by those who love it: by citizens who are rooted in its history, who are nourished by its culture, committed to its values, attached to its people, and who know that its future is theirs to build or theirs to lose. Patriots see a nation and its destiny in ways no one else can. Liberty is only preserved, sovereignty is only secured, democracy is only sustained, greatness is only realized, by the will and devotion of patriots. In their spirit is found the strength to resist oppression, the inspiration to forge legacy, the goodwill to seek friendship, and the bravery to reach for peace. Love of our nations makes the world better for all nations. So to all the leaders here today, join us in the most fulfilling mission a person could have, the most profound contribution anyone can make: Lift up your nations. Cherish your culture. Honor your histories. Treasure your citizens. Make your countries strong, and prosperous, and righteous. Honor the dignity of your people, and nothing will be outside of your reach. When our nations are greater, the future will be brighter, our people will be happier, and our partnerships will be stronger. With God's help, together we will cast off the enemies of liberty and overcome the oppressors of dignity. We will set new standards of living and reach new heights of human achievement. We will rediscover old truths, unravel old mysteries, and make thrilling new breakthroughs. And we will find more beautiful friendship and more harmony among nations than ever before. My fellow leaders, the path to peace and progress, and freedom and justice, and a better world for all humanity, begins at home. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the nations of the world. And God bless America. Thank you very much.

When you undermine border security, you are undermining human rights and human dignity. Many of the countries here today are coping with the challenges of uncontrolled migration. Each of you has the absolute right to protect your borders, and so, of course, does our country. Today, we must resolve to work together to end human smuggling, end human trafficking, and put these criminal networks out of business for good. To our country, I can tell you sincerely: We are working closely with our friends in the region , including Mexico, Canada, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Panama , to uphold the integrity of borders and ensure safety and prosperity for our people. I would like to thank President L\ufffdpez Obrador of Mexico for the great cooperation we are receiving and for right now putting 27,000 troops on our southern border. Mexico is showing us great respect, and I respect them in return. The U.S., we have taken very unprecedented action to stop the flow of illegal immigration. To anyone considering crossings of our border illegally, please hear these words: Do not pay the smugglers. Do not pay the coyotes. Do not put yourself in danger. Do not put your children in danger. Because if you make it here, you will not be allowed in; you will be promptly returned home. You will not be released into our country. As long as I am President of the United States, we will enforce our laws and protect our borders. For all of the countries of the Western Hemisphere, our goal is to help people invest in the bright futures of their own nation. Our region is full of such incredible promise: dreams waiting to be built and national destinies for all. And they are waiting also to be pursued. Throughout the hemisphere, there are millions of hardworking, patriotic young people eager to build, innovate, and achieve. But these nations cannot reach their potential if a generation of youth abandon their homes in search of a life elsewhere. We want every nation in our region to flourish and its people to thrive in freedom and peace. In that mission, we are also committed to supporting those people in the Western Hemisphere who live under brutal oppression, such as those in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. According to a recent report from the U.N. Human Rights Council, women in Venezuela stand in line for 10 hours a day waiting for food. Over 15,000 people have been detained as political prisoners. Modern-day death squads are carrying out thousands of extrajudicial killings. The dictator Maduro is a Cuban puppet, protected by Cuban bodyguards, hiding from his own people while Cuba plunders Venezuela's oil wealth to sustain its own corrupt communist rule. Since I last spoke in this hall, the United States and our partners have built a historic coalition of 55 countries that recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela. To the Venezuelans trapped in this nightmare: Please know that all of America is united behind you. The United States has vast quantities of humanitarian aid ready and waiting to be delivered. We are watching the Venezuela situation very closely. We await the day when democracy will be restored, when Venezuela will be free, and when liberty will prevail throughout this hemisphere. One of the most serious challenges our countries face is the specter of socialism. It's the wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies. Events in Venezuela remind us all that socialism and communism are not about justice, they are not about equality, they are not about lifting up the poor, and they are certainly not about the good of the nation. Socialism and communism are about one thing only: power for the ruling class. Today, I repeat a message for the world that I have delivered at home: America will never be a socialist country. In the last century, socialism and communism killed 100 million people. Sadly, as we see in Venezuela, the death toll continues in this country. These totalitarian ideologies, combined with modern technology, have the power to excise new and disturbing forms of suppression and domination. For this reason, the United States is taking steps to better screen foreign technology and investments and to protect our data and our security. We urge every nation present to do the same. Freedom and democracy must be constantly guarded and protected, both abroad and from within. We must always be skeptical of those who want conformity and control. Even in free nations, we see alarming signs and new challenges to liberty. A small number of social media platforms are acquiring immense power over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say. A permanent political class is openly disdainful, dismissive, and defiant of the will of the people. A faceless bureaucracy operates in secret and weakens democratic rule. Media and academic institutions push flat-out assaults on our histories, traditions, and values. In the United States, my administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech. A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people, and a free people must never, ever be enlisted in the cause of silencing, coercing, canceling, or blacklisting their own neighbors. As we defend American values, we affirm the right of all people to live in dignity. For this reason, my administration is working with other nations to stop criminalizing of homosexuality, and we stand in solidarity with LGBTQ people who live in countries that punish, jail, or execute individuals based upon sexual orientation. We are also championing the role of women in our societies. Nations that empower women are much wealthier, safer, and much more politically stable. It is therefore vital not only to a nation's prosperity, but also is vital to its national security, to pursue women's economic development. Guided by these principles, my administration launched the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiatives. The W-GDP is first-ever government-wide approach to women's economic empowerment, working to ensure that women all over the planet have the legal right to own and inherit property, work in the same industries as men, travel freely, and access credit and institutions. Yesterday, I was also pleased to host leaders for a discussion about an ironclad American commitment: protecting religious leaders and also protecting religious freedom. This fundamental right is under growing threat around the world. Hard to believe, but 80 percent of the world's population lives in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or even completely outlawed. Americans will never fire or tire in our effort to defend and promote freedom of worship and religion. We want and support religious liberty for all. Americans will also never tire of defending innocent life. We are aware that many United Nations projects have attempted to assert a global right to taxpayer-funded abortion on demand, right up until the moment of delivery. Global bureaucrats have absolutely no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life. Like many nations here today, we in America believe that every child , born and unborn , is a sacred gift from God. There is no circumstance under which the United States will allow international entries to trample on the rights of our citizens, including the right to self-defense. That is why, this year, I announced that we will never ratify the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, which would threaten the liberties of law-abiding American citizens. The United States will always uphold our constitutional right to keep and bear arms. We will always uphold our Second Amendment. The core rights and values America defends today were inscribed in America's founding documents. Our nation's Founders understood that there will always be those who believe they are entitled to wield power and control over others. Tyranny advances under many names and many theories, but it always comes down to the desire for domination. It protects not the interests of many, but the privilege of few. Our Founders gave us a system designed to restrain this dangerous impulse. They chose to entrust American power to those most invested in the fate of our nation: a proud and fiercely independent people. The true good of a nation can only be pursued by those who love it: by citizens who are rooted in its history, who are nourished by its culture, committed to its values, attached to its people, and who know that its future is theirs to build or theirs to lose. Patriots see a nation and its destiny in ways no one else can. Liberty is only preserved, sovereignty is only secured, democracy is only sustained, greatness is only realized, by the will and devotion of patriots. In their spirit is found the strength to resist oppression, the inspiration to forge legacy, the goodwill to seek friendship, and the bravery to reach for peace. Love of our nations makes the world better for all nations. So to all the leaders here today, join us in the most fulfilling mission a person could have, the most profound contribution anyone can make: Lift up your nations. Cherish your culture. Honor your histories. Treasure your citizens. Make your countries strong, and prosperous, and righteous. Honor the dignity of your people, and nothing will be outside of your reach. When our nations are greater, the future will be brighter, our people will be happier, and our partnerships will be stronger. With God's help, together we will cast off the enemies of liberty and overcome the oppressors of dignity. We will set new standards of living and reach new heights of human achievement. We will rediscover old truths, unravel old mysteries, and make thrilling new breakthroughs. And we will find more beautiful friendship and more harmony among nations than ever before. My fellow leaders, the path to peace and progress, and freedom and justice, and a better world for all humanity, begins at home. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the nations of the world. And God bless America. Thank you very much. (Applause.)"}

EDT THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. My fellow Americans, I greet you this morning from the White House to announce a major breakthrough toward achieving a better future for Syria and for the Middle East. It's been a long time. Over the last five days, you have seen that a ceasefire that we established along Syria's border has held, and it's held very well, beyond most expectations. Early this morning, the government of Turkey informed my administration that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria, and making the ceasefire permanent. And it will indeed be permanent. However you would also define the word \"permanent\" in that part of the world as somewhat questionable, we all understand that. But I do believe it will be permanent. I have therefore instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to lift all sanctions imposed on October 14th in response to Turkey's original offensive moves against the Kurds in Syria's northeast border region. So the sanctions will be lifted unless something happens that we're not happy with. This was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else, no other nation. Very simple. And we're willing to take blame, and we're also willing to take credit. This is something they've been trying to do for many, many decades. Since then, others have come out to help, and we welcome them to do so. Other countries have stepped forward, they want to help, and we think that's great. The nations in the region must ultimately take on the responsibility of helping Turkey and Syria police their border. We want other nations to get involved. We've secured the oil, and, therefore, a small number of U.S. troops will remain in the area where they have the oil. And we're going to be protecting it, and we'll be deciding what we're going to do with it in the future. In any event, by the moves that we've made, we are achieving a much more peaceful and stable area between Turkey and Syria, including a 20-mile-wide safe zone. An interesting term, \"safe zone.\" That's the term we're using it. Hopefully, that zone will become safe. Thousands and thousands of people have been killed in that zone over the years. But it's been sought for many, many decades, and I think we have something that's going to be strong and hold up. Turkey, Syria, and all forms of the Kurds, have been fighting for centuries. We have done them a great service, and we've done a great job for all of them. And now we're getting out. A long time. We were supposed to be there for 30 days; that was almost 10 years ago. So we're there for 30 days, and now we're leaving. It was supposed to be a very quick hit and let's get out. And it was a quick hit, except they stayed for almost 10 years. Let someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand. I want to thank Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo for leading the American delegation so successfully to Turkey several days ago, along with National Security Advisor O'Brien. I want to thank them very much. The American delegation negotiated the original five-day ceasefire that ended [enabled] Kurdish fighters to safely leave. It just got them to a point where, frankly, they were able. It enabled them to get out, to go and move, really, just a few miles in a slightly different direction. So this enabled them to do so. Countless lives are now being saved as a result of our negotiation with Turkey , an outcome reached without spilling one drop of American blood. No injuries. Nobody shot, nobody killed. I have just spoken to General Mazloum, a wonderful man, the Commander-in-Chief of the SDF Kurds. And he was extremely thankful for what the United States has done. Could not have been more thankful. General Mazloum has assured me that ISIS is under very, very strict lock and key, and the detention facilities are being strongly maintained. There were a few that got out , a small number, relatively speaking , and they've been largely recaptured. I'm also sure that he will be issuing his own statement very shortly. We had a great talk. But we've saved the lives of many, many Kurds. He understands that. The war was going to be vicious and probably not very long. And I'm very happy to have been involved in it, as are our Vice President, our Secretary of State, and all of the other people on our team. By getting that ceasefire to stick, we've done something that's very, very special. But by getting the ceasefire after a tremendous amount of really tough war for a very short period of days, that is something very special. Our troops are safe, and the pain and suffering of the three-day fight that occurred was directly responsible for our ability to make an agreement with Turkey and the Kurds that could never have been made without this short-term outburst. Should Turkey fail to honor its obligations, including the protection of religious and ethnic minorities , which I truly believe they will do , we reserve the right to re-impose crippling sanctions, including substantially increased tariffs on steel and all other products coming out of Turkey. We are now an economic powerhouse like never before, and, very importantly, like no other. Our economic might is stronger than it's ever been, and our competitors are not doing very well. We also expect Turkey to abide by its commitment regarding ISIS. As a backup to the Kurds watching over them, should something happen, Turkey is there to grab them. Further, we implore European countries to come and take those fighters that the U.S. captured and bring them back to their countries for incarceration and for trial. Until just recently, Europe has been very unresponsive in doing what they should have been doing for a long time. Now is their chance to finally act. American forces defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate during the last two years. We thank the Syrian Democratic Forces for their sacrifices in this effort. They've been terrific. Now Turkey, Syria, and others in the region must work to ensure that ISIS does not regain any territory. It's their neighborhood; they have to maintain it. They have to take care of it. There were some political pundits who responded to Turkey's offensive in Syria by calling for yet another American military intervention. I don't think so. But halting the incursion by military force would have required deploying tens of thousands of American troops against Turkey , a NATO Ally and a country the United States has developed a very good relationship with, including President Erdo\u011fan. The same people that I watched and read , giving me and the United States advice , were the people that I have been watching and reading for many years. They are the ones that got us into the Middle East mess but never had the vision or the courage to get us out. They just talk. How many Americans must die in the Middle East in the midst of these ancient sectarian and tribal conflicts? After all of the precious blood and treasure America has poured into the deserts of the Middle East, I am committed to pursuing a different course , one that leads to victory for America. Through much work, we have done things that everybody said couldn't be done. Today's announcement validates our course of action with Turkey that only a couple of weeks ago were scorned, and now people are saying, \"Wow. What a great outcome. Congratulations.\" It's too early to me to be congratulated, but we've done a good job. We've saved a lot of lives. Most importantly, we have avoided another costly military intervention that could've led to disastrous, far-reaching consequences. Many thousands of people could've been killed. The last administration said, \"Assad must go.\" They could've easily produced that outcome, but they didn't. In fact, they drew a very powerful red line in the sand , you all remember, the red line in the sand , when children were gassed and killed, but then did not honor their commitment as other children died in the same horrible manner. But I did honor my commitments with 58 Tomahawks. Eight long years after President Obama's ill-fated push at regime change, U.S. troops are still on the ground in Syria. More than half a million people are dead, hundreds of thousands are terribly injured, and millions more Syrians are displaced. It really is a nightmare of misery. Across the Middle East, we have seen anguish on a colossal scale. We have spent $8 trillion on wars in the Middle East, never really wanting to win those wars. But after all that money was spent and all of those lives lost, the young men and women gravely wounded , so many , the Middle East is less safe, less stable, and less secure than before these conflicts began. The same people pushing for these wars are often the ones demanding America open its doors to unlimited migration from war-torn regions, importing the terrorism and the threat of terrorism right to our own shores. But not anymore. My administration understands that immigration security is national security. As a candidate for President, I made clear that we needed a new approach to American foreign policy, one guided not by ideology, but by experience, history, and a realistic understanding of the world. We are building up America's military might like never before, investing $2.5 trillion since my election. But we will not be depleted. We will not happen again. It will not be allowed to happen again, where our military is depleted, fighting in areas of the world where we shouldn't be. When we commit American troops to battle, we must do so only when a vital national interest is at stake, and when we have a clear objective, a plan for victory, and a path out of conflict. That's what we have to have. We need a plan of victory. We will only win. Our whole basis has to be the right plan, and then we will only win. Nobody can beat us. Nobody can beat us. I want to again thank everyone on the American team who helped achieve the ceasefire in Syria, saved so many lives, along with President Erdo\u011fan of Turkey , a man I've gotten to know very well and a man who loves his country. And, in his mind, he's doing the right thing for his country, and we may be meeting in the very near future. I also want to thank General Mazloum for his understanding and for his great strength and for his incredible words today to me , but me just as a representative of the United States , because he knows that we saved tens of thousands of Kurds. And we're not talking in the long term, we're talking in the short term. We're talking something that was going on immediately and something, frankly, that was planned for a long time. The job of our military is not to police the world. Other nations must step up and do their fair share. That hasn't taken place. Today's breakthrough is a critical step in that direction. Thank you all very much, and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you. END 11:56 A.M.

EST THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much, Stanley. And thank you for your tremendous support of this wonderful parade. Today, we come together as one nation to salute the veterans of the United States Armed Forces , the greatest warriors to ever walk the face of the Earth. Our veterans risked everything for us. Now it is our duty to serve and protect them every single day of our lives. It is truly an honor to come back to New York City, right here in Madison Square Park, to be the first President ever to attend \"America's Parade.\" (Applause.) To every veteran here with us, to the thousands preparing to march on 5th Avenue , it'll be really something , and to the 18 million veterans across our country: The First Lady and I have come to express the everlasting love and loyalty of 327 million Americans. I want to recognize Department of Veterans Affairs Deputy Secretary James Byrne for joining us. Thank you, James. Thank you, James. (Applause.) Great job. I'm pleased to report that our administration and all of the work that we've done , the veteran satisfaction with the VA is at 90 percent. It's the highest rate ever recorded in the history of this particular program. And that's awfully good, and we're very proud of you and the Secretary. Thank you very much. Great job. (Applause.) Also with us is New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. (Applause.) Along with many other distinguished guests. Thanks as well to everyone at the United War Veterans Council for putting on this incredible event, including Bill White, Doug McGowan, and a very special acknowledgement to someone who has devoted his life to this parade: Marine Vietnam veteran Vince McGowan. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, each of you, and all of the supporters whose generosity make this parade possible. Tremendous amounts of work has been done, and tremendous, frankly, amounts of money has been donated. And we appreciate it, and we appreciate Stanley. We're very glad to be joined as well by the Honorary Grand Marshal of the Parade, Marine Corps Commandant General David Berger and the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Troy Black. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Let us also show our profound appreciation to the 2019 grand marshals of the parade who have served in World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, and Iraq. This morning, as more than 30,000 patriotic Americans line the streets of Manhattan, we carry on a noble tradition that began one century ago. In 1919, the people of this city filled block after block to welcome home General Pershing and his 25,000 American soldiers after victory in World War One. Just a few years before, many of those soldiers had boarded ships not far from here at Hoboken Port. More than 4 million Americans fought in the Great War, and more than 116,000 made the ultimate sacrifice. At the 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the 11th month, in 1918, the Armistice was declared, the war had come to an end, and the Allies achieved a great, great victory.Every year since, on November 11th, we have shared our nation's deepest praise and gratitude to every citizen who has worn the uniform of the American Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Marines. We are profoundly moved to have with us veterans of World War Two, including one of the grand marshals, Woody Williams. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Woody. Thank you very much, Woody. To each veteran of the war: The glory of your deeds will only grow greater with time. This city is graced by your presence. This nation is forever in your debt. And we thank you all.We're also pleased to be joined by veterans of the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the War on Terror. You are the reason our hearts swell with pride, our foes tremble with fear, and our nation thrives in freedom. Would you please stand so that we can honor your heroic service? Please. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you all.Each year, this parade highlights one branch of our military. This year, we honor the elite masters of air, land, and sea , the legendary Leathernecks, the feared Devil Dogs, the \"first to flight [fight]\": the United States Marines. Let's hear it. (Applause.) That's great. Yesterday, we celebrated the Marines' 244th birthday. That's pretty good. (Applause.) The Few and the Proud are always faithful, and they always win. I also want to thank the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation, which provides scholarships to children of our fallen heroes. To every Gold Star Family: We will stand by your side forever.It is very fitting that the Veterans Day Parade begin right here in New York City. Since the earliest days of our nation, New York has exemplified the American spirit and has been at the heart of our nation's story of daring and defiance. On July 2nd, 1776, the British Armada sailed into New York Harbor, numbering more than 400 ships and carrying more than 30,000 men. The British came here to snuff out what they thought was just a minor American Revolution. Didn't turn out to be that way. But the Redcoats did know , what they did know was they were going to have a problem, but they didn't know that New York would meet them with the fearsome power of American patriots. In World War One, New York regiments like \"Harlem Hellfighters,\" the \"Lost Battalion,\" and \"the Fighting 69th\" were revered all over the globe. During World War Two, 63 million tons of supplies and more than 3 million service members shipped out of New York Harbor.On September 11, 2001, the whole world saw the horror and responded to America's wicked enemies with unwaving [unwavering] courage, unbreakable spirit and resolve that is deeper than oceans, fiercer than fires, and stronger than steel. Last week, I was honored to award the Presidential Citizens Medal to an extraordinary American: Rick Rescorla. Rick enlisted in the Army at the recruiting center in Times Square, became a great war hero in Vietnam, and then became head of security at Morgan Stanley in the World Trade Center. On September 11th, he saved 2,700 lives before giving his own. Today, we are immensely grateful to be joined by Rick's son, Trevor. Thank you, Trevor. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you. To Trevor and every 9\/11 family, we pledge to never, ever forget.The towering spirit of strength that we see in this city lives within the heart of every American warrior. From the snow of Valley Forge to the jungles of Vietnam, from the forests of Belleau Wood to the beaches of Normandy, from the mountains of Afghanistan to the deserts of Iraq, that spirit has helped our fighters defeat tyrants, conquer fascism, vanquish communism, and face down terrorism. Just a few weeks ago, American Special Forces raided the ISIS compound and brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice. Thanks to American warriors, al-Baghdadi is dead , (applause) , his second in charge is dead, we have our eyes on number three, his reign of terror is over, and our enemies are running very, very scared. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Those who threaten our people don't stand a chance against the righteous might of the American military.In a few weeks, we will mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge , our nation's bloodiest battle of World War Two. More than 47,000 Americans were wounded, and 19,000 gave their last breath for their country. We are proudly joined today by a veteran of the Battle of the Bulge, a native New Yorker who is 94 years old and still going very, very strong: Corporal Jack Foy. (Applause.) You look good, Jack. You look good. Jack enlisted in the Army right out of high school. He fought through brutal months of the campaign in northern France. On Christmas Eve, after marching nearly 100 miles in the snow in sub-zero temperatures, he arrived outside the town of Bastogne in Belgium. For two weeks, Jack fought under ceaseless artillery fire and helped push the enemy back from a critical road. At one point, a mine blew up and it destroyed his vehicle, badly hurting many. He was wounded three times, but he kept on fighting.After the Allied victory at the Battle of the Bulge, Jack fought for the remaining nine months of the war , across the Siegfried line, up the Moselle River, through the Rhineland, and all the way across Germany until he reached the gates of Ohrdruf concentration camp, the first Nazi camp to be liberated. That was number one. That was a big, big event.As Jack has said about the Battle of the Bulge, \"When the chips were down and the situation was desperate, the American soldiers stood up to be counted. For a brief moment in history, these men held our nation's destiny in their hands. We did not fail.\" Thank you very much, Jack. (Applause.) Great. And, Corporal Foy, we will forever be proud of what you and your fellow soldiers achieved for all of humanity.Also here with us today is Lauren Mathews, the granddaughter of a Battle of the Bulge veteran who has since passed away. His name was Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds. Like so many of our veterans, Roddie never talked about the war. Lauren never knew her grandfather's story until she embarked upon a school project about 10 years ago. Roddie was in the 422nd regiment, which was overwhelmed when the Nazis launched their surprise assault. He and his men fought for three treacherous days before being taken as prisoners of war.After they arrived at a prison camp, the German commander sent an order over the loud speaker. The Jewish-American soldiers were all told to step out of line during the roll call the next day. Knowing the terrible fate that would come to his Jewish comrades, Roddie immediately said, \"We're not doing that.\" He sent orders to have every American step out of line with their Jewish brothers-in-arms. The next morning, 1,292 Americans stepped forward. The German commander stormed over to Roddie and said, \"They cannot all be Jews.\" Roddie stared right back; he said, \"We are all Jews here.\" At that point, the German put a gun to Roddie's head and demanded, \"You will order the Jews to step forward immediately or I will shoot you right now through the head.\" Roddie responded, \"Major, you can shoot me, but you'll have to kill us all.\" That's something. (Applause.) The German turned red, got very angry, but put down his gun, and walked away. Master Sergeant Edmonds saved 200 Jewish-Americans , soldiers that day. So proud to be Jewish and so proud of our country. Lauren, thank you for being here today as we remember your grandfather's unbelievable and exceptional valor. Lauren, please stand up. Thank you very much. (Applause.) One of the 200 Jewish-American soldiers who was saved that fateful day is Staff Sergeant Lester Tanner. Lester is now 96 years old , (applause) , and he joins us here. Boy, you guys are looking very good. Ninety-six. Lester , you're really 96, Lester? I don't believe it. You're looking good. Thank you very much. Thank you also for your very noble service and for sharing this incredible story with the world. Thank you very much, Lester. The men and women who have donned our nation's uniforms are the bravest, toughest, strongest, and most virtuous warriors ever to walk on Earth. You left your families and fought in faraway lands. You came face-to-face with evil and you did not back down. You returned home from war, and you never forgot your friends who didn't return, including prisoners of war and those missing in action.Every day, you think of them and pray for them. But your greatest tribute of all is the way you lived your lives in the years since. You raised your families, you endured the wounds of war, and you endured the pains of that memory. Yet, you keep going, you keep serving, you keep giving, and you keep loving. You volunteer at your local veterans post, and you keep in touch with your battle comrades. You support our Gold Star Families, you take care of our wounded warriors, and you stand alongside of our service members when they return from war. On Veterans Day, our nation rededicates itself to our most solemn duty. While we can never repay our warriors for their boundless service and sacrifice, we must uphold with supreme vigilance our sacred obligation to \"care for those who have borne the battle.\" In just a minute, we will have a moment of silence and we will lay a wreath at the Eternal Light Monument. As we do, with God as our witness, we pledge to always honor our veterans and pay immortal tribute to those who have laid down their lives so that we might be free. Together, we must safeguard what generations of fearless patriots gave everything to secure. We will protect our liberty, uphold our values, and defend our home. We will ensure that righteous legacy of America's veterans stands as a testament to this nation from now until the end of time.To every veteran here today and all across our land: You are America's greatest living heroes and we will cherish you now, always, and forever. Thank you. God bless our veterans. And God bless America. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. END 10:51 A.M.

And thank you for your tremendous support of this wonderful parade. Today, we come together as one nation to salute the veterans of the United States Armed Forces , the greatest warriors to ever walk the face of the Earth. Our veterans risked everything for us. Now it is our duty to serve and protect them every single day of our lives. It is truly an honor to come back to New York City, right here in Madison Square Park, to be the first President ever to attend 'America's Parade.' (Applause.) To every veteran here with us, to the thousands preparing to march on 5th Avenue , it'll be really something , and to the 18 million veterans across our country: The First Lady and I have come to express the everlasting love and loyalty of 327 million Americans. I want to recognize Department of Veterans Affairs Deputy Secretary James Byrne for joining us. Thank you, James. Thank you, James. (Applause.) Great job. I'm pleased to report that our administration and all of the work that we've done , the veteran satisfaction with the VA is at 90 percent. It's the highest rate ever recorded in the history of this particular program. And that's awfully good, and we're very proud of you and the Secretary. Thank you very much. Great job. (Applause.) Also with us is New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. (Applause.) Along with many other distinguished guests. Thanks as well to everyone at the United War Veterans Council for putting on this incredible event, including Bill White, Doug McGowan, and a very special acknowledgement to someone who has devoted his life to this parade: Marine Vietnam veteran Vince McGowan. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, each of you, and all of the supporters whose generosity make this parade possible. Tremendous amounts of work has been done, and tremendous, frankly, amounts of money has been donated. And we appreciate it, and we appreciate Stanley. We're very glad to be joined as well by the Honorary Grand Marshal of the Parade, Marine Corps Commandant General David Berger and the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Troy Black. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Let us also show our profound appreciation to the 2019 grand marshals of the parade who have served in World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, and Iraq. This morning, as more than 30,000 patriotic Americans line the streets of Manhattan, we carry on a noble tradition that began one century ago. In 1919, the people of this city filled block after block to welcome home General Pershing and his 25,000 American soldiers after victory in World War One. Just a few years before, many of those soldiers had boarded ships not far from here at Hoboken Port. More than 4 million Americans fought in the Great War, and more than 116,000 made the ultimate sacrifice. At the 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the 11th month, in 1918, the Armistice was declared, the war had come to an end, and the Allies achieved a great, great victory.Every year since, on November 11th, we have shared our nation's deepest praise and gratitude to every citizen who has worn the uniform of the American Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Marines. We are profoundly moved to have with us veterans of World War Two, including one of the grand marshals, Woody Williams. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Woody. Thank you very much, Woody. To each veteran of the war: The glory of your deeds will only grow greater with time. This city is graced by your presence. This nation is forever in your debt. And we thank you all.We're also pleased to be joined by veterans of the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the War on Terror.

This year, we honor the elite masters of air, land, and sea , the legendary Leathernecks, the feared Devil Dogs, the 'first to flight ': the United States Marines. Let's hear it. (Applause.) That's great. Yesterday, we celebrated the Marines' 244th birthday. That's pretty good. (Applause.) The Few and the Proud are always faithful, and they always win.

President Obama and the Obama Administration were unable to get this done. I got it done. I wish to thank the leaders who helped pass this legislation: Secretary Betsy DeVos and Secretary Steven Mnuchin, along with Senator Lamar Alexander, Senator Tim Scott, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, Representative Virginia Foxx, and Representative Mark Walker. Thanks also to United Negro College Fund President and Chief Executive Officer Michael Lomax, Thurgood Marshall College Fund President and Chief Executive Officer Harry Williams, and National Association for Equal Opportunity President and Chief Executive Officer Lezli Baskerville. When I took office, I promised to fight for HBCUs, and my Administration continues to deliver. A few months ago, funding for HBCUs was in jeopardy. But the White House and Congress came together and reached a historic agreement. For the first time ever, I signed legislation to permanently fund HBCUs and other institutions that primarily serve first-generation and minority students. This action guarantees more than $2.5 billion over the next 10 years, including $850 million specifically for HBCUs. Today's achievement continues my unprecedented commitment to HBCUs. During my first weeks in office, I moved the HBCU initiative, led by Johnathan Holifield, to the White House and worked with Congress to increase funding for HBCUs by more than $100 million. HBCUs have never had better champions in the White House. The bill I signed today also reforms the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. The Internal Revenue Service will now seamlessly transfer applicants' records to the Department of Education, so that families can use a simpler, shorter application for financial aid and those with student loans do not have to complete a cumbersome income certification process year after year. This is a transformative change that has been talked about in Washington for more than a decade, but everyone always said it could not be done. We got it done.

Others provisions (such as Division A, sections 8075, 8078, 8110, 9013, and 9016) purport to require advance notice to the Congress before the President may direct certain military actions or provide certain forms of military assistance.In addition, Division C, section 534 and Division D, section 516 of the Act restricts transfers of detainees held at United States Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. I fully intend to keep that detention facility open and to use it, as necessary or appropriate, for detention operations. Consistent with the statements I have issued in signing other bills, my Administration will treat these, and similar provisions, in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. I also reiterate the longstanding understanding of the executive branch that requirements of advance notice regarding military or diplomatic actions encompass only actions for which providing advance notice is feasible and consistent with the President's constitutional authority and duty as Commander in Chief to ensure national security. Certain provisions of the Act (such as Division B, sections 509, 516, and 526; Division D, section 523) could, in certain circumstances, interfere with the exercise of the President's constitutional authority to conduct diplomacy. My Administration will treat each of these provisions consistent with the President's constitutional authorities with respect to foreign relations, including the President's role as the sole representative of the Nation in foreign affairs. Division B, section 531 of the Act provides that the Department of Justice may not use any funds made available under this Act to prevent implementation of medical marijuana laws by various States and territories. My Administration will treat this provision consistent with the President's constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute the laws of the United States. Certain provisions of the Act within Division D, title II, under the heading \"Office of Management and Budget, Salaries and Expenses,\" impose restrictions on supervision by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of work performed by executive departments and agencies, including provisos that no funds made available to OMB \"may be expended for the altering of the annual work plan developed by the Corps of Engineers for submission to the Committees on Appropriations\"; that \"none of the funds provided in this or prior Acts shall be used, directly or indirectly, by the Office of Management and Budget, for evaluating or determining if water resource project or study reports submitted by the Chief of Engineers acting through the Secretary of the Army are in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and requirements relevant to the Civil Works water resource planning process\"; and that \"none of the funds appropriated in this Act for the Office of Management and Budget may be used for the purpose of reviewing any agricultural marketing orders or any activities or regulations under the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (7 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).\" The President has well-established authority to supervise and oversee the executive branch and to rely on subordinates, including aides within the Executive Office of the President, to assist in the exercise of that authority. Legislation that significantly impedes the President's ability to supervise the executive branch or obtain the assistance of aides in this function violates the separation of powers by undermining the President's ability to fulfill his constitutional responsibilities, including the responsibility to faithfully execute the laws of the United States. My Administration will, therefore, treat these restrictions consistent with these Presidential duties. Certain provisions of the Act (such as Division C, sections 713 and 743) purport to prohibit the use of appropriations to supervise communications by employees of the executive branch to the Congress and to Inspectors General. Other provisions (such as Division C, section 616) purport to prohibit the use of funds to deny an Inspector General access to agency records or documents. My Administration will treat these provisions in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to control the disclosure of information that could impair foreign relations, national security, law enforcement, the deliberative processes of the executive branch, or the performance of the President's constitutional duties, and to supervise communications by Federal officers and employees related to their official duties, including in cases where such communications would be unlawful or could reveal confidential information protected by executive privilege. In addition, certain provisions of the Act (such as Division B, section 112) purport to mandate or regulate the dissemination of information that may be protected by executive privilege. My Administration will treat these provisions consistent with the President's constitutional authority to control information, the disclosure of which could impair national security, foreign relations, the deliberative processes of the executive branch, or the performance of the President's constitutional duties. Certain provisions of the Act (such as Division D, section 536) purport to require recommendations regarding legislation to the Congress. Because the Constitution gives the President the authority to recommend only \"such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient,\" my Administration will continue the practice of treating provisions like these as advisory and non\u2011binding. Certain provisions of the Act (such as Division C, sections 101, 112, 113, 116, 117, 201, 541, 608, 609, 717, 730, 803(a), and 815) purport to condition the authority of officers to spend or reallocate funds on the approval of one or more congressional committees. These are impermissible forms of congressional aggrandizement in the execution of the laws other than by the enactment of statutes. My Administration will make appropriate efforts to notify the relevant committees before taking the specified actions and will accord the recommendations of such committees all appropriate and serious consideration, but it will not treat spending decisions as dependent on the approval or prior consultation with congressional committees.

{"SpeechID":"VSDT20122019240","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2019-12-20","SpeechTitle":"Statement by the President","Type":"statement","RawText":"Today, I have signed into law S. 1790, the \"National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020\" (the \"Act\"). The Act authorizes fiscal year 2020 appropriations for Department of Defense (DOD) national security programs, provides vital equipment modernization for our military branches, a well\u2011deserved pay raise for our service members, 12 weeks of paid parental leave to all Federal civilian employees, and, most significantly, authorizes the creation of the 6th Branch of the Armed Services, the United States Space Force as an Armed Force within the Department of the Air Force. I applaud both the Senate and House Armed Services Committees for their work on the bill and the leadership of both chambers for securing its passage. I note, however, that the Act includes several provisions that raise constitutional concerns.Several provisions of the Act, including sections 1254, 1273, 1698(a), and 2810, purport to restrict the President's authority to manage personnel, materiel, and logistical matters in the manner the President believes to be necessary or advisable for the successful conduct of military missions and foreign affairs. While I share the objectives of the Congress with respect to maintaining the strength and security of the United States, my Administration will implement these provisions consistent with the President's authority as Commander in Chief and as the sole representative of the Nation in foreign affairs. Other provisions of the Act, including sections 1216, 1231, 1234(a), 1242, 1258(a), 2863(a)(2), 3534, 3541, 3543(d), 3551(c)(6), (8), and (11), 6701, 7124, 7125, 7402, 7412(b)(1)(B), and 7426, purport to dictate the position of the United States in external military and foreign affairs. My Administration will treat these provisions consistent with the President's exclusive constitutional authorities as Commander in Chief and as the sole representative of the Nation in foreign affairs, including the authorities to determine the terms upon which recognition is given to foreign sovereigns, to receive foreign representatives, and to conduct the Nation's diplomacy. Some provisions of the Act in particular, including sections 1222(a), 1234(a), 1237(b), 1686(a), and 6704, purport to require that the Congress receive a certification, notification, or report before the President directs certain military or diplomatic actions. Section 1234(a) of the Act, for example, purports to require congressional notification before providing Russia with a notice of intent to withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty. I reiterate the longstanding understanding of the executive branch that these types of provisions encompass only actions for which such advance certification or notification is feasible and consistent with the President's exclusive constitutional authorities as Commander in Chief and as the sole representative of the Nation in foreign affairs. I note also the understanding of the executive branch that the definition of the \"exclusive economic zone\" in section 3532(3) of the Act is provided for purposes of the Maritime SAFE Act only (Division C, title 35, subtitle C) and does not purport to alter the definition of the United States' exclusive economic zone for all other purposes, including those set forth in Department of State Public Notice 2237 published in the Federal Register, Vol. 60, No. 163, August 23, 1995, pages 43,825-43,829. Sections 1042 and 1043 of the Act purport to restrict transfers of detainees held at United States Naval Station, Guant\u00e1namo Bay. I fully intend to keep that detention facility open and to use it, as necessary or appropriate, for detention operations. Consistent with the statements I have issued in signing previous National Defense Authorization Acts, I reiterate the longstanding position of the executive branch that, under certain circumstances, restrictions on the President's authority to transfer detainees violates constitutional separation-of-powers principles, including the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. Other provisions of the Act present concerns under the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the separation of powers. First, section 953(b)(1) of the Act provides that the incumbent Commander of the Air Force Space Command (Commander\/AFSC) may serve in the new office of Chief of Space Operations (CSO) for a term of 4 years without another appointment by the President that would be subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. This provision would raise Appointments Clause concerns if understood to allow the incumbent Commander\/AFSC to accede automatically to the new office. My Administration will therefore construe section 953(b) to require either the President alone or the Secretary of Defense to appoint the Commander\/AFSC as CSO. Although my Administration believes the Congress should continue to require that permanent leaders of each Armed Force be presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed, we respect the Congress's decision to permit appointment of the CSO by a constitutional alternative method during this transitional period. Additionally, for a 1-year period following enactment of the Act, section 953(b)(2) would authorize the Secretary of Defense to permit the CSO to serve concurrently as the Commander of the United States Space Command (Commander\/USSC) without further appointment. The Secretary's exercise of that authority could displace the incumbent Commander\/AFSC, however, who currently serves as Commander\/USSC pursuant to an appointment by the President, with Senate confirmation, and who is thus removable only by the President. My Administration will apply section 953(b)(2) consistent with the President's removal authority over officials who exercise executive authority. Second, section 509(a) of the Act purports to condition the authority of the Secretary of Defense to increase the retired grade of a military officer on the advice and consent of the Senate. As applied to any retired military officer, living or dead, this provision violates the separation of powers by giving the Senate a role in an executive decision that the Constitution does not explicitly allocate to the Senate. My Administration will accordingly treat the purported requirement of Senate confirmation as ineffective. Third, section 6306 of the Act requires the Director of National Intelligence to establish a \"Supply Chain and Counterintelligence Task Force\" responsible for standardizing the sharing of national security information within the executive branch. The Task Force will consist of representatives of various agencies, but section 6306 does not specify the manner of their selection. To avoid Appointments Clause concerns, my Administration will construe this provision as providing for the Director of National Intelligence, a department head, to approve selections to the Task Force. Fourth, similar to section 739 of the Act of last year's National Defense Authorization Act, section 733 deepens existing violations of the Appointments Clause, the Incompatibility Clause, and the separation of powers contained within the statute establishing the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine. I reiterate the statement I provided on August 13, 2018, regarding the parallel provision in the 2019 Act. Fifth, section 3203 of the Act imposes a deadline on the President's nomination of a new member to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board for Senate confirmation. If the President misses the deadline, the provision requires periodic reports to the Senate explaining why and setting forth a plan to expedite the nomination. This interference with the President's determination regarding whom to nominate for an office exceeds Congress's permissible role under the Appointments Clause. I will continue to strive to nominate officers for Senate confirmation in a timely fashion but will treat section 3203 as advisory. Sixth, section 1034(a) of the Act, authorizing the designation of a Senior Technical Authority for each naval vessel class, may allow the exercise of significant governmental authority by a person not appointed as an officer. To comply with the Appointments Clause, my Administration will ensure that an individual serves as a Senior Technical Authority only with the approval of the Secretary of Defense. Seventh, several provisions, including sections 1639, 1735, 1738, 6741, and 7221 of the Act, purport to establish, reauthorize or add to the authorities of hybrid commissions or boards comprising both executive branch and legislative branch appointees. Because these commissions include members appointed by the legislative branch, under the separation of powers they cannot be executive branch entities, which must be subject to the supervision of the President under Article II. My Administration, accordingly, will treat the commissions as legislative branch entities, separate from the executive branch. The executive branch members of these Commissions will remain accountable to the President in the exercise of their statutory responsibilities. A number of provisions of the Act, including sections 1236(b)(5), 1261, 1264, 1277, 1285, 1644, 1650, 1686(b), 1691, 1711, 1722, 1744, 1753(a)(3), 3134(b)(2)(A), 3202(c), 5102(b), 5501, 3554(b)(1)(A) and (c)(1), 5502(b), 5511, 5502(b)(3), (4), 5709(a) and (c), 5713, 5714, 5715, 5721, 5722(d)(1), 5304(b), 5602(b)(3), (4) and (c)(1), 6310(a), 6315(b)(1), 6507(c)(1)(B), 6603(b), 6604(a) and (b), 6705, 6716, 6718(a), 6719, 6729(b), 6741, and 7221(e), purport to mandate or regulate the dissemination of information that may be protected by executive privilege, including by interfering with Presidential control of the process for making a determination that information is protected. My Administration will treat these provisions consistent with the President's constitutional authority to control information, the disclosure of which could impair national security, foreign relations, law enforcement, or the performance of the President's constitutional duties. A number of other provisions of the Act, including sections 231(e)(2), 739(g)(2)(B)(v), 800(f)(2)(D), 1246(b)(5), 1260C(b)(2)(B), 1260E(b)(6), 5705, 6712(c)(1)(B), 6728(4), and 7145(2), purport to require the President or executive branch officials under the President's supervision to recommend certain legislative measures to the Congress. My Administration will treat these provisions consistent with Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, which provides the President the discretion to recommend to the Congress only \"such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\" Finally, section 633(c) of the Act purports to condition the authority of the Secretary of Defense to consolidate military exchanges and commissaries on notification by the Committees on Armed Services of both houses that they have received and accepted a Comptroller General report. This condition is an impermissible form of congressional aggrandizement in the execution of the laws other than by the enactment of a statute. Out of a spirit of comity, my Administration will wait a reasonable period of time to receive this notification but is not legally bound to do so. DONALD J.

My Administration will treat these provisions consistent with the President's constitutional authority to control information, the disclosure of which could impair national security, foreign relations, law enforcement, or the performance of the President's constitutional duties. A number of other provisions of the Act, including sections 231(e)(2), 739(g)(2)(B)(v), 800(f)(2)(D), 1246(b)(5), 1260C(b)(2)(B), 1260E(b)(6), 5705, 6712(c)(1)(B), 6728(4), and 7145(2), purport to require the President or executive branch officials under the President's supervision to recommend certain legislative measures to the Congress. My Administration will treat these provisions consistent with Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, which provides the President the discretion to recommend to the Congress only 'such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.' Finally, section 633(c) of the Act purports to condition the authority of the Secretary of Defense to consolidate military exchanges and commissaries on notification by the Committees on Armed Services of both houses that they have received and accepted a Comptroller General report. This condition is an impermissible form of congressional aggrandizement in the execution of the laws other than by the enactment of a statute. Out of a spirit of comity, my Administration will wait a reasonable period of time to receive this notification but is not legally bound to do so"}

EST THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. And, thank you, Melania. And hello, Joint Base Andrews , special place. At ease. We have good news for you. On behalf of the First Lady, Vice President Mike Pence, Mrs. Pence, I want to wish everybody a very merry Christmas, happy New Year. This is a truly historic day for the American Armed Forces. In just a few minutes, I will proudly sign into law the largest-ever investment in the United States military. In fact, I can say: the largest ever, by far. Today also marks another landmark achievement, as we officially inaugurate the newest branch of our military. This is a very big and important moment. It's called the Space Force. (Applause.) Most importantly, we are supporting you , the heroes who defend our families, secure our nation, and protect our freedom.The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act is about making sure our warfighters have the tools, resources, and equipment you need to fight and to win , all the time, to win. We're making our military stronger and more powerful than ever before. We're joined today by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and our service Secretaries. General Mark Milley , thank you very much, General. Fantastic job you're doing. And members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; many distinguished military leaders; and Representatives Mac Thornberry, Joe Wilson, Mike Rogers, Michael Turner, Michael McCaul, Robert Wittman, French Hill, Matt Gaetz, Greg Pence, and Michael Waltz. And I want to give a special shout out to a very great gentleman who loves the military, loves this country: Senator Jim Inhofe. He's worked so hard on this. (Applause.) Thank you, Jim. Thank you all. I want to extend a special thanks to Commander of the Air Force District of Washington, Major General Ricky Rupp , (applause) , and Commander of the 11th Wing and Joint Base Andrews, Colonel Andrew Purath. Thank you, (inaudible). (Applause.) And I am profoundly grateful to everyone at America's Airfield. That's what they call it: America's Airfield. I use it often. (Laughter.) There is no greater honor than to serve as your Commander-in-Chief. I especially want to thank the incredible people who fly and maintain Air Force One. You are the best of the best. Thank you very much for doing such an incredible job. (Applause.) Today's signing of the 2020 NDAA is a watershed event in the truest sense of the word. Before I came into office, the military endured deep and devastating budget cuts. Our military, quite frankly, was very depleted. As a candidate for President, I promised to reverse these crippling cuts, and to ensure our military remains unchallenged and unrivaled anywhere in the world. And, right now, there is no one , there is no country that comes even close. (Applause.) The law I am signing today provides $738 billion , that's with a \"B.\" Seven hundred and thirty-eight billion dollars in defense funding for the 2020. That's an all-time record. In the history of our country, that's the highest amount we've ever spent on our military. And that's after $700 billion in my first year, and $716 billion last year. And it's all made, right here, in the USA. That's very important. (Applause.) And I have to say that we make the finest equipment, the finest planes, finest missiles, the finest ships. We make the finest equipment anywhere in the world. It's not even close. This brings our total investment in national defense, since my inauguration, to almost two and a half trillion dollars. And what's the good of a budget if you don't have the best military in the world? And, now, we focus on the budget a little bit. Is that okay? We'll focus on the budget. Two and a half trillion dollars. So, that's really something. And it's new, and it's beautiful, and within the next 12 months you'll have most of it. In addition to massive acquisitions, in the past two years, this bill authorizes nearly 100 new F-35s; 24 brand-new F\/A-18s; 155 Army helicopters, of all different types; 165 brand-new, beautiful Abrams tanks, said to be the best in the world; more than 50 Paladin howitzers; 2 new Virginia-class submarines; 3 new Arleigh Burke destroyers; a Ford-Class aircraft carrier, and two others on their way; and much, much more. But as we discussed earlier, our military is getting far more than just new equipment. For this first time , and I have to say, you know what happened last year? It was a good pay raise, but now you're getting another pay raise. And this will be the largest pay raise in more than 10 years , more than a decade. So, if you don't want it, you don't have to take it. (Applause.) For the first time since President Harry Truman created the Air Force over 70 years ago , think of that , we will create a brand-new American military service. That's such a momentous statement: 70 years ago, the Air Force. With my signature today, you will witness the birth of the Space Force, and that will be now officially the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces. That is something really incredible. (Applause.) It's a big moment. That's a big moment, and we're all here for it. Space. Going to be a lot of things happening in space. Because space is the world's newest warfighting domain. Amid grave threats to our national security, American superiority in space is absolutely vital. And we're leading, but we're not leading by enough. But very shortly, we'll be leading by a lot.The Space Force will help us deter aggression and control the ultimate high ground. I particularly want to thank Vice President Mike Pence. He was so involved in this with me. This was a , a real , we had the spirit, the love that , I think we can say, Mike, that we both had for this project. Because we realized how important it is to our military, to our future, to our defense , so important. And it's going to blend in magnificently with everything else that we have. So, I want to thank Mike Pence. Mike, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Great job, Mike. (Applause.) It was nearly half a century from Kitty Hawk to the creation of the Air Force. And now it's 50 years after Apollo 11 that we create the Space Force. With today's signing, I will proudly appoint General Jay Raymond the first Chief of Space Operations. And he will become the very first member of the Space Force. And he will be on the Joint Chiefs. He will be on the Joint Chiefs, which we're now expanding by one position. That's a very powerful position. So, General Raymond, congratulations, and thank you for you everything you've done. (Applause.) The 2020 NDA[A} also protects the vital legal tools we need to defend America's borders. The law improves education, childcare, and private housing for military families, and it ends the so-called \"widow's tax,\" which blocked benefits for families of fallen heroes. The tax is gone. (Applause.) It was very important. That was very important to us. The \"widow's tax\" is gone. After years of unrealized promises by other politicians, I honor my commitment today as I sign paid parental leave , (applause) , for the federal civilian workforce. That's paid, into law. So thank you very much. That's a very big thing: paid parental leave. Another thing that they've been trying to get for many years. As we head into Christmas, I am proud to report that we are giving every soldier, sailor, airman, Coast Guardsman, and Marine a well-earned pay raise. In January, each of you will see the largest increase that you have had in such a long time. In fact, it goes back so far that a lot of people don't even know what that day it is. I can just tell you: It's a lot of money. And I say it, and I say it again;: If you'd like not to take it, if you'd like to make a donation to your great country, please just let us know. We'll give you a little bit less. (Laughter.) Any takers, by the way? I don't know. No, congratulations on that. With this legislation, we show our undying commitment to the warriors who keep us safe. These are incredible warriors. These are brave, powerful warriors. And now they have the best equipment anywhere in the world and it's not even close. Just weeks ago, U.S. Special Forces brought the world's most-wanted terrorist to justice. The monstrous animal known as al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of ISIS, is dead. And his second was just given the post of being in charge, and he is also dead. (Applause.) Within three years of record military investment, our country has rejected a future of American decline and embraced our destiny of American dominance. Our military is now dominant , far ahead of any of our competitors. And if you saw where we started from, not so long ago, you'd really be amazed. I want to thank everybody, but I want to also thank those great companies that really designed , made this equipment. Because I have seen it and I've seen much of it in action, and I've, frankly, never seen anything like it in my life. So I just want to congratulate you all. Because together, we're protecting our people, our values, our traditions, and our glorious American Flag. (Applause.) I want to just end by wishing our armed forces , our great people , a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. God bless you. God bless our military. And God bless America. God bless America. (Applause.) So it's now my honor to sign the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act into law. And again, congratulations. Thank you all very much. Very, very special people. Thank you very much. (Applause.) This is the thickness. Can you believe that? (Laughter.) (The act is signed.) It's now signed. (Applause.) END 8:07 P.M.

NEPA's enactment was the culmination of legislative efforts to establish a national environmental policy and incorporate the consideration of environmental issues into the Federal Government's decision-making processes. Today, on the 50th anniversary of this milestone legislation, we take the opportunity to reflect upon NEPA's goals of protecting our Nation's natural resources and recommit to ensuring a safe, healthy, and productive environment for all Americans. From commuting to work or school and turning on lights at home to having access to clean, reliable drinking water, the daily activities of all of our citizenry are affected by NEPA's requirements. Many projects involving the construction of roads, bridges, highways, airports, transmission lines, conventional and renewable energy projects, broadband deployment, and water infrastructure, as well as management activities on public lands, such as grazing, forest management, wildfire protection, and environmental restoration projects, must undergo Federal environmental review before they can proceed. While the goals of NEPA remain the same as they did 50 years ago, the environmental review process designed to improve decision making has become increasingly complex and difficult to navigate. Project sponsors and ordinary Americans seeking decisions on permits from the Federal Government can face significant uncertainty and delays that can increase costs, derail important projects, and threaten jobs for American workers and labor union members. To improve Federal agency coordination and make environmental reviews and permitting processes far less time-consuming, I directed Federal agencies to implement a One Federal Decision policy for major infrastructure projects. Under this policy, agencies are working to complete environmental reviews within 2 years. Additionally, I directed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to modernize the Federal environmental review and decision-making process. As a result, CEQ has conducted a thorough review of its NEPA implementing regulations and will soon issue a proposal to update those regulations to address the many concerns my Administration has heard from hardworking Americans, small businesses, and State and local officials. Moreover, my Administration is delivering on my promise to continue cutting burdensome regulations and has issued almost eight deregulatory actions for every one new regulation imposed over the past 3 years, helping unleash the full potential of America's economy. My Administration remains committed to improving the environmental review and permitting process while ensuring environmental protection. This will benefit our economy and environment while also enhancing the quality of life for current and future generations of Americans. Today, we celebrate NEPA's 50th anniversary and its role in protecting our environment as we look forward to improving its implementation for the 21st century.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1392500\/presidential-message-on-the-50th-anniversary-of-the-national-environmental-policy-act&speechType=1","Summary":"Infrastructure Arts, Entertainment, and History","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/presidential-message-50th-anniversary-national-environmental-policy-act\/","CleanText":"Signed into law on January 1, 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires Federal agencies to consider and inform the public of the environmental effects of proposed major Federal actions.

As a result, CEQ has conducted a thorough review of its NEPA implementing regulations and will soon issue a proposal to update those regulations to address the many concerns my Administration has heard from hardworking Americans, small businesses, and State and local officials. Moreover, my Administration is delivering on my promise to continue cutting burdensome regulations and has issued almost eight deregulatory actions for every one new regulation imposed over the past 3 years, helping unleash the full potential of America's economy. My Administration remains committed to improving the environmental review and permitting process while ensuring environmental protection. This will benefit our economy and environment while also enhancing the quality of life for current and future generations of Americans. Today, we celebrate NEPA's 50th anniversary and its role in protecting our environment as we look forward to improving its implementation for the 21st century."}

EST THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. Well, thank you very much. And good afternoon. As President, my highest and most solemn duty is the defense of our nation and its citizens. Last night, at my direction, the United States military successfully executed a flawless precision strike that killed the number-one terrorist anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him. Under my leadership, America's policy is unambiguous: To terrorists who harm or intend to harm any American, we will find you; we will eliminate you. We will always protect our diplomats, service members, all Americans, and our allies. For years, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its ruthless Quds Force , under Soleimani's leadership , has targeted, injured, and murdered hundreds of American civilians and servicemen. The recent attacks on U.S. targets in Iraq, including rocket strikes that killed an American and injured four American servicemen very badly, as well as a violent assault on our embassy in Baghdad, were carried out at the direction of Soleimani. Soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion, contributing to terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London. Today we remember and honor the victims of Soleimani's many atrocities, and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over. Soleimani has been perpetrating acts of terror to destabilize the Middle East for the last 20 years. What the United States did yesterday should have been done long ago. A lot of lives would have been saved. Just recently, Soleimani led the brutal repression of protestors in Iran, where more than a thousand innocent civilians were tortured and killed by their own government. We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war. I have deep respect for the Iranian people. They are a remarkable people, with an incredible heritage and unlimited potential. We do not seek regime change. However, the Iranian regime's aggression in the region, including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors, must end, and it must end now. The future belongs to the people of Iran , those who seek peaceful coexistence and cooperation , not the terrorist warlords who plunder their nation to finance bloodshed abroad. The United States has the best military by far, anywhere in the world. We have best intelligence in the world. If Americans anywhere are threatened, we have all of those targets already fully identified, and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary. And that, in particular, refers to Iran. Under my leadership, we have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and recently, American Special Operations Forces killed the terrorist leader known as al-Baghdadi. The world is a safer place without these monsters. America will always pursue the interests of good people, great people, great souls, while seeking peace, harmony, and friendship with all of the nations of the world. Thank you. God bless you. God bless our great military. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. END 3:18 P.M.

Good morning. I'm pleased to inform you: The American people should be extremely grateful and happy no Americans were harmed in last night's attack by the Iranian regime. We suffered no casualties, all of our soldiers are safe, and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases. Our great American forces are prepared for anything. Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world. No American or Iraqi lives were lost because of the precautions taken, the dispersal of forces, and an early warning system that worked very well. I salute the incredible skill and courage of America's men and women in uniform. For far too long , all the way back to 1979, to be exact , nations have tolerated Iran's destructive and destabilizing behavior in the Middle East and beyond. Those days are over. Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world. We will never let that happen. Last week, we took decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threatening American lives. At my direction, the United States military eliminated the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. As the head of the Quds Force, Soleimani was personally responsible for some of the absolutely worst atrocities. He trained terrorist armies, including Hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian targets. He fueled bloody civil wars all across the region. He viciously wounded and murdered thousands of U.S. troops, including the planting of roadside bombs that maim and dismember their victims. Soleimani directed the recent attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq that badly wounded four service members and killed one American, and he orchestrated the violent assault on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. In recent days, he was planning new attacks on American targets, but we stopped him. Soleimani's hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood. He should have been terminated long ago. By removing Soleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists: If you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people. As we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime. These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior. In recent months alone, Iran has seized ships in international waters, fired an unprovoked strike on Saudi Arabia, and shot down two U.S. drones. Iran's hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash. Instead of saying \"thank you\" to the United States, they chanted \"death to America.\" In fact, they chanted \"death to America\" the day the agreement was signed. Then, Iran went on a terror spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration. The regime also greatly tightened the reins on their own country, even recently killing 1,500 people at the many protests that are taking place all throughout Iran. The very defective JCPOA expires shortly anyway, and gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout. Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism. The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China to recognize this reality. They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal , or JCPOA , and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place. We must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper, and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential. Iran can be a great country. Peace and stability cannot prevail in the Middle East as long as Iran continues to foment violence, unrest, hatred, and war. The civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime: Your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer. It will not be allowed to go forward. Today, I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process. Over the last three years, under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before and America has achieved energy independence. These historic accompliments [accomplishments] changed our strategic priorities. These are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible. And options in the Middle East became available. We are now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil. The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration, at a cost of $2.5 trillion. U.S. Armed Forces are stronger than ever before. Our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal, and fast. Under construction are many hypersonic missiles. The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it. American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent. Three months ago, after destroying 100 percent of ISIS and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims, and all who stood in his way. He was a monster. Al-Baghdadi was trying again to rebuild the ISIS caliphate, and failed. Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters have been killed or captured during my administration. ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran. The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran, and we should work together on this and other shared priorities. Finally, to the people and leaders of Iran: We want you to have a future and a great future , one that you deserve, one of prosperity at home, and harmony with the nations of the world. The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it. I want to thank you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Please, sit down. Please. (Applause.) It is a great place, isn't it? It's the White House. It's a great place. And it's my pleasure to welcome our nation's mayors to the White House. We are here today to strengthen the bonds of cooperation between the federal and local governments so that we can deliver great jobs, excellent schools, affordable healthcare, and safe communities for all of our people. We are honored to be joined by Secretary Alex Azar , Alex, thank you very much. Secretary Ben Carson, who's done a wonderful job and deals with the mayors a lot. Right, Ben? Really great. Administrator Jovita Carranza , thank you very much. Thank you, Jovita. And Acting Secretary Chad Wolf , and your numbers are great. I just looked at your numbers. They're great, (inaudible). (Laughter.) We're , thank you very much, Chad. It's a lot of progress on the border. He , among many other things, including Coast Guard, he controls the border, and he's doing a good job. I also want to thank Mayor Bryan Barnett and , for helping to organize today's meeting. It's been a tremendous success that so many people accepted; few people didn't accept, actually. And I want to thank you all very much. All across America, cities are being lifted up by our booming economy. America is now the hottest economy anywhere in the world. We've created over 7 million jobs since the election , a number that would be unthought of. If I ever said that during the campaign , you know the feeling , they would have gone after me very strongly, huh? Huh? (Laughter and applause.) The unemployment rate is the lowest in more than half a century. African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country. African American, Hispanic American poverty rates are at record lows. Great. (Applause.) That's great. More than 2 million millennials have gotten jobs, and their wages have grown by nearly 5 percent every year , which is another record. We doubled the child tax credit, benefitting 40 million American families. And we've lifted 650,000 single mothers and 1.4 million children out of poverty. (Applause.) True. Ten million people have been lifted off of welfare in less than three years. Earnings for the bottom 10 percent are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 percent. You don't hear that too often, but it's been incredible, actually. For the first time in nearly 30 years, every single metro area in the United States has seen incomes rise. Median household income is at the highest level ever recorded. And, speaking of that, in terms of dollars: Under President Bush, it was a $450 increase over eight years; under President Obama, it was a $975 increase over eight years; and under your favorite President, President Trump , (laughter) , it was almost a $10,000 increase over less than three years. So we did it, as of less than three. (Applause.) We've been here now just three, as of a few days ago. Time flies. But $10,000. So that's , in a three-year period. So that's something really special. And they've never seen growth like that. We're delivering for Americans and we're doing it for every race and color, religion and creed, creating not only the most prosperous, but also the most inclusive economy anywhere in the world. I believe that. It's the most inclusive economy anywhere in the world. That's a great thing. To create jobs and opportunity, we designated nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones in distressed communities where capital gains on long-term investments are now taxed at zero. Opportunity Zones have been incredible. Tim Scott, the senator , great senator , from South Carolina, came to me two years ago, and he had this idea. And nobody knew it was going to work out the way it has, but billions and billions of dollars are pouring into the communities. Part of it also is the fact that we're doing so well, as an economy, that people have the money to put in. But it's , there's probably never been anything like this. Tremendous wealth is now pouring into areas that, for 100 years, saw nothing , no dollars, nothing. The 35 million Americans who live in these areas have already seen their home values rise by $25 billion over the country. My administration also understands that, for our cities to thrive, our citizens must be safe and they must be secure. And that's why we are working with state and local governments through the revitalized Project Safe Neighborhoods , you know that program: Project Safe Neighborhoods , to adopt the most proven and effective crime-fighting techniques. We're also enacting landmark criminal justice reform to improve reentry programs and reduce all of the things that we try and strive so hard to take care of. If you look at our prisons now, we have people coming out, and they're able to get jobs more than at any time ever in the history of our country. That's because the economy is so good, and we've given incentives, and it's been an incredible success. Employers are really, really happy. And people aren't going back to jail at anywhere near the clip. It's been something that's been incredible , criminal justice reform. I was asked by a group of people that were on the very liberal side of things, and we got a group of people that were on the very conservative side of things, and we got it done. Nobody was able to get it done. We got it done. Criminal justice reform. And that's something we're very proud of. It's really working fantastically well, as a lot of you , as a lot of you know. (Applause.) Before my election, violent crime was on the rise, and America saw the steepest two-year consecutive increase in murders in nearly half a century. It was in bad, bad condition. In just a short time, we've reduced the number of murders in America's major cities by more than 10 percent. And we're getting tremendous numbers coming out now, much better than even that. The nationwide violent crime rate has declined for two straight years. And, working with many leaders in this room, we have boldly tackled the opioid crisis. We've really made tremendous progress. In some cases, down 21 percent. Now, 21 percent is not much, when you think of the problem, but we have a lot of things happening. And fentanyl , I spoke with President Xi of China, and they're coming down very hard on fentanyl. We made our deal with China, as part of it , just in terms of relationship. I said, \"Really, you have to do something.\" And they've put in very strong penalties, and their penalties are really strong. You want to talk about penalties? Those are strict. (Laughter.) And their court cases go slightly quicker than ours. (Laughter.) Like , like one day. One day. They call them \"quick trials.\" They go quick. (Laughter.) They go so quick, you don't know what happened. (Laughter.) Ours take 15 years; theirs takes one day. But he was , he's been terrific on that. And we're seeing a tremendous , a tremendous difference in the fentanyl. Drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. The Department of Homeland Security is also working directly with many of the mayors in the cities, really, represented so brilliantly in this room, to remove dangerous criminals from your communities. We have , ICE is taking out MS-13 gang members by the thousands , by the thousands. And we're bringing them back to where they came from. And we've had great cooperation from those countries , Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Mexico. Mexico has been terrific. Mexico has given us 27,000 soldiers at our southern border. And we're working really well with Mexico , best we've ever worked with Mexico. When local police arrest a criminal, they run them through a federal database. If the criminal is found to be here illegally, ICE issues a detainer request. Honoring these detainers is vital to public safety, and we work with the mayors on that. And we have some sanctuary cities represented also in the room. But it's been , it's been a very tough thing, working with the sanctuary cities. But sanctuary city policies that order police to ignore these federal detainers and release criminal aliens to the public , that's really a tremendous risk. The public is , you see the statistics; you see the numbers. And it's just , One recent example: New York City arrested a criminal alien on assault charges. But, under city policy, they defied ICE's detainer request and released the violent criminal. After being freed by the city, the same criminal alien allegedly raped, brutalized, and murdered a 92-year-old woman on the streets of New York. This horrible crime , and there's so many others , was 100 percent preventable. They wanted to take this person , I'm being nice , take this person and bring them out and couldn't get them. I urge all of you here today to cooperate fully with the federal enforcement. We're all on the same team. I think that's the biggest point is we're all on the same team. We want to have safety. And you , some have sanctuary cities, but even if you have sanctuary cities, we want to be able to work together because tremendous differences in crime numbers can happen. And it's been happening. And with some of the mayors in the room , and I'm friends with a lot of you; I know a lot of you , we've had incredible success. To further ensure that every child can access the American Dream, we've made education a top priority. That's why we strongly support charter schools and the right of parents to send their kids to the school of their choice. We want choice. At the same time , and again, you're going to have to do what's good for your community, and we work with you. But we found that choice is something that's so popular , the people love it. The , so many different groups of people from different areas, they love choice. We want to ensure that the students and workers alike are able to take advantage of every opportunity in our soaring economy , and soaring it is. In the history of our country, we now have the best economy. Through our Pledge to the American Workers, more than 400 companies have committed to providing nearly 15 million new job and training opportunities. All Americans, no matter their age or background, should have access to cutting-edge programs that prepare them for the exciting jobs of tomorrow. We have many, many companies moving into the United States. They want to be where the action is. They're coming back , car companies; many, many forms of companies. And we're making it a priority to have those companies train people. And they're doing that now. We're up to 15 million people. It's really been incredible. My daughter Ivanka has worked very hard on that program. She wanted to do 500,000, two years ago, and we're going to be hitting, very shortly, 15 million. So, she did a great job. (Applause.) Great job. But families are at the center of our national agenda. We've made charitable , and child- , really, looking at it , looking it, we've made such progress with childcare, and more affordable and increased childcare funding for low-income parents. And we enacted paid family leave for government employees , a model for the entire community. Millions of families are benefitting from our ambitious campaign to lower the cost of prescription drugs , which is something you're all working on , and to hold big pharma accountable. One of things we're doing with Ron DeSantis in Florida is we're going to , we're very close to getting it done, I believe. Right, Mr. Secretary? Because of, really, some terrible laws that, if we worked together, if we were able to get the Democrats to go along, we could lower prescription prices tremendously. But what we're doing is we're going to allow our mayors, our governors to go out and make deals to buy it from Canada and, it could be, some other countries where the prices are much lower. In fact, I think you'll probably save 50 percent , \"five-oh.\" That'll be a number that nobody has ever even heard of. Can you imagine that? (Applause.) So, you'll end up saving , you'll end up saving 50 percent by buying it. Same pills, same box, same manufacturer in the manufacturing plant, and you save 50 percent, which tells you that we can do a lot of great things here. Why should that happen? But we're going to be buying a lot of things from Canada. Canada is very happy and they have much lower drug prices. Can you imagine if you went back and your programs , your prescription drugs were 50 percent lower? And we're going to be able to do that. So we have that in a number of states. And Ron is one of the leaders of it. As city leaders, you also know firsthand the vital importance of infrastructure and the painful delays imposed by meddlesome bureaucracy. Earlier this month, we issued a proposed new rule to reduce the permitting time by over 50 percent for building new roads, highways, bridges, and all of the different things that you have to build , infrastructure , in your communities. We have highways that were taking 21 years to get approved. And by the time they got there, they cost 20 times more. They cost millions , hundreds of millions of dollars. And we had one in a certain state , it took 17 years and it cost, I think, 41 times more expensive than they originally had approved. And it was , instead of a straight line, it was like this. In other words, not even a small drink if you were going to be a driver on that road because it was , (laughter) , what a mess. And 21 years it took, and it cost many, many times. And the road was a lot longer than it should have been, too, because of the twists and turns, which creates danger. And we have that down to two years now. And we think we'll have it down to one year. And you may get rejected, but it's going to go quickly. It's going to go quickly. (Applause.) And you know, we have , we have things out there for 20 years , highways , that should not be complicated and they can't get them approved. And in many cases, they go 20 years and then they get rejected. How would you like to work on that? You work half of your adult life , half of your working life on one road or highway , and at the end of it, they raise it and you lose three to two, and that's the end of the project. So for 20 years, you wasted half of your life. My administration stands ready to work with each one of you to make our cities safer and stronger and more vibrant than ever before. As part of this commitment, last year my administration launched an initiative to cut federal, state, and local regulations to reduce the cost of housing. We also hosted a White House summit last month on mental health , a really critical issue confronting many cities and states. Finally, in the face of attacks on synagogues, mosques, and churches in our community , something that is just so horrible , we must work together to reject the monstrous evils of anti-Semitism and anti-religious bigotry. (Applause.) And in a few moments, it's , thank you for that. That's , that's incredible enthusiasm for that. Incredible, because it's just , it's crazy; what's going on is crazy. In a few moments, I will sign legislation authorizing $375 million for federal grants to help houses of worship and other faith-based and non-profit organizations defend against violence. (Applause.) We are committed to building a nation where every community is secure, every family is safe, and every child can grow up in dignity and in peace. I want to again thank all of these mayors , they're such great mayors, at least some of you. I know a couple , (laughter). But that's okay. You're here. Maybe , maybe I'm wrong about that, right? (Laughter.) But I do, I know so many that have done such a great job in this room. Friends of mine. They love their job, they love what they're doing, and there's nobody in the world that can do it better. So I really appreciate you being here. Working together, we're making our cities into thriving and dynamic centers of culture and creativity, innovation, and commerce. And we're building a future where all of our citizens can achieve their own beautiful American Dream. And I just tell you, our country has never done better than it's doing right now. We're the envy of the world. Our economy is the strongest. We are doing deals like the great China deal. We'll be taking in $250 billion. That's tremendous. They'll be buying $250 [billion] , $50 billion from the farmers. And it could even go more. I mean, it could go higher. I don't know that they can even produce that much. The fact is: We love our farmers, but they were doing , the maximum they ever did was $16 billion in one year to China. And they had a deal that was done. It was at $20 [billion]. And I said, \"Make it $50 [billion].\" And everyone said, \"Well, you can't.\" I said, \"Make it $50 [billion].\" They said, \"You can't make that much.\" I said, \"That's okay, right. We'll buy larger tractors.\" (Laughter.) Guess you have to buy a little more land too, but they'll do it. You know, the farmers never let you down. The farmers are going to do it. It's to their benefit. But , so we're going really right in the other direction. We are going to have numbers. We've made a deal with Japan , $40 billion. A lot of that goes to farmers and manufacturers. And we've created 700,000 manufacturing jobs, which we were told by past administrations , but one, in particular , that you would never have manufacturing jobs. I would say, you have to be , I mean, how can you not have manufacturing jobs? So we're at 700,000 manufacturing jobs. I'd like to , (applause). Yeah. And these are great jobs, too. These are great jobs, skilled jobs, high-paying jobs. I'd like to now invite the mayors, community leaders, and members of my administration to join me on stage as I sign this incredible piece of legislation. It took a long time to get it here, but this is something that's very, very special and very, very great for you, as mayors. And again, keep up the good work. You've done an incredible job. Thank you. (Applause.) (The legislation is signed.) (Applause.)","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1396691\/remarks-by-president-trump-to-the-nations-mayors-on-transforming-americas-communities&speechType=1","Summary":"Federal, State and Local Relations","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-nations-mayors-transforming-americas-communities\/","CleanText":"Thank you very much. Please, sit down. Please. (Applause.) It is a great place, isn't it? It's the White House. It's a great place. And it's my pleasure to welcome our nation's mayors to the White House. We are here today to strengthen the bonds of cooperation between the federal and local governments so that we can deliver great jobs, excellent schools, affordable healthcare, and safe communities for all of our people. We are honored to be joined by Secretary Alex Azar , Alex, thank you very much. Secretary Ben Carson, who's done a wonderful job and deals with the mayors a lot. Right, Ben? Really great. Administrator Jovita Carranza , thank you very much. Thank you, Jovita. And Acting Secretary Chad Wolf , and your numbers are great. I just looked at your numbers. They're great, (inaudible). (Laughter.) We're , thank you very much, Chad. It's a lot of progress on the border. He , among many other things, including Coast Guard, he controls the border, and he's doing a good job. I also want to thank Mayor Bryan Barnett and , for helping to organize today's meeting. It's been a tremendous success that so many people accepted; few people didn't accept, actually. And I want to thank you all very much. All across America, cities are being lifted up by our booming economy. America is now the hottest economy anywhere in the world. We've created over 7 million jobs since the election , a number that would be unthought of. If I ever said that during the campaign , you know the feeling , they would have gone after me very strongly, huh? Huh? (Laughter and applause.) The unemployment rate is the lowest in more than half a century. African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country. African American, Hispanic American poverty rates are at record lows. Great. (Applause.) That's great. More than 2 million millennials have gotten jobs, and their wages have grown by nearly 5 percent every year , which is another record. We doubled the child tax credit, benefitting 40 million American families. And we've lifted 650,000 single mothers and 1.4 million children out of poverty. (Applause.) True. Ten million people have been lifted off of welfare in less than three years. Earnings for the bottom 10 percent are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 percent. You don't hear that too often, but it's been incredible, actually. For the first time in nearly 30 years, every single metro area in the United States has seen incomes rise. Median household income is at the highest level ever recorded. And, speaking of that, in terms of dollars: Under President Bush, it was a $450 increase over eight years; under President Obama, it was a $975 increase over eight years; and under your favorite President, President Trump , (laughter) , it was almost a $10,000 increase over less than three years. So we did it, as of less than three. (Applause.) We've been here now just three, as of a few days ago. Time flies. But $10,000. So that's , in a three-year period. So that's something really special. And they've never seen growth like that. We're delivering for Americans and we're doing it for every race and color, religion and creed, creating not only the most prosperous, but also the most inclusive economy anywhere in the world. I believe that. It's the most inclusive economy anywhere in the world. That's a great thing. To create jobs and opportunity, we designated nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones in distressed communities where capital gains on long-term investments are now taxed at zero. Opportunity Zones have been incredible. Tim Scott, the senator , great senator , from South Carolina, came to me two years ago, and he had this idea. And nobody knew it was going to work out the way it has, but billions and billions of dollars are pouring into the communities. Part of it also is the fact that we're doing so well, as an economy, that people have the money to put in. But it's , there's probably never been anything like this. Tremendous wealth is now pouring into areas that, for 100 years, saw nothing , no dollars, nothing. The 35 million Americans who live in these areas have already seen their home values rise by $25 billion over the country. My administration also understands that, for our cities to thrive, our citizens must be safe and they must be secure. And that's why we are working with state and local governments through the revitalized Project Safe Neighborhoods , you know that program: Project Safe Neighborhoods , to adopt the most proven and effective crime-fighting techniques. We're also enacting landmark criminal justice reform to improve reentry programs and reduce all of the things that we try and strive so hard to take care of. If you look at our prisons now, we have people coming out, and they're able to get jobs more than at any time ever in the history of our country. That's because the economy is so good, and we've given incentives, and it's been an incredible success. Employers are really, really happy. And people aren't going back to jail at anywhere near the clip. It's been something that's been incredible , criminal justice reform. I was asked by a group of people that were on the very liberal side of things, and we got a group of people that were on the very conservative side of things, and we got it done. Nobody was able to get it done. We got it done. Criminal justice reform. And that's something we're very proud of. It's really working fantastically well, as a lot of you , as a lot of you know. (Applause.) Before my election, violent crime was on the rise, and America saw the steepest two-year consecutive increase in murders in nearly half a century. It was in bad, bad condition. In just a short time, we've reduced the number of murders in America's major cities by more than 10 percent. And we're getting tremendous numbers coming out now, much better than even that. The nationwide violent crime rate has declined for two straight years. And, working with many leaders in this room, we have boldly tackled the opioid crisis. We've really made tremendous progress. In some cases, down 21 percent. Now, 21 percent is not much, when you think of the problem, but we have a lot of things happening. And fentanyl , I spoke with President Xi of China, and they're coming down very hard on fentanyl. We made our deal with China, as part of it , just in terms of relationship. I said, 'Really, you have to do something.' And they've put in very strong penalties, and their penalties are really strong. You want to talk about penalties? Those are strict. (Laughter.) And their court cases go slightly quicker than ours. (Laughter.) Like , like one day. One day. They call them 'quick trials.' They go quick. (Laughter.) They go so quick, you don't know what happened. (Laughter.) Ours take 15 years; theirs takes one day. But he was , he's been terrific on that. And we're seeing a tremendous , a tremendous difference in the fentanyl. Drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. The Department of Homeland Security is also working directly with many of the mayors in the cities, really, represented so brilliantly in this room, to remove dangerous criminals from your communities. We have , ICE is taking out MS-13 gang members by the thousands , by the thousands. And we're bringing them back to where they came from. And we've had great cooperation from those countries , Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Mexico. Mexico has been terrific. Mexico has given us 27,000 soldiers at our southern border. And we're working really well with Mexico , best we've ever worked with Mexico. When local police arrest a criminal, they run them through a federal database. If the criminal is found to be here illegally, ICE issues a detainer request. Honoring these detainers is vital to public safety, and we work with the mayors on that. And we have some sanctuary cities represented also in the room. But it's been , it's been a very tough thing, working with the sanctuary cities. But sanctuary city policies that order police to ignore these federal detainers and release criminal aliens to the public , that's really a tremendous risk. The public is , you see the statistics; you see the numbers. And it's just , One recent example: New York City arrested a criminal alien on assault charges. But, under city policy, they defied ICE's detainer request and released the violent criminal. After being freed by the city, the same criminal alien allegedly raped, brutalized, and murdered a 92-year-old woman on the streets of New York. This horrible crime , and there's so many others , was 100 percent preventable. They wanted to take this person , I'm being nice , take this person and bring them out and couldn't get them. I urge all of you here today to cooperate fully with the federal enforcement. We're all on the same team. I think that's the biggest point is we're all on the same team. We want to have safety. And you , some have sanctuary cities, but even if you have sanctuary cities, we want to be able to work together because tremendous differences in crime numbers can happen. And it's been happening.

EST THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much and thank you, Jeanne. It is my profound honor to be the first President in history to attend the March for Life. (Applause.) We're here for a very simple reason: to defend the right of every child, born and unborn, to fulfill their God-given potential. (Applause.) For 47 years, Americans of all backgrounds have traveled from across the country to stand for life. And today, as President of the United States, I am truly proud to stand with you. (Applause.) I want to welcome tens of thousands , this is a tremendous turnout , tens of thousands of high school and college students who took long bus rides , (applause) , to be here in our nation's capital. And to make you feel even better, there are tens of thousands of people outside that we passed on the way in. If anyone would like to give up their spot, we can work that out. (Laughter.) You have a tremendous group of people outside. Thousands and thousands wanted to get in. This is some great success. (Applause.) Young people are the heart of the March for Life, and it's your generation that is making America the pro-family, pro-life nation. (Applause.) The life movement is led by strong women, amazing faith leaders, and brave students who carry on the legacy of pioneers before us who fought to raise the conscience of our nation and uphold the rights of our citizens. You embrace mothers with care and compassion. You are powered by prayer, and motivated by pure, unselfish love. You're grateful , and we are so grateful , these are incredible people , to be joined by Secretary Alex Azar and Kellyanne Conway. (Applause.) Thank you. And thanks also to Senators Mike Lee and James Lankford, who are here. James, Mike , thank you, fellas. And Representatives Steve Scalise , (applause); Chris Smith , (applause); Ralph Abraham , (applause); Warren Davidson , (applause); Bob Latta , (applause); John Joyce , (applause); Lloyd Smucker , (applause); Brian Fitzpatrick , (applause); and Brad Wenstrup. (Applause.) Thank you, all. (Applause.) And I have to say , and I look at it , I see it exactly , we have many, many more politicians in the audience. But, if you don't mind, I won't introduce them all. (Laughter.) All of us here today understand an eternal truth: Every child is a precious and sacred gift from God. (Applause.) Together, we must protect, cherish, and defend the dignity and sanctity of every human life. (Applause.) When we see the image of a baby in the womb, we glimpse the majesty of God's creation. (Applause.) When we hold a newborn in our arms, we know the endless love that each child brings to a family. When we watch a child grow, we see the splendor that radiates from each human soul. One life changes the world. From my family , and I can tell you, I send love and I send great, great love. And from the first day in office, I've taken a historic action to support America's families and to protect the unborn. (Applause.) And during my first week in office, I reinstated and expanded the Mexico City Policy, and we issued a landmark pro-life rule to govern the use of Title X taxpayer funding. (Applause.) I notified Congress that I would veto any legislation that weakens pro-life policies or that encourages the destruction of human life. (Applause.) At the United Nations, I made clear that global bureaucrats have no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that protect innocent life. (Applause.) Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House. (Applause.) And as the Bible tells us, each person is \"wonderfully made.\" (Applause.) We have taken decisive action to protect the religious liberty , so important. Religious liberty has been under attack all over the world, and, frankly, very strongly attacked in our nation. You see it better than anyone. But we are stopping it, and we're taking care of doctors, nurses, teachers, and groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor. (Applause.) We are preserving faith-based adoption. (Applause.) And to uphold our founding documents, we have confirmed 187 federal judges , (applause) , who apply the Constitution as written, including two phenomenal Supreme Court Justices: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. (Applause.) We are protecting pro-life students' right to free speech on college campuses. (Applause.) And if universities want federal taxpayer dollars, then they must uphold your First Amendment right to speak your mind. And if they don't, they pay a very big financial penalty, which they will not be willing to pay. (Applause.) Sadly, the far-left is actively working to erase our God-given rights, shut down faith-based charities, ban religious believers from the public square, and silence Americans who believe in the sanctity of life. They are coming after me because I am fighting for you and we are fighting for those who have no voice. And we will win because we know how to win. (Applause.) We all know how to win. We all know how to win. You've been winning for a long time. You've been winning for a long time. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: Together, we are the voice for the voiceless. When it comes to abortion, Democrats is a , and you know this, you've seen what's happened , Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions taken and seen in this country for years, and decades , and you can even say \"for centuries.\" AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: Nearly every top Democrat in Congress now supports taxpayer-funded abortion, all the way up until the moment of birth. AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: Last year, lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb right up until delivery. AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: Then, we had the case of the Democrat governor in the state of Virginia , the Commonwealth of Virginia. AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: And we love the Commonwealth of Virginia, but what is going on in Virginia? What is going on? The Governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth. You remember that. Senate Democrats even blocked legislation that would give medical care to babies who survive attempted abortions. That's why I've called on Congress , two of our great senators here, so many of our congressmen here , and called upon them to defend the dignity of life and to pass legislation prohibiting late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in their mother's womb. (Applause.) This year, the March for Life is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which forever enshrined women's rights to vote in the United States , (applause) , and given by the United States Constitution. Such a big event. (Applause.) Today, millions of extraordinary women across America are using the power of their votes to fight for the right, and all of their rights, as given in the Declaration of Independence , it's the right to life. To all the women here today: Your devotion and your leadership uplifts our entire nation, and we thank you for that. The tens of thousands of Americans gathered today not only stand for life , it's really that they stand for it so proudly together, and I want to thank everybody for that. You stand for life each and every day. You provide housing, education, jobs, and medical care to the women that you serve. You find loving families for children in need of a forever home. You host baby showers for expecting moms. You make , you just make it your life's mission to help spread God's grace. And to all of the moms here today: We celebrate you, and we declare that mothers are heroes. (Applause.) That's true. Your strength, devotion, and drive is what powers our nation. And, because of you, our country has been blessed with amazing souls who have changed the course of human history. We cannot know what our citizens yet unborn will achieve, the dreams they will imagine, the masterpieces they will create, the discoveries they will make. But we know this: Every life brings love into this world. Every child brings joy to a family. Every person is worth protecting. (Applause.) And above all, we know that every human soul is divine, and every human life , born and unborn , is made in the holy image of Almighty God. (Applause.) Together, we will defend this truth all across our magnificent land. We will set free the dreams of our people. And with determined hope, we look forward to all of the blessings that will come from the beauty, talent, purpose, nobility, and grace of every American child. I want to thank you. This is a very special moment. It's so great to represent you. I love you all and , (applause) , and I say with true passion: Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you. (Applause.) END 12:41 P.M.

It is my profound honor to be the first President in history to attend the March for Life. (Applause.) We're here for a very simple reason: to defend the right of every child, born and unborn, to fulfill their God-given potential. (Applause.) For 47 years, Americans of all backgrounds have traveled from across the country to stand for life. And today, as President of the United States, I am truly proud to stand with you. (Applause.) I want to welcome tens of thousands , this is a tremendous turnout , tens of thousands of high school and college students who took long bus rides , (applause) , to be here in our nation's capital. And to make you feel even better, there are tens of thousands of people outside that we passed on the way in. If anyone would like to give up their spot, we can work that out. (Laughter.) You have a tremendous group of people outside. Thousands and thousands wanted to get in. This is some great success. (Applause.) Young people are the heart of the March for Life, and it's your generation that is making America the pro-family, pro-life nation. (Applause.) The life movement is led by strong women, amazing faith leaders, and brave students who carry on the legacy of pioneers before us who fought to raise the conscience of our nation and uphold the rights of our citizens. You embrace mothers with care and compassion. You are powered by prayer, and motivated by pure, unselfish love. You're grateful , and we are so grateful , these are incredible people , to be joined by Secretary Alex Azar and Kellyanne Conway. (Applause.) Thank you. And thanks also to Senators Mike Lee and James Lankford, who are here. James, Mike , thank you, fellas. And Representatives Steve Scalise , (applause); Chris Smith , (applause); Ralph Abraham , (applause); Warren Davidson , (applause); Bob Latta , (applause); John Joyce , (applause); Lloyd Smucker , (applause); Brian Fitzpatrick , (applause); and Brad Wenstrup. (Applause.) Thank you, all. (Applause.) And I have to say , and I look at it , I see it exactly , we have many, many more politicians in the audience. But, if you don't mind, I won't introduce them all. (Laughter.) All of us here today understand an eternal truth: Every child is a precious and sacred gift from God. (Applause.) Together, we must protect, cherish, and defend the dignity and sanctity of every human life. (Applause.) When we see the image of a baby in the womb, we glimpse the majesty of God's creation. (Applause.) When we hold a newborn in our arms, we know the endless love that each child brings to a family. When we watch a child grow, we see the splendor that radiates from each human soul. One life changes the world. From my family , and I can tell you, I send love and I send great, great love. And from the first day in office, I've taken a historic action to support America's families and to protect the unborn. (Applause.) And during my first week in office, I reinstated and expanded the Mexico City Policy, and we issued a landmark pro-life rule to govern the use of Title X taxpayer funding. (Applause.) I notified Congress that I would veto any legislation that weakens pro-life policies or that encourages the destruction of human life. (Applause.) At the United Nations, I made clear that global bureaucrats have no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that protect innocent life. (Applause.) Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House. (Applause.) And as the Bible tells us, each person is 'wonderfully made.' (Applause.) We have taken decisive action to protect the religious liberty , so important. Religious liberty has been under attack all over the world, and, frankly, very strongly attacked in our nation. You see it better than anyone. But we are stopping it, and we're taking care of doctors, nurses, teachers, and groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor. (Applause.) We are preserving faith-based adoption. (Applause.) And to uphold our founding documents, we have confirmed 187 federal judges , (applause) , who apply the Constitution as written, including two phenomenal Supreme Court Justices: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. (Applause.) We are protecting pro-life students' right to free speech on college campuses. (Applause.) And if universities want federal taxpayer dollars, then they must uphold your First Amendment right to speak your mind. And if they don't, they pay a very big financial penalty, which they will not be willing to pay. (Applause.) Sadly, the far-left is actively working to erase our God-given rights, shut down faith-based charities, ban religious believers from the public square, and silence Americans who believe in the sanctity of life. They are coming after me because I am fighting for you and we are fighting for those who have no voice. And we will win because we know how to win. (Applause.) We all know how to win.

Their fight for equality, representation, and respect motivates us to continue working for a more promising, peaceful, and hopeful future for every American. During National African American History Month, we honor the extraordinary contributions made by African Americans throughout the history of our Republic, and we renew our commitment to liberty and justice for all. The theme of this year's observance, \"African Americans and the Vote,\" coincides with the 150th anniversary of the 15th Amendment, which gave African American men the right to vote. This Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1870, prohibits the government from denying or abridging a citizen's right to vote based on \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" Today, this guarantee is enforced primarily throughout the Voting Rights Act of 1965, an enduring legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Civil Rights movement. This year also marks the 150th anniversary of the first African American to serve in the Congress. In 1870, Hiram Revels, a Mississippi Republican, served a 1-year term in the Senate, where he fought for justice and racial equality. During his lifetime, Senator Revels served as a military chaplain, a minister with the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and a college administrator. But it was Revels' tenure in the Congress that truly distinguished him as a trailblazer. He made history serving our Nation in a building that had been constructed by slave laborers just a decade earlier. My Administration has made great strides in expanding opportunity for people of all backgrounds. Over the past 2 years, the poverty and unemployment rates for African Americans have reached historic lows. Through the transformative Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, more than 8,700 distressed communities battling economic hardship have been designated Opportunity Zones, creating a path for struggling communities to unlock investment resources and create much needed jobs and community amenities. I also signed into law the historic First Step Act, which rolled back unjust provisions of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which disproportionately harmed African American communities. The First Step Act provides inmates with opportunities for job training, education, and mentorship. We want every person leaving prison to have the tools they need to take advantage of a second chance to transform their lives and pursue the American dream after incarceration. Additionally, last December, I was proud to sign into law the groundbreaking FUTURE Act, which ensures full support for historically black colleges and universities over the next 10 years. Our great Nation is strengthened and enriched by citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. This month, we celebrate the cultural heritage, diverse contributions, and unbreakable spirit of African Americans. We commend the heroes, pioneers, and common Americans who tirelessly fought for , and firmly believed in , the promise of racial equality granted by our Creator, enshrined in our Constitution, and enacted into our laws. We pledge to continue to stand against the evils of bigotry, intolerance, and hatred so that we may continue in our pursuit of a more perfect Union. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2020 as National African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, and all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

EST THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States , (applause) , and my fellow citizens: Three years ago, we launched the great American comeback. Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again. (Applause.) America's enemies are on the run, America's fortunes are on the rise, and America's future is blazing bright. The years of economic decay are over. (Applause.) The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. (Applause.) Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige. In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny. We have totally rejected the downsizing. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back. (Applause.) I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world , and it's not even close. Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored. And for all of these reasons, I say to the people of our great country and to the members of Congress: The state of our Union is stronger than ever before. (Applause.) The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society , one where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise. From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the U.S. economy , slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. (Applause.) Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American. (Applause.) Thank you. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed very, very high. Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs , 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration. (Applause.) The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century. (Applause.) And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. (Applause.) True. If we hadn't reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success. (Applause.) The unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history. (Applause.) African American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low. (Applause.) African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded. (Applause.) The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years. And, last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added. (Applause.) The veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low. (Applause.) The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low. (Applause.) Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in U.S. history. (Applause.) A record number of young Americans are now employed. (Applause.) Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare. (Applause.) In eight years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce. In just three years of my administration, 3.5 million people , working-age people , have joined the workforce. (Applause.) Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent , three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. (Applause.) After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast , and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay increase since my election. (Applause.) This is a blue-collar boom. (Applause.) Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded. (Applause.) Since my election, U.S. stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our nation's wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible. This is a record. It is something that every country in the world is looking up to. They admire. (Applause.) Consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs. All of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent, and even more. Jobs and investments are pouring into 9,000 previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts. (Applause.) In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven't seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement. (Applause.) This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It's all working. Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family. He was homeless. But then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones. He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight. Tony, keep up the great work. Tony. (Applause.) Thank you, Tony. Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law. Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn't be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done. (Applause.) Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far. (Applause.) With the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many other elements of our country, are at a record high. (Applause.) We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago. Likewise, we are restoring our nation's manufacturing might, even though predictions were, as you all know, that this could never, ever be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration, with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built. (Applause.) Companies are not leaving; they are coming back to the USA. (Applause.) The fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is. (Applause.) One of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. (Applause.) In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President. Following NAFTA's adoption, our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do so, and then absolutely nothing happened. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. We did our job. (Applause.) Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. (Applause.) It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level, but also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity. We will have that: fairness and reciprocity. And I say that, finally, because it's been many, many years that we were treated fairly on trade. (Applause.) This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America's labor unions. (Applause.) I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of America's jobs. Our strategy has worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions and billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the USA. (Applause.) For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States. Now we have changed that, but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we've ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we've done because, quite frankly, they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying, \"That's enough.\" (Applause.) Now we want to rebuild our country, and that's exactly what we're doing. We are rebuilding our country. As we restore , (applause) , American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. (Applause.) That's why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba. (Applause.) We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. (Applause.) Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken. Here this evening is a very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the Gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaid\u00f3. (Applause.) Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland. (Applause.) Thank you, Mr. President. Great honor. Thank you very much. Please take this message back that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom. Thank you very much, Mr. President. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Socialism destroys nations. But always remember: Freedom unifies the soul. (Applause.) To safeguard American liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States military. (Applause.) We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment, and it's all made right here in the USA. (Applause.) We are also getting our allies, finally, to help pay their fair share. (Applause.) I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of Allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled. And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a brand-new branch of the United States Armed Forces. It's called the Space Force. (Applause.) Very important. In the Gallery tonight, we have a young gentleman. And what he wants so badly , 13 years old , Iain Lanphier. He's an eighth grader from Arizona. Iain, please stand up. Iain has always dreamed of going to space. He was the first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then he has his eye on the Space Force. As Iain says, \"Most people look up at space. I want to look down on the world.\" (Laughter and applause.) But sitting behind Iain tonight is his greatest hero of them all. Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen , the first black fighter pilots , and he also happens to be Iain's great-grandfather. (Applause.) Incredible story. After more than 130 combat missions in World War Two, he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. (Applause.) A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee, our nation salutes you. Thank you, sir. (Applause.) From the pilgrims to the Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King, Americans have always rejected limits on our children's future. Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people. (Applause.) The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first. (Applause.) The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students, 18 states have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list. One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah. (Applause.) Janiyah's mom, Stephanie, is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children. Janiyah and Stephanie are in the Gallery. Stephanie, thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter. Thank you very much. (Applause.) But, Janiyah, I have some good news for you, because I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over. I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship has become available, it's going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice. (Applause.) Now I call on Congress to give one million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received. Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunities Act , because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school. (Applause.) Every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow. For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the BE BEST initiative to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation , online, in school, and in our communities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America's children. Thank you very much. (Applause.) My administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background. Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans. My budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation's high schools. Tonight, I ask Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America. (Applause.) To expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation's historically black colleges and universities. (Applause.) A good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth. Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive , and better. (Applause.) I've also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. (Applause). And we will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security. Always. (Applause.) The American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills. That is why I signed an executive order requiring price transparency. (Applause.) Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform. (Applause.) It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care. But as we work to improve Americans' healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely. AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare. (Applause.) Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors and that our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. That is what is happening in California and other states. Their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government healthcare for illegal aliens. (Applause.) This will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built. (Applause.) We have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time. Early next year, we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed. My administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before. (Applause.) And I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down. (Applause.) And working together, Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I've been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done quickly and properly. I'm calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill on my desk, and I will sign it into law immediately. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: H.R.3! H.R.3! H.R.3! With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. (Applause.) Among the states hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent , and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all. (Applause.) Protecting Americans' health also means fighting infectious diseases. We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China. My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat. We have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer's, and those struggling with mental health. And because Congress was so good as to fund my request, new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of this decade. (Applause.) Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness. Here tonight is a special man, beloved by millions of Americans who just received a Stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis. This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet. Rush Limbaugh, thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country. (Applause.) And, Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. (Applause.) I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to present you with the honor. Please. (Applause.) (The Medal of Freedom is presented.) (Applause.) Rush and Kathryn, congratulations. Thank you, Kathryn. As we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs. In 2017, doctors at St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive. Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was a born fighter. Through the skill of her doctors and the prayers of her parents, little Ellie kept on winning the battle of life. Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy two-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the Gallery. Ellie and Robin, we are glad to have you with us tonight. (Applause.) Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life. And thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive. It's an incredible thing. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is why I'm asking Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neonatal research for America's youngest patients. (Applause.) That is why I'm also calling upon members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies. (Applause.) Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God. As we support America's moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country. (Applause.) Now I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across our nation. (Applause.) Forty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit. (Applause.) I've also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 states to help more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether. (Applause.) And I sent Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality child care, and urge you to act immediately. (Applause.) To protect the environment, days ago I announced that the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world. (Applause.) We must also rebuild America's infrastructure. (Applause.) I ask you to pass Senator John Barrasso's highway bill to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels all across our land. I'm also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed Internet, including and especially in rural America. (Applause.) A better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe. That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our nation's heroic ICE officers. (Applause.) Last year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders. Tragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens. AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed. Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman. The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York's sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had honored ICE's detainer request, his victim would still be alive today. The state of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants , a very terrible sanctuary , with catastrophic results. Here is just one tragic example. In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault. But as required by California's Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him. Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work. He approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and in the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims. One of the victims is , a terrible, terrible situation; died , 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones. Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood. Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers, who loved him more than anything else in the world. One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight. Jody, would you please stand? Jody, thank you. (Applause.) Jody our hearts weep for your loss, and we will not rest until you have justice. Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly practices. (Applause.) I ask Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. (Applause.) In the last three years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers. And I have signed nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and all around the globe. My administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States. (Applause.) Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again. My administration has ended catch and release. (Applause.) If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed from our country. (Applause.) Very importantly, we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May, dropping eight straight months in a row. (Applause.) And as the wall rapidly goes up, drug seizures rise, and the border crossings are down, and going down very rapidly. Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol, and he joins us tonight. Chief Ortiz, please stand. (Applause.) A grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of Border Patrol and ICE. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values. (Applause.) With every action, my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom. (Applause.) Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , thank you, Mitch , (applause) , and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written. This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Thank you. (Applause.) And we have many in the pipeline. (Laughter and applause.) My administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools. (Applause.) In America, we don't punish prayer. We don't tear down crosses. We don't ban symbols of faith. We don't muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith, we cherish religion, we lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God. Just as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country. So long as I am President, I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) In reaffirming our heritage as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation. Now we must embrace the next frontier, America's manifest destiny in the stars. I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the Moon will be American astronauts , (applause) , using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars. (Applause.) My administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism. (Applause.) Last week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future. Three years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS , the bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi , is dead. (Applause.) We are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller. After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker. She once wrote, \"Some people find God in church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God in love. I find God in suffering. I've known for some time what my life's work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering.\" In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of al-Baghdadi himself. After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, al-Baghdadi murdered young, beautiful Kayla. She was just 26 years old. On the night that U.S. Special Forces Operations ended al-Baghdadi's miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room. He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name: \"Task Force 8-14.\" It was a reference to a special day: August 14th , Kayla's birthday. Carl and Marsha, America's warriors never forgot Kayla , and neither will we. Thank you. (Applause.) Every day, America's men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depth of love that dwells in the human heart. One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake. On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his one-year-old son, Gage: \"I will be with you again,\" he wrote to Gage. \"I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports, and see you have kids also. I love you son. Take care of your mother. I am always with you. Daddy.\" On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the Gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now a 13-year-old and doing very, very well. To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever. He is looking down on you now. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you both very much. The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris's life. Soleimani was the Iranian regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. As the world's top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children. He directed the December assault and went on to assault U.S. forces in Iraq. Was actively planning new attacks when we hit him very hard. And that's why, last month, at my direction, the U.S. military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever. (Applause.) Our message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life. (Applause.) In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons; stop spreading terror, death, and destruction; and start working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very, very poorly. We can help them make a very good and short-time recovery. It can all go very quickly, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let's see which road they choose. It is totally up to them. (Applause.) As we defend American lives, we are working to end America's wars in the Middle East. In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are now underway. I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them totally innocent. It is also not our function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies. These are warfighters that we have , the best in the world , and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home. (Applause.) War places a heavy burden on our nation's extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her two children , six-year-old Elliana and three-year-old Rowan. Amy works full-time and volunteers countless hours helping other military families. For the past seven months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment in the Middle East. Amy's kids haven't seen their father's face in many months. Amy, your family's sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and in peace, and we want to thank you. Thank you, Amy. (Applause.) But, Amy, there is one more thing. Tonight, we have a very special surprise. I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment. He is here with us tonight, and we couldn't keep him waiting any longer. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT: Welcome home, Sergeant Williams. Thank you very much. As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. This is a place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great generals including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo , (applause) , the beautiful, beautiful Alamo. The American nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk on the face of the Earth. Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out the canals, raised up the skyscrapers. And, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional republic ever to exist in all of human history, and we are making it greater than ever before. (Applause.) This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance. We are Americans. We are pioneers. We are the pathfinders. We settled the New World, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God. (Applause.) America is the place where anything can happen. America is the place where anyone can rise. And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true. This nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored. Our brightest discoveries are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories are not yet told. Our grandest journeys are not yet made. The American Age, the American Epic, the American adventure has only just begun. Our spirit is still young, the sun is still rising, God's grace is still shining, and, my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come. (Applause.) Thank you. God Bless You. And God Bless America. Thank you very much. (Applause.) END 10:24 P.M.

Thank you. Thank you very much. Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States , (applause) , and my fellow citizens: Three years ago, we launched the great American comeback. Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again. (Applause.) America's enemies are on the run, America's fortunes are on the rise, and America's future is blazing bright. The years of economic decay are over. (Applause.) The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. (Applause.) Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige. In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny. We have totally rejected the downsizing. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back. (Applause.) I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world , and it's not even close. Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored. And for all of these reasons, I say to the people of our great country and to the members of Congress: The state of our Union is stronger than ever before. (Applause.) The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society , one where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise. From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the U.S. economy , slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. (Applause.) Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American. (Applause.) Thank you. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed very, very high. Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs , 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration. (Applause.) The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century. (Applause.) And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. (Applause.) True. If we hadn't reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success. (Applause.) The unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history. (Applause.) African American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low. (Applause.) African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded. (Applause.) The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years. And, last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added. (Applause.) The veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low. (Applause.) The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low. (Applause.) Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in U.S. history. (Applause.) A record number of young Americans are now employed. (Applause.) Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare. (Applause.) In eight years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce. In just three years of my administration, 3.5 million people , working-age people , have joined the workforce. (Applause.) Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent , three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. (Applause.) After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast , and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay increase since my election. (Applause.) This is a blue-collar boom. (Applause.) Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded. (Applause.) Since my election, U.S. stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our nation's wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible. This is a record. It is something that every country in the world is looking up to. They admire. (Applause.) Consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs. All of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent, and even more. Jobs and investments are pouring into 9,000 previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts. (Applause.) In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven't seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement. (Applause.) This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It's all working. Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family. He was homeless. But then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones. He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight. Tony, keep up the great work. Tony. (Applause.) Thank you, Tony. Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law. Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn't be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done. (Applause.) Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far. (Applause.) With the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many other elements of our country, are at a record high. (Applause.) We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago. Likewise, we are restoring our nation's manufacturing might, even though predictions were, as you all know, that this could never, ever be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration, with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built. (Applause.) Companies are not leaving; they are coming back to the USA. (Applause.) The fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is. (Applause.) One of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. (Applause.) In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President. Following NAFTA's adoption, our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do so, and then absolutely nothing happened. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. We did our job. (Applause.) Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. (Applause.) It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level, but also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity. We will have that: fairness and reciprocity. And I say that, finally, because it's been many, many years that we were treated fairly on trade. (Applause.) This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America's labor unions. (Applause.) I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of America's jobs. Our strategy has worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions and billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the USA. (Applause.) For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States. Now we have changed that, but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we've ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we've done because, quite frankly, they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying, 'That's enough.' (Applause.) Now we want to rebuild our country, and that's exactly what we're doing. We are rebuilding our country. As we restore , (applause) , American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. (Applause.) That's why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba. (Applause.) We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicol\ufffds Maduro. (Applause.) Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken. Here this evening is a very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the Gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaid\ufffd. (Applause.) Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland. (Applause.) Thank you, Mr. President. Great honor. Thank you very much. Please take this message back that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom. Thank you very much, Mr. President. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Socialism destroys nations. But always remember: Freedom unifies the soul. (Applause.) To safeguard American liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States military. (Applause.) We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment, and it's all made right here in the USA. (Applause.) We are also getting our allies, finally, to help pay their fair share. (Applause.) I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of Allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled. And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a brand-new branch of the United States Armed Forces. It's called the Space Force. (Applause.) Very important. In the Gallery tonight, we have a young gentleman. And what he wants so badly , 13 years old , Iain Lanphier. He's an eighth grader from Arizona. Iain, please stand up. Iain has always dreamed of going to space. He was the first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then he has his eye on the Space Force. As Iain says, 'Most people look up at space. I want to look down on the world.' (Laughter and applause.) But sitting behind Iain tonight is his greatest hero of them all. Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen , the first black fighter pilots , and he also happens to be Iain's great-grandfather. (Applause.) Incredible story. After more than 130 combat missions in World War Two, he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. (Applause.) A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee, our nation salutes you. Thank you, sir. (Applause.) From the pilgrims to the Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King, Americans have always rejected limits on our children's future. Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people. (Applause.) The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first. (Applause.) The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students, 18 states have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list. One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah. (Applause.) Janiyah's mom, Stephanie, is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children. Janiyah and Stephanie are in the Gallery. Stephanie, thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter. Thank you very much. (Applause.) But, Janiyah, I have some good news for you, because I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over. I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship has become available, it's going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice. (Applause.) Now I call on Congress to give one million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received. Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunities Act , because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school. (Applause.) Every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow. For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the BE BEST initiative to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation , online, in school, and in our communities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America's children. Thank you very much. (Applause.) My administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background. Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans. My budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation's high schools. Tonight, I ask Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America. (Applause.) To expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation's historically black colleges and universities. (Applause.) A good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth. Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive , and better. (Applause.) I've also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. (Applause). And we will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security. Always. (Applause.) The American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills. That is why I signed an executive order requiring price transparency. (Applause.) Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform. (Applause.) It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care. But as we work to improve Americans' healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely. One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare. (Applause.) Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors and that our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. That is what is happening in California and other states. Their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government healthcare for illegal aliens. (Applause.) This will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built. (Applause.) We have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time. Early next year, we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed. My administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before. (Applause.) And I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down. (Applause.) And working together, Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I've been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done quickly and properly. I'm calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill on my desk, and I will sign it into law immediately. (Applause.) In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed. Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman. The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York's sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had honored ICE's detainer request, his victim would still be alive today. The state of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants , a very terrible sanctuary , with catastrophic results. Here is just one tragic example. In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault. But as required by California's Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him. Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work. He approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and in the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims. One of the victims is , a terrible, terrible situation; died , 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones. Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood. Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers, who loved him more than anything else in the world. One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight. Jody, would you please stand? Jody, thank you. (Applause.) Jody our hearts weep for your loss, and we will not rest until you have justice. Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly practices. (Applause.) I ask Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. (Applause.) In the last three years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers. And I have signed nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and all around the globe. My administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States. (Applause.) Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again. My administration has ended catch and release. (Applause.) If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed from our country. (Applause.) Very importantly, we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May, dropping eight straight months in a row. (Applause.) And as the wall rapidly goes up, drug seizures rise, and the border crossings are down, and going down very rapidly. Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol, and he joins us tonight. Chief Ortiz, please stand. (Applause.) A grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of Border Patrol and ICE. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values. (Applause.) With every action, my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom. (Applause.) Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , thank you, Mitch , (applause) , and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written. This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Thank you. (Applause.) And we have many in the pipeline. (Laughter and applause.) My administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools. (Applause.) In America, we don't punish prayer. We don't tear down crosses. We don't ban symbols of faith. We don't muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith, we cherish religion, we lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God. Just as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country. So long as I am President, I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) In reaffirming our heritage as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation. Now we must embrace the next frontier, America's manifest destiny in the stars. I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the Moon will be American astronauts , (applause) , using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars. (Applause.) My administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism. (Applause.) Last week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future. Three years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS , the bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi , is dead. (Applause.) We are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller. After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker. She once wrote, 'Some people find God in church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God in love. I find God in suffering. I've known for some time what my life's work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering.' In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of al-Baghdadi himself. After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, al-Baghdadi murdered young, beautiful Kayla. She was just 26 years old. On the night that U.S. Special Forces Operations ended al-Baghdadi's miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room. He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name: 'Task Force 8-14.' It was a reference to a special day: August 14th , Kayla's birthday. Carl and Marsha, America's warriors never forgot Kayla , and neither will we. Thank you. (Applause.) Every day, America's men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depth of love that dwells in the human heart. One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake. On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his one-year-old son, Gage: 'I will be with you again,' he wrote to Gage. 'I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports, and see you have kids also. I love you son. Take care of your mother. I am always with you. Daddy.' On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the Gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now a 13-year-old and doing very, very well. To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever. He is looking down on you now. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you both very much. The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris's life. Soleimani was the Iranian regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. As the world's top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children. He directed the December assault and went on to assault U.S. forces in Iraq. Was actively planning new attacks when we hit him very hard. And that's why, last month, at my direction, the U.S. military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever. (Applause.) Our message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life. (Applause.) In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons; stop spreading terror, death, and destruction; and start working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very, very poorly. We can help them make a very good and short-time recovery. It can all go very quickly, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let's see which road they choose. It is totally up to them. (Applause.) As we defend American lives, we are working to end America's wars in the Middle East. In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are now underway. I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them totally innocent. It is also not our function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies. These are warfighters that we have , the best in the world , and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home. (Applause.) War places a heavy burden on our nation's extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her two children , six-year-old Elliana and three-year-old Rowan. Amy works full-time and volunteers countless hours helping other military families. For the past seven months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment in the Middle East. Amy's kids haven't seen their father's face in many months. Amy, your family's sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and in peace, and we want to thank you. Thank you, Amy. (Applause.) But, Amy, there is one more thing. Tonight, we have a very special surprise. I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment. He is here with us tonight, and we couldn't keep him waiting any longer. (Applause.) Welcome home, Sergeant Williams. Thank you very much. As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. This is a place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great generals including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo , (applause) , the beautiful, beautiful Alamo. The American nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk on the face of the Earth. Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out the canals, raised up the skyscrapers. And, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional republic ever to exist in all of human history, and we are making it greater than ever before. (Applause.) This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance. We are Americans. We are pioneers. We are the pathfinders. We settled the New World, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God. (Applause.) America is the place where anything can happen. America is the place where anyone can rise. And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true. This nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored. Our brightest discoveries are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories are not yet told. Our grandest journeys are not yet made. The American Age, the American Epic, the American adventure has only just begun. Our spirit is still young, the sun is still rising, God's grace is still shining, and, my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come. (Applause.) Thank you. God Bless You. And God Bless America. Thank you very much. (Applause.)"}

EST THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Wow. (Applause.) Well, thank you very much, everybody. Wow. We've all been through a lot together, and we probably deserve that hand for all of us, because it's been a very unfair situation. I invited some of our very good friends. And we have limited room, but everybody wanted to come. We kept it down to a minimum. And believe it or not, this is a minimum. But a tremendous thing was done over the last number of months, but really, if you go back to it, over the last number of years. We had the witch hunt. It started from the day we came down the elevator, myself and our future First Lady, who's with us right now. Thank you, Melania. (Applause.) And it never really stopped. We've been going through this now for over three years. It was evil. It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars. And this should never, ever happen to another President ever. I don't know that other Presidents would have been able to take it. Some people said, no, they wouldn't have. But I can tell you, at a minimum, you have to focus on this because it can get away very quickly. No matter who you have with you, it can get away very quickly. It was a disgrace. Had I not fired James Comey , who was a disaster, by the way , it's possible I wouldn't even be standing here right now. We caught him in the act. Dirty cops. Bad people. If this happened to President Obama, a lot of people would have been in jail for a long time already. Many, many years. I want to start by thanking some of , and I call them friends, because, you know, you develop friendships and relationships when you're in battle and war, much more so than, \"Gee, let's have a normal situation.\" With all that we've gone through, we've done, I think, more than any President and administration, and really, I say, for the most part, Republican congressmen, congresswomen, and Republican senators. We've done more than any administration in the first few years, if you look at all of the things we've done. I watched this morning as they tried to take credit for the stock market from , (laughter) , from , think of that. Let me tell you, if we didn't win, the stock market would have crashed. And the market was going up a lot before the election because it was looking we had a good chance to win, and then it went up tremendously from the time we won the election until the time we took office, which was November 8th to January 20th. And that's our credit. That's all our credit. And leading up to that point was our credit because there was hope. And one of the reasons the stock market has gone up so much in the last few days is people think we're doing so well. They liked the State of the Union speech. (Applause.) It really is , it's a true honor to give it. Making the State of the Union speech, I was with some people that have been around; they've been all over the world. And one of them, a highly sophisticated person, said, \"You know, no matter where you go in the world, it doesn't make any difference , there is nothing like what I witnessed tonight.\" The beauty, the majesty of the Chamber. The power of the United States, the power of the people in this room. Really, an amazing , I don't think there is anything like that anywhere in the world. You can go to any other country, you can go to any other location, any other place. It's the beauty of everything. It's what it represents and how it represents our country. I want to start by introducing some of the people that are here. I know some are going to be left out. But they work so hard. And this is really not a news conference. It's not a speech. It's not anything. It's just we're sort of , it's a celebration, because we have something that just worked out. I mean, it worked out. We went through hell, unfairly. Did nothing wrong. Did nothing wrong. I've done things wrong in my life, I will admit. (Laughter.) Not purposely, but I've done things wrong. But this is what the end result is. (Applause.) (The President holds up the front cover of The Washington Post newspaper.) We can take that home, Honey. Maybe we'll frame it. (Laughter.) It's the only good headline I've ever had in the Washington Post, I'll tell you. (Laughter.) But every paper is the same. Does anybody have those papers? Does anybody have them? Because they're really like that. So I appreciate that. But some of the people here have been incredible warriors. They're warriors. And there's nothing, from a legal standpoint , this is a political thing. And every time, I'd say, \"This is unfair. Let's go to court.\" They'd say, \"Sir, you can't go to court. This is politics.\" And we were treated unbelievably unfairly. And you have to understand, we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bullshit. (Laughter.) We then went through the Mueller report. And they should have come back one day later. They didn't. They came back two years later, after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money. People came to Washington to help other people. \"Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,\" I say. They came , one or two or three people in particular, but many people. We had a rough campaign. It was nasty. It was one of the nastiest, they say. They say Andrew Jackson was always the nastiest campaign. They actually said we topped it. (Laughter.) It was a nasty , it was a nasty , both in the primaries and in the , in the election. But, you see, we thought, after the election, it would stop. But it didn't stop; it just started. And tremendous corruption. Tremendous corruption. So we had a campaign. Little did we know we were running against some very, very bad and evil people with fake dossiers, with all of these horrible, dirty cops that took these dossiers and did bad things. They knew all about it. The FISA courts should be ashamed of themselves. It's a very tough thing. And then we ended up winning on Russia, Russia, Russia. It should have taken the one day, as I said, and it took years. Then Bob Mueller testified. That didn't work out so well for the other side. (Laughter.) But they should have said, that first week , because it came out. Is that right, Jim Jordan? They knew in the first two days actually. Devin, is that right? Two days. They knew that we were totally innocent. But they kept it going, Mark. They kept it going forever because they wanted to inflict political pain on somebody that had just won an election that, to , a lot of people were surprised. I mean, we had polls that said we were going to win. We had Los Angeles Times and a few , a few papers, actually, said it was , we were going to win but it was going to be close. And we did win. It was one of the greatest wins of all time. And they said, \"Okay, he won.\" And, you know, I wrote this down because that was where a thing called the \"insurance policy\" , to me, when I saw the insurance policy , and that was done long before the election. That was done when they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win. And, by the way, Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for millions , millions of dollars , the fake dossier. And now Christopher Steele admits that it's a fake because he got sued by rich people. I should have sued him too. But when you're President, people don't like suing. I want to thank my legal team, by the way , not for that advice, but for other advice. (Applause.) Pat, Jay. Pat. You guys stand up, please. (Applause.) Great job. (Applause.) Right at the beginning, they said, \"Sir, you have nothing to worry about. All of the facts are on your side.\" I said, \"You don't understand. That doesn't matter. That doesn't matter.\" And that was really true. They made up facts. A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president. He brought it out of thin air. Just made it up. They say he's a screenwriter , a failed screenwriter. He tried to go into , unfortunately, he went into politics after that. (Laughter.) Remember he said the statement, which is a mob statement: \"Don't call me. I'll call you.\" I didn't say that. Fortunately, for all of us here today and for our country, we had transcripts. We had transcribers , professional transcribers. Then they said, \"Oh, well, maybe the transcription is not correct.\" But Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother , right? , we had some people that , really amazing. But we did everything. We said, \"What's wrong with it?\" \"Well, they didn't add this word or that one.\" It didn't matter. I said, \"Add it. They're probably wrong, but add it.\" So now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate. When you read those transcripts, Tim Scott , I don't know if Tim is here, but he said, \"Sir \" He was the first one to call me. \"Sir, I read the transcript. You did nothing wrong.\" And, Mitch, he stayed there, right from the beginning. He never changed. And, Mitch McConnell, I want to tell you: You did a fantastic job. (Applause.) Somebody said, \"You know, Mitch is quiet.\" I said, \"He's not quiet. He's not quiet.\" These are the , he doesn't want people to know him. And they said, \"Is Mitch smart?\" I said, \"Well, let's put it this way: For many, many years, a lot of very smart , bad, in many cases, sometimes good , but people have been trying to take his place. And to the best of my knowledge, I've never even heard the subject come up, because they've been wiped out so fast. (Laughter.) This guy is great, and I appreciate it, Mitch. (Applause.) And he's also given us 191 now. (Applause.) A hundred and ninety-one federal judges. Two Supreme Court judges, right? It's up to 191. (Applause.) True. Great guy. Great guy. He's a tough guy to read. I'm good at reading people. A tough guy to read. I'd call him. My wife would say, \"How did you do with Mitch?\" \"Uhh, I don't know.\" (Laughter.) That's what makes him good , when you can read somebody. Fantastic job. And he understood, rightfully, that this was crooked politics. This was crooked politics. How about all these people, they're running for office. They're saying the worst things about me, like eight senators on the Democrat side. Most of them got wiped out. You know, they got their 1 percent or less. Most of them got less. They decided to go home. \"Let's go back to California.\" Let's go back to wherever they came from. \"Let's go back to New York.\" How about that one? Our New York senator, Gillibrand. \"Let's go back to New York,\" after they get nothing. And then they take an oath that they will be fair, that they will be reason- , and all of the different things. And they had to sign. They're not fair. But here's the beauty: So we have four left. They're saying the most horrendous things about me. It's okay, it's politics. And then they're supposed to vote , on me. They're trying to replace me, and then they're supposed to be voting. So I think it's , I mean, I think it's incredible. But , so, Mitch, I want to thank you very much. Incredible. And you have some of your folks here, and they're incredible people , and they've been, right from the beginning. And, again, you're out of session. Unfortunately, I didn't , you know, I only told these folks, \"Let's do this today.\" We did a prayer breakfast this morning, and I thought that was really good. In fact, that was so good it might wipe this out. But by the end , by the time we finished this, we'll wipe that one out , those statements. (Laughter.) I had , I had Nancy Pelosi sitting four seats away, and I'm saying things that a lot of people wouldn't have said , (laughter) , but I meant every , (laughter) , I meant every word of it. But we have some of the folks that are going to be leaving right after this, and they work hard , and they did work hard. Bill Cassidy, Senator. Stand up, Bill. What a guy. (Applause.) Great man. When I need to know about health insurance and preexisting conditions and individual mandates, I call Bill or I call Barrasso. We get those two guys; they know more than anybody. A man who just became a senator , he's a little bit like me; we have a couple of them. A very successful guy in business, and he said, \"What the hell, I'll run for the Senate\" , from Indiana. And he ran. And I saw him on television, destroying his opponent in a debate. I said, \"You know, this guy could win.\" And I got behind him. And, Mike Braun, you have done some great job. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Tough. Tough. Thank you. A man who got James Comey to choke, and he was just talking in his regular voice. He is the roughest man. He's actually an unbelievable , and I appreciate the letter you sent me today. I just got it. But he's got this voice that scares people. (Laughter.) You know, people from Iowa can be very tough. We're doing very well in Iowa. But I'll tell you, Chuck Grassley , he's looking at Comey: \"Well, you tell me, what did you say?\" (Laughter.) Now, he wasn't being rough. That was just the way he talked. (Laughter.) And that was when Comey , I think that was when Comey announced that he was leaking, lying, and everything else, right? He choked because he never heard anybody talk like that. (Laughter.) You know, you should have gone , I wish you got angry. You could have gotten the whole ballgame. He would have said, \"I give up.\" (Laughter.) Chuck Grassley is an incredible guy. (Applause.) And a man who , you know, he was running against a tough, smart campaign and we learned how good she was, right? She was a great campaigner. In fact, by the end of the campaign, she was actually , I thought she was more for me than you were, Josh. I was worried. (Laughter.) I saw her ad; she was saying the greatest things about me. And you know who I'm talking about. And I went to a great place , Missouri , and I said, \"Who do you have to beat her?\" And they said, \"Well, we have four people.\" I said, \"Let me see them. I'm got to interview \" , can you imagine? I'm interviewing people for the United States Senate. This is what I do. Where have I gone? But I love it. I love it because we're getting great people. The first one I met was Josh Hawley. After about 10 minutes, I said to the people, \"Don't show me anybody else. This is the guy.\" He was the attorney general. Did a phenomenal job in the state. Highly respected. And , Claire McCaskill. So, the theory was you couldn't beat her. Great campaigner. Remember the last campaign, she was going to be taken out. She was always going to be taken out, then she wins and people say, \"How did that happen?\" Didn't happen with him. But she got so friendly toward me. In fact, one of the ads I still have. I'm putting it in the archives as one of the best ads I've ever made. (Laughter.) And she tried to convince people that we were best friends. But Josh ended up winning by five or six points. You were unbelievable. You were tough. And you are something. And one of the greatest supporters on the impeachment hoax was Josh Hawley. He was incensed actually; I watched it. He was incensed at what they were doing and what they were saying. And those were the ones , you know, I had some that said, \"Oh, I wish you didn't make the call.\" And that's okay, if they need that. It's incorrect. It's totally incorrect. And then you have some that used religion as a crutch. They never used it before. An article written today: \"Never heard him use it before.\" But today, you know, it's one of those things. But, you know, it's a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for President. But, Josh Hawley, I want to thank you. You were right from the beginning. Man, did I make a good choice. (Applause.) Thank you, Josh. Tremendous future. A man who is brilliant and who actually was deceived, to an extent, comes from a great state, Utah, where my poll numbers have gone through the roof. And one of the senators' poll numbers, and not this one, went down big. You saw that. You saw that, Mike? But Mike Lee is a brilliant guy. He's difficult. (Laughter.) Whenever I sign bills , you know, we do sign a lot of legislation that's , it's big and it's powerful, but it's sort of everybody has to approve it. And I see 99 to 1 , (laughter) , 99 to 1. I say, \"Don't tell me who's the one.\" (Laughter.) \"Is it Mike?\" \"Yes.\" (Laughter.) And he always has a good reason for it too, by the way. But he is , he's incredible. And right at the beginning, he knew we were right, Mike, and I appreciate it very much. You're just fantastic. And say hello to the people of Utah and tell them, \"I'm sorry about Mitt Romney. I'm sorry.\" (Laughter and applause.) Okay? We can say that Mike Lee is, by far, the most popular senator from the state. But you've done a fantastic job, Mike, in many ways. In many ways. A young woman who I didn't know at all, but she's been so supportive , and I've had great support from other people in that state. And she's been so supportive, and she's been downright nasty and mean about the unfairness to the President. And Kelly Loeffler, I appreciate very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Great. She saw it very early on, and we have , I don't know if we have other senators here, but we got a hell of a lot of congressmen. And I'll go over them quickly, but they have , they have also been , you know, it helped when we won 197 to nothing. That's got to be a first, Kevin. Right? Is that, like, a first? The Republicans have this image. See, I say Democrats are lousy politicians because they have lousy policy: open borders, sanctuary cities. They have horrible policy. Who the hell can win? Oh, their new policy is: Raise taxes. They want to raise taxes. You know, all my life, I wasn't in politics, but I'd say, if you're a politician, you want to say, \"We're going to lower taxes.\" They want to raise taxes. So they have open borders, sanctuary cities. \"Raise everybody's taxes. Get rid of everybody's healthcare.\" A hundred and eighty million people in the United States. And they're really happy. \"And we're going to give you a healthcare that's going to cost more money than the country could make in 30 years if it really does well.\" That's one year. So I've always said they're lousy politicians, but they do two things: They are vicious and mean. Vicious. These people are vicious. Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. And she wanted to impeach a long time ago. When she said, \"I pray for the President. I pray for the \" , she doesn't pray. She may pray, but she prays for the opposite. (Laughter.) But I doubt she prays at all. And these are vicious people, but they do two things: They stick together, historically. I'm not talking now. They stick together like glue. That's how they impeached, because they had whatever the number is , 220 people. So if they don't lose anybody, they'll be able to impeach anybody. You could be George Washington. You could have just won the war, and they say, \"Let's get him out of office.\" And they stuck together, and they're vicious as hell. And they'll probably come back for more, but maybe not because the Republican Party's poll numbers, Mitch, have now gone up more than any time, I think, since 2004, 2005, and you know what happened then. But in normal times , decades, you would call it; that was a little unusual time; it was for a very short period , the Republicans [sic] Party , Party's poll numbers and Donald Trump's poll numbers are the highest I've ever had them. So maybe they were. It's no way to get your poll numbers up. It's not worth it , because from my family's standpoint, it's been very unfair for my family. It's been very unfair to the country. Think of it. A phone call. A very good phone call. I know bad phone calls. This is a phone call with many people. I think Mike Pompeo was probably on the call. Where is Mike? Mike Pompeo was on the call. Many people were on the call. I know there were many people. They even have \"apprenti,\" bringing up an old favorite word of mine. \"The Apprentice.\" They have \"apprenti.\" They have people on these calls. And I know there are many. When I speak to the head of a nation , and they have many people on. I mean, also on , do you think they just , in the case of Ukraine, he's a new president, seems like a very nice person, by the way. His whole thing was corruption. He's going to stop corruption. We even have a treaty , 2001, 1999. It's a treaty , signed treaty , that we will work together to root out corruption in Ukraine. I probably have a legal obligation, Mr. Attorney, to report corruption. But they don't think it's corrupt when a son that made no money, that got thrown out of the military, that had no money at all, is working for $3 million up front, $83,000 a month. And that's only Ukraine. Then goes to China, picks up $1.5 billion. Then goes to Romania, I hear, and many other countries. They think that's okay? Because if it is , is Ivanka in the audience? Is Ivanka here? Boy, my kids could make a fortune. (Laughter.) They could make a fortune. It's corrupt. But it's not even that; it's just general corruption. And the other thing, as mentioned in the call and something that I've told Mike Pence, our great Vice President , I would tell him all the time, and I told him when he went on the trip, because he was over there. He never mentioned anything about this when you had your meeting. It's a terrible thing. But I told Mike. I said, \"Mike, we're giving them money, and, you know, you're always torn about that because we have our country to build, we have our cities to build and our roads to fix. But we're giving them money. Tell me, why isn't Germany paying money? Why isn't France? Why isn't United Kingdom paying money? Why aren't they paying money? Why are we paying them money?\" Is that a correct statement, Mike? I say, \"Find out what the hell is going on.\" And I told that to all of my people, OMB. I said , I asked that question: \"How much is Germany paying? Why isn't Germany paying?\" Why is the United States always the sucker? Because we're a bunch of suckers. But that's turning around fast. But it makes it harder when stuff like this happens, because you want to focus, and you want to focus perfectly. Think what we could have done if the same energy was put into infrastructure, prescription drug prices. Think of what we could have done. And I'm now talking both sides. Think of what we could have done if we had the same genius , because it's genius. I will say, it's genius on the other side , maybe even more so because they took nothing and brought me to a final vote of impeachment. That's a very ugly word to me. It's a very dark word. Very ugly. They took nothing. They took a phone call that was a totally appropriate call. I call it a \"perfect call\" because it was. And they brought me to the final stages of impeachment. But now we have that gorgeous word , I never thought a word would sound so good. It's called \"total acquittal.\" (Applause.) Total acquittal. So , so I want to, if I could, real fast, just introduce a few of the people. I have to start with , I have to start with Kevin. Man, did you do a job. Lucky you're there. Lucky you're there because it wouldn't have worked out. If you don't have the right people , I'll tell you, Kevin McCarthy has done an incredible job. (Applause.) Really. Stand up. And he loves this job, and he loves this country. I'll tell you what: Mitch and Kevin, they love what they do. Now, Mitch wouldn't even tell you he liked it. (Laughter.) I'd say, \"Mitch, do you like it?\" \"I don't know.\" (Laughter.) He's the greatest poker player, right? Kevin will say, \"I love it.\" Right? And I will say that you're going to be Speaker of the House because of this impeachment hoax. (Applause.) I really believe it. I really believe it. And I'm going to work hard on it. I'm going to try and get out to those Trump , those Trump areas that we won by a lot. And, you know, in '18, we didn't win. We just won two seats in North Carolina , two wonderful seats in North Carolina that were not supposed to be won. But I went and I made speeches, and we had rallies, and we did a great job and we won. We took two seats. Nobody writes about that. If we lost them, it would have been the biggest story of the year. But we're going to go, we're going to do a job, and we're going to win a lot of seats. We're going to win a lot of seats. People are very angry that Nancy Pelosi and all of these guys , I mean, Nadler , I know him much of my life; he's fought me in New York for 25 years. I always beat him. And I had to beat him another time. And I'll probably have to beat him again. Because if they find that I happen to walk across the street, and maybe go against the light or something, \"Let's impeach him.\" (Laughter.) So we'll probably have to do it again because these people have gone stone-cold crazy. But I've beaten them all my life, and I'll beat them again if I have to. (Applause.) But what they're doing is very unfair. Very unfair. So Kevin McCarthy has been great. So, a few names, right? And there'll be a few you forget. If you want, you can raise and I'll say, \"Great. Love to have you. Wonderful.\" (Laughter.) But we're going to do the best we can. And I have my Cabinet, but my Cabinet is different , I appoint them. Okay? I didn't see all of them helping so much. (Laughter.) You know, they were running their various bureaucracies, right? (Laughter.) No, my Cabinet is great, and they're all here. But today is the day to celebrate these great warriors, right? These are great warriors. They really fought hard for us. And , So I'll start: Kelly Armstrong, North Dakota. Kelly, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) Great job. Jim Banks of Indiana. Jim, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) Andy Biggs. Where is Andy? Boy, oh, boy, Andy. He got , (applause) , there's a guy. He's tough. I hear we're doing well in Arizona, huh? It's going good, yeah? I think so. I think I saw a poll that was very good for me. I think we have to make sure Martha is going to do , I think Martha is going to do good. But we have some states that are going to be not easy, but Arizona has been great. And we're stopping illegal aliens from coming in. We're putting up walls. New Mexico, too, a state that's never been in play for Republicans, is totally in play. Right? Nevada is really looking good. We're doing well. We're doing well. We're going to have a great , there's more spirit. I will say this: There's more spirit now for the Republican Party, by far, than the Democrats. You know, Mike Pence just got back from a place , a beautiful place that Chuck Grassley knows well: Iowa. And he was talking about these fiasco , the Democrats, they can't count some simple votes, and yet they want to take over your healthcare system. Think of that. (Laughter.) No, think of it. But we also had an election out there, and we got 98 percent of the vote. We have two people running, you know, and I guess they consider them non-people, but they are running. I mean, one was a governor. One was a congressman. They're running. We got 98 percent of the vote. And everybody from the media was saying, \"Who are those crowds over there?\" You know, they expect it to be one of these competitive , where everybody is running because they want to win, they want to win. And it was Trump. Right, Mark Meadows? It was Trump. This was a Trump crowd. And a lot of , actually, a lot of my guys went there. They went to Iowa. And a lot of friends went there, and we had tremendous , they say the spirit , the spirit for the Republican Party right now is stronger, I think, than it's ever been in the history of our country. I think it's stronger than it's ever been. (Applause.) And that includes Honest Abe Lincoln. You know, a lot of people forget Abe Lincoln. I wish he were here. I'd give him one hell of an introduction. Right? (Laughter.) But he was , he was a Republican. Abe Lincoln. Honest Abe. Bradley Byrne, Alabama. What a great place. (Applause.) Thank you, Bradley. A man who has been an unbelievable friend of mine and spokesman, and somebody that , that I really like. And I know, Kelly, you're going to end up liking him a lot. Something is going to happen that's going to be very good. I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet. But Doug Collins , where is he? Where is Doug? (Applause.) You have been so great. Thank you very much, Doug. Thank you very much. Thank you. Really amazing job. A young man who is , born with a great gene, because I know his father and how great a politician he was. But he's from Florida. Sometimes controversial, but actually, he's not controversial. He's solid as a rock and he's a friend of mine. Matt Gaetz. Matt? (Applause.) Thank you, Matt. Thank you. Great job. All right, this guy. So he's the NCAA , meaning, a couple of years ago, when he was in college , wrestling champion. NCAA. That's the big deal. That means, in all of college, you're the champ, you're the best. His record was ridiculous. Nobody would , nobody could beat him. And I see it. You know, every time, I see it. When I first got to know him , Jim Jordan , when I first got to know Jim, I said, \"Huh, he never wears a jacket. What the hell is going on?\" (Laughter.) He's obviously very proud of his body. (Laughter and applause.) And they say where he works out , you know, where the congressmen, senators, they work out , they say, when Jim works out , even though he's not as young as he was, but he works out , the machine starts burning. You know, it's just a different form of a workout than us. Right, Sonny? And , there he is. Look at that guy. But one day I'm looking, and he looks tough. And I'm looking, and I'm looking at those ears. And I say, \"Those ears have something going on there.\" I said, \"Did you ever wrestle?\" \"Yeah, I did.\" But he doesn't talk. But I checked. This guy was a world , this guy was a champion, top, top wrestler. And when I had the top , I had all of the teams. And, by the way, your Super Bowl champions are coming, I think next week or soon. Very soon. And every one of them want to be here. (Applause.) And the coach loves us. The coach is great. Andy Reid. And every one of them want to be here. We have , people love it. But we had all of the NCAA championship teams here. They had the golf, the basketball. They had every team here. And one of the teams was wrestling. The wrestling team. Was that Penn State? And Penn State won the title. They have a great team. And I walked up with Jim, and it's like I didn't exist. (Laughter.) Those wrestlers, they grabbed him. They love Jim Jordan, and we love you too because you are some warrior. (Applause.) True. True. A woman who became a star , we have a couple of women that became stars. You two. And I always liked the name of her , you know, I liked the name, \"Lesko.\" I liked it. That's how I picked it. I liked the name. I saw that face. I saw that everything. They gave me cards. She had like seven opponents, right? And you have no idea how much the public appreciates how smart, how sharp you are. This I can't tell. I can't tell. They just said, \"You know, she's really good. She's really talented.\" And I said, \"Let's go.\" We worked with her. She won her race. Tough race. It's no longer tough. Because what she does out there is incredible. Arizona loves her. But you were so incredible, representing , I don't say \"me\" , representing our country and getting it out of this impeachment hoax. What you did was incredible. So, Debbie, please stand up. Debbie Lesko. (Applause.) A man who I , I became very friendly with , I don't know why. Do you ever have where , I'll ask the media: If certain people call, you take their calls. Other people call , if they don't have information, they won't take anybody's call. But other people call, and you don't. This is a guy , he just , he's just a very special guy. His wife I actually like better than him, to be honest. (Laughter.) Because he doesn't know that I know that he didn't actually support me right from the beginning, but she did. (Laughter.) And on my worst day , right? , on my worst day, my worst , I won't tell you why it was my worst, but it was not one of those good days , she got on a bus, got many other buses and women all over North Carolina, and they toured North Carolina. Well, Mark was back sort of semi-supporting another candidate, which he ended up leaving very quickly. I don't think you had a choice, because of your wife, but thank her. And Mark Meadows, he's an extraordinary guy. I mean, the only problem is, I guess, he's announcing , he'd only win by 40 points, but he's announcing that he'll be not running this time. Do you have somebody good to run? Somebody going to win your district by at least 20 points, please? Okay? But he's a tremendously talented man, not just as a politician. As a human being, he's incredible. And during these horrible times , I mean, the way he worked and Jim and all of you guys , the way they worked so , it was like their life was at stake. So many. Ron DeSantis is another one. He worked so hard. Then he called me. He said, \"Sir, I'd like to run for governor.\" I said, \"Governor? I don't want you to run. I like you staying.\" \"No, I want to run for governor.\" And I said, \"Well, if you have to.\" \"I'd like your support.\" I said, \"How can I support you? You're at three.\" He was at three. He had no money. Somebody was at 38 and they had $22 million cash, right? I said, \"Look, if it's important, I'll do it,\" because they , he's been another great warrior. And he's , by the way, he ran. I endorsed him. His numbers went through the roof. The man who we beat, who was expected to win easily, called me after the race. He said, \"You endorsed him, and it was like a nuclear bomb went off. There was nothing I could do.\" He never even spent his money. He saved it. But Ron DeSantis is another one, and now he's the governor of Florida. And, by the way, he's a great governor. He's a very popular governor. His numbers are in the 70s. And he's done a great job. But, Mark, I want to thank you very much. Fantastic job. Thank you very much. Mark Meadows. (Applause.) And Mike Johnson of Louisiana. Where's Mike? Central casting. What a job. You can represent me anytime. (Applause.) You can represent me anytime. Thank you. What a job you've done. Thank you, Mike. And a man nobody has ever heard of, except the other side. He's the other side's worst nightmare. This guy goes down into dungeons and basements; he'll find a document, no matter what. He's the most legitimate human being. He's the hardest worker. He's unbelievable. He took tremendous abuse. I mean, abuse. The , the media and, you know, the other side, and the bad ones, the leakers, the liars, the dirty cops , they wanted to destroy him. They tried. They got close, but he wouldn't let it happen. And, honestly, in a certain way, he was the first one. Wouldn't you say, Jim and Mark and everybody? This was the first guy. He came out of nowhere. He's saying, \"These people are corrupt.\" He's still saying it. And he was unbelievable. Devin Nunes. He was unbelievable. Unbelievable. (Applause.) That's so true, Devin. He'd come in and say , I didn't even know hi;, I just heard there were like , there was this congressman who kept going into a basement , into files. (Laughter.) He knew something was wrong. You felt it, right? And now we know a lot more than we knew then, right? You never thought it was as bad as it is. And hopefully we're going to take care of things, because we can never, ever allow this to happen again. (Applause.) Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. Scott, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Scott. Really great. And you're doing very well over there, by the way. Just saw your numbers.A man who is a , I mean, central casting. If I'm going to pick Perry Mason, I'm going to do a remake of Perry Mason , other than Bill Barr, I'd pick this guy. But I have to say, I'll pick Barr. I pick Barr first, right? (Laughter.) John Ratcliffe, right? But I have to tell you, if we're doing a remake of Perry Mason, the man I get , there's nobody in Hollywood like this , John Ratcliffe, right? (Applause.) Stand up, John. So , such a great lawyer. Incredible guy. Incredible talent. But just a great lawyer and we appreciate it. He gets on that screen, and everyone says, \"I agree.\" The other side folds up so fast. We'll probably be using a lot of you in the next year. But you have been fantastic, John. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. A man who's braver than me and braver than all of us in this room. He got , he got whacked. He got whacked. My Steve, right? I went to the hospital with our great First Lady that night. Right, honey? And we saw a man that was not going to make it. He was not going to make it. He was , the doctor , and I told him his wife , I said, \"She loves you.\" \"Why do you say that?\" Because she was devastated. A lot of wives wouldn't give a damn. (Laughter.) A lot of , a lot of wives , a lot of wives would have said, \"Oh, yeah.\" I said, \"How's he doing?\" \"Oh \" She couldn't even talk. She was inconsolable. Most wives would say, \"Not good. Listen, I'm going home now.\" (Laughter.) But the doctor came in , the wife is like , she was a total mess. She was really devastated. And he really , it looked like he had a 20, 25 percent chance. I think you set a record for blood loss. And, Steve Scalise, I , actually, honestly, I think you're better looking now. You're more handsome now. (Laughter.) You , you weren't that good looking. You look good now. (Laughter.) He looks better now. Can you believe it? I don't know what the hell that is. (Applause.) It's true. Better now. (Applause.) What a guy. And he was practicing , he was practicing for the baseball game against, I guess, the Democrats, right? And this whack-job started shooting. Hurt Roger , I don't know if Roger is here. But hurt a number of people , hit them. But really hit Steve. He , Steve was at second base. He was the second baseman. And he went down and it was terrible. I mean, I saw the whole thing and it was terrible. Fortunately, you had two brave policemen with you. Because of your high position in Congress, you had two policemen and they were amazing , the man and a woman. And they came and they didn't have rifles. They were against a, supposedly, pretty good sharpshooter with rifles , good equipment. And all they had was a gun. And they started coming in from the outfield, shooting. And they're so far away that a handgun is not preferred. This guy has the rifle and he's hitting people. And he was going to move up and there was no out. I mean, if he would have been able to move up, there was no way to get out. The entrance was a single entranceway on the other side, where he was. So everyone went into the dugout , ran into the dugout, but Steve was really hit badly in the stomach, and , with a bullet that rips you apart. It was supposed to do that. It rips , it rips you apart. And these two people came charging forward. Boom. Boom. Boom. And one of them , you know who , one of them , him? , got the shooter. Hit him. And then got him. Killed him from the long distance. It was amazing. If you didn't have those two people , you can imagine, right? You could imagine what would happen. So Melania and I went to the hospital that night. And he was in such bad shape, and he's been working ever since, so hard. But six months ago, they had a baseball game at the Nationals Park. And I'm watching and it's , it's on television. And it's just, you know, a game. People , you want to win it, right? And Steve's at second base. The poor guy can't even walk. Do you remember Bobby Richardson for the New York Yankees? He was known for range, Louie. Range. He had the greatest range. If a ball is hit to shortstop , Bobby Richardson is the second player, the second baseman , Bobby Richardson would field the ball. If it's hit to first base, he'll throw it to the first baseman. He had unbelievable range. This was not Steve Scalise. (Laughter.) Steve had no range. (Laughter.) One foot and he has to fall down, right? Because, you know, he was trying to get better. I don't know who the hell put you on the field. (Laughter.) And this is a true story. So the game starts and the first pitch , Steve is standing at second base and the guy is really in bad shape. And I said, \"This is terrible.\" A shot , groundball shot is hit to second and Steve. I say , I didn't have time to think too much, but I said, \"This is not good. That ball is going toward him.\" And this guy stopped that ball, caught the call. He's now laying down. He throws the ball to first base. He gets him out. I said, \"It's the most incredible thing.\" I've never seen , athletically , (applause) , I've never seen anything like it, right? And he gets him out and they then took him out of the game, which was a very wise thing because you could never do that again in a million years. (Laughter.) But you weren't going to let that ball go through. I don't care if it was hit by the greatest of all time, right? That ball was not going through you, because you are a warrior. Steve is , he is fantastic. You are fantastic. You and Liz and Kevin. What a great , what a group. I mean, what a group. I got lucky. I got lucky because you need the right people. If I had the wrong people there, he , maybe a different story. Maybe we'd be celebrating something else. But I really want to thank you, Steve Scalise. And, Elise, you , I just read this story; she's the most incredible , what's going on with you, Elise. So I even said , you know, I was up campaigning for her, helping her. But I thought, \"She looks good. She looks like good talent.\" But did I not realize, when she opens that mouth, you were killing them, Elise. (Laughter.) You were killing them. (Applause.) Elise , and there's a big story in the New York Post , I love the New York Post because they treat me well. There aren't too many of you that do. But today, you're treating me well. I even had a great headline , New York Times, Washington Post. I had all of these great headlines. Maybe we should just end it right there. (Laughter.) But you had the greatest story, yesterday in the Post, that people from all over the country are contributing to her campaign. They were so enthralled with the way you handled yourself, what you said, the way you said it. And I'll always be your friend. I think it was , it's really an amazing story. What a great future you have. What a great future. Thank you. (Applause.) The First Lady agrees, by the way. The First Lady agrees. And Michael Turner, you can represent me anytime. Where's Michael? Where is he? (Applause.) Or you can represent me. How good were you? There's another , there's another Perry Mason type, I think. Right? What do you think, John? But, Michael, you were fantastic and we appreciate it. Brad Wenstrup. Where's Brad? Brad. (Applause.) Great, great job. This is a big day for lawyers. You notice only the lawyers stayed? All the lawyers stayed behind. Lee Zeldin. How good are you? How good are you? (Applause.) Man. And, Louie, your name is not down. They didn't give me your name. Do you know , if I didn't announce Louie , (laughter) , whoever the hell made this list, I got to get rid of because I , if I wouldn't have announced Louie, it might have been the end of the presidency. (Laughter.) Louie, you have been so great. So tough and so smart. I got it just , (laughs) , I got it. But Louie has been amazing. He's a tough guy. He's a smart guy. He's streetwise like crazy. We love Texas, and we're with you all the way, Louie. We're with you all the way. Thank you very much. (Applause.) So that's the story. We have a great group of warriors, and there are others left, and, I guess, probably, I'm sure I didn't mention a few, and I apologize if that's the case. How's CPAC doing? Good? Huh? My man, stand up please, will you? He's the one who said, \"You should run.\" (Applause.) Right? Matt said , it's like five years ago, six years ago. And I made a speech, and then they do some kind of a straw poll: \"Who made the best speech?\" And he said, \"I made the best speech.\" With all this professional , I hate to say this: With all these professional politicians, they voted, by far, the best speech was Trump. He calls me, he says, \"You should run for politics.\" I say, \"What do I know about politics?\" But you know what? We learned quickly, and our country has never done better than it's doing right now. (Applause.) So it's been good. (Applause.) But thank you, Matt. Great. Say hello. So that's the story. We've been treated very unfairly. Fortunately, we have great men and women that came to our defense. If we didn't, this would have been a horrific incident for our country. When you have Lisa and Peter, the lovers, the FBI lovers: \"I want to believe the path you threw out for\" Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. That's the office. \"There's no way he gets elected\" , meaning me. \"There's no way he gets elected.\" This is Peter, to Lisa. He's probably trying to impress her, for obvious reasons. (Laughter.) \"There's no way he gets elected. But I'm afraid we can't take the risk.\" Now, think of this. In other words, if I get elected, they can't , \"they\"; two low-lifes , they can't take the risk. They can't take the risk. Think of it. And that's where it came up, the greatest word of all: \"insurance policy.\" So he says, \"But I'm afraid we can't take the risk. She may lose.\" It's like an insurance policy. In the unlikely event you die before you're 40 , in other words, if I won, they were going to do exactly what they did to us. They were going to try and overthrow the government of the United States , a duly elected president. And if I didn't fire James Comey, we would have never found this stuff. Because when I fired that sleazebag, all hell broke out. They were ratting on each other. They were running for the hills. Let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. It's in the hands of some very talented people. We're going to have to see what happens. But I can tell you, in my opinion, these are the crookedest, most dishonest, dirtiest people I've ever seen. They said , this is Strzok: \"God, Hillary should win 100 million to one.\" This is about me. This is an agent from the FBI. Look how they let her off. Thirty-three thousand emails deleted. Nothing happens to her. Nothing happens. It's unbelievable. But think of that , \"God, Hillary should win\" , when these guys are investigating Hillary. Then they go to work for Mueller , the two of them , and when Muller found out that everybody knew that they were 100 percent this way, he let them go. But they deleted all of their emails and text messages. So when we got the phone, they were all deleted. Could you imagine the treasure trove? They illegally deleted. So they left. They left Bob Mueller. He had the look, but he didn't have a lot of other things. Always had the look. Mr. G-Man. And I love the FBI and the FBI loves me , 99 percent. It was the top scum. And the FBI people don't like the top scum. So think of that: 100 million to one. And he's investigating me. And then, \"God, Trump is a loathsome human being, isn't he?\" These are the people looking at me. I'm really not a bad person. And Page said, \"Yes, he's awful.\" How would you like to have that? This is just , this is the good stuff. There's stuff a hundred times worse than that. These are all dirty people. And now, I just heard that they're suing the United States of America because they were interfered with. We're not going to let it happen. Just not going to let it happen. We cannot let this happen to our country. We can't. (Applause.) So, I'm going to leave now. And I don't know if any of you have anything to say. You could say it. But this is sort of a day of celebration, because we went through hell. And I'm sure that Pelosi and Cryin' Chuck , I've known this guy all the , the only time I ever saw him cry was when it was appropriate. Known him for a long time. Cryin' Chuck. But I'm sure they'll try and cook up other things. They'll go through the state of New York. They'll go through other places. They'll do whatever they can. Because instead of wanting to heal our country and fix our country, all they want to do , in my opinion, it's almost like they want to destroy our country. We can't let it happen. Jim Jordan, did you want to say something? Go ahead. Huh? Mark? REPRESENTATIVE MEADOWS: No, I just , I wanted to just say that this reflection today, it is a small reflection of the kind of support you have all across the country. We've got your back. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) This was a highly partisan situation. Pelosi said , I copied it down exactly. Before the impeachment , she wanted to impeach from day one, by the way. Don't let it fool you. You know, she said, \"No, the impeachment is a very serious thing.\" I said, \"She wants to impeach. Watch.\" Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan , bipartisan. It was 197 to nothing. And other than one failed presidential candidate , and I call that \"half a vote\" because he actually voted for us on the other one. But we had one failed presidential candidate. That's the only half a vote we lost. So, we had almost 53 to nothing. We had 197 to nothing. And the only one that voted against was a guy that can't stand the fact that he ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of the presidency. But she said, \"There's something so compelling , it has to be so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan. I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country\" , she was right about that , \"and it's just not worth it.\" That was Nancy Pelosi a year ago. Right? And I think it's a shame. I think it's a shame. But as I said, if we can put this genius to work on roads and highways and bridges and all of the things we can do , prescription drugs. You know, we had , Secretary Azar is here and I want to thank him for this, but we had , first time in 51 years, where drug prices actually came down last year. First time in 51 years. But what we can do, working with both parties in Congress, is , would be unbelievable. It would be unbelievable , all we can do. And I know Chuck Grassley is working very hard on it and Mitch is working very hard on it. But what we can do is , is incredible. What we can do, just generally. We've done so much without it. We've rebuilt our military. We've cut regulations at a level that nobody thought possible. We'll always protect our Second Amendment; we all know that. But I just want to tell you that it's an honor to be with you all. I want to apologize to my family for having them have to go through a phony, rotten deal by some very evil and sick people. And Ivanka is here, and my , my sons and my whole family, and that includes Barron. (Applause.) That includes Barron, who is up there as a young boy. Stand up, honey. (Applause.) Ivanka, thank you, honey. Come. Come. (Applause.) (The President hugs Ivanka Trump.) Come here, baby. (Applause.) (The President hugs the First Lady.) So I just want to thank my family for sticking through it. This was not part of the deal. I was going to run for President, and if I won, I was going do a great job. I didn't know that I was going to run, and then when I got in, I was going to have to run again and again and again. Every week, I had to run again. That wasn't the deal, but they stuck with me. And I'm so glad I did it because we are making progress and doing things for our great people that everybody said couldn't be done. Our country is thriving. Our country is just respected again. And it's an honor to be with the people in this room. Thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) END 1:23 P.M. EST","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1399373\/remarks-by-president-trump-to-the-nation&speechType=1","Summary":"Executive Branch Legislative Branch","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-nation\/","CleanText":"Well, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Wow. (Applause.) Well, thank you very much, everybody. Wow. We've all been through a lot together, and we probably deserve that hand for all of us, because it's been a very unfair situation. I invited some of our very good friends. And we have limited room, but everybody wanted to come. We kept it down to a minimum. And believe it or not, this is a minimum. But a tremendous thing was done over the last number of months, but really, if you go back to it, over the last number of years. We had the witch hunt. It started from the day we came down the elevator, myself and our future First Lady, who's with us right now. Thank you, Melania. (Applause.) And it never really stopped. We've been going through this now for over three years. It was evil. It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars. And this should never, ever happen to another President ever. I don't know that other Presidents would have been able to take it. Some people said, no, they wouldn't have. But I can tell you, at a minimum, you have to focus on this because it can get away very quickly. No matter who you have with you, it can get away very quickly. It was a disgrace. Had I not fired James Comey , who was a disaster, by the way , it's possible I wouldn't even be standing here right now. We caught him in the act. Dirty cops. Bad people. If this happened to President Obama, a lot of people would have been in jail for a long time already. Many, many years. I want to start by thanking some of , and I call them friends, because, you know, you develop friendships and relationships when you're in battle and war, much more so than, 'Gee, let's have a normal situation.' With all that we've gone through, we've done, I think, more than any President and administration, and really, I say, for the most part, Republican congressmen, congresswomen, and Republican senators. We've done more than any administration in the first few years, if you look at all of the things we've done. I watched this morning as they tried to take credit for the stock market from , (laughter) , from , think of that. Let me tell you, if we didn't win, the stock market would have crashed. And the market was going up a lot before the election because it was looking we had a good chance to win, and then it went up tremendously from the time we won the election until the time we took office, which was November 8th to January 20th. And that's our credit. That's all our credit. And leading up to that point was our credit because there was hope. And one of the reasons the stock market has gone up so much in the last few days is people think we're doing so well. They liked the State of the Union speech. (Applause.) It really is , it's a true honor to give it. Making the State of the Union speech, I was with some people that have been around; they've been all over the world. And one of them, a highly sophisticated person, said, 'You know, no matter where you go in the world, it doesn't make any difference , there is nothing like what I witnessed tonight.' The beauty, the majesty of the Chamber. The power of the United States, the power of the people in this room. Really, an amazing , I don't think there is anything like that anywhere in the world. You can go to any other country, you can go to any other location, any other place. It's the beauty of everything. It's what it represents and how it represents our country. I want to start by introducing some of the people that are here. I know some are going to be left out. But they work so hard. And this is really not a news conference. It's not a speech. It's not anything. It's just we're sort of , it's a celebration, because we have something that just worked out. I mean, it worked out. We went through hell, unfairly. Did nothing wrong. Did nothing wrong. I've done things wrong in my life, I will admit. (Laughter.) Not purposely, but I've done things wrong. But this is what the end result is. (Applause.) (The President holds up the front cover of The Washington Post newspaper.) We can take that home, Honey. Maybe we'll frame it. (Laughter.) It's the only good headline I've ever had in the Washington Post, I'll tell you. (Laughter.) But every paper is the same. Does anybody have those papers? Does anybody have them? Because they're really like that. So I appreciate that. But some of the people here have been incredible warriors. They're warriors. And there's nothing, from a legal standpoint , this is a political thing. And every time, I'd say, 'This is unfair. Let's go to court.' They'd say, 'Sir, you can't go to court. This is politics.' And we were treated unbelievably unfairly. And you have to understand, we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bullshit. (Laughter.) We then went through the Mueller report. And they should have come back one day later. They didn't. They came back two years later, after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money. People came to Washington to help other people. 'Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,' I say. They came , one or two or three people in particular, but many people. We had a rough campaign. It was nasty. It was one of the nastiest, they say. They say Andrew Jackson was always the nastiest campaign. They actually said we topped it. (Laughter.) It was a nasty , it was a nasty , both in the primaries and in the , in the election. But, you see, we thought, after the election, it would stop. But it didn't stop; it just started. And tremendous corruption. Tremendous corruption. So we had a campaign. Little did we know we were running against some very, very bad and evil people with fake dossiers, with all of these horrible, dirty cops that took these dossiers and did bad things. They knew all about it. The FISA courts should be ashamed of themselves. It's a very tough thing. And then we ended up winning on Russia, Russia, Russia. It should have taken the one day, as I said, and it took years. Then Bob Mueller testified. That didn't work out so well for the other side. (Laughter.) But they should have said, that first week , because it came out. Is that right, Jim Jordan? They knew in the first two days actually. Devin, is that right? Two days. They knew that we were totally innocent. But they kept it going, Mark. They kept it going forever because they wanted to inflict political pain on somebody that had just won an election that, to , a lot of people were surprised. I mean, we had polls that said we were going to win. We had Los Angeles Times and a few , a few papers, actually, said it was , we were going to win but it was going to be close. And we did win. It was one of the greatest wins of all time. And they said, 'Okay, he won.' And, you know, I wrote this down because that was where a thing called the 'insurance policy' , to me, when I saw the insurance policy , and that was done long before the election. That was done when they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win. And, by the way, Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for millions , millions of dollars , the fake dossier. And now Christopher Steele admits that it's a fake because he got sued by rich people. I should have sued him too. But when you're President, people don't like suing. I want to thank my legal team, by the way , not for that advice, but for other advice. (Applause.) Pat, Jay. Pat. You guys stand up, please. (Applause.) Great job. (Applause.) Right at the beginning, they said, 'Sir, you have nothing to worry about. All of the facts are on your side.' I said, 'You don't understand. That doesn't matter. That doesn't matter.' And that was really true. They made up facts. A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president. He brought it out of thin air. Just made it up. They say he's a screenwriter , a failed screenwriter. He tried to go into , unfortunately, he went into politics after that. (Laughter.) Remember he said the statement, which is a mob statement: 'Don't call me. I'll call you.' I didn't say that. Fortunately, for all of us here today and for our country, we had transcripts. We had transcribers , professional transcribers. Then they said, 'Oh, well, maybe the transcription is not correct.' But Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother , right? , we had some people that , really amazing. But we did everything. We said, 'What's wrong with it?' 'Well, they didn't add this word or that one.' It didn't matter. I said, 'Add it. They're probably wrong, but add it.' So now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate. When you read those transcripts, Tim Scott , I don't know if Tim is here, but he said, 'Sir ' He was the first one to call me. 'Sir, I read the transcript. You did nothing wrong.' And, Mitch, he stayed there, right from the beginning. He never changed. And, Mitch McConnell, I want to tell you: You did a fantastic job. (Applause.) Somebody said, 'You know, Mitch is quiet.' I said, 'He's not quiet. He's not quiet.' These are the , he doesn't want people to know him. And they said, 'Is Mitch smart?' I said, 'Well, let's put it this way: For many, many years, a lot of very smart , bad, in many cases, sometimes good , but people have been trying to take his place. And to the best of my knowledge, I've never even heard the subject come up, because they've been wiped out so fast. (Laughter.) This guy is great, and I appreciate it, Mitch. (Applause.) And he's also given us 191 now. (Applause.) A hundred and ninety-one federal judges. Two Supreme Court judges, right? It's up to 191. (Applause.) True. Great guy. Great guy. He's a tough guy to read. I'm good at reading people. A tough guy to read. I'd call him. My wife would say, 'How did you do with Mitch?' 'Uhh, I don't know.' (Laughter.) That's what makes him good , when you can read somebody. Fantastic job. And he understood, rightfully, that this was crooked politics. This was crooked politics. How about all these people, they're running for office. They're saying the worst things about me, like eight senators on the Democrat side. Most of them got wiped out. You know, they got their 1 percent or less. Most of them got less. They decided to go home. 'Let's go back to California.' Let's go back to wherever they came from. 'Let's go back to New York.' How about that one? Our New York senator, Gillibrand. 'Let's go back to New York,' after they get nothing. And then they take an oath that they will be fair, that they will be reason- , and all of the different things. And they had to sign. They're not fair. But here's the beauty: So we have four left. They're saying the most horrendous things about me. It's okay, it's politics. And then they're supposed to vote , on me. They're trying to replace me, and then they're supposed to be voting. So I think it's , I mean, I think it's incredible. But , so, Mitch, I want to thank you very much. Incredible. And you have some of your folks here, and they're incredible people , and they've been, right from the beginning. And, again, you're out of session. Unfortunately, I didn't , you know, I only told these folks, 'Let's do this today.' We did a prayer breakfast this morning, and I thought that was really good. In fact, that was so good it might wipe this out. But by the end , by the time we finished this, we'll wipe that one out , those statements. (Laughter.) I had , I had Nancy Pelosi sitting four seats away, and I'm saying things that a lot of people wouldn't have said , (laughter) , but I meant every , (laughter) , I meant every word of it. But we have some of the folks that are going to be leaving right after this, and they work hard , and they did work hard. Bill Cassidy, Senator. Stand up, Bill. What a guy. (Applause.) Great man. When I need to know about health insurance and preexisting conditions and individual mandates, I call Bill or I call Barrasso. We get those two guys; they know more than anybody. A man who just became a senator , he's a little bit like me; we have a couple of them. A very successful guy in business, and he said, 'What the hell, I'll run for the Senate' , from Indiana. And he ran. And I saw him on television, destroying his opponent in a debate. I said, 'You know, this guy could win.' And I got behind him. And, Mike Braun, you have done some great job. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Tough. Tough. Thank you. A man who got James Comey to choke, and he was just talking in his regular voice. He is the roughest man. He's actually an unbelievable , and I appreciate the letter you sent me today. I just got it. But he's got this voice that scares people. (Laughter.) You know, people from Iowa can be very tough. We're doing very well in Iowa. But I'll tell you, Chuck Grassley , he's looking at Comey: 'Well, you tell me, what did you say?' (Laughter.) Now, he wasn't being rough. That was just the way he talked. (Laughter.) And that was when Comey , I think that was when Comey announced that he was leaking, lying, and everything else, right? He choked because he never heard anybody talk like that. (Laughter.) You know, you should have gone , I wish you got angry. You could have gotten the whole ballgame. He would have said, 'I give up.' (Laughter.) Chuck Grassley is an incredible guy. (Applause.) And a man who , you know, he was running against a tough, smart campaign and we learned how good she was, right? She was a great campaigner. In fact, by the end of the campaign, she was actually , I thought she was more for me than you were, Josh. I was worried. (Laughter.) I saw her ad; she was saying the greatest things about me. And you know who I'm talking about. And I went to a great place , Missouri , and I said, 'Who do you have to beat her?' And they said, 'Well, we have four people.' I said, 'Let me see them. I'm got to interview ' , can you imagine? I'm interviewing people for the United States Senate. This is what I do. Where have I gone? But I love it. I love it because we're getting great people. The first one I met was Josh Hawley. After about 10 minutes, I said to the people, 'Don't show me anybody else. This is the guy.' He was the attorney general. Did a phenomenal job in the state. Highly respected. And , Claire McCaskill. So, the theory was you couldn't beat her. Great campaigner. Remember the last campaign, she was going to be taken out. She was always going to be taken out, then she wins and people say, 'How did that happen?' Didn't happen with him. But she got so friendly toward me. In fact, one of the ads I still have. I'm putting it in the archives as one of the best ads I've ever made. (Laughter.) And she tried to convince people that we were best friends. But Josh ended up winning by five or six points. You were unbelievable. You were tough. And you are something. And one of the greatest supporters on the impeachment hoax was Josh Hawley. He was incensed actually; I watched it. He was incensed at what they were doing and what they were saying. And those were the ones , you know, I had some that said, 'Oh, I wish you didn't make the call.' And that's okay, if they need that. It's incorrect. It's totally incorrect. And then you have some that used religion as a crutch. They never used it before. An article written today: 'Never heard him use it before.' But today, you know, it's one of those things. But, you know, it's a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for President. But, Josh Hawley, I want to thank you. You were right from the beginning. Man, did I make a good choice. (Applause.) Thank you, Josh. Tremendous future. A man who is brilliant and who actually was deceived, to an extent, comes from a great state, Utah, where my poll numbers have gone through the roof. And one of the senators' poll numbers, and not this one, went down big. You saw that. You saw that, Mike? But Mike Lee is a brilliant guy. He's difficult. (Laughter.) Whenever I sign bills , you know, we do sign a lot of legislation that's , it's big and it's powerful, but it's sort of everybody has to approve it. And I see 99 to 1 , (laughter) , 99 to 1. I say, 'Don't tell me who's the one.' (Laughter.) 'Is it Mike?' 'Yes.' (Laughter.) And he always has a good reason for it too, by the way. But he is , he's incredible. And right at the beginning, he knew we were right, Mike, and I appreciate it very much. You're just fantastic. And say hello to the people of Utah and tell them, 'I'm sorry about Mitt Romney. I'm sorry.' (Laughter and applause.) Okay? We can say that Mike Lee is, by far, the most popular senator from the state. But you've done a fantastic job, Mike, in many ways. In many ways. A young woman who I didn't know at all, but she's been so supportive , and I've had great support from other people in that state. And she's been so supportive, and she's been downright nasty and mean about the unfairness to the President. And Kelly Loeffler, I appreciate very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Great. She saw it very early on, and we have , I don't know if we have other senators here, but we got a hell of a lot of congressmen. And I'll go over them quickly, but they have , they have also been , you know, it helped when we won 197 to nothing. That's got to be a first, Kevin. Right? Is that, like, a first? The Republicans have this image. See, I say Democrats are lousy politicians because they have lousy policy: open borders, sanctuary cities. They have horrible policy. Who the hell can win? Oh, their new policy is: Raise taxes. They want to raise taxes. You know, all my life, I wasn't in politics, but I'd say, if you're a politician, you want to say, 'We're going to lower taxes.' They want to raise taxes. So they have open borders, sanctuary cities. 'Raise everybody's taxes. Get rid of everybody's healthcare.' A hundred and eighty million people in the United States. And they're really happy. 'And we're going to give you a healthcare that's going to cost more money than the country could make in 30 years if it really does well.' That's one year. So I've always said they're lousy politicians, but they do two things: They are vicious and mean. Vicious. These people are vicious. Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. And she wanted to impeach a long time ago. When she said, 'I pray for the President. I pray for the ' , she doesn't pray. She may pray, but she prays for the opposite. (Laughter.) But I doubt she prays at all. And these are vicious people, but they do two things: They stick together, historically. I'm not talking now. They stick together like glue. That's how they impeached, because they had whatever the number is , 220 people. So if they don't lose anybody, they'll be able to impeach anybody. You could be George Washington. You could have just won the war, and they say, 'Let's get him out of office.' And they stuck together, and they're vicious as hell. And they'll probably come back for more, but maybe not because the Republican Party's poll numbers, Mitch, have now gone up more than any time, I think, since 2004, 2005, and you know what happened then. But in normal times , decades, you would call it; that was a little unusual time; it was for a very short period , the Republicans Party , Party's poll numbers and Donald Trump's poll numbers are the highest I've ever had them. So maybe they were. It's no way to get your poll numbers up. It's not worth it , because from my family's standpoint, it's been very unfair for my family. It's been very unfair to the country. Think of it. A phone call. A very good phone call. I know bad phone calls. This is a phone call with many people. I think Mike Pompeo was probably on the call. Where is Mike? Mike Pompeo was on the call. Many people were on the call. I know there were many people. They even have 'apprenti,' bringing up an old favorite word of mine. 'The Apprentice.' They have 'apprenti.' They have people on these calls. And I know there are many. When I speak to the head of a nation , and they have many people on. I mean, also on , do you think they just , in the case of Ukraine, he's a new president, seems like a very nice person, by the way. His whole thing was corruption. He's going to stop corruption. We even have a treaty , 2001, 1999. It's a treaty , signed treaty , that we will work together to root out corruption in Ukraine. I probably have a legal obligation, Mr. Attorney, to report corruption. But they don't think it's corrupt when a son that made no money, that got thrown out of the military, that had no money at all, is working for $3 million up front, $83,000 a month. And that's only Ukraine. Then goes to China, picks up $1.5 billion. Then goes to Romania, I hear, and many other countries. They think that's okay? Because if it is , is Ivanka in the audience? Is Ivanka here? Boy, my kids could make a fortune. (Laughter.) They could make a fortune. It's corrupt. But it's not even that; it's just general corruption. And the other thing, as mentioned in the call and something that I've told Mike Pence, our great Vice President , I would tell him all the time, and I told him when he went on the trip, because he was over there. He never mentioned anything about this when you had your meeting. It's a terrible thing. But I told Mike. I said, 'Mike, we're giving them money, and, you know, you're always torn about that because we have our country to build, we have our cities to build and our roads to fix. But we're giving them money. Tell me, why isn't Germany paying money? Why isn't France? Why isn't United Kingdom paying money? Why aren't they paying money? Why are we paying them money?' Is that a correct statement, Mike? I say, 'Find out what the hell is going on.' And I told that to all of my people, OMB. I said , I asked that question: 'How much is Germany paying? Why isn't Germany paying?' Why is the United States always the sucker? Because we're a bunch of suckers. But that's turning around fast. But it makes it harder when stuff like this happens, because you want to focus, and you want to focus perfectly. Think what we could have done if the same energy was put into infrastructure, prescription drug prices. Think of what we could have done. And I'm now talking both sides. Think of what we could have done if we had the same genius , because it's genius. I will say, it's genius on the other side , maybe even more so because they took nothing and brought me to a final vote of impeachment. That's a very ugly word to me. It's a very dark word. Very ugly. They took nothing. They took a phone call that was a totally appropriate call. I call it a 'perfect call' because it was. And they brought me to the final stages of impeachment. But now we have that gorgeous word , I never thought a word would sound so good. It's called 'total acquittal.' (Applause.) Total acquittal. So , so I want to, if I could, real fast, just introduce a few of the people. I have to start with , I have to start with Kevin. Man, did you do a job. Lucky you're there. Lucky you're there because it wouldn't have worked out. If you don't have the right people , I'll tell you, Kevin McCarthy has done an incredible job. (Applause.) Really. Stand up. And he loves this job, and he loves this country. I'll tell you what: Mitch and Kevin, they love what they do. Now, Mitch wouldn't even tell you he liked it. (Laughter.) I'd say, 'Mitch, do you like it?' 'I don't know.' (Laughter.) He's the greatest poker player, right? Kevin will say, 'I love it.' Right? And I will say that you're going to be Speaker of the House because of this impeachment hoax. (Applause.) I really believe it. I really believe it. And I'm going to work hard on it. I'm going to try and get out to those Trump , those Trump areas that we won by a lot. And, you know, in '18, we didn't win. We just won two seats in North Carolina , two wonderful seats in North Carolina that were not supposed to be won. But I went and I made speeches, and we had rallies, and we did a great job and we won. We took two seats. Nobody writes about that. If we lost them, it would have been the biggest story of the year. But we're going to go, we're going to do a job, and we're going to win a lot of seats. We're going to win a lot of seats. People are very angry that Nancy Pelosi and all of these guys , I mean, Nadler , I know him much of my life; he's fought me in New York for 25 years. I always beat him. And I had to beat him another time. And I'll probably have to beat him again. Because if they find that I happen to walk across the street, and maybe go against the light or something, 'Let's impeach him.' (Laughter.) So we'll probably have to do it again because these people have gone stone-cold crazy. But I've beaten them all my life, and I'll beat them again if I have to. (Applause.) But what they're doing is very unfair. Very unfair. So Kevin McCarthy has been great. So, a few names, right? And there'll be a few you forget. If you want, you can raise and I'll say, 'Great. Love to have you. Wonderful.' (Laughter.) But we're going to do the best we can. And I have my Cabinet, but my Cabinet is different , I appoint them. Okay? I didn't see all of them helping so much. (Laughter.) You know, they were running their various bureaucracies, right? (Laughter.) No, my Cabinet is great, and they're all here. But today is the day to celebrate these great warriors, right? These are great warriors. They really fought hard for us. And , So I'll start: Kelly Armstrong, North Dakota. Kelly, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) Great job. Jim Banks of Indiana. Jim, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) Andy Biggs. Where is Andy? Boy, oh, boy, Andy. He got , (applause) , there's a guy. He's tough. I hear we're doing well in Arizona, huh? It's going good, yeah? I think so. I think I saw a poll that was very good for me. I think we have to make sure Martha is going to do , I think Martha is going to do good. But we have some states that are going to be not easy, but Arizona has been great. And we're stopping illegal aliens from coming in. We're putting up walls. New Mexico, too, a state that's never been in play for Republicans, is totally in play. Right? Nevada is really looking good. We're doing well. We're doing well. We're going to have a great , there's more spirit. I will say this: There's more spirit now for the Republican Party, by far, than the Democrats. You know, Mike Pence just got back from a place , a beautiful place that Chuck Grassley knows well: Iowa. And he was talking about these fiasco , the Democrats, they can't count some simple votes, and yet they want to take over your healthcare system. Think of that. (Laughter.) No, think of it. But we also had an election out there, and we got 98 percent of the vote. We have two people running, you know, and I guess they consider them non-people, but they are running. I mean, one was a governor. One was a congressman. They're running. We got 98 percent of the vote. And everybody from the media was saying, 'Who are those crowds over there?' You know, they expect it to be one of these competitive , where everybody is running because they want to win, they want to win. And it was Trump. Right, Mark Meadows? It was Trump. This was a Trump crowd. And a lot of , actually, a lot of my guys went there. They went to Iowa. And a lot of friends went there, and we had tremendous , they say the spirit , the spirit for the Republican Party right now is stronger, I think, than it's ever been in the history of our country. I think it's stronger than it's ever been. (Applause.) And that includes Honest Abe Lincoln. You know, a lot of people forget Abe Lincoln. I wish he were here. I'd give him one hell of an introduction. Right? (Laughter.) But he was , he was a Republican. Abe Lincoln. Honest Abe. Bradley Byrne, Alabama. What a great place. (Applause.) Thank you, Bradley. A man who has been an unbelievable friend of mine and spokesman, and somebody that , that I really like. And I know, Kelly, you're going to end up liking him a lot. Something is going to happen that's going to be very good. I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet. But Doug Collins , where is he? Where is Doug? (Applause.) You have been so great. Thank you very much, Doug. Thank you very much. Thank you. Really amazing job. A young man who is , born with a great gene, because I know his father and how great a politician he was. But he's from Florida. Sometimes controversial, but actually, he's not controversial. He's solid as a rock and he's a friend of mine. Matt Gaetz. Matt? (Applause.) Thank you, Matt. Thank you. Great job. All right, this guy. So he's the NCAA , meaning, a couple of years ago, when he was in college , wrestling champion. NCAA. That's the big deal. That means, in all of college, you're the champ, you're the best. His record was ridiculous. Nobody would , nobody could beat him. And I see it. You know, every time, I see it. When I first got to know him , Jim Jordan , when I first got to know Jim, I said, 'Huh, he never wears a jacket. What the hell is going on?' (Laughter.) He's obviously very proud of his body. (Laughter and applause.) And they say where he works out , you know, where the congressmen, senators, they work out , they say, when Jim works out , even though he's not as young as he was, but he works out , the machine starts burning. You know, it's just a different form of a workout than us. Right, Sonny? And , there he is. Look at that guy. But one day I'm looking, and he looks tough. And I'm looking, and I'm looking at those ears. And I say, 'Those ears have something going on there.' I said, 'Did you ever wrestle?' 'Yeah, I did.' But he doesn't talk. But I checked. This guy was a world , this guy was a champion, top, top wrestler. And when I had the top , I had all of the teams. And, by the way, your Super Bowl champions are coming, I think next week or soon. Very soon. And every one of them want to be here. (Applause.) And the coach loves us. The coach is great. Andy Reid. And every one of them want to be here. We have , people love it. But we had all of the NCAA championship teams here. They had the golf, the basketball. They had every team here. And one of the teams was wrestling. The wrestling team. Was that Penn State? And Penn State won the title. They have a great team. And I walked up with Jim, and it's like I didn't exist. (Laughter.) Those wrestlers, they grabbed him. They love Jim Jordan, and we love you too because you are some warrior. (Applause.) True. True. A woman who became a star , we have a couple of women that became stars. You two. And I always liked the name of her , you know, I liked the name, 'Lesko.' I liked it. That's how I picked it. I liked the name. I saw that face. I saw that everything. They gave me cards. She had like seven opponents, right? And you have no idea how much the public appreciates how smart, how sharp you are. This I can't tell. I can't tell. They just said, 'You know, she's really good. She's really talented.' And I said, 'Let's go.' We worked with her. She won her race. Tough race. It's no longer tough. Because what she does out there is incredible. Arizona loves her. But you were so incredible, representing , I don't say 'me' , representing our country and getting it out of this impeachment hoax. What you did was incredible. So, Debbie, please stand up. Debbie Lesko. (Applause.) A man who I , I became very friendly with , I don't know why. Do you ever have where , I'll ask the media: If certain people call, you take their calls. Other people call , if they don't have information, they won't take anybody's call. But other people call, and you don't. This is a guy , he just , he's just a very special guy. His wife I actually like better than him, to be honest. (Laughter.) Because he doesn't know that I know that he didn't actually support me right from the beginning, but she did. (Laughter.) And on my worst day , right? , on my worst day, my worst , I won't tell you why it was my worst, but it was not one of those good days , she got on a bus, got many other buses and women all over North Carolina, and they toured North Carolina. Well, Mark was back sort of semi-supporting another candidate, which he ended up leaving very quickly. I don't think you had a choice, because of your wife, but thank her. And Mark Meadows, he's an extraordinary guy. I mean, the only problem is, I guess, he's announcing , he'd only win by 40 points, but he's announcing that he'll be not running this time. Do you have somebody good to run? Somebody going to win your district by at least 20 points, please? Okay? But he's a tremendously talented man, not just as a politician. As a human being, he's incredible. And during these horrible times , I mean, the way he worked and Jim and all of you guys , the way they worked so , it was like their life was at stake. So many. Ron DeSantis is another one. He worked so hard. Then he called me. He said, 'Sir, I'd like to run for governor.' I said, 'Governor? I don't want you to run. I like you staying.' 'No, I want to run for governor.' And I said, 'Well, if you have to.' 'I'd like your support.' I said, 'How can I support you? You're at three.' He was at three. He had no money. Somebody was at 38 and they had $22 million cash, right? I said, 'Look, if it's important, I'll do it,' because they , he's been another great warrior. And he's , by the way, he ran. I endorsed him. His numbers went through the roof. The man who we beat, who was expected to win easily, called me after the race. He said, 'You endorsed him, and it was like a nuclear bomb went off. There was nothing I could do.' He never even spent his money. He saved it. But Ron DeSantis is another one, and now he's the governor of Florida. And, by the way, he's a great governor. He's a very popular governor. His numbers are in the 70s. And he's done a great job. But, Mark, I want to thank you very much. Fantastic job. Thank you very much. Mark Meadows. (Applause.) And Mike Johnson of Louisiana. Where's Mike? Central casting. What a job. You can represent me anytime. (Applause.) You can represent me anytime. Thank you. What a job you've done. Thank you, Mike. And a man nobody has ever heard of, except the other side. He's the other side's worst nightmare. This guy goes down into dungeons and basements; he'll find a document, no matter what. He's the most legitimate human being. He's the hardest worker. He's unbelievable. He took tremendous abuse. I mean, abuse. The , the media and, you know, the other side, and the bad ones, the leakers, the liars, the dirty cops , they wanted to destroy him. They tried. They got close, but he wouldn't let it happen. And, honestly, in a certain way, he was the first one. Wouldn't you say, Jim and Mark and everybody? This was the first guy. He came out of nowhere. He's saying, 'These people are corrupt.' He's still saying it. And he was unbelievable. Devin Nunes. He was unbelievable. Unbelievable. (Applause.) That's so true, Devin. He'd come in and say , I didn't even know hi;, I just heard there were like , there was this congressman who kept going into a basement , into files. (Laughter.) He knew something was wrong. You felt it, right? And now we know a lot more than we knew then, right? You never thought it was as bad as it is. And hopefully we're going to take care of things, because we can never, ever allow this to happen again. (Applause.) Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. Scott, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Scott. Really great. And you're doing very well over there, by the way. Just saw your numbers.A man who is a , I mean, central casting. If I'm going to pick Perry Mason, I'm going to do a remake of Perry Mason , other than Bill Barr, I'd pick this guy. But I have to say, I'll pick Barr. I pick Barr first, right? (Laughter.) John Ratcliffe, right? But I have to tell you, if we're doing a remake of Perry Mason, the man I get , there's nobody in Hollywood like this , John Ratcliffe, right? (Applause.) Stand up, John. So , such a great lawyer. Incredible guy. Incredible talent. But just a great lawyer and we appreciate it. He gets on that screen, and everyone says, 'I agree.' The other side folds up so fast. We'll probably be using a lot of you in the next year. But you have been fantastic, John. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. A man who's braver than me and braver than all of us in this room. He got , he got whacked. He got whacked. My Steve, right? I went to the hospital with our great First Lady that night. Right, honey? And we saw a man that was not going to make it. He was not going to make it. He was , the doctor , and I told him his wife , I said, 'She loves you.' 'Why do you say that?' Because she was devastated. A lot of wives wouldn't give a damn. (Laughter.) A lot of , a lot of wives , a lot of wives would have said, 'Oh, yeah.' I said, 'How's he doing?' 'Oh ' She couldn't even talk. She was inconsolable. Most wives would say, 'Not good. Listen, I'm going home now.' (Laughter.) But the doctor came in , the wife is like , she was a total mess. She was really devastated. And he really , it looked like he had a 20, 25 percent chance. I think you set a record for blood loss. And, Steve Scalise, I , actually, honestly, I think you're better looking now. You're more handsome now. (Laughter.) You , you weren't that good looking. You look good now. (Laughter.) He looks better now. Can you believe it? I don't know what the hell that is. (Applause.) It's true. Better now. (Applause.) What a guy. And he was practicing , he was practicing for the baseball game against, I guess, the Democrats, right? And this whack-job started shooting. Hurt Roger , I don't know if Roger is here. But hurt a number of people , hit them. But really hit Steve. He , Steve was at second base. He was the second baseman. And he went down and it was terrible. I mean, I saw the whole thing and it was terrible. Fortunately, you had two brave policemen with you. Because of your high position in Congress, you had two policemen and they were amazing , the man and a woman. And they came and they didn't have rifles. They were against a, supposedly, pretty good sharpshooter with rifles , good equipment. And all they had was a gun. And they started coming in from the outfield, shooting. And they're so far away that a handgun is not preferred. This guy has the rifle and he's hitting people. And he was going to move up and there was no out. I mean, if he would have been able to move up, there was no way to get out. The entrance was a single entranceway on the other side, where he was. So everyone went into the dugout , ran into the dugout, but Steve was really hit badly in the stomach, and , with a bullet that rips you apart. It was supposed to do that. It rips , it rips you apart. And these two people came charging forward. Boom. Boom. Boom. And one of them , you know who , one of them , him? , got the shooter. Hit him. And then got him. Killed him from the long distance. It was amazing. If you didn't have those two people , you can imagine, right? You could imagine what would happen. So Melania and I went to the hospital that night. And he was in such bad shape, and he's been working ever since, so hard. But six months ago, they had a baseball game at the Nationals Park. And I'm watching and it's , it's on television. And it's just, you know, a game. People , you want to win it, right? And Steve's at second base. The poor guy can't even walk. Do you remember Bobby Richardson for the New York Yankees? He was known for range, Louie. Range. He had the greatest range. If a ball is hit to shortstop , Bobby Richardson is the second player, the second baseman , Bobby Richardson would field the ball. If it's hit to first base, he'll throw it to the first baseman. He had unbelievable range. This was not Steve Scalise. (Laughter.) Steve had no range. (Laughter.) One foot and he has to fall down, right? Because, you know, he was trying to get better. I don't know who the hell put you on the field. (Laughter.) And this is a true story. So the game starts and the first pitch , Steve is standing at second base and the guy is really in bad shape. And I said, 'This is terrible.' A shot , groundball shot is hit to second and Steve. I say , I didn't have time to think too much, but I said, 'This is not good. That ball is going toward him.' And this guy stopped that ball, caught the call. He's now laying down. He throws the ball to first base. He gets him out. I said, 'It's the most incredible thing.' I've never seen , athletically , (applause) , I've never seen anything like it, right? And he gets him out and they then took him out of the game, which was a very wise thing because you could never do that again in a million years. (Laughter.) But you weren't going to let that ball go through. I don't care if it was hit by the greatest of all time, right? That ball was not going through you, because you are a warrior. Steve is , he is fantastic. You are fantastic. You and Liz and Kevin. What a great , what a group. I mean, what a group. I got lucky. I got lucky because you need the right people. If I had the wrong people there, he , maybe a different story. Maybe we'd be celebrating something else. But I really want to thank you, Steve Scalise. And, Elise, you , I just read this story; she's the most incredible , what's going on with you, Elise. So I even said , you know, I was up campaigning for her, helping her. But I thought, 'She looks good. She looks like good talent.' But did I not realize, when she opens that mouth, you were killing them, Elise. (Laughter.) You were killing them. (Applause.) Elise , and there's a big story in the New York Post , I love the New York Post because they treat me well. There aren't too many of you that do. But today, you're treating me well. I even had a great headline , New York Times, Washington Post. I had all of these great headlines. Maybe we should just end it right there. (Laughter.) But you had the greatest story, yesterday in the Post, that people from all over the country are contributing to her campaign. They were so enthralled with the way you handled yourself, what you said, the way you said it. And I'll always be your friend. I think it was , it's really an amazing story. What a great future you have. What a great future. Thank you. (Applause.) The First Lady agrees, by the way. The First Lady agrees. And Michael Turner, you can represent me anytime. Where's Michael? Where is he? (Applause.) Or you can represent me. How good were you? There's another , there's another Perry Mason type, I think. Right? What do you think, John? But, Michael, you were fantastic and we appreciate it. Brad Wenstrup. Where's Brad? Brad. (Applause.) Great, great job. This is a big day for lawyers. You notice only the lawyers stayed? All the lawyers stayed behind. Lee Zeldin. How good are you? How good are you? (Applause.) Man. And, Louie, your name is not down. They didn't give me your name. Do you know , if I didn't announce Louie , (laughter) , whoever the hell made this list, I got to get rid of because I , if I wouldn't have announced Louie, it might have been the end of the presidency. (Laughter.) Louie, you have been so great. So tough and so smart. I got it just , (laughs) , I got it. But Louie has been amazing. He's a tough guy. He's a smart guy. He's streetwise like crazy. We love Texas, and we're with you all the way, Louie. We're with you all the way. Thank you very much. (Applause.) So that's the story. We have a great group of warriors, and there are others left, and, I guess, probably, I'm sure I didn't mention a few, and I apologize if that's the case. How's CPAC doing? Good? Huh? My man, stand up please, will you? He's the one who said, 'You should run.' (Applause.) Right? Matt said , it's like five years ago, six years ago. And I made a speech, and then they do some kind of a straw poll: 'Who made the best speech?' And he said, 'I made the best speech.' With all this professional , I hate to say this: With all these professional politicians, they voted, by far, the best speech was Trump. He calls me, he says, 'You should run for politics.' I say, 'What do I know about politics?' But you know what? We learned quickly, and our country has never done better than it's doing right now. (Applause.) So it's been good. (Applause.) But thank you, Matt. Great. Say hello. So that's the story. We've been treated very unfairly. Fortunately, we have great men and women that came to our defense. If we didn't, this would have been a horrific incident for our country. When you have Lisa and Peter, the lovers, the FBI lovers: 'I want to believe the path you threw out for' Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. That's the office. 'There's no way he gets elected' , meaning me. 'There's no way he gets elected.' This is Peter, to Lisa. He's probably trying to impress her, for obvious reasons. (Laughter.) 'There's no way he gets elected. But I'm afraid we can't take the risk.' Now, think of this. In other words, if I get elected, they can't , 'they'; two low-lifes , they can't take the risk. They can't take the risk. Think of it. And that's where it came up, the greatest word of all: 'insurance policy.' So he says, 'But I'm afraid we can't take the risk. She may lose.' It's like an insurance policy. In the unlikely event you die before you're 40 , in other words, if I won, they were going to do exactly what they did to us. They were going to try and overthrow the government of the United States , a duly elected president. And if I didn't fire James Comey, we would have never found this stuff. Because when I fired that sleazebag, all hell broke out. They were ratting on each other. They were running for the hills. Let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. It's in the hands of some very talented people. We're going to have to see what happens. But I can tell you, in my opinion, these are the crookedest, most dishonest, dirtiest people I've ever seen. They said , this is Strzok: 'God, Hillary should win 100 million to one.' This is about me. This is an agent from the FBI. Look how they let her off. Thirty-three thousand emails deleted. Nothing happens to her. Nothing happens. It's unbelievable. But think of that , 'God, Hillary should win' , when these guys are investigating Hillary. Then they go to work for Mueller , the two of them , and when Muller found out that everybody knew that they were 100 percent this way, he let them go. But they deleted all of their emails and text messages. So when we got the phone, they were all deleted. Could you imagine the treasure trove? They illegally deleted. So they left. They left Bob Mueller. He had the look, but he didn't have a lot of other things. Always had the look. Mr. G-Man. And I love the FBI and the FBI loves me , 99 percent. It was the top scum. And the FBI people don't like the top scum. So think of that: 100 million to one. And he's investigating me. And then, 'God, Trump is a loathsome human being, isn't he?' These are the people looking at me. I'm really not a bad person. And Page said, 'Yes, he's awful.' How would you like to have that? This is just , this is the good stuff. There's stuff a hundred times worse than that. These are all dirty people. And now, I just heard that they're suing the United States of America because they were interfered with. We're not going to let it happen. Just not going to let it happen. We cannot let this happen to our country. We can't. (Applause.) So, I'm going to leave now. And I don't know if any of you have anything to say. You could say it. But this is sort of a day of celebration, because we went through hell. And I'm sure that Pelosi and Cryin' Chuck , I've known this guy all the , the only time I ever saw him cry was when it was appropriate. Known him for a long time. Cryin' Chuck. But I'm sure they'll try and cook up other things. They'll go through the state of New York. They'll go through other places. They'll do whatever they can. Because instead of wanting to heal our country and fix our country, all they want to do , in my opinion, it's almost like they want to destroy our country. We can't let it happen. Jim Jordan, did you want to say something? Go ahead. Huh? Mark? Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) This was a highly partisan situation. Pelosi said , I copied it down exactly. Before the impeachment , she wanted to impeach from day one, by the way. Don't let it fool you. You know, she said, 'No, the impeachment is a very serious thing.' I said, 'She wants to impeach. Watch.' Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan , bipartisan. It was 197 to nothing. And other than one failed presidential candidate , and I call that 'half a vote' because he actually voted for us on the other one. But we had one failed presidential candidate. That's the only half a vote we lost. So, we had almost 53 to nothing. We had 197 to nothing. And the only one that voted against was a guy that can't stand the fact that he ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of the presidency. But she said, 'There's something so compelling , it has to be so compelling and so overwhelming and bipartisan. I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country' , she was right about that , 'and it's just not worth it.' That was Nancy Pelosi a year ago. Right? And I think it's a shame. I think it's a shame. But as I said, if we can put this genius to work on roads and highways and bridges and all of the things we can do , prescription drugs. You know, we had , Secretary Azar is here and I want to thank him for this, but we had , first time in 51 years, where drug prices actually came down last year. First time in 51 years. But what we can do, working with both parties in Congress, is , would be unbelievable. It would be unbelievable , all we can do. And I know Chuck Grassley is working very hard on it and Mitch is working very hard on it. But what we can do is , is incredible. What we can do, just generally. We've done so much without it. We've rebuilt our military. We've cut regulations at a level that nobody thought possible. We'll always protect our Second Amendment; we all know that. But I just want to tell you that it's an honor to be with you all. I want to apologize to my family for having them have to go through a phony, rotten deal by some very evil and sick people. And Ivanka is here, and my , my sons and my whole family, and that includes Barron. (Applause.) That includes Barron, who is up there as a young boy. Stand up, honey. (Applause.) Ivanka, thank you, honey. Come. Come. (Applause.) (The President hugs Ivanka Trump.) Come here, baby. (Applause.) (The President hugs the First Lady.) So I just want to thank my family for sticking through it. This was not part of the deal. I was going to run for President, and if I won, I was going do a great job. I didn't know that I was going to run, and then when I got in, I was going to have to run again and again and again. Every week, I had to run again. That wasn't the deal, but they stuck with me. And I'm so glad I did it because we are making progress and doing things for our great people that everybody said couldn't be done. Our country is thriving. Our country is just respected again. And it's an honor to be with the people in this room. Thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)"}

EST THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Well, thank you very much. I'm working very hard for you, I will tell you. (Laughter.) And sometimes you don't make it easy, and I certainly don't make it easy on you. (Laughter.) And I will continue that tradition, if I might, this morning. And, Arthur, I don't know if I agree with you. (Laughter.) But I don't know if Arthur is going to like what I'm going to say. (Laughter.) But I love listening to you. It's really great. Thank you very much. And thank you, congressmen, for the great job you've been doing and the relationship and the help. You're a warrior. Thank you very much. And, Kevin, you're a warrior. Thank you. The job you've done is incredible. It wasn't supposed to be that way. A lot of extra work. Unnecessary work. It's wonderful to be with the thousands of religious believers for the 68th annual National Prayer Breakfast. I've been here from the first one, where I had the privilege of being asked. I've been with you for a long time before then. And we've made tremendous progress. Tremendous progress. You know what we've done. I don't think anybody has done more than all of us together during these last three years. And it's been my honor. But this morning, we come together as one nation, blessed to live in freedom and grateful to worship in peace. As everybody knows, my family, our great country, and your President, have been put through a terrible ordeal by some very dishonest and corrupt people. They have done everything possible to destroy us, and by so doing, very badly hurt our nation. They know what they are doing is wrong, but they put themselves far ahead of our great country. Weeks ago, and again yesterday, courageous Republican politicians and leaders had the wisdom, the fortitude, and strength to do what everyone knows was right. I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong. Nor do I like people who say, \"I pray for you,\" when they know that that's not so. So many people have been hurt, and we can't let that go on. And I'll be discussing that a little bit later at the White House. We're joined today by two people whose faith inspires us all: our amazing, wonderful friend, Vice President Mike Pence , (applause) , and his wonderful wife, Karen. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to all of our great political leaders out there , so many that I've been working with so hard over the last three years. And we've accomplished so much. And to members of my Cabinet in attendance , Secretary Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper, David Bernhardt , (applause) , Gene Scalia, Alex Azar, Ben Carson, Dan Brouillette, Betsy DeVos, Robert Wilke, and Administrator Jovita Carranza. Joining us , (applause) , for this cherished tradition are a lot of friends in the audience. And many, really, have become friends. They are political leaders. They've become great friends. That's all I get to meet anymore. (Laughter.) That and the enemies and the allies. And we have them all. We have allies. We have enemies. Sometimes the allies are enemies, but we just don't know it. (Laughter.) But we're changing all that. But thank you all, and thank you all for being here. I also want to welcome foreign dignitaries from more than 140 countries. That's something. (Applause.) That's something. Everyone here today is united by a shared conviction. We know that our nation is stronger, our future is brighter, and our joy is greater when we turn to God and ask him to shed his grace on our lives. On Tuesday, I addressed Congress on the state of the Union and the great American comeback. That's what it is. (Applause.) Our country has never done better than it is doing right now. Our economy is the strongest it has ever been. And for those of you that are interested in stocks, it looks like the stock market will be way up again today. According to the latest Gallup poll that just came out a little while ago, a few minutes ago, American satisfaction is at the highest level ever recorded. Can you imagine? And that's from Gallup , no friend of mine. (Applause.) Ninety percent of Americans say they are satisfied with their personal lives. How about that? Isn't that something? Just came out today. (Applause.) They must have known I was going to be here. (Laughter.) In everything we do, we are creating a culture that protects freedom, and that includes religious freedom. (Applause.) As I said on Tuesday in the House Chamber, \"In America, we don't punish prayer. We don't tear down crosses. We don't ban symbols of faith. We don't muzzle preachers.\" We don't muzzle pastors. \"In America, we celebrate faith, we cherish religion, we lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God.\" (Applause.) So much of the greatness we have achieved, the mysteries we've unlocked, and the wonders we've built, the challenges we've met, and the incredible heights that we've reached has come from the faith of our families and the prayers of our people. Before America declared independence, patriots in all 13 colonies came together in days of fasting and prayer. In the bitter cold of Valley Forge, Washington and his men had no food, no supplies, and very little chance of victory. It reminded me a little bit of 2016. We had very little chance of victory. (Laughter.) Except for the people in this room and some others believed we were going to win. I believed we were going to win. But what they did have was have an unwavering belief that God was with them. I believe that too. God is with the people in this room. Before a single skyscraper rose up in New York City, thousands of poor American families donated all they could to build the magnificent St. Patrick's Cathedral. (Applause.)When Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon, he said, \"Houston, I would like to request a few moments of silence.\" Then, he read from the Bible. (Applause.) At every stage, our nation's long march for civil rights was inspired, sustained, and uplifted by faith, prayer, and devotion of religious believers. To protect faith communities, I have taken historic action to defend religious liberty, including the constitutional right to pray in public schools. (Applause.) We can also talk about the Johnson Amendment. We can talk about Mexico City Policy. We've done a lot. But I also recently took executive action to stop taxpayer dollars from going to colleges and universities that spread the poison of anti-Semitism and bad things about Christianity. (Applause.) We are upholding the sanctity of life , sanctity of life. (Applause.) And we are doing that like nobody has ever done it before from this position. You better get out and vote on November 3rd , (laughter) , because you have a lot of people out there that aren't liking what we're doing. And we're pursuing medical breakthroughs to save premature babies because every child is a sacred gift from God. (Applause.) Together, we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society. We are lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We are bringing hope to forgotten communities. And more Americans are working today , 160 million. A little bit short. Just a little bit. One hundred and sixty million. We've never been even close , than ever before. Think of it: More Americans are working today , almost 160 million , than ever before. Our unemployment numbers are the best in the history of our country. (Applause.) A more specific number and numbers that you hear me say, if you listen: African American, Asian American, Hispanic American , the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country. Women , best in 71 years. Sorry. We'll have you there soon. Soon, it will be \"historic.\" I have to apologize to the women; it's only 71 years. But the best unemployment numbers, we have , we're doing things that nobody thought possible. We're setting records that nobody thought achievable. And to give former prisoners a second chance at life, which so many people in this room have worked on for so long , (applause) , we passed criminal justice reform into law, and I signed it nine months ago. And it's proving more and more that America is indeed a nation that believes in redemption. What's happened with prisoners is a miracle. Prisoners would come out and nobody would give them a job. And oftentimes, most of the time , almost all of the time , they'd go back into prison. They'd get caught doing something bad. They had no money. They had no hope. They had no job. Now they're coming out into a booming economy. And employers are hiring them, and to a certain extent, maybe because they're having a hard time getting people. First time in our country's history, actually, we're running out of people. We have plants moving in by the thousands. We have car companies coming from Japan and from Germany, from lots of other places, and we need people. And employers are hiring prisoners, and they would have never done it, except for what we've done with criminal justice reform. But even before that, because the economy has become so powerful. And these prisoners have done an incredible job. The employers are saying, \"Why didn't I do this 20 years ago?\" So it's an incredible thing what's happening to people that are given a second chance, and sometimes a third chance, in all fairness. And it's something that everybody in this room should be very proud about, because you've always felt that way long before it was fashionable. So I want to thank you for that. (Applause.) As we revive our economy, we are also renewing our national spirit. Today we proudly proclaim that faith is alive and well and thriving in America. And we're going to keep it that way. Nobody will have it changed. (Applause.) It won't happen. As long as I'm here, it will never, ever happen. (Applause.) Something which wasn't done nearly enough , I could almost say wasn't done at all , we are standing up for persecuted Christians and religious minorities all around the world , (applause) , like nobody has ever done. Last year, at the United Nations, I was honored to be the first President to host a meeting of religious freedom. It was based all on religious freedom. That was the first meeting of its kind ever held at the United Nations. There I called upon all nations to combat the terrible injustice of religious persecution. And people listened. And countries that we give billions of dollars to, they listened because they had to listen. (Laughter.) It's amazing how that works, isn't it? (Laughter.) That nobody ever played that game before. (Laughter.) Weeks ago, a 21-year-old woman, who goes by the name of Mary, was seized and imprisoned in Iran because she converted to Christianity and shared the Gospel with others. In Venezuela, the dictator Maduro has arrested church leaders. At the State of the Union, I was honored to host the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaid\u00f3. (Applause.) Good man. I told him that all Americans stand with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom. Yesterday, our administration launched the International Religious Freedom Alliance, the first-ever alliance devoted to promoting religious liberty. It was something. Really something. (Applause.) More than 25 countries have already joined our campaign. I want to thank Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, along with Ambassador Sam Brownback, who are both here this morning, for leading this historic initiative. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike. (Applause.) Thank you. All of us here today reaffirm these timeless truths: Faith keeps us free. Prayer makes us strong. And God alone is the author of life and the giver of grace. (Applause.) With us this morning is a pastor who embodies the miracle of faith and the power of prayer: Reverend Gerald Toussaint from Louisiana. Reverend Toussaint is an Army veteran, a truck driver, and a pastor. He leads the same church that his father led, Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, which has been a pillar of the community for more than 140 years. Last year, Mount Pleasant was one of three African American churches in Louisiana that was destroyed in a fire set by a wicked, hate-filled arsonist. Yet, in the wake of such shocking evil, America witnessed the unshakable unity, devotion, and spirit of Reverend Toussaint and his entire highly spirited, beautiful congregation. Families quickly came together in prayer. Soon, people from all across Louisiana came to help any way they could. Americans in all 50 states and 20 different countries heard about it and they donated more than $2 million to help rebuild Mount Pleasant , (applause) , and the other two churches that were (inaudible). On Easter Sunday, just days after he lost his church, Reverend Toussaint preached about what it all meant. What does it mean? \"The Easter season,\" he said, \"is a fitting metaphor for recent events. It was dark the day that Jesus was crucified. It was dark [at] night when they burned our church. What has happened since is like a resurrection.\" Old things are gone, but it's going to be a brand-new start, and it's going to be better than ever, Reverend. (Applause.) Better than ever. Fantastic. And today, just 10 months later, the ground is cleared. Careful plans have been made, and they're beautiful plans. And construction is about to begin on the new and very, very magnificent Mount Pleasant Church. Congratulations. (Applause.) You know, the Reverend says that we're rebuilding because that's what Jesus does. He rebuilds, he lives, and he breathes. It's what he does. He wants it to be rebuilt. It was torn apart, but it's being rebuilt again, and I'll bet you it will indeed be bigger, better, and nicer than before. What do you think, Reverend? Yes? And it's going to have your mark on it. It did have and now it will have even great. And your father is looking down on you right now and he's very, very proud of the job that you've done. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Very much inspire us, Reverend. Thank you. Well, I want to just thank everybody. This has been very special. Tell your congregation that , and all of your people , that we have 350 million people in our country. They're proud Americans. And they respect what we're doing, even those that you don't think so much like us, respect us, want to be with us. They're respecting our fight, and we are in a fight. Religion in this country and religion all over the world , certain religions in particular , are under siege. We won't let that happen. We are going to protect our religions. We are going to protect Christianity. We are going to protect our great ministers and pastors and rabbis and all of the people that we so cherish and that we so respect. America is eternally in the debt of our nation's African American churches all throughout this country. That's why it's so fitting and so , it's one of the reasons we chose this particular church in Louisiana. For generations, they bravely fought for justice and lifted up the conscience of our nation. And we're grateful beyond any measure. But I can say that going beyond that, we're grateful to the people in this room for the love they show to religion. Not one religion, but many religions. They are brave. They are brilliant. They are fighters. They like people. And sometimes they hate people. I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm trying to learn. (Laughter.) It's not easy. It's not easy. (Applause.)When they impeach you for nothing, then you're supposed to like them? It's not easy, folks. (Laughter.) I do my best. But I'll tell you what we are doing: We're restoring hope and spreading faith. We're helping citizens of every background take part in the great rebuilding of our nation. We're declaring that America will always shine as a land of liberty and light unto all nations of the world. We want every nation to look up to us like they are right now. We were not a respected nation just a few years ago. We had lost our way. Our country is respected again by everybody. (Applause.) This morning, let us ask Father in Heaven to guide our steps, protect our children, and bless our families. And with all of our heart, let us forever embrace the eternal truth that every child is made equal by the hand of Almighty God. Thank you. God Bless you. And God bless America. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) END 9:37 A.M.

But I also recently took executive action to stop taxpayer dollars from going to colleges and universities that spread the poison of anti-Semitism and bad things about Christianity. (Applause.) We are upholding the sanctity of life , sanctity of life. (Applause.) And we are doing that like nobody has ever done it before from this position. You better get out and vote on November 3rd , (laughter) , because you have a lot of people out there that aren't liking what we're doing. And we're pursuing medical breakthroughs to save premature babies because every child is a sacred gift from God. (Applause.) Together, we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society. We are lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We are bringing hope to forgotten communities. And more Americans are working today , 160 million. A little bit short. Just a little bit. One hundred and sixty million. We've never been even close , than ever before. Think of it: More Americans are working today , almost 160 million , than ever before. Our unemployment numbers are the best in the history of our country. (Applause.) A more specific number and numbers that you hear me say, if you listen: African American, Asian American, Hispanic American , the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country. Women , best in 71 years. Sorry. We'll have you there soon. Soon, it will be 'historic.' I have to apologize to the women; it's only 71 years. But the best unemployment numbers, we have , we're doing things that nobody thought possible. We're setting records that nobody thought achievable. And to give former prisoners a second chance at life, which so many people in this room have worked on for so long , (applause) , we passed criminal justice reform into law, and I signed it nine months ago. And it's proving more and more that America is indeed a nation that believes in redemption. What's happened with prisoners is a miracle. Prisoners would come out and nobody would give them a job. And oftentimes, most of the time , almost all of the time , they'd go back into prison. They'd get caught doing something bad. They had no money. They had no hope. They had no job. Now they're coming out into a booming economy. And employers are hiring them, and to a certain extent, maybe because they're having a hard time getting people. First time in our country's history, actually, we're running out of people. We have plants moving in by the thousands. We have car companies coming from Japan and from Germany, from lots of other places, and we need people. And employers are hiring prisoners, and they would have never done it, except for what we've done with criminal justice reform. But even before that, because the economy has become so powerful. And these prisoners have done an incredible job. The employers are saying, 'Why didn't I do this 20 years ago?' So it's an incredible thing what's happening to people that are given a second chance, and sometimes a third chance, in all fairness. And it's something that everybody in this room should be very proud about, because you've always felt that way long before it was fashionable. So I want to thank you for that. (Applause.) As we revive our economy, we are also renewing our national spirit. Today we proudly proclaim that faith is alive and well and thriving in America. And we're going to keep it that way. Nobody will have it changed. (Applause.) It won't happen. As long as I'm here, it will never, ever happen. (Applause.) Something which wasn't done nearly enough , I could almost say wasn't done at all , we are standing up for persecuted Christians and religious minorities all around the world , (applause) , like nobody has ever done. Last year, at the United Nations, I was honored to be the first President to host a meeting of religious freedom. It was based all on religious freedom. That was the first meeting of its kind ever held at the United Nations. There I called upon all nations to combat the terrible injustice of religious persecution. And people listened. And countries that we give billions of dollars to, they listened because they had to listen. (Laughter.) It's amazing how that works, isn't it? (Laughter.) That nobody ever played that game before. (Laughter.) Weeks ago, a 21-year-old woman, who goes by the name of Mary, was seized and imprisoned in Iran because she converted to Christianity and shared the Gospel with others. In Venezuela, the dictator Maduro has arrested church leaders. At the State of the Union, I was honored to host the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaid\ufffd. (Applause.) Good man. I told him that all Americans stand with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom. Yesterday, our administration launched the International Religious Freedom Alliance, the first-ever alliance devoted to promoting religious liberty. It was something. Really something. (Applause.) More than 25 countries have already joined our campaign. I want to thank Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, along with Ambassador Sam Brownback, who are both here this morning, for leading this historic initiative. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike. (Applause.) Thank you. All of us here today reaffirm these timeless truths: Faith keeps us free. Prayer makes us strong. And God alone is the author of life and the giver of grace. (Applause.) With us this morning is a pastor who embodies the miracle of faith and the power of prayer: Reverend Gerald Toussaint from Louisiana. Reverend Toussaint is an Army veteran, a truck driver, and a pastor. He leads the same church that his father led, Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, which has been a pillar of the community for more than 140 years. Last year, Mount Pleasant was one of three African American churches in Louisiana that was destroyed in a fire set by a wicked, hate-filled arsonist. Yet, in the wake of such shocking evil, America witnessed the unshakable unity, devotion, and spirit of Reverend Toussaint and his entire highly spirited, beautiful congregation. Families quickly came together in prayer. Soon, people from all across Louisiana came to help any way they could. Americans in all 50 states and 20 different countries heard about it and they donated more than $2 million to help rebuild Mount Pleasant , (applause) , and the other two churches that were (inaudible). On Easter Sunday, just days after he lost his church, Reverend Toussaint preached about what it all meant. What does it mean? 'The Easter season,' he said, 'is a fitting metaphor for recent events. It was dark the day that Jesus was crucified. It was dark night when they burned our church. What has happened since is like a resurrection.' Old things are gone, but it's going to be a brand-new start, and it's going to be better than ever, Reverend. (Applause.) Better than ever. Fantastic. And today, just 10 months later, the ground is cleared. Careful plans have been made, and they're beautiful plans. And construction is about to begin on the new and very, very magnificent Mount Pleasant Church. Congratulations. (Applause.) You know, the Reverend says that we're rebuilding because that's what Jesus does. He rebuilds, he lives, and he breathes. It's what he does. He wants it to be rebuilt. It was torn apart, but it's being rebuilt again, and I'll bet you it will indeed be bigger, better, and nicer than before. What do you think, Reverend? Yes? And it's going to have your mark on it. It did have and now it will have even great. And your father is looking down on you right now and he's very, very proud of the job that you've done. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Very much inspire us, Reverend. Thank you. Well, I want to just thank everybody. This has been very special. Tell your congregation that , and all of your people , that we have 350 million people in our country. They're proud Americans. And they respect what we're doing, even those that you don't think so much like us, respect us, want to be with us. They're respecting our fight, and we are in a fight. Religion in this country and religion all over the world , certain religions in particular , are under siege. We won't let that happen. We are going to protect our religions. We are going to protect Christianity. We are going to protect our great ministers and pastors and rabbis and all of the people that we so cherish and that we so respect. America is eternally in the debt of our nation's African American churches all throughout this country. That's why it's so fitting and so , it's one of the reasons we chose this particular church in Louisiana. For generations, they bravely fought for justice and lifted up the conscience of our nation. And we're grateful beyond any measure. But I can say that going beyond that, we're grateful to the people in this room for the love they show to religion. Not one religion, but many religions. They are brave. They are brilliant. They are fighters. They like people. And sometimes they hate people. I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm trying to learn. (Laughter.) It's not easy. It's not easy. (Applause.)When they impeach you for nothing, then you're supposed to like them? It's not easy, folks. (Laughter.) I do my best. But I'll tell you what we are doing: We're restoring hope and spreading faith. We're helping citizens of every background take part in the great rebuilding of our nation. We're declaring that America will always shine as a land of liberty and light unto all nations of the world. We want every nation to look up to us like they are right now. We were not a respected nation just a few years ago. We had lost our way. Our country is respected again by everybody. (Applause.) This morning, let us ask Father in Heaven to guide our steps, protect our children, and bless our families. And with all of our heart, let us forever embrace the eternal truth that every child is made equal by the hand of Almighty God. Thank you. God Bless you. And God bless America. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)"}

Seventy-five years later, we pay tribute to the immeasurable sacrifice of those killed in action on Iwo Jima, and we honor the heroic efforts of all who took part in one of the most costly and significant battles in our country's history. By February 1945, despite American forces possessing aerial and naval supremacy, the Japanese forces at Iwo Jima were well dug-in and prepared to fight to the last man for the strategically important airfields on this small piece of land. This was the first time in World War II that the Japanese were defending what they considered home soil. For 5 weeks, our Marines and Navy sailors endured a harrowing trial by fire, fighting to secure this remote volcanic island from more than 20,000 determined Japanese soldiers. Nearly 7,000 Americans died in the effort. The fighting on Iwo Jima was some of the bloodiest and most costly in all of World War II, but it also gave rise to some of the greatest examples of patriotism and heroism in our Nation's history, inspiring Admiral Chester Nimitz's famous statement that \"uncommon valor was a common virtue.\" Few images evoke as much emotion from the American soul as Joe Rosenthal's photo of six Marines raising our Flag atop Mount Suribachi in the opening days of the battle. In addition, 27 Medals of Honor, the highest honor given to members of the military, were awarded for actions of conspicuous gallantry during the battle. Of these, 22 medals went to Marines, making up more than 25 percent of the total Medals of Honor awarded to Marines throughout the entirety of the war. Among the heroes at Iwo Jima were non-combatants, like Rabbi Roland Gittelsohn. In the days following the battle, Rabbi Gittelsohn delivered a powerful, stirring message at the Fifth Marine Division cemetery on Iwo Jima. There, he stated, \"Here lie officers and privates, blacks and whites, rich and poor together. Here are Protestants, Catholics, and Jews together. Here no man prefers another because of his color.\" For his service ministering to men in the thick of the combat zone, Rabbi Gittelsohn was awarded three service ribbons, and today his words resonate as a powerful testament to the founding principle of our Nation that liberty and democracy are the rights of all men and women of every race, religion, and creed. On this anniversary, we honor those who answered the call of duty and ensured that the forces of freedom emerged victorious in that fateful battle.

IST PRESIDENT TRUMP: Namaste! Namaste. (Applause.) And hello to India. This is such a great honor. Let me begin by expressing my profound gratitude to an exceptional leader, a great champion of India, a man who works night and day for his country, and a man I am proud to call my true friend: Prime Minister Modi. (Applause.) The First Lady and I have just traveled 8,000 miles around the globe to deliver a message to every citizen across this nation: America loves India, America respects India, and America will always be faithful and loyal friends to the Indian people. (Applause.) Five months ago, the United States welcomed your great Prime Minister at a giant football stadium in Texas, and today, India welcomes us at the world's largest cricket stadium right here in Ahmedabad. (Applause.) It is a profound honor to be the beautiful new stadium, to be here with you , Motera Stadium. So beautiful. (Applause.) And joined by so many distinguished guests from all across your nation and all across the world. To the hundreds of thousands of everyday citizens who have come out and lined the streets in a stunning display of Indian culture and kindness, and to the 125,000 people in this great stadium today , (applause) , thank you for the spectacular welcome to your magnificent country. You have done a great honor to the American people. Melania and my family, we will always remember this remarkable hospitality. We will remember it forever. (Applause.) From this day on, India will always hold a very special place in our hearts. (Applause.) The life of Prime Minister Modi underscores the limitless promise of this great nation. He started out by his father's side as a chai wala , (applause) , a tea-seller. When he was a young man, he worked at a cafeteria in this city. AUDIENCE: Modi! Modi! Modi! PRESIDENT TRUMP: Stand up. (Applause.) Everybody loves him, but I will tell you this: He's very tough. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Today, Prime Minister Modi is the tremendously successful leader of this vast Indian Republic. Last year, more than 600 million people went to the polls and gave him a landslide victory like no other in the largest democratic election ever held anywhere on the face of the Earth. (Applause.) Prime Minister Modi, you are not just the pride of Gujarat , you are living proof that with hard work and devotion, Indians can accomplish anything , (applause) , anything at all, anything they want. (Applause.) The Prime Minister has a moving story of an incredible rise, and so does this entire nation. Your nation is doing so well. We are very, very proud of India. (Applause.) The story of the Indian nation is a tale of astounding progress, a miracle of democracy, extraordinary diversity, and above all, a strong and noble people. India gives hope to all of humanity. In just 70 years, India has become an economic giant, the largest democracy ever to exist, and one of the most amazing nations anywhere in the world. (Applause.) Since the turn of the century, India's economy has grown more than six times in size. In a single decade, India has lifted over 270 million people out of poverty. Under Prime Minister Modi, for the first time in history, every village in India now has access to electricity. (Applause.) Three hundred and twenty million people , more Indians , are right now connected to the Internet. (Applause.) The pace of highway construction has more than doubled. Over 70 million more households , think of this , 70 million more households have access to cooking fuel; 600 million more people have access to basic sanitation; and, incredibly, 12 Indian citizens are lifted out of extreme poverty every single minute of every single day. (Applause.) India will soon be the home of the biggest middle class anywhere in the world. And within less than 10 years, extreme poverty in your country is projected to completely disappear. (Applause.) The potential for India is absolutely incredible. India's rise as a prosperous and independent nation is an example to every nation all over the world and one of the most outstanding achievements of our century. It is all the more inspiring because you have done it as a democratic country, you have done it as a peaceful country, you have done it as a tolerant country, and you have done it as a great free country. (Applause.) There is all the difference in the world between a nation that seeks power through coercion, intimidation, and aggression, and a nation that rises by setting its people free and unleashing them to chase their dreams. And that is India. (Applause.) This is why India's accomplishment over the last 70 years is completely unrivaled no matter where you go. It is your faith in the strength of a free society, your confidence in your own people, your trust in your own citizens, and your respect for the dignity of every person that makes the United States and India such a natural, beautiful, enduring friendship. (Applause.) While our nations have many differences, they are both defined and propelled by a fundamental truth: the truth that all of us are blessed with divine light, and every person is endowed with a sacred soul. As the great religious teacher, Swami Vivekananda, once said , (applause) , \"The moment I stand in reverence before every human being and see God in Him, that moment I am free.\" (Applause.) In America and in India, we know that we are all born for a higher purpose: to reach toward our fullest potential, to work toward excellence and perfection, and to give all glory to God. Powered by this spirit, Indians and Americans are always striving to be greater, our people are always seeking to be better, and so our nations have become thriving centers of culture and commerce and civilization, giving light and vitality to all of the world. This is the country that produces nearly 2,000 movies a year from the hub of genius and creativity known as Bollywood! (Applause.) All over the planet, people take great joy in scenes of Bhangra music, dance, romance and drama, and classic Indian films like DDLJ and Sholay. (Applause.) This is the country where your people cheer on some of the world's greatest cricket players , from Sachin Tendulkar to Virat Kohli. (Applause.) The greatest in the world. This is the country that built the tallest statue on the face of the Earth to honor the namesake of this stadium, the great Indian patriot and native of this state, Sardar Patel. (Applause.) India is the country where hundreds of millions of , light candles to celebrate the triumph of good over evil at Diwali. (Applause.) And it's where, just days from now, Indians of all faiths will pour out onto the streets to celebrate the beautiful festival of Holi. (Applause.) India is a country that proudly embraces freedom, liberty, individual rights, the rule of law, and the dignity of every human being. Your nation has always been admired around the Earth as the place where millions upon millions of Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jains, Buddhists, Christians, and Jews worship side by side in harmony; where you speak more than 100 languages and come from more than two dozen states, yet you have always stood strong as one great Indian nation. (Applause.) Your unity is an inspiration to the world. In America, we have come to know the splendor of Indian culture personally, through the 4 million Indian Americans living in the United States as our wonderful friends, colleagues, and neighbors. They are truly spectacular people. (Applause.) Indian Americans enrich every aspect of our national life. They are titans of business; the biggest, the best pioneers of science; masters of the art; and innovation of technology like few people have been able to see no matter where you go anywhere in this universe. Nearly one in four Indian Americans trace their roots right here in Gujarat. (Applause.) Gujarat is a special place. So on behalf of the entire American people, thank you and thank you all for the contributions your culture and traditions have made to my beloved country. (Applause.) Americans are eager to strengthen these beautiful ties between our two people. This is truly an exciting time in the United States. Our economy is booming like never before. Our people are prospering and spirits are soaring. There is tremendous love, tremendous like. We like and we love everybody.Unemployment has hit historic lows, and small business confidence has hit an all-time record high in the history of our country. Our military has been completely rebuilt; it is now stronger than ever before. And we are quickly revitalizing our alliances and friendships all around the world. We have spent two and a half trillion dollars on rebuilding our military. It's the most powerful military anywhere in the world, by far. (Applause.) That is why I have come here to India, in the spirit of fondness and goodwill, to expand our cherished partnership of incredible power and potential. The First Lady and I have just had a pleasure of visiting Mahatma Gandhi's Ashram, a few miles from here, where he launched the famous \"Salt March.\" (Applause.) And tomorrow in Delhi, we will lay a wreath, plant a tree at Raj Ghat in honor of this leader who is revered all around the world. And the First Lady and I look forward to visiting one of your country's most iconic landmarks. We are later today going to see the majestic Taj Mahal. (Applause.) The Prime Minister and I will also continue our important discussions about how to deepen the relationship between our two great countries. Both of us understand that when leaders put the interests of their own citizens first, we can forge strong and fair partnerships to build a safer and more prosperous world. Just months ago, this critical partnership took a major step forward when the U.S. military and your brave Indian Armed Forces conducted the first-ever air, land, and sea military exercises between our two countries. It was something to behold. We called it \"Tiger Triumph.\" (Applause.) As we continue to build our defense cooperation, the United States looks forward to providing India with some of the best and most feared military equipment on the planet. We make the greatest weapons ever made: airplanes, missiles, rockets, ships. We make the best. And we're dealing now with India. But this includes advanced air defense systems and armed and unarmed aerial vehicles. And I am pleased to announce that, tomorrow, our representatives will sign deals to sell over $3 billion in the absolute finest, state-of-the-art military helicopters and other equipment to the Indian Armed Forces. (Applause.) I believe that the United States should be India's premier defense partner, and that's the way it's working out. Together, we will defend our sovereignty, security, and protect a free and open Indo-Pacific region for our children and for many, many generations to come. The United States and India are also firmly united in our ironclad resolve to defend our citizens from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. (Applause.) Both of our countries have been hurt by the pain and turmoil of terrorism and that terrorism brings. Under my administration, we unleashed the full power of the American military on bloodthirsty killers of ISIS in Iraq and in Syria. (Applause.) Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed. And the monster known as al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of ISIS, is dead. (Applause.) In the United States, we have also made clear that while our country will always welcome newcomers who share our values and love our people, our borders will always be closed to terrorists and terrorism and to any form of extremism. That is why we have taken historic steps to improve screening and vetting of applications for entry, and we are working to ensure that anyone who threatens the security of our citizens is denied admission and will pay a very, very big, costly price. (Applause.) Every nation has the right to secure and controlled borders. The United States and India are committed to working together to stop terrorists and to fight their ideology. (Applause.) For this reason, since taking office, my administration is working in a very positive way with Pakistan to crack down on the terrorist organizations and militants that operate on the Pakistani border. (Applause.) Our relationship with Pakistan is a very good one. Thanks to these efforts, we are beginning to see signs of big progress with Pakistan. And we are hopeful for reduced tensions, greater stability, and the future of harmony for all of the nations of South Asia. India has an important leadership role to play in shaping a better future as you take on greater responsibility for solving problems and promoting peace throughout this incredible region. Over the course of my visit, Prime Minister Modi and I will also discuss our efforts to expand the economic ties between our two countries. We will be making very, very major , among the biggest ever made , trade deals. (Applause.) We are in the early stages of discussion for an incredible trade agreement to reduce barriers of investment between the United States and India. And I am optimistic that, working together, the Prime Minister and I can reach a fantastic deal that's good and even great for both of our countries. (Applause.) Except that he's a very tough negotiator. (Laughs.) Since my inauguration, commerce between our two nations has increased by more than 40 percent. India is now a major market for American exports, and the United States is India's largest export market. (Applause.) A booming America is great thing for India and it's great for the world. And that's why we're so happy to announce that we have the greatest economy ever in the history of the United States. In America, we have proven that the best way to attract jobs and opportunity is to reduce burdens on business, knock down barriers to new investment, and eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy, red tape, regulation, and taxes. Prime Minister Modi has already made significant reforms here in your country, as you very well know. The world looks forward to even more rapid improvement to India's business climate under his leadership. He wants to do it, and he's doing it at a record pace. Two years ago, Prime Minister Modi warmly welcomed my daughter Ivanka to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad. And she is back with us today. Ivanka, thank you. Thank you for being here, honey. (Applause.) We are delighted to be joined as well by dozens of Indian women entrepreneurs who are helping to build your nation's future. They are great and natural entrepreneurs. And I just say to the men: Be very careful. They're really good. (Applause.) The United States and India are also working closely together on the future of space exploration. You are making impressive strides with your exciting Chandrayaan Lunar Program. (Applause.) It is moving along rapidly, far ahead of schedule, and America looks forward to expanding our space cooperation with India as you push even further. You are pushing the limits , and that's a great thing , including in realm of human spaceflight. (Applause.) The United States and India will be friends and partners on our voyage into the stars and into space. It is truly extraordinary what this nation has achieved in the span of just one lifetime. And what they have done under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, it is absolutely incredible. Mr. Prime Minister, congratulations. (Applause.) Fantastic. You have come so far, but it is nothing compared to with how far India will go into the future. And the Prime Minister is laying the foundations for a future like few other countries can even think of. This nation is blessed with many treasures. From the sacred banks of the Ganges, to the Golden Temple, and the Jama Masjid, it is home to some of the most cherished cultural heritage anywhere on Earth. It is also a land of stunning vistas and astonishing natural wonders, from the rugged peaks of the Himalayas to the splendid shores of Goa. (Applause.) And India has always been a wellspring of deep wisdom and great ideas , from the Vedas and the ancient epics, all the way up to the modern India nation. But standing before all of you today, I know that true strength of India is not found in its textbooks, its landmarks or its landscapes. The true strength of India is found in 125,000 beating hearts in this stadium and the millions and millions of people who have seen and witnessed our great friendship and admiration today. It is all found in the soul and the spirit of the Indian people. Your courage won and secured this nation's independence. Your devotion built this great and enduring democracy. And it is your dreams that will power this country to a future , even greater progress, prosperity, equality, and opportunity for every citizen across your land. So today I say to every Indian , North and South, Hindu and Muslim, Jewish and Christian, rich and poor, young and old: Take pride in the glories of your past, unite for an even brighter future, and let our two nations always stand together as powerful defenders of peace and liberty, and the hope of a better world for all of humanity. Thank you again, Prime Minister Modi, for your hospitality. And thank you, India, for this phenomenal welcome. (Applause.) I want to just leave by saying: God bless India. God bless the United States of America. We love you. We love you, India, very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) END 2:22 P.M.

Namaste. (Applause.) And hello to India. This is such a great honor. Let me begin by expressing my profound gratitude to an exceptional leader, a great champion of India, a man who works night and day for his country, and a man I am proud to call my true friend: Prime Minister Modi. (Applause.) The First Lady and I have just traveled 8,000 miles around the globe to deliver a message to every citizen across this nation: America loves India, America respects India, and America will always be faithful and loyal friends to the Indian people. (Applause.) Five months ago, the United States welcomed your great Prime Minister at a giant football stadium in Texas, and today, India welcomes us at the world's largest cricket stadium right here in Ahmedabad. (Applause.) It is a profound honor to be the beautiful new stadium, to be here with you , Motera Stadium. So beautiful. (Applause.) And joined by so many distinguished guests from all across your nation and all across the world. To the hundreds of thousands of everyday citizens who have come out and lined the streets in a stunning display of Indian culture and kindness, and to the 125,000 people in this great stadium today , (applause) , thank you for the spectacular welcome to your magnificent country.

From this day on, India will always hold a very special place in our hearts. (Applause.) The life of Prime Minister Modi underscores the limitless promise of this great nation. He started out by his father's side as a chai wala , (applause) , a tea-seller. When he was a young man, he worked at a cafeteria in this city. AUDIENCE: Modi! Modi! Modi! PRESIDENT TRUMP: Stand up. (Applause.) Everybody loves him, but I will tell you this: He's very tough. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Today, Prime Minister Modi is the tremendously successful leader of this vast Indian Republic. Last year, more than 600 million people went to the polls and gave him a landslide victory like no other in the largest democratic election ever held anywhere on the face of the Earth. (Applause.) Prime Minister Modi, you are not just the pride of Gujarat , you are living proof that with hard work and devotion, Indians can accomplish anything , (applause) , anything at all, anything they want. (Applause.) The Prime Minister has a moving story of an incredible rise, and so does this entire nation. Your nation is doing so well. We are very, very proud of India. (Applause.) The story of the Indian nation is a tale of astounding progress, a miracle of democracy, extraordinary diversity, and above all, a strong and noble people. India gives hope to all of humanity. In just 70 years, India has become an economic giant, the largest democracy ever to exist, and one of the most amazing nations anywhere in the world. (Applause.) Since the turn of the century, India's economy has grown more than six times in size. In a single decade, India has lifted over 270 million people out of poverty. Under Prime Minister Modi, for the first time in history, every village in India now has access to electricity. (Applause.) Three hundred and twenty million people , more Indians , are right now connected to the Internet. (Applause.) The pace of highway construction has more than doubled. Over 70 million more households , think of this , 70 million more households have access to cooking fuel; 600 million more people have access to basic sanitation; and, incredibly, 12 Indian citizens are lifted out of extreme poverty every single minute of every single day. (Applause.) India will soon be the home of the biggest middle class anywhere in the world. And within less than 10 years, extreme poverty in your country is projected to completely disappear. (Applause.) The potential for India is absolutely incredible. India's rise as a prosperous and independent nation is an example to every nation all over the world and one of the most outstanding achievements of our century. It is all the more inspiring because you have done it as a democratic country, you have done it as a peaceful country, you have done it as a tolerant country, and you have done it as a great free country. (Applause.) There is all the difference in the world between a nation that seeks power through coercion, intimidation, and aggression, and a nation that rises by setting its people free and unleashing them to chase their dreams. And that is India. (Applause.) This is why India's accomplishment over the last 70 years is completely unrivaled no matter where you go. It is your faith in the strength of a free society, your confidence in your own people, your trust in your own citizens, and your respect for the dignity of every person that makes the United States and India such a natural, beautiful, enduring friendship.

And I'm thrilled to back at CPAC with the thousands of proud American patriots who love our country, respect our flag , (applause) , honor our history, uphold our laws, protect our Constitution, and always put America first. Right? (Applause.) Been a long time. We had a great night yesterday in South Carolina. That was incredible. We filled up a stadium like you haven't seen. The stadium was packed and thousands of people outside. And I saw the competitors , our competitors. They'd have like two people on a street corner. (Laughter.) That's , it's incredible what's going on. This is a movement like , honestly, like nobody has ever seen before. We say that , we say that , (applause) , and, you know, if it wasn't so, the fake news media would be all over us, right? They'd say \"It wasn't so. He exaggerated.\" I say it all the time. They never change it. You know, every once in a while, you see somebody who did well , let's say \"well\" in New Hampshire or did well , not even win it , in Iowa, and the whole life of that person is made because we won the election. We did well in those places. Sit down, everybody, if you want. Sit down. (Laughter.) We won the election. (Applause.) So it's great. And I came here and I got to know Matt and Mercedes early on and I made a speech, before I thought about doing this. I said, \"Would you speak?\" I was very famous then, too. (Laughter.) I guess more famous now. But I was very famous, and I made a speech and they liked the speech. They said, \"You ought to run for President.\" I said, \"No thanks.\" You remember that, Matt? \"You ought to run for President.\" We had a big crowd. And it was , \"The Apprentice\" was doing so well. It was like a hot, to put it mildly, show. (Laughter.) And Matt said, \"You ought to run for President.\" I said, \"Let me give it a little thought.\" (Laughter.) And a couple of years later, we said, \"Let's do it.\" And then they said , (applause) , I never forget one of the people, respected guy, Charles Krauthammer. (Applause.) Right? He said on , well, this isn't so good, but he said on Fox , he said, \"No, why would he do this? You have 17 of the most talented professionals ever assembled that are running. Why would he run? He's not going to run, and if he does, he's only doing it for fun.\" You think this has been fun? Does anybody , (laughter) , does anybody think , Mercedes, do think this has been fun? I don't think , you know. This has been just a ball. We've had a ball. (Laughter.) But you know what? You know what? We're doing so well and we're doing so much. No administration has ever done what we've done in the first three years. Nobody. (Applause.) With tax cuts and Supreme Court judges and 218 judges , roughly, 218 including D.C. But together, we're defeating the radical socialist Democrats, the fake news media, the crooked politicians, and the hate-filled left-wing mob. And I told you I was going to be nice today. See? (Laughter.) I said, \"Let's be nice today.\" It's hard to be nice when they treat you so badly, right? Only a fool is nice when they treat you so badly. We're defending our faith, our values, our heritage, our borders, our rights, and our God-given freedoms. We're doing that. This is an incredible , look at all those people back there. This place has grown. Look. Wow. (Applause.) Wow. That's fantastic. I don't know who they are, Matt, but they must be very special, this little group over here. (Applause.) For Matt to block out half the arena for this group of people. (Laughter.) I'm trying to figure out, who are they? At first, I thought they were the fake news. I said, \"It's too bad they such a good location.\" (Laughter.) I don't know who you are but you're very important. (Laughter.) It's true. Very important people. We're exposing the corruption of the Washington Democrats and we're draining the Washington swamp. (Applause.) I just didn't know how dirty it would be. I didn't know how deep it would be when I said, \"Drain the swamp.\" For a long time , you know, I was given that expression. A speechwriter gave it to me. He said, \"Drain the swamp.\" I said, \"That's so hokey.\" (Laughter.) I said, \"That's the worst. I don't want to use it.\" Anyway, it ends up in one of the speeches. I said, \"We will drain the swamp.\" Right? The place went crazy. (Laughter.) I said, \"Let's try it again.\" (Laughter.) And we did it again and the place went crazy. Now, here's the bad part, I never knew the swamp was so bad. It's really bad. But we're winning, and we're winning not easy, but we're winning. (Applause.) A lot of dirty people. A lot of very bad people. A lot of bad people. And I think , I think justice will be had. I do believe that, or I wouldn't be very happy right now. We got through everything. We've got through , they gave us the Mueller hoax. They gave us the Russia, Russia, Russia crap. They gave us the one phone call that was a perfect phone call. \"Oh, let's get him out of office for that phone call.\" But, you know, the Republicans stuck together, except Romney of course. You know, Romney. AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: Lowlife. Lowlife. Except Romney, they stuck together. And even him, I got half a vote, so, you know. (Laughter.) See, I say , I was thinking, because he did actually vote one (inaudible). He couldn't do it all, you know, because he wanted to get some nice free publicity for himself. But it was 52 and a half out of 53 votes. (Laughter.) True. I guess you can say that, right? Fifty two and a half, right? So think of it: The Republicans were fantas- , I tell you what. That's when you din out who your friends are, really. It is. And we had 52 and a half votes. And in the House we had 107 , think of it , 107 to nothing with the Republicans. 107 to nothing. And we got three Democrats. And one came over and left the Democrat Party: Van Drew. Jeff Van Drew. (Applause.) And really, together, we're preserving this exceptional nation that our ancestors fought and died to build. We are making America greater than ever before. We really are. I think it's going to be greater than ever before with what we're doing with our military and what we're doing also to get rid of very bad people. We have such bad people, and they're not , they're not people that love our country. We're getting people that really love our country, and it's so important. And if I wasn't able to fulfill that, no matter what other things we've done, I would not consider this journey to be a success. So just remember that. (Applause.) One of my most important promises to the American people was to end America's long-running wars in the Middle East. American forces , and we're all warriors, folks, but 19 years. I see the people; I go over and I say hello to those incredible soldiers over at Walter Reed. What talent you have at Walter Reed. Those doctors, by the way, they have to be the best in the world , what they can do. (Applause.) And I see the arms and the legs missing, and I see what's happened to some of these incredible, beautiful people, and I see the strength, the spirit , the spirit that they have. Most of them , I mean, even if they can't walk, if they've lost both legs, they want to go back. \"Sir, we want to go back. I want to go back.\" And it's just incredible to see it. And I'm going to mention it a little bit later, but, you know, we knocked out Soleimani, the father of the roadside bomb. (Applause.) We killed him and al-Baghdadi. And al-Baghdadi. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT: Soleimani was , Soleimani was the , they called him \"the father of the roadside bomb.\" He thought it was great. \"Oh, the great bomb.\" And, you know, he thought it was great. It kept getting bigger and more sophisticated. One young man, he said, \"My last day , it was my last day in Afghanistan.\" And they had the mine detectors. And he said, \"I trusted this man with my life. He was the best. I've never seen anything like it. He could detect those. We felt so safe.\" But, unfortunately, his last day, they made them out of plastic so you couldn't detect them, and it went off. Killed the man who was the detector, and badly, badly injured a lot of people, and he was one of them. And he said, \"Think of it, sir.\" I said, \"Why did it go off?\" He said, \"Because they made it out of plastic, and the plastic doesn't get detected by the metal detector.\" And that was the last day, and he lost his legs. But we took that son of a bitch out, didn't we? (Applause.) It should have been done a long time ago. That should have been done a long time ago. That should have been done a long time ago. And al-Baghdadi, he's the father of ISIS, and we defeated ISIS in the Middle East. We have defeated 100 percent of the caliphate. (Applause.) But we said to the Europeans, \"Hey, take your soldiers.\" We killed many, many terrorists. When I took over, by the way, it was a mess. There was so much. If they , I hate to say this, Republicans, but they had maps and it was all red. Red meant ISIS. I hate to say it. I said, \"Let's change the color.\" I actually did change the color. (Laughter.) But they showed me maps and large portions of Iraq and Syria, ISIS. And we don't want them ever to come here. And I had some great people and have some incredible generals. And I had a decision to make, because that was just not , they were not doing it right. And we made the decision, and we took them out. Remember, I got to 98 percent and I said, \"All right, now I can bring our people home.\" \"Sir \" And then what happened is the press; they didn't care. But they went crazy. \"He didn't complete the job.\" I was at 98 percent, Matt. They said, \"He didn't complete the job.\" I said, \"General, complete the job.\" And they completed the job. (Applause.) But the Europeans should be helping us, because many of those people that we're guarding now , thousands and thousands of ISIS fighters and others , and many of those people will go home to France and Germany and UK and others. And we say, \"Take them.\" \"No, no, no, we don't want to them.\" See, this is it , we do things for other people and then they forget, our allies. Sometimes our allies treat us worse than our enemies. I hate to say this to you, but sometimes they do. It's very sad. Did them a big favor, but that's all right. It's all working out very well. But we took out al-Baghdadi, who everybody was after. That was , you'd see him all the time speaking with a fan. That was an old picture , he was young. He got older. But they were looking for him for 16 years. And one of the first things I said when I came in is, \"You got to find this guy, al-Baghdadi.\" \"Yes, sir.\" All of a sudden, they walk in, they said, \"We have him, sir. We're following him all over the Middle East.\" He'd move from place to place to place. \"We're following him, sir.\" And then they said, \"Sir, we have him.\" And I had to give an order and I gave an order. And I'll tell you what: Sixty-six of the most incredible soldiers you've ever seen. They went in on eight helicopters. And, you know, in modern-day warfare, you can watch. I mean, I'm watching it. I'm watching it from the Situation Room. You believe it? It was like , you can't make a movie like this. (Laughter.) For instance, there's no dog like Conan. No dog. (Applause.) There's no dog like Conan, right? In fact, Conan, after the operation, was a tremendous success. I mean, they were looking for him for a long time. And it was a lot of violent fighting, and then ultimately we got him. He was in a tunnel, at the end of the tunnel. And Conan was going after him. Conan almost was electrocuted. You know that story. But the guys went after him, and we got him. But you wouldn't believe how great it felt. And when you saw the professionalism that of these soldiers, I can't even tell you. There's , nobody has a military like we have. There's nobody with the talent that we have. It's incredible. (Applause.) They got him, and he knew it. He knew it. He knew it. As soon as he heard that first little explosion , that took them about three seconds , that blew the hell out of the wall. I said, \"Why don't they go through the front door?\" He said, \"Sir, you go through the front door, you got a lot of bullets coming at you.\" They went through a solid concrete wall. They put stuff up, boom. So fast. (Laughter.) So now they're shooting the other guys from behind. That's much better, right? (Laughter.) Guys are saying, \"Who's that? Who's that?\" (Laughter and applause.) Guys were unbelievable. You don't have a movie like that. And Conan actually , Conan was given more press than your President , I'm telling you. (Laughter.) It was like about a half-a-day story. If somebody else would have done it, it would have been the greatest thing to ever happen. But that's all right. I do it for a different reason. I do it because we have to, to keep ourselves safe. I do it also for all of the people that they killed and wounded. Right? (Applause.) They killed and wounded a lot of people. But American forces cannot be the policemen for the entire world. We're all over the world. And a lot of times, we're not even appreciated. It's taken for granted. We can't be the policemen for the world and the democracy builders. We just can't do that for every nation that seems to have difficulty, especially for those nations that don't appreciate what we do , and there are many of them. Many of them. And that goes with trade also. We've changed the whole thing around. Their job is to be secure, and my job is to make sure that we're secure and to defend our country first. Our country. Today, the United States , (applause) , for years, they've been trying to do this, and today the United States signed a deal with the Taliban so that we can hopefully begin the immediate process of finally bringing our troops back home. (Applause.) Nineteen years. Nineteen years where they're , thank you. And as you know, others wanted to do it. We got it done and just signed it. And I want to thank a lot of people. We really have to thank , you know who we have to thank? The families and those incredible people that lost their lives, to start off with, okay? (Applause.) Those incredible families , I've gotten to know so many families. And we have to thank our wounded warriors that came home missing limbs and serious, serious things. Our great wounded warriors. We're taking good care of them, too. (Applause.) And I want to just thank our military because, you know, we've been, really, a police force there for the last long time. And we're not supposed to be a police force. We're supposed to be fighting soldiers. And we could win that war very easily if we wanted to lose , kill a million people that have nothing to do with it, that don't know anything about us. And it's really a great feeling. I saw it. I watched the ceremony today, early in the morning, on our television. And Mike Pompeo, Secretary. State. (Applause.) Secretary of Defense Esper is doing a great job. So Pompeo and Esper were actually in different locations signing with different groups. And pretty complicated deal, I have to be honest. But in exchange for the Taliban's action against al Qaeda and other terrorists who could threaten us, we're prepared to begin those force withdrawals. And if the Taliban and the Afghan government live up to their commitments , and they may or they may not, but I think we have a lot of reason why they will. I think they will. That means that the longest war in American history, by far , it's not even close , will be over. (Applause.) And again, the agreement was made possible by the extraordinary bravery of our , of our American warriors. The sacrifice of these incredible people and their allies. And I want to also thank , I will say this: NATO came in and Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO. You know, we had 28 , essentially 28 , countries participating in this, and they're very happy to be out. They're very happy to be , soon to be doing other things. And I'll say this for the Taliban: They're great fighters. You know that. Obviously, they're great fighters. All you have to do is ask the Soviet Union, \"Are they great fighters?\" (Laughter.) \"They are great fighters.\" But they , they're tired also. They , this is 19 years. Nineteen years. So, I'm very happy to announce that this group in particular , it's just, sort of , I should say we scheduled it for our CPAC day. (Laughter.) You know? We scheduled it for CPAC, because what better place? (Applause.) But we salute those who gave their lives, and we salute all of those incredible people. And after years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own American citizens. (Applause.) It's time, right? It's time. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT: You remember recently when I took the soldiers out of Syria, and everyone said, \"Well we have to protect the border between Turkey and Syria.\" I said, \"Why? Why? What does it have to do with us? They've been fighting for 1,000 years. What does it have to do with us? Why are we protecting the border?\" \"You can't do that.\" I did it. (Laughter.) We created a safe zone. And I did leave a number of soldiers because we kept the oil. There's oil there, and we kept the oil, if it's okay. So they say, \"He left soldiers there.\" No, no, I left soldiers to keep the oil, okay? (Laughter.) They don't want to say that. They like to say, \"He kept soldiers there. He , he didn't tell the truth.\" These people are the worst. (Laughter.) They are the worst. It would be so much easier for our country if we had a press that told the truth. It would be so much easier. (Applause.) True. Right? It's true. And we're also committed to ensuring that those who mean to do us harm as a nation, even as individuals, are denied admission to America. They're not allowed into our country. And we have some very, very powerful people. Right now our borders are strong. All of the 9\/11 hijackers came here on visas, and we're determined to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. (Applause.) Right? And we're keeping them out. Border security is also health security. In our efforts to keep America safe, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to control our borders and protect Americans from the coronavirus. (Applause.) Came from China. In the early stages of the foreign outbreak, I ordered sweeping travel restrictions to prevent uncontrolled spread of this disease. I took a lot of heat, because I did it very early. You know, we had never done it before, Matt. Never done it before. And we had never done anything like that before. So not only did we do it, but I did it very early. And that decision has been now given very good grades, like an A-plus- plus-plus. (Applause.) I took a lot of heat, even from my own people. But we did the right thing. The extreme fringes called us \"racists\" for imposing these critical lifesaving measures. They wanted to let infected people pour into our country. I don't think they knew how bad it was, in all fairness, but nothing will deter us from protecting the wellbeing of the American people. (Applause.) My job is to protect Americans and also, very crucially, in this case, to protect Americans' health. And we'll do that. And we will do it with the vigor. That is why, today, my admin- , (applause) , right, thank you. That is why, today, my administration announced new measures to protect Americans to the fullest extent possible. In addition to the existing ban on travel by most Iranian nationals, we're banning the travel of anyone who has been to Iran in the last 14 days. They're having a very big outbreak. (Applause.) And I say here and now, if we can help the Iranians , we're doing certain things for them now , and if we can help the Iranians , we have the greatest healthcare professionals in the world , and if we can help the Iranians with this problem, we are certainly willing to do so. We would love to be able to help them. And all they have to do is ask. We will have great professionals over there. We have the best in the world. (Applause.) And we're raising the State Department travel advisories for South Korea and Italy, unfortunately, including a level four , that's the highest: \"Do not travel.\" It's a \"do not travel\" advisory for several areas of both countries. There are two areas of each country that is very heavily infected. And we are urging Americans to exercise increased caution throughout all of Europe. We will do everything in our power to keep the virus, and those carrying the infections, from entering our country. As you know, we took in approximately 40 people; they were Americans. And they may have had it. Some had it, but they will put in quarantine, and it's working out. Many of them are in good shape right now, and they're better and going home. It's time for all Americans to put politics aside and to come together to work for the health, safety, and security of the American people. They're great people. (Applause.) Because, you know, I watch , and maybe it's a natural reflex , but I watch , because we have done a great job. I mean, if nothing else, making that very early decision weeks , weeks early. And we've done a great job. And I've gotten to know these professionals. They're incredible. And everything is under control. I mean, they're very, very cool. They've done it, and they've done it well. Everything is really under control. But when they put a mic in front of a Democrat, and the Democrat said , doesn't even know what's going on. \"How is Trump doing?\" \"He's doing a terrible job.\" Well, sadly, I'd probably say the same about them. (Laughter.) You know? (Applause.) I guess it's a natural reflex. \"How is Donald Trump doing, Nervous Nancy?\" (Laughter.) \"He's doing a terrible job. It's terrible.\" Cryin' Chuck Schumer, I mean, he goes , he sees a mic, he'll run 200 yards to get to a mic. (Laughter.) He always did. In New York, same thing. He'd run hundreds of yards to find a mic. And then he'd start screaming, \"He's doing a terrible job.\" What job? \"I don't know. What's he working on now?\" (Laughter.) No, we have to be able to do , this is a different kind of a deal. I mean, you know, it's , we've made great deals. We've made great trade deals. Great everything. But this is different. We've got to be very careful with this stuff. And if we're doing a good job , and it's really the professionals , they have to be given a lot of credit for it because a lot of people wouldn't be able to do it. So we have to make it nonpartisan if we can. (Applause.) In just three short years under my administration, we've already achieved unprecedented victories and unrivaled gains for our citizens. As I said in my State of the Union Address, we are in the midst of a \"great American comeback.\" That's what is happening. (Applause.) Our economy is roaring, jobs are booming, opportunity is soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, and America is stronger today than ever before. Stronger today. (Applause.) Our military is incredible. We have rebuilt our incredible U.S. military, revived our industrial might, and restored our standing in the world. America is respected again, respected like never before. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT: Since my election, America has gained 7 million new jobs, 5 million more than government experts projected at the end of the last administration. They were saying the most you could possibly do is 2 million; we did 7 million. (Applause.) I never even said we were going to do 7 million. That's a lot of jobs. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over 51 years. The average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any President in the history of the United States. (Applause.) That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows , all record lows. Every one, lowest ever. (Applause.) Young people have seen their wages increased by 16 percent. A record. And their wages are rising three times faster than those wages. During the last four years of , did you ever hear of this gentleman? , the Obama administration. You ever hear of him? AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: More than 2 million millennials have gotten jobs. We have lifted 10 million people off the welfare rolls and 7 million people off of food stamps. (Applause.) And under the so-called Trump economy, we are actually achieving the progress, hope, and change that liberals have been falsely promising for decades but utterly failed to deliver or produce. And it's really driving them crazy. (Laughter and applause.) That's why we'll probably end up with Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie. He's crazy. We got some beauties. We got Sleepy Joe. We got Crazy Bernie. We got Mini Mike, but I think he's out of it. (Laughter.) I would like to spend $700 million and end up with nothing. (Laughter.) Mini Mike. I know him well. I knew that was going to happen. That was probably the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates. Do we agree? Has there ever been anything like , (applause) , but he's going to keep spending the money. I think, this weekend, he's going to , I hear his ads stop on Tuesday. He's going for Tuesday. He's going to spend a lot of money. It just shows you that you can't buy an election. I mean, it just , there's a point in which people say, \"You got to bring the goods a little bit, too. You got to bring the goods.\" Boy, did Pocahontas destroy him. I'll tell you. (Laughter.) And look what I did to her. (Laughter.) She choked. You know, she went out and got a test because I was killing her with the Pocahontas. (Laughter.) Remember, I said, \"I have more Indiana blood in me than she does and I have none\"? (Laughter.) Right? I said it. I said it. (Applause.) Would love to have some but I have none. And she was getting hit with that name, \"Pocahontas.\" That was one of the good ones. (Laughter.) And they said, \"We want you to apologize for that name.\" And I did. I apologized. Nobody ever heard me apologize before. (Laughter.) I apologized to the real Pocahontas. I apologized. (Laughter.) But she went out and she said, \"Oh, this guy is killing me.\" Remember, she was dropping like a rock. (Laughter.) But I learned something: Never do it too early. Two , a year and a half before the election, I said, \"What am I doing? I should have saved it.\" But that's all right. Because she had those burning embers and then she started, but ultimately she failed. She's gone soon. But she was really mean to Mini Mike. I'll tell you, the way she treated him. He didn't know what hit him. (Laughter.) He's going, \"Oh, get me off of this stage.\" (Laughter.) \"Get me off! Get me off of this stage!\" (Laughter and applause.) It's true. It's true. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. We hit a nerve there, right? (Laughter.) Bad guy. Far-left radicals have become increasingly desperate and increasingly dangerous in their quest to transform America into a country you would not recognize, a country in which they control every aspect of American life. Just as socialist and communist movements have done all over the world, they're cracking down on all dissent and demanding absolute conformity. They want total control. They want to massively raise your taxes, bury you in regulations, take over American healthcare, indoctrinate our children from kindergarten to college , and you see that happening. Kids are coming home saying, \"What's going on here, dad?\" The kids get it. But eventually, they can be taught, unfortunately. Impose a fanatical code of political correctness, bombard our citizens with fake-news propaganda, and implement policies that would turn America, very quickly, into a large-scale Venezuela. AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: They want to take away your money, take away your choice, take away your speech, take away your guns, take away your religion, take away your history, take away your future, and take away, ultimately, your freedom. AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: But we will never let them do that. (Applause.) For many years, the radical left's sustained assault on American democracy, culture, institutions, and values went unanswered, but now we are fighting back, and we are winning like never before. We're here. We are winning. You know? There was a time I used to come to CPAC; it didn't have this kind of energy. Number one, you didn't have the President. (Laughter.) You know, I was only going to do this for Matt once. (Laughter.) I said, \"Look, I'm President. I can't go to CPAC.\" Right, Matt? I said, \"I can't do it.\" So I did it. We had a great time. Next day he calls, \"Can you do it again next year?\" I said, \"Yeah, I guess. (Laughter and applause.) This is like my fourth time or something, right? Or more. Or more. And I'll be here next year. Okay? (Applause.) Huh? Why not? AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. From the moment I took the Oath of Office, the left has pursued a relentless crusade to overturn the results of the 2016 election and sabotage our next election. You know that. It was all a big hoax. You know that. Disgraceful. We caught the dirty cop on top. Had I not fired Comey, it would have been a whole different story. Would have been a whole different story. (Applause.) That was a great firing. I'll tell you, a lot of people said, \"Oh you shouldn't have done that.\" No, no, no, just the opposite. We didn't fire him. Remember the insurance policy? Right? Right? Remember that? My friend over there , you are the greatest. Thank you very much stand up please. Look at him. Look at , does everybody know Jeffrey? Jeffrey Lord. What a great guy. (Applause.) He used to defend me on CNN, and then he defended me just a little bit too much. And they said, \"Jeffrey, get the hell out.\" And thank goodness you're on Fox now. Right? (Applause.) He used to defend me. He used to say, \"He's better than Ronald Reagan.\" And that was enough for Jeffrey. That was the end. They were , \"Get out of here, Jeffrey.\" (Laughter.) \"We don't want you anymore.\" He was too good. Thank you. Thank you for being here too, Jeffrey. They're coming after me, and we fight them back. And now we're going after them because we have no choice. We have to straighten out our country. (Applause.) But despite the best efforts of the left-wing fanatics, their scams, schemes, slanders , they've all been discredited. Totally discredited. How's Comey doing? How is , by the way, how is Bob Mueller doing? That was a great performance in Congress. (Laughter.) \"Raise your right hand.\" \"What?\" (Laughter.) \"Did you want a job in the White House running the FBI?\" \"Uh, no.\" Oh, he did. He did. He did. What happened to him? That was a lie. That was a lie. We have it down. He said, \"No, no.\" It was a lie. He wanted a job. He wanted to be Director of the FBI. And then they appointed him the following day into special counsel. I call it \"special prosecutor\" because special prosecutor is a much more accurate name. What they did to us , what they tried to do , and yet, can you imagine with all of that , going through all of that with a cloud over your head like nobody has ever had, for us to have seriously done more than any other administration? I mean, it's sort of a miracle when you think. (Applause.) Sort of a miracle or it's a toughness, or it's something. (Applause.) Maybe it's right there, right? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, God. (Applause.) How did we do that? How did we do it? Best economy, greatest military, greatest tax cuts in history, greatest regulation cuts in history. All those judges , those as beautiful judges. (Applause.) Two Supreme Court judges. (Applause.) Great ones. But their sinister plots have been exposed and their credibility has been totally destroyed. They're still just dealing with the embers, you know? A little bit like Pocahontas. She had those embers. And she started coming up, and that was the end. But they have embers too. They have embers. They have a lot of bad people around. But one by one. With the help of everyone here today, the American Dream is back bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. It's true. (Applause.) It's true. To lift up forgotten and impoverished communities, we created nearly 9,000 Opportunities Zones all across our country , Tim Scott , Senator Tim Scott was so great , (applause) , creating jobs, opportunity, and investment. It's now pouring into the places that needed it the most. We have poor areas that haven't had 10 cents invested in them in years and years and years. And now millions of dollars are going in there. We're transforming neighborhoods. It's incredible. It's incredible. (Applause.) It's one of the , it's not talked about much by the media. It's one of the greatest things ever done in terms of economic development: Opportunities Zones. Millions and millions of dollars are being poured and not being poured in by the federal government. Not being poured in by the federal government. It's an incredible thing. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history, larger than any before. And it's incredible. You know, all my life , I've only been doing this for five years, okay? , but all my life, I've watched politics. And it was always the guy that cut taxes , you want to cut taxes. The Democrats have a strange platform: They don't want a wall; they want people to pour in. They want to raise your taxes, right? They say, \"We want to raise taxes.\" I'm trying to say, \"Is this like a good thing to campaign on?\" (Laughter.) They want to raise taxes. Right? Think of it: They want to have sanctuary cities where you protect bad people, in many cases. The sanctuary cities. And, by the way, we just want the big case. Did you see that? (Applause.) Whoa. Two days ago. If they have a sanctuary city and they don't do what we need for law enforcement, we don't have to pay them any of that money. That's billions and billions and billions. (Applause.) Wow. Where did that come from? Where did that come from? And 40 million American families are enjoying an average of $2,200 more in their pocket thanks to a beautiful thing that Republicans really don't know about too much. You know, the Democrats like to take credit. It's called \"child tax credit.\" We took that. That was Ivanka Trump , right, Mercedes? Ivanka Trump. She wanted that so badly. (Applause.) We've cut a record number of job-killing regulations because regulation is stealth taxation, especially on the poor. We have cut more regulations in this administration in three years than any administration has cut in four years, in eight years, or in one case, longer than that. You know, who that was: good, old FDR. We've ended the war on American energy. American energy was under siege. And I'll tell you what: We don't want to talk negatively, but if for any reason any of these characters get in there, you can forget , I mean, I don't know how you're going to win Texas, by the way. I don't know how you're going to win Pennsylvania, by the way. (Applause.) I don't. They want to , they don't want petroleum products. Other than that, they're wonderful, right? How about this great character, Beto, right? Beto. Everyone thought , remember he said, \"I was born to run. I was born.\" He was born. Guy was a disaster. He said, \"I was born.\" Anybody that says he was \"born to run\" , he was born to do what I'm doing. Anybody that , I don't even say it and I won one. (Laughter.) It's true. No, it's so presumptuous. \"I was born to run for President.\" Well, then he came out against guns, religion, and oil, and he comes from Texas. And I said, \"Abraham Lincoln couldn't win in Texas without those.\" (Laughter.) Whatever happened to Beto? Oh, Beto. Come on back, Beto. (Laughter.) He was born to run for President. He got down to less than 1 percent. So many of those people are less than 1 percent. How can you be less than 1 percent? You got to be really bad. (Laughter.) The U.S. is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas in the entire world, by far. (Applause.) Never again will our country be at the mercy of hostile foreign suppliers. America has declared energy independence. I declared it. We're energy independent. (Applause.) Big thing. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. You ever notice in the straits , we always took care; we never got 10 cents for it , we'd keep those straits open. Nobody would dare mess around with all those countries that were making trillions and trillions and billions and billions. We kept those straits open. It was great, Jeffrey. It was beautiful what we did for these other countries. They never paid us 10 cents. We kept them open. We'd go and shoot at other ships and we'd fight this one and fight Iran. And I said, \"Do we ever get paid for anything?\" Right? But now they're saying , you know, when they were blowing up ships last year, they were saying, \"We'd love to get an American ship but they don't send too many of them.\" (Laughter.) We don't send too many of them over there. You know why? We have our own energy now. It's pretty good. It's gone way down. (Applause.) But you know who does get a lot of it , 60 percent? China. And I'd say, \"So let me ask you, why are we keeping the straits open for China?\" And others. But China gets a tremendous amount , percentagewise, tremendous , and we keep it open for them. I don't know. You had a lot of really nice people running our country over the years. Perhaps I'm not nice, but I'm doing a great job for you. (Applause.) True. Well, it's true. Yet every Democratic candidate wants to shut down American energy production , how do you do that? , including oil, natural gas, clean coal, and nuclear. They like wind. Wind. (Laughter.) I won't repeat it, but last year, the best line of the whole thing was wind, right? \"Darling, I'd like to watch television.\" \"I'm sorry, Alice, the wind is not blowing. You can't watch the debate.\" (Laughter.) That was the best line. I'm not going to go through it now because it'd be , I don't like to be repetitive , (applause) , like Sleepy Joe, where says the same thing four different times. (Laughter.) Oh, he's got a bad habit. \"Ladies and gentlemen of Ohio, it's great to be with you.\" \"Joe. Joe, you're an Iowa.\" (Laughter.) That was seven times he's done that. I haven't done it once. And if I did, you know what I'd do? I'd walk off the stage because there's nothing you can do to come back from that. (Laughter.) You can be , you can be Winston Churchill; he was a great, great speaker. Winston Churchill was pretty good, right? You could be Winston Churchill for the rest of the speech. And the press doesn't kill him. You know, he said the other night , this was really a beauty , Sleepy Joe; he said, \"Guns have killed 150 million people in our country.\" (Laughter.) And I'm watching. I said to your great First Lady , she's doing a great job , I said, \"First Lady \" (Applause.) Doing a great job. She's doing a great job. Very popular. She's very popular. Great style. Great style. Loves our country. Her father is here somewhere. Where is Viktor? Where is Viktor? Where is Viktor? Her father is here today. Where is Viktor? Her father is here someplace. He's someplace in this massive room. There he is. Hello, Viktor. (Applause.) Her father is a great guy. But I said to our great First Lady, \"First Lady \" I like calling her \"First Lady.\" (Laughter.) I love calling her , the First Lady , (laughter) , she said, \"It's okay. You can call me Melania.\" Good. (Laughter.) Now, see, when I have fun like that, you know what's going to happen tomorrow? It'll be a headline. \"He calls her First Lady.\" (Laughter.) Because they're dishonest people. We can have fun. Remember this thing, \"Russia, if you're listening\"? Remember, it was a big thing , in front of 25,000 people. \"Russia if you're \" It was all said in a joke. They cut it off right at the end so that you don't then see the laughter, the joke. And they said, \"He asked. He asked for help.\" Right? \"Russia, if you're listening \" A very famous , they cut that thing so quick at the end because they didn't want to hear the laughter in the place and me laughing. It was just \"boom.\" These are really dishonest people. But , but I said to her , it's true , I said to her, \"Let me ask you this: Did he just say that we killed 150 million people? That's half of our population. This is a terrible event.\" (Laughter.) \"We have to find out what's going on. This is bad.\" (Laughter.) This wasn't reported by the fake news. (Applause.) It's true. I said, \"I've got to check that, First Lady, because you know what? If 150 million people were killed last year by guns , and they didn't report the story. See, they didn't , they didn't report it. But you know what? Interestingly though , so I said \"Well, his debate is dead. It's dead. Nothing he can say.\" At the end, they said, \"His debate was great. He did a great job.\" If I would have said that, it would have been over. You know, it only takes one little phrase for me , like a little couple of words. If you mispronounce a word , you know with all I speak, they say, \"If he mispronounced the word \"the' , \"the.'\" He said \"tha.\" If you mispronounce \"the.\" (Laughter.) There's something going on. Something , Here's a guy who said they killed 150 million people with guns and nobody even talks about it. (Laughter.) But it is true; he's , a lot of times, he blows it with the , you know, you could , I don't do it. Fortunately, I don't need it yet. Hopefully, maybe someday I will. (Laughter.) But you know what you can do? You write down the name of the state that you're speaking. (Laughter.) And you put it up there, and whenever you're going to say the word, you look down. \"I'm in Florida today, folks. I'm in Maryland. I'm in Virginia. I'm in Iowa.\" (Laughter.) So they corrected him the one time he said \"Iowa.\" And then they said, \"No, no, Idaho.\" (Laughter.) And he said, \"I think , didn't I say that?\" No, he didn't say that. He thought they were the same. (Laughter.) No, he's going to have, I think, a pretty big win today, I think, based on the polls. I don't know how, the hell does he have a big win? Can you imagine? And I don't know, maybe we should do it. You know, I did a poll last night, right? Should I do that here? Am I allowed? Do you promise you're not going to charge me? You know, these pollsters , you know, they're the others ones. Like the Fox pollster is the worst of all. But I don't know, Fox is good but the pollster is so bad. Fox is good. You know, they're okay. (Laughter.) But , they're okay. They put certain people on , you know, they have a good show and then they put these people, the Never Trumpers, on at the end. There's nothing you can do to recover from that. But, you know, the pollsters are very phony, a lot of them. Some of it is worse than the actual journalists and reporters and stories. But last night, I did it in South Carolina. It was incredible. And we had, what would you say? Like Madison Square Garden almost. Right? It was , that thing was packed thousands and thousands of people. And we took a poll: Who would be my best person to run against? In other words, who would I like? Who would I do best against? Okay, to put it in very plain language, who the hell would I beat the easiest? Right? (Laughter.) And I took a poll. And I'll tell you the results but I'll , let's do it here, right? I mean, this group is , (applause) , okay. So, Pocahontas, we don't have to waste our time with, right? (Laughter.) Klobuchar, we don't have to waste it. Right? Let's leave , let's not waste a lot of time. (Laughter.) Okay? Butt-ig-ieg , (laughter) , I don't see it. To me, every time I look at that face, I see Alfred E. Neuman. It's true. (Laughter.) No, it's true. It's Alfred E. Alfred E. Neuman, Mad Magazine. See, the problem is most of you are too young. All these beautiful young women up here, they don't know what the hell I'm talking about. (Laughter.) But the old ones , the ones with the white hair , (applause) , they know exactly , they're laughing like hell. But it's true. (Laughter.) Somebody said use Howdy Doody because everyone knows , I said \"No, that's not , that's no good. It's got to be perfecto.\" (Laughter.) And Alfred E. Neuman is perfecto, but you're going to have to go back and get Mad Magazine, which I guess is out of business for a long time. (Laughter.) Like most other magazines, right? But it was one of those things where I didn't add his name. Then we went to Mini Mike. I said, \"I don't see it.\" Is , should we add his name? I don't see it. He's going to have to spend a hell of lot of money really fast, because he's getting killed in California. He's losing in Texas. He's losing all over the place. How the hell do you spend that much money and lose? You know, they had an article in, of all places, the New York Times. And it had the amount of personal money , not money you raised, personal money that somebody put up , and how they did. And they had , they started off with Mike Bloomberg, and I think he's like at $500 million. It was 500 , more than five hundred. This is personal money. He writes checks like a drunken sailor, if I can use that expression. (Laughter.) How much? Do you think those consultants , I know some of his people; they're bad people. They are ripping him off. (Laughter.) He's got a couple of people right at the top; they are ripping him off. They are laughing all the way to the bank. (Laughter.) \"Keep running, Mike. Mike, keep running. You're going to do it, Mike. Give us another three, four hundred million. I guarantee you the presidency, Mike.\" (Laughter.) Now he's looking, \"I promise you 500 million and I'm down at 10 percent. What the hell are you doing to me? Why did you make me do this?\" he says. No, but I know some of his people. They are ripping him off like you never believe. So I said, \"Should we put Mini Mike in there? I don't see it, right?\" No? Okay, I don't see Mini Mike. People got wise to him really fast. Didn't take too long. You know, you still have to , you can't buy. It showed something nice. I mean, assuming that happens, I don't think , you can't buy an election. You really can't buy, and that's a good thing not a bad thing. That's a good thing. (Applause.) And there are a lot of campaign finance violations there. There's no way you can do what he's doing. You know, you go into a town, you give somebody a contribution, two days later the guy comes, \"I'd like to support Mini Mike Bloomberg.\" There's something strange with that whole deal. So we have two names. We have , one is Crazy Bernie. He's crazy. And we have , he's like a crazy professor , and we have the other one is Sleepy Joe Biden, right? So let's take a poll, just , we'll go Biden first. Scream like hell if you think I should run against him. Right? Is that okay? In other words, because we're going to beat him. Who will we beat? So scream like hell. So, Sleepy Joe Biden. (Applause.) All right. This is, would you like me to run against him. Crazy Bernie Sanders. (Applause.) You can't charge me. You cannot charge me for that. Matt is going to send me a bill for that. (Laughter.) No, think of it. These pollsters , you ever see this crap? We interviewed 193 people , (laughter) , with a plus or minus 3. (Laughter.) You have thousands of people in here. I got it for free. But Mercedes will send me a bill , I guarantee you that , for a free poll. So, look, that happened last night too. I did the same thing. They think that Crazy Bernie , how could you be easier to beat than Joe? You know, that guy can put two sentences together. (Laughter.) It's insulting. How can you be easier? But, you know, he is more down the middle. You know, everyone knows he's not a communist, right? And with Bernie there's a real question about that, but he's definitely a radical-left socialist Democrat. And people know that. With Joe, he's sort of down the middle. You know, the difference is Joe is not going to be running the government, he's just going to be sitting in a home someplace , (laughter) , and people are going to be running it for him, and they will be radical-left socialists. So that's what you have to remember. He's , there's no way he's going to be running the government. But we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies, breaking up the unholy alliance of lobbyists, globalists, and special interests that bled our country, bled our factories, and bled our people dry. (Applause.) We understand that conservative policies must conserve our jobs, conserve our manufacturing, and conserve our American way of life. What we've done for manufacturing , look at all the manufacturing jobs; it's all coming back. Obama said, \"Never happened. Never happened. And it would never happen.\" And he said, \"You can keep your doctor.\" Why didn't they impeach him for saying that? (Laughter.) Remember 28 times, \"You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.\" It was a lie. Impeach him. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO. The worst two deals ever made in , now, I say , see, with all the women , humankind. I used to say \"mankind.\" Sounded sort of good. Now I say \"humankind.\" I don't use it that much. (Laughter.) Right? The women know what I'm talking about. The women get it better than the men. The women get it better. (Applause.) They named me TIME Magazine Person of the Year, right? Now, this year I lost to Greta. (Laughter.) Greta. I lost to Greta. I said, \"Who?\" (Laughter.) I'm not going to get involved in that, because last time I got in a little trouble. (Laughter.) But I lost to Greta. But it doesn't matter. I've won it, you know, enough. I mean, in all fairness, when the world evolves around this person , I don't say good, bad, or , but you turn on that stupid CNN, you turn on MSDNC , (laughter) , you turn on Fox, every story is Trump or Trump related, right? There's no , if a plane goes down with 700 people on it, they don't even cover it anymore. That used to be a big event. They don't cover it anymore. It's really unfair. But it's been , by the way, have we all had a great time, though? This journey. This journey, right? (Applause.) This journey has been amazing. You know, I tell the story , a month before I ran, I said to my wife, \"Well, I'm thinking about it.\" Said to a couple, \"Eh, I'm thinking about it.\" Didn't think too much about it. I thought about it like a day before I ran. (Laughter.) But I remember seeing the New York Times. It came to my office, I held it up, it was like a thing you hand out at a grocery store. You know, it would have blown away with a little wind , about two miles an hour, it would have blown away. That was the New York Times. Now it's a vibrant paper. But when I'm no longer here in 5 years or 9 years or 13 years or 17 years, 21, 25. (Applause.) No, they actually think I'm not leaving, you know. This crazy Bill Maher. Bill Maher, you ever hear of this guy? AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: He says, \"You know he's not leaving.\" He has a guest , some guest that didn't have a clue. And the guest , he said, \"You know Trump is going to win? You know that, don't you? He's going to win. You know he's going to win, don't you?\" That guy is devastated. Bill Maher. He's a nut job. \"You know he's going to win.\" And the guest says, \"No, no, we're going to fight very hard. We think we have a good chance.\" \"No, no, he's going to win. And then, you know what? He's never leaving, don't you? He's never leaving.\" (Laughter.) \"No, no, he's never leaving. No, no, he's got it work- , he will never leave. There is no way.\" And I used to think he was kidding. He's not. He is a total nut job, this guy. (Laughter.) But under my administration, the great betrayal of America is over. It is no longer for sale. (Applause.) Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe, and I signed the brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. A great job. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and workers all across our country. And, by the way, speaking of farmers, something they don't know but they're learning fast: No more estate tax on your small farm, small businesses, small other things. (Applause.) No more estate tax. People don't talk about it. It's a big thing , big provision. Big provision. If you love your children, it's great. If you don't love your children, it's irrelevant. Don't leave the money to them. (Laughter.) But, you know, in years gone by, great farmers , they have a good land, good everything , but they don't make that much cash. It's a tough business, right? And the banks would come in, loan money to the children, and the banks would end up owning the property and all hell was going on. It was terrible. No more estate tax or, as we call it, \"death tax.\" No more on small farms and small businesses. Right? (Applause.) Nobody talks about it. Nobody talks about that, but it's a big thing , if you love your children. If you don't , does anybody here not love your children? Raise your hand, please. (Laughter.) Look at that, not one hand. Well, that's conservative people. They all love their children, right? (Applause.) Oh, there's one hand in the back. I'm not calling him. (Laughter.) I also took the strongest-ever action to confront China's illicit trade practices. You see what happened there. (Applause.) And our strategy worked. And we have a great relationship with China now. We have a very good relationship. They didn't even respect us. They were taking out $500 billion a year. We had a trade imbalance. We had a deficit of more than $500 billion, with a \"B,\" dollars a year. Can you believe that? Who the hell can sustain , who wants to even talk about that? So we started charging tariffs. They hit our farmers. I gave the farmers everything that they took out, and the money came from China because it came out of the tariffs. And we had a lot of money left over. A long, complicated story, but not really complicated. No other President ever thought of it. And now the farmers love me, and we ended up making a great deal. (Applause.) But they loved me before. You know, the farmers, when they'd go to , CNN would go up, \"Is it terrible what President Trump is doing to you with trade war?\" He says, \"No. It's hurting me badly, but the trade war is necessary. And it should have been done years ago.\" Every one , I've never heard anybody say different. (Applause.) I've never heard anybody say different. The farmers are unbelievable. But I went to Sonny Perdue, our Secretary of Agriculture. I said, \"So let me ask you, Chinese is tough; they're smart. They hit them. How much did they take care out last year?\" \"Twelve billion dollars.\" \"How much did they take out this year?\" \"Sixteen billion dollars.\" That was last year. I said, \"$16 billion, $12 billion, good. We're going to give them back the $12 billion.\" Then we gave back the 16. Everything they took out. I said, \"What was the best year they ever had with China?\" It was $16 billion. I said, \"Good. I'll give them , I'll reimburse them the $16 billion out of the tariffs that China is paying.\" And, by the way, you know, China respects this, just so you understand. You know, other Presidents knew that they were getting ripped off. They didn't know what to do about it. They said, \"They'll attack our farmers. Our whole farmer , all the farmers will go bust.\" They didn't know. Charge them tariffs, pay them back, and then keep a hell of a lot more money than you're even giving to the farmers. And we kept tens of billions of dollars. (Applause.) And we made our first deal, and Schumer went, \"It's terrible, the deal. He got , he took the tariffs out.\" No, nobody wanted tariffs until I taught them what tariffs are. But \"It's terrible. He went and took the tariffs out.\" Actually, I didn't. They're paying 25 percent on $250 billion. I don't even know how we pulled off that one. (Laughter.) But they're paying , But China is great, and now they want to negotiate phase two, because they want to stop paying the 25 percent on $250 billion. Otherwise, we have no leverage, right? We have no leverage. (Applause.) But the farmers are the greatest. And even before they knew I was going to be able to reimburse them all that money that was being taken out of their pockets, they were , they said to me , I had 25 farmers in the White House, right in the Cabinet Room. I use the Cabinet Room. Everybody else used it only for the Cabinet. I use it for everything but the Cabinet. (Laughter.) No, I use it for farmers. We have beautiful , it's this incredible room. Right? This incredible room. And I said to the farmers , I said, \"You know, I want to give you back money. I want to give you a subsidy.\" \"Oh, we don't want the word \" , they didn't want , everybody else, they didn't care what I used. I could use \"subsidy.\" I could use \"welfare.\" I could use any word I wanted. The farmers hated the word \"subsidies.\" \"Sir we don't want anything. We just want a level playing field. It's been this way for 20 years. And it's been it's been absolutely hurting us.\" (Applause.) They didn't want anything. And I said, \"You know, are you serious?\" They said, \"Yeah, we just want a level playing field. Nobody can beat us.\" And it's true, nobody can beat. They want a level playing field. And I said to myself, \"Can you imagine, everybody that comes in , countries, other businesses, everybody , they want money. The farmers don't. They just wanted a level playing field.\" And that was at the bottom, when they really were looking , it was looking pretty bad. But now, China is going to be buying $50 billion worth of product. The most they ever , remember , got was 16, so they're buying 50. We agreed to 20. And in the final day, they were getting the agreements ready. I said, \"How much are the farmers getting?\" Meaning, how much is China going to purchase from our farmers? \"Twenty billion.\" I said, \"Do me a favor, make it 50.\" They said, \"50?\" I said, \"The farmers can't do that much, can they?\" They said, \"No.\" China said, \"Absolutely not.\" I said, \"Look, what does it mean? You got 1.5 billion people. What the hell difference between 20 billion and 50? It doesn't mean anything.\" They said, \"You're right. We'll give you 50.\" It's crazy. It's crazy. (Applause.) My only problem is I don't think the farmers can produce that much. It's going to be very good to be a farmer when that whole thing kicks in. We understand that our First Lady and highest , and you have to remember this: When our First Lady came out, she said to me today, \"Say hello to everybody.\" And she said that, \"Your first duty and your highest loyalty\" , and this was coming right from her , \"is to the American citizens. And you really have to let the people know.\" This is , Melania told me this. Can you believe this? (Applause.) She's like giving me a history lesson. Our First Lady is giving me a history , (applause) , Our highest loyalty to the American people. I said, \"Okay.\" That was pretty good. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'll tell her. I'll tell her that was the single-best line in the whole speech. (Laughter.) Nowhere has the American Left more thoroughly violated this sacrosanct principle than on immigration. Illegal immigration costs American taxpayers hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year, funds that could be used to improve our schools, roads, hospitals, and other vital services. Instead, Democrats want to take even more of your money to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free federal welfare, free education. They get treated better than they want to treat our military and our vets. And I stopped it. But it's crazy. The Democrat Party's immigration policies empower bloodthirsty cartels that maim, murder, and torture; that smuggle and traffic innocent human beings; that flood our communities with poisonous drugs. The Left's immigration policies are not compassionate; they are heartless, merciless, and cruel. Countless Americans are killed every year by criminal aliens. These are illegal aliens that come in, and they are, in many cases, very bad people. In Houston, Texas, an illegal alien was charged with the murder for killing a 75-year-old grandmother in her home, stabbing her with a vicious machete knife 13 times in the chest. In Georgia, an illegal alien was charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. Yet despite these travesties, the far-Left supports deadly sanctuary cities where people like that get protection. They release criminal alien predators into innocent communities rather than handing them over to our great heroes of ICE. (Applause.) ICE. They take such abuse. ICE , the toughest gangs in the world, MS-13. They slice people up. ICE takes them out by the thousands. (Applause.) Nobody else wants that job. The men over here don't want that job, I can tell you right now. They're tough and they love our country, but they got to be tough. Last year, California sanctuary law forced a single county to release over 1,000 convicted criminal aliens, and nearly 240 have already been arrested, and they're looking for others. And those are just the crimes that we know about. Montgomery County, Maryland, announced a sanctuary policy last July. Since then, at least 10 illegal immigrants have been arrested for sex crimes, including the rape of an 11-year-old girl. In Seattle, officials released a known MS-3 [sic] , think of this , this was a known MS-13 gang member who later beat a 16-year-old boy with a baseball bat and hacked him to death with a machete. The list goes on and on and on. And these people are protected by their sanctuary cities fools.In my State of the Union Address, I called at Congress to pass legislation allowing the victims of these deadly policies to sue these sanctuary cities for the pain, anguish, and suffering they inflict on our people. (Applause.) Everyone here today, and patriotic citizens all across our land, agree with a fundamental truth: Our country must be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. (Applause.) The Left's crazy mantra is: no borders, no nations, and no more deportations. They don't want to deport. Crazy Bernie said he'll never do a deportation. Right? Remember what he said? I better save this stuff. Maybe he won't get the nomination. I don't want to , I won't say that he said , he thinks the Boston bombers, right? , the Boston guys, right? , he said they have the right to vote. He said prisoners in prison have the right to vote. They said, \"Does that include the Boston maniac that's scheduled to die?\" Death penalty, which is very good. \"But does that include that?\" He said, \"Yes, he would get the right to vote.\" You believe that, that this guy would get the right to vote? So I said I won't use that until later on. And I used it today at CPAC, and now he'll find a way of getting out of it, and I won't be able to use it against him in the campaign. That's no god. (Laughter.) See what I do here, Matt? That's too bad. (Laughter.) Too early. I got to wait until about two months before the vote, right? Right? She's going, \"Yes, please wait.\" Except then you wouldn't have enjoyed that. But it's true. It's true. Yeah, it's okay for him to vote. It's fine. He can , he killed many people, badly maimed and wounded many people, and he's got the right to vote. Can you believe that this is where we've come? We believe in strong borders, sovereign nations, and the prompt deportation of anyone who illegally breaks into our country. (Applause.) And thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal crossings by a staggering 75 percent. (Applause.) We have ended catch and release, the worst of all the loopholes. (Applause.) We have seized a record amount of drugs and deported a record number of gang members. We are building the powerful border wall. We're already up to 128 miles of border wall. And you think that was easy? (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! THE PRESIDENT: It's being built. And it's being built to the highest standard you can build it. You know, just to show you again about the news: So we're building it, and part of it is desert, it's rough territory and very tough territory, in many ways. But the winds are blowing, and they're putting it up, and it's 30 feet high , steel and concrete both. And you have to be able to see through it. Very expensive. It's the ultimate wall in terms of , we went to Border Patrol. They did a study; they hired people, climbers. What's the hardest to climb? The piece on top. That's called an \"anti-climb provision.\" Supposedly, it makes it harder. Who knows? But I said, \"Do it.\" Another couple of bucks. (Laughter.) But we put up a wall, and it was blowing 50, 60 miles an hour in this territory. The concrete was just poured; it was soaking wet. The wall came down, and we end up with a big story. \"Trump's wall gets blown over by the wind.\" That's what it is. But I explained , because when you have Twitter, where you have so many millions of people, all you have to do is say: \"Scam.\" Scam. (Applause.) We can get the word out. Now we , we lifted it right back up and put it back,","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1404966\/remarks-by-president-trump-at-the-2020-conservative-political-action-conference-national-harbor-md&speechType=1","Summary":"National Security Executive Branch Health Insurance Energy Immigration Criminal Justice Elections","Source":null,"Location":"National Harbor, MD","Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-2020-conservative-political-action-conference-national-harbor-md\/","CleanText":"Well, I want to thank you, Matt.

Right? (Applause.) Been a long time. We had a great night yesterday in South Carolina. That was incredible. We filled up a stadium like you haven't seen. The stadium was packed and thousands of people outside. And I saw the competitors , our competitors. They'd have like two people on a street corner. (Laughter.) That's , it's incredible what's going on. This is a movement like , honestly, like nobody has ever seen before. We say that , we say that , (applause) , and, you know, if it wasn't so, the fake news media would be all over us, right? They'd say 'It wasn't so. He exaggerated.' I say it all the time. They never change it. You know, every once in a while, you see somebody who did well , let's say 'well' in New Hampshire or did well , not even win it , in Iowa, and the whole life of that person is made because we won the election. We did well in those places. Sit down, everybody, if you want. Sit down. (Laughter.) We won the election. (Applause.) So it's great. And I came here and I got to know Matt and Mercedes early on and I made a speech, before I thought about doing this. I said, 'Would you speak?' I was very famous then, too. (Laughter.) I guess more famous now. But I was very famous, and I made a speech and they liked the speech. They said, 'You ought to run for President.' I said, 'No thanks.' You remember that, Matt? 'You ought to run for President.' We had a big crowd. And it was , 'The Apprentice' was doing so well. It was like a hot, to put it mildly, show. (Laughter.) And Matt said, 'You ought to run for President.' I said, 'Let me give it a little thought.' (Laughter.) And a couple of years later, we said, 'Let's do it.' And then they said , (applause) , I never forget one of the people, respected guy, Charles Krauthammer. (Applause.) Right? He said on , well, this isn't so good, but he said on Fox , he said, 'No, why would he do this? You have 17 of the most talented professionals ever assembled that are running. Why would he run? He's not going to run, and if he does, he's only doing it for fun.' You think this has been fun? Does anybody , (laughter) , does anybody think , Mercedes, do think this has been fun? I don't think , you know. This has been just a ball. We've had a ball. (Laughter.) But you know what? You know what? We're doing so well and we're doing so much. No administration has ever done what we've done in the first three years. Nobody. (Applause.) With tax cuts and Supreme Court judges and 218 judges , roughly, 218 including D.C. But together, we're defeating the radical socialist Democrats, the fake news media, the crooked politicians, and the hate-filled left-wing mob. And I told you I was going to be nice today. See? (Laughter.) I said, 'Let's be nice today.' It's hard to be nice when they treat you so badly, right? Only a fool is nice when they treat you so badly. We're defending our faith, our values, our heritage, our borders, our rights, and our God-given freedoms. We're doing that. This is an incredible , look at all those people back there. This place has grown. Look. Wow. (Applause.) Wow. That's fantastic. I don't know who they are, Matt, but they must be very special, this little group over here. (Applause.) For Matt to block out half the arena for this group of people. (Laughter.) I'm trying to figure out, who are they? At first, I thought they were the fake news. I said, 'It's too bad they such a good location.' (Laughter.) I don't know who you are but you're very important. (Laughter.) It's true. Very important people. We're exposing the corruption of the Washington Democrats and we're draining the Washington swamp. (Applause.) I just didn't know how dirty it would be. I didn't know how deep it would be when I said, 'Drain the swamp.' For a long time , you know, I was given that expression. A speechwriter gave it to me. He said, 'Drain the swamp.' I said, 'That's so hokey.' (Laughter.) I said, 'That's the worst. I don't want to use it.' Anyway, it ends up in one of the speeches. I said, 'We will drain the swamp.' Right? The place went crazy. (Laughter.) I said, 'Let's try it again.' (Laughter.) And we did it again and the place went crazy. Now, here's the bad part, I never knew the swamp was so bad. It's really bad. But we're winning, and we're winning not easy, but we're winning. (Applause.) A lot of dirty people. A lot of very bad people. A lot of bad people. And I think , I think justice will be had. I do believe that, or I wouldn't be very happy right now. We got through everything. We've got through , they gave us the Mueller hoax. They gave us the Russia, Russia, Russia crap. They gave us the one phone call that was a perfect phone call. 'Oh, let's get him out of office for that phone call.' But, you know, the Republicans stuck together, except Romney of course. You know, Romney. Lowlife. Lowlife. Except Romney, they stuck together. And even him, I got half a vote, so, you know. (Laughter.) See, I say , I was thinking, because he did actually vote one (inaudible). He couldn't do it all, you know, because he wanted to get some nice free publicity for himself. But it was 52 and a half out of 53 votes. (Laughter.) True. I guess you can say that, right? Fifty two and a half, right? So think of it: The Republicans were fantas- , I tell you what. That's when you din out who your friends are, really. It is. And we had 52 and a half votes. And in the House we had 107 , think of it , 107 to nothing with the Republicans. 107 to nothing. And we got three Democrats. And one came over and left the Democrat Party: Van Drew. Jeff Van Drew. (Applause.) And really, together, we're preserving this exceptional nation that our ancestors fought and died to build. We are making America greater than ever before. We really are. I think it's going to be greater than ever before with what we're doing with our military and what we're doing also to get rid of very bad people. We have such bad people, and they're not , they're not people that love our country. We're getting people that really love our country, and it's so important. And if I wasn't able to fulfill that, no matter what other things we've done, I would not consider this journey to be a success. So just remember that. (Applause.) One of my most important promises to the American people was to end America's long-running wars in the Middle East. American forces , and we're all warriors, folks, but 19 years. I see the people; I go over and I say hello to those incredible soldiers over at Walter Reed. What talent you have at Walter Reed. Those doctors, by the way, they have to be the best in the world , what they can do. (Applause.) And I see the arms and the legs missing, and I see what's happened to some of these incredible, beautiful people, and I see the strength, the spirit , the spirit that they have. Most of them , I mean, even if they can't walk, if they've lost both legs, they want to go back. 'Sir, we want to go back. I want to go back.' And it's just incredible to see it. And I'm going to mention it a little bit later, but, you know, we knocked out Soleimani, the father of the roadside bomb. (Applause.) We killed him and al-Baghdadi. And al-Baghdadi. Soleimani was , Soleimani was the , they called him 'the father of the roadside bomb.' He thought it was great. 'Oh, the great bomb.' And, you know, he thought it was great. It kept getting bigger and more sophisticated. One young man, he said, 'My last day , it was my last day in Afghanistan.' And they had the mine detectors. And he said, 'I trusted this man with my life. He was the best. I've never seen anything like it. He could detect those. We felt so safe.' But, unfortunately, his last day, they made them out of plastic so you couldn't detect them, and it went off. Killed the man who was the detector, and badly, badly injured a lot of people, and he was one of them. And he said, 'Think of it, sir.' I said, 'Why did it go off?' He said, 'Because they made it out of plastic, and the plastic doesn't get detected by the metal detector.' And that was the last day, and he lost his legs. But we took that son of a bitch out, didn't we? (Applause.) It should have been done a long time ago. That should have been done a long time ago. That should have been done a long time ago. And al-Baghdadi, he's the father of ISIS, and we defeated ISIS in the Middle East. We have defeated 100 percent of the caliphate. (Applause.) But we said to the Europeans, 'Hey, take your soldiers.' We killed many, many terrorists. When I took over, by the way, it was a mess. There was so much. If they , I hate to say this, Republicans, but they had maps and it was all red. Red meant ISIS. I hate to say it. I said, 'Let's change the color.' I actually did change the color. (Laughter.) But they showed me maps and large portions of Iraq and Syria, ISIS. And we don't want them ever to come here. And I had some great people and have some incredible generals. And I had a decision to make, because that was just not , they were not doing it right. And we made the decision, and we took them out. Remember, I got to 98 percent and I said, 'All right, now I can bring our people home.' 'Sir ' And then what happened is the press; they didn't care. But they went crazy. 'He didn't complete the job.' I was at 98 percent, Matt. They said, 'He didn't complete the job.' I said, 'General, complete the job.' And they completed the job. (Applause.) But the Europeans should be helping us, because many of those people that we're guarding now , thousands and thousands of ISIS fighters and others , and many of those people will go home to France and Germany and UK and others. And we say, 'Take them.' 'No, no, no, we don't want to them.' See, this is it , we do things for other people and then they forget, our allies. Sometimes our allies treat us worse than our enemies. I hate to say this to you, but sometimes they do. It's very sad. Did them a big favor, but that's all right. It's all working out very well. But we took out al-Baghdadi, who everybody was after. That was , you'd see him all the time speaking with a fan. That was an old picture , he was young. He got older. But they were looking for him for 16 years. And one of the first things I said when I came in is, 'You got to find this guy, al-Baghdadi.' 'Yes, sir.' All of a sudden, they walk in, they said, 'We have him, sir. We're following him all over the Middle East.' He'd move from place to place to place. 'We're following him, sir.' And then they said, 'Sir, we have him.' And I had to give an order and I gave an order. And I'll tell you what: Sixty-six of the most incredible soldiers you've ever seen. They went in on eight helicopters. And, you know, in modern-day warfare, you can watch. I mean, I'm watching it. I'm watching it from the Situation Room. You believe it? It was like , you can't make a movie like this. (Laughter.) For instance, there's no dog like Conan. No dog. (Applause.) There's no dog like Conan, right? In fact, Conan, after the operation, was a tremendous success. I mean, they were looking for him for a long time. And it was a lot of violent fighting, and then ultimately we got him. He was in a tunnel, at the end of the tunnel. And Conan was going after him. Conan almost was electrocuted. You know that story. But the guys went after him, and we got him. But you wouldn't believe how great it felt. And when you saw the professionalism that of these soldiers, I can't even tell you. There's , nobody has a military like we have. There's nobody with the talent that we have. It's incredible. (Applause.) They got him, and he knew it. He knew it. He knew it. As soon as he heard that first little explosion , that took them about three seconds , that blew the hell out of the wall. I said, 'Why don't they go through the front door?' He said, 'Sir, you go through the front door, you got a lot of bullets coming at you.' They went through a solid concrete wall. They put stuff up, boom. So fast. (Laughter.) So now they're shooting the other guys from behind. That's much better, right? (Laughter.) Guys are saying, 'Who's that? Who's that?' (Laughter and applause.) Guys were unbelievable. You don't have a movie like that. And Conan actually , Conan was given more press than your President , I'm telling you. (Laughter.) It was like about a half-a-day story. If somebody else would have done it, it would have been the greatest thing to ever happen. But that's all right. I do it for a different reason. I do it because we have to, to keep ourselves safe. I do it also for all of the people that they killed and wounded. Right? (Applause.) They killed and wounded a lot of people. But American forces cannot be the policemen for the entire world. We're all over the world. And a lot of times, we're not even appreciated. It's taken for granted. We can't be the policemen for the world and the democracy builders. We just can't do that for every nation that seems to have difficulty, especially for those nations that don't appreciate what we do , and there are many of them. Many of them. And that goes with trade also. We've changed the whole thing around. Their job is to be secure, and my job is to make sure that we're secure and to defend our country first. Our country. Today, the United States , (applause) , for years, they've been trying to do this, and today the United States signed a deal with the Taliban so that we can hopefully begin the immediate process of finally bringing our troops back home. (Applause.) Nineteen years. Nineteen years where they're , thank you. And as you know, others wanted to do it. We got it done and just signed it. And I want to thank a lot of people. We really have to thank , you know who we have to thank? The families and those incredible people that lost their lives, to start off with, okay? (Applause.) Those incredible families , I've gotten to know so many families. And we have to thank our wounded warriors that came home missing limbs and serious, serious things. Our great wounded warriors. We're taking good care of them, too. (Applause.) And I want to just thank our military because, you know, we've been, really, a police force there for the last long time. And we're not supposed to be a police force. We're supposed to be fighting soldiers. And we could win that war very easily if we wanted to lose , kill a million people that have nothing to do with it, that don't know anything about us. And it's really a great feeling. I saw it. I watched the ceremony today, early in the morning, on our television. And Mike Pompeo, Secretary. State. (Applause.) Secretary of Defense Esper is doing a great job. So Pompeo and Esper were actually in different locations signing with different groups. And pretty complicated deal, I have to be honest. But in exchange for the Taliban's action against al Qaeda and other terrorists who could threaten us, we're prepared to begin those force withdrawals. And if the Taliban and the Afghan government live up to their commitments , and they may or they may not, but I think we have a lot of reason why they will. I think they will. That means that the longest war in American history, by far , it's not even close , will be over. (Applause.) And again, the agreement was made possible by the extraordinary bravery of our , of our American warriors. The sacrifice of these incredible people and their allies. And I want to also thank , I will say this: NATO came in and Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO. You know, we had 28 , essentially 28 , countries participating in this, and they're very happy to be out. They're very happy to be , soon to be doing other things. And I'll say this for the Taliban: They're great fighters. You know that. Obviously, they're great fighters. All you have to do is ask the Soviet Union, 'Are they great fighters?' (Laughter.) 'They are great fighters.' But they , they're tired also. They , this is 19 years. Nineteen years. So, I'm very happy to announce that this group in particular , it's just, sort of , I should say we scheduled it for our CPAC day. (Laughter.) You know? We scheduled it for CPAC, because what better place? (Applause.) But we salute those who gave their lives, and we salute all of those incredible people. And after years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own American citizens. (Applause.) It's time, right? It's time. You remember recently when I took the soldiers out of Syria, and everyone said, 'Well we have to protect the border between Turkey and Syria.' I said, 'Why? Why? What does it have to do with us? They've been fighting for 1,000 years. What does it have to do with us? Why are we protecting the border?' 'You can't do that.' I did it. (Laughter.) We created a safe zone. And I did leave a number of soldiers because we kept the oil. There's oil there, and we kept the oil, if it's okay. So they say, 'He left soldiers there.' No, no, I left soldiers to keep the oil, okay? (Laughter.) They don't want to say that. They like to say, 'He kept soldiers there. He , he didn't tell the truth.' These people are the worst. (Laughter.) They are the worst. It would be so much easier for our country if we had a press that told the truth. It would be so much easier. (Applause.) True. Right? It's true. And we're also committed to ensuring that those who mean to do us harm as a nation, even as individuals, are denied admission to America. They're not allowed into our country. And we have some very, very powerful people. Right now our borders are strong. All of the 9\/11 hijackers came here on visas, and we're determined to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. (Applause.) Right? And we're keeping them out. Border security is also health security. In our efforts to keep America safe, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to control our borders and protect Americans from the coronavirus. (Applause.) Came from China. In the early stages of the foreign outbreak, I ordered sweeping travel restrictions to prevent uncontrolled spread of this disease. I took a lot of heat, because I did it very early. You know, we had never done it before, Matt. Never done it before. And we had never done anything like that before. So not only did we do it, but I did it very early. And that decision has been now given very good grades, like an A-plus- plus-plus. (Applause.) I took a lot of heat, even from my own people. But we did the right thing. The extreme fringes called us 'racists' for imposing these critical lifesaving measures. They wanted to let infected people pour into our country. I don't think they knew how bad it was, in all fairness, but nothing will deter us from protecting the wellbeing of the American people. (Applause.) My job is to protect Americans and also, very crucially, in this case, to protect Americans' health. And we'll do that. And we will do it with the vigor. That is why, today, my admin- , (applause) , right, thank you. That is why, today, my administration announced new measures to protect Americans to the fullest extent possible. In addition to the existing ban on travel by most Iranian nationals, we're banning the travel of anyone who has been to Iran in the last 14 days. They're having a very big outbreak. (Applause.) And I say here and now, if we can help the Iranians , we're doing certain things for them now , and if we can help the Iranians , we have the greatest healthcare professionals in the world , and if we can help the Iranians with this problem, we are certainly willing to do so. We would love to be able to help them. And all they have to do is ask. We will have great professionals over there. We have the best in the world. (Applause.) And we're raising the State Department travel advisories for South Korea and Italy, unfortunately, including a level four , that's the highest: 'Do not travel.' It's a 'do not travel' advisory for several areas of both countries. There are two areas of each country that is very heavily infected. And we are urging Americans to exercise increased caution throughout all of Europe. We will do everything in our power to keep the virus, and those carrying the infections, from entering our country. As you know, we took in approximately 40 people; they were Americans. And they may have had it. Some had it, but they will put in quarantine, and it's working out. Many of them are in good shape right now, and they're better and going home. It's time for all Americans to put politics aside and to come together to work for the health, safety, and security of the American people. They're great people. (Applause.) Because, you know, I watch , and maybe it's a natural reflex , but I watch , because we have done a great job. I mean, if nothing else, making that very early decision weeks , weeks early. And we've done a great job. And I've gotten to know these professionals. They're incredible. And everything is under control. I mean, they're very, very cool. They've done it, and they've done it well. Everything is really under control. But when they put a mic in front of a Democrat, and the Democrat said , doesn't even know what's going on. 'How is Trump doing?' 'He's doing a terrible job.' Well, sadly, I'd probably say the same about them. (Laughter.) You know? (Applause.) I guess it's a natural reflex. 'How is Donald Trump doing, Nervous Nancy?' (Laughter.) 'He's doing a terrible job. It's terrible.' Cryin' Chuck Schumer, I mean, he goes , he sees a mic, he'll run 200 yards to get to a mic. (Laughter.) He always did. In New York, same thing. He'd run hundreds of yards to find a mic. And then he'd start screaming, 'He's doing a terrible job.' What job? 'I don't know. What's he working on now?' (Laughter.) No, we have to be able to do , this is a different kind of a deal. I mean, you know, it's , we've made great deals. We've made great trade deals. Great everything. But this is different. We've got to be very careful with this stuff. And if we're doing a good job , and it's really the professionals , they have to be given a lot of credit for it because a lot of people wouldn't be able to do it. So we have to make it nonpartisan if we can. (Applause.) In just three short years under my administration, we've already achieved unprecedented victories and unrivaled gains for our citizens. As I said in my State of the Union Address, we are in the midst of a 'great American comeback.' That's what is happening. (Applause.) Our economy is roaring, jobs are booming, opportunity is soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, and America is stronger today than ever before. Stronger today. (Applause.) Our military is incredible. We have rebuilt our incredible U.S. military, revived our industrial might, and restored our standing in the world. America is respected again, respected like never before. (Applause.) Since my election, America has gained 7 million new jobs, 5 million more than government experts projected at the end of the last administration. They were saying the most you could possibly do is 2 million; we did 7 million. (Applause.) I never even said we were going to do 7 million. That's a lot of jobs. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over 51 years. The average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any President in the history of the United States. (Applause.) That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows , all record lows. Every one, lowest ever. (Applause.) Young people have seen their wages increased by 16 percent. A record. And their wages are rising three times faster than those wages. During the last four years of , did you ever hear of this gentleman? , the Obama administration. You ever hear of him? More than 2 million millennials have gotten jobs. We have lifted 10 million people off the welfare rolls and 7 million people off of food stamps. (Applause.) And under the so-called Trump economy, we are actually achieving the progress, hope, and change that liberals have been falsely promising for decades but utterly failed to deliver or produce. And it's really driving them crazy. (Laughter and applause.) That's why we'll probably end up with Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie. He's crazy. We got some beauties. We got Sleepy Joe. We got Crazy Bernie. We got Mini Mike, but I think he's out of it. (Laughter.) I would like to spend $700 million and end up with nothing. (Laughter.) Mini Mike. I know him well. I knew that was going to happen. That was probably the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates. Do we agree? Has there ever been anything like , (applause) , but he's going to keep spending the money. I think, this weekend, he's going to , I hear his ads stop on Tuesday. He's going for Tuesday. He's going to spend a lot of money. It just shows you that you can't buy an election. I mean, it just , there's a point in which people say, 'You got to bring the goods a little bit, too. You got to bring the goods.' Boy, did Pocahontas destroy him. I'll tell you. (Laughter.) And look what I did to her. (Laughter.) She choked. You know, she went out and got a test because I was killing her with the Pocahontas. (Laughter.) Remember, I said, 'I have more Indiana blood in me than she does and I have none'? (Laughter.) Right? I said it. I said it. (Applause.) Would love to have some but I have none. And she was getting hit with that name, 'Pocahontas.' That was one of the good ones. (Laughter.) And they said, 'We want you to apologize for that name.' And I did. I apologized. Nobody ever heard me apologize before. (Laughter.) I apologized to the real Pocahontas. I apologized. (Laughter.) But she went out and she said, 'Oh, this guy is killing me.' Remember, she was dropping like a rock. (Laughter.) But I learned something: Never do it too early. Two , a year and a half before the election, I said, 'What am I doing? I should have saved it.' But that's all right. Because she had those burning embers and then she started, but ultimately she failed. She's gone soon. But she was really mean to Mini Mike. I'll tell you, the way she treated him. He didn't know what hit him. (Laughter.) He's going, 'Oh, get me off of this stage.' (Laughter.) 'Get me off! Get me off of this stage!' (Laughter and applause.) It's true. It's true. Well, thank you very much. We hit a nerve there, right? (Laughter.) Bad guy. Far-left radicals have become increasingly desperate and increasingly dangerous in their quest to transform America into a country you would not recognize, a country in which they control every aspect of American life. Just as socialist and communist movements have done all over the world, they're cracking down on all dissent and demanding absolute conformity. They want total control. They want to massively raise your taxes, bury you in regulations, take over American healthcare, indoctrinate our children from kindergarten to college , and you see that happening. Kids are coming home saying, 'What's going on here, dad?' The kids get it. But eventually, they can be taught, unfortunately. Impose a fanatical code of political correctness, bombard our citizens with fake-news propaganda, and implement policies that would turn America, very quickly, into a large-scale Venezuela. They want to take away your money, take away your choice, take away your speech, take away your guns, take away your religion, take away your history, take away your future, and take away, ultimately, your freedom. But we will never let them do that. (Applause.) For many years, the radical left's sustained assault on American democracy, culture, institutions, and values went unanswered, but now we are fighting back, and we are winning like never before. We're here. We are winning. You know? There was a time I used to come to CPAC; it didn't have this kind of energy. Number one, you didn't have the President. (Laughter.) You know, I was only going to do this for Matt once. (Laughter.) I said, 'Look, I'm President. I can't go to CPAC.' Right, Matt? I said, 'I can't do it.' So I did it. We had a great time. Next day he calls, 'Can you do it again next year?' I said, 'Yeah, I guess. (Laughter and applause.) This is like my fourth time or something, right? Or more. Or more. And I'll be here next year. Okay? (Applause.) Huh? Why not? Thank you. From the moment I took the Oath of Office, the left has pursued a relentless crusade to overturn the results of the 2016 election and sabotage our next election. You know that. It was all a big hoax. You know that. Disgraceful. We caught the dirty cop on top. Had I not fired Comey, it would have been a whole different story. Would have been a whole different story. (Applause.) That was a great firing. I'll tell you, a lot of people said, 'Oh you shouldn't have done that.' No, no, no, just the opposite. We didn't fire him. Remember the insurance policy? Right? Right? Remember that? My friend over there , you are the greatest. Thank you very much stand up please. Look at him. Look at , does everybody know Jeffrey? Jeffrey Lord. What a great guy. (Applause.) He used to defend me on CNN, and then he defended me just a little bit too much. And they said, 'Jeffrey, get the hell out.' And thank goodness you're on Fox now. Right? (Applause.) He used to defend me. He used to say, 'He's better than Ronald Reagan.' And that was enough for Jeffrey. That was the end. They were , 'Get out of here, Jeffrey.' (Laughter.) 'We don't want you anymore.' He was too good. Thank you. Thank you for being here too, Jeffrey. They're coming after me, and we fight them back. And now we're going after them because we have no choice. We have to straighten out our country. (Applause.) But despite the best efforts of the left-wing fanatics, their scams, schemes, slanders , they've all been discredited. Totally discredited. How's Comey doing? How is , by the way, how is Bob Mueller doing? That was a great performance in Congress. (Laughter.) 'Raise your right hand.' 'What?' (Laughter.) 'Did you want a job in the White House running the FBI?' 'Uh, no.' Oh, he did. He did. He did. What happened to him? That was a lie. That was a lie. We have it down. He said, 'No, no.' It was a lie. He wanted a job. He wanted to be Director of the FBI. And then they appointed him the following day into special counsel. I call it 'special prosecutor' because special prosecutor is a much more accurate name. What they did to us , what they tried to do , and yet, can you imagine with all of that , going through all of that with a cloud over your head like nobody has ever had, for us to have seriously done more than any other administration? I mean, it's sort of a miracle when you think. (Applause.) Sort of a miracle or it's a toughness, or it's something. (Applause.) Maybe it's right there, right? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, God. (Applause.) How did we do that? How did we do it? Best economy, greatest military, greatest tax cuts in history, greatest regulation cuts in history. All those judges , those as beautiful judges. (Applause.) Two Supreme Court judges. (Applause.) Great ones. But their sinister plots have been exposed and their credibility has been totally destroyed. They're still just dealing with the embers, you know? A little bit like Pocahontas. She had those embers. And she started coming up, and that was the end. But they have embers too. They have embers. They have a lot of bad people around. But one by one. With the help of everyone here today, the American Dream is back bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. It's true. (Applause.) It's true. To lift up forgotten and impoverished communities, we created nearly 9,000 Opportunities Zones all across our country , Tim Scott , Senator Tim Scott was so great , (applause) , creating jobs, opportunity, and investment. It's now pouring into the places that needed it the most. We have poor areas that haven't had 10 cents invested in them in years and years and years. And now millions of dollars are going in there. We're transforming neighborhoods. It's incredible. It's incredible. (Applause.) It's one of the , it's not talked about much by the media. It's one of the greatest things ever done in terms of economic development: Opportunities Zones. Millions and millions of dollars are being poured and not being poured in by the federal government. Not being poured in by the federal government. It's an incredible thing. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history, larger than any before. And it's incredible. You know, all my life , I've only been doing this for five years, okay? , but all my life, I've watched politics. And it was always the guy that cut taxes , you want to cut taxes. The Democrats have a strange platform: They don't want a wall; they want people to pour in. They want to raise your taxes, right? They say, 'We want to raise taxes.' I'm trying to say, 'Is this like a good thing to campaign on?' (Laughter.) They want to raise taxes. Right? Think of it: They want to have sanctuary cities where you protect bad people, in many cases. The sanctuary cities. And, by the way, we just want the big case. Did you see that? (Applause.) Whoa. Two days ago. If they have a sanctuary city and they don't do what we need for law enforcement, we don't have to pay them any of that money. That's billions and billions and billions. (Applause.) Wow. Where did that come from? Where did that come from? And 40 million American families are enjoying an average of $2,200 more in their pocket thanks to a beautiful thing that Republicans really don't know about too much. You know, the Democrats like to take credit. It's called 'child tax credit.' We took that. That was Ivanka Trump , right, Mercedes? Ivanka Trump. She wanted that so badly. (Applause.) We've cut a record number of job-killing regulations because regulation is stealth taxation, especially on the poor. We have cut more regulations in this administration in three years than any administration has cut in four years, in eight years, or in one case, longer than that. You know, who that was: good, old FDR. We've ended the war on American energy. American energy was under siege. And I'll tell you what: We don't want to talk negatively, but if for any reason any of these characters get in there, you can forget , I mean, I don't know how you're going to win Texas, by the way. I don't know how you're going to win Pennsylvania, by the way. (Applause.) I don't. They want to , they don't want petroleum products. Other than that, they're wonderful, right? How about this great character, Beto, right? Beto. Everyone thought , remember he said, 'I was born to run. I was born.' He was born. Guy was a disaster. He said, 'I was born.' Anybody that says he was 'born to run' , he was born to do what I'm doing. Anybody that , I don't even say it and I won one. (Laughter.) It's true. No, it's so presumptuous. 'I was born to run for President.' Well, then he came out against guns, religion, and oil, and he comes from Texas. And I said, 'Abraham Lincoln couldn't win in Texas without those.' (Laughter.) Whatever happened to Beto? Oh, Beto. Come on back, Beto. (Laughter.) He was born to run for President. He got down to less than 1 percent. So many of those people are less than 1 percent. How can you be less than 1 percent? You got to be really bad. (Laughter.) The U.S. is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas in the entire world, by far. (Applause.) Never again will our country be at the mercy of hostile foreign suppliers. America has declared energy independence. I declared it. We're energy independent. (Applause.) Big thing. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. You ever notice in the straits , we always took care; we never got 10 cents for it , we'd keep those straits open. Nobody would dare mess around with all those countries that were making trillions and trillions and billions and billions. We kept those straits open. It was great, Jeffrey. It was beautiful what we did for these other countries. They never paid us 10 cents. We kept them open. We'd go and shoot at other ships and we'd fight this one and fight Iran. And I said, 'Do we ever get paid for anything?' Right? But now they're saying , you know, when they were blowing up ships last year, they were saying, 'We'd love to get an American ship but they don't send too many of them.' (Laughter.) We don't send too many of them over there. You know why? We have our own energy now. It's pretty good. It's gone way down. (Applause.) But you know who does get a lot of it , 60 percent? China. And I'd say, 'So let me ask you, why are we keeping the straits open for China?' And others. But China gets a tremendous amount , percentagewise, tremendous , and we keep it open for them. I don't know. You had a lot of really nice people running our country over the years. Perhaps I'm not nice, but I'm doing a great job for you. (Applause.) True. Well, it's true. Yet every Democratic candidate wants to shut down American energy production , how do you do that? , including oil, natural gas, clean coal, and nuclear. They like wind. Wind. (Laughter.) I won't repeat it, but last year, the best line of the whole thing was wind, right? 'Darling, I'd like to watch television.' 'I'm sorry, Alice, the wind is not blowing. You can't watch the debate.' (Laughter.) That was the best line. I'm not going to go through it now because it'd be , I don't like to be repetitive , (applause) , like Sleepy Joe, where says the same thing four different times. (Laughter.) Oh, he's got a bad habit. 'Ladies and gentlemen of Ohio, it's great to be with you.' 'Joe. Joe, you're an Iowa.' (Laughter.) That was seven times he's done that. I haven't done it once. And if I did, you know what I'd do? I'd walk off the stage because there's nothing you can do to come back from that. (Laughter.) You can be , you can be Winston Churchill; he was a great, great speaker. Winston Churchill was pretty good, right? You could be Winston Churchill for the rest of the speech. And the press doesn't kill him. You know, he said the other night , this was really a beauty , Sleepy Joe; he said, 'Guns have killed 150 million people in our country.' (Laughter.) And I'm watching. I said to your great First Lady , she's doing a great job , I said, 'First Lady ' (Applause.) Doing a great job. She's doing a great job. Very popular. She's very popular. Great style. Great style. Loves our country. Her father is here somewhere. Where is Viktor? Where is Viktor? Where is Viktor? Her father is here today. Where is Viktor? Her father is here someplace. He's someplace in this massive room. There he is. Hello, Viktor. (Applause.) Her father is a great guy. But I said to our great First Lady, 'First Lady ' I like calling her 'First Lady.' (Laughter.) I love calling her , the First Lady , (laughter) , she said, 'It's okay. You can call me Melania.' Good. (Laughter.) Now, see, when I have fun like that, you know what's going to happen tomorrow? It'll be a headline. 'He calls her First Lady.' (Laughter.) Because they're dishonest people. We can have fun. Remember this thing, 'Russia, if you're listening'? Remember, it was a big thing , in front of 25,000 people. 'Russia if you're ' It was all said in a joke. They cut it off right at the end so that you don't then see the laughter, the joke. And they said, 'He asked. He asked for help.' Right? 'Russia, if you're listening ' A very famous , they cut that thing so quick at the end because they didn't want to hear the laughter in the place and me laughing. It was just 'boom.' These are really dishonest people. But , but I said to her , it's true , I said to her, 'Let me ask you this: Did he just say that we killed 150 million people? That's half of our population. This is a terrible event.' (Laughter.) 'We have to find out what's going on. This is bad.' (Laughter.) This wasn't reported by the fake news. (Applause.) It's true. I said, 'I've got to check that, First Lady, because you know what? If 150 million people were killed last year by guns , and they didn't report the story. See, they didn't , they didn't report it. But you know what? Interestingly though , so I said 'Well, his debate is dead. It's dead. Nothing he can say.' At the end, they said, 'His debate was great. He did a great job.' If I would have said that, it would have been over. You know, it only takes one little phrase for me , like a little couple of words. If you mispronounce a word , you know with all I speak, they say, 'If he mispronounced the word 'the' , 'the.' He said 'tha.' If you mispronounce 'the.' (Laughter.) There's something going on. Something , Here's a guy who said they killed 150 million people with guns and nobody even talks about it. (Laughter.) But it is true; he's , a lot of times, he blows it with the , you know, you could , I don't do it. Fortunately, I don't need it yet. Hopefully, maybe someday I will. (Laughter.) But you know what you can do? You write down the name of the state that you're speaking. (Laughter.) And you put it up there, and whenever you're going to say the word, you look down. 'I'm in Florida today, folks. I'm in Maryland. I'm in Virginia. I'm in Iowa.' (Laughter.) So they corrected him the one time he said 'Iowa.' And then they said, 'No, no, Idaho.' (Laughter.) And he said, 'I think , didn't I say that?' No, he didn't say that. He thought they were the same. (Laughter.) No, he's going to have, I think, a pretty big win today, I think, based on the polls. I don't know how, the hell does he have a big win? Can you imagine? And I don't know, maybe we should do it. You know, I did a poll last night, right? Should I do that here? Am I allowed? Do you promise you're not going to charge me? You know, these pollsters , you know, they're the others ones. Like the Fox pollster is the worst of all. But I don't know, Fox is good but the pollster is so bad. Fox is good. You know, they're okay. (Laughter.) But , they're okay. They put certain people on , you know, they have a good show and then they put these people, the Never Trumpers, on at the end. There's nothing you can do to recover from that. But, you know, the pollsters are very phony, a lot of them. Some of it is worse than the actual journalists and reporters and stories. But last night, I did it in South Carolina. It was incredible. And we had, what would you say? Like Madison Square Garden almost. Right? It was , that thing was packed thousands and thousands of people. And we took a poll: Who would be my best person to run against? In other words, who would I like? Who would I do best against? Okay, to put it in very plain language, who the hell would I beat the easiest? Right? (Laughter.) And I took a poll. And I'll tell you the results but I'll , let's do it here, right? I mean, this group is , (applause) , okay. So, Pocahontas, we don't have to waste our time with, right? (Laughter.) Klobuchar, we don't have to waste it. Right? Let's leave , let's not waste a lot of time. (Laughter.) Okay? Butt-ig-ieg , (laughter) , I don't see it. To me, every time I look at that face, I see Alfred E. Neuman. It's true. (Laughter.) No, it's true. It's Alfred E. Alfred E. Neuman, Mad Magazine. See, the problem is most of you are too young. All these beautiful young women up here, they don't know what the hell I'm talking about. (Laughter.) But the old ones , the ones with the white hair , (applause) , they know exactly , they're laughing like hell. But it's true. (Laughter.) Somebody said use Howdy Doody because everyone knows , I said 'No, that's not , that's no good. It's got to be perfecto.' (Laughter.) And Alfred E. Neuman is perfecto, but you're going to have to go back and get Mad Magazine, which I guess is out of business for a long time. (Laughter.) Like most other magazines, right? But it was one of those things where I didn't add his name. Then we went to Mini Mike. I said, 'I don't see it.' Is , should we add his name? I don't see it. He's going to have to spend a hell of lot of money really fast, because he's getting killed in California. He's losing in Texas. He's losing all over the place. How the hell do you spend that much money and lose? You know, they had an article in, of all places, the New York Times. And it had the amount of personal money , not money you raised, personal money that somebody put up , and how they did. And they had , they started off with Mike Bloomberg, and I think he's like at $500 million. It was 500 , more than five hundred. This is personal money. He writes checks like a drunken sailor, if I can use that expression. (Laughter.) How much? Do you think those consultants , I know some of his people; they're bad people. They are ripping him off. (Laughter.) He's got a couple of people right at the top; they are ripping him off. They are laughing all the way to the bank. (Laughter.) 'Keep running, Mike. Mike, keep running. You're going to do it, Mike. Give us another three, four hundred million. I guarantee you the presidency, Mike.' (Laughter.) Now he's looking, 'I promise you 500 million and I'm down at 10 percent. What the hell are you doing to me? Why did you make me do this?' he says. No, but I know some of his people. They are ripping him off like you never believe. So I said, 'Should we put Mini Mike in there? I don't see it, right?' No? Okay, I don't see Mini Mike. People got wise to him really fast. Didn't take too long. You know, you still have to , you can't buy. It showed something nice. I mean, assuming that happens, I don't think , you can't buy an election. You really can't buy, and that's a good thing not a bad thing. That's a good thing. (Applause.) And there are a lot of campaign finance violations there. There's no way you can do what he's doing. You know, you go into a town, you give somebody a contribution, two days later the guy comes, 'I'd like to support Mini Mike Bloomberg.' There's something strange with that whole deal. So we have two names. We have , one is Crazy Bernie. He's crazy. And we have , he's like a crazy professor , and we have the other one is Sleepy Joe Biden, right? So let's take a poll, just , we'll go Biden first. Scream like hell if you think I should run against him. Right? Is that okay? In other words, because we're going to beat him. Who will we beat? So scream like hell. So, Sleepy Joe Biden. (Applause.) All right. This is, would you like me to run against him. Crazy Bernie Sanders. (Applause.) You can't charge me. You cannot charge me for that. Matt is going to send me a bill for that. (Laughter.) No, think of it. These pollsters , you ever see this crap? We interviewed 193 people , (laughter) , with a plus or minus 3. (Laughter.) You have thousands of people in here. I got it for free. But Mercedes will send me a bill , I guarantee you that , for a free poll. So, look, that happened last night too. I did the same thing. They think that Crazy Bernie , how could you be easier to beat than Joe? You know, that guy can put two sentences together. (Laughter.) It's insulting. How can you be easier? But, you know, he is more down the middle. You know, everyone knows he's not a communist, right? And with Bernie there's a real question about that, but he's definitely a radical-left socialist Democrat. And people know that. With Joe, he's sort of down the middle. You know, the difference is Joe is not going to be running the government, he's just going to be sitting in a home someplace , (laughter) , and people are going to be running it for him, and they will be radical-left socialists. So that's what you have to remember. He's , there's no way he's going to be running the government. But we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies, breaking up the unholy alliance of lobbyists, globalists, and special interests that bled our country, bled our factories, and bled our people dry. (Applause.) We understand that conservative policies must conserve our jobs, conserve our manufacturing, and conserve our American way of life. What we've done for manufacturing , look at all the manufacturing jobs; it's all coming back. Obama said, 'Never happened. Never happened. And it would never happen.' And he said, 'You can keep your doctor.' Why didn't they impeach him for saying that? (Laughter.) Remember 28 times, 'You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.' It was a lie. Impeach him. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO. The worst two deals ever made in , now, I say , see, with all the women , humankind. I used to say 'mankind.' Sounded sort of good. Now I say 'humankind.' I don't use it that much. (Laughter.) Right? The women know what I'm talking about. The women get it better than the men. The women get it better. (Applause.) They named me TIME Magazine Person of the Year, right? Now, this year I lost to Greta. (Laughter.) Greta. I lost to Greta. I said, 'Who?' (Laughter.) I'm not going to get involved in that, because last time I got in a little trouble. (Laughter.) But I lost to Greta. But it doesn't matter. I've won it, you know, enough. I mean, in all fairness, when the world evolves around this person , I don't say good, bad, or , but you turn on that stupid CNN, you turn on MSDNC , (laughter) , you turn on Fox, every story is Trump or Trump related, right? There's no , if a plane goes down with 700 people on it, they don't even cover it anymore. That used to be a big event. They don't cover it anymore. It's really unfair. But it's been , by the way, have we all had a great time, though? This journey. This journey, right? (Applause.) This journey has been amazing. You know, I tell the story , a month before I ran, I said to my wife, 'Well, I'm thinking about it.' Said to a couple, 'Eh, I'm thinking about it.' Didn't think too much about it. I thought about it like a day before I ran. (Laughter.) But I remember seeing the New York Times. It came to my office, I held it up, it was like a thing you hand out at a grocery store. You know, it would have blown away with a little wind , about two miles an hour, it would have blown away. That was the New York Times. Now it's a vibrant paper. But when I'm no longer here in 5 years or 9 years or 13 years or 17 years, 21, 25. (Applause.) No, they actually think I'm not leaving, you know. This crazy Bill Maher. Bill Maher, you ever hear of this guy? He says, 'You know he's not leaving.' He has a guest , some guest that didn't have a clue. And the guest , he said, 'You know Trump is going to win? You know that, don't you? He's going to win. You know he's going to win, don't you?' That guy is devastated. Bill Maher. He's a nut job. 'You know he's going to win.' And the guest says, 'No, no, we're going to fight very hard. We think we have a good chance.' 'No, no, he's going to win. And then, you know what? He's never leaving, don't you? He's never leaving.' (Laughter.) 'No, no, he's never leaving. No, no, he's got it work- , he will never leave. There is no way.' And I used to think he was kidding. He's not. He is a total nut job, this guy. (Laughter.) But under my administration, the great betrayal of America is over. It is no longer for sale. (Applause.) Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe, and I signed the brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. A great job. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and workers all across our country. And, by the way, speaking of farmers, something they don't know but they're learning fast: No more estate tax on your small farm, small businesses, small other things. (Applause.) No more estate tax. People don't talk about it. It's a big thing , big provision. Big provision. If you love your children, it's great. If you don't love your children, it's irrelevant. Don't leave the money to them. (Laughter.) But, you know, in years gone by, great farmers , they have a good land, good everything , but they don't make that much cash. It's a tough business, right? And the banks would come in, loan money to the children, and the banks would end up owning the property and all hell was going on. It was terrible. No more estate tax or, as we call it, 'death tax.' No more on small farms and small businesses. Right? (Applause.) Nobody talks about it. Nobody talks about that, but it's a big thing , if you love your children. If you don't , does anybody here not love your children? Raise your hand, please. (Laughter.) Look at that, not one hand. Well, that's conservative people. They all love their children, right? (Applause.) Oh, there's one hand in the back. I'm not calling him. (Laughter.) I also took the strongest-ever action to confront China's illicit trade practices. You see what happened there. (Applause.) And our strategy worked. And we have a great relationship with China now. We have a very good relationship. They didn't even respect us. They were taking out $500 billion a year. We had a trade imbalance. We had a deficit of more than $500 billion, with a 'B,' dollars a year. Can you believe that? Who the hell can sustain , who wants to even talk about that? So we started charging tariffs. They hit our farmers. I gave the farmers everything that they took out, and the money came from China because it came out of the tariffs. And we had a lot of money left over. A long, complicated story, but not really complicated. No other President ever thought of it. And now the farmers love me, and we ended up making a great deal. (Applause.) But they loved me before. You know, the farmers, when they'd go to , CNN would go up, 'Is it terrible what President Trump is doing to you with trade war?' He says, 'No. It's hurting me badly, but the trade war is necessary. And it should have been done years ago.' Every one , I've never heard anybody say different. (Applause.) I've never heard anybody say different. The farmers are unbelievable. But I went to Sonny Perdue, our Secretary of Agriculture. I said, 'So let me ask you, Chinese is tough; they're smart. They hit them. How much did they take care out last year?' 'Twelve billion dollars.' 'How much did they take out this year?' 'Sixteen billion dollars.' That was last year. I said, '$16 billion, $12 billion, good. We're going to give them back the $12 billion.' Then we gave back the 16. Everything they took out. I said, 'What was the best year they ever had with China?' It was $16 billion. I said, 'Good. I'll give them , I'll reimburse them the $16 billion out of the tariffs that China is paying.' And, by the way, you know, China respects this, just so you understand. You know, other Presidents knew that they were getting ripped off. They didn't know what to do about it. They said, 'They'll attack our farmers. Our whole farmer , all the farmers will go bust.' They didn't know. Charge them tariffs, pay them back, and then keep a hell of a lot more money than you're even giving to the farmers. And we kept tens of billions of dollars. (Applause.) And we made our first deal, and Schumer went, 'It's terrible, the deal. He got , he took the tariffs out.' No, nobody wanted tariffs until I taught them what tariffs are. But 'It's terrible. He went and took the tariffs out.' Actually, I didn't. They're paying 25 percent on $250 billion. I don't even know how we pulled off that one. (Laughter.) But they're paying , But China is great, and now they want to negotiate phase two, because they want to stop paying the 25 percent on $250 billion. Otherwise, we have no leverage, right? We have no leverage. (Applause.) But the farmers are the greatest. And even before they knew I was going to be able to reimburse them all that money that was being taken out of their pockets, they were , they said to me , I had 25 farmers in the White House, right in the Cabinet Room. I use the Cabinet Room. Everybody else used it only for the Cabinet. I use it for everything but the Cabinet. (Laughter.) No, I use it for farmers. We have beautiful , it's this incredible room. Right? This incredible room. And I said to the farmers , I said, 'You know, I want to give you back money. I want to give you a subsidy.' 'Oh, we don't want the word ' , they didn't want , everybody else, they didn't care what I used. I could use 'subsidy.' I could use 'welfare.' I could use any word I wanted. The farmers hated the word 'subsidies.' 'Sir we don't want anything. We just want a level playing field. It's been this way for 20 years. And it's been it's been absolutely hurting us.' (Applause.) They didn't want anything. And I said, 'You know, are you serious?' They said, 'Yeah, we just want a level playing field. Nobody can beat us.' And it's true, nobody can beat. They want a level playing field. And I said to myself, 'Can you imagine, everybody that comes in , countries, other businesses, everybody , they want money. The farmers don't. They just wanted a level playing field.' And that was at the bottom, when they really were looking , it was looking pretty bad. But now, China is going to be buying $50 billion worth of product. The most they ever , remember , got was 16, so they're buying 50. We agreed to 20. And in the final day, they were getting the agreements ready. I said, 'How much are the farmers getting?' Meaning, how much is China going to purchase from our farmers? 'Twenty billion.' I said, 'Do me a favor, make it 50.' They said, '50?' I said, 'The farmers can't do that much, can they?' They said, 'No.' China said, 'Absolutely not.' I said, 'Look, what does it mean? You got 1.5 billion people. What the hell difference between 20 billion and 50? It doesn't mean anything.' They said, 'You're right. We'll give you 50.' It's crazy. It's crazy. (Applause.) My only problem is I don't think the farmers can produce that much. It's going to be very good to be a farmer when that whole thing kicks in. We understand that our First Lady and highest , and you have to remember this: When our First Lady came out, she said to me today, 'Say hello to everybody.' And she said that, 'Your first duty and your highest loyalty' , and this was coming right from her , 'is to the American citizens. And you really have to let the people know.' This is , Melania told me this. Can you believe this? (Applause.) She's like giving me a history lesson. Our First Lady is giving me a history , (applause) , Our highest loyalty to the American people. I said, 'Okay.' That was pretty good. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'll tell her. I'll tell her that was the single-best line in the whole speech. (Laughter.) Nowhere has the American Left more thoroughly violated this sacrosanct principle than on immigration. Illegal immigration costs American taxpayers hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year, funds that could be used to improve our schools, roads, hospitals, and other vital services. Instead, Democrats want to take even more of your money to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free federal welfare, free education. They get treated better than they want to treat our military and our vets. And I stopped it. But it's crazy. The Democrat Party's immigration policies empower bloodthirsty cartels that maim, murder, and torture; that smuggle and traffic innocent human beings; that flood our communities with poisonous drugs. The Left's immigration policies are not compassionate; they are heartless, merciless, and cruel. Countless Americans are killed every year by criminal aliens. These are illegal aliens that come in, and they are, in many cases, very bad people. In Houston, Texas, an illegal alien was charged with the murder for killing a 75-year-old grandmother in her home, stabbing her with a vicious machete knife 13 times in the chest. In Georgia, an illegal alien was charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. Yet despite these travesties, the far-Left supports deadly sanctuary cities where people like that get protection. They release criminal alien predators into innocent communities rather than handing them over to our great heroes of ICE. (Applause.) ICE. They take such abuse. ICE , the toughest gangs in the world, MS-13. They slice people up. ICE takes them out by the thousands. (Applause.) Nobody else wants that job. The men over here don't want that job, I can tell you right now. They're tough and they love our country, but they got to be tough. Last year, California sanctuary law forced a single county to release over 1,000 convicted criminal aliens, and nearly 240 have already been arrested, and they're looking for others. And those are just the crimes that we know about. Montgomery County, Maryland, announced a sanctuary policy last July. Since then, at least 10 illegal immigrants have been arrested for sex crimes, including the rape of an 11-year-old girl. In Seattle, officials released a known MS-3 , think of this , this was a known MS-13 gang member who later beat a 16-year-old boy with a baseball bat and hacked him to death with a machete. The list goes on and on and on. And these people are protected by their sanctuary cities fools.In my State of the Union Address, I called at Congress to pass legislation allowing the victims of these deadly policies to sue these sanctuary cities for the pain, anguish, and suffering they inflict on our people. (Applause.) Everyone here today, and patriotic citizens all across our land, agree with a fundamental truth: Our country must be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. (Applause.) The Left's crazy mantra is: no borders, no nations, and no more deportations. They don't want to deport. Crazy Bernie said he'll never do a deportation. Right? Remember what he said? I better save this stuff. Maybe he won't get the nomination. I don't want to , I won't say that he said , he thinks the Boston bombers, right? , the Boston guys, right? , he said they have the right to vote. He said prisoners in prison have the right to vote. They said, 'Does that include the Boston maniac that's scheduled to die?' Death penalty, which is very good. 'But does that include that?' He said, 'Yes, he would get the right to vote.' You believe that, that this guy would get the right to vote? So I said I won't use that until later on. And I used it today at CPAC, and now he'll find a way of getting out of it, and I won't be able to use it against him in the campaign. That's no god. (Laughter.) See what I do here, Matt? That's too bad. (Laughter.) Too early. I got to wait until about two months before the vote, right? Right? She's going, 'Yes, please wait.' Except then you wouldn't have enjoyed that. But it's true. It's true. Yeah, it's okay for him to vote. It's fine. He can , he killed many people, badly maimed and wounded many people, and he's got the right to vote. Can you believe that this is where we've come? We believe in strong borders, sovereign nations, and the prompt deportation of anyone who illegally breaks into our country. (Applause.) And thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal crossings by a staggering 75 percent. (Applause.) We have ended catch and release, the worst of all the loopholes. (Applause.) We have seized a record amount of drugs and deported a record number of gang members. We are building the powerful border wall. We're already up to 128 miles of border wall. And you think that was easy? (Applause.) It's being built. And it's being built to the highest standard you can build it. You know, just to show you again about the news: So we're building it, and part of it is desert, it's rough territory and very tough territory, in many ways. But the winds are blowing, and they're putting it up, and it's 30 feet high , steel and concrete both. And you have to be able to see through it. Very expensive. It's the ultimate wall in terms of , we went to Border Patrol. They did a study; they hired people, climbers. What's the hardest to climb? The piece on top. That's called an 'anti-climb provision.' Supposedly, it makes it harder. Who knows? But I said, 'Do it.' Another couple of bucks. (Laughter.) But we put up a wall, and it was blowing 50, 60 miles an hour in this territory. The concrete was just poured; it was soaking wet. The wall came down, and we end up with a big story. 'Trump's wall gets blown over by the wind.' That's what it is. But I explained , because when you have Twitter, where you have so many millions of people, all you have to do is say: 'Scam.' Scam. (Applause.) We can get the word out. Now we , we lifted it right back up and put it back,"}

We extend our support to those brave individuals battling colon and rectal cancers and encourage them to always keep up the fight. Colorectal cancer accounts for 50,000 deaths each year, the third most among all types of cancers. Colorectal cancers affect people of every race and ethnicity, and are most prominent in people over the age of 50. Furthermore, colorectal cancers do not always show symptoms in the early stages, often resulting in diagnoses at advanced or more aggressive stages. Screening for colorectal cancer can lead to early detection, when treatment is more effective, and it can even prevent the development of cancer by removing polyps in the colon before they become cancerous. It is estimated that 60 percent of deaths related to colorectal cancer could have been prevented with early detection. This statistic reflects just how critical it is for all men and women to regularly check in with their medical provider and apply all preventative measures recommended to improve their overall health and wellbeing. While screening is recommended for all adults ages 50 to 75, having a family history of colorectal cancer increases your risk and may require screening before age 50. That is why familiarizing yourself with your family and medical history and talking to your doctor about it are so important. While cancer is a horrible disease that affects millions, there is reason for optimism in the medical community. American innovation is spurring advancements in cancer treatments, and the Department of Health and Human Services recently reported that mortality rates for most cancers are continuing to fall among men, women, and children in the United States. Through increased knowledge about preventative lifestyle habits, early detection, and research leading to enhanced treatments, cancer, including colorectal cancer, can be prevented or treated, and remission is possible. During National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, we also recognize the community of individuals who work tirelessly throughout our country to ensure that people are informed, diagnosed, and treated promptly. Without the efforts of medical researchers and staff and public health professionals, we would not have had the successes that we have seen in recent years. While cancer rates continue to fall, we must continue to push forward so that more people receive the information they need to prevent and treat all cancers, including colorectal cancer. Most importantly, we must keep everyone who has lost a friend or loved one to this disease in our hearts and encourage those brave Americans who are currently battling any form of cancer to keep fighting.

EDT THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans: Tonight, I want to speak with you about our nation's unprecedented response to thecoronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world. Today, the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic. We have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshalling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people. This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history. I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens, and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus. From the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges, including large-scale and very dangerous health threats. This is the way it always was and always will be. It only matters how you respond, and we are responding with great speed and professionalism. Our team is the best anywhere in the world. At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection. And taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe. The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe. After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and wellbeing of all Americans. To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground. There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing. These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom. At the same time, we are monitoring the situation in China and in South Korea. And, as their situation improves, we will reevaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening. Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all copayments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing. We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus. Additionally, last week, I signed into law an $8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments, and distribution of medical supplies. Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly, day by day. We are moving very quickly. The vast majority of Americans: The risk is very, very low. Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus. The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful. In particular, we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits. In general, older Americans should also avoid nonessential travel in crowded areas. My administration is coordinating directly with communities with the largest outbreaks, and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing, and reducing large gatherings. Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow. Every community faces different risks and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts , and they are the best. For all Americans, it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene. Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus. Wash your hands, clean often-used surfaces, cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough, and most of all, if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home. To ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief. This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to coronavirus. I will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief. Because of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Our banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong. Our unemployment is at a historic low. This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves, and resources to handle any threat that comes our way. This is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world. However, to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, tonight I am announcing the following additional actions: I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus. Effective immediately, the SBA will begin providing economic loans in affected states and territories. These low-interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus. To this end, I am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50 billion. Using emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments, without interest or penalties, for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted. This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy. Finally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief. Hopefully they will consider this very strongly. We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus. We made a life-saving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe. We will not delay. I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health, and safety of the American people. I will always put the wellbeing of America first. If we are vigilant , and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will , we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus. The virus will not have a chance against us. No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States. We have the best economy, the most advanced healthcare, and the most talented doctors, scientists, and researchers anywhere in the world. We are all in this together. We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship, and unify together as one nation and one family. As history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity. Our future remains brighter than anyone can imagine. Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens, and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you. END 9:12 P.M.

Today, as our Nation and entire global community continue to combat the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, we reaffirm our commitment to do our part to stop the spread of this virus, care for the sick, and protect the health and well-being of our fellow Americans. Each of us should follow the simple and necessary precautions set forth in the President's Coronavirus Guidelines for America and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect ourselves, our families, and our communities from the coronavirus. These guidelines include critical steps we can take to slow the spread, such as practicing social distancing, avoiding discretionary travel, following the directions of your State and local authorities, including regarding temporary closures of bars, restaurants, gyms, and other common gathering places, and voluntarily wearing cloth face coverings when out in public. Importantly, if you are showing common symptoms and feeling sick, stay home and contact your medical provider to discuss next steps in diagnosing and treating your symptoms. Additionally, older Americans and those who have serious underlying health conditions or other risk factors should take extra precautions to mitigate the risk of contracting the coronavirus. By adhering to these recommendations, as well as practicing good sanitation and hygiene habits, we are all helping win the battle against this invisible enemy. The coronavirus pandemic has posed intense hardships on our society, but the strength, resiliency, and compassion of the American people are far greater. Each day, we are seeing the remarkable ways in which the men and women of our great Nation are helping others. One especially critical way healthy Americans can assist in filling a critical need brought on by this pandemic is by continuing to donate blood. The American Red Cross is currently facing a dire blood shortage. If you are of good health and satisfy the eligibility requirements, the process to donate blood is safe, and your donation is needed now more than ever. To learn more about additional ways in which you can help those affected by the coronavirus outbreak, please visit www.fema.gov\/coronavirus\/how-to-help. The United States will defeat this invisible enemy. On this World Health Day, Melania and I join a grateful Nation in paying tribute to all of our doctors, nurses, healthcare administrators, researchers, scientists, educators, public health officials, and all of the extraordinary men and women who are helping diagnose, heal, inform, protect, and reassure the American people.

Importantly, if you are showing common symptoms and feeling sick, stay home and contact your medical provider to discuss next steps in diagnosing and treating your symptoms. Additionally, older Americans and those who have serious underlying health conditions or other risk factors should take extra precautions to mitigate the risk of contracting the coronavirus. By adhering to these recommendations, as well as practicing good sanitation and hygiene habits, we are all helping win the battle against this invisible enemy. The coronavirus pandemic has posed intense hardships on our society, but the strength, resiliency, and compassion of the American people are far greater. Each day, we are seeing the remarkable ways in which the men and women of our great Nation are helping others. One especially critical way healthy Americans can assist in filling a critical need brought on by this pandemic is by continuing to donate blood. The American Red Cross is currently facing a dire blood shortage. If you are of good health and satisfy the eligibility requirements, the process to donate blood is safe, and your donation is needed now more than ever. To learn more about additional ways in which you can help those affected by the coronavirus outbreak, please visit The United States will defeat this invisible enemy. On this World Health Day, Melania and I join a grateful Nation in paying tribute to all of our doctors, nurses, healthcare administrators, researchers, scientists, educators, public health officials, and all of the extraordinary men and women who are helping diagnose, heal, inform, protect, and reassure the American people. Together, we will emerge from this challenge stronger, healthier, and more united than ever before."}

As our Nation has faced the unique challenges posed by the coronavirus during the past few weeks, we have turned to God for guidance, comfort, and hope. Throughout this difficult period, we have witnessed the core tenets of Christianity, love, compassion, and kindness, reflected in the many acts of courage, generosity, and caring of the American people. Our country's citizens have taken to heart the words of 1 Peter 4:10: \"Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms.\" Countless Americans have selflessly answered the calls for help in their communities and have performed extraordinary acts to help their neighbors in times of need. Healthcare workers and medical professionals have worked tirelessly to heal the sick, and thousands of volunteers, first responders, critical workers, and businesses have contributed their time and resources to help defeat this virus. No matter the circumstances, we will always celebrate Easter as a time of rejuvenation, rebirth, and a renewed sense of purpose and faith. The coronavirus will not stop Easter. Even in the darkest hours, God's abundant love and mercy are unwavering. The light of Christ will always triumph over the trials and tribulations we face because He has defeated death. Today, let us take a little extra time to pray for the strength of our country and our people, and ask that God hold all Americans in the palm of His hand.

America's teachers have risen to the challenge by developing and implementing imaginative, creative, and resourceful strategies to bring their classrooms and lesson plans into the homes of their students. These adaptations to implement distance education are a reminder of the phenomenal work educators perform every day to ensure that our Nation's young people have ample access to valuable learning opportunities.

During National Women's Health Week, we call attention to the health needs and conditions that are unique to our mothers, sisters, wives, daughters, and friends, and we recommit to improving the quality of care and resources available to women. By working together, we can help support all women and build a stronger, healthier America. Over the past few months, women have played a major role in our Nation's healthcare response to the coronavirus pandemic, and we have tremendous appreciation for their work. Countless courageous women are serving on the frontlines as physicians, law enforcement officers, nurses, health assistants, health aides, technicians, and critical infrastructure workers. Many of these vital personnel are at a heightened risk of acquiring the coronavirus due to their exposure to infected patients and the public at large, and we will continue working to protect their health as they defend the American people. Our Nation has made tremendous progress in advancing medical care and treatment for many diseases, but cancer still poses a tremendous health challenge to all Americans, particularly women. Early detection through regular screening tests can help identify these cancers when treatment is likely to work best, which substantially reduces the risk of death. Doctors recommend that, starting at age 50, most women have a mammogram every other year to screen for breast cancer. This screening test is critical in helping identify cancer before symptoms appear and can detect a tumor before it can be seen or felt by a physical examination alone. By raising awareness of practices such as these, we can help continue to reduce the number of women's lives lost to cancer. Americans also continue to be affected by the ongoing opioid crisis. The rate of opioid overdoses over the past two decades has increased more quickly for women than it has for men, and women who are pregnant or postpartum often face barriers to accessing treatment and recovery services for substance use disorders. My Administration remains dedicated to fighting the opioid crisis and leveraging a whole-of-government approach to stop the abuse of opioids. For the first time in decades, drug overdose deaths have fallen from their peak levels. We are making real progress in saving lives, helping those struggling with addiction and reducing stigma. Together, we will continue building a society that values the dignity of every life and helps all Americans realize their full potential. Additionally, we must continue working to assist women with disabilities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in four women have a disability in America. It is critical that women with disabilities have access to healthcare. These women need the same general healthcare as women without disabilities, and, they may also require access to specialty care and other services to address their particular health or functional needs. We also want to encourage all Americans who are facing mental health issues, including depression. Studies indicate that women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with depression. As we have made tremendous progress in lowering the mortality rate among women for cancer, we must also work to improve their access to mental health resources and treatment and remove the stigmas associated with mental health issues. If you or someone you know is suffering from depression or any mental illness, please know that you are not alone and that resources are available. Today and always, we recognize the importance of women in our lives and resolve to do all we can as a Nation to promote women's health. During this National Women's Health Week, we commit to using every resource at our disposal to invest in their well-being, which will help strengthen our country and build a better future for all Americans.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1422858\/presidential-message-on-national-womens-health-week-2020&speechType=6","Summary":"Women Health and Health Care","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/presidential-message-national-womens-health-week-2020\/","CleanText":"Since our Nation's founding, women have made immeasurable contributions to our country's history, success, and prosperity.

But we've moved our best people into Michigan and our most talented engineers, designers, the people from the Army Corps of Engineers. And they do these things better than probably anyone , anyone in the world. Q What about the funding, though, that you threatened to take away the federal funding? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we'll take a look. No, we'll take a look. That was unrelated to that. Q Can you explain why you're pulling out of the Open Skies Treaty? THE PRESIDENT: Russia and us have developed a very good relationship. As you know, we worked on the oil problem together. I think we have a very good relationship with Russia. But Russia didn't adhere to the treaty, so until they adhere, we will pull out. But there's a very good chance we'll make a new agreement or do something to put that agreement back together. But whenever there's an agreement that another party doesn't agree to , you know, we have many of those agreements around the world, where it's a two-party agreement, but they don't adhere to it and we do. When we have things like that, we pull out also. That's why, with the arms treaties, if you look at the arms treaties, we're probably going to make a deal with Russia on arms treaty. And China will be maybe included in that. We'll see what happens. But we have a lot of things. But when we have an agreement, when we have a treaty, and the other side doesn't adhere to it , in many cases, they're old treaties, old agreements , then we pull out also. So I think what's going to happen is we're going to pull out and they're going to come back and want to make a deal. We've had a very good relationship lately with Russia. And you can see that with respect to oil and what's happening with oil. Q What do you think about Michael Cohen getting out of jail today? He's home now. THE PRESIDENT: I didn't know that. Q He's home. What do you think about that? THE PRESIDENT: I didn't know it. Nope. I didn't know it. Q Do you have a reaction? Q Isn't that going to increase tensions with Russia, though, right when you want to make things better? THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q Isn't this withdrawal going to make things be- , worse with Russia? Increase tensions? THE PRESIDENT: No, I think that we're going to have a very good relationship with Russia. I think that if you look at what happened with oil, where Russia, Saudi Arabia, and us got together, and we saved in our country millions of energy jobs. And you see oil now is solidifying. So it's the best of all worlds. We're saving the energy jobs but our drivers have a very low gasoline price. Q Are you going to wear a mask today at the Ford plant? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don't know. We're going to look at it. A lot of people have asked me that question. I want to get our country back to normal. I want to normalize. One of the other things I want to do is get the churches open. The churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of the Democrat governors. I want to get our churches open. And we're going to take a very strong position on that very soon. Q What about mosques, Mr. President? What about mosques? The Muslims are going to be celebrating the end of Ramadan soon. What about mosques? THE PRESIDENT: Mosques too, yeah. Including mosques. Q Do you have any messages for , THE PRESIDENT: Including mosques. Q Do you have any messages for the Muslims who will be celebrating the end of Ramadan? THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I wish them well , very well. Go ahead. Q Can you talk about the AstraZeneca award? A billion dollars for 400 million doses of a potential new vaccine. How confident are you that one will be ready by the fall? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think we have a lot of , you have AstraZeneca, which is a great company, and you have others, Johnson & Johnson. We have a lot of things happening on the vaccine front, on the therapeutic front. If you look at therapeutically, we're doing great. And on the cure front , which is the next step , I think we have tremendous things. That announcement, I heard, came out this morning. That's a very positive announcement in addition to all of the other announcements. We are so far ahead of where people thought we'd be. But therapeutically, it's very interesting what's going on , and cure. So you're going to have a lot big announcements over the next week or two. Q Sir, you said the funding to Michigan was another issue not related to the flood. Can you just assure people that are concerned you're going to hold funding? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we're helping Michigan with their flood, and we have the people to do it. Q But what about the funding though? You said federal funding for the mail-in voting. THE PRESIDENT: We don't want them to do mail-in ballots because it's going to lead to total election fraud. So we don't want them to do mail-in ballots. We don't want anyone to do mail-in ballots. Now, if somebody has to mail it in because they're sick or, by the way, because they live in the White House and they have to vote in Florida and they won't be in Florida , if there's a reason for it, that's okay. If there's a reason. But if there's not , we don't want , we don't to take any chances with fraud in our elections. Q The Chinese Parliament is poised to pass a national security law cracking down on Hong Kong. Are you aware of this? What's your reaction? THE PRESIDENT: I don't know what it is because nobody knows yet. If it happens, we'll address that issue very strongly. Q What about your plan for G7, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT: So it looks like G7 may be on because we've done well. We're ahead of schedule in terms of our country, and some of the other countries are doing very well. It looks like G7 will be on. A full G7. And we'll be announcing something probably early next week. Q Will it be June 10th? And how many world leaders have agreed? THE PRESIDENT: I can't hear you. You have your mask on. I can't hear a word you're , Q How many world leaders have agreed to your June 10th plan? THE PRESIDENT: We'll be talking to you about it. Q Sir, how long do you expect take hydroxychloroquine? THE PRESIDENT: I think it's another day. I had a two-week regimen of hydroxychloroquine. And I've taken it, I think, just about two weeks. I think it's another day. And I'm still here. I'm still here. And I tested very positively in a , in another sense. So, this morning , Q Negatively? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. I tested positively toward negative, right? So, no, I tested perfectly this morning, meaning , meaning I tested negative. Q Have you taken the antibody test yet? THE PRESIDENT: But that's a way of saying it: positively toward the negative. Q Have you taken the antibody test yet, sir? THE PRESIDENT: No, I have not. Q Columbia University put out a report in The New York Times today. It said 36,000 people would've been saved if you guys did social distancing measures just one week earlier. Do you believe that? What's your reaction to that? THE PRESIDENT: I was so early. I was earlier than anybody thought. I put a ban on people coming in from China. Everybody fought me on that. They didn't want it. Nancy Pelosi, a month later, was dancing in the streets of San Francisco in Chinatown so that people wouldn't believe what's happening. And I don't even blame that. But I was way early. Columbia is an institution that's very liberal. It's a , I think it's a just a political hit job, if you want to know the truth. Q So, do you want to have the G7 here at the White House or Camp David or what? THE PRESIDENT: We're going to have it probably at the White House and maybe a little combination at Camp David. But primarily at the White House. So if we do the G7, when that all comes together, probably it will be in D.C., at the White House. Okay? But there could be a piece of it at Camp David, which is nearby. Q Are you taking antibody plasma? Q Back on Open Skies, have you talked to any allies , THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q , about this? THE PRESIDENT: So, again, our relationship with Russia has improved greatly, especially since the Russian hoax happened , has been proven totally false and illegal what they did. They , this was an illegal hoax and they got caught. They got caught doing a lot of bad things. So let's see how that turns out. But our relationship with Russia has come a long way in the last few months. I think that the Open Sky will all work out. But right now, when you have an agreement, and the other side doesn't adhere to the agreement, we're not going to adhere to it either. But I think something very positive will work out. Q Are you going to go to the launch on Wednesday in Florida? THE PRESIDENT: What? Q The launch , the rocket launch on Wednesday in Florida? THE PRESIDENT: I'm thinking about going. That'll be next week to the rocket launch. I hope you're all going to join me. I'd like to put you on the rocket, get rid of you for a while. (Laughter.) Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, Steve.

EDT THE PRESIDENT: I stand before you at this noble fortress of American liberty to pay tribute to the immortal souls who fought and died to keep us free. Earlier today, the First Lady and I laid a wreath in their sacred honor at Arlington National Cemetery. Now we come together to salute the flag they gave their lives to so boldly and brilliantly defend. And we pledge, in their cherished memories, that this majestic flag will proudly fly forever. We're joined for today's ceremony by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper; Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley; Congressman Andy Harris; and a number of service members and veterans of the Armed Forces. The dignity, daring, and devotion of the American military is unrivaled anywhere in history and any place in the world. In recent months, our nation and the world have been engaged in a new form of battle against an invisible enemy. Once more, the men and women of the United States military have answered the call to duty and raced into danger. Tens of thousands of service members and National Guardsmen are on the frontlines of our war against this terrible virus , caring for patients, delivering critical supplies, and working night and day to safeguard our citizens. As one nation, we mourn alongside every single family that has lost loved ones, including the families of our great veterans. Together, we will vanquish the virus, and America will rise from this crisis to new and even greater heights. As our brave warriors have shown us from our nation's earliest days: In America, we are the captains of our own fate. No obstacle, no challenge, and no threat is a match for the sheer determination of the American people. This towering spirit permeates every inch of the hallowed soil beneath our feet. In this place, more than 200 years ago, American patriots stood their ground and repelled a British invasion in the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. Early on a September morning in 1814, the British fleet launched an assault on this peninsula. From the harbor, some 30 British warships attacked this stronghold. Rockets rained down. Bombs burst in the air. In the deck of one ship, a gallant young American was held captive. His name was Francis Scott Key. For 25 hours, Key watched in dismay as fire crashed down upon this ground. But through torrents of rain and smoke and the din of battle, Key could make out 15 broad stripes and 15 bright stars , barraged and battered, but still there. American forces did not waver. They did not retreat. They stared down the invasion and the held that they had to endure. The fact is, they held like nobody could have held before. They held this fort. The British retreated. Independence was saved. Francis Scott Key was so inspired by the sight of our flag in the battle waged that the very grounds that he fought on became hallowed and he wrote a poem. His ageless words became the anthem of our nation: \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Every time we sing our anthem, every time its rousing chorus swells our hearts with pride, we renew the eternal bonds of loyalty to our fallen heroes. We think of the soldiers who spent their final heroic moments on distant battlefields to keep us safe at home. We remember the young Americans who never got the chance to grow old but whose legacy will outlive us all. In every generation, these intrepid souls kissed goodbye to their families and loved ones. They took flight in planes, set sail in ships, and marched into battle with our flag, fighting for our country, defending our people. When the cause of liberty was in jeopardy, American warriors carried that flag through ice and snow to victory at Trenton. They hoisted it up the masts of great battleships in Manila Bay. They fought through hell to raise it high atop a remote island in the Pacific Ocean called Iwo Jima. From the Philippine Sea to Fallujah, from New Orleans to Normandy, from Saratoga to Saipan, from the Battle of Baltimore to the Battle of the Bulge, Americans gave their lives to carry that flag through piercing waves, blazing fires, sweltering deserts, and storms of bullets and shrapnel. They climbed atop enemy tanks, jumped out of burning airplanes, and leapt on live grenades. Their love was boundless. Their devotion was without limit. Their courage was beyond measure. Army Green Beret Captain Daniel Eggers grew up in Cape Coral, Florida, determined to continue his family's tradition of military service , and it was a great tradition. He attended the legendary Citadel Military College in South Carolina. Soon, he met a beautiful cadet, Rebecca. They fell in love, married, and had two sons. In 2004, Daniel left for his second deployment in Afghanistan. On the morning of May 29th, Daniel and his team were courageously pursuing a group of deadly terrorists when he was killed by an improvised explosive device. This week is the 16th anniversary of the day that Daniel made the supreme sacrifice for our nation. He laid down his life to defeat evil and to save his fellow citizens. At the time of his death, Daniel's sons Billy and John were three and five years old. Today, they have followed in Daniel's footsteps , both students at the Citadel planning to serve in the military. Their amazing mom Rebecca has now served more than 23 years in the U.S. Army. Everywhere she goes, she wears Daniel's Gold Star pin on the lapel of her uniform. Colonel Rebecca Eggers and her two sons are here today, along with Daniel's father Bill and mother Margo. To the entire Eggers family: Your sacrifice is beyond our ability to comprehend or repay. Today, we honor Daniel's incredible life and exceptional valor, and we promise you that we will cherish his blessed memory forever. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Please. Thank you. Thank you. Great family. Thank you very much. To every Gold Star family here today and all across our land: Our debt to you is infinite and everlasting. We stand with you today and all days to come, remembering and grieving for America's greatest heroes. In spirit and strength, in loyalty and love, in character and courage, they were larger than life itself. They were angels sent from above, and they are now rejoined with God in the glorious Kingdom of Heaven. Wherever the Stars and Stripes fly , at our schools, our churches, town halls, firehouses, and national monuments , it is made possible because there are extraordinary Americans who are willing to brave death so that we can live in freedom and live in peace. In the two centuries since Francis Scott Key wrote about the stirring sight of our flag in battle, countless other American patriots have given their own testimony about the meaning of the flag. One was World War Two veteran Jim Krebs from Sunbury, Ohio. Jim and his twin brother Jack fought side by side in General Patton's Third Army. At the Battle of the Bulge, the twins volunteered for a dangerous mission. Together, they took out four enemy tanks, two machine gun nests, and a mothar [sic] position that was very powerful, loaded up with mortars. Jim's brother Jack was mortally wounded. Jim held his dying brother in his arms, praying together as his twin passed away. Jim fought to victory and came home to build a great American life. He married, had children, became an electrical engineer, and taught young people about war. As an old man, Jim was asked what about the American flag and what it meant to him. Jim said, \"The flag to me is as precious as the freedom that the flag stands for. It's as precious to me as the thousands of lives that have been lost defending her. It's that important to me; it gave me a value of life that I could have never gotten any other way. It gave me a value of my Lord, my family, my friends, loved ones, and especially my country. What more could I ask?\" Last month, Jim died peacefully at his home at the age of 94. This afternoon, we are greatly honored to be joined by his grandsons, Andy and Ron. Please, thank you very much. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you very much for being here. Today, as we remember the sacrifice of Jim's brother Jack, we honor Jim's service, and we are moved by his beautiful words. Andy and Ron, thank you for being here to remember your grandfather and his brother, and what they did for us all, and most importantly, what they stood for. From generation to generation, heroes like these have poured out their blood and sweat and heart and tears for our country. Because of them, America is strong and safe and mighty and free. Because of them, two centuries on, the Star Spangled Banner still proudly waves. For as long as our flag flies in the sky above, the names of these fallen warriors will be woven into its threads. For as long as we have citizens willing to follow their example, to carry on their burden, to continue their legacy, then America's cause will never fail and American freedom will never, ever die. Today, we honor the heroes we have lost. We pray for the loved ones they left behind. And with God as our witness, we solemnly vow to protect, preserve, and cherish this land they gave their last breath to defend and to defend so proudly. Thank you. God bless our military. God bless the memory of the fallen. God bless our Gold Star families. And God bless America. Thank you very much. (Applause.) END 12:16 P.M.

{"SpeechID":"VSDT2952020144","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-05-29","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump Announcing an Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship","Type":"statement","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. We're here today to defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in American history, frankly. And you know what's going as well as anybody. It's not good. A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communications in the United States. And we know what they are; we don't have to name them. We're going to give you a complete listing. We're going to give you a signed copy of what I'm going to be signing in a couple of minutes, and you'll see exactly what we're doing. They've had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens and large public audiences. There's no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction. And that includes individual people controlling vast amounts of territory. And we can't allow that to happen, especially when they go about doing what they're doing, because they're doing things incorrectly. They have points of view. And if we go by that, it's actually amazing that there was a success in 2016. But we can't let this continue to happen. It's very, very unfair. And you look at the statistics and you look at what is going on, and I think everybody would very much agree with that, including Democrats, by the way. I saw quite a few Democrats are saying this is about time something is done. So let's see if they keep that decision after they hear that we agree with them. The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress, edit, blacklist, shadow, ban are editorial decisions, pure and simple. They're editorial decisions. In those moments, Twitter ceases to be a neutral public platform, and they become an editor with a viewpoint. And I think we can say that about others also, whether you're looking at Google, whether you're looking at Facebook and perhaps others. One egregious example is when they try to silence views that they disagree with by selectively applying a \"fact check\" , a fact check , F-A-C-T. Fact check. What they choose to fact check and what they choose to ignore or even promote is nothing more than a political activism group or political activism. And it's inappropriate. If you look at what's happened, you look at where they're going, where they're coming from, I think you all see it yourselves. This censorship and bias is a threat to freedom itself. Imagine if your phone company silenced or edited your conversation. Social media companies have vastly more power and more reach than any phone company in the United States. More reach, actually, than your newspapers, by far. More reach than a lot of your traditional forms of communication. Therefore, today I'm signing an executive order to protect and uphold the free speech and rights of the American people. Currently, social media giants, like Twitter, receive an unprecedented liability shield based on the theory that they're a neutral platform , which they're not , not an editor with a viewpoint. My executive order calls for new regulations, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, to make it that social media companies that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield. That's a big deal. They have a shield; they can do what they want. They have a shield. They're not going to have that shield. My executive order further instructs the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, to prohibit social media companies from engaging in any deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce. This authority resides in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. I think you know it pretty well. Most of you know it very well. I would think you know it quite well, right? Additionally, I'm directing the Attorney General to work cooperatively with the states. He's going to be working very much and very closely in cooperation with the states to enforce their own laws against such deceptive business practices. The states have brought in powerful authority to regulate in this arena, and they'll be doing it also , and we encourage them to do it , if they see exactly as we've been seeing. It's , what they're doing is tantamount to monopoly, you can say. It's tantamount to taking over the airwaves. Can't let it happen. Otherwise, we're not going to have a democracy. We're not going to have anything to do with a republic. Finally, I'm directing my administration to develop policies and procedures to ensure taxpayer dollars are not going into any social media company that repress free speech. The government spends billions of dollars on giving them money. They're rich enough. So we're going to be doing none of it or a very little of it. As President, I'll not allow the American people to be bullied by these giant corporations. Many people have wanted this to be done by presidents for a long time. And now we're doing it. And I'm sure they'll be doing a lawsuit, and I'm also sure that we're going to be going for legislation, in addition to this. And the legislation will start immediately. And I'll tell you, I've been called by Democrats that want to do this, and so I think you could possibly have a bipartisan situation. But we're fed up with it, and it's unfair, and it's been very unfair. And we'll see what happens. Any questions? Q Mr. President, given your concern with Twitter, have you given any consideration to deleting your account, to just walking away from this platform you've been so critical of? THE PRESIDENT: Well, you know, if you weren't fake, I would not even think about it. I would do that in a heartbeat. Q I'm real, sir. THE PRESIDENT: But the news , the news is fake. We , if you look at what gets printed in newspapers, if only the public could understand where, you know, they're reading a story and they think it's real, and it's not real in so many cases. And I'm not saying in every case. You have some great journalists. You have some journalists that I have great respect for. But largely, I find, at least in a political sense, there is so much fake news, it's disgraceful. I would do that in a heartbeat if I had fair , if we had a fair press in this country, I would do that in a heartbeat. There's nothing I'd rather do than get rid of my whole Twitter account. But I'm able to get to, I guess, 186 million people, when you add up all the different accounts and add Facebook and Instagram. That's a lot of people. And that's more than the media companies have, frankly, by a lot. And so, if I get a story that's wrong, I can put a social media , I don't usually use the word \"Twitter\"; I use , I say \"social media.\" But I put something out, and the next day or the next hour or the next minute, everybody is reading about it. So I'm able to refute fake news, and that's very important. I'd like to ask the Attorney General, please, to say a couple of words. And he's very strongly behind it, backing it very powerfully. And again, we're going to be doing this, but we're also going through Congress. Please. ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR: Well, as you've mentioned, Mr. President, one of the things that I found has the broadest bipartisan support these days is the feeling that this provision, Section 230, has been stretched way beyond its original intention. And people feel that on both sides of the aisle. This was adopted 25 years ago to protect a fledgling industry, and its purpose was to allow websites that were serving as, essentially, bulletin boards for diverse third-party content coming on, to say that you're not responsible for the content of that third-party information. And it also tried to encourage these companies to take down things like child pornography or human trafficking advertising and things by saying, if you act to remove this kind of objectionable material, you won't be liable for taking it down. Now it's been completely stretched to allow what have become really behemoths who control a lot of the flow of information in our society to engage in censorship of that information and to act as editors and publishers of the material. So when they put on their own content , like \"fact check\" content , onto other people's content, and when they curate their collection, and when they start censoring particular content including, in many cases, at the direction of foreign governments like Communist China, they become publishers and they shouldn't be entitled to the same kind of shield that was set up earlier. Now, this executive order is a very strong step toward addressing this problem. It sets up a rulemaking procedure that will eventually be under the FCC to try to get back to the original interpretation and understanding of Section 230. It also empowers the Attorney General to work with state attorneys general to come up with model legislation that addresses this at the state level. And we're preparing federal legislation, which we will be sending over shortly for review at the Office of Management and Budget. So this is an important step to get back to the original understanding. You know, there's a bit of a bait-and-switch that's occurred in our society. These companies grew because they held themselves out as public forums, as free public forums where a variety of voices and diverse voices could come on and be heard. That's how they grew. That's how they attracted the eyeballs. That's why people joined them. But now that they have become these very powerful networks of eyeballs, now that they've grown by holding themselves out as free public forums, they've now switched. And they are using that market power to force particular viewpoints, and that's wrong. And it has to be addressed not only through this executive order, but I think litigation going forward and by further action on Capitol Hill. Thank you, Mr. President. Q Mr. President, not only , THE PRESIDENT: Do you have any questions for the Attorney General? Q Yes, actually, I do. Mr. Attorney General, not only have you been against Section 230, and the President has been against Section 230, the Vice President has said he's against Section 230. Do you believe that the executive order that the President is about to sign in any way repeals or amends Section 230? ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR: No, it doesn't repeal Section 230. And I'm not against Section 230 if it was properly interpreted and properly applied. But it's been stretched, and I don't know of anyone on Capitol Hill who doesn't agree that it's been stretched beyond its original intention. I think this will help it get back to the right balance. Q Mr. Attorney General, can you give us more details on the legislation both you and the President referred to? What do you want to do in that legislation? ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR: Well, we're still reviewing a number of possibilities. And it'd be premature for me to discuss the specifics. THE PRESIDENT: Well, one of the things we may do, Bill, is just remove or totally change 230. What I think we can say is we're going to regulate it. It's a provision, and we're going to regulate it. You take a look at this as an example; this was just out: \"Twitter Moments\" on the Mueller witch hunt. So, we won. We were in the right. You see what's happened. It's a total fraud. It was a total fraud. Seventy-six to one, okay? Seventy-six to one. You look at it. You think that's fair? Twitter classifies the term \"illegal alien\" as hate speech. \"Illegal alien.\" And viciously. You look at what China , I mean, just article after article. Here's one. This is our , this is the arbiter. This guy is the arbiter of what's supposed to go on Twitter. He's the one. He thought that , he thought , and he used CNN as a guide , CNN, which is fake news. He uses CNN as a guide. His name is Yoel Roth. And he's the one that said that mail-in balloting , you look, mail-in , no fraud. \"No fraud.\" Really? Why didn't you take a look all over the country? There's cases all over the country. If we went to mail-in balloting, our election all over the world would look as a total joke. It would be a total joke. There's such fraud and abuse. And you know about harvesting, where they harvest the ballots, and they go and grab them, and they go to people's houses, and then they say, \"sign here.\" No. Doesn't work. Now, an absentee ballot , you can't be there or you're sick, and you go and you register and you do all sorts of things to get that ballot, and there's good security measures. But when they send out , like in California , millions and millions of ballots to anybody that's breathing , anybody in California that's breathing, gets a ballot. Q But, Mr. President, that's not true. California , THE PRESIDENT: So here , here , excuse me. Wait a minute. I'm not finished. So here's your , here's your man, and that's on Twitter. And the amazing thing is he's wrong. And even no , no matter who it is, they will admit that he's wrong, because there's tremendous controversy on mail-in voting. And I can say this: The Republican Party cannot let that let it happen. Go ahead. Q But you know Gavin Newsom , Governor Newsom has , THE PRESIDENT: I do. I do. Q , has not sent ballots out to everybody in California. They're only going to registered voters. THE PRESIDENT: Oh, really? How many are there? Q So , so , THE PRESIDENT: How many are there? Q So what your tweet , THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q , said was , was not wrong , THE PRESIDENT: Okay, so , Q , or was not correct. It was wrong. THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Oh, really? So when he sends out 28 million ballots and they're in all the mailboxes, and kids go and they raid the mailboxes, and they hand them to people that are signing the ballots down the end of the street, which is happening , they grab the ballots , you don't think that happens? There's ballot harvesting where all of us , you know, we had seven elections for Congress, and they were, like, tied. And they lost every one of them because they came and they dropped the whole pile of ballots on the table. But you don't think they , they rip them out of mailboxes? It's all the time you read about it. You could read about it. Take a look. Q I mean, there are , THE PRESIDENT: They do worse than that. In some cases, they won't sell [sic] them, like to a Republican community , a conservative community. They don't happen to send the ballots to those communities. And there's no way of checking. No, you have to go and you have to vote. Voting is a great thing. Voting , we would be the laughingstock of the world. And if you just use common sense, you know that's going to happen. But they raid the mailboxes. They can even print ballots. They get the same paper, the same machine , nothing special , they get the same paper, the same machine. They print ballots. And Bill would have to do a great job to catch them doing it, or you state authorities would have to. But you have tremendous potential and you have tremendous fraud and abuse, but you have tremendous potential for fraud and abuse. Go ahead. Q Mr. President, you had said in one of your Twitter , in one of your tweets that you would consider shutting down Twitter and social media companies. Did you actually mean you would want to shut down an American company? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it's going to be , you know, I'll tell you what: I have so much, it seems, influence over Twitter in the sense of people wanting to see , go Twitter because of what I have. I have a vast number of , we have a number of platforms, as you know. We have millions and millions of people. I think this: If Twitter were not honorable , if you're going to have a guy like this be your judge and jury, I think just shut it down, as far as I'm concerned, but I'd have to go through a legal process to do that. Q But how would you shut down an American company? THE PRESIDENT: I don't know. I'd have to ask the lawyers. I'd have to go through a legal process. If it were legal, if it were able to be legally shut down, I would do it. I think I'd be hurting it very badly if we didn't use it anymore. I mean, we have other sites we could use, I guess, or we'd have to develop other sites. But , and I'm not just talking about Twitter. Look at Facebook. Look at the tribunal they set up on Facebook. This woman, who you remember testifying recently in Congress, her hatred was so incredible toward the Republican Party and me that there is no way you can get a fair trial. So this is not like it's supposed to be. This is not like it's supposed to be. So we're going to see what happens. And you know what? I guess it's going to be challenged in court. What isn't? But I think we'll do very well. Yeah. Go ahead. Q Mr. President , Q Mr. President , THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Go ahead. Q , as to potential litigation, can you discuss the timing of that? And what is the remedy that you're going to be seeking? ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR: No, what I was referring to, there is litigation going on all the time on Section 230 and its scope. So we would look for appropriate vehicles to weigh in and file statement of interest. Q So you wouldn't be filing an individual , ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR: Not necessarily. Q Okay. Thank you. Q Mr. President , THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. Please. Q Are you worried about the situation on the border between India and China? THE PRESIDENT: Ah, India. He loves India so much. He's never asked a question other than an India question, and that's okay. I just got back from India, right? Q I (inaudible) Indian, sir. THE PRESIDENT: I just beat COVID. Q You are very popular in India. THE PRESIDENT: I got back , I know. And they like me in India. I think they like me in India certainly more than the media likes me in this country. Q You're a rock star there because of Ahmedabad and , THE PRESIDENT: And I like Modi. I like your prime minister a lot. He's a great gentleman. A great gentleman. Yeah, they have a big conflict going with India and China. Is that what you're talking about? Yeah? Q Yes, sir. Yes, sir. THE PRESIDENT: They have a big conflict going with India and China. Two countries with 1.4 billion people. Two countries with very powerful militaries. And India is not happy, and probably China is not happy. But I can tell you, I did speak to Prime Minister Modi. He's not , he's notin a good mood about what's going on with China. Q Mr. President, have you spoken to , THE PRESIDENT: Wait. Are you finished? Q No, sir. So, yesterday, you tweeted about do you want to mediate between India and China on this issue. THE PRESIDENT: I would do that. You know, I would do that. If they , if they thought it would help if I were the mediator or the arbiter, I would do that. So, we'll see. Go ahead. Q Have you spoken to the family of George Floyd yet? THE PRESIDENT: No, I haven't. But I feel very, very badly. And it's a very shocking sight. Bill and I were talking about it before. It's one of the reasons Bill is here right now because, as you know, we're very much involved. And I've asked the Attorney General , FBI and the Attorney General to take a very strong look and to see what went on, because that was a very , a very bad thing that I saw. I saw it last night, and I didn't like it. Q Do you think those police officers should be prosecuted? THE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to make any comment right now. I can tell you I think what I saw was not good , was not good. Very bad. Q Mr. President , THE PRESIDENT: Anybody else? Q Mr. President, are you definitively staying in the U.S.-China trade deal? THE PRESIDENT: We'll be announcing what we're doing tomorrow with respect to China. And we are not happy with China. We are not happy with what's happened. All over the world, people are suffering. A hundred and eighty-six countries , all over the world they're suffering. We're not happy. Okay. Thank you very much, everybody. END 4:07 P.M.

We're here today to defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in American history, frankly. And you know what's going as well as anybody. It's not good. A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communications in the United States. And we know what they are; we don't have to name them. We're going to give you a complete listing. We're going to give you a signed copy of what I'm going to be signing in a couple of minutes, and you'll see exactly what we're doing. They've had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens and large public audiences. There's no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction. And that includes individual people controlling vast amounts of territory. And we can't allow that to happen, especially when they go about doing what they're doing, because they're doing things incorrectly. They have points of view. And if we go by that, it's actually amazing that there was a success in 2016. But we can't let this continue to happen. It's very, very unfair. And you look at the statistics and you look at what is going on, and I think everybody would very much agree with that, including Democrats, by the way. I saw quite a few Democrats are saying this is about time something is done. So let's see if they keep that decision after they hear that we agree with them. The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress, edit, blacklist, shadow, ban are editorial decisions, pure and simple. They're editorial decisions. In those moments, Twitter ceases to be a neutral public platform, and they become an editor with a viewpoint. And I think we can say that about others also, whether you're looking at Google, whether you're looking at Facebook and perhaps others. One egregious example is when they try to silence views that they disagree with by selectively applying a 'fact check' , a fact check , F-A-C-T. Fact check. What they choose to fact check and what they choose to ignore or even promote is nothing more than a political activism group or political activism. And it's inappropriate. If you look at what's happened, you look at where they're going, where they're coming from, I think you all see it yourselves. This censorship and bias is a threat to freedom itself. Imagine if your phone company silenced or edited your conversation. Social media companies have vastly more power and more reach than any phone company in the United States. More reach, actually, than your newspapers, by far. More reach than a lot of your traditional forms of communication. Therefore, today I'm signing an executive order to protect and uphold the free speech and rights of the American people. Currently, social media giants, like Twitter, receive an unprecedented liability shield based on the theory that they're a neutral platform , which they're not , not an editor with a viewpoint. My executive order calls for new regulations, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, to make it that social media companies that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield. That's a big deal. They have a shield; they can do what they want. They have a shield. They're not going to have that shield. My executive order further instructs the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, to prohibit social media companies from engaging in any deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce. This authority resides in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. I think you know it pretty well. Most of you know it very well. I would think you know it quite well, right? Additionally, I'm directing the Attorney General to work cooperatively with the states. He's going to be working very much and very closely in cooperation with the states to enforce their own laws against such deceptive business practices. The states have brought in powerful authority to regulate in this arena, and they'll be doing it also , and we encourage them to do it , if they see exactly as we've been seeing. It's , what they're doing is tantamount to monopoly, you can say. It's tantamount to taking over the airwaves. Can't let it happen. Otherwise, we're not going to have a democracy. We're not going to have anything to do with a republic. Finally, I'm directing my administration to develop policies and procedures to ensure taxpayer dollars are not going into any social media company that repress free speech. The government spends billions of dollars on giving them money. They're rich enough. So we're going to be doing none of it or a very little of it. As President, I'll not allow the American people to be bullied by these giant corporations. Many people have wanted this to be done by presidents for a long time. And now we're doing it. And I'm sure they'll be doing a lawsuit, and I'm also sure that we're going to be going for legislation, in addition to this. And the legislation will start immediately. And I'll tell you, I've been called by Democrats that want to do this, and so I think you could possibly have a bipartisan situation. But we're fed up with it, and it's unfair, and it's been very unfair. And we'll see what happens. Any questions?"}
{"SpeechID":"VSDT3052020139","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-05-30","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump on Actions Against China","Type":"statement","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Thank you. I'm here today to talk about our relationship with China and several new measures to protect American security and prosperity. China's pattern of misconduct is well known. For decades, they have ripped off the United States like no one has ever done before. Hundreds of billions of dollars a year were lost dealing with China, especially over the years during the prior administration. China raided our factories, offshored our jobs, gutted our industries, stole our intellectual property, and violated their commitments under the World Trade Organization. To make matters worse, they are considered a developing nation getting all sorts of benefits that others, including the United States, are not entitled to. But I never solely blamed China for this. They were able to get away with a theft like no one was able to get away with before because of past politicians and, frankly, past presidents. But unlike those who came before, my administration negotiated and fought for what was right. It's called: fair and reciprocal treatment. China has also unlawfully claimed territory in the Pacific Ocean, threatening freedom of navigation and international trade. And they broke their word to the world on ensuring the autonomy of Hong Kong. The United States wants an open and constructive relationship with China, but achieving that relationship requires us to vigorously defend our national interests. The Chinese government has continually violated its promises to us and so many other nations. These plain facts cannot be overlooked or swept aside. The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government. China's cover-up of the Wuhan virus allowed the disease to spread all over the world, instigating a global pandemic that has cost more than 100,000 American lives and over a million lives worldwide. Chinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to the World Health Organization and pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world when the virus was first discovered by Chinese authorities. Countless lives have been taken, and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe. They strongly recommended against me doing the early ban from China, but I did it anyway and was proven to be 100 percent correct. China has total control over the World Health Organization, despite only paying $40 million per year compared to what the United States has been paying, which is approximately $450 million a year. We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engage with them directly, but they have refused to act. Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving, urgent, global public health needs. The world needs answers from China on the virus. We must have transparency. Why is it that China shut off infected people from Wuhan to all other parts of China? It went nowhere else. It didn't go to Beijing; it went nowhere else. But allowed them to freely travel throughout the world, including Europe and the United States. The death and destruction caused by this is incalculable. We must have answers not only for us but for the rest of the world. This pandemic has underscored the crucial importance of building up America's economic independence, reshoring our critical supply chains and protecting America's scientific and technological advances. For years, the government of China has conducted illicit espionage to steal our industrial secrets, of which there are many. Today, I will issue a proclamation to better secure our nation's vital university research and to suspend the entry of certain foreign nationals from China who we have identified as potential security risks. I am also taking action to protect the integrity of America's financial system , by far, the best in the world. I am instructing my Presidential Working Group on Financial Markets to study the differing practices of Chinese companies listed on the U.S. financial markets, with the goal of protecting American investors. Investment firms should not be subjecting their clients to the hidden and undue risks associated with financing Chinese companies that do not play by the same rules. Americans are entitled to fairness and transparency. Several of the most significant actions we're taking pertain to the deeply troubling situations unfolding in Hong Kong. This week, China unilaterally imposed control over Hong Kong security. This was a plain violation of Beijing's treaty obligations with the United Kingdom in the Declaration of 1984 and explicit provisions of Hong Kong's Basic Law. It has 27 years to go. The Chinese government's move against Hong Kong is the latest in a series of measures that are diminishing the city's longstanding and very proud status. This is a tragedy for the people of Hong Kong, the people of China, and indeed the people of the world. China claims it is protecting national security. But the truth is that Hong Kong was secure and prosperous as a free society. Beijing's decision reverses all of that. It extends the reach of China's invasive state security apparatus into what was formerly a bastion of liberty. China's latest incursion, along with other recent developments that degraded the territory's freedoms, makes clear that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to warrant the special treatment that we have afforded the territory since the handover. China has replaced its promised formula of \"one country, two systems\" with \"one country, one system.\" Therefore, I am directing my administration to begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions that give Hong Kong different and special treatment. My announcement today will affect the full range of agreements we have with Hong Kong, from our extradition treaty to our export controls on dual-use technologies and more, with few exceptions. We will be revising the State Department's travel advisory for Hong Kong to reflect the increased danger of surveillance and punishment by the Chinese state security apparatus. We will take action to revoke Hong Kong's preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory from the rest of China. The United States will also take necessary steps to sanction PRC and Hong Kong officials directly or indirectly involved in eroding Hong Kong's autonomy and , just if you take a look, smothering , absolutely smothering Hong Kong's freedom. Our actions will be strong. Our actions will be meaningful. More than two decades ago, on a rainy night in 1997, British soldiers lowered the Union Flag, and Chinese soldiers raised the Chinese flag in Hong Kong. The people of Hong Kong felt simultaneously proud of their Chinese heritage and their unique Hong Kong identity. The people of Hong Kong hoped that in the years and decades to come, China would increasingly come to resemble its most radiant and dynamic city. The rest of the world was electrified by a sense of optimism that Hong Kong was a glimpse into China's future , not that Hong Kong would grow into a reflection of China's past. In every decision, I will continue to proudly defend and protect the workers, families, and citizens of the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. END 2:58 P.M.

We will take action to revoke Hong Kong's preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory from the rest of China. The United States will also take necessary steps to sanction PRC and Hong Kong officials directly or indirectly involved in eroding Hong Kong's autonomy and , just if you take a look, smothering , absolutely smothering Hong Kong's freedom. Our actions will be strong. Our actions will be meaningful. More than two decades ago, on a rainy night in 1997, British soldiers lowered the Union Flag, and Chinese soldiers raised the Chinese flag in Hong Kong. The people of Hong Kong felt simultaneously proud of their Chinese heritage and their unique Hong Kong identity. The people of Hong Kong hoped that in the years and decades to come, China would increasingly come to resemble its most radiant and dynamic city. The rest of the world was electrified by a sense of optimism that Hong Kong was a glimpse into China's future , not that Hong Kong would grow into a reflection of China's past. In every decision, I will continue to proudly defend and protect the workers, families, and citizens of the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you."}
{"SpeechID":"VSDT3052020141","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-05-30","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump at Kennedy Space Center","Type":"statement","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. Please. Please. Big day. This is a big day. And I want to thank our great Vice President for your fearless and tireless commitment to fulfilling America's destiny in space. Thank you very much, Mike. Great job. Great job. (Applause.)We're also grateful to Mike's wonderful wife, Karen, for being here and for all she does for our country. Thank you. Thank you, Karen. (Applause.) Before going further on this exciting day for all America in space, I want to say a few words about the situation in Minnesota. The death of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis was a grave tragedy. It should never have happened. It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger, and grief. Yesterday, I spoke to George's family and expressed the sorrow of our entire nation for their loss. I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace. And I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack, and menace. Healing, not hatred; justice, not chaos are the mission at hand. (Applause.) The police officers involved in this incident have been fired from their jobs. One officer has already been arrested and charged with murder. State and federal authorities are carrying out an investigation to see what further charges may be warranted, including against, sadly, the other three. In addition, my administration has opened a civil rights investigation, and I have asked the Attorney General and the Justice Department to expedite it. I understand the pain that people are feeling. We support the right of peaceful protesters, and we hear their pleas. But what we are now seeing on the streets of our cities has nothing to do with justice or with peace. The memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters, and anarchists. The violence and vandalism is being led by Antifa and other radical left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses, and burning down buildings. The main victims of this horrible, horrible situations are the citizens who live in these once lovely communities. The mobs are devastating the life's work of good people and destroying their dreams. Right now, America needs creation, not destruction; cooperation, not contempt; security, not anarchy. And there will be no anarchy. Civilization must be cherished, defended, and protected. The voices of law-abiding citizens must be heard, and heard very loudly. We cannot and must not allow a small group of criminals and vandals to wreck our cities and lay waste to our communities. We must defend the rights of every citizen to live without violence, prejudice, or fear. We support the overwhelming majority of police officers who are incredible in every way and devoted public servants. They keep our cities safe, protect our communities from gangs and drugs, and risk their own lives for us every day. No one is more upset than fellow law enforcement officers by the small handful who fail to abide by their oath to serve and protect. My administration will stop mob violence and will stop it cold. It does not serve the interests of justice or any citizen of any race, color, or creed for the government to give into anarchy, abandon police precincts, or allow communities to be burned to the ground. It won't happen. Those making excuses or justifications for violence are not helping the downtrodden, but delivering new anguish and new pain. From day one of my administration, we have made it a top priority to build up distressed communities and revitalize our crumbling inner cities. We fought hard with Senator Tim Scott and many others to create Opportunity Zones, helping to draw a surge of new investment to the places in our country that need it most. We must all work together as a society to expand opportunity and to create a future of greater dignity and promise for all of our people. We must forge a partnership with community leaders, local law enforcement, and the faith community to restore hope. Radical-left criminals, thugs, and others all throughout our country and throughout the world will not be allowed to set communities ablaze. We won't let it happen. It harms those who have the least. And we will be protecting those who have the least. The leadership of the National Guard and the Department of Justice are now in close communication with state and city officials in Minnesota. And we're coordinating our efforts with local law enforcement all across our nation. In America, justice is never achieved at the hands of an angry mob. I will not allow angry mobs to dominate. It won't happen. It is essential that we protect the crown jewel of American democracy: the rule of law and our independent system of justice. Every citizen in every community has the right to be safe in their workplace, safe in their homes, and safe in our city streets. This is the sacred right of all Americans that I am totally determined to defend and will defend. My administration will always stand against violence, mayhem, and disorder. We will stand with the family of George Floyd with the peaceful protesters and with every law-abiding citizen who wants decency, civility, safety, and security. We are working toward a more just society, but that means building up, not tearing down; joining hands, not hurling fists; standing in solidarity, not surrendering to hostility. Moments ago, as we witnessed the launch of two great American astronauts into space, we were filled with the sense of pride and unity that brings us together as Americans. That same spirit which powered our astronauts to the Moon has also helped lift our country to ever greater heights of justice and opportunity throughout our history. So today, as we mark a renewed commitment to America's future in space, a tremendous commitment it is. Let us also commit to a brighter future for all of our citizens right here on Earth. When Americans are united, there is nothing we cannot do. From day one of my administration, we put America first. (Applause.) This afternoon, I'm delighted to be with you at Cape Canaveral, in this storied home of American daring, aspiration, and drive. This is the first big space message in 50 years. Think of that. And it is an honor to be delivering it. Today, as we gather in this special place to celebrate not only the launch of a new spacecraft but also our nation's bold and triumphant return to the stars, it's a special day. Moments ago, the world bore witness to the flight of the first new manned U.S. spacecraft in nearly 40 years since the Space Shuttle launched in 1981 , a long time ago. I am thrilled to announce that the SpaceX Dragon Capsule has successfully reached low-Earth orbit and that our astronauts are safe and sound. (Applause.) With this launch, the decades of lost years and little action are officially over. A new age of American ambition has now begun.Past leaders put the United States at the mercy of foreign nations to send our astronauts into orbit. Not anymore. Today, we once again proudly launch American astronauts on American rockets, the best in the world, from right here on American soil. (Applause.) Those of us who saw the spectacular and unforgettable liftoff this afternoon watched more than an act of history; we watched an act of heroism. Every time our astronauts climb aboard a rocket , which is many, many stories of only engine and fuel , and vault across the sky, they display breathtaking valor.What Colonel Douglas Hurley and Colonel Robert Behnken did this afternoon was pure American genius and courage. They join the ranks of just seven prior American astronauts who have made the perilous maiden voyage to test a new class of spacecraft. The names of Hurley and Behnken will stand in the history books alongside those of legends like Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, John Young. Now these brave and selfless astronauts will continue their mission to advance the cause of human knowledge as they proceed to the International Space Station before returning to Earth. We wish them Godspeed on their journey, and as one proud nation, we salute their fearless service. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. I also want to send our nation's gratitude to the wives of these valiant astronauts, both of whom are astronauts themselves: Karen Nyberg and Megan McArthur. We join them in praying for our heroes' safe return. As you know, this spring, our nation has endured the pain and hardship of a global pandemic. As we usher in a new era of manned spaceflight, we are reminded that America is always in the process of transcending great challenges. Our nation is blessed with limitless reserves of talent, tenacity, and resolve. The same spirit of American determination that sends our people into space will conquer this disease on Earth. It should've never happened. Nothing , not even gravity itself , can hold Americans down or keep America back. We are grateful to NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and Director of the Kennedy Space Center Bob Cabana for welcoming us this evening. Very special. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Great job. Great job. Come a long way in three and a half years, Jim, haven't we? Huh? A long way. To the incredible men and women of NASA, from here at Kennedy Space Center, to the Johnson Space Center in Texas , we love you too , to NASA Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, Ohio: Thank you all for working so hard to make this day a reality. We have many other great days almost ready to happen. Also with us are many members of my Cabinet, including our great new DNI, John Ratcliffe. Thank you, John. Thank you. (Applause.) We have a great friend of mine, a special man, ran a great, great campaign: Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis. (Applause.) Thank you, Ron. Thank you, Ron. Your Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Leader Kevin McCarthy. Kevin, thank you very much. (Applause.) Great job you do, Kevin. And Representatives Matt Gaetz, John Rutherford, Michael Waltz, Bill Posey, Gus Bilirakis, Daniel Webster, Brian Mast, Elise Stefanik, Bill Flores, Brian Babin, Rodney Davis, Roger Marshall, and Steven Palazzo. Thank you very much, fellas. Thank you. (Applause.) What a great group of people. They're warriors. They're really warriors. They helped so much get this done, and so many other things. With us also is our Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Goldfein. General, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, General. Thank you. And Chief of Space Operations , the first-ever named , and now a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, because we created the United States Space Force , General Jay Raymond. Thank you very much. Jay. (Applause.) Thank you, Jay. And senior members, also, of our great United States military. It's never been stronger than it is right now. Also, Attorney General of Florida, Ashley Moody, and Chief Financial Officer of Florida, Jim Patronis, and many other distinguished guests. Thank you very much for being here. (Applause.) We appreciate it. I especially want to congratulate someone who truly embodies the American ethos of big thinking and risk-taking. After achieving success as an Internet entrepreneur, he could have spent his fortune doing anything, including yachting, lots of things. He could do lots of things. But in 2002, he began pouring tens of millions of dollars of his own money into research and development for a new rocket. He's a little different than a lot of other people. He likes rockets. He assembled a crew of some of the greatest minds and talent in American aerospace. In the years since, SpaceX has become the first private company to develop and successfully launch its own rocket into orbit, the first to launch and recover its own capsule, and of course, moments ago, Space X became the first private company to put humans into orbit around the Earth. Elon Musk, congratulations. Congratulations, Elon. (Applause.) Thanks, Elon.For Elon and 8,000 SpaceX employees, today is the fulfillment of a dream almost two decades in the making. For years on end, they have worked hand-in-hand with NASA, sculpting aluminum, tightening valves, tuning nozzles, testing parachutes, and filling massive tanks with thousands and thousands of pounds of kerosene and liquid oxygen. Today, the groundbreaking partnership between NASA and SpaceX has given our nation the gift of an unmatched power: a state-of-the art spaceship to put our astronauts into orbit at a fraction of the cost of the Space Shuttle. And it's much better. From now on, the United States will leverage the fast-growing capabilities of our commercial sector and the finest pieces of real estate on Earth , which you need very badly , to send U.S. astronauts into space. Under NASA's Commercial Crew program, we will use rockets and spacecraft designed, built, owned, and launched by private American companies, at a fixed price for the American taxpayer. Today's launch makes clear the commercial space industry is the future. The modern world was built by risk-takers and renegades, fierce competitors, skilled craftsmen, captains of industry who pursued opportunities no one else saw and envisioned what no one else could ever think of seeing. The United States will harness the unrivaled creativity and speed of our private sector to stride ever further into the unknown. This launch also marks an exciting turning point for NASA. This agency will now focus its unmatched ex- , expertise, like nobody has ever seen, and power and integrity to do what NASA does better than anyone else , and it's not even close: embark on the most difficult, most daring, most audacious missions in the history of humankind. When I first came into office three and a half years ago, NASA had lost its way, and the excitement, energy, and ambition, as almost everybody in this room knows, was gone. There was grass growing through the cracks of your concrete runways. Not a pretty sight. Not a pretty sight at all. The last administration presided over the closing of the Space Shuttle and almost all of the giant facility that keeps so many people working, so many brilliant minds going. People were crying. They were devastated. But now it's the greatest of its kind anywhere in the world and will get greater and greater with years to come. I promise you that. (Applause.) We have created the envy of the world and will soon be landing on Mars, and will soon have the greatest weapons ever imagined in history. I've already seen designs. And even I can't believe it. The United States has regained our place of prestige as the world leader. As has often been stated, you can't be number one on Earth if you are number two in space. (Applause.) And we are not going to be number two anywhere. (Applause.)Nowhere is this more true than with our military, which we have completely rebuilt. Under my administration, we have invested two and a half trillion dollars in new planes, ships, submarines, tanks, missiles, rockets , anything you can think of. And last year, I signed the law creating the sixth branch of that already very famous United States Armed Forces: the Space Force. (Applause.) For every citizen who has eagerly waited for America to reignite those engines of will, confidence, and imagination that put a man on the Moon, I stand before you to say: You need wait no longer. Through NASA's Artemis program, the United States is preparing for a crewed mission to Mars. Earlier this week, I saw the Orion capsules being worked on in this building. As part of the Artemis Moon-to-Mars program, those capsules will soon return Americans to lunar orbit for the first time in over 50 years , half a century. By 2024, our astronauts will return to the lunar surface to establish a permanent presence and the launching pad to Mars. (Applause.) And the first woman on the moon will be an American woman. And the first nation to land on Mars will be the United States of America. (Applause.) Since I signed the order to establish these goals shortly after taking office, we have made rapid gains. A new 22,000- pound capsule is already built. The next generation of space suits are already made. Colossal rockets are now being tested. And the contracts for three separate lunar landers have been awarded and signed, and they are magnificent. In the years ahead, America will go bigger, bolder, further, faster, and America will go first. America will always be first. (Applause.) To be certain, we will meet the adversity and hardship along the way. There may even be tragedy, because that is the danger of space. There's nothing we can do about that. The power that we're talking about is unrivaled. There's nothing we can do about problems. But we'll have very few of them. We will confront all of those challenges, knowing that the quest for understanding is the oldest and deepest hope in our souls. The innate human desire to explore and innovate is what propels the engines of progress and the march of civilization. We will preserve and persevere, and we will ensure a future of American dominance in space. To that end, over the last three years, I reestablished the National Space Council. I issued a directive cutting red tape for innovative space companies such as SpaceX. We created the world's first comprehensive space traffic management system. Last month, I signed an executive order establishing U.S. policy for the recovery and use of space resources and minerals. Administrator Bridenstine announced the Artemis Accords to govern the future of space exploration and development. Together, we will assert America's rightful heritage as the greatest space-faring nation on the planet. And already, it's not even close. In the half a century since the United States stopped sending astronauts to deep into space , 1972 , no other country has ever done it. The reasons are simple: cost, technological complexity, and tremendous danger. For instance, I was told that the rocket you just witnessed had to be launched within one second, or it would be impossible for it to hit its target. And I was here two days ago, and I said to Jim: \"Jim, it's okay. Why don't you wait 5 or 10 minutes?\" (Laughter.) And he said, \"Sir, we only have a window of one second.\" And I walked out of here shaking my head. (Laughter.) Is that true, Jim? Yes, it true. Space travel is not a feat of engineering alone. It's also a moral endeavor , a measure of a nation's vision, its willpower, its place in the world. Exploration is a test of our values and of our faith. America is a nation defined by its commitment to discovery , to solve mysteries, to chart the unknown, to press the limits, to achieve the fullest expression of life's potential, and to ensure that America is the nation that always leads the way, and especially in space. This evening, I am more confident than ever before that America stands poised to thrive in this grand undertaking. It's incredible. We are a nation of pioneers. We are the people who crossed the ocean, carved out a foothold on a vast continent, settled a great wilderness, and then set our eyes upon the stars. This is our history, and this is our destiny. Now, like our ancestors before us, we are venturing out to explore a new, magnificent frontier. It's called: space. Our most daring feats, our most epic journeys, our biggest adventures, and our finest days are just beginning. America's proudest moments are still ahead. We are on the verge of our most exciting years, and next year may be the most exciting of all. You just watch.So today, as our brave American astronauts shake the Earth and blaze a trail of fire and steel into the heavens, we proclaim for all to hear that we have not yet tested the full strength of the American character, and the world has not yet seen the full glory of the American spirit. For our country, for our children, and for humanity's march into the stars, the best is yet to come. (Applause.) It was a great honor for me to deliver this speech. God bless our brave astronauts now soaring through the heavens. God bless the men and women of NASA. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) END 5:49 P.M.

We have created the envy of the world and will soon be landing on Mars, and will soon have the greatest weapons ever imagined in history. I've already seen designs. And even I can't believe it. The United States has regained our place of prestige as the world leader. As has often been stated, you can't be number one on Earth if you are number two in space. (Applause.) And we are not going to be number two anywhere. (Applause.)Nowhere is this more true than with our military, which we have completely rebuilt. Under my administration, we have invested two and a half trillion dollars in new planes, ships, submarines, tanks, missiles, rockets , anything you can think of. And last year, I signed the law creating the sixth branch of that already very famous United States Armed Forces: the Space Force. (Applause.) For every citizen who has eagerly waited for America to reignite those engines of will, confidence, and imagination that put a man on the Moon, I stand before you to say: You need wait no longer. Through NASA's Artemis program, the United States is preparing for a crewed mission to Mars. Earlier this week, I saw the Orion capsules being worked on in this building. As part of the Artemis Moon-to-Mars program, those capsules will soon return Americans to lunar orbit for the first time in over 50 years , half a century. By 2024, our astronauts will return to the lunar surface to establish a permanent presence and the launching pad to Mars. (Applause.) And the first woman on the moon will be an American woman. And the first nation to land on Mars will be the United States of America. (Applause.) Since I signed the order to establish these goals shortly after taking office, we have made rapid gains. A new 22,000- pound capsule is already built. The next generation of space suits are already made. Colossal rockets are now being tested. And the contracts for three separate lunar landers have been awarded and signed, and they are magnificent. In the years ahead, America will go bigger, bolder, further, faster, and America will go first. America will always be first. (Applause.) To be certain, we will meet the adversity and hardship along the way. There may even be tragedy, because that is the danger of space. There's nothing we can do about that. The power that we're talking about is unrivaled. There's nothing we can do about problems. But we'll have very few of them. We will confront all of those challenges, knowing that the quest for understanding is the oldest and deepest hope in our souls. The innate human desire to explore and innovate is what propels the engines of progress and the march of civilization. We will preserve and persevere, and we will ensure a future of American dominance in space. To that end, over the last three years, I reestablished the National Space Council. I issued a directive cutting red tape for innovative space companies such as SpaceX. We created the world's first comprehensive space traffic management system. Last month, I signed an executive order establishing U.S. policy for the recovery and use of space resources and minerals. Administrator Bridenstine announced the Artemis Accords to govern the future of space exploration and development. Together, we will assert America's rightful heritage as the greatest space-faring nation on the planet. And already, it's not even close. In the half a century since the United States stopped sending astronauts to deep into space , 1972 , no other country has ever done it. The reasons are simple: cost, technological complexity, and tremendous danger. For instance, I was told that the rocket you just witnessed had to be launched within one second, or it would be impossible for it to hit its target. And I was here two days ago, and I said to Jim: 'Jim, it's okay. Why don't you wait 5 or 10 minutes?' (Laughter.) And he said, 'Sir, we only have a window of one second.' And I walked out of here shaking my head. (Laughter.) Is that true, Jim? Yes, it true. Space travel is not a feat of engineering alone. It's also a moral endeavor , a measure of a nation's vision, its willpower, its place in the world. Exploration is a test of our values and of our faith. America is a nation defined by its commitment to discovery , to solve mysteries, to chart the unknown, to press the limits, to achieve the fullest expression of life's potential, and to ensure that America is the nation that always leads the way, and especially in space. This evening, I am more confident than ever before that America stands poised to thrive in this grand undertaking. It's incredible. We are a nation of pioneers. We are the people who crossed the ocean, carved out a foothold on a vast continent, settled a great wilderness, and then set our eyes upon the stars. This is our history, and this is our destiny. Now, like our ancestors before us, we are venturing out to explore a new, magnificent frontier. It's called: space. Our most daring feats, our most epic journeys, our biggest adventures, and our finest days are just beginning. America's proudest moments are still ahead. We are on the verge of our most exciting years, and next year may be the most exciting of all. You just watch.So today, as our brave American astronauts shake the Earth and blaze a trail of fire and steel into the heavens, we proclaim for all to hear that we have not yet tested the full strength of the American character, and the world has not yet seen the full glory of the American spirit. For our country, for our children, and for humanity's march into the stars, the best is yet to come. (Applause.) It was a great honor for me to deliver this speech. God bless our brave astronauts now soaring through the heavens. God bless the men and women of NASA. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)"}

My fellow Americans: My first and highest duty as President is to defend our great country and the American people. I swore an oath to uphold the laws of our nation, and that is exactly what I will do. All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that, for George and his family, justice will be served. He will not have died in vain. But we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drowned out by an angry mob. The biggest victims of the rioting are peace-loving citizens in our poorest communities, and as their President, I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you. I am your President of law and order, and an ally of all peaceful protesters. But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, Antifa, and others. A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents. Innocent people have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street, or the woman in Upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small-business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed. New York's Finest have been hit in the face with bricks. Brave nurses, who have battled the virus, are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct station has been overrun. Here in the nation's capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War Two Memorial have been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set ablaze. A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed. These are not acts of peaceful protest. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God. America needs creation, not destruction; cooperation, not contempt; security, not anarchy; healing, not hatred; justice, not chaos. This is our mission, and we will succeed. One hundred percent, we will succeed. Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America. I am mobilizing all available federal resources , civilian and military , to stop the rioting and looting, to end the destruction and arson, and to protect the rights of law-abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights. Therefore, the following measures are going into effect immediately: First, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now. Today, I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets. Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington, D.C. What happened in this city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property. We are putting everybody on warning: Our seven o'clock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested, detained, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organizers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail. This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. One law and order , and that is what it is: one law. We have one beautiful law. And once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you, we will help your business, and we will help your family. America is founded upon the rule of law. It is the foundation of our prosperity, our freedom, and our very way of life. But where there is no law, there is no opportunity. Where there is no justice, there is no liberty. Where there is no safety, there is no future. We must never give in to anger or hatred. If malice or violence reigns, then none of us is free. I take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country. By far, our greatest days lie ahead. Thank you very much. And now I'm going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much. END 6:50 P.M.

On behalf of our entire nation, let me say congratulations to the incredible West Point Class of 2020. Congratulations. Everyone have a good time, enjoy yourselves, because we are here to celebrate your achievements, and great achievements they are. Let us also recognize your remarkable Superintendent, General Darryl Williams, for his outstanding stewardship. General, thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. (Applause.) Few words in the English language and few places in history have commanded as much awe and admiration as West Point. This premier military academy produces only the best of the best, the strongest of the strong, and the bravest of the brave. West Point is a universal symbol of American gallantry, loyalty, devotion, discipline, and great skill. There is no place on Earth I would rather be than right here with all of you. It's a great honor. Across this hallowed plain have passed many of the greatest and most fearsome soldiers that ever lived. They were heroes who drove thundering columns of Sherman tanks into the heart of a wicked empire. They were legends who unleashed the fury of American artillery upon our enemies on remote islands and distant shores. They were titans who strode through cannon blast and cavalry charge, and stared down our foes through gray clouds of smoke and shrapnel. They were the Army Rangers who led the way up jagged cliffs, the Airborne soldiers who rained down justice in the dark of night, the infantry whose very sight meant liberation was near, and the mighty forces who sent tyrants, terrorists, and sadistic monsters running scared through the gates of hell. No evil force on Earth can match the noble power and righteous glory of the American warrior. I have no doubt that the young men and women before me today will add your names to this eternal chronicle of American heroes. You will go forth from this place adored by your countrymen, dreaded by your enemies, and respected by all throughout the world. Someday, generations of future West Point cadets will study your legacy. They will know your deeds, they will celebrate your triumphs, and they will proudly follow your example. To the 1,107 who today become the newest officers in the most exceptional Army ever to take the field of battle, I am here to offer America's salute. Thank you for answering your nation's call. On this special occasion, we are delighted to be joined by Congressman Steve Womack, Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy, Assistant Secretary Casey Wardynski, and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville, an old grad from the class of 1981. Let's also express our appreciation to General Curtis Buzzard, General Cindy Jebb, and all of the wonderful instructors, coaches, and faculty members who are continuing West Point's two-century tradition of unrivaled excellence. To all of the parents, grandparents, and family members watching this ceremony from your beautiful home: Even though you could not be here today, we know this day could never have happened without you. Your love and sacrifice have given America these phenomenal men and women. Cadets, please join me in sending your parents and families the heartfelt thanks that they so richly deserved. They're all watching right now. Please. (Applause.) Thank you very much. The depth and breadth of the U.S. Military's contributions to our society are an everlasting inspiration to us all. I want to take this opportunity to thank all members of America's Armed Forces in every branch , active duty, National Guard, and reserve , who stepped forward to help battle the invisible enemy , the new virus that came to our shores from a distant land called China. We will vanquish the virus. We will extinguish this plague. I also want to thank the men and women of our National Guard who respond with precision to so many recent challenges, from hurricanes and natural disasters, to ensuring peace, safety, and the constitutional rule of law on our streets. We thank every citizen who wears a uniform in selfless service to our nation. The members of this class have come from every state in our union. You have come from the farms and the cities, from states big and small, and from every race, religion, color, and creed. But when you entered these grounds, you became part of one team, one family, proudly serving one great American nation. You became brothers and sisters pledging allegiance to the same timeless principles, joined together in a common mission to protect our country, to defend our people, and to carry on the traditions of freedom, equality, and liberty that so many gave their lives to secure. You exemplify the power of shared national purpose to transcend all differences and achieve true unity. Today, you graduate as one class, and you embody one noble creed: Duty, Honor, Country. Every graduate on this field could have gone to virtually any top-ranked university that you wanted. You chose to devote your life to the defense of America. You came to West Point because you know the truth: America is the greatest country in human history, and the United States Military is the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known. The survival of America and the endurance of civilization itself depends on the men and women just like each of you. It depends on people who love their country with all their heart and energy and soul. It depends on citizens who build, sustain, nurture, and defend institutions like this one; that is how societies are made and how progress is advanced. What has historically made America unique is the durability of its institutions against the passions and prejudices of the moment. When times are turbulent, when the road is rough, what matters most is that which is permanent, timeless, enduring, and eternal. It was on this soil that American patriots held the most vital fortress in our war for independence. It was this school that gave us the men who fought and won a bloody war to extinguish the evil of slavery within one lifetime of our founding. It was the graduates of West Point , towering figures like McArthur, Patton, Eisenhower, and Bradley , who led America to victory over the sinister Nazis and imperial fascists 75 years ago. It was under the leadership of West Point graduates like the legendary General Matthew Ridgway that the Army was at the forefront of ending the terrible injustice of segregation. It was Army strength that held the line against the brutal opposition and oppression from Communism. And it has been thanks to patriots like you that America has climbed to new heights of human achievement and national endeavor. This is your history. This is the legacy that each of you inherits. It is the legacy purchased with American blood at the crest of Little Round Top, on the crimson beaches of Normandy, in the freezing mud of Bastogne, and the dense jungles of Vietnam. It is the legacy of courageous, selfless, faithful patriots who fought for every inch of dirt with every ounce of strength and every last scrap of heart and drive and grit they had. And they did it because they believed in the undying principles of our founding. They did it because they cherished their homes, their faith, their family, and their flag. And they did it because when they came to this school, they were taught to hold fast to their love of our country; to cherish our heritage, learn from it, and build upon it. That is what young Americans are taught here at West Point. That is the legacy that you carry forward as second lieutenants in the United States Army, and you must never forget it. Through four long years, you have honed your skills, trained your mind and body, overcome every obstacle, and earned your place of pride in the Long Gray Line. You made it through the rigors of R-Day and Beast, the intensity of CLDT, and weeks of training in the blistering heat. You have pushed yourselves far beyond every limit imaginable. Some of you have even pushed the limits a bit too much. So for any cadets who have not finished walking off their hours, as Commander-in-Chief, I hereby absolve all cadets on restriction for minor conduct offenses, and that is effective immediately. Congratulations. (Applause.) That's a nice one, isn't it? Don't you feel better now? (Laughter.) Surviving the 47-month experience is never easy, but only the class of 2020 can say it survived 48 months. And when it comes to bragging rights, no one can boast louder than the class that brought Navy's 14-year football winning streak to a screeching halt. You did that. I happened to be there. (Applause.) I happened to be there. That's right. That was a big day. I was there. You beat Navy and brought the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy back to West Point for two straight years. So we say, \"Go, Army, go.\" This graduating class secured more than 1,000 victories for the Black Knights, including three bowl victories, 13 NCAA team appearances, and a Women's Rugby Championship with the help of somebody that I just met: 2019 MVP, Sam Sullivan. Fantastic job. Thank you. A fantastic job. (Applause.) Five cadets won national boxing championships, and Adaya Queen brought home two. Brendan Brown earned the title of Powerlifting National Champion. In academics, 38 cadets have earned fellowships to continue their studies, including First Captain Dane Van de Wall, who received one of the most prestigious awards in academia: the Rhodes Scholarship. Congratulations, Dane. It's a great achievement. Thank you. Congratulations. (Applause.) Great achievement. But no one modeled the values of the soldier-scholar quite like Lindy Mooradian. Lindy earned both the highest overall class standing and the highest physical program score. She has published scientific research in a prominent journal and set five new records on the athletic track. Lindy, incredible job. Where is Lindy? Where is Lindy? (Applause.) For somebody that did so well, they didn't give you a very good seat, Lindy. (Laughter.) We have to talk about that. Congratulations. Right now, America needs a class of cadets that lives by your motto: \"With Vision, We Lead.\" We need you to carry on the spirit of the great General Ulysses S. Grant. Soon after assuming overall command, following three years of Union setbacks, General Grant encountered someone heading north to Washington during the Battle of the Wilderness: \"If you see the President,\" Grant said, \"tell him from me that whatever happens, there will [never] be no turning back.\" We need you to be as visionary as Patton, who as a young man in 1917, became the first soldier assigned to the Army Tank Corps. One month into the job, he saw the future, writing, \"If resistance is broken, and the line pierced, the tank must and will assume the role of pursuit cavalry and ride the enemy to death.\" Under Patton's leadership, that's exactly what they did. We need you to be as bold and determined as the immortal General Douglas MacArthur, who knew that the American soldier never, ever quits. After leaving the Philippines for Australia at a low point of the Pacific War in 1942, MacArthur famously vowed, \"I shall return.\" For two years, he then took great strategic risks and placed himself often in personal danger. On October 20th, 1944, McArthur stepped off a landing boat, strode through knee-high water, and proclaimed, \"People of the Philippines: I have returned. By the grace of Almighty God, our forces stand again on Philippine soil.\" He then called upon the islands' brave people to rise up and join the fight. America's momentum was unstoppable. These great leaders were not afraid of what others might say about them. They didn't care. They knew their duty was to protect their country. They knew the Army exists to preserve the republic and the strong foundations upon which it stands: family, God, country, liberty, and justice. They were true, tough American patriots. That is what our country needs, especially in these times, and that is what you are. Each of you begins your career in the Army at a crucial moment in American history. We are restoring the fundamental principles that the job of the American soldier is not to rebuild foreign nations, but defend , and defend strongly , our nation from foreign enemies. We are ending the era of endless wars. In its place is a renewed, clear-eyed focus on defending America's vital interests. It is not the duty of U.S. troops to solve ancient conflicts in faraway lands that many people have never even heard of. We are not the policemen of the world. But let our enemies be on notice: If our people are threatened, we will never, ever hesitate to act. And when we fight, from now on, we will fight only to win. As MacArthur said: \"In war, there is no substitute for victory.\" To ensure you have the very best equipment and technology available, my administration has embarked on a colossal rebuilding of the American Armed Forces, a record like no other. After years of devastating budget cuts and a military that was totally depleted from these endless wars, we have invested over 2 trillion , trillion; that's with a \"T\" , dollars in the most powerful fighting force, by far, on the planet Earth. We are building new ships, bombers, jet fighters, and helicopters by the hundreds; new tanks, military satellites, rockets, and missiles; even a hypersonic missile that goes 17 times faster than the fastest missile currently available in the world and can hit a target 1,000 miles away within 14 inches from center point. For the first time in 70 years, we established a new branch of the United States military: the Space Force. It's a big deal. In recent years, America's warriors have made clear to all the high cost of threatening the American people. The savage ISIS caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed under the Trump administration, and its barbaric leader, al-Baghdadi, is gone, killed, over. And the world's number-one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, is likewise dead. As Commander-in-Chief, I never forget for one instant the immense sacrifices we ask of those who wear this nation's uniform. Already, you have known the crushing pain of losing a brother in arms. Today, we remember an extraordinary cadet who made the supreme sacrifice in an accident last year: C.J. Morgan. We are deeply moved to be joined by his father, Christopher Morgan. And C.J. was something very special. Christopher is a Secret Service Agent. A tough guy. Great guy. Great son, who is looking down right now. Christopher, I want you to know that we will carry C.J.'s blessed memory in our hearts forever. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Tomorrow, America will celebrate a very important anniversary: the 245th birthday of the United States Army. Unrelated, going to be my birthday also. (Laughter.) I don't know if that happened by accident. Did that happen by accident, please? But it's a great day because of that Army birthday. And as you know, the Army's first Commander-in-Chief, General George Washington, called the fort that stood on this majestic point \"the most important post in America.\" Its strategic location on the Hudson River was vital to our war for independence. If British ships gained control of this river, they would have divided our young nation in two. So American soldiers stretched a massive metal chain across the waters of the Hudson, from West Point all the way to Constitution Island. I saw a piece of that chain. It's incredible. No enemy ship even dared try to cross. Every link in that great chain was formed from over 100 pounds of pure American iron, mined from American soil, and made with American pride. Together, those links formed an unbreakable line of defense. Standing here before you more than two centuries later, it is clearer than ever that General Washington's words still hold true. West Point is still the indispensable post for America, the vital ground that must not lose. And the survival of our nation still depends on a great chain reaching out from this place , one made not of iron, but of flesh and blood, of memory and spirit, of sheer faith and unyielding courage. Today, each of you becomes another link in that unbroken chain, forged in the crucible known as the United States Military Academy, the greatest on Earth. It has given you soldiers that you can rely on to your right and to your left. And now we are entrusting you with the most noble task any warrior has ever had the privilege to carry out: the task of preserving American liberty. As long as you remain loyal, faithful, and true, then our enemies don't even stand a chance, our rights will never be stolen, our freedoms will never be trampled, our destiny will never be denied, and the United States of America will never be defeated. With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail. Nothing will stand in your way, nothing will slow you down, and nothing will stop the West Point Class of 2020 from achieving a true and lasting victory. God bless you. God bless the United States Army. And God bless America. Congratulations. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Everyone have a good time, enjoy yourselves, because we are here to celebrate your achievements, and great achievements they are. Let us also recognize your remarkable Superintendent, General Darryl Williams, for his outstanding stewardship. General, thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. (Applause.) Few words in the English language and few places in history have commanded as much awe and admiration as West Point. This premier military academy produces only the best of the best, the strongest of the strong, and the bravest of the brave. West Point is a universal symbol of American gallantry, loyalty, devotion, discipline, and great skill. There is no place on Earth I would rather be than right here with all of you. It's a great honor. Across this hallowed plain have passed many of the greatest and most fearsome soldiers that ever lived. They were heroes who drove thundering columns of Sherman tanks into the heart of a wicked empire. They were legends who unleashed the fury of American artillery upon our enemies on remote islands and distant shores. They were titans who strode through cannon blast and cavalry charge, and stared down our foes through gray clouds of smoke and shrapnel. They were the Army Rangers who led the way up jagged cliffs, the Airborne soldiers who rained down justice in the dark of night, the infantry whose very sight meant liberation was near, and the mighty forces who sent tyrants, terrorists, and sadistic monsters running scared through the gates of hell. No evil force on Earth can match the noble power and righteous glory of the American warrior. I have no doubt that the young men and women before me today will add your names to this eternal chronicle of American heroes. You will go forth from this place adored by your countrymen, dreaded by your enemies, and respected by all throughout the world. Someday, generations of future West Point cadets will study your legacy. They will know your deeds, they will celebrate your triumphs, and they will proudly follow your example. To the 1,107 who today become the newest officers in the most exceptional Army ever to take the field of battle, I am here to offer America's salute. Thank you for answering your nation's call. On this special occasion, we are delighted to be joined by Congressman Steve Womack, Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy, Assistant Secretary Casey Wardynski, and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville, an old grad from the class of 1981. Let's also express our appreciation to General Curtis Buzzard, General Cindy Jebb, and all of the wonderful instructors, coaches, and faculty members who are continuing West Point's two-century tradition of unrivaled excellence. To all of the parents, grandparents, and family members watching this ceremony from your beautiful home: Even though you could not be here today, we know this day could never have happened without you. Your love and sacrifice have given America these phenomenal men and women. Cadets, please join me in sending your parents and families the heartfelt thanks that they so richly deserved. They're all watching right now. Please. (Applause.) Thank you very much. The depth and breadth of the U.S. Military's contributions to our society are an everlasting inspiration to us all. I want to take this opportunity to thank all members of America's Armed Forces in every branch , active duty, National Guard, and reserve , who stepped forward to help battle the invisible enemy , the new virus that came to our shores from a distant land called China. We will vanquish the virus. We will extinguish this plague. I also want to thank the men and women of our National Guard who respond with precision to so many recent challenges, from hurricanes and natural disasters, to ensuring peace, safety, and the constitutional rule of law on our streets. We thank every citizen who wears a uniform in selfless service to our nation. The members of this class have come from every state in our union. You have come from the farms and the cities, from states big and small, and from every race, religion, color, and creed. But when you entered these grounds, you became part of one team, one family, proudly serving one great American nation. You became brothers and sisters pledging allegiance to the same timeless principles, joined together in a common mission to protect our country, to defend our people, and to carry on the traditions of freedom, equality, and liberty that so many gave their lives to secure. You exemplify the power of shared national purpose to transcend all differences and achieve true unity. Today, you graduate as one class, and you embody one noble creed: Duty, Honor, Country. Every graduate on this field could have gone to virtually any top-ranked university that you wanted. You chose to devote your life to the defense of America. You came to West Point because you know the truth: America is the greatest country in human history, and the United States Military is the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known. The survival of America and the endurance of civilization itself depends on the men and women just like each of you. It depends on people who love their country with all their heart and energy and soul. It depends on citizens who build, sustain, nurture, and defend institutions like this one; that is how societies are made and how progress is advanced. What has historically made America unique is the durability of its institutions against the passions and prejudices of the moment. When times are turbulent, when the road is rough, what matters most is that which is permanent, timeless, enduring, and eternal. It was on this soil that American patriots held the most vital fortress in our war for independence. It was this school that gave us the men who fought and won a bloody war to extinguish the evil of slavery within one lifetime of our founding. It was the graduates of West Point , towering figures like McArthur, Patton, Eisenhower, and Bradley , who led America to victory over the sinister Nazis and imperial fascists 75 years ago. It was under the leadership of West Point graduates like the legendary General Matthew Ridgway that the Army was at the forefront of ending the terrible injustice of segregation. It was Army strength that held the line against the brutal opposition and oppression from Communism. And it has been thanks to patriots like you that America has climbed to new heights of human achievement and national endeavor. This is your history. This is the legacy that each of you inherits. It is the legacy purchased with American blood at the crest of Little Round Top, on the crimson beaches of Normandy, in the freezing mud of Bastogne, and the dense jungles of Vietnam. It is the legacy of courageous, selfless, faithful patriots who fought for every inch of dirt with every ounce of strength and every last scrap of heart and drive and grit they had. And they did it because they believed in the undying principles of our founding. They did it because they cherished their homes, their faith, their family, and their flag. And they did it because when they came to this school, they were taught to hold fast to their love of our country; to cherish our heritage, learn from it, and build upon it. That is what young Americans are taught here at West Point. That is the legacy that you carry forward as second lieutenants in the United States Army, and you must never forget it. Through four long years, you have honed your skills, trained your mind and body, overcome every obstacle, and earned your place of pride in the Long Gray Line. You made it through the rigors of R-Day and Beast, the intensity of CLDT, and weeks of training in the blistering heat. You have pushed yourselves far beyond every limit imaginable. Some of you have even pushed the limits a bit too much. So for any cadets who have not finished walking off their hours, as Commander-in-Chief, I hereby absolve all cadets on restriction for minor conduct offenses, and that is effective immediately. Congratulations. (Applause.) That's a nice one, isn't it? Don't you feel better now? (Laughter.) Surviving the 47-month experience is never easy, but only the class of 2020 can say it survived 48 months. And when it comes to bragging rights, no one can boast louder than the class that brought Navy's 14-year football winning streak to a screeching halt. You did that. I happened to be there. (Applause.) I happened to be there. That's right. That was a big day. I was there. You beat Navy and brought the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy back to West Point for two straight years. So we say, 'Go, Army, go.' This graduating class secured more than 1,000 victories for the Black Knights, including three bowl victories, 13 NCAA team appearances, and a Women's Rugby Championship with the help of somebody that I just met: 2019 MVP, Sam Sullivan. Fantastic job. Thank you. A fantastic job. (Applause.) Five cadets won national boxing championships, and Adaya Queen brought home two. Brendan Brown earned the title of Powerlifting National Champion. In academics, 38 cadets have earned fellowships to continue their studies, including First Captain Dane Van de Wall, who received one of the most prestigious awards in academia: the Rhodes Scholarship. Congratulations, Dane. It's a great achievement. Thank you. Congratulations. (Applause.) Great achievement. But no one modeled the values of the soldier-scholar quite like Lindy Mooradian. Lindy earned both the highest overall class standing and the highest physical program score. She has published scientific research in a prominent journal and set five new records on the athletic track. Lindy, incredible job. Where is Lindy? Where is Lindy? (Applause.) For somebody that did so well, they didn't give you a very good seat, Lindy. (Laughter.) We have to talk about that. Congratulations. Right now, America needs a class of cadets that lives by your motto: 'With Vision, We Lead.' We need you to carry on the spirit of the great General Ulysses S. Grant. Soon after assuming overall command, following three years of Union setbacks, General Grant encountered someone heading north to Washington during the Battle of the Wilderness: 'If you see the President,' Grant said, 'tell him from me that whatever happens, there will be no turning back.' We need you to be as visionary as Patton, who as a young man in 1917, became the first soldier assigned to the Army Tank Corps. One month into the job, he saw the future, writing, 'If resistance is broken, and the line pierced, the tank must and will assume the role of pursuit cavalry and ride the enemy to death.' Under Patton's leadership, that's exactly what they did. We need you to be as bold and determined as the immortal General Douglas MacArthur, who knew that the American soldier never, ever quits. After leaving the Philippines for Australia at a low point of the Pacific War in 1942, MacArthur famously vowed, 'I shall return.' For two years, he then took great strategic risks and placed himself often in personal danger. On October 20th, 1944, McArthur stepped off a landing boat, strode through knee-high water, and proclaimed, 'People of the Philippines: I have returned. By the grace of Almighty God, our forces stand again on Philippine soil.' He then called upon the islands' brave people to rise up and join the fight. America's momentum was unstoppable. These great leaders were not afraid of what others might say about them. They didn't care. They knew their duty was to protect their country. They knew the Army exists to preserve the republic and the strong foundations upon which it stands: family, God, country, liberty, and justice. They were true, tough American patriots. That is what our country needs, especially in these times, and that is what you are. Each of you begins your career in the Army at a crucial moment in American history. We are restoring the fundamental principles that the job of the American soldier is not to rebuild foreign nations, but defend , and defend strongly , our nation from foreign enemies. We are ending the era of endless wars. In its place is a renewed, clear-eyed focus on defending America's vital interests. It is not the duty of U.S. troops to solve ancient conflicts in faraway lands that many people have never even heard of. We are not the policemen of the world. But let our enemies be on notice: If our people are threatened, we will never, ever hesitate to act. And when we fight, from now on, we will fight only to win. As MacArthur said: 'In war, there is no substitute for victory.' To ensure you have the very best equipment and technology available, my administration has embarked on a colossal rebuilding of the American Armed Forces, a record like no other. After years of devastating budget cuts and a military that was totally depleted from these endless wars, we have invested over 2 trillion , trillion; that's with a 'T' , dollars in the most powerful fighting force, by far, on the planet Earth. We are building new ships, bombers, jet fighters, and helicopters by the hundreds; new tanks, military satellites, rockets, and missiles; even a hypersonic missile that goes 17 times faster than the fastest missile currently available in the world and can hit a target 1,000 miles away within 14 inches from center point. For the first time in 70 years, we established a new branch of the United States military: the Space Force. It's a big deal. In recent years, America's warriors have made clear to all the high cost of threatening the American people. The savage ISIS caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed under the Trump administration, and its barbaric leader, al-Baghdadi, is gone, killed, over. And the world's number-one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, is likewise dead. As Commander-in-Chief, I never forget for one instant the immense sacrifices we ask of those who wear this nation's uniform. Already, you have known the crushing pain of losing a brother in arms. Today, we remember an extraordinary cadet who made the supreme sacrifice in an accident last year: C.J. Morgan. We are deeply moved to be joined by his father, Christopher Morgan. And C.J. was something very special. Christopher is a Secret Service Agent. A tough guy. Great guy. Great son, who is looking down right now. Christopher, I want you to know that we will carry C.J.'s blessed memory in our hearts forever. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Tomorrow, America will celebrate a very important anniversary: the 245th birthday of the United States Army. Unrelated, going to be my birthday also. (Laughter.) I don't know if that happened by accident. Did that happen by accident, please? But it's a great day because of that Army birthday. And as you know, the Army's first Commander-in-Chief, General George Washington, called the fort that stood on this majestic point 'the most important post in America.' Its strategic location on the Hudson River was vital to our war for independence. If British ships gained control of this river, they would have divided our young nation in two. So American soldiers stretched a massive metal chain across the waters of the Hudson, from West Point all the way to Constitution Island. I saw a piece of that chain. It's incredible. No enemy ship even dared try to cross. Every link in that great chain was formed from over 100 pounds of pure American iron, mined from American soil, and made with American pride. Together, those links formed an unbreakable line of defense. Standing here before you more than two centuries later, it is clearer than ever that General Washington's words still hold true. West Point is still the indispensable post for America, the vital ground that must not lose. And the survival of our nation still depends on a great chain reaching out from this place , one made not of iron, but of flesh and blood, of memory and spirit, of sheer faith and unyielding courage. Today, each of you becomes another link in that unbroken chain, forged in the crucible known as the United States Military Academy, the greatest on Earth. It has given you soldiers that you can rely on to your right and to your left. And now we are entrusting you with the most noble task any warrior has ever had the privilege to carry out: the task of preserving American liberty. As long as you remain loyal, faithful, and true, then our enemies don't even stand a chance, our rights will never be stolen, our freedoms will never be trampled, our destiny will never be denied, and the United States of America will never be defeated. With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail. Nothing will stand in your way, nothing will slow you down, and nothing will stop the West Point Class of 2020 from achieving a true and lasting victory. God bless you. God bless the United States Army. And God bless America. Congratulations. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)"}

Thank you. Yeah, it's a good song, isn't it though? Lee Greenwood. And thank you very much. I'm thrilled to be here with you on this incredible summer day in Wisconsin on the edge of the beautiful Lake Michigan , that is beautiful too; I know it well , with the legendary workers of Marinette Marine. And you now have a lot of contracts because of the United States government. You're going to , you're going to be so busy. (Applause.) You're going to be so busy. I know you went through a little bit of a hard time; not anymore. Not anymore. Got you covered for years. For more than 75 years, the workers of this shipyard have built some 1,500 of the finest and most fearsome vessels ever to sail. You've kept our sailors safe and our Navy strong. Every single day you prove that American workers are the best in the world and now you're going to do things like you've never done before. Moments ago, I walked the length of the majestic freedom-class combat ship that many of you have been pouring your hearts and souls out for over a year. Soon, that ship will be commissioned into the most powerful fleet in human history. We're building up the Navy. We'll have 350 ships. It was actually down to a level which was , World War One , that's a long time ago, isn't it? World War One. We're building it up very rapidly. It's the United States Navy. It'll be bigger and stronger than it ever was before. Everywhere it goes, our allies and enemies alike will know the strength and pride that symbolizes that name USS , and there it is , Marinette. Proud of it. It's great. (Applause.) I want to thank the leadership team of Fincantieri Marinette Marine for welcoming us to this incredible place. It's truly an incredible place. And now the world is watching because you're here, not because I'm here , because you're here. But the world is watching you. Including, I want to thank Jan Allman, Dario Deste, and Admiral , Vice Admiral Rick Hunt. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. (Applause.) Thanks also to Lockheed Martin Executive Vice President Stephanie Hill. Thank you, Stephanie. Great job. (Applause.) We're pleased to be joined as well by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a legend on Wall Street. And he's putting his magic to work. Our economy is coming back at a level that nobody ever imagined possible. We're doing great. We're doing great. (Applause.) And remember, as I say all the time, because we want say this in front of the media , there they are. Look at all those people , the fake news. (Applause.) We have the greatest , (applause) , we have the greatest testing program in the world. We've developed it over a period of time. And we're up to almost 30 million tests. That means we're going to have more cases. If we didn't want to test, or if we didn't test, we wouldn't have cases. But we have cases because we test. Deaths are down. We have one of the lowest mortality rates. We've done an incredible, historic job. And I want the people working on it , and not me , but I want all of those people in the task force that have done such a great job on the testing, on the ventilators , we're now making thousands of ventilators a week. When we started, we weren't making ventilators. We didn't have them and other people didn't have them. We had very few. Now we're helping other countries with the ventilator problem. A little bit like ships: They're complicated to make, they're big, they're expensive. And we're making now thousands a week and we're helping many other countries. They call and they need help. Because this horrible virus has hit 188 countries, if you can believe it. It came from China and it hit 188 countries. Not good. Not good. I want to thank Wisconsin State Representatives John Nygren and Mary Felzkowski. Mary, thank you very much. John, thank you very much. Thank you both. (Applause.) And Marinette Mayor Steve Genisot. Thank you, Steve, wherever you may be. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) We're here today to celebrate the resounding victory for all of you, for Wisconsin, for the United States military, and for our entire nation. Our nation is very proud of Wisconsin. Not long ago, the future of this historic shipyard was looking , can I use the word \"bleak\"? Yes, I think we can. It was looking bleak. You were down to 44 people, and it was getting ready to close up. Then a lot of good things came along. Despite your extraordinary service to our country over the generations, this beloved facility , the mainstay of your community, by far , you were going to , to levels of poverty. They actually had levels of poverty that nobody would have believed, with all the talent, because I see that. I understand manufacturing. Remember? \"Manufacturing was never going to come back.\" Well, it did come back. And it came back big. But I understand , (applause) , I have an aptitude for manufacturing, and I said it's got to come back and it will come back. And we were doing great. And we'll do now even better. We're going to have a better year next year, I think, than almost any year in our history. And we were going through the single-greatest year that we've ever had, from an employment standpoint, from a stock market standpoint. And your 401(k)s right now , people have 401(k)s; they're very happy with President Trump right now because they're almost at the level that they were when the virus came over. But this is a mainstay of your community, and it was facing proposed and the prospect of a final layoff and a total downsized production. Downsized to almost nothing. But this past April, Marinette's fortunes turned around, and they turned around quickly. As part of my administration's colossal rebuilding of the United States military , we've totally rebuilt the military , $2.5 trillion. And some people would say, \"Well, that's out of the budget.\" I said, \"Let me tell you something: There is no budget when it comes to our military because we don't have to , we don't want the wrong people running up the front lawn of the White House, right? (Applause.) If they were, I don't want to say, \"Well, maybe I did a lousy job with the military, but I did a great job on the budget.\" No, thank you. No, thank you. No, we have an incredible , and you know what's the greatest part about it? The greatest missiles in the world. The greatest rockets. You saw, the other day, one of the rockets go off so successfully. The greatest ships. The greatest ships. These are the greatest of their kind anywhere in the world. The fastest, the most powerful. The greatest of everything. And, you know, the beautiful thing about it, it's all made in the USA. It's made by you and your counterparts. (Applause.) It's made in the USA , the army tanks from Ohio. As part of my administration's rebuilding of the United States military, you were awarded a contract to build the next generation of guided missile frigates for the United States Navy. (Applause.) The FFG(X) , FX , is that good? FX. So you've got the FFG(X). Yeah, that's right. That's pretty good. What does that stand for, please? Would you please tell me? Does anybody know? F-F-G-X. I think nobody knows, but that's okay. It sounds good to me. But it's going to be built right here in the American Heartland, and it's going to be built by you. And it's going to go on for a long time because it's up to 20 ships, and it might be extended. And they're working on an extension right now. And we'll see. But just go. You're going to be building your hearts away. So good luck on the , on the program. The massive deal is worth up to $5.5 billion. It will put this shipyard to work constructing some of the fastest, most advanced, and most maneuverable combat ships anywhere on the ocean. I hear the maneuverability is one of the big factors that you were chosen for the contract. The other is your location in Wisconsin, if you want to know the truth. This contract will support your 1,500 full-time employees, and it will also enable you to hire another 1,000 people all across the shipyards in Wisconsin. It's one of the biggest contracts you've ever seen in the state. An estimated 15,000 additional new jobs will be created through the Wisconsin supply chain. You notice that's not a supply chain going through China and going through other countries. It's called \"The Wisconsin.\" Isn't that nice? (Applause.) The Wisconsin supply chain. (Applause.) That's been bugging me for about 25 years. I think that's why I became President, if you want to know the truth. What we've done with your great deal, the USMCA , and Canada no longer takes advantage of us like they did. People don't realize , \"Oh, Canada,\" beautiful national anthem, right? \"Oh, Canada.\" But they were brutal on trade. And now they have to treat us fairly. USMCA. We got rid of the worst trade deal ever made in the history of mankind. Humankind. You know, they'd like me to say nowadays, \"Humankind,\" right? Humankind. See the ladies? I think they like it the other way just as much. Humankind. But I just want to say that we have an incredible deal and it's going to lead to a lot of , a lot of very positive things. But the Wis- , Wisconsin supply chain , 9,000 more jobs are going to be generated because of the chain itself. And it's a truly phenomenal achievement. And I congratulate you all. It's going to be an incredible thing. It's all going to be made right here in Wisconsin. Under this administration, you know that American workers like you are a national treasure. You are indeed victory at sea. You know, victory at sea. That's what you lead us to. Your patriotism cannot be outsourced. Your eight decades of industrial heritage cannot be replicated anywhere in the world. That's why we're protecting our defense and our defensive industrial base, which we're building up stronger and stronger and stronger. And we have other places all over the country just like this. Well, let's say this is better, okay? But that's okay. Just don't tell anybody I said it. (Laughter.) But we have places , great places. Incredible people. Tremendously, tremendously successful people. People with tremendous talent. And we're doing other things in other locations , like the missiles, like the rockets, like the tanks, like all of the things that we're building. It's incredible when you see it. It's incredible. People don't realize the talent that we have. And we started getting away from it. We started not building in the Navy. We haven't built enough ships. The ships that they were building, they looked terrible. I changed designs. I looked at it. I said, \"That's a terrible-looking ship. Let's make it beautiful. It'll cost you the same, and maybe less.\" You know, sometimes, you can make it look great for less money. I said, \"This is not a good-looking ship. Let's change the design of it.\" And I got people in, and we looked at different designs. And as long as we're going to do it , and look at what you're doing, how beautiful it is. They gave me a beautiful model that's absolutely , it's like a yacht with missiles on it, okay? (Laughter.) It's, like, beautiful. But, you know, it's true: You can build beautifully. and it costs you sometimes less money. Sometimes less money. So that's why we're protecting our defensive industrial base and restoring this fundamental principle, and that's: Economic security is national security. That's what it is. Because you know what you were going through in this area of Wisconsin, just a short period of time ago. And it wasn't right, and it wasn't fair. As long as I'm your President, America will never lose that shipbuilding talent or capability. It won't lose that excellence or the expertise of the men and the women of Marinette Marine. We'll never lose that. (Applause.) Never lose it. And we'll always live by two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. Buy American and hire American. (Applause.) The first-in-class FFG(X) will not just be a win for Wisconsin workers; it will also be a major victory for our Navy. And our Navy is just incredible what we're doing with our Navy. The stunning ships will deliver the overwhelming force, lethality, and power we need to engage America's enemies anywhere and at any time. And with that, we don't want to engage. But you know how you don't have to engage? When you build a product like you're building right there. When you build product like that, you don't have to. When you don't build product like that and we go bare , you know, we rebuilt our military. Our military was totally depleted. When I became your President, we had planes that were 50 years old. We had a military that was tired. It was very tired from years of fighting endless wars , wars that never stopped. And you see what's happening on that front. We have the strongest military in the world, by far. And before, we had an old , we had a very tired military. What we had were great people in the military, but they weren't given the right equipment, so now they are. Two and a half trillion dollars. Each frigate will boast a 32-cell vertical missile launcher to take American justice to any foe, if necessary, on air, land or sea. You know about it very well. You live with it. The ship will field the most advanced air research and air search radar capability in naval history. There has never been anything so advanced as what you're building. (Applause.) Amazing. The ship is 30 times more powerful than the previous generation. That was one that got me. Thirty times , think of that , thirty times more powerful than the previous generation. And it will carry an MH-60 Seahawk helicopter and an unmanned MQ-8C Fire Scout drone. Through your sweat, skill, and devotion, the workers of this shipyard will forge the future of the United States Navy. You're going to be a very big part of the United States Navy. And there are other things coming. As you get set up with this , this is a lot to handle, but as you get set up, they're going to spending a lot of money on the renovation of the yard and the expansion of the yard. We have other things coming. And you'll fashion the ultimate symbol of American power and American prestige. Wherever the FFG(X) cuts across the horizon, it will go as a 7,500-ton message to the world that American might is second to none. (Applause.) That's right. I'd like to take a moment to recognize just a few of the hardworking patriots who are helping to bring these monumental ships to life. And that's what they are. Gary Idhe is the third generation of his family to serve at this shipyard. He has worked here for 17 years and is now a production manager. Gary, please come up and say a few words. Gary, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Gary. MR. IDHE: Thank you, Mr. President. It is an honor to be here. My name is Gary Idhe. I'm a production manager here at Fincantieri Marinette Marine. I work in building 10, the one you just toured. THE PRESIDENT: Right. MR. IDHE: The erection facility. I have been fortunate enough to be employed here for over 17 years. I started in the trades, and through hard work and dedication, I transitioned into management. These employees in front of you are here to build the best ships possible. The sense of pride felt when a ship gets launched or goes out in trials is like nothing else. These men and women breathe life into steel. Through hard work, long hours, and dedications, these individuals give the American warfighter the ship he or she needs and deserves. (Applause.) Mr. President, Wisconsin thanks you, the city of Marinette thanks you, and Fincantieri Marinette Marine thanks you. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Gary. (Applause.) He looks like he's 21 years old. He said , you've worked here a long time, Gary. Whatever you're doing, it's working. (Laughter.) You look good. We're also joined by Tyler Cahill. Tyler served for nine years in the U.S. Navy, then returned here, to his hometown, to become a quality technical coordinator. Tyler also helps recruit young talented people , usually, I guess, from Wisconsin, I think, probably. I don't know if he accepts anybody from anywhere else. You'll have to talk about that, I think. But I want to just ask Tyler, please come up and say a few words. Thank you, Tyler. (Applause.) MR. CAHILL: Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. MR. CAHILL: Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Tyler Cahill. I'm a native to the Marinette area, a former second class petty officer in the United States Navy \"Seabees,\" an Afghanistan war vet, a hockey coach, and a quality coordinator here at Marinette Marine. When I first moved back to Marinette and started here as a welder in 2012, I would've never imagined how far my career and community would grow. The shipyard is a lifeline to the community and a driving force behind its economic growth. In major part due to the LCS program and the newly awarded frigate contract, I've seen young families move to the area, friends open new local businesses, and a beautiful new sports facility opened to be utilized by the local hockey kids that I get to coach. None of this would have been possible without these contracts. So, once again, Mr. President, I would like to say thank you in allowing us to continue supporting our nation's Navy. Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Tyler. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you, Tyler. Looks like a tough hockey player. I wouldn't want to be checking him. Right, Tyler? He's a pretty tough-looking guy. The dedication of the men and women here today will also help our military accomplish one of my top national security priorities: rebuilding a 355-ship Navy. As I told you, it went way down. Very sad. After years of painful budget cuts, we ended the last administration's disastrous defense sequester. We ended the sequester. You know what that means, I think , most of you. Let's put it that way or this way: It was a very good thing that we , that we did; otherwise, you wouldn't be building these ships right now. We ended what was a true disaster. We've invested the $2.5 trillion in all of the greatest equipment in the world, and it's all made here, right in the USA. And a lot of it is going to be made in Wisconsin, outside of this facility also. And I signed a new law creating, very importantly , this was something very important to me , the sixth branch of the U.S. military: the Space Force. That's a big deal. (Applause.) That's a big deal. We're revitalizing our partnerships around the world and insisting that other nations pay their fair share in NATO. They weren't paying up, and now many of them are. Some of them still don't pay like they should. They're delinquent. You know that word? They're delinquent. No other President pressed them to pay; I pressed them to pay. And the people at NATO are very happy with me, I will tell you. The Secretary General said, \"There's never been anything like it.\" We took in $140 billion more money from other people , not from us, from other people paying their bills, because for many years, they didn't pay their bills. We were guarding nations, and they weren't paying for it. And somehow I said, \"That doesn't work too well\" , not for me, and not for you either because you're smart. This is great news for American workers and taxpayers. As part of Saudi Arabia's effort to fulfill its own defense obligations, last year the Kingdom placed a $1.3 billion order for four new vessels made by your great company. So, you know the vessels, they're getting built right now. And we felt very strongly that this is where it should be, and we gave them a strong recommendation, and they followed it. That's very good. Since 1942, when your company was founded to build five wooden barges for World War Two, this small town in Wisconsin has raised up one of the premier shipbuilding enterprises anywhere on Earth. And if you come back here in five years, you'll see one of the top places anywhere in the world. You should take immense pride in what you've done and those before you , in many cases, your fathers and your grandfathers. In many cases, your fathers are alive and very proud of the job you're doing. I met three people whose fathers worked here. And it looked like it was ending, and now they work here. And they're going to be here for a long time. And I said, \"Get your son ready, or get your daughter ready.\" Your tradition of excellence has given America two classes of combat ships: the Coast Guard cutters that patrol our maritime borders; a state-of-the-art icebreaker, which is incredible, which we had not an easy time getting approved, I will tell you that. Democrats don't like approving money for the military for whatever reason. Someday you'll explain that to me. They don't like spending money on our military. And several of the Staten Island ferries, and so much more. Doing a lot of work. The workers of this shipyard and the people of this state have always prospered and persevered by holding fast to our shared American values. In this country, we honor work. We celebrate great craftsmanship. I understand craftsmanship. I understand this world so well you wouldn't believe it. You wouldn't believe it how well I understand it and how well I appreciate it. I appreciate talent, and that's real talent, craftsmanship. And we salute the dignity and nobility of the American worker. We look out for one that you wouldn't believe. We look out for everybody. We look out for one another. We're loyal to one another, and we love our families. We want our families taken care of. We want our families to prosper. We want our community to prosper. This community was not prospering. With all that talent, they weren't prospering. And now you're all working and doing something that you love. You can't wait , I know most of you, you can't wait to get to work. That's the way I feel. And your job is much more pleasant than mine , that, I can guarantee. That, I can guarantee. Oh, you don't know what I have to go through with these people. (Applause.) They said to me, \"Sir \" , a friend of mine. Very smart. A very successful person. Used to call me \"Donald\" and now he calls me \"sir.\" He says, \"Mr. President \" I said, \"Call me \"Donald.'\" \"Yes, but I can't, Mr. President\" , which is okay. He said, \"So which is the toughest nation to deal with? Is it China? Is it possibly Russia? Or is it maybe North Korea?\" I said, \"No, the toughest nation to deal with are the Democrats in the USA.\" (Applause.) True. True. The Democrats in the USA are much tougher to deal with than any of these people that we deal with. They're far more unreasonable. And actually, they're a little crazy. (Laughter.) We take care of our communities. And when the time comes, when history calls, when our flag is threatened, we defend our country like nobody else has ever defended our country or our flag. We defend our flag. (Applause.) We stand tall, we stand strong, and we always stand proud of the United States of America. With the help of everyone here today, this shipyard will continue to prosper, this state will continue to thrive, and this nation that we love will climb to new heights of glory and to greatness. And that's what's happening right now. We're going to have a great third quarter, and we're going to have a phenomenal next year. You'll see. Next year will be one of the greatest years. You see it happening already. It's happening, and it's happening quickly. So I want to thank everybody at this amazing yard. I want to thank the grandparents and the parents who put you here. They're very proud of you. Some are looking down on you right now. They're looking down from heaven, and they're very proud of you. They're very, very proud. And I'm also very proud of you. So, congratulations to you all. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)

Thank you. Yeah, it's a good song, isn't it though? Lee Greenwood. And thank you very much. I'm thrilled to be here with you on this incredible summer day in Wisconsin on the edge of the beautiful Lake Michigan , that is beautiful too; I know it well , with the legendary workers of Marinette Marine. And you now have a lot of contracts because of the United States government. You're going to , you're going to be so busy. (Applause.) You're going to be so busy. I know you went through a little bit of a hard time; not anymore. Not anymore. Got you covered for years. For more than 75 years, the workers of this shipyard have built some 1,500 of the finest and most fearsome vessels ever to sail. You've kept our sailors safe and our Navy strong. Every single day you prove that American workers are the best in the world and now you're going to do things like you've never done before. Moments ago, I walked the length of the majestic freedom-class combat ship that many of you have been pouring your hearts and souls out for over a year. Soon, that ship will be commissioned into the most powerful fleet in human history. We're building up the Navy. We'll have 350 ships. It was actually down to a level which was , World War One , that's a long time ago, isn't it? World War One. We're building it up very rapidly. It's the United States Navy. It'll be bigger and stronger than it ever was before. Everywhere it goes, our allies and enemies alike will know the strength and pride that symbolizes that name USS , and there it is , Marinette. Proud of it. It's great. (Applause.) I want to thank the leadership team of Fincantieri Marinette Marine for welcoming us to this incredible place. It's truly an incredible place. And now the world is watching because you're here, not because I'm here , because you're here. But the world is watching you. Including, I want to thank Jan Allman, Dario Deste, and Admiral , Vice Admiral Rick Hunt. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. (Applause.) Thanks also to Lockheed Martin Executive Vice President Stephanie Hill. Thank you, Stephanie. Great job. (Applause.) We're pleased to be joined as well by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a legend on Wall Street. And he's putting his magic to work. Our economy is coming back at a level that nobody ever imagined possible. We're doing great. We're doing great. (Applause.) And remember, as I say all the time, because we want say this in front of the media , there they are. Look at all those people , the fake news. (Applause.) We have the greatest , (applause) , we have the greatest testing program in the world. We've developed it over a period of time. And we're up to almost 30 million tests. That means we're going to have more cases. If we didn't want to test, or if we didn't test, we wouldn't have cases. But we have cases because we test. Deaths are down. We have one of the lowest mortality rates. We've done an incredible, historic job. And I want the people working on it , and not me , but I want all of those people in the task force that have done such a great job on the testing, on the ventilators , we're now making thousands of ventilators a week. When we started, we weren't making ventilators. We didn't have them and other people didn't have them. We had very few. Now we're helping other countries with the ventilator problem. A little bit like ships: They're complicated to make, they're big, they're expensive. And we're making now thousands a week and we're helping many other countries. They call and they need help. Because this horrible virus has hit 188 countries, if you can believe it. It came from China and it hit 188 countries. Not good. Not good. I want to thank Wisconsin State Representatives John Nygren and Mary Felzkowski. Mary, thank you very much. John, thank you very much. Thank you both. (Applause.) And Marinette Mayor Steve Genisot. Thank you, Steve, wherever you may be. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) We're here today to celebrate the resounding victory for all of you, for Wisconsin, for the United States military, and for our entire nation. Our nation is very proud of Wisconsin. Not long ago, the future of this historic shipyard was looking , can I use the word 'bleak'? Yes, I think we can. It was looking bleak. You were down to 44 people, and it was getting ready to close up. Then a lot of good things came along. Despite your extraordinary service to our country over the generations, this beloved facility , the mainstay of your community, by far , you were going to , to levels of poverty. They actually had levels of poverty that nobody would have believed, with all the talent, because I see that. I understand manufacturing. Remember? 'Manufacturing was never going to come back.' Well, it did come back. And it came back big. But I understand , (applause) , I have an aptitude for manufacturing, and I said it's got to come back and it will come back. And we were doing great. And we'll do now even better. We're going to have a better year next year, I think, than almost any year in our history. And we were going through the single-greatest year that we've ever had, from an employment standpoint, from a stock market standpoint. And your 401(k)s right now , people have 401(k)s; they're very happy with President Trump right now because they're almost at the level that they were when the virus came over. But this is a mainstay of your community, and it was facing proposed and the prospect of a final layoff and a total downsized production. Downsized to almost nothing. But this past April, Marinette's fortunes turned around, and they turned around quickly. As part of my administration's colossal rebuilding of the United States military , we've totally rebuilt the military , $2.5 trillion. And some people would say, 'Well, that's out of the budget.' I said, 'Let me tell you something: There is no budget when it comes to our military because we don't have to , we don't want the wrong people running up the front lawn of the White House, right? (Applause.) If they were, I don't want to say, 'Well, maybe I did a lousy job with the military, but I did a great job on the budget.' No, thank you. No, thank you. No, we have an incredible , and you know what's the greatest part about it? The greatest missiles in the world. The greatest rockets. You saw, the other day, one of the rockets go off so successfully. The greatest ships. The greatest ships. These are the greatest of their kind anywhere in the world. The fastest, the most powerful. The greatest of everything. And, you know, the beautiful thing about it, it's all made in the USA. It's made by you and your counterparts. (Applause.) It's made in the USA , the army tanks from Ohio. As part of my administration's rebuilding of the United States military, you were awarded a contract to build the next generation of guided missile frigates for the United States Navy. (Applause.) The FFG(X) , FX , is that good? FX. So you've got the FFG(X). Yeah, that's right. That's pretty good. What does that stand for, please? Would you please tell me? Does anybody know? F-F-G-X. I think nobody knows, but that's okay. It sounds good to me. But it's going to be built right here in the American Heartland, and it's going to be built by you. And it's going to go on for a long time because it's up to 20 ships, and it might be extended. And they're working on an extension right now. And we'll see. But just go. You're going to be building your hearts away. So good luck on the , on the program. The massive deal is worth up to $5.5 billion. It will put this shipyard to work constructing some of the fastest, most advanced, and most maneuverable combat ships anywhere on the ocean. I hear the maneuverability is one of the big factors that you were chosen for the contract. The other is your location in Wisconsin, if you want to know the truth. This contract will support your 1,500 full-time employees, and it will also enable you to hire another 1,000 people all across the shipyards in Wisconsin. It's one of the biggest contracts you've ever seen in the state. An estimated 15,000 additional new jobs will be created through the Wisconsin supply chain. You notice that's not a supply chain going through China and going through other countries. It's called 'The Wisconsin.' Isn't that nice? (Applause.) The Wisconsin supply chain. (Applause.) That's been bugging me for about 25 years. I think that's why I became President, if you want to know the truth. What we've done with your great deal, the USMCA , and Canada no longer takes advantage of us like they did. People don't realize , 'Oh, Canada,' beautiful national anthem, right? 'Oh, Canada.' But they were brutal on trade. And now they have to treat us fairly. USMCA. We got rid of the worst trade deal ever made in the history of mankind. Humankind. You know, they'd like me to say nowadays, 'Humankind,' right? Humankind. See the ladies? I think they like it the other way just as much. Humankind. But I just want to say that we have an incredible deal and it's going to lead to a lot of , a lot of very positive things. But the Wis- , Wisconsin supply chain , 9,000 more jobs are going to be generated because of the chain itself. And it's a truly phenomenal achievement. And I congratulate you all. It's going to be an incredible thing. It's all going to be made right here in Wisconsin. Under this administration, you know that American workers like you are a national treasure. You are indeed victory at sea. You know, victory at sea. That's what you lead us to. Your patriotism cannot be outsourced. Your eight decades of industrial heritage cannot be replicated anywhere in the world. That's why we're protecting our defense and our defensive industrial base, which we're building up stronger and stronger and stronger. And we have other places all over the country just like this. Well, let's say this is better, okay? But that's okay. Just don't tell anybody I said it. (Laughter.) But we have places , great places. Incredible people. Tremendously, tremendously successful people. People with tremendous talent. And we're doing other things in other locations , like the missiles, like the rockets, like the tanks, like all of the things that we're building. It's incredible when you see it. It's incredible. People don't realize the talent that we have. And we started getting away from it. We started not building in the Navy. We haven't built enough ships. The ships that they were building, they looked terrible. I changed designs. I looked at it. I said, 'That's a terrible-looking ship. Let's make it beautiful. It'll cost you the same, and maybe less.' You know, sometimes, you can make it look great for less money. I said, 'This is not a good-looking ship. Let's change the design of it.' And I got people in, and we looked at different designs. And as long as we're going to do it , and look at what you're doing, how beautiful it is. They gave me a beautiful model that's absolutely , it's like a yacht with missiles on it, okay? (Laughter.) It's, like, beautiful. But, you know, it's true: You can build beautifully. and it costs you sometimes less money. Sometimes less money. So that's why we're protecting our defensive industrial base and restoring this fundamental principle, and that's: Economic security is national security. That's what it is. Because you know what you were going through in this area of Wisconsin, just a short period of time ago. And it wasn't right, and it wasn't fair. As long as I'm your President, America will never lose that shipbuilding talent or capability. It won't lose that excellence or the expertise of the men and the women of Marinette Marine. We'll never lose that. (Applause.) Never lose it. And we'll always live by two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. Buy American and hire American. (Applause.) The first-in-class FFG(X) will not just be a win for Wisconsin workers; it will also be a major victory for our Navy. And our Navy is just incredible what we're doing with our Navy. The stunning ships will deliver the overwhelming force, lethality, and power we need to engage America's enemies anywhere and at any time. And with that, we don't want to engage. But you know how you don't have to engage? When you build a product like you're building right there. When you build product like that, you don't have to. When you don't build product like that and we go bare , you know, we rebuilt our military. Our military was totally depleted. When I became your President, we had planes that were 50 years old. We had a military that was tired. It was very tired from years of fighting endless wars , wars that never stopped. And you see what's happening on that front. We have the strongest military in the world, by far. And before, we had an old , we had a very tired military. What we had were great people in the military, but they weren't given the right equipment, so now they are. Two and a half trillion dollars. Each frigate will boast a 32-cell vertical missile launcher to take American justice to any foe, if necessary, on air, land or sea. You know about it very well. You live with it. The ship will field the most advanced air research and air search radar capability in naval history. There has never been anything so advanced as what you're building. (Applause.) Amazing. The ship is 30 times more powerful than the previous generation. That was one that got me. Thirty times , think of that , thirty times more powerful than the previous generation. And it will carry an MH-60 Seahawk helicopter and an unmanned MQ-8C Fire Scout drone. Through your sweat, skill, and devotion, the workers of this shipyard will forge the future of the United States Navy. You're going to be a very big part of the United States Navy. And there are other things coming. As you get set up with this , this is a lot to handle, but as you get set up, they're going to spending a lot of money on the renovation of the yard and the expansion of the yard. We have other things coming. And you'll fashion the ultimate symbol of American power and American prestige. Wherever the FFG(X) cuts across the horizon, it will go as a 7,500-ton message to the world that American might is second to none. (Applause.) That's right. I'd like to take a moment to recognize just a few of the hardworking patriots who are helping to bring these monumental ships to life. And that's what they are. Gary Idhe is the third generation of his family to serve at this shipyard. He has worked here for 17 years and is now a production manager. Gary, please come up and say a few words. Gary, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Gary. Right. Thank you very much, Gary. (Applause.) He looks like he's 21 years old. He said , you've worked here a long time, Gary. Whatever you're doing, it's working. (Laughter.) You look good. We're also joined by Tyler Cahill. Tyler served for nine years in the U.S. Navy, then returned here, to his hometown, to become a quality technical coordinator. Tyler also helps recruit young talented people , usually, I guess, from Wisconsin, I think, probably. I don't know if he accepts anybody from anywhere else. You'll have to talk about that, I think. But I want to just ask Tyler, please come up and say a few words. Thank you, Tyler. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Tyler. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you, Tyler. Looks like a tough hockey player. I wouldn't want to be checking him. Right, Tyler? He's a pretty tough-looking guy. The dedication of the men and women here today will also help our military accomplish one of my top national security priorities: rebuilding a 355-ship Navy. As I told you, it went way down. Very sad. After years of painful budget cuts, we ended the last administration's disastrous defense sequester. We ended the sequester. You know what that means, I think , most of you.

Oh, you don't know what I have to go through with these people. (Applause.) They said to me, 'Sir ' , a friend of mine. Very smart. A very successful person. Used to call me 'Donald' and now he calls me 'sir.' He says, 'Mr. President ' I said, 'Call me 'Donald.' 'Yes, but I can't, Mr. President' , which is okay. He said, 'So which is the toughest nation to deal with? Is it China? Is it possibly Russia? Or is it maybe North Korea?' I said, 'No, the toughest nation to deal with are the Democrats in the USA.' (Applause.) True. True. The Democrats in the USA are much tougher to deal with than any of these people that we deal with. They're far more unreasonable. And actually, they're a little crazy. (Laughter.) We take care of our communities. And when the time comes, when history calls, when our flag is threatened, we defend our country like nobody else has ever defended our country or our flag. We defend our flag. (Applause.) We stand tall, we stand strong, and we always stand proud of the United States of America.

Very nice. Thank you. Big day. It's my pleasure to welcome you all to the beautiful, great White House and to host this magnificent showcase of America's incredible small businesses. I just got to witness some beautiful product. Today, we received outstanding news from all over our country, really. The United States economy has added almost 5 million new jobs in the month of June. That's shattering all expectations and shattering all records , historic records. History of our country, we've never added anywhere near that. And last month, we also broke the record, but now we shattered it. Much higher than even last month. This is the largest monthly jobs gain in history. We added 2.1 million leisure and hospitality jobs, 740,000 retail jobs, 568,000 education jobs and healthcare jobs, 357,000 service jobs , and very importantly to me, because you know what's happening with manufacturing, where we're bring it back because we've made incredible trade deals , so manufacturing jobs are coming back, and we added 356,000 manufacturing jobs. Incredible. Incredible numbers. All records. African American workers made historic gains, the likes of which we've never had before, with 404,000 new jobs in June. That's a record, and that's the highest number ever. We had 700,000 new jobs over the last two months for African American workers; that's the highest ever. And both , both months are the highest. We shattered last month's record. That was a record, and we shattered it. Hispanic employment is up by 1.5 million jobs. Great businessmen and women, and they're up 1.5 , think of it , million jobs. Hispanic. Eighty percent of small businesses are now open. New business applications have doubled since late March. America's economy is coming back much stronger than ever anticipated by most people, almost all people, because these numbers were , even the most optimistic people, these numbers are being doubled and tripled over what they thought would be possible. We're grateful to be joined today by Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. Thank you very much, Wilbur. Thank you very much. You're doing a great job. Every company here today embodies true American excellence. Your stunning craftsmanship , I just witnessed some of it; it's incredible , it's treasured and prized all over the world. The product you make is like none other. And your spirit for America and the greatness of our country is unrivaled. With us are workers who make decorative American flags from Virginia; fly-fishing reels from Florida; grills from Illinois; pies from North Carolina , they look very good to me; coffee from Oklahoma; ice cream from Maryland; and sunscreen and baseball bats from Texas. With unmatched skill and devotion, you make the goods and build the products that proudly bear the wonderful phrase, \"Made in the USA.\" You're seeing that more and more: \"Made in the USA.\" We're bringing our jobs back because of trade deals. We have great trade deals, and jobs are coming back. And we have a lot of great trade deals right now under negotiation. We got to get them done as quickly as possible. The small businesses represented in this room continue a great and noble American heritage. You're entrepreneurs, artisans, creators, craftsman who forge your own path, made your own products, and provide good-paying jobs for our citizens. Incredible jobs, incredible people, and they truly are artisans. And you're doing it all with American hands, American heart, and American pride. Several of these companies are entirely veteran-owned and operated. Especially as we approach Independence Day, I want to thank the courageous men and women who've served their country in uniform. We vow to honor your sacrifice by forever defending the rights, freedoms, and principles you risk your entire life to defend. Following the arrival of the plague from China , and that's what it is; it's a plague and it should have never happened. China should have never let that happen, but China did allow it to happen. We just signed a brand-new trade deal, and the ink wasn't even dry when this came over. But we raced into action to save our nation's small businesses. We passed over $3 trillion in historic relief measures , $3 trillion; think of that , including over $670 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, a tremendous success, as you can see by the numbers. To keep small-business workers on the payroll, I signed a bill providing federally funded paid sick leave and paid family leave for American workers. Things that have never been done. We're allowing businesses to defer paying their income tax. And we expanded tax refunds very substantially. Thanks to our efforts and the incredible resilience of our nation's small businesses , and I really think we can add the foundation that we built. We built the greatest economy ever built, and that foundation was so strong that, instead of coming weakly back or going in the other direction , because this is coming back, and we haven't totally succeeded yet; we will soon. But we haven't killed all of the virus yet. And yet, you look at these numbers , and that's based on a very strong foundation that we built, a foundation like no other; a foundation that, had we not been attacked by this virus, this horrible virus , we were doing things and had things planned that nobody else had ever even thought of: paying off debt; building numbers, the likes of which nobody has seen. And yet, next year, we'll be in a position where, I believe, in a certain respect, I think we'll even be stronger than we would have been because of what we're doing. But only that strong foundation allowed us to be up here today talking about these record-setting job numbers and other numbers that we're producing, because America's economy is now roaring back to life like nobody has ever seen before. Nobody has ever seen numbers like this. In May, retail sales surged by nearly 18 percent. That's a record. We recently saw the best 50-day increase in the history of the stock market. So we had 50 days , go back a couple of weeks , we had 50 days, the likes of which we've never had in the history of the stock market, which to me means jobs. And it's lifting up 401(k)s and retirement savings for American workers. We're doing numbers like nobody has ever seen before. Take a look at 401(k)s. In a pandemic, we're almost even with where we were before the pandemic started, and nobody would have said that was possible , nobody at all. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and we're now doing it again. And I think we'll do even better the second time than we did the first time, unless somebody comes along and says, \"Let's raise taxes on everybody.\" And they're raising taxes not only on corporations , they'll just go to another country, and they'll do just fine , but they're raising taxes on people and middle-income people, and they're losing jobs. So you can't allow that to happen. That will be , all of this incredible job that we've done will go down like that. It will be a terrible, terrible sight. It might even be a 1929 situation. So you have a chance to have the greatest numbers in history. You're almost there. We're almost back to where we were from the standpoint of stock market. Think of that. But you'll have a crash like you've never seen before. If you put the wrong person in office, you'll see things that you would not have believed are possible. They want to raise taxes, they want to raise regulations. You know, a big part of what we've done is by cutting regulation. We've cut regulation more than any President in the history of our country, whether they're there for four years, eight years, or in one case, more than that. Nobody even came close. And we're doing much more. We have regulation, but it's proper regulation, not strangulation. We're also tapping into the talent, genius, and the drive of our people to kill the virus. We're speeding the delivery of new treatments, including anti-viral steroids, convalescent plasma, and other therapies. We have therapeutics that are really, really looking good, and this includes two drugs that have proven effective: remdesivir and dexamethasone, which is having a tremendous trial. And we'll see how that all happens. But we have three vaccine candidates. We've had many more, but three are really, really looking good, and I think you're going to have an answer to that very soon. Three vaccine candidates are now in trial, with three more to start very shortly. These are all great companies. They've had tremendous success with other problems in the past. And we're accelerating production through Operation Warp Speed. Plus, we have our military ready, so that should we get , whether it's therapeutic or vaccine , our military is ready, logistically ready. These are the best in the world to get it out to everybody as soon as we have it. And we think we're going to have it soon. As we prepare to celebrate the Fourth of July, let us renew our devotion to this nation, to its citizens, and the eternal values that define our past and shape our future. I'm going to Mount Rushmore on July 3rd. We're going to have a tremendous evening. It's going to be a fireworks display like few people have seen. It's going to be very exciting. It's going to be beautiful. They've been wanting to do that for years , fireworks. They used to do it many years ago, and, for some reason, they were unable or unallowed to do it. They just weren't allowed to do it. And I opened it up, and we're going to have a tremendous July 3rd. And then we're coming back here, celebrating the Fourth of July in Washington, D.C. And I want to also thank all of law enforcement. The job you've done is incredible. We signed a bill. If you play with our monuments or our statues, you go to jail for 10 years. It's amazing how it all stops so fast. Stops so fast. We let the local authorities handle it as long as possible, but ultimately we said, \"Let's step in.\" And we stepped in and it stopped. Ten years in jail if they do what they were doing. So we're very proud of law enforcement. We want to thank law enforcement. Really great job. Our military has been incredible. Our National Guard has been just incredible all over. I'm glad to see, in Seattle, they took care of the problem, because as they know, we were going in to take. We were ready to go in and they knew that too. And they went in and they did what they had to do. We're a nation committed to equal and abundant opportunity for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. The American Dream is the sacred birthright of every American child, and that's what we have, is we have the American Dream. And nobody is going to shatter the American Dream , not the anarchists, not the agitators, not the fools, not the looters. They're not going to have any impact on the national dream , the national dream like no other. That's why we're here today, to ensure that every citizen can achieve their dream, achieve their destiny, and realize their full and extraordinary potential. That is how we will renew, rebuild, and restore America. We've done an incredible job in a three-and-a-half-year period, a job like nobody thought would be possible to be done. And we're doing it again, and we're doing it, I believe, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. You're going to see that next year. And unless it's tampered with, we're going to have a year next year like no other. It'll be a phenomenal year, a successful year. And we'll have our best job numbers ever next year. We'll come back stronger and more prosperous than ever before. Next year will be , I think it'll be one of the , from an economic standpoint, the greatest or one of the greatest economic years we've ever had. So I just want to thank everybody for being here. I want to thank all of these incredible artisans and business people for showcasing your amazing products. And I just want to leave you by saying very important words: God bless America. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.) END 12:08 P.M.

Very nice. Thank you. Big day. It's my pleasure to welcome you all to the beautiful, great White House and to host this magnificent showcase of America's incredible small businesses. I just got to witness some beautiful product. Today, we received outstanding news from all over our country, really. The United States economy has added almost 5 million new jobs in the month of June. That's shattering all expectations and shattering all records , historic records. History of our country, we've never added anywhere near that. And last month, we also broke the record, but now we shattered it. Much higher than even last month. This is the largest monthly jobs gain in history. We added 2.1 million leisure and hospitality jobs, 740,000 retail jobs, 568,000 education jobs and healthcare jobs, 357,000 service jobs , and very importantly to me, because you know what's happening with manufacturing, where we're bring it back because we've made incredible trade deals , so manufacturing jobs are coming back, and we added 356,000 manufacturing jobs. Incredible. Incredible numbers. All records. African American workers made historic gains, the likes of which we've never had before, with 404,000 new jobs in June. That's a record, and that's the highest number ever. We had 700,000 new jobs over the last two months for African American workers; that's the highest ever. And both , both months are the highest. We shattered last month's record. That was a record, and we shattered it. Hispanic employment is up by 1.5 million jobs. Great businessmen and women, and they're up 1.5 , think of it , million jobs. Hispanic. Eighty percent of small businesses are now open. New business applications have doubled since late March. America's economy is coming back much stronger than ever anticipated by most people, almost all people, because these numbers were , even the most optimistic people, these numbers are being doubled and tripled over what they thought would be possible. We're grateful to be joined today by Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. Thank you very much, Wilbur. Thank you very much. You're doing a great job.

Are you having a good time? (Applause.) Members of Congress, members of my cabinet, and my fellow Americans: The First Lady and I are delighted to welcome you to the second annual Salute to America. (Applause.) On this wonderful day, we celebrate our history, our heroes, our heritage, our great American flag, and our freedom. Happy Fourth of July to everyone. (Applause.) I want to thank the U.S. Army Golden Knights for that truly awe-inspiring display. Tremendous talent. The Golden Knights, and every member of the Armed Forces here this evening, we just want to say that you have earned the eternal gratitude of our entire nation. Two hundred and forty-four years ago in Philadelphia, the 56 signers of our Declaration of Independence pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to boldly proclaim this eternal truth: that we are all made equal by God. (Applause.) Thanks to the courage of those patriots of July 4th, 1776, the American Republic stands today as the greatest, most exceptional, and most virtuous nation in the history of the world. Our workers, our factories have revolutionized industries and lifted millions into prosperity. Our artists, architects, and engineers have inspired the globe with transcendent works of beauty. American heroes defeated the Nazis, dethroned the fascists, toppled the communists, saved American values, upheld American principles, and chased down the terrorists to the very ends of the Earth. We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters, and people who, in many instances, have absolutely no clue what they are doing. (Applause.) Our inventors, scientists, doctors, and researchers have improved the lives of billions and billions all around the world. Our brave astronauts planted the American flag on the Moon, and America will be the first nation to land on Mars. (Applause.) All Americans living today are the heirs of this magnificent legacy. We are the descendants of the most daring and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the Earth. We inherit their towering confidence, unwavering enthusiasm, their unbridled ambition, and their unrelenting optimism. This is the untamed spirit that built this glorious nation, and this is the spirit that burns brightly within the soul of every American patriot. That is why we pay tribute to generations of American heroes whose names are etched on our monuments and memorials, and in the pages of history, and in the hearts of a very grateful people. We will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children, or trample on our freedoms. (Applause.) We will safeguard our values, traditions, customs, and beliefs. We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so that they can build its future. Together, we will fight for the American Dream, and we will defend, protect, and preserve American way of life, which began in 1492 when Columbus discovered America. (Applause.) Jobs and companies are coming back to our country like never before. The power of tariffs being imposed on foreign lands that took advantage of the United States for decades and decades have enabled us to make great trade deals where there were none. Tens of billions of dollars are now paid to the United States Treasury by the same countries. But there and then we got hit by the virus that came from China. And we've made a lot of progress; our strategy is moving along well. It goes out in one area, and rears back its ugly face in another area. But we've learned a lot. We've learned how to put out the flame. We've made ventilators where there were none by the tens of thousands, to the point that we have far more than we need, and we are now distributing them to many foreign countries, as a gesture of goodwill. Likewise, testing , there were no tests for a new virus, but now we have tested over 40 million people. But by so doing, we show cases, 99 percent of which are totally harmless. Results that no other country will show, because no other country has testing that we have , not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality. And now, just like everything else, we have become the manufacturer on record for ventilators, we have the most and finest testing anywhere in the world, and are producing gowns and masks and surgical equipment in our country where heretofore it was almost exclusively made in foreign lands, in particular, China, where, ironically, this virus and others came from. China's secrecy, deceptions, and cover-up allowed it to spread all over the world , 189 countries , and China must be held fully accountable. (Applause.) With respect to remedies, we are now doing unbelievably well, and are in deep testing on vaccines, treatments, and therapeutics. I want to send our thanks to the scientists and researchers around the country and even around the world who are at the forefront of our historic effort to rapidly develop and deliver life-saving treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. We are unleashing our nation's scientific brilliance. And we'll likely have a therapeutic and\/or vaccine solution long before the end of the year. (Applause.) We're grateful to be joined this evening by Americans battling on the frontlines to kill the virus. I just want to say that America thanks you. Please stand. Please. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Great, brilliant people. These are great and brilliant people. Thank you. And brave people. (Applause.) Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest, God-given potential. Never forget: We are one family and one nation. This rich heritage belongs to every citizen, young and old, first-generation American and tenth-generation American. This heritage belongs to every citizen, young and old , first-generation American , we want to go from first generation to tenth generation; it matters not. We are American. We are from the USA. (Applause.) This great heritage belongs to citizens of every background and of every walk of life. No matter our race, color, religion, or creed, we are one America, and we put America first. (Applause.) We will not allow anyone to divide our citizens by race or background. We will not allow them to foment hate, discord, and distrust. We will hold fast and true to the sacred loyalties that link us all as neighbors, as Americans, and as patriots. In every age, there have always been those who seek to lie about the past in order to gain power in the present. Those that are lying about our history, those who want us to be ashamed of who we are, are not interested in justice or in healing. Their goal is demolition. Our goal is not to destroy the greatest structure on Earth, what we have built: The United States of America. (Applause.) To build a future , (applause) , where every family is safe, where every child is surrounded by love, where every community has equal opportunity, and every citizen enjoys great and everlasting dignity. Our past is not a burden to be cast away, it is not a miraculous foundation that will lift us to the next great summit of human endeavor. The incredible story of American progress is the story of each generation picking up where the last finished , linked by time, by fate, and the eternal bonds of our national affection. Those who would sever those bonds would cut us off from the wisdom, the courage, the love, and the devotion that gave us everything we are today and everything we strive for tomorrow. We cannot let that happen. We will not throw away our heroes. We will honor them, and we will prove worthy of their sacrifice. (Applause.) These are great heroes. Let me also say a word to those in the media who falsely and consistently label their opponents as racists, who condemn patriotic citizens who offer a clear and truthful defense of American unity. That's what our people are doing. We want a clear and faithful defense of American history and we want unity. When you level these false charges, you not only slander me, you not only slander the American people, but you slander generations of heroes who gave their lives for America. (Applause.) You slander people much braver and much more principled than you. You are slandering the young men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima, and those who perished fighting for freedom in the Civil War. You slander them. You are dishonoring their great legacy and their memory by insisting that they fought for racism and they fought for oppression. They didn't fight for those things; they fought for the exact opposite. We will not let the legacy of these heroes be tarnished by you. The more you lie, the more you slander, the more you try to demean and divide, the more we will work hard to tell the truth. And we will win. (Applause.) The more you lie and demean and collude, the more credibility you lose. We want to bring the country together, and a free and open media will make this task a very easy one. Our country will be united. After all, what do we want? We want a strong military, great education, housing, low taxes, law and order. We want safety, we want equal justice, we want religious liberty, we want faith and family, and living in a great communities and happy communities and safe communities. And we want great jobs and we want to be respected by the rest of the world; not taken advantage of by the rest of the world, which has gone on for decade after decade. We should all want the same thing. How can it be any different than those things? The more bitter you become, the more we will appeal to love and patriotism, and the more we will rise above your hate to build a better future for every child in our great country. To celebrate America's majestic inheritance, yesterday I signed an executive order to create a brand-new monument to our most beloved icons. The National Garden of American Heroes will be a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans who have ever lived. We will honor extraordinary citizens from every community and from every place and from every part of our nation. Great men and great women, people that we can look up to forever. Families will be able to walk among the statues of titans, and we have already selected the first 30 legacies and 30 legends. And why don't we start with a man who has been very unfairly treated, who, two years ago, three years ago , especially five or six years ago , people would have said it's impossible to even attempt to try and disturb his incredible legacy and success: George Washington. (Applause.) Thomas Jefferson , (applause) , Betsy Ross , (applause) , Alexander Hamilton , (applause) , Benjamin Franklin , (applause) , John Adams , (applause) , James Madison , (applause) , Dolly Madison , (applause) , the great Frederick Douglass , (applause) , Abraham Lincoln , (applause) , Harriet Tubman , (applause) , Harriet Beecher Stowe , (applause) , Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain , (applause) , Clara Barton , (applause) , Daniel Boone , (applause) , Davy Crockett , (applause) , Henry Clay , (applause) , Susan B. Anthony , (applause) , Booker T. Washington , (applause) , Orville and Wilbur Wright, who are looking down. And you're going to see some planes like you have never seen before, because we build them better than anybody in the world. The greatest Air Force, the greatest fighters, the greatest everything. You're going to be seeing something , I just wonder what Orville and Wilbur would have been thinking if they ever got to see that. But they're looking. They're checking it out right now along with us. Amelia Earhart. (Applause). A great, great athlete no matter where he went; he was the best athlete: Jackie Robinson. (Applause.) George S. Patton , General Patton. He didn't know how to lose. (Applause.) He didn't don't how to lose. General Douglas MacArthur , (applause) , Audie Murphy , (applause) , the great Billy Graham , (applause) , and an incredible man, respected by everybody: Martin Luther King. (Applause.) President Ronald Reagan. (Applause.) Christa McAuliffe, and Antonin Scalia. (Applause.) So those are just a few of the people we'll be naming, and things are subject to change, but once we make that decision, those great names are going to be up there and they're never coming down. They have just been an incredible group. And we are going to do this in a very democratic way, frankly. We're going to take names and suggestions. We're going to have committees and we're going to pick the greatest people that this country has ever known. The most respected people. The people that helped us the most. And the people that we can look up to and that our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren can look up to into the future and they can say, \"Isn't America just a tremendous place?\" So, thank you. That will be very exciting. (Applause.) The patriots who built our country were not villains, they were heroes whose courageous deeds improved the Earth beyond measure. The beauty and the glory of our constitutional system is that it gives us the tools to fight injustice, to heal division, and to continue the work of our Founding Fathers by expanding and growing the blessings of America. If you believe in justice, if you believe in freedom, if you believe in peace, then you must cherish the principles of our founding and the text of our Constitution. It is our founding and our Constitution. It is a firm foundation upon which all progress is achieved. That's why our country is so strong, even despite terrible things that happen over the generations. Here this evening are a number of heroes who risk their own lives to uphold these values and keep our communities and our country safe. We are joined by the outstanding law enforcement officers who have been able to fight on the front lines, protecting our cities , many of them facing down violent assaults from very bad people. We are especially moved to be joined by the family of a great man: Fallen Officer David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department who was killed last month in the city he devoted his life to defending. (Applause.) And to David's great family, I want to thank you very much. The American people will always support the courageous men and women of law enforcement. And nobody , nobody , embodies that better than David. Thank you very much. Please. (Applause.) And David is looking down right now, and he is so proud of you and he loves you so much. And thank you for being here. He's a great man. He's a great man. Finally tonight, we will salute the greatness and loyalty and valor of the men and women who have defended our independence for 244 years. We will honor the amazing men and women of the United States Military. (Applause.) Never in history has a nation used so much power to advance so much good. Battlefields across the world, and here at home, are marked with the gravestones of young patriots who spent their final valiant moments on this Earth to secure liberty and peace. Every child should be taught the military heroes who fought and died to make us free. These are great, great people. These are great, great heroes, indeed. (Applause.) And our greatest leaders and heroes should be recognized and even immortalized for coming generations to see. You know that. This will make our country even stronger long into the future. In a few moments, we will bear witness to awesome aircraft representing every major military conflict over the last 75 years. These planes once launched off massive aircraft carriers in the fiercest battles of World War II. They raced through the skies of Korea's MiG Alley. They carried American warriors into the dense fields and jungles of Vietnam. They delivered a swift and swip- , and you know that sweeping , it was swift and it was sweeping like nobody has ever seen anything happen , a victory in Operation Desert Storm. A lot of you were involved in that. (Applause.) A lot of you were involved. That was a quick one. And they have gone on to dangerous missions around the world to take out enemy terrorists and bring our soldiers home safely. As you know, we've killed, this last year, the two leading terrorists of the last 10 years: al-Baghdadi and Soleimani. Killed. Gone. Over. (Applause.) We have worked to fully rebuild the Armed Forces of the United States. No enemy on Earth stands a chance , $2.5 trillion, we've invested , all made in the USA. We've never had anything near the power and the equipment that we have right now. We did that over the last three years. Everywhere these aircraft have flown, they've rained down American thunder, delivered American justice, and they have fiercely defended every square inch of American sovereignty.In their steel frames, broad wings, and roaring engines, we see the story of America's daring defiance, its soaring spirit, and undying resolve. Throughout our history, our country has been tested and tried , but we have always fought to victory. Whenever our way of life has been threatened, our ancestors have responded with the same resounding answer as those first patriots who fought for independence: We are Americans, and we never back down, we never give in, and we never give up, and we will never yield [in] defense of our nation. We love our nation. We will only fight to win. Today, we thank God for the gift of life and for the blessing of liberty. We honor the legends of our history, the glories of our Founding Fathers, and the giants of the past, and the heroes of today who keep us safe, who keep us strong and proud, and who keep us free. Once again, Happy July Fourth to all. Our country is in great shape. Our military has never been stronger. And many, many good things are going to happen. Next year will be one of the greatest years we've ever had. I want to thank our men and women , they are so good , of the National Park Service, Air Traffic Control, and the United States Military. God Bless you, God Bless our heroes, God bless America. And now, let the flyovers begin. Thank you very much. (Applause.)

Are you having a good time? (Applause.) Members of Congress, members of my cabinet, and my fellow Americans: The First Lady and I are delighted to welcome you to the second annual Salute to America. (Applause.) On this wonderful day, we celebrate our history, our heroes, our heritage, our great American flag, and our freedom. Happy Fourth of July to everyone. (Applause.) I want to thank the U.S. Army Golden Knights for that truly awe-inspiring display. Tremendous talent. The Golden Knights, and every member of the Armed Forces here this evening, we just want to say that you have earned the eternal gratitude of our entire nation. Two hundred and forty-four years ago in Philadelphia, the 56 signers of our Declaration of Independence pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to boldly proclaim this eternal truth: that we are all made equal by God. (Applause.) Thanks to the courage of those patriots of July 4th, 1776, the American Republic stands today as the greatest, most exceptional, and most virtuous nation in the history of the world. Our workers, our factories have revolutionized industries and lifted millions into prosperity. Our artists, architects, and engineers have inspired the globe with transcendent works of beauty. American heroes defeated the Nazis, dethroned the fascists, toppled the communists, saved American values, upheld American principles, and chased down the terrorists to the very ends of the Earth. We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters, and people who, in many instances, have absolutely no clue what they are doing. (Applause.) Our inventors, scientists, doctors, and researchers have improved the lives of billions and billions all around the world. Our brave astronauts planted the American flag on the Moon, and America will be the first nation to land on Mars. (Applause.) All Americans living today are the heirs of this magnificent legacy. We are the descendants of the most daring and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the Earth. We inherit their towering confidence, unwavering enthusiasm, their unbridled ambition, and their unrelenting optimism. This is the untamed spirit that built this glorious nation, and this is the spirit that burns brightly within the soul of every American patriot. That is why we pay tribute to generations of American heroes whose names are etched on our monuments and memorials, and in the pages of history, and in the hearts of a very grateful people. We will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children, or trample on our freedoms. (Applause.) We will safeguard our values, traditions, customs, and beliefs. We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so that they can build its future. Together, we will fight for the American Dream, and we will defend, protect, and preserve American way of life, which began in 1492 when Columbus discovered America. (Applause.) Jobs and companies are coming back to our country like never before. The power of tariffs being imposed on foreign lands that took advantage of the United States for decades and decades have enabled us to make great trade deals where there were none. Tens of billions of dollars are now paid to the United States Treasury by the same countries. But there and then we got hit by the virus that came from China. And we've made a lot of progress; our strategy is moving along well. It goes out in one area, and rears back its ugly face in another area. But we've learned a lot. We've learned how to put out the flame. We've made ventilators where there were none by the tens of thousands, to the point that we have far more than we need, and we are now distributing them to many foreign countries, as a gesture of goodwill. Likewise, testing , there were no tests for a new virus, but now we have tested over 40 million people. But by so doing, we show cases, 99 percent of which are totally harmless. Results that no other country will show, because no other country has testing that we have , not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality. And now, just like everything else, we have become the manufacturer on record for ventilators, we have the most and finest testing anywhere in the world, and are producing gowns and masks and surgical equipment in our country where heretofore it was almost exclusively made in foreign lands, in particular, China, where, ironically, this virus and others came from. China's secrecy, deceptions, and cover-up allowed it to spread all over the world , 189 countries , and China must be held fully accountable. (Applause.) With respect to remedies, we are now doing unbelievably well, and are in deep testing on vaccines, treatments, and therapeutics. I want to send our thanks to the scientists and researchers around the country and even around the world who are at the forefront of our historic effort to rapidly develop and deliver life-saving treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. We are unleashing our nation's scientific brilliance. And we'll likely have a therapeutic and\/or vaccine solution long before the end of the year. (Applause.) We're grateful to be joined this evening by Americans battling on the frontlines to kill the virus. I just want to say that America thanks you. Please stand. Please. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Great, brilliant people. These are great and brilliant people. Thank you. And brave people. (Applause.) Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest, God-given potential. Never forget: We are one family and one nation. This rich heritage belongs to every citizen, young and old, first-generation American and tenth-generation American. This heritage belongs to every citizen, young and old , first-generation American , we want to go from first generation to tenth generation; it matters not. We are American. We are from the USA. (Applause.) This great heritage belongs to citizens of every background and of every walk of life. No matter our race, color, religion, or creed, we are one America, and we put America first. (Applause.) We will not allow anyone to divide our citizens by race or background. We will not allow them to foment hate, discord, and distrust. We will hold fast and true to the sacred loyalties that link us all as neighbors, as Americans, and as patriots. In every age, there have always been those who seek to lie about the past in order to gain power in the present. Those that are lying about our history, those who want us to be ashamed of who we are, are not interested in justice or in healing. Their goal is demolition. Our goal is not to destroy the greatest structure on Earth, what we have built: The United States of America. (Applause.) To build a future , (applause) , where every family is safe, where every child is surrounded by love, where every community has equal opportunity, and every citizen enjoys great and everlasting dignity. Our past is not a burden to be cast away, it is not a miraculous foundation that will lift us to the next great summit of human endeavor. The incredible story of American progress is the story of each generation picking up where the last finished , linked by time, by fate, and the eternal bonds of our national affection. Those who would sever those bonds would cut us off from the wisdom, the courage, the love, and the devotion that gave us everything we are today and everything we strive for tomorrow. We cannot let that happen. We will not throw away our heroes. We will honor them, and we will prove worthy of their sacrifice. (Applause.) These are great heroes. Let me also say a word to those in the media who falsely and consistently label their opponents as racists, who condemn patriotic citizens who offer a clear and truthful defense of American unity.

You know where we're going, and it won't be long. We'll back here pretty early. Discussing a lot of very interesting topics. The markets are very good. The country is doing well. Jobs are growing fast. We want schools to be open, and they will be open. And they'll be open, I think, relatively on time. Hopefully, perfectly on time, most places. And do you have any question? Yeah. Q Mr. President, what's your reaction to your former Attorney General Jeff Sessions's loss in Alabama yesterday? THE PRESIDENT: I'm very happy that Tommy Tuberville won the race. I think he's going to be a great senator. We don't have a good senator in there right now. And Jones, he's not doing the job. He should be doing a much better job. Certainly he doesn't represent the views of the people of Alabama , that's for sure. So we're not happy about him at all. I don't think the people of Alabama are happy with their representation in the Senate. And Tommy Tuberville is going to be a great senator. He was a great coach. I spoke to another coach last night , unrelated , and he said, \"Tommy Tuberville was a great coach and he's a great guy.\" Someday I'll tell you who said that, but he's somebody respected. So it was a great , it was a tremendous win for Tommy Tuberville last night. I'm very happy about it. And also a tremendous win for Ronny Jackson, and it looks like it could be a tremendous win for a gentleman named Gonzales. You know about that too. That race is still a little bit going on. By the time I got involved, a lot of the votes were already cast. But I got involved, really, at the last moment. We think he can easily win that area. So , and two very good candidates. Reyes is a great candidate and so is Gonzales. But when I got involved, a lot of the votes , early votes were cast, and it was a big comeback. It was a big comeback. So that's going to be a very interesting race. The other thing , very, very amazing , somebody you all know is Ronny Jackson. Admiral Ronny and Doc Ronny. We call him a lot of different things. But everybody agrees: They respect Ronny Jackson a lot. Yeah. Q Mr. President, you declared MS-13 as a terrorist organization this morning. Are you going to plan to do the same thing with Antifa and leftist organizations that you say cause trouble? THE PRESIDENT: It could happen. It could happen. Antifa is no good. They're bad. They're bad people, and it could very well happen. Q Mr. President, why do you want coronavirus data going to HHS first instead of the CDC? Why make that change? THE PRESIDENT: Didn't change for me. I , look, they're all on the same team. We're all on the same team, including Dr. Fauci. I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci. And we're all on the same team. We want to get rid of this mess that China sent us. So everybody is working on the same line, and we're doing very well. We're doing well in a lot of ways, and our country is coming back very strong. When you look at those job numbers , we've never had job numbers like we have right now. So it's coming back very strongly. Okay? Q Has Peter Navarro gone rogue? THE PRESIDENT: Well, he made a statement representing himself. He shouldn't be doing that. No, I , I have a very good relationship with Anthony. Thank you very much. Thank you. END 1:32 P.M.

Please. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be here. And thank you, Dan. I'm thrilled to be in the great state of Ohio. You were very good to me, but I've been very good to you. (Applause.) I've been very good to you. We've been good to each other. With the incredible men and women of Whirlpool, the largest washing machine factory anywhere in the world. Every day, 20,000 gleaming new machines coming rolling off that beautiful assembly line , I just got to see it , and every single one is proudly inscribed with that glorious phrase, \"Made in the USA.\" Remember? (Applause.) Made in the USA. When I was campaigning, I said, \"Let's go. \"Made in the USA.' Put it on your machines. Put it on everything we make.\" I'm grateful to everyone at Whirlpool for welcoming us today, including Marc Bitzer , thank you , Jim Keppler and Sarah Bovim. Thank you very much. Sarah? Where's Sarah? Thank you. Thank you very much. Sarah Bovim. Also with us today is Secretary of Labor Gene Scalia and a warrior , I'm sure you never heard of him; he's a warrior, a great, great wrestling champion and a great guy: Jim Jordan. (Applause.) Jim. He is a warrior. Thanks, Jim. And he's tough. I'm not going to wrestle him ever. I promise. And another warrior , a great fellow who has been right at our side. He works with Jim and I so much and so hard: Bob Latta. Bob. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you, Bob. Also, Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted. Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Jon. (Applause.) Thank you. State Senate President Larry Obhof. Larry, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you, Larry. Thank you, Larry. Clyde Mayor Scott Black and many other distinguished guests. Great people. (Applause.) Great representatives. Thank you, fellas. Thank you very much. As we celebrate Whirlpool's 109-year legacy of American manufacturing excellence, today I want to lay out my vision to bring millions and millions more jobs and thousands more factories back to American shores where they belong. We've been doing it long and hard. One of the reasons you're successful today happens to be a meeting I had probably four years ago with a very good representative of your company, saying what they were doing to you and how badly you were being treated by other countries. And you know what I did. And here we are today, the most successful plant. (Applause.) And we've done this in a lot of places. The duty of a President is to put this nation's own citizens first. That's why my administration swears by two simple but crucial rules: Buy American and Hire American. (Applause.) And no one knows better than the workers of Whirlpool the high cost of past administrations' economic blunders and surrender. On the question of foreign trade, previous leaders were guided by a shameful policy of capitulation, submission, and retreat. For decades, you watched as politicians let foreign nations steal our jobs, loot our factories, and plunder the crown jewels of the U.S. economy. And the word \"plunder\" is capitalized. Washington stood idly by as other countries engaged in unfair trade practices, such as massive subsidies, currency manipulation, and in the case of your industry and your company, the wholesale dumping of foreign-made products sold below cost for the sole purpose of driving you out of business so they could give us product at double, triple, and quadruple the price. But we didn't let that happen, did we? (Applause.) For eight years, Whirlpool begged the Obama-Biden administration, who did nothing, to protect American workers from the flagrant dumping of foreign washers, dryers into America. But your cries for help fell on deaf ears. You didn't see any action. They didn't act. They didn't care, and they never will. For eight long years under Obama-Biden administration, American factory workers received nothing but broken promises and brazen sellouts and lost jobs. The last administration tied America up in one globalist debacle after another. They catered to the special interests while allowing foreign nations to siphon off our wealth, our dignity, our dreams, our money. The suffering of our workers was met with nothing but cruel betrayal and callous indifference. In 2013, the U.S. International Trade Commission found your competitors from Korea and other countries guilty of dumping washers into the U.S. market and ordered them to pay anti-dumping duties as high as 79 percent. But rather than pay these very high tariffs, LG and Samsung relocated production to another country , a country called China. Have you ever heard of it? And the last administration did nothing as they kept on dumping washers into the U.S. market with impunity. The Obama-Biden administration was laughed at. They were a joke. And they were perfectly happy to let China win, your jobs disappear, and your factory to close. And you know what it was like. I came through today, and everybody was out there. Tremendous crowds, waving and cheering. I said, \"I must have done it right,\" because you had people that were really , really something. (Applause.) Because four or five years ago, this place was a disaster. In 2017, Whirlpool won relief from the ITC once again. Once more, your foreign competitors moved their factories to prevent a level playing field and to avoid liability, shifting production to Th-ailand and to Vietnam , Thailand and Vietnam, two places that I like their leaders very much. They're very nice to us. Do they take advantage of the United States? Not so much anymore. But this time, there was one big difference: Instead of an administration that sold out American workers and sold your company out and couldn't have cared less for you, you finally had a president who stood up for the American worker. On January 23rd, 2018, at my desk in the Oval Office, I proudly signed the order to impose a 50 percent tariff on all foreign-made washing machines. (Applause.) As a result, Whirlpool's nine factories across the United States were soon thriving like never before, investing in new products, new infrastructure, and hundreds of new American jobs. And I just took a tour, and I actually wanted a couple of those machines for myself , (laughter) , but I just didn't know it was going to be appropriate to ask. But they are beautiful. That includes thousands of new jobs across the Ohio supply chain, from right here in Clyde to Findlay, Ottawa, Greenville, and Marion. (Applause.) All over. Your company became a shining example. From, really, a company that was down and out, it became a shining example of what tough trade policies and smart tariffs can bring to , jobs and prosperity to communities like this one all over Ohio Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and plenty of other states. They're all doing well. They were doing great. Then the plague came in, and now they're doing great again. We closed it up; we saved millions of lives. But now we're opening, and it looks like I was right about the \"V,\" because you're seeing the kind of numbers that are coming in, and they're coming in strong. They're coming in strong. (Applause.) Should have never happened. Should have never happened. China should have never let it happen. In defending your jobs here at Whirlpool, I was doing exactly what I promised in June 2016. As a candidate for President, I stood before an audience of hardworking patriots at a metals processing facility outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to outline my plan for a new America First trade policy. And it was even a better job than I told you. I'm one politician that says \"I'm going to do this,\" and then we do better. We produced more than I promised. And, by the way, the wall is being built. It's going to be finished very soon. (Applause.) In my speech, I warned that our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization , moving our jobs, our wealth, and our factories overseas. I explained that globalization , these are the globalists. I'm not liking globalists too much, but they don't like me too much either. Globalization has made the financial elites, who donate to politicians, very wealthy, but it's left millions and millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache, and our towns and cities with empty factories and plants. For years later, we've made extraordinary progress in reversing the dangerous tide of globalism; over a period of four to five years, this took place. Think of it: four to five years. What we've done is a miracle, and now it's getting even better because we've taken additional steps. And, you know, when you do these steps, you have to go through statutory procedures. It's not like, \"Boom, I'm going to just sign it.\" It has to go out for 90 days of review, then 120 days of review, then more. And we did it as quick as we can. We're doing it right now, with the FDA; we're getting vaccines approved in days that nobody thought possible. It would take years and years, and we're doing it in months, and we're doing very well. Under my administration, we're fighting for Main Street, not Wall Street. We have rejected globalism and embraced patriotism. In my speech in Pittsburgh, in June of 2016, I made seven big promises to American workers. Many politicians before me promised change on the campaign trail, only to back down in the face of corporate and international pressure. Like Jerusalem. They all promised Jerusalem , didn't they? , for years and years. I did it; they didn't do it. They didn't do it. I did it. (Applause.) Moved the embassy to Jerusalem, making Jerusalem the capital of Israel. They all talked about it. They talked and talked and talked, and then they got into office, and they didn't do it. And I understand why: The pressure was enormous. On me, too. I just didn't take the phone calls. That's true. Leaders would call up from other countries. I'd say, \"I know what they're calling about. I'll call them back in a few days.\" Then I just signed all the papers, got it done, and then I called them back. And they said, \"I was calling about Israel and Jerusalem, but you've already done it.\" I said, \"That's right.\" And they said, \"Oh, okay.\" (Laughter.) I said, \"Hey, I wish you got me a little bit earlier.\" (Laughter and applause.) But I didn't back down from my promises, and I've kept every single one. First, I promised to withdraw the United States from the last administration's disastrous assault on U.S. workers: the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It would have been a disaster. It would have been a disaster, especially for the automobile industry. It would have put it out of business. My first week in office, I kept that promise and canceled that job-killing catastrophe. Second, I pledged to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to defend American jobs, and I did with Bob Lighthizer and all of his people. They've been fantastic. Third, I said I would use every legal tool at my disposal to fight back against unfair trade, and I did. And I found some that nobody even knew about. Some of them were very old. They had a lot of dust on them. Hadn't been used for decades and decades. But I found them , things you could never get passed today. Fourth, I promised to label China a \"currency manipulator,\" and I did. Fifth, I said we would bring trade cases against China to crack down on its economic aggression. Sixth, I committed to impose tariffs on goods to protect American jobs and stop China and many other countries' abuses under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. As your President, I have kept every single one of these pledges to the American people and to the American worker, without exception. Every one has been done. (Applause.) Seventh, one of my biggest promises in that speech was to replace the disaster known as NAFTA , one of the worst trade deals ever made by any country, let alone ours. Ohio lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed. Half of all of the automaking jobs across the state were wiped out. Earlier this year, I finally ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand-new USMCA agreement. That's United States and Mexico and Canada. And all of those bad things that you had to suffer with, you're not suffering anymore, because now people and companies have an incentive to stay. They're not going to be leaving so fast. (Applause.) That was the biggest point I made. I want to make sure that these companies aren't leaving. And the managers walk up, and they say, \"I'm sorry, our company is leaving and going to Mexico\" , or Canada , but going, primarily, in that case, to Mexico. Canada takes advantage of us with dairy , unbelievable advantage , but not anymore. But Mexico took a lot of jobs. And I said, \"I don't want companies moving. And if they do move \" Remember? You've heard it. \"If they do move when they make that product, they got to pay a big price to sell it back into our country.\" So they have no more incentive to move. The USMCA contains powerful new protections for American manufacturers, automakers, farmers, dairy producers, and workers all across Ohio and all of our states. Those were key promises I made to American workers in 2016; I kept every single one of them. The fake news media back there, they hate to report this. They hate it. (Applause.) Why do they hate it? Because they're fake. Today, to define our path forward, I'm making our incredible workers six more promises that I will keep over the next four years, and I'm very proud to make them at your plant and in the state of Ohio. First and foremost, we will defeat the China virus. We're working very, very hard. We call it the \"China virus.\" We call it the \"invisible enemy.\" We call it many different names. It's got many different names, but it's bad. And we've made tremendous strides. We're attacking the virus from every angle. And through this aggressive strategy, we will win the war, and it will happen sooner than people think. We're developing a bounty of therapies such as remdesivir, dexamethasone, antibody treatments , the antibody treatments are really working out well, really well , and many more that have allowed us to reduce mortality by 85 percent since April. Under Operation Warp Speed, two vaccines are already in the final stage of clinical trials. And we'll have a vaccine very soon , I hope long before the end of the year. We've dramatically increased our domestic production of personal protective equipment, such as N95 respirators, gowns, and gloves. We've got factories now all over the United States making these products. And we've developed the most advanced testing system on Earth to produce our most , and this is what we have to do: We have to produce not only cleanliness and perfection in every way, but we have to protect our most vulnerable citizens against this horrible virus. And that's, generally speaking, the elderly, especially the elderly with problems of the heart , problems with the heart, and diabetes, in particular. Those two are a basic disaster. Our strategy shelters those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to get safely back to work and to school. Instead of a never-ending blanket lockdown causing severe, long-term public health consequences, we've targeted and looked at data-driven approaches, and that's what we're doing. Again, when you close down , and we had to do it initially because it came and hit us big, hard, and nobody knew what it was, and we saved millions of lives. But today, you just pinpoint it. We know what to do and we know who to protect. As an example, very young children are incredibly powerful. They're much stronger than all of us when it comes to the immune system; it's an incredible thing to see. But we know who to protect, and we know what to do. And let me tell you: Lockdowns have big consequences in terms of drugs, in terms of family, in terms of depression and suicide, in terms of so many other problems that are caused and not good for the kids. And they don't learn the same at a computer as they do when they're in a classroom. So there are big, big problems with lockdowns. (Applause.) But we cannot defeat the virus by fighting against each other. Just can't. And there are a lot of different theories and a lot of different ways, but if you look at some of the results, you'll see some of these states, governor-run , some of the states that are open and run very smart are doing very well, and, in fact, better than strong lockdown states. Now is the time to come together as Americans and to unite against the plague inflicted upon us by China. Together, we will prevail. My second promise to you is this: We will rise from the current adversity of this horrible, invisible enemy, and we will be more prosperous and resilient than ever before. We've done things that we never knew we could do. We're building factories now. We're building plants. You'll see what's going to be happening with the job numbers very soon. We had two of the best months ever in the history of our country. And we're going to have many, many very, very successful years , unless somebody comes along and destroys it by doubling, tripling, and quadrupling your taxes, and quadrupling something else called \"regulations.\" It will be ended. It will be depression time. One of the key lessons we've learned in this battle against the China virus is that the mighty American economy has a fantastic ability to adapt and repurpose its factories. Today, using the Defense Production Act, which we've used often , remember they'd always say, \"Oh, use the Defense Production Act.\" We've used it a lot , more than some companies would like to know. We're engaged in the most rapid industrial mobilization, by far, since World War Two. Over the last six months, we've witnessed one manufacturing miracle after another. We've seen General Motors repurpose an auto parts facility in Kokomo, Indiana , a great state , and thereby stand up a ventilator , we have a ventilator factory, literally in a matter of days. And we're now producing thousands and thousands of ventilators a week. General Motors has now built and delivered more than 20,000 ventilators. By next week, our Strategic National Stockpile will be equipped to deploy more than 100,000 ventilators. They're very expensive to build. They're very complex. Very, very complex machines. And they're big. And I said that we are now supplying ventilators to many countries of the world. Everybody in our country has it. Not one person , and we had no ventilators , who knew about ventilators? We had very few. But not one person who needed a ventilator , think of this , who needed a ventilator didn't get it. Every person that needed a ventilator got it. Who would have thought that was possible? And you remember, at the very beginning, when you first heard about this whole horrible situation with the China virus, ventilators , they weren't around. And now we make them by the thousands. Working with GM and almost a dozen other companies , great companies , my administration has turned America into the ventilator king of the world. The ventilator king. (Applause.) Make them good. And we make them great. They're very good. Highest quality. We're now exporting ventilators to friends and allies, and they're really thankful. They're calling, \"Can I have ventilators for our country, sir?\" \"How many do you need?\" \"Could you send 1,000?\" I said, \"That's a lot. The answer is yes.\" What we're doing is incredible. We're helping other , we're doing more good well , will with ventilators , because other things, you can make. Gowns and swabs and things, you can make. We're making them, too. But ventilators are tough. Ventilators are just one part of our historic manufacturing ramp-up. Within seven days of New York City officials asking for assistance last spring, we helped ship a million yards of fabric from North Carolina to New York City for masks and gowns. We're making them all over the place. A great company, Honeywell, has opened up N95 respirator factories in Rhode Island and Arizona in record time, and they're now churning out tens of millions of masks for our Strategic National Stockpile. These include manufacturing achievements , and these are incredible. They'll be the foundation of an even brighter future for American industry. What we've been able to do in a short period of time is, frankly, incredible. I'm not talking about me; I'm talking about the people out there. What they've done is incredible, including the military and some of the generals and admirals , the job they've done. My third promise is to build on these gains to turn America into the premier medical manufacturer, pharmacy, and drugstore of the world. (Applause.) As we've seen in this pandemic, the United States must produce essential equipment, supplies, and pharmaceuticals for ourselves. We cannot rely on China and other nations across the globe that could one day deny us products in a time of need. We can't do it. We can't do it. We have to be smart. And speaking of pharmaceuticals, we instituted four moves , rebates, favored nations, and other things , buying from other nations where they have the product , the same exact pill, identical; made in the same factory , for a fraction , just a small fraction of the cost. We buy from other countries, as opposed to buying through this ridiculous quagmire of political scam that we've been going through for many years. And what I've done, in terms of favored nations, if , as an example, Germany has a pill for 10 cents and we have a pill for $2. We institute favored nations on the drug company. We get the pill for the same amount as the lowest pill anywhere in the world. Anywhere in the world. (Applause.) And that could drop your price of pharmaceuticals, of drugs , prescription drugs , it could drop your price 50, 60, 70 percent, maybe more than that. This is something , now, I have to tell you, I have never seen so many bad commercials about me as in the last three days since I did this. (Laughter.) So, will you remember that when you see this horrible commercial that I'm a \"socialist\" , I was called a \"socialist\" for the first time in my entire life. (Laughter.) Actually, what I am doing is I'm using socialist countries, who are buying our product for far less than we're allowed to , I'm saying, \"Well, if you're going to sell it to this country \" , might be socialist , \" for a lower price, then we're going to get that same price.\" So, you know. But I have been called everything in the book. And I say , I said, the other day, \"Whenever you see a drug company advertising that Donald Trump is a bad guy, remember: Your drug prices must be coming down very big. Very big.\" (Applause.) So please remember that. Please remember that, because I don't want to get all those negative votes, and then Biden wins, and they try , the first month, he'll say, \"I dropped drug prices 78 percent.\" And he won't even know what the hell he's saying. (Laughter and applause.) I don't want to be watching that from some beautiful resort someplace in the world. I could have , oh, I had had such a beautiful life before I did this. But that's okay because we're doing a great job and , (applause) , it makes me very happy to see people being properly representative , represented for a change. But during the course of the next four years, we will bring our pharmaceutical and medical supply chains home. We're going to bring them home where they belong. And we'll end reliance on China, just like we did with the washers and dryers, just like we did with many other things. We'll be making our product here safely, beautifully, and inexpensively. We're reasserting American economic independence. And I've been doing that from the first day I came into office. To this end, a short time ago, I signed the new executive order to ensure that when it comes to essential medicines, we buy American. (Applause.) The executive order will require that U.S. government agencies purchase all essential medicines that we need from American sources. The executive order will also sweep away unnecessary regulatory barriers to domestic pharmaceutical production and support advanced manufacturing processes that will keep our drug prices low and allow American companies to compete on the world stage. We'll be able to compete on the world stage, but we're now going to have the lowest prices, as opposed to, by far, the highest prices. I have people that I know that go to Canada , they go to Canada to buy drugs. To buy prescription drugs, they go there because the price is so much lower than the United States. And yet, it's made by the same company, often in the same plant. It's a disgrace. And the politicians allowed this to happen for many, many decades. You have people called \"middlemen.\" I don't know who the middlemen are. I don't know. They never say \"middlewomen,\" so they're politically not correct. (Laughter.) But I've heard the term \"middlemen\" for a long time. They are so wealthy. They are so wealthy. Nobody has any idea who the hell they are or what they do. They make more money than the drug companies. You know, in all fairness, at least the drug companies have to produce a product, and it has to be good product. But the middlemen , well, the rebate that I'm doing cuts out the middlemen, and it reduces costs, and the money goes back to the people purchasing the drugs. So I have a lot of enemies out there. This may be the last time you'll see me for a while. A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing. But I figure we have one chance to do it, and no other President is going to do what I do. No other President would do a favored nations, a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost. Nobody. And there are a lot of unhappy people, and they're very rich people, and they're very unhappy. Here's my fourth promise to American workers: Beyond our medical supply chains, over the next four years, we will onshore millions of new manufacturing jobs across many other critical sectors that are vital to our national security and prosperity , from electronics to machine tools, to shipping, aerospace, autos, and, of course, to iron and to steel. And we'll never forget your washers and dryers. Okay? During eight years of the last administration , (applause) , and, by the way, I have to just tell you this little story. A couple of little stories if you don't mind. Do you mind? AUDIENCE: No! THE PRESIDENT: Okay, because that's better than the other stuff, right? No, I was with somebody and they said, \"You know, for a dishwasher, we don't have enough water, sir.\" I think the , a lot of people in the audience would understand what I'm saying. They don't have enough water because they put restrictors on, so you don't have any water. And I said, \"What is that? What is that?\" In most states , I mean, outside of desert areas , we have so much water we don't know what to do with it, right? A lot of states. Your state does pretty well with the water, right? So they have plenty of water. So I passed a regulation. I signed a regulation that give the dishwashers much more water. And I was asking today , and that, by the way, includes your washers. You don't need too much water in your dryers, but it includes your washers. And I was just saying to your brilliant people that are doing such a good job running your company, I said, \"How much impact has that had?\" They said, \"Unbelievable. It's been unbelievable.\" Because I had people saying they'd wash their dishes and they would press the button five times. So in the end, they're probably wasting more water than if they did it once. So do you notice , the people that make the machines, you know what I'm talking about. We now have the water that you need , instead of stupid, where you have much less water than you need, and you just keep going over and over again. I had people say they'd press the button five times. They didn't have enough water. And the same thing with sinks, toilets, and showers. You go into a new home, you turn on the faucet; no water comes out. You turn on the shower , if you're like me, you can't wash your beautiful hair properly. (Laughter and applause). You waste 20 minutes longer. \"Please come out.\" The water , it drips, right? You know what I'm talking , they put restrictors on. I got rid of that. I signed it out. That's common sense. So now, when you actually go into a new home and pay a lot of money, you turn on the faucet, and water actually comes out. Isn't that nice? That was a regulation that was put in by a lot of people that don't understand life. Because you end up using the same amount of water; you just let it run three times longer. It's crazy. And one other thing I did: Remember the old lightbulb? The old lightbulb was so great, and they put it out of business. It was much cheaper, and it had much better light. And you're all good-looking people, but you look better under the old lightbulb than that horrible, new lightbulb. Right? It cost you a fraction of the cost. Didn't last as long, but that's okay. But it cost you a fraction. I reinstituted and opened it up so they can sell both. They can sell the new one if you want it, and they can sell the old one. The old one is doing unbe- , amazing business. Amazing business. And, you know, the new one is considered \"hazardous waste.\" When you lose it, you're supposed to take it down to a , a dump, a specified dump. How many people are going to do that with a lightbulb? \"Hey, you know, we lost this lightbulb. Let's travel 28 miles outside of the city to get rid of it.\" (Laughter.) It's hazardous waste. So I put the old bulb back in. And you can use the new one; you can use anything. I guess it's competition. But I particularly like it because I don't look so orange, so it's very nice. (Applause.) Very nice. I don't want to look , I don't like that look. Never liked it. But it's a tremendous thing, and it's having tremendous success. So they'll, you know, scoff and say, \"Oh, who cares about that.\" Very big stuff. You know, these are big things. A lot of people have come up, \"Thank you, sir.\" They had sinks that didn't give water. They had showers that didn't give water. The whole thing. And , and it's been a great thing. It's been very popular. And we might as well tell you about it, because people don't talk about it. But these are things that no other President would be doing. No other President, frankly, would be even thinking about it. During eight years of the last administration, America lost 10,000 factories and nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs , think of that. In contrast, my administration added over a half a million manufacturing jobs. It was up to actually 701,000 jobs before the plague came in. And if you remember, President Obama: \"You need a magic wand.\" No, you don't. We need manufacturing jobs. He said, \"You won't have any more manufacturing jobs. You need a magic wand.\" He was wrong about that also. My fifth promise to American workers is to bring back American jobs in factories using every tool at my disposal, including tariffs , I love properly-put-on tariffs, because they bring unfair competitors from foreign countries to do whatever you want them to do , countervailing duties, and new trade deals based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. And I'll be signing something very important. Watch over the next week. I think you'll be very proud of your President. I'm going to be signing something that's very important over the next, probably, week. And it'll have a tremendous impact on fairness and trade. As part of this commitment, earlier today I signed a proclamation that defends American industry by re-imposing aluminum tariffs on Canada. Canada was taking advantage of us, as usual, and I signed it, and it imposes , because the aluminum business was being decimated by Canada. Very unfair to our jobs and our great aluminum workers. Several months ago, my administration agreed to lift those tariffs in return for a promise from the Canadian government that its aluminum industry would not flood our country with exports and kill all our aluminum jobs, which is exactly what they did. Canadian aluminum producers have broken that commitment, and the U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, has advised me that this step to re-impose tariffs is absolutely necessary to defend our aluminum industry. To be a strong nation, America must be a manufacturing nation and not be led by a bunch of fools. That means protecting our national industrial base. We have to protect our great companies and our great workers. My sixth and final promise today is to forever uphold the commitment I made from the beginning: I will always put American workers first. Always. They'll always be put first. (Applause.) And I don't know if you're union or nonunion , it doesn't matter to me , but I did one hell of a good job for the unions. You know, all the union heads are against me, but all the workers are for me, so something is right. The workers are for me. (Applause.) They usually , the union heads , they're wined and dined in Washington pretty good by the Democrats. As part of this commitment, on Monday, I signed an executive order to prevent government agencies, like the Tennessee Valley Authority, from replacing American workers with cheap foreign labor. There's a very big utility run by a man that gets $8 million a year. Would anybody in this room like that job? Eight million. Eight million a year, right? Highest-paid , he's really , he doesn't work for me; I wouldn't pay $8 million. If you paid him , the President gets $400- , $450,000. I give up my salary. Nobody ever says that. I might as well, every once in a while, say it. I believe I'm the only President to do that. And I'm saying, \"That's not too smart.\" But the Tennessee Valley Authority pays $8 million a year to the head. And after the Authority laid off 20 percent of its American technology workforce and forced them to train their foreign replacements this week, I told the chairman of the board, \"You're fired.\" (Applause.) And the firings will continue unless the layoffs are reversed and the American workers are rehired. And, by the way, as I was leaving for the great state of Ohio , did you ever watch Biden, where he's always saying the wrong state? \"It's great to be in Florida. Florida.\" \"No, it's Ohio.\" I've never seen a guy , I haven't done that one yet; that's a disaster. I always say , Jim Jordan , if you do that, it's over, right? You can be Winston Churchill. The speeches is over; you just walk off the stage. But he does it all the time. Nobody calls him for it. \"I love the state of Iowa.\" \"Sir, sir, it's Idaho. It's Idaho.\" And the worst is when he's in, like, Indiana, and he says, \"It's great to be with the people of Florida,\" and you have palm trees all over the place. But he does it all the time. There's something going on. But over the last four years, we've made extraordinary strides, and over the next four years together, we will turn the United States into the unrivaled manufacturing superpower of the world. We've been through a lot together. (Applause.) They've done everything possible to get in my way. They've treated us very unfairly, disgracefully, with what they've done to us. And despite what they've done, no administration in the history of this country has done more in the first three and a half years than we have , whether it's rebuilding our military , (applause) , all made in the USA; whether it's the biggest tax cuts in history; whether it's the biggest regulation cuts in history; ANWR in Alaska, the largest field, perhaps, in the world that Ronald Reagan , going back even before Ronald Reagan, no President could get it approved. I got it approved, and now it's potentially one of the greatest sites in the world. Should be the greatest site in the world. So many different things we've done. We've done so much. What we've done for our vets , and you're a big vet state. Ohio loves its vets and what we've done for our vets , (applause) , Choice and Accountability. We got two things. They've been trying for almost 50 years , Choice. Veterans Choice. How about that? We got that for you. So if you have to wait on line for two days or two weeks or two months , and they had to wait two months sometimes. If they had to wait on line, they don't anymore. They go outside, they get a private doctor, we approve it, we pay the bill. And we take care of our vets like they're supposed to be taken care of. Just got a 91 percent approval rating. (Applause.) The VA just got a 91 percent approval rating , highest ever. The highest it's ever had. And Accountability , we have people that are so , were so scornful, they had hatred for our vets. They were treating our vets badly. Our vets have to be treated great. But you couldn't fire them. They could be sadistic, they could be thieves, they could be , you couldn't fire them because of civil service unions, et cetera. You know. Couldn't fire them. And I got the Accountability , VA Accountability. Now you look at them, they don't do a good job for our vets, you say, \"Jim, you're fired.\" Boom. \"Get out.\" That's the story. (Applause.) We actually terminated over 8,000 people that were not treating our vets well, and they were there for a long time. And it sounds a little bit cold, but the truth is they got to treat our vets well, right? So they have to do it. But we got Accountability and we got VA Choice. But to achieve the vision that we've been talking about for so long, we must finish the job and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And we're doing it. (Applause.) For years, left-wing politicians smiled and looked at American workers right in the eye and took advantage of them and lied to them. They took your endorsements, they took your money, and they took your votes, and they did nothing. Then they turned around and inflicted one corrupt betrayal of the American middle class after another, whether it was NAFTA, TPP, the horrible Korea deal, the ridiculous Paris Climate Accord , how's it working out for Paris? Not so good. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization, which is probably the worst of all the deals, if you want to know the truth. That was where China signed that and they went up like a rocket ship. And they violated the rules like nobody has ever violated them before. In fact, they're considered a developing nation. And because they're a developing nation, they have advantages. Well, we didn't accept that. But for years, they accepted that. And, by the way, Joe Biden supported every single one of those horrible, disastrous sellouts. Under this administration, those days have been over, and we're not going back. We're respected again as a country. You know, we're respected again. You may not feel it, although I think you do. You may not see it. You don't read about it from the fake news, but this country is respected again. We don't let people take advantage of us, including our allies, who took tremendous advantage of us. Tremendous. (Applause.) Our allies took tremendous advantage of us both militarily, where they don't pay their bills. We protect them, they don't pay , like Germany, we're reducing the force. They don't pay. They're delinquent. I say it all the time. They're delinquent. They got to pay. You know, we protect Germany from Russia, and yet, Germany is paying billions of dollars a year , billions and billions to Russia for energy. So I say, \"What's that all about?\" So we protect, and they pay money, and we protect. So we don't stand for things like that, but we have many other things. I could stand up here all day long and tell you things that you wouldn't even believe. To fully restore American prosperity, we must stop the radical left-wing movement that would destroy our country. They want to impose $3 trillion of new taxes on American families. They want to ban fracking, which will demolish your state. It will demolish Ohio oil and gas jobs. They want to rejoin the disastrous Paris Climate Accord, where you'll pay billions and billions of dollars for the privilege of getting ripped off by other countries; and inflict a socialist takeover of the U.S. economy, known as the horrendous Green New Deal. It was conceived by a young woman, AOC , AOC plus three, I say. AOC , that's a real beauty isn't it? She knows as much about the environment , do we have any young children here? , as that young child over there. I think he knows more. (Laughter.) And she certainly knows nothing about the economy. And if they ever had their chance, you would find that out, and it wouldn't take very long. You know, Venezuela was a very wealthy country 20 years ago , one of the wealthiest , per capita, one of the wealthiest. Tremendous oil reserves, everything. Now they don't have food. They don't have water. They don't have medicine, they don't have anything. Same thing could happen, same or similar ideology. They also want to throw open American borders, give free taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens, defund police, abolish ICE, abolish borders , no more borders , and abolish basically the American Dream. This is Joe Biden. And does anybody really think he's strong enough to stand up to these ruthless, vicious people? You look at , you look at Portland, you look at what's going on in Seattle, these are the people that you're dealing with. If I didn't send in the troops, if I didn't send in the great people from Homeland Security, you'd have courthouses and post offices and everything else burned down, blown up. And we may send in something else because you know what? They've been riding now for 70 days and the mayor thinks it's just wonderful, and the governor has no idea what she's doing. I've never seen people like this. Remember, in Seattle, where they took over a big chunk of the city? Seattle. And the mayor said, \"It's going to be a Summer of Love.\" And I said, \"She's just kidding, right? Isn't she?\" She wasn't kidding. But we were all set to send in the troops, send in the people that we were going to send in. And what happened is amazing. We told them, and all of a sudden, the police went out and they cleaned it up. But that place would still be occupied if we didn't get involved. Same thing with Minneapolis. Minneapolis was a disaster. After five or six days, they were going to lose that whole city. We sent in the National Guard. They took care of things in about one hour. Remember the scene of them walking down the street, firing the tear gas? Now you're not even allowed , if you're looking at the other side, you're not allowed to use tear gas or pepper spray. You can't use any of that stuff. They can use Molotov cocktails and horrible things on you, but you're not allowed to do anything. So the police didn't want to have anything to do with the convention in a great state, Wisconsin , Milwaukee , for the Democrats. You couldn't use tear gas. You couldn't use pepper spray. You couldn't use anything. Think of how ridiculous this is. And you won't be able to use your guns because they're going to end your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. But the proud people of Ohio will not let that happen. Together, we will preserve, protect, and defend our American way of life. As long as I am President , (applause) , thank you. Thank you. As long as I am President of the United States, I will fight for you with every ounce of energy and strength that I have. I will be your voice. I will defend your jobs. I will stand up to the foreign trade cheaters and violators that hate our country. I will never let you down. I will have your back, 100 percent. For more than a century, the workers of this company have continued the proud tradition of American greatness embodied by your legendary founder, Lou Upton. It's a heritage grounded in the values of hard work and determination, innovation and excellence, faith and family, loyalty and patriotism passed down from one generation to the next. You have an incredible heritage. These are the values that have defined this company and defined our country from the very beginning, and they are the values that will define our future, that will ensure our success, and that will allow America to thrive and win for many generations to come. There is nobody that can defeat us. Nobody. Now I'd like to take just a moment to introduce a few of the Whirlpool men and women whose jobs I had the honor of taking decisive action to protect and to save. Keri Wallace is an operations analyst whose family has 100 years of history at this very plant. Keri, please come forward and say a few words. Please. (Applause.) Thank you, Keri. MS. WALLACE: Good afternoon. Manufacturing is the heartbeat of this area. Whirlpool has an enormous impact on the state of Ohio, economically. My family has probably worked in these walls for four generations, like Mr. President said, for combined over 100 years. I had the opportunity to get some advice from my mother , advice that was passed down from my grandfather, which I was actually just able to pass down to my nephew: \"There is not another company that would provide financial security and career opportunities in this area like Whirlpool.\" It's true; the opportunities here are endless for us. Whirlpool has rewarded me with a completely new family also. I work with 3,500 proud individuals. Together, we build American-made, quality products here in Clyde. We bleed Whirlpool blue. I'm grateful for the support that we received in 2018 from the President. That support gives us the ability to compete and deliver in the marketplace now and for many generations to come. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you, Keri. Wow. Great job. Marco Ontiveros is a first-generation American who started at this plant to support his family 17 years ago. Marco rose through leadership to become a production lead. Marco, please come up and say a few words, please. (Applause.) MR. ONTIVEROS: Thank you, Mr. President. As the President said, I started here about 16, going on 17 years. I was fresh out of high school. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. But I knew I had two young children that I had to support, and I had to support fast. I'm honored to say that I found that, here at Whirlpool, within these four walls, I have been able to not only provide, but continue to develop myself into a career path that I never would've dreamed of when I was 18 years old coming out of there. As Ms. Wallace stated, I, too, am very grateful for the tariffs that were put against our foreign competitors in 2018 to take that instability away from our everyday life and provide a longevity of stability and support for these American jobs here in these four walls. As our President said, I am a first-generation from an immigrant family. My father was an immigrant. He came here to chase the American Dream, and I can say I'm fortunate enough to find my American Dream within these four walls here at Whirlpool. Thank you very much. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you both. And, you know, Marco had a beautiful speech written, and he never looked down. You never even looked down at that speech. (Laughter.) I'm , I'm impressed. With both of you, I'm impressed. To every worker here at Whirlpool, thank you once again for welcoming us. It's an honor to be here. And thank you for your commitment to American manufacturing. You're a great company with great, great people. Together, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our factories, and we will bring back our American Dream. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) END 4:25 P.M.

I've been very good to you. We've been good to each other. With the incredible men and women of Whirlpool, the largest washing machine factory anywhere in the world. Every day, 20,000 gleaming new machines coming rolling off that beautiful assembly line , I just got to see it , and every single one is proudly inscribed with that glorious phrase, 'Made in the USA.' Remember? (Applause.) Made in the USA. When I was campaigning, I said, 'Let's go. 'Made in the USA.' Put it on your machines. Put it on everything we make.' I'm grateful to everyone at Whirlpool for welcoming us today, including Marc Bitzer , thank you , Jim Keppler and Sarah Bovim. Thank you very much. Sarah? Where's Sarah? Thank you. Thank you very much. Sarah Bovim. Also with us today is Secretary of Labor Gene Scalia and a warrior , I'm sure you never heard of him; he's a warrior, a great, great wrestling champion and a great guy: Jim Jordan. (Applause.) Jim. He is a warrior. Thanks, Jim. And he's tough. I'm not going to wrestle him ever. I promise. And another warrior , a great fellow who has been right at our side. He works with Jim and I so much and so hard: Bob Latta. Bob. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you, Bob. Also, Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted. Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Jon. (Applause.) Thank you. State Senate President Larry Obhof. Larry, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you, Larry. Thank you, Larry. Clyde Mayor Scott Black and many other distinguished guests. Great people. (Applause.) Great representatives. Thank you, fellas. Thank you very much. As we celebrate Whirlpool's 109-year legacy of American manufacturing excellence, today I want to lay out my vision to bring millions and millions more jobs and thousands more factories back to American shores where they belong. We've been doing it long and hard. One of the reasons you're successful today happens to be a meeting I had probably four years ago with a very good representative of your company, saying what they were doing to you and how badly you were being treated by other countries. And you know what I did. And here we are today, the most successful plant. (Applause.) And we've done this in a lot of places. The duty of a President is to put this nation's own citizens first. That's why my administration swears by two simple but crucial rules: Buy American and Hire American. (Applause.) And no one knows better than the workers of Whirlpool the high cost of past administrations' economic blunders and surrender. On the question of foreign trade, previous leaders were guided by a shameful policy of capitulation, submission, and retreat. For decades, you watched as politicians let foreign nations steal our jobs, loot our factories, and plunder the crown jewels of the U.S. economy. And the word 'plunder' is capitalized. Washington stood idly by as other countries engaged in unfair trade practices, such as massive subsidies, currency manipulation, and in the case of your industry and your company, the wholesale dumping of foreign-made products sold below cost for the sole purpose of driving you out of business so they could give us product at double, triple, and quadruple the price. But we didn't let that happen, did we? (Applause.) For eight years, Whirlpool begged the Obama-Biden administration, who did nothing, to protect American workers from the flagrant dumping of foreign washers, dryers into America. But your cries for help fell on deaf ears. You didn't see any action. They didn't act. They didn't care, and they never will. For eight long years under Obama-Biden administration, American factory workers received nothing but broken promises and brazen sellouts and lost jobs. The last administration tied America up in one globalist debacle after another. They catered to the special interests while allowing foreign nations to siphon off our wealth, our dignity, our dreams, our money. The suffering of our workers was met with nothing but cruel betrayal and callous indifference. In 2013, the U.S. International Trade Commission found your competitors from Korea and other countries guilty of dumping washers into the U.S. market and ordered them to pay anti-dumping duties as high as 79 percent. But rather than pay these very high tariffs, LG and Samsung relocated production to another country , a country called China. Have you ever heard of it? And the last administration did nothing as they kept on dumping washers into the U.S. market with impunity. The Obama-Biden administration was laughed at. They were a joke. And they were perfectly happy to let China win, your jobs disappear, and your factory to close. And you know what it was like. I came through today, and everybody was out there. Tremendous crowds, waving and cheering. I said, 'I must have done it right,' because you had people that were really , really something. (Applause.) Because four or five years ago, this place was a disaster. In 2017, Whirlpool won relief from the ITC once again. Once more, your foreign competitors moved their factories to prevent a level playing field and to avoid liability, shifting production to Th-ailand and to Vietnam , Thailand and Vietnam, two places that I like their leaders very much. They're very nice to us. Do they take advantage of the United States? Not so much anymore. But this time, there was one big difference: Instead of an administration that sold out American workers and sold your company out and couldn't have cared less for you, you finally had a president who stood up for the American worker. On January 23rd, 2018, at my desk in the Oval Office, I proudly signed the order to impose a 50 percent tariff on all foreign-made washing machines. (Applause.) As a result, Whirlpool's nine factories across the United States were soon thriving like never before, investing in new products, new infrastructure, and hundreds of new American jobs. And I just took a tour, and I actually wanted a couple of those machines for myself , (laughter) , but I just didn't know it was going to be appropriate to ask. But they are beautiful. That includes thousands of new jobs across the Ohio supply chain, from right here in Clyde to Findlay, Ottawa, Greenville, and Marion. (Applause.) All over. Your company became a shining example. From, really, a company that was down and out, it became a shining example of what tough trade policies and smart tariffs can bring to , jobs and prosperity to communities like this one all over Ohio Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and plenty of other states. They're all doing well. They were doing great. Then the plague came in, and now they're doing great again. We closed it up; we saved millions of lives. But now we're opening, and it looks like I was right about the 'V,' because you're seeing the kind of numbers that are coming in, and they're coming in strong. They're coming in strong. (Applause.) Should have never happened. Should have never happened. China should have never let it happen. In defending your jobs here at Whirlpool, I was doing exactly what I promised in June 2016. As a candidate for President, I stood before an audience of hardworking patriots at a metals processing facility outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to outline my plan for a new America First trade policy. And it was even a better job than I told you. I'm one politician that says 'I'm going to do this,' and then we do better. We produced more than I promised. And, by the way, the wall is being built. It's going to be finished very soon. (Applause.) In my speech, I warned that our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization , moving our jobs, our wealth, and our factories overseas. I explained that globalization , these are the globalists. I'm not liking globalists too much, but they don't like me too much either. Globalization has made the financial elites, who donate to politicians, very wealthy, but it's left millions and millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache, and our towns and cities with empty factories and plants. For years later, we've made extraordinary progress in reversing the dangerous tide of globalism; over a period of four to five years, this took place. Think of it: four to five years. What we've done is a miracle, and now it's getting even better because we've taken additional steps. And, you know, when you do these steps, you have to go through statutory procedures. It's not like, 'Boom, I'm going to just sign it.' It has to go out for 90 days of review, then 120 days of review, then more. And we did it as quick as we can. We're doing it right now, with the FDA; we're getting vaccines approved in days that nobody thought possible. It would take years and years, and we're doing it in months, and we're doing very well. Under my administration, we're fighting for Main Street, not Wall Street. We have rejected globalism and embraced patriotism. In my speech in Pittsburgh, in June of 2016, I made seven big promises to American workers. Many politicians before me promised change on the campaign trail, only to back down in the face of corporate and international pressure. Like Jerusalem. They all promised Jerusalem , didn't they? , for years and years. I did it; they didn't do it. They didn't do it. I did it. (Applause.) Moved the embassy to Jerusalem, making Jerusalem the capital of Israel. They all talked about it. They talked and talked and talked, and then they got into office, and they didn't do it. And I understand why: The pressure was enormous. On me, too. I just didn't take the phone calls. That's true. Leaders would call up from other countries. I'd say, 'I know what they're calling about. I'll call them back in a few days.' Then I just signed all the papers, got it done, and then I called them back. And they said, 'I was calling about Israel and Jerusalem, but you've already done it.' I said, 'That's right.' And they said, 'Oh, okay.' (Laughter.) I said, 'Hey, I wish you got me a little bit earlier.' (Laughter and applause.) But I didn't back down from my promises, and I've kept every single one. First, I promised to withdraw the United States from the last administration's disastrous assault on U.S. workers: the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It would have been a disaster. It would have been a disaster, especially for the automobile industry. It would have put it out of business. My first week in office, I kept that promise and canceled that job-killing catastrophe. Second, I pledged to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to defend American jobs, and I did with Bob Lighthizer and all of his people. They've been fantastic. Third, I said I would use every legal tool at my disposal to fight back against unfair trade, and I did. And I found some that nobody even knew about. Some of them were very old. They had a lot of dust on them. Hadn't been used for decades and decades. But I found them , things you could never get passed today. Fourth, I promised to label China a 'currency manipulator,' and I did. Fifth, I said we would bring trade cases against China to crack down on its economic aggression. Sixth, I committed to impose tariffs on goods to protect American jobs and stop China and many other countries' abuses under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. As your President, I have kept every single one of these pledges to the American people and to the American worker, without exception. Every one has been done. (Applause.) Seventh, one of my biggest promises in that speech was to replace the disaster known as NAFTA , one of the worst trade deals ever made by any country, let alone ours. Ohio lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed. Half of all of the automaking jobs across the state were wiped out. Earlier this year, I finally ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand-new USMCA agreement. That's United States and Mexico and Canada. And all of those bad things that you had to suffer with, you're not suffering anymore, because now people and companies have an incentive to stay. They're not going to be leaving so fast. (Applause.) That was the biggest point I made. I want to make sure that these companies aren't leaving. And the managers walk up, and they say, 'I'm sorry, our company is leaving and going to Mexico' , or Canada , but going, primarily, in that case, to Mexico. Canada takes advantage of us with dairy , unbelievable advantage , but not anymore. But Mexico took a lot of jobs. And I said, 'I don't want companies moving. And if they do move ' Remember? You've heard it. 'If they do move when they make that product, they got to pay a big price to sell it back into our country.' So they have no more incentive to move. The USMCA contains powerful new protections for American manufacturers, automakers, farmers, dairy producers, and workers all across Ohio and all of our states. Those were key promises I made to American workers in 2016; I kept every single one of them. The fake news media back there, they hate to report this. They hate it. (Applause.) Why do they hate it? Because they're fake. Today, to define our path forward, I'm making our incredible workers six more promises that I will keep over the next four years, and I'm very proud to make them at your plant and in the state of Ohio. First and foremost, we will defeat the China virus. We're working very, very hard. We call it the 'China virus.' We call it the 'invisible enemy.' We call it many different names. It's got many different names, but it's bad. And we've made tremendous strides. We're attacking the virus from every angle. And through this aggressive strategy, we will win the war, and it will happen sooner than people think. We're developing a bounty of therapies such as remdesivir, dexamethasone, antibody treatments , the antibody treatments are really working out well, really well , and many more that have allowed us to reduce mortality by 85 percent since April. Under Operation Warp Speed, two vaccines are already in the final stage of clinical trials. And we'll have a vaccine very soon , I hope long before the end of the year. We've dramatically increased our domestic production of personal protective equipment, such as N95 respirators, gowns, and gloves. We've got factories now all over the United States making these products. And we've developed the most advanced testing system on Earth to produce our most , and this is what we have to do: We have to produce not only cleanliness and perfection in every way, but we have to protect our most vulnerable citizens against this horrible virus. And that's, generally speaking, the elderly, especially the elderly with problems of the heart , problems with the heart, and diabetes, in particular. Those two are a basic disaster. Our strategy shelters those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to get safely back to work and to school. Instead of a never-ending blanket lockdown causing severe, long-term public health consequences, we've targeted and looked at data-driven approaches, and that's what we're doing. Again, when you close down , and we had to do it initially because it came and hit us big, hard, and nobody knew what it was, and we saved millions of lives. But today, you just pinpoint it. We know what to do and we know who to protect. As an example, very young children are incredibly powerful. They're much stronger than all of us when it comes to the immune system; it's an incredible thing to see. But we know who to protect, and we know what to do. And let me tell you: Lockdowns have big consequences in terms of drugs, in terms of family, in terms of depression and suicide, in terms of so many other problems that are caused and not good for the kids. And they don't learn the same at a computer as they do when they're in a classroom. So there are big, big problems with lockdowns. (Applause.) But we cannot defeat the virus by fighting against each other. Just can't. And there are a lot of different theories and a lot of different ways, but if you look at some of the results, you'll see some of these states, governor-run , some of the states that are open and run very smart are doing very well, and, in fact, better than strong lockdown states. Now is the time to come together as Americans and to unite against the plague inflicted upon us by China. Together, we will prevail. My second promise to you is this: We will rise from the current adversity of this horrible, invisible enemy, and we will be more prosperous and resilient than ever before. We've done things that we never knew we could do. We're building factories now. We're building plants. You'll see what's going to be happening with the job numbers very soon. We had two of the best months ever in the history of our country. And we're going to have many, many very, very successful years , unless somebody comes along and destroys it by doubling, tripling, and quadrupling your taxes, and quadrupling something else called 'regulations.' It will be ended. It will be depression time. One of the key lessons we've learned in this battle against the China virus is that the mighty American economy has a fantastic ability to adapt and repurpose its factories. Today, using the Defense Production Act, which we've used often , remember they'd always say, 'Oh, use the Defense Production Act.' We've used it a lot , more than some companies would like to know. We're engaged in the most rapid industrial mobilization, by far, since World War Two. Over the last six months, we've witnessed one manufacturing miracle after another. We've seen General Motors repurpose an auto parts facility in Kokomo, Indiana , a great state , and thereby stand up a ventilator , we have a ventilator factory, literally in a matter of days. And we're now producing thousands and thousands of ventilators a week. General Motors has now built and delivered more than 20,000 ventilators. By next week, our Strategic National Stockpile will be equipped to deploy more than 100,000 ventilators. They're very expensive to build. They're very complex. Very, very complex machines. And they're big. And I said that we are now supplying ventilators to many countries of the world. Everybody in our country has it. Not one person , and we had no ventilators , who knew about ventilators? We had very few. But not one person who needed a ventilator , think of this , who needed a ventilator didn't get it. Every person that needed a ventilator got it. Who would have thought that was possible? And you remember, at the very beginning, when you first heard about this whole horrible situation with the China virus, ventilators , they weren't around. And now we make them by the thousands. Working with GM and almost a dozen other companies , great companies , my administration has turned America into the ventilator king of the world. The ventilator king. (Applause.) Make them good. And we make them great. They're very good. Highest quality. We're now exporting ventilators to friends and allies, and they're really thankful. They're calling, 'Can I have ventilators for our country, sir?' 'How many do you need?' 'Could you send 1,000?' I said, 'That's a lot. The answer is yes.' What we're doing is incredible. We're helping other , we're doing more good well , will with ventilators , because other things, you can make. Gowns and swabs and things, you can make. We're making them, too. But ventilators are tough. Ventilators are just one part of our historic manufacturing ramp-up. Within seven days of New York City officials asking for assistance last spring, we helped ship a million yards of fabric from North Carolina to New York City for masks and gowns. We're making them all over the place. A great company, Honeywell, has opened up N95 respirator factories in Rhode Island and Arizona in record time, and they're now churning out tens of millions of masks for our Strategic National Stockpile. These include manufacturing achievements , and these are incredible. They'll be the foundation of an even brighter future for American industry. What we've been able to do in a short period of time is, frankly, incredible. I'm not talking about me; I'm talking about the people out there. What they've done is incredible, including the military and some of the generals and admirals , the job they've done. My third promise is to build on these gains to turn America into the premier medical manufacturer, pharmacy, and drugstore of the world. (Applause.) As we've seen in this pandemic, the United States must produce essential equipment, supplies, and pharmaceuticals for ourselves. We cannot rely on China and other nations across the globe that could one day deny us products in a time of need. We can't do it. We can't do it. We have to be smart. And speaking of pharmaceuticals, we instituted four moves , rebates, favored nations, and other things , buying from other nations where they have the product , the same exact pill, identical; made in the same factory , for a fraction , just a small fraction of the cost. We buy from other countries, as opposed to buying through this ridiculous quagmire of political scam that we've been going through for many years. And what I've done, in terms of favored nations, if , as an example, Germany has a pill for 10 cents and we have a pill for $2. We institute favored nations on the drug company. We get the pill for the same amount as the lowest pill anywhere in the world. Anywhere in the world. (Applause.) And that could drop your price of pharmaceuticals, of drugs , prescription drugs , it could drop your price 50, 60, 70 percent, maybe more than that. This is something , now, I have to tell you, I have never seen so many bad commercials about me as in the last three days since I did this. (Laughter.) So, will you remember that when you see this horrible commercial that I'm a 'socialist' , I was called a 'socialist' for the first time in my entire life. (Laughter.) Actually, what I am doing is I'm using socialist countries, who are buying our product for far less than we're allowed to , I'm saying, 'Well, if you're going to sell it to this country ' , might be socialist , ' for a lower price, then we're going to get that same price.' So, you know. But I have been called everything in the book. And I say , I said, the other day, 'Whenever you see a drug company advertising that Donald Trump is a bad guy, remember: Your drug prices must be coming down very big. Very big.' (Applause.) So please remember that. Please remember that, because I don't want to get all those negative votes, and then Biden wins, and they try , the first month, he'll say, 'I dropped drug prices 78 percent.' And he won't even know what the hell he's saying. (Laughter and applause.) I don't want to be watching that from some beautiful resort someplace in the world. I could have , oh, I had had such a beautiful life before I did this. But that's okay because we're doing a great job and , (applause) , it makes me very happy to see people being properly representative , represented for a change. But during the course of the next four years, we will bring our pharmaceutical and medical supply chains home. We're going to bring them home where they belong. And we'll end reliance on China, just like we did with the washers and dryers, just like we did with many other things. We'll be making our product here safely, beautifully, and inexpensively. We're reasserting American economic independence. And I've been doing that from the first day I came into office. To this end, a short time ago, I signed the new executive order to ensure that when it comes to essential medicines, we buy American. (Applause.) The executive order will require that U.S. government agencies purchase all essential medicines that we need from American sources. The executive order will also sweep away unnecessary regulatory barriers to domestic pharmaceutical production and support advanced manufacturing processes that will keep our drug prices low and allow American companies to compete on the world stage. We'll be able to compete on the world stage, but we're now going to have the lowest prices, as opposed to, by far, the highest prices. I have people that I know that go to Canada , they go to Canada to buy drugs. To buy prescription drugs, they go there because the price is so much lower than the United States. And yet, it's made by the same company, often in the same plant. It's a disgrace. And the politicians allowed this to happen for many, many decades. You have people called 'middlemen.' I don't know who the middlemen are. I don't know. They never say 'middlewomen,' so they're politically not correct. (Laughter.) But I've heard the term 'middlemen' for a long time. They are so wealthy. They are so wealthy. Nobody has any idea who the hell they are or what they do. They make more money than the drug companies. You know, in all fairness, at least the drug companies have to produce a product, and it has to be good product. But the middlemen , well, the rebate that I'm doing cuts out the middlemen, and it reduces costs, and the money goes back to the people purchasing the drugs. So I have a lot of enemies out there. This may be the last time you'll see me for a while. A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing. But I figure we have one chance to do it, and no other President is going to do what I do. No other President would do a favored nations, a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost. Nobody. And there are a lot of unhappy people, and they're very rich people, and they're very unhappy. Here's my fourth promise to American workers: Beyond our medical supply chains, over the next four years, we will onshore millions of new manufacturing jobs across many other critical sectors that are vital to our national security and prosperity , from electronics to machine tools, to shipping, aerospace, autos, and, of course, to iron and to steel. And we'll never forget your washers and dryers. Okay? During eight years of the last administration , (applause) , and, by the way, I have to just tell you this little story. A couple of little stories if you don't mind. Do you mind? Okay, because that's better than the other stuff, right? No, I was with somebody and they said, 'You know, for a dishwasher, we don't have enough water, sir.' I think the , a lot of people in the audience would understand what I'm saying. They don't have enough water because they put restrictors on, so you don't have any water. And I said, 'What is that? What is that?' In most states , I mean, outside of desert areas , we have so much water we don't know what to do with it, right? A lot of states. Your state does pretty well with the water, right? So they have plenty of water. So I passed a regulation. I signed a regulation that give the dishwashers much more water. And I was asking today , and that, by the way, includes your washers. You don't need too much water in your dryers, but it includes your washers. And I was just saying to your brilliant people that are doing such a good job running your company, I said, 'How much impact has that had?' They said, 'Unbelievable. It's been unbelievable.' Because I had people saying they'd wash their dishes and they would press the button five times. So in the end, they're probably wasting more water than if they did it once. So do you notice , the people that make the machines, you know what I'm talking about. We now have the water that you need , instead of stupid, where you have much less water than you need, and you just keep going over and over again. I had people say they'd press the button five times. They didn't have enough water. And the same thing with sinks, toilets, and showers. You go into a new home, you turn on the faucet; no water comes out. You turn on the shower , if you're like me, you can't wash your beautiful hair properly. (Laughter and applause). You waste 20 minutes longer. 'Please come out.' The water , it drips, right? You know what I'm talking , they put restrictors on. I got rid of that. I signed it out. That's common sense. So now, when you actually go into a new home and pay a lot of money, you turn on the faucet, and water actually comes out. Isn't that nice? That was a regulation that was put in by a lot of people that don't understand life. Because you end up using the same amount of water; you just let it run three times longer. It's crazy. And one other thing I did: Remember the old lightbulb? The old lightbulb was so great, and they put it out of business. It was much cheaper, and it had much better light. And you're all good-looking people, but you look better under the old lightbulb than that horrible, new lightbulb. Right? It cost you a fraction of the cost. Didn't last as long, but that's okay. But it cost you a fraction. I reinstituted and opened it up so they can sell both. They can sell the new one if you want it, and they can sell the old one. The old one is doing unbe- , amazing business. Amazing business. And, you know, the new one is considered 'hazardous waste.' When you lose it, you're supposed to take it down to a , a dump, a specified dump. How many people are going to do that with a lightbulb? 'Hey, you know, we lost this lightbulb. Let's travel 28 miles outside of the city to get rid of it.' (Laughter.) It's hazardous waste. So I put the old bulb back in. And you can use the new one; you can use anything. I guess it's competition. But I particularly like it because I don't look so orange, so it's very nice. (Applause.) Very nice. I don't want to look , I don't like that look. Never liked it. But it's a tremendous thing, and it's having tremendous success. So they'll, you know, scoff and say, 'Oh, who cares about that.' Very big stuff. You know, these are big things. A lot of people have come up, 'Thank you, sir.' They had sinks that didn't give water. They had showers that didn't give water. The whole thing. And , and it's been a great thing. It's been very popular. And we might as well tell you about it, because people don't talk about it. But these are things that no other President would be doing. No other President, frankly, would be even thinking about it. During eight years of the last administration, America lost 10,000 factories and nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs , think of that. In contrast, my administration added over a half a million manufacturing jobs. It was up to actually 701,000 jobs before the plague came in. And if you remember, President Obama: 'You need a magic wand.' No, you don't. We need manufacturing jobs. He said, 'You won't have any more manufacturing jobs. You need a magic wand.' He was wrong about that also. My fifth promise to American workers is to bring back American jobs in factories using every tool at my disposal, including tariffs , I love properly-put-on tariffs, because they bring unfair competitors from foreign countries to do whatever you want them to do , countervailing duties, and new trade deals based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. And I'll be signing something very important. Watch over the next week. I think you'll be very proud of your President. I'm going to be signing something that's very important over the next, probably, week. And it'll have a tremendous impact on fairness and trade. As part of this commitment, earlier today I signed a proclamation that defends American industry by re-imposing aluminum tariffs on Canada. Canada was taking advantage of us, as usual, and I signed it, and it imposes , because the aluminum business was being decimated by Canada. Very unfair to our jobs and our great aluminum workers. Several months ago, my administration agreed to lift those tariffs in return for a promise from the Canadian government that its aluminum industry would not flood our country with exports and kill all our aluminum jobs, which is exactly what they did. Canadian aluminum producers have broken that commitment, and the U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, has advised me that this step to re-impose tariffs is absolutely necessary to defend our aluminum industry. To be a strong nation, America must be a manufacturing nation and not be led by a bunch of fools. That means protecting our national industrial base. We have to protect our great companies and our great workers. My sixth and final promise today is to forever uphold the commitment I made from the beginning: I will always put American workers first. Always. They'll always be put first. (Applause.) And I don't know if you're union or nonunion , it doesn't matter to me , but I did one hell of a good job for the unions. You know, all the union heads are against me, but all the workers are for me, so something is right. The workers are for me. (Applause.) They usually , the union heads , they're wined and dined in Washington pretty good by the Democrats. As part of this commitment, on Monday, I signed an executive order to prevent government agencies, like the Tennessee Valley Authority, from replacing American workers with cheap foreign labor. There's a very big utility run by a man that gets $8 million a year. Would anybody in this room like that job? Eight million. Eight million a year, right? Highest-paid , he's really , he doesn't work for me; I wouldn't pay $8 million. If you paid him , the President gets $400- , $450,000. I give up my salary. Nobody ever says that. I might as well, every once in a while, say it. I believe I'm the only President to do that. And I'm saying, 'That's not too smart.' But the Tennessee Valley Authority pays $8 million a year to the head. And after the Authority laid off 20 percent of its American technology workforce and forced them to train their foreign replacements this week, I told the chairman of the board, 'You're fired.' (Applause.) And the firings will continue unless the layoffs are reversed and the American workers are rehired. And, by the way, as I was leaving for the great state of Ohio , did you ever watch Biden, where he's always saying the wrong state? 'It's great to be in Florida. Florida.' 'No, it's Ohio.' I've never seen a guy , I haven't done that one yet; that's a disaster. I always say , Jim Jordan , if you do that, it's over, right? You can be Winston Churchill. The speeches is over; you just walk off the stage. But he does it all the time. Nobody calls him for it. 'I love the state of Iowa.' 'Sir, sir, it's Idaho. It's Idaho.' And the worst is when he's in, like, Indiana, and he says, 'It's great to be with the people of Florida,' and you have palm trees all over the place. But he does it all the time. There's something going on. But over the last four years, we've made extraordinary strides, and over the next four years together, we will turn the United States into the unrivaled manufacturing superpower of the world. We've been through a lot together. (Applause.) They've done everything possible to get in my way. They've treated us very unfairly, disgracefully, with what they've done to us. And despite what they've done, no administration in the history of this country has done more in the first three and a half years than we have , whether it's rebuilding our military , (applause) , all made in the USA; whether it's the biggest tax cuts in history; whether it's the biggest regulation cuts in history; ANWR in Alaska, the largest field, perhaps, in the world that Ronald Reagan , going back even before Ronald Reagan, no President could get it approved. I got it approved, and now it's potentially one of the greatest sites in the world. Should be the greatest site in the world. So many different things we've done. We've done so much. What we've done for our vets , and you're a big vet state. Ohio loves its vets and what we've done for our vets , (applause) , Choice and Accountability. We got two things. They've been trying for almost 50 years , Choice. Veterans Choice. How about that? We got that for you. So if you have to wait on line for two days or two weeks or two months , and they had to wait two months sometimes. If they had to wait on line, they don't anymore. They go outside, they get a private doctor, we approve it, we pay the bill. And we take care of our vets like they're supposed to be taken care of. Just got a 91 percent approval rating. (Applause.) The VA just got a 91 percent approval rating , highest ever. The highest it's ever had. And Accountability , we have people that are so , were so scornful, they had hatred for our vets. They were treating our vets badly. Our vets have to be treated great. But you couldn't fire them. They could be sadistic, they could be thieves, they could be , you couldn't fire them because of civil service unions, et cetera. You know. Couldn't fire them. And I got the Accountability , VA Accountability. Now you look at them, they don't do a good job for our vets, you say, 'Jim, you're fired.' Boom. 'Get out.' That's the story. (Applause.) We actually terminated over 8,000 people that were not treating our vets well, and they were there for a long time. And it sounds a little bit cold, but the truth is they got to treat our vets well, right? So they have to do it. But we got Accountability and we got VA Choice. But to achieve the vision that we've been talking about for so long, we must finish the job and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And we're doing it. (Applause.) For years, left-wing politicians smiled and looked at American workers right in the eye and took advantage of them and lied to them. They took your endorsements, they took your money, and they took your votes, and they did nothing. Then they turned around and inflicted one corrupt betrayal of the American middle class after another, whether it was NAFTA, TPP, the horrible Korea deal, the ridiculous Paris Climate Accord , how's it working out for Paris? Not so good. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization, which is probably the worst of all the deals, if you want to know the truth. That was where China signed that and they went up like a rocket ship. And they violated the rules like nobody has ever violated them before. In fact, they're considered a developing nation. And because they're a developing nation, they have advantages. Well, we didn't accept that. But for years, they accepted that. And, by the way, Joe Biden supported every single one of those horrible, disastrous sellouts. Under this administration, those days have been over, and we're not going back. We're respected again as a country. You know, we're respected again. You may not feel it, although I think you do. You may not see it. You don't read about it from the fake news, but this country is respected again. We don't let people take advantage of us, including our allies, who took tremendous advantage of us. Tremendous. (Applause.) Our allies took tremendous advantage of us both militarily, where they don't pay their bills. We protect them, they don't pay , like Germany, we're reducing the force. They don't pay. They're delinquent. I say it all the time. They're delinquent. They got to pay. You know, we protect Germany from Russia, and yet, Germany is paying billions of dollars a year , billions and billions to Russia for energy. So I say, 'What's that all about?' So we protect, and they pay money, and we protect. So we don't stand for things like that, but we have many other things. I could stand up here all day long and tell you things that you wouldn't even believe. To fully restore American prosperity, we must stop the radical left-wing movement that would destroy our country. They want to impose $3 trillion of new taxes on American families. They want to ban fracking, which will demolish your state. It will demolish Ohio oil and gas jobs. They want to rejoin the disastrous Paris Climate Accord, where you'll pay billions and billions of dollars for the privilege of getting ripped off by other countries; and inflict a socialist takeover of the U.S. economy, known as the horrendous Green New Deal. It was conceived by a young woman, AOC , AOC plus three, I say. AOC , that's a real beauty isn't it? She knows as much about the environment , do we have any young children here? , as that young child over there. I think he knows more. (Laughter.) And she certainly knows nothing about the economy. And if they ever had their chance, you would find that out, and it wouldn't take very long. You know, Venezuela was a very wealthy country 20 years ago , one of the wealthiest , per capita, one of the wealthiest. Tremendous oil reserves, everything. Now they don't have food. They don't have water. They don't have medicine, they don't have anything. Same thing could happen, same or similar ideology. They also want to throw open American borders, give free taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens, defund police, abolish ICE, abolish borders , no more borders , and abolish basically the American Dream. This is Joe Biden. And does anybody really think he's strong enough to stand up to these ruthless, vicious people? You look at , you look at Portland, you look at what's going on in Seattle, these are the people that you're dealing with. If I didn't send in the troops, if I didn't send in the great people from Homeland Security, you'd have courthouses and post offices and everything else burned down, blown up. And we may send in something else because you know what? They've been riding now for 70 days and the mayor thinks it's just wonderful, and the governor has no idea what she's doing. I've never seen people like this. Remember, in Seattle, where they took over a big chunk of the city? Seattle. And the mayor said, 'It's going to be a Summer of Love.' And I said, 'She's just kidding, right? Isn't she?' She wasn't kidding. But we were all set to send in the troops, send in the people that we were going to send in. And what happened is amazing. We told them, and all of a sudden, the police went out and they cleaned it up. But that place would still be occupied if we didn't get involved. Same thing with Minneapolis. Minneapolis was a disaster. After five or six days, they were going to lose that whole city. We sent in the National Guard. They took care of things in about one hour. Remember the scene of them walking down the street, firing the tear gas? Now you're not even allowed , if you're looking at the other side, you're not allowed to use tear gas or pepper spray. You can't use any of that stuff. They can use Molotov cocktails and horrible things on you, but you're not allowed to do anything. So the police didn't want to have anything to do with the convention in a great state, Wisconsin , Milwaukee , for the Democrats. You couldn't use tear gas. You couldn't use pepper spray. You couldn't use anything. Think of how ridiculous this is. And you won't be able to use your guns because they're going to end your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. But the proud people of Ohio will not let that happen. Together, we will preserve, protect, and defend our American way of life. As long as I am President , (applause) , thank you. Thank you. As long as I am President of the United States, I will fight for you with every ounce of energy and strength that I have. I will be your voice. I will defend your jobs. I will stand up to the foreign trade cheaters and violators that hate our country. I will never let you down. I will have your back, 100 percent. For more than a century, the workers of this company have continued the proud tradition of American greatness embodied by your legendary founder, Lou Upton. It's a heritage grounded in the values of hard work and determination, innovation and excellence, faith and family, loyalty and patriotism passed down from one generation to the next. You have an incredible heritage. These are the values that have defined this company and defined our country from the very beginning, and they are the values that will define our future, that will ensure our success, and that will allow America to thrive and win for many generations to come. There is nobody that can defeat us. Nobody. Now I'd like to take just a moment to introduce a few of the Whirlpool men and women whose jobs I had the honor of taking decisive action to protect and to save. Keri Wallace is an operations analyst whose family has 100 years of history at this very plant. Keri, please come forward and say a few words. Please. (Applause.) Thank you, Keri. Thank you. Thank you, Keri. Wow. Great job. Marco Ontiveros is a first-generation American who started at this plant to support his family 17 years ago. Marco rose through leadership to become a production lead. Marco, please come up and say a few words, please. (Applause.) Well, thank you both. And, you know, Marco had a beautiful speech written, and he never looked down. You never even looked down at that speech. (Laughter.) I'm , I'm impressed. With both of you, I'm impressed. To every worker here at Whirlpool, thank you once again for welcoming us. It's an honor to be here. And thank you for your commitment to American manufacturing. You're a great company with great, great people. Together, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our factories, and we will bring back our American Dream. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)"}

We have a lot of wonderful things happening for the country. I'll probably be talking to you a little bit later about the coronavirus. We're going to try and keep that at about the same time. We have a lot of good information, some new information. Vaccines are doing very, very well. We had some good talks this morning on vaccines and on therapeutics. A lot of good things are happening. Go ahead. Q You said that , you said that a vaccine can be ready around November 3rd. Are you optimistic that that will happen? And will that give you a boost in the election? THE PRESIDENT: On the vaccine? Q Yes. THE PRESIDENT: I am. I'm optimist that it'll be probably around that date. I believe we'll have the vaccine before the end of the year certainly, but around that date, yes. I think so. Q Mr. President, will that give you a boost in the election? Will that help you in the election? THE PRESIDENT: It wouldn't hurt. It wouldn't hurt. But I'm not doing the , I'm doing it, not for the election. I want it fast because I want to save a lot of lives. Q Mr. President, in an interview this week, you were talking about people dying of coronavirus. You said, \"That's true and it is what it is.\" You used the words, \"It is what it is.\" Is that the message you , THE PRESIDENT: No, you look at the statement I made right after that, because if you look at it , Q \"It is what it is, but that doesn't mean we aren't doing everything we can.\" But you said, \"It is what it is.\" THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, and I said something after that too. Q What message does that, though, send to families? THE PRESIDENT: So , so the message that I have is very simple: Nobody can do what I've done in terms of all of the things that we're doing to combat this horrible disease that never should have been sent to us, that was sent , it came from China; should never have been allowed to leave China. They could have easily done something. They stopped it from coming into China, but they didn't stop it from coming into the U.S. and Europe and the rest of the world. And China should have done something about it. And, frankly, it's a disgrace that they didn't. Q Mr. President, are you going to be talking to Governor Cuomo when you're in New York? THE PRESIDENT: We'll be talking to Governor Cuomo. They're looking to do a project , the Second Avenue subway, as you know. And we're talking about that. We're also talking about the tram from the airport to a certain location. So we'll be talking to him. Yes. Q But this weekend, are you going to meet with him? Or , THE PRESIDENT: I think they have something scheduled, maybe in Bedminster. Yeah. Q What evidence have you seen about children being immune from this virus? THE PRESIDENT: All you have to do is read the newspapers or read the , read the medical reports. Q Well, the CDC , the CDC, Mr. President, says there's a , Q What price did China pay for what they've done to the entire world? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we're going to see. What China did is a terrible thing. Whether it was incompetence or on purpose, it was a terrible thing that they did to the world , not only to the United States, but to the world. A terrible thing. Q Do you have any comment on the New York State Attorney General moving to dissolve the NRA? THE PRESIDENT: I just heard about that. That's a very terrible thing that just happened. I think the NRA should move to Texas and lead a very good and beautiful life, and I've told them that for a long time. I think they should move to Texas , Texas would be a great place , or to another state of their choosing. But I would say that Texas would be a great place and an appropriate place for the NRA. This has been going on for a long time. They've been absolutely decimated by the cost of that lawsuit, and it's very sad. But I would suggest that that's what they should be doing. Thank you.

{"SpeechID":"VSDT982020422","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-08-09","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump Before Air Force One Departure","Type":"speech","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. We had a very important call this morning at eight o'clock with Lebanon and with many leaders from different countries. And I think it was , first of all, it's one of the most horrific things I've ever seen. But it was a very important call. It was a , really led with France and President Macron, who is very close, as you know, to Lebanon. And we had it , a lot of things were worked out. We're going to do a lot of help. We've got to help them. A lot of countries are going to be helping; I think 150. But it's probably , the number of lost could be astronomical. They say at least 5,000 were injured, and that means many hundreds of people were killed. That is a horrible situation. So, the United States is working very diligently. We have three planes going over, loaded up with medical supplies, food, and water. We'll be sending additional planes. That took place this morning. It was a teleconference call with various leaders from , and (inaudible). Please. Q Mr. President, on that issue, how much aid is the U.S. pledging, in terms of financial assistance? And will there be conditions attached to it? THE PRESIDENT: I haven't given a number, but it'll be substantial. On a humanitarian basis, we have to do it. We have to do it. It's , you'd almost say, \"How does a country survive such a tragedy?\" It was at a level , I have people over there; they said this is at a level that we've never seen before , the blast. They've never seen anything like it. So, we'll be helping them and substantially. We've had three major planes already over with a lot of medical , mostly medical equipment. It's , various things to help. We have some excellent military that do this, and they reported back that they've never seen anything like this before. So, it's a horrific situation, but we'll help. Q Mr. President, there is a lot of criticism today from Democrats about your executive orders. How do you see talks going forward? Do you think talks will start again? THE PRESIDENT: So, the Democrats were just unwilling to do anything, and all they wanted to think about was how to steal an election. We discussed it yesterday, Jeff, where they wanted all sorts of things having to do with mail-in voting. They wanted no signature verification. They were asking for things that just had nothing to do with what we're talking about. And we've been going through this routine for a long time , a number of weeks , and it was time to act. And actually, we've been largely praised. We have to get money out to the people. It was China's fault. They did this horrific thing. It was China's fault. We have to get money out to the people. So, I would say , I mean, you may say that, you know, you've heard some negatives, but I've heard mostly positives. Mostly positives, even from people that you would least think would be very positive. Q Do you want the talks to start again? THE PRESIDENT: I hear that's what the Democrats want to do now. They want , look, they were not interested in doing what they had to do. Their big point of discussion was bailouts. They wanted to bail out poorly run, Democrat states, like , you know, I could name them. I could give them to you right now. But why do it? Because you know the same states as I do , and cities. And we don't , we're not going to do that. We'll help, but we're not going to do numbers. They talked about a number of a trillion dollars. We can't do that. Jonathan. Q On the issue of the unemployment insurance , the $400: There was some criticism from Democrats saying that a lot of states can't afford to do their part, to do the $100. Would the federal government up , would you up what you're willing to give? THE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) We have a system where we can do 100 percent or we can do 75 percent. They'd pay 25. And it'll depend on the state. And they'll make an application, we'll look at it, and we'll make a decision. So it may be they'll pay nothing in some instances. It may be they'll , a little bit like the National Guard. You know, the National Guard, as you know, sometimes will pay all of it depending on the tragedy or whatever it may be , the disaster , and sometimes the state will pay 40 percent, 25 percent, 10 percent, or nothing, depending on how it's worked out. So this , Q What about the states that can't afford to chip in? THE PRESIDENT: We can make a decision on that on individual states with an application. Okay. Q Mr. President, is it time for you to personally step in on the talks and maybe give Speaker Pelosi a call, invite her to the Oval Office? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I've been involved personally, and , you know, through my representatives, who are wonderful. And we have additional people, too. But I'm involved very , you know, look, I've been on the phone a lot over the last three or four days. And I think it actually works better if we do it the way we're doing it. We've gotten much of what we wanted without having to give up anything, and that's very good. You can't beat that. You can't beat the deal we've made. We've gotten much of what we wanted, and they didn't get what they wanted. And they would have , and I guess they still could, in all fairness. I mean, I hear that Nancy Pelosi wants to call and she wants to see if she can do something. But they're much more inclined to make a deal now than they would've been two days ago. Q If she calls, would you speak to her? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I'd talk to her. Q Mr. President, you mentioned the Postal Service. We've seen some cutbacks. Is now the right time to be doing that? And is it going to be prepared for November? Would you think about doing any sort of actions on your own? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I didn't speak to the Postmaster General in the Post Office. I know this: He's a very good businessman. He's very successful. And I know he wants to make the Post Office at least somewhat lose a lot less money than , they've lost so much money over the decade. Nobody has ever , nothing loses money like the Post Office. And he wants to make it successful. He wants to make it so it can operate, so that you don't have to give it $25 billion a year to sustain itself. So, you'd really have to ask him those questions, but he wants to make it self-sustaining and successful. He's a very, very smart guy. He's a great businessman. So let's see what he can do. Q Do you have confidence in the Postal Service for November? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I have confidence that they're going to make it into something. But, as you know, it's been losing massive amounts of money over the last number of decades. Massive amounts of money. This is not something new. This is something that's been taking place for a long time. It loses a tremendous amount of money. Q But do you , there is some criticism that the Postmaster's policies is what's causing the mail delays. Do you think now is the time to be delaying the mail? And should there be some infusion of money for the election? THE PRESIDENT: Well, in light of the stories that are coming out about all of the problems with mail-in voting, whether it's the congressional race , Carolyn Maloney, in New York, where they called it and they don't even have the ballots. The whole thing is crazy. There's one that just came across my desk, and I'm going to look into it, but I hear it's a catastrophe , on mail-in voting. We just can't have that. It's a , you got to have an honest election. And if it's not going to be an honest election, you have to call them out. Q Mr. President, you were at the home of your friend, Stanley Chera, for the fundraiser. THE PRESIDENT: Who passed away due to COVID. Q Right. THE PRESIDENT: And he's a great man. He was a great person. He was a very early supporter. He just thought , he was a very successful real estate man. I knew him in New York. One of the most successful. And he was really one of my early supporters. He said, \"Trump is going to win.\" He was so , he said, \"You don't understand \" Right from the day I came down the escalator with our First Lady , our future First Lady , he said, \"You don't understand: Trump is going to win.\" And he said that to the smartest people in New York, and he said it to richest people, and he said it the poorest people. He said, \"You don't understand Trump. He's going to win.\" And he was right. And he was very much involved. But he was diagnosed, you know, a number of weeks ago. He went to the hospital. And unfortunately, he didn't make it. And he was just a fantastic person. One of the most charitable people you'll ever meet. He helped a lot of people. Okay? Q Mr. President, did you say that you want to permanently cut the payroll tax? Or is it just a temporary cut? THE PRESIDENT: It may be permanent. We're looking into it. Right now, we have it cut. It's going to a certain time, as you know. And we'll take it out until the end of the year, and then I'm going to make a decision as to, number one, an extension; and, number two, making it permanent and no reimbursement. Q What about Social Security? That funds the Social Security trust fund. THE PRESIDENT: Well, what we're doing is we reimburse through the general fund, not through Social Security. This will have no impact on Social Security. We're going to impact , we're going to, through the general funds, reimburse. This will have zero impact on Social Security. Q Mr. President , THE PRESIDENT: And I've been (inaudible) at Social Sec- , we protect Social Security. Q (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT: Because, you know, it's a beautiful thing what's happening. You look at our markets, how well they're doing that, in a pandemic, we're going to hit , we're very close to hitting new stock market highs. And, in some instances , as an example, NASDAQ , we've hit the highest it's ever been. I think 14 or 15 days have set records. So, that's a great achievement. We're going to have tremendous growth, and a lot of good things are happening. But that's going to come out of the general fund, not out of Social Security. Please. Q Mr. President, how long do you think you can pay uninsurance? It looks like only four or five weeks. THE PRESIDENT: We'll be able to do it as long as we deem it necessary. And I will say this: The Democrats have called. They'd like to get together. And we say: If it's not a waste of time, we'll do it. But if it is a waste of time, it doesn't make sense. Thank you all very much. Have a good flight. Thank you.

We call it a \"super V.\" It's no longer a \"V\"; it's a \"super V.\" And they didn't think that could happen, and they're probably not happy about it. They want to punish American citizens instead of holding them high. Where Joe Biden sees American darkness, I see American greatness. We've seen heroic doctors and nurses racing into action to save lives. We've seen first responders helping strangers in need. We've seen the passage of historic legislation to save 50 million American jobs. We've mobilized American industry like never before. We've built military hospitals from scratch, produced lifesaving therapies, and we're on track to develop the most incredible, from a standpoint of time , record time , vaccines. We have vaccines. You'll be reading about them very soon. Way, way ahead of schedule. Years ahead of schedule. This would have been, where we are now, phase three trials, clinical trials. You wouldn't have been there in two or three years, if you went back to another administration. It's time to reject the anger and the hate of the Democrat Party. We have the biggest election coming up, of our lifetime. (Applause.) No party can lead America that spends so much time tearing down America. But the biggest part of last night's speech was what Joe Biden didn't talk about. He didn't talk about law enforcement. He didn't talk about bringing safety to Democrat-run cities that are totally out of control and they have no clue. China was never mentioned in any way, shape, or form. China will own our country, if he gets elected. They will own our country. And we're not going to let that happen. (Applause.) And you've seen the intelligence reports: China very much wants Joe Biden to win. That would be very insulting if they wanted me to win. I don't think so. (Laughter.) I don't think so. We've taken in billions and billions of dollars from China. We've given it to our farmers. We've given it to a lot. They had the worst year they've had in 67 years; we had the best year we ever had. We've demonstrated over the last four years the extraordinary gains that are possible while we stand strong for our beliefs, when we trust the wisdom of our Founders, and when we embrace America's destiny. It's a great destiny. With your help, we carried out the largest tax and regulation cuts, by far, in American history. And , (applause) , and they now want to quadruple tax us, and they want to quadruple, and beyond, the regulation cuts. And when we say \"tax\" and we say \"regulation\" and you say, \"Oh, tax cuts. That's so wonderful,\" , but the people in this room that are the heads of industry , you have some very powerful people in this room , they know that the regulation cuts may have been even more important than the biggest tax cuts we've ever had. (Applause.) To build a highway in this country, it could take, in certain places, 18, 19, 20, even 21 years to get approved. This is not even thinkable. And we've got it now down to two, and we'll have it down to probably one. And it may get rejected for safety reasons or for environmental reasons. That's okay; it may happen. But we have it down , we will soon have it down to one year from as much as 21 years. We have cases that have just been disastrous. So I just wanted you to know some of the little details. But that's what we're working on. We'll have it down to one year to build a highway. You can do it all in one year. It doesn't have to take 21 years and cost 100 times more. Literally, I've seen 100 times more. We eliminated Obamacare's unfair individual mandate penalty, which is really the elimination of Obamacare. (Applause.) And to give to critically ill patients access to life-saving drugs, we passed a thing called , and hopefully nobody in this room will need it, but if you do, it's Right to Try. We have the greatest medicines, the greatest doctors and labs in the world. And we have things that won't be approved by the FDA for a little while, although I've cut that time now down in half. It used to be 12 years. Now we've cut it down in more than half. And you see that with the vaccines. You see it with the therapeutics. But Right to Try, where we have the right to now go in and use some of these very promising drugs. And the response has been unbelievable. What's happened and the lives saved have been really incredible. People used to leave for Asia. They used to leave for Europe. They used to leave for other places all over the world or they'd go home and die. They'd go home and die. If they had no money, they'd go home and die, which is most people. Now they sign a very short, simple document, and they have the right to try, and it's given them hope, and in many cases, it's given their life back. So it's been a great thing. These are things that nobody talks about but it's , (applause) , they've been trying to get that approved, by the way. Not as easy as it sounds. It's complicated because you have the insurance companies and the doctors and the hospitals, and the country itself doesn't want to get sued. And so not , not very easy. But they've been trying to get it approved by , for 41 years, they've been trying to get that. That's just one of many, many things that we've done. For 41 years. To provide our amazing veterans the care they deserve, we passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. Many, many decades, they've been trying to get that. (Applause.) Choice, meaning you wait on line and you can't see a doctor, and they would wait in line for a week or two weeks or five weeks. Sometimes they'd be ill, and they'd end up being terminally ill by the time they saw the doctor. And we're letting them go out, get a private doctor immediately, and we pay the bill. And we just got a 91 percent approval rating in the VA , the highest we've ever had by many points. Ninety-one percent. (Applause.) And VA Accountability sounds simple, but it's not. You couldn't let anybody go, no matter how they disrespected our great vets, no matter what they said to them, no matter how badly they treated them. I mean, we had sadists and we had thieves; we had a lot of bad people. You couldn't fire them under any circumstances. Under any circumstance, you couldn't fire them. And now we say, \"You: You're fired.\" (Laughter and applause.) Both VA Accountability. And they've wanted to have that , they've wanted to have that , actually, they've let go of 9,000 people; replaced them with people that love our vets, want to take care of our vets. And great people. And we had a terrible thing going. You couldn't get them fired because, you know, civil service and unions and different things, you couldn't fire them. Now you can fire them, and you can fire them quickly if they're not doing the job. It's a big deal. And we don't talk about it a lot, nobody talks about it, but they've been trying to get those two things approved for more than four decades. And now they're done and they're approved. We ended the Obama-Biden administration's war on American energy. And the United States is now the leading producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. It's a big thing. (Applause.) And remember this: If you look at what they're doing , Biden , he wants to end fracking, end petroleum products , end petroleum. No natural gas, no nothing. End everything. And that's it. How does that work in Texas? How does that work in Pennsylvania? I was in Pennsylvania yesterday, a place that he said he was born in, which is true, but he left when he was like nine years old. (Laughter.) So he left a long time ago. Left , he left seven decades ago. (Laughter.) And he still calls it his home. And his real home is a place he never leaves anymore. (Laughter and applause.) He just never leaves. He never leaves the outskirts of that state. You'd think you'd go a little bit, you know. It's not that far. Never leaves. We'll figure it out pretty soon. But they want to end fracking. They want to end drilling. They want to end everything. They want to end all of that. So I said , think of it: They want to end oil. They want to end , and this is the way it is , guns. They want to take away Second Amendment, right? How about that? AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: That alone should win you the election. Right? That alone. (Applause.) And , AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: And I protected your Second Amendment. Did you think that was easy for the last four years? (Laughter.) Everyone is, \"Oh, look, he's wilting. He's wilting.\" And , no, we're not wilting. And we've had people that were in tragedies, and they lost a son in a school and they lost a daughter, beautiful Meadow. And that gentleman has been a friend of mine , he knows exactly who I'm talking about. Beautiful Meadow. They're totally in favor. They've actually gotten hardline on Second Amendment. It's not one way. It's an incredible thing to see, actually. But we held totally strong, and it's always going to be with us. But if they get in, they will absolutely , either obliterate it to a point of no return or actually terminate it. And I have no doubt about it. I have absolutely no doubt about it. It's something we can't let happen , such a big part of our security and our safety , and your entertainment and all, but I say security and safety probably first, right? And God , it's an attack on God. It's an attack on religion. Did you see the man that got up and sang a very, very special phrase from a very, very special thing? And he left the word \"God\" out and I was watching, and I said, \"Oh, he must have made a mistake.\" I didn't think that he left it out. I thought maybe he , you know, that can happen. Maybe he made a mistake. He didn't make a mistake. That's where they're coming from. He left the word \"God\" out. And that's where they're coming from. I withdrew from the one-sided Pari- , if you , if you see it, the Paris Climate , I call it the Paris Climate disaster. This was a way of , (applause) , this was a way of taking advantage of the United States. We wouldn't be able to drill; we wouldn't be able to frack; we wouldn't have energy. Russia went way back into the dirtiest years. China didn't even come into it until 2030 or 2035, and when they did, they came in very lightly. We came in immediately, and we would have had to close down many, many businesses in order to achieve the goals that they set, which are totally unrealistic. We would have , it was a disaster. And, you know, it's an amazing thing: When I did that and when I did a couple of others , the environmental bills, the Clean Waters Act. How about that? It sounds so beautiful. The theme is so beautiful. In fact, when I did it, I said I'm going to be killed on this one, and I did it. And I was surrounded by farmers and developers, builders that build houses, and others. And they never cried; they're very strong people. They never cried a day in their life. They were almost all crying. I said, \"What was \" , it was a big, strong guy , \" when was the last time you cried?\" \"I can't remember, sir.\" I gave them back their life. You know, that took away , (applause) , right? , that took away , that took away their life. And what we did in Minnesota with the iron ore: People came up to me and they said, \"You gave us back our life. Obama wrote it out.\" Iron ore , the best in the world , he wrote it out. We gave it back to them. We went up to Maine; we gave them back their lobsters. We gave them back their fishing. (Applause.) Five thousand square miles. Think of what that is. Take one mile, mile by mile, and now you add five thou- , as big as the ocean is, that was a big chunk, right off the coast of Maine. Their whole thing is like lobsters and fishing, and nobody does it better. And they were not allowed. It was a monument; called a \"monument.\" I said, \"A monument to what?\" I said to the , when I was up in Maine two weeks ago, I said , (laughter) , I said to people that their whole life was lobster fishing , you know, the different things , and they're the best. I said, \"What happened?\" They said, \"He took away our , took away our everything.\" I said, \"How does this area compare to other areas?\" He said, \"First of all, it takes a long time to get to the other areas, this is so big. But second of all, this is the best there is in the world, and he doesn't let us use it.\" And I said, \"And yet, you vote Democrat.\" And so I , (laughter) , (inaudible). It's like Israel. Look what I did for Israel. (Applause.) Thank you. But it's amazing to me because nobody has been worse to Israel than President Obama and Biden. Nobody. Nobody has been worse. Look at the Iran deal. It's the worst thing that ever happened to Israel. And they never moved the embassy to Jerusalem, thereby making Jerusalem the capital of Israel, which I did, and neither did any other president, and I understand why. They campaign on it, campaign. Every President said they were going to do; no President did it until I came along. (Applause.) And the pressure , and I will tell you, the pressure from other parts of the world was enormous. And I've told the story a few times where I just turned off my phone, and when the king calls and this one calls and that one calls , \"We're calling about Israel\" , I say, \"Tell them I'll get back in a couple of days.\" (Laughter.) \"I'll get back in a couple of days. I'll be in next week.\" (Laughter.) Kings and queens and prime ministers and presidents and dictators , everybody was calling: \"Don't do it. Don't do it. It'll be bloodshed all over the Middle East.\" Look what we just did , right? , with the United Arab Emirates and Israel. (Applause.) And now others will follow. And we couldn't have done that if we had the deal with Iran, but they said, \"Don't do it. Don't do it with Israel. Don't do it.\" And I didn't take their call, and I did it. Had a ceremony. It was fine. Nothing happened. Remember? The world was going to blow up. \"This will be the end of the world.\" So I held my breath, and I did it. And you know what happened? Nothing. Except we did something that should have been done many, many decades ago. And every President violated their promise, their campaign promise, except me. And I did it. By the way, I ended in Golan Heights; that was a big one too, by itself. (Applause.) And I did it, and, you know, it's incredible. I then call up these heads of state, many of whom are friends of mine. I get along , actually, you don't hear this from the fake news back there. A lot of , oh, there's a lot of a lot of press. A lot of press. But, you know, you don't hear this from the people back there, but I actually have very good relationships with leaders, with many of them. And some of them just take too much advantage of our country, including some of our so-called allies. You know, some of them are the worst for taking advantage of us. But you don't hear that. Then , so what I did is I called some of the leaders the following week. \"Hi. How you doing? What's up.\" \"Oh, we wanted to talk to you about Israel, but you already did it.\" I said, \"Oh, I wish I got to you a little bit sooner.\" (Laughter.) But that's easier , that's easier than having somebody asking you over and over, \"Please don't do it.\" But I could see there was a lot of pressure. I'd never understood why it wasn't done. It wasn't done because there's tremendous pressure put on the President of the United States by many other countries, much more than you would think and different countries than you would even think. Countries that you wouldn't think even cared about it were calling, asking not to do it. So we did it, and it's been really quite historic, I guess. And I could run in Israel, and I think they set up probably a 98 percent approval rating in Israel. (Laughter and applause.) So it's been , it's been good. And you know who appreciates it the most are the evangelical Christians. They appreciate it the most. (Applause.) So it's been , it's been quite a interest- , that was , that has been, just by itself , that's one thing out of many, many things, but that's been quite an interesting journey. But we also took historic action to stand up to China's trade cheating and plundering. You know that. We had the best year we ever had, and they've had the worst year they've had in 67 years. I wonder why. And I don't want them to have bad years, but there has been nobody that has ripped off the United States like China for so many years. How Presidents before me allow that to happen, and especially the one just before me. And Joe Biden, with his son walking out with $1.5 billion to manage , meaning, many millions of dollars a year in fees , is a disgrace, okay? He's a disgrace. (Applause.) And then the vast sums of money he was paid by Ukrainian , a Ukrainian company that didn't have the highest standing, to put it mildly, but the vast sums of money , if that ever happened to a Republican, they would have been in jail a long time ago. It's such a double standard , I can't tell you. This whole thing with all of the things that happened. The deep state , you can believe it; you don't have to believe it , but it's very unfair. And I will say that if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, with calling off the prosecutors or you're not going to get a billion dollars. And he's on tape; it's not like, \"Oh, gee.\" I mean, he's on tape. We wouldn't have had a chance. It's a disgrace. The double standard is a disgrace. And hopefully it'll be brought back to fairness. And remember this: They spied on my campaign and they got caught. They can say what they want. This FBI agent has just now , first one , admitted. That's the beginning, hopefully, of the falling castle. But he's admitted that he forged documents. He changed documents, reversing them. And he admitted it. So let's see what's going to happen over the next, hopefully, short period of time, because it's been unfair that we've had to wait so long; that was so obvious for a long time. And it should never be allowed to happen to another President again , that, I can tell you. And that's for the good of the country, not for me. For the good of the country. (Applause.) Within three years, we replaced NAFTA , which everybody said was impossible to do , with the brand-new and really pro-America USMCA. It's a whole different ballgame, and we don't want to lose our companies to Mexico and Canada. And this puts a tremendous price tag on doing that if they want to do that. They won't be doing that. In everything we do, my administration is fighting for the American people and delivering one victory after another. We have appointed more than 230 federal judges. We expect to be perhaps over 300 federal judges by the end of the year. (Applause.) And there's , I can tell you, it's driving them crazy. (Laughter.) Don't forget, President Obama , they say he was a great President. Well, you can't be a great President when much of what he's done we've undone. And you can't be a great President when you leave 142 empty judgeships. You know, I don't think any President has left any. You don't leave , these are very, very important things for a party. Different policies, different everything. You understand it better than anybody, the people in this room. Left us 142. First day in office, I said, \"How many judges do I have to appoint?\" \"Sir, you have 142.\" I said, \"You have to be kidding.\" (Laughter.) One hundred and forty , so I had a big head start. But we have 142, but now we will have, I think, in excess , by the time we finish , in excess of 300, including Court of Appeals. And, of course, two very exceptional Supreme Court justices. So it's really great. (Applause.) And remember this, in terms of, \"Get Out the Vote\" , the next President, I think, could have anywhere from two to four, to maybe even five , just based on statistics; statistically , Supreme Court justices to pick. Think of that: I've had two. Some , some Presidents have had none because you, generally, pick them young, and they last a long time, right? They can last a long time. But , but we could have two to three to four, maybe even to five. It's probably a stretch, but four isn't a stretch at all. That would mean that the entire balance of the court doesn't just shift: It becomes dominant. So, if we , if we don't win, which we don't want to think about , we have to think positively. And the polls today, Rasmussen: 51 percent. And they were the ones that got it right last time. Them, and a few others. (Applause.) Fifty-one percent. They don't want to show those polls. They only want to show those polls , not \"likely\" voters , \"registered voters.\" What does that mean? Many are dead? (Laughter.) Many have switched their party affiliations. You know, \"registered.\" They don't show \"likely.\" But you see some of these polls where they interview many more Democrats than Republicans, and they have to, I guess, by law, put it in , you know, they interviewed , but many more. And they don't go \"likely.\" Why don't they do \"likely\" voters? Because I think they'd be very upset. I think they know they'd be very upset. Bottom line: We're doing very well. We have the biggest crowds. I think there's more enthusiasm now, for this election, than there was even , it's record enthusiasm, by the way. Record-setting enthusiasm, right now. It's more now than we had even four years ago. Does that make sense? (Applause.) And we had the same , we had the same thing, four years ago, where they'd say , but now we've done so much. You know, this is easier, in many ways. We were sailing , by the way, without the plague from China, this thing was over. This was over. We were sailing. But that came in, and then you have to prove yourself again. So now I have to prove myself again. But we're doing that. We're building up the economy. And we're way ahead, by every poll , even the fake polls , we're way ahead on the economy, which is very important. (Laughter.) But we are. I mean, think of it: You prove yourself. You're in this, and now you have to do it again. But that's what we're doing. We have the \"V.\" We have the super \"V\" we can talk about. But with the help of countless faith leaders , many of you are in the room; we appreciate it , we passed historic criminal justice reform. (Applause.) And nobody has done more for the black community or the Hispanic community than we have. Nobody. Nobody. (Applause.) I guess, maybe Lincoln. Questionable. Abraham Lincoln. But nobody has , I don't think anybody, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. But nobody has done more. If you look at Opportunity Zones, you look at all of the things we've done , nobody has done more. After years of neglect by both parties, my administration understands that a strong nation must have strong borders. (Applause.) By next week, we will have gone up to over, as I say, 300 miles. That's hard to believe. And that was tough. They didn't want it. Do you notice now that we're building it, you don't hear about it anymore? It's , (laughter). They don't want to talk about it anymore, and it's a bad issue for the Democrats because everyone knows walls work. You know, it's interesting: No matter , with all the technology and all the changes you see, you don't recognize a computer from five years ago. It's not even recognizable. Two things don't change, right? Walls and wheels. (Laughter.) And you can come back , you can come back in 2,000 years from now, and two things will still be around: wheels and walls. (Laughter.) Remember when they were saying, \"The wall doesn't do anything.\" They wanted to have a drone flying around. You know, flying around (inaudible), so you could watch everybody pour into our country. (Laughter.) We've ended catch-and-release, one of the great scams of all time. (Applause.) Catch-and-release. We'd catch them and release them. They should say \"catch and release into our country\" because you catch them, and then you release them, and you weren't allowed to bring them. Now we bring them back. We absolutely bring them back. We've dismantled drug smuggling and human trafficking of , these networks are horrible. (Applause.) The human trafficking in women, which has turned out , you think of it as almost an ancient crime, but it's not. It's bigger now, all over the world, than it's ever been because of the computer, because of the Internet. It's bigger now than ever before. It's a horrible thing. Much of it through the southern border. But all over the world, this is taking place, and we've brought it down to levels that nobody thought even possible. But it's a terrible thing. Mostly trafficking in women , children to a lesser extent, but women. We've removed 20,000 gang members, including 4,500 MS-13 members, and we brought them back to their countries. And their countries, under the Obama administration, didn't want to take people. You know that, right? They didn't want to take them. They'd say, \"No, don't bring them back here. We're not taking them.\" Guatemala, El Salvador , right? , Honduras. They wouldn't want to , they wouldn't take people back. Now they take them back. They say, \"Oh, thank you very much.\" (Applause.) The last administration left us with a Middle East in chaos. This was a Middle East in chaos. Iran was empowered and exporting terror. They don't have too much money now. They're not spending billions of dollars, giving it to al Qaeda, Hezbollah, some of these wonderful groups that are totally vicious, crazed lunatics. But Iran is different. It's having a hard time. Its GDP went down at a level that you wouldn't even believe , in the 20s , and they'll make a deal. I say they'll make a deal within a month, but I probably mean a week. But I just want to be right. (Laughter.) Because they'll call me. They'll say, \"It took 10 days. He was wrong.\" (Laughter.) They just want to see , if I win, they'll be in making a deal. And if for some reason I don't, they'll take their time, and they will get one of the great deals, since the last one, where we paid them $150 billion. A billion. Gave them $150 [billion] for nothing. It wasn't even a long-term deal. It was , you know, right now, the time is almost up. This was like a short-term deal. It was like you rent a store in a shopping center. This , these are countries we're dealing with. You need length. But it was a short-term deal. But more importantly, we gave them $1.8 billion in cash. Think of that: Cash. Cash. We flew it in, in Boeing 757s loaded from floor to ceiling with cash. What were these people thinking? And had I kept that deal , we terminated that deal , had I kept that deal, we could never have started this incredible thing that's happening with UAE, Israel. And everybody is saying, \"Why haven't you invited us?\" \"Okay, we're \" , many countries now want to come in. This was an impossible thing to even conceive of. Impossible. (Applause.) Even Tom Friedman at the New York Times gave us an A-plus. Can you believe it? He couldn't even believe it. I wouldn't say he's been a big fan. (Laughter.) But the New York Times gave us the best editorial I've had. I can't even believe it. I'm surprised they did it. I'm sure they've changed it by now, and they , (laughter). Somebody got in and they said, \"Who wrote that editorial?\" They probably lost their job. But Tom Friedman actually wrote the editorial. It was very fair. It's true. He couldn't believe it. It's a , it's gotten great reviews from everybody: Wall Street Journal, Washington Post. Can you believe that one? Everybody gave it. And we couldn't have done that deal had we stayed in this horrible deal done by John Kerry, who just had no clue as to negotiation. He never got up. They would tell him, \"We want this, we want this, we want this \" And he'd sit there, and he'd agree to everything. Sometimes you have to get up and walk. He never got up and walked. Once he rode his bicycle , remember? , and he was in an accident. (Laughter.) I promised: At 73-years old, I said, \"I'll never be riding a bicycle.\" He was , he had the helmet. He had the names, the insignias all over him. He had insignias like, you know, like he was a 20-year-old great cyclist from France. (Laughter.) So that delayed him about two months. They said, \"He just got hurt in a bicycle accident.\" What? It's not a good accident when you're , so I promised I wouldn't do that. I might get hurt, but I'm not getting hurt riding a bicycle. (Laughter.) But if you look at the Obama administration, ISIS was rampaging all over. I've defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. (Applause.) Yesterday, we had the Prime Minister of Iraq in my office, and he made a statement. He said, \"Sir, I want to thank you. You have defeated ISIS.\" I said, \"Wait a minute, when you say that \" Nobody ever says that. Those people back there don't say it. \"What do you mean by that?\" He said, \"You.\" I said, \"Do you mean Obama? Do you mean the United States?\" \"Sir, Obama , it was a disaster. When you took over, ISIS was in 30 percent of our country. You came in, and you defeated.\" I said, \"Would you please go public with that?\" So, he said, \"I would.\" He would. But it's true. I mean, we defeated 100 percent of the caliphate, and we turned it all around. We rebuilt the United States military , $2.5 trillion. We have a brand-new, beautiful military. (Applause.) And as I said, with Israel, you know, we , we got out of the Iran nuclear deal, which was such a horrible thing for Israel. But I asked a friend of mine who's a big fan of Israel , I said, \"So what was the best? Golan Heights, Jerusalem capital? What was , what was more important of the two?\" Golan Heights, which they've been working on for 52 years , recognition of Golan Heights for Israel, right? Fifty-two years. Planes would fly in. They'd have summits every year or two. Planes would fly in. They'd talk. They'd talk. They kept talking. Two days later, the planes would fly out. Then they'd meet two years later. Fifty-two years they went through that. I got it done immediately. And I said, \"Which is more important: Golan Heights or Jerusalem capital?\" And he said, \"Neither.\" I said, \"What you mean \"neither'?\" He said, \"The most important is when you withdrew from that horrible and very dangerous Iran nuclear deal. That was the greatest thing you did for Israel.\" (Applause.) It's very interesting. And I said, \"I agree.\" I actually said , I said, \"I agree.\" We imposed the toughest-ever U.S. sanctions on Iran, and this week we invoked the snapback provisions to restore virtually all of the previously suspended U.N. sanctions. We snapped back , it's a good term. The founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, is dead. (Applause.) We killed him. And the world's top terrorist , probably over 50 years, the top terrorist , Qasem Soleimani , is dead. (Applause.) He's dead. He's gone. But the more success that we've achieved, the more unhinged the radical left has become. Anarchists and violent mobs have rioted in our Democrat-run cities, attacking our police, and tearing down statues. And, as you know, I signed a , a clause. I got an old bill. You know, when they used to do powerful things, when they knew what the hell they were doing. (Laughter.) I took an old bill, and I gave a nice, beautiful, brand-new executive order. It says, very easily , could you imagine getting this today? , you rip down a statue, a federal statue, you go to jail , prison; they use the term \"prison\" , you go to prison for 10 years. (Applause.) And I remember there was a big march on Washington. They were coming in to knock a lot of statues down. And they had a , they even had Thomas Jefferson planned. That was in their planning. No, thanks. George Washington. They were even thinking about Lincoln. You know, Lincoln did sort of a pretty good job, right? (Laughter.) But they were talking about anybody. I don't even know if they knew what they were doing. They were just wild and out of control. But I signed this , 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue. We have people right now in jail that are going to trial, by the way. And that was from previous to signing. (Applause.) But, if you remember, that was a big thing two and a half months ago. You know when I signed it? Two and a half months ago. (Laughter.) Two and a half months ago, I signed it. We haven't had a problem since. They say, \"You know, we want to knock down that statue, but, you know, 10 years , let's see. Ten years. That's a lot of time. That's a lot of time.\" (Applause.) Which tells you that, you know, laws, if properly utilized, can stop all of this madness. And that's why we have to give our great police back their dignity and their power. (Applause.) I've been endorsed by almost every police organization in the country. We just got, the other day , Pat Lynch, the head of New York City Police, endorsed me. First endorsement , he said, to the best of his knowledge, which is a lot of knowledge, the first time they've ever endorsed a candidate for President. That's good. They don't endorse. The first time ever. (Applause.) All the sheriffs in Florida. Dan can tell you: all of the law enforcement in Texas, right? All of the law enforcement in Texas, Dan. So, it's good. And just about everywhere, we have tremendous support. And you're always going to have bad apples, by the way. You've got some bad apples. And you're going to have it , probably, in this room, we might have one or two. But you have bad apples. But these are great people that do a phenomenal job, that actually are appreciated by the public. By the public, they're appreciated, and they're loved and they're respected. And the public doesn't want to happen what's happening to our police. They took away their dignity, they took away their right to do the job that they want to do, and they're doing the job now. And, for me, they do the job. And you look at most cities in our country , you know, crime is actually down. You look at Chicago, and you say, \"How is that possible?\" You look at New York, what's happened just in a short period of time. But we're with them, and they're with us, and they've done a fantastic job. All right? (Applause.) So the future of our country, and indeed our civilization, is at stake on November 3rd. Earlier this summer, murders rose by 29 percent in New York City, 33 percent in Philadelphia, 53 percent in Chicago, 133 percent in Minneapolis. These are all Democrat-run places. These are Democrat-run , I might say \"radical-left Democrat,\" in some cases. But these are people that don't have any clue what they're doing. They have no idea. I don't even think they know that it's bad, what's going on. You know, you'd almost say they're trying to defend it. It's incredible to hear them. But that's why I launched Operation LeGend, which has led to the arrest of 1,500 criminals since July. And the radical left spent four years trying to illegally overturn the last election; they're still trying to overturn. Hillary Clinton , remember the , Hillary Clinton: \"Will you honor the election?\" (Laughter.) Right? The results of the election. That was Hillary Clinton. And she should have asked that question to herself. (Laughter.) She's like a crazed lunatic. She's a lunatic. (Applause.) She is something, I'll tell you. But somebody said, \"What's the difference between Clinton and Biden?\" Should I say? Should I tell you? Well, Clinton is much smarter, but not a likable person. Joe is not nearly as smart, but he's more likable. So, you know, I don't know, maybe I'd rather have the smarter person. (Laughter.) Who cares about personality, right? But that's the difference. Very simple, isn't it? Huh? It's a very simple thing. But that's why we have to win. We have to win. (Applause.) So now the Democrats are planning to permanently alter our political system so their control is never threatened again. They want to pack the court with radical-left justices; abolish the filibuster, which, frankly, I wish we did it because I said, \"They're going to do it, so we might as well get there first.\" But I couldn't get a couple of people to go along with me. But, you know, my attitude was, \"Schumer is going to do it.\" And they all said, \"No, he'll never do that. He'll never do that.\" Guess what? They're doing it. They're doing it. And as much as we've done , we've done more than anybody has ever done in three and a half years. But you know what? As much as we've done , we would have done more had we done that, because getting those extra 10 votes was almost impossible with these people. Almost impossible. So I wish we had done it. I wanted to do it, but we had some obstacle and obstacles. Will grant , they want to grant mass amnesty for millions of people. And citizenship, they want to give too many million illegal aliens , probably about 11 million, at least , and abolish , they want to abolish voter ID. They want to abolish voter ID. To get into the DNC convention last night, you needed an ID with your picture on it. Now, what does that tell you about , (laughter) , no, to get in last night, a friend of mine was saying , a friend of mine who happened to be there. I said, \"Why were you there?\" (Laughter.) And , no, a very political person. But he shows me , he said, \"Here's the ID. It's got my picture. It's like the most incredible \" It's a disgrace. There's only one reason they don't want voter ID, and that's because they want to cheat. That's all. It cannot be anything else. (Applause.) I mean, you have it on everything. You have it on driver's licenses. You have it on everything, just about. And the only thing , the only one they don't want it on is a vote, which is your most important , the most important thing you have is your vote. And they don't want it. We have it in some states , Indiana. You know, we have some great, really, voter ID. They want to abolish it where it is and never allow it to happen again. And that's only a bad , that's only a bad thing. That's only a bad thing. To everyone in this room, your organization was formed at a time when conservatives led the fight to turn back the tide of communism abroad, communism here. It's a very important organization. Now Americans must rally to turn back the radical-left socialists and Marxists right here at home. And you see that when you see these people rioting in Portland, where you see the anger, the craziness. These people are crazy. They're crazy. And we won't let it go on much longer, by the way, because you know, they're supposed to police their own town, but we're not going to let it go on much longer. (Applause.) Because at some point, we have to say, \"Okay, you've had enough time to police your town.\" And, by the way, they have good police. They have good , Portland has good police, but they're not , again, they're not allowed to do their job. If our opponents prevail, no one will be safe in our country, and no one will be spared. No one will be spared, including the people that help fund. They think they're going to be best pals; they're not going to be best pals. They'll be terminated, just like many others. I'm the only thing standing between the American Dream and total anarchy, madness, and chaos. And that's what it is. I'm representing you. I'm just here. And I'm not sure it's an enviable position, but that's what it is. (Applause.) That's what it is. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT: You know, when I made that statement, I was a little embarrassed by it because it sounds so egotistical. It's like an egotistical statement. And I was a little embarrassed: \"I'm the only one.\" But there was no other way to say it. We have to win the election. I'm the one. If we win, all of these things that we talked about: pro-life, by the way. By the way. (Applause.) Second Amendment, by the way. (Applause.) If we , if we don't win, it's all gone. Okay? It's all gone. And we mentioned , I have to mention life. All gone. Second Amendment, gone. It's all gone. And many other things. It will be a totally different country. It will be a totally different country, and ultimately, it will fail. It will fail. It can't work. Economically, it can't work. We'll go into a depression , and I'm very good at predicting these things. We will go into pre- , a depression, no different than , maybe worse , no different than what happened in 1929. Your stocks will crash, your 401(k)s will be worthless. This is going to happen. And the radical left will bring him along so quickly. I don't know if you saw the congresswoman the other day, where she said, \"He will do whatever I tell him to do. He's perfect. He will do whatever I tell him to do.\" This is a congresswoman. And Bernie Sanders was saying the same thing. Bernie Sanders was saying, \"Look, we'll just let him be in there, and then we'll , when he gets in, we'll take it over.\" That's what's going to happen, because that's where their party is. It's , it's become a sick ideology. And we have to win. We will solve the problem very quickly, very easily. We have to win. I don't like this mail-in ballot deal. They're going to send out 51 million mail-in ballots to people that haven't requested them. Well, where are they going? Look at what happened in New York with Carolyn Maloney, a cong- , a small race. And they declared her the winner. They don't even have the ballots. It's so mixed up, so fraudulent. And the only reason they declared her a winner is because , I was right up , I said, \"Wait, what's going on?\" Six weeks and they couldn't count the votes. That's one little race. What's going to happen when you have 150 million votes? And you have 51 million , 51 million votes , think of it: They're going to send out 51 million. It could be higher than that. Fifty-one million votes , no signature verification on many of them. In Nevada, no signature verification. In New Jersey, no signature verification. In New Jersey, the governor passed it and didn't even have the legislature approve it. He did it with an executive order, which is interesting. I mean, how do you do this? But think of it, just from , you don't have to know anything about politics. You don't have to know anything. Just common sense, right? And a lot of you are great businesspeople. Fifty-one million , it's not an absentee ballot where you request it, they send it, you send it back. It's , it's good, like in Florida. This is , 51 million people are going to get ballots to send in. So if it's them, let's say, that are doing it , and it's mostly Democrat states that want it and the Democrat governors , they're going to send them to certain areas, I guess. Right? I guess. So, people are going to be getting them and say, \"Oh, all right. That's fine.\" And they'll send it back. In some of them, harvesting is allowed , that's where you harvest them all together. In Nevada, harvesting is allowed. So they'll go all over the world and they'll get people to sign them. \"Hey, you used to be here.\" They go all over the world to get , and they'll harvest them, and they'll drop thousands of them on a table, just before the election. The other thing is, if you do this, you'll never have an election count on November 3rd. You know the way we enjoyed , well, we enjoyed; I'm not sure they did. They didn't enjoy it. (Laughter.) But, you know, the greatest evening ever was four years ago, right? (Applause.) And that night , that night, four years ago , that was an extraordinary night. But we knew that night , in fact, we knew it before , we really knew before nine o'clock, even though it took, like, two o'clock to call it. They refused to call Pennsylvania, which we had. If we lost every single vote , right? Remember: There was two points , two left. And , two points left. And if we lost every vote, we won Pennsylvania. They refused to call it. But they called Wisconsin, they called Michigan, they called places that haven't done, really, very well for Republicans. But, you know, if you look at Michigan now, we're building many car plants. They hadn't built car plants in 42 years. We're expanding and building car plants. I mean, a lot of good things are going to happen. But you're not going to be able to know the end of this election, in my opinion, for weeks, months , maybe never. It may be years, but maybe never. Because once you go past the first week, you're never going to know. What's going to happen? They're going to be taking them and hiding them. You saw what happened in Broward County, in Florida, where they were, every day, 10,000 gone , 10,000. Rick Scott , it was great the way he did that, and we helped them a lot. And Governor DeSantis, right? Ten thousand. Ten thousand. Ten , if we would've waited a couple of days, you wouldn't have had the same governor and you wouldn't have had the same senator. We took very strong action, because it was obvious what was going on. So now you're going to have 51 million ballots, Tom. Where is Tom? Hi, Tom. Where is he? Stand up, Tom. Where are you, Tom Fitton? I don't know. (Applause.) Does , he does , that's Judicial Watch. They do a fantas- , I don't know if everyone agrees, but I do. (Applause.) They do a fantastic job. I wish he had more help. I mean, honestly, I wish he had more help, but it's not easy beating a system that's been in place for many, many years, right? Many, many years it's been in place, and it's sad. But 51 million votes , it's being sent, and nobody knows who's getting them. And what happens if you send them to an all-Democrat area, but not to an all- Republican area? How do you win an election? This is, really, a very serious problem. This is beyond me. This is not to say \"me\" or , this is about all of us; this is about the country. This is about the country. It could happen the other way, too. I mean, it could happen the other way, too. I don't think it will happen the other way. I don't think it will. But I think this is a very disgraceful situation. I really don't think that you're going to know anything on the evening , anything meaningful or anything real on the evening of November 3rd. I don't think you're going to know anything. You're not going to know what happened. I don't think you'll know two weeks later. I don't think you'll know four weeks later. And I don't know what's going to happen. You know, there's a theory that if you don't have it by the end of the year, Crazy Nancy Pelosi would become President. You know that, right? AUDIENCE: Booo , THE PRESIDENT: No, no, think of that. Think of that. There's that mad theory, too. You , you have heard that theory. No, I don't know if it's a theory or a fact, but I said, \"That's not good.\" (Laughter.) That's not good. No, no, there is a theory that if you don't have it , and that's , that's part of their whole act; that if you don't have a choice, that the Speaker of the House becomes President. And that, I think, goes into effect either on the 20th or the 1st. And put that in the hopper. Add that to everything else. It's a disgrace. They know it's filthy, dirty. Paterson, New Jersey; Virginia; New York. Many, many cases all over the country just recent , I'm talking about recently. And it's not even the Post Office, although the mailmen become very popular people, I have to tell you that. That's happened too. That's happened too , even mailmen. But think about what they're doing to our country when they do this. We voted in World War One. We voted in World War Two. And now we can't vote anymore. And, you know, that's still a long time away. The pandemic is , if you look at Florida, if you look at Arizona, you look at California, those numbers are going down very rapidly. Many, many states have very little problem. You know, you look at a map now, it's , it's largely, really, in good shape. I mean, I'm going to talk about it in my speech on Thursday. We're , we've done a great job. We have not been recognized for what we've done. We've done a great job. (Applause.) So in two and a half months from now, we'll be in, you know, good shape, and we're going to be in, really , I think, potentially, really good shape. And we , we can't let this happen to our country. It's called universal mail-ins, okay? Universal , they like the word \"universal\" because it explains it. I don't know why. I personally don't like the name. I just call it \"mail-in.\" But we want to distinguish it from absentee voting, which is okay, which has gone on for a long time. And we're prepared for that, but we're not prepared for those 51 million ballots. It will be a tremendous embarrassment to our country. It'll go on forever, and you'll never know who won. So I say that for you, I say it for the cameras, because I assume that goes out. But I will tell you that this is a very serious problem for a great democracy. This is a very, very serious problem, and something has to be done about it. And they're being sent almost as we speak. People are going to get ballots that had no intention of voting; that maybe shouldn't be voting; that maybe aren't , and they say the computers will pick it up. The computers are going to pick up nothing. They're going to pick up nothing. You'll have double voting, where they send in a ballot and then they'll go and vote. That's going to be a big problem. They'll send in their ballot, and they'll vote too. They'll send in the ballot, and then they'll vote. What are the chances that some states so efficiently run , \"Oh, gee, you can't vote. We just got your ballot last night at seven o'clock.\" I mean, think of how ridiculous it is, right? Common sense. I say this for the media: This will be the greatest catastrophe , one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of our country. That's how serious it is. And they also think I'm trying to steal an election. Just the opposite: I want the fair results of an election. (Applause.) So the damage that they inflict will not just last a year or an election cycle; it will echo for generations. And we may never be able to escape, no matter how great our future leaders. We may never, ever escape from the damage that will be inflicted if the radical left takes over the presidency. We may never be able to , remember the Supreme Court , but we may never be able to do it; it'll be too late. The country will go down so far that you'll never, ever , I don't care who you are , be able to bring it back. There's now a major American political party that supports decriminalizing illegal border crossings, abolishing cash bail. If you kill somebody, no bail. They want to close all prisons, outlaw American energy, confiscate your guns, force taxpayers to finance late-term abortion. They want to ban charter schools, abolish school choice, destroy our beautiful suburbs. They want to destroy , I have done more for suburbia. When they talk about the \"suburban woman,\" will she vote for Trump? If she doesn't , I mean, what is she doing? They want to force low-income housing into suburbia. And now the one that wants to do it is Cory Booker. Cory Booker is a disaster. You saw him running for President. He eventually quit when he started getting below 1 percent. How about all these people? How about Kamala? Kamala runs. She's sort of one of the favorites. And she goes from 15 to 13 to 12 to 9 to 7, 5, 4. About 1, she got out. She didn't even get to Iowa. She never got there. She didn't want to take a vote. That's how bad she was. Don't you want to pick a person that's gone in the opposite direction? (Applause.) I mean, seriously. That's like a free poll. But there's something that , that's not good going on there. I don't think it was a good choice. It was my number- one draft pick; I did say that. They said, \"How do you like the choice?\" I said, \"That was my number-one draft pick.\" (Laughter.) That's , but I meant from my standpoint. (Laughter.) But think of it: She was one of the favorites, and she went down like a rock. So it's one of those things. I believe it's , one of the worst things going on now is the abolition of police or even the partial abolition of police. So we have to expose this dangerous left-wing movement. We must defeat it. And with an optimistic vision for America's future, we can be greater than ever before. We will be greater than ever before. With your help, that's exactly what we're going to do. We'll, once again, build the greatest economy in history. We had it. We had to let it go to save millions of lives, and now we're building it again. We'll fully restore America's manufacturing independence, bring home our critical supply chains, and permanently end our reliance on China. We're going to lower drug prices. (Applause.) We're going to lower drug prices at a level that's never been lowered before. You know, I'm the only President, in 51 years, that lowered , last year, drug prices went down a little bit. Not much, but a little bit. But under Obama and Biden, they went up 52 percent. Fifty-two percent. We'll create a healthcare system that protects vulnerable patients, lowers costs. We have transparency. It's already done; it's approved. It kicks into effect in January. This is going to lower your hospital stays, your doctor bills, gives you more choice and controls. And we're going to deliver the highest-quality care that our great American patients and people and seniors deserve. We'll provide school choice to every parent in America. (Applause.) We'll appoint more conservative judges and justices. (Applause.) We will protect religious liberty, defend the lives of the unborn , (applause) , uphold free speech, and safeguard the Second Amendment and your right to keep and bear arms. So important, right? (Applause.) We'll restore patriotic education to our schools. (Applause.) I mean, what they're teaching students today is incredible. They come home; it's like a different world. What is it , 1619 now? All of a sudden, they change. Now they're thinking about making another change because they don't like that. I don't know. So, I guess, 1492 , Columbus discovered America. (Applause) Fourteen- , you know, and that's what we all , 1492, Columbus discovered America, right? That's what it was, right? Now they want to sort of get that , and poor Columbus. They're ripping those , (laughter) , poor Christopher. Except in one tough, Italian neighborhood in New York, they didn't get away with it. (Applause.) Did you see that? Did you see it? The anarchist said, \"Let's get the hell out of here. This is dangerous. This is \" The anarchists left. No, that was one very tough, great area. We love , we love that area. I know it very well. They started surrounding it. They were all set. They had the ropes going, the whole deal. And all of a sudden, they said, \"Let's get out of here.\" (Laughter.) Great. Christopher Columbus. Can you believe it? Christopher Columbus. We will restore patriotic education to our schools and teach our children to love their country, honor our history, and respect our great American flag. (Applause.) So this is the vision we believe in. And with your help, your talent , and you have incredible talent in this room , and your devotion, this is the bright future, not the dark future that you saw last night and for the last four days. This is a bright future that we will deliver for all Americans. I promise you this: As long as I am the President of the United States, I will fight with every ounce of energy and strength, and I have no doubt that our country will be greater than ever before. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. It's a great honor. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. END 12:58 P.M.

(Applause.) You're really fantastic, and I want to thank you very much. You really are. Thank you very much and thank you, Bill. And thank you to the Council for National Policy. My brother, Robert, would have wanted me to be here today. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Together, we're committed to protecting the American people, preserving American values, defending America's heritage, and keeping America safe, strong, prosperous, and free. I want to thank Bob McEwen, Kelly Shackelford, and Jenny Beth Martin for your tremendous leadership of the CNP. You've done a fantastic job. We're also joined by Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, who's done incredibly: Chad Wolf. Where is Chad? (Applause.) Thank you very much, Chad. You're right in the heart of it, and you've got some big things coming. Very big things. Good job. Also, Lieutenant Governor, a friend of mine, Dan Patrick of Texas. Dan? (Applause.) Dan? Wherever you may be. What a great guy. Great family. Great son doing a tremendous job as U.S. Attorney. And many other state and local officials: I want to thank you all for being here. We have a lot of , a lot of horsepower here. A lot of firepower, you might want to say. But over the last week, the Democrats held the darkest and angriest and gloomiest convention in American history. They spent four straight days attacking America as racist and a horrible country that must be redeemed. Joe Biden grimly declared a season of American darkness. And yet, look at what we've accomplished. Until the plague came in, look at what we've accomplished. And now we're doing it again. (Applause.) It was the most successful period of time in the history of our country, from every standard. Look what we've accomplished. And now this plague comes in, and look at the way they talk. But look at what's happening and look at how we're shooting up. We call it a 'super V.' It's no longer a 'V'; it's a 'super V.' And they didn't think that could happen, and they're probably not happy about it. They want to punish American citizens instead of holding them high. Where Joe Biden sees American darkness, I see American greatness. We've seen heroic doctors and nurses racing into action to save lives. We've seen first responders helping strangers in need. We've seen the passage of historic legislation to save 50 million American jobs. We've mobilized American industry like never before. We've built military hospitals from scratch, produced lifesaving therapies, and we're on track to develop the most incredible, from a standpoint of time , record time , vaccines. We have vaccines. You'll be reading about them very soon. Way, way ahead of schedule. Years ahead of schedule. This would have been, where we are now, phase three trials, clinical trials. You wouldn't have been there in two or three years, if you went back to another administration. It's time to reject the anger and the hate of the Democrat Party. We have the biggest election coming up, of our lifetime. (Applause.) No party can lead America that spends so much time tearing down America. But the biggest part of last night's speech was what Joe Biden didn't talk about. He didn't talk about law enforcement. He didn't talk about bringing safety to Democrat-run cities that are totally out of control and they have no clue. China was never mentioned in any way, shape, or form. China will own our country, if he gets elected. They will own our country. And we're not going to let that happen. (Applause.) And you've seen the intelligence reports: China very much wants Joe Biden to win. That would be very insulting if they wanted me to win. I don't think so. (Laughter.) I don't think so. We've taken in billions and billions of dollars from China. We've given it to our farmers. We've given it to a lot. They had the worst year they've had in 67 years; we had the best year we ever had. We've demonstrated over the last four years the extraordinary gains that are possible while we stand strong for our beliefs, when we trust the wisdom of our Founders, and when we embrace America's destiny. It's a great destiny. With your help, we carried out the largest tax and regulation cuts, by far, in American history. And , (applause) , and they now want to quadruple tax us, and they want to quadruple, and beyond, the regulation cuts. And when we say 'tax' and we say 'regulation' and you say, 'Oh, tax cuts. That's so wonderful,' , but the people in this room that are the heads of industry , you have some very powerful people in this room , they know that the regulation cuts may have been even more important than the biggest tax cuts we've ever had. (Applause.) To build a highway in this country, it could take, in certain places, 18, 19, 20, even 21 years to get approved. This is not even thinkable. And we've got it now down to two, and we'll have it down to probably one. And it may get rejected for safety reasons or for environmental reasons. That's okay; it may happen. But we have it down , we will soon have it down to one year from as much as 21 years. We have cases that have just been disastrous. So I just wanted you to know some of the little details. But that's what we're working on. We'll have it down to one year to build a highway. You can do it all in one year. It doesn't have to take 21 years and cost 100 times more. Literally, I've seen 100 times more. We eliminated Obamacare's unfair individual mandate penalty, which is really the elimination of Obamacare. (Applause.) And to give to critically ill patients access to life-saving drugs, we passed a thing called , and hopefully nobody in this room will need it, but if you do, it's Right to Try. We have the greatest medicines, the greatest doctors and labs in the world. And we have things that won't be approved by the FDA for a little while, although I've cut that time now down in half. It used to be 12 years. Now we've cut it down in more than half. And you see that with the vaccines. You see it with the therapeutics. But Right to Try, where we have the right to now go in and use some of these very promising drugs. And the response has been unbelievable. What's happened and the lives saved have been really incredible. People used to leave for Asia. They used to leave for Europe. They used to leave for other places all over the world or they'd go home and die. They'd go home and die. If they had no money, they'd go home and die, which is most people. Now they sign a very short, simple document, and they have the right to try, and it's given them hope, and in many cases, it's given their life back. So it's been a great thing. These are things that nobody talks about but it's , (applause) , they've been trying to get that approved, by the way. Not as easy as it sounds. It's complicated because you have the insurance companies and the doctors and the hospitals, and the country itself doesn't want to get sued. And so not , not very easy. But they've been trying to get it approved by , for 41 years, they've been trying to get that. That's just one of many, many things that we've done. For 41 years. To provide our amazing veterans the care they deserve, we passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. Many, many decades, they've been trying to get that. (Applause.) Choice, meaning you wait on line and you can't see a doctor, and they would wait in line for a week or two weeks or five weeks. Sometimes they'd be ill, and they'd end up being terminally ill by the time they saw the doctor. And we're letting them go out, get a private doctor immediately, and we pay the bill. And we just got a 91 percent approval rating in the VA , the highest we've ever had by many points. Ninety-one percent. (Applause.) And VA Accountability sounds simple, but it's not. You couldn't let anybody go, no matter how they disrespected our great vets, no matter what they said to them, no matter how badly they treated them. I mean, we had sadists and we had thieves; we had a lot of bad people. You couldn't fire them under any circumstances. Under any circumstance, you couldn't fire them. And now we say, 'You: You're fired.' (Laughter and applause.) Both VA Accountability. And they've wanted to have that , they've wanted to have that , actually, they've let go of 9,000 people; replaced them with people that love our vets, want to take care of our vets. And great people. And we had a terrible thing going. You couldn't get them fired because, you know, civil service and unions and different things, you couldn't fire them. Now you can fire them, and you can fire them quickly if they're not doing the job. It's a big deal. And we don't talk about it a lot, nobody talks about it, but they've been trying to get those two things approved for more than four decades. And now they're done and they're approved. We ended the Obama-Biden administration's war on American energy. And the United States is now the leading producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. It's a big thing. (Applause.) And remember this: If you look at what they're doing , Biden , he wants to end fracking, end petroleum products , end petroleum. No natural gas, no nothing. End everything. And that's it. How does that work in Texas? How does that work in Pennsylvania? I was in Pennsylvania yesterday, a place that he said he was born in, which is true, but he left when he was like nine years old. (Laughter.) So he left a long time ago. Left , he left seven decades ago. (Laughter.) And he still calls it his home. And his real home is a place he never leaves anymore. (Laughter and applause.) He just never leaves. He never leaves the outskirts of that state. You'd think you'd go a little bit, you know. It's not that far. Never leaves. We'll figure it out pretty soon. But they want to end fracking. They want to end drilling. They want to end everything. They want to end all of that. So I said , think of it: They want to end oil. They want to end , and this is the way it is , guns. They want to take away Second Amendment, right? How about that? That alone should win you the election. Right? That alone. (Applause.) And , And I protected your Second Amendment. Did you think that was easy for the last four years? (Laughter.) Everyone is, 'Oh, look, he's wilting. He's wilting.' And , no, we're not wilting. And we've had people that were in tragedies, and they lost a son in a school and they lost a daughter, beautiful Meadow. And that gentleman has been a friend of mine , he knows exactly who I'm talking about. Beautiful Meadow. They're totally in favor. They've actually gotten hardline on Second Amendment. It's not one way. It's an incredible thing to see, actually. But we held totally strong, and it's always going to be with us. But if they get in, they will absolutely , either obliterate it to a point of no return or actually terminate it. And I have no doubt about it. I have absolutely no doubt about it. It's something we can't let happen , such a big part of our security and our safety , and your entertainment and all, but I say security and safety probably first, right? And God , it's an attack on God. It's an attack on religion. Did you see the man that got up and sang a very, very special phrase from a very, very special thing? And he left the word 'God' out and I was watching, and I said, 'Oh, he must have made a mistake.' I didn't think that he left it out. I thought maybe he , you know, that can happen. Maybe he made a mistake. He didn't make a mistake. That's where they're coming from. He left the word 'God' out. And that's where they're coming from. I withdrew from the one-sided Pari- , if you , if you see it, the Paris Climate , I call it the Paris Climate disaster. This was a way of , (applause) , this was a way of taking advantage of the United States. We wouldn't be able to drill; we wouldn't be able to frack; we wouldn't have energy. Russia went way back into the dirtiest years. China didn't even come into it until 2030 or 2035, and when they did, they came in very lightly. We came in immediately, and we would have had to close down many, many businesses in order to achieve the goals that they set, which are totally unrealistic. We would have , it was a disaster. And, you know, it's an amazing thing: When I did that and when I did a couple of others , the environmental bills, the Clean Waters Act. How about that? It sounds so beautiful. The theme is so beautiful. In fact, when I did it, I said I'm going to be killed on this one, and I did it. And I was surrounded by farmers and developers, builders that build houses, and others. And they never cried; they're very strong people. They never cried a day in their life. They were almost all crying. I said, 'What was ' , it was a big, strong guy , ' when was the last time you cried?' 'I can't remember, sir.' I gave them back their life. You know, that took away , (applause) , right? , that took away , that took away their life. And what we did in Minnesota with the iron ore: People came up to me and they said, 'You gave us back our life. Obama wrote it out.' Iron ore , the best in the world , he wrote it out. We gave it back to them. We went up to Maine; we gave them back their lobsters. We gave them back their fishing. (Applause.) Five thousand square miles. Think of what that is. Take one mile, mile by mile, and now you add five thou- , as big as the ocean is, that was a big chunk, right off the coast of Maine. Their whole thing is like lobsters and fishing, and nobody does it better. And they were not allowed. It was a monument; called a 'monument.' I said, 'A monument to what?' I said to the , when I was up in Maine two weeks ago, I said , (laughter) , I said to people that their whole life was lobster fishing , you know, the different things , and they're the best. I said, 'What happened?' They said, 'He took away our , took away our everything.' I said, 'How does this area compare to other areas?' He said, 'First of all, it takes a long time to get to the other areas, this is so big. But second of all, this is the best there is in the world, and he doesn't let us use it.' And I said, 'And yet, you vote Democrat.' And so I , (laughter) , (inaudible). It's like Israel. Look what I did for Israel. (Applause.) Thank you. But it's amazing to me because nobody has been worse to Israel than President Obama and Biden. Nobody. Nobody has been worse. Look at the Iran deal. It's the worst thing that ever happened to Israel. And they never moved the embassy to Jerusalem, thereby making Jerusalem the capital of Israel, which I did, and neither did any other president, and I understand why. They campaign on it, campaign. Every President said they were going to do; no President did it until I came along. (Applause.) And the pressure , and I will tell you, the pressure from other parts of the world was enormous. And I've told the story a few times where I just turned off my phone, and when the king calls and this one calls and that one calls , 'We're calling about Israel' , I say, 'Tell them I'll get back in a couple of days.' (Laughter.) 'I'll get back in a couple of days. I'll be in next week.' (Laughter.) Kings and queens and prime ministers and presidents and dictators , everybody was calling: 'Don't do it. Don't do it. It'll be bloodshed all over the Middle East.' Look what we just did , right? , with the United Arab Emirates and Israel. (Applause.) And now others will follow. And we couldn't have done that if we had the deal with Iran, but they said, 'Don't do it. Don't do it with Israel. Don't do it.' And I didn't take their call, and I did it. Had a ceremony. It was fine. Nothing happened. Remember? The world was going to blow up. 'This will be the end of the world.' So I held my breath, and I did it. And you know what happened? Nothing. Except we did something that should have been done many, many decades ago. And every President violated their promise, their campaign promise, except me. And I did it. By the way, I ended in Golan Heights; that was a big one too, by itself. (Applause.) And I did it, and, you know, it's incredible. I then call up these heads of state, many of whom are friends of mine. I get along , actually, you don't hear this from the fake news back there. A lot of , oh, there's a lot of a lot of press. A lot of press. But, you know, you don't hear this from the people back there, but I actually have very good relationships with leaders, with many of them. And some of them just take too much advantage of our country, including some of our so-called allies. You know, some of them are the worst for taking advantage of us. But you don't hear that. Then , so what I did is I called some of the leaders the following week. 'Hi. How you doing? What's up.' 'Oh, we wanted to talk to you about Israel, but you already did it.' I said, 'Oh, I wish I got to you a little bit sooner.' (Laughter.) But that's easier , that's easier than having somebody asking you over and over, 'Please don't do it.' But I could see there was a lot of pressure. I'd never understood why it wasn't done. It wasn't done because there's tremendous pressure put on the President of the United States by many other countries, much more than you would think and different countries than you would even think. Countries that you wouldn't think even cared about it were calling, asking not to do it. So we did it, and it's been really quite historic, I guess. And I could run in Israel, and I think they set up probably a 98 percent approval rating in Israel. (Laughter and applause.) So it's been , it's been good. And you know who appreciates it the most are the evangelical Christians. They appreciate it the most. (Applause.) So it's been , it's been quite a interest- , that was , that has been, just by itself , that's one thing out of many, many things, but that's been quite an interesting journey. But we also took historic action to stand up to China's trade cheating and plundering. You know that. We had the best year we ever had, and they've had the worst year they've had in 67 years. I wonder why. And I don't want them to have bad years, but there has been nobody that has ripped off the United States like China for so many years. How Presidents before me allow that to happen, and especially the one just before me. And Joe Biden, with his son walking out with $1.5 billion to manage , meaning, many millions of dollars a year in fees , is a disgrace, okay? He's a disgrace. (Applause.) And then the vast sums of money he was paid by Ukrainian , a Ukrainian company that didn't have the highest standing, to put it mildly, but the vast sums of money , if that ever happened to a Republican, they would have been in jail a long time ago. It's such a double standard , I can't tell you. This whole thing with all of the things that happened. The deep state , you can believe it; you don't have to believe it , but it's very unfair. And I will say that if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, with calling off the prosecutors or you're not going to get a billion dollars. And he's on tape; it's not like, 'Oh, gee.' I mean, he's on tape. We wouldn't have had a chance. It's a disgrace. The double standard is a disgrace. And hopefully it'll be brought back to fairness. And remember this: They spied on my campaign and they got caught. They can say what they want. This FBI agent has just now , first one , admitted. That's the beginning, hopefully, of the falling castle. But he's admitted that he forged documents. He changed documents, reversing them. And he admitted it. So let's see what's going to happen over the next, hopefully, short period of time, because it's been unfair that we've had to wait so long; that was so obvious for a long time. And it should never be allowed to happen to another President again , that, I can tell you. And that's for the good of the country, not for me. For the good of the country. (Applause.) Within three years, we replaced NAFTA , which everybody said was impossible to do , with the brand-new and really pro-America USMCA. It's a whole different ballgame, and we don't want to lose our companies to Mexico and Canada. And this puts a tremendous price tag on doing that if they want to do that. They won't be doing that. In everything we do, my administration is fighting for the American people and delivering one victory after another. We have appointed more than 230 federal judges. We expect to be perhaps over 300 federal judges by the end of the year. (Applause.) And there's , I can tell you, it's driving them crazy. (Laughter.) Don't forget, President Obama , they say he was a great President. Well, you can't be a great President when much of what he's done we've undone. And you can't be a great President when you leave 142 empty judgeships. You know, I don't think any President has left any. You don't leave , these are very, very important things for a party. Different policies, different everything. You understand it better than anybody, the people in this room. Left us 142. First day in office, I said, 'How many judges do I have to appoint?' 'Sir, you have 142.' I said, 'You have to be kidding.' (Laughter.) One hundred and forty , so I had a big head start. But we have 142, but now we will have, I think, in excess , by the time we finish , in excess of 300, including Court of Appeals. And, of course, two very exceptional Supreme Court justices. So it's really great. (Applause.) And remember this, in terms of, 'Get Out the Vote' , the next President, I think, could have anywhere from two to four, to maybe even five , just based on statistics; statistically , Supreme Court justices to pick. Think of that: I've had two. Some , some Presidents have had none because you, generally, pick them young, and they last a long time, right? They can last a long time. But , but we could have two to three to four, maybe even to five. It's probably a stretch, but four isn't a stretch at all. That would mean that the entire balance of the court doesn't just shift: It becomes dominant. So, if we , if we don't win, which we don't want to think about , we have to think positively. And the polls today, Rasmussen: 51 percent. And they were the ones that got it right last time. Them, and a few others. (Applause.) Fifty-one percent. They don't want to show those polls. They only want to show those polls , not 'likely' voters , 'registered voters.' What does that mean? Many are dead? (Laughter.) Many have switched their party affiliations. You know, 'registered.' They don't show 'likely.' But you see some of these polls where they interview many more Democrats than Republicans, and they have to, I guess, by law, put it in , you know, they interviewed , but many more. And they don't go 'likely.' Why don't they do 'likely' voters? Because I think they'd be very upset. I think they know they'd be very upset. Bottom line: We're doing very well. We have the biggest crowds. I think there's more enthusiasm now, for this election, than there was even , it's record enthusiasm, by the way. Record-setting enthusiasm, right now. It's more now than we had even four years ago. Does that make sense? (Applause.) And we had the same , we had the same thing, four years ago, where they'd say , but now we've done so much. You know, this is easier, in many ways. We were sailing , by the way, without the plague from China, this thing was over. This was over. We were sailing. But that came in, and then you have to prove yourself again. So now I have to prove myself again. But we're doing that. We're building up the economy. And we're way ahead, by every poll , even the fake polls , we're way ahead on the economy, which is very important. (Laughter.) But we are. I mean, think of it: You prove yourself. You're in this, and now you have to do it again. But that's what we're doing. We have the 'V.' We have the super 'V' we can talk about. But with the help of countless faith leaders , many of you are in the room; we appreciate it , we passed historic criminal justice reform. (Applause.) And nobody has done more for the black community or the Hispanic community than we have. Nobody. Nobody. (Applause.) I guess, maybe Lincoln. Questionable. Abraham Lincoln. But nobody has , I don't think anybody, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. But nobody has done more. If you look at Opportunity Zones, you look at all of the things we've done , nobody has done more. After years of neglect by both parties, my administration understands that a strong nation must have strong borders. (Applause.) By next week, we will have gone up to over, as I say, 300 miles. That's hard to believe. And that was tough. They didn't want it. Do you notice now that we're building it, you don't hear about it anymore? It's , (laughter). They don't want to talk about it anymore, and it's a bad issue for the Democrats because everyone knows walls work. You know, it's interesting: No matter , with all the technology and all the changes you see, you don't recognize a computer from five years ago. It's not even recognizable. Two things don't change, right? Walls and wheels. (Laughter.) And you can come back , you can come back in 2,000 years from now, and two things will still be around: wheels and walls. (Laughter.) Remember when they were saying, 'The wall doesn't do anything.' They wanted to have a drone flying around. You know, flying around (inaudible), so you could watch everybody pour into our country. (Laughter.) We've ended catch-and-release, one of the great scams of all time. (Applause.) Catch-and-release. We'd catch them and release them. They should say 'catch and release into our country' because you catch them, and then you release them, and you weren't allowed to bring them. Now we bring them back. We absolutely bring them back. We've dismantled drug smuggling and human trafficking of , these networks are horrible. (Applause.) The human trafficking in women, which has turned out , you think of it as almost an ancient crime, but it's not. It's bigger now, all over the world, than it's ever been because of the computer, because of the Internet. It's bigger now than ever before. It's a horrible thing. Much of it through the southern border. But all over the world, this is taking place, and we've brought it down to levels that nobody thought even possible. But it's a terrible thing. Mostly trafficking in women , children to a lesser extent, but women. We've removed 20,000 gang members, including 4,500 MS-13 members, and we brought them back to their countries. And their countries, under the Obama administration, didn't want to take people. You know that, right? They didn't want to take them. They'd say, 'No, don't bring them back here. We're not taking them.' Guatemala, El Salvador , right? , Honduras. They wouldn't want to , they wouldn't take people back. Now they take them back. They say, 'Oh, thank you very much.' (Applause.) The last administration left us with a Middle East in chaos. This was a Middle East in chaos. Iran was empowered and exporting terror. They don't have too much money now. They're not spending billions of dollars, giving it to al Qaeda, Hezbollah, some of these wonderful groups that are totally vicious, crazed lunatics. But Iran is different. It's having a hard time. Its GDP went down at a level that you wouldn't even believe , in the 20s , and they'll make a deal. I say they'll make a deal within a month, but I probably mean a week. But I just want to be right. (Laughter.) Because they'll call me. They'll say, 'It took 10 days. He was wrong.' (Laughter.) They just want to see , if I win, they'll be in making a deal. And if for some reason I don't, they'll take their time, and they will get one of the great deals, since the last one, where we paid them $150 billion. A billion. Gave them $150 for nothing. It wasn't even a long-term deal. It was , you know, right now, the time is almost up. This was like a short-term deal. It was like you rent a store in a shopping center. This , these are countries we're dealing with. You need length. But it was a short-term deal. But more importantly, we gave them $1.8 billion in cash. Think of that: Cash. Cash. We flew it in, in Boeing 757s loaded from floor to ceiling with cash. What were these people thinking? And had I kept that deal , we terminated that deal , had I kept that deal, we could never have started this incredible thing that's happening with UAE, Israel. And everybody is saying, 'Why haven't you invited us?' 'Okay, we're ' , many countries now want to come in. This was an impossible thing to even conceive of. Impossible. (Applause.) Even Tom Friedman at the New York Times gave us an A-plus. Can you believe it? He couldn't even believe it. I wouldn't say he's been a big fan. (Laughter.) But the New York Times gave us the best editorial I've had. I can't even believe it. I'm surprised they did it. I'm sure they've changed it by now, and they , (laughter). Somebody got in and they said, 'Who wrote that editorial?' They probably lost their job. But Tom Friedman actually wrote the editorial. It was very fair. It's true. He couldn't believe it. It's a , it's gotten great reviews from everybody: Wall Street Journal, Washington Post. Can you believe that one? Everybody gave it. And we couldn't have done that deal had we stayed in this horrible deal done by John Kerry, who just had no clue as to negotiation. He never got up. They would tell him, 'We want this, we want this, we want this ' And he'd sit there, and he'd agree to everything. Sometimes you have to get up and walk. He never got up and walked. Once he rode his bicycle , remember? , and he was in an accident. (Laughter.) I promised: At 73-years old, I said, 'I'll never be riding a bicycle.' He was , he had the helmet. He had the names, the insignias all over him. He had insignias like, you know, like he was a 20-year-old great cyclist from France. (Laughter.) So that delayed him about two months. They said, 'He just got hurt in a bicycle accident.' What? It's not a good accident when you're , so I promised I wouldn't do that. I might get hurt, but I'm not getting hurt riding a bicycle. (Laughter.) But if you look at the Obama administration, ISIS was rampaging all over. I've defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. (Applause.) Yesterday, we had the Prime Minister of Iraq in my office, and he made a statement. He said, 'Sir, I want to thank you. You have defeated ISIS.' I said, 'Wait a minute, when you say that ' Nobody ever says that. Those people back there don't say it. 'What do you mean by that?' He said, 'You.' I said, 'Do you mean Obama? Do you mean the United States?' 'Sir, Obama , it was a disaster. When you took over, ISIS was in 30 percent of our country. You came in, and you defeated.' I said, 'Would you please go public with that?' So, he said, 'I would.' He would. But it's true. I mean, we defeated 100 percent of the caliphate, and we turned it all around. We rebuilt the United States military , $2.5 trillion. We have a brand-new, beautiful military. (Applause.) And as I said, with Israel, you know, we , we got out of the Iran nuclear deal, which was such a horrible thing for Israel. But I asked a friend of mine who's a big fan of Israel , I said, 'So what was the best? Golan Heights, Jerusalem capital? What was , what was more important of the two?' Golan Heights, which they've been working on for 52 years , recognition of Golan Heights for Israel, right? Fifty-two years. Planes would fly in. They'd have summits every year or two. Planes would fly in. They'd talk. They'd talk. They kept talking. Two days later, the planes would fly out. Then they'd meet two years later. Fifty-two years they went through that. I got it done immediately. And I said, 'Which is more important: Golan Heights or Jerusalem capital?' And he said, 'Neither.' I said, 'What you mean 'neither'?' He said, 'The most important is when you withdrew from that horrible and very dangerous Iran nuclear deal. That was the greatest thing you did for Israel.' (Applause.) It's very interesting. And I said, 'I agree.' I actually said , I said, 'I agree.' We imposed the toughest-ever U.S. sanctions on Iran, and this week we invoked the snapback provisions to restore virtually all of the previously suspended U.N. sanctions. We snapped back , it's a good term. The founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, is dead. (Applause.) We killed him. And the world's top terrorist , probably over 50 years, the top terrorist , Qasem Soleimani , is dead. (Applause.) He's dead. He's gone. But the more success that we've achieved, the more unhinged the radical left has become. Anarchists and violent mobs have rioted in our Democrat-run cities, attacking our police, and tearing down statues. And, as you know, I signed a , a clause. I got an old bill. You know, when they used to do powerful things, when they knew what the hell they were doing. (Laughter.) I took an old bill, and I gave a nice, beautiful, brand-new executive order. It says, very easily , could you imagine getting this today? , you rip down a statue, a federal statue, you go to jail , prison; they use the term 'prison' , you go to prison for 10 years. (Applause.) And I remember there was a big march on Washington. They were coming in to knock a lot of statues down. And they had a , they even had Thomas Jefferson planned. That was in their planning. No, thanks. George Washington. They were even thinking about Lincoln. You know, Lincoln did sort of a pretty good job, right? (Laughter.) But they were talking about anybody. I don't even know if they knew what they were doing. They were just wild and out of control. But I signed this , 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue. We have people right now in jail that are going to trial, by the way. And that was from previous to signing. (Applause.) But, if you remember, that was a big thing two and a half months ago. You know when I signed it? Two and a half months ago. (Laughter.) Two and a half months ago, I signed it. We haven't had a problem since. They say, 'You know, we want to knock down that statue, but, you know, 10 years , let's see. Ten years. That's a lot of time. That's a lot of time.' (Applause.) Which tells you that, you know, laws, if properly utilized, can stop all of this madness. And that's why we have to give our great police back their dignity and their power. (Applause.) I've been endorsed by almost every police organization in the country. We just got, the other day , Pat Lynch, the head of New York City Police, endorsed me. First endorsement , he said, to the best of his knowledge, which is a lot of knowledge, the first time they've ever endorsed a candidate for President. That's good. They don't endorse. The first time ever. (Applause.) All the sheriffs in Florida. Dan can tell you: all of the law enforcement in Texas, right? All of the law enforcement in Texas, Dan. So, it's good. And just about everywhere, we have tremendous support. And you're always going to have bad apples, by the way. You've got some bad apples. And you're going to have it , probably, in this room, we might have one or two. But you have bad apples. But these are great people that do a phenomenal job, that actually are appreciated by the public. By the public, they're appreciated, and they're loved and they're respected. And the public doesn't want to happen what's happening to our police. They took away their dignity, they took away their right to do the job that they want to do, and they're doing the job now. And, for me, they do the job. And you look at most cities in our country , you know, crime is actually down. You look at Chicago, and you say, 'How is that possible?' You look at New York, what's happened just in a short period of time. But we're with them, and they're with us, and they've done a fantastic job. All right? (Applause.) So the future of our country, and indeed our civilization, is at stake on November 3rd. Earlier this summer, murders rose by 29 percent in New York City, 33 percent in Philadelphia, 53 percent in Chicago, 133 percent in Minneapolis. These are all Democrat-run places. These are Democrat-run , I might say 'radical-left Democrat,' in some cases. But these are people that don't have any clue what they're doing. They have no idea. I don't even think they know that it's bad, what's going on. You know, you'd almost say they're trying to defend it. It's incredible to hear them. But that's why I launched Operation LeGend, which has led to the arrest of 1,500 criminals since July. And the radical left spent four years trying to illegally overturn the last election; they're still trying to overturn. Hillary Clinton , remember the , Hillary Clinton: 'Will you honor the election?' (Laughter.) Right? The results of the election. That was Hillary Clinton. And she should have asked that question to herself. (Laughter.) She's like a crazed lunatic. She's a lunatic. (Applause.) She is something, I'll tell you. But somebody said, 'What's the difference between Clinton and Biden?' Should I say? Should I tell you? Well, Clinton is much smarter, but not a likable person. Joe is not nearly as smart, but he's more likable. So, you know, I don't know, maybe I'd rather have the smarter person. (Laughter.) Who cares about personality, right? But that's the difference. Very simple, isn't it? Huh? It's a very simple thing. But that's why we have to win. We have to win. (Applause.) So now the Democrats are planning to permanently alter our political system so their control is never threatened again. They want to pack the court with radical-left justices; abolish the filibuster, which, frankly, I wish we did it because I said, 'They're going to do it, so we might as well get there first.' But I couldn't get a couple of people to go along with me. But, you know, my attitude was, 'Schumer is going to do it.' And they all said, 'No, he'll never do that. He'll never do that.' Guess what? They're doing it. They're doing it. And as much as we've done , we've done more than anybody has ever done in three and a half years. But you know what? As much as we've done , we would have done more had we done that, because getting those extra 10 votes was almost impossible with these people. Almost impossible. So I wish we had done it. I wanted to do it, but we had some obstacle and obstacles. Will grant , they want to grant mass amnesty for millions of people. And citizenship, they want to give too many million illegal aliens , probably about 11 million, at least , and abolish , they want to abolish voter ID. They want to abolish voter ID. To get into the DNC convention last night, you needed an ID with your picture on it. Now, what does that tell you about , (laughter) , no, to get in last night, a friend of mine was saying , a friend of mine who happened to be there. I said, 'Why were you there?' (Laughter.) And , no, a very political person. But he shows me , he said, 'Here's the ID. It's got my picture. It's like the most incredible ' It's a disgrace. There's only one reason they don't want voter ID, and that's because they want to cheat. That's all. It cannot be anything else. (Applause.) I mean, you have it on everything. You have it on driver's licenses. You have it on everything, just about. And the only thing , the only one they don't want it on is a vote, which is your most important , the most important thing you have is your vote. And they don't want it. We have it in some states , Indiana. You know, we have some great, really, voter ID. They want to abolish it where it is and never allow it to happen again. And that's only a bad , that's only a bad thing. That's only a bad thing. To everyone in this room, your organization was formed at a time when conservatives led the fight to turn back the tide of communism abroad, communism here. It's a very important organization. Now Americans must rally to turn back the radical-left socialists and Marxists right here at home. And you see that when you see these people rioting in Portland, where you see the anger, the craziness. These people are crazy. They're crazy. And we won't let it go on much longer, by the way, because you know, they're supposed to police their own town, but we're not going to let it go on much longer. (Applause.) Because at some point, we have to say, 'Okay, you've had enough time to police your town.' And, by the way, they have good police. They have good , Portland has good police, but they're not , again, they're not allowed to do their job. If our opponents prevail, no one will be safe in our country, and no one will be spared. No one will be spared, including the people that help fund. They think they're going to be best pals; they're not going to be best pals. They'll be terminated, just like many others. I'm the only thing standing between the American Dream and total anarchy, madness, and chaos. And that's what it is. I'm representing you. I'm just here. And I'm not sure it's an enviable position, but that's what it is. (Applause.) That's what it is. You know, when I made that statement, I was a little embarrassed by it because it sounds so egotistical. It's like an egotistical statement. And I was a little embarrassed: 'I'm the only one.' But there was no other way to say it. We have to win the election. I'm the one. If we win, all of these things that we talked about: pro-life, by the way. By the way. (Applause.) Second Amendment, by the way. (Applause.) If we , if we don't win, it's all gone. Okay? It's all gone. And we mentioned , I have to mention life. All gone. Second Amendment, gone. It's all gone. And many other things. It will be a totally different country. It will be a totally different country, and ultimately, it will fail. It will fail. It can't work. Economically, it can't work. We'll go into a depression , and I'm very good at predicting these things. We will go into pre- , a depression, no different than , maybe worse , no different than what happened in 1929. Your stocks will crash, your 401(k)s will be worthless. This is going to happen. And the radical left will bring him along so quickly. I don't know if you saw the congresswoman the other day, where she said, 'He will do whatever I tell him to do. He's perfect. He will do whatever I tell him to do.' This is a congresswoman. And Bernie Sanders was saying the same thing. Bernie Sanders was saying, 'Look, we'll just let him be in there, and then we'll , when he gets in, we'll take it over.' That's what's going to happen, because that's where their party is. It's , it's become a sick ideology. And we have to win. We will solve the problem very quickly, very easily. We have to win. I don't like this mail-in ballot deal. They're going to send out 51 million mail-in ballots to people that haven't requested them. Well, where are they going? Look at what happened in New York with Carolyn Maloney, a cong- , a small race. And they declared her the winner. They don't even have the ballots. It's so mixed up, so fraudulent. And the only reason they declared her a winner is because , I was right up , I said, 'Wait, what's going on?' Six weeks and they couldn't count the votes. That's one little race. What's going to happen when you have 150 million votes? And you have 51 million , 51 million votes , think of it: They're going to send out 51 million. It could be higher than that. Fifty-one million votes , no signature verification on many of them. In Nevada, no signature verification. In New Jersey, no signature verification. In New Jersey, the governor passed it and didn't even have the legislature approve it. He did it with an executive order, which is interesting. I mean, how do you do this? But think of it, just from , you don't have to know anything about politics. You don't have to know anything. Just common sense, right? And a lot of you are great businesspeople. Fifty-one million , it's not an absentee ballot where you request it, they send it, you send it back. It's , it's good, like in Florida. This is , 51 million people are going to get ballots to send in. So if it's them, let's say, that are doing it , and it's mostly Democrat states that want it and the Democrat governors , they're going to send them to certain areas, I guess. Right? I guess. So, people are going to be getting them and say, 'Oh, all right. That's fine.' And they'll send it back. In some of them, harvesting is allowed , that's where you harvest them all together. In Nevada, harvesting is allowed. So they'll go all over the world and they'll get people to sign them. 'Hey, you used to be here.' They go all over the world to get , and they'll harvest them, and they'll drop thousands of them on a table, just before the election. The other thing is, if you do this, you'll never have an election count on November 3rd. You know the way we enjoyed , well, we enjoyed; I'm not sure they did. They didn't enjoy it. (Laughter.) But, you know, the greatest evening ever was four years ago, right? (Applause.) And that night , that night, four years ago , that was an extraordinary night. But we knew that night , in fact, we knew it before , we really knew before nine o'clock, even though it took, like, two o'clock to call it. They refused to call Pennsylvania, which we had. If we lost every single vote , right? Remember: There was two points , two left. And , two points left. And if we lost every vote, we won Pennsylvania. They refused to call it. But they called Wisconsin, they called Michigan, they called places that haven't done, really, very well for Republicans. But, you know, if you look at Michigan now, we're building many car plants. They hadn't built car plants in 42 years. We're expanding and building car plants. I mean, a lot of good things are going to happen. But you're not going to be able to know the end of this election, in my opinion, for weeks, months , maybe never. It may be years, but maybe never. Because once you go past the first week, you're never going to know. What's going to happen? They're going to be taking them and hiding them. You saw what happened in Broward County, in Florida, where they were, every day, 10,000 gone , 10,000. Rick Scott , it was great the way he did that, and we helped them a lot. And Governor DeSantis, right? Ten thousand. Ten thousand. Ten , if we would've waited a couple of days, you wouldn't have had the same governor and you wouldn't have had the same senator. We took very strong action, because it was obvious what was going on. So now you're going to have 51 million ballots, Tom. Where is Tom? Hi, Tom. Where is he? Stand up, Tom. Where are you, Tom Fitton? I don't know. (Applause.) Does , he does , that's Judicial Watch. They do a fantas- , I don't know if everyone agrees, but I do. (Applause.) They do a fantastic job. I wish he had more help. I mean, honestly, I wish he had more help, but it's not easy beating a system that's been in place for many, many years, right? Many, many years it's been in place, and it's sad. But 51 million votes , it's being sent, and nobody knows who's getting them. And what happens if you send them to an all-Democrat area, but not to an all- Republican area? How do you win an election? This is, really, a very serious problem. This is beyond me. This is not to say 'me' or , this is about all of us; this is about the country. This is about the country. It could happen the other way, too. I mean, it could happen the other way, too. I don't think it will happen the other way. I don't think it will. But I think this is a very disgraceful situation. I really don't think that you're going to know anything on the evening , anything meaningful or anything real on the evening of November 3rd. I don't think you're going to know anything. You're not going to know what happened. I don't think you'll know two weeks later. I don't think you'll know four weeks later. And I don't know what's going to happen. You know, there's a theory that if you don't have it by the end of the year, Crazy Nancy Pelosi would become President. You know that, right? No, no, think of that. Think of that. There's that mad theory, too. You , you have heard that theory. No, I don't know if it's a theory or a fact, but I said, 'That's not good.' (Laughter.) That's not good. No, no, there is a theory that if you don't have it , and that's , that's part of their whole act; that if you don't have a choice, that the Speaker of the House becomes President. And that, I think, goes into effect either on the 20th or the 1st. And put that in the hopper. Add that to everything else. It's a disgrace. They know it's filthy, dirty. Paterson, New Jersey; Virginia; New York. Many, many cases all over the country just recent , I'm talking about recently. And it's not even the Post Office, although the mailmen become very popular people, I have to tell you that. That's happened too. That's happened too , even mailmen. But think about what they're doing to our country when they do this. We voted in World War One. We voted in World War Two. And now we can't vote anymore. And, you know, that's still a long time away. The pandemic is , if you look at Florida, if you look at Arizona, you look at California, those numbers are going down very rapidly. Many, many states have very little problem. You know, you look at a map now, it's , it's largely, really, in good shape. I mean, I'm going to talk about it in my speech on Thursday. We're , we've done a great job. We have not been recognized for what we've done. We've done a great job. (Applause.) So in two and a half months from now, we'll be in, you know, good shape, and we're going to be in, really , I think, potentially, really good shape. And we , we can't let this happen to our country. It's called universal mail-ins, okay? Universal , they like the word 'universal' because it explains it. I don't know why. I personally don't like the name. I just call it 'mail-in.' But we want to distinguish it from absentee voting, which is okay, which has gone on for a long time. And we're prepared for that, but we're not prepared for those 51 million ballots. It will be a tremendous embarrassment to our country. It'll go on forever, and you'll never know who won. So I say that for you, I say it for the cameras, because I assume that goes out. But I will tell you that this is a very serious problem for a great democracy. This is a very, very serious problem, and something has to be done about it. And they're being sent almost as we speak. People are going to get ballots that had no intention of voting; that maybe shouldn't be voting; that maybe aren't , and they say the computers will pick it up. The computers are going to pick up nothing. They're going to pick up nothing. You'll have double voting, where they send in a ballot and then they'll go and vote. That's going to be a big problem. They'll send in their ballot, and they'll vote too. They'll send in the ballot, and then they'll vote. What are the chances that some states so efficiently run , 'Oh, gee, you can't vote. We just got your ballot last night at seven o'clock.' I mean, think of how ridiculous it is, right? Common sense. I say this for the media: This will be the greatest catastrophe , one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of our country. That's how serious it is. And they also think I'm trying to steal an election. Just the opposite: I want the fair results of an election. (Applause.) So the damage that they inflict will not just last a year or an election cycle; it will echo for generations. And we may never be able to escape, no matter how great our future leaders. We may never, ever escape from the damage that will be inflicted if the radical left takes over the presidency. We may never be able to , remember the Supreme Court , but we may never be able to do it; it'll be too late. The country will go down so far that you'll never, ever , I don't care who you are , be able to bring it back. There's now a major American political party that supports decriminalizing illegal border crossings, abolishing cash bail. If you kill somebody, no bail. They want to close all prisons, outlaw American energy, confiscate your guns, force taxpayers to finance late-term abortion. They want to ban charter schools, abolish school choice, destroy our beautiful suburbs. They want to destroy , I have done more for suburbia. When they talk about the 'suburban woman,' will she vote for Trump? If she doesn't , I mean, what is she doing? They want to force low-income housing into suburbia. And now the one that wants to do it is Cory Booker. Cory Booker is a disaster. You saw him running for President. He eventually quit when he started getting below 1 percent. How about all these people? How about Kamala? Kamala runs. She's sort of one of the favorites. And she goes from 15 to 13 to 12 to 9 to 7, 5, 4. About 1, she got out. She didn't even get to Iowa. She never got there. She didn't want to take a vote. That's how bad she was. Don't you want to pick a person that's gone in the opposite direction? (Applause.) I mean, seriously. That's like a free poll. But there's something that , that's not good going on there. I don't think it was a good choice. It was my number- one draft pick; I did say that. They said, 'How do you like the choice?' I said, 'That was my number-one draft pick.' (Laughter.) That's , but I meant from my standpoint. (Laughter.) But think of it: She was one of the favorites, and she went down like a rock. So it's one of those things. I believe it's , one of the worst things going on now is the abolition of police or even the partial abolition of police. So we have to expose this dangerous left-wing movement. We must defeat it. And with an optimistic vision for America's future, we can be greater than ever before. We will be greater than ever before. With your help, that's exactly what we're going to do. We'll, once again, build the greatest economy in history. We had it. We had to let it go to save millions of lives, and now we're building it again. We'll fully restore America's manufacturing independence, bring home our critical supply chains, and permanently end our reliance on China. We're going to lower drug prices. (Applause.) We're going to lower drug prices at a level that's never been lowered before. You know, I'm the only President, in 51 years, that lowered , last year, drug prices went down a little bit. Not much, but a little bit. But under Obama and Biden, they went up 52 percent. Fifty-two percent. We'll create a healthcare system that protects vulnerable patients, lowers costs. We have transparency. It's already done; it's approved. It kicks into effect in January. This is going to lower your hospital stays, your doctor bills, gives you more choice and controls. And we're going to deliver the highest-quality care that our great American patients and people and seniors deserve. We'll provide school choice to every parent in America. (Applause.) We'll appoint more conservative judges and justices. (Applause.) We will protect religious liberty, defend the lives of the unborn , (applause) , uphold free speech, and safeguard the Second Amendment and your right to keep and bear arms. So important, right? (Applause.) We'll restore patriotic education to our schools. (Applause.) I mean, what they're teaching students today is incredible. They come home; it's like a different world. What is it , 1619 now? All of a sudden, they change. Now they're thinking about making another change because they don't like that. I don't know. So, I guess, 1492 , Columbus discovered America. (Applause) Fourteen- , you know, and that's what we all , 1492, Columbus discovered America, right? That's what it was, right? Now they want to sort of get that , and poor Columbus. They're ripping those , (laughter) , poor Christopher. Except in one tough, Italian neighborhood in New York, they didn't get away with it. (Applause.) Did you see that? Did you see it? The anarchist said, 'Let's get the hell out of here. This is dangerous. This is ' The anarchists left. No, that was one very tough, great area. We love , we love that area. I know it very well. They started surrounding it. They were all set. They had the ropes going, the whole deal. And all of a sudden, they said, 'Let's get out of here.' (Laughter.) Great. Christopher Columbus. Can you believe it? Christopher Columbus. We will restore patriotic education to our schools and teach our children to love their country, honor our history, and respect our great American flag. (Applause.) So this is the vision we believe in. And with your help, your talent , and you have incredible talent in this room , and your devotion, this is the bright future, not the dark future that you saw last night and for the last four days. This is a bright future that we will deliver for all Americans. I promise you this: As long as I am the President of the United States, I will fight with every ounce of energy and strength, and I have no doubt that our country will be greater than ever before. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. It's a great honor. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much."}

Thank you. Oklahoma loves you Mr. President. Thank you very much. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Now if you want to really drive them crazy, you say 12 more years. 12 more years. 12 more years. Because we caught them doing some really bad things in 2016. Let's see what happens. We caught them doing some really bad things. We have to be very careful because they're trying it again with this whole 80 million mail-in ballots that they're working on, sending them out to people that didn't ask for them, they didn't ask, they just get them and it's not fair and it's not right and it's not going to be possible to tabulate in my opinion. It's just my opinion. We have to be very, very careful, and you have to watch. Every one of you, you have to watch. Because bad things happened last time with the spying on our campaign and that goes to Biden and that goes to Obama and we have to be very, very careful. Have to be very, very careful, and this time they're trying to do it with the whole Post Office scam. They'll blame it on the Post Office. You can see them setting it up. Be very careful and watch it very carefully. Because we have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country. This is the most ... For a long period of time, I would say, \"Well 2016, how special was that evening? Was that one of the great ...\" That was one of the great evenings but we have to be very, very careful and we have to win. Our country is counting on it. This is the biggest, this is it. Our country can go in a horrible, horrible direction or in an even greater direction and before the plague came in from China, that's where we were going. We were going in a direction like we had never seen. The most successful economy in the history of our country, the best unemployment numbers in history for African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, women, college students, bad students, good students, everybody. If you had a diploma, if you didn't have a diploma, didn't matter, you were doing well. Everybody was doing well and we were actually coming together. You know success brings people together, maybe better than anything else. Success brings people, so many times they say we're divided. Well we were very divided under President Obama, very divided. People have no idea how divided. They didn't talk about it as much, they didn't say it as much, but we were really coming together and I was speaking with Democrats all of a sudden because the success, the markets were at an all-time high and by the way, take a look at what's happening with the markets. Take a look at your 401(k)s which you probably do every hour. Take a look at your stocks. We're very close to breaking the record and NASDAQ has already done it. You know NASDAQ has broken the record I think 16 times already during a pandemic. Hopefully we'll call it the final phase of the pandemic. Biden the other day said no he'd shut it down. He'd listen to some guy say and he'd shut it down. We just broke a record on jobs, an all-time record. There's never been three months where we've put more people to work, over nine million people, and again, we're just about ready to break the all-time stock market record. I mean you look at it, we're just about ready to do it again and what that means is everything else is going to follow. Very small on Wall Street. Everything else is going to be there, the economy is coming up very rapidly, our farmers are doing well. Our farmers are doing well because I got China to give them $28 billion because they were targeted by China. I got the farmers $28 billion, 16 and 12. That's why. So in spite of the pandemic and our farmers did a great job in supplying food and all the difficulties during this period of time, but we're getting ready to do things like nobody has ever seen before, but the best way to bring unity is success. Success brings unity and we were there, and then we got hit with the plague but we won't forget that. I just want to thank the people of North Carolina because to be honest with you, I felt an obligation to be here. You have a governor is in a total shutdown mood. I guarantee you on November 4 it will all open up, it will be fine like most Southern states. On November 4, you know these Democrat governors, they love shutdown until after the election's over because they want to make our numbers look as bad as possible for the economy but our numbers are looking so good and frankly I used to say a V and people would say, \"Well maybe not. I don't think so.\" Some would say no way. We have a super V, you're right. It's now looking like it's a super V. Our automobile numbers are incredible, both used cars and brand new cars, our manufacturing number is incredible. We're putting a lot of manufacturing jobs to work that the previous administration said you'd need a magic wand. You'd need a magic wand for manufacturing jobs, I don't think so. I guess we had the magic wand, that's all, but again, we're putting them back, we're bringing them back. But think of your life just prior to the plague coming in. It was the best it's ever been. Your state had the best numbers they've ever had, ever had, by far, and we had the best employment numbers also. We were up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere near that, and then we had to shut it down. We saved millions and millions of lives. We learned the enemy, we learned all about the invisible enemy, how it affects really people that are older, especially older people, the elderly, but older people with problems with heart and diabetes, with other problems, and we learned and most of the country is right now doing very, very well. They've done an incredible job and to have a man sitting on television the other day say, \"Oh I'd shut it down. Oh I'd shut it.\" Like it's easy, shut it down. By the way, when you shut it down and we did the exact right thing, we shut it down, then we reopened and that's what we're doing now. We're well into it, but ... If we didn't shut it down at that point, we would have had millions of people dead. Millions of people. You see the numbers, the job that Mike Pence and the taskforce and all of us together have done has been incredible, what we've done, what we've achieved, whether it's ventilators, whether it's supplying equipment to governors that were totally ill-prepared. Many of the governors were totally ill-prepared. Nobody wants to say that but it's supposed to work that way, federalist, it's supposed to work that way. The governors are supposed to do it, and many of them did a fine job and many of them came back well. But most of them didn't have the equipment that they should have had. Few of them had the ventilators which are very, very complex machines and hard to make and hard to manufacture and expensive and we're right now making thousands of ventilators a month and we're sending them, we have all we can use, our whole country, every state. We're stocked, we're stocked and I always say and I'll say it again, there's never been a person that needed a ventilator that didn't get a ventilator. Every single person that's ever needed a ventilator, with all that you've heard with how much they said we didn't have again, I took over a country whose military was depleted and whose cupboard on this front were bare. The cupboards were bare. We didn't have anything. We didn't have a thing. We had very, very little and we did a great job. We haven't been given ... And it's not for me, it's for the incredible people, the generals, the admirals, the doctors, the nurses and yet you saw yesterday convalescent plasma, you saw remdesivir. You'll soon see vaccines pouring out years ahead of what they would have been under a more traditional, let's use that term because it's nicer, a more traditional administration where they would have taken years to come up with this stuff. We're coming up with it like nobody's ever seen before. The FDA, Dr. Hahn I want to thank him, Alex Azar, I want to thank him. They've come with things and done things that have never been done in terms of speed and frankly in terms of quality. If you look at it what we're doing and what we're coming up with, drug companies are coming up with vaccines that are ... I've seen some results already, it's going to be very, very soon. They're in Stage III trials. It's unheard of. We wouldn't be there for two years if this were a more normal situation. So I just want to thank everybody for being here and again I felt an obligation to come to North Carolina. It's been a place that's been very good to me. You know we won a lot of victories here. I haven't been doing this that long but I won every chance I had in North Carolina. I even stole a great chief of staff, Mark Meadows, right? I stole him from North Carolina, and he left Congress as a very popular guy. Could have been there for a long time if he wanted and he came in and by the way, you have a fantastic young gentleman going to take his place, he's a fantastic young guy and he's going to be a real star in the party. He's going to be a real star in the party. So I just want to thank everybody from North Carolina and I do want to show a little bit of a difference because another state that's been very good to me is Wisconsin and Joe Biden was going to have their convention in Milwaukee and they didn't go there at all, they didn't do this. We did this out of respect for your state. We didn't do this for any other reason other than respect for the state of North Carolina. Because we said we wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina and I think you're going to remember that frankly on November 3. We wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina. So I did that out of respect, and if you had a governor that would have let us have some people. He actually told me this, we had an arena that holds 19,000 people, it was totally jammed, sold out, every hotel was full, everything, and I called him, he said, \"But we have a shutdown going on and according to the rules and regulations ...\" Now this is 19,000, he did say it. I don't think he'll deny it, but he said, \"According to the rules and regulations, the most people you're allowed to have in that room,\" meaning that arena, he viewed it as a room, \"Is 10 people.\" I say, \"So Governor, so I'm at 19,000, you're at 10. Can we work something in the middle.\" It didn't sound too good, so we really had no choice. It was a terrible thing but I felt so badly because you could have ... I mean economic development money, all of the things that happen, but we decided, I was with Ronna, the vice president, everybody, Mark, and we said let's have our big deal, the roll call, let's have it right here and let's do it and I'm going to show up and I'm not going to tell anybody. Until a few minutes ago nobody knew I was coming. Nobody knew I was coming. But what's more important than the roll call? You're the ones calling it so what's more important - We love you Mr. President. We love you. I have to tell you, we're going to do a lot of things. I'm just going to go over very briefly because we're going to make a speech on Thursday night, I hope you're all going to be listening. Because I came in, I'm on Air Force One and Air Force One has more televisions that any plane in history. They've got them in closets, they've got them on ceilings, floors. They've got more ... You can't escape a television, and I turned to CNN and they didn't have this. They weren't having it, can you believe it? They didn't have it. No no, CNN didn't have our roll call. Then I turned to MSDNC as I call it. MSDNC which is truly, it is a branch of the Democrats. It's a I wouldn't say fully owned corporation but it's certainly a fully controlled or they control them, nobody really knows who's controlling who but they had it on television. I remember watching it, it was interesting. You see the difference states and we say this and we say that, the great state of Alaska, the great state of Alabama, the great state of North Carolina, the great state of all of them, and it's very interesting - ... Carolina. The great state of all of them. And it's very interesting to me. They had theirs on, but they didn't show it. Instead, they're showing the scam because they're trying to show the post office so that when their whole mail-in thing fizzles, they'll try blaming it on the post office. Okay. So they show in these hearings that are very boring actually and they're not showing you this either. They weren't showing this. And Fox had it on, but unfortunately, Fox wasn't showing it too much because they had the announcers talking, talking, talking. I said, \" I want to hear what they're saying, the delegates. I want to hear what they're saying.\" So I think we had to switch over to CSPAN or to OAN or somebody. But I wanted to hear them. But I can promise you a few things. Number one, we will not be taking the word, God, out of The Pledge of Allegiance. Okay. Like they did a number of times at their caucuses, so they took the word God out. I heard it. I was listening and I said, \"That's strange.\" It's sort of weird. You've heard it all your life, right? Under God, under God. All of a sudden, those two words are missing. I said, \"Oh, he must've made a mistake.\" Maybe the teleprompter wasn't working or his book wasn't working that I have right here. Something wasn't working. I must admit. But the problem was then the next day I heard it again. And I said, \"That's not a mistake.\" And then they immediately went into a mode, \"Oh, no, no, no, no. We didn't mean that. No, no. We didn't say if for the convention. We didn't say it.\" No, that's where they're coming from. That's where they're coming from. You can say it or not say it. That is where they're coming from. Just like with energy, they don't want energy. Not working well in Texas, by the way. I just looked at a poll. And by the way, it just came out that we have received 51% in the big and very important Rasmussen poll, and my numbers actually went up during the Democratic National Convention, 51%. So, think of it. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Thank you. Four more years. I love this state. Four more years. Think of it- Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Thank you. Four more years. I love this state. I like this place and you're from all over the place. But this has been a good one for me. No, but think of it, so we're at 51% in Rasmussen. Do you read about it? Do you hear about it?. You don't hear about it. They give you these suppression polls, where they do registered voters instead of most likely. It's supposed to be likely, likely. In other words, how about you, you're likely to vote. But how about you, you're registered, but I'm not voting. But see, under their plan where they send these ballots, you don't have to want to vote. You get the ballot and then they have harvesting. They get guys to go, \"Do you want to vote?\" \"No, not really, but I have a ballot.\" \"All right, good. Who's it for?\" \"Sleepy Joe Biden.\" \"Now put it here, sign. Okay. Could I have it?\" And they'll take it. In fact, harvesting is illegal in your state. They wanted to put a Republican, a fine man, a pastor, they wanted to put them in jail because he harvested. Now they want to make harvesting legal all of a sudden. They'll put him in jail as a Republican, right? If he was a Democrat, they wouldn't even be thinking about it. In California, they do the same thing. No repercussion. In North Carolina, you had a fine pastor, a fine man, and they got him on harvesting and they wanted to put them in jail. And now they want to make it all so that everybody can harvest because they know it's not a good thing. So people that don't want to vote are going to be sitting there, there'll be making them ... If you talk about 80 million ballots, it's 80 million, it could even be higher than that. I used to say 51 million, now it's 80 million. They said, \"Sir, you're a little obsolete with the 50.\" I said, \"All right, what is it?\" \"80.\" I said, \"80.\" How is it possible? Think of it, they'll be sending them, they'll be dumping them in neighborhoods. People are going to be picking them up. They'll be bribing. They'll be paying off people to grab some. This is going to be one of the greatest scams. And it's common sense. This has nothing to do with politics. It's common sense. Anybody, you don't have to know politics, they're going to mail out 80 million ballots. It's impossible. They have no idea. Who's mailing them? Mostly Democrat states and Democrat governors. Well, supposing they don't mail them to Republican neighborhoods. That means they're not going to get them. So they're going to complain and the election's going to be over. And then they're going to complain. And then they'll say, \"Oh, well, we didn't get it. Big deal.\" In the meantime, you might lose the election. This is the greatest scam in the history of politics, I think, and I'm talking about beyond our nation. And they act like they're aggrieved. Like by saying this, we're saying such a horrible thing. We're not patriotic by saying this. No, we voted during World War I. We voted at the voting booth during World War II. The pandemic, we're doing very well and people know how to handle it. Look at the crowds. They're doing very well. It's very safe. It's going to be very safe. If you have an absentee ballot where you request it, we're all in favor of that. Absentee, like in Florida, they have absentee is good. But other than that, they're very, very bad. There'll be millions of ballots. Take a look at New York, take a look at Virginia, take a look at New Jersey, all different cases. They just had one last night. Now they're thinking about recalling certain elections that took place with mail-in, and these are small elections that are locally based that are easy to run, not millions, but thousands of ballots, thousands, hundreds of ballots. But these are small, and they can't control it. They said 23% of the ballots were defective. What does defective mean? It means fraud. It means a lot of things that we won't get into because I don't want to be accused. You see all the cameras back there. It's the fake news. I don't want to be accused of anything. But what it means is they're trying to steal the election from the Republicans, that's what it means. In a very, very nice way, I will tell you they are trying to steal the election just like they did it last time with spying and we caught them, and that included President Obama and that included- Spygate. Let's be nice. Biden. This could only happen in North Carolina. But that included them and they got caught. And then somebody said, \"Well, what are you going to do?\" \" Well, we can attack a president.\" Oh, I see. If it was me ... They say we can't attack a president. We caught him. We caught him cold and they say, we can't attack. He was at meetings talking about it. And by the way, this was spying before and after. And I think it's a disgrace to our country. I think we can never let that happen again. But now they're doing something that in a certain way is more dangerous because it's more effective. They spied on my campaign, you know what they found, nothing. But this is big stuff. This is stealing millions of votes. And it's going to be very hard. Now we're in courts all over the country. And hopefully, we have judges that are going to give it a fair call because if they give it a fair call, we're going to win this election. The only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election. We're going to win this election. That's right. We're going to win this election. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. I'm just saying we cannot have these live, we call them live, some people call them universal, I like the word live, these live mail-in ballots sent to everybody, including mostly people that never asked for them. Think of it. You're sitting there, you get a ballot. Here's the bottom line. It was just given that in the polls believe it or not because the polls try and treat us right. That's why I respect Rasmussen because they did well. A few of the others feel the same way, and they did well last time. Those are the ones that I look at. The ones that did well last time and Rasmussen was very good. But if you look at it, every single vote that they have, every single vote it's going to be looked at. A man is sitting, or a woman is sitting, waiting for nothing, watching television, has no enthusiasm. Because on enthusiasm, the polls are saying that I'm up by massive numbers, not just a little. I'm also way up on the economy, by the way, put at the top. Way, way up. But I'm up by massive, and when I say I'm up, I'm talking about we're up. Okay. So if you could [inaudible 00:23:10]. We love you. But I'm up by massive numbers on enthusiasm. So our voters are saying, \"I'm very angry about this. I'll go to the poll directly and vote.\" But that vote is the saying, \"I don't care if Biden gets in.\" He doesn't have any enthusiasm. When you go to Ohio, when you go to Wisconsin, when you go to North Carolina, when you go to a lot of states, they have the Trump-Pence sign on every lawn. It's all over the place, right? It's all over. Indiana wants you. Indiana too. Indiana is great. Bobby Knight. We love Bobby Knight too. I'll tell you, we love Bobby Knight and Coach Oates and all of them. They love us. And we love them. Indiana is great. Thank you. But here's the thing. So if they don't have any enthusiasm, so you'd say, \"Are you going to vote?\" \"I'm not getting up to vote.\" Okay. \"I want to watch television instead of vote.\" All right. But here's a ballot. It just got to you. And he opens it. Oh, here's a ballet. What the hell am I going to do with this thing? And then they have somebody knocking on your door and they're harvesting. \"Hey, have you gotten your ballot?\" \"Yeah, I have my ballot.\" \"You going to sign it?\" \"Well, if you want, I'll sign it. Here it is. Get out of here.\" That's the most honest way of doing it, and that's unfair. That's unfair because now they're taking all of that enthusiasm that our party has, and we have tremendous enthusiasm. I think we have record enthusiasm. We have a base the likes of which nobody's seen, including these people. Wall Street Journal did a fantastic story this weekend, a fantastic cover story this weekend on the base. It's an incredible base. Everybody here is going to vote everybody in our base. I mean, we have a tremendous base. They don't. They have no enthusiasm for their candidate. Because frankly, Bernie Sanders, they have much more enthusiasm for him. But Bernie Sanders, excuse me, again, he's the greatest loser I've ever seen. This guy can lose and be so happy. Hillary Clinton, I want to use nice language so I don't want to a use certain word. It starts with the word S-C. I don't want to use it because they'll say he used foul language while in North Carolina. So I won't do that. But Bernie Sanders got taken advantage of, is that okay, by Hillary Clinton, but worse by the Democrats this time because of Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren got out of the campaign one day prior to the Super Tuesday vote, Bernie Sanders would have won every single state because Biden won by a little bit. She didn't do well, but she took thousands and thousands of votes away and he stayed. If you add just a percentage of those votes back, that means that Bernie would have won easily the nomination. And I'm glad he didn't because he had much more enthusiasm. And he would have had a base, a much smaller base than ours, but equally, I have to say this, equally as enthusiastic. This base doesn't like Joe Biden. They don't like Joe Biden. I think we're going to get a lot of votes. We did last time. People were surprised. Primarily because of trade because I know how other countries take advantage of us, and I understand that, and that's something that Bernie Sanders people really feel because I understand trade. I've done USMCA now. I got rid of NAFTA, the world's worst [inaudible 00:26:33]. Thank you, Mr. President. China tariffs. I mean, China had the worst year they've had in 67 years prior to the plague. The worst year they've had in decades and decades and we had the best year we've ever had. But we took in billions from China. We never took in 10 cents from China, never took in 10 cents. China for 25 years, and not only Obama, for 25 years China was taken in anywhere between 200 billion with a B and $550 billion from the United States. I give them all the credit, number one for being smart and outfoxing all of the people that stood here and their representatives, but China, we built China. We helped build. We gave them three, four, $500 billion a year because before that, and before the World Trade Organization and they getting into it, China was flat line. China was ... It was after that happened. And then they took advantage of us because we didn't have people that were smart enough to see. And by the way, Biden would be the worst of all of them because his son took out one and a half billion dollars and he gets fees on one and a half billion, which is millions of dollars a year. Give me a break. China will own our country if this guy gets elected. We can't let it happen. We can't let it happen. That's right. Stop that. Drain the swamp. So, we have a big one coming. ... So we have a big one coming. And just to finish, enthusiasm. So they take the enthusiasm now out of the equation, because they're going to go knock on everybody's door. Here, would you sign this? Yeah, I'll sign it. Nobody knows who the hell is signing it. And they now want to have it where the signature doesn't have to be verified. That's right. The signature doesn't have to be verified. And then they're going to play the game that we're not patriotic. What they're doing is using COVID to steal an election. They're using COVID to defraud the American people, all of our people, of a fair and free election. And we can't do that. And don't let them give you the Post Office stuff. The Postal Service, they do a great job. Lose a lot of money. I've said if they charged Amazon and these companies doing that, a couple of dollars more a package, that Amazon has to pay, not the customer. You know what happened? Post Office would start doing very well, thank you. Amazon dumps all the packages. Why should we deliver it? We'll let the Post Office do it and lose a fortune. So if they charged Amazon, now of course, he owns the Washington Post. So when I get bad stories in the Washington Post, I wonder why, right? I wonder why. But I just tell it like it is, right? I tell it like it is. We've accomplished more. We've accomplished more during the first three and a half years of this administration than any president in the history of our country. And I'm not even getting push back. I've been saying this for two years, for three years, I used to say for two years, for three years. But we've done more, let's say just about. This way they can't say, \"Well, somebody won a war, or something.\" Right? No, no. We've accomplished more than just about any administration in the history of our country. We've secured our borders. We've built our wall, which will be finished very shortly. We brought back manufacturing jobs. We've defeated the entire... Defeated the ISIS caliphate and killed al-Baghdadi. We also killed the greatest, biggest terrorist maybe of them all, Soleimani. We killed Soleimani, right? And al-Baghdadi. We appointed 300 new judges. By the end of the first term, we will have appointed 300. It's an unheard of number. That's because president Obama was very nice and he gave me 142 openings. And historically, you get no open. When you become president. First question, you say, \"How many judges?\" They'll say, \"None, sir.\" Because the other previous president, they want to... It's a very important thing, federal judges. We will have appointed 300, could be even more than that by the end of the first term. And I sat down, I said, first day, I said, \"How many judges do I get to appoint?\" They said, \"Sir, 142.\" I said, \"100...\" Because you know what? He thought that Hillary was going to win. Right? And the Republicans did not make it easy, let's say. But if you have enough time, there's not much anybody can do about it. We ended up with 142 judges. And now we've added many, many, and we're going to end up with 300 and two great Supreme Court justices. Yeah. Nice work, Mr. President. And remember this, I'm saying that I'm... I'm demanding actually, a list. Let Biden put up a list of the judges he's going to appoint. That he'll take them out, like I did. I had 25 and we're going to take it out of that list. And we're going to be announcing a list over the next couple of weeks with the judges that we had, plus we might add a few more. So you know exactly where we stand. He can't do it, because he would appoint... It's not him. He has no choice. The radical left will demand that he appoints super radical, left, wild, crazy justices. Going into the Supreme Court, your American dream will be dead if that happens. It'll be dead. And by the way, the next president... So I've had two. Some presidents have had none. I have had to in a relatively short period of time. But I will tell you that the next one could have two, three, four, and even five. The next president. This is so important. This is so... Whether you're talking about life, whether you're talking about second amendment, whether you're talking about military, this is so important. We have to do this. We have to win this election. But we brought back manufacturing. We rebuilt our military. We wiped out ISIS. I mean, think of it. When I came, ISIS was all over Iraq. The Prime Minister of Iraq was in last week and he said, \"I want to thank you for defeating ISIS.\" I said, \"Now, are you talking about me or the United States?\" \"You, because when you came into office, it was a mess. They were all over Iraq and Syria, and you defeated them, sir.\" I said, \"Good. Tell that to the media, please. Would you do that?\" And he said, \"I will.\" So let's say he does. But we passed the biggest tax cuts and regulations cuts in the history of our country. We replaced the worst trade deal ever made, NAFTA, with a great USMCA deal, that's going to keep our companies here and it's going to be treating us very nicely. And I wouldn't say the other two countries were thrilled with it, but they were happy enough. And we did that. And that's another thing, they said, \"You'll never be able to replace NAFTA. You'll never be able to get it.\" And I got it. We got it through Congress. We fixed a lot of our broken and bad trade deals. We're getting 40 billion now from Japan. We fixed a horrible deal that was made with South Korea. Remember, that was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \"This will produce 250,000 jobs.\" And she was right. Except unfortunately, the jobs went to South Korea, not to us. She said it would produce 250,000 jobs. And it did, to South Korea. And we stood up to China like nobody's ever stood up. Between the tariffs and the trade deal, which now... Don't forget, when I made that the ink wasn't dry before the China virus poured into our country, right? The ink wasn't dry. So I view that differently than I would have, because it's done very well. In the last week they had the largest order of corn, the largest order of soybeans. They are doing things... They're very smart. A lot of people, because they see my attitude. A lot of people would say, \"We're not going to order.\" They do just the opposite. I got a call last week, \"Sir...\" In fact, Sonny Purdue is here. The great Sonny Purdue, Secretary of Agriculture. There he is. Is that right, Sonny? I got a call. They ordered the largest, it was the largest order of corn in the history of our country. Twice. Twice. The largest order of corn. The largest order of soybeans. Here's how smart, somebody else would say, running some country. They'd say, \"Well, we're not going to do business with him. He's not saying nice things about...\" China's very smart. Instead, they order more corn than we've ever thought possible. Right, Sonny? Order more soybeans than we ever thought possible. And now I have farmers calling me up, \"Sir, we love China very much. Please don't be too tough on them.\" It makes it very difficult, Sonny, right? We do too good a job sometimes. We've achieved American energy independence. And we're now number one in the world, by far. And I saw where these phonies, you know they want to end everything we've done. They want to end it. They want to go to wind. They don't even know if they want to go to wind. I think they want to just basically close up our country, because they've taken away our strength, but they want to do something. But, there is no such thing. Solar can't do it. I love solar. It's all fine. Very, very heavily expensive. Very expensive. But they want to go to other forms of alternative energy. And I think that's okay, except we don't have them. And it's not going to power these massive factories. We need hydro! And hydro, I love. It's one of my all time favorites. Hydro, I love. I have to tell you. That's the Great Dams. You don't see that too much. You know why? The environmentalist say, \"You can't build a dam there.\" But now we can, because we've done- ... Yes we can! We've done things that nobody thought were possible. Like example, the Keystone pipeline. We got that approved. The Dakota Access pipeline. They were all bogged down, right? Right? We've got things that they said you couldn't get done. We're energy independence. And they said, \"We want to ban fracking.\" No fracking. How do you think they'll do in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota? Louisiana is going to love it. There's no fracking. There's basically... They want no fossil fuel whatsoever. Okay? No gas, no oil, no coal. No nothing. Okay. So they don't want anything. Now, they're getting killed. Because a poll just came out in Texas. Texas wasn't happy. They want no guns. They want no oil and gas. And they want no God. No God. It's no religion, no guns, no oil and gas. I don't think you're going to do too good in Texas. George Washington could come back from the dead and he could choose as his VP candidate, the late great Abraham Lincoln. And you're not going to win the state of Texas if you have no oil, no guns and no religion. I don't think so. Nice work! I don't think so. You're not going to win too many places. We eliminated Obamacare's horrible and very unfair individual mandate, which basically knocked out Obamacare. We knocked out Obamacare. We've protected your second amendment. So important. We're protected the second amendment. We've cut drug prices, first time in 51 years, we got drug prices down. Now, I'm really doing it. I did a favored nations clause. Meaning, we pay the same price as the lowest country that has the best deal. The companies are going crazy. The drug companies. They're taking ads on me. I said... I went to Mark Meadows. I said, \"Mark, they're killing me.\" They have nothing but cash. Okay? Big pharma, they call it for a reason. There's nobody that gives the politicians more money than big pharma. Nobody. Not even close. So I said, \"Well look, if you're not going to negotiate a fair deal, we're going to do a favored nations clause.\" To the top people, the biggest guys. They said, \"No, don't do that, favored nations.\" Favored nations, because you know, we have countries out there that are paying a tiny fraction of what our people are expected to pay. So if you have a country, Germany or others, they make... By the way, UK, all of Europe, Canada pays 50%, 5-0. 50% less. In fact, people leave our country, go to Canada, and pick up their drugs and they come back home. Can you believe that? This is the kind of difference. So I said, \"No, I want a favored nations clause. I also want a rebate clause.\" A rebate, where instead of the money going to the middleman, who have to be the richest people in the world. They get so much. They get more money, frankly, than the drug companies. At least the drug companies make a product. So I wiped out the rebate, where now it goes to people. And I instituted what's called a favored nations clause. And it's very simple. You have that in deals. It's whatever the lowest price in the world, we're the biggest purchaser of prescription drugs by far in the world. So whatever the lowest price is that other countries pay. So if you have a country paying 10 cents for a pill and we're paying $2.50 cents, and it's not such an exaggeration, believe me, then we get it for 10. So what happens is that doesn't work. So they'll go up a little bit. We'll come way, way down. So I said, \"Favored nations. I want to pay what the lowest price is anywhere in the world. We're the biggest purchaser, we want a favored nations.\" They had a heart attack. And then I signed it. They didn't believe it. And now what they're doing is they have ads, millions and millions of dollars worth of ads, that I've been horrible to the people because of drugs. And I believe in socialism. Socialism. You know why? Because some of the socialistic countries get the lowest price. So the only thing I have with socialism is I wanted to get their price. Okay. That's the only thing. Other than that is our country will never be a socialist country. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! So we cut drug crisis. And you could get cuts. You could get cuts. USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! You could get cuts as much as 50, 60 or 70%, maybe even more than that, on prescription drug prices. And wouldn't it be a kick... I'll use this, wouldn't it be a kick in the ass if I lost and sleepy Joe is president, and this thing kicks in right about soon, right? In 30, 40 days. And people wake up after the election. Boy, Biden's done a great job. My drug prices just went down by 70%. What a great- My drug prices just went down by 70%. What a great president he's been. He's great. And sleepy Joe would say, I thought about that, but everybody knew about favorite nations, but nobody had the guts to do it. And I'll tell you, I was called by many politicians, please don't do it, sir. Please. I said, \"why?\" They don't want to tell me why. I know why. Because they're politicians and they've been helped out and I guess we have to understand that too. But the fact is that we signed a favorite nations clause and a rebate clause, and your numbers are going to come down 60, 70%. And I hope you remember that on November 3rd, because nobody but me would ever do it. The other thing I've done aside from very strongly protecting your Second Amendment, which was not easy. That was not easy. And by the way, they will take your guns away as sure as you're standing or sitting there. They will take your guns away, either that or obliterate the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. You have the right to bear arms, especially when you look at a Portland and you see how weak those Democrats are. The governor, the mayor, how pathetic they let them riot every night. We're saying, let us come in and solve your problem. We will solve it for you in one hour just like we did in Minneapolis, Minnesota, right? Five nights, six nights, they have to ask us in. Let us come in. We'll solve your problem. They're almost used to it. This is the way our whole country would be if you ever let a thing like this happen, our whole country would be. So we protected your preexisting conditions, very strongly protected... and you don't hear that. But we very strongly protected your preexisting condition. So we got rid of the horrible individual mandate, which cost everybody a fortune and we strongly protected. Every Republican is sworn to protecting your pre existing conditions. It's very important. You won't hear that. You won't hear that from the fake news. We passed Right to Try. We passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. We mobilized the largest response since the Second World War. We are doing an incredible job on the China virus, but I'm going to talk to you about that Thursday night. Will anybody be listening on Thursday night? And just very quickly, in the second term among many other things, we'll continue with our military. We built the strongest military by far. It was depleted. A nice Marine back there. It was depleted like you wouldn't believe. We have the best jets and rockets and equipment of any kind, tanks. Tanks made in Ohio. Lima. Tanks made in Ohio. So we're going to create 10 million jobs, I think very easily, in the first 10 months. They want to raise your taxes. All my life I've heard as a politician, you like to lower taxes, right? This is the only election where somebody said we're going to raise your taxes. They're going to raise your taxes, quadruple your taxes. They're going to add on to the regulations. There all of these projects that we got started that are great projects, they won't be able to get built. So they're going to raise your taxes. They're going to raise your regulations, make it impossible to build a highway. It used to take 17 years, 18 years, 20 years, 21 years, long time in some cases, to get approval to build a highway, right? We have it down to two years now, we're going to have it down to one. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we're going to know it very quickly. We're not going to take 17 years. We could name highways. They took forever. End up costing a hundred times more and they're not as good. Some of them go in circles, I mean, to get to a point. They want to [inaudible 00:03:44]. Let's spend 37 million to... look, we've got to be smart. Got to be smart. We've got to win an election. Also, we're going to create tax credits for companies that bring our jobs back from China and other countries and impose tariffs on countries that take advantage of the United States. They've been taking advantage of us for years and years, and I've already done it in certain cases. We have countries that tariff us and we don't tariff them. So they tariff us. It's very simple. It's called reciprocal. They tariff us, we tariff them. We are going to fully fund law enforcement and hire more police. We're going to go with school choice and we've made a lot of progress on school choice for every student in America. We're going to continue to expand opportunities zones. There has been nothing better. Don't forget. It was us, us together that got criminal justice reform done. The greatest thing for the black community, African American community. They came and they said, \"We can't believe it. Obama didn't even try.\" And not only that, I got funded, the historically black colleges and universities. I got them funded. They weren't funded. They were year to year. They didn't know if they were going to be around for another year and they'd come in to the White House. And after three years, I said, \"Why do you guys keep coming back?\" Well, it's a year to your deal. I said, \"That's not fair. So you have to come back every year.\" And we got them longterm financing and longterm funding. Nobody's done more for the historically black colleges and universities than Donald Trump. Nobody. Nobody's done more for the African American community. No president has done as much as anybody since, I mean, since, and I say it, since Abraham Lincoln. It's true. It's true. Criminal justice reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott of South Carolina. He's a great senator, he's a great gentleman. Tim Scott is fantastic. Opportunities zones. But think of it, criminal justice reform, opportunity zones, the colleges and universities. What we've done has been amazing. But the most important thing is prior to the virus, the greatest job numbers in the history of the African American community, the Hispanic community and the Asian, as I said. So I just want to thank everybody. We're going to get rid of our sanctuary cities as soon as we can so that they don't protect. We put NASA back in action. NASA had grass growing through its runway. It had grass growing through the cracks of its runways. It was closed, essentially, just a disaster. Now it's the number one space center anywhere in the world by far. You saw the ships going up. And for some reason, a lot of rich people like rockets going up. And so we say, let's lease them our beautiful launching areas and let them send all the rockets, let them pay for it. But we'll be landing on Mars. We're going to the moon. We're go into Mars. We'll be the first on Mars. Let's see if that happens. We have to do it. If we hear it's going to happen. If somebody else is here, you're probably not. But I just want to, again, thank... I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. You're incredible warriors. You have incredible strength. You have unbelievable intelligence and patience. It's a combination of both. I don't know which is greater, the intelligence or the patience, but let's assume it's the intelligence. But I have to tell you, I think we have the greatest base of support anywhere at any time, any election and people are starting to find that out. They found it out in 2016. And I will be honest, this election, I believe we have far greater enthusiasm in this election. And we had a level that was a record because they still don't believe what happened. They said, \"Where are all these people coming from?\" Right? People that were great Americans that never voted, because they didn't like who they were watching or looking. People were great, they didn't vote. I'll never forget, a Congressman from Tennessee came up. They do very early voting. Tennessee, a great state. And they had just started voting. And I was in Pennsylvania making a speech. And he said, \"Sir, I don't know. I can't speak for anybody, but I'm from Tennessee and I've been doing this for a long time.\" He said, \"I've never seen anything like it. People are coming from the valleys and the hilltops. And they're coming from the cities. They're coming from all over. I never say, they're coming out of the rivers. They're coming along those beautiful war fields that we have. They're coming from everywhere, sir. I've never seen anything like it.\" But if other States are like Tennessee, you're going to win this election. He was the first one to say it. He was the first one. They came from the mountains. They came from everywhere. He said, \"I've never seen anything like it.\" And people they'd be having Trump pins and the hats. These are people that never were political people. They never wore a pin in their life having to do with politics. It's been an incredible experience for me. It's been an incredible experience, I think, for everyone. And I'll tell you what, next year is going to be an incredible... it's going to be a great, great year. It's going to be a year of tremendous success. We're fighting off this horrible thing that was delivered by China. And it was by China and we're never going to forget it and I let them know. We're never going to forget what they did because you know what? We're going to do great economics [inaudible 00:51:42] best year in the history of your state, but we're going to do better economically than we did last year. But we can never forget the 175,000 people, which will go up. Remember this though, we saved millions because if we didn't move and if I didn't put the ban on highly heavily infected people coming to our nation from China, that everybody told me not to do. Months later, they were saying we shouldn't... and then they all either apologized or admitted it was right. And Europe. I did Europe too, very early. If we didn't do that, our numbers would be at a level like you wouldn't believe. So, I just want to thank everybody for this incredible support. Be very, very careful. This is going to be, and I really believe this. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Don't let them take it away from you. Don't let them take it away. North Carolina, we love you. That's why I'm here. Thank you very much. Very special people. Thank you. God bless you all. Thank you.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1470276\/president-donald-trump-speaks-at-the-republican-national-convention&speechType=1","Summary":"Elections","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/www.rev.com\/transcript-editor\/shared\/wK7bosEa8Zy8a0aipxfU2Zs3rthA_WKczkgvxE-3FjSnHfoxzqR-PiYT8ooawPF3tLZg1wSslV_dMrt6PfYwJjir41I?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2709.77","CleanText":"Thank you very much. Thank you. Oklahoma loves you Mr. President. Thank you very much. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Now if you want to really drive them crazy, you say 12 more years. 12 more years. 12 more years. Because we caught them doing some really bad things in 2016. Let's see what happens. We caught them doing some really bad things. We have to be very careful because they're trying it again with this whole 80 million mail-in ballots that they're working on, sending them out to people that didn't ask for them, they didn't ask, they just get them and it's not fair and it's not right and it's not going to be possible to tabulate in my opinion. It's just my opinion. We have to be very, very careful, and you have to watch. Every one of you, you have to watch. Because bad things happened last time with the spying on our campaign and that goes to Biden and that goes to Obama and we have to be very, very careful. Have to be very, very careful, and this time they're trying to do it with the whole Post Office scam. They'll blame it on the Post Office. You can see them setting it up. Be very careful and watch it very carefully. Because we have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country. This is the most ... For a long period of time, I would say, 'Well 2016, how special was that evening? Was that one of the great ...' That was one of the great evenings but we have to be very, very careful and we have to win. Our country is counting on it. This is the biggest, this is it. Our country can go in a horrible, horrible direction or in an even greater direction and before the plague came in from China, that's where we were going. We were going in a direction like we had never seen. The most successful economy in the history of our country, the best unemployment numbers in history for African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, women, college students, bad students, good students, everybody. If you had a diploma, if you didn't have a diploma, didn't matter, you were doing well. Everybody was doing well and we were actually coming together. You know success brings people together, maybe better than anything else. Success brings people, so many times they say we're divided. Well we were very divided under President Obama, very divided. People have no idea how divided. They didn't talk about it as much, they didn't say it as much, but we were really coming together and I was speaking with Democrats all of a sudden because the success, the markets were at an all-time high and by the way, take a look at what's happening with the markets. Take a look at your 401(k)s which you probably do every hour. Take a look at your stocks. We're very close to breaking the record and NASDAQ has already done it. You know NASDAQ has broken the record I think 16 times already during a pandemic. Hopefully we'll call it the final phase of the pandemic. Biden the other day said no he'd shut it down. He'd listen to some guy say and he'd shut it down. We just broke a record on jobs, an all-time record. There's never been three months where we've put more people to work, over nine million people, and again, we're just about ready to break the all-time stock market record. I mean you look at it, we're just about ready to do it again and what that means is everything else is going to follow. Very small on Wall Street. Everything else is going to be there, the economy is coming up very rapidly, our farmers are doing well. Our farmers are doing well because I got China to give them $28 billion because they were targeted by China. I got the farmers $28 billion, 16 and 12. That's why. So in spite of the pandemic and our farmers did a great job in supplying food and all the difficulties during this period of time, but we're getting ready to do things like nobody has ever seen before, but the best way to bring unity is success. Success brings unity and we were there, and then we got hit with the plague but we won't forget that. I just want to thank the people of North Carolina because to be honest with you, I felt an obligation to be here. You have a governor is in a total shutdown mood. I guarantee you on November 4 it will all open up, it will be fine like most Southern states. On November 4, you know these Democrat governors, they love shutdown until after the election's over because they want to make our numbers look as bad as possible for the economy but our numbers are looking so good and frankly I used to say a V and people would say, 'Well maybe not. I don't think so.' Some would say no way. We have a super V, you're right. It's now looking like it's a super V. Our automobile numbers are incredible, both used cars and brand new cars, our manufacturing number is incredible. We're putting a lot of manufacturing jobs to work that the previous administration said you'd need a magic wand. You'd need a magic wand for manufacturing jobs, I don't think so. I guess we had the magic wand, that's all, but again, we're putting them back, we're bringing them back. But think of your life just prior to the plague coming in. It was the best it's ever been. Your state had the best numbers they've ever had, ever had, by far, and we had the best employment numbers also. We were up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere near that, and then we had to shut it down. We saved millions and millions of lives. We learned the enemy, we learned all about the invisible enemy, how it affects really people that are older, especially older people, the elderly, but older people with problems with heart and diabetes, with other problems, and we learned and most of the country is right now doing very, very well. They've done an incredible job and to have a man sitting on television the other day say, 'Oh I'd shut it down. Oh I'd shut it.' Like it's easy, shut it down. By the way, when you shut it down and we did the exact right thing, we shut it down, then we reopened and that's what we're doing now. We're well into it, but ... If we didn't shut it down at that point, we would have had millions of people dead. Millions of people. You see the numbers, the job that Mike Pence and the taskforce and all of us together have done has been incredible, what we've done, what we've achieved, whether it's ventilators, whether it's supplying equipment to governors that were totally ill-prepared. Many of the governors were totally ill-prepared. Nobody wants to say that but it's supposed to work that way, federalist, it's supposed to work that way. The governors are supposed to do it, and many of them did a fine job and many of them came back well. But most of them didn't have the equipment that they should have had. Few of them had the ventilators which are very, very complex machines and hard to make and hard to manufacture and expensive and we're right now making thousands of ventilators a month and we're sending them, we have all we can use, our whole country, every state. We're stocked, we're stocked and I always say and I'll say it again, there's never been a person that needed a ventilator that didn't get a ventilator. Every single person that's ever needed a ventilator, with all that you've heard with how much they said we didn't have again, I took over a country whose military was depleted and whose cupboard on this front were bare. The cupboards were bare. We didn't have anything. We didn't have a thing. We had very, very little and we did a great job. We haven't been given ... And it's not for me, it's for the incredible people, the generals, the admirals, the doctors, the nurses and yet you saw yesterday convalescent plasma, you saw remdesivir. You'll soon see vaccines pouring out years ahead of what they would have been under a more traditional, let's use that term because it's nicer, a more traditional administration where they would have taken years to come up with this stuff. We're coming up with it like nobody's ever seen before. The FDA, Dr. Hahn I want to thank him, Alex Azar, I want to thank him. They've come with things and done things that have never been done in terms of speed and frankly in terms of quality. If you look at it what we're doing and what we're coming up with, drug companies are coming up with vaccines that are ... I've seen some results already, it's going to be very, very soon. They're in Stage I trials. It's unheard of. We wouldn't be there for two years if this were a more normal situation. So I just want to thank everybody for being here and again I felt an obligation to come to North Carolina. It's been a place that's been very good to me. You know we won a lot of victories here. I haven't been doing this that long but I won every chance I had in North Carolina. I even stole a great chief of staff, Mark Meadows, right? I stole him from North Carolina, and he left Congress as a very popular guy. Could have been there for a long time if he wanted and he came in and by the way, you have a fantastic young gentleman going to take his place, he's a fantastic young guy and he's going to be a real star in the party. He's going to be a real star in the party. So I just want to thank everybody from North Carolina and I do want to show a little bit of a difference because another state that's been very good to me is Wisconsin and Joe Biden was going to have their convention in Milwaukee and they didn't go there at all, they didn't do this. We did this out of respect for your state. We didn't do this for any other reason other than respect for the state of North Carolina. Because we said we wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina and I think you're going to remember that frankly on November 3. We wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina. So I did that out of respect, and if you had a governor that would have let us have some people. He actually told me this, we had an arena that holds 19,000 people, it was totally jammed, sold out, every hotel was full, everything, and I called him, he said, 'But we have a shutdown going on and according to the rules and regulations ...' Now this is 19,000, he did say it. I don't think he'll deny it, but he said, 'According to the rules and regulations, the most people you're allowed to have in that room,' meaning that arena, he viewed it as a room, 'Is 10 people.' I say, 'So Governor, so I'm at 19,000, you're at 10. Can we work something in the middle.' It didn't sound too good, so we really had no choice. It was a terrible thing but I felt so badly because you could have ... I mean economic development money, all of the things that happen, but we decided, I was with Ronna, the vice president, everybody, Mark, and we said let's have our big deal, the roll call, let's have it right here and let's do it and I'm going to show up and I'm not going to tell anybody. Until a few minutes ago nobody knew I was coming. Nobody knew I was coming. But what's more important than the roll call? You're the ones calling it so what's more important - We love you Mr. President. We love you. I have to tell you, we're going to do a lot of things. I'm just going to go over very briefly because we're going to make a speech on Thursday night, I hope you're all going to be listening. Because I came in, I'm on Air Force One and Air Force One has more televisions that any plane in history. They've got them in closets, they've got them on ceilings, floors. They've got more ... You can't escape a television, and I turned to CNN and they didn't have this. They weren't having it, can you believe it? They didn't have it. No no, CNN didn't have our roll call. Then I turned to MSDNC as I call it. MSDNC which is truly, it is a branch of the Democrats. It's a I wouldn't say fully owned corporation but it's certainly a fully controlled or they control them, nobody really knows who's controlling who but they had it on television. I remember watching it, it was interesting. You see the difference states and we say this and we say that, the great state of Alaska, the great state of Alabama, the great state of North Carolina, the great state of all of them, and it's very interesting - ... Carolina. The great state of all of them. And it's very interesting to me. They had theirs on, but they didn't show it. Instead, they're showing the scam because they're trying to show the post office so that when their whole mail-in thing fizzles, they'll try blaming it on the post office. Okay. So they show in these hearings that are very boring actually and they're not showing you this either. They weren't showing this. And Fox had it on, but unfortunately, Fox wasn't showing it too much because they had the announcers talking, talking, talking. I said, ' I want to hear what they're saying, the delegates. I want to hear what they're saying.' So I think we had to switch over to CSPAN or to OAN or somebody. But I wanted to hear them. But I can promise you a few things. Number one, we will not be taking the word, God, out of The Pledge of Allegiance. Okay. Like they did a number of times at their caucuses, so they took the word God out. I heard it. I was listening and I said, 'That's strange.' It's sort of weird. You've heard it all your life, right? Under God, under God. All of a sudden, those two words are missing. I said, 'Oh, he must've made a mistake.' Maybe the teleprompter wasn't working or his book wasn't working that I have right here. Something wasn't working. I must admit. But the problem was then the next day I heard it again. And I said, 'That's not a mistake.' And then they immediately went into a mode, 'Oh, no, no, no, no. We didn't mean that. No, no. We didn't say if for the convention. We didn't say it.' No, that's where they're coming from. That's where they're coming from. You can say it or not say it. That is where they're coming from. Just like with energy, they don't want energy. Not working well in Texas, by the way. I just looked at a poll. And by the way, it just came out that we have received 51% in the big and very important Rasmussen poll, and my numbers actually went up during the Democratic National Convention, 51%. So, think of it. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Thank you. Four more years. I love this state. Four more years. Think of it- Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Thank you. Four more years. I love this state. I like this place and you're from all over the place. But this has been a good one for me. No, but think of it, so we're at 51% in Rasmussen. Do you read about it? Do you hear about it?. You don't hear about it. They give you these suppression polls, where they do registered voters instead of most likely. It's supposed to be likely, likely. In other words, how about you, you're likely to vote. But how about you, you're registered, but I'm not voting. But see, under their plan where they send these ballots, you don't have to want to vote. You get the ballot and then they have harvesting. They get guys to go, 'Do you want to vote?' 'No, not really, but I have a ballot.' 'All right, good. Who's it for?' 'Sleepy Joe Biden.' 'Now put it here, sign. Okay. Could I have it?' And they'll take it. In fact, harvesting is illegal in your state. They wanted to put a Republican, a fine man, a pastor, they wanted to put them in jail because he harvested. Now they want to make harvesting legal all of a sudden. They'll put him in jail as a Republican, right? If he was a Democrat, they wouldn't even be thinking about it. In California, they do the same thing. No repercussion. In North Carolina, you had a fine pastor, a fine man, and they got him on harvesting and they wanted to put them in jail. And now they want to make it all so that everybody can harvest because they know it's not a good thing. So people that don't want to vote are going to be sitting there, there'll be making them ... If you talk about 80 million ballots, it's 80 million, it could even be higher than that. I used to say 51 million, now it's 80 million. They said, 'Sir, you're a little obsolete with the 50.' I said, 'All right, what is it?' '80.' I said, '80.' How is it possible? Think of it, they'll be sending them, they'll be dumping them in neighborhoods. People are going to be picking them up. They'll be bribing. They'll be paying off people to grab some. This is going to be one of the greatest scams. And it's common sense. This has nothing to do with politics. It's common sense. Anybody, you don't have to know politics, they're going to mail out 80 million ballots. It's impossible. They have no idea. Who's mailing them? Mostly Democrat states and Democrat governors. Well, supposing they don't mail them to Republican neighborhoods. That means they're not going to get them. So they're going to complain and the election's going to be over. And then they're going to complain. And then they'll say, 'Oh, well, we didn't get it. Big deal.' In the meantime, you might lose the election. This is the greatest scam in the history of politics, I think, and I'm talking about beyond our nation. And they act like they're aggrieved. Like by saying this, we're saying such a horrible thing. We're not patriotic by saying this. No, we voted during World War I. We voted at the voting booth during World War II. The pandemic, we're doing very well and people know how to handle it. Look at the crowds. They're doing very well. It's very safe. It's going to be very safe. If you have an absentee ballot where you request it, we're all in favor of that. Absentee, like in Florida, they have absentee is good. But other than that, they're very, very bad. There'll be millions of ballots. Take a look at New York, take a look at Virginia, take a look at New Jersey, all different cases. They just had one last night. Now they're thinking about recalling certain elections that took place with mail-in, and these are small elections that are locally based that are easy to run, not millions, but thousands of ballots, thousands, hundreds of ballots. But these are small, and they can't control it. They said 23% of the ballots were defective. What does defective mean? It means fraud. It means a lot of things that we won't get into because I don't want to be accused. You see all the cameras back there. It's the fake news. I don't want to be accused of anything. But what it means is they're trying to steal the election from the Republicans, that's what it means. In a very, very nice way, I will tell you they are trying to steal the election just like they did it last time with spying and we caught them, and that included President Obama and that included- Spygate. Let's be nice. Biden. This could only happen in North Carolina. But that included them and they got caught. And then somebody said, 'Well, what are you going to do?' ' Well, we can attack a president.' Oh, I see. If it was me ... They say we can't attack a president. We caught him. We caught him cold and they say, we can't attack. He was at meetings talking about it. And by the way, this was spying before and after. And I think it's a disgrace to our country. I think we can never let that happen again. But now they're doing something that in a certain way is more dangerous because it's more effective. They spied on my campaign, you know what they found, nothing. But this is big stuff. This is stealing millions of votes. And it's going to be very hard. Now we're in courts all over the country. And hopefully, we have judges that are going to give it a fair call because if they give it a fair call, we're going to win this election. The only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election. We're going to win this election. That's right. We're going to win this election. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. I'm just saying we cannot have these live, we call them live, some people call them universal, I like the word live, these live mail-in ballots sent to everybody, including mostly people that never asked for them. Think of it. You're sitting there, you get a ballot. Here's the bottom line. It was just given that in the polls believe it or not because the polls try and treat us right. That's why I respect Rasmussen because they did well. A few of the others feel the same way, and they did well last time. Those are the ones that I look at. The ones that did well last time and Rasmussen was very good. But if you look at it, every single vote that they have, every single vote it's going to be looked at. A man is sitting, or a woman is sitting, waiting for nothing, watching television, has no enthusiasm. Because on enthusiasm, the polls are saying that I'm up by massive numbers, not just a little. I'm also way up on the economy, by the way, put at the top. Way, way up. But I'm up by massive, and when I say I'm up, I'm talking about we're up. Okay. So if you could . We love you. But I'm up by massive numbers on enthusiasm. So our voters are saying, 'I'm very angry about this. I'll go to the poll directly and vote.' But that vote is the saying, 'I don't care if Biden gets in.' He doesn't have any enthusiasm. When you go to Ohio, when you go to Wisconsin, when you go to North Carolina, when you go to a lot of states, they have the Trump-Pence sign on every lawn. It's all over the place, right? It's all over. Indiana wants you. Indiana too. Indiana is great. Bobby Knight. We love Bobby Knight too. I'll tell you, we love Bobby Knight and Coach Oates and all of them. They love us. And we love them. Indiana is great. Thank you. But here's the thing. So if they don't have any enthusiasm, so you'd say, 'Are you going to vote?' 'I'm not getting up to vote.' Okay. 'I want to watch television instead of vote.' All right. But here's a ballot. It just got to you. And he opens it. Oh, here's a ballet. What the hell am I going to do with this thing? And then they have somebody knocking on your door and they're harvesting. 'Hey, have you gotten your ballot?' 'Yeah, I have my ballot.' 'You going to sign it?' 'Well, if you want, I'll sign it. Here it is. Get out of here.' That's the most honest way of doing it, and that's unfair. That's unfair because now they're taking all of that enthusiasm that our party has, and we have tremendous enthusiasm. I think we have record enthusiasm. We have a base the likes of which nobody's seen, including these people. Wall Street Journal did a fantastic story this weekend, a fantastic cover story this weekend on the base. It's an incredible base. Everybody here is going to vote everybody in our base. I mean, we have a tremendous base. They don't. They have no enthusiasm for their candidate. Because frankly, Bernie Sanders, they have much more enthusiasm for him. But Bernie Sanders, excuse me, again, he's the greatest loser I've ever seen. This guy can lose and be so happy. Hillary Clinton, I want to use nice language so I don't want to a use certain word. It starts with the word S-C. I don't want to use it because they'll say he used foul language while in North Carolina. So I won't do that. But Bernie Sanders got taken advantage of, is that okay, by Hillary Clinton, but worse by the Democrats this time because of Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren got out of the campaign one day prior to the Super Tuesday vote, Bernie Sanders would have won every single state because Biden won by a little bit. She didn't do well, but she took thousands and thousands of votes away and he stayed. If you add just a percentage of those votes back, that means that Bernie would have won easily the nomination. And I'm glad he didn't because he had much more enthusiasm. And he would have had a base, a much smaller base than ours, but equally, I have to say this, equally as enthusiastic. This base doesn't like Joe Biden. They don't like Joe Biden. I think we're going to get a lot of votes. We did last time. People were surprised. Primarily because of trade because I know how other countries take advantage of us, and I understand that, and that's something that Bernie Sanders people really feel because I understand trade. I've done USMCA now. I got rid of NAFTA, the world's worst . Thank you, Mr. President. China tariffs. I mean, China had the worst year they've had in 67 years prior to the plague. The worst year they've had in decades and decades and we had the best year we've ever had. But we took in billions from China. We never took in 10 cents from China, never took in 10 cents. China for 25 years, and not only Obama, for 25 years China was taken in anywhere between 200 billion with a B and $550 billion from the United States. I give them all the credit, number one for being smart and outfoxing all of the people that stood here and their representatives, but China, we built China. We helped build. We gave them three, four, $500 billion a year because before that, and before the World Trade Organization and they getting into it, China was flat line. China was ... It was after that happened. And then they took advantage of us because we didn't have people that were smart enough to see. And by the way, Biden would be the worst of all of them because his son took out one and a half billion dollars and he gets fees on one and a half billion, which is millions of dollars a year. Give me a break. China will own our country if this guy gets elected. We can't let it happen. We can't let it happen. That's right. Stop that. Drain the swamp. So, we have a big one coming. ... So we have a big one coming. And just to finish, enthusiasm. So they take the enthusiasm now out of the equation, because they're going to go knock on everybody's door. Here, would you sign this? Yeah, I'll sign it. Nobody knows who the hell is signing it. And they now want to have it where the signature doesn't have to be verified. That's right. The signature doesn't have to be verified. And then they're going to play the game that we're not patriotic. What they're doing is using COVID to steal an election. They're using COVID to defraud the American people, all of our people, of a fair and free election. And we can't do that. And don't let them give you the Post Office stuff. The Postal Service, they do a great job. Lose a lot of money. I've said if they charged Amazon and these companies doing that, a couple of dollars more a package, that Amazon has to pay, not the customer. You know what happened? Post Office would start doing very well, thank you. Amazon dumps all the packages. Why should we deliver it? We'll let the Post Office do it and lose a fortune. So if they charged Amazon, now of course, he owns the Washington Post. So when I get bad stories in the Washington Post, I wonder why, right? I wonder why. But I just tell it like it is, right? I tell it like it is. We've accomplished more. We've accomplished more during the first three and a half years of this administration than any president in the history of our country. And I'm not even getting push back. I've been saying this for two years, for three years, I used to say for two years, for three years. But we've done more, let's say just about. This way they can't say, 'Well, somebody won a war, or something.' Right? No, no. We've accomplished more than just about any administration in the history of our country. We've secured our borders. We've built our wall, which will be finished very shortly. We brought back manufacturing jobs. We've defeated the entire... Defeated the ISIS caliphate and killed al-Baghdadi. We also killed the greatest, biggest terrorist maybe of them all, Soleimani. We killed Soleimani, right? And al-Baghdadi. We appointed 300 new judges. By the end of the first term, we will have appointed 300. It's an unheard of number. That's because president Obama was very nice and he gave me 142 openings. And historically, you get no open. When you become president. First question, you say, 'How many judges?' They'll say, 'None, sir.' Because the other previous president, they want to... It's a very important thing, federal judges. We will have appointed 300, could be even more than that by the end of the first term. And I sat down, I said, first day, I said, 'How many judges do I get to appoint?' They said, 'Sir, 142.' I said, '100...' Because you know what? He thought that Hillary was going to win. Right? And the Republicans did not make it easy, let's say. But if you have enough time, there's not much anybody can do about it. We ended up with 142 judges. And now we've added many, many, and we're going to end up with 300 and two great Supreme Court justices. Yeah. Nice work, Mr. President. And remember this, I'm saying that I'm... I'm demanding actually, a list. Let Biden put up a list of the judges he's going to appoint. That he'll take them out, like I did. I had 25 and we're going to take it out of that list. And we're going to be announcing a list over the next couple of weeks with the judges that we had, plus we might add a few more. So you know exactly where we stand. He can't do it, because he would appoint... It's not him. He has no choice. The radical left will demand that he appoints super radical, left, wild, crazy justices. Going into the Supreme Court, your American dream will be dead if that happens. It'll be dead. And by the way, the next president... So I've had two. Some presidents have had none. I have had to in a relatively short period of time. But I will tell you that the next one could have two, three, four, and even five. The next president. This is so important. This is so... Whether you're talking about life, whether you're talking about second amendment, whether you're talking about military, this is so important. We have to do this. We have to win this election. But we brought back manufacturing. We rebuilt our military. We wiped out ISIS. I mean, think of it. When I came, ISIS was all over Iraq. The Prime Minister of Iraq was in last week and he said, 'I want to thank you for defeating ISIS.' I said, 'Now, are you talking about me or the United States?' 'You, because when you came into office, it was a mess. They were all over Iraq and Syria, and you defeated them, sir.' I said, 'Good. Tell that to the media, please. Would you do that?' And he said, 'I will.' So let's say he does. But we passed the biggest tax cuts and regulations cuts in the history of our country. We replaced the worst trade deal ever made, NAFTA, with a great USMCA deal, that's going to keep our companies here and it's going to be treating us very nicely. And I wouldn't say the other two countries were thrilled with it, but they were happy enough. And we did that. And that's another thing, they said, 'You'll never be able to replace NAFTA. You'll never be able to get it.' And I got it. We got it through Congress. We fixed a lot of our broken and bad trade deals. We're getting 40 billion now from Japan. We fixed a horrible deal that was made with South Korea. Remember, that was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, 'This will produce 250,000 jobs.' And she was right. Except unfortunately, the jobs went to South Korea, not to us. She said it would produce 250,000 jobs. And it did, to South Korea. And we stood up to China like nobody's ever stood up. Between the tariffs and the trade deal, which now... Don't forget, when I made that the ink wasn't dry before the China virus poured into our country, right? The ink wasn't dry. So I view that differently than I would have, because it's done very well. In the last week they had the largest order of corn, the largest order of soybeans. They are doing things... They're very smart. A lot of people, because they see my attitude. A lot of people would say, 'We're not going to order.' They do just the opposite. I got a call last week, 'Sir...' In fact, Sonny Purdue is here. The great Sonny Purdue, Secretary of Agriculture. There he is. Is that right, Sonny? I got a call. They ordered the largest, it was the largest order of corn in the history of our country. Twice. Twice. The largest order of corn. The largest order of soybeans. Here's how smart, somebody else would say, running some country. They'd say, 'Well, we're not going to do business with him. He's not saying nice things about...' China's very smart. Instead, they order more corn than we've ever thought possible. Right, Sonny? Order more soybeans than we ever thought possible. And now I have farmers calling me up, 'Sir, we love China very much. Please don't be too tough on them.' It makes it very difficult, Sonny, right? We do too good a job sometimes. We've achieved American energy independence. And we're now number one in the world, by far. And I saw where these phonies, you know they want to end everything we've done. They want to end it. They want to go to wind. They don't even know if they want to go to wind. I think they want to just basically close up our country, because they've taken away our strength, but they want to do something. But, there is no such thing. Solar can't do it. I love solar. It's all fine. Very, very heavily expensive. Very expensive. But they want to go to other forms of alternative energy. And I think that's okay, except we don't have them. And it's not going to power these massive factories. We need hydro! And hydro, I love. It's one of my all time favorites. Hydro, I love. I have to tell you. That's the Great Dams. You don't see that too much. You know why? The environmentalist say, 'You can't build a dam there.' But now we can, because we've done- ... Yes we can! We've done things that nobody thought were possible. Like example, the Keystone pipeline. We got that approved. The Dakota Access pipeline. They were all bogged down, right? Right? We've got things that they said you couldn't get done. We're energy independence. And they said, 'We want to ban fracking.' No fracking. How do you think they'll do in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota? Louisiana is going to love it. There's no fracking. There's basically... They want no fossil fuel whatsoever. Okay? No gas, no oil, no coal. No nothing. Okay. So they don't want anything. Now, they're getting killed. Because a poll just came out in Texas. Texas wasn't happy. They want no guns. They want no oil and gas. And they want no God. No God. It's no religion, no guns, no oil and gas. I don't think you're going to do too good in Texas. George Washington could come back from the dead and he could choose as his VP candidate, the late great Abraham Lincoln. And you're not going to win the state of Texas if you have no oil, no guns and no religion. I don't think so. Nice work! I don't think so. You're not going to win too many places. We eliminated Obamacare's horrible and very unfair individual mandate, which basically knocked out Obamacare. We knocked out Obamacare. We've protected your second amendment. So important. We're protected the second amendment. We've cut drug prices, first time in 51 years, we got drug prices down. Now, I'm really doing it. I did a favored nations clause. Meaning, we pay the same price as the lowest country that has the best deal. The companies are going crazy. The drug companies. They're taking ads on me. I said... I went to Mark Meadows. I said, 'Mark, they're killing me.' They have nothing but cash. Okay? Big pharma, they call it for a reason. There's nobody that gives the politicians more money than big pharma. Nobody. Not even close. So I said, 'Well look, if you're not going to negotiate a fair deal, we're going to do a favored nations clause.' To the top people, the biggest guys. They said, 'No, don't do that, favored nations.' Favored nations, because you know, we have countries out there that are paying a tiny fraction of what our people are expected to pay. So if you have a country, Germany or others, they make... By the way, UK, all of Europe, Canada pays 50%, 5-0. 50% less. In fact, people leave our country, go to Canada, and pick up their drugs and they come back home. Can you believe that? This is the kind of difference. So I said, 'No, I want a favored nations clause. I also want a rebate clause.' A rebate, where instead of the money going to the middleman, who have to be the richest people in the world. They get so much. They get more money, frankly, than the drug companies. At least the drug companies make a product. So I wiped out the rebate, where now it goes to people. And I instituted what's called a favored nations clause. And it's very simple. You have that in deals. It's whatever the lowest price in the world, we're the biggest purchaser of prescription drugs by far in the world. So whatever the lowest price is that other countries pay. So if you have a country paying 10 cents for a pill and we're paying $2.50 cents, and it's not such an exaggeration, believe me, then we get it for 10. So what happens is that doesn't work. So they'll go up a little bit. We'll come way, way down. So I said, 'Favored nations. I want to pay what the lowest price is anywhere in the world. We're the biggest purchaser, we want a favored nations.' They had a heart attack. And then I signed it. They didn't believe it. And now what they're doing is they have ads, millions and millions of dollars worth of ads, that I've been horrible to the people because of drugs. And I believe in socialism. Socialism. You know why? Because some of the socialistic countries get the lowest price. So the only thing I have with socialism is I wanted to get their price. Okay. That's the only thing. Other than that is our country will never be a socialist country. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! So we cut drug crisis. And you could get cuts. You could get cuts. USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! You could get cuts as much as 50, 60 or 70%, maybe even more than that, on prescription drug prices. And wouldn't it be a kick... I'll use this, wouldn't it be a kick in the ass if I lost and sleepy Joe is president, and this thing kicks in right about soon, right? In 30, 40 days. And people wake up after the election. Boy, Biden's done a great job. My drug prices just went down by 70%. What a great- My drug prices just went down by 70%. What a great president he's been. He's great. And sleepy Joe would say, I thought about that, but everybody knew about favorite nations, but nobody had the guts to do it. And I'll tell you, I was called by many politicians, please don't do it, sir. Please. I said, 'why?' They don't want to tell me why. I know why. Because they're politicians and they've been helped out and I guess we have to understand that too. But the fact is that we signed a favorite nations clause and a rebate clause, and your numbers are going to come down 60, 70%. And I hope you remember that on November 3rd, because nobody but me would ever do it. The other thing I've done aside from very strongly protecting your Second Amendment, which was not easy. That was not easy. And by the way, they will take your guns away as sure as you're standing or sitting there. They will take your guns away, either that or obliterate the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. You have the right to bear arms, especially when you look at a Portland and you see how weak those Democrats are. The governor, the mayor, how pathetic they let them riot every night. We're saying, let us come in and solve your problem. We will solve it for you in one hour just like we did in Minneapolis, Minnesota, right? Five nights, six nights, they have to ask us in. Let us come in. We'll solve your problem. They're almost used to it. This is the way our whole country would be if you ever let a thing like this happen, our whole country would be. So we protected your preexisting conditions, very strongly protected... and you don't hear that. But we very strongly protected your preexisting condition. So we got rid of the horrible individual mandate, which cost everybody a fortune and we strongly protected. Every Republican is sworn to protecting your pre existing conditions. It's very important. You won't hear that. You won't hear that from the fake news. We passed Right to Try. We passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. We mobilized the largest response since the Second World War. We are doing an incredible job on the China virus, but I'm going to talk to you about that Thursday night. Will anybody be listening on Thursday night? And just very quickly, in the second term among many other things, we'll continue with our military. We built the strongest military by far. It was depleted. A nice Marine back there. It was depleted like you wouldn't believe. We have the best jets and rockets and equipment of any kind, tanks. Tanks made in Ohio. Lima. Tanks made in Ohio. So we're going to create 10 million jobs, I think very easily, in the first 10 months. They want to raise your taxes. All my life I've heard as a politician, you like to lower taxes, right? This is the only election where somebody said we're going to raise your taxes. They're going to raise your taxes, quadruple your taxes. They're going to add on to the regulations. There all of these projects that we got started that are great projects, they won't be able to get built. So they're going to raise your taxes. They're going to raise your regulations, make it impossible to build a highway. It used to take 17 years, 18 years, 20 years, 21 years, long time in some cases, to get approval to build a highway, right? We have it down to two years now, we're going to have it down to one. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we're going to know it very quickly. We're not going to take 17 years. We could name highways. They took forever. End up costing a hundred times more and they're not as good. Some of them go in circles, I mean, to get to a point. They want to . Let's spend 37 million to... look, we've got to be smart. Got to be smart. We've got to win an election. Also, we're going to create tax credits for companies that bring our jobs back from China and other countries and impose tariffs on countries that take advantage of the United States. They've been taking advantage of us for years and years, and I've already done it in certain cases. We have countries that tariff us and we don't tariff them. So they tariff us. It's very simple. It's called reciprocal. They tariff us, we tariff them. We are going to fully fund law enforcement and hire more police. We're going to go with school choice and we've made a lot of progress on school choice for every student in America. We're going to continue to expand opportunities zones. There has been nothing better. Don't forget. It was us, us together that got criminal justice reform done. The greatest thing for the black community, African American community. They came and they said, 'We can't believe it. Obama didn't even try.' And not only that, I got funded, the historically black colleges and universities. I got them funded. They weren't funded. They were year to year. They didn't know if they were going to be around for another year and they'd come in to the White House. And after three years, I said, 'Why do you guys keep coming back?' Well, it's a year to your deal. I said, 'That's not fair. So you have to come back every year.' And we got them longterm financing and longterm funding. Nobody's done more for the historically black colleges and universities than Donald Trump. Nobody. Nobody's done more for the African American community. No president has done as much as anybody since, I mean, since, and I say it, since Abraham Lincoln. It's true. It's true. Criminal justice reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott of South Carolina. He's a great senator, he's a great gentleman. Tim Scott is fantastic. Opportunities zones. But think of it, criminal justice reform, opportunity zones, the colleges and universities. What we've done has been amazing. But the most important thing is prior to the virus, the greatest job numbers in the history of the African American community, the Hispanic community and the Asian, as I said. So I just want to thank everybody. We're going to get rid of our sanctuary cities as soon as we can so that they don't protect. We put NASA back in action. NASA had grass growing through its runway. It had grass growing through the cracks of its runways. It was closed, essentially, just a disaster. Now it's the number one space center anywhere in the world by far. You saw the ships going up. And for some reason, a lot of rich people like rockets going up. And so we say, let's lease them our beautiful launching areas and let them send all the rockets, let them pay for it. But we'll be landing on Mars. We're going to the moon. We're go into Mars. We'll be the first on Mars. Let's see if that happens. We have to do it. If we hear it's going to happen. If somebody else is here, you're probably not. But I just want to, again, thank... I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. You're incredible warriors. You have incredible strength. You have unbelievable intelligence and patience. It's a combination of both. I don't know which is greater, the intelligence or the patience, but let's assume it's the intelligence. But I have to tell you, I think we have the greatest base of support anywhere at any time, any election and people are starting to find that out. They found it out in 2016. And I will be honest, this election, I believe we have far greater enthusiasm in this election. And we had a level that was a record because they still don't believe what happened. They said, 'Where are all these people coming from?' Right? People that were great Americans that never voted, because they didn't like who they were watching or looking. People were great, they didn't vote. I'll never forget, a Congressman from Tennessee came up. They do very early voting. Tennessee, a great state. And they had just started voting. And I was in Pennsylvania making a speech. And he said, 'Sir, I don't know. I can't speak for anybody, but I'm from Tennessee and I've been doing this for a long time.' He said, 'I've never seen anything like it. People are coming from the valleys and the hilltops. And they're coming from the cities. They're coming from all over. I never say, they're coming out of the rivers. They're coming along those beautiful war fields that we have. They're coming from everywhere, sir. I've never seen anything like it.' But if other States are like Tennessee, you're going to win this election. He was the first one to say it. He was the first one. They came from the mountains. They came from everywhere. He said, 'I've never seen anything like it.' And people they'd be having Trump pins and the hats. These are people that never were political people. They never wore a pin in their life having to do with politics. It's been an incredible experience for me. It's been an incredible experience, I think, for everyone. And I'll tell you what, next year is going to be an incredible... it's going to be a great, great year. It's going to be a year of tremendous success. We're fighting off this horrible thing that was delivered by China. And it was by China and we're never going to forget it and I let them know. We're never going to forget what they did because you know what? We're going to do great economics best year in the history of your state, but we're going to do better economically than we did last year. But we can never forget the 175,000 people, which will go up. Remember this though, we saved millions because if we didn't move and if I didn't put the ban on highly heavily infected people coming to our nation from China, that everybody told me not to do. Months later, they were saying we shouldn't... and then they all either apologized or admitted it was right. And Europe. I did Europe too, very early. If we didn't do that, our numbers would be at a level like you wouldn't believe. So, I just want to thank everybody for this incredible support. Be very, very careful. This is going to be, and I really believe this. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Don't let them take it away from you. Don't let them take it away. North Carolina, we love you. That's why I'm here. Thank you very much. Very special people. Thank you. God bless you all. Thank you."}
{"SpeechID":"VSDT2782020412","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-08-27","SpeechTitle":"President Trump's Republican Nomination Acceptance Remarks","Type":"speech","RawText":"As Prepared for Delivery Friends, delegates, and distinguished guests: I stand before you tonight honored by your support; proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four years; and brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the NEXT four years! As we begin this evening, our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura. We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi, sparing no effort to save lives. While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago. This is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement, and the individual states. I will be going this weekend. We are one national family, and we will always protect, love and care for each other. Here tonight are the people who have made my journey possible, and filled my life with so much joy. For her incredible service to our nation and its children, I want to thank our magnificent First Lady. I also want to thank my amazing daughter Ivanka for that introduction, and to all of my children and grandchildren , I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from Heaven. He was a great brother and was very proud of the job we are doing. Let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side, and stood up for our values , a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction: Vice President Mike Pence. Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence. My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States. The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined, and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, Independents, and anyone who believes in the GREATNESS of America and the righteous heart of the American People. In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history , quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and RECORD prosperity! We will DEFEND AMERICA against all threats, and protect America against all dangers. We will LEAD AMERICA into new frontiers of ambition and discovery, and we will reach for new heights of national achievement. We will rekindle new faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can ONLY be realized through love for our country. Because we understand that America is NOT a land cloaked in darkness, America is the torch that enlightens the entire world. Gathered here at our beautiful and majestic White House , known all over the world as the People's House , we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our Great American Story. This has been the home of larger-than-life figures like Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future. Within these walls lived tenacious generals like Presidents Grant and Eisenhower who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and uncharted continent. In the depths of a bloody Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument , and asked God, in His Providence, to save our union. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt welcomed Winston Churchill, and just inside, they set our people on a course to victory in the Second World War. In recent months, our nation, and the entire planet, has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. We are delivering lifesaving therapies, and will produce a vaccine BEFORE the end of the year, or maybe even sooner! We will defeat THE VIRUS, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before. What united generations past was an unshakable confidence in America's destiny, and an unbreakable faith in the American People. They knew that our country is blessed by God, and has a special purpose in this world. It is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the space program, and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny and communism. This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge, and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor. And yet, despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now endangered. This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas. This election will decide whether we SAVE the American Dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to DEMOLISH our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades. Your vote will decide whether we protect law abiding Americans, or whether we give free reign to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens. And this election will decide whether we will defend the American Way of Life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it. At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country? In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for YOU can only come from giving power to THEM. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history. But in this country, we don't look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we don't turn to government to restore our souls , we put our faith in Almighty God. Joe Biden is not the savior of America's soul , he is the destroyer of America's Jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American Greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain , and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars. Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were far behind in their defense payments. But at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year. This will ultimately go to $400 billion. Secretary General Stoltenberg, who heads NATO, was amazed, and said that President Trump did what no one else was able to do. From the moment I left my former life behind, and a good life it was, I have done nothing but fight for YOU. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington Politics. I KEPT MY PROMISES. Together, we have ended the rule of the failed political class , and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. They are angry at me because instead of putting THEM FIRST, I put AMERICA FIRST! Days after taking office, we shocked the Washington Establishment and withdrew from the last Administration's job-killing Trans Pacific Partnership. I then approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines, ended the unfair and costly Paris Climate Accord, and secured, for the first time, American Energy Independence. We passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts, at a rate nobody had ever seen before. Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world. Washington insiders asked me NOT to stand up to China , they pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American People. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest hitting action against China in American History. They said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace NAFTA , but again, they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement into law. Now auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees and deserting us. In perhaps no area did the Washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-American immigration. But I refused to back down , and today America's borders are more secure than EVER before. We ENDED catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20,000 Gang Members and 500,000 Criminal Aliens. We have already built 300 miles of Border Wall , and we are adding 10 new miles every single week. The Wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations. We are joined this evening by members of the Border Patrol union, representing our country's courageous border agents. Thank you all. When I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American Workers and forced them to train their lower-paid foreign replacements, I promptly removed the Chairman of the Board. And now, those talented American Workers have been RE-HIRED and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia. They have their old jobs back, and some are here with us this evening. Please stand. Last month, I took on Big Pharma and signed orders that will massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs, and to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed the decades long-awaited RIGHT TO TRY legislation. We also passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. By the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great new Supreme Court Justices. To bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, the long-term funding of historically black colleges and universities, and, before the China Virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans ever recorded. I have done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president. I have done more in three years for the black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years, and when I'm reelected, the best is yet to come! When I took office, the Middle East was in total chaos. ISIS was rampaging, Iran was on the rise, and the war in Afghanistan had no end in sight. I withdrew from the terrible, one-sided Iran Nuclear Deal. Unlike many presidents before me, I kept my promise, recognized Israel's true capital and moved our Embassy to Jerusalem. But not only did we talk about it as a future site, we got it built. Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already owned existing building in a better location, and opened it at a cost of less than $500,000. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years. In addition, we obliterated 100 percent of the ISIS Caliphate, and killed its founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Then, in a separate operation, we eliminated the world's number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. Unlike previous administrations, I have kept America OUT of new wars , and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2.5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office. This includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors. We also launched the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States military since the Air Force was created almost 75 years ago. We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs. The laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other states didn't want Joe Biden's hollow words of empathy, they wanted their jobs back! As Vice President, he supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the U.S. Auto Industry; he backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted FOR the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as \"a positive development\" for America and the world. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win. China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused. In recent months, our nation, and the rest of the world, has been hit with a once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders , please stand and accept our profound thanks. Many Americans have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives so tragically taken. In their honor, we will unite. In their memory, we will overcome. When the China Virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Invoking the Defense Production Act, we produced the world's largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves and gowns to our front line healthcare workers. To protect our nation's seniors, we rushed supplies, testing kits, and personnel to nursing homes and long term care facilities. The Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals, and the Navy deployed our great hospital ships. We developed, from scratch, the largest and most advanced testing system in the world. America has tested more than every country in Europe put together, and more than every nation in the Western Hemisphere COMBINED. We have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation. We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful anti-body treatment known as Convalescent Plasma that will save thousands of lives. Thanks to advances we have pioneered, the fatality rate has been reduced by 80 percent since April. The United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. The European Union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30 percent greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. We enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our Paycheck Protection Program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation, and we are recovering much faster. Over the past three months, we have gained over 9 million jobs, a new record. Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize. When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. Instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation's children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds. The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation and more. Joe Biden's plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather a surrender. My Administration has a different approach. To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk , especially the elderly , while allowing lower-risk Americans to safely return to work and school. Most importantly, we are marshalling America's scientific genius to produce a vaccine in RECORD TIME. Under Operation Warp Speed, we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now, years ahead of what has been achieved before. We are producing them in advance, so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available. We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year, and together we will crush the virus. At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda. But that's not because they don't have one. It's because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee. Joe Biden may claim he is an \"ally of the Light,\" but when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep you completely in the dark. He has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy and once again record stock markets. On the other hand, just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hardworking moms and dads, not raise them. We will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China BACK to America , and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. We'll make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country, as I've already been doing. Joe Biden's agenda is Made in China. My agenda is MADE IN THE USA. Biden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas , laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico. Millions of jobs will be lost, and energy prices will soar. These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week. How can Joe Biden claim to be an \"ally of the Light\" when his own party can't even keep the lights on? Joe Biden's campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform co-authored with Far-Left Senator Bernie Sanders. The Biden-Bernie Manifesto calls for suspending ALL removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide Catch-and-Release; and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer-funded lawyers. Joe Biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage and promised to give away YOUR healthcare dollars to illegal immigrants. He also supports deadly Sanctuary Cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. The Biden Plan would eliminate America's borders in the middle of a global pandemic. Biden also vowed to oppose School Choice and close down Charter Schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for Black and Hispanic children. In a second term, I will EXPAND charter schools and provide SCHOOL CHOICE to every family in America. And we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect they deserve. Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable , yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up to the moment of BIRTH. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby's beating heart in the 9th month of pregnancy. Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America's soul? Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO LIFE. During the Democrat Convention, the words \"Under God\" were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance , not once, but twice. The fact is, this is where they are coming from. If the left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other Constitutional freedoms. Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn't have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, then how is he ever going to stand up FOR you? The most dangerous aspect of the Biden Platform is the attack on public safety. The Biden-Bernie Manifesto calls for Abolishing cash bail, immediately releasing 400,000 criminals onto your streets and into your neighborhoods. When asked if he supports cutting police funding, Joe Biden replied, \"Yes, absolutely.\" When Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called the Minneapolis police department a cancer that is \"rotten to the root,\" Biden wouldn't disavow her support and reject her endorsement , he proudly displayed it on his website. Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will Defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden's America. My administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. Every day, police officers risk their lives to keep us safe, and every year, many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty. One of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia. She was part of a team of American Heroes called the NYPD or New York's Finest. Three years ago on Fourth of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge. Detective Familia was a single mom , she'd recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids. Two years ago, I stood in front of the U.S. Capitol alongside those children, and held their Grandmother's hand as they mourned their terrible loss and we honored Detective Familia's extraordinary life. Detective Familia's three children are with us this evening. Genesis, Peter, and Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. I promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever. We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country are noble, courageous and honorable. We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. They are afraid to act. They are afraid to lose their pension. They are afraid to lose their jobs, and by being afraid they are not able to do their jobs. And those who suffer most are the great people who they want so desperately to protect. When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But what we can never have in America , and must never allow , is MOB RULE. In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York. There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to. We must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted, and punished to the fullest extent of the law. When the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments, I signed an order, ten years in prison, and it all stopped. During their convention, Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-Run Cities. In the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago, and other cities, Joe Biden's campaign did not condemn it , they DONATED to it. At least 13 members of Joe Biden's campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals, arsonists, looters, and rioters from jail. Here tonight is the grieving family of retired police Captain David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters. We are honored to be joined tonight by his wife Ann and beloved family members: Brian and Kielen. To each of you: we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn. As long as I am President, I will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity, and peace. If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag-burners, that is up to them, but I, as your President, will not be a part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America Safe. Last year, over 1,000 African-Americans were murdered as result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats, and have been for decades. Thousands more African-Americans are victims of violent crime in these communities Joe Biden and the left ignore these American Victims. I NEVER WILL. If the Radical Left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every city, town, and suburb in America. Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the U.S. Government. Liberal politicians claim to be concerned about the strength of American institutions. But who, exactly, is attacking them? Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement, and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by the radical left. Always Remember: they are coming after ME, because I am fighting for YOU. We must reclaim our independence from the left's repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases, and the ever-more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be FALSE, and scare you out of saying what you know to be TRUE. But on November 3rd, you can send them a thundering message they will never forget! Joe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage. These same liberals want to eliminate school choice, while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land. They want to open our borders while living in walled-off compounds and communities. They want to defund the police, while they have armed guards for themselves. This November, we must turn the page FOREVER on this failed political class. The fact is, I'm here, and they're not , and that's because of YOU. Together, we will write the next chapter of the Great American Story. Over the next four years, we will make America into the Manufacturing Superpower of the World. We will expand Opportunity Zones, bring home our medical supply chains, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before. We will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months. We will hire MORE police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities. We will BAN deadly Sanctuary Cities, and ensure that federal healthcare is protected for American Citizens , not illegal aliens. We will have strong borders, strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America OUT of endless and costly foreign wars. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the LAW , not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. We will uphold your religious liberty, and defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. We will protect Medicare and Social Security. We will always, and very strongly, protect patients with pre-existing conditions, and that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party. We will END surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums. We will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain number one in the world, and keep America Energy Independent. We will win the race to 5G, and build the world's best cyber and missile defense. We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools, and always protect free speech on college campuses. We will launch a new age of American Ambition in Space. America will land the first WOMAN on the moon , and the United States will be the first nation to plant its flag on Mars. This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country TOGETHER. So tonight, I say again to all Americans: This is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties, or two individuals, in ideology, philosophy, or vision than there is right now. Our opponents believe that America is a depraved nation. We want our sons and daughters to know the truth: America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world! Our country wasn't built by cancel culture, speech codes, and soul-crushing conformity. We are NOT a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American Patriots. We are a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers and trailblazers who refused to be tied down, held back, or reined in. Americans have steel in their spines, grit in their souls, and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on earth. I want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background, in America, ANYONE CAN RISE. With hard work, devotion, and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition. Our American Ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn till dusk. These pioneers didn't have money, they didn't have fame, but they had each other. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God! When opportunity beckoned, they picked up their Bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into covered wagons, and set out West for the next adventure. Ranchers and miners, cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers , they pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the Wild Frontier. Legends were born , Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crockett, and Buffalo Bill. Americans built their beautiful homesteads on the Open Range. Soon they had churches and communities, then towns, and with time, great centers of industry and commerce. That is who they were. Americans build the future, we don't tear down the past! We are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the skyscrapers, revolutionized industry, and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature , and we did it all with style, confidence and flair. Because THAT is who we are. Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call. From Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima, American Patriots raced into cannon blasts, bullets and bayonets to rescue American Liberty. But America didn't stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a 6 million pound rocket, and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so that two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous American flag planted on the face of the Moon. For America, nothing is impossible. Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights. And we will show the world that, for America, no dream is beyond our reach. Together, we are unstoppable. Together, we are unbeatable. Because together, we are the proud CITIZENS of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. And on November 3rd, we will make America safer, we will make America stronger, we will make America prouder, and we will make America GREATER than ever before! Thank you, God Bless You. God Bless America , GOODNIGHT!","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1462538\/president-trumps-republican-nomination-acceptance-remarks&speechType=1","Summary":"National Security Health and Health Care Environment Immigration Elections","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/www.donaldjtrump.com\/media\/president-trumps-republican-nomination-acceptance-remarks\/","CleanText":"As Prepared for Delivery Friends, delegates, and distinguished guests: I stand before you tonight honored by your support; proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four years; and brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the NEXT four years! As we begin this evening, our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura. We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi, sparing no effort to save lives. While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago. This is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement, and the individual states. I will be going this weekend. We are one national family, and we will always protect, love and care for each other. Here tonight are the people who have made my journey possible, and filled my life with so much joy. For her incredible service to our nation and its children, I want to thank our magnificent First Lady. I also want to thank my amazing daughter Ivanka for that introduction, and to all of my children and grandchildren , I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from Heaven. He was a great brother and was very proud of the job we are doing. Let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side, and stood up for our values , a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction: Vice President Mike Pence. Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence. My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States. The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined, and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, Independents, and anyone who believes in the GREATNESS of America and the righteous heart of the American People. In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history , quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and RECORD prosperity! We will DEFEND AMERICA against all threats, and protect America against all dangers. We will LEAD AMERICA into new frontiers of ambition and discovery, and we will reach for new heights of national achievement. We will rekindle new faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can ONLY be realized through love for our country. Because we understand that America is NOT a land cloaked in darkness, America is the torch that enlightens the entire world. Gathered here at our beautiful and majestic White House , known all over the world as the People's House , we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our Great American Story. This has been the home of larger-than-life figures like Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future. Within these walls lived tenacious generals like Presidents Grant and Eisenhower who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and uncharted continent. In the depths of a bloody Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument , and asked God, in His Providence, to save our union. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt welcomed Winston Churchill, and just inside, they set our people on a course to victory in the Second World War. In recent months, our nation, and the entire planet, has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. We are delivering lifesaving therapies, and will produce a vaccine BEFORE the end of the year, or maybe even sooner! We will defeat THE VIRUS, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before. What united generations past was an unshakable confidence in America's destiny, and an unbreakable faith in the American People. They knew that our country is blessed by God, and has a special purpose in this world. It is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the space program, and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny and communism. This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge, and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor. And yet, despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now endangered. This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas. This election will decide whether we SAVE the American Dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to DEMOLISH our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades. Your vote will decide whether we protect law abiding Americans, or whether we give free reign to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens. And this election will decide whether we will defend the American Way of Life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it. At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country? In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for YOU can only come from giving power to THEM. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history. But in this country, we don't look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we don't turn to government to restore our souls , we put our faith in Almighty God. Joe Biden is not the savior of America's soul , he is the destroyer of America's Jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American Greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain , and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars. Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were far behind in their defense payments. But at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year. This will ultimately go to $400 billion. Secretary General Stoltenberg, who heads NATO, was amazed, and said that President Trump did what no one else was able to do. From the moment I left my former life behind, and a good life it was, I have done nothing but fight for YOU. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington Politics. I KEPT MY PROMISES. Together, we have ended the rule of the failed political class , and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. They are angry at me because instead of putting THEM FIRST, I put AMERICA FIRST! Days after taking office, we shocked the Washington Establishment and withdrew from the last Administration's job-killing Trans Pacific Partnership. I then approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines, ended the unfair and costly Paris Climate Accord, and secured, for the first time, American Energy Independence. We passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts, at a rate nobody had ever seen before. Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world. Washington insiders asked me NOT to stand up to China , they pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American People. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest hitting action against China in American History. They said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace NAFTA , but again, they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement into law. Now auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees and deserting us. In perhaps no area did the Washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-American immigration. But I refused to back down , and today America's borders are more secure than EVER before. We ENDED catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20,000 Gang Members and 500,000 Criminal Aliens. We have already built 300 miles of Border Wall , and we are adding 10 new miles every single week. The Wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations. We are joined this evening by members of the Border Patrol union, representing our country's courageous border agents. Thank you all. When I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American Workers and forced them to train their lower-paid foreign replacements, I promptly removed the Chairman of the Board. And now, those talented American Workers have been RE-HIRED and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia. They have their old jobs back, and some are here with us this evening. Please stand. Last month, I took on Big Pharma and signed orders that will massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs, and to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed the decades long-awaited RIGHT TO TRY legislation. We also passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. By the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great new Supreme Court Justices. To bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, the long-term funding of historically black colleges and universities, and, before the China Virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans ever recorded. I have done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president. I have done more in three years for the black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years, and when I'm reelected, the best is yet to come! When I took office, the Middle East was in total chaos. ISIS was rampaging, Iran was on the rise, and the war in Afghanistan had no end in sight. I withdrew from the terrible, one-sided Iran Nuclear Deal. Unlike many presidents before me, I kept my promise, recognized Israel's true capital and moved our Embassy to Jerusalem. But not only did we talk about it as a future site, we got it built. Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already owned existing building in a better location, and opened it at a cost of less than $500,000. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years. In addition, we obliterated 100 percent of the ISIS Caliphate, and killed its founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Then, in a separate operation, we eliminated the world's number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. Unlike previous administrations, I have kept America OUT of new wars , and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2.5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office. This includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors. We also launched the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States military since the Air Force was created almost 75 years ago. We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs. The laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other states didn't want Joe Biden's hollow words of empathy, they wanted their jobs back! As Vice President, he supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the U.S. Auto Industry; he backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted FOR the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as 'a positive development' for America and the world. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win. China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused. In recent months, our nation, and the rest of the world, has been hit with a once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders , please stand and accept our profound thanks. Many Americans have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives so tragically taken. In their honor, we will unite. In their memory, we will overcome. When the China Virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Invoking the Defense Production Act, we produced the world's largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves and gowns to our front line healthcare workers. To protect our nation's seniors, we rushed supplies, testing kits, and personnel to nursing homes and long term care facilities. The Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals, and the Navy deployed our great hospital ships. We developed, from scratch, the largest and most advanced testing system in the world. America has tested more than every country in Europe put together, and more than every nation in the Western Hemisphere COMBINED. We have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation. We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful anti-body treatment known as Convalescent Plasma that will save thousands of lives. Thanks to advances we have pioneered, the fatality rate has been reduced by 80 percent since April. The United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. The European Union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30 percent greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. We enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our Paycheck Protection Program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation, and we are recovering much faster. Over the past three months, we have gained over 9 million jobs, a new record. Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize. When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. Instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation's children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds. The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation and more. Joe Biden's plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather a surrender. My Administration has a different approach. To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk , especially the elderly , while allowing lower-risk Americans to safely return to work and school. Most importantly, we are marshalling America's scientific genius to produce a vaccine in RECORD TIME. Under Operation Warp Speed, we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now, years ahead of what has been achieved before. We are producing them in advance, so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available. We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year, and together we will crush the virus. At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda. But that's not because they don't have one. It's because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee. Joe Biden may claim he is an 'ally of the Light,' but when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep you completely in the dark. He has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy and once again record stock markets. On the other hand, just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hardworking moms and dads, not raise them. We will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China BACK to America , and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. We'll make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country, as I've already been doing. Joe Biden's agenda is Made in China. My agenda is MADE IN THE USA. Biden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas , laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico. Millions of jobs will be lost, and energy prices will soar. These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week. How can Joe Biden claim to be an 'ally of the Light' when his own party can't even keep the lights on? Joe Biden's campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform co-authored with Far-Left Senator Bernie Sanders. The Biden-Bernie Manifesto calls for suspending ALL removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide Catch-and-Release; and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer-funded lawyers. Joe Biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage and promised to give away YOUR healthcare dollars to illegal immigrants. He also supports deadly Sanctuary Cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. The Biden Plan would eliminate America's borders in the middle of a global pandemic. Biden also vowed to oppose School Choice and close down Charter Schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for Black and Hispanic children. In a second term, I will EXPAND charter schools and provide SCHOOL CHOICE to every family in America. And we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect they deserve. Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable , yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up to the moment of BIRTH. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby's beating heart in the 9th month of pregnancy. Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America's soul? Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO LIFE. During the Democrat Convention, the words 'Under God' were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance , not once, but twice. The fact is, this is where they are coming from. If the left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other Constitutional freedoms. Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn't have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, then how is he ever going to stand up FOR you? The most dangerous aspect of the Biden Platform is the attack on public safety. The Biden-Bernie Manifesto calls for Abolishing cash bail, immediately releasing 400,000 criminals onto your streets and into your neighborhoods. When asked if he supports cutting police funding, Joe Biden replied, 'Yes, absolutely.' When Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called the Minneapolis police department a cancer that is 'rotten to the root,' Biden wouldn't disavow her support and reject her endorsement , he proudly displayed it on his website. Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will Defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden's America. My administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. Every day, police officers risk their lives to keep us safe, and every year, many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty. One of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia. She was part of a team of American Heroes called the NYPD or New York's Finest. Three years ago on Fourth of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge. Detective Familia was a single mom , she'd recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids. Two years ago, I stood in front of the U.S. Capitol alongside those children, and held their Grandmother's hand as they mourned their terrible loss and we honored Detective Familia's extraordinary life. Detective Familia's three children are with us this evening. Genesis, Peter, and Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. I promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever. We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country are noble, courageous and honorable. We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. They are afraid to act. They are afraid to lose their pension. They are afraid to lose their jobs, and by being afraid they are not able to do their jobs. And those who suffer most are the great people who they want so desperately to protect. When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But what we can never have in America , and must never allow , is MOB RULE. In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York. There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to. We must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted, and punished to the fullest extent of the law. When the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments, I signed an order, ten years in prison, and it all stopped. During their convention, Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-Run Cities. In the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago, and other cities, Joe Biden's campaign did not condemn it , they DONATED to it. At least 13 members of Joe Biden's campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals, arsonists, looters, and rioters from jail. Here tonight is the grieving family of retired police Captain David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters. We are honored to be joined tonight by his wife Ann and beloved family members: Brian and Kielen. To each of you: we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn. As long as I am President, I will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity, and peace. If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag-burners, that is up to them, but I, as your President, will not be a part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America Safe. Last year, over 1,000 African-Americans were murdered as result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats, and have been for decades. Thousands more African-Americans are victims of violent crime in these communities Joe Biden and the left ignore these American Victims. I NEVER WILL. If the Radical Left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every city, town, and suburb in America. Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the U.S. Government. Liberal politicians claim to be concerned about the strength of American institutions. But who, exactly, is attacking them? Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement, and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by the radical left. Always Remember: they are coming after ME, because I am fighting for YOU. We must reclaim our independence from the left's repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases, and the ever-more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be FALSE, and scare you out of saying what you know to be TRUE. But on November 3rd, you can send them a thundering message they will never forget! Joe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage. These same liberals want to eliminate school choice, while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land. They want to open our borders while living in walled-off compounds and communities. They want to defund the police, while they have armed guards for themselves. This November, we must turn the page FOREVER on this failed political class. The fact is, I'm here, and they're not , and that's because of YOU. Together, we will write the next chapter of the Great American Story. Over the next four years, we will make America into the Manufacturing Superpower of the World. We will expand Opportunity Zones, bring home our medical supply chains, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before. We will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months. We will hire MORE police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities. We will BAN deadly Sanctuary Cities, and ensure that federal healthcare is protected for American Citizens , not illegal aliens. We will have strong borders, strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America OUT of endless and costly foreign wars. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the LAW , not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. We will uphold your religious liberty, and defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. We will protect Medicare and Social Security. We will always, and very strongly, protect patients with pre-existing conditions, and that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party. We will END surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums. We will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain number one in the world, and keep America Energy Independent. We will win the race to 5G, and build the world's best cyber and missile defense. We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools, and always protect free speech on college campuses. We will launch a new age of American Ambition in Space. America will land the first WOMAN on the moon , and the United States will be the first nation to plant its flag on Mars. This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country TOGETHER. So tonight, I say again to all Americans: This is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties, or two individuals, in ideology, philosophy, or vision than there is right now. Our opponents believe that America is a depraved nation. We want our sons and daughters to know the truth: America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world! Our country wasn't built by cancel culture, speech codes, and soul-crushing conformity. We are NOT a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American Patriots. We are a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers and trailblazers who refused to be tied down, held back, or reined in. Americans have steel in their spines, grit in their souls, and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on earth. I want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background, in America, ANYONE CAN RISE. With hard work, devotion, and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition. Our American Ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn till dusk. These pioneers didn't have money, they didn't have fame, but they had each other. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God! When opportunity beckoned, they picked up their Bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into covered wagons, and set out West for the next adventure. Ranchers and miners, cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers , they pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the Wild Frontier. Legends were born , Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crockett, and Buffalo Bill. Americans built their beautiful homesteads on the Open Range. Soon they had churches and communities, then towns, and with time, great centers of industry and commerce. That is who they were. Americans build the future, we don't tear down the past! We are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the skyscrapers, revolutionized industry, and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature , and we did it all with style, confidence and flair. Because THAT is who we are. Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call. From Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima, American Patriots raced into cannon blasts, bullets and bayonets to rescue American Liberty. But America didn't stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a 6 million pound rocket, and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so that two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous American flag planted on the face of the Moon. For America, nothing is impossible. Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights. And we will show the world that, for America, no dream is beyond our reach. Together, we are unstoppable. Together, we are unbeatable. Because together, we are the proud CITIZENS of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. And on November 3rd, we will make America safer, we will make America stronger, we will make America prouder, and we will make America GREATER than ever before! Thank you, God Bless You. God Bless America , GOODNIGHT!"}

And I think it was very productive, about getting Big Ten playing again and immediately. And let's see what happens. He's a great guy. It's a great conference. Tremendous teams. And we're pushing very hard. I think the biggest headwind we have is that you have Democrats that don't want to see it happen. But I think they want to play, and the fans want to see it, and the players have a lot at stake, including possibly playing in the NFL. You have a lot of great players in that conference. So we had a very good conversation, very productive. And maybe we'll be very nicely surprised. They had it closed up, and I think they'd like to see it open, along with a lot of other football that's being played right now. So thank you very much. And thank you to Kevin. Q (Inaudible) with Jacob Blake or anyone related? THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q Will you be meeting with the family of Jacob Blake when you're in Wisconsin? THE PRESIDENT: I don't know yet. We'll see. We'll be making that determination. I don't know yet. Q Mr. President, can you tell us more about this plot that you were referring to on Fox News last night? THE PRESIDENT: The which? Q This plot of people gathering on a plane in gear that you were referring to. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I can tell you that , I can probably refer you to the person, and they could do it. I'd like to ask that person if it was okay. But a person was on a plane, said that there were about six people like that person, more or less. And what happened is the entire plane filled up with the looters, the anarchists, the rioters , people that obviously were looking for trouble. And the person felt very uncomfortable on the plane. This would be a person you know. So I will see whether or not I can get that person. I'll let them know, and I'll see whether or not I can get that person to speak to you. But this was a firsthand account of a plane going from Washington to wherever. And I'll see if I can get that information for you. Maybe they'll speak to you and maybe they won't. Q Are you concerned at all by the armed militias on the streets? Are they a worry or are they to be applauded? THE PRESIDENT: I think a lot of people are looking at what's happening to these Democrat-run cities, and they're disgusting. They see what's going on, and they can't believe this is taking place in our country. I can't believe it either. One of the reasons I'm making the trip today and going to Wisconsin is we've had such a big success in shutting down what would be, right now, a city , that would've been Kenosha , a city that would've been burnt to the ground by now. And we're going to really say hello to law enforcement and the National Guard. And it all stopped immediately upon the National Guard's arrival. So, you know, it'd be easy to stop. I saw last night where these radical anarchists were trying to get into the mayor's house, and lots of bad things were happening to this poor, foolish, very stupid mayor. I mean, how he could be mayor, I have no idea. But all he has to do is call and, within 10 minutes, their problem will be over. As you know, they have to call us. They have to call and request help. All he has to do is call, and the problem will end. They had tremendous numbers of people, really, harassing him horribly, and, I guess, trying to break into his house. And he still sticks up with him because he's a fool. Only a fool would stick up for them like that. These are anarchists. These are agitators. They're rioters. They're looters. They're bad people. They're burning down Portland. And you take a look at that. You take a look at the scenes last night. And then the fake-news media will say that they're friendly protesters. Because you people , I'll tell you, if we only had an honest press in this country, we'd be much more advanced. But we have a very dishonest press. Yes. Any other questions? Q Mr. President, can you speak at all , you've spoken a lot about the anarchy that you're referring to. What about racial divisions? Would you like to bridge some of those gaps? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I would. I would. Q And do you think that anything that you're saying is helping with that? THE PRESIDENT: I think it's helping because I'm about law and order. And if you look at the black community, they want the police to help them stop crime. The Hispanic community, they want police. Eighty-two percent, eighty-four percent , numbers that you haven't even seen , they don't want crime. They don't want to be mugged. They don't want to have any problems. And it's just a shame. And as far as the previous administration, take a look at Baltimore, what happened. Was it Freddie Gray? Take a look at Baltimore. Take a look at St. Louis. Take a look at Ferguson. Take a look at what happened. What they had was , it put what we're doing , it put them to shame , it put it to shame. Take a look at those places. And you always had Portland. Portland has been like this , I read an article today , for 50 years this has been going on. I'd like to stop it, and we could stop it quickly. All they have to do is say, \"Okay, President, now we're ready. Now we're ready.\" When I watched that scene last night, with all of those really horrible people outside of the mayor's house, I also saw the way they shot the young gentleman in the street. He was targeted. They targeted him. They shot him in the street, and then they were so happy, and he died. You don't mention that. You mention somebody spray-painted somebody from the other side. They shot a man in the street. They executed a man in the street , a religious man, in the street. And you don't mention it. It's not even a story. You talk about other things. The press should be ashamed of themselves. I think the press is actually , the media is what's fueling this, more so than even Biden, because Biden doesn't know he's alive. The press is really fueling this, and they're fueling it horribly. And you're doing a great disservice to your country. Okay. Any other questions? Q Are you going to speak with the governor about your visit? He obviously doesn't want you to show up. THE PRESIDENT: I may. No, I may. I'm also going to be speaking with a pastor who was talking to , as per your question previously , a very well involved and respected man. I look forward to that. I spoke to him yesterday, by the way , the pastor of the family, as you know. And I spoke to him yesterday. I had a great conversation. I think he's going to be there. But I'm speaking , really, today I'm there for law enforcement and for the National Guard because they've done a great job in Kenosha. They put out the flame immediately. As soon as they came in, boom, the flame was gone. Now maybe it'll start up again, in which case, they'll put it out very powerfully. Q Can you give us the latest on TikTok and what percentage you want, if any, of that deal? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I told them that they have until September 15th to make a deal. After that, we close it up in this country. And I said that the United States has to be compensated , well compensated , because we are the ones that are making it possible, and so we should be compensated. So the Treasury has to be well compensated. Q Mr. President, do you have an update on airlines , what your administration wants to do to help airlines? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we'll be helping the airlines. Yeah, we'll be helping the airlines. You have to help the airlines. It's a tough business , always is. Airlines are a tough business in good times, and we're about ready to get back to good times. If you look at the numbers this morning, some of the numbers coming out are incredible. We have now the all-time highest stock market, if you take the average. We're at a number that nobody would even believe. We're doing well. We have tremendous , I tell you, we have tremendous , what would you say is the best word? The enthusiasm for the country, the enthusiasm for the comeback , the \"V.\" You look at the \"V.\" Now I think it's a \"Super V.\" And Morgan Stanley, of course, which is one of the most respected on Wall Street, would you say? And they just made a big prediction. You know what the prediction was, right? That President Trump is going to remain President. So we'll have to see. We'll have to see. But I don't , I cannot imagine anything else. Because if somebody else got in , namely, my opponent , your stock markets, instead of being records right now, they will crash. Your 401(k)s will be down to nothing. Your stocks will be down to nothing. And we will have a depression like you've never seen before. We're going to have an incredible economy. Next year is going to be one of the best years that we've ever had. And everybody is getting a big tax cut. Thank you very much. Q Tell us the latest on drug pricing, sir. On drug pricing? The latest on that. THE PRESIDENT: We're working with the drug companies on substantially lowering drug prices. I've put out a favored nations clause; I've signed it. That means we get the lowest prices anywhere in the world. We match whoever gets the lowest. And the drug company is having a real problem with that. So they're coming in to see me, and we expect to get a very substantial price reduction in prescription drugs, which has never been done before. Q When are they coming to see you, sir? Do you know? THE PRESIDENT: They're coming. Yeah. They're coming this week.

And we're pushing very hard. I think the biggest headwind we have is that you have Democrats that don't want to see it happen. But I think they want to play, and the fans want to see it, and the players have a lot at stake, including possibly playing in the NFL. You have a lot of great players in that conference.

Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer that affects American men, and nearly 12 percent of men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime. Each year, more than 200,000 men are newly diagnosed, and more than 30,000 die from this disease. Individuals at the greatest risk for prostate cancer include African American men, men over the age of 65, and men with family histories of prostate or other cancers. While some signs, like trouble urinating and pelvic pain, may indicate the presence of prostate cancer, many men never experience any symptoms. Screening for prostate cancer using the prostate specific antigen test can identify abnormalities and may find cancer early so that affected men can begin treatment before it spreads. For this reason, all men aged 55 to 69 are encouraged to talk to their physicians about screening options. Thankfully, prostate cancer is treatable, and early detection can help save lives. My Administration remains committed to ensuring that Americans have access to necessary drugs and therapies to treat prostate cancer, as well as all other diseases they may face. That is why, in July of this year, I signed an Executive Order that eliminates kickbacks to drug company middlemen and passes on massive savings to consumers. This Executive Order will greatly improve prescription drug affordability. We will continue working to make all drugs more affordable to patients, including drugs to treat prostate and other cancers. This September, we affirm our support for all those battling prostate cancer. Together, we will work to provide every patient with affordable, reliable care, and look toward a future free from the scourge of this disease.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1463605\/presidential-message-on-national-prostate-cancer-awareness-month-2020&speechType=6","Summary":"Health and Health Care","Source":null,"Location":null,"Original source":"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/presidential-message-national-prostate-cancer-awareness-month-2020\/","CleanText":"During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we call attention to the struggles of men and families affected by prostate cancer, encourage understanding of the most common risk factors and treatments, and celebrate the victories and medical advances that give us hope that one day we will rid our Nation of this disease.

We extend our full support to those battling this disease, and we resolve to continue working to find new treatments and methods of care to defeat it. For the more than 20,000 American women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year, early detection is critical. Regular medical checkups and knowing the factors that place women at an increased risk for this disease, including age and family medical history, are important steps every American can take to help save lives. Additionally, awareness of certain common symptoms, like bloating, pelvic pain, and difficulty eating or urinating, can facilitate a potentially life-saving early diagnosis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 14,000 American women will lose their battle with ovarian cancer in 2020 alone. This tragedy strikes to the very core of our country, and my Administration remains committed to taking every available step to improve quality of care and increase access to treatment for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Since taking office, I have led a historic effort to cut regulations at a record pace to allow faster development of drugs and treatments, and in 2018 I signed Right to Try legislation, which expands access to potentially life-saving drugs. We will continue to cut regulations and put power in the hands of patients to choose the care that is best for them.

We had a very successful day. Pennsylvania was , that was incredible. The crowd was incredible. You saw what was unable to get in. We had thousands of people unable to get in. And I appreciate everybody being there. That was really a terrific moment, I think, coming off the plane. And it doesn't get any bigger than that. I did hear, though, when reentering the plane, I was told by Mark and Hope and some others that some horrible things were said. Fake things. Fake news. Corrupt news. The kind of news that's ruining your profession. And everyone knows it's totally false. General Keith Kellogg, who's a highly respected man, couldn't believe when he heard it. And he knows everything about , all of it. And to think that I would make statements negative to our military and our fallen heroes, when nobody has done what I've done, with the budgets, with the military budgets, with getting pay raises for our military. It is a disgraceful situation by a magazine that's a terrible magazine. I don't read it, but I just heard about it. They made it up. And, probably, it's a couple of people that have been failures in the administration that I got rid of. And I couldn't get rid of them fast enough. But , or it was just made up. But it's unthinkable. As far as John McCain is concerned, I was never a fan. And I will admit that openly. I disagreed with him on the endless wars. I disagreed with him with respect to the vets and the taking care of the VA. I wanted to do it a much different way. And I think it's proven to be a much more successful way when you look at the success we've had with the VA and with our vets, with Choice and with Accountability, all the things I've gotten. So I disagreed with John McCain, but I still respected him. And I had to approve his funeral as President. We lowered the flags. I had to approve that, nobody else. I had to approve it. When you think , as I'm just thinking back, I had to approve either Air Force One or a military plane to go to Arizona to pick up his casket. And I approved it immediately. I had to approve the funeral, because he had a first-class, triple-A funeral that lasted for nine days, by the way. I had to approve it. All of that had to be approved by the President. I approved it without hesitation and without complaint. And I felt he deserved it. I disagreed with him on things, and he was a tough guy, but I felt he deserved it. For somebody to say the things that they say I said is a total lie. It's fake news. It's a disgrace. And frankly, it's a disgrace to your profession. Now, with all of that being said, you'll speak to Keith Kellogg, you'll speak to other people, because many people knew. Let me just go into the , if I might, into the trip to Europe and to France. I was ready to go to a ceremony; I had two of them. One the following day; it was pouring, and I went to that. But the helicopter could not fly. The reason it couldn't fly is because it was raining about as hard as I've ever seen. And, on top of that, it was very, very foggy. And the helicopter was unable to fly. It was a fairly long helicopter flight, but it was a very long drive. In order for me to go, we would have had to leave immediately and go through very busy areas of, I guess, Paris , but a very, very heavily traveled area, a very , a big city. I think it was Paris. And the Secret Service told me, \"You can't do it.\" I said, \"I have to do it. I want to be there.\" They said, \"You can't do it.\" We'll get you confirmation on this. They said, \"For you to do that\" , make that trip not by helicopter flying over everything , \"we have to work with the police. We have to work with everything.\" And I think you'll find on record, in the police force, in the areas that we're talking about , areas of Paris that we're talking about , I think you'll find on-record requests. And we actually have Secret Service that I'm going to ask to give you details. They said, \"You can't do it.\" It was two and a half hours or two hours of driving. It was a long drive. They said, \"You can't do it.\" So I said, \"No, I want to do it.\" They said, \"You can't.\" There was no way I would have been able to do it. And they would never have been able to get the police and everybody else in line to have a President go through a very crowded, very congested area. So I went and I called home. I spoke to my wife. I said, \"I hate this. I came here to go to that ceremony,\" and to the one that was the following day, which I did go to. I said, \"I feel terribly.\" And that was the end of it. Now, all of a sudden, somebody makes up this horrible story that I didn't want to go. And then they make up an even worse story , an even worse story, calling certain names to our fallen heroes. It's a disgrace that a magazine is able to write it. And anybody that , if the , if they really exist, if people really exist that would have said that, they're low-lives and they're liars. And I would be willing to swear on anything that I never said that about our fallen heroes. There is nobody that respects them more. So I just think it's a horrible, horrible thing. We made a great evening into, frankly, a very sad evening, when I see a statement like that. No animal, nobody , what animal would say such a thing? And especially since I've done more, I think, than almost anybody to help our military, to get the budgets of our military, to get the pay raises for our military. So I just think it's a horrible thing that they're allowed to write that. And we can refute it. We have other people that will refute it. And the one I would like you to speak to is General Keith Kellogg, because he knows exactly the story. But you can also speak to Secret Service. They wouldn't let me go no matter what happened, because of security, because of safety. So I want to thank you for being here. There's nothing much more that I can say. All they're trying to do is influence a presidential election, where we've gone very high in the polls in the last short period of time, where we're doing very well, where we're going to win and they're going crazy. The magazine in question is a never-Trumper magazine, probably doing badly. I know nothing about it. I don't read it; I just heard about it now , about this story. But it's a total never-Trumper magazine and other people that are trying to influence the outcome of a presidential election. And you know what? People are too smart for it.

Great job numbers. You see what's happening with respect to the economy. A vaccine is looking very good for pretty soon. We'll talking about that a little bit later on. We're going to Florida. We're going to North Carolina. We're doing a double stop. We'll be doing some triples along the way, but right now we're, sort of, in the earlier stages. The poll numbers you saw were very good. They're really getting good despite all of the disinformation campaigns that the Democrats run. Pure disinformation. So we're doing very well. We'll have a good trip today, and I'll see you during the trip. Any questions? Q (Inaudible) spend any money on your own campaign? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, if I have to, I would. But we're doing very well. We needed to spend more money up front because of the pandemic and the statements being made by Democrats, which were, again, disinformation. We've done a great job with COVID. We've done a great job with the China virus , a great job. Whether it's ventilators or whether it's vaccines, which you'll be seeing very soon, or therapeutics, we've done a great job. But the press was fake, and we have to spend a lot of money. No, if we need , if we did need , we don't, because we have much more money than we had last time going into the last two months; I think double and triple. But if we needed any more, I'd put it up personally, like I did in the primaries last time. In the 2016 primaries, I put up a lot of money. If I have to, I'll do it here.

They're afraid to even talk about law and order. They can't issue the words \"law and order.\" All we want is law and order. And I just put out something: The suburbs are coming big to us because the suburbs are next. If you elected this guy, the suburbs would be overwhelmed with violence and crime. So that's where we are. This is the most important election in the history of our country. So that's it. We'll see you in Florida. Thank you very much.

{"SpeechID":"VSDT992020399","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-09-09","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump on Judicial Appointments","Type":"speech","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, my fellow Americans. Apart from matters of war and peace, the nomination of a Supreme Court justice is the most important decision an American President can make. For this reason, candidates for President owe the American people a specific list of the individuals they consider for the United States Supreme Court. Four years ago, I announced my first list of highly qualified candidates and promised to fill Justice Scalia's vacant seat from among , from among those names. Just days after my inauguration, I kept that promise when I nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch. And, as you know, he has been very spectacular. A year later, I nominated and the Senate confirmed another outstanding justice, Brett Kavanaugh. By the end of my first term, we will have confirmed a record number of federal judges , over 300 , all of whom will faithfully uphold our Constitution as written. What has always made America exceptional is our reverence for the impartial rule of law. People have come here from all over the world to pursue the American Dream based on this sacred principle. Equality under the law is the bedrock of our society. It is the principle that inspired American heroes to abolish slavery and end segregation, secure civil rights, and build the most free and just nation in history. Unfortunately, there is a growing radical-left movement that rejects the principle of equal treatment under law. If this extreme movement is granted a majority on the Supreme Court, it will fundamentally transform America without a single vote of Congress. Radical justices will erase the Second Amendment, silence political speech, and require taxpayers to fund extreme late-term abortion. They will give unelected bureaucrats that power to destroy millions of American jobs. They will remove the words \"under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance. They will unilaterally declare the death penalty unconstitutional, even for the most depraved mass murderers. They will erase national borders, cripple police departments, and grant new protections to anarchists, rioters, violent criminals, and terrorists. In the recent past, many of our most treasured freedoms, including religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, have been saved by a single vote on the United States Supreme Court. Our cherished rights are at risk, including the right to life and our great Second Amendment. Over the next four years, America's President will choose hundreds of federal judges, and, in all likelihood, one, two, three, and even four Supreme Court justices. The outcome of these decisions will determine whether we hold fast to our nation's founding principles or whether they are lost forever. That is why today I am announcing 20 additions to my original list of candidates for the United States Supreme Court. Should there be another vacancy on the Supreme Court during my presidency, my nominee will come from the names I have shared with the American public, including the original list and these 20 additions. Joe Biden has refused to release his list, perhaps because he knows the names are so extremely far left that they could never withstand public scrutiny or receive acceptance. He must release a list of justices for people to properly make a decision as to how they will vote. It is very important that he do so. My original list of potential justices include many of our nation's brightest legal minds, such as Bill Pryor, Amy Coney Barrett, and Thomas Hardiman. Outstanding people. Like those distinguished individuals, the 20 additions I am announcing today would be jurists in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. Their names are as follows: Bridget Bade of Arizona, judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of AppealsDaniel Cameron of Kentucky, Attorney General of the Commonwealth of KentuckyPaul Clement of Virginia, former Solicitor General of the United StatesSenator Tom Cotton of ArkansasSenator Ted Cruz of TexasStuart Kyle Duncan of Louisiana, judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of AppealsSteven Engel of the District of Columbia, Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of JusticeNoel Francisco, former Solicitor General of the United StatesSenator Josh Hawley of MissouriJames Ho of Texas, judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of AppealsGregory Katsas of Virginia, judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of AppealsBarbara Lagoa of Florida, judge on the Eleventh Circuit Court of AppealsChristopher Landau of Maryland, United States Ambassador to MexicoCarlos Mu\u00f1iz of Florida, justice on the Supreme Court of FloridaMartha Pacold of Illinois, judge on the District Court for the Northern District of IllinoisPeter Phipps of Pennsylvania, judge on the Third Circuit Court of AppealsSarah Pitlyk of Missouri, judge on the District Court for the Eastern District of MissouriAllison Jones Rushing of North Carolina, judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of AppealsKate Todd of Virginia, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Counsel to the PresidentLawrence VanDyke of Nevada, judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of AppealsEvery one of these individuals will ensure equal justice, equal treatment, and equal rights for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. Together, we will defend our righteous heritage and preserve our magnificent American way of life.Thank you. God Bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Q Mr. President, why did you intentionally downplay the , Does anybody have any questions on the judges? Please. Q I do, sir. Why did , THE PRESIDENT: Anybody? On the judges? Excuse me. Any questions? They're outstanding people. Very important decision. Very important that Joe Biden put up potential nominees. I think it's a very important thing for our country that he do that. Okay? Please, go ahead. Do you have a question? Question? Q Mr. President, have you spoken to these candidates? Q Mr. President, can you address the concerns from the Woodward book in regards to whether , did you mislead the public by saying that you downplayed the coronavirus and that you repeatedly did that in order to reduce panic? Did you mislead the public? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think if you said \"in order to reduce panic,\" perhaps that's so. The fact is, I'm a cheerleader for this country, I love our country, and I don't want people to be frightened. I don't want to create panic, as you say. And certainly, I'm not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. We want to show confidence. We want to show strength. We want to show strength as a nation. And that's what I've done. And we've done very well. We've done well from any standard. You look at our numbers, compared to other countries, other parts of the world. It's been an amazing job that we've done. I think it's very sad, in many respects, because the incredible individuals working so hard on it, including our Vice President, they've done this great job. They haven't been acknowledged by the news media , and they should , for the job we've done. Whether it's ventilators , and now, you'll see very soon, with vaccines and with therapeutics, the job we've done has been incredible. Q But, Mr. President , THE PRESIDENT: But we don't want to , we don't want to instill panic. We don't want to jump up and down and start shouting that we have a problem that is a , a tremendous problem , scare everybody. And I'll tell you the other thing: We immediately started buying. All over the world, we started buying masks and gowns and everything else. And we don't want to cause pricing to go up to a level that becomes almost unaffordable. So , Q But, Mr. President , THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, in that sense , so, in that sense, I agree with it. Yeah, please. Q Mr. President, how do you reassure the American public, going forward, that they can trust what you're saying? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that's really a big part of trust. We have to have leadership. We have to show leadership. And the last thing you want to do is create a panic in the country. This was a horrible thing. It was sent to us by China. It should not have happened , should never have happened. This is a disgusting, terrible situation that was foisted upon us. And we have to show , we just don't want to use , the best word is \"panic.\" We don't want to have to show panic. We're not going to show panic. And that's exactly what I did. And I was very open , whether it's to Woodward or anybody else. It's just another political hit job. But whether it was Woodward or anybody else, you cannot show a sense of panic or you're going to have bigger problems than you ever had before. Please. Q Respectfully, sir, your comments amounted to more than trying to reduce panic, sir. On February 7th, you told Woodward , THE PRESIDENT: Please, please. Q , \"It's more deadly than [even] your strenuous flu.\" But , THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me, he's , he's going. Q But then, publicly, you weren't saying that at all. THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, please. Q Look, Mr. President, don't you think if you were more forthright with the American, more lives could have been saved? Do you take responsibility at all for some of the 200,000 deaths that we've had? THE PRESIDENT: So, I think if we didn't do what we did, we would have had millions of people die. We closed up our country. We closed it up very, very quickly, very effectively. We did a job. We learned about this horrible disease, along with the rest of the world, which had to learn about it. And then we opened it up. And now we know the vulnerable; we know who it attacks, who it's so vicious against. And I think we've done, from every standpoint, a , a incredible job. We shouldn't have lost anybody. Nobody should have lost , China released something that they shouldn't have been allowed to re- , they should not have released. It came out of China. It went to Europe. It went all over the world. It should have never happened. They could have stopped it. They stopped it from going into the remainder of China. It started in Wuhan, and they stopped it. But they didn't stop it from coming to our country. Now, we had to show calm. We had to show , you know, if it was up to you or whoever , I have no idea what he said in the book. And again, it's a book that , I gave him some quotes and, frankly, we'll see how the book turned out. I have no idea. You're asking me questions for the first time. But, again, the last thing we can show is panic or excitement or fear or anything else. We had to take care of the , we had to take care of the situation we were given. Now, long before anybody else wanted to do it, I closed our borders to a very heavily infected China. If I didn't do that, we would have had hundreds of thousands more people die. Dr. Fauci said it. Many people said it. It was a great decision. It was a decision I made and I had to make. It was a decision that a lot of people thought I was wrong. Nancy Pelosi said I was wrong. Joe Bo- , Biden said I was wrong. They all came back, and they said it was the right decision. And I was way early. That was in January. The end of January, I did that. So that was a very good thing we did. Otherwise, we would have had hundreds of thousands more. But if we didn't close the country, we would have been talking about millions of people, instead of the numbers that we have right now. Go ahead. Q Mr. President, you mentioned that you were trying to avoid price gouging. But you mentioned to Bob Woodward that you recognized, as this virus spread through the air, in , on February 7th , you didn't begin Project Air Bridge until March; you didn't use the Defense Production Act until March; you didn't start ramping up ventilator production until March. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I mean, you didn't , you didn't really think it was going to be to the point where it was. All of a sudden, the world was infected. The entire world was infected. Everyone was scrambling around, looking where to buy facemasks and all of the other things. We've opened up factories. We've had tremendous success with facemasks and with shields and with the ventilators. We're now supplying the rest of the world. We have all the ventilators we can use. And remember this: The ventilators were very important. Not one person that needed a ventilator didn't get it. And these are very complex, expensive machines to make. We opened up something like hadn't been done since the Second World War. We , honestly, we've done a , an incredible job. But we don't want to run around, screaming, shouting, \"Oh, look at this. Look at this.\" We have to show leadership. And leadership is all about confidence. And confidence is confidence in our country. And our people have been great. We've been put through a lot by China. By releasing this, by having this come here, we were put through a lot. They could have done something about it, and they chose not to. I am very honored to have presented to you today a list of 20 incredible people. And we will talk later. I'm sure we'll be meeting later in the day. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Big 10 is looking very strongly at opening up their season, but we're not getting any cooperation from the governor of Michigan. We have , we need some cooperation also from North Carolina, the governor of North Carolina. Tremendous economic activity; auto plants opening up, auto plants being expanded. Michigan is doing really well. They had the best year in their history last year. And when the plague came in, we had to shut it down and then open it up. But the problem with a few states is governors , Democrat governors all , are not opening up, and they have to open up. So we look forward to a good time. I hear we have a big crowd, like we had in Pennsylvania, frankly, and North Carolina and everywhere we go , New Hampshire. We're having very big crowds. And we're going to have a big crowd. I understand a very big one in Michigan when we land; we're doing it at the hangars in the airport. So we'll see you there. Anybody have any questions? Q Mr. President, have you seen the whistleblower report? Have you seen the whistleblower report? THE PRESIDENT: No, I haven't seen it. Is that another fake whistleblower, like the one we had? I mean, we had one , a whistleblower , who wrote a totally different report than my conversation. So, you know, it sounds like a Schiff. Who's the whistleblower? Schiff? Q No, it's a , it's an official at DHS who says that intelligence reports were manipulated to make you look better. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I can't imagine that, but you'll have to ask the Secretary. I will say this: If it's anything like the last whistleblower report, which was a joke, which was a fake, and frankly, how he gets away , how he even got away with it is disgusting, if he actually did get away with it. We'll find out about that. But these are fake reports. I will tell you, I'm not referring to a new one. You're just telling me that for the first time. The whistleblower report that we had was totally different than the conversation that it covered. It was a fake report. So this is politics, and it's a disgrace. But ask Chad Wolf. He's the one that would know something about it. Q On TikTok, can you tell us how much closer you are? Do you have bids to , THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, TikTok is moving along. We'll see what happens. It'll either be closed up or they'll sell it. So we'll either close up TikTok in this country for security reasons, or it'll be sold. Q Will you extend the deadline if there are negotiations? THE PRESIDENT: I'm not extending deadlines, no. It's September 15th. There'll be no extension of the TikTok deadline. Q Did you share classified information about a nuclear weapons system with Woodward? What were you talking about when you talked about that? THE PRESIDENT: No, we have great, great weaponry. No, I'm not talking about classified; I'm talking about what we build. We're building great weaponry. Our military is stronger now than it's ever been. We spent $2.5 trillion on our military over the last three, three and a half years. And we now have new rockets and missiles. And, frankly, our nuclear , we have to hope to God we never have to use it , but our nuclear now is in the best shape it's been in decades. Q But you mentioned a system that nobody knows about during your conversations with him. THE PRESIDENT: There are systems that nobody knows about, including you, and we have some systems that nobody knows about. And, frankly, I think I'm better off keeping it that way. We have some incredible systems. Q Mr. President, what did you mean when you said you \"saved MBS's ass\" to Woodward? What did you mean when you said you saved him?

THE PRESIDENT: I don't know. Q It looks like it's off the table. THE PRESIDENT: Right now, the Democrats don't want to pass it. They don't want to help, really, the workers of our country. They didn't deserve this. This was given to us by China. But Nancy Pelosi and Schumer don't want to pass a stimulus bill because they think that helps me in the election. I don't think it helps me at all. We are prepared to pass stimulus for people that need it. Again, it wasn't their fault; it was China's fault. So we're prepared to do it, but I have a feeling the Democrats won't do it. In the meantime, our economy is very good. We're in a \"super V.\" We're doing numbers that were , are much better than anybody ever thought possible. We had the best four months of hiring that we've ever had , I guess it was 10.4 million people , in the history of our country. Our retail numbers, as you saw, came out.

Thank you very much. Thank you, David, very much. It's a great honor to be with you. Nineteen years ago, on this day, at this very hour, on this field, 40 brave men and women triumphed over terror and gave their lives in defense of our nation. Their names and their stories are forever inscribed on the eternal roll call of American heroes. Today, we pay tribute to their sacrifice, and we mourn deeply for the nearly 3,000 precious and beautiful souls who were taken from us on September 11th, 2001. To the family members of Flight 93: Today, every heartbeat in America is wedded to yours. Your pain and anguish is the shared grief of our whole nation. The memory of your treasured loved ones will inspire America for all time to come. The heroes of Flight 93 are an everlasting reminder that no matter the danger, no matter the threat, no matter the odds, America will always rise up, stand tall, and fight back. To every 9\/11 member all across this nation: The First Lady and I come to this hallowed ground deeply aware that we cannot fill the void in your heart or erase the terrible sorrow of this day. The agony renewed, the nightmare relived, the wounds reopened, the last treasured words played over and over again in your minds. But while we cannot erase your pain, we can help to shoulder your burden. We promise that unwavering love that you so want and need, support, devotion , and the very special devotion , of all Americans. On that September morning, when America was under attack, the battle turned in the skies above this field. Soon after taking off from Newark, New Jersey, radical Islamic terrorists seized control of United 93. Other hijacked planes struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center, and then the South Tower, and then the Pentagon. The terrorists on Flight 93 had a fourth target in mind. It was called: our nation's capital. They were just 20 minutes away from reaching their sinister objective. The only thing that stood between the enemy and a deadly strike at the heart of American democracy was the courage and resolve of 40 men and women , the amazing passengers and crew of Flight 93. Donald and Jean Peterson were grandparents traveling to vacation in California. Deora Bodley was a student headed back to college. Richard Guadagno was returning from celebrating his grandmother's 100th birthday. Lauren Catuzzi Grandcolas was three months pregnant with her first child. Every passenger and crewmember on the plane had a life filled with love and joy, friends and family, radiant hopes and limitless dreams. When the plane was hijacked, they called their families and learned that America was also under attack. Then they faced the most fateful moment of their lives. Through the heartache and the tears, they prayed to God, they placed their last calls home, they whispered the immortal words, \"I love you.\" Today, those words ring out across these sacred grounds, and they shine down on us from Heaven above. When terrorists raced to destroy the seat of our democracy, the 40 of Flight 93 did the most American of things: They took a vote, and then they acted. Together, they charged the cockpit, they confronted the pure evil, and in their last act on this Earth, they saved our capital. In this Pennsylvania field, the 40 intrepid souls of Flight 93 died as true heroes. Their momentous deeds will outlive us all. In the days and weeks after 9\/11, citizens of all faiths, backgrounds, colors, and creeds came together, prayed together, mourned together, and rebuilt together. The song \"God Bless America\" became a rallying cry for the nation. We were united by our conviction that America was the world's most exceptional country, blessed with the most incredible heroes, and that this was a land worth defending with our very last breath. It was a unity based on love for our families, care for our neighbors, loyalty to our fellow citizens, pride in our great flag, gratitude for our police and first responders, faith in God, and a refusal to bend our will to the depraved forces of violence, intimidation, oppression, and evil. In New York, Arlington, and Shanksville, people raced into the suffocating smoke and rubble. At Ground Zero, the world witnessed the miracle of American courage and sacrifice. As ash rained down, police officers, first responders, and firefighters ran into the fires of hell. On that day, more than 400 first responders gave their lives, including 23 New York City police officers, 37 Port Authority workers, and 343 New York City firefighters. Today, we honor their extraordinary sacrifice and every first responder who keeps America safe. With us today is David DeMato, a retired Chicago police officer and a current officer of the Navy Reserves. On 9\/11, he drove from Chicago to Ground Zero. As David says, \"While the sights and smells of working at Ground Zero will forever be etched in my mind, what is more profound is the way this country came together afterwards. The police officers and firemen were revered as the heroes they truly are; the military was appreciated in a manner not seen in decades; and common people found new meaning in values like friendship, kindness, and selflessness.\" Thank you, David. Such beautiful words. And thank you to every member of law enforcement who risks their lives to ensure our safety and uphold our peace. This morning, we also remember the 183 people who were killed in the attack on the Pentagon and the remarkable service members who crawled straight through the raging blaze to rescue their comrades. We express our undying loyalty to the nearly 6 million young men and women who have enlisted in the United States armed forces since September 11th, 2001. More than 7,000 military heroes have laid down their lives since 9\/11 to preserve our freedom. No words can express the summit of their glory or the infinite depth of our gratitude. But we will strive every single day to repay our immeasurable debt and prove worthy of their supreme sacrifice. America will never relent in pursuing terrorists that threaten our people. Less than one year ago, American warriors took out the savage killer and leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. Soon after, our warriors ended the brutal reign of the Iranian butcher who murdered thousands of American service members. The world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, is dead. Here in Shanksville, this community locked arms and hearts in the wake of tragedy. With us today is Chuck Wagner, a heavy equipment operator who lives just a few miles away. Very soon after the attack, Chuck helped search for the black box. He was so changed by what he experienced that he joined with several members of his church to become what they call \"Ambassadors\" for the 40 men and women on Flight 93. Chuck and his neighbors learned about each person, cared for their families, and each day, rain or shine, they took shifts standing vigil over their final resting place. Long before this place was a national memorial, back when it was marked by a simple wooden cross, Chuck and his fellow Ambassadors were always here waiting to tell visitors about those we lost. Nineteen years later, Chuck says his life is devoted to three things: his family, his church, and preserving the memory of the men and women of Flight 93. To Chuck, his wife Jayne , (applause) , thank you very much. Thank you very much. To Chuck and his wife Jayne, thank you so much for being here. And to the over 40 Ambassadors with us today, please stand and receive America's thanks. And this is a very deep thanks. Please. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Also with us is Marine veteran Jason Thomas, from Long Island. On September 11th, Jason had just retired from the Marines. But he immediately put back on his uniform and raced into the nightmare of ash and debris. At Ground Zero, he found a fellow Marine, Dave Karnes. Together, they began to call out: \"United States Marines! United States Marines! If you can hear us, yell, tap. Do whatever you can do. We're the United States Marines.\" Soon they heard a shout for help. Two police officers were trapped beneath 20 feet of rubble. Jason and Dave dug for hours on end knowing that, at any moment, the wreckage could come down on them, crushing them alive. At one point, someone told Jason to stop. Jason replied, \"I'm a Marine. I don't go back. I go forward.\" That day, Jason helped save the lives of those two officers. For years, Jason said nothing about what he did on 9\/11. He did not even tell his five children. But when he saw the rescue recounted on TV, he decided to meet those officers. One of them gave him a gift: a steel cross made from a beam that Jason helped lift to free them from the hell on Earth. As Jason said about the cross, \"It means a lot. It's a symbol of what we are as Americans. Because that day, we all came together and stood as a nation, as Americans. It didn't matter what race you were, what religion you were. It didn't matter. We all came together to help one another. I'd die for this country. I'd die for this country.\" Jason, thank you very much for bearing witness to the character of our nation. Jason, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you, Jason. The men and women of Flight 93 were mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, husbands and wives. Nothing could have prepared them for the dreadful events of that morning. But when the moment came, when history called, they did not hesitate, they did not waver. Forty towering patriots rose up, took charge, made their stand, turned the tide, and changed the course of history forever. Our sacred task, our righteous duty, and our solemn pledge is to carry forward the noble legacy of the brave souls who gave their lives for us 19 years ago. In their memory, we resolve to stand united as one American nation, to defend our freedoms, to uphold our values, to love our neighbors, to cherish our country, to care for our communities, to honor our heroes, and to never, ever forget. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the heroes of Flight 93. God bless all of the families. 9\/11 , we'll never forget. God bless you all, and God bless America. Thank you very much. (Applause.)

Thank you very much. Thank you, David, very much. It's a great honor to be with you. Nineteen years ago, on this day, at this very hour, on this field, 40 brave men and women triumphed over terror and gave their lives in defense of our nation. Their names and their stories are forever inscribed on the eternal roll call of American heroes. Today, we pay tribute to their sacrifice, and we mourn deeply for the nearly 3,000 precious and beautiful souls who were taken from us on September 11th, 2001. To the family members of Flight 93: Today, every heartbeat in America is wedded to yours. Your pain and anguish is the shared grief of our whole nation. The memory of your treasured loved ones will inspire America for all time to come. The heroes of Flight 93 are an everlasting reminder that no matter the danger, no matter the threat, no matter the odds, America will always rise up, stand tall, and fight back. To every 9\/11 member all across this nation: The First Lady and I come to this hallowed ground deeply aware that we cannot fill the void in your heart or erase the terrible sorrow of this day. The agony renewed, the nightmare relived, the wounds reopened, the last treasured words played over and over again in your minds. But while we cannot erase your pain, we can help to shoulder your burden. We promise that unwavering love that you so want and need, support, devotion , and the very special devotion , of all Americans. On that September morning, when America was under attack, the battle turned in the skies above this field. Soon after taking off from Newark, New Jersey, radical Islamic terrorists seized control of United 93. Other hijacked planes struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center, and then the South Tower, and then the Pentagon. The terrorists on Flight 93 had a fourth target in mind. It was called: our nation's capital. They were just 20 minutes away from reaching their sinister objective. The only thing that stood between the enemy and a deadly strike at the heart of American democracy was the courage and resolve of 40 men and women , the amazing passengers and crew of Flight 93. Donald and Jean Peterson were grandparents traveling to vacation in California. Deora Bodley was a student headed back to college. Richard Guadagno was returning from celebrating his grandmother's 100th birthday. Lauren Catuzzi Grandcolas was three months pregnant with her first child. Every passenger and crewmember on the plane had a life filled with love and joy, friends and family, radiant hopes and limitless dreams. When the plane was hijacked, they called their families and learned that America was also under attack. Then they faced the most fateful moment of their lives. Through the heartache and the tears, they prayed to God, they placed their last calls home, they whispered the immortal words, 'I love you.' Today, those words ring out across these sacred grounds, and they shine down on us from Heaven above. When terrorists raced to destroy the seat of our democracy, the 40 of Flight 93 did the most American of things: They took a vote, and then they acted. Together, they charged the cockpit, they confronted the pure evil, and in their last act on this Earth, they saved our capital. In this Pennsylvania field, the 40 intrepid souls of Flight 93 died as true heroes. Their momentous deeds will outlive us all. In the days and weeks after 9\/11, citizens of all faiths, backgrounds, colors, and creeds came together, prayed together, mourned together, and rebuilt together. The song 'God Bless America' became a rallying cry for the nation. We were united by our conviction that America was the world's most exceptional country, blessed with the most incredible heroes, and that this was a land worth defending with our very last breath. It was a unity based on love for our families, care for our neighbors, loyalty to our fellow citizens, pride in our great flag, gratitude for our police and first responders, faith in God, and a refusal to bend our will to the depraved forces of violence, intimidation, oppression, and evil. In New York, Arlington, and Shanksville, people raced into the suffocating smoke and rubble. At Ground Zero, the world witnessed the miracle of American courage and sacrifice. As ash rained down, police officers, first responders, and firefighters ran into the fires of hell. On that day, more than 400 first responders gave their lives, including 23 New York City police officers, 37 Port Authority workers, and 343 New York City firefighters. Today, we honor their extraordinary sacrifice and every first responder who keeps America safe. With us today is David DeMato, a retired Chicago police officer and a current officer of the Navy Reserves. On 9\/11, he drove from Chicago to Ground Zero. As David says, 'While the sights and smells of working at Ground Zero will forever be etched in my mind, what is more profound is the way this country came together afterwards. The police officers and firemen were revered as the heroes they truly are; the military was appreciated in a manner not seen in decades; and common people found new meaning in values like friendship, kindness, and selflessness.' Thank you, David. Such beautiful words. And thank you to every member of law enforcement who risks their lives to ensure our safety and uphold our peace. This morning, we also remember the 183 people who were killed in the attack on the Pentagon and the remarkable service members who crawled straight through the raging blaze to rescue their comrades. We express our undying loyalty to the nearly 6 million young men and women who have enlisted in the United States armed forces since September 11th, 2001. More than 7,000 military heroes have laid down their lives since 9\/11 to preserve our freedom. No words can express the summit of their glory or the infinite depth of our gratitude. But we will strive every single day to repay our immeasurable debt and prove worthy of their supreme sacrifice. America will never relent in pursuing terrorists that threaten our people. Less than one year ago, American warriors took out the savage killer and leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. Soon after, our warriors ended the brutal reign of the Iranian butcher who murdered thousands of American service members. The world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, is dead. Here in Shanksville, this community locked arms and hearts in the wake of tragedy. With us today is Chuck Wagner, a heavy equipment operator who lives just a few miles away. Very soon after the attack, Chuck helped search for the black box. He was so changed by what he experienced that he joined with several members of his church to become what they call 'Ambassadors' for the 40 men and women on Flight 93. Chuck and his neighbors learned about each person, cared for their families, and each day, rain or shine, they took shifts standing vigil over their final resting place.

They're behind the hangar. So thank you for being here. We have meetings with FEMA, and we have meetings with a lot of people, having to do with California, Washington State, and Oregon. And I think they'll go very well. They're doing an incredible job. This is one of the biggest burns we've ever seen, and we have to do a lot about forest management. Obviously, forest management in California is very important. And now it extends to Washington and extends also to Oregon. There has to be good, strong forest management, which I've been talking about for three years with this state. So hopefully they'll start doing that. In the meantime, we're helping them up , out in a very big way. We have the best people in the world doing this. We have all of our people from FEMA. We have law enforcement here. We have the Army Corps of Engineers. We have, basically, some other military and military operatives that do this. And I'm going to meet with the governor right now, Gavin Newsom. We've worked very well together. I've approved the emergency declaration, as you know. And I think we'll have a very good meeting. I think you're going to be able to go in, take a few pictures , a shot. We may or may not keep you there. As far as I'm concerned, I'd be okay with it, but maybe , maybe the state would rather not have that, and that's okay with me too. So we're going to go in right now. Then we're going, as you know, to Arizona. We're meeting with a very great group of people , Hispanic people who have done really well and they understand exactly what's happening. And we've had tremendous support, as you know and you can see from, probably, everything, including polls. I don't give a lot of significance to polls, even though we've been getting very good polls. We just got a very good one from Rasmussen, as you probably saw. And we certainly got a very good one from within the Republican Party: 95 to 96 percent. So we're going to do our meeting now with the state officials, including the governor, and then I'll see you in a little while. And then ultimately , and we're also giving seven medals to seven great, really, heroes , really, truly heroes. And I look forward to doing that. We'll be doing that. We're going to have a little bit of a press conference inside. Okay? Q What would you like to see, specifically, done on the issue of forest management? And is it possible that it's also forest management and climate change , it's both of things at the same time? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think something is possible. I think a lot of things are possible. But with regard to the forest: When trees fall down, after a short period of time , about 18 months , they become very dry. They become, really, like a matchstick. And they get up , you know, there's no more water pouring through, and they become very, very , well, they just explode. They can explode. Also, leaves , when you have years of leaves , dried leaves , on the ground, it just sets it up. It's really a fuel for a fire. So they have to do something about it. They also have to do cuts. I mean, people don't like to do cuts, but they have to do cuts in between. So if you do have a fire and it gets away, you'll have a 50-yard cut in between so it won't be able to catch to the other side. They don't do that. If you go to other countries , you go to Austria, you go to Finland, you go to many different countries, and they don't have , I was talking to a head of a major country, and he said, \"We're a forest nation. We consider ourself a forest nation.\" This was in Europe. I said, \"That's a beautiful term.\" He said, \"We have trees that are far more explosive \" , he meant \"explosive\" in terms of fire , \" but we have trees that are more explosive they have in California, and we don't have any problem because we manage our forests.\" So we have to do that in California, too. So I'll go do this, and we'll see you in a little while. Thank you. Thank you. (The President walks nearby to speak with supporters and local press.) THE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) I love California. I love all of our first responders and FEMA. And we're here to see your governor, to see a lot of your state representatives, but we're also here to see FEMA and thank them for the great job they're doing. We have an army of people here, and it's very dangerous work. We're going to give away seven medals. I guess some of you will be in there to see the ceremony. I want to thank you for being here. It's a great honor to be here. We're going to Arizona after this, but we're also paying our respects to Oregon and the State of Washington. We're helping them very strongly. We're going to be discussing that inside with FEMA. And they also have a very explosive situation. So we'll be talking about Oregon, the State of Washington, California. This is one of the biggest they've ever had. So we talk about forest management. And I've been talking about it for a long time , that they have to do that. You go to other countries, and they don't have this problem, and they have more explosive trees , meaning they catch fire much easier. So we have to talk about that, in addition to other things. But we've been working very well with Gavin. We've been working very well with the state. We approved emergency declarations. And hopefully, it'll be under control fairly soon. We want to pay our respects to the families and loved ones. We had a number of people die, unfortunately. They got caught. They got caught. And when you get caught in these things, it's really be bad. It's really bad. So we want to pay our respects. God bless all. We want to pay our respects to the families where they've lost , they've lost some wonderful people, from what I understand. Q Mr. President, what role do you think climate change plays in the fires we're seeing here? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think this is more of a management situation. You know, if you look at other countries , you go to other countries in Europe , Austria and Finland and numerous countries , and I talk to the heads. They're , they're forest nations. They're in forests. And they don't have problems like this. And they have very explosive trees, but they don't have problems like this. So I view that as , number one, that's something we can do something about quickly. When you get into climate change , well, is India going to change its ways? And is China going to change its ways? And Russia , is Russia going to change its ways? You know, so you have a lot of countries that are going to have to change because they make up , we're just a small speck. They make up a big preponderance of the pollution. And so you have to get them to do it, and nobody ever talks about that. (Cross-chatter.) You like that, right? Look at him. He likes , I like you. SUPPORTER: I love you, sir! Q (Inaudible) is run by , owned by the federal government. What is the plan to do something about that? THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q The plan. The plan , with the government. Q What is the plan? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we would help them with respect to forest management. And we'll, you know, work along with them, and we already are. We've done large sections of land owned by the federal government. And, you know, forest management is not only the leaves that have been sitting there for many years that are dry as a bone, but there are also the trees that go over. Anytime , anything over 18 months, that's just like a matchstick. It's absolutely like a matchstick. And the standing trees, as you know, they're taking in water. They're wet, and they're much harder to catch. So, they have to do forest management. They also have to do cuts , 50-yard cuts , so that if you have a section that goes, it's not going to take the whole, you know, 100,000 acres. So, you do cuts, and you can do them in ways that look, actually, very good. But you have to be able to do them. So, you know, we'll be talking about that. It's very important. The management is very important. That's why you always have them here. When you think of it, you see it in Europe, it doesn't happen to , they manage , well, it doesn't happen much. I'll have to be exact with you people. You understand that. But it doesn't happen much because they manage their forests, and they manage it brilliantly, and they've been doing that for many years. Other places, it doesn't happen where they manage their forests, and it should happen here. And they've done something , and I will tell you, federal government is now starting to do it in a very big way, but the state has to really do that , that includes the State of Washington, that includes Oregon. Q The governor says that , the governor says that forest management , THE PRESIDENT: Say it? What? Q , is a big issue. But he says , THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q He says forest management is a big issue , Governor Newsom. But he says, fundamentally, this is a climate crisis. THE PRESIDENT: Well, that's up to him. Look, he does agree with me on forest management. You have to understand, when I first started talking about it, three years ago, nobody agreed with me. Now everybody agrees that forest management is a very important subject, and you can do it beautifully. But if you did manage your forest, and if you removed all of that really dry and just , it's like , \"explosive\" is the only word. You drop a cigarette on it, you come back a half hour later, and you have a forest fire. If you don't have that sitting there, nothing is going to burn. Because the last thing to go are the bases of the trees because they're soaking wet from the tree soaking up the water. So they have to be able to do that. If they do that, they're going to have a much different situation. But every year, it's the same thing, and this one is a very big one. This is a number of big ones. You put them together, and it's , it's a big monster. Q What do you say , what do you say to (inaudible) , say something about California (inaudible)? Do you , THE PRESIDENT: No, no, I said it immediately. And I spoke , Q Do you care about the blue states (inaudible)? THE PRESIDENT: Let me just tell you , let me just tell you about your nasty question. I got a call from the governor immediately, and I called him immediately. In fact, he returned my call. And on that call, I declared it a national , an emergency. I gave an emergency declaration. That was immediate. So don't tell me about not doing, because I gave immediate. That included FEMA coming here immediately, while it was just starting , FEMA and everything else. So that's a nasty question. Q What is your relationship with Governor Newsom? THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q What is your relationship with Governor Newsom? THE PRESIDENT: I think it's very good. We have a good relationship. We're obviously from different sides of the spectrum, but we have a very good relationship. We've worked well. And as I've said, as soon as this started, we spoke right at the beginning, and I gave a , an emergency declaration. And he will tell you that. He thanked me. Because a lot of Presidents wait for months and months and months. They wait until after it's all over, and then they consider it, and then oftentimes they don't do it. I did it right at the beginning, and I think he'll admit that. Q Do you believe that there's a climate change issue here in California at all? THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q Is there a climate change issue in California? THE PRESIDENT: Uh, you'll have to ask the governor that question; I don't want to step on his toes. SUPPORTER: Mr. President, no question. Thank you for making America great again, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I like this guy. SUPPORTER: I love you, sir! THE PRESIDENT: I don't know who you are, but I like you.

So we're going to Philadelphia. We're coming back in a little while, but we'll be up there for a short time. We look forward to it. The economic world, having to do with our country, is doing unbelievably well. The numbers are good. And you'll see some very good numbers, I think, released just prior to November 3rd for the third quarter. I think it's going to be , I think they'll be fantastic numbers. Do you have any questions? Q Less than 50 days remain until the presidential election. What are you doing, Mr. President, to reach out to undecided voters? THE PRESIDENT: So with the suburban voter, we're taking care of them. It's safety. It's about safety. It's about law and order. It's also about getting regulations , where housing is forced into a suburban neighborhood. And, you know, that's the American Dream. And, by the way, minorities want that; everybody wants that: They want the American Dream. Because when you think of suburbia, it's about 30 percent , close to 30 percent minority. Some people say more than that. They want their American Dream. They don't want to have it be obliterated. So we've ended the rule , the regulation, as you know. And if Biden got in, he'd put it right back, except to double it up. And they say that Cory Booker would be in charge. He's the one that's pushing it. We're not going to do that. We're not going to destroy suburbia. And just, basically, I think we have a very strong, a very powerful law-and-order campaign. We are endorsed by almost every major police group. Believe it or not, it's not easy for them to do. The Chicago Police just endorsed us. You heard that. New York City , New York's Finest endorsed us. We have Ohio. We have Florida. We have , I mean, we have everybody. And we just want safe streets. We don't want to have a Portland. We don't want to have what happened in Seattle , that we took care of by saying, \"We're going in.\" And they immediately gave up. We don't want to have that. We want to have safety. We don't want to have Chicago, where people get shot and people get killed. We don't want to have that. Those are all Democrat-run cities, and we don't want to have that. Q Mr. President, yesterday, in California, you said, \"I don't think the science knows,\" actually, when it comes to climate change. Can you explain what you mean by that? And, sir, do you believe in climate change? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm a big believer in forest management. If you noticed the gentleman at the table, the professor, he's a big believer in what I said. He came up to me and said, \"Sir, you happen to be right.\" When you let the floors of the forest build up with leaves and build up with broken timber that's dry as a bone, you're causing forest fires. That's a problem. You're causing forest fires. So I believe in a lot of things, but I believe definitely in forest management. Plus, you have to have some breaks. If you don't have breaks in between so that, when you do have areas, you're not going to lose 250,000 acres every time of beautiful forest. So , and I think, frankly, the governor , I get along with him very well. I think the governor agrees with me. Yeah, please. Q Do you think global warming is a hoax or not? Yesterday, you said it will cool down. Does that mean it isn't there? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think you have people that don't want to address China. They don't want to address Russia. They don't want to address India. They don't want to address these countries that haven't done very much for global warming, for the carbon footprint , for any of the things that they talk about. You have a lot of countries that, you know, we're supposed to do it, and we do do it. By the way, our carbon numbers right now are very low. They're really low. Our water, our air , I want it to be clean. I want it to be immaculate. I want it to be crystal. I want it to be absolutely clean, and that's what we're doing. But we, at the same time, don't want to drive our businesses out because they can't compete. If you look at China, with all of the plants they have , you take , just take a look at China, and look at what's coming out of China. Take a look at our oceans and see who is dumping in our oceans. It's not us. It's not us. And I think that's something people should be addressing. Steve. Q Did you see where the WTO had ruled that your tariffs on China were illegal? THE PRESIDENT: What are they going to do? Q The WTO ruled that your tariffs on China are illegal. Did you have a response to that? THE PRESIDENT: Well, then we'll have to do something about the WTO because they've let China get away with murder. They consider China to be a developing nation. And by as a \"developing nation,\" as that , did this just happen, Steve? It just happened? Q Yes. THE PRESIDENT: All right. Well, we'll take a look at that. But I'm not a big fan of the WTO , that, I can tell you right now. Maybe they did us a big favor. Q On TikTok, sir , on TikTok, what do you think of the Oracle deal? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we're going to make a decision pretty soon. I have a high respect for Larry Ellison. He's somebody I know. He's been, really, a terrific guy for a long time. So we're going to take a look. I heard they're very close to a deal, and we'll be looking at the TikTok deal with Larry Ellison and Oracle. Q Mr. President, why do you suppose your former aides , General Mattis, General Kelly , have been reluctant to defend you in any way over the course of the past two weeks? THE PRESIDENT: Because we're very different. And you can see that with the deal we made today. I'm not a big fan of General Mattis, as you know. I think he's a very overrated general. But regardless, he , I guess he's a nice guy. He just didn't do the job for me. He didn't do the ISIS job. After we got rid of him, it worked out very well. We took over 100 percent of the caliphate. But I do things differently. If you , if you listen to the three world leaders today , and these are highly respected leaders and countries. UAE is a , is a tremendously respected warrior. I mean, they're warriors. They're a very strong, respected country. If you listen to what they said, nobody thought of the plan that I thought of. And it's going around the back door; I call it \"going around the smart door and coming in a different way.\" And we have many other countries going to be joining us, and they're going to be joining us soon. We'll have , I can , I mean, I think seven or eight or nine. We're going to have a lot of other countries joining us, including the big ones. We already have the big one, but including the big ones. And this is not something that the people that you mentioned would be able to be doing. And it's not something that my critics thought was possible, and now they say, \"Wow, that was a good idea.\" I will say it's gotten rave reviews, even from the New York Times and Tom Friedman and a lot of people that don't like Donald Trump too much. They've given it, literally, rave reviews. So this is one deal, but we have many others like this. Look, our country has been stagnant for many years. We did nothing but give our money away, give our wealth away, and give our jobs away. And now we stopped that. We stopped that three and a half years ago. Q What about the Saudis? Do you think Saudi Arabia will join? THE PRESIDENT: I do. I spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia. At the right time, I do think they will come in. Yes, I do. This is a , this is a very big and very historic moment, and I think everyone agrees to that. But we'll have other countries coming in fairly rapidly. Q Do you think indoor rallies are safe? THE PRESIDENT: So, I think this: I think you have a governor of Nevada who wouldn't let us use outside venues. You know, the night before , I think you were there , we had a massive crowd, and it was an outside venue. Well, we had other outside venues the next day in Las Vegas. The governor made it impossible for the people that do it , our people, the people that do it , and forced us into an indoor rally. We didn't want an indoor rally, but we did an indoor rally. They spaced as much as they could have, but the governor could have solved the problem. All he had to do was let us use one of the outdoor venues. Plus, they had 25,000 people outside of the venue that couldn't get in. But it's very interesting: When they have protests, that's okay. When they have violence, when they have anarchists and they have agitators, that's okay. The governor of Nevada should not be in charge of ballots. The ballots are going to be a disaster for our country. And the governor of Nevada should not be in charge of ballots. When he won't let us meet and congregate and do, really, a friendly protest, he should not be in charge of the ballots. You're going to have problems with the ballots like nobody has ever seen before.

We spoke today to Walmart, Oracle , I guess, Microsoft is still involved. We'll make a decision. But nothing much has changed. We'll make a decision soon. Q Mr. President, what's your response to Olivia Troye and some of these former administration officials who are coming out to criticize you? You hired them. THE PRESIDENT: I just heard about that. I don't know her. She worked for the Vice President. She was on the task force as some kind of a lower-level person. I have no idea who she is. I don't met her , I never met her, to the best of my knowledge. Maybe she was in a room. I have no idea who she is. She doesn't know me. It's just another person that leaves, and whether it's CNN or Washington Post, they say negative things. We have a letter from her, I was just told, that is absolutely the most beautiful going-away letter. She was terminated. They didn't want her. She was terminated. She has nothing to do with me. I don't know her. I never met her. May have been in a room or something, but I never met her. She , Mike Pence came to me; he told me about her. He said she left. They let her go with cause, but they let her go. And then she wrote a beautiful letter, as I understand it , a letter praising the administration. But then the people get a hold of her and said, \"Let's say some bad things about Donald Trump.\" The same thing with that other young gentleman, Miles. I never met him. I don't know him. He's on your network all the time, CNN. I have no idea who he is. It's a terrible thing. We have a big government. Every time somebody leaves government, 99 percent of the time, I'm not going to know these people. And they leave on a basis of almost like it's a personal thing with me. I have no idea who this person was, but we'll give you a copy of her letter. Q Why are there so many former employees saying negative things? THE PRESIDENT: We'll give you a copy of her letter, and her letter was a beautiful letter, everything wonderful from, I guess, a couple of months ago. I didn't read it, but I heard it was a beautiful letter. General Keith Kellogg, one of the most respected people in the military , he's a great guy; you know him; we all know him , he just went on television excoriating her, saying what a disgrace it is that they're allowed to do it. Anytime somebody leaves our big, massive government, they leave and they try and , they get coerced into saying bad things. And it's very unfortunate. It's a very sad thing. But you know what? Q She said all you care about is reelection. Is that true? THE PRESIDENT: Here's the bottom line: We've done more than any President in the first three and a half years. Nobody has done what we've done. Nobody has accomplished what we've accomplished. We will very soon have peace in the Middle East, if you can believe that one. We're going to have peace in the Middle East. We have five other nations that want to sign like almost immediately. You'll end up with peace in the Middle East.

{"SpeechID":"VSDT1792020387","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-09-17","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump at the White House Conference on American History","Type":"speech","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike. A great Vice President. I am truly honored to be here at the very first White House Conference on American History. So important. Our mission is to defend the legacy of America's founding, the virtue of America's heroes, and the nobility of the American character. We must clear away the twisted web of lies in our schools and classrooms, and teach our children the magnificent truth about our country. We want our sons and daughters to know that they are the citizens of the most exceptional nation in the history of the world. (Applause.) To grow up in America is to live in a land where anything is possible, where anyone can rise, and where any dream can come true , all because of the immortal principles our nation's founders inscribed nearly two and a half centuries ago. That's why we have come to the National Archives, the sacred home of our national memory. In this great chamber, we preserve our glorious inheritance: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights. On this very day in 1787, our Founding Fathers signed the Constitution at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. It was the fulfillment of a thousand years of Western civilization. Our Constitution was the product of centuries of tradition, wisdom, and experience. No political document has done more to advance the human condition or propel the engine of progress. Yet, as we gather this afternoon, a radical movement is attempting to demolish this treasured and precious inheritance. We can't let that happen. (Applause.) Left-wing mobs have torn down statues of our founders, desecrated our memorials, and carried out a campaign of violence and anarchy. Far-left demonstrators have chanted the words \"America was never great.\" The left has launched a vicious and violent assault on law enforcement , the universal symbol of the rule of law in America. These radicals have been aided and abetted by liberal politicians, establishment media, and even large corporations. Whether it is the mob on the street, or the cancel culture in the boardroom, the goal is the same: to silence dissent, to scare you out of speaking the truth, and to bully Americans into abandoning their values, their heritage, and their very way of life. We are here today to declare that we will never submit to tyranny. We will reclaim our history and our country for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. The radicals burning American flags want to burn down the principles enshrined in our founding documents, including the bedrock principle of equal justice under law. In order to radically transform America, they must first cause Americans to lose confidence in who we are, where we came from, and what we believe. As I said at Mount Rushmore , which they would love to rip down and it rip it down fast, and that's never going to happen , two months ago, the left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution. As many of you testified today, the left-wing rioting and mayhem are the direct result of decades of left-wing indoctrination in our schools. It's gone on far too long. Our children are instructed from propaganda tracts, like those of Howard Zinn, that try to make students ashamed of their own history. The left has warped, distorted, and defiled the American story with deceptions, falsehoods, and lies. There is no better example than the New York Times' totally discredited 1619 Project. This project rewrites American history to teach our children that we were founded on the principle of oppression, not freedom. Nothing could be further from the truth. America's founding set in motion the unstoppable chain of events that abolished slavery, secured civil rights, defeated communism and fascism, and built the most fair, equal, and prosperous nation in human history. (Applause.) The narratives about America being pushed by the far-left and being chanted in the streets bear a striking resemblance to the anti-American propaganda of our adversaries , because both groups want to see America weakened, derided, and totally diminished. Students in our universities are inundated with critical race theory. This is a Marxist doctrine holding that America is a wicked and racist nation, that even young children are complicit in oppression, and that our entire society must be radically transformed. Critical race theory is being forced into our children's schools, it's being imposed into workplace trainings, and it's being deployed to rip apart friends, neighbors, and families. A perfect example of critical race theory was recently published by the Smithsonian Institution. This document alleged that concepts such as hard work, rational thinking, the nuclear family, and belief in God were not values that unite all Americans, but were instead aspects of \"whiteness.\" This is offensive and outrageous to Americans of every ethnicity, and it is especially harmful to children of minority backgrounds who should be uplifted, not disparaged. Teaching this horrible doctrine to our children is a form of child abuse in the truest sense of those words. For many years now, the radicals have mistaken Americans' silence for weakness. But they're wrong. There is no more powerful force than a parent's love for their children. And patriotic moms and dads are going to demand that their children are no longer fed hateful lies about this country. American parents are not going to accept indoctrination in our schools, cancel culture at our work, or the repression of traditional faith, culture, and values in the public square. Not anymore. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. We embrace the vision of Martin Luther King, where children are not judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. The left is attempting to destroy that beautiful vision and divide Americans by race in the service of political power. By viewing every issue through the lens of race, they want to impose a new segregation, and we must not allow that to happen. Critical race theory, the 1619 Project, and the crusade against American history is toxic propaganda, ideological poison that, if not removed, will dissolve the civic bonds that tie us together. It will destroy our country. That is why I recently banned trainings in this prejudiced ideology from the federal government and banned it in the strongest manner possible. (Applause.) The only path to national unity is through our shared identity as Americans. That is why it is so urgent that we finally restore patriotic education to our schools. Under our leadership, the National Endowment for the Humanities has awarded a grant to support the development of a pro-American curriculum that celebrates the truth about our nation's great history. (Applause.) We are joined by some of the respected scholars involved in this project, including Professor Wilfred McClay. Wilfred, please. Thank you very much. Welcome. (Applause.) Thank you. Dr. Peter Wood of the National Association of Scholars. Dr. Peter. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. And Ted Rebarber. Thank you, Ted. (Applause.) Thank you very much, Ted. Today, I am also pleased to announce that I will soon sign an Executive Order establishing a national commission to promote patriotic education. It will be called the \"1776 Commission.\" (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. It will encourage our educators to teach our children about the miracle of American history and make plans to honor the 250th anniversary of our founding. Think of that , 250 years. Recently, I also signed an executive order to establish the National Garden of American Heroes, a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans who have ever lived. Today, I am announcing a new name for inclusion.One of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence was a patriot from Delaware. In July of 1776, the Continental Congress was deadlocked during the debate over independence. The delegation from Delaware was divided. Caesar Rodney was called upon to break the tie. Even though he was suffering from very advanced cancer , he was deathly ill , Rodney rode 80 miles through the night, through a severe thunderstorm, from Dover to Philadelphia to cast his vote for independence. For nearly a century, a statue of one of Delaware's most beloved citizens stood in Rodney Square, right in the heart of Wilmington. But this past June, Caesar Rodney's statue was ordered removed by the mayor and local politicians as part of a radical purge of America's founding generation. Today, because of an order I signed, if you demolish a statue without permission, you immediately get 10 years in prison. (Applause.) And there have been no statues demolished for the last four months, incredibly, since the time I signed that act. Joe Biden said nothing as to his home state's history and the fact that it was dismantled and dismembered. And a Founding Father's statue was removed. Today, America will give this Founding Father, this very brave man, who was so horribly treated, the place of honor he deserves. I am announcing that a statue of Caesar Rodney will be added to the National Garden of American Heroes. (Applause.) From Washington to Lincoln, from Jefferson to King, America has been home to some of the most incredible people who have ever lived. With the help of everyone here today, the legacy of 1776 will never be erased. Our heroes will never be forgotten. Our youth will be taught to love America with all of their heart and all of their soul. We will save this cherished inheritance for our children, for their children, and for every generation to come. This is a very important day. Thank you all once again for being here. Now I will sign the Constitution Day Proclamation. God Bless You. And God Bless America. Thank you very much. (Applause.)

We have a packed place, and it's going to be, I think, very exciting, as it was last night in Minnesota. That was an incredible event. We have some very big news on TikTok. TikTok is moving along. We're dealing with Oracle, which you know of. Larry Ellison. And we're dealing with, as a combination, Walmart , Walmart, a great company. A great American company. The security will be 100 percent. They'll be using separate clouds and a lot of very, very powerful security. And they'll be making about a 5-billion-dollar contribution toward education. We're going to be setting up a very large fund toward the education of American youth. And that'll be great. That's their contribution that I've been asking for. But we'll see whether or not it all happens. But, conceptually, I think it's a great deal for America. They'll be hiring at least 25,000 people. It'll most likely be incorporated in Texas. It'll be a brand-new company. It will have nothing to do with any outside land, any outside country. It will have nothing to do with China. It'll be totally secure. That'll be part of the deal, and that will be both Oracle, as you know, and Walmart. And I think it's going to be a fantastic deal. The technology is superior to anything in the world, and we like that. And, again, a lot of jobs, a lot of money. A lot of money for our country. Billions of dollars of taxes will be paid every year. And hundreds of millions of users, and they'll be happy. So everybody will be happy. It's a severance. It'll continue to be named TikTok, as it was all along. And that's it. That's it. So I can say that I have given the deal my blessing. If they get it done, that's great. If they don't, that's okay too. But it's a great deal for America, and very interesting. Q Have you approved the deal? THE PRESIDENT: I approved the deal in concept, yes. Q Sir, do you want to see a nominee on your Supreme Court choice before the election? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we'll see what happens. We'll be talking to people soon. We have great respect for the process. This has happened numerous times. And every time, there was a nominee, as you know. There's been many occasions where, frankly, it turned out to be during a presidential year. I think I heard 28, but whatever it may be. But in all cases, they went forward. But we want to respect the process, and the process will move. I think it's going to move very quickly, actually. I agree with the statement put out by Mitch McConnell. I agree with it, actually, 100 percent. I put out a very similar statement you saw. So I think we're going to start the process extremely soon, and we'll have a nominee very soon. Q Will ByteDance keep a minority stake in TikTok? THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q Will ByteDance keep a minority stake? THE PRESIDENT: Well, they're going to report the full scope of the deal very soon. Very soon. But it'll be totally controlled by Oracle and Walmart. All of the control is Walmart and Oracle, two great American companies. And you have the combination of the Walmart , that's obvious , and the high-tech of Oracle and the genius of the two leaders of those companies. Okay? Q Sir, Senator Collins said she'd like to see the next President be the one to nominate a Supreme Court justice. What's your reaction to that? THE PRESIDENT: Who said that? Q Senator Collins. Susan Collins. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I totally disagree with her. We have an obligation. We won. And we have an obligation, as the winners, to pick who we want. That's not the next President. Hopefully, I'll be the next President. But we're here now. Right now, we're here. And we have an obligation to the voters, all of the people , the millions of people that put us here in the form of a victory. We have an obligation to them, to all of those voters. And it's a very simple thing. So I would disagree. If that's what she said , that's not the way I read it. I read it differently. But if that's what she said, I totally disagree. Q How many people are on your short list? Do you have a short list? THE PRESIDENT: I do. I have a short list. I've had a short list for a while. We added a number of people onto the list , the previous list. We have about 45 altogether. I do indeed have a short list. I've gotten to know , I've gotten to know many of them. I think it's probably, from a legal standpoint, from a sophisticated understanding of the law, from a constitutional standpoint, I think it's the greatest list ever assembled. And I think that the other side should show their radical-left list, and I think you'll be surprised. Q What do you think of Amy Coney Barrett? A lot of people think she's the frontrunner. THE PRESIDENT: Well, she's very highly respected. I can say that. Q Would you like your nominee to be a woman? THE PRESIDENT: I could see, most likely, it would be a woman, yeah. I think I can say that it would be a woman. I would , if somebody were to ask me now, I would say that a woman would be in first place, yes. The choice of a woman, I would say, would certainly be appropriate. Q What about Barbara Lagoa? THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q Barbara Lagoa. THE PRESIDENT: She's an extraordinary person. I've heard incredible things about her. I don't know her. She's Hispanic and highly respected. Miami. Highly respected. Q Sir, President Obama's pick in 2016, Merrick Garland, didn't get a chance to move forward. That was an election year. Why should your pick get a chance to move forward in an election year? THE PRESIDENT: Well, that's called \"the consequences of losing an election.\" He lost the election. He didn't have the votes. When you lose elections, sometimes things don't work out well. Q But that was before the election. THE PRESIDENT: And, by the way, I have to say this: Judge Garland is highly respected. I have a lot of respect for him. I do. I have a lot of respect for him. But it's the consequences of an election. Q Do you expect a vote before the election or after the election? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don't know. We're working with all of the Republican senators and working with Mitch McConnell. And we'll be making a decision. I would think before would be very good, but we'll be making a decision. I think the process can go very, very fast. I'll be making my choice soon. And when the choice is made, I'll be sending it over to Mitch in the Senate. And they will do what they have to do. I think we'll have a very popular choice, whoever it may be. But we'll be sending it over to the Senate, okay? Q Do you think that choice will be next week? THE PRESIDENT: I think the choice will be next week, yes. I do. I do. Okay? So we'll see you , some of you , in North Carolina. Okay? Thank you very much.

Therapeutics are coming along very well. And we'll see what happens. But too bad about Europe. Too bad. Q Is there a chance you would announce your Supreme Court pick before Friday? THE PRESIDENT: I would say on Friday or Saturday I'll be announcing the pick. It's , five women are being looked at and vetted very carefully. Five. And we'll make a decision probably Saturday, but Friday or Saturday. Q Do you plan to meet with any of them in person? Do you plan to meet with any of them in person before you make your decision? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I will. Q When are you going to do that? THE PRESIDENT: During this period of time. Q Do you think all five? THE PRESIDENT: I don't know. I doubt it. I doubt it. Q But in person?

On the phone? THE PRESIDENT: Today and yesterday, the day before. Q Is it better to have a vote on your nominee before the election or after? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'd much rather have a vote before the election because there's a lot of work to be done, and I'd much rather have it. And we have plenty of time to do it. I mean, there's really a lot of time. So let's say I make the announcement on Saturday , there's a great deal of time before the election. That'll be up to Mitch in the Senate. But I'd certainly much rather have the vote. I think it sends a good signal. And it's solidarity and lots of other things. And I'm just doing my constitutional obligation. I have an obligation to do this. So I would rather see it before the election. Q Are you worried about some senators , Republican senators who may be a little reluctant? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we'll have to see. I would think that that would be very bad for them. I think their voters , the people that voted them put them there because of a certain ideology or certain feel. And they don't want to have somebody do that. I think it's very bad if they do that. Q What makes you think that the last words , supposedly the last wishes of Justice Ginsburg were made up? Because it supposedly came from her granddaughter, not from one of the Democrats. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, it just sounds to me like it would be somebody else. I don't believe , it could be. It could be. And it might not be, too. Just too , it was just too convenient. Q What would be your concern if the vote happened after Election Day? THE PRESIDENT: No concern. I just think it would be better. They asked, \"Would I rather have it \" I'd rather have it before the election. I think it would be better for our country. And we , we'll pick somebody that's outstanding, very qualified. They're all qualified, but somebody that is outstanding. And I'd rather see it all take place before the election, so before November 3rd. Q Are you concerned if you lost the election, it would be harder to get the person confirmed? THE PRESIDENT: No, I don't think so. No. I think we're going to win. If you look at the polls , the real polls , we're doing very well. We're going to Ohio tonight, and we're packed. We're packed everywhere. So people , there's never been , we've never had spirit like we have now. Even four years ago, the spirit now is greater even than it was four years ago. Q What will be your message tomorrow to the U.N.? And did you just tape it? THE PRESIDENT: I did. I just taped , I just did it just now. My message is a strong message on China, and basically , you'll see it. You'll see it tomorrow. But I just did it a little while ago. Q Are you leaning toward one candidate over another? Are you leaning toward , THE PRESIDENT: I have one or two that I think are , they're all outstanding, but I have one or two that I have in mind, yeah. Q Who do you think poisoned Alexei Navalny? THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q Who do you think poisoned Alexei Navalny in Russia? THE PRESIDENT: We'll talk about that at another time. Q Is Amy Coney Barrett one of the leading contenders, in your mind? THE PRESIDENT: She's one of the people that's very respected, but they're all respected. She is certainly one of the candidates, yes. Q When you go down to Miami, will you meet with Barbara Lagoa? THE PRESIDENT: I may. She's highly thought of and has got a lot of support. You know, a lot of people , I'm getting a lot of phone calls from a lot of people. She has a lot of support. I don't know her, but I hear she's outstanding. And she's one of the people we're looking at. Q Did you push the DOJ to name Seattle and New York and Portland \"anarchistic cities\"? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think they are. But that's up to DOJ. That'll be up to , that will be up to the Attorney General. But certainly they are. If you look at Portland, if you look at what's going on there, what a mess. Go ahead. And we can straighten it out , all Democrats. All radical left. We could straighten it out so fast. Go ahead. Q When will you make a final decision on TikTok? THE PRESIDENT: That's working its way through. I've given a preliminary okay. They will work , they're two great companies , Oracle and Walmart. Larry Ellison is a , you know, a great genius at that kind of thing. The technology is incredible. And so if we can save it, we'll save it. And if we can't, we'll cut it off. But they have preliminary. We'll see what they can do. We have to have total security. That's the only thing , very important. We have to have total security. I'll see you in Ohio. Thank you.

My Administration will never allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon, nor will we allow Iran to endanger the rest of the world with a fresh supply of ballistic missiles and conventional arms. To ensure this cannot happen, I am issuing a new Executive Order, restoring United Nations (UN) sanctions on Iran, and imposing new sanctions and export controls on more than two dozen entities and individuals that support Iran's nuclear, missile, and conventional arms-related activities. The Executive Order I am issuing today blocks the property, and interests in property, in the United States of those who contribute to the supply, sale, or transfer of conventional arms to or from Iran, as well as those who provide technical training, financial support and services, and other assistance related to these arms. This Executive Order is critical to enforcing the UN arms embargo on Iran. The order will greatly diminish the Iranian regime's capacity to export arms to terrorists and dangerous actors throughout the region, as well as its ability to acquire weapons to build up its own forces. Today, my Administration is also imposing new sanctions and export control measures on 27 entities and individuals connected to Iran's proliferation networks. These actions target the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran for its role in Iran's nuclear escalation, the Iranian missile organization Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group for facilitating ballistic missile development, and two Iranian entities for their involvement in the transfer and acquisition of conventional arms. The United States has now restored UN sanctions on Iran. The Iranian regime has repeatedly lied about its secret nuclear weapons archive and denied access to international inspectors, further exposing the deep flaws of the last administration's failed nuclear deal from which I withdrew the United States. The world cannot afford to sit idly by as Iran builds a nuclear weapon. My Administration is restoring these sanctions as part of our efforts to ensure that never happens. My actions today send a clear message to the Iranian regime and those in the international community who refuse to stand up to Iran. The United States will not allow the Iranian regime to further advance capabilities to directly threaten and terrorize the rest of the world. My Administration will use every tool at our disposal to stop Iran's nuclear, ballistic missile, and conventional weapons pursuits.

Seventy-five years after the end of World War II and the founding of the United Nations, we are once again engaged in a great global struggle. We have waged a fierce battle against the invisible enemy , the China virus , which has claimed countless lives in 188 countries. In the United States, we launched the most aggressive mobilization since the Second World War. We rapidly produced a record supply of ventilators, creating a surplus that allowed us to share them with friends and partners all around the globe. We pioneered life-saving treatments, reducing our fatality rate 85 percent since April. Thanks to our efforts, three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials. We are mass-producing them in advance so they can be delivered immediately upon arrival. We will distribute a vaccine, we will defeat the virus, we will end the pandemic, and we will enter a new era of unprecedented prosperity, cooperation, and peace. As we pursue this bright future, we must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world: China. In the earliest days of the virus, China locked down travel domestically while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world. China condemned my travel ban on their country, even as they cancelled domestic flights and locked citizens in their homes. The Chinese government and the World Health Organization , which is virtually controlled by China , falsely declared that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Later, they falsely said people without symptoms would not spread the disease. The United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions. In addition, every year, China dumps millions and millions of tons of plastic and trash into the oceans, overfishes other countries' waters, destroys vast swaths of coral reef, and emits more toxic mercury into the atmosphere than any country anywhere in the world. China's carbon emissions are nearly twice what the U.S. has, and it's rising fast. By contrast, after I withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord, last year America reduced its carbon emissions by more than any country in the agreement. Those who attack America's exceptional environmental record while ignoring China's rampant pollution are not interested in the environment. They only want to punish America, and I will not stand for it. If the United Nations is to be an effective organization, it must focus on the real problems of the world. This includes terrorism, the oppression of women, forced labor, drug trafficking, human and sex trafficking, religious persecution, and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities. America will always be a leader in human rights. My administration is advancing religious liberty, opportunity for women, the decriminalization of homosexuality, combatting human trafficking, and protecting unborn children. We also know that American prosperity is the bedrock of freedom and security all over the world. In three short years, we built the greatest economy in history, and we are quickly doing it again. Our military has increased substantially in size. We spent $2.5 trillion over the last four years on our military. We have the most powerful military anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. We stood up to decades of China's trade abuses. We revitalized the NATO Alliance, where other countries are now paying a much more fair share. We forged historic partnerships with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to stop human smuggling. We are standing with the people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom. We withdrew from the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal and imposed crippling sanctions on the world's leading state sponsor of terror. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100 percent; killed its founder and leader, al-Baghdadi; and eliminated the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. This month, we achieved a peace deal between Serbia and Kosovo. We reached a landmark breakthrough with two peace deals in the Middle East, after decades of no progress. Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain all signed a historic peace agreement in the White House, with many other Middle Eastern countries to come. They are coming fast, and they know it's great for them and it's great for the world. These groundbreaking peace deals are the dawn of the new Middle East. By taking a different approach, we have achieved different outcomes , far superior outcomes. We took an approach, and the approach worked. We intend to deliver more peace agreements shortly, and I have never been more optimistic for the future of the region. There is no blood in the sand. Those days are, hopefully, over. As we speak, the United States is also working to end the war in Afghanistan, and we are bringing our troops home. America is fulfilling our destiny as peacemaker, but it is peace through strength. We are stronger now than ever before. Our weapons are at an advanced level like we've never had before , like, frankly, we've never even thought of having before. And I only pray to God that we never have to use them. For decades, the same tired voices proposed the same failed solutions, pursuing global ambitions at the expense of their own people. But only when you take care of your own citizens will you find a true basis for cooperation. As President, I have rejected the failed approaches of the past, and I am proudly putting America first, just as you should be putting your countries first. That's okay , that's what you should be doing. I am supremely confident that next year, when we gather in person, we will be in the midst of one of the greatest years in our history , and frankly, hopefully, in the history of the world. Thank you. God bless you all. God bless America. And God bless the United Nations.

We also know that American prosperity is the bedrock of freedom and security all over the world. In three short years, we built the greatest economy in history, and we are quickly doing it again. Our military has increased substantially in size. We spent $2.5 trillion over the last four years on our military. We have the most powerful military anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. We stood up to decades of China's trade abuses. We revitalized the NATO Alliance, where other countries are now paying a much more fair share. We forged historic partnerships with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to stop human smuggling. We are standing with the people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom. We withdrew from the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal and imposed crippling sanctions on the world's leading state sponsor of terror. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100 percent; killed its founder and leader, al-Baghdadi; and eliminated the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. This month, we achieved a peace deal between Serbia and Kosovo. We reached a landmark breakthrough with two peace deals in the Middle East, after decades of no progress. Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain all signed a historic peace agreement in the White House, with many other Middle Eastern countries to come. They are coming fast, and they know it's great for them and it's great for the world. These groundbreaking peace deals are the dawn of the new Middle East. By taking a different approach, we have achieved different outcomes , far superior outcomes. We took an approach, and the approach worked. We intend to deliver more peace agreements shortly, and I have never been more optimistic for the future of the region. There is no blood in the sand. Those days are, hopefully, over. As we speak, the United States is also working to end the war in Afghanistan, and we are bringing our troops home. America is fulfilling our destiny as peacemaker, but it is peace through strength. We are stronger now than ever before. Our weapons are at an advanced level like we've never had before , like, frankly, we've never even thought of having before. And I only pray to God that we never have to use them. For decades, the same tired voices proposed the same failed solutions, pursuing global ambitions at the expense of their own people. But only when you take care of your own citizens will you find a true basis for cooperation. As President, I have rejected the failed approaches of the past, and I am proudly putting America first, just as you should be putting your countries first. That's okay , that's what you should be doing. I am supremely confident that next year, when we gather in person, we will be in the midst of one of the greatest years in our history , and frankly, hopefully, in the history of the world. Thank you. God bless you all. God bless America. And God bless the United Nations."}

People like the job we're doing, and I think we're going to have a very successful day. Do you have any questions, please? Q Have you made up your mind on the Supreme Court or how close to it , THE PRESIDENT: I'm getting very close to having a final decision made. Very close. Q Are you going to meet with , THE PRESIDENT: I'm going to make it, I believe, at 5 o'clock on Saturday. I'll be having a conference. Q How many people have you interviewed? How many interviews? THE PRESIDENT: I've talked to many people , many people. Q Why haven't you said anything about the U.S. hitting , why haven't you said anything about the U.S. hitting 200,000 deaths from COVID? THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q Why haven't you said anything about the U.S. hitting 200,000 deaths from COVID? THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. Anybody else? Q Mr. President, could you speak to the grim milestone today of 200,000 deaths to the virus? What do you want to say to the American people? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it's a shame. I think if we didn't do it properly and do it right, you'd have two and a half million deaths. If you take a look at alternatives, you could have two and a half million deaths or something thereabouts. You could have a number that would be substantially more. With all of that being said, we shouldn't have had anybody. And you saw my United Nations speech. China should've stopped it at their border. They should've never let this spread all over the world, and it's a terrible thing. But had we not closed our country down and reopened , and now we're doing well in reopening; the stock market is up , all of those things. But I think it's a horrible thing. But if we had not done it right, you could have two million, two and a half million, or three million. But it's a horrible thing. It should've never, ever happened. China let this happen, and just remember that. Q Do you think that we could hit another 200,000-death milestone? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I know this: The original numbers were around 200,000, if you do it right, if you did a good job, and if the public worked along. And if you didn't do it right, you'd be a at two million, two and a half million. Those were the numbers. But this should've never happened. This should've never come out of China. They should've never let it happen. So that's it. Q Are you going to meet with Barbara Lagoa this week on Friday? Or when? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don't want to talk about who I'm meeting with, but I've spoken to many, and we're getting close to a decision. We're going to be doing it on Saturday. We're going to be meeting on Saturday. A lot of paperwork to do. And I think it's going to go very quickly. Q And then one of the things that the Democrats are saying is that, if you go ahead with this, it could tear the country apart. What's your reaction to that? THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I don't think so. I , we need nine justices. You need that. With the unsolicited millions of ballots that they're sending, it's a scam; it's a hoax. Everybody knows that. And the Democrats know it better than anybody else. So you're going to need nine justices up there. I think it's going to be very important. Because what they're doing is a hoax, with the ballots. They're sending out tens of millions of ballots, unsolicited , not where they're being asked, but unsolicited. And that's a hoax, and you're going to need to have nine justices. So doing it before the election would be a very good thing because you're going to probably see it, because what they're doing is trying to sow confusion and everything else. And, you know, when they talk about Russia, China, and all these others, they will be able to do something here because paper ballots are very simple , whether they counterfeit them, forge them, do whatever you want. It's a very serious problem. And the Democrats know what they're doing is wrong, and all they want to do is go forward with it. So I think you're going to need the nine justices. Also, I have a constitutional obligation to put in nine judges , justices. So I think you're going to be very impressed when you see , all of them. I mean, they're all great. These are all very talented people, and I think you'll be very impressed by the person chosen. Okay?

{"SpeechID":"VSDT229202076","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-09-22","SpeechTitle":"Executive Order on Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping","Type":"statement","RawText":"By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq., and in order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal contracting, to promote unity in the Federal workforce, and to combat offensive and anti-American race and sex stereotyping and scapegoating, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. From the battlefield of Gettysburg to the bus boycott in Montgomery and the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, heroic Americans have valiantly risked their lives to ensure that their children would grow up in a Nation living out its creed, expressed in the Declaration of Independence: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\" It was this belief in the inherent equality of every individual that inspired the Founding generation to risk their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to establish a new Nation, unique among the countries of the world. President Abraham Lincoln understood that this belief is \"the electric cord\" that \"links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving\" people, no matter their race or country of origin. It is the belief that inspired the heroic black soldiers of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment to defend that same Union at great cost in the Civil War. And it is what inspired Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to dream that his children would one day \"not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\" Thanks to the courage and sacrifice of our forebears, America has made significant progress toward realization of our national creed, particularly in the 57 years since Dr. King shared his dream with the country. Today, however, many people are pushing a different vision of America that is grounded in hierarchies based on collective social and political identities rather than in the inherent and equal dignity of every person as an individual. This ideology is rooted in the pernicious and false belief that America is an irredeemably racist and sexist country; that some people, simply on account of their race or sex, are oppressors; and that racial and sexual identities are more important than our common status as human beings and Americans. This destructive ideology is grounded in misrepresentations of our country's history and its role in the world. Although presented as new and revolutionary, they resurrect the discredited notions of the nineteenth century's apologists for slavery who, like President Lincoln's rival Stephen A. Douglas, maintained that our government \"was made on the white basis\" \"by white men, for the benefit of white men.\" Our Founding documents rejected these racialized views of America, which were soundly defeated on the blood-stained battlefields of the Civil War. Yet they are now being repackaged and sold as cutting-edge insights. They are designed to divide us and to prevent us from uniting as one people in pursuit of one common destiny for our great country. Unfortunately, this malign ideology is now migrating from the fringes of American society and threatens to infect core institutions of our country. Instructors and materials teaching that men and members of certain races, as well as our most venerable institutions, are inherently sexist and racist are appearing in workplace diversity trainings across the country, even in components of the Federal Government and among Federal contractors. For example, the Department of the Treasury recently held a seminar that promoted arguments that \"virtually all White people, regardless of how \"woke' they are, contribute to racism,\" and that instructed small group leaders to encourage employees to avoid \"narratives\" that Americans should \"be more color-blind\" or \"let people's skills and personalities be what differentiates them.\" Training materials from Argonne National Laboratories, a Federal entity, stated that racism \"is interwoven into every fabric of America\" and described statements like \"color blindness\" and the \"meritocracy\" as \"actions of bias.\" Materials from Sandia National Laboratories, also a Federal entity, for non-minority males stated that an emphasis on \"rationality over emotionality\" was a characteristic of \"white male[s],\" and asked those present to \"acknowledge\" their \"privilege\" to each other. A Smithsonian Institution museum graphic recently claimed that concepts like \"[o]bjective, rational linear thinking,\" \"[h]ard work\" being \"the key to success,\" the \"nuclear family,\" and belief in a single god are not values that unite Americans of all races but are instead \"aspects and assumptions of whiteness.\" The museum also stated that \"[f]acing your whiteness is hard and can result in feelings of guilt, sadness, confusion, defensiveness, or fear.\" All of this is contrary to the fundamental premises underpinning our Republic: that all individuals are created equal and should be allowed an equal opportunity under the law to pursue happiness and prosper based on individual merit. Executive departments and agencies (agencies), our Uniformed Services, Federal contractors, and Federal grant recipients should, of course, continue to foster environments devoid of hostility grounded in race, sex, and other federally protected characteristics. Training employees to create an inclusive workplace is appropriate and beneficial. The Federal Government is, and must always be, committed to the fair and equal treatment of all individuals before the law. But training like that discussed above perpetuates racial stereotypes and division and can use subtle coercive pressure to ensure conformity of viewpoint. Such ideas may be fashionable in the academy, but they have no place in programs and activities supported by Federal taxpayer dollars. Research also suggests that blame-focused diversity training reinforces biases and decreases opportunities for minorities. Our Federal civil service system is based on merit principles. These principles, codified at 5 U.S.C. 2301, call for all employees to \"receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management without regard to\" race or sex \"and with proper regard for their . . . constitutional rights.\" Instructing Federal employees that treating individuals on the basis of individual merit is racist or sexist directly undermines our Merit System Principles and impairs the efficiency of the Federal service. Similarly, our Uniformed Services should not teach our heroic men and women in uniform the lie that the country for which they are willing to die is fundamentally racist. Such teachings could directly threaten the cohesion and effectiveness of our Uniformed Services. Such activities also promote division and inefficiency when carried out by Federal contractors. The Federal Government has long prohibited Federal contractors from engaging in race or sex discrimination and required contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that such discrimination does not occur. The participation of contractors' employees in training that promotes race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating similarly undermines efficiency in Federal contracting. Such requirements promote divisiveness in the workplace and distract from the pursuit of excellence and collaborative achievements in public administration. Therefore, it shall be the policy of the United States not to promote race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating in the Federal workforce or in the Uniformed Services, and not to allow grant funds to be used for these purposes. In addition, Federal contractors will not be permitted to inculcate such views in their employees. Sec. 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this order, the phrase: (a) \"Divisive concepts\" means the concepts that (1) one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex; (2) the United States is fundamentally racist or sexist; (3) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; (4) an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex; (5) members of one race or sex cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race or sex; (6) an individual's moral character is necessarily determined by his or her race or sex; (7) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex; (8) any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex; or (9) meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race to oppress another race. The term \"divisive concepts\" also includes any other form of race or sex stereotyping or any other form of race or sex scapegoating. (b) \"Race or sex stereotyping\" means ascribing character traits, values, moral and ethical codes, privileges, status, or beliefs to a race or sex, or to an individual because of his or her race or sex. (c) \"Race or sex scapegoating\" means assigning fault, blame, or bias to a race or sex, or to members of a race or sex because of their race or sex. It similarly encompasses any claim that, consciously or unconsciously, and by virtue of his or her race or sex, members of any race are inherently racist or are inherently inclined to oppress others, or that members of a sex are inherently sexist or inclined to oppress others. (d) \"Senior political appointee\" means an individual appointed by the President, or a non-career member of the Senior Executive Service (or agency-equivalent system). Sec. 3. Requirements for the United States Uniformed Services. The United States Uniformed Services, including the United States Armed Forces, shall not teach, instruct, or train any member of the United States Uniformed Services, whether serving on active duty, serving on reserve duty, attending a military service academy, or attending courses conducted by a military department pursuant to a Reserve Officer Corps Training program, to believe any of the divisive concepts set forth in section 2(a) of this order. No member of the United States Uniformed Services shall face any penalty or discrimination on account of his or her refusal to support, believe, endorse, embrace, confess, act upon, or otherwise assent to these concepts. Sec. 4. Requirements for Government Contractors. (a) Except in contracts exempted in the manner provided by section 204 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965 (Equal Employment Opportunity), as amended, all Government contracting agencies shall include in every Government contract hereafter entered into the following provisions: \"During the performance of this contract, the contractor agrees as follows: 1. The contractor shall not use any workplace training that inculcates in its employees any form of race or sex stereotyping or any form of race or sex scapegoating, including the concepts that (a) one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex; (b) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; (c) an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex; (d) members of one race or sex cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race or sex; (e) an individual's moral character is necessarily determined by his or her race or sex; (f) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex; (g) any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex; or (h) meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race to oppress another race. The term \"race or sex stereotyping\" means ascribing character traits, values, moral and ethical codes, privileges, status, or beliefs to a race or sex, or to an individual because of his or her race or sex, and the term \"race or sex scapegoating\" means assigning fault, blame, or bias to a race or sex, or to members of a race or sex because of their race or sex. 2. The contractor will send to each labor union or representative of workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice, to be provided by the agency contracting officer, advising the labor union or workers' representative of the contractor's commitments under the Executive Order of September 22, 2020, entitled Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping, and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment. 3. In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (4), or with any rules, regulations, or orders that may be promulgated in accordance with the Executive Order of September 22, 2020, this contract may be canceled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in Executive Order 11246, and such other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided by any rules, regulations, or orders the Secretary of Labor has issued or adopted pursuant to Executive Order 11246, including subpart D of that order. 4. The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (4) in every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance: Provided, however, that in the event the contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of such direction, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.\" (b) The Department of Labor is directed, through the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), to establish a hotline and investigate complaints received under both this order as well as Executive Order 11246 alleging that a Federal contractor is utilizing such training programs in violation of the contractor's obligations under those orders. The Department shall take appropriate enforcement action and provide remedial relief, as appropriate. (c) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of OFCCP shall publish in the Federal Register a request for information seeking information from Federal contractors, Federal subcontractors, and employees of Federal contractors and subcontractors regarding the training, workshops, or similar programming provided to employees. The request for information should request copies of any training, workshop, or similar programing having to do with diversity and inclusion as well as information about the duration, frequency, and expense of such activities. Sec. 5. Requirements for Federal Grants. The heads of all agencies shall review their respective grant programs and identify programs for which the agency may, as a condition of receiving such a grant, require the recipient to certify that it will not use Federal funds to promote the concepts that (a) one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex; (b) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; (c) an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex; (d) members of one race or sex cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race or sex; (e) an individual's moral character is necessarily determined by his or her race or sex; (f) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex; (g) any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex; or (h) meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race to oppress another race. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the heads of agencies shall each submit a report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that lists all grant programs so identified. Sec. 6. Requirements for Agencies. (a) The fair and equal treatment of individuals is an inviolable principle that must be maintained in the Federal workplace. Agencies should continue all training that will foster a workplace that is respectful of all employees. Accordingly: (i) The head of each agency shall use his or her authority under 5 U.S.C. 301, 302, and 4103 to ensure that the agency, agency employees while on duty status, and any contractors hired by the agency to provide training, workshops, forums, or similar programming (for purposes of this section, \"training\") to agency employees do not teach, advocate, act upon, or promote in any training to agency employees any of the divisive concepts listed in section 2(a) of this order. Agencies may consult with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 4116, in carrying out this provision; and(ii) Agency diversity and inclusion efforts shall, first and foremost, encourage agency employees not to judge each other by their color, race, ethnicity, sex, or any other characteristic protected by Federal law. (b) The Director of OPM shall propose regulations providing that agency officials with supervisory authority over a supervisor or an employee with responsibility for promoting diversity and inclusion, if such supervisor or employee either authorizes or approves training that promotes the divisive concepts set forth in section 2(a) of this order, shall take appropriate steps to pursue a performance-based adverse action proceeding against such supervisor or employee under chapter 43 or 75 of title 5, United States Code. (c) Each agency head shall: (i) issue an order incorporating the requirements of this order into agency operations, including by making compliance with this order a provision in all agency contracts for diversity training; (ii) request that the agency inspector general thoroughly review and assess by the end of the calendar year, and not less than annually thereafter, agency compliance with the requirements of this order in the form of a report submitted to OMB; and (iii) assign at least one senior political appointee responsibility for ensuring compliance with the requirements of this order. Sec. 7. OMB and OPM Review of Agency Training. (a) Consistent with OPM's authority under 5 U.S.C. 4115-4118, all training programs for agency employees relating to diversity or inclusion shall, before being used, be reviewed by OPM for compliance with the requirements of section 6 of this order. (b) If a contractor provides a training for agency employees relating to diversity or inclusion that teaches, advocates, or promotes the divisive concepts set forth in section 2(a) of this order, and such action is in violation of the applicable contract, the agency that contracted for such training shall evaluate whether to pursue debarment of that contractor, consistent with applicable law and regulations, and in consultation with the Interagency Suspension and Debarment Committee. (c) Within 90 days of the date of this order, each agency shall report to OMB all spending in Fiscal Year 2020 on Federal employee training programs relating to diversity or inclusion, whether conducted internally or by contractors. Such report shall, in addition to providing aggregate totals, delineate awards to each individual contractor. (d) The Directors of OMB and OPM may jointly issue guidance and directives pertaining to agency obligations under, and ensuring compliance with, this order. Sec. 8. Title VII Guidance. The Attorney General should continue to assess the extent to which workplace training that teaches the divisive concepts set forth in section 2(a) of this order may contribute to a hostile work environment and give rise to potential liability under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. If appropriate, the Attorney General and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall issue publicly available guidance to assist employers in better promoting diversity and inclusive workplaces consistent with Title VII. Sec. 9. Effective Date. This order is effective immediately, except that the requirements of section 4 of this order shall apply to contracts entered into 60 days after the date of this order. Sec. 10. General Provisions. (a) This order does not prevent agencies, the United States Uniformed Services, or contractors from promoting racial, cultural, or ethnic diversity or inclusiveness, provided such efforts are consistent with the requirements of this order. (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to prohibit discussing, as part of a larger course of academic instruction, the divisive concepts listed in section 2(a) of this order in an objective manner and without endorsement. (c) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. (d) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (e) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

These principles, codified at 5 U.S.C. 2301, call for all employees to 'receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management without regard to' race or sex 'and with proper regard for their . . . constitutional rights.' Instructing Federal employees that treating individuals on the basis of individual merit is racist or sexist directly undermines our Merit System Principles and impairs the efficiency of the Federal service. Similarly, our Uniformed Services should not teach our heroic men and women in uniform the lie that the country for which they are willing to die is fundamentally racist. Such teachings could directly threaten the cohesion and effectiveness of our Uniformed Services. Such activities also promote division and inefficiency when carried out by Federal contractors. The Federal Government has long prohibited Federal contractors from engaging in race or sex discrimination and required contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that such discrimination does not occur. The participation of contractors' employees in training that promotes race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating similarly undermines efficiency in Federal contracting. Such requirements promote divisiveness in the workplace and distract from the pursuit of excellence and collaborative achievements in public administration. Therefore, it shall be the policy of the United States not to promote race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating in the Federal workforce or in the Uniformed Services, and not to allow grant funds to be used for these purposes. In addition, Federal contractors will not be permitted to inculcate such views in their employees. Sec. 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this order, the phrase: (a) 'Divisive concepts' means the concepts that (1) one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex; (2) the United States is fundamentally racist or sexist; (3) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; (4) an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex; (5) members of one race or sex cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race or sex; (6) an individual's moral character is necessarily determined by his or her race or sex; (7) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex; (8) any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex; or (9) meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race to oppress another race. The term 'divisive concepts' also includes any other form of race or sex stereotyping or any other form of race or sex scapegoating. (b) 'Race or sex stereotyping' means ascribing character traits, values, moral and ethical codes, privileges, status, or beliefs to a race or sex, or to an individual because of his or her race or sex. (c) 'Race or sex scapegoating' means assigning fault, blame, or bias to a race or sex, or to members of a race or sex because of their race or sex. It similarly encompasses any claim that, consciously or unconsciously, and by virtue of his or her race or sex, members of any race are inherently racist or are inherently inclined to oppress others, or that members of a sex are inherently sexist or inclined to oppress others. (d) 'Senior political appointee' means an individual appointed by the President, or a non-career member of the Senior Executive Service (or agency-equivalent system). Sec. 3. Requirements for the United States Uniformed Services. The United States Uniformed Services, including the United States Armed Forces, shall not teach, instruct, or train any member of the United States Uniformed Services, whether serving on active duty, serving on reserve duty, attending a military service academy, or attending courses conducted by a military department pursuant to a Reserve Officer Corps Training program, to believe any of the divisive concepts set forth in section 2(a) of this order. No member of the United States Uniformed Services shall face any penalty or discrimination on account of his or her refusal to support, believe, endorse, embrace, confess, act upon, or otherwise assent to these concepts. Sec. 4. Requirements for Government Contractors. (a) Except in contracts exempted in the manner provided by section 204 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965 (Equal Employment Opportunity), as amended, all Government contracting agencies shall include in every Government contract hereafter entered into the following provisions: 'During the performance of this contract, the contractor agrees as follows: 1. The contractor shall not use any workplace training that inculcates in its employees any form of race or sex stereotyping or any form of race or sex scapegoating, including the concepts that (a) one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex; (b) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; (c) an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex; (d) members of one race or sex cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race or sex; (e) an individual's moral character is necessarily determined by his or her race or sex; (f) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex; (g) any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex; or (h) meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race to oppress another race. The term 'race or sex stereotyping' means ascribing character traits, values, moral and ethical codes, privileges, status, or beliefs to a race or sex, or to an individual because of his or her race or sex, and the term 'race or sex scapegoating' means assigning fault, blame, or bias to a race or sex, or to members of a race or sex because of their race or sex. 2. The contractor will send to each labor union or representative of workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice, to be provided by the agency contracting officer, advising the labor union or workers' representative of the contractor's commitments under the Executive Order of September 22, 2020, entitled Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping, and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment. 3. In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (4), or with any rules, regulations, or orders that may be promulgated in accordance with the Executive Order of September 22, 2020, this contract may be canceled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in Executive Order 11246, and such other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided by any rules, regulations, or orders the Secretary of Labor has issued or adopted pursuant to Executive Order 11246, including subpart D of that order. 4. The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (4) in every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance: Provided, however, that in the event the contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of such direction, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.' (b) The Department of Labor is directed, through the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), to establish a hotline and investigate complaints received under both this order as well as Executive Order 11246 alleging that a Federal contractor is utilizing such training programs in violation of the contractor's obligations under those orders. The Department shall take appropriate enforcement action and provide remedial relief, as appropriate. (c) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of OFCCP shall publish in the Federal Register a request for information seeking information from Federal contractors, Federal subcontractors, and employees of Federal contractors and subcontractors regarding the training, workshops, or similar programming provided to employees. The request for information should request copies of any training, workshop, or similar programing having to do with diversity and inclusion as well as information about the duration, frequency, and expense of such activities. Sec. 5. Requirements for Federal Grants. The heads of all agencies shall review their respective grant programs and identify programs for which the agency may, as a condition of receiving such a grant, require the recipient to certify that it will not use Federal funds to promote the concepts that (a) one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex; (b) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; (c) an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex; (d) members of one race or sex cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race or sex; (e) an individual's moral character is necessarily determined by his or her race or sex; (f) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex; (g) any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex; or (h) meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race to oppress another race. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the heads of agencies shall each submit a report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that lists all grant programs so identified. Sec. 6. Requirements for Agencies. (a) The fair and equal treatment of individuals is an inviolable principle that must be maintained in the Federal workplace. Agencies should continue all training that will foster a workplace that is respectful of all employees. Accordingly: (i) The head of each agency shall use his or her authority under 5 U.S.C. 301, 302, and 4103 to ensure that the agency, agency employees while on duty status, and any contractors hired by the agency to provide training, workshops, forums, or similar programming (for purposes of this section, 'training') to agency employees do not teach, advocate, act upon, or promote in any training to agency employees any of the divisive concepts listed in section 2(a) of this order. Agencies may consult with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 4116, in carrying out this provision; and(ii) Agency diversity and inclusion efforts shall, first and foremost, encourage agency employees not to judge each other by their color, race, ethnicity, sex, or any other characteristic protected by Federal law. (b) The Director of OPM shall propose regulations providing that agency officials with supervisory authority over a supervisor or an employee with responsibility for promoting diversity and inclusion, if such supervisor or employee either authorizes or approves training that promotes the divisive concepts set forth in section 2(a) of this order, shall take appropriate steps to pursue a performance-based adverse action proceeding against such supervisor or employee under chapter 43 or 75 of title 5, United States Code. (c) Each agency head shall: (i) issue an order incorporating the requirements of this order into agency operations, including by making compliance with this order a provision in all agency contracts for diversity training; (ii) request that the agency inspector general thoroughly review and assess by the end of the calendar year, and not less than annually thereafter, agency compliance with the requirements of this order in the form of a report submitted to OMB; and (i) assign at least one senior political appointee responsibility for ensuring compliance with the requirements of this order. Sec. 7. OMB and OPM Review of Agency Training. (a) Consistent with OPM's authority under 5 U.S.C. 4115-4118, all training programs for agency employees relating to diversity or inclusion shall, before being used, be reviewed by OPM for compliance with the requirements of section 6 of this order. (b) If a contractor provides a training for agency employees relating to diversity or inclusion that teaches, advocates, or promotes the divisive concepts set forth in section 2(a) of this order, and such action is in violation of the applicable contract, the agency that contracted for such training shall evaluate whether to pursue debarment of that contractor, consistent with applicable law and regulations, and in consultation with the Interagency Suspension and Debarment Committee. (c) Within 90 days of the date of this order, each agency shall report to OMB all spending in Fiscal Year 2020 on Federal employee training programs relating to diversity or inclusion, whether conducted internally or by contractors. Such report shall, in addition to providing aggregate totals, delineate awards to each individual contractor. (d) The Directors of OMB and OPM may jointly issue guidance and directives pertaining to agency obligations under, and ensuring compliance with, this order. Sec. 8. Title VII Guidance. The Attorney General should continue to assess the extent to which workplace training that teaches the divisive concepts set forth in section 2(a) of this order may contribute to a hostile work environment and give rise to potential liability under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. If appropriate, the Attorney General and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall issue publicly available guidance to assist employers in better promoting diversity and inclusive workplaces consistent with Title VII. Sec. 9. Effective Date. This order is effective immediately, except that the requirements of section 4 of this order shall apply to contracts entered into 60 days after the date of this order.

(a) This order does not prevent agencies, the United States Uniformed Services, or contractors from promoting racial, cultural, or ethnic diversity or inclusiveness, provided such efforts are consistent with the requirements of this order. (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to prohibit discussing, as part of a larger course of academic instruction, the divisive concepts listed in section 2(a) of this order in an objective manner and without endorsement. (c) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. (d) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

So we're going to Charlotte , the Charlotte area. We'll be talking about healthcare. We have a lot of good things happening with respect to healthcare and very positive on preexisting conditions, very positive on the fact that we got rid of the individual mandate, which was the single-most unpopular thing having to do with Obamacare, the Obamacare disaster. And , but we have a lot of incredible things, positive things, and very good things, and money-saving things on healthcare. And then we're going to Florida. We have a big rally, and it'll be something , I hear there's a tremendous number of people. So we're not totally surprised by that, but that's okay. A tremendous number of people. Jennifer, go ahead. Q Mr. President, on TikTok, have you had an update today on how the CFIUS negotiations are going on TikTok? THE PRESIDENT: They're working to see if they can make a deal. And if they make a deal, they'll have to bring it to me, and I'll either approve , approve it or not. To me, safety is the predominant factor, and we'll see if they can do that. But they're moving along, and let's see what happens. If they make a deal, that's fine. And if they don't, that's okay too. Q Mr. President, are the election results only legitimate if you win? THE PRESIDENT: So we have to be very careful with the ballots. The ballots , that's a whole big scam. You know, they found, I understand, eight ballots in a waste paper basket in some location. And they found , it was reported in one of the newspapers that they found a lot of ballots in a river. They throw them out if they have the name \"Trump\" on it, I guess. But they had ballots. Q They had no names on them, they said. THE PRESIDENT: Okay, well, they still found them in a river, whether they had a name on it or not. But the other ones had the \"Trump\" name on it, and they were thrown into a waste paper basket. We want to make sure the election is honest, and I'm not sure that it can be. I don't know that it can be with this whole situation , unsolicited ballots. They're unsolicited; millions being sent to everybody. And we'll see. But if you remember, Hillary Clinton, just a week ago or so, told Joe Biden, \"Do not expect the results of the election under any circumstances.\" But you don't ask her that question; you only ask me the question. Yeah, go ahead. Q Can you address: Do you plan to meet with Judge Lagoa? THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q Lagoa. Do you plan to meet with Lagoa? THE PRESIDENT: I don't want to make a comment on that, but we're going to make our decision on Saturday, but I won't comment on that. I will say this: I think Saturday afternoon, five o'clock, it's going to be a very important day in the history of our country. I think it's going to be a very monumental , a very good choice. Q What do you say to the family of Breonna Taylor? THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. Q Sir, what do you say to the family of Breonna Taylor? Q Mr. President, have you made a final choice yet? Have you asked a candidate? THE PRESIDENT: I'm getting , I'm getting very close to a final choice. Q One follow-up: Governor Cuomo said the federal government can't be trusted on a vaccine, and he said New York would have to approve any vaccine that the federal government approves before you'll ship it out. THE PRESIDENT: Well, we're doing , we have numerous companies. We have Johnson & Johnson. We have Pfizer. We have Moderna. We have others too. They're great companies , the best in the world. So I think you put the people of New York in great risk, and he's done that. If you look at the nursing homes, 11,000 people died needlessly. So when you look at that, it's very sad. So we'll see. You'll have to see. But you have , these are great companies. These are being done by the , really, probably some of the greatest companies in the world, when you think, with Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, et cetera. I think that they're getting very close. As you know, they're in final testing right now , phase three, but final. They have given shots to everybody , to a lot; to thousands and thousands of people. And, so far, it looks very good, and it looks like it could happen fairly quickly. Q What do you say to the family of Breonna Taylor, sir? THE PRESIDENT: I think it's a sad thing, and I give my regards to the family of Breonna. I also think it's so sad what's happening with everything about that case, including law enforcement. So many people suffering, so many people needlessly suffering. But with respect to Breonna, we give our regards to the family. Q Sir, you have been nominated for Nobel Peace Prize for Middle East peace. Sir, you have been nominated for Nobel Peace Prize for Middle East , the historic deal that you have done. Does , your global foreign policy also checkmates China. It stops them from increasing the defense of China globally. THE PRESIDENT: Well, it was an honor to be nominated for two Nobel Prizes. So that was an honor. And we'll see what's happening. I know that China now, and India, are having difficulty, and very , very substantial difficulty. And hopefully they'll be able to work that out. If we can help, we'd love to help. Q Mr. President, how did you feel about some of the chanting that was going on outside the Supreme Court: \"Vote you out\" and fulfill , \"Uphold her wish\"? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that was just a political chant. I could , we could hardly hear it from where we were. Somebody said there was some chanting. But they were right next to the media. But we really could hardly hear too much. We heard a sound, but it wasn't very strong. Q What do you think the peaceful protesters are fighting for? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think the peaceful protesters , number one, it's fine to do that in a peaceful manner. But when it gets least , when it gets less than peaceful, as you see all over, then it's unacceptable, and that's where law and order is necessary, and that's where law enforcement is very important. Q But what are they fighting for? THE PRESIDENT: Jennifer, go ahead. Q You didn't answer my question, though. (Inaudible.) Q Susan Collins , THE PRESIDENT: Jennifer, go ahead. Q You didn't answer my question. What are they fighting for? Q Susan Collins, would you , are you endorsing Susan Collins in her race for U.S. Senate in Maine? Are you endorsing Republican Susan Collins? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we're speaking with a lot of people about that. I'm doing very well in Maine. You've seen the numbers. What I've done for Maine is what nobody has done. I have freed up 5,000 square miles of ocean that was taken away by President Obama. And for the lobster , the people that go out and get us those great lobsters that we all like so much, I freed that whole business up, and the fishermen too , we freed it up. So it's , I think I've done more for Maine than just about anybody, certainly in many, many years. So I'm doing very well in Maine. I don't know , I haven't seen polls on Susan, but I hope she does well. Thank you.

We're going to Pennsylvania, and we look forward. We have a big, big crowd. That was great. It was a great honor to be with Amy and her family. She's going to have an amazing future. I think it's going to go quickly, I hope. And , but I think she's got a great future. Brilliant. When the professor at Notre Dame , one of the most highly respected , said \"the best student\" he's ever had, that means something. And first in her class and all of that. So it's a , it's a great honor. Today was a big , a big thrill. Q Are you expecting fireworks at her confirmation fight? THE PRESIDENT: I think it's very hard. I mean, I don't know how they can do it. The question was: \"Do I expect any fireworks at the confirmation?\" I think it's very hard. She's , you know, where? What could you say? The best student, best academically, great judge, great professor. The highest recommendations, right? So I think it's very, very hard for them to do it. Q Mr. President, how do you feel about a majority of Americans wanting to wait until after the election? The winner should nominate. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don't think they know Amy , when they get to meet her and get to see her. But, you know, this is just something , we have a lot of time, because if you really look, you know, we don't have to do it before. But I think this will be done before the election, and I think it'll send a great signal to a lot of people. But she's outstanding, and I'm glad you could be there. So we're going to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and there's going to be a lot of people there, and that's good. And I think we're doing very well. Thank you. We're leading in Pennsylvania. We're leading in Florida. I think we're leading everywhere. Q Mr. President, on another topic: Do you have confidence in Director Wray? THE PRESIDENT: Well, he disagrees with us on a couple of things. We'll see what's going on. But if you look at the ballots , you know, they found ballots in a garbage can, and they had the name \"Trump\" on them. They were cast for Trump, and they found them in a garbage can. They found many ballots, as you know, in a riverbed, in a state , in a certain state. They had another case where a thousand ballots were sent, but not single , they were sent double, so you get to vote twice. This whole thing , I've been telling you, this whole ballot scam is going to cause a lot of problems for our country. I want to see a very peaceful transition, but it's got to be a legal process. When you get thousands of ballots sent to people and they're double ballots, where you get two votes , and that's just one of many problems. Go back and look at the Iowa primary, Democrat primary. They still don't know who won. I mean, if you look at it, it was a disaster, using this system. And I don't think they know who won yet. Many ballots were missing. There was fraud. There was , look, we can't do this. And that was a relatively small number of people. We can't do this to our country. So we're going to see. We're going to watch, and we're watching very closely. The U.S. attorneys are watching, the Attorney General is watching, the sheriffs are watching, local police is watching. And it's a very sad thing. Also, Bloomberg , Bloomberg can't go to Florida and pay people to vote. He's paying people to , he committed a crime if he does that. And he has done that. So, you know, he understands that. So, that's it. Q Are you getting ready for the debate? And are you going to go on the attack against Biden at the debate? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I can't tell you what I'm going to do. I mean, I don't know. I'm going to go to the debate. Steve is just asking, \"Will I go on the attack?\" I have no idea. I have no idea how he's going to be. He's always different when he comes out because he's on a different medication, I guess. But he's always very different when he comes out. So I have no idea what's coming out. But I've been doing this for a long time, but he's been doing this for 47 years; I've been doing it for four years. There's a big difference. Q Would you be comfortable if abortion becomes illegal in certain states? THE PRESIDENT: You're going to have to talk. Q Would you be okay if abortion becomes illegal in certain states as a result? THE PRESIDENT: Well, that's going to be up to all of the justices. They're going to see. I never discussed that with Amy. This is something that , because it wouldn't be appropriate to discuss.

Thank you. Thank you. I stand before you today to fulfill one of my highest and most important duties under the United States Constitution: the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice. (Applause.) This is my third such nomination after Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh. And it is a very proud moment indeed. Over the past week, our nation has mourned the loss of a true American legend. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a legal giant and a pioneer for women. Her extraordinary life and legacy will inspire Americans for generations to come. Now we gather in the Rose Garden to continue our never-ending task of ensuring equal justice and preserving the impartial rule of law. Today, it is my honor to nominate one of our nation's most brilliant and gifted legal minds to the Supreme Court. She is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials, and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution: Judge Amy Coney Barrett. (Applause.) We're also joined by Amy's husband, Jesse , thank you, Jesse, very much , and their seven beautiful children. Congratulations to you all. A very special day. With us as well are the First Lady , thank you, First Lady , (applause) , along with Vice President Mike Pence and his amazing wife, Karen. Thank you very much, Mike. (Applause.) Judge Barrett is a graduate of Rhodes College and the University of Notre Dame Law School. At Notre Dame, she earned a full academic scholarship, served as the Executive Editor of the Law Review, graduated first in her class, and received the law school's award for the best record of scholarship and achievement. Upon graduation, she became a clerk for Judge Laurence Silberman on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Amy then received one of the highest honors a young lawyer could have, serving as a clerk on the Supreme Court for Justice Antonin Scalia. A highly , (applause) , a very highly respected law professor at Notre Dame wrote to Justice Scalia with a one-sentence recommendation: \"Amy Coney is the best student I ever had.\" That's pretty good. (Laughter.) Justice Scalia hired her shortly thereafter. And we are honored to have his wonderful wife, Maureen , where is Maureen? Maureen Scalia , with us today. (Applause.) Thank you. And our great Secretary of Labor, thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. (Applause.) Very good genes in that family, I will say. Very good genes. Before joining the bench, Judge Barrett spent 15 years as a Professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School. She was renowned for her scholarship, celebrated by her colleagues, and beloved by her students. Three times, she was selected at Notre Dame, Distinguished Professor of the Year. When I nominated Judge Barrett to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 2017, every law clerk from her time at the Supreme Court endorsed her and endorsed her nomination, writing, quote, \"We are Democrats, Republicans, and independents yet we write to support the nomination of Professor Barrett to be a Circuit Judge Professor Barrett is a woman of remarkable intellect and character. She is eminently qualified for the job.\" And I can tell you, I did that too. I looked and I studied, and you are very eminently qualified for this job. You are going to be fantastic. Thank you. (Applause.) Really fantastic. The entire Notre Dame Law facility and faculty, everybody , everybody at that school also , we got so many letters , also wrote letters of support of Amy's nomination to the Seventh Circuit. They wrote, in effect: \"Despite our differences, we unanimously agree that our constitutional system depends upon an independent judiciary staffed by talented people devoted to the fair and impartial administration of the rule of law. And we unanimously agree that Amy is such a person.\" For the last three years, Judge Barrett has served with immense distinction on the federal bench. Amy is more than a stellar scholar and judge; she is also a profoundly devoted mother. Her family is a core part of who Amy is. She opened her home and her heart, and adopted two beautiful children from Haiti. Her incredible bond with her youngest child, a son with Down Syndrome, is a true inspiration. If confirmed, Justice Barrett will make history as the first mother of school-aged children ever to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. That's good. (Applause.) To her children Emma, Vivian, Tess, John Peter, Liam, Juliet, and Benjamin, thank you for sharing your incredible mom with our country. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Amy Coney Barrett will decide cases based on the text of the Constitution as written. As Amy has said, \"Being a judge takes courage. You are not there to decide cases as you may prefer. You are there to do your duty and to follow the law wherever it may take you.\" That is exactly what Judge Barrett will do on the U.S. Supreme Court. I want to thank the members of the Senate. We have so many of them here today. Thank you very much. I see you in the audience, and you're so proud. But I want to thank you for your commitment and to providing a fair and timely hearing. I know it will be that. Judge Barrett was confirmed to the Circuit Court three years ago by a bipartisan vote. Her qualifications are unsurpassed , unsurpassed , and her record is beyond reproach. This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation. It should be very easy. Good luck. (Laughter.) It's going to be very quick. I'm sure it'll be extremely non-controversial. We said that the last time, didn't we? Well, thank you all very much, and thank you for being here. That's really great. Thank you. (Applause.) I further urge all members of the other side of the aisle to provide Judge Barrett with the respectful and dignified hearing that she deserves and, frankly, that our country deserves. I urge lawmakers and members of the media to refrain from personal or partisan attacks. And the stakes for our country are incredibly high. Rulings that the Supreme Court will issue in the coming years will decide the survival of our Second Amendment, our religious liberty, our public safety, and so much more. To maintain security, liberty, and prosperity, we must preserve our priceless heritage of a nation of laws, and there is no one better to do that than Amy Coney Barrett. Law and order is the foundation of the American system of justice. No matter the issue, no matter the case before her, I am supremely confident that Judge Barrett will issue rulings based solely upon a fair reading of the law. She will defend the sacred principle of equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. Congratulations again to Judge Barrett. I know that you will make our country very, very proud.Please, Amy, say a few words. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Congratulations. (Applause.) JUDGE BARRETT: Thank you very much, Mr. President. I am deeply honored by the confidence that you have placed in me. And I am so grateful to you and the First Lady, to the Vice President and the Second Lady, and to so many others here for your kindness on this rather overwhelming occasion. I fully understand that this is a momentous decision for a President. And if the Senate does me the honor of confirming me, I pledge to discharge the responsibilities of this job to the very best of my ability. I love the United States, and I love the United States Constitution. I am truly , (applause) , I am truly humbled by the prospect of serving on the Supreme Court. Should I be confirmed, I will be mindful of who came before me. The flag of the United States is still flying at half-staff in memory of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to mark the end of a great American life. Justice Ginsburg began her career at a time when women were not welcome in the legal profession. But she not only broke glass ceilings, she smashed them. For that, she has won the admiration of women across the country and, indeed, all over the world. (Applause.) She was a woman of enormous talent and consequence, and her life of public service serves as an example to us all. Particularly poignant to me was her long and deep friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia, my own mentor. Justices Scalia and Ginsburg disagreed fiercely in print without rancor in person. Their ability to maintain a warm and rich friendship, despite their differences, even inspired an opera. These two great Americans demonstrated that arguments, even about matters of great consequence, need not destroy affection. In both my personal and professional relationships, I strive to meet that standard. I was lucky enough to clerk for Justice Scalia, and given his incalculable influence on my life, I am very moved to have members of the Scalia family here today, including his dear wife, Maureen. I clerked for Justice Scalia more than 20 years ago, but the lessons I learned still resonate. His judicial philosophy is mine too: A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold. The President has asked me to become the ninth justice, and as it happens, I'm used to being in a group of nine: my family. (Laughter.) Our family includes me, my husband Jesse, Emma, Vivian, Tess, John Peter, Liam, Juliet, and Benjamin. Vivian and John Peter, as the President said, were born in Haiti and they came to us, five years apart, when they were very young. And the most revealing fact about Benjamin, our youngest, is that his brothers and sisters unreservedly identify him as their favorite sibling. Our children obviously make our life very full. While I am a judge, I'm better known back home as a room parent, carpool driver, and birthday party planner. When schools went remote last spring, I tried on another hat. Jesse and I became co-principals of the Barrett e-learning academy. (Laughter.) And, yes, the list of enrolled students was a very long one. Our children are my greatest joy, even though they deprive me of any reasonable amount of sleep. I couldn't manage this very full life without the unwavering support of my husband, Jesse. At the start of our marriage, I imagined that we would run our household as partners. As it has turned out, Jesse does far more than his share of the work. To my chagrin, I learned at dinner recently that my children consider him to be the better cook. (Laughter.) For 21 years, Jesse has asked me, every single morning, what he can do for me that day. And though I almost always say \"nothing,\" he still finds ways to take things off my plate. And that's not because he has a lot of free time , he has a busy law practice , it's because he is a superb and generous husband, and I am very fortunate. Jesse and I , (applause) , Jesse and I have a life full of relationships, not only with our children, but with siblings, friends, and fearless babysitters, one of whom is with us today. I am particularly grateful to my parents, Mike and Linda Coney. I spent the bulk of , I have spent the bulk of my adulthood as a Midwesterner, but I grew up in their New Orleans home. And as my brother and sisters can also attest, Mom and Dad's generosity extends not only to us, but to more people than any of us could count. They are an inspiration. It is important at a moment like this to acknowledge family and friends. But this evening, I also want to acknowledge you, my fellow Americans. The President has nominated me to serve on the United States Supreme Court, and that institution belongs to all of us. If confirmed, I would not assume that role for the sake of those in my own circle, and certainly not for my own sake. I would assume this role to serve you. I would discharge the judicial oath, which requires me to administer justice without respect to persons, do equal right to the poor and rich, and faithfully and impartially discharge my duties under the United States Constitution. I have no illusions that the road ahead of me will be easy, either for the short term or the long haul. I never imagined that I would find myself in this position. But now that I am, I assure you that I will meet the challenge with both humility and courage. Members of the United States Senate, I look forward to working with you during the confirmation process, and I will do my very best to demonstrate that I am worthy of your support. Thank you. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Come on up, family. Come on up, family. I want to acknowledge Attorney General Bill Barr. Bill, thank you very much for being here. Chief of Staff , thank you very much, Chief. You're doing a great job. And all of the senators , please, we really appreciate it. And I know you're going to have a busy couple of weeks, but I think it's going to be easier than you might think. So, thank you very much for being here. Thank you all. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Congratulations, Amy. (Applause.)

I mean, you'll have to give me a definition, because I really don't know who they are. I can only say they have to stand down, let law enforcement do their work. Law enforcement will do the work more and more. As people see how bad this radical, liberal, Democrat movement is and how weak , the law enforcement is going to come back stronger and stronger. But again, I don't know who Proud Boys are. But whoever they are, they have to stand down. Let law enforcement do their work. Q So, Mr. President, did you misspeak when you said \"stand by\"? That's my , my first question. When you said , THE PRESIDENT: Just \"stand by.\" Look, law enforcement will do their work. They're going to stand down. They have to stand down. Everybody , they have to stand , whatever group you're talking about, let law enforcement do the work. Now, Antifa is a real problem, because the problem is on the left and Biden refuses to talk about it. He refuses to issue the words \"law and order.\" And you saw that last night when he choked up. He can't say the words because he'll lose the rest of the left. So he's got to condemn Antifa. Antifa is a very bad group. Q So, Mr. President, let me follow up: White supremacists, they clearly love you and support you. Do you welcome that? THE PRESIDENT: I want law and order to be a very important part , it's a very important part of my campaign. And when I say that, what I'm talking about is law enforcement has to , the police have to take care. And they should stop defunding the police like they've done in New York , Q But I'm talking about white supremacists, sir. THE PRESIDENT: , like they've done in New York. I just told you. Q But do you denounce them? Do you denounce white supr- , THE PRESIDENT: I've always denounced any form , Q Of white supremacy? THE PRESIDENT: Any form , any form of any of that, you have to denounce. But I also , and Joe Biden has to say something about Antifa. It's not a philosophy. These are people that hit people over the head with baseball bats. He's got to come out and he's got to be strong, and he's got to condemn Antifa. And it's very important that he does that. Q So looking at (inaudible) Joe Biden, can I follow up, sir, on that? Q Mr. President, on the election, you are , you claim that you , that you have an , your response to coronavirus , THE PRESIDENT: I can't hear a word you're saying. I can't hear. Q But , no, but , Q Will you , will you debate again? Will you go ahead with the other two debates that are coming up? Will you debate again? THE PRESIDENT: I hear he doesn't want to go forward. But that's up to him. I mean , Q But what about you? Are you going forward? THE PRESIDENT: I would , yeah, I would like to. We , by every measure, we won the debate easily last night. I think he was very weak. Q Would you like to see any changes? THE PRESIDENT: He looked weak. He was whining. Uh, yeah, we won the debate by almost every poll that I saw. If you look at the , the various polls. And I looked at about six of them, and we won every one of them. So, no, I don't mind debating him. I hear he wants to get out of the debates. I don't know. That's up to him. Q Sir, there's a lot of worry , there's a lot of worry about the right-wing militias that are armed and going into the streets with weapons. Does that concern you that they go out there with their weapons and walk around in the streets? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, it does concern me. And crime generally concerns me , any form of crime. And let law enforcement take care of it. Q Mr. President, why are you afraid of the election? Why are you afraid of , THE PRESIDENT: So we had a problem in New York. They have 100,000 ballots that are a mess. They're all confused, all mixed up. Now they say they're going to redo them, but what are they going to do with 100,000 ballots that have already been sent? This is exactly what I'm talking about. It's a big, big, big-scale problem. A hundred thousand ballots went out to New York with the wrong names on the, wrong envelops, wrong addresses, wrong everything. And now they want to redo the ballots, but that doesn't help because what about the ones that are already sent? This is exactly what I'm talking about. Q Can I follow up to that, Mr. President? If there was an apparent Joe Biden victory come the 20th of January and you , THE PRESIDENT: There , there won't be. There won't be. Q Sir, what if there is? Would you challenge it?

{"SpeechID":"VSDT1102020365","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-10-01","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump to Guests at the Al Smith Dinner","Type":"speech","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: It is a profound honor to address the 75th annual Al Smith Dinner. For generations, this wonderful event has been a revered institution in New York and New York life. I fondly remember attending with my father a long time ago. I was a young man, but never forgot it. This organization's incredible tradition of Catholic charity exemplifies the very best not only of this city, but of this country. I want to thank Cardinal Dolan , a very special man , for his extraordinary stewardship of the Archdiocese and for his deep dedication to God and to our nation. I also want to thank him for all of the help he's given me, and so many things and so many different ways. Thank you very much, Cardinal. We very much appreciate it. Let me also thank Mary Erdoes and the entire Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation. As you know, tonight's Al Smith Dinner is unlike any other, sadly. Our country, and the entire world, have been struck with a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic. China shouldn't have let it happen, but it did. When the virus came in from China, we saw New Yorkers respond with the same grit and tenacity, courage, and selflessness that have always defined this city that we love so much. Doctors and nurses worked around the clock. The heroes of the New York PD , NYPD , we love them and they endorsed me, so I like them even more. But they are great. New York's Finest. And the FDNY, the bravest , they are the bravest, they're great; I know them all very well , and other first responders risked their lives to save others. And of course, the Catholic community and the men and women of the New York Archdiocese answered the call and, frankly, answered it like nobody else could. In Catholic schools, hospitals, shelters, soup kitchens, and food pantries, you served with the supreme devotion to your fellow citizens. The Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation made a historic $8 million dollar gift to support the children and the families of New York. Thank you. You showed the world the essence of the Catholic faith. I've known about it for a long time. I lived right next to a magnificent Catholic church. As Jesus Christ said in the Gospel, \"Everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.\" As President, I want to thank the Catholic community for the magnificent generosity you showed in America's hour of need. We mourn for all of those who lost a loved one, and in their memory, we will defeat the virus. Through advances in treatment, we have reduced the fatality rate by 85 percent since just April. We are on track to develop and distribute a vaccine before the end of the year, and maybe substantially before. And I just want to say that the end of the pandemic is in sight, and next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country. From the very beginning of our republic, Catholics have uplifted and enriched our nation beyond measure. Catholics like Charles Carroll helped secure American independence. Women like Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton founded a movement that created thousands of schools and lifted children out of poverty. And the great Al Smith, the original \"Happy Warrior,\" , that's what he was; he was a happy warrior. I know it well. I consider myself to be a happy warrior, but it's not so easy in these times. But he was a happy warrior of American politics. He spent his life fighting for hardworking Americans and battling the anti-Catholic prejudice that you see even today coming out of the Democrat party. Today, this amazing group continues that proud tradition of faithful service. Your work reminds us of an essential truth: In this country, civil society, and especially our religious institutions, are an essential foundation of American freedom. Our nation is strong because of Catholics and, frankly, people of all faiths. That is why, as President, one of my top priorities is to defend religious liberty and the cherished role of faith and faith-based organizations in our national life. To protect your God-given rights, I was recently honored to nominate one of our most brilliant legal minds, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, to the United States Supreme Court, and that was an honor indeed. She is a proud graduate of the University of Notre Dame Law School where her professor, one of the most respected anywhere in the country, said she was the single greatest student he's ever had in his class. We will not stand for any attacks against Judge Barrett's faith. Anti-Catholic bigotry has absolutely no place in the United States of America. It predominates in the Democrat party, and we must do something immediately about it, like a Republican win, and let's make it a really big one. To support the noble mission of Catholic schools, my administration is working to advance School Choice. It was my great honor to help the Catholic Church with its schools. They needed hundreds of millions of dollars nationwide, and I got it for them. Nobody else. I got it for them. I hope you remember that on November 3rd, but I got it for them. And it was an honor to do it. I did it at the request of Cardinal Dolan and others of your leaders. They really needed it. We took care of that situation. Very important. We are once again standing with Catholic charities and healthcare providers such as the Little Sisters of the Poor. We've been with them all in the way in this long fight. We are fighting for Catholic adoption agencies and fighting hard. And we are defending the sacred right to life. Remember that when you vote,. That's so important, and so important to the Supreme Court. Every child, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of God. Few institutions in history have done more for New York, more for America, or more for people of the world than the Catholic Church. From the parishes of this city came the soldiers who fought to end slavery, the workers who raised up the towering skyline of Manhattan, the chaplains who landed on the beaches of Guadalcanal, the nuns who marched for civil rights, and the police officers and firefighters who we love so much, who ran into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Now more than ever, our nation needs a renewal of the values that this organization promotes and that the Catholic faithful live out each and every day in peace. We love the Catholic people. We love the Catholic religion. And above all, we respect it greatly. As President, I will always support you in your effort to serve our fellow citizens and to lift up all humanity. I will protect the Catholic Church, and I will defend the rights of religious believers of every race, religion, color, and creed. Thank you once again to the Al Smith Memorial Foundation. God bless You, God bless New York, and God bless America.

Throughout this Down Syndrome Awareness Month, the First Lady and I celebrate these remarkable people, members of our families, communities, and Nation, and my Administration reasserts its commitment to standing against those who seek to discriminate, devalue, and demean the sanctity of their lives. The future for Americans with Down syndrome is more exciting and more hopeful than ever before, as we continue cutting edge research and develop therapies. In 2019, the National Institutes of Health invested $35 million toward more advanced Down syndrome research. In September 2020, an additional $60 million was dedicated to bolster funding for Downs syndrome research. These funds will lead to scientific breakthroughs and broaden our understanding of Down syndrome so that we can more effectively improve the health of these American citizens and expand their opportunities to thrive in our society. As our society progresses toward a more inclusive future, there are still those who pass judgment on which lives are worth living. As President, I denounce radical proposals to terminate pregnancies of unborn children with Down syndrome. Our Nation will continue to emphatically affirm the self-evident ideal that all children, born and unborn, are created in the image of God, are worthy of life, and deserve to be loved. Our country must never run astray from the certitude that the lives of those with Down syndrome are precious and full of potential.

May God bless you and keep watch over those in peril on the sea, and may God bless the United States of America."}
{"SpeechID":"VSDT1310202068","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-10-13","SpeechTitle":"Donald Trump Rally Johnstown","Type":"statement","RawText":"President Trump: (01:02)Hello, Johnstown. Thank you very much. This is going to be a great evening. Incredible to be back in Pennsylvania, the proud home of American independence, the American constitution and American freedom. That's true. Huh? What a history. And 21 days days from now, we're going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we're going to win four more years in the White House. This election is a simple choice. If Biden wins, China wins, all these other countries win. We get ripped off by everybody. If we win, you win, Pennsylvania wins and America wins, very simple. For years, the selfish and corrupt political class betrayed the people of Pennsylvania, you know that, and the people of our country. Career politicians like Joe Biden lied to you. I don't think he knew he was even lying. You want to know the truth. He's gone. He's shot folks. I hate to tell you, he's shot. He abused you, he crushed you, your dreams and outsourced your jobs to China and distant lands all over the world. President Trump: (02:14)As a Senator Biden's last American trade policies were a total disaster. They dismantled your steel industry and decimated entire towns in your area. And we brought back steel and we put tariffs on steel and we stopped dumping steel and aluminum. As vice-president, he closed down 10,000 factories while raking in cash from corporations that moved jobs overseas, and his family got rich. You know that. President Trump: (02:48)How did Hunter make three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Russia, mayor of Moscow's wife? How did that happen? So you have the mayor of Moscow, got a wife, gave Hunter three and a half million bucks. I wonder what he did for that money, huh? The fake news, they refused to talk about it. They don't want to hear about it. President Trump: (03:09)Biden's a servant of the radical globalist, the wealthy donors, the big money special interests, who shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories and you know it, because you really suffered right in this area, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in these ridiculous, endless foreign wars. They're all coming back home. Don't worry. They're all coming back home, soon. They're already on their way. They've been on their way for a long time. President Trump: (03:42)In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this failed and decrepit political establishment. And you elected an outsider as your president to finally put America first. That's what we did. And we did not come this far, overcome this much, and fight this hard only to surrender our country back to the depraved, Washington swamp. And by the way, did we catch them? We caught them. We caught them. We caught them. Watch what happens. Watch what happens. They spied on our campaign. What they did should never, ever be allowed to happen in this country again, never. Watch what happens. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party's nomination. He has handed control to the socialists and Marxists and left-wing extremists like his vice presidential candidate. That's another great one, isn't it? President Trump: (04:52)I just watched her on television coming in, because the great thing about Air Force One, we have more televisions. They're in closets. They're all over the place. They're on the floors, on the ceilings. And I watched her and I compared her to Amy, great future Supreme court justice. And I will tell you Amy's made a great impression. Crowd: (05:18)Fill that seat. Fill that seat. Fill that seat. President Trump: (05:29)And you know, Biden, he can't stand up to the lunatics running his party. He can't even find his way off the stage without them. Look what's happened. Yesterday, he didn't know the name. He said, \"You know the guy, I think he's a Mormon, right\"\" He said, \"He's a Mormon.\" He was talking about Mitt Romney. He forgot Mitt Romney's name. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine. Then he didn't know where he was. He said, \"Where the hell am I? Where am I?\" No, he's shot folks. He's shot. President Trump: (05:58)I'm running against the single worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. And you know what that does? That puts more pressure on me. Can you imagine if you lose to a guy like this? It's unbelievable. It's disgusting. It's disgraceful. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country. He won't be running the country. The radical left will take over. President Trump: (06:22)And how about Pennsylvania? So he says, \"There will be no fracking, no fracking.\" This went on for a year and a half. No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. Then Elizabeth Warren refused to get out. So they stole another one for Bernie. Bernie is the greatest loser of them all. This guy, every four years they steal it. So she refused to get out, Pocahontas. She refused to get out. They wanted me to apologize for saying the word Pocahontas. So no, no. I apologize to Pocahontas, [inaudible 00:06:52]. No, no, she wouldn't get out. And she took enough votes away and Biden won super Tuesday. That shouldn't have happened. President Trump: (07:03)But if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, fortunately that's because I'm not a politician. I'm not a politician. But think of that, you talk about politician, no fracking for a year and a half, right? And then he goes to Pennsylvania says, \"No, no, there'll be fracking.\" Like nothing happened. Can you imagine if I did that? No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. I'm the opposite, by the way. No fracking, no fracking. Then you win and you go, I've got to go a little to the other direction, a little bit to the right. Although he actually went further to the left, which is sort of an amazing thing, but all of a sudden he comes out in favor of fracking. President Trump: (07:42)And let me tell you, it's always the first thing that turns out to be true. Okay. They will lose, you will lose, in Pennsylvania a million jobs. There will be no petroleum products. There will be no fracking whatsoever. And did you see his party now is really angry at him because he's saying maybe there'll be fracking. It's a very conditional, it's a very weak, but with me, you're going to frack. You're going to frack. And you're going to keep your energy low. And we're independent, we are now energy independent, first time ever. President Trump: (08:16)So if I don't always play by the rules of the Washington establishment it's because I was elected to fight for you. And I fought harder for you than any president has ever fought for their people. Right now I'm fighting to eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. And that's a big thing, saving it, because these people, this will end up being a large scale version of Venezuela, if they get in. They don't have water. They don't have medicine. They don't have food. They don't have anything. Despite everything they've thrown at us, we've done more in the first three and a half years than any administration in history. And the best is yet to come. That's true. President Trump: (09:06)A recent Gallup poll just came out. Crowd: (09:08)Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. President Trump: (09:21)Thank you. A Gallup poll just came out that found that 56% of Americans say they're better off today than they were under Sleepy Joe and Obama. That's the highest of any president at this point in his term. Let's think of that, 56%. This is as we round the corner on the pandemic, 56%. they were much, much lower. Just remember this, if they were any good I wouldn't have run for president, but they were no good. They did a horrible job. They did a horrible job. President Trump: (09:56)Yesterday, Biden told those 56% of Americans that they probably shouldn't vote for him. And for once I agree with Joe. Did you hear? He said, \"You shouldn't vote for me.\" He has no idea what he's saying. How the hell do you lose to a guy like this? Is this possible. Oh, I'll never come to Pennsylvania again. I love this place. They say he was born in Scranton, but he left. He left. He abandoned you. Give me a break. Crowd: (10:27)We love you. We love you. We love you. President Trump: (10:34)Thank you. Crowd: (10:34)We love you. President Trump: (10:34)I love you, too. Crowd: (10:34)We love you. We love you. We love you. President Trump: (10:38)Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. By the way, there's a lot of people here tonight. Got a lot of people. I wish the fake news would show it. They never turn the cameras. I go home, our great first lady always says, \"How was the crowd?\" I said, \"Didn't they show it?\" \"No, they just show your face.\" And about five people behind me, right? They become famous. Why don't you show the crowd though? Why don't you do yourself a favor, show the crowd. President Trump: (11:18)One of the most important issues for Pennsylvania is the survival of your fracking industry. Joe Biden has repeatedly pledged to abolish fracking. He's a liar. Okay. He's a liar. How do you do it? How do you do it? He went for a year and a half. They said, \"Are you \" remember the debates with the radical left Democrats? You had Alfred E Newman. You had all these people, you know who Alfred E. Newman is? Yes. Pete Buttigieg, Pete Buttigieg, he was a bad mayor of a failed town and he's going to run for president. Pete Buttigieg, but you know he's talking about it. And does that mean everybody, nobody is going to do fracking? That's right. Nobody. Nobody, I swear. Nobody, nobody, nobody. Then he gets up, I've never seen anything like it in my life, and not one fake reporter back there said, \"Well, wait a minute, you've been pledging for a year and a half, no fracking.\" President Trump: (12:14)But then what about the healthcare for illegal immigrants? Who in this group is going to provide healthcare for illegal immigrants? Everybody raises their hand. You remember Joe? No, do you remember? This is a famous clip, but they don't ask him questions about it because they're fake. You remember Joe? Who is going to provide And look, we all have hearts and we want to take care of everybody. But you know the problem when you do that, we don't have the money. The whole world is going to empty out into our country. They're going to come for healthcare. They're going to come for college, free college. I say sometimes jokingly sarcastically, \"Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce.\" To which CNN says, \"They don't get a free Rolls-Royce. He has misrepresented.\" President Trump: (12:57)These people are sick. Crowd: (13:07)CNN sucks. CNN Sucks. CNN sucks. CNN Sucks. CNN sucks. CNN Sucks. President Trump: (13:08)Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce. They don't get a free Rolls-Royce. The president has misrepresented. They are sick people. But think of it, so remember when Joe and they said, \"Raise your hand if everybody's in favor of free, everything, credit free everything, but free healthcare for illegal aliens.\" And Joe goes like, he had no idea what the hell he was doing, folks. He has no clue. And he's not a nice guy. Just so you understand, not a nice guy. If he was a nice guy, I wouldn't hit him like this, but he's not a nice guy. He's a bad guy. He's always been a dummy. He's never been No, no. In his best of years, he was considered a dumb guy. When asked about fracking, Biden said he \"would sure, absolutely make it. We will eliminate it.\" That's what he said. Those are the exact words. And then he said it 19 different times. President Trump: (14:04)Then one day he said, \"I never said that.\" It's incredible. And they don't question him. I couldn't get away with it for a minute, not for a minute. Did you see the town hall he had with NBC? That was a town hall for a child, a young child. Barron Trump, and actually Barron's far too advanced for that town hall. That was a town hall, Lester Holt, Lester Holt. That was a beauty, right? That was some town hall. And they said, \"Yes, we have a random sampling of people.\" Yeah. All Trump haters. What a group of people. But he raised his hand. He said, \"Illegal immigrants will get healthcare.\" Now people don't realize what that means. That means your social security goes down the tubes, your country goes bankrupt. The whole thing is a disaster, but he raised his hand. Now he's trying to say he didn't do it. And they don't call him out because they're fake. President Trump: (15:04)His radical left running mate, who I just watched on television, she is so pathetic, is a co-sponsor of the socialist green new deal, which eliminates all fossil fuels. She's having a hard time getting out of that one. Did you hear the other day? She actually came out in favor of fracking. It was like, \"Yeah, I think so.\" She's further left than Bernie. Did you see Bernie, I thought was the furthest left in the Senate, because you don't get too much worse. Then you go, instead of socialists, you go to the C-word, right? She's further left. She's considered further left than Bernie. When Nancy Pelosi does the 25th amendment, she's doing it for Biden. You do know that, right? Because they want to get Biden out and that won't be hard. But at this very moment, Biden's website includes a pledge to mandate net zero carbon emissions, which means fossil fuel, coal, everything is gone and it's gone soon. Okay. President Trump: (16:09)And with that goes our economy, and with that goes our country. The Democrat party hates fracking. They hate coal. They hate clean, beautiful coal. I see what they do with coal now. They hate domestic energy production and Biden will shut you down. He wants to shut you down just like your governor's got you shut down right now. They better open up your state. Did you see the World Health Organization yesterday? They said Trump was right. They said you can't make the cure worse than the problem itself. I've been saying that for a long time. And we did the right thing. We saved 2 million lives. They said 2.2 million people. We saved 2 million lives and we get nothing, and I'll tell you what, the vaccines are coming soon, the therapeutics and frankly, the cure. All I know is I took something, whatever the hell it was, I felt good very quickly. I don't know what it was. Antibodies, antibodies. I don't know. I took it. I said, I felt like Superman. And I said, \"Let me at them.\" No, and I could have been here four or five days ago. It's great. We have great doctors. President Trump: (17:22)I want to thank the doctors at Walter Reed and Johns Hopkins, great doctors. One great thing about being president, if you're not feeling 100%, you have more doctors than you thought existed in the world. I was surrounded with 14 of them. Where are you from? \"I'm from this one.\" Where are you from? \"I'm from Johns Hopkins.\" \"I'm from Walter Reed.\" But what great talented people. They did a great job and thank you. And while I'm president, America will remain the world's number one energy producer with Pennsylvania workers leading the way and that's what's happening. You're leading the way. President Trump: (18:00)You're leading [inaudible 00:00:18:00]. President Trump: (18:04)You know, you had the best year in the history of your place. It's a history of if you look at the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, you never want to say state. Don't ever say state. Actually, nobody cares but them, but you know. President Trump: (18:18)I'm just saying, let's say Pennsylvania, you got two of them. You know that, right? The Commonwealth, the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I went to school here. Probably spent more time here than sleepy Joe in all fairness, I went to school here. But we're putting our great coal miners back to work. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments. You see that happening. And we've got Did you see in the debate the other night, I said to him, \"Name one law enforcement agency, just one in a whole country that supports you.\" He couldn't do it. Then Chris Wallace bailed him out. Then I say, \"How come you got the three and a half million from Russia?\" And they bailed him out again. He was choking like a dog. They bailed him out. President Trump: (19:02)But they want to dissolve your borders. They don't want borders. They want to have open borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes, confiscate your guns, get rid of your Second Amendment. President Trump: (19:16)I mean, here's one that's incredible, destroy your suburbs. Okay, so they talk about the suburban women. And somebody said, \"I don't know if the suburban woman likes you.\" I say, \"Why?\" But we had this I love you too. President Trump: (19:34)They said, \"They may not like the way you talk,\" but I'm about law and order. I'm about having you safe. I'm about having your suburban communities. I don't want to build low-income housing next to your house. Okay, if that's okay? And I ended the regulation, the rule that made the zoning so impossible that you had to destroy your communities. And then I hear the suburban woman. I think that the suburban woman, and I used to say suburban housewife, I used to take heat, but I said, \"Does anybody care?\" Do you care? If I say suburb? No, they're all going to no. Again, the only one cares is them. \"Trump said suburban housewife,\" but I didn't say it because I don't. You learn very quickly. You learn very quickly. But suburban women, they should like me more than anybody here tonight because I ended the regulation that destroyed your neighborhood. I ended the regulation that brought crime to the suburbs and you're going to live the American dream. And that's what you're going to do. President Trump: (20:31)And remember this, 29% of the people experiencing the American dream in the suburbs happened to be minority. And you don't know that. But 29%. and we're doing this for everybody. We're not doing it one way or the other. We're doing it. And I ended it. They said, \"Sir, we can amend it.\" I said, \"I don't want to amend it. I want to end it.\" It was a horror show. And this loser, Corey Booker is the guy that's going to be in charge of the program. The guy's a stone-cold loser. 1%, he got 1%. He ran. He was going to be great. You know, 1%. every week he was like her, down, down, down. They should've picked him. But no he'll be in charge of you're a suburban President Trump: (21:10)So can I ask you to do me a favor, suburban women, will you please like me? Please. Please. I saved your damn neighborhood, okay? The other thing I don't have that much time to be that nice. You know, I can do it, but I got to go quickly. We don't have time. They want me to be politically correct. Yes, let's discuss it. Let's talk about it over the next 10 years. No, no, no, no. We saved suburbia in the US. I got rid of a regulation that was a disaster. And it was very unfair. And you've been reading about it for a long time. It's been going on for a long time. It became much worse under Obama and Biden. I got rid of it. And I had a choice. Even my own people said, \"You'd never get rid of it, sir.\" I said, \"I want to get rid of it.\" \"Well, why don't we just amend it?\" I said, \"I don't want to amend it. I want to get rid of it.\" Get rid of it. Okay? President Trump: (22:06)And I think we're going to see that the women really like Trump a lot. That's happened last time. Remember? Remember last four years ago? Four years ago, they said women will never vote for him. I said, \"Why, am I so bad?\" They said, \"The women will never vote.\" Then I got 52%. They said, \"What the hell happened with the women?\" Except this time, see, this is much easier. Because then I was a developer, I was doing great, everything was nice, but I had never done this before. I came in, I said, \"I'm going to rebuild our military. I'm going to cut your taxes. I'm going to cut your regulations. I'm going to get you this, I'm going to get you that. I'm going to take care of our vets.\" President Trump: (22:42)I mean, I did things that frankly, I never even talked about like space force. I never talked about space force. The wall is almost built. You know, the wall is up to 392 miles. It's almost built. And Mexico is paying for the wall by the way, you know that. I've been saying it. They hate to hear that, but they're paying. We're putting a charge on where the cars go through and it will more than pay for the wall. But we have now the most secure Southern border that we've ever had. And I want to thank the president of Mexico. They 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border, stopping people from coming into the US illegally. Thank you very much. President Trump: (23:24)No, but we did all these things. So this time in theory, it should be easier. But don't forget, I've gone through years of a fake witch hunt. And now it turned out that they were the guilty party. They were the ones dealing with Russia. They were the guilty people. Think if I didn't have every night on that fake CNN, right over there with the light on. The light just went off. It just went off. Every time I point to them, the light goes off. It's all right, keep it off. Nobody's watching them anyway. President Trump: (23:56)But think if I didn't have every night, Russia, Russia, Russia, hey. And nobody's been tougher on Russia than me. What I've done for NATO. Raised $130 billion a year from other countries that weren't paying their bills. They were delinquent, as we said in the real estate business. They were delinquent. And that goes up to $410 billion. Nobody did that. Obama used to send them pillows maybe from the pillow man on Fox. Did you ever see a man advertised so much? I've never seen it. I've never seen the biggest advertising I think he's the greatest advertising genius, Mike. If I gave him our budget, you wouldn't be able to do anything else but watch Trump ads. The pillow, man. I tell you, I never saw so many ads in my life. Every day, it's a pillow, the pillow. Now he came out with a sheet and I'm going crazy. That's all we need now is a new sheet. But he's on our side too by the way, that guy, he's on our side, Mike. President Trump: (24:57)And now Biden even refuses to answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. You know, elections have consequences. Winning and losing an election, that's big consequences. And we've been winning elections. And they say, \"Well, you know, Trump shouldn't be appointing the new justice because \" well, I'm president. In fact, as you know, a lot of your great justices said, \"No, no they're appointed.\" Justice Ginsburg just said recently, not so long ago, \"No, no. He's a president for four years. Not for three years. You appoint \" Now, she was referring to Obama, I think, or Clinton or somebody. But wasn't referring to me, I can promise you that. President Trump: (25:44)Oh, don't worry. Don't worry. It's being filled. You don't have to worry about that. That's much easier than we'll build a wall that goes to that goes for a lot. You know, the wall is one of the biggest projects in the history of this country. You know that right? And we had a party dedicated to the proposition that there will never, ever be a wall. They know was the right thing to do. And I made one big mistake. I should've come instead of saying, \"We will build a wall,\" I should have said, \"We will never, ever build a wall.\" They would have given me so much money. Made a big mistake. All great congressman over there. Are you guys having a good time, by the way? Huh, Mike? President Trump: (26:22)He said the voters don't deserve to know. And they'll tell you after the election what he's going to do. And you know what I did, I gave you a list. I have 45 people on that list. Every one of them is a star. And I gave you a list. Yeah, sit down, everybody. Just enjoy yourself. What the hell? Look at these people. I didn't even realize you're all standing. I didn't realize you had seats. You're lucky. This is one of the few crowds we provided seats. That's because it's Pennsylvania, I guess. It's pretty good. President Trump: (26:56)If they win, Democrats will pack the Supreme Court with radical left justices who will shred your Second Amendment. You can forget about guns, empower violent mobs, and shield deadly criminals and terrorists. To defend our constitution from this madness, I proudly nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the United States Supreme Court and to the court. She'll be a great justice of the United States Supreme Court. She's done so well. I really found it fascinating today. I don't have too much time, but I tried to watch as much as I could. She was great. President Trump: (27:32)The radical left is hellbent on destroying everything we love and cherish. They're enraged and unhinged. And they are going crazy. Think of it, very many presidents never have anybody to appoint. I will have by the end of the first term, almost 300 federal judges and three Supreme Court justices. Their heads are exploding. I hope they're happy. President Trump: (28:02)They want to cancel you, shame you, and persecute you. That's what they want to do. They want to shame. And this whole cancel culture thing. Now they're after Abraham Lincoln. They don't like Abraham Lincoln. No, he wasn't too good was he? I said this three years ago. Remember when they took down a couple of statues of people you'd never heard of? A Confederate soldier, somebody else, somebody I said, \"Oh, really? Then next will be Robert E. Lee. Then next will be Abraham Lincoln. Then next will be George Washington.\" And everybody laughed. They said, \"Oh, the president is so funny.\" I said, \"I'm not being funny. These people are sick.\" These people, they want to take away your heritage. And by the way, are there any Italians in the room? President Trump: (28:43)Okay, well, we are protecting the legacy of Christopher Columbus. The Italians are tough. I love the Italians. So they were going to rip down the statue of Christopher Columbus in New York. You saw that, right? And all of a sudden, a group of Italian circled around the statue and they were having pretty tough things in their hand, I must say. And it was amazing how those people that wanted to rip it down disappeared very quickly. So the Italians, let me tell you, Christopher Columbus will always be here on my watch, that I can tell you. President Trump: (29:21)I had people the other day that wanted to wish me Happy Columbus Day. They were afraid. I said, \"Why are you ashamed? No, no, say it. Happy Christopher Columbus Day.\" This is Christopher Columbus Day. It's Columbus Day.\" So Italians say, \"Thank you Mr. President.\" I appreciate it. I like you too. I love the Italians. They want to punish the middle-class, expunged every last trace of traditional values, and replace the American dream with the socialist nightmare. And that's what would happen. Just take a look at what's going on in other parts of the world. President Trump: (29:52)Biden's agenda, not that he has one, but you know. He does whatever they tell him to do. He got so lucky. She should have gotten out. She was faithful, she would have gotten out. Bernie would have run. We would have been running against crazy Bernie instead. But I'd rather run against Joe because there's no enthusiasm. There's no energy. One thing with Bernie's people And you know, we got a lot of people last time from Bernie because they loved me on trade, because they know our country has been ripped off on trade like no country has ever been ripped off. And Bernie's people get that. And they like us on trade. President Trump: (30:27)Biden's agenda would be a catastrophe for seniors. For years, Biden tried to cut social security and Medicare. Nobody remembers that. And the press will never bring it up. But he tried to cut your social security. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal health care for the illegal aliens, decimating Medicare and destroying your social security. Biden cares more about illegal aliens than he cares about your senior citizens and it's true. And let me just tell you this. And I say it strongly, and when I first got elected, they always played the social security card. And nothing happened. Your social security now is better than ever. I haven't touched it. While I am president, no one will touch your Medicare or your social security. Under my leadership, we're delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery. If you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, that's what we want. Normal life. We want normal life. We'll fully resume. And next year will be one of the greatest economic years in the history of our country. It's already happening. President Trump: (31:40)How about the stock market? Who has 401ks in the audience? Well, I can tell you one thing, I'm getting all of your votes. I'm getting your votes. Your 401ks is setting records. Think of it, as we're rounding the turn and we are, they go crazy when I say we're rounding the turn on the pandemic. We understand it. Hey, I just had it. Here I am. It's actually me. President Trump: (32:01)And I could've stayed in the basement of the White House or maybe the top floor of the White House. I could have done that, but I'm the president of the United States. I can't do that. I got to get out and I have to meet people and I have to see people. And I know it's risky to do that, but you have to do what you have to do. I'm the president. I can't sit in the basement and say, \"Let's wait this thing out.\" I'm not going to do that. And now I'm immune, they tell me I'm immune. I could come down and start kissing everybody. I'll kiss every guy, man and woman, man and woman. Look at that guy, how handsome he is. I'll kiss him. Not with all of enjoyment, but that's okay. President Trump: (32:42)Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate the economy with draconian, unscientific lockdowns, like you're having right now in Pennsylvania with this governor who is killing you. Tom Wolf, Tom Wolf. Come on, Tom. Open up Pennsylvania, Tom. Open it up. You know what's going to happen? November 4th, they'll open it up. You know that? They want to keep the numbers as bad as possible. President Trump: (33:15)Here's the problem. The numbers are going to come out just before the election. So we have November 3rd, the numbers are going to come out. And Pennsylvania is a late voting state. You actually believe in going to a poll because you see all the shenanigans. No, you're a late voting state. And all I can tell you is when I came here and I said this before, but when I came here, I promise you a lot of things. I've done much more than I promised you. You've had the best year you've ever had, and you're going to have a better year next year. You damn well better vote for me, Pennsylvania. You better vote for me. President Trump: (33:53)Sleepy Joe Biden's plan will crush America. And my plan, we're going to crush the virus very quickly. It's happening already. It's happening. Almost 90% less mortality. You know, the mortality rate is at like 85. If you had it seven or eight months ago, it was not as good as if you have it now. And soon it's going to be perfecto. And I said that the drug that they gave me, we're going to be distributing it all over the country to hospitals and everything else, because I'll tell you that sucker works. That's my opinion. What do I know? But to me it works. President Trump: (34:29)And the people that did it. They're phenomenal people. They've had great success with other vaccines and drugs. Just this week, we learned that another member of the Biden family is getting rich off connections to Joe. His son-in-law, just came out, big story, is cashing in on the China virus pandemic, just like Hunter. Where's Hunter? Crashed in on China. What do you think when Hunter walks in and he walks out with a billion and a half dollars to manage for China. I said to a friend of mine, one of the biggest guys on Wall Street, \"Does that ever happened?\" He said, \"I'm the biggest guy on Wall Street. That doesn't happen for me.\" 10 minutes, he had a billion and a half dollars. Maybe he's not so stupid after all. President Trump: (35:10)To fight the China virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II. And we really should get credit for what we've done, because I'll tell you Mike pats and all of these people, they have worked 24 hours around the clock. Our early and aggressive action saved as many as 2 million lives. Remember when they said, \"No, no, no. You don't want to ban China. Don't ban China.\" I did it in January. They were talking a month and a half later, we shouldn't be doing it. He called me xenophobic. President Trump: (35:38)I said, \"Joe, give me a definition of xenophobic, please.\" He was unable to do that. We pioneered lifesaving therapies and reduced the fatality rate by 85%. I'm working with the FDA to make the antibody treatments I received. And everybody we're going to have them. They're going to be shipped very soon. We're working on an emergency use authorization, very complicated stuff. And the President Trump: (36:03)Use authorization, very complicated stuff, and the FDA has never responded like they've responded to me. This could have taken years what we've done and we've done it in weeks. I know they came to me on one thing and they said, \"Sir, well that will take approximately two and a half years.\" I said, \"No, it's no good.\" \"When do you need it, sir?\" \"Next week? Tomorrow? How about tomorrow?\" No, we're pushing them hard. The FDA has been great. To everyone fighting to recover from the virus, I feel your pain because I felt your pain and we will beat this virus together. Who has had it? Who has had it here? Who's had it? Yeah. A lot of people, a lot of people. Well, you're the people I want to say hello to because you are right now immune. You are right now immune. President Trump: (36:49)Or they say that. You know, they hate to admit it because I had it. So in the old days they said, \"Well, if you have it, you're immune for life,\" right? Once I got it, they give you four months. It's anybody else but me, you're immune for life. Through operation warp speed, which is incredible, we'll have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year, 100 million, and the vaccine will end the pandemic once and for all. President Trump: (37:16)And remember this because I have the endorsement of, I think, every major law enforcement and minor law enforcement group in the country. We have a lot of Democrats that left their party and they came over, law enforcement people. I can almost tell you by looking. Look at this group over here. I know the law enforcement people. Nobody's been better. We had all this surplus military equipment. Obama didn't want to give it out because he said it looked too militaristic. I said, \"No, I want to save lives. Okay?\" It's defensive equipment. I want to save lives. And we gave out hundreds of millions of It was sitting in warehouses all over the country, military equipment, and we gave it out. But there's nobody like the great men and women of law enforcement. Nobody. President Trump: (38:06)Look at that. Whoa. Whoa. See? They love you. See that? Wow. I didn't expect that. That's pretty good. Audience: (38:16)USA! USA! USA! USA! President Trump: (38:25)That's great. But this election is about law and order. You look at Portland. We keep saying to the governor, \"Look, governor, Oregon.\" I said, \"Governor, let us go in. We'll solve the problem in 30 minutes.\" They don't want to do that. You know, they're supposed to ask you to come in. We did a great job in Minnesota, Minneapolis, except you know, instead of 10 days, they could have called us like two hours later. But they came in and they lined up and they were not socially distanced. They lined up. You saw that. They came in wearing black uniforms, 250, 000 and most expensive uniforms. I never saw so many computers on a helmet. But they went in and they had their tear gas and they had their pepper spray, which the other side doesn't want us to use anymore. They said, \"No, we don't want to do that.\" President Trump: (39:14)These people are a lot of bad people out there. You know, they're anarchists, radical, left anarchists. Okay? So they came in. They came in. You saw it. There was one person. I said, \"Where are the rest?\" Then another one. Then another one. Then they started getting off buses, wherever. All of a sudden, you had one line, two line, and they just started moving forward. That was the end of the problem. It ended within 30 minutes. It was over. It was over. And we'll do it wherever they want us. We'd love to go into Portland because those guys are bad news. You saw we sent in the U.S. Marshals, right? Because one man, horrible guy, shot somebody right through the head, shot him in the middle of the street. A guy who wasn't hurting anybody. He killed him. Two days went by. Three days went by. I said, \"Why the hell haven't they arrested him?\" And they knew who he was. And we sent in the U.S. Marshals. And in 15 minutes it was all over. That was the end of it. That was the end of it. President Trump: (40:12)Biden Harris and the Democrat party declared war on our police. Okay? And we've proudly received the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association. Wow. The Fraternal Order of Police including those in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Scranton and virtually every single police organization that we know. President Trump: (40:45)And during the debate, I asked sleepy Joe, I said, \"ive me one organization, law enforcement, that's endorsing you.\" And he couldn't do it. Then Chris Wallace saved him. Then I said, remember I said, \" Sir, tell me, say the words law and order. Say it, Joe. Say it.\" He couldn't do it. He wouldn't do it. He wouldn't do it. Because you know what? Because he'd been run out of his party if he said the words law and order. Then I think at the end, didn't he say like law, and order, and safety, and justice, and you know, all the stuff. No, no. Law and order. Say law and order, Joe. He couldn't do it. President Trump: (41:21)So we're joined tonight by some real warriors, warriors of a different type, political warriors. They're okay too, right? And they're friends of mine. They're great people. Representative John Joyce. John, please. A guy has been around a long time and he fights like hell, G.T. Thompson. G.T., thank you. Great. Be careful with your election. I hear you're only up 40 points, G.T. Another one is only up about 44 points, a really good friend of mine and he's tough as hell, Mike Kelly. I say G.T., Mike, you need any help, I'll come and help you. The say, \"No, sir, we don't really need help. Don't worry about it.\" A friend of mine and a great gentleman, and he was the first one that predicted that I was going to win this thing. I'll tell you, former Congressman Lou Barletta. Thank you, Lou. Thank you, Lou. How are we doing, Lou? Are we doing okay? How do we compare to four years ago? Better. Okay, good. He said the right thing. Anyway, yeah, I think a lot better, because we produced. Again, four years ago. I said we're going to do things. Now we've done them all plus additional things, I mean a lot of additional things. I never talked about Space Force. We did Space Force. You know, somebody did Space Force. That's like a major achievement for four years. That's one thing. That's like one thing out of so many other things. So it's one of those things, but I never used to talk about that. President Trump: (42:55)And former chair of the Pennsylvania Republican party, a friend of mine, the guy that knows more about Pennsylvania than any human being on earth, Rob Gleason. Rob, thank you. How are we doing Rob? Good? Okay, good. He said to me another group came down. They didn't want his advice. They came down from Boston and they put events all over the place and he said, \"You're going to the wrong location.\" Anyway, they ended up losing big. Right? But with us, we came to Rob. We say, where do you think the best places are? And we hit. And we agreed with you too. But Rob Gleason has been a fantastic friend. Thank you, Rob, very much for being here. I appreciate it. President Trump: (43:33)And with their help and your help, we are delivering for the American people like never before. Nobody's ever done what we've done in three and a half years. No administration's ever done this the first three and a half years. In my first three years in office, family income increased by $6,000 and that doesn't include energy, which I think you could double it up. More than five times the gains in all eight years of the Obama administration. African American income grew nine times more than it did under the last administration. Think of it. African American income grew nine, not two, not three, nine times more, and these are out of the book. These numbers are out of the book. Real well for the bottom. 50% grew nearly twice as fast as it grew for the top. 1% Hispanic family net worth increased by 64% in a short period of time, 64. President Trump: (44:40)We added nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs and we added 15,000 factories, and Obama said \"You'll never produce manufacturing jobs.\" Remember? You need a magic wand. Well, we found the magic wand. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty including over 1 million African Americans, and more than 1.5 million Hispanic Americans. And we're doing great with both groups and we love them. We love both groups. Thank you. Those are great numbers. After our tax cuts took effect, wages for the lowest income Americans grew twice as fast as those near the top. Think of that. You never hear that stuff. The big beneficiary were lowest income Americans. My policies have benefited those who need it the most. After the virus came in from China and we had to change. We had to do things. This came out. It was a sudden horrible thing. China should have never, ever let it happen. They should have never let it happen. President Trump: (45:44)We've seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation by far, and we've seen by far the fastest recovery of any nation. In the past five months, we've created a record 11.4 million jobs, that's American jobs. That's the fastest ever recorded. Job growth has been 23 times faster than the first five months. Think of this. For the first five months of the Obama Biden recovery, 23 times. We cut unemployment rate in half. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half the jobs lost to the crisis. We did it in five months. So we're talking about numbers that nobody can even believe. Homebuilder confidence has reached an all time high. We're in a pandemic. Reached an all-time high. Manufacturing optimism has doubled. Consumer confidence, which just came out, has surged nearly 20%, and small business confidence is now higher than any time in the entire decade proceeding my election. Think of that. And we're rounding the turn on our pandemic. President Trump: (47:05)We've spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. He made every bad deal in the book. And by the way, if you look at the H1N1, you know, he calls it the N1H1, right? I said, \"No, no. H. Here's the way you remember it, Joe. H comes before I.\" And he goes, \"The N1H1, whatever it's called. What was his name again? Or the Senator? Maybe he was a governor.\" Yeah, Romney. Romney. \"Oh, that's right. It was Romney.\" It's amazing. You know, amazing. And he gets away with that stuff. You only see it. You only see it on the internet. They never report it. They never report it. They should report it. They're doing this country a great disservice by not reporting it. But Biden supported NAFTA, TPP, and China's entry into the WTO, which is one of the worst things that ever happened to this country. President Trump: (47:59)For half a century, Biden twisted his blade into the heart of the American worker. He should not be asking for your vote. You should be begging for your forgiveness. He did a rotten job. Okay? Did a rotten job. For decades our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we're finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong. Audience: (48:35)USA! USA! USA! USA! President Trump: (48:53)Almost done. Syria, we're gone, except we kept the oil. Does anybody mind that I kept the oil? So we left some troops behind to keep the oil. With Iraq, we're almost out. With Afghanistan, 19 years in Afghanistan, 19 years, and we're really serving as policemen. It's great to be policemen, but they got to have their own policemen. They got to do it themselves. But we're, we're bringing them home. We're down to a very few number of soldiers. President Trump: (49:22)To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the last administration's transpacific partnership disaster. It would have been a disaster. Would have destroyed your automobile industry and others. To defend our steel and aluminum workers, I imposed historic tariffs on dumped goods. Remember when they were dumping steel all over the place? You guys were getting killed. Saving those industries from total destruction. And frankly had the plague not came in from China, but now they're doing well, anyway, had that not come in, you would have had a steel industry that would have been at a level that nobody's ever seen before. But it came in, but you're going to be there anyway in a short period of time, unless some stupid person comes along and raises your taxes by four times what they should be, which is what they want to do. President Trump: (50:07)I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA into law. Everyone said that was going to be impossible to do. And I withdrew from the job killing Paris Climate Accord. So nice of them to tell us that we can't use our energy. That was an accord. You know what that was going to? Destroy our country. That's what that was going to do. If you look at what has happened over the last very short period of time, the progress that this nation has made, you're not even going to believe it and you're going to see it. And you would have seen it had the plague not come in because it was all happening. We were at every single record, but now we're getting close anyway. The jobs are all coming back and the market is almost going to be topping the market from before the plague. And it's pretty amazing. I will tell you. President Trump: (50:54)Biden has vowed to rejoin this horrible agreement, a death sentence for your state's energy industry, The Paris Accord. It's a terrible thing. Unlike Biden, I know my job is to represent Pennsylvania, not Paris. We're representing Pennsylvania, not Paris. Got a lot of nice people. They can represent Paris. President Trump: (51:18)I took the toughest ever action to confront China's rampant theft of American jobs. You know that. We charged them so much. We gave a lot of the money to our farmers, $28 billion to our farmers because our farmers were targeted. Everybody get your money. They did better without even growing anything, to be honest. But we got it from China, $28 billion, and we had a lot left over that went into the treasury of the United States. To defend American workers, earlier today I also signed an order to crack down on Chinese counterfeiters and merchants who sell their fake products all over the United States. They put the name Tiffany, Tiffany. It's got the blue box, everything. Tiffany, Tiffany, Tiffany. Isn't that wonderful? But it wasn't made by Tiffany. President Trump: (52:05)Biden will eliminate my tariffs on China. He's already said he's going to take the tariffs off China. There goes your steel industry. There goes your aluminum industry. That goes everything. Allowing them to plunder without consequence. The one constant in Biden's platform is surrender. He surrenders. He surrenders whether it's a China, whether it's Cuba. How about Cuba? How about the deal they made with Cuba? How bad was that one? I ended it. That's why both China and the far left are desperate for a Biden win because he will surrender our jobs to China. China will own the United States if that sleepy guy gets the position. Okay? And you can forget about Pennsylvania. And you know, don't also forget, your streets will be surrendered to the mob. You know, Republican areas are great. They're doing great. The crime is at record lows, everything else. These are the Democrats, super liberal Democrat areas. President Trump: (53:06)Unlike sleepy Joe Biden, I will never abandon our nation and I will never abandon its values. My goal is not to make friends in the D.C. swamp. My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family. President Trump: (53:25)In 2017, I proudly signed a historic executive order making it official government policy to buy American and hire American. My opponent has put forward a radical plan to eliminate U.S. borders by implementing catch and release programs. And I ended. You know what catch and release is? You catch a murderer, you catch a rapist coming across our border, and you release him. Catch, catch him and release him. And you say, \"I'm sorry. Three years from now, please come back for a court case.\" Nobody comes back. Impose- President Trump: (54:03)Please come back for a court case. Nobody comes back. Imposing deadly sanctuary cities and suspending all removals. They don't want any removals. This is what Biden agreed to with crazy Bernie Sanders. When you have people that are in this country illegally, even if they're murderers, if they're rapists, no matter what they are, you can't remove them. We've removed tens of thousands of people including MS-13. President Trump: (54:28)It would mean the total nullification of US borders overwhelming every city and town in America, and especially in a place like Pennsylvania. Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your healthcare is gone, the middle class is gone and your safety is gone. Other than that, you'll be doing very nicely. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we're finishing that wall. It's going to be built very soon. It's going to be finished. We're going to have the greatest celebration. That was a tough one. That was a tough one. Remember they said, \"We don't need a wall.\" They wanted drones, drones flying around looking at the people pouring across the border. They wanted drones. They wanted modern technology. You know what I've said often, right? There were two things that will always be around in a thousand years, in 2000 years, all new computers, all new everything. You come up with a new computer. You come up with a new chip. Three days later, it's obsolete. I would not want to be in that business, but there are two things, a wall and a wheel right? A wall and a wheel. In a thousand years, 2000 years, it's going to be here. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in more than 75 years, Space Force. President Trump: (55:54)For our great vets. We pass VA choice and VA accountability. Nobody thought would ever get that done. We killed the leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi, and we took down 100% of the ISIS caliphate. And when I took over, that caliphate was all over the place. It was a mess. We took down the world's number one terrorist and the mass murder of many American troops, many troops, many people all over the world. Qasem Soleimani is dead. Thank you. He's dead. President Trump: (56:37)I withdrew from the last administration's disaster, Iran nuclear deal. One of the worst deals I've ever seen. That's John Kerry, the guy was totally incompetent. That guy didn't know what the hell he was doing. He gave him $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash for nothing. I kept my promise, recognize the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, I've been trying to get that. And instead of endless war, we're forging peace in the Middle East, you see the deals we made? I actually got nominated for a Nobel Peace prize. The press didn't cover it, but that's okay. President Trump: (57:22)The press didn't cover it. I got nominated for three Nobel Peace prizes. I did more in 47 months in Joe Biden did in 47 years and that's true. Now Biden is pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. He's going to ruin your energy. He's going to ruin your state. The Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions because there's no money. Biden's running mates sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance. We have 180 million people with great private plans. They want to keep it that way. They're going to outlaw. They're going to get rid of them. President Trump: (58:15)Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on Jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions by more than 700%. he agreed to this. He said, \"That's okay. Let them come in. I got the ban right? Remember the ban. Remember who's a big deal. I got the ban. I said, \"If it's okay, we have unfriendly countries. If it's all right with you, they're not coming into our country. I got the ban. We won in the Supreme court, five to four. I got the ban.\" He wants to give up the ban. He wants to let people pour into our country. 700% increase opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. I don't want to speak too much. Made of wood. This is real wood. I don't want to speak too much, but you haven't seen too many things happening lately have you? He'll ban school choice, charter schools and Pennsylvania opportunity scholarships. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. It's so important. President Trump: (59:15)A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans and in conclusion and I love being back with you in Pennsylvania. So many incredible memories really. So many. What a night that was. Remember that night? Donald Trump has won the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Donald Trump. Remember how late? They just didn't want to call it. They didn't want to call it. I said, \"Call it already.\" We were at 98%. We were substantially ahead. If I lost every single vote, we still won. It took him like till two o'clock in morning before they called it. In the meantime, Wisconsin came in and Michigan came in, but they just refused to call Pennsylvania. They just couldn't. Remember them crying and they were all stirred up. President Trump: (01:00:08)Over the next four years. We'll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we'll end our reliance on China once and for all. That's already happening. We'll hire more police, increased penalties for assault on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities that people don't want. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment. We'll strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign ridiculous wars. We will maintain America's unrivaled military mind and we will ensure peace through strength. President Trump: (01:01:03)And by the way, we've rebuilt our military. I told you $2.5 trillion. We have weapons and equipment, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are the envy of Russia. We are the envy of China. We are the envy of everybody. There is no country that has what we have. And I will tell you when I first came here, one of our generals highly overrated said to me, \"Sir, we have no ammunition.\" That's where we started. And now we have the greatest weapons anywhere in the world. And just hope to God, we never have to use them. President Trump: (01:01:39)We will then surprise medical building, require price transparency which is already signed January 1, it kicks in, and further reduce the costs of prescription drugs. And I'm talking about 50, 60, 70, 80% because of what I've done with favored nations, getting the lowest price Mike, the whole world. We're going down. We're taking these nations. They pay a fraction of what we pay. I said, \"Nope, whatever they pay, I want to pay.\" Why are we paying more than any other nation? We're the highest. We're going down to match the lowest. The drug companies don't love me too much just in case you haven't heard. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security. We'll always protect patients with pre existing conditions. President Trump: (01:02:24)America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and we're very close. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania. It's very important. So get your friends. Most important election we've ever had. Get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote. You got to get out and vote like you'd never voted before. President Trump: (01:03:39)Places that we won like Erie. Places that we won, you got to get out and vote because from Erie to Easton, from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg and from Allentown to right here in Johnstown, we stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence. Think of what you have in Pennsylvania. Who can say that? This is it. What you've done here, what the history of this incredible place, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, think of what you've done. President Trump: (01:04:23)It's where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge and General George Washington Don't worry. His statues are not coming down. Led his man on a daring mission across the Delaware and where our nation was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg. This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mine the coal, work the railroads, and forge the steel, that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And you have seen nothing yet. Wait till you see what we're doing. We are making our country greater than ever before. President Trump: (01:05:12)Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And when you're great Congressman to come to see me, right? It's great. What a group of warriors. I don't know with them. I'm not sure I can handle that group, but when they come in to see me in the Oval Office, they say, \"Mr. President, Pennsylvania is not used to winning this much. We got to slow it down a little bit.\" President Trump: (01:05:57)And I'll say, \"Mike, I'm sorry. Mike, you tell the rest of them Mike. We're not going to slow it down at all.\" Pennsylvania wants to win more than anybody in this country wants to win. Pennsylvania is going to win. We're never going to stop. We're going to keep on winning. We're going to win so much you're going to love every moment of that era. And you know what? You lost long enough. I can tell you that. Many years where your factories in your plants left because we have stupid leadership. Don't kid yourself. You lost for a long time. And now you're winning and you're winning like never before. Open it up Governor. Open it up. President Trump: (01:06:35)Because we're one movement, one family, one people, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again, and we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much Pennsylvania. Thank you. Get out and vote. Vote, vote, vote.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1477991\/donald-trump-rally-johnstown&speechType=6","Summary":"Elections","Source":null,"Location":"Johnstown, PA","Original source":"https:\/\/www.rev.com\/blog\/transcripts\/donald-trump-rally-johnstown-pa-transcript-october-13","CleanText":"President Trump: (01:02)Hello, Johnstown. Thank you very much. This is going to be a great evening. Incredible to be back in Pennsylvania, the proud home of American independence, the American constitution and American freedom. That's true. Huh? What a history. And 21 days days from now, we're going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we're going to win four more years in the White House. This election is a simple choice. If Biden wins, China wins, all these other countries win. We get ripped off by everybody. If we win, you win, Pennsylvania wins and America wins, very simple. For years, the selfish and corrupt political class betrayed the people of Pennsylvania, you know that, and the people of our country. Career politicians like Joe Biden lied to you. I don't think he knew he was even lying. You want to know the truth. He's gone. He's shot folks. I hate to tell you, he's shot. He abused you, he crushed you, your dreams and outsourced your jobs to China and distant lands all over the world. President Trump: (02:14)As a Senator Biden's last American trade policies were a total disaster. They dismantled your steel industry and decimated entire towns in your area. And we brought back steel and we put tariffs on steel and we stopped dumping steel and aluminum. As vice-president, he closed down 10,000 factories while raking in cash from corporations that moved jobs overseas, and his family got rich. You know that. President Trump: (02:48)How did Hunter make three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Russia, mayor of Moscow's wife? How did that happen? So you have the mayor of Moscow, got a wife, gave Hunter three and a half million bucks. I wonder what he did for that money, huh? The fake news, they refused to talk about it. They don't want to hear about it. President Trump: (03:09)Biden's a servant of the radical globalist, the wealthy donors, the big money special interests, who shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories and you know it, because you really suffered right in this area, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in these ridiculous, endless foreign wars. They're all coming back home. Don't worry. They're all coming back home, soon. They're already on their way. They've been on their way for a long time. President Trump: (03:42)In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this failed and decrepit political establishment. And you elected an outsider as your president to finally put America first. That's what we did. And we did not come this far, overcome this much, and fight this hard only to surrender our country back to the depraved, Washington swamp. And by the way, did we catch them? We caught them. We caught them. We caught them. Watch what happens. Watch what happens. They spied on our campaign. What they did should never, ever be allowed to happen in this country again, never. Watch what happens. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party's nomination. He has handed control to the socialists and Marxists and left-wing extremists like his vice presidential candidate. That's another great one, isn't it? President Trump: (04:52)I just watched her on television coming in, because the great thing about Air Force One, we have more televisions. They're in closets. They're all over the place. They're on the floors, on the ceilings. And I watched her and I compared her to Amy, great future Supreme court justice. And I will tell you Amy's made a great impression. Crowd: (05:18)Fill that seat. Fill that seat. Fill that seat. President Trump: (05:29)And you know, Biden, he can't stand up to the lunatics running his party. He can't even find his way off the stage without them. Look what's happened. Yesterday, he didn't know the name. He said, 'You know the guy, I think he's a Mormon, right' He said, 'He's a Mormon.' He was talking about Mitt Romney. He forgot Mitt Romney's name. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine. Then he didn't know where he was. He said, 'Where the hell am I? Where am I?' No, he's shot folks. He's shot. President Trump: (05:58)I'm running against the single worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. And you know what that does? That puts more pressure on me. Can you imagine if you lose to a guy like this? It's unbelievable. It's disgusting. It's disgraceful. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country. He won't be running the country. The radical left will take over. President Trump: (06:22)And how about Pennsylvania? So he says, 'There will be no fracking, no fracking.' This went on for a year and a half. No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. Then Elizabeth Warren refused to get out. So they stole another one for Bernie. Bernie is the greatest loser of them all. This guy, every four years they steal it. So she refused to get out, Pocahontas. She refused to get out. They wanted me to apologize for saying the word Pocahontas. So no, no. I apologize to Pocahontas, . No, no, she wouldn't get out. And she took enough votes away and Biden won super Tuesday. That shouldn't have happened. President Trump: (07:03)But if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, fortunately that's because I'm not a politician. I'm not a politician. But think of that, you talk about politician, no fracking for a year and a half, right? And then he goes to Pennsylvania says, 'No, no, there'll be fracking.' Like nothing happened. Can you imagine if I did that? No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. I'm the opposite, by the way. No fracking, no fracking. Then you win and you go, I've got to go a little to the other direction, a little bit to the right. Although he actually went further to the left, which is sort of an amazing thing, but all of a sudden he comes out in favor of fracking. President Trump: (07:42)And let me tell you, it's always the first thing that turns out to be true. Okay. They will lose, you will lose, in Pennsylvania a million jobs. There will be no petroleum products. There will be no fracking whatsoever. And did you see his party now is really angry at him because he's saying maybe there'll be fracking. It's a very conditional, it's a very weak, but with me, you're going to frack. You're going to frack. And you're going to keep your energy low. And we're independent, we are now energy independent, first time ever. President Trump: (08:16)So if I don't always play by the rules of the Washington establishment it's because I was elected to fight for you. And I fought harder for you than any president has ever fought for their people. Right now I'm fighting to eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. And that's a big thing, saving it, because these people, this will end up being a large scale version of Venezuela, if they get in. They don't have water. They don't have medicine. They don't have food. They don't have anything. Despite everything they've thrown at us, we've done more in the first three and a half years than any administration in history. And the best is yet to come. That's true. President Trump: (09:06)A recent Gallup poll just came out. Crowd: (09:08)Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. President Trump: (09:21)Thank you. A Gallup poll just came out that found that 56% of Americans say they're better off today than they were under Sleepy Joe and Obama. That's the highest of any president at this point in his term. Let's think of that, 56%. This is as we round the corner on the pandemic, 56%. they were much, much lower. Just remember this, if they were any good I wouldn't have run for president, but they were no good. They did a horrible job. They did a horrible job. President Trump: (09:56)Yesterday, Biden told those 56% of Americans that they probably shouldn't vote for him. And for once I agree with Joe. Did you hear? He said, 'You shouldn't vote for me.' He has no idea what he's saying. How the hell do you lose to a guy like this? Is this possible. Oh, I'll never come to Pennsylvania again. I love this place. They say he was born in Scranton, but he left. He left. He abandoned you. Give me a break. Crowd: (10:27)We love you. We love you. We love you. President Trump: (10:34)Thank you. Crowd: (10:34)We love you. President Trump: (10:34)I love you, too. Crowd: (10:34)We love you. We love you. We love you. President Trump: (10:38)Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. By the way, there's a lot of people here tonight. Got a lot of people. I wish the fake news would show it. They never turn the cameras. I go home, our great first lady always says, 'How was the crowd?' I said, 'Didn't they show it?' 'No, they just show your face.' And about five people behind me, right? They become famous. Why don't you show the crowd though? Why don't you do yourself a favor, show the crowd. President Trump: (11:18)One of the most important issues for Pennsylvania is the survival of your fracking industry. Joe Biden has repeatedly pledged to abolish fracking. He's a liar. Okay. He's a liar. How do you do it? How do you do it? He went for a year and a half. They said, 'Are you ' remember the debates with the radical left Democrats? You had Alfred E Newman. You had all these people, you know who Alfred E. Newman is? Yes. Pete Buttigieg, Pete Buttigieg, he was a bad mayor of a failed town and he's going to run for president. Pete Buttigieg, but you know he's talking about it. And does that mean everybody, nobody is going to do fracking? That's right. Nobody. Nobody, I swear. Nobody, nobody, nobody. Then he gets up, I've never seen anything like it in my life, and not one fake reporter back there said, 'Well, wait a minute, you've been pledging for a year and a half, no fracking.' President Trump: (12:14)But then what about the healthcare for illegal immigrants? Who in this group is going to provide healthcare for illegal immigrants? Everybody raises their hand. You remember Joe? No, do you remember? This is a famous clip, but they don't ask him questions about it because they're fake. You remember Joe? Who is going to provide And look, we all have hearts and we want to take care of everybody. But you know the problem when you do that, we don't have the money. The whole world is going to empty out into our country. They're going to come for healthcare. They're going to come for college, free college. I say sometimes jokingly sarcastically, 'Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce.' To which CNN says, 'They don't get a free Rolls-Royce. He has misrepresented.' President Trump: (12:57)These people are sick. Crowd: (13:07)CNN sucks. CNN Sucks. CNN sucks. CNN Sucks. CNN sucks. CNN Sucks. President Trump: (13:08)Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce. They don't get a free Rolls-Royce. The president has misrepresented. They are sick people. But think of it, so remember when Joe and they said, 'Raise your hand if everybody's in favor of free, everything, credit free everything, but free healthcare for illegal aliens.' And Joe goes like, he had no idea what the hell he was doing, folks. He has no clue. And he's not a nice guy. Just so you understand, not a nice guy. If he was a nice guy, I wouldn't hit him like this, but he's not a nice guy. He's a bad guy. He's always been a dummy. He's never been No, no. In his best of years, he was considered a dumb guy. When asked about fracking, Biden said he 'would sure, absolutely make it. We will eliminate it.' That's what he said. Those are the exact words. And then he said it 19 different times. President Trump: (14:04)Then one day he said, 'I never said that.' It's incredible. And they don't question him. I couldn't get away with it for a minute, not for a minute. Did you see the town hall he had with NBC? That was a town hall for a child, a young child. Barron Trump, and actually Barron's far too advanced for that town hall. That was a town hall, Lester Holt, Lester Holt. That was a beauty, right? That was some town hall. And they said, 'Yes, we have a random sampling of people.' Yeah. All Trump haters. What a group of people. But he raised his hand. He said, 'Illegal immigrants will get healthcare.' Now people don't realize what that means. That means your social security goes down the tubes, your country goes bankrupt. The whole thing is a disaster, but he raised his hand. Now he's trying to say he didn't do it. And they don't call him out because they're fake. President Trump: (15:04)His radical left running mate, who I just watched on television, she is so pathetic, is a co-sponsor of the socialist green new deal, which eliminates all fossil fuels. She's having a hard time getting out of that one. Did you hear the other day? She actually came out in favor of fracking. It was like, 'Yeah, I think so.' She's further left than Bernie. Did you see Bernie, I thought was the furthest left in the Senate, because you don't get too much worse. Then you go, instead of socialists, you go to the C-word, right? She's further left. She's considered further left than Bernie. When Nancy Pelosi does the 25th amendment, she's doing it for Biden. You do know that, right? Because they want to get Biden out and that won't be hard. But at this very moment, Biden's website includes a pledge to mandate net zero carbon emissions, which means fossil fuel, coal, everything is gone and it's gone soon. Okay. President Trump: (16:09)And with that goes our economy, and with that goes our country. The Democrat party hates fracking. They hate coal. They hate clean, beautiful coal. I see what they do with coal now. They hate domestic energy production and Biden will shut you down. He wants to shut you down just like your governor's got you shut down right now. They better open up your state. Did you see the World Health Organization yesterday? They said Trump was right. They said you can't make the cure worse than the problem itself. I've been saying that for a long time. And we did the right thing. We saved 2 million lives. They said 2.2 million people. We saved 2 million lives and we get nothing, and I'll tell you what, the vaccines are coming soon, the therapeutics and frankly, the cure. All I know is I took something, whatever the hell it was, I felt good very quickly. I don't know what it was. Antibodies, antibodies. I don't know. I took it. I said, I felt like Superman. And I said, 'Let me at them.' No, and I could have been here four or five days ago. It's great. We have great doctors. President Trump: (17:22)I want to thank the doctors at Walter Reed and Johns Hopkins, great doctors. One great thing about being president, if you're not feeling 100%, you have more doctors than you thought existed in the world. I was surrounded with 14 of them. Where are you from? 'I'm from this one.' Where are you from? 'I'm from Johns Hopkins.' 'I'm from Walter Reed.' But what great talented people. They did a great job and thank you. And while I'm president, America will remain the world's number one energy producer with Pennsylvania workers leading the way and that's what's happening. You're leading the way. President Trump: (18:00)You're leading . President Trump: (18:04)You know, you had the best year in the history of your place. It's a history of if you look at the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, you never want to say state. Don't ever say state. Actually, nobody cares but them, but you know. President Trump: (18:18)I'm just saying, let's say Pennsylvania, you got two of them. You know that, right? The Commonwealth, the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I went to school here. Probably spent more time here than sleepy Joe in all fairness, I went to school here. But we're putting our great coal miners back to work. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments. You see that happening. And we've got Did you see in the debate the other night, I said to him, 'Name one law enforcement agency, just one in a whole country that supports you.' He couldn't do it. Then Chris Wallace bailed him out. Then I say, 'How come you got the three and a half million from Russia?' And they bailed him out again. He was choking like a dog. They bailed him out. President Trump: (19:02)But they want to dissolve your borders. They don't want borders. They want to have open borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes, confiscate your guns, get rid of your Second Amendment. President Trump: (19:16)I mean, here's one that's incredible, destroy your suburbs. Okay, so they talk about the suburban women. And somebody said, 'I don't know if the suburban woman likes you.' I say, 'Why?' But we had this I love you too. President Trump: (19:34)They said, 'They may not like the way you talk,' but I'm about law and order. I'm about having you safe. I'm about having your suburban communities. I don't want to build low-income housing next to your house. Okay, if that's okay? And I ended the regulation, the rule that made the zoning so impossible that you had to destroy your communities. And then I hear the suburban woman. I think that the suburban woman, and I used to say suburban housewife, I used to take heat, but I said, 'Does anybody care?' Do you care? If I say suburb? No, they're all going to no. Again, the only one cares is them. 'Trump said suburban housewife,' but I didn't say it because I don't. You learn very quickly. You learn very quickly. But suburban women, they should like me more than anybody here tonight because I ended the regulation that destroyed your neighborhood. I ended the regulation that brought crime to the suburbs and you're going to live the American dream. And that's what you're going to do. President Trump: (20:31)And remember this, 29% of the people experiencing the American dream in the suburbs happened to be minority. And you don't know that. But 29%. and we're doing this for everybody. We're not doing it one way or the other. We're doing it. And I ended it. They said, 'Sir, we can amend it.' I said, 'I don't want to amend it. I want to end it.' It was a horror show. And this loser, Corey Booker is the guy that's going to be in charge of the program. The guy's a stone-cold loser. 1%, he got 1%. He ran. He was going to be great. You know, 1%. every week he was like her, down, down, down. They should've picked him. But no he'll be in charge of you're a suburban President Trump: (21:10)So can I ask you to do me a favor, suburban women, will you please like me? Please. Please. I saved your damn neighborhood, okay? The other thing I don't have that much time to be that nice. You know, I can do it, but I got to go quickly. We don't have time. They want me to be politically correct. Yes, let's discuss it. Let's talk about it over the next 10 years. No, no, no, no. We saved suburbia in the US. I got rid of a regulation that was a disaster. And it was very unfair. And you've been reading about it for a long time. It's been going on for a long time. It became much worse under Obama and Biden. I got rid of it. And I had a choice. Even my own people said, 'You'd never get rid of it, sir.' I said, 'I want to get rid of it.' 'Well, why don't we just amend it?' I said, 'I don't want to amend it. I want to get rid of it.' Get rid of it. Okay? President Trump: (22:06)And I think we're going to see that the women really like Trump a lot. That's happened last time. Remember? Remember last four years ago? Four years ago, they said women will never vote for him. I said, 'Why, am I so bad?' They said, 'The women will never vote.' Then I got 52%. They said, 'What the hell happened with the women?' Except this time, see, this is much easier. Because then I was a developer, I was doing great, everything was nice, but I had never done this before. I came in, I said, 'I'm going to rebuild our military. I'm going to cut your taxes. I'm going to cut your regulations. I'm going to get you this, I'm going to get you that. I'm going to take care of our vets.' President Trump: (22:42)I mean, I did things that frankly, I never even talked about like space force. I never talked about space force. The wall is almost built. You know, the wall is up to 392 miles. It's almost built. And Mexico is paying for the wall by the way, you know that. I've been saying it. They hate to hear that, but they're paying. We're putting a charge on where the cars go through and it will more than pay for the wall. But we have now the most secure Southern border that we've ever had. And I want to thank the president of Mexico. They 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border, stopping people from coming into the US illegally. Thank you very much. President Trump: (23:24)No, but we did all these things. So this time in theory, it should be easier. But don't forget, I've gone through years of a fake witch hunt. And now it turned out that they were the guilty party. They were the ones dealing with Russia. They were the guilty people. Think if I didn't have every night on that fake CNN, right over there with the light on. The light just went off. It just went off. Every time I point to them, the light goes off. It's all right, keep it off. Nobody's watching them anyway. President Trump: (23:56)But think if I didn't have every night, Russia, Russia, Russia, hey. And nobody's been tougher on Russia than me. What I've done for NATO. Raised $130 billion a year from other countries that weren't paying their bills. They were delinquent, as we said in the real estate business. They were delinquent. And that goes up to $410 billion. Nobody did that. Obama used to send them pillows maybe from the pillow man on Fox. Did you ever see a man advertised so much? I've never seen it. I've never seen the biggest advertising I think he's the greatest advertising genius, Mike. If I gave him our budget, you wouldn't be able to do anything else but watch Trump ads. The pillow, man. I tell you, I never saw so many ads in my life. Every day, it's a pillow, the pillow. Now he came out with a sheet and I'm going crazy. That's all we need now is a new sheet. But he's on our side too by the way, that guy, he's on our side, Mike. President Trump: (24:57)And now Biden even refuses to answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. You know, elections have consequences. Winning and losing an election, that's big consequences. And we've been winning elections. And they say, 'Well, you know, Trump shouldn't be appointing the new justice because ' well, I'm president. In fact, as you know, a lot of your great justices said, 'No, no they're appointed.' Justice Ginsburg just said recently, not so long ago, 'No, no. He's a president for four years. Not for three years. You appoint ' Now, she was referring to Obama, I think, or Clinton or somebody. But wasn't referring to me, I can promise you that. President Trump: (25:44)Oh, don't worry. Don't worry. It's being filled. You don't have to worry about that. That's much easier than we'll build a wall that goes to that goes for a lot. You know, the wall is one of the biggest projects in the history of this country. You know that right? And we had a party dedicated to the proposition that there will never, ever be a wall. They know was the right thing to do. And I made one big mistake. I should've come instead of saying, 'We will build a wall,' I should have said, 'We will never, ever build a wall.' They would have given me so much money. Made a big mistake. All great congressman over there. Are you guys having a good time, by the way? Huh, Mike? President Trump: (26:22)He said the voters don't deserve to know. And they'll tell you after the election what he's going to do. And you know what I did, I gave you a list. I have 45 people on that list. Every one of them is a star. And I gave you a list. Yeah, sit down, everybody. Just enjoy yourself. What the hell? Look at these people. I didn't even realize you're all standing. I didn't realize you had seats. You're lucky. This is one of the few crowds we provided seats. That's because it's Pennsylvania, I guess. It's pretty good. President Trump: (26:56)If they win, Democrats will pack the Supreme Court with radical left justices who will shred your Second Amendment. You can forget about guns, empower violent mobs, and shield deadly criminals and terrorists. To defend our constitution from this madness, I proudly nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the United States Supreme Court and to the court. She'll be a great justice of the United States Supreme Court. She's done so well. I really found it fascinating today. I don't have too much time, but I tried to watch as much as I could. She was great. President Trump: (27:32)The radical left is hellbent on destroying everything we love and cherish. They're enraged and unhinged. And they are going crazy. Think of it, very many presidents never have anybody to appoint. I will have by the end of the first term, almost 300 federal judges and three Supreme Court justices. Their heads are exploding. I hope they're happy. President Trump: (28:02)They want to cancel you, shame you, and persecute you. That's what they want to do. They want to shame. And this whole cancel culture thing. Now they're after Abraham Lincoln. They don't like Abraham Lincoln. No, he wasn't too good was he? I said this three years ago. Remember when they took down a couple of statues of people you'd never heard of? A Confederate soldier, somebody else, somebody I said, 'Oh, really? Then next will be Robert E. Lee. Then next will be Abraham Lincoln. Then next will be George Washington.' And everybody laughed. They said, 'Oh, the president is so funny.' I said, 'I'm not being funny. These people are sick.' These people, they want to take away your heritage. And by the way, are there any Italians in the room? President Trump: (28:43)Okay, well, we are protecting the legacy of Christopher Columbus. The Italians are tough. I love the Italians. So they were going to rip down the statue of Christopher Columbus in New York. You saw that, right? And all of a sudden, a group of Italian circled around the statue and they were having pretty tough things in their hand, I must say. And it was amazing how those people that wanted to rip it down disappeared very quickly. So the Italians, let me tell you, Christopher Columbus will always be here on my watch, that I can tell you. President Trump: (29:21)I had people the other day that wanted to wish me Happy Columbus Day. They were afraid. I said, 'Why are you ashamed? No, no, say it. Happy Christopher Columbus Day.' This is Christopher Columbus Day. It's Columbus Day.' So Italians say, 'Thank you Mr. President.' I appreciate it. I like you too. I love the Italians. They want to punish the middle-class, expunged every last trace of traditional values, and replace the American dream with the socialist nightmare. And that's what would happen. Just take a look at what's going on in other parts of the world. President Trump: (29:52)Biden's agenda, not that he has one, but you know. He does whatever they tell him to do. He got so lucky. She should have gotten out. She was faithful, she would have gotten out. Bernie would have run. We would have been running against crazy Bernie instead. But I'd rather run against Joe because there's no enthusiasm. There's no energy. One thing with Bernie's people And you know, we got a lot of people last time from Bernie because they loved me on trade, because they know our country has been ripped off on trade like no country has ever been ripped off. And Bernie's people get that. And they like us on trade. President Trump: (30:27)Biden's agenda would be a catastrophe for seniors. For years, Biden tried to cut social security and Medicare. Nobody remembers that. And the press will never bring it up. But he tried to cut your social security. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal health care for the illegal aliens, decimating Medicare and destroying your social security. Biden cares more about illegal aliens than he cares about your senior citizens and it's true. And let me just tell you this. And I say it strongly, and when I first got elected, they always played the social security card. And nothing happened. Your social security now is better than ever. I haven't touched it. While I am president, no one will touch your Medicare or your social security. Under my leadership, we're delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery. If you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, that's what we want. Normal life. We want normal life. We'll fully resume. And next year will be one of the greatest economic years in the history of our country. It's already happening. President Trump: (31:40)How about the stock market? Who has 401ks in the audience? Well, I can tell you one thing, I'm getting all of your votes. I'm getting your votes. Your 401ks is setting records. Think of it, as we're rounding the turn and we are, they go crazy when I say we're rounding the turn on the pandemic. We understand it. Hey, I just had it. Here I am. It's actually me. President Trump: (32:01)And I could've stayed in the basement of the White House or maybe the top floor of the White House. I could have done that, but I'm the president of the United States. I can't do that. I got to get out and I have to meet people and I have to see people. And I know it's risky to do that, but you have to do what you have to do. I'm the president. I can't sit in the basement and say, 'Let's wait this thing out.' I'm not going to do that. And now I'm immune, they tell me I'm immune. I could come down and start kissing everybody. I'll kiss every guy, man and woman, man and woman. Look at that guy, how handsome he is. I'll kiss him. Not with all of enjoyment, but that's okay. President Trump: (32:42)Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate the economy with draconian, unscientific lockdowns, like you're having right now in Pennsylvania with this governor who is killing you. Tom Wolf, Tom Wolf. Come on, Tom. Open up Pennsylvania, Tom. Open it up. You know what's going to happen? November 4th, they'll open it up. You know that? They want to keep the numbers as bad as possible. President Trump: (33:15)Here's the problem. The numbers are going to come out just before the election. So we have November 3rd, the numbers are going to come out. And Pennsylvania is a late voting state. You actually believe in going to a poll because you see all the shenanigans. No, you're a late voting state. And all I can tell you is when I came here and I said this before, but when I came here, I promise you a lot of things. I've done much more than I promised you. You've had the best year you've ever had, and you're going to have a better year next year. You damn well better vote for me, Pennsylvania. You better vote for me. President Trump: (33:53)Sleepy Joe Biden's plan will crush America. And my plan, we're going to crush the virus very quickly. It's happening already. It's happening. Almost 90% less mortality. You know, the mortality rate is at like 85. If you had it seven or eight months ago, it was not as good as if you have it now. And soon it's going to be perfecto. And I said that the drug that they gave me, we're going to be distributing it all over the country to hospitals and everything else, because I'll tell you that sucker works. That's my opinion. What do I know? But to me it works. President Trump: (34:29)And the people that did it. They're phenomenal people. They've had great success with other vaccines and drugs. Just this week, we learned that another member of the Biden family is getting rich off connections to Joe. His son-in-law, just came out, big story, is cashing in on the China virus pandemic, just like Hunter. Where's Hunter? Crashed in on China. What do you think when Hunter walks in and he walks out with a billion and a half dollars to manage for China. I said to a friend of mine, one of the biggest guys on Wall Street, 'Does that ever happened?' He said, 'I'm the biggest guy on Wall Street. That doesn't happen for me.' 10 minutes, he had a billion and a half dollars. Maybe he's not so stupid after all. President Trump: (35:10)To fight the China virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II. And we really should get credit for what we've done, because I'll tell you Mike pats and all of these people, they have worked 24 hours around the clock. Our early and aggressive action saved as many as 2 million lives. Remember when they said, 'No, no, no. You don't want to ban China. Don't ban China.' I did it in January. They were talking a month and a half later, we shouldn't be doing it. He called me xenophobic. President Trump: (35:38)I said, 'Joe, give me a definition of xenophobic, please.' He was unable to do that. We pioneered lifesaving therapies and reduced the fatality rate by 85%. I'm working with the FDA to make the antibody treatments I received. And everybody we're going to have them. They're going to be shipped very soon. We're working on an emergency use authorization, very complicated stuff. And the President Trump: (36:03)Use authorization, very complicated stuff, and the FDA has never responded like they've responded to me. This could have taken years what we've done and we've done it in weeks. I know they came to me on one thing and they said, 'Sir, well that will take approximately two and a half years.' I said, 'No, it's no good.' 'When do you need it, sir?' 'Next week? Tomorrow? How about tomorrow?' No, we're pushing them hard. The FDA has been great. To everyone fighting to recover from the virus, I feel your pain because I felt your pain and we will beat this virus together. Who has had it? Who has had it here? Who's had it? Yeah. A lot of people, a lot of people. Well, you're the people I want to say hello to because you are right now immune. You are right now immune. President Trump: (36:49)Or they say that. You know, they hate to admit it because I had it. So in the old days they said, 'Well, if you have it, you're immune for life,' right? Once I got it, they give you four months. It's anybody else but me, you're immune for life. Through operation warp speed, which is incredible, we'll have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year, 100 million, and the vaccine will end the pandemic once and for all. President Trump: (37:16)And remember this because I have the endorsement of, I think, every major law enforcement and minor law enforcement group in the country. We have a lot of Democrats that left their party and they came over, law enforcement people. I can almost tell you by looking. Look at this group over here. I know the law enforcement people. Nobody's been better. We had all this surplus military equipment. Obama didn't want to give it out because he said it looked too militaristic. I said, 'No, I want to save lives. Okay?' It's defensive equipment. I want to save lives. And we gave out hundreds of millions of It was sitting in warehouses all over the country, military equipment, and we gave it out. But there's nobody like the great men and women of law enforcement. Nobody. President Trump: (38:06)Look at that. Whoa. Whoa. See? They love you. See that? Wow. I didn't expect that. That's pretty good. Audience: (38:16)USA! USA! USA! USA! President Trump: (38:25)That's great. But this election is about law and order. You look at Portland. We keep saying to the governor, 'Look, governor, Oregon.' I said, 'Governor, let us go in. We'll solve the problem in 30 minutes.' They don't want to do that. You know, they're supposed to ask you to come in. We did a great job in Minnesota, Minneapolis, except you know, instead of 10 days, they could have called us like two hours later. But they came in and they lined up and they were not socially distanced. They lined up. You saw that. They came in wearing black uniforms, 250, 000 and most expensive uniforms. I never saw so many computers on a helmet. But they went in and they had their tear gas and they had their pepper spray, which the other side doesn't want us to use anymore. They said, 'No, we don't want to do that.' President Trump: (39:14)These people are a lot of bad people out there. You know, they're anarchists, radical, left anarchists. Okay? So they came in. They came in. You saw it. There was one person. I said, 'Where are the rest?' Then another one. Then another one. Then they started getting off buses, wherever. All of a sudden, you had one line, two line, and they just started moving forward. That was the end of the problem. It ended within 30 minutes. It was over. It was over. And we'll do it wherever they want us. We'd love to go into Portland because those guys are bad news. You saw we sent in the U.S. Marshals, right? Because one man, horrible guy, shot somebody right through the head, shot him in the middle of the street. A guy who wasn't hurting anybody. He killed him. Two days went by. Three days went by. I said, 'Why the hell haven't they arrested him?' And they knew who he was. And we sent in the U.S. Marshals. And in 15 minutes it was all over. That was the end of it. That was the end of it. President Trump: (40:12)Biden Harris and the Democrat party declared war on our police. Okay? And we've proudly received the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association. Wow. The Fraternal Order of Police including those in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Scranton and virtually every single police organization that we know. President Trump: (40:45)And during the debate, I asked sleepy Joe, I said, 'ive me one organization, law enforcement, that's endorsing you.' And he couldn't do it. Then Chris Wallace saved him. Then I said, remember I said, ' Sir, tell me, say the words law and order. Say it, Joe. Say it.' He couldn't do it. He wouldn't do it. He wouldn't do it. Because you know what? Because he'd been run out of his party if he said the words law and order. Then I think at the end, didn't he say like law, and order, and safety, and justice, and you know, all the stuff. No, no. Law and order. Say law and order, Joe. He couldn't do it. President Trump: (41:21)So we're joined tonight by some real warriors, warriors of a different type, political warriors. They're okay too, right? And they're friends of mine. They're great people. Representative John Joyce. John, please. A guy has been around a long time and he fights like hell, G.T. Thompson. G.T., thank you. Great. Be careful with your election. I hear you're only up 40 points, G.T. Another one is only up about 44 points, a really good friend of mine and he's tough as hell, Mike Kelly. I say G.T., Mike, you need any help, I'll come and help you. The say, 'No, sir, we don't really need help. Don't worry about it.' A friend of mine and a great gentleman, and he was the first one that predicted that I was going to win this thing. I'll tell you, former Congressman Lou Barletta. Thank you, Lou. Thank you, Lou. How are we doing, Lou? Are we doing okay? How do we compare to four years ago? Better. Okay, good. He said the right thing. Anyway, yeah, I think a lot better, because we produced. Again, four years ago. I said we're going to do things. Now we've done them all plus additional things, I mean a lot of additional things. I never talked about Space Force. We did Space Force. You know, somebody did Space Force. That's like a major achievement for four years. That's one thing. That's like one thing out of so many other things. So it's one of those things, but I never used to talk about that. President Trump: (42:55)And former chair of the Pennsylvania Republican party, a friend of mine, the guy that knows more about Pennsylvania than any human being on earth, Rob Gleason. Rob, thank you. How are we doing Rob? Good? Okay, good. He said to me another group came down. They didn't want his advice. They came down from Boston and they put events all over the place and he said, 'You're going to the wrong location.' Anyway, they ended up losing big. Right? But with us, we came to Rob. We say, where do you think the best places are? And we hit. And we agreed with you too. But Rob Gleason has been a fantastic friend. Thank you, Rob, very much for being here. I appreciate it. President Trump: (43:33)And with their help and your help, we are delivering for the American people like never before. Nobody's ever done what we've done in three and a half years. No administration's ever done this the first three and a half years. In my first three years in office, family income increased by $6,000 and that doesn't include energy, which I think you could double it up. More than five times the gains in all eight years of the Obama administration. African American income grew nine times more than it did under the last administration. Think of it. African American income grew nine, not two, not three, nine times more, and these are out of the book. These numbers are out of the book. Real well for the bottom. 50% grew nearly twice as fast as it grew for the top. 1% Hispanic family net worth increased by 64% in a short period of time, 64. President Trump: (44:40)We added nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs and we added 15,000 factories, and Obama said 'You'll never produce manufacturing jobs.' Remember? You need a magic wand. Well, we found the magic wand. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty including over 1 million African Americans, and more than 1.5 million Hispanic Americans. And we're doing great with both groups and we love them. We love both groups. Thank you. Those are great numbers. After our tax cuts took effect, wages for the lowest income Americans grew twice as fast as those near the top. Think of that. You never hear that stuff. The big beneficiary were lowest income Americans. My policies have benefited those who need it the most. After the virus came in from China and we had to change. We had to do things. This came out. It was a sudden horrible thing. China should have never, ever let it happen. They should have never let it happen. President Trump: (45:44)We've seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation by far, and we've seen by far the fastest recovery of any nation. In the past five months, we've created a record 11.4 million jobs, that's American jobs. That's the fastest ever recorded. Job growth has been 23 times faster than the first five months. Think of this. For the first five months of the Obama Biden recovery, 23 times. We cut unemployment rate in half. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half the jobs lost to the crisis. We did it in five months. So we're talking about numbers that nobody can even believe. Homebuilder confidence has reached an all time high. We're in a pandemic. Reached an all-time high. Manufacturing optimism has doubled. Consumer confidence, which just came out, has surged nearly 20%, and small business confidence is now higher than any time in the entire decade proceeding my election. Think of that. And we're rounding the turn on our pandemic. President Trump: (47:05)We've spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. He made every bad deal in the book. And by the way, if you look at the H1N1, you know, he calls it the N1H1, right? I said, 'No, no. H. Here's the way you remember it, Joe. H comes before I.' And he goes, 'The N1H1, whatever it's called. What was his name again? Or the Senator? Maybe he was a governor.' Yeah, Romney. Romney. 'Oh, that's right. It was Romney.' It's amazing. You know, amazing. And he gets away with that stuff. You only see it. You only see it on the internet. They never report it. They never report it. They should report it. They're doing this country a great disservice by not reporting it. But Biden supported NAFTA, TPP, and China's entry into the WTO, which is one of the worst things that ever happened to this country. President Trump: (47:59)For half a century, Biden twisted his blade into the heart of the American worker. He should not be asking for your vote. You should be begging for your forgiveness. He did a rotten job. Okay? Did a rotten job. For decades our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we're finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong. Audience: (48:35)USA! USA! USA! USA! President Trump: (48:53)Almost done. Syria, we're gone, except we kept the oil. Does anybody mind that I kept the oil? So we left some troops behind to keep the oil. With Iraq, we're almost out. With Afghanistan, 19 years in Afghanistan, 19 years, and we're really serving as policemen. It's great to be policemen, but they got to have their own policemen. They got to do it themselves. But we're, we're bringing them home. We're down to a very few number of soldiers. President Trump: (49:22)To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the last administration's transpacific partnership disaster. It would have been a disaster. Would have destroyed your automobile industry and others. To defend our steel and aluminum workers, I imposed historic tariffs on dumped goods. Remember when they were dumping steel all over the place? You guys were getting killed. Saving those industries from total destruction. And frankly had the plague not came in from China, but now they're doing well, anyway, had that not come in, you would have had a steel industry that would have been at a level that nobody's ever seen before. But it came in, but you're going to be there anyway in a short period of time, unless some stupid person comes along and raises your taxes by four times what they should be, which is what they want to do. President Trump: (50:07)I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA into law. Everyone said that was going to be impossible to do. And I withdrew from the job killing Paris Climate Accord. So nice of them to tell us that we can't use our energy. That was an accord. You know what that was going to? Destroy our country. That's what that was going to do. If you look at what has happened over the last very short period of time, the progress that this nation has made, you're not even going to believe it and you're going to see it. And you would have seen it had the plague not come in because it was all happening. We were at every single record, but now we're getting close anyway. The jobs are all coming back and the market is almost going to be topping the market from before the plague. And it's pretty amazing. I will tell you. President Trump: (50:54)Biden has vowed to rejoin this horrible agreement, a death sentence for your state's energy industry, The Paris Accord. It's a terrible thing. Unlike Biden, I know my job is to represent Pennsylvania, not Paris. We're representing Pennsylvania, not Paris. Got a lot of nice people. They can represent Paris. President Trump: (51:18)I took the toughest ever action to confront China's rampant theft of American jobs. You know that. We charged them so much. We gave a lot of the money to our farmers, $28 billion to our farmers because our farmers were targeted. Everybody get your money. They did better without even growing anything, to be honest. But we got it from China, $28 billion, and we had a lot left over that went into the treasury of the United States. To defend American workers, earlier today I also signed an order to crack down on Chinese counterfeiters and merchants who sell their fake products all over the United States. They put the name Tiffany, Tiffany. It's got the blue box, everything. Tiffany, Tiffany, Tiffany. Isn't that wonderful? But it wasn't made by Tiffany. President Trump: (52:05)Biden will eliminate my tariffs on China. He's already said he's going to take the tariffs off China. There goes your steel industry. There goes your aluminum industry. That goes everything. Allowing them to plunder without consequence. The one constant in Biden's platform is surrender. He surrenders. He surrenders whether it's a China, whether it's Cuba. How about Cuba? How about the deal they made with Cuba? How bad was that one? I ended it. That's why both China and the far left are desperate for a Biden win because he will surrender our jobs to China. China will own the United States if that sleepy guy gets the position. Okay? And you can forget about Pennsylvania. And you know, don't also forget, your streets will be surrendered to the mob. You know, Republican areas are great. They're doing great. The crime is at record lows, everything else. These are the Democrats, super liberal Democrat areas. President Trump: (53:06)Unlike sleepy Joe Biden, I will never abandon our nation and I will never abandon its values. My goal is not to make friends in the D.C. swamp. My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family. President Trump: (53:25)In 2017, I proudly signed a historic executive order making it official government policy to buy American and hire American. My opponent has put forward a radical plan to eliminate U.S. borders by implementing catch and release programs. And I ended. You know what catch and release is? You catch a murderer, you catch a rapist coming across our border, and you release him. Catch, catch him and release him. And you say, 'I'm sorry. Three years from now, please come back for a court case.' Nobody comes back. Impose- President Trump: (54:03)Please come back for a court case. Nobody comes back. Imposing deadly sanctuary cities and suspending all removals. They don't want any removals. This is what Biden agreed to with crazy Bernie Sanders. When you have people that are in this country illegally, even if they're murderers, if they're rapists, no matter what they are, you can't remove them. We've removed tens of thousands of people including MS-13. President Trump: (54:28)It would mean the total nullification of US borders overwhelming every city and town in America, and especially in a place like Pennsylvania. Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your healthcare is gone, the middle class is gone and your safety is gone. Other than that, you'll be doing very nicely. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we're finishing that wall. It's going to be built very soon. It's going to be finished. We're going to have the greatest celebration. That was a tough one. That was a tough one. Remember they said, 'We don't need a wall.' They wanted drones, drones flying around looking at the people pouring across the border. They wanted drones. They wanted modern technology. You know what I've said often, right? There were two things that will always be around in a thousand years, in 2000 years, all new computers, all new everything. You come up with a new computer. You come up with a new chip. Three days later, it's obsolete. I would not want to be in that business, but there are two things, a wall and a wheel right? A wall and a wheel. In a thousand years, 2000 years, it's going to be here. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in more than 75 years, Space Force. President Trump: (55:54)For our great vets. We pass VA choice and VA accountability. Nobody thought would ever get that done. We killed the leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi, and we took down 100% of the ISIS caliphate. And when I took over, that caliphate was all over the place. It was a mess. We took down the world's number one terrorist and the mass murder of many American troops, many troops, many people all over the world. Qasem Soleimani is dead. Thank you. He's dead. President Trump: (56:37)I withdrew from the last administration's disaster, Iran nuclear deal. One of the worst deals I've ever seen. That's John Kerry, the guy was totally incompetent. That guy didn't know what the hell he was doing. He gave him $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash for nothing. I kept my promise, recognize the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, I've been trying to get that. And instead of endless war, we're forging peace in the Middle East, you see the deals we made? I actually got nominated for a Nobel Peace prize. The press didn't cover it, but that's okay. President Trump: (57:22)The press didn't cover it. I got nominated for three Nobel Peace prizes. I did more in 47 months in Joe Biden did in 47 years and that's true. Now Biden is pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. He's going to ruin your energy. He's going to ruin your state. The Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions because there's no money. Biden's running mates sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance. We have 180 million people with great private plans. They want to keep it that way. They're going to outlaw. They're going to get rid of them. President Trump: (58:15)Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on Jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions by more than 700%. he agreed to this. He said, 'That's okay. Let them come in. I got the ban right? Remember the ban. Remember who's a big deal. I got the ban. I said, 'If it's okay, we have unfriendly countries. If it's all right with you, they're not coming into our country. I got the ban. We won in the Supreme court, five to four. I got the ban.' He wants to give up the ban. He wants to let people pour into our country. 700% increase opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. I don't want to speak too much. Made of wood. This is real wood. I don't want to speak too much, but you haven't seen too many things happening lately have you? He'll ban school choice, charter schools and Pennsylvania opportunity scholarships. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. It's so important. President Trump: (59:15)A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans and in conclusion and I love being back with you in Pennsylvania. So many incredible memories really. So many. What a night that was. Remember that night? Donald Trump has won the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Donald Trump. Remember how late? They just didn't want to call it. They didn't want to call it. I said, 'Call it already.' We were at 98%. We were substantially ahead. If I lost every single vote, we still won. It took him like till two o'clock in morning before they called it. In the meantime, Wisconsin came in and Michigan came in, but they just refused to call Pennsylvania. They just couldn't. Remember them crying and they were all stirred up. President Trump: (01:00:08)Over the next four years. We'll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we'll end our reliance on China once and for all. That's already happening. We'll hire more police, increased penalties for assault on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities that people don't want. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment. We'll strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign ridiculous wars. We will maintain America's unrivaled military mind and we will ensure peace through strength. President Trump: (01:01:03)And by the way, we've rebuilt our military. I told you $2.5 trillion. We have weapons and equipment, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are the envy of Russia. We are the envy of China. We are the envy of everybody. There is no country that has what we have. And I will tell you when I first came here, one of our generals highly overrated said to me, 'Sir, we have no ammunition.' That's where we started. And now we have the greatest weapons anywhere in the world. And just hope to God, we never have to use them. President Trump: (01:01:39)We will then surprise medical building, require price transparency which is already signed January 1, it kicks in, and further reduce the costs of prescription drugs. And I'm talking about 50, 60, 70, 80% because of what I've done with favored nations, getting the lowest price Mike, the whole world. We're going down. We're taking these nations. They pay a fraction of what we pay. I said, 'Nope, whatever they pay, I want to pay.' Why are we paying more than any other nation? We're the highest. We're going down to match the lowest. The drug companies don't love me too much just in case you haven't heard. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security. We'll always protect patients with pre existing conditions. President Trump: (01:02:24)America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and we're very close. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania. It's very important. So get your friends. Most important election we've ever had. Get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote. You got to get out and vote like you'd never voted before. President Trump: (01:03:39)Places that we won like Erie. Places that we won, you got to get out and vote because from Erie to Easton, from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg and from Allentown to right here in Johnstown, we stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence. Think of what you have in Pennsylvania. Who can say that? This is it. What you've done here, what the history of this incredible place, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, think of what you've done. President Trump: (01:04:23)It's where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge and General George Washington Don't worry. His statues are not coming down. Led his man on a daring mission across the Delaware and where our nation was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg. This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mine the coal, work the railroads, and forge the steel, that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And you have seen nothing yet. Wait till you see what we're doing. We are making our country greater than ever before. President Trump: (01:05:12)Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And when you're great Congressman to come to see me, right? It's great. What a group of warriors. I don't know with them. I'm not sure I can handle that group, but when they come in to see me in the Oval Office, they say, 'Mr. President, Pennsylvania is not used to winning this much. We got to slow it down a little bit.' President Trump: (01:05:57)And I'll say, 'Mike, I'm sorry. Mike, you tell the rest of them Mike. We're not going to slow it down at all.' Pennsylvania wants to win more than anybody in this country wants to win. Pennsylvania is going to win. We're never going to stop. We're going to keep on winning. We're going to win so much you're going to love every moment of that era. And you know what? You lost long enough. I can tell you that. Many years where your factories in your plants left because we have stupid leadership. Don't kid yourself. You lost for a long time. And now you're winning and you're winning like never before. Open it up Governor. Open it up. President Trump: (01:06:35)Because we're one movement, one family, one people, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again, and we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much Pennsylvania. Thank you. Get out and vote. Vote, vote, vote."}

THE PRESIDENT: Say it again. Q In the Boeing case. The Boeing case. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, we won a 7.5-billion-dollar case, and that was in , that was a great case to win, as you know. And we'll see what happens. If they strike back, then we'll strike much harder than they'll strike. They don't want to do anything, I can tell you that. But we won , we won a big case , $7.5 billion.

There's never been anything like this, I will say that, with , I'm being very humble. I'll say that, Jeff. Is that okay? But there's never been anything like it. We have tremendous crowds. You saw the lines. They formed two days ago. So we're going to make two stops. And you're going to be with us a little bit, and I know you're going to be with us a little bit. And we have a very exciting election coming up. We're doing very well in North Carolina, very well in Florida, very well pretty much everywhere. We're looking , we're doing very well. And when people find out really what we've done and how good the economy is and how it's coming back, the numbers are fantastic. So we , we seem to be in very good shape. Any questions? Q Stimulus. Can you give us the latest on stimulus talks? On stimulus talks. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, we're having talks today. We're discussing it today, very solidly. We'll see what happens. Q Have you talked with Leader McConnell? THE PRESIDENT: Nancy Pelosi, at this moment, does not want to do anything that's going to affect the election. And I think it will affect the election negatively for her. So we'll see what happens. But there are talks going on as we speak. Q Have you talked with Leader McConnell about this? THE PRESIDENT: I don't want to comment on that. But the Republicans will come along. Q Mr. President, why did you criticize Dr. Fauci? Does it have anything to do with his high standing in public sentiment? THE PRESIDENT: No, I think, really, Dr. Fauci is a very nice man, but we let him do what he wants to do. He gets a lot of television. He loves being on television, and we let him do it. Sometimes he says things that are a little bit off, and they get built up, unfortunately. But he's a nice guy. I like him. But he's called a lot of bad calls. He said don't wear a mask and he said don't ban China. They were bad calls. He admits that. And I don't hold that against him. If I did, I wouldn't have him. I think he's a nice a guy. Q Why don't you fire him? THE PRESIDENT: Huh? Q Why not fire him? THE PRESIDENT: I don't want to. I don't want to hurt him. He's been there for about 350 years. I don't want to hurt him. Q You've been saying that Dr. Fauci said not to wear a mask, but he's been saying to wear a mask for months. THE PRESIDENT: Well, he used to say don't wear a mask. So, you know, you have people on both sides of it. But I'm okay , Q So why are you still quoting that? THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. I'm okay with masks. I like it. I think it's good. A lot of people like it. This gentleman has done an incredible job in Arizona, and he's taken a very tough stand. But he's let his economy grow. And, frankly, if they would've done that in Michigan and various other places, where the governor just shut it down for everybody except for her husband. His attitude , you know, they had a spike, and he let the spike play. And they were careful. And now your state is really in great shape. GOVERNOR DUCEY: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: What a job. So proud of him. Q Your Chief of Staff said today that there will be a lawsuit filed on Section 230 on the tech companies. Is it your , THE PRESIDENT: Who said that? Who said that? Q Mark Meadows said that, as soon as today, there could be a lawsuit filed. THE PRESIDENT: Well, you know , Q Is that from the White House? THE PRESIDENT: , they've given , they've been given great protection. And when they take down people like Charlie Kirk , you know, Charlie Kirk is a terrific person. And I was , I just heard that he was taken down. And how can you take down Charlie Kirk? He's mainstream conservative but solid as a rock. He represents a point of view, and he's putting up something from the New York Post, which is a respected newspaper. I'll tell you what: The biggest winner in this whole thing is a newspaper called the New York Post, the oldest paper in our country. So what they have done is really , I'm very proud of them. Q Are you filing a lawsuit? Or is the campaign filing a lawsuit? THE PRESIDENT: You'll be seeing very soon. Q Mr. President, do you understand that when it comes to the science and a new virus, things change; scientists learn new things and that's why Fauci and some scientists changed their recommendations? THE PRESIDENT: You don't understand. I understand well. You don't understand, and you never have understood. Q Is this election going to be a repeat of 2016, given the polls? THE PRESIDENT: I think so. I think we'll do better than 2016. We're way ahead of where we were in 2016, and I've done things that nobody has ever done. We built the greatest economy in the world, and we're building it rapidly again. If you look at Arizona , you look at the job they've done. And I'm just leaving other states. I mean, every one of these Republican-run states are doing phenomenally. The Democrat-run states are not, but they're not going to affect our numbers very much. I think they're going to open up on November 4th. They'll be opening up on November 4th. And, by the way, the fact that Kristen Welker is, you know, a dyed-in-the-wool radical-left Democrat, or whatever she is , Q It's not true, Mr. President, and you know it. Q That's not true. THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Okay. And then ask , why are you defending her? Q That's not true, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Then ask her: Why did she delete her account? Would you please have her put her account back? Q Mr. President, you've dealt with her, and you know she's a fine journalist. THE PRESIDENT: And you know what? It's not going to affect , I know you want to stick up. It's not going to affect me. I'm going to be there. But, you know, I told you about the last one, and I was right. And I told you about Savannah Guthrie, and I was right. And I'm telling you about Kristen Welker. Kristen Welker should put all of her statements back on. She deleted her entire account. She shouldn't do that. Q What are they going to do with the mics? Are they trying to have , THE PRESIDENT: The what? Q Are they trying to have the moderator be able to turn off the mics? Is that what , THE PRESIDENT: I have no idea. Q Mr. President, what are you doing to prepare for the debate, sir? THE PRESIDENT: I'm doing this. Q (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT: What am I doing to prepare? I'm doing this. I've done , I've done very well in debates. And, you know, you do what you do. You just do what you do. The last debate, I had two on one. I usually have two on one, at least. And I did well in the last debate, and we did well with Savannah Guthrie, based on reports. But all you can do is , look, you know, you go around; we do interviews with you. This is like , I call this \"debate prep.\" This is actually tougher than a debate, if you want to know the truth. Q Will you do the testing before the debate? And will you authorize your , THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q Will you do the testing before the debate? And will you au- , THE PRESIDENT: The testing? Q Yes, the COVID testing. Will you authorize your doctors to tell us when , THE PRESIDENT: Sure. I would have no problem with it. Q , the last negative before you , THE PRESIDENT: I'm , not only am I free , positive, or whatever , what would you call it? I'm totally free. Right? Not only am I free, I'm immune, they say. They say if you've had it, you're immune. Now, the question is, are you immune for four months or for the rest of your life? That's the only thing we don't know. Q Will you authorize your doctors to tell you when you tested negative last, before the last event? THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Is that very important to you? Q Yes, sir, it is. THE PRESIDENT: You seem to be so intent. But if it's so important to you , why is it so important to you? Q Because we want to know how long you may have been , THE PRESIDENT: I know. But why? Why? Q We want to know if you followed the rules from the debate commission. THE PRESIDENT: I know. But why is it so important to you? Q Will you authorize your doctors to release that information? THE PRESIDENT: Look at the dedication. Yeah, my doctors have already given it. You know, my doctors have given more information than has been given on any human being in the history of the world. Q But have not given that detail, Mr. President. Q Mr. President, can you tell us why , what your campaign strategy seems to be to call Biden a \"criminal\"? Why is that? THE PRESIDENT: He is a criminal. He's a criminal. He got caught , Q He was the Vice President of the United States. THE PRESIDENT: Read his laptop. And you know who's a criminal? You're a criminal for not reporting it. You are a criminal for not reporting it. Q I'm asking your strategy. THE PRESIDENT: Let me tell you something: Joe Biden is a criminal, and he's been a criminal for a long time. And you're a criminal, and the media, for not reporting it. Good luck, everybody. Have a good time. Have a good time.

Q Is your fate tied with Senator McSally and her reelection? Or (inaudible) voters , THE PRESIDENT: No, I don't think there's anything to do. I think she's doing fine. It's a separate , I've always viewed that as being highly overrated, and I think we're very separated, but we support each other fully. But I've never been a believer that somebody , that you're tied together. I don't , I don't believe that. I know I'm doing very well. I don't know what her numbers are. I haven't looked. But I hope she does well. She's a very good person. I know my numbers, as you know, are very good in Arizona. Q How are you feeling about the Senate more generally? THE PRESIDENT: It's close , the Senate. The Senate is not , you know, look, as we just discussed with Kelly, I think they're very untied. It's not, you know, a lot of people think,\"Oh, are they tied with Trump?\" Meaning, \"tied together.\" I think that's highly overrated. Highly overrated. But I think we have some really good races that are happening. I'm hearing that John James is doing very well, as an example. I think we have some very good ones. We have some very close ones. And I think I'm doing very well. I'm an individual. I think I'm doing very well, as an individual. And you probably , I probably helped some. I don't think I hurt anybody.

I could do fantastically well in a state, and we could have a sendidate [sic] , Senate candidate that does unbelievably badly. I don't think it has anything to do. It could , it could , it could be something nice, but I don't think it has anything to do, and I was never a big believer in that theory. Q How's your stamina after campaigning for a week? THE PRESIDENT: I think really good. I mean, you people can tell me better than I can. I think really good. I feel great. I don't think anybody can do what I do. You know, when you get up before that many people , you saw that crowd. You were there. When you get up before that many people three or four times a day, there aren't too many people that can do that, and I really have no problem doing it. I'm doing it because it's important to do. I have to do it, and I think it's very important. And I think when I leave a crowd like that , and that's got to be 20,000 people. Did you see them coming in at the , it was incredible. When you leave a crowd like that , and I've had only crowds like that. We've had no small crowd, whether it's in Pennsylvania or anyplace else. Every single place has been like this, and I think there's not a person out of all of those thousands and thousands of people that won't be voting and won't be voting for me. And I think it spreads out to much bigger even than the crowd itself. Q Mr. President, what is the emotion that you are campaigning with? You seem more aggressive. Are you running angry, running scared? How would you describe it? THE PRESIDENT: No, I'm not running scared. I'm running angry because , I think I'm running angry, I'm running happy, and I'm running very content because I've done a great job. And I think that's the reason you have such crowds like this. You could go back into politics 200 years and there's never been a politician that's drawn crowds like this. I don't care who it is, and I don't care who you use and when you talk about it. And when , you know, we're talking about two weeks before, but I would , I would have these crowds six months before, too. It's the same thing. And, you know, you may have a crowd like that for somebody one night before , the night before the election, as you know , where they'll have one crowd like that. But we have them, you know, very early on. No, I think very content. Very content. The reason those people are there is they love the job I've done. In the end, that's what it's got to be about. But there's a certain anger because there's a lot of very unfairness going on here. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician, and you people aren't covering that, and that's not fair. Q Should the FBI be investigating Hunter Biden? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, the FBI should be investigating. I don't know if they are or not, but they should be investigating him. And you'll have to call Wray and ask him. But that is , and why did they have those , and did they have it? Did they have that laptop for a long time and not do anything with it? And that's a question the Washington Times is going to have to look into. But certainly, the FBI should be investigating it because, on its face, he's guilt as can be. There is not even a question about it. On its face, he shouldn't be allowed to run. So we'll see how it goes. Q Mr. President, what are you doing to try win over voters who aren't the folks who are at the rallies, they're not the folks watching Fox News? What are you doing? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I think that we're winning over voters by having such a success. Look, our stock market is almost at the all-time high in our history. And that's with a pandemic. And I know you don't like saying this, but , and I believe we're rounding the turn on the pandemic very substantially and the vaccines will come out. But with all of this, we have the best 401(k)s we've ever had. We've had the best stocks, the best stock market, which is , you know, whether you like stock market or not, it's a leading indicator , the all-time leading indicator. And many people have stocks. But whether they have stocks or 401(k)s, so , you know, I mean, we're doing incredibly well. And we wouldn't be doing that well if I didn't build a foundation, because we got hit with a pandemic; we got hit with the China virus. And if we didn't have the strong foundation, we could never have a stock market , I mean, think of it. We have a stock market that's as high as it was, just about, before we got hit by the pandemic. We have housing numbers that are better. We have enthusiasm numbers, in terms of the country, that are better. And when the Gallup poll comes out last week and says 56 percent of the country are happier now than they were when Obama-Biden had their wonderful administration, I mean, that's a great compliment. So I'm really very happy. I'm very happy with the way it's going. I don't think it's being covered fairly. I don't think you're showing the kind of enthusiasm. I don't think you're showing the crowds and the crowd size. You did, in the Washington Times. I appreciate that. But, for the most part, they're not. But these are the largest crowds ever to meet for rallies, by far. Not even by a little bit. And I don't think people are showing, in terms of the media, the enthusiasm. But the main thing is the people know. One thing I've found out: The public is very smart. They get it. So I'll see you at the next stop, okay? Tucson. Q So just for , if we did not know the answer on November 3rd, would you do other rallies waiting until there was a result? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we'll have to see. I think you'll know. I hope you're going to know the answer on November 3rd. That would be the best thing. Knowing the answer is very important. Thank you. Q (Inaudible) five rallies a day, sir? THE PRESIDENT: I might. The last two or three days, we may go to five. Q Five? THE PRESIDENT: Five.

{"SpeechID":"VSDT2110202061","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-10-21","SpeechTitle":"Executive Order on Creating Schedule F In The Excepted Service","Type":"statement","RawText":"By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301, 3302, and 7511 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. To effectively carry out the broad array of activities assigned to the executive branch under law, the President and his appointees must rely on men and women in the Federal service employed in positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. Faithful execution of the law requires that the President have appropriate management oversight regarding this select cadre of professionals. The Federal Government benefits from career professionals in positions that are not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition but who discharge significant duties and exercise significant discretion in formulating and implementing executive branch policy and programs under the laws of the United States. The heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) and the American people also entrust these career professionals with non\u2011public information that must be kept confidential. With the exception of attorneys in the Federal service who are appointed pursuant to Schedule A of the excepted service and members of the Senior Executive Service, appointments to these positions are generally made through the competitive service. Given the importance of the functions they discharge, employees in such positions must display appropriate temperament, acumen, impartiality, and sound judgment. Due to these requirements, agencies should have a greater degree of appointment flexibility with respect to these employees than is afforded by the existing competitive service process. Further, effective performance management of employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions is of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, the Government's current performance management is inadequate, as recognized by Federal workers themselves. For instance, the 2016 Merit Principles Survey reveals that less than a quarter of Federal employees believe their agency addresses poor performers effectively. Separating employees who cannot or will not meet required performance standards is important, and it is particularly important with regard to employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions. High performance by such employees can meaningfully enhance agency operations, while poor performance can significantly hinder them. Senior agency officials report that poor performance by career employees in policy-relevant positions has resulted in long delays and substandard-quality work for important agency projects, such as drafting and issuing regulations. Pursuant to my authority under section 3302(1) of title 5, United States Code, I find that conditions of good administration make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules and examinations for career positions in the Federal service of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. These conditions include the need to provide agency heads with additional flexibility to assess prospective appointees without the limitations imposed by competitive service selection procedures. Placing these positions in the excepted service will mitigate undue limitations on their selection. This action will also give agencies greater ability and discretion to assess critical qualities in applicants to fill these positions, such as work ethic, judgment, and ability to meet the particular needs of the agency. These are all qualities individuals should have before wielding the authority inherent in their prospective positions, and agencies should be able to assess candidates without proceeding through complicated and elaborate competitive service processes or rating procedures that do not necessarily reflect their particular needs. Conditions of good administration similarly make necessary excepting such positions from the adverse action procedures set forth in chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code. Chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, requires agencies to comply with extensive procedures before taking adverse action against an employee. These requirements can make removing poorly performing employees difficult. Only a quarter of Federal supervisors are confident that they could remove a poor performer. Career employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy\u2011making, and policy-advocating positions wield significant influence over Government operations and effectiveness. Agencies need the flexibility to expeditiously remove poorly performing employees from these positions without facing extensive delays or litigation. Sec. 2. Definition. The phrase \"normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition\" refers to positions whose occupants are, as a matter of practice, expected to resign upon a Presidential transition and includes all positions whose appointment requires the assent of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel. Sec. 3. Excepted Service. Appointments of individuals to positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character that are not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition shall be made under Schedule F of the excepted service, as established by section 4 of this order. Sec. 4. Schedule F of the Excepted Service. (a) Civil Service Rule VI is amended as follows: (i) 5 CFR 6.2 is amended to read:\"OPM shall list positions that it excepts from the competitive service in Schedules A, B, C, D, E, and F, which schedules shall constitute parts of this rule, as follows: Schedule A. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to examine shall be listed in Schedule A. Schedule B. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to hold a competitive examination shall be listed in Schedule B.

TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE,October 21, 2020.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/votesmart.org\/public-statement\/1505909\/executive-order-on-creating-schedule-f-in-the-excepted-service&speechType=6","Summary":"Executive Branch","Source":null,"Location":"Washington, DC","Original source":"https:\/\/trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov\/presidential-actions\/executive-order-creating-schedule-f-excepted-service\/","CleanText":"By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301, 3302, and 7511 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. To effectively carry out the broad array of activities assigned to the executive branch under law, the President and his appointees must rely on men and women in the Federal service employed in positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. Faithful execution of the law requires that the President have appropriate management oversight regarding this select cadre of professionals. The Federal Government benefits from career professionals in positions that are not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition but who discharge significant duties and exercise significant discretion in formulating and implementing executive branch policy and programs under the laws of the United States. The heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) and the American people also entrust these career professionals with non-public information that must be kept confidential. With the exception of attorneys in the Federal service who are appointed pursuant to Schedule A of the excepted service and members of the Senior Executive Service, appointments to these positions are generally made through the competitive service. Given the importance of the functions they discharge, employees in such positions must display appropriate temperament, acumen, impartiality, and sound judgment. Due to these requirements, agencies should have a greater degree of appointment flexibility with respect to these employees than is afforded by the existing competitive service process. Further, effective performance management of employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions is of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, the Government's current performance management is inadequate, as recognized by Federal workers themselves. For instance, the 2016 Merit Principles Survey reveals that less than a quarter of Federal employees believe their agency addresses poor performers effectively. Separating employees who cannot or will not meet required performance standards is important, and it is particularly important with regard to employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions. High performance by such employees can meaningfully enhance agency operations, while poor performance can significantly hinder them. Senior agency officials report that poor performance by career employees in policy-relevant positions has resulted in long delays and substandard-quality work for important agency projects, such as drafting and issuing regulations. Pursuant to my authority under section 3302(1) of title 5, United States Code, I find that conditions of good administration make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules and examinations for career positions in the Federal service of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. These conditions include the need to provide agency heads with additional flexibility to assess prospective appointees without the limitations imposed by competitive service selection procedures. Placing these positions in the excepted service will mitigate undue limitations on their selection. This action will also give agencies greater ability and discretion to assess critical qualities in applicants to fill these positions, such as work ethic, judgment, and ability to meet the particular needs of the agency. These are all qualities individuals should have before wielding the authority inherent in their prospective positions, and agencies should be able to assess candidates without proceeding through complicated and elaborate competitive service processes or rating procedures that do not necessarily reflect their particular needs. Conditions of good administration similarly make necessary excepting such positions from the adverse action procedures set forth in chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code. Chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, requires agencies to comply with extensive procedures before taking adverse action against an employee. These requirements can make removing poorly performing employees difficult. Only a quarter of Federal supervisors are confident that they could remove a poor performer. Career employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, and policy-advocating positions wield significant influence over Government operations and effectiveness. Agencies need the flexibility to expeditiously remove poorly performing employees from these positions without facing extensive delays or litigation. Sec. 2. Definition. The phrase 'normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition' refers to positions whose occupants are, as a matter of practice, expected to resign upon a Presidential transition and includes all positions whose appointment requires the assent of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel. Sec. 3. Excepted Service. Appointments of individuals to positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character that are not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition shall be made under Schedule F of the excepted service, as established by section 4 of this order. Sec. 4. Schedule F of the Excepted Service. (a) Civil Service Rule VI is amended as follows: (i) 5 CFR 6.2 is amended to read:'OPM shall list positions that it excepts from the competitive service in Schedules A, B, C, D, E, and F, which schedules shall constitute parts of this rule, as follows: Schedule A. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to examine shall be listed in Schedule A. Schedule B. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to hold a competitive examination shall be listed in Schedule B. Appointments to these positions shall be subject to such noncompetitive examination as may be prescribed by OPM. Schedule C. Positions of a confidential or policy-determining character normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition shall be listed in Schedule C. Schedule D. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which the competitive service requirements make impracticable the adequate recruitment of sufficient numbers of students attending qualifying educational institutions or individuals who have recently completed qualifying educational programs. These positions, which are temporarily placed in the excepted service to enable more effective recruitment from all segments of society by using means of recruiting and assessing candidates that diverge from the rules generally applicable to the competitive service, shall be listed in Schedule D. Schedule E. Position of administrative law judge appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105. Conditions of good administration warrant that the position of administrative law judge be placed in the excepted service and that appointment to this position not be subject to the requirements of 5 CFR, part 302, including examination and rating requirements, though each agency shall follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, if you look at the vote, the early vote, it's not nearly what they thought it would be. It's just not what they thought. We're going to have a great red wave. It's going to be a red wave like you've never seen before, because people are tired of looking at the anarchists and all of the things taking place in Portland, Chicago, New York, with crime. They're tired of it. But you're going to have a red wave the likes of which you haven't seen. And everybody knows it. And they , you know, I don't think they're doing very well. They have no enthusiasm. Look, Obama shows up for a speech, and nobody shows. What did he have yesterday? Thirty-two people showed up? We've got 35-, 40,000 people half the time.

Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, this is a momentous day for America, for the United States Constitution, and for the fair and impartial rule of law. The Constitution is the ultimate defense of American liberty. The faithful application of the law is the cornerstone of our Republic. That is why, as President, I have no more solemn obligation and no greater honor than to appoint Supreme Court justices. On this October evening , and it is so beautiful , the First Lady and I welcome you to the White House to bear witness to history. In a few moments, we will proudly swear in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court: Justice Amy Coney Barrett. (Applause.) She is one of our nation's most brilliant legal scholars, and she will make an outstanding justice on the highest court in our land. Justice Barrett's oath will be administered by the Court's longest-serving member currently on the bench , a man whose allegiance to the law has earned him the respect and gratitude of all Americans: Justice Clarence Thomas. (Applause.) Our country owes a debt of thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. We appreciate it very much, Mitch. Thank you. (Applause.) And we are grateful as well to the Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham. Thank you, Lindsey. (Applause.) Also with us, Senators Marsha Blackburn, Mike Braun, Bill Cassidy, Kevin Cramer, Ted Cruz, Steve Daines, Ron Johnson, James Lankford, Mike Lee, and Martha McSally. And I hope I didn't leave anybody out. (Applause.) And a very special thanks to our great Vice President, Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike. (Applause.) Also, I want to thank White House Counsel Pat Cipollone. Thank you, Pat. (Applause.) And very importantly, I want to welcome Justice Barrett's husband, Jesse. Thank you, Jesse. Thank you. (Applause.) Let me also recognize your seven children , your great, beautiful children , who have become, really, just very, very popular in this nation. People have been watching them and loving them, and they're watching right now back home in Indiana. Thank you very much. (Applause.) And I speak to everyone when I say that the Barrett family has captured America's heart. It is highly fitting that Justice Barrett fills the seat of a true pioneer for women: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Tonight, Justice Barrett becomes not only the fifth woman to serve on our nation's highest court, but the very first mother of school-aged children to become a Supreme Court justice. Very important. (Applause.) Over the past few weeks, the entire world has seen Justice Barrett's deep knowledge, tremendous poise, and towering intellect. She answered questions for hours on end. Throughout her entire confirmation, her impeccable credentials were unquestioned, unchallenged, and obvious to all. Justice Barrett earned a full academic scholarship to Notre Dame Law School, graduated first in her class, and served as a clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia. She was a beloved professor at Notre Dame Law School for 15 years before I very proudly appointed her to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in 2017. The American people have been profoundly impressed to learn of her achievements, her compassion, her generosity, her faith, and her sterling character. Justice Barrett has made clear she will issue rulings based solely upon a faithful reading of the law and the Constitution as written, not legislate from the bench. The equal, impartial, and constitutional rule of law that we enjoy every day in America is one of the crowning achievements in the history of human civilization. It is the triumph of reason, experience, and the values which are eternal and everlasting. Our devotion to this inheritance is what has made America the most just, exceptional, and glorious nation ever to exist. I want every American child watching to understand that this is a very special and important ceremony. We are fulfilling the duty that passes to each new generation to sustain the national traditions and virtues that make possible everything we have achieved before that we will do tomorrow. Because of our Constitution and our culture of freedom, you live in a land where anything is possible and where any dream can come true. No matter who you are, no matter your background, in America, everyone is entitled to equal protection under our laws, and your sacred rights can never, ever be taken away. The march of liberty that began with the American Revolution continues onward this evening. Tonight at the White House, we carry forward the cause of freedom, equality, and justice for which so many generations of Americans have given so much. We honor the cause for which men died to win the Civil War, and for which they jumped out of airplanes and shed their blood on distant battlefields. We honor the immortal principles that inspired millions in the struggle for Civil Rights, and we take special pride in the nation that inspires billions of people all over the world. We must never take this radiant inheritance for granted. We must never lose confidence in our history, our heritage, or in our heroes. To reach for the stars, we must stand upon the strong and sturdy foundation built by those incredible Americans who came before. Justice Barrett, as you take your oath tonight, the legacy of our ancestors falls to you. The American people put their trust in you and their faith in you as you take up the task of defending our laws, our Constitution, and this country that we all love. We ask God to give you wisdom and courage. I know you will make us all very, very proud. As long as we are loyal to our founding and to our fellow citizens, America's future will be bright, America's destiny will be great, and America's people will forever and always be free. I now ask Justice Thomas to administer the Oath. Thank you very much. (The Judicial Oath is administered.) (Applause.) JUSTICE BARRETT: Thank you. Thank you so very much. Thank you all for being here tonight. And thank you, President Trump, for selecting me to serve as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. It's a privilege to be asked to serve my country in this office, and I stand here tonight truly honored and humbled. Thanks also to the Senate for giving its consent to my appointment. I am grateful for the confidence you have expressed in me, and I pledge to you and to the American people that I will discharge my duties to the very best of my ability. This was a rigorous confirmation process, and I thank all of you, especially Leader McConnell and Chairman Graham for helping me to navigate it. My heartfelt thanks go to the members of the White House staff and Department of Justice who worked tirelessly to support me through this process. Your stamina is remarkable, and I have been the beneficiary of it. Jesse and I are also so grateful to the many people have supported , who have supported our family over these last several weeks. Through ways both tangible and intangible, you have made this day possible. Jesse and I have been truly awestruck by your generosity. I have spent a good amount of time over the last month at the Senate, both in meetings with individual senators and in days of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The confirmation process has made ever clearer to me one of the fundamental differences between the federal judiciary and the United States Senate, and perhaps the most acute is the role of policy preferences. It is the job of a senator to pursue her policy preferences. In fact, it would be a dereliction of duty for her to put policy goals aside. By contrast, it is the job of a judge to resist her policy preferences. It would be a dereliction of duty for her to give in to them. Federal judges don't stand for election.

Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, this is a momentous day for America, for the United States Constitution, and for the fair and impartial rule of law. The Constitution is the ultimate defense of American liberty. The faithful application of the law is the cornerstone of our Republic. That is why, as President, I have no more solemn obligation and no greater honor than to appoint Supreme Court justices. On this October evening , and it is so beautiful , the First Lady and I welcome you to the White House to bear witness to history. In a few moments, we will proudly swear in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court: Justice Amy Coney Barrett. (Applause.) She is one of our nation's most brilliant legal scholars, and she will make an outstanding justice on the highest court in our land. Justice Barrett's oath will be administered by the Court's longest-serving member currently on the bench , a man whose allegiance to the law has earned him the respect and gratitude of all Americans: Justice Clarence Thomas. (Applause.) Our country owes a debt of thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. We appreciate it very much, Mitch. Thank you. (Applause.) And we are grateful as well to the Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham. Thank you, Lindsey. (Applause.) Also with us, Senators Marsha Blackburn, Mike Braun, Bill Cassidy, Kevin Cramer, Ted Cruz, Steve Daines, Ron Johnson, James Lankford, Mike Lee, and Martha McSally. And I hope I didn't leave anybody out. (Applause.) And a very special thanks to our great Vice President, Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike. (Applause.) Also, I want to thank White House Counsel Pat Cipollone. Thank you, Pat. (Applause.) And very importantly, I want to welcome Justice Barrett's husband, Jesse. Thank you, Jesse. Thank you. (Applause.) Let me also recognize your seven children , your great, beautiful children , who have become, really, just very, very popular in this nation. People have been watching them and loving them, and they're watching right now back home in Indiana. Thank you very much. (Applause.) And I speak to everyone when I say that the Barrett family has captured America's heart. It is highly fitting that Justice Barrett fills the seat of a true pioneer for women: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Tonight, Justice Barrett becomes not only the fifth woman to serve on our nation's highest court, but the very first mother of school-aged children to become a Supreme Court justice. Very important. (Applause.) Over the past few weeks, the entire world has seen Justice Barrett's deep knowledge, tremendous poise, and towering intellect. She answered questions for hours on end. Throughout her entire confirmation, her impeccable credentials were unquestioned, unchallenged, and obvious to all. Justice Barrett earned a full academic scholarship to Notre Dame Law School, graduated first in her class, and served as a clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia. She was a beloved professor at Notre Dame Law School for 15 years before I very proudly appointed her to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in 2017. The American people have been profoundly impressed to learn of her achievements, her compassion, her generosity, her faith, and her sterling character. Justice Barrett has made clear she will issue rulings based solely upon a faithful reading of the law and the Constitution as written, not legislate from the bench. The equal, impartial, and constitutional rule of law that we enjoy every day in America is one of the crowning achievements in the history of human civilization. It is the triumph of reason, experience, and the values which are eternal and everlasting. Our devotion to this inheritance is what has made America the most just, exceptional, and glorious nation ever to exist. I want every American child watching to understand that this is a very special and important ceremony. We are fulfilling the duty that passes to each new generation to sustain the national traditions and virtues that make possible everything we have achieved before that we will do tomorrow. Because of our Constitution and our culture of freedom, you live in a land where anything is possible and where any dream can come true. No matter who you are, no matter your background, in America, everyone is entitled to equal protection under our laws, and your sacred rights can never, ever be taken away. The march of liberty that began with the American Revolution continues onward this evening. Tonight at the White House, we carry forward the cause of freedom, equality, and justice for which so many generations of Americans have given so much. We honor the cause for which men died to win the Civil War, and for which they jumped out of airplanes and shed their blood on distant battlefields. We honor the immortal principles that inspired millions in the struggle for Civil Rights, and we take special pride in the nation that inspires billions of people all over the world. We must never take this radiant inheritance for granted. We must never lose confidence in our history, our heritage, or in our heroes. To reach for the stars, we must stand upon the strong and sturdy foundation built by those incredible Americans who came before. Justice Barrett, as you take your oath tonight, the legacy of our ancestors falls to you. The American people put their trust in you and their faith in you as you take up the task of defending our laws, our Constitution, and this country that we all love. We ask God to give you wisdom and courage. I know you will make us all very, very proud. As long as we are loyal to our founding and to our fellow citizens, America's future will be bright, America's destiny will be great, and America's people will forever and always be free. I now ask Justice Thomas to administer the Oath. Thank you very much. (The Judicial Oath is administered.) (Applause.) JUSTICE BARRETT: Thank you. Thank you so very much. Thank you all for being here tonight. And thank you, President Trump, for selecting me to serve as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. It's a privilege to be asked to serve my country in this office, and I stand here tonight truly honored and humbled. Thanks also to the Senate for giving its consent to my appointment. I am grateful for the confidence you have expressed in me, and I pledge to you and to the American people that I will discharge my duties to the very best of my ability. This was a rigorous confirmation process, and I thank all of you, especially Leader McConnell and Chairman Graham for helping me to navigate it. My heartfelt thanks go to the members of the White House staff and Department of Justice who worked tirelessly to support me through this process. Your stamina is remarkable, and I have been the beneficiary of it. Jesse and I are also so grateful to the many people have supported , who have supported our family over these last several weeks. Through ways both tangible and intangible, you have made this day possible. Jesse and I have been truly awestruck by your generosity. I have spent a good amount of time over the last month at the Senate, both in meetings with individual senators and in days of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The confirmation process has made ever clearer to me one of the fundamental differences between the federal judiciary and the United States Senate, and perhaps the most acute is the role of policy preferences. It is the job of a senator to pursue her policy preferences. In fact, it would be a dereliction of duty for her to put policy goals aside. By contrast, it is the job of a judge to resist her policy preferences. It would be a dereliction of duty for her to give in to them. Federal judges don't stand for election. Thus, they have no basis for claiming that their preferences reflect those of the people. This separation of duty from political preference is what makes the judiciary distinct among the three branches of government. A judge declares independence not only from Congress and the President, but also from the private beliefs that might otherwise move her. The Judicial Oath captures the essence of the judicial duty the rule of law must always control. My fellow Americans, even though we judges don't face elections, we still work for you. It is your Constitution that establishes the rule of law and the judicial independence that is so central to it. The oath that I have solemnly taken tonight means, at its core, that I will do my job without any fear or favor, and that I will do so independently of both the political branches and of my own preferences. I love the Constitution and the Democratic Republic that it establishes, and I will devote myself to preserving it. Thank you. (Applause.)"}

What's happening to Europe is , nobody has seen anything like it. And you used to tell me all about Europe. No, we're doing a great job. We are absolutely rounding the corner. Other than the fake news wants to scare everybody, we are absolutely rounding the corner. Go ahead. Q Are you planning an event for Amy Coney Barrett this evening? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. We're going to see probably at the White House later on this evening, see how it all works out. The vote is taking place, and we'll see how that works out. Q Will it be a large event? And are you concerned about , THE PRESIDENT: No, not a large event. Just a very nice event. Q Is a ceasefire holding between Armenia and Azerbaijan? THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q The ceasefire between Azerbaijan and Armenia, is that holding or what's that holding? THE PRESIDENT: It's holding. The ceasefire is holding. Okay? We'll see you over at the event.

We'll be making three big stops , three rally stops. I understand that they've been camped out for a couple of days already, and we have a lot of people , thousands and thousands. I want to just tell you how happy everybody is, including me, with Justice Barrett. She is going to be a great justice for many, many years. And I'm very proud of the way she , she went through that process. That was an incredible process. It was a tough process, but she got through it very easily, and we're very proud of the fact that she is now a justice of the Supreme Court. Q Do you want to react to what President Obama said in his speech? THE PRESIDENT: I only saw he was on Fox. And Fox puts him on all the time, and they put Sleepy Joe on all the time. And what they should do is they should show the picture of Sleepy Joe yesterday, when he rushed to Pennsylvania because he saw that I had 25,000 people at each event. When he rushed to Pennsylvania and he did a statement and he got lost in a fog, they should show that. Okay? Or they should show the picture where he called me \"George.\" He thought I was George. I guess, he's talking about George Bush. But he thought I was George, and they should show that. No, Fox , Fox is very disappointing. That Fox puts on this , this would not have happened with Roger Ailes, I can tell you that. Go ahead. Q (Inaudible) are you willing to still talk about stimulus (inaudible)? THE PRESIDENT: I'll always talk about it because our people should get it. Q After the election, though? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Our people should get it , the stimulus. But Nancy Pelosi is only interested in bailing out badly run, crime-ridden Democrat cities and states. That's all she's interested in. She's not interested in helping the people. We'll , after the election, we'll get the best stimulus package you've ever seen, because I think we're going to take back the House because of her. I think you have a lot of congressmen and women , Republican , that are going to get elected. We'll take back the House. We'll hold the Senate. We'll hold the White House. If you look at the polls that came out today and yesterday , and I guess a lot had to do with the debate or a lot had to do with the rallies. I don't know. But you take a look at the polls. Look at how we're doing in Wisconsin. Look how we're doing in Iowa. Look how we're doing in Ohio. Look how we're doing in Florida. Look how we're doing everywhere, practically. So I think we're doing very well. We're going to have an exciting night. It would be very, very proper and very nice if a winner were declared on November 3rd, instead of counting ballots for two weeks, which is totally inappropriate, and I don't believe that that's by our laws. I don't believe that. So we'll see what happens. Q Mr. President, shouldn't the voters judge you on COVID? And did you blow it? THE PRESIDENT: Voters are judging me on a lot of things, and one of the things we've done a really good job on is COVID. We would have millions of people , millions, right now , we would have millions of people , Q That's if you did nothing. THE PRESIDENT: , dead. Two million people. They were projecting 2.2 [million] if we didn't do what we did. We did the ventilators and now we're doing all of the equipment. But now we're doing vaccines, we're doing , Q But isn't that if you did nothing? THE PRESIDENT: , therapeutics, and we've done a great job. And people are starting to see. Now Biden had the swine flu. He did the worst job that anybody has ever seen. Had no idea what he was doing. And his Chief of Staff said he had no idea what he was doing. I'll see you in Michigan.

Would you like to see Goggle split up? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think what is going on with all of those companies , I think they've hurt themselves very badly because they've been so restrictive. And, you know, when they don't want to show corruption, like you have with Biden , that's totally corruption and everybody knows it , and they're trying to protect, because he can make them wealthier, whereas they understand me.

And Sudan , that was a great , that was a great get, because, as you know, there's been tremendous hostility with Israel. So, yeah, we're very excited about it, and we did it a much different way than they've been working over the last 30 years. But we're very excited. Q Are you disappointed by Armenia and Azerbaijan? Armenia and Azerbaijan. The ceasefire has collapsed. THE PRESIDENT: Well, they've been at it for years. They don't get together. But they've been at that for many, many years. Yeah, it's disappointing to see that, but that's what happens when you have countries , countries that have been going at it for a long time. It'll get back together.

They're all out to it. Anything else? Q If you could speak to the governor of Minnesota right now, what would you say? THE PRESIDENT: I can probably speak to him. I can probably call him. I haven't. But I think the people of Minnesota are very angry about it, from what I understand. Number one, they went through riots. And then we saved them , with the riots. But they should've , we should've been called a long time before. And they've gone through a lot, the people of Minnesota. Minneapolis has been a disaster.

We're going to Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. It'll be a big day. I think we had one of our biggest days ever. It wasn't reported like it should have been, but we had GDP up 31 , 33.1 percent. That was the biggest increase in the history of our country. And I think we're going to have some other good quarters, very good quarters. And I think next year, if you don't raise taxes like Biden wants to do , he wants to quadruple your taxes and destroy it , but if you don't do that, we are going to have the best deal we've ever had economically, next year. We're superseding all other countries. Our gain is bigger than any other country. Our percentage gain is bigger. And we went down less than any other country economically. So it's incredible. And we're doing very well with respect to making the turn on the pandemic. We're working very hard on that. Great therapeutics. You saw various articles today , I guess, even the fake New York Times , you saw an article where people that are seriously ill are getting better. It's the first time I've ever heard them say that. We have great medicines; I would call them cures, but other people call them therapeutics. But we have some great things coming out, and we have some great things already out. And some are already in use , as you know, fully approved by the FDA. And I think that's what's happening, where people are getting better, and they're getting better much faster. So that's great. The economy is going to be, very shortly, at a level which I don't think it ever was. Last year was the best year we've ever had. And I really believe that next year, starting really now , I mean, you could start now, but next year will be the best year, economically, we've ever had. And I can't stress more strongly: an increase of 33.1. You have to go back to 1952; you have to go back to 1961 , many, many years , to find anything. And even then, it's less than half of the number that we're talking about. So it's been a , it was a great day and a great day yesterday. And now today we're really celebrating it because nobody thought it was possible. Nobody thought we could ever have that kind of an economic gain. Nobody. Nobody was predicting it. So we're very happy about that. It really shows that our policies work. If you had a President with different ideas, instead of having a 33.1 gain, you'd have a disaster on your hands. But we're set for the best year we've ever had. Q What are you going to be doing on Election Night? Are you going to be here or at your hotel? THE PRESIDENT: We haven't made a determination. We have certain rules and regulations. You know, Washington, D.C. is shut down. The mayor has shut it down. So we have a hotel; I don't know if it's shut , if you're allowed to use it or not, but I know the mayor has shut down Washington, D.C. And if that's the case, we'll probably stay here or pick another location. I think it's crazy Washington, D.C. is shut down. Can you imagine? Q Are you worried about Texas? It looks pretty close there. THE PRESIDENT: No, Texas, we're doing very well. It's going to be the same thing as last year. In fact, I think , last term. I think you asked the question last time too. Texas is looking very close, and I won it by many, many points. Texas is looking very strong. I will tell you that, if you look around, Florida is looking great. Florida is looking really great. Ohio is looking great. North Carolina is fantastic, actually. We think Pennsylvania is looking fantastic, but that's a late vote, and we think those people , the Pennsylvania , what I've done for Pennsylvania. And you have to remember: He wants no fracking. Whether you say it or not, he wants no fracking, and he showed that in the debate. And if Pennsylvania didn't frack, you wouldn't have Pennsylvania. Believe me, it would destroy Pennsylvania. It's a million jobs. It's a tremendous amount of money. And they're really one of our big producers, so they have to frack. He is not going to let them frack. His party will not let them frack , which is more important. Q What about your meeting with Lil Wayne? Why did you meet with him? What did he say to you? THE PRESIDENT: Well, he wanted a meeting. He's a really nice guy. He's really an activist, in a very positive way. And he asked for a meeting, and we had the meeting. And as you saw, the meeting went very well. Lil Wayne. Go ahead. Q Mr. President, on Election Day, what states are you going to travel to? THE PRESIDENT: I don't know. But I may be traveling on Election Day. I may be doing , that's a very good question. I'll give you that answer in the next couple of days. We're doing a lot of traveling. We'll be doing a lot of rallies. We have some big ones. We're having a problem with some people in Minnesota where they have a cap because Biden goes there and he can't draw flies; he can't draw anybody. Gets a few cars, I guess, and they honk their horn. We've got the biggest crowds in the history of politics, and I think you will all be witness to that because there's never been anybody that has ever had bigger crowds or more enthusiasm than we have. So we have 25,000 people in Minnesota, which is our last stop today. Twenty-five thousand people want to be there. And they say you can only have 250 people. So they'd thought I'd cancel, but I'm not cancelling. And we'll find out what happens. But we have 25,000 people in Minnesota. And they're there because they're angry at the riots and they know that I stopped them, but I stopped them after it was requested and very late. They should have requested it two weeks earlier. But they're angry at Omar. They're angry at all of this stuff that's going on in Minnesota. And I think it's going to flip for the first time since 1972. Okay? Anybody else? Q Stimulus. Are you , what about , what's happening there? THE PRESIDENT: We're going to have a tremendous , we will have , do you want me to answer that one, Steve? Yes? We will have a tremendous stimulus package immediately after the election. And I think we're going to take back the House. I think we're going to do very well in the Senate. A little bit more complex, frankly. And I think we're going to have a fantastic presidential election because nobody has done more than this administration in the first three and a half years. There's never been a President or an administration that's done more than we have , for our farmers, for our manufacturers, for everybody, in terms of tax cuts; for our military , what we've done with the military, in terms of budget: $2.5 trillion. We'll be completing the wall very shortly. We're up 400 miles. Nobody has done what we've done , even close. So I think we're going to have a great election. People are going to realize that. That's why you have the big turnout. That's why you have the big crowds. So we'll see you there, okay?

Q Are you going to declare a victory on Tuesday , are you going to declare a victory on Tuesday night whether all the results are in? THE PRESIDENT: No, no, that was a false report. We'll look at what happened. I think it's a terrible thing when ballots can be collected after an election. I think it's a terrible thing when people or states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over because it can only lead to one thing, and that's very bad. You know what that thing is. I think it's a very dangerous, terrible thing. And I think it's terrible when we can't know the results of an election the night of the election in a modern-day age of computers. I think it's a terrible thing. And I happen to think it was a terrible decision for our country made by the Supreme Court. I think it was a terrible decision for our country. And I think it's a very dangerous decision because you're going to have one or two or three states, depending on how it ends up, where they're tabulating ballots, and the rest of the world is waiting to find out. And I think there's great danger to it, and I think a lot of fraud and misuse could take place. I think it's a terrible decision by the Supreme Court , a terrible decision.

But we don't want to have Pennsylvania, where you have a political governor , a very partisan guy , and we don't want to have other states , like Nevada, where you have the head of the Democratic clubhouse as your governor. We don't want to be in a position where he's allowed to, every day, watch ballots come in. \"Gee, if we could only find 10,000 more ballots.\" Because we're doing great in Nevada. We're doing great in Arizona. We're doing great all over. But if you take Nevada or Pennsylvania , and everyone knows what happens in Philadelphia. You don't have to say it. But I've read about it for years. And I don't think it's fair that we have to wait a long period of time after the election.

Facing the threat of diabetes head on, particularly in our aging population, is a top priority of my Administration. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 1 in 10 Americans have diabetes, and approximately a third are prediabetic, meaning they are at a high risk of developing it. Through innovative policies, we are confronting the public health challenge of diabetes head on. The United States has increased efforts to reduce the prevalence of diabetes, namely through increased physical activity and changes to our diets. For those living with diabetes during the pandemic, the increased risk of experiencing poor clinical outcomes if diagnosed with COVID-19 is an extra burden, particularly for the elderly and those with other chronic conditions. That is why my Administration has taken action to provide many seniors in Medicare Part D plans with access to a broad set of insulins at a maximum $35 copay for a month's supply and started covering newer insulin delivery devices. We have also made great strides to make prescription drugs, including anti-diabetic drugs, more affordable and accessible. Since I took office, we have approved the largest number of generic drugs in history, and prescription drug prices declined for the first time in nearly 50 years.

Facing the threat of diabetes head on, particularly in our aging population, is a top priority of my Administration. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 1 in 10 Americans have diabetes, and approximately a third are prediabetic, meaning they are at a high risk of developing it. Through innovative policies, we are confronting the public health challenge of diabetes head on. The United States has increased efforts to reduce the prevalence of diabetes, namely through increased physical activity and changes to our diets. For those living with diabetes during the pandemic, the increased risk of experiencing poor clinical outcomes if diagnosed with COVID-19 is an extra burden, particularly for the elderly and those with other chronic conditions. That is why my Administration has taken action to provide many seniors in Medicare Part D plans with access to a broad set of insulins at a maximum $35 copay for a month's supply and started covering newer insulin delivery devices. We have also made great strides to make prescription drugs, including anti-diabetic drugs, more affordable and accessible. Since I took office, we have approved the largest number of generic drugs in history, and prescription drug prices declined for the first time in nearly 50 years. Improving the price and accessibility of medications to manage diabetes enhances quality of life and provides security for patients and their loved ones. As we collectively observe National Diabetes Month, the First Lady and I pray for the millions of Americans who are living with this condition. Together, we will continue working towards innovative and affordable cures and therapies to secure a healthier future for all."}

We've had a very big day. We have two more stops: this one and then Michigan. Grand Rapids, that's where we ended the last campaign. Tomorrow morning, we're going to go, probably, over to one of our offices. But for the most part, I think we'll be , and you'll be coming with us, I imagine , but we'll be going over to one of the offices perhaps in Virginia. It's been an amazing day. It's been an amazing two days. I don't think anybody has ever seen crowds like this. We're getting very good results from early voting and from ballots. And we'll have to see how it all works out. We won't know for a little while. I think the Pennsylvania decision by the Supreme Court is a very dangerous decision. I think it's a decision that allows tremendous cheating to go on after the fact but before the votes are tabulated. I think it's a very, very dangerous decision for our country, and I hope it's going to be readjusted. We'll be asking for that. But it is a , it is a horrendous decision for our country. It's a mistake. It allows cheating. It allows cheating at a very high level, and very easy cheating, too. They have much commentary about it on television. I noticed on the way over, they have a lot of commentary about it, how it totally opens up Pennsylvania for cheating. And we can't let that happen to the people of Pennsylvania or to the people of our country. So let's , we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens. But we cannot let that , and I'm saying this before the fact, not after the fact , we can't let that happen to the people of our country. So thank you very much. I hope you enjoy the speech. Yes? Q Here you are, a few hours from voting day. Are you nervous about anything? THE PRESIDENT: Say it? Q Here you are, just a few hours before voting day. Are you nervous about anything? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I've been here before. I think we're in a much stronger position than we were four years ago. The campaign , I mean, you're a witness to it. The campaign has even more energy. The crowds are much bigger. Much bigger. And we had the biggest crowds ever, and these crowds are much bigger. Nobody has ever seen this. This has never happened before. And there's a , there's a tremendous spirit. Even the organic, the , you know, where they have 100 miles of cars, where they have thousands of tractors, where they have 6,000 votes in a lake or in the ocean or in a canal. Nobody has ever seen this before. And, you know, I'm honored to be a part of it. I'm just a part of it. I'm representative of it, but I'm really just a part of it, and I'm really honored by it. And I think you're going to see all of those people voting, and it's going to be a wave. And it's my opinion, but I've never seen anything like it either. You go to Kenosha, you go to Grand Rapids , Grand Rapids, they say it's , it's like an unlimited number of people. Kenosha, they say they've never seen anything like it. We're going to be there in half an hour, so you'll see. Q Are you expecting a long night tomorrow night? Do you think it's going to be a long, late night? THE PRESIDENT: I'm very concerned about Pennsylvania. Philadelphia is known for bad things happening with voting. You know that. And it's been known for it for a long time. And I'm very concerned when the Court allows you to go outside of the November 3rd date and they allow you to do all sorts of things for an extended period of time. Bad things will happen, and bad things lead to other type things. It's a very dangerous thing for our country. And I hope the Supreme Court has the wisdom to change it, because they can't let it stand. All they have to do is look at the commentators on television that are experts at this, and they will say, \"It will allow cheating.\" It's almost like putting officials that are political hacks, in many cases, and not the most honorable people , it's like putting them on the honor system. And we can't let this happen. We can't let it happen. This is going to be a great election. I think you're going to have a result that I think is going to be a very positive result for the people. Look, I watched Joe Biden go out; there's nobody shows up to see him. He's got the circles. He can't fill up the circles. And then we have forty and fifty thousand people. You saw Miami last night. Nobody has ever seen anything like that. So I don't , you know, I don't , I can't imagine, because this is really the will of the people. They like what we're doing. They like what we're doing, more than they've ever liked anything in a long time. So we can't let this happen in Pennsylvania. So I'll see you over in Kenosha. I'll see you at Grand Rapids. And maybe we'll get to talk again. Okay? Thank you all very much. Thank you.

Purpose. The American founding envisioned a political order in harmony with the design of \"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God,\" seeing the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as embodied in and sanctioned by natural law and its traditions. The formation of a republic around these principles marked a clear departure from previous forms of government, securing rights through a form of government that derives its legitimate power from the consent of the governed. Throughout its national life, our Republic's exploration of the full meaning of these principles has led it through the ratification of a Constitution, civil war, the abolition of slavery, Reconstruction, and a series of domestic crises and world conflicts. Those events establish a clear historical record of an exceptional Nation dedicated to the ideas and ideals of its founding. Against this history, in recent years, a series of polemics grounded in poor scholarship has vilified our Founders and our founding. Despite the virtues and accomplishments of this Nation, many students are now taught in school to hate their own country, and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes, but rather villains. This radicalized view of American history lacks perspective, obscures virtues, twists motives, ignores or distorts facts, and magnifies flaws, resulting in the truth being concealed and history disfigured. Failing to identify, challenge, and correct this distorted perspective could fray and ultimately erase the bonds that knit our country and culture together. The recent attacks on our founding have highlighted America's history related to race. These one-sided and divisive accounts too often ignore or fail to properly honor and recollect the great legacy of the American national experience \u2011- our country's valiant and successful effort to shake off the curse of slavery and to use the lessons of that struggle to guide our work toward equal rights for all citizens in the present. Viewing America as an irredeemably and systemically racist country cannot account for the extraordinary role of the great heroes of the American movement against slavery and for civil rights , a great moral endeavor that, from Abraham Lincoln to Martin Luther King, Jr., was marked by religious fellowship, good will, generosity of heart, an emphasis on our shared principles, and an inclusive vision for the future. As these heroes demonstrated, the path to a renewed and confident national unity is through a rediscovery of a shared identity rooted in our founding principles. A loss of national confidence in these principles would place rising generations in jeopardy of a crippling self-doubt that could cause them to abandon faith in the common story that binds us to one another across our differences. Without our common faith in the equal right of every individual American to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, authoritarian visions of government and society could become increasingly alluring alternatives to self-government based on the consent of the people. Thus it is necessary to provide America's young people access to what is genuinely inspiring and unifying in our history, as well as to the lessons imparted by the American experience of overcoming great national challenges. This is what makes possible the informed and honest patriotism that is essential for a successful republic. A restoration of American education grounded in the principles of our founding that is accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling must ultimately succeed at the local level. Parents and local school boards must be empowered to achieve greater choice and variety in curriculum at the State and local levels. The role of the Federal Government is to protect and preserve State and local control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, and personnel of educational institutions, schools, and school systems. Indeed, that is why my Administration rejects the Common Core curriculum and all efforts to have the Federal Government impose a national curriculum or national standards in education. Vigorous participation in local government has always been America's laboratory of liberty and a key to what makes us exceptional. The best way to preserve the story of America's founding principles is to live it in action by local communities reasserting control of how children receive patriotic education in their schools. Sec. 2. The President's Advisory 1776 Commission. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Education shall establish in the Department of Education the President's Advisory 1776 Commission (\"the 1776 Commission\") to better enable a rising generation to understand the history and principles of the founding of the United States in 1776 and to strive to form a more perfect Union. (b) The 1776 Commission shall be composed of not more than 20 members, who shall be appointed by the President. Members shall serve for a term of 2 years and shall not be removed except for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. The 1776 Commission may include individuals from outside the Federal Government with relevant experience or subject-matter expertise. The 1776 Commission shall also include the following ex-officio members or such senior officials as those members may designate: (i) the Secretary of State; (ii) the Secretary of Defense; (iii) the Secretary of the Interior; (iv) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; (v) the Secretary of Education; (vi) the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy; and (vii) the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs. (c) The 1776 Commission shall: (i) produce a report for the President, within 1 year of the date of this order, which shall be publicly disseminated, regarding the core principles of the American founding and how these principles may be understood to further enjoyment of \"the blessings of liberty\" and to promote our striving \"to form a more perfect Union.\" The Commission may solicit statements and contributions from intellectual and cultural figures in addition to the views of the Commission members; (ii) advise and offer recommendations to the President and the United States Semiquincentennial Commission regarding the Federal Government's plans to celebrate the 250th anniversary of American Independence and coordinate with relevant external stakeholders on their plans; (iii) facilitate the development and implementation of a \"Presidential 1776 Award\" to recognize student knowledge of the American founding, including knowledge about the Founders, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitutional Convention, and the great soldiers and battles of the American Revolutionary War; (iv) advise executive departments and agencies (agencies) with regard to their efforts to ensure patriotic education , meaning the presentation of the history of the American founding and foundational principles, the examination of how the United States has grown closer to those principles throughout its history, and the explanation of why commitment to America's aspirations is beneficial and justified , is provided to the public at national parks, battlefields, monuments, museums, installations, landmarks, cemeteries, and other places important to the American Revolution and the American founding, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law; (v) advise agencies on prioritizing the American founding in Federal grants and initiatives, including those described in section 4 of this order, and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law; and (vi) facilitate, advise upon, and promote other activities to support public knowledge and patriotic education on the American Revolution and the American founding, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. (d) The 1776 Commission shall have a Chair and Vice Chair, designated by the President from among its members. An Executive Director, designated by the Secretary of Education in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, shall coordinate the work of the 1776 Commission. The Chair and Vice Chair shall work with the Executive Director to convene regular meetings of the 1776 Commission, determine its agenda, and direct its work, consistent with this order. (e) The Department of Education shall provide funding and administrative support for the 1776 Commission, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (f) Members of the 1776 Commission shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in the Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707). (g) Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), may apply to the 1776 Commission, any functions of the President under that Act, except that of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the Secretary of Education, in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Administrator of General Services. (h) The 1776 Commission shall terminate 2 years from the date of this order, unless extended by the President. Sec. 3. Celebration of Constitution Day. All relevant agencies shall monitor compliance with Title I of Division J of Public Law 108-447, which provides that \"each educational institution that receives Federal funds for a fiscal year shall hold an educational program on the United States Constitution on September 17 of such year for the students served by the educational institution,\" including by verifying compliance with each educational institution that receives Federal funds. All relevant agencies shall take action, as appropriate, to enhance compliance with that law. Sec. 4. Prioritize the American Founding in Available Federal Resources. The following agencies shall prioritize Federal resources, consistent with applicable law, to promote patriotic education: (a) the Department of Education, through the American History and Civics Academies and American History and Civics Education-National Activities; (b) the Department of Defense, through the Pilot Program on Enhanced Civics Education; and (c) the Department of State, through the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, and through opportunities in the Fulbright, U.S. Speakers, and International Visitors Leadership programs, as well as in American Spaces. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

{"SpeechID":"VSDT5112020347","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-11-05","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump on the Election","Type":"speech","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: Good evening. I'd like to provide the American people with an update on our efforts to protect the integrity of our very important 2020 election. If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late , we're looking at them very strongly. But a lot of votes came in late. I've already decisively won many critical states, including massive victories in Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, to name just a few. We won these and many other victories despite historic election interference from big media, big money, and big tech. As everybody saw, we won by historic numbers. And the pollsters got it knowingly wrong. They got it knowingly wrong. We had polls that were so ridiculous, and everybody knew that at the time. There was no blue wave that they predicted. They thought there was going to be a big blue wave; that was false. That was done for suppression reasons. But instead, there was a big red wave. And it's been properly acknowledged, actually, by the media. They were, I think, very impressed, but that was after the fact. That doesn't do us any good. We kept the Senate, despite having twice as many seats to defend as Democrats. And in a really , much more competitive states, we've , we did a fantastic job with the Senate, and I think we're very proud of what's happened there. We had many more seats to defend. They spent almost $200 million on Senate races in South Carolina and Kentucky alone , two races , and hundreds of millions of dollars overall against us. At the national level, our opponents' major donors were Wall Street bankers and special interests. Our major donors were police officers, farmers, everyday citizens. Yet for the first time ever, we lost zero races in the House. I was talking to Kevin McCarthy today. He said he couldn't believe it: zero races. Very unusual thing. Zero. And actually won many new seats with, I think, many more on the way. This was also the year of the Republican woman. More Republican women were elected to Congress than ever before. That's a great achievement. I won the largest share of non-white voters of any Republican in 60 years, including historic numbers of Latino, African American, Asian American, and Native American voters , the largest ever in our history. We grew our party by 4 million voters, the greatest turnout in Republican Party history. Democrats are the party of the big donors, the big media, the big tech, it seems. And Republicans have become the party of the American worker, and that's what's happened. And we're also, I believe, the party of inclusion. As everyone now recognizes, media polling was election interference, in the truest sense of that word, by powerful special interests. These really phony polls , I have to call them phony polls, fake polls , were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden, and diminish Republicans' ability to raise funds. They were what's called \"suppression polls.\" Everyone knows that now. And it's never been used to the extent that it's been used on this last election. To highlight just a few examples: The day before election, Quinnipiac , which was wrong on every occasion that I know of , had Joe Biden up by 5 points in Florida, and they were off by 8.4 points. And I won Florida easily. Easily. So, they had me losing Florida by a lot, and I ended up winning Florida by a lot. Other than that, they were very accurate. They had him up 4 points in Ohio, and they were off by 12.2 points. And I also won Ohio , the great state of Ohio , very easily. The Washington Post had Biden up 17 points in Wisconsin, and it was basically even. They were off by about 17 points, and they knew that. They're not stupid people. They knew that. Suppression. There are now only a few states yet to be decided in the presidential race. The voting apparatus of those states are run, in all cases, by Democrats. We were winning in all the key locations by a lot, actually. And then our number started miraculously getting whittled away in secret, and they wouldn't allow legally permissible observers. We went to court, in a couple of instances, and we were able to get the observers put in. And when the observers got there, they wanted them 60, 70 feet away, 80 feet, 100 feet away , or outside the building to observe people inside the building. And we won a case , a big case. And we have others happening. There are a lot of , lots of litigation. Even beyond our litigation, there's tremendous amount of litigation generally because of how unfair this process was, and I predicted that. I've been talking about mail-in voting for a long time. It's , it's really destroyed our system. It's a corrupt system. And it makes people corrupt even if they aren't by nature, but they become corrupt; it's too easy. They want to find out how many votes they need, and then they seem to be able to find them. They wait and wait, and then they find them. And you see that on Election Night. We were ahead in votes in North Carolina by a lot , tremendous number of votes. And we're still ahead by a lot, but not as many because they're finding ballots all of a sudden. \"Oh, we have some mail-in ballots.\" It's amazing how those mail-in ballots are so one-sided, too. I know that it's supposed to be to the advantage of the Democrats, but in all cases, they're so one-sided. We were up by nearly 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania. I won Pennsylvania by a lot, and that gets whittled down to , I think they said now we're up by 90,000 votes. And they'll keep coming and coming and coming. They find them all over. And they don't want us to have any observers, although we won a court case. The judge said you have to have observers. Likewise, in Geor- , and they're appealing. Actually, they're appealing. We won a case that we want people to watch and we want observers, and they're actually appealing, which is sort of interesting. I wonder why they'd appeal , that all we want to do is have people watch as they do the vote tabulations. Likewise, in Georgia, I won by a lot , a lot , with a lead of over , getting close to 300,000 votes on Election Night in Georgia. And, by the way, got whittled down, and now it's getting to be to a point where I'll go from winning by a lot to perhaps being even down a little bit. In Georgia, a pipe burst in a faraway location, totally unrelated to the location of what was happening, and they stopped counting for four hours, and a lot of things happened. The election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats. We also had margins of 300,000 in Michigan. We were way up in Michigan; won the state. And in Wisconsin, we did likewise fantastically well. And that got whittled down. Every , in every case, they got whittled down. Today, we're on track to win Arizona. We only need to carry, I guess, 55 percent of the remaining vote , 55 percent margins. And that's a margin that we've significantly exceeded. So we'll see what happens with that, but we're on track to do okay in Arizona. Our goal is to defend the integrity of the election. We'll not allow the corruption to steal such an important election or any election, for that matter. And we can't allow silence , anybody to silence our voters and manufacture results. I've never had , I've been doing a lot of public things for a long time; I've never had anything that's been as inspirational by people , calling, talking, sending things to us. I've never seen such , such love and such affection and such spirit as I've seen for this. People know what's happening, and they see what's happening, and it's before their eyes. And there are many instances which will be reported very shortly. There's tremendous litigation going on. And this is a case where they're trying to steal an election, they're trying to rig an election, and we can't let that happen. Detroit and Philadelphia , known as two of the most corrupt political places anywhere in our country, easily , cannot be responsible for engineering the outcome of a presidential race , a very important presidential race. In Pennsylvania, Democrats have gone to the State Supreme Court to try and ban our election observers, and very strongly. Now, we won the case, but they're , they're going forward. They don't want anybody in there. They don't want anybody watching them as they count the ballots, and I can't imagine why. There's absolutely no legitimate reason why they would not want to have people watching this process, because if it's straight, they would be , they should be proud of it. Instead, they're trying, obviously, to commit fraud. There's no question about that. In Philadelphia, observers have been kept far away , very far away , so far that people are using binoculars to try and see, and there's been tremendous problems caused. They put paper on all of the windows so you can't see in, and the people that are banned are very unhappy and become somewhat violent. The 11th Circuit ruled that, in Georgia, the votes have been in by Election Day , that they should be in by Election Day, and they weren't. Votes are coming in after Election Day. And they had a ruling already that you have to have the votes in by Election Day. To the best of my knowledge, votes should be in by Election Day, and they didn't do that. Democrat officials never believed they could win this election honestly. I really believe that. That's why they did the mail-in ballots, where there's tremendous corruption and fraud going on. That's why they mailed out tens of millions of unsolicited ballots without any verification measures whatsoever. And I've told everybody that these things would happen, because I've seen it happen. I watched a lot of different elections before they decided to go with this big, massive election with tens of millions of ballots going out to everybody , in many cases, totally unsolicited. This was unprecedented in American history. This was by design. Despite years of claiming to care about the election security, they refuse to include any requirement to verify signatures, identities, or even determine whether they're eligible or ineligible to vote. People are walking in that they have no idea; they're just taking numbers. They're writing down things , the workers , and doing a lot of bad things. And we have a lot of information coming and litigation that you'll see that will shake even you people up, and you've seen it all. The officials overseeing the counting in Pennsylvania and other key states are all part of a corrupt Democrat machine that you've written about , and, for a long time, you've been writing about the corrupt Democrat machine. I went to school there, and I know a lot about it. It hasn't changed. It's a long time ago, and it hasn't changed. It's gotten worse. In Pennsylvania, partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the state to be received three days after the election, and we think much more than that. And they are counting those without even postmarks or any identification whatsoever. So you don't have postmarks; you don't have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place. So you don't have postmarks; you don't have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place , and I wouldn't say has the best reputation for election integrity. Poll workers in Michigan were duplicating ballots. But when our observers attempted to challenge the activity, those poll workers jumped in front of the volunteers to block their view so that they couldn't see what they were doing, and it became a little bit dangerous. One major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows, again, with large pieces of cardboard. And so they wanted to protect and block the counting area. They didn't want anybody seeing the counting, even though these were observers who are legal observers that were supposed to be there. In Detroit, there were hours of unexplained delay in delivering many of the votes for counting. The final batch did not arrive until four in the morning and , even though the polls closed at eight o'clock. So they brought it in, and the batches came in, and nobody knew where they came from. We've also been denied access to observe in critical places in Georgia. In multiple swing states, counting was halted for hours and hours on Election Night, with results withheld from major Democrat-run locations, only to appear later. And they certainly appeared, and they all had the name \"Biden\" on them, or just about all , I think almost all. They all had the name \"Biden\" on them, which is a little strange. I challenge Joe and every Democrat to clarify that they only want legal votes. Because they talk about votes, and I think they should use the word \"legal\" , \"legal votes.\" \"We want every legal vote counted.\" And I want every legal vote counted. We want openness and transparency , no secret count rooms, no mystery ballots, no illegal votes being cast after Election Day. You have Election Day, and the laws are very strong on that. You have an Election Day. And they don't want votes cast after Election Day, and they want the process to be an honest one. It's so important. We want an honest election, and we want an honest count, and we want honest people working back there because it's a very important job. So that's the way this country is going to win. That's the way the United States will win. And we think we will win the election very easily. We think there's going to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence, so much proof. And it's going to end up, perhaps, at the highest court in the land. We'll see. But we think there'll be a lot of litigation because we can't have an election stolen by , like this. And I , I tell you, I would , I have been talking about this for many months with all of you. And I've said very strongly that mail-in ballots are going to end up being a disaster. Small elections were a disaster. Small, very easy-to-handle elections were disastrous. This is a large-scale version, and it's getting worse and worse every day. We're hearing stories that are horror stories , absolute horror stories. And we can't let that happen to the United States of America. It's not a question of who wins , Republican, Democrat; Joe, myself. We can't let that happen to our country. We can't be disgraced by having something like this happen. So it will be hopefully cleared up, maybe soon; I hope soon. But it'll probably go through a process , a legal process. And, as you know, I've claimed certain states and he's claiming states. So we can both claim the states, but ultimately I have a feeling judges are going to have to rule. But there's been a lot of shenanigans, and we can't stand for that in our country. Thank you very much.

We commit ourselves to stopping the spread of this oppressive ideology that, without fail, leaves in its wake misery, destruction, and death. As proud Americans who cherish the blessings of freedom and democracy, we promise to support the more than one billion people currently captive within communist regimes and denied their unalienable rights to life and liberty. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the decisive Polish victory against Vladimir Lenin's Bolsheviks in the Battle of Warsaw. Known as the Miracle on the Vistula, the Polish heroes of this battle halted the spread of communism in Europe for decades. Sadly, the Soviet Union erected an Iron Curtain around Poland and spread communism to neighboring countries and around the world.

This year marks the 100th anniversary of the decisive Polish victory against Vladimir Lenin's Bolsheviks in the Battle of Warsaw.

Please. And I just want to congratulate everybody. The Dow Jones Industrial Average just broke, for the first time in history, 30,000. It's now , (applause) , that's good. That's great for jobs, and it's good for everything. And this is the ninth time that we set a record during the course of 2020, and it's the 48th time that we've set the record during the Trump administration. And there's never been anything like that. So I just want to congratulate everybody that worked so hard: the White House, but maybe most importantly, the people of our country. It's a tremendous achievement. The First Lady and I are thrilled to welcome you all to the beautiful Rose Garden where the First Lady actually worked very hard on renovating it. It was 61 years , it was in rough shape. Very big job, actually, when you go to the wires underground. People have no idea how complex it is, but you've done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. (Applause.) And we're also very happy to have with us my daughter, Ivanka, and Jared and Theodore, Arabella, and Joseph. Thank you very much for coming. (Applause.) They like the turkey. Thank you very much. On behalf of the entire Trump family, I want to wish every American a healthy and very happy Thanksgiving. We're here today to continue a beloved annual tradition: the official presidential pardon of a very, very fortunate turkey, because Thanksgiving is a special day for turkeys , I guess, probably for the most part, not a very good one when you think about it. The first turkey to dodge the White House dinner table received unofficial clemency when President Abraham Lincoln's son, Tad, begged his father to spare his new friend. For the past 73 years, the National Turkey Federation has presented the National Thanksgiving Turkey to the President. Starting under President George H.W. Bush, these birds have received a formal pardon every single year. Today, it is my honor to present to you this year's lucky bird, Corn, and, just in case we needed him, Cob. Corn and Cob. That's not too hard to remember, is it? These two magnificent gobblers were selected from the official presidential flock of 30 turkeys, some real beauties. They were raised by the Chairman of the National Turkey Federation himself, Ron Kardel. Ron , thank you very much, Ron. Please, stand up. Great job. (Applause.) Ron, thank you for being here, and your family , beautiful family. Thank you very much for being here. Appreciate it. Like so many presidential flocks, this one started in the great state of Iowa in what can only been described as an act of blatant pandering. And, by the way, I love the state of Iowa. These two turkeys sought to win the support of Iowans across the state by naming themselves Corn and Cob. After today's ceremony, these birds will retire under the care of skilled veterinarians at Iowa State University, a tremendous university in Ames. Once there, people of all ages will be able to visit them and learn about poultry science, veterinary medicine, and the noble American tradition of farming. We love our farmers, I'll tell you. (Applause.) And we hope and we know that's going to happen , that Corn and Cob have a very long, happy, and memorable life. This year, our nation commemorates the 400th anniversary of the pilgrims landing on Plymouth Rock. After arriving in the New World, the brave men and women of the Mayflower endured a bitter and dangerous winter , very, very dangerous winter. Many were sick, most were starving, and all were praying for a miracle. Thankfully, God heard their prayers. From our earliest days, America has always been a story of perseverance and triumph, determination and strength, loyalty and faith. This week, in a time that is very unusual but in so many ways, very, very good , what we've endured and been able to endure, with the vaccines now coming out one after another. It's an incredible thing that happened. One of the greatest medical achievements that this planet has ever seen. But it's time to remember that we live in a great, great country , the greatest of them all. And there's nothing even close, as far as I'm concerned. Every American can be united in thanksgiving to God for the incredible gifts he has bestowed upon us: the blessings of family, community, and this exceptional, beautiful, and great country. It's greater than ever before. During this Thanksgiving, we extend our eternal gratitude to the doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, and scientists who have waged the battle against the China virus, and we give thanks for the vaccines and therapies that will soon end the pandemic. It's just , just such a tremendous feeling to know that they're coming, and they'll be coming probably starting next week, or shortly thereafter. We send our love to every member of the armed forces and the law enforcement heroes risking their lives to keep America safe, to keep America great, and, as I say, \"America first.\" Shouldn't go away from that: America first.

We ask that of God. Once again, Melania and I wish to thank everybody for your incredible courtesies and also wish you a Happy Thanksgiving. And now it's time for the moment of our guests of honor.

To foster goodwill between the recipients of United States foreign assistance and the American people, and to encourage the governments of nations that are receiving foreign assistance to support the United States, it is essential that recipients of United States foreign assistance be aware of the manifold efforts of American taxpayers to aid them and improve their lives. To further this awareness and to ensure United States foreign assistance supports the foreign policy objectives of the United States and maintains American influence and leadership, such assistance must appropriately and conspicuously be identified as American aid. Sec. 2. Establishment of Standard Federal Marking Regulations. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State (Secretary), in coordination with the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (Administrator) and the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies), as appropriate, shall initiate notice-and-comment rulemaking to brand and mark all United States foreign assistance provided under the FAA or any other law, including all assistance provided under humanitarian assistance or disaster relief programs, appropriately as \"American aid,\" consistent with section 641 of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2401). Such rulemaking to establish Federal marking regulations shall include proposing any amendments necessary to any existing regulations that may be appropriate to implement the directives set forth in this order. The agencies subject to these regulations shall implement them as soon as possible after they are finalized. (b) For the purposes of the standard Federal marking regulations described in section 2(a) of this order: (i) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the President will select a logo that embodies the values and generosity of the American people (\"single logo\"); and (ii) The single logo shall be prominently displayed on all materials related to United States foreign assistance programs, projects, and activities; on all communications and public affairs materials; on all foreign assistance goods and materials, and all packaging of such goods and materials; and on all rebranding of export packaging. The requirement to display the single logo shall not apply to purely administrative, non-deliverable items of contractors and recipients of United States foreign assistance or to the corporate or non-project materials of agencies that are not tied to projects funded under the FAA, and shall not require the rebranding of completed projects or products overseas.

{"SpeechID":"VSDT1412202032","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-12-14","SpeechTitle":"Executive Order on Increasing Economic and Geographic Mobility","Type":"statement","RawText":"By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 305 of title 5, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy and Principles. As expressed in Executive Order 13777 of February 24, 2017 (Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda), it is the policy of the United States to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people. Overly burdensome occupational licensing requirements can impede job creation and slow economic growth, which undermines our Nation's prosperity and the economic well\u2011being of the American people. Such regulations can prevent American workers and job seekers from earning a living, maximizing their personal and economic potential, and achieving the American Dream. The purpose of this order is to reduce the burden of occupational regulations in order to promote the free practice of commerce, lower consumer costs, and increase economic and geographic mobility, including for military spouses. My Administration is committed to continuing this important work by partnering with State, local, territorial, and tribal leaders throughout the country to eliminate harmful occupational regulations, which are frequently designed to protect politically connected interest groups. To this end, in October 2019, my Administration announced the establishment of the Governors' Initiative on Regulatory Innovation, which works with State, local, and tribal leaders to advance occupational licensing reforms, better align State and Federal regulations, and eliminate unnecessary regulations that drive up consumer costs. Occupational regulations can protect practitioners from competition rather than protect the public from malpractice. Unfortunately, the number of occupational regulations has substantially increased over the last few decades. Since the 1950s, the percentage of jobs requiring a government-mandated occupational license has increased from less than 5 percent to between 25 and 30 percent. By requiring workers to acquire new licenses when they move to a new jurisdiction, occupational regulations reduce worker mobility, disproportionately harm low\u2011income Americans, and are particularly burdensome to military spouses who must relocate to support the service members committed to keeping our country safe. Additionally, blanket prohibitions that prevent individuals with criminal records from obtaining occupational licenses may exacerbate disparities in employment opportunity and increase the likelihood of recidivism, particularly as regulatory barriers to enter lower- and middle-income occupations are associated with higher recidivism rates. Licensing requirements unnecessary to protect consumers from significant and demonstrable harm also frequently impose expensive educational requirements on potential job seekers, even for occupations with limited future earnings potential. According to recent research, licensing requirements have cost our country an estimated 2.85 million jobs and over $200 billion annually in increased consumer costs. Therefore, it is the policy of the United States Government to support occupational regulation reform throughout the Nation, building on occupational licensing reforms enacted most recently in Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, and South Dakota, guided by six principles: Principle 1. All recognized occupational licensure boards should be subject to active supervision of a designated governmental agency or office. Principle 2. All occupational licensure boards recognized by a State, territorial, or tribal government that oversee personal qualifications related to the practice of an occupation should adopt and maintain the criteria and methods of occupational regulation that are least restrictive to competition sufficient to protect consumers from significant and demonstrable harm to their health and safety. The policies and procedures of such boards should be designed to protect consumer and worker safety and to encourage competition. Principle 3. State, territorial, and tribal governments should review existing occupational regulations, including associated scope-of-practice provisions, to ensure that their requirements are the least restrictive to competition sufficient to protect consumers from significant and demonstrable harm. State, territorial, and tribal governments should also regularly review and analyze all occupational regulations, including associated personal qualifications required to obtain an occupational license, to ensure the adoption of the least restrictive requirements necessary to protect consumers from significant and demonstrable harm. Principle 4. Individuals with criminal records should be encouraged to submit to the appropriate licensure board a preliminary application for an occupational license for a determination as to whether the criminal record would preclude their attainment of the appropriate occupational license. Principle 5. A State, territorial, or tribal government should issue an occupational license to a person in the discipline applied for and at the same level of practice if the individual satisfies four requirements: (a) the individual holds an occupational license for that discipline from another jurisdiction in the United States and is in good standing; (b) the individual verifies having met, as applicable, the minimum examination, education, work, or clinical-supervision requirements imposed by the State, territory, or tribe; (c) the individual: (i) has not had the license previously revoked or suspended; (ii) has not been disciplined related to the license by any other regulating entity; and (iii) is not subject to any pending complaint, allegation, or investigation related to the license; and (d) the individual pays all applicable fees required to obtain the new license. Principle 6. Accommodations should be made for any applicant for an occupational license who is the spouse of an active duty member of the uniformed services and who is relocating with the member due to the member's official permanent change of station orders. Sec. 2. Review of and Report on Authorities, Regulations, Guidance, and Policies. The head of each executive department and agency (agency) shall, within 90 days of the date of this order and every 2 years thereafter: (a) review the agency's authorities, regulations, guidance, and polices to identify changes necessary to ensure alignment with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order; and (b) submit a report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director of OMB), the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs (Director of IGA) identifying all necessary changes identified pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. Sec. 3. Identification and Report of Opportunities to Encourage Occupational Regulation Reform. (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, and every 2 years thereafter, the head of each agency shall submit a report to the Director of OMB, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Director of IGA identifying a list of recommended actions available to any and all agencies to recognize and reward State, territorial, and tribal governments that have in place policies and procedures regarding occupational regulation that are consistent with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order; and (b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, and every 2 years thereafter, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Director of OMB, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, the Director of IGA, and the heads of other agencies and offices as appropriate, shall submit a report to the President identifying: (i) recommended changes to Federal law, regulations, guidance, and other policies to ensure alignment with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order; (ii) recommended actions to be taken by agencies to recognize and reward State, territorial, and tribal governments that have in place policies and procedures regarding occupational regulation that are consistent with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order; and (iii) a list of criteria that may be used to evaluate whether a State, territorial, or tribal government has in place policies and procedures that are consistent with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order. Sec. 4. Implementation of Recommendations to Recognize and Reward State, Territorial, and Tribal Regulatory Reform. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, and every 2 years thereafter, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall seek and report on information from State, territorial, and tribal governments regarding whether they have in place policies and procedures consistent with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order and shall make the report publicly available, including on agencies' websites. The information sought shall be consistent with the criteria identified as required by section 3(b)(iii) of this order. (b) Consistent with applicable law, and to the extent that the President approves any of the actions recommended pursuant to section 3(b)(ii) of this order, agencies shall implement such actions for the purpose of recognizing and rewarding a State, territorial, or tribal government that has in place policies and procedures regarding occupational regulation that are consistent with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order. Sec. 5. Definitions. For the purposes of this order:(a) \"Active supervision\" means: (i) reviewing proposed occupational licensure board rules, policies, or other regulatory actions that may restrict market competition prior to issuance; (ii) ensuring that any entity seeking to impose occupational licensing criteria adopts the criteria that are least restrictive to competition sufficient to protect consumers from significant and demonstrable harm to their health or safety; and (iii) analyzing, where information is readily available, the effects of proposed rules, policies, and other regulatory actions on employment opportunities, consumer costs, market competition, and administrative costs. (b) \"Agency\" has the meaning given that term in section 3502(1) of title 44, United States Code, except that the term does not include the agencies described in section 3502(5) of title 44, United States Code, other than the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. (c) \"Occupational license\" means a license, registration, or certification without which an individual lacks the legal permission of a State, local, territorial, or tribal government to perform certain defined services for compensation. (d) \"Occupational regulation\" includes: (i) licensing or government certification, by which a government body requires personal qualifications in order to be permitted to practice an occupation; and (ii) registration, bonding, or inspections, by which a government body does not require personal qualifications in order to be permitted to practice an occupation. Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Over 50 years ago, Americans produced one of history's most triumphant achievements by taking 'one small step for man' and 'one giant leap for mankind.' As our beautiful American Flag was planted on the Moon's surface, it was clear what had brought humans to this new and wondrous frontier, the American spirit. One year ago, we opened another chapter in the extraordinary history of American leadership in space, and strengthened America's heritage as the world's greatest arsenal of democracy. Today, I commend the brave Americans who have taken their oath and joined the Space Force's ranks, and the many more yet to join, for taking another giant leap toward a brighter future for all. Now, we stand at the birth of a new era.

{"SpeechID":"VSDT2812202019","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2020-12-28","SpeechTitle":"Executive Order on Expanding Educational Opportunity Through School Choice","Type":"statement","RawText":"By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure the education, health, safety, and well-being of America's children, our most essential resource upon which the future of our great Nation depends, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Purpose. As part of their efforts to address the public health challenges and uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, State and local officials shut down in-person learning for the vast majority of our more than 56 million elementary and secondary school students beginning in late February and early March of this year. Since then, however, our Nation has identified effective measures to facilitate the safe resumption of in-person learning, and the Federal Government has provided more than $13 billion to States and school districts to implement those measures. The prolonged deprivation of in-person learning opportunities has produced undeniably dire consequences for the children of this country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that school attendance is negatively correlated with a child's risk of depression and various types of abuse. States have seen substantial declines in reports of child maltreatment while school buildings have been closed, indicating that allegations are going unreported. These reductions are driven in part by social isolation from the schoolteachers and support staff with whom students typically interact and who have an obligation to report suspected child maltreatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has also found that school closures have a \"substantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and families.\" Additionally, a recent survey of educators found student absences from school, including virtual learning, have nearly doubled during the pandemic, and as AAP has noted, chronic absenteeism is associated with alcohol and drug use, teenage pregnancy, juvenile delinquency, and suicide attempts. School closures are especially difficult for families with children with special needs. Schools provide not only academic supports for students with special needs, but they also provide much-needed in-person therapies and services, including physical and occupational therapies. A recent survey found that 80 percent of children with special needs are not receiving the services and supports to which they are entitled and that approximately 40 percent of children with special needs are receiving no services or supports. Moreover, the survey found that virtual learning may not be fully accessible to these students, as children with special needs are twice as likely to receive little or no remote learning and to be dissatisfied with the remote learning received. Low-income and minority children are also disproportionately affected by school closures. In low-income zip codes, students' math progress decreased by nearly 50 percent while school buildings were closed in the spring, and the math progress of students in middle-income zip codes fell by almost a third during the same period. A recent analysis projected that, if in-person classes do not fully resume until January 2021, Hispanic, Black, and low-income students will lose 9.2, 10.3, and 12.4 months of learning, respectively. A failure to quickly resume in-person learning options is likely to have long-term economic effects on children and their families. According to a recent study, if in person classes do not fully resume until January 2021, the average student could lose $61,000 to $82,000 in lifetime earnings, or the equivalent of a year of full-time work. Additionally, in 2019, more than 90 percent of children under the age of 18 had at least one employed parent. Many employed parents do not have the option of engaging in remote work that allows them the flexibility to supervise their children during the day when in-person learning options are not available. Without the resumption of in-person learning opportunities, the economic and social harms resulting from such lost employment opportunities will continue to compound. To help mitigate these harms, the Department of Health and Human Services recently announced additional relief for low income parents by allowing States to use funds available through the Child Care and Development Fund to subsidize child care services and services that supplement academic instruction for children under the age of 13 who are participating in virtual instruction. Nevertheless, virtual instruction is an inadequate substitute for in-person learning opportunities and this aid is insufficient to meet current needs. While some families, especially those with financial means, have been able to mitigate school disruptions through in person options such as homeschooling, private schools, charter schools, and innovative models like microschools and \"learning pods,\" for many families, their children's residentially assigned public school remains their only financially available option. Unfortunately, more than 50 percent of all public-school students in the United States began school remotely this fall. These children, including those with special needs, are being underserved due to the public education system's failure to provide in-person learning options. Students whose families pay tuition for their education are also facing significant hardships due to the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. Scores of private schools, including approximately 100 Catholic schools, have permanently closed since the onset of COVID-19, and more than half of our Nation's private schools are believed to have lost enrollment due to the pandemic. These closures and declining enrollments are harmful to students, bad for communities, and likely to impose increased strain on public school systems. I am committed to ensuring that all children of our great Nation have access to the educational resources they need to obtain a high-quality education and to improving students' safety and well-being, including by empowering families with emergency learning scholarships. Sec. 2. Providing Emergency Learning Scholarships for Students. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take steps, consistent with law, to allow funds available through the Community Services Block Grant program to be used by grantees and eligible entities to provide emergency learning scholarships to disadvantaged families for use by any child without access to in-person learning. These scholarships may be used for: (i) tuition and fees for a private or parochial school; (ii) homeschool, microschool, or learning-pod costs; (iii) special education and related services, including therapies; or (iv) tutoring or remedial education. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Additionally, a recent survey of educators found student absences from school, including virtual learning, have nearly doubled during the pandemic, and as AAP has noted, chronic absenteeism is associated with alcohol and drug use, teenage pregnancy, juvenile delinquency, and suicide attempts. School closures are especially difficult for families with children with special needs. Schools provide not only academic supports for students with special needs, but they also provide much-needed in-person therapies and services, including physical and occupational therapies. A recent survey found that 80 percent of children with special needs are not receiving the services and supports to which they are entitled and that approximately 40 percent of children with special needs are receiving no services or supports. Moreover, the survey found that virtual learning may not be fully accessible to these students, as children with special needs are twice as likely to receive little or no remote learning and to be dissatisfied with the remote learning received. Low-income and minority children are also disproportionately affected by school closures. In low-income zip codes, students' math progress decreased by nearly 50 percent while school buildings were closed in the spring, and the math progress of students in middle-income zip codes fell by almost a third during the same period. A recent analysis projected that, if in-person classes do not fully resume until January 2021, Hispanic, Black, and low-income students will lose 9.2, 10.3, and 12.4 months of learning, respectively. A failure to quickly resume in-person learning options is likely to have long-term economic effects on children and their families. According to a recent study, if in person classes do not fully resume until January 2021, the average student could lose $61,000 to $82,000 in lifetime earnings, or the equivalent of a year of full-time work. Additionally, in 2019, more than 90 percent of children under the age of 18 had at least one employed parent. Many employed parents do not have the option of engaging in remote work that allows them the flexibility to supervise their children during the day when in-person learning options are not available. Without the resumption of in-person learning opportunities, the economic and social harms resulting from such lost employment opportunities will continue to compound. To help mitigate these harms, the Department of Health and Human Services recently announced additional relief for low income parents by allowing States to use funds available through the Child Care and Development Fund to subsidize child care services and services that supplement academic instruction for children under the age of 13 who are participating in virtual instruction. Nevertheless, virtual instruction is an inadequate substitute for in-person learning opportunities and this aid is insufficient to meet current needs. While some families, especially those with financial means, have been able to mitigate school disruptions through in person options such as homeschooling, private schools, charter schools, and innovative models like microschools and 'learning pods,' for many families, their children's residentially assigned public school remains their only financially available option. Unfortunately, more than 50 percent of all public-school students in the United States began school remotely this fall. These children, including those with special needs, are being underserved due to the public education system's failure to provide in-person learning options. Students whose families pay tuition for their education are also facing significant hardships due to the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. Scores of private schools, including approximately 100 Catholic schools, have permanently closed since the onset of COVID-19, and more than half of our Nation's private schools are believed to have lost enrollment due to the pandemic. These closures and declining enrollments are harmful to students, bad for communities, and likely to impose increased strain on public school systems. I am committed to ensuring that all children of our great Nation have access to the educational resources they need to obtain a high-quality education and to improving students' safety and well-being, including by empowering families with emergency learning scholarships. Sec. 2. Providing Emergency Learning Scholarships for Students. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take steps, consistent with law, to allow funds available through the Community Services Block Grant program to be used by grantees and eligible entities to provide emergency learning scholarships to disadvantaged families for use by any child without access to in-person learning. These scholarships may be used for: (i) tuition and fees for a private or parochial school; (ii) homeschool, microschool, or learning-pod costs; (i) special education and related services, including therapies; or (iv) tutoring or remedial education. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person"}

Thank you, everybody. Great honor to be here. We worked long and hard. Please sit down. We've worked long and hard to get this done. They said it couldn't be done, and we got it done. One of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of our country. I'm honored to be here in the Rio Grande Valley with the courageous men and women of Customs and Border Patrol. These people are incredible. They're really incredible. I've gotten to know you very well over the last four years. Many of you are friends from all of the work we did in designing the wall. We got it exactly as you wanted it , everything , including your protective plate on top. I'd say, \"Why did we put that?\" And they said, \"We need it for extra protection.\" Climb plate. And we have everything you want. It's steel. It's concrete inside the steel. And then it's rebar , a lot of heavy rebar inside the concrete. And it's as strong as you're going to get and strong as you can have. But we gave you 100 percent of what you wanted. So now you have no excuses. I didn't want you to have any excuses. (Laughter.) And you set records. And we can't let the next administration even think about taking it down, if you can believe that. I don't think that will happen. I think when you see what it does and how it's so important for our country, nobody is going to be touching it. And you are very proud of it, and you're proud of the work you did, because we really designed it together. We're joined together to celebrate a great achievement: the extraordinarily successful building of the wall on the southern border. Before we begin, I'd like to say that free speech is under assault like never before. The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration. As the expression goes: Be careful what you wish for. The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country, and it is causing tremendous anger and division and pain , far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time. And now I'd like to briefly address the events of last week. Millions of our citizens watched on Wednesday as a mob stormed the Capitol and trashed the halls of government. As I have consistently said throughout my administration, we believe in respecting America's history and traditions, not tearing them down. We believe in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting. Because of the pandemic , horrible, horrible invisible enemy , and despite our tremendous success developing a vaccine years before it was thought evenly remotely possible. Nobody thought it was going to be possible. They said would take five years. \"Sir, it will take seven years.\" All of our scientists were saying , our advisors, \"It will take 7 years, 5 years, 10 years maybe.\" Well, we did it just like I said we would. And we had it out years and years before they thought it was possible. And we're now delivering it to states, including your state, where your governor and government are doing a terrific job in getting it administered in Texas. And Florida is doing great. Some of them are doing great. Some aren't doing as well, but they have all they can handle. And we get it to them as fast as they need it, and even faster. But they're calling it a \"medical miracle.\" And this has been a difficult year and a very difficult election. The pandemic has made it a very, very difficult year for our country and virtually every country all over the world. Now is the time for our nation to heal, and it's time for peace and for calm. Respect for law enforcement and the great people within law enforcement , so many are here , is the foundation of the MAGA agenda. And we're a nation of law, and we're a nation of order. That is why we're here today, to talk about what we must do to uphold the rule of law in America and how we must continue to support our law enforcement heroes, which is exactly what you are. Do you feel like a hero? Yeah, I think you do. Right? (Applause.) You do and you are. I want to thank Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgan, who's been incredible. Where is Mark? Mark? Stand up, Mark. Great job. Fantastic. (Applause.) Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings. Brian, thank you very much. Great job. (Applause.) He's so happy with it. He said, \"Sir, this really works.\" And most importantly, the brave law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day to protect our families and our country. I also want to thank a tremendous gentleman, a friend of mine, Tom Homan. He's a great American patriot, and he was with us right from the beginning. (Applause.) Right, Tom? You knew exactly , he said, \"We need a wall,\" when they were saying, \"No, no, we need drones. We need drones.\" I said, \"Why? So you can watch the people pour into our country illegally?\" And I want to thank you very much, Tom. What a , what a professional job you've done. All of you people, incredible. Everyone here today is part of an incredible success story. This is a real success story. When I took office, we inherited a broken, dysfunctional, and open border. Everybody was pouring in at will. Working alongside the heroes in this great outdoor space, looking at our wall, we reformed our immigration system and achieved the most secure southern border in U.S. history. It is at a level that it's never been before. We took on the cartels, the coyotes, and the special interests, and we restored the rule of law. For years, politicians ran for office promising to secure the border, only to get elected and to do the absolute exact opposite. They even promised a wall. If you remember, about 10 years ago, they promised a wall but they couldn't get it built. It wasn't easy getting it built. Getting it financed was tough. Getting it built was even tougher. All the different chains of title and all the different things we had to go through , very, very complex and very difficult, but we got it done. But they had it years ago. You remember that better than anybody. Right? And they never got it done. They never, ever completed the task. And then, ultimately, the money was sent back to the federal government. Spent, but no wall was built. But unlike those who came before me, I kept my promises. And today we celebrate an extraordinary milestone: the completion of the promised 450 miles of border wall. Four hundred and fifty miles. Nobody realizes how big that is. (Applause.) I remember when I first came down, about a year and a half ago: We're under construction, and I started walking, and I'm looking at the wall, and I'm walking and walking. And I'm used to, like, a development project where you could walk a wall. You know, 10 acres, 5 acres, 2 acres, 1 acre. Then I realized that's a long time; that's a big walk. A lot of it , a lot of the wall you have is incredibly natural. It's , you have the mountains. You have the rivers. You have some very powerful water areas. You have some areas that are virtually impossible to get by. So we didn't need walls everywhere, but where we needed them , because it's been so successful that we've added nearly 300 miles. And that's currently under construction. This was our original wish: to get these areas done where it was such trouble. And now we have it. It's either in construction or pre-construction , an additional 300 miles. In every region that we've built the wall, illegal crossings and drug smuggling have plummeted. Absolutely plummeted. In the Rio Grande Valley, crossings have dropped nearly 80 percent. In Yuma, Arizona, illegal entries have been slashed by 90 percent. Nationwide, ICE and Border Patrol have seized over 2 million pounds of fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other deadly narcotics, saving thousands and thousands of lives. We've arrested nearly 500,000 illegal aliens with criminal records , some with very serious criminal records of the type you don't want to know about, like murder. We removed nearly 20,000 gang members from the United States, including 4,500 members of MS-13 , probably the worst gang of them all. Through the landmark reforms we've put into place, we have ended the immigration chaos and reestablished American sovereignty. Our most important reform was ending catch and release , not easy to do; you're dealing with Congress; it's very, very difficult , which is the functional equivalent of open borders, but even worse: It's catch and release them. It means release into our country, not into another country. This policy was exploited by vicious criminal organizations, who understood the laws better than our people understood them for years, to spread misery and suffering and drugs all across the hemisphere. Now, instead of \"catch and release,\" we have \"detain and remove.\" It's called \"detain and remove.\" Doesn't that sound better? One of the biggest loopholes we closed was asylum fraud. Under the old, broken system, if you merely requested asylum, you were released into the country. The most ridiculous thing anyone has ever seen. And we were taking in some people that you didn't want to have in your country. We instituted a series of historic policy changes to shut down asylum fraud, and that's what we did. This includes the groundbreaking agreement with Mexico known as the \"Migrant Protection Protocols,\" or MPP. Under this agreement, if an illegal alien requests asylum, they have to wait in Mexico until their case is heard. They used to wait here. And when they were waiting, they would say \"bye-bye,\" and they'd disappear somewhere into our country, and essentially we'd never find them again, would never see them again. This one measure alone ended a humanitarian crisis and saved countless lives, and especially, I have to say, lives from crime. I want to thank the great President of Mexico. He is a great gentleman, a friend of mine. And President Obrador , he is a man who really knows what's happening. And he loves his country, and he also loves the United States. But I want to thank for his friendship and his professional working relationship. We actually had 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding our borders over the last two years. Nobody thought that was possible. And they made it very, very difficult, and that's why the numbers were able to plunge, even during the construction of the wall. And, by the way, one of the big elements of the wall that make it so successful is we can have far fewer people working. Now, they can be working on other things , other things related to crime and drug prevention and a lot of other elements they're working on, because we saved massive numbers of people. And included here we have the most sophisticated camera systems and most sophisticated electronic systems anywhere in the world. We implemented three historic agreements with the Northern Triangle; that's Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Under these critical asylum cooperation agreements, the burden of illegal immigration is now shared all across the region. Now, when an illegal immigrant is arrested at our border, they can be sent to a neighboring country instead of into a U.S. community. Prior to my getting here, countries wouldn't accept them. They would say, \"No, no, no.\" I said, \"Well, you got to take them.\" First month , I'll never forget , these gentlemen, right here, came to me. They said, \"They won't take them back.\" They came. They may be murderers. They may be cartel heads. They may be some really vicious people. The countries didn't want them back. And I stopped all payments to those countries. I stopped everything going to those countries. And after it was stopped for about a month , you remember? , after it was stopped for about a month, they called. They said, \"We'd love to have them back.\" And I never gave them as much money as they were getting, by the way, but they got some. (Applause.) It was amazing. And you people know better than anyone: They wouldn't take them back. We'd have planes flying over, loaded up with people that we didn't want here. And they'd say, \"Don't ever even think about landing that plane.\" And they'd take them by boat, and they'd take them by bus, and they wouldn't let them into their countries. And all of a sudden, they say, \"Welcome back. We love having you.\" So it was a great thing. And now they do take them back. And the relationship with those countries , the Triangle , the relationship is a much better one than it was before. In addition to our agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, we have systematically reformed the regulatory code to return asylum to its original legal meaning and purpose , not a free ticket for entry. A recent comprehensive report by the Department of Homeland Security and Justice show how effective our reforms have been and how disastrous their removal would be. It would be a disaster for our country. I know they're thinking about removing them. I hope they don't do that. I hope they don't do that. It'll be a absolute travesty for our country. The report conclusively proves, once and for all, that aliens released at the border remain at large in the country and do not return home. They won't go home. And you rarely find them. It's very tough to find them. So we have aliens released in our country, many of whom are serious criminals. And we've stopped that. Don't ever start that process again. By contrast, under our policies, 98 percent of aliens that remain in DHS custody are removed. Simply put, if you enter the United States illegally, you are apprehended and immediately safely removed from our country. Without this core principle, there is no border, there is no law, there is no order. My administration also instituted vital public health measures on the border. In response to the China virus, under Title 42 of the U.S. Code, illegal immigrants are being promptly removed to protect the health of border agents, other migrants, and local communities, and the public at large. Removing these protections would invite a public health catastrophe of epic proportions. As you probably know, in Tijuana, various parts of Mexico, the COVID , it's got about 24 names I can call it, from \"COVID\" to \"China virus.\" I can call it the \"plague.\" I call it the \"China plague.\" A lot of different names. But we always call it the \"invisible enemy.\" But the invisible enemy has been very tough on Mexico, and we have areas along the border where we're in great shape because right there, because of that, that we're in great shape. But on the other side, in Mexico, they're suffering greatly with the virus. It's been incredible what we've achieved. And we didn't do the wall because of COVID; we did the wall because of security and drugs and other things. But it turned out that, in the middle of it all, along came this horrible plague. We inherited a dangerously lawless border. The people that work here are unbelievably brave. I've seen what they have to endure, what they have to go through. They're tough, they're strong, and they're great patriots, great Americans. We fixed it and we secured it. We empowered our wonderful ICE and Border Patrol to fulfill their oaths and sworn officers. They became sworn officers of the law. And they love their job. It's a tough job. It's a nasty job. They're not paid what they should be paid, to be honest, but we got you up. We got you up. But these are incredibly talented people that could probably do a lot better, in terms of economics, than they do here. But they love what they do, and they love their country. We also put into place vital measures to protect American workers, keep out terrorists, and stop the abuse of our welfare system , where they'd come up, go on our welfare system, and live for years on American welfare without ever having a job. We also have, and we had , but we have them all the time , we have terrorists from the Middle East coming into our country through the southern border. That was before what you see right here, because it was easier to come into our country through the southern border than it was through airports or any other means. So they'd land in South America, and they'd work their way up, and they'd come into our country. And these are not people from the countries that you would suspect. These are people from some very seriously dangerous places in the Middle East. And the numbers are far greater than anybody would understand. Really far greater. Removing any of these measures would hamstring our workers, endanger our country, and cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year. No matter our party, we should all agree on the need to protect our workers, our families, and our citizens of all backgrounds, no matter who they are. In particular, if our border security measures are reversed, it will trigger a tidal wave of illegal immigration , a wave like you've never seen before. And I can tell you that, already, waves are starting to come up from 2,000 and 1,000 and 500 miles away. We see what's coming. And they're coming because they think that it's gravy train at the end; it's going to be a gravy train. Change the name from the \"caravans,\" which I think we came up with, to the \"gravy train,\" because that's what they're looking for , looking for the gravy. This will be an unmitigated calamity for national security, public safety, and public health. It would destroy millions and millions of jobs and claim thousands of innocent lives. The policies I put into place are uniformly and strongly supported by the men and women of ICE and Border Patrol. We worked on them together, just like we did on the wall. We worked on the policies together because nobody knows this whole world better than the incredible people right in front of me. To terminate those policies is knowingly to put America in really serious danger and to override the great career experts that have worked so hard , those from DHS. At this very moment, smugglers and coyotes are preparing to surge the border if our policies are loosened or removed. I mean, they're literally waiting , big, big groups of people. Some of them very unsavory, I might add. This is an entirely preventable tragedy. It's waiting to happen. The safety of our nation must come before politics. We have many disagreements in the country, but we should all agree: the urgent need to secure our borders, protect our homeland, and allow law enforcement to fulfill its mission without political interference. ICE and Border Patrol agents swore a sacred oath to uphold the law, and no political appointee should ever order them to violate that oath. These are real experts. They really get it. And I'll tell you who else gets it: The Hispanic population of our country gets it. Because not only did I win Texas in historic numbers, but I won border towns, which are largely Hispanic, and people were amazed to see that. And the numbers, they say, were , the Governor of Texas called , Greg , great guy, great governor , called. He said, \"You had numbers that nobody has had since Reconstruction. \"Reconstruction\" means \"Civil War.\" And largely Hispanic. They understand it better than anybody, and they want law enforcement to help them , help them live safe lives. The laws that Congress passed must be upheld. To the men and women of ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and all across DHS, law enforcement in general: You have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation. You have no idea how much our nation loves you and respects you. I don't think you do have an idea, but it's true. I only hope and pray that your voice will be heard, honored, heeded, and respected long into the future. God bless you. God bless law enforcement. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great job. (Applause.)

Thank you, everybody. Great honor to be here. We worked long and hard. Please sit down. We've worked long and hard to get this done. They said it couldn't be done, and we got it done. One of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of our country. I'm honored to be here in the Rio Grande Valley with the courageous men and women of Customs and Border Patrol. These people are incredible. They're really incredible. I've gotten to know you very well over the last four years. Many of you are friends from all of the work we did in designing the wall. We got it exactly as you wanted it , everything , including your protective plate on top. I'd say, 'Why did we put that?' And they said, 'We need it for extra protection.' Climb plate. And we have everything you want. It's steel. It's concrete inside the steel. And then it's rebar , a lot of heavy rebar inside the concrete. And it's as strong as you're going to get and strong as you can have. But we gave you 100 percent of what you wanted. So now you have no excuses. I didn't want you to have any excuses. (Laughter.) And you set records. And we can't let the next administration even think about taking it down, if you can believe that. I don't think that will happen. I think when you see what it does and how it's so important for our country, nobody is going to be touching it. And you are very proud of it, and you're proud of the work you did, because we really designed it together. We're joined together to celebrate a great achievement: the extraordinarily successful building of the wall on the southern border. Before we begin, I'd like to say that free speech is under assault like never before. The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration. As the expression goes: Be careful what you wish for. The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country, and it is causing tremendous anger and division and pain , far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time. And now I'd like to briefly address the events of last week. Millions of our citizens watched on Wednesday as a mob stormed the Capitol and trashed the halls of government. As I have consistently said throughout my administration, we believe in respecting America's history and traditions, not tearing them down. We believe in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting. Because of the pandemic , horrible, horrible invisible enemy , and despite our tremendous success developing a vaccine years before it was thought evenly remotely possible. Nobody thought it was going to be possible. They said would take five years. 'Sir, it will take seven years.' All of our scientists were saying , our advisors, 'It will take 7 years, 5 years, 10 years maybe.' Well, we did it just like I said we would. And we had it out years and years before they thought it was possible. And we're now delivering it to states, including your state, where your governor and government are doing a terrific job in getting it administered in Texas. And Florida is doing great. Some of them are doing great. Some aren't doing as well, but they have all they can handle. And we get it to them as fast as they need it, and even faster. But they're calling it a 'medical miracle.' And this has been a difficult year and a very difficult election. The pandemic has made it a very, very difficult year for our country and virtually every country all over the world. Now is the time for our nation to heal, and it's time for peace and for calm. Respect for law enforcement and the great people within law enforcement , so many are here , is the foundation of the MAGA agenda. And we're a nation of law, and we're a nation of order. That is why we're here today, to talk about what we must do to uphold the rule of law in America and how we must continue to support our law enforcement heroes, which is exactly what you are. Do you feel like a hero? Yeah, I think you do. Right? (Applause.) You do and you are. I want to thank Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgan, who's been incredible. Where is Mark? Mark? Stand up, Mark. Great job. Fantastic. (Applause.) Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings. Brian, thank you very much. Great job. (Applause.) He's so happy with it. He said, 'Sir, this really works.' And most importantly, the brave law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day to protect our families and our country. I also want to thank a tremendous gentleman, a friend of mine, Tom Homan. He's a great American patriot, and he was with us right from the beginning. (Applause.) Right, Tom? You knew exactly , he said, 'We need a wall,' when they were saying, 'No, no, we need drones. We need drones.' I said, 'Why? So you can watch the people pour into our country illegally?' And I want to thank you very much, Tom. What a , what a professional job you've done. All of you people, incredible. Everyone here today is part of an incredible success story. This is a real success story. When I took office, we inherited a broken, dysfunctional, and open border. Everybody was pouring in at will. Working alongside the heroes in this great outdoor space, looking at our wall, we reformed our immigration system and achieved the most secure southern border in U.S. history. It is at a level that it's never been before. We took on the cartels, the coyotes, and the special interests, and we restored the rule of law. For years, politicians ran for office promising to secure the border, only to get elected and to do the absolute exact opposite. They even promised a wall. If you remember, about 10 years ago, they promised a wall but they couldn't get it built. It wasn't easy getting it built. Getting it financed was tough. Getting it built was even tougher. All the different chains of title and all the different things we had to go through , very, very complex and very difficult, but we got it done. But they had it years ago. You remember that better than anybody. Right? And they never got it done. They never, ever completed the task. And then, ultimately, the money was sent back to the federal government. Spent, but no wall was built. But unlike those who came before me, I kept my promises. And today we celebrate an extraordinary milestone: the completion of the promised 450 miles of border wall. Four hundred and fifty miles. Nobody realizes how big that is. (Applause.) I remember when I first came down, about a year and a half ago: We're under construction, and I started walking, and I'm looking at the wall, and I'm walking and walking. And I'm used to, like, a development project where you could walk a wall. You know, 10 acres, 5 acres, 2 acres, 1 acre. Then I realized that's a long time; that's a big walk. A lot of it , a lot of the wall you have is incredibly natural. It's , you have the mountains. You have the rivers. You have some very powerful water areas. You have some areas that are virtually impossible to get by. So we didn't need walls everywhere, but where we needed them , because it's been so successful that we've added nearly 300 miles. And that's currently under construction. This was our original wish: to get these areas done where it was such trouble. And now we have it. It's either in construction or pre-construction , an additional 300 miles. In every region that we've built the wall, illegal crossings and drug smuggling have plummeted. Absolutely plummeted. In the Rio Grande Valley, crossings have dropped nearly 80 percent. In Yuma, Arizona, illegal entries have been slashed by 90 percent. Nationwide, ICE and Border Patrol have seized over 2 million pounds of fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other deadly narcotics, saving thousands and thousands of lives. We've arrested nearly 500,000 illegal aliens with criminal records , some with very serious criminal records of the type you don't want to know about, like murder. We removed nearly 20,000 gang members from the United States, including 4,500 members of MS-13 , probably the worst gang of them all. Through the landmark reforms we've put into place, we have ended the immigration chaos and reestablished American sovereignty.

I've been predicting it for a long time, and people didn't act on it. But I think big tech has made a terrible mistake, and very, very bad for our country. And that's leading others to do the same thing, and it causes a lot of problems and a lot of danger. Big mistake. They shouldn't be doing it. But there's always a counter move when they do that. I've never seen such anger as I see right now, and that's a terrible thing. Terrible thing. And you have to always avoid violence. And we have , we have tremendous support."}
{"SpeechID":"VSDT1912021325","POTUS":"Donald Trump","Date":"2021-01-19","SpeechTitle":"Remarks by President Trump In Farewell Address to the Nation","Type":"speech","RawText":"THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans: Four years ago, we launched a great national effort to rebuild our country, to renew its spirit, and to restore the allegiance of this government to its citizens. In short, we embarked on a mission to make America great again , for all Americans. As I conclude my term as the 45th President of the United States, I stand before you truly proud of what we have achieved together. We did what we came here to do , and so much more. This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck , a very important word. I'd like to begin by thanking just a few of the amazing people who made our remarkable journey possible. First, let me express my overwhelming gratitude for the love and support of our spectacular First Lady, Melania. Let me also share my deepest appreciation to my daughter Ivanka, my son-in-law Jared, and to Barron, Don, Eric, Tiffany, and Lara. You fill my world with light and with joy. I also want to thank Vice President Mike Pence, his wonderful wife Karen, and the entire Pence family. Thank you as well to my Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows; the dedicated members of the White House Staff and the Cabinet; and all the incredible people across our administration who poured out their heart and soul to fight for America. I also want to take a moment to thank a truly exceptional group of people: the United States Secret Service. My family and I will forever be in your debt. My profound gratitude as well to everyone in the White House Military Office, the teams of Marine One and Air Force One, every member of the Armed Forces, and state and local law enforcement all across our country. Most of all, I want to thank the American people. To serve as your President has been an honor beyond description. Thank you for this extraordinary privilege. And that's what it is , a great privilege and a great honor. We must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation. All Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated. Now more than ever, we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor, and forge our common destiny. Four years ago, I came to Washington as the only true outsider ever to win the presidency. I had not spent my career as a politician, but as a builder looking at open skylines and imagining infinite possibilities. I ran for President because I knew there were towering new summits for America just waiting to be scaled. I knew the potential for our nation was boundless as long as we put America first. So I left behind my former life and stepped into a very difficult arena, but an arena nevertheless, with all sorts of potential if properly done. America had given me so much, and I wanted to give something back. Together with millions of hardworking patriots across this land, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world. It was about \"America First\" because we all wanted to make America great again. We restored the principle that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Our agenda was not about right or left, it wasn't about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation. With the support and prayers of the American people, we achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before. We fixed our broken trade deals, withdrew from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership and the impossible Paris Climate Accord, renegotiated the one-sided South Korea deal, and we replaced NAFTA with the groundbreaking USMCA , that's Mexico and Canada , a deal that's worked out very, very well. Also, and very importantly, we imposed historic and monumental tariffs on China; made a great new deal with China. But before the ink was even dry, we and the whole world got hit with the China virus. Our trade relationship was rapidly changing, billions and billions of dollars were pouring into the U.S., but the virus forced us to go in a different direction. The whole world suffered, but America outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy that we built. Without the foundations and footings, it wouldn't have worked out this way. We wouldn't have some of the best numbers we've ever had. We also unlocked our energy resources and became the world's number-one producer of oil and natural gas by far. Powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited America's job creation and achieved record-low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women , almost everyone. Incomes soared, wages boomed, the American Dream was restored, and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle. The stock market set one record after another, with 148 stock market highs during this short period of time, and boosted the retirements and pensions of hardworking citizens all across our nation. 401(k)s are at a level they've never been at before. We've never seen numbers like we've seen, and that's before the pandemic and after the pandemic. We rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories, and brought back the beautiful phrase: \"Made in the USA.\" To make life better for working families, we doubled the child tax credit and signed the largest-ever expansion of funding for childcare and development. We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train more than 16 million American workers for the jobs of tomorrow. When our nation was hit with the terrible pandemic, we produced not one, but two vaccines with record-breaking speed, and more will quickly follow. They said it couldn't be done but we did it. They call it a \"medical miracle,\" and that's what they're calling it right now: a \"medical miracle.\" Another administration would have taken 3, 4, 5, maybe even up to 10 years to develop a vaccine. We did in nine months. We grieve for every life lost, and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for all. When the virus took its brutal toll on the world's economy, we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen. We passed nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saved or supported over 50 million jobs, and slashed the unemployment rate in half. These are numbers that our country has never seen before. We created choice and transparency in healthcare, stood up to big pharma in so many ways, but especially in our effort to get favored-nations clauses added, which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the world. We passed VA Choice, VA Accountability, Right to Try, and landmark criminal justice reform. We confirmed three new justices of the United States Supreme Court. We appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret our Constitution as written. For years, the American people pleaded with Washington to finally secure the nation's borders. I am pleased to say we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. We have given our brave border agents and heroic ICE officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before, and to enforce our laws and keep America safe. We proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place. This includes historic agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, along with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall. We restored American strength at home and American leadership abroad. The world respects us again. Please don't lose that respect. We reclaimed our sovereignty by standing up for America at the United Nations and withdrawing from the one-sided global deals that never served our interests. And NATO countries are now paying hundreds of billions of dollars more than when I arrived just a few years ago. It was very unfair. We were paying the cost for the world. Now the world is helping us. And perhaps most importantly of all, with nearly $3 trillion, we fully rebuilt the American military , all made in the USA. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in 75 years: the Space Force. And last spring, I stood at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and watched as American astronauts returned to space on American rockets for the first time in many, many years. We revitalized our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and ended the wretched life of its founder and leader, al Baghdadi. We stood up to the oppressive Iranian regime and killed the world's top terrorist, Iranian butcher Qasem Soleimani. We recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As a result of our bold diplomacy and principled realism, we achieved a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East. Nobody believed it could happen. The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony, not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of a new Middle East, and we are bringing our soldiers home. I am especially proud to be the first President in decades who has started no new wars. Above all, we have reasserted the sacred idea that, in America, the government answers to the people. Our guiding light, our North Star, our unwavering conviction has been that we are here to serve the noble everyday citizens of America. Our allegiance is not to the special interests, corporations, or global entities; it's to our children, our citizens, and to our nation itself. As President, my top priority, my constant concern, has always been the best interests of American workers and American families. I did not seek the easiest course; by far, it was actually the most difficult. I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism. I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because that's what you elected me to do. Your needs were my first and last unyielding focus. This, I hope, will be our greatest legacy: Together, we put the American people back in charge of our country. We restored self-government. We restored the idea that in America no one is forgotten, because everyone matters and everyone has a voice. We fought for the principle that every citizen is entitled to equal dignity, equal treatment, and equal rights because we are all made equal by God. Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, to have their voice heard, and to have their government listen. You are loyal to your country, and my administration was always loyal to you. We worked to build a country in which every citizen could find a great job and support their wonderful families. We fought for the communities where every American could be safe and schools where every child could learn. We promoted a culture where our laws would be upheld, our heroes honored, our history preserved, and law-abiding citizens are never taken for granted. Americans should take tremendous satisfaction in all that we have achieved together. It's incredible. Now, as I leave the White House, I have been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share. As the world's most powerful nation, America faces constant threats and challenges from abroad. But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness. A nation is only as strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people. No nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values, history, and heroes, for these are the very sources of our unity and our vitality. What has always allowed America to prevail and triumph over the great challenges of the past has been an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history. We must never lose this conviction. We must never forsake our belief in America. The key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity. That means focusing on what we have in common: the heritage that we all share. At the center of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression, free speech, and open debate. Only if we forget who we are, and how we got here, could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America. It's not even thinkable. Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions.In America, we don't insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes. We just don't do that. America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That's not who we are. It will never be who we are. For nearly 250 years, in the face of every challenge, Americans have always summoned our unmatched courage, confidence, and fierce independence. These are the miraculous traits that once led millions of everyday citizens to set out across a wild continent and carve out a new life in the great West. It was the same profound love of our God-given freedom that willed our soldiers into battle and our astronauts into space. As I think back on the past four years, one image rises in my mind above all others. Whenever I traveled all along the motorcade route, there were thousands and thousands of people. They came out with their families so that they could stand as we passed, and proudly wave our great American flag. It never failed to deeply move me. I knew that they did not just come out to show their support of me; they came out to show me their support and love for our country. This is a republic of proud citizens who are united by our common conviction that America is the greatest nation in all of history. We are, and must always be, a land of hope, of light, and of glory to all the world. This is the precious inheritance that we must safeguard at every single turn. For the past four years, I have worked to do just that. From a great hall of Muslim leaders in Riyadh to a great square of Polish people in Warsaw; from the floor of the Korean Assembly to the podium at the United Nations General Assembly; and from the Forbidden City in Beijing to the shadow of Mount Rushmore, I fought for you, I fought for your family, I fought for our country. Above all, I fought for America and all it stands for , and that is safe, strong, proud, and free. Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There's never been anything like it. The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle but instead only grow stronger by the day. As long as the American people hold in their hearts deep and devoted love of country, then there is nothing that this nation cannot achieve. Our communities will flourish. Our people will be prosperous. Our traditions will be cherished. Our faith will be strong. And our future will be brighter than ever before. I go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come. Thank you, and farewell. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.
