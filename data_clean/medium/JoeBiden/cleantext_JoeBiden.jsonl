My city of Wilmington, Delaware , like many other cities , was in flames.This was the context in which in felt called to public service. It is why I chose to leave one of the oldest law firms in Delaware to become a public defender, to defend those who could not afford to defend themselves. It is why I chose to run for the county council to combat redlining and discriminatory housing policies. It is why I eventually ran for the United States Senate at the age of 29.When I arrived in the Senate, the world I entered was a legislative body where segregationists held some of the most powerful positions and the Southern Manifesto was woven into the political landscape of America. I quickly came to realize that in order to truly serve your constituents and get things done, it is imperative to engage with those who may not see the world the same way as you do. Sometimes you may find their views to be downright repugnant.During my time in the Senate, I took those segregationists on many times and I won many times on legislation that mattered to me, such as repeatedly reauthorizing Voting Rights Act. I chose to work within the system to make the system better to get things done for the least among us. Faced with a choice between doing nothing and acting , I have chosen to act, and for that reason I\u2019ve witnessed and worked to make sure that the America in 2019 is a very different place than the America of the 1970s.In the midst of this presidential election, my experience has been weaponized to use against me, generating attacks on my statements and votes on busing in the 1970s.There are many who would prefer to dwell on the past, but I am running for President to be the candidate for a better future. A candidate who will give every child in America the education they deserve. I have always firmly believed that a child should not have to get on a bus to attend a good school because there should be first-rate quality schools in every neighborhood in this nation, especially in 2019 America. I am the candidate that will work to raise the minimum wage to a livable wage and ensure proper pay for public school teachers. Additionally I will initiate the largest infrastructure program in our nation\u2019s history and school construction and facilities will be a significant focus of that program. All these programs are intertwined and will work together to close the wealth gap by starting at the source , our children.I know that plenty of other attacks have , and will , come. So let\u2019s get some facts straight.I am not beholden to banks because I supported the bankruptcy bill. I believed I was taking a bad bill that was going to pass without my vote and making it better.With regards to trade; I don\u2019t believe there is a stronger voice for working people in this country than mine , and we better wake up and realize that either we will set the rules of the road in the future or China will , to our great detriment.Recent attacks on a woman\u2019s right to keep personal health decisions between her and her doctor are offensive to me. I will move to codify Roe vs. Wade if this Court strikes it down.I voted for the Iraq War , that didn\u2019t stop President Obama from turning to me to handle Iraq once we took office , giving me the responsibility to bring home 150,000 combat troops from Iraq , which I did.I don\u2019t believe there is anyone in this race more prepared to lead the world today than me. That may sound like bragging. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s simply what I believe.If you look at the issues I\u2019ve been attacked on, nearly every one of them is for something well before 2008. It\u2019s as if my opponents want you to believe I served until 2008 , and then took the next eight years off.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB1592019146","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2019-09-15","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden\u2019s Remarks at the 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing Memorial Service","RawText":"Occasionally in life, there are moments so stark they divide all that camebefore from everything after.They stop the clocks. They rip away the trivial from the essential. They force us to confront difficult truths about our institutions, about our society, about ourselves.10:22 am, September 15, 1963 was such a moment.Even at a time defined by racial hatred. Even in a city then described as the most \u201cthoroughly segregated\u201d in the United States.The assassination of four joyful and innocent young girls preparing for Sunday school. The indiscriminate cruelty of a stack of dynamite. The appalling impunity afforded to the murderers while a grieving community cried out for justice.It pierced us.Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, and Denise.Their murders laid bare the lie that any child could be free in America while oppression\u2019s long shadow darkened our cities and fear ruled our countryside.These children of God, they\u2019d be almost 70 now.Each was an individual life rich in promise, stolen. Each a future, unfulfilled.Sarah Collins Rudolph, Addie Mae\u2019s sister, survived the bombing, but she still carries the scars of the blast.For Sarah, and for so many of the family members here, this is not a symbolic loss that transfixed the world and inspired a nation.It\u2019s personal.And even 56 years later , it\u2019s tragic.When you lose a child so young the loss is always punctuated by questions.What would she have looked like?What might she have done?What memories will never be?The heart breaks anew whenever you remember what incredible potential and opportunity was denied.But we must never let ourselves forget.As Dr. King so rightly proclaimed at the funeral service: \u201cTheir death says to us that we must work passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the American dream.\u201dAnd indeed, a blast that took aim at the foundations of this community in 1963 blew wide the door for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.It shook my generation to its core and helped us realize it wasn\u2019t enough to work on the fringes of the movement.The struggle against hate, injustice, and institutional racis,must be the unrelenting work of our lives.It summoned us to battles many of us have been fighting for half a century , for voting rights, civil rights, equal justice, and equal opportunity.More than five decades after we lost those four innocent girls, we gather on this hallowed ground conceived and constructed by black dreams, raised up by black resilience, sanctified by black blood and tears.We must acknowledge that there can be no realization of the American dream without grappling with the original sin of slavery brought to these shores 400 years ago, and the centuries-long campaign of violence, fear, and trauma wrought upon Black people in this country.The domestic terrorism of white supremacy has been the antagonist of our highest ideals from before our founding.Lynch mobs, arsonists, bomb makers, and lone gunmen. And as we all now realize, this violence does not live in the past.The same poisonous ideology that lit the fuse at 16th Street pulled the trigger in Mother Emanuel, unleashed the anti-Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh and Poway, and saw a white supremacist gun down innocent Latino immigrants in an El Paso parking lot with military-grade weapons declaring it would stop a quote: \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas.\u201dWe have not relegated racism and white supremacy to the pages of history. But the greatness of this nation is that we still strive to.\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident ,We\u2019ve never lived up to it. But we\u2019ve never walked away from it.It\u2019s what unites us , the American creed.It\u2019s one of the most powerful ideas in the history of the world, and it lives in each and every one of us.Our belief in it is what compels us to act.We remember the hope of scripture , \u201chate evil, and love good, and establish justice in the gate.\u201dAnd the Lord may be gracious to us.It\u2019s in the wake of these before and after moments , when the choice between evil and good is starkest, when the pain pierces the heart the deepest, when what\u2019s at stake matters the most, that we decide who we are, and maybe more importantly, who we want to be.That\u2019s when as people , and as a nation , we are defined.In my life, when Dr. King was assassinated, and my city of Wilmington burned, I faced a defining moment.To stay at a big law firm or leave and become a public defender.I left and took the first steps in a life committed to civil rights.Before and after, my life would never be the same.When my first wife and daughter were killed and my two boys were badly injured in a car accident, I faced a defining moment.To walk away from public life or stay and serve.I chose to serve. Before and after.My life would never be the same.When my son Beau died, he made me promise to stay engaged, don\u2019t retreat.And even though I know there is a hole in my heart that will never heal, I\u2019ve kept my promise. I\u2019ve stayed engaged.A defining moment. Before and after. It\u2019s never the same.Charlottesville. When I saw the torches, when I heard the chants, when I saw hate on the march, I knew it was a defining moment.For me. For this nation.Silence would be complicity.Before and after Charlottesville. This nation will never be the same.The Psalms tell us: \u201cWeeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning\u201d.The philosopher tells us: \u201cFaith sees best in the dark.\u201dNow hate is on the rise and we are at a defining moment.Who are we? Who do we want to be?After Charlottesville, I said that I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation.And I say it again today.We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.And here at the historic 16th Street Baptist church, there\u2019s no more powerful reminder of what\u2019s at stake.And no more poignant example of what is demanded of us in response.It\u2019s a battle we have fought again and again. It\u2019s a battle that has claimed countless lives.Hate only hides, it doesn\u2019t go away. If you give it oxygen it comes out from under the rocks. It can be defeated or drowned out , but never vanquished.But we also should realize that revulsion to hate at its ugliest can summon the very best in us.The coddling of white supremacists so heinous it cannot be ignored by any decent American presents an opportunity to continue to make progress against systemic prejudice.I believe the American people are ready, just as they were with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.I am sure, in those first hours after the bomb exploded, it was hard to see through the smoke and rubble to a day like today.As Dr. King eulogized those girls, perhaps not even he could have imagined the day, nearly 50 years later, when this nation\u2019s first black president would award them the Congressional Gold Medal, one of our highest civilian honors.It is only with persistent effort.It is only with fortitude in our actions.It is only with faith in ourselves and the future that may yet be.That change comes , sometimes slowly, sometimes all at once , and progress continues.My good friend Senator Doug Jones is here today. He never gave up on justice for Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, and Denise.It didn\u2019t matter that almost 40 years had passed , doing the right thing doesn\u2019t tarnish with time.We know we\u2019re not there yet , the work is not done.And it\u2019s hard, heart-wringing work.But we are almost 330 million Americans. And I know there is nothing we cannot accomplish if we stand together.Stand against hate. Stand up for what , at our best , our nation believes.Honesty. Decency.Treating everyone with dignity and respect.Giving everyone a fair shot. Leaving no one behind.Giving hate no safe harbor.Demonizing no one , not the poor, the powerless, the immigrant, the other.Standing as a beacon to the world.Being part of something bigger than ourselves.That\u2019s who we are.And that\u2019s why I believe so passionately that we have got to work to bring this country together again.That is the work demanded for rebirth and renewal.56 years ago, the Sunday school lesson was \u201cA Love that Forgives.\u201d Reverend Cross never got to give his sermon that day.But it\u2019s a lesson that\u2019s subsequently been delivered by Reverend Price, and will be again today.We must choose forgiveness. Again and again. And that takes incredible strength.I will never forget traveling with President Obama to meet with the grieving families of Mother Emanuel in Charleston, South Carolina after Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a friend, was murdered along with eight of his parishioners.I had only just lost my own son, Beau. But I wanted to be there with them.And I watched in awe as President Obama addressed the community, as he sang with them, Amazing Grace.As he offered the healing and solidarity and leadership and that our nation so desperately needed.I witnessed that amazing grace again when I stayed on with Jill to attend the Sunday service at Mother Emanuel.As I sat through that service, it buoyed my own family in the loss we had suffered.And I was astounded by the amazing grace of those parishioners, the families of the victims, when they chose to forgive the killer.To bind up the sharp wounds and the wrongs done to them with compassion.To meet hatred with peace.To be able to live again in community after such a horrifying rupture.Their example is a moral challenge to each of us in our own lives.So my prayer for all of us this morning is that in this moment, when our nation must once again decide who we are and what we stand for, we will remember the strength of this community.We\u2019ll remember the moment time stopped. And then we\u2019ll remember everything that came after.And we will choose once more to fight for our shared American dream.Mr. Mayor, Reverend Price, and to all the \u201cBeloved Community,\u201d thank you for allowing me to be part of this important commemoration.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/joe-bidens-remarks-at-the-16th-street-church-bombing-church-memorial-service-9541875a2d96?source=user_profile---------152----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Occasionally in life, there are moments so stark they divide all that camebefore from everything after.They stop the clocks. They rip away the trivial from the essential. They force us to confront difficult truths about our institutions, about our society, about ourselves.10:22 am, September 15, 1963 was such a moment.Even at a time defined by racial hatred. Even in a city then described as the most 'thoroughly segregated' in the United States.The assassination of four joyful and innocent young girls preparing for Sunday school. The indiscriminate cruelty of a stack of dynamite. The appalling impunity afforded to the murderers while a grieving community cried out for justice.It pierced us.Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, and Denise.Their murders laid bare the lie that any child could be free in America while oppression's long shadow darkened our cities and fear ruled our countryside.These children of God, they'd be almost 70 now.Each was an individual life rich in promise, stolen. Each a future, unfulfilled.Sarah Collins Rudolph, Addie Mae's sister, survived the bombing, but she still carries the scars of the blast.For Sarah, and for so many of the family members here, this is not a symbolic loss that transfixed the world and inspired a nation.It's personal.And even 56 years later , it's tragic.When you lose a child so young the loss is always punctuated by questions.What would she have looked like?What might she have done?What memories will never be?The heart breaks anew whenever you remember what incredible potential and opportunity was denied.But we must never let ourselves forget.As Dr. King so rightly proclaimed at the funeral service: 'Their death says to us that we must work passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the American dream.'And indeed, a blast that took aim at the foundations of this community in 1963 blew wide the door for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.It shook my generation to its core and helped us realize it wasn't enough to work on the fringes of the movement.The struggle against hate, injustice, and institutional racis,must be the unrelenting work of our lives.It summoned us to battles many of us have been fighting for half a century , for voting rights, civil rights, equal justice, and equal opportunity.More than five decades after we lost those four innocent girls, we gather on this hallowed ground conceived and constructed by black dreams, raised up by black resilience, sanctified by black blood and tears.We must acknowledge that there can be no realization of the American dream without grappling with the original sin of slavery brought to these shores 400 years ago, and the centuries-long campaign of violence, fear, and trauma wrought upon Black people in this country.The domestic terrorism of white supremacy has been the antagonist of our highest ideals from before our founding.Lynch mobs, arsonists, bomb makers, and lone gunmen. And as we all now realize, this violence does not live in the past.The same poisonous ideology that lit the fuse at 16th Street pulled the trigger in Mother Emanuel, unleashed the anti-Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh and Poway, and saw a white supremacist gun down innocent Latino immigrants in an El Paso parking lot with military-grade weapons declaring it would stop a quote: 'Hispanic invasion of Texas.'We have not relegated racism and white supremacy to the pages of history. But the greatness of this nation is that we still strive to.'We hold these truths to be self-evident ,We've never lived up to it. But we've never walked away from it.It's what unites us , the American creed.It's one of the most powerful ideas in the history of the world, and it lives in each and every one of us.Our belief in it is what compels us to act.We remember the hope of scripture , 'hate evil, and love good, and establish justice in the gate.'And the Lord may be gracious to us.It's in the wake of these before and after moments , when the choice between evil and good is starkest, when the pain pierces the heart the deepest, when what's at stake matters the most, that we decide who we are, and maybe more importantly, who we want to be.That's when as people , and as a nation , we are defined.In my life, when Dr. King was assassinated, and my city of Wilmington burned, I faced a defining moment.To stay at a big law firm or leave and become a public defender.I left and took the first steps in a life committed to civil rights.Before and after, my life would never be the same.When my first wife and daughter were killed and my two boys were badly injured in a car accident, I faced a defining moment.To walk away from public life or stay and serve.I chose to serve. Before and after.My life would never be the same.When my son Beau died, he made me promise to stay engaged, don't retreat.And even though I know there is a hole in my heart that will never heal, I've kept my promise. I've stayed engaged.A defining moment. Before and after. It's never the same.Charlottesville. When I saw the torches, when I heard the chants, when I saw hate on the march, I knew it was a defining moment.For me. For this nation.Silence would be complicity.Before and after Charlottesville. This nation will never be the same.The Psalms tell us: 'Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning'.The philosopher tells us: 'Faith sees best in the dark.'Now hate is on the rise and we are at a defining moment.Who are we? Who do we want to be?After Charlottesville, I said that I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation.And I say it again today.We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.And here at the historic 16th Street Baptist church, there's no more powerful reminder of what's at stake.And no more poignant example of what is demanded of us in response.It's a battle we have fought again and again. It's a battle that has claimed countless lives.Hate only hides, it doesn't go away. If you give it oxygen it comes out from under the rocks. It can be defeated or drowned out , but never vanquished.But we also should realize that revulsion to hate at its ugliest can summon the very best in us.The coddling of white supremacists so heinous it cannot be ignored by any decent American presents an opportunity to continue to make progress against systemic prejudice.I believe the American people are ready, just as they were with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.I am sure, in those first hours after the bomb exploded, it was hard to see through the smoke and rubble to a day like today.As Dr. King eulogized those girls, perhaps not even he could have imagined the day, nearly 50 years later, when this nation's first black president would award them the Congressional Gold Medal, one of our highest civilian honors.It is only with persistent effort.It is only with fortitude in our actions.It is only with faith in ourselves and the future that may yet be.That change comes , sometimes slowly, sometimes all at once , and progress continues.My good friend Senator Doug Jones is here today.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB3102019145","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2019-10-03","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden\u2019s Remarks in Reno, Nevada","RawText":"Last week the House of Representatives opened an inquiry into whether the President of the United States has committed impeachable offenses. Its investigation will focus on evidence that Donald Trump attempted to extort a foreign government , the Government of Ukraine , to manufacture charges against me, to go after my family, and to undermine my candidacy for President. That he corrupted and weaponized key agencies of government to include the National Security Council, the Justice Department, the State Department, and the Office of the Vice President to do his personal political bidding. That he betrayed the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States in service of his re-election. For years, Trump has dismissed and excused Russian aggression in Ukraine, including the illegal annexation of Crimea. And, for years, Trump has made no secret of his desire to welcome Vladimir Putin back into the fold at Ukraine\u2019s expense. Trump and his emissaries have sought, repeatedly, to extort the existential fears of Ukraine\u2019s leaders for political advantage. Now we know that he may have held up political support and vitally needed aid appropriated by Congress to pressure Ukraine to give-in to his political demands. And he personally told the leader of Ukraine that American foreign policy wasn\u2019t going to run through the State Department , it was going to run through his personal, private lawyer who was demanding non-existent dirt on me. And the State Department , instead of carrying out our nation\u2019s foreign policy , was enlisted to do his bidding. People around the president knew that what he was doing was wrong , profoundly wrong. So they tried to cover it up by hiding the evidence. Now because of the courageous actions of a whistleblower, Trump\u2019s scheme has been exposed. He did it because like every bully in history, he\u2019s afraid. He\u2019s afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November. And now that all this has come out, Trump\u2019s predictable response has been to attack me and my family. Desperate and defensive, Trump sends one crazed tweet after another insinuating that the whistleblower should be executed, threatening to prosecute the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, warning direly of civil war. He is repeatedly smearing me and my family. His party fans out to carry the smear, are blanketing the airwaves , paid for by the special interests so well served by his presidency. Let me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me: I\u2019m not going anywhere. You\u2019re not going to destroy me. And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get. Trump knows there is no truth in his charges and attacks against me. None. Zero. Every independent news organization that has reviewed his charges at length found them to be a flat out lie. Every single one of them. What I did in Ukraine was to carry out the official policy of the United States government to root out corruption in Ukraine in conjunction with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, our closest democratic allies, and courageous reformers I met on the ground. This was a fully transparent policy carried out in front of the whole world. And fully embraced by the international community of democracies. We weren\u2019t pressing Ukraine to get rid of a tough prosecutor. We were pressing them to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn\u2019t do his job with someone who, at the time, we hoped would finally crack down on corruption. Trump on the other hand was secretly putting at risk our national security to pursue a personal political vendetta against me because he does not want to run against me. And what is truly stunning about this are the exhortations involved in holding back desperately needed military assistance and political support from our Ukrainian friends while they are engaged in a live war with the Russians , a war that has cost thousands of Ukrainian lives. This isn\u2019t a game. This is deadly serious. But as we all know all too well, the truth doesn\u2019t matter to Donald Trump. It never has. And it never will. Which is why I do not think the American people are going to believe him. The American people know me , and they know him. And I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against his long record of lying and cheating and stealing any day of the week. The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone\u2019s integrity is a joke. But it\u2019s important to step back from the heated 24-hour news cycle and focus carefully on the larger story. It\u2019s not about Donald Trump\u2019s antics. It\u2019s about what has brought Donald Trump and the nation to this sobering moment in our history , and to the choice facing us in 2020. What has brought us here is simply this: the abuse of power. The abuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency. The American presidency is an office of immense power. That\u2019s why character matters more in a president than any other office in our government. That\u2019s why one of the gravest threats to our democracy is a president who puts their own personal gain ahead of the public good. And that is why Trump will do anything it takes to hold on to it. We need to be clear about something. The threat posed by this president isn\u2019t just to our constitution. This isn\u2019t just an academic exercise in political theory. A president who puts his own self-interest ahead of the public good and national security also poses a threat to each and every American in our daily lives. This was on full display just a few days after the House opened its impeachment inquiry , when we saw a wounded president meeting with the head of the NRA in the Oval Office. Do you think they were talking about the safety of the American people? Or do you think they were talking about how much money the NRA was going to spend to keep Trump in office? What do you think mattered more to Trump? His reelection? Or the safety of our children? Or do you think they talked about Trump protecting the NRA and the NRA protecting Donald Trump? You want an example of what happens when a president puts his own selfish interests ahead of the national interest , when a president abuses his power? I\u2019d say that\u2019s Exhibit A. You want another example? Climate change. It\u2019s not possible for Trump to do any more for the fossil fuel industry. He\u2019s turned his back on the science. He\u2019s pulled America out of the Paris Agreement. He\u2019s repealed the new fuel economy standards that we put in place in our administration. And in return? The money is pouring in. We\u2019re facing an existential crisis. The UN tells us we have roughly ten years to deal with this problem. And he is single handedly standing in the way. And what about health care? Trump has relentlessly , cynically , attacked Obamacare. He has no replacement. He just wants it gone. It doesn\u2019t matter how many people are hurt. It doesn\u2019t matter that it will put at risk the preexisting condition protections that are in place for more than 100 million Americans. It doesn\u2019t matter that women will once again be charged more just because of their gender. It\u2019s an Obama achievement , so it has to go. And, if in the process he can pocket big money for his from the insurance companies, all the better. Or how about his wall? You know the one Mexico was going to pay for. His big promise from 2016. Going nowhere. Instead of comprehensive immigration reform, we have political grandstanding about a wall that , no, Mexico will not pay for , and yes, cruel and unusual policies that separate families and seek to keep kids in cages indefinitely without basic necessities like soap or toothbrushes continues. Donald Trump acts, reacts, twists and turns according to what he thinks is good for him, for his ego, his personal politics, his campaign money. And virtually every day he launches a barrage of tweets to attack, to disparage, to insult, to threaten anyone who does not bathe him in praise. He\u2019s even gone so far as to threaten the whistleblower. Now fearful about his reelection, he is becoming more unhinged. Trump wants a campaign on his terms. He imagines he can pick his opponent and face only the candidates he thinks he can beat. We are not going to let Donald Trump pick the Democratic nominee for President. That\u2019s why he picked up the phone, called the leader of Ukraine, and pressured him to manufacture a case to smear the opponent he least wants to face. Here\u2019s what Trump and the special interests paying for his campaign know. They know I\u2019ve taken them on in the past and beat them. And they know I will again. They know I\u2019m not just promising change. They know I\u2019ll deliver it. I\u2019ve taken on the NRA , twice , and beat them both times. We made the Brady bill the law. We banned assault weapons. We limited magazine clips. And we can do it again. We took on the health insurance industry when we passed Obamacare. And I\u2019ll take them on again. My plan is to build on Obamacare with a public option. The health insurance companies hate it. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve already attacked my plan. They don\u2019t want the competition that will come from a public option, and drug companies don\u2019t want their profits cut. And here\u2019s what they really fear: they know I can get it done. Not in five years. Not in ten years. Now. Our administration made the largest ever investment in clean energy with the Recovery Act and assembled an international coalition to combat climate change. Trump has abdicated American leadership on climate. I will reassert it. I\u2019m not surprised Donald Trump asked a foreign government for help to beat me. I\u2019m not surprised the head of the NRA met with Trump to prop him up. I\u2019m not surprised Trump\u2019s special interest friends are spending millions to attack me. And I\u2019m not surprised this President\u2019s allegations of wrongdoing against me have been debunked across the board. I\u2019m not going to let him get away with this. I\u2019m not backing down. And I\u2019m not going to be distracted by all his lies, smears, distortions, and name calling. I\u2019m going to let Congress do its job on impeachment. And I\u2019m going to stay focused on your lives. What we can\u2019t lose sight of in this election is that this election is about you. Your kids. Your family. And you can\u2019t wait when it comes to health care or jobs or education or guns or climate. The world can\u2019t wait for America to once again lead a stable peaceful international order. I have said it before and I\u2019ll say it again. Like JFK when he spoke about taking America to the moon, I refuse to postpone the work that has to get done. For you. That takes vision , and yes it takes plans , but that\u2019s not enough. It takes the proven ability to get things done. There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing big, consequential legislation than me. From the ban on assault weapons to the Violence Against Women Act to Obamacare. I\u2019ve been there. I know what it takes to get it done. Let me finish with this: a lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump. And I agree. We do have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/joe-bidens-remarks-in-reno-nevada-d6df0d9f0ac4?source=user_profile---------151----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Last week the House of Representatives opened an inquiry into whether the President of the United States has committed impeachable offenses.

That's why he picked up the phone, called the leader of Ukraine, and pressured him to manufacture a case to smear the opponent he least wants to face. Here's what Trump and the special interests paying for his campaign know. They know I've taken them on in the past and beat them. And they know I will again. They know I'm not just promising change. They know I'll deliver it. I've taken on the NRA , twice , and beat them both times. We made the Brady bill the law. We banned assault weapons. We limited magazine clips. And we can do it again. We took on the health insurance industry when we passed Obamacare. And I'll take them on again. My plan is to build on Obamacare with a public option. The health insurance companies hate it. That's why they've already attacked my plan. They don't want the competition that will come from a public option, and drug companies don't want their profits cut. And here's what they really fear: they know I can get it done. Not in five years. Not in ten years. Now. Our administration made the largest ever investment in clean energy with the Recovery Act and assembled an international coalition to combat climate change. Trump has abdicated American leadership on climate. I will reassert it. I'm not surprised Donald Trump asked a foreign government for help to beat me. I'm not surprised the head of the NRA met with Trump to prop him up. I'm not surprised Trump's special interest friends are spending millions to attack me. And I'm not surprised this President's allegations of wrongdoing against me have been debunked across the board. I'm not going to let him get away with this. I'm not backing down. And I'm not going to be distracted by all his lies, smears, distortions, and name calling. I'm going to let Congress do its job on impeachment. And I'm going to stay focused on your lives. What we can't lose sight of in this election is that this election is about you. Your kids. Your family. And you can't wait when it comes to health care or jobs or education or guns or climate. The world can't wait for America to once again lead a stable peaceful international order. I have said it before and I'll say it again. Like JFK when he spoke about taking America to the moon, I refuse to postpone the work that has to get done. For you. That takes vision , and yes it takes plans , but that's not enough. It takes the proven ability to get things done. There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing big, consequential legislation than me. From the ban on assault weapons to the Violence Against Women Act to Obamacare. I've been there. I know what it takes to get it done. Let me finish with this: a lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump. And I agree. We do have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum."}

{"SpeechID":"MEJB10102019144","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2019-10-10","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden\u2019s Remarks in Rochester, New Hampshire","RawText":"Good afternoon everyone. It\u2019s great to be back in New Hampshire. This is a state built on fierce pride , pride in your independence, pride in your reputation, pride in your character. That has been true from the earliest days of our nation, when \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d wasn\u2019t a motto. It was an imperative for survival sprung from a granite-hard determination that no one would decide the future of the American people , save ourselves. And when those freedom fighters earned our independence and cobbled together a nation capable of self-governance of meeting threats, both foreign and domestic, they knew that the battle for our nation didn\u2019t end at Yorktown. At the time, one of the biggest concerns was that foreign nations would interfere in our affairs. That is why we have the Emoluments clause to prevent presidents from being secretly bribed or paid off by foreign governments. In his farewell address, George Washington specifically warned against foreign nations meddling in our affairs: \u201cSince history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.\u201d Over the 200 plus years that have followed, we have been constant in our vigilance to keep foreign nations out of our elections. That is , until Donald Trump. Last week, on the White House lawn, President Trump invited China to help decide our elections. He did it while standing in front of a line of reporters and cameras, in the broad light of day. It was the third foreign power that we know of , that he has asked in clear, unmistakable language , to intervene on his behalf in the democratic proceedings of the United States. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening \u201d \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though \u201d to Ukraine\u2019s president. \u201cChina should start an investigation.\u201d It\u2019s wrong. It undermines our elections. And it\u2019s un-American. Go into any city or town in this nation. Go into any schoolhouse. Go into any town hall. Go into any VFW hall. Go to any football or baseball game and ask a simple question: Is it ok for a foreign nation to meddle in our elections? To spread lies about an opponent. Particularly at the direct invitation of the sitting President. The answer is no. As Americans, it offends every bone in our body. The ballot box is sacred ground in America. It\u2019s where we make our voice heard. It\u2019s where we decide who leads us. It\u2019s where we chart America\u2019s future. It\u2019s where we fulfill our duty as citizens. It\u2019s not complicated. It\u2019s called democracy. We believe Americans should decide American elections. Period. But Trump will do anything to get re-elected, including violating the most basic forms of democracy. That is stunning , and dangerous, outrageous , because it directly threatens our democracy. That\u2019s not hyperbole. That\u2019s a fact. No President in American history ever dared engage in such unimaginable behavior. With his words and with his actions, President Trump has indicted himself. By obstructing justice and refusing to comply with the congressional inquiry, he has already convicted himself. In full view of the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation, and committed impeachable acts. To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, and our basic integrity, he should be impeached. And that is not only because of what he has done. The answer to whether he has committed acts sufficient to warrant impeachment is obvious. We see it in Trump\u2019s own words. We see it in the texts from the State Department officials that have been made public. We see it in his pulling much of the United States government into his corrupt scheme. But we must remember that impeachment isn\u2019t only about what a president has done. It is also about the threat a president poses to the nation if allowed to remain in office. One thing about this president is absolutely clear , he sees no limit on his power. He believes the entire United States government can be corrupted into furthering his personal political needs. He is even willing to hold Congressionally-appropriated aid to foreign nations hostage to his personal political demands. He believes if he does something, it\u2019s legal. And perhaps most importantly, he believes there is nothing we can do about it. He believes he can and will get away with anything he does. We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it. It\u2019s no joke. He is shooting holes in our Constitution. We cannot let him get away with it. We should have no illusion. This is a president who has decided that this nation doesn\u2019t have the tools or the power or the political will to stop him from doing whatever he wants. Trump isn\u2019t just testing us. He is laughing at us. He has no sense of decency. He doesn\u2019t care about the law. He believes that people , and nations , that follow the rules are suckers, fools, losers. We have to prove him wrong. We have to demonstrate that our constitution, our government, and our elected leaders are up to this moment. And this is an especially dangerous moment for our nation because we know the pressure on Trump is only going to increase. And as that pressure increases, he is only going to grow more volatile, more erratic, more self-serving, more destructive. He will stop at nothing to save himself , no individual, no institution, nothing that we have held sacred in this nation for more than 200 years will be safe. If Donald Trump was still just a reality TV star, it wouldn\u2019t matter. But he\u2019s responsible for the largest economy in the world. He\u2019s the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military in history. He\u2019s supposed to be the leader of the free world. Yet, with the free world under threat from advancing authoritarianism, Donald Trump has completely abdicated American global leadership. At a time when China\u2019s abuses of human rights are cause for enormous concern; more than one million Uyghur Muslims imprisoned in horrific so-called \u201creeducation\u201d camps; in Hong Kong, protestors increasingly being met with violent repression as they demand the democratic rights they were promised , does he speak out for human rights and stand with the people of Hong Kong? No. In fact, he promises to stay silent. Trump and his emissaries have sought , repeatedly , to extort the existential fears , of Ukraine\u2019s leaders for political advantage. Holding up political support and vitally needed military aid to pressure Ukraine at a time when it is engaged in a live war with Russia , a war that has cost thousands of Ukrainian lives. This isn\u2019t a game. This is deadly serious. The United States cannot afford to have a president who will abuse whatever power is available to him to get re-elected. And here\u2019s the kicker: people around the president knew that what he was doing was wrong , profoundly wrong. So they tried to cover it up by hiding the evidence. We only know about all this thanks to the courageous actions of a whistleblower who has since been joined by others stepping up to protect our country. Trump\u2019s scheme has been exposed. Trump did it because like every bully in history, he\u2019s afraid. He\u2019s afraid of just how badly I will beat him next November. He is targeting me and my family with lies and distortions and smears and that is all that they are because he thinks it will undermine my campaign for the presidency. He just keeps lying even though the mainstream media has called him out for his lies. He\u2019s spending tens of millions of special interest dollars to spread those lies. He\u2019s trying to orchestrate a campaign where truth and the facts are irrelevant. His lying is matched only by his manifest incompetence. There is no level to which he will not stoop. He\u2019s insinuated that the people who spoke to the whistleblower should be executed. Here\u2019s what Trump said in a closed door meeting to US diplomats: \u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d What President has ever used such language? Now the Whistleblower is worried for their safety. Thanks to our president. Trump\u2019s even dared to say that if he is removed from office, it will spark a civil war. Right wing media outlets are full of baseless conspiracy theories. The darkest reaches of the internet are awash in these vile attacks. And he is spending millions on TV to spread his lies. And that is what they are , lies. There is no truth in his charges and attacks against me. None. Zero. Every independent news organization that has reviewed his charges at length found them to be a flat out lie. And Trump knows it. My insistence that a prosecutor who was viewed as corrupt be replaced was the official policy of the United States government, supported by Republican Senators, the European Union, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and our allies , including the UK, France, and Germany. What Trump did in Ukraine was to carry out a secret policy for his own personal political benefit. What I did was to seek to replace a weak prosecutor , with one who would, we hoped, go after the corruption that is holding back Ukraine. What Trump did was hold hostage political support and hundreds of millions in desperately needed aid to a country at war to advance his personal political demands. And now there are reports that not only did Trump send Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, to carry out his scheme and co-opt the State Department , and, as alleged, allies of Giuliani were also working a side deal at the same time to make millions in Ukraine. A corrupt scheme with an additional helping of corruption and self-dealing on the side: Classic Trump. The abuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency. He acts, reacts, twists, and turns according to what he thinks is good for him, for his ego, his personal politics, his campaign money. And virtually every day he launches a barrage of tweets to disparage, to insult, to threaten anyone who does not bathe him in praise, who challenges his outrageous behavior , behavior that is beneath a President. Think about the way he tweets and talks about women of color who dare to speak their minds against him , sitting Members of Congress. Think about the way he turned on the FBI and America\u2019s intelligence services , who pointed out Russia and Putin\u2019s attacks on our electoral process. He has repeatedly demonstrated his desire to advance his own personal gain ahead of the public good. And that he will do anything it takes to hold on to power , to protect himself. We need to be clear about something. This isn\u2019t just an academic exercise in political theory. A president who puts his own self-interest ahead of the public good and national security also poses a threat to each and every American in our daily lives. He\u2019s already threatened the Whistleblower , and anyone who talked to the Whistleblower. Now we hear reports of additional Whistleblowers coming forward. Some with information on how he was pressuring Ukraine. Others with respect to pressure he may have put on the IRS about his taxes. And by the way , where are his taxes? What is he hiding? What is he afraid of? What is buried in those returns? Why can\u2019t the American people see them? Why can\u2019t he release them? I\u2019ve released 21 years of my tax returns. Every penny I\u2019ve made is there for the public to see. And Trump? It\u2019s all hidden. Why? Why? He has proven he will use the Justice Department against anyone he believes threatens his power or ability to stay in office. And now the Justice Department is intervening on Trump\u2019s behalf in his personal lawsuits to hide his finances from the public eye. Trump has proven he will use the State Department against anyone he believes threatens his power or ability to stay in office. He will order the removal of career diplomats who won\u2019t carry out his whims without question. Does anyone doubt he would use any other part of the government, any other power available to a president, to destroy anyone he believes threatens his power or ability to stay in office. When I announced my candidacy, I said I was running to restore the soul of this nation. That is what is at stake in 2020. That\u2019s why this election is so important. And that\u2019s why we are not going to let Donald Trump pick the Democratic nominee for President. I\u2019m not going to let him get away with this. He\u2019s picked a fight with the wrong guy. And I\u2019m not going to be distracted by all his lies, smears, distortions, and name calling. None of these attacks are true. I\u2019m going to stay focused on your lives. That\u2019s what this election is about , you. Your children. Your family. And you can\u2019t wait when it comes to health care, or jobs, or education, or guns, or climate. The world can\u2019t wait for America to once again lead a stable peaceful international order. I have said it before and I\u2019ll say it again. Like JFK said, when he spoke about taking America to the moon: \u201cI am unwilling to postpone the work that has to get done. For you. For America. The possibilities are limitless.\u201d That takes vision , and yes it takes plans. But that\u2019s not enough. It takes the proven ability to get it done. There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I have. From the Voting Rights Act renewal, to the ban on assault weapons, to the Violence Against Women Act, to Obamacare, to the Recovery Act that kept us from sliding into a Depression, I\u2019ve been there. I know what it takes to get it done. Let me finish with this , a lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump. And I agree. We do have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum. May God Bless America and May God Protect our Troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/joe-bidens-remarks-in-rochester-new-hampshire-3860b4156da6?source=user_profile---------150----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Good afternoon everyone.

And that's why we are not going to let Donald Trump pick the Democratic nominee for President. I'm not going to let him get away with this. He's picked a fight with the wrong guy. And I'm not going to be distracted by all his lies, smears, distortions, and name calling. None of these attacks are true. I'm going to stay focused on your lives. That's what this election is about , you. Your children. Your family. And you can't wait when it comes to health care, or jobs, or education, or guns, or climate. The world can't wait for America to once again lead a stable peaceful international order. I have said it before and I'll say it again. Like JFK said, when he spoke about taking America to the moon: 'I am unwilling to postpone the work that has to get done. For you. For America. The possibilities are limitless.' That takes vision , and yes it takes plans. But that's not enough. It takes the proven ability to get it done. There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I have. From the Voting Rights Act renewal, to the ban on assault weapons, to the Violence Against Women Act, to Obamacare, to the Recovery Act that kept us from sliding into a Depression, I've been there. I know what it takes to get it done. Let me finish with this , a lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump. And I agree. We do have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum. May God Bless America and May God Protect our Troops."}
{"SpeechID":"MEJB17102019142","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2019-10-17","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden\u2019s Remarks in Davenport, Iowa","RawText":"Of all the roles a president of the United States must fill, none is more consequential than Commander-in-Chief. The power to deploy the might of the most powerful military in the history of the world is not an ego booster or a ratings booster. To take the oath of office is to swear a solemn responsibility to our troops and their families , that their government will not risk their lives pointlessly.To our allies and partners , that we will stand with them in time of need.And to our adversaries , that the United States seeks peace, but will not hesitate to defend our vital national security interests.By this measure , like so many others , Donald Trump is a complete failure. He is the most reckless and incompetent Commander-in-Chief we\u2019ve ever had. He has failed, repeatedly, to foresee the obvious consequences of his impulses. And when the utterly predictable occurs , he seems not to care. Or he blames someone else. The buck never stops with him. Talks with North Korea collapsing because they were based on nothing but a delusional promise from a bloody dictator.An erratic trade war with China that\u2019s caused huge pain , including here in Iowa, where 160 workers in the Quad Cities were recently laid off, indefinitely, at Deere.Real pain for American farmers and manufacturers for virtually no gain, because he has no strategy. Iran growing more provocative and restarting its nuclear program because Trump chose to renege on a diplomatic agreement that was working. And now, Turkish forces invading Syria to attack our Kurdish partners because Trump tweeted our withdrawal. The events of this past week in Syria have brought devastating clarity to just how dangerous he is to our national security, to our leadership around the world, and to the lives of our brave men and women serving in uniform. To building and maintaining the confidence of our allies.By precipitously withdrawing the small number of U.S. forces in Syria, Trump managed in one fell swoop to betray our Kurdish partners who helped defeat ISIS.Create a humanitarian crisis with innocent civilians and ethnic and religious minority communities in the crossfire, and up to 160,000 newly displaced people fleeing their homes.Force our troops into retreat, under fire, as forces from Turkey, Russia, and the Assad regime flow in.Give ISIS a new lease on life by forcing the Kurds to defend themselves against Turkey instead of fighting ISIS remnants and guarding prisons with 10,000 ISIS terrorists and supporters, some of whom have now escaped.And throw global confidence in American leadership into a free fall. These consequences can be laid directly at Donald Trump\u2019s feet. He greenlighted Turkey\u2019s invasion. Now he\u2019s left asking Turkey to stop it. But the damage has been done. You don\u2019t get do-overs when it comes to national security. These decisions are deadly serious. Yes, the dynamics in Syria are incredibly complicated. And yes, the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds dates back decades. But before Trump\u2019s tweet, the small number of U.S. forces, working together with our Kurdish partners, were actually keeping northern Syria relatively stable while keeping the pressure on what was left of ISIS. Now that\u2019s been blown apart. Imagine how demoralizing this must be for our troops: Russian mercenaries taking victory laps inside the bases that President Trump ordered them to abandon. Turkey attacking the very people they fought alongside. That\u2019s why we need someone in the Oval Office who understands the gravity and the consequences of their decisions. Trump\u2019s \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom\u201d has undone years of hard-won progress across two administrations in a matter of days , including in our fight against ISIS in Syria.And as retired Admiral James Stavridis said, \u201ceveryone was absolutely flabbergasted.\u201dEven Republicans in Congress know this is irresponsible. It\u2019s about the only time they\u2019ve mustered the backbone to publicly criticize Trump. That\u2019s how outrageous it is , even Mitch McConnell knows it\u2019s wrong. Trump tried to justify his decision to abandon our Kurdish partners by making the ridiculous charge that they: \u201cdidn\u2019t help us in the Second World War, they didn\u2019t help us with Normandy.\u201d Well, guess what: they helped us smash ISIS, a direct threat to the United States and our friends around the world. Now, that didn\u2019t happen during World War II, but some of it did happen during Trump\u2019s first year in office. You\u2019d think he\u2019d remember. He bragged about it at the time. The Kurds stood with us to accomplish a vital national security objective of the United States , the destruction of ISIS\u2019s territorial caliphate. We achieved this without sending tens of thousands of U.S. forces and without spending a quarter of a trillion dollars, as we did during the Iraq surge.Instead, the Obama-Biden administration worked with and alongside partners in Syria with just a few hundred Americans supporting tens of thousands of local fighters to take the fight to ISIS on the ground. Our strategy was so successful, it turned out that Trump\u2019s secret plan to defeat ISIS was to just keep doing what we were doing , until last week. These brave Kurdish and Arab forces paid a steep price, with over 10,000 making the ultimate sacrifice. And then, Trump sold them out. All it took was one phone call with the President of Turkey. So now, instead of being a reliable American partner helping maintain stability and keeping a lid on terrorism , the Kurds have taken the only option available to them to avoid being wiped out by the onslaught of the Turkish military. They\u2019ve made a deal with twin devils , with Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin , to hand control of the northeast of Syria back to the brutal, Russian- and Iranian-backed regime. How does this keep America safe? How does this advance our interests in the world? The answer is simple. It doesn\u2019t. You know who does benefit, though , America\u2019s adversaries.Russia, which will be now be able to further expand its influence throughout Syria.Russia again, which gets to sit back and watch one NATO ally impose sanctions on another, furthering Putin\u2019s ultimate goal of fracturing our Alliance. Iran and Hezbollah, which will now be more emboldened to use Syrian territory to launch attacks against Israel.ISIS, which is already seeking to regroup, and now has hundreds of supporters released back into the region.And every single strongman, autocrat, and dictator around the world who has just learned that President Trump will abandon our partners under the smallest amount of pressure.All we\u2019re left with is a Donald Trump-shaped hole in America\u2019s credibility , and more chaos, more instability, more threats to the American people, our partners, and our allies in the region.And don\u2019t be fooled by Trump\u2019s argument that he\u2019s pulling U.S. troops out of the Middle East and ending forever wars. He may have caved to Erdogan and Putin, forcing our troops to retreat under fire, but he\u2019s also authorized the deployment of thousands of additional troops to the Gulf and Saudi Arabia to deal with a yet another crisis that he helped create , the one with Iran.But this time, without our allies. So don\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s con. This is not American leadership , this is bending to the will of strongmen. And this is not an end to forever wars , it is a recipe for more wars. He still has more than a year in office , God forbid he has four more after that. Imagine what damage he could do in that time , either intentionally or through sheer incompetence. We cannot let that happen. I will not let that happen.The next president will face an enormous challenge of picking up the pieces of America\u2019s foreign policy, salvaging our reputation, and rebuilding confidence in the commitments made by the United States around the world. They will have to address the world as it is in January 2021 , in whatever state of disarray Trump leaves it.And there won\u2019t be time to lose building relationships from scratch. We need a leader who can, on day one, pick up the phone to call our NATO allies and there won\u2019t be any question of whether or not the United States will meet our treaty obligations or stand up for democracy and freedom. I\u2019ve personally met and built relationships with almost every world leader. I\u2019ve negotiated with President Erdogan. I know how he operates. In fact, the reason that the United States partnered with Kurdish militias in Syria in the first place is because Turkey dragged its heels on helping us fight ISIS. I spent hours , literally , going over proposals with Erdogan. He wanted to leverage our concern over ISIS to get the United States to essentially go to war against the Syrian government , which neither our Administration, nor the American people wanted. So, unlike President Trump , I told Erdogan \u201cno.\u201d But we kept working with Turkey, helping them cope with millions of Syrian refugees , designated as much humanitarian aid as we could to alleviate as much suffering as possible, while also welcoming those fleeing violence to our shores. And we put in place the successful strategy with the Kurds that ultimately brought down ISIS, while preventing Turkey and the Kurds from coming to blows. We shouldn\u2019t fool ourselves , there may never be a solution in Syria that satisfies our best hope for a region at peace with itself. No one wants American troops to be forever embroiled in conflict in the Middle East or \u201cnation-building.\u201dBut there\u2019s a big difference between sending tens of thousands of American combat troops to the Middle East indefinitely , which I oppose and will end , and using small numbers of special operators to support local forces doing the fighting to advance our common security. We can be strong and smart at the same time. And when we do draw down, there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. And what Trump has done in Syria is disastrously wrong. So as this Trump-created crisis devolves further into chaos , what should we be doing? First, we should be working closely with NATO and the UN to bring more responsible parties to the table. The United States and Turkey are allies , even if Turkey is not acting like one , so we should be inviting in a broader coalition of countries to pressure Turkey to pull back from its operation, refrain from ethnic cleansing or targeting religious minorities, and cease its callous disregard for civilians. The international community should make it clear that we intend to investigate any reports of war crimes or violations of international humanitarian law, and to hold accountable those who are responsible. Second, we should actively work to mediate a resolution between Turkey and the Kurds to end the violence.The United States should be willing to set up and facilitate those talks and engage all sides. Leading the free world requires us to show up. To put skin in the game. We shouldn\u2019t be delegating this to Putin. Third, we have an obligation to provide critical humanitarian support to mitigate the new refugee crisis unfolding before our eyes. The Trump administration has released $50 million in humanitarian aid to Syria , but that\u2019s only a quarter of the $200 million in aid to Syria it suspended last year.And how will it be distributed when frontline humanitarian groups have suspended services and pulled their staff out of areas where there\u2019s fighting? We should be willing to carry out airlifts of food, water, and critical first aid supplies to meet the need. Fourth, we must remain laser-focused on preventing the resurgence of ISIS. As the Kurds withdraw to defend their villages from Turkish attack, it is easy to imagine ISIS re-growing and filling the void. We cannot let that happen.Because no matter how much Donald Trump tweets that it will be easy for the Europeans to recapture escaped ISIS fighters, or for us to \u201cgo back & BLAST\u201d ISIS , that\u2019s not how it works. That\u2019s not how it worked the first time, and it certainly won\u2019t be how it works if we have to fight ISIS again. During our Administration , we built a global coalition to take on ISIS that eventually grew to 81 partners. Nations and organizations from all around the world stood with us, because the word of the United States was trusted under the Obama-Biden administration. So ask yourself , after everything that Trump has done, after every international treaty that Trump has pulled out of, after every Ally that Trump has attacked, after leaving a partner to be slaughtered with no discernable strategy who would stand with us today? And if they don\u2019t stand with us, how many more of our brave sons and daughters will have to carry the fight alone in the future? And that brings me to the final point I want to make today. What President Trump is doing is bigger than Syria. It\u2019s more insidious than the betrayal of our brave Kurdish partners. It\u2019s more dangerous than taking our boot off ISIS\u2019s neck. Donald Trump is demolishing the moral authority of the United States. His incompetence is so extreme and his abuse of power is so rampant , that he is torching America\u2019s influence and our ability to get things done. Climate change, mass migrations, unfair trade practices, disruptive technologies, nuclear proliferation, an ascendant China and a resurgent Russia , how will we meet any of the real global challenges we face, if the United States is forever reduced in the eyes of the world to an unreliable partner? Diplomacy isn\u2019t just a series of handshakes and photo ops. It\u2019s relationships that you are constantly building and maintaining. Working to identify the areas of common interest while managing points of conflict. It requires discipline. It requires a team of experienced professionals that you empower , not diminish and demoralize. And it requires a coherent national security process to get everyone on the same page and to execute. After almost three years as president, Trump still doesn\u2019t understand any of this. And he never will. Because the only thing Donald Trump cares about is himself. Not our allies. Not our obligations. Not our diplomats. Not our values. Not our leadership. Not our standing in the world. Not the incredible human suffering caused by his decisions. Not even the likelihood that ISIS will regenerate and once more gain strength to threaten our country. There\u2019s so much at stake in this election , issues that matter to every single American family , and one of them is this: What does America stand for in the world? Who do we want to be? The United States builds alliances and works with our partner democracies , for the sake of our own national security and economic prosperity. No country, even one as powerful as ours, can go it alone against challenges that respect no borders and cannot be contained by walls. The investments we make in others come back to us ten-fold , in markets for our products, partners to help us tackle global challenges, and allies to deter aggression or fight alongside us when deterrence fails. If we\u2019re out of the picture, make no mistake , nations will make accommodations to work with those who are, whether that\u2019s Russia or China or any other country. And the world will move on without us. Donald Trump\u2019s vision is antithetical to everything generations of Americans have fought and sacrificed to defend. I believe we are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are. I believe we can and must still be the nation to which the world looks. That mobilizes others for the common good. The beacon of liberty, offering refuge to the oppressed. The bulwark of democracy and self-determination. The champion of human rights. The leader of the free world. All of that is on the ballot. So we have to choose. We have to choose the America we want to be. We have to choose if we want to retake our place in the world, to keep the United States safe and secure. We have to choose a president who will rebuild our credibility and restore the value of America\u2019s word. Thank you, and may God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/joe-bidens-remarks-in-davenport-iowa-80fbc8405c2c?source=user_profile---------148----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Of all the roles a president of the United States must fill, none is more consequential than Commander-in-Chief.

And it\u2019s an important reminder of the skill and commitment of our military, intelligence, and national security professionals. They are beyond compare.I\u2019m glad President Trump ordered the mission. But as more details of the raid emerge, it\u2019s clear that this victory was not due to Donald Trump\u2019s leadership. It happened despite his ineptitude as Commander-in-Chief.It\u2019s been reported that Trump\u2019s reckless decision to withdraw our troops from northern Syria forced the planning for the mission to be accelerated and the timeline compressed. His erratic behavior made it harder and more dangerous for the special forces carrying it out. And they had to fly through territory that is now hostile to the U.S., taking fire along the way , including territory we controlled just weeks ago.Trump has also made it less likely we will be able to successfully replicate a mission like this in the future.

DREAMers are Americans in every way that matters. We are better than this.What President Trump will never understand is that DACA not only gave hundreds of thousands of young people a chance at a better, more secure life, but that those DREAMers also gave back to our communities and our country ten-fold.

DREAMers are Americans in every way that matters. We are better than this.What President Trump will never understand is that DACA not only gave hundreds of thousands of young people a chance at a better, more secure life, but that those DREAMers also gave back to our communities and our country ten-fold.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB25112019134","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2019-11-25","SpeechTitle":"Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women","RawText":"The scourge of violence against women and girls affects every community around the world: an estimated one in three women are subjected to physical violence, rape or stalking by a partner at some point in their lives, with closer to 70% of women affected in some countries. Violence against women takes many forms, including sexual violence and rape, early and forced marriage, damaging practices like female genital mutilation and cutting, and street harassment. Violence against women tears families apart, stymies economic growth and development, and obstructs post-conflict reconciliation.Yet on this critical issue, like so many others, President Trump has abandoned American global leadership and reduced America\u2019s moral authority in the world by actively working against progress. He threatened to veto a UN Security Council resolution aimed at curbing sexual violence in conflict if it promised survivors access to the critical services they need to heal and recover. He has suspended funding to the UN Population Fund, which does important work to prevent gender-based violence globally. And his administration has attempted to rewrite the rules for asylum seekers, turning its back on women and children refugees fleeing gender-based violence. It\u2019s disgraceful, and it\u2019s beneath us as a nation.Today marks the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. Women\u2019s rights activists selected this date to honor the Mirabal sisters, three political activists killed on November 25, 1960, for standing up to a murderous regime in the Dominican Republic. Nearly 60 years later, women around the world from the frontlines of protest movements in Lebanon and Sudan to political chambers across Europe and the United States who raise their voices and call for change continue to face harassment and violence. Some, like Kurdish politician Hevrin Khalaf, who was brutally murdered in northern Syria last month, continue to pay the ultimate price for their activism. These attacks are intended to silence them and to intimidate other women , it\u2019s on all of us to ensure violence is not the cost of women gaining power and rights.Today, I join leaders and activists around the world to say violence against women must end. I have made this issue a priority throughout my career. As a Senator, I wrote and championed the Violence Against Women Act, landmark legislation that helped change the culture around domestic violence in the United States by making sure it would be treated as a crime, not a private matter, and by dedicating resources to support survivors. The Violence Against Women Act has had significant effect: between its implementation in 1994 and 2011, rates of serious victimization by an intimate partner dropped by 72 percent.This legacy has given the United States greater credibility to address gender-based violence on the international stage. In 2007, I introduced the International Violence Against Women Act (IVAWA), which provided a comprehensive approach to addressing gender-based violence globally. When Congress failed to act, the Obama-Biden administration used executive action to implement the core principles of the bill.But there is still more work to do at home and abroad, which is why, earlier this month, I issued the Biden Plan to End Violence Against Women. As president, I will expand the services available to all survivors , including those in marginalized communities who are disproportionately affected , and ensure justice is within their reach. My Administration will confront the online harassment and abuse that now is a too-frequent reality for women and young people around the world. We will address the deadly combination of gun violence and domestic violence in the United States. We will also do more to protect and empower immigrant women who are survivors of domestic violence and abuse, and to welcome women who come to the United States fleeing abuse, whose home governments cannot or will not protect them.Around the world, we must all stand up and speak out against gender-based violence. As president, I will restore U.S. leadership in foreign affairs, including by returning to a government-wide focus on uplifting the rights of women and girls. I will champion the fundamental human right of all women and girls to live free from violence , a future made more possible in the United States through the Violence Against Women Act. I am committed to building on the Obama-Biden legacy with new, comprehensive policies to address gender-based violence, including by supporting multilateral efforts to address sexual violence in conflict and holding perpetrators accountable. And I will immediately reverse the devastating global gag rule, which has hurt the health and wellbeing of countless women around the world.Today, as we honor the legacy of the Mirabal sisters and rally around the cause of ending violence against women and girls, it is important to recognize the many women around the world working to make their communities safer for everyone. As president, I will elevate these women\u2019s voices and ensure that the United States supports them, in the hopes that we will one day we will succeed in changing the culture and ending violence against women.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-international-day-for-the-elimination-of-violence-18c124f589c1?source=user_profile---------140----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"The scourge of violence against women and girls affects every community around the world: an estimated one in three women are subjected to physical violence, rape or stalking by a partner at some point in their lives, with closer to 70% of women affected in some countries.

According to UNAIDS, approximately 24.5 million people are on lifesaving antiretroviral therapy. Yet, with about 1.7 million new infections in 2018 alone, and HIV continuing to ravage certain marginalized populations, particularly women and young girls across sub-Saharan Africa, our work is far from over.To start, we must end the spread of HIV\/AIDS in the United States. This includes robust support for programs in communities with inadequate health services; fighting health disparities and inequalities in communities of color; expanding effective prevention programs; sufficiently funding the opioid epidemic response; and modernizing criminal laws that fuel stigma and create disproportionate penalties for people living with HIV.This is also a global crisis. In 2008, as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I led the re-authorization of the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). At that time, achieving the kind of progress we have seen was almost unimaginable. PEPFAR is one of the most impactful initiatives the United States has ever created, a shining example of American foreign assistance at its very best. The program has allowed more than 2.6 million babies with HIV-infected mothers to be born free of the disease. Together with the work of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and community partnerships in this fight, more than 32 million lives have been saved from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Every life saved is a victory, and with scientific progress and new advances in the treatment, prevention, and management of HIV\/AIDS, it is within our reach to eventually rid the planet of this epidemic. Evidence shows that medications that suppress the virus to undetectable levels can prevent transmission of HIV, and that expanded prevention programs can dramatically reduce new infections. Despite making a commitment to end HIV\/AIDS in the next decade, President Trump has proposed draconian cuts to domestic and international programs and undermined the Affordable Care Act, which are critical to achieving our goals. Furthermore, his efforts to allow health care providers to discriminate and deny services to LGBTQ patients may jeopardize prevention efforts in high-burden and high-risk communities, including transgender populations, who are five times as likely to be diagnosed with HIV.We need to support evidence-based policies to fight discrimination, support women\u2019s reproductive rights, ensure universal education for girls and boys, and defend the human rights of LGBTQ people around the world, which are all critical to finishing the work we started.Going forward, we must strategically integrate our HIV\/AIDS programs into a broader health and development agenda; work with countries to strengthen their health care systems to manage HIV and other health challenges; and expand our global health security efforts to rally other nations to join us in ending tuberculosis, malaria, and other epidemics. These increased investments in global health are in America\u2019s direct interest not only because they reduce the likelihood that deadly diseases spread unchecked, they strengthen global economic security.Over the last 30 years, the fight against HIV has taught us to be big-hearted; to follow the science; to treat everyone with dignity and respect; and to protect the human rights of all who walk this planet. With the compassion of people around the world and the dedication of communities on the front lines of this response, our shared dream of an AIDS-free future can become a reality.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-world-aids-day-5a718a5ab22c?source=user_profile---------139----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Today, Jill and I join communities around the world in marking World AIDS Day , a time to remember the millions of souls lost to this scourge and rededicate ourselves to realizing a future free of HIV\/AIDS.Ending HIV\/AIDS will take all of us working together, 'community by community.'

But as long as Trump sits in the Oval Office, we cannot make the progress our planet needs.It's time to put an end to President Trump's shameful abdication of leadership. The future of our country and the world our children and grandchildren inherit hangs in the balance."}

It\u2019s the same hatred that unleashed the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in U.S. history last year at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. That led a gunman armed with an AR-15 style gun to storm the Chabad of Poway Synagogue in California earlier this year on the last day of Passover.We have to fight the pernicious and persistent evil of anti-Semitism at every level of our society , starting with our political leaders. My dear friend, the late Tom Lantos, had a saying that I\u2019ve quoted frequently. He said, \u201cThe veneer of civilization is paper thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest.\u201d That means we have to stand up and speak out every time anti-Semitism rears its head, because silence can all too quickly become complicity.Yet, after Charlottesville, instead of condemning a naked display of hatred, Trump assigned a moral equivalence between those streaming through the night with torches, chanting anti-Semitic bile , and the courageous neighbors and activists who stood against them. He gave license and safe harbor to white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, and the KKK.We have all seen what has followed. There\u2019s a short line from those white supremacists in Charlottesville chanting \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d to the shooter at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last year, saying Jews \u201cwere committing genocide to his people.\u201dSince he took office, Trump has presided over a historic increase in hate crimes and biased-incidents targeting people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ Americans, and people of Jewish faith. Active hate groups grew to 1,020 in the U.S. last year, with white nationalists leaping almost 50%, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. FBI data shows that most of our religion-based hate crimes are aimed at Jews. At the end of 2017, Trump\u2019s first year in office, anti-Semitic incidents increased nearly 60%, the largest one-year increase since the Anti-Defamation League started keeping records 40 years ago.As I said after Charlottesville, we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.

He tried to ban a whole religion from entering our country. He has repeated anti-Semitic tropes and sought to turn U.S. support for Israel into a political football. In both clear language and cynical code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy and anti-Semitism in this nation. The Jewish people know better than anyone, that any action designed to marginalize one ethnic or religious group imperils us all.Trump\u2019s actions have only worsened the crisis: retweeting white nationalist postings.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB712020126","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-01-07","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden\u2019s Remarks on the Unfolding Situation with Iran","RawText":"Six months ago, here in New York City, I made the case that Donald Trump was \u201cdangerously incompetent and incapable of world leadership.\u201d In the past few days, in the wake of the killing of Iranian General Soleimani, Donald Trump has proven it beyond dispute. The haphazard decision-making process that led up to it, the failure to consult our allies or Congress, and the reckless disregard for the consequences that would surely follow , was dangerously incompetent.In the wake of such an enormous escalation that has exploded geo-politics in the region and put the United States and Iran on a collision course, what would we expect of an American President , and what have we heard from President Trump? We have not heard a sober-minded explanation to reassure the American people about his decision and its consequences. Not level-headed words meant to dial down tensions and take us off the path of conflict.No press conference or consultation with Congress. No , all we have heard from this president is tweets. Threats. Tantrums. And all we have heard from his administration are shifting explanations, evasive answers, and repeated assertions of an imminent threat, without the necessary evidence to support that conclusion. And since this is a president with a history of lying about everything , who has destroyed his own credibility, and that of the United States on the global stage , neither the American people, nor our allies, are inclined to take his word for it. If there was an imminent threat that required extraordinary action, then we are owed that explanation , and the facts to back it up. These are matters of deadly import, so let me be unmistakably clear: Donald Trump does not have the authority to go to war with Iran without Congressional authorization. Working with Congress is not an optional part of the job. Presidential notification to Congress about the need to exercise war powers cannot be satisfied in 280 characters or less. And no president should ever take the United States to war without securing the informed consent of the American people. So , because he refuses to level with the American people about the danger in which he has placed American troops and our diplomatic personnel and civilians, as well as our partners and allies, or to demonstrate even a modicum of presidential gravitas , I will. That starts with an honest accounting of how we got here. Make no mistake: this outcome of strategic setbacks, heightened threats, chants of \u201cdeath to America\u201d once more echoing across the Middle East, Iran and its allies vowing revenge. This was avoidable.The seeds of these dangers were planted by Donald Trump himself on May 8, 2018 , the day he tore up the Iran nuclear deal, against the advice of his own top national security advisors. The day he turned his back on our closest European allies, and decided it was more important to him to destroy any progress made by the Obama-Biden Administration than build on it to create a better, safer world. When we had the Iran Deal, we had verifiably cut off every one of Iran\u2019s pathways to a nuclear weapon. International inspectors repeatedly confirmed Iran\u2019s compliance, as did our intelligence agencies. One of the greatest threats to stability in the region and global security was off the table. And when the Iran Deal was in force, we did not have this dangerous cycle of tit-for-tat provocation and response. There was a united front of allies and partners to address Iran\u2019s other destabilizing actions throughout the region. The Iran Deal was not only accomplishing the critical mission it was designed for, it created an environment where diplomacy was possible. But Trump walked away , not Iran. Trump made the United States the international outlier. Trump re-imposed significant sanctions designed to exert \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on the regime, with claims that it would deter Iranian aggression and return Iran to the negotiating table to secure a much-promised \u201cbetter deal.\u201d And on both fronts, as many anticipated at the time, Trump\u2019s promises were empty, baseless, and na\u00efve. And since then, all that has materialized is an utterly predictable cycle of escalating conflict with Iran. Of course Iran would seek to demonstrate that the pressure we were exerting was not cost free , that it could take actions to make life more difficult for us, as well. So Iran began again to enrich uranium beyond the limits allowed under the Iran deal. Iran attacked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran shot down an unmanned U.S. surveillance drone.Yet the administration had no plan to prevent, mitigate, or appropriately respond to these provocations. Instead, Trump acted erratically and impulsively. He ordered a retaliatory strike, then called it off at the last minute , feeding Iran\u2019s sense of impunity.Then, the administration imposed more sanctions, shot down an Iranian drone, issued a warrant to seize an Iranian oil tanker.Before long, Iran attacked Saudi oil facilities and Iranian-backed militia in Iraq restarted rocket attacks against our bases. Until one of those attacks, against our base in Kirkuk, killed a U.S. citizen and wounded others. It was a tragic loss of life, and an act condemned by all Americans.In response, Trump bombed five sites in Iraq and Syria tied to the militia group, killing at least 25. Iraqi protestors, organized by Iranian-backed militia, assaulted our Embassy in Baghdad and breached the outer wall. No injuries were reported, but Trump was embarrassed by the images of a burnt-out reception area. He ordered a drone strike to kill Soleimani , perhaps the second most important official in Iran , near the Baghdad airport. And rushed thousands more troops to the region to deal with the fallout.Action and reaction. Provocation and response. All predictable , and, indeed, all predicted. A president who says he wants to end endless war in the Middle East is bringing us dangerously close to starting a new one. A president who says he wants out of the region sends more than 18,000 additional troops to deal with a crisis of his own making. And an administration that claims its actions have made Americans safer in the same breath urges our citizens to leave Iraq and puts Americans throughout the region on notice because of the increased danger. I have no illusions about Iran. The regime has long sponsored terrorism and threatened our interests. It continues to detain American citizens. They\u2019ve ruthlessly killed hundreds of protesters, and they should be held accountable for their actions. But there is a smart way to counter them , and a self-defeating way. Trump\u2019s approach is demonstrably the latter. Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops and thousands of innocent lives throughout the region. He was the mastermind, but he was not the whole of the regime or its capacity to strike back. So the question is: was the reward of removing a bad actor worth the risk of what comes next?We don\u2019t have any evidence to suggest that Trump or anyone around him thought seriously about that calculus. It\u2019s been reported that the Pentagon , which has long warned against taking a shot like this , was shocked that Trump would take such a risk. This is not just a question of whether Iran will retaliate , it almost certainly will , but what it will mean for our troops and our personnel throughout the region. What it will mean for our allies and partners who also have troops in harm\u2019s way that are impacted by this decision. What it will mean for our long-term mission to counter Iran and prevent ISIS from bouncing back, and our ability to pursue our broader strategic aims in the region. Already, we are seeing the fall out. Iran has declared it will no longer abide by any of the constraints set up under the nuclear deal , putting it back on track to obtaining material for a nuclear weapon, and pushing the region closer to a nuclear crisis. Our forces in Iraq and Syria are now focused on protecting themselves and preparing to leave , putting the counter-ISIS mission on hold, and allowing a deadly terrorist organization the room to regroup and reactivate. The Iraqi parliament has voted to eject all American and coalition forces from the country. And however you may feel about an American military presence in the Middle East, there is a right way and a wrong way to draw down our troop presence. Getting unceremoniously kicked out is unequivocally the wrong way. And if we do end up having to leave, that would be another boon to Iran , tipping the balance of power in the region. Where, just weeks ago, there were spontaneous protests across Iran against the regime, the killing of Soleimani has taken that pressure off the regime. Trump\u2019s impulsive decision may well do more to strengthen Iran\u2019s position in the region, than any of Soleimani\u2019s plots could have ever accomplished. Whether or not we see more loss of life, more threats against American interests and assets , this is already a debacle. And at what is possibly the most dangerous time in recent American history , at precisely the moment when we should be rallying our allies to stand beside us and hold the line against threats , Donald Trump\u2019s short-sighted \u201cAmerica First\u201d dogmatism has come home to roost. Our closest allies are calling for restraint and de-escalation , on both sides. Making a moral equivalence between us and Iran. Russia and China are quietly reveling in the prospect that the United States may once more be bogged down in another major conflict in the Middle East. They would love nothing more than to be able to pursue their own interests, and carve out their own spheres of influence, without the United States challenging them on human rights, on abusive trade practices, or on meddling in other nations\u2019 democracies , because we are too busy fighting Iran. We are alone. And we alone will have to bear the costs of Donald Trump\u2019s folly. This is also the moment when we most feel the lack of a functioning national security process or any investment in diplomacy.After three years of hollowing out the State Department; disrespecting and dismissing our intelligence community; destroying the relationship between the White House and Capitol Hill; throwing out the deliberate policy making process that has served Republican and Democratic administrations for decades; corroding the value of the word of the United States; abusing our allies; embracing dictators; creating, not solving, foreign policy crises on the international stage , we are in a much worse position to meet the demands of this crisis than we were when President Obama and I left office. President Trump has no strategy here. No endgame. And here\u2019s the hardest truth of all: His constant mistakes and poor decision making have left us with a severely limited slate of options for how to move forward , and most of the options are bad. But there are some key steps that any responsible commander in chief would take. And, while I don\u2019t expect Donald Trump will listen to me, I hope he listens to those around him who understand the gravity of the threats we now face. He should take all necessary steps to protect our forces and ensure the security of our diplomats, civilians, and overseas facilities , not just in the Middle East, but anywhere that Iran might strike back. He should ensure that federal authorities are working with states, local governments, and private institutions to guard against the heightened risk of cyber attacks. He should stop tweeting so he doesn\u2019t box us in with his threats, such that the only options left to us or Iran are increasingly damaging strikes and counterstrikes. And he should immediately reach out to our European partners and others to send private signals of deterrence and de-escalation to Iran and find a way to avoid the onrush of war. The best way to do that, of course, would be for President Trump, to rejoin the Iran Deal and build on it , if Iran also moves back into compliance with its obligations , and re-establish international consensus about how to confront the threats from Iran. The only way out of this crisis is through diplomacy , clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that\u2019s not about one-off decisions or one-upsmanship. Diplomacy that is designed to de-escalate the crisis, protect our people, and secure our regional interests , including our counter-ISIS campaign. No one wants war. But it\u2019s going to take hard work to make sure we don\u2019t end up there by accident. Finally, and this one\u2019s not optional, Mr. President, you have to explain your decisions and your strategy to the American people. That is your job as President , Not Dear Leader, not Supreme Leader. Democracy runs on accountability. And nowhere is that more important than in the power to make war and bring peace. You are required to work with Congress. You are required to abide by the War Powers Resolution. You cannot pursue a war with Iran absent Congressional authority. The existing AUMFs , the Congressional Authorizations for the Use of Military Force , do not apply. The American people do not want, and our Constitution will not abide, a president who rules by fiat and demands obedience. I served in the executive branch of our government for eight years, but I served in the legislative branch for 36 prior to that, and I understand better than anyone that the system will not hold unless we find ways to work together to advance our national interests , not the political interests of one person or one party. We need to restore the balance of powers between the branches of government. We need checks and balances that actually serve to check and balance the worst impulses of our leaders , in any branch. We need to use our system to bring us together as a nation , not abuse it to rip us apart. That\u2019s not a na\u00efve or outdated way of thinking. That\u2019s the genius and timelessness of our democratic system, which has, for more than 240 years, allowed us to remake ourselves, reckon with our shortcomings, and move ever forward. That\u2019s what we owe to those brave men and women who step forward to wear the uniform of these United States; who dedicate their lives to diplomatic service; who choose to join the Peace Corps or to work in development; who represent the best of our country all around the world , and who are, today, doing so at greater risk because of the actions of our president.

The haphazard decision-making process that led up to it, the failure to consult our allies or Congress, and the reckless disregard for the consequences that would surely follow , was dangerously incompetent.In the wake of such an enormous escalation that has exploded geo-politics in the region and put the United States and Iran on a collision course, what would we expect of an American President , and what have we heard from President Trump? We have not heard a sober-minded explanation to reassure the American people about his decision and its consequences. Not level-headed words meant to dial down tensions and take us off the path of conflict.No press conference or consultation with Congress. No , all we have heard from this president is tweets. Threats. Tantrums. And all we have heard from his administration are shifting explanations, evasive answers, and repeated assertions of an imminent threat, without the necessary evidence to support that conclusion. And since this is a president with a history of lying about everything , who has destroyed his own credibility, and that of the United States on the global stage , neither the American people, nor our allies, are inclined to take his word for it. If there was an imminent threat that required extraordinary action, then we are owed that explanation , and the facts to back it up. These are matters of deadly import, so let me be unmistakably clear: Donald Trump does not have the authority to go to war with Iran without Congressional authorization. Working with Congress is not an optional part of the job. Presidential notification to Congress about the need to exercise war powers cannot be satisfied in 280 characters or less. And no president should ever take the United States to war without securing the informed consent of the American people. So , because he refuses to level with the American people about the danger in which he has placed American troops and our diplomatic personnel and civilians, as well as our partners and allies, or to demonstrate even a modicum of presidential gravitas , I will. That starts with an honest accounting of how we got here. Make no mistake: this outcome of strategic setbacks, heightened threats, chants of 'death to America' once more echoing across the Middle East, Iran and its allies vowing revenge. This was avoidable.The seeds of these dangers were planted by Donald Trump himself on May 8, 2018 , the day he tore up the Iran nuclear deal, against the advice of his own top national security advisors. The day he turned his back on our closest European allies, and decided it was more important to him to destroy any progress made by the Obama-Biden Administration than build on it to create a better, safer world. When we had the Iran Deal, we had verifiably cut off every one of Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon. International inspectors repeatedly confirmed Iran's compliance, as did our intelligence agencies. One of the greatest threats to stability in the region and global security was off the table. And when the Iran Deal was in force, we did not have this dangerous cycle of tit-for-tat provocation and response. There was a united front of allies and partners to address Iran's other destabilizing actions throughout the region. The Iran Deal was not only accomplishing the critical mission it was designed for, it created an environment where diplomacy was possible. But Trump walked away , not Iran. Trump made the United States the international outlier. Trump re-imposed significant sanctions designed to exert 'maximum pressure' on the regime, with claims that it would deter Iranian aggression and return Iran to the negotiating table to secure a much-promised 'better deal.' And on both fronts, as many anticipated at the time, Trump's promises were empty, baseless, and na\ufffdve. And since then, all that has materialized is an utterly predictable cycle of escalating conflict with Iran. Of course Iran would seek to demonstrate that the pressure we were exerting was not cost free , that it could take actions to make life more difficult for us, as well. So Iran began again to enrich uranium beyond the limits allowed under the Iran deal. Iran attacked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran shot down an unmanned U.S. surveillance drone.Yet the administration had no plan to prevent, mitigate, or appropriately respond to these provocations. Instead, Trump acted erratically and impulsively. He ordered a retaliatory strike, then called it off at the last minute , feeding Iran's sense of impunity.Then, the administration imposed more sanctions, shot down an Iranian drone, issued a warrant to seize an Iranian oil tanker.Before long, Iran attacked Saudi oil facilities and Iranian-backed militia in Iraq restarted rocket attacks against our bases. Until one of those attacks, against our base in Kirkuk, killed a U.S. citizen and wounded others. It was a tragic loss of life, and an act condemned by all Americans.In response, Trump bombed five sites in Iraq and Syria tied to the militia group, killing at least 25. Iraqi protestors, organized by Iranian-backed militia, assaulted our Embassy in Baghdad and breached the outer wall. No injuries were reported, but Trump was embarrassed by the images of a burnt-out reception area. He ordered a drone strike to kill Soleimani , perhaps the second most important official in Iran , near the Baghdad airport. And rushed thousands more troops to the region to deal with the fallout.Action and reaction. Provocation and response. All predictable , and, indeed, all predicted. A president who says he wants to end endless war in the Middle East is bringing us dangerously close to starting a new one. A president who says he wants out of the region sends more than 18,000 additional troops to deal with a crisis of his own making. And an administration that claims its actions have made Americans safer in the same breath urges our citizens to leave Iraq and puts Americans throughout the region on notice because of the increased danger. I have no illusions about Iran. The regime has long sponsored terrorism and threatened our interests. It continues to detain American citizens. They've ruthlessly killed hundreds of protesters, and they should be held accountable for their actions. But there is a smart way to counter them , and a self-defeating way. Trump's approach is demonstrably the latter. Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops and thousands of innocent lives throughout the region. He was the mastermind, but he was not the whole of the regime or its capacity to strike back. So the question is: was the reward of removing a bad actor worth the risk of what comes next?We don't have any evidence to suggest that Trump or anyone around him thought seriously about that calculus. It's been reported that the Pentagon , which has long warned against taking a shot like this , was shocked that Trump would take such a risk. This is not just a question of whether Iran will retaliate , it almost certainly will , but what it will mean for our troops and our personnel throughout the region. What it will mean for our allies and partners who also have troops in harm's way that are impacted by this decision. What it will mean for our long-term mission to counter Iran and prevent ISIS from bouncing back, and our ability to pursue our broader strategic aims in the region. Already, we are seeing the fall out. Iran has declared it will no longer abide by any of the constraints set up under the nuclear deal , putting it back on track to obtaining material for a nuclear weapon, and pushing the region closer to a nuclear crisis. Our forces in Iraq and Syria are now focused on protecting themselves and preparing to leave , putting the counter-ISIS mission on hold, and allowing a deadly terrorist organization the room to regroup and reactivate. The Iraqi parliament has voted to eject all American and coalition forces from the country. And however you may feel about an American military presence in the Middle East, there is a right way and a wrong way to draw down our troop presence. Getting unceremoniously kicked out is unequivocally the wrong way. And if we do end up having to leave, that would be another boon to Iran , tipping the balance of power in the region. Where, just weeks ago, there were spontaneous protests across Iran against the regime, the killing of Soleimani has taken that pressure off the regime. Trump's impulsive decision may well do more to strengthen Iran's position in the region, than any of Soleimani's plots could have ever accomplished. Whether or not we see more loss of life, more threats against American interests and assets , this is already a debacle. And at what is possibly the most dangerous time in recent American history , at precisely the moment when we should be rallying our allies to stand beside us and hold the line against threats , Donald Trump's short-sighted 'America First' dogmatism has come home to roost. Our closest allies are calling for restraint and de-escalation , on both sides. Making a moral equivalence between us and Iran. Russia and China are quietly reveling in the prospect that the United States may once more be bogged down in another major conflict in the Middle East. They would love nothing more than to be able to pursue their own interests, and carve out their own spheres of influence, without the United States challenging them on human rights, on abusive trade practices, or on meddling in other nations' democracies , because we are too busy fighting Iran. We are alone. And we alone will have to bear the costs of Donald Trump's folly. This is also the moment when we most feel the lack of a functioning national security process or any investment in diplomacy.After three years of hollowing out the State Department; disrespecting and dismissing our intelligence community; destroying the relationship between the White House and Capitol Hill; throwing out the deliberate policy making process that has served Republican and Democratic administrations for decades; corroding the value of the word of the United States; abusing our allies; embracing dictators; creating, not solving, foreign policy crises on the international stage , we are in a much worse position to meet the demands of this crisis than we were when President Obama and I left office. President Trump has no strategy here. No endgame. And here's the hardest truth of all: His constant mistakes and poor decision making have left us with a severely limited slate of options for how to move forward , and most of the options are bad. But there are some key steps that any responsible commander in chief would take. And, while I don't expect Donald Trump will listen to me, I hope he listens to those around him who understand the gravity of the threats we now face. He should take all necessary steps to protect our forces and ensure the security of our diplomats, civilians, and overseas facilities , not just in the Middle East, but anywhere that Iran might strike back. He should ensure that federal authorities are working with states, local governments, and private institutions to guard against the heightened risk of cyber attacks. He should stop tweeting so he doesn't box us in with his threats, such that the only options left to us or Iran are increasingly damaging strikes and counterstrikes. And he should immediately reach out to our European partners and others to send private signals of deterrence and de-escalation to Iran and find a way to avoid the onrush of war. The best way to do that, of course, would be for President Trump, to rejoin the Iran Deal and build on it , if Iran also moves back into compliance with its obligations , and re-establish international consensus about how to confront the threats from Iran. The only way out of this crisis is through diplomacy , clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that's not about one-off decisions or one-upsmanship. Diplomacy that is designed to de-escalate the crisis, protect our people, and secure our regional interests , including our counter-ISIS campaign. No one wants war. But it's going to take hard work to make sure we don't end up there by accident. Finally, and this one's not optional, Mr. President, you have to explain your decisions and your strategy to the American people. That is your job as President , Not Dear Leader, not Supreme Leader. Democracy runs on accountability. And nowhere is that more important than in the power to make war and bring peace. You are required to work with Congress. You are required to abide by the War Powers Resolution. You cannot pursue a war with Iran absent Congressional authority. The existing AUMFs , the Congressional Authorizations for the Use of Military Force , do not apply. The American people do not want, and our Constitution will not abide, a president who rules by fiat and demands obedience. I served in the executive branch of our government for eight years, but I served in the legislative branch for 36 prior to that, and I understand better than anyone that the system will not hold unless we find ways to work together to advance our national interests , not the political interests of one person or one party. We need to restore the balance of powers between the branches of government. We need checks and balances that actually serve to check and balance the worst impulses of our leaders , in any branch. We need to use our system to bring us together as a nation , not abuse it to rip us apart. That's not a na\ufffdve or outdated way of thinking. That's the genius and timelessness of our democratic system, which has, for more than 240 years, allowed us to remake ourselves, reckon with our shortcomings, and move ever forward. That's what we owe to those brave men and women who step forward to wear the uniform of these United States; who dedicate their lives to diplomatic service; who choose to join the Peace Corps or to work in development; who represent the best of our country all around the world , and who are, today, doing so at greater risk because of the actions of our president. Thank you , and in these dangerous times , may God protect our troops."}

In the same year that we commemorate 100 years of women\u2019s suffrage in the United States and honor the incredible courage and accomplishments of all those who fought and suffered for the vote, too many women in our country remain disenfranchised and disadvantaged. Four years after more than 65 million Americans proudly cast their ballot hoping to elect our first female president, we are fighting for the very soul of our nation and to rid the White House of a man who has fostered misogyny, bigotry, racism, and division all across our country. There is no question that women are held to different, often higher standards. They often do more and receive less , less pay, less credit, less encouragement. Harassment, intimidation, threats, violence, and the abuse of power are still pervasive. It shouldn\u2019t still be this way, and I promise that, as president, I will use every tool available to me and take every opportunity to push our nation closer to that aspirational American creed , that all of us are equal in rights and dignity, and deserve equal opportunity. I will promote and prioritize the voices of women, including women of color, in my administration, just as I do in my campaign. Governments, economies, industries, and communities everywhere are made stronger when they include the full participation of women, and the United States must practice what it preaches. My White House and Cabinet will look like America. I have pledged to seek gender parity and full diversity in my national security appointments, and that will be true across my government. We have ample evidence of just how hard it is to break down the entrenched barriers that hold back too many women , but we have an obligation to try with all the strength we have in our hearts. That\u2019s what I will do. And we\u2019ll reclaim America\u2019s leadership to defend and advance women\u2019s rights around the world. Today, on International Women\u2019s Day, we must recommit ourselves to doing better for women everywhere, not just here in the United States. Women are underrepresented in positions of power in most countries around the world. We lose trillions of dollars each year from the global economy because women are excluded from full participation in the economy. One in three women worldwide will experience gender-based violence in her lifetime; that number is even higher for women with disabilities, indigenous women, and LGBTQ+ women. Globally, 130 million girls between the ages of 6 and 17 are not in school; 1 in 5 girls are likely to marry before she turns 18. These statistics are bad for women, and they\u2019re bad for all of us. Yet, instead of continuing the progress that President Obama and I led during our Administration, Donald Trump has abandoned American leadership and adopted policies that directly harm women, including some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations. Trump\u2019s decision to reinstate and expand the global gag rule has had devastating effects on the health and well-being of women around the world, with fewer organizations providing critical healthcare; and his implementation of this rule here in the United States has cut funds to over 900 women\u2019s health clinics that primarily serve women of color. Trump Administration policies have sought to cut funds for global efforts to improve child and maternal health and to halt the spread of HIV\/AIDS. His Administration\u2019s cruel immigration policies have rejected asylum claims for women fleeing horrific gender-based violence and made it much more difficult for foreign women and girls who were trafficked into the United States to obtain visas and receive the medical and social services they need to recover. He has watered down and threatened to veto UN Security Council resolutions that address sexual violence in conflict, making it far more difficult for the international community to hold the perpetrators of such violence accountable and ensure survivors have access to the health and support services they need. As president, I will reverse these setbacks and go further to empower women at home and around the world. I will restore America\u2019s role as a champion for women and girls, revitalize our leadership at the United Nations and on the world stage to unlock the potential of half the world\u2019s population, and renew life-saving investments in women\u2019s health. I will ensure that all U.S. efforts amplify the voices of women leaders around the world, who represent some of the most powerful efforts to confront gender inequality and empower women in their societies. If we are to realize the dream of gender equality, we cannot be disheartened or disengaged. Instead we must recommit to fighting for progress, for our own sake and for the sake of all peoples. That starts by making sure Donald Trump is not reelected.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-international-womens-day-926e1db81c45?source=user_profile---------127----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"On this International Women's Day, in 2020, it's a hard truth that we have not yet reached gender equality in our society.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB1232020120","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-03-12","SpeechTitle":"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President Joe Biden\non Combating Coronavirus (COVID-19)","RawText":"My fellow Americans: Today, across the nation, many of us are feeling anxious about the rapid spread of COVID-19, known as the coronavirus, and the threat it poses to our health, our loved ones, and our livelihoods. I know people are worried, and my thoughts are with all those who are directly fighting this virus , those infected, families that have suffered a loss, our first responders and health care providers who are putting themselves on the line for others. And I\u2019d like to thank those who are already making sacrifices to protect us , whether that\u2019s self-quarantining or cancelling events or closing campuses. Because whether or not you are infected, or know someone who is infected, or have been in contact with an infected person , this will require a national response. Not just from our elected leaders or our public health officials , from all of us. We all must follow the guidance of health officials and take appropriate precautions , to protect ourselves, and critically, to protect others, especially those who are most at-risk from this disease. It will mean making some radical changes to our personal behaviors: more frequent and more through handwashing and staying home from work if you are ill, but also altering some deeply-ingrained habits, like handshakes and hugs, and avoiding large public gatherings. That is why earlier this week, on the recommendation of officials, my campaign cancelled the election night rally we had planned to hold in Cleveland, Ohio. We will also be re-imagining the format for the large-crowd events we had planned in Chicago and Miami in the coming days. And we will continue to assess and adjust how we conduct our campaign as we move forward, and find new ways to share our message with the public, while putting the health and safety of the American people first. Yesterday, we announced a Public Health Advisory Committee of experts who will counsel our campaign and help guide our decisions on steps to minimize the risk. We will be led by the science. The World Health Organization has now officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Downplaying it, being overly dismissive, or spreading misinformation will only hurt us and further advantage the spread of the disease. But neither should we panic or fall back on xenophobia. Labeling COVID-19 a \u201cforeign virus\u201d does not displace accountability for the mismanagement that we have seen from the Trump Administration. Let me be crystal clear: the coronavirus does not have a political affiliation. It will infect Republicans and Democrats alike. It will not discriminate based on national origin,race, gender, or zip code. It will touch people in positions of power and the most vulnerable in our society. A wall will not stop it. Banning all travel from Europe, or any other part of the world, may slow it , but as we have seen , it will not stop it. And travel restrictions based on favoritism and politics , rather than risk , will be counterproductive. This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet. And we need a plan about how we are going to aggressively manage it here at home. The American people have the capacity to meet this moment. We will face this with the same spirit that has guided us through previous crises. We will come together as a nation. We will look out for one another and do our part as citizens. We have to harness the ingenuity of our scientists and the resourcefulness of our people. And we have to lead the world to drive a coordinated global strategy, not shut ourselves off from it. Protecting the health and safety of the American people is the most important job of any president , and unfortunately, this virus has laid bare the severe shortcomingsof the current Administration. Public fears are being compounded by a pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by his adversarial relationship with the truth. Our government\u2019s ability to respond effectively has been undermined by the hollowing-out of our agencies and the disparagement of science. And our ability to drive a global response is dramatically undercut by the damage Trump has done to our credibility and our relationships around the world. We have to get to work immediately to dig ourselves out of this hole. That is why, today, I am releasing a plan to combat and overcome the coronavirus. The full details are on JoeBiden.com laying out the immediate steps we must take to deliver: A decisive public health response to curb the spread of this disease and provide treatment to those in need; and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief to American workers, families, and small businesses , and protects the economy as a whole. I offer it as a roadmap, not for what I will do as president 10 months from now, but for the leadership I believe is required right now, in this moment. President Trump is welcome to adopt it today. The core principle is simple: public health professionals must be the ones making our public health decisions and communicating with the American people. It would be a step toward reclaiming public trust and confidence in the United States government and toward stopping the fear and chaos that can overtake communities faster than this pandemic. And it\u2019s critical to mounting an effective national response that will save lives, protect our front-line health workers, and slow the spread of this virus. First, anyone who needs to be tested based on medical guidelines, should be tested , at no charge. The Administration\u2019s failure on testing is colossal. It is a failure of planning, leadership, and execution. The White House should measure and report each day how many tests were ordered, how many tests have been completed, and how many have tested positive. By next week, the number of tests should be in the millions, not the thousands. We should make sure every person in a nursing home, a senior center, or a vulnerable population has easy access to a test. We should establish hundreds of mobile testing sites , at least 10 per state , and drive-thru testing centers to speed testing and protect health care workers. The CDC, private labs, universities, and manufacturers should be working in lock-step to get this done, and get it done right. No effort should be spared. No excuses should be made. Tests should be available to all who need them and the government should stop at nothing to make that happen. We must know the true extent of this outbreak so we can map it, trace it, and contain it. Nor should we hide the true number of infections in hopes of protecting political interests or the stock market. The markets will respond to strong, steady, capable leadership that addresses the root of the problem, not efforts to cover it up. Second, we need to surge our capability to both prevent and treat the coronavirus, and prepare our hospitals to deal with an influx of those needing care. This means not just getting out the testing kits and processing them quickly, but making sure communities have the hospital beds, the staff, the medical supplies, and the personal protective equipment necessary to treat patients. The president should order FEMA to prepare the capacity with local authorities to establish temporary hospitals with hundreds of beds on short notice. The Department of Defense should prepare for the potential deployment of its resources to provide medical facility capacity and logistical support. A week from now, a month from now, we could need an instant, 500-bed hospital to isolate and treat patients in any city in the country. We can do that , but we aren\u2019t ready yet, and the clock is ticking.As we take these steps, state, federal, and local authorities need to ensure that there is accurate, up-to-date information easily available to every American so everyone can make an informed decision about when to get tested, when to self-quarantine, and when to seek medical treatment. And the federal government should provide states and municipalities with clear guidance about when to trigger more aggressive mitigation policies, such as closing schools. Third, we need to accelerate the development of treatments and a vaccine. Science takes time. It will still be many months before we have a vaccine that can be proven safe for public use and produced in sufficient quantity to make a difference. Therapeutics can and should come sooner. That will save lives. We passed the Cures Act in 2016 to accelerate work at the National Institutes of Health, but now it must have every available resource to speed the process along. We must fast-track clinical trials within the NIH, while closely coordinating with the Food and Drug Administration on trial approvals, so that the science is not hindered by the bureaucracy. And, when we do have a vaccine ready to go, it should also be made widely available, free of charge. We should also immediately restore the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense \u2013with a full-time, dedicated coordinator to oversee the response. Our Administration created that office to better respond to future global health threats after the Ebola crisis in 2014. It was designed for exactly this scenario. President Trump eliminated the office two years ago. Here\u2019s the bottom line: we have to do what is necessary to beat this challenge sooner rather than later. I assure you, if we wait for it to worsen then scramble to catch up, the human and economic toll will be far greater and last far longer. Congress gave the Administration $8 billion last week to fight the virus. We need to know exactly where that money is going, how quickly it is going out the door, and how it is being spent.This brings me to the second half of this challenge , the economic dislocation the coronavirus will cause in our country. We must do whatever it takes, spend whatever it takes, to deliver relief for our families and ensure the stability of our economy. Taking immediate, bold measures to help Americans who are hurting economically right now. It means we will need bigger and broader measures to shore up economic demand, protect jobs, keep credit flowing to our job creators, and make sure we have the economic fire power we need to weather this storm and get our people and this economy back to full strength as soon as possible.This crisis will hit everyone, but it will hit folks who live paycheck-to-paycheck the hardest, including working people and seniors. Another tax cut to Google or Goldman or millionaires won\u2019t get the job done. Indiscriminate corporate tax subsidies won\u2019t effectively target those who really need help. We need to place our focus on those who will struggle just to get by. People are already losing jobs , we need to replace their wages.That includes workers in the gig economy who lack unemployment insurance.Parents who are already struggling with childcare costs , we need to give them relief. Children who rely on school lunches will need food.And schools will need help ensuring children who do not have easy access to computers can still learn if their schools close. People who have difficulty paying their rent or mortgage because they\u2019ve been laid off or had their hours cut back , we need to help them stay in their homes. Small businesses that will be devastated as customers stay home and events are canceled , we need to make sure they have access to interest-free loans. It is a national disgrace that millions of our fellow citizens do not have a single day of paid sick leave. We need , both , a permanent plan for paid sick leave and an emergency plan for everyone who needs it due to the outbreak. Beyond these national measures, my plan also calls for the creation of a State and Local Emergency Fund to make sure governors, mayors, and local leaders who are battling coronavirus on the ground have the resources necessary to meet this crisis head on.These funds could be used at the discretion of local leaders for whatever they most need: expanding critical health infrastructure, hiring additional health care and emergency service personnel, or cushioning the wider economic blow this virus will cause our communities. We need smart, bold, and compassionate leadership that will help contain the crisis, reduce hardship to our people, and help our economy rebound. But let me be clear: this is just a start. We must prepare now to take further decisive action, including direct relief, that will be large in scale and focused on the broader health and stability of our economy. But we can only protect the health of our economy, if we do everything in our power to protect the health of our people.The last point I want to make today is this , we will never fully solve this problem if we are unwilling to look beyond our own borders and engage fully with the world. A disease that starts any place on the planet can be on a plane to any city on earth a few hours later. So we have to confront coronavirus everywhere. We should be leading a coordinated, global response, just as we did for Ebola, that draws on the incredible capability of the U.S. Agency for International Development and our State Department to assist vulnerable nations in detecting and treating coronavirus wherever it is spreading. We should be investing in rebuilding and strengthening the Global Health Security Agenda, which we launched during our Administration, specifically to mobilize the world against the threat of new infectious diseases. It can be hard to see the concrete value of this work when everything seems well with the world. But by cutting our investments in global health, this Administration has left us woefully ill-prepared for the exact crisis we now face. No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I\u2019m president, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better.We will lead with science. We will listen to experts and heed their advice. We will rebuild American leadership and rally the world to meet global threats. And I will always, always tell you the truth. That is the responsibility of a president. That is what is owed to the American people. Now, and in the difficult days that still lie ahead, I know that this country will summon our spirit of empathy, decency, and unity. Because, in times of crisis, Americans stand as one. Volunteers raise their hands to help. Neighbors look out for neighbors. Businesses take care of their workers. So we will meet this challenge , together. Thank you all.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-combating-coronavirus-covid-19-4228f77e9ea?source=user_profile---------126----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"My fellow Americans: Today, across the nation, many of us are feeling anxious about the rapid spread of COVID-19, known as the coronavirus, and the threat it poses to our health, our loved ones, and our livelihoods.

But we can only protect the health of our economy, if we do everything in our power to protect the health of our people.The last point I want to make today is this , we will never fully solve this problem if we are unwilling to look beyond our own borders and engage fully with the world. A disease that starts any place on the planet can be on a plane to any city on earth a few hours later. So we have to confront coronavirus everywhere. We should be leading a coordinated, global response, just as we did for Ebola, that draws on the incredible capability of the U.S. Agency for International Development and our State Department to assist vulnerable nations in detecting and treating coronavirus wherever it is spreading. We should be investing in rebuilding and strengthening the Global Health Security Agenda, which we launched during our Administration, specifically to mobilize the world against the threat of new infectious diseases. It can be hard to see the concrete value of this work when everything seems well with the world. But by cutting our investments in global health, this Administration has left us woefully ill-prepared for the exact crisis we now face. No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I'm president, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better.We will lead with science. We will listen to experts and heed their advice. We will rebuild American leadership and rally the world to meet global threats. And I will always, always tell you the truth. That is the responsibility of a president. That is what is owed to the American people. Now, and in the difficult days that still lie ahead, I know that this country will summon our spirit of empathy, decency, and unity. Because, in times of crisis, Americans stand as one. Volunteers raise their hands to help. Neighbors look out for neighbors. Businesses take care of their workers. So we will meet this challenge , together. Thank you all."}

The people of this country know how to answer the call in a crisis. They know that now is a time for empathy, decency, and unity.The Congress is hard at work at economic measures to help working people, families, and seniors cope with the economic blow. So many governors, mayors, and other local officials on the front lines of the pandemic are making tough decisions to protect their communities and modeling the leadership we need from our elected officials. They deserve a partner in the White House.Much has been made of changes in the President\u2019s tone in recent days. But with our health care system at risk, a virus spreading, our economy on the brink , and so many lives at stake , it\u2019s time to be less interested in the President\u2019s words and more focused on his actions , or inaction.Here\u2019s what President Trump needs to do, immediately:First, he must institute a transparent reporting process regarding testing. While it\u2019s good that the number of tests are increasing, it\u2019s not good enough. Other countries have had the tests they\u2019ve needed, when they\u2019ve needed them. The United States hasn\u2019t , and still doesn\u2019t. Last week, I called for the Administration to report every single day on how many tests have been ordered, how many have been conducted, and how many have produced positive results. That reporting still is not happening. It must.Second, President Trump must take action to expand the number of beds and facilities ready to accept sick patients. Last week, I called for using our Department of Defense resources and the deployment of the National Guard, if necessary, to help support the response. I\u2019m proud to see governors taking this step and acting in the interests of their communities. And I\u2019m pleased that the Pentagon announced yesterday that it is opening its labs, prepping its hospital ships, and making equipment like respirator masks and ventilators available. The Trump Administration should act now to prepare for the deployment of beds and facilities.Third, President Trump must surge medical personnel to the places that need it most and make sure these personnel and first responders are equipped to more safely do their jobs. As I called for last week, this should include expanding and mobilizing the Medical Reserve Corps, which consists of nearly 200,000 volunteer health care professionals who stand ready to serve across America. And, this should include standing up a reserve Corps for the U.S. Public Health Service so we have the medical and public health expertise available to deploy to areas of need. It should also include adapting FEMA just-in-time training for first responders through the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, the Center for Domestic Preparedness, and the Emergency Management Institute. And all of our medical personnel and first responders should have the personal protective equipment they need to ensure they can do their jobs safely and effectively.This leads to a final point: Vital equipment is in short supply, including personal protective equipment for health care providers and first responders, basic supplies for lab technicians, and ventilators for patients. One reason for that is Trump\u2019s misguided trade war with China, which led to tariffs on essential medical supplies and reduced their availability in the United States.Today, I am calling on the Trump Administration to take the following steps immediately:(1) Level with the American people by providing accurate and complete information on:(2) Prioritize and immediately increase domestic production of any critical medical equipment required to respond to this crisis , such as the production of ventilators and associated training to operate , by invoking the Defense Production Act, delegating authority to HHS and FEMA. This action must be built on forecasted demand, using the best modeling currently available for negative scenarios. It would involve:The Administration should provide a regular update to the public on the status of all of these steps, which should be taken under the guidance and direction of experts and public health and emergency response professionals. Also, Congress gave the White House more than $8 billion to fight the virus 12 days ago. The White House should report weekly on how quickly and well that money is being used.Americans are already making sacrifices and readjusting their lives, and I know that as a people, we are capable of meeting this challenge, coming together, caring for one another, and saving lives. We just need President Trump and his Administration to demonstrate the same level of dedication and aggressive leadership at the federal level to mount an effective national response.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-immediate-actions-the-trump-administration-must-take-to-57857de533b8?source=user_profile---------124----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"My heart goes out to all Americans who are suffering from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus , those who are sick, those who are caring for others, those who have lost loved ones, those who cannot spend time with family members due to social distancing, and those who are already dealing with the economic fallout.I'm so proud of Americans across the country who are driving a community-led response, despite the sacrifices and hardship that can entail, and by helping their neighbors.

Last week, I had the honor of speaking to all of you from Philadelphia, the birthplace of the foundational documents of our democracy. Tonight, in keeping with the latest guidance from the CDC to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people, I am speaking to you from my home in Wilmington. I hope that all of you are staying safe, taking the recommended precautions to keep social distance, and slow the spread of the coronavirus. This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives, and every aspect of this campaign. My heart goes out to all those who have lost a loved one, to those who have contracted the virus, and to all of the brave Americans who are working harder than ever to help their neighbors. Doctors, nurses, EMTs, and public health officials, as well as front line emergency workers like fire fighters and the dedicated folks working to keep the shelves stocked in grocery stores. Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war. It will require leadership and cooperation from every level of government. It will require us to move thoughtfully and decisively to quickly address both the public health crisis and the economic crisis we\u2019re in. It will require us to pay attention to the medical and scientific and health experts. And it will require each and every one of us to do our part. Yes, this is a moment where we need our leaders to lead. But it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals, and collectively as a people, will make a big difference in the severity of the outbreak and the ability of our medical and hospital systems to handle it. I know that we as a people are up to this challenge. I know that we will answer this moment of crisis with what is best in ourselves , because that is what Americans have always done. That\u2019s who we are. And today, even as we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge, Americans in three states went to the polls. I want to thank all the public officials and the poll workers who worked closely with public health authorities to assure safe opportunities for voting , to clean and disinfect voting booths and to make sure that voters could cast their ballots while maintaining distance from one another. It is important for us to get through this crisis, protecting both the public health and our democracy. Today, it looks like, once again, in Florida and in Illinois , and we\u2019re still waiting to hear in Arizona , our campaign has had a very good night. And we\u2019ve moved closer to securing the Democratic party\u2019s nomination for president. We\u2019re doing it by building the broad coalition that we will need to win in November with strong support from the African American community; the Latino community; high school educated people, like the ones I grew up with in my old neighborhood; labor; teachers, suburban women, veterans, fire fighters, and so many more. And we\u2019re doing it with a common vision. Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision , for the need to provide affordable health care for all Americans to reducing income inequality to taking on climate change. Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought remarkable passion and tenacity to these issues, and together, they have shifted the fundamental conversation in the country. And let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you. I know what is at stake. And I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president, is to unify our party , and to unify our nation. It\u2019s at moments like these that we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans. The coronavirus doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Democrat or a Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or zip code. It will touch people in positions of power and the most vulnerable in our society. We are all in this together. This is a moment for each of us to see and believe in the best in every one of us. To look out for our neighbor. To understand the fear and stress so many are feeling. To care for the elderly couple down the street. To thank the health workers and the doctors and the nurses and the pharmacists and the grocery store cashiers and the people re-stocking the shelves. To believe in one another. Because I assure you , when we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we\u2019ll lift this nation up, and we\u2019ll get through this together. May God bless you all , and we say a special prayer for those on the front lines of this crisis , the doctors, the nurses, the health care workers caring for virus victims and their families.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-joe-biden-in-wilmington-de-149e7863838e?source=user_profile---------125----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Good evening everyone.

Individuals and families are stepping up to do their part , staying home, taking individual precautions and implementing social distancing, and making donations to support food banks and other vital service providers, all to protect those most at-risk from the virus in our communities. Their level of dedication should be matched by their elected leaders.At a time of national emergency, which is laying bare the existing vulnerabilities in our health infrastructure, it is unconscionable that you are continuing to pursue a lawsuit designed to strip millions of Americans of their health insurance and protections under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including the ban on insurers denying coverage or raising premiums due to pre-existing conditions. No American should have the added worry right now that you are in court trying to take away their health care. You are letting partisan rancor and politics threaten the lives of your constituents, and that is a dereliction of your sworn duty. I am therefore calling on each of you to drop your support of litigation to repeal the ACA.This Monday, March 23, marks 10 years since President Obama signed into law the ACA. It was , and still is , a big deal for our country, because having health insurance isn\u2019t just about being able to access health care when you need it, it\u2019s about the peace of mind that comes from knowing that if your kid gets sick, you will be able to get them the care they need, or that if you have an accident, you won\u2019t have to also worry about how to pay your medical bills. During a public health crisis, it\u2019s part of the assurance that you can seek the treatment you and your loved ones need. I was proud to stand with President Obama every day of our Administration, but no day more so than when he signed the ACA, because of the real security it delivered for every day American families.Since 2010, 20 million Americans have gained access to health insurance coverage. But the ACA also helps tens of millions more Americans across the country. It is the reason 100 million people with pre-existing conditions , including conditions like asthma and diabetes that make them at higher-risk for adverse health impacts from the coronavirus , don\u2019t have to worry about being charged more or denied coverage. It is the reason insurance companies can\u2019t tell patients that they\u2019ve hit an annual or lifetime cap on care.The litigation you are supporting , Texas v. California , jeopardizes every single one of those protections and threatens the peace of mind and access to care for hundreds of millions of Americans. There is no underlying constitutional flaw with the Affordable Care Act. In fact, the Supreme Court twice upheld the constitutionality of the law. The only reason this new case gained traction was because Congressional Republicans decided to amend the law and zero-out the penalty for not being insured, and legal experts from across the ideological spectrum have concluded that this new argument , that this change invalidates the entire law , is legally unsupportable.The purpose of your suit is to destroy the ACA. Make no mistake: If the ACA did not exist right now, in this public health crisis, tens of millions of people would not have health insurance. 100 million would not have protections for the kind of underlying conditions that make them even more vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19. Insurance companies would be allowed to place caps on care provided to individuals. And if you succeed in killing it next year, you\u2019ll put countless Americans at risk in the next pandemic.If there was ever a moment to set aside politics, it is now. I have called for making all testing, treatment, and any eventual vaccine free of charge, regardless of whether an individual is insured. That is what is needed to defeat this virus. The last thing we need right now is people avoiding seeking care because they can\u2019t afford it. But people will still have medical needs not directly related to COVID-19, which is why every American needs access to high-quality, affordable health insurance and the pre-existing condition protections that the law guarantees.You have in your power the ability to make life safer, healthier, and a little bit easier for your constituents. All you have to do is drop your support for this ill-conceived lawsuit, which is even more dangerous and cruel in this moment of national crisis. History will judge all of us by how we respond to this pandemic. The public health imperative we now face is bigger than politics, and it requires all of us to summon the courage to lead and to do what is right for the American people.Thank you,Joseph R. Biden, Jr.47th Vice President of the United States","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/joe-biden-presses-donald-trump-and-state-elected-officials-to-drop-lawsuit-attacking-americans-3e999265f3ed?source=user_profile---------121----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Dear President Trump, State Attorneys General, and Governor Reeves,All across this nation, Americans are anxious and afraid about the impact the deadly COVID-19 pandemic is already having on their lives, their families, and their ability to pay their bills.

The only reason this new case gained traction was because Congressional Republicans decided to amend the law and zero-out the penalty for not being insured, and legal experts from across the ideological spectrum have concluded that this new argument , that this change invalidates the entire law , is legally unsupportable.The purpose of your suit is to destroy the ACA. Make no mistake: If the ACA did not exist right now, in this public health crisis, tens of millions of people would not have health insurance. 100 million would not have protections for the kind of underlying conditions that make them even more vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19. Insurance companies would be allowed to place caps on care provided to individuals. And if you succeed in killing it next year, you'll put countless Americans at risk in the next pandemic.If there was ever a moment to set aside politics, it is now. I have called for making all testing, treatment, and any eventual vaccine free of charge, regardless of whether an individual is insured. That is what is needed to defeat this virus. The last thing we need right now is people avoiding seeking care because they can't afford it. But people will still have medical needs not directly related to COVID-19, which is why every American needs access to high-quality, affordable health insurance and the pre-existing condition protections that the law guarantees.You have in your power the ability to make life safer, healthier, and a little bit easier for your constituents. All you have to do is drop your support for this ill-conceived lawsuit, which is even more dangerous and cruel in this moment of national crisis. History will judge all of us by how we respond to this pandemic. The public health imperative we now face is bigger than politics, and it requires all of us to summon the courage to lead and to do what is right for the American people."}

And it\u2019s simply wrong. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. The White House and the Senate Republicans have proposed a $500 billion slush fund for corporations, with almost no conditions. Donald Trump\u2019s Treasury Secretary would decide which big businesses get how much, and he can give out billions with virtually no strings attached. The Trump Administration could even allow companies to use taxpayers\u2019 money for stock buybacks and executive pay packages, and they don\u2019t have to tell Americans where the money is going for months. This is par for the course for this president. We have just watched too many CEOs spend the last few years squandering the massive Trump corporate tax cuts on buying back their own stock and increasing their own compensation, rather than investing in their workers or making their businesses more sustainable. No more blank checks to corporations. Any lifelines to big companies should ensure the aid lifts up workers, instead of enriching CEOs or shareholders. If these companies are taking money from taxpayers, they must make an enforceable commitment that they will keep workers on payroll. We can\u2019t let Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell hold small businesses, workers, and communities hostage until they get their no-strings corporate bailout. McConnell should immediately allow a bipartisan vote on aggressive measures to help small businesses, workers, and communities first, so the relief they need can get moving. To make matters worse, as they carry water for corporate America, President Trump and Mitch McConnell are refusing to give states and communities on the front lines the help they need to deal with the crisis they are facing. They are refusing to provide sufficient, sustainable relief to workers. They are denying millions the emergency paid leave they deserve to help keep families safe. They are refusing to forgive a minimum of $10,000 of student debt per person. They are refusing to increase Social Security benefits for our seniors and people with disabilities. They are refusing to provide enough health coverage or Medicaid funding during a public health emergency. And they are refusing to take the necessary steps to ensure food and nutrition for vulnerable families or to prevent these families from losing their homes. This is a time to help families, communities, and small businesses.

Social Security checks need to be boosted. Student debt should be forgiven. Cash relief needs to go out fast to all of the people who need it the most. These are the hardworking, struggling Americans who should come first , not the big corporations looking for a blank check. That\u2019s not only good economics.

Bernie has put his heart and soul into not only running for President, but for the causes and issues he has been dedicated to his whole life. So, I know how hard a decision this was for him to make , and how hard it is for the millions of his supporters , especially younger voters , who have been inspired and energized and brought into politics by the progressive agenda he has championed. Bernie has done something rare in politics. He hasn\u2019t just run a political campaign; he\u2019s created a movement. And make no mistake about it, I believe it\u2019s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That\u2019s a good thing for our nation and our future.Senator Sanders and his supporters have changed the dialogue in America. Issues which had been given little attention , or little hope of ever passing , are now at the center of the political debate. Income inequality, universal health care, climate change, free college, relieving students from the crushing debt of student loans. These are just a few of the issues Bernie and his supporters have given life to. And while Bernie and I may not agree on how we might get there, we agree on the ultimate goal for these issues and many more.But more than any one issue or set of issues, I want to commend Bernie for being a powerful voice for a fairer and more just America. It\u2019s voices like Bernie\u2019s that refuse to allow us to just accept what is , that refuse to accept we can\u2019t change what\u2019s wrong in our nation , that refuse to accept the health and well-being of our fellow citizens and our planet isn\u2019t our responsibility too. Bernie gets a lot of credit for his passionate advocacy for the issues he cares about. But he doesn\u2019t get enough credit for being a voice that forces us all to take a hard look in the mirror and ask if we\u2019ve done enough.While the Sanders campaign has been suspended , its impact on this election and on elections to come is far from over. We will address the existential crisis of climate change. We will confront income inequality in our nation. We will make sure healthcare is affordable and accessible to every American. We will make education at our public colleges and universities free. We will ease the burden of student debt. And, most important of all, we will defeat Donald Trump.At this moment, we are in the middle of an unprecedented crisis in American history. There is enormous fear and pain and loss being felt all across the country. There are also untold stories of heroism , of nurses and health care workers and doctors and first responders and grocery store workers and truck drivers and so many others on the front lines of this crisis. Putting their own lives in danger for the rest of us. If we didn\u2019t know it before, we know it now: This is the backbone of our nation.Our first job is to get through the immediate crisis threatening the public health and getting help into the pockets of America\u2019s workers. But we also need to take a hard look at what we need to fix and change in this country. Many of the biggest cracks in the social safety net have been laid bare , from health care to paid sick leave to a more extensive and comprehensive system of unemployment benefits. We will need to address these. Just as we need to address rebuilding our nation\u2019s infrastructure.

We\u2019re all worried about our health and our families. And for the millions who have lost their jobs or had their hours slashed, you may also be worried about just making ends meet. As a nation, we are being tested as never before, and I want to offer my heartfelt sympathies to all those who have lost loved ones to this virus as well as my heartfelt gratitude to all the frontline workers who are literally carrying our nation on their backs.This pandemic is shining a light on so many inequities in our society , the lack of paid sick leave for workers, the need for stronger unemployment insurance, the necessity for a livable minimum wage. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s also amplifying the structural racism that is built into so much of our daily lives, our institutions, our laws, and our communities.An early data analysis from the Washington Post indicates that counties with majority-Black populations have coronavirus infection rates three times higher than counties with majority white residents, with death rates nearly six times higher. In some parts of the country, Latinos appear to be harder hit as well. And, we\u2019ve also seen reports of climbing infections and death tolls among the Navajo Nation and fears about the disproportionate impact the virus could have on Indian Country.It\u2019s unconscionable, and it shouldn\u2019t be the case in the United States of America in the 21st century. But we know exactly why it is: Black, Latino, and Native Americans are still less likely to have health insurance. Less likely to have access to health care. More likely to have underlying conditions, like asthma and diabetes, that make them more vulnerable to this virus. And, more likely to face exposure to air pollutants that may be associated with higher COVID-19 death rates. Black and Latino Americans are also less likely to have a job they can just do from home. Meaning they\u2019re more likely to have to choose between their health and a paycheck.This pandemic has shown us the importance of leading with science and following the data , but we can\u2019t follow the data if we don\u2019t have it. That\u2019s why I join my Democratic colleagues Senator Warren, Congresswoman Pressley, Senator Harris, Senator Booker, Congresswoman Kelly, and others in calling on the CDC and other agencies to release more data about how COVID-19 is hurting our communities. Not just data on age, but also on income and race, so we can focus resources on where help is needed first and fastest.This virus can hit anyone, anywhere , regardless of race, economic status, or access to power , but it doesn\u2019t impact every community equally. It hits hardest those who are most vulnerable and who have the fewest resources. The challenge for us as leaders is ensuring support gets to those who need it immediately, and doing the necessary work to rip out the structural racism that creates these inequalities wherever we find it.We can do better for all our people. We have to.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-racial-inequities-of-covid-19-5e4f17f8fa0c?source=user_profile---------111----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"This is an anxious, difficult time for Americans all across this nation.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB942020106","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-04-09","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden Outlines New Steps to Ease Economic Burden on Working People","RawText":"Two important steps we can take to help ease the economic burden on working people , and that I will take when I am President.The news this morning of another enormous number of unemployment claims , on top of the ten million that have already been filed , is devastating. These numbers represent catastrophic losses to our economy, but most importantly, they represent the loss of livelihood for millions of people across this country struggling to pay the rent, put food on the table, and keep the electricity on.These aren\u2019t statistics this morning , these are people. They are fathers, mothers, aunts, uncles, sons, daughters, and grandparents who have lost their jobs.The economic crisis brought on by this virus is both accelerating and deepening. These unemployment numbers today are another flashing warning sign that our country and our people will endure enormous economic pain. It is our responsibility to move quickly and effectively to help them.Congress has moved to help with the CARES Act, but they must do more. In addition to funds to keep workers on payroll, the next recovery package will need to provide significant funds to states, to make sure that educators and health care workers and first responders can keep getting paid. It will have to provide hazard pay to frontline workers putting themselves at risk. It will have to provide health care coverage for millions who lose their insurance, by allowing them to stay on their health care plans and covering the cost, as well as reopening enrollment for Obamacare and creating the public option I\u2019ve been calling for. It will have to extend unemployment benefits, and provide further direct cash relief, and take care of the people left out of the CARES Act, through an immediate cancellation of a minimum of $10,000 of student debt per person, as proposed by Senator Warren, and Social Security boosts. And so much more.And we must , must , make sure not only that every American can be tested for coronavirus free of cost, but also make sure every American can be treated for coronavirus free of cost. Period.And that\u2019s just immediate relief. Then comes recovery. Recovery will require long term changes to build a more inclusive and more resilient middle class, and a greener and more resilient economy. We have to think big , as big as the challenges we face. As we start to lay the groundwork for recovery, we have to build back better for the future.So, as the next step in building on the progressive vision for the country that I have laid out across the course of my campaign, today I\u2019m announcing my intention to fight for two new policies that I believe will not only help people right now when they may need the help most, but will also help people find more secure footing in the long term once we have emerged from this crisis. The first is lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 60, and the second is forgiving student debt for low-income and middle class people who have attended public colleges and universities.And to be clear , these are priorities now, but they will be my program when I am President.Lowering the Medicare Eligibility Age to 6,I have directed my team to develop a plan to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60.Under this concept, Americans would have access, if they choose, to Medicare when they turn 60, instead of when they turn 65. Medicare benefits would be provided to them as they are to current Medicare recipients. This would make Medicare available to a set of Americans who work hard and retire before they turn 65, or who would prefer to leave their employer plans, the public option, or other plans they access through the Affordable Care Act before they retire. It reflects the reality that, even after the current crisis ends, older Americans are likely to find it difficult to secure jobs.Of course, those who prefer to remain on their employer plans would be permitted to do so, and employers would have to comply with non-discrimination laws and would be prohibited from excluding older workers from coverage or otherwise try to push them out of their plans. And the Biden Medicare-like public option , as well as other subsidized private plans available to individuals through the Affordable Care Act , would remain available.Any new Federal cost associated with this option would be financed out of general revenues to protect the Medicare Trust Fund.Forgiving student debt for low-income and middle class individuals who have attended public colleges and universitie,I\u2019ve also directed my team to develop a plan to forgive federal student debt relating to the cost of tuition currently held by low-income and middle-class people for undergraduate public colleges and universities, as well as private Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and private, underfunded Minority-Serving Institution (MSIs).The concept I\u2019m announcing today will align my student debt relief proposal with my forward-looking college tuition proposal. Under this plan, I propose to forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities for debt-holders earning up to $125,000, with appropriate phase-outs to avoid a cliff. The federal government would pay the monthly payment in lieu of the borrower until the forgivable portion of the loan was paid off. This benefit would also apply to individuals holding federal student loans for tuition from private HBCUs and MSIs.This proposal would be in addition to my existing student debt proposals:I would finance this new student debt proposal by repealing the high-income \u201cexcess business losses\u201d tax cut in the CARES Act. That tax cut overwhelmingly benefits the richest Americans and is unnecessary for addressing the current COVID-19 economic relief efforts.I will be releasing more detail on both of these proposals in the future But I believe that as we are being plunged into what is likely to be one of the most volatile and difficult economic times in this country\u2019s recent history, we can take these critical steps to help make it easier for working people to make ends meet. Senator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas, and I\u2019m proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis.In our nation\u2019s 244 years, we have never weathered a crisis that we did not emerge from stronger. This one will be no different. Americans will come together and take care of each other , we are already seeing it every day. Doctors, nurses and hospital workers putting their own safety aside to care for others. Neighbors looking out for neighbors who need extra help. We can do anything we put our minds to, even in the most difficult times , and includes rebuilding for a better future.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/joe-biden-outlines-new-steps-to-ease-economic-burden-on-working-people-e3e121037322?source=user_profile---------112----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Two important steps we can take to help ease the economic burden on working people , and that I will take when I am President.The news this morning of another enormous number of unemployment claims , on top of the ten million that have already been filed , is devastating.

But let\u2019s not forget: these measures are required to the extent they are because we didn\u2019t prepare early enough, and when the virus surfaced in our communities, we didn\u2019t test sufficiently to contain it. This pain is a product of poor decision making by Donald Trump.With true American spirit, workers did not hesitate to sacrifice to save the lives of fellow citizens. But even as we temporarily shrink economic activity, there\u2019s no reason why the incomes of working people must shrink, too.As we navigate this crisis, our paramount economic priority must be to make American workers whole, so they retain their income and benefits during this period of social distancing. For the workers that are laid off, we should swiftly compensate for lost wages and health benefits for all of them, not just those who can make it through the bureaucracy.But we should also be doing more , much more , to reduce the number of people who are laid off in the first place. We should be committed to keeping as many people as possible attached to their employment, so they can easily return to work when appropriate, and maintain their income and benefits.This is more than just the right thing to do , it is the surest road to a rapid recovery, because the faster everyone returns to their jobs, the faster we can improve demand and get our economy running again.The Trump Administration has been given a number of extraordinary tools to make this happen , to keep people employed. Yet, they are failing to use them effectively. For more people to stay in their jobs, Donald Trump has to do his job.As this crisis continues to unfold, I will be putting forward ideas to not only better address the immediate needs of working Americans, but also what is needed for long-term, structural reform to make our economy work for all its people.So today, as we see these chilling numbers of job losses , each one a mother or father, a neighbor or friend, a proud, hardworking American , I am calling for a bigger and bolder approach to keeping people on the job in times of crisis. That idea is called \u201cshort-time compensation\u201d or \u201cwork-sharing.\u201d I call it Employment Insurance.The Biden Plan to Scale Up Employment Insurance by Reforming Short-Time Compensation Program,Transform unemployment insurance into Employment Insurance for millions of workers by getting all 50 states to adopt and dramatically scale up short-time compensation programs. Under short-time compensation , also known as work sharing , firms in distress keep workers employed but at reduced hours and the federal government helps make up the difference in wages. The Obama-Biden administration championed this approach in the U.S., and so far 27 states have established short-time compensation programs.These programs must become more flexible and attractive to both employers and employees, so that as many workers as possible can remain attached to their jobs and receive full wages and health benefits during crisis times, even if employers must significantly cut their hours.Germany has long used short-time work programs to protect jobs in recessions, so that workers are ready to hit the ground running as the economy improves. And this approach is especially well suited to the current moment, when we can expect a more gradual recovery in certain sectors, with some businesses operating a partial capacity for an extended period.In short, we should start thinking of this as Employment Insurance more than Unemployment Insurance.For the current crisis, the administration should move rapidly to scale up short-time compensation to save or restore millions of jobs. Specifically:These are crisis measures, but we can and should do more to strengthen short-time compensation to prevent layoffs in future downturns, learning lessons from other nations and from those states in America that have been leading the way.As President, Joe Biden would pursue permanent reform of short-time compensation, through the following steps:Build automatic triggers based on economic and public health conditions. Enhancements to short-time compensation and unemployment insurance tied to the COVID-19 crisis should be automatically extended based on economic and health conditions, and renewed in future crises.

But in a moment of choice, Americans all across this country took action. On April 22, 1970, 20 million people turned out to educate their communities and protest the degradation of our planet, launching the modern environmental movement.It wasn\u2019t a partisan issue. It wasn\u2019t some ideological debate. Everyone could see that our planet was in peril. And by acting together, those activists seized the attention and the imagination of people all over the world, as well as leaders in Washington. Out of that first Earth Day came the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Act of 1970, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and a new mindset that awakened all of us to our responsibilities beyond just the world we leave our children , to ensuring that our one planet will provide for generations unborn.This year, Earth Day comes amid global crises: the difficult, immediate, and undeniable reality of pandemic disease, and the existential threat of climate change , which we are already experiencing and which threatens equally deadly results in the near future if we fail to act. COVID-19 and the climate emergency both underscore the fragility of life on this planet, the connections that bind us to our fellow humans, and the responsibility we all have to meet these global threats with urgent action, ambitious plans, and every tool at our disposal.That\u2019s the responsibility I feel every time I look at my grandchildren and see their unlimited potential. Or when I hear from young activists who understand that inaction today is costing their futures. Today\u2019s young people carry the same fierce spirit as those first Earth Day activists, and they are the reason I know we will succeed in spurring the world to finally raise our ambitions to meet the seriousness of this threat.This is an inflection point. A moment for all of us to come together to repair the damage to our environment caused by centuries of poorly regulated industrialization. But out of this crisis, we can also seize a moment of unmatched opportunity , to build a new, clean-energy future that remakes our economy, creates millions of good jobs that provide an opportunity to join a union, and revolutionizes our approach to environmental justice. To invest in a green infrastructure. To develop the technologies that will power tomorrow. To strengthen our resilience in the face of the impacts of climate change that we are already experiencing. To clean the air we breath and the water we drink. To revitalize our ocean and preserve our biodiversity. To deliver to our children and future generations a planet that will continue to protect and nurture them.Meeting the threat of climate change is not beyond our skill, if we are guided by science and facts. We are not helpless. We can still forestall the worst-case scenarios that the scientists have warned us about for decades , but only if we act now. If we do not take aggressive steps to rein in our greenhouse gasses, and put our world on a radically different path by 2030, we will begin to see irrevocable changes that will threaten human life on Earth.Yet, since almost the day he took office, President Donald Trump has done everything within his power to worsen the situation, sabotage our environmental protection laws and let polluters go unchecked, and reverse any progress on climate change , not just in the United States, but around the world. He denies the facts in front of his face as well as the assessments of his own intelligence analysts and government researchers. He muzzles scientists, censors research, and overruled California\u2019s efforts to lead on climate in the absence of the federal government. He has rolled back nearly 100 commonsense regulations and functionally rescinded environmental laws governing our health and safety , air pollution went up in 2017 and 2018 after decades of improvement, and Trump has stripped protections that keep our drinking water safe.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB224202099","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-04-22","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden Calls on Trump Administration to Ensure that Relief Funds Get to Deserving Small Businesses","RawText":"As Congress reaches a new deal on economic relief measures, including more funds for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small businesses, I am grateful to Democratic leaders for securing more funds for hospitals and testing, and more resources for smaller lenders and community-based financial institutions, as well as the depleted Emergency Injury Disaster Loan and Emergency Economic Injury Grant programs. These hard-fought improvements will help deserving small businesses who were shut out in the first round of funding. Let\u2019s be clear: It wasn\u2019t just a shortage of funds in the PPP that kept so many small business owners , men and women who have put their work lives, savings, heart, and soul into their businesses , from getting loans. Many had the door shut in their face , businesses like auto mechanics and main street shop owners and restaurant and bar proprietors. Many were pushed to the back of the line by chain restaurants, biotechnology companies, well-off consultants, investors, accountants, and lawyers who shouldn\u2019t have even been in line in the first place. This was intended to be an economic crisis program to prevent the shuttering of our truly small businesses that were the most deserving , not the best connected. It was intended to be about how many jobs a small business owner could save, not how much they paid a high-priced accountant. Before the first application had been submitted for the first penny, I was demanding that Trump use his full authority to make sure every bank understood their mandate to help every small business who came through their doors or websites or phone lines. For weeks, I have been warning Trump that the funds \u201cshould be available to every single eligible small business, regardless of how small they are, where they are located, or how well-connected their owner is.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t listen. Consider this from early estimates:Trump and his team let banks slam doors in the face of small business owners trying to save their workers and their businesses. Under the way the Trump team administered the program, it was A-OK for a major bank like Bank of America to tell family-owned businesses that if they had relied on loved ones and not a big bank for loans in the past, their application was denied, no questions asked. Think about this: the three biggest lenders earned hundreds of millions of dollars in fees from the government for the privilege of excluding mom-and-pop businesses in favor of their larger existing clients. That was not an accident , the Trump team knew and let it happen. The Trump Administration also allowed big banks to shut the door in the face of the owner of a family restaurant, while letting major restaurant corporations in this country get their franchisees first in line for millions and millions of dollars. Again, this was not by mistake. It was permitted. I\u2019m glad that Shake Shack is giving the money back, but a lot of the others aren\u2019t. And we shouldn\u2019t have to count on the conscience of the CEO , the Trump Administration should simply be saying no. African-American small business owners , who currently rely far more on friends and family than big banks, have been shut-out of the PPP in numbers that are disgraceful. Again, by Trump\u2019s design. And, while the Trump Administration adopted an approach to disadvantage the truly small businesses facing devastation, they also adopted an approach to help their high-priced friends. This fund is running out because they allowed boutique consulting, investment, legal and accounting firms , who were doing just fine , to receive millions they did not deserve. Let\u2019s not pretend the program is working for everyone. It\u2019s not. In addition to adding resources, let\u2019s fix it. Let\u2019s get the funds to the folks who deserve it. We may still be in the early innings of the policy response, but we need to help our workers and small businesses, so we need to get this right before any new funds go out.Joe Biden\u2019s Proposals to Support Deserving Small Businesse,Here\u2019s what Joe Biden thinks we should do now that Congress has secured more funding: 1. Establish a True Small Business Fund: Congressional Democrats secured a set-aside of $60 billion in funds for smaller lenders and community-based financial institutions, which are frequently best positioned to get resources into the hands of deserving small businesses in vulnerable communities. Joe Biden is calling on the Trump Administration to go even further as it implements the PPP. The Trump Administration should reserve fully half of all the new PPP funds for small businesses with 50 employees or less, so the bigger and more sophisticated aren\u2019t able to win in a first-come, first-served race. We should make sure we serve the mom-and-pop shops , beauty salons, barbershops, diners, local auto body shops. Back on April 3, Joe Biden asked the Trump Administration to \u201cproduce a weekly dashboard to show which small businesses are accessing loans , to make sure that the program isn\u2019t leaving out communities, minority- and women-owned businesses, or the smallest businesses.\u201d They have not done so. It is unacceptable to have a small-business program that is leaving minority business owners out in the cold, or that firms with fewer than 20 employees received only about 20% of the money , even though they make up about one third of payroll. Small non-profits , including churches, mosques, and synagogues , should also be eligible for this fund. The Trump Administration can do this if it makes it a priority. The country will be watching. 2. No Unjust Enrichment: Keep Well-Off Business Owners from Using Any Program to Unjustly Enrich Themselves: Our emergency programs should be designed to keep small business owners and their workers whole during the crisis , not to make well-off business owners better off than they would be with no crisis. Unfortunately, there is a very real risk of high-paid business owners suffering little revenue harm seeking to have loans forgiven that are for more than the losses they have suffered. This is just wrong. Joe Biden would expedite loans with less unnecessary paperwork to hard-hit businesses, and never punish firms or banks for good-faith mistakes. But Biden would also make clear that no business owner should be receiving more than their lost revenue , and that there should be heightened scrutiny of certain types of small businesses , consulting, accounting, legal, tax advice, hedge funds , and where owners and executives are making above $500,000. He is calling on the Trump Administration to embrace this approach in implementing the next round of funding. 3. Make Sure That the Program\u2019s Terms Actually Help Small Businesses. Joe Biden would also support further rule changes to the PPP that would ensure deserving small businesses get all the help they need for as long as they need, including:","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/joe-biden-calls-on-trump-administration-to-ensure-that-relief-funds-get-to-deserving-small-60dce843e474?source=user_profile---------103----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"As Congress reaches a new deal on economic relief measures, including more funds for the Paycheck Protection Program (P) for small businesses, I am grateful to Democratic leaders for securing more funds for hospitals and testing, and more resources for smaller lenders and community-based financial institutions, as well as the depleted Emergency Injury Disaster Loan and Emergency Economic Injury Grant programs.

We have seen Muslims give generously to strengthen our communities and lift up the most marginalized among us. Above all, we have felt the sense of unity, joy, and deep reflection that this month creates for our Muslim friends and neighbors.We know that Ramadan will feel different this year. The global pandemic and public health necessities will mean friends and family cannot come together for nightly iftar dinners, gather for communal prayers in mosques, and organize charitable activities in the community. But we also know that it is ultimately spiritual proximity , and not merely physical proximity , that makes Ramadan meaningful to those who observe. Muslim American community leaders are adapting , convening virtual mosques and hosting online iftars, channeling their charitable efforts toward those hit hardest by this crisis, praying for and honoring the lives of all those who have been lost. Perhaps most remarkably, despite the physical challenges that can come with fasting, Muslims will keep doing what they have been doing before and during this pandemic: leading on the frontlines every day as doctors, nurses, first responders, scientists, small business owners, retail workers, and more.

He murdered one and injured three others before fleeing the scene, with more casualties prevented thanks to the bravery of a congregation member and the weapon jamming.Sadly, the incident was just one in a long and too-rapidly increasing line of attacks targeting communities of faith all across the country. Poway, Pittsburgh, and Monsey, New York, are now part of a tragic shorthand for anti-Semitic violence targeting synagogues and Jewish faith observances , but churches, mosques, Sikh temples, and other houses of worship have seen tragic acts of violence as well: Mother Emanuel in South Carolina, First Baptist Church and West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Minnesota, and many others.Hatred is not a new phenomenon. Nor is it a problem only in the United States. We have recently passed the annual day of remembrance for the victims of the Holocaust, as well as the one-year anniversary of the horrific massacre at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. So it falls to all of us to remain vigilant against these threats, to call out these evils for what they are, and to fight against them at every turn.These are acts of terrorism, plain and simple. They are bound together by the common thread of perpetrators using fear and violence to undermine individuals\u2019 ability to freely exercise their faith. With morbid regularity, these attacks steal lives, destroy families, and wound the communities from which many draw strength. They are an assault on our shared American values of inclusivity, tolerance, and respect.In response to these threats, religious communities have leaned on regional initiatives and member donations to finance enhanced security measures. Federal and state security grants have also helped to improve emergency preparedness and physical security infrastructure. While these are steps in the right direction, more is needed. Religious freedom means the right to practice one\u2019s faith without fear.Addressing gun violence across our nation is a critical part of this, and I have vowed to take the fight to the NRA and the gun manufacturers and to enact a comprehensive plan of gun safety reforms as president. Today, I am also releasing a plan specifically to help safeguard faith-based communities across the United States.These policy proposals are crucial to protecting our faith-based communities against the ugly rise of hate and extremism that has gained encouragement and political cover under the Trump Administration. Anti-Semitism has increased markedly, with hate crimes and anti-Semitic assaults and incidents spiking over the last several years. Government officials are sounding the alarm over a dangerous rise in anti-religious hate speech and conspiracy theories that have taken root in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. It is dangerous, and we need a leader who will send a clear message from the very top of government that hate has no safe harbor in the United States of America. Time and again, Donald Trump has failed to meet that simple test. He has fanned the flames of bigotry and racism for political gain, and made a moral equivalence between those perpetuating hate in our country, and those standing against it.As president, I will fight to restore the soul of this nation and defend our most sacred American values. Freedom of religion was at the heart of the founding of our nation. It is the protection that says each of us is free to live according to our own conscience. During moments of crisis, that freedom is more important than ever.For so many of us, it is our faith that sees us through times of trouble and that urges us to rise each morning and go forth into the world. My faith has given me refuge and resurgence throughout my life. And, with the world struggling now to overcome this pandemic, the ability to practice our respective faiths is a much-needed source of solace for people everywhere. This year, we cannot gather for Ramadan prayers. We could not join together for Passover services or Easter celebrations, or any other religious ceremonies , but we are still united with our communities by our faith. And when we defeat this virus and can gather together once more, we must do everything in our power to assure that we can all celebrate our faith, safely and without fear.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-safeguarding-our-faith-based-communities-14cb72441ebf?source=user_profile---------97----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"One year ago, a gunman armed with an AR-15 style rifle and multiple magazines entered the Chabad of Poway synagogue in California, where members of the Jewish community were gathered to mark Shabbat and celebrate the last day of Passover.

So it falls to all of us to remain vigilant against these threats, to call out these evils for what they are, and to fight against them at every turn.These are acts of terrorism, plain and simple. They are bound together by the common thread of perpetrators using fear and violence to undermine individuals' ability to freely exercise their faith. With morbid regularity, these attacks steal lives, destroy families, and wound the communities from which many draw strength. They are an assault on our shared American values of inclusivity, tolerance, and respect.In response to these threats, religious communities have leaned on regional initiatives and member donations to finance enhanced security measures. Federal and state security grants have also helped to improve emergency preparedness and physical security infrastructure. While these are steps in the right direction, more is needed. Religious freedom means the right to practice one's faith without fear.Addressing gun violence across our nation is a critical part of this, and I have vowed to take the fight to the NRA and the gun manufacturers and to enact a comprehensive plan of gun safety reforms as president. Today, I am also releasing a plan specifically to help safeguard faith-based communities across the United States.These policy proposals are crucial to protecting our faith-based communities against the ugly rise of hate and extremism that has gained encouragement and political cover under the Trump Administration. Anti-Semitism has increased markedly, with hate crimes and anti-Semitic assaults and incidents spiking over the last several years. Government officials are sounding the alarm over a dangerous rise in anti-religious hate speech and conspiracy theories that have taken root in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. It is dangerous, and we need a leader who will send a clear message from the very top of government that hate has no safe harbor in the United States of America. Time and again, Donald Trump has failed to meet that simple test. He has fanned the flames of bigotry and racism for political gain, and made a moral equivalence between those perpetuating hate in our country, and those standing against it.As president, I will fight to restore the soul of this nation and defend our most sacred American values. Freedom of religion was at the heart of the founding of our nation. It is the protection that says each of us is free to live according to our own conscience. During moments of crisis, that freedom is more important than ever.For so many of us, it is our faith that sees us through times of trouble and that urges us to rise each morning and go forth into the world. My faith has given me refuge and resurgence throughout my life. And, with the world struggling now to overcome this pandemic, the ability to practice our respective faiths is a much-needed source of solace for people everywhere. This year, we cannot gather for Ramadan prayers. We could not join together for Passover services or Easter celebrations, or any other religious ceremonies , but we are still united with our communities by our faith. And when we defeat this virus and can gather together once more, we must do everything in our power to assure that we can all celebrate our faith, safely and without fear."}
{"SpeechID":"MEJB274202094","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-04-27","SpeechTitle":"Statement by Vice President Joe Biden and the Biden for President Public Health Advisory Committee on Testing","RawText":"We all agree on the need to reopen the economy and allow some semblance of normalcy as soon as possible. The economic pain and suffering are simply too great to delay unnecessarily. But it is wrong to talk about \u201cchoosing\u201d between our public health and our economy. That\u2019s a false choice. If we don\u2019t beat the virus, we will never get back to full economic strength. And the experience of other nations and past pandemics is teaching us that we have to be prepared for a resurgence of cases that could once again stretch the capacity of our health care system and threaten lives. Public health experts agree there are several keys to safely re-opening the economy and rebuilding the confidence of the American people in their government\u2019s ability to protect them. We need to boost the capacity of our health care system and better protect our health care workers by ramping up the production , and ensuring the fair distribution , of critical equipment like masks and other personal protective equipment, as the Biden for President campaign has repeatedly called for. We need to test and trace contacts of people who have been infected with COVID-19. And we need clear guidance, oversight, and resources for workplaces to keep employees as safe as possible. Are those elements in place? What will it take to put them in place? So far, the United States has conducted 5 million COVID-19 tests for our population of 330 million people. In recent days the number of tests has climbed, but no one who has studied the facts thinks this is sufficient. We are still seeing a massive shortfall and extensive disparities between states in testing , that\u2019s unacceptable. And those failures are in no small part due to the federal government mishandling and delaying the pandemic response. We are now several months into this crisis, and this administration refuses to own up to the original sin of its failed response , the failure to test. Failed leadership, bureaucracy, and a lack of urgency have slowed the testing production process and continue to put us behind nations like Italy, Canada, and Germany in terms of per capita testing. Last week, we marked the deaths of 50,000 people from COVID-19 in the United States , each one a life cut tragically short. Our nation is now the global epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic with more known cases than any other nation in the world. This isn\u2019t rocket science. It just takes investment and execution , both of which have been gravely lacking. Vice President Biden has repeatedly called for President Trump to stand up a Pandemic Testing Board, just as FDR created a War Production Board to massively scale up the production and allocation of equipment and supplies we needed to fight and win World War II. The Board should have members from the public and private sectors , and involve state and local leaders, too. It would oversee a nationwide campaign to provide both diagnostic and antibody tests, which includes surging the production of test kits and lab supplies; coordinating the distribution to every state, tribe, and territory; identifying testing sites and sufficient trained personnel to staff them; ensuring adequate lab capacity and the swift reporting of results; and providing clear guidance on who needs a test. A nationwide campaign has to be well-coordinated and highly agile , able to adjust quickly to accommodate new scientific developments or respond to sudden bottlenecks by evaluating a variety of approaches, from rapid point-of-care tests to in-home sample collection, as Seattle has done. We should better utilize our great university and medical school research laboratories, which spent precious resources equipping their facilities to run COVID-19 tests, yet now sit idle. Let\u2019s harness that capacity to help drastically ramp up our capacity to process these tests And we shouldn\u2019t just test more, we should test smarter. Right now, because of shortages of tests and personnel protective equipment and related challenges, we are still only largely testing the sickest people we suspect have COVID-19, so they can be isolated and cared for. Smart testing would focus on individuals who are at heightened risk, like nursing home residents, as well as those who interact with many people each day, including health care workers, grocery store workers, public safety officials, public transportation employees, and others. Time is not on our side. It is urgent we get these pieces in place and functioning smoothly at full capacity before flu season arrives in the fall, when experts say we could experience a second wave of COVID-19 cases. Testing alone is not enough. We also need Apollo-like moonshots to develop and deploy proven therapeutics and vaccines globally if we are ever to gain the upper hand on this virus. We cannot allow this administration to repeat its failure on testing with therapeutics and vaccines. We must let science , not politicians , lead. We should set the goal of identifying safe, effective therapeutics within 100 days by building on long-standing, proven clinical trial networks , which helped save millions of lives in the fight against AIDS , with a new enduring Emerging Infectious Disease Clinical Trial Network and equipping it with every resource at our disposal. Instead of having different studies competing with each other for resources and patients, this new clinical trial network would bring scientific talent together behind the most promising drugs. And, we should be working now to accelerate a coordinated global approach to develop a safe, effective vaccine and the manufacturing capacity for the doses and related materials like syringes that we will need at home and around the world. The only way to stop COVID-19 here, is to stop it everywhere. In the meantime, however, testing is the springboard we need to help get our economy safely up and running again. Trump could make this happen. He hasn\u2019t. Instead, he\u2019s pushed sole responsibility to governors, while telling them to fly blind without the critical data we derive from testing. If the Biden Administration were in office today, it would have prioritized this testing issue months ago. Since the Trump Administration both can\u2019t and won\u2019t, Congress should step in and establish the Pandemic Testing Board, giving it the authority and funding it needs to succeed. Once we identify COVID-19 infected people, we need to isolate them and identify those to whom they might have unwittingly spread the disease. This is called contact tracing, and our public health professionals do it every day to halt the transmission of infectious diseases already in our midst, including for tuberculosis and measles. To battle a pandemic as large as COVID-19, it will require not just new privacy-protecting technology, but also trained people. Through tough times in our past, generations of Americans have stood up and selflessly answered the call to serve their fellow citizens. We need to harness this spirit of empathy, decency, and unity today and form a new U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps of at least 100,000 people to mobilize Americans across the country, including AmeriCorps and Peace Corps Volunteers and those laid off by the crisis. Massachusetts has already launched its own. The U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps could serve in a variety of important functions, including ensuring contact tracing reaches every underserved community in America , ideally by members of those communities themselves. Already the data shows these communities are being left behind, even as they are suffering the brunt of the pandemic. Perhaps even more importantly, the U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps would become the permanent foundation for a stronger national community public health service that could eventually transition to fight the opioid epidemic and address other national public health priorities. Finally, we need to be working right now on the conditions under which the private sector, industry by industry, can reopen safely. During the H1N1 epidemic, the Obama-Biden Administration tasked the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Centers for Disease Control with issuing detailed guidance for how employers should protect their workers. Then OSHA enforced the law based on those guidelines. And it didn\u2019t stop there. After the epidemic, it spent years preparing for the next one with a comprehensive and specific permanent infectious disease standard that would have required health facilities and certain other high exposure workplaces to permanently implement infection control programs to protect their workers. The Obama-Biden Administration handed this standard to the Trump Administration, but instead of moving it to rulemaking, the Trump Administration shelved it. Today, the Trump Administration is still not driving a serious enforcement effort, putting the health and safety of workers at risk every day. We should immediately double the number of OSHA investigators to enforce the law and existing standards and guidelines, release and enforce an Emergency Temporary Standard to give employers and employees more comprehensive and specific guidance on what to do to reduce the spread of COVID-19, and get to work bringing a permanent standard to conclusion and expanding it to include all relevant workplaces, from manufacturing plants to grocery stores. We want our country to get moving and healthy again. But we must take the necessary, rational steps, grounded in science, to do so safely, so COVID-19 doesn\u2019t come roaring back, shredding our still-fragile health care system and the green shoots of an economic reopening.

Every year, at this time, we talk about awareness, prevention, and the importance of women feeling they can step forward, say something, and be heard. That belief , that women should be heard , was the underpinning of a law I wrote over 25 years ago. To this day, I am most proud of the Violence Against Women Act. So, each April we are reminded not only of how far we have come in dealing with sexual assault in this country , but how far we still have to go.When I wrote the bill, few wanted to talk about the issue. It was considered a private matter, a personal matter, a family matter. I didn\u2019t see it that way. To me, freedom from fear, harm, and violence for women was a legal right, a civil right, and a human right. And I knew we had to change not only the law, but the culture.So, we held hours of hearings and heard from the most incredibly brave women , and we opened the eyes of the Senate and the nation , and passed the law.In the years that followed, I fought to continually strengthen the law. So, when we took office and President Obama asked me what I wanted, I told him I wanted oversight of the critical appointments in the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice and I wanted a senior White House Advisor appointing directly to me on the issue. Both of those things happened.As Vice President, we started the \u201cIt\u2019s on Us\u201d campaign on college campuses to send the message loud and clear that dating violence is violence , and against the law.We had to get men involved. They had to be part of the solution. That\u2019s why I made a point of telling young men this was their problem too , they couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to what was happening around them , they had a responsibility to speak out. Silence is complicity.In the 26 years since the law passed, the culture and perceptions have changed but we\u2019re not done yet.It\u2019s on us, and it\u2019s on me as someone who wants to lead this country. I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished. So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago.They aren\u2019t true. This never happened.While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny.Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways.But this much bears emphasizing.She has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time. They , both men and a woman , have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues. News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one , not one , who corroborated her allegations in any way. Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way , as indeed I would not have.There is a clear, critical part of this story that can be verified. The former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993. But she does not have a record of this alleged complaint. The papers from my Senate years that I donated to the University of Delaware do not contain personnel files. It is the practice of Senators to establish a library of personal papers that document their public record: speeches, policy proposals, positions taken, and the writing of bills.There is only one place a complaint of this kind could be , the National Archives. The National Archives is where the records are kept at what was then called the Office of Fair Employment Practices. I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there.As a Presidential candidate, I\u2019m accountable to the American people. We have lived long enough with a President who doesn\u2019t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That\u2019s not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth.I have spent my career learning from women the ways in which we as individuals and as policy makers need to step up to make their hard jobs easier, with equal pay, equal opportunity, and workplaces and homes free from violence and harassment. I know how critical women\u2019s health issues and basic women\u2019s rights are. That has been a constant through my career, and as President, that work will continue. And I will continue to learn from women, to listen to women, to support women, and yes, to make sure women\u2019s voices are heard.We have a lot of work to do. From confronting online harassment, abuse, and stalking, to ending the rape kit backlog, to addressing the deadly combination of guns and domestic violence.We need to protect and empower the most marginalized communities, including immigrant and indigenous women, trans women, and women of color.We need to make putting an end to gender-based violence in both the United States and around the world a top priority.I started my work over 25 years ago with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB15202092","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-05-01","SpeechTitle":"Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Today\u2019s Unemployment Claims","RawText":"Once more, millions of Americans filed new unemployment claims last week , 3.8 million more individuals off payroll. More than 30 million Americans have now lost their jobs since this pandemic seized our nation. This shocks the conscience of every American. It\u2019s a national economic disaster. The Trump administration\u2019s economic response has been a disaster too. They\u2019ve done exactly what we feared from the beginning: bailed out the wealthy and well-connected while leaving worthy small businesses out in the cold. A publicly-traded real-estate trust that owns a Ritz Carlton got $38 million in the initial round of \u201csmall business\u201d funding. Meanwhile, the Center for Responsible Lending estimates that more than 90 percent of small businesses owned by people of color will get nothing. Outrageous? Yes. Surprising? No. These are the latest damning signs of Donald Trump\u2019s manifest incompetence. Millions upon millions of Americans are suffering economically, there are more than a million confirmed COVID-19 cases nationwide, and we have now lost more American lives to this virus in just a few weeks than we did in all 20 years of the Vietnam War. One of the hardest parts of this tragedy is knowing beyond a doubt that it didn\u2019t have to be this way. The lack of preparation, the slow response on testing, the failure to administer the relief in the CARES Act appropriately , all of it stems from Donald Trump\u2019s failures as president. This week we learned that the intelligence community sent warning after warning to Trump in the President\u2019s Daily Brief , more than a dozen red-alarms in the vital months of January and February.

More than 30 million Americans have now lost their jobs since this pandemic seized our nation. This shocks the conscience of every American. It's a national economic disaster. The Trump administration's economic response has been a disaster too. They've done exactly what we feared from the beginning: bailed out the wealthy and well-connected while leaving worthy small businesses out in the cold. A publicly-traded real-estate trust that owns a Ritz Carlton got $38 million in the initial round of 'small business' funding. Meanwhile, the Center for Responsible Lending estimates that more than 90 percent of small businesses owned by people of color will get nothing. Outrageous? Yes. Surprising? No. These are the latest damning signs of Donald Trump's manifest incompetence. Millions upon millions of Americans are suffering economically, there are more than a million confirmed COVID-19 cases nationwide, and we have now lost more American lives to this virus in just a few weeks than we did in all 20 years of the Vietnam War. One of the hardest parts of this tragedy is knowing beyond a doubt that it didn't have to be this way. The lack of preparation, the slow response on testing, the failure to administer the relief in the CARES Act appropriately , all of it stems from Donald Trump's failures as president. This week we learned that the intelligence community sent warning after warning to Trump in the President's Daily Brief , more than a dozen red-alarms in the vital months of January and February. That's the pace of alarm often used for an imminent terrorist attack. So either Trump didn't read his PDB, which is inexcusable, or worse, he knew this was a threat and he made a conscious choice to ignore the warnings, downplay the threat, and endanger thousands of American lives and millions of jobs.

While I was there, I had a chance to stand on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel where Dr. King was assassinated half a century earlier, and reflect on all of the progress we\u2019d made , and that which we hadn\u2019t , in the years since that unbearable day.The motel balcony leads back into Dr. King\u2019s room , a room preserved just as it was on the night he was taken from us. The bed is unmade. Coffee cups are scattered on the table. There is a restless spirit in that room , of a dream deferred; of unfinished business.The night before Dr. King was assassinated, he stood at the pulpit at Mason Temple and delivered what turned out to be his final sermon , a call to support sanitation workers who were striking for better pay. He commanded the congregation: \u201cLet us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge, to make America what it ought to be.\u201dFifty-two years later, his charge remains as vital as it was that night. We have made extraordinary strides along so many fronts , but for African American families, we have not yet made America what it ought to be. The truth is, African Americans can never have a fair shot at the American Dream so long as entrenched disparities are still allowed to chip away at opportunity. You don\u2019t have an equal chance when your schools are substandard, when your home is undervalued, when your car insurance costs more for no good reason, or when the poverty rate for African Americans is more than twice what it is for whites.I believe that the moral obligation of our time is to rebuild our economy in a way that finally brings everyone along. That goal has always been the core of my candidacy , it\u2019s the very reason that I am running for President. And achieving it starts by rooting out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, our institutions, and our hearts.This mission is more urgent now than ever before, as the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 have exposed , and cruelly exacerbated , the disparities long faced by African Americans. In April, I called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect more data that would shed light on how COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting communities, including breaking down its impacts by race. The data we\u2019ve seen so far suggests that African Americans are dying from COVID-19 at a far higher rate than whites. African Americans represent an especially high percentage of the front-line workers putting themselves at greater risk to sustain the economy and keep the rest of the country safe and fed , and are less likely to have a job they can do from home, forcing them to make the difficult choice between their health and a paycheck. Long-standing systemic inequalities may also be contributing to this disparity , including the fact that African Americans are more likely to be uninsured. While there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t yet know about COVID-19, we do know that equitable distribution of resources , like testing and medical equipment , can make a difference in fighting the virus. We must make that a priority and take action now.The virus is also having a disproportionate economic impact on African American families. African American small businesses have been hit hard, and over 90% of African American-owned businesses are estimated to be shut out of the initial relief program due to preexisting, systemic disparities in lending. This is especially dire given that African American families have less of a financial cushion to fall back on in hard times. Since the onset of this crisis, I have been calling for the nation\u2019s relief and recovery efforts to be equitable and just, including by designing relief programs in ways that steer clear of methods we know lead to disparate outcomes , so that funds can actually reach African American families, communities, and small businesses. Unfortunately, Donald Trump has failed to listen or act. If I were President today, I would make it a top priority to ensure that African American workers, families, and small businesses got the relief they need and deserve.This is not a new priority for me , tackling systemic racism and fighting for civil rights is what brought me to public service as a local councilman in the years just after Dr. King\u2019s death, and it has been a driving force throughout my career ever since. I was proud to fight against discriminatory school district funding and housing practices in my own community as a young man , and prouder still of the work I did in the U.S. Senate, co-sponsoring the Civil Rights Act of 1990 to protect against employment discrimination, leading efforts to reauthorize and extend the Fair Housing Act, and spearheading multiple reauthorizations of the Voting Rights Act to protect African Americans\u2019 right to vote.This moment demands an overwhelming moral response. We need a comprehensive agenda for African Americans , a plan with the ambition to match the scale of the challenge, and one that recognizes that race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities.Today, I\u2019m releasing a new plan to achieve equity for the African American community and take us one step closer to making America what it ought to be. The six pillars of my plan are as follows:This plan will tackle some of the most stubborn and pervasive issues , including those that often go unnoticed , that hold back African Americans from receiving an equal shot.African American entrepreneurs seeking capital are rejected at a rate nearly 20 percent higher than white entrepreneurs, and receive far less support when they do get funding. We\u2019re going to fix that by doubling the State Small Business Credit Initiative, doubling funding for a program that supports mission-driven lenders in low-income communities, expanding the New Markets Tax Credit to draw tens of billions of dollars to invest in communities that need it, and shoring up the Small Business Administration\u2019s budget and expanding the agency\u2019s programs that have proven most effective at helping African American-owned businesses get off the ground.The first installment of the Paycheck Protection Program created in response to COVID-19 largely left out minority-owned businesses. We\u2019re going to fix that by providing entrepreneurs with technical assistance and legal and accounting support to ensure that they can apply for funding, producing a weekly dashboard to track exactly which businesses are receiving economic relief, and reserving half of all new relief funds for small businesses with 50 or fewer employees , a category that includes 98 percent of all minority- and women-owned businesses.The gap between African American and white homeownership is larger today than it was when the Fair Housing Act was first passed in 1968 , a key contributor to the unacceptable racial wealth gap that persists between American households. We\u2019re going to fix that by investing $640 billion over ten years to ensure that every American has access to housing that is affordable and accessible, stable and safe, energy-efficient, and located near good schools. We\u2019ll create a tax credit of up to $15,000 for first-time homebuyers available at the moment they make their purchase, establish a new homeowners\u2019 and renters\u2019 bill of rights to bar deceptive and discriminatory practices and bring more accountability and oversight to mortgage brokers and landlords, end discrimination in credit reporting by creating a new public credit reporting agency to catch and eliminate racial disparities, and establish national standards for housing appraisals to put an end to the undervaluing of homes in African American neighborhoods.The typical African American family holds about one-tenth the wealth of a typical white family , and the disparity has grown worse, not better, over the last fifty years. We\u2019re going to fix that by implementing Congressman Jim Clyburn\u2019s \u201c10\u201320\u201330\u201d Plan to ensure that federal programs are reaching persistently impoverished communities, and targeting new green infrastructure projects , and the good-paying jobs that come with them , to historically marginalized neighborhoods. In conjunction with that work, we\u2019ll expand on the Obama-Biden Administration\u2019s efforts to increase federal and state contracting opportunities for African American-owned businesses , including by increasing funds for the Minority Business Development Agency and expanding the work of its landmark Federal Procurement Center. We\u2019ll also close the digital divide by investing $20 billion in broadband infrastructure to reach underserved communities and passing the Digital Equity Act. And we\u2019ll make it easier for African Americans to retire with dignity by revamping employer retirement plans and putting them within reach of far more workers , and by making Social Security benefits more generous and equitable.For too long, African Americans have not been adequately dealt into the middle class. We\u2019re going to fix that by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act and ending unequal pay, getting our essential workers the pay, protections, and dignity they deserve, strengthening public and private sector unions, and raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. We\u2019ll provide high-quality, universal pre-K for every three- and four-year old in America, so that every child gets off to a good start , and close the funding gap between white and non-white school districts to ensure that African American families can thrive across generations. We\u2019ll tackle the student debt crisis , which disproportionately burdens African Americans , make public colleges and universities tuition-free for families with incomes below $125,000, and invest more than $70 billion in HBCUs and minority-serving institutions to equip the next generation of African American professionals to succeed.There is much, much more to my plan , after all, the roots of inequity are sprawling, and touch nearly every corner of American policy and society. We need to take serious steps to reduce racial health disparities, and we need to put an end to forces that profit off of our criminal justice system. We need to restore the Voting Rights Act, and we need to ensure that every community has access to safe drinking water. Building a more equitable nation will require a broad and coordinated push across the full scope of our government and society , but it can, and must, be done.I encourage you to read the full details of my plan here. And I look forward to making it a reality with the help of lawmakers, community leaders, and families across the country who aspire to the dream of Dr. King. In his words: \u201cLet us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge, to make America what it ought to be.\u201d","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/lift-every-voice-the-biden-plan-for-black-america-d546228da188?source=user_profile---------93----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Among the greatest honors of my life was a trip I took to Memphis in October of 2018 to visit the National Civil Rights Museum and receive the institution's annual Freedom Award.

As a result of the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis , made worse by President Trump\u2019s failure to act , it is projected that one in six American households will experience food insecurity by the end of this year. Americans are lined up at food banks across the country. At the same time, producers have to dump food that used to go to restaurants, schools, and other big food purchasers, and restaurants are shuttered and laying off workers across the country. The FEED Act is a critical step to address the hunger crisis.Hunger today isn\u2019t about scarcity , it\u2019s about a massive failure in leadership. This moment demands an effective leader who can implement bold solutions, instead of providing false choices. A leader who will harness the restaurant industry to help get food to those who need it, and help get millions of laid-off workers back on the job. Who will bolster food assistance to stimulate the economy. And, who will ensure farmers can get their food to plates and also protect the workers that are essential links in the supply chain.Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s is filling this leadership hole created by the White House and, through his non-profit the World Central Kitchen, solving this problem in communities across the country. The Chef\u2019s innovative approach pays restaurants to prepare meals for hungry individuals. This allows restaurants to hire back their employees, keep buying food from producers who would have no other purchaser if restaurants were shuttered, and ensure that people across the country have nutritious food to eat.With a partner in the White House, this strategy can be scaled up nationally. The bipartisan FEMA Empowering Essential Deliveries (FEED) Act would temporarily allow the federal government to pay restaurants to prepare meals for the hungry without requiring cash-strapped states to provide any matching dollars.This proposal builds on Vice President Biden\u2019s call for the Trump Administration to support proposals to strengthen food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and ensure access to more nutritious offerings. If Biden was President today, he would increase SNAP benefits by 15% during the deepening recession, and temporarily provide low-income families with about $100 per month in extra nutritional support.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/joe-biden-urges-donald-trump-to-address-hunger-crisis-655009f4f39f?source=user_profile---------79----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Following yesterday's town hall with Chef Jos\ufffd Andr\ufffds, Vice President Biden is calling on President Trump to work with Congress to enact the bipartisan FEMA Empowering Essential Deliveries (FEED) Act.

The Treaty was negotiated and signed under President George H.W. Bush to build confidence and increase transparency in the Euro-Atlantic region.

That has remained true for the nearly two decades the treaty has been in force. During the Obama Administration, the United States and our partners successfully used Open Skies flights and imagery to support Ukraine when Russia violated its territory, disprove Russian disinformation, and show the world what Russia was doing. The Trump Administration says it is withdrawing from the Treaty because Russia is cheating. There are real concerns that Russia is not complying fully with the Treaty. It has improperly imposed restrictions on overflights over certain regions (Kaliningrad and the Russian-occupied regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia), to which the United States and other parties have objected.

This is just the latest evidence of Donald Trump\u2019s utter failure to do what a president should and must do: lead in a crisis. He ignored the warnings, refused to prepare the country, and wasn\u2019t honest with the American people about what was needed , and we are all living with the horrific results. Now, nearly a quarter of the American workforce has filed for unemployment , a figure so staggering that it would have seemed unthinkable not long ago.Though the coronavirus is to blame for planting the seeds of this damage, we know that Donald Trump\u2019s persistent failure to act is responsible for the tragic and unprecedented scale of the crisis. Trump was warned for months about the urgency of the situation, but sat on his hands , undermining public health experts and spinning false promises to the American people to prop up his political standing at the expense of public safety.Germany, by contrast, had its first reported case of coronavirus almost a week after the United States, but has suffered only a tiny fraction of the unemployment we\u2019ve faced thanks to a swift and effective public health response. Millions more Americans would be employed today , and our lives would have a far greater semblance of normalcy , had Trump responded with similar resolve. A devastating study released last week found that 36,000 people could have been saved had Trump taken action even one week earlier. Instead, more than 100,000 Americans have been lost forever, and the day-to-day lives and future dreams of 40 million people and their families have been thrown off course.Even now, Trump refuses to focus on getting help to those who need it most. The largest single recipient of relief funds intended for small businesses was a hotel executive and major Trump donor who claimed more than $58 million in taxpayer bailout money. A private jet company founded by a Trump donor received another $27 million. And a cell phone location-tracking company that has been hired by the Trump campaign to target voters obtained nearly $3 million.Meanwhile, actual small businesses and mom-and-pop entrepreneurs , the lifeblood of local economies , are being turned away in droves. As if that weren\u2019t enough, Trump has also used the cover of this crisis to brazenly fire five inspectors general, the public watchdogs whose job it is to guard against corruption , including the official responsible for providing oversight of pandemic relief funds.The corruption is obvious , the incompetence even more so. Two months after Congress passed the CARES Act to speed relief to the American people, not one dollar allocated for the Main Street Lending Program , a $600 billion fund designed to help small and medium-sized businesses across America , has been disbursed. Not one dollar, as businesses keep laying workers off and struggle through some of the most brutal months in modern history. Wall Street has gotten the help it needs; Main Street is still waiting. There is no excuse for this Administration\u2019s lack of urgency or care given all that the American people are enduring right now.I oversaw implementation of the nearly $800 billion Recovery Act , with less than 0.2 percent waste, fraud, and abuse. That response didn\u2019t happen by magic. It took sustained focus and constant pressure and personal engagement at the highest levels to make sure we were implementing the program efficiently and effectively on behalf of the American people. We need that type of response right now , albeit on a dramatically larger scale.Donald Trump should be laser-focused on getting relief out as fast as possible to the people who actually need it , with no favoritism and no fraud.

It denied his very humanity. It denied him of his life. Depriving George Floyd , as it deprived Eric Garner , of the one thing every human being must be able to do: Breathe. So simple. So basic. So brutal.The same thing happened with Ahmaud Arbery. The same with Breonna Taylor. The same thing with George Floyd.We\u2019ve spoken their names aloud. Cried them out in pain and horror. Chiseled them into long suffering hearts. They are the latest additions to an endless list of lives stolen , potential wiped out unnecessarily. It\u2019s a list that dates back more than 400 years: black men, black women, black children. The original sin of this country still stains our nation today.Sometimes we manage to overlook it, and just push forward with the thousand other tasks of daily life. But it\u2019s always there. And weeks like this, we see it plainly. We are a country with an open wound. None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words , \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d , and do nothing. We cannot fall victim to what Martin Luther King called the \u201cappalling silence of the good people.\u201d Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering , who will be next? Imagine if every time your husband or son, wife or daughter, left the house, you feared for their safety from bad actors and bad police. Imagine if you had to have that talk with your child about not asserting their rights , and taking the abuse handed out to them , just so they could make it home. Imagine having the police called on you , for just sitting in Starbucks or renting an Airbnb or watching birds. That is the norm for black people in this nation , they don\u2019t have to imagine it.The anger and the frustration and the exhaustion , it\u2019s undeniable. But that is not the promise of America. And it is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all people.This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now.Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism.

It denied his very humanity. It denied him of his life. Depriving George Floyd , as it deprived Eric Garner , of the one thing every human being must be able to do: Breathe. So simple. So basic. So brutal.The same thing happened with Ahmaud Arbery. The same with Breonna Taylor. The same thing with George Floyd.We've spoken their names aloud. Cried them out in pain and horror. Chiseled them into long suffering hearts. They are the latest additions to an endless list of lives stolen , potential wiped out unnecessarily. It's a list that dates back more than 400 years: black men, black women, black children. The original sin of this country still stains our nation today.Sometimes we manage to overlook it, and just push forward with the thousand other tasks of daily life. But it's always there. And weeks like this, we see it plainly. We are a country with an open wound. None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words , 'I can't breathe' , and do nothing. We cannot fall victim to what Martin Luther King called the 'appalling silence of the good people.' Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering , who will be next? Imagine if every time your husband or son, wife or daughter, left the house, you feared for their safety from bad actors and bad police. Imagine if you had to have that talk with your child about not asserting their rights , and taking the abuse handed out to them , just so they could make it home. Imagine having the police called on you , for just sitting in Starbucks or renting an Airbnb or watching birds. That is the norm for black people in this nation , they don't have to imagine it.The anger and the frustration and the exhaustion , it's undeniable. But that is not the promise of America. And it is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all people.This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now.Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism. It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation. We need justice for George Floyd. We need real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet , that holds bad cops accountable, and that repairs the relationship between law enforcement and the community they are sworn to protect.

But they didn\u2019t die with him. They\u2019re still being heard. They\u2019re echoing across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often just the color of your skin puts your life at risk. They speak to a nation where more than 100,000 people have lost their lives to a virus , and 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment , with a disproportionate number of these deaths and job losses concentrated in black and brown communities. And they speak to a nation where every day millions of people , not at the moment of losing their life , but in the course of living their life , are saying to themselves, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d It\u2019s a wake-up call for our nation. For all of us. And I mean all of us. It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve heard these words , they\u2019re the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken six years ago. But it\u2019s time to listen to these words. Understand them. And respond to them , with real action. The country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us. Leadership that can bring us together. Leadership that can recognize the pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for too long. But there is no place for violence. No place for looting or destroying property or burning churches, or destroying businesses , many of them built by people of color who for the first time were beginning to realize their dreams and build wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for our police , sworn to protect and serve all people , to escalate tensions or resort to excessive violence. We need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protest , and opportunistic violent destruction.And we must be vigilant about the violence that\u2019s being done by the incumbent president to our democracy and to the pursuit of justice. When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the President from the doorstep of the people\u2019s house, the White House , using tear gas and flash grenades , in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle. More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that\u2019s what the presidency is: a duty of care , to all of us, not just our voters, not just our donors, but all of us. The President held up a bible at St. John\u2019s church yesterday.If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something: That we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. That\u2019s hard work. But it\u2019s the work of America. Donald Trump isn\u2019t interested in doing that work.Instead he\u2019s preening and sweeping away all the guardrails that have long protected our democracy. Guardrails that have helped make possible this nation\u2019s path to a more perfect union. A union that constantly requires reform and rededication , and yes the protests from voices of those mistreated, ignored, left out and left behind. But it\u2019s a union worth fighting for and that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for President. In addition to the Bible, he might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he\u2019d find the First Amendment. It protects \u201cthe right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\u201d Mr. President: That is America. Not horses rising up on their hind legs to push back a peaceful protest. Not using the American military to move against the American people. This nation is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is the cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. We will not allow any President to quiet our voice. We won\u2019t let those who see this as an opportunity to sow chaos throw up a smokescreen to distract us from the very real and legitimate grievances at the heart of these protests.And we can\u2019t leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away and do nothing. We can\u2019t. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism. To deal with the growing economic inequality in our nation. And to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation , to so many. I\u2019ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important , who we want to be. It\u2019s all at stake. That is truer today than ever. And it\u2019s in this urgency we can find the path forward. The history of this nation teaches us that it\u2019s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we\u2019ve made some of our greatest progress. The 13th and 14th and 15th Amendments followed the Civil War. The greatest economy in the history of the world grew out of the Great Depression. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 came in the tracks of Bull Connor\u2019s vicious dogs. To paraphrase Reverend Barber , it\u2019s in the mourning we find hope.It will take more than talk. We\u2019ve had talk before. We\u2019ve had protests before.Let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes. That action will not be completed in the first 100 days of my Presidency , or even an entire term. It is the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the first 100 days of my Presidency to get started. A down payment on what is long overdue should come now. Immediately. I call on Congress to act this month on measures that would be a first step in this direction. Starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw choke holds. Congress should put it on President Trump\u2019s desk in the next few days. There are other measures: to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces, to improve oversight and accountability, to create a model use of force standard , that also should be made law this month. No more excuses. No more delays. If the Senate has time to confirm Trump\u2019s unqualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our Constitution, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution\u2019s promise of \u201cequal protection of the laws.\u201d Looking ahead, in the first 100 days of my presidency, I have committed to creating a national police oversight commission. I\u2019ve long believed we need real community policing. And we need each and every police department in the country to undertake a comprehensive review of their hiring, their training, and their de-escalation practices. And the federal government should give them the tools and resources they need to implement reforms. Most cops meet the highest standards of their profession. All the more reason that bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture that allows for these senseless tragedies to keep happening. And we need to learn from the cities and precincts that are getting it right. We know, though, that to have true justice in America, we need economic justice, too. Here, too, there is much to be done.As an immediate step, Congress should act to rectify racial inequities in the allocation of COVID-19 recovery funds. I will be setting forth more of my agenda on economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. It should be a right not a privilege. The quickest route to universal coverage in this country is to expand Obamacare. We could do it. We should do it. But this president , even now , in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment wants to destroy it. He doesn\u2019t care how many millions of Americans will be hurt , because he is consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to President Obama. The President should withdraw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to act on my proposal to expand Obamacare to millions more. These last few months we have seen America\u2019s true heroes. The health care workers, the nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers.We have a new phrase for them: Essential workers. But we need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. Because if it wasn\u2019t clear before, it\u2019s clear now. This country wasn\u2019t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs. It was built by America\u2019s great middle class , by our essential workers. I know there is enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. And I know so many Americans are suffering. Suffering the loss of a loved one. Suffering economic hardships. Suffering under the weight of generation after generation after generation of hurt inflicted on people of color , and on black and Native communities in particular. I know what it means to grieve. My losses are not the same as the losses felt by so many. But I know what it is to feel like you cannot go on. I know what it means to have a black hole of grief sucking at your chest. Just a few days ago marked the fifth anniversary of my son Beau\u2019s passing from cancer. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different from the day he died. But I also know that the best way to bear loss and pain is to turn all that anger and anguish to purpose. And, Americans know what our purpose is as a nation. It has guided us from the very beginning. It\u2019s been reported. That on the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated, little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her father\u2019s arms. \u201cOh, Daddy,\u201d she said, \u201cnow we will never get our freedom.\u201d Her daddy was reassuring, strong, and brave. \u201cNow don\u2019t you worry, baby,\u201d said Martin Luther King, Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d Amid violence and fear, Dr. King persevered.He was driven by his dream of a nation where \u201cjustice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.\u201d Then, in 1968 hate would cut him down in Memphis. A few days before Dr. King was murdered, he gave a final Sunday sermon in Washington. He told us that though the arc of a moral universe is long, it bends toward justice. And we know we can bend it , because we have. We have to believe that still. That is our purpose. It\u2019s been our purpose from the beginning.To become the nation where all men and women are not only created equal , but treated equally. To become the nation defined , in Dr. King\u2019s words , not only by the absence of tension, but by the presence of justice. Today in America it\u2019s hard to keep faith that justice is at hand. I know that. You know that. The pain is raw. The pain is real. A president of the United States must be part of the solution, not the problem. But our president today is part of the problem. When he tweeted the words \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d , those weren\u2019t the words of a president. They were the words of a racist Miami police chief from the 1960s. When he tweeted that protesters \u201cwould have been greeted with the most vicious dogs that\u2019s when people would have been really badly hurt.\u201d Those weren\u2019t the words of a president , those were the kind of words a Bull Connor would have used unleashing his dogs. The American story is about action and reaction. That\u2019s the way history works. We can\u2019t be na\u00efve about that. I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn\u2019t and it won\u2019t. American history isn\u2019t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull for more than 240 years. A tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is both elementsare part of the American character. At our best, the American ideal wins out. It\u2019s never a rout. It\u2019s always a fight. And the battle is never finally won. But we can\u2019t ignore the truth that we are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists. Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation\u2019s well-being he leads. I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids\u2019 and grandkids\u2019 lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know we can be. The America we know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, the presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won\u2019t either. But I promise you this. I won\u2019t traffic in fear and division. I won\u2019t fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country , not use them for political gain. I\u2019ll do my job and take responsibility. I won\u2019t blame others. I\u2019ll never forget that the job isn\u2019t about me. It\u2019s about you. And I\u2019ll work to not only rebuild this nation. But to build it better than it was. To build a better future. That\u2019s what America does. We build the future. It may in fact be the most American thing to do. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote the way Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis did. We strive to explore the stars, to cure disease, to make this imperfect Union as perfect as we can. We may come up short , but at our best we try. We are facing formidable enemies. They include not only the coronavirus and its terrible impact on our lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty , and that duty includes remembering who we should be.We should be the America of FDR and Eisenhower, of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., of Jonas Salk and Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life and liberty and courage. Above all, we should be the America that cherishes each other , each and every one. We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us. As President, it is my commitment to all of you to lead on these issues , to listen. Because I truly believe in my heart of hearts, that we can overcome. And when we stand together, finally, as One America, we will rise stronger than before. So reach out to one another. Speak out for one another. And please, please take care of each other. This is the United States of America. And there is nothing we can\u2019t do. If we do it together.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-vice-president-joe-biden-in-philadelphia-pennsylvania-a6c550d42bb9?source=user_profile---------69----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"'I can't breathe.'

And to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation , to so many. I've said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important , who we want to be. It's all at stake. That is truer today than ever. And it's in this urgency we can find the path forward. The history of this nation teaches us that it's in some of our darkest moments of despair that we've made some of our greatest progress. The 13th and 14th and 15th Amendments followed the Civil War. The greatest economy in the history of the world grew out of the Great Depression. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. To paraphrase Reverend Barber , it's in the mourning we find hope.It will take more than talk. We've had talk before. We've had protests before.Let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes. That action will not be completed in the first 100 days of my Presidency , or even an entire term. It is the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the first 100 days of my Presidency to get started. A down payment on what is long overdue should come now. Immediately. I call on Congress to act this month on measures that would be a first step in this direction. Starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw choke holds. Congress should put it on President Trump's desk in the next few days. There are other measures: to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces, to improve oversight and accountability, to create a model use of force standard , that also should be made law this month. No more excuses. No more delays. If the Senate has time to confirm Trump's unqualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our Constitution, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution's promise of 'equal protection of the laws.' Looking ahead, in the first 100 days of my presidency, I have committed to creating a national police oversight commission. I've long believed we need real community policing. And we need each and every police department in the country to undertake a comprehensive review of their hiring, their training, and their de-escalation practices. And the federal government should give them the tools and resources they need to implement reforms. Most cops meet the highest standards of their profession. All the more reason that bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture that allows for these senseless tragedies to keep happening. And we need to learn from the cities and precincts that are getting it right. We know, though, that to have true justice in America, we need economic justice, too. Here, too, there is much to be done.As an immediate step, Congress should act to rectify racial inequities in the allocation of COVID-19 recovery funds. I will be setting forth more of my agenda on economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. It should be a right not a privilege. The quickest route to universal coverage in this country is to expand Obamacare. We could do it. We should do it. But this president , even now , in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment wants to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions of Americans will be hurt , because he is consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to President Obama. The President should withdraw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to act on my proposal to expand Obamacare to millions more. These last few months we have seen America's true heroes. The health care workers, the nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers.We have a new phrase for them: Essential workers. But we need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. Because if it wasn't clear before, it's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs. It was built by America's great middle class , by our essential workers. I know there is enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. And I know so many Americans are suffering. Suffering the loss of a loved one. Suffering economic hardships. Suffering under the weight of generation after generation after generation of hurt inflicted on people of color , and on black and Native communities in particular. I know what it means to grieve. My losses are not the same as the losses felt by so many. But I know what it is to feel like you cannot go on. I know what it means to have a black hole of grief sucking at your chest. Just a few days ago marked the fifth anniversary of my son Beau's passing from cancer. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different from the day he died. But I also know that the best way to bear loss and pain is to turn all that anger and anguish to purpose. And, Americans know what our purpose is as a nation. It has guided us from the very beginning. It's been reported. That on the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated, little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her father's arms. 'Oh, Daddy,' she said, 'now we will never get our freedom.' Her daddy was reassuring, strong, and brave. 'Now don't you worry, baby,' said Martin Luther King, Jr. 'It's going to be all right.' Amid violence and fear, Dr. King persevered.He was driven by his dream of a nation where 'justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.' Then, in 1968 hate would cut him down in Memphis. A few days before Dr. King was murdered, he gave a final Sunday sermon in Washington. He told us that though the arc of a moral universe is long, it bends toward justice. And we know we can bend it , because we have. We have to believe that still. That is our purpose. It's been our purpose from the beginning.To become the nation where all men and women are not only created equal , but treated equally. To become the nation defined , in Dr. King's words , not only by the absence of tension, but by the presence of justice. Today in America it's hard to keep faith that justice is at hand. I know that. You know that. The pain is raw. The pain is real. A president of the United States must be part of the solution, not the problem. But our president today is part of the problem. When he tweeted the words 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts' , those weren't the words of a president. They were the words of a racist Miami police chief from the 1960s. When he tweeted that protesters 'would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs that's when people would have been really badly hurt.' Those weren't the words of a president , those were the kind of words a Bull Connor would have used unleashing his dogs. The American story is about action and reaction. That's the way history works. We can't be na\ufffdve about that. I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn't and it won't. American history isn't a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull for more than 240 years. A tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is both elementsare part of the American character. At our best, the American ideal wins out. It's never a rout. It's always a fight. And the battle is never finally won. But we can't ignore the truth that we are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists. Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being he leads. I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids' and grandkids' lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know we can be. The America we know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, the presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country , not use them for political gain. I'll do my job and take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget that the job isn't about me. It's about you. And I'll work to not only rebuild this nation. But to build it better than it was. To build a better future. That's what America does. We build the future. It may in fact be the most American thing to do. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote the way Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis did. We strive to explore the stars, to cure disease, to make this imperfect Union as perfect as we can. We may come up short , but at our best we try. We are facing formidable enemies. They include not only the coronavirus and its terrible impact on our lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty , and that duty includes remembering who we should be.We should be the America of FDR and Eisenhower, of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., of Jonas Salk and Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life and liberty and courage. Above all, we should be the America that cherishes each other , each and every one. We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us. As President, it is my commitment to all of you to lead on these issues , to listen. Because I truly believe in my heart of hearts, that we can overcome. And when we stand together, finally, as One America, we will rise stronger than before. So reach out to one another. Speak out for one another. And please, please take care of each other. This is the United States of America. And there is nothing we can't do. If we do it together."}

{"SpeechID":"MEJB56202063","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-06-05","SpeechTitle":"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President Joe Biden on the Economy and Jobs Report in Dover, Delaware","RawText":"Good afternoon.Before I speak to the economic situation, I have to take a moment to address something the President said this morning.Toward the end of his remarks today, Donald Trump said he hopes that George Floyd \u201cis looking down and seeing this is a great day for our country.\u201dHe was speaking of a man who was brutally killed by an act of needless violence , and by a larger tide of injustice , that has metastasized on this President\u2019s watch.George Floyd\u2019s last words , \u201cI can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe\u201d , have echoed across our nation.For the President to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd , is frankly despicable.And, the fact that he did so on a day when Black unemployment rose and black youth unemployment skyrocketed , tells you everything you need to know about who this man is and what he cares about.Today, like all Americans, I was glad to see that two-and-a-half million Americans have gotten their jobs back.For those families, that\u2019s a sigh of relief.And for all of us, it\u2019s a reminder of the resilience of the American people.To those Americans, I\u2019m so proud of you, and so happy for you and your families.I was disturbed, however, to see the President crowing this morning , basically hanging a\u201cmission accomplished\u201d\u2019 banner when there is so much work to be done , and so many Americans are still hurting.More than twenty million Americans , one out of every seven U.S. workers , are still out of work.For an enormous swath of our country, their dreams are still on hold. They are still struggling to put food on the table. The unemployment rate remains the highest it\u2019s been in nearly a century.As I said, Black unemployment went up this month. Latino youth unemployment jumped to over 37 percent. Hispanic unemployment overall is four times higher than it was before the President botched his response to the pandemic. And I\u2019m worried, when you look deeper at the data, that while temporary layoffs went down,permanent layoffs went up.Donald Trump still doesn\u2019t get it.He\u2019s out there spiking the football , completely oblivious to the tens of millions of people who are facing the greatest struggle of their lives. Those folks aren\u2019t feeling any less pain today than they were yesterday.People who\u2019ve lost their health care in this crisis, they\u2019re not celebrating today , especially when Donald Trump is still in court fighting to strip away health care protections from even more Americans.The fact is, there are about 13 million less jobs today for American workers than the day that President Obama and I left office.So while it\u2019s wonderful to see ten percent of the families who lost their jobs due to Trump\u2019s disastrous pandemic response start to make their way back , the President\u2019s behavior makes me deeply worried for the 90 percent who haven\u2019t.So to all those families , who are scared, and hurting, and wondering what\u2019s going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I won\u2019t ever forget you. And I won\u2019t be satisfied , until this economy starts working for all of you.Let\u2019s be clear about something. The depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of God , but to the failure of a President. The truth is every country dealt with job losses due to the pandemic, but America was hit much harder out of the gate due to Trump\u2019s complete mismanagement of the response.This morning, he tried to compare our response to Germany\u2019s and South Korea\u2019s.Okay, let\u2019s compare. Germany has one-third of the deaths per capita that we do. South Korea has less than 300 deaths , total. America has four percent of the world\u2019s population , and more than a quarter of the world\u2019s deaths from this pandemic.It\u2019s no secret why that is.Let\u2019s get something straight: he did not act quickly.For months, he downplayed the threat , falsely promising us that anyone could get a test , and claiming that \u201clike a miracle it will disappear.\u201dHe repeatedly praised China\u2019s containment response , despite a litany of public appeals , including from me , not to bet American lives and the U.S. economy on the word of the Chinese government.He refused to take action to get adequate testing in place , allowing the virus to spread further than it should have.Columbia University found that 54,000 lives could have been saved if the administration had acted just two weeks earlier.His failure didn\u2019t just cost lives. It cost jobs.New studies this week from Moody\u2019s and Brookings confirm that half or more of those who lost their jobs would still be employed had Trump mounted a competent response like Germany and South Korea and other countries did.We know why this happened. Donald Trump was more focused on the stock wealth of the biggest corporations than he was on the well-being of the American people.It\u2019s why he had his top economic advisors telling people to buy stocks instead of preparing our nation to brace for the pandemic.Now , after 110,000 deaths and more than 20 million people still out of work , the consequences are clear.We are still facing devastating unemployment, an historic health crisis, and a continuing crisisof violence, injustice, and indignity that is devastating Black Americans and diminishing the soul of our country.These are some of the sternest challenges our nation has ever faced, and Trump is patting himself on the back.He just has no idea what\u2019s really going on in this country. He has no idea the depth of pain that people are facing. He remains completely oblivious to the human toll of his indifference. It is time for him to step out of his bunker and take a look around at the consequences of his words and actions.Let\u2019s be clear , a president who takes no responsibility for costing millions and millions of Americans their jobs deserves no credit when a fraction of them return.But there\u2019s a deeper concern here. As we recover, some of the temporary job losses we are still not on track to grow back in a way that will actually serve working people.President Trump is still rewarding wealth over work.All we hear coming out of the White House is calls for more tax cuts for big investors and big corporations. Well, they didn\u2019t build this country. The middle class did , that\u2019s who I fight for.And if Trump continues to put the interests of CEOs and shareholders ahead of American workers, we\u2019ll never get to where we need to be as a country.Look, every American has a choice to make this November. Not simply what kind of President we want , but what kind of country we want. What kind of economy we want , and who that economy serves.In the coming weeks, I will lay out in detail my comprehensive plan , not just to build things back to the way they were before COVID-19, but to build back better.To create millions of new, good-paying jobs with benefits where people get a fair return for work and we make our country stronger, more resilient, and more just.That plan will be anchored in job-creating investments, in small businesses, infrastructure -innovation, manufacturing, and caregiving, and in rewiring the faulty structures of our economy to ensure the dignity and equity of all American workers.The public health crisis, the job crisis, and the crisis of inequity and indignity being endured by African Americans , those three challenges are deeply connected to one another.The solutions must be, as well.Any economic plan must start with a public health plan to make sure tests are available, to get our society functioning, to build back the confidence we need to truly bring back jobs and small businesses.But that is only the first step.My jobs plan will also be about restoring dignity to the American people.In addition to pursuing badly-needed reforms, we need to be growing wages, leveling the playing field, and creating tens of millions of the new jobs we need to build a better American future.There is a monumental amount of work to do to repair the damage that has been done. And simply tweeting slogans like \u201ctransition to greatness\u201d won\u2019t solve anything for families who are hurting.I look forward to introducing and implementing a real jobs plan that will meet this challenging moment.Americans can\u2019t afford to have any more of their time wasted.They need an economy that works for them , now.They need jobs that bring dignity , now.They need equal justice , and equal opportunities , now.They need a president who cares about them, and cares about helping them heal , now.Thank you.God bless you , and may God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-economy-and-jobs-report-in-f58a3ccdecc?source=user_profile---------67----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Good afternoon.Before I speak to the economic situation, I have to take a moment to address something the President said this morning.Toward the end of his remarks today, Donald Trump said he hopes that George Floyd 'is looking down and seeing this is a great day for our country.'He was speaking of a man who was brutally killed by an act of needless violence , and by a larger tide of injustice , that has metastasized on this President's watch.George Floyd's last words , 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe' , have echoed across our nation.For the President to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd , is frankly despicable.And, the fact that he did so on a day when Black unemployment rose and black youth unemployment skyrocketed , tells you everything you need to know about who this man is and what he cares about.Today, like all Americans, I was glad to see that two-and-a-half million Americans have gotten their jobs back.For those families, that's a sigh of relief.And for all of us, it's a reminder of the resilience of the American people.To those Americans, I'm so proud of you, and so happy for you and your families.I was disturbed, however, to see the President crowing this morning , basically hanging a'mission accomplished' banner when there is so much work to be done , and so many Americans are still hurting.More than twenty million Americans , one out of every seven U.S. workers , are still out of work.For an enormous swath of our country, their dreams are still on hold.

America has four percent of the world's population , and more than a quarter of the world's deaths from this pandemic.It's no secret why that is.Let's get something straight: he did not act quickly.For months, he downplayed the threat , falsely promising us that anyone could get a test , and claiming that 'like a miracle it will disappear.'He repeatedly praised China's containment response , despite a litany of public appeals , including from me , not to bet American lives and the U.S. economy on the word of the Chinese government.He refused to take action to get adequate testing in place , allowing the virus to spread further than it should have.Columbia University found that 54,000 lives could have been saved if the administration had acted just two weeks earlier.His failure didn't just cost lives. It cost jobs.New studies this week from Moody's and Brookings confirm that half or more of those who lost their jobs would still be employed had Trump mounted a competent response like Germany and South Korea and other countries did.We know why this happened. Donald Trump was more focused on the stock wealth of the biggest corporations than he was on the well-being of the American people.It's why he had his top economic advisors telling people to buy stocks instead of preparing our nation to brace for the pandemic.Now , after 110,000 deaths and more than 20 million people still out of work , the consequences are clear.We are still facing devastating unemployment, an historic health crisis, and a continuing crisisof violence, injustice, and indignity that is devastating Black Americans and diminishing the soul of our country.These are some of the sternest challenges our nation has ever faced, and Trump is patting himself on the back.He just has no idea what's really going on in this country. He has no idea the depth of pain that people are facing. He remains completely oblivious to the human toll of his indifference. It is time for him to step out of his bunker and take a look around at the consequences of his words and actions.Let's be clear , a president who takes no responsibility for costing millions and millions of Americans their jobs deserves no credit when a fraction of them return.But there's a deeper concern here. As we recover, some of the temporary job losses we are still not on track to grow back in a way that will actually serve working people.President Trump is still rewarding wealth over work.All we hear coming out of the White House is calls for more tax cuts for big investors and big corporations. Well, they didn't build this country. The middle class did , that's who I fight for.And if Trump continues to put the interests of CEOs and shareholders ahead of American workers, we'll never get to where we need to be as a country.Look, every American has a choice to make this November. Not simply what kind of President we want , but what kind of country we want. What kind of economy we want , and who that economy serves.In the coming weeks, I will lay out in detail my comprehensive plan , not just to build things back to the way they were before COVID-19, but to build back better.To create millions of new, good-paying jobs with benefits where people get a fair return for work and we make our country stronger, more resilient, and more just.That plan will be anchored in job-creating investments, in small businesses, infrastructure -innovation, manufacturing, and caregiving, and in rewiring the faulty structures of our economy to ensure the dignity and equity of all American workers.The public health crisis, the job crisis, and the crisis of inequity and indignity being endured by African Americans , those three challenges are deeply connected to one another.The solutions must be, as well.Any economic plan must start with a public health plan to make sure tests are available, to get our society functioning, to build back the confidence we need to truly bring back jobs and small businesses.But that is only the first step.My jobs plan will also be about restoring dignity to the American people.In addition to pursuing badly-needed reforms, we need to be growing wages, leveling the playing field, and creating tens of millions of the new jobs we need to build a better American future.There is a monumental amount of work to do to repair the damage that has been done. And simply tweeting slogans like 'transition to greatness' won't solve anything for families who are hurting.I look forward to introducing and implementing a real jobs plan that will meet this challenging moment.Americans can't afford to have any more of their time wasted.They need an economy that works for them , now.They need jobs that bring dignity , now.They need equal justice , and equal opportunities , now.They need a president who cares about them, and cares about helping them heal , now.Thank you.God bless you , and may God protect our troops."}

To stir justice too long dormant and to move millions to act peacefully and purposefully.But among all the people around the world who feel connected to this tragedy, are the ones who lost something that can never, ever be replaced.To George\u2019s children and grandchild, I know you miss you Dad and Granddad.Little Gianna , as I said to you when I saw you yesterday, you are so brave. Daddy is looking down and he is so proud of you. And I know you miss that bear hug that only he could give. That pure joy riding on his shoulders so you could touch the sky. The countless hours he spent playing any game you wanted because your smile, your laugh, your love is the only thing that mattered in at the moment.And I know you have a lot of questions that no child should have to ask, questions that too many black children have had to ask for generations.Why? Why is Daddy gone?In looking through your eyes, we should all be asking ourselves why the answer is often too cruel and painful.Why, in this nation, do too many black Americans , wake up knowing they could lose their life , in the course of living their life?Why does justice not roll like a river nor righteousness like a mighty stream? Why?Yet, ladies and gentlemen , we cannot turn away. We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism that stings at our very soul and from systemic abuse that still plagues American life.As Thurgood Marshall once implored, \u201cAmerica must dissent from indifference we must dissent from fear, the hatred, and the mistrust we must dissent because America can do better because America has no choice but to do better.\u201dI grew up with Catholic Social Doctrine which taught me that faith without works is dead and you will know us by what we do.Ladies and Gentlemen, we\u2019ve got to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation to so many people for so long.

After years of Congressional Republicans blocking legislation, President Obama used his authority to ensure they could work and attend school and participate fully in the life of their communities without fear.The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was an historic achievement of the Obama-Biden Administration, and it was a monumental victory for all those proud members of the community who pushed and pushed for these young people to have a chance at the American dream. More than anything else, it was the right thing to do.What was true eight years ago, remains true today: Dreamers are already Americans in every way that matters. They are proud and patriotic. They serve our nation on the front lines of our military overseas, and they are serving on the front lines as we battle this pandemic at home. More than 200,000 DACA recipients are part of the essential workforce that has been carrying our nation through these past three months. Almost 30,000 of them work in health care. Simply put, they are committed to making this nation better and stronger, and our country cannot afford to lose their incredible talents. It\u2019s long past time we permanently remove the uncertainty and threat of deportation from their lives.Instead, Donald Trump and his anti-immigrant Administration have forced us backward with one cruel and outrageous executive action after another. Trump sees immigration as a wedge to divide and distract the American people from his manifold failures as President. He has executed a campaign of terror against immigrants and Latino communities, abandoned America\u2019s historic role as a safe haven for refugees and asylum-seekers, and even made it more difficult for people to immigrate to this country and obtain their citizenship legally. And, instead of working toward solutions to protect Dreamers, as he once promised to do, Donald Trump has ripped away protections from DACA recipients, throwing their lives into upheaval.Now, eight years after our Administration made history by creating DACA, the fate of more than 700,000 DACA recipients hangs on the outcome of a Supreme Court ruling. Imagine the anxiety these young people are facing every day, on top of the anger and stress being felt all across our country as we grapple with racial inequities in our society and the fears of living through a pandemic. Imagine going to bed last night wondering if this morning would be the day that decided your fate, or next Thursday, or the week after that. It\u2019s no way to live.When our Administration created the DACA program, we asked Dreamers to place their trust in a humane government that would treat them fairly. We told them we would not abuse their information. We promised to protect them from harm. The Trump Administration has done nothing but exploit that trust and abuse its power, pressuring Congress to push through a deal for a useless border wall in exchange for protecting Dreamers, re-opening long-closed deportation cases against DACA recipients, and most recently suggesting that deporting DACA recipients is \u201cattractive.\u201dImmigrant youth are not a negotiating chip. They are not disposable. They are an integral part of the American fabric. Their story is our story, and their struggles are our struggles. Donald Trump and the Republicans in Congress should stop threatening their lives for political gain and instead follow the leadership of Democrats and the House of Representatives and immediately pass into law the DREAM and PROMISE Act.DACA was never meant as a permanent solution. It was not meant to let Congress off the hook for providing a clear path for these young people to claim their citizenship. Dreamers deserve to be able to plan their lives with confidence, as do the 11 million undocumented individuals who are living in and enriching our country every day.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB176202053","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-06-17","SpeechTitle":"My Remarks in Darby, Pennsylvania, on Reopening the Economy Safely","RawText":"Good afternoon everyone.And thank you to all the local officials joining me today.Before I begin my remarks, I want to acknowledge that it was five years ago today when a white supremacist walked into the Mother Emanuel church in Charleston, South Carolina, and slaughtered my friend Reverend Clementa Pinckney and eight other parishioners.It was hatred unbridled. It was a poisonous expression of the white supremacy that still infects our nation and our institutions , and of the dangers we face as a society if we cannot root out this corrosive and deadly ideology.When I reflect back on the amazing grace and compassion and forgiveness of the Mother Emanuel community , I see the very best of who we are as Americans.But we know that grace alone is not enough , we have to put in the work.And we\u2019re seeing the best of America in that as well , in the weeks of peaceful protests and civil actions taking place in cities and towns of every size all across the country.People are keeping our eyes focused on how dangerous it is to live in Black and Brown skin in this country.And Americans are out there marching, notwithstanding the fact that we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic.On Monday, Donald Trump said, \u201cif we stopped testing right now\u201d for COVID, \u201cwe\u2019d have very few cases, if any.\u201d It\u2019s a statement that\u2019s not only absurd , it\u2019s absolutely tragic.And yesterday, the head of the White House task force on coronavirus , the Vice President , claimed success in this fight because deaths are \u201cdown to\u201d fewer than 750 a day.750 fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers and husbands,wives, children , dying every day.More than 20,000 a month. That\u2019s greater than World War II level casualties each month. That\u2019s more than five 9\/11\u2019s each month.And this Administration is self-congratulating?That may be good enough for Donald Trump, but it will never, ever be acceptable if I am President.Researchers have shown that tens of thousands of Americans have died needlessly because Donald Trump was slow to respond to this crisis, and then bungled the response.For weeks in January and February, I was raising my concerns about how we needed to take this virus seriously, all while Trump was ignoring the reporting from the intelligence community in his daily briefing and the warnings of his closest advisors, and praising the Chinese government for being transparent in its handling of the virus, instead of demanding access for the CDC that Beijing was refusing to give. The American people have sacrificed so much to fight this virus.We\u2019ve lost lives, we lost businesses, we\u2019ve lost paychecks. And now, thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s bungling, we may lose some of the progress we\u2019ve begun to make. All because he\u2019s lost interest. He\u2019s once again ignoring the facts. The public health response is still woefully lacking. More than 117,000 people have died in the United States, with the average daily number of cases still climbing in 21 states , and we still don\u2019t have what we need when it comes to rapid-results testing, contact tracing capacity, widely available personal protective equipment, or clear nationwide guidance.Instead, President Trump pushes dangerous, disproven drugs, stands in the way of the CDC issuing guidelines on reopening, and he refuses to wear a mask, failing even the most basic test of leadership. He\u2019s scaled back the meetings of the COVID-19 task force in spite of experts saying testing and tracing is necessary for reopening , he\u2019s sent his Testing Czar home.Of the money provided to the Pentagon for essential medical supplies, only 15 percent has been moved out the door.Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy , the coronavirus. But unlike any other war time leader, he takes no responsibility, he exercises no leadership, and now he\u2019s surrendering the fight.Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated.And he is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he\u2019ll put people at risk, in violation of CDC guidelines that still warn against large gatherings, as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable. Donald Trump\u2019s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives , and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.Jobs numbers and retail sales reports were better than expected in May. That\u2019s great news for our country. But now Donald Trump\u2019s desire to declare victory and be done with it will only imperil our continued progress.Our economy is still sputtering, with more than 20 million people unemployed and no clear guidance from the federal government for what businesses need to do to re-open safely and effectively for a strong recovery.This isn\u2019t a debate about whether to reopen , it\u2019s about how we make reopening work for everyone.The employees at the White House get daily COVID-19 tests. They know they are safe before they go to work , and they know their co-workers are safe. They have the confidence to resume their lives.Workers across the country aren\u2019t asking for daily testing , they\u2019re just asking for regular, reliable access to tests. Don\u2019t they deserve that?So it\u2019s not that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t recognize the importance of testing. It\u2019s that he\u2019s not up to the task. And now, he\u2019s seemingly decided that he doesn\u2019t even want to try. But just like he couldn\u2019t wish COVID-19 away in March, just like he couldn\u2019t tweet it away in April , he can\u2019t ignore it away in June. So I have some basic questions for President Donald Trump: What are you going to do to make sure every worker has access to regular testing so that they have the same confidence to go into a store or go back to work as White House staffers? Why are you leaving schools and child care centers to navigate this uncertainty all on their own without the effective guidance and resources they need to help protect kids and their communities?Why won\u2019t you enforce an OSHA standard for worker protections during a global pandemic?Why is it that the Main Street lending program, created more than two months ago by the Congress to help struggling small businesses, only opened for registration to lenders two days ago , and still hasn\u2019t distributed a single penny? And why won\u2019t you disclose the names of the businesses who received a total of $500 billion in taxpayer funding? Why are they being hidden?How many cronies got bailouts? How many donors?What businesses had to shut down because they were denied funding in April, and what businesses get special approval thanks to a nod from the top?Why did you get rid of the watchdog originally appointed to oversee it?What are you trying to hide? It\u2019s bad management on top of bad planning on top of neglect. And it\u2019s unacceptable. Folks, here\u2019s the truth: This pandemic is still here. It\u2019s going to be here for the foreseeable future , until we get it under control, or until we have a safe, proven, widely-available vaccine. COVID-19 is a fact of nature. We have to deal with this virus, and everything that comes with it, head on. And we can deal with it, if we put in the work and invest in building a dynamic, resilient economy and health system capable of getting , and then staying , ahead of new outbreaks. We have the capacity and the resources to do that.I\u2019ve laid out the baseline steps of what needs to be done , from the \u201cMake it Work\u201d checklist for a successful, accountable recovery that I put out back in early April, to the steps for a strong re-opening that I released last week.It\u2019s not rocket science. It\u2019s common sense. It\u2019s straightforward. And that\u2019s why this is perhaps the greatest indictment of Donald Trump\u2019s complete lack of leadership. He wasted months and months and months passing the buck, blaming everyone else, and refusing to act when we should have been preparing our country for a long-term response and building up our resiliency to respond to future flare-ups. Yet, we still don\u2019t have a comprehensive system for collecting COVID-19 case data. These are the basics. He should have been preparing us to weather the valleys and peaks of this virus. He should have been working to shore up the vulnerabilities in our health care system that have been laid bare by this crisis. He should have been working to bridge the inequities and strengthen the cracks in the foundation of our economic system that are exposed for all to see.He hasn\u2019t done any of it. And because of the depth of Donald Trump\u2019s failures, this pandemic will continue to be worse for all Americans, and much worse for Black and Brown Americans, who are getting hit the hardest. For folks in communities like Darby Borough and Yeadon. Donald Trump thinks that if he puts his head in the sand, the American people will too. But it doesn\u2019t work that way. Not when hundreds of people are still dying every day, and millions are unemployed, wondering how they\u2019re going to keep the lights on and food on the table.Not when workers are weighed down with worries about their safety or what happens if they get sick. And there are the steps that we need to be taking now to steer us , steady and strong , through these difficult times to a more resilient future. First, we have to do everything we can to avoid deadly spikes of infections as people begin to go back out into the world. We are not that much better prepared today for a run of cases that over-fills our intensive care units than we were 3 months ago. And second , we have to help give people the assurance and precautions that are necessary to restart our economy with confidence. If Americans lose what faith they have left in our government\u2019s ability to manage this pandemic, we will see a much deeper and longer-lasting economic impact that will have even greater repercussions for people\u2019s well-being. Mr. President: Don\u2019t leave the American people to face this threat on their own , with no guidance, resources, or leadership from the federal government.Don\u2019t let the support from the CARES Act expire next month while people are still hurting.Don\u2019t leave our front line workers exposed and without the resources they need. And don\u2019t waste any more of our time. The American people need the confidence of clear guidelines, grounded in science, that will allow them to resume their daily lives safely. American businesses need the support of the federal government to continue to backstop them through the phases of reopening, and workers need the assurance that their health is the first concern. America needs a president who will put the American people first, not his own ego. America needs a president who will do the work. I\u2019m ready on day one. After more than three years in office, why isn\u2019t Donald Trump?","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/my-remarks-in-darby-pennsylvania-on-reopening-the-economy-safely-4a869ea8b11?source=user_profile---------56----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Good afternoon everyone.And thank you to all the local officials joining me today.Before I begin my remarks, I want to acknowledge that it was five years ago today when a white supremacist walked into the Mother Emanuel church in Charleston, South Carolina, and slaughtered my friend Reverend Clementa Pinckney and eight other parishioners.It was hatred unbridled.

The United States has always strived to serve as a beacon of hope , a role model in resettling refugees and leading the humanitarian response abroad. But today is also a bitter reminder of how Donald Trump has tried to change America from a nation of refuge and liberty to one of division and intolerance. Fear-mongering, xenophobia, and racism are the unabashed tenets of Trump\u2019s refugee and immigration policy, and his divisive, dangerous, and undemocratic response to Black Lives Matter is a reminder of this administration\u2019s devaluation of Black, Brown, and other minority communities not only in the United States, but around the world. But we will not, and we cannot, allow hate and rage to divide us further. Decades ago, giants of the civil rights movement like Bayard Rustin recognized the universal fight for freedom and safety and urged the United States to accept more refugees. Their call is even more urgent today as the number of those forcibly displaced worldwide reaches nearly 80 million people worldwide , roughly 1 percent of humanity. Donald Trump has made clear that he does not believe our country should be a place of refuge. He has slashed refugee admissions by more than 80 percent and, just this past week, released an immoral and likely unlawful rule that makes it nearly impossible for most asylum-seekers to qualify for protection in the United States . He has cruelly separated thousands of children from their parents, sought to prevent victims of gang and domestic violence from receiving asylum, and severely limited the ability of members of the LGBTQ+ community, an especially vulnerable group in many parts of the world, from qualifying for asylum. And he has turned his back on the men and women who served honorably alongside our soldiers, diplomats, and aid workers in Iraq and Afghanistan as interpreters and guides, and now find that their lives, and the lives of their families, are threatened for this service. This cannot stand. As one of the co-sponsors of the 1980 Refugee Act, I believe that resettling refugees helps reunite families, enriches the fabric of America, and enhances our standing, influence, and security in the world. Right now, many refugees are also working on the frontlines of the pandemic response, as nursing aides, doctors, meatpackers, and grocery clerks, among other essential workers. Restoring America\u2019s historic role as leader in resettlement and defending the rights of refugees everywhere will take concrete action. As President, I will increase the number of refugees we welcome into this country, setting an annual global refugee target of 125,000 , up from a ceiling of 18,000 under Trump , and will seek to further raise it over time commensurate with our responsibility, our values, and the unprecedented global need. I will support efforts to work with Congress in a bipartisan fashion to protect our refugee policy from drastic and arbitrary reductions we have seen during the Trump Administration and establish a minimum admissions number of at least 95,000 refugees annually. I will pursue policies that increase opportunities for faith and local communities to sponsor refugee resettlement. I will make more channels, such as higher education visas, available to those seeking safety. I will repeal the Muslim ban , and other discriminatory bans based on ethnicity and nationality , and restore asylum laws, including ending the horrific practice of separating families at our border. I will work with our allies and partners to stand against China\u2019s assault on Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and mass detention and repression of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities and support a pathway for those persecuted to find safe haven in the United States and other nations. I also recognize that it is not enough to simply reverse or dismantle the heartless policies of the Trump Administration. We need to look for ways to do better. On this World Refugee Day, we all must stand together and recommit to building a more inclusive and welcoming America.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB256202048","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-06-25","SpeechTitle":"My Remarks on the Affordable Care Act in Lancaster, Pennsylvania","RawText":"Good afternoon.Today, in the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory, Donald Trump will file a brief in the Supreme Court to attempt to strip health coverage away from tens of millions of families, and to strip the peace of mind away from more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions.If he succeeds, more than 23 million Americans could lose their coverage outright , including nearly a million Pennsylvanians.Insurers could once again discriminate, or deny services, or drop coverage for people living with preexisting conditions like asthma, diabetes, and cancer.And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, complications from COVID-19 could become a new pre-existing condition. Some survivors will experience lasting health impacts , like lung scarring and heart damage. And if Donald Trump prevails in court, insurers would be allowed to strip away coverage or jack up premiums , simply because of their battle with the coronavirus. Those survivors, having struggled and won the fight of their lives, would have their peace of mind stolen away at the moment they need it most. They would live their lives caught in a vise between Donald Trump\u2019s twin legacies: his failure to protect the American people from the coronavirus, and his heartless crusade to take health care protections away from American families.I have called on Donald Trump many times to withdraw his lawsuit. Today, I am renewing that call.Mr. President, drop the lawsuit. Stop trying to take away people\u2019s health care.Now more than ever, stop trying to steal their peace of mind. I cannot comprehend the cruelty that is driving him to inflict this pain on the very people he is supposed to serve.One of the families the Affordable Care Act has delivered peace of mind to is the Ritters , who live not far from here in Manheim, Pennsylvania.Jan and Madeline Ritter were just four years old when their mom, Stacie, heard some of the most devastating words that a parent can ever hear. Both of her twins had been diagnosed with leukemia.I promise you , that news , it stops your heart. It wrenches your entire world off of its axis. And the very last thing on your mind , the very last thing that should be on your mind , is whether you can afford treatment.But when Stacie\u2019s twins got sick, there was no Affordable Care Act.So, after the draining days and the endless nights, the harrowing stem-cell transplants, the fickle waves of hope and fear, after enduring more than any parent should have to endure, the Ritters still faced a future where their twins could be denied coveragefor the rest of their lives.The Affordable Care Act was created to put a stop to that inhumanity , to ensure that people like Stacie, thrust into the worst nightmare of their lives, could focus on the fight that matters.Stacie\u2019s twins won their fight. They beat cancer , and now, they\u2019re 22 years old. Jan is studying early education at Elizabethtown College. Madeline just graduated from Arcadia University with a degree in international studies. And because of the law, insurance companies can no longer deny them coverage because they\u2019re survivors of cancer.I\u2019m proud of the Affordable Care Act.In addition to protecting people with pre-existing conditions, this is a law that delivered vital coverage to more than 20 million Americans.It\u2019s a law that bars insurance companies from capping Americans\u2019 benefits , and from charging women more simply because they are women.It\u2019s a law that reduced prescription drug costs for nearly 12 million seniors, who would see their those costs spike , because the Medicare \u2018donut hole\u2019would have suddenly reopened.It\u2019s a law that saves lives.But now, in the middle of the worst public health crisis in modern history, Donald Trump is suing to take the Ritters and millions more Americans , back to the way things were.It\u2019s cruel, it\u2019s heartless, and it\u2019s callous.And it\u2019s all because he can\u2019t abide the thought of letting stand one of President Obama\u2019s greatest achievements.We\u2019ve seen that same callousness in his handling of the coronavirus.Just over three months ago, as most Americans were first coming to grips with the unprecedented scale and danger of the pandemic, President Trump publicly claimed that, \u201cAnybody that wants a test can get a test.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t true. And he knew it.Then, five days ago, at his campaign gathering in Tulsa, he admitted telling his people to, slow the testing down, please.\u201d At first, his spokespeople tried to say he was joking. But then Trump himself said he wasn\u2019t joking.He called testing, \u201ca double-edged sword.\u201d Let\u2019s be crystal clear about what he means by that. Testing unequivocally saves lives, and widespread testing is the key to opening up our economy again , so that\u2019s one edge of the sword. The other edge: that he thinks finding out that more Americans are sick will make him look bad. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s worried about. He\u2019s worried about looking bad.Well, Donald Trump needs to stop caring about how he looks and start caring aboutwhat\u2019s really happening in America.The number of cases is increasing in 29 states. We are going to be dealing with this for a long time. Trump can\u2019t wish it away. He can\u2019t bend it to meet his political wishes. There are no miracles coming.We are going to have to step up as Americans , all of us , and do both the simple things , and the hard things , to keep our families and neighbors safe, to re-open our economy, and to eventually put the pandemic behind us.And sadly , we are going to have to do it without responsible leadership from the White House. So it is up to us. All of us.We\u2019re going to have to wear masks. And I know as Americans it\u2019s not something we\u2019re used to. But it matters. All the evidence from all over the world tells us it just might be the most effective thing we can do.We\u2019re going to have to socially distance. It\u2019s not easy. It seems so strange to us. Not as Americans, but as human beings. We\u2019re built to talk, to laugh, to hug, to gather with other people. I know I am. I know you are. But for now, we have to socially distance. It matters.We\u2019re going to have to find a way to keep our economy running as we bring the number of cases down. The president wants you to believe this is a choice between the economy and the public\u2019s health. He still hasn\u2019t grasped the most basic fact of this crisis: to fix our economy, we have to get control of the virus.He\u2019s like a child who just can\u2019t believe this has happened to him. It\u2019s all whining and self-pity. This pandemic didn\u2019t happen to him. It happened to all of us.And his job isn\u2019t to whine about it. His job is to do something about it.If I have the honor of becoming President, I promise you I will lead.I will do everything I can to take responsibility and ease that burden on you and your families. I will put your family first. And that will begin with a dramatic expansion of health coverage and bold steps to lower health care costs.We need a public option now more than ever , especially at a time when more than 20 million people are unemployed.That public option will allow every American , regardless of their employment status , the choice to get a Medicare-like plan.It will force private insurers to keep premiums low and offer better coverage because, for the first time, they\u2019ll have to compete for your business against a public insurer that doesn\u2019t have a profit motive.We\u2019re going to lower premiums for people buying coverage on their own by guaranteeing that no American ever has to spend more than 8.5 percent of their income on health insurance , and that number will be lower for lower-income families.We\u2019re also going to further reduce costs by making it less expensive for Americans to choose plans with lower deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses by lowering prescription drug prices and by ending the practice called \u201csurprise billing,\u201d which can leave you with an unexpectedly high bill after you leave a hospital.Here\u2019s the bottom line: my plan lowers health care costs and gets us to universal coverage quickly when Americans desperately need it.Families are reeling right now , enduring illnesses, forced into risky choices, losing their employer plans in droves.They need a lifeline now. That\u2019s what the families here today deserve. That\u2019s what families all across this nation deserve.They don\u2019t need a president going into court to deny them health care. They need a president going into the White House who will fight for the health care they need.If Donald Trump refuses to end his senseless crusade against health coverage, I look forward to ending it for him. And working quickly with Congress to dramatically ramp up protections, get America to universal coverage, and lower health care costs as soon as humanly possible.This is my promise to you. When I am President, I will take care of your health coverage the same way I would for my own family. This is personal to me.I was sworn into the United States Senate next to a hospital bed. My wife and daughter had been killed in a car crash , and lying in that bed were my two surviving little boys.I couldn\u2019t imagine what it would have been like if we didn\u2019t have the health care we needed immediately.Forty years later, one of those little boys, my son Beau, was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given only months to live.I couldn\u2019t imagine an insurance company coming in and saying, \u201cfor the last six months of your life, you\u2019re on your own\u201d , which is exactly what happened to so many families before the Affordable Care Act.So Amy, I understand.And when I say I\u2019ll take care of your health coverage the same way I would for my family , there is nothing I take more seriously.That\u2019s my promise to Stacie and Victoria and Amy and to every American.That\u2019s what the presidency is , a duty to care.A duty to care for everyone.Not just those who voted for us.For all of us.And no trust is more sacred, no responsibility is more solemn, no purpose is more fundamental, than for a President to do absolutely everything he or she can to protect American lives.So I want every single American to know: if you\u2019re sick, if you\u2019re struggling, if you\u2019re worried about how you\u2019re going to get through the day , I will not abandon you.I will not leave you to face these challenges alone.We are going to get through this , together.And we are going to build our health care system, our economy, and our country back better than it has ever been before.Thank you. God bless you, and God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/my-remarks-on-the-affordable-care-act-in-lancaster-pennsylvania-fb7b6b530369?source=user_profile---------51----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Good afternoon.Today, in the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory, Donald Trump will file a brief in the Supreme Court to attempt to strip health coverage away from tens of millions of families, and to strip the peace of mind away from more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions.If he succeeds, more than 23 million Americans could lose their coverage outright , including nearly a million Pennsylvanians.Insurers could once again discriminate, or deny services, or drop coverage for people living with preexisting conditions like asthma, diabetes, and cancer.And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, complications from COVID-19 could become a new pre-existing condition.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB266202047","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-06-26","SpeechTitle":"My Statement on the Trump Administration Stopping Funding for Federal Testing Sites Amid Climbing COVID-19 Cases","RawText":"On Saturday, President Trump told America that he wants testing to be slowed down for the sake of craven political optics. This week he doubled down, and we\u2019re painfully learning more about what that looks like.Now, on the very same day that America marked a record high for new COVID-19 cases, the Trump Administration announced that it was going to quickly strip funding from all federal testing sites nationwide , even from seven testing centers in Texas, a rapidly growing hotspot.President Trump thinks that if he just ignores COVID-19 it will go away. It\u2019s the exact same tactic Trump has tried since I, and others, raised the alarm about the coronavirus in January, and it\u2019s a defeatist mindset that\u2019s left over 120,000 Americans dead and our economy reeling with almost 20 million people out of work.Trump simply couldn\u2019t be more wrong.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB306202044","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-06-30","SpeechTitle":"My remarks on Trump\u2019s Failures To Protect The American People.","RawText":"For weeks, we\u2019ve seen the warning signs , the numbers don\u2019t lie. Infection rates are now going up in more states than they are going down. More than 125,000 people in the United States have lost their lives, and those numbers and new infections continue to grow at an alarming rate. And once again it\u2019s confirming the simple fact that we won\u2019t be able to solve the economic crisis without a rigorous public health approach. Despite the Administration\u2019s propaganda that their response should be \u201ca cause for celebration,\u201d despite President Trump\u2019s request that we should slow down testing, because he thinks it makes him look bad, COVID-19 is still here. A daily threat to American health and prosperity. It did not have to be this way. Month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us. Month after month, as many of us urged him to step up and do his job, he failed us. Just look at the record. In January, I sounded the alarm over the coronavirus outbreak. Trump told the country that he had COVID-19 \u201ctotally under control\u201d and that everything would all \u201cwork out well.\u201d In February, I warned about our failure to get information we needed from the Chinese government. I said if I were President, I would demand it. Trump said we were in \u201cgreat shape\u201d and reported that China\u2019s president said it was \u201cdoing very well.\u201d In March, I set forth a detailed plan for 500 federally-funded testing sites across the country as well as guaranteed emergency paid leave. And later that month, I called for the full and immediate use of the Defense Production Act to deliver critical supplies. Trump accused health care workers of stealing masks. In April, I released plans to secure the supply chain for personal protective equipment, surge nationwide testing through a Pandemic Testing Board, and launch a nationwide health corps to focus on contact tracing. Trump\u2019s suggestion? Americans should inject disinfectants into their bodies. In May, I condemned the false choice between preserving our public health and our economy. I urged the Administration to focus on the basic public health measures like testing that would enable us to sustain our economic recovery. Trump\u2019s response? He pushed for reopening without regard for safety and called testing \u201cfrankly overrated.\u201d This month, I outlined a path to reopen our country safely and sustainably. It provided workers, small businesses, schools, and state and local governments the tools, resources, and guidance they would need. Trump\u2019s proposal? He set a cutoff date for federal funding for testing sites in several states, and actually went to court to take health care away from millions. And now, Donald Trump is in retreat. Remember back in March when he called himself a wartime president? Remember when he exhorted the nation to \u201csacrifice together\u201d to face an \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d? What happened? Now it\u2019s almost July and it seems the wartime president has surrendered , has waved the white flag and left the field of battle. Today we\u2019re facing a serious threat, and we must meet it , as one country. But this President gives us no direction. He pits us against one another. We can\u2019t continue on like this , half recovering and half getting worse. We can\u2019t continue , half wearing masks and half rejecting science We can\u2019t continue , half with a plan and half just hoping for the best. We won\u2019t defeat this virus with a piecemeal approach , lifting restrictions prematurely, increasing the volatility of the crisis, and raising the likelihood of needing to re-impose restrictions. Until our science catches up to our reality , until we have better treatments for those who become infected and ultimately a safe, proven, widely available vaccine , we have to continue to do all we can as a people and as a government to keep our fellow Americans safe and healthy. Today, I am releasing a plan with the steps Donald Trump should undertake immediately. It builds on the roadmap I released back in March that would have saved lives if it had been adopted. It is a plan to save lives in the months ahead. Once again , I encourage him to adopt this plan in its entirety. This is too important for politics. First, testing, testing, testing. More testing is not only how you find more cases of coronavirus, Mr. President, it\u2019s how you stop more cases. Testing , followed by rigorous contact tracing and quarantine and isolation protocols for those who have been exposed. People aren\u2019t waiting in miles-long lines in baking hot cars for a drive-through nasal swab for the fun of it. They\u2019re doing it so they can protect themselves and their families. We know we\u2019re not where we need to be on testing. There are still hospitals and nursing homes that don\u2019t have access to the tests they need. Testing is how we see what\u2019s happening in communities all across the country. It\u2019s our eyes on the ground. Without it, we\u2019re flying blind. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to have reliable access to testing everywhere. We need to increase federal support for testing , that includes doubling the number of drive-through testing sites. And keep increasing them until there are no lines. We should create a Pandemic Testing Board to spearhead a nationwide campaign so every worker who is called back to their job can have the confidence that they and their co-workers are not infected. Experts agree that we need more contact tracers to track the path of this virus. Individual states like New York and California are already hiring and training thousands of tracers. But we need more,including hiring at least 100,000 federally funded workers to perform contact tracing and other public health tasks. Second, every single front line worker should have the personal protective equipment they need to be safe. Five months into this crisis, and our health care workers are still forced to scramble for their own supplies and must reuse masks , shift after shift. Hundreds of health care workers have died from COVID-19, and tens of thousands have been infected. It should be zero on both counts. How are we this many months in and we still , still , don\u2019t have what we need? This is why we have a Defense Production Act. Use your authority this week, Mr. President, to scale up the production of N-95 masks. The steps you\u2019ve taken so far haven\u2019t gotten the job done. Fix the shortage of PPE for our health care workers before you tee off for yet another round of golf. We can\u2019t just look at where we are today , we\u2019re going to need masks and gloves and face shields for the foreseeable future. We need to be ready. Third, there should be a laser-focus on treatments and vaccines. We should be leading a coordinated, global approach on the science , not disregarding the experts while pushing dangerous and disproven drugs as a treatment. There has been some progress towards treatments and vaccines. But the administration hasn\u2019t been transparent about how they plan to manufacture enough doses, and make sure they are equitably distributed at scale. Every person in the United States must be able to get the vaccine when available. The White House should report weekly on this progress. We can\u2019t end up with the same scarcity and distribution problems we did with testing. And we need to make sure that consumers aren\u2019t being gouged as new drugs and therapies are developed. We must immediately restore our relationship with the World Health Organization. For all its shortcomings and missteps around COVID-19, this is why the WHO was created. It is essential to coordinating a global response during a pandemic. And the United States should be leading the way. COVID-19 will likely worsen at the onset of flu season this year. So we need to put in place measures now to ensure the seasonal flu vaccine can be readily available and administered safely to those who need it under social distancing guidelines , especially for seniors. Fourth, we need real plans, real guidelines with uniform, nation-wide standards to help chart our economic reopening. Whatever it is that we\u2019re doing now , it\u2019s not working. A state-by-state approach will only produce confusion and slow any progress. The CDC tried to develop clear guidelines about what the stages of re-opening should look like , the Administration delayed and scaled them back. We need clear, evidence-based steps that states can adopt , both the standards that must be met in order to safely proceed with further opening, and the re-imposition of social distancing rules when cases begin to rise. We need to support schools and child care programs so parents can return to work, confident that their kids will be safe and cared for. We should be providing \u201cSafer for Shoppers\u201d certifications to stores that prove they are minimizing their customers\u2019 risk of exposure. And we absolutely need a clear message from the very top of our federal government , that everyone needs to wear a mask in public. Period. It\u2019s not just about you , it\u2019s about your family, your neighbors, your colleagues. It\u2019s about keeping other people safe. It\u2019s a simple measure that is also one of the most effective things we can do right now. It may be inconvenient , but it\u2019s the right thing to do as an American. Finally,we need to protect the populations most at risk from this virus. Our Seniors. Our Black and Brown and Native communities that are being hit the hardest. Vulnerable populations with pre-existing conditions. I know that this continued growth in case numbers is causing fear. People , especially older Americans and those with loved ones in nursing homes , are scared. This isn\u2019t just taking a toll on their physical health, there\u2019s an emotional cost as well. We can\u2019t expect vulnerable populations to quarantine indefinitely without support. And I want them to know that their health and safety will be my responsibility as president. I will not abandon you. Those are five simple, straightforward steps that will help us defeat this pandemic. And if you suspect that a lot of these steps are the same sorts of things I was talking about in March when I released my first COVID-19 Response Plan , you\u2019re right. If it feels like you\u2019ve been hearing the experts talk about these same issues for months , you\u2019re right. These have always been the steps the government needed to put in place to meet this threat. The state-wide lockdowns that so many Americans lived under for months were intended to buy us the time to get our act together. But instead of using that time to prepare ourselves , Donald Trump squandered it. Now here we are, more than three months later, and we\u2019re hardly better prepared than we were in March. Infections on the rise. The threat of massive spikes that overwhelm the capacity of our health care system. Americans anxious and out of work, fearful for their lives and their loved ones. And Donald Trump is doing next-to-nothing about it. Mr. President , the crisis is real , and it\u2019s surging. Promises and predictions and wishful thinking pulled out of thin air are not only doing this country no good, it\u2019s making them lose more faith in their government America knows this crisis isn\u2019t behind us. Even if you don\u2019t. They see what is happening. Even if you refuse to. They know a coordinated national plan is needed now. Even though you won\u2019t do it. You\u2019ve called yourself a \u201ccheerleader\u201d for the nation. We don\u2019t need a cheerleader. We need a President. A president who will level with the American people. A president who will tell us the unvarnished truth. A president who will take responsibility instead of always blaming others. A president who will listen to the experts and follow the science. A president who will lead and be an example for the nation: Wear a mask, keep your distance, limit the size of any crowd. It\u2019s not about you, Mr. President , it\u2019s about the health and well-being of the American public. The American people didn\u2019t make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rantings and tweets. They didn\u2019t make these sacrifices so you could ignore the science and turn responsible steps like wearing a mask into a political statement. And they certainly didn\u2019t do it so you could wash your hands and walk away. Maybe there are times this nation needs a cheerleader. Now isn\u2019t one of them. We need a president. Whatever Trump does , or does not do , we cannot know today what the state of the COVID-19 pandemic will be next January. But it almost certainly won\u2019t be over. If I should have the honor of being elected President, on the day I\u2019m sworn in I\u2019ll get right to work implementing all aspects of the response that remain undone. I\u2019ll have more to say about my Day One COVID-19 agenda in the weeks to come. But my response will begin well before I take the oath of office. It will start as soon as the election is decided. I will be a president who respects scientists, and who won\u2019t censor their ability to speak directly to the American people. I\u2019ll immediately reach out to Dr. Anthony Fauci to ask him to continue his incredible service to our country. I\u2019ll have from day one , ready to go , the best medical experts and scientists to advise on our response. And I\u2019ll listen to them. I will work with governors and mayors of both parties, and from every state, territory, and tribe. We are all in this together. We will fight this together. And we will emerge from this stronger, because we did it together. And now, I\u2019m happy to take a few of your questions.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/my-remarks-on-trumps-failures-to-protect-the-american-people-2428387e99c?source=user_profile---------47----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"For weeks, we've seen the warning signs , the numbers don't lie.

Those are five simple, straightforward steps that will help us defeat this pandemic. And if you suspect that a lot of these steps are the same sorts of things I was talking about in March when I released my first COVID-19 Response Plan , you're right. If it feels like you've been hearing the experts talk about these same issues for months , you're right. These have always been the steps the government needed to put in place to meet this threat. The state-wide lockdowns that so many Americans lived under for months were intended to buy us the time to get our act together. But instead of using that time to prepare ourselves , Donald Trump squandered it. Now here we are, more than three months later, and we're hardly better prepared than we were in March. Infections on the rise. The threat of massive spikes that overwhelm the capacity of our health care system. Americans anxious and out of work, fearful for their lives and their loved ones. And Donald Trump is doing next-to-nothing about it. Mr. President , the crisis is real , and it's surging. Promises and predictions and wishful thinking pulled out of thin air are not only doing this country no good, it's making them lose more faith in their government America knows this crisis isn't behind us. Even if you don't. They see what is happening. Even if you refuse to. They know a coordinated national plan is needed now. Even though you won't do it. You've called yourself a 'cheerleader' for the nation. We don't need a cheerleader. We need a President. A president who will level with the American people. A president who will tell us the unvarnished truth. A president who will take responsibility instead of always blaming others. A president who will listen to the experts and follow the science. A president who will lead and be an example for the nation: Wear a mask, keep your distance, limit the size of any crowd. It's not about you, Mr. President , it's about the health and well-being of the American public. The American people didn't make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rantings and tweets. They didn't make these sacrifices so you could ignore the science and turn responsible steps like wearing a mask into a political statement. And they certainly didn't do it so you could wash your hands and walk away. Maybe there are times this nation needs a cheerleader. Now isn't one of them. We need a president. Whatever Trump does , or does not do , we cannot know today what the state of the COVID-19 pandemic will be next January. But it almost certainly won't be over. If I should have the honor of being elected President, on the day I'm sworn in I'll get right to work implementing all aspects of the response that remain undone. I'll have more to say about my Day One COVID-19 agenda in the weeks to come. But my response will begin well before I take the oath of office. It will start as soon as the election is decided. I will be a president who respects scientists, and who won't censor their ability to speak directly to the American people. I'll immediately reach out to Dr. Anthony Fauci to ask him to continue his incredible service to our country. I'll have from day one , ready to go , the best medical experts and scientists to advise on our response. And I'll listen to them. I will work with governors and mayors of both parties, and from every state, territory, and tribe. We are all in this together. We will fight this together. And we will emerge from this stronger, because we did it together. And now, I'm happy to take a few of your questions."}

Like every American, I\u2019m glad that millions of American workers are back on payrolls and that this historic unemployment we still face has at least come down a bit more.This is a good day for every one of those individuals and families who regained their security.But as happy as I was for millions of workers returning to their jobs , there is one number I was stunned that the president didn\u2019t mention even once at his press conference.That number was 50,000.Yesterday, the number of new COVID-19 cases in America topped 50,000 in a single day. We\u2019ve never hit that number before in the course of this virus. In 45 states, the 7-day average of infections are higher than they were a week ago. In some places, hospital ICUs are at or nearing capacity. And we are seeing all across the country spikes in the virus that are causing many states to impose new restrictions again.To me, and to many Americans, this is a very worrisome turn in the path and severity of the virus. And the president didn\u2019t even address it.Yesterday he reiterated his belief that the virus was going to disappear.Today he described what was happening as \u201cfires\u201d flaring up in the country. That\u2019s just not an honest assessment of what is happening. And it\u2019s not just me saying that , the rest of the world knows it too.Just this week, 27 European countries have banned Americans from traveling there because of the surging numbers of COVID-19 in the U.S. and until this president faces what\u2019s going on in our country, our economy will remain at risk.Today\u2019s report is positive news, and I\u2019m thankful for it.But make no mistake: we are still in a deep, deep jobs hole because Donald Trump has so badly bungled the response to the coronavirus, and now has basically given up responding at all.Millions more Americans would still have their jobs today if Donald Trump had done his job. And many of the jobs that have now come back should never have been lost in the first place.And for everyone whose job hasn\u2019t come back , for everyone who doesn\u2019t own stock, or who can\u2019t get a sweetheart loan through connections , does this feel like victory?For parents who are worried their kids can\u2019t go back to school in the Fall, do you feel like this is \u201cmission accomplished\u201d?And for people in states where COVID-19 is spiking, and we\u2019re seeing record-high numbers of infections , do you feel like this crisis is under control?Of course not. People are scared. They\u2019re worried about their families and for the future.But, just like last month, President Trump has spiked the ball and made this about him. He doesn\u2019t seem to realize he\u2019s not even to the 50-yard line.Only one-third of the jobs that were lost in March and April have now come back , and most of the jobs that returned were for people on temporary furlough.That means these were the easiest jobs to get back as we re-open cities and states.It\u2019s only going to get harder from here.Permanent job loss numbers actually went up by 588,000 , to almost 3 million.President Trump touted the job gains for African American workers. But unemployment for black men actually rose , from 15.5 percent in May to 16.3 percent in June.He touted the numbers for Latino unemployment , but those numbers are still more than three times higher than they were before this crisis started.And let\u2019s not lose sight of a critical point. Treport measures job gains as of June 12.In the days since, we\u2019ve seen cases spiking, some businesses have to close down again, some states reimposing restrictions.And, in the last two weeks, we\u2019ve seen almost 3 million new unemployment filings, and another 1.7 million people seek special pandemic unemployment insurance.There\u2019s no victory to be celebrated when we\u2019re still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse, not better.Millions of Americans who are still out of work, wondering when or if their job will come back, and worried about how to pay the bills in the meantime.Trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved. He\u2019s deadly wrong , on both fronts. We\u2019re already at more than 128,000 dead , and that number keeps climbing. That\u2019s a direct consequence of Donald Trump\u2019s bungled leadership and total mismanagement of this crisis from the start. His failure to take quick action made this pandemic more costly for the American people in every way , in lives lost, in economic impact, in the emotional toll of living with so much doubt and uncertainty. And now , as I said on Tuesday , he\u2019s surrendered to this virus. Other countries have figured out how to get the virus under control, re-open their economies, and put their people back to work. Other leaders didn\u2019t waste the time they were given from stay at home orders , they got to work solving the root cause of this crisis , the coronavirus. Donald Trump\u2019s just given up. He\u2019s not even trying to secure our public health anymore. He\u2019d rather get back to his campaign rallies. He\u2019s not interested in uniting us to fight our common threat. He\u2019s decided he has more to gain by dividing this country for his own political purposes. Without a uniform plan, and guidance from the federal government that state and local leaders can use to inform their re-opening plans, this is going to continue to be worse than it would otherwise be. Recovery will be slower. Unemployment will stay higher than it should be. Has he even once expressed real empathy for the families who will never again be whole because of this virus? Has he done anything real to prioritize support for working Americans who need help now? Democrats in Congress have put forward legislation to reward and protect our brave frontline workers, help working families find child care, and extend the supplemental unemployment benefits for people for the duration of the economic crisis. Meanwhile Republicans and President Trump are stalling on support for working families, even as they dole out tax-payer money to big corporations with zero accountability. Has Donald Trump even acknowledged the disproportionate impact this disease is having on Black and Brown and Native communities , much less done anything to address these health disparities or the underlying systemic racism that shapes them? Of course not. That would require him to step up and lead. It would require him to put the American people ahead of his own interests. It didn\u2019t have to be like this. America has more reported deaths and infections than anywhere else in the world. Our health care workers are still rationing personal protective equipment. We still don\u2019t have sufficient testing to allow people to return to work with confidence.President Trump has turned wearing a mask into a political statement. And just yesterday, he was once more claiming that the coronavirus would \u201cjust disappear, I hope.\u201d It\u2019s like deja vu all over again. We\u2019re months into this crisis and that\u2019s still your best answer? Quit hoping for the best, Mr. President.Quit claiming victory with almost 15 million Americans still out of work because of this crisis.Quit ignoring the reality of this pandemic and the horrifying loss of American life.Act. Lead. Or get out of the way so others can.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/my-remarks-on-the-economic-crisis-and-jobs-report-644dc30a3f62?source=user_profile---------46----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Good morning , today we learned the latest jobs numbers.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB97202041","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-07-09","SpeechTitle":"The future must be made in America \u2014 by all of America. Here\u2019s how we\u2019ll do it:","RawText":"\u201cBuild Back Better\u201d Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President Joe Biden in Dunmore, Pennsylvani.Thank you. It\u2019s great to be back in Scranton. It\u2019s great to be back in Dunmore. And it\u2019s great to be back home. I want to thank Bob and everyone here at McGregor Industries for showing me around this morning. This is the kind of small manufacturing business that demonstrates the resilience, creativity, and staying-power of America\u2019s industrial base. We\u2019re living through a time unlike any in American history. Our country is facing three crises simultaneously. A pandemic that has infected over 3 million Americans and cost more than 130,000 lives , and shows no signs of slowing down. An economic crisis that has left almost 18 million Americans out of work , with some of the greatest pain inflicted on small businesses and communities of color. And a national reckoning on the issue of racial injustice that has long plagued our country. These come on top of widening economic inequality and a mounting climate crisis. Each of these is an enormous challenge that is testing our strength, our patience, our resilience, our commitment to our core values, and our commitment to one another. But each of these is also a tremendous opportunity for our nation. An opportunity to prepare now for the future threats we know are rising around the world. An opportunity to address the fundamental inequities in our nation , the growing gap between the very wealthy and everyone else. And an opportunity to finally , and fully , live up to the words and the values enshrined in the founding documents of this nation. That we are all created equal and are entitled to be treated equally throughout our lives. We all know the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. That\u2019s why this is no time for divisive politics. Donald Trump may believe in pitting Americans against Americans. I don\u2019t. We have a health crisis. An economic crisis. A racial justice crisis. A climate crisis. And we need to come together as Americans to solve them. This is our moment to imagine and to build a new American economy for our families and the next generation. An economy where every American gets a fair return for their work , and an equal chance to get ahead. An economy that is more powerful precisely because everyone is cut in on the deal. An economy that says investing in the American people and working families is more important than the nearly $2 trillion dollar tax break Trump predominantly handed out to the richest Americans. Donald Trump loves to talk and talk and talk. But after three and a half years of big promises, what do the American people have to show for it? He promised a health care plan , but he never even offered his own bill. Instead he fought repeatedly to take health care away from tens of millions. He promised an infrastructure plan and never delivered. He promised to bring back jobs, but manufacturing was in recession even before COVID-19. He promised to buy American, but he let federal contractors double the rate of offshoring jobs in his first 18 months in office. And when it comes to COVID-19, after months of doing nothing other than predicting the virus would disappear , Trump has simply given up. He\u2019s waved the white flag and walked away. And his failures come with a terrible human cost and a deep economic toll. Time and time again, working families are paying the price for Donald Trump\u2019s incompetence. Small business has ended up with the short end of the stick, too. Less than a third of the massive amount of money the Congress and the Federal Reserve made available to the private sector has gone to Main Street businesses. Big business , the wealthy , Trump\u2019s cronies and pals , they\u2019ve been the big winners, again. The truth is, throughout this crisis, Donald Trump has been almost singularly focused on the stock market the Dow the NASDAQ not you not your families. But if I\u2019m elected president, I will be laser-focused on working families and the middle class , not the wealthy investor class. And this will be my guiding principle: We will reward hard work , not excessive wealth. You see, growing up rich and looking down on people is very different from how I grew up here in Scranton. Here, nobody thought Wall Street bankers and CEOs built this country. You could just look around your neighborhood , or your kitchen table , and see who built this country. It was at my grandfather Finnegan\u2019s kitchen table that I learned money doesn\u2019t determine your worth. He\u2019d say: Joey, no one in the world is more worthy than you , and everyone is your equal. My dad taught me: A job is about a lot more than a paycheck , it\u2019s about dignity, respect, your place in the community. And I remember my uncle saying, \u201cJoey, you\u2019re labor from belt buckle to shoe sole\u201d , and I took pride in it. Determination. Resilience. Grit. The strength to get up no matter how many times you\u2019ve been knocked down. Respect for hard work. And for the people who do it. Those are the values I learned growing up in Scranton. And those are the values I\u2019ll take with me into the Oval Office. I\u2019ll give more help to Main Street businesses and entrepreneurs and ask more of corporate America. Nearly half the jobs in America are in small businesses. And even back in early May, some estimates found that more than 100,000 small businesses had been permanently shut down. More have closed since. It\u2019s been devastating. Enough. Enough. It\u2019s time to reverse the priorities in this country. Let\u2019s help small businesses manage through this pandemic and recover , and let\u2019s help millions of would-be entrepreneurs get out from under their debts so they can start a business. And it\u2019s time corporate America paid their fair share in taxes. The days of Amazon paying nothing in federal income taxes should be over. Let\u2019s make sure their workers have more power and a voice. It\u2019s way past time we put an end to this era of shareholder capitalism. The idea that the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders is an absolute farce. They have a responsibility to their workers, to their community and their country. That isn\u2019t a new or radical notion. Those are the basic values and principles , that helped build this nation. Now the challenge is to take those fundamental values , and apply them to the new economy we have to build in the years ahead. I call my plan to do it the \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan. It\u2019s bold. It\u2019s practical. It\u2019s focused on building the economy of the future, not the past. And it responds to five truths laid bare in this moment of crisis. First, we\u2019ve seen in the course of this pandemic the need to strengthen our industrial base as a long-term source of middle class job creation. Let\u2019s use this opportunity to make bold investments in American industry and innovation so the future is Made In America , and in all of America. I do not accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we can\u2019t keep well-paid union jobs here in America , and create more of them. I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. American manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II, and must be part of the engine of American prosperity now. So today, I\u2019m releasing a detailed blueprint for how we create millions of good-paying union jobs building the products and technologies we will need now and in the future. It starts with a pretty basic idea: when we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. My plan would tighten the rules to make this a reality. And it goes further. During my first term alone, we\u2019ll invest $400 billion to purchase products and materials our country needs to modernize our infrastructure, to replenish our critical stockpiles, and to enhance our national security. These funds will provide a reliable, predictable demand for products made by American workers and supply chains of American small businesses. We\u2019ll purchase clean energy technologies to fight climate change; building materials, including steel products like those produced here; stockpiles of critical goods and equipment; and advanced technologies to modernize our government and enhance our national security. To ensure the future is made in America, we need to win not just the jobs of today , but the jobs and industries of tomorrow. That means fighting unfair trade practices and curbing the theft of American intellectual property by countries like China. America can\u2019t sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. That\u2019s why I am proposing a dramatic Research & Development investment , $300 billion in my first four years alone , to sharpen America\u2019s competitive edge in new industries where global leadership is up for grabs, like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and clean energy. And this money will be used purposefully to ensure all of America is in on the deal , including communities that have historically been left out , Black, Brown, and Native American entrepreneurs, cities and towns in every region of the country. All told, this will be a mobilization of R&D and procurement investments in ways not seen since World War II. In addition to bringing back the jobs that have been lost this year, my plan will help create at least five million new jobs , good paying jobs , in manufacturing and innovation right here in the United States. Second, we\u2019ve seen the importance of a more resilient economy for the long-term. Our president wasn\u2019t prepared for the pandemic. He ignored the detailed briefings and warnings about the threat of pandemics that we gave to his administration in the transition. He shut down the pandemic office we had in the White House. He praised the Chinese government even as the virus was coming to our shores because he was so afraid they would walk away from his trade deal. Let\u2019s not get caught flat-footed again. Let\u2019s get prepared to meet the accelerating climate crisis. That means investing in infrastructure and clean energy and creating millions of good-paying union jobs in the process. Next week, I\u2019ll be laying out an updated blueprint for how we build a modern, safe, sustainable infrastructure and clean energy economy , how we make sure the communities who have suffered the most from pollution are first to benefit from this investment , and how to strengthen the union movement, by making sure that unions are building America, just like they built the middle class. Third, we\u2019ve seen in this pandemic the immense burdens working parents, and especially women, are carrying as they try to work and care for their children or their aging parents or their loved ones with disabilities. It\u2019s been especially hard in this crisis , but let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s always hard. So let\u2019s make it easier to afford child care and care for aging relatives. And let\u2019s offer more pay and more economic dignity for the millions of workers , often women, and women of color , who we entrust to help teach our youngest and care for our oldest loved ones. Donald Trump has no idea what it is to be a single parent who\u2019s barely getting by but needs to find child care. He hasn\u2019t a clue what it\u2019s like to provide care for an aging parent. That\u2019s understandable. But it\u2019s unconscionable that he doesn\u2019t even really try to empathize with those who are struggling. Like a lot of you, I understand it personally. I know how hard it is to be a single dad who has to work with two young sons at home. I know what it means to bring your aging parent into your home to take care of them in their final years. I\u2019ve done both. And it\u2019s hard. And it\u2019s hard for millions of Americans who are just trying to make ends meet. In the weeks ahead, I\u2019ll be laying out a plan to mobilize American talent and hearts to build a 21st century caregiving and education workforce. Fourth, we\u2019ve seen millions of American workers and small business owners put their lives on the line to keep our country going. We need to treat these folks and their families as essential not just in times of crisis , but at all times. Maybe Donald Trump can look those grocery store workers in the eye and tell them they\u2019re not worth $15 an hour, or spend time with frontline workers and then tell them they shouldn\u2019t have the right to organize for better pay, paid leave, benefits, and working conditions. Maybe he can. But I can\u2019t. And I won\u2019t. It\u2019s not enough to just praise these workers. We need to pay them. And let\u2019s finish the job of Obamacare by ensuring everyone has access to quality affordable health care. Let\u2019s lower the cost of prescription drugs, stop the surprise bills, and provide a public option to cover the millions of Americans without care. Let\u2019s make sure everyone has access to a good education regardless of their zip code. Let\u2019s triple the amount of money we direct to Title 1 schools in America. You\u2019ve got 18 Title 1 schools here in Scranton and Dunmore. Imagine how big a difference that will make. I think because of this pandemic, everyone has a renewed appreciation for just how hard our teachers work and how important their job is , let\u2019s give them the resources and support they need to both get through this crisis and to empower the next generation of American ground- breakers. Let\u2019s pay them. Finally, we\u2019ve seen with horrifying clarity the costs of systemic racism in America. We need a comprehensive agenda for racial equity in this country. This isn\u2019t just about police reform. It\u2019s about dealing with the deep wound of systemic racism in this nation. So, we need a dedicated agenda to close the wealth gap, to expand affordable housing, to invest in Black, Brown, AAPI and Native American entrepreneurs, and to make real the promise of educational opportunity. For too long the battle for racial equity has divided America , when it should unite us. Donald Trump cynically claims that he is defending America\u2019s heritage by embracing a flag and public monuments to people who tried to permanently rip this nation apart. Do you think Trump has any idea that 360,000 Pennsylvanians fought on the side of the Union to defeat that flag , including more Black soldiers than any other state. Do you think he has any clue that 33,000 Pennsylvanians died in the Civil War fighting against everything that flag stood for. I see a different America than Trump. One that, despite all our flaws and shortcomings and failings, is still after more than two centuries dedicated to equality, liberty, human dignity and justice. The challenges we face today are among the biggest in our history. We have to come together as a country to solve them , there is no other way. I have long said that America is at its best when we are one people, one nation, One America. That\u2019s the tragedy of Donald Trump being our president today. He is exactly the wrong person to lead us at this moment. He will not bring this country together. He is determined to drive us apart. He will not be a president for all the people. He believes he was elected to represent only his base. He will not appeal to the best in us. He is determined to stoke and revive the worst moments from our past. I have no illusions about how tough the road ahead is for our country. But I\u2019m optimistic for one reason above all others. I know the history and the heart of this country. And given the chance , just a chance , ordinary Americans can do extraordinary things. They have never, ever, ever let their country down. And they won\u2019t let the country down now. The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself. So we just need to remember who we are. This is the United States of America. And there is nothing , not a single thing , we have ever failed to do. When we\u2019ve done it together. Thank you.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/the-future-must-be-made-in-america-by-all-of-america-heres-how-we-ll-do-it-4b21e67aaba1?source=user_profile---------43----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"'Build Back Better' Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President Joe Biden in Dunmore, Pennsylvani.Thank you. It's great to be back in Scranton. It's great to be back in Dunmore. And it's great to be back home. I want to thank Bob and everyone here at McGregor Industries for showing me around this morning. This is the kind of small manufacturing business that demonstrates the resilience, creativity, and staying-power of America's industrial base. We're living through a time unlike any in American history. Our country is facing three crises simultaneously. A pandemic that has infected over 3 million Americans and cost more than 130,000 lives , and shows no signs of slowing down. An economic crisis that has left almost 18 million Americans out of work , with some of the greatest pain inflicted on small businesses and communities of color. And a national reckoning on the issue of racial injustice that has long plagued our country. These come on top of widening economic inequality and a mounting climate crisis. Each of these is an enormous challenge that is testing our strength, our patience, our resilience, our commitment to our core values, and our commitment to one another. But each of these is also a tremendous opportunity for our nation. An opportunity to prepare now for the future threats we know are rising around the world. An opportunity to address the fundamental inequities in our nation , the growing gap between the very wealthy and everyone else. And an opportunity to finally , and fully , live up to the words and the values enshrined in the founding documents of this nation. That we are all created equal and are entitled to be treated equally throughout our lives. We all know the stakes couldn't be higher. That's why this is no time for divisive politics. Donald Trump may believe in pitting Americans against Americans. I don't. We have a health crisis. An economic crisis. A racial justice crisis. A climate crisis. And we need to come together as Americans to solve them. This is our moment to imagine and to build a new American economy for our families and the next generation. An economy where every American gets a fair return for their work , and an equal chance to get ahead. An economy that is more powerful precisely because everyone is cut in on the deal. An economy that says investing in the American people and working families is more important than the nearly $2 trillion dollar tax break Trump predominantly handed out to the richest Americans. Donald Trump loves to talk and talk and talk. But after three and a half years of big promises, what do the American people have to show for it? He promised a health care plan , but he never even offered his own bill. Instead he fought repeatedly to take health care away from tens of millions. He promised an infrastructure plan and never delivered. He promised to bring back jobs, but manufacturing was in recession even before COVID-19. He promised to buy American, but he let federal contractors double the rate of offshoring jobs in his first 18 months in office. And when it comes to COVID-19, after months of doing nothing other than predicting the virus would disappear , Trump has simply given up. He's waved the white flag and walked away. And his failures come with a terrible human cost and a deep economic toll. Time and time again, working families are paying the price for Donald Trump's incompetence. Small business has ended up with the short end of the stick, too. Less than a third of the massive amount of money the Congress and the Federal Reserve made available to the private sector has gone to Main Street businesses. Big business , the wealthy , Trump's cronies and pals , they've been the big winners, again. The truth is, throughout this crisis, Donald Trump has been almost singularly focused on the stock market the Dow the NASDAQ not you not your families. But if I'm elected president, I will be laser-focused on working families and the middle class , not the wealthy investor class. And this will be my guiding principle: We will reward hard work , not excessive wealth. You see, growing up rich and looking down on people is very different from how I grew up here in Scranton. Here, nobody thought Wall Street bankers and CEOs built this country. You could just look around your neighborhood , or your kitchen table , and see who built this country. It was at my grandfather Finnegan's kitchen table that I learned money doesn't determine your worth. He'd say: Joey, no one in the world is more worthy than you , and everyone is your equal. My dad taught me: A job is about a lot more than a paycheck , it's about dignity, respect, your place in the community. And I remember my uncle saying, 'Joey, you're labor from belt buckle to shoe sole' , and I took pride in it. Determination. Resilience. Grit. The strength to get up no matter how many times you've been knocked down. Respect for hard work. And for the people who do it. Those are the values I learned growing up in Scranton. And those are the values I'll take with me into the Oval Office. I'll give more help to Main Street businesses and entrepreneurs and ask more of corporate America. Nearly half the jobs in America are in small businesses. And even back in early May, some estimates found that more than 100,000 small businesses had been permanently shut down. More have closed since. It's been devastating. Enough. Enough. It's time to reverse the priorities in this country. Let's help small businesses manage through this pandemic and recover , and let's help millions of would-be entrepreneurs get out from under their debts so they can start a business. And it's time corporate America paid their fair share in taxes. The days of Amazon paying nothing in federal income taxes should be over. Let's make sure their workers have more power and a voice. It's way past time we put an end to this era of shareholder capitalism. The idea that the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders is an absolute farce. They have a responsibility to their workers, to their community and their country. That isn't a new or radical notion. Those are the basic values and principles , that helped build this nation. Now the challenge is to take those fundamental values , and apply them to the new economy we have to build in the years ahead. I call my plan to do it the 'Build Back Better' plan. It's bold. It's practical. It's focused on building the economy of the future, not the past. And it responds to five truths laid bare in this moment of crisis. First, we've seen in the course of this pandemic the need to strengthen our industrial base as a long-term source of middle class job creation. Let's use this opportunity to make bold investments in American industry and innovation so the future is Made In America , and in all of America. I do not accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we can't keep well-paid union jobs here in America , and create more of them. I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. American manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II, and must be part of the engine of American prosperity now. So today, I'm releasing a detailed blueprint for how we create millions of good-paying union jobs building the products and technologies we will need now and in the future. It starts with a pretty basic idea: when we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. My plan would tighten the rules to make this a reality. And it goes further. During my first term alone, we'll invest $400 billion to purchase products and materials our country needs to modernize our infrastructure, to replenish our critical stockpiles, and to enhance our national security. These funds will provide a reliable, predictable demand for products made by American workers and supply chains of American small businesses. We'll purchase clean energy technologies to fight climate change; building materials, including steel products like those produced here; stockpiles of critical goods and equipment; and advanced technologies to modernize our government and enhance our national security. To ensure the future is made in America, we need to win not just the jobs of today , but the jobs and industries of tomorrow. That means fighting unfair trade practices and curbing the theft of American intellectual property by countries like China. America can't sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. That's why I am proposing a dramatic Research & Development investment , $300 billion in my first four years alone , to sharpen America's competitive edge in new industries where global leadership is up for grabs, like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and clean energy. And this money will be used purposefully to ensure all of America is in on the deal , including communities that have historically been left out , Black, Brown, and Native American entrepreneurs, cities and towns in every region of the country. All told, this will be a mobilization of R&D and procurement investments in ways not seen since World War II. In addition to bringing back the jobs that have been lost this year, my plan will help create at least five million new jobs , good paying jobs , in manufacturing and innovation right here in the United States. Second, we've seen the importance of a more resilient economy for the long-term. Our president wasn't prepared for the pandemic. He ignored the detailed briefings and warnings about the threat of pandemics that we gave to his administration in the transition. He shut down the pandemic office we had in the White House. He praised the Chinese government even as the virus was coming to our shores because he was so afraid they would walk away from his trade deal. Let's not get caught flat-footed again. Let's get prepared to meet the accelerating climate crisis. That means investing in infrastructure and clean energy and creating millions of good-paying union jobs in the process. Next week, I'll be laying out an updated blueprint for how we build a modern, safe, sustainable infrastructure and clean energy economy , how we make sure the communities who have suffered the most from pollution are first to benefit from this investment , and how to strengthen the union movement, by making sure that unions are building America, just like they built the middle class. Third, we've seen in this pandemic the immense burdens working parents, and especially women, are carrying as they try to work and care for their children or their aging parents or their loved ones with disabilities. It's been especially hard in this crisis , but let's face it, it's always hard. So let's make it easier to afford child care and care for aging relatives. And let's offer more pay and more economic dignity for the millions of workers , often women, and women of color , who we entrust to help teach our youngest and care for our oldest loved ones. Donald Trump has no idea what it is to be a single parent who's barely getting by but needs to find child care. He hasn't a clue what it's like to provide care for an aging parent.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB147202037","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-07-14","SpeechTitle":"We\u2019re Going To Build Back Better and Create a Clean Energy Future","RawText":"Good afternoon. Yes, I\u2019m here today to talk about infrastructure, jobs, and our clean energy future. But I have to start by speaking to what millions of Americans know when they wake up every morning with more worry, anxiety, and fear , we are still a country in crisis. This pandemic has infected more than 3 million Americans. It has cost more than 135,000 lives , and it shows no signs of slowing down. In just the last few days, 19 states reported record cases, including Florida, which saw more than 15,000 new cases in a single day. Hospitalizations and deaths , two of the most concerning indicators of Trump\u2019s failed response , are already unacceptably high, and they\u2019re rising. It\u2019s gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public. I\u2019m glad he made that shift , but it\u2019s not enough, Mr. President.We won\u2019t be able to turn the corner and get the American people back to work safely without presidential leadership. \u201cOpen everything now\u201d isn\u2019t a strategy for success. It\u2019s barely a slogan. Quit pushing the false choice between protecting our health and protecting our economy. All that does is endanger our recovery on both fronts. Please listen to your own public health experts instead of denigrating them. Do your job, Mr. President. Because if we can\u2019t deal with the public health crisis, we can\u2019t deal with the economic crisis or deal with almost 18 million Americans who are out of work, and the incredible pain inflicted on small businesses and communities of color. And we can\u2019t deal with the climate crisis that could cast an even darker and more permanent shadow over our country and the world. And we won\u2019t be able to do what America has always done , come back stronger than everwith grit, toughness, and resilience That\u2019s what I want to talk about today. Last week, I shared the outlines of my plan to Build Back Better , a bold plan to build an economy of the future, not the past. The first plank of the plan rejects the defeatist view that automation and globalization mean we can\u2019t ensure our future is Made in America, with good-paying union jobs here at home. We clearly can. But today, I\u2019m here in Wilmington to talk about the second plank , how we can create millions of high-quality, union jobs by building a modern infrastructure and a clean energy future. These are the most critical investments we can make for the long-term health and vitality of the American economy and the safety of the American people. Even if we weren\u2019t facing a pandemic and an economic crisis, we should be making these investments. One in five miles of our highways are still in \u201cpoor condition.\u201d Tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair. Tens of millions of Americans lack access to high-speed broadband. To get our people to work and our kids to school safely, to get our goods to market swiftly, and to power a clean energy revolution in this country, we need to modernize America\u2019s infrastructure.Despite this overwhelming need, this President and Republicans in Congress have simply failed to act. They continue to break promises to the American people. Donald Trump promised a big infrastructure bill when he ran in 2016. He promised it again in 2017 and in 2018 and in 2019. And he\u2019s promising one again. Every few weeks when he needs a distraction from the latest charge of corruption in his staff , or the conviction of high ranking members of his administration and political apparatus , the White House announces it\u2019s \u201cInfrastructure Week.\u201d But he\u2019s never delivered. Never even really tried. Well, I know how to get it done. In 2009, President Obama and I inherited an economy in free fall, and we prevented another Great Depression. We enacted the largest infrastructure plan since President Eisenhower\u2019s interstate highway system, not only generating jobs, but improving the safety of our roads. We made the largest investment in clean energy in history , 90 billion dollars. It put us on a path toward a thriving clean energy economy, powering new economic growth and reducing energy costs. Here we are now with the economy in crisis, but with an incredible opportunity not just to build back to where we were before, but better, stronger, more resilient, and more prepared for the challenges that lie ahead. And there is no more consequential challenge that we must meet in this next decade , than the onrushing climate crisis. Left unchecked, it is an existential threat to the health of our planet and to our very survival. That\u2019s not up for dispute, Mr. President. When Donald Trump thinks about climate change , he can muster is one word: \u201choax.\u201d When I think about climate change , I think of a word as well: \u201cjobs.\u201d Good-paying, union jobs that put Americans to work: making the air cleaner for our kids to breathe, restoring our crumbling roads and bridges and ports, and making it faster, cheaper, and cleaner to transport American-made goods all across this country, and around the world. Jobs to build and install a network of 500,000 charging stations all across the country, which will not only help the American auto industry lead the world in manufacturing electric vehicles, it will save working families money on gas. Jobs to lay the lines for the second great railroad revolution, which will not only slash pollution , it will slash commute times and open up investment in areas connected to metropolitan centers for the first time. When Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy, he sees windmills somehow causing cancer. When I think about those wind-farms, I see American manufacturing , and American workers , racing to dominate the global market. I see the steel that will be needed , for the windmill platforms and towers and ladders that could be made by small manufacturers like McGregor Industries, where I visited last week. And I see the union-trained and certified men and women who will manufacture and install it all. I see the ports that will come back to life , the longshoremen, and the ship builders, and the communities they support. When Donald Trump thinks about improving energy efficiency by retrofitting lighting systems with LED bulbs, you want to know what he says? He says he doesn\u2019t like LEDs because: the light\u2019s no good. I always look orange.\u201d When I think about energy retrofitting for lighting, I see incredible projects like the one here at the Chase Center. I see the small businesses like Preferred Electric that design and install award-winning energy conservation measures that reduce the consumption of electricity and save businesses hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs. I see the master electricians and union workers who went through union apprenticeships , who start off with good wages and quality benefits that only grow from there. These investments will be a win-win-win for this country. Creating jobs. Cutting energy costsbills. Protecting our climate. That\u2019s why today I\u2019m releasing my plan to mobilize millions of jobs by building sustainable infrastructure and an equitable clean energy future. In my first four years, we\u2019re going to give 4 million buildings all across the country the same energy make-over that the Chase Center got. It\u2019s going to create at least one million jobs in construction, engineering and manufacturing to get it done. It\u2019s going to make the places where we live, work, and learn healthier, improving indoor air quality and water quality, and it\u2019s going to save tens of billions of dollars of energy costs over time. But we\u2019re not just going to focus on commercial space, we\u2019re going to give direct support to help families do the same thing for their homes. We\u2019re going offer cash rebates and low-cost financing to upgrade energy inefficient appliances and windows , improvements that will also cut their monthly energy bills. And we\u2019re going to make a major investment to build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that will benefit our communities three-times over: by alleviating the affordable housing crisis, by increasing energy efficiency, and by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to home ownership.Last week I talked about using the purchasing power of the federal government to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing , that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do with the American auto industry as well. The United States owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles , and we\u2019re going to convert those government fleets to electric vehicles , made and sourced right here in the United States of America.With the government providing the demand and the grants to re-tool factories that are struggling to compete, the U.S. auto industry and its deep bench of suppliers will step up , expanding capacity so that the United States , not China , leads the world in clean vehicle production. And we\u2019re going to make it easier for American consumers to switch to electric vehicles too. Not only by building those 500,000 charging stations, but by offering rebates and incentives to swap older, fuel inefficient vehicles for new, clean, American-made models, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil annually. Together, this will mean one million good new jobs in the American auto industry, its supply chains, and the associated infrastructure. We also know that transforming the American electricity sector to produce power without also producing carbon pollution , and electrifying an increasing share of our economy , will be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century. That\u2019s why we are going to achieve a carbon-pollution free electricity sector by 2035. And we need to get to work right away. We\u2019ll need scientists at national labs and land-grant universities and HBCUs to improve and innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean electricity. We\u2019ll need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them. We\u2019ll need iron workers and welders to install them. And we\u2019ll become the world\u2019s largest exporter of these technologies, creating even more jobs. We know how to do this. Our administration rescued the auto industry and helped them retool, made solar energy the same cost as traditional energy, weatherized more than a million homes , and we will do it again , bigger and faster and smarter. And, as we do this work, we need to be mindful of the historic wrongs and the damage that America\u2019s industrial rise in the 20th century inflicted on the environment in poor and vulnerable communities , so often Black, Brown, and Native American communities. Polluted air. Polluted water. Toxins raining down on communities that bore the environmental and health burdens, but shared none of the profits. Growing up, breathing that in every day , it\u2019s poison. That\u2019s partly why there are such incredible rates of childhood asthma in Black and Brown communities. Why Black Americans are almost three times more likely to die of asthma-related causes than white Americans. It\u2019s \u201cCancer Alley\u201d in St. James Parish in Louisiana. And it\u2019s the cancer clusters along Route 9 here in Delaware. And that\u2019s why, today, I\u2019m also releasing a slate of environmental justice policies that build on my existing plan. This is an area of incredible opportunity for economic growth for our country , but we have to make sure that the first people to benefit are those who have been hurt the most by centuries of structural disparities. I\u2019m setting a goal of making sure that these frontline and fenceline communities, whether in rural places or in city centers, receive 40 percent of the benefits from the investments we\u2019re making , in housing, in pollution reduction, in workforce development, in transportation , across the board. And we\u2019re also going to create jobs for people by cleaning up the environmental hazards that have now been abandoned. More than a quarter million jobs , right away , to do things like plug the millions of abandoned oil and gas wells that exist all across this country, posing a daily threat to the health and safety of our communities. And we\u2019re going to hold accountable those CEOs and corporations that benefited from decades of subsidies , then just walked away from their responsibilities to these communities , leaving wells to leak dangerous pollutants and greenhouse gasses into the air and water. And we\u2019re not only going to repeal those subsidies, we\u2019re going to go after those golden parachutes the CEOs gave themselves before declaring bankruptcy, and make sure workers receive the benefits and retirements they were promised. Let\u2019s create new markets for our family farmers and ranchers , and a new, modern day Civilian Climate Corps to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. These aren\u2019t pie-in-the-sky dreams. They\u2019re actionable policies that we can get to work on right away. We can live up to our responsibilities, meet the challenges of a world at risk of a climate catastrophe, build more climate-resilient communities, put millions of skilled workers on the job, and make life markedly better and safer for the American people all at once. The alternative , to ignore the facts, to deny reality, to focus only on the technology of the last century, instead of inventing the technologies that will define this century , it\u2019s just plain un-American. That is all that Donald Trump and the Republicans offer: Backward-looking politics that will harm the environment, make communities less healthy, and hold back economic progress while other countries race ahead. It\u2019s a mindset that doesn\u2019t have any faith in the capacity of the American people to compete, to innovate, and to win. And it will extract a deadly cost. I know better. And I know you do, as well. I know what the American people are capable of. I know what American workers can accomplish when given the room to run. I know that climate change is the challenge that\u2019s going to define our American future , and I know meeting this challenge will be a once-in-a-century opportunity to jolt new life into our economy, strengthen our global leadership, and protect our planet for future generations. And, if I have the honor of being elected President, we\u2019re not just going to tinker around the edges.We\u2019re going to make historic investments that will seize this opportunity and meet this moment in history. We\u2019re going to get to work delivering results right away , on day one. We\u2019re going to reverse Trump\u2019s roll backs of 100 public health and environmental rules , and then forge a path to greater ambition. We\u2019re going to get back into the Paris Agreement , and back into the business of leading the world. And we\u2019re going to lock-in progress that no future president can roll back or undercut to take us backwards again. Science requires a timeline for measurable progress on climate that isn\u2019t three decades or even two. Science tells us we will only have nine years to act before the damage is irreversible. So my timeline for results is my first four years as president , the jobs we\u2019ll create, the investments we\u2019ll make, and the irreversible steps we\u2019ll take to mitigate and adapt to climate change and to put our nation on the road to net-zero emissions by no later than 2050.So let\u2019s not waste any more time. Let\u2019s get to work. Thank you.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/were-going-to-build-back-better-and-create-a-clean-energy-future-a636131d57ba?source=user_profile---------39----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Good afternoon. Yes, I'm here today to talk about infrastructure, jobs, and our clean energy future. But I have to start by speaking to what millions of Americans know when they wake up every morning with more worry, anxiety, and fear , we are still a country in crisis. This pandemic has infected more than 3 million Americans. It has cost more than 135,000 lives , and it shows no signs of slowing down. In just the last few days, 19 states reported record cases, including Florida, which saw more than 15,000 new cases in a single day. Hospitalizations and deaths , two of the most concerning indicators of Trump's failed response , are already unacceptably high, and they're rising. It's gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public. I'm glad he made that shift , but it's not enough, Mr. President.We won't be able to turn the corner and get the American people back to work safely without presidential leadership. 'Open everything now' isn't a strategy for success. It's barely a slogan. Quit pushing the false choice between protecting our health and protecting our economy. All that does is endanger our recovery on both fronts. Please listen to your own public health experts instead of denigrating them. Do your job, Mr. President. Because if we can't deal with the public health crisis, we can't deal with the economic crisis or deal with almost 18 million Americans who are out of work, and the incredible pain inflicted on small businesses and communities of color. And we can't deal with the climate crisis that could cast an even darker and more permanent shadow over our country and the world. And we won't be able to do what America has always done , come back stronger than everwith grit, toughness, and resilience That's what I want to talk about today. Last week, I shared the outlines of my plan to Build Back Better , a bold plan to build an economy of the future, not the past. The first plank of the plan rejects the defeatist view that automation and globalization mean we can't ensure our future is Made in America, with good-paying union jobs here at home. We clearly can. But today, I'm here in Wilmington to talk about the second plank , how we can create millions of high-quality, union jobs by building a modern infrastructure and a clean energy future. These are the most critical investments we can make for the long-term health and vitality of the American economy and the safety of the American people. Even if we weren't facing a pandemic and an economic crisis, we should be making these investments. One in five miles of our highways are still in 'poor condition.' Tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair. Tens of millions of Americans lack access to high-speed broadband. To get our people to work and our kids to school safely, to get our goods to market swiftly, and to power a clean energy revolution in this country, we need to modernize America's infrastructure.Despite this overwhelming need, this President and Republicans in Congress have simply failed to act. They continue to break promises to the American people. Donald Trump promised a big infrastructure bill when he ran in 2016. He promised it again in 2017 and in 2018 and in 2019. And he's promising one again. Every few weeks when he needs a distraction from the latest charge of corruption in his staff , or the conviction of high ranking members of his administration and political apparatus , the White House announces it's 'Infrastructure Week.' But he's never delivered. Never even really tried. Well, I know how to get it done. In 2009, President Obama and I inherited an economy in free fall, and we prevented another Great Depression. We enacted the largest infrastructure plan since President Eisenhower's interstate highway system, not only generating jobs, but improving the safety of our roads. We made the largest investment in clean energy in history , 90 billion dollars. It put us on a path toward a thriving clean energy economy, powering new economic growth and reducing energy costs. Here we are now with the economy in crisis, but with an incredible opportunity not just to build back to where we were before, but better, stronger, more resilient, and more prepared for the challenges that lie ahead. And there is no more consequential challenge that we must meet in this next decade , than the onrushing climate crisis. Left unchecked, it is an existential threat to the health of our planet and to our very survival. That's not up for dispute, Mr. President. When Donald Trump thinks about climate change , he can muster is one word: 'hoax.' When I think about climate change , I think of a word as well: 'jobs.' Good-paying, union jobs that put Americans to work: making the air cleaner for our kids to breathe, restoring our crumbling roads and bridges and ports, and making it faster, cheaper, and cleaner to transport American-made goods all across this country, and around the world. Jobs to build and install a network of 500,000 charging stations all across the country, which will not only help the American auto industry lead the world in manufacturing electric vehicles, it will save working families money on gas. Jobs to lay the lines for the second great railroad revolution, which will not only slash pollution , it will slash commute times and open up investment in areas connected to metropolitan centers for the first time. When Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy, he sees windmills somehow causing cancer. When I think about those wind-farms, I see American manufacturing , and American workers , racing to dominate the global market. I see the steel that will be needed , for the windmill platforms and towers and ladders that could be made by small manufacturers like McGregor Industries, where I visited last week. And I see the union-trained and certified men and women who will manufacture and install it all. I see the ports that will come back to life , the longshoremen, and the ship builders, and the communities they support. When Donald Trump thinks about improving energy efficiency by retrofitting lighting systems with LED bulbs, you want to know what he says? He says he doesn't like LEDs because: the light's no good. I always look orange.' When I think about energy retrofitting for lighting, I see incredible projects like the one here at the Chase Center. I see the small businesses like Preferred Electric that design and install award-winning energy conservation measures that reduce the consumption of electricity and save businesses hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs. I see the master electricians and union workers who went through union apprenticeships , who start off with good wages and quality benefits that only grow from there. These investments will be a win-win-win for this country. Creating jobs. Cutting energy costsbills. Protecting our climate. That's why today I'm releasing my plan to mobilize millions of jobs by building sustainable infrastructure and an equitable clean energy future. In my first four years, we're going to give 4 million buildings all across the country the same energy make-over that the Chase Center got. It's going to create at least one million jobs in construction, engineering and manufacturing to get it done. It's going to make the places where we live, work, and learn healthier, improving indoor air quality and water quality, and it's going to save tens of billions of dollars of energy costs over time. But we're not just going to focus on commercial space, we're going to give direct support to help families do the same thing for their homes. We're going offer cash rebates and low-cost financing to upgrade energy inefficient appliances and windows , improvements that will also cut their monthly energy bills. And we're going to make a major investment to build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that will benefit our communities three-times over: by alleviating the affordable housing crisis, by increasing energy efficiency, and by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to home ownership.Last week I talked about using the purchasing power of the federal government to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing , that's what we're going to do with the American auto industry as well. The United States owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles , and we're going to convert those government fleets to electric vehicles , made and sourced right here in the United States of America.With the government providing the demand and the grants to re-tool factories that are struggling to compete, the U.S. auto industry and its deep bench of suppliers will step up , expanding capacity so that the United States , not China , leads the world in clean vehicle production. And we're going to make it easier for American consumers to switch to electric vehicles too. Not only by building those 500,000 charging stations, but by offering rebates and incentives to swap older, fuel inefficient vehicles for new, clean, American-made models, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil annually. Together, this will mean one million good new jobs in the American auto industry, its supply chains, and the associated infrastructure. We also know that transforming the American electricity sector to produce power without also producing carbon pollution , and electrifying an increasing share of our economy , will be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century. That's why we are going to achieve a carbon-pollution free electricity sector by 2035. And we need to get to work right away. We'll need scientists at national labs and land-grant universities and HBCUs to improve and innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean electricity. We'll need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them. We'll need iron workers and welders to install them. And we'll become the world's largest exporter of these technologies, creating even more jobs. We know how to do this. Our administration rescued the auto industry and helped them retool, made solar energy the same cost as traditional energy, weatherized more than a million homes , and we will do it again , bigger and faster and smarter. And, as we do this work, we need to be mindful of the historic wrongs and the damage that America's industrial rise in the 20th century inflicted on the environment in poor and vulnerable communities , so often Black, Brown, and Native American communities. Polluted air. Polluted water. Toxins raining down on communities that bore the environmental and health burdens, but shared none of the profits. Growing up, breathing that in every day , it's poison. That's partly why there are such incredible rates of childhood asthma in Black and Brown communities. Why Black Americans are almost three times more likely to die of asthma-related causes than white Americans. It's 'Cancer Alley' in St. James Parish in Louisiana. And it's the cancer clusters along Route 9 here in Delaware. And that's why, today, I'm also releasing a slate of environmental justice policies that build on my existing plan. This is an area of incredible opportunity for economic growth for our country , but we have to make sure that the first people to benefit are those who have been hurt the most by centuries of structural disparities. I'm setting a goal of making sure that these frontline and fenceline communities, whether in rural places or in city centers, receive 40 percent of the benefits from the investments we're making , in housing, in pollution reduction, in workforce development, in transportation , across the board. And we're also going to create jobs for people by cleaning up the environmental hazards that have now been abandoned.

When foreign states direct hackers, trolls, money launderers, and misinformation to subvert or cast doubt on our elections, they threaten America\u2019s sovereignty, democratic institutions, and national security. They undermine the vote and the voice of every U.S. citizen. They attack our very way of life.The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has concluded that the Kremlin\u2019s interference in past elections represented \u201conly the latest installment in an increasingly brazen interference by the Kremlin on the citizens and democratic institutions of the United States.\u201d Despite the exposure of Russia\u2019s malign activities by the U.S. Intelligence Community, law enforcement agencies, and bipartisan Congressional committees, the Kremlin has not halted its efforts to interfere in our democracy. In Senate testimony on July 23 2019, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that Russia was \u201cabsolutely intent on trying to interfere with our elections.\u201d And on March 27, 2020, the State Department held a briefing describing how Russia was recklessly spreading disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. Russia is not the only foreign actor seeking to interfere in our democracy. Increasingly, other states have shown an interest in copying Russia\u2019s tactics.Congress passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017. The Trump administration has thus far failed to make adequate use of these authorities to counter and deter foreign election interference. Instead, President Trump has repeatedly denied that Russia interfered in our elections, most egregiously during a joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on July 16, 2018.In spite of President Trump\u2019s failure to act, America\u2019s adversaries must not misjudge the resolve of the American people to counter every effort by a foreign power to interfere in our democracy, whether by hacking voting systems and databases, laundering money into our political system, systematically spreading disinformation, or trying to sow doubt about the integrity of our elections.That is why, today, I am putting the Kremlin and other foreign governments on notice. If elected president, I will treat foreign interference in our election as an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation\u2019s government. I will direct the U.S. Intelligence Community to report publicly and in a timely manner on any efforts by foreign governments that have interfered, or attempted to interfere, with U.S. elections. I will direct my administration to leverage all appropriate instruments of national power and make full use of my executive authority to impose substantial and lasting costs on state perpetrators. These costs could include financial-sector sanctions, asset freezes, cyber responses, and the exposure of corruption. A range of other actions could also be taken, depending on the nature of the attack. I will direct our response at a time and in a manner of our choosing.In addition, I will take action where needed to stop attempts to interfere with U.S. elections before they can impact our democratic processes. In particular, I will direct and resource the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Foreign Interference Task Force to develop plans for disrupting foreign threats to our elections process. This will be done, wherever possible, in coordination with our allies and partners, so that we are isolating the regimes that seek to undermine democracies and civil liberties.I have no desire to escalate tensions with Russia or any other country. I would prefer to focus the full energies of my administration on bringing the international community together to fight COVID-19 and the economic pain it has caused, and to tackle other pressing issues of international concern. But if any foreign power recklessly chooses to interfere in our democracy, I will not hesitate to respond as president to impose substantial and lasting costs.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/my-statement-on-foreign-interference-in-u-s-elections-8b42b4444eb6?source=user_profile---------36----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Foreign interference in the U.S. electoral process represents an assault on the American people and their constitutional right to vote.

Despite the exposure of Russia's malign activities by the U.S. Intelligence Community, law enforcement agencies, and bipartisan Congressional committees, the Kremlin has not halted its efforts to interfere in our democracy. In Senate testimony on July 23 2019, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that Russia was 'absolutely intent on trying to interfere with our elections.' And on March 27, 2020, the State Department held a briefing describing how Russia was recklessly spreading disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. Russia is not the only foreign actor seeking to interfere in our democracy. Increasingly, other states have shown an interest in copying Russia's tactics.Congress passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017. The Trump administration has thus far failed to make adequate use of these authorities to counter and deter foreign election interference. Instead, President Trump has repeatedly denied that Russia interfered in our elections, most egregiously during a joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on July 16, 2018.In spite of President Trump's failure to act, America's adversaries must not misjudge the resolve of the American people to counter every effort by a foreign power to interfere in our democracy, whether by hacking voting systems and databases, laundering money into our political system, systematically spreading disinformation, or trying to sow doubt about the integrity of our elections.That is why, today, I am putting the Kremlin and other foreign governments on notice. If elected president, I will treat foreign interference in our election as an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation's government. I will direct the U.S. Intelligence Community to report publicly and in a timely manner on any efforts by foreign governments that have interfered, or attempted to interfere, with U.S. elections. I will direct my administration to leverage all appropriate instruments of national power and make full use of my executive authority to impose substantial and lasting costs on state perpetrators. These costs could include financial-sector sanctions, asset freezes, cyber responses, and the exposure of corruption. A range of other actions could also be taken, depending on the nature of the attack. I will direct our response at a time and in a manner of our choosing.In addition, I will take action where needed to stop attempts to interfere with U.S. elections before they can impact our democratic processes. In particular, I will direct and resource the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Foreign Interference Task Force to develop plans for disrupting foreign threats to our elections process. This will be done, wherever possible, in coordination with our allies and partners, so that we are isolating the regimes that seek to undermine democracies and civil liberties.I have no desire to escalate tensions with Russia or any other country. I would prefer to focus the full energies of my administration on bringing the international community together to fight COVID-19 and the economic pain it has caused, and to tackle other pressing issues of international concern. But if any foreign power recklessly chooses to interfere in our democracy, I will not hesitate to respond as president to impose substantial and lasting costs."}

She has had to lean on her parents to help. It\u2019s really tough.But parents like Sarah, and places like this center, and the caregivers and educators who work here , they also give me a lot of hope.That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t think of a better place to talk about the third plank of my Build Back Better plan for our economy.This one is about easing the squeeze on working families that are raising their kids and caring for aging loved ones. And it\u2019s about creating jobs with better pay and career pathways for caregivers, and showing them the dignity and respect they deserve.But I know it\u2019s hard to think of that future when you\u2019re just trying to get through the crisis at hand.I know that\u2019s the case for child care facilities across the country.They\u2019ve had to close their doors and layoff staff. They\u2019re not getting the protective equipment they need as they reopen.In virus hotspots, they can\u2019t reopen at all.We are in a child care emergency. It didn\u2019t have to be this way. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on the President to get these facilities the resources and equipment they need , now.Enough.Each day the pandemic\u2019s death toll grows.Each day, in some states, more people test positive than the day before.Each day too many Americans are still out of work, losing hope.It\u2019s been reported by his own staff that the President is \u201cnot really working this anymore. He doesn\u2019t want to be distracted by it.\u201dHis own staff admits that Donald Trump fails the most important test of being the American President: the duty to care , for you, for all of us.It\u2019s also been reported that he will block any funding for more testing and tracing in the next COVID-relief bill , just as states report record cases, and hospitalizations and deaths continue to rise.He simply doesn\u2019t understand.We can\u2019t deal with our economic crisis without solving the public health crisis.And for all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help the working families hit the hardest.He has quit on you and he has quit on this country.But this election is not just about him.It\u2019s about us.It\u2019s about you.And I will do what a President is supposed to do.Care. Lead. And never give up.Over the last two weeks I\u2019ve shared my agenda for economic recovery.I call it Build Back Better, because we can\u2019t just build back to the way things were before. The first plank rejects the defeatist view that automation and globalization mean we can\u2019t ensure American workers lead us to a future Made in America. The second plank helps us outcompete the rest of the world and tackle climate change. It will put millions of Americans to work in good union jobs, modernizing our infrastructure while building a clean energy future.Today, I\u2019m outlining the third plank , mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in this country.If we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying. And we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators. Even before the pandemic, millions of working families have faced enormous financial and personal strains trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability.It\u2019s the sandwich generation that includes everyone from an 18-year-old daughter caring for her mother who suddenly gets sick, to a 40-year-old Dad raising his child and caring for his own aging parents.The joy and love are always there. But it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s really, really hard. Families are squeezed emotionally and financially.They need help, but often can\u2019t find it or afford it.And the professional caregivers out there , home health workers, child care workers , who are more often women, women of color, and immigrants , are too often underpaid, unseen, and undervalued.Then the pandemic hits and the squeeze tightens for everyone.Nursing homes have been hit hard.If you\u2019re a frontline worker, you struggle to find safe child care for your kids.Others of you have become unexpected 24\/7 caregivers, trying to keep your children safe and learning, while you\u2019re working remotely yourself.Or you\u2019ve had to put your career on hold indefinitely, or seen your hours cut, or your job lost.The confusion over schools reopening only makes things worse.And the last few months has only underscored how vital it is for families and older Americans to have more home and community care choices that best fit their needs.We are trapped in a caregiving crisis within an economic crisis within a public health crisis.You\u2019re doing everything you can, but this President is not.If I\u2019m your president, here\u2019s what I would do.First, let\u2019s start with caring for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities and helping them live independently.Here\u2019s an example.Right now there are 800,000 people who are eligible for home and community care through Medicaid and who have signed up for it.But they are all waiting for that phone call back.For some, the wait is five years. Five years. My plan makes a bold investment so that states can clear that waiting list. And to make sure we ease the financial burden for more families going forward, we will make long-term federal investments.We will have a major innovation fund to allow states to test and expand successful ways that improve home and community care, increase prevention, and reduce costs and hospitalizations.Think of expanded vital services like rides to appointments, meals and day programs for seniors, and making their homes safer for them.This builds on an initiative we created under the Affordable Care Act. The very program that this President ceaselessly tries to gut.For example, there\u2019s a pilot program in 27 cities in 16 states where a nurse, occupational therapist, and a handyman come to a home that\u2019s caring for an aging family member.They might not be able to cure a mother\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s, but they can make sure she doesn\u2019t break her hip.They walk through the house and install the handrail in the right spot in the bathroom, or fix the door so it doesn\u2019t stick as she tries to open it.An initial trial found that about $3,000 in program costs yielded more than $20,000 in savings.Simple steps that save lives, save money, and provide critical peace of mind.Here\u2019s another example.Whether in rural North Carolina or central Philadelphia, people of color in economically distressed communities face punishing health disparities from systemic discrimination.They don\u2019t have health insurance. They don\u2019t see a doctor. Language is a barrier.They slip through the gaps so their treatable condition turns into a chronic condition.That\u2019s why community health workers are real heroes. They go into these communities and make sure folks are getting the care they need. My plan puts 150,000 more of these workers in our communities throughout the country.These are things we can do now.Second, we can also make high-quality child care more affordable and accessible.My child care plan is straightforward.Every 3- and 4-year-old child will get access to free, high-quality preschool like students have at this center.And low-to middle-income families won\u2019t spend more than 7% of their income on child care for children under age 5.The most hard-pressed working families won\u2019t have to spend a dime. Here\u2019s how it works.They can either get up to an $8,000 tax credit for child care.For a middle-class family with a couple of young kids spending about $300 a week on child care, that means annual tax savings of $8,000 in their pocket. That means everything to working parents living paycheck to paycheck.Or the federal government would send funding to states, which then work with child care providers to cover the costs for working families with young children over 7% of their income.So, say both parents work and need child care.You go to childcare.gov, which we created under the Obama-Biden Administration, to help you find child care that works for you.Under my plan, it takes you to your state website. Local child centers pop up. You can call or fill in your information. You apply. The state then sends you a letter saying that you\u2019re approved and lays out the amount you\u2019re going to pay. The state sends that information to the child care provider. And then the state reimburses that child care center on the back end.You just pay what you\u2019re supposed to pay , not a dime for some working families and no more than 7% for others.We can do that. This would save families thousands of dollars.And there are other common-sense steps we can take, like expanding a tax credit for businesses to build child care facilities on site, or supporting more after-care, weekend, and summer care for families.Third, as we expand access to caregiving, we need to pay and support our caregivers.They do God\u2019s work, but home health workers aren\u2019t paid much. They have few benefits. Forty-percent are still on SNAP or Medicaid.So my plan is direct.It gives caregivers and early childhood educators a much needed raise.No one should have to work more than one job to make ends meet.Under my health care plan that defends and expands Obamacare, they will have more affordable health insurance. I will make sure these workers have an effective way to unionize and collectively bargain to protect their rights and earned benefits.This plan will help workers, especially those without a college degree, gain new skills in good-paying industries like health care, and provide new pathways to advance their careers.For example, a home health worker can access the training needed to become an EMT, a nurse, a physician\u2019s assistant, or a doctor. Or an early childhood educator can receive the coaching to keep delivering high-quality learning experiences.We can do this.The bottom line is that a mobilized caregiving and early education workforce would: save working families time and money, get their loved ones the care and early childhood education they need, and put more people to work.It\u2019s a triple win. That keeps seniors in their homes if they choose. That recognizes the realities facing modern families , and provides them much-needed economic support in the middle of a pandemic. Just imagine. We can put 3 million Americans to work in new care and early childhood education jobs. And combined with my proposal to provide families with up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, we can free up millions more people to join the paid labor force. Meaning at least 2 million additional jobs and more economic growth for our nation. This is a fresh, bold way to build up a critical part of our labor force and help us recover faster and stronger.When we usually talk about a jobs package, there is a big push for shovel-ready jobs.But that\u2019s what care jobs are.These workers are ready now. These jobs can be filled now. Allowing millions of people, primarily women, to get back to work now.It is the right thing to do for our families and our most essential workers.And it is the smart thing to do for our economy.Today, millions of our people can\u2019t fully pursue the jobs and careers they dream of due to our caregiving squeeze.That means tens of billions of dollars less in wages each year for our families.It means more disruption for our businesses, and less jobs and growth for our economy.This is both a moral and an economic imperative for our nation.And we pay for it by rolling back unproductive tax cuts for high-income real estate investors while ensuring high-income earners pay their tax bills. We invest those savings of $775 billion over ten years into building our economy back better than before.And tomorrow, I\u2019ll be joining a virtual townhall with SEIU members , home care workers, fast food workers, janitors , to hear directly from them about why this matters so much.Because, you see, this is also about something bigger.It\u2019s about the dignity and respect for working people. And that\u2019s precisely what this election is about, too.The American President has a duty to care for us all.To see people where they are. To understand what they\u2019re going through and where they want to be.I\u2019ve been a single parent. Even though I had a lot more support than a lot of folks going through tough times, I know how hard it is.So very, very hard.When Jill and I got married, I saw how difficult it was for her to start her teaching career while being a new mom. We cared for our parents to the end, my mom moved in with us.Our entire family was there for our Beau when he died from cancer.We know what so many of you are going through.But now everything just feels different.There\u2019s just that feeling, that sense where you just don\u2019t know if everything will be okay.But I\u2019m here to tell you that it can be , it will be.You know, my Dad was an honorable, decent man. He never went to college. He got knocked down a few times, but always got up. He worked hard and built a great middle-class life for our family.He used to say, \u201cJoey, I don\u2019t expect the government to solve my problems, but I expect them to understand my problems.\u201dI understand , to my very core.And I know that together, we can do this.We are America. We don\u2019t settle. We aspire.Let\u2019s get to work.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/were-going-to-create-a-21st-century-care-and-early-childhood-education-workforce-e5fc4c066fbd?source=user_profile---------33----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Good afternoon.I want to thank the Colonial Early Education Program here at the Colwyck Center for hosting us.I just met with Sarah Johnson, and her 3-year-old son, Noah, who is a student here.She said the program does wonders, helping Noah learn his letters and numbers, socialize with other kids, and understand his emotions and develop his personality.But like so many parents, she's worried.About her job as a dental assistant, and noticing changes in Noah's behavior since he hasn't been in school since March.

Biden knows how hard it is to raise a family and to care for a sick family member. And, he knows how hard it is for millions of Americans who are just trying to make ends meet. The pandemic has laid bare just how hard it is for people in this country to find access to quality caregiving they need for themselves, or to juggle the responsibilities of working and also caring for family members. People in nursing homes have been hit especially hard by the coronavirus, shining a bright light on the fact that many would prefer to be in a home or community based setting. And, many parents are struggling to find child care while they go to their essential jobs, or find themselves as 24\/7 caregivers trying to keep their children safe and learning while working remotely. Other parents are caring for their kids, while worrying about how they will make ends meet after having hours cut or losing their jobs. And, at the same time, professional caregivers have either lost their jobs or continue to work while putting their lives at risk without sufficient pay and benefits. President Trump\u2019s failure to take action to control the coronavirus has worsened all of these challenges facing families across the country. Even before the pandemic, our country was experiencing a caregiving crisis. Some care needs were going untended. Other care needs were filled by Americans serving as unpaid caregivers lacking the financial support or respite care they needed, and sometimes putting their careers on hold. Often, families made caregiving decisions that came with great financial, professional, physical and emotional costs. Caregivers and early childhood educators , disproportionately women of color , have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long. Biden believes that if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying, and we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, training and education opportunities for certification, and dignity of caregiving workers and educators. Biden\u2019s economic recovery plan won\u2019t just build back our economy to the way it was before, but build it back better , including by building a robust 21st century caregiving and education workforce. As a first step, Biden will immediately provide states, tribal, and local governments with the fiscal relief they need to keep workers employed and keep vital public services running, including direct care and child care services. Once we are able to move from relief to recovery, Biden will make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country , to make child care more affordable and accessible for working families, and to make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to have quality, affordable home- or community-based care. And, he is proposing to give caregiving workers and early childhood educators a raise and stronger benefits, treating them as the professionals they are. These steps will mean families will be able to afford better, more productive care and early education for their loved ones. They will also have a significant jobs impact: This plan, combined with Biden\u2019s proposal to provide families with up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, will put 3 million Americans to work in new care and education jobs, and increase overall employment by about 5 million after taking into account the economic impacts of increased labor force participation after unpaid caregivers , disproportionately women , are freed up to pursue paid careers if they so choose.Biden will:The plan will cost $775 billion over 10 years and will be paid for by rolling back unproductive and unequal tax breaks for real estate investors with incomes over $400,000 and taking steps to increase tax compliance for high-income earners. This plan builds on Biden\u2019s proposals to support informal caregivers , family members or loved ones who do this work unpaid, including a $5,000 tax credit for informal caregivers, Social Security credits for people who care for their loved ones, and professional and peer support for caregivers of wounded, injured, or ill active duty service members and veterans. EXPAND ACCESS TO DIGNIFIED CARE FOR OLDER AMERICANS AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES Biden will help ease the financial burden on families caring for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities and reduce unnecessary and costly hospitalizations, while providing people who need care with better, more dignified services and supports that meet their specific needs and personal choices. Biden will allocate $450 billion to give more people the choice to receive care at home or in supportive community situations, or to have that choice for their loved ones. He will help states offer cost-effective options for affordable primary and preventive care, and affordable support services like help with meals, transportation, home safety, and quality day programs for older Americans. This commitment will reduce health expenditures, help more Americans avoid unnecessary and expensive hospitalizations, and result in an expansion of the caregiving and community health workforce by roughly 1.5 million jobs. Specifically, Biden will:It is also just too hard to figure out how to get care when you need it. As part of his proposal, Biden will work with states to set up a simpler way for Americans searching for caregiving help to go online, find out what financial support they might be eligible for based on their income, and identify potential caregivers. MAKE HIGH-QUALITY CHILD CARE AFFORDABLE AND PRESCHOOL UNIVERSAL The pandemic has highlighted what has always been true: child care and early learning are essential to many Americans, providing a nurturing environment for children to learn and grow and allowing parents and guardians the choice to pursue careers and contribute to the economy while supporting their families. The pandemic has also reminded parents around the country just how valuable caregivers and educators are , and how challenging and important their jobs are. Even before the pandemic, millions of parents struggled to find a space for their child in a quality care and educational setting, keeping parents , primarily mothers , out of the workforce or causing them to settle for lower-paying jobs that allowed them time to provide their own child care. And now, many more parents are worrying how they will educate and care for their children while they work, while schools and child care providers are facing extreme financial challenges and uncertainty. Many child care facilities have lost much of their revenues and are struggling to pay their bills and stay afloat. Providers who already operate on extremely thin margins are spending money on personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies to keep children and early childhood educators safe, while facing falling revenues as they serve fewer children to make it easier to physically distance. If they don\u2019t get help soon, a sizable portion of child care providers might have to close their doors permanently and as many as half of all child care slots could disappear. The danger of a radical decline in the child care sector will increase the challenges parents face as they seek to return to work, make it harder for the economy to recover, and force many early childhood educators , who are disproportionately women of color , out of their jobs. President Trump has failed to effectively respond to the caregiving crisis for months, while exacerbating it by letting the virus continue to spread. He should immediately work with Congress to provide emergency relief to save child care centers and family child care providers and support child care workers. This urgent action is critical to investing in the care and education of our youngest children and ensuring that parents and guardians have the support they need to return to work when it is safe to do so. Beyond addressing the pandemic-driven child care crisis, Biden will build our child care infrastructure back better for the long-term, including by making high-quality child care affordable and preschool universal for three- and four-year-olds. His plan will cultivate the potential of young children, provide parents , primarily mothers , with career opportunities and economic security, create an additional 1.5 million new, good, early education jobs, and improve the existing jobs for the essential workers who educate our young children. Biden will:Not only will these investments create jobs for new early educators, Biden\u2019s plan to support our public schools will also create new jobs by tripling Title I funding, fully-funding IDEA, funding community schools, and doubling the number of psychologists, counselors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals in our schools so our kids get the mental health care they need. BUILD SAFE CHILD CARE FACILITIES Our nation faced a massive shortage of child care facilities before the pandemic, and the shortage has only intensified since then. One survey found that, even before COVID-19 hit, 43% of parents had difficulty locating child care, and many more struggled to find convenient, affordable care. This shortage stresses parents and guardians, hurts family pocketbooks, and disadvantages children in areas with insufficient child care options. Biden will address this shortage by accelerating the construction and renovation of safe and developmentally appropriate child care facilities in communities and in workplaces, so parents do not have to search in vain for a suitable child care option. Specifically, Biden will create a new child care construction tax credit to encourage businesses to build child care facilities at places of work. Employers will receive 50% of the first $1 million of construction costs per facility, so that employees can enjoy the peace of mind and convenience that comes with on-site child care. At the same time, he\u2019ll make direct investments in building new child-care facilities and upgrading existing facilities around the country that are not accessible for people with disabilities, or safe or developmentally appropriate for young children who are especially vulnerable to environmental contaminants like lead and mold, and to safety hazards like electrical outlets. If his tax credit is fully utilized, and coupled with direct investments, these policies will lead to tens of thousands of new child care facilities across the country. All infrastructure investments will require high standards for the quality of the facilities, including ensuring they are healthy, energy efficient, climate resilient, developmentally appropriate places to learn and accessible for children with disabilities. And, they will require high labor standards for the people who build the facilities, creating thousands of middle-class construction jobs with a choice to join a union. REWARD CAREGIVERS AND EDUCATORS WITH THE BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS THEY DESERVE While we rely on our nation\u2019s caregivers and educators to play essential roles in the lives of our loved ones, their current pay and benefits are abysmal. Caregivers and early childhood educators , who are disproportionately women and people of color , are poorly compensated. Direct support professionals and child care workers earn on average less than $12 an hour and $25,000 annually. This low pay contributes to extremely high rates of turnover in the care workforce, which hurts these workers and those for whom they care. Biden will maintain and grow a diverse, talented care and education workforce by providing increased pay and benefits, and access to collective bargaining, training and education, and career ladders. He will ensure these workers receive:","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/the-biden-plan-for-mobilizing-american-talent-and-heart-to-create-a-21st-century-caregiving-and-af5ba2a2dfeb?source=user_profile---------34----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Joe Biden has taken care of aging parents, and he's been a single parent.

He is making a push to block $25 billion for testing and contact tracing from the next package of pandemic relief , critical resources that are supported by congressional Republicans, and which support the most proven and effective tools for battling COVID-19.President Trump\u2019s position defies both logic and humanity. The sole rationale seems to be that, in the words of his own advisors, he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to be distracted by\u201d a tragedy still gripping the United States , even as the rest of the developed world has managed largely to contain the worst of the threat. It is a morally, economically, and scientifically indefensible stance, which Congress should flatly reject.With the President having turned his back on the problem, people are looking to Congress for the support they need to keep their heads above water. As the House and Senate prepare to negotiate the next package of pandemic relief, it is imperative that President Trump and Congress deliver a lifeline to those who need it most: working families and small businesses. Due in large part to the President\u2019s inept response to the crisis, tens of millions of workers still depend on unemployment benefits to make ends meet , and nearly one in ten American small businesses shut down in the week following July 4th alone. The need for substantial, immediate relief is beyond debate , we are plainly a nation in crisis.The next phase of COVID-19 relief must be guided by four commonsense principles:First, all necessary resources to fight the pandemic should be authorized immediately , without delay. If President Trump wants to block them, make him use his veto pen to deny testing, tracing, PPE, and other resources to the American people.Second, not one penny should be spent on cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans. The White House has floated at least three proposals to cut taxes for the super-wealthy and corporations. Congress should reject all of them.Congressional Republicans should focus on ending the outrageous tax loophole for hedge fund investors and real estate developers that was hidden away in the CARES Act , not ending enhanced unemployment benefits for millions of Americans who lost their livelihoods due to the crisis, and who are trying to make ends meet until they are able to get back to work.Third, Congress should mandate that any relief offered to struggling companies must not be used to outsource American jobs. COVID-19 funds, paid for by taxpayers to benefit the nation, should not be spent on displacing American workers. Congress has the power to ensure that loans go only to businesses that will deploy the funds to hire or protect American workers. They should exercise that power without delay.Finally, the next relief package should provide enough resources for our governors and mayors to deal with the crisis locally , including full funding to prevent teacher layoffs and help schools reopen safely this fall. Last week, I called on Congress to pass an emergency education package that would give schools in every district the resources they need to upgrade their buildings, implement sanitation protocols, and otherwise give themselves the best possible shot to get students back into the classroom safely. School reopenings should be a local decision based on local circumstances , but mayors and governors won\u2019t have a chance if we don\u2019t provide safety guidelines and resources on a national scale. This plan must be part of bold state and local fiscal relief that goes beyond schools to fully protect health coverage, help address lost revenues due to the crisis, prevent hundreds of thousands of additional layoffs, and ensure the delivery of critical health and public safety services.I urge Congress to act immediately , and President Trump to sign a relief package , with these three principles in mind. The American people are counting on their leaders to step up, and families and small businesses cannot afford for the relief they desperately need to once again be diminished, delayed, or diverted to the President\u2019s wealthy friends in the midst of this intensifying crisis.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/my-statement-on-coronavirus-relief-negotiations-59e343a2f23e?source=user_profile---------35----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Morning after morning, Americans are waking to the heart-wrenching news of escalating infection and death totals , and an economic crisis exacerbated by Donald Trump's catastrophic failure to get the virus under control.How is President Trump responding?

I mean, literally.President Obama:Those words didn\u2019t come out of our mouths, while we were in office.Vice President Biden:I don\u2019t understand his inability to get a sense of what people are going through. He just can\u2019t, he can\u2019t relate in any way.President Obama:Well, and one of the things that I have always known about you Joe, it\u2019s the reason why I wanted you to be my vice president and the reason why you were so effective , it all starts with being able to relate. If you can sit down with a family and see your own family in them. The struggles that you\u2019ve gone through, or your parents went through, or your kids are going through. If you can connect those struggles to somebody else\u2019s struggles, then you\u2019re going to work hard for them. And that\u2019s always, what\u2019s motivated you to get into public service.President Obama:When we came into office, even before inauguration, we had seen a historic financial crisis, irresponsibility on Wall Street had spread out to Main Street. We had to move fast, not just in a hundred days. We had to move in the first month to get the Recovery Act passed. We\u2019re now in a situation where not only we\u2019ve got an economic crisis, but we also have a public health crisis to boot. Tell me a little bit about how you\u2019re seeing the current economic crisis and how you\u2019re thinking about the economy.Vice President Biden:Well, Mr. President, there\u2019s three pieces that I see. One, we have got to sustain and keep people from going under forever. There\u2019s already 10,000 businesses that are not likely to open again, and a significant number of small businesses and minority businesses. Number two, when they\u2019re able to come back, they not only are able to keep their folks employed on a payroll, but they\u2019re able to cover overhead. They\u2019re able to cover the additional expenses. For example, the idea you can open without social distancing, mask, tests, and all these things that cost a lot of money.President Obama:Those are added costs for small businesses.Vice President Biden:They\u2019re added costs. And they should be able to have that added cost to be able to stay open for the good of the country. But the next stage of this is going to be, if we\u2019re able to if the stimulus is able to keep people afloat, then we have to deal with recovery. And the recovery is building back, but not just building back , as you\u2019ve been talking about and I\u2019ve been talking about , but building back better. We have to change the way in which we deal with allowing people an opportunity to make a living.President Obama:Right.Vice President Biden:That includes childcare. That includes making significant investments in infrastructure, so people can make a, not only a living wage, but a union wage. Making sure we have build up an entire new public health system, and making sure everybody has health care. And well, now we have a chance we can add a public option now.President Obama:Right.Vice President Biden:But this guy\u2019s in court, in the middle of a pandemic, trying to take away the protection for a hundred million people who have preexisting conditions. I don\u2019t think he has any sense of empathy or any , I don\u2019t think he can associate at all.President Obama:You and I had experience dealing with health crises , public health crisis , and in each instance, what you and I understood and why I have so much confidence that you\u2019re going to be able to deal with a COVID in the way that other countries, with our kinds of resources that are dealing with it right now, which is smartly. I have confidence that you\u2019re going to actually listen to the experts.Vice President Biden:Yeah.President Obama:And you\u2019re going to pay attention to the science, and you\u2019re not going to quit on trying to actually bend down the curve of disease and transmission rates.Vice President Biden:When we left office, you had set up a pandemic office within the White House. We had people from the CDC, 44 people in China. We knew pandemic diseases , this wasn\u2019t going to be the only one that ever occurred.President Obama:Correct. And the goal was to create an early warning system around the world.Vice President Biden:Bingo.President Obama:by creating international cooperation so that when you saw it coming, you had time to prepare.Vice President Biden:Right.President Obama:I know how deeply you care about American families and that any loss of life that is preventable, if you\u2019re president of the United States, it\u2019s your job to try to prevent it. And one of the things that I think you said that\u2019s so important, and you understood, we understood this during the financial crisis, you can\u2019t separate out the public health crisis from the economy. If you want the economy growing again, people have to feel safe.Vice President Biden:What you did, and what all great presidents do, is they not only lead, they persuade. I think what you did with Obamacare , the ACA , and what you wanted to do, is to have a public option. It\u2019s the quickest, fastest way to get everyone covered. I remember when Beau was toward the end and the only person I told the detail all the time was you, because you had a right to know exactly what my and he only had months left to go. And I used to sit there and watch him in the bed and in pain, and dying and glioblastoma. And I thought to myself, what would happen if his insurance company was able to come in, which they could have done before we passed Obamacare, and said, \u201cYou have out run your insurance. You\u2019ve outlived it. Suffer the last five months of your life in peace. You\u2019re on your own.\u201d All the things that it did, that it was so profound an impact on people, it was like it took them awhile until they started to take it away, to realize what was happening.President Obama:Look, I mean, you and I both know what it\u2019s like to have somebody you love get really sick. And in some cases to lose somebody, but that loss is compounded when you see the stress on their faces, because they\u2019re worried that they\u2019re being a burden on their families. They\u2019re worried about whether the insurance is gonna cover the treatments that they need. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of what we got done. 20 million people have health insurance that didn\u2019t have it because of what we did. But you remember when we were talking about this, I always used to say the Affordable Care Act , Obamacare , it\u2019s like a starter house. It\u2019s the first house you get. And it\u2019s not the end of the process, it\u2019s the beginning of the process.Vice President Biden:You know, we used to say that, you know, this is a starter house. Remember I used to say? It\u2019s like social security when it was first passed.President Obama:That\u2019s exactly right.Vice President Biden:Social security was first passed was this narrow.President Obama:Very narrow.Vice President Biden:Social security now.President Obama:And you kept on building.Vice President Biden:It kept building it out.President Obama:Making it a better.Vice President Biden:Well, it\u2019s a little that starter house, they got inside the house and they realized, \u201cWow, God, this is better than being out in the cold.\u201d That\u2019s number one. But number two. And then they said, \u201cBut I got a guy out there banging down the house, trying to take down a house. And I didn\u2019t realize the reason I had this house.\u201d And what\u2019s happening now is that you have so many people now, I can\u2019t think of any time since the flu in 1918.President Obama:1918, yeah.Vice President Biden:That the public had , I don\u2019t know then, but it appears , had to be totally, thoroughly aware of how vulnerable they were.President Obama:Right.Vice President Biden:Now you have people going, \u201cOh my Lord.\u201dPresident Obama:And look, you\u2019re absolutely right. That it is hard to fathom anybody wanting to take away people\u2019s health care in the middle of a major public health crisis.Vice President Biden:And offer nothing.President Obama:At a time when unemployment is in double digits. There, there\u2019s another issue that\u2019s been on our minds and was on our minds during my presidency. And that is the issue of race in America. And how communities of color are policed, how you know, police are interacting and, and oftentimes acting in ways that are racially biased. And after the George Floyd tragedy, what we have seen is this extraordinary mobilization across the country of people of every walk of life, every race, every creed, who say, \u201cWe\u2019re past time to do something about this. We understand we\u2019re not going to fix it all in one day, but we\u2019re going to take this seriously, and we\u2019re going to start now.\u201d And we had experiences with this during my administration. Our response was not to ignore those problems. Our response was we had a 21st century policing task force that we put together that drew police chiefs, academics, young members of Black Lives Matter all in a single conversation. And we arrived at a series of recommendations that are still pertinent to this day.Vice President Biden:We got through the notion that if a police department was engaging in a practice and a pattern that was in violation of basic civil rights and civil liberties, the Justice Department of the United States of America , the federal government , would intervene and stop it.President Obama:Right.Vice President Biden:Well, you authorized to put in place a whole range of things that would increase what most cops , the guys I grew up with became cops, firefighters, and, you know, or priests. I mean, I wasn\u2019t qualified to do any one of them. The point was that they know they need more guidance.President Obama:And I think this is a process that we\u2019re all going through and we\u2019re all learning. And something that I\u2019ve always admired about you, Joe, is your willingness to listen and learn. It is a sign of leadership when you are willing to hear other people\u2019s experiences. It has to do with communities that have systematically been under-invested in. It has to do with hiring. And the fact that, you know, if you get on the phone applying for a job, send in your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, if your name is John, you might get called back. If your name\u2019s Jamal, you might not.Vice President Biden:It\u2019s about to be able to be able to accumulate wealth. It\u2019s about being able to be in a position , you know better than I do, but I\u2019ve watched it my whole life working in the city , Black entrepreneurs are as successful as white entrepreneurs, given a shot in the same circumstance.President Obama:We\u2019re in a moment right now , my daughters, your granddaughters have been involved in this moment.Vice President Biden:Best friends.President Obama:in which this next generation is saying, \u201cWe have beliefs in all people being equal. And we don\u2019t see that operating out there. We\u2019re going to do something about it.\u201dVice President Biden:Yep.President Obama:And I think the key right now, and this is why I have so much confidence in your administration, wanting to be a partner in harnessing that energy and bringing about concrete reforms, concrete steps, not just in the criminal justice system, not just with respect to policing, but also with respect to investment, jobs, business development, is going to send a signal of decency and regard and concern and community around the country , because policy is important, laws are important, budgets are important. But you know, what\u2019s important also is, is what kind of values are you communicating?Vice President Biden:Bingo.President Obama:And if we want to create a world that we want our kids and grandkids to grow up in, then we\u2019re going to have to do a whole lot better than we\u2019re doing.Vice President Biden:We got a hell of an opportunity.President Obama:And everybody\u2019s going to have to be involved.Vice President Biden:We\u2019ve got a hell of an opportunity, right? Because look what\u2019s happened, you\u2019ve got 70% of the American people saying we got to do something about this, right. I\u2019m not just talking about police.President Obama:Yeah. And that\u2019s a big change from when you and I were in office.Vice President Biden:Exactly. No, it\u2019s a gigantic size. And let me tell you my thesis of why there\u2019s two ways in which presidents motivate people , by doing something really ennobling, important, and people go, \u201cOh!\u201d, or to do something really bad. This guy has generated a sense out there, that people are waking up to, that he ran by deliberately dividing people from the moment he came down that escalator. And I think people are now going, \u201cI don\u2019t want my kid growing up that way\u201d.President Obama:You know what it\u2019s like, as much as anybody, to be in the White House during a crisis. You know what it\u2019s like to have to get laws passed through Congress. You know what it\u2019s like to deal with foreign leaders, you know what it\u2019s like and how lonely it can be to make tough decisions , where not every decision is going to be perfect, but you gotta make them and take responsibility for it. I\u2019ve seen you with families that have gone through tragedies, and the thing I\u2019ve got confidence in Joe, is your heart and your character. And the fact that you are going to be able to reassemble the kind of government that cares about people and brings people together.President Obama:And for all the specific policies that we\u2019re going to need, more than anything, it\u2019s just that basic decency and an understanding about what\u2019s best in America. That I think people are going to be hungry for. Looking forward to working with you, to do whatever I can to help. And I have confidence in your commitment to making sure that we seize this moment that we have right now.Vice President Biden:Thank you, and I have faith in the American people.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/my-socially-distanced-conversation-with-president-obama-78511280714a?source=user_profile---------31----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"I sat down with my friend President Barack Obama to discuss the significant moment we're in, who we are as a nation, and how we can build back better.Vice President Biden:Can you imagine standing up when you were president, saying, 'It's not my responsibility'? 'I take no responsibility'? I mean, literally.President Obama:Those words didn't come out of our mouths, while we were in office.Vice President Biden:I don't understand his inability to get a sense of what people are going through. He just can't, he can't relate in any way.President Obama:Well, and one of the things that I have always known about you Joe, it's the reason why I wanted you to be my vice president and the reason why you were so effective , it all starts with being able to relate. If you can sit down with a family and see your own family in them. The struggles that you've gone through, or your parents went through, or your kids are going through. If you can connect those struggles to somebody else's struggles, then you're going to work hard for them. And that's always, what's motivated you to get into public service.President Obama:When we came into office, even before inauguration, we had seen a historic financial crisis, irresponsibility on Wall Street had spread out to Main Street. We had to move fast, not just in a hundred days. We had to move in the first month to get the Recovery Act passed. We're now in a situation where not only we've got an economic crisis, but we also have a public health crisis to boot. Tell me a little bit about how you're seeing the current economic crisis and how you're thinking about the economy.Vice President Biden:Well, Mr. President, there's three pieces that I see. One, we have got to sustain and keep people from going under forever. There's already 10,000 businesses that are not likely to open again, and a significant number of small businesses and minority businesses. Number two, when they're able to come back, they not only are able to keep their folks employed on a payroll, but they're able to cover overhead. They're able to cover the additional expenses. For example, the idea you can open without social distancing, mask, tests, and all these things that cost a lot of money.President Obama:Those are added costs for small businesses.Vice President Biden:They're added costs. And they should be able to have that added cost to be able to stay open for the good of the country. But the next stage of this is going to be, if we're able to if the stimulus is able to keep people afloat, then we have to deal with recovery. And the recovery is building back, but not just building back , as you've been talking about and I've been talking about , but building back better. We have to change the way in which we deal with allowing people an opportunity to make a living.President Obama:Right.Vice President Biden:That includes childcare. That includes making significant investments in infrastructure, so people can make a, not only a living wage, but a union wage. Making sure we have build up an entire new public health system, and making sure everybody has health care. And well, now we have a chance we can add a public option now.President Obama:Right.Vice President Biden:But this guy's in court, in the middle of a pandemic, trying to take away the protection for a hundred million people who have preexisting conditions. I don't think he has any sense of empathy or any , I don't think he can associate at all.President Obama:You and I had experience dealing with health crises , public health crisis , and in each instance, what you and I understood and why I have so much confidence that you're going to be able to deal with a COVID in the way that other countries, with our kinds of resources that are dealing with it right now, which is smartly. I have confidence that you're going to actually listen to the experts.Vice President Biden:Yeah.President Obama:And you're going to pay attention to the science, and you're not going to quit on trying to actually bend down the curve of disease and transmission rates.Vice President Biden:When we left office, you had set up a pandemic office within the White House. We had people from the CDC, 44 people in China. We knew pandemic diseases , this wasn't going to be the only one that ever occurred.President Obama:Correct. And the goal was to create an early warning system around the world.Vice President Biden:Bingo.President Obama:by creating international cooperation so that when you saw it coming, you had time to prepare.Vice President Biden:Right.President Obama:I know how deeply you care about American families and that any loss of life that is preventable, if you're president of the United States, it's your job to try to prevent it. And one of the things that I think you said that's so important, and you understood, we understood this during the financial crisis, you can't separate out the public health crisis from the economy.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB267202028","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-07-26","SpeechTitle":"My Statement on the 30th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act","RawText":"Thirty years ago today, our nation moved closer to the fulfillment of its foundational promise by passing the Americans with Disabilities Act. For the estimated 61 million Americans now living with a disability, the ADA has been a critical source of opportunity, participation, self-sufficiency, and respect , a triumph of American civil rights.I will never forget the leadership and persistence of my friends, Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Ted Kennedy, Congressman Major Owens, and Congressman Tony Coelho, who teamed up to create the ADA against long odds and determined opposition. Nor will I forget the moment just after it passed, when Senator Harkin delivered a speech from the Senate floor in American Sign Language as a tribute to his older brother, Frank, who was deaf. For tens of millions of American families, this work could not be more personal.I was immensely proud to cosponsor the ADA, which was forged through fearless advocacy and tough bipartisan negotiations , a Democratic bill signed by George H.W. Bush, a Republican President. It rose above the foundation laid by other landmark laws I had the honor of helping to pass, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975, and the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988. And its legacy was furthered by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which finally barred health insurers from instituting lifetime caps on benefits , and denying coverage altogether , for Americans living with disabilities.Today, President Trump threatens that progress, consistently disparaging Americans with disabilities with his rhetoric and actions. His administration has attempted to undermine the ADA by making it harder for Americans with disabilities to exercise their civil rights by filing claims. And he has repeatedly tried to gut Medicaid and repeal the Affordable Care Act , two of the most important safeguards of the health and independence of Americans with disabilities.If I have the honor of becoming President, every policy I pursue , from rebuilding our middle class, to fighting climate change, to achieving universal health coverage , will be created with the full inclusion and dignity of Americans with disabilities in mind. As we seek to recover from a devastating public health crisis that is disproportionately impacting people with disabilities, it is more important than ever that we fulfill the promise of the ADA and build a more equal and inclusive society. My comprehensive Plan for Full Participation and Equality for People with Disabilities seeks to do just that through a broad sweep of laws, policies, and actions designed to uplift dignity and opportunity.The plan creates a senior White House position dedicated to asserting the interests of Americans with disabilities in every area of policy development , ensuring that disability rights are embedded in everything we pursue. We will make bold investments in home and community care through Medicaid to help states clear the backlog of 800,000 people who need support, but can\u2019t get it. We will give a major, long-overdue raise to the direct care workforce. And we will guarantee access to high quality, affordable health care , including mental health care , for every American.My plan also eliminates employment barriers for workers with disabilities , phasing out the subminimum wage and creating new job opportunities for Americans with disabilities. We will fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, invest in accessible child care, and provide federal support to ease students with disabilities\u2019 transitions from high school to higher education and employment opportunities. And we will invest in accessible, affordable, and integrated housing and transportation; eliminate the Supplemental Security Income marriage penalty and other provisions that prevent Americans with disabilities from achieving economic security; and use every tool of American diplomacy to advance disability rights on a global scale.Finally , and most urgently , we will take immediate steps to support Americans with disabilities grappling with the coronavirus pandemic: outlawing the rationing of scarce medical resources based on a patient\u2019s disability; aggressively enforcing non-discrimination laws; making sure that people living in the community have access to PPE when it is most critically needed; expanding remote mental health and food and medicine delivery programs; launching an emergency paid leave program; and investing in accessible technology to meet the needs of students with disabilities.Thirty years on, we still have work to do to realize the full aspiration of the ADA. We need to ensure that every American has the chance to live independently, contribute their talents to our society, and go through life free from the burden of discriminatory systems and practices. I look forward to working together with the disability community to bring us closer to those goals , and finally deliver on the promise of the ADA.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/my-statement-on-the-30th-anniversary-of-the-americans-with-disabilities-act-7cb340cfe223?source=user_profile---------30----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Thirty years ago today, our nation moved closer to the fulfillment of its foundational promise by passing the Americans with Disabilities Act.

{"SpeechID":"MEJB277202027","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-07-27","SpeechTitle":"The Biden Agenda for Women","RawText":"Joe Biden is going to build our country back better after this economic crisis and that includes ensuring we get closer to full inclusion of and equality for women. Women , particularly women of color , have never had a fair shot to get ahead in this country. Today, too many women are struggling to make ends meet and support their families, and are worried about the economic future for their children. This was true before the COVID-19 crisis, but the current global health crisis has exacerbated these realities for women.For Biden, it\u2019s a simple proposition: his daughter is entitled to the same rights and opportunities as his sons. He believes every issue is a women\u2019s issue , health care, the economy, education, national security , but women are also uniquely and disproportionately impacted by many policies. As President, Biden will pursue an aggressive and comprehensive plan to further women\u2019s economic and physical security and ensure that women can fully exercise their civil rights. Biden will:Biden will start on day one of his Administration leading by example, making sure his political appointees, including his Cabinet, and our entire federal workforce look like the country they serve. Biden has committed to selecting a woman to be his Vice President and an African American woman to be his first nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, but his commitment to ensuring women help lead his Administration does not end there. As President, Biden will nominate and appoint people who look like the country they serve. He will reissue and mandate strict compliance with the Obama-Biden executive order to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce, which President Trump has ignored. He will modify it to mandate that Cabinet agencies and other executive branch agencies work with federal employee unions to create and implement a diversity and inclusion plan for the federal workforce. And, he will provide more training and mentoring opportunities to improve retention, and collect better data about who is applying for federal service positions as well as being promoted.Biden will also structure his Administration to ensure women\u2019s issues remain at the forefront of policy efforts. Biden knows that addressing the challenges faced by women and girls is more than just a campaign promise , it\u2019s an imperative if the Administration is going to succeed in its broader efforts to make sure the government and economy work for all Americans. Biden will ensure that his administration aggressively protects the rights and addresses the unique needs of all women, including Black women, Latina women, Native women, Asian American and Pacific Islander women, women with disabilities, and lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer women. The Obama-Biden Administration created the White House Council on Women and Girls to make sure the federal government was doing its best to tackle issues like equal pay, paid family leave, and poverty in an effective manner. The Trump Administration then disbanded it and put nothing in its place. Biden will create a White House Council on Gender Equality, chaired by a senior member of the Executive Office of the President tasked solely with guiding and coordinating government policy that impacts women and girls, such as economic policy, health care, racial justice, gender-based violence, and foreign policy.As President, Biden will work with advocates across the country to pass the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) so women\u2019s rights are once and for all explicitly enshrined in our Constitution. Biden co-sponsored the ERA nine times. As President, he will work with advocates across the country to enshrine gender equality in our Constitution. Now that Virginia has become the 38th state to ratify the ERA, Biden will proudly advocate for Congress to recognize that 3\/4th of states have ratified the amendment and take action so our Constitution makes clear that any government-related discrimination against women is unconstitutional.IMPROVE ECONOMIC SECURIT,Women hold only 32% of the wealth men have accumulated and women of color only hold pennies on every dollar a white man holds. Women in the workforce, on average, earn less than men do. When they start a business, they have less access to capital, and have to dip into their personal finances. Only 56% of women ages 18\u201334 are able to save, compared to 70% of men. And women , primarily Black women , hold two-thirds of the nation\u2019s student debt, both exacerbating and resulting from racial and gender wealth gaps. This is especially detrimental for the over 4 in 10 mothers , especially women of color , who are sole or primary breadwinners for their families.Biden will tackle this wealth gap, including by fighting for equal pay, ending other forms of workplace discrimination and harassment, encouraging and supporting women entrepreneurs and small business owners, making education and training more affordable, providing pathways into high-paying professions, expanding access to paid leave and child care, and strengthening union organizing and collective bargaining.Fighting for Equal Pa,For every dollar a man makes, the average woman makes 82 cents , with Black women earning 62 cents, Native women earning 57 cents, and Latinas earning 54 cents. For a woman who works full time, year round, that\u2019s a gap of more than $10,000 annually. This gap adds up, on average, to over $400,000 throughout a forty-year career and roughly $1 million for women of color. The gender wage gap starts when young women first start working and continues for older women even into retirement, no matter the woman\u2019s education level or occupation. It can exacerbate other biases, with a magnified impact for women of color, transgender women, women with disabilities, and immigrant women.The Lilly Ledbetter Act Fair Pay Act was the first piece of legislation the Obama-Biden Administration enacted, and Biden will continue to prioritize closing wage gaps and ending paycheck discrimination. He strongly supports Senator Patty Murray and Congresswoman DeLauro\u2019s Paycheck Fairness Act, which codifies and expands critical Obama-Biden protections for workers\u2019 paychecks. He will build on it as President and protect workers against retaliation for discussing wages. Today, one in four private-sector workers are in a workplace where they can\u2019t talk about their current wage rate with other employees without fear of retribution from their employers. Many states and the District of Columbia outlaw employers from retaliating against workers who talk about pay. Under a Biden presidency, it will be national. Biden will also:Ending Other Forms of Workplace Discrimination and Harassmen,Investing in Women-Owned Small Businesse,Women start businesses at two times the rate of men and now represent 42% of the nation\u2019s businesses. But, they still raise much less capital , with only about 2% of all venture capital funds going to women-owned businesses , and are more likely to rely on personal funds. Biden will ensure women-owned small businesses have the capital, technical assistance, mentorship, and support they need to ensure they are able to grow. For example, Biden will:Expand Access to Education and Trainin,Biden will ensure that women receive educational opportunities to unleash their full potential to grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class. He will aggressively enforce Title IX protections to ensure that women and girls receive full access to these opportunities, from admissions to financial aid to sports. In addition, he will:Expand Pay and Benefits for Jobs Disproportionately Filled by Wome,Biden will focus on improving women\u2019s economic security by expanding the pay and benefits for underpaid jobs that are disproportionately filled by women, starting by:EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND TACKLE HEALTH DISPARITIE,The Affordable Care Act was , and still is , a big deal, especially for women. Because of Obamacare, millions of women gained the peace of mind that comes with insurance. And, over 100 million people no longer have to worry that an insurance company will deny coverage or charge higher premiums just because they have a pre-existing condition like high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, or even pregnancy. Insurance companies can no longer charge someone more because they are a woman , a practice which costs women $1 billion more than men annually. Young adults can get coverage through their parents\u2019 insurance plans until age 26. Insurance plans have to cover essential benefits like maternity care. And, insurance plans now have to cover critical recommended preventive services free of charge.But now, in the middle of a pandemic, Trump is trying to strip away all health care protections for the millions of Americans who depend on the Affordable Care Act.As President, Biden will protect and build on Obamacare , to expand access, lower costs, and make quality, affordable health care a right for all. Read Biden\u2019s full plan for building on Obamacare with a new public option at joebiden.com\/healthcare.Maternal Mortalit,Before the pandemic, the U.S. already had one of the highest rates of deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth relative to other developed countries, especially among Black women, who were 2.5 times more likely to die from pregnancy complications than non-Hispanic white women, and Native women, who from 2011 to 2016 were 2.3 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than were white women. California came up with a strategy that halved the state\u2019s maternal death rate. As President, Biden will reduce our unacceptably high maternal mortality rate, starting by taking the California strategy nationwide.Maternal mortality is just one example of the types of health disparities that Biden will direct his Secretary of Health and Human Services to address.Reproductive Healt,The Affordable Care Act made historic progress ensuring access to free preventive care, including contraception. The Biden Plan will build on that progress. Vice President Biden supports repealing the Hyde Amendment because health care is a right that should not be dependent on one\u2019s zip code or income. And, the public option will cover contraception and a woman\u2019s constitutional right under Roe v. Wade. Biden will also:Health Care Protections for Al,HELP WOMEN NAVIGATE WORK AND FAMIL,Biden has taken care of aging parents, and he\u2019s been a single parent. He knows how hard it is to raise a family and to care for a sick family member. And, he knows how hard it is for millions of Americans who are just trying to make ends meet. The pandemic has laid bare just how hard it is for women in this country to find access to quality caregiving they need for themselves, or to juggle the responsibilities of working and also caring for family members.In the United States, women overwhelmingly take on the responsibilities of caring for their families, and thus are disproportionately impacted by the gaps in our caregiving system. Only one in six American workers typically has access to paid family leave if they need it. Black and Latino individuals are even less likely to be able to take paid leave. And, when parents are forced to choose between their jobs and caregiving responsibilities, the costs are great , both to them and to the economy. Women who need to work part-time on average earn lower hourly wages and benefits. And, the lack of family friendly policies is causing many women to leave the workforce completely.These decisions have real costs for families. A recent study found that a woman in her twenties who left the workforce for five years to care for her young children earns nearly 20% less over her lifetime. A similar study estimated that the absence of paid family and medical leave costs workers and their families roughly $22.5 billion a year in wages. Consequences can be especially severe for women of color who are more likely to be both breadwinners and caregivers, all while earning lower-pay to cushion the loss of work.Biden will make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country. He will make child care more affordable and accessible for working families, and make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to have quality, affordable home- or community-based care. And, he will ensure all workers have access to up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, can earn 7 days of paid sick leave, and have fair and flexible schedules so they can more easily manage their families and careers.Biden will:Read Joe Biden\u2019s full plan for Mobilizing American Talent and Heart to Create a 21st Century Caregiving and Education Workforce at joebiden.com\/caregiving.Biden will also ensure women and all workers have comprehensive paid leave and fair and flexible schedules.END VIOLENCE AGAINST WOME,One of the driving forces throughout Biden\u2019s career has been fighting back against abuses of power , whether economic or physical power. That force motivated him to write and champion the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). He wrote and spearheaded the groundbreaking VAWA in 1990 at a time when few in Washington cared about domestic violence and sexual assault. He lifted survivors\u2019 voices, won over the skeptics, and pushed until the bill became law in 1994. The Act created a national hotline for victims. It funded shelters and crisis centers. It trained law enforcement in communities across the country so they were better prepared to investigate violence against women and support survivors of violence. And, it helped change the way Americans understand and fundamentally view violence against women.Since then, Biden has continued this work by leading efforts to ensure Congress passed legislation renewing and strengthening the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) three times: in 2000, 2005, and 2013. Each time, the VAWA reauthorization has upped the ante and ensured that especially vulnerable communities , from Native women to LGBTQ+ individuals , are included in the Act. Also while in the Senate, Biden introduced and helped pass the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act in 2008. As Vice President, he established the first White House Advisor on Violence Against Women and started a national effort to change the culture on campus sexual assault. After leaving the White House, Biden continued his work to change the culture of violence and end campus sexual assault through the Biden Foundation.As President, Biden will build on his strong track record of getting things done for survivors of gender-based violence by pursuing a bold plan to save more lives and make communities safer for all. He will:Read Biden\u2019s full plans to end violence against women at joebiden.com\/vawa and his plan to address violence against women during COVID-19 at joebiden.com\/plans-to-support-women-duringcovid19\/.PROTECT AND EMPOWER WOMEN GLOBALL,Governments, economies, industries, and communities everywhere are made stronger when they include the full participation of women. Yet, women are underrepresented in positions of power in most countries around the world. Trillions of dollars are lost each year from the global economy because women are excluded from full economic participation. One in three women worldwide will experience gender-based violence in her lifetime. Globally, 130 million girls between the ages of 6 and 17 are not in school; one in five girls are likely to marry before she turns 18. These statistics are bad for women, they\u2019re bad for countries and economies, and they are likely to worsen post-pandemic.That\u2019s why the Obama-Biden Administration put a direct focus on women\u2019s and girls\u2019 empowerment to enhance our national security. The Administration created the first U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security; the first U.S. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally; as well as the first U.S. Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls. As a Senator, Biden introduced the International Violence Against Women Act (IVAWA), which provided a framework for the United States to address gender-based violence globally. The Obama-Biden administration implemented many of IVAWA\u2019s provisions via executive action and adopted its comprehensive approach to gender-based violence.Yet, instead of building on the progress of the Obama-Biden Administration, Donald Trump has abandoned American leadership and adopted policies that directly harm women, including some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations. The effects of Trump\u2019s policies are compounded as women and girls disproportionately bear the negative impact of the pandemic, particularly those in already-marginalized communities or living in fragile states or as migrants, displaced persons, and refugees.Biden believes that we must support women through the current health and economic crises, draw on their expertise to ensure an effective recovery, and address the factors that leave them vulnerable in the first place. Biden will restore America\u2019s leading role as a champion for women and girls around the world and return to a government-wide focus of uplifting the rights of women and girls at home and abroad. He will:","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/the-biden-agenda-for-women-d4055e41822f?source=user_profile---------29----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Joe Biden is going to build our country back better after this economic crisis and that includes ensuring we get closer to full inclusion of and equality for women.

The Obama-Biden administration implemented many of IVAWA's provisions via executive action and adopted its comprehensive approach to gender-based violence.Yet, instead of building on the progress of the Obama-Biden Administration, Donald Trump has abandoned American leadership and adopted policies that directly harm women, including some of the world's most vulnerable populations. The effects of Trump's policies are compounded as women and girls disproportionately bear the negative impact of the pandemic, particularly those in already-marginalized communities or living in fragile states or as migrants, displaced persons, and refugees.Biden believes that we must support women through the current health and economic crises, draw on their expertise to ensure an effective recovery, and address the factors that leave them vulnerable in the first place. Biden will restore America's leading role as a champion for women and girls around the world and return to a government-wide focus of uplifting the rights of women and girls at home and abroad."}
{"SpeechID":"MEJB287202024","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-07-28","SpeechTitle":"My Remarks on Racial Economic Equity","RawText":"Thank you, Wayne Jefferson, and everyone at the Hicks center for hosting us.You and your staff do God\u2019s work. This community center gives people hope and a place to belong.I saw that hope as a Senator. And when he was Attorney General of Delaware, my son Beau would attend mass at Sacred Heart and then walk here to listen, notebook in his pocket, and find ways to help.It\u2019s on the East Side, where I was a lifeguard at the local pool as a teenager, where I started my career as a public defender. And this center is named after my friend, William \u201cHicks\u201d Anderson.Hicks and I went way back.Walk around Wilmington and everyone has a story about him.How he cared. How he was always there for you. How he built a wonderful family, including his twin sons Al and Nnamdi, who give back so much to this communit,They served in the United States Army. They now jointly serve as poet laureates of the State of Delaware.Nnamdi is now a State Representative. Hicks, his family, and everyone at this center, embody the defining story of America.For generations, Americans who are Black, Brown, Native American, immigrant, haven\u2019t always been fully included in our democracy or our economy.But by pure courage, heart and gut, they never give up as they pursue the full promise of America.That\u2019s the story of the people of this community and of this country.That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t think of a more meaningful place to talk about my Build Back Better economic agenda. A bold, practical plan that will help build a stronger, more just, more sustainable economy where everyone is included in the deal.And it\u2019s the story of two civil rights heroes we lost last week , and who show us the way forward.The Reverend C.T. Vivian, who faced down drownings and beatings to say \u201cYou cannot turn your back upon the idea of justice.\u201dAnd my friend, an American hero, Congressman John Lewis, who crossed the Edmund Pettus bridge one last time on Sunday, and who once said \u201cfreedom is not a state, it is an act.\u201dWhen I spoke to John just before he died, instead of answering my concerns for him, he asked about me, about us.He asked that we stay focused on the work left undone to heal this nation.To remain undaunted by the public health crisis and the economic crisis that has taken the blinders off the crisis of systemic racism that still plagues this nation.One thing the Senate and this President can do right away is pass the bill to restore the Voting Rights Act , just yesterday renamed in memory of John Lewis.Back the effusive praise we\u2019ve heard since he passed, especially from our Republican friends, with action. Protect the sacred right to vote that he was willing to die for.If they don\u2019t, it will be one of the first things I do as President. We cannot let that fundamental right to vote be denied, especially in the middle of a pandemic that rages on.Nearly 150,000 Americans are now dead from Covid-19, and counting. More than 4 million Americans have tested positive, and counting. Black and Latino people have been three times as likely to be infected , and two times as likely to die from the virus as white people. More than 30 Million people are collecting unemployment checks.Black unemployment is at 15%, Latino unemployment is at 14.5%.Over 40% of black-owned businesses , 440,000 in total , reportedly had to shut down.And everything is worsened by the crisis of presidential leadership.A change of \u201ctone\u201d over a few days does not change the facts of the last four years.Donald Trump fails the basic threshold test of being president , the duty to care about the entire country, not just himself.He has shown that he can\u2019t beat the pandemic to keep you safe. He can\u2019t turn the economy around to get Americans back to work.And he is , horrifyingly, but not surprisingly , intentionally stoking the flames of division in this country.I\u2019ve said from the outset of the recent protests that there is no place for violence or the destruction of property. Peaceful protesters should be protected , but arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted , and local law enforcement can do that. When President Obama and I were in office we protected federal property. And we were able to do it without turning DHS into a private militia. That could be done today. But that wouldn\u2019t help Trump\u2019s political interests. He is determined to stoke division and chaos. It\u2019s not good for the country , but Trump doesn\u2019t care. His campaign is failing and he\u2019s looking for a political lifeline. This isn\u2019t about law and order. This is a political strategy to revive a failing campaign. Every instinct Trump has is to add fuel to any fire. And it\u2019s the last thing we need. We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll restore peace to the streets.But this election is not just about voting against Donald Trump.It\u2019s about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people\u2019s struggle, and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome.Last month, I stopped by Bethel AME Church here in Wilmington. I talked with a group of faith and local leaders. They shared their pain, anger, and frustration at the state of affairs , in our justice system, our politics, our economy. There\u2019s just that sense the deck is stacked.The common theme was how do we break the cycle , in good times, communities of color still lag, in bad times, they get hit first and the hardest and in recovery, take the longest to bounce back.It is about justice.I\u2019ve proposed a criminal justice reform and policing reform agenda and I\u2019m committed to working with the Congress to seeing it through as President.It\u2019s also about jobs. Good-paying jobs, financial stability, and building wealth for families of color and passing it down to their kids.It\u2019s about economic growth for our country, and outcompeting the world.And it\u2019s also about dignity for working people and the middle class.Over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve laid out my Build Back Better plan based on those necessities and on the idea that we can\u2019t just build back to the way things were before.We have to Build Back Better.We need to make bold, practical investments , to recover from the economic mess we\u2019re in, and to rebuild for the economic future our country deserves. I\u2019ve explained how these investments are paid for.Today, I\u2019m here to explain how Build Back Better will deal with systemic racism and advance racial equity in our economy.So far, Build Back Better has had three parts.First, it\u2019s investing in American manufacturing and technology so the future is Made in America and includes all Americans.Under my plan, we will mobilize the biggest investment in rebuilding our country since World War 2, creating millions of good-paying union jobs.That includes a historic investment in federal procurement, which is the way the government purchases goods and services. Under my proposal, we would make sure those goods and services are American-made in American supply chains , like American steel for our buildings and energy efficient vehicles.But for too long, federal contracting for this work has been inaccessible for too many Black and Brown entrepreneurs and businesses.They too often never get a fair shot to apply.My plan makes sure contractors and subcontractors of color get a fair shot.We will triple the federal goal for contracting with small disadvantaged businesses from 5 percent to a minimum of 15 percent by 2025.And we will create jobs and growth along the way. We can do that.The second plank of Build Back Better advances racial equity by modernizing our infrastructure and taking on climate change with jobs.Take infrastructure, for example.In too many underserved communities of color , the roads are falling apart, street lights are out, sidewalks are cracked, school buildings are outdated. Parks aren\u2019t safe for kids to play and adults to exercise, and there\u2019s nowhere to buy fresh food for miles. Air pollution causes childhood asthma that follows them as adults, and abandoned homes crush property values and diminish the quality of life in neighborhoods. But notwithstanding these systemic barriers, look at the energy, pride, and achievement of communities of color. Imagine if we could truly unleash their full potential. My Build Back Better plan would make sure families in these communities are the ones who benefit from hundreds of billions in federal investments. To rebuild those roads, fill the sidewalk cracks, install broadband to close the digital divide, and create spaces to live, work, and play safely. Where they can drink clean water, breathe clean air, and shop at nearby grocery stores that stock fresh and healthy food. We can\u2019t rebuild our economy and meet the climate crisis unless we create opportunities for people to rebuild their own communities. This is about jobs. But it\u2019s also about dignity. It\u2019s about pride. We can do this.The third plank of Build Back Better invests in our caregivers , who take care of our aging loved ones and kids.If we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying. And we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators.Families are squeezed emotionally and financially trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability.They need help, but often can\u2019t find it or afford it.And the professional caregivers out there , home health workers, child care workers , who are more often women, women of color, and immigrants , are too often underpaid, unseen, and undervalued.But there are things we can do right now to ease the burden.My plan would help clear a waiting list of 800,000 people who are eligible for home and community care through Medicaid and who have signed up for it, but are just waiting.My plan would make sure every 3- and 4-year-old child gets access to free, high-quality preschool like students have at this center. And low- to middle-income families won\u2019t spend more than 7% of their income on child care for children under age 5.The most hard-pressed working families won\u2019t have to spend a dime.And my plan would pay and support our caregivers, who are overwhelmingly women and women of color.This plan will help workers, especially those without a college degree, gain new skills in good-paying industries like health care, and provide new pathways to advance their careers. For example, a home health worker can access the training needed to become an EMT, a nurse, a physician\u2019s assistant, or a doctor. We won\u2019t just put millions of Americans to work in new care and early childhood education jobs. We will also free up millions more people to join the paid labor force. Meaning at least 2 million additional jobs and more economic growth for our nation.We can do this.Today, I\u2019m laying out the fourth part of Build Back Better , advancing racial equity across the American economy, not just as part of the other pillars of Build Back Better, but in its own right.To start, we will create a new Small Business Opportunity Fund. It dramatically expands an successful Obama-Biden initiative that generated more than $5 in private investment for every $1 in public investment in small businesses , particularly in hard-pressed areas.We will take $30 Billion from our Made in America investments I announced earlier and put it into this Fund.That will allow us to expand federal support for the most effective state, local, and non-profit programs that provide venture capital and financing for minority business owners and communities in need.It will also allow us to support the community development banks that have a proven record of investing in minority small businesses.That $30 billion will leverage $150 Billion in new financing and equity for more Black and Brown small businesses.So say our Small Business Opportunity Fund supports an investment in a small manufacturer of color seeking to commercialize a new technology.That helps the manufacturer get started. Then private investors notice the promise of that business and invest their private dollars too.That helps the manufacturer scale and grow.That\u2019s how we will make sure that those with the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of their race or zip code.Here\u2019s why that matters.Right now, we\u2019re in the midst of one of the greatest threats to small businesses our country has ever seen.What does Donald Trump do?Give big banks the green light to make millions of dollars in fees by favoring their most well-off and well-connected clients while shutting the door on smaller Black and Brown businesses without those connections.The result?Billions of dollars in the Covid-relief program for small businesses benefited ones who had the lawyers and accountants to help better connected businesses jump the line.Black and Brown small businesses that needed help the most got shut out.In fact, just 12% of Black and Brown businesses surveyed seeking help got the aid they asked for.Now half of them say they\u2019ll have to close up shop. Our economy can\u2019t afford for them to close. Their families can\u2019t afford for them to close. Under my plan, fifty percent of emergency small business relief would be reserved for the smallest businesses with 50 employees or fewer. This would help minority-owned businesses get life-saving loans before more well-connected businesses jump ahead in line. But removing the barriers for Black and Brown entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses is only one of many things we must do to close the racial wealth gap in our nation. Expanding black and brown homeownership is another. Today, there are American cities where about 75% of white Americans own homes, while only about 25% of their fellow Black citizens do. Even in middle class communities of color, the same homes as in white communities are often valued significantly less. Those Black residents then see their wealth accumulate more slowly. When a house is an asset that helps build equity and wealth, the homeownership disparity denies equal opportunities. My housing plan from a $15,000 first-time home-buyer tax credit to expanding affordable housing to reversing Trump\u2019s efforts to gut fair housing enforcement, will remove the barriers to homeownership that now hold back too many Americans of color on the pathway to the middle class.But we also have to remove another piece of the systemic barrier for too many Black and Brown Americans.What\u2019s holding back too many people of color , in finding a good job or starting a business , is a criminal record that follows them every step of the way.Getting caught for smoking marijuana shouldn\u2019t deny you a good-paying job and career, a loan, or ability to rent an apartment.But right now, that criminal record is the weight that holds back too many people of color.The process to seal or expunge those records can be complicated and costly.And a life of second chances passes by.Now, some safeguards are necessary, but some do more harm than good.And more and more states recognize the significant cost to their economy when people with certain nonviolent criminal records can\u2019t fully contribute their full talents and capacity.But even when those states want to give that person a second chance and seal or expunge certain nonviolent criminal records, their record keeping systems are outdated.It is paper spread across different courthouses.Under my plan, if a state decides it wants to implement an automated system for sealing or expunging certain nonviolent criminal records, the federal government will help them do that.That\u2019s what racial equity in our economy looks like.And here\u2019s another step we will take under my Build Back Better plan to fully include more people into the deal , strengthen the Federal Reserve\u2019s focus on racial economic equity.The Fed has a profound impact on our economy.Its existing mandate promotes maximum employment and stable prices.Under my plan, I believe the Fed should add to that responsibility and aggressively target persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages, wealth, and revise its hiring and employment practices to achieve greater diversity at all levels of the institution , including diverse nominees for the Board of Governors and the regional Federal Reserve Banks. So when the Chairman of the Federal Reserve provides a report on the health of the economy , we\u2019ll know if the economy is working for everyone.That\u2019s when racial equity is not just an aspiration, but a theory of change and how we build our economic future to include everyone.To include all those remarkable people out there doing extraordinary things if given just half a chance.People like Markevis Gideon, who I just met backstage. His Mom and Dad never went to college. He was 12 when he got an old laptop handed to him. He took it apart and put it back together. It changed his life. At 17, he got certified to become an IT systems specialist. He went to college. Studied abroad. Came back home to see the digital divide in his community. So he started a business getting computers to folks. He\u2019s 22 now. Married with a little baby. He also has 7 employees. His goal is to teach people how to repair and recycle computers and create a workforce development program to get them trained for good-paying IT jobs. It\u2019s incredible. And he is incredible. Some of the people he\u2019s helped only had an 8th grade education. Never used a computer before. Five weeks later, they know how. Some are now earning $15\/hr for the first time. They are incredible. Markevis wants to scale his business and continue reinvesting in the people of this community. That\u2019s pure courage, heart, and gut.He never gives up in pursuit of the full promise of America.That\u2019s who we are. That\u2019s what this election is about. We are America.We don\u2019t settle. We aspire. We succeed.Thank you.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/my-remarks-on-racial-economic-equity-5767ac198451?source=user_profile---------26----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Thank you, Wayne Jefferson, and everyone at the Hicks center for hosting us.You and your staff do God's work.

So when the Chairman of the Federal Reserve provides a report on the health of the economy , we'll know if the economy is working for everyone.That's when racial equity is not just an aspiration, but a theory of change and how we build our economic future to include everyone.To include all those remarkable people out there doing extraordinary things if given just half a chance.People like Markevis Gideon, who I just met backstage. His Mom and Dad never went to college. He was 12 when he got an old laptop handed to him. He took it apart and put it back together. It changed his life. At 17, he got certified to become an IT systems specialist. He went to college. Studied abroad. Came back home to see the digital divide in his community. So he started a business getting computers to folks. He's 22 now. Married with a little baby. He also has 7 employees. His goal is to teach people how to repair and recycle computers and create a workforce development program to get them trained for good-paying IT jobs. It's incredible. And he is incredible. Some of the people he's helped only had an 8th grade education. Never used a computer before. Five weeks later, they know how. Some are now earning $15\/hr for the first time. They are incredible. Markevis wants to scale his business and continue reinvesting in the people of this community. That's pure courage, heart, and gut.He never gives up in pursuit of the full promise of America.That's who we are. That's what this election is about. We are America.We don't settle. We aspire. We succeed.Thank you."}
{"SpeechID":"MEJB287202025","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-07-28","SpeechTitle":"The Biden Plan to Build Back Better by Advancing Racial Equity Across the American Economy","RawText":"Joe Biden\u2019s jobs and economic recovery agenda is built on the proposition that we must build our economy back better than it was before the COVID-19 crisis. Over the last month, Biden has been laying out his vision for a stronger, resilient, and inclusive economy. He believes in an economy where every American enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. An economy more vibrant and more powerful precisely because everybody will be included in the deal. An economy where Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI), and Native American workers and families are finally welcomed as full participants. Today, multiple, overlapping crises reinforce how far we have to go to deliver on that vision. The pandemic has shone a bright light on racial disparities in health and health care , as Black and Brown Americans have suffered and died from the coronavirus at rates far higher than white Americans. The economic crisis has hit Black and Brown communities especially hard, with Black unemployment at 15.4 percent, Latino unemployment at 14.5 percent, and businesses owned by Black, Latino, and Asian American people closing down at alarming rates. We are also seeing a national reckoning on racial justice and the tragic human costs of systemic racism in the murder of George Floyd and so many other Black men, women, and children. And through it all, the climate crisis mounts, with air and water pollution, superstorms and extreme weather, disproportionately impacting Black and Brown communities. Biden believes we cannot build back better without a major mobilization of effort and resources to address these challenges and to advance racial equity across the American economy. That is why racial equity is a distinct pillar of his Build Back Better plan, as well as incorporated in each of the other pillars. Biden will remove barriers to participation in our economy, expand access to opportunity, and fully enforce the policies and laws that we already have on the books , and the pledges Biden has made in this campaign. In laying out his Build Back Better agenda, Biden has announced bold investments , in infrastructure, innovation, manufacturing, education, housing, clean energy, federal procurement, and small businesses. Today, as the fourth pillar of the Build Back Better Agenda, he is announcing how he will direct many of these investments to advance racial equity as part of our nation\u2019s economic recovery. Specifically, Biden will:SPUR PUBLIC-PRIVATE INVESTMENT THROUGH A NEW SMALL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY PLAN Small business ownership is one of our country\u2019s cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. However, persistent racial disparities in wealth and access to capital, combined with outright discrimination in the financial sector, have contributed to inequities in small business ownership, growth, and success. To address the racial wealth gap, the opportunity gap, and the jobs gap for Black and Brown people, Biden will launch a historic effort to empower small business creation and expansion in economically disadvantaged areas , and particularly for Black-, Latino-, AAPI-, and Native American-owned businesses. In addition to providing small businesses with an ambitious \u201crestart package\u201d to survive the current crisis and come out the other side strong, he is launching a special, ongoing initiative to empower these entrepreneurs to succeed and grow with a three-prong Small Business Opportunity Plan. His plan is consistent with key elements in the Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act recently proposed by Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer, Mark Warner, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. Biden will:Collectively, Biden will leverage more than $150 billion in new capital and opportunities for small businesses that have been structurally excluded for generations. Biden will devote $30 billion (or 10%) of the $300 billion in innovation funding as part of his plan to ensure the future is \u201cMade in All of America\u201d to the Small Business Opportunity Fund to leverage private investment of $5 for each $1 of new public investment to reach this $150 billion. And, by empowering the financial institutions that support businesses owned by Black and Brown people, generating new capital, and providing robust technical assistance, Biden will unleash the full potential of small businesses and entrepreneurs. Spur More than $50 Billion in New Equity Investment and Venture Capital for Entrepreneurs in Economically Disadvantaged Areas: Black and Brown entrepreneurs face unique barriers to obtaining the capital that they need to start and grow a business. For example, three-fourths of venture capital goes to just four cities , and far too little flows to businesses owned by Black and Brown people. To address this problem, Biden will:Leverage $100 Billion in Additional Financing for Small Businesses: In 2019, only 10% of funding from the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) major lending programs went to Black, Latino, and Native American entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, the Paycheck Protection Program has been rife with inequities: A recent \u201csecret shopper\u201d study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition found that when Black small businesses applicants contacted a bank, nearly half the time, they were given inferior treatment to white applicants with nearly identical credit histories and business profiles. To address this problem, Biden will:Expanding Access to Additional Resources and Technical Assistance for Black and Brown Entrepreneurs: There are no limits or barriers to the talent and entrepreneurial spirit across our nation. Yet, for many, there are major limits to accessing the networks and professional services needed to succeed. For small businesses in underserved communities, this type of assistance is often unavailable or unaffordable, creating an additional barrier to opportunity. As President, Biden will launch an Expanding Entrepreneurship Initiative that provides all Americans, regardless of their background, with the resources and technical assistance they need to start and grow their own business. This initiative will:REFORM OPPORTUNITY ZONES TO ENSURE THEY SERVE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES, SMALL BUSINESSES, AND HOMEOWNERS Like many Americans, Biden initially hoped that Opportunity Zones would be structured and administered by the Trump Administration in a way that advanced racial equity, small business creation, and homeownership in low-income urban, rural, and tribal communities. It is now clear that the Trump Administration has failed to deliver on that promise in too many places around America. As the Urban Institute has found, the program as a whole is \u201cnot living up to its economic and community development goals.\u201d While there have been positive examples, in too many instances investors favor high-return projects like luxury apartments over affordable housing and local entrepreneurs. We cannot close the racial wealth gap if we allow billionaires to exploit Opportunity Zones tax breaks to pad their wealth, rather than investing in projects that benefit distressed low-income communities and Americans that are struggling to make ends meet. As President, Joe Biden will task his team to develop a plan for reforming Opportunity Zones, including steps like:MAKE A HISTORIC COMMITMENT TO EQUALIZING FEDERAL PROCUREMENT AS PART OF HIS BOLD PROCUREMENT PLAN Biden\u2019s Build Back Better plan includes a historic procurement effort designed to support small businesses and tackle long standing inequities in the federal contracting system. During his first term, Biden will tighten Buy American requirements for existing procurement and invest $400 billion in additional federal purchases of products made by American workers. And, he will make transparent, targeted investments that unleash new demand for domestic goods and services and create American jobs in communities across the country. As part of this effort, his multi-pronged small business contracting strategy will include formula-based awards; widespread outreach and counseling to small business owners, especially Black and Brown business owners; and transparent, frequent monitoring of contract awards. This will make certain that the largest mobilization of public investments in procurement, infrastructure, and R&D since WWII is equitably distributed across communities and businesses. Biden will also take concrete steps to streamline the federal procurement process as a whole and ensure it finally mirrors the demographics of this country. Specifically, Biden will:Throughout, Biden will ensure federal dollars support American workers and their families. As called for in his plan to strengthen worker organizing, collective bargaining, and unions, Biden will require that all companies receiving procurement contracts are using taxpayer dollars to support good American jobs, including a commitment to pay at least $15 per hour, provide paid leave, maintain fair overtime and scheduling practices, and guarantee a choice to join a union and bargain collectively.ENSURE HIS HOUSING PLAN MAKES BOLD INVESTMENTS IN HOMEOWNERSHIP AND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR BLACK, LATINO, NATIVE, AND AAPI FAMILIES Biden believes the middle class isn\u2019t a number, but a value set that includes the ability to own your own home and live in a safe community. Housing should be a right, not a privilege. Today, however, far too many Americans lack access to affordable and quality housing. Racial inequality permeates U.S. housing markets, with homeownership rates for Black, Latino, AAPI, and Native American households far below those of their white counterparts. Because home ownership is how many families save and build wealth, these racial disparities in home ownership contribute to the racial wealth gap. It is far past time to put an end to systemic housing discrimination and other contributors to this disparity. At the same time, many families around the country face immediate risk of eviction in the midst of the Trump-created economic crisis. In June, more than one-third of renters , including 49% of Hispanic families and 43% of Black families , were not sure that they could pay their next month\u2019s rent. To prevent a catastrophic rise in evictions and homelessness, Congress and President Trump must act now by creating a broad emergency housing support program modeled on the steps the government takes to address natural disasters, in order to get help out quickly and at scale. To help families build wealth, secure a safe place to live in a vibrant and prosperous community, and ensure equal access to all aspects of the housing market, Biden will:See Joe Biden\u2019s full housing plan at https:\/\/joebiden.com\/housing\/ ACHIEVE EQUITY IN MANAGEMENT, TRAINING, AND HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES CONNECTED TO JOBS OF THE FUTURE Stark racial disparities exist at every stage of our education system. These disparities compound and contribute to inequity in economic, health, housing, and criminal justice outcomes. As President, Biden will make significant investments into educational institutions and programs that are designed to elevate Black and Brown students. He will:BOOST RETIREMENT SECURITY AND FINANCIAL WEALT,Black and Brown families , and especially Black and Brown women , face disadvantages at every turn, from access to workplace retirement accounts to access to generational wealth. These disadvantages have resulted in large and persistent gaps in financial wealth. To help Black and Brown people have more opportunities to build up a nest egg, Biden will:ENSURE WORKERS OF COLOR ARE COMPENSATED FAIRLY AND TREATED WITH DIGNITY Workers of color still earn a fraction of white workers and are less likely to have essential benefits like health coverage and paid leave. In fact, the black-white wage gap persists across every level of education and is widening. And wage gaps are exacerbated for women of color with Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women earning 68 cents, Black women earning 62 cents, Native women earning 57 cents, and Latinas earning 54 cents for every dollar a white man earns, adds up, on average, to roughly $1 million over a lifetime career, especially detrimental for the nearly 70% of Black mothers who are the sole or primary breadwinners for their family. Biden\u2019s plan to build back better requires rooting out discrimination in the workplace so people can earn what they deserve, support their families, and build wealth.INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES Crumbling infrastructure is a barrier to growth and prosperity. If roads are falling apart; if lights and landscaping of public areas are not tended to; if sidewalks are dilapidated or schools are outdated; if there are no parks for kids to play in after school; if there is no fresh food for miles; if there are abandoned houses that need to be demolished or empty strip malls and not enough infrastructure to prevent fires; if there is nowhere to go when you are in a mental health crisis , how can a community thrive? We are the world\u2019s richest nation, but for far too long Black, Latino, AAPI, and Native American communities have been left behind. By making real and sustained investments into Black and Brown communities, we will create an environment where businesses and investments will multiply in size and strength. In Black and Brown communities the federal government will provide state, tribal, and local governments with resources to:Biden\u2019s Build Back Better plan includes a national effort to create the jobs we need to build a modern, sustainable, accessible, infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future. He will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment, with a plan to deploy those resources over his first term, toward that end. A major focus of this investment will be to upgrade the infrastructure and job opportunities in Black and Brown communities. Specifically, Biden will:See more details about the Biden infrastructure plans at https:\/\/joebiden.com\/infrastructure\/ and joebiden.com\/clean-energy SECOND CHANCES FOR ECONOMIC SUCCESS Biden believes in redemption. For people who are convicted of a crime, after they serve their sentence, they should have the opportunity to fully reintegrate into society, earn a good living, and participate in our democracy. It will not only benefit them, it will benefit all of society. It is also our best strategy to reduce recidivism. The collateral consequences for a criminal record are vast. The National Institute of Justice found that there are more than 44,000 collateral consequences nationwide, including employment restrictions, loss of voting rights, denial of housing or even renting an apartment and educational loan restrictions to name a few. Smart Data Infrastructure to Support Second Chances Most states already have a process for people who want to shield their criminal record from public view , expungement and sealing. But getting a person\u2019s record expunged or sealed is complicated and requires paperwork, time, and sometimes the support of legal counsel. As President, Biden will advance a pathway for redemption and re-entry , and make real the possibility of second chances for all Americans , by helping states modernize their criminal justice data infrastructure and adopt automated record sealing for selected categories of non-violent offenses, to modernize their criminal justice data infrastructure. This data infrastructure will facilitate sealing of records in a manner that is precise, complete and efficient , so those records are not used to deny people jobs, housing, voting rights, school loans and other opportunities to rebuild their lives. The grants Biden is proposing will support state efforts to research, plan for, and ultimately implement the criminal record data infrastructure improvements that will make automated record relief possible. Beyond that, the infrastructure improvements will yield a general improvement in the operation and efficiency of state records. In addition, to invest in second chances and smart criminal justice reforms that will improve public safety, Biden will:STRENGTHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE\u2019S FOCUS ON RACIAL ECONOMIC GAPS The Federal Reserve (the Fed) plays a highly influential role in determining the overall unemployment rate, as well as that of Black and Brown people. Within its existing mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, the Fed should aggressively enhance its surveillance and targeting of persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages, and wealth. Biden will work with Congress to amend the Federal Reserve Act to require the Fed to regularly report on current data and trends in racial economic gaps , and what actions the Fed is taking through its monetary and regulatory policies to close these gaps. Access to affordable financial services is another first-order barrier to wealth building for many American families. Biden supports the Fed committing to a \u201creal-time\u201d payment system, a change the central bank has the authority to implement. With this system in place, instead of waiting days for checks to clear, low-income people will have instant access to money they are owed, ending an existing, costly burden to cash-constrained families. The Fed should also revise its hiring and employment practices to achieve greater diversity at all levels of the institution , including at the leadership of the Board of Governors and the regional Federal Reserve Banks. PRIORITIZE RACIAL EQUITY ACROSS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMEN,INVEST IN A 21ST CENTURY CARE INFRASTRUCTURE Biden believes that if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying, and we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, training and education opportunities for certification, and dignity of caregiving workers and educators. He will make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country , to make child care more affordable and accessible for working families, and to make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to have quality, affordable home- or community-based care. And, he is proposing to give caregiving workers and early childhood educators a raise and stronger benefits, treating them as the professionals they are. Caregivers and early childhood educators , disproportionately Black and Brown women , have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long. Biden will:ADDRESS LONGSTANDING INEQUITIES IN AGRICULTURE Black, Brown and Native farmers have long faced barriers to growing their agricultural businesses, including unfair prices, unequal access to government support, retaliation for civil rights complaints, and outright injustice. For more than 100 years the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) did little to alleviate the burdens of systemic inequality for Black, Brown and Native farmers and was often the site of injustice. Over two decades ago, class action litigation was filed alleging longstanding discrimination against Black, Latino, Native, and women farmers. The cases dragged on for many years without relief for the complaints and impacted farmers struggled to regain the footing they lost before and during the litigation. A profound shift occurred for Black, Brown and Native farmers under the Obama-Biden administration during which the USDA oversaw the conclusion of what became the largest civil rights settlement in US history, bringing a painful chapter to a close. The settlements in these cases marked the beginning of a renewed commitment to supporting diversity, equity, and an internal reckoning for the USDA. Under Obama-Biden, the USDA sought to address both the structural and cultural causes of systemic inequality that had in prior generations been reproduced by the policies and practices of the agency. Despite the groundbreaking steps to address inequality that were taken under Obama-Biden, the practices and values of the USDA slid backwards under the authority of the Trump administration , which ceased many agency-wide efforts to level the playing field. As President, Biden will build upon the historic progress made during the Obama-Biden administration, taking additional steps to support the rights of Black, Brown and Native farmers by:","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/the-biden-plan-to-build-back-better-by-advancing-racial-equity-across-the-american-economy-66ceb43d2a72?source=user_profile---------27----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Joe Biden's jobs and economic recovery agenda is built on the proposition that we must build our economy back better than it was before the COVID-19 crisis.

In addition, to invest in second chances and smart criminal justice reforms that will improve public safety, Biden will:STRENGTHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S FOCUS ON RACIAL ECONOMIC GAPS The Federal Reserve (the Fed) plays a highly influential role in determining the overall unemployment rate, as well as that of Black and Brown people. Within its existing mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, the Fed should aggressively enhance its surveillance and targeting of persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages, and wealth. Biden will work with Congress to amend the Federal Reserve Act to require the Fed to regularly report on current data and trends in racial economic gaps , and what actions the Fed is taking through its monetary and regulatory policies to close these gaps. Access to affordable financial services is another first-order barrier to wealth building for many American families. Biden supports the Fed committing to a 'real-time' payment system, a change the central bank has the authority to implement. With this system in place, instead of waiting days for checks to clear, low-income people will have instant access to money they are owed, ending an existing, costly burden to cash-constrained families. The Fed should also revise its hiring and employment practices to achieve greater diversity at all levels of the institution , including at the leadership of the Board of Governors and the regional Federal Reserve Banks. PRIORITIZE RACIAL EQUITY ACROSS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMEN,INVEST IN A 21ST CENTURY CARE INFRASTRUCTURE Biden believes that if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying, and we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, training and education opportunities for certification, and dignity of caregiving workers and educators. He will make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country , to make child care more affordable and accessible for working families, and to make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to have quality, affordable home- or community-based care. And, he is proposing to give caregiving workers and early childhood educators a raise and stronger benefits, treating them as the professionals they are. Caregivers and early childhood educators , disproportionately Black and Brown women , have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long. Biden will:ADDRESS LONGSTANDING INEQUITIES IN AGRICULTURE Black, Brown and Native farmers have long faced barriers to growing their agricultural businesses, including unfair prices, unequal access to government support, retaliation for civil rights complaints, and outright injustice. For more than 100 years the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) did little to alleviate the burdens of systemic inequality for Black, Brown and Native farmers and was often the site of injustice. Over two decades ago, class action litigation was filed alleging longstanding discrimination against Black, Latino, Native, and women farmers. The cases dragged on for many years without relief for the complaints and impacted farmers struggled to regain the footing they lost before and during the litigation. A profound shift occurred for Black, Brown and Native farmers under the Obama-Biden administration during which the USDA oversaw the conclusion of what became the largest civil rights settlement in US history, bringing a painful chapter to a close. The settlements in these cases marked the beginning of a renewed commitment to supporting diversity, equity, and an internal reckoning for the USDA. Under Obama-Biden, the USDA sought to address both the structural and cultural causes of systemic inequality that had in prior generations been reproduced by the policies and practices of the agency. Despite the groundbreaking steps to address inequality that were taken under Obama-Biden, the practices and values of the USDA slid backwards under the authority of the Trump administration , which ceased many agency-wide efforts to level the playing field."}

{"SpeechID":"MEJB48202016","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-08-04","SpeechTitle":"The Biden Agenda for the Latino Community","RawText":"Joe Biden believes that the story of America is one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. The Latino community is a core part of the American community and their contributions are evident in every part of society. Our nation\u2019s ability to draw and welcome hard-working, aspirational people from every culture, from every nation is an indisputable strength. Our diversity is the source of America\u2019s constant renewal , the reason we\u2019ve been able to remake ourselves over and over. President Trump\u2019s assault on Latino dignity started on the very first day of his campaign. His assault doesn\u2019t just reveal itself in the betrayal of the Dreamers or in the pardoning of a sheriff who has terrorized the Latino community. It\u2019s in the underfunding of schools, in attacks on labor and the ability of workers to bargain for their worth, and in the neglect of Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria. Trump\u2019s strategy is to sow division , to cast out Latinos as being less than fully American. As President, Biden will ensure everyone is treated with dignity , no matter their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or zip code. And, he will ensure that everyone has a chance to join the middle class, including Latinos and other individuals never given a fair shot in decades past. Today, a full quarter of all children in the U.S. are Latino. Our collective success depends upon the success of the Latino community. Biden will be ready beginning on Day 1 to implement changes needed for the Latino community to thrive. Biden will:Additionally, in recognition of the unique contributions of Latinos to American history over the past 500 years, Biden will work to establish a Smithsonian National American Latino Museum. Latino history is intricately woven into the history of America and must be preserved and celebrated. These vast contributions are long overdue to be recognized in the family of Smithsonian Museums. As an initial step, Biden will initiate a feasibility study and a site location for the museum. In July 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives passed by voice vote , on a bipartisan basis , an act to establish this museum. Biden will also ensure that political appointees, including the President\u2019s Cabinet, look like the country they serve, and ensure that our federal workforce is representative of the demographics in our country. The Obama-Biden Administration made great progress in building a diverse federal workforce, but Biden knows work remains for the country to fully realize the benefits of the talents, abilities, and perspectives of a workforce that looks like the country. As President, Biden will nominate and appoint people who look like the country they serve and share Biden\u2019s commitment to rigorous enforcement of civil rights protections. This includes promoting diverse leadership for all federal agencies including the financial regulatory agencies that have a direct impact on the nature of our entire economic system; working with all branches of government, including the Senate and Supreme Court, to create best practices and standards for ensuring racial diversity among clerks, staffers, and interns; and creating a new post within the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers to focus on racial equity including the income and wealth gaps. He also will reissue and mandate strict compliance with the Obama-Biden executive order to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal government. He will rebuild the pipeline of workers into the federal government and incentivize more qualified workers to choose public service by forgiving $10,000 a year in student debt for up to five years of public service. He\u2019ll tap into the best and brightest talent from every source by developing career pipelines from Hispanic-serving Institutions and other Minority-serving Institutions into federal agencies. Biden will also provide more training and mentoring opportunities to improve retention, and collect better data about who is applying for federal service positions as well as being promoted. INVESTING IN LATINOS\u2019 ECONOMIC MOBILITY Latinos fill essential roles throughout our economy. But many Latinos are stuck in low-wage jobs and have lower rates of homeownership and less wealth in comparison to non-Hispanic whites. Biden is running for president to rebuild the middle class so that this time, everyone comes along, including Latinos. Supporting Public-Private Investment Through a New Small Business Opportunity Plan Small business ownership is one of our country\u2019s cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. However, persistent racial disparities in wealth and access to capital, combined with outright discrimination in the financial sector, have contributed to inequities in small business ownership, growth, and success. For example, Latinos are roughly 18% of the U.S. population but own less than 6% of small businesses with employees. Latino-owned firms also report lack of collateral as a top reason for credit denial. To address the racial wealth gap, the opportunity gap, and the jobs gap for Latinos, Biden will launch a historic effort to empower small business creation and expansion in economically disadvantaged areas , particularly for Latino-owned businesses and businesses owned by other people of color. In addition to providing small businesses with an ambitious \u201crestart package\u201d to survive the current crisis and come out the other side strong, he is proposing a special, ongoing initiative to empower these entrepreneurs to succeed and grow with a three-prong Small Business Opportunity Plan. His plan is consistent with key elements in the Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act recently proposed by Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer, Mark Warner, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. Biden will:Reforming Opportunity Zones to Ensure They Serve Latino Communities, Small Businesses, and Homeowners Like many Americans, Biden initially hoped that Opportunity Zones would be structured and administered by the Trump Administration in a way that advanced racial equity, small business creation, and homeownership in low-income urban, rural, and tribal communities. It is now clear that the Trump Administration has failed to deliver on that promise in too many places around America. As the Urban Institute has found, the program as a whole is \u201cnot living up to its economic and community development goals.\u201d While there have been positive examples, in too many instances investors favor high-return projects like luxury apartments over affordable housing and local entrepreneurs. We cannot close the racial wealth gap if we allow billionaires to exploit Opportunity Zones tax breaks to pad their wealth, rather than investing in projects that benefit distressed low-income communities and Americans that are struggling to make ends meet. As President, Biden will task his team to develop a plan for reforming Opportunity Zones, including steps like incentivizing Opportunity Funds to partner with nonprofit or community-oriented organizations and jointly produce a community-benefit plan for each investment. The focus should be on creating jobs for low-income residents and otherwise providing a direct financial impact to households within the Opportunity Zones. Make A Historic Commitment To Equalizing Federal Procurement Biden\u2019s Build Back Better plan includes a historic procurement effort designed to support small businesses and tackle long standing inequities in the federal contracting system. During his first term, Biden will tighten Buy American requirements for existing procurement and invest $400 billion in additional federal purchases of products made by American workers. And, he will make transparent, targeted investments that unleash new demand for domestic goods and services and create American jobs in communities across the country. As part of this effort, his multi-pronged small business contracting strategy will include formula-based awards; widespread outreach and counseling to small business owners, especially Latino business owners and other business owners of color; and transparent, frequent monitoring of contract awards. This will make certain that the largest mobilization of public investments in procurement, infrastructure, and R&D since WWII is equitably distributed across communities and businesses. Biden will also take concrete steps to streamline the federal procurement process as a whole and ensure it finally mirrors the demographics of this country. Specifically, Biden will require prime contractors to develop and fully execute plans to increase subcontracting opportunities for small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs). He will also triple the federal goal for contracting with SDBs from 5% to a minimum of 15% of all procurement dollars by 2025. To achieve this goal, which will send tens of billions of additional dollars to Latino communities and other communities of color, Biden will expand long-term technical assistance and federal contracting preferences for SDBs. And, he will incentivize state and local governments and private sector partners to contract with small disadvantaged businesses. Throughout, Biden will ensure federal dollars support Latino workers and their families. As called for in his plan to strengthen worker organizing, collective bargaining, and unions, Biden will require that all companies receiving procurement contracts are using taxpayer dollars to support good American jobs, including a commitment to pay at least $15 per hour, provide paid leave, maintain fair overtime and scheduling practices, and guarantee a choice to join a union and bargain collectively. Ensure Latino Workers are Compensated Fairly and Treated With Dignity This pandemic has shown the world who essential workers really are , and many of them are Latino workers who feed the country, keep our communities clean, and care for our loved ones. But for too long they have not been treated with dignity or provided with the opportunity they deserve. Latino workers still earn a fraction of what white workers earn and are less likely to have essential benefits like health coverage and paid leave. And Latinas earn only 54 cents for every dollar a white man earns, adding up, on average, to over $1.1 million over a lifetime career. This is especially detrimental for the more than four in ten Latina mothers who are the sole or primary breadwinners for their family. Biden\u2019s plan to build back better requires rooting out discrimination in the workplace so people can earn what they deserve, support their families, and build wealth. Biden will continue to prioritize closing wage gaps and ending paycheck discrimination. He will increase the federal minimum wage to $15 across the country and eliminate the minimum tipped wage, disproportionately benefitting Latino workers. He will also support small businesses like restaurants during this economic crisis, helping them get back on their feet so they can keep their doors open and pay their workers. The Obama-Biden Administration fought to extend overtime pay to over 4 million workers and protect nearly 9 million from losing it, but the Trump Administration reversed this progress, implementing a new rule that leaves millions of workers behind , including nearly 1.3 million Latino workers. Biden will ensure workers are paid fairly for the long hours they work and get the overtime pay they deserve. And he will ensure that domestic workers and farm workers receive overtime protections. Biden will address discrimination and harassment in the workplace, guarantee up to 12 weeks paid family and medical leave for all workers and up to seven days of paid sick, family, and safe leave. Approximately one in three Latino workers have experienced employment discrimination and nearly one in two Latino workers do not have access to any paid leave. And Biden will make it easier for all workers to organize unions and bargain collectively. Unions are an essential path to the middle class, especially for Latinos. They allow workers to bargain for higher wages and benefits, and with more job protections, many union workers have greater job stability. In fact, Latinos who join a union receive an even larger pay increase than white workers who join a union, helping to close the wage gap, and one study found Latino union members have 11 times the wealth of Latino non-union members. Biden will include in the economic recovery legislation he sends to Congress a series of policies to build worker power to raise wages and secure stronger benefits. This legislation will make it easier for workers to organize a union and bargain collectively with their employers by including the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, card check, union and bargaining rights for public service workers, and a broad definition of \u201cemployee\u201d and tough enforcement to end the misclassification of workers as independent contractors. It will also go further than the PRO Act by holding company executives personally liable when they interfere with organizing efforts.

Invest In A 21st Century Care Infrastructure Even before the pandemic, more than three in five Latino families lived in child care deserts, with limited to no access to licensed child care. When Latino families do find child care, they are paying over $200 a week , often more than they can afford. At the same time, caregivers and early childhood educators , disproportionately Latino women and other women of color , have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long. Biden believes that if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying, and we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, training and education opportunities for certification, and dignity of caregiving workers and educators. He will make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country to make child care more affordable and accessible for working families, and to make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to have quality, affordable home- or community-based care. And, he is proposing to give caregiving workers and early childhood educators a raise and stronger benefits, treating them as the professionals they are. This plan, combined with Biden\u2019s proposal to provide families with up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, will put 3 million Americans to work in new care and education jobs, and increase overall employment by about 5 million after taking into account the economic impacts of increased labor force participation after unpaid caregivers , disproportionately women , are able to pursue paid careers if they so choose.

Make Bold Investments in Homeownership and Access to Affordable Housing for Latino Families Biden believes the middle class isn\u2019t a number, but a value set that includes the ability to own your own home and live in a safe community. Housing should be a right, not a privilege.Today, however, far too many Americans lack access to affordable and quality housing. Racial inequality permeates U.S. housing markets, with the homeownership rate for Latino households far below those of their white counterparts. In fact, just 51% of Latinos own their own home, compared to 76% of non-Hispanic white Americans. Because home ownership is how many families save and build wealth, these racial disparities contribute to the racial wealth gap. At the same time, many families around the country face immediate risk of eviction in the midst of the Trump-created economic crisis. To help families build wealth, secure a safe place to live in a vibrant and prosperous community, and ensure equal access to all aspects of the housing market, Biden will help families buy their first homes and build wealth by creating a new refundable, advanceable tax credit of up to $15,000. Biden\u2019s First Down Payment Tax Credit will help low- and middle-income families offset the costs of home buying and help millions of families lay down roots for the first time. Biden will also:Invest In Infrastructure In Latino Communities Biden\u2019s Build Back Better plan includes a national effort to create the jobs we need to build a modern, sustainable, accessible, infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future.

Address Longstanding Inequities in Agriculture Latino farmers and other farmers of color have long faced barriers to growing their agricultural businesses, including unfair prices, unequal access to government support, retaliation for civil rights complaints, and outright injustice. For more than 100 years, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) did little to alleviate the burdens of systemic inequality for Latino, Black, and Native farmers and was often the site of injustice. Over two decades ago, class action litigation was filed alleging longstanding discrimination against Latino, Black, Native, and women farmers. The cases dragged on for many years without relief for the complainants and impacted farmers struggled to regain the footing they lost before and during the litigation. A profound shift occurred for Latino, Black, and Native farmers under the Obama-Biden Administration during which the USDA oversaw the conclusion of what became the largest civil rights settlement in US history, bringing a painful chapter to a close. The settlements in these cases marked the beginning of a renewed commitment to supporting diversity, equity, and an internal reckoning for the USDA. Under Obama-Biden, the USDA sought to address both the structural and cultural causes of systemic inequality that had in prior generations been reproduced by the policies and practices of the agency. Despite the groundbreaking steps to address inequality that were taken under Obama-Biden, the practices and values of the USDA slid backwards under the authority of the Trump Administration , which ceased many agency-wide efforts to level the playing field. As President, Biden will build upon the historic progress made during the Obama-Biden Administration, taking additional steps to support the rights of Latino, Black, and Native farmers by establishing an equity commission that will focus on the unique jurisdictional and regulatory barriers that Latino, Black, and Native farmers, ranchers, and fishers must negotiate and make sure that processes are streamlined and simplified to promote new and beginning farming and ranching operations by Latino, Black, and Native farmers. Biden will advance a comprehensive effort to assist in both the purchase of farmland and the ability of Latino, Black, and Native farmers to keep that land. This includes credit and technical support in the form of expedited credit, low-interest loans, and technical assistance. In addition, Biden recognizes the disadvantage that Latino, Black, and Native farmers face when they are forced to compete with other farmers who have decades of privileged access to federal assistance. As President, he will explore the use of land trusts, cooperative farm operations, and farm credit systems geared towards Latino, Black, and, Native farmers as a means to support this population and diversify our agricultural sector. Farmworkers , who are disproportionately Latino and immigrant workers , have always been essential to working our farms and feeding our country. As President, Biden will ensure farmworkers are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve, regardless of immigration status. He will work with Congress to provide legal status based on prior agricultural work history, ensure they can earn paid sick time, and require that labor and safety rules, including overtime, humane living conditions, and protection from pesticide and heat exposure, are strictly enforced.

MAKE FAR REACHING INVESTMENTS TO END HEALTH DISPARITIES BY RACE The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the long-standing, pervasive disparities that exist across our health care system due to unequal access to treatment. While we are still learning about the impact of COVID-19 , a clear pattern has emerged that suggests Latino communities are bearing disproportionate harm from the pandemic. Latinos are at an increased risk both of getting COVID-19 and of experiencing severe illness. Latinos are more than four times more likely to experience hospitalization due to COVID-19 than non-Hispanic white persons. President Trump should work with Congress to immediately enact Senator Kamala Harris\u2019 bill to create a task force to address the racial disparities that have been laid bare by this pandemic. As President, Biden will do everything in his power to eliminate health care disparities. Ensuring access to health care during this crisis In the short term, Biden\u2019s COVID-19 response plan calls on the Trump Administration to drop its support of a lawsuit to overturn Obamacare. Millions of Americans have already lost their health insurance because they lost their job, and millions more may find health care increasingly difficult to afford. During this crisis, Biden would expand access to quality, affordable health care for all through:Ensuring access to affordable, high-quality health care beyond the crisis Because of Obamacare, over 100 million people no longer have to worry that an insurance company will deny coverage or charge higher premiums just because they have a pre-existing condition , whether cancer or diabetes or heart disease or a mental health challenge. Insurance companies can no longer set annual or lifetime limits on coverage. Millions of Latinos obtained the peace of mind that comes with health insurance. Young people who are in transition from school to a job have the option to stay covered by their parents\u2019 plan until age 26. As a result, the uninsured rate among Latinos plummeted from 32% to 19% in the wake of Obamacare , the most substantial decrease of any racial or ethnic group. Now, in the middle of a pandemic, Trump is trying to strip away all health care protections for the millions of Latinos who depend on the Affordable Care Act. If President Trump is successful in his efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act, some estimates show that one in ten Latinos under age 65 will lose their health insurance. As President, Biden will build on Obamacare to expand Latinos\u2019 access to quality, affordable care. He will:Investing in Hispanic-serving Institutions to Help Solve Health Disparities As part of Biden\u2019s more than $70 billion investment in Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs), other Minority-serving Institutions (MSIs), and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), he will invest $10 billion to create at least 200 new centers of excellence that serve as research incubators and connect students underrepresented in fields critical to our nation\u2019s future to learning and career opportunities. He will develop robust internship and career pipelines at major research agencies, including National Institutes of Health. He will also dedicate additional and increased priority funding streams at federal agencies for grants and contracts for HSIs, other MSIs, and HBCUs. He will require any federal research grants to universities with an endowment of over $1 billion to form a meaningful partnership and enter into a 10% minimum subcontract with an HSI, other MSI, or HBCU. And, Biden will invest $5 billion in graduate programs in health care, along with teaching and STEM, at these schools. Read Biden\u2019s full health care plan at joebiden.com\/healthcare. EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING, AND TACKLE RACIAL INEQUITY IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM Over a quarter of K-12 public school students are Latino. Biden will make sure that every child in America has the chance to realize their full potential starting at birth, regardless of their zip code, race, or family income. Biden will work with states to ensure every low- and middle-income family has access to high-quality child care and to make high-quality pre-K available to every child. He\u2019ll close the gap between white and non-white school districts by nearly tripling Title I funding, the federal program funding schools with a high percentage of students from low-income families. This new funding will first be used to ensure teachers at Title I schools are paid competitively, three- and four-year olds have access to pre-school, and districts provide access to rigorous coursework , including computer science and other STEM subjects , across all their schools, not just a few. He\u2019ll expand \u201ccommunity schools\u201d that serve the needs of students and parents; and double the number of school psychologists, nurses, school counselors, and social workers, giving kids the support they need to grow. Biden will work to ensure that more public schools have additional resources to support English learners and ensure their parents receive information in the language they understand so they can participate in their child\u2019s education. And, through partnerships between high schools, community colleges, and employers, Biden will make sure that all kids have a chance to graduate with an industry credential, ready to compete in the 21st century workforce. Biden will also expand access for Latinos to quality, affordable education and training beyond high school. For too many, earning a degree or other credential after high school is unaffordable today. For others, their education saddles them with so much debt it prevents them from buying a home or saving for retirement, or their parents or grandparents take on some of the financial burden. But roughly six in ten jobs require some education beyond high school. Biden will:Read Biden\u2019s full education plans at joebiden.com\/education and joebiden.com\/beyondHS. COMBAT HATE CRIMES AND GUN VIOLENCE Last year, a single gunman killed 23 individuals in El Paso. He picked this city because of its diversity, rich Hispanic heritage, and close friendship with the people of Ciudad Juarez. This horrific tragedy, part of a disturbing increase in anti-Latino hate crimes, calls on all of us to recommit to the battle for the soul of the nation. According to the FBI, reported anti-Latino hate incidents increased by more than 40 percent between 2016 and 2018. We must fight against white supremacy, which President Trump has emboldened. And we must fight against gun violence in all of its forms , mass shootings and the daily acts of gun violence that don\u2019t make headlines but are just as tragic for the families and communities affected. Biden will pursue evidence-based measures to root out persistent violent crime and hate crimes. Violent offenders need to be held accountable, and survivors need to have access to support to deal with the physical, psychological, and financial consequences of violence. Biden will tackle the rise in hate crimes through moral leadership that makes clear such vitriol has no place in the United States. And, in the Biden Administration, the Justice Department will prioritize prosecuting hate crimes. Additionally, Biden will address the daily acts of gun violence in our communities that may not make national headlines, but are just as devastating to survivors and victims\u2019 families as gun violence that does make the front page. These daily acts of gun violence disproportionately impact Latinos and Black people. Biden will create a $900 million, eight-year initiative to fund evidence-based interventions in 40 cities across the country , the 20 cities with the highest number of homicides, and 20 cities with the highest number of homicides per capita. This proposal is estimated to save more than 12,000 lives over the eight-year program. Read Biden\u2019s full plan to reduce gun violence at joebiden.com\/gunsafety. SECURE OUR VALUES AS A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS Trump has waged an unrelenting assault on our values and our history as a nation of immigrants. It\u2019s wrong, and it stops when Biden is elected President. The current Administration\u2019s racist and wrong-headed immigration policies have created a humanitarian crisis on our border, undermined a key source of our economic strength, and weakened our moral standing in the world. Biden knows that it\u2019s past time to overhaul our broken immigration system. As Vice President, he backed reforms that would have established a path to citizenship and when Congress failed to pass them, the Obama-Biden Administration created and then expanded the DACA program to give Dreamers a chance to pursue their lives without fear of deportation. On his first day in office, Biden will send to Congress a bill for legislative immigration reform that will modernize our immigration system and give nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants a roadmap to citizenship. Biden knows that we can secure our borders and uphold our laws in a way that is humane, just, and that establishes a rational set of rules for aspiring immigrants. He will invest in smart technology that addresses the real threats to U.S. security, ones that primarily come to our country through our legal ports of entry, and he\u2019ll restore our asylum system so that it once more offers protection and safe harbor to people fleeing dangers. He\u2019ll ensure those seeking refuge in the United States are treated with dignity and get the fair hearing they\u2019re legally entitled to receive, and surge the resources to hire more immigration judges and asylum officers to address the current crisis. Moreover, a Biden Administration will immediately review every Temporary Protected Status (TPS) decision made by the Trump Administration to ensure that no one is returned to a country that is not safe, extend TPS to Venezuelans seeking relief from the humanitarian crisis brought on by the Maduro regime, and offer TPS recipients who have been in the country for an extended period of time a path to citizenship through legislative immigration reform. Reverse the Harmful Immigration Policies of the Trump Administration As President, Biden will take urgent action to end the Trump Administration\u2019s violations of human dignity and restore our nation\u2019s moral leadership by:Permanent Immigration Reform Through Legislative Action As President, Biden will commit significant political capital to finally deliver legislative immigration reform to ensure that the U.S. remains open and welcoming to people from every part of the world , and to bring hardworking people who have enriched our communities and our country, in some cases for decades, out of the shadows. Specifically, Joe Biden will work with Congress to pass legislation that:Read Biden\u2019s full immigration plan at joebiden.com\/immigration.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@JoeBiden\/the-biden-agenda-for-the-latino-community-4d7329c2644b?source=user_profile---------18----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Joe Biden believes that the story of America is one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. The Latino community is a core part of the American community and their contributions are evident in every part of society. Our nation's ability to draw and welcome hard-working, aspirational people from every culture, from every nation is an indisputable strength. Our diversity is the source of America's constant renewal , the reason we've been able to remake ourselves over and over. President Trump's assault on Latino dignity started on the very first day of his campaign. His assault doesn't just reveal itself in the betrayal of the Dreamers or in the pardoning of a sheriff who has terrorized the Latino community. It's in the underfunding of schools, in attacks on labor and the ability of workers to bargain for their worth, and in the neglect of Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria. Trump's strategy is to sow division , to cast out Latinos as being less than fully American. As President, Biden will ensure everyone is treated with dignity , no matter their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or zip code. And, he will ensure that everyone has a chance to join the middle class, including Latinos and other individuals never given a fair shot in decades past. Today, a full quarter of all children in the U.S. are Latino. Our collective success depends upon the success of the Latino community. Biden will be ready beginning on Day 1 to implement changes needed for the Latino community to thrive. Biden will:Additionally, in recognition of the unique contributions of Latinos to American history over the past 500 years, Biden will work to establish a Smithsonian National American Latino Museum. Latino history is intricately woven into the history of America and must be preserved and celebrated. These vast contributions are long overdue to be recognized in the family of Smithsonian Museums. As an initial step, Biden will initiate a feasibility study and a site location for the museum. In July 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives passed by voice vote , on a bipartisan basis , an act to establish this museum. Biden will also ensure that political appointees, including the President's Cabinet, look like the country they serve, and ensure that our federal workforce is representative of the demographics in our country. The Obama-Biden Administration made great progress in building a diverse federal workforce, but Biden knows work remains for the country to fully realize the benefits of the talents, abilities, and perspectives of a workforce that looks like the country. As President, Biden will nominate and appoint people who look like the country they serve and share Biden's commitment to rigorous enforcement of civil rights protections. This includes promoting diverse leadership for all federal agencies including the financial regulatory agencies that have a direct impact on the nature of our entire economic system; working with all branches of government, including the Senate and Supreme Court, to create best practices and standards for ensuring racial diversity among clerks, staffers, and interns; and creating a new post within the White House's Council of Economic Advisers to focus on racial equity including the income and wealth gaps. He also will reissue and mandate strict compliance with the Obama-Biden executive order to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal government. He will rebuild the pipeline of workers into the federal government and incentivize more qualified workers to choose public service by forgiving $10,000 a year in student debt for up to five years of public service. He'll tap into the best and brightest talent from every source by developing career pipelines from Hispanic-serving Institutions and other Minority-serving Institutions into federal agencies. Biden will also provide more training and mentoring opportunities to improve retention, and collect better data about who is applying for federal service positions as well as being promoted. INVESTING IN LATINOS' ECONOMIC MOBILITY Latinos fill essential roles throughout our economy. But many Latinos are stuck in low-wage jobs and have lower rates of homeownership and less wealth in comparison to non-Hispanic whites. Biden is running for president to rebuild the middle class so that this time, everyone comes along, including Latinos. Supporting Public-Private Investment Through a New Small Business Opportunity Plan Small business ownership is one of our country's cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. However, persistent racial disparities in wealth and access to capital, combined with outright discrimination in the financial sector, have contributed to inequities in small business ownership, growth, and success. For example, Latinos are roughly 18% of the U.S. population but own less than 6% of small businesses with employees. Latino-owned firms also report lack of collateral as a top reason for credit denial. To address the racial wealth gap, the opportunity gap, and the jobs gap for Latinos, Biden will launch a historic effort to empower small business creation and expansion in economically disadvantaged areas , particularly for Latino-owned businesses and businesses owned by other people of color. In addition to providing small businesses with an ambitious 'restart package' to survive the current crisis and come out the other side strong, he is proposing a special, ongoing initiative to empower these entrepreneurs to succeed and grow with a three-prong Small Business Opportunity Plan. His plan is consistent with key elements in the Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act recently proposed by Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer, Mark Warner, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. Biden will:Reforming Opportunity Zones to Ensure They Serve Latino Communities, Small Businesses, and Homeowners Like many Americans, Biden initially hoped that Opportunity Zones would be structured and administered by the Trump Administration in a way that advanced racial equity, small business creation, and homeownership in low-income urban, rural, and tribal communities. It is now clear that the Trump Administration has failed to deliver on that promise in too many places around America. As the Urban Institute has found, the program as a whole is 'not living up to its economic and community development goals.' While there have been positive examples, in too many instances investors favor high-return projects like luxury apartments over affordable housing and local entrepreneurs. We cannot close the racial wealth gap if we allow billionaires to exploit Opportunity Zones tax breaks to pad their wealth, rather than investing in projects that benefit distressed low-income communities and Americans that are struggling to make ends meet. As President, Biden will task his team to develop a plan for reforming Opportunity Zones, including steps like incentivizing Opportunity Funds to partner with nonprofit or community-oriented organizations and jointly produce a community-benefit plan for each investment. The focus should be on creating jobs for low-income residents and otherwise providing a direct financial impact to households within the Opportunity Zones. Make A Historic Commitment To Equalizing Federal Procurement Biden's Build Back Better plan includes a historic procurement effort designed to support small businesses and tackle long standing inequities in the federal contracting system. During his first term, Biden will tighten Buy American requirements for existing procurement and invest $400 billion in additional federal purchases of products made by American workers. And, he will make transparent, targeted investments that unleash new demand for domestic goods and services and create American jobs in communities across the country. As part of this effort, his multi-pronged small business contracting strategy will include formula-based awards; widespread outreach and counseling to small business owners, especially Latino business owners and other business owners of color; and transparent, frequent monitoring of contract awards. This will make certain that the largest mobilization of public investments in procurement, infrastructure, and R&D since WWII is equitably distributed across communities and businesses. Biden will also take concrete steps to streamline the federal procurement process as a whole and ensure it finally mirrors the demographics of this country. Specifically, Biden will require prime contractors to develop and fully execute plans to increase subcontracting opportunities for small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs). He will also triple the federal goal for contracting with SDBs from 5% to a minimum of 15% of all procurement dollars by 2025. To achieve this goal, which will send tens of billions of additional dollars to Latino communities and other communities of color, Biden will expand long-term technical assistance and federal contracting preferences for SDBs. And, he will incentivize state and local governments and private sector partners to contract with small disadvantaged businesses. Throughout, Biden will ensure federal dollars support Latino workers and their families. As called for in his plan to strengthen worker organizing, collective bargaining, and unions, Biden will require that all companies receiving procurement contracts are using taxpayer dollars to support good American jobs, including a commitment to pay at least $15 per hour, provide paid leave, maintain fair overtime and scheduling practices, and guarantee a choice to join a union and bargain collectively. Ensure Latino Workers are Compensated Fairly and Treated With Dignity This pandemic has shown the world who essential workers really are , and many of them are Latino workers who feed the country, keep our communities clean, and care for our loved ones. But for too long they have not been treated with dignity or provided with the opportunity they deserve. Latino workers still earn a fraction of what white workers earn and are less likely to have essential benefits like health coverage and paid leave. And Latinas earn only 54 cents for every dollar a white man earns, adding up, on average, to over $1.1 million over a lifetime career. This is especially detrimental for the more than four in ten Latina mothers who are the sole or primary breadwinners for their family. Biden's plan to build back better requires rooting out discrimination in the workplace so people can earn what they deserve, support their families, and build wealth. Biden will continue to prioritize closing wage gaps and ending paycheck discrimination. He will increase the federal minimum wage to $15 across the country and eliminate the minimum tipped wage, disproportionately benefitting Latino workers. He will also support small businesses like restaurants during this economic crisis, helping them get back on their feet so they can keep their doors open and pay their workers. The Obama-Biden Administration fought to extend overtime pay to over 4 million workers and protect nearly 9 million from losing it, but the Trump Administration reversed this progress, implementing a new rule that leaves millions of workers behind , including nearly 1.3 million Latino workers. Biden will ensure workers are paid fairly for the long hours they work and get the overtime pay they deserve. And he will ensure that domestic workers and farm workers receive overtime protections. Biden will address discrimination and harassment in the workplace, guarantee up to 12 weeks paid family and medical leave for all workers and up to seven days of paid sick, family, and safe leave. Approximately one in three Latino workers have experienced employment discrimination and nearly one in two Latino workers do not have access to any paid leave. And Biden will make it easier for all workers to organize unions and bargain collectively. Unions are an essential path to the middle class, especially for Latinos. They allow workers to bargain for higher wages and benefits, and with more job protections, many union workers have greater job stability. In fact, Latinos who join a union receive an even larger pay increase than white workers who join a union, helping to close the wage gap, and one study found Latino union members have 11 times the wealth of Latino non-union members. Biden will include in the economic recovery legislation he sends to Congress a series of policies to build worker power to raise wages and secure stronger benefits. This legislation will make it easier for workers to organize a union and bargain collectively with their employers by including the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, card check, union and bargaining rights for public service workers, and a broad definition of 'employee' and tough enforcement to end the misclassification of workers as independent contractors. It will also go further than the PRO Act by holding company executives personally liable when they interfere with organizing efforts. And, Biden will restore the ability of federal workers to unionize and collectively bargain.

Millions of Americans have already lost their health insurance because they lost their job, and millions more may find health care increasingly difficult to afford. During this crisis, Biden would expand access to quality, affordable health care for all through:Ensuring access to affordable, high-quality health care beyond the crisis Because of Obamacare, over 100 million people no longer have to worry that an insurance company will deny coverage or charge higher premiums just because they have a pre-existing condition , whether cancer or diabetes or heart disease or a mental health challenge. Insurance companies can no longer set annual or lifetime limits on coverage. Millions of Latinos obtained the peace of mind that comes with health insurance. Young people who are in transition from school to a job have the option to stay covered by their parents' plan until age 26. As a result, the uninsured rate among Latinos plummeted from 32% to 19% in the wake of Obamacare , the most substantial decrease of any racial or ethnic group. Now, in the middle of a pandemic, Trump is trying to strip away all health care protections for the millions of Latinos who depend on the Affordable Care Act. If President Trump is successful in his efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act, some estimates show that one in ten Latinos under age 65 will lose their health insurance. As President, Biden will build on Obamacare to expand Latinos' access to quality, affordable care. Investing in Hispanic-serving Institutions to Help Solve Health Disparities As part of Biden's more than $70 billion investment in Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs), other Minority-serving Institutions (MSIs), and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), he will invest $10 billion to create at least 200 new centers of excellence that serve as research incubators and connect students underrepresented in fields critical to our nation's future to learning and career opportunities. He will develop robust internship and career pipelines at major research agencies, including National Institutes of Health. He will also dedicate additional and increased priority funding streams at federal agencies for grants and contracts for HSIs, other MSIs, and HBCUs. He will require any federal research grants to universities with an endowment of over $1 billion to form a meaningful partnership and enter into a 10% minimum subcontract with an HSI, other MSI, or HBCU. And, Biden will invest $5 billion in graduate programs in health care, along with teaching and STEM, at these schools. Read Biden's full health care plan at EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING, AND TACKLE RACIAL INEQUITY IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM Over a quarter of K-12 public school students are Latino. Biden will make sure that every child in America has the chance to realize their full potential starting at birth, regardless of their zip code, race, or family income. Biden will work with states to ensure every low- and middle-income family has access to high-quality child care and to make high-quality pre-K available to every child. He'll close the gap between white and non-white school districts by nearly tripling Title I funding, the federal program funding schools with a high percentage of students from low-income families. This new funding will first be used to ensure teachers at Title I schools are paid competitively, three- and four-year olds have access to pre-school, and districts provide access to rigorous coursework , including computer science and other STEM subjects , across all their schools, not just a few. He'll expand 'community schools' that serve the needs of students and parents; and double the number of school psychologists, nurses, school counselors, and social workers, giving kids the support they need to grow. Biden will work to ensure that more public schools have additional resources to support English learners and ensure their parents receive information in the language they understand so they can participate in their child's education. And, through partnerships between high schools, community colleges, and employers, Biden will make sure that all kids have a chance to graduate with an industry credential, ready to compete in the 21st century workforce. Biden will also expand access for Latinos to quality, affordable education and training beyond high school. For too many, earning a degree or other credential after high school is unaffordable today. For others, their education saddles them with so much debt it prevents them from buying a home or saving for retirement, or their parents or grandparents take on some of the financial burden. But roughly six in ten jobs require some education beyond high school.

He picked this city because of its diversity, rich Hispanic heritage, and close friendship with the people of Ciudad Juarez. This horrific tragedy, part of a disturbing increase in anti-Latino hate crimes, calls on all of us to recommit to the battle for the soul of the nation. According to the FBI, reported anti-Latino hate incidents increased by more than 40 percent between 2016 and 2018. We must fight against white supremacy, which President Trump has emboldened. And we must fight against gun violence in all of its forms , mass shootings and the daily acts of gun violence that don't make headlines but are just as tragic for the families and communities affected. Biden will pursue evidence-based measures to root out persistent violent crime and hate crimes. Violent offenders need to be held accountable, and survivors need to have access to support to deal with the physical, psychological, and financial consequences of violence. Biden will tackle the rise in hate crimes through moral leadership that makes clear such vitriol has no place in the United States. And, in the Biden Administration, the Justice Department will prioritize prosecuting hate crimes. Additionally, Biden will address the daily acts of gun violence in our communities that may not make national headlines, but are just as devastating to survivors and victims' families as gun violence that does make the front page. These daily acts of gun violence disproportionately impact Latinos and Black people. Biden will create a $900 million, eight-year initiative to fund evidence-based interventions in 40 cities across the country , the 20 cities with the highest number of homicides, and 20 cities with the highest number of homicides per capita. This proposal is estimated to save more than 12,000 lives over the eight-year program. Read Biden's full plan to reduce gun violence at SECURE OUR VALUES AS A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS Trump has waged an unrelenting assault on our values and our history as a nation of immigrants. It's wrong, and it stops when Biden is elected President. The current Administration's racist and wrong-headed immigration policies have created a humanitarian crisis on our border, undermined a key source of our economic strength, and weakened our moral standing in the world. Biden knows that it's past time to overhaul our broken immigration system. As Vice President, he backed reforms that would have established a path to citizenship and when Congress failed to pass them, the Obama-Biden Administration created and then expanded the DACA program to give Dreamers a chance to pursue their lives without fear of deportation. On his first day in office, Biden will send to Congress a bill for legislative immigration reform that will modernize our immigration system and give nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants a roadmap to citizenship. Biden knows that we can secure our borders and uphold our laws in a way that is humane, just, and that establishes a rational set of rules for aspiring immigrants. He will invest in smart technology that addresses the real threats to U.S. security, ones that primarily come to our country through our legal ports of entry, and he'll restore our asylum system so that it once more offers protection and safe harbor to people fleeing dangers. He'll ensure those seeking refuge in the United States are treated with dignity and get the fair hearing they're legally entitled to receive, and surge the resources to hire more immigration judges and asylum officers to address the current crisis. Moreover, a Biden Administration will immediately review every Temporary Protected Status (TPS) decision made by the Trump Administration to ensure that no one is returned to a country that is not safe, extend TPS to Venezuelans seeking relief from the humanitarian crisis brought on by the Maduro regime, and offer TPS recipients who have been in the country for an extended period of time a path to citizenship through legislative immigration reform. Reverse the Harmful Immigration Policies of the Trump Administration As President, Biden will take urgent action to end the Trump Administration's violations of human dignity and restore our nation's moral leadership by:Permanent Immigration Reform Through Legislative Action As President, Biden will commit significant political capital to finally deliver legislative immigration reform to ensure that the U.S. remains open and welcoming to people from every part of the world , and to bring hardworking people who have enriched our communities and our country, in some cases for decades, out of the shadows. Specifically, Joe Biden will work with Congress to pass legislation that:Read Biden's full immigration plan at"}

This national treasure attracts millions of visitors each year, supporting thousands of jobs for Arizonans and contributing more than $1 billion to the state economy. But where virtually every American sees an irreplaceable jewel, Donald Trump sees yet another opportunity to fracture something inviolable for profit. By opening the door to mining companies to extract uranium from the Grand Canyon, Trump is threatening to deface the natural splendor of our nation, poison the land and water relied on by local communities, and drive a drill into the heart of one of Arizona\u2019s cultural and economic cornerstones.

Now, instead of staying in Washington and working with Republicans and Democrats to reach a bipartisan deal, President Trump is at his golf club in New Jersey signing a series of dubious executive orders.This is no art of the deal. This is not presidential leadership. These orders are not real solutions. They are just another cynical ploy designed to deflect responsibility. Some measures do far more harm than good.One order is Donald Trump\u2019s first shot in a new, reckless war on Social Security. Trump announced a payroll tax plan with no protections or guarantees , like the ones the Obama-Biden administration enforced a decade ago , that the Social Security Trust Fund will be made whole. And, Trump specifically stated today that if re-elected, he plans to undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security. He is laying out his roadmap to cutting Social Security. Our seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without Trump putting their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt.Another order brings cuts, chaos, and confusion to our system of unemployment insurance. Trump is unilaterally reducing the amount laid-off workers could receive. And he purports to provide these benefits until the end of the year, but only identifies enough funding to make it a handful of weeks. Even with that limited funding, Trump is basically playing a cruel game of robbing Peter to pay Paul: He is taking billions of dollars of federal natural disaster funding away so it won\u2019t be available to states like Florida. And, he is forcing states to choose between imposing benefit cuts for unemployed workers or slashing funds for public schools, health workers, and first responders.A third order, on evictions, is woefully inadequate to deal with the emerging housing crisis. He is leaving our nation\u2019s renters with ever-mounting debt and leaving our small family landlords badly squeezed. Without a comprehensive plan to help our American families make rent, they will leave this crisis months behind on their payments while many landlords teeter on the verge of bankruptcy.And a fourth order is a band-aid approach to student debt that leaves out 7 million borrowers who obtained their federal loans from private lenders or their college rather than the Department. The economic strain on these Americans is deep and unrelenting.There is a solution to all of this pain and suffering.

Today, America is facing a new moment of extraordinary suffering and economic calamity. It is a moment that impels us, perhaps more than any in recent memory, to strengthen our commitment to Social Security and the promise for which it stands , to protect the most vulnerable and help every American family guard against uncertainty and loss. Instead of rising to the moment, President Trump is threatening to sever that sacred promise. Last week, from his golf course in New Jersey, he issued an executive order to \u201cterminate\u201d the funding Social Security relies on. Since then, he\u2019s only doubled down , vowing in no uncertain terms to end Social Security as we know it if given another term in office. This is not a matter of campaign hyperbole or difference of opinion. It is a stone-cold fact: Trump announced his intention to permanently cut the funding source for Social Security , the payroll taxes that American workers pay into, trusting that Social Security will be there for them when they retire. When asked how he planned to make up for that funding, Trump said: \u201ctremendous growth.\u201d That\u2019s the same magical fix he promised would pay for his tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans back in 2017. That \u201ctremendous growth\u201d never materialized, and instead his mismanagement spiraled our nation into the worst economic and jobs crisis in a century. Like his \u2018tremendous health care plan,\u2019 his \u2018tremendous infrastructure plan,\u2019 and every other promise he has thoughtlessly made and broken, this too will turn out to be worthless , and millions of seniors will be left to face the challenges of aging without the support, peace of mind, and dignity they had counted on and earned. To slash Social Security in the midst of a deadly pandemic , a crisis made exponentially worse by his own negligence , is an unconscionable betrayal of American seniors, who paid into the Social Security system throughout their lives expecting it would be there for them in their golden years. It isn\u2019t a surprise that Donald Trump is promising to gut Social Security at a time when families need help the most , after all, he\u2019s also in court right now trying to slash Medicare benefits for some of the most vulnerable Americans.

We will contain the virus and get people back to work, school, and their everyday lives. We will get them the support they need to come back from the edge. And, we will build back better with an economy that advances racial equity and breaks down barriers that have left so many women, especially Black women, unseen, underpaid, and undervalued. We will champion Black women. We will move closer to equal pay , by holding employers accountable, making wage gaps more transparent, banning salary history to set future wages, and easing the ability for workers to organize and bargain collectively.We will build back better because Black women are the backbones of their families, communities, our economy, and our country. And we will ensure they earn the pay, and the dignity and respect they deserve."}
