{"SpeechID":"MEKH281201940","POTUS":"Kamala Harris","Date":"2019-01-28","SpeechTitle":"Our America","RawText":"Transcript of Senator Kamala Harris\u2019 launch speech in Oakland, California.I am so proud to be a daughter of Oakland, California. And as most of you know, I was born just up the road at Kaiser Hospital. And it was just a few miles away my parents first met as graduate students at UC Berkeley where they were active in the civil rights movement.They were born half a world apart from each other. My father, Donald, came from Jamaica to study economics. My mother, Shyamala, came from India to study the science of fighting disease.They came here in pursuit of more than just knowledge. Like so many others, they came in pursuit of a dream. And that dream was a dream for themselves, for me and for my sister Maya.As children growing up here in the East Bay, we were raised by a community with a deep belief in the promise of our country , and, a deep understanding of the parts of that promise that still remain unfulfilled.We were raised in a community where we were taught to see a world, beyond just ourselves. To be conscious and compassionate about the struggles of all people.We were raised to believe public service is a noble cause and the fight for justice is everyone\u2019s responsibility.In fact, my mother used to say \u201cdon\u2019t sit around and complain about things, do something.\u201d Basically I think she was saying. You\u2019ve got to get up and stand up and don\u2019t give up the fight!And it is this deep-rooted belief that inspired me to become a lawyer and a prosecutor.It was just a couple blocks from this very spot that nearly 30 years ago as a young district attorney I walked into the courtroom for the very first time and said the five words that would guide my life\u2019s work:\u201cKamala Harris, for the people.\u201dNow, I knew our criminal justice system was deeply flawed.But I also knew the profound impact law enforcement has on people\u2019s lives, and it\u2019s responsibility to give them safety and dignity.I knew I wanted to protect people.And I knew that the people in our society who are most often targeted by predators are also most often the voiceless and vulnerable.And I believed then as I do now, that no one should be left to fight alone.You see, in our system of justice, we believe that a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. That\u2019s why when we file a case, it\u2019s not filed in the name of the victim. It reads, \u201cThe People.\u201dThis is a point I have often explained to console and counsel survivors of crime, people who faced great harm. Often at the hands of someone they trust , be it a relative or a bank or a big corporation.I would remind them. You are not invisible. We all stand together.That\u2019s the power of the people.My whole life, I\u2019ve only had one client: the people.Fighting for the people meant fighting on behalf of survivors of sexual assault , a fight not just against predators but a fight against silence and stigma.For the people meant fighting for a more fair criminal justice system.At a time when prevention and redemption were not in the vocabulary or mindset of most district attorneys, we created an initiative to get skills and job training instead of jail time for young people arrested for drugs.For the people meant fighting for middle-class families who had been defrauded by banks and were losing their homes by the millions in the Great Recession.And I\u2019ll tell you, sitting across the table from the big banks, I witnessed the arrogance of power. Wealthy bankers accusing innocent homeowners of fault, as if Wall Street\u2019s mess was of the people\u2019s making.So we went after the five biggest banks in the United States. We won 20 billion dollars for California homeowners and together we passed the strongest anti-foreclosure law in the United States of America. We did that together.For the people meant fighting transnational gangs who traffic in drugs and guns and human beings. And I saw their sophistication, their persistence, and their ruthlessness.And folks, on the subject of transnational gangs, let\u2019s be perfectly clear: the President\u2019s medieval vanity project is not going to stop them.And in the fight for the people to hold this administration accountable, I have seen the amazing spirit of the American people.During the health care fight, I saw parents and children with grave illnesses walk the halls of the United States Congress, families who had traveled across the country at incredible sacrifice.They came to our nation\u2019s capital believing that if their stories were heard, and if they were seen, their leaders would do the right thing.I saw the same thing with our Dreamers. They came by the thousands. By plane, train, and automobile. I\u2019m sure they were sleeping ten-deep on someone\u2019s living room floor.They came because they believe in our democracy and the only country they\u2019ve ever known as home.I met survivors who shared their deepest, most painful personal experiences , who told stories they had never before revealed, even to their closest loved ones , because they believed that if they were seen, that their leaders would do the right thing and protect the highest court in our land.Together we took on these battles.To be sure we\u2019ve won and we\u2019ve lost, but we\u2019ve never stopped fighting.And that\u2019s why we are here today.We are here because we have another battle ahead.We are here knowing that we are at an inflection point in the history of our world.We are at an inflection point in the history of our nation.We are here because the American Dream and our American democracy are under attack and on the line like never before.We are here at this moment in time because we must answer a fundamental question.Who are we? Who are we as Americans?So, let\u2019s answer that question. To the world. And each other. Right here. And, right now.America, we are better than this.When we have leaders who lie and bully and attack a free press and undermine our democratic institutions, that\u2019s not our America.When white supremacists march and murder in Charlottesville or massacre innocent worshipers at a Pittsburgh synagogue, that\u2019s not our America.When we have children in cages crying for their mothers and fathers, don\u2019t you dare call it border security, that\u2019s a human rights abuse and that\u2019s not our America.When we have leaders who attack public schools and vilify public school teachers, that\u2019s not our America.When bankers who crashed our economy get bonuses but workers who brought our country back can\u2019t even get a raise that\u2019s not our America.And when American families are barely living paycheck to paycheck, what is this administration\u2019s response?Their response is to try to take away health care from millions of families.Their response is to give away a trillion dollars to the biggest corporations in this country.And their response is to blame immigrants as the source of all our problems.And guys lets understand what is happening here: People in power are trying to convince us that the villain in our American story is each other.But that is not our story. That is not who we are. That\u2019s not our America.Our United States of America is not about us versus them. It\u2019s about We the people!And in this moment, we must all speak truth about what\u2019s happening.Seek truth, speak truth and fight for the truth.So let\u2019s speak some truth. Shall we?Let\u2019s speak truth about our economy. Our economy today is not working for working people.The cost of living is going up, but paychecks aren\u2019t keeping up.For so many Americans, a decent retirement feels out of reach and the American Dream feels out of touch.The truth, is our people are drowning in debt.Record student loan debt. Car loan debt. Credit card debt. Resorting to payday lenders because you can\u2019t keep up with the bills.People are drowning in America.We have a whole generation of Americans living with the sinking fear that they won\u2019t do as well as their parents.Let\u2019s speak another truth about our economy. Women are paid on average 80 cents on the dollar. Black women, 63 cents. Latinas, 53 cents.And here\u2019s the thing. When we lift up the women of our country, we lift up the children of our country. We lift up the families of our country. And the whole of society benefits.Let\u2019s speak another truth. Big pharmaceutical companies have unleashed an opioid crisis from the California coast to the mountains of West Virginia. And people once and for all we have got to call drug addiction for what it is: a national public health emergency. And we don\u2019t need another War on Drugs.Let\u2019s speak truth. Climate change is real and it is happening now. From wildfires In the west to hurricanes in the east, to floods and droughts in the heartland, we\u2019re not gonna buy the lie. We\u2019re gonna act, based on science fact, not science fiction.And let\u2019s speak an uncomfortable but honest truth with one another: racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, transphobia are real in this country. They are age-old forms of hate with new fuel. And we need to speak that truth so we can deal with it.Let\u2019s speak the truth that too many unarmed black men and women are killed in America. Too many black and brown Americans are locked up. From mass incarceration to cash bail to policing, our criminal justice system needs drastic repair. Let\u2019s speak that truth.Let\u2019s speak truth. Under this administration, America\u2019s position in the world has never been weaker. Democratic values are under attack around the globe. When authoritarianism is on the march. When nuclear proliferation is on the rise. We have foreign powers infecting the White House like malware. Let us speak truth about these clear and present dangers.And let\u2019s speak the biggest truth, the biggest truth of all: In the face of powerful forces trying to sow hate and division among us, the truth is that as Americans we have much more in common than what separates us. Let\u2019s speak that truth.So, let\u2019s not buy into that stuff that they are trying to peddle. Let\u2019s never forget, that on the fundamental issues, we all have so much more in common than what separates us.You know, some say we need to search to find that common ground. Here\u2019s what I say, I say we need to recognize that we are already standing on common ground.I say we will rise together or we will fall together as one nation, indivisible.And I want to be perfectly clear: I\u2019m not talking about unity for the sake of unity. Hear me out. I\u2019m not talking about unity for the sake of unity.I\u2019m not talking about some fa\u00e7ade of unity.And I believe we must acknowledge that the word unity has often been used to shut people up or to preserve the status quo. After all let\u2019s remember: when women fought for suffrage, those in power said they were dividing the sexes and disturbing the peace.Let\u2019s remember: when abolitionists spoke out and civil rights workers marched, their oppressors said they were dividing the races and violating the word of God.But Fredrick Douglass said it best and Harriet Tubman and Dr. King knew.To love the religion of Jesus is to hate the religion of the slave master.When we have true unity, no one will be subjugated for others. It\u2019s about fighting for a country with equal treatment, collective purpose, and freedom for all.That\u2019s who we are.And so, I stand before you today, clear-eyed about the fight ahead and what has to be done , with faith in God, with fidelity to country, and with the fighting spirit I got from my mother. I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.I\u2019m running for president because I love my country. I love my country.I\u2019m running to be president, of the people, by the people, and for all people.I\u2019m running to fight for an America where the economy works for working people.For an America where you only have to work one job to pay the bills, where hard work is rewarded and where any worker can join a union.I am running to declare, once and for all, that health care is a fundamental right, and we will deliver that right with Medicare for All!I am running to declare education is a fundamental right, and we will guarantee that right with universal pre-k and debt-free college!I am running to guarantee working and middle-class families an overdue pay increase. We will deliver the largest working and middle-class tax cut in a generation. Up to $500 a month to help America\u2019s families make ends meet.And we\u2019ll pay for it by reversing this administration\u2019s giveaways to big corporations and the top one percent.I\u2019m running to fight for an America where our democracy and its institutions are protected against all enemies, foreign and domestic.Which is why I will defend this nation against all threats to our cybersecurity.We will secure our elections and our critical infrastructure to protect our democracy.And we will honor our service members and veterans , so no one who has served this country has to wait in line for weeks and months to get what they are owed when they return home on first day.I\u2019m running to fight for an America where no mother or father has to teach their young son that people may stop him, arrest him, chase him, or kill him, because of his race.An America where every parent can send their children to school without being haunted by the horror of another killing spree.Where we treat attacks on voting rights and civil rights and women\u2019s rights and immigrant rights as attacks on our country itself.An America where we welcome refugees and bring people out of the shadows, and provide a pathway to citizenship.An America where our daughters, where our sisters, where our mothers and grandmothers are respected where they live and where they work.Where reproductive rights are not just protected by the Constitution of the United States but guaranteed in every state.I\u2019ll fight for an America where we keep our word and where we honor our promises. Because that\u2019s our America. That\u2019s the America I believe in. That\u2019s the America I know we believe in.And as we embark on this campaign, I will tell you this: I am not perfect. Lord knows, I am not perfect. But I will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect. I will lead with integrity. And I will speak the truth.And of course, we know this is not going to be easy guys. It\u2019s not going to be easy.We know what the doubters will say.It\u2019s the same thing they\u2019ve always said.They\u2019ll say it\u2019s not your time. They\u2019ll say wait your turn. They\u2019ll say the odds are long. They\u2019ll say it can\u2019t be done.But America\u2019s story has always been written by people who can see what can be unburdened by what has been. That is our story. That is our story.As Robert Kennedy many years ago said, \u201cOnly those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.\u201dHe also said, \u201cI do not lightly dismiss the dangers and the difficulties of challenging an incumbent President, but these are not ordinary times and this is not an ordinary election.\u201d He said, \u201cAt stake is not simply the leadership of our party and even our country. It is our right to moral leadership of this planet.\u201dSo today I say to you my friends, these are not ordinary times. And this will not be an ordinary election. But this is our America.And here\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s up to us.It\u2019s up to us. Each and every one of us.So let\u2019s remember in this fight we have the power of the people.We can achieve the dreams of our parents and grandparents.We can heal our nation.We can give our children the future they deserve.We can reclaim the American Dream for every single person in our country.We can restore America\u2019s moral leadership on this planet.So let\u2019s do this.And let\u2019s do it together.And let\u2019s start now.Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/kamalaharris.medium.com\/our-america-4642b443d529?source=user_profile---------49----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"I am so proud to be a daughter of Oakland, California.

And, right now.America, we are better than this.When we have leaders who lie and bully and attack a free press and undermine our democratic institutions, that's not our America.When white supremacists march and murder in Charlottesville or massacre innocent worshipers at a Pittsburgh synagogue, that's not our America.When we have children in cages crying for their mothers and fathers, don't you dare call it border security, that's a human rights abuse and that's not our America.When we have leaders who attack public schools and vilify public school teachers, that's not our America.When bankers who crashed our economy get bonuses but workers who brought our country back can't even get a raise that's not our America.And when American families are barely living paycheck to paycheck, what is this administration's response?Their response is to try to take away health care from millions of families.Their response is to give away a trillion dollars to the biggest corporations in this country.And their response is to blame immigrants as the source of all our problems.And guys lets understand what is happening here: People in power are trying to convince us that the villain in our American story is each other.But that is not our story. That is not who we are. That's not our America.Our United States of America is not about us versus them. It's about We the people!And in this moment, we must all speak truth about what's happening.Seek truth, speak truth and fight for the truth.So let's speak some truth. Shall we?Let's speak truth about our economy. Our economy today is not working for working people.The cost of living is going up, but paychecks aren't keeping up.For so many Americans, a decent retirement feels out of reach and the American Dream feels out of touch.The truth, is our people are drowning in debt.Record student loan debt. Car loan debt. Credit card debt. Resorting to payday lenders because you can't keep up with the bills.People are drowning in America.We have a whole generation of Americans living with the sinking fear that they won't do as well as their parents.Let's speak another truth about our economy. Women are paid on average 80 cents on the dollar. Black women, 63 cents. Latinas, 53 cents.And here's the thing. When we lift up the women of our country, we lift up the children of our country. We lift up the families of our country. And the whole of society benefits.Let's speak another truth. Big pharmaceutical companies have unleashed an opioid crisis from the California coast to the mountains of West Virginia. And people once and for all we have got to call drug addiction for what it is: a national public health emergency. And we don't need another War on Drugs.Let's speak truth. Climate change is real and it is happening now. From wildfires In the west to hurricanes in the east, to floods and droughts in the heartland, we're not gonna buy the lie. We're gonna act, based on science fact, not science fiction.And let's speak an uncomfortable but honest truth with one another: racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, transphobia are real in this country. They are age-old forms of hate with new fuel. And we need to speak that truth so we can deal with it.Let's speak the truth that too many unarmed black men and women are killed in America. Too many black and brown Americans are locked up. From mass incarceration to cash bail to policing, our criminal justice system needs drastic repair. Let's speak that truth.Let's speak truth. Under this administration, America's position in the world has never been weaker. Democratic values are under attack around the globe. When authoritarianism is on the march. When nuclear proliferation is on the rise. We have foreign powers infecting the White House like malware. Let us speak truth about these clear and present dangers.And let's speak the biggest truth, the biggest truth of all: In the face of powerful forces trying to sow hate and division among us, the truth is that as Americans we have much more in common than what separates us. Let's speak that truth.So, let's not buy into that stuff that they are trying to peddle. Let's never forget, that on the fundamental issues, we all have so much more in common than what separates us.You know, some say we need to search to find that common ground. Here's what I say, I say we need to recognize that we are already standing on common ground.I say we will rise together or we will fall together as one nation, indivisible.And I want to be perfectly clear: I'm not talking about unity for the sake of unity. Hear me out. I'm not talking about unity for the sake of unity.I'm not talking about some fa\ufffdade of unity.And I believe we must acknowledge that the word unity has often been used to shut people up or to preserve the status quo. After all let's remember: when women fought for suffrage, those in power said they were dividing the sexes and disturbing the peace.Let's remember: when abolitionists spoke out and civil rights workers marched, their oppressors said they were dividing the races and violating the word of God.But Fredrick Douglass said it best and Harriet Tubman and Dr. King knew.To love the religion of Jesus is to hate the religion of the slave master.When we have true unity, no one will be subjugated for others. It's about fighting for a country with equal treatment, collective purpose, and freedom for all.That's who we are.And so, I stand before you today, clear-eyed about the fight ahead and what has to be done , with faith in God, with fidelity to country, and with the fighting spirit I got from my mother. I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.I'm running for president because I love my country. I love my country.I'm running to be president, of the people, by the people, and for all people.I'm running to fight for an America where the economy works for working people.For an America where you only have to work one job to pay the bills, where hard work is rewarded and where any worker can join a union.I am running to declare, once and for all, that health care is a fundamental right, and we will deliver that right with Medicare for All!I am running to declare education is a fundamental right, and we will guarantee that right with universal pre-k and debt-free college!I am running to guarantee working and middle-class families an overdue pay increase. We will deliver the largest working and middle-class tax cut in a generation. Up to $500 a month to help America's families make ends meet.And we'll pay for it by reversing this administration's giveaways to big corporations and the top one percent.I'm running to fight for an America where our democracy and its institutions are protected against all enemies, foreign and domestic.Which is why I will defend this nation against all threats to our cybersecurity.We will secure our elections and our critical infrastructure to protect our democracy.And we will honor our service members and veterans , so no one who has served this country has to wait in line for weeks and months to get what they are owed when they return home on first day.I'm running to fight for an America where no mother or father has to teach their young son that people may stop him, arrest him, chase him, or kill him, because of his race.An America where every parent can send their children to school without being haunted by the horror of another killing spree.Where we treat attacks on voting rights and civil rights and women's rights and immigrant rights as attacks on our country itself.An America where we welcome refugees and bring people out of the shadows, and provide a pathway to citizenship.An America where our daughters, where our sisters, where our mothers and grandmothers are respected where they live and where they work.Where reproductive rights are not just protected by the Constitution of the United States but guaranteed in every state.I'll fight for an America where we keep our word and where we honor our promises. Because that's our America. That's the America I believe in. That's the America I know we believe in.And as we embark on this campaign, I will tell you this: I am not perfect. Lord knows, I am not perfect. But I will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect. I will lead with integrity. And I will speak the truth.And of course, we know this is not going to be easy guys. It's not going to be easy.We know what the doubters will say.It's the same thing they've always said.They'll say it's not your time. They'll say wait your turn. They'll say the odds are long. They'll say it can't be done.But America's story has always been written by people who can see what can be unburdened by what has been. That is our story. That is our story.As Robert Kennedy many years ago said, 'Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.'He also said, 'I do not lightly dismiss the dangers and the difficulties of challenging an incumbent President, but these are not ordinary times and this is not an ordinary election.' He said, 'At stake is not simply the leadership of our party and even our country. It is our right to moral leadership of this planet.'So today I say to you my friends, these are not ordinary times. And this will not be an ordinary election. But this is our America.And here's the thing. It's up to us.It's up to us. Each and every one of us.So let's remember in this fight we have the power of the people.We can achieve the dreams of our parents and grandparents.We can heal our nation.We can give our children the future they deserve.We can reclaim the American Dream for every single person in our country.We can restore America's moral leadership on this planet.So let's do this.And let's do it together.And let's start now.Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America."}

It should be about lifting people up.We then headed to our Las Vegas town hall, where more than 700 Nevadans joined us for a conversation about the big challenges facing our country right now , and how we all must come together at this inflection point in our nation's history to do what is right.We spoke about combating rising health care costs and what it will take to pass Medicare for All. How we are fighting for an America where you only have to work one job to pay the bills, where hard work is rewarded, and where any worker can join a union.And I spoke directly to a young girl in the audience who wondered what it's like to run for president. I told her that running for president is very uplifting because I get to meet the angels who walk among us: the people who could be doing a million other things but they choose to come to a town hall or get engaged.Your contributions are making it possible for us to build a winning campaign , and I am so grateful for your support.For The People,, Kamala"}

The announcement comes as the case of Jeffrey Epstein, who was indicted this week for sex trafficking and faces accusations of raping teenage girls, draws further scrutiny. On Tuesday, Harris called for Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, who as U.S. Attorney negotiated a sweetheart deal for Epstein, to resign. \u201cWe need leaders committed to fighting for justice for survivors of abuse, not protecting predators,\u201d she said.Harris\u2019 proposal would invest $1 billion to allow states to fully eliminate their rape-kit backlogs within four years and implement reforms to ensure a backlog does not happen again. On average, it costs $1,000 to $1,500 to test one rape kit. The annual estimated cost of the program is $100 million, which is $2 million less than what taxpayers have reportedly spent on President Trump\u2019s golf trips. Rape kits are used by medical professionals to collect evidence during a medical exam of a sexual assault victim in order to establish elements of a crime, and in the last decade, roughly 225,000 known untested rape kits have been uncovered.\u201cThe federal government can and should prioritize justice for survivors of sex abuse, assault, and rape,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAs California\u2019s Attorney General, I committed resources and attention to clearing a backlog of 1,300 untested rape kits at state-run labs, and we got it done within my first year in office.

{"SpeechID":"MEKH297201928","POTUS":"Kamala Harris","Date":"2019-07-29","SpeechTitle":"My Plan For Medicare For All","RawText":"One of the problems with our politics is that it often demands 60-second sound bites or slogans to answer complex questions. There is perhaps no more complicated or more personal issue for Americans than health care. I know this from my own personal life, caring for my mother as she battled colon cancer. And I also know it from talking to so many Americans in this campaign , seniors and union members, young people and parents, workers and caregivers. No panicked parent should hold a sick child while worrying about an expensive hospital bill. No senior should have to cut their pill in half just to make ends meet.Right now, the American health care system is a patchwork of plans, providers and costs that have left people frustrated, powerless and insurance companies in charge. And the bottom line is that health care just costs too much. So as a presidential candidate, here is where I stand to make transformative change for the better.Insurance companies and drug companies have jacked up prices so much that Americans, on average, pay twice what people in other countries pay for health care. Even though we spend more, we have failed to insure nearly 30 million Americans, and the problem has gotten worse under Donald Trump.Millions have lost their health insurance under his presidency, and 21 million risk losing coverage as this administration and their Republican allies try to overturn the Affordable Care Act in the courts. Between 2014 and 2017, 15,000 people died because Republican states decided not to expand Medicaid.The first thing the next Democratic president must do is end these senseless attacks on Obamacare. As someone who fought tooth and nail as Attorney General and as Senator to prevent repeal, that\u2019s exactly what I will continue to do.But we are also at a crisis point for health care in America. Big corporations are still putting profits over people\u2019s wellbeing, and Republicans are determined to destroy what progress we have made and put those same corporations back in charge of the system. The next Democratic president needs a clear, transformative, and achievable vision of how we finally change this broken system for good.I look at this issue through a fairly simple prism: each night, millions of Americans wake up at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning worried about some aspect of their health care. How am I going to afford a $5,000 deductible just for walking my child into the emergency room because their fever won\u2019t go down? How will I pay that surprise medical bill because the ambulance that took me to the hospital was out-of-network? How am I going to continue to see my doctor when I get a new job and my new insurance plan doesn\u2019t have them in their network?Imagine changing a job and not having to worry about your health care coverage. Imagine going to the pharmacy and not having to worry about an outrageous price increase on the prescription drug you need. Imagine walking through those sliding glass doors at the emergency room or doctor\u2019s office or hospital knowing that the first card you pull out will be a Medicare card, not a credit card.We need comprehensive health insurance that covers every American.Medicare works. It\u2019s popular. Seniors transition into it every day, and people keep their doctors and get care at a lower cost. Let\u2019s not lose sight that we have a Medicare system that\u2019s already working.Now, let\u2019s expand it to all Americans and give everyone access to comprehensive health care. Medicare for All will cover all medically necessary services, including emergency room visits, doctor visits, vision, dental, hearing aids, mental health, and substance use disorder treatment, and comprehensive reproductive health care services. It will also allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices.Under my Medicare for All plan, we will also expand the program to include other benefits Americans desperately need that will save money in the long run such as an expanded mental health program including telehealth and easier access to early diagnosis and treatment, and innovative patient programs to help people identify the right doctor and understand how to navigate the health system.And I\u2019ll institute a serious audit of prescription drug costs to ensure pharmaceutical companies are not charging more than other comparable countries, a comprehensive maternal child health program to dramatically reduce deaths among women and infants of color, and meaningful rural health care reforms, such as increasing residency slots for rural areas with workforce shortages and loan forgiveness for rural health care professionals, to promote high-quality access for people regardless of their zip code.But I am clear-eyed about the challenge of achieving this goal. It will not be easy, and it will not happen overnight. So here is my plan to get us there.First, when we pass my plan, all Americans will immediately have the ability to buy into Medicare. This is similar to the immediate, introductory buy-in provided in Senator Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All bill. Right away, it will lower costs and give us a baseline plan as we transition to Medicare for All.Second, we will set up an expanded Medicare system, with a 10-year phase-in period. During this transition, we will automatically enroll newborns and the uninsured into this new and improved Medicare system, give all doctors time to get into the system, and provide a commonsense path for employers, employees, the underinsured, and others on federally-designated programs, such as Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act exchanges, to transition. This will expand the number of insured Americans and create a new viable public system that guarantees universal coverage at a lower cost. Expanding the transition window will also lower the overall cost of the program.Third, in setting up this plan, we will allow private insurers to offer Medicare plans as a part of this system that adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits. This would function similar to how private Medicare plans work today, which cover about a third of Medicare seniors, and operate within the Medicare system. Medicare will set the rules of the road for these plans, including price and quality, and private insurance companies will play by those rules, not the other way around. This preserves the options that seniors have today and expands options to all Americans, while also telling insurance companies they don\u2019t run the show.Unlike the current system, private plans in the new Medicare system will be held to stricter consumer protection standards than they are today, such as getting reimbursed less than what the Medicare plan will cost to operate, to ensure that they are delivering meaningful value and unable to profit off of gaming consumers or the government. People will also be able to purchase supplemental insurance covering services not included in Medicare, such as medical insurance for traveling abroad, or cosmetic surgery.Essentially, we would allow private insurance to offer a plan in the Medicare system, but they will be subject to strict requirements to ensure it lowers costs and expands services. If they want to play by our rules, they can be in the system. If not, they have to get out.Throughout this entire period, I would also ensure the new system of Medicare for All meets clear benchmarks before asking people to join the plan. Has the public Medicare plan fulfilled its promise of high-quality coverage without unaffordable cost-sharing? Have we meaningfully expanded coverage to the uninsured? Have we reduced costs for middle-class Americans and working people?Data matters and should inform our transition. Health care is personal to people and we should make sure we get it right.These benchmarks are also key as we fight back against the lies pushed by Big Pharma and their allies that this plan would \u201cend Medicare as we know it,\u201d or other misleading attacks. Seniors will be able to keep their Medicare and have dental, vision, and hearing aids covered immediately. Medicare Advantage plans would continue uninterrupted by the transition. Under my plan, no one will lose access to insurance during a transition. Period.At the end of the ten-year transition, every American will be a part of this new Medicare system. They will get insurance either through the new public Medicare plan or a Medicare plan offered by a private insurer within that system. Seniors will see stronger Medicare benefits than they have now. We will cover millions more people who don\u2019t have health insurance today. And we will reduce costs, save our country money, and ensure that no American has to sacrifice getting the care they need just because the cost is a barrier.Right now, the U.S. spends $3.5 trillion a year on health care. If we do nothing over the next decade, that number will skyrocket to an estimated $6 trillion a year. So the real question is: how can we afford not to act?By extending the phase-in period to ten years, we will decrease the overall cost of the program compared to the Sanders proposal, and we can save additional money by accelerating delivery system reforms and value-based care that rewards meaningful outcomes. More than 200 economists have said we will dramatically save money over the long run if we expand the Medicare program to include everyone and limit profits for drug companies and insurance companies.Senator Sanders, for example, has put forward a number of ways to help pay for his Medicare for All plan, including an income-based premium paid by employers, higher taxes on the top 1%, taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income, among others. I think these are good options, especially making the top 1% and corporations pay their fair share through a more progressive income, payroll, and estate tax.However, one of Senator Sanders\u2019 options is to tax households making above $29,000 an additional 4% income-based premium. I believe this hits the middle class too hard.To pay for this specific change, I would tax Wall Street stock trades at 0.2%, bond trades at 0.1%, and derivative transactions at 0.002%. Think of it like this: that\u2019s a $2 fee on a $1,000 trade by investors and big banks. I would also end foreign tax shelters by taxing offshore corporate income at the same rate as domestic corporate income. Together, these proposals would raise well over $2 trillion over ten years, more than enough to make up the difference from raising the middle-class income threshold.In total, this plan will reduce our country\u2019s health care costs and lower Americans\u2019 out-of-pocket costs, all while extending health insurance coverage to every American.So that\u2019s my plan: stop the attacks on Americans\u2019 health care coming from this administration and their Republican and special interest allies, expand on the progress made under Obamacare, immediately offer an improved Medicare buy-in to all Americans, put in place an expanded Medicare system that everyone is in, expand coverage, reduce costs, increase options for care, and establish a reasonable phase-in period with clear benchmarks to ensure a smooth transition to Medicare for All.And what will the result be? Health insurance for every American. Expansive coverage for nearly all medical benefits. Continuity of care. Lower health care costs for American consumers and our country overall. Improved health, well-being, and productivity for the American people.Learn more about my plan at kamalaharris.org\/medicare-for-all.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/kamalaharris.medium.com\/my-plan-for-medicare-for-all-7730370dd421?source=user_profile---------30----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"One of the problems with our politics is that it often demands 60-second sound bites or slogans to answer complex questions.

Together, these proposals would raise well over $2 trillion over ten years, more than enough to make up the difference from raising the middle-class income threshold.In total, this plan will reduce our country's health care costs and lower Americans' out-of-pocket costs, all while extending health insurance coverage to every American.So that's my plan: stop the attacks on Americans' health care coming from this administration and their Republican and special interest allies, expand on the progress made under Obamacare, immediately offer an improved Medicare buy-in to all Americans, put in place an expanded Medicare system that everyone is in, expand coverage, reduce costs, increase options for care, and establish a reasonable phase-in period with clear benchmarks to ensure a smooth transition to Medicare for All.And what will the result be? Health insurance for every American. Expansive coverage for nearly all medical benefits. Continuity of care. Lower health care costs for American consumers and our country overall. Improved health, well-being, and productivity for the American people.Learn more about my plan at"}

Kamala believes in an America that is fully accessible and inclusive for everyone and her administration will fight to make this a reality across all parts of our society. As president, Kamala will have diverse leaders with disabilities developing all the policies her administration champions, including priorities that will lift up people with disabilities.To do this we must expand economic opportunity and security for people with disabilities. In 2018, the unemployment rate for workers with disabilities was more than twice that for workers without disabilities. Only 32 percent of people with disabilities who are working-age are employed. On the other hand, 73 percent of people without disabilities in the same age group are employed. Just as we fight to finally eliminate practices that lead to people with disabilities being paid subminimum wages, we also have to speak the truth about how we need to eliminate barriers that make it harder for people with disabilities to fully participate in our workforce.Under Kamala\u2019s leadership, in partnership with the disability community, we can build an America that lives up to the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Our country is stronger when everyone is valued, everyone has dignity, and everyone can be part of the competitive labor force.She\u2019ll pass the Transformation to Competitive Employment Act, which will establish a grant program for states to help redesign business models and strategies to increase employment of people with disabilities in competitive integrated employment.People with disabilities are both more likely to work in low wage fields as well as be paid less than the minimum wage. That\u2019s why she\u2019ll pass the Raise the Wage Act, which will not only raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour but will also phase out the \u201csubminimum\u201d wage.Kamala will make changes to the vocational rehabilitation system at the Department of Education, which gives grants to states to help people with disabilities prepare for, secure, and retain employment. Kamala will make sure that the grant program covers a wider range of services and supports for a greater number of people to help more people with disabilities get the workplace accommodations, adaptive technology and devices, and other things that can be barriers to finding and maintaining a job.And she\u2019ll fight to increase funding for the program so that it can serve everyone who would benefit from assistance under it.Federal civil rights laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act already require that our transportation systems and housing projects be fully accessible. However, these accommodations still have accessibility issues because efforts to make the projects fully accessible are frequently not done at the front-end of the project.For example, more than a quarter of rail stations across the country are not fully accessible to people with disabilities. The same is true of 12% of the U.S. rail fleet.Kamala will address this by taking executive action to direct the Department of Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to require that funding recipients submit plans detailing how their projects will be fully accessible prior to receiving funding.And she\u2019ll direct her education secretary to increase enforcement of civil rights laws designed to protect that right to an education.And she\u2019ll work to increase resources to better prepare teachers to meet the needs of students with disabilities in inclusive classrooms and expand access to post-secondary education for people with disabilities.She\u2019ll fight to finally ratify U.S. participation in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to affirm American leadership in fighting for the civil rights of people with disabilities around the world.She\u2019ll fight to pass the Working Families Tax Credit to allow people without dependent children to take advantage of the Earned Income Tax Credit. And she\u2019ll make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable which would be particularly beneficial to families who have children with disabilities.Kamala\u2019s plan fully covers comprehensive long-term services and supports, as well as assistive technologies and Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) services that are critical to children with disabilities. It also ensures that those long-term services and supports are consumer-directed and are provided in home- and community-based settings.And it ensures that when families move, or people with disabilities change jobs, their coverage moves with them so that they have uninterrupted access to the care and services they need.She\u2019ll ensure that people with disabilities impacted by disasters have the services and other civil rights protections they are entitled to under the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, so they can return home, to work and school at the same time as the rest of the disaster impacted community.Kamala will recommit us to the goal President Obama established in 2010 to make the federal government a model inclusive employer and strongly enforce Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. She will direct agencies to create updated plans for how to make the recruitment, hiring, and retention of people with disabilities a priority in her administration. And she\u2019ll make sure this diverse leadership is represented in senior positions and that there are opportunities for promotion.Kamala will also take executive action to ensure that the technology the federal government buys, develops, or uses is fully accessible, as is currently required by federal law. This will include requiring each agency to implement a plan to ensure that any new technology developed or acquired is fully accessible before it is deployed, as well as doing an analysis of existing technology that is not compliant and develop a timeline for updating it.And Kamala will create new senior-level positions in the White House to make sure that the priorities for people with disabilities are incorporated across all of her policymaking, particularly on the Domestic Policy Council and the economic work of her administration.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/kamalaharris.medium.com\/kamalas-commitment-to-full-inclusion-and-civil-rights-for-people-with-disabilities-7cfd8adb512?source=user_profile---------28----------------------------","Summary":"EmptySummary","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Recommitting to building inclusive economic opportunity in Americ.According to CDC data, about a quarter of people in the United States have a disability.

{"SpeechID":"MEKH99201924","POTUS":"Kamala Harris","Date":"2019-09-09","SpeechTitle":"Kamala\u2019s Plan to Transform the Criminal Justice System and Re-Envision Public Safety in America","RawText":"Click here for a PDF version of the pla.Reforming our criminal justice system is as complex and pressing an endeavor as any other in our lifetime. It is the civil rights issue of our time, and there is perhaps no one more uniquely suited to taking on this issue than Kamala Harris.From the civil rights protests she attended as a child, to her time working inside the system as a prosecutor, Kamala has seen firsthand the fundamental flaws of the system. And because of her experiences, she has the insight and the fight to fundamentally transform the system for the better.At its best, the system serves to hold serious wrongdoers accountable and achieve justice for crime survivors, while helping to build safer and healthier communities. At its worst, decades of failed policies have created an unjust, unequal, and vastly expansive system that disproportionately harms communities of color and criminalizes individuals just because they are poor. It is long past time to re-envision public safety by strengthening and supporting our communities and drastically limiting the number of people we expose to our criminal justice system. As president, Kamala will fundamentally transform how we approach public safety.The criminal justice system in America is vast. There are about 2.3 million people in the nation\u2019s prisons and jails today. Of the 2.3 million people, nearly 2 million are in state prisons and local jails. Thus, it is important to understand that much of criminal justice policy occurs on the state and local level. However, the president also has an important role to play in effecting change.As president, there are four main levers that Kamala can exercise to change criminal justice policy. She can: (1) work with Congress and use her executive authority to change law and policy on the federal level; (2) investigate state and local actors through the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division; (3) empower and incentivize behavior on the state and local level through federal funding; and (4) use her voice as president to advocate for change. And as president, Kamala will exercise every one of these levers to increase public safety, reduce our outsized criminal justice system, and make it fairer and more equitable for all.Guiding Principles:(1) End Mass Incarceration and Invest Resources into Evidence and Community-Based Programs that Reduce Crime and Help Build Safe and Healthy Communitie,(2) Law Enforcement\u2019s Primary Mission is to Serve and Protect Communities. It Should Instill Trust and Be Accountable to the Communities It Serve,(3) The System Must Treat Individuals Equitably and Humanel,(4) The System Must Protect Vulnerable Peopl,There are about 2.3 million people in the nation\u2019s prisons and jails today, which is an increase from about 500,000 in 1980. But perhaps more importantly, people go to jail 10.6 million times every year. The number of jail admissions is perhaps a more accurate reflection of just how expansive the system is, and how much work is required to transform and contract the system. Worse, Black Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of White Americans; the incarceration rate for Black women is twice that of White women. And when these men and women are released from confinement, one report found that they face nearly 50,000 federal, state, and local legal restrictions that serve as barriers to reentry into society. For example, one study shows that a criminal record can reduce the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50%, and the negative impact is even more considerable for Black applicants.End the \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d , One-fifth of the incarcerated population , or 456,000 people , is serving time for a drug charge while another 1.15 million are on probation and parole for drug-related offenses. This is especially the case on the federal level, where nearly half of the prison population are there for drug crimes. So it is past time to end the failed war on drugs, and it begins with legalizing marijuana. Marijuana arrests account for over 50% of all drug arrests. Of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010, 88% were for simple marijuana possession. Worse, despite roughly equal usage rates, Black people are about four times more likely than White people to be arrested for marijuana. Black Americans also make up nearly 30% of all drug-related arrests, despite accounting for only 12.5% of substance users.Legalizing marijuana. Support states in legalizing marijuana; legalize marijuana on the federal level, expunge convictions, and reinvest in the community.Kamala\u2019s Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act does the following: Legalizes marijuana at the federal level by removing the substance from the Controlled Substances Act. This applies retroactively to prior and pending convictions, and enables states to set their own policy; Requires expungement and, on motion, re-sentencing for marijuana-based convictions; Creates 3 grant programs by assessing a sales tax on marijuana and marijuana products. The grant programs do the following:(1) Provides services to the individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs, including job training, re-entry services, legal aid;(2) Provides states and localities with funds to make loans to assist small businesses in the marijuana industry that are owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals;(3) Provides funds for programs that minimize barriers to marijuana licensing and employment for the individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.Invest money in states to significantly reduce the incarceration of women convicted of non-violent offenses. While most are aware of the system\u2019s impact on men, it is less well known how quickly the incarcerated population for women has gone up. According to the Sentencing Project, \u201cthe female incarcerated population stands nearly eight times higher than in 1980.\u201d We must therefore focus on dramatically reducing the number of incarcerated women convicted of non-violent offenses by finding alternatives to incarceration.Sentencing Reforms. Significant reforms must be made with respect to the criminal justice system\u2019s sentencing schemes, including:End mandatory minimums on federal level and incentivize states to do the same. As a Senator, Kamala is a cosponsor of the Justice Safety Valve Act, which would eliminate all mandatory minimums by letting judges issue sentences below the mandatory minimum.Reform clemency process to form clemency\/sentencing review units and significantly increase use of clemency.The clemency process needs to be removed from the Department of Justice where there are inherent conflicts of interest. Specifically, DOJ should not determine whether individuals convicted by their own colleagues should be shortened or commuted.For those who have been sentenced to long prison terms (i.e., 20 years or more), the sentencing review unit would provide for an assessment as to whether it is appropriate and serves the interests of justice for the incarcerated individual to be released or have their sentence shortened after having served 10 years.Reform community supervision.Invest money in states to shorten the length of probation and other forms of community supervision where appropriate and where it serves the interests of justice;Invest money in states to end jail time for technical violations of community- based supervision (reforming parole).End the use of private prisons. Less than 10 percent of our prison population is held in private facilities, but it is nevertheless still necessary to end the profit motive that drives these private prisons, as it is inhumane to profit off of imprisonment and allow a system that continues to create incentives that are contrary to the goal of helping people rehabilitate themselves and return to the community. Kamala also believe we must end private detention centers for undocumented immigrants.Several studies have demonstrated that children\u2019s earliest life experiences , from nourishment and reading to poverty and exposure to violence , have profound effects on their brain development and long-term health and safety. Even later in childhood, the brain maturity of our young people is fundamentally different from adults. As a result, children must be treated differently by our government, from the child welfare and education systems to our criminal justice system. We must invest in the building blocks of public safety by prioritizing the health, well-being, and safety of children from their earliest years to set them up to thrive as adults.Create a Bureau of Children and Family Justice.As the Attorney General of California, Kamala created the Bureau of Children\u2019s Justice to focus on children\u2019s civil rights in the child welfare, education, and juvenile justice systems.As president, Kamala would build and expand on that idea by creating a Bureau of Children and Family Justice to work across agencies in supporting communities and families, including investing in healthcare, education, jobs, and other wrap around services.As president, Kamala would address the broken foster care system and disrupt the pipeline of children from the child welfare system to the criminal justice system. She\u2019ll work with leaders like Rep. Karen Bass and the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth (CCFY) to ensure foster youth have the education, healthcare, and other wraparound services they need to heal from trauma and grow into healthy, thriving adults.Research shows that access to school-based health services has a positive impact on absences, dropout rates, disciplinary problems and other academic outcomes, in addition to the crucial health-related benefits these services provide. As president, Kamala will ensure that students continue to have access to school-based health services by requiring equivalent or better services to be covered and reimbursable under her Medicare for All plan.Invest money in states\/localities to end juvenile incarceration in favor of restorative justice programs and wrap-around services, except for the most serious crimes.End life sentences of children and offer opportunities for sentence reduction to young people convicted of crimes. For example, fight to end de facto life without parole sentences by allowing youth sentenced to more than 20 years in prison for crimes committed before their 18th birthday to petition the original sentencing court for review of their sentence after they have served 10 years.End the transfer of children to adult prisons;End solitary confinement for children;Invest money in states to stop criminal charges for school-based disciplinary behavior;Invest money in states to hold schools accountable for discriminatory practices in suspensions and expulsions. As CA AG, Kamala launched an investigation into the Stockton Unified School District police department over concerns of racial discrimination in school discipline and school policing, including treatment of elementary school children. CA DOJ announced a comprehensive settlement in 2019 to resolve systemic civil rights violations of African American and Latinx students and students with disabilities.Make significant federal investment for innovative Back-on-Track programs that provide in-custody and out-of-custody education and comprehensive services to individuals convicted of crimes to reduce recidivism by equipping them with the tools they need to reenter society successfully.Education, job training, and treatment. Mandate that federal prisons provide educational and vocational training, and mental health and addiction treatment in custody, including diagnosis and treatment of trauma. Early in her career, Kamala worked with Dr. Nadine Burke Harris , now California\u2019s Surgeon General , to create the Center for Youth Wellness to screen children for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and treat the toxic stress that can have lasting effects on their physical and mental health. As president, she\u2019ll invest federal money to incentivize states to follow their lead.Reentry educational course. Mandate federal prisons to provide a reentry educational course that provides, among other things, information on acquiring identification and their options with respect to housing, education, treatment, and other assistance programs. Invest federal money into this program and incentivize states to provide the same reentry educational course.Create an advisory board of directly impacted individuals to make recommendations for successful re-entry.Expungement & Sealing, Automatic expungement and sealing of offenses that are not serious or violent after 5 year,Ban the box, i.e., remove questions about an individual\u2019s conviction histories until after conditional offers have been made. Individuals reentering society should have a meaningful opportunity to obtain a job and reintegrate into the community.Restore voting rights for all who have served their sentence.End federal bans on formerly-incarcerated individuals (as well as those arrested and not incarcerated) access to public housing, student loans, SNAP, and professional work licenses, including: Fair Chance at Housing Act of 2019: Kamala\u2019s bicameral bill introduced with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which helps remove barriers to obtaining federal housing assistance for individuals with criminal records.Prioritize enforcement of anti-discrimination laws\/EEOC rules that prevent discrimination in employment, housing, etc. based on a prior convictions.Law enforcement is a critical part of our communities and we should appreciate the sacrifices of those who serve on our behalf. And we should also recognize that the majority of those in law enforcement are dedicated public servants who serve honorably. At the same time, there are some communities , especially communities of color , who have not always held the same trust in law enforcement because of their experiences. When individuals in these communities are subject to racial profiling, excessive force, or other misconduct , they have a right to demand that police be held accountable.There are an estimated 16,000 to 18,000 local, state, and tribal law enforcement agencies in the United States with the average agency having fewer than 50 officers. In this respect, the American policing system is unique in that each of these agencies falls under the control of a local governing body, executive, or elected official(s). Local control is arguably one of the key characteristics that makes the American policing system unique. It is also the characteristic that presents the greatest challenge to establishing standardized ethical and professional practices within a system few deny is in need of reform. In order to reform the policing system, Kamala would:Support a national standard for use of deadly force to only when \u201cnecessary\u201d and when no reasonable alternatives are available. The Camden Police Department, led by Chief Scott Thomson has instituted one of the most progressive use of force policies that might serve as a model. It incorporated stakeholder feedback from various stakeholders, including the New Jersey ACLU and the Fraternal Order of Police. The policy focuses on six core principles:(1) Officers may use force only to accomplish specific law enforcement objectives.(2) Whenever feasible, officers should attempt to de-escalate confrontations with the goal of resolving encounters without force. Officers may only use force that is objectively reasonable, necessary, and as a last resort.(3) Officers must use only the amount of force that is proportionate to the circumstances.(4) Deadly force is only authorized as a last resort and only in strict accordance with this directive.(5) Officers must promptly provide or request medical aid.(6) Employees have a duty to stop and report uses of force that violate any applicable law and\/or this directive.Create a National Police Systems Review Board. As noted above there are approximately 16,000 to 18,000 police departments in the United States, which means that safety standards and regulations vary from department to department. Independent bodies such as the National Transportation Safety Board have played a role in greatly reducing airplane crashes by recommending and implementing industry standards and regulations after airplane crashes.Kamala would work with Congress to create a National Police Systems Review Board, which would collect data and review police shootings and other cases of severe misconduct, and work to issue recommendations and implement safety standards based on evidence revealed in these reviews.Independent investigations of officer-involved shootings. Kamala would allocate resources to the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP) to incentivize state agencies to conduct independent investigations of officer-involved shootings.Kamala has previously supported independent investigations as California\u2019s Attorney General, for example, when she submitted a budget proposal to the Governor that would fund 3 California Department of Justice teams to investigate officer-involved shootings statewide.Increase resources for U.S. Department of Justice pattern and practice investigations and restore the use of consent decrees.Double the size of Civil Rights Division.Pass legislation that authorizes the Civil Rights Division to have subpoena power for their pattern and practice investigations. As CA AG, Kamala supported California Department of Justice pattern and practice investigations. Specifically, she opened civil pattern and practice investigations into the Bakersfield Police Department and Kern County Sheriff\u2019s Office in response to community complaints and reports of excessive use of force and misconduct.Restore the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office\u2019s ability to conduct voluntary organizational assessments of law enforcement agencies and provide recommendations and technical assistance to address deficient operational systems and problematic practices.Increase funding for body cameras and set standards for its use; Standards must take into account privacy concerns and community input.Invest federal resources to incentivize states to hire a diverse and qualified workforce;Invest federal money and create accountability mechanisms to incentivize state\/local governments to provide police use of force training that includes: De-escalation; Crisis Intervention; Mental Health; Proportionality; Deadly force investigations; Providing medical treatment; Giving oral warnings when feasible; Psychological roots of bias; Procedural justice.Reform civil asset forfeiture laws to eliminate abuses such that it is only limited to cripple transnational gangs and major criminal enterprises , and not to profit and fund police departments.De-militarize police departments. Kamala would reinstate President Obama\u2019s executive order, which prohibited sales of certain military equipment and placed reasonable access restraints and training requirements to ensure law enforcement had access to tools it needed without militarizing local police.Address racial disparities in technology used by law enforcement. Kamala would work with stakeholders, including civil rights groups, technology groups, and law enforcement, to institute regulations and protections to ensure that technology used by federal law enforcement , such as facial recognition and other surveillance , does not further racial disparities or other biases. She would also invest federal money to incentivize states and localities to do the same.Law Enforcement Transparency & Accountability via Data Collection and Analysis. As Attorney General, Kamala launched a first-of-its-kind open data platform called OpenJustice, which created an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability with the public about law enforcement activities in California. She would similarly do so on the federal level by:Require states receiving federal law enforcement funds to participate in the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training (IADLEST) National Decertification Index (NDI).In the U.S., 46 states provide for revoking a police officer\u2019s license or certificate when the officer has engaged in serious misconduct. This is the case in other professions as well, such as law and medicine. The IADLEST\u2019s national registry provides information related to officer misconduct as reported by participating state government agencies. This list should be comprehensive and include all states. This would prohibit officers who committed serious misconduct from simply applying for law enforcement jobs in other states.Expand access to mental health services and trauma-informed care. In the United States, about 44 million adults are believed to experience a mental health condition in any given year. But over 20% of that group , 9 million American adults , report having an unmet need. And, according to some estimates, 56% of state prisoners and 64% of jail inmates have or have had mental health issues.Prioritize mental health informed responses. Because mental health care is profoundly under-resourced in America, the criminal justice system is nearly always the frontline response for individuals with mental health disorders, a reality that frequently results in officer use of deadly force. According to a 2015 report, a person with an untreated mental illness is 16 times more likely to be killed by a law enforcement officer than others who encounter law enforcement. A review by the Washington Post revealed that over 20% of individuals killed by a law enforcement officer in 2018 was experiencing a mental or emotional health crisis.Support proposals that de-emphasize criminal justice interventions in response to mental health issues because, until we have successfully strengthened our mental health care system, the criminal justice system will continue to be tasked with frontline interactions with people whose primary need is mental health care. Increase funding for U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs grants to improve law enforcement-based responses to people with mental health issues, including training to verbally de-escalate encounters without resorting to physical force.Increase federal funding for the hiring of mental health professionals to accompany police officers in responding to calls involving individuals in mental crises.Increase federal grants that support mental health first aid programming that trains participants , teachers, community and city officials of all work functions, and city and community residents , in the critical steps for crisis intervention so that bystanders have the tools to help prevent deaths, assess harmful situations, and seek appropriate medical treatment. The goal is to make mental health first aid as common as regular first aid, such as CPR, which will reduce the need for criminal justice interventions in response to mental health issues.Increase funding for officer safety and wellness. As noted by the Department of Justice, the occupational fatality rate for law enforcement is three to five times greater than the national average for the working population. Career dangerousness is compounded by exposure to the same traumatic environments that plague our most vulnerable communities. If our goal is healthy communities, the people sworn to protect them must also be healthy. It is therefore important to ensure that there is sufficient funding to address the physical and mental health, along with safety, of officers.Provide explicit authority to the U.S Department of Justice to conduct pattern and practice investigations of prosecutorial offices that commit systematic misconduct.Invest federal funds in data collection and data analysis for greater transparency and accountability.Require federal prosecutors to provide data on their charging, plea bargaining, and sentencing decisions.Provide funding to incentivize state prosecutors to participate in a national reporting program.Invest federal funds to assess prosecutorial priorities. The FBI invests millions of dollars into developing a threat assessment system that helps them set priorities. The same should be done with prosecutors so that they prioritize cases that do the most to promote public safety and justice.Support for public defenders to instill greater trust and equity in the justice system. Kamala believes we must support our public defender systems, which are straining to uphold the constitutional right to counsel for indigent defendants as required by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Gideon v. Wainwright decision. Her EQUAL Defense Act would create a $250 million grant program to fund public defenders. To receive grants, states and localities must impose workload limits, achieve pay parity between public defenders and prosecutors within 5 years, and collect data on public defender workloads. Increases funding for public defender training. Increases student loan repayment program. Her legislation has been endorsed by Jon Rapping of Gideon\u2019s Promise.End money bail. Our bail system is unjust and broken. 450,000 Americans sit in jail today awaiting trial because they cannot afford to pay bail. Excessive cash bail disproportionately harms people from low-income communities and communities of color. Black defendants are more likely to be detained before trial and less likely to be able to post bail compared with similarly-situated White defendants. And Black men pay higher bail than similarly-situated White defendants. Kamala\u2019s Pretrial Integrity and Safety Act with Senator Rand Paul was her first major bipartisan bill in the Senate. The bill provides grants to incentivize states to significantly reform their money bail systems to make them more just.End the use of fines and fees that criminalize the poor. Invest money in states to end the fines and fees system otherwise known as LFOs (Legal Financial Obligations), where individuals are incarcerated based on the inability to pay fines and fees. In addition, we need to eliminate court fees and fees associated with diversion, treatment, or community supervision that make it harder for individuals to reintegrate into society.End suspension of driver\u2019s licenses for unpaid fines. Invest money in states to stop suspending driver\u2019s licenses of those who cannot pay off their tickets or fines.Currently, more than 40 states use driver\u2019s license suspension as punishment for failure to pay debts, include traffic or parking tickets, civil judgments from court, child support orders, and other debt. This is counterproductive and harmful to individuals who need to commute to their jobs, take their children to school, and otherwise support their family.Humane Treatment of PrisonersEnd the death penalty. Kamala believes the death penalty is immoral, discriminatory, ineffective, and a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars. As San Francisco District Attorney, Kamala declined to seek the death penalty in the prosecution of an individual accused of killing a police officer, despite facing relentless political pressure to do so.End solitary confinement. End solitary confinement, but ensure alternative therapeutic and rehabilitative mechanisms are available to protect the safety of individuals in prisons and of prison staff.End the profiting off of incarceration. Specifically, prohibit prisons from making a profit from charging exorbitant rates for prisoners for telecommunications and commissary\/food and supplies in prison.Keeping Families Intact. Ripping families apart creates lasting harm and undermines the goal of building safer and healthier communities. We should strive to maintain family connections.Make it easier for family to visit prisoner,Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act, which Kamala cosponsors would:Clear nationwide rape kit backlog in first term. Invest $1 billion to allow states to fully eliminate their rape-kit backlogs within four years and implement reforms to ensure a backlog does not happen again.As Attorney General, Kamala eliminated a longstanding backlog of DNA analysis and more than 1,000 untested rape kits in state-run labs and introduced new technology to dramatically increase the speed with which cases are analyzed.Kamala also backed California legislation in 2016 \u201cto illuminate the state\u2019s invisible backlog of untested rape kits,\u201d and in the U.S. Senate, she sponsors The Survivors\u2019 Access to Supportive Care Act, which would make rape kits more readily available at hospitals nationwide.Protecting consumers against fraud and fighting for victims\u2019 rights. Prioritize and double resources in DOJ to address corporate crimes and those who defraud consumers. For too long, corporate bad actors have escaped accountability because the justice system has not prioritized their wrongdoings. Just as Kamala did as AG, she will fight to protect consumers from fraud and for victims\u2019 rights.Big banks. Kamala secured $20 billion for California homeowners from the big banks for abusing the mortgage system and fueling the national foreclosure crisis.For-profit colleges. Kamala won a $1.1 billion judgment against the for-profit (and now defunct) Corinthian Colleges for their predatory and unlawful practices to defraud students.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/kamalaharris.medium.com\/kamalas-plan-to-transform-the-criminal-justice-system-and-re-envision-public-safety-in-america-f83a3d739bae?source=user_profile---------25----------------------------","Summary":"A plan to fundamentally transform our criminal justice system to shift away from mass incarceration and to invest in building safer and healthier communities.","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Click here for a PDF version of the pla.Reforming our criminal justice system is as complex and pressing an endeavor as any other in our lifetime. It is the civil rights issue of our time, and there is perhaps no one more uniquely suited to taking on this issue than Kamala Harris.From the civil rights protests she attended as a child, to her time working inside the system as a prosecutor, Kamala has seen firsthand the fundamental flaws of the system. And because of her experiences, she has the insight and the fight to fundamentally transform the system for the better.At its best, the system serves to hold serious wrongdoers accountable and achieve justice for crime survivors, while helping to build safer and healthier communities. At its worst, decades of failed policies have created an unjust, unequal, and vastly expansive system that disproportionately harms communities of color and criminalizes individuals just because they are poor. It is long past time to re-envision public safety by strengthening and supporting our communities and drastically limiting the number of people we expose to our criminal justice system. As president, Kamala will fundamentally transform how we approach public safety.The criminal justice system in America is vast. There are about 2.3 million people in the nation's prisons and jails today. Of the 2.3 million people, nearly 2 million are in state prisons and local jails. Thus, it is important to understand that much of criminal justice policy occurs on the state and local level. However, the president also has an important role to play in effecting change.As president, there are four main levers that Kamala can exercise to change criminal justice policy. She can: (1) work with Congress and use her executive authority to change law and policy on the federal level; (2) investigate state and local actors through the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division; (3) empower and incentivize behavior on the state and local level through federal funding; and (4) use her voice as president to advocate for change. And as president, Kamala will exercise every one of these levers to increase public safety, reduce our outsized criminal justice system, and make it fairer and more equitable for all.Guiding Principles:(1) End Mass Incarceration and Invest Resources into Evidence and Community-Based Programs that Reduce Crime and Help Build Safe and Healthy Communitie,(2) Law Enforcement's Primary Mission is to Serve and Protect Communities. It Should Instill Trust and Be Accountable to the Communities It Serve,(3) The System Must Treat Individuals Equitably and Humanel,(4) The System Must Protect Vulnerable Peopl,There are about 2.3 million people in the nation's prisons and jails today, which is an increase from about 500,000 in 1980. But perhaps more importantly, people go to jail 10.6 million times every year. The number of jail admissions is perhaps a more accurate reflection of just how expansive the system is, and how much work is required to transform and contract the system. Worse, Black Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of White Americans; the incarceration rate for Black women is twice that of White women. And when these men and women are released from confinement, one report found that they face nearly 50,000 federal, state, and local legal restrictions that serve as barriers to reentry into society. For example, one study shows that a criminal record can reduce the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50%, and the negative impact is even more considerable for Black applicants.End the 'War on Drugs' , One-fifth of the incarcerated population , or 456,000 people , is serving time for a drug charge while another 1.15 million are on probation and parole for drug-related offenses. This is especially the case on the federal level, where nearly half of the prison population are there for drug crimes. So it is past time to end the failed war on drugs, and it begins with legalizing marijuana. Marijuana arrests account for over 50% of all drug arrests. Of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010, 88% were for simple marijuana possession. Worse, despite roughly equal usage rates, Black people are about four times more likely than White people to be arrested for marijuana. Black Americans also make up nearly 30% of all drug-related arrests, despite accounting for only 12.5% of substance users.Legalizing marijuana. Support states in legalizing marijuana; legalize marijuana on the federal level, expunge convictions, and reinvest in the community.Kamala's Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act does the following: Legalizes marijuana at the federal level by removing the substance from the Controlled Substances Act. This applies retroactively to prior and pending convictions, and enables states to set their own policy; Requires expungement and, on motion, re-sentencing for marijuana-based convictions; Creates 3 grant programs by assessing a sales tax on marijuana and marijuana products. The grant programs do the following:(1) Provides services to the individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs, including job training, re-entry services, legal aid;(2) Provides states and localities with funds to make loans to assist small businesses in the marijuana industry that are owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals;(3) Provides funds for programs that minimize barriers to marijuana licensing and employment for the individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.Invest money in states to significantly reduce the incarceration of women convicted of non-violent offenses. While most are aware of the system's impact on men, it is less well known how quickly the incarcerated population for women has gone up. According to the Sentencing Project, 'the female incarcerated population stands nearly eight times higher than in 1980.' We must therefore focus on dramatically reducing the number of incarcerated women convicted of non-violent offenses by finding alternatives to incarceration.Sentencing Reforms. Significant reforms must be made with respect to the criminal justice system's sentencing schemes, including:End mandatory minimums on federal level and incentivize states to do the same. As a Senator, Kamala is a cosponsor of the Justice Safety Valve Act, which would eliminate all mandatory minimums by letting judges issue sentences below the mandatory minimum.Reform clemency process to form clemency\/sentencing review units and significantly increase use of clemency.The clemency process needs to be removed from the Department of Justice where there are inherent conflicts of interest. Specifically, DOJ should not determine whether individuals convicted by their own colleagues should be shortened or commuted.For those who have been sentenced to long prison terms (i.e., 20 years or more), the sentencing review unit would provide for an assessment as to whether it is appropriate and serves the interests of justice for the incarcerated individual to be released or have their sentence shortened after having served 10 years.Reform community supervision.Invest money in states to shorten the length of probation and other forms of community supervision where appropriate and where it serves the interests of justice;Invest money in states to end jail time for technical violations of community- based supervision (reforming parole).End the use of private prisons. Less than 10 percent of our prison population is held in private facilities, but it is nevertheless still necessary to end the profit motive that drives these private prisons, as it is inhumane to profit off of imprisonment and allow a system that continues to create incentives that are contrary to the goal of helping people rehabilitate themselves and return to the community. Kamala also believe we must end private detention centers for undocumented immigrants.Several studies have demonstrated that children's earliest life experiences , from nourishment and reading to poverty and exposure to violence , have profound effects on their brain development and long-term health and safety. Even later in childhood, the brain maturity of our young people is fundamentally different from adults. As a result, children must be treated differently by our government, from the child welfare and education systems to our criminal justice system. We must invest in the building blocks of public safety by prioritizing the health, well-being, and safety of children from their earliest years to set them up to thrive as adults.Create a Bureau of Children and Family Justice.As the Attorney General of California, Kamala created the Bureau of Children's Justice to focus on children's civil rights in the child welfare, education, and juvenile justice systems.As president, Kamala would build and expand on that idea by creating a Bureau of Children and Family Justice to work across agencies in supporting communities and families, including investing in healthcare, education, jobs, and other wrap around services.As president, Kamala would address the broken foster care system and disrupt the pipeline of children from the child welfare system to the criminal justice system. She'll work with leaders like Rep. Karen Bass and the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth (CCFY) to ensure foster youth have the education, healthcare, and other wraparound services they need to heal from trauma and grow into healthy, thriving adults.Research shows that access to school-based health services has a positive impact on absences, dropout rates, disciplinary problems and other academic outcomes, in addition to the crucial health-related benefits these services provide. As president, Kamala will ensure that students continue to have access to school-based health services by requiring equivalent or better services to be covered and reimbursable under her Medicare for All plan.Invest money in states\/localities to end juvenile incarceration in favor of restorative justice programs and wrap-around services, except for the most serious crimes.End life sentences of children and offer opportunities for sentence reduction to young people convicted of crimes. For example, fight to end de facto life without parole sentences by allowing youth sentenced to more than 20 years in prison for crimes committed before their 18th birthday to petition the original sentencing court for review of their sentence after they have served 10 years.End the transfer of children to adult prisons;End solitary confinement for children;Invest money in states to stop criminal charges for school-based disciplinary behavior;Invest money in states to hold schools accountable for discriminatory practices in suspensions and expulsions. As CA AG, Kamala launched an investigation into the Stockton Unified School District police department over concerns of racial discrimination in school discipline and school policing, including treatment of elementary school children. CA DOJ announced a comprehensive settlement in 2019 to resolve systemic civil rights violations of African American and Latinx students and students with disabilities.Make significant federal investment for innovative Back-on-Track programs that provide in-custody and out-of-custody education and comprehensive services to individuals convicted of crimes to reduce recidivism by equipping them with the tools they need to reenter society successfully.Education, job training, and treatment. Mandate that federal prisons provide educational and vocational training, and mental health and addiction treatment in custody, including diagnosis and treatment of trauma. Early in her career, Kamala worked with Dr. Nadine Burke Harris , now California's Surgeon General , to create the Center for Youth Wellness to screen children for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and treat the toxic stress that can have lasting effects on their physical and mental health. As president, she'll invest federal money to incentivize states to follow their lead.Reentry educational course. Mandate federal prisons to provide a reentry educational course that provides, among other things, information on acquiring identification and their options with respect to housing, education, treatment, and other assistance programs. Invest federal money into this program and incentivize states to provide the same reentry educational course.Create an advisory board of directly impacted individuals to make recommendations for successful re-entry.Expungement & Sealing, Automatic expungement and sealing of offenses that are not serious or violent after 5 year,Ban the box, i.e., remove questions about an individual's conviction histories until after conditional offers have been made. Individuals reentering society should have a meaningful opportunity to obtain a job and reintegrate into the community.Restore voting rights for all who have served their sentence.End federal bans on formerly-incarcerated individuals (as well as those arrested and not incarcerated) access to public housing, student loans, SNAP, and professional work licenses, including: Fair Chance at Housing Act of 2019: Kamala's bicameral bill introduced with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which helps remove barriers to obtaining federal housing assistance for individuals with criminal records.Prioritize enforcement of anti-discrimination laws\/EEOC rules that prevent discrimination in employment, housing, etc. based on a prior convictions.Law enforcement is a critical part of our communities and we should appreciate the sacrifices of those who serve on our behalf. And we should also recognize that the majority of those in law enforcement are dedicated public servants who serve honorably. At the same time, there are some communities , especially communities of color , who have not always held the same trust in law enforcement because of their experiences. When individuals in these communities are subject to racial profiling, excessive force, or other misconduct , they have a right to demand that police be held accountable.There are an estimated 16,000 to 18,000 local, state, and tribal law enforcement agencies in the United States with the average agency having fewer than 50 officers. In this respect, the American policing system is unique in that each of these agencies falls under the control of a local governing body, executive, or elected official(s). Local control is arguably one of the key characteristics that makes the American policing system unique. It is also the characteristic that presents the greatest challenge to establishing standardized ethical and professional practices within a system few deny is in need of reform. In order to reform the policing system, Kamala would:Support a national standard for use of deadly force to only when 'necessary' and when no reasonable alternatives are available. The Camden Police Department, led by Chief Scott Thomson has instituted one of the most progressive use of force policies that might serve as a model. It incorporated stakeholder feedback from various stakeholders, including the New Jersey ACLU and the Fraternal Order of Police. The policy focuses on six core principles:(1) Officers may use force only to accomplish specific law enforcement objectives.(2) Whenever feasible, officers should attempt to de-escalate confrontations with the goal of resolving encounters without force. Officers may only use force that is objectively reasonable, necessary, and as a last resort.(3) Officers must use only the amount of force that is proportionate to the circumstances.(4) Deadly force is only authorized as a last resort and only in strict accordance with this directive.(5) Officers must promptly provide or request medical aid.(6) Employees have a duty to stop and report uses of force that violate any applicable law and\/or this directive.Create a National Police Systems Review Board. As noted above there are approximately 16,000 to 18,000 police departments in the United States, which means that safety standards and regulations vary from department to department. Independent bodies such as the National Transportation Safety Board have played a role in greatly reducing airplane crashes by recommending and implementing industry standards and regulations after airplane crashes.Kamala would work with Congress to create a National Police Systems Review Board, which would collect data and review police shootings and other cases of severe misconduct, and work to issue recommendations and implement safety standards based on evidence revealed in these reviews.Independent investigations of officer-involved shootings. Kamala would allocate resources to the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP) to incentivize state agencies to conduct independent investigations of officer-involved shootings.Kamala has previously supported independent investigations as California's Attorney General, for example, when she submitted a budget proposal to the Governor that would fund 3 California Department of Justice teams to investigate officer-involved shootings statewide.Increase resources for U.S. Department of Justice pattern and practice investigations and restore the use of consent decrees.Double the size of Civil Rights Division.Pass legislation that authorizes the Civil Rights Division to have subpoena power for their pattern and practice investigations. As CA AG, Kamala supported California Department of Justice pattern and practice investigations. Specifically, she opened civil pattern and practice investigations into the Bakersfield Police Department and Kern County Sheriff's Office in response to community complaints and reports of excessive use of force and misconduct.Restore the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office's ability to conduct voluntary organizational assessments of law enforcement agencies and provide recommendations and technical assistance to address deficient operational systems and problematic practices.Increase funding for body cameras and set standards for its use; Standards must take into account privacy concerns and community input.Invest federal resources to incentivize states to hire a diverse and qualified workforce;Invest federal money and create accountability mechanisms to incentivize state\/local governments to provide police use of force training that includes: De-escalation; Crisis Intervention; Mental Health; Proportionality; Deadly force investigations; Providing medical treatment; Giving oral warnings when feasible; Psychological roots of bias; Procedural justice.Reform civil asset forfeiture laws to eliminate abuses such that it is only limited to cripple transnational gangs and major criminal enterprises , and not to profit and fund police departments.De-militarize police departments. Kamala would reinstate President Obama's executive order, which prohibited sales of certain military equipment and placed reasonable access restraints and training requirements to ensure law enforcement had access to tools it needed without militarizing local police.Address racial disparities in technology used by law enforcement. Kamala would work with stakeholders, including civil rights groups, technology groups, and law enforcement, to institute regulations and protections to ensure that technology used by federal law enforcement , such as facial recognition and other surveillance , does not further racial disparities or other biases. She would also invest federal money to incentivize states and localities to do the same.Law Enforcement Transparency & Accountability via Data Collection and Analysis. As Attorney General, Kamala launched a first-of-its-kind open data platform called OpenJustice, which created an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability with the public about law enforcement activities in California. She would similarly do so on the federal level by:Require states receiving federal law enforcement funds to participate in the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training (IADLEST) National Decertification Index (NDI).In the U.S., 46 states provide for revoking a police officer's license or certificate when the officer has engaged in serious misconduct. This is the case in other professions as well, such as law and medicine. The IADLEST's national registry provides information related to officer misconduct as reported by participating state government agencies. This list should be comprehensive and include all states. This would prohibit officers who committed serious misconduct from simply applying for law enforcement jobs in other states.Expand access to mental health services and trauma-informed care. In the United States, about 44 million adults are believed to experience a mental health condition in any given year. But over 20% of that group , 9 million American adults , report having an unmet need.

Because mental health care is profoundly under-resourced in America, the criminal justice system is nearly always the frontline response for individuals with mental health disorders, a reality that frequently results in officer use of deadly force. According to a 2015 report, a person with an untreated mental illness is 16 times more likely to be killed by a law enforcement officer than others who encounter law enforcement. A review by the Washington Post revealed that over 20% of individuals killed by a law enforcement officer in 2018 was experiencing a mental or emotional health crisis.Support proposals that de-emphasize criminal justice interventions in response to mental health issues because, until we have successfully strengthened our mental health care system, the criminal justice system will continue to be tasked with frontline interactions with people whose primary need is mental health care. Increase funding for U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs grants to improve law enforcement-based responses to people with mental health issues, including training to verbally de-escalate encounters without resorting to physical force.Increase federal funding for the hiring of mental health professionals to accompany police officers in responding to calls involving individuals in mental crises.Increase federal grants that support mental health first aid programming that trains participants , teachers, community and city officials of all work functions, and city and community residents , in the critical steps for crisis intervention so that bystanders have the tools to help prevent deaths, assess harmful situations, and seek appropriate medical treatment. The goal is to make mental health first aid as common as regular first aid, such as CPR, which will reduce the need for criminal justice interventions in response to mental health issues.Increase funding for officer safety and wellness. As noted by the Department of Justice, the occupational fatality rate for law enforcement is three to five times greater than the national average for the working population. Career dangerousness is compounded by exposure to the same traumatic environments that plague our most vulnerable communities. If our goal is healthy communities, the people sworn to protect them must also be healthy. It is therefore important to ensure that there is sufficient funding to address the physical and mental health, along with safety, of officers.Provide explicit authority to the U.S Department of Justice to conduct pattern and practice investigations of prosecutorial offices that commit systematic misconduct.Invest federal funds in data collection and data analysis for greater transparency and accountability.Require federal prosecutors to provide data on their charging, plea bargaining, and sentencing decisions.Provide funding to incentivize state prosecutors to participate in a national reporting program.Invest federal funds to assess prosecutorial priorities. The FBI invests millions of dollars into developing a threat assessment system that helps them set priorities. The same should be done with prosecutors so that they prioritize cases that do the most to promote public safety and justice.Support for public defenders to instill greater trust and equity in the justice system.

End solitary confinement, but ensure alternative therapeutic and rehabilitative mechanisms are available to protect the safety of individuals in prisons and of prison staff.End the profiting off of incarceration. Specifically, prohibit prisons from making a profit from charging exorbitant rates for prisoners for telecommunications and commissary\/food and supplies in prison.Keeping Families Intact. Ripping families apart creates lasting harm and undermines the goal of building safer and healthier communities. We should strive to maintain family connections.Make it easier for family to visit prisoner,Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act, which Kamala cosponsors would:Clear nationwide rape kit backlog in first term. Invest $1 billion to allow states to fully eliminate their rape-kit backlogs within four years and implement reforms to ensure a backlog does not happen again.As Attorney General, Kamala eliminated a longstanding backlog of DNA analysis and more than 1,000 untested rape kits in state-run labs and introduced new technology to dramatically increase the speed with which cases are analyzed.Kamala also backed California legislation in 2016 'to illuminate the state's invisible backlog of untested rape kits,' and in the U.S. Senate, she sponsors The Survivors' Access to Supportive Care Act, which would make rape kits more readily available at hospitals nationwide.Protecting consumers against fraud and fighting for victims' rights. Prioritize and double resources in DOJ to address corporate crimes and those who defraud consumers. For too long, corporate bad actors have escaped accountability because the justice system has not prioritized their wrongdoings. Just as Kamala did as AG, she will fight to protect consumers from fraud and for victims' rights.Big banks. Kamala secured $20 billion for California homeowners from the big banks for abusing the mortgage system and fueling the national foreclosure crisis.For-profit colleges. Kamala won a $1.1 billion judgment against the for-profit (and now defunct) Corinthian Colleges for their predatory and unlawful practices to defraud students."}
{"SpeechID":"MEKH199201923","POTUS":"Kamala Harris","Date":"2019-09-19","SpeechTitle":"The Path Ahead","RawText":"As we enter the fourth quarter of 2019, I wanted to provide an update on the state of our campaign and lay out some of our thinking about the path ahead. We are excited about the next four and a half months, as Kamala prepares to hit the trail hard and lay out why she\u2019s the best candidate in this race to prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump and build a broad coalition to win and unite this country.This summer has been an important period on two key fronts: building our campaign infrastructure, and raising the resources necessary to kick that infrastructure into gear in the home stretch of this primary.Kamala has consistently been the candidate voters want to know more about and hear from more. There is so much interest in her historic candidacy, and when voters get to know her better, they really like her. Her favorability is strong and durable, and she\u2019s well-regarded across a broad demographic coalition. She\u2019s been rock solid in the top five in this historically large and sprawling field from the very beginning, and is well-positioned to break through and win the Democratic nomination.When it comes to public polls, it\u2019s important to remember where we are. In October 2003, John Kerry, who went on to win the Democratic nomination, was polling in fifth place, at around 8 percent. At this point in 2007, Barack Obama trailed both Hillary Clinton and John Edwards consistently in Iowa caucus polls , and Clinton led national polls by an average of 18 points. (She led the national polls by double digits until the week after Iowa!) In 2015, Clinton led Bernie Sanders by 21 points in Iowa. She ended up only winning by less than half of 1 percent.I say all that not to make any excuses. But there have been about 25 Democratic primary horse race polls in the past 30 days, and they go up and down. Even the NBC\/WSJ poll this week revealed that only 9 percent of respondents say they\u2019ve made up their mind in this race. The media is going to keep feverishly covering these polls, but we can\u2019t get too high or too low. We are focused on executing our plan and winning this election.This month is going to be important because it is really when we start to see the fruits of what we have been preparing for since the beginning of this race. October is when voters begin to really decide who they want to support in this primary, and we are hitting the gas.Following the five-day Iowa bus tour in August that took her 650 miles for 18 events in 11 counties, Kamala will double down on Iowa, campaigning there each week in October. We will add over 60 more organizers in state and open 10 more offices. This is an extension of the marker we laid down there this summer, when we grew our staff to 65 people and began work in 7 offices including our headquarters in Des Moines.Kamala has a unique message and appeal to caucus-goers who have so often defied conventional wisdom and expectations in the previous two cycles. We are under no illusions: we are asking Democratic voters and caucus-goers to do something that\u2019s never been done before, to support a nominee that does not look like any nominee before now. That will take effort, energy, and resources up until caucus day. But this campaign is up for it, and Kamala Harris is up for it.As someone who has lived and worked in California, I have seen Kamala\u2019s electoral history up close and personal. Whether it was taking on the machine and running for district attorney or polling at 6% in polls when she ran for Attorney General, she has always proven she could build a broad coalition to win. A lot of people in that state have bet against Kamala Harris and lost.Voters are still very much trying to decide who the best Democrat to beat Donald Trump is, and we feel strongly that Kamala will convince them it\u2019s her over the next few months.She is going to make the case that we will not defeat Trump , especially in the critical states we must win to hit 270 electoral votes , by going backwards or longing for a bygone era with nostalgia, saying that we just need to go back to a \u201cnormal\u201d that, frankly, was not working for millions of people. Trump was not elected because this country was working great for everyone.We also won\u2019t get there by jumping headfirst into endless ideological fights that may further divide Americans at a time when so many people desperately want to bring the country together after three years of relentless division.Kamala is going to argue that we win by uniting this country around the common issues we\u2019re all facing , regardless of demography or geography. She believes that Trump\u2019s constant division is preventing us from getting anything done, and focusing on the \u201c3AM issues\u201d she has talked so much about, like concrete actions to stop gun violence and a sensible plan to give working and middle-class people $500 a month to make ends meet, is critical to defeating him and allowing us to write a new chapter where we actually achieve solutions to the problems we face.And she will continue to focus on pursuing justice , whether it\u2019s against a lawless president, or companies who break the law and pollute our environment, or for women and people of color whose rights are being trampled by forces seeking to put them down.That\u2019s what Kamala is going to focus on as we criss-cross Iowa and show voters why she is the best person to prosecute the case against four more years of Trump , and win.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/kamalaharris.medium.com\/the-path-ahead-96d5269b0097?source=user_profile---------24----------------------------","Summary":"Memo from Juan Rodriguez, Campaign Manager","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"As we enter the fourth quarter of 2019, I wanted to provide an update on the state of our campaign and lay out some of our thinking about the path ahead.

To win, we are going to have to fight against those who have been trying to push hate and division among us and have Americans turn on each other.To win, we\u2019re going to have to fight for what I know in my heart and in my soul to be true , which is in the beauty and diversity of who we are as a nation, we all have so much more in common than what separates us.And to win, we are going to need a nominee on that stage with Donald Trump who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump , and Iowa, you are looking at her.In fact the first time I walked into a courtroom, I spoke five words. \u2018Kamala Harris, For the People.\u2019And those words, \u2018For the People,\u2019 capture our system of justice. Because there are two points when we say for the people. One, in our system of justice, we have rightly said that a harm against anyone is a harm against everyone , that no one should ever be made to fight alone. And for the people, when I stood there, and when I stand here today, also means all the people. Regardless of race, regardless of gender, regardless of sexual orientation, regardless of the party with which they are registered to vote, regardless of the language your grandmother speaks.

For the People.When I was the Attorney General of California, running the second largest Department of Justice only to the United States Department of Justice, it meant taking on the biggest banks in the United States, who had engaged in predatory lending practices, and bringing back to the homeowners of my state $20 billion.And I will say that, in the name of the people, I believe that in 2020 justice is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot when, in America, there is a father who is holding down two jobs, trying to figure out how to get through the end of the month , and paying more taxes than the richest 400 families in America.

They are afraid they will be a gunman roaming the hallways of their school.

{"SpeechID":"MEKH1912201919","POTUS":"Kamala Harris","Date":"2019-12-19","SpeechTitle":"Impeachment","RawText":"It\u2019s been a few weeks since we made the heartbreaking decision to suspend our campaign for president. Since then, Donald Trump has sought to continue to flout the Constitution and the rule of law.I wanted to reach out to you with a note about what will happen when the impeachment trial comes to the Senate, and our solemn duty to seek justice against this corrupt president and administration.Last night, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Donald Trump. Sometime early in the new year, I will take an oath on the Senate floor to uphold the Constitution, review evidence, and follow the facts wherever they lead , regardless of party or ideology.As a former prosecutor, I understand the importance of holding powerful people accountable. I know that every trial requires fairness and truth. Any trial that abandons the pursuit of truth cannot be considered fair or just.But Mitch McConnell appears more interested in covering up the president\u2019s misconduct than in pursuing truth and fairness. He\u2019s already trying to limit the impeachment trial by preventing witnesses from testifying, and he has all but announced a verdict. In doing so, he showed the American people that he has no intention of honoring his oath.Let\u2019s be clear: Mitch McConnell doesn\u2019t want a Senate trial. He wants a Senate cover-up.Fortunately, McConnell does not have the power to unilaterally undermine this trial. Every single senator will be empowered with an equal vote on how the trial will proceed.In this trial, senators will be far more than jurors. Each of us will vote to determine the rules for the trial, decide which witnesses testify, and ultimately serve as both court and jury.Each of us will be called on to uphold our oath with every decision we make.

Since then, Donald Trump has sought to continue to flout the Constitution and the rule of law.I wanted to reach out to you with a note about what will happen when the impeachment trial comes to the Senate, and our solemn duty to seek justice against this corrupt president and administration.Last night, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Donald Trump. Sometime early in the new year, I will take an oath on the Senate floor to uphold the Constitution, review evidence, and follow the facts wherever they lead , regardless of party or ideology.As a former prosecutor, I understand the importance of holding powerful people accountable. I know that every trial requires fairness and truth. Any trial that abandons the pursuit of truth cannot be considered fair or just.But Mitch McConnell appears more interested in covering up the president's misconduct than in pursuing truth and fairness. He's already trying to limit the impeachment trial by preventing witnesses from testifying, and he has all but announced a verdict. In doing so, he showed the American people that he has no intention of honoring his oath.Let's be clear: Mitch McConnell doesn't want a Senate trial. He wants a Senate cover-up.Fortunately, McConnell does not have the power to unilaterally undermine this trial. Every single senator will be empowered with an equal vote on how the trial will proceed.In this trial, senators will be far more than jurors. Each of us will vote to determine the rules for the trial, decide which witnesses testify, and ultimately serve as both court and jury.Each of us will be called on to uphold our oath with every decision we make. And we will all be held accountable by the American people if we refuse to discover the facts relevant to the articles of impeachment.Senator Schumer has made a reasonable request to hear from additional witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the president's misconduct.We need to hear from Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who admitted to Mr. Trump's bribery scheme on live television.We need to hear from the former national security adviser, John Bolton, who has been shopping stories about Trump to book publishers instead of speaking with Congress.Even Richard Nixon allowed the key figures behind the Watergate scandal to speak to Congress, and he eventually turned over incriminating portions of his Oval Office recordings to investigators.But Trump has stonewalled Congress and inhibited our ability to seek justice by demanding that those closest to the center of the Ukraine scandal stay silent.The Senate should not vote on any article of impeachment or consider a motion to dismiss the trial until we have reviewed the additional testimony and evidence that we have requested.I have never been in a courtroom where the accused can unilaterally block witnesses from testifying or prohibit prosecutors from asking witnesses questions.

{"SpeechID":"MEKH208202012","POTUS":"Kamala Harris","Date":"2020-08-20","SpeechTitle":"Kamala Harris Accepts Vice-Presidential Nomination","RawText":"Greetings America.It is truly an honor to be speaking with you.That I am here tonight is a testament to the dedication of generations before me. Women and men who believed so fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all.This week marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment. And we celebrate the women who fought for that right.Yet so many of the Black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification.But they were undeterred.Without fanfare or recognition, they organized, testified, rallied, marched and fought , not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table. These women and the generations that followed worked to make democracy and opportunity real in the lives of all of us who followed.They paved the way for the trailblazing leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.And these women inspired us to pick up the torch , and fight on.Women like Mary Church Terrell and Mary McCleod Bethune. Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash. Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm.We\u2019re not often taught their stories. But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders.There\u2019s another woman, whose name isn\u2019t known, whose story isn\u2019t shared. Another woman whose shoulders I stand on. And that\u2019s my mother , Shyamala Gopalan Harris.She came here from India at age 19 to pursue her dream of curing cancer. At the University of California Berkeley, she met my father, Donald Harris, who had come from Jamaica to study economics.They fell in love in that most American way , while marching together for justice in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.In the streets of Oakland and Berkeley, I got a stroller\u2019s-eye view of people getting into what the great John Lewis called \u201cgood trouble.\u201dWhen I was 5, my parents split and my mother raised us mostly on her own. Like so many mothers, she worked around the clock to make it work , packing lunches before we woke up , and paying bills after we went to bed. Helping us with homework at the kitchen table , and shuttling us to church for choir practice.She made it look easy, though I know it never was.My mother instilled in my sister, Maya, and me the values that would chart the course of our lives.She raised us to be proud, strong Black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage.She taught us to put family first , the family you\u2019re born into and the family you choose.Family is my husband Doug, who I met on a blind date set up by my best friend.Family is our beautiful children, Cole and Ella, who as you just heard, call me Momala.Family is my sister.Family is my best friend, my nieces and my godchildren.Family is my uncles, my aunts and my chithis.Family is Mrs. Shelton , my second mother who lived two doors down and helped raise me.Family is my beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha our Divine 9 and my HBCU brothers and sisters.Family is the friends I turned to when my mother , the most important person in my life , passed away from cancer.And even as she taught us to keep our family at the center of our world, she also pushed us to see a world beyond ourselves.She taught us to be conscious and compassionate about the struggles of all people. To believe public service is a noble cause and the fight for justice is a shared responsibility.That led me to become a lawyer, a district attorney, attorney general and a United States Senator.And at every step of the way, I\u2019ve been guided by the words I spoke from the first time I stood in a courtroom: Kamala Harris, for the people.I\u2019ve fought for children and survivors of sexual assault. I\u2019ve fought against transnational gangs. I took on the biggest banks and helped take down one of the biggest for-profit colleges.I know a predator when I see one.My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she were here tonight but I know she\u2019s looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman , all of five feet tall , who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California.On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America.I do so, committed to the values she taught me. To the word that teaches me to walk by faith, and not by sight. And to a vision passed on through generations of Americans , one that Joe Biden shares. A vision of our nation as a beloved community , where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, where we come from or who we love.A country where we may not agree on every detail, but we are united by the fundamental belief that every human being is of infinite worth, deserving of compassion, dignity and respect.A country where we look out for one another, where we rise and fall as one, where we face our challenges and celebrate our triumphs , together.Today that country feels distant.Donald Trump\u2019s failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods.If you\u2019re a parent struggling with your child\u2019s remote learning, or you\u2019re a teacher struggling on the other side of that screen, you know that what we\u2019re doing right now isn\u2019t working.And we are a nation that\u2019s grieving. Grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs, the loss of opportunities, the loss of normalcy and, yes, the loss of certainty.And while this virus touches us all, let\u2019s be honest, it is not an equal opportunity offender. Black, Latino and Indigenous people are suffering and dying disproportionately.This is not a coincidence. It is the effect of structural racism.Of inequities in education and technology, health care and housing, job security and transportation.The injustice in reproductive and maternal health care. In the excessive use of force by police. And in our broader criminal justice system.This virus has no eyes, and yet it knows exactly how we see each other , and how we treat each other.And let\u2019s be clear , there is no vaccine for racism. We\u2019ve gotta do the work.For George Floyd. For Breonna Taylor. For the lives of too many others to name. For our children. For all of us.We\u2019ve gotta do the work to fulfill that promise of equal justice under law. Because none of us are free until all of us are free .We\u2019re at an inflection point.The constant chaos leaves us adrift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone.It\u2019s a lot.And here\u2019s the thing: We can do better and deserve so much more.We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better and do the important work. A president who will bring all of us together , Black, White, Latino, Asian, Indigenous , to achieve the future we collectively want.We must elect Joe Biden.I knew Joe as vice president. I knew Joe on the campaign trail. But I first got to know Joe as the father of my friend.Joe\u2019s son, Beau, and I served as attorneys general of our states , Delaware and California. During the Great Recession, we spoke on the phone nearly every day, working together to win back billions of dollars for homeowners from the big banks that foreclosed on people\u2019s homes.And Beau and I would talk about his family.How, as a single father, Joe would spend four hours every day riding the train back and forth from Wilmington to Washington. Beau and Hunter got to have breakfast every morning with their dad. They went to sleep every night with the sound of his voice reading bedtime stories. And while they endured an unspeakable loss, these two little boys always knew that they were deeply, unconditionally loved.And what also moved me about Joe is the work he did, as he went back and forth. This is the leader who wrote the Violence Against Women Act , and enacted the Assault Weapons Ban; who, as vice president, implemented the Recovery Act, which brought our country back from the Great Recession. He championed the Affordable Care Act, protecting millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions; who spent decades promoting American values and interests around the world, standing up with our allies and standing up to our adversaries.Right now, we have a president who turns our tragedies into political weapons.Joe will be a president who turns our challenges into purpose.Joe will bring us together to build an economy that doesn\u2019t leave anyone behind. Where a good-paying job is the floor, not the ceiling.Joe will bring us together to end this pandemic and make sure that we are prepared for the next one.Joe will bring us together to squarely face and dismantle racial injustice, furthering the work of generations.Joe and I believe that we can build that beloved community, one that is strong and decent, just and kind. One in which we all can see ourselves.That\u2019s the vision that our parents and grandparents fought for. The vision that made my own life possible. The vision that makes the American promise , for all its complexities and imperfections , a promise worth fighting for.Make no mistake, the road ahead will not be not easy. We will stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly. We will speak truths. And we will act with the same faith in you that we ask you to place in us.We believe that our country , all of us , will stand together for a better future. We already are.We see it in the doctors, the nurses, the home health care workers and the frontline workers who are risking their lives to save people they\u2019ve never met.We see it in the teachers and truck drivers, the factory workers and farmers, the postal workers and the poll workers, all putting their own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic.And we see it in so many of you who are working, not just to get us through our current crises but to somewhere better.There\u2019s something happening all across the country.It\u2019s not about Joe or me.It\u2019s about you.It\u2019s about us. People of all ages and colors and creeds who are, yes, taking to the streets, and also persuading our family members, rallying our friends, organizing our neighbors and getting out the vote.And we\u2019ve shown that, when we vote, we expand access to health care, expand access to the ballot box and ensure that more working families can make a decent living.I\u2019m so inspired by a new generation of leadership. You are pushing us to realize the ideals of our nation, pushing us to live the values we share: decency and fairness, justice and love.You are the patriots who remind us that to love our country is to fight for the ideals of our country.In this election, we have a chance to change the course of history. We\u2019re all in this fight.You, me and Joe , together.What an awesome responsibility. What an awesome privilege.So, let\u2019s fight with conviction. Let\u2019s fight with hope.

Women and men who believed so fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all.This week marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment. And we celebrate the women who fought for that right.Yet so many of the Black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification.But they were undeterred.Without fanfare or recognition, they organized, testified, rallied, marched and fought , not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table. These women and the generations that followed worked to make democracy and opportunity real in the lives of all of us who followed.They paved the way for the trailblazing leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.And these women inspired us to pick up the torch , and fight on.Women like Mary Church Terrell and Mary McCleod Bethune. Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash. Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm.We're not often taught their stories. But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders.There's another woman, whose name isn't known, whose story isn't shared. Another woman whose shoulders I stand on. And that's my mother , Shyamala Gopalan Harris.She came here from India at age 19 to pursue her dream of curing cancer. At the University of California Berkeley, she met my father, Donald Harris, who had come from Jamaica to study economics.They fell in love in that most American way , while marching together for justice in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.In the streets of Oakland and Berkeley, I got a stroller's-eye view of people getting into what the great John Lewis called 'good trouble.'When I was 5, my parents split and my mother raised us mostly on her own. Like so many mothers, she worked around the clock to make it work , packing lunches before we woke up , and paying bills after we went to bed. Helping us with homework at the kitchen table , and shuttling us to church for choir practice.She made it look easy, though I know it never was.My mother instilled in my sister, Maya, and me the values that would chart the course of our lives.She raised us to be proud, strong Black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage.She taught us to put family first , the family you're born into and the family you choose.Family is my husband Doug, who I met on a blind date set up by my best friend.Family is our beautiful children, Cole and Ella, who as you just heard, call me Momala.Family is my sister.Family is my best friend, my nieces and my godchildren.Family is my uncles, my aunts and my chithis.Family is Mrs. Shelton , my second mother who lived two doors down and helped raise me.Family is my beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha our Divine 9 and my HBCU brothers and sisters.Family is the friends I turned to when my mother , the most important person in my life , passed away from cancer.And even as she taught us to keep our family at the center of our world, she also pushed us to see a world beyond ourselves.She taught us to be conscious and compassionate about the struggles of all people. To believe public service is a noble cause and the fight for justice is a shared responsibility.That led me to become a lawyer, a district attorney, attorney general and a United States Senator.And at every step of the way, I've been guided by the words I spoke from the first time I stood in a courtroom: Kamala Harris, for the people.I've fought for children and survivors of sexual assault. I've fought against transnational gangs. I took on the biggest banks and helped take down one of the biggest for-profit colleges.I know a predator when I see one.My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she were here tonight but I know she's looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman , all of five feet tall , who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California.On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America.I do so, committed to the values she taught me. To the word that teaches me to walk by faith, and not by sight. And to a vision passed on through generations of Americans , one that Joe Biden shares. A vision of our nation as a beloved community , where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, where we come from or who we love.A country where we may not agree on every detail, but we are united by the fundamental belief that every human being is of infinite worth, deserving of compassion, dignity and respect.A country where we look out for one another, where we rise and fall as one, where we face our challenges and celebrate our triumphs , together.Today that country feels distant.Donald Trump's failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods.If you're a parent struggling with your child's remote learning, or you're a teacher struggling on the other side of that screen, you know that what we're doing right now isn't working.And we are a nation that's grieving. Grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs, the loss of opportunities, the loss of normalcy and, yes, the loss of certainty.And while this virus touches us all, let's be honest, it is not an equal opportunity offender. Black, Latino and Indigenous people are suffering and dying disproportionately.This is not a coincidence. It is the effect of structural racism.Of inequities in education and technology, health care and housing, job security and transportation.The injustice in reproductive and maternal health care. In the excessive use of force by police. And in our broader criminal justice system.This virus has no eyes, and yet it knows exactly how we see each other , and how we treat each other.And let's be clear , there is no vaccine for racism. We've gotta do the work.For George Floyd. For Breonna Taylor. For the lives of too many others to name. For our children. For all of us.We've gotta do the work to fulfill that promise of equal justice under law. Because none of us are free until all of us are free .We're at an inflection point.The constant chaos leaves us adrift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone.It's a lot.And here's the thing: We can do better and deserve so much more.We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better and do the important work. A president who will bring all of us together , Black, White, Latino, Asian, Indigenous , to achieve the future we collectively want.We must elect Joe Biden.I knew Joe as vice president. I knew Joe on the campaign trail. But I first got to know Joe as the father of my friend.Joe's son, Beau, and I served as attorneys general of our states , Delaware and California. During the Great Recession, we spoke on the phone nearly every day, working together to win back billions of dollars for homeowners from the big banks that foreclosed on people's homes.And Beau and I would talk about his family.How, as a single father, Joe would spend four hours every day riding the train back and forth from Wilmington to Washington. Beau and Hunter got to have breakfast every morning with their dad. They went to sleep every night with the sound of his voice reading bedtime stories. And while they endured an unspeakable loss, these two little boys always knew that they were deeply, unconditionally loved.And what also moved me about Joe is the work he did, as he went back and forth. This is the leader who wrote the Violence Against Women Act , and enacted the Assault Weapons Ban; who, as vice president, implemented the Recovery Act, which brought our country back from the Great Recession. He championed the Affordable Care Act, protecting millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions; who spent decades promoting American values and interests around the world, standing up with our allies and standing up to our adversaries.Right now, we have a president who turns our tragedies into political weapons.Joe will be a president who turns our challenges into purpose.Joe will bring us together to build an economy that doesn't leave anyone behind. Where a good-paying job is the floor, not the ceiling.Joe will bring us together to end this pandemic and make sure that we are prepared for the next one.Joe will bring us together to squarely face and dismantle racial injustice, furthering the work of generations.Joe and I believe that we can build that beloved community, one that is strong and decent, just and kind. One in which we all can see ourselves.That's the vision that our parents and grandparents fought for. The vision that made my own life possible. The vision that makes the American promise , for all its complexities and imperfections , a promise worth fighting for.Make no mistake, the road ahead will not be not easy. We will stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly. We will speak truths. And we will act with the same faith in you that we ask you to place in us.We believe that our country , all of us , will stand together for a better future. We already are.We see it in the doctors, the nurses, the home health care workers and the frontline workers who are risking their lives to save people they've never met.We see it in the teachers and truck drivers, the factory workers and farmers, the postal workers and the poll workers, all putting their own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic.And we see it in so many of you who are working, not just to get us through our current crises but to somewhere better.There's something happening all across the country.It's not about Joe or me.It's about you.It's about us. People of all ages and colors and creeds who are, yes, taking to the streets, and also persuading our family members, rallying our friends, organizing our neighbors and getting out the vote.And we've shown that, when we vote, we expand access to health care, expand access to the ballot box and ensure that more working families can make a decent living.I'm so inspired by a new generation of leadership. You are pushing us to realize the ideals of our nation, pushing us to live the values we share: decency and fairness, justice and love.You are the patriots who remind us that to love our country is to fight for the ideals of our country.In this election, we have a chance to change the course of history. We're all in this fight.You, me and Joe , together.What an awesome responsibility. What an awesome privilege.So, let's fight with conviction. Let's fight with hope. Let's fight with confidence in ourselves, and a commitment to each other , to the America we know is possible, the America we love.Years from now, this moment will have passed. And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and ask us: 'Where were you when the stakes were so high?'They will ask us, 'What was it like?'And we will tell them. We will tell them not just how we felt.We will tell them what we did.Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America."}
{"SpeechID":"MEKH278202011","POTUS":"Kamala Harris","Date":"2020-08-27","SpeechTitle":"Senator Harris remarks in advance of the Republican National Convention tonight","RawText":"Good afternoon.On this eve of the 57th March on Washington, I will speak about the recent events in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The wildfires raging across the California coast to the Rocky Mountains. The storm which is working its way through Texas, Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. And most of all , about who we are as a country. We are a nation that, at its best, loves, protects, and helps our fellow Americans.Today, we see pain, hurt, and destruction in the ashes of wildfires and the damage of Hurricane Laura.We encourage everyone to continue following guidance from your local authorities to stay safe.And Joe and I pledge to be there for those whose lives have been turned upside down.Those who will need help from neighbors, strangers, and our government to make it through, to build back, to restore your lives and your communities.We also see pain, hurt, and destruction in the aftermath of yet another Black man shot by police.Jacob Blake, shot 7 times in the back in broad daylight in front of his 3 young sons. 7 times in the back in broad daylight in front of his 3 sons.As Vice President Biden put it, the shots fired at Mr. Blake pierced the soul of our nation.It\u2019s sickening to watch. It\u2019s all too familiar. And it must end.Thankfully, he is alive today. But he is fighting for his life and shouldn\u2019t have to be. My heart goes out to the Blake family, as they endure an ordeal that is tragically common in our country. Joe and I spoke with them yesterday. They are an amazing group of people with extraordinary courage. Even in their pain and grief, even as they seek justice for their son , they spoke about the need to end the violence and heal our nation. I\u2019ve had conversations like this with far too many mothers and fathers , but you will see and hear no one with more courage, more character, and more moral clarity.People are rightfully angry and exhausted. And after the murders of Breonna, George, Ahmaud, and so many others, it\u2019s no wonder people are taking to the streets. And I support them. We must always defend peaceful protest , and peaceful protestors. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence, including, the shooter who was arrested for murder. And make no mistake, we will not let these vigilantes and extremists derail the path to justice. Here\u2019s my promise to those mothers and fathers, and all who stand with them:In a Biden-Harris Administration, you will have a seat at the table , in the Halls of Congress, and in the White House.We all grew up reciting the pledge of allegiance, but now, we must give real meaning to its words.One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.Justice. Let\u2019s talk about that. Because the reality is that the life of a Black person in America has never been treated as fully human , and we have yet to fulfill that promise of equal justice under law. We will only achieve that when we finally come together to pass meaningful police reform and broader criminal justice reform, and acknowledge, yes acknowledge, and address systemic racism.We will only come closer to achieving that when we finally come together.We have come a long way in our country towards building a more perfect Union, and the time is now , right now , to take the next step forward.And even as we experience this reckoning with racial injustice, we must also confront another crisis:The pandemic that has torn apart so many lives.The numbers that define this crisis are staggering.We cannot look the other way or allow ourselves to become numb to them.Nearly 6 million confirmed cases of the coronavirus.180,000 lives lost.More than 50 million claims for unemployment this year alone.We need to see , and we need to hear , what\u2019s happening in our country.The quiet desperation that has taken over so many lives in America.The family packing into their car at 5 in the morning , hoping the local food bank still has something left when they get to the front of the line.The 50-year old store manager who\u2019s been laid off , and knows he can\u2019t pay the rent on the 1st of the month.The mothers and fathers stretched to the breaking point , working from home while helping their kids with online classes , just trying to hold it all together.The small business owners , economic engines of our communities , who are shutting their doors every day.The nurse getting ready for her afternoon shift , who has seen so much suffering and death in recent months , and wonders how much more she can bear to witness.The family grieving the loss of their grandmother who has been in a nursing home , who they couldn\u2019t even visit over the last three months of her life.The alarming and disproportionate rate at which Black, Latino, and Indigenous families are contracting and dying of COVID-19.That is the reality of America right now. A reality completely absent from this week\u2019s Republican National Convention.Because unlike the Democratic convention, which was clear-eyed about the challenges we are facing and how we will tackle them.The Republican convention is designed for one purpose , to soothe Donald Trump\u2019s ego. To make him feel good. But here\u2019s the thing, he\u2019s the President of the United States. And it\u2019s not Supposed to be about him.It\u2019s supposed to be about the health, and the safety, and the well-being of the American people.And on that measure, Donald Trump has failed.You see, at its most basic level, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t understand the presidency.He thinks it\u2019s all about him. Well, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about you. It\u2019s about all of us. The People.As a lawyer and advocate, when I would rise to speak in a courtroom, I\u2019d say the following words:Kamala Harris for the people. And that is why I stand here today , to speak for the people. Because we know the truth.Donald Trump has failed at the most basic and important job of a President of the United States. He failed to protect the American people. Plain and simple. Trump showed what we, in the legal profession, would call a reckless disregard for the well-being of the American people.A reckless disregard for the danger a pandemic would pose to American lives. For the devastation it would do to our economy. For the damage it would do to communities of color who have been subjected to structural racism for generations.For the chaos that would upend our daily lives make it impossible for many of our kids to go to school make it impossible to live normally and with certainty.He never appreciated that a President swears an oath before God and country to protect America against threats seen and unseen.It\u2019s his duty. It\u2019s his obligation to protect us.And yet, he has failed. Miserably. Here\u2019s the thing, Donald Trump\u2019s incompetence is nothing new.That has always been on full display. But in January of this year, it became deadly. That\u2019s when the threat of a virus that would endanger the world first emerged.Trump dismissed the threat. Joe Biden, sounded the alarm. It would be the beginning of a pattern that persists to this day.Trump telling us not to worry, that the virus will, quote, \u201cdisappear,\u201d that a quote, \u201cmiracle\u201d is coming. Joe Biden, saying we need a plan, a national strategy, a President who is willing to lead, willing to be a role model for our nation. For our children. Trump still doesn\u2019t have a plan.Joe Biden, released his first plan in March. Here\u2019s what you have to understand about the nature of a pandemic. It\u2019s relentless. You can\u2019t stop it with a tweet. You can\u2019t create a distraction and hope it\u2019ll go away. It doesn\u2019t go away. By its nature, a pandemic is unforgiving. If you get it wrong at the beginning, the consequences are catastrophic. It\u2019s very hard to catch up. You don\u2019t get a second chance at getting it right. Well, President Trump got it wrong in the beginning.And then, he got it wrong again and again.And the consequences have been catastrophic. And here\u2019s why Trump has been so unwilling and unable to deal with this crisis: First, he was fixated on the stock market over fixing the problem.He tweeted about it consistently during this period.He was convinced that if his administration focused on this virus, it would hurt the market and hurt his chances of being reelected.That mattered more to him than saving American lives. Second, right at the moment that we needed Donald Trump to be tough on the Chinese government, he caved.On January 24th, he praised the transparency of the Chinese government.He said, quote, \u201cChina has been working hard to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.\u201dBut they weren\u2019t being transparent. They blocked public health inspectors from the CDC, from getting the access and information they needed to protect American lives.Donald Trump stood idly by. And folks, it was a deadly decision.Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Donald Trump froze. He was scared. He was petty and vindictive.On a call with governors across the country on March 16th, he told them it wasn\u2019t his job to get personal protective equipment to frontline workers.He said, quote: \u201cRespirators, ventilators, all of the equipment, try getting it yourselves.\u201d Unquote.On that day we had about 5,000 cases as a nation.Today we have nearly 6 million.Even now , some eight months into this crisis , Donald Trump still won\u2019t take responsibility. He still won\u2019t act. The tragedy in all of this is it didn\u2019t have to be this bad. Just look around. It\u2019s not like this in the rest of the world.All we needed was a competent president , one who was willing to listen, willing to lead, take responsibility, have a plan, do their job.Joe Biden will be that president.He\u2019s got a national strategy.He\u2019s more than ready to lead.Every month since March as this pandemic has unfolded, Joe Biden has updated the steps he would take to save American lives. And he\u2019s done it based on what every scientist, every expert, every economist, said we should be doing.As President, Joe Biden will put a plan into effect on day one.Develop and deploy rapid tests with immediate results.Make sure testing, treatments, and ultimately, a vaccine reach all Americans, including communities of color, who have historically been left behind.Manufacture the medical supplies and protective equipment we need.And make them right here , in America, so we\u2019re never again at the mercy of China and other foreign countries to protect our own people. Joe and I will make sure our schools have all the resources they need , to be open, safe, and effective.Put politics aside , and not silence the experts , so the public gets the information they need and deserve.And put in place a nationwide mask Mandate , in Joe\u2019s words, it\u2019s not a burden to protect each other.Because he knows we\u2019re all in this together.Donald Trump says there\u2019s nothing he could have done to prevent all this death.Here\u2019s the truth: Barack Obama and Joe Biden had a program called PREDICT that tracked emerging diseases in places like China. I\u2019m going to repeat that. The program tracked emerging diseases in places like China. Trump cut it.They dedicated a team on the National Security Council to global health security and biodefense. Donald Trump eliminated it.They implemented standards for nursing homes to improve infection control. Trump is erasing them.Before the virus hit, Trump made our country vulnerable. After it was struck, he failed to do what was necessary.As it continues, he\u2019s making it worse every day.Just this week, the Social Security Administration said a cut to Social Security like the one Trump is proposing would end disability benefits within one year and end All benefits within 3 years.Let me be as clear as possible, if Donald Trump\u2019s extreme proposal goes into effect, the checks that America\u2019s seniors rely on to pay your bills, to buy your medicine , to live , will stop coming.The very people who have suffered so greatly in this crisis.It\u2019s unthinkable.And in the middle of a health crisis made worse by his own actions, Donald Trump is in court right now trying to throw out the entire Affordable Care Act, including the protections it provides for people with pre-existing conditions.That means, if you are fortunate enough to survive COVID-19, insurers could deny you coverage for treating any long-term effects.Now President Trump, won\u2019t tell you any of this at the Republican convention tonight.And we all know he\u2019s not changing.The president he has been , is the president he will be.But we have a chance to right these wrongs and put America on a better path forward.One where the leaders we elect listen to the experts and follow the best medical guidance to keep us and our families healthy and safe.One where we take meaningful action against systems and traditions of oppression.One where we stop fanning the flames of hate and division, and treat one another with the respect and dignity that each one of us deserves.As Joe Biden said in his acceptance speech, we have a choice between the light and the dark.I believe America will choose the light.Thank you.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/kamalaharris.medium.com\/senator-harris-remarks-in-advance-of-the-republican-national-convention-tonight-92386cf937af?source=user_profile---------11----------------------------","Summary":"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Senator Kamala Harris in Washington, DC","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Good afternoon.On this eve of the 57th March on Washington, I will speak about the recent events in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

They blocked public health inspectors from the CDC, from getting the access and information they needed to protect American lives.Donald Trump stood idly by. And folks, it was a deadly decision.Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Donald Trump froze. He was scared. He was petty and vindictive.On a call with governors across the country on March 16th, he told them it wasn't his job to get personal protective equipment to frontline workers.He said, quote: 'Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment, try getting it yourselves.' Unquote.On that day we had about 5,000 cases as a nation.Today we have nearly 6 million.Even now , some eight months into this crisis , Donald Trump still won't take responsibility. He still won't act. The tragedy in all of this is it didn't have to be this bad. Just look around. It's not like this in the rest of the world.All we needed was a competent president , one who was willing to listen, willing to lead, take responsibility, have a plan, do their job.Joe Biden will be that president.He's got a national strategy.He's more than ready to lead.Every month since March as this pandemic has unfolded, Joe Biden has updated the steps he would take to save American lives. And he's done it based on what every scientist, every expert, every economist, said we should be doing.As President, Joe Biden will put a plan into effect on day one.Develop and deploy rapid tests with immediate results.Make sure testing, treatments, and ultimately, a vaccine reach all Americans, including communities of color, who have historically been left behind.Manufacture the medical supplies and protective equipment we need.And make them right here , in America, so we're never again at the mercy of China and other foreign countries to protect our own people. Joe and I will make sure our schools have all the resources they need , to be open, safe, and effective.Put politics aside , and not silence the experts , so the public gets the information they need and deserve.And put in place a nationwide mask Mandate , in Joe's words, it's not a burden to protect each other.Because he knows we're all in this together.Donald Trump says there's nothing he could have done to prevent all this death.Here's the truth: Barack Obama and Joe Biden had a program called PREDICT that tracked emerging diseases in places like China. I'm going to repeat that. The program tracked emerging diseases in places like China. Trump cut it.They dedicated a team on the National Security Council to global health security and biodefense. Donald Trump eliminated it.They implemented standards for nursing homes to improve infection control. Trump is erasing them.Before the virus hit, Trump made our country vulnerable. After it was struck, he failed to do what was necessary.As it continues, he's making it worse every day.Just this week, the Social Security Administration said a cut to Social Security like the one Trump is proposing would end disability benefits within one year and end All benefits within 3 years.Let me be as clear as possible, if Donald Trump's extreme proposal goes into effect, the checks that America's seniors rely on to pay your bills, to buy your medicine , to live , will stop coming.The very people who have suffered so greatly in this crisis.It's unthinkable.And in the middle of a health crisis made worse by his own actions, Donald Trump is in court right now trying to throw out the entire Affordable Care Act, including the protections it provides for people with pre-existing conditions.That means, if you are fortunate enough to survive COVID-19, insurers could deny you coverage for treating any long-term effects.Now President Trump, won't tell you any of this at the Republican convention tonight.And we all know he's not changing.The president he has been , is the president he will be.But we have a chance to right these wrongs and put America on a better path forward.One where the leaders we elect listen to the experts and follow the best medical guidance to keep us and our families healthy and safe.One where we take meaningful action against systems and traditions of oppression.One where we stop fanning the flames of hate and division, and treat one another with the respect and dignity that each one of us deserves.As Joe Biden said in his acceptance speech, we have a choice between the light and the dark.I believe America will choose the light.Thank you."}
{"SpeechID":"MEKH289202010","POTUS":"Kamala Harris","Date":"2020-09-28","SpeechTitle":"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the future of the Supreme Court","RawText":"Good afternoon.On Friday morning, I attended the memorial service of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the U.S. Capitol.She was the first woman in our history to lie in state.I sat a few feet away from her flag-draped casket to pay my respects.It was somber and personal.And it was an extraordinary moment for me , as I\u2019m sure it was for you and millions of Americans, and people around the world who felt a connection with her.It was sad because we lost a giant not only of the Court, but of American life.It was a celebration.Few people in our history have done more to change the lives of the American people than Ruth Bader Ginsburg did as a lawyer, an advocate, and a Supreme Court Justice.And it was an inspiration and a call to each of us.For each of us to be better, to stay in the fight , and stay committed to what motivated Justice Ginsburg the most.That phrase etched in the marble of the United States Supreme Court: \u201cEqual Justice Under Law.\u201dJustice Ginsburg came to her view of the law not from a textbook, but from life.Her own life. She often told the story of how she had personally felt the sting of discrimination.As a woman.As the mother of a young child, trying to find work.And so she committed her life step by step, case by case, law by law, to tear down the obstacles in the way of so many, especially women.Now, we are about to undertake the task of finding her replacement on the United States Supreme Court.Of course, it\u2019s hard to say those words.In truth, Ruth Bader Ginsburg cannot be replaced.She was an original. A one of a kind.She combined a steel spine with an ability to extend an open hand, never a closed fist.She demonstrated you could both hold firm to your principles and still hear those with whom you disagree.That is a lesson that should be ringing in our ears.But it looks like this President and his party aren\u2019t interested in hearing any lessons from Justice Ginsburg.Already, the President and his Republicans have chosen to ignore Justice Ginsburg\u2019s final wish , to hold off the nomination to replace her until after the next president is chosen.A wish, by the way, shared by the American people.And it\u2019s not complicated.The voters would simply like to have the opportunity to vote for their President before the Senate votes on a nominee.That\u2019s not too much to ask.But President Trump and his party aren\u2019t interested in hearing the will of the people.In fact, my sense is they\u2019re afraid of what they\u2019re going to be told.We are not even debating whether the Senate should hold hearings on a nominee in an election year.We\u2019re not in the middle of an election year.We\u2019re in the middle of an election.An on-going election.Almost a million Americans have already voted.More will vote this week.In just a few weeks, all Americans will have voted.But President Trump and his party don\u2019t care.They just want to jam this nomination through as fast as they can.It\u2019s raw power.But President Trump and his party are about to learn something.They may think that it is they who have the power in this country.But they don\u2019t.The American people have the power , you have the power.And you can make it very clear, very soon how you feel about being cut out of this Supreme Court nomination.Even worse, though, than the President and his party ignoring Justice Ginsburg\u2019s final wish , is their determination to appoint a Justice who will undo her life\u2019s work.Let\u2019s be clear. The Supreme Court will impact our lives in three critical ways.First, President Trump and his party have made it clear they will pick a justice who will get rid of the Affordable Care Act.And, in fact, just days after the election the court will hear a case that could strike down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety.It\u2019s a decision that could take away health care for 20 million Americans.It is a decision that could take away protections for preexisting conditions for more than 100 million people in our country.It\u2019s a decision that could take away Medicare benefits for seniors.It is a decision that could toss out the rule that says children can be covered on their parents\u2019 health care up to the age of 26.All of that will hurt the millions of Americans who have come to rely on the Affordable Care Act.And what is especially offensive about what President Trump and his party are up to is this.Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take us backward to a time when you could charge a woman more for her health care than you can charge a man , just because she\u2019s a woman.Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take us backward to a time when pregnancy could be considered a pre-existing condition.Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take away birth control and contraceptive coverage for women.And get this.This relentless obsession with overturning the Affordable Care Act , driven entirely by a blind rage toward President Obama , is happening at a moment when our country is suffering through the ravages of a pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives.Complications from COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, could well become the next pre-existing condition.In short, there are few things they could that would be more offensive to the legacy of Justice Ginsburg than to return us to the full-scale policies of discrimination in health care toward the women of our country.But that\u2019s what overturning the Affordable Care Act will do.And overturning the Affordable Care Act is a way a nominee gets the support of this president and his party.As Attorney General of California, I defended your right to health care.As Senator, I voted to protect your right to health care.But now President Trump has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett. And we know where Judge Barrett stands on the Affordable Care Act.Judge Barrett is on record opposing the decision that upheld the Affordable Care Act.As recently as 2017, she specifically attacked the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion in an article saying, quote: \u201cChief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.\u201dIf nothing else, the voters should be very clear about one thing: President Trump and his party and Judge Barrett will overturn the Affordable Care Act.And they won\u2019t stop there.They have made clear that they want to overturn Roe v. Wade and restrict reproductive rights and freedoms.Judge Barrett has a long record of opposing abortion and reproductive rights.There is no other issue that so disrespects and dishonors the work of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s life than undoing the seminal decision in the Court\u2019s history that made it clear a woman has the right to control her own body.But that\u2019s where President Trump and his party and Judge Barrett are.So let\u2019s make it clear where we are.Let\u2019s vote for health care. Vote for the Affordable Care Act.Vote as if your life, your choice, depends on it , because it does.Make it clear to President Trump and to every Republican Senator that if they\u2019re determined to get rid of your health care, you\u2019ll be just as determined to vote them out.And second, vote as if your right to vote depends on it , because it does.In 2013, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Shelby County v. Holder gutted the heart of the Voting Rights Act. Soon after, numerous states, including Texas, North Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi enacted discriminatory laws designed to suppress people\u2019s right to vote, targeting people of color and students. Justice Ginsburg wrote that the decision was like \u201cthrowing away your umbrella in a rainstorm.\u201d Right here in North Carolina a voter suppression law was described by a federal court as having \u201ctargeted African Americans with almost surgical precision\u201d to deny us the right to vote. Surgical precision. After the people of Florida voted to grant formerly incarcerated citizens the right to vote, Republican officials recently enacted a modern-day poll tax to make it harder for those citizens to exercise that very right , in this upcoming election. And this modern-day poll tax was upheld by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals , in large part because of judges appointed by Donald Trump. But he knows he can\u2019t win if the people vote. Donald Trump is weak. So he is throwing up every roadblock he can to suppress the vote. And we, the people, can\u2019t let him get away with it. Third, our ability to make a living, take care of our families, and dismantle systemic racism , well, that\u2019s at stake, too. For example, court decisions can determine your ability to earn a living wage, to receive equal pay for equal work, or collectively bargain for your rights at work.With an extra vote on the Court, Donald Trump and his party will continue their attack on laws that keep our air clean and our food and water safe , and attack any legislation that addresses climate change.They will also continue to divide us and ignore the systemic racism that still plagues our society.Their decisions could fail to hold the actors in our criminal justice system accountable.Victims of abuse of power by law enforcement could be less likely to succeed on their civil rights claims.The due process rights of criminal defendants could be less likely to be vigorously enforced.These are decisions that would upend Justice Ginsburg\u2019s life\u2019s work to uphold the basic civil rights of all Americans , regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or economic station. Yes, she was part of our culture. Yes, we wear those \u201cNotorious RBG\u201d t-shirts with a lot of pride. But since she passed, there are parents reminding their children that she helped their lives in concrete yet immeasurable ways. Because of her, they could get the job of their dreams, fight for equal pay for their work, marry the person they love, serve the country they love , and enjoy the full rights and privileges of citizenship that they deserve, free of discrimination. And that legacy , her belief in all of us , is at stake. The outcome of this election, more than any other in our lifetime, affects every part of your life and every branch of government , all at once with consequences that can last generations. And all with a nation in crisis and at a crossroads. The pandemic. The recession. A reckoning on racial injustice. A changing climate. A crisis with the nomination to the Supreme Court.I know sometimes it feels like it\u2019s all just too much for our country to take. And that\u2019s what they want you to believe. They want you to feel tired. To feel your fight doesn\u2019t matter. But we will not give up. And we will not give in. We won\u2019t let the infection that President Trump has injected into the presidency and into Congress , that has paralyzed our politics and pitted Americans against each other , spread to the Supreme Court.This election is about more than the presidency or the Senate or the Supreme Court. It\u2019s about our democracy. And, as Joe Biden has said from the moment he entered this race, it\u2019s about the soul of our nation. Who we are. What we stand for. And maybe most importantly, who we want to be. And that\u2019s what I felt when I said goodbye to Justice Ginsburg. She understood the soul of our nation. And what is expected of each of us. And that belief is especially resonant at a place like Shaw University, one of our nation\u2019s first Black landmarks of higher learning, established just six months after the Civil War.People born into bondage and brutality stood on this very ground as graduates and as scholars.I stand here in Estey Hall , the country\u2019s first university hall built to educate Black women.A century later, and a few months after the Greensboro sit-ins, Ella Baker and fellow students at Shaw established the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee , that our dear John Lewis would one day lead.I stand here, on their shoulders, and with all of you, as the nominee for Vice President of the United States.I stand with Joe Biden who will be your next President.I stand with Cal Cunningham who will be your next Senator from North Carolina.And I stand with them and the American people, to fight for a Supreme Court Justice, who, like Justice Ginsburg, truly believes in \u201cEqual Justice Under Law.\u201dMay God bless Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.May God bless you all.May God bless the United States of America.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/kamalaharris.medium.com\/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-and-the-future-of-the-supreme-court-89aadc32fbb9?source=user_profile---------10----------------------------","Summary":"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Senator Kamala Harris on the U.S. Supreme Court in Raleigh, North Carolina","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"Good afternoon.On Friday morning, I attended the memorial service of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the U.S. Capitol.She was the first woman in our history to lie in state.I sat a few feet away from her flag-draped casket to pay my respects.It was somber and personal.And it was an extraordinary moment for me , as I'm sure it was for you and millions of Americans, and people around the world who felt a connection with her.It was sad because we lost a giant not only of the Court, but of American life.It was a celebration.Few people in our history have done more to change the lives of the American people than Ruth Bader Ginsburg did as a lawyer, an advocate, and a Supreme Court Justice.And it was an inspiration and a call to each of us.For each of us to be better, to stay in the fight , and stay committed to what motivated Justice Ginsburg the most.That phrase etched in the marble of the United States Supreme Court: 'Equal Justice Under Law.'Justice Ginsburg came to her view of the law not from a textbook, but from life.Her own life.

Joe\u2019s here. Jill\u2019s here. Doug\u2019s here. You are here. We are here. To bring this election home! And we\u2019ve got one more day. This is it. Joe and I are just so grateful. For your support, your prayers, your love. For your time , volunteering, making calls. For your trust in us. And for your vote. And as we head into tomorrow, I know we are empowered. We are optimistic about our future. We know the strength of unity. We know the strength of America. When Joe asked me to join this ticket, saying yes was an easy decision. We come from different backgrounds , but we were raised, with the same values. Hard work. Honesty. Decency. A belief that we all have a responsibility to look out for one another. And those are the values I\u2019ve seen as I\u2019ve traveled across our country over the past 84 days. The values we share as Americans. Across our country, you can feel something\u2019s happening. In big cities and small towns , wearing masks and social distancing , I\u2019ve seen people lining the streets and gathering on corners to show their support. They\u2019re bringing their children, holding up signs, wearing their colors and strolling to the polls, and waving the red, white and blue. The energy out there is real. It is inspiring. In this battle for the very soul of our nation , we have seen what can be, unburdened by what has been. We\u2019ve seen who we are. The country we love. And that is why I know that tomorrow we are going to elect Joe Biden to be the next President of the United States! GOTV So, tell me, how many of you already voted? Honk if you\u2019ve voted! Now, if you haven\u2019t voted yet , go to IWillVote.com to find out when and where you can vote tomorrow. Honk if you\u2019ve been sending texts and making calls to get out the vote. Cause we all know from the time the polls open tomorrow morning until they close, every minute counts. So we can\u2019t let up because it ain\u2019t over till it\u2019s over. And everything is at stake. Our health, our economy, our children\u2019s futures. A woman\u2019s right to make decisions about her own body. A criminal justice system that treats all people equally and with dignity. A Supreme Court that advances the legacy of Justice Ginsburg. That lives up to the phrase above its entrance: Equal Justice Under Law. The kind of country we want to be. It\u2019s all on the line. This is the most consequential election of our lifetimes , and the decision we make will last for generations. And as I travel around, one of the biggest issues on everyone\u2019s mind is the pandemic that is ravaging our country. And remember back in January, Donald Trump knew just how bad the coronavirus was. That it was deadly and airborne. But what did he do with that information? He looked straight into the cameras at the American people and lied about it. He covered it up. Can you imagine if you knew on January 28th what he knew? Can you imagine how your family might have been able to prepare? Can you imagine how our businesses, how our schools might have been able to prepare? How we as a country might have been able to prepare? But President Trump doesn\u2019t think about what\u2019s best for America. He only thinks about what\u2019s best for himself. And as a result, we have lost 230 thousand lives to COVID. So many people forced to die alone because of the nature of this virus. 230 thousand Americans. The last time we experienced loss like this was World War Two. In addition, we\u2019re looking at over 9 million people who have contracted the virus. And we know it\u2019s hitting communities of color hardest. Latinos are contracting COVID at 3 times the rate of others. Black folks are dying at 2 times the rate of others. And let\u2019s be clear. We are also in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression because President Trump failed to contain this virus. He failed to lead. 23 million people are receiving unemployment. 1 in 5 mothers with children under the age of 12 describe them as hungry. 1 in 6 households are behind on rent. 1 in 4 small businesses have closed. And yet, 9 months into this pandemic, this president still doesn\u2019t have a plan to contain it. We have witnessed the greatest failure of a presidential administration in America\u2019s history. And on top of it all, President Trump is in court right now trying to end the Affordable Care Act and take health coverage away from over 20 million Americans. He\u2019s trying to end protections for the over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. Conditions like asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure or cancer. Honk if you know someone with asthma, diabetes, breast cancer. America, we cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump. The first thing Joe and I will do when we\u2019re in the White House is get this virus under control. We\u2019ll listen to the scientists and public health experts. Provide free testing, treatment and when it\u2019s available, a safe vaccine for all. Provide schools with the guidance and resources they need to reopen safely. And we will build back an economy that actually works for working people. And let me be clear: Joe and I will not increase taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. Period. But we will, ask the super wealthy and biggest corporations to pay their fair share. And we\u2019ll invest those tax dollars to rebuild our nation\u2019s infrastructure. Tackle the climate crisis and create millions of good-paying union jobs. Make child care more affordable and invest in our nation\u2019s schools and teachers. Build on Obamacare and expand access to health care to tens of millions of Americans, including mental health care. Lower prescription drug costs. Protect and expand Medicare and Social Security. We\u2019ll work to root out the systemic racism that still exists in our criminal justice system. Confront white supremacy. And fight for economic justice , no matter your zip code or race. And we\u2019ll begin the work of healing, repairing, and uniting our nation , Democrats. Republicans. And Independents. People of all races and backgrounds. Because that\u2019s how we\u2019ve always overcome our greatest challenges. Together. And Joe gets that. You see, Joe is a leader who understands what the American people are going through. He sees us. He understands suffering because he has experienced it himself. Joe Biden is a leader of both strength and empathy. Toughness and humility. He understands that the measure of a person\u2019s strength is not based on who you put down, but who you lift up. And he knows that no matter where we come from or where we live, no matter our race or gender, background or faith; no matter how we identify or who we love; no matter the language your grandmother speaks; what we have in common is so much stronger than what divides us. That\u2019s the kind of leader America needs right now. And it\u2019s why we must win this election. So remember this:Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. Don\u2019t let anyone take away your power. Now is the time to stand up. Now is the time to speak out. And now is the time to vote. Vote like our lives depend on it. Because they do. Vote like our democracy depends on it. Because it does. Vote like justice, equality, and opportunity , decency, character, and dignity , are on the ballot. Because they are. One day, our children and grandchildren are going to look us in the eye and ask what we did in this moment. And I want to be able to say, we did everything we could to fight for our country and their future. So, let\u2019s do that. Let\u2019s vote. With conviction. Confidence. And hope. And let\u2019s elect Joe Biden the next President of the United States! Thank you.

Are you ready? Joe's here. Jill's here. Doug's here. You are here. We are here. To bring this election home! And we've got one more day. This is it. Joe and I are just so grateful. For your support, your prayers, your love. For your time , volunteering, making calls. For your trust in us. And for your vote. And as we head into tomorrow, I know we are empowered. We are optimistic about our future. We know the strength of unity. We know the strength of America. When Joe asked me to join this ticket, saying yes was an easy decision. We come from different backgrounds , but we were raised, with the same values. Hard work. Honesty. Decency. A belief that we all have a responsibility to look out for one another. And those are the values I've seen as I've traveled across our country over the past 84 days. The values we share as Americans. Across our country, you can feel something's happening. In big cities and small towns , wearing masks and social distancing , I've seen people lining the streets and gathering on corners to show their support. They're bringing their children, holding up signs, wearing their colors and strolling to the polls, and waving the red, white and blue. The energy out there is real. It is inspiring. In this battle for the very soul of our nation , we have seen what can be, unburdened by what has been. We've seen who we are. The country we love. And that is why I know that tomorrow we are going to elect Joe Biden to be the next President of the United States! GOTV So, tell me, how many of you already voted? Honk if you've voted! Now, if you haven't voted yet , go to IWillVote.com to find out when and where you can vote tomorrow. Honk if you've been sending texts and making calls to get out the vote. Cause we all know from the time the polls open tomorrow morning until they close, every minute counts. So we can't let up because it ain't over till it's over. And everything is at stake. Our health, our economy, our children's futures. A woman's right to make decisions about her own body. A criminal justice system that treats all people equally and with dignity. A Supreme Court that advances the legacy of Justice Ginsburg. That lives up to the phrase above its entrance: Equal Justice Under Law. The kind of country we want to be. It's all on the line. This is the most consequential election of our lifetimes , and the decision we make will last for generations. And as I travel around, one of the biggest issues on everyone's mind is the pandemic that is ravaging our country. And remember back in January, Donald Trump knew just how bad the coronavirus was. That it was deadly and airborne. But what did he do with that information? He looked straight into the cameras at the American people and lied about it. He covered it up. Can you imagine if you knew on January 28th what he knew? Can you imagine how your family might have been able to prepare? Can you imagine how our businesses, how our schools might have been able to prepare? How we as a country might have been able to prepare? But President Trump doesn't think about what's best for America. He only thinks about what's best for himself. And as a result, we have lost 230 thousand lives to COVID. So many people forced to die alone because of the nature of this virus. 230 thousand Americans. The last time we experienced loss like this was World War Two. In addition, we're looking at over 9 million people who have contracted the virus. And we know it's hitting communities of color hardest. Latinos are contracting COVID at 3 times the rate of others. Black folks are dying at 2 times the rate of others. And let's be clear. We are also in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression because President Trump failed to contain this virus. He failed to lead. 23 million people are receiving unemployment. 1 in 5 mothers with children under the age of 12 describe them as hungry. 1 in 6 households are behind on rent. 1 in 4 small businesses have closed. And yet, 9 months into this pandemic, this president still doesn't have a plan to contain it. We have witnessed the greatest failure of a presidential administration in America's history. And on top of it all, President Trump is in court right now trying to end the Affordable Care Act and take health coverage away from over 20 million Americans. He's trying to end protections for the over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. Conditions like asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure or cancer. Honk if you know someone with asthma, diabetes, breast cancer. America, we cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump. The first thing Joe and I will do when we're in the White House is get this virus under control. We'll listen to the scientists and public health experts.

To make sure vaccines are safe, free, and equitably distributed.To make sure we are better prepared for future pandemics and other health threats.And to make sure quality, affordable health care is available to all.From an early age, I saw the lifesaving work that our health care professionals provide, especially for the most vulnerable among us.

It\u2019s about dignity and respect.Joe learned that lesson from his father. I learned it from my mother.My mother taught me in her words and her actions, that no matter how you earn a living, whether you\u2019re a caregiver or truck driver, grocery store clerk or small business owner, every job has inherent value and worth.And every worker, everywhere, has a right to earn a living wage, work in safe and healthy conditions, and pursue a better life for themselves and their family.We also know that right now, the dignity of an honest day\u2019s work, and the financial stability of a steady income , are out of reach for millions of Americans.The December jobs report makes that very clear.Food banks are being strained trying to feed people who\u2019ve had to worry, for the first time in their lives, about where to go for their next meal.Essential workers, like the nurses Joe and I called over the holidays, continue to risk their own health and the health of their families for all of us.Small business owners, from restaurants to barber shops to dry cleaners, are hurting.And let\u2019s be clear: those who run America\u2019s small businesses aren\u2019t just business leaders, they\u2019re civic leaders and community leaders. They\u2019re the ones who sponsor Little League games, scholarships, and all kinds of local causes and activities.And we must do right by them.So, first and foremost, as the President-elect has said, we need to provide more immediate relief for working families and businesses , now.And even as we address our immediate crises, even as we work to contain this pandemic and open our economy responsibly, we must also do what President-elect Biden and I have pledged to do:We must build our economy back better.So it lifts up everyone, no matter what you do for a living or where you live, whether it\u2019s in small towns, big cities, or anyplace in between.That means providing access to capital for small business owners , the economic engines of our neighborhoods , so they can create jobs and help our communities thrive.It means making sure we\u2019re equipping workers with the skills they\u2019ll need for the jobs of the future, and making sure our entrepreneurs and businesses continue to out-innovate and out-compete the rest of the world.And it means protecting and expanding workers\u2019 rights by fighting for a higher minimum wage and paid leave, safe and healthy workplaces and stronger unions.From working with unions as San Francisco\u2019s District Attorney, to helping author the Domestic Workers\u2019 Bill of Rights in the U.S. Senate, I can tell you from personal experience, that whether it\u2019s the apprenticeships of the building trades, or the caregiving skills of home health care workers, this is some of the most important work being done in our country.The President-elect and I know that.And so does the team we are announcing today.These leaders, together with the rest of our economic team, will help create millions of good-paying, union jobs, and build an economy that\u2019s stronger, and fairer for working people.They are seasoned public servants with track records of not only standing up for workers and unions, but spurring innovation, and creating opportunity for small business owners.And like President-elect Biden and I, they will fight to honor the dignity of work.The President-elect and I share a vision of America where opportunity is within reach for all The People.Where everyone can see a brighter future for themselves and their children.With the leadership of these public servants and our entire economic team, we will get to work building that America less than two weeks from today.Thank you, Mr. President-elect.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/kamalaharris.medium.com\/building-an-economy-thats-stronger-and-fairer-for-working-people-3ef9f0693fd6?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------","Summary":"Remarks Announcing Labor, Commerce, and SBA Nominations as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in Wilmington, Delaware","Source":null,"Type":null,"Original Source":null,"Location":null,"CleanText":"One of the fundamental values that President-elect Biden and I share is a belief in the dignity of work.We both understand that a job is about more than a paycheck.

I learned it from my mother.My mother taught me in her words and her actions, that no matter how you earn a living, whether you're a caregiver or truck driver, grocery store clerk or small business owner, every job has inherent value and worth.And every worker, everywhere, has a right to earn a living wage, work in safe and healthy conditions, and pursue a better life for themselves and their family.We also know that right now, the dignity of an honest day's work, and the financial stability of a steady income , are out of reach for millions of Americans.The December jobs report makes that very clear.Food banks are being strained trying to feed people who've had to worry, for the first time in their lives, about where to go for their next meal.Essential workers, like the nurses Joe and I called over the holidays, continue to risk their own health and the health of their families for all of us.Small business owners, from restaurants to barber shops to dry cleaners, are hurting.And let's be clear: those who run America's small businesses aren't just business leaders, they're civic leaders and community leaders. They're the ones who sponsor Little League games, scholarships, and all kinds of local causes and activities.And we must do right by them.So, first and foremost, as the President-elect has said, we need to provide more immediate relief for working families and businesses , now.And even as we address our immediate crises, even as we work to contain this pandemic and open our economy responsibly, we must also do what President-elect Biden and I have pledged to do:We must build our economy back better.So it lifts up everyone, no matter what you do for a living or where you live, whether it's in small towns, big cities, or anyplace in between.That means providing access to capital for small business owners , the economic engines of our neighborhoods , so they can create jobs and help our communities thrive.It means making sure we're equipping workers with the skills they'll need for the jobs of the future, and making sure our entrepreneurs and businesses continue to out-innovate and out-compete the rest of the world.And it means protecting and expanding workers' rights by fighting for a higher minimum wage and paid leave, safe and healthy workplaces and stronger unions.From working with unions as San Francisco's District Attorney, to helping author the Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights in the U.S. Senate, I can tell you from personal experience, that whether it's the apprenticeships of the building trades, or the caregiving skills of home health care workers, this is some of the most important work being done in our country.The President-elect and I know that.And so does the team we are announcing today.These leaders, together with the rest of our economic team, will help create millions of good-paying, union jobs, and build an economy that's stronger, and fairer for working people.They are seasoned public servants with track records of not only standing up for workers and unions, but spurring innovation, and creating opportunity for small business owners.And like President-elect Biden and I, they will fight to honor the dignity of work.The President-elect and I share a vision of America where opportunity is within reach for all The People.Where everyone can see a brighter future for themselves and their children.With the leadership of these public servants and our entire economic team, we will get to work building that America less than two weeks from today.Thank you, Mr. President-elect."}
