HIS REMARKS ARE ABOUT 10 MINUTES. (music) HEY, FOLKS. HOW ARE YOU? GOD, I LOVE YOU. I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING MARK. HE CALLED AND ASKED IF I WOULD SPEAK. I AM GETTING SO SICK AND TIRED OF THE WAY EVERYBODY IS BEING TREATED, AMERICAN WORKERS, THAT I HAVE HAD IT UP TO HERE, LIKE A LOT OF YOU HADVE. I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS SHORT. THIS CROWD LOOKS LIKE MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD IN SCRANTON IN KLIMA. I REALLY MEAN , CLAYMONT. I REALLY MEAN IT. PEOPLE WHO PLAY BY THE RULES, PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO, AND PEOPLE WHO ARE ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT, DECENCY, FAIRNESS. MY DAD USED TO SAY A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK, IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU ARE TREATED, DECENCY, HONOR. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. I'M NOT JOKING ABOUT THIS. THIS IS NOT POLITICAL, THIS IS GOD'S TRUTH. MY DAD LEFT SCRANTON BECAUSE HE DID NOT HAVE WORK. EVERYBODY , EVERY TIME SOMEBODY LOST A JOB FROM WHERE WE LIVED, HE WOULD SAY THAT. IT'S ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. WORKERS ARE NOT BEING TREATED ACROSS THE BOARD WITH DIGNITY. THEY ARE NOT BEING TREATED LIKE A MATTER. WALL STREET BANKERS AND CEOS DID NOT BUILD AMERICA. YOU BOTH AMERICA , BUILT AMERICA. ORDINARY, MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE BUILT AMERICA. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THAT'S A FACT. THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS PLACE. YOU KNOW WHO BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS? UNION'S. NOT A JOKE. SOMETHING'S HAPPENING HERE, GUYS. THE REASON NOT ONLY WHY YOU BUSTING YOUR NECK AND WENT ON PICKET LINES AND STRIKES OVER THE YEARS TO GET BETTER RESULTS FOR YOU, YOU GOT BETTER RESULTS FOR EVERY WORKER IN AMERICA. THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON THERE'S A 40 HOUR WEEK, OVERTIME PAY, THAT THESE PROTECTIONS EXIST FOR ALL WORKERS AND IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU. FOR A WHILE, 11 OF , A LOT OF OTHER LABORERS NOT UNION FORGOTTEN. NOW THE WAY THEY ARE BEING TREATED BY CORPORATE AMERICA, THEY ARE GOING TO REMEMBER IT AGAIN. THAT'S WHY THEY ARE GOING TO SUPPORT YOU AND BOYCOTT THIS PLACE. THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE AND IT'S ABOUT TIME THEY CHANGE. EVERYBODY WHO WORKS LIKE HELL IN THIS COUNTRY, THE WAY WE WERE ALL RAISED, YOU WORK, PLAY BY THE RULES, AND YOU GET A SHOT, AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS IS NOT A NUMBER, THE MIDDLE CLASS IS A VALUE SET. ITS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO OWN YOUR OWN HOME AND NOT RUN IT, ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SEND YOUR KID TO A DECENT PARK WHERE YOU KNOW THEY WILL COME HOME SAFELY. SENDING THEM TO A SCHOOL BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. IT'S BEING ABLE TO TAKE HOME YOUR GERIATRIC MOM WHEN YOUR DAD PASSES AWAY AND HOPE YOUR KIDS NEVER HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. THAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE DECENT HEALTH CARE, A FAIR WAGE, A RETIREMENT. WITHOUT THOSE THINGS, YOU CANNOT LIVE A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT ABOUT THIS OUTFIT, AND THEY ARE NOT UNIQUE HERE. IT IS HAPPENING ALL OVER CORPORATE AMERICA. THESE GUYS MAKE $4 BILLION IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. THEY GET ALMOST $250 MILLION IN A TAX CUT WITH THAT SCAM THE PRESIDENT PUT THROUGH. WHAT DO THEY DO? THINK ABOUT THIS. WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY BOUGHT BACK $3 BILLION OF THEIR OWN STOCK. YOU KNOW WHY? THAT INCREASES THE VALUE OF THE STOCK THEY HAVE LEFT. THAT MEANS THE CEO GETS PAID A LOT MORE, THE WEALTHY GET PAID A LOT MORE, AND THE STOCK CARRIERS GET PAID A LOT MORE. IT USED TO BE THAT THE ONLY STAKEHOLDER IN CORPORATIONS WERE NOT JUST SHAREHOLDERS. I GOT A CARTOON IN MY OFFICE THAT I THINK YOU SAW IT, MARTY. EVERY TIME THE PRESIDENT CAME IN HE WOULD TURN IT AROUND. IT SAYS, THERE'S A PICTURE OF A NEW YORKER. IT'S A PICTURE OF A ROTUND GUY WITH A BLACK TURTLENECK, MASK, AND BERET. HE SITTING AT A TABLE BEING INTERROGATED. THERE IS A BIG BURLAP BACK ON THE TABLE WITH A MONEY SIGN ON IT. HE SAYS HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW HE WAS A JOB CREATOR? THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE JOB CREATORS STOCKHOLDERS. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? YOU MEAN TO TELL ME MY DAD DID NOT CREATE JOBS UP AND DOWN THE LINE? WE USED TO HAVE EVERYBODY WHO WAS IN ON THE DEAL. IT USED TO BE A BASIC BARGAIN THAT IF YOU CONTRIBUTED TO THE BENEFIT OF THE OUTFIT YOU WORK WITH, YOU GET TO SHARE IN THE BENEFITS. THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN ANYMORE. WAGES HAVE GONE UP VERY LITTLE, PRODUCTIVITY HAS GONE UP EXPONENTIALLY. WHERE ARE YOU SITTING? THE SAME PLACE AS BEFORE. WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. I REALLY MEAN IT. WOULD HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS , WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. THIS BARGAIN HAS BEEN BROKEN. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, WHAT THEY DO WITH THIS IS THEY GO BACK AND , HOW CAN THEY MAKE THAT MONEY, BUY BACK ALL THAT STOCK, AND TELL YOU THEY ARE GOING TO CUT YOUR WAGES? THEY ARE GOING TO CUT OVERTIME, YOUR MEDICAL CARE BENEFITS? I MEAN, HOW IN GOD'S NAME DOES THAT MUCH ANYTHING , MATCH ANYTHING? I'M A POLITICIAN, I GET IT. IT'S WAY BEYOND THAT, GUYS. THIS IS WAY BEYOND THAT. THIS IS WRONG. THIS IS MORE EARLY , MORALLY WRONG WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY. I'M SICK OF IT AND SO ARE YOU! [APPLAUSE] GUYS, LOOK, LOOK , [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE ARE IN A PLACE [AUDIO DROP] , WE GOT SOME PEOPLE WERE GOING TO PLAY JUST FAIR. THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST IS THINK ABOUT IT, THINK ABOUT HOW WE DO NOT TREAT HARD-WORKING AMERICAN, MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE WITH ANY DIGNITY. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. EVERY SINGLE PERSON DESERVES TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. THINK OF WHAT WE DO. WHEN THE GUY, AND I WAS JUST WITH THE ELECTORAL WORKERS. YOU KNOW, IF IN FACT THEY ARE CLIMBING UP PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF A STORM, , UP A PO LE IN THE MIDDLE OF A STORM, WHO SAYS THANK YOU TO THEM? IT'S ALL OF US, GUYS, TOO. WE HAVE TO START RECOGNIZING WHAT PEOPLE DO, BECAUSE IT MATTERS TO EVERYBODY. IN MATTERS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY FEEL RESPECTED. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THE WAY WE ARE NOT BEING TREATED. I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU, BECAUSE A LOT OF FOLKS ARE GOING TO SUPPORT YOU, A LOT OF FOLKS AROUND THE COUNTRY SUPPORTED YOU, BUT YOU HAVE TO ALSO SUPPORT THE REST OF THESE FOLKS DOING THE SAME THING. IF WE DO, WE WILL TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY. I MEAN IT. DON'T GIVE UP! KEEP IT GOING! WHEN JOB SHOULD BE ENOUGH. THANK YOU.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?459920-1\/joe-biden-stop-shop-strikers-massachusetts","Summary":"Former Vice President Joe Biden spoke at a rally in support of striking Stop and Shop workers.","Source":"459920-1","Type":"Speech"}
{"SpeechID":"CSPANJB29420191","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2019-04-29","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden Campaign Rally in Pittsburgh","RawText":"FOLLOWING HIS ONLINE ANNOUNCEMENT LAST WEEK ENTERING THE 2020 RACE, OR VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN HELD HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN EVENT AT A UNION HALL IN PITTSBURGH. HE RAISED $6.3 MILLION THE DAY AFTER HIS ANNOUNCED, AND HIS FIRST WEEK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WILL INCLUDE A TWO-DAY SWING THROUGH IOWA. GREAT TO SEE YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TO ALL OF MY SISTERS AND BROTHERS IN THE GREAT LABOR MOVEMENT AND , MOVEMENT IN PITTSBURGH AND BEYOND. TO THE MEMBERS OF THE IFF, THE PROUD GOLD AND BLACK. IT'S SO GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. AND IT'S ALSO SO MUCH OF A THRILL TO BE WITH THE HUNDREDS OF YOU IN THIS HALL. BUT THE OVERWHELMING CROWD THAT'S STILL OUTSIDE UNABLE TO GET IN, GOOD AFTERNOON TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NOW LET'S BE CLEAR WHY WE ARE HERE. AND IT'S REALLY SIMPLE. AND THAT'S TO ELECT JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THERE IS NO QUESTION, JOE IS THE ONE CANDIDATE IN 2020 WHO STANDS ABOVE THE REST WHEN IT COMES TO A CAREER STANDING UP TO PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR A LIVING AND HOLD A UNION CARD. HE UNDERSTANDS THE VALUE OF A HARD DAYS WORK AND THE DIGNITY OF GETTING YOUR HANDS DIRTY AND DOING A JOB YOU'RE PROUD OF. HE KNOWS LABOR AND UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS, THEY BUILT THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [WHISTLING] AND ALL OF YOU ARE PART OF WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING THIS GREAT COUNTRY. HE SPEAKS TO AND CONNECTS WITH THOSE WORKERS WHO DIDN'T BELIEVE THE LAST DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HEARD THEM, CARED ABOUT THEM AND FELT THAT THEIR HISTORIC VOTES FOR A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WERE MAYBE JUST BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED. I'M PRETTY STRAIGHT WHEN I SAY WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TO ALL OF YOU, AND THAT IS THAT I KNOW THAT JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO BE A PRESIDENT THAT WILL STAND UP FOR ALL OF THE PATRIOTIC AMERICANS WHO WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO EARN A DECENT WAGE, SEND YOUR KIDS TO COLLEGE, HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE AND ENJOY A DECENT AND SECURE RETIREMENT. DO YOU AGREE WITH ME? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JOE IS A LOT LIKE OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND A LOT LIKE SO MANY OF YOU. HE'S A PROBLEM SOLVER. HE'S ONE WHO'S DEDICATED TO MAKING THIS COUNTRY BETTER. THIS MORNING I HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF ANNOUNCING THAT THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIREFIGHTERS, THE IAFF, HAS ENDORSED JOE BIDEN TO BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND LET ME TELL YOU, WE ENDORSED HIM BECAUSE WE KNOW HE'LL BE A CHAMPION FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY IN AMERICA, FIGHTING FOR POLICIES AND LEGISLATION THAT IMPROVES THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF NOT JUST FIREFIGHTERS, BUT ALL OF YOU WHO WORK HARD FOR A LIVING. AND AT NOON TODAY, WE CELEBRATED AND HONORED WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED WHILE DOING THEIR JOBS, AND OUR MEMBERS WHO LOSE THEIR LIFE SACRIFICING IN THE LINE OF DUTY TO SERVE OTHERS. JOE BIDEN UNDERSTANDS THAT SACRIFICE. JOE BIDEN IS A COMPASSIONATE, PERSONAL, AND DECENT LEADER WHO WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH IS ALWAYS THERE WITH THOSE IN TIMES OF NEED. HE'S A GOOD MAN, CARES DEEPLY ABOUT HIS FELLOW AMERICANS AND OUR GREAT NATION. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND HE IS NOT ONLY FOCUSED ON MAKING A BETTER AMERICA FOR WORKING FAMILIES HIS , EXPERIENCE ON THE NATIONAL STAGE THROUGHOUT HIS PUBLIC CAREER, ESTABLISHING STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH LEADERS ACROSS THE GLOBE WILL RESTORE AMERICA AS THE BEACON OF HOPE AND DEMOCRACY AROUND THE WORLD, WHERE WE ONCE WERE AND WHERE WE WILL BE AGAIN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND AT A TIME WHEN THE POLITICAL ARENA HAS BECOME SO DAMN NASTY, SO MUCH RANCOR AND PERSONAL ATTACKS, JOE WILL BRING CIVILITY AND DECENCY AND ENHANCE THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE THAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE HE'S JUST LIKE ALL OF YOU HERE, HE TRULY BELIEVES WE MUST BE UNIFIED AND STRAND TOGETHER AS AMERICANS. HIS YEARS IN THE U.S. SENATE AS , SENATE, AS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, BRINGS THE EXPERIENCE THAT IS NEEDED TO GET THINGS DONE. AND WHILE WE CAN DEBATE AND ARGUE OVER POLICY ISSUES, WE MUST PUT PERSONAL DIFFERENCES ASIDE TO SOLVE THE BIG PROBLEMS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND JOE BIDEN WILL HELP US DO JUST THAT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OK, AND DO WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO RECOGNIZES A STRONG ECONOMY ISN'T JUST GDP, NOT JUST STOCK MARKET INDEX INCREASES, NOT JUST LINES ON A GRAPH, BUT A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES A STRONG ECONOMY HAS TO WORK FOR A WORKING PEOPLE. IS THAT A PRESIDENT WE WANT? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LISTEN, THOSE GREAT JOBLESS NUMBERS WE'RE HEARING ABOUT, TO MY BELIEF, IS SOMEWHAT MISLEADING, PARTICULARLY IF THEY'RE MADE UP BY HOW MANY OF YOU WHOSE FAMILIES HAVE BOTH PEOPLE AND THAT FAMILY WORKING. HOW MANY ARE WORKING PART TIME? HOW MANY ARE NOT GETTING PAID A DECENT, FAIR LIVING WAGE? HOW MANY ARE WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET? WE NEED TO FIX THAT. SO DO WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL FIX THAT? THAT WAS A YES. DO WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET PAID A FAIR DAY'S WAGE FOR A FAIR DAY'S WORK, TO HAVE A LITTLE SOMETHING TO SAVE AFTER YOU PAY YOUR BILLS TO HELP ENSURE YOUR CHILDREN WILL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE THAN YOU DID, MAN WE DID? LET ME HEAR YOU. I CAN'T HEAR YOU. LET THEM HEAR YOU OUTSIDE. FAR TOO MANY , LISTEN, THIS IS UNION TOWN. THIS IS UNION STATE. THIS IS UNION COUNTY. AND FAR TOO MANY POLITICIANS TODAY TREAT THE WORD UNION LIKE IT'S A DIRTY WORD. BUT I TRULY BELIEVE OUR NATION IS SEEING ONCE AGAIN THE REAL VALUE OF OUR UNIONS, THE REAL VALUE OF YOUR WORK, THE HISTORY OF HOW UNIONS BUILT AMERICA, THAT UNIONS DID BUILD A MIDDLE CLASS, THAT UNIONS ARE FIGHTING FOR A FAIR WORK FORCE, THAT UNIONS CAN PROVIDE A VOICE OF PROTECTION FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO BUSTS THEIR ASS EVERY DAY TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY STRONGER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND JOE BIDEN ISN'T AFRAID TO SAY UNION. JOE BIDEN HAS STOOD WITH UNIONS , AND JOE BIDEN WILL SUPPORT OUR UNIONS BECAUSE HE KNOWS YOU ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS AND THE FOUNDATION OF OUR STRONG NATION. ARE YOU READY TO STAND WITH HIM? AND FINALLY, WITH A FIELD OF GOOD PEOPLE PUTTING THEMSELVES FORWARD IN THIS PRIMARY SEASON, THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR WE MUST DETERMINE IN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION PROCESS IS WHO CAN WIN. WHO HAS THE NECESSARY EXPERIENCE TO WIN? WHO'S GOT THE METTLE TO WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION? AND LET ME SHOOT STRAIGHT WITH YOU, AND THIS MAY NOT BE POPULAR IN PARTS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A NOMINEE AND CAN'T HAVE A NOMINEE THAT IS TOO FAR LEFT. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. A CANDIDATE THAT HAS HIGH-MINDED IDEALS, MAYBE HONORABLE IDEALS , BUT LITTLE CHANCE OF WINNING. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN WIN, THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN AND WILL BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT IS JOE BIDEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED JOE. WE NEED JOE. SO THAT'S WHY THIS IAFF, AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO COUNT ON EVERY ONE OF YOU TO WORK YOUR ASSES OFF TO ELECT OUR FRIEND, JOE BIDEN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS ALL HARDWORKING UNION MEMBERS ALL ACROSS THIS GREAT COUNTRY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THIS IS SO EXCITING TO BE HERE TODAY IN PITTSBURGH! YOU KNOW, SOME WEEKS ARE JUST A BIT MORE EXCITING THAN OTHERS, AND THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE WEEK FOR JOE AND ME. DR. BARTON:IDEN: AS YOU KNOW, LAST THURSDAY MY HUSBAND ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND WHAT DID I DO TO CELEBRATE? THE SAME THING THAT ALL OF YOU PROBABLY DID, I WENT TO WORK. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE, HEY, THOSE RESEARCH PAPERS , WEREN'T GOING TO GET COLLECTED BY THEMSELVES. SO TEACHING , THANK YOU. TEACHING IS MORE THAN JUST A JOB FOR ME. IT'S A CALLING. AND CAN I ASK HOW MANY TEACHERS ARE IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY? [CHEERING] THANK YOU. I CAN SEE BY YOUR SHIRTS. NOW THAT I SEE YOU. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. I KNOW A LOT OF YOU TEACHERS FEEL THE SAME WAY. OUR STUDENTS GIVE US SO MUCH. THEY KEEP US GROUNDED AND INSPIRE US. MOST OF MY STUDENTS AT NORTHERN VIRGINIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE ARE THE FIRST ONES IN THEIR FAMILY TO PURSUE AN EDUCATION. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THEY WORK FULL-TIME JOBS AND HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE COUNTING ON THEM. THEY COME TO MY CLASS AFTER THEIR MILITARY SERVICE IN IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN. THEY COME AS SINGLE PARENTS OR SOME ARE WOMEN RETURNING TO SCHOOL TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES, THEY COME LOOKING FOR THE SAME SIMPLE THING, THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK HARD AND BUILD A FUTURE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT, ISN'T IT? WHEN WE TURN ON THE NEWS TODAY, WE ARE TOLD THAT WE ARE A NATION THAT IS MORE DIVIDED THAN EVER. WE'RE TOLD THAT OUR DIFFERENCES ARE IRRECONCILABLE. THAT WE MUST CLOSE THE DOOR ON PEOPLE WHO THINK DIFFERENTLY. WE'RE TOLD THAT THERE IS A WAR BETWEEN THEM AND US. BUT WHEN I TRAVEL THIS COUNTRY AND I MEET PEOPLE LIKE ALL OF YOU, THAT'S NOT WHAT I SEE. I SEE NEIGHBORS WHO PICK UP GROCERIES FOR THE MOM WHOSE HUSBAND IS DEPLOYED. I SEE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHO ARE GIVING RECORD-BREAKING AMOUNTS OF DONATIONS TO CAUSES THAT THEY CARE ABOUT. I SEE AMERICANS WHO DRIVE THEIR PICKUP TRUCKS INTO THE FLOODS OF A HURRICANE AND RUN TOWARDS FIRES TO HELP THEIR NEIGHBORS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHO WE ARE. THAT'S THE AMERICA I KNOW AND LOVE. THAT'S WHAT THIS NATION IS ABOUT. WORKING HARD AND BUILDING A BETTER LIFE FOR OUR KIDS. COMING TOGETHER TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT IS MORE POWERFUL THAN ANYTHING WE COULD ACHIEVE ALONE. WE ARE A NATION OF FAITH. THE BELIEF THAT TOGETHER WE CAN RISE TO OUR GREATEST ASPIRATIONS AND THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE YET TO COME. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT FAITH HAS SHAPED MY HUSBAND'S LIFE. IT HAS LED HIM THROUGH TRAGEDY AND TRIUMPH, THROUGH HIS TIME IN THE SENATE AND THROUGH EIGHT INCREDIBLE HOPEFUL YEARS AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND THAT'S WHY I KNOW THAT WITH YOUR HELP, HE WILL BRING THAT HOPE, THAT VISION, THAT FAITH IN THE PROMISE OF AMERICA TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERING AND RONISE SERMONS AND I LOVE TEACHING. SHE IS A MIDDLE SCHOOL MATH TEACHER WHO HAS SERVED IN SOME OF PITTSBURGH'S MOST CHALLENGING SCHOOLS. SHE IS A PROUD MEMBER OF THE PITTSBURGH FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND WAS RECENTLY APPOINTED TO THE EXECUTIVE BOARD. SHE'S A MOM OF FIVE CHILDREN AND A SURROGATE MOM TO MANY OF HER STUDENTS AND HER COLLEAGUES ALIKE. SHE'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS WELL LOVED AND A FIRECRACKER. SO YOU KNOW SHE AND JOE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON. [LAUGHTER] HELLO, EVERYONE! I WOULD LIKE TO THANK DR. BIDEN FOR THAT WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION AND FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO INDUCE , INTRODUCE, EXCUSE ME, OUR SPECIAL GUEST. FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE OF MYSELF WITH YOU ALL. I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN PITTSBURGH TO A YOUNG COUPLE WITH THE AMERICAN DREAM, TO PROVIDE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR CHILD THAN THEY HAD. MY MOTHER WAS A NURSE'S ASSISTANT FOR OVER 25 YEARS AND MY FATHER IS A RECENTLY RETIRED UNION PAINTER, OVER 49 YEARS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [RONISE CHUCKLES] THE REASON I SPEAK OF THE WORK THEY DID IS BECAUSE THEY WERE HARD-WORKING, MIDDLE CLASS AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO GREW UP WITH LOW INCOME AND LITTLE MONEY. THEY BOTH SHOWED AND INSTILLED IN ME THAT HARD WORK PAYS OFF AND THAT KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I WAS RAISED ON THAT PROVERB, \"IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD,\" TO RESPECT MY ELDERS, TO BE HONORABLE, WORK HARD AND TAKE PRIDE IN EVERY JOB I HAD, BECOME A PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN IN THE WORLD AND TO ALWAYS HONOR GOD. I WENT TO PITTSBURGH PUBLIC SCHOOLS, WHERE I NOW TEACH TODAY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I KNOW THAT MY TASK AS A TEACHER AND A MOTHER IS THAT I AM NOT RAISING CHILDREN BUT FUTURE ADULTS. TODAY I AM HONORED TO STAND BEFORE YOU AS SOMEONE WHO WAS OFTEN TOLD WHAT I COULDN'T BE, I WAS LOOKED DOWN, COUNTED OUT AND EVEN THROWN AWAY BY MANY, BUT MY FAMILY AND THE TEACHERS WHO PUSHED ME WHEN I WANTED TO QUIT IS WHY I AM STANDING HERE TODAY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I ENCOURAGE MY CHILDREN TO BE BETTER THAN ME AND SOAR HIGHER THAN ME. I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT IN LIFE , IT'S NOT HOW YOU START BUT HOW YOU FINISH. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL BRING BACK THE WORDS OF THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS, ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NOT , NOT FOR ALL WHO ARE IN A CERTAIN CLASS OR RACE, BUT FOR ALL PEOPLE, REGARDLESS OF RACE, CLASS OR GENDER. WE MUST HAVE A LEADER THAT HAS A VISION, EXPERIENCE AND INTEGRITY. WE MUST HAVE A LEADER THAT IS HONORABLE AND WILL SPEAK TO WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG AND STAND FIRM ON THE TRUTH. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LAYING ASIDE PRIDE, LAYING ASIDE PRIDE AND SELF-ELEVATION, BUT SERVING THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WILLING TO DO THE WORK NECESSARY TO REGAIN THE TRUST OF ALL AMERICANS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE MUST COME TOGETHER AND BUILD EACH OTHER UP AND NOT TEAR EACH OTHER DOWN. NO LONGER CREATING DIVISION WITH HATRED AND FEAR. I BELIEVE THAT JOE BIDEN IS THAT PERSON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN IS FROM PENNSYLVANIA AND COMES FROM A WORKING CLASS FAMILY. HE WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HE IS HISTORY. HE STILL HAS WORK TO DO AND BUILD ON THE WORK THAT HE AND PRESIDENT OBAMA BEGAN. IT IS MY HONOR AND PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S HOW I'M KNOWN BACK HOME. THAT'S HOW I'M KNOWN MOST PLACES. THANK YOU. BEFORE I BEGIN, I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT, QUITE FRIENDLY, TO REFLECT ON SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED HERE IN THE STATE NOT LONG AGO. AS A MATTER OF FACT, VERY RECENTLY. REFLECT ON THE ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACK THAT TOOK PLACE THIS WEEKEND IN POWAY SYNAGOGUE IN CALIFORNIA. ONE DEAD, THREE INJURED. BUT, FOLKS, WE SAW HATE IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WE SAW IT AGAIN IN PITTSBURGH AT THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE IN THE ATTACK OF THE DEADLIEST IN AMERICAN HISTORY ON A JEWISH COMMUNITY. AND WE'RE REMINDED AGAIN THAT WE ARE IN A BATTLE. WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR AMERICA'S SOUL. SO, FOLKS, I WANT TO THANK RICH FITZGERALD, THE COUNTY EXECUTIVE, FOR BEING HERE AND MAYOR NEZBY, CITY OF DUCANE IS HERE AS WELL. YOU ARE HERE SOMEWHERE. [APPLAUSE] INTERNATIONAL FIREFIGHTERS GENERAL PRESIDENT AND MY FRIEND FOR A LONG, LONG TIME, ONE OF THE GUYS IN THE UNION, AS THEY SAY ALONG WITH THE TEACHERS, BROUGHT ME TO THE DANCE WHEN I STARTED. THANK YOU, HAROLD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENDORSEMENT. AND KEVIN SCHMITT, PRESIDENT OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL HERE. THANKS FOR THE USE OF THE HOUSE. I APPRECIATE IT, THE HELP. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE FIREFIGHTERS, DAVE WHERE ARE YOU? THE PENNSYLVANIA FIREFIGHTERS. DAVE , THERE YOU ARE. PASSED RIGHT BY YOU. DAVE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND ALSO, A REAL , A UNION THAT HELPED ME IN THE VERY, VERY BEGINNING OF MY CAREER AND I'VE HAD GREAT RESPECT FOR, THE UNITED STEEL WORKERS. BOBBY MACK. BOBBY MACK, PRESIDENT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND THE BUILDING TRADES. FRANK. FRANK'S HERE, TOO. SO, LOOK , YOU GOT IT, PAL. LOOK, I , THE PENNSYLVANIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFGE. THE UNITED BROTHERHOOD OF THE CARPENTERS, SERVICE EMPLOYEES UNION, SEIU, UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS. BY THE WAY, I MAKE NO APOLOGIES. I AM A UNION MAN. PERIOD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. LET ME TELL YOU WHY , THANK YOU. LET ME TELL YOU WHY I CHOSE PITTSBURGH TO BEGIN THIS EFFORT. I BELIEVE THAT PITTSBURGH AND MY NATIVE TOWN OF SCRANTON AND MY HOMETOWN OF WILMINGTON AND CLAYMONT REPRESENT THE CITIES AND TOWNS THAT MAKE UP HARDWORKING, MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS WHO ARE THE BACKBONE OF THIS NATION. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THE BACKBONE OF THE NATION. I ALSO CAME HERE BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY, FOLKS, IF I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP IN 2020, IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. WITH YOUR HELP, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE TABLE TO DO THAT. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT IN PENNSYLVANIA. WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. NORTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA. PLACES WHERE A LITTLE LATELY WE'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A STRUGGLE. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, I THINK WE ARE COMING BACK. SO PLEASE, PLEASE GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM AND SIGN UP AND JOIN OUR CAMPAIGN. WE NEED YOUR HELP. WE NEED YOUR HELP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THERE ARE THREE BASIC REASONS I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE FIRST IS TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THE NATION. THE SECOND IS TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS NATION. AND THE THIRD SO TO UNIFY THIS NATION. WE ALWAYS DO BETTER WHEN WE ACT AS ONE AMERICA. TODAY I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE SECOND OF THESE THREE AND THAT'S REBUILDING THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA. THAT IS, WE HAVE TIME, ALL MY TIME IN PUBLIC LIFE I'VE GOTTEN INVOLVED, I'VE BEEN REFERRED TO AS MIDDLE CLASS JOE. IT'S NOT ALWAYS MEANT AS A COMPLIMENT. IT'S USUALLY THAT I'M NOT SOPHISTICATED, THAT'S WHY I'M MIDDLE CLASS JOE. THE FACT IS I'M SOPHISTICATED ABOUT WHY, HOW, AND WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY. LET ME SAY THIS SIMPLY AND CLEARLY, AND I MEAN THIS, THE COUNTRY WASN'T BUILT BY WALL STREET BANKERS, C.E.O.'S AND HEDGE FUND MANAGERS. IT WAS BUILT BY YOU. IT WAS BUILT BY THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS IS BUILT BY UNIONS. BY YOU. LOOK, FOLKS. YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE STORY OF AMERICA. WHEN ORDINARY PEOPLE FROM NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE YOURS AND MINE, WE GREW UP, GO OUT AND DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS, THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENS. WHEN I LOOK OUT AT THIS CROWD, I SEE THE FOLKS FROM MY NEIGHBORHOOD IN CLAYMONT AND WILMINGTON AND SCRANTON. AND I AM NOT BEING SOLICITOUS, I MEAN IT. I SEE PEOPLE WITH PHYSICAL COURAGE AND BRAINS. I SEE PEOPLE WHO'VE BUSTED THEIR BACKS THEIR WHOLE LIVES TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. I SEE PEOPLE LIKE THE MILLIONS ACROSS THIS NATION WHO GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY TO WORK LIKE A DEVIL TO RAISE THEIR FAMILY, PAY THEIR TAXES AND VOLUNTEER IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY WORK. I SEE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT BEING MIDDLE CLASS IS NOT A NUMBER. IT'S A VALUE SET. IT'S BEING ABLE TO SEND YOUR KIDS TO A PARK WHERE YOU KNOW THEY'RE SAFE. BEING ABLE TO OWN YOUR OWN HOME AND NOT JUST HAVE TO RENT IT. IT'S BEING ABLE TO SEND YOUR KID TO A GOOD SCHOOL AND IF THEY DO WELL THEY CAN GO BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. TO TRADE SCHOOL OR COLLEGE OR BEYOND. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR GERIATRIC MOM WHEN YOU'RE DAD PASSES, AND NOT WORRY THAT YOUR CHILDREN WILL HAVE TO TAKE CARE FOR OF YOU AND PLAN FOR A SOLID RETIREMENT. THAT'S NOT ASKING A LOT. [CHANTING] EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. THE METACLASSES HURTING. IT'S HURTING NOW. PEOPLE IN AMERICA DON'T THINK THE CHILDREN IN AMERICA WILL HAVE THE SAME STANDARD OF LIVING AS THEY HAD. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT'S HAPPENED IN A LONG, LONG, LONG TIME. THE STOCK MARKET IS ROARING. BUT YOU DON'T FEEL IT. THERE'S $2 TRILLION TAX CUT LAST YEAR. DID YOU FEEL IT? DID YOU GET ANYTHING FROM IT? [CROWD GRUMBLES] OF COURSE NOT. OF COURSE NOT. ALL IT WENT TO THE FOLKS AT THE TOP AND CORPORATIONS THAT PAY NO TAXES. THE NUMBER OF CORPORATIONS THAT PAY NO TAXES NOW HAS DOUBLED SINCE THAT. LOOK, GUYS, THIS IS NOT GOOD. WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE HAS HAPPENED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS. BUT FOR ME, ONE OF THEM STANDS OUT. THE BASIC BARGAIN USED TO EXIST. THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS USED TO AGREE TO HAS BEEN BROKEN. AND THAT IS YOU CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELFARE OF THE ENTERPRISE YOU WORK FOR, YOU GOT TO SHARE IN THE BENEFITS AND THE PROFITS. IF THE ENTERPRISE HITS HARD TIMES, EVERYBODY TOOK A HIT. UP AND DOWN THE LINE. FROM THE SECRETARY TO THE C.E.O. BUT THAT BARGAIN'S BEEN BROKEN. NOW THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO BENEFIT WHEN A COMPANY DOES WELL ARE THE C.E.O.'S AND THE SHAREHOLDERS. AND THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP. NOW, PEOPLE GET HURT WHEN A COMPANY GETS HIT HARD TIMES. THERE ARE THE WORKERS. IT'S A ONE-WAY STREET THESE DAYS. JUST LOOK AROUND. G.M. I WORKED LIKE THE DEVIL TO SEE TO IT THAT G.M. STAYED ALIVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. UNION WORKERS, THE U.A.W. TOOK INCREDIBLE CUTS IN THEIR FUTURE AND THEIR PENSIONS TO GET G.M. WORKING, TO KEEP IT ALIVE. THE TAXPAYERS BAILED THEM OUT. THEY PAID IT BACK AND PAID IT BACK WITH INTEREST. BUT WHAT HAPPENED? THE C.E.O.'S AND THE EXECUTIVES DID QUITE WELL. AND THE SECOND THEY HIT HARD TIMES, WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY CLOSED PLANTS. THEY ANNOUNCED THEY'RE GOING TO LAY OFF OR TRANSFER 14,000 WORKERS. THEY ALSO GOT THAT LAST YEAR, OVER IN TAX BREAKS. $192 MILLION THEY COULD HAVE GIVEN EVERY ONE THEY LAID OFF SEVERANCE PAY IF THEY HAD TO. COULD HAVE GIVEN EVERYONE. THEY DID NOTHING. THEY BOUGHT BACK THEIR STOCK. RAISED THEIR BENEFITS. RAISED THEIR SALARIES. ANNOUNCED THEY WERE GOING BUILD A NEW TRUCK IN MEXICO. [CROWD BOOING] JOE: FOLKS, FOLKS, NO. LOOK. I JUST DID A RALLY FOR WORKERS IN BOSTON. 31,000 WORKERS WENT ON STRIKE TO PROTECT THEIR WAGES, HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS. WAS STOP N' SHOP IN TROUBLE? NO, THEIR PARENT COMPANY HAD MADE $2 BILLION THE YEAR BEFORE. $2 BILLION. IT'S WHAT THEY DO. THEY WERE GOING TO DECIDE, NOTWITHSTANDING THAT, THEY'RE GOING TO BUY BACK THEIR STOCK AND TRY TO CUT WAGES OR FREEZE WAGES FOR THEIR PEOPLE. IT'S NOT RIGHT. NOW HERE, UPMC, UPMC, ONE OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE. [CROWD BOOING] NO. BUT I THINK PEOPLE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS. YOU UNDERSTAND IT. THE SCIU IS ENGAGED IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ORGANIZING FIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY. FOLKS, 200 YEARS AGO IN STEEL MILLS AND COAL MINES IS TRUE TODAY. , WHAT WAS TRUE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN STEEL MILLS AND COAL MINES IS TRUE TODAY. OUR BIG HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING IN OUR BIG HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A STRONG UNION TO GET JUSTICE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. STOP THE UNION BUSTING, STOP. [APPLAUSE] STOP TRYING TO KEEP YOUR WORKERS FROM ORGANIZING. I WANT YOU TO KNOW, UMPC WORKERS, I HAVE YOUR BACK, AND FIAMMA PRESIDENT, I WILL FIGHT LIKE THE DESK TOIL MAKE SURE YOU , FIGHT LIKE OF A DEVIL TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT BLOCKED, UNIONS ARE NOT BLOCKED UNFAIRLY BY THIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S ECONOMICALLY WRONG. AND IT'S MORALLY WRONG. SO WHAT DO WE DO? FOLKS, I THINK WE HAVE TO RETHINK HOW WE DEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES A SUCCESSFUL ECONOMY. IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR THE STOCK MARKET TO RISE. LET'S NOT A BAD THING. BUT IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH. , THAT'S NOT A BAD THING. BUT IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH. WORKERS FEEL POWERLESS. TOO OFTEN HUMILIATED. I CALL IT AN ABUSE OF POWER. AND I CAN'T STAND IT. NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WORK, I THINK ABOUT DIGNITY. I THINK ABOUT A LOT ABOUT MY DAD. A PROUD GENTLEMAN. MY DAD HAD AN EXPRESSION. HE SAID, JOEY, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT YOUR KID AND SAY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK AND MEAN IT. BUT, FOLKS, TOO MANY PEOPLE, THEY CAN'T LOOK AT THEIR KIDS TODAY. AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE OK. AND MEAN IT. THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO CHANGE. I THINK ABOUT SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY TODAY. WHO ARE JUST NOT GETTING RESPECT, NOT TREATED WITH RESPECT. HOW DO YOU GET TO A PLACE, HOW DID WE EVER GET HERE, WHERE PEOPLE WHO TEACH OUR KIDS, TAKE CARE OF OUR SICK, TRANSPORT OUR GOODS, BUILD OUR BRIDGES AND REPAIR OUR ROOFS, KEEP OUR WATER SYSTEMS SAFE? PEOPLE WHO RACE INTO BURNING BUILDINGS, PEOPLE WHO RACE INTO DANGER TO PROTECT US, PEOPLE WHO PICK UP OUR GARBAGE OFF OUR STREETS, IRON WORKERS, STEEL WORKERS, BOILERMAKERS, PLUMBERS, ELECTRICAL WORKERS, SALES PEOPLE, HOW DID WE GET TO THIS PLACE WHERE THEY DON'T THINK WE SEE THEM OR HEAR THEM OR KNOW THEM? AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, RESPECT THEM? RESPECT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS , I THINK THE QUESTION TODAY IS, HOW DID WE GET HERE, HOW DID IT HAPPEN, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? ALL ACROSS AMERICA, COMMUNITIES ARE HURTING. WITH TOO MANY PEOPLE LEFT OUT OR LEFT BEHIND. OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM IS BROKEN. WE'RE TEARING AMERICA APART INSTEAD OF LIFTING IT UP. AND THE MAJOR, IN MY VIEW, THE MAJOR MORAL OBLIGATION OF OUR TIME IS TO RESTORE, REBUILD AND RESPECT THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA. THE MIDDLE CLASS. AS WE REBUILD IT, WE NEED THIS REBUILDING TO BE ALL INCLUSIVE. OPENING THE DOORS TO OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS. NO MATTER THEIR RACE, THEIR GENDER, WHO THEY LOVE, NO MATTER WHO OR WHERE THEY'RE FROM. NO MATTER WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE A DISABILITY. ALL AMERICA HAS TO BE INCLUDED AS WE REBUILD. ALL AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I GUARANTEE YOU, THIS IS, REMAINS AND WILL BE MY MEASURE OF A CONSTITUTE THE SECOND I'M IN SUCCESS. THE DIGNITY OF WORK IS MY MEASURE. WHICH IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE SECURITY AND SHARE THE JOY WITH YOUR FAMILIES. HOW CAN A PERSON'S DIGNITY BE MAINTAINED IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO CARE FOR THEIR SICK CHILD OR FAMILY MEMBER, BECAUSE OF A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION? OR BECAUSE THEY'VE REACHED A POINT WHERE THEIR HEALTH CARE HAS RUN OUT AND INSURANCE COMPANY SAYS NO MORE? JILL AND I, MY FAMILY, LIKE MANY OF YOU, WENT THROUGH A YEAR KNOWING OUR SON WAS TERMINALLY ILL. I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF WE WERE TOLD THAT HE'S RUN OUT OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN HIS INSURANCE POLICY AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT HIM OFF FROM THE PALLIATIVE CARE HE WAS GETTING. MY LORD. THINK ABOUT IT. HOW CAN A PARENT MAINTAIN THE DIGNITY, THEIR DIGNITY, IF THEIR CHILD WANTS TO GO BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL, TRADE SCHOOL, COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR COLLEGE AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT? HOW DO YOU GET THEM THERE? FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST THAT THAT CHILD IS NOT GOING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO GROW AND BE BETTER. BUT THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT IT. I'LL NEVER FORGET THE DAY MY SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL, GOING DOWN TO MY DAD'S OFFICE TO BORROW A CAR FOR THE PROM. DRIVING DOWN AN OLD CAR TO PICK UP A CAR FOR THE SENIOR PROM. I ASKED THE SECRETARY WHERE HE WAS. SHE SAID, HE IS OUT IN THE ALLEY BEHIND THE OFFICE. I WALKED OUT, MY DAD GENTLE, , A DECENT MAN, WAS PACING BACK AND FORTH. THIS IS A TRUE STORY. I WALKED IN, HE SAID, JOEY, I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY. I THOUGHT, MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED? DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO MOM OR MY BROTHERS OR SISTERS? BEFORE CELL PHONES. I SAID, WHAT'S THE MATTER, DAD? HE SAID, I WENT TO THE BANK TODAY TO TRY TO BORROW THE MONEY TO HELP YOU GET TO SCHOOL. BUT THEY WON'T LEND IT TO ME. I'M SO ASHAMED. HOW MANY PEOPLE IN AMERICA TODAY ARE IN THAT SITUATION? HARDWORKING, DECENT PEOPLE , BECAUSE THE COST OF EDUCATION HAS SKYROCKETTED SO BADLY AND ACCESS IS TO DIFFICULT? FOLKS COME DIGNITY. A MODEL CAN'T , IMMANUEL KANT, A PHILOSOPHER, SAID DIGNITY, THE DEFINITION OF DIGNITY IS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NEVER BE TREATED AS A MEANS TO AN END, BUT AN END IN THEMSELVES. THAT'S HOW TODAY'S CORPORATE CULTURE WORKS. C.E.O.'S AND THIS ADMINISTRATION SEE IT A DIFFERENT WAY. THEY SEE WORKERS AS A MEANS TO AN END. NOT THE END IN THEMSELVES. LOOK AT THE RECORD. THEY TREAT THEIR EMPLOYEES IN A WAY THAT IT IS ONLY ABOUT HOW CAN THEY MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFIT? NOT HOW CAN THEY MAXIMIZE THE CIRCUMSTANCE FOR THE EMPLOYEES WHO HELP THEM BUILD THE OPERATION. THEY'RE SQUEEZING THE LIFE OUT OF WORKERS. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK UNDER THE HOOD OF A LABOR MARKET, YOU SEE HOW TOUGH IT IS FOR WORKERS TO NEGOTIATE. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU UNION FOLKS THAT. YOU SEE HOW COMPANIES HAVE BECOME SO ADEPT AT SQUEEZING EVERY LAST PENNY OUT OF THEIR PAYROLL. HOW GOOD THEY'VE BECOME AT TILTING THE SCALES IN THEIR FAVOR. BUT IT IS NOT ONLY MAKING IT HARDER AND HARDER TO MEET OUR BASIC NEEDS, THEY'RE DOING IT ACROSS THE BOARD. NOT ONLY STRIPPING AWAY UNIONS' RIGHTS TO NEGOTIATE, BUT YOUR PERSONAL DAY. JUST TAKE A LOOK. THEY'RE NOT ONLY GOING AFTER LABOR AND UNIONS TO TRY TO TAKE AWAY AND DIMINISH THE RIGHT TO BARGAIN, THEY'RE GOING AFTER INDIVIDUALS. ALL TO SUPPRESS THEIR WAKES. WHY ON EARTH WOULD AN HOURLY WORKER MAKING SANDWICHES HAVE TO SIGN A NONCOMPETE CLAUSE? PROMISE, I WILL NOT COMPETE WITH THIS , BECAUSE , AND I KNOW WE LAUGH ABOUT IT. BUT HERE'S THE DEAL, GUYS. THEY CAN'T GO ACROSS TOWN TO ANOTHER SANDWICH PLACE AND GET A 15-CENT RAISE IF THEY COULD. THEY CAN'T EVEN ADVERTISE THEMSELVES. THEY CAN'T MOVE, BECAUSE WHY? ALL TO SUPPRESS WAGES. ALL TO SUPPRESS WAGES. I'VE SEEN THESE AGREEMENTS AT LEAST ONCE DURING THE CAREER. 40% OF THEM. IT'S WRONG. IT'S IMMORAL. AND IT SHOULD BE MADE ILLEGAL IN THE STATES WHERE THEY TRY TO DO IT. [APPLAUSE] BUT THEY DO THE SAME THING. WITH OCCUPATIONAL LICENSES. WHY SHOULD SOMEONE WHO BRAIDS HAIR HAVE TO GET 600 HOURS OF TRAINING? IT MAKES NO SENSE. IT'S DESIGNED TO KEEP THE COMPETITION DOWN. LOOK, FOLKS. YOU CAN'T JUST TRANSFER YOUR LICENSES ACROSS ONE STATE TO ANOTHER. THEY'RE MAKING IT HARDER AND HARDER. IN A WHOLE RANGE OF PROFESSIONS. ALL TO KEEP COMPETITION DOWN. WHY SHOULD WE GET RID OF THESE UNNECESSARY HOOPS OUT THERE? BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RESTORE AMERICA'S ABILITY AND INDIVIDUAL AMERICANS TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN DIGNITY. YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD STOP COMPANIES FROM CLASSIFYING LOW-WAGE WORKERS AS MANAGERS. YOU SEE IT ALL THE TIME THE WE TRIED IT IN OUR ADMINISTRATION. WHY DO THEY DO THAT? SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY OVERTIME. IT COST MORE THAN FOUR MILLION WORKERS LAST YEAR $1.2 BILLION IN LOST OVERTIME PAY. RECLASSIFICATION. BY THE WAY, SPEAKING OF OVERTIME, IT'S WELL PAST TIME THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE, NATIONALLY BE A MINIMUM OF $15. , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S TIME TO START REWARDING WORK OVER WEALTH. THE FIRST STEP IS REVERSE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TAX CUT FOR THE VERY WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS. WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THESE SPECIAL TAX BREAKS IN THE TAX CODE. THAT REWARD SPECIAL INTERESTS. LET'S GET RID OF CAPITAL GAIN LOOPHOLES FOR MULTIMILLIONAIRES. WARREN BUFFETT SAID IT BEST, HE SHOULDN'T PAY A LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY DOES. THAT'S BECAUSE OF CAPITAL GAINS. IT'S WRONG. [APPLAUSE] IT IS WRONG! AND I AM GOING TO CHANGE THAT, SO MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES DON'T PAY LOWER TAXES THAN FIREFIGHTERS, TEACHERS AND I GO ON AND ON. WE NEED TO REWARD WORK IN THIS COUNTRY. NOT JUST WEALTH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOOK! THERE IS MUCH MORE WE NEED! THERE'S MUCH MORE WE NEED TO DO TO BUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. IN THE COMING WEEKS, I AM GOING TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT THIS. IT STARTS WITH ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE EDUCATION. SO THAT EVERYONE CAN GET THE SKILLS THEY NEED. [APPLAUSE] 12 YEARS OF EDUCATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY IS NOT ENOUGH. SIMPLE. THERE'S GOT TO BE AFFORDABLE. 65 OUT OF 100 JOBS TODAY REQUIRE TRAINING BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. 65 OUT OF EVERY 100. BUT, BOY, WE HAVE TO MAKE IT , MAKE A POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION, MAKE TRAINING AFFORDABLE, MAKE SURE AN ECONOMY WORKS. NOT JUST FOR THE WEALTHY FOLKS, NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO GET FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE DEGREES, BUT THOSE WHO COMPETE FOR JOB TRAINING AND TRADES AND PROGRAMS. LOOK, GUYS. WE CAN DO ALL THIS. IT MEANS BEING ABLE TO HAVE A QUALITY HEALTH CARE. CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS. AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE WAS A HUGE STEP FORWARD. THE A.C.A. IN OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE MADE HISTORIC PROGRESS. BY EXTENDING HEALTH CARE TO 22 MILLION PEOPLE. AMERICANS WHO DIDN'T HAVE IT BEFORE NOW HAVE IT. 22 MILLION. WE HAVE TO STOP THIS ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORT TO GUT IT FIRST, AND THEN COMMAND WE HAVE TO MOVE ON AND FINISH THE JOB, AND MAKE HEALTH CARE A RIGHT! HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT. NOT A PRIVILEGE. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE TO GIVE EVERYBODY THE PEACE OF MIND THEY DESERVE. WHEN YOU'RE COVERING IT THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER OR ON YOUR OWN OR NOT, YOU ALL SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE TO BE ABLE TO BUY INTO A PUBLIC OPTION PLAN FOR MEDICARE. YOUR CHOICE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF THE INSURANCE COMPANY DOING THE RIGHT THING BY YOU, YOU SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE. IT MEANS REBUILDING AMERICA'S CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY. CLEANER TRANSPORTATION THAT WILL NOT ONLY MAKE US SAFER AND MAKE OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR CHILDREN, BUT IT WILL PROVIDE MILLIONS OF GOOD-PAYING, MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS. IT MEANS INVESTING MUCH MORE IN MEDICAL RESEARCH TO CONQUER DEVASTATING DISEASES LIKE CANCER AND ADDICTION AND ALZHEIMER'S. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. INVEST IN IT. [APPLAUSE] LOOK, FOLKS. WE CAN DO ALL THIS WITHOUT PUNISHING ANYBODY. YOU KNOW, WHEN REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT, THERE WERE 800 BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXPENDITURES. MEANING TAX LOOPHOLES. KNOW WHAT IT IS TODAY? IT'S OVER $1,600,000,000,000. WE COULD SEND EVERY ONE IN AMERICA TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR FREE, SIX MILLION FOLKS. SIX MILLION FOLKS. BY DOING ONE THING. ELIMINATING ONE LOOPHOLE. THE $1.6 TRILLION. IT ROBS THE COUNTRY OF EVERY , IT ROBS THE COUNTRY OF $17 BILLION A YEAR. IF YOU GET A CAPITAL GAIN, YOU'RE ABOUT TO CASH IT IN. GOT FOR BIG YOU GET HIT A TRUCK, YOU LEAVE IT TO YOUR CHILD THEY , PAY NO TAX. IT'S NOT INHITTERED TAX. IF YOU ELIMINATE THAT ONE, YOU CAN CUT EVERY COLLEGE CUT COST IN HALF AND YOU CAN IN FACT HAVE $11 BILLION LEFT TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT. [APPLAUSE] SO, FOLKS, QUITE FRANKLY, THE ONLY THING THAT STANDSES IN OUR WAY IS OUR BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM. THAT IS THE LIBERTY BEING UNDERMINED BY OUR PRESIDENT TO BEST IS DELIBERATELY BEING , THAT'S DELIBERATELY BEING UNDERMINED BY OUR PRESIDENT TO CONTINUE TO ABUSE THE POWER OF THE OFFICE. DONALD TRUMP IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT WHO HAS DECIDED NOT TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE COUNTRY. THE PRESIDENT HAS HIS BASE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WORKS FOR ALL AMERICANS. AND WE CAN AFFORD THIS. WE CAN DO THIS. AND I'M OPTIMISTIC FOR TWO REASONS. ONE, I KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE JOURNEY OF THIS COUNTRY. WHEN ORDINARY AMERICANS LIKE MY FAMILY ARE GIVEN AN EVEN CHANCE, JUST AN EVEN CHANCE, THEY COULD EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. , THEY DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. THEY HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN. AND THE SECOND REASON I'M OPTIMISTIC IS THAT I KNOW WE ARE IN BETTER POSITION THAN ANY NATION IN THE WORLD TO ON THE BEST TO OWN , TO OWN THE 21ST CENTURY. WE NOT ONLY HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD, WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS IN THE WORLD. THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS THE WORKERS IN ASIA. NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY MAKES US INDEPENDENT. THE U.S. HAS MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES WHERE ALL THESE MAJOR BREAKTHROUGHS COME FROM THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. NO OTHER NATION IN THE WORLD CAN MATCH US. WE CAN BRING IN BE A POSITIVE FORCE FOR EVERYONE. FOLKS, THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF. FOLKS, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. AND I BELIEVE, I BELIEVE AND HOPE THEY KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE DEMOCRATS, WE INDEPENDENTS WHO HAVE THE SAME VIEW, HAVE TO CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. UNITY OR DIVISION. MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, TRUTH OVER LIES. TRUTH OVER LIES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS. [CHANTING] THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY, NOT A SINGLE THING. SO GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS! THANK YOU!

WE'LL TAKE YOU BACK LIVE TO DUBUQUE, IOWA, TO JOE BIDEN. (music) I LOVE THIS CITY, MY FAMILY DOES, WE HAVE MADE SO, SO MANY GOOD, GOOD FRIENDS. PAM, WE TALKED EARLIER. YOU KNOW, HOW MANY OF YOU IN THIS AUDIENCE HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE TO CANCER OR LOST A LOVED ONE TO A SERIOUS DISEASE? YOU GET IT. YOU GET IT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT PAM AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT IT. THERE'S SO MANY HEROES IN AMERICA AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. WHO SUFFERED A HECK OF A LOT MORE THAN ME AND MY FAMILY HAVE SUFFERED. WHO , BUT DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE KIND OF HELP THAT I'VE HAD AND THE SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY AND FROM FRIENDS. FRAND FAMILY. YET THEY GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY, THEY WALK OUT AND PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER. THEY DO THEIR JOB. THEY CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. THEY CARE FOR THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM. AND I THINK THEY DESERVE AN INCREDIBLY BETTER CIRCUMSTANCE THAN MANY OF THEM FIND THEMSELVES IN. FOLKS, IN ONE OF THE , ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO RUN FOR VICE PRESIDENT, OR PRESIDENT OR BEING ABLE TO BE OUT AROUND THE COUNTRY IS IN THE PROCESS, YOU NOT ONLY MEET SUPPORTERS BUT A LOT OF YOUR SUPPORTERS BECOME GENUINELY YOUR CLOSE, PERSONAL FRIENDS. IT'S AN INORDINATE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET SOME INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. AND THERE'S NO CITY IN THE COUNTRY I'VE MET MORE DECENT, HONORABLE AND CARING PEOPLE AND I REALLY MEAN THAT DIDN'T PLAN ON GOING INTO THAT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT , ANYWAY. I JUST THINK THERE'S, YOU KNOW, MY , JILL, MY WIFE, ACTUALLY, I'M HER HUSBAND. [LAUGHTER] Y'ALL THINK I'M KIDDING, DON'T YOU? NO, NO, NO. I'M KNOWN AS JILL'S HUSBAND AND PROUD OF IT. I HAD TO WORK REAL HARD TO GET THAT TITLE. HAD TO ASK HER FIVE TIMES TO MARRY ME. FIVE. THAT'S GOD'S TRUTH. [APPLAUSE] SOME OF YOU KNOW, THE LAST TIME I WAS AT ANDY YOUNG, WE WERE IN SOUTH AFRICA, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SEE NELSON MANDELA WITH THE BLACK CAUCUS. I CAME BACK AFTER I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY DAY, SIX, EIGHT, 10 DAYS AWAY, GOT OFF THE PLANE IN PHILADELPHIA, WENT BACK, STOPPED AT HER APARTMENT, KNOCKED ON THE DOOR I SAID JILLY , YOU GOT MY IRISH PRIDE UP NOW. I WANT TO TELL YOU, I MEAN THIS SINCERELY, IT'S OK IF YOU SAY NO BUT THIS IS THE LASTTIME I'M GOING TO ASK YOU. LAST TIME. I'M NOT ASKING YOU WHEN BUT IF, WILL YOU MARRY ME? SHE LOOKED AT ME AND WENT LIKE THIS. OK. MY SISTER, A LOT OF YOU KNOW VALLEY, LATER ASKED HER, WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? SHE SAID I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE BOYS. THAT'S ANOTHER STORY. BUT FOLKS LOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO BE SEEING A LOT OF ME. [APPLAUSE] I PROMISE YOU THIS. NO ONE IS GOING TO WORK HARDER TO WIN YOUR TRUST AND YOUR HELP. I MEAN THAT SINCERELY. AND I WANT TO THANK DENISE DOLE FOR BEING HERE OUR COUNTY AUDITOR. I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR AND THE REAL MAYOR DEB FOR BEING HERE. [APPLAUSE] Y'ALL THINK I'M KIDDING, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IF YOU ARE THE SPOUSE OF A MAYOR, A SPOUSE OF A GOVERNOR, YOU WORK FULL-TIME FOR NOTHING. ANYWAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND I ALSO , I ALSO WANT TO THANK KEN, FORMER DUBUQUE COUNTY SHERIFF WHO IS WITH US. HAD THE GREAT HONOR OF RECOMMENDING HIM TO BE U.S. MARSHAL AND HE DID ONE HECK OF A JOB FOR US. [APPLAUSE] LINDSEY, CONGRATULATIONS, KID. CONGRATULATIONS. WONDERFUL. I REALLY MEAN IT. AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, RICK AND OUR FORMER STATE REPRESENTATIVE AND PRESIDENT OF DUBUQUE TISSUE GREATER DUBUQUE DEVELOPMENT, I GET THAT BACKWARDS. DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. ANYWAY DOING A HELL OF A JOB, PAL. [APPLAUSE] AND KATHY FLYNN, FORMER COUNTY TREASURER AND I TALK ABOUT YOU BECOME GOOD FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE. TO TERRY, JOHN, ELLEN GOODMAN AND THE WHOLE FAMILY, THEY'VE BEEN GREAT SUPPORTERS, GREAT FRIENDS, WE HAVE NEVER LOST CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER FROM THE TIME WE MET YEARS AGO. AND , [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE TO SUGGEST, I THINK WE ALL KNOW, WHETHER YOU'RE A 15-YEAR-OLD KID OR WHETHER YOU'RE MY AGE, ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SPECTRUM. YOU KNOW IN YOUR GUT THIS ELECTION FOR PRESIDENT IS DIFFERENT THAN ANY WE'VE SEEN IN OUR LIFETIME. NOT A JOKE. NOT ABOUT ME. IT'S ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE FIND OURSELVES IN. THE CORE VALUES OF THIS NATION ARE STANDING IN THE WORLD WHICH I WILL BE GIVING A , I'LL TALK AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT OUR FOREIGN POLICY OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD, OUR VERY DEMOCRACY, EVERYTHING THAT'S MADE AMERICA, AMERICA, IS AT STAKE. WE ALL KNOW WHY. LIMIT IT TO FOUR YEARS, HISTORY WILL TREAT THIS ADMINISTRATION'S TIME AS AN ABERRATION IN TIME. BUT, IF THERE'S EIGHT YEARS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, I THINK IT WILL , I MEAN THIS SINCERELY, WILL FOREVER AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE AND ALTER THE CHARACTER AND TRAJECTORY OF THIS NATION. FOLKS, BEYOND DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, AND BY THE WAY THIS IS NOT YOUR FATHER'S REPUBLICAN PARTY AS THE OLD SAYING GOES, THIS IS A DIFFERENT BREED OF CAT NOW. THEY TALK ABOUT THERE'S DIVISION IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WE AGREE ON BASICALLY EVERYTHING, ALL OF US RUNNING, ALL 400 OF US. [LAUGHTER] BUT I KNOW TOO MANY OF MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE, THIS IS NOT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THERE'S GREAT DIVISIONS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. BUT LOOK, FOLKS, WE CAN'T LET EIGHT YEARS OF THIS PRESIDENT, BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL FOREVER AND FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE VERY CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. FOLKS, THE THREAT THAT IS POSED TO THIS NATION IS UNLIKE, AS I SAID, ANY I'VE SEEN IN MY LIFETIME. YOU KNOW, I SAW IT MOST VIVIDLY IN CHARLOTTESVILLE DOWN IN VIRGINIA. YOU KNOW, THESE FOLKS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 1920'S WHEN THE KLAN MARCHED DOWN THE STREETS BY THE THOUSANDS ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE, THE SENATE, SOME GOVERNORS WERE MEMBERS OF THE KLAN, SINCE THEN I DON'T REMEMBER ANY TIME, AT LEAST IN MY LIFETIME, THAT'S HISTORICAL CONTEXT I TALKED ABOUT WITH JON MEACHAM, WHO WROTE \"THE SOUL OF AMERICA,\" OUT IN THE OPEN, OUT IN THE FIELDS AT NIGHT, CARRYING TORCHES, CRAZED LOOKS ON THEIR FACES, CARRYING TORCHES AND SWASTIKAS. ACCOMPANIED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS. CHANTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT WAS CHANTED IN THE 1930'S IN GERMANY AND YOU KNOW, AND THEN MANY IN THE ALT RIGHT AND THIS PRESIDENT, WHEN THEY WERE CONFRONTED BY DECENT, HONORABLE PEOPLE, WHO HAD THE COURAGE TO STAND AGAINST THIS HATE AND VIOLENCE ENSUED, THE RESPONSE WHEN ASKED WHAT DID HE THINK, HE SAID, QUOTE, VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT OR ANYBODY WHO I'VE KNOWN WAS RUNNING IN THE PAST EXCEPT MAYBE GEORGE WALLACE IN THE 1960'S, I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS, I'M BEING SERIOUS. HAS SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW, IN A FEW DAYS , YOU KNOW, A FEW DAYS LATER, AFTER HE WAS ASKED ABOUT WHAT I SAID, HE DOUBLED DOWN. CONCOCTING A PHONY STORY ABOUT HOW THOSE VIOLENT THUGS ONLY WANTED TO PROTECT THE STATUE OF ROBERT E. LEE. GIVE ME A BREAK, MAN. GIVE ME A BREAK. FOLKS, IT'S NONSENSE THAT RALLY WAS ADVERTISED. IT WAS ADVERTISED. AS A WHITE SUPREMACY RALLY. THE ANTI-SEMITIC CHANTS ABOUT JEWS IN AMERICA COULD BE HEARD AROUND THE WORLD. AROUND THE WORLD. HATRED WAS ON THE MARCH AND HE KNEW IT. I SAID AT THE TIME, I WROTE AT THE TIME, IN \"ATLANTIC\" MAGAZINE, THAT WE'RE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. AND WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. IT'S NOT WHO THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE. THAT'S WHY ABOVE ALL ELSE, WE HAVE TO PUT AN END TO THIS ADMINISTRATION. [APPLAUSE] BUT , THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH. STAKES ARE TOO HIGH. THE SECOND REASON I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, QUITE FRANKLY, IS , THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH FOR THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA. I CALL IT THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA. MIDDLE CLASS, HARDWORKING AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE STAKES ARE MUCH TOO HIGH. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT. THIS COUNTRY WAS NOT BUILT BY WALL STREET. BANKERS. HEDGE FUND MANAGERS. THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY BAD, IT WASN'T BUILT BY THEM. IT WAS BUILT BY MY AND YOUR ANCESTORS, ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO DID EXTRAORDINARY THINGS, NOT ONLY DEFENDING THE COUNTRY BUT BUILDING THIS COUNTRY ACROSS THE BOARD. WASN'T BUILT BY THEM, IT WAS BUILT BY YOU, BY THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS. ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO DID EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY , HE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY IS THAT WHEN GIVEN HALF A CHANCE ORDINARY PEOPLE DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. GIVE THEM SOMETHING APPROXIMATING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. FOLKS, WHAT HAPPENED? SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE IN YOUR STATE AND MINE AND ALL ACROSS AMERICA ARE WORRIED, WORRIED THE AMERICAN DREAM IS SLIPPING FROM THEIR GRASP AND WON'T EVEN BE AVAILABLE TO THEIR CHILDREN, JUST LOOK AT THE DATA, LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF ATTITUDES. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN POINT TO AS TO WHY IT HAPPEN. BUT WHAT STANDS OUT TO ME IS THAT IT USED TO BE A BASIC BARGAIN IN AMERICA. BUT TODAY THAT BARGAIN HAS , DROVE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL GROWTH IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, LITERALLY, NOT FIGURATIVELY, THAT BARGAIN HAS BEEN BROKEN. THE BARGAIN WAS SIMPLE. IF YOU WORKED HARD, PART OF A SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISE AND SUCCEEDED YOU GOT TO SHARE THE BENEFITS. BUT THAT'S CHANGED. THAT'S CHANGED. WHEN THEIR ENTERPRISE HIT HARD TIMES, WHAT HAPPENED? EVERYBODY TOOK A HIT FROM THE C.E.O. TO THE SECRETARIES. BUT THAT'S CHANGED. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO NOW BENEFIT WHEN THE COUNTRY DOES WELL ARE THE C.E.O.'S AND THE STOCKHOLDERS. FOLKS, THINGS HAVE CHANGED. I HAVE A CARTOON HANGING IN MY OFFICE, I HAD IT THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I WAS VICE PRESIDENT. IT'S A CARTOON FROM \"THE NEW YORKER\" MAGAZINE AND HAS A PICTURE OF A BIG, STOUT GUY IN A BLACK TURTLENECK, BLACK BERET, BLACK MASK ON AND HE'S SITTING AT A TABLE BEING INTERROGATED AND THERE'S A BIG BAG, BURLAP BAG ON THE TABLE WITH A DOLLAR SIGN ON IT. HE'S LOOKING AT IT AND SAYING I'M SORRY. HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW HE WAS A JOB CREATOR? SINCE WHEN ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE THE JOB CREATORS CAN BENEFIT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STOCKHOLDERS AND C.E.O.'S? LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT OUR AUTOMOBILES ON THE ASSEMBLYLINE AND SELL THEM ARE THEY NO LONGER JOB CREATORS? THE PEOPLE WHO GROW OUR FOOD, TRANSPORT OUR FOOD, PROTECT US, ARE THEY NOT JOB CREATORS? I REALLY MEAN IT. THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT HOW FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S CHANGED. I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO WONKY HERE BUT MILTON FRIEDMAN, A CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIST IN THE LATE 1980'S SAID THERE'S ONLY ONE OBLIGATION A CORPORATION HAS AND THAT'S TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THE EMPLOYEE, THE COMMUNITY THEY LIVE IN, THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION BUT THEY WALKED AWAY FROM IT. AN AWFUL LOT OF CORPORATIONS KNOW IT. KNOW IT. FRANKLY, THEY'RE AFRAID IF THEY DO IT THE RIGHT WAY THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH THOSE WHO ARE DOING IT THE WRONG WAY. SO FOLKS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS. THEY HAVE TO CHANGE IT IN A WAY SO WHEN FOLKS AS I SAID WHO GROW OUR FOOD PRORK SAYS OUR FOOD, PACKAGE, ETC., THEY SHOULD SUCCEED WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE SUCCEEDS IN THAT CORPORATION, WHEN THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE OTHER FOLKS SUCCEED. [APPLAUSE]MR. BIDEN: YOU KNOW, MY DADDY IS TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS BECAUSE HE DID SAY THIS ALL OF THE TIME. HE SAID JOE, A JOB IS MORE ABOUT A PAYCHECK, IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, ABOUT RESPECT, IT IS ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS ABOUT YOUR STANDING, IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY HONEY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. AND MEAN IT, KNOW IT. FOLKS, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF WORKING AMERICANS DON'T HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE THEY CAN LOOK THEIR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY IT IS GOING TO BE OK. IT IS GOING TO BE OK. BECAUSE FOLKS, THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO CHANGE. THIS TIME WHEN WE REBUILD, WE REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE HAVE TO BRING EVERYONE ALONG NO MATTER THEIR RACE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, RELIGION, WHO THEY LOVE ARE WHERE THEY LIVE. I REALLY MEAN IT. [APPLAUSE] AND FOLKS, THAT WILL BE THE MEASURE I WILL CONSIDER ECONOMIC SUCCESS IF I'M ELECTED, NOT JUST THE GDP. IT IS WELL BEYOND THAT. THAT WILL AT ITS CORE, IT IS REALLY ABOUT RESTORING THE DIGNITY OF WORK. KING ABLE TO PROVIDE AND BY THAT I MEAN BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE YOUR FAMILY SECURITY, AND PEACE OF MIND. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT HAS BEEN STRIPPED FROM PEOPLE. HOW CAN A PERSON'S DIGNITY BE MAINTAINED IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE CARE OF A SICK CHILD BECAUSE I HAVE A PREEXISTED , PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND CAN TAKE CARE OF THEM? HOW IS APPARENT STING 80 MEANT TO BE MAINTAINED WHEN THEY HAVE A CHILD WHO HAS A TERMINAL ILLNESS AND NOW THEY WILL BE TOLD BY THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF YOUR COVERAGE, NO MORE CARE. I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT WITH BEAU. WE KNEW IT WAS TERMINAL, WHAT HE HAD. HE FOUGHT LIKE THE DOUBLE BRAVELY, FOR A YEAR. THAT FOLKS, I CANNOT IMAGINE AN INSURANCE COMING ALONG AND TELLING ME ENOUGH, YOU HAVE TO STOP. NO MORE COVERAGE. THINK OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO BEFORE WE PASSED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WERE IN THAT POSITION. BEING STRIPPED OF THEIR DIGNITY. HOW CAN A PARENT MAINTAIN HIS OR HER DIGNITY IF THEIR CHILD WHO HAS THE CAPACITY AND DESIRE TO GO BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL, IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR EDUCATION? WHETHER IT IS TRADE SCHOOL, COMMUNITY COLLEGE, WHATEVER IT IS. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A KID, I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A SCHOOL THAT I CANNOT AFFORD TO GET TO. I WANTED TO GO. I REMEMBER GOING DOWN THE NIGHT OF MY SENIOR PROM TO CHANGE CARS WITH MY DAD, HE RAN A CAR DEALERSHIP AND I GOT , AND I ALWAYS GOT A NICE CAR TO PROM NIGHTS. DRIVING DOWN TO A BASEBALL GAME TO HIS BUSINESS, PARKING THE CAR, MY 51 PLYMOUTH WAS , WHICH WAS REALLY GREAT BY THE WAY, THAT WAS EVEN OLD FOR ME THEN. IRAN AND I ASKED, WHERE HIS DAD? SHE SAID HE IS OUT IN THE LANE WHERE THEY ARE FIXING THE CARS. I WALKED OUT, AND I CAN'T THINK HOW MANY PARENTS GO THROUGH THIS. I SAID WHAT IS A MATTER? HE SAID I'M SO SORRY, PAL. I'M SO SORRY. I LOOKED AT HIM AND , THIS BEFORE CELL PHONES, I FELT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER, SISTER, MY MOM. I SAID WHAT'S THE MATTER? IS THAT I WENT TO THE BANK TODAY TO BORROW THE MONEY TO HELP YOU GET THERE, AND HE SAID THEY WILL NOT LEND ME THE MONEY. I'M SO ASHAMED. HE HAD NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED ABOUT. BUT THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THIS JUNE WHO ARE GOING TO BE SITTING AROUND THEIR KITCHEN TABLE SAYING, WHO IS GOING TO TELL HER? WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO GET HER BACK TO SCHOOL. WE WILL HAVE TO DO THE FOLLOWING. THOUSANDS, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE MAKING THOSE JUDGMENTS. BECAUSE EDUCATION IS BEING PRICED OUT OF CONTROL. YOU KNOW, THE PHILOSOPHER KANT DEFINED DIGNITY THIS WAY, HE SAID DIGNITY IS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NEVER BE TREATED AS A MEANS TO AN END, THAT AS AN END IN THEMSELVES. THINK ABOUT IT. [APPLAUSE] END, THAT AS AN END IN THEMSELVES. THE NEW EMERGING CORPORATE CULTURE, THINK ABOUT THE TAX-CUT, YOU HAVE TWICE AS MANY CORPORATIONS MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PAYING NO TAXES AT ALL. IT IS NOT ABOUT , I KNOW YOU ARE SUPPORTING BY BILLING BUT HERE'S THE DEAL, IT IS NOT RIGHT. IT IS SIMPLY NOT RIGHT. AND FOLKS, LOOK, THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE IN A POSITION WHERE DIGNITY DOES NOT COME INTO THE THOUGHT PROCESS OF SO MANY EMPLOYERS THESE DAYS. AND YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOT ONLY MAKING IT HARDER TO MEET THE BASIC NEEDS OF HARD-WORKING MIDDLE-CLASS, WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE BY STRIPPING THEM OF THEIR DIGNITY, JUST TALK TO UNION MEMBERS. THERE HAS BEEN A WAR ON LABOR'S RIGHT TO BARGAIN FOR A LONG TIME BUT WE HAVE GONE BEYOND THAT. THINK OF ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST 10 YEARS OR SO. THERE'S ALSO , 40% OF WORKERS HAVE TO SIGN A NONCOMPETE CLAUSE AT SOME POINT IN THEIR CAREER. NONCOMPETE AGREEMENTS HAVE ONE PURPOSE, TO HOLD DOWN THE ABILITY TO BARGAIN FOR YOURSELF. I CAN UNDERSTAND IT IF YOU WORK FOR A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AND YOU HAVE SERIOUS SECRETS OR WHATEVER. BUT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT FOR WORKERS. WHY IN GODS NAME TO DO SO MANY HAVE TO SIGN NONCOMPETE AGREEMENTS? THERE IS NO OTHER RATIONALE THAN TO HOLD DOWN WAGES. FOLKS, LOOK, WHAT HAS HAPPENED LATELY AS WELL. DO COMPANIES CLASSIFIED LOW-WAGE WORKERS AS MANAGERS? WHY DO THEY DO THAT? THEY DO IT FOR A SIMPLE REASON. BECAUSE UNDER THE LAW, IF YOU ARE NOT IN MANAGEMENT, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO OVERTIME. JUST LAST YEAR ALONE, LAST YEAR ALONE, 4 MILLION HOURLY WORKERS WERE CHEATED OUT OF $1.2 BILLION IN LOST WAGES. WHERE DID IT GO? GET WENT IN THE CORPORATE CAUSES. THEY DID NOT EXPAND, THEY BOUGHT BACK THEIR OWN STOCK, RAISING THE STOCK PRICES FROM THE STOCKHOLDERS AND ENRICHING THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF PAY. , SPEAKING OF STOCK, OVERTIME, I THINK IT IS LONG PAST TIME THAT WE PASS A NATIONAL $15 AN HOUR MINIMUM WAGE. [APPLAUSE] ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. LOOK, I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I AM GOING TO DO AS PRESIDENT, BUT I WILL NOT TAKE THE WHOLE TIME NOW. WE WILL LAY , YOU WILL HEAR IT WHEN I COME BACK IN SPECIFICS. HERE'S THE DEAL. THE FIRST STEP AS PRESIDENT, MY GOAL WILL BE TO REWARD WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. WORK. [APPLAUSE] TRILLION IN LOOPHOLES. THEY CALL IT EXPENDITURES PER $1.6 TRILLION AND OUR TAX CODE THAT ARE CALLED TAX EXPENDITURES. YOU CANNOT JUSTIFY ANYWHERE NEAR ALL OF IT. AT A MINIMUM, $300 BILLION ARE TOTAL WASTE IN GIVEAWAYS TO THE SUPER WEALTHY. BY THE WAY, I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF EVEN THOSE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT AND THEY ARE PREPARED TO GIVE IT UP. HERE'S THE DEAL, TO LOOK AT THEM AND SAY HERE IT IS, THEY SAY DON'T GIVE ME THAT TAX BREAK. WE HAVE TO STOP, WE HAVE TO NOT BE AFRAID TO MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE TRUMP , WE HAVE TO CUT THE TOP TAX RATE FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. HE CUT THE TOP TAX FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. ALL OF THESE LOOPHOLES. HIS TAX BILLS SHIP JOBS OVERSEAS AND REWARDED IT. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? THEN THEY INCREASED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS TAX-CUT $2 TRILLION INCREASE IN THE NATIONAL DEBT. TO TRILLION DOLLARS. I PREDICTED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN , ANYWAYS, I GO BACK TO THE ROTH CAMP STUFF. I PREDICTED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THE NEXT THING WOULD BE WE HAVE THIS TRIED TO , THIS GIGANTIC DEFICIT, WE CAN'T SUSTAIN IT SO WE HAVE TO FIND CUTS. WHERE DO THEY GO? THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET, THEY GO WITH MEDICARE, MEDICAID, SOCIAL SECURITY. MARK MY WORDS, IF HE IS REELECTED AND THE REPUBLICANS GAINED CONTROL, KEEP CONTROL OF THE SENATE, THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BATTLE OF OUR LIVES. IF I'M PRESIDENT, IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO GET RID OF THESE CAPITAL GAINS CUTS AND LOOPHOLES FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. WARREN BUFFETT, A BILLIONAIRE SAID IT, HE POINTED OUT BECAUSE THEY CAPITAL GAINS TREATMENT I GET, I PAID A LOWER TAX RATE THAN MY SECRETARY. HOW CAN THAT POSSIBLY BE JUSTIFIED? HOW CAN IT BE JUSTIFIED? FOLKS, LOOK, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, WE SHOULD BE REWARDING WORK NOT JUST WEALTH. WE HAVE TO FINISH THE JOB. ON HEALTH CARE. WHEN WE PASSED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, I TOLD PRESIDENT OBAMA IT WAS A BIG DEAL, OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] BUT FOLKS, I WANT TO STOP AND SAY SOMETHING THAT I DO NOT THINK IS SAID OFTEN ENOUGH. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER. REALLY, I MEAN IT. [APPLAUSE] EXTRAORDINARY INTEGRITY, A MAN OF ABSOLUTE DECENCY. HE WAS PRESIDENT, OUR KIDS COULD , HAD SOMEONE TO LOOK UP TO. I WAS PROUD EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY AS I STOOD NEXT TO HIM AS HIS VICE PRESIDENT BUT NEVER MORE PROUD THAN THE DAY WE PASSED THAT LAW. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS A GIGANTIC STEP FOR THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, FOR OUR FUTURE. WE MADE HISTORIC PROGRESS. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT EXTENDED TO 22 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE IT BEFORE. WE COVERED PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. I COULD GO ON WITH A LIST. [APPLAUSE] BUT NOW, WE HAVE TO FINISH THE JOB. WE HAVE TO FINISH THE JOB. WE HAVE TO MOVE FOR MAKING HEALTH CARE A PRIVILEGE TO A BRIGHT. HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT. TO GIVE EVERYONE, EVERYONE THE PEACE OF MIND THEY MADE. HEALTH CARE IS ABOUT PEACE OF MIND. HOW MANY PEOPLE GO TO BED AT NIGHT STARING AT THE CEILING THINKING MY GOD, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME, YOU WILL LOSE EVERYTHING. MY FAMILY WILL LOSE EVERYTHING. FOLKS, I BELIEVE WHETHER OR NOT YOUR HEALTH CARE IS COVERED THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER, WHETHER IT IS COVERED ON YOUR OWN OR NOT AT ALL, EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE TO BUY INTO A PUBLIC OPTION HEALTH CARE PLAN LIKE MEDICARE. EVERY SINGLE PERSON. [APPLAUSE] YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PRIVATE PLAN IF YOU WANT. BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE AN OPTION TO BE ABLE TO BUY AND. THIRDLY, I THINK WE HAVE TO INVEST MORE IN EDUCATION. EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF THIS IN DETAIL BECAUSE WHEN I GREW UP IN HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, EVERYONE KNEW ABOUT THE IOWA TEST. EVERYONE KNEW ABOUT WHAT AN INCREDIBLE SCHOOL SYSTEM YOU HAD. I REALLY MEAN IT. I KNOW YOU VALUE IT. LOOK AT WHAT YOUR REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR HAS DONE TO IT AMONG OTHER THINGS. I'M SERIOUS. BUT FOLKS, WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE TRUMP EDUCATION , TRUMP-DEVOS EDUCATION AGENDA. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE TO START BY GIVING PEOPLE THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. 12 YEARS OF EDUCATION IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT IN THE MIDDLE CLASS AND THE 21ST CENTURY. AND THAT IS A FACT. THE FACTS ARE THAT 65 OUT OF EVERY 100 JOBS IN AMERICA TODAY REQUIRES SOMETHING BEYOND A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION, TODAY. THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HIGH PAID , DECENT PAYING JOBS IN HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIES THAT THEY CANNOT BE FILLED BECAUSE WE ARE NOT TRAINING THE PEOPLE, WE'RE NOT GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THE COST , ANYBODY LATELY HAVE TO PAY COLLEGE TUITION? RAISE YOUR HAND. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IT IS INCREDIBLE. BY THE WAY, BE CAREFUL IF YOU PICK A PRIVATE COLLEGE. OUR KIDS ARE GRADUATING IN INCREDIBLE DEBT. I WILL RELEASE A PLAN THAT I DO NOT WANT TO KEEP YOU STANDING LONGER, BUT IT MAKES SURE WE CAN CUT THEIR DEBT. REDUCE THEIR DEBT. [APPLAUSE] BUT FOLKS, I HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO SAY BUT I WILL NOT SAY IT BECAUSE I HAVE ALREADY CAP DO STANDING TOO LONG. HERE'S THE DEAL. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE ECONOMY WORKS NOT ONLY FOR FOLKS WITH FOUR-YEAR DEGREES AND GRADUATE DEGREES BEYOND THAT. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS FOR THOSE WHO COMPLETE ON-THE-JOB TRAINING, TRADE PROGRAMS, COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BECAUSE THERE IS PLENTY TO DO OUT THERE. THERE IS A LOT MORE WE NEED TO DO TO RESTORE THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE NEED TO BE MORE AMBITIOUS THAN WE ARE NOW. TO DO THE THINGS WE HAD TALKED ABOUT DOING IN THE LAST , IN OUR ADMINISTRATION. I WAS INTERVIEWED BY ONE OF YOUR STATEWIDE RADIO FOLKS TODAY. THEY WERE QUOTING ME ABOUT EARLY ON IN MY TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CONTROL, CLIMATE CHANGE, THE NEED TO DEAL , IT WENT ON AND ON. IT IS LONG OVERDUE. IT IS LONG OVERDUE. AS WE REBUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIS COUNTRY, WE HAVE TO BUILD A GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. WE CAN DO THAT. CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY. I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO HERE AND THE JOBS CREATED BY WIND AND RENEWABLE ENERGY. CLEANER, SAFER, AND FASTER TRANSPORTATION. WE HAVE A PLAN THAT I WILL REINTRODUCE IT TO MAKE SURE IT GETS DONE, ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS YOU CAN'T STOP TO CHARGE. WE HAVE , WE SHOULD HAVE CHARGING STATIONS IN EVERY HIGHWAY IN THE COUNTRY. IF YOU CAN DO THAT WITH BICYCLES IN TOWN AND YOU CAN PUT A NICKEL , I'M SERIOUS. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHAT ARE WE DOING? THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THIS WILL NOT ONLY HELP THE EGGS IS A , THE EXISTENTIAL THREATS THAT EXISTS UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING SERIOUS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE NOW, WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. [APPLAUSE] BUT THOSE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS. YOU CAN RAISE A FAMILY ON. YOU CAN RAISE A FAMILY ON. FOLKS, THE IDEA THAT WE CAN DO THIS IS BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION. WE CAN DO THIS ALL WITHOUT PUNISHING ANYBODY. BY ELIMINATING THE HUNDREDS OF BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY, AND IT WILL NOT PUNISH ANYBODY. WE CONSENT EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY PERSON IN AMERICA QUALIFIED TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE FORPERSON IN AMERICA QUALIFIED TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR FREE, IT COSTS $6 BILLION. WE CAN DO IT BY A LIMITING A 17 , A $17 BILLION TAX LOOPHOLE BY $1.6 TRILLION IN TAX LOOPHOLES. IT IS CALLED STEP UP ACES. IF GOD FOR BID YOU GET HIT BY A TRUCK AND YOU ARE ABOUT TO PAY YOUR TAX ON IT AND IT IS LEFT TO YOUR CHILD, THEY DO NOT HAVE TO PAY ANY TAXES AT IT WAS A TAX CODE 10 SECONDS EARLIER. WE COULD PUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT IS QUALIFIED IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE, CUT IN HALF OF THE COST OF A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE BECAUSE YOUR STATE UNIVERSITY EXCEPT THE TRANSFERS OF THE CREDIT IN ALMOST EVERY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND GIVE PEOPLE OPPORTUNITIES AND A JOB. THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE, FOLKS. IT IS SIMPLE BASIC STUFF. SPEAKING OF ROCKET SCIENCE, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE. WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS, ENORMOUS POSSIBILITY. IF WE JUST INVEST. IN MY GENERAL WE CAN DO IF WE INVEST MORE MONEY LIKE WE DID WITH CANCER RESEARCH AS WE LEFT AS VICE PRESIDENT. HERE'S THE DEAL, WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERING DISEASES LIKE CANCER, ALZHEIMER'S, ADDICTION, SO MANY THINGS OUT THERE THAT WOULD NOT ONLY SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES AND EXTEND THEIR LIVES, BUT SAVE THE COUNTRY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BILLIONS. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. THE GHET , LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH WHAT YOU'RE REPUBLICAN FRIENDS DID WITH PRIVATIZING MEDICAID. SERIOUSLY. YOU HAVE NOT LOST LIKE OTHER STATES YOUR RURAL HOSPITALS. TALK TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN PLACES LIKE , WHERE I CAMPAIGNED IN MONTANA AND NORTH DAKOTA, IN THE BIG STATES. WE ARE LITERALLY PUTTING PEOPLE'S LIVES IN JEOPARDY IS WHEN THOSE HOSPITALS CLOSE. GOD FOR BID YOU ARE IN AN ACCIDENT. THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FIRST RESPONDERS. IT IS BETTER IF YOU CAN SAVE A LIFE IF YOU CAN GET THEM TO A HOSPITAL IN FIVE OR 10 MINUTES RATHER THAN AN HOUR. THERE IS SO MUCH HERE THAT IS WITHIN OUR CAPACITY TO DO. I GET TOO EXCITED ABOUT THIS. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] LOOK, THE REASON I'M SO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO IF WE GET UP AND REMEMBER WHO IN GOD'S NAME WE ARE, CHANGE THIS ADMINISTRATION. I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WE ARE BETTER POSITIONED THAN ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO OWN THE 21ST CENTURY. NOT A JOKE. WHEN I GOT ELECTED AT 29 AND WAS SAID TO , I WAS TO YOUNG TO BE SWORN IN, I WAS OPTIMISTIC. THIS GENERATION OF COLLEGE KIDS, THE MILLENNIALS, THEY ARE THE BEST EDUCATED GENERATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON. THEY KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. [APPLAUSE] THEY HAVE ENORMOUS CAPACITY, ENORMOUS CAPACITY. LOOK, I WILL END IT BY SAYING WE NOT ONLY HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD, CAN'T WE LEAD NOT ONLY BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER BUT BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. THAT IS WHAT HAS ALLOWED US TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS IN THE WORLD, FOUR TIMES PRODUCTIVE WORKERS AS IN ASIA, THAT ISRAEL P FOUR TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE. NORTH AMERICA'S ENERGY INDEPENDENT, IF WE DO THE RIGHT THING, WE WILL BE ENERGY INDEPENDENT AND CLEANER WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. AS MY WIFE THE PROFESSOR WOULD SAY, IF YOU DOUBT ME, GOOGLE IT. NOT A JOKE. WE DO. THAT IS WHERE EVERY MAJOR FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE THAT CHANGES PEOPLE'S LIVES HAS COME OUT OF. CORPORATIONS ARE NOT BAD FOLKS, THEY COME ALONG AND THEY MONETIZE IT, WHICH NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT THE RESEARCH, ALMOST EVERY SINGLE BREAKTHROUGH, COMES OUT OF THOSE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES. AND YOU OWN THEM. YOU OWN THEM. THERE ARE PLACES I CAN , I CAN GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE GREAT UNIVERSITIES RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF VIOLENT. I DO NOT KNOW WHY WE THINK WE WALK AROUND LIKE WOE IS ME, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE HAVE TO GET UP. TO GET UP, REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE CAN DO ANYTHING. NOT A JOKE. [APPLAUSE] WE CAN DO ANYTHING WE SET OUR MINDS TO. WHEN JOHN KENNEDY MADE THAT FAMOUS SPEECH ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON, THERE IS ONE LINE EVERY KID IN GRADE SCHOOL KNOWS WHAT IT SAYS. ONE LINE THAT STEP , THAT STUCK WITH ME AND STILL SIX WITH ME, HE SAYS WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER. I REFUSE TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER THE ABILITY TO DO THESE THINGS. IT IS TIME FOR US TO DO THEM. IT IS WITHIN OUR WHEELHOUSE. WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THEM. AND FOLKS, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE HAVE TO LEARN WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE TO KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. [APPLAUSE] WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. WE CHOOSE TRUTHS OVERLIES , OVER LIES. AND WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. PICK UP YOUR HEADS, REMEMBER WHO WE ARE, NOT A JOKE, THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! LET'S GET UP AND MOVE! [APPLAUSE] GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

{"SpeechID":"CSPANJB13520193","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2019-05-13","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden in Hampton, New Hampshire","RawText":"Good to be back into Hampshire thank you. There's a lot of record I was just given a list of everybody is here Tom Sherman Tom here State Sen Sharma Pat there's a whole lot of folks I'm not sure where the recognition starts but let me just start by thanking my 2 colleagues for for welcome me here and kiddo your mommy owes you a big favor for taking you this OK. Whatever you need ice cream or whatever look folks. You know I plan on doing everything I can to earn the respect and the support of the people of New Hampshire I am going to be here a lot bad news for years I'm coming back good news for me is I'm coming back but I want to earn your support and and folks the fact of the matter is that we're in a situation right now where you all know that that this election is bigger than any human in Gage's and not because I'm running or anybody else's running because of occupies the office this is a this election is quite frankly bigger than politics it's more important the fact of the matter is that I'm running for 3 basic reasons and I'm going to be very clear about as I move along and going to great detail as we get down the road here because this is a marathon and I don't want to keep you stand in a long long time even city a long time situation is that I'm running for 3 reasons I want to restore the soul of this country and secondly thank you really want to quite frankly rebuild the backbone of this country this time bringing everybody along the middle class the middle class has built this country and thirdly what I want to do is I want to talk about earlier unite the country folks I know I get criticized for saying that I think we have to unite the country the truth of the matter is we can't get anything done in this country without a consensus is where a constitution is written this way it runs where in a situation where you have to be able to get and generate a consensus to get anything done if you don't do that you end up where we are now. Now you end up with a president who can divide a country based on the ability to garner more power from self or herself the printer who it is and be in a situation where you you just can't can't get anything done when things don't get done that's when executives reach out and claim more power than they're entitled to and so folks the folks at. My dad used to have an expression he said Joey a job's about a lot more than a paycheck it's about your dignity it's about your place in the community it's about your being able to turn and look at your kids and say Honey it's going to be OK and mean it was so few people can do that today so few people wonder whether or not their children are ever going to be in a position they were to be able to lead a good middle class life and there's a lot of there's a lot of folks that are doing well and that's good I'm happy people are doing well but so many people are being left behind and we're the situation as well where you know there used to be a basic bargain in America the basic bargain was if you participate in an enterprise and it made some money and it did well you got to share in the benefits of that but that's not the case anymore because I have a card to hang in a my office and Barack used to always kid me by those from the New Yorker the last 2 years of the office I had and I have it in my office of the university I teach at and it says it shows a picture of a great big guy sitting in a duck looks like an interrogation table is out of the New Yorker magazine and he's wearing a black turtleneck sweater or a black bear or a black mask across his face and is a big dollar there's a big burlap bag on the table with a dollar sign on it and saying you know how was I supposed to know he was that job creator. Well think about it guys all kidding aside our Republican friends in the president adopted the notion that if you are not the C.E.O. of a corporation or you are not a stockholder you have no real equity because you don't create new jobs only the job creators. The ones who get the benefits of the changes take place corporate profits are up gigantically But what's happened people are being left behind because I don't know about you but my dad ran a large automobile agency didn't own it but ran it for years and years he created a heck of a lot of jobs for a lot of people the people on the assembly line and Dell are the General Motors plant that used to exist they create a lot of jobs for people the people are out in the fields you know to them they're going in the soybeans or whatever they're growing they're creating jobs for people but we've lost our sense of who we are it seems to me and we have to reestablish it if the reestablish and the way to start is to get back to the business of beginning to reward work over wealth I'm happy to see people make do do well but here's where we are now Warren Buffett said it best he said you know because I pay only capital gains for everything I make Basically I pay at a lower tax rate than my secretary does a lower tax rate than my secretary does and it's a fact as a fact folks we have to get back in the business of making sure people have an opportunity to make in a way to start that is to make sure that we in fact get rid of this darn tax cut this guy put into but only helps the very very wealthy thank you letter they are no less than a significant number of loopholes and the so far exemptions in the law you know when Reagan was president there were $800000000000.00 in that were collected because of irrational offered that it somehow some good rationale for contributed charity you get a deduction you don't pay at the same rate you don't you know so on but here's the deal there's $1.00 trillion $600.00 and I think $40000000000.01 trillion $600.00 over $600000000000.00  in loopholes the law at least 3 to 400 of those have no justification there's no rationale except rewarding the very very wealthy and they're doing just fine and by the way I believe. The vast majority of when you talk to them would say I get it I give up this that or the other thing in order to make the country better but look at this tax cut has done as well it's created a deficit of 2 trillion dollars And when it passed I said at the time and I'm not always right obviously but I said at the time I don't want to sound like I told you so but I said at the time that what they're going to do is say when it creates this 2 additional 2 trillion dollar debt you know we can't afford to keep that dead we have to do some about that that we created and what are they don't they're going to try to eviscerate the social safety net social security Medicare Medicaid and you think I'm joking now this is not hyperbole before we took back the House of Representatives the Republican head of the committee on the budget call for cutting Medicare by over half a trillion dollars And now you hear the majority leader of the Senate continue to say we have to do something about the entitlement the entitlement to Social Security it cetera and look all of those who are trying to help your grandchildren or children go to college raise your hand if you don't think it's difficult. Nobody put their hand up as difficult as the devil and folks look there's 3 things we have to do to restore people's dignity the 1st one is we have to make sure that health care is a right not a privilege. Thank the way the story that Israel stablish reestablish what Barack and I did in the Affordable Care Act when he when that act passed I said it was a big deal or something to that I thought no one could hear I was Lynn and. Thank god my mom wasn't around out of it. But all kidding aside it was a gigantic And by the way speaking of Iraq I think he doesn't get nearly the kind of credit he was one heck of a President thank you ma'am with great integrity honor thank you Cincy Thank you have a backbone like a ram. So folks look 1st we got to do is by restoring the reef the Affordable Care Act and not letting it continue to be visible this aerated you indicated what how about you know existing condition and or you know you're going to opt out I can't imagine talking to dignity speaking about dignity I can't imagine how a parent can maintain their dignity to look at their child who has a preexisting condition it's not a darn thing you can do Bob if you couldn't afford it or when the insurance company comes along and say Now you have you have you have opted out you've spent too much money I can't imagine what Joe and I would have done. When our son Beau was there for a year we knew it was a terminal illness if they said halfway through I'M SORRY I'M SORRY insurance no more insurance company no more palliative care I can't imagine it's about dignity how can a man or woman go to bed at night staring at the ceiling knowing that there's no way if they get sick they can take care of their families so folks it is about more than just more than just a job it's more than it's about your dignity the 2nd thing is you think about education look 65 and over 100 jobs today today require more than a high school degree today whether or not it's training on a skill or whether or not it's an associate's degree or whether or not it's a community college or beyond $65.00 out of $100.00 and here's the deal folks is going to get tougher 12 years of education is not enough any longer 12 years is not enough to compete My wife has who's a college professor a junior college professor said scuse me community college professor says any country that outcompetes us well I assume you're out education as well compete us and it's a basic simple proposition for example give you one example we can afford to do all these things we can for do all these things if you take a look at the health care piece as I said I think every single solitary person America should be able at least restoring this Affordable Care Act improve it and make it better than it was allow anybody to be able to buy into a Medicaid Medicare like plan we can assure the whole country that way we can do it and allow people to keep their private insurance if they wish but if they don't like it no matter what the circumstance they can buy into a Medicare private plan and look folks the other thing is that we talk about we're talking about education we're in a situation where the cost has become so expensive to send someone to even to this your state universities like university Hampshire University Delaware. I want the cost has skyrocketed to go those schools and for a whole lot of reasons including state legislative bodies and usually run by Republicans have significantly cut the assistance they give to those schools so it gets awful tough it's awful tough we could send for it but we can pay for this with the tax cut that we're going to reverse as well as eliminating some of these loopholes that make no sense thank you let me give you one example I don't want to be generic about I want to give an example for example you could send everyone in this state to a community college for free in the entire United States for free if they're qualified to cut in half the cost of a community college I'm assuming a 4 year degree because in every state you're able to transfer these community college credits to the State University cut in half the cost of education for your education that's a desire but here's the deal it cost $6000000000.00 a year there goes a big spending Democrat Biden man look at him I can eliminate one of the $1.00 trillion dollars in loopholes it's call stepped up basis I hope you know what it is I didn't know stepped up basis means even a capital gains and you are going to cash it in and God forbid you get hit by a truck and you lose you and it gets left to your son or your daughter no taxes paid at all that cost the government 17000000000 dollars years not collected it's not an inheritance tax of a tax to 5 seconds before God forbid something happened. If you just eliminate that one out of one trillion $600.00 plus $1000000000.00 every single solitary kid could go to qualify to go to community college for free cut in half the cost of their 4 year education increase in productivity by 2 tenths of one percent by most studies as well as have $11000000000.00 to put toward the deficit so we can do all these things that we know will I won't go into it now I can I'll be laying it out in great detail so this isn't about big spending it's about fair what is what should be investing is United States America this and look folks you know we have how can we have. Maintain are did they really look at that beautiful young girl there sit with her mom or any of the young kids in here and not be able to guarantee their generation clean air clean water and environment that's real thank you really and truly thankful Oaks You know I I know some of you may have read peddlin an article that was written about Biden's as you know takes the middle ground on the environment. I ask you to go and I will take your time now lolo to look at political acts it's they say one of those guys are good though those groups the best know that goes and challenges what you say and run truth or not truth they take take a look at that I said that I was in this area long before most anybody else was and I have a record and they basically said I won't take the time to read it but it basically said you know Biden is right he's been a leader in climate change and look at we did it one block and I got it the fundamental change way we invested 90000000000 dollars in renewable energy at the front end we doubled the mileage standards for automobiles would save hundreds of millions or tens of millions of gallons of gasoline barrels of gasoline we do situation and we did it all by the way and no one complained even even the automobile company said it was all right even the automobile companies agreed because they know they've got to compete with foreign companies that are buy or build a more fuel efficient cars and there are no that they have to compete with electric cars we've proposed that we have electric charges stations we want to go to electric automobiles Well guess what you've got a place you can charge might go on and on I'm not going to do it but my point is I'm going to be laying out a major speech in detail by the end of the month on my specific pieces of the environment we need environmental red revolution I said back in 1987 on the floor speech when they passed one of my bills on this I said we have an X. a stench a threat we are in a situation where if we don't act quickly we're going to basically lose almost everything we have. And that's exactly the case it's even more urgent now we do need we do need to finish this green revolution in a way that's rational we can do it afford it and get it done now and so folks there's so much we can do that in our allows us to be in a position to be able to do it because of a fair tax structure and eliminate an awful lot of these loopholes Lastly and rather than keep you much longer and the poor guy standing by the open he's going to he's going to get there is I don't know man is going to perspire him very badly if I don't get. But here's the deal folks you know I am I'm always told that I'm an optimist Well I am an optimist and you know I'm more optimistic today about the prospects for the United States of America than I have been since I got elected as a 29 year old kid of the Senate not only not to be sworn in when I got elected and the reason I say that is look at who we are it's about time we remember who the devil we are this is the United States of America where in a situation where we have more great research universities out of which every major breakthrough in the last 20 years has come and you own those great research universities there monetize by corporations is a good thing but they come out of that basic research comes out of these great research universities then all the rest of the world combined all the rest of the wall combined Secondly we're in a situation where we not only have the most powerful military in history the world we in fact have led the world in the past up till now by the example of our power not the not not see me not by the power of our not by the example of our power but the but the power of our example that's why the rest of the world repaired us that's why they're walking away now we're embracing dictators the Prez's embracing oligarchy the president is in the in the business of calling his his good friend Lattimer Putin in these private calls he stands before the world and says No I have to trust my friend paraphrasing my friend Putin here in front of the G. 8 here that he is he says he didn't do anything about interfere in our elections it's happening right now and what's happened he's poking a finger No I have all of our allies as well so it's our example that we have stood for in the past that is allowed the world to unite in the greatest the literally not figure the greatest alliances in human history and that's what's kept the peace the last 6070 years Lastly I'd say that look we also have the most productive workers in the world the American worker is 433 times productive as workers in Asia. That doesn't mean for I don't want to see people Asia do well that's fine but we can't we don't have to take a backseat to anybody and we have to go as I said we're so well positioned in this nation to be able to seize hold of the opportunities of lead in the 21st century I did there's no reason why we can't own the 21st century where basically it is you know if I can go on but I won't the point is let's remember who we are this is the United States of America anything we've set our mind to we have never failed to accomplish we have never failed to accomplish you know we all had to or grade school the kids still do it now they'll read about John Kennedy's speech about why they go to the moon and why that was a subject of a great speech he made water but he can quote parts of it the one part I fact at the time and now think is the most precious thing he's ever said he said we're doing this because quote we refuse to postpone I refuse to postpone any longer the possibilities for this country and we have to end it now thank you so much straight Thank you folks thank you get a chance to talk about a lot more why don't I take some questions thank you tell me I can take some credit I'm going to give you a microphone.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?460665-1\/joe-biden-hampton-hampshire","Summary":"Former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, made a campaign stop in Hampton, New Hampshire at the Community Oven, a local pizza parlor.","Source":"460665-1","Type":"Speech"}

IT EXPANDED HEALTH CARE TO 20 MILLION AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] I AM STUDYING HEALTH QUALITY. JOE BIDEN BELIEVES THAT HIGH-QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE. HE FIGHTS FOR ALL OF US, AND HE NEEDS OUR HELP BY VOTING FOR HIM IN THIS ELECTION. IT WILL TAKE ALL OF US, A REAL GRASSROOTS EFFORT AND HARD WORK TO GET JOE BIDEN ELECT TO DO.

BORN IN THE USA, BORN IN THE USA. GOT IN A LITTLE HOMETOWN JAM, SO THEY PUT A RIFLE IN MY HAND. SENT ME OFF TO A FOREIGN LAND, TO GO AND KILL THE YELLOW MAN. BORN IN THE USA, I WAS BORN IN THE USA.

BORN IN THE USA, I WAS , WE ARE WAITING FOR JOE BIDEN TO ENTER THE STAGE AT PHILADELPHIA. HE ENTERED THE RACE IN APRIL AND HAS HELD CAMPAIGN EVENTS. ACCORDING TO HIS CAMPAIGN, THIS WILL FOCUS ON HIS VISION FOR UNIFYING AMERICA WITH RESPECTIVE LEADERSHIP AND IF I'D LEADERSHIP AT HOME. THIS IS LIVE COVERAGE ON C-SPAN. (music) (music) (music) IN 1787 THE FIRST WORDS OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION WORLDS WRITTEN. WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES. IT WAS A STATEMENT OF UNITY, OF PURPOSE, OF COMING TOGETHER. WE BOUND OURSELVES TOGETHER AS ONE PEOPLE, AND ONE NATION, ONE AMERICA. UNTIL THAT A PROBABLE MOMENT, THIS RAGTAG NATION HAS DARED TO BREAK FROM THE MOST POWERFUL EMPIRE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND EMBARK ON ITS JOURNEY TO BECOME THE GREATEST NATION THIS PLANET HAS EVER SEEN. TODAY, WE SEE SO MUCH DIVISION, SO MUCH ANGER, OUR POLITICIANS HAVE BECOME SO PAID, SO PERSONAL, SO NEGATIVE, IT IS AS IF WE CANNOT HELP OURSELVES. WE NEED TO HELP ONE ANOTHER, TO REACH THROUGH, TO BECOME AGAIN OUR BEST SELF. THAT IS WHY JOE IS RUNNING, THAT IS WHY WE ARE GOING TO PHILADELPHIA. [CHEERING] WE NEED TO LISTEN OTHER , LISTEN TO ONE ANOTHER, WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER, RESPECT ONE ANOTHER, TO COME TOGETHER ONCE AGAIN BE MORE AMERICA. WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] WOW. PHILADELPHIA. IT IS SO GREAT TO BE HOME. AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW, I GREW UP RIGHT BACK THERE. [APPLAUSE] EVERY DAY, EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND, MY SISTER AND I WOULD PILE INTO OUR FAMILY STATION WAGON AND COME UP TO THE BRIDGE TO GO IN SEE MY GRANDPARENTS IN SOUTHERN JERSEY. [CHEERING] MY SUMMERS WERE SPENT WATCHING THE PHILLIES WITH MY DAD. [CHEERING] I WATCHED THE PARADE AND TOOK CLASS TRIPS TO THE PLANETARIUM, THE BENTON THE WILLIAMS HOUSE, AND THE LIBERTY BELL. [CHEERING] I RAN THE BROAD STREET 10 MILER AND FOREVER, FLY EAGLES, FLY. SO I CAN SAY THIS CITY IS PART OF WHO I AM, AND NO MATTER WHERE I GO, OR WHERE I AM, I WILL ALWAYS AND FOREVER BE A PHILLY GIRL. [APPLAUSE] OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, SO MANY OF YOU HAVE COME UP TO ME AT A BANK, AND AIRPORTS, IN THE GROCERY STORE, AND EVEN ON THE STREET AND SAID THE SAME THING. PLEASE TELL JOE HE HAS TO RUN. [APPLAUSE] PEOPLE HAVE SAID, THAT THEY MISSED HIS STATEMENT SHIP, HIS ABILITY TO FIND COMMON GROUND. THEY MISSED HIS DIPLOMACY, AND HIS EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH OUR ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] THEY MISSED HIS COURAGE TO CONFRONT ISSUES THAT MATTER WHEN NO ONE ELSE SEEMS TO CARE. LIKE, HIS LIFESAVING WORK ON THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] IT IS NOT JUST THAT THEY MISSED HIS LEADERSHIP, THEY MISSED HIS KINDNESS, THE WAY HE INSPIRES US TO KEEP BELIEVING THAT THE BEST THINGS ARE AHEAD OF US. [APPLAUSE] HIS ABILITY TO FACE TRAGEDY, AND NEVER GIVE IN OR UP. HIS CHARACTER, HIS LOVE OF OUR NATION. AGAIN AND AGAIN, PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME, JOE IS THE ONE WHO CAN MOVE US FORWARD. JOE IS THE ONE WHO CAN BRING US TOGETHER. WE NEED HIM. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT? I AGREE. I MISS THAT FEELING OF HOPE, AND OPTIMISM. YOU KNOW WHAT? TODAY WE BEGIN TO RESTORE THAT FEELING. [APPLAUSE] THIS MOMENT DEFINES WHO WE ARE. IT IS A MOMENT THAT WE NEED TO HEAR YOUR VOICES, A MOMENT WHEN WE NEED LEADERS WITH VISION, AND CHARACTER. IT IS A MOMENT FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN BRING US TOGETHER, A MOMENT FOR JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE STARTING AN ENORMOUS JOURNEY TODAY, THE BIDEN FAMILY IS READY. WE WILL DO THIS, AS WE ALWAYS HAVE, AS A FAMILY. WE KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU ARE WITH US TOO. [APPLAUSE] WE KNOW THAT EVERY PERSON WHO TOLD ME THAT THEY WANTED JOE TO RUN WILL DO THEIR PART. YOU ARE GOING TO TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS, TEXT YOUR FRIENDS, KNOCK ON DOORS, GET THEM TO THE POLLS. WE NEED YOU. [APPLAUSE] ALL OF THOSE LITTLE THINGS ADD UP. TOGETHER, WE WILL BUILD THIS MOVEMENT, AND TOGETHER WE WILL WIN. [APPLAUSE] FOR AS LONG AS I HAVE KNOWN HIM, JOE HAS NEVER GIVEN UP, NEVER FAILED TO SEE THE POSSIBILITY, AND NEVER HAD ANY DOUBTS ON WHO HE IS FIGHTING FOR. AS LONG AS HE HAS THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING THIS NATION, I KNOW, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, THAT HE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR YOU EVERY DAY, SO LET US DO THIS. [APPLAUSE] PLEASE WELCOME, MY HUSBAND, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERING] (music) [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING \"JOE\"] (music) THANK YOU. [CHEERING] EVERYONE KNOWS THAT JILL IS A PHILADELPHIA GIRL. SHE LOVES THE CITY, I DO TOO. I HAVE TO SAY THIS, BECAUSE WHEN I DIE, PHILADELPHIA WILL BE WRITTEN ON MY HEART. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, I THINK SHE MADE A GREAT SECOND LADY AND SHE WILL MAKE ONE HECK OF A FIRST LADY. [APPLAUSE] FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS I HAVE BEEN ALL ACROSS AMERICA. TODAY, PHILADELPHIA. THIS IS JUST GETTING STARTED. NO ONE IS GOING TO WORK LONGER, CAMPAIGN HARDER TO WIN YOUR HEARTS, TRUST, AND SUPPORT. [APPLAUSE] PICK UP YOUR PHONE, NOW. SEND A TEXT TO , WITH THE WORD UNITED TO THE NUMBER 30330. THAT IS UNITED TO 30330. EITHER WAY. YOU'VE GOT IT. LOOK, A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK WHY WE BEGIN THIS JOURNEY IN THIS PLACE. LET IT GO. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT. [APPLAUSE] I MADE A PLEDGE THAT YOU WILL NOT HEAR ME SPEAK ILL OF THE OTHER DEMOCRATS. [APPLAUSE] IN THE LITERAL SENSE, THIS WAS THE BIRTHPLACE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. IT WAS HERE, THE FACT IS TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WERE WRITTEN HERE. 17 76, THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. THAT , THESE WORDS ARE THE AMERICAN CREED. EQUITY, FAIRNESS, DECENTLY, AMERICA HELD UP THAT PROMISE FOR MOST OF THE PEOPLE MOST OF THE TIME. WE WERE BORN OF THE IDEA THAT EVERY SINGLE, SOLITARY PERSON SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING THEY CANNOT DO IF THEY WORK AT IT. [APPLAUSE] AN EIGHT , IN 1787, THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, WE THE PEOPLE. THIS WORD CHANGED EVERYTHING. CONGRESS REPRESENTS THE PEOPLE NOT THE GOVERNMENT. FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO CRITICIZE THE GOVERNMENT, ALL PROTECTED. WE BECAME THE MODEL FOR THE WORLD. BOTH DOCUMENTS THERE IS A SINGULAR WORD. WE. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. WE, THE PEOPLE. BOTH WERE STATEMENTS OF A COMMON PURPOSE. A PURPOSE OF ONE PEOPLE, ONE NATION. OUR CONSTITUTION DOESN'T BEGIN WITH THE PHRASE WE THE DEMOCRATS, WE THE REPUBLICANS. IT DOESN'T BEGIN WITH THE PHRASE WE, THE DONORS. IT BEGAN WITH THE PHRASE THAT STANDS FOR WALK , WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. REMEMBER THAT. I DO MORE THAN ANY TIME OF OUR CAREER. OUR POLITICS HAVE BECOME SO ANGRY. AND SO UNPRODUCTIVE, INSTEAD OF DEBATING WE DEMONIZE. INSTEAD OF QUESTIONING JUDGMENT WE QUESTION THEIR MOTIVES. INSTEAD OF LISTENING, WE SHOUT. WE LOOK TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS. BUT, NO MORE. [APPLAUSE] THIS POLITICS IS PULLING US APART AND RIPPING THIS COUNTRY APART AT THE SEAMS. POLITICS IN TODAY TRAFFICS IN DIVISION AND OUR PRESIDENT IS THE DIVIDER IN CHIEF. HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE, FAR FROM IT. HE PRACTICES THE WORST POLITICS THAT SCAPEGOATS AND DEMONIZES. HE HOLDS OUT THE OTHERS AS A SOURCE OF ALL OUR PROBLEMS. THE IMMIGRANTS, MUSLIMS, ANYONE DIFFERENT IN CREED AND COLOR. THAT HAS BEEN A SCHEME USED BY POLITICIANS FOR DECADES. IT COMES AT A GIGANTIC COST. IT WEAKENS US, DISTRACTS US AND DIVIDES US. IT CAUSES US TO LOSE CREDIBILITY AROUND THE WORLD. IT SOLVES NOTHING. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. I ABSOLUTELY REJECT IT. [APPLAUSE] IN THIS COUNTRY WE ARE ALL TOGETHER IN THIS GREAT EXPERIMENT FOR EQUALITY AND DECENCY. WE HAVE NOT LIVED UP TO IT, BUT WE HAVE NOT GIVEN UP ON IT. EVERYONE , THAT IS WHY WE ARE A BEACON OF HOPE. THAT IS WHY THE WORLD HAS ALWAYS LOOKED AT US, UNLESS WE HAVE BURNED SOMETHING. AMERICA IS UNIQUE IN ALL OF THE WORLD. AMERICA IS AN IDEA, AN IDEA IS STRONGER THAN ANY ARMIES, BIGGER THAN ANY OCEAN, MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY DICTATOR IN CHINA. IT OFFERS HOPE TO THE DYING, THE POOR, THE HUNGRY MASSES. IT WAS WRITTEN ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. WE SEEM TO HAVE GIVEN UP ON IT. AMERICA GUARANTEES EVERYONE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. AMERICA GIVES HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT WE BELIEVE, AND THAT IS WHO WE ARE. I BELIEVE AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN SPECIAL. AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN BEST WHEN IT HAS ACTED AS ONE AMERICA. ONE AMERICA MIGHT BE A SIMPLE MOTION, DOES , IT DOES NOT MAKE IT ANY LESS PROFOUND. IT HAS TO COME TOGETHER. WE STARTED THIS CAMPAIGN, I SAID I WAS RUNNING FOR THREE REASONS. THE FIRST IS TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THE NATION. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS NATION. THE THIRD, TO UNITE THIS NATION. ONE AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW SOME OF THE REALLY SMART FOLKS SAID THAT DEMOCRATS DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT UNITY. THE DEMOCRATS ARE SO ANGRY, THE ANGRIER THAT CANDIDATE COULD BE THE BETTER CHANCE TO WIN THE NOMINATION. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT. I BELIEVE DEMOCRATS WANT TO UNIFY THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , IF AMERICA WANTS TO ADD MORE DIVISIONS, TO DEMONIZE YOUR OPPONENT, THEY HAVE GOT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] I AM NOT TAKING THE COUNTRY BACK TO A PAST THAT NEVER WAS, BUT A FUTURE THAT FILLED ITS FULL POTENTIAL. PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT BIDEN DOES NOT GET IT, HE CANNOT WORK WITH REPUBLICANS ANYMORE, THAT IS NOT THE WAY IT WORKS. I'M GOING TO SAY SOME THING OUTRAGEOUS. I KNOW HOW TO MAKE GOVERNMENT WORK. [APPLAUSE] NOT BECAUSE I AM TALKED OR TWEETED ABOUT IT, BUT BECAUSE I HAVE DONE IT. I HELPED MAKE GOVERNMENT WORK. I CAN DO THAT AGAIN AND HERE IS HOW. COMPROMISE IT SELF IS NOT A DIRTY WORD. CONSENSUS IS NOT A WEAKENSS, IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT. IT WAS DESIGNED IN THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES CONSENSUS. I DIDN'T WHEN I WAS A SENATOR. IT WAS WHAT I DID AS A VICE PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, I AM GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE MATTERS THAT MATTER MOST, CIVIL LIBERTIES, VOTING RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. A CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY THAT WILL SAVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHERE THERE IS ONLY A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK WILL DO. WE HAVE TO ASK REPUBLICANS TO ASK , TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT. WE HAVE TO PASS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. [APPLAUSE] WHICH REMINDS ME, WE NEED TO SAY SOMETHING THAT WE DO NOT OFTEN SAY ENOUGH AS A NATION. BARACK OBAMA WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN. [APPLAUSE] HE IS A PRESIDENT THAT ARE CHILDREN DEAD AND , OUR C HILDREN DID AND SHOULD LOOK UP TO. [APPLAUSE] OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO IT, IT WAS DONE BY BARACK OBAMA WITHOUT A SINGLE REPUBLICAN VOTE. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW HOW TO GO TOE TO TOE WITH THE GOP, BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE, AND IT CANNOT BE ON EVERY SINGLE ISSUE. LOOK AT THE RECOVERY ACT. THE CORNERSTONE OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT IS A BIG REASON THAT WE HAVE 10 YEARS OF UNINTERRUPTED ECONOMIC GROWTH. [APPLAUSE] WE NEEDED REPUBLICANS TO GET IT PASSED. IT WAS MY JOB TO FIND THEM, PERSUADE THEM. I DID, THEY DID, AND THE COUNTRY WAS BETTER THAN EVER. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN , THOSE ARE THE FACTS, NOT THE ALTERNATIVE FACTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS HURTING THE ECONOMY, , INHERITED THE ECONOMY FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] THE CREPERIE ACT , THE RECOVERY ACT SAVED THE STATES. WE HAVE TO GET THE WORK DONE, WE HAD TO BRING REPUBLICANS A WRONG , ALONG BECAUSE IF WE HAD NOT DONE IT WE WOULD HAVE HAD ANOTHER GREAT DEPRESSION. SO, FOLKS WORKING TOGETHER MATTERS. IT MATTERS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT GOVERNMENT TO WORK. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT IT CANNOT BE DONE. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THIS. THE COUNTRY IS SICK OF DIVISION. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE SICK OF THE FIGHTING. THEY ARE SICK OF THE BEHAVIOR. ALL THEY WANT IS FOR THEIR PRESIDENT, SENATORS, AND REPRESENTATIVES TO DO THEIR JOBS. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, ABOVE ALL, TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO MEASURES HIS OR HER DAYS I THE PEOPLE HE BRINGS TOGETHER , BY THE PEOPLE HE BRINGS TOGETHER RATHER THAN THE DIVISION THAT HE SOWS. YOU KNOW THERE IS SERIOUS WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE, BUT IT IS NOT BEING DONE BY A PRESIDENT WHO WAKES UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND WAKES THE WORLD LIKE THE GUY WITH THE WHISTLE BACK THERE. HIS CLINICAL OPPONENTS KNOW HIS PERSONAL GRIEVANCES. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS NOT WAITING PERIOD CHINA IS BUILDING 5G, AND MASTERING AI. THEY ARE REWRITING THE RULES OF THE INTERNET. THEY ARE MOVING INTO AREAS THAT SHOULD NOT BE ABANDONED BY US. THE REST OF THE WORLD HAS NOT GIVEN UP ON THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORDS. THEY ARE PUSHING IT. [APPLAUSE] THE GREATEST CHALLENGE WE FACE IN THE FUTURE TECHNOLOGY, CLEAN ENERGY, A WARMING PLANET. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING THAT BUILDING A WALL CAN ADDRESS IN ANY OF THIS. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED THE 21ST STEP , CENTURY STRATEGY FOR AMERICA. EVERYTHING DONALD TRUMP USES IS OUT OF THE PAST. WE HAVE TO GET FOCUSED. FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE. THE ONLY WAY WE WILL MAKE THAT IS TO GIVE PEOPLE THE EDUCATION THEY NEED IN THE 21ST CENTURY. ANY COUNTRY THAT OUT EDUCATES US WILL OUTCOMPETE US. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHY I WILL GIVE FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. [APPLAUSE] THEY CAN DO SO MUCH MORE. WE KNOW WE HAVE TO. SO I WILL TRY TO FIX IT. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING \"WE WANT JOE\"] PARENTS WHO COULD NOT AFFORD TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE. NOW WE NEED TO GO TO THIS. WE SHOULD NOT TEAR IT DOWN. TO ME, EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE BEST WAY TO GET HEALTH CARE. [APPLAUSE] IT IS THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUILD NOT ONLY GREENER ROADS AND HIGHWAYS, BUT TWEEDY'S , BUT TREATIES. WE CAN DO IT MORE RATIONALLY. WE CAN DO A LOT. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO PROTECT THE NATION FROM CYBER ATTACKS. WE NEED SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY ACROSS THOSE SAME LINES. YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, AND THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING. LET US START , STOP FIGHTING AND START INKING. WE CAN ONLY DO IT TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS NOT MUCH TIME LEFT, WE NEED A GREEN ENERGY REVOLUTION AND WE NEED IT NOW. WE NEED TO START NOW. [APPLAUSE] PEOPLE SAY JOBS AND GREEN ENERGY DO NOT GO TOGETHER, BUT THEY DO. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET IT DONE. EVEN NOW, SOME OF THOSE SPECIAL INTERESTS ARE REALIZING, THE GAS, OIL INDUSTRY, THEY ARE SAYING MR. PRESIDENT , THEY SAY WE ARE GOING TO BE UNDERWATER. NOT A JOKE. THE OIL INDUSTRY SAID , AGREED. THEY DID NOT EVEN , WHO IS HE TRYING TO PLEASE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS GOING TO LEAD. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO GET THINGS DONE. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO ACCOMPLISH TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE FIRST AND MOST IN THIRD , IMPORTANT THING, BEAT FROM. , TRUMP.\/ [APPLAUSE] EVERYTHING I JUST SAID, EDUCATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING HOPE FOR AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT SHOULD BE DONE. THE PEOPLE ARE NOT DIVIDED. THAT CAP , GAP IS GIVING RIDE TO THE WORST ELEMENTS ON EITHER SIDE. PEOPLE COME OUT FROM UNDER ROCKS AND SAY IT WOULD NOT BE AS BAD AS TWO YEARS AGO. OUR DEMOCRACY IS A MISTAKE. NO MORE. OUR DEMOCRACY IS REAL. I AM NOT JOKING. THERE ARE SO MANY DIVISIONS. THEY ARE UNDERCUTTING EVERYTHING THAT WAS DESIGNED. ALL OF THIS IN ORDER TO SOLIDIFY HIS BASE AND EXPAND HIS POWER. JUST THINK ABOUT IT. THE ATTACKS ON THE FREE PRESS, IT IS NOTHING THAT IS CENTS. THEY ARE TIRED , TYRANTS ARE USING THE SAME LANGUAGE, AND HE USED IT TO SOLIDIFY HIS OWN POWER. HE IS SAYING YOU CANNOT TRUST BECAUSE , I AM SAYING THAT CANNOT BE AMERICA. FOLKS, IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ENGAGE IN OVERSIGHT, PLACING HIM A BUT OF THE LAW. BY THE WAY, WITHOUT A WHIMPER FROM THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER. [BOOING] [APPLAUSE] THEY UNDERMINED OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD. EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE DONE HAS MADE AMERICA AMERICA. ARE WE A NATION THAT BELIEVES THERE IS A MORAL PRIVILEGE AND ENCOURAGE THOSE LIKE THE NAZIS. TRUMP DOES. ARE WE A NATION WHO BELIEVES WE SHOULD TEAR CHILDREN FROM THE ARMS OF PARENTS. WE DO NOT. BUT TRUMP DOES. EVERY DAY WE ARE REMINDED ABOUT WHAT THESE ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. EVERY DAY WE ARE REMINDED THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. WE HAVE TO EARN IT. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE ONLY 140 MILES FROM GETTYSBURG. PERHAPS ONE OF THEM BOAST , IN THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS LINCOLN HAD A MESSAGE FOR THE LIVING. HE SAID THIS WILL BE DEDICATED TO THE GREAT MEN. BY THE GOVERNMENT OF, AND BY THE PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] THIS HAS GONE DOWN TO EVERY GENERATION OF AMERICANS. IT IS THE BEST ABOVE ALL OTHERS, THAT GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS , WE WILL NOT LET THE GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE PERISH. WILL YOU LET THAT HAPPEN? I WILL NOT, YOU WILL NOT. [APPLAUSE] IT WILL NOT BE FINISHED ON MY WATCH, OR YOURS. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE FACING THE BIGGEST THREAT ANY OF US HAS FACED. WE HAVE NEVER HAD A FUTURE THAT IS MORE PROMISING. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE BETTER THAN HE IS. WE NEED TO BE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. OTHER WORLD LEADERS KNOW IT. BUT NOT , BUT NOT US. OUR WORKFORCE IS THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE. WE HAVE THE BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESOURCES IN THIS STUDY, IN THIS STATE , THIS CITY AND THIS STATE THEY AND ALL OF THE WORLD COMBINED. [APPLAUSE] NO OTHER NATION CAN MATCH US. IF WE CAN LEAD BY OUR EXAMPLE, THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF. WE WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN. WE WILL LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE STAND FOR. UNITY OVER DIVISION. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER.

MY BACKGROUND IS, I HAVE THINGS IN ECONOMICS, I COULD MAKE THE CASE FOR FREE TRADE USING WINE AND LEMON. I LEARNED A VALUABLE LESSON WHEN I GOT TO CONGRESS. A FRIEND OF MINE CALLED ME. CLASSIC REPUBLICAN LIBERAL FREE TRADER. HE CALLED ME AND SAID I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM, HE SAID SELLING COTTON INTO PAKISTAN.'S ORDER BOOK WENT TO 0. HE CALLED THEM AND SAID WHY AREN'T YOU BUYING MY COTTON? HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT SELL IT TO THEM AT TWO DOLLARS PER POUND. I FORGET THE NUMBER BUT IT WAS LESS THAN THE RAW COST FOR COTTON IN THE U.S. THE RAW COST FOR COTTON IN THE U.S. HE SAID WELL THEY CAN DO THAT THEY CALLED THE UFT R WHICH IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WE WANT TO MAKE A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT. THEY WERE DOING THIS WITH IN VIOLATION OF AGREEMENT. THEY CALLED THE 24 HOURS LATER AND SAID WE ARE SORRY WE CAN'T HELP YOU. THE GUY SAYS WHY NOT. THEY WILL HAVE TO RUN DOWN A CHECKLIST IN THE FIRST CALL THEY MADE WAS THE STATE DEPARTMENT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS WE HAVE BIGGER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT. IS THAT FREE TRADE? IS THAT FAIR TRADE? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS FREE TRADE IS YOU DON'T TOUCH MY STUFF I DON'T TOUCH YOUR STUFF LET'S GO. THERE'S NO SUBSIDIES, THERE'S NO TARIFFS, LET'S JUST DO THIS, OKAY? LAST TIME I CHECKED THAT ONLY EXISTS, TRULY IN ONE PLACE IN THE WHOLE WORLD, THAT'S WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE 50 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. JIM IS A GREAT-GREAT FRIEND, I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG TIME. AND FORMER MAYOR BILL, ARE YOU HERE BILL? ALL RIGHT MAYOR, OKAY. [ APPLAUSE ] AND ROXANNE. ROXANNE? I LOVE YOU. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, THAT OLD EXPRESSION, GOD MADE MAN THEN HE MADE SOME FIREFIGHTERS. THING GOD. THEY ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE I KNOW WHO WOULD RUN INTO FIRES. I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE IN WASHINGTON AND OTHER PLACES. THEY'VE ENDORSED ME AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THEM. FIREFIGHTERS, THEY HAVE NOT ONLY SAVED MY LIFE, THEY GAVE ME ABOUT A 30% CHANCE OF LIVING THEY GOT ME DOWN. THEY BROUGHT ME TO A NEUROSURGEON FOR A 13 HOUR OPERATION IN THE MIDDLE OF A SNOWSTORM AND SAVED MY LIFE. SO MANY OF YOU WERE NICE TO ME AFTER I WAS ELECTED THE FIRST TIME. THE JAWS OF LIFE FREED MY TWO BOYS, MY WIFE WAS CHRISTMAS SHOPPING, I LOST MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER. THE JAWS OF LIFE GOT THEM TO THE HOSPITAL IN TIME AND SAVED THEM. I WAS DOWN AND DEPRESSED ONE DAY, I WAS AT MY HOME. THEY WENT IN. IT WAS TERRIBLE. THEY GOT MY WIFE OUT. SHE SAID THEY SAVED OUR CAT. IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK, IT REALLY IS. NOW WE ARE BOTH IN TOWN TODAY. OR AT LEAST IN THE STATE TODAY. IT WASN'T PLANNED THAT WAY BUT I HOPE THAT TRUMPS PRESIDENTS, THERE'S MAY BE A CLARIFYING MOMENT FOR US ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] AMERICA'S FARMERS HAVE BEEN CRUSHED BY THE TARIFFS IN CHINA AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE IN IOWA. HE THINKS HE'S BEING TOUGH, HE'S BEING TOUGH. IF HE IS BEING TOUGH WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS FEELING THE PAIN, HOW MANY ACROSS THE NATION HAD THE PROSPECTS OF LOSING THEIR BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THESE TRUMP TARIFFS ? HOW MANY TIMES HAVE THEY GONE TO BED STANDING AT THE CEILING WONDERING WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OR IF THEY WOULD MAKE IT? HOW ABOUT MANUFACTURING? TRUMPS TARIFFS AND TRADE WARS, THAT'S HARD A LOT OF MANUFACTURERS. WITHIN THE MIDST OF THIS. ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS, YOU KNOW I WAS BLAMED FOR PUSHING THE BAILOUT OF GENERAL MOTORS. BUT THAT WAS ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE RESCUE OF THE AMERICAN AUTO INDUSTRY. [ APPLAUSE ] WE KNEW THAT IT MEANT MILLIONS OF JOBS IN THE AUTOMOBILE COMPANIES AND SUPPLY CHAINS, IT ALSO MEANT THE PRIDE OF THE NATION WAS AT STAKE AS WELL. NOW, WATCHING TRUMP DESTROY THE INDUSTRY THAT THE PRESIDENT HELPED SAVE HIS DISCOURAGING. I DON'T THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT REALLY GETS THE BASICS . HE THINKS THAT THESE TARIFFS ARE BEING PAID BY CHINA JUST LIKE HE THINKS MEXICO IS BUILDING THE WALL. [ APPLAUSE ] JOE, THE KIND. I KEEP THINKING OF MY MOTHER. ANYWAY. CHINA IS MAKING MASSIVE INVESTMENTS INTO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AS WELL AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, FIVE AS WELL AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, 5G, WHILE HE IS TWEETING THEY AREN'T SITTING STILL, NO OTHER COUNTRY IS. THEY ARE MOVING. WHILE HE'S NAME-CALLING THEY ARE BUILDING ROADS AND BRIDGES AND HIGH-SPEED RAILS. TRUMP IS PURSUING DAMAGE AND THIS ERRATIC WAR ON TRADE WITHOUT A REAL STRATEGY. THAT IS THE PART THAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST. CHINA'S POSITIONING THEMSELVES TO LEAD THE WORLD IN RENEWABLE ENERGY. IT IS JUST BIZARRE, WHILE CHINA IS PRESSING THEIR ADVANTAGE ALL OVER THE WORLD, WE NEED THE REST OF THE WORLD TO DEAL WITH US DEALING WITH CHINA AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN THE WESTERN PART OF THEIR COUNTRY I MEAN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. BUT NOTHING IS SET. AND SO YOU BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT CHINA. KEEP FOLLOWING A PATH THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS US ON. IF WE DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE AT HOME, IF WE STAND UP FOR AMERICA'S INTEREST, IF WE INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE, WITH OUR LIVES AND OUR VALUES, WITH THE WORK OF OUR PARTNERS, WE COULD OUTCOMPETE ANYONE IN THE WORLD. NOBODY ELSE COULD COMPETE WITH US. THEY CAN'T. THAT'S NOT THE PROGRAM. THEY REALLY CAN'T. I HAVE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN WORKERS. WE ARE THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE, OUR INGENUITY AND OUR RESEARCH AND UNIVERSITIES. WE HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST UNIVERSITIES. HERE WE ARE, EVERY MAJOR NEW INITIATIVE. WE OWN THEM, WE HAVE THESE GREAT LABS. THEY ARE OWNED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATES IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED. WE SHOULD ON THE 21st CENTURY, LET'S INVEST IN AMERICA. THAT'S WHY , [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHY PROPOSE TO RESTORE INITIATIVES IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, CUTTING- EDGE INFRASTRUCTURE, A WORKFORCE THAT WILL HELP US WORK AND COMPETE. WE MAKE THIS INVESTMENT AND WE COULD CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS, IT'S NOT INCONSISTENT WITH WHO WE ARE. I REALLY MEAN IT. THINK OF WHAT WE CAN DO. LET'S BUILD THE UNITED FRONT OF OUR EYE LIES WHO CHALLENGE THEIR ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR. TRUMP IS ATTACKING THE VERY PARTNERS WE NEED TO DEAL WITH CHINA. WE NEED TO RALLY HALF OF THE WORLD ECONOMY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR CHEATING. SPEAKING OUT ON THEIR REPRESSION. BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING? WE ARE ALIENATING THOSE ALLIES. WHAT ARE WE DOING? IT MAKES NO SENSE. AND LOOK, LET'S TIGHTEN UP OUR DEFENSES SO THAT AMERICAN COMPANIES DON'T HAVE TO KEEP GETTING AND GIVING AWAY TECHNOLOGY TO CHINA. AND HAVING IT STOLEN. THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. DURING THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WE GOT THEM TO CUT CYBER CUTS BUT NOW IT'S GOTTEN SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION. IT WAS REAL SIMPLE. WHEN THEY SAID THERE WAS AN ERROR IDENTIFICATION ZONE AND NO ONE COULD FLY TO THE SOUTH CHINA SEA I SAID WE AREN'T GOING TO PAY ATTENTION TO THESE. WE ARE GOING TO FLY THROUGH IT. WE FLEW B-52S THROUGH IT. THAT'S IT. YOU WANT TO STEAL OUR PROPERTY? YOU SAY YOU HAVE HALF OWNERSHIP AND ACCESS TO OUR PROPERTY? GUESS WHAT, YOU CAN'T TRADE HERE UNLESS YOU DO THE SAME INSTEAD OF PUT TARIFFS ON WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH THESE BUSINESSES. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO COOPERATE WHERE WE HAVE A COMMON INTEREST. THE CHINESE AGREED TO IT THE FIRST TIME TO LIMIT THEIR CARBON POLLUTION. WE HAVE TO REJOIN THE PARIS PEACE ACCORD. THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD, WHAT DID WE DO? WE STEPPED AWAY. MY LORD, YOU ALL KNOW THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CLIMATE CHANGE. I KNOW YOU ALL KNOW THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK, THERE'S A LOT MORE WE COULD DO ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND NUCLEAR WEAPON INITIATIVES WHERE THERE IS A COMMON INTEREST BUT TIME AND TIME AGAIN, IT ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, TRUMP MAKES THE WRONG CHOICES. HE'S MOTIVATED BY THE WRONG THINGS.'S DENIAL OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS IGNORANCE OF THE DEVASTATING LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF TARIFFS AND WE ARE GOING TO BANKRUPT THE FARM BELT. LOOK FOLKS, WE ARE SEEING DEVASTATING FLOODS, I NEED NOT TELL YOU, BEING IN FARMS AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE HEARTLAND RIGHT HERE IN DAVENPORT, I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. I CANCELED BECAUSE YOU HAD THIS GOD-AWFUL FLOODING EVENT. THERE WERE FLOODED STREETS, IT DISRUPTED LIVES AND BUSINESSES. RECORD FLOOD LEVELS, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DAMAGE AS WELL AS CLEANUP. DEVASTATION IN THE HEARTLAND, IT WOULD BE RECORD-BREAKING EVEN WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDING SUPPORT FOR FARMERS AND FARMERS WHO AREN'T ALONE. THE ECONOMY OF OUR CITIES AND SMALL TOWN RELIES ON BEING ABLE TO SELL THE CROPS AROUND THE WORLD. LOOK FOLKS, STILL, WHAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP? HE DENIES CLIMATE CHANGE. WHAT DID HE TELL PIERS MORGAN IN AN INTERVIEW RECENTLY? HE SAID WELL, WHETHER GOES BOTH WAYS. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DOES BUT WHETHER GOES BOTH WAYS . THIS REMINDS ME WHEN HE TWEETED IN THE WINTER. TWEET IN THE WINTER IT SAID, IT WAS COLD OUTSIDE, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CLIMATE CHANGE. AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, BLESS ME FATHER FOR I HAVE SINNED. HOW ABOUT WHEN HE SAID, NO GET THIS ONE. I WENT OUT AND HE SAID DEVASTATING FIRES IN CALIFORNIA, COUNTIES ALL ACROSS THE WEST, DEVASTATED, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PUT IN HARM'S WAY. WHAT DID HE SAY? HE SAID THOSE CALIFORNIA FIRES, THEY JUST NEED TO RAKE THEIR LEAVES. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT JOKING OR MAKING THIS UP. HE COULD BE A STAND UP COMIC IF THIS WEREN'T SO TRUE. LOOK, IF THIS WASN'T SO SERIOUS IT WOULD BE ANOTHER RICH GUY PLAYING APARTMENT IN MANHATTAN TWEETING ABOUT SCIENTISTS WHO DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, IT WOULDN'T MATTER, BUT HE IS THE PRESIDENT. [ APPLAUSE ] LOOK , WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO CONFRONT THIS CLIMATE CHANGE, I BLEED OUT THE DETAIL PLAN I LAID OUT A DETAILED PLAN. INSTEAD OF A PRESIDENT WHO GIVES THIS AWAY, GIVES $2.6 MILLION WORTH OF WAIVERS TO LET EXXON AND CHEVRON REFINERIES GET OUT OF USING RENEWABLE FUEL, WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL PARTNER WITH FARMERS AND RANCHERS, EXPANDING THE MARKET FOR ETHANOL AND THE NEXT GENERATION OF BIOFUEL. WE NEED TO INVEST IN THE CLEAN ENERGY INNOVATION, WE NEED TO BUILD CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF CHARGING STATIONS ACROSS AMERICA AND IN THE 21st CENTURY RAILROAD SYSTEM. WHAT ARE WE DOING? THINK ABOUT IT. I MEAN IT'S LIKE, PUTTING AMERICA ON THE COURSE OF BEING CLEAN AIR EFFICIENT. INSTEAD HE PULLED AMERICA OUT OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE, HE JUST TRIED TO MUSCLE THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO PREVENT HIM FROM DISCUSSING CLIMATE SCIENCE. BEFORE THE CONGRESS. HE THINKS THAT WINDMILLS CAUSE CANCER. I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP. I KNOW. ON APRIL 2 HE SAID, \"IF YOU'RE IN A WINDMILL, CONGRATULATION, YOUR HOUSE WENT DOWN 75% IN VALUE, AND THEY SAY THE NOISE CAUSES CANCER.\" LOOK, WE KNOW ABOUT CANCER, A LOT OF US. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO CANCER OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE? WHAT DO YOU DO? AFTER HE GOT ELECTED, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS JOINED TOGETHER, ALIENS OF DOLLARS OF RESEARCH, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF RESEARCH IN DEALING WITH CANCER ITSELF. THE FIRST THING WE DID. THE FIRST BUDGET HE PROPOSED, IT WAS TO CUT $10 MILLION. FOLKS, IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD DO IF WE INVESTED HALF OF THAT TAX CUT HE GAVE. EVEN A 10th OF IT, USING IT FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH TO DEAL WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH CANCER AND TO END IT AS WE KNOW IT, ALZHEIMER'S, DEALING WITH OBESITY, DEALING WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING. GOD ALMIGHTY, THIS IS ALL WITHIN OUR POWER. REMEMBER WHEN THE JUSTICE WAS ACHING SPEAKING ABOUT HEALTH AND TRYING TO DECIDE THAT THE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE ACT WAS IN ITS ENTIRETY, UNZIPPED CONSTITUTIONAL UNCONSTITUTIONAL. I CAMPAIGNED FOR OVER 16 DEMOCRATS. RUNNING FOR THE HOUSE, THE SENATE, THE STATE LEGISLATIVE BODIES, GUESS WHAT? I DID NOT HEAR ANY OF THEM TALKING ABOUT BEING AGAINST REPUBLICANS OR HEALTHCARE. ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY HAD ANOTHER CALL. THEY SAW THE LORD. HE APPEARED BEFORE THEM. THINK ABOUT IT. ALL THE SUDDEN EVERYBODY WAS FOR IT. NOW HE BARELY MENTIONS THE FACT THAT HE WANTS TO GUT IT OR GET RID OF IT. HE DOESN'T EVEN TWEET ABOUT IT ANYMORE. HERE KNOW THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL GIVE HIM THE SAME THRASHING THEY GAVE THE REPUBLICAN 2018 TRYING TO GET RID OF THE HEALTHCARE ACT. GUESS WHAT? I'VE BECOME THIS PARTY NOMINEE. I'M NOT GOING TO LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FORGET. DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR POTENTIAL FOR THESE CONDITIONS. I'M NOT GOING TO LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FORGET THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THEIR KID GETS TO STAY ON THE PARENTS PLAN UNTIL THEY ARE AGE 26. I WILL NOT LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FORGET IT IS BECAUSE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE GAINED HEALTHCARE. MORE THAN ONE THING. ONE MORE THING, WHAT AMAZES ME, THIS PRESIDENT ACTUALLY THINKS WALL STREET BUILT THIS COUNTRY. THEY DIDN'T. THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. ORDINARY, HARD-WORKING, NOT A JOKE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GIVEN HALF A CHANCE HAVE NEVER LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN. NOT ONCE. ALL THEY ASK FOR IS A SHOT. JUST A SHOT. I'M ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT MIDDLE CLASS AND I TELL YOU WHAT, I KNOW WHO BUILT THE COUNTRY AND I KNOW ONE MORE THING, THERE IS A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS WITH ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL STABILITY. WHENEVER THE COUNTRY GOES THROUGH A CRISIS IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT WE HAVE, THINGS BEGAN TO PRAY. THE FIRST TIME WE DON'T HAVE THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN AMERICA IT'S SHRINKING IN AMERICA. WE HAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE NOW, MANY OF YOU KNOW THEM AND THEY MIGHT BE SOME OF YOU, YOU GOT A BILL FOR $400, YOU DIDN'T ANTICIPATE, YOU WOULD KNOW HOW TO PAY IT. MY DAD USED TO SAY, JOEY REMEMBER WHEN WE MOVED, YOU'D THINK I CLIMBED OUT OF A COAL MINE WITH A WOOD BUCKET ON MY HEAD BUT WE MOVED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WORK AND BY THE WAY HE SAID BY THE WAY HE ABANDONED YOU. I WAS NINE YEARS OLD. I LEFT WITH MY DAD. I'M SO SORRY I DIDN'T STAY. BUT I WENT HOME EVERY SUMMER. I WENT BACK FOR CHRISTMAS AND EASTER. I TRIED. YELLOW YOU KNOW I SHOULDN'T GET STARTED. LOOK, THE TAX CUT HE PASSED. FOR MULTIMILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES. GUESS WHAT? WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, THAT'S GONE. IT'S GONE. LOOK, YOU REALIZE WHEN REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT THERE WERE ABOUT $800 BILLION IN CAST TAX EXPENDITURES, THINGS WE DON'T COLLECT TAXES ON. LOOPHOLES. GUESS WHAT, YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TODAY? $1 TRILLION, $400 BILLION, YOU CAN'T FIND ME AN ECONOMIST ANYWHERE IN THE STATE THAT WILL SAY THERE'S JUSTIFICATION SOCIAL POLITICALLY OR IN ANY ECONOMIC REGION FOR AT LEAST 500 ALIEN DOLLARS OF THAT MONEY. IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD DO. WE DON'T HAVE TO HURT ANYBODY, WE DON'T HAVE TO PUNISH ANYBODY INCLUDING THE RICH. BUT EVERYONE SHOULD START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHOULD I BECOME PRESIDENT. WE ARE GOING TO INVEST IN THE PEOPLE AND THE ECONOMY. WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF $100 BILLION IN TAX REFORM. THERE'S NO RATIONALE. I WILL BUILD THE ECONOMY THAT DOESN'T JUST REWARD WEALTH BUT I'M BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK. WORK. THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT IT. LOOK, I'VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST THE WEALTHY BUT THEY KNOW THEY DON'T NEED ANOTHER TAX BREAK. THEY KNOW WHAT. I'M LOOKING TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, AN ECONOMY THAT RESTORES THE DIGNITY OF WORK, HOW COULD YOU AS A PERSON BUSTING YOUR NECK OUT THERE IN YOUR JOBS, HOW COULD YOU HAVE DIGNITY IF YOU CAN'T PROVIDE FOR THE BASICS FOR YOUR FAMILY? FOR HEALTHCARE? FOR EDUCATION? FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BREATHING ROOM. MY DAD USED TO SAY, MIDDLE- CLASS, IT'S NOT BEING ABLE , THICK DID WELL ENOUGH THEY COULD GO TO SCHOOL AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. WHETHER IT WAS TRADE SCHOOL OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WHETHER IT WAS FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE. YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW, 65, 100 JOBS TODAY REQUIRES SOMETHING BEYOND A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE. THE FACT IS, I'VE SAID THIS MANY TIMES, WE COULD OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF THIS PRESIDENCY, I THINK WE COULD OVERCOME IT. A LOT OF DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE AND IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF HARD WORK BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF HE'S IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR EIGHT YEARS HE WILL FOREVER CHANGE AND FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE CHARACTER OF THE NATION. I REALLY MEAN THAT. THIS IS BEYOND THE ISSUES. I BELIEVE THAT TRUMP CLOSES THE FUNDAMENTAL THREAT FOR AMERICA. [ APPLAUSE ] THE CORE VALUES, WHAT WE STAND FOR, WHO WE ARE, WHAT WE BELIEVE, LET'S START WITH CHARLOTTESVILLE. I WOULD NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE THAT COMING AS A KID OUT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, I DID NOT THINK I WOULD SEE THAT URIC NEO-NAZIS LIGHTING TORCHES. HE SAW IT, THEIR CONTORTED FACES, FILLED WITH HATE. CHANTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC THREATS. THAT'S OKAY. THIS IS NOT A TRUMP RALLY. AND THESE FOLKS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS AS WELL AS BY THE KU KLUX KLAN. DECENT PEOPLE HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AGAINST HATE, WHAT HAPPENED? HE ASKED THE PRESIDENT WHAT HE THOUGHT. HE SAID THERE WERE FINE PEOPLE IN BOTH GROUPS. NO JOKE. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID. AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LOOK, LATER WHEN HE REALIZED WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WAS GETTING SOME HEAT. HE SAID THOSE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO MARCH TO PROTECT A STATUTE A CONFEDERATE STATUE. HE'S YET TO ACKNOWLEDGE OR APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT HE SAID. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING. VIOLENCES COMPLICITY, LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING, LOOK AT WHERE WE SEE, LOOKING AT THESE POLICIES TAKING KIDS FROM THEIR MOTHERS AND FATHERS PUTTING THEM LITERALLY, IN CAGES, THOUSANDS OF THEM. WHAT DOES THAT SAY? WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO THE WORLD? WHO WE ARE, FOLKS LOOK, THE PHRASE WE HOLD THESE WHO ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL. IT'S THE AMERICAN CREED, IT'S WHO WE ARE, IT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN. WE HAVE NOT ALWAYS LIVED UP TO IT THAT WE NEVER FULLY ABANDONED IT. WE NEVER STOP TRYING TO CREATE A MORE PERFECT UNION. IT IS THE AMERICAN CREED BUT TRUMP DOES NOT SEE IT THAT WAY. HE SAYS WHEN WE TALK THAT WAY IT MAKES US WEAK THAT HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT MAKES A STRONG. WHAT MAKES US STRONG AS A NATION IS OUR HONESTY, DECENCY, TREATING ONE WITH DIGNITY. I REALLY MEAN THAT. [ APPLAUSE ] DEMONIZING NO ONE. LET THE POOR, NOT THE MUSLIM, NOT THEM POWERLESS, NOT THE IMMIGRANTS, WE GIVE HATE NO SAFE HARBOR BUT NOW, IT'S BEEN GIVEN CREDIBILITY. PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE ROCKS AND SAYING AND DOING THINGS THAT NEVER WOULD BE ACCEPTED BEFORE. A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE BUT IT IS REAL. AND AGAIN, NOT A JOKE, OUR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING. LOOK, UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. WE ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THAT AND WE'VE ALWAYS KNOW THAT. DOES ANYONE IN THIS ROOM THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTANDS THAT? OKAY? LOOK EVERYWHERE WE TURN, IT'S CLEAR THAT DONALD TRUMP IS SHREDDING WHAT WE MOST BELIEVE. WE BELIEVE, I HAVE THE BELIEF THAT WE NEED TO RESTORE THE BASIC VALUES WE STAND FOR. WE ARE NOT LED BY JUST THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER BUT THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. THAT IS WHERE THE REST OF THE WORLD COMES TO US THAT'S WHY MANY PEOPLE FLOCK HERE. THAT IS WHY AMERICA IS AN IDEA. IT'S NOT A JOKE. IT'S THE MOST UNIQUE IDEA IN ALL OF HISTORY. AND IT IS BEING DAMAGED AROUND THE WORLD. TRUMP ATTENDED THE 75th ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY, THE MOST IMPORTANT SYMBOL IN THE WORLD OF THE IMPORTANCE OF AMERICAN ALLIANCES, IT WAS AFTER THAT WAR THAT MANY OF YOUR FATHERS AND MOTHERS AND OTHERS AND GRANDPARENTS GAVE THEIR LIVES. WHAT HAPPENED AFTER? WE DECIDED THAT WE WERE NO LONGER GOING TO ALLOW FOR THE ABUSE OF POWER FOR ANYONE NATION. SO THAT'S WHEN WE FORMED NATO SO THAT NO ONE NATION COULD ACT INDEPENDENTLY AND ABUSE POWER LIKE THIS HAPPEN BEFORE THROUGHOUT HISTORY IN EUROPE AT LEAST TWICE IN THAT CENTURY. MAN, YOU KNOW, WHAT HAS DONALD TRUMP DONE? DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID A FEW WORDS ABOUT NATO THIS TIME. THEY ARE COMPLETELY AGAINST EVERYTHING ELSE HE SAID AND DONE INCLUDING AN INTERVIEW HE MADE WITH FOX NEWS BEFORE HIS INJURES BEFORE HIS SPEECH. TO THREATEN TO LEAVE NATO. HE TALKED ABOUT THE OBSOLESCENCE OF IT, HE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE SAME REASON, THE WHOLE RATIONALE FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION. WAS FOR ONE NATION TO DOMINATE THAT REGION. WHAT HAS HAPPENED? THEY ARE THE ENEMY. THEY ARE THE ENEMY. DID HE DO ANYTHING THAT HE'S PREPARED TO SIGNAL HER WALK AWAY FROM THE THUGS AND DICTATORS THAT HE HAS EMBRACED ON THE WORLD STAGE? STANDING BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND TURNING TO A DICTATOR LIKE PUTIN AND SAYING I BELIEVE HIM RATHER THAN ALL OF OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES? NOT ONLY IS THIS UNBELIEVABLE BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS DOES TO OUR ALLIES WHO, IN FACT, SHARE INFORMATION WITH OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES? IF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS I DON'T BELIEVE THEM, MUELLER, IT JEOPARDIZES OUR SECURITY, IT'S NOT A JOKE. HE EMBRACES THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER WHO IS A THUG AND A MURDERER. HE HAD HIS UNCLES BRAINS BLOWN OUT. I'M NOT JOKING. AND BY THE WAY, I WAS PLEASED TO KNOW THAT HIS ALLIANCE WITH THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER, THEY THOUGHT THAT MAYBE I SHOULD NOT BE PRESIDENT. BY THE WAY, HE QUOTED IT. HE QUOTED HIM WHILE HE WAS THERE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, HE DID NOT DO ANY OF THE RIGHT THINGS INSTEAD OF THAT HE GOES UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE HE'S AT NORMANDY, HE TWEETS AN ATTACK ON THAT MIDLER? THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, WHO'S THERE WITH HIM AND NORMANDY? A STUNNING DISPLAY OF CHILDISHNESS THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WATCHED. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT AGAIN, IT WASN'T JUST WORLD LEADERS WHO ARE WATCHING, IT WAS ALL OF OUR FRIENDS AROUND THE WORLD, LISTENING TO WHAT HE WAS SAYING. LOOK, THE BEHAVIOR, THE CHARACTER OF A PRESIDENT MATTERS A LOT. IT MATTERS WHAT PRESIDENTS SAY. I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T SAY OFTEN ENOUGH, BARACK OBAMA WAS THE PRESIDENT OF EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER AND DECENCY. [ APPLAUSE ] WHEN HE WAS THE PRESIDENT OUR CHILDREN COULD AND DID LOOK UP TO. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE TURNED YOUR TELEVISION OFF SOMETIMES WHEN HE SPEAKS? I'M NOT JOKING. I KNOW THAT I MISSED THE DINNER THAT WAS HERE WHERE THE NOT LONG AGO I GUESS IT WAS LAST SUNDAY, BECAUSE MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL. HER BEST FRIEND IS SASHA OBAMA. THEY'VE BEEN TO SCHOOL TOGETHER THE WHOLE TIME. SO BARACK AND I AND THE WHOLE FAMILY, WE GOT TOGETHER AFTERWARD TO HAVE A LIGHT LUNCH OR DINNER FOR THE FAMILY. I WATCH HOW THEY LOOK, THEY KNOW WHO THIS MAN WAS. I WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH HIM. I WAS PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE DID TOGETHER, A RECOVERY ACT THAT KEPT US FROM GOING INTO A DEPRESSION FROM MY POINT OF VIEW. HEALTHCARE. I'M MOST PROUD OF THE MAN THAT HE WAS AND IS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ APPLAUSE ] HE WAS THINKING , HE WAS SPEAKING, I WAS IN CALIFORNIA SPEAKING AT THE SAME TIME. WE WERE IN DIFFERENT PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE WERE BOTH ASKED COINCIDENTALLY, WHAT WE WERE MOST PROUD OF IN THE ADMINISTRATION. IT TURNS OUT WE SAID THE SAME THING BUT A DIFFERENT WAY. YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS MOST PROUD OF? EIGHT YEARS, THERE WASN'T ONE SINGLE HINT OF A SCANDAL. NOT ONE. AND IF YOU DID INSTINCTIVELY MISSED HIM HE REMINDED WHY WE NEED HIM BACK. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP, A THREAT TO UNITED STATES. ATTACKING PRIVATE CITIZENS USING LANGUAGE LIKE TOTAL LOSER. BARACK OBAMA WOULD NOT DO THAT. NO PRESIDENT WOULD DO THAT. MOST TEENAGERS WOULDN'T DO THAT. HE SETTING A STANDARD. THE STANDARD OF CRUDE LANGUAGE AND EMBARRASSING BEHAVIOR THAT IS BURROWING INTO OUR CULTURE, FOR REAL. IT'S IN OUR CULTURE. IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET RID OF IT BUT WE MUST. WE MUST. IT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. AND FOLKS, FRANKLY, OUR DEMOCRACY, OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT RISK. I DID NOT THINK I WOULD USE THOSE WORDS IN MY LIFETIME BUT IT IS TRUE. EVERYWHERE YOU TURN, TRUMP IS TEARING DOWN THE GUARD RAILS OF DEMOCRACY. TEARING DOWN THE THINGS THAT PREVENT THE ABUSE OF POWER WHETHER IT IS A MAN RAISING HIS HAND TO STRIKE A WOMAN OR CHILD OR EMPLOYER THREATENING WORKERS OR TREATING THEM LIKE DIRT OR AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT WHO HAS NO RESPECT FOR A RULE OF LAW. FAKE NEWS. ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. THESE AREN'T WORDS TO BE LAUGHED AT OR DISMISSED. LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD. THINK OF THE DICTATORS USING THE SAME LANGUAGE THAT TRUMP USES TO JUSTIFY THEIR ABUSES OF POWER IN THEIR COUNTRIES. IT'S NOT A JOKE. THINK ABOUT IT. TRUMP'S GOAL IS SIMPLE. DISCREDIT THE NEWS, DISCREDIT THE FREE PRESS, AND RUN OVER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN TERMS OF THEIR SAFEGUARDS AND ROUGH SHOTS HIS TACK IS ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE COURTS. WHEN HE SAID A JUDGE WOULD NOT GIVE HIM A FAIR HEARING WHEN HE DISAGREED WITH THEM. HE'S LOOKING BAD BECAUSE WHERE HE'S LOOKING TO TEAR DOWN THE CONSTRAINTS THE COURTS OF PUT ON HIM. FROM THE FAI TO THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THINK ABOUT IT. I PRESIDED OVER BOTH OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND IS DOING MAJOR INTELLIGENCE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE ABSOLUTELY ABUSES THEM. THEY MAKE MISTAKE, BUT HE MAKES MISTAKES BUT MY LORD, TREATING LIKE THEY ARE THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE DEEP STATE. THE DEEP STATE. IT'S LIKE OUT OF A SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL. AS WELL AS BY THE WAY ATTACKING CONGRESS WHETHER IT'S DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN. HE DOESN'T CARE. IT'S ABOUT BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT CONSTRAIN HIS POWER. HE'S COMPLETELY IGNORING THE LEGITIMACY OF CONGRESS. AND HE'S DOING IT WITH FULL COMPLICITY OF THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS THAT HE KNEW BETTER. THEY KNOW BETTER. THEY KNOW IT'S WRONG. LOOK, IN 2020, WE NOT ONLY HAVE TO REPAIR HIS POLICIES AND VALUES, WE HAVE TO CLEARLY AND FULLY PROJECT OUR OWN SAFETY SAKE, HIS VIEW OF THE PRESIDENCY. , \"I HAVE COMPLETE POWER,\" NO YOU DON'T, DONALD TRUMP. , \"I HAVE ABSOLUTE POWER PEER\" NO YOU DON'T, DONALD TRUMP HERE COULD OR, \"ONLY I CAN FIX IT PURE\" FIX YOURSELF FIRST, DONALD TRUMP. ONE HAS THE PRESIDENT EVER USED THOSE PHRASES? IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAR NO PRESIDENT HAS USED THOSE PHRASES. IN A MOMENT WHERE WE NEED TO RESET THE CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS IN THE COUNTRY. THE PRESIDENCY IS NOT WITHOUT LIMITS. THE WAY OUR SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO WORK, BUILT BY OUR FOUNDERS IT'S ALLOWING US TO HAVE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRACY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND WE ARE GOING TO RUE THE DAY IF WE DECIDE TO WALK AWAY FROM THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE DEMOCRACY. I'M OPTIMISTIC. IF I GET ELECTED, WHEN I WAS 29 YEARS OLD I WAS ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE I WAS NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. I DON'T COME FROM ANY MATERIAL BACKGROUND. RICHARD NIXON WAS RUNNING IN DELAWARE, DELAWARE GOT 64% OF THE VOTE I WON BY A LANDSLIDE OF 3100 VOTES. MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE FIREFIGHTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT FOLKS, I WAS THE YOUNG OPTIMIST AND IDEALIST. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S POSSIBILITIES TODAY THAN I WAS THEN. BUT NONE OF IT CAN HAVE BEEN IF HE'S STILL THERE. THINK ABOUT THIS, IF WE COULD THINK ABOUT A DIFFERENT PRESIDENCY. NOT EVEN ME JUST DIFFERENT PRESIDENT. WHO BETTER TO LEAD THE WORLD IN THE 21st CENTURY. THE U.S. HAD THE BEST RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN ALL THE WORLD THE MOST INNOVATIVE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS WORKERS IN ASIA. NO OTHER NATION COULD MATCH US.. THIS IDEA IS SO BIG. IT'S MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY DICTATOR OR TYRANT. WERE BIGGER THAN ANYTHING ONLY WE CAN UNDO OURSELVES. SO LOOK, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. THEY HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT WHO HE IS OR HIS CHARACTER. THEY MAY CHOOSE HIM BECAUSE HE'S BENEFITING THEM IN WAYS THAT IN FACT ARE, CONTRARY TO THE BASIC NORMS. BUT HERE'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, WE HAVE TO LEARN WHO WE DEMOCRATS ARE. WHAT WE STAND FOR. TRUTH OVERLIES, AND FACTOR FICTION. WE HAVE TO PICK OUR HEADS OUT, REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY TO DO. TOGETHER, GOD BLESS YOU ALL. AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU-THANK YOU-THANK YOU. BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE YOU CAME AROUND, BEEN A LONG TIME BUT I'M BACK IN TIME, THIS TIME I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT YOU. THIS TIME I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT YOU.

MY TIME'S RUNNING. HEY, THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. I NEVER LIKE TO CUT OFF CHEERS BUT MY TIME IS RUNNING HERE. WELCOME, SOUTH CAROLINA, TO , WE'RE HAPPY ALL TO BE HERE. THIS ELECTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYONE YOU HAVE EVER BEEN ENGAGED IN. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO HAS PROMOTED HATE AND DIVISION AND ENCOURAGED WHITE SUPREMACY AND EMBRACES DICTATORSHIPS AROUND THE WORLD,. LOOK, OUR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING, THEY ARE WATCHING. IT MATTERS WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAY AND DO. BARACK OBAMA THEY WATCHED AND THE EMULATED, THEY WANTED TO BE LIKE HIM. FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP ULTIMATELY CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP IS THE OVERWHELMING IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE TO FOLKS, WE CAN BEGIN TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS NATION. HARD-WORKING PEOPLE, MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD AMERICA. YOU BUILT. AMERICA. ERRORS PEOPLE GIVEN A CHANCE IN AMERICA , AVERAGE PEOPLE GIVEN A CHANCE IN AMERICA. NOW THE BOTTOM IS FALLING OUT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. INCOME INEQUITY IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. TRUMP TAX CUTS AND ENORMOUS GIVEAWAYS TO THE TOP 1\/10 OF 1%. IT'S TIME WE START TO REWARD WORK OVER WEALTH. WE NEED TO BIG , BOLD. THE TAX LOOPHOLES BUILT IN THAT HAVE NO SOCIAL REDEEMING VALUE. AND PUT THAT MONEY TO GOOD USE. HEALTH CARE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE NEED TO SAVE AND BUILD UPON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, NOT SAID IT, JETTISON IT. 20 MILLION PEOPLE ARE COVERED THAT WERE NOT BEFORE. 140 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. I AM , I WAS PROUD EVERY DAY TO SERVE WITH BARACK OBAMA BUT LET ME TELL YOU, NEVER PROUDER THAN HE GOT DONE WHAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO DO. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO CREATE THE JOBS. UNDER MY PLAN, WHETHER YOU'RE COVERED BY EMPLOYER ON YOUR OWN OR NOT AT ALL YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FLY INTO A PUBLIC HEALTH CARE OPTION LIKE MEDICARE. AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE IT AND IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE ENROLLED IN THAT. WE CAN GUARANTEE THAT THE POOR , ARE IN FACT COVERED BECAUSE THEY CAN BE, AND IT IS WITHIN OUR INTEREST IN IT WILL SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, EDUCATION. 12 YEARS ARE NO LONGER ENOUGH FOR THE 12 FOR CENTURY OF EDUCATION. FOLKS, THAT IS WHY WANTED TRIPLE TITLE I FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. AND, BY THE WAY, WE CAN AFFORD TO DO THIS. $15 TO $45 BILLION, WE NEED UNIVERSAL PRE-K WE NEED TO RAISE TEACHERS PAY AND WE NEED TO FULLY FUND SPECIAL EDUCATION\" NUMBER OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST, GUIDANCE COUNSELORS AND NURSES BECAUSE TEACHERS CANNOT DO IT ALL ON THEIR OWN. AND, OLKFOLKS, WE CAN EASILY AFFORD FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CUTTING IN HALF THE COST OF FOUR YEAR COLLEGES FOR EVERYONE QUALIFIED TO GET IN AND, WE HAVE TO REDUCE THE STUDENT DEBT WHICH I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO GO INTO NOW BUT WE WILL. CHAPTER. I, CHILDCARE. I KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE A SINGLE PARENT. I WAS ONE FOR FIVE YEARS. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE FOR PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE HELP THAT I HAD. I THINK WE SHOULD PROVIDE AN $8,000 TAX CREDIT FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAS A CHILD THAT NEEDS CHILDCARE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, CLIMATE CHANGE. WE HAVE TO RESTORE WHAT BARACK OBAMA AND I DID IN TERMS OF FUEL ECONOMY AND DOUBLING THE FUEL ECONOMY AS WELL AS COAL FIRED PLANTS. WE CAN DOUBLE OUR SHORES , WIND ENERGY BY 2030 PROVIDING $400 BILLION IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS FOR CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION. MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH AS WE SPENT GOING TO THE MOON. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ALSO HAVE TO HOLD A LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE. YOU SAW THE HEADLINES TODAY'S PAPER. IT SAID, SOUTH CAROLINA $2 BILLION PIPES LIKE TISSUE PAPER THREATENING PUBLIC HEALTH. IT IS ON EXCEPT , UNACCEPTABLE THAT THAT OCCURRED. IT IS NOT JUST IN SOUTH CAROLINA. IT IS AROUND AMERICA. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THERE IT TOO MEET PEOPLE IN PRISON AND TOO MANY BLACK MEN AND BLACK WOMEN IN PRISON. IN OUR ADMINISTRATION WE STARTED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND REFORM PRISONS BY 38,000 PEOPLE CAME OUT. WE PASSED THE SUPPORT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND INITIATIVES TO BREAK THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE BUT WE NEED TO PASS BOBBY SCOTT FROM VIRGINIA'S SAFE JUSTICE ACT. I GOT TO ADD A FEW THINGS. NO MORE MANDATORY MINIMUMS. PERIOD. AND PRIVATE PRISONS WHICH WE DID IN OUR BILL. PERIOD. FUND MY DRUG COURTS, TO ABOUT $1 BILLION THE YEAR. NO ONE SHOULD BE GOING TO JAIL BECAUSE THEY ARE ADDICTED. THEY SHOULD BE GOING INTO REHABILITATION, NOT TO JAIL. BAIL REFORM. IS BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY SHOULD NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD LANGUISH IN JAIL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NO TUNABLES , NO JUVENILE AS AN ADULT PRISON AND MANDATORY TREATMENT IN JAIL FOR PEOPLE WHO ALSO SUFFER FROM ADDICTION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA AND AUTOMATICALLY EXPUNGE RECORDS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED. AND, BY THE WAY, INSTEAD OF KICKING PEOPLE , WE SHOULD BE EDUCATING PEOPLE IN PRISON. IT IS IN OUR INTEREST TO DO SO. AUTOMATIC RESTORATION OF RIGHTS, MEANING NOT ONLY YOU CAN VOTE BUT YOU QUALIFY FOR EVERY PROGRAM INCLUDING PELL GRANTS TO GET YOUR EDUCATION. IT MAKES NO SENSE. LOOK, FOLKS, WE HAVE TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HARNESS THIS. WE ARE IN A COUPLE OF MAJOR CHANGES AND CANCER, DIABETES AND ALZHEIMER'S. WE CAN DO THIS BY DOUBLING NIH'S BUDGET AND SET UP A NEW PROJECT THAT , LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TO COME UP WITH THE WHOLE INTERNET, PROVIDE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR BASIC RESEARCH. HEALTHCARE, FOCUS ON RESEARCH AND TAKE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON SOLVING PROBLEMS THAT IS WITHIN OUR REACH LIKE THAT CANCER INITIATIVE AND THE MOONSHOT. LOOK, I GBBEAT THE NRA BEFORE. WE OUGHT TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS AND MAGAZINES, AND, BY THE WAY, NEW TECHNOLOGY, YOU CANNOT ACQUIRE A GUN UNLESS YO UHAVE BIOMETRIC PRINT ON IT. NO PROBLEM IN TERMS OF SECOND AMENDMENT AND YOU HAVE TO PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK WHICH I PUT INTO LAW AS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BRADY AMENDMENT. EVERYBODY, FOLKS, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CAN FUNDAMENTALLY RESHAPE OUR LIVES. I'M NEVER MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO PICK OUR HEADS UP. I REMEMBER THE PHRASE FROM JOHN KENNEDY GOING TO THE MOON, BECAUSE WE ARE UNWILLING TO POSTPONE. I'M NOT WILLING TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER THE POTENTIAL OF THIS NATION. IT IS TOTALLY IN OUR POWER TO CHANGE IT. GOD BLESS YOU, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, APPRECIATE IT.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?461983-20\/south-carolina-democratic-party-convention-joe-biden","Summary":"Former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, spoke at the South Carolina Democratic Party convention in Columbia.","Source":"461983-20","Type":"Speech"}

IT IS MY HONOR TO BE HERE AS I HELPED TO MC AND HOST THE LABOR , EMCEE AND HOST THE LABOR CONFERENCE FOR RAINBOW PUSH. I DO THE EVENING NEWS, 5:00 NEWS, 10:00 NEWS,, ANYTHING ELSE? THIS GENERAL MANAGER WANTS ME TO DO IT, SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME HERE TODAY. IT IS DEFINITELY MY HONOR ON THIS FIRST DAY OF THE FIVE-DAY CONVENTION. WE ARE KICKING IT OFF IN GRAND STYLE, DON'T YOU THINK? WE HAVE FABULOUS GUESTS. IT WILL BE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT. WE APPLAUD THE WORK RAINBOW PUSH HAS BEEN DOING THESE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. THE CONSTANT FIGHT FOR EQUALITY AND HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS IS NOW HOPING TO EASE THE PAIN AT THE BORDER, HOLDING CENTERS AMONG MANY OF HIS OTHER CONSTANT BATTLES. WE WRECK , WE COMMEND HIM FOR THAT. WE ARE IN INTERESTING TIMES RIGHT NOW BUT WE APPLAUD AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE RAINBOW PUSH, ALWAYS FOCUSING ON THOSE IN NEED. RIGHT NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME TO THE STAGE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHICAGO FEDERATION OF LABOR. HE HAS DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO LABOR UNIONS THROUGH HIS WORK AS A LABOR ATTORNEY, ORGANIZER, NEGOTIATOR, AND LOBBYIST. MR. ROBERT RYDER. [APPLAUSE] WHILE THAT IS SO COOL BEING INTRODUCED BY HER. I AM PRESIDENT OF THE CHICAGO FEDERATION OF LABOR. WE REPRESENT 300 UNIONS THAT REPRESENT WORKING WHEN AND MEN IN CHICAGO AND TOOK COUNTY. I AM EXCITED TO BE HERE. WE ARE DOING IT RIGHT HERE IN THE HALL AND THAT IS AWESOME. [APPLAUSE] I WOULD REMOVE , BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THIS THIS HOUSE THAT CAROLYN BUILT. LAST TIME I WAS AT THIS MICROPHONE, THERE WERE CAMERAS HERE AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A CHARTER SCHOOL STRIKE THAT I PROMISE NOT TO USE TODAY, REVEREND JACKSON. I WANT TO GET UP HERE AND TALK ABOUT THE LABOR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY. OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE HAD STRONG CONNECTIONS BETWEEN LABOR AND COMMUNITY. THE LABOR UNIONS WERE SOME OF THE FIRST COMMUNITY GROUPS THAT ORGANIZED WHEN EACH INDIVIDUAL BLOCK IN THE CITY WAS A GATHERING PLACE AND THEY CAME FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD AND THEY HAD HOUSES OF WORSHIP AND THE GROCERY STORE AND THE EMPLOYER SOMETIMES WITHIN THAT ONE SQUARE BLOCK AREA. IT IS IMPORTANT TO US TO RENEW THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTANT. WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE. LABOR CAN'T DO IT ALONE AND COMMUNITY CAN'T DO IT ALONE. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT CONNECTION WE HAVE HAD IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO OVER THE COURSE OF SO MANY YEARS IS THAT WITH REVEREND JESSE LEWIS JACKSON. MARVIN JACKSON HAS BEEN A PART OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT SINCE HE STOOD WITH DR. KING IN MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE AND SUPPORTED SANITATION WORKERS ON STRIKE. WHEN DR. KING WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED, NOT JUST FOR ONE UNION BUT FOR ALL UNIONS, HE STOOD WITH THE SANITATION WORKERS. REVEREND JACKSON STOOD WITH HOSPITAL WORKERS ORGANIZING HERE IN CHICAGO IN THE 1970'S AND FIREFIGHTERS FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE AND EQUITY IN RELATION TO THEIR EMPLOYMENT WITH THE CITY OF CHICAGO. RAVEN JACKSON HAS STOOD WITH LABOR, BOTH WORKING WITH US LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY. LABOR MOVEMENT IN CHICAGO IS STRONG. WE ARE VIBRANT. AND WE FIGHT LIKE HELL. WE HAVE A STORY OF JOB ACTIONS BUT WE HAVE ESCALATED THINGS IN THE WAKE OF THE CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION STRIKE IN 2012. IN MY TIME AT THE CHICAGO FEDERATION OF LABOR, WE HAVE SEEN AUTO MECHANICS GO ON STRIKE FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS. WE HAVE SEEN CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ON STRIKE FOR WEEKS AT A TIME. WE SAW HOTEL WORKERS TAKE TO THE STREETS FOR ONE OF THE MOST HISTORIC STRIKES IN THE HISTORY OF THE CITY AS WELL. REVEREND JACKSON HAS STOOD WITH US THROUGH ALL OF THAT. I CAN'T THINK OF ONE PERSON IN THIS COMMUNITY WHO HAS DONE MORE TO WORK WITH US IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT TO LIFT UP PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PEOPLE WHO WORK IN A-WAGE JOBS THAN REVEREND JACKSON. [APPLAUSE] AND LET ME SUGGEST TO YOU THIS , IF ANYONE OF YOU WANT TO QUESTION WHETHER REVEREND JACKSON HAS SOME GAS IN THE TANK LEFT, LET'S GO FIND A BUILDING TO STAND OUTSIDE OF. HE WILL CLIMB UP ON THAT BENCH AND PUT HIS FISTS IN THE AIR AND FIGHT FOR THE WORKING PEOPLE OF THIS CITY AND COUNTRY. I WANT TO THANK YOU, REVEREND NOXON, AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR HAVING HERE TODAY. , REVEREND JACKSON, AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING HERE TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY GOOD FRIEND, DEBORAH LANE ARIAN [APPLAUSE] GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. I AM FROM A AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION 3:08, FIRST ORGANIZER OF OUR UNION AND FINANCIAL SECRETARY. I AM SO GLAD AND HONORED THAT WE ARE HERE TODAY TO CELEBRATE THIS GATHERING WITH LABOR UNIONS. WE WILL CHICAGO. THAT IS WHAT WE DO. WE ARE OVER THE OPERATORS IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO AND WE GOT OUR MOVEMENT MENTORING RIGHT HERE IN THIS HOUSE THAT KAREN LEWIS BUILT. REVEREND JACKSON, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU HELPED TO GET WHAT WAS RIGHT TO US. WE ARE NEW TO THE LABOR UNION GAME BUT WE ARE HERE AND WE ARE GOING TO STAND PROUD AND FIGHT FOR WHAT IS EQUALLY HOURS. AS LOCAL 308, WE ARE TO STAND AND WE THANK YOU FOR WELCOMING US IN. [APPLAUSE] SO I AM BACK. WE HAVE A LOT OF HISTORIC TIMES HERE IN THE CITY. WE RECENTLY ELECTED A NEW GOVERNOR AFTER HAVING FOUR YEARS OF A GOVERNOR WHO WAS TRYING TO DESTROY THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. BILLS ARE BEING SIGNED REGARDING CAPITAL AND OTHER INITIATIVES TO HELP LIFT THE STATE OF ILLINOIS UP. WE HAD AN ELECTION IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. AFTER WHAT WE SEE AS A TIME WHERE WE HAVE LOOKED AT DECADES OF THIS INVESTMENT FROM NEIGHBORHOODS HERE IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO, FROM DECADES OF PEOPLE OF MANUFACTURING AND OTHER RESOURCES BEING ROBBED FROM OUR COMMUNITIES IN ORDER FOR FOLKS TO EARN A DECENT WAGE. WE HAVE FACED THIS ELECTION WHERE WE HAD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE RUNNING TO BECOME THE NEXT MAYOR OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO. I ONLY TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG CHALLENGE. ONE SIDE OF THE CITY IS BRIGHT AND SHINY, AND THERE IS A WHOLE OTHER PART THAT CRIES FOR HELP. , HOPE. WE FACED A RUNOFF ELECTION BETWEEN TWO WOMEN WHO I BELIEVE HAD THE HEART OF THE CITY IN THEIR HEART. EITHER WAY THAT ELECTION COMES OUT WAS GOING TO BE HISTORIC BECAUSE THE CITY ELECTED ITS FIRST BLACK FEMALE MAYOR. [APPLAUSE] THAT WAS AMAZING AND THAT IS WITH THE CITY NEEDED. LET ME TALK MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT OUR NEW AIR. LORI LIGHTFOOT , NEW MAYOR. LORI LIGHTFOOT WAS ELECTED AS MAYOR. I SERVED ON HER TRANSMISSION COMMITTEE. NOT BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE FROM BLABER SIT AT THE TABLE, BUT BECAUSE , SOMEONE FROM LABOR SIT AT THE TABLE, BUT BECAUSE THEY WANTED OUR THOUGHTS AT THE FOREFRONT. I WORKED WITH MAYOR LIGHTFOOT THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES. IT IS NOT OUR DISAGREEMENTS OR OUR AGREEMENTS THAT WILL IDENTIFY, BUT HOW WE WILL WORK TOGETHER TO RESOLVE ISSUES. FROM THE FIRST TIME I SAT DOWN WITH LORI LIGHTFOOT A YEAR AGO, I LOOKED IN THIS WOMAN'S EYES AND KNEW SHE WAS A FIGHTER AND KNEW THAT SHE WOULD FIGHT NOT ONLY TO BECOME THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO BUT TO FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WHO PUT THEIR SHOES ON EVERYDAY AND GO TO WORK. WE HAVE BIG CHALLENGES IN THE CITY. IF WE ARE GOING TO MEET THEM, WE ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER, LABOR, COMMUNITY, AND GOVERNMENT. I COULDN'T THINK OF A BETTER PARTNER TO HAVE IN THAT VENTURE RIGHT NOW THAN LORI LIGHTFOOT. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE NEW MAYOR OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO, LORI LIGHTFOOT. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON THIS PODIUM. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR THE GENEROUS INTRODUCTION. I AM HONORED TO BE IN YOUR PRESENCE. I AM HONORED TO BE HERE IN THE HOUSE THAT KAREN LEWIS BUILT AND THE PART THAT JESSE AND CTU ARE CARRYING ON A TRADITION OF FIGHTING FOR WHAT IS RIGHT AND BEING ON THE SIDE OF WORKING PEOPLE IN THE CITY. I AM A PRODUCT , [APPLAUSE] MAYOR LIGHTFOOT: I AM A PRODUCT OF A WORKING FAMILY. I CANNOT BE HERE WITHOUT WORKING ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES MY FATHER WORKED IN THE FACTORY AND TWO AND THREE JOBS. I AM HERE BECAUSE OF THE SACRIFICES HE AND MY MOTHER MADE EVERY DAY TO PROVIDE A BETTER LIFE FOR ME AND MY SIBLINGS TO PROVIDE US WITH OPPORTUNITY. I AM HERE TO BRING YOU GREETINGS FROM THE GREAT CITY OF CHICAGO, THE CITY THAT ORGANIZED LABOR BUILT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [APPLAUSE] MAYOR LIGHTFOOT: AS THIS YEAR'S THEME FOR THE CONVENTION OUTLINES, IT HAS BEEN 400 YEARS SINCE THE FIRST AFRICAN REACHED OUR NATIONS SHORES IN CHAINS. IT IS A LEGACY OLDER THAN THE NATION ITSELF. THE ARK OF WHICH HAS BEEN MORE SLAVES AND FREE WHERE THE FULL RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP HAS BEEN ENJOYED ONLY FOR THE LAST 50 OF THOSE YEARS, AND REFRACTION OF THAT TIME. THE 400 YEARS HAVE COME TO DEFINE THE FIBER OF OUR NATION, TOUCHING EVERY ASPECT OF OUR ECONOMY, OUR CULTURE, AND OUR SOCIETY. WHAT DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. CHICAGO SELF EMBODIES THAT LEGACY IN ALL OF ITS FORMS, GOOD AND BAD. IN OUR CAPACITY TO OVERCOME AND HOW WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE, FUNDAMENTAL INEQUITY AND INJUSTICE. THE QUESTION FOR US RESTS IN WHAT THIS WEEKEND'S THEME EXPLORES , HOW DO WE REPAIR THE DAMAGE DONE? IT IS THE SAME QUESTION POSED WHEN WE EXPLORE CHICAGO'S OWN CHALLENGES OF INCOME AND HOUSING SEGREGATION, THE CONCENTRATED VIOLENCE, PRECARIOUS FINANCES FOR WORKING FAMILIES, LACK OF GOOD PAYING JOBS INTO MANY NEIGHBORHOODS, THE DISINVESTMENT WE SEE IN NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE AUSTIN, COMPARED TO THE SEEMINGLY LIMITLESS FLOW OF CAPITAL IN NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE LAKEVIEW AND THE GOLD COAST. A RECENT STUDY BY THE URBAN INSTITUTE FOUND THAT OVER THE PAST DECADE, PRIVATE RESOURCES INVESTED AN AVERAGE OF $22,476 PER HOUSEHOLD EVERY YEAR AND THE MAJORITY WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS. MEANWHILE, IN MAJORITY BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS, IT SHRUNK TO UNDER $5,000. THAT IS OVER 15,000 DIFFERENTIAL. THESE QUESTIONS OF HOW WE REPAIR THE DIFFERENT MAY TAKE SOME DIFFERENT FORMS BUT WERE DRAWN FROM THE SAME SOURCES. AS DR. KING SAID, \"THE TENSIONS ARE NOT BETWEEN RACE BETWEEN THE FORCES OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE BETWEEN THE FORCES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS.\" IT IS IN URBAN CENTERS ALL CROSS OUR NATION. THE ONLY QUESTION IS TRULY ADDRESSED IN ONE WAY, AND THAT IS HAD ON. I AM MINDFUL OF VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN IN OUR PRESENCE AND I WOULD SAY TO YOU AND ANYONE WHO ASPIRES TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , WE MUST HAVE A FULL-SCALE, URBAN RENEWAL PROGRAM THAT DEALS WITH THE ISSUES OF POVERTY AND INJUSTICE IN OUR NATION. [APPLAUSE] MAYOR LIGHTFOOT: THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET THERE IS THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE INVESTMENT, COMPREHENSIVE, COORDINATED ECONOMIC LANDING, AND TRUE ACCESS TO THE BASIC COMMUNITY BUILDING BLOCKS. AS THE CENTURY OLD HYMN GOES, PAST ME NOT A GENTLE SAVIOR, HEAR MY HUMBLE CRY, WHILE ANOTHER IS CALLING, DO NOT PASS ME BY. [APPLAUSE] MAYOR LIGHTFOOT: THIS IS A HIM THAT I HEARD ON , HYMN THAT I HEARD IN COUNTLESS CHURCHES GROWING UP AND WHY HEARD IS WE CANNOT LOOK AWAY FROM THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. IN CHICAGO, IF WE WANT TO BE A TRULY GLOBAL CITY, WE NEED TO LOOK SOUTH OF ROOSEVELT ROAD AND WEST OF ASHLAND. [APPLAUSE] MAYOR LIGHTFOOT: THIS IS OUR CHALLENGE BUT OUR OPPORTUNITY. IT IS A SHARED MISSION AND SHARED MANDATE THAT WE HAVE TO CHARGE DIRECTLY INTO. THE EXCUSES, WHATEVER THEY MAY BE, WE HAVE TO PUT THEM ASIDE AND FACE A MOMENT OF RECKONING, AND THAT TIME IS NOW. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AND ENCOURAGING THE VIGOROUS DEBATE AND DISCUSSION WE MUST HAVE BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT THE HEART AND SOUL OF WHO WE ARE GOING TO BE, NOT JUST AS A CITY OR A STATE, BUT AS A NATION. IT IS TIME. WE MUST FORGE AHEAD AND GRAPPLE IN THIS MOMENT AND WE HAVE TO DO IT TOGETHER, NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] NOW TO THE MAN WHO STARTED IT ALL. HE FOUGHT INJUSTICE IN THE SOUTH LONG BEFORE HE MET DR. KING. IT WAS HIS WORK AND STRUGGLES THAT CAUGHT DR. KING'S EYES. HE CAME TO CHICAGO, STARTED OPERATION BREADBASKET AND THEN OPERATION PUSH, AND NO RAINBOW PUSH. 55 YEARS OF WORKING TOWARDS INEQUALITY. [APPLAUSE] WORKING FOR JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS, NOT JUST CIVIL. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE MAN WHO IS HERE. HE WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO ANOTHER SPECIAL PERSON YOU WILL TALK TO TONIGHT, BUT HE STARTED IT ALL AND IS WHY WE ARE HERE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, REVEREND JESSE LEWIS JACKSON. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: I AM ANXIOUS TO BRING ON THE VICE PRESIDENT FROM DELAWARE. I WANT TO MAKE ONE SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN HE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN WAS TO HAVE A PANEL OF WORKERS. THE LAST DRIVE WAS FOR THE CAMPAIGN. HE ORGANIZED A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT. WHEN IT WAS ORGANIZED, THEY WAGED BENEFITS. I WANT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION WHO IS HERE AS A SPECIAL GUEST , WHERE IS HE? A BIG HAND. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER LIKE YOU REALLY MEAN IT. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: FOUR , OVER 50 YEARS AGO, A MAN SAID SOMETHING IS GOING ON IN MEMPHIS. I THINK SOMETHING IS GOING ON HERE IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. I AM JUST HUMBLED, REVEREND JACKSON, THAT I HAVE BEEN INVITED HERE. THE CHICAGO LABOR FEDERATION, MY DISTRICT COUNCIL 14. MY BUSINESS MANAGER AND EVERYONE IN ATTENDANCE. IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO BE HERE AND TALK ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL UNION AND TRADE. IT KNOWS ONE THING FOR SURE , THAT THING FOR SURE IS THAT WE KNOW AS A BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADE UNION THAT WE CANNOT DO IT BY OURSELVES. I STAND BEFORE YOU AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF ALLIED TRADES AND AS A PERSON WHO LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF IN THIS ROOM. I CAN TELL YOU, I AM THE FIRST PERSON THAT THE GENERAL PRESIDENT OF A BUILDING TRADES UNION THAT LOOKS LIKE SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THIS VERY ROOM. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: I SAY THAT NOT AS I SAY THAT NOT AS AN EGO. I PRETTY MUCH A HUMBLE PERSON AND DO NOT THINK OF MYSELF AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A WHOLE LOT TO SAY, OTHER THAN WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TO MY UNION. BUT I REALIZED BECAUSE I AM THE SON OF A BUILDING TRADESMEN. I AM THE SON OF A MAN WHO CAME FROM THE CIVIC THEATER AFTER WORLD WAR II AND WANTED TO BECOME A CARPENTER. THAT WAS IN THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA , THAT GREAT, PROGRESSIVE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HE WENT TO A UNION HALL AND THEY SAID YOU HAVE TO GET A JOB BEFORE YOU JOINED THE UNION. HE WENT TO SOME CONTRACTORS AND THEY SAID HAVE TO JOIN A JOB. I THINK YOU ALL HEAR ME. [LAUGHTER] AFTER DOING THAT AND GOING AROUND THE MERRY-GO-ROUND, HE MET A CONTRACTOR WHO SAID I WILL HIRE YOU. HE WENT TO THE UNION HALL IN CALIFORNIA IN 1947. WE DON'T ALLOW COLORED FOLKS IN THIS UNION. HE WENT BACK TO THE CONTRACTOR AND THE CONTRACTOR SAID YOU GO TO THE BUILDING IN VALDES STREET AND YOU TELL THE BUSINESS MANAGER THAT IF HE DOESN'T BRING YOU INTO THE UNION, HE WILL HAVE AN INJUNCTION ON HIS BLEEP. HE SAID I AM NOW GOING TO GO TO THE UNION MEETING. HE WENT TO THE UNION MEETING. HE SAT ON THE ROW. NOBODY SAT IN THE ROPE BEHIND HIM OR IN FRONT OF HIM, AND THEY STARTED WITH THE JOKES. BUT ONE THING I LEARNED FROM MY FATHER , PERSEVERANCE. THAT WORD PERSEVERANCE. HE HUNG IN THERE. HE BECAME A MEMBER OF HIS UNION AND BECAME A JOURNEYMAN AND BECAME THE PRESIDENT OF HIS LOCAL UNION. HE PROCEEDED TO WORK HIS WAY TO BECOME A BUSINESSMAN TO WORK AND BECOME A SUPERINTENDENT, TO WORK AND MOVE HIS FAMILY FORWARD ALONG WITH HIS COMMUNITY. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT FUELED ME. BUT TO BE ABLE TO HEAR FOLKS TELL THEIR STORY , THE STORY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WHEN SOMEONE TELLS THEIR STORY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE AND HOW THEY PERSEVERED TO GET TO WHERE THEY ARE, IT IS NOT TO CRITIQUE ANYBODY, BUT IT IS TO LET YOU KNOW THAT FOLKS WEAR AND FACE CHALLENGES. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT. MY UNION NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT. THE BUILDING TRADES NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT. ORGANIZED LABOR NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS IN THESE DAYS, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS A TRUE AND HONEST CONVERSATION. IF YOU DON'T, YOU ARE SELLING YOURSELF SHORT. AS A LEADER OF THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF ALLIED TRADES, WE WANT VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT ARE INCLUSIVE. WE HAVE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN WORKER COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A WOMAN'S COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A LATINO COMMITTEE. SOME OF MY FELLOW MEMBERS SAY , WHY IS NOT FAIR FOR A WHITE COMMITTEE? OUR UNION HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 130 YEARS, I THINK THE FIRST 125 , IT WAS , A WHITE COMMITTEE. I AM JUST TRYING TO MAKE THE POINT. I AM NOT SAYING TO CRITIQUE YOU. THE CLOCK IS WINDING OFF AND I HAVE TO GET OFF OF THE STAGE REAL QUICK. I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS A UNION THAT WORKS FOR CONSTITUENCIES AND FOR COMMUNITIES AND WE WORK FOR OUR MEMBERSHIP. OUR JOB IS TO BE AN ASSET TO ORGANIZED LABOR AND TO BE AN ASSET IN CHICAGO, AND TO BE AN ASSET IN THE UNITED STATES, CALIFORNIA, IN ORDER TO ADVANCE. THAT IS WHAT WE DO. THAT IS OUR COMMITMENT AND I WON'T STAND FOR ANYTHING LESS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN. [LAUGHTER] REV. JACKSON: FIRST, I WANT THE VICE PRESIDENT'S GRANDDAUGHTER , COME ON UP HERE, GRANDDAUGHTER. MAYOR LIGHTFOOT, MAYOR, JUDGE GREG MATHIS. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: WE LOVE THAT MAN. [APPLAUSE] REV. JACKSON: ACROSS THESE YEARS, WE HAVE WORKED HAND IN HAND ON CRITICAL PROJECTS WITH JOE BIDEN, OVER THE TRENCHERS, TRYING TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER, AGREE TO AGREE, AGREE TO DISAGREE IN A CIVIL WAY. SOME OF MY BEST MENTORING MINISTERS IN THE WORLD, FROM DELAWARE, MEETING JOE BACK IN THE EARLY 1970'S, THE DAUGHTER OF MY CLASSMATE IS NOW THE CONGRESSWOMAN FROM DELAWARE. WE USUALLY WORK TOGETHER. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS IN A PARTICULAR WAY. WHEN THE GREAT BARACK OBAMA BECAME OUR PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, DOUBTS, FEARS, EVERYWHERE. TWO SETS OF RULES. HE WAS THE SOUTH AFRICAN AMERICAN WHO COVER THE WATERFRONT, IN DEPTH AND BREADTH, TRUSTWORTHY, WITH HIS RUNNING MATE, TWICE TAKING OUR NATION TO THE HIGHEST HEIGHTS. BARACK OBAMA CHOSE A RUNNING MATE, JOE BIDEN. JOE, IN THE CHALLENGE LABOR MEETING, OUR FOCUS IS TEMPORARY WORK IS A WORKING SCAM. THE WORKERS' RIGHT TO VOTE IS UNDER ATTACK. BY THE WRITTEN LAWS IN THE SOUTH OF OUR COUNTRY. THEY CANNOT AFFORD GOOD HEALTH CARE. YOU HAVE THE STUFF THAT IT TAKES TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER, SO JOE BIDEN, PLEASE STAND AND COME FORWARD. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, REVEREND. WELL, I AM HERE TO INTRODUCE, ANOTHER BIDEN WHO IS GOING TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MY GRANDDAUGHTER, FINNEGAN BIDEN. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, I LOST A DAUGHTER, I HAVE ONE DAUGHTER THAT SURVIVED, AND I HAVE FOUR GRANDDAUGHTERS, AND LET ME TELL YOU, THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE A GRANDDAUGHTER? HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE HAD A DAUGHTER AS WELL? HERE IS THE DEAL , DAUGHTERS ALWAYS ARE WONDERFUL. WE HAVE AN EXPRESSION, A SON IS A SIGN YOU GET TO WIFE, A DAUGHTER IS A DAUGHTER YOU HAVE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. WHEN YOUR DAUGHTER IS 12 AND A HALF YEARS OLD, YOU PUT A BUTTERFLY, YOU KISS HER MIDNIGHT, WHEN YOU WAKE UP, THERE IS A SNAKE IN HER BED. \"DADDY, DADDY,\" AND THEY ALL COME BACK BETWEEN 19 AND 21, AND THE CONGRESSWOMAN SAID YOU'RE NOT HYDRATING ENOUGH. I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR DAD. BUT HERE IS THE DEAL. GRANDDAUGHTERS NOT ALWAYS ONLY ALWAYS LOVE YOU, BUT THEY ALWAYS LIKE YOU. AND BY THE WAY, SHE IS IN COLLEGE, WALKING DOWN TO CAMPUS, SHE SAID \"CAN WE HOLD HANDS, POP?\" CAN YOU IMAGINE YOUR DAUGHTERS SAYING THAT. ? I LOVE YOU, GET. BY THE WAY, HER MOM IS FROM THE SOUTH SIDE. HER OTHER GRANDPARENTS LIVE IN CHICAGO, AND SHE IS A CHICAGO GIRL. ANYWAY, THANK YOU FOR A MUCH FOR INDULGING ME, REVEREND. AND I ALWAYS THANK YOU FOR REMEMBERING MY SON COME, BEAU. HE WAS A FRIEND OF YOURS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. MEMBERS OF THE CLERGY, MAYOR, THE PASSPORT TO TOWN, I APPRECIATE THAT. CONGRESSWOMAN KELLY, A GREAT CONGRESS WOMAN, AND EVERYONE HERE. THERE IS A SAYING IN SOUTH PHILLY, \"Y'ALL ARE THE ONES WHO BROUGHT ME TO THE DANCE,\" THE LABORERS, AND THAT IS NOT JOKING. HJESSE SAYS I GOT RAISED IN THE BLACK CHURCH, HE KNOWS I AM NOT KIDDING. WE WOULD SIT THERE BEFORE HE GOES OUT AND TRY TO CHANGE THINGS WHEN I WAS A KID IN COLLEGE AND A VICE. LOOK, BEFORE I START MY WHAT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEBATE WE HAD LAST NIGHT, AND I HEARD AND I LISTENED TO, AND I RESPECT SENATOR HARRIS. BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT 30 SECONDS TO 60 SECONDS ON A CAMPAIGN DEBATE CANNOT DO JUSTICE TO A LIFETIME COMMITMENT TO CIVIL RIGHTS. I WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ABOUT MY RECORD AND POSITION ON RACIAL JUSTICE, INCLUDING BUSSING. I NEVER, NEVER OPPOSE VOLUNTARY BUSING, AND AS A PROGRAM THAT SENATOR HARRIS PARTICIPATED IN AND THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE IN HER LIFE I DID SUPPORT FEDERAL OPTION TO ADDRESS ROOT CAUSES OF SEGREGATION OF HOURS WAS A COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING TAKING ON THE BANKS AND REDLINING AND TRYING TO CHANGE THE WAYS IN WHICH NEIGHBORHOODS WERE SEGREGATED. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN FAVOR OF USING FEDERAL AUTHORITY OVER STATE SEGREGATION. I CAST A VOTE IN 1974 AGAINST THE AMENDMENT ALL CALLS OF THE GURNEY AMENDMENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FEDERAL COURTS FROM USING BUSING AS A REMEDY. IT WAS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD CALL THE MOST POPULAR VOTE IN THE COUNTRY AT THE TIME. REVEREND JACKSON, WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING TOGETHER OVER THE YEARS, A LOT OF ISSUES THAT MATTER. I KNOW AND YOU KNOW THAT I THOUGHT MY HEART TO ENSURE CIVIL RIGHTS ARE ON FORCE EVERYWHERE. THESE RIGHTS ARE NOT UP TO THE STATE TO DECIDE, THEY ARE OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS TO DECIDE. IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION TO PROTECT THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, AND THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY POSITION, AND SO THAT IS WHY I RAN FOR FEDERAL OFFICE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AS REVEREND JACKSON MAY BE ONE OF THE FIRST EVIL THAN THOSE, MY CITY WAS THE ONLY CITY AFTER DR. KING WAS ASSASSINATED THAT WAS ALMOST BURNED TO THE GROUND, 20% OF IT. 19TH CENTURY CONSTRUCTION WAS OCCUPIED FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD WAS DRAWING BAYONETS ON ALMOST EVERY CORNER FOR 10 MONTHS. I CAN HOME FROM LAW SCHOOL THAT YEAR, AND I HAD TWO POLITICAL HEROES , DR. KING AND BOBBY KENNEDY, AND THEY WERE BOTH ASSASSINATED THE YEAR I GRADUATED. I CAME HOME AND HAD A JOB AT A PRECISION FIRM, AND AFTER FIVE MONTHS, I DECIDED I COULD NOT DO IT DURING WHEN I WAS ELECTED, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID WAS TO GO ON A COMMITTEE TO START TO STRENGTHEN THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT YOUR ANKLES ON CERTAIN THE ACT. I WROTE THE LAW, THE PROVISION IN THE LAW THAT ALLOWS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO PURSUE CASES INVOLVING \"A PATTERN OR PRACTICE OF CONDUCT BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL RIGHTS.\" I WROTE THAT LAW, AND I USED TO THAT POWER DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING FERGUSON. BY THE WAY, WE WORKED LIKE THE DEVIL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ALLOW LEASE APARTMENTS , POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO BUY MILITARY ITEMS LIKE HUMVEES, YOU DO NOT GO INTO NEIGHBORHOODS IN A HUMVEE OR PERSONNEL CARRIER. OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IS PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION BY 38,000 PEOPLE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, WE DID MORE IN THE PRESIDENCY THAN THE 13 PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS COMBINED. [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, WITH ALL THE RESPECT, I THINK CHICAGOANS AND EVERYONE, MY PRESIDENCY GIVES FAR TOO LITTLE CREDIT FOR ALL THAT HE DID YOUR HE IS ONE OF THE GREAT PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND I AM TIRED OF HEARING WHAT HE DID NOT DO! [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] THIS MAN HAD A BACK BONE LIKE A RAMROD. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT A PERSON IS MADE OF? WATCH THEM UNDER POLITICAL PRESSURE. HE WAS ELECTED, HE FELL OFF A CLIFF. WE HAD TO PASS AN ACT, THE RECOVERY ACT, THAT WAS $800 BILLION. AND GUESS WHAT? REMEMBER, HE LOVED DURING THE STATE OF THE UNIT TO TURN AND SURPRISE ME, HE DID NOT TELL ME, \"SHERIFF JOE IS GOING TO ENFORCE THE ACT.\" THANKS A LOT, MR. PRESIDENT. $800 BILLION. WE GET IT WITH LESS THAN 2% OF WASTE, FRAUD, OR USE IN THAT ACT. BUT HERE IS WHAT YOU GET, EVERYTHING THAT LANDED ON HIS DESK, I WATCHED HIM. I WATCHED HIM, I SAT WITH HIM EVERY SINGLE MORNING, AND I WATCHED HIM. HUNDREDS OF HOURS IN THE SO-CALLED , THE SITUATION, NOT WHERE BLITZER LIVED, THE REAL SITUATION ROOM. CHICAGO, YOU HAD A GREAT, GREAT MAN OUT HERE, AND HE IS STILL IS A GREAT MAN, AND HE'S ILL HAS A LOT TO OFFER. WE WERE IN OFFICE, WE STARTED AN INITIATIVE TO BREAK THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. FOLKS, THE DISCUSSION IN THIS RACE TODAY SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT THE PAST AND WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO BETTER, HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD, HOW WE CAN GIVE EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE SUCCESS STORIES. THESE ARE NOT SOMEBODY ELSE'S CHILDREN. THESE ARE ALL OUR CHILDREN. NOT A JOKE. THEY ARE THE KITE STRINGS THAT LIFT OUR NATIONAL AMBITIONS A LOT OF. WE HAVE TO MAKE PEOPLE REALIZE WHAT YOU ARE DOING. WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN AMERICA HAS ENORMOUS ATTENTION OF EVERY SINGLE CHILD HAS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL. BUT IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE GOOD SCHOOLS IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD. NO CHILD'S FUTURE SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY THEIR ZIP CODE. THAT IS WHY I PROPOSE INCREASING TITLE I FUNDING. WE ARE GOING TO INCREASE TEACHERS PAY. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE PRE-K A REQUIREMENT ACROSS THE BOARD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THESE SCHOOLTEACHERS WORK EVERY YEAR, LIKE MY WIFE, SHE WORKS AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE, SHE HAS NEVER STOPPED TEACHING, BY THE WAY, THE ONLY SECONDLY I KNOW WHO HAD A FULL-TIME JOB, TEACHING 15 CREDITS A SEMESTER. [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY, I AM KNOWN AS JOEILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND, BUT I EARNED IT. I ASKED HER FIVE TIMES TO MARRY ME BEFORE SHE WOULD DO IT. LOOK, THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE TEACHERS IN HERE, YOU ARE ASKED EXPECTED TO TEACH THE CHILDREN TO READ, WRITE, ADD, AND SUBTRACT, BUT KIDS COME TO SCHOOL WITH BURDENS AND PROBLEMS. WE HAVE TOO FEW SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST, TOO FEW SOCIAL WORKERS, TOO FEW PEOPLE IN THERE WORKING TO GIVE KIDS A CHANCE, AND WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT UNDER MY PROPOSAL. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] LOOK, WE ARE GOING TO DESEGREGATE OUR SCHOOLS, BECAUSE WE HAVE A NATIONAL INTEREST IN CREATING DIVERSE SCHOOL BODIES. THAT IS WHAT I BELIEVE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MOVING CLOSER TO AN IDEA OF AMERICA'S FOUNDING. YOU KNOW, WE ALL LEARNED IN SCHOOL \"WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL,\" \"WE THE PEOPLE.\" WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO THAT. WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO THAT, AND THIS IS THE 400TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN BEING BROUGHT TO THE SHORES OF THE UNITED STATES IN SLAVES. THAT IS THE ORIGINAL SIN OF THIS NATION, BUT WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT, EITHER WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THE EXPECTATION. ALL OF YOU IN THIS ROOM HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT. AND THERE IS ONE PRESIDENT I KNOW WHO HAS ACTUALLY DELIBERATELY WALKED AWAY FROM IT, AND THAT IS DONALD TRUMP. NOT A JOKE. THINK ABOUT THIS. I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT YOU, JESS, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT THAT AFTER ALL THE REST THAT HAD BEEN MADE, I WOULD SEE PEOPLE MARCHING OUT OF FIELDS, CARRYING TORCHES, CONTORTED FACES, ANGER AND HATE, ACCOMPANIED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND THE KU KLUX KLAN, MET BY DECENT, HONORABLE PEOPLE WHO SAID \"WE DON'T HATE YOU,\" AND WHAT HAPPENS? A CLASH ENSUES, A YOUNG WOMAN WHO DIED, AND WHAT DID HE SAY? WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT, HE SAID, QUOTE, NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID THIS, \"THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE IN BOTH GROUPS.\" HE HAS YET TO APOLOGIZE OR CRITICIZE , CRITICIZE THE KU KLUX KLAN AND WAS PREMISES. LOOK , WHITE SUPREMACISTS. LOOK, WE HAVE A RESIDENT WHO HAS ENCOURAGED THE POISON OF WHITE SUPREMACY. OUR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING. WHEN BARACK WAS PRESIDENT, OUR KIDS NOT ONLY COULD THEY DID LOOK UP TO HIM. LOOK, WHAT PRESIDENTS SAY MATTERS. IN MATTERS. AND BY THE WAY, WHEN WE STAY SILENT, OUR SILENCE IS COMPLICITY OR THAT IS WHERE I LEARNED FROM MY DAD. YOUR SILENCE IS COMPLICIT. YOU KNOW, I PROMISE YOU, IF I GET ELECTED RESIDENT, I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHOSE HANDS AGAINST RACISM, WHO FORCES INCLUSION AND INTOLERANT EVERYWHERE NOW SOCIETY, AND OUR INSTITUTIONS, VOTING BOOTHS, AND IN OUR HEARTS. IT MATTERS, WHAT WE SAY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO STAND BY AND START BY RECOGNIZING BLACK, HISPANIC, ASIAN AMERICAN WORKERS, NATIVE AMERICAN WORKERS, COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ALL ACROSS THE NATION THAT HAVE DRIVEN THE LABOR MOVEMENT ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, AS YOU MENTIONED, MR. PRESIDENT, A MOMENT AGO. FROM THE WASHINGTON WOMAN STRIKE IN 1880 TWO THE STRIKE AND BOYCOTT IN THE 1960'S, TO CHICAGO'S OWN ABBY WHITE AND JACQUELINE VON, BLACK AND BROWN POWER HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF THE RIGHT FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE, EQUAL POWER, AS MY DAD WOULD SAY, SOME DIGNITY, TAKING ON THE FIGHT OF ALL WORKERS, FROM FARMWORKERS WORKERS TO DOMESTIC WORKERS, TO TEARING DOWN SYSTEMIC RACISM AROUND THE WAY. WE KNOW THEM, WE OWE YOU. IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WANT YOU TO KNOW LABOR WILL HAVE AN ABSOLUTE, WILL PARTNER IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND I THINK LABOR KNOWS THAT. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, A LOT HAS CHANGED VERY BADLY, AND THIS PRESIDENT, AND SOME MEMBERS OF THE CORPORATE COMMUNITY BELIEVE THAT , I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR , WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD AMERICA. STOCKBROKERS AND HEDGE FUND MANAGERS DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY. YOU BUILD THIS COUNTRY. THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS, THE UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS, THAT IS WHY IT EXISTS. WE NEED TO REBUILD IT! BUT THIS TIME, WE HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG, NO MATTER THEIR RACE OR GENDER, ETHNICITY, RELIGION, WHO THEY LOVE, WHERE THEY LIVE, OR WHETHER THEY HAD A DISABILITY. MY DAD HAD AN EXPRESSION, JOE, YOU TALK A LOT MORE ABOUT A PAYCHECK, AND HE MEANT IT. HE SAID, JOE, IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, IS ABOUT RESPECT IN THE COMMUNITY, IT IS ABOUT LOOKING YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY HONEY, IT IS TO BE OK, AND HE OR TOO FEW PEOPLE, AS HAS BEEN REFERENCED TODAY, THINK THEY CAN SAY THAT TODAY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE ARE SHRINKING. THEY NO LONGER BELIEVE THEIR CHILDREN WILL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY. MR. PRESIDENT, YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW YOUR DAD PERSISTED AND CHANGED THINGS. AND IN TODAY'S CORPORATE CULTURE, IN THIS ADMINISTRATION, THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. THEY CARE ABOUT BREAKING THE BACK OF WORKERS AND RECORD PROFITS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES, CORPORATE PROFITS ARE GOING TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND BLOCKBUSTER EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THEY ARE SWEEPING THE LIFE OUT OF WORKERS TODAY. AND BY THE WAY, MAKING IT HARD TO MEET BASIC NEEDS. THERE HAS LONG BEEN A WAR ON LABOR UNIONS. AS WHEN IT OUT TODAY, MR. CHAIRMAN, Y'ALL ARE COMING BACK, BUT HERE IS THE DEAL, THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER WAR GOING ON THAT HAS NOT BEEN NOTICED VERY MUCH, ON THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS BE ABLE TO BARGAIN FOR THEIR SELF-WORTH. 40% OF WORKERS TODAY HAVE TO SIGN A NONCOMPETE AGREEMENT. IT IS ONE THING TO HAVE ACCESS SECRETS OF A GREAT, TECHNICAL ORGANIZATION TO SIGN, I WON'T COMPLAIN. ETE. BUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE PEOPLE ARE HOURLY WORKERS. UP UNTIL I STARTED HOLLERING ABOUT THIS, IF YOU WORKED FOR JIMMY JOHN'S, YOU HAD TO SIGN A NONCOMPETE AGREEMENT IS THAT YOU WOULD NOT WHILE CROSS TOWN AND TRY TO GET $.10 MORE FROM MCDONALD'S. WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? IT IS ONLY ONE PURPOSE, TO HOLD DOWN THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS EVEN TO BARGAIN FOR THEIR OWN SELF WORTH. IT IS TO KEEP WAGES LOW, AND IT IS WRONG. TOO MANY COMPANIES TODAY CLASSIFY THEIR WORKERS AS MANAGERS, WHEN LABOR FOUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU ARE AN HOURLY WORKER, YOU HAD TO BE PAID OVERTIME. WHAT DID THEY DO? THE PERSON STACKING SPAGHETTI CANS ON TOP OF A SHELF IN A SUPERMARKET, BUT YOU CONTROL THE PERSON WHO WANTS A FORKLIFT, TO BRING IT OUT, THEY SAY YOU ARE NOW A MANAGER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT CAUGHT MORE THAN 400 MILLION WORKERS $1.2 BILLION LAST YEAR. WHERE DID IT GO? IT WENT BACK INTO THE POCKET OF AMERICA, BACK INTO THE SO-CALLED JOB HATERS. SINCE WHEN , JOB CREATORS. SINCE WHEN? SINCE WHEN WERE THEY JOB CREATORS? TODAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE ONLY ONES I THINK OUR JOB CREATORS ARE STOCKBROKERS. IT IS RIDICULOUS. IT IS LONG PAST TIME WE HAVE A $15 MINIMUM WAGE. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] LONG PAST TIME. IT REALLY IS. AND WE ARE GETTING IT DONE AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE NEED TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT JUST WAGES, NOT JUST WELL. =, WEALTH. WAGES HAVE TO BE REWARDED. DO YOU REALIZE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE MULTIMILLIONAIRES AND PAY CAPITAL GAINS GET A LOWER TAX RATE THAN ANY OF YOU ALL DO? LOOK, IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL IMMEDIATELY REPEAL THE TAX CUT FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. WE HAVE $1.6 TRILLION IN LOOP HOLES THAT EXIST IN THE LOGOUT. $1.6 TRILLION. YOU CANNOT JUSTIFY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT. AND SO, FOLKS, LOOK, WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS USE THE MONEY TO INVEST IN AMERICA'S FUTURE. THERE IS AN INCREDIBLY LONG LIST OF POLICIES THAT I DO NOT HAVE TIME NOR DO YOU HAVE AN INCLINATION FOR ME TO GO THROUGH. BUT WE NEED AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY, FOR BETTER ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES, TO REDUCING THE DECLINE IN BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP AMONG TO MAKING SURE HOMES IN BLACK COMMUNITIES ARE VALUED FAIRLY. DO YOU REALIZE A HOME , I KNOW YOU DO , A SAME HOME IN A PREDOMINANTLY BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD AND ONE IN A WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD, IT IS VALUED AT SIGNIFICANTLY LESS, LIMITING YOUR ABILITY TO BORROW AGAINST IT, TO DO MUCH ABOUT IT, AND GUESS WHAT? YOU PAY A HIGHER INSURANCE RATES FOR IT, TO. O. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE BLACK MOTHERS REAL CONFIDENT WHEN THEY SENT THEIR SON OUT ON THE STREET THAT THEY WILL BE SAFE. WE'VE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT KID WEARING A HOODIE MAY VERY WELL BE THE NEXT POET LAUREATE AND NOT A GANG BANGER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE ARE TOO MANY BLACK MEN, AND I MIGHT ADD WOMEN, IN PROSISON. I JUST MET WITH BOBBY SCOTT FROM VIRGINIA. THE SAVE JUSTICE ACT. IT NEEDS TO BE PASSED. WE NEED TO DO MORE. NO MORE MINIMUM MANDATORY PRISON SENTENCES, PERIOD. THE END OF PRIVATE PRISONS, AS BARACK AND I TALKED ABOUT. [APPLAUSE] FINDING. DRUG COURTS. AT LEAST $400 MILLION A YEAR. THEY'LL REFORM. NO ONE SHOULD BE IN JAIL BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY THEIR BAIL. NO JUVENILES IN PRISON. MANDATORY TREATMENT, NOT JAIL, FOR THOSE AFFECTED BY AND STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL. PUT THEM IN TREATMENT AND KEEP THEM THERE WHILE THEY ARE GOING THROUGH TREATMENT. DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA. AUTOMATICALLY EXPUNGE MARIJUANA CONVICTIONS. [APPLAUSE] AND FINALLY, END THE CRACK COCAINE DISPARITY SO IT IS 1-1, NO DIFFERENCE. TOO MANY AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE BEEN PUT IN JAIL FOR IT. LOOK, WHAT I DO NOT GET, AND WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE THE CASE, IF YOU MAKE IT FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE, THEY FIGURE IT OUT. IN PRISON, YOU SHOULD RECEIVE AN EDUCATION, NOT HOW TO BE A BETTER CRIMINAL, BUT YOU SHOULD LEARN HOW TO READ AND WRITE. THERE SHOULD BE JOB PROGRAMS IN THERE. WE SHOULD BE TRAINING PEOPLE. WE SHOULD BE TRAINING THEM. WE SHOULD HAVE AUTOMATIC RESTORATION OF RIGHTS ONCE THEIR SENTENCE AND HERBS, INCLUDING ALL RIGHTS TO GO TO SCHOOL, HELP RISK, NOT ONLY THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE, BUT THE OVERWHELMING INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES AND EVERY CITIZEN, BLACK OR WHITE OR HIS, THAT YOU REEDUCATE PEOPLE, GIVE THEM A CHANCE. POST MALONE, WE CAN DO ALL OF THESE THINGS, AND SO MUCH MORE. I KNOW WE GET CRITICIZED FOR SAYING WE CAN UNITE THE COUNTRY, BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I REFUSE TO CONTINUE THE STATUS QUO. IT GUARANTEES IT WILL CONTINUE. WE CANNOT DO IT. YOU KNOW, I KNOW HOW THE LABOR LEADERS MOVEMENT HAS MOVED FOR DECADES. THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO WIN IN 2020, AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN TOGETHER WHEN WE DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] AND FOLKS, REV, I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S FUTURE, AND I MEAN IT. I MEAN IT. YOU KNOW THERE IS, EXCUSE ME FOR QUOTING AND I WAS ON, A GUY NAMED SHAMUSSEAMUS HANEY RAUNER: ABOUT THE SUPPRESSION OF CATHOLICS IN IRELAND, AND HE WROTE \"WE ARE TAUGHT NEVER TO HOPE ON THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE, BUT THEN ONCE IN A LONG TIME, THAT LONG TITLE WAVE OF US THIS RISES UP AND HOPE THAT HISTORY WINS. FOLKS, WE ARE IN A POSITION NOW WHERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAS THE THE VERY DARK SIDE OF AMERICA. EVERY GENERATION IS SAYING \"ENOUGH.\" WE HAVE A CHANCE, A REAL CHANCE, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOTHING WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO IF WE ARE UNITED IN IT. YOU KNOW ALL THOSE LINES EVERYBODY REMEMBERS FROM JOHN KENNEDY'S SPEECHES FROM GOING TO THE MOON? HE SAID \"THIS IS A CHALLENGE WE ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT,\" WITH THE LOVE LINE I LOVE MOST, HE SAID, \"WE ARE UNWILLING TO POSTPONE.\" \"WE ARE UNWILLING TO POSTPONE.\" I AM UNWILLING TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER THE INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE, SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE, PICK OUR HEADS UP, AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND GOD BLESS OUR. TROOPS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN! [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] WE ARE NOT DONE YET AND HOW MANY OF YOU ARE HUNGRY? REVEREND MARVIN HUNTER, IF YOU CAN COME TO THE STAGE TO GIVE GRACE COME UP LESS FOOD. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO THIS PROGRAM, SO PLEASE KEEP YOUR SPACE. DO NOT LEAVE YET.

AS FAR AS THOSE WHO WILL BE JOINING HIM AT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL, WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE A VIP AREA FOR WHITE HOUSE GUEST. THAT WILL BE GOVERNMENT , OFFICIALS, FAMILY MEMBERS, CABINET AND FAMILY. NOTE TO MARSHALLTOWN, IOWA. DR. JILL BIDEN IS SPEAKING NOW. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, THE BIDENS ARE A MILITARY FAMILY. MY FATHER WAS IN WORLD WAR II. OUR SON SERVED IN IRAQ AS A MEMBER OF THE DELAWARE ARMY NATIONAL GUARD. I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF NATIONAL GUARD FAMILIES HERE. HOW MANY NATIONAL GUARD ARE IN HERE? HOW MANY MILITARY ARE IN HERE TODAY? [APPLAUSE] TODAY WHEN WE CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF OUR COUNTRY, I OFTEN THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO DEFEND OUR LIBERTY WITH THEIR LIVES. IT IS NOT JUST THOSE WHO SERVED IN THE ARMED FORCES. IT IS THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL. EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T WEAR A UNIFORM, THEY ALSO SERVE. TODAY, I JUST GOT TO TOUR THE IOWA VETERANS,. [APPLAUSE] THE COMMANDANT AND HIS TEAM ARE REALLY DOING A GREAT JOB CREATING A COMMUNITY THAT RECOGNIZES THE PERSONAL SPECIFIC NEEDS OF EACH VETERAN IN THE VETERANS HOME. I WAS GRATEFUL TO , I ALSO MET MARK SMITH WHO JOINED ME , IS HE IN THE BACK? [APPLAUSE] THE COMMANDANT CALLED THE VETERANS HOME THE JEWEL OF IOWA. I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY A NICE WAY TO PHRASE IT. I WANTED TO PUT THAT IN MY SPEECH. I THOUGHT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A SPECIAL PLACE. JOE SAYS WE ONLY HAVE ONE SACRED OBLIGATION AND THAT IS TO BE FAMILIES WHO HAVE SERVED IN THE MILITARY. HERE IN MARSHALLTOWN, YOU ARE SETTING AN EXAMPLE THAT WE SHOULD MODEL AROUND THE COUNTRY AT THE IOWA VETERANS HOME. AFTER THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, SO MANY PEOPLE KEPT COMING UP TO ME AT A, IN THE GROCERY STORE, AND THEY SAID THE SAME THING. WE MISS JOE. TELL HIM TO RUN. [LAUGHTER] PEOPLE SAID THEY MISSED HIS DEEP EXPERIENCE WITH WORKING WITH OUR ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS NOT JUST THAT THEY MISS THE KIND OF LEADER THAT HE IS. THEY MISS HIS DECISIVE CHARACTER. HIS KINDNESS. HIS EXPERIENCE AND ABILITY TO UNITE US. THE WAY HE INSPIRES US TO KEEP BELIEVING THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US, NOT BEHIND US. AFTER CHARLOTTESVILLE, THERE WAS A NEW URGENCY TO THE WORDS I KEPT HEARING. WE NEED HIM, JOE HAS TO RUN. WHEN WE HEAR ON THE NEWS TODAY, WE ARE TOLD THAT WE HAVE NEVER BEEN SUBDIVIDED. WE ARE TOLD THAT OUR DIFFERENCES ARE IRRECONCILABLE AND THAT THERE IS A WAR BETWEEN THEM AND US. WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN HOW HATRED AND BIGOTRY HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS, TORCHES IN HAND, CHILDREN ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES AT THE BORDER. OUR PROGRESS IS SLIPPING AWAY. WOMEN'S RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS, OUR ENVIRONMENT. SO MUCH IS AT STAKE. AND YET, I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE VISION ARE WRONG. WHEN I TRAVEL ACROSS THIS NATION, I SEE HOPE. I SEE PEOPLE WHO CARE, LIKE ALL OF YOU. I SEE PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES WHO COME TOGETHER TO STAND BESIDE EACH OTHER TO LIFT UP ONE ANOTHER. THAT IS THE AMERICA THAT JOE BIDEN IS FIGHTING FOR. [APPLAUSE] JUST BY YOUR BEING HERE, I KNOW THAT THAT IS HOW YOU CARE ABOUT AMERICA ALSO. IN JUST A FEW YEARS, SO MANY OF US HAVE LOST THE FAITH AND OUR INSTITUTIONS AND IN OUR POLITICIANS. TODAY, WE MUST CHOOSE A PATH FORWARD. ONE OF DIVISION OR ONE OF DECENCY. ONE OF OPTIMISM OR ONE OF FEAR. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE CHOICES ARE ENORMOUS. THEY COULD CHANGE THE PATH WE CHOOSE FOR YEARS TO COME. AND YET, IT IS THE LITTLE MIRACLES THAT RESTORE MY FAITH. LAST WEEKEND, I MET COMMUNITY ORGANIZERS WHO DECIDED TO RUN FOR OFFICE. YOUNG PEOPLE BELIEVING IN A BETTER TOMORROW WHO MOVED TO IOWA TO WORK ON THE CAUCUSES. TEACHERS, AND I'M A TEACHER , [APPLAUSE] GIVING FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. VOLUNTEERS GIVING THEIR PRECIOUS TIME TO ORGANIZE THEIR PRECINCTS AREA PEOPLE WHO OUTRIGHT REJECT THE CYNICISM AND COMPLACENCY THAT IS SO TEMPTING AT TIMES. PEOPLE LIKE MY HUSBAND, JOE BIDEN. JOE'S FAITH IN GOD, AND OUR COMMUNITIES, IN THE BOUNDLESS POTENTIAL OF THE AMERICAN IDEAL IS UNSHAKABLE. HIS FAITH IS THAT WE WILL NEVER STOP WORKING TO BE GREATER. THAT OUR COURAGE AND CONVICTIONS WILL LIVE OUT IN THE END IF WE ARE ALL UNIFIED. JOE BELIEVES THAT TOGETHER, THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE CAN'T DO. THAT IS WHY WE MUST ELECT JOE BIDEN TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO END TODAY BY SAYING THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR SHOWING UP ON YOUR HOLIDAY. THANK YOU FOR CARING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR FAITH IN BELIEVING IN THIS IDEA THAT IS BIGGER THAN ALL OF US. THAT WE CAN BUILD A BETTER NATION TOGETHER. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE ON OUR FOURTH OF JULY AND I HOPE JOE AND I GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. NOW, IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE OUR NEXT GUEST TO THE STAGE. HE HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB LEADING THE TOWN AS LEADER OF MARSHALLTOWN. I HAVE ALSO HEARD HE HAS BEEN BUSY OUTSIDE OF WORK AS WELL. SINCE NOT ONE BUT TWO OF HIS DAUGHTERS ARE GETTING MARRIED THIS SUMMER AND FALL. [LAUGHTER] PLEASE HELP ME TO CONGRATULATE AND WELCOME MAYOR JOE GREER. MAYOR GREER: I AM ACCUSTOMED TO DOING THIS WITH A LEGAL PAD. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO KEEP THIS BRIEF AND THAT'S DIFFICULT FOR A TRIAL LAWYER TO DO. [LAUGHTER] THERE IS SOME INTERESTING BACKGROUND SIMILAR BETWEEN JOE BIDEN AND MAY. WE BOTH GREW UP IN AND I , IRISH CATHOLIC FAMILY. WE BOTH HAD ASTHMA AS CHILDREN AREA WE BOTH PLAYED FOOTBALL, WIDE RECEIVER AND HAVE ASKED. , HALF BACK. WE BOTH REGULATED WITH A MEDICAL SCIENCE DEGREE. WE BOTH WENT TO LAW SCHOOL. WE BOTH WORKED ON THE CITY COUNCIL. HIS FAMILY AND HOURS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY CANCER. I HAVE DONE THIS A LOT. I CRY ABOUT HALF THE TIME AND INTERVIEWS AND AS CONFERENCES. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. [APPLAUSE] IT STARTED WITH THE TORNADO AND IT HASN'T STOPPED. WE BELIEVE INTO THINGS. ONE IS TO HAVE A BALANCED JUDICIARY. WE NEED A PRESIDENT THAT BALANCES OUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. [APPLAUSE] MAYOR GREER: FINALLY, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I WENT TO WASHINGTON 15 YEARS IN A ROW TO LOBBY WITH THE CANCER SOCIETY TO GET MORE FUNDING. JOE BIDEN AND BARACK OBAMA, WE GOT THAT DONE. OUR FAMILY HAS PEOPLE WHO HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE INSURANCE IF WE DID NOT HAVE THAT. BLESS THEM FOR THAT. [APPLAUSE] MAYOR GREER: I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR PAST VICE PRESIDENT AND MAYBE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO CANCER OR ARE FIGHTING IT NOW? THAT IS WHY YOU ALL KNOW, IT NEVER FUNDAMENTALLY GOES AWAY. THAT IS WHY I THINK FOR JILL AND ME, AND FOR THE MAYOR HIMSELF, WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT IT, YOU RELIVE IT IMMEDIATELY. WE ARE MAKING ENORMOUS PROGRESS. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO SEE TO IT THAT WE AND CANCER AS WE KNOW IT AND WE CAN DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] MR. MAYOR, WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON AND OUR BACKGROUNDS EXCEPT I ONLY HAD ONE DAUGHTER THAT MARRIED AT ONE TIME AREA. YOU HAVE TO. WHAT WILL WHILE. YOU THINK I'M KIDDING BUT , THE COUNTY DEMOCRATIC CHAIR SAID INSIDE THAT IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THANKLESS JOB IN AMERICAN POLITICS BUT THANK YOU FOR DOING IT. I ALSO WANT TO THANK JIM, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UAW. WE HAVE AN EXPRESSION IN DELAWARE THAT IS THE UAW IS THE ONE THAT PROBABLY TO THE DANCE. IN THE EARLY DAYS, WE HAD THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF UAW WORKERS OF ANY STATE INCLUDING MICHIGAN. IT IS SUCH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR WORKERS IN SUCH A SMALL STATE. WHERE THE LARGEST GM PLANT OUTSIDE OF DETROIT AND THE SECOND , A ARE ALL GONE NOW. THEY ARE THE FIRST OUTFIT TO ENDORSE THIS 29-YEAR-OLD KID WHEN I RAN. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE UFC W. ROGER IS THE PRESIDENT AND THEY DID A COUPLE GREAT MONTHS LATELY. PARTICULARLY IN MASSACHUSETTS. STICK WITH THEM, WE ARE COMING BACK. I MAKE NO APOLOGIES, I MAY UNION GUY. [APPLAUSE] I THINK PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO REALIZE IS THAT WHAT AMERICA WORKERS ARE BEGINNING TO REALIZE IS THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A 40 HOUR WEEK, SO WE OWE YOU. [APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN CANNOT IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN IOWA CELEBRATING INDEPENDENCE DAY. SUCH AN INCREDIBLE PROMISE FOR AMERICA'S FUTURE. IT WAS OVER 200 YEARS AGO GUYS PLEDGED THEIR LIVES AND HONOR , FORTUNES AND THEIR SACRED HONOR TO A REVOLUTIONARY IDEA. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. WE LEARN ALL THAT IN SCHOOL. EVER SINCE THEN, PRESIDENTS AND PATRIOTS HAVE GATHERED TO REFLECT ON WHAT THE GREATER MEETING OF THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT IS. JUST AFTER THE REVOLUTION JOHN QUINCY ADAMS CLAIMED AMERICA'S GLORY IS NOT DOMINION, BUT LIBERTY. IN 1861, ABRAHAM LINCOLN VOTED TO MAKE THE CASE FOR THE CIVIL WAR, REMINDING CONGRESS THERE WILL BE STRUGGLED TO MAINTAIN THE WARRIOR , THE WORLD WHOSE MEANING IS TO ELEVATE THE CONDITION OF ALL MEN. I KNOW IT IS HIGH SOUNDING WORDS HE LEARNED IN SCHOOL, BUT IT IS HOW IT SUPPOSED TO BE. 1962, I WAS GETTING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND JOHN QUINCY THE CLARITY THIS NATION CONCEIVED BY LIBERTY AND MATURING INDEPENDENCE AS NO INTENTION OF ADVOCATING ITS LEADERSHIP TO ANY SOCIETY COMMITTED TO SYSTEMATIC HUMAN OPPRESSION. WE ARE UNITED IN THE FACE AND THE POWER OF THIS IDEA, CONSTANT DEDICATION TO PURSUE HUMANKIND'S HIGHEST A DEAL WHICH IS LIBERTY. I WONDERED, WHAT WOULD DONALD TRUMP SAY THIS EVENING? WHEN HE SPEAKS TO THE NATION IN AN EVENT DESIGNED TO STROKE HIS EGO MORE THAN AMERICA'S IDEALS. WILL HE OFFER DEMOCRATIC VALUES TO STRENGTHEN THE TIMES IN CRISIS? HE IS INCAPABLE OF CELEBRATING WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK HE GETS IT. [APPLAUSE] HE HAS TROUBLE DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN OUR ENEMIES AND OUR ALLIES BECAUSE HE DOESN'T UNDERGIRD , HE DOESN'T GRASP GREATER UNDERSTANDING, THE PURSUIT OF FULFILLMENT. IF DONALD TRUMP HAS EIGHT YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE HE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE NATION. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] WHETHER OR NOT I'M NO NOMINEE , I'M GOING TO WORK TO SEE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU CAN RECALL SOMEONE WHO EMBRACES DICTATORS AND OBJECTS TO EVERYTHING OUR FOUNDERS WROTE ABOUT. KIM JONG-UN, FOOD AND, MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN , PUTIN COME UP MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN , KIM JONG-UN, PUTIN, MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN. [NO AUDIO] LAST WEEK, AND HE GAVE AN INTERVIEW WHERE HE SAID THE WESTERN IDEAL HAS BECOME OBSOLETE, BUT HERE IS TRUMP'S RESPONSE. DONALD TRUMP THOUGHT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRATS IN CALIFORNIA. NOT A JOKE. OUR PRESIDENT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES IN A POLITICAL CONTEXT. HE DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR IT. THE LIBERAL IDEA IS AN AMERICAN IDEAL. WE HAVE PATRIOTS COMMITTED TO LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT ON THE FOURTH OF JULY. THE LIBERAL IDEA IS WHAT DRIVES ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION. IT INSPIRES ART, EXPLORATION, HUMAN CURIOSITY. THAT IS WHAT WE MEAN AND CRITICALLY, IT IS WHAT BUILT THE FREE WORLD. IT IS AN AMERICAN DESIGN TO HOLD IN CHECK ABUSES OF POWER BY ANYONE NATION, A FIRM A COLLECTIVE DEFENSE, OPEN ECONOMIES, HUMAN RIGHTS. THAT IS WHY THERE IS NATO MUST SO NO SINGLE NATION COULD STEP OUT AND ABUSE POWER. THE FREE WORLD DROVE THE MARK , MARCH OF DEMOCRACY. IT ALLOWED UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC GROWTH THE WORLD HAD NEVER SEEN. BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOM IN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD. THAT IS WHY PUTIN WANTS TO DESTROY IT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AMERICA IS THE HEART OF THE FREE WORLD. THAT IS NOT A HYPERBOLE. WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT HEART BEATING STRONGLY AND DEFEND IT. THAT IS HOW THE FOURTH OF JULY IS BEST HONORED, REMEMBERING OUR DECLARATION IS THE CALL TO ARMS IN THE DEFENSE AGREEMENT. JFK PUT IT BEST WHEN HE SAID OURS IS NOT AN INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY OF ONE, IT IS INDIVISIBLE LIBERTY OF ALL. I HONESTLY GOD DON'T BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP GET EITHER ONE OF THOSE CONCEPTS. MY LIBERTY DEPENDS ON YOURS. OUR LIBERTY RESTS ON OUR ABILITY TO ENSURE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY NOT JUST FOR OUR OWN CHILDREN, BUT ALL CHILDREN. WE ALL BENEFIT WHEN ALL OF HER CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS. WE HAVE TO TAKE ON THE EQUITIES OF OUR SYSTEM THAT ARE CAUSING TOO MANY TODAY TO QUESTION THEIR FAITH AND THEIR DEMOCRACY TO DELIVER FOR THEM. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO BE AGAINST THE WAY DONALD TRUMP CONDUCTS SELF. AND\/OR KNOWS WHO HE IS. THE WAY HE INSULTS WOMEN, POOR PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO BE AGAINST HIS POLICIES THAT ARE CREATING DIVISION. [APPLAUSE] QUITE FRANKLY, THOSE POLICIES ARE RIGGING THE SYSTEM AGAINST THE LOWER CLASS AND WORKING CLASS. THE MAJORITY OF AMERICA NO LONGER BELIEVE THEIR CHILDREN WILL HAVE THE LIFE THAT THEY HAD , A BETTER LIFE THAN THEY HAD. THAT TOO IS AN ATTACK ON OUR DEMOCRACY WHEN THAT HAPPENS. I KNOW THEY CALL ME LOW CLASS JOE, BUT I KNOW WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY. IT WAS THE NO CLASS. THAT IS THE MESSAGE I HAVE BEEN CARRYING ACROSS THE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE AND IT IS CLEAR TODAY ON A DAY WE CELEBRATE INDEPENDENCE. OUR COUNTRY WAS NOT BUILT BY WALL STREET CEOS, HEDGE FUND MANAGERS, IT WAS BUILT BY ALL OF YOU. GIVEN HAVE A CHANCE, THINK ABOUT THIS. AMERICA HAS GIVEN HALF A CHANCE HAVE NEVER LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN, NOT ONE TIME IN HISTORY IN WAR OR PEACE. THAT IS THE HISTORY OF AMERICA, GIVING REAL PEOPLE REALTY IS. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. HE WAS A WHITE-COLLAR WORKER AND EVERY TIME WE MOVED BACK TO DELAWARE, HE SAID JOEY, THE JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, RESPECT ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY, BEING ABLE TO LOCATE YOUR CHILD AND SAY IT WILL BE OK AND MEAN IT. TODAY, SOME PEOPLE CAN'T DO THAT . THAT IS MY NORTH STAR. I THINK WE HAVE TO BOOT , REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS AND BRING EVERYBODY ALONE THE MATTER THEIR RACE, RELIGION, WHO THEY LOVE. ME, IT IS ABOUT RESTORING THE DIGNITY OF WORK, PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE SECURITY AND JOY FOR THEIR FAMILIES. HOW CAN A PERSON MAINTAIN DIGNITY IF THEY CAN AFFORD TO CARE FOR THEIR SICK CHILD OR FAMILY MEMBER? THINK ABOUT IT. HOW CAN YOU SUSTAIN YOUR DIGNITY IF YOUR CHILD HAS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION? HOW CAN YOU MAINTAIN YOUR DIGNITY WHEN YOUR CHILD IS SUFFERING FROM AN INTERNAL DISEASE? I CAN'T IMAGINE COMING BACK FROM IRAQ WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF TERMINAL CANCER. I CANNOT FATHOM WHAT IT WAS LIKE LOOKING AT OUR WIFE AND TWO GRANDKIDS IF THEY HAD SAID TIME'S UP, THE LAST FOUR MONTHS YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. THINK ABOUT IT. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THAT. HOW CAN A PARENT MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNITY IF THEIR CHILD HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL, BUT CAN'T AFFORD TO GET THEM THERE. MY DAD HAD A GOOD JOB. A HOUSE, FOR KIDS AND MY MOM AND DAD. IT WAS A HAPPY PLACE. I LOOK BACK AND EITHER UNDERSTAND WHY MOM WOULD MOVE , WOULD NEVER MOVE IT TO ME , MOVED IN WITH ME AFTER MY DAD PASSED AWAY ALL STOP I REMEMBER WHEN MY MY FATHER FELT WHEN I COULD GET IN THE COLLEGE AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. HE SAID I'M SO ASHAMED. I'LL NEVER FORGET THE LOOK IN HIS FACE. LOOK IT FOR PEOPLE TODAY. HOW MANY OF YOU ARE HAVING A DISCUSSION TODAY WITH WHAT IS GOING ON IN CHINA. HOW MANY ARE YOU GOING TO SAY YOU CAN'T GO BACK NEXT SEMESTER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. THEY DON'T CARE ON THE , ABOUT THE DIGNITY. THEY ARE SQUEEZING THE LIFE OUT OF WORKERS AND MAKING IT HARDER AND HARDER. 40% OF WORKERS HAVE TO DO IS , HAVE TO SIGN A NONCOMPETE AGREEMENT. THEY HAVE ONE PURPOSE. TO HOLD DOWN WAGES. JIMMY JOHN'S, YOU HAVE TO SIGN YOU CAN'T COMPETE. YOU COULD NOT GO ACROSS TOWN TO GET $.20 MORE WORKING AT MCDONALD'S OR ANY WORLD. WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN SUPPRESSING WAGES AND INCREASING PROFITS FOR CORPORATIONS? FOR SIMPLE REASON. SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY OVERTIME. IT COST MORE THAN 4 MILLION HOURLY WORKERS $1.2 BILLION. 4 MILLION WORKERS WHO ARE RECLASSIFIED OR HAD TO SIGN NONCOMPETE AGREEMENTS. $1.2 BILLION LAST GOING TO THEM. HIGHEST PROFIT RATES THEY EVER HAD. USED TO BE A BASIC BARGAIN. TO HOW THAT IS HAPPENING TODAY. SPEAKING OF OVERTIME, IT IS LONG PAST TIME TO BE A $15 FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. FOLKS, IT IS TIME WE START TO AWARD WORK OVER WEALTH IN THE COUNTRY. THE STOCK MARKET IS ROARING. HOW HAS IT AFFECTED YOUR LIVES? HAS , IS IT REALLY MOVING? HOW ABOUT THE TRUMP TAX CUT? DO YOU FEEL IT? YOU WILL FILL IT . IT COSTS ALMOST $2 TRILLION. WE WILL HAVE TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICAID, NOT A JOKE. FOLKS, IT IS A SHAM. THEY HAVE ALREADY SAID IT. WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN, SO WE NEED THE REVENUE THAT TRUMP HAS PUT IN THE WRONG HANDS OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T NEED THE HELP. AS I SAY TO WEALTHY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, THE LAST PEOPLE WHO NEED A TAX CUT ARE PEOPLE MAKING $10 MILLION OR MORE PER YEAR. [APPLAUSE] SECONDLY, WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE CAPITAL GAINS LOOPHOLES. AN ECONOMY THAT ADVANCES THE ECONOMY IS NOT , MAKING LESS THAN A FIREFIGHTER OR TEACHER. YOU COULD BE MAKING $200 MILLION AND PAY A LOWER TAX RATE THAN SOMEONE TEACHING IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. ALSO, AN IMPORTANT LESSON WE LEARNED. BEN FRANKLIN SUPPOSEDLY SAID THIS. HE SAID WE MUST ALL HANG TOGETHER FOR MOST ASSUREDLY WE WILL ALL HANG SEPARATELY. THAT IS MY MESSAGE TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND PEOPLE WANT TO SEE A CHANGE. WE NEED TO UNIFY THE COUNTRY AND OVERCOME THE STATUS QUO. [APPLAUSE] WE REALLY HAVE TO. I KNOW SOME DEMOCRATS SAY NO COMPROMISE WILL STOP WE CAN COMPROMISE WITHOUT COMPROMISING OUR PRINCIPLES. THE WADE WHICH HE DEALT WITH THIS, YOU CAME TOGETHER AND MUCH MORE THAT HAS TO BE DONE, BUT WORKING TOGETHER, YOU ARE WELL ON YOUR WAY, BUT THIS IS THE PLACE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ALSO BE MORE DEEPLY ENGAGED. WHEN YOU ARE WORKING WITH FOLKS, ALL THAT MATTERED IS GETTING MARSHALLTOWN BACK ON ITS FEET. IT GOES TO SLOW AND ALL THAT STANDS IN THE WAY IS A BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM. FOR ALL OUR PROBLEMS, I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY THEN WHEN I RAN AND GOT ELECTED TO THE SENATE. THEY REAPPORTIONED MY DISTRICT TO ABOUT 70% AND SO I DECIDED TO GET IN OR GET OUT. HERE'S WHY I THINK I'M ALL , SO OPTIMISTIC. I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE POSITION TODAY THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE. FOLKS, REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY, NO ONE IS CLOSE. OUR MILITARY IS BIGGER THAN THE NEXT SEVEN. PEOPLE LOOK TO AMERICA BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, NOT THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER. WE ARE AMERICA'S ENERGY INDEPENDENT. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES HERE IN IOWA AND ALL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED AND EVERY MAJOR FUNDAMENTAL BREAKER HAS COME OUT OF THOSE UNIVERSITIES MONETIZED BY BUSINESSES. NO OTHER NATION CAN MATCH IF WE REMEMBER WHO WE ARE AND INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE. THE ONLY THING BACK IN TERROR AMERICA APART IS CIRCUIT ITSELF AND THAT IS WHAT IS TRYING TO BE DONE RIGHT NOW TO MAINTAIN POWER, SEPARATE US BASED ON RACE, NATURAL ORIGIN, BASED ON RELIGION. THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES THE LIBERAL IDEA OBSOLETE BUSINESS IF WE WALK AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE. EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE HAVE TO SHOW THEM WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A NATION THAT WILLED OURSELVES IN EXISTENCE WITH NOTHING BUT THE POWER OF AN IDEA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SOLITARY THING WE CAN'T DO. NOTHING, NOT A JOKE. THERE'S NOTHING WE SET OUR MIND TO AS A NATION THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO. I REMEMBER FROM THE TIME THAT I WAS A KID TO WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL TO TODAY, THE ONE THAT GOT ME THE MOST WAS THE PHRASE HE USED, HE WAS ASKED WHY DO YOU DO THIS AND HE SAID I REFUSE TO POSTPONE, LEADING THE TREE , LEADING THE COUNTRY TO MOVE. MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU. WE CAN DO THIS. I PROMISE YOU. [APPLAUSE] [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATIONS] I WAS DOWN IN MIAMI AND ASKING WHEN IS JOE TAPING? YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE BROOM SMASHING GLASS? I GAVE THAT TO YOU AND I WAS CITY. YOU SMASH ON THE GROUND AND THEN WE PRAY TO LINCOLN TO HEAL IT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SMASHED THE GLASS THE GLASS. MY NAME IS SARAH, AND I KNOW THEY TALKED ABOUT THIS, BUT I AM A SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND I WAS AT THE BRETT KAVANAUGH HEARING AND TO SEE SOMEONE SO UNFIT IN THIS UP IN COURT IS DEVASTATING, AND I AM CONCERNED, WITH EVERYTHING TALKED ABOUT TODAY, IMMIGRATION, EVERYTHING , WELL, THANK YOU. I MEAN, I THINK I AM, IT'S JUST, IT DOES BRING IT BACK, AND I AM VERY CONCERNED, NOT JUST DONALD TRUMP BUT A DECADE-LONG STRATEGY ON THE PART OF THE GOP TO APPOINT PEOPLE LIKE CAVANAUGH , KAVANAUGH. AGAIN, GUESS WHAT? WE HAD A BIPARTISAN BILL PASSED WITH $740 MILLION TO CHANGE THE CIRCUMSTANCES, TO CUT IT OUT. IT MAKES NO SENSE NOT TO. YOU CAN'T TURN ON A LIGHT SWITCH, WHEN THERE'S NO LIGHT. WE CAN CHANGE THIS. JOE. JOE.

I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE PAROL IN PLACE AGREEMENT TO NOT DEPORT THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF OUR MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON DEPLOYMENT.

OUR SOLDIERS ARE DEFENDING OUR COUNTRY, AND THEIR FAMILIES DESERVE THE PROTECTION OF THIS COUNTRY. SENATOR REID. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND FOR JOINING US AND CONGRATULATIONS ON WHAT I THINK WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL NEW JOB SOON. THERE'S BEEN REFERENCE OF TWO IMPORTANT THINGS SUCH AS CHINA AND RUSSIA DEVELOPING NEW WEAPONS SYSTEMS. THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NUCLEAR TRIED A AND THE IMPORTANCE. I WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON ONE OF THE THREE LEGS OF THE TRIAD WITH YOU IF I COULD. THE GROUND-BASED STRATEGIC DETERRENCE HAS BEEN THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL, I GUESS OF THE THREE. ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY. THERE'S BEEN SOME ABOUT ITS FUTURE. OF COURSE, THREE MISSILES THE NEW SYSTEM WOULD REPLACE ARE THOUGHT TO BE PROBABLY TIMING OUT SOMETIME IN THE 2030 RANGE. SOME OF THE CONTROVERSY THAT I REFER TO HAS TO DO WITH SOME THINKING THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD HOLD BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THE GBSD, RECONSIDER, RE-EVALUATE THE DECISION BY THE AIR FORCE HAS BEEN TO MOVE FORWARD. A GOOD DECISION, I BELIEVE. I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF STICKING TO THAT TIME FRAME OF GETTING OUT THE RFP, MOVING FORWARD WITH THE 600 OR SO NEW MISSILES UNDER , IN THE GBSD AND WHY STICKING WITH THAT TIMEFRAME IS IMPORTANT. WELL, THE TIMEFRAME, I THINK , IT HAS TO DO WITH THE AGING FLEET, IF YOU WILL. NOT ONLY OF THE MISSILES BUT THE BOMBERS AND THE SUBS AS WELL. SO ALL PIECES OF THE NUCLEAR TRIAD DO NEED TO BE MODERNIZED AND OVERHAULED AND UPDATED. THEY'RE REACHING THE END OF THEIR SERVICE LIFE. AND ONE THING THAT IS REALLY CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A RELIABLE, SAFERNUCLEAR STRATEGIC RESPONSE OPTION FOR LEADERS TO CONSIDER. I THINK THE GROUND-BASED STRATEGIC, THE MISSILES, I THINK ARE CRITICAL TO THAT. AND WE NEED TO DO IT AND DO IT IN THE TIME THE AIR FORCE HAS RECOMMENDED. APPRECIATE THAT. I ALSO , THERE'S BEEN REFERENCE TO SPACE. I THINK IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS YOU TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF A SPACE DOMAIN IN RESPONSE TO THAT, THE ADMINISTRATION AS YOU KNOW HAS PROPOSED A SPACE FORCE THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT PASSED BY BOTH THIS COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE INCLUDING THE POSTURE OF A STANDING UP A SPACE FORCE. A COUPLE OUTF THE AREAS I WORKED HARD ON REGARDING THE LEADERSHIP, I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR COMMENTS. I'M SPEAKING TO AFTER ONE YEAR OF THE SPACE FORCE BEING ESTABLISHED, WE HAVE THAT THE COMMANDER WOULD NO LONGER HAVE A DUAL STATUS COMMANDER. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE WOULD BE A SPECIFIC FORCE JUST FOR THE SPACE FORCE. THAT WAS PRETTY WIDELY ACCEPTED. A LITTLE MORE CONTROVERSIAL, AGAIN. THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOUR COMMENTS ON, WOULD BE WE HAVE LANGUAGE THAT AFTER A YEAR, AGAIN, THAT THE COMMANDER WOULD ANSWER DIRECTLY TO THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE RATHER THAN TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND THEN ALSO AFTER A YEAR THAT THE , THAT YOU'D HAVE A PERMANENT MEMBER OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF RATHER THAN A SITUATIONAL MEMBER OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF. TRYING TO MODEL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AFTER THE MARINE\/NAVY RELATIONSHIP. AND WE DID IT IN A WAY TO HAVE SOME INCREMENTAL MOVEMENT, SOME TRANSITION TO AVOID A MAJOR BUREAUCRACY. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN YOUR THOUGHTS AND COMMENTS ON THAT. OBVIOUSLY THE JOB YOU'RE SEEKING WILL HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THAT AND JUST BE INTERESTED IN YOUR OPINIONS. WELL, I WOULD OFFER YOU THIS. FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THE STEPS ARE APPROPRIATE AND RIGHT. AND I THINK THE DUAL HATTING OF GENERAL RAYMOND FOR THE NEXT YEAR IS APPROPRIATE. AND THEN AS WE GO DOWN AND LEARN OUR LESSONS, ET CETERA, AND DEVELOP THAT AND PROTOTYPE IT AND THEN WE CAN SPLIT IT OFF INTO A SPACE FORCE AND SPACE COMMAND. I THINK THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT AND IT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT APPROACH AND I THINK HAVING HIM AS A MEMBER OF THE JOINT CHIEFS I THINK IS ALSO APPROPRIATE. IN ANSWERING TO THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE IS APPROPRIATE. THE BROADER , WE'LL WORK THROUGH THE DETAILS BUT THE BROADER ISSUE IS THE RECOGNITION AND I THINK THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND I APPLAUD THE AIR FORCE FOR DOING IT AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE SUSTAIN IT. THE RECOGNITION OF SPACE AS A DOMAIN OF MILITARY OPERATIONS. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE WISHED IT WOULDN'T BE SO. BUT IT IS. AND , MR. PRESIDENT, CHANCELLOR, THANK YOU FOR HOSTING US AND FOR WELCOMING GENERATIONS, LITERALLY GENERATIONS OF NEW AMERICANS TO A WIDER AND BIGGER AND MORE OPTIMISTIC FUTURE. YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH FOR SO MANY PEOPLE FOR SO LONG, AND IT WAS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU ALL INCLUDING YOU PROPROVOST. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHO DOES A LOT OF THE WORK HERE, BUT THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO USE THAT FORA. POLITICAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT AMERICANS, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DOESN'T VOTE ON FOREIGN POLICY. BUT I THINK THAT'S AN OLD WAY OF THINKING. IN 2019 FOREIGN POLICY IS DOMESTIC POLICY IN MY VIEW. AND DOMESTIC POLICY IS FOREIGN POLICY. THEY'RE DEEPLY CONNECTED. A DEEPLY CONNECTED SET OF CHOICES WE MAKE ABOUT HOW TO ADVANCE THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE AND OUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE. LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ELECTION, THE THREAT THAT I BELIEVE PRESIDENT TRUMP POSES TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND WHERE WE ARE AS A COUNTRY IS EXTREME. AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE IT. HIS ERRATIC POLICIES AND FAILURES TO UPHOLD BASIC DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES HAVE MUDDLED OUR REPULATION AND OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD, AND I QUITE FRANKLY BELIEVE OUR ABILITY TO LEAD THE WORLD. SO LET ME START TODAY BY REMINDING EVERYONE ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN THE , WHAT HAS BEEN LOST WITH THE CHEST THUMPING AND SELF-INFLECTED SETBACKS AND THE MANUFACTURED CRISES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. FOLKS, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY, I THINK, HAS TO BE PURPOSEFUL AND INSPIRING. BASED ON CLEAR GOALS, DRIVEN BY SOUND STRATEGIES. NOT BY TWITTER TANTRUMS. AND THE OVERARCHING PURPOSE OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY, I BELIEVE, MUST BE TO DEFEND AND ADVANCE OUR SECURITY, PROSPERITY, AND DEMOCRATIC VALUES THAT THE UNITED STATES STANDS FOR. EVERY PRESIDENT, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN, IN MODERN HISTORY PRIOR TO DONALD TRUMP HAS UNDERSTOOD AND CARRIED OUT THIS BASIC DIRECTIVE. OFTEN IMPERFECTLY, BUT HAVE , WE'VE NEVER BEFORE HAS IT BEEN SO THOROUGHLY ABANDONEDABANDONED. I KNEW WHEN I SAW DONALD TRUMP RESPOND TO THE EVENTS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, SIGNING A MORAL EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN THOSE WHO PROMOTED HATE AND THOSE WHO OPPOSED IT, THAT THE THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY WAS UNLIKE ANY TIME AT LEAST IN MY LIFETIME. LESS THAN A YEAR LATER TRUMP AGAIN STOOD BEFORE THE PRESS. THIS TIME ON FOREIGN SOIL IN HELSINKI. AND REPEATEDLY DEFERRED TO VLADIMIR PUTIN OVER AMERICAN INTEREST, THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, AND I WOULD ARGUE OVER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S INTEREST. I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SHAMEFUL PERFORMANCES BY A U.S. PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY. AND ONE OF , ONE WHERE WE SAW REPEATED AGAIN THAT LAST MONTH AT THE G-20 SUMMIT WHERE TRUMP SMIRKED ALONG WITH PUTIN MAKING A JOKE OUT OF RUSSIA'S VERY REAL AND VERY DANGEROUS ASSAULT ON OUR ELECTORAL INSTITUTIONS. TRUMP'S VIEW AND MY VIEW, THE BASES ARE CHERISH DEMOCRATIC VALUES. AT THE VERY TIME A SIN CO-FANT TO A STRONG MAN HE REFUSES THAT ROLE. REFUSES TO CONDEMN SAUDI ARABIA FOR THE GRUESOME MURDER OF A JOURNALIST AND AMERICAN RESIDENT, AND WHEN HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH A MURDEROUS DICTATOR IN NORTH KOREA. I KNOW IT'S NOT LITERAL, BUT THINK WHAT MESSAGE IT SOUNDS AROUND , SENDS AROUND THE WORLD. HE UNDERMINES OUR DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCES WHILE EMBRACING DICTATORS WHO APPEAL TO HIS VANITY. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, THE WORLD SEES TRUMP FOR WHAT HE IS. INSINCERE, ILL INFORMED AND IMPULSIVE AND AT TIMES CORRUPT. IT'S WHY WE'VE SEEN SUCH A DROP IN HOW THE REST OF THE WORLD VIEWS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ONE RECENT POLL FOUND AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IS NOW LESS RESPECTED THAN CHINA'S AND ON PAR WITH RUSSIA'S. AND IF WE GIVE DONALD TRUMP FOUR MORE YEARS, WE'LL HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFICULTY OF EVER BEING ABLE TO RECOVER AMERICA'S STANDING IN THE WORLD IN OUR CAPACITY TO BRING NATIONS TOGETHER. IT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED. I THINK IT WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND TO OUR FUTURE. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I WOULD REMIND THE WORLD THAT WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND WE DO NOT CODDLE DICTATORS. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA GIVES HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. THERE WILL BE NO MORE CHARLOTTESVILLES. NO MORE HELSINKIS. THE CHALLENGE OF FOLLOWING THIS DISASTROUS PRESIDENCY WILL NOT BE JUST TO RESTORE THE REPUTATION OF OUR CREDIBILITY. IT WILL BE TO ENACT A FORWARD-LOOKING FOREIGN POLICY FOR THE WORLD AS WE FIND IT TODAY. AND AS WE ANTICIPATE IT WILL BE TOMORROW AND YEARS TO COME. MUCH HAS SHIFTED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. THE INTERNATIONAL LANDSCAPE IS MORE CROWDED, COMPETITIVE, AND COMPLICATED. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT'S DIFFERENT TODAY TWO KEY POINTS JUMP OUT TO ME. ONE IS THAT THE SPEED AND INTENSITY OF THE GRAVEST DANGERS MEANS THAT THE FATES OF NATIONS ARE MORE INTERTWINED THAN THEY EVER HAVE BEEN. CLIMATE CHANGE. NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION. INTERNATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM. FIBER WAR , CYBER WARFARE. MASS MIGRATION. WE'RE MOVING LIKE MOORE'S LAW IS MOVING. NONE OF THEM CAN BE RESOLVED BY THE UNITED STATES ALONE OR ANY NATION ACTING ALONE. AMERICAN SECURITY, PROSPERITY, AND OUR WAY OF LIFE REQUIRES THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE NETWORK OF PARTNERS AND ALLIANCES WORKING ALONGSIDE ONE ANOTHER. DONALD TRUMP'S BRAND OF AMERICA FIRST HAS TOO OFTEN LED TO AMERICA ALONE. MAKING IT MUCH HARDER TO MOBILIZE OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE THREATS TO OUR COMMON WELL BEING. THE SECOND CONCERN IS THE RAPID ADVANCE OF AUTHORITARIANISM, NATIONALISM AND ILL LIBERAL TEN TEN DIS AROUND THE WORLD. NOT JUST IN RUSSIA AND CHINA BUT ALSO FROM OUR ALLIES. PLACES LIKE TURKEY, THE PHILIPPINES, HUNGARY, AND EVERY PART OF THE WORLD TECHNOLOGY AND INSTANT INFORMATION ARE DRIVING CHANGE AT UNPRECEDENTED SPEED AND SCOPE, CAUSING MANY PEOPLE HOME AND ABROAD TO FEEL CONFUSED AND VERY VULNERABLE. DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS PARALYZED BY HYPER PARTISANSHIP. HOBBLED BY CONSTRUCTION ARE HAVING A HARDER TIME DELIVERING TO THEIR PEOPLE. TRUST AND INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD IS DOWN AND FEAR OF THE OTHER IS WAY UP. TOGETHER IN MY VIEW THESE FORCES HAVE DRIVEN DANGEROUS RESURGENCE OF EXTREME NATIONALISM AND LIBERALISM, OF PROTECTIONISM AND XENOPHOBIA. AND DONALD TRUMP AND THE DEMAGOGUES AROUND THE WORLD ARE LEANING INTO THESE FORCES FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL AND POLITICAL GAIN. BUT IN MY VIEW, IF WE FOCUS, THIS IS NOT A MOMENT TO FEAR. IT'S A TIME FOR US TO TAP INTO THE STRENGTH AND AUDACITY THAT TOOK US TO VICTORY IN TWO WORLD WARS AND BROUGHT DOWN THE IRON CURTAIN. THAT TRIUMPH OF DEMOCRACY AND LIBERALISM OVER FASCISM AND AWE TO BE AUTOCRACY IS WHAT CREATED THE FREE WORLD. IT WILL DEFINE OUR FUTURE. TODAY DEMOCRACY IS UNDER DEPENDENCE PRESSURE MORE THAN ANY TIME SINCE THE 30s. FREEDOM HOUSE REPORTED THAT OF THE 41 COUNTRIES CONSISTENTLY RANKED AS FREE FROM 1985 TO 2005, 22 HAVE REGISTERED NET DECLINES IN FREEDOM IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. YET WHILE THE WORLD'S DEMOCRACIES LOOK TO AMERICA TO STAND FOR THE VALUES THAT UNITE US AND TRULY LEAD THE FREE WORLD, DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO BE ON THE OTHER TEAM. WHILE THOSE LIVING UNDER OPPRESSION, YEARNING FOR FREEDOM LOOK TO THE UNITED STATES FOR HOPE, TRUMP HAS NOTHING REALLY TO OFFER. WE CAN'T FORGET THE DEMOCRACY IS THE ROAD OUR SOCIETY, THE ROOT AND WELLSPRING OF OUR POWER, AND THE SOURCE OF OUR RENEWAL. IT STRENGTHENS AND AMPLIFIES OUR LEADERSHIP TO KEEP US SAFE IN THE WORLD AND IT'S THE ENGINE OF OUR INJI KNEWTY THAT HAS DRIVEN ALL OUR ECONOMIC PROCESS AND PROGRESS. YOU KNOW, IT'S THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE. AND HOW WE SEE THE WORLD, BUT MAYBE EQUALLY IMPORTANT, HOW THE WORLD SEES US. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL ENSURE THE DEMOCRACY IS ONCE AGAIN THE WATCH WORD OF U.S. FOREIGN POLICY. NOT TO LAUNCH SOME MORAL CRUSADE BUT BECAUSE IT'S IN OUR ENLIGHTENED SELF-INTEREST. WE HAVE TO RESTORE OUR ABILITY TO RALLY THE FREE WORLD SO WE CAN ONCE MORE MAKE A STAND UPON NEW FIELDS OF ACTION TOGETHER TO FACE NEW CHALLENGES. WE ONLY HAVE ONE OPPORTUNITY TO RESET THIS DEMOCRACY AFTER TRUMP. AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT. SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN PRACTICE? FIRST, IT MEANS REPAIRING AND REINVIGORATING OUR OWN DEMOCRACY. EVEN AS WE STRENGTHEN COALITIONS TO DEMOCRACIES THAT STAND WITH US ON OTHER CONTINENT. I'LL START BY PUTTING OUR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER. REMAKING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM SO THE CHILD'S OPPORTUNITY LIFE ISN'T DETERMINED BY THEIR ZIP CODE OR THEIR RACE. REFORMING OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ELIMINATES DISCREPANCIES IN THE SYSTEM AND PUTTING TEETH BACK INTO OUR VOTING RIGHTS ACT. I WILL SEEK GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN OUR CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEMS. WE NEED TO GET BIG MONEY OUT ALTOGETHER AND ENSURE THAT FOREIGN DARK MONEY DOESN'T CONTINUE TO POLLUTE OUR POLITICS. WE NEED IN MY VIEW TO DEDICATE GREATER RESOURCES INCLUDING CYBER RESOURCES TO DEFENDING OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM WHICH IS STILL UNDER SIEGE. I SERVED AS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE TRANSATLANTIC COMMISSION ON ELECTION INTEGRITY TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST RUSSIA'S ATTACKS ON WESTERN DEMOCRACIES. WE ASKED CANDIDATES ACROSS EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA TO SIGN A PLEDGE COMMITTING TO TRANSPARENCY IN CAMPAIGN FINANCES AND TO REJECT THE USE OF FABRICATED AND HACKED MATERIAL. NOW THAT I'M A CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE, I'VE SIGNED THAT PLEDGE MYSELF. AND I URGE EVERYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO SIGN THAT SAME PLEDGE. IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A NATION, WE HAVE TO PROVE TO THE WORLD THE UNITED STATES IS PREPARED TO LEAD, NOT JUST BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER BUT BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. TO THAT END, AS PRESIDENT, I WILL TAKE DECISIVE STEPS TO RENEW OUR AMERICAN VALUES BY RETURNING TRANSPARENCY TO OUR GOVERNMENT. WE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM OF RELIGION. THOOS THAT'S WHY I'LL END THE MUSLIM BAN. WE BELIEVE IN FREE SPEECH. THAT'S WHY I WILL END THE GAG RULE, THE GLOBAL GAG RULE THAT PREVENTS MONEY FROM GETTING NGOs WHO'VEN TALK ABOUT FAMILY PLANNING. WE BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF FREE PRESS. THAT'S WHY I'LL RETURN IMMEDIATELY TODAYLY PRESS BRIEFINGS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT. WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK THOSE WORDS, THOSE LITERAL WORDS, NATION OF IMMIGRANTS OUT OF THE STATEMENT, THE MISSION STATEMENT OF OUR CITIZEN AND IMMIGRATIONS SERVICES. I'LL RESTORE THE WORDS. IT MATTERS. OUR STATUE OF LIBERTY SAYS INVITES US AND WELCOME THE TIRED, THE POOR, THE HUDDLED MASSES, YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE. I'LL REVERSE TRUMP'S DETRIMENT TALL ASYLUM POLICIES, RAISE OUR TARGET FOR REFUGEES TO A LEVEL COMMENSURATE WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND THE UNPRECEDENTED GLOBAL NEED THAT EXISTS. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WOULD IMMEDIATELY END THE HORRIFIC PRACTICE OF SEPARATING FAMILIES AT OUR BORDERS, HOLDING CHILDREN FOR PROFIT DETENTIONS. THERE'S NO NEED FOR US TO DO THAT AND STILL PROTECT OUR BORDERS. I'D ORDER A REVIEW OF THE TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE STATUS TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHO CANNOT FULLY BELIEVE AND FIND THE SAFETY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRIES. RIPPED APART BY VIOLENCE AND DISASTERS INCLUDING VENEZUELANS AND HAITIANS. WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN A NATION THAT CHOOSES SCIENCE OVER FICTION. AND FROM CLIMATE CHANGE TO STANDARDS TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS TO GLOBAL HEALTH POLICY, WE'RE GOING TO RETURN FACTS TO OUR POLICY MAKING. I'LL RENEW A GOVERNMENT WIDE FOCUS ON UPLIFTING THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS AT HOME AND ABROAD AND REVIETTALIZE OUR COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD. THESE CHANGES AND MANY MORE WHICH I RELEASED ON OUR WEBSITE ARE JUST THE START, A DAY ONE DOWN PAYMENT ON OUR COMMITMENT TO LIVING OUR DEMOCRATIC VALUES AT HOME. AND THEN I WILL INVITE FELLOW DEMOCRATIC LEADERS AND I MEAN THIS. INVITE FELLOW DEMOCRATIC LEADERS TO PUT STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY BACK IN THE GLOBAL STAGE. I WILL ORGANIZE AND HOST IN THE UNITED STATES DURING MY FIRST YEAR IN ADMINISTRATION WERE I TO BE ELECTED A GLOBAL SUMMIT FOR DEMOCRACY. RENEWAL OF THE SPIRIT AND SHARED PURPOSE OF THE NATION'S OF THE FREE WORLD. BUILDING OFF THE SUCCESSFUL MODEL WE INSTITUTED DURING THE OBAMA\/BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WITH THE NUCLEAR SAFETY SUMMIT. LEADERS WHO ATTEND MUST COME PREPARED TO COOPERATE AND MAKE CONCRETE COMMITMENTS TO TAKE ON CORRUPTION AND ADVANCE HUMAN RIGHTS IN THEIR OWN NATIONS. WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT , EXCUSE ME. WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT OUR FRIENDS THAT ARE FALLING SHORT AND FORGE A COMMON AGENDA TO ADDRESS THE GREATEST THREATS TO OUR SHARED VALUES. WE'LL INCLUDE CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS FROM AROUND THE WORLD THAT STAND ON THE FRONT LINES IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY IN THEIR COUNTRIES. WE'LL CHALLENGE THE PRIVATE SECTOR INCLUDING THE TECH COMPANIES AND SOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS TO MAKE THEIR OWN COMMITMENTS. AMERICA'S OPENNESS FUEL THEIR SUCCESS. I BELIEVE THEY HAVE A DUTY TO MAKE SURE THEIR ALGORITHM AND PLATFORMS ARE NOT MISUSED TO SEW DIVISION HERE AT HOME OR EMPOWER THEIR SURVEILLANCE STATES TO BE ABLE TO FACILITY THEIR OPPRESSION AND SENSORSHIP IN CHINA OR ELSEWHERE. TO SPREAD HATE OR TO SPUR PEOPLE TO VIOLENCE. SECONDLY, I WILL EQUIP OUR PEOPLE TO SUCCEED IN THE NEW GLOBAL ECONOMY WITH A FOREIGN POLICY FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. TO TWIN THE COMPETITION OF THE FUTURE, WE HAVE TO DOUBLE DOWN ON SHARPENING OUR INNOVATIVE EDGE, UNITING ECONOMIC MIGHT OF OUR FRIENDS AND OTHER ABUSIVE PRACTICES TO TAKE THEM ON. WE KNOW THAT ECONOMIC SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO ARE HURTING BECAUSE WE'VE NEGLECTED THE BASICS. OUR TRADE POLICY HAS A START AT HOME BY STRENGTHENING BY STRENGTHENING OUR GREATEST ASSET, THE MIDDLE CLASS. FOR WHEN IT DOES WELL, EVERYONE DOES WELL. WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING I'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL BY GIVING EVERY STUDENT THE SKILL AND TRAINING THEY NEED TO COMPETE IN THE 21st CENTURY FOR THE JOBS OF THE 21st CENTURY. AMERICA HAS ACCESS TO QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO INVIGORATE THAT CLASS. INVESTING AND REBUILDING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, BRIDGES, ROADS, MODERNIZING AIRPORTS, HIGH SPEED RAIL, MAKING SURE AMERICANS HAVE ACCESS TO BROAD BAND NETWORKS. REFORMING OUR TAXES TO REWARD WORK NOT JUST WEALTH. LISTENING AND LEADING ON A CLEAN ECONOMY REVOLUTION TO CREATE 10 MILLION NEW JOBS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT PAY WELL ALLOWING US EVENTUALLY TO EXPORT THOSE TECHNOLOGIES OVERSEAS. I'LL INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, THE CORNER STONE OF MY PRESIDENCY WILL BE JUST THAT SO THE UNITED STATES IS THE LEADING , LEADING THE CHARGE FOR INNOVATION AROUND THE WORLD. THERE'S NO REASON WE SHOULD BE FAILING OR FALLING BEHIND ANYONE. CHINA OR ANYWHERE ELSE, WHEN IT COMES TO ENERGY, QUANTUM COMPUTING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, 5G, HIGH SPEED RAIL. FOLKS, WE HAVE THE GREATEST RESEARCH FACILITIES. MORE THAN ANYWHERE IN THE REST OF THE WORD COMBINED. WE CANNOT ENSURE OUR PEOPLE ARE READY FOR THIS TRANSITION? THAT IT WILL ACCOMPANY ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY, IT WOULD BE A DISASTER. WE NEED THE MOST AGILE SYSTEM TO ACCOMMODATE THESE CHANGES. FOLKS, WE'RE VIRTUALLY ENERGY INDEPENDENT. WE HAVE A STRONG TRADITION OF THE RULE OF LAW. I SEE JACK. THAT'S WHY THE REST OF THE WORLD INVESTS HERE, JACK, AS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO. THEY KNOW THEY'RE SAFE. AND MOST IMPORTANT, WE HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY POPULATION OF WORKERS AND INNOVATORS WHO HAVE NEVER LET OUR COUNTRY DOWN WHEN GIVEN HALF A CHANCE. A FOREIGN POLICY OF THE MIDDLE CLASS WILL ALSO WORK TO MAKE SURE THE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY ARE NOT RIGGED AGAINST US. BECAUSE WHEN AMERICAN BUSINESS COMPETE ON A FAIR PLAYING FIELD, WE WIN. PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY THINK HIS BEING TOUGH ON CHINA ALL THAT HE HAS DELIVERED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS AMERICAN FARMERS, MANUFACTURERS AND CONSUMERS LOSING AND PAYING MORE. HIS ECONOMIC DECISION MAKING IS SO SHORTSIGHTED AND AS SHORTSIGHTED AS THE REST OF HIS FOREIGN POLICY. CHINA IS PLAYING THE LONG-GAME, EXTENDING ITS GLOBAL REACH, INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGIES OF THE FUTURE. WHEN TRUMP IS DEZING NATING OUR OLD , DEZINGSIGNATEING OUR OLDEST ALLIES AS NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS IN ORDER TO IMPOSE DAMAGING AND POINTLESS TARIFFS. BY CUTTING US OFF FROM THE ECONOMIC CLOUT OF OUR PARTNERS HE KNEECAPS OUR CAPACITY TO TAKE ON REAL ECONOMIC THREATS. WE NEED TO GET TOUGH WITH CHINA. IF CHINA HAS ITS WAY, IT'S GOING TO KEEP MOVING AND ROBBING U.S. FIRMS OF OUR TECHNOLOGY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES AND FORCING COMPANIES TO GIVE IT AWAY TO DO BUSINESS IN CHINA. THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY WE NEED TO CHANGE IS TO BUILD A UNITED FRONT OF FRIENDS AND PARTNERS TO CHALLENGE CHINA'S ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR. EVEN AS WE SEEK TO DEEPEN COOPERATION ON ISSUES WHERE OUR INTERESTS ARE CONVERGED LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AND PREVENTING A NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A BACK TO BUSINESS AS USUAL ON TRADE WITH ME. WE NEED NEW RULES. WE NEED NEW PROCESSES. THAT HAS THE VOICES OF ALL THE SHAREHOLDERS AT THE TABLE INCLUDING LEADERS REPRESENTING LABOR AND THE ENVIRONMENT. WE MUST NEGOTIATE FROM THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE POSITION. ON OUR OWN, WE REPRESENT A QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S GDP. BUT WHEN WE'RE JOINED BY FELLOW DEMOCRACIES, THAT NUMBER DOUBLES. CHINA CAN'T AFFORD TO IGNORE HALF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IF WE'RE UNITED. THAT GIVES US SUBSTANTIAL LEVERAGE TO SHAPE THE FUTURE RULES OF THE ROAD ON EVERYTHING FROM THE ENVIRONMENT TO LABOR TO TRADE TO TECHNOLOGY TO TRANSPARENCY. SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO REFLECT THE DEMOCRATIC INTEREST AND VALUES. AMERICA'S INTEREST AND VALUES. NOT CHINA. NOT RUSSIA'S. THE WORLD IS NOT ORGANIZED ITSELF. AND IF WE DO NOT SHAPE THE NORMS AND INSTITUTIONS THAT GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AMONG NATIONS, REST ASSURED THAT SOME NATION WILL STEP INTO THE VACUUM, OR NO ONE WILL, AND CHAOS WILL PREVAIL. WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY FINAL POINT. THE BIDEN FOREIGN POLICY AGENDA WILL PLACE AMERICA BACK AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE WORKING WITH OUR ALLIES AND OUR PARTNERS TO MOBILIZE GLOBAL ACTION ON GLOBAL THREATS, ESPECIALLY THOSE UNIQUE TO OUR COUNTRY. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS NOT INFALLIBLE. WE'VE MADE MISSTEPS AND MISTAKES TO INSTEAD OF DRAWING ON THE FULL ARRAY OF OUR STRENGTHS. LET ME BE CLEAR. I WILL NEVER HESITATE TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE INCLUDING WHEN NECESSARY BY THE USE OF FORCE. AS VICE PRESIDENT I WORK WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA TO CRAFT THE MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC CAMPAIGN THAT ULTIMATELY DEFEATED ISIS. IN FACT, IT TURNED OUT TRUMP'S SECRET WEAPON TO DESTROY THE SO-CALLED CALIPHATE WAS A CONTINUATION OF THE PLAN WE PUT IN PLACE WITH PERSONNEL THAT WE HAD PUT IN PLACE. WE HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD. AND I WOULD ARGUE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. BUT AS PRESIDENT, I WILL ENSURE IT STAYS THAT WAY. I WILL MAKE INVESTMENTS NECESSARY TO EQUIP OUR TROOPS FOR THE CHALLENGES OF THIS CENTURY, NOT THE LAST CENTURY, THIS ONE AND THE NEXT ONE. BUT THE USE OF FORCE SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT, NOT A FIRST. USED ONLY TO DEFEND OUR VITAL INTEREST WHEN THE OBJECTIVE IS CLEAR AND ACHIEVABLE AND WITH THE INFORMED, I EMPHASIZE THE INFORMED CONSENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT'S LONG PAST TIME WE END THE FOREVER WARS WHICH HAVE COST US UNTOLD BLOOD AND TREASURE. I HAVE LONG-ARGUED THAT WE SHOULD BRING HOME THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR COMBAT TROOPS FROM THE WARS IN AFGHANISTAN AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND NARROWLY FOCUS ON OUR MISSION TO DEAL WITH AL-QAEDA AND ISIS IN THE REGION. AND WE SHOULD END OUR SUPPORT FOR THE SAUDI-LED WAR IN YEMEN. IT'S HURTING US. STAYING ENTRENCHED IN UNWINNABLE CONFLICTS DRAINS OUR CAPACITY TO LEAD IN OTHER ISSUES THAT REQUIRE OUR ATTENTION. IT PREVENTS US FROM REBUILDING THE OTHER INSTANCES OF AMERICAN POWER. I'LL MAKE IT MY MISSION TO RESTORE AMERICAN LEADERSHIP, E ELEVATE DIPLOMACY AS A PRINCIPLE TOOL OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY. I WILL REINVEST IN A DIPLOMATIC CORE THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS HALLOWED OUT AND PUT OUR DIPLOMACY BACK IN THE HANDS OF GENUINE PROFESSIONALS. SO YOU DON'T HEAR AN ECHO ON THE 7th FLOOR OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT ANY LONGER. ABOVE ALL, I SEE SOME DIPLOMATS HERE WHEN OUR ADMINISTRATION AND OTHERS, ABOVE ALL DIPLOMACY REQUIRES CREDIBILITY AND DONALD TRUMP HAS CORRODED OUR COUNTRY'S CREDIBILITY. YOU KNOW, IN THE CONDUCT OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AND ESPECIALLY TIMES OF CRISIS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WORD, HIS OR HER WORD IS THE SINGLE MOST VALUABLE ASSET THE COUNTRY HAS. BY PULLING OUT OF TREATY AFTER TREATY, RENIGING ON POLICY AFTER POLICY, WALKING AWAY FROM AMERICA'S RESPONSIBILITIES, AND LYING ABOUT MATTERS BIG AND SMALL, THIS PRESIDENT HAS BANKRUPTED AMERICA'S WORD IN THE WORLD AT THE MOMENT. HE HAS , I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY IT. HE'S ALIENATED US FROM THE VERY DEMOCRATIC ALLIES WE NEED MOST. TRUMP HAS TAKEN A BATTERING RAM TO THE NATO ALLIANCE. HE TREATS IT LIKE IT'S AN AMERICAN-RUN PROTECTION RACKET. HE JUST DOESN'T GET IT. I REALLY DON'T THINK HE GETS IT. NATO IS AT ITS HEART, THE VERY HEART OF NATO. AND OUR NATIONAL SECURITY MORE THAN THAT, IT IS A , AN ALLIANCE OF VALUES. IT'S AN ALLIANCE OF VALUES. IT MAKES IT FAR MORE DURABLE, RELIABLE, AND POWERFUL THAN PARTNERSHIPS BUILT ON COERCION AND ON CASH. THE SAME IS TRUE OF OUR CORE ALLIANCES IN ASIA. LET ME BE CLEAR. WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH OTHER NATIONS TO SHARE OUR VALUES AND GOALS DOESN'T MAKE AMERICA AS IT SEEMS TO IMPLY IN THIS ADMINISTRATION, SUCKERS. IT MAKES US MORE SECURE. ENABLES US TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL. WE AMPLIFY OUR OWN STRENGTHS, EXTEND OUR PRESENCE AROUND THE GLOBE, MAGNIFY OUR IMPACT WHILE SHARING THE BURDEN OF LEADERSHIP WITH OUR PARTNERS. NO COUNTRY, EVEN ONE AS POWERFUL AS OURS, CAN GO ALONE IN THE CHALLENGE OF THE 21st CENTURY. I RESPECT NO BORDERS AND CANNOT BE CONTAINED BY ANY WALLS. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL DO MORE THAN JUST RESTORE THE HISTORIC PARTNERSHIPS. I'LL LEAD AN EFFORT TO REIMAGINE THEM, TO BETTER MEET THE CHALLENGES WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH TODAY IN THE NEXT 20 OR 30 YEARS TO KEEP NATO MILITARY CAPABILITY SHARP WHILE ALSO EXPANDING OUR CAPACITY TO TAKE ON NONTRADITIONAL THREATS LIKE WEAPONIZED CORRUPTION, CYBER THEFT, NEW CHALLENGES IN SPACE AND ON THE HIGH SEAS. AND BY THE WAY, THE INCREASE IN NATO DEFENSE SPENDING I WOULD POINT OUT STARTED UNDER THE OBAMA\/BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. WE NEED TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR STRENGTH AND DOMESTIC COOPERATION WITH FRIENDS BEYOND NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. REACHING TO OUR PARTNERS IN ASIA INCLUDING JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, AUSTRALIA, INDIA, TO FORTIFY OUR COLLECTIVE CAPABILITIES. SUSTAINING, SUSTAINING OUR IRONCLAD COMMITMENTS TO ISRAEL SECURITY REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH YOU MAY DISAGREE WITH THIS PRESENT LEADER, IT IS ESSENTIAL. INTEGRATEING OUR FRIENDS IN LATIN AMERICA AND AFRICA AND SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE BROADER NETWORK OF DEMOCRACIES, IN ORDER TO GAIN AND REGAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE WORLD, WE NEED , WE HAVE TO PROVE AGAIN THAT AMERICA SAYS WHAT IT MEANS AND MEANS WHAT IT SAYS. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHALLENGES THAT WILL DEFINE OUR TIME. RENEWAL THREAT, RENEWED THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR. MASS MIGRATION. DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES. CLIMATE CHANGE. WE CANNOT BE A CREDIBLE VOICE ON THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR SECURITY, ON PROLIFERATION AND NUCLEAR SECURITY WHILE WE'RE ABANDONING THE VERY DEALS THAT WE HAD NEGOTIATED. FROM NORTH KOREA TO IRAN, RUSSIA TO SAUDI ARABIA, TRUMP HAS MADE THE PROSPECT OF NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION A NEW NUCLEAR ARMS RACE, AND EVEN THE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS MORE LIKELY, NOT LESS. I'VE WORKED ON THESE ISSUES MY ENTIRE CAREER. I UNDERSTAND WHAT'S AT STAKE, AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES FAILING TO ACT. THAT'S WHY AS PRESIDENT, I'D RENEW OUR COMMITMENT TO ARMS CONTROL FOR A NEW ERA. THE HISTORIC IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL WE NEGOTIATED BLOCKED IRAN FROM GAINING NUCLEAR WEAPONS WITH INSPECTORS ON THE GROUND, INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS CONFIRMING THAT THE AGREEMENT WAS BEING KEPT. YOU HAVE TRUMP CASTED ASIDE, PROMPTING IRAN TO RESTART ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND BECOME MORE PROVOCATIVE AND RAISING THE RISK OF ANOTHER DISASTROUS WAR IN THE REGION. IF TEHRAN RETURNS TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE DEAL, I WOULD REJOIN THE AGREEMENT AND WORK WITH OUR ALLIES TO STRENGTHEN AND EXTEND IT WHILE MORE EFFECTIVELY PUSHING BACK AGAINST IRAN TO DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES WHICH WE ARE ALLOWED TO DO AND WE HAD PARTNERS TO DO WITH US. NORTH KOREA, I WILL EMPOWER OUR NEGOTIATORS TO JUMP START A SUSTAINED COORDINATED CAMPAIGN WITH OUR ALLIES AND OTHERS INCLUDING CHINA TO ADVANCE OUR SHARED OBJECTIVE. IT IS A SHARED OBJECTIVE. A DENUCLEARIZED NORTH KOREA. I'LL PURSUE AN EXTENSION OF THE NEW STAR TREATY, AN ANCHOR OF STRATEGIC STABILITY BEFORE THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA AND USE IT AS A FOUNDATION FOR NEW ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS. I WOULD TAKE OTHER STEPS AS WELL TO DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO REDUCING THE ROLE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. AS I SAID IN 2017, I BELIEVE THE SOLE PURPOSE OF U.S. NUCLEAR ARSENAL SHOULD BE DETERRING AND IF NECESSARY, RETALIATE AGAINST A NUCLEAR ATTACK. AS PRESIDENT, I'LL WORK TO PUT THAT BELIEF INTO PRACTICE AFTER CONSULTATION WITH OUR ALLIES AND OUR MILITARY. BY THE SAME MEASURE, WE CANNOT PUSH NATIONS TO MEET THEIR HUMANITARIAN OBLIGATIONS TO ADDRESS THE BIGGEST REFUGEE MIGRATION CRISIS SINCE WORLD WAR II IF WE'RE UNWILLING TO LIVE UP TO OUR DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND FIRMLY REJECT TRUMP'S NATIVIST RHETORIC. IT STANDS OUT THAT WE, IT STANDS, OUR NATION, ON OUR FATHERS, WHEN YOU SAW A FATHER AND A DAUGHTER'S BODY ON A SHORE DEAD, WHEN CHILDREN ARE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS, STUCK IN OVERCROWDED DETENTION FACILITIES, DENIED THE MOST BASIC NECESSITIES. WHEN FAMILIES ARE RIPPED APART, ABANDONING OUR DEEPESTLY HELD VALUES, IT DOES NOTHING. IT DOES NOTHING TO INCREASE OUR SECURITY AT THE BORDER AND EVERYTHING TO DIMINISH OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD AND THE ABILITY TO LEAD BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. WE NEED SENSIBLE POLICIES TO IMPROVE SCREENING PRIORITIES AT THE LEGAL POINTS OF ENTRY TO MAKE SMART INVESTMENTS IN BORDER TECHNOLOGY. WE NEED TO WORK AGAIN WITH CANADA AND MEXICO AS NEIGHBORS, NOT AS ADVERSARIES AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE ROOT CAUSES DRIVING MIGRANTS TO OUR BORDERS IN THE FIRST PLACE. AS VICE PRESIDENT, I SECURED COMMITMENTS FROM LEADERS OF GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS AFTER MULTIPLE MEETINGS TO TAKE ON CORRUPTION, VIOLENCE, AND THE ENDEMIC POVERTY IN THOSE COUNTRIES THAT ARE THE DRIVING FORCE OF SENDING PEOPLE AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES AND TO OUR BORDERS. AND THEN I WORKED WITH CONGRESS IN A BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO GET AID PACKAGES TO HELP SUPPORT THOSE REFORMS. AND GUESS WHAT. IT WAS WORKING. SECURITY IMPROVED. MIGRANT FLOWS BEGAN TO DECREASE IN COUNTRIES LIKE EL SALVADOR. BUT TRUMP ANNOUNCED THE END OF OUR AID TO CENTRAL AMERICA VIA A TWEET WITH NO UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSEQUENCES. IF ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL RELAUNCH THAT INITIATIVE WITH THE TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW OF OUR FUNDING TO THE REGION, DETERMINE HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO DRIVE REFORMS THAT DELIVER RESULTS, AND THEY WILL DELIVER RESULTS. WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE FUTURE, LIKE 5G, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, OTHER NATIONS ARE DEVOTING NATIONAL RESOURCES AND DOMINATING THEIR DEVELOPMENT. DETERMINING HOW THEY WILL BE USED. WE HAVE TO ENSURE THE 21st CENTURY TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED TO PROMOTE GREATER DEMOCRACY, SHARED PROSPERITY, NOT TO CURB FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY NOT AT HOME OR ABROAD. AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES SHAPE OUR ECONOMIES AND SOCIETIES, WE HAVE ENSURE THAT THESE ENGINES OF PROGRESS ARE BOUND BY LAWS AND ETHICS. WE HAVE DONE IT AT EVERY TECHNOLOGICAL TURNING POINT IN OUR HISTORY. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WOULD JOIN TOGETHER WITH OUR DEMOCRATIC ALLIES TO DEVELOP SECURE PRIVATE SECTOR LED 5G NETWORKS LEAVING NO COMMUNITY, RURAL OR LOW INCOME BEHIND. AND THE LAST EXAMPLE I'LL END WITH TODAY IS HOW THE UNITED STATES MUST LEAD THE WORLD TO TAKE ON THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT WE ALL FACE. CLIMATE CHANGE. IF WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT, NOT MUCH ELSE WILL MATTER. I'LL PUT US ON A TRACK TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050. AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES MAKES UP ONLY 15% OF GLOBAL EMISSIONS. I'LL LEVERAGE OUR ECONOMIC AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY TO PUT THE WORLD ON A MORE URGENT COURSE BY REJOINING THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD AND CONVENE A SUMMON OF THE WORLD , THAT ACCORD IS NEGOTIATED SAID WE HAVE TO UP THE ANTE, CONVENING THE BIGGEST CARBON EMITTERS RELYING ON NATIONS TO RAISE THEIR AMBITIONS AND PUSH PROGRESS FURTHER AND FASTER. WE'LL LOOK FOR ENFORCEABLE COMMITMENTS THAT WILL PRODUCE EMISSIONS, REDUCE EMISSIONS, AND GLOBAL SHIPPING AND AVIATION. WE'LL PURSUE STRONG MEASURES TO MAKE SURE OTHER NATIONS CAN'T UNDERCUT US ECONOMICALLY AS WE MEET OUR COMMITMENTS. THAT INCLUDES ASSISTING THE CHINA, THE WORLD'S LARGEST EMITTER OF CARBON STOPS SUBSIDIZING COAL EXPORTS, OUTSOURCING POLLUTION TO OTHER COUNTRIES BY EXPORTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DIRTY COAL , THESE ARE AMBITION GOALS, I ACKNOWLEDGE. AND I WON'T ACCOMPLISH ANY OF THEM WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES FLANKED BY OUR FELLOW DEMOCRACIES LEADING THE WAY. WE'RE FACING ENEMIES BOTH WITHOUT AND FROM WITHIN. HOPING TO EXPLOIT THE FISSURES IN OUR SOCIETY, UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY, BREAK UP OUR ALLIANCES, RETURN US TO AN INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM THAT MIGHT. THE ANSWER TO THIS THREAT IS MORE OPENNESS. NOT LESS. MORE FRIENDSHIPS, MORE COOPERATIONS, MORE ALLIANCES, MORE DEMOCRACIES. VLADIMIR PUTIN WANTS TO TELL HIMSELF AND ANYONE WHO HE CAN DUPE INTO BELIEVING THAT THE LIBERAL IDEA, THAT LIBERAL IDEA IS OBSOLETE BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS ITS POWER. NO ARMY ON EARTH CAN MATCH THE ELECTRIC IDEA OF LIBERTY. PASSING FREELY FROM PERSON TO PERSON, IT JUMPS BORDERS. IT TRANSCENDS LANGUAGES AND CULTURES. AND IT CAN SUPERCHARGE COMMUNITIES OF ORDINARY CITIZENS INTO ACTIVISTS AND ORGANIZE FOR CHANGE AGENTS. WE MUST ONCE MORE HARNESS THAT POWER AND RALLY THE FREE WORLD TO MEET THE CHALLENGES FACING US TODAY. AND IT FALLS TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO LEAD THE WAY. NO OTHER NATION HAS THE CAPACITY TO DO IT. NO OTHER NATION WAS BUILT ON THAT IDEAL, THAT PROMISE ALONE. AND IT'S OVERWHELMING IN OUR SELF-INTEREST. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CHAMPION LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE TO REMAIN OUR CREDIBILITY AND LOOK WITH UNRELENTING OPTIMISM AND THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE CAN DO THIS. LET'S REMEMBER WHO IN GOD'S NAME WE ARE. NOT HAVE , THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NOT A DAMN THING WE'VE BEEN UNABLE TO DO WHEN WE'VE DONE IT TOGETHER.

THIS IS ABOUT 30 MINUTES. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, MOLLY. THANK YOU. IN THANK YOU NEW HAMPSHIRE YOUNG DEMOCRATS. MY NAME IS DANNY. I'M A YOUNG DEMOCRAT, THEY WERE PRESENTED OF FROM THE NORTH COUNTRY, AND I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN , [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] [CHANTING \"GO JOE\"] I KNOW YOU'RE ALL HERE FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT. I'LL WRAP IT UP IN 60 SECONDS. IT'S A COMMON THEME TONIGHT, BUT I GREW UP IN A BLUE-COLLAR FAMILY. MY MOM WORKED MULTIPLE JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET, PARTICULARLY AFTER MY DAD DIED. AND NOW I STAND BEFORE YOU AS NEW HAMPSHIRE'S YOUNGEST STATE LAWMAKER. [APPLAUSE] BUT IT'S NOT JUST MY STORY. IT'S VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN'S STORY. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN ALSO GREW UP AS A SCRAPPY KID WITH HUMBLE BEGINNINGS. HE KNOWS THE STRUGGLE FAMILIES FACE BECAUSE HE'S LIVED THEM. HE'S NEVER FORGOTTEN WHERE HE CAME FROM AND HE SPENT HIS CAREER FIGHTING FOR FAMILIES LIKE MINE. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN HAS THE CONVICTION, COURAGE, AND MORAL CLARITY TO TAKE ON PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND THE VISION, EMPATHY, AND DETERMINATION TO LEAD US INTO TOMORROW. HE'S ALREADY HERE BUT , [LAUGHTER] PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING THE NEXT RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT IS REALLY GREAT TO BE HERE. YOU KNOW, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT I GOT TO TALK TO SOME OF THE FOLKS INSIDE , LUCAS, AS WELL AS EMELIA AND MOLLY AND DANNY, WHO'S JUST TOO YOUNG. WHEN I RAN, I GOT ELECTED AT AGE 27. I DIDN'T PLAN ON GETTING INVOLVED IN RUNNING FOR POLITICS. MY STATE WAS IN A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE A BORDER STATE. WE HAD THE EIGHTH LARGEST AFRICAN-AMERICAN POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY. AND THE PROBLEM AT THE TIME WAS WE HAD A VERY , WE HAD A SOUTHERN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR. AND WHEN DR. KING WAS KILLED MY SENIOR YEAR, WHEN I GRADUATED, WE WERE OCCUPIED BY THE NATIONAL GUARD FOR THE BETTER PART OF NINE MONTHS, DRAWING BAYONETS IN EVERY CORNER. THE ONLY CITY IN AMERICA OCCUPIED BY THE MILITARY SINCE THE CIVIL WAR. AND I GOT ENGAGED WITH A GROUP OF YOUNG DEMOCRATS TO CHANGE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN DELAWARE FROM A SOUTHERN DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO A MAINSTREAM DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I WAS ASKED AND KEPT TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO RUN FOR OFFICE AS MAINSTREAM AND LIBERAL DEMOCRATS. AND IT WAS ALREADY DUE. FINALLY , IT WAS HARD TO DO. FINALLY, THEY SAID WHY DON'T YOU RUN FOR THE COUNTY COUNCIL? IT'S A DISTRICT THREE TIMES LARGER THAN STATE SENATOR AND SEVEN TIMES AS LARGE AS A STATEHOUSE MEMBER, BECAUSE ONE COUNTY OF OURS, LIKE ILLINOIS, HAS 60% OF THE POPULATION. THE END RESULT WAS IRAN AFTER HOURS, ASSURED THAT I COULDN'T WIN BECAUSE IT WAS A REPUBLICAN DISTRICT. AND I RAN AND I WON BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE. I WAS TALKING TO SOME OF THE HIGH SCHOOL YOUNG DEMOCRATS IN THERE AND I TOLD THEM SOMETHING MY SISTER KNEW BEFORE I DID, MY YOUNGER SISTER, WHO IS MY BEST FRIEND AND MANAGED MY CAMPAIGNS. SHE WAS A TEACHER AT ONE OF MY SCHOOLS. WE ORGANIZED YOUNG PEOPLE, PEOPLE IN HIGH SCHOOL , NOT EVEN COLLEGE, IN HIGH SCHOOL , TO GET ENGAGED IN OUR CAMPAIGN. WE STARTED , THEY STARTED CALLING THEM KITTY CAMPAIGNS TO MAKE FUN OF IT. WELL, WE WON. NEXT THING I KNOW, REPUBLICANS DECIDED THEY WOULD REPORT SHOULD ME BECAUSE THE CENSUS WAS 70I IN A DISTRICT THAT WENT FROM SIX TO PRESENT REPUBLICAN TO 72% , 60% REPUBLICAN TO 72%. THEY SAID I HAD TO RUN AGAIN IN TWO YEAR. AS THEY SAY IN POLITICS, UP OR OUT. THEY COULDN'T GET ANYBODY TO RUN FOR UNITED STATES SENATE AT THE TIME. I WENT TO MY DECEASED WIFE, WHO WAS MY BEST BUDDY, AND SHE SAID EITHER GET IN OR GET OUT. I RAN THINKING I COULD HELP THE PARTY. WE PUT TOGETHER HIGH SCHOOL DEMOCRATS, HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, AND WE HAD A VOLUNTEER FORCE IN A SMALL STATE, NOT A JOKE. TOP THE COURSE AT HARVARD FOR MANY YEARS. WE PUT TOGETHER 20,000 VOLUNTEERS, MOSTLY HASKELL STUDENTS. AND THE , HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AND THE END RESULT, I LEARNED SOMETHING EARLY ON. I'LL REPEAT IT TO ALL OF YOU. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, YOU HAVE MORE INFLUENCE ON HOW YOUR PARENTS VOTE THEN THEY HAVE ON YOU. NOT A JOKE. YOU MAY SIT AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE HAVING DINNER WITH YOUR MOM AND DAD AND SAY I MET HER AND I REALLY LIKE HER. OR I MET HIM AND I REALLY LIKE HIM. YOUR PARENTS WILL PRETEND IT DIDN'T MATTER MUCH. BUT THEY WILL GO UP, NOT A JOKE, THEY SAID MY KID LIKE THAT PERSON THAT MUCH THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THERE. AND I WON. I WON BY 3100 VOTES IN A YEAR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT BEAT THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT BY 68 TO 32 POINTS. AND IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND YOUNG DEMOCRATS. [APPLAUSE] SO WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE HERE IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY CAMPAIGNING. LAST TIME, IN THE 2018 ELECTION, I WENT TO TO FOR STATES IN 59 CANDIDATES. WE WON BACK THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THAT'S WHERE I GOT CRITICIZED THAT WE WON OVER 40% OF THE HOUSE. NOT WE, THEY. TWO THINGS OCCURRED. AN AWFUL LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WERE AWAKENED, JUST LIKE MY GENERATION WAS, THIS TIME AWAKENED BY TRUMP. WE ARE AWAKENED BY THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A PRESIDENT THAT WAS KILLING AN AWFUL LOT OF MY GENERATION. THE WOMAN'S MOVEMENT WAS JUST BEGINNING AND NO ONE PAID MUCH ATTENTION. THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS IN DISARRAY AND WE HAD TO FINISH IT. WE'VE BEEN AWAKENED BY DONALD TRUMP. I SAW DONALD TRUMP SAID EVERYONE IS GOING TO SUPPORT HIM AFTER HE WENT AFTER ME AND SENATOR WARREN AND OTHERS, HE SAID, BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO REGRET. THEY ARE GOING TO REALIZE THEY GOT A HANDSOME , HOW DID HE SAY IT? THEY GOT A HANDSOME, VERY STABLE GENIUS IN THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW. [LAUGHTER] LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT GENIUS FOR A SECOND. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A GOOD FOURTH OF JULY. DID YOU SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAK TO THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL? LOOK, I GRADUATED AND IT'S A REAL EDUCATION. I GRADUATED WITH A DEGREE IN HISTORY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE. I THINK I KNOW MY HISTORY PRETTY WELL. I ALWAYS CONSIDER MYSELF A STUDENT OF AMERICAN HISTORY. BUT I GUESS I MISSED THAT WHOLE CHAPTER ON THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR. YOU KNOW THE ONE I'M TALKING ABOUT. WHEN TRUMP DESCRIBED THE AMERICAN ARMY \"MANNED THE AIR,\" \"RAN THE RAMPARTS, AND TOOK OVER THE AIRPORTS.\" I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP. TOOK OVER THE AIRPORTS IN 1770. WHOA. I MISSED THAT. I GUESS THE WRIGHT BROTHERS GOT CONFUSED, TOO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. WOW. [LAUGHTER] OH, GOD. A STABLE GENIUS. AS MY BROTHER WOULD SAY, GIVE ME A BREAK. FOLKS, LOOK. THAT'S WHAT OUR PRESIDENT DOES. HE TALKS ABOUT HIMSELF. EVERYTHING IS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. AND THE THINGS HE SAYS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP DON'T BEAR ANY RESEMBLANCE SOMETIME TO WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. I THINK WE ALL KNOW IN OUR GUT THIS ELECTION IS DIFFERENT. NO MATTER HOW YOUNG OR OLD YOU ARE. NOT BECAUSE I'M RUNNING. NOT BECAUSE GOOD PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE BUTTIGIEG IS RUNNING, A LOT OF PEOPLE. THE REASON IS BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION, ANYONE HAS FACED, WHETHER A YOUNG DEMOCRAT IN COLLEGE OR OVER THE AGE OF 60. IT IS THE SINGLE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS YOU KNOW WHY. WE WILL OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. IT WILL GO DOWN AS AN ABERRATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IT WILL TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF WORK TO PUT TOGETHER FOREIGN POLICY THAT MAKES SENSE. IT WILL TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF WORK TO REESTABLISH WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. BUT EIGHT YEARS, LITERALLY, NOT FIGURATIVELY, EIGHT YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP WILL CHANGE THE NATION OF WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. DONALD TRUMP VICIOUSNESS, BULLYING, UTTER DISREGARD FOR PEOPLE AND PERSONAL LIVES, IS TEARING THE SOUL OUT OF THIS NATION. YOU SAW IT IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED. PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE FIELDS WITH LIGHTED TORCHES, VEINS BULGING, PREACHING, AND SHOUTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC VIA , BILE THAT OCCURRED IN GERMANY IN THE 1930'S. WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND KU KLUX KLAN, LED BY DECENT, HONORABLE PEOPLE WHO SAID NOT IN MY CITY. AND HE SAID, WHEN THEY ASKED, THEY WERE FINE PEOPLE IN BOTH GROUPS. NO PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE THAT. WE SAW IT IN HELSINKI WHEN HE COUTO EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH PUTIN, TAKING PUTIN'S WORD ABOUT INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTIONS, WHICH IS GOING ON TODAY. AND THEN AT THE G20, WHEN THEY MET AGAIN, HE MADE A JOKE. OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO INTERFERE IN ELECTIONS,? ARE YOU? OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. HE EXCHANGED LOVE LETTERS WITH A MURDEROUS THUG IN KIM JONG-UN. WE SEE IT EVERY DAY AT THE BORDER, CHILDREN RIPPED FROM THE ARMS OF THEIR PARENTS, PUT IN CAGES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. WE SHOULDN'T BE SEPARATING FAMILIES. AND BY THE WAY, LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR. THIS NATION IS BIG ENOUGH THAT WE COULD'VE ABSORBED EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOT IN ANY WAY BE NEGATIVELY EFFECTED, BUT POSITIVELY AFFECTED. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A LINE. BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE IDEA THAT HE LITERALLY TOOK THE WORDS \"A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS\" OUT OF THE MONSTER THAT IS IN THE DEFINITION OF WHAT OUR SERVICE IS ABOUT. HE LITERALLY TOOK THE WORDS OUT. NO LONGER ARE THEY PART OF THE DESCRIPTION. THIS ISN'T WHO WE ARE. WE ALL KNOW WE GIVE THIS GUY FOR MORE YEARS, HE'S GOING TO FOREVER CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY. NOT A JOKE. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. WE HAVE TO BEAT HIM. AND THE BALANCE , FAILURE ISN'T AN OPTION. THAT'S WHY I PROMISE YOU, WHETHER I'M THE NOMINEE OR NOT, I'M GOING TO BREAK MY NECK TO MAKE SURE THEY GET ELECTED PRESIDENT. WE CANNOT AFFORD , [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] I KNOW IT'S, ANCIENT HISTORY BUT GO CHECK POLITICAL FACT. I INTRODUCED THE FIRST GLOBAL WARNING IN THE 1980'S THAT HAD CONSEQUENCE THAT THEY LABELED AS A GAME CHANGER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO EVERYTHING WE DO IS CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. WE KNOW THE CLOCK IS TICKING. WHETHER YOU LOOK AT OUR OWN EPA, WHICH HE HAS EMASCULATED, CUT DOWN, AND ESSENTIALLY LEFT FOR DEAD. LOOK AT THE U.N. RIGHT NOW, THEY SAY 11 YEARS. 11 YEARS LEFT TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS THAN THAT IF WE WIN BACK THE PRESIDENCY, FEWER YEARS THAN THAT. DEMOCRATS WANT TO UNTIL JANUARY, 2021. YOU MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT. I BELIEVE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE PLAN PUT FORWARD IN THIS CAMPAIGN, YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT ON MY WEBSITE. I HOPE YOU READ IT. BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME, I WANT TO POINT OUT TWO THINGS. WHAT SETS MY PLAN APART FROM OTHERS , AND THERE ARE GOOD PLANS PUT FORWARD , I FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO GET TO ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2045 OR 2050. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 15% OF THE POLLUTANTS IN THE AIR, 15%. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 85%. THAT'S WHY I SPENT SO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT WHY I WOULD IMMEDIATELY JOIN WHAT BARACK AND I PUT TOGETHER, THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD , [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] NUMBER TWO, WHAT IS NOT KNOWN ABOUT THAT ACCORD, WRITTEN INTO THE ACCORD, WE WROTE IN EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS YOU HAVE TO UP THE ANY. BUT HERE'S THE DEAL, GUYS. NOBODY IN THE WORLD BUT THE UNITED STATES HAS THE ABILITY TO LEAD THE WORLD, TO PULL IT TOGETHER, TO UP THE ANTE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, 85% OF THE POLLUTION COMES FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. WELL, BACK WHEN I WAS FIGHTING LIKE THE DEVIL IN THE 1980'S TO STOP 300 FOOT SMOKESTACKS GOING UP IN THE MIDWEST, INDIANA, AND ILLINOIS, WHAT WERE THEY DOING? DROPPING ON YOUR LIKES, POLLUTANTS , LAKES, POLLUTANTS, KILLING YOUR FISH AND WILDLIFE. WE STOPPED AT. IMAGINE , STOPPED IT. IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS. WE WILL HAVE GLACIERS MELTING, SEA LEVELS RISING. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AND I MEAN IT. THERE'S A NUMBER IN THEIR. IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH, LET ME KNOW. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT, YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS I GET CRITICIZED FOR SAYING WE HAVE TO BRING THE WORLD TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE AND MANY OTHERS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M TOLD THAT IS OLD-FASHIONED. NOTHING OLD-FASHIONED ABOUT THAT. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT GOING BACK TO WHAT NEVER WAS. I'M TALKING ABOUT WHERE IT HAS TO BE. WE'RE CRITICIZING TRUMP WITH GOOD REASON FOR ABUSING EXECUTIVE POWER. HOW MANY TIMES YOUR CANDIDATE ON THE STAGE ON THE 400 OF US RUNNING , HOW MANY THEM SAYING, IF I'M ELECTED, I WILL BY EXECUTIVE ORDER DO THE FOLLOWING? WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? THERE'S A CONSTITUTION. IT SEPARATES POWER. IT'S IMPORTANT. IT'S TO LIMIT THE ABUSE OF POWER. SO FOLKS, THERE'S TWO THINGS WE HAVE TO DO. ONE, WE HAVE TO WORK WITH REPUBLICANS WHERE WE CAN. AND WHERE WE CAN'T, GO OUT AND DEFEAT THEM, TAKE IT TO THEM. [APPLAUSE] LOOK, FOLKS, I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE GREAT LEADERS. BUT IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY WHAT ENERGIZED A LOT OF YOU IS DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT HE IS DOING. WELL GUESS WHAT, HE'S ENERGIZED THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. THE LAST INTO ANY 18, LIKE I SAID, WE WENT IN AND WON. WHAT DID WE RUN ON? WE RAN ON HEALTH CARE. I WENT INTO EVERY STATE FROM ALABAMA TO THE RED STATES, 40% OF THE VOTE LIKE MONTANA AND NORTH DAKOTA, AS WELL AS PENNSYLVANIA, WHICH WE CANNOT WHEN A PRESIDENCY WITHOUT WINNING PENNSYLVANIA. THERE'S NO MATHEMATICAL WAY TO GET THERE. ALL THESE STATES, AND WE TOOK IT TO THE REPUBLICANS. BECAUSE FOLKS FINALLY FIGURED OUT, FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD DONE WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. DID YOU HAVE ANY REPUBLICANS YOU KNOW RUNNING AROUND SAYING I WANT TO DO AWAY WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS BEING COVERED? I WANT TO DO AWAY WITH THE FACT WE'RE CUTTING OF HEALTH CARE A CERTAIN POINT? I WANT TO DO AWAY WITH THE FACT AND ON AND ON AND ON. LADIES AND GENERAL MEN, PART OF TEST GENTLEMEN, PART , LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PART OF LEADING IS EDUCATING. EVERYTHING BUT LOCUSTS DROPPED ON BARACK'S LATE WHEN HE GOT , PLATE WHEN HE GOT ELECTED. THE GREATEST ABILITY GOD GAVE MANKIND WAS THE ABILITY TO FORGET. IF THEY DIDN'T, WOMEN WOULD ONLY HAVE ONE CHILD. ALL KIDDING ASIDE, THINK ABOUT IT, GUYS. WE FORGET JUST WHAT HE FACED AND WHAT HE DID. IT WAS THE GREATEST RECESSION SHORT OF THE DEPRESSION IN THE HISTORY OF THE NIGHT STATES OF AMERICA. AND IT WAS ALL BRAND-NEW. THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A FINANCIAL RECESSION LIKE THIS BEFORE, AND REQUIRED ENTIRELY NEW THINKING AND CHANCES BEING TAKEN. AT THE SAME TIME, HE WENT OUT AND GOT OSAMA BIN LADEN AND A FEW OTHER THINGS ON HIS PLATE. [APPLAUSE] HERE'S THE DEAL. A COUPLE FOLKS HERE WERE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION BACK THEN. I USED TO SAY MR. PRESIDENT, WE GOT TO GO OUT AND TELL PEOPLE WHAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SAYS. HE SAYS I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR A VICTORY LAP. THERE'S TOO MUCH ON THE PLATE. ONCE THE ATTACK HAPPENED, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WOKE UP. THEY DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD THESE BENEFITS WHEN THEY STARTED TO BE TAKEN AWAY. FOLKS, WE HAVE SOMETHING TO WORK WITH YOU. AND I AM SO OPTIMISTIC , I KNOW EVERYBODY SAYS I'M TOO OPTIMISTIC. LOOK, I'M NOT TOO OPTIMISTIC. I KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE JOURNEY OF THIS COUNTRY. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, IF WE GO AND SHOW OUR CHARACTER AS A PEOPLE AGAIN, AS A PARTY, IF WE MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF RESTORING THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY BY GIVING THEM BACK THEIR DIGNITY, MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. HE SAID A JOB WILL BY A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IF YOU LISTEN TO BARACK, YOU WOULD THINK I CLIMBED OUT OF A COAL MINE WITH A LUNCH BUCKET IN MY HAND. I DIDN'T. MY DAD WAS A WHITE EDUCATED GUY. THERE WAS NO WORK, THOUGH. WE MOVED TO DELAWARE. EVERY TIME THERE WAS A RECESSION, SOMEONE IN OUR FAMILY, SOME NEIGHBOR WE KNEW, GOT LAID OFF OR LOST THEIR JOB. MY DAD USED TO USE THIS EXPRESSION. JOEY, A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR JIG NITTY. , DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMITTEE. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY HON HE, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. IT'S MORE THAN THAT. IT'S MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. AND LADIES IN GERMAN , LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'VE DENIED PEOPLE ARE RIGHT TO THAT DIGNITY. [APPLAUSE] YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT MAKING SURE YOU LOOK AT YOUR CHILD AND BE ABLE TO HELP THEM WHEN THEY'RE IN TROUBLE. I HEARD PEOPLE SAY HOW THEY LOST PEOPLE TO CANCER. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO CANCER THAT THEY LOVE? WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS. CAN YOU IMAGINE , IF YOU COULD HAVE ANY DIGNITY AS A FATHER, A BROTHER, A SON, A HUSBAND, A WIFE , IN MY CASE, MY SON CAME HOME AFTER A YEAR IN IRAQ, A DECORATED SOLDIER, WITH A TERMINAL DISEASE, BRAIN CANCER, GLIOBLASTOMA. THEY GAVE HIM ONLY MONTHS TO LIVE. I CANNOT FATHOM WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE. AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN I HAVE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE HELP I HAVE. I COULDN'T FATHOM WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE IF, WITH FOUR MONTHS LEFT TO GO, LYING IN PAIN IN A HOSPITAL, THEY SAID TIMES UP. YOU USED UP YOUR BENEFITS. REST IN PEACE. FOLKS, YOUR PARENTS, HOW MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR STATE TODAY, MOM AND DAD ARE SITTING AT THE KITCHEN TABLE TOMORROW MORNING SAYING WHO'S GOING TO TELL HIM OR HER WE CAN'T SEND HIM BACK TO SCHOOL? WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. WHAT IN GODS NAME ARE WE DOING TO PEOPLE? FOLKS, WE CAN PRAISE THIS ASH CHANGE THIS TAX STRUCTURE OVERNIGHT TO FIX THIS , CHANGE THIS TAX STRUCTURE OVERNIGHT TO FIX THIS. [APPLAUSE] THERE'S MORE TO SAY BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT. LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING THIS. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF YOU I HOPE ARE GOING TO RUN FOR OFFICE, YOU YOUNG DEMOCRATS. I REALLY MEAN IT. BUT HERE'S THE THING. HERE'S THE THING. WHEN I GOT ELECTED AS THE SECOND YOUNGEST SENATOR IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO BE POPULARLY ELECTED , NO, IT'S NOT , I HAD A LOT OF HELP. WHEN I GOT ELECTED, PEOPLE USED TO COME UP TO ME AND SAY WHAT YOUR SECRET, SENATOR? THERE HAD TO BE A SECRET BECAUSE HOW COULD I HAVE WON ON MY OWN? HERE'S THE DEAL, GUYS. I TELL EVERY YOUNG PERSON , AND I WILL SAY IT TO YOU YOUNG DEMOCRATS WHO WANT TO RUN. FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WORTH LOSING OVER BEFORE YOU RUN. IF YOU CAN'T DETERMINE WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO LOSE OVER AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE, DO NOT RUN FOR OFFICE. DO NOT RUN FOR OFFICE. [APPLAUSE] YOU'LL BE MUCH HAPPIER. YOU'LL BE MUCH HAPPIER DOING SOMETHING ELSE. BECAUSE IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO LOSE OVER, IT CAN BE COMMUNICATED TO PEOPLE THAT YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAY. YOU SAY WHAT YOU MEAN. AND EVEN IF YOU DISAGREE, THEY WILL GIVE YOU CREDIT AND REWARD YOU FOR IT. AND WHEN YOU GET ELECTED, I'LL NEED YOUR HELP, WHETHER I'M PRESIDENT OR NOT. I INTRODUCED THE FIRST CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO END ANY PRIVATE FUNDING OF ELECTIONS. THERE SHOULD BE PUBLIC FUNDING OF ELECTIONS. NOBODY INVOLVED. NOBODY. WE CAN CHANGE IT OVERNIGHT. [APPLAUSE] SO GOD BLESS YOU ALL. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING , I MEAN THIS NOW. THINK ABOUT THIS. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING AMERICANS FAILED TO DO WHEN WE'VE ACTED TOGETHER. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE CAN DO ANYTHING WE SET OUR MIND TO. SO GET OUT AND GO DO IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] BY THE WAY, WHEN I WAS A YOUNG SENATOR, I WAS MAKING A SPEECH. SOMEONE SAID KEEP GOING, JOE. IT'S STILL RAINING OUTSIDE. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE RAIN. I CAN'T CONTROL THAT VERY MUCH. THE REALLY, THANK YOU , BUT REALLY, THANK YOU FOR BEING ENGAGED. EVERY TIME I WALKED OUT OF MY GRANDPA'S HOUSE, KEEP THE FAITH. JOEY, GO SPREAD IT. GO SPREAD THE FAITH. [APPLAUSE] [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY.

FOLKS, THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TO GIVE ME THIS OPPORTUNITY. I SAID AT THE OUTSET THAT THE SPEECH I PLAN TO GIVE TODAY, I PLAN ON COMING WHEN WE SET THIS UP A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. TO TALK ABOUT AGRICULTURAL POLICY, UNIONS, RURAL POLICIES. BUT TOO MUCH AS HAPPENED IN THE RECENT PAST. I HAVE PREPARED FOR ME A SPEECH THAT I HOPE WOULD SET A MARKER FOR WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. YOU ALL KNOW THAT THE WORDS OF A PRESIDENT MATTER. THEY CAN MOVE MARKETS. THEY CAN SEND OUR BRAVE WOMEN AND MEN TO WAR. THEY CAN BRING PEACE. THEY CAN CALM A NATION IN TURMOIL. THEY CAN CONSOLE, THEY CAN CONFRONT AND COMFORT THOSE WHO HAVE FACED TRAGEDY. THEY CAN INSPIRE US TO LITERALLY REACH FOR THE MOON. THEY CAN ENCOURAGE US TO APPEAL TO OUR BETTER ANGELS, OUR BETTER NATURE. THEY CAN ALSO UNLEASH THE DEEPEST, DARKEST FORCES IN THE NATION. THAT IS WHAT I BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP HAS CHOSEN TO DO. WHAT HE SAID AFTER CHARLOTTESVILLE, THERE WERE, AND I QUOTE, \"VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES, I SAID THEN THAT IT GAVE LICENSE IN SAFE HARBOR TO WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND NEO-NAZIS, TO THE KU KLUX KLAN. THESE WORDS NOT ONLY STUNNED AMERICA, BUT THEY STUNNED THE WORLD. AND IN DOING SO HE HAS SIGNED A MORAL EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN THOSE SPEWING HATRED AND THOSE WITH THE COURAGE TO STAND AGAINST IT. I SAID AT THE TIME THAT WE ARE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. I SAID IT AGAIN WHEN I ANNOUNCED MY CANDIDACY. AND I SAY IT HERE TODAY. WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. THAT'S WHY, PRIMARILY, I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] CHARLOTTESVILLE WAS NO ISOLATED INCIDENT. WHEN TRUMP ANNOUNCED HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, HE CALLED MEXICANS RAPISTS. DAYS BEFORE THE MIDTERM HE FOMENTED FEARS OF A CARAVAN HEADED TO THE UNITED STATES AND CREATED HYSTERIA WHEN HE SAID , LOOK, LOOK AT WHAT'S MARCHING UP , THIS IS AN INVASION, AND INVASION. , AN INVASION. HE ASSERTED THAT IMMIGRANTS WOULD CARVE YOU UP WITH A KNIFE. MORE RECENTLY HE CALLED A MAJOR AMERICAN CENTER CITY A DISGUSTING WRATH INFECTED RODENT MASS. NO HUMAN BEING, HE SAID, WOULD CHOOSE TO LIVE , AS THOUGH THE VIBRANT AND DIVERSE COMMUNITY AROUND BALTIMORE WAS SOMEHOW LESS THAN HUMAN. AT A RALLY IN FLORIDA WHEN HE ASKED THE CROWD , HOW DO WE STOP THESE PEOPLE , MEANING IMMIGRANTS, SOMEONE YELLED BACK , SHOOT THEM. AND HE SMILED. NORTH CAROLINA, HE BASKS IN THE CHANCTS OF CENTER BACK ECHOING ACROSS THE STADIUM. HOW FAR FROM TRUMP SAYING THAT THIS IS AN INVASION TO THE SHOOTER IN EL PASO DECLARING , HOW FAR APART OF THOSE COMMENTS. HOW HARD IS IT FOR WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND NEO-NAZIS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, TRUMP US VERY FINE PEOPLE CHANTING , TRUMP'S VERY FINE PEOPLE CHANTING TO THE SHOOTER IN PITTSBURGH WHO SAID THAT THE JEWS ARE COMMITTING GENOCIDE ON HIS PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT FAR AT ALL. IT'S BOTH. CLEAR LANGUAGE AND A CODE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS FANNED THE FLAMES OF WHITE SUPREMACY IN THE NATION. HIS LOW ENERGY NAKED EYED MOUTHING OF THE WORDS WRITTEN FOR HIM CONDEMNING WHITE SUPREMACY THIS WEEK I DON'T BELIEVE FOOLED ANYONE AT HOME OR ABROAD. HIS ENERGETIC EMBRACE , THE ENERGETIC AND FACE , EMBRACE OF THIS PRESIDENT IVY DARKEST HOUR TO AND MOST HATE FILLED MINES IN THIS COUNTRY SAY IT ALL. WHEN THE WHITE NATIONALISTS RICHARD SPENCER CELEBRATED TRUMPS ELECTION BY DECLARING HAIL TRUMP AT AN ALL RIGHT CONFERENCE WHERE THE NAZI SALUTE WAS BEING USED. IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, DAVID DUKE, THE FORMER LEADER OF THE KKK SAID , THIS IS WHY WE VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. HE SAID HE'S GOING TO TAKE BACK THE COUNTRY. AFTER TRUMP TWEETED HIS GO BACK SCREEN, A LEADING NEO-NAZI WEBSITE SAID THAT THIS IS THE KIND OF NATIONALISM WE ELECTED HIM FOR. HE KNOWS IT, HE SAW IT. ON 8CHAN, A HAVEN FOR RADICALISM ON THE INTERNET, WHERE THE DECLARATION OF HATE FROM THE EL PASO SHOOTER WAS POSTED, ONE COMMENTATOR WROTE A TRUMP IS HELPING TO NORMALIZE THE MOST EXTREME RADICAL SENTIMENTS BECAUSE OF HIS PERCEIVED AUTHORITY CARRYING SO MUCH WEIGHT. WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS RISING TIDE OF WHITE SUPREMACY IN AMERICA. AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO ENCOURAGES AND EMBOLDENS IT. THE STATISTICS ARE CLEAR. EXTREMISM IS ON THE RISE IN AMERICA. THE SOUTHERN POVERTY CENTER FINDS THAT OF THE 1020 HATE GROUPS OPERATING IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2018, THAT IS HOW MANY THERE ARE, THEY POINTED OUT THAT WHITE NATIONALIST GROUPS HAVE SURGED BY OVER 50%. IN 2017, AND ACTIVE SHOOTER WITH TIES TO WHITE EXTREMISM CLAIMED 135 VICTIMS AND 70 KILLED. ACCORDING TO THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE, ALL BUT ONE OF THE 50 EXTREMIST LINKED MURDERS COUNTED IN 2018 HAD DIRECT LINKS TO WHITE SUPREMACISTS. HIS OWN FBI DIRECTOR RECENTLY TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS THAT EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUPS, WHITE NATIONALISTS, POSED THE GREATEST THREAT TO RACIALLY MOTIVATED DOMESTIC TERRORISM. WHAT HAS TRUMP DONE? HE HAS POURED FUEL ON THE FIRE. REACH WEEDING POSTINGS FROM EXTREMISTS AND WHITE NATIONALISTS , REACH WEEDING , RE-TWEETING POSTINGS FROM EXTREMISTS AND WHITE NATIONALISTS. COUNTERING POLICIES THAT BARACK AND I PUT IN PLACE TO FIGHT TERRORISM HERE AT HOME. CAN BARELY BRING HIMSELF TO USE THE WORD WHITE SUPREMACY. AND EVEN WHEN HE SAYS IT, HE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BELIEVE IT. HE SEEMS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT LOSING THEIR VOTES THAN BEATING BACK THIS HATEFUL IDEOLOGY. HE SAYS THAT GUNS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM IN MASS SHOOTINGS. THE ISSUE IS MENTAL HEALTH. IT'S A DODGE. HATRED ISN'T A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. I CAN TELL YOU, AS THE GUY ALONG WITH SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO GOT THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN AND THE HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES BANNED IN THIS COUNTRY FOR 10 YEARS, IF ELECTED PRESIDENT WE WILL DO IT AGAIN. WE WILL DO IT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] 100 ROUNDS IN DAYTON. 30 ROUND CLIPS IN EL PASO. THEY WILL BE BANNED. AND WHEN WE DO IT, WE WILL PUT IN PLACE A BUYBACK PROGRAM TO GET AS MANY AS WE NEED MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS OF WAR OFF THE STREET. AND WE NEED , WE NEEDED DOMESTIC TERRORISM LAW. WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT INFRINGING ON ANYONE'S FREE SPEECH. IN TAMPERING WITH ANYBODY'S LIBERTIES. QUITE SIMPLY, WE HAVE TO MAKE THE SAME COMMITMENT AS A NATION TO ROOT OUT DOMESTIC TERRORISM AS WE HAVE A NATIONAL TERRORISM. I WISH I COULD SAY THIS ALL BEGAN WITH DONALD TRUMP AND WILL END WITH HIM. BUT IT DIDN'T AND I WON'T. AMERICAN HISTORY IS NOT A FAIRYTALE. THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION HAS BEEN A CONSTANT PUSH AND PULL FOR 243 YEARS BETWEEN THE AMERICAN IDEAL THAT SAYS WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL AND THE HARSH REALITY OF RACISM THAT HAS LONG TOLD US APART. , TORN US APART. THE SAME DOCUMENT THAT PROMISED TO SECURE THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY TO OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY ALSO A LOVE FOR SLAVERY AND THE SO-CALLED 3\/5 COMPROMISE THE DISCOUNTED THE VERY HUMANITY OF BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA AT THE TIME. AND NOW THE TRUTH IS, BOTH ELEMENTS ARE PART OF THE AMERICAN CHARACTER. AT OUR BEST, THE AMERICAN IDEAL WINS OUT. BUT IT'S NEVER A ROUTE, IT'S ALWAYS A FIGHT AND IT'S A BATTLE THAT IS NEVER FULLY FINISHED. GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING. THOMAS JEFFERSON WROTE WHAT MANY BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENT, CIVIL DOCUMENT IN HUMAN HISTORY. HE WAS A SLAVE HOLDER. WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO OUR AMERICAN IDEALS. JEFFERSON HIMSELF DIDN'T. BUT WHAT HE WROTE HAS PULLED US TOWARDS JUSTICE FOR MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES AND STILL DOES. REMAINING THIS NATION'S NORTHSTAR. TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUE CLUCKS CLAN. AFTER THE WAR, WE SAW A RISE IN THE PLAN. IT WAS BEATEN DOWN ONLY TO RISE AGAIN IN THE 20'S. IN AUGUST OF 1925, 30,000 FULLY CLAD KLANSMAN IN THEIR ROBES AND POINTED HATS MARCHED DOWN PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE IN THE STREETS OF WASHINGTON. IMAGINE. IMAGINE THAT TODAY. AND THEN THEY WERE ONCE AGAIN BECOME BACK AS THEY WERE AFTER THE CIVIL WAR. HOW QUESTION MARK THE COURTS, THE PRESS, AND YES, PRESIDENTS STOOD AGAINST THEM. AND THAT IS THE POINT. OUR INSTITUTIONS OFTEN IMPERFECTLY STOOD AGAINST HATE AT MOMENTS WHEN WE WERE MOST TESTED. AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE'S APT UP IN THE PAST. GEORGE H.W. BUSH RENOUNCING HIS MENTOR , MEMBERSHIP IN THE NRA. PRESIDENT CLINTON AFTER OKLAHOMA CITY. GEORGE W. BUSH GOING TO A MOSQUE AFTER 9\/11. PRESIDENT OBAMA AFTER CHARLESTON . PRESIDENTS WHO LED, WHO OPPOSED, CHOSE TO FIGHT FOR WHAT THE BEST OF AMERICAN CHARACTER IS ABOUT. THERE'S DEAFENING SILENCE NOW. SADLY, WE DON'T HAVE THAT TODAY. OUR PRESIDENT HAS ALIGNED HIMSELF WITH THE DARKEST FORCES IN THIS NATION. IT MAKES WINNING THIS BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION THAT MUCH TOUGHER. HARDER. TRUMP DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT DID. ROOSEVELT SAID THAT THE PRESIDENCY IS \"PREEMINENTLY A PLACE OF MORAL LEADERSHIP. HE DOESN'T SEE WHAT JFK DID WHEN HE SAID ONLY THE PRESIDENT REPRESENTS THE NATIONAL INTERESTS. HE'S BLIND TO WHAT LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON SET OF THE OFFICE WHEN HE SAID \"NOTHING MAKES A MAN COME TO GRIPS MORE DIRECTLY WITH HIS CONSCIENCE THEN THE PRESIDENCY. TRUMP OFFERS NO MORAL LEADERSHIP. SEEMS TO HAVE NO INTEREST IN UNIFYING THE NATION. NO EVIDENCE THAT THE PRESIDENCY HAS AWAKENED HIS CONSCIENCE IN THE LEAST. INDEED, WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WITH A TOXIC TONGUE WHO HAS PUBLICLY AND UNAPOLOGETICALLY EMBRACED A POLITICAL STRATEGY OF HATRED, RACISM AND DIVISION. SO, IT IS UP TO US, AS IT WAS IN THE 20'S. IT IS UP TO US. WE ARE LIVING THROUGH A RARE MOMENT IN THIS NATION'S HISTORY WHERE OUR PRESIDENT ISN'T UP TO THE MOMENT. WHERE OUR PRESIDENT LACKS THE MORAL AUTHORITY TO LEAD. WHERE OUR PRESIDENT HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH GEORGE WALLACE THAN HE DOES WITH GEORGE WASHINGTON. YOU KNOW , [APPLAUSE] WE ARE ALMOST 330 MILLION AMERICANS. WE WILL HAVE TO DO WHAT OUR PRESIDENT CAN'T. STAND TOGETHER. STAND AGAINST HATE. STAND UP FOR WHAT IS BEST. OUR NATION'S BEST. IN THIS NATION, WE BELIEVE WHEN WE ARE AT OUR BEST. WE BELIEVE IN HONESTY. DECENCY. TREATING EVERYONE WITH RESPECT. GIVING EVERYONE A FAIR SHOT. LEAVING NOBODY BEHIND. GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. DEMONIZING NO ONE, NOT THE POOR, THE POWERLESS, THE IMMIGRANT OR THE OTHER. LEAD BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, NOT BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER. THAT IS THE LOUDEST , THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO STAND AS A BEACON TO THE WORLD. BE A PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. IT'S A CODE. IT'S A UNIQUELY AMERICAN CODE. IT'S WHO WE ARE. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T GET IT. BUT THIS PRESIDENT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT LIKE EVERY OTHER NATION ON EARTH, WE ARE UNABLE TO DEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES AMERICA BY RELIGION, BY ETHNICITY, OR BY TRIBE. YOU CAN'T DO IT. AMERICA IS AN IDEA. AN IDEA STRONGER THAN ANY ARMY. EGER THAN ANY OCEAN. MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY DICTATOR OR TYRANT. IT GIVES HOPE TO THE MOST DESPERATE PEOPLE ON EARTH. BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE OUR VALUES UNDER ASSAULT, OUR DEMOCRACY IS AS WELL. A FREE PRESS, AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY. A LEGISLATURE THAT IS THE COEQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. THESE OTHER GUARDRAILS. [APPLAUSE] THESE OTHER GUARDRAILS OF OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY ARE WRITTEN INTO OUR CONSTITUTION. IF YOU HAVE NOTICED, FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN UNDER ATTACK. PHRASES LIKE FAKE NEWS. ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. THEY ARE NO JOKE. THEY ARE INSIDIOUS. THEY ARE CORROSIVE. JUST LOOK AROUND THE WORLD. THE WORST DESPOTS ARE USING TRUMPS LANGUAGE TO JUSTIFY THEIR OWN ABUSES OF POWER. TRUMP IS TRYING TO WEAKEN OUR INSTITUTIONS, THE PRESS, THE COURTS, CONGRESS, PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY CHECKS ON HIS POWER. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. THE ABUSE OF POWER. THERE'S ONE THING I CAN'T STAND AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T, THE ABUSE OF POWER, WHETHER IT IS A BOSS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HIS OR HER WORKERS, OR A MAN RAISING HIS HAND TO A WOMAN OR A CHILD. OR A PRESIDENT WHO IS RUNNING ROUGHSHOD OVER EVERYTHING THIS COUNTRY BELIEVES. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] NO MATTER HOW OLD OR YOUNG YOU ARE, YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN YOUR LIFETIME. WE ARE BEING REMINDED EVERY DAY THAT THERE IS NOTHING GUARANTEED ABOUT DEMOCRACY. NOT EVEN HERE IN AMERICA. WE HAVE TO CONSTANTLY EARN IT. WE HAVE TO PROTECT IT. WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA, AS LINCOLN NAMED US, IS THE LAST BEST HOPE ON EARTH. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHY. IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BIGGEST ECONOMY. THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD BUT IT IS NOT WHY WE ARE AMERICANS. THE REASON IS, WHAT WE BELIEVE, THE MOST POWERFUL IDEA IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD THAT I THINK BEATS IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY, IT BEATS AND ALL OF US, NO MATTER YOUR RACE, ETHNICITY, YOUR GENDER IDENTITY, YOUR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, NO MATTER YOUR FAITH. IT BEATS IN THE HEARTS OF THE RICH AND POOR ALIKE, HE UNITES AMERICA, WHETHER YOUR ANCESTORS WERE NATIVE TO THESE SHORES OR BROUGHT HERE FORCIBLY AND ENSLAVED, OR IMMIGRANTS FROM GENERATIONS BACK, LIKE MY FAMILY FROM IRELAND, OR THOSE COMING TODAY, LOOKING TO BUILD A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. THE AMERICAN CREED THAT WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL WAS WRITTEN LONG AGO, BUT THE GENIUS OF EVERY GENERATION OF AMERICANS HAS OPENED IT WIDER AND WIDER, TO INCLUDE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED IN A PREVIOUS GENERATION. THAT IS WHY IT HAS NEVER GATHERED DUST IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS. IT IS STILL ALIVE TODAY, MORE THAN 200 YEARS AFTER ITS INCEPTION. AND I HONEST TO GOD DON'T BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP SEES IT THAT WAY. ON JANUARY 20, 2017, IN HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS, DONALD TRUMP PAINTED A DARK, BLEAK ACTOR OF OUR COUNTRY IN CRISIS, WHEN HE DECLARED, AND I QUOTE, \"THIS AMERICAN CARNAGE STOPS RIGHT HERE, IT STOPS RIGHT NOW.\" BUT AS A SITTING PRESIDENT, TRUMP'S ANGER, HATE AND DIVISIVENESS, PITTING AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, PREYING ON OUR DIVISIONS AND DOING NOTHING, NOTHING ABOUT THE ENDEMIC AND EPIDEMIC OF GUNS THAT IS FUELING A LITERAL CARNAGE IN AMERICA. WE NOW HAVE MORE MASS SHOOTINGS IN 2019 SINCE JANUARY, THEN WE HAVE DAYS THAT HAVE PASSED SINCE JANUARY 1, 2019. AS OF MONDAY, ACCORDING TO DATA FROM THE GUN VIOLENCE ARCHIVES, THERE HAVE BEEN 255 MASS SHOOTINGS IN THE FIRST 217 DAYS OF THIS YEAR. WE CAN'T LET THIS GO ON. WE CAN'T, AND I WILL NOT, LET THIS MAN BE REELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] WE CAN'T. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, THIS INCOMPETENCE, HIS IMMORALITY, HIS CARNAGE STOPS WITH US, RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, STARTING IN THE MIDWEST. LIMIT TO FOUR YEARS, AND I BELIEVE HISTORY WILL LOOK BACK ON THIS PRESIDENT AS AN ABERRANT MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. BUT IF DONALD TRUMP IS REELECTED, HE WILL FOREVER AND FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. IF WE GIVE DONALD TRUMP FOUR MORE YEARS, THIS WILL NOT BE THE COUNTRY AND VISIONED BY WASHINGTON AND ADAMS AND JEFFERSON. IF WE GIVE DONALD TRUMP FOUR MORE YEARS, THIS WILL NOT BE THE NATION BOUND TOGETHER BY LINCOLN. IF WE GIVE DONALD TRUMP FOUR MORE YEARS, THIS WILL NOT BE THE NATION LIFTED UP BY ROOSEVELT OR INSPIRED BY KENNEDY. IT WILL NOT BE THE NATION THAT BARACK OBAMA PROVED BENDS TOWARD JUSTICE. [APPLAUSE] THE DANGER OF DONALD TRUMP AND THE ALT RIGHT POSED TO THIS NATION IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL OR EXAGGERATED. IT IS REAL. THE CORE VALUES OF THIS NATION, OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD, OUR VERY DEMOCRACY, EVERYTHING THAT MAKES AMERICA AMERICA, ARE AT STAKE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS, EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM. WE HAVE TO SHOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. AND YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES. , TRUTH OVER LIES. [APPLAUSE] IF WE STAND TOGETHER, IF WE STAND TOGETHER, WE WILL WIN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY, IF WE STAND TOGETHER AND GET UP AND REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. PERIOD. THANK YOU, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.

PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE FIRST LADY ARE ON THEIR WAY TO EL PASO, TEXAS, WHERE A GUNMAN SHOT AND KILLED AT LEAST 22 PEOPLE AT A WALMART ON SATURDAY. A REPORTER COVERING THE EVENT REPORTS EL PASO POLICE ARE WORKING TO DE-ESCALATE CONFRONTATIONS AND CONTROL THE CROWD. AND AT THE MEMORIAL SITE THIS MORNING, SUPPORTERS OF THE PRESIDENT FACED PROTESTERS WHO WERE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO EL PASO.

{"SpeechID":"CSPANJB88201917","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2019-08-08","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden at Iowa State Fair","RawText":"HELLO, IOWA. GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL. I AM JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND. I'M GOING TO BE VERY BRIEF AND QUICK WITH YOU. I'M RUNNING FOR THREE REASONS. WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. WHAT WE SOW OUT OF CHARLOTTESVILLE, THE HATE AND VENOM WE SAW, AND THE PRESIDENT SAYING THAT THE GROUPS WHO MET HIM AS LAW , AS WELL AS THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS KILLED, WHAT DID HE THINK ABOUT THEM, HE SAID THEY WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE IN BOTH GROUPS. VERY FINE PEOPLE. NO SITTING PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THE ONLY THING THAT HAS HAPPENED IS IT HAS GOTTEN WORSE, IT TO DIVIDE US CAN DIVIDE US IN A WAY THAT IS TOTALLY CONTRARY TO WHO WE ARE. WE REALLY ARE IN A FIGHT TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE LET THE WORLD IN THE PAST NOT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE THE MOST PARTIAL NATION IN THE WORLD, BUT IT IS NOT THE EXERCISE OF OUR POWER, IT IS THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. WE'RE LOSING THAT KIND OF INFLUENCE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT IS VERY DAMAGING. THE SECOND REASON I AM RUNNING IS I WANT TO RESTORE THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY IS THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE MIDDLE CLASS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE TO RISE UP. THE POOR OT HAVE A ROAD UP. WHEN THE MIDDLE CLASS DOES WELL, EVERYBODY DOES WELL. THE POOR DO WELL, THE WEALTHY DO WELL, AND THE MIDDLE CLASS IS THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER. IT IS FALLING APART RIGHT NOW. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION SAYING THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE A LIFE THAT THEY HAD. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, HE SAID A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY AND RESPECT. IT IS ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY , HOW CAN YOU HAVE THIS NOTION OF BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN YOUR EYE AND SAY THEY WILL BE OK IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE? WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU LOOK AT A CHILD WHO HAS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT, OR WHEN YOUR CHILD OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE HAS A TERMINAL DISEASE LIKE MY SON DID. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE WATCHING HIM COMING HOME FROM IRAQ WITH AN INCURABLE DISEASE GIVEN MONTHS TO LIVE AND AN INSURANCE COMPANY COULD COME IN AND SAY YOUR TIME IS UP. SUFFER IN PEACE THE LAST FOUR MONTHS. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO HAVE AN EDUCATION FOR YOUR CHILD THAT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. THAT IS WHY WE SHOULD BE OUT THERE, AND WE CAN AFFORD IT, TRIPLING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON TITLE I SCHOOLS. RAISING SALARIES FOR TEACHERS. MAKING SURE THAT WE DEAL EARLY ON WITH ALL OF THOSE THINGS. WE KNOW WE NEED TEACHERS. MY WIFE IS A FULL-TIME TEACHER. WE ARE IN A SITUATION NOW WHERE ONE CHILD FOR EVERY PSYCHOLOGIST IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM, THERE ARE 1700 KIDS. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WE CAN AFFORD TO CHANGE THIS IF WE JUST GET RID OF SOME OF THESE GOD-AWFUL TAX CUTS THAT WERE PASSED. THE IDEA THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION THAT WE HAVE TRILLIONS OF LOOPHOLES IN THE LAW. YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY JUSTIFY $500 BILLION WORTH OF LOOPHOLES. I CAN MAKE SURE EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY HAS ADEQUATE INSURANCE. BUILT ON OBAMACARE, MAKE SURE IT HAS A PUBLIC OPTION CAN INCREASE THE PROSPECT OF LOWERING DRUG PRICES. HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE LEFT? HOW MUCH? 15 SECONDS? TO SPEAK? OH! Y'ALL ARE IN REAL TROUBLE THEN, MAN. THAT'S A BAD THING TO TELL ME I'VE GOT MORE TIME TO SPEAK. THE IDEA THAT WE CANNOT GAIN CONTROL AND GIVE PEOPLE A FIGHTING CHANCE IS NOT CORRECT. THERE USED TO BE A BASIC BARGAIN IN AMERICA. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AGREED ON IT. WE DISAGREED ON THE EXTENT OF IT, BUT WE AGREED AT THE END OF THE ROOSEVELT ADMINISTRATION, AND THAT IS IF YOU CONTRIBUTED TO THE WELL-BEING OF THE COMPANY YOU WORK FOR, YOU GET A SHARE OF THE BENEFITS. IF IT WENT WELL, YOU DID WELL. THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE ANYMORE. WE HAVE ADOPTED A POSITION IN AMERICA THAT SAYS THE ONLY PEOPLE ENTITLED TO REWARDS ARE STOCKHOLDERS, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY JOB CREATORS. I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE FOLKS DELIVERING THE GRAINS TO THE MILL, THEY ARE JOB CRITTERS. THE FOLKS WHO MAKE THE AUTOMOBILE, THEY CREATE JOBS. I KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY OR ORDINARY, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN HAVE A CHANCE. THE IDEA THAT WE DON'T REWARD WORK AS MUCH AS WELL IS BIZARRE. , AS MUCH AS WEALTH IS BIZARRE. WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE THE TOP 1% PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN YOU DO BECAUSE IT IS MOSTLY CAPITAL GAINS. MORE THAN A TEACHER, FIREFIGHTER, A COP. IT IS RIDICULOUS. WE SHOULD BE REWARDING WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. WE SHOULD BE RAISING THE CORPORATE TAX RATE. THIS IS ALL WITHIN OUR CAPACITY TO DO THIS. SO MUCH MONEY. SO MUCH IN TAX BREAKS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED THEM. BY THE WAY THE WEALTHY KNOW THEY , DON'T NEED THEM. THEY ARE NOT BAD PEOPLE, BUT THEY DON'T NEED ANOTHER TAX CUT. IF YOU ARE MAKING MORE THAN $10 MILLION, I AM NOT YOUR GUY. YOU DON'T NEED A TAX CUT. AND YOU KNOW IT. BUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED A TAX CUT , MAKE SURE WE CAN PROVIDE FOR FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE COULD PUT EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY PERSON WHO IS ELIGIBLE, QUALIFIED, AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS IN THEIR 50'S BECAUSE OF AUTOMATION BACK TO BE RETRAINED. WE CAN DO THAT ALL FOR ABOUT $6 BILLION A YEAR. ELIMINATE ONE LITTLE THING, STEPPED-UP BASIS. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS BECAUSE I USED TO BE LISTED AS THE POOREST MAN IN CONGRESS. IF YOU HAVE A CAPITAL GAIN, YOU ARE ABOUT TO CASH IT IN, YOU GET HIT BY TRUCK, GOD FORGET, LEAVE IT TO YOUR CENTER DOT OR, THEY PAY NO TAX , LEAVE IT TO YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER, THEY PAY NO TAX. IT COULD FOR EVERY SINGLE QUALIFIED PERSON IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR FREE, OR TRADE SCHOOL. CUTTING IN HALF THE COST OF COLLEGE. THERE ARE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE TO CHANGE THINGS IN THIS COUNTRY. IN ADDITION TO THAT, I LOVE THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO GLOBAL WARMING. YOU KNOW THAT OUT HERE IN IOWA. YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T EXIST. I HEARD A FARMER TODAY SAY IT IS NOT CAUSED BY HUMANS, BUT I HAVE A PROBLEM. I HAVE A PROBLEM. WELL, THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM. IF WE DON'T PROVIDE FOR PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO DRINK , POSITION WHERE THEY CAN BREATHE CLEAN AIR, WE DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR BASIC FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. WOULD NEED RE-JOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD, WHICH I HELPED PUT TOGETHER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ONE THING PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT RECORD WHICH WE NEGOTIATED, IT CALLS FOR NATIONS TO UP THE ANTE EVERY TWO YEARS. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 15% OF GLOBAL WARMING. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS 85%. WE DO EVERYTHING PERFECTLY AND THEY DON'T GET ON THE STICK, WE ARE ALL STILL IN TROUBLE. I KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE WORLD LEADERS. I KNOW ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THEM. I KNOW HOW TO GET IT DONE. THIS IS THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE U.S. AND TO THE WORLD. IT IS REAL. AND IT IS NOT JUST 11 YEARS. WE HAVE ABOUT 10 YEARS BEFORE WE LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STOP THE EROSION THAT IS OCCURRING NOW. IT IS REAL. HERE'S THE DEAL, YOU SAW WHAT YOU DID WITH WIND. I REMEMBER AT A STATE FAIR 10 YEARS AGO, 12 YEARS AGO, TALKING ABOUT WIND. HOW YOU CAN PROVIDE ENERGY FROM WIND. GUESS WHAT, A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A GOOD IDEA. THEN YOU STARTED DOING IT. IT CREATED 10,000 NEW JOBS AND DIDN'T CAUSE CANCER, AS THE PRESIDENT SAYS. IT GENERATED GROWTH. WE CAN INVEST. WE WILL INVEST. $44 BILLION IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT DEAL WITH SEQUESTERING OF CARBON. YOU FARMERS OUT HERE CAN HAVE AN ENTIRE NEW LIFE. THEY CAN BE THE FIRST GROUP OF AMERICANS TO ACTUALLY GET A CARBON-FREE ENVIRONMENT. IF WE DO THIS, WE WILL CREATE 10 MILLION NEW JOBS. AND IT'S REAL. IF WE INVEST IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE FUTURE. WE SHOULD BECOME THE NET EXPORTER OF THIS CAPABILITY AND TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DO THAT. WE UNDERESTIMATE OUR CAPACITY. GOING BACK TO HEALTH CARE, WE CAN CONTROL DRUG PRICES. MY PROPOSAL IS, AND I RAN WHAT THEY CALL THE MOONSHOT DEALING WITH CANCER, AND AFTER THAT SET UP THE BIDEN CANCER INITIATIVE. HERE'S THE POINT, WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF SOLVING SO MANY CHRONIC DISEASES. IT IS WITHIN OUR CAPACITY TO DO IT. BUT WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO OUT AND FUND IT. FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE MILITARY KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED DARPA. IT ALLOWS THE MILITARY TO DO RESEARCH. WE SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING WITH HEALTH CARE. WE SHOULD SET UP THE SAME OPERATION. HARPA, MEANING HEALTH CARE ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE DISEASE OF ALZHEIMER'S, EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY BED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND HOSPITAL WILL BE FILLED WITH AN ALL-TIME IS PATIENT. NO DRUG COMPANY WILL MAKE THAT KIND OF INVESTMENT. WE SHOULD BE INVESTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS JUST LIKE WE DID IN THE DEFENSE FORMAT WITH FAT OBESITY, ALL OF THE CHRONIC DISEASES THAT ARE OUT THERE. WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BREAK THROUGH. WE CAN DO A MILLION BILLION CALCULATIONS PER SECOND. WE ARE SO FAR ADVANCED THAT WE ARE KEEPING OUR HEAD IN THE SAND. WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN THAT, NOT INVESTING IN MORE TAX CUTS FOR THE VERY WEALTHY. LASTLY, I SAY THE THIRD REASON I AM RUNNING IS TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. FOLKS, FOLKS, I AM TOLD BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT YOU CANNOT UNITE THE COUNTRY. THAT BIDEN ON ONE SIDE, BIDEN HAS BEEN AROUND TOO LONG. THE OTHER IS BIDEN IS NAIVE. I'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. YOU THINK BEING AROUND A LONG TIME, YOU WOULD LEARN SOMETHING. WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AFTER THREE YEARS ALREADY OF THIS GUY HAVE DECIDED THAT A LOT OF WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT IS HOKUM. LOOK THIS LAST ELECTION IN 2018 IN THE COUNTRY. I WENT TO 69 CANDIDATES I WENT INTO PURPLE STATES AND RED STATES AND IN THOSE STATES WE WON BACK 41 SEATS. BEATING REPUBLICANS , BY THE WAY, I WANT TO REPRESENT EVERYBODY, BUT HERE'S THE DEAL, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, WE RAN ON HEALTH CARE. IT WASN'T UNTIL I STARTED TAKING AWAY HEALTH CARE THAT EVERYBODY , THEY STARTED TAKING AWAY HEALTH CARE THAT EVERYBODY REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. 100,000 PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO GET COVERAGE BECAUSE OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. ON AND ON. WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS WE ARE ABLE TO GO OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS PROTECTED. BUILDING ON OBAMACARE, RESTORING THE HISTORIC DEAL THAT WE DID. IN ADDITION TO THAT, ADDING A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION TO IT SO YOU CAN BUY INTO IT. EVERY SINGLE , BUT YOU ARE ABLE TO KEEP IF YOU LIKE YOUR EMPLOYER-BASED POLICY, YOU CAN KEEP THE POLICY, AS LONG AS THEY KEEP THE POLICY. IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY. IT COSTS ABOUT $740 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS FOR THE BUT GUESS WHAT, IT DOESN'T COST $30 TRILLION. THE MUTUALLY DOLLARS , $30 TRILLION, WHICH WILL RAISE MIDDLE-CLASS TAXES. BERNIE IS GOING TO TELL YOU THAT. THERE WILL BE A WITHHOLDING TAX FROM YOUR PAYCHECK. WE CAN COVER EVERYBODY. AND WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE THE CHOICE THEY WANT. IN TERMS OF UNIFYING THE COUNTRY, WE NEVER LIVED UP TO IT, BUT AMERICA HAS BEEN AN IDEA. IT IS THE MOST UNIQUE IDEA. NOT A JOKE. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN DEFEAT AMERICA IS AMERICA. THERE IS NO ARMY STRONG ENOUGH, NO DICTATOR POWERFUL ENOUGH, NO OCEAN WIDE ENOUGH THAT CAN OVERCOME WHAT WE WANT TO DO. WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT TO DO, IF WE REMEMBER WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE REASON I DID MY LAST ANNOUNCEMENT IN PHILADELPHIA WAS TO MAKE A POINT THAT WE ARE A NATION THAT IS UNIQUE. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR. WE THE PEOPLE, ETC. WE HAVE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO THAT. BUT WE HAVE NEVER ABANDONED IT BEFORE. WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT. JEFFERSON DIDN'T LIVE UP TO IT, HE HAD SLAVES. BUT EVERY SINGLE GENERATION HAS BENT THE ARC MORE TOWARD INCLUSION. EVERY GENERATION. THAT IS WHY WE ARE WHO WE ARE. WE ARE, WE ARE THE MOST UNIQUE IDEA. IT IS AN IDEA WE CANNOT ABANDON. AND FOLKS, WE ARE BETTER PREPARED TO OWN THE 21ST CENTURY THAN ANY NATION IN THE WORLD BY A LONG SHOT. WHEN I GOT ELECTED AS A 29-YEAR-OLD KID TO THE SENATE, I WAS LABELED THIS YOUNG IDEALIST. THIS GUY WHO WAS OPTIMISTIC. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY, WITH ONE EXCEPTION, THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN. IF WE GET RID OF DONALD TRUMP CAN WE HAVE A CLEAR PATH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS IN THE WORLD. OUR WORKERS ARE THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS WORKERS IN ASIA. WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES THAN IN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. EVERY MAJOR CHANGE THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THE LAST 20 YEARS HAS COME OUT OF A RESEARCH UNIVERSITY. PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE FEDERAL AGENTS. THEY ARE NOT. YOU OWN THEM, YOU PAY FOR THEM. THEY BELONG TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE THE MOST AGILE VENTURE CAPITALISTS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE ONE OF THE MOST EDUCATED PUBLICS IN THE WORLD, IF WE IN FACT INVEST IN THEM. THERE ISN'T ANYBODY OR ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHO CAN COMPETE WITH US IF WE INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE, IF WE INVEST IN NEW WE ARE. REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DO. THIS IS MY CONCLUDING COMMENT TO YOU ALL , IT IS TIME TO REMEMBER WHO IN GOD'S NAME WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOTHING WE HAVE EVER DECIDED TO DO THAT WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DO, PERIOD. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. WE HAVE NEVER NEVER NEVER FAILED WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER. IT IS TIME TO GET UP. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. EVEN HIS SUPPORTERS KNOW WHO HE IS. WE HAVE GOT TO LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER FACTS. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, JOIN ME. I COULD USE THE HELP. WE MUST DEFEAT THIS PRESIDENT TO CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH. I GUESS I TAKE QUESTIONS NOW, HUH? DON'T LET ANYBODY KNOW I DID NOT USE ALL MY TIME. I HAVE A BAD REPUTATION OF GOING OVER ALL THE TIME. YES, SIR? GIVE YOU A MIC, OR , YES, YOU CAN BUY ME ANOTHER ICE CREAM. I ALREADY HAD ONE. HE SAID, CAN I BUY YOU AN ICE CREAM, AND WHO WAS MY FAVORITE HISTORICAL FIGURE. I THINK MY FAVORITE HISTORICAL FIGURE , THERE IS A COUPLE OF PHILOSOPHERS WHO I FIND UNDERSTOOD HUMAN NATURE BETTER THAN MOST PEOPLE. BUT IN TERMS OF POLITICAL FIGURES, MAYBE MY FAVORITE POLITICAL FIGURE, IT IS A TOUGH CALL, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY IT IS THOSE PEOPLE WHO GAVE AMERICA HOPE. MADE THEM BELIEVE IN WHO WE ARE. YOU SAID NOT A PRESIDENT. I WOULD HAVE TO START OFF WITH JEFFERSON, EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T LIVE UP TO IT. HE IS THE GUY THAT WROTE THAT INCREDIBLE DOCUMENT. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED IN THE DIRECTION TO PROVIDE US WITH THE KIND OF HOPE AND EXPECTATION ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. MY FAVORITE LINE FROM JOHN KENNEDY'S SPEECH ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON WASN'T WHAT MOST PEOPLE REMEMBER. WHEN I REMEMBER THE MOST IS WHEN HE SAID, WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE. I REFUSE TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER WHAT WE CAN DO IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS TIME TO GET THE HELL UP AND START TO MOVE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BILLION A YEAR RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS MY PLAN? MY PLAN IS TO GATHER UP , I HAVE MET WITH MOST OF THE LEADING SCIENTISTS IN THE COUNTRY ALREADY. MY PLAN IS TO SET UP A SYSTEM WHEREBY WE INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TERMS OF RESEARCH. NO DRUG COMPANY WANTS TO OR CAN DO BECAUSE THEY CANNOT TAKE THE RISK. I'M TIRED OF BEING TOLD WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER. WE FOUND CLEAR ANSWERS. WE USED TO THINK THAT CANCER WAS A SINGLE CELL, THAT RESIDED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY. WE NOW KNOW THERE ARE 204 DISTINCT TYPES OF CANCER THAT REQUIRE DIFFERENT TYPES OF THERAPIES. THE SAME KIND OF RESEARCH HAS TO TAKE PLACE DEALING WITH ALZHEIMER'S. NOT JUST TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO GET IT, BUT IT SAVES , IT IS A GIGANTIC POSITIVE INVESTMENT. WE PAY FOR IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. WE CAN CHANGE THE WAY IT REQUIRES A DEDICATION TO SAY WE CAN INVEST. IT WILL TAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO IT. WE CAN AFFORD TO DO IT. WE CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO DO IT. YES, MA'AM? 30 SECONDS? THE COURTS HAVE TURNED STRONG TO THE RIGHT. I WILL NOT APPOINT ANYONE TO THE COURT , YOU NOTICE I PRESIDED OVER MORE SUPREME COURT HEARINGS THAN ANYONE EVER HAS BECAUSE I WAS CHAIRMAN FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE PEOPLE I WILL PUT ON THE COURT ARE WILL BE LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO , LIKE A WOMAN WHO WORKED FOR ME, ELENA KAGAN. THE FOLKS WHO UNDERSTAND , THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE LAWYERS, THE QUESTION IS, ARE THERE UNENUMERATED RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTION. FANCY WAY OF SAYING UNLESS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A RIGHT OF PRIVACY IN THE CONSTITUTION, AS MOST LEADING SCHOLARS AGREED, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT ALL THE THINGS WE CARE ABOUT SO MUCH. I WILL NOT APPOINT ANYONE TO THE COURT WHO DOES NOT SHARE THAT BASIC PHILOSOPHY. THANK YOU.

THIS IS ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF. [APPLAUSE] ARE YOU GUYS PUMPED TO SEE THE VICE PRESIDENT? I AM THE UNITED STATES NAVY VETERAN, A NEW HAMPSHIRE BUSINESS OWNER, A FORMER DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE POLICY EXPERT AND SOMEONE WHO IS TIRED OF THE DIVISION AND DECLINE OF AMERICAN VALUES WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL REPAIR, AND REVITALIZE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALLIES AND NEIGHBORS TO RESTORE OUR GEOPOLITICAL LEADERSHIP. THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE VITAL TO OUR NICE , NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE WELL-BEING OF ALL AMERICANS. AS SOMEONE WORKING ON THE FRONT LINES TO MITIGATE THE SUICIDE NUMBERS IN THE VETERAN COMMUNITY, I CAN SAY THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD A START OVER. WE MUST IMPROVE AND EXPAND UPON THE MEDICAL CARE ACT AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS THE EXPERIENCE, THE KNOWLEDGE, AND AN ACTIONABLE PLAN TO DO THAT. AS A VETERAN, I KNOW THAT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN EXPERIENCES , APPRECIATES THE COSTS AND SACRIFICES OF SERVING OUR COUNTRY. BOTH OF HIS SONS SERVED THIS COUNTRY AND HE UNIQUELY UNDERSTANDS THE CHALLENGES. ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PRESIDENT OBAMA DATA POSSIBLE FOR ME AS AN LGBT SERVICEMEMBER TO SERVE OUR NATION OPENLY AND WITHOUT FEAR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SOMETHING I COULD NOT DO WHEN I FIRST STARTED MY MILITARY CAREER AND I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THAT. BUT WE CANNOT MOVE BACKWARDS ON CIVIL LIBERTIES. IT IS AN HONOR OF A LIFETIME TO INTRODUCE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) FRMR V.P. BIDEN: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. HELLO, KEENE. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW , WELL, I LOVE YOU TOO AND I LOVE THIS TOWN. THE DANGER IS I MAY COME BACK TO OFTEN. THIS IS GOD'S COUNTRY. A BEAUTIFUL TOWN AND I REALLY MEAN IT. I WANT TO THANK BY THAT I WANT TO START BY THANKING PRESIDENT TREADWELL. SHE NEEDS THIS LIKE ANOTHER HOLE IN HER HEAD. I ALSO WANT TO STAY THAT THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY BUT I HAVE A TRADITION THAT I HAVE HONORED SINCE AND MOST PEOPLE DO SINCE I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN NATIONAL POLITICS. I NEVER CRITICIZE A PRESIDENTS FOREIGN POLICY WHEN HE IS A BROAD AND I MEAN THAT SINCE EERILY. I WILL HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY AND I DID YESTERDAY ABOUT THE PRESIDENTS FOREIGN POLICY AND WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE JEEZ EVAN AND WHAT IS IN FACT GOING ON WITH RUSSIA ETC. WHICH HAS ME GREATLY CONCERNED BUT I WILL NOT TAKE THE TIME TODAY. IT IS AN O MISSION BY INTENTION , OMISSION BY INTENTION BECAUSE I DO NOT THINK IT APPROPRIATE TO CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT ALL HE IS A BROAD AS IT RELATES TO FOREIGN POLICY. [CHEERING] AND I WANT TO SAY TO ERIK, YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB FOR AN AWFUL LOT OF WARRIORS THAT COME HOME IN REAL TOUGH SHAPE. I SHOWED ERIK , I HAVE A SCHEDULE THAT I'VE CARRIED EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST 470 YEARS. [LAUGHTER] BUT ON THE BACK, FOR I THINK IT IS THE LAST 12 YEARS, I CARRY WITH ME A LITTLE BLACK BOX THAT I HAVE IN THE BOTTOM. AND I HAVE MY STAFF EVERYTHING THAT MORNING, AND NOW I CAN DO IT ONLINE, CONTACT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT. I WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY, EXACTLY THE NUMBER OF FALLEN ANGELS THAT HAVE DIED OR BEEN WOUNDED. AND AS OF TODAY, YESTERDAY, WHEN I SPOKE IT WAS 6883. UNFORTUNATELY TODAY, IT IS 6885. I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY WE ARE OVER 5000 OR 6000. EVERY ONE OF THESE WOMEN AND MEN , AND SOME OF THEM BELONG TO YOU, EVERY ONE OF THESE FALLEN ANGELS HAS LEFT AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY BEHIND AND THEY DESERVE TO BE REMEMBERED. FOLKS, WHAT ERIK IS DOING IS WORKING WITH THESE FOLKS. IT IS NOT ON THIS LIST. IT IS OK. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WHAT IS NOT ON THIS LIST IS THAT THERE ARE ROUGHLY 300,000 SOLDIERS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN SINCE WE WENT IN WHO IN FACT ARE COMING HOME WITH POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS. MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING OF SUICIDE, OR MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE DYING FROM SUICIDE THAN THERE ARE BEING KILLED IN ACTION AND WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO IT. AND IT RELATES TO EVERYTHING FROM MENTAL HEALTH, STRAIGHT THROUGH TO DRUG ABUSE WHICH IN MANY CASES IS A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE ACROSS THE BOARD. AND FOLKS, IT ALSO RESULTS IN ACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ALMOST BEYOND THEIR CONTROL. AND SO, WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU, ERIK, FOR YOUR COMMITMENT AS A LIEUTENANT IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THESE WOMEN AND MEN. [APPLAUSE] AND, THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. AND OBVIOUSLY, I AM NOT GOING TO TRESPASS ON TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME BECAUSE IT COULD KEEP YOU STANDING FOR HOURS. BUT FOLKS, LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING WHAT I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT. BUT JUST MENTIONED BRIEFLY. I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW, AS OF YESTERDAY, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS FILED A BRIEF IN CONGRESS, THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES TO SAY THAT LGBTQ PEOPLE HAVE NO CIVIL RIGHTS. [BOOING] HE IS ALREADY CHALLENGING THE RIGHT TO MARRY, BANNING TRANSGENDER SERVICE MEMBERS , WE HAVE TO PASS THE EQUALITY ACT WHICH SOME OF YOU INVOLVED IN THIS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AND UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL GET IT PASSED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, WHEN I LAUNCHED MY CAMPAIGN, AND MADE MY STOP HERE RIGHT AFTER MY ANNOUNCEMENT, I SAID YOU WOULD BE SEEING A LOT OF ME. THE BAD NEWS IS THAT YOU WILL BE SEEING A LOT OF ME. BECAUSE IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU GUYS HOLD ONE OF THE TWO KEYS TO GET THROUGH THE GATE. AND THIS IS , I HAVE TO ADMIT TO YOU, I GET IN TROUBLE WITH MICE HALF WHEN I SAY THIS BUT GOD, THIS IS GOD'S COUNTRY APPEARED. YOU GUYS ARE LUCKY TO BE WHERE YOU ARE. BUT LOOK, I SAID WHEN I LAUNCHED THAT YOU WOULD SEE A LOT OF ME BUT I AM HERE THIS MORNING TO SAY THERE IS SOMETHING I THINK IS TRULY FRIGHTENING FOR NOT ONLY OUR NATION BUT FOR THE WORLD. THIS ADMINISTRATION IS ACTUALLY, IT SEEMS TO ME, TO BE FALLING APART. WHEN THE PRESSURE OF ECONOMIC, WHEN THE ECONOMY IS TEETERING ON A RECESSION, I THINK WE ARE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO HANDLE NOT JUST THE ECONOMIC PIECE OF IT BUT THE EMOTIONAL CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT HAPPENS. THE TRADE WAR IN CHINA IS BLOWING UP. WE JUST LEARNED THAT THE UNITED STATES CREATED 500,000 FEWER JOBS THAN WE THOUGHT LAST YEAR. WARNING SIGNS FROM AN INVERTED BOND MARKET TO COLLAPSED MANUFACTURING ARE ALL AROUND US. AND WE ARE ONLY GOING TO MAKE THIS ADMINISTRATION ACT MORE RADICALLY. THERE IS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AS I SAID BUT I WILL BE THAT FOR ANOTHER DAY AND KEEP WITH MY TRADITION BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN TROUBLE AND HE KNOWS IT. WE WILL HAVE TO FIGHT EVEN HARDER TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE WORST INSTINCTS COMING OUT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. I PREDICT THEY WILL INCREASE. NOT DIMINISH. INCREASE. I SAID IT MANY TIMES IN THIS CAMPAIGN THAT WE CAN OVERCOME FOUR YEARS , CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME IN THE BACK? WE CAN OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION. BUT IF WE GIVE IT ANOTHER FOUR YEARS, THIS WHITE HOUSE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY AND FOREVER CHANGE THE CULTURE , THE CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE POINT , WE CANNOT JUST BE A CAMPAIGN ABOUT EATING PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE IS TRAFFICKING IN SOME OF THE UGLIEST AND DARKEST FORCES THAT HAVE LONG RUN THROUGH THE HISTORY OF THIS NATION. A SIMPLE CAMPAIGN IS NOT ENOUGH TO BEAT HIM. THERE HAS TO BE A MOVEMENT. THERE HAS TO BE A MOVEMENT, A MOVEMENT GROUNDED ON THE VALUES AND IDEALS OF THE FINEST AS A NATION. AMERICA IS UNIQUE. UNIQUE IN ALL THE WORLD. NO OTHER NATION WAS FOUNDED THE WAY WE WERE. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. NO OTHER NATION WAS FOUNDED ON THAT PRINCIPLE. WE THE PEOPLE, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION , IT IS UNIQUE IN HISTORY. NO NATION, NO TYRANT CAN TAKE AS DOWN. ONLY AMERICA CAN RIP ITSELF APART. SO THIS HAS TO BE A MOVEMENT TO STAND UP FOR WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE BELIEVE AND WE DEMOCRATS HAVE A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY. I THINK, AN OBLIGATION TO DO MORE THAN JUST WIN. FOLKS, PRESIDENT WILSON I BELIEVE WAS THE ONE THAT SAID THE PARTY IS WORTH NO MORE THAN THAT FOR WHICH IT STANDS. WE HAVE TO STAND FOR THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO REPAIR THE MORAL FABRIC OF THIS COUNTRY. THE CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST TALKS ABOUT , HE SAID THERE IS AN INVISIBLE MORAL FABRIC THAT HOLDS UP SOCIETY THAT IS BEING RIPPED, RENTDED AND HAS TO BE RESTORED. WE HAVE TO REACH BEYOND OUR PARTY IN MY VIEW AND UNIFY THE COUNTRY AND WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THE NATION. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO BE WHAT WE ONCE WERE AGAIN. WE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO OUR OBLIGATIONS. BUT WE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THEM BEFORE. WE NEVER ABANDONED THEM COMPLETELY. WE HAVE TO BE A NATION OF VALUES OF HONESTY AND DECENCY AND TREATING EVERYONE WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY. GIVING EVERYONE A FAIR SHOT. GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. DEMONIZING NO ONE. THE EMIGRANT, THE POOR, AND THE OTHER AS IS HAPPENING NOW AND LENDING THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, NOT JUST THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER, IT LEAD THAT WAY. AND STAND AS A BEACON FOR THE WORLD REMEMBERING THAT WE ARE SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. WE ALL KNOW IN OUR GUT THAT THIS ELECTION IS DIFFERENT. NOT BECAUSE I AM ON IT. BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL SAY I AM TALKING ABOUT ME. WE ALL KNOW THIS IS DIFFERENT. WE KNOW. THE WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT SAYS , SAY MATTER. THEY CAN MOVE MARKETS. THEY CAN SEND OUR BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN TO WORK. THEY CAN CREATE PEACE. THEY CAN UNLEASH THE DEEPEST, DARKEST FORCES OF THIS NATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. AND THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THAT IS WHY I'M RUNNING. THE SECOND REASON I'M RUNNING , [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FRMR V.P. BIDEN: AND BY THE WAY, CAN YOU THINK OF ANY OTHER PRESIDENT WHO WHEN YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE SAID THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES? NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ANDREW JOHNSON. THERE IS A SECOND REASON I'M RUNNING, I'M RUNNING BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD AMERICA. YOU BUILT AMERICA. MY MOTHER AND FATHER BUILT AMERICA. IT WAS BUILT BY HARD-WORKING, ORDINARY PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. THAT IS THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION AND HE SAID IT ALL THE TIME AFTER HE LOST HIS JOB IN SCRANTON AND HAD TO MOVE WHEN COLE DIED. MY DAD WAS A SALESPERSON. THERE WAS NO WORK. HE WOULD ALSO THAT SHE WOULD ALWAYS SAY, JOEY, A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS ABOUT EATING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK AND MEAN IT. MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAD TO DO IT IN THE GREAT RECESSION THAT WE HAD. A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE CALL IT THE LONGEST WALK , THE LONGEST WALK FOR A PEERING IS TO GO UPSTAIRS AND TELL THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER THAT THEY CANNOT GO BACK TO SCHOOL. MOMMY OR DADDY LOST THEIR JOB AND YOU WILL GO IN LIVE WITH GRANDPA FOR A WHILE. TODAY, , I KNEW MY DAD MEANT IT THAT IT WOULD BE OK. HE THOUGHT IT COULD HAPPEN AND IT HAPPENED. BUT TODAY, MANY PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT. THEY CANNOT DO IT. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS. THE MAJORITY OF THE MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE DO NOT PLEAD THEIR CHILDREN WILL HAVE A CHANCE. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE-CLASS IN THE WORLD. I AM PRETTY DARN SOPHISTICATED ABOUT WHAT BUILT THE NATION. AND HERE IS THE DEAL , THE REASON WHY WE NEED A STRONG MIDDLE CLASS, THE MIDDLE CLASS DOES WELL, EVERYONE DOES WELL. THE POORER MOVE UP AND THE WEALTHY DO VERY WELL. AND FOLKS, THE REASON FOR AMERICA'S SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC STABILITY THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES HAS BEEN A STRONG MIDDLE CLASS. BELIEVING ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. AND WE ARE LOSING THAT NOW. I WILL BE REBUILDING THE MIDDLE CLASS TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. EVERYBODY. BY THE WAY, I HAVE A NUMBER OF BRILLIANT ECONOMISTS THAT WORK FOR ME. WHEN YOU ASK THEM TO DEFINE THE MIDDLE CLASS, THEY WILL GIVE YOU A NUMBER. BUT IT IS NOT A NUMBER. IT IS A VALUE SET. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO OWN YOUR OWN HOME. BEING ABLE TO SEND YOUR KID TO A PARKED AND OTHER WILL COME HOME SAFELY. BEING IN A SITUATION TO SEND YOUR KID TO A LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL AND IF THEY DO WELL THEY CAN GO BEYOND. AND IF THEY DO QUALIFY, YOU CAN FIGURE HOW TO PAY FOR IT. BEING ABLE TO TAKE YOUR MOM HOME AFTER YOUR DATA PASSES AWAY AND HOPE YOUR CHILDREN NEVER HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. YOU HAVE A LITTLE BREATHING ROOM. IT IS A VALUE SET. BUT EVERY AMERICAN, IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT VALUE SET, IT MATTERS TO EVERY FAMILY THAT THERE BE A GOOD EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. A CLIMATE THAT YOU CAN BREEZE, THE AIR, AND DRINK THE WATER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [INDISCERNIBLE] FRMR V.P. BIDEN: I DON'T HAVE A MIDDLE GROUND. [INDISCERNIBLE] NO FRACKING. FRMR V.P. BIDEN: YOU CAN FRACK WITH ME LATER. WE WILL TALK LATER. [INDISCERNIBLE] FRMR V.P. BIDEN: I'M HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU LATER. ANYWAY, BUT BY THE WAY, I AGREE WITH HER. HERE IS THE DEAL , IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN DIGNITY, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE A HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT IS AFFORDABLE AND DECENT. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A SICK CHILD WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND YOU LOOK AT THAT CHILD AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT? NOT ONLY IS THAT CHILD IN TROUBLE BUT IT DEPRIVES YOU OF YOUR DIGNITY. OR YOU ARE BEING TOLD SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A HUSBAND, A WIFE, A SON, OR A DAUGHTER WHO HAS TERMINAL CANCER. AND THEY SAY , BY THE WAY, HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO CANCER? OR ARE DEALING WITH IT? IT IS THE SAME IN EVERY SINGLE CROWD I SPEAK TO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE FOR MY SON BEAU, A DECORATED VETERAN COMING HOME FROM THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN AND AFTER BEING IN A WAR IN IRAQ FOR A YEAR AND TWO YEARS LATER CONTRACTING TERMINAL CANCER. THEY GAVE HIM A MONTH TO LIVE, HE OUTLIVED THE MONTH BUT DID NOT OUTLIVE THE PROGNOSIS. HE WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF DELAWARE DETERMINED TO FINISH HIS JOB AND HE DID. I CANNOT IMAGINE LOOKING AT MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AND MY TWO GRANDCHILDREN LYING IN BED AND IF AN INSURANCE OFFICER HAD COME IN AND SAID , BY THE WAY, YOUR TIME IS UP. YOU HAVE OUTRUN YOUR COVERAGE. YOU ARE FINISHED. FOLKS, THIS IS ABOUT NOT ONLY THE HEALTH OF OUR FAMILIES, IT IS ABOUT , WHAT IS THE WORST THING FOR A PARENT? TO LOOK AT A CHILD WITH AN OPPORTUNITY OR A PROBLEM AND NO THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP THEM. NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP THEM. THAT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO FINISH THE JOB ON HEALTH CARE. WHEN WE PASSED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, I TOLD PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL? OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. I DID NOT KNOW , THANK GOD MY MOM WAS NOT AROUND. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY. YOU KNOW HE MADE HIS TOWARD PROGRESS AND EXTENDING HEALTH INSURANCE TO SOME 20 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE A BEFORE. AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANT, PROVIDING PROTECTIONS FOR MORE THAN 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE NOW HAVE TO FINISH THAT JOB. WE HAVE TO MAKE HEALTH CARE RIGHT , A RIGHT TO AND NOT A PRIVILEGE. AND GIVE EVERYONE THE PEACE OF MIND THAT THEY DESERVE. MAKE THAT REMAIN A PUBLIC OPTION. IT IS THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION, MY WIFE, WHO IS A TEACHER AND WHO IS TEACHING NOW, BACK IN THE CLASSROOM AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHERE SHE TEACHES IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA, AND SHE HAS AN EXPRESSION , ANY COUNTRY THAT OUT EDUCATES US WILL OUTCOMPETE US. WE HAVE TO ELIMINATE THE FUNDING GAP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN MINORITY WHITES AND , MAJORITY WHITES AND NONWHITES DISTRICTS, BETWEEN RICH AND POOR DISTRICTS. THAT IS WHY I HAVE PUT A PLAN IN TO TAKE TITLE I FUNDING FOR DISTRESSED SCHOOLS IN A DISTRICT AND TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPEND FROM $15 BILLION TO $45 BILLION. WE NEED TO BRING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO FUND THIS. INVESTING $400 MILLION AS NO ONE ELSE HAS SUGGESTED IN RESEARCH AND ENERGY TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION. PARTNERING WITH FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO DEVELOP THE NEXT GENERATION OF I\/O FUELS AND WORKING WITH FARMERS TO CAPTURE CARBON. BUILDING CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND HAVE THE CHARGING STATIONS IN PLACE FOR 2030. A RAILROAD SYSTEM AND YOU NEED ONE HERE IN YOUR STATE, BY THE WAY, IN MY VIEW. PUTTING AMERICA ON A COURSE FOR ZERO EMISSIONS AND A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. FINALLY, I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE NEED TO UNIFY THIS NATION. I KNOW I AM TOLD THAT I FIND IT FASCINATING, SOME OF MY 300 OPPONENTS , I AM ONLY KIDDING. THERE ARE A LOT OF QUALIFIED PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND MAY. THAT I KNOW I AM BEING ATTACKED FOR BEING NAIVE ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PULL A NATION TOGETHER. IF WE CANNOT PULL A NATION TOGETHER, WE ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE AND WILL GET ANYTHING DONE. WE WILL JUST ENGAGE IN THE GREATER ABUSE OF A POWER , OF A PRESIDENT. THE ONLY WAY WE WILL GET ANYTHING DONE IN THIS COUNTRY IS BY WORKING TOGETHER. THE PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED TO BE PRESIDENT FOR HIS BASE. I WILL BE PRESIDENT FOR EVERY AMERICAN. EVERY AMERICAN. EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. TRUTH OVER LIES. AND SCIENCE OVER FICTION. LOOK, FOLKS, LET ME CONCLUDE BECAUSE I KNOW I'M KEEPING YOU STANDING TOO LONG. HERE IS THE DEAL , I GET FRUSTRATED AND THE PRESS IS PROBABLY TIRED OF HEARING ME SAY THIS. I GET FRUSTRATED WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN WHILE THEY WALK AROUND. FOLKS, FOLKS , THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND THIS NATION'S CAPACITY. WHEN I GOT ELECTED WHEN I WAS 29 YEARS OLD TO THE SENATE AND I WAS BROUGHT UP TO BE SWORN IN THEY SAID I WAS A YOUNG IDEALIST AND AN OPTIMIST. I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR CHANCES THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. WE HAVE TO FIRST GET RID OF DONALD TRUMP IN ORDER TO DO IT. SO VOTE. THINK ABOUT IT. WE HAVE THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES AND THE UNITED STATES THAN IN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. WE ARE IN A POSITION IN THE U.S. WHERE OUR WORKERS ARE THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS THEY ARE IN ASIA. WHAT ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT? WHAT ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT? IT IS TIME TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. ON THE HEALTH FRONT, WHY DON'T WE SET UP WHICH I'M GOING TO DO IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, A SECTION JUST LIKE YOU HAVE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. IT IS CALLED DARPA. ADVANCED RESEARCH PRODUCTS , PROJECTS. WHY DON'T WE DO THE SAME IN HEALTH CARE? WE SHOULD BE DEALING WITH ALZHEIMER'S, DIABETES, CANCER. NO OTHER GROUP CAN DO THAT BUT WE CAN DO IT. WE CAN DO IT. AND WE CAN GET IT DONE. FOLKS, THE OPPORTUNITIES , THIS YOUNG MAN STANDING IN THE FRONT, HIS GENERATION IS GOING TO SEE MORE INCREDIBLE CHANGE IF WE MOVE FORWARD AND ARE ABLE TO TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY THAN IN THEE NEXT 10 YEARS THAN YOU OR I HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST 50 YEARS. WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF SO MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE. I REALLY MEAN IT. THIS IS A GENUINE OPPORTUNITY. AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY TAKE OUT DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO STANDS IN THE WAY OF ALL THESE THINGS BUT UNITE THE COUNTRY IN A COMMON PURPOSE. A COMMON PURPOSE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN, AGREE ON THE ISSUES WITHIN A SPAN THAT IS RATIONAL. BUT IT IS OUR POLICIES THAT ARE BROKEN. THEY ARE UGLY, MEAN. AND THEY ARE DIRECTED BY A WHITE HOUSE THAT IS NOW PREACHING DIVISION BASED ON RACE, RELIGION, AS IN SEXUAL ORIENTATION , IT IS JUST WRONG. WE HAVE TO BRING IT BACK TOGETHER. AND SO FOLKS, I WILL BE BACK AND GO INTO GREAT DETAIL AND I'M HAPPY TO DO IT AND PROVIDE TO ALL OF YOU THE ABILITY TO KNOW IN GREEN DETAIL , IN GREAT DETAIL ALL OF MY POSITIONS IN GREAT DETAIL. BUT FOLKS, ONE THING IS CERTAIN, I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL IN FACT ALONE THE 21ST CENTURY IF IN FACT WE INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE, REMEMBER WHO WE ARE, AND REMEMBER IT IS \"WE THE PEOPLE, WE THE PEOPLE ARE CO GOD BLESS YOU ARE AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.

WE SHOULD HAVE FOUR YEARS CLEAN AND FREE. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN DO. A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO CUT BACK [INDISCERNIBLE] ON THE PRIVATE COLLEGES. NO INTEREST ON ACCUMULATING DEBT WHEN YOU GET BEYOND $30,000. YOU WILL DO FINE. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND YOUR PAIR AND TO MAKING A GREAT SACRIFICE. I APPRECIATE YOUR BATTLE WITH CANCER WITH BEAU. EVERYTHING YOU BATTLED. AND THE MOONSHOT AND EVERYTHING. I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING. CANCER IS PERSONAL WITH ME. MY NAME IS GENE. FRMR V.P. BIDEN: LET ME GIVE YOU A PHONE NUMBER.

NEW HAMPSHIRE ISRAEL TOUGH. , IS A REAL TOUGH. YOU GUYS HAVE GOT TO CHANGE IT. WE SHOULD CONDITION THE SUPPORT BASED ON WHETHER THE STATE WILL STEP UP. YES, I HAVE. LOOK AT MY PLAN.

BOTTOM LINE, THREE THINGS. WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IN THE STATE THEY ARE NOT SUPPORTING. IS SOMETHING LIKE 9%. IT USED TO BE THAT STATES WERE PAID TO SUPPORT UNIVERSITIES. SECONDLY, STUDENT DEBT IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY BACK UNLESS WHEN YOU GRADUATE, YOU'RE MAKING MORE THAN $135,000. AND WHEN YOU PAY BACK, IT SHOULD NOT BE A 10% RATIO. AND IF YOU GO INTO PUBLIC SERVICE YOUR DEBT SHOULD BE FORGIVEN. COMMUNITY COLLEGE SHOULD JUST BE FREE CUTTING IN HALF THE COST FOR COLLEGE EDUCATION. WE CAN AFFORD IT AT $6 BILLION A YEAR AND ELIMINATE JUST ONE OF THOSE TAX CUTS, WE COULD PAY FOR IT ALL. I AM TEACHING, BEFORE THAT I WAS A REHAB MANAGER. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT DESPITE WHICH UPSIDES, I AM VOTING FOR JOE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE CAME UP WITH A. , WITH THAT.

THEY TOLD ME I HAVE ABOUT 10 MINUTES. I BETTER GET GOING. MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN AND I AM HERE FOR JEANNIE CHICANE. , JEANNE SHAHEEN. AND TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. FOLKS, YOU ALL KNOW IN YOUR BONE THIS ELECTION IS DIFFERENT THAN ANY WE HAVE EVER FACED. THIS PRESIDENT HAS UNLEASHED THE DEEPEST, DARKEST FORCES IN THIS NATION. HE HAS ASSIGNED MORAL EQUIVALENCE TO THOSE VIEWING HE , HATE AND THOSE THAT HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND AGAINST IT. I SAID AFTER WE SOLVE THOSE FOLKS WALKING ON THE FIELD CARRYING TORCHES IN CHARLOTTESVILLE THAT WE WERE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. AND WE ARE. THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. WE HAVE TO REBUILD. WE HAVE TO REBUILD. THIS NATION. WE HAVE TO REBUILD DEATH THE MIDDLE CLASS IS BEING CRUSHED. THE POOR IS GETTING POORER AND INCOME EQUALITY , INCOME INEQUALITY IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH MADE WORSE BY THE GOD-AWFUL TAX CUT THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS PASSED THAT BENEFITS NO ONE BUT THE SUPER WEALTHY. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY, YOU BELT THIS COUNTRY. THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND UNIONS BUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. IT IS TIME WE START TO REWARD WORK OVER WEALTH. WHY IN GOD'S NAME SHOULD A NURSE, A FIREFIGHTER, A POLICE OFFICER, A TEACHER , WHY IN GODS NAME SHOULD THEY PAY AT A HIGHER TAX RATE THAN SOMEONE MAKING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS? IT IS WRONG AND IT WILL CHANGE IN MY ADMINISTRATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE TO GUARANTEE AND WE CAN, IT IS WITHIN OUR POWER, GUARANTEE EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY AMERICAN THAT HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT AND NOT A PRIVILEGE. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT COVERED MORE THAN 20 MILLION PEOPLE NEVER COVERED BEFORE, WHEN I DID WILLIAM PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. NOW COVERED. WE WILL GO FURTHER. WE WILL PROVIDE A PUBLIC OPTION MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE, EVERYONE, IF THEY DO NOT LIKE THE PLAN THEY HAVE, CAN CHOOSE THE PUBLIC OPTION AND ANYONE, ANYONE THAT CANNOT AFFORD IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY THE ENROLLED IN IT, ANYONE QUALIFYING FOR MEDICAID. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE TO MAJOR THAT WE HAVE TO MAJOR THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS. ACCESS TO ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND A PORTABLE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WHICH I DO PROVIDE FOR. IT IS TIME, IT IS TIME THAT WE REMAKE THE AMERICAN EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT REPUBLICANS SAY THEY CARE ABOUT EDUCATION. MY DAD USED TO SAY , DON'T SHOW ME WHAT YOU VALUE, SHOW ME YOUR PLEDGE AND I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT YOU VALUE. THEY DO NOT VALUE EDUCATION. I WILL TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPEND ON TITLE I. IT WOULD PROVIDE RAISES FOR TEACHERS MAKING SURE EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA, 3, 4, 5 YEARS OLD CAN GO TO PRE-K, KINDERGARTEN AND REAL SCHOOL AND INCREASE THEIR CHANCES OF SUCCESS DRAMATICALLY. MAKING SURE THAT EDUCATION IS AVAILABLE BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE COUNTRY WHO WANTS TO GO TO A TRADE SCHOOL OR WHO WANTS TO GO ON TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IT SHOULD BE FREE AND WE CAN AFFORD IT. WE CAN AFFORD IT NOW. FOLKS, THE GREATEST CRISIS OF OUR TIME IS CLIMATE CHANGE. WE MUST BEGIN TO GET THIS UNDER CONTROL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WOULD IMMEDIATELY CALL FOR A $400 BILLION INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR ALTERNATIVES , NEWS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD BRING US DOWN TO NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050. AND I WOULD IMMEDIATELY REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD WHICH OUR ADMINISTRATION PUT TOGETHER BECAUSE THE REST OF THE WORLD IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR 85% OF THE PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO LEAD THEM AND THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP NOW. FOLKS, OUR PRESIDENT IS NOT UP TO THIS MOMENT. WE ALL KNOW THAT. WHERE HE LACKS THE MORAL AUTHORITY TO LEAD THIS PRESIDENT , THIS PRESIDENT HAS MORE COMMON WITH GEORGE WALLACE THEN WITH GEORGE WASHINGTON. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE 330 MILLION AMERICANS THAT HAVE TO DO WHAT THIS PRESIDENT CANNOT DO. STAND TOGETHER. STAND UP AGAINST. STAND UP AGAINST THIS GOD-AWFUL SITUATION WE FACE WITH HIS AND HIS PRESIDENCY. STAND UP FOR OUR BEST AND WHAT OUR NATION BELIEVES. WE BELIEVE IN HONESTY, DECENCY, TREATING EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. YOU BRING EVERYONE A FAIR SHOT AND LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND AND GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. DEMONIZING KNOW WHEN. NOT THE POOR OR THE POWERLESS. THE IMMIGRANT, THE OTHER. AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, LEADING NOT BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER BUT BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE AS WE ALWAYS HAVE. WE ARE BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. IT IS THE CODE, THE AMERICAN CODE, IT IS WHO WE ARE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES NOT GET IN. AMERICA IS AN IDEA. AN IDEA THAT IS STRONGER THAN ANY ARMY, BIGGER THAN ANY OCEAN, AND MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY DICTATOR OR TYRANTS. IT GIVES HOPE TO THE HOPELESS. AND, NOT ONLY ARE OUR VALUES UNDER ATTACK, OUR VERY DEMOCRACY IS. WE HAVE NOW LEARNED THAT NOTHING IS GUARANTEED ABOUT DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE TO EARN IT, WE HAVE TO PROTECT IT, WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. THE MOST POWERFUL IDEA IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD BEATS IN THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. IT BEATS IN ALL OF US. THE AMERICAN CREED. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. WE THE PEOPLE IS THE MOST UNIQUE EXPERIMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE GENIUS OF EVERY GENERATION, UP TO THIS ONE WITH THIS PRESIDENT, OF EVERY GENERATION IS WE HAVE OPENED OUR ARMS WIDER AND WIDER TO INCLUDE MORE PEOPLE IN THAT ARC. THAT IS WHY IT HAS NEVER GATHERED DUST IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS. IT IS STILL ALIVE TODAY MORE THAN 200 YEARS AFTER IT INCEPTION. WE CANNOT AND I WILL NOT LET THIS MAN BE REELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. LIMIT THE FOUR YEARS. I BELIEVE HISTORY WILL LOOK BACK AT THIS PRESIDENCY AS AN ABERRANT MOMENT IN TIME. BUT IF DONALD TRUMP IS REELECTED , IF DONALD TRUMP IS REELECTED, HE WILL FOREVER AND FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. DONALD TRUMP DOES POSE , IT IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL, HIS THREAT TO THIS NATION. HE DOES POSE A REAL THREAT. EVERYTHING THAT IS MADE IN AMERICA IS AT STAKE. NOW, WE HAVE TO SHOW THEM WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. AND YES, YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER LIES. FOLKS, FOLKS, I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES THAN I AM TODAY. WE ARE BETTER POSITIONED THAN ANY NATION AND THE WORLD TO LEAD THE 21ST CENTURY. WE HAVE THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL ECONOMY. WE HAVE THE GREATEST RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES THAN ALL OF THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. WE FIND OURSELVES WITH A WORKFORCE THAT IS THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS WORKERS IN ASIA. SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS TIME TO GET THE HELL UP. IT IS TIME TO STOP WALKING AROUND WITH OUR HEADS DOWN. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WE CAN DO ANYTHING. WE CAN DO ANYTHING AT ALL WE SET OUR MINDS TO. ANYTHING. IT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. WE ALL HAD TO LEARN ABOUT JOHN KENNEDY'S SPEECH ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON. THE ONE LINE IN THAT SPEECH , MY FRIENDS HAVE HEARD ME REPEAT THIS OVER THE YEARS I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THAT MADE THE MOST SENSE TO ME. HE SAID WHEN ANSWERING THE UNSPOKEN QUESTION WHY WE ARE DOING THIS , HE SAID, BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE, I REFUSE TO POST ON ONE MORE DAY TAKING BACK THIS COUNTRY. THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE AMAZING. WE ARE IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO LEAD THE WORLD LIKE WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO IT BEFORE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE CAN DO THIS. THIS IS OUR MOMENT. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

LIVE AT NOON EASTERN THURSDAY HERE ON C-SPAN ALSO ONLINE AT C-SPAN.ORG AND ON THE FREE C-SPAN RADIO APP. CAMPAIGNING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TODAY, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN CALLED FOR THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE SPOKE TO SUPPORTERS IN ROCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE. THANK YOU ALL AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. SO EXCITED THAT WE HAVE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITH US TODAY IN ROCHESTER WHERE I LIVE. [APPLAUSE] SO I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING JOE FOR QUITE A WHILE AND WHAT I HAVE SEEN ON HIS PERSONAL SIDE IS HIS WARMTH AND HIS CARING AND THE WAY HE TAKES TIME OUT TO HEAR PEOPLE. AND IT'S A LOVELY BEAUTIFUL TRAIT, BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT DEFINES JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN'S INTELLECT IS INCREDIBLE. JOE BIDEN'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD AND OUR PLACE IN IT AND HIS UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT PEOPLE LIVE THROUGH IN THIS STATE AND IN AMERICA EVERY DAY. HE COMES FROM WORKING-CLASS ROOTS. HE UNDERSTANDS WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE AND HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO BE AN ADVOCATE FOR ALL OF US THROUGH THESE YEARS. I'LL TELL YOU ON THE VICE PRESIDENTS AGAINST WOMEN ACT. I HAD A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WORKED ON THAT WITH HIM SAY TO ME, IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT JOE BIDEN. BUT AFTER HE GOT THAT PASSED, HE DIDN'T LEAVE IT BE. HE MADE SURE WOMEN WOULD HAVE THEIR VOICE. JOE HAS STOOD THERE THROUGH THE YEARS FOR ALL OF US IN LEGISLATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN GET HEARD, GET SEEN, GET BELIEVED. NEXT THING THAT JOE DID THAT WAS VERY LIFE CHANGING FOR SO MANY IN THIS ROOM AND FOR OTHERS IS THAT HE WORKED SO HARD ON THAT AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. HE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT HOW SICKNESS AFFECTS FAMILIES AND ABOUT LOSS. AND HE HEARD THESE STORIES FROM HIS OWN COMMUNITY AND AREA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I WAS THERE WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND IT WAS A HARD PULL. AND WE WANT TO THINK ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET THIS DONE? NOT JOE BIDEN. JOE STAYED ON IT BECAUSE HE KNEW AMERICANS NEEDED TO HAVE THIS SO HE WAS THERE AND I WAS PRIVILEGED BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORKED ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE IN THE HOUSE AND TO WATCH HIS PLACE AND WE HAD CHILDREN WHOSE LIVES CHANGED FOR THE BETTER IN THE ROOM WITH US AND TO WATCH JOE BIDEN'S FACE WAS TO KNOW EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT JOE BIDEN THAT HE WAS THERE FROM THE BEGINNING AND UNDERSTANDING AND CARING AND MAKING SURE IT HAPPENED AND WORKING WITH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WENT THROUGH. I SPENT ALMOST NINE YEARS ON THE HOUSE SERVICES COMMITTEE AND DURING THAT TIME, I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF TRAVELING AROUND THE WORLD AND TALKING TO WORLD LEADERS AS WE DO, CONGRESSIONAL AND HEARING WHAT WAS ON THEIR MIND AND THEIR WORRIES AND CONCERNS IN TALKING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES AND OUR ROLE, AS WELL. AND IT WAS SO WONDERFUL, ALWAYS JOEJOE BIDEN'S NAME BROUGHT THE GREATEST RESPONSE, KNOWING THAT JOE BIDEN CARED ABOUT OUR ALLIES AND CARED ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD. WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS OUTRAGEOUS, FRIGHTENING, DEVASTATING IN EVERY WAY. WHEN JOE BIDEN BECOMES PRESIDENT WHAT WE WILL SEE IS SOMEBODY A WORLD LEADER WELCOMED ON THE STAGE, HE ALREADY IS IF YOU HEAR COMMENTS THAT PEOPLE MAKE ABROAD, YOU WOULD KNOW HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT HIM. HE'LL BE ABLE TO TURN THIS AROUND AND HE'LL BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT THIS IS JUST A MOMENT IN HISTORY THAT WE ARE FAR BETTER THAN WHAT WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW AND THAT WE'RE STILL THE GREATEST, STRONGEST NATION IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] THIS MATTERS. [APPLAUSE] THIS MATTERS GREAT SO HAVING TRAVELED WHILE WE SAW JOE BIDEN AS VICE PRESIDENT AND HAVING TRAVELED WHILE I WAS SERVING AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS IN THE OFFICE, THE DIFFERENCE COULD NOT BE STARKER SO I'M ASKING ALL OF YOU TO PLEASE GO OUT AND TELL ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ELECT A MAN THAT HAS THE GREATEST RESPECT AROUND THE WORLD AND THAT HE WILL BRING US BACK TO THE POINT WHERE WE REALLY ARE THE SHINING CITY ON THE HILL. SO I'M READY, ARE YOU READY? [APPLAUSE] IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE NOW TO INTRODUCE IT, BECAUSE JOE BIDEN SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AS YOU KNOW, LOVES US. I WILL TELL YOU VERY QUICKLY THAT WHEN I WAS IN PORTSMOUTH, I HAD LUNCH WITH JOE BIDEN AND 5,000 PEOPLE FROM PORTSMOUTH. IT WAS A WONDERFUL, WARM EXPERIENCE AND THAT IS WHO JOE BIDEN IS. JOE BIDEN IS YOUR FRIEND, JOE BIDEN IS YOUR LEADER, JOE BIDEN IS A MAN WHO WILL MAKE US FEEL PROUD EVERY SINGLE DAY AND MAKE US FEEL SAFE. SO IN THAT, IT'S MY GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] A LOT OF YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN PUBLIC LIFE, SOME OF YOU HAVE RUN, SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN ELECTED. A LOT OF YOU HAVE WORKED FOR OTHER CANDIDATES. I MUST TELL YOU AS I LISTEN TO HER TALK, ONE OF THE GREAT, GREAT BENEFITS THAT COMES FROM SERVING IN PUBLIC OFFICE AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY, I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT UNTIL I STARTED TO LISTEN HERE IS THAT YOU GET TO MAKE SOME OF THE DEEPEST, MOST PROFOUND FRIENDSHIPS IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE. BECAUSE YOU WATCH PEOPLE GOING THROUGH GREAT DIFFICULTY. YOU WATCH THEM TAKING POLITICAL RISKS TO DO WHAT THEY THINK IS RIGHT. AND YOU CAN FIND THE ONES WHO ALWAYS ARE GUIDED BY BASIC MORALITY, BASIC DECENCY AND BASIC SENSE OF HONOR AND CAROL, YOU'RE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] AND THE FELLOW YOU HEARD FROM EARLIER HAS GONE WAY OUT OF HIS WAY TO BE HELPFUL TO ME. SENATOR CHRIS KUNTZ IS NOW , NOW OCCUPIES THE SEAT THAT I HELD FOR MANY YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS IN THE SEVERAL YEARS HE'S OUTDONE BY 36 AND I'M PROUD OF HIM. THIS IS A MAN WHO AGAIN, HAS A MORAL CENTER THAT IS REAL, PROFOUND AND DEEP. AND I REMEMBER YEARS AGO TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE HAD OTHER JOBS, HE'S BEEN ELECTED TO OTHER OFFICES AND I WAS , BECAUSE WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED, I WAS ELECTED AT AGE 29. AND PEOPLE WOULD COME UP TO ME AND SAY WHAT'S THE SECRET? THERE HAD TO BE A SPECIAL SECRET IF I WON. AND I WOULD SAY THERE'S ONE THE SECRET IS HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT'S WORTH LOSING OVER? HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT IS WORTH LOSING OVER? THAT YOU WILL NOT COMPROMISE ON CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE DEEP, ABIDING CONSEQUENCES TO YOU? HE FIGURED OUT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM ME WHAT'S WORTH LOSING OVER AND THEREFORE, THAT'S WHY HE'S WON SO HANDILY IN DELAWARE. CHRIS, THANKS FOR BEING MY FRIEND. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I HAVE A FAIRLY SERIOUS SERIES OF COMMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. THIS STATE WAS BUILT ON FIERCE PRIDE IN YOUR INDEPENDENCE, PRIDE IN YOUR REPUTATION, AND PRIDE IN THE CHARACTER OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. AND THAT'S BEEN TRUE FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF OUR NATION WHEN LIVE FREE OR DIE WASN'T A MOTTO, IT WAS AN IMPERATIVE FOR SURVIVAL BEFORE IT BECAME YOUR STATE'S MOTTO, SAYING. IT SPRUNG FROM THE GRANITE-HAND DETERMINATION THAT NO ONE, NO ONE WOULD DECIDE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO, WHO WOULD CONTROL OUR FUTURE. ONLY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND WHEN THOSE FREEDOM FIGHTERS EARNED THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND COBBLED TOGETHER A NATION CAPABLE OF SELF-GOVERNANCE, OF MEETING THREATS BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, THEY KNEW AND WE FORGET THIS SOMETIMES, THEY KNEW THAT THE BATTLE FOR OUR NATION DIDN'T END AT YORKTOWN. AT THE TIME, ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS WAS FOREIGN NATIONS WOULD INTERFERE IN OUR DEMOCRACY, IN OUR EXPERIMENT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AN EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE TO PREVENT PRESIDENTS FROM BEING SECRETLY BRIBED OR PAID OFF BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. IN HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS, GEORGE WASHINGTON SPECIFICALLY WARNED AGAINST FOREIGN NATIONS MEDDLING IN OUR AFFAIRS. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. SINCE HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE PROVE THAT FOREIGN INFLUENCE IS ONE OF THE MOST BANEFUL, ONE OF THE MOST BANEFUL FOES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE TO BE ALERT. OVER 200 YEARS PLUS HAS FOLLOWED AND WE HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN OUR VIGILANCE TO KEEP FOREIGN NATIONS OUT OF OUR ELECTIONS. THAT WAS UNTIL PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. LAST WEEK, ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN, PRESIDENT TRUMP INVITED CHINA TO GET ENGAGED IN DECIDING OUR ELECTION AND WHO OUR NOMINEE WOULD BE. HE DID IT WHILE STANDING IN FRONT OF REPORTERS AND CAMERAS LIKE I AM THIS MOMENT, IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF DAY. IT WAS A THIRD FOREIGN POWER THAT WE KNOW OF, THAT HE'S ASKED IN CLEAR, UNMISTAKABLE LANGUAGE, CLEAR, UNMISTAKABLE LANGUAGE, TO INTERFERE ON BEHALF OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCEEDINGS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, INTERFERE WITH THEM. QUOTE, RUSSIA, IF YOU'RE LISTENING, OR QUOTE, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO US A FAVORITE, THOUGH, END OF QUOTE TO THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE. QUOTE, CHINA SHOULD START INVESTIGATION, END OF QUOTE. IT'S WRONG. IT'S THE VERY THING WASHINGTON WARNED ABOUT. IT UNDERMINES OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS. IT'S UN-AMERICAN. GO IN ANY CITY OR TOWN IN THIS NATION OR STATE. GO IN ANY SCHOOLHOUSE, GO INTO ANY TOWN HALL, ANY VFW POST, ANY FOOTBALL OR BASEBALL GAME AND ASK THE QUESTION, IS IT OKAY FOR A FOREIGN NATION TO MEDDLE IN OUR ELECTIONS? TO SPREAD LIES ABOUT OPPONENTS? SPECIFICALLY AT THE DIRECT INVITATION OF A SITTING PRESIDENT? THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUSLY, NO. AS AMERICANS IT OFFENDS EVERY BONE IN OUR BODY. THE BALLOT BOX IS SACRED GROUND IN AMERICA. THAT'S WHERE WE MAKE OUR VOICES HEARD. THAT'S WHERE WE DECIDE WHO LEADS US. THAT'S WHERE WE CHART AMERICA'S FUTURE. IT'S WHERE WE FULFILL OUR DUTY AS CITIZENS. IT'S NOT COMPLICATED. IT'S CALLED DEMOCRACY. WE BELIEVE AMERICANS SHOULD DECIDE AMERICAN ELECTIONS, PERIOD. BUT DONALD TRUMP WILL DO ANYTHING TO GET REELECTED, INCLUDING VIOLATING THE MOST BASIC FORMS OF DEMOCRACY. IT'S STUNNING. AND IT'S DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY THREATENS OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS IS NOT HYPERBOLE. IT'S A FACT. NO PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAS EVER DARED TO ENGAGE IN SUCH UNIMAGINABLE BEHAVIOR. WITH HIS WORDS AND HIS ACTIONS, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS INDICTED HIMSELF BY OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE, REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY. HE'S ALREADY CONVICTED HIMSELF IN FULL VIEW OF THE WORLD AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. DONALD TRUMP HAS VIOLATED HIS OATH OF OFFICE, BETRAYED THIS NATION AND COMMITTED IN PEACHABLE ACTS. [APPLAUSE] TO PRESERVE OUR CONSTITUTION, OUR DEMOCRACY, OUR BASIC INTEGRITY, HE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED. THAT'S NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF WHAT HE'S DONE. TO ANSWER WHETHER HE'S COMMITTED ACTS SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT IMPEACHMENT IS OBVIOUS. WE SEE IT IN TRUMP'S OWN WORDS, WE SEE IT IN THE TEXTS FROM STATE COMPARTMENT OFFICIALS THAT HAD BEEN MADE PUBLIC. WE SEE IT IN HIS PULLING MUCH OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT INTO HIS CORRUPT SCHEMES, INDIVIDUALS, HIS APPOINTEES. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IMPEACHMENT ISN'T ONLY ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S DONE. IT'S ABOUT THE THREAT THE PRESIDENT POSED TO THE NATION. IF ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN OFFICE. ONE THING ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN CONTRADICT HE IS SEEING NO LIMITS TO HIS POWER REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE CONSTITUTION SAYS. HE BELIEVES THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT CAN BE CORRUPTED INTO FURTHERING HIS PERSONAL, POLITICAL NEEDS. HE'S EVEN WILLING TO HOLD CONGRESS AND AID TO A FOREIGN NATION HOSTAGE TO PERSON POLITICAL DEMANDS. HE BELIEVES IF HE DOES SOMETHING, IT'S LEGAL, PERIOD. AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY HE BELIEVES THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. HE BELIEVES HE CAN AND WILL GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING HE DOES. WE ALL LAUGHED WHEN HE SAID HE COULD STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF FIFTH AVENUE AND SHOOT SOMEONE AND GET AWAY WITH IT. IT'S NO JOKE. HE'S SHOOTING HOLES IN THE CONSTITUTION. AND WE CANNOT LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT. [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD HAVE NO ILLUSIONS. THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO HAS DECIDED THAT THIS NATION DOESN'T HAVE THE TOOLS OR THE POWER OR THE POLITICAL WILL TO STOP FIM FROM DOING WHATEVER HE WANTS. TRUMP ISN'T JUST TESTING US, HE'S LAUGHING AT US. HE HAS NO SENSE OF DECENCY. HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE LAW. HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS THAT FOLLOW THE RULES ARE ANYTHING OTHER THAN SUCKERS OR FOOLS OR LOSERS. WE HAVE TO PROVE HIM WRONG. WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR CONSTITUTION, OUR GOVERNMENT, OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS, INCLUDING REPUBLICANS ARE UP TO THIS MOMENT AND YOU SEE THE, ESPECIALLY A DANGEROUS MOMENT FOR THIS NATION BECAUSE WE KNOW THE PRESSURE ON TRUMP IS ONLY GOING TO INCREASE. AND WHEN THAT PRESSURE INCREASES HE'S ONLY GOING TO GROW MORE VOLATILE, MORE SELF-SERVING AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE. HE HAS ANOTHER YEAR IN OFFICE. NO, I'M SERIOUS, THINK ABOUT THAT. THINK ABOUT THAT. HE'LL STOP AT NOTHING TO SAVE HIMSELF. NO INDIVIDUAL, NO INSTITUTION, NOTHING, NOTHING THAT WE'VE HELD NATIONSACRED IN THIS NATION MORE THAN 200 YEARS WILL BE SAFE. IF DONALD TRUMP WAS JUST A REALITY TV STAR IT WOULDN'T MATTER, BUT HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. HE'S COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. WITH THE FREE WORLD UNDER THREAT OF ADVANCING AUTHORITARIANISM, HE HAS EMBRACED THOSE AUTOCRATS AND THE TIME CHINA IS ENGAGED IN HUMAN RIGHTS BUTCHES THAT ARE STAGGERING, MORE THAN 100 MUSLIMS ARE IMPRISONED IN SO-CALLED REEDUCATION CAMPS IN THE WEST. IN HONG KONG, PROTESTERS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING MET WITH VIOLENT REPRESSION AS THEY DEMAND THE DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS THEY WERE PROMISED. THEY WERE GUARANTEED BY US AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. DOES HE SPEAK OUT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND STAND FOR THE PEOPLE IN HONG KONG? OR THE PEOPLE IN REEDUCATION CAMP? NO. HE PROMISED TO STAY SILENT. TRUMP AND HIS EMISSARIES HAVE SOUGHT REPEATEDLY TO EXTORT THE EXISTENTIAL FEARS OF UKRAINIAN LEADERS FOR POLITICAL ADVANTAGE, HOLDING UP POLITICAL SUPPORT OF VITALLY NEEDED MILITARY AID TO PRESSURE UKRAINE AT A TIME WHEN IT'S ENGAGED IN A LIVE WAR WITH RUSSIA. MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IN THE WEST THERE'S A WAR GOING ON NOW. A WAR THAT'S COSTING THOUSANDS OF UKRAINIAN LIVES. THIS ISN'T A GAME. IT'S DEADLY SERIOUS. THE UNITED STATES CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL ABUSE WHATEVER POWER IS AVAILABLE TO HIM TO GET REELECTED. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT AND HERE'S THE KICKER. THE PEOPLE AROUND THE PRESIDENT KNEW THAT WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS WRONG, PROFOUNDLY WRONG. WHAT DID THEY TRY TO DO? THEY TRIED TO COVER IT UP BY HIDING THE EVIDENCE, CLASSIFYING IT LIKE NO OTHER PRESIDENT HAS HAD TO CLASSIFY THESE CONVERSATIONS. WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT THIS THANKS TO THE COURAGEOUS ACTIONS OF A WHISTLEBLOWER WHO HAS BEEN JOINED BY OTHERS STEPPING UP TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY. TRUMP'S SCHEME HAS BEEN EXPOSED. LOOK, FOLKS, TRUMP DID IT BECAUSE, LIKE EVERY BULLY I'VE EVER KNOWN AND EVERY BULLY WE'VE READ ABOUT IN HISTORY, HE'S BASICALLY A COWARD, HE'S AFRAID. HE'S AFRAID. [APPLAUSE] HE'S AFRAID ABOUT HOW BADLY I WILL BEAT HIM NEXT NOVEMBER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, HE'S TARGETED ME AND MY FAMILY WITH LIES AND DISTORTIONS AND SMEARS. THAT'S ONLY , HE THINKS HE WILL UNDERMINE MY CANDIDACY FOR THE NOMINATION AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENCY IF I'M THE NOMINEE. HE'S JUST FLAT DOING WHAT HE'S ALWAYS DONE: LYING. EVEN THOUGH THE MAIN STREAM HAS CALLED HIM OUT FOR HIS LIES, WHILE THE PRESIDENT TRUMP INTERRUPTED HIM SAYING HE'S LYING? MAYBE. I DON'T REMEMBER. AND HE'S SPENDING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ISEARLY IN THE CAMPAIGN TO ENGAGE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY TO SPREAD LIES. HE'S TRYING TO ORCHESTRATE A CAMPAIGN WHERE TRUTH AND THE FACTS ARE IRRELEVANT. YOU SAY IT LONG ENOUGH, OFTEN ENOUGH, PEOPLE MAY BELIEVE IT. AND HE'S LYING IS MATCHED ONLY BY HIS MANIFEST INCOMPETENCE. [APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE AT THE OUTSET OF MY ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO LEVEL TO WHICH HE WILL NOT STOOP. HE'S INSINUATED THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPOKEN TO THE WHISTLEBLOWER SHOULD BE EXECUTED. HERE'S WHAT TRUMP SAID IN THE CLOSED DOOR MEETING WITH U.S. DIPLOMATS, QUOTE: I WANT TO KNOW WHO'S THE PERSON? WHO'S THE PERSON WHO GAVE THE WHISTLEBLOWER THE INFORMATION? BECAUSE THAT'S CLOSE TO A SPY, I'M STILL GOING QUOTING. YOU KNOW WHAT WE USED TO IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN WE WERE SMART, RIGHT? AND I'M STILL GOING QUOTING, RIGHT? SPIES ANDTREASON, WE USED TO HANDLE IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO NOW. WHAT PRESIDENT HAS EVER USED SUCH LANGUAGE? THINK ABOUT THIS: WHAT PRESIDENT HAS EVER USED SUCH LANGUAGE? AND NOW, ALLEGEDLY I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT THE WHISTLEBLOWERS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR SAFETY, THANKS TO OUR PRESIDENT? IT IS SHAMEFUL. HE HAS NO SHAME, THOUGH. TRUMP EVEN DARED TO SAY IF HE'S REMOVED FROM OFFICE, QUOTE, I'M NOT POSITIVE OF THE QUOTE. I'LL BE VERY PRECISE. THAT IT WILL SPARK A CIVIL WAR. [INAUDIBLE] RIGHT WING MEDIA OUTLETS ARE FULL OF BASELESS CONSPIRACY THEORIES, IN THE DARKEST REACHES OF THE INTERNET RUWASH WITH THOSE VILE ATTACKS AND HE'S SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW, OF CAMPAIGN MONEY FROM SPECIAL ENTER B GROUPS WHO HATE ME AND MOST DEMOCRATS TO SPREAD HIS LIES. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE, THEY'RE LIES. THERE'S NO TRUTH IN HIS CHARGES, IN THE ATTACKS AGAINST ME AND MY SON, ZERO. EVERY INDEPENDENT NEWS ORGANIZATION THAT'S REVIEWED HIS CHARGES AT LENGTH FOUND THEM TO BE FLAT OUT LIES. AND TRUMP KNOWS IT. BUT THE OLD METHOD HE HAS USED VERY WELL SINCE HE WAS A BUSINESSMAN, REPEAT, REPEAT, REPEAT THE LIE. MY INSISTENCE THAT A PROSECUTOR WHO WAS VIEWED AS CORRUPT BE REPLACED WAS THE OFFICIAL POSITION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED BY REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO SENT A LETTER, SENT A LETTER IN 2016 CALLING FOR THE REMOVAL BECAUSE OF CORRUPTION. SUPPORTED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND. OUR ALLIES, INCLUDING THE U.K., FRANCE, GERMANY. WHAT TRUMP DID IN UKRAINE WAS TO CARRY OUT A SECRET POLICY FOR HIS ON PERSONAL POLITICAL BENEFIT AND HOPE THAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO FACE ME AND MY GUESS IS ANYONE ELSE WHO HE THOUGHT WAS LIKELY TO WIN. WHAT I DID WAS TO SEEK TO REPLACE A WEAK PROSECUTOR WITH ONE WHO WE HELPED WOULD GO AFTER CORRUPTION THAT WAS HOLDING UKRAINE BACK. THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS THREATENING NOT TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT UKRAINE, UNLESS THEY DEALT WITH THE CORRUPTION. WHAT TRUMP DID WAS HOLD HOSTAGE POLITICAL SUPPORT AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DESPERATELY NEEDED DOLLARS TO A COUNTRY AT WAR TO ADVANCE HIS OWN POLITICAL DEMANDS. IF IT HAD BEEN WRITTEN AS A SITCOM, IT WOULDN'T BE BELIEVED. THINK ABOUT THIS. AND NOW, THERE'S A REPORT THAT NOBBLE DID TRUMP SEND RUDY GIULIANI, A MAN OF GREAT INTEGRITY , [AUDIENCE REACTS] HIS PERSONAL LAWYER, TO CARRY OUT HIS SCHEME AND CO-OPT THE STAGE, THAT THE ALLIES OF GIULIANI WERE WORKING HIM A SIDE DEAL AT THE SAME TIME TO MAKE MILLIONS OF UKRAINE. JUST ALLEGED, I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT. A CORRUPT SCHEME WITH THE ADDITIONAL HELPING OF CORRUPTION AND SELF-DEALING ON THE SIDE. CLASSIC TRUMP. LOOK, THE ABUSE OF POWER IS A DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC OF TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. HE ACTS, HE REACTS, HE TWISTS, HE TURNS ACCORDING TO WHAT HE THINKS IS GOOD FOR HIM. FOR HIS EGO. FOR PERSONAL POLITICS, FOR CAMPAIGN MONEY. VIRTUALLY EVERY DAY HE LAUNCHES A BARRAGE OF TWEETS TO DISPARAGE, THREATEN, ANYONE WHO NOT ONLY DOESN'T CRITICIZE HIM, BUT DOESN'T BATHE HIM IN PRAISE. THINK ABOUT IT. YOU EVER BEEN TO A CABINET MEETING WHERE THEY SAY YES, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'RE THE GREATEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. THINK ABOUT IT. WE'VE BECOME SO INURED BY THIS RIDICULOUSNESS. ANYONE WHO CHALLENGES HIS OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR, BEHAVIOR THAT'S BENEATH ANY PRESIDENT AT ANY TIME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THINK ABOUT THE WAY HE TWEETS AND TALKS ABOUT WOMEN OF COLOR. WHO DARE TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS AGAINST HIM AND HAPPEN TO BE SITTING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. THINK ABOUT THE WAY HE TURNED ON THE FBI AND AMERICA'S INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WHO WERE JUST POINTING OUT TO HIM THAT RUSSIA AND PUTIN WERE DIRECTLY ENGAGING AND TRYING TO DEAL WITH OUR SOVEREIGNTY BY ENGAGING IN OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS. NOBODY, NOBODY DOUBTS IT. AND ON THE WORLD STAGE HE DISSED THEM AND SAID I BELIEVE PUTIN. HE'S REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED HIS DESIRE TO ADVANCE HIS OWN PERSONAL GAIN AHEAD OF THE PUBLIC GOOD. AND HE'S READY TO DO ANYTHING IT TAKES TO STAY IN POWER, TO PROTECT HIMSELF, BECAUSE WHEN HE'S OUT OF POWER HE MAY BE A LOT MORE VULNERABLE. WE NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING. THIS ISN'T JUST AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE AND POLITICAL THEORY. A PRESIDENT WHO PUTS HIS OWN SELF-INTEREST AHEAD OF THE PUBLIC GOOD AND NATIONAL SECURITY ALSO POSES A THREAT TO EACH AND EVERY AMERICAN IN OUR DAILY LIVES. HE'S ALREADY THREATENED THE WHISTLEBLOWER AND ANYONE WHO TALKS TO THE WHISTLEBLOWER. NOW, ADDITIONAL WHISTLEBLOWERS ARE COMING FORWARD. I DON'T KNOW IT FOR A FACT, I JUST KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW. SOME WITH INFORMATION ABOUT HOW HE WAS PRESSURING UKRAINE. OTHERS ABOUT PRESSURE HE MAY HAVE PUT ON THE IRS ABOUT HIS TAXES. AND BY THE WAY, EVEN THOUGH NIXON RELEASED HIS TAXES. [APPLAUSE] WHERE ARE HIS TAXES? WHAT'S BURIED IN THOSE RETURNS. WHY CAN'T THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY THEM? WHY CAN'T HE RELEASE THEM? [APPLAUSE] WELL, HE'S PROVEN HE'LL USE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AGAINST ANYONE HE BELIEVES THREATENS HIS POWER, HIS ABILITY TO STAY IN OFFICE. NOW, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS INTERVENTION ON TRUMP'S BEHALF IN HIS PERSONAL LAWSUIT TO HIDE HIS FINANCES FROM THE PUBLIC EYE. TRUMP HAS PROVEN THAT HE'LL USE THE STATE DEPARTMENT AGAINST ANYONE WHO BELIEVES, HE BELIEVES THREATENS HIS POWER OR HIS ABILITY TO STAY IN OFFICE. HE WILL ORDER THE REMOVAL OF CAREER DIPLOMATS WHO WON'T CARRY OUT HIS WHIMS WITHOUT QUESTION. DOES ANYONE DOUBT HE WOULD USE ANY OTHER PART OF THE GOVERNMENT, ANY OTHER POWER AVAILABLE TO HIM AS PRESIDENT TO DESTROY ANYONE? HE BELIEVES THREATENS HIS ABILITY TO STAY IN POWER AND STAY BEHIND THE VEIL? THE ABILITY TO STAY IN OFFICE? WHEN I ANNOUNCED MY CANDIDACY, AND I DID IT HERE AS WELL, I SAID I WAS RUNNING IN ORDER TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA. IT WAS NOT HYPERBOLE AND IT WASN'T JUST WHAT WE SAW IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA, PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE WOODS AND FIELDS CARRYING TORCHES, CHANTING ANTISEMITIC BILE ACCOMPANIED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND KU KLUX KLAN. IT'S BEEN REPEATED AND REPEATED AND REPEATED. SO FOLKS, RESTORING THE SOUL OF AMERICA, THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE IN 2020. THAT'S WHY THIS ELECTION IS SO IMPORTANT. IT'S WHY WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET DONALD TRUMP TAKE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT PERIOD. I'M NOT GOING TO LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT. HE'S PICKED THE A FIGHT WITH THE WRONG GUY. [APPLAUSE] I'M NOT GOING TO BE DISTRACTED BY ALL HIS LIES AND SMEARS AND DISTORTION. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. THEY KNOW ME, AS WELL. NONE OF THESE ATTACKS ARE TRUE AND I'M GOING TO STAY FOCUSED ON YOUR LIVES. THAT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT.. IT'S ABOUT YOUR FAMILIES, YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR GRANDCHILDREN AND YOU CAN'T WAIT, YOU CAN'T WAIT FOR AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. YOU CAN'T WAIT TO GET PAID A DECENT WAGE IN A JOB YOU HAVE. YOU CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE ACCESS TO EDUCATION. YOU CAN'T WAIT FOR US TO DO SOMETHING RATIONAL ABOUT GUNS. YOU CAN'T WAIT FOR US TO TAKE ON WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR CLIMATE AND THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE WORLD. IT CAN'T WAIT. [APPLAUSE] AND THE WORLD CAN'T WAIT FOR AMERICA TO LEAD A STABLE, PEACEFUL INTERNATIONAL ORDER. WITHOUT ONCE WE'RE ALL IN TROUBLE. THE WORLD IS IN TROUBLE. I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN LIKE JFK SAID WHEN HE SPOKE ABOUT TAKING AMERICA TO THE MOON. HE SAID I AM WILLING TO POSTPONE THE WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE FOR YOU, FOR AMERICA, OUR POSSIBILITIES ARE LIMITLESS, BUT IT TAKES VISION AND YES, IT TAKES PLANS, BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. IT TAKES A PROVEN ABILITY TO GET BIG THINGS DONE. AND NO ONE IN THIS RACE HAS HAD A STRONGER RECORD OF PASSING IMPORTANT, CONSEQUENTIAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAN I HAVE OR PROMOTING THEM WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT FROM THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT RENEWLING TO THE BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS, TO THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, TO OBAMACARE TO THE RECOVERY ACT WHICH KEPT US FROM SLIDING INTO A DEPRESSION. I'VE BEEN THERE. I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THESE THINGS DONE. SO LET ME FINISH WITH THIS. A LOT OF MY PRIMARY OPPONENTS AND THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO DO MORE THAN JUST DEFEAT TRUMP. I AGREE. WE HAVE TO DO MORE THAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE TO BEAT HIM LIKE A DRUM. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.

THANK YOU. I HAVE TO TELL YOU SHE WRITES ABOUT SHE IS SERIOUS AND MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME AT THAT TIME SHE WOULD ENDORSE ME. I MEAN THAT SINCERELY. IT MEANS A LOT. AND I HAVE A GREAT, GREAT FRIEND THAT WE KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ONE ANOTHER WE LOST ONE OF OUR GOOD FRIENDS WHO PASSED AWAY BUT JIM IS SOMEWHERE IN HERE. [APPLAUSE] AND YOUR MAYOR I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS TO BE INVOLVED IN POLITICS FOR A WHILE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS A GREAT HONOR OF REPETITION OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AS YOU GO ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT YOU END UP IN THE PROCESS MAKING FRIENDS FOR LIFE. NO MATTER IF YOU WIN OR LOSE HER WHAT HAPPENED TO BECOME FRIENDS FOR LIFE. SO THE FOLKS THAT I JUST NAME THEY ARE FRIENDS SHE ALSO LOST HER HUSBAND AND I LOST MY SON BUT WE CARED WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO THE OTHER PERSON. NOT JUST TO OURSELVES. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM APPOINTED PERSONAL PRIVILEGE WERE SO GOOD TO MY SONS. AND HUMAN BRACED HIM. AND MENTIONING A GENTLEMAN'S NAME THE GOOD GUY I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM IN A LONG TIME AND HE SAID I WOULD RATHER HAVE VOTED FOR YOUR SON BUT I WILL VOTE FOR YOU. MY DAD SAID WHEN YOU TURN TO LOOK AT YOUR CHILD AND REALIZE THEY TURNED OUT BETTER THAN YOU. THE WAY YOU EMBRACED MY SON AND ME WHEN THINGS HAPPENED , THAT MEANS A LOT. I SEE SO MANY FAMILIAR FACES. AND YOU HAVE CINDY HER LUNG CASHIER ESTATE REPRESENTATIVE AND FOR HER TO BE HERE AND OF ALL THE ROLES THE UNITED STATES HAS TO FILL, THERE WAS ONE THAT IS MORE CONSEQUENTIAL THAN ANY OTHER. THAT'S TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES OF THE COMMANDER OF UNITED STATES MILITARY. IT IS A SACRED DUTY AND NOT SOMETHING THAT IS DONE OR LOOKED AT. SO I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I MAKE A SERIOUS SPEECH THAT WILL TAKE ABOUT 25 MINUTES ABOUT AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AND WHY I AM SO CONCERNED ABOUT OUR SECURITY AND THE CLIMATE OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. THE POWER TO DEPLOY THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, NEVER BEEN MORE CONFIDENT WARRIORS OR A MORE CONFIDENT MILITARY THAN WHAT WE HAVE. IT IS NOT AN EGO BOOSTER OR RATINGS BOOSTER. YOU TAKE THE YACHT OATH OF OFFICE TO SWEAR RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR TROOPS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE ONLY SACRED OBLIGATION WE HAVE IS TO PROTECT THOSE WE SEND TO WAR TO CARE FOR THEM WHEN THEY COME HOME AND THEIR FAMILIES WHEN THEY ARE GONE. THEY RISK THEIR LIVES SO THEIR GOVERNMENT CAN WORK. ANOTHER RESPONSIBILITY IS THAT WHEN A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IT'S FOR AN OVERWHELMING NATIONAL SECURITY PURPOSE. AND ALSO DRIVE RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR ALLIES AND TO OUR PARTNERS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL STAND BEHIND ITS WORD AND STAND WITH OUR ALLIES IN TIMES OF NEED. OUR ADVERSARIES KNOW THE UNITED STATES SEEKS PEACE THAT WILL NOT HESITATE TO DEFEND OUR NATIONAL INTEREST OR THE INTEREST OF THOSE WE HAVE SWORN SACRED ALLIANCES. DONALD TRUMP I BELIEVE, I'M UNCOMFORTABLE TO SAY THIS ABOUT A PRESIDENT, BUT HE IS A COMPLETE FAILURE IS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. IS MOST WRECK ONE - - RECKLESS AND INCOMPETENT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WE HAVE EVER HAD. AND HE FAILS REPEATEDLY. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. HE IS JUST INCOMPETENT. I MEAN IT. HE HAS IMPULSES AND THEY ARE IMPULSES THAT HE HAS. AND THEN WHEN THE UNPREDICTABLE HAPPENS HE'S NOT PREPARED AND IT'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULT. IT NEVER STOPS AT HIS DESK. TALKS ARE BASED ON NOTHING MORE THAN A DELUSIONAL PROMISE BY A BLOODIED DICTATOR. CAUSING HUGE PAIN INCLUDING HERE IN IOWA 160 WORKERS LAID OFF HERE IN THE QUAD CITIES WITH JOHN DEERE NOT TO MENTION THE PAIN IT HAS CAUSED TO MANUFACTURING. SO VIRTUALLY NO GAIN AT ALL IN THE STRATEGY. IRAN IS GROWING MORE AND MORE PROVOCATIVE. STARTING THIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP CHOSE TO RENEGE ON A DIPLOMATIC AGREEMENT ON THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS WORKING WITH THE REGIME TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THAT EVER OCCURRED IN MODERN HISTORY. AND NOW TURKISH FORCES ARE INVADING WITH OUR KURDISH ALLIES AND PARTNERS BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP TWEETED THEIR WITHDRAWAL. ACCORDING TO THE ADMIRAL , FORMER HEAD OF NAVAL OPERATIONS AND WITHOUT ANY NOTIFICATION TO THE MILITARY. THEN TO HAVE CLARITY. TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD TO THE BRAVE WOMEN AND MEN SERVING IN UNIFORM. BUILDING AND MAINTAINING FOR OUR ALLIES IS A CRITICAL ELEMENT A DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC. SINCE WORLD WAR II. A SMALL NUMBER OF AMERICA SPECIAL FORCES IN SYRIA, TRUMP MANAGED IN ONE FELL SWOOP HELP TO FEED ISIS, CREATE A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE 160,000 NEWLY DISPLACED PERSONS RUN OUT OF THEIR HOMES. FORCING OUR TROOPS TO RETREAT. THEY ARE IN RETREAT. THE UNITED STATES MILITARY IS IN RETREAT FROM TURKEY. RUSSIA AND THE MURDEROUS ASIDE REGIME IS MOVING IN TO FILL THE VACUUM. ISIS, FORMERLY AL QAEDA HAS A NEW LEASE ON LIFE BY FORCING THE KURDS TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT ISIS AND HOLD THOSE PRISONERS THAT THEY HAVE AND TRY TO PROTECT THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS AND FAMILIES. INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THE REMNANTS OF THE CALIPHATE ISIS HAS SET UP 10000 ISIS TERRORISTS. SOME OF WHOM HAVE ALREADY ESCAPED. AND WITH GLOBAL CONFIDENCE AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN A COMPLETE FREE-FOR-ALL. IF YOU SAY SOMETHING VERY SELF-SERVING THIS IS SOMETHING I KNOW A LOT ABOUT I SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THAT AREA I HAVE BEEN ENGAGED BECAUSE THAT WAS MY JOB AS CHAIRMAN OF FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND DOING MAJOR NATIONAL SECURITY FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA. ALL THE CONSEQUENCES I HAVE MENTIONED, EVERY SINGLE ONE CAN BE LAID AT THE FEET OF DONALD TRUMP. HE GREENLIGHTED TURKEY'S INVASION. NOW HE IS LEFT ASKING TURKEY TO STOP IT. THAT THE DAMAGE IS DONE. YOU DON'T GET A DO OVER WITH NATIONAL SECURITY. THE DECISIONS HAVE DEADLY AND SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. BUT YET THE DYNAMICS OF SYRIA ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED. AND YES THE CONFLICT BETWEEN TURKEY AND THE KURDS GOES BACK DECADES BUT BEFORE TRUMP'S TWEET A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF US FORCES WORKING TOGETHER WITH OUR KURDISH PARTNERS WAS ACTUALLY KEEPING NORTHERN IRAQ RELATIVELY STABLE. PEOPLE WERE NOT DYING THEY WERE KEEPING THE PRESSURE ON WHAT WAS LEFT OF ISIS. NOW THEY BEEN BLOWN APART. IMAGINE HOW DEMORALIZING THAT IS TO OUR TROOPS AS RUSSIA POURS IN MERCENARIES TAKING VICTORY LAPS INSIDE US CAMPS AND FACILITIES. IN THE PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED THEM TO ABANDON. IN TURKEY ATTACKING THE VERY PEOPLE THEY FOUGHT ALONGSIDE OF. THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOMEBODY IN THE OVAL OFFICE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE GRAVITY OF THEIR DECISIONS. IS GREAT UNMATCHED WISDOM\"MY GOD WHAT A DELUSIONAL MAN. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] THAT GREAT UNMATCHED WISDOM WITH THAT PROGRESS ACROSS TO ADMINISTRATIONS SO AS A RETIRED ADMIRAL EVERYONE WAS FLABBERGASTED. IN THE PENTAGON AND THROUGHOUT. OUR MILITARY DID NOT SIGN ON TO THIS. THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT MUSTERS ENOUGH BACKBONE TO CRITICIZE HIM ON. [APPLAUSE] THAT SOUNDS OUTRAGEOUS AS IT IS EVEN MITCH MCCONNELL KNOWS HE IS WRONG. [LAUGHTER] THINK ABOUT IT. LINDSEY GRAHAM IS NOW BEING ATTACKED BY TRUMP AGAIN. TRUMP TRY TO JUSTIFY HIS DECISION TO ABANDON THE KURDS BY MAKING THE ABSOLUTE RIDICULOUS UNINFORMED CRAZY COMMENT THEY DIDN'T HELP US IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR. [LAUGHTER] THEY DIDN'T HELP US IN NORMANDIE. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? WHAT A GLOBAL EMBARRASSMENT. GUESS WHAT? A DIRECT THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN DURING WORLD WAR II. BUT SOME OF IT HAPPENED DURING TRUMP'S FIRST TERM. YOU THINK HE WOULD REMEMBER HE BRAGGED ABOUT IT AT THE TIME AND SAID THE KURDS STOOD WITH US WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY OBJECTIVE OF THE UNITED STATES THE DESTRUCTION OF ISIS AND THE TEMPORARY CALIPHATE. WE ACHIEVE THIS WITHOUT SENDING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS OR SPENDING A QUARTER TRILLION DOLLARS AS WE DID WITH THE IRAQ SURGE. INDEED THE OBAMA BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WORKED ALONGSIDE OUR PARTNERS IN SYRIA, THE KURDS THE SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC FORCES, BUT JUST A FEW HUNDRED AMERICANS STOPPING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LOCAL FIGHTERS TO TAKE THE FIGHT TO ISIS ON THE GROUND. THE STRATEGY WAS SO SUCCESSFUL IT TURNED OUT THE SECRET PLAN TO DEFEAT ISIS IS TO KEEP DOING WHAT WE PUT IN PLACE UNTIL LAST WEEK. THOSE BRAVE KURDISH AND ARAB FORCES PAID A STEEP PRICE TO DEFEAT ISIS IN THE CALIPHATE THEY LOST OVER 10000 SOLDIERS. 10000. 10000. DEAD. THEY MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE AND THEN TRUMP SOLD THEM OUT. ALL IT TOOK WAS ONE PHONE CALL FROM THE PRESIDENT OF TURKEY WHO KNEW VERY WELL. SO NOW INSTEAD OF BEING A RELIABLE AMERICAN PARTNER TO MAINTAIN STABILITY KEEPING A LID ON TERRORISM THE KURDS HAVE HAD TO MAKE THE ONLY BARGAIN THEY COULD MAKE TO AVOID BEING WIPED OUT IN THEIR WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO BE WIPED OUT. WITH THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE TURKEY MILITARY THEY MADE A DEAL WITH TWO DEVILS. BASHIR ASIDE WHO HEADS THE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA. THAT'S THE DEAL. BUT NOW BEING HANDED OVER TO THOSE TWO PEOPLE, CONTROL OF NORTHWEST SYRIA. THE BRUTAL RUSSIAN AND IRANIAN BACKED REGIMES HOW DOES AMERICA STAY SAFE AND HOW DOES THAT ADVANCE OUR INTEREST AROUND THE WORLD? THE ANSWER IS QUITE SIMPLE, IT DOESN'T. HOW DOES IT BENEFIT OUR ADVERSARIES, RUSSIA THE GREATEST INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT SYRIA, TO ENCOURAGE IRAN TO BE MORE ENGAGED ON THE WESTERN AND EASTERN SHORE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN. AND THEN TO SIT BACK AND WATCH ONE NATO ALLY TO POSE A DISTINCTION ON - - IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON ANOTHER TO FURTHER HIS GOAL OF FRACTURING THE NATO ALLIANCE. IRAN AND HEZBOLLAH TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL. ISIS WHICH IS CLEARLY SEEN TO BE GROUP IS NOW RELEASED BACK INTO THE REGION. EVERY SINGLE STRONGMAN AS A DICTATOR AROUND THE WORLD TO ABANDON OUR PARTNERS UNDER THE SMALLEST AMOUNT OF PRESSURE. WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY WILL DO? ALL WE ARE LEFT WITH OF AMERICAN CREDIBILITY. MORE CHAOS, MORE STABILITY, MORE THREATS THESE ARE OUR PARTNERS AND ALLIES IN THE REGION. POINTED OUT ALONG THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST PLACED. WHO'S COMING? THEY WILL GO TO EUROPE. THAT'S OKAY. AND WITH TRUMP'S ARGUMENT OR WITH THOSE FOREVER WARS HE MAY HAVE CAVED TO PUTIN AND ERGOGAN BUT ALSO THE DEPLOYMENT OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL TROOPS INTO THE GULF OF SAUDI ARABIA. FOR ANOTHER CRISIS WITH THE ONE WITH IRAN BUT THIS TIME THE CRISIS WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN IRAN WE HAVE TO GO ALONE. NONE OF OUR PARTNERS WANT IN ON THE DEAL. AMERICA, YOU CAUSE A PROBLEM, YOU DEAL. YOU DEAL WITH THE TERRORISTS COMING OUT OF IRAN. NOT US. THIS IS NOT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP. THIS IS BENDING TO THE WILL OF A STRONG MAN. THIS IS A RECIPE FOR MORE FOREVER WARS. HE IS STILL MORE THAN ONE YEAR IN OFFICE. GOD FOR BID US FOUR YEARS AFTER THAT? AS ERRATIC AS HE HAS BECOME THE MORE HE IS CERTAIN I WILL BEAT HIM LIKE A DRUM. [APPLAUSE] REALLY. THINK ABOUT IT DID YOU EVER THINK YOU'D SEE AT TIMES SPENDING $10 MILLION ON ADS THIS FAR OUT IN THE OTHER PARTY'S PRIMARY TO PICK WHO THE CANDIDATE WOULD BE? OVER 70 POLLS IN A ROW SHOWING ME DEFEATING HIM AS I BECOME THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTENTION IMAGINE WHAT DAMAGE HE COULD DO. EITHER INTENTIONALLY WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL FACE ENORMOUS CHALLENGES OF AMERICAN FOREIGN-POLICY TO SALVAGE OUR REPUTATION TO REBUILD THE CONFIDENCE WHAT WE SAY WHAT WE DO WE KEEP OUR WORD. THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THE WORLD AS HE OR SHE FINDS IT JANUARY 2021 WHATEVER THE STATE OF DISARRAY TRUMP LEAVES IT. THERE WON'T BE TIME TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS. WE NEED A LEADER ON DAY ONE TO PICK UP THE TELEPHONE TO CALL THE ALLIES TO KNOW THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL DO OUR TREATY OBLIGATIONS AND STANDBY DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM. AT FIRST WITH EVERY SINGLE WORLD LEADER STILL ON THE STAGE I HAVE NEGOTIATED WITH ERGOGAN I KNOW HOW HE OPERATES PROGRESSIVE SPENT MORE TIME WITH HIM ALONE I BELIEVE THAN THE PRESIDENT HAS. IN FACT, THE REASON THE UNITED STATES PARTNERED WITH THE KURDISH MILITIA IN SYRIA IN THE FIRST PLACE IS BECAUSE TURKEY DRAGGED ITS HEELS ON HELPING US TO DEFEAT ISIS. REMEMBER ALL THE PEOPLE LED IN ACROSS THE BORDER TO GO FIGHT WITH ISIS? THE TURKISH BORDER? I SPENT HOURS WITH MY SECURITY TEAM GOING OVER PROPOSALS WITH ERGOGAN. HE WANTED US TO LEVERAGE TO DEAL WITH OUR CONCERN WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD HE WANTS US TO DECLARE WAR TO SEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS INTO SYRIA. BUT WE WOULD NOT DO THAT. THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT EITHER THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE PEOPLE WANT ANOTHER ENDLESS WAR. IN FACT UNLIKE THE PRESIDENT HE GAVE ME THE AUTHORITY TO TELL ERGOGAN KNOW. BUT WE KEPT WORKING WITH TURKEY. HELPING THEM WITH THE SYRIAN REFUGEES FLOWING OUT OF SYRIA. DESIGNED AS MUCH HUMANITARIAN AID AS WE COULD TO ALLEVIATE AS MUCH SUFFERING AS POSSIBLE FOR ALSO THOSE FLEEING VIOLENCE TO OUR SHORES WE PUT IN PLACE A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY FOR THE KURDS TO BRING DOWN ISIS WHILE PREVENTING THE TURKS AND THE KURDS FROM COMING TO BLOWS. THERE WILL NEVER BE A SOLUTION IN SYRIA THAT SATISFIES OUR BEST HOPE FOR A REGION OF PEACE WITHIN ITSELF. NO ONE ONCE AMERICAN TROOPS TO BE FOREVER EMBROILED IN CONFLICT IN THE MEAT - - MIDDLE EAST OR NATION BUILDING. THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SENDING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF COMBAT TROOPS TO THE MIDDLE EAST INDEFINITELY WHICH I OPPOSED ONLY USING SMALL OPERATORS TO SUPPORT LOCAL FORCES TO DO THE FIGHTING AND ADVANCING OUR COMMON INTEREST. I WAS SURPRISED LAST NIGHT IN THE DEBATE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES SAID SHE WITHDREW ALL THE TROOPS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST. WE CAN BE STRONG AND SMART AT THE SAME TIME. AND WHEN WE DO DRAWDOWN THERE'S A RIGHT WAY AND THE WRONG WAY. AND WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE IN SYRIA IS DISASTROUSLY WRONG. SO THIS TRUMP CREATED CRISIS THAT EVOLVES FURTHER INTO CHAOS, WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING? WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW? FIRST WE SHOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THE NATO ALLIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO BRING MORE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES TO THE TABLE. THE UNITED STATES AND TURKEY ARE ALLIES EVEN IF THEY DON'T ACT LIKE ONE. SO WE SHOULD BE FIGHTING A BROADER COALITION TO PULL BACK OPERATIONS. AS WELL AS SEES THE CALLOUS DISREGARD FOR CIVILIANS. THE COMMUNITY SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE INVESTIGATE IN THE REPORTS OF WAR CRIMES TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THOSE ARE RESPONSIBLE. THE SECOND THING YOU SHOULD DO WITH THAT IMMEDIATE RESULT THAT THERE IS A WAY THERE IS NO NEGOTIATION. THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE SET UP TO FACILITATE THOSE TALKS IN THE FREE WORLD REQUIRES US TO SHOW UP AND HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME. WE SHOULDN'T BE DELEGATING THIS TO PUTIN. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE CRITICALLY HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT WITH THE REFUGEE CRISIS UNFOLDING BEFORE OUR VERY EYES. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SENDING HUMANITARIAN AID TO SYRIA BUT THAT IS ONLY ONE QUARTER OF THE 200 MILLION THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN SENT BUT HE SUSPENDED THAT LAST YEAR. HOW WILL THAT BE DISTRIBUTED? ON THE FRONT LINE HUMANITARIAN GROUPS ALL THROUGH THE REGION, HOW WILL THEY DO THIS AS THEY PULL THE STAFF OUT OF THE AREAS WE ARE FIGHTING? WE SHOULD BE WILLING TO CARRY OUT THE AIR LIFTS AND FIRE ON - - FOOD AND WATER AND TO REMAIN LASER FOCUSED TO PREVENT ANY RESURGENCE OF ISIS. INTO PRISON VENT VILLAGES FROM TURKISH ATTACK IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE ISIS RE- GROWING AND FILLING THE VOID. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN FOR OUR OWN SAFETY SAKE. NO MATTER HOW MUCH DONALD TRUMP TWEETS IT'S EASY FOR EUROPEANS TO ESCAPE ISIS FIGHTERS OR FOR US TO GO BACK. THAT DIDN'T WORK BEFORE. THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKED THE FIRST TIME AND CERTAINLY NOT NOW IF WE HAVE TO FIGHT ISIS AGAIN. DURING OUR ADMINISTRATION WE BUILD A COALITION TO TAKE ON ISIS WITH 81 PARTNERS THAT WAS PART OF MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PUT THAT TOGETHER. EIGHTY OTHER NATIONS TO PARTICIPATE WITH US TO CURTAIL THEIR EXPANSION WITH THE CALIPHATE AND THOSE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD, BECAUSE THEY TRUSTED THE WORD OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA UNDER THE OBAMA BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. ASK YOURSELF IF THERE'S ANYTHING TRUMP HAS DONE, ANY INTERNATIONAL TREATY, ANY ALLY ALLY, AFTER LEAVING PARTNERS TO BE SLAUGHTERED WITH NO DISCERNIBLE STRATEGY, TAKING THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS THUGS IN THE WORLD FROM KIM JUNG-UN TO PUTIN, WHO WILL STAND WITH US? HOW MANY MORE BRAVE SONS AND DAUGHTERS DO WE HAVE TO SEND TO FIGHT ALONE TO PROTECT US? AND THAT BRINGS ME TO MY FINAL POINT TODAY. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING WHAT HE'S DOING IN SYRIA IT IS MUCH BIGGER THAN SYRIA IT'S MORE INSIDIOUS THAN THE BETRAYAL OF OUR PARTNERS AND MORE DANGEROUS THAN TAKING THE BOOT OFF THE NECK OF ISIS. HE IS DEMOLISHING THE MORAL AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THE CONFIDENCE IS SO EXTREME IN THE ABUSE OF POWER IS SO RAMPANT THAT HE IS TORCHING AMERICA'S INFLUENCE AND THE ABILITY TO GET THINGS DONE AROUND THE WORLD. CLIMATE CHANGE. 85 PERCENT WILL COME BACK TO COOPERATE WITH US WHEN WE PUT TOGETHER THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. MASS MIGRATION. FROM VENEZUELA AND OTHER PLACES. UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES. NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION. THE ASCENDANCY OF CHINA AND THE RESURGENCE OF RUSSIA. HOW WILL WE MEET THESE CHALLENGES WE FACE IF THE UNITED STATES IS EVER REDUCED IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD TO BE AN UNRELIABLE PARTNER? WHO WAS GOING TO STAND WITH US? NOT JUST A SERIES OF HANDSHAKES AND PHOTO OPPORTUNITIES. IT IS BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS. CONSTANTLY BUILDING AND MAINTAINING. WORKING TO IDENTIFY THE COMMON INTERESTS OR OF MANAGING POINTS OF CONFLICT THAT IS A TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS TO EMPOWER AND A COHERENT NATIONAL SECURITY PROCESS FOR EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE EXECUTED. ALMOST THREE YEARS AS PRESIDENT TRUMP STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS. AND NEVER WILL. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE THE ONLY THING HE CARES ABOUT IS DONALD TRUMP. NOT OUR ALLIES, NOT HER NEIGHBORS, NOT OUR DIPLOMATS ARE VALUES OR LEADERSHIP. NOT OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD. NOT THE INCREDIBLE HUMAN SUFFERING THAT IS BEING CAUSED. NOT EVEN WITH ISIS THAT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORIST GROUP IN MODERN HISTORY. HOW MANY THINK THEY WILL REGENERATE ONCE AGAIN TO GAIN STRENGTH AND THREATEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. IT SHOULD MATTER TO EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN THIS IS NOT AN ABSTRACT SPEECH BEFORE THE COUNCIL OF FOREIGN RELATIONS IN NEW YORK CITY. OR A GROUP OF FOREIGN POLICY EXPERTS. THIS IS EVERY DAY AMERICANS AND EVERY SINGLE FAMILY. WHAT DOES AMERICA STAND FOR? WHO DO WE WANT TO BE? UNITED STATES WORKS WITH OUR PARTNERS OF DEMOCRACIES FOR THE SAKE OF OUR OWN NATIONAL SECURITY AND HER OWN PROSPERITY. NO COUNTRY MORE THAN OURS CAN GO ALONE AGAINST THE CHALLENGES OF RESPECTING HER BORDERS THAT CANNOT BE CONTAINED BY LAWS. THE INVESTMENT WE HAVE MADE HAVE COME BACK TENFOLD. AND THEN TO ATTACK THOSE GLOBAL CHALLENGES AND THEN TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE US. I MET A GENTLEMAN AT THE AIRPORT WITH VIETNAM VETERANS. AT THE TIME IS THAT WITH ME JUST BEFORE I CAME OVER HERE TALKING ABOUT GOING AGAINST BEING THE WORLD'S POLICEMAN. AMERICA FIRST MEANS AMERICA ALONE. HOW DO WE DEAL WITH A CRISIS THAT WILL AFFECT US IN EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN IN IOWA AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY? ALL THE PLACES AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SURVIVE IN THE FAIR TRADE POLICY. HOW DO WE DO THAT? MAKE NO MISTAKE. NATIONS WILL MAKE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN THE PICTURE AND MAKE THEIR OWN DEALS TO BE A PART OF AN ALLIANCE. WHAT DO THEY KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP'S VISION EVERYTHING THAT AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT FOR AND SACRIFICED, I BELIEVE WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP THINKS WE ARE. THAT WE CAN AND MUST BE THE NATION THE WORLD LOOKS TO MOBILIZES OTHERS FOR COMMON GOOD AS A BEACON OF LIBERTY. WITH THOSE OPPRESSED OPTIONS IN A BULWARK OF DEMOCRACY. A CHAMPION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. A LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. ALL OF THIS IS ON THE BALLOT THIS NOVEMBER. THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE IF WE WANT TO RETAKE OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD TO KEEP THE UNITED STATES SAFE AND SECURE BECAUSE WE BUILT ON OUR ALLIANCES AND CHOOSE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL REBUILD OUR CREDIBILITY TO RESTORE THE VALUE OF AMERICA'S WORD. I PROMISE YOU IF WE DO NOT OTHERS WILL MAKE ACCOMMODATIONS. IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT NATO OR THE EUROPEAN ALLIANCE. IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT ALLIANCES IN THE PACIFIC. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR SOME OF THESE NATIONS TO NO LONGER TAKE OUR WORD BEFORE THEY DECIDE TO GO NUCLEAR? BEFORE THEY DECIDE BEFORE THEY DECIDE THEY HAVE TO MAKE AN ACCOMMODATION WITH PUTIN OR CHINA? FOLKS, THIS POLICY IS A DISASTER THIS PRESIDENT IS A DISASTER. WE CAN CHANGE THAT. IT IS TOTALLY WITHIN OUR POWER. HAVE TO BE SURE WHAT WE MEAN AND EXPLAIN WHAT WE DO AND MAKE NO APOLOGIES SO THE WORLD OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC CAN LOOK AT WHOEVER WE PICK AND SAY I BELIEVE THAT PERSON AND I BELIEVE ONE DAY NUMBER ONE THAT PERSON IS READY TO COMMAND THE WORLD STAGE, DOES NOT MEAN ON-THE-JOB TRAINING AND IS KNOWN BY EVERYBODY FROM PUTIN TO OUR ALLIES TO BE WHAT HE SAYS WHAT THEY ARE. AND NOT TO DO ANYTHING THOROUGHLY RECKLESS BUT WE CANNOT. AND FOREVER CHANGE THE NATION OF WHO WE ARE. THAT'S MY INTENTION. THANK YOU GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.

HOW ARE YOU DOING? MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN I'M JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND AND VALERIE'S BROTHER IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK WITH SO MANY OLD FRIENDS I HAVE BEEN HERE A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE PAST THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THINGS WE HAVE DONE TO BUILD A PARTY. YOU HAVE BEEN THE HEART AND SOUL NOT HYPERBOLE INCLUDING THE TOUGH FIGHTS. BUT WHEN WE DID IT WASN'T ALWAYS ON THE FIRST TRY EITHER. BUT THE RECORD WILL SHOW WE WON MOST OF THEM TOGETHER. AND IT'S DUE TO THE POWER AND RESILIENCE OF SO MANY WOMEN IN THIS ROOM I SAW THOSE QUALITIES FIRSTHAND BY THE WAY BECAUSE I'M CHARACTERIZED AS THE OLD GUY BUT I HAVE CAMPAIGNED IN DISTRICT CAMPAIGNS FOR MORE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES THAN ANYBODY AROUND AND THIS LAST TIME OUT I WENT INTO 24 STATES CAMPAIGNING FOR OVER 60 CANDIDATES AND ALONGSIDE WALKING DOOR TO DOOR TO SPEAK AT RALLIES WITH 33 WOMEN LAST YEAR. MOST IN THE RED AND PURPLE STATES. I CAN SAY WITHOUT FEAR OF CONTRADICTION THE MOST REMARKABLE GROUP OF QUALIFIED CANDIDATES I HAVE EVER CAMPAIGNED FOR. [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE HELPED TO CHANGE IN THIS ROOM IS THAT WE NO LONGER TALK ABOUT WOMEN'S ISSUES. EVERY SINGLE ISSUE IS A WOMAN'S ISSUE. [APPLAUSE] THE ECONOMY, GUNS, HEALTHCARE ECONOMY, GUNS, HEALTHCARE, NATIO NAL SECURITY. THE WOMEN THAT I CAMPAIGNED FOR THEY HAD GRADUATED FROM ONE OF THE ACADEMIES WHETHER NAVAL OR AIR FORCE ET CETERA. AND EVEN IN THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE ONE CAMPAIGNED FOR ME. THEY FORGOT MORE ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY. THIS IS NOT A JOKE THEN DONALD TRUMP WILL EVER KNOW. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW. REALLY. THE AIR FORCE CAPTAINS AND THE ATTENDANT THING COMMANDERS. THE FIRST MARINE FIGHTER PILOT IN COMBAT WOMEN UNDERSTAND IN THEIR BONES WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE THE BACKS OF OUR ALLIES WHEN WE MAKE A COMMITMENT. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW WE THINK ABOUT THESE IN MALE TERMS BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT IS CHANGING HERE. YES TOLD YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS THERE'S NOT A DAMN THING MY SON COULD DO THAT MY DAUGHTER COULD NOT DO AS WELL AND IT HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED AROUND THE WORLD. I UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF WHAT IT MEANS WHEN WE ABANDON IT'S NO SURPRISE THOSE WOMEN 25 THAT WE WON BACK THE HOUSE BECAUSE OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] AND THEY ARE ALL FIGHTERS. LAST SMART LAWN - - LAST MONTH MARKED THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST FIGHT. I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST DRAFTED THE ACT THERE WAS DIFFICULTY TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE TRY THAT BEFORE AND IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE MAYBE WE SHOULD NOT BE ENGAGED WITH CHOICE AND GENDER BUT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE SAID YOU'RE ALREADY DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE CRISIS CENTERS. AS SOME OF YOU REMEMBER WHAT OUR OPPONENT SAID WHEN WE SUGGEST WE HAVE FEDERALLY FUNDED WOMEN'S SHELTERS AND THIS WAS LITERALLY REPEATED THROUGH THE FUNDAMENTAL CHURCHES BIDEN WANT TO SET UP THE INDOCTRINATION CENTERS IS NOT A JOKE OF COURSE WE WERE FACING A POLITICAL ATTACK WE CONTINUE TO FACE THE NEED TO CHANGE AMERICAN CULTURE AND HOW WE TREAT WOMEN IN SOCIETY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS CONSIDERED A FAMILY AFFAIR AS A MEMBER OF THE CHRISTIAN COALITION THOSE THAT SUPPORTED US TO SAY BIDEN IS BREAKING UP FAMILIES THE BURDEN OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WAS ALWAYS LAID OUT THE WOMAN'S FEET. WHAT WERE YOU WEARING? DID YOU HAVE ON A BRA WE WEARING A SLIP? WHAT DID YOU SAY? REMEMBER THAT LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN WHO CAME TO NEW YORK CITY I CONVINCED HER TO TESTIFY ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SHE WANTED TO LEAVE HER APARTMENT COMPLEX ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE AND HAD A RESTAURANT BAR ON THE FIRST FLOOR. THE LANDLORD KEPT HARASSING HER EVERY TIME SHE WANTED TO MOVE FROM A EFFICIENCY TO A ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT SO SHE GOT A CALL WHEN DOING A SHOOT AND SAID IF YOU STOP AT THE RESTAURANT ON THE WAY BACK WE WILL HAVE SIGNED A CONTRACT I HAVE A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. SHE DID WHEN SHE STOPPED SHE WENT TO SIGN THE AGREEMENT AND HE HIT ON HER AGAIN SO SHE WALKED OUT SO THEY SLASHED HER FACE WITH RAZORS BECAUSE HE HIRED TWO GOONS. AND I ASKED HER BEFORE SHE TESTIFIED ABOUT PUBLIC OPINION AT THE TIME WHAT DID YOUR MOTHER SAY? SHE SAID WHY WAS I IN A BAR? WHAT DID YOUR GIRLFRIEND SAY TO YOU? WHAT WE WEARING? HOW SHORT WAS YOUR SKIRT? FOLKS, THESE ARE INSIDIOUS AND DESTRUCTIVE WAYS TO APPROACH AN ISSUE. WE ARE STILL FIGHTING THIS BACKWARD THINKING TODAY BUT BECAUSE OF THE INCREDIBLE BRAVERY OF THOSE WHO CAME FORWARD WITH THEIR STORIES AND THEN TO BEGIN TO BREAK THE DAM OF CULTURAL RESISTANCE WE PASSED THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT THAT AS WE EXPANDED THE COVERAGE BUT I WANTED TO DO FROM THE BEGINNING BUT COULD NOT GET DONE WE AUTHORIZATION IS TO IMPROVE THE LAW AND COVER MORE PEOPLE NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN LGBT COMMUNITY OF WHAT WE SHOULD'VE DONE 25 YEARS AGO AND COULD NOT GET IT DONE. WE GOT IT DONE ALONG THE WAY BUT STILL TODAY MITCH MCCONNELL AND REPUBLICANS THAT THE BOYFRIEND LOOPHOLE I TRY TO SAY YOU CAN'T OWN A WEAPON EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT MARRIED WITH A DOMESTIC ABUSE ORDER OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR MISDEMEANORS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE NRA WHAT IS HAPPENING? WHETHER YOU HAVE A DATING PARTNER RATHER THAN BEING MARRIED. YOU SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND NOBODY SHOULD HAVE A WEAPON. WHAT ALSO KEEPS FIREARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF CONVICTED FOLKS? THINK ABOUT THIS. THINK ABOUT WHAT HE SOLD OUT TO THE NRA IN A WAY THAT IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS. WE HAVE TO GET THIS PAST PROGRAM SORRY TO RAISE THIS WITH YOU NOW THAT WE NEED YOUR VOICES IN ADDITION TO HELPING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WIN BUT TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE AND PUT THE PRESSURE ON THIS ADMINISTRATION ON THIS PRESIDENT BUT MORE PORTLY ON THE CONGRESS AND UNITED STATES SENATE TO FORCE THEM TO HAVE TO VOTE. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE I DON'T THINK IT'S AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP NOT ONLY IS A PRESIDENT THAT HAS BELITTLED WOMEN AND DEGRADED THAN HIS WHOLE LIFE LIFE, NOW HE HAS GONE BEYOND THAT TO STRIKE AT THE HEART OF OUR DEMOCRACY. HIS ENTIRE LIFE IS BUILT ON ABUSE OF POWER. SO I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE FINALLY ON TO HIM. AND THE MORE THAT CONGRESS FOCUSES ON HIS CORRUPT BEHAVIOR THE MORE ERRATIC HE WILL BECOME. HE HAS ANOTHER YEAR IN OFFICE. MAYBE. MAY BE. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST CORRUPT ADMINISTRATION IN ALL OF AMERICAN HISTORY. IT IS ROTTEN TO THE CORE. SCORES OF ADVISORS AND MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION THEY HAVE GONE TO JAIL CONVICTED OF FELONIES AND OTHERS WILL BE GOING TO JAIL. [APPLAUSE] AND HE GETS MORE VICIOUS AND ERRATIC AND SELF-SERVING AS THE ACCOUNTABILITY CLOSES IN ON HIM. IT HAS GONE SO FAR TO CROSS THE LINE. I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE A FRUSTRATED HISTORIAN BETTY GEORGE WASHINGTON SAID FIRST THING AFTER BECOMING PRESIDENT PRESIDENT, THE MOST SERIOUS THREAT OUR REPUBLIC FACES, I AM PARAPHRASING, IS INTERFERENCE FROM FOREIGN POWERS. THEY BRING DOWN THE REPUBLIC. GUESS WHAT? WHAT HAS HE DONE? NOW HAS INVITED THREE FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO ENGAGE AND INTERFERE IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. HE HAS $10 MILLION OF ADS WORKING OUT THERE TO SAY I WILL BEAT THEM AGAIN THE NRA. THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. WITH THE HUNTSMAN ONE - - HENCHMEN AND HIS THUGS WITH THIS INVOLVEMENT. SO TWO OF THOSE GOT ARRESTED SNEAKING OUT OF THE COUNTRY WARREN GOT ARRESTED COMING BACK INTO THE COUNTRY. ONE OF THOSE MASTERMINDS RUDY GIULIANI. [LAUGHTER] HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HERE. [LAUGHTER] HE REFUSES TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND THAT REMINDS ME OF THE LINE FROM VOLTAIRE THAT SAID SAID. I HAVE NEVER MADE ONE PRAYER TO GOD. OLD LORD MAKE MY ENEMIES RIDICULOUS AND GOD GRANTED IT. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] AND GOD HAS GRANTED IT AGAIN TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. [LAUGHTER] THIS ELECTION IS NOT TO GET ME OUT OF THE RACE BUT IT'S ABOUT YOU AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT'S ABOUT HEALTHCARE WE HAVE TO OVERCOME THE SPECIAL INTEREST INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO PRAY AND PAY A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN CAN CHOOSE THE PUBLIC OPTION THAT BY THE WAY WE CAN FULLY AFFORD TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD HAS ACCESS TO A GOOD EDUCATION REGARDLESS OF THE CODE AND WHEN YOU DO THAT SO EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN AMERICA THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE YEARS OLD AND THEN TO PAY TEACHERS WHAT THEY DESERVE. [APPLAUSE] NO MATTER WHAT THEIR GRADES ARE THE DEAD BY CODIFYING ROE V WADE AS A MATTER OF LAW. THE MEANS OF FEAR AND PANIC RELATED TO GUN VIOLENCE YOU SEE THEM HERE TO DEATH AND THEY TEACH YOU HOW TO MOVE IN AND NOT BE CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE. IT IS THE SINGLE GREATEST CONCERN. CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIVE AND 17 THINK THEY WILL BE SHOT IN SCHOOL. WHAT HAVE WE BECOME? WE HAVE TO TAKE SOMETHING ON THE NRA I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS BEATEN THEM NATIONALLY I'VE BEEN THEM TWICE IF I'M THE NOMINEE I PROMISE YOU I WILL BEAT THEM LIKE A DRUM AGAIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE THE WOMAN I ASKED TO BE ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, DIANE FEINSTEIN IS THE REASON WE FINALLY MY - - FINALLY GOT THIS. ELIMINATING MAGAZINES WITH MULTIPLE MOUNT YOU CANNOT RUN AROUND WITH MORE THAN THREE SHOTGUN SHELLS WITH A MAGAZINE THAT CARRIES 100 ROUNDS. WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE WE DOING? THAT MEANS TAKING ON THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND REJOINING THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD TO MAKE SURE IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF MY ADMINISTRATION ALL OF THOSE MEMBERS OF THE CLIMATE ACCORD WILL COME TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO RECOMMIT TO FOR WHAT THEY CAN DO THEY MAKE UP 85 PERCENT OF THE PROBLEM. IF WE DON'T LEAD IT THE VACUUM WILL BE FILLED BY OTHERS WHO DON'T HAVE INTEREST FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SO WE HAVE TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. LITERALLY WE CANNOT GET A DAMN THING DONE UNLESS HE IS DEFEATED. IT WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO BE CALLED INTO WHOEVER WINS THE RACE IT WILL TAKE A HELLUVA LOT OF WORK TO MAKE UP FOR THE DAMAGE HE IS DONE INTERNATIONALLY AND NATIONALLY. THE THUGS AND CO-CONSPIRATORS WILL UNDERMINE THE DEMOCRACY IN THE MEANTIME. IMAGINE WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN UKRAINE. MORE IMPORTANTLY BUT IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN OF IRAN. WHEN HE EMBRACES THE THUGS AROUND THE WORLD LIKE KIM JUNG-UN LIKE ANY BULLY I HAVE EVER KNOWN. BUT HE IS DEFINITELY AFRAID. THAT HE SHOULD BE BECAUSE OF THE WOMEN IN THIS ROOM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEN YOU WILL GO OUT AND HIT THEM LIKE A DRUM. BUT I'M SO TIRED OF DEMOCRATS WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN LIKE WHOA IS ME. WHAT WILL BE DUE? HOW CAN WE GET ANYTHING DONE? WE ARE BETTER POSITIONED THAN ANY NATION IN THE WORLD TO ON THE 21st CENTURY. WHAT I GOT ELECTED AS A 29 -YEAR-OLD KID I WAS LABELED AS THE IDEALISTIC OPTIMISTIC GUY. WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS IN THE WORLD MORE RESEARCH AND DIVERSITY MORE CHANGES TAKEN PLACE THAN ALL OVER THE WORLD COMBINED WHERE SITUATION THERE'S NOT A DAMN THING WE CAN DO. I SPENT THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF MY LIFE WORKING ON HOW TO BE CANCER. WE ARE ON OUR WAY. IMAGINE WHAT WE CAN DO FOR THOSE AROUND THE WORLD TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF HOW WE RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER. FOLKS, I AM SO DAMN TIRED OF US FORGETTING OF WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THERE HAS NEVER EVER BEEN A TIME WHEN AMERICA SETS ITS MIND TO SOMETHING IT HAS NOT GOTTEN IT DONE THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LET'S TAKE IT BACK AND LEAD THE WORLD AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR PROTECTING THE TROOPS AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

EASTERN, WE WILL HEAR A POINT COUNTERPOINT DISCUSSION WITH JAMES CARVILLE AND SEAN HANNITY. AT 8:40, AL FRANKEN MAKES HIS RETURN TO THE NATIONAL SCENE. ON WEDNESDAY, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AND 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN VISITED HIS HOME TOWN OF SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. HE SPOKE ABOUT GROWING UP IN SCRANTON AND HOW HIS PROPOSED ECONOMIC PLAN CAN HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS. THIS IS ABOUT ONE HOUR. GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. MY NAME IS ROSEMARY BOLAND. I AM A TEACHER AND PRESIDENT OF THE SCRANTON FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. I THANK YOU FOR THAT. THAT IS NOT USUALLY HOW I'M GREETED. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I AM A PROUD MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. I AM ON THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS PENNSYLVANIA AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE AFL-CIO PENNSYLVANIA. SORT OF TELLS YOU WHO I AM. I AM HONORED THAT I WAS ASKED TO DO THIS INTERACTION THIS MORNING. I AM A SCHOOLTEACHER FROM THE SOUTH SIDE OF PENNSYLVANIA. I AM REALLY HONORED THAT THIS HAPPENED TO ME. I TAUGHT 10-YEAR-OLDS AND 11-YEAR-OLDS AND TOLD THEM THESE THINGS COULD HAPPEN. I DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ME. THE FACT THAT WE ARE HERE AND I'M ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS MORNING IS TRULY AMAZING TO ME. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY HOW MUCH I'M NOT APPRECIATIVE THAT JOE BIDEN ENTERED THIS RACE. [APPLAUSE] NOT JUST BECAUSE HE IS A FRIENDLY , BUT HE ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATES EDUCATION. PUBLIC EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] MY DISTRICT, THE SCRANTON SCHOOL DISTRICT IS IN WHAT THEY CALL FINANCIAL RECOVERY, WHICH MEANS WE ARE BROKE. IF WE WERE UNIQUE, THAT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT, BUT WE ARE NOT. YOU HAVE WATCHED TELEVISION AND YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES TEACHERS THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY HAVE HAD TO WALK IN ORDER TO GET THE SALARIES THEY DESERVE OR THE HEALTH CARE THEY DESERVE. WHAT ABOUT OUR STUDENTS? ONE OF THE THINGS I AM HAPPY ABOUT IS MR. BIDEN'S PLAN, TITLE I FUNDING. HE WANTS TO TRIPLE THAT. MOST OF US DEPEND ON THESE FUNDS FOR OUR STUDENTS. IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT, WE HAVE A PROUD HERITAGE. WE HAVE PRE-K THREE AND FOUR-YEAR-OLD EDUCATION. WE ARE UNIQUE IN THAT AND HAVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS. OUR CHILDREN DESERVE THAT THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE TO NEGOTIATE, THIS IS SOMETHING EVERY PYRO , EVERY CHILD AND PARENT IN THE UNITED STATES DESERVES. HOW ABOUT THE FACT WE HAVE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS? HOW ABOUT THAT? HOW ABOUT IF WE CORRECTLY , IF WE CORRECT THE IDEA AND ACTUALLY FUNDED? , FUND IT? WHAT IF WE ACTUALLY HELP OUR NEEDY CHILDREN INSTEAD OF PUTTING CHILDREN IN CAGES? [APPLAUSE] I THINK IT IS TIME, ALSO, THAT PEOPLE PAID ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT WE, IN EDUCATION, ARE DESPERATELY IN NEED OF COLLEGES, WE NEED MORE COUNSELORS, WE WE IN THE SCRANTON SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE 38 OPEN LANGUAGES. 38. WE HAVE TO WORK WITH ALL OF THOSE FAMILIES AND ALL OF THOSE CHILDREN. WE NEED HELP, AND WE NEED LOTS OF IT, AND SO DOES EVERY TEACHER IN EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT IS HARD FOR ME TO SAY THIS. FOR THE LAST ALMOST FOUR YEARS, THE CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED. THE OTHER MORNING, I READ THE NEWSPAPER LOCALLY, THAT THE LATEST THING FROM THE PRESIDENT IS TO CUT FUNDS FOR BREAKFAST AND LUNCH. SHAME ON HIM. SHAME ON HIM. SHAME ON HIM IS RIGHT. . THE PRIVILEGED SHOULD REALIZE THAT IT IS THEIR DUTY AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE WHAT THEY HAVE. IT IS TIME TO START LEARNING TO SHARE, AND SHARE AMONG OUR NEEDIEST IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT BEGINS WITH THREE AND FOUR EUROS COMING TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS , FOUR-YEAR-OLDS COME INTO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN GETTING THE START THEY DESERVE. I DON'T WANT TO JUST STOP WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME WITH 10 AND 11 EUROS, SO I WAS GIVEN AN EDUCATION. BUT, I DON'T WANT TO FORGET THAT EDUCATION GOES BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL AND IT GOES INTO THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES, AND THE TRADES, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT MAYBE IT IS TIME WE INVESTED SOME TIME AND MONEY, AND MAYBE ACTUALLY, IT IS TIME THAT WE WORKED ON PUBLIC SERVICE AND LOAN FORGIVENESS. AND GIVE PEOPLE A BOOST UP. [APPLAUSE] BUT, I DO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT REPRESENTING THE 900 MEMBERS OF THE TEACHERS IS ONE OF MY PROUDEST ACCOMPANIMENTS OF MY LIFE, AND AS LONG AS THEY KEEP ME WORKING, EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE. BUT WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT SOUTH SCRANTON JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL, SEE? I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT IS STILL LIVING. WHEN I WAS A STUDENT THERE, I WORE A PIN, AND IT WAS PROBABLY AROUND THIS TIME, THE PEN I WORE SAID, \"START PACKING, AMY, THE KENNEDYS ARE COMING.\" SO I SAY TODAY, \"MELANIA, START PACKING, THE BIDENS ARE COMING.\" [APPLAUSE] IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN: THANK YOU. HELLO, FOLKS. HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU. WE WANT JOE! JOE BIDEN: PLEASE, PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT GENEROUS INTRODUCTION. I AM JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND. I'M HAPPY TO BE HOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT REALLY IS GOOD TO BE HOME. SCRANTON, WHEN YOU ARE A KID, NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU LIVE HERE, CLIMBS INTO YOUR HEART AND OCCUPIES YOU. SO MANY PEOPLE YOU KNOW ARE FROM SCRANTON. SO MANY PEOPLE FROM SCRANTON, AND SO MANY GREAT PEOPLE HERE. MY MOTHER, EUGENIA, RAISED IN SCRANTON, FIRST 35 YEARS OF HER LIFE BEFORE MOVING TO DELAWARE. SHE LIVED TO AGE 92, THANK GOD. THE LAST 10 YEARS OF LIFE, SHE LIVED WITH ME. YOU KNOW, AFTER MY DAD PASSED, SHE MOVED IN, BUT IT WAS A STRUGGLE TO GET HER TO MOVE IN WITH US, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN DELAWARE IN OUR THREE BEDROOM, SPLIT LEVEL HOME FOR MOST OF MY LIFE, WE ALWAYS HAD A RELATIVE LIVING WITH US, EITHER MY GRANDPA OR MY GREAT AUNT OR AN UNCLE. THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMEONE IN OUR THREE-BEDROOM HOME WITH FOUR KIDS AND MOM AND DAD. IT WAS GREAT FOR THE KIDS. IT REALLY WAS. IT WAS GREAT HAVING MY GRANDPA WITH US, AND SO ON. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER WAS, MY MOTHER, LOOKING BACK ON IT, THOSE WALLS WERE PRETTY THIN. AND SO, AFTER MY DAD PASSED AWAY, I TRIED TO GET MOM TO MOVE IN WITH ME IN A HOME WE HAD JUST BUILT. I BUILT A SUITE FOR MY MOM AND DAD, BUT MY DAD WAS IN HOSPICE THE LAST FIVE MONTHS OF HIS LIFE IN OUR HOME. BUT MY MOM WOULDN'T MOVE IN BECAUSE SHE SAID SHE WASN'T \"GOING TO DO THAT TO ME.\" BUT I SAID, \"MOM, YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT TO ME. YOU ARE DOING THAT FOR US.\" SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A BURDEN. BUT THAT'S HOW MY SISTER AND BROTHERS WERE RAISED. WE WERE TAUGHT THAT IT IS ALL ABOUT FAMILY. FAMILY. AND FAMILY IS NO BURDEN. EVEN THEN, SHE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY MOVE INTO OUR HOUSE. SHE SOLD HER HOUSE, AND THERE IS A LITTLE BARN ON THE PROPERTY I BOUGHT. THE FIVE ACRES ARE PURCHASED. , I PURCHASED. SHE WANTED ME TO BUILD HER A HOUSE THERE. EVERY NIGHT, I WOULD COME HOME AND GET TO KISS HER GOOD NIGHT. MY WIFE JILL WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF HERS. SHE WOULD SAY, \"EVEN WITH YOUR MOTHER, I CAN SMELL ICE CREAM.\" [LAUGHTER] I GOT TO KISS HER GOOD MORNING AS SHE LEFT TO THE TRAIN. BUT THAT SATISFIED HER PRIDE AND GAVE THE WHOLE FAMILY SOLACE. EVERYTHING MY SISTER, VALERIE, AND I LEARNED CAME FROM SCRANTON. SCRANTON, AS I SAID, CREEPS INTO YOUR HEART AND NEVER LEAVES YOU. WHEN PEOPLE WOULD ASK MY MOM AFTER SHE HAD BEEN IN DELAWARE , NOT AN EXAGGERATION , OVER 50 YEARS, SHE WOULD SAY \"I'M FROM SCRANTON.\" \"I'M FROM SCRANTON.\" NOT A JOKE. SHE AND MY DAD PASSED ALONG THOSE VALUES THAT SCRANTON FAMILIES ARE ALL ABOUT. SHE USED TO SAY, JOE, , \"JOE, REMEMBER, YOU ARE DEFINED BY YOUR COURAGE AND YOU ARE REDEEMED BY YOUR LOYALTY.\" THAT WAS MY GRANDFATHER, AMBROSE FINNEGAN. JOE, COURAGE IS THE GREATEST VIRTUE WITH ALL , VIRTUE OF ALL BECAUSE WITHOUT COURAGE, YOU CAN'T LOVE WITHOUT ABANDON. MY DAD MOVED HERE WITH HIS FATHER AND MOTHER TO DUNMORE WHEN HE WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL. HE WENT TO ST. THOMAS PREP. ALL OF MY EXTENDED FAMILY IS HERE AS WELL, INCLUDING SOME OF MY RELATIVES HERE TODAY, THE FINNEGANS AND GAFFNEYS. MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING MY FATHER TAUGHT ME WAS THAT WE WERE RAISED IN THE SAME TRADITION THAT I FOUND WITH EVERYBODY I CAME IN CONTACT WITH HERE. AND STAYED IN TOUCH WITH THROUGHOUT MY CAREER. EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME NOTION. EVERY SINGLE PERSON, MY DAD USED TO SAY, \"NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE, IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY.\" , THEY ARE ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY.\" \"DIGNITY.\" A WORD I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY USED MORE HERE IN SCRANTON, AT LEAST IN MY EXPERIENCE, THAN ANYWHERE ELSE. IT'S ALL ABOUT DIGNITY, IN A MATTER WHAT YOUR STATION IN LIFE, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR BACKGROUND IS. EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. MY DAD , [APPLAUSE] MY DAD WAS A REAL GENTLEMAN. HE WOULD TELL ME \"JOE, REMEMBER, , SHE WOULD SAY THE SAME TO MY SISTER, EXCEPT HE WOULD SAY A WOMAN , \"YOU HAVE TO BE A MAN OF YOUR WORD, OTHERWISE YOU'RE NOT A MAN.\" IT'S ABOUT HONOR AND IT'S ABOUT FAMILY. I LEARNED THAT MY GRANDPA'S KITCHEN TABLE. NOT A JOKE. HE WOULD SAY, \"JOEY, FAMILY IS THE BEGINNING, THE MIDDLE, AND THE END.\" THE OLDER I GOT, THE MORE I LEARNED TO ADMIRE MY DAD'S COURAGE AND RESILIENCE. WHEN SCRANTON FELL ON HARD TIMES IN THE LATE 1940'S AND EARLY 1950'S, MY DAD , IF YOU LISTEN TO BARACK, HE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT SCRAPPY JOE BIDEN FROM SCRANTON. PEOPLE RESENT THE HELL OUT OF THAT, BECAUSE I REPRESENTED THEM FOR FOUR , FOR YEARS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I WAS IN A PARADE IN A LITTLE TOWN BEFORE MY SON PASSED AWAY, ONE OF THE FAVORITE PARADES MY KIDS WOULD GO TO WITH ME. I WAS WALKING DOWN THE PARADE ROUTE AND THANKING THEM FOR BEING GOOD TO MY BOY, AND THREE GUYS LOOKING LIKE YOU I PLAYED BALL WITH IN SCHOOL CAME BEHIND ME AND SAID, \"WHAT IS ALL OF THIS ABOUT SCRANTON? DAMMIT, YOU'RE FROM DELAWARE.\" [LAUGHTER] BUT MY DAD, LIKE I SAID, IF YOU LISTEN TO BARACK, YOU'D THINK I CLIMBED OUT OF A COAL MINE, BUT MY DAD WAS A WHITE COLOR SALESPERSON. I REMEMBER HIM MAKING WHAT I CALL THE LONGEST WALK, THAT SOME OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS HAD TO MAKE. THE LONGEST WALK UP A SHORT FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO YOUR CHILD'S BEDROOM TO TELL THEM, \"HONEY, YOU CAN'T PLAY IN THE LITTLE LEAGUE ANYMORE. YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A JOB. DAD'S GOT TO MOVE. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO CHANGE.\" I REMEMBER DAD DOING THAT. I REMEMBER BACK TO MY ANCESTRAL HOME UP THERE, A LOVELY WOMAN , A LOVELY PERSON WHO BECAME A FRIEND, , WHO BOUGHT IT FROM MY GRANDPOP. IT JUST BRINGS BACK MEMORIES. HE SAID, \"WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE, HONEY. IT'S ONLY 157 MILES AWAY.\" HE'D BEEN RAISED IN WILMINGTON UNTIL HE WAS A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL. HE SAID, \"ONLY 157 MILES AWAY, AND I WILL COME HOME EVERY WEEKEND.\" I REMEMBER THINKING THAT WAS LIKE GOING TO THE MOON. AND HE DID. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL I GOT A LOT OLDER THAT I REALIZED HOW MUCH IT MUST HAVE AFFECTED HIS PRIDE, HAVING TO WALK INTO THE KITCHEN, AND MY GRANDPA FINNEGAN, WHO HAD FOUR SONS, AND SAY, \"CAN I LEAVE GENE AND THE KIDS HERE WITH YOU? , WITH YOU?\" IT TAKES A LOT OF PRIDE FOR A MAN OR WOMAN TO DO THAT. YOU KNOW, ALTHOUGH IT WAS HARD FOR HIM, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS HARD FOR MY GRANDPA, BECAUSE, AGAIN, IT'S FAMILY. AND YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD NOTHING BUT GREAT MEMORIES ABOUT SCRANTON. CLIMBING WHAT USED TO BE THAT 10 FOOT STONE WALL IN MARYWOOD, HAVING FIGHTS BEHIND THE WALL. CLIMBING THE FLAGPOLE AT MALONEY FIELD. MY GENERATION , GOING DOWN TO THE MATINEES AND PLAYING UP THE MATINEE ON THE WAY HOME, TRYING TO WALK ACROSS THAT PIPE ACROSS THE LUCKY , THE LACKEY, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE HEROES DID, SOMETIMES FALLING IN. THEY ARE NOTHING BUT GOOD MEMORIES, BUT MORE THAN A MEMORIES, WHAT I REMEMBER MOST AS , THAT I THINK ABOUT AS I GET OLDER IS THE VALUES THAT WERE INSTILLED IN ME UP HERE. THE POINT OF ALL OF THIS AS I LOOK BACK ON IT IS THIS IS WHERE I LEARNED ABOUT LOYALTY. THIS IS WHERE I LEARNED ABOUT PATRIOTISM. THIS IS WHERE I LEARNED ABOUT WHAT FRIENDSHIP MEANS. THIS IS WHERE I LEARNED ABOUT FAMILY AND FAITH. FAITH THAT HELPED ME GET THROUGH A LOT OF TOUGH TIMES IN MY LIFE , AND A LOT OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH TOUGHER TIMES THAN I HAVE. THE PHILOSOPHER KIERKEGAARD SAID \"FAITH SEES BEST IN THE DARK.\" WELL, WE ALL GO THROUGH DARK TIMES. BECAUSE OF THE FAITH INSTILLED IN ME HERE, WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TRAVERSE IT. WHEN MY DAD MADE THAT WALK UP THE STAIRS, HE TOLD ME, \"HONEY, EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OK ONCE WE GET SETTLED IN DELAWARE. WE ARE ALL GOING TO COME DOWN AND BE TOGETHER.\" AND IT WAS. MY DAD THEN, IN THE MID-1950'S, BELIEVED EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE OK, BECAUSE THE MIDDLE CLASS STILL HAD A FIGHTING CHANCE. , A FIGHTING CHANCE THEN. WE MOVED TO CLAYMONT, DELAWARE. THAT IS NO LONGER A STEEL TOWN. WE RENTED APARTMENTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE FINALLY GOT TO MOVE INTO A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD NOT FAR FROM THERE, SUBURBAN WILMINGTON. WHEN THE DEVELOPMENTS WERE BEING DEVELOPED, THREE-BEDROOM, SPLIT-LEVEL HOUSE IN A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD, WITH FOUR KIDS IN , AND AS I SAID, A RELATIVE. BUT FROM THAT TIME WHEN WE WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LISTEN, ANYTIME SOMEONE, A RELATIVE IN DELAWARE OR A FRIEND, LOST A JOB, OR A NEIGHBOR LOST A JOB BECAUSE OF RECESSION OR BECAUSE THE COMPANY WENT UNDER, MY DAD USED TO SAY, AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD TO THIS, HE WOULD SAY, \"JOEY, REMEMBER, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN YOUR PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT IS ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS ABOUT WHO YOU ARE. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY IT IS GOING TO BE OK, AND MEAN IT.\" THAT'S HOW WE WERE RAISED. MY GUESS IS THAT'S HOW MOST OF YOU WERE RAISED HERE IN SCRANTON. WE WERE RAISED TO BELIEVE FAMILY, LOYALTY, TREATING EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY IS WHAT WE SHOULD DO. BECAUSE A LOT OF US KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE NOT TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY BY PEOPLE WITH WEALTH, BY PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT WE WEREN'T QUITE THEIR EQUALS. I CAN HEAR HER NOW, MY MOM. I USED TO STUTTER BADLY WHEN I WAS A KID. SHE WOULD SAY, \"REMEMBER, JOEY, NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU, BUT EVERYBODY IS YOUR EQUAL.\" MY DAD WOULD SAY, NOT A JOKE, \"JOEY, THE MEASURE OF SUCCESS IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN. IT'S HOW QUICKLY YOU GET UP, SO GET THE HELL UP, MY DAD, AS HE GOT OLDER, HE WOULD BE ANGRY IF I DIDN'T CALL HIM, BECAUSE HE HAD TO MAKE SURE HE HAD A SPORT COAT ON TO MEET YOU. HE WANTED TO GREET YOU AT HIS HOME. MY DAD WAS MANNERS, TO MY DAD, WERE A BIG DEAL. ONE DAY HE WAS OVER AT OUR HOUSE, THE HOUSE I HAD BUILT, AND I GUESS I WAS LOOKING OUT OVER THIS POND IT'S ON IN DELAWARE, AND I GUESS I WAS KIND OF FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF. I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY DECEASED WIFE, AND HE SAID, \"JOEY, COME ON.\" HE LEFT AND WENT UP TO THE HALLMARK STORE AND CAME BACK. I HAVE IT ON MY DESK TO THIS DAY, A CARD. A CARD, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GO IN THAT STORE AND GET A GLASS, RECTANGULAR CASE WITH A CARTOON. ORY SAYING ON IT, OR SOMETHING. HE CAME BACK AND IS ME THIS CARTOON. I HAVE THIS CARTOON AND IT SITS ON MY DESK. IT'S BEEN THERE FOR OVER 25 YEARS. THAT'S NOT TRUE, 19 YEARS. I'M NOT A BIG FUNNY PAPER GUY, BUT MY DAD WAS. THERE'S A CARTOON CHARACTER THAT USED TO BE CALLED \"HAGAR THE HORRIBLE,\" A VIKING. THERE ARE TWO FRAMES IN THIS PICTURE. AGAIN, IT REMINDS ME OF THE RESILIENCE OF THE PEOPLE IN SCRANTON AND CLAYMONT. IT'S A PICTURE OF HAGAR, AND THE , AND HIS VIKING SHIP IS CRASHED ON THE ROCKS. THE MAST IS DOWN. HE'S STANDING AND SHAKING HIS FIST TO HEAVEN AND SAYING, \"WHY ME, GOD?\" AND A VOICE FROM HEAVEN, THE SAME SCENE WITH HIS HAND UP AND THE VOICE FROM HEAVEN SAYS, \"WHY NOT? WHY NOT YOU? WHY NOT YOU?\" FOLKS, A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE IN SCRANTON AND ALL ACROSS AMERICA HAVE, OVER THE LAST DECADES AND EVEN NOW, HAD TO MAKE THAT LONGEST WALK. BUT TODAY, TOO MANY MIDDLE-CLASS AND WORKING-CLASS FOLKS CAN'T LOOK THEIR KIDS IN THE EYE ANY LONGER AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE OK, AND MEAN IT. THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING. I'M RUNNING TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY IS THE MIDDLE CLASS. YOU KNOW, IN THIS TIME , [APPLAUSE] AND THIS TIME, WE HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG, REGARDLESS OF YOUR RACE, YOUR ETHNICITY, YOUR DISABILITY, YOUR GENDER. EVERYBODY'S GOT TO COME ALONG. [APPLAUSE] AND THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. AND ALL THIS TALK , I DID AN INTERVIEW FOR \"60 MINUTES\" THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING ON, \"60 MINUTES\" FOR 90 MINUTES. [LAUGHTER] THEY SAY, WELL, UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN. YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO YOUR OLD NEIGHBORHOODS. ASK THEM HOW THEY ARE DOING, HOW THEY ARE FEELING. THEY ARE IN TROUBLE. THERE USED TO BE A BARGAIN IN AMERICA, THAT IF YOU CONTRIBUTED, YOU GOT TO SHARE THE BENEFITS. THAT BARGAIN HAS BEEN BROKEN. CORPORATE AMERICA HAS BEEN DOING INCREDIBLY WELL FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS. THEIR PROFITS HAVE GONE UP EXPONENTIALLY. IT USED TO BE THERE WAS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SO-CALLED PRODUCTIVITY, HOW MUCH MORE GOT PUT OUT ON THE FACTORY FLOOR, AND SALARY. , OR OUT OF A CORPORATION, AND SALARY. FROM THE END OF WORLD WAR II TO THE END OF THE 1970'S, PRODUCTIVITY WENT UP OVER 90%. 94%, I THINK IT WAS. WAGES WENT UP 95%. SINCE THEN, PRODUCTIVITY HAS GONE UP 68% OR 69%. WAGES, 8%. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT BARGAIN? IT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE. STUDIES SHOW THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES HAVE DIFFICULTY. , DIFFICULTY MAKING, AND ARE LOSING HOPE. YOU ARE RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU WORKED HARD, YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF THAN YOUR PARENTS, BUT NOT TODAY, THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT. STUDIES SHOW THAT IF YOU HAVE AN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE OF $400 OR MORE, YOU CAN'T PAY IT. YOU HAVE TO EITHER BORROW THE MONEY OR SELL SOMETHING. , LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN BY MIDDLE-CLASS. A LOT OF ECONOMISTS WILL TELL YOU, MIDDLE-CLASS IS $51,800. MIDDLE-CLASS IS A VALUE SET. MIDDLE-CLASS IS BEING ABLE TO SEND YOUR CHILD TO THE PARK AND KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO COME HOME SAFELY. BEING ABLE TO SEND THEM TO THE LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL, WHERE YOU KNOW IF THEY DO WELL, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GO BEYOND SCHOOL. [APPLAUSE] MIDDLE-CLASS IS BEING ABLE TO TAKE YOUR GERIATRIC MOM HOME WHEN DAD DIES AND HOPE YOUR CHILDREN NEVER HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. THAT'S MIDDLE-CLASS. JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BREATHING ROOM. IT'S HARD FOR A FAMILY TODAY TO MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNITY IF THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE. I CAN'T IMAGINE TURNING TO YOUR CHILD WHO HAS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND SAYING, \"SORRY, KID. NOTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU. I CAN'T HELP YOU.\" LOOK, THE SAME WITH INSURANCE. LOOK, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE FOR PEOPLE. MANY OF YOU KNOW IT, AND MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO CANCER, OR HAD CANCER YOURSELF. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE LOST A CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER, A SON OR DAUGHTER, A LOVED ONE OR WIFE? I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE WHEN MY SON BEAU, A VETERAN, VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO IRAQ AND WAS THERE FOR A YEAR , A BRONZE STAR, COMES HOME AND GETS DIAGNOSED WITH TERMINAL CANCER. I CAN'T IMAGINE LYING IN THAT BED TOWARDS THE END WHEN THE INSURANCE COMPANY COULD HAVE COME IN AND SAY, \"YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR COVERAGE.\" I CAN'T FATHOM IT. HOW CAN A FAMILY MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNITY IF THEY HAVE A CHILD WITH SOME TALENT THAT ONCE TO GO , THAT WANTS TO GO BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL, AND THEY CAN'T GET THERE? MY DAD, WHEN WE GOT TO DELAWARE, THE FIRST GOOD JOB HE WAS ABLE TO GET AFTER SEVERAL YEARS ENDED UP BEING MANAGEMENT AT AN AUTOMOBILE DEALERSHIP. THE GREAT THING ABOUT THAT IS, YOU ALWAYS GET A NEW CAR FOR THE PROM. [LAUGHTER] I REMEMBER GOING DOWN AFTER A BASEBALL GAME. THE DEALERSHIP HE RAN WAS DOWN WHERE THE UNIVERSITY IS IN NO WORK , NEWARK, AND WE LIVED ABOUT 25 MINUTES FROM THERE. I WENT TO A SCHOOL IN CLAYMONT AT THE TIME. I REMEMBER GOING DOWN IN MY BASEBALL UNIFORM, RACING DOWN IN A 1951 PLYMOUTH CONVERTIBLE WITH A RIPPED TOP AND BEACH TOWELS FOR SEAT COVERS. I WOULD PARK IT IN ONE SPOT, RUN , I RAN IN AND ASKED THE SECRETARY, \"WHERE'S DAD?\" I WAS GOING TO GET A CAR TO GO TO THE SENIOR PROM. SHE SAID, \"HE'S OUT IN THE ALLEY. GO ON INTO THE SHOP.\" MY DAD WAS PACING BACK AND FORTH. TRUE STORY. HE LOOKED UP AND SAID, \"JOEY, I'M SO SORRY. SO DAMN SORRY.\" THIS IS BEFORE CELL PHONES. I THOUGHT MAYBE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY MOM. HE SAID, \"I WENT TO THE BANK TO FINANCE ALL THE CAR LOANS THEY HAD. I SPOKE TO CHARLIE, THE VICE PRESIDENT. THEY WON'T LEND ME THE MONEY TO GET YOU TO COLLEGE. I'M SO DAMN ASHAMED.\" I'M ASHAMED.\" WHY WOULD HE BE ASHAMED? , \"I'M ASHAMED.\" WHY WOULD HE BE ASHAMED? HOW MANY PEOPLE SAT AT THEIR KITCHEN TABLE TODAY AND HAD THE CONVERSATION SAYING, YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT TO DRIVE ON THOSE TIRES FOR ANOTHER 10,000 MILES. WE CAN'T AFFORD A NEW SET OF TIRES THIS MONTH. WE'VE GOT TO WAIT. WHO'S GOING TO TELL HER, SHE CAN COME BACK? WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THE INSURANCE? THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS NO IDEA WHAT HARD-WORKING, DECENT, ORDINARY AMERICANS ARE GOING THROUGH. YOU KNOW, A PARENT , HOW MANY OF YOU, MOMS OR DADS, GRANDPAS ARE GRANDMAS , OR GRANDMAS, DROP OFF YOUR CHILD OR GRANDCHILD THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL, PRESCHOOL, FIRST, SECOND, THIRD OR FOURTH GRADE IN AMERICA, HAVING TO LEARN HOW TO DUCK AND COVER? TELLING KIDS, YOU GET BEHIND THIS PILLAR HERE IF SOMEONE COMES IN. YOU KNOW, THE GREATEST CONCERN , I SPOKE TO THE INTERNATIONAL PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION IN LONDON. YOU KNOW THE GENERATION THAT HAS THE GREATEST DEGREE OF ANXIETY OF ANY GENERATION IN AMERICA? KIDS BETWEEN SEVEN AND 20 YEARS OLD. YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR GREATEST FEAR IS? BEING SHOT IN SCHOOL. NO, NOT A JOKE. BEING SHOT IN SCHOOL. YOU SAW ALL OF THE PICTURES OF GOING BACK TO SCHOOL ABOUT KIDS AT THE NEW SCHOOLS WE ARE BUILDING. THAT'S ALL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE NERVE TO TAKE ON THE DAMN NRA AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS. THERE IS NO NEED , [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, THERE'S NO NEED FOR THIS. SOME OF YOU ARE HUNTERS. I'VE GOT SHOTGUNS. MY SONS ARE HUNTERS. MAINLY GEESE. YOU KNOW, IF YOU GO OUT AND HUNT FOR GEESE, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE IN YOUR SHOTGUN MORE THAN THREE SHELLS. TO PROTECT THE GEESE. WE HAVE FEDERAL LAWS THAT PROTECT GEESE. THINK ABOUT IT. WHY IN GOD'S NAME SHOULD ANYONE BE ABLE TO HAVE A CLIP THAT HOLDS 100 ROUNDS? [APPLAUSE] SO FOLKS, THE ADMINISTRATION KEEPS DOING THE BIDDING OF THE NRA AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT AGAINST THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THE SECOND AMENDMENT SAYS IT'S NOT ABSOLUTE. MY FRIENDS ON THE FAR RIGHT TALK ABOUT THE TREE OF LIBERTY IS WATERED WITH THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS. YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. GUESS WHAT? YOU NEED AN M1 TANK. YOU NEED AN F-15. YOU NEED SOME HELLFIRE MISSILES. BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM. YOU CAN'T HAVE BAZOOKAS. YOU CAN'T HAVE MACHINE GUNS. WE HAVE NEVER ARGUED THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN WEAPONS PEOPLE CAN'T OWN. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT WHEN WE SAID ANYBODY CAN OWN A WEAPON, ANYBODY. FOLKS, HOW CAN A PARENT FEEL GOOD ABOUT RAISING A CHILD IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE GROUNDWATER IS POLLUTED BECAUSE OF OIL COMPANIES POLLUTING IT? OR WHETHER OR NOT THE GROUNDWATER PIPES ARE PUT IN IN , ARE MADE OF WOOD OR WERE PUT IN IN 1960 AND ARE NO LONGER SAFE? HOW MANY SCHOOLS AROUND THE COUNTRY, FOR ALL I KNOW HERE IN LUZERN COUNTY, THE WATER IN THE SCHOOLS IS NOT SAFE? LOOK, WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING. A FAIR SHOT, A LIFE OF DIGNITY, AND THE PEACE OF MIND THAT WHEN SOMEONE GETS SICK, YOU HAVE A LITTLE BREATHING ROOM WHEN THE BILL COMES THROUGH? A SHOT FOR A BETTER FUTURE. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, AND I'VE NEVER TALKED ABOUT A PRESIDENT LIKE THIS, I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP IS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING THAT. HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY SENSE OF EMPATHY AT ALL FOR PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] I'VE NOT SEEN IT, IF IT EXISTS. UNLIKE ANY OTHER PRESIDENT THAT I'VE EVER WORKED WITH. AND FOLKS, I'M NOT SURE DONALD TRUMP HAS ANY IDEA WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE LONGEST WALK. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THE LONGEST WALK HIS FATHER EVER MADE WAS THE DROP-OFF FOR $100 MILLION IN HIS TRUST ACCOUNT. [APPLAUSE] BUT LOOK, LET ME TELL YOU WHY I'M RUNNING. FIRST, THINKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE. NINE YEARS AGO, WE FOUGHT LIKE HELL TO GET OBAMACARE PASSED. GENERATIONS HAVE TRIED TO DO THAT. WE GOT IT DONE. HEALTH CARE IS MORE THAN JUST A LUXURY RESERVED FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. IT'S A RIGHT. IT'S A RIGHT WE ALL DESERVE. [APPLAUSE] IT GOES TO OUR DIGNITY AND WHO WE WANT TO BE AS A COUNTRY. ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS IN THOSE YEARS OF STANDING ALONGSIDE PRESIDENT OBAMA. GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT TO GET THAT DONE. IT WAS A REALLY BIG DEAL. I WISH I HAD NOT WHISPERED THAT IN THE PRESIDENT'S EAR. THANK GOD MY MOTHER WAS NOT AROUND. UNDER MY PLAN, YOU ARE FREE TO STICK WITH THE INSURANCE YOU HAVE. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU GET TO SIGN UP FOR A PUBLIC OPTION, A MEDICARE-LIKE PROPOSAL. MY PLAN REDUCES PREMIUMS, DEDUCT WILL, OUT-OF-POCKET COST. FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT WILL FORCE PRIVATE INSURANCE TO COMPETE WITH YOUR BUSINESS, NOT JUST WITH EACH OTHER, BUT WITH A PUBLIC COMPETITOR. THAT IS WHAT THE MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION PROVIDES. IT WILL KEEP PREMIUMS EVEN LOWER. BOTTOM LINE IS MY HEALTH CARE PLAN IS THE FASTEST, MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE COST FOR AMERICANS NOT IN FIVE YEARS, NOT IN 10 YEARS, BUT RIGHT NOW, AND WE CAN AFFORD IT. [APPLAUSE] THE SECOND THING, WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. AS WAS STATED AT THE BEGINNING BY ROSEMARY , YOU KNOW, MY WIFE, WHO TAUGHT HER WHOLE LIFE IS TEACHING AT THIS MOMENT. THAT IS WHY SHE'S NOT UP HERE WITH ME. SHE'S GOING TO IOWA TOMORROW, BUT SHE'S IN THE CLASSROOM TODAY TEACHING. SHE SAID IT BEST , ANY COUNTRY THAT OUT EDUCATES US WILL OUTCOMPETE US. IT IS A BASIC THING. [APPLAUSE] IN THE 21ST CENTURY, DOES ANYBODY THINK 12 YEARS OF EDUCATION IS ENOUGH TO GET YOU TO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN IT? I DID A STUDY FOR THE PRESIDENT. HE ASKED YOU TO DO A STUDY ON JOBS IN THE FUTURE. SIX IN 10 JOBS AT THIS MOMENT REQUIRE SOMETHING BEYOND A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE. SIX IN 10. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD HAS ACCESS TO A GOOD EDUCATION, REGARDLESS OF THE ZIP CODE. THAT'S WHY MY PLAN TRIPLES TITLE I FUNDING FOR AT RISK SCHOOLS. WE CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT. IT MEANS EVERY CHILD WILL HAVE ACCESS TO UNIVERSAL PRE-K AND PRE-K UNIVERSALLY , X FINANCIALLY INCREASES , EXPONENTIALLY INCREASES THE CHANCE THE CHILD WILL MAKE IT THROUGH SCHOOL WITHOUT GETTING IN TROUBLE. IT MEANS WE WILL FIND AND PAY TEACHERS THE SALARY THEY DESERVE. TEACHERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS GRADUATING FROM SCHOOL, THEY GRADUATE WITH A FOUR-YEAR DEGREE AND GET PAID LESS THAN ANYBODY ELSE GRADUATING AS A STARTING AND FINISHING SALARY. LOOK, THE WORK WE DO IS OF EXTREME NATIONAL IMPORTANCE. THEIR SALARIES REFLECT THAT. WE KNOW THE 21ST CENTURY, AS I SAID, 12 YEARS IS NOT ENOUGH. UNDER MY PLAN, EVERYONE WHO QUALIFIES TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE WILL BE ABLE TO GO FOR FREE. [APPLAUSE] YOU SAY, THERE GOES THAT BEEN SPIT , THAT BIG SPENDING DEMOCRAT, RIGHT? GUESS WHAT, PEOPLE WHO GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL ARE HAVING A GO BACK TO SCHOOL FOR RETRAINING BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY ELIMINATING JOBS. THERE ARE $1.6 TRILLION IN LOOPHOLES IN THE TAX-CUT , TAX CODE. YOU GET A DEDUCTION FOR RACEHORSES. ELIMINATE ONE OF THEM. IT'S CALLED STEPPED UP BASIS. YOU ARE ABOUT TO GO AND CASH IN A CAPITAL GAIN. YOU FIGURE YOU GET HIT BY A CAR OR TRUCK, YOU LOSE YOUR LIFE, IT GOES TO YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER, THEY DON'T PAY A CENT. GUESS WHAT? THAT COSTS $17 BILLION A YEAR. ELIMINATE THAT ONE LOOPHOLE AND IT COULD PUT EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY PERSON AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHO IS QUALIFIED. INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY IN THIS COUNTRY , [APPLAUSE] YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GETTING CRUSHED BY THE BURDEN OF STUDENT DEBT. MANY OF YOUR PARENTS ARE AS WELL. IF YOU ARE PAYING BACK STUDENT LOANS THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT, MY PLAN IS TO CUT YOUR PAYMENTS IN HALF. THE WAY YOU DO IT, IF YOU GET OUT OF SCHOOL, YOU'RE MAKING LESS THAN $25 A YEAR TO START WITH, YOU DON'T PAY ANYTHING BACK. NO INTEREST ACCRUES. IF YOU MAKE MORE THAN THAT, YOU WILL ONLY PAY 5% OF YOUR DISPOSABLE INCOME MEANING AFTER ALL YOUR BILLS ARE PAID AND ALL YOUR COST OF LIVING IS TAKEN CARE OF. POLICE OFFICERS, COUNSELING VICTIMS, THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE, ANYTHING INVOLVING PUBLIC SERVICE, YOU GET $10,000 A YEAR THAT YOU WORK OFF YOUR DEBT UP TO $50,000 AND AFTER 10 YEARS OF DOING IT, YOU HAVE NO DEBT AT ALL. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. BY THE WAY, COMMUNITY COLLEGE , YOU KNOW, EVERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THIS STATE, IF YOU DO WELL, YOU GET TO GO ON TO A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE. ALL THOSE CREDITS ARE TRANSFERABLE TO A FOUR-YEAR STATE SCHOOL. YOU HAVE SOME GREAT SCHOOLS IN THIS COUNTRY. PENN STATE IS NOT DOING BAD, ARE THEY? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF YOU ARE GOING TO RESTORE THE MIDDLE CLASS, WE NEED TO START REWARDING WORK AGAIN, NOT JUST WEALTH. UNDER THE REPUBLICAN AND TRUMP PLAN, WE ONLY REWARD WEALTH. DONALD TRUMP INHERITED A STRONG ECONOMY FROM BARACK AND ME. THINGS WERE BEGINNING TO REALLY MOVE. AND JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HE INHERITED, HE'S IN THE MIDST OF SQUANDERING IT. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH, REFLECTS OUR VALUES, AND THAT IS GOING TO START , I'M GOING TO START BY REVERSING THE TRUMP TAX CUTS FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS. [APPLAUSE] WEALTHY DID NOT NEED THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE AND CORPORATIONS HAVE SPENT THEM ON STOCK BUYBACKS TO GIVE BENEFITS TO THEIR STOCKHOLDERS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, TO THEIR CEO'S. IT USED TO BE WHEN REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT, THE AVERAGE CEO OF FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES MADE 36 OR 37 TIMES WHAT THE AVERAGE EMPLOYEE MADE FROM VICE PRESIDENT ALL THE WAY DOWN. KNOW WHAT IT IS TODAY? OVER 420 TIMES AS MUCH. WHAT HAPPENED? AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, WHO DIED AND LEFT HIM BOSS? [LAUGHTER] NO, I'M SERIOUS. I THINK CORPORATIONS CAN DO A LOT OF GOOD THINGS, BUT THEY DON'T NEED THAT TAX-CUT. WE WILL RAISE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO PUT IT ON EDUCATION, CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THE REST. I'M GETTING RID OF THE SUPER WEALTHY TAX LOOPHOLES, DOUBLING THEIR CAPITAL GAINS. RIGHT NOW, IF YOU ARE A FIREMAN AND A SCHOOLTEACHER, OR YOU WORK AS A POLICE OFFICER OR NURSE, YOU PAY AT A HIGHER TAX RATE THAN SOMEONE MAKING $10 MILLION A YEAR. HIGHER TAX RATE. WHY IS THAT? IT MAKES NO SENSE. WHY SHOULD THE CAPITAL GAIN BE AT 21%, AND EVEN THEN, MOST DON'T PAY THAT. EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY PERSON, OUR CAPITAL GAINS WILL BE TREATED LIKE REAL INCOME AND THEY WILL PAY 40% ON THEIR CAPITAL GAINS. IT IS A BASIC BARGAIN TO REBUILD A STRONGER INCLUSIVE MIDDLE CLASS. [APPLAUSE] AND IT DOES NOT AFFECT ANY GAINS ON YOUR HOME AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT YOU IN FACT ARE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. LOOK, WE'VE GOT TO STOP THIS AWFUL GUN VIOLENCE THAT'S RIPPING US APART. THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST FEARS CHILDREN ARE FACING. WE CANNOT LIVE WITH OURSELVES UNTIL WE TAKE IT ON. I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THE UNITED STATES HAS EVER TAKEN ON THE NRA NATIONALLY AND BEATEN THEM AND BEATEN THEM TWICE. [APPLAUSE] SUCCEEDED IN BANNING ASSAULT WEAPONS FOR 10 YEARS AND LIMITING THE SIZE OF MAGAZINES. HOW MANY CARTRIDGES CAN BE IN A MAGAZINE. I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO GET IT DONE, AND I CAN DO IT AGAIN. WE HAVE TO CONFRONT THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IT IS THE ISSUE FACING THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 15% OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEMS. WE HAVE TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE, AND I'VE LAID OUT A PLAN WHERE WE GET TO NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050 AND BETWEEN NOW AND 2030, WE MAKE SUCH DRAMATIC CHANGE THAT IT CANNOT BE TURNED AROUND, BUT 85% OF THE PROBLEM COMES FROM BEYOND OUR BORDERS. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN MARSHAL THOSE OTHER NATIONS TO CONFRONT THE GREATEST THREAT WE'VE EVER SEEN TO HUMANITY. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. IT'S REAL. [APPLAUSE] IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF MY PRESIDENCY, I WILL INVITE THE OTHER NATIONS THAT ARE PART OF THIS TO WASHINGTON, D.C., SO THEY UP THE ANTE OF WHAT THEY PROMISED THEY WILL DO AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE LOST THE RESPECT OF NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD BY THE WAY THIS PRESIDENT HAS ACTED. CLIMATE IS NOT JUST AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. HANDLED RIGHT, IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY. WE'RE THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD CONFRONTED WITH A REAL SERIOUS PROBLEM. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO TAKE IT AND TURN IT INTO AN OPPORTUNITY. THAT IS WHO WE ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE CAN BUILD A NETWORK OF CHARGING STATIONS ACROSS AMERICA MOVED TO , AND MOVE TO ALL-ELECTRIC VEHICLES. WE HAVE AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR STANDARDS FOR BUILDINGS, CARS, POWER GRIDS. WE ARE GOING TO SAVE YOU MONEY, SAVE YOU OPPORTUNITY, AND ALLOW YOU TO BREATHE CLEANER. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AN HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY, INVESTING $400 BILLION IN THE INDUSTRIES OF THE FUTURE SO WE BECOME A NET EXPORTER OF ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY, CREATING LITERALLY MILLIONS OF JOBS. IT WILL CREATE MORE THAN 10 MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS, UNION JOBS MAKING 40 BUCKS AN HOUR, NOT 15 BUCKS AN HOUR. FOR REAL. THIS IS THE PROJECTION. [APPLAUSE] THE THINGS I'M TALKING ABOUT, THESE ARE BIG CHALLENGES BUT NO BIGGER THAN OUR CAPACITY AS AMERICANS, SO WE HAVE TO GET STARTED THINKING BIG AGAIN, THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE WE CAN BUILD. AMERICANS ARE DOING THEIR PART. THEY ARE OUT THERE WORKING HARD EVERY DAY. THEY DESERVE THEIR LEADERS TO WORK AS HARD FOR THEM. WE DO NOT DESERVE A DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT CRUSADES AGAINST PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WE DO NOT DESERVE A DEPARTMENT OF LABOR THAT PUTS CORPORATE PROFITS AGAINST , AHEAD OF WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE. WE DON'T DESERVE A FOREIGN POLICY WASTE ON LIES, CONSPIRACY THEORIES, AND ABANDONMENT. , FOREIGN POLICY BASED ON LIES, CONSPIRACY THEORIES, AND ABANDONMENT. [APPLAUSE] MOST OF ALL, WE DO NOT DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO MAKE LIFE IN AMERICA HARDER, CRUELER, PETTY OR. HE SAID WE HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE FORGOTTEN AMERICAN. THE AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS BRINGS DIGNITY AND INTEGRITY EVERY DAY TO WORK. THEY DESERVE DIGNITY AND INTEGRITY REFLECTED IN THEIR LEADERS. THE CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE REALLY SERIOUS. I STAND HERE MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN I WAS WHEN I GOT ELECTED AS A 29-YEAR-OLD KID TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. I WASN'T OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. I HAD TO WAIT DAYS TO BE ELIGIBLE. I WAS CHARACTERIZED AS A YOUNG, IDEALISTIC GUY WHO WAS OPTIMISTIC. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO RESTORE OUR BACKBONE OF THIS NATION. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO THE HELL WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NEVER , THINK ABOUT IT. [APPLAUSE] I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN I'VE EVER BEEN IN MY CAREER IF WE MOVE THIS ADMINISTRATION OUT OF THE WAY. WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS IN THE WORLD. OUR WORKERS ARE THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS A MATTER OF FACT THAN THEY ARE IN ASIA. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN PENNSYLVANIA AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THAN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED , THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. EVERY MAJOR LIFE-CHANGING THING HAS COME OUT OF A RESEARCH UNIVERSITY MONETIZED BY CORPORATE AMERICA, BUT IT HAS COME OUT OF RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES YOU OWN, IF IT'S LOS ALAMOS OR ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WHY IN GOD NAME WOULD WE WALK AROUND WITH OUR HEADS DOWN. WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD , NO HYPERBOLE , AND WE HAVE LEAD THE WORLD NOT JUST BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER BUT THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, AND IT IS BEING ERODED. THE EMBRACE OF DICTATORS AND THUGS, KIM JONG-UN, LOVE LETTERS . THE GUY WHO HAD HIS UNCLE'S BRAIN FALLING OUT SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE, HAD HIS BROTHER ASSASSINATED IN AN AIRPORT. PUTIN, WHO I KNOW RELATIVELY WELL , I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HIM , PRUDEN WHO HAS NOTHING IN MIND OTHER THAN TO BREAK UP NATO, REDUCE OUR INFLUENCE AROUND THE WORLD. THE ONE THING HE FEARS IS OUR INFLUENCE AROUND THE WORLD. THE ONE THING HE FEARS, POKING FINGERS IN THE EYE, TREATING NATO LIKE IT'S A PROTECTION RACKET. YOU SAW WHAT JUST HAPPEN. I'VE BEEN ALL THROUGH THAT PART OF THE WORLD WHERE THE KURDS ARE. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN TURKEY, SIGNIFICANT MANNER TIME IN A RACK IN THAT WHOLE AREA, SYRIA. WHAT HAVE WE JUST DONE? HAVE YOU FOUND A SINGLE MILITARY PERSON WHO DOESN'T FEEL LIKE WE HAVE JUST BESMIRCHED AMERICA'S REPUTATION AROUND THE WORLD OF BEING RELIABLE? 10,000 KURDS DIED , DIED , DEFEATING ISIS. CAPTURING 10,000 ISIS TERRORISTS IN PRISON OR THE PRESIDENT ON A WHIM, WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF ANY OF HIS MILITARY COMMANDERS, DECIDES HE'S GOING TO MAKE A DEAL WITH ERDOGAN, WHO I KNOW WELL, TO MOVE HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN TROOPS WHO ARE TRAINERS FOR THE KURDS AND ISIS FORCES. YOU SEE ON TELEVISION, WOMEN STANDING THERE HOLDING THEIR CHILDREN, UNDER BOMBARDMENT WHEN OUR TANKS ARE MOVING OUT. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? WHAT'S GOING ON? WHO'S GOING TO BELIEVE AMERICA'S WORD AS WE GIVE IT? THAT IS WHAT A PRESIDENT DOES, . HE SPEAKS FOR AMERICA. HE KEEPS COMMITMENTS. WHEN THEY SAILED AS PRISONERS ARE GOING TO ESCAPE, HE SAYS, \"WELL, THEY ARE ONLY GOING TO GO TO EUROPE. THEY WILL NOT COME TO THE UNITED STATES.\" THAT'S GREAT, ISN'T IT? FOLKS, LOOK, THERE'S NOT A THING WE CANNOT DO. WE ARE BETTER POSITIONED THAN ANYONE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. WE CAN DO IT IN A REASONABLE AND QUICK WAY. WE CAN UNITE THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE, FOLKS, I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE , DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS , WALKING AROUND WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN LIKE \"WOE IS ME.\" FOLKS, THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. STAND UP. TAKE IT BACK. WE CAN, IN FACT, DO ANYTHING WE SET OUR MIND TO. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS ON THE MOVE, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT, IN THIS VITALLY IMPORTANT BATTLE GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY. THAT'S GOOD SOUTH SIDE. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE NOT FROM SOUTH SIDE, WELCOME TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF DES MOINES. [APPLAUSE] OR, AS THE REST OF US LIKE TO CALL IT, GOD'S COUNTRY. [LAUGHTER] YOU ARE PART OF A FAMILY WHEN YOU ARE IN THE SOUTH SIDE. BECAUSE WE ON THE SOUTH SIDE ARE A WORKING CLASS FAMILY. WE ARE A WORKING-CLASS FAMILY THAT BELIEVES THAT IF YOU WORK HARD FOR A LIVING, IF YOU PLAY BY THE RULES, IF YOU DO WHAT'S RIGHT, YOU DESERVE A LITTLE DIGNITY IN YOUR LIFE. WE ARE A DIVERSE FAMILY WITH ITALIANS LIVING NEXT IRISH, TO LATINOS, NEXT TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS, NEXT TO GAZE, NEXT TO STRAITS, IMMIGRANTS, , STRAIGHTS, IMMIGRANTS, NATURAL BORN CITIZENS. WE ARE A FAMILY THAT BELIEVES THIS DIVERSITY MAKES US A STRONGER FAMILY. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE A FAMILY THAT LOOKS OUT FOR EACH OTHER. WE MAY NOT GET ALONG ALL OF THE TIME, BUT BY GOD WE WILL MAKE SURE OUR NEIGHBORS ARE CARED FOR AND LOOKED OUT FOR. WE MAY FIGHT A LITTLE BIT, BUT, BY GOD, IF YOU COME AFTER US, WE ARE COMING AFTER YOU ENFORCE. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IF YOU TAKE ON ONE OF US, YOU ARE TAKING ON ALL OF US. SO WELCOME TO THE SOUTH SIDE. BECAUSE THE SOUTH SIDE IS FAMILY. AND, THAT'S MEANS WE ARE ALL FAMILY. WE ALL HAVE VALUES. AND, WE ALL NEED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER. THIS IS THE AMERICA WE LEFT BEHIND. AND, THIS IS THE AMERICA THAT WE ARE GOING TO, AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO, MY MOTHER PASSED AWAY. MY WIFE, BETTY, AND I WERE IN MINNESOTA WITH HER FOR THE TWO WEEKS BEFORE SHE PASSED AWAY. THE NIGHT AFTER SHE PASSED, WE CAME BACK DOWN TO DES MOINES TO GET A CHANGE OF CLOTHES AND OUR FUNERAL CLOSE AND SLEEP IN OUR OWN BED FOR ONCE. THE NEXT MORNING, WE HAD TO BACK , HEADED BACK UP TO MINNESOTA. ON OUR WAY UP THERE, WE GOT A PHONE CALL, AND IT WAS A BLOCKED CALL SO I THOUGHT I WOULD WIN A FREE-TRADE TO , TRIP TO ORLANDO , FREE TRIP TO ORLANDO OR THE IRS IS AFTER ME. [LAUGHTER] I ANSWER THAT PHONE CALL AND IT WAS JOE BIDEN CALLING. THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TOOK TIME OUT OF HIS DAY TO MAKE SURE I WAS DOING ALL RIGHT, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FAMILY DOES FOR ONE ANOTHER. THAT'S WHAT AMERICA SHOULD BE DOING FOR ONE ANOTHER. THAT IS THE SOUL OF AMERICA. COMPARE THAT TO OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT. [LAUGHTER] [BOOING] WE DON'T DO THAT IN AMERICA. BUT, THAT'S WHY JOE BIDEN IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS NATION, TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY AND BRING THIS FAMILY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AS FAMILY AND AS AMERICANS. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP. NOW, TURN AWAY. [LAUGHTER] BUT THEN LOOK AT JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A LITTLE BETTER SIGHT, BUT THE STRANGE THING IS, PUTIN DOESN'T WANT JOE BIDEN TO BE PRESIDENT. AND DONALD TRUMP IS OBVIOUSLY SCARED TO RUN AGAINST HIM IN A GENERAL ELECTION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S BECAUSE JOE BIDEN, AND JOE BIDEN'S WORDS, WILL BEAT DONALD TRUMP LIKE A DRUM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND EVEN BETTER, ONCE JOE BIDEN IS ELECTED PRESIDENT, HE WILL BRING PETER SCHIFF TO THE WORLD STAGE. AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, A DIGNIFIED LEADERSHIP HERE AT HOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'VE KNOWN JOE BIDEN FOR OVER 10 YEARS NOW, AND I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING, HE IS WHAT HE IS. THAT MEANS IF JOE BIDEN TELLS YOU SOMETHING, YOU CAN TAKE IT TO THE BANK. YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT ALL OF THE TIME, BUT YOU WON'T HAVE MICK MULVANEY COMING OUT THE NEXT DAY SAYING THAT IS NOT WHAT HE SAID. [APPLAUSE] , [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIS WORD MEANS SOMETHING. HE IS A MAN OF INTEGRITY AND MORALS THAT HAVE BEEN A GUIDING FORCE THROUGH THIS WORLD FOR YEARS ON END, AND HE WILL BE A GUIDING FORCE THROUGH THIS WORLD AND COUNTRY IN ANOTHER YEAR. THAT'S WHAT A LEADER IS ALL ABOUT. I WOULD LIKE , UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, JOE BIDEN UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO STRUGGLE AND KEEP MOVING FORWARD AS A FAMILY AND AS AMERICA. HE KNOWS THE PROBLEMS OF EVERYDAY PEOPLE, AND THE PROBLEMS THEY FACE, AND AS PRESIDENT, HE WILL WORK TO CREATE A PATHWAY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND RESTORE THE FAMILY THAT IS AMERICA. THAT IS WHY I'M SO HONORED TO INTRODUCE MY FRIEND, MY HERO, AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT, FIRST LADY, AND FIRST GRANDCHILD. [LAUGHTER] OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, JOE BIDEN , JOE, JILL, AND NATALIE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHANTING] MRS. BIDEN THANK YOU, BRUCE , THANK YOU, BRUCE FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE. AS A TEACHER, I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR OUR STUDENTS. HOW MANY TEACHERS ARE IN THE AUDIENCE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THERE ARE MANY THINGS ABOUT MY HUSBAND'S CAREER THAT I'M PROUD OF. FROM THE BILLS HE PASSED IN THE SENATE TO TRULY CRITICAL WORK HE DID SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR EIGHT YEARS, ANTI-DEMAND IS JUSTICE FOR WOMEN THROUGH THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. HE STOOD UP TO THE NRA AND ONE TWICE , WON TWICE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE FOUGHT FOR THE FINAL VOTES TO GET THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PASSED AND HE LED THE EFFORT TO END CANCER AS WE KNOW IT. BUT, SO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT MAKE ME PROUDEST OF HIM WEREN'T COVERED BY THE NEWS OR AREN'T RECORDED IN THE CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY. FOR EXAMPLE, ONCE, WHEN JOE WAS MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE WEST WING ON THE WAY TO PREPARE FOR A MAJOR SPEECH, THERE WAS A TOUR GOING THROUGH. THEY TAKE TOURS THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE, AND SO HE STOPPED TO TALK TO THEM. ONE OF THE LITTLE BOYS WHO WAS ON THAT TOUR HAD A STUTTER. MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW JOE HAS A STUTTER , HAD A STUTTER WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG KID AS WELL. HE PULLED THE LITTLE BOY AND HIS MOM ASIDE AND HE INVITED THEM TO COME TO THE SPEECH PREP. FOR THE NEXT HOUR, HE TALKED TO HIM, THE LITTLE BOY, ABOUT HOW MUCH FEAR HE USED TO HAVE ABOUT HIS OWN IMPEDIMENT AND HOW HE LEARNED TO OVERCOME IT. HE SHOWED HIM HOW HE MARKED UP HIS SPEECH AND HOW HE USED RHYTHM AND MUSIC TO CONTROL THE CADENCE. HE ENCOURAGED HIM AND KEPT SAYING, YOU CAN DO IT, TOO. HE KEPT TELLING HIM HE BELIEVED IN HIM. THAT LITTLE BOY WASN'T , AND THAT THAT LITTLE BOY WAS NOT DEFINED BY HIS STUTTER. AND THAT IS NOT THE ONLY TIME HE DID SOMETHING LIKE THAT. JUST LIKE BRUCE SAID, JOE IS THE ONE WHO MAKES THE CALL. HE STOPS AND TAKES TIME WHEN HE SEES PEOPLE HURTING. HE FIGHTS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO FEEL LEFT OUT, AND EVEN AS VICE PRESIDENT, HE WAS NEVER, EVER TOO BUSY TO CALL A FRIEND OR MAKE A VISIT TO THE HOSPITAL. HIS KINDNESS, HIS CHARACTER, IT IS A PART OF EVERYTHING HE DOES. IT'S WHY HE WORKS SO HARD TO PASS THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN'S ACT , WOMEN ACT IN THE ACA. IT IS WHY HE HAS THE TAKE , HAS THE COURAGE TO TAKE ON THE NRA. IT'S WHY HE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR FAMILIES WHO NEED HELP WITH COLLEGE TUITION AND MEDICAL BILLS AND HOPE FOR BETTER JOBS. ABOUT A MONTH AGO, I WAS IN SEATTLE AND A WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SHE HAD TEARS IN HER EYES. I ALWAYS SORT OF BRACE FOR THAT, BECAUSE I KNOW OR I FEEL THEY ARE USUALLY SOMEONE WHO HAS LOST A CHILD OR IS SUFFERING WITH CANCER, SO I HAD TO BRACE MYSELF TO TALK TO THIS WOMAN, BUT HER STORY WAS NOT A SAD STORY. SHE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH GRATITUDE. HER SON HAD SUFFERED WITH A STUTTER ALL HIS LIFE, BUT HE HAD MET JOE, AND JOE KEPT IN TOUCH WITH HIM. HE CALLED HIM EVERY SO OFTEN AND, THINGS TO JOE'S ENCOURAGEMENT, HE BUILT UP HIS CONFIDENCE AND HE OVERCAME HIS FEARS OF FAILING. TO HER ASTONISHMENT, HER SON, JUST LIKE JOE, HAD CONQUERED HIS IMPEDIMENT, FOCUSED ON HIS STUDIES, AND IS NOW HEADED TO COLLEGE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN A TIME WHERE OUR NATION IS DROWNING IN CYNICISM AND CORRUPTION AND, LET'S FACE IT, CRUELTY, WE NEED A MAN LIKE JOE MORE THAN EVER. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST FEEL LIKE OR WHAT IT WOULD FEEL LIKE TO HAVE ALIKE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT WE CAN FEEL PROUD OF AGAIN? SO, PICTURE IT IS 2021, A MORNING LIKE THIS MORNING, A BEAUTIFUL FALL MORNING, YOU ARE SIPPING YOUR COFFEE, AND YOU PICK UP THE MORNING PAPER. THE HEADLINE ISN'T ABOUT SOME LATE NIGHT TWEET STORM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] INSTEAD, IT IS A STORY ABOUT CHILDREN WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM UNIVERSAL PRE -K. YOU TURN ON THE TELEVISION AND THE ANCHORS ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW WERE GOING TO BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND REPORTING THAT, FINALLY, SOMEONE IS STANDING UP TO THE NRA AND KEEPING OUR SCHOOLS AND CHILDREN SAFE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU CALL YOUR KIDS IN FROM THE OTHER ROOM, \"COME IN, COME IN, THE PRESIDENT IS ON THE TV.\" BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR CHILDREN HEAR WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS TO SAY. I PRESIDENT THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER, NOT TEARS FAMILIES APART. A PRESIDENT THAT BELIEVES OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US, AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS THE FUTURE THAT I WANT, AND I KNOW THAT'S THE FUTURE THAT YOU ALL WANT, TOO, BUT IT IS UP TO US, ALL OF US HERE IN THIS ROOM, YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR FAMILY, TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. WE HAVE TO STAND UP, WE HAVE TO SPEAK UP, WE HAVE TO SIGN COMMITMENT CARDS, AND YOU HAVE TO BRING YOUR FRIENDS OUT TO KNOCK ON DOORS, AND WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW. JOE LIKES TO TELL THE STORY OF HOW HE HAD TO ASK ME TO MARRY HIM FIVE TIMES. [LAUGHTER] BUT, THE TRUTH IS, I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM MANY MORE TIMES THAN THAT. AND OF COURSE, HE HAD TWO BEAUTIFUL BOYS, NATALIE'S DADDY AND HUNTER. I FEEL SO PROUD TO STAND BESIDE HIM, IN ALL OF THE ROLES HE'S PLAYED, FATHER, GRANDFATHER, SENATOR, VICE PRESIDENT, AND SOON, WITH YOUR HELP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, HONEY. I APPRECIATE IT. THIS IS A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN A PROFESSIONAL EDUCATOR FOR HER LIFE AND A PROFESSOR AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. BEFORE THAT, SHE TAUGHT HIGH SCHOOL. [LAUGHTER] ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS IS THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WAY WE WERE BOTH RAISED. WE BOTH COULD HAVE COME FROM THE SOUTH SIDE, NOT A JOKE. I WAS , I MAY BE IRISH BUT I'M NOT STUPID. [LAUGHTER] IT'S NOT A BAD COMBINATION. WE CAME FROM A SIMILAR NEIGHBORHOOD IN TWO DIFFERENT STATES, BUT I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR GRANDDAUGHTER. I HAVE FIVE GRANDCHILDREN, FOUR GRANDDAUGHTERS, AND THEY LOVE ME MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE WORLD, RIGHT? [LAUGHTER] BUT NATALIE IS OUR SON BO'S OLDEST AND SHE HAS ALL OF HE WAS MADE OF AND A LOT MORE. SHE HAS BEEN COMING OUT WHEN SHE CAN. SHE WAS ABLE TO PLAY A LITTLE HOOKY YESTERDAY TO COME OUT, AND SO SHE IS WITH US AND I WANT TO THANK HER FOR BEING HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOOK, FOLKS. YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND I WANT TO THANK BRUCE AND BETTY. I DON'T KNOW WHERE BETTY IS BUT I WANT TO THANK THEM BOTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS A LONG TIME. FOLKS, THIS IS ALL ABOUT A BASIC, BASIC POINT. MY DAD USED TO ALWAYS SAY, FOR REAL, YOU REMEMBER THE THINGS YOUR FATHER SAID OR MOTHER SAID MORE THAN ONCE. HE WOULD SAY, JOEY, EVERYBODY , NO ONE IS BETTER THAN YOU BUT EVERYONE IS YOUR EQUAL. THAT WAS A MANTRA IN MY HOUSE. NO ONE IS BETTER THAN YOU, BUT EVERYONE IS YOUR EQUAL. THAT IS HOW I WAS RAISED. I WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT THAT EVERYBODY DESERVES A SHOT. I CAME FROM TWO LITTLE TOWNS AS A KID, SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. IF YOU LISTEN TO PER ROCK , BARACK OBAMA, YOU WOULD THINK I CLIMBED OUT OF THE COAL BUCKET WITH A SHOVEL IN MY HAND, BUT MY DAD WAS A WHITE COLLAR SALESPERSON. EVERYTHING DIED ECONOMICALLY. I MOVED BACK TO CLAYMONT, DELAWARE, WHICH WAS THEN A BIG STEEL TOWN. WE HAD SEVERAL STEELWORKERS IN THAT TOWN AND I GREW UP SELF-CONSCIOUS. I CAME FROM AN IRISH CATHOLIC NEIGHBORHOOD IN SCRANTON AND I WAS SUBCONSCIOUS THAT I WASN'T POLISH OR ITALIAN BECAUSE THAT WAS EVERYBODY THAT WORKED IN CLAYMONT. EVERYBODY BELIEVED, LIKE BRUCE SAID, IF YOU WORKED HARD AND PLAYED BY THE RULES, THERE WASN'T ANYTHING YOU COULDN'T DO. YOU HAD A CHANCE TO MAKE IT. I'M THE FIRST PERSON IN MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE, AND IT WAS A BIG DEAL TO MY DAD, BUT IT WAS LIKE, THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO. HERE'S THE POINT. THE POINT OF IT IS, WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW REALLY IS , WE REALLY ARE AND THE BAD SOUL OF THE COUNTRY. WE ARE NOT HOW THIS MAN IS CONDUCTING WORLD AFFAIRS OR AFFAIRS AT HOME, PITTING PEOPLE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER BASED ON THEIR RACE, RELIGION, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE MALE OR FEMALE, AND THE THINGS HE SAYS WHEN TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IS DISGRACEFUL. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF SAYING IT. AS MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO SAY, IF YOU SPOKE LIKE THAT, WE WOULD WATCH YOUR MOUTH OUT WITH SOAP. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD EVER IMAGINE WE WOULD HEAR ANYTHING LIKE THIS. I DON'T THINK THEY THOUGHT WE WOULD HEAR ANYTHING LIKE THIS. FOLKS, THE REASON I TALK ABOUT RESTORING THE SOUL OF THE COUNTRY, WE CAN'T DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IF WE DON'T RESTORE THE BASIC SENSE OF DIGNITY AND DECENCY FOR WHICH WE TREAT ANOTHER. IT SOUNDS CORNY TO SAY IT, BUT WE WERE ORGANIZED ON A PRINCIPAL. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, BUT WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO THAT. WE'VE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THAT. THIS MAN FUNDAMENTALLY WALKED AWAY FROM IT, AND HIS WORD CANNOT BE TAKEN AT HOME AND\/OR ABROAD. HE HAS ABANDONED OUR FRIENDS, AND BRACED DICTATORS, , EMBRACED DICTATORS, BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. AS DEMOCRATS, WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE RUNNING, BUT YOU KNOW, ONE OF YOU SAID TO ME, I WANT EXPOSE YOU, BUT I MET SOME FOLKS IN THE BACK THAT SAID \" STOP TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND TALK ABOUT YOUR VISION.\" HERE'S THE DEAL. THE PRESS WANTS VERY MUCH, AND SOME OF THE OPPONENTS, WANT TO CHARACTERIZE VIEWS IN TERMS OF IF YOU'RE THINKING BIG AND IF YOU ARE CRITICIZED. IF SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE IS OUTLANDISH, YOU MUST BE REPUBLICAN, AND IN FACT YOU EITHER THINK BIG OR SMALL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE VISION I HAVE FOR THIS COUNTRY, THERE IS NOTHING SMALL ABOUT IT. IT IS LIKE GOING TO THE MOON. LOOK, WE CAN PROVIDE FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. I VISION IS NO ONE GOES TO BED LIKE MY DAD DID IN OUR THREE BEDROOM HOUSE WITH FOUR KIDS AND A GRAND POP LIVING WITH US, WORRYING ABOUT HOW HE'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF HIS FAMILY , FOLKS. IF YOU NOTICE, THEY LEFT BEFORE I COULD ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS, NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON THAT IS WHAT'S WRONG WITH OUR PARTY RIGHT NOW. THAT EVERYTHING IS TAKEN IN CONTEXT THAT ARE NOT ACCURATE , CONTEXTS THAT ARE NOT ACCURATE. HERE'S THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE, THE PLANS WE HAVE, AND YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME IMPLEMENT, ARE BOLDER THAN ANY PLANS THAT HAVE COME ALONG. EVERYTHING A PERSON IN AMERICA IS ENTITLED TO HEALTH CARE, BUT I'M ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT HEALTH CARE. I KNOW HOW TO GET IT DONE AND PASS IT, AND I KNOW HOW TO COVER IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF YOU NOTICE, SOME OF OUR OPPONENTS ARE GOOD PEOPLE AND ARE STRUGGLING TO TELL YOU HOW IN GODS NAME THEY WILL PAY FOR ANYTHING. I TELL YOU STRAIGHT UP HOW WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT AND HOW MUCH IT WILL COST AND HOW IT WILL GET DONE, AND I'VE DONE IT. THE SECOND THING GOING ON IS WE NEED TO FUNDAMENTALLY RADICALLY CHANGE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM, BUT WE CAN DO THAT. WE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT GOING OUT AND MAKING A PROMISE WE WILL COVER EVERYBODY'S DEBT NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, NO MATTER HOW IT WAS ACQUIRED, WHETHER YOU FINISHED SCHOOL OR NOT, ETC.. EVERYBODY KNOWS IF YOU START OFF IN A TITLE I SCHOOL, YOU ARE FINDING YOURSELF AT A SLIGHT DISADVANTAGE TO BEGIN WITH BECAUSE YOU COME FROM A COMMUNITY THAT HAS FEWER RESOURCES. I TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES, $15 BILLION TO 14 BULLION DOLLARS. TEACHERS GET SALARIES OF $60,000, YOU CAN BRING IN SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS, AND EVERY SINGLE STUDY IN YOUR GREAT UNIVERSITIES AND AROUND THE COUNTRY SHOW IF YOU DO THAT, IT EXPONENTIALLY INCREASES THE PROSPECT OF A CHILD GOING PAST HIGH SCHOOL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE VISION I HAVE IS THAT EVERYBODY IS QUALIFIED FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE, WHETHER YOU LOST YOUR JOB AT AGE 50 AND HAVE TO GO BACK AND FIND A NEW WAY TO MAKE A LIVING, OR WHETHER YOU ARE RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL, CAN DO IT FOR FREE BECAUSE WE CAN AFFORD IT. IT IS A $6 BILLION PROJECT. $6 BILLION, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS CUT ONE OF THE ONE TRILLION , $1,400,000,000,000 IN TAXES OUT THERE , TAX CUTS OUT THERE. IT'S A VISION. RIGHT NOW, I DID A STUDY FOR THE PRESIDENT, MY PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND ON WHAT THE JOBS IN THE FUTURE ARE. SIX IN 10 JOBS REQUIRE MORE THAN A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE TO GET THE JOB TODAY. THERE ARE RATIONAL WAYS TO DO THIS, BUT IT IS A BOLD VISION, A BOLD VISION. WE CAN ALSO HAVE PEOPLE PAY OFF THEIR STUDENT DEBT AND HAVE STUDENT DEBT FORGIVEN IF THEY DO WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE, ENGAGE IN CHARITABLE OR VOLUNTEER WORK. IF YOU ARE A TEACHER, WORKING A WOMAN'S SHELTER, YOU WORK AND YOU ARE INVOLVED IN THE PEACE CORPS OR DOMESTIC POLICY, THERE IS A LOT OF WAYS YOU CAN WRITE OFF THAT DEBT IF YOU VOLUNTEER. SO, PUBLIC SERVICE, THAT IS THE POINT. THAT'S IT. YOU KNOW. YOU DID IT AS A SENATOR. YOU MADE IT SO PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF, FIRST TIME COLLEGE GOERS COULD WORK AT THE CAPITOL HILL AND DO THE SYMPOSIUM AT THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] LOOK. THE OTHER THING IS THAT GLOBAL WARMING, LOOK, THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WE MAKE THESE ASSERTIONS THAT GET ELIMINATED IN TWO YEARS, NO ONE SAYS THAT, BUT THE FACT IS THAT WE KNOW HOW TO GET TO ZERO IN MISSIONS , EMISSIONS BY 2050, AND BY 2030, WE CAN LOCK IN SYSTEMS YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF SO WE CAN GET THERE AND GUARANTEE IT. BUT FOLKS, WE ONLY MAKE UP 15% OF THE WORLD'S PROBLEM. THE REMAINING 85% IS THE GROUP , 85% IS THE GROUP I PUT TOGETHER CALLED THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD WITH 170 THREE OTHER NATIONS THAT, IN FACT, MAKE UP 85% OF THE PROBLEM. THERE ARE TWO THINGS WE HAVE TO DO, THE FIRST THING AS PRESIDENT IS I WILL REJOIN THE THING I HELP PUT TOGETHER, NUMBER ONE. [APPLAUSE] NUMBER TWO, WITHIN THE FIRST 100 DAYS, I WILL HAVE THOSE 173 COUNTRIES AND THEIR LEADERS COME TO THE UNITED STATES FOR A CONFERENCE ON HOW WE WILL UP THE ANTE AND GET THIS DONE. I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE MY WHOLE CAREER. RINGING NATIONS TOGETHER AS WELL AS PASSING THINGS IN THE LEGISLATIVE HALL, CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE HAVE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION, AND I WILL RESIST THE 10 PATIENT TODAY TO CRITICIZE ANY OF MY OPPONENTS WHO ARE RUNNING FOR THE NOMINATION. THE WAY WE WIN IS UNIFY, COME TOGETHER AS DEMOCRATS. WE ALL HAVE THE SAME HOPES AND DREAMS. THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO WE GET THERE. IT'S NOT A LACK OF A VISION. MY VISION IS AND UNDERSTAND. WE ALL HAVE BASICALLY THE SAME HOPES AND DREAMS. THE QUESTION IS PRACTICALLY HOW DO WE GET THERE? BUT IT'S NOT A LACK OF A VISION. THE VISION IS MY PRACTICALLY HOW DO WE GET THERE? BUT IT'S NOT A LACK OF A VISION. THE VISION IS MY VISION IS MORE EXTENSIVE THAN ANYBODY'S OUT THERE. IT'S MADE TO LOOK LIKE BIDEN IS COMING OUT WITH SOME MODERN PROPOSAL. THERE'S NOTHING MODERN ABOUT MAKING SURE EVERYONE HAS HEALTHCARE AND CAN AFFORD IT. THERE'S NOTHING MODERN ABOUT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IN AMERICA SO WE CAN, IN FACT, COMPETE IN THE 21st CENTURY. I COULD GO ON AND ON. THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ALL HERE TO HELP, YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKING OUT OF THIS CAMPAIGN. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY ATTACKING ANY OTHER DEMOCRAT EVEN WHEN THEY SAY NOT SO ENLIGHTENING THINGS. OR EVEN WHEN THEY ATTACK US. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT'S NOT WHO I AM. I'VE NEVER, EVER RUN A NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN. AND I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT NOW. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO COMPETE HONESTLY, AND FAIRLY AND, FOR EXAMPLE, JUST IN THE LAST , I GOT STARTED LATE IN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE WE WEREN'T SURE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO RUN. WE WEREN'T SURE ABOUT IT BECAUSE I CAMPAIGNED LIKE THE DEVIL FOR HILLARY, DID 84 EVENTS FOR HER AROUND THE COUNTRY, SHE WOULD HAVE MADE A GREAT PRESIDENT, BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN I SAW THOSE FOLKS COMING OUT OF THE FIELDS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, I SAID I CAN'T REMAIN SILENT. JILL AND I DECIDED WE SHOULD DO IT, BUT WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE A VERY UGLY CAMPAIGN WITH THIS GUY. THERE'S NOTHING , I HAVE FOUND IT HARD TO FIND AN OUNCE OF DECENCY IN THE MAN AND SO WE KNEW THE UGLY AND KNEW IT WOULD BE HARD FOR OUR CHILDREN, BUT MY GRAND DAUGHTER AND HER FOUR OTHER SIBLINGS OR COUSINS WHO ARE ALSO OUR GRANDCHILDREN, WE HAVE A RULE IN OUR FAMILY, NOT A JOKE. ANYBODY CAN ASK FOR A FAMILY MEETING. FOR REAL. BECAUSE BACK TO MY DAD'S , AND MY FAMILY. AND SO THE KIDS CALLED AND ASKED FOR A FAMILY MEETING, AND SO I GOT A CALL FROM MY OLDEST GRANDDAUGHTER, SHE'S HUNTER'S OLDEST CHILD AND SHE'S IN HER LAST YEAR OF LAW SCHOOL IN NEW YORK. SHE SAID CAN WE HAVE A FAMILY MEETING, YOU AND NANA? COME DOWN AND TALK AND THAT WAS ON A THURSDAY, WE MET ON SUNDAY SO ONE OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN CAME DOWN FROM SCHOOL IN NEW YORK, ONE FROM SCHOOL IN PENNSYLVANIA, ONE FROM SCHOOL IN WASHINGTON AND THE BOTH CHILDREN LIVE A MILE FROM US. THEY SAID YOU'VE GOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT. AND THEY SAID WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE UGLY. WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE MEAN. HER WHOLE LIFE HER DADDY HAS BEEN AN ATTORNEY GENERAL OR DECORATED GENERAL IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY. THEY UNDERSTAND. AND MY OTHER GRANDCHILDREN WERE ALSO THERE , I'VE BEEN A VICE PRESIDENT OR A SENATOR FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIFE AND THEY'RE HARDENED, THEY'RE SOPHISTICATED AND THEY KNEW WHAT IT'S LIKE. AND IT STARTED OFF WITH HER YOUNGER BROTHER WHO'S NOW IN EIGHTH GRADE AND GNAT'S IN NINTH GRADE, SHOWING ME SOMETHING ON THE , ON A , ON THE INTERNET. I'M NOT SAYING IT WAS TRUMP, I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM AND HE SAID POP WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE MEAN. WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE UGLY. AND I'M LOOKING AT THIS KID WHO'S THEN JUST GETTING OUT OF SEVENTH GRADE, AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS? AND HE TAKES OUT HIS PHONE, AND HE SHOWS ME A PICTURE OF US WALKING OUT OF THE CHURCH, MY HAND ON AN AMERICAN FLAG DRAPED COFFIN OF OUR SON, HER DADDY AND I'M REACHING DOWN AND I HAD MY ARM AROUND HIM AND I'M HOLDING HIM UNDER THE CHIN, AND THE BOTTOM LINE WAS BIDEN, MOLESTING ANOTHER CHILD. AND SO YOU KNOW, IT'S , AND THEN EACH OF THEM CAME UP, I WON'T GO THROUGH WHAT EACH OF THEM SAID, WHAT THEY KNEW WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT THE POINT IS YOU'VE GOT TO RUN, POP. THAT'S WHEN WE DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND FINALLY, DO IT. THE POINT I'M MAKING IN ALL OF THIS IS WE DON'T WANT TO GET DOWN IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE DEALING WITH OTHER DEMOCRATS IN A WAY OTHER THAN WE WANT TO BE DEALT WITH. NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY AND DO. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO UNITE THIS PARTY. WE HAVE TO BRING IT TOGETHER. WE HAVE TO WIN. [APPLAUSE] AND THE GOOD NEWS IS NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS A WHILE, JUST THIS LAST MONTH, THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND FULL QUARTER WE'VE EVER BEEN ENGAGED IN, YOU KNOW, RAISING MONEY FOR OUR CAMPAIGN. WELL, WE RAISED OVER $5,300,000 ONLINE AT $20 OR LESS. WE'RE IN A POSITION. THINGS ARE MOVING. AND FOLKS LOOK, THE FACT IS WE'RE GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE BECAUSE OF YOU. AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT GETS DOWN TO A EXAMPLE PROPOSITION. DO WE GET PEOPLE TO SHOW UP AT A CAUCUS. IT'S MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING IT MOSTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK, YOU'RE DOING IT AT NIGHT IN A GYMNASIUM SOMEWHERE, OR A SCHOOL. IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO GET THERE, AND IT'S COLD. BUT , WE REMEMBER. BUT I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A GOOD LUCK CHARM AND IT'S BO'S BIRTHDAY ON FEBRUARY 3rd, BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. WE'RE GOING TO WORK LIKE THE DEVIL TO EARN THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE OF IOWA. AND WE NEED YOU BECAUSE IT'S JUST , THIS IS HAND TO HAND, WE'VE GOT TO GET PEOPLE TO THE CAUCUSES. AND I KNOW YOUR COMMITMENT. CONCLUDING POINT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED AND I KNOW THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID IT, BUT IT'S TRUE, THAT IN REFERENCE TO PUTIN NOT WANTING ME TO BE PRESIDENT. FACEBOOK ANNOUNCED IT, THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SO-CALLED BOTS PUT ON THE INTERNET BY THE RUSSIANS, MISREPRESENTING WHO I WAS. THEY HAD PICTURES OF PEOPLE FROM IOWA OR PENNSYLVANIA OR WHEREVER AND THERE'S A PICTURE OF AN AMERICAN AND BELOW THERE IS A TEXT SAYING BIDEN IS A NO GOOD SO AND SO. HE'S A BAD MAN IN EFFECT. AND THEY TOOK THEM ALL DOWN. NOW, WHY IS IT THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE , I'M NOT JOKING. WHY DIDN'T WANT ME TO BE THE PRESIDENT? BECAUSE I FORGOT MORE ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY THAN ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE RUNNING FOR THIS OFFICE, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND THIS GUY KNOWS ME. HE KNOWS I KNOW WHO HE IS AND HE KNOWS HE KNOWS HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO FACE SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY OF HIS MALARKEY. THE SECOND THING WE'VE LEARNED. WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT DONALD TRUMP REALLY DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE THE NOMINEE. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A TIME THAT A YEAR OUT FROM A GENERAL ELECTION, A PRESIDENT HAS HIS CRONIES OUT THERE NOT ONLY MAKING QUID PRO QUOS AND HOLDING UP AND BLACKMAILING COUNTRIES WHO IN FACT, WE'RE PREPARED TO SAY IF YOU WANT OUR MILITARY HELP TO KEEP FROM MORE RUSSIANS KILLING UKRAINIANS THAN A DOM BOSS, THEN YOU'VE GOT TO GO AND SAY YOU'VE GOT TO INVESTIGATE JOE BIDEN. NOT A SINGLE, SOLITARY SHRED OF EVIDENCE HAS COME FORWARD FROM ANY AND THE SINGLE , AND EVERY MAJOR NEWS ORGANIZATION AROUND THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS ACKNOWLEDGED IT. I DID MY JOB AS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE, AS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. THEY ARGUE ABOUT APPEARANCE AND MY SON GOT OFF THE BOARD AND MADE IT CLEAR THAT IF HE HAD KNOWN WHAT HE KNEW NOW THAT THUGS LIKE RUDY GIULIANI WHAT THEY DO, HE WOULD HAVE NEVER GONE FROM A LAW FIRM WHO WAS NEGOTIATING WITH THESE FOLKS WITH HELP FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH WHAT THEY REFERRED TO AT THE TIME AS CORPORATE MANAGEMENT. SO LOOK FOLKS, THE FACT IS THEY'VE SPENT , THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET MORE OF IT, I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE SPENDING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 10 AND $15 MILLION ATTACKING ME AND JUST FLAT LYING. MOST NETWORKS WON'T EVEN PUT THEIR ADS ON THE AIR BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE FLATOUT LIES. [APPLAUSE] BUT FOLKS, THERE'S A REASON WHY HE'S DOING IT. THERE'S A STRAIGHT-UP REASON. BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE POLL SHOWS ME BEATING HIM AS I SAID, LIKE A DRUM. IN STATES THAT WE HAVE TO WIN. PENNSYLVANIA, MINNESOTA, OHIO, NORTH CAROLINA, TEXAS, ETC. SO FOLKS, DON'T BE DISWAYED BY HIM. DON'T WAVER IT. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH THIS GUY. LIKE I SAID, CONCLUDING POINT. THE REASON I'M RUNNING IS TWOFOLD. ONE BECAUSE I REALLY DO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE SENSE TO THE WORLD WHO HAVE WE ARE. OUR REPUTATION AROUND THE WORLD HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY EVISCERATED. WE HAVE LED THE WORLD NOT JUST BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER BUT BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, THAT'S HOW WE'VE DONE IT. [APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER ALLIANCES THAT MAKE US SAFER BECAUSE WE KEEP OUR WORD THAT HE DOESN'T KEEP. THE WORLD DOESN'T TRUST HIM ANYMORE TO KEEP HIS WORD AS WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO. SO FOLKS, TWO THINGS I THINK I CAN BRING TO THIS RACE AND BRING TO THE PRESIDENCY IF IT ELECTED WITH YOUR HELP. FIRST IS I KNOW HOW TO GET THINGS DONE IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS EVER DONE A NUMBER OF MAJOR INITIATIVES. I WROTE THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. I GOT IT PASSED. I GO DOWN THE LINE, BECAUSE I DON'T DEMONIZE THE OPPOSITION. I DON'T GO AFTER MOTIVE. I GO AFTER THEIR JUDGMENT. WE ARGUE ABOUT JUDGMENT. THINK OF ALL THE THINGS , WHO GOT SENT UP TO CAPITOL HILL TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM? ME. NOW, THEY SAY THINGS HAVE CHANGED. WELL, IF THEY CHANGED, WE CAN'T TALK ACROSS THE AISLE AND GET ANYTHING DONE, WE'RE IN REAL TROUBLE, MAN. WE CAN'T , WE CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE. WE'LL SEE THE ABUSE OF POWER EXTEND. AND THE SECOND THING IS THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF ON DAY ONE, ON DAY ONE, THERE'S GOING TO BE NO CHANCE FOR ON THE JOB TRAINING. NOT A JOKE. NO TIME FOR ON THE JOB TRAINING. WHOMEVER WE NOMINATE HAS TO BE READY ON DAY 1 TO LOOK AT THE REST OF THE WORLD AND THE REST OF THE WORLD LOOK AT THAT PERSON AND SAY I KNOW HIM, I KNOW HE KNOWS WHO HE IS, I'VE MET WITH HIM, I'VE BEEN WITH HIM, I UNDERSTAND AND I UNDERSTAND WHETHER YOU ARE A FRIEND THAT HE'S GOING TO STAY WITH US OR IF YOU'RE A FOE, HE IS GOING TO RESIST US. AND FOLKS, I'VE MET EVERY MAJOR WORLD LEADER IN THE 35 YEARS, IN THE LAST 35 YEARS. THERE'S A FEW THAT ARE NEW NOW, RECENTLY ELECTED, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW THE PRESIDENT'S COUSIN AND PRIME MINISTER OF GREAT BRITAIN, JOKING, BUT FOLKS, THERE'S SO MUCH WE CAN DO. CONCLUDING POINT. WE HAVE SO MUCH, SO MUCH TO LOOK FORWARD TO, MY GOD. THE CAPACITY OF THIS COUNTRY IS LIMITLESS NOW COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. LITERALLY. WITH DONALD TRUMP OUT OF THE WAY THERE'S NOT A THING WE CAN'T DO. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IS INCREDIBLE. WE ARE THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN AMERICA THAN , ALL THE WORKERS ARE LITERALLY THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS WORKERS IN ASIA. SO WHY DO WE WALK AROUND LIKE OH, MY GOD WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE'RE IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF TRUMP. WITH TRUMP OUT OF THE WAY WE'VE NEVER BEEN IN A BETTER POSITION TO LEAD THE WORLD IN THE 21st CENTURY AND RESTORE AMERICA'S INTEGRITY AND WORD AROUND THE WORLD SO FOLKS, THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING. THAT'S WHAT I HOPE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO. WE HAVE ENORMOUS CAPACITY. THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I PROMISE YOU YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE MORE OF ME THAN YOU WANT TO SEE, BUT I PLAN ON WINNING IOWA. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) AND FOR A YEAR I ILLEGALLY BOUGHT MY MEDICINE IN CANADA AND SEVERAL TIMES, THEY WERE CONFISCATED. AND YOU AND BARACK OBAMA BECAME PRESIDENT AND SAVED MY LIFE. YOU'RE MY HERO. YOU SAVED MY LIFE. FOR 10 YEARS I HEARD REPUBLICANS SAYING REPEAL AND REPLACE, NOW I'VE GOT TO FIGHT DEMOCRATS DOING THAT SAME STUFF. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

During his remarks to supporters and volunteers, Mr. Biden touted his experience as vice president and as a senator, saying he would not need &ldquo;on-the-job training&rdquo; to serve as president.

I TRUST JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE CHARACTER OF THE WHITE HOUSE. WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE? JOE BIDEN WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD A TEAM OF OUTSTANDING POLICY ADVISERS, DOMESTIC POLICY ADVISERS, AND FOREIGN POLICY ADVISERS AND STAFF THEM WITH COMPETENT PEOPLE, SOMETHING WE DO NOT SEE WITH THIS CURRENT WHITE HOUSE. JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN A FIERCE ADVOCATE FOR CHILDREN, WOMEN, FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED DOMESTIC ABUSE, FOR VETERANS, MEN AND WOMEN IN THE MILITARY, AND IT WILL BE GREAT TO HAVE JOE BIDEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WON'T IT? IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE DR. JILL BIDEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, GOVERNOR LYNCH. THANK YOU. JOE AND I ARE SO HAPPY TO BE BACK AND NEW HAMPSHIRE AND ESPECIALLY TO SEE YOU AND SUSAN AGAIN AND NOW THAT WE HAVE JULIA, YOUR DAUGHTER, THANK YOU FOR COMING. I WAS RECENTLY AT A GREEK FESTIVAL HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND WE WENT WITH THE LYNCH'S, AND WHAT STOOD OUT TO ME WAS JUST HOW MUCH ADMIRATION AND AFFECTION THAT GRANITE STATERS HAVE FOR BOTH OF YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND YOUR SUPPORT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS DAY WITH US. FRIENDSHIP LIKE YOURS IS WITHOUT MEASURE. THE MEN AND WOMEN YOU REPRESENT ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND TO JOE. I TAUGHT A LOT OF FIREFIGHTERS OVER THE YEARS, AND THEIR COMMITMENT TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR SELFLESSNESS, THEIR DEDICATION TO PROFESSIONALISM AND ESPECIALLY THEIR COURAGE AND WHAT THEY DESERVE. THEY DESERVE OUR GRATITUDE AND OUR RESPECT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT OF MY HUSBAND'S CAREER I AM PROUD OF, FROM THE BILLS HE PASSED IN THE SENATE TO THE WORK HE DID SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA EIGHT YEARS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT SO MANY THINGS THAT MAKE ME THE PROUDEST OF HIM WERE NOT COVERED BY THE NEWS AND CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY. ONCE WHEN HE WAS ON A PHOTO LINE, HE MET A LITTLE BOY WITH A STUTTER. JOE HAD A STUTTER AS A CHILD AS WELL. JOE GAVE THE BOY'S MOM A NUMBER TO CALL SO THAT THEY COULD VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE THE NEXT TIME THAT THEY WERE IN THE D.C. A FEW MONTHS LATER, THIS LITTLE BOY AND HIS MOM DID RETURN TO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND JOE TOOK THEM ALONG TO HIS SPEECH PRESS, AND JOE SHOWED THE LITTLE BOY HOW HE WOULD MARK UP HIS SPEECH AND USE RHYTHM TO GET THROUGH IT. HE TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH FEAR HE USED IT TO HAVE HIMSELF ABOUT HIS OWN IMPEDIMENT AND HOW HE LEARNED TO OVERCOME IT, AND HE ENCOURAGES THE LITTLE BOY AND HE SAYS, YOU ARE SO MUCH SMARTER THAN I AM. IF I CAN DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT. JOE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE KIND OF PERSON WHO STOPS WHEN HE SEES SOMEONE WHO IS STRUGGLING. WHO FIGHTS FOR PEOPLE, WHO FEELS LEFT OUT. EVEN AS VICE PRESIDENT, HE WAS NEVER TOO BUSY TO CALL A FRIEND OR VISIT A HOSPITAL OF SOMEONE WHO WAS SICK. HIS KINDNESS, HIS CHARACTER, IT IS A PART OF EVERYTHING THAT HE DOES. IT IS WHY HE WORKS SO HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MIDDLE AND WORKING-CLASS FAMILIES DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SEEING THE DOCTOR OR SENDING THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE. IT IS WHY HE HAS HAD THE COURAGE TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT AGAIN AND AGAIN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SOMETIMES, IT IS THE UNREMARKABLE CHOICES WE MAKE THAT DEFINE WHO WE ARE. SOMETIMES, IT IS THE SMALL KINDNESSES THAT CAN CHANGE SOMEONE'S LIFE FOREVER. AND IN A TIME WHEN OUR NATION IS DROWNING IN CYNICISM AND CORRUPTION AND CRUELTY, WE NEED THAT KIND OF CHARACTER MORE THAN EVER. WE NEED A LEADER WITH EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM. SOMEONE WHO CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND NOT TEAR FAMILIES APART. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO WE CAN TRUST. A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US. AND THAT, NEW HAMPSHIRE, IS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MY HUSBAND, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I AM JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND, JOE. [LAUGHTER] FORMER VP BIDEN: I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. YOU HAVE BEEN STANDING OUT HERE A WHILE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT GIVES ME A CHANCE TO MEET SOME NEW PEOPLE DIRECTLY. THEY ONCE ASKED ME, WHAT WAS THE BEST THING ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? THE MAIN THING IS THE NUMBER OF FRIENDS YOU MAKE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE THAT YOU MEET. I CALLED THE FIREFIGHTERS HERE ARE LED BY YOUR STATE PRESIDENT, BUT ALSO BY THE INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENTS, MY BUDDY, AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME ACROSS THE COUNTRY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: I PROMISE I WILL NOT KEEP YOU LONG BECAUSE IT IS FREEZING OUT HERE. [LAUGHTER] FORMER VP BIDEN: I WENT TO SCHOOL IN SYRACUSE, IT IS EVEN COLDER. BUT HEARING YOUR STORIES, THE FEAR IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE AND THE DISCUSSIONS THAT TOOK PLACE AROUND KITCHEN TABLES THIS MORNING OF ORDINARY, HARD-WORKING FOLKS, THINGS THAT I THINK THE FELLOW OCCUPYING THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NO SENSE OF, NO EMPATHY FOR, AND NO KNOWLEDGE OF. I WONDER HOW WOULD PEOPLE SAT THE KITCHEN TABLE TODAY AND SAID, WHO WAS GOING TO TELL HER? WE DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO SEND HER BACK TO UNH. OR YOU GOT A RIDE ON THOSE TIRES , THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS IN MY HOME GROWING UP, WE HAVE TO RIDE THOSE TIRES ARE ANOTHER 10,000 MILES, WE CANNOT AFFORD NEW TIRES NOW. PRACTICAL THINGS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE'S EVERYDAY LIVES. IT IS ABOUT, I THINK IS ON THE BALLOT RIGHT NOW, THE CHARACTER OF OUR NATION IS ON THE BALLOT. IF TRUMP IS REELECTED, FIRST OF ALL, WE KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IS WORRIED CAN WE EVEN OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF HIM. WE CAN. WE CAN OVERCOME THESE FOUR YEARS. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. WE NEED SOMEBODY TO BE ABLE TO REUNITE THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AND THE WORLD, BUT IT IS WITHIN OUR REACH. BUT EIGHT YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY. AND THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: I HAVE LEARNED TWO THINGS. ONE IS THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE PRESIDENT. ALL OF THOSE BOTS HE PUT OUT ON THE INTERNET. BUT ALSO, THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE THE NOMINEE. I WONDER WHY HE DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE THE NOMINEE. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I TELL YOU WHAT. WHEN I ANNOUNCED I WAS RUNNING, I SAID WE WERE IN THE BATTLE OF THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. AND I MEANT IT. IT IS NOT AN ABSTRACTION BUT LIVING UP TO OUR VALUES. I TALK ABOUT THE SOUL OF THE NATION, I TALK ABOUT PEOPLE LYING AWAKE AT NIGHT, LIKE MY DAD WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED IF I GET SICK, WHAT HAPPENS I DON'T HAVE INSURANCE, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FAMILY , WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? OR SENDING OUR KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL, ACTIVE FIRE DRILLS, LIVE FIRE DRILLS IN SCHOOL, SENDING THESE KIDS OFF , HOW MANY OF YOU DID THAT THE SEPTEMBER? WHAT IS WRONG WITH US. WE DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO TAKE ON THE NRA? I HAVE TAKEN THEM ON TWICE AND BEATEN THEM TWICE, AND I WILL DO IT AGAIN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: I WILL LEAVE IN A SECOND AMENDMENT, BUT NOBODY SAYS YOU CAN HAVE A MAGAZINE WITH 100 BULLETS IN IT. WE PROTECT GEESE MORE THAN WE PROTECT, NO JOKE. YOU CAN ONLY HAVE THREE SHOTGUN SHELLS WHEN YOU GO SHOOT FOR GEESE. WE PROTECT GEESE BETTER THAN WE DO OUR KIDS. FOLKS, LOOK. THE FACT IS THAT THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT HAVING THEIR HEALTH CARE. LOOK, WE CAN BUILD ON IT, I WAS THERE AND HELPED PASS OBAMACARE. IT MADE A GIGANTIC DIFFERENCE TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA. 160 MILLION PEOPLE, AND NOW THAT HAVE INSURANCE. THE FOLKS I AM RUNNING AGAINST OR WITH ARE SAYING YOU CAN NO LONGER HAVE YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE. I THINK, LET THEM MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS. IF THEY DO NOT WANT THEIR PRIVATE INSURANCE, THEY CAN JOIN THE PUBLIC OPTION THAT I PROVIDED AN OBAMACARE AND EXPANDED. HERE IS THE POINT. THE POINT OF ALL OF THIS IS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE , DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHO DONALD TRUMP IS , THEY DO. WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE STAND FOR UNITY, NOT DIVISION. WE STAND FOR HOPE, NOT FEAR. WE STAND FOR SCIENCE, NOT FICTION. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: AND DEMOCRATS, WE STAND VERY STRAIGHTFORWARDLY FOR TRUTH, NOT LIES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: I PROMISE YOU, IF I AM YOUR NOMINEE, IT IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE TO DEFEAT THEM SOUNDLY TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE COUNTRY WILL NOT TOLERATE ANOTHER PRESIDENT LIKE THIS FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. IF YOU GIVE ME THE NOMINATION, I PROMISE YOU, I AM GOING TO BEAT HIM LIKE A DRUM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FORMER VP BIDEN: THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. I LOVE YOU. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] (music) (music) FORMER VP BIDEN: WHERE IN CALIFORNIA? FINISHING UP OUR COVERAGE OF THIS CAMPAIGN RALLY OF JOE BIDEN FROM CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE.

YOU ARE NEVER TOO YOUNG TO HAVE AN OPINION, SO LET YOUR VOICE THANK YOU, SENATOR. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU ARE VERY GRACIOUS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I TOLD THE SENATOR, I SAID, I KNOW YOU HAVE EYES IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD. MY MOTHER HAD THEM. EVERY DAMN THING I DID, SHE CAUGHT ME DOING. [LAUGHTER] WELL, IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE YOU ALL. WHAT A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL CROWD. YOU KNOW, LET ME BEGIN BY JUST SAYING, STATING THE OBVIOUS. EVERY FOUR YEARS, DEMOCRACY BEGINS IN IOWA. IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. DEMOCRACY BEGINS IN IOWA. YOU ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE THE STARTING GUN. YOU'RE THE ONES THAT DECIDE AND HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON WHO IS LIKELY TO BE THE NOMINEE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AND FOR THAT MATTER, REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHEN THERE IS NOT AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT. AND IT MATTERS A LOT, BECAUSE OF THE VALUES YOU ALL BRING TO THE PROCESS ARE REAL. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT TODAY ABOUT VALUES. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I'M RUNNING FOR , I DECIDED , JILL AND I DECIDED WE ARE GOING TO , WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS TIME FOR THREE BASIC REASONS. MOST IMPORTANT ONE WAS IS, WE HAVE TO LITERALLY, NOT FIGURATIVELY, RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. WE'RE IN TROUBLE. WE'RE IN TROUBLE. [APPLAUSE] THE WAY OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IS ACTING NOW IS NOT WHO WE ARE. IT DOESN'T REFLECT WHO AMERICA IS. THE WAY THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS OF HIS OPPONENTS, THE WAY THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS OF HIS , THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE OUR OPPONENTS, THE THUGS LIKE KIM JONG-UN AND OTHER DICTATORS AROUND THE WORLD, THE WAY HE POKES HIS FINGER IN THE EYE OF OUR ALLIES AND OUR FRIENDS FOR YEARS AND YEARS. THE WAY HE CHARACTERIZES PEOPLE WHO HAVE ANY DEFICIENCY AT ALL, ANY PHYSICAL AILMENT. THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT DISAGREE WITH HIM IS NOT HOW WE ARE RAISED. NOT HOW ANY OF YOU WERE RAISED IN THIS TOWN, IN THIS COMMUNITY, IN THIS COUNTY. NOT HOW JILL AND I WERE RAISED AT HOME. NOT A JOKE, THINK ABOUT IT. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING TO WHAT'S GOING ON. AND IT HAS AN IMPACT. WHEN PRESIDENTS SPEAK, NO MATTER WHO THE PRESIDENT IS, NO MATTER WHO IT IS, PEOPLE LISTEN. THE PRESIDENT CAN, BY HIS OR HER WORDS, RAISE OR COLLAPSE MARKETS OUT THERE. A PRESIDENT BY THEIR WORDS CAN SEND BRAVE WOMEN AND MEN TO WAR. THEY CAN BRING PEACE, BUT THEY CAN ALSO BREATHE OXYGEN TO THE HATRED THAT EXISTS IN SMALL AMOUNTS, THAT LIVES UNDER THE ROCKS OUT THERE IN AMERICA. THE HISTORY OF AMERICA HAS NOT BEEN A FAIRY TALE. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH PERIODS WHERE WE HAVE HAD FOLKS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO DEMAGOGUE AND BLAME WHATEVER THE PROBLEM THEY THINK THEY HAVE ON THE OTHER. IT'S ALWAYS THE OTHER. THE OTHER. A GUY THAT'S BECOME A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, JOHN MEECHAN, WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THE SOUL OF AMERICA. AND HE HAD A CHAPTER IN THE BOOK THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW BACK IN 1925 YOU HAD OVER 32,000, I BELIEVE THE NUMBER HE GIVES, PEOPLE, THE KU KLUX KLAN AND THEIR POINTED HATS MARCHING DOWN THE STREETS IN WASHINGTON DC. BECAUSE THEN IT WASN'T ABOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS, IT WAS ABOUT CATHOLICS AFTER WORLD WAR I WHO WERE IN FACT DECIMATED, WERE LEAVING COMING TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THE DEGRADING OF CHRISTIANITY BECAUSE OF THOSE CATHOLICS COMING FROM EASTERN EUROPE AND ITALY AND OTHER PLACES. AND HE POINTS OUT WHAT IT TOOK THEN AND EVERY OTHER TIME WE HAD TO CONFRONT THIS KIND OF , THIS KIND OF DEMAGOGUERY, IS IT TOOK EVERYBODY STANDING UP. ALL FAITHS. ALL PARTIES. ALL LEADERS. PEOPLE STANDING UP AND SAYING NOT HERE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU FOUGHT FOR. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU FOUGHT FOR AS A UNITED STATES MARINE. I AM NOT BEING MELODRAMATIC. IT IS NOT. IT IS ABOUT WE THE PEOPLE, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION. OR WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. IT SOUNDS CORNY. BUT THAT'S WHY THE PEOPLE LOOK TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. OUR WARRIORS ARE THE FINEST WARRIORS THAT HAVE EVER, EVER LIVED ON THIS EARTH, BUT THAT'S NOT WHY WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEAD THE WORLD. NECESSARY, BUT NOT SUFFICIENT. WE'VE LED THE WORLD BY THE EXAMPLE, OUR EXAMPLE, THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. THAT'S WHY THE REST OF THE WORLD LOOKS UP TO US. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UNITE, KEEP THE PEACE FOR THE LAST 70 YEARS THROUGH NATO AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE PUT TOGETHER. AND FOLKS, THE REST OF THE WORLD IS WONDERING ABOUT US. YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THAT NATIONAL POLLING DATA , THAT INTERNATIONAL POLLING DATA THAT GOES ON ABOUT , I THINK IT'S THE PEW POLL, THAT GOES OUT AND LOOKS AT WHERE WE STAND IN , WE ARE THE MOST RESPECTED NATIONS IN THE WORLD. WE ARE JUST BEHIND CHINA AND JUST AHEAD OF RUSSIA. THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND. YOU SAY, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE? WE ARE NOT RUNNING A POPULARITY CONTEST. BUT WE ARE. WE ARE. AS FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE SAID, THE ESSENTIAL NATION, WE GENUINELY ARE. WE ARE THE OUTFIT THAT HOLDS THINGS TOGETHER. AND HERE AT HOME, DID YOU EVER THINK YOU'D SEE A TIME, COMING OUT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D, I COME FROM THE STATE THAT HAS THE EIGHTH LARGEST BLACK STATE IN , POPULATION IN AMERICA. I LOVE READING THESE BIOGRAPHIES OF ME. BIDEN KNEW HE WAS GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. I WAS JUST A KID. JUST GOT ENGAGED. IT JUST GOT ME, IT MOTIVATED ME IN A WAY I NEVER THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN. BUT BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENCY THAT EXISTED. BUT, FOLKS, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE IN 2017, AS A SITTING VICE PRESIDENT, THEN OUT OF OFFICE, COMING OUT OF THE STREETS OF, IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE FIELDS CARRYING TORCHES, CONTORTED FACES. I MEAN, SCREAMING ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT THE SAME BILE THAT WAS HOLLERED AND SCREAMED AND CHANTED IN GERMANY BEFORE WORLD WAR II BEGAN ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN. WHITE SUPREMACISTS. A YOUNG WOMAN GETS KILLED. SHE WAS PROTESTING. THE PRESIDENT GETS ASKED, WHAT DO YOU THINK, MR. PRESIDENT? AND HE SAYS SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID. HE SAID, THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. FOLKS, WE GOT A LOT AT STAKE HERE, A LOT GOING ON. IN ORDER TO GET ABOUT THE BUSINESS THAT WE HAVE TO DO TO INCREASE THE QUALITY AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN THE UNITED STATES, WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. WE HAVE TO GET TO RESTORE THE , TO BEGIN TO RESTORE THE ESSENCE OF WHO AMERICA IS. THE SECOND REASON I'M RUNNING IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RESTORE, WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY HAS ALWAYS BEEN, ALWAYS BEEN HARDWORKING, WORKING CLASS AND MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE. THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. WALL STREET DIDN'T BUILD THE COUNTRY. THEY ARE NOT BAD, PER SE, BUT THEY DIDN'T BUILD AMERICA. PEOPLE THAT BUILT AMERICA ARE THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS I COME FROM AND PEOPLE HERE IN MASON CITY AND THAT'S NOT A JOKE. THINK ABOUT IT. HOW WE ARE ALL RAISED. WE ARE ALL RAISED THE SAME WAY, BASICALLY. DIFFERENT EMPHASIS, BUT IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU PLAY BY THE RULES, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR BACKGROUND IS, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR ZIP CODE WAS, NO MATTER WHERE YOU CAME FROM, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING GIVEN HALF A CHANCE. WELL, THAT'S NOT HAPPENING NOW. MIDDLE CLASS IN AMERICA IS GETTING CLOBBERED. WE'RE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE LIFETIME OF ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM. SECONDLY, YOU HAVE WELL OVER HALF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS THINKING THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING AS HIGH AS THEIRS. THERE'S NEVER BEEN SO MUCH, HOW CAN I SAY IT? NOT DEPRESSION. SO MUCH ANXIETY. SINCE PROBABLY THE GREAT DEPRESSION ABOUT THE FUTURE, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. THIS TIME BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. WE HAVE TO BUILD, WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS IN SMALL TOWNS AND RURAL AMERICA, IN THE SMALL TOWNS AND IN RURAL AMERICA. NOT JUST REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS SO THAT IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU RAISE YOUR CHILDREN AND THEY DECIDE THEY HAVE TO LEAVE TO GO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY SOMEWHERE ELSE. WE HAVE TO BUILD IT HERE. HERE. IN THE PARTS OF MY STATE, THE TOWNS OF 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 PEOPLE, IN TOWNS OF 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 PEOPLE, SO PEOPLE HAVE A REASON TO STAY, BECAUSE YOU ALL ARE, IT SOUNDS LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF HYPERBOLE. YOU ARE THE MORAL CENTER OF THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, WE ALL SAY, Y'ALL TALK ABOUT AMERICAN VALUES AND MIDWESTERN VALUES AND MIDDLE-CLASS VALUES BUT IT'S TRUE. IT'S WHO WE ARE. IT'S WHO WE ARE. AND FOLKS, THE THIRD THING WE HAVE TO DO, WE HAVE TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY. I KNOW A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE SEEKING NOMINATION DON'T THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE. THEY ARE VERY GOOD PEOPLE, BY THE WAY. ALL THE PEOPLE I'M RUNNING WITH AND WE ARE RUNNING WITH ONE ANOTHER, THEY ARE GOOD, DECENT, HONORABLE PEOPLE. BUT THE FACT IS, A LOT OF THEM THINK THERE'S NO WAY TO UNITE THE COUNTRY, NO WAY TO BRING US TOGETHER BECAUSE THINGS HAVE CHANGED. IF YOU WATCH ANY OF THOSE DEBATES WHICH ARE REALLY NOT DEBATES, THEY ARE 60-SECOND ASSERTIONS WE MAKE , [LAUGHTER] AND THAT'S NO CANDIDATE'S FAULT. IT'S JUST THE NATURE OF HAVING 10, 12, 90 PEOPLE ON A STAGE. [LAUGHTER] BUT LOOK, THE FACT IS THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, UNLESS WE PULL THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AGAIN, WE GOT A REAL PROBLEM. THE WAY OUR RULES ARE SET UP, THE WAY OUR CONSTITUTION IS SET UP, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REACH CONSENSUS. OR YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING DONE. IT JUST RESULTS IN THE ABUSE OF POWER IF YOU DON'T GET CONSENSUS. THE PRESIDENT SAYS, WELL, NO ONE'S ACTING SO I HAVE THE RIGHT TO ACT. THAT'S NOT RIGHT FOR A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN. AND FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, I THINK, ARE READY. LOOK, LOOK HOW WE'RE EVEN GETTING DIVIDED BASED ON URBAN AND RURAL NOW. WHY SHOULD SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN A SKYSCRAPER IN NEW YORK CITY OR IN LOS ANGELES HAVE ANY MORE OR LESS OF AN OPPORTUNITY, WHY DO WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THAT AND SOMEONE LIVING ON A FARM IN THIS COUNTY? BUT THAT'S HOW WE'RE KIND OF MAKING IT OUT THESE DAYS. LOOK AT THE SPLIT. YOU READ ALL THAT, THOSE OPINION PIECES IN THE PRESS. THE GREAT DIVIDE BETWEEN URBAN AMERICA AND RURAL AMERICA. THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT. THAT DIDN'T ALWAYS EXIST. ALL THESE DIFFERENCES BUT NEVER EXISTED THE WAY IT DOES NOW. AND FOLKS, WE GOT TO CHANGE IT. AND THE WAY TO START TO CHANGE IT, AND I AM GOING TO GET RIGHT TO IT AND NOT KEEP YOU LONG HERE. THE WAY TO CHANGE IT IS THAT YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR GRANDCHILDREN GROWING UP IN MASON CITY IN THIS COUNTY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE IN A POSITION THAT WHEN THEY GROW UP, THEY CAN CHOOSE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO STAY, RAISE THEIR FAMILIES RIGHT HERE IN MASON CITY AND IN THE RURAL COUNTIES AROUND SURROUNDED , SURROUNDING YOU. BUT IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO DO, ISN'T IT? I REMEMBER AS A KID, WE USED TO TAKE THE IOWA TEST. REMEMBER THE IOWA TEST? NO, I MEAN IT. YOU HAD THE BEST EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY AND YOU WERE THOUGHT TO HAVE THE BEST EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHAT'S HAPPENING? SO FOLKS, LET ME GET RIGHT TO IT. I THINK, YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS I WANT TO DO AND OTHERS WANT TO DO, IS TO HAVE A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT IN FACT PROVIDES FOR EVERYONE, EVERYONE HAVING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, EVERYBODY. WELL, I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO DO THAT. THE WAY IS TO BUILD ON OBAMACARE. THE PROUDEST, ONE OF THE PROUDEST MOMENTS I HAD AS VICE PRESIDENT IS HELPING THE PRESIDENT GET EVERY DEMOCRAT WE NEEDED, WHICH IS NOT ALL THAT EASY TO DO INITIALLY, ALL THE, COME ON UP. COME ON. HOW ARE YOU DOING? MEET MY CAMPAIGN MANAGER. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] WHAT'S YOUR NAME DECK OF , WHAT'S YOUR NAME? THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT WAS A GIGANTIC CHANGE. WE MADE SURE THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF KIDS AND PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS COULD BE COVERED, THEY GET INSURANCE, CAN AFFORD IT. 20 MILLION PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE BEFORE ARE COVERED. WE CAN GO ON, BUT THE POINT I'M MAKING IS THIS. NOW IS TIME TO BUILD ON THAT. DO WHAT BARACK AND I WANTED TO DO THE FIRST TIME OUT, ADD A PUBLIC OPTION, MEDICARE OPTION, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE PRICE OF DRUGS BY SETTING UP A BOARD THAT IN FACT SETS THE PRICE OF THOSE DRUGS LIKE THEY DO IN OTHER COUNTRIES. PUT IN A POSITION WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO INCREASE THE SUBSIDIES TO BUY INTO WHAT WILL BECOME, GOD WILLING, BIDEN-CARE, OBAMA, , BIDENCARE, OBAMACARE ASIDE. WE CAN DO IT. IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY OVER 10 YEARS BUT ALLOWS YOU TO KEEP YOUR INSURANCE IF YOU NEGOTIATED AN INSURANCE POLICY THAT YOUR EMPLOYER SET UP. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE IT UP. BUT IF YOU WANT TO, YOU CAN BUY INTO A PLAN WHERE YOU HAVE NO MORE THAN $1,000 DEDUCTIBLE. YOU CAN AFFORD IT. IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT, YOU CAN AUTOMATICALLY JOIN A MEDICARE PLAN THAT EXISTS WITHIN THIS PROBLEM. , THIS PUBLIC OPTION. BUT HERE'S THE POINT. IT DOESN'T COST $35 TRILLION. [LAUGHTER] BUT WE CAN DO IT. WE CAN DO IT. THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN RURAL AMERICA. MY STATE IS RURAL, BY THE WAY. EVERYBODY THINKS THAT DELAWARE IS A BIG URBAN STATE. THE LARGEST TOWN IS 85 THOUSAND, NEXT LARGEST TOWN IS 20000 AND EVERYTHING BELOW THAT. GUESS WHAT? IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD TEACHERS, DON'T HAVE ACCESS, AND YOU DO, DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A GOOD EDUCATION, IT'S GETTING TOUGHER. WE'RE LOSING. WE ALREADY ARE ABOUT 150,000 , THAT'S THE PRESIDENT CALLING ME. JUST PUT HIM THROUGH. [LAUGHTER] HE ALWAYS DOES THAT. HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT I WANT HIM TO DO. [APPLAUSE] DO ME A FAVOR. HE'S WITH NATO RIGHT NOW. TELL HIM DON'T KEEP SCREWING IT UP, OK. TELL HIM TO, OK. ALL RIGHT. ANYWAY. I GUESS I SHOULDN'T KID SO MUCH. ANYWAY. I'M VIOLATING MY OWN RULE. NEVER CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT WHENEVER HE'S ABROAD. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL HE GETS HOME. ANYWAY. [LAUGHTER] BUT ANYWAY, LOOK, IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT MAKING SURE TEACHERS' SALARIES ARE MORE COMPETITIVE, WE'RE GOING TO BE DOWN 500,000 TO 700,000 TEACHERS IN THE NEXT GENERATION. [APPLAUSE] THEY GET PAID A LOT LESS. THERE'S ANSWERS. THERE'S THINGS CALLED TITLE 1 SCHOOLS, SCHOOLS IN DISTRICTS THAT DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEIR BACKGROUND IS, IT'S NOT BASED ON RACE OR, IT'S BASED ON INCOME OF THE COMMUNITY. WELL, A LOT OF RURAL COMMUNITIES DON'T, THEY'RE TITLE 1 SCHOOLS. RIGHT NOW WHAT WE DO, WE SPEND A TOTAL OF $15 BILLION YEARLY FOR ALL THOSE SCHOOLS TO SUBSIDIZE THEM. IF WE TRIPLE THAT TO $45 BILLION A YEAR AND BY THE WAY, JUST ELIMINATED A COUPLE INCREDIBLY LUCRATIVE TAX CUTS THIS PRESIDENT HAS PUT FORWARD FOR THE TOP 0.1%, WE CAN PAY FOR ALL THIS. ANYWAY, THE POINT IS, IF WE DO THAT, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE CHILD NO MATTER WHAT THEIR BACKGROUND IS CAN START SCHOOL, NOT DAYCARE, SCHOOL AT AGE 3, 4, AND 5. THE STUDIES AT ONE UNIVERSITY HERE IN THIS STATE SHOW THE FOLLOWING. A CHILD WITH THAT OPPORTUNITY HAS AN EXPONENTIALLY GREATER CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL. STAYING OUT OF TROUBLE. BEING ABLE TO DO WELL. IT'S A GIGANTIC IMPACT FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY WILL CATCH UP QUICKLY. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE TEACHERS GET PAID A COMPETITIVE SALARY. THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THE MONEY FIRST BECAUSE TEACHERS, AS THEY GRADUATE FROM IOWA STATE OR UNIVERSITY OF IOWA OR ANYWHERE ELSE AROUND HERE, WHAT HAPPENS? THEY GRADUATE AND THEY MAKE 27% LESS THAN ANY OTHER GRADUATE COMING OUT OF THE SAME SCHOOL WITH A DIFFERENT DEGREE. AND IT SOUNDS CORNY. IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE I'D BE SLEEPING ALONE IF I DIDN'T SHARE THIS VIEW. [LAUGHTER] YOU THINK I'M KIDDING, DON'T YOU? NO. TEACHING IS NOT WHAT JILL DOES, IT'S WHO SHE IS. MY POINT IS THIS. WE ARE IN AN INCREDIBLE POSITION. TEACHERS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE WE HAVE. THEY ARE THE, THESE AREN'T SOMEBODY ELSE'S KIDS. THEY ARE ALL OUR KIDS. THEY'RE THE KITE STRINGS THAT LIFT OUR NATIONAL AMBITIONS TO , NATIONAL AMBITIONS ALOFT. AS JILL SAYS ALL THE TIME, ANY COUNTRY THAT OUTEDUCATES US IS GOING TO OUTCOMPETE US. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. NOT A JOKE. DOES ANYBODY THINK IT'S POSSIBLE IN 2020 OR 2030 OR 2040 TO BE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS WITH 12 YEARS OF EDUCATION ALONE? IT'S NOT, THINGS ARE CHANGING SO RAPIDLY. DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE BUT YOU MAY HAVE TO HAVE A CERTIFICATE. YOU MAY HAVE TO HAVE AN APPRENTICESHIP THAT YOU CAN MOVE THROUGH QUICKLY. YOU MAY HAVE TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WE CAN AFFORD THESE THINGS. I CAN MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY PERSON QUALIFIED FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAN GO FOR FREE, INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE OLDER, WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OF, BECAUSE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES THAT'S TAKING PLACE TO COME BACK AND BE RETRAINED AS HARD AS IT IS. WE'VE LOST OVER 200,000 SALES JOBS IN AMERICA. AVERAGE AGE OF THE PERSON LOSING A JOB, 49. AVERAGE SALARY, $50,000. WHY? NOT BAD. NOT BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS EVIL. BUT AMAZON CAME ALONG. EVERYBODY, I AM NOT GOING TO ASK YOU BUT HOW MANY BUY ONLINE FOR CHRISTMAS? AGAIN, I AM NOT SAYING IT'S BAD. GUESS WHAT'S HAPPENED? YOU GOT AN AWFUL LOT, MANY OF YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH IT LIKE MY DAD DID. ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'VE BEEN DOING WELL, YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR YOUR FAMILY, ALL OR HALF THE INCOME, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE NO JOB AND YOU'RE 50 YEARS OLD. WHAT DO YOU DO? WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY OTHER MAJOR TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IS TAKING PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA WE HAVE NOT ONLY PROVIDED FOR THE TECHNOLOGY, WE'VE PROVIDED FOR OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO GET PUT OUT OF PLACE BECAUSE OF THE TECHNOLOGY. WE'RE NOT DOING IT. THERE'S SO MANY THINGS AVAILABLE TO US. AND FOLKS, I THINK THE BEST COMMENT I EVER HEARD, THE MOST HONEST COMMENT I EVER HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP USE, REMEMBER, RIGHT AFTER HE GOT ELECTED, THE PRESS WILL RIGHTLY CORRECT ME ON THIS. I HOPE THEY'LL HELP ME ON THIS ONE TO GET IT RIGHT. I THINK IT WAS ABOUT TWO MONTHS AFTER HE WAS ELECTED HE SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS JOB IS HARDER THAN RUNNING A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE. I WAS LIKE, OK. [LAUGHTER] BUT HE SAID IT. I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS SERIOUS. IT'S HARDER THAN RUNNING A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE. WELL, I GUESS SO. I GUESS SO. BUT HERE'S THE THING. LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING IN RURAL AMERICA UNDER HIS POLICIES. FARMING. THIS TRADE WAR IS DEVASTATING. IT'S DEVASTATING NOT ONLY TO AGRICULTURE BUT MANUFACTURING. I SAW SOMEONE HAD A JOHN DEERE HAT ON. JOHN DEERE HAS A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. PEOPLE ARE GETTING LAID OFF. WHAT ABOUT THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY? I TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN BEING ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS OF PUTTING IT BACK ON ITS FEET BECAUSE I WAS THE AUTOMOBILE GUY IN THE ADMINISTRATION. IN OUR ADMINISTRATION. THE PRESIDENT DID IT. BUT I WAS THE GUY WHO WAS PUSHING IT. WELL, LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED NOW? THE TRADE WAR HE'S ENGAGED IN ARE ALL THE WRONG WARS, AND NOW I READ THIS MORNING HE'S ABOUT TO GO AFTER LATIN AMERICA NOW. SOUTH AMERICA NOW. OK. BUT ALL THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER HE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT. THE THING THAT MATTERS IS, CHINA, WE'RE STILL THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, BUT CHINA IS SO DARN BIG WE MAKE UP 25% OF THE WORLD'S ECONOMY. IF IN FACT WE JOIN WITH THE OTHER 25% OF OUR ALLIES, WE CAN MAKE CHINA PLAY BY THE RULES THEY DON'T GET TO PLAY FOR REAL, NOT A JOKE. NOT A JOKE. ONLY WAY TO GET THEIR ATTENTION, BECAUSE THEY BREAK THE RULES. NOT SO MUCH ON AGRICULTURE, BUT THEY BREAK THE RULES ON STEALING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THEY BREAK THE RULES ON CYBERSECURITY. THEY BREAK THE RULES ON DUMPING STEEL. THEY BREAK THE RULES ON A LOT OF THINGS. BUT GUESS WHAT, LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ASIA NOW? JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA AREN'T GETTING ALONG ANYMORE. WE ARE IN POSITION WHERE NORTH KOREA IS GAINING FOOTING. AUSTRALIA IS NOT SURE WHAT TO DO BECAUSE THAT GOLIATH ABOVE THEM, CHINA, IS JUST LEANING DOWN ON THEM. FOLKS, THERE'S NO WAY WITH NO POLICIES. THE REASON I'M TALKING ABOUT , I KNOW I AM THE FOREIGN POLICY GUY. BUT THAT'S NOT WHY I AM TALKING ABOUT IT. I AM TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE AS DIRECT IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC IMPACT , IT HAS DIRECT IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC IMPACT IS AT HOME. AT HOME. IMAGINE IF WE INVEST IN OUR OWN PEOPLE? BUT HERE'S THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY AND MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. TOM VILSACK, WHO IS , YOU KNOW , THE PEOPLE THAT KNOW YOU REALLY WELL, YOU CAN NEVER BE A HERO, BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE SMARTEST GUYS I'VE WORKED WITH. NOT A JOKE. HE WAS SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE. WHEN THE PRESIDENT GAVE ME AUTHORITY TO HANDLE ISSUES OVER FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC POLICY, NOT BECAUSE, LOOK. NO PRESIDENT CAN HANDLE ALL THE, EVERYTHING THAT LANDS ON HIS DESK, BY HIMSELF. IT'S GETTING TOO COMPLICATED. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A VICE PRESIDENT THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO TURN OVER A CHUNK OF THE RESPONSIBILITY AND TURN OVER PRESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY. WHEN THE PRESIDENT GAVE ME AUTHORITY, HE GAVE ME PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY. I ONLY DID ABOUT 20% OF WHAT HE DID, BUT THE THINGS HE GAVE ME, I DID. FROM THE CANCER MOON SHOT TO DEALING WITH THE RECOVERY ACT AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS. AND ALLOWED ME TO GO OUT AND PICK OUT ANYBODY I WANTED TO IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO WORK ON WHAT I WANTED THEM TO WORK ON. I HELD ALMOST AS MANY CABINET MEETINGS AS THE PRESIDENT DID. JUST BECAUSE OF THE SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES I HAD. MY GO-TO GUY THROUGH THE WHOLE THING, NOT A JOKE, WAS TOM VILSACK. HE WAS THE GO-TO GUY. SO WHEN I WANTED TO REFINE MY AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND RURAL POLICY, I SAT DOWN WITH THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE. AND HERE'S THE DEAL, AND I'LL CONCLUDE WITH THIS. THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY LIES IN LARGE PART IN RURAL AMERICA. IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. NOT ONLY ARE YOU IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE FOOD AND FIBER FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT MORE THAN THAT NOW. WHEN GLOBAL WARMING, YOU ARE GOING TO BECOME THE GO-TO SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY. WE SHOULD BE PAYING RURAL AMERICA AND FARMERS TO GROW CROPS WITH DEEPER ROOTS. WHY? ABSORB CARBON FROM THE AIR. WE SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE TOM HARKIN'S CONSERVATION PROGRAM, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ACRES PUT ASIDE AND PAY FARMERS TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT BECOMES A CARBON SINK LIKE AMAZON, TAKES THE CARBON OUT OF THE AIR. IT MOVES US TOWARD NET ZERO EMISSIONS. WE SHOULD BE TAKING, LIKE WE DO IN MY STATE OF DELAWARE, BECAUSE WE, WE HAVE A LARGE AGRICULTURE ECONOMY IN THE DELMARVA PENINSULA, IT'S BETWEEN A $4 BILLION AND $5 BILLION A YEAR INDUSTRY. IT'S CHICKENS. BROILER CHICKENS. TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AND HERE'S THE DEAL. IT HAS SOME SIDE EFFECTS. THEY ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY DANGEROUS. LIKE YOU HAVE OUT HERE WITH CATTLE. IT'S CALLED , AND PIGS. IT'S CALLED MANURE. WELL, GUESS WHAT, WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY NOW TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND PELLETIZE THIS. TAKE THE METHANE OUT OF IT. USE IT FOR ENERGY AND SELL THE PELLETS, BUT WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO, YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO, IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE EVERY 20, 30 MILES NEW HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIES THAT ARE THERE TO DO THIS. CLEANLY AND EFFICIENTLY. ETHANOL. LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE TO ETHANOL. HE'S CHOSEN THE OIL COMPANIES OVER THE FARMERS. WE SET THIS PROCESS GOING. YOU ALL ENDED UP IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE YOU GO, AND THOSE ETHANOL PLANTS, YOU END UP, THEY ARE NOT MAKING $10 AN HOUR, THEY ARE MAKING $45 AN HOUR. THEY'RE GROWING AN ECONOMY. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW? BUT ALL THE FUTURE, SO THEY LOST SO MANY THINGS. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE, I PROMISE YOU, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE, ESPECIALLY IF I GET ELECTED, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVESTED IN RURAL AMERICA FOR THE SAKE OF URBAN AMERICA. THIS IS A PLACE WHERE YOU BECOME, AGAIN, THE ANSWER FOR PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND I REALLY MEAN IT. THE FUTURE IS INCREDIBLY BRIGHT. BUT WE GOT TO INVEST. WE GOT TO INVEST. I LOOK OVER AT MY WIFE AND SHE IS GIVING ME THIS, MEANING, CUT, YOU ARE GOING ON TOO LONG AND SHE'S RIGHT, DEAD RIGHT. SHE'S WRITTEN , SHE'S ALWAYS RIGHT. I AM JILL'S HUSBAND. BUT, LOOK, THE POINT IS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THIS, I'VE LAID OUT IN DETAIL MY RURAL AMERICA POLICY. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, I'M COMMITTED TO RESTORING THE PROMISE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN RURAL AMERICA TO STAY IN RURAL AMERICA. BECAUSE, AGAIN, IF WE LOSE THE ESSENCE AND THE ETHIC OF RURAL AMERICA, WE LOSE PART OF AMERICA'S SOUL. WE REALLY DO. IT'S ABOUT WHO WE ARE, HOW WE'RE RAISED. AND FOLKS, IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND JUST LOOK DOWN THE ROAD HERE A LITTLE BIT, I KNOW THAT WHEN I GOT ELECTED AS A 29-YEAR-OLD KID TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, I'M THE FIRST SENATOR I EVER REALLY KNEW. [LAUGHTER] YOU ALL THINK I'M KIDDING. I'M NOT. [LAUGHTER] I SWEAR TO GOD. I DIDN'T REALIZE I KEPT GOING OVER TO GET AN ASSIGNMENT FROM THE MAJORITY LEADER, NOBODY GETS AN ASSIGNMENT. NO SENATOR IS EVER ASSIGNED ANYTHING BY ANYBODY. BUT I SHOWED UP EVERY TUESDAY AT 2:00 TO MY ASSIGNMENT FROM SENATOR MANSFIELD. FOLKS, I AM OPTIMISTIC. I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN I'VE EVER BEEN IN MY ENTIRE CAREER BECAUSE, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE. QUITE FRANKLY, IT'S THE REASON I'M RUNNING, BECAUSE I THINK MY EXPERIENCE CAN HELP US GET TO THE PLACE WE HAVE TO GO. WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE ELECTED PRESIDENT THAT KNOWS HOW TO GET THINGS DONE, HAS DONE BIG THINGS, PASSED BIG PIECES OF LEGISLATION, BEEN ABLE TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE AND PRODUCE OUTCOMES LIKE I WAS ABLE TO DO ON CANCER AND ABLE TO DO ON RESEARCH AND A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. BECAUSE THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THE SECOND REASON I'M RUNNING IS THE NEXT PRESIDENT, IN ADDITION, THEY ARE GOING TO FIND A DIVIDED NATION AND GOING TO FIND A WORLD IN DISARRAY. AND THAT PRESIDENT, ON THE DAY THEY'RE ELECTED AND SWORN IN ON JANUARY 20 HAS TO ASSUME THE WORLD STAGE. WITHOUT ANY, AND NO TIME FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. NOT A JOKE. IT'S NOT EVERY YEAR, NOT EVERY PRESIDENTIAL RACE REQUIRES THAT. BUT TODAY IT DOES. TODAY IT DOES. AND I HAVE VIRTUALLY MET EVERY SINGLE MAJOR WORLD LEADER AND I KNOW MOST OF THEM BY THEIR FIRST NAMES AND EVEN THE BAD GUYS I KNOW AND THEY KNOW I KNOW THEM AND THEY KNOW ME. IT'S NOT CONFRONTATION. IT'S REAL SIMPLE. PRESIDENT OBAMA USED TO ALWAYS KID ME. I'D SAY TO HIM ALL THE TIME, REMEMBER, MR. PRESIDENT, ALL POLITICS IS PERSONAL. BY THAT I MEAN, IF I WANT TO GET SOMETHING WITH YOU, WHETHER YOU , GET SOMETHING DONE WITH YOU, WHETHER YOU ARE A GOOD GUY, BAD GUY, I HAVE TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE, WHAT THE CORE OF YOU IS, AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. PUTIN KNOWS I KNOW WHO HE IS. NOT A JOKE. THE GOOD GUYS. BECAUSE AMERICA'S WORD MATTERS. WHEN A PRESIDENT STANDS BEFORE THE WORLD AND SAYS SOMETHING, OUR FRIENDS HAVE TO KNOW AND OUR FOES HAVE TO KNOW THAT THAT'S THE COMMITMENT AMERICA'S MADE. AND SO, FOLKS, THE REASON I'M OPTIMISTIC IS TAKE A LOOK AT WHO WE ARE. WE'RE ALL WALKING AROUND WITH OUR HEADS DOWN LIKE, WHOA, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? GOD, THINGS ARE SO TERRIBLE. WE HAVE THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO BE THAT IF IN FACT WE INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE. I'VE NOT MET ONE WORLD LEADER , INCLUDING XI JINPING, BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT WANTED ME TO GET TO KNOW HIM KNOWING HE WOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF CHINA, TRAVELED 17,000 MILES WITH HIM. HAD DINNER WITH HIM. THEY TELL ME 24, 25 HOURS OF PRIVATE DINNERS. I WOULD HAVE AN INTERPRETER WHISPER IN MY EAR. HE HAD ONE WHISPER IN HIS EAR. BY THE WAY, MY INTERPRETER TURNED IN THEIR NOTES. [APPLAUSE] BUT FOLKS, HE CHANGED PLACES WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN A HEARTBEAT. CHINA HAS GREAT POTENTIAL. MY GOD, THE PROBLEMS THEY HAVE THERE ARE OVERWHELMING. THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WATER. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A TRILLION-DOLLAR PROJECT TO TURN RIVERS AROUND TO MAKE THEM FLOW NORTH SO PEOPLE CAN HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO DRINK. IT'S NOT A GOOD THING. IT'S NOT GOOD. I AM NOT HAPPY THEY'RE HAVING THAT PROBLEM. THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF LAND, SOMEWHERE ESTIMATES BETWEEN 30% AND 45% OF THEIR LANDED IS , THEIR LAND IS PRETTY , POLLUTED AND CAN'T PRODUCE CROPS. THEY HAVE A MILLION MUSLIM, UIGHURS IN THE WEST IN RE-EDUCATION CAMPS, BETTER KNOWN AS CONCENTRATION CAMPS. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN HONG KONG TODAY. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE REGION. THEY HAVE PROBLEMS THAT MAKES OURS PALE IN COMPARISON. WE HAVE TO INVEST IN OUR OWN PEOPLE, THOUGH. SECONDLY, WE HAVE THE GREATEST RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN ALL THE WORLD. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN STATE IN THIS NATION THAN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. EVERY MAJOR NEW LIFE CHANGING, ALTERING THING THAT COMES OUT OF THOSE RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES, MONETIZED, MONETIZED BY BUSINESS, BUT YOU OWN THEM. YOU OWN THEM. OUR PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE BEST EDUCATED SCIENTISTS IN THE WORLD. WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF BEING ABLE TO CHANGE CANCER AS WE KNOW IT. DEAL WITH ALZHEIMER'S IF WE INVEST IN IT. MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. SO IT'S TIME TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SO IT'S TIME TO GET UP. LIFT OUR HEADS UP, AND LET'S TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY AND DO WHAT JOHN MCCAIN WANTED US TO DO. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU THE BETTER HALF OF MY FAMILY, DR. JILL BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] SO IN 62 DAYS, IOWA HAS A CHOICE TO MAKE. BUT JUST FOR A MOMENT I WANT TO TAKE YOU INTO THE FUTURE. I WANT TO TAKE YOU PAST THE CAUCUS, PAST THE ELECTION AND INTO THE NEXT YEAR, THE NEXT NOVEMBER. IT'S 2021. SO IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MORNING LIKE THIS MORNING IN IOWA AND YOU WAKE UP AND LIKE JOE AND I DID THIS MORNING, WE HAD OUR MORNING COFFEE. AND THEN YOU PICK UP YOUR MORNING PAPER AND THE HEADLINE ISN'T ABOUT SOME LATE NIGHT TWEET STORM. [APPLAUSE] INSTEAD, IT'S ABOUT OUR CHILDREN, AMERICA'S CHILDREN WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM UNIVERSAL PRE-K. IT'S ABOUT HOW THE TEACHERS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE FINALLY GOING TO GET A RAISE. YOU READ ABOUT INVESTING IN WIND TECHNOLOGY AND GREEN TECHNOLOGY THAT IS GOING TO CREATE JOBS RIGHT HERE IN IOWA. AND THEN, LIKE WE DID THIS MORNING, YOU TURN ON THE TELEVISION AND THE ANCHORS AREN'T TALKING ABOUT HOW WE ARE ON THE BRINK OF SOME ILL-ADVISED WAR. INSTEAD, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WITH A PUBLIC OPTION AND BRING DOWN PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. AND - [APPLAUSE] AND THEY'RE REPORTING THAT FINALLY, FINALLY SOMEONE IS STANDING UP TO THE N.R.A. AND KEEPING OUR KIDS AND OUR SCHOOLS SAFE! [APPLAUSE] AND WHEN THEY TURN TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU DON'T TURN THE CHANNEL. [APPLAUSE] YOU CALL IN YOUR KIDS FROM THE OTHER ROOM BECAUSE YOU WANT THEM TO HEAR WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS TO SAY. A COMMANDER IN CHIEF YOU CAN TRUST. A LEADER WHO BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER INSTEAD OF TEARING FAMILIES APART LIKE WE'VE SEEN AT THE BORDER OF THIS COUNTRY. A PRESIDENT YOU CAN FEEL PROUD OF, WHO BELIEVES THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO CAN GET US TO THE FUTURE. THERE'S ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN THIS DIVIDED TIME, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO CAN TAKE ON TRUMP IN STATES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA AND OHIO AND WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN AND THAT PERSON IS MY HUSBAND, JOE BIDEN! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT IOWA, HE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU. 62 DAYS. 62 DAYS, NOT THAT I'M COUNTING - [LAUGHTER] SO I'VE BEEN TRAVELING AROUND THIS STATE AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU A TRUE STORY. SO THEY HAVE ME MAKING PHONE CALLS TO PEOPLE AS I TRAVEL, AND THEY SAY, I'LL CALL SOMEBODY AND SAY, WELL, SUSAN, YOU KNOW, WHO ARE YOU SUPPORTING? DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SUPPORT MY HUSBAND BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HE BELIEVES IN AND I EXPLAIN IT AND THEY SAY, WELL, JILL, I DON'T KNOW. BECAUSE I HAVE ONLY MET YOUR HUSBAND THREE TIMES. [LAUGHTER] AND I'VE MET SENATOR X SEVEN TIMES. DO YOU THINK JOE COULD COME TO OUR HOUSE FOR DINNER? AND IT'S THE SPOUSE OF A CANDIDATE. IT HURTS MY FEELINGS LIKE, WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING? YOU HAVEN'T MADE UP YOUR MIND YET? SO NOW IS THE TIME. IT'S TODAY. TODAY. YOU MUST COMMIT BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY. I KNOW YOU HAVE LOTS TO DO. IT'S THE HOLIDAY SEASON. YOU'RE MAKING YOUR LIST. SO ON YOUR LIST, WHERE YOU HAVE WRITTEN, DECIDE WHO I'M GOING TO COMMIT FOR, CROSS IT OFF BECAUSE TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO COMMIT TO JOE BIDEN!

He criticized President Trump in his remarks, which focused largely on creating secure educational and health care opportunities for middle class families.

I think what I've b een through is. Give m e a t least some insigh t in to what ot her people both and folk s I know one of the reasons why I'm ta king this bus tou r 660 miles thr ough rural I owa is because you ar e the heart and soul this country I 'm not joking about but he mi ght m y state is on e of the most rura l states in America. Every body thinks Del aware is a big northeastern sta te with m ajor corporat ions i t is. Bu t the fact is of la rgest town of my state is 89 000 people next largest 2 0 and after tha t everythi ng ranges from 1500 to about 7000 people an d what I find that's where the heart and so ul relations when al l of you. I'm not be solic itous when all of you you ge t to reach out to neighbo rs you may not ev en particularly l ike when you're in trouble you in fact are there when people have a probl em treat each other with respec t you th ink honesty matters y ou think dignity is important word you think that we i n fact as Americans have an obligatio n to kind of l ive the American creed we don't always do it don't always do it we don't al ways live up to that's who we a re. That's why I believe that is so important that r ural Am eri ca and sma ll town America have an opport unity to ec onomically flourish bu t it's g oing to be very b rief and make 3 basi c s tatements to you and then open to question s if that 's alrigh t with for one no.

And but all kidding asi de folks you know you are have a you have a sen se and you've taken se riously a bend I start a campaign an d in Iowa for y our candidates all th e way b ack in 74 if wit h a for John Culver and camp aign fo r many Kennedy says and you take it seriously yo u take yo ur respons ibility seriously termin ated who should read. Present Democrat or Repu blican Party when t here's not an incumbent president but I don't think there' s any time you've had a more serious resp onsibility in t his. Because I'm runn ing not because any one of us were ru nning for the nomination because the man who occupi es the White Hous e. We ar e in a situ ation where we have find that does no t share a lot of the v ote whether you're a De mocrat Republic an inde pendent d oes not share a l ot of the ba sic val ues that we we in fact is America ns think we're about. Godless of his po licies is just basic v alu e the l ac k of bei ng able to emp athize with people is in a stunning and i t makes it fun when whe n I announce m y candidacy I sa id the reason I was running was to try to rest ore the soul of Amer ica this election is a ll about that about reass erting America's pla ce in the world we u sed to lead by the e xample not just of our power we're mos t powerf ul nation in his tory the world that's no t hyperbole really lite rally are physical ly the most powerfu l both this n ation we've led by the power o f our example example Brest the world repaired us paired us because. Of our values. But they're very much in jeopardy I'm not going to it now but mocking and making fun of a sittin g president I'm still so Ameri can th at's not who w e are that's not who we ha ve to be and so folks let me just so yo u know how. He. And t he next president wh oev er he o r sh e is God willi ng he's going to hurt a nation that's divided. And d eliberately divided by t his man s etting race r eligion and cream color against on e another from the very beginn ing as well as going to head a world in disarray when Burl eson thugs an d the tyrants around th e world were poking a fin ger in the eye while a llies and our friends w ho were going to need for our collective security o therwise we'll have to be the world's police man and we're not going to do that we have to be able t o be in a positi on to be able to put t ogether coalitions to ta ke out ISIS For exam ple I was part of what putting to gether a 16 nation coalition to do tha t we're not allowed t o stand enormous around the wor ld but we need to we need to leave man y people to loo k at us and say yes the United State s roots and we're prepare d to follow we're prepared t o work with them and so folks let me conclud e I want to say I want to go to questions i s t hat you know I think i t really is i mportant wh en you're stor ing the soul of this c ountry and I really mean it that 's not hype rbole I g enerally men who only rar think of wha t we always been made fun o f internationally an d that is that thos e tha t those quoting American values ho ne sty truth decency We ll guess what the world knows that to be t rue about us that's why they've b een w illing to follow us but it's very much in jeo p ardy righ t and folks i n addition to that you look out an d what are we doing we' r e tha t's the preside n t he does this a ll the time. So froz en Trump I'm busy O k reminder in the. Calls every time I 'm going to. But Rossley. Th e 7 nation reflects. Because a lot to do with whethe r or not the American people are going to be able to be unified again we have to unify this c ou ntry. I know some of my colleagues think that's not possible wit h the curr ent notify the c ountry we're in deep trouble when don't trouble but I bel ieve we can so much prose it 's going to have to be able t o stand on a world stage on day one and d ouble story here she can put the nati on b ack together a gain by bringing the public is no inde pende nce to common ground on many things as we ll as learned the world whe n I as sumed the stora ge the world stage Ja nuary 20th 20 21 well knows how t o know who th ere are w ho that person is and I got to know that pe rson not ion of they ar e friend and foe and so folks. That's why I'm running th at's why I'm running for president of States of America to the broader now sense restore the sort of this country and so folks let me I am of that and take any questions you all have I should cherish on your mind thank you. Yeah. Really . But the important p oint was hosp itals no t only the state but all across Ameri ca I was ra tional and I will hold it why many places where you know 60 percent of t he trauma deaths occ ur in th e America you know abo ut 20 per cent of th e populatio n 60 perce nt acut e occur in Ame rica where I lac k of access to mental acces s to hospital s or the services and sort of a lonely so it's happening everywh ere in America an d I suspect he re as well right he re is that the Rambus Mr su pposed to come are not comin g quickly enough and they're not enough th at's right in the Biden Af fordable Car e Act which I'm talkin g about is taki ng Obamacare and both n eed on Obam acare not dismantl ing it because and I p rovide for funding addi tional fu nding for hospitals not even if they don't have beds availa ble to provide for e mergency service s and to be ru de and boorish to. Post on the Medi caid Medicare because th ey can't get under t he reimburs ement for Medicare and t hey can't be timely it' s not timely enough and so when I want to do with anybody who wa nts to know give me a copy of the detail of the playing rather than the one I would not but but. Make sure we find That in this to w n. But. Th at's a plus. Because in fact qu ickly. This is in thi s book right now right is m ore likely some of the soon er you determine what it is and where it i s and how you have to d o that and the nurse I can tell God love it. I f there is only one was on the other woman. I know They came decorated hero i n the war a nd women up w ith. Knowing that they onl y had months t o live inc red ibl e man and joking Russians a re absolut ely incredib le doctors much un les s. You want it and I was in i.c.u. they come a nd look at th at you 're not goi ng to. Monit or is up t here you go sla ck you're not but afte r all I don't care if you're not i n pain a nd my nurses no w from a com e in my ear they talk to me and change my pill or read you the sense of not only about me fr om for exam ple but now. I have. That you can carr y around from t own to the to wns I found the most on m y proposal so people do n't have to wait wait in the comma nd of the services that's the biggest. Everything To try to figure out there's so mu ch me can do and I pr omise yo u that is one of my classes wh en I get in to office and I'm going t o continue the moo n shot in a way that's going to make funda ment al change but. Ask me that qu estion but I fe el. Th ere. Are also a copy of my health care plan . I ha ve a question concern i ng. The fu nd ing of the heal th c are when I lived in Washin g ton State I bought it in th e m ar ketpla ce and it became more a nd more difficult we had fewe r and fewer providers of insura nce and what they ended up doing was wh ere they would provide i n some areas of Wa shington they refused in. Our count y because they said t hey had too many elderly and sick peo ple wh ich is w hy you want insurance anyway but what they started doing is saying no you they cost us too muc h money and so this wa s on the mar ketplace so how is this goi ng to be funded if b asically the people who buy in the m arketplace or can't afford to buy elsewhe re or don't h ave it or a re the sickest a nd the elderly becau se t hat's th e problem that I saw thos e were all communit ies that you know they didn't have a lot of jo bs so the youn ger peop le would move out of them and what you would have left were a lot of people who wer e older and ha d no incomes and so t hen the y said we're not go ing to provide their interest you know the insurance because it costs us too much so. drug prices are going to come down becaus e we're going to change the w a y. We're go ing to. Over the side o f the public of all this now a s if taken away. In a prison. D rug. With the drug comp anies o n the prices of what they're goin g to charge for other drugs we're going to . Have a significa nt ret urn on your invest m ent. 1 21520 p ercent on your inv estment but you can. Run and some of t he boa rd at a church that in fact are made up of experts from around the co untry many seri ous drugs. The pri ce t hat you can charge for. D rugs come up with has been approved b y the f.d.a. have that patent that inflows should . Have don e something considerab ly different with the d rug bef ore. Y ou so I would st op and nothing but the expo n enti ally. Fact cost peo ple a lot o f this co sts. $ 20000.00 a year for g odsake and through the insura n ce company. Crossed. Not a sin gle thing ha s chan g ed. For the drug excep t. That ha s no other option but to try to purchas e the drug f rom there for mo st happy people are up to. Treat it and people are d ying becau se of it s o. That we can afford t o make it if in fact the dr ug companies sold are not going to participate in we're going to we're going to put from abroa d anything it's in fact f act because drug prices are can cert ainly cheape r with the sa me drugs in other countries in ot her places so we've got t o make it clea r we got to play fair into the system and insurance companie s they're going to be held accountable to no other ways but I have I'm happy to send you some of thi s stuff but I know I can tell by th e looks on some of the kids' faces it's kin d of glazing over right now. The boat gu y Th ank you Mr Vice Presi dent my name is Ethan Rezai I'm a high school senior her e at New Hamp ton and I just turned 1 8 yesterd ay. To plac e my question is strictly rush recession s have occurred ar ound eve ry 10 to 15 years and if you were elected in 2020 and this trend continues and using your experiences from previous administrati on that has gone through a recession w hat would you do t o lessen the impa ct of s.s. and wou ld have on people my age tha t are in college and p repa ring to enter the wor kforce from some que stions and tell you what you're going to school next year. You. Know. it was a different kind of recession it was a funny recessi o n. Has been cyclical w hat kind of talk about what you're talking a bout. H appened there's been cyclical recessions b ased upon ex penditures a whole range of o ther things but they've not been financial in the s ense that they wer e brought on by the b anks and brought on by the fin anci al industries this is a different a diffe rent kind of rec ession but there's sti ll a lot of now. In f act t hat. Are going to stimulate well. Maybe Re member it's ridiculous for the Senate a year. Ago. To change so it can pas s . The psychiat r ist. Which is a very conservative ec onom ic base pointed o ut that. D e pre ssion. And the God of every s i ngle sol itary. I spoke. To over 150 I spoke. are a rational choice to sa y a domest ic policy that can s top Ko nami growth of t hings that we h ave to do. And turn op portunity to grow t he economy because room and somethin g. T hat is the 1st off it's g oing to do is goi ng to mark my words about American Idol cultu re those are going to do it and the y're going to make money as th ey do we still gro wth so that when. What happens is I forget which one of you said something what ha ppened. Up in the decider got a roof changed the law saying that if you ar e brutal ly beaten and beat up by your sp ouse and your comm unity yo u know that doesn't qualify you fo r asylum i n America this is a ro om the y soon ripped children from th e arms of their mot hers and f athers and broken up familie s which i s not what we've done is not what we've done in the past as a na tion and so the 1s t thing I'm g oing to do is make sur e that a ll of those so-called dreame rs and thos e killed soon in fact came across the border or flown on a visa with their parents and in fact oversold the visa to push now tha t there is a dreamer's pro gram but there's also a pr oblem and so we' re not going to separate f am ilies or our families to s tart other robber That's from the stuff that's comi ng through is coming thr ough legal por ts of en try the b ad stuff and those who ar e alleged terrorists a nd the like that's coming through the physical ports of entry so it made sense to put up a wel l just because it made it 1st triple to come thr ough a legit imate port of entry but so m ethi ng. That happene d to so me kid legalization for the 11000000 undocumente d he r e. Or the over genera tion of immig rants has had t o do it. You know learn the citizenship as you go throu gh the process and you earn a p assage to the store a nd if you're turning out a felony or committing a felon y to cr imes while you're her e in fact you don't get to stay here but out of the one Jo e I am al o ne. I will r e tire. And I' m kind of unique because I'm not a R e pub lic an. I'm Ok. I've g ot 2 pro ble ms with you one is your game ther e's a reason I am her e to work for th e job I need th rough me and I kn ow damn well I don't have the mental faculties I did when I was 30 years ago all right the oth er Forget that stuff that's all. The woman I got I go t a quest ion I'm not sure answer w rong or Trump. Has been messing aro und in your cre w and over t here holdi ng her for a route for them to come out saying th ey're going to inve stig ate you we know all about t hat Graham and he's he's no back bone we know that for t hat but you were on the other hand se nt y our son river there to get a job and w or k for a gas compan y that he had no experience with gas o r nothing in order to get access to the tr uth for the president so you're you're selling access to the president just like he was. So you. to go other places and so they're stil l going to do we hav e t o not only back to reest ablish standards we had to be gin with when we le ft office and sig nificantly add to them an d that i s for example.

A SNOWY MORNING. SOME HOLIDAY CHEER GOING ON. THANK YOU FOR TAKING A BREAK FESTIVITIES TO BE HERE TO PICK THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THESE FOLKS ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU VET CANDIDATES, TALK TO CANDIDATES, HAVE THEY SHOVELED YOUR LAWN LATELY. SO I'M SUPER EXCITED AND HONORED TO INTRODUCE TWO OF MY FAVORITE CANDIDATES OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE SECRETARY JOHN KERRY IS WITH US, FOR THOSE OF YOU ON THE 2008 CAMPAIGN. [APPLAUSE] SECRETARY KERRY IS A FRIEND TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, VETERANS, WOMEN, ENVIRONMENTALISTS. WE WERE PROUD TO SEND HIM ON HIS WAY TO THE NOMINATION. AND JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] LIKE MANY OF YOU I HAVEN'T MADE MY FINAL DECISION BUT I'M EXCITED TO HAVE HIM IN THE HOUSE AND ROOM TODAY, GIVE HIM A BIG APPLAUSE, WELCOME HIM, HE WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, HE HAS BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND SAVING OUR PLANET AND SECURITY, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, IN THIS TIME THAT WE ARE ALL FACING RIGHT NOW, HE WILL BRING DIGNITY, HE WILL BRING HONOR, HE WILL BRING COURAGE AND HE WILL BRING RESPECT BACK TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WELCOME JOHN KERRY AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] IT'S SUNDAY MORNING, YOU SLEPT YESTERDAY. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE GRANITE STATE, A SECOND HOME FOR ME. I HAVE TWO SECOND HOMES, IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. [LAUGHTER] I LOVE THIS STATE. GROWING UP, I HAVE GREAT MEMORIES OF VISITING HERE CLIMBING RATTLESNAKE, GETTING UP THE HIGHWAY THERE TOWARDS SOME OF YOUR BLUE ICE YOU GET TO SKI ON SOMETIMES. AND HIGH SCHOOL IN CONCORD WHERE I WOULD RARELY LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING OF THE HOCKEY SEASON ON THE BLACK ICE AND HOW THE ICE DOESN'T EVEN FREEZE. SO IT'S HARD TO DO TODAY, BUT I LOVE THE PRIMARY TRADITION OF THIS STATE. NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU VOTED FOR ME. IT GOES FARTHER BACK THAN THAT. WHEN I WAS 24 YEARS OLD, STATIONED ON THE OTHER OF THE EARTH, WHEN RADIO BROADCASTS AND WEEKS OLD NEWSPAPERS IN A MAIL POUCH THAT FINALLY GOT TO US, SHARED WITH ME MY IDEALIZED INTRODUCTION TO THE PHENOMENON OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. JUST 40 DAYS AFTER ONE OF MY VERY CLOSEST FRIENDS IN COLLEGE WAS KILLED IN COMBAT, NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS NO LONGER JUST A PLACE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL. IN THE WINTER OF 1968, NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY. SOME OF YOU MAY OR MEMBER THAT CLOSELY. LEGIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE MY AGE, AN ARMY OF KIDS FOR PEACE, CARRYING PAMPHLETS WHILE I WAS CARRYING A GUN 1000 MILES AWAY, JUST KIDS KNOCKING ON DOORS, THE PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY BRIGADE WE CALLED THEM. THEY PROVE THEMSELVES POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SEND A MESSAGE ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT LYNDON JOHNSON COULDN'T BE PRESIDENT ANYMORE BECAUSE OF VIETNAM. IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE, IT WAS PALPABLE. AND YES IT DESERVES TO BE APPLAUDED BECAUSE YOU DID IT. [APPLAUSE] IT WAS A GRASSROOTS PRAIRIE FIRE AND THANK , AND A GREAT LESSON FOR ME AND THE POWER PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED , WE NEED NOW. 36 YEARS LATER IN MY OWN , AND MY OWN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, NEW HAMPSHIRE TOPPING OF THE LESSON OR TWO. SOMETIMES THE BEST LESSONS FRANKLY WITH THOSE LEARNED THE HARD WAY. TOWN HALL MEETINGS WHERE THE AIR CRACKLES WITH SKEPTICISM. IN 2003 IT'S NO SECRET AS WE CAME INTO DECEMBER, MY CAMPAIGN WAS STRUGGLING A BIT AND I REMEMBER YOU ALL REMEMBER UP THE HIGHWAY TOWARDS FRANCONIA, THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN. WELL A REPORTER WROTE I LOOK LIKE THE OLD MAN IN THE MOUNTAIN. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S THE HALF OF IT FOLKS BECAUSE NO SOONER DID HE WRITE THAT I LOOKED LIKE THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT THE OLD MAN IN THE MOUNTAIN CRUMBLED AND FELL SO I DID NOT THINK THAT WAS A PARTICULARLY GOOD METAPHOR. BUT GUESS WHAT, YOU ALL SAW THROUGH THAT, WE SAW THROUGH THAT. WE FOUGHT ROOM FOR ROOM, JIM FOR GYMNASIUM, FIRE HALL FOR FIRE HALL AND YOU LISTENED. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY. I DIDN'T , YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP ON ME AND YOU REALLY LISTEN TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. THIS STATE GIVES PEOPLE A LOT OF CHANCE TO PROVE THEMSELVES. YOU ARE ALSO CHUFFED , TOUGH JUDGES. YOU OUGHT TO BE, YOU BRING THOSE NOTEBOOKS MEET PEOPLE A BUNCH OF TIMES, YOU WRITE DOWN THE COMPARISON, YOU CARE, YOU REALLY CARE. BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY GOES BEYOND JUST THE PRIMARY VOTE NEW HAMPSHIRE. SO YOU CARRY THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND I LEARNED THAT THE DECEMBER AND JANUARY DOESN'T BRING UP THE BLACK ICE OCCASIONALLY, IT KICKS OFF DECISION TIME. THE MOMENT WHEN YOU GET THE CENTER STATIONED ON THE COURSE TO PRESIDENT, THE STRETCH RUN TO THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. AND FOLKS, THAT IS WHEN I LEARNED PEOPLE REALLY BUCKLE DOWN AND MAKE A DECISION. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE DECISION IS? WHO CAN BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND WHO , [APPLAUSE] AND NOT JUST IN THEORY, BUT WHO CAN GET ELECTED. WHO CAN WIN THE RACE? WHO CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AROUND THIS COUNTRY AND GET THE JOB DONE. HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WE ARE ON THE FIRST STEPS RIGHT NOW BEGINNING THE PROCESS OF THROWING THAT WRECKING CREW OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND PUTTING SOMEBODY IN THERE WHO'S GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE. I AM NOT HERE FOR ANY OLD REASON, I'M HERE BECAUSE I KNOW TO MY CORE AND MY GUT AND IN MY HEART, IN MY MIND, I'VE SEEN IT AND WORKED WITH THIS MAN, I KNOW JOE BIDEN IS THE PERSON WHO CAN BE DONALD TRUMP AND BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER AND GET THE JOB DONE. [APPLAUSE] WE SPENT 24 YEARS TOGETHER IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND THE ONLY TEAM THAT HAS BEEN MORE EFFORT COOPERATING THAN US WAS DONALD TRUMP AND VLADIMIR PUTIN. SO LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR, I AM NOT HERE, I'VE KNOWN HIM, WE GO BACK TO 1971 IN THE ANTIWAR DEMONSTRATIONS AND ALL THE EFFORTS WHEN WE DID CHANGE THE WORLD. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'VE KNOWN HIM SO LONG THAT I'M HERE, IT'S BECAUSE I'VE KNOWN HIM SO WELL. I KNOW THIS MAN AND I ALSO KNOW HAVING AT THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING OUR NATION AROUND THE WORLD. I KNOW THAT THE WORLD IS IN TROUBLE AND THE UNITED STATES ALONG WITH IT, OUR DEMOCRACY IS NOT WORKING THE WAY IT OUGHT TO BE. TOO MANY DISENFRANCHISED, TOO MANY PEOPLE SEPARATED FROM THE UPPER END OF THE UPPER LEVEL. AND ANY COUNTRY THAT SEES 51% OF ALL OF ITS EARNINGS GO TO 1% OF HIS PEOPLE IS LIVING WITH AN UNSUSTAINABLE POLITICAL EQUATION AND WE NEED A PRESIDENT LIKE JOE BIDEN TO CHANGE THAT. [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED AS SECRETARY OF STATE IS IF THE UNITED STATES IS ABSENT, OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T JUST AUTOMATICALLY STEP UP TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE, I THINK MADELEINE ALBRIGHT TOLD , CALLED IS THE INDISPENSABLE NATION. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WHILE JOE BIDEN AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WERE THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR NATION. ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, THE SOUTH CHINA SEA WHERE WE SET UP FOR FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION, COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY WHERE WE STOOD UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO BE FRANCHISED AND HAVE A VOTE. REVOLUTION AFTER REVOLUTION IN THE MIDEAST, WAR IN PLACES WE DIDN'T ASK FOR. AFGHANISTAN WERE WE PUT TOGETHER A HUGE COALITION TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF OUR NATION. ISIS, WHERE WE PUT TOGETHER THE COALITION OF 68 PLUS NATIONS TO DEFEAT ISIS. THEN RESTORE OUR SENSE OF RULE OF LAW. MY FRIENDS, WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US. IT'S WHY IT STARTED THE NEW EFFORT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS LITERALLY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE FACE BECAUSE IT IS EXISTENTIAL. SCIENCE TELLS US THAT IT IS TIME WE HAD A PRESIDENT TO THE ONLY UNDERSTANDS THE SCIENCE HE IS READING, BUT BELIEVES THE SCIENCE HE IS READING. [APPLAUSE] THE SECOND CRISIS IS TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY BUT THE SOLUTION OF THAT IS WE BEAT HIM. THIS SOLUTION CLIMATE CHANGE WILL HAVE US , THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS EXTRAORDINARILY BIG, BUT NOT REALLY THAT COMPLICATED FOLKS. SOLUTION IS ALREADY HERE, IT'S CALLED ENERGY POLICY. YOU START TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES, WE CAN WIN THIS WAR, WE CAN WIN THIS BATTLE. SO WHO CAN BRING THE PUBLIC? A QUESTION NOW IS WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE, WHO HAS THE RELATIONSHIPS. WHO HAS THE GRAVITAS AND CREDIBILITY. THE LIFT TO ON DAY ONE BE ABLE TO BRING TO THE TABLE ALL THE AUTOMAKERS AND GET THEM TO ACCELERATE THE RATE AT WHICH WE MOVED TO ELECTRIC. SOMEONE HAS TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE PUBLIC UTILITIES TO THE GOVERNORS, CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES OF OUR NATION TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM WE'VE EVER HAD. TO BEGIN TO TRANSITION FOR OUR COUNTRY THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE A SMART GRID AND BEGINS TO ALLOW US TO USE THE ENERGY. THIS ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE, DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS MISSING TODAY IS LEADERSHIP QUEST , LEADERSHIP. THE WILL TO DO THIS. I WATCHED THIS GUY CREATE WILL WIN THERE WASN'T ANY AND PROVIDE LEADERSHIP WHEN THERE WASN'T ANY. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE REALITY OF WHAT THIS ELECTION REALLY MEANS. WE NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO UNDERSTANDS THERE ARE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS FOR THE WORKING PEOPLE AND THEY ARE THERE FOR THE TAKING AND THE MAKING IF WE DO OUR JOB. THIS IS NOT SCARY. THE ONLY THING THAT SCARY IS THE UNWILLINGNESS OF THE LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES TO RECOGNIZE THE REALITY AND TO QUALITY CHINESE HOAX RATHER THAN LEAD THE NATION TO THE TABLE TO GET THE JOB DONE BRING WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO BUYS INTO THE REALITY THE GREATEST MARKET THE WORLD IS EVER KNOWN IS THE ENERGY MARKET. 4.5 BILLION USERS TODAY. IT'S GOING UP TO 9 BILLION USERS OVER THE COURSE THE NEXT THREE YEARS. IT'S ALREADY A MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR MARKET, ALREADY IN AMERICA THE FASTEST GROWING JOB IS SOLAR POWERED TECHNICIAN. THE SECOND-FASTEST JOB, WIND TURBINE TECHNICIAN. FAR MORE THAN THERE ARE INVOLVED IN THE COAL INDUSTRY AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF COAL ARE TODAY. WE NEED A PRESIDENT TO UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT GREAT INFRASTRUCTURE INITIATIVE OF OUR NATION IS TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF THIS CRISIS AND TO MAKE AMERICA, TO MAKE IOWA A PLACE WHERE YOU BECOME THE SAUDI ARABIA OF WIND POWER, NEW HAMPSHIRE PRODUCING THE TECHNOLOGIES, MAYBE EVEN THE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGIES WHERE WE TAKE CARBON DIOXIDE OUT OF THE AIR AND PUT IT TO USE. WHY DON'T WE HAVE A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR INVESTMENT EFFORT IN THAT LIKE JOHN KENNEDY ASKED US TO PUT TOGETHER TO GO TO THE MOON. NO BIDEN UNDERSTANDS THAT AND I WANTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THERE ON DAY ONE WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO CATCH UP FOR LOST TIME. THIS IS THE MAN TO DO THAT AND YOU HAVE TO HELP US GET THERE. I KNOW HOW TO HAVE SURE WORKS. [APPLAUSE] , I KNOW HOW NEW HAMPSHIRE WORKS. [APPLAUSE] IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT NEVER HAS IT BEEN MORE IMPORTANT WHETHER PRESIDENT WHO GENERALLY , GENUINELY WORKS FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS OUR COUNTRY. TOO MANY PEOPLE FIGHTING THAT MAKE UP FOR THE LOST GROUND OF 2008. WHICH BY THE WAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN BROUGHT US BACK ON THE BRINK OF THAT CRISIS. [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE REASONS I'M HERE TODAY IS I UNDERSTAND JOE BIDEN, FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, GROW UP UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGES, WHAT IT MEANS TO PAY THOSE BILLS, WHAT IT MEANS TO FIND A JOB. HIS OWN FATHER HAD TO MOVE TO DO THAT. THIS IS A MAN WHO COMES FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS, WILL FIGHT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. NOT SOMEONE NEW COMES DOWN ON A GOLDEN PLATED ESCALATOR AND PROMISES TO GET RID OF A SWAMP WHICH HE FEEDS WITH MORE ALLIGATORS THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE. [APPLAUSE] SO CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT, EXPERIENCE, WISDOM, MUSCLE MEMORY, JOE BIDEN IS LIKE THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS. FUN TO WATCH, FUN TO WATCH THE PROMISE AND POTENTIAL OF YOUNG QUARTERBACKS, BUT IN FEBRUARY, I LIKE HAVING AN EXPERIENCED QUARTERBACK LIKE TOM BRADY CALLING THAT. [APPLAUSE] WHEN CHAIRMAN BIDEN BECAME VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, HE DIDN'T JUST HAND ME A GAVEL. HE HANDED ME A LEGACY OF GETTING THINGS DONE WITH INTEGRITY AND BIPARTISANSHIP. OF SHARED EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAD TRAVELING LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES AND I'VE SERVED ON WITH ALL BUNCH OF PEOPLE, I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE CHAIRMAN OF ANY COMMITTEE. BUT I BECAME CHAIRMAN OF THAT COMMITTEE WHEN HE BECAME VICE PRESIDENT AND THEN I REMEMBERED IN 2008 WHEN RUSSIAN TANKS ROLLED IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRY CALLED GEORGIA, IT WAS CHAIRMAN JOE BIDEN WHO IMMEDIATELY PICKED UP THE PHONE, HE DID NOT PICK IT UP TO ASK FOR A PERSONAL FAVOR TO DO ANYTHING WITH AN ELECTION IN THE UNITED STATES, HE PICKED UP THE PHONE TO FIND OUT WHAT AMERICA COULD DO TO HELP THE PRESIDENT OF THAT COUNTRY AND THAT COUNTRY SURVIVE. [APPLAUSE] HE DIDN'T STOP WITH A PHONE CALL. HE GOT ON A PLANE RIGHT AWAY AND FLEW OVERNIGHT AND SAT ON A HILLTOP IN GEORGIA WITH THAT PRESIDENT OF OUR DEMOCRATIC ALLY AND HE MADE IT CLEAR, THE UNITED STATES STANDS WITH THE FORCES OF FREEDOM, NOT THE DARKNESS OF DICTATORSHIP. [APPLAUSE] SO JUST THINK ABOUT IT. WHEN RUSSIAN STOOGES IN FAKE UNIFORMS ROLLED IN EIGHT YEARS LATER, ROLLED INTO UKRAINE, CANDIDATE TRUMP ALSO HAD A TEST. IN HIS FIRST INSTINCT WAS TO SAY IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. IT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM. BASICALLY HE SAID VLADIMIR PUTIN CAN HAVE CRIMEA. ASK YOURSELVES WHEN THEY DO IT AGAIN SOMEWHERE, WHO IS DONALD TRUMP GOING TO CALL? WHAT FRIENDS DOES HE HAVE IN THE WORLD BESIDES KIM JONG-UN AND VLADIMIR PUTIN. AND I'M PRETTY SURE KIM JONG-UN ACTUALLY UNFRIENDED HIM THIS PAST WEEK. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] SO FOLKS, WE NEED A PRESIDENT LIKE BOTH , LIKE JOE BIDEN, WHO KNOWS IN HIS GUTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS ADVERSARIES AND BASHAR ADVERSARIES AND ALLIES. NOT A PRESIDENT WHO IS OPENLY MOCKED AND LAUGHED AT BY OUR CLOSEST ALLIES IN THE WORLD. SO PERSONALLY DISTURBED LIKE A CHILD AT A PLAYGROUND THAT HE PICKS UP HIS MARBLES AND GO HOMES , GOES HOME, SLINKS AWAY AND STARTS TWEETING IN SOLITUDE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO LEADS WHERE THOSE LEADERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES RESPECT TO THEM, LIKE THEM, UNDERSTAND OUR VALUES, SHARE THE SAME DIRECTION WHICH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SACRIFICE FOR IN WORLD WAR II, FOR THE WORLD WE BUILT AFTER WORLD WAR II WHICH DESERVES THE SAME LEADERSHIP TODAY AS WE GAVE IT THEM , GAVE IT THEN. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WHEN HE STANDS NEXT TO VLADIMIR PUTIN A FEW FEET , A FEW FEET AWAY, HE DOESN'T LOOK AT HIM AND SAY SOMETHING LIKE I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY RUSSIA WOULD ATTACK OUR ELECTION. AND THROW THE ENTIRE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND NET WORTH OF THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE BUS. IN ONE FELL SWOOP. I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY RUSSIA WOULD ATTACK OUR DEMOCRACY? FOR THAT STATEMENT ALONE I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY ANYONE WOULD GIVE THIS PRESIDENT FOUR MORE YEARS. [APPLAUSE] SO LET'S GET DOWN TO BASICS HERE. I WOULD LOVE TO BE, AND I KNOW THE VICE PRESIDENT WOULD, I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS ALL DAY LONG. THAT'S HOW I LEARNED THE MOST WHEN I WAS RUNNING. WE CAN'T DO THAT TODAY BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM MAKING AS CLEAR AN ARGUMENT AS I CAN. A LIFETIME OF SERVICE, I DON'T COME TO THIS LIGHTLY. NOR TO SEE. I KNOW THE VALUE OF EXPERIENCE. SINCE WHEN DID NOT MATTER? YOU ARE GOING TO ASK FOR THE MOST EXPERIENCE CAPABLE PERSON. THIS IS BIG STUFF RIGHT NOW. I'VE SEEN THIS MAN SIT IN THE SITUATION ROOM AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN TOUGH CHOICES WERE IN FRONT OF US, EBOLA AND AFRICA. WE WERE TOLD A MILLION PEOPLE WOULD DIE IN FOUR MONTHS IF WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW. BUT THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT HAVE THE COURAGE TO SEND 3000 PLUS TROOPS TO WEST AFRICA TO HELP BUILD THE CAPACITY TO DELIVER LIFE-SAVING HEALTH CARE. WE DELIVERED THAT AND A TINY FRACTION OF THOSE PEOPLE DIED OVER THE COURSE OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] THESE ARE LONELY AND TOUGH DECISIONS. I'M ASKING YOU OVER THE NEXT WEEKS, THINK ABOUT THE VALUE OF THAT EXPERIENCE IN THE CHOICES YOU MAKE IN LIFE BASED ON SOME EXPERIENCE. WHAT I BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE, JOE WAS AN ALLY FOR THE HARDEST ISSUES. DIPLOMACY TO END THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR THREAT, JOE ARE MEMBERS THIS, WE HAD THE KING OF ARABIA WAS TELLING ME AND I'M SURE HE TOLD THE VICE PRESIDENT YOU HAVE TO BOMB IRAN. THE PRESIDENT OF EGYPT, YOU MUST BOMB IRAN. THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL CAME OVER TO THE COUNTRY AND SAID I WANT PERMISSION TO BOMB IRAN. WILL YOU BACK ME UP? PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD THE INTELLIGENCE AND FORTITUDE TO SAY WE HAVE TO DO DIPLOMACY BEFORE WE TAKE YOUNG AMERICANS AND SEND THEM TO WAR. THAT'S PART OF THE TEST. I KNOW DONALD TRUMP HAS LET THE GENIE BACK OUT OF THE BOTTLE. EVERYTHING WAS FORESEEABLE AND IT WAS FORESEEN. THIS IS DANGEROUS STUFF. SO I THINK WHEN ISIS HAPPENED, THEY WERE SWEEPING ACROSS SYRIA. ABOUT TO TAKE BAGHDAD, MOUNTS IN JAR HAD THE IS EDIE'S , HAD THE , THEM ABOUT TO BE WIPED OUT. PRESIDENT OBAMA DECIDED TO SEND BOMBERS BUT WE DIDN'T JUST SEND AMERICAN BOMBERS, WE BUILD A COALITION. WE GOT THE ARAB COUNTRIES TOGETHER AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, ARAB COUNTRIES , SUNNI ARAB COUNTRIES BOMBED SUNNI ARABS BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS AT STAKE. THIS GUY WALKS AWAY, PROMISES, RATTLES THE MAN HE SAYS HE LOVES, WHO HAPPENS TO BE THE WORST TYRANT ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET. I WANT A MAN WITH RACING DECENCY AND STRENGTH WHO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHO WAS A FRIEND AND WHO ISN'T, AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN. I ASK YOU JUST TO THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JOE BIDEN AND DONALD TRUMP IS THE DIFFERENCE , THAT IS NOT DONALD TRUMP, I HOPE. [LAUGHTER] HE IS AN INTERRUPTER, A DISRUPTOR, THAT'S WHAT HE DOES. THIS IS SERIOUS. THINK ABOUT LIFESTYLE. THINK ABOUT LIFE CHOICES, THINK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF A LIFETIME. THINK ABOUT A MAN WHO LOST HIS WIFE AND CHILD, TWO KIDS, SURVIVED, DAYS AFTER HE WAS ELECTED. BEFORE HE'S EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. AND HE GETS THROUGH THAT, THINKING I SHOULD NOT GO TO THE SENATE, I'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF MY KIDS. THINK ABOUT THAT. THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS BEEN TESTED PUBLICLY. AND SO HAVE HIS SKILLS AS A LEADER. AS A SENATOR, HE STOOD UP OR CRIMINALS. HE PASSED ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS. HE WROTE ONE OF CONGRESS'S FIRST EVER CLIMATE AGREEMENTS. AGAIN AND AGAIN I SAW JOE FIGHT THE FIGHTS THAT NEEDED FIGHTING AND WOMEN. I SAY TO YOU , AND WIN THEM. I SAY TO YOU VERY SIMPLY, WE NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FOUGHT AND PASSED THE LANDMARK VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. I THINK WE NEED A PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES WHO STOOD UP AND BEAT THE NRA IN ORDER TO WIN AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. [APPLAUSE] I THINK WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN DO WHAT I SAW HIM DO, SOMETHING THAT ELUDED EVERY PRESIDENT SINCE HARRY TRUMAN AND PASS THE BIGGEST HEALTH-CARE REFORM PROGRAM IN HISTORY THAT TODAY, WE PROUDLY CALL OBAMA CARE. [APPLAUSE] AND REMEMBER THAT JOE BIDEN WAS TRUSTED PRESIDENT OBAMA ON EVERY TOP ISSUE. HE WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF THE RECOVERY ACT. HE HAD PRESIDENTIAL POWER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. THAT ACT LITERALLY SAVED US AND BROUGHT US BACK FROM ANOTHER GREAT DEPRESSION. HE WAS DESIGNATED TO FACE DOWN THE PROBLEM OF UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN POURING IN FROM CENTRAL AMERICA. REMEMBER THAT? WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS HOW TO PROTECT FOREIGNERS WITHOUT TRAMPLING ON THE RIGHTS OF OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, YOU CAN FIND AN ISSUE WHERE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH HIM. YOU CAN FIND AN ISSUE WITH ANY OF THE CANDIDATES WERE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ONE OR THE OTHER. BUT UNLESS IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH, WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN IS THAT WE ACTUALLY REMOVE DONALD TRUMP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. WHAT WE NEED TO DO , [APPLAUSE] WHEN I HEAR SOME PEOPLE DRAW THESE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN SOME OF THE CANDIDATES, I MUST SAY TO YOU, I'M TEMPTED TO BE A LITTLE BIT LIKE BUTLER AND GONE WITH THE WIND AND SAY FRANKLY, I DON'T GIVE A DAMN. THE DIFFERENCE IS WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS DECENT, WHO KNOWS HOW TO LEAD THE NATION, WHO HAS RELATIONSHIPS ALL AROUND THE WORLD, WHO ON DAY ONE CAN BEGIN TO HEAL A WOUND THAT IS BROKEN BECAUSE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE TO PULL IT APART. ALL OVER THE WORLD, PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHO WE ARE TODAY. 16 YEARS AGO, YOU VOTED FOR ME AND I THANK YOU PROFOUNDLY FOR THAT. TOGETHER IN NOVEMBER OF THAT YEAR, WE TURNED NEW HAMPSHIRE BLUE AGAIN. WE CARRIED MICHIGAN, CARRIED WISCONSIN, CARRIED PENNSYLVANIA. WE CAME WITHIN ONE STATE AND SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF VOTES OF DEFEATING A WARTIME INCUMBENT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I'M PROUD OF WHAT WE DID TOGETHER. YOU KNEW THE STAKES THEN, AND THEY ARE EVEN HIGHER NOW IN 2020. I WOULD NEVER COME HERE TO TELL ANYBODY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE HOW TO VOTE, THAT IS NOT WHAT I DO. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT I AM WORKING FOR AND WHAT I AM VOTING , WHY I AM VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN. THE WORLD IS STILL WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED IN AMERICA. IF HE GETS EIGHT YEARS, THEY WILL BE WONDERING WHO WE REALLY ARE. NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHEN YOU VOTE IN FEBRUARY, DON'T JUST SEND A MESSAGE. SEND US A PRESIDENT. SEND US A PRESIDENT WHO WILL FIGHT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. SEND US A PRESIDENT WHO WILL PUT OUR NATION BACK TOGETHER. SEND US A PRESIDENT WHO IS FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS, SEND US A PRESIDENT WHO CAN MAKE AMERICA AMERICA AGAIN. SEND US A PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK. GOOD TO BE BACK IN NASHVILLE. LET ME START OFF BY THANKING HIM FOR BEING MY FRIEND FOR SO LONG AND ALL THE HARD WORK SHE DOES IN CONGRESS AND BEING WILLING TO STAND BY ME AGAIN. YOU KNOW, JOHN HAS BEEN A FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. BUT WE'VE ALSO WORKED TOGETHER IN SOME REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT ISSUES. I ADMIRE, AND YOU ALL DO, TOO , I AM NOT GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME, BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIM WELL. BUT I ADMIRE JOHN FOR HIS COURAGE. WHAT I ADMIRE MORE THAN HIS COURAGE IS IS MORAL COURAGE. THE COURAGE TO COME BACK FROM VIETNAM AND BEGIN THE END OF A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN STARTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. [APPLAUSE] I'VE NEVER FOUND ANYBODY WITH MORE GUTS THAN JOHN. BUT YOU KNOW, THE EXPRESSION JOHN KENNEDY SAID, MORAL COURAGE IS A RARE COMMODITY THAN PHYSICAL COURAGE. JOHN HAS DEMONSTRATED BOTH. THERE IS OF THINGS THAT JOHN HAS COVERED, HE'S GIVEN THE CREDIT, SOME OF WHICH I DON'T DESERVE BECAUSE JOHN WAS THE GUY IN THE FIGHT IN SOME OF THESE FOREIGN-POLICY ISSUES. WHAT JOHN AND I HAVE INTELLECTUALLY AND POLITICALLY HAS GONE FOR A LONG TIME. YOU CHOSE VERY WELL WHEN JOHN RAN AND LIKE JOHN, I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU THAT I DESERVE YOUR VOTE. I'M TELLING YOU I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOOK ME OVER. WHERE I COME FROM, I WOULD KNOCK ON DOORS AND SAY MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR UNITED STATES SENATE. LOOK ME OVER. IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE, HELP ME OUT, IF NOT, VOTE FOR THE OTHER PERSON. BUT GIVE ME A LOOK OVER. THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING YOU TO DO. YOU ARE REALLY THE STARTING GUN IN THE PRIMARY RACE FOR THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENCY. YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE OBLIGATION. NOT TO ME, BUT TO YOURSELVES. BECAUSE WHAT YOU DO HERE IN IOWA , WHAT YOU DO HERE IN A PRIMARY, AND IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, IS SET THE TONE FOR WHO IS LIKELY TO BE THE NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND YOU ALWAYS TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, YOU REALLY DO. YOU ALWAYS TAKEN SERIOUSLY. BUT I DON'T THINK IT HAS EVER BEEN A MORE SERIOUS VOICE. NOT BECAUSE I'M RUNNING, BUT BECAUSE OF THE MAN WHO HOLDS THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT NOW. I DON'T THINK ANY OF YOU, AT LEAST I DIDN'T, I KNEW HE DIDN'T KNOW MUCH, WHEN RIGHT AFTER HE GOT ELECTED, BEFORE THAT, REMEMBER, HE SAID, I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS JOB WOULD BE HARDER THAN RUNNING A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE. [LAUGHTER] BUT HE MEANT IT. HE MEANT IT. FOLKS, THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. SO, SO, SO MUCH AT STAKE. AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF GOOD CANDIDATES TO CHOOSE FROM. AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME TOUGH CHOICES. BUT WHAT I WANT TO DO RATHER THAN TALK TO YOU ABOUT SPECIFIC ISSUES FROM HEALTH CARE TO GLOBAL WARMING WHICH IS THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO HUMANITY RIGHT NOW, JOHN TOGETHER A COALITION OF OVER 70 WORLD LEADERS, BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, THAT DEAL WITH THIS CLIMATE CRISIS. JOHN AND I AGREED, AND JOHN HAS BEEN A LEADER ON THIS IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE U.N., THE REASON WE HAVE A PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. THIS GUY PUT ALMOST 200 NATIONS TOGETHER TO SAY WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. [APPLAUSE] I SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME OF MY CAREER IN THE MIDDLE EAST, DEALING WITH IRANIANS. JOHN WAS THE GUY THAT WAS ABLE TO , JOHN WAS THE GUY ON THE GROUND. PUTTING TOGETHER THE SINGLE MOST INVASIVE REGIME OF INSPECTION THAT HAD EVER BEEN PUT TOGETHER IN ALL HUMAN HISTORY. WE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY DAY THE IRANIANS WERE DOING RELATIVE TO TRYING TO GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON. JOHN WAS ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A COALITION OF OUR ALLIES IN EUROPE ALONG WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA TO BE ABLE TO PUT A STOP TO WHAT THEY WERE DOING. AND IT WORKS. AND ALONG CAME THE GUY IN THE ART OF THE DEAL. THE ART OF THE DEAL, MY LORD. LOOK WHAT HE DID. AMERICA FIRST NOW MAKES US AMERICA ALONE. AMERICA ALONE. THE LAST THING I'M GOING TO SAY, BECAUSE I WANT TO GO TO QUESTIONS, I SAID EARLY ON, I COME OUT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. MY STATE HAS THE EIGHT LARGEST BLACK POPULATION OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION. THAT EXCITED MY PASSION AND ANGER WHEN I WAS A KID. AND THAT'S WHY I GOT SO DEEPLY INVOLVED IN MY COMMUNITY WITH THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE THE DAY AFTER WE GOT IN THROUGH SO MUCH AND ELECTED AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT WHO I WAS PROUD TO SERVE WITH, THAT WE WOULD SEE A GROUP OF PEOPLE COME OUT OF THE FIELDS CARRYING TORCHES IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA IN 2017, ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN, CHANTING ANTI-SEMITIC BILE, THE SAME EXACT BILE CHANTED IN GERMANY IN THE 30'S, CARRYING NAZI FLAGS AND TORCHES. I REALLY NEED IT. THINK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU GET HOME. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAW ON TELEVISION. THE HATRED. THE HATRED IN ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES OF AMERICA. AND A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED IN THE MELEE. AND THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED TO SPEAK TO IT AND HE SAID \"THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES.\" NO PRESIDENT, NO PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THIS GUY HAS QUOTED GEORGE WALLACE WHEN HE MEANT GEORGE WASHINGTON. THIS GUY HAS GIVEN OXYGEN TO WHITE SUPREMACY. DIVIDED THE NATION LIKE EVERYBODY, EVERY SINGLE SCAM ARTISTS OUT THERE HAS DONE WHEN TRYING TO GAIN POWER, DIVIDING US. DIVIDING PEOPLE. THE REASON I HAVE WORKED SO HARD AND SPENT SO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS IS THERE IS A MORAL CENTER OF WHO WE ARE. WHEN YOU CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS A RIGGED GAME, THEY CAN'T BENEFIT BY PLAYING BY THE RULES, THAT IS WHEN THEY BEGIN TO TAKE IT VANTAGE. FOLKS, , TAKE ADVANTAGE. FOLKS, THE WORDS PRESIDENCY USE MATTER. PEOPLE LISTEN. AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD. THE WORDS MATTER. A PRESIDENT BY HIS OR HER WORST CAN SEND A NATION TO WAR. IT CAN BRING PEACE, IT CAN MAKE MARKETS RISE OR FALL. AND ALSO, IT CAN APPEAL TO THE DEEPEST, DARKEST ELEMENTS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY AND GIVE THEM OXYGEN. THAT HAS HAPPENED HERE. SO I KNOW I INITIALLY WAS CRITICIZED FOR SAYING WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR, YOU KNOW IT ALL. WE LEARNED IN SCHOOL, WE THINK IT'S ALMOST CORNY SOMETIMES THAT WE TALK ABOUT IT, BUT IT'S REAL. WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO IT. BUT NO LEADER HAS EVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT LIKE WE HAVE NOW. EVERY GENERATION IS OPEN, THE APERTURE OF OPPORTUNITY, MORE AND MORE AND MORE. THIS GUY SHUT IT DOWN. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO. NOT ONLY FOR OUR SAKE AT HOME, BUT INTERNATIONALLY. RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA. WHEN HE SAID THOSE THINGS, REMEMBER, ANGELA MERKEL, THE CHANCELLOR OF GERMANY WONDERED OUT LOUD WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO AMERICA. OTHER LEADERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD SAID WHAT IS GOING ON? WE HAVE ALWAYS LED NOT JUST BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER. WE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. FOLKS, WE HAVE LED BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. THAT IS WHAT UNITED THE WORLD. NOW IT'S IN JEOPARDY. FOLKS, WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. A LOT OF WORK TO DO. IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE THE PRESIDENT. IT'S GOING TO BE ALL OF YOU. WHOMEVER THE NEXT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT IS, GOD WILLING. AND THE REASON WHY IT HAS GOT TO BE ALL OF YOU, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE RHETORIC, THE WAY WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO SOME DEGREE OF CIVILITY. THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO NOT ONLY BEGIN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO INHERIT A WORLD IN DISARRAY. AND THEY HAD BETTER BE READY ON DAY ONE. THEY HAD BETTER BE READY ON DAY ONE. THE REASON I'M RUNNING IS BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE. NOT IN SPITE OF IT. BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE. WITH THE HELP OF AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE, I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET MORE MAJOR LEGISLATION PASSED THAN EVERYBODY ELSE RUNNING AND THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC FIELD. THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE, BUT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET THINGS DONE. I DON'T TREAT ALL REPUBLICANS AS MY ENEMY. THIS IS NOT YOUR FATHER'S REPUBLICAN PARTY. ANY REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT VOTES TO SAY THAT THIS GUY IS BETTER THAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN, GOD ALMIGHTY. I PRAY FOR THE RETURN OF A REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO STAND ON THE WORLD STAGE AND ON DAY ONE, WHEN HE OR SHE SPEAKS,KNOW HE KNOWS WHO HE IS AND WHO THAT PERSON IS. KNOWS THAT OUR ALLIES CAN SPEAK WHEN HE OR SHE SAYS SOMETHING, THAT THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP AMERICA'S WORD. IT'S IMPORTANT. IT'S IMPORTANT. FOLKS, WHY DON'T I STOP, I'M MORE ANXIOUS TO HEAR WAS ON YOUR MIND. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR WHAT YOU'RE THINKING BECAUSE THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT YOU. IT'S NOT ABOUT ME. IT REALLY IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT MY KIDS AND MY GRANDKIDS. IT IS ABOUT THIS COUNTRY THAT IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE, MOST UNIQUE NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. BECAUSE WE WERE BUILT ON AN IDEA. UNLIKE ANY OTHER COUNTRY. AND THAT HAS TO BE RESTORED. SO AS MY MOTHER FROM SCRANTON WOULD SAY, HUSH UP AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU ALL HAVE. FIRE AWAY, RAZOR HAND. GENTLEMAN RIGHT THERE. [APPLAUSE] WHAT I SAY IS I WOULD TURN AND I WOULD SAY EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. LET ME TELL YOU WHO I AM. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. [APPLAUSE] ANYWAY, YEAH. REALLY AND TRULY, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. I NEED TO LET THEM KNOW WHO I AM, WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES. LIES. I'VE JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT I LET PEOPLE KNOW WHO I AM. [APPLAUSE] WHAT IS MY POSITION ON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE? IT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE. WE NEED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE IT AND THERE IS SOME EARLY RATIONALE FOR A. THE REASON WE GOT THE CONNECTICUT COMPROMISE WAS BECAUSE STATES LIKE NEW HAMPSHIRE AND DELAWARE AND OTHERS WHO HAVE VERY SMALL POPULATIONS, WHO HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME OF AN ELECTION, AND NO ONE WOULD SHOW UP. I STILL THINK THERE'S VALUE TO IT, BUT I DO THINK IT'S WORTH US GOING BACK AND CONSIDERING. I'VE TAUGHT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW FOR OVER 21 YEARS AND I THINK IT'S WORTHY TO BE CONSIDERED LOOKED AT AGAIN IN A SERIOUS WAY BY SCHOLARS. TO SEE IF THERE SHOULD BE ANY CHANGE OR ALTERATION TO IT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER, IT IS WHAT IT IS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT WAS NOT IN A POSITION WHERE THERE IS AN ELECTORAL COLLEGE, YOU ALL WOULD NOT GET A CHANCE TO DO ANYTHING. YOU WOULD GET TO VOTE, AND I THINK IT REQUIRES , THE WHOLE PURPOSE WAS, IF YOU REMEMBER, IS NOT ONLY TO GET THE CONSTITUTION PASSED, BUT TO BRING DISPARATE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT CONCERNS THEN PEOPLE HAVE IN MISSISSIPPI. NOT JUST ABOUT RACE, ABOUT HOW THE FOLKS IN NORTH DAKOTA HAVE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS THAN THE FOLKS IN VIRGINIA. THERE IS A REASON WE HAVE TO BRING EACH OTHER TOGETHER IN A FEDERAL SYSTEM. I'M GOING TO START TO SOUND LIKE A LAW PROFESSOR INSTEAD OF A CANDIDATE BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. WE ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH IT AND BEAT THEM BOTH WAYS, THE POPULAR VOTE AND THE ELECTORAL VOTE. [APPLAUSE] AS YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST RECKLESS PRESIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES HISTORY. BY HIS VULGAR MESSAGE AND LANGUAGE. I STROVE TO BE A POLITICIAN BUT MIGHT NOT MAKE IT DUE TO THE ABUSES OF POWER FROM THE PRESIDENT. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO DEAL WITH CHINA, AND HOW WOULD YOU REASSURE THE KURDISH FORCES AND OUR ALLIES OF OUR SUPPORT, AND WOULD YOU EVER ENDORSE A GREEN NEW DEAL? I HAVE A GREEN NEW DEAL. WE DID THE FIRST GREEN NEW DEAL. THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF HOW TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. ALL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS HAVE RATEC MY GROUP B PLUS TO A PLUS. THAT GOES WITH WHAT JOHN SAID. WHO COULD GET IT DONE? THE FIRST THING I'LL DO AS PRESIDENT BEYOND TALKING ABOUT HOW TO JOKE IS TO REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. ALL OVER THE NATION BACK TO THE UNITED STATES, JUST LIKE THE PRESIDENT DID WITH THE NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION, TO BRING THEM TO THE UNITED STATES. AMERICA SAY HERE IS THE DEAL, WE MADE A COMMITMENT. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE UP TO US. BECAUSE WE MAKE UP 50% OF THE PROBLEM , 15% OF THE PROBLEM. WITH REGARDS TO WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT, WHAT WOULD I DO ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN CHINA? THERE'S ONE MILLION MUSLIMS BEING PUT IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS IN THE WEST. I WOULD AND I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OUT ON THAT FROM THE BEGINNING. IF WE DO NOT SPEAK OUT, IF WE DO NOT SPEAK OUT ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS, NOBODY ELSE WILL. A FLASHING GREEN LIGHT, GO, GO, GO. LOOK HOW FAR OUT OF HAND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN HONG KONG HAS GOTTEN. DO YOU THINK BARACK AND I WOULD HAVE WAITED 10 SECONDS TO TALK ABOUT THAT? WE REMINDED THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT THEY MADE AN AGREEMENT. AND WE GOT THE REST OF THE WORLD TO SAY AND STAND UP FOR THE UNITED NATIONS AND SAY YOU ARE WRONG, YOU CANNOT ACT THAT WAY. AND SO YOU GOT TO SPEAK UP. IT'S NOT ABOUT SENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS TO FIGHT ANYWHERE, IT'S ABOUT MOBILIZING THE WORLD TO SAY YOU WILL PAY A PRICE THAT AT LEAST RELATES TO YOUR REPUTATION AS WELL AS POSSIBLY TRADE AND OTHER AREAS IF YOU CONTINUE TO ACT IN A WAY THAT IS EMPOWERED AND INTOLERABLE. WE'VE GOT TO SPEAK OUT. WE ARE UNDERESTIMATED THE INCREDIBLE POWER, THE MORAL POWER OF THE UNITED STATES WHEN IT SPEAKS OUT. IT HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT. FOR EXAMPLE , LOOK AT MY PHOTOGRAPHER HERE. [APPLAUSE] GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAYBE WE CAN TALK AFTERWARDS. A LITTLE BIT OF A DISTRACTION. LOOK. WE HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN A MORAL CENTER OF GRAVITY FOR THE WORLD. AND IT HAS IMPACT. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON NOW IN VENEZUELA. WE ARE SILENT. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? YOU MAY SEE COLUMBIA IN REAL TROUBLE, NOT ABLE TO HANDLE THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD ARE IN BOLIVIA , BORDER IN BOLIVIA. YOU MAY SEE THINGS THAT FUNDAMENTALLY AFFECT OUR PHYSICAL SECURITY. AND WE DON'T SAY A WORD. HE HAS NO NOTION OF WHAT TO DO. MUCH MORE TO SAY BUT I'VE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION TO THOROUGHLY. I'M NOT SURE SHE HAD MUCH CHOICE. LAST MONTH IN NOVEMBER, THE UNITED STATES RESETTLED 1400 REFUGEES AND IN OCTOBER, IT WAS ZERO FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THEY STARTED KEEPING RECORDS. MY QUESTION TO YOU AND SECRETARY KERRY WOULD BE, WHAT WOULD YOUR POLICY BE FOR RESETTLEMENT, AND WHAT IS AN IDEAL NUMBER OF REFUGEES? THE IDEAL NUMBER IS WHAT WE CAN HANDLE AND WE CAN TOLERATE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE REFUGEES WHO ARE GOING FROM OPPRESSION. I AM THE GUY THAT STARTED THE EFFORT A LONG TIME AGO TO DEAL WITH THE RESETTLEMENT OF RUSSIAN JEWS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. SERIOUSLY, THINK ABOUT IT. I WAS RAISED BY WHAT THE JEWISH COMMUNITY CALLS A RUSSIAN CHRISTIAN. MY DAD WOULD COME HOME FOR DINNER, DINNER WITH ONE TIME WE WERE ALL TOGETHER EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. HE WORKED AND CAME HOME FROM DINNER AND THEN WENT BACK TO WORK. OUR DINNER TABLE, THERE WERE TWO THINGS REQUIRED. YOU HAD TO HAVE PERFECT MANNERS. MY DAD WAS INSISTENT UPON , IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER, YOU COULD NOT COME IN WITH A TEACHER AND A BASEBALL HAT ON. YOU NEVER PUT YOUR ELBOWS ON THE TABLE, YOU HAD TO KNOW WHICH FORK TO USE. BUT THE OTHER THING MY DAD WAS ABOUT, OUR DINNER TABLE WAS A PLACE WHERE YOU HAD CONVERSATIONS AND INCIDENTALLY EIGHT. , ATE. YOU THINK I'M JOKING, I'M NOT. MY DAD USED TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE WAS A STUDENT OF THE HOLOCAUST. HE USED TO TALK ABOUT WHY DIDN'T WE BOMBED THE RAILROAD TRACKS? WHY DIDN'T WE DO THIS, WHY DIDN'T WE DO THAT? THE POINT IS THAT WHAT WE DO IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS PROFOUND IMPACT. LOOK HOW IT CHANGED THE SOVIET UNION, OUR ATTITUDE. WE SAY YOU ARE GOING TO ACT THIS WAY, WE ARE GOING TO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING. AND IT WAS NOT ABOUT NOT GOING TO WAR. WE POINTED OUT TO THE WHOLE WORLD EXACTLY WHO THEY WERE AND WHAT THEY WERE DOING. WHICH LEADS ME TO THIS LAST POINT ON THIS ISSUE. THERE'S A LOT THAT WE COULD TALK A LOT ABOUT, BUT THERE WAS A POLL IN FEBRUARY OF THIS PAST YEAR. YOU KNOW WHAT IT SAID? IT SAID THAT THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP WAS MORE RESPECTED THAN AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD. AND WE ARE JUST A CLICK ABOVE RUSSIA. WE YIELD OUR MORAL LEADERSHIP. THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT THE POWER. THE POWER OF THE MORAL LEADERSHIP WHEN WE SPEAK UP. LOOK WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO IN AFRICA. BEFORE WE ARE ABLE TO DO, BEGINNING TO CHANGE , HE IS A GOOD FRIEND, BY THE WAY. LOOK WHAT ONE HAS DONE. IT HAS CHANGED THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WHY DOES THAT MATTER? IT MATTERS IN TERMS OF GENERATING LEADERSHIP IN COUNTRIES THAT ARE ONLY NOW BEGINNING TO EMERGE, THAT LOOK TO THE UNITED STATES NOT AS A PROBLEM OR THE ENEMY, BUT AS A SOLUTION. IT MATTERS WHAT WE SAY, IT MATTERS WHAT WE DO, AND I THINK THE IDEA THAT WE ARE UNWILLING, THAT WE SAID BARACK AND I AND JOHN THOUGHT WE SHOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES, AND AT LEAST AT A MINIMUM, TEMPORARY STATUS, LIKE WE SHOULD BE DOING IN VENEZUELA NOW. WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. AND I'M THE GUY THAT WROTE THE LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE $750 MILLION TO GET THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE ALL THE MOVEMENT FROM CENTRAL AMERICA IS COMING, TO MOVE THEM IN A DIRECTION OR THEY HAD TO REPAIR THE CORRUPTION IN THEIR COUNTRIES TO GET A, HAD TO SET UP SCHOOL SYSTEMS. WE DID NOT GET ANY MONEY DIRECTLY TO THE GOVERNMENTS, THERE IS NO STREET LIGHTING IN TOUGH CITIES. ELECTRIC JUST BEING ABLE TO TURN ON. YOU FLIP A SWITCH BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE IT. WHAT HAPPENED? THE FLOW BEGAN TO DIMINISH SIGNIFICANTLY. IT'S NOT LIKE EVERYBODY SITS AROUND THE WORLD SAYING I'VE GOT A GREAT IDEA, LET'S LEAVE EVERYTHING WE KNOW, LET'S GET UP AND GO TO THE UNITED STATES. WON'T THAT BE FUN? SERIOUSLY. PEOPLE LEAVE WHAT THEY LOVE BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER LIVE THERE BECAUSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM. THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE ARE THE REPOSITORY OF EVERY LOST SOUL IN THE WORLD. BUT IT DOES MEAN WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE A MORAL LEADERSHIP TO GET THE REST OF THE WORLD UNITED. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE CAN. WHEN WE ARE UNABLE TO DEAL WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE WITH THE MASSIVE FLOWS FROM AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ AND FROM LIBYA. WE HAVE BREXIT NOW. WE HAVE A BROKEN SYSTEM IN EUROPE THAT THIS PRESIDENT THINKS SHOULD BE BROKEN ANYWAY. HYDE AMENDMENT. WHEN YOU MOVE IN A DIRECTION THAT ALL OF THE HEALTH CARE IS AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH A FEDERAL SYSTEM, THE AMENDMENT WHICH EVERY SINGLE MEMBER RUNNING FOR OFFICE HAS VOTED FOR, EVERY SINGLE ONE, THE AMENDMENT WAS DESIGNED TO SAY THAT WHEN THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY, WHEN YOU WORK CUTTING OFF EVERYTHING FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD, THEN IT MADE SENSE TO SAY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE. ONCE YOU GO OUT AND SAY MEDICARE FOR ALL OR YOU GO OUT AND YOU POSE WHAT I DO, THAT YOU INCREASE OBAMACARE AND PROVIDE A PUBLIC OPTION, THEN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THAT ROE V. WADE IS NOT AVAILABLE. AND SO I CAME OUT A WHILE AGO SAYING WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THAT AMENDMENT BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER DOABLE AND USABLE AND NO LONGER A SERIOUS OPTION FOR ANYBODY. YOU HAVE ALL THESE STATES GOING OUT AND NOT ONLY CHALLENGING WHETHER OR NOT, THEY ARE SAYING THAT IT'S A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. THE BEST WAY TO SAY IT. IF I GET ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE SUPREME COURT OVERRULED ROE V. WADE, I'M GOING TO SEND THE LEGISLATION OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO PASS AND CODIFY IT. [APPLAUSE] WHERE I COME FROM DELAWARE, TO KEEP PEOPLE STANDING MORE THAN 15 MINUTES, YOU LOSE THEM ALL. BUT LET ME CONCLUDE. LIKE I SAID, JOHN AND I GOT STARTED VERY YOUNG. WE RAN FOR OFFICE WHEN WE WERE IN OUR 20'S. I GOT ELECTED UNITED STATES SENATE BEFORE I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. I'M THE FIRST SENATOR IN FACT. I WAS ALWAYS LABELED AS THE IDEALISTIC YOUNG GUY WHO WAS OPTIMISTIC. I CAN SAY WITHOUT FEAR OF CONTRADICTION, I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES TO LEAD THE WORLD THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY CAREER. AND I MEAN IT, THINK ABOUT IT. WE ARE ALL WALKING AROUND WITH OUR HEADS DOWN LIKE, WHOA IS ME W , OE , WOE IS ME. THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THAN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. IT IS OWNED BY THE PEOPLE. EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY, LIFE ALTERING CHANGE THAT HAS COME OUT OF YOUR RESEARCH UNIVERSITY. IT DID NOT COME OUT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IT IS OWNED BY YOU, MONETIZED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WHETHER IT'S LOS ALAMOS OR ANY OTHER GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITY. AND SECONDLY, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE OUR WORKERS , I AM GOING TO TAKE YOUR QUESTION. SHE'S NOT GOING TO QUIT. LET ME FINISH MY THOUGHT HERE AND I WILL TAKE THIS LAST QUESTION. THIRDLY, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, JOHN AND I HAVE MET EVERY MAJOR WORLD LEADER. I HAVEN'T FOUND A SINGLE ONE, AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY, WOULD NOT TRADE PLACES IN A HEARTBEAT WITH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR THE PRESIDENT. A HEARTBEAT. THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE MOST ADVANCED RESEARCH PEOPLE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE MOST DIVERSE POPULATION IN A DEMOCRACY THAT GENERATES ENORMOUS INGENUITY. WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT VENTURE CAPITALISM THAT KNOWS HOW TO GET THINGS DONE. WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE WORLD. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WE ARE FORGETTING WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A SINGLE, SOLITARY AIM IN OUR HISTORY THAT WE HAVE NOT SET OUR MIND TO DO THAT WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO A COLLEGE, LITERALLY. NOT A SINGLE SOLITARY THING. MY MESSAGE ISRAEL CLEAR. LET'S GET THE HELL , MY MESSAGE IS REAL CLEAR. LET'S GET THE HELL UP AND TAKEN IT BACK AND LEAD THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN. I WILL COME OVER AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, EVERY TIME I WALK OUT OF MY GRANDFATHERS HOUSE OF IN SCRANTON, HE WOULD YELL JODEY, KEEP THE FAITH. SPREAD THE FAITH. WE CAN DO ANYTHING. [APPLAUSE] (music) (music) SERIOUSLY. IF A WOMAN STRIPPED STARK NAKED, NO MAN WOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO LAY A HAND ON HER. PERIOD. BY THE WAY, IF THE WOMAN CAN'T SAY YES, IT IS A VIOLATION AND RAPE. ONE OF THE THINGS I DID [INDISCERNIBLE] I SENT A BRILLIANT WOMAN WHO WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HELPED ME [INDISCERNIBLE] AT THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE [INDISCERNIBLE] WE REDUCED THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT OFFENSES AGAINST WOMEN MORE THAN REPORTED. [INDISCERNIBLE] HOW CAN THAT BE? TELL ME WHAT YOU MOST WANT AND THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO. [INDISCERNIBLE] YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID? OVER 50% SPONTANEOUSLY SAID [INDISCERNIBLE] THAT IS WHEN I STARTED TO [INDISCERNIBLE] BECAUSE GETTING MEN ENGAGED. THEY REMAIN SILENT. BY THE WAY, WOMEN REMAIN SILENT. [INDISCERNIBLE] YOU DON'T SAY LET ME GET INVOLVED WITH YOU, LET ME GET YOU TO A SUPPORT GROUP IF YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. STILL, PEOPLE ARE STANDING BACK. NOW YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, TENS OF THOUSANDS, SIGN A PLEDGE IF I SEE SOMETHING, I WILL DO SOMETHING. HE DOES NOT MEAN IF YOU ARE A GUY WEIGHING 140 POUNDS AND A 340 POUND FULLBACK IS MOVING ON A WOMAN, YOU CAN SAY SOMETHING. YOU CAN HOLLER. YOU CAN MENTION SOMETHING. I DO AN AWARD EVERY YEAR FOR THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO STAND UP AS ACTIVE BYSTANDERS BECAUSE THAT IS HOW I WAS RAISED. THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. [INDISCERNIBLE] IT HAS GONE DOWN SLIGHTLY. WOMEN DROPPED OFF AT COLLEGE THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR, THE LIKELIHOOD OF BEING ABUSED IS STILL ONE IN FIVE. THE SINGLE BIGGEST REASON WOMEN DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE IS BECAUSE OF PHYSICAL ABUSE. THAT IS WHY THEY LEAVE. HARASSMENT. I HAVE A SITUATION WHERE [INDISCERNIBLE] TWO YEARS AGO. A SIMPLE PROPOSITION. IF YOU ARE A FRATERNITY GUY AND GET A WOMAN DRUNK IN YOUR FRATERNITY HOUSE, FOR A LOT OF DEM WOMEN IT HAPPENS IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF SCHOOL, WHEN YOU SEE A BROTHER WALKING THAT YOUNG WOMAN UP THE STAIRS, YOU HAVE TO GO, \"NOT IN MY HOUSE.\" NOT A JOKE. YOU ARE COMPLICIT IF YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING. IT IS AMAZING WE HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE. THAT IS THE REQUIREMENT TO SIGN ON. [INDISCERNIBLE] WE HAVE TO MAKE IT CLEAR. FOR EXAMPLE, CHINA [INDISCERNIBLE] DIRTY COAL [INDISCERNIBLE] THEY ARE EXPORTING THAT IS MY POINT. NOT IN OUR COUNTRY. WE WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO CHINA, THERE ARE GOING TO BE SANCTIONS ON YOUR OPERATION JUST LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON NOW IN BRAZIL. IT IS THE RAIN FOREST. IT IS THE AMAZON. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE SENT $200 MILLION. WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, WE WOULD ORGANIZE THE WHOLE WORLD. [INDISCERNIBLE] WITH THE HELP OF THE PRESS AND OTHER WAYS. IF YOU DON'T, YOU WILL BE AT THE OTHER END OF SIGNIFICANT [INDISCERNIBLE] YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING JOE BIDEN SUPPORTERS AFTER A CAMPAIGN EVENT IN NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHERE HE APPEARED WITH JOHN KERRY WHO HAS ENDORSED HIM. WE WATCHED THIS WHILE WE WAIT FOR ANOTHER LIVE EVENT ABOUT TO GET UNDERWAY. IN A FEW MINUTES, WE EXPECT PRESIDENT CANDIDATE BERNIE SANDERS TO SPEAK AT SIMPSON COLLEGE AND INDIANOLA , IN INDIANOLA. WE EXPECT THE EVENT TO GET COMPLETELY UNDERWAY WITH THE SENATOR SHORTLY. WHILE WE WAIT, LET'S LOOK AT A SEGMENT OF THIS MORNING'S \"WASHINGTON JOURNAL.\" WE WANT TO WELCOME BACK MARC LOTTER, CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST OF THE PRESIDENTS REELECTION. GOOD SUNDAY MORNING.

FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AND 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TALKED TO IOWA ABOUT HIS PLATFORM AND JOINED BY FORMER AGRICULTURE SECRETARY AND FORMER DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF IOWA. (music) (music)(music) THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT. MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY HOLIDAYS. IT'S GREAT, IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE IN PERRY. LAST TIME WE WERE HERE WITH OUR FAMILY, IT WAS THE HOTTEST WEEK OF JULY AND RIDING OUR BIKES WHERE WE LIVE AND STAYED AT THE HOTEL AND BOWLED AND ATE GOOD FOOD AND GOT ON OUR BIKES AND WENT BACK. NICE TO BE HERE IN DECEMBER. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR COMING OUT. AND WE ARE DEMOCRATS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MET JOE AND JILL BID BIDEN 3 YEARS AGO WHEN THEY CAME TO IOWA TO CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT. I TRUST THEM AS MUCH TODAY AS I DID THEN. JOE BIDEN WAS ROCK SOLID , GO AHEAD AND CLAP. [APPLAUSE] WHAT DO I WANT FROM THE 2020 ELECTIONS? I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET UP EVERY DAY KNOWING THAT I CAN TRUST THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE WHITE HOUSE WILL KEEP IN MIND MY BEST INTERESTS AS THEY DEAL WITH ISSUES AROUND THE WORLD AND I WANT TO LOOK MY GRANDCHILDREN IN THE EYE AND KNOW THAT THEY CAN LOOK UP TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS THE AMERICAN VALUES THAT WE ALL SHARE. AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET UP EVERY MORNING AND GO ABOUT MY WORK AS AN EDUCATOR AND COMMUNITY VOLUNTEER KNOWING THAT THE PEOPLE LIVING AND WORKING IN THE WHITE HOUSE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE IN CONGRESS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT FACE US ON THE DOMESTIC LEVEL. AND I KNOW THAT JOE BIDEN IS THAT PERSON TO DO THAT. SO I WANT MY NEIGHBORS , [APPLAUSE] I WANT MY NEIGHBORS, MY FRIENDS, MY COLLEAGUES, MY FAMILY TO RESPECT THE PRESIDENT EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM. AS I MADE MY DECISION, I THOUGHT ABOUT THE PEOPLE I GREW UP WITH IN THE TOWN NEAR PERRY IN SOUTHEAST IOWA, ABOUT ANY CLASSMATES AND DIVERSE STUDENTS WHO ATTEND THE COLLEGE WHERE I SERVE ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND THE EIGHTH GRADERS THAT I TAUGHT WHO NOW HAVE EIGHTH GRADERS OF THEIR OWN AND I THOUGHT OF THE TEACHERS THAT I WORKED WITH WHERE I VOLUNTEER AND I THOUGHT OF THE PEOPLE WHERE I TRAVELED AS FIRST LADY AND THE PEOPLE IN THE 4TH DISTRICT WHERE I CAMPAIGNED FOR CONGRESS. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT DO WE NEED IN A CANDIDATE IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT I CARE ABOUT SO MUCH? AND I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS THAT WORD TRUST, WHO DO I TRUST TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF THESE PEOPLE? ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT QUALITIES THAT A CANDIDATE HAS TO HAVE IS COMPASSION. AND I HAVE SEEN JOE AND JILL BIDEN OVER THE LAST 33 YEARS REACH OUT AND COMFORT PEOPLE WHO WERE IN TROUBLE AND LOST LOVED ONES LIKE TOM AND I AND SENT CHILDREN OFF TO THE MILITARY AND DIDN'T COME HOME OR PEOPLE INVOLVED IN NATURAL DISASTERS. AND AFTER A YEAR OF LISTENING TO EVERY CANDIDATE AND I HAVE HEARD THEM ALL IN PERSON AND TOM AND I HELPED PEOPLE AND WE DEVELOPED POLICIES, I DECIDED THE PERSON WHO BEST COULD BEAT DONALD TRUMP IN 2020 IS JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MET MY FIRST PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN WHEN I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD. IF I DIDN'T HAVE REPUBLICAN FRIENDS, I WOULDN'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS AT ALL. MY DAD WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T CHANGE ME. BUT I MARRIED A GUY WHO RAN FOR PRESIDENT WHO IS SITTING BEHIND ME HERE AND I SUPPORTED MEN AND WOMEN IN THE IOWA CAUCUS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS THAT I COULD RESPECT DESPITE OF PARTY. AND I'M CHOOSING ROCK SOLID AGAIN THIS QUEER. I HOPE THAT ALL OF YOU, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T MADE UP YOUR MINDS YET WILL THINK HARD ABOUT THIS. I HOPE YOU WILL THINK ABOUT NOT WHO YOU LIKE OR WHO BEST FITS YOUR POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WON'T COME TO THE CAUCUS OR CAN'T COME TO THE CAUCUS AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE OUR INDEPENDENT AND REPUBLICAN FRIENDS A CHOICE THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO THEM. I HOPE YOU'LL THINK ABOUT THAT AS YOU ARE MAKING THAT DECISION. AND I HOPE YOU'LL THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE IT'S THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE WHO ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS CHOICE IN 2020 AND I HOPE YOU CHOOSE JOE BIDEN AND I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE HIM TO THE PODIUM, OUR FRIEND, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELLO, PERRY. THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: WELL, THEY TOLD ME THERE WOULD BE 35 TO 50 PEOPLE HERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE TIME. IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU ALL. AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT TOM AND CHRISTY, I WANT TO THANK THEM AND THEY HAVE BEEN GREAT FRIENDS. DON'T WORRY, I'M USED TO IT, OK. BABIES , SAY HI. SAY HI. GO AHEAD. DONE IT. OK. VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: THAT MAY BE THE MOST INTELLIGENT THING YOU HEAR ALL NIGHT. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. IT'S A REALLY TOUGH TIME, NOT TOUGH TIME IN TERMS OF TIME, HAVING TIME TO SPARE. WE ARE ONLY A COUPLE DAYS FROM CHRISTMAS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR MAKING THE TIME. LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING, WE HAVE BEEN ON A BUS TOUR AROUND IOWA AND NOW GOTTEN TO 23, 24 RURAL COUNTIES AND I GUESS IT'S NOW 12 DAYS. I HAVE BEEN IN ALL 99 AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, BUT TRY TO CATCH AS MANY AS WE CAN. THE FACT IS THAT YOU ALL VIEW IN IOWA, YOU TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY LISTENS TO YOU. TO BE VERY BLUNT ABOUT IT, YOU HAVE A DIFFICULT JOB RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WHO YOU SEND OUT OF IOWA WITH A PLANE TICKET, FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING TO WASHINGTON, YOU ARE GOING , IT'S GOING TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE THE PRESIDENCY AND CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THIS COUNTRY. I APPRECIATE YOU GIVING ME A LOOK. I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK FOR COMING DURING THE HOLIDAYS. THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT TIME FOR OUR FAMILIES. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I GET TO GO HOME. TONIGHT I LEAVE HERE, GET TO AN AIRPORT, GO HOME AND I ALREADY HAD FOUR OF MY GRANDDAUGHTERS CALL ME, POP, WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME? THEY LOVE ME MORE THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. THEY WOULD BE AT THE HOUSE AND MY MOTHER USED TO JEAN FINNEGAN WOULD SING AND HAVE THE KIDS GO TO SLEEP AND I CAN'T SING WORTH A DARN. BUT I WOULD PUT THE KIDS WHEN THEY WERE BABIES AND I WOULD SAY REMEMBER, THE FAVORITE PERSON IN THE WORLD IS POP. SO I WORKED VERY HARD. BUT I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE THEM AS YOU ARE ANXIOUS TO GET BACK HOME AND FINISH THE WORK YOU HAVE TO DO AT HOME. YOU KNOW, FROM THE START OF THE CAMPAIGN, I SAID SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TONIGHT. AND I HAVE SAID THAT WE NEED TO UNIFY THIS NATION. WE HAVE TO INE FILE THE COUNTRY. AND FROM THE MOMENT THE RACE, THAT WAS THE FOCUS. I WAS TOLD THAT IS A BIT NAIVE. AND I THINK IT'S EVEN MORE TRUE NOW. WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH AN IMPEACHMENT. I HAVE BEEN THERE TWICE FOR IMPEACHMENTS AND THERE IS NOTHING TO CELEBRATE ABOUT THE IMPEACHMENTS. NOTHING TO CELEBRATE AS ALL. IT IS HARD ON THE COUNTRY AND HARD ON THE PEOPLE. DON'T GET ME WRONG. TRUMP BROUGHT IT ON HIMSELF AND HE BASICALLY INDICTED HIMSELF AND THE CONGRESS HAS NO CHOICE. IT HAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO ACT, BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY EASIER ON THE COUNTRY. BUT WHAT IT DOES MEAN, THERE IS GOING TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT WORK ON UNFILING THE COUNTRY THAN ANY TIME IN MODERN HISTORY BECAUSE IT IS SO DIVIDED AND UNNECESSARILY DIVIDED AND WE HAVE TO UNFILE THE COUNTRY. MY OPPONENTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, THEY SAY I'M LIVING IN THE PAST. THEY SAY THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND I LOVE THIS ONE, THEY SAY THAT I'M NAIVE. NAIVE, REALLY? I UNDERSTAND THESE PEOPLE I THINK BETTER THAN ANYONE IN POLITICS TODAY. THE REASON I SAY THAT THERE IS NO ONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO HAS MORE REASON TO BE ANGRY WITH THE TRUMP REPUBLICAN PARTY THAN ME. AFTER ALL THE LIES AND SMEARS AND ATTACKS THEY HAVE LEVELED AT ME AND TRIED TO RUIN MY ONLY SURVIVING SON AND GONE AFTER MY FAMILY. BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME, NOT ABOUT MY FAMILY. IT IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT. IT'S ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY. AND IT IS LITERALLY OUR DEMOCRACY IS IN TROUBLE. I THINK WE ARE AT A BREAKING POINT. I DON'T THINK THAT IS AN EX AGE RATION, THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION THAT YOU WILL HAVE EVER VOTED IN THUS FAR. IT TRULY IS. YOU ALL KNOW IT. AND YOU KNOW IT IN YOUR GUT. AND FOLKS IT ISN'T NOSTALGIA, WE HAVE TO RISE ABOVE THE ATTACKS TO DO SOMETHING TO BRING THIS NATION TOGETHER. I THINK IT'S CALLED PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP TO TRY TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. AND WE DESPERATELY NEED IT. I DON'T SAY THIS BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AROUND AND WE ARE GOING TO HOLD HANDS AND SINGING EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE WONDERFUL. BUT, BUT, I SAY IT, IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET ANYTHING DONE, ONLY WAY WE CAN GET THINGS DONE FOR THESE CHILDREN HERE TONIGHT. IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT. AND LOOK, IT'S THE WAY OUR SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO WORK. IT'S THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM THAT REQUIRES CONSENSUS. NOTHING CAN GET DONE UNLESS YOU ABUSE THE CONSTITUTION AND ENGAGE IN EXECUTIVE POWER THAT YOU DON'T HAVE. IT REQUIRES US TO GET A CONSENSUS THAT WE HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. FOLKS, I'M NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE IT'S AUTOMATIC BUT HOW THE GOVERNMENT IS DESIGNED. OUR DEMOCRACY IS REALLY AT RISK. MAYBE OTHERS ARE WILLING, BUT I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION THAT WE WILL BE PERMANENTLY AT WAR WITH THE OTHER PARTY. WHAT HAPPENS TO US IF THAT'S THE CASE? WHAT HAPPENS TO US? I REFUSE TO ACCEPT IT. AND IT'S BECAUSE THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND IT'S BECAUSE THAT , IT BEGINS RIGHT HERE, BEGINS RIGHT HERE IN RURAL AMERICA, SMALL TOWN AMERICA. I PUT FORWARD AN AMBITIOUS PLAN TO REVITALIZE RURAL ECONOMIES. PEOPLE THINK I COME FROM DELAWARE, BIG CORPORATE ENTITY, THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, THE LARGEST CITY IN MY STATE IS 86,000 PEOPLE AND ONE LARGE COUNTY AND THE REMAINING TWO COUNTIES ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO VIRGINIA, THE LARGEST CITY IS 21,000 AND AFTER THAT, PROBABLY AVERAGES ABOUT 4,000, 5,000 PEOPLE BUT IT'S AGRICULTURAL BUT IT REPRESENTS THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE COUNTRY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT'S WHERE , KIND OF WHERE OUR SOUL RESIDES. ALL ALL OF YOU KNOW THINGS, WHETHER YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN, AND INDEPENDENT. I DOUBT ONE OF YOU WOULD PASS BY SOMEONE ON ONE OF YOUR RURAL ROADS HERE WITH A FLAT TIRE AND NOT STOP TO HELP THEM. NOT A JOKE. I DOUBT IF ONE OF YOUR NEIGHBORS, YOU ARE NOT CRAZY ABOUT THEM, THEY HAVE A PROBLEM, YOU TRY TO HELP. HONESTY MATTERS. IT SOUNDS CORNY. HONESTY MATTERS. YOUR WORD MATTERS. YOUR WORD MEANS SOMETHING. IT'S ABOUT WHO WE ARE. THAT IS WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY YOU ARE LITERALLY THE HEART AND THE SOUL OF THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO REBUILD RURAL AMERICA. THE POLICIES YOU HAVE BEEN UNDERGOING, WE HAVE BEEN UNDERGOING, HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING, NOT JUST FOR AGRICULTURE, BUT SMALL TOWNS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AS TOM SAYS, WHEN WE PUT TOGETHER THIS, MY RURAL PLAN, MY EGG PLAN , MY AG PLAN, IT RECOGNIZES FARMERS, YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A PLAYOFF. YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY. AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THE COMMUNITY. BE MAJOR PLAYERS IN THE WORLD FOR REAL. I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY , I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN AGRICULTURE WHO IS SAYING, ALL WE WANT, JUST PAY ME OFF. WE WILL BE FINE. I DON'T CARE WHAT I PRODUCE IN MY WORK. AG PRODUCERS SHOULD BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE, THE CUTTING EDGE OF USING LAND CONSERVATION TO STORE CARBON, TO BEGIN THE FRONTAL ATTACK ON GLOBAL WARMING, AND GETTING REWARDED FOR DOING IT, HAVING OPPORTUNITIES TO ACTUALLY GAIN , YOU WILL BE DOING FAVORS FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD AND YOU SHOULD BE REWARDED FOR IT. WE WILL INVEST IN RENEWABLE ENERGY AND BIOFUELS, CREATING MILLIONS, MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS ON THE WAY. OUR ETHANOL PLANTS PROVIDE GOOD JOBS, IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT, AND WE CAN MAKE MORE OF THAT HAPPEN WITH A NEW WAVE OF BIOFUELS. UNLESS WE YIELD TO THE OIL COMPANIES, LIKE WE HAVE SEEN HAPPEN. WE WILL INVEST IN RURAL BROADBAND. THINK OF ALL OF THE POTENTIAL THAT EXISTS IN THIS TOWN. ALL THAT POTENTIAL, SOME OF WHICH GOES UNMATCHED, UNMET. THE CHILDREN, IN SCHOOLS AND MY STATE, ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND IN MANY PLACES. YOU MAY HAVE IT HERE. MANY PLACES DON'T. AUTOMATICALLY, THEY ARE DISADVANTAGED. I DON'T CARE WHERE THEY COME FROM. THAT PHONE HAS MORE COMPUTING CAPACITY IN IT THEN TOOK MAN TO THE MOON. LITERALLY, NOT FAVORABLY. YOU EVER WATCH THESE KIDS, HOW THEY CAN HANDLE IT? THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM. BUT SOME ARE PUT AT A DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE KIND OF ACCESS, THE IMMEDIATE ACCESS THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN URBAN AREAS AND SUBURBAN AREAS. THERE IS SO MUCH POTENTIAL THAT EXISTS HERE. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO INVEST, AS I SAID. WE HAVE TO INVEST IN MAKING SURE NOT ONLY WE HAVE BROADBAND, BUT WHEN YOU HAVE BROADBAND, YOU HAVE ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE TO TELL YOU WHEN YOU CAN TRADE AND WHEN YOU CANNOT TRADE. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO. THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO WE ARE LEAVING UNDONE THAT WOULD BUILD THE WHOLE COUNTRY , NOT JUST SMALL TOWN AMERICA, BUT ALL AMERICA. YOU ARE THE SEED CORN, FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING, FOR OUR REBIRTH AS A COUNTRY. FOLKS, LOOK, I HOPE, GOD WILLING, IF WE GET ELECTED AND OUR PLAN COMES TO FRUITION, NO LONGER WILL YOU BE FACED WITH CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN BELIEVING THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN MAKE IT IS TO LEAVE HOME, TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO GET THAT GOOD JOB. THERE'S NO REASON WHY IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE. MY PLAN IS TO RESTORE THE PROMISE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR RURAL AMERICA, IN RURAL AMERICA. GIVEN THE CHOICE, THEY WOULD RATHER LIVE WHERE THEY CAN WORK, WHERE THEY CAN MAKE A LIVING, WHERE YOU CAN RAISE YOUR FAMILY. AND THAT IS BEING DENIED BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. NOW, WE PUT TOGETHER A PLAN BECAUSE WE KNOW THE PROSPERITY OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY LITERALLY DEPENDS ON COMMUNITIES LIKE PERRY. THERE'S THOUSANDS OF PERRYS ALL OVER AMERICA, ALL OVER AMERICA, WITH THE NORMA'S GOING UNMET. BUT QUITE FRANKLY, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. , WITH ENORMOUS POTENTIAL GOING ON THAT. BUT QUITE PRICKLY, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. IT'S THE CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY. HOW THE REST OF THE WORLD VIEWS US. WHAT THEY THINK OF US. WHETHER WE ARE THAT SHINING CITY ON THE HILL. WHY HAS THE REST OF THE WORLD REPAIRED TO US? WE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. IT HAS NOT BEEN THE POWER WE HAVE, BUT THE EXAMPLE. THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE THAT HAS UNITED THE WORLD. WHY DON'T PEOPLE COME? THEY COME NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE ARE ECONOMICALLY PROSPEROUS. THEY COME BECAUSE WE, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, STAND FOR THE VALUES OF THE FREE WORLD, AND THOSE YEARNING TO BE FREE, CARE ABOUT. BUT LOOK WHAT HAS HAPPENED. THE PRESIDENT TREATS MADE A LIKE IT'S A PROTECTION RACKET. HE EMBRACES THUGS , THE PRESIDENT TREATS MADE A LIKE AS A PROTECTION RACKET. HE EMBRACES THUGS. , THE PRESIDENT TREATS NATO LIKE A PRODUCTION RACKET. OUR ALLIANCES ARE FRAYING. HIS UNNECESSARY TRADE WAR HAS DECIMATED FARMERS AND PRODUCERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND PARTICULARLY THROUGHOUT THIS STATE. BUT EVEN MORE THAN HIS POLICY FAILURES, WHICH I WILL NOT KEEP TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I GET YOU KNOW THEM, BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT, EVEN WORSE, THE DAMAGE HE HAS DONE TO THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. I MEAN IT. TO THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. FANNING THE FLAMES, FANNING THE FLAMES OF THE GROUPS HERE AT HOME. FANNING THE FLAMES. THINK ABOUT IT. MY STATE HAS THE EIGHTH LARGEST BLACK POPULATION IN AMERICA. WAS SEGREGATED BY LAW. I GOT INVOLVED. I THOUGHT AFTER ALL WE WENT THROUGH, I WAS AT A STREET , I WAS AT A TRAIN STATION WHEN TO BE PICKED UP BY A BLACK MAN AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER AFTER PARTS OF MY CITY HAD BEEN TURNED TO THE GROUND, PARTS OF IT, I WAS WITTING FOR BLACK MEN TO COME 27 MILES FROM PHILADELPHIA , I WAS WAITING FOR A BLACK MAN TO COME 27 MILES FROM PHILADELPHIA TO PICK ME UP. I THOUGHT WE MADE IT. I DON'T JUST MEAN BARACK AND I HAD MADE IT. I THOUGHT THE NATION TURNED A CORNER. BUT I WAS WRONG. I DIDN'T REALIZE. HATE DOESN'T GO AWAY. IT ONLY HIDES. HIDES. WHEN IT IS GIVEN OXYGEN TO BREATHE, IT GROWS. A PRESIDENT'S WORDS MATTER. THEY CAN SEND BRIEF WOMEN AND MEN TO WAR LIKE THIS BRAVE MARINE HERE. THEY CAN SEND PEOPLE, THEY CAN BRING PEOPLE HOME. THEY CAN IN WARS. THEY CAN MAKE MARKETS RISE OR FALL. BUT THEY CAN ALSO BREED HATE THAT BRINGS OUT THE WORST ELEMENTS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY. THE HISTORY OF AMERICA IS NOT A FAIRYTALE. WHEN YOU GIVE THAT PEOPLE AUTHORITY, THINGS GET TOUGH. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING. YOU FIND WHEN YOU HAVE ICE AGENTS RIPPING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS' ARMS AT THE BORDER , MY WIFE, JILL, IS NOT HERE TODAY BECAUSE SHE JUST CROSSED THE BORDER TO MEET WITH PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN FROM TEXAS, BROWNSVILLE, TO SEE THEM HUDDLED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER, SEEKING ASYLUM. NEVER BEFORE HAVE WE REFUSED TO ALLOW ASYLUM SEEKERS TO AT LEAST COME AND HAVE A HEARING. IT'S DAMAGING US IN WAYS THAT IS HARD TO TELL. THIS IS WHO WE ARE. AND FOLKS, I BELIEVE WE CAN OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. WITH SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY, WE CAN OVERCOME IT. BUT IF WE GIVE HIM ANOTHER FOUR YEARS, I BELIEVE HE WILL PERMANENTLY ALTER THE CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY, AT LEAST SEVERAL GENERATIONS. WE CANNOT AFFORD IN THIS DANGEROUS WORLD WE FIND OURSELVES IN. SO, I AM ASKING YOU, I AM ASKING YOU TO CONSIDER JOINING ME, JOINING TOM AND CHRISTIE, JOINING IOWANS ACROSS THE STATE TO GIVE DONALD TRUMP HIS WALKING PAPERS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER COMING OUT AND CAUCUSING FOR ME ON 43RD. I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THIS. I BELIEVE WE CAN DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. , I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER COMING OUT AND CAUCUSING FOR ME ON FEBRUARY THIRD. I BELIEVE WE CAN RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. AND ONCE AGAIN, WE CAN LEAD TO THE WORLD. WE CAN OWN THE 20 CENTURY. THINK ABOUT THIS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY , NEVER. IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME WHEN AMERICA HAS SET ITS MIND TO A GOAL THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO COLLEGE. YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ANYBODY, OLD BUDDY. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. WE HAVE GOT TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NOTHING, NOTHING IS BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. SO MY DISCREET MESSAGE TO YOU IS THIS. IT'S TIME TO GET THE HECK UP. REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. AND BEGIN TO TAKE THIS OUT THAT BACK. NOW. NOW. NOW. NOW. THANK YOU. WE CAN DO IT. AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET ME INTRODUCE A BUDDY OF MINE. ONE OF THE GREATEST GUYS I KNOW. FORMER GOVERNOR AND SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE TOM. . , TOM VILSACK. GOV. VILSACK: IT IS A PRETTY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE TO SPEAK KNOWING I HAVE BETWEEN YOU AND GETTING BACK TO THOSE GRANDKIDS. AND YOU WILL HAVE BEEN PATIENT. THE STAFF HAS ASKED ME TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY I AM SUPPORTING JOE. WE HAD AN EARLIER EVENTS IN ATLANTA, AND THERE WAS A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENT AT THE CHURCH, SAW HIM AT THE CHURCH AND AT THE EVENT. IT MAY ME THINK OF MY GRANDSON JAKE. A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, HIS PARENTS CAME TO ME. WE HAD GONE THROUGH A FAMILY CRISIS. JAKE HAD HIS FIRST COMMUNION CLASS AND HIS PARENTS ASKED IF I WOULD TEACH HIM HIS FIRST COMMUNION CLASS. I GOT THE MATERIALS. I STUDIED UP. WE HAD EIGHT OR NINE SESSIONS ABOUT RECONCILIATION, CONFESSION, THE 10 COMMANDMENTS. I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE 10 COMMANDMENTS. I SAID, JAKE, IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. THE FIRST THREE ARE ABOUT HOW WE RESPECT GOD AND LOVE GOD. THE LAST SEVEN ARE ABOUT HOW WE RESPECT AND LOVE EACH OTHER. I THOUGHT I HAD TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE. I SAID, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE PASTORS AND MINISTERS IN EVANGELICAL CHURCHES AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT ARE UPSET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. JAKE SAID, WHY ARE THEY UPSET? WELL, BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT TAKES THE LORD'S NAME IN VAIN IN PUBLIC FAR TOO OFTEN. I THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE. I WAS GOING TO MOVE ON. JAKE DID NOT HESITATE A MILLISECOND AND HE SAID, AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] GOV. VILSACK: THREE QUICK REASONS I AM SUPPORTING JOE AND THE PERSONAL NOTE. JUST, YOU CAN HAVE THE GREATEST PLANS IN THE WORLD, YOU CAN HAVE THE GREATEST VISION IN THE WORLD, BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE, THE KNOWLEDGE, AND THE RELATIONSHIPS TO GET IT DONE. I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE WAS , ALL WORKING WITH THREE DIFFERENT PRESIDENTS, TWO DEMOCRATS, ONE REPUBLICAN. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO GET THINGS DONE. THERE IS NO ONE IN THIS RACE THAT HAS THE KIND OF TRANSFORMATIONAL IDEAS, PROGRESSIVE IDEAS THAT ARE DOABLE, THAT HAS THE EXPERIENCE IN THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE RELATIONSHIPS TO GET IT DONE THEN JOE BIDEN. THINK ABOUT THIS. THINK ABOUT IT. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA NEEDED SOMETHING DONE AND CONGRESS, WHEN HE NEEDED TO CONVINCE A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF CONGRESS, THIS IS THE MAN HE SENT UP TO DO THE JOB BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT JOE HAD THE RELATIONSHIPS, THE KNOWLEDGE, THE AWARENESS OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO CONVINCE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THE SENATE TO ACT. IT'S THAT EXPERIENCE, THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL ENSURE THIS RURAL PLAN THAT JOE HAS, WHICH WILL CREATE NEW REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HAMMERS, MANUFACTURING JOBS IN PLACES LIKE PERRY ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT CAN GET DONE WITH A MAN WITH HIS EXPERIENCE, KNOWLEDGE, AND RELATIONSHIPS. HE MENTIONED AMERICA'S PLACE IN THE WORLD. ON ANY GIVEN DAY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CAN BE CONFRONTED WITH THE FOLLOWING. A PANDEMIC IN AFRICA, A CYBER ATTACK IN ASIA, A GUN VIOLENCE INCIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES. ANY GIVEN DAY. THE REST OF THE WORLD NEEDS LEADERSHIP TO TACKLE ISSUES LIKE CLIMATE, TO TACKLE ISSUES LIKE CYBER ATTACKS AND TERRORISM. THE HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED , UNTIL RECENTLY , TO THE UNITED STATES FOR THAT LEADERSHIP, AND WE HAVE ALWAYS PROVIDED IT. BUT TODAY, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY. THERE IS HESITANCY. THERE IS A LACK OF AWARENESS ABOUT WHAT AMERICA STANDS FOR AND WHAT IT CARES ABOUT. FROM THE VERY FIRST MINUTE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, A NEED TO BE ABLE TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DEALING AND REPAIRING THE CREDIBILITY AND REPUTATION OF THE U.S. AND I WILL TELL YOU, THERE IS NOBODY IN THIS RACE, INCLUDING , WHO HAS , INCLUDING DONALD TRUMP, WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE AND THE JUDGMENT OF JOE BIDEN. HE CAN BEGIN ON DAY ONE. IT WILL NOT BE A YEAR OR TWO OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. HE CAN GET IT DONE. [APPLAUSE] GOV. VILSACK: BUT YOU CAN'T DO ANY OF THIS. YOU CAN'T EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WITH THE PUBLIC OPTION, YOU CANNOT FIX THE RURAL ECONOMY, YOU CANNOT REPAIR OUR NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD UNLESS YOU GET ELECTED. KIND OF A PREREQUISITE. YOU'VE GOT TO WIN. THE OTHER NIGHT BEFORE I WENT TO BED, KRISTI WAS READING, AS SHE DOES. SHE SAID, WHAT YOU DOING? , CHRISTIE WAS READING, AS SHE DOES. I SAID, I'M LOOKING AT THE POLLS. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN NORTH CAROLINA AND MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN TEXAS AND ARIZONA AND NEVADA. I WANT TO SEE WHICH CANDIDATE IN OUR CURRENT PRIMARY, WHICH CANDIDATE HAS THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF STRENGTH IN ALL THE STATES. THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE TODAY THAT IS EITHER BEATING DONALD TRUMP BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN OR IS TIED WITH DONALD TRUMP IN EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE STATES, AND THAT CANDIDATE IS HERE IN PERRY TONIGHT, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] GOV. VILSACK: JUST IMAGINE ON ELECTION NIGHT, WHEN DEMOCRATS WHEN GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA AND WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN AND TEXAS, NEVADA, ARIZONA , WE NOT ONLY WIN THE PRESIDENCY. WE WENT A LOT OF CONGRESSIONAL RACES. WE WIN A LOT OF SENATE RACES. WE BEGIN TO TURN THE CORNER ON WHAT HAS OCCURRED THE LAST THREE YEARS. THAT IS WHY I AM SUPPORTING JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] GOV. VILSACK: LET ME FINISH WITH A VERY PERSONAL NOTE. CHRISTIE MENTIONED WE HAVE UNDERGONE A TRAGEDY IN OUR FAMILY. WE LOST OUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER A FEW YEARS AGO. WHEN YOU GO THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IT KNOCKS YOU OUT. IT MAKES YOU THINK, WHAT'S THE REASON, WHAT'S THE PURPOSE? OUR SON AND DAUGHTER-IN-LAW HAVE GONE THROUGH A SERIOUS CHALLENGE. IN EARLIER THIS YEAR, JEFF WENT TO A JOE BIDEN EVENT. HE SAW HIM AND HE WENT UP TO HIM AND HE SAID, HOW ARE YOU DOING? HE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A POLITICIAN GOING, HOW ARE YOU DOING? HE ANSWERED IT LIKE, I'M FINE. JOE BIDEN STOPPED MY SON, LOOKED HIM IN THE EYE AND SAID, NO, NO, NO. I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU ARE DOING. BECAUSE YOU AND I ARE MEMBERS OF A FRATERNITY WE DID NOT CHOOSE TO BE PART OF, OF HAVING LOST A LOVED ONE. I NEED TO KNOW HOW YOU ARE DOING. I SHARE THAT STORY WITH YOU FOR TWO REASONS. THIS MAN HAS GREAT EMPATHY. IF AT THE IS SOMETHING , EMPATHY IS SOMETHING THAT A PRESENT NEEDS. THINK ABOUT IT. A PRESENT GOES INTO A GYMNASIUM OF PARENTS , A PRESIDENT GOES INTO A GYMNASIUM WITH PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN GUNNED DOWN. THAT PRESIDENT NEEDS EMPATHY. THE PRESENT GOES INTO THE OVAL OFFICE, WITH SOMEONE ON THE PHONE WHO LOST A LOVED ONE. THAT PRESIDENT NEEDS EMPATHY. THEY TORE A DEVASTATED COMMUNITY WHERE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN , THEY TOUR A DEVASTATOR IMMUNITY WHERE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN LOST, LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST. THAT PRESIDENT NEEDS TO PUT THE. NOT ONLY DO THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO SUFFER, THEY ALSO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROVIDING A SENSE OF HOPE. GETTING TO THE NEXT DAY. BEGINNING REBUILDING. MAKING SOMETHING OUT OF AN EXTRAORDINARILY TRAGIC SITUATION. I WANT MY PRESIDENT TO HAVE THAT CAPACITY. AND WE HAVE SEEN THE LAST THREE YEARS THE CURRENT PRESIDENT LACKS IF AT THE. I WANT THE COUNTRY ITSELF IS SUFFERING. , AND WE'VE SEEN THE LAST THREE YEARS THE CURRENT PRESIDENT LAX CKS EMPATHY. WE DO NOT WANT TO BE THE DISUNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE NEED SOMEONE TO TAKE US THERE. THAT REQUIRES EMPATHY. THAT REQUIRES HEART. A GREAT PRESIDENT NOT ONLY HAS TO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE, THE KNOWLEDGE, THE RELATIONSHIPS, THE AWARENESS OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WORLD. THAT PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE HEART , BECAUSE THAT'S WHO WE ARE. I AM SUPPORTING JOE BIDEN BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO CAN WIN. THE CAUSEY'S THE ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO HAS DOABLE, TRANSFORMATIONAL PLANS AND VISIONS THAT CAN GET ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE OF ITS EXPERIENCE AND RELATIONSHIPS. HE CAN BEGIN REPAIRING AMERICA'S DAMAGED IMAGE AND REPUTATION ON DAY ONE. AND BECAUSE I WILL NEVER, EVER HAVE TO WORRY IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE A PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE EMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING THAT MY PRESIDENT WILL LACK THAT. I AM ASKING YOU TO DO WHAT CHRISTIE AND I HAVE DONE IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY DONE, FILL ONE OF THESE CARDS OUT. JOE NEEDS YOU. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY NEEDS YOU. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL, THE COUNTRY NEEDS YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. MY GOODNESS. SUNDAY IN PETERBOROUGH. I TELL YOU WHAT, I LOVE THIS STATE, FOR REAL. YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THAT. I GO BACK A LONG WAY WITH A LOT OF FOLKS WHO REPRESENTED THIS STATE, AND SOME OF YOU HEARD ME SAY IT BEFORE, IT REMINDS ME OF MY HOME STATE OF DELAWARE IN ONE IMPORTANT RESPECT -- EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. MATTER OF FACT, FIRST TIME I RAN FOR THE UNITED DATES SENATE, I WAS 29 YEARS OLD DOES UNITED STATES SENATE, I WAS 29 YEARS OLD, NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN. I BETTER BE CAREFUL. BEEN A GREAT FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. BUT WHEN IRAN, MY STATE WAS A LITTLE LIKE YOURS -- -- I RAN, MY STATE WAS A LITTLE LIKE YOURS. I REMEMBER, I STARTED OFF MY CAMPAIGN IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. THEY SPEAK WITH A THICK ACCENT, FOR REAL. WE WERE A BORDER STATE, NOT SURE WHAT SIDE WE WANT TO FIGHT ON IN THOSE DAYS, FOR REAL. THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS VERY SOUTHERN. THEY TALK AT YOU LIKE YOU ARE A GOOD OLD FELLA. THE WAY YOU GO IN DELAWARE, YOU WORK YOUR WAY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. THEY SAID, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY, BECAUSE EVERYONE IS RELATED DOWN HERE. EDGAR C BENNETT -- YOU COULD NOT CALL HIM ED, IT WAS EDGAR C. IF YOU ARE NOT INVITED TO STAY IN SOMEONE'S HOME IN DELAWARE AND HAVE TO GO TO A HOTEL, YOU KNOW YOU ARE NOT REALLY THAT WELCOME. EDGAR C. SEEMED A LOT MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN I WAS, BUT WERE HAPPY TO HAVE ME TO GO. SO WE WENT TO MASS AND THEN HE WANTED ME TO GO TO HIS CHURCH IN DOWNTOWN SELBY VILLE. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH, METHODIST CHURCH, AND HAD THE GRAVEYARD IN THE FRONT LIKE THE OLD CATHOLIC CHURCH I BELONG TO IN UPSTATE DELAWARE, ST. JOSEPH'S. YOU WALK THROUGH THE HEADSTONES AND THE ENTRANCE TO GO UP. THE MINISTER WAS VERY KIND TO ME WHEN I SHOWED UP AT THE CHURCH WITH HIM. HE SAID, WE HAVE WITH US JOE BIDEN, RUNNING FOR THE UNITED EIGHTH SENATE -- UNITED STATES SENATE. HOPEFULLY HE WILL GREET THE PARISHIONERS AS THEY WALK OUT. I DID NOT EXPECT THAT, BUT I WAS VERY FLATTERED. SO I STOOD THERE WITH THE MINISTER SHAKING HANDS WITH EVERYBODY. EDGAR SEAT WAS STANDING UNDER THESE BIG OAK TREES THAT TOOK UP THE WHOLE CHURCH AREA. AFTER THE WORDS -- AFTERWARDS, I WALKED UP AND SAID, IT WENT OK. EXCEPT FOR THAT HORSE'S TAIL OVER THERE. HE SAID OF, THAT IS MY FIRST COUSIN, EDGAR. [LAUGHTER] TRUE STORY. I WANT TO GET YOUR QUESTIONS, SO I WILL BE RELATIVELY BRIEF. NUMBER ONE, THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW, BUT THE SINGLE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ISSUE YOU ON THOUGH, MR. MAYOR, IF WE GET FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP, IT IS GOING TO CHANGE WHO WE ARE AS THE CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE, I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE. IT MATTERS A LOT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO AND WHO WE ARE GOING TO PICK. WHEN I ANNOUNCED FOR THE SENATE, I DID THE SAME THING WHEN I ANNOUNCED FOR PRESIDENT, STATE MERELY WHY I WAS RUNNING WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT. THERE'S THREE REASONS. ONE, TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE I THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED, ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WITH THOSE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE WOODS, SCREECHING, THEIR VEINS BULGING, A YOUNG WOMAN GOT KILLED AND THEY ASKED THE PRESIDENT WHAT THEY THOUGHT, AND HE SAID THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO PRESIDENT HAS NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT, FOR REAL. MAYBE ANDREW JACKSON SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR, BUT NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I AM RUNNING, TO RESTORE A SENSE OF DECENCY AND HONOR. WE HOLD THOSE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THEM BEFORE. THE PRESIDENT HAS THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS WALKED AWAY FROM THEM, BECAUSE EVERY TIME, EVERY GENERATION HAS MOVED THE ARK OF CONCLUSION -- OF INCLUSION WIDER AND WIDER AND WIDER, AND IT IS BEING SHUTDOWN. I THINK IT IS BEING CORROSIVE FOR THE COUNTRY. THE SECOND REASON I SAID I WAS RUNNING, TO RESTORE THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS TAKEN A BEATING. WE USED TO BE THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD. ALL THE DATA SHOWS THAT 60% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING MAY HAVE HAD. WE HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THAT WAY BEFORE IN THE LAST CENTURY. WE HAVE NEVER LOST THAT SENSE OF OPTIMISM BEFORE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED. THIS TIME WHEN WE REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, WE HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. EVERYBODY ALONG. FROM THE DISABLED TO PEOPLE OF CALLER, AS WELL AS HARD-WORKING PEOPLE -- MY DAD WOULD SAY I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, I WANT THEM TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEM, THE GOVERNMENT. JUST GIVE ME A SHOT. THE THIRD REASON I WAS RUNNING IS BECAUSE WE HAD TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. I WAS PRETTY ROUNDLY CRITICIZED BY A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES, ALL 900 RUNNING FROM THE PRIMARY -- NO, THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE. THEY REALLY ARE. THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY WOULD SAY YEAH, JOE BIDEN USED TO BE ABLE TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER BEFORE, REMEMBER? HEATED THE ARMS CONTROL TREATIES, HE DID -- AND THEY WOULD GO THROUGH ALL THE THINGS I HAVE DONE, BUT THAT WAS THE OLD DAYS. THIS REPUBLICAN PARTY IS DIFFERENT. IT IS DIFFERENT, BUT IT WAS ONLY THREE YEARS AGO THAT WE DID A LOT OF THESE THINGS. I THINK UNIFYING THE COUNTRY IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. I DO NOT THINK IT IS NAIVE -- I UNDERSTAND THIS NEW REPUBLIC AND PARTY WELL. I HAVE BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END OF DONALD TRUMP'S BILLION DOLLARS OF ADS TRYING TO THIS MERGE MY ONLY SURVIVING SON, GOING AFTER MY FAMILY, GOING AFTER ME -- I UNDERSTAND THEM. I UNDERSTAND THEM WELL. BUT IT IS NOT ABOUT ME, IT IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM AND AROUND THE COUNTRY. PRESIDENTS SHOULD NOT HOLD GRUDGES. THEY SHOULD BE ELECTED TO RUN AND REPRESENT ALL THE PEOPLE. ALL THE PEOPLE. IMMIGRANTS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS, BECAUSE -- DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS, BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T COME TOGETHER WE CAN DO ANYTHING. THIS COUNTRY IS DESIGNED TO REQUIRE CONSENSUS. WITHOUT IT, THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN GET DONE OTHER THAN THE ABUSE OF POWER BY A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS, I CAN'T GET IT DONE THOUGH I AM JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT. I DO NOT THINK IT IS NAIVE AT ALL TO TALK ABOUT UNITING THE COUNTRY. AND THE NEED TO DO IT. I BELIEVE WE CAN, BECAUSE I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION -- SOME OF THE PEOPLE I AM RUNNING WITH IN THIS NOMINATION SAY TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE WILL BE FOREVER AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER. IT CANNOT BE SUSTAINED IN AMERICA. IT CANNOT BE SUSTAINED. IT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. [APPLAUSE] SO WE HAVE TO. WE CANNOT SURRENDER THE NOTION. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. BUT I HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF HARD THINGS DONE BEFORE. DOES NOT MEAN IT IS NOT GOING TO BE HARD THIS TIME. HERE IS THE DEAL. YOU CAN GET REPUBLICAN SOMETIMES IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE TO VOTE WITH YOU, AND WHEN YOU DON'T, YOU GO OUT AND BEAT THEM. AND I DO NOT MEAN BY GOING AFTER THEIR PERSONALITIES OR THE DIRTY POLITICS OF GOING AFTER THEIR MOTIVES. LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN AMERICAN POLITICS. EVEN SMALL STATES THAT ARE CLOSE LIKE YOURS AND MINE. WHAT HAPPENS? I COME TO YOU AND I SAY, LOOK. I THINK YOU ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG BUSINESS. I THINK YOU ARE IMMORAL. I THINK YOU ARE THIS -- BY THE WAY, LET'S WORK OUT A DEAL ON HOW WE ARE GOING TO WORKOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. FAT CHANCE. I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO FROM MIKE MANSFIELD, THE MAJORITY LEADER FROM MONTANA, MORE INTEGRITY IN HIS LITTLE FINGER THAN MOST PEOPLE HADN'T HIT THEIR WHOLE BODY -- HAD IN THEIR WHOLE BODY, FOR REAL. HE SAID IT IS NOT ALWAYS APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION A MAN OR WOMAN'S MOTIVES, BUT IT IS ALWAYS APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION THEIR JUDGMENT. YOU DO NOT KNOW THEIR MOTIVES. QUESTION THEIR JUDGMENT. THEN YOU CAN GET SOMETHING PASSED. WHEN IN FACT A LOT HAS CHANGED WITH THIS PRESIDENT. WHEN THE CARDI SHOW -- CARNIE SHOW COMES THROUGH TOWN AND YOU FIND OUT THERE ARE NO PEANUTS UNDER THE THREE SHELLS, YOU USUALLY KNOW BETTER THE SECOND TIME. -- BETTER THE SECOND TIME. [LAUGHTER] BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. WHEN IN FACT SO MUCH HAS CHANGED, I THINK THE ENVIRONMENT IS SO RIGHT FOR US TO DO SO MUCH MORE, NOT AS DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS, BUT AS A NATION. WE CAN ONLY 21ST CENTURY. WE -- OWN THE 21ST CENTURY. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC IN MY LIFE ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF THIS COUNTRY. FOLKS, LOOK. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE -- WHEN THE REPUBLICANS DISAGREE WITH US, IF I'M YOUR PRESIDENT, IF THEY DISAGREE WITH US, HERE IS THE DEAL. TAKE IT TO THEM IN THEIR DISTRICTS. CAMPAIGN. FOR EXAMPLE, I WENT TO 24 STATES AND CAMPAIGN FOR 67, 60 9 -- I AM NOT SURE THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES -- LAST TIME OUT IN 2018. THE ONLY GUY INVITED IN ALL THE STATES, FROM ALABAMA TO MONTANA TO COLORADO TO PENNSYLVANIA, STATE THAT WE LOST AND\/OR WERE CLOSE. GUESS WHAT WE DID? WE DID NOT GO AFTER THE PERSONALITIES OF THE PEOPLE WE RAN AGAINST, WE SAID WE ARE GOING TO WIN 41 FEET AND TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. WE WON 41 SEATS. BY THE WAY, FOUR ACADEMY GRADUATES, ONE THE FIRST MARINE FIGHTER PILOT, DROPPING BOMBS. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE GROUP. WHAT DID WE DO? WE SAID, ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN PEOPLE REALIZED REMEMBER, WE LOST THE HOUSE WHEN WE PASSED OBAMACARE. PEOPLE SAID, YOU LOST BECAUSE IT IS NOT POPULAR. THEN WHAT HAPPENED?THEN ALONG CAME THE REPUBLICANS IN THIS STATE AND OTHERS AND SAID, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE AWAY OBAMACARE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ANYMORE. YOU CANNOT KEEP YOUR CHILD ON YOUR HEALTH-CARE POLICY UNTIL AGE 26 ANYMORE, ETC. EVERYONE SAID WELL, WHAT? BECAUSE PEOPLE DID NOT EVEN KNOW IT WAS OBAMACARE. I SAID TO THE PRESIDENT -- I KEEP ON PICKING ON JOHN, BUT JOHN KNOWS -- MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP HERE. YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT. I GOT IN TROUBLE ARE SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE A FIRESIDE CHAT -- REMEMBER THAT? BUT THE PRESIDENT SAID, WE DON'T HAVE TIME. THERE'S TOO MANY THINGS WE HAVE TO FACE TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP. IT WASN'T UNTIL PEOPLE STARTED TO TAKE IT AWAY THAT PEOPLE STARTED TO REALIZE, WHOA. IF YOU ARE A STATE REPRESENTATIVE, GOVERNOR, YOUR SENATOR, YOUR CONGRESSMAN WANTS TO TAKE AWAY THIS THING YOU HAPPY. -- YOU HAVE. PEOPLE SAID NO. AND WE WON. WHEN YOU CANNOT CONVINCE, YOU GO OUT AND MAKE THE CASE. PEOPLE KNOW -- I AM CONCLUDING WITH THIS AND I WILL GO TO QUESTIONS, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, FROM EDUCATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE, TO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT. CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH A WHOLE RANGE OF ISSUES, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, WHICH THEY ARE TRYING TO KILL, A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. EVERYBODY WHO KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS -- I AM NOT BEING FACETIOUS. THIS IS REALITY. EVEN THE SUPPORTERS KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY KNOW WHO HE IS, PEOPLE LIKE CAM, THEY KNOW WHO HE IS. NONE OF THEM ARE ARGUING THAT THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO GROW UP WITH THE SAME CHARACTER, BUT THEY KNOW WHO HE IS. THEY DECIDED THEY LIKE HIM BECAUSE OF THINGS HE DID OR THINGS DEMOCRATS DID NOT DO OR WHATEVER. WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW THAT WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. BECAUSE HE FEEDS ON FEEDING FEARS PEOPL -- FEEDING FEAR TO PEOPLE. IF YOU SAY THE LIE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN, IT BREAKS THROUGH. IF YOU SAY IT AND SAY IT AND SAY IT -- WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. OVER FICTION. [APPLAUSE] FOR REAL. . WE GOT A LOT OF WORK CUT OUT FOR US. I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING EVERYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 15. WE OWE YOU BIG, KIDDO. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT HERE, BUT AFTER THIS IS OVER, COME UP AND TALK TO ME. EVERYBODY UNDER 15, YOU GET SOMETHING SPECIAL TODAY, BECAUSE THIS HAS TO BE BORING, BORING, BORING FOR YOU. THANK YOU. MY MOTHER WOULD OFTEN SAY JOEY, HUSH UP AND TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. SO FIRE AWAY.

THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT HERE TONIGHT, OR THIS AFTERNOON I SHOULD SAY, TO HEAR FROM ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. IT IS SO GREAT TO LIVE IN THE STATE OF IOWA, WHERE OTHER STATES WHO ARE , WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ACTIVE, TO SEE OUR REPRESENTATIVES AND SEE OUR CANDIDATES, DON'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY FORTUNATE THAT WE GET TO SEE OUR CANDIDATES UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL, AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. THEY ARE SO VERY CRITICAL FOR THE NOMINATING PROCESS. BEFORE I GET STARTED, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE A COUPLE , ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR. IVY SCHUSTER. SHE IS RUNNING FOR STATE SENATE IN OUR DISTRICT , [APPLAUSE] RUBY BALL DACA WHO IS RUNNING FOR OUR HOUSE EAT IS NOT HERE THIS AFTERNOON. SHE HAD A PREVIOUS ENGAGEMENT BUT I DO WANT TO MENTION HER. PLEASE WELCOME THEM AND GET TO KNOW THEM SO THAT YOU CAN DO A GOOD AND EDUCATED VOTE NEXT NOVEMBER FOR OUR STATEHOUSE. ONE OF THE THINGS , I WOULD NOT BE COUNTY CHAIR IF I DID NOT TAKE THE TIME TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO GET OUT AND DO CAUCUS ON FEBRUARY 3. I DON'T CARE WHO YOU SUPPORT. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT YOU GET OUT ON FEBRUARY 3 AND HAVE YOUR VOICE HEARD. THIS IS GRASSROOTS POLITICS AT THE VERY BEGINNING. AND THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON HOW OUR COUNTRY IS LEADING. SO PLEASE TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT WHERE YOUR CAUCUSES ARE, SUPPORT WHO YOU , WHOEVER YOU WANT TO SUPPORT. AND MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ISSUES ARE KNOWN WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE PLATFORM PROCESS. IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART FOR THE PROCESS THAT YOU CAN BE A PART OF. ALSO, IT DOESN'T JUST END ON FEBRUARY 3. THERE IS OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE, IN THE LOCAL PARTY, TO STAY INVOLVED. AND THAT REALLY IS WHAT WE NEED. WE NEED MORE PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO BE INVOLVED. THIS IS A PARTICIPATORY GOVERNMENT. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE, WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES AS A CITIZEN TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LEGISLATORS, OUR PRESIDENT, OUR CONGRESSPEOPLE DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY ARE GOING TO DO, AND DO WHAT IS BEST FOR OUR COUNTRY. IT IS UP TO AS TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT FEBRUARY 3, YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT UNTIL NOVEMBER AND GO OUT TO NOVEMBER AND VOTE AND FORGET ABOUT IT AGAIN. THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO EVERY DAY. ON THAT TONE ALSO, TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT YOU ARE HEARING. THERE IS, UNFORTUNATELY, WE LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE IS FAKE NEWS. WE NO LONGER CAN JUST SIT BACK AND TAKE THE FIRST THING WE SEE OR HEAR AS GOSPEL. IT TAKES US TO DO THE WORK, TO FIND OUT JUST EXACTLY WHAT IS THE TRUTH. IN THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE. IT IS JUST UNFORTUNATELY, OUR PRESENT SYSTEM IS WE HAVE TO GO LOOK FOR IT. I IMPLORE ALL OF YOU TO PAY ATTENTION, TO FIND CREDIBLE SOURCES, LISTEN TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE, AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT WRITERS BEFORE YOU START THINKING THAT YOU HAVE THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH. AND ON THAT NOTE, I HAVE THE VERY PLEASANT OPPORTUNITY HERE TO INTRODUCE OUR CONGRESSWOMAN IN THE FIRST DISTRICT, CONGRESSMAN , CONGRESSWOMAN ABBY FINKEL HOW ARE, WHO IN 2018 WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TWO WOMEN TO SERVE AND CONGRESS FOR IOWA. THIS IS WHERE THE FAKE NEWS THING COMES IN. IF YOU HAVE LIST , HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO RADIO OR TV, THEY ARE COMING AFTER ABBY. DON'T KID YOURSELF. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE BEEN SAYING IS SHE IS PART OF THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS. WE KNOW THAT IS NOT TRUE. BUT IT IS OUT THERE. MORE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED THIS LAST YEAR. BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION. AND IT IS SITTING ON MITCH MCCONNELL'S DESK IN THE SENATE. BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE ANY DEMOCRAT ANY WIN. HE IS WILLING TO HIJACK OUR COUNTRY FOR POLITICS. ABBY IS OUT THERE DOING HER WORK. SHE IS WORKING VERY HARD IN REPRESENTING US. AND WE HAVE TO GET HER REELECTED. I ASKED YOU TO REALLY DOUBLE DOWN AND DO WHAT YOU CAN TO HELP HER GET REELECTED. I ALSO HAVE THE HONOR TODAY OF INTRODUCING FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. GO AHEAD. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE KNOWN JOE BIDEN AND HIS WIFE, JILL, FOR MANY YEARS NOW. WE HAVE CRISSCROSSED OVER A LOT OF POLITICAL EVENTS OVER THE YEARS. HE HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF GETTING GOOD, POSITIVE LEGISLATION PASSED IN OUR COUNTRY, INCLUDING, BY THE WAY, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN'S ACT, WHICH IS SITTING ON MITCH MCCONNELL'S DESK BECAUSE THE HOUSE PASSED IT BY THE SENATE WILL NOT TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AND OUR OWN SENATOR TONY ERNST IS LEADING THE PATH INTO BLOCKING THAT LEGISLATION. JOE BIDEN , YEAH. JOE BIDEN WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING THAT PAST ALONG WITH MANY OTHER THINGS. HE WAS ALSO A GREAT PARTNER WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA DURING THE EIGHT YEARS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AND WILL AGAIN BE A PRESIDENT THAT WILL HAVE THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP QUALITIES THAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEED. AND ALSO THE ABILITY TO EMPATHIZE WITH PEOPLE AND TO UNDERSTAND OUR PROBLEMS THAT OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT. ABBY FINKENAUER SO PLEASE WELCOME CONGRESSWOMAN ADVISED , SO PLEASE WELCOME CONGRESSWOMAN ABBY FINKENAUER AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. (music) OH MY GOODNESS. WOW. OH MY GOSH. WELL, HELLO, VINTON. YES, YOU CAN HEAR ME. AWESOME. WHAT A CROWD. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. IT IS SO DANG COLD OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. SO THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR BRAVING THIS BEAUTIFUL IOWA WHETHER. , WEATHER. AND WE ARE HERE TODAY TO SAY HELLO TO HER NEXT PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] BEFORE I INTRODUCE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH ROSEMARY, FOR ALL THAT YOU DO, AND EVERYBODY HERE IN VINTON WHO HAS WORKED THEIR TAILS OFF THESE LAST TWO YEARS AND BEYOND, MAKING SURE THAT WE FLIPPED THIS CONGRESSIONAL SEAT AND WE TOOK BACK THAT U.S. HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] WE COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU AND I AM SO, SO GRATEFUL EVERY SINGLE DAY TO GET TO REPRESENT WAS CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN CONGRESS. I WANT TO TOUCH ON SOMETHING AND SOMEBODY I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT A LOT THE LAST FEW DAYS. WE HAVE BEEN ON THE BUS NOW FOR TWO DAYS, ANOTHER DAY TO GO TOMORROW. BUT WE STARTED IN DUBUQUE. MY HOMETOWN WHERE I GREW UP IN DUBUQUE COUNTY. MY PARENTS WERE THERE AND THERE WAS NOTABLY SOMEBODY WHO WAS NOT THAT I WISH COULD HAVE BEEN. UNFORTUNATELY, HE PASSED AWAY MANY YEARS AGO BUT HE IS SOMEBODY I THINK ABOUT OFTEN AND THAT IS MY LATE GRANDFATHER WHO WAS A FIREFIGHTER IN DUBUQUE. YOU SEE, HE IS THE GUY THAT WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, I WOULD SIT AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE WITH HIM WHEN I WAS 10 AFTER CHURCH ON SATURDAY NIGHTS AND IT WOULD BE MY GRANDFATHER WHO WAS THE FIREFIGHTER AND THE DEMOCRAT, MY UNCLE WHO WAS A DEMOCRAT AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, ANOTHER UNCLE WHO WAS A REPUBLICAN AND A LAWYER, AND ME. AND WE WOULD BE HAVING I MEAN SOME OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS CONVERSATIONS OVER THAT KITCHEN TABLE AFTER DINNER. BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU, THOSE NIGHTS LEFT A VERY IMPORTANT IMPRESSION ON MY LIFE. AND I LEARNED TWO VERY IMPORTANT LESSONS. ONE WAS EVEN THOUGH I WAS A YOUNG GIRL, I HAD EVERY RIGHT TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE WITH GROWN MEN. [APPLAUSE] SECOND, AND VERY IMPORTANT, WAS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE WOULD DISAGREE, AND AGAIN, WE SURE WOULD, WE COULD HUG EACH OTHER AT THE END OF THE NIGHT SAY, I LOVE YOU AND CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. I JUST REMEMBER THINKING THAT THAT IS HOW POLICY SHOULD BE. THAT IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS STUCK WITH ME AGAIN MY ENTIRE LIFE. AGAIN, MY GRANDFATHER, HE IS THE GUY TOO THAT I TOOK A LOT OF ADVICE FROM. WHEN ONE DAY IN 2007 I WAS SERVING AS SPEAKERS PAGE IN THE IOWA HOUSE, I WAS 18, YOU GUYS ARE MEMBER 2007. WE HAD A LOT OF CANDIDATES WE THOUGHT THEN, BUT NOW LOOK AT NOW. THERE WERE A LOT OF FOLKS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND THEY WERE COMING THROUGH THE CAPITAL. I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU, YOU GUYS KNOW THIS, BACK INTO THOUSAND SEVEN, IF YOUR LAST NAME WAS NOT OBAMA OR CLINTON, IT WAS LIKE, YOU DIDN'T KNOW EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT WAS RUNNING ALL THE TIME. ALL OF A SUDDEN, MY GRANDFATHER CALLS ME ONE DAY AND HE GOES ABBY, THERE IS THE SENATOR FROM DELAWARE THAT IS COMING TO THE CAPITAL, AND YOU HAVE GOT TO MEET HIM YOU HAVE GOT TO TALK TO HIM. HE GETS IT, HE UNDERSTANDS OUR FAMILY, HE UNDERSTANDS WHERE WE COME FROM, HE GETS IT. I WAS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW THE SENATOR FROM DELAWARE BUT IF POPPA TELLS ME, I HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE SENATOR. FROM DELAWARE. . I WILL NEVER FORGET SITTING IN THAT IOWA HOUSE CAUCUS ROOM THAT DAY AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHO JOE BIDEN WAS WALKING IN. BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU, I SURE AS HECK WHO HE WAS WHEN HE WALKED OUT. HE WAS THE GUY THAT DOES UNDERSTAND WHO WE ARE AND WHERE WE COME FROM. HE'S THE GUY WHO STICKS TO HIS VALUES, WHO CARES ABOUT PEOPLE, AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT QUITE FRANKLY HAS NEVER CHANGED. AND SOMETHING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED UP TO SINCE THAT DAY. AND IT IS WHY I BELIEVE SO MANY OF YOU RIGHT NOW IN VINTON SHOWED UP TODAY TO HEAR HIM. BECAUSE YOU GUYS KNOW THAT THAT IS WHO HE IS. THE OTHER THING YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM IS THE SAME THING THAT I KNOW ABOUT HIM, IS HE ALSO BELIEVES AND HOPE. THAT WAS THE TYPE OF STUFF THAT WE USED TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT ACT IN 2008. IT IS ALSO WHAT WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT AND 2018. AND HE GETS IT. HE UNDERSTANDS IT IS ABOUT HOPE AND THE IDEA THAT IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU SHOULDN'T JUST BE ABLE TO MAKE A LIVING, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE. AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFERENCE. [APPLAUSE] AND IT IS ABOUT HOPE IN THE IDEA THAT GOD, YOU GET SICK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY. AND HOPE AND THE IDEA, ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW, WHERE YOU CAN WORK HARD ON YOUR FAMILY FARM, PASS IT ONTO THE NEXT GENERATION WITHOUT WAKING UP EVERY SINGLE MORNING WORRIED ABOUT YOUR FUTURE BECAUSE OF A TRADE WAR THIS CURRENT PRESIDENT DECIDES TO START ON THEIR. , START ON TWITTER. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S THE STUFF THAT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN UNDERSTANDS. ANOTHER THING HE UNDERSTANDS AND IS ESPECIALLY WHY I DECIDED TO COME OUT A FEW DAYS AGO AND ENDORSE HIM FOR PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE I JUST SPENT THE LAST YEAR AND WASHINGTON WHERE I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, WE WORK ACROSS THE AISLE A LOT, ESPECIALLY ON MY COMMITTEES. I SIT ON SMALL BUSINESS, WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON A MULTITUDE OF THE BILLS. MY DAY IS VERY DIFFERENT THEN SOMETIMES YOU SEE ON TV AT NIGHT. THERE ARE ALSO TIMES WHERE I SWEAR, IT IS LIKE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE SPEAKING DIFFERENT LINKAGES. AND THERE IS NOBODY AT THE TOP WITH LEADERSHIP WHO IS WILLING TO ACTUALLY BELIEVE WE SHOULD BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST FLAWS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. AND WE HAVE SOMEBODY IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO BELIEVES THERE IS MORE VALUE IN SOWING FEAR AND DIVISION AND OUR COUNTRY THEN BRINGING US TOGETHER. AND WE HAVE HEARD IT SAID BEFORE. THE VICE PRESIDENT WILL SAY, I'M SURE YOU WILL HEAR HIM TALK ABOUT THIS, THAT PEOPLE THINK HE IS NAIVE FOR BELIEVING WE CAN UNITE THE COUNTRY. THAT WE CAN UNITE DEMOCRATS AND WE CAN UNITE CONGRESS. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, AFTER THE LAST YEAR THERE, IF WE DON'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO UNITE OUR COUNTRY, HOW TO UNITE CONGRESS, HOW TO UNITE AS A PARTY, I AM VERY, VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE AND COUNTRY, AND HE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS BELIEVED IN IT FROM DAY ONE, ALWAYS HAS AND IT IS WHY WE DESPERATELY NEED HIM IN THAT WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] ONE OTHER THING, I'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO MY GRANDPA ONE MORE TIME. HE'S THAT GUY WHO TAUGHT ME ABOUT WHAT PUBLIC SERVICE IS ALL ABOUT. BEING A FIREFIGHTER, I THINK THEY ARE SOME OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF WHAT PUBLIC SERVICE MEANS. IT'S TRUE. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE WHEN MY GRANDFATHER WOULD GET A PHONE CALL TO RUN INTO A BURNING BUILDING, HE DIDN'T CALL BACK AND ASK, WHAT COLOR IS YOUR SKIN? HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU MAKE? WHERE ARE YOU FROM? WHO DO YOU LOVE? WHAT RELIGION ARE YOU? HE JUST SHOWED UP AND HE HELPED PEOPLE AND HE DID HIS JOB. AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO EVERY SINGLE DAY AS YOUR CONGRESSWOMAN. THAT IS WHAT WE DESPERATELY NEED IN OUR U.S. SENATE. AND IT IS WHY I AM ASKING YOU TODAY TO COMMIT TO CAUCUS FOR VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN BECAUSE WE NEED THAT EXACT EXAMPLE OF PUBLIC SERVICE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] AND SO, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, IT GIVES ME A GREAT HONOR AS THE WORKING-CLASS KID FROM CHERYL, IOWA WHO GREW UP IN DUBUQUE COUNTY WHO IS NOW YOUR CONGRESSWOMAN TO GET TO ENDORSE AND INTRODUCE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE WORKING-CLASS KID FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. WELL, FOLKS, THE FOLKS IN MY HOME STATE OF DELAWARE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MONTANA AND LOUISIANA, THEY OWE YOU. YOU SENT US A FIRST CONGRESSWOMAN. YOU REALLY DID. [APPLAUSE] YOU REALLY HAVE. I HAVE A GREAT HONOR AND , IN THE 2018 ELECTION CYCLE TO GO OUT AND CAMPAIGN IN THE FOUR STATES FOR OVER ALMOST, I KEEP FORGETTING THE NUMBER, 65 TO 69, CANDIDATES. WE WON BACK THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WE WON 41 SEATS WITH LEADERS LIKE ABBY FINKENAUER. WE ELECTED A GROUP OF REALLY, REALLY, REALLY GOOD MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. FOLKS, IT MATTERS. IT MATTERS. BECAUSE IT HAS GIVEN EVERYBODY SOME HOPE AND IT HAS ALSO STEMMED THE TIDE OF SOME OF THE REALLY DANGEROUS THINGS WERE HAPPENING. BUT YOU KNOW, IT IS GETTING ABBY REELECTED THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE OWE YOU, AS I SAID, WE OWE YOU AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR ELECTING ABBY. HAVING ABBY AND CINDY AS THE FIRST TWO CONGRESSWOMEN IN THE STATE, PRETTY COOL THING. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, WE ARE AT A TIME IN THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY WHERE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS, TRUMP SUPPORTERS, INDEPENDENTS, PEOPLE WHO ARE DEMOCRATIC SUPPORTERS, THAT WE ARE REALLY AT ONE OF THOSE INFLECTION POINTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AN AWFUL LOT IS AT STAKE. AN AWFUL LOT IS AT STAKE. EMOTIONS RUN PRETTY HIGH. THEY RUN PRETTY HIGH ON BOTH SIDES. ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN'T LET HAPPEN IS WE CAN'T GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE JUST HOLLERING OUT ONE ANOTHER AND NOT TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER. THE FACT IS, WE HAVE GOTTEN TO A POINT WHERE OUR POLITICS HAS BECOME PRETTY UGLY OVER THE LAST 6, 8 YEARS. WHERE WE JUDGE PEOPLE BY WHAT WE THINK THEIR MOTIVE IS RATHER THAN THE JUDGMENT. I LEARNED EARLY ON FROM A GUY NAMED MIKE MANSFIELD WHO WAS A LEADER IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE FOR MONTANA, WHEN I WAS CRITICIZING SOMEBODY WHO HAD SOME , HAD SAID SOMETHING AWFUL ON THE SENATE FLOOR, HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID JOE, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION ANOTHER MAN OR WOMAN'S JUDGMENT, BUT NOT THEIR MOTIVE. ONCE YOU QUESTION THEIR MOTIVE, YOU CAN'T GET TO AN AGREEMENT. IF I SAY YOU ARE IN THE POCKET OF OR YOU ARE A CHEAT OR THIS OR THAT AND SAY BY THE WAY, LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE DEAL WITH THE FARMING PROBLEM, IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. WE HAVE GOT TO GET BACK TO THE SPIRIT OF DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE AGREE OR DON'T AGREE ON A SUBSTANCE, BUT WALK AWAY FROM THIS IDEA OF JUST ATTACKING THE OTHER PERSON AND ATTACKING THEIR MOTIVE, SAYING THEY ARE BAD FOLKS. WE HAVE A COUNTRY RIGHT NOW WHERE I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT, AS ABBY POINTED OUT, THAT THERE IS AN IMPORTANT BOND WE ALL HAVE. WHEN I ANNOUNCED MY CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENCY BACK EAST AND I PARTICULARLY PICKED PHILADELPHIA WHICH WAS ACROSS THE LINE FROM WHERE I LIVE IN DELAWARE, I TALKED ABOUT HOW WE USED TO, WE STARTED OFF AS A UNIQUE IDEA. WE ARE THE UNIQUE IDEA IN HISTORY. WE, THE PEOPLE, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION. NO COUNTRY HAS EVER BEEN FOUNDED ON A PRINCIPAL LIKE THAT. OR A DECLARATION, WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. THAT'S THE PRESIDENT, HE ALWAYS FORGETS. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] ALL KIDDING ASIDE, WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO THOSE PRINCIPLES. WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT BEFORE. THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN COMPLETELY INCLUSIVE, WE LEFT A LOT OF BROWN AND BLACK FOLKS OUT OF THAT EQUATION. BUT THE FOLKS, THE POINT IS, WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY BEFORE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED OF LATE IS WHEN I SAW THOSE FOLKS COME OUT OF THE FIELDS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE WITH THEIR VEINS, CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAW IN TELEVISION, THEIR VEINS BULGING, SINGING THE SAME CHANT THAT WAS SUNG IN THE STREETS OF GERMANY IN THE 1930'S ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN AND WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND THE FORMER MEMBER OF THE CLAN SAYING THIS IS WHY WE ELECTED HIM, AND A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED. WHAT HAPPENED? THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED TO COMMENT ON WHAT HAPPENED. AND HE SAID \"THERE WERE VERY, VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES.\" NO PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS A , HAS SAID ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE THAT, INCLUDING ANDREW JACKSON WHO WAS BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR. PRETTY TOUGH STUFF. THE DIVISION IN THE NATION BASED ON RACE, RELIGION, ETHNICITY, WHETHER YOU ARE FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY, HAS NEVER BEEN WHERE IT HAS BEEN BEFORE. WE HAVE TO BRING IT BACK. WE ARE A NATION THAT IS BASED ON A PRINCIPAL. PRINCIPLES. IDEAS. ONE OF THE THINGS ABBY AND I , I CAMPAIGNED FOR ABBY WHEN SHE RAN AND WON LAST TIME. . SHE IS WINNING BY 20% AND SHE WON IN SPITE OF MY SHOWING UP. [LAUGHTER] ALL KIDDING ASIDE, THINK ABOUT IT. WE ARE A PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT , LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, OUR BACKGROUNDS ARE SIMILAR. SHE USED TO EAT AT HER GRANDDAD'S TABLE ON SATURDAY. NO EXCEPTION, I'VE WRITTEN SEVERAL BOOKS ABOUT THIS, TALKING ABOUT HOW WE WOULD HAVE AFTER 10:30 MASS, EVERYBODY WOULD GO BACK TO MY GRANDPA'S KITCHEN TABLE, AND HE HAD FOUR SONS AND A DAUGHTER, AND A MAIDEN AUNT WHO LIVED WITH HIM, MY GRANDMA'S SISTER. THE WOMEN WOULD COME BACK AND BACK IN THE OLD DAYS, WOMEN HAD TEA AT THE LACE TABLECLOTH ON THE GUYS WOULD ARGUE POLITICS AND SPORTS AT THE KITCHEN TABLE. AND IF YOU ARE A BOY OR GIRL, ONLY WHEN YOU GOT AROUND 15 YEARS OLD, YOU COULD WANDER AROUND THE TABLE, YOU DIDN'T GET TO SIT DOWN. I REMEMBER MY GRANDPA TALKING ABOUT A PARTICULAR GUY WHO HAD , WHO WAS A LOCAL POLITICAL BOSS, IN EFFECT, WHO WAS , WHO HAD GOTTEN IN TROUBLE BECAUSE HE GAVE HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW OR SOMEBODY A JOB. I CAN'T REMEMBER. I REMEMBER MY GRANDPA SAYING TO ME, THE ONE THING , I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD DEFEND THIS PARTICULAR GUY. HE SAID I DEFEND HIM, I DON'T AGREE WITH THEM AT ALL, BUT I THINK WHENEVER HE SAYS HE DOES, HE SAID HE IS FOR YOU, YOU CAN BE SURE HE IS FOR YOU. YOU KNEW WHERE HE STOOD. YOU TALK ABOUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHERE PEOPLE STAND ON WHAT THEIR VALUES ARE AND WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY ARE GOING TO DO. TODAY WE CALL IT AUTHENTICITY. THE THING I LIKE ABOUT, WHAT I'VE BEEN TAUGHT AT MY TABLE AS WELL AS WHAT ABBY WAS TAUGHT IS AUTHENTICITY MATTERS. I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SOME AUTHENTICITY. IF YOU SAY WHAT YOU MEAN AND YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAY AND YOU DO WHAT YOU SAY YOU WERE GOING TO TRY, AND DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO GET IT DONE. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT NOW. WE DO HAVE TO BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. THE FACT IS THE VALUES THAT I'VE OBSERVED AND I'VE BEEN TO IOWA GOING BACK TO CAMPAIGNING FOR JOHN CULVER BACK IN THE EARLY 1970'S AS A YOUNG KID IN THE SENATE. I WAS A YOUNG KID IN THE SENATE AT THE TIME. [LAUGHTER] IOWA VALUES ARE BASICALLY AMERICAN VALUES. ESPECIALLY, IN THE REASON I HAVE SPENT SO MUCH TIME IN THE RURAL COUNTIES, I HAVE BEEN NOW 240 SOME , TO FORTY SOME. IT IS ABOUT THE THINGS THAT MATTER. IT IS ABOUT KEEPING YOUR WORD. ABOUT WHAT YOU TEACH YOUR KIDS. THAT THEY CAN BE ANYTHING THEY WANT TO BE IF THEY WORK AND PLAY BY THE RULES AND DO IT WELL. TELLING YOUR KIDS THAT NO MATTER THEIR BACKGROUND, NO MATTER WHETHER THEY COME FROM A POSITION OF INFLUENCE OR JUST ORDINARY FOLKS LIKE US, THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT IF YOU WORK HARD AT IT. THAT NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU. BUT YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE. THAT IT MATTERS. IT MATTERS YOU TREAT PEOPLE WITH DECENCY. I WILL BET YOU NOT A ONE OF YOU TONIGHT, RIDING HOME ON ONE OF THE ROADS IN THIS COUNTY, AND SOMEONE WITH A FLAT TIRE, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO STOP TO HELP. WE ARE LOSING THAT. WE ARE LOSING THAT SENSE AROUND THE COUNTRY THESE DAYS. WHERE WE ARE ISOLATED MORE AND MORE. THAT IS WHY WE ARE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME AND TRYING TO REVIVE WHAT I THINK TO BE THE THING THAT HAS MADE AMERICA AMERICA. I HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK AND MY CAREER OVERSEAS IN THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND VICE PRESIDENT DOING NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES. OVERSEAS, THEY THINK , THEY ARE KIND OF NAIVE BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE DEALS WITH, FOREIGN COUNTRIES ABOUT FAIRNESS, DECENCY. THE WORD I HEARD MORE OFTEN AT MY DADS TABLE WAS THE WORD DIGNITY. EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY, NO MATTER THEIR BACKGROUND OR WHERE THEY ARE FROM. THINK HOW THAT IS SLIPPING AWAY IN THE COUNTRY. I THINK EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT A SPECIFIC ISSUE, IT GOES TO WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE AND WHAT WE HAVE TO REESTABLISH, IN MY VIEW. TO ONCE AGAIN LEAD THE WORLD. THE FACT IS, THE STORIES OF ABBY'S FAMILY AND MY FAMILY ARE NOT VERY DIFFERENT. AND YOUR FAMILIES. WALL STREET DIDN'T BUILD AMERICA. ORDINARY AMERICANS BUILT AMERICA. AND I MIGHT ADD , [APPLAUSE] SO WHERE ARE WE NOW? WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO TO GET BACK , I KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE FRIENDS, THE CHAIRWOMAN AND I WERE SPEAKING ABOUT A FRIEND OF HERS WHO IS WORKING IN ANOTHER COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. IN LIGHT OF WHAT JUST HAPPENED WITH THE BOMBING. THIS PERSON TOLD HER HE IS COMING HOME, HE CAN'T AFFORD TO STAY WHERE HE IS NOW BECAUSE HE'S WORRIED. JUST A CAUCUS, I KNOW HE WAS COMING HOME FOR SAFETY REASONS. HE'S COMING HOME TO CAUCUS, HE MUST REALLY BE SERIOUS. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE THING VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT THE SOLA MONEYS BEING KILLED. THERE SHOULD BE NO BEING FOR THIS GUY. I KNEW OF HIM, I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN MY CAREER DEALING WITH THE CODES FORCE AND HE HEADED THAT FORCE, THE ASSASSINS ANOTHER'S IN IRAN. THE HOPE IS THAT THE PRESIDENT AT LEAST HAS A PLAN, HAS A PLAN THAT HE HAS THOUGHT THROUGH WHAT THE SECOND AND THIRD ITERATION OF THIS ARE GOING TO BE. THAT HE HAD GOTTEN SERIOUS ADVICE FROM HIS MILITARY, WHICH I DON'T KNOW YET, WHETHER OR NOT HE IS PREPARED FOR WHAT IS LIKELY TO COME, AND IT IS GOING TO, IN TERMS OF PROTECTING AMERICAN FORCES, AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS, AMERICAN PEOPLE AND EMBASSIES, ETC., AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND BECAUSE THUS FAR, HE HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED HE PAYS A LOT OF ATTENTION TO HIS ADVISORS. MOST OF THE REALLY GOOD ADVISORS, AND I'M NOT JOKING, HAVE LEFT THE ADMINISTRATION. THEY HAVE GONE SOMEWHERE ELSE. WE NEED TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE A PRESIDENT WHO WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO, ON DAY ONE, AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO , INHERIT TWO THINGS. A VERY DIVIDED COUNTRY, AS WELL AS A WORLD IN DISARRAY. AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING ON DAY ONE. THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO STAND ON JANUARY 21 AFTER BEING SWORN IN IN 2021 AND BE ABLE TO COMMAND THE RESPECT OF THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHERE THEY LOOK OUT ON EVERYONE FROM THE IRANIANS TO XI JINPING IN CHINA, TO THAT FELLA WHO CALLS HIMSELF A PRESIDENT BUT IS BECOMING SOMEWHAT OF A DICTATOR IN RUSSIA. THEY HAVE TO KNOW THAT THE PERSON TALKING TO THEM, MAN OR WOMAN, KNOWS WHO THEY ARE AND THEY KNOW WHO THAT PERSON IS. AND THEY KNOW, THEY KNOW THAT THE WORD OF THE PRESIDENT WILL BE KEPT, OUR FRIENDS WILL BE ABLE TO KNOW, THAT WE ARE WITH THEM AND OUR ENEMIES WILL BE ABLE TO KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THEIR MOTIVES AND WE ARE PREPARED. BUT FOLKS, I'M NOT AT ALL SURE WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT MORE AS WE GO ON, I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND MORE TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED RELATIVE TO IRAN. BUT THERE IS A LOT WE HAVE TO LEARN BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO WEEKS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ANY RATIONALE FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED, OTHER THAN JUST DECIDING TO TAKE HIM OUT LIKE I SAID, NOT A GOOD GUY. BUT WAS A HIGH-RANKING OFFICIAL AND WE BETTER BE PREPARED, I HOPE WE ARE PREPARED, TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PROTECT AMERICAN INTERESTS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD AND AROUND THE WORLD AND HAVE THOUGHT IT THROUGH RATHER THAN PUT US IN REAL JEOPARDY. THE LAST THING WE NEED NOW IS ANOTHER WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH NOT 6 MILLION PEOPLE OR 8 MILLION BUT 40 MILLION PEOPLE. A SOPHISTICATED COUNTRY. IT BETTER BE WORTH WHAT IN FACT HE DID, NOT AT ALL SURE THAT IS THE CASE RIGHT NOW. LOOK, ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO HERE IN IOWA, THAT THEY DON'T DO , BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE ALL FIGURED OUT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY ENVIES YOU AND IS CRAZY ABOUT YOU ALL. BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FIRST CAUCUS AND THEY ARE NOT ANY HAPPY ABOUT NEW HAMPSHIRE WHICH HAS THE FIRST PRIMARY. BECAUSE THEY SAY WE DO NOT REPRESENT THE COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT AS DIVERSE AS THE REST OF MANY OTHER STATES. SO ON AND SO FORTH. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I TELL THEM. I TELL THEM AS I GO AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT THE ONE THING ABOUT YOU ALL IS YOU TAKE YOUR JOB REALLY SERIOUSLY. YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW STATES THAT THINKS ABOUT NOT JUST WHAT I WANT FOR MY STATE, WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DETERMINING WHO GETS TO GO THROUGH THE NEXT GATE. WHO GETS TO POSSIBLY BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE YOU ELIMINATE PEOPLE IN THIS PROCESS. YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT IS NEEDED BY THE WHOLE COUNTRY. YOU THINK BEYOND YOURSELVES. YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME FOR YEARS , FOUR YEARS OF DAMAGE THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS CAUSED DOMESTICALLY AND IN FOREIGN POLICY. YOU FACT IS, AS YOU MOVE FORWARD ON THIS EFFORT, YOU WILL DETERMINE WHO GETS TO BE THE PERSON WHO MAY BE THE ONE FACING THIS PRESIDENT. YOU LOOK AT NOT ONLY WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH THEM ON AN ISSUE, BUT YOU LOOK AT THAT PERSON AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK THEY HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF BEATING DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THIS ELECTION MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT CAUCUS YOU EVER PARTICIPATED IN. NOT BECAUSE I AM RUNNING OR ANY OTHER PARTICULAR DEMOCRAT, BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT IS AT STAKE. WE CAN HANDLE WITH THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE GOODWILL OF NEIGHBORS, WE CAN HANDLE FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP AND TURN IT AROUND. BUT EIGHT YEARS? EIGHT YEARS CAN FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE. I THINK OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE. YOU SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER THAN ALMOST ANYONE IN THE COUNTRY. THE QUESTION IS, WHO IS BEST QUALIFIED AND MORE LIKELY TO BE TO THIS PRESIDENT. SECONDLY, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO BE THE PRESIDENT. WHO IS GOING TO BE MOST HELPFUL IN HELPING US WIN BACK THE UNITED STATES SENATE? [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF, IN A GENERAL ELECTION, WHO IS BEST TO HAVE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET TO BE ABLE TO WIN IN IOWA? IN ADDITION TO THAT, IT SEEMS TO BE THE NEXT THING PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT, NOT ONLY WHO IS LIKELY TO HELP US WIN THE SENATE AND WIN THE PRESIDENCY, BUT BEYOND THAT, WHO IS MOST LIKELY TO DO THE THINGS WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE TO DO? MAKE HEALTH CARE A RIGHT AT A NAIL IT DOWN SO IT IS ABLE TO BE DONE AND YOU ARE NOT IN A POSITION WHERE YOUR TAXES GET A THROUGH THE CEILING AND MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE PAY MORE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE PAID FOR ADDITIONAL INSURANCE IF THEY HAD TO PAY FOR IT. WHO IS GOING TO MAKE SURE THE EDUCATION SYSTEM, INVESTING IN OUR CHILDREN IS GOING TO GET THAT DONE? WHO IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF CLIMATE CHANGE SO WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE ABLE TO PRESERVE THIS PLANET? WHO WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT? IT TAKES LEGISLATION. THE QUESTION IS, IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO LOOK AT EACH OF OUR BACKGROUNDS AND RECORDS. WHO HAVE DONE BIG THINGS? HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO GET THINGS DONE IN THE CONGRESS? HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO GET MAJOR PIECES OF LEGISLATION PASSED? WHO WILL, IF ELECTED, BE ABLE TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC AND THE CONGRESS TO PASS THE LEGISLATION WE ARE TALKING ABOUT? THE THIRD THING IS IMPORTANT, YOU TALK ABOUT IT AND IOWA A LOT. WHO IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO UNIFY THE COUNTRY? [APPLAUSE] THE FACT IS, WE CANNOT GOVERN THIS COUNTRY, CANNOT SUSTAIN DEMOCRACY, WITHOUT ARRIVING AT A CONSENSUS. WE HAD A SYSTEM THAT IS SEPARATED POWERS, THE SENATE, HOUSE, COURT, AT A PRESIDENT. WHEN YOU CANNOT ARRIVE AT A CONSENSUS, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING UNLESS YOU ABUSE THE POWER OF THE CONSTITUTION. YOU ACT IN A WAY THAT IS BEYOND YOUR SCOPE, BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF THE LEGALITY OF A PRESIDENT. WE HAVE TO PULL IT TOGETHER. THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE DONE MY WHOLE CAREER. MY COLLEAGUES THAT ARE SEEKING THE NOMINATION POINT OUT, THAT IS TRUE, JOE BIDEN PASSED BIG THINGS, HE PUT TOGETHER THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, THE RECOVERY ACT, 900 BILLION DOLLARS WITHOUT WASTE OR FRAUD, JOE BIDEN DID ALL THESE THINGS, BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT REPUBLICAN PARTY. I UNDERSTAND THIS DIFFERENT REPUBLICAN PARTY. I DO NOT THINK ANYBODY HAS MORE REASON TO BE UPSET WITH THIS REPUBLICAN PARTY THAN I DO. THEY SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LYING ABOUT ME. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS GOING AFTER MY SURVIVING SON. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE I AM NOT THE NOMINEE. HAVE YOU SEEN A SITTING PRESIDENT MORE INTERESTED IN CHOOSING WHO THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WHO WILL BE THAT THIS PRESIDENT? I LEARNED THREE THINGS. ONE, VLADIMIR PUTIN DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE PRESIDENT. SERIOUS. THAT IS WHY FACEBOOK TOOK DOWN THOSE SPOTS AND PHONY AT THE RUSSIANS PUT UP AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IS WHY THEY TOOK THEM DOWN. SECOND, KIM JONG-UN, WHO EXCHANGES LOVE LETTERS WITH DONALD TRUMP, HIS NEWS AGENCY SAID , THIS IS THREE WEEKS OLD , JOE BIDEN IS A RABID DOG AND HE SHOULD BE BEATEN TO DEATH WITH A STICK. [LAUGHTER] THE OTHER THING, I LEARNED DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE THE NOMINEE. HIS FOLKS ARE SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY , THEY TELL ME $50 MILLION IN A NEGATIVE AD, ADS THAT ARE SO NEGATIVE, EVEN A MAINSTREAM PRESS WILL NOT PRINT THEM. SOME REAL, MOST BOLD. THEY ARE , SOME WILL, MOST WON'T. THEY ARE FLAT FLIES. I UNDERSTAND THIS NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY. I UNDERSTAND IT IS NOT ABOUT ME, IT IS ABOUT YOU. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT HAS TO BE ABLE TO NOT ONLY FIGHT, BUT BE ABLE TO SEAL. THAT IS THE ROLE OF THE PRESIDENT, TO SEAL, NOT JUST FIGHT. BRING US TOGETHER. WE CAN DO THAT. WHEN THEY TELL ME I CANNOT DO THE THINGS I WAS ABLE TO DO BEFORE AS A SENATOR AND VICE PRESIDENT AND SAY THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, IT WAS TO BE YEARS AGO. , IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO. WHAT HAPPENED WAS, THERE WAS A TEARS ACT, $9 BILLION TO DEAL WITH RESEARCH AND CANCER RESEARCH. AFTER THE PRESIDENT , THIS PRESIDENT WAS ELECTED AND BEFORE HE WAS SWORN IN, I PUT TOGETHER A GROUP OF REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND THEY SAID WE WILL NOT PASS ANYTHING ELSE WAS THE ELECTION IS OVER. THERE WERE ONLY 110 MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE WHO WERE SUPPORTING THIS ACT AND 30 OR 40 FOLKS IN THE SENATE. GUESS WHAT? TWO WEEKS BEFORE , 10 DAYS BEFORE THE PRESIDENT GOT SWORN IN, I GOT A VOTE ON THE ACT, IT GOT OVER 390 MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE TO VOTE FOR IT AND ALMOST EVERY SENATOR. IT MEANS WE ARE GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS IN HEALTH CARE. BUT MY POINT IS THIS. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO WORK ON. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. WITH DONALD TRUMP GONE, YOU WILL FIND A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS WHO WILL BE LIBERATED. I AM NOT BEING FACETIOUS. RIGHT NOW, THEY KNOW THAT IF HE IS THE PRESIDENT, HE HAS ENOUGH POWER IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHICH IS 30 SOMETHING PERCENT OF THE PUBLIC, THEY CAN BEAT YOU IN A PRIMARY. THAT DOES NOT SAY THEY ARE ENGAGED IN A PROFILE IN COURAGE, BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT IS NOT HAPPENING. THINGS CAN CHANGE. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENT IS TO PERSUADE AS WELL. NOT JUST SAY WHAT WE ARE FOR, BUT PERSUADE PEOPLE. I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACROSS THE BOARD ARE READY FOR SOMETHING TO CHANGE. THEY KNOW WE CANNOT SUSTAIN OURSELVES THIS WAY. [APPLAUSE] THERE ARE THREE THINGS I THINK ARE IMPORTANT. ONE, WE HAVE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE THE SINGLE MOST FOCUSED ISSUE FOR THIS COUNTRY AND THE WORLD IS CLIMATE THERE IS A LOT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAS TURNED GREAT PROBLEMS INTO OPPORTUNITIES. I PUT TOGETHER A PLAN, WHICH I WILL NOT DETAIL, YOU CAN TALK MORE ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT PRIVATELY, HERE IS THE DEAL. WE SHOULD BECOME THE LEADER OF THE WORLD IN TERMS OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW US TO ABSORB THAT CARBON MARKET THAT CARBON OUT OF THE AIR, DEAL WITH TECHNOLOGY , IT IS GOING TO START IN RURAL AMERICA. RAILAMERICA HAS THE CAPACITY TO , RURAL AMERICA HAS THE CAPACITY. PAY FARMERS TO ABSORB CARBON FROM THE AIR. MAKE SURE WE MOVE AND NOT GO WITH OLD COMPANIES AND MAKE SURE WE KEEP OUR COMMITMENT ON THE ISSUE OF IGO FUELS , BIOFUELS. TAKE CARBON OUT OF THE AIR. THE FIRST AND I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT, I WILL REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD WHICH I HELPED PUT TOGETHER. I WILL CALL ALMOST 200 NATIONS, I WILL CALL THEM TO THE UNITED STATES TO SIT DOWN AND UP THE ANTE. THE DEAL WE MADE WAS NOT ONLY MEET THE STANDARDS SET BY SCIENCE WHEN IT WAS FORMED, BUT THOSE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN INCREASED BECAUSE THE DANGER IS WORSE THAN IT WAS BEFORE. GET EVERYBODY TO SIGN UP TO MAKE SURE THEY KEEP THEIR COMMITMENT. IF THEY DON'T, THEY WILL PAY AN ECONOMIC PRICE. SO YOU CANNOT , CHINA CANNOT CONTINUE TO SAY WE WILL NOT INAMED, BUT HERE IS WHETHER THEY ARE DOING, THEIR BELT AND WROTE PROPOSAL, THEY ARE EXPORTING. GOAL AROUND THE WORLD THAN ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. WE MAKE UP 50% OF THE PROBLEM AND THE UNITED STATES. , 15%. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS 85%. IF WE DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE BIT OF AMBITIONS, WHICH IS NOT RATIONAL, BUT IF WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT, THE RIVERS WILL STILL FLOOD, FARMS. FLOOD, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF WITH WARMER WINTERS AND WARMER SUMMERS. YOU WILL SEE DROUGHTS, A LOT OF THINGS, BECAUSE THE 85% OF THE ANIMATORS ARE AROUND THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT REQUIRES INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. IN TERMS OF EDUCATION, BUT HAS HAPPENED. WHEN I WAS A KID, I NUMBER THE IOWA TEST. [LAUGHTER] YOU WHERE THE STANDARD FOR THE COUNTRY. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED. YOU NO LONGER ARE. YOU ARE NOWHERE NEAR THE STANDARD. LOOK WHAT WE HAVE DONE. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. WHEN SOMEONE WOULD SAY, LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I VALUE, HE WOULD SAY, DON'T TELL ME WHAT YOU VALUE, SHOW ME YOUR BUDGET, I WILL TELL YOU YOUR VALUE. ALL THESE FOLKS SAY THEY CARE ABOUT EDUCATION. THEY CUT BUDGETS. WE HAVE TO PUT EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA NO MATTER THEIR ZIP CODE OR BACKGROUND IN A POSITION TO MAKE A LIVING IN THE 21ST CENTURY. WE CAN DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] ALL THE DATA SHOWS THE GREAT UNIVERSITIES, IF A CHILD GOES TO SCHOOL, NOT DATE HERE , NOT DAYCARE, IT INCREASES BY 48% OF THE PROSPECT THEY WILL GO THROUGH 12 YEARS OF SCHOOL AND GRADUATE AND GET A DEGREE BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. THAT IS THE DATA. EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS. WE ARE THE UNITED STATES. INDOOR STATE, HOW MANY , ANYBODY TEACH IN HERE? TEACHERS? OK. HOW MANY SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS YOU HAVE AROUND TO HELP KIDS THROUGH PROBLEMS? WE HAVE ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST , THERE ARE TWO STUDIES. ONE SAYS ONE FOR EVERY 1400 KIDS AND ONE SAYS FOR EVERY 1500 KIDS. IT SHOULD BE CLOSER TO ONE TO 500 OR ONE TO 700. THE STUDIES SHOW , WE TALK ABOUT OPIOID ABUSE. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT DRUG ABUSE CAUSING MENTAL PROBLEMS. MENTAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE DRUG ABUSE. WHEN YOU IDENTIFY EARLY KIDS WHO ARE STRUGGLING, YOU CAN INTERVENE AND DO A LOT OF THINGS, NOT PUNISHED, BUT HELP. LOOK WHAT IS HAPPENING IN RURAL AMERICA IN REGARD TO HOSPITALS. 60% OF TRAUMA DEATHS OCCUR IN 20% OF THE POPULATION. WHY? IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU NEED HELP. GUESS WHAT? RURAL HOSPITALS, BECAUSE OF THE PRIVATIZATION OF MEDICARE , WHAT IS HAPPENING? HOSPITALS ARE CLOSING. HOW CAN THAT BE? HOW CAN WE ALLOW THAT? THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE IN OUR POWER TO DO AND STILL REDUCE THE DEFICIT BY GETTING RID OF RIDICULOUS TAX CUTS. AND THEY ARE NOT NECESSARY. [APPLAUSE] LASTLY, HEALTH CARE. HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW I WILL DO IT. OBAMA AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME GETTING OBAMACARE PASSED. IT WAS NOT ALL WE WANTED, BUT IT CHANGED THE LIVES OF A LOT OF PEOPLE. EVERY EVENT I GO THROUGH , GO TO, I THINK YOUR CONGRESSMAN WILL TELL YOU, PEOPLE COME UP AND SAY, YOU SAVED MY LIFE. NOT ME , OBAMACARE SAVED MY LIFE. IT DID NOT GET IT ALL DONE, BUT THERE IS AN EASY WAY TO FIX THIS. WE WANT TO ADD A PUBLIC OPTION, A MEDICARE-LIKE PROPOSAL. WHAT I AM GOING TO DO, AND I WILL GET IT PASSED, PEOPLE ARE GOOD FOLKS, BUT MEDICARE FOR ALL COSTS $40 TRILLION OVER 10 YEARS TO DO MEDICARE FOR ALL. OUR ENTIRE FEDERAL BUDGET IS $3 TRILLION OVER 10 YEARS. THAT IS MORE THAN WE SPEND ON EVERYTHING THE GOVERNMENT DOES IN ANY FORM, FROM THE MILITARY TO EDUCATION DOWN THE LINE. FOR EIGHT TO ACRE, IT WILL CAUSE AN INCREASE IN TAXES FOR MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE. BERNIE ACKNOWLEDGES , THAT IS THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO. WE NEED TO REINSTATE IT BECAUSE IN OBAMACARE, YOU CAN BUY A GOLD PLANET SO YOU NEVER HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN $1000 DEDUCTIBLE AND PROVIDE A MEDICARE OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BUY INTO THAT OPTION IF THEY WISH TO . IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, THEY ARE AUTOMATICALLY ENROLLED. IT CAN BE DONE NOW. IT COSTS $750 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. WE CAN PAY FOR IT. THERE ARE EASY WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, I WILL MAKE SURE , NOW REPUBLICANS WILL VOTE FOR WHAT I ABOUT TO SAY. RAISE THE TAX RATE BACK UP TO THE HIGHEST RATE OF 39.5 PERCENT. THAT RAISES HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. MAKING SURE , I HAVE A THINK I WILL NOT BORE YOU WITH. I HAVE A CHART YOU CAN GO ONLINE AND GET. THE THINGS I WILL DO. CAPITAL GAINS SHOULD BE TAXED AT WHAT YOUR REGULAR INCOME IS. WE SHOULD REWARD WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. IF WE DID THAT, YOU WOULD RAISE $800 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. THAT ONE THING. IF YOU MADE SURE THE CORPORATE TAX RATE WENT UP TO 28%, YOU WOULD RAISE ANOTHER $730 BILLION. WHO AMONG REPUBLICANS IS OPPOSED TO THAT? WHEN YOU SAY, AMAZON PAYS ZERO TAX. THEY MAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE ARE NOT ASKING PEOPLE TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. I GO DOWN THE LIST. WHAT WE HAVE PROPOSED, REFORMING THE TAX CODE SO MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE AT WORKING PEOPLE HAVE A WAY UP. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN MAKE SURE EVERYBODY , EAR THE BIG DEAL. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA SAY THEY LIKE THE HEALTH CARE PLAN THEY NEGOTIATED WITH THEIR EMPLOYER. THEY HAVE GIVEN UP JUST TO GET THEM, PARTICULARLY THOSE NEGOTIATED BY UNION MEMBERS. GUESS WHAT? IF YOU GO THE OTHER BOOT, YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT UP, THERE CAN BE NO PRIVATE INSURANCE. I THINK YOU KNOW BETTER THAN WASHINGTON WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU. IF ALL OF A SUDDEN YOUR COMPANY SAYS THEY WILL NOT DO INSURANCE, YOU HAVE THE MEDICARE OPTION AND THE JOE BIDEN CLAN. YOU CAN BUY INSURANCE THAT IS CHEAPER OR IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD IT, GET IT FOR FREE. EVERYBODY IS FOR THE OTHER PLAN, THEY SAY IT WILL TAKE BETWEEN FOUR YEARS TO GET A PATH AND MAYBE 10 YEARS TO GET IT DONE, A NEW STRUCTURE , COME ON. I HAVE BEEN A GREAT CONSUMER OF HEALTH CARE. UNFORTUNATELY. MY SON LAY DYING FOR 19 MONTHS WHEN HE CAME BACK FROM IRAQ. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF MY OWN DIGNITY IF I SAID TO ME BEFORE OBAMACARE, THEY COULD HAVE SAID, YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF COVERAGE, SUFFER IN PEACE FOR FIVE MONTHS. OR IF YOU HAVE A CHILD WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, OR A HUSBAND OR WIFE, YOU CANNOT GET COVERED. TALK ABOUT BEING STRIPPED OF THEIR DIGNITY. HOW DID YOU DO THAT? HOW CAN WE DO THAT? THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS , IT IS ABOUT NOW, NOT TOMORROW. IT IS ABOUT NOW. PEOPLE NEED HOPE. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE. WHEN I GOT ELECTED TO THE SENATE IN 1972, I WAS NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN YET, I HAD TO WAIT 17 DAYS TO BE ELIGIBLE. FOR REAL. I WAS A WASHINGTON, D.C., HIRING STAFF, A WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS, I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM MY FIRE DEPARTMENT. THE WOMAN THEY PUT ON THE PHONE, SHE WAS SO NERVOUS, SHE SAID TO HAVE TO COME HOME, THERE HAS BEEN AN ACCIDENT. YOUR FAMILY WAS SHOPPING AT A TRACTOR-TRAILER BROADSIDED THEM. POOR KID, SHE SAID, YOUR WIFE IS DEAD, YOUR DAUGHTER IS DEAD, YOUR TWO KIDS, I'M NOT SURE THEY WILL MAKE IT. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE WHEN I WENT HOME. LOOKING AT MY BOYS, WHO WERE ALMOST FOUR AND ALMOST FIVE. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IF THEY SAID YOU CANNOT AFFORD THIS. WHAT DO YOU DO? WHAT DOES A PARENT DO? LOOK, THIS IS NOT ABOUT TOMORROW. IT IS ABOUT TODAY, ABOUT HOPE. GIVING PEOPLE AN OPTION. I PROMISE YOU, I GUARANTEE YOU, IF I AM PRESIDENT, I WILL PROTECT YOUR FAMILIES LIKE TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE THAT IS OF PORTABLE AND GOOD AS IF IT WERE MY OWN FAMILY. I GET IT. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, BY THE WAY, LET ME MAKE CLEAR, THERE HAS BEEN A BOUT YOU WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH WHAT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH AND MORE. AND SOMETIMES YOU DID NOT HAVE THE HELP I HAD. I WAS LUCKY. MY SISTER, BROTHER, MOM, DAD HELP ME RAISE MY KIDS. THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE , I HAVE ENORMOUS REGARD FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GOT UP TODAY, PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER WITH NO HELP, DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS I OUTLINED AT OTHERS YOU UNDERSTAND. HOW MANY OF YOU LOST A FAMILY MEMBER TO CANCER? RAISE YOUR HAND. YOU GET IT. YOU KNOW. EVERYBODY DOES. THINK OF THE PEOPLE , THINK OF THE SINGLE MOMS. I WAS A SINGLE DATA FOR FIVE YEARS. WHEN I WAS A SENATOR, I WAS MAKING A DECENT SALARY. I COULD NOT AFFORD DAYCARE. IF I DID NOT HAVE MY MOM, MY SISTER, MY BROTHER , THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE, INCREDIBLE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO GET UP EVERY DAY AND DO IT EVERY DAY. THAT IS TO OUR. THESE PEOPLE DESERVE A SHOT. SAME KIND OF SHOT THAT YOU ALL WANT. FOLKS, IT IS ABOUT HOPE. THAT ME AND BY SAYING THIS. WHEN I WAS A KID, WHEN I WAS ELECTED, I WAS LABELED THIS IDEALISTIC, OPTIMISTIC, YOUNG MAN. I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES TODAY THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE. IT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. NUMBER ONE, WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD TO PROTECT US. BUT THAT IS NOT WHY THE REST OF THE WORLD RESPONSE TO US. IT IS THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER ASKED NOT TO THAT, THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. THE RAYS AND THE REST OF THE WORLD RESPONSE TO US, WE FORM A GREAT ALLIANCES BECAUSE THE REST OF THE WORLD KNOWS WHO WE ARE. OUR EXAMPLE. TO QUOTE A REPUBLICAN RONALD REAGAN, WE ARE THE SHINING CITY ON THE HILL. BUT THE LUSTER IS COMING OFF RIGHT NOW. IT IS WHO WE ARE. WE HAD MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. WHEN I DID THE CANCER INITIATIVE , WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF BEING ABLE TO CURE CANCERS. FUNDAMENTALLY, DIABETES. IF WE INVEST TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE AN ANSWER TO ALZHEIMER'S. IF WE DO NOT, GUESS WHAT? EVERY BED IN AMERICA TODAY WILL BE FILLED WITH AN ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT IN 20 YEARS AND IT WILL COST US $258 BILLION A YEAR. WE ARE NOT INVESTING IN MAKING SURE WHAT WE CAN DO AND WE CAN DO SO MUCH. EVERY MAJOR IDEA HAS COME OUT OF ONE OF THOSE RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES. THEY ARE NOT OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE OWNED BY YOU. EVERYBODY THINKS THAT IS A DEFENSE DEPARTMENT , IT IS OWNED BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS PART OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. EVERY MAJOR CHANGE HAS COME OUT OF THOSE PLACES. WE ARE BETTER STOCKED THAN ANY NATION IN THE WORLD. WITH THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST PEOPLE. THIRD, WE ARE IN A SITUATION , WE ARE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKERS IN THE WORLD. OUR WORKERS ARE THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS WORKERS IN ASIA. IT IS JUST A FACT. IF WE DO NOT CONTINUE TO INVEST IN EDUCATION AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, THAT WILL NOT LAST. IF WE DO, , WE ONLY WORLD. THE WORLD NEEDS SOMEONE LIKE THE UNITED STATES, THEY NEED A LEADER. I DO NOT MEAN PUTTING THOUSANDS OF BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO DO MORE. BUT LEADING THE WORLD IN TERMS OF BEING THE ONE WHO MOVES THE WORLD FORWARD ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. THAT IS WHO WE ARE. IF WE DO NOT, SOMEONE WILL FILL THAT VACUUM. LAST THING I WILL SAY IS , LOOK. MY COLLEGE IN THE SENATE , BRILLIANT GUY. JOHN AND OTHERS USED TO KID ME. THEY WOULD QUOTE A SENTENCE IN THE SENATE FROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S GOING TO BE MOVING SPEECH. THERE IS ONE SENTENCE I WOULD QUOTE ALL THE TIME. MY COLLEAGUES GOT TIRED OF HEARING ME DO IT. IT IS ONE THAT HARDLY GETS QUOTED AND MET THE MOST TO ME. HE ANSWERED A QUESTION WHICH WAS NOT ASKED. IT WAS IMPLICIT. WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? HE SAID, WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE WE AS AMERICANS REFUSE TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO. I REFUSED TO POSTPONE ANY LONGER THE PROMISE OF THIS COUNTRY, IT IS TIME WE REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE SET OUR MIND TO DO WE HAVE BEEN ON ABLE TO DO. IT IS TIME TO GET UP, TAKE IT BACK, LEADING THE WORLD AGAIN AND GIVE OUR CHILDREN A DIFFERENT LOOK.

WATCH OUR LIVE COVERAGE. ON MONTH FEBRUARY 3, C-SPAN'S 2020. YOUR UNFILTERED VIEW OF POLITICS. IN NEW YORK CITY STOOD, 2020, JOE BIDEN SPOKE ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY, THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DISCUSSED THE AIR STRIKE THAT KILLED GENERAL SOLEIMANI AND THE IMPORTANCE OF REJOINING THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL. PLEASE WELCOME VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: GOOD AFTERNOON, FOLKS. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. SIX MONTHS AGO HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, I MADE THE CASE THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS DANGEROUSLY INCOMPETENT AND INCAPABLE OF WORLD LEADERSHIP AND IN THE PAST FEW DAYS IN THE WAKE OF THE KILLING OF THE IRANIAN GENERAL SOLEIMANI, DONALD TRUMP HAS PROVEN THAT BEYOND. AND THE FAILURE TO CONSULT WITH OUR ALLIES OR CONGRESS AND THE RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD SURELY FOLLOW WAS IN MY VIEW DANGEROUSLY INCOMPETENT. FOLKS, IN THE WAKE OF SUCH AN ENORMOUS ESCALATION THAT HAS EXPLODED TO POLITICS IN THE REGION HAS PUT THE UNITED STATES ON A COLLISION COURSE THAT WHAT WE EXPECT FROM AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. WHAT HAVE WE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP? WE HAVE NOT HEARD AN EXPLANATION TO ASSURE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THIS DECISION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES WERE THOUGHT THROUGH. NO LEVEL-HEADED WORDS MEANT TO DIAL DOWN THE TENSIONS AND TAKE US OFF THE PATH OF CONFLICT. NO PRESS CONFERENCE OR CONSULTATION WITH OUR CONGRESS. NO. WHAT WE HAVE HEARD SO FAR ARE TWEETS, THREATS AND TANTRUMS. ALL WE HEARD FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION ARE SHIFTY EXPLANATIONS, EVASIVE EXPLANATIONS, AND IMMINENT THREAT WITHOUT THE NECESSARY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT CONCLUSION. AND SINCE THIS IS A PRESIDENT WITH A HISTORY OF LYING ABOUT VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING, WHO HAS DESTROYED HIS OWN CREDIBILITY AND THAT OF THE UNITED STATES ON THE GLOBAL STAGE, WE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NOR OUR ALLIES AND INDEED, NO ONE AROUND THE WORLD SEEMS TO BE TAKING HIS WORD FOR IT. IF THERE WAS AN IMMINENT THREAT THAT REQUIRED THIS EXTRAORDINARY ACTION THAT WE ARE ARE OWED AN EXPLANATION AND FACTS TO BACK IT UP. BUT THE , THESE MATTERS ARE IMPORTANT. AND TO ME, THEY ARE UNMISTAKENBLY CLEAR. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GO TO WAR WITH IRAN WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATION. WITHOUT WORKING WITH CONGRESS. IT IS NOT OPTIONAL. IT IS NOT AN OPTIONAL PART OF HIS JOB. PRESIDENTIAL NOTIFICATION TO CONGRESS CANNOT BE SATISFIED IN 280 CHARACTERS OR LESS. AND NO PRESIDENT SHOULD EVER TAKE UNITED STATES TO WAR WITHOUT SECURING THE INFORMED CONSENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE REFUSES TO LEVEL WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THE DANGERS WHICH HE HAS PLACED AMERICAN TROOPS AND OUR DIPLOMATIC CORPS AND CIVILIANS AND PERSONNEL AS WELL, AND OUR PARTNERS AND ALLIES OR SHOWED A MODICUM OF GRAVITAS, I WILL ATTEMPT TO DO THAT. MAKE NO MISTAKE THAT THIS OUTCOME WAS A STRATEGIC SET BACK, CHANTS OF DEATH TO AMERICA, ONCE MORE ECHOING ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. IRAN AND ITS ALLIES ARE VOWING REVENGE THAT WAS AVOIDABLE. THE SEEDS OF DANGER WERE PLANTED BY DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF ON MAY 8, 2018. THE DAY THE PRESIDENT TORE UP THE NUCLEAR DEAL AGAINST HIS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISERS AND TURNED HIS CLOSEST EUROPEAN ALLIES AND HE DESTROYED ANY PROGRESS MADE BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND BUILD ON IT AND CREATE A SAFER WORLD. WHAT WE HAD IN THE IRAN DEAL, WE HAD VERBAL VIABILITY, CUT OFF EVERY ONE OF IRAN'S PATHWAYS TO A NUCLEAR WEAPON. INSPECTORS REPEATEDLY CONFIRMED IRAN'S COMPLIANCE AS WELL AS OUR OWN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. AND ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO GLOBAL SECURITY WAS OFF THE TABLE. IRANIAN NUCLEAR POWER. AND WHEN THE IRANIAN DEAL WAS ENFORCED, WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS DANGEROUS CYCLE OF AT THIS TIME FOR AT THAT TIME RESPONSE. THERE WERE ALLIES AND PARTNERS TO ADDRESS THEIR ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE ACTION. THE IRAN DEAL WAS NOT ONLY ACCOMPLISHING A CRITICAL MISSION THAT IT WAS DESIGNED FOR, BUT CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE DIPLOMACY WAS POSSIBLE. AND TRUMP, HE WALKED AWAY, NOT IRAN, TRUMP WALKED AWAY. TRUMP MADE THE INTERNATIONAL OUTLIAR. TRUMP REIMPO POSSESSED SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS TO QUOTE EXERT MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON THE REGIME WITH CLAIMS THAT IT WOULD DETER AGGRESSION AND SECURE A MUCH PROMISED, QUOTE, BETTER DEAL. . ON BOTH FRONTS, AS MANY ANTICIPATED AT THE TIME, HIS THREATS WERE EMPTY, BASELESS, AND NAIVE. SINCE THEN ALL THAT'S MATERIALIZED IS AN UTTERLY PREDICTABLE CYCLE OF ESCALATING CONFLICT WITH IRAN. IT WAS STATED AT THE TIME THAT OF COURSE IRAN WOULD SEEK TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PRESSURE WE WERE EXERTING WAS NOT COST-FREE. THEY COULD TAKE ACTIONS TO MAKE LIFE MORE DIFFICULT FOR US AS WELL. IRAN BEGAN AGAIN TO UNEARTH AND ENRICH URANIUM BEYOND THE LIMITS ALLOWED UNDER THE IRAN DEAL, THE NUCLEAR DEAL. IRAN ATTACKED OIL TANKERS, SHOT DOWN AN UNMANNED U.S. SURVEILLANCE DRONE. YET THE ADMINISTRATION HAD NO PLAN TO PREVENT, MITIGATE, OR APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO THESE PROVOCATIONS. INSTEAD, TRUMP ACTED ERRATICALLY AND IMPULSIVELY, WHICH IS NOT UNEXPECT. HE ORDERED A RETALIATORY STRIKE THEN CALLED IT OFF AT THE LAST MINUTE, THEN THE ADMINISTRATION IMPOSED MORE SANCTIONS. SHOT DOWN AN IRANIAN DRONE, ISSUED A WARRANT TO SEIZE EWE RAIN , SEIZE AN IRANIAN OIL TANKER AND BEFORE LONG, IRAN ATTACKED SAUDI ARABIA'S FACILITY, AND IRAQ RESTARTED ROCKET ATTACKS AGAINST OUR BASES. UNTIL ONE OF THOSE ATTACKS AGAINST OUR BASES, KIRKUK, KILLED A U.S. CITIZEN AND WOUNDED OTHERS. TAFF TRAGIC LOSS OF LIFE, AN ACT CONDEMNED BY ALL AMERICANS. BUT IN RESPONSE, TRUMP BOMBED FIVE SITES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA, TIED TO THE MILITIA GROUP, KILLING AT LEAST 25. IRAQ PROTESTERS ORGANIZED BY IRAN-BACKED MILITIAS ASSAULTED OUR EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD AND BREACHED THE OUTER WALL OF THAT COMPOUND. NO INJURIES WERE REPORT BUD TRUMP WAS EMBARRASSED. BY THE IMAGES OF A BURNT OUT RECEPTION AREA. HE ORDERED THE DRONE STRIKES TO KILL SOLEIMANI, PERHAPS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT OFFICIAL IN IRAN NEAR THE BAGHDAD AIRPORT AS A CONSEQUENCE AND RUSHED THOUSANDS MORE TROOPS TO THE REGION TO DEAL WITH THE FALLOUT. ACTION-REACTION, PROVOCATION-RESPONSE. ALL PREDICTABLE, ALL PREDICTED. A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS HE WANTS TO CUT, END, AND DEFAULTLESS WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS BRINGING US DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO STARTING A BRAND NEW ONE. A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS HE WANTS OUT OF THE REGION SENDS AN ADDITIONAL 18,000 PLUS TRPS TO DEAL WITH A CRISIS OF OYS HIS OWN MAKING. AN ADMINISTRATION THAT CLAIMS ITS ACTIONS MADE AMERICA SAFER IN THE SAME BREATH URGES OUR CITIZENS TO LEAVE IRAQ, PUTS AMERICANS THROUGHOUT THE REGION ON NOTICE BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED DANGER THAT NOW EXISTS. I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT IRAN, I NEVER HAVE. THE REGIME HAS LONG SPONSORED TERRORISTS WHO THREATENED OUR INTERESTS. IT CON TIN , IT CONTINUES TO DETAIN AMERICAN CITIZENS. RUTHLESSLY KILLED HUNDREDS OF PROTESTERS. THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. BUT THERE'S A SMART WAY TO COUNTER THEM. 20 COUNTER IRAN. AND A SELF-DEFEATING WAY. TRUMP'S APPROACH IN MY VIEW IS DEMONSTRABLY THE LATTER. SOLEIMANI WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN TROOPS AN THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT LIVES THROUGHOUT THE REGION. HE WAS THE MASTERMIND BUT HE WAS NOT THE WHOLE OF THE REGIME OR ITS CAPACITY TO STRIKE BACK. SO THE QUESTION IS, WAS THE REWARD OF REMOVING A BAD ACTOR WORTH THE RISK OF WHAT COMES NEXT? WE DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT TRUMP OR ANYONE AROUND HIM THOUGHT SERIOUSLY ABOUT THAT CALCULUS. THE PENTAGON LONG WARNED AGAINST TAKING A SHOT LIKE THIS WAS SHOCKED THAT TRUMP WOULD TAKE SUCH A TERRIFIC, THAT'S THE REPORTS, I CAN'T VERIFY. IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER IRAN WILL RETALIATE, IT ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL. BUT , BUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR TROOPS, OUR PERSONNEL THROUGHOUT THE REGION, WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS WHO HAVE TROOPS IN HARM'S WAY, THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS DECISION, WHAT IT WILL MEAN FOR THE LONG-TERM MISSION OF COUNTERING IRAN AND PREVENTING ISIS FROM BOUNCING BACK AND OUR MILITARY TO PURSUE A BROADER STRATEGIC AIM IN THE REGION, ALREADY WE'RE SEEING THE FALLOUT. IRAN HAS DECLARED IT WILL NO LONGER ABIDE BY THE CONSTRAINTS SET UP BY THE NUCLEAR DEAL, PUTTING IT BACK ON TRACK TO OBTAIN MATERIAL FOR A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND PUSHING THE REGION CLOSER TO A NUCLEAR CRISIS. YOU KNOW, OUR FORCES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA ARE NOW FOCUSED ON PROTECTING THEMSELVES, PREPARING TO LEAD, PUTTING THE COUNTERISIS MISSION ON HOLD, ALLOWING A DEADLY TERRORIST ORGANIZATION THE ROOM TO REGROUP AND REACTIVATE. THE IRAN PARLIAMENT VOTED TO EJECT ALL AMERICANS AND COALITION FORCES FROM THE COUNTRY. AND HOWEVER YOU MAY FEEL ABOUT AMERICAN MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THERE'S A RIGHT WAY AND A WRONG WAY TO DRAW DOWN OUR TROOPS, OUR TROOP PRESENCE. GETTING UNSER MOANS YOULY KICKED OUT IS UNEQUIVOCALLY THE WRONG WAY. AND IF WE DO END UP HAVING TO LEAVE, THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER BOON FOR IRAN TIPPING THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE REGION IN THEIR FAVOR. JUST WEEKS AGO, THERE WAS SPONTANEOUS PROTEST ACROSS IRAN AGAINST THE REGIME. IT'S TAKEN THAT PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS OFF THE REGIME NOW. TRUMP'S IMPULSIVE DECISION MAY DO MORE TO STRENGTHEN IRAN'S POSITION IN THE RETHAN ANY OF SOLEIMANI'S PLOTS WOULD HAVE EVER ACCOMPLISHED. YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT WE SEE MORE OR LESS LIFE, MORE OR LESS THREATS, MORE INTEREST IN THE AREA, IT'S ALWAYS, IT'S ALWAYS AND NOW A DEBACLE. WHAT WE HAVE , AND WHAT IS POSSIBLY THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME IN RECENT AMERICAN HISTORY AND PRECISELY THE MOMENT WHEN WE SHOULD BE RALLYING OUR ALLIES TO STAND BESIDE US AND HOLD THE LINE AGAINST THREATS, DONALD TRUMP'S SHORTSIGHTED, AMERICA-FIRST DOGMATISM HAS COME HOME TO ROOST. OUR CLOSEST ALLIES, OUR CLOSEST ALLIES ARE CALLING FOR RESTRAINT AND MAKING A MORAL EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN IRAN AND THE UNITED STATES. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THAT HAPPEN COMING OUT OF NATO AND CHINA AND RUSSIA ARE QUIETLY REVELING IN THE PROSPECT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL NOW ONCE AGAIN BE BOGGED DOWN IN ANOTHER MAJOR CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST, GIVING THEM ROOM, THEY'D LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE THEIR OWN INTERESTS, THEIR OWN INTERESTS AND CARVE OUT THEIR OWN SPHERES OF INFLUENCE WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES CHALLENGING THEM ON HUMAN RIGHTS. ON ABUSIVE TRADE PRACTICES. ON MEDDLING IN OTHER NATIONS' DEMOCRACIES. BECAUSE WE'RE TOO BUSY IN IRAN. WE ARE ALONE NOW. WE'RE ALONE AND WE'LL HAVE TO BEAR THE COST OF DONALD TRUMP'S FOLLY. AND THIS , AT THIS MOMENT, IT SEEMS TO ME WHEN WE MOST FEEL THE LACK OF FUNCTION IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY PROCESS OR DIPLOMACY, WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. AFTER THREE YEARS OF HOLLOWING OUT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, DISRESPECTING AND DISMISSING OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, DESTROYING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND CAPITOL HILL, THROWING OUT THE DELIBERATE POLICYMAKING PROCESS THAT HAS SERVED REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS FOR DECADES, CO-ROADING THE VALUES OF THE WORD OF THE UNITED STATES, ABUSING OUR ALLIES, EMBRACING DICTATORS, CREATE, NOT SOLVING FOREIGN POLICY ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE, WE'RE IN A MUCH WORSE POSITION TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THIS CRISIS THAN WE WERE WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I LEFT OFFICE. YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NO STRATEGY, IT SEEMS TO ME. HE HAS NO END GAME. HERE'S THE HARDEST TRUTH OF ALL. HIS CONSTANT MISTAKES AND POOR DECISION MAKE HAVING LEFT US, THE UNITED STATES WORK A SEVERELY LIMITED SLATE OF OPTIONS FOR HOW TO MOVE FORWARD. AND MOST OF THOSE OPTIONS ARE NOW BAD. BUT THERE ARE SOME KEY STEPS IN ANY RESPONSIBLE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WOULD TAKE. WHILE I DON'T EXPECT DONALD TRUMP TO LISTEN TO ME, I HOPE HE'LL LISTEN TO THOSE AROUND HIM WHO UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THE THREATS WE NOW FACE. HE SHOULD TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PROTECT OUR FORCES AND ENSURE THE SECURITY OF OUR DIPLOMATS, CIVILIANS AND OVERSEAS FACILITIES, NOT JUST IN THE MIDDLE EAST BUT ANYWHERE IRAN MIGHT BE ABLE TO STRIKE. HE SHOULD ENSURE THAT AUTHORITIES ARE WORKING WITH STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS TO GUARD AGAINST HEIGHTENED RISK FOR SIGNER , CYBER ATTACKS. HE SHOULD STOP TWEETING SO HE DOESN'T BOX US IN WITH THESE THREATS THAT THE ONLY OPTIONS LEFT FOR IRAN ARE UNCREASINGLY DAMAGING STRIKES AND COUNTERSTRIKES. AND HE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY, I HOPE HE'S DOING THIS NOW BUT I'VE HEARD NONE OF IT, HE SHOULD BE REACHING OUT TO OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS AND OTHERS AND SEND PRIVATE SIGNALS OF DETERRENCE AND DE-ESCALATION TO IREASON AND FIND A WAY TO AVOID THE ONRUSH OF WAR AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO REJOIN THE IRAN DEAL AND BUILD ON IT. IF IRAN MOVES BACK IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE OBLIGATIONS AND RE-ESTABLISHES INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS ABOUT HOW TO CONFRONT THESE THREATS, WE WOULD BE MUCH, MUCH BETTER OFF. THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS CRISIS IS THROUGH DIEMPLOYEE MAY. IS CLEAR-EYED, HARD-NOSED DIPLOMACY GROUNDED IN STRATEGY THAT'S NOT ABOUT ONE-OFF DECISIONS AND ONE UPMANS , ONE UPSMANSHIP. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR REGIONAL INTERESTS INCLUDING OUR COUNTERISIS CAMPAIGN. NO ONE WANTS WAR. BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE HARD WORK TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T END UP THERE BY ACCIDENT. FINALLY, THIS ONE IS NOT OPTIONAL, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN YOUR DECISION AND YOUR STRATEGY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT'S YOUR JOB AS PRESIDENT, MR. PRESIDENT. NOT DEAR LEADER. NOT SUPREME LEADER. DEMOCRACY RUNS ON ACCOUNTABILITY. AND NOWHERE IS IT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE POWER TO MAKE WAR AND BRING PEACE. YOU'RE REQUIRED TO WORK WITH CONGRESS, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU'RE REQUIRED TO ABIDE BY THE WAR POWERS RESOLUTION, MR. PRESIDENT. AND YOU CANNOT PURSUE WAR WITH IRAN WITHOUT CONSENT AND AUTHORITY FROM CONGRESS. THE EXISTING AUMF'S, THE CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATIONS FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE DO, NOT APPLY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT WANT AND OUR CONSTITUTION WILL NOT ABIDE A PRESIDENT WHO RULES BY FIAT AND DEMANDS OBEDIENCE. I SERVED IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH FOR EIGHT YEARS. EIGHT YEARS. AND YOU KNOW, WHAT I FIND IS I SERVED IN THAT BRANCH, ALSO, THE OTHER ONE, THE STHATH, THE CONGRESS, FOR 36. AND I UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN ANYONE THAT THE SYSTEM WILL NOT HOLD UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADVANCE OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS. TO WORK TOGETHER. NOT IN A POLITICAL INTEREST OF ANY ONE PARTY OR ANY ONE PERSON. WE NEED TO RESTORE THE BALANCE OF POWERS BETWEEN THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. WE NEED TO , WE NEED CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT SERVE TO CHECK AND BALANCE THE WORST INSTINCTS OF OUR LEADERS IN EITHER OF THE BRANCHES. WE NEED TO USE OUR SYSTEM TO BRING US TOGETHER AS A NATION, NOT ABUSE IT AND RIP US APART. THIS IS NOT A NAIVE, OUTDATED WAY OF THINKING. THIS IS THE GENIUS AND TIMELESSNESS OF OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM WHICH HAS FOR MORE THAN 240 YEARS ALLOWED US TO REMAKE OUR , OURSELVES, RECKON WITH OUR SHORTCOMINGS AND MOVE OUR NATION EVER FORWARD. THAT'S WHAT WE OWE THESE BRAVE WOMEN AND MEN WHO STEPPED FORWARD TO WEAR THE UNIFORM OF THE UNITED STATES. WHO DECIDE, WHO DEDICATED THEIR LIFE TO DIPLOMATIC SERVICE. WHO CHOSE THAT JOIN THE PEACE CORPS OR WORK IN DEVELOPMENT. WE REPRESENT THE BEST OF OUR COUNTRY THEY REPRESENT THE BEST OF OUR COUNTRY ALL AROUND THE WORLD. TODAY THEY ARE DOING SO AT GREAT RISK BECAUSE OF OUR PRESIDENT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. THESE ARE DANGEROUS TIMES, BUT LET ME END BY SAYING, MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. WE NEED ACTION, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?467903-1\/vice-president-joe-biden-foreign-policy-statement","Summary":"Former Vice President and 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden delivered remarks on foreign policy at Chelsea Piers in New York City.

IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR COMING OUT. THANK YOU TO BETHANY AND MR. SPEAKER FOR NOT ONLY YOUR SERVICES AS A SPEAKER BUT YOUR SERVICE IN VIETNAM. YOU KNOW BEAU. HE SAID THE MOST MOVING THING THAT HAPPENED AFTER HE CAME HOME , HELLO? HELLO? I WILL PULL THIS ONE OFF. OH, YES. EXCUSE MY BACK, I APOLOGIZE. HE SAID ONE OF THE MOST MOVING THINGS OCCURRED AFTER HE HAD BEEN A YEAR AND A RACK. THEY LANDED, HIS DIVISION. HIS UNIT. AND HE SAID , I FORGET THE EXACT NUMBER BUT SOMETHING LIKE 30 VIETNAM THAT'S STANDING THERE IN LINE AS THEY GOT OFF AND SALUTING THEM. AND WHEN YOU GUYS CAME HOME, THAT DID NOT HAPPEN AND YOU DESERVE EVERY BIT OF RESPECT THAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS.

TALK ABOUT HEAVEN ON EARTH. FOLKS, LOOK, I WILL BE BRIEF BECAUSE I WANT A CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU ALL AS WE GO AROUND THIS ROPE LINE. BUT, FOLKS, YOU ALL DO HAVE A BIG RESPONSIBILITY. THERE IS A LOT OF STATES AND BOTH PRIMARIES THAT ANDY YOU BEING THE FIRST PRIMARY BUT TO ALWAYS TAKE IT REALLY SERIOUSLY. DECIDING ON NOT ONLY WHO IS BEST FOR YOUR STATE BUT WHETHER THAT PERSON CAN GO ON AND WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION. AND I HAVE BEEN SAYING SINCE I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS RACE, THE CARE OR OF THIS COUNTRY IS ON THE BALLOT. THE CANDIDATES , THE CHARACTER OF THE CANDIDATES AND THE CHARACTER OF OUR LEADERS. AND DONALD TRUMP, AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN EXAGGERATION TO SUGGEST, HE HAS DIMINISHED THE CHARACTER OF THE U.S. ALLIES ONCE LOOKED AT US FOR LEADERSHIP AND OUR MORAL LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS OUR PHYSICAL LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD AND THEY ARE NOW TALKING ABOUT MOVING ON WITHOUT US. OUR ADVERSARIES WHO ONCE FEARED TO CROSS US NOW SEE A PRESIDENT THAT ONE CAN BAMBOOZLE OR IGNORED. ORDINARY PEOPLE IN EVERY NATION AROUND THE WORLD WHO ONCE SAW AMERICA AS A CITADEL OF MORAL LIBERTY AND THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT THE ORDINARY PEOPLE LOOK AND SAY , WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE? WE USED TO STAND FOR UNIVERSAL RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, FREEDOM OF ALL PEOPLE AND NOW WE SEE THE PRESIDENT REFERRED TO GETTING LOVE LETTERS FROM THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER. BACKSLAPPING OTHER AUTOCRATIC LEADERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD WHILE POKING HIS FINGER AT OUR ALLIES AND FRIENDS. WE ONCE WERE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND OPEN AND WELCOME TO ALL. DONALD TRUMP HAS TRIED TO CLOSE THE GATES. MY WIFE WAS RECENTLY IN BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS WITH A CONGRESSMAN FROM TEXAS TO PROVIDE CHRISTMAS MEALS FOR THESE KIDS, MOSTLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN LIVING IN SQUALOR SEEKING ASYLUM. FIRST TIME I AM AWARE OF ANY PRESIDENT REQUIRING AN ASYLUM SEEKER TO NOT SEEK IT FROM U.S. SOIL BUT DOES HE GET FROM ABROAD, IN THIS CASE IN LITERALLY IN RAINSOAKED BANKS ALONG THE RIVER'S IN MEXICO. AND REFUGEES AND ENTIRE RELIGIOUS GROUPS , THE SO-CALLED MUSLIM BAN. ABN IS A BETRAYAL OF ALL FOUNDATIONS OF OUR AMERICAN HISTORY AND AMERICAN FREEDOM. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE STAND FOR AND NOW AFTER A THREE-YEAR ASSAULT ON OUR AMERICAN VALUES, DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE WANTS TO EXPAND THE RELIGIOUS BAND TO MORE COUNTRIES. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS ANTI-MUSLIM BIAS IS NOT ONLY MORALLY WRONG, IT IS LIKE PUTTING UP A GREAT BIG RECRUITING BANNER FOR TERRORISTS SAYING , SEE, WE TOLD YOU. THEY WANT TO ABANDON US. THE FACT HE DOES NOT SEE THAT , I'M CONFIDENT THE PEOPLE ADVISING HIM KNOW IT BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM TO LISTEN TO ANYONE OF CONSEQUENCE. MAKE NO MISTAKE , IT COMES OUT OF , HOW CAN I SAY IT? YOU SAW THE REPORT THAT INDIRECTLY REFERENCED LAST WEEK, IT HAPPENED A WHILE AGO, WHERE THERE WAS A SUPER SECRET PLACE FOR MEETINGS. HE REFERRED TO THESE INCREDIBLE GENERALS AND FLAG OFFICERS MANY HOME HAVE LEFT THEM PUBLICLY CRITICIZED HIM , HE REFERRED TO THEM AS LOSERS, DOPES, AND BABIES TO THEIR FACE. IN FRONT OF THEIR FOLKS. AND THEN THIS WEEK, HE BRUSHED OFF THOSE BRAVE TROOPS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOMBARDMENT. HE SAID THAT WHILE THEY ARE BEING EVALUATED FOR TRAUMATIC RAIN INJURY, HE SAID NO, THEY JUST HAVE A HEADACHE. MY WORDS NOT HIS , WHY DON'T YOU JUST GROW WHAT? AND I APOLOGIZE TO THE PRESS THAT FOLLOWS ME. I BRING OUT MY SCHEDULE AND AT THE BOTTOM I HAVE , TROOPS KILLED. I WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY FALLEN HEROES HAVE DIED. IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, SO FAR 6904. A WEEK AGO, IT WAS 6901. EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY ONE LEFT BEHIND A FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITY. AN ENTIRE GROUP OF PEOPLE. WHAT IS NOT ON HERE IS THAT THERE ARE 300,000, 300 THOUSAND ESTIMATED PEOPLE COMING HOME FROM THESE WARS WITH , SUFFERING FROM POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF BEING EXPOSED TO TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES AND OTHER PROBLEMS. THE IDEA THAT IT IS TAKEN SO LIGHTLY, I FIND IT QUITE FRANKLY DISGUSTING. AND LAST YEAR, A GALLUP POLL RELEASED A STUDY THAT SAID THE WORLD NOW RATES CHINA, CHINA'S LEADERSHIP HIGHER THAN THEY DO AMERICA'S MISSION IN THE WORLD. AS MY WIFE AND PROFESSOR WITH SAY , YOU CAN GOOGLE IT AND WE ARE JUST ABOVE, BARELY ABOVE RUSSIA. YOU KNOW, OUR MORAL AUTHORITY HAS BEEN SACKED. OUR CREDIBILITY HAS BEEN SHOT. AND QUITE FRANKLY, OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD HAS BEEN DIMINISHED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL INHERIT TWO THINGS, ESPECIALLY AFTER THIS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL NO MATTER HOW IT GOES. ONE, THEY WILL INHERIT A DIVIDED COUNTRY AND NUMBER TWO, A WORLD IN DISARRAY. OR WILL BE NO TIME FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. NOT. WE WILL NEED A PRESIDENT READY ON DAY ONE TO COMMAND THE WORLD STAGE, IT BE THE COMMANDER OF THE FORCES AND MAKE THE U.S. THE PHYSICAL AND MORAL LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO IT FROM THE BEGINNING. WE NEED A PRESIDENT THAT KNOWS THAT THIS COUNTRY WAS NOT BUILT BY WALL STREET BANKERS OR CEOS. IT WAS BUILT BY THE MIDDLE CLASS , ORDINARY HARD-WORKING PEOPLE LIKE MY FAMILY AND YOUR'S. ORDINARY AMERICANS THAT DID EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WHEN GIVEN HALF A CHANCE. JUST A CHANCE. NO GUARANTEES. I HARD-WORKING MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS THIS NATION. ON FACTORY FLOORS AND UNDERSTANDING THE DIGNITY OF LABOR. AND A PRESIDENT THAT KNOWS IT WAS BUILT , THE MIDDLE CLASS WAS BUILT BY UNIONS. UNIONS. YOU CAN SEE THE PLAN. YOU CAN SEE THE PLAN THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT IN PLACE BUT YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE PAIN THAT IS STILL RESONATE IN MANY COMMUNITIES LIKE OURS. PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY THINK THE ECONOMY IS DOING GREAT FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. HE EITHER DOES NOT KNOW OR DOES NOT CARE THAT WORKING MEN AND WOMEN ARE STILL GETTING THE SHORT END OF THE STICK. RECENT STUDY SHOWED 44% OF THE PEOPLE ARE MAKING APPROXIMATELY THE EQUIVALENT OF NINE DOLLARS AND OUR. 44% OF THE PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU GOT BENEFITS FROM THE TAX CUT , LOOK, WE NEED A PRESIDENT THAT CAN BRING US TOGETHER, UNITE OUR PARTY AND THE COUNTRY AS WELL. WE ARE A DEMOCRACY. AND A DEMOCRACY IS A STATE BECAUSE IT DEPENDS UPON CONSENSUS. YOU CANNOT GET ANYTHING DONE UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION UNLESS YOU CAN REACH A CONSENSUS. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN MAKE THE PROGRESS WE NEED TO MAKE. IF YOU CANNOT UNITE THE COUNTRY, NOT ON EVERY SINGLE THING BUT IN A WAY THAT WE CAN GENERATE THE SUPPORT NEEDED TO FORM A CONSENSUS, WE ARE IN REAL TROUBLE. I KNOW MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES, AND THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE SEEKING THE NOMINATION AS WELL, THINK I AM NAIVE. AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT WE CAN IN FACT GENERATE SOME KIND OF CONSENSUS BETWEEN DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS. BUT I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION THAT IN FACT THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE. AND THIS ENDLESS WAR BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. IT IS DEADLY FOR US. I HAVE SPENT MY WHOLE CAREER IN THE SENATE AND AS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. WORKING TOGETHER TO GET MAJOR THINGS DONE AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET THEM DONE. AND WHEN YOU CANNOT AGREE WITH REPUBLICANS, YOU GO OUT AND CAMPAIGN AGAINST THEM AND DEFEAT THEM. YOU TALK ABOUT THE MARRIAGE. IT IS OK TO JUDGE THEIR JUDGMENT BUT NOT TO QUESTION THEIR MOTIVE. BUT US WORK OUT AN AGREEMENT ON INFRASTRUCTURE. ON CLIMATE CHANGE. THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF DOING THAT. BUT THAT IS THE WAY WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER NATIONALLY NOW AND IT HAS TO STOP BECAUSE WE CANNOT GET AN AWFUL LOT DONE. I'M TOLD BY MY COLLEAGUES SEEKING A NOMINATION THAT BIDEN HAS DONE THIS HIS WHOLE LIFE BUT HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THIS NEW PARTY. I HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT OF AFFECTION OF THIS NEW PARTY FOR A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME NOW AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT REPEATEDLY. DONALD TRUMP HAS SPENT WELL OVER 12 MILLION , $12 MILLION-$14 MILLION TELLING LIES ABOUT ME. THIS DEMOCRAT PARTY UNDERSTANDS BETTER THAN MOST. THEY HAVE SMEARED ME. HE HAS COLLUDED WITH FOREIGN POWERS TO MAKE SURE , HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A PRESIDENT SPENT SO MUCH TIME TRYING TO KEEP SOMEONE FOR BEING A NOMINEE? I WONDER WHY? YOU SAW IT TODAY THAT HIS SPOKESPERSON SAID , YOU SHOULD NOMINATE SOMEONE ELSE OTHER THAN BIDEN BECAUSE BIDEN IS A BAD GUY. WELL, KELLYANNE CONWAY, I APPRECIATE HER BEING AGAINST ME. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, THEY HAVE SLANDERED ME AND MY ONLY SURVIVING SON. BUT LOOK, I CANNOT HOLD GRUDGES. I MEAN THAT SINCERELY. MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS WITH ME TONIGHT, TODAY AND SHE IS CAMPAIGNING WITH ME AND HER NAME IS FINNEGAN BIDEN. SHE IS A JUNIOR IN COLLEGE IN PHILADELPHIA AND SHE IS ON THE TRAIL WITH ME AND SHE AND , I HAVE TAUGHT ALL MY KIDS AND MY FIVE RAN KIDS THAT A PRESIDENT HAS TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT THE PRESIDENT CANNOT HOLD GRUDGES. A PRESIDENT HAS TO HEAL. THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME OR MY FAMILY, THIS IS ABOUT YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOT ABOUT ME. AND I REALLY MEAN THAT. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE. MY CHILDREN'S FUTURE AND YOUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE. AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED MORE THAN JUST PLANS AND PROPOSALS. WE NEED SOMEONE THAT CAN ACTUALLY GET SOME OF IT DONE. SOME OF IT PASSED. I WILL PUT MY RECORD ON THE LINE WITH ALL OF THE NOMINEES RUNNING AS MY RECORD OF DELIVERING BIG THINGS, CONSEQUENTIAL DEMOCRATIC WINS UP AND DOWN THE LINE AND AGAINST ANYONE IN THIS RACE. I WAS A GUY THAT WORKED LIKE THE DEVIL AND GOT THE BRADY BILL PASSED AND BACKGROUND CHECKS. I PASSED THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN WHICH LASTED FOR 10 YEARS AND A BAND FOR HIGH-CAPACITY , [APPLAUSE] HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES. YOU COULD NOT HAVE 100 OR 50 BULLETS IN A CLIP. WHO IN GODS NAME NEEDS THAT OTHER THAN TO DO DAMAGE? I PASSED THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN'S ACT. [APPLAUSE] I GOT THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS BAN THROUGH THE U.S. SENATE. AND I DELIVERED THREE REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR THE RECOVERY ACT WHICH WAS A BILL THAT KEPT US OUT OF A DEPRESSION. WORKING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT, WE WERE ABLE TO GET OBAMACARE. PROTECTING 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. BY THE WAY, I FOUND IT FASCINATING , DID YOU HEAR LAST WEEK? PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID , I AM THE REASON WHY PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ARE COVERED. AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY , BLESS ME, FATHER, I HAVE SINNED. WHAT IS GOING ON? NOW, YESTERDAY HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT , TWO DAYS AGO, HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT CUTTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE AND NOW HE IS GOING TO BE SAVED. I JUST MIGHT YOU TO KNOW THAT IT WILL ALL BE SAVED BY HIM. I SHOULD NOT EVEN GET GOING. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO NEED IS WE CAN GET THINGS DONE. I HAVE PUT , MY TEAM WAS PART OF SECURING THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. KEEPING IRAN FROM FINDING A PATH TO A NUCLEAR WEAPON WITHOUT NOTICE. NOT A SINGLE PERSON SAID THAT THEY HAD VIOLATED IT. AND NUMBER TWO, THE PARIS AGREEMENT. THE BEST HOPE FOR THE WORLD TO MEET THE CLIMATE ROLE. , CLIMATE GOAL. PEOPLE SAY WE CAN'T LET THINGS DONE. ON OUR WAY OUT OF OFFICE, AFTER THE GENERAL ELECTION, WE WERE TOLD THAT NOT A SINGLE THING WHAT PAST THE TWEEN THE TIME HE WON AND THE TIME HE WAS SWORN IN. I PUT TOGETHER A BIPARTISAN DEAL WORTH ALMOST $9 BILLION FOR CANCER RESEARCH. EVEN THE REPUBLICANS WERE KIND ENOUGH TO NAME IT THE BEAU BIDEN CANCER RECOVERY ACT AS WELL AS $7 BILLION FOR CANCER RESEARCH AND OTHER RESEARCH. AND A BIPARTISAN INVESTMENT CALLED THE CURES ACT. AND WE WERE TOLD WE COULD NOT GET ANYTHING DONE. THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP SAID NOTHING COULD GET THEM. WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE, SOMETIMES SMART THINGS HAPPEN. FOLKS, LOOK , I AM NOT IN NOSTALGIA OR GOING DOWN MEMORY LANE. IT TAKES LEADERSHIP AND WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN LEAD RIGHT NOW. SO, FOLKS, I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO NUMBER ONE RESTORE AND FULLY EXPAND THE PROMISE OF AMERICA , TO LITERALLY RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. AND THIS TIME BRING ALONG BLACK AND BROWN AMERICANS AS WELL AND REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS SO THAT EVERYONE THAT COMES ALONG REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE, GENDER, DISABILITY. AND UNITE THIS COUNTRY SO WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AGAIN AND GET THINGS DONE. IMAGINE ALL OF THE PROGRESS WE CAN MAKE IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS IF WE ALL COME TOGETHER. WE CAN TAKE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND MAKE SURE HEALTH CARE IS NOT A PRIVILEGE BUT AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT AND EVERYONE IS PROTECTED AND CAN AFFORD IT. PREPARE EVERY STUDENT IN AMERICA FROM PRE-K, THREE , THREE YEARS OLD, FOUR YEARS OLD, AND FIVE YEARS OLD AND EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THEIR CHANCES TO SUCCEED ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND TALK ABOUT MORAL DEPRAVITY. 15 YEARS AGO, IF YOU HAD A CHILD GO TO SCHOOL THEY LEARNED HOW TO DROP, ROLE, AND COVER. NOW, THEY LEARN HOW TO DR. AND COVERED. , DUCK AND COVER. THE GREATEST CONCERN OF CHILDREN BETWEEN SEVEN AND 17 IS BEING SHOT IN SCHOOL. THAT IS ASTOUNDING. THAT IS THE FACT. THEIR GREATEST FEAR. FOLKS, LOOK, WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, AMERCO WILL ONCE AGAIN STAND UP TO GET TATERS. WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH OUR ALLIES RATHER THAN BERATING THEM AND BELITTLING THEM. WE WILL RALLY THE FREE WORLD AND MEET THE CHALLENGES OF OUR COUNTRY. WE CAN DO ALL OF THAT AND SO MUCH MORE. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC IN MY WHOLE CAREER. I WAS ELECTED WHEN I WAS A 29 EUROS KID AND THEY CALLED ME THE YOUNG IDEALIST. I AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES TO LEAD IN THE 21ST CENTURY, MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING THAT WE HAVE NEVER , THAT WE HAVE FAILED TO DO IN WAR AND PEACE WHEN WE HAVE SET OUR MIND TO GET IT DONE AS A PEOPLE. FOLKS, THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO IS BEAT DONALD TRUMP. AND NOT ONLY THAT, AS WAS POINTED OUT EARLIER, WE HAVE TO WIN IN STATES THAT WILL WIN US BACK THE U.S. SENATE. BECAUSE FOLKS, WE CAN DO THAT. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WIN. WE HAVE TO BE A WILL TO WIN IN NORTH CAROLINA, WIN IN GEORGIA, IN ARIZONA. NOT JUST MY HOME STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA AND OTHERS. WE WILL WIN THOSE. YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHO CAN BEST HELP, WHO DO THEY MOST WANT TO RUN WITH? WHO WILL HELP THEM FROM THE TOP OF THE TICKET? THAT IS FOR YOU TO DECIDE. I THINK I AND THAT GUY. IT IS UP TO YOU TO DECIDE. WE HAVE TO WIN BACK THE PRESIDENCY AND THE U.S. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP THE MAJORITY OF THE HOUSE THAT WE HAVE NOW. I WENT INTO 24 STATES AND CAMPAIGNED FOR 67 CANDIDATES AND ELECTED 41 PEOPLE TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN GO AFTER THE REPUBLICANS ON THEIR CHARACTER , WE DID NOT GO AFTER THE REPUBLICANS ON THEIR CARE TO HER BUT AFTER HEALTH CARE. THEY ALL WANTED TO DO AWAY WITH OBAMACARE. AND PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE CAMPAIGNED ON THE ISSUE AND WE WON AND PURPLE AND RED STATES. WE WON IN ALABAMA AND ELSEWHERE ACROSS AMERICA. WE CAN DO THIS IF WE REMEMBER WHO THE DEVIL WE ARE. AND WE STAND TOGETHER. LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING TITO , I REALLY HOPE , AND WHERE I COME FROM IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE YOUR STATE. WHAT I HAVE LEARNED HERE IN THE YEARS COMING UP AND CAMPAIGNING FOR PEOPLE AND FOR MYSELF IS YOU ARE LIKE DELAWARE, EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYBODY ELSE WHETHER YOU ARE IN THE NORTH COUNTRY OR DOWN BY THE MASSACHUSETTS BORDER. EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYONE ELSE. THE FIRST TIME I RAN IN DELAWARE WHICH IS THE LARGER STATE. WE HAVE THE LARGEST STATE IN AMERICA WITH ONLY ONE CONGRESSPERSON. WE ARE JUST SHORT OF GETTING TO TWO. AND THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS EVEN MORE DIFFERENT THAN THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH ARE HERE IN TERMS OF HOW TO CAMPAIGN. WHAT HAPPENED WAS I STARTED OFF AND THEY SAID , BE CAREFUL, NOW. I WAS A YOUNG KID. EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYBODY. I STARTED OFF CAMPAIGNING ALONG THE BORDER OF MARYLAND AND DELAWARE IN THE SOUTH. I WAS INVITED INTO A METHODIST CHURCH THAT WAS DOWN IN A SMALL TOWN CALLED SHELBYVILLE. THE PREACHER CAME IN AND HE WAS VERY NICE AND HE SAID I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE COUNCILMEMBER BIDEN TO COME AND MEET SOME OF THE PARISHIONERS. I WAS DOWN THERE WITH A FELLA NAMED EDGAR C BENNETT AND I HAD TO CALL HIM \"EDGAR C.\" AND WE SPEAK WITH AN ACCENT DOWN THERE AND THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY. I WAS GREETING ALL OF THE PEOPLE AND AS WE ARE WALKING OUTCOME HE WAS UNDER THE OAK TREE WITH HIS WIFE. AND WATCHING. WHEN IT IS FINISHED, I ASKED HOW IT WENT , AND HE SAID IT WENT GREAT EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE JERK. AND HE SAID, IT DID GO WELL BUT THAT ONE GUY WAS MY FIRST COUSIN ALEX. THE WAY I CAMPAIGN IS YOU SHOW UP, KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND SHE CAN. MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN. I AM A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR THE U.S. PRESIDENCY. GIVE ME A LOOK. OK? THANK YOU, ALL VERY VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) ALL ACROSS THE FIELD, WE WILL CONNECT THE MISSIONS AND ELIMINATE MORE THAN 40% IN THE FIRST 10 YEARS. [INDISCERNIBLE] FOSSIL FU ELS. IF WE CAN KEEP THE STANDARDS THAT BARACK AND I PUT IN PLACE , FOR EXAMPLE. SHIFT THE FEDERAL PLAN FOR ETHANOL AND BIOFUEL. WE NEED TO REJOIN THE PARIS ACCORD. WE NEED TO UP THE ANTE. WITHOUT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP , HEY MAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. I HAVE TWO 20 SOMETHING YEAR OLD. THERE IS HUGE ANXIETY IN THAT GENERATION AND COMING UP BEHIND THEM ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PLANET THEY WILL BE INHERITING TO LIVE ON. TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE WONDERING IF THEY SHOULD HAVE FAMILIES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THEIR PREVIEW , IT IS ALREADY HERE. I GUESS WHAT I'M HOPING FOR IS MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT WHERE THE PHASEOUT , WHEN THE PHASEOUT OF FOSSIL FUELS WILL BE. THE SCIENCE IS TELLING US A CHIPPY YESTERDAY. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SCIENTIST THAT WILL TELL US THAT WE CANNOT ELIMINATE DOWN TO ZERO BUT WE CAN RADICALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FOSSIL FEELS , FOR EXAMPLE, I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. THE RAIN FOREST IS THE LARGEST CARBON SYSTEM IN THE WHOLE WORLD. ITWHAT ARE WE DOING? WHAT IS THE U.S. DOING? I WOULD PUT THE ENTIRE HEMISPHERE TOGETHER LIKE I DID WITH REGARD TO , THAT IS WHY , I'M THE GUY IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION THAT LED THE EFFORT WITH $100 BILLION BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF SOLAR AND WIND. [INDISCERNIBLE] THAT IS OK. I APPRECIATE THEM. ANYWAYS, TAKE A LOOK. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? GOOD TO SEE YOU. THE U.S. IS COMING BACK. NOTWITHSTANDING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEPS ANGERING EUROPE AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. NATO IS GOING THROUGH A DIFFICULT TIME RIGHT NOW. WE WON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF [INDISCERNIBLE] LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR COUNTRY. 100,000 JOBS OUT THERE THAT PAY WELL. HIGH-TECH JOBS. FOR EXAMPLE, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUN A MACHINE ON THE FLOOR , SOLAR PANELS. THAT IS WHY WE PUT UP WHAT WE DID FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THERE IS A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. HOW WILL WE GET TRADE SCHOOLS AS WELL AS [INDISCERNIBLE] ONE OF THE MOST ENGAGED GUYS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [INDISCERNIBLE] YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE HANGUPS THAT PREVIOUS GENERATIONS DID REGARDING RACE. I REALLY MEAN IT. [INDISCERNIBLE] (music) I KNOW. WELL, THANK YOU, MAN. WE HAVE A DEAL. I HAVE A COMMAND COIN. AND THE NEXT TIME HE SEES ME, IF HE DOES NOT HAVE IT, HE HAS TO BUY THE DRINKS. I GOT COCA-COLA.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?468360-1\/joe-biden-campaign-event-claremont-hampshire","Summary":"Former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, spoke at the Common Man Inn hotel in Claremont, New Hampshire.

MY NAME IS OWEN TOWNS AND. I AM OWEN TOWNS, AND IT IS BEEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME TO BE A HEALING FOR JOE BIDEN. MY FIRST POLITICAL MEMORY GOING UP WAS GOING TO THE VOTING BASE WITH MY FATHER WHO WATCH HIM BEFORE THE OBAMA BIDEN BALLOT IN 2008 AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE WE ACTUALLY VOTED FOR DEMOCRAT AND FOR MANY MILLIONS OF OTHERS OF AMERICANS, THE OBAMA BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WAS PERSONAL. GROWING UP IN RURAL AMERICA ON A FARM, I'VE ALWAYS LEANED TOWARDS CANDIDATES AND POLITICIANS WE TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT MATTER TO MY FAMILY AND THE PEOPLE WHO I GREW UP WITH, MY NEIGHBORS. FOR GENERATIONS, MANY RURAL AMERICANS TENDED TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT, BUT IN 2016 WE SAW THOSE SAME VOTERS VOTE FOR OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND THAT IS SIMPLY PUT BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP SHOWED UP IN AREAS THAT BOTH SIDES WROTE OFF THE MAP. FORTUNATELY THERE IS A CANDIDATE IN OUR PARTY NOW RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES LIKE MY OWN. JOE BIDEN IS THE CANDIDATE TO UNITE OUR COUNTRY AGAIN AND BUILD A DIVERSE SUSTAINABLE WORKING CLASS COALITION THAT WILL HELP US WIN BACK THE MIDWEST. HE HAS SHOWED UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN, LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITIES I GREW UP IN, TO LEARN FROM THEM AND TO HELP THEM. FROM LA TO HERE IN COUNCIL BLUFFS AND BACK HOME IS GRANTED, JOE BIDEN WILL BRING TOGETHER THOSE COMMUNITIES TOGETHER WITH THOSE DISENFRANCHISED VOTERS AND NOT JUST TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE BUT TAKE BACK THE SENATE, I PASSED THE BOLD, PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATION THAT WILL REVITALIZE THE MIDDLE CLASS AND RESTORE THE SOUL OF OUR NATION AND THAT IS WHY I NEED EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN, HALL WITH ONLY FIVE DAYS, OR REALLY, FOUR DAYS UNTIL THE IOWA CAUCUS, I NEED EVERYONE IN THIS CROWD TO LOOK AROUND FOR ONE OF MY COWORKERS WITH A CLIPBOARD AND SIGN UP FOR SOME SHIFTS TO HELP US KNOCK ON DOORS AND MAKE PHONE CALLS AND HELP US OUT ON CAUCUS NIGHT AS A PRECINCT MEMBER.

I AM A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR IOWA SENATE HERE IN DISTRICT EIGHT, WHICH ENCOMPASSES COUNCIL BLUFFS. I WAS REALLY HONORED WHEN THEY ASKED ME TO INTRODUCE OUR GUEST TONIGHT. I WILL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF. 29 YEARS AGO, I TOOK A JOB TO PROTECT THE LIVES AND PROPERTIES OF THIS COMMUNITY AND IT'S A GREAT HONOR AND IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO INTRODUCE A MAN WHO HAS SUCH A WEALTH OF LEGISLATION AND EXPERIENCE AND SO I'M GOING TO TRY AND PUT THIS IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES, BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T COME HERE TO LISTEN TO ME. YOU CAME HERE TO TALK TO JOE. BECAUSE 29 YEARS AGO BECAME A FIREFIGHTER, AND I DID NOT REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO ME TO BE ABLE TO GET UP IN THE MORNING AND GO TO WORK AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY FAMILY AT HOME. JOE BIDEN , AND THIS IS WHY I AM CAUCUSING FOR JOE BIDEN, AND I WILL STAND WITH JOE BIDEN IN A MATTER WHAT. JOE BIDEN MADE IT POSSIBLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY FAMILY IF I BUT THE ULTIMATE PRIZE IN MY JOB. HE SOUGHT TO WHAT THAT FAMILIES OF THOSE THAT LOST THEIR LIVES IN MY LINE OF WORK, THAT THEIR FAMILIES WERE TAKING CARE OF, AND THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. FAMILY IS NUMBER ONE IN LIFE. IT NEVER ONE THING MY SECOND FAMILY IS MY FIREFIGHTERS BROTHERS AND SISTERS. THESE GUYS HAVE MY BACK AT ALL TIMES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT ON A LOT OF, DAYS WE ARE CALLED INTO SOME, VERY VERY BAD SITUATIONS.

THERE IS TWO GUYS OUTSIDE WATCHING OUR BACK, MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T GET LOST IN THERE AND IF WE GET IN TROUBLE, THEY'RE COMING IN TO GET US AND YOU, AND THEN THERE IS JOE BIDEN. IN THE 29 YEARS THAT I WORKED AS A FIREFIGHTER, WE DID NOT HAVE TO ASK HIM FOR HELP, HE WAS THERE. HE WAS LEGISLATING TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS GETTING MY FAIR PAY AND MY FAMILY WAS TAKEN CARE OF. HE IS MAKING SURE THAT THE INJURIES THAT I SUSTAIN, AND AS A FIREFIGHTER I'VE BEEN INTRODUCING SEVERAL TIMES, THAT I WAS TAKEN CARE OF AND MY FAMILY WAS TAKEN CARE OF. JOE BIDEN HAS , FIREFIGHTERS ARE PEOPLE PEOPLE. WE LOVE PEOPLE. WE DO THINGS FOR PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULDN'T IMAGINE. WE TAKE CARE OF YOU. JOE BIDEN IS THIS MAN. HE IS KIND. HE IS THERE.

SYRACUSE GETS MORE SNOW THAN ANY MAJOR CITY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HUNDRED 96 INCHES OF SNOW, AND IT'S COLD. THE PREVIOUS DAYS IT'S NOT COLDER WHEN THE SNOW IS COMING DOWN. I TELL YOU WHAT, I WENT TO SYRACUSE TO PREPARE ME FOR BEING ABLE TO CAMPAIGN IN IOWA. SO GREAT TO SEE. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. AND LET ME THANK THE SOON SENATOR TO BE THESE GUYS HAVE HEARD ME SAY. THIS, THIS IS THE HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION AND A GOOD, GOOD FRIEND OF MINE AND A GREAT HELPED ME MY WHOLE CAREER WE'VE BEEN FRIEND, BUT THERE'S AN EXPRESSION, GOD MADE MAN AND THEN HE MADE A FEW FIREFIGHTERS AND THEY'RE ALL CRAZY, UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE WHO IN GOD'S NAME WOULD RUN INTO A FIRE AND NOT RUN AWAY FROM IT, BUT THEY'RE AMAZING. AND THE TOP WHAT HAVE YOU HAD THIS BOX AND THEY HAVE YOU BACK TO, ANOTHER SAY IN THE SENATE,, EXCUSE APPOINT A PERSONAL PRIVILEGE, THEY HAVE ARE BACK IN THE WAY THAT INCLUDES MY POLITICAL SUPPORT. I'VE ALWAYS HAD THE SUPPORT OF FIREFIGHTERS BACK MY HOME STATE. THERE ARE THREE POLITICAL PARTIES, DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND FIREFIGHTERS. I HAVE THE FIREFIGHTERS BUT SERIOUSLY, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS WORTH SAYING WE, NEVER APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THAT WE ARE IN DIRE NEED OF HELP, WEATHERS ALONG ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, A FIREFIGHTER, A DOCTOR, ENTERS BUT THE THING ABOUT THESE GUYS AND WOMEN IS THEY ARE ALWAYS THERE AND IN MY CASE, THEY SAY THE LIVES OF BOTH MY SONS, I GET ELECTED THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN 1972 AND I WAS DOWN IN WASHINGTON ON DECEMBER 18TH, HOW YOU DOING? ON DECEMBER 18TH, AND I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A FIRST RESPONDER, THE POOR WOMAN WAS SCARED TO DEATH. SHE SAID,, SHE BLURTED, OUT YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER ENDED , ARE DEAD AND YOUR TWO SONS MAY NOT MAKE IT. THESE GUYS, MY FIREFIGHTERS AT HOME, SPENT THREE HOURS WITH THE JAWS OF LIFE GETTING MY SONS UP TO SAVE THEIR LIVES. THREE HOURS AND THEN ABOUT 25 YEAR LONGER THAN THAT AGO, I HAD A CRANIAL ANEURYSM AND I HAD TO GET DOWN TO A HOSPITAL, TO A NEUROSURGEON FOR WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A 13-HOUR OPERATION THE SNOWSTORM. MY FIREFIGHTERS GOT ME DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT SNOW STORM IN TIME TO SAVE MY LIFE THEN I WAS BACK IN 97 I, THINK IT WAS 98 I, WAS DOWN IN WASHINGTON TO MEET THE PRESS ON A, SUNDAY IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL, DAY LIGHTNING STRUCK MY HOME AND IT BEGAN TO BURN, DOWN IT WAS SO THICK, THE, SMOKE YOU LITERALLY COULD NOT SEE IT INSIDE THE ROOM, EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF FURNITURE FROM BASEMENT THIRD FLOOR WAS GONE, AND THEY SAY MY LEFT LIFE'S LIFE AND MY AS MY WIFE SAYS, BEFORE ME, THEY SAY THE CAT. SO, THEY ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK, AND THESE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE I KNOW THAT COME AND, GOD FORBID, YOU LOSE YOUR HOUSE, YOU BRING YOUR HOUSE, DOWN THERE OUT THE NEXT DAY WITH A BOOT ON THE CORNER RAISING MONEY TO HELP YOU REBUILD YOUR HOUSE. WHEN THEY FINISH THEIR JOB, THEY'RE OUT AT LITTLE LEAGUE FIELDS IN THEY'RE ALWAYS DOING EVERYTHING, SO IT'S NOT JUST THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT, BUT I APPRECIATE THE WAY YOU ARE THE COMMUNITY AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO. THANK YOU. , I APPRECIATE YOUR WIFE BEING HERE AS WELL AND THIS NOVEMBER, WE NEED TO KICK DONALD TRUMP OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE DO SEND STEVE TO THE IOWA STATE SENATE. AND I AM PROUD TO BE JOINED BY A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A LONG, TIME INCREDIBLE FRIEND WHO HAS DONE MORE THAN JUST ABOUT ANYBODY FOR MY CAMPAIGN, RIGHT AROUND ABOUT THE GOLD BUS OF MINE, SHE AND TOM VILSACK, KRISTIE IS DYNAMIC FIRST LADY, SHE WAS HERE IN IOWA. HE CRISSCROSS THE STATE ADVOCATING FOR LITERACY AND IMPROVING EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL COMMUNITIES AND THEN WHEN BARACK AND I GOT ELECTED SHE CAME TO WASHINGTON AND SHE TOOK THAT MESSAGE GLOBALLY, ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION, SHE WORKED WITH USA IDEA AROUND THE WORLD, AND NO ONE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE OPPORTUNITY SHINES AND EVERY CORNER THE WAR BECAUSE THE BETTER EDUCATED WE ARE THE BETTER OFF EVERYBODY IS AND SO I WANT TO THANK KRISTIE FOR ALL SHE'S DONE. LOOK, FOLKS, EVERY FOUR YEARS, DEMOCRACY BEGINS IN IOWA, TO THE GREAT CHAGRIN OF MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY. THEY THINK YOU HAVE DISPROPORTIONATE INFLUENCE, BUT I TELL YOU FOR REAL, YOU WILL TAKE IT REALLY SERIOUSLY, THIS IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL CAUCUS YOU'VE EVER PARTICIPATED, IN NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE PARTICIPATED, NOT BECAUSE JOE BIDEN IS RUNNING, OR ANY ONE CANDIDATE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IS RUNNING, BECAUSE OF THE MAN WHO'S IN THE WHITE HOUSE WE CAN HANDLE FOR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. WE CAN HOPEFULLY GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS AN OPERATION IN HISTORY, BUT YEARS WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE NATURE OF THIS COUNTRY IN MY VIEW AND NOBODY UNDERSTANDS A BETTER THAN ME SO YOU'RE MAKING A SERIOUS CHOICE AND WHAT I TELL PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ASK ME ABOUT IOWA, I, SAY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, YOU LOOK JUST LOOK AT WHAT IN FACT YOU WANT PARTICULARLY IN YOUR STATE, WE LOOK AT WHO IS MOST LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO SEE TO IT THAT WHEN THEY GET OUT OF IOWA THEY CAN SURVIVE OUT OF IOWA AND HAVE A CHANCE OF BECOMING THE NOMINEE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO, SO, SO MUCH AT STAKE THIS TIME IN ONE. AND I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT FOR REAL. YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR PRESIDENT OF LATE. THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WE LEARN ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO. HE WAS TALKING TO INSTEAD OF RESPECTING OUR TROOPS, THERE WAS A REPORT THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED AND NO ONE HAS DENIED IT, THAT HE WENT OVER TO THE PENTAGON AND WHAT THEY CALL, ANYWAYS, HE WENT TO THE PENTAGON TO MEET WITH THE FLAG OFFICERS AND GENERALS, AND HE REFERRED TO THEM IS LOSERS, DOPES, AND BABIES. I HONESTLY GOT CAN'T THINK OF ANY TIME IN THE PAST OR ANY PRESIDENT HAS EVER LOOKED AT OUR LAWYERS WHO SAID THINGS LIKE THAT TO THEM, ALLEGEDLY TO THEIR FACES. MY MOTHER WOULD, SAY I DON'T KNOW WHO DIED AND LEFT HIM, BOSS NO, BUT THINK ABOUT IT, THINK ABOUT IT, I TALK ABOUT CHARACTER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND THEN WE LEARNED,, WE LEAVE AT 34 OF OUR WARRIORS WHO WERE STATIONED IN IRAQ WHERE MY SON'S BEEN HERE BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY,, BY SOUND AND ALL OF THOSE WARS WHERE THEY, ARE 34 OF, THEM STATION IN, IRAQ DURING THE MISSILE ATTACK BY THE IRANIANS AND 34 HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND WHAT DID PRESIDENT TRUMP SAY? HE SAID NOBODY REALLY GOT HURT, IT WASN'T VERY SERIOUS, JUST HEADACHES. JUST HEADACHES. WELL, THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME THAT. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. BUT YOU KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN OVER 300,000 OVER THE LAST 12 YEARS ACCORDING TO INNATE BUT TO BE SO CAVALIER, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THESE WARRIORS, JUST HEADACHES AND FOLKS, THE FACT IS THAT THE VFW A , FOREIGN WAR WHICH HAS NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY POLITICAL ABOUT YET CAME OUT AND SAID THEY CALLED ON HIM TO APOLOGIZE, TO APOLOGIZE TO OUR WARRIORS FOR SAYING THAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT HE HAS OR HAS NOT. MY GUESS IS HE PROBABLY HAS NOT. LET'S BE CLEAR, OUR TROOPS DESERVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT WE OWE THEM 1% OF OUR POPULATION DEFENDS 99% OF US NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO INHERIT A COUNTRY THAT IS DIVIDED, AS WELL AS AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN DISARRAY. IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE TIME FOR ON THE JOB TRAINING, NOT MUCH TIME AT ALL FOUR ON THE JOB TRAINING. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO ON DAY ONE CAN COMMAND THE WORLD STAGE BECAUSE HE OR SHE KNOWS THOSE LEADERS, HERE ARE SHE IS KNOWN BY THEM, SOMEONE WHO CAN LEAD OUR ARMED FORCES, AND REPAIR OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR ALLIES THAT HAVE BEEN SO BADLY DAMAGED BY HIS EMBRACE OF THUGS AND DICTATORS AROUND THE WORLD AND ONCE MORE MAKE THE UNITED STATES THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. FOLKS, WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS THAT AS YOUR FUTURE SENATORS SAID EARLIER THAT THIS, COUNTRY WAS NOT GO BY WALL STREET YES BUT BUILT BY ORDINARY MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS. YOU CAN HAVE A CHANCE. THEY ARE THE ONE IN RURAL AMERICA THE CITY,. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT BUILT THIS COUNTRY. GIVEN HALF A CHANCE THEY HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN, THEY ARE PROBABLY COME FROM FAMILIES LIKE I DID. WE NEVER THOUGHT WE WERE POOR, BUT I GUESS WE TECHNICALLY WERE. WE WERE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS IN TERMS OF INCOME, AND THEN AFTER MY DAD DID THAT WORK UP AND GRANT, AND PENNSYLVANIA, HE WAS NOT A COAL MINER, MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WHAT WAS, HE WAS NOT A COAL MINER TO SALES PERSON. THERE WERE NO JOB SO HE WENT DOWN TO DELAWARE AND HE WAS RAISED THERE ALMOST ONE THIRD GRADE TWO 11TH GRADE AND WE WENT BACK DOWN AND IT TOOK HIM THREE YEARS TO BE ABLE TO GET US HOME, AND WE HAD THREE BEDROOM HOME, SPLIT LEVEL, HOME NICE PLACE, FOR KIDS AND A GRAND POP, WELL, WE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST FINE, BUT FOLKS, THE POINT IS THAT THERE WAS NEVER ANY TIME WE THOUGHT THERE WAS AN ABUNDANCE OF, ANYTHING WHERE WE HAD FAMILY, WE HAD VALUES, AND WE ALL CARE ABOUT THE SAME THING YOU GUYS CARE ABOUT OUT HERE IN IOWA, DECENCY, HONOR, COMMITMENT, SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOURSELF, KNOWING IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT YOU. SO, FOLKS, LOOK. AND THE PROBLEM NOW, THE ONLY THING STANDING IN OUR WAY OF REBUILDING THIS COUNTRY, AND WE HAVE TO, REBUILD IS OUR BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM. OUR POLITICS HAS BECOME SO, MEAN SO, PETTY SO BUSINESS THAT WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, UNITE THE COUNTRY, UNITE OUR COUNTRY FLAT, OUT FOLKS, WE ARE DEMOCRACY, DEMOCRACIES DEPEND ON CONSENSUS. YOU HAVE TO REACH CONSENSUS. THREE IS NO WAY TO BE ABLE TO GOVERN, TO PROGRESS IF WE CANNOT REACH CONSENSUS SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PULL THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE RACE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE THINK I'M NAIVE IN BELIEVING WE CAN UNIFY THE COUNTRY. NO, IT IS NOT NAIVE, IS WHAT I'VE DONE MY WHOLE POLITICAL CAREER, POINT TO GET THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE PAST, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, ACT THE RECOVERY, ACT A WHOLE RANK OF THINGS LIKE UNLISTED A LONGER THAN WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DONE IN THIS CAMPAIGN SO FAR BECAUSE IT CAN BE DONE, IF YOU TREAT PEOPLE WITH RESPECT, I DON'T ATTACK THEIR MOTIVE, YOU DON'T ATTACK THEIR JUDGMENT, YOU SAY, YOU ARE WRONG, ONCE OR ATTACK YOUR MOTIVE AND SAY YOU'RE IN THE POCKET, OF AND YOU ARE THIS IN THAT, AND I SAY, LET'S WORK OUT A BILL TO REBUILD THE HIGHWAYS, YES, FAT CHANCE, BUT IF I NEVER QUESTION YOUR MOTIVE AND I JUST QUESTION YOUR JUDGMENT WE CAN ALWAYS END UP IN A COMPROMISE AND GET SOMETHING DONE. AND THERE IS SO MUCH THAT WE ARE ABLE TO GET DONE IN MY VIEW. AND FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS THAT AS I SAID, I AM TOLD THAT I AM NAIVE AND THEY SAY YES, JOE HAS DONE AN AWFUL LOT, JOE IS BEEN ABLE TO PULL PEOPLE TOGETHER BEFORE, THEY JOE DID THIS THAT IN THE OTHER, THING EVERY TIME THERE WAS A DRAMA WITH A REPUBLICAN HOUSE OR SENATE, WHEN WE WERE VICE PRESIDENT VICE PRESIDENT, I WAS THE GUY WHO FIXED, IT WELL THAT WAS THE OLD DAYS. THAT WAS THREE YEARS AGO BUT NOW THEY SAY THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT IT. I UNDERSTAND IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY. I HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT OF THEIR AFFECTION FOR A LONG TIME. I HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT OF THEIR AFFECTION. I TELL YOU, WHAT MAN, IT'S JUST BEEN AMAZING HOW MUCH THEY LOVE ME. ONE OF THE EVER HAD A PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, A SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SPEND OVER 12 TO 15 MILLION DOLLARS RUNNING NEGATIVE ADS THAT WERE FLAT OUT LIES ABOUT A PERSON IT WAS NOT EVEN THE NOMINEE YET? I WONDER WHAT HE IS AFRAID OF AND THEN YOU KNOW, JUST KIND OF AMAZING BUT LOOK, FOLKS, YOU TAKE A LOOK AT, IT IS NOT DOES THE PRESIDENT. I THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF FASCINATING. LET'S BE CLEAR. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO WENT OUT THERE AND COLLUDED WITH A FOREIGN POWER TO TRY TO SMEAR ME. NO ONE UNDER OATH OR ANY UNDERWAY HAS EVER SUGGESTED I DID ANYTHING OTHER THAN MY JOB IS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND DID IT AS HIS LEADING OF ADMINISTRATIONS UNDER OATH WE'VE COMPLETE TARGETING HONESTY CARRYING OUT A POLICY UNITED STATES BUT OF ALL OF ALLIES AND ALL OF EUROPE, AND REDUCE CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE. THE FACT IS THAT THEY SLANDERED ME AND SLANDERED MY ONLY SURVIVING SON AND BY THE WAY, YOU SEE JONI THE OTHER DAY? WHOA. SHE SPILLED THE BEANS. YOU KNOW, SHE JUST CAME OUT, THE WHOLE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL FOR TRUMP WAS JUST A BIT OF POLITICAL HIT JOB,, IT IS NOT, IT IS HOW SCARED TRUMP IS TO RUNNING IT, AND, LOOK HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID. IOWA CAUCUSES, I WILL CALL THIS IS A NEXT MONDAY. I REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THIS DISCUSSION, MEANING, THE DISCUSSION ABOUT ME ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE WITH REPUBLICAN PROSECUTORS,, HOW THIS DISCUSSION TODAY, TWO DAYS AGO, INFORMS AND INFLUENCES IOWA CAUCUS VOTERS. WILL THEY BE SUPPORTING VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AT THIS POINT? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THAT IS JUST FLOODED ACKNOWLEDGING, WE'VE BEEN DOING WHATEVER WE CAN TO KEEP BIDEN FROM BEING THE NOMINEE AND WE TRIED TO DO, IT AND IRAQ IS NOT WORKING AND OUR GOING TO TRY, I MEAN, RAND, EXCUSE, ME THEY TRY TO UKRAINE, GOT US IN A WAR IN IRAN, PEOPLE GOT HURT IN IRAQ, FOLKS, I, MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF ALICE IN WONDERLAND. ONE COMMENTATOR CALLED, IN AND I WANT TO QUOTE, THIS, BECAUSE IT IS LIKE SCREAMING THE QUIET PART INTO THE BOULEVARD, AND THAT GIVES US THE WONDERFUL NEWS SENATOR FROM FLORIDA, RICK SCOTT, ONE OF THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN AMERICA. HE STARTED RUNNING ADS HERE IN IOWA AGAINST ME WELL, GOD LOVE, HIM AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, HE IS SO INTERESTED, HE IS INTERESTED FROM A SENATOR FROM FLORIDA AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD WIN AN IOWA CAUCUS. ISN'T THAT FASCINATING? I GUESS IF I HAD THAT MUCH MONEY EXPENDED ON ANYTHING I COULD BUT, PRETTY AMAZING. THINK ABOUT, IT FROM THE CENTER FROM FLORIDA SITTING IN WASHINGTON, AS HARD TO START RUNNING NEGATIVE, ADS SINCE A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THE IOWA CAUCUS, NOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. IT SEEMS PRETTY SIMPLE TO ME. THEY ARE TRYING TO SMEAR ME TO STOP ME. THEY KNOW IF I AM NOT THE NOMINEE, , IF I AM THE NOMINEE, I'M GOING TO BE DONALD TRUMP. SO, SO, IOWA CAUCUS GOERS ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A TWOFER. ONE, IF I COME OUT OF HERE AS A WINNER, OVERRULE DONALD TRUMP'S NIGHT AND TO, YOU WILL RUIN JR.'S NIGHT AS WELL. AND I'M SURE THE SENATOR FROM FLORIDA LOVES THE RECENT POLLS, ANYWAY, IN FLORIDA, LOOK, NO MATTER HOW PERSONAL THESE TEXTS , THESE ATTACKS, ARE ON A SERIOUS, NOTE AGAINST ME IN MY FAMILY, PRESIDENTS CAN'T HOLD GRUDGES. WE REALLY CAN'T BECAUSE THIS FIGHT IS NOT ABOUT ME IN MY FAMILY, IT IS ABOUT YOU AND YOUR KIDS, BUT YOUR GRANDKIDS, ABOUT THE COUNTRY AND I THINK IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE PRESIDENT NOT ONLY HAS TO NOTIFY, BUT THE NEXT PRESIDENT GOING TO HAVE TO HEAL AND YET KNOW HOW TO HEAL THE COUNTRY BUT SOMETHING ELSE IS ON THE BALLOT COME NOVEMBER. AND THAT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, CHARACTER. CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT. AMERICA'S CHARACTER. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE OUGHT TO DARK, ANGRY NATION BC IN DONALD TRUMP'S TWEETS. AT THREE IN THE MORNING. . TWEETING BIRD. ANYWAY. THINK ABOUT, IT THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. READ THEM SOMETIME, LIKE LISTEN TO, THEM LOOK AT THEM, THEY ARE BIZARRE. I DON'T BELIEVE IN A NATION THAT PUTS KIDS IN CAGES AND THINKS IT'S OKAY. I DON'T BELIEVE, I DON'T THINK WE ARE A NATION THAT WHIPS OF HYSTERIA, SAYS WERE GOING TO BE BUILD A WALL AND IN FACT SAYS IMMIGRANTS ARE ABOUT TO INVADE AND TAKE US OVER AND RAPE US FROM MEXICO, BUT THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I DON'T BELIEVE WE ARE A NATION THAT EMBRACES WHITE SUPREMACIST LIKE THIS GUY HAS BEEN DOING. THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE EITHER. AND I DON'T BELIEVE WE ARE A NATION THAT VOWS DOWN TO VLADIMIR PUTIN BECAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU I WILL NOT. I DON'T BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK THAT THE FREE PRESS IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. WE SOUND LIKE SOME KIND , OF I WON'T EVEN SAY. IT SERIOUSLY, THINK ABOUT IT, LIKE ABOUT HOW WE TALK. PRESIDENT HAVE YOU EVER HEARD SPEAK LIKE THIS BEFORE? I DON'T BELIEVE WE ARE A NATION THAT BELIEVES THE U.S. CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE LAUGHED AT, MOCKED OR IGNORED. I LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT HE STANDS, FOR HOW HE BEHAVED AND WHAT HE DOES, AND MY RESPONSE IS ALWAYS THE SAME WE: HAVE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICAN, WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. I BELIEVE THERE IS WHAT THE NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST DAVID BROOKS CALLS AN AMBITIOUS , AN INVISIBLE FABRIC THAT BOND THIS NATION TOGETHER. HE TALKS ABOUT GOOD CITIZENS, HE TALKS ABOUT THE GREEK PHRASE FOR A GOOD CITIZEN. HE TALKS ABOUT THAT WHAT WE KNOW, WE KNOW WHAT THAT MORAL FABRIC IS. IT IS HONESTY, DECENCY, TREATING EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. GIVING EVERYBODY A FAIR SHOT. GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. LEAVING NOBODY BEHIND. LEAVING NOBODY BEHIND. DEMONIZING NO ONE, THE POOR, THE IMMIGRANT, THE OTHER. LEADING BY EXAMPLE, NOT JUST THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER. STANDING IS A BEACON OF HOPE FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD LOOKING AT US. THAT SHINING CITY ON THE HILL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS A CODE. IT IS A CODE. IT IS THE AMERICAN CODE. FOR SOME REASON THIS PRESIDENT JUST AS NOT GET IT. FOR SOME REASON THIS PRESIDENT DOES NOT BELIEVE IN IT. HE IS SNOOZING. HE THINKS HE MAKES AS WEAK. AND I CAN'T READ EXACTLY TO BE YEAR AND A HALF AGO HE SAID ALL THE STUFF ABOUT LEANING IT, REACHING OUT, MAKES YOU A SUCKER. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. WE ALL, ALL OF, US NO MATTER WHERE WE ARE FROM, BASICALLY, FUNDAMENTAL, WHAT I CALL AMERICAN VALUES,. DECENTLY , DECENCY, HONESTY, RESPECT, WE DON'T ALWAYS LIVE UP TO, WHAT WE'VE NEVER ACTUALLY DISMISSED IT. FOLKS, HE THINKS THAT IT MAKES US WEAK BUT HE IS DEAD WRONG. IT MAKES A STRONG. IT IS WHO WE, ARE THAT IS THE GLUE THAT HOLDS THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER AND THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED AND CAN COME TOGETHER. WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. FOLKS, I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES AS YOUR PRESIDENT TO MAKE PROGRESS ON MATTERS THAT MATTER THE MOST, REBUILDING THE MIDDLE CLASS, CIVIL LIBERTIES, CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, AND WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, HEALTH CARE, RATIONAL GUN POLICY SOAK HIS DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND LEARN HOW TO DUCK AND COVER IN THEIR FIRST, SECOND, OR THIRD GRADE, AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT JUST WELL, CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY, THAT WILL SAVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN ON THIS PLANET, IS THE MOST URGENT NEED WE HAVE. LOOK, EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP. IS EVEN HIS SUPPORTERS, THEY MAKE NO QUALMS ABOUT. IT EVEN HIS SUPPORTERS, FIND A STRONG TRUMP SUPPORTER AND ASK IF THEY WOULD HAVE A CHILD WHO THEY WOULD WANT TO GROW UP WITH DONALD TRUMP'S VALUES. I'M NOT JOKING, IT IS A DIFFERENT VALUES THAT THIS MAN HAS, DONE I, THINK IS WHO WE, ARE AND IT IS DAMAGING US BADLY AROUND THE WORLD IT IS DAMAGING US AND PUTTING US AT HOME. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DONE IN THE TIME HE'S BEEN ELECTED HAS BEEN TO DIVIDE US. DO THIS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, HE CAME DOWN THAT ESCALATOR ANNOUNCING HIS PRESIDENCY, STARTED OFF AND SAID, WE'RE GOING TO GET RID, OF WERE GOING TO GET RID OF THOSE MEXICAN RAPISTS, AND WENT ON FROM THERE. AND WHAT YOU SAW WHEN ALL THIS VOTE CAME OUT OF THAT FIELD IN VIRGINIA? IN CHARLOTTESVILLE? CARRY THOSE CHARGES, CLOSE YOUR EYES REMEMBER WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE. CLOSE YOUR EYES, WHAT YOU SAW ON TELEVISION, COMING OUT OF FIELDS WITH TORCHES, CARRYING TORCHES BY THE HUNDREDS, WELCOME TO THE STREETS, THERE VEINS BULGING, SPEWING HATE, CITING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT WAS CHANTED IN THE STREETS OF EUROPE IN GERMANY IN THE THIRTIES, CARRYING SWASTIKAS, ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN, AND A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED. AND WHAT DID THEY ASK , THEY ASKED THE PRESIDENT, WHAT DO YOU THINK, MISTER PRESIDENT. DO YOU MOVE WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID, THEY WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. NO PRESIDENT. FOLKS, THIS IS NOT JUST AN ETHICS LESSON. IT IS AS RICH AS THE FABRIC OF WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY IT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. LIKE I SAID, EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE WILL KNOW WHO WE ARE. FOLKS, WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE, SCIENCE OVER FICTION. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION, AS WE ALWAYS HAVE AND WE YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER LAW IS. SO, FOLKS, REMEMBER I, REALLY MEAN, THIS REMEMBER, WE ARE WALKING DOWN WITH OUR HEADS DOWN LIKE, WHOA IS US. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE HAS NEVER, NEVER, NEVER BEEN A SINGLE THING , THIS IS LITERAL. NEVER BEEN A SINGLE THING WE HAVE SET OUR MIND TO THAT WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO, BUT WE'VE DONE IT TOGETHER. SO LET'S TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK IN THE NATION WE CAN BE AND SHOULD BE. THANK YOU. FOLKS, THANK YOU. FOLKS, HE TOLD ME I'M'S WAS TO CATCH A PLANE TO DES MOINES TO TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS. I WANT TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS, BY STAFF WILL KILL ME IN THAT I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO CHRISTY VILSACK, BUT ANYBODY ELSE, IF YOU CAN GET ME , IF YOU DON'T ASK AS A QUESTIONS, I CAN DO THEM QUICKLY BUT IF IT IS YES OR NO, I CAN DO IT EVEN MORE QUICKLY. DON'T BELIEVE ME. I'M USED TO. BULLIES NOT A, JOKE I WAS A, KID I WAS A PRETTY GOOD ATHLETE, I WAS THE SECOND HIGHEST SCORE IN FOOTBALL IN MY STATE. I WAS A PRETTY GOOD BASEBALL PLAYER. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THE THING THAT WAS A PROBLEM FOR ME WAS WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO STUTTER AND EVERYBODY THINKS THEY CAN MAKE FUN OF US DAUGHTER. IT IS HARD TO ASK THE GIRL OUT TO THE EIGHTH GRADE DATE. THEY DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY, BUT THINK ABOUT, IT IF I TOLD YOU I HAD A CLEFT LIP, OR RIGHT HAD WITHERED ARM, YOU WOULD'VE LASTED IT ALL. WE THINK WE CAN LAUGH AT IT SO, I'M USED TO BULLIES. THAT'S WHERE I LEARNED TO FIGHT. NOT A JOKE, BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT BOYS ARE. AT THEIR CORE, BULLIES ARE COWARDS. AT THEIR CORE, THEY ARE COWARDS. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WANNA TRY NOT TO DO. I'M GOING TO TRY TO RESIST MY IRISH TEMPER AND NOT GET DOWN TO THE MOSH PIT WITH THIS FELLA. I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE THING. AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE LAST ELECTION. I CAMPAIGNED , DID 84 EVENTS FOR HILLARY ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AFTER THE ELECTION WAS ALL OVER, THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY , THERE IS A SCHOOL CALLED THE SHORN SKIN SCHOOL AT HARVARD. THEY DID A STUDY OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS WRITTEN OR SAID ABOUT HILLARY DURING THE CAMPAIGN IN THE PRESS AND THE MEDIA AND THEY WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OF , HOW MUCH MORE RELATED ISSUES, SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH RELATED TO ISSUES? 4%. F OH YOU ARE. SO WE ALL THOUGHT, WHEN HE INCLUDE, INITIALLY WHEN YOU TALKED, ABOUT IT ONCE IN FRONT OF THE CHILDREN, BUT BEING ABLE TO GRAB WOMEN WHEREVER HE COULD, AND HE COULD SHOOT SOMEONE ON FIFTH AVENUE GET AWAY WITH IT, AND WE TALKED ABOUT, PEOPLE WE ALL SAW , THOUGHT THAT WAS A DEAD SET LOSER FOR HIM. BUT GUESS WHAT, IT IS THE ONLY PLACE HE'S COMFORTABLE ARGUING. IT IS WHAT IS USED. DO I'M SERIOUS. HE DOES NOT KNOW THE ISSUES SO, I'M GOING TO TRY, I'M NOT GOING TO BE AT ALL RELUCTANT TO TAKE ON THE PRESIDENT. I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO DEBATE HIM BUT ALL KIDDING ASIDE, THE BEST WAY TO POINT OUT WHY HE SHOULD BE PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE HE DOES NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH IT. I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS. IN TERMS OF FOREIGN POLICY, IN TERMS OF DOMESTIC POLICY, IN TERMS OF THE MAJOR ISSUES, HEALTH CARE, DID YOU REALIZE? I DIDN'T KNOW, THIS I THOUGHT BARACK AND I DID THIS, HE WAS SAYING TWO WEEKS AGO, THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS COVERED IS BECAUSE OF, MEAT DONALD J TRUMP. LOW. SO I'M GOING TO TRY MY BEST AND IF I'M, NOT GOING TO CALL MY SISTER, GRABBED JOE BY THE AIR AND PULL HIM, OUT BUT I PROMISE YOU, I'M NOT GOING TO. I WOULD TAKE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS. YES SIR. THAT'S AN ESSAY BUT I'LL DO IT QUICKLY. THE FIRST THINGS I WOULD DO IN THE FIRST 90 DAYS IS I WOULD IMMEDIATELY SEND AN IMMIGRATION BILL TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND HOUSE THAT IN FACT WE PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP AND SECONDLY I WOULD IMMEDIATELY REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. AND I WOULD INVITE THE CLOSE TO 200 MEMBERS THAT ARE , NATIONS THAT ARE MEMBER OF THAT ACCORD TO THE AUDIENCE LIKE WE DID WITH THE NUCLEAR PROVOCATION ENGINE HAPPENED SIT DOWN AND AGREE THAT WERE GOING TO HAVE TO UP THE ANTE BECAUSE WHEN WE WALKED, OUT EVERYTHING COLLAPSED. NOTHING IS HAPPENING. WE HAVE TO LEAD THE WORLD. AND EVEN IF WE DO WHAT MY PROPOSAL CALLS, FOR AN OF THIS AS WELL, AND ELIMINATED BY THE TIME WE GET A NET ZERO, MISSIONS GUESS, WHAT WE WOULD GET RID OF 50% OF THE PROBLEM UNITED STATES. 85% OF THE PROBLEMS THE REST OF THE WORLD SO, WE COULD BE A NET ZERO EMITTER OF ANY POLLUTANT. NOT ZERO AND WE ARE STILL GOT TO HAVE YOUR RIVERS FLOODING. WE ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE THIS AWFUL WEATHER CONDITIONS. WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE GLACIERS MELTING. WE ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE CHILDREN GETTING SICK OR AND SICK OR BECAUSE OF THE AIR AND ASTHMA AND A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. WERE GOING TO BE IN REAL TROUBLE SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO MY WHOLE CAREER, I SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME BRING INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES TOGETHER, AND FOR, REAL WHETHER THERE IS ORGANIZING 61 NATIONS TO TAKE DOWN ISIS WITHOUT US HAVING TO COMMIT HUNDREDS OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS TO TAKE THEM ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST OR WHATEVER IT WAS, THAT IS WHAT I HAVE DONE AND SO THAT IS THE SECOND THING I WOULD DO RIGHT OFF THE BAT AND IT GOES ON FROM THERE BUT THAT IS WHAT I WOULD DO. LAST QUESTION. SIR. I LIKE YOUR LID. I DO TOO. TAX BREAKS, THE TAX, WARS CHINA TAX. IT HAS DESTROYED OUR ECONOMY. I JUST GOT WORD THAT MINNESOTA HAD A RECORD BREAKING NUMBERS OF LOSSES OF FARMERS IN HISTORY. OUR FARMERS IN IOWA HAVE LOST ALMOST EVERYTHING. SMALL BUSINESS HAS LOST EVERYTHING AND THE CONSUMERS HAVE LOST EVERYTHING. WHAT CAN YOU DO TO CHANGE THAT? IMMEDIATELY, LOOK AT HIS TRADE POLICIES AND HERE'S WHAT WE WILL DO. LOOK, I KNOW THAT I COME FROM AN AGRICULTURAL STATE. WE ALL THINK I WHAT IS THE ONLY STATE THOSE AGRICULTURE ARE, BUT THE POTENTIAL OF THE GOES DOWN THE DELAWARE RIVER, THE CHESAPEAKE BAY DOWN TO THE POTOMAC IS A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY OF AGRICULTURE, MOSTLY CHICKENS AND SOYBEANS AND SO I UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE ON HIS POLICIES. WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE AND PHASE ONE OF HIS NEW TRADE POLICY WITH CHINA IS JUST TAKING FARMERS BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE DAY WE LEFT OFFICE. THAT'S ALL IT'S DONE. AFTER IT HAVING COST US, THE FARMERS IN THE TAXPAYERS, OVER 24 BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE UP THE LOSSES TO THE FARMERS, I DON'T BEGRUDGE THAT BECAUSE OF HIS TERRIBLE POLICY. WE SPENT SO MUCH MORE MONEY ON BAILING OUT THE FARMERS BECAUSE OF HIS GOT AWFUL POLICY AND NOT LEAVING THEM HOLE AT THE END OF THE DAY ANYWAY. THEN, WE DID THE BAILOUT GENERAL MOTORS IN THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY. JUST PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, SO THE IDEA THAT LOTS OF TIMES WHEN THINGS AFFECT OUR STATE AND A COMES IN WE THINK, THAT DOESN'T COST ANYTHING, WILL COST TAXPAYERS AROUND THE COUNTRY AT THE 24 BILLION DOLLARS HERE BUT ALSO AROUND THE COUNTRY AND SO, IT IS LEFT FARMERS IN A VERY PRECARIOUS SITUATION. AND LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE WITH ETHANOL. WE SPEND 100 MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR ADMINISTRATION MAKING SURE THAT GAS PUMPS CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO BE ABLE TO CARRY ETHANOL GASOLINE WITH ETHANOL. OKAY? SO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF POLLUTION. 100 MILLION DOLLARS AND WHAT DOES HE DO? MADE A DEAL WITH EGGS ON THE BREAK THE DEAL. LOOK HOW MANY OF THE PLANTS HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN. THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE MAKING 15 DOLLARS AN HOUR. THIS IS FARMERS BEING ABLE TO SELL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CORN FOR THIS ETHANOL, REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE BUT ALSO IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE FACTORIES THAT PRODUCE THIS, THEY'RE MAKING ABOUT 45 TO 50 DOLLARS AN HOUR. THEY ARE GOOD PAYING JOBS, WITH BENEFITS BEYOND IT, IT IS RAISE THE ECONOMY OF IOWA, INITIALLY, PEOPLE BEGINNING TO MAKE AND RURAL AREAS A GOOD, DECENT SALARY SO, INTENT STEADFAST DOING WHAT WE DID, WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID THE FARMERS WITH REGARD TO ETHANOL AND SO THEY LOST, THINGS WE SHOULD BE INVESTING MORE MONEY, MORE MONEY IN AMERICAN FARMERS AND LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT IOWA, RIGHT HERE IN IOWA. GO ON JOE BIDEN .COM AND LOOK AT MY AGRICULTURE SLASH ENVIRONMENTAL PLAN. WE SHOULD BE PAYING FARMERS, NUMBER ONE, TO PUT MORE LAND IN CONSERVATION. WE SHOULD BE PAYING, THEM PAY THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR DOING THIS, IN ADDITION TO THE PRODUCT, THEY ARE TAKING A MARKET TO SELL. WE ALSO SHOULD BE PAYING FARMERS TO TRANSFER A LOT OF THEIR LAND THAT THEY HAVE INTO CARBON ABSORPTION. TAKING THE ROOT OF PLANTS, BEING ABLE TO DRAW CARBON OUT OF THE YEAR THAT DOES NOT POLLUTE THE EARTH BUT IT IS BURIED BENEATH THE SOIL AND DOES NOT CAUSE ANY OF THE GLOBAL WARMING. AND IT SHOULD BE PAID FOR. THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PUT FARMERS IN A POSITION WHERE THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY AND DO A LOT OF GOOD FOR EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY IN THE CITIES, EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY ALL OVER THE WORLD AND SO THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON AND ON CHINA WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON DEALING WITH CHINA AND THE THINGS THAT MATTER TO OUR ECONOMY, THEY ARE STEALING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THEY'RE DEMANDING IT BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BUSINESS IN CHINA, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A 51% CHINESE BUSINESS PARTNER WHICH MEANS, THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ALL YOUR TRADE SECRETS AND IT MEANS THAT OVER TIME, THEY WILL JUST STOP US UP WHAT WE HAVE. WE ARE NOT INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY. CHINA IS NOW A 5G COUNTRY. THEY ARE INVESTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN HIGH TECH MATERIAL. WE ARE NOT MAKING THE SAME INVESTMENTS HERE, AND WE ARE GETTING A 1.9 TRILLION DOLLAR TAX, CUT MOST OF WHICH IS GOING TO THE TOP 2%. BUT THEY DON'T NEED. IT THEY ARE JUST. WHY THEY HAVE FORUMS, THEY CAN KEEP ALL FOUR OF IT. SO, LOOK, FOLKS. THE LAST POINT I WILL MAKE, I WAS GOING TO GET INTO THIS BUT I WILL JUST FOR A SECOND NOW, YOU TALK ABOUT TAXES. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP, PRESUMPTUOUS OF ME TO SAY THIS, WHOEVER OUR NOMINEE IS, IS AUTHENTIC,, STRAIGHTFORWARD TELLS THE TRUTH WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING TO, DO WHAT IT'S GONNA COST HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT. NOW, WHEN I TALK ABOUT DEALING WITH PROVIDING HEALTH CARE WITH EVERYBODY, I TALK ABOUT BUILDING ON THE OBAMACARE WHICH I HELPED PASS FOR THE PRESIDENT, ADDING THE PUBLIC OPTION, ADDING A PUBLIC OPTION, IF THERE IS A MEDICARE LIKE OPTION AND FURTHER SUBSIDIZING AND MAKING IT CHEAPER TO BUY IN AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY, IF YOU IN FACT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID UNDER GOVERNORS REALLY SCREWED THAT UP IN THIS STATE, WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE LIKE OPTIONS. THAT COST A LOT OF MONEY. MY PLAN COST, TO DO, THAT ABOUT 740 BILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS. I MAKE ONE CHANGE TO PAY FOR IT ALL AND I'LL GET REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR THIS ONE AND THAT IS THAT WE TAKE , WE TALK TO CAPITAL GAINS AT THE INCOME TAX DOUBT SO, RIGHT NOW, CAPITAL GAINS TAXES 20%. NO MATTER HOW MUCH , WHATEVER YOU TALK STRUCTURE IS. WHY SHOULD SOMEONE, IF WE TALK TO REWARD HIM WHERE THEY'RE NOT JUST WELL, WHY SHOULD YOUR SECRETARY, IF YOU ARE MILLIONAIRE, PAY AT A HIGHER TAX RATE THAN YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING? IF YOU DID JUST THAT, THE TAX RATE IS 30%, CAPITAL, GAINS TO GIVE 30%, I'M GOING TO RAISE IT THE 39.6% WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE HIGHEST RATE, ATOP, RATE YOU PAY 39.6%. YOU SEE HOW MUCH MONEY THAT RAISES? 800 BILLION DOLLARS. IT'S DOING THAT. I COME FROM THE CORPORATE STATE OF AMERICA, DELAWARE, MORE CORPORATIONS THERE THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE, REALLY, TRULY, NOW, TAX RATE HAS BEEN REDUCED TO 20%. BARACK AND I THOUGHT IT COULD BE REDUCED TO 24 36%, BUT IF WE RAISE IT TO 20%, AND BY, THE WAY NUMBER TO PAY ANY TAX AT ALL, THAT RAISES 730 BILLION DOLLARS. CORPORATE AMERICA IS HAVING THE BEST RUN OF THEIR LIVES. THEY'RE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY. DON'T PUNISH, THEM TO START TO PAY YOUR FAIR SHARE AND IF YOU PUT A MINIMUM TAX ON CORPORATIONS, YOU HAVE, AMAZON A BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION, THEY PAY ZERO. NOTHING. NOT A SINGLE SENT. NOT A SINGLE CENT BECAUSE THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SO MANY LOOPHOLES. WELL, IF WE JUST MAKE SURE THE CORPORATIONS AREN'T PAYING, ANYTHING PAID A MINIMUM OF 15%, NO MATTER WHAT EXEMPTIONS THEY HAVE, IF YOU 15%, THAT RAISES A TOTAL OF 400 400 BILLION DOLLARS NO. THESE ARE THINGS THAT EVEN REPUBLICAN THE RESERVE AGAINST. I ASK A REPUBLICAN NEIGHBORS WHETHER WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT REDUCING DRUG PRICES. MY GUESS IS , I GUESS IS NO, THEY WON'T, SAY WE'D LIKE THE HIGH, PRICES LET'S KEEP IN THAT, WAY THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO QUADRUPLE OR TRIPLE WHATEVER THE DRUG PRICE FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT CHANGED SO, FOLKS, HERE IS THE DEAL. WE CAN PROVIDE FOR, WITHOUT PUNISHING ANYBODY JUST A RATIONAL TAX POLICY BASED ON THE RIDICULOUS CHANGES THIS PRESIDENT MADE TAX POLICY. WE CAN PAY FOR EVERYTHING FROM EDUCATION STRAIGHT THROUGH TO DEALING WITH WOBBLE WARMING AND JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING. LAST EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, MY WIFE IS A PROFESSOR. SHE'S AN EDUCATOR. SHE IS TAUGHT IN THE HIGH SCHOOL INITIATIVES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND BY THE WAY, I GET SO TIRED OF THE MAIL COMING, DOCTOR AND JOE BIDEN THAT WHEN I LEFT THE VICE PRESIDENCY, I BECAME A FULL PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA BUT GUESS, WHAT IS STILL CAME DOCTOR AND JOE BIDEN, NOTHING CHANGED, BUT AS JILL SAID, NO, JOKE, SHE SAYS ANY COUNTRY WITH EDUCATION IS GOING TO COMPETE US. WELL, LOOK, YOU HAVE, WHY SHOULD A CHILD'S ABILITY TO LEARN DEPEND ON WHAT IS IT COULD THEY COME FROM, THEY LIVE IN. SO, IF YOU DID ONE THING, AND THIS IS NOT EVEN A BIG TICKET ITEM IN TERMS OF A TRILLION DOLLAR BUDGET, IF YOU JUST TOOK WHAT THEY CALLED TITLE I, SCHOOLS SCHOOLS THAT ARE SCHOOLS THAT DO NOT HAVE A HIGH TAX BASE AND CANNOT PROVIDE A LOT OF MONEY TO PAY TEACHERS OR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS OR ALL OF THOSE THINGS, OKAY, IF YOU JUST TOOK THIS THING CALLED TITLE ONE PROGRAM PROVIDES BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THIS A LONG TIME AGO, 15 BILLION DOLLARS EXTRA THAT CAN BE SPREAD AROUND THESE TITLE I SCHOOLS THAT ARE IN RURAL AREAS A LOT AS WELL AS IN URBAN AREAS, NOW, IF YOU CHANGE THAT FROM 15 TO 45 BILLION, YOU TRIPLE IT OVER THE PERIOD, WHAT HAPPENS? YOU'RE ABLE TO BEGIN TO PAY EVERY TEACHER IN THESE SCHOOLS THAT COMPETITIVE WAGE FOR TEACHERS IN THE HIGHER PRICE SCHOOLS. WHY? IF YOU HAVE A SON OR DAUGHTER OR ANY OF YOU ARE IN EDUCATOR, WHEN YOU GRADUATED FROM SCHOOL YOU GOT YOUR DEGREE AND, IF YOU GRADUATED MAGNET COME LOUDLY YOU STARTED OFF WITH 23.5% LESS SALARY THAN EVERYONE ELSE GRADUATING EXCEPT IN THE ONE AREA MY DAUGHTER WENT AND GOT HER MASTERS DEGREE IN AND THAT IS DEALING WITH SOCIAL WHERE WELFARE ISSUES YOU KNOW, ANYWAY, I WISH I HAD ONE REPUBLICAN KID. I'M ONLY KIDDING. BUT ALL KIDDING ASIDE, WHY SHOULD THAT BE? NOW, RIGHT NOW WE ARE 115,000 TEACHERS SHORT IN AMERICA IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. THAT IS PREDICTED TO GO TO AT LEAST 230, TO MATCH 270 BY 2005. OKAY. 2025. WHY IS THAT? THE BABY BOOMERS ARE LEAVING TEACHING. NO ONE IS WILLING TO GO INTO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM BECAUSE THE SALARY IS SO LOW SO, IF YOU DID BUT I SUGGESTED YOU COULD RAISE SALARIES TO MAKE THEM COMPETITIVE AND AFTER TEN YEARS YOU'D BE MAKING 60,000 DOLLARS A YEAR AS A TEACHER, NUMBER ONE, AND NUMBER TWO IT WOULD DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS. YOU KNOW HOW MANY SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST WE HAVE? NOW WE HAVE ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST FOR EVERY 1500 KIDS. 1570 KIDS. ALL OF THE EXPERTS SAY IT SHOULD BE DOWN CLOSE TO ONE TO 500, OR THE HIGHEST, ONE TO 700. WE DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL NURSES IN OUR SCHOOLS. NUMBER THREE, WE WOULD DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN OUR SCHOOLS TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT COME FROM HOME BUT HERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, EVERY SINGLE CHILD AGED THREE, FOUR AND FIVE WOULD GO TO SCHOOL. NOT DAYCARE, SCHOOL. NORMAL SCHOOL. NO, EVERYONE IN UNIVERSITIES IN NEIGHBORING STATES, NEBRASKA POINT OUT AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THIS IS ALL DOWN IN THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OF STUDY, IF IN FACT YOU HAD SOMEONE GOING TO SCHOOL NO MATTER WHAT THEIR BACKGROUND, NO MATTER HOW POOR THE FAMILY WAS,, STARTING AT AGE THREE, YOU INCREASE BY OVER 55% CHANCE THAT THEY WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF HIGH SCHOOL, THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND MAYBE BEYOND WITHOUT GETTING ANY TROUBLE. WHY IS IT NOT EVERYBODY'S INTEREST? EVERYBODY'S INTEREST? SUPER WEALTHY PEOPLE'S INTEREST, POOR FOLKS INTEREST, THAT WE HAVE KIDS BEING ABLE TO WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH AND LEARN AS MUCH, AND LAST THING IN THESE TITLE I SCHOOLS, AS REQUIRED WHEN WE GET THIS PASSED IS WE PROVIDE ADVANCED PLACEMENT COURSES, WELL, WE STARTED WITH THE PREJUDICE THAT A KID COMING OUT OF A VERY POOR FAMILY AND THAT SMART CAN'T DO THAT WELL. GUESS, WHAT IF THEY ARE EXPOSED STARTING AT AGE THREE TO A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER VOCABULARY, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INFORMATION THAN THAT, THEY CAN DO ANYTHING ANY OTHER KID CAN DO AND SO WE SHOULD PROVIDE FOR ADVANCED PLACEMENT COURSES FOR THOSE WHO WANT THOSE COURSES. THERE'S SO MUCH WE CAN DO AND THAT COST ANOTHER 30 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR, WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE SPENDING ON THINGS THAT DON'T MATTER. IF WE'RE ABLE TO GIVE A TAX BREAK FOR RESOURCES, WHY CAN'T WE GIVE A TAX BREAK FOR , ANYWAY. SO, I'M BREAKING MY RULE. MY STAFF I, COULD SEE LOOKS ON THEIR FACES. THE PLANE IS LEAVING, JOE, YOU KNOW, BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU. THE ONLY POINT I WANT TO MAKE, FOLKS, THERE IS NO REASON, I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES TODAY THAN I EVER WAS. I'LL DO IT WHEN WE FINISH, OKAY? THAT WILL STICK AROUND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AND SHAKE HANDS BUT THINK ABOUT IT. WE HAVE BETTER POSITION THAN ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. OUR WORKERS ARE LIBERAL THREE TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS WORKERS IN ASIA. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN AMERICA THEN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED AND EVERY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN SOCIETY HAS COME OUT OF THIS RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES A YOU OWN THEM. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON THEM. THEY GET MONETIZED BY CORPORATIONS, WHICH IS, OKAY BUT YOU OWN THEM. WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE THE WEALTHIEST NATION IN HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND WE HAVE , IF WE INVEST IN OURSELVES AGAIN, WE WILL REMAIN. THAT WE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE WORLD, AND IT IS BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE THAT IS A LOT HAS TO LEAD THE WORLD. IN ADDITION TO, THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION THAT EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD IS LOOKING HOPING AND PRAYING TO GOD WE WILL COME BACK BECAUSE I, SAID THE WORLD IS NOT SO GALVANIZING AND IF WE DON'T ORGANIZE, IT IF I GUYS WILL. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANKS SO MUCH. I LOVE THE IDEA AS AN EDUCATOR 50 YEARS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO TEACHERS IN THE WHITE HOUSE COME THE END OF THIS ELECTION. I WANT TO TALK TO THE ISLANDS IN THE ROOM FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES. WE HAVE A PRETTY IMPORTANT DECISION TO MAKE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE SIGNED A COMMITTEE CAUCUS CARD FOR JOE BIDEN AND WHY MY HUSBAND, FORMER GOVERNOR AND SECRETARY, HAS SIGNED A CARD AS WELL. HE WOULD LOVE TO BE HERE TONIGHT BUT HE WILL BE WITH US TOMORROW, BUT I AM SPEAKING FOR BOTH OF US. WE HAVE KNOWN JOE AND JOE BIDEN FOR 33 YEARS. WE TRUST THEM AS MUCH TODAY AS WE DID 33 YEARS AGO. WE WERE ROCK-SOLID, THEN THEY ARE ROCK-SOLID NOW, AND THAT IS WHY WE BOTH , WILL STAND NEXT TO , IN THE IOWA CAUCUS. I ASKED MYSELF WHAT I WANT FROM THE SELECTION AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET UP ANY , EVERY MORNING AS AN EDUCATOR COMMUNITY VOLUNTEER AND GO ABOUT MY WORK KNOWING THAT THE PERSON WHO IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND HIS STAFF HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THE DOMESTIC FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES THAT WILL FACE US IN THE YEARS TO COME. THAT EXPERIENCE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME AND I ALSO WANT TO GET EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WITH CONGRESS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, WITH FOREIGN LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD TO SOLVE THE DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES THAT WILL FACE US AND I WANT TO GET UP EVERY MORNING KNOWING THAT I CAN AND BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES INTO MY CLASSROOM OR DO MY GRANDCHILDREN CLASSROOM AND THEY WOULD BE PROUD TO HAVE THEM THERE AND HE WOULD REPRESENT THE VALUES THAT WE CARE ABOUT AS AMERICANS. DORIS CURRENTS GOODWIN WHO WAS A SCHOLAR PRESIDENT SAYS THE TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS AND GOOD PRESIDENTS ARE RESILIENCE AND COMPASSION. JOE BIDEN HAS BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. TOM AND I LOST OUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND OF COURSE, ALL OF, YOU MANY OF YOU REACHED OUT TO US BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR OUR FAMILY. JOE AND JOE BIDEN REACHED OUT TO US, TO OUR SON AND DAUGHTER IN LAW, TO OUR EXTENDED FAMILY, AND I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THAT HE AND EVERY SHOE AS WELL, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GO INTO A ROOM LIKE THIS AND I'VE BEEN A LOT OF THEM WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT POLITICIANS, YOU CAN'T GO INTO A ROOM WITH JOE BIDEN WHERE HE ISN'T STANDING SOMEPLACE TALKING TO SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN SUFFERING AND SHOWING THE COMPASSION THAT HE IS SO WELL-KNOWN FOR. I WANT A PRESIDENT WHO HAVE SUFFERED, AND HE CERTAINLY KNOWS WHAT IS LIKE TO SEND A CHILD OFF TO WAR, THE, MILITARY HE KNOWS WHAT IT LIKE TO HAVE LOST A VERY BELOVED FAMILY MEMBER, AND YOU CAN GO TO A SITUATION ANY PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY INCOME FOR PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED LAW SO AS I WENT ABOUT THINKING ABOUT THIS DECISION THAT I HAVE TO MAKE, I STARTED THINKING ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL WITH, PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE FROM HERE, TO GET THERE. I THOUGHT OF IT ALL THE CHILDREN, THE EIGHT CRITICIZE HOT FOR OVER 20 YEARS. I THOUGHT ABOUT THE STUDENTS AT THE SMALL COLLEGE IN MOUNT PLEASANT. I THOUGHT ABOUT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GONNA SHOW UP THE CAUCUS, MAY VOTE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION BECAUSE I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING A CANDIDATE THAT THEY CAN VOTE FOR IN NOVEMBER. SO, WHERE I COME, FROM IF I DID NOT HAVE REPUBLICAN FRIENDS I WOULD NOT HAVE ANY FRIENDS IT ALSO I TRY TO THINK OF WHO IS MY FAVORITE REPUBLICAN, WE ARE MY FAVORITE INDEPENDENTS, WHO ARE THE PEOPLE LIVE COPY FOR THAT I CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T AGREE POLITICALLY AND WHAT CANDIDATE IS GOING TO BE BEST NOT ONLY TO BE DONALD TRUMP BUT WILL PROVIDE A PERSON THAT THEY COULD ACCEPT AND THEY COULD WALK INTO THE VOTING BOOTHS NO VOTE FOR SO, WHEN WE WERE TALKING A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO TALKING TO FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND I NOTICE THE MY BEST FRIEND GROWING UP WAS IN THE BACK ROW, AND SHE IS A LIFELONG REPUBLICAN, AS IS HER HUSBAND AND SHE CAME UP AFTERWARDS SHE SAID, I'M THAT PERSON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I CAN'T VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP, BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME SOMEBODY THAT I CAN VOTE FOR, SOMEBODY WHO IS A MODERATE, WHO WILL APPEAL ACROSS PARTY LINES AND IN, FACT EVERY ROOM I'VE BEEN IN SAYS THAT WHEN IT IS OVER AND WALKING THE LINE AND TALKING TO, PEOPLE SOMEBODY IN THIS AUDIENCE IS ONE OF THOSE AS WELL. I JUST MET A FORMER LEGISLATOR WHO SPOKE WITH TOM, WHO SERVED WITH TOM ON THE LEGISLATURE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WHO SAYS HE WILL CAUCUS FOR JOE BIDEN ON MONDAY SO I HOPE THAT YOU AS WELL PUT ON YOUR PRACTICAL IOWA HATS AND THINK ABOUT WHO IS THAT PERSON WHO IS GOING TO APPEAL THE MOST PEOPLE, BECAUSE TOM AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT PERSON IS JOE BIDEN AND WE HOPE YOU WILL JOIN US AND TALKING FOR HIM ON MONDAY AND VOTING FOR HIM IN NOVEMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SANTA CAUCUS CARD. PLEASE SIGN A CAUCUS CARD. COME ON MONDAY.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?468675-1\/joe-biden-campaign-event-council-bluffs-iowa","Summary":"Former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, campaigned in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY. I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE OUT THERE THAT IS BEING TRUTHFUL AND HONEST. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT GIVING EVERYBODY FREE THIS AND FREE THAT. IN IOWA, THERE IS NOTHING FREE. YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR EVERYTHING YOU GET. IT IS TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REALIZED THAT. AND THE SCHAMA POLITICS THE DEMOCRATS ARE PLAYING ON MY THINK IT HURTS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. IT IS GREAT TO BE JOINED BY THEM AND TO KNOW THAT THEY ALSO HAVE THE BACK OF OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT, BEFORE I INTRODUCE HIM, I JUST WANT TO FIRST OF ALL SAY THANK YOU. IT IS AN HONOR TO GET TO BE YOUR CONGRESSWOMAN AND BE ONE OF THE FIRST CONGRESSWOMEN EVER ELECTED FROM THE STATE OF IOWA, ALONG WITH CINDY IN IOWA THREE. IT IS MY DISTINCT HONOR EVERY SINGLE DAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT, AND I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH. IT IS ALSO IN HONOR OF MIND TO GET TO ENDORSE AND SUPPORT AND CAUCUS ON MONDAY NIGHT FOR JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU SEE, TO KNOW WHY THAT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR ME, YOU GUYS HAVE TO KNOW WHERE I'M COMING FROM. SOME OF YOU DO. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE WAY I GREW UP HERE IN IOWA, THAT THIS MAN HAS MY SUPPORT. YOU SEE, I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN A LITTLE BIT NORTH OF DUBUQUE. IT HAS MORE COWS THAN PEOPLE. MY DAD WAS A UNION PIPEFITTER WELDER. MY MOM WAS A SCHOOL SECRETARY. THERE WERE FOUR KIDS AND MY FAMILY, AND WE WERE ALL FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE GRADUATES. [APPLAUSE] GROWING UP HERE IN IOWA AND IN THIS COUNTRY, WE WERE NEVER PROMISED IT WAS GOING TO BE EASY , BUT WE WERE PROMISED THAT IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU CAN MAKE IT. THAT IS WHAT WE WERE TOLD, AND THAT IS WHAT WE WERE PROMISED, AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR AND WHAT WE KNOW JOE BIDEN, AS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, WILL THINK ABOUT EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THAT WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE FIRST TIME I MET THE VICE PRESIDENT, IT WAS BECAUSE OF MY GRANDFATHER, WHO WAS A FIREFIGHTER. MY GRANDFATHER WAS A GUY WHO I LOOKED UP TO MY WHOLE LIFE. ONE DAY, IN 2007, I HAD BEEN HAPPY TO WORK DOWN AT THE STATEHOUSE AS A PAGE AT THE TIME. I WAS AN 18-YEAR-OLD. YOU GUYS REMEMBER 2007, WHEN WE HAD A LOT OF CANDIDATES RUNNING, BUT I DID NOT KNOW EVERYBODY IN THE RACE AND ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I DID NOT KNOW WHY MY GRANDFATHER WAS CALLING ME AND TELLING ME I HAD TO GO LISTEN TO THIS SENATOR FROM DELAWARE. HE TOLD ME, I'M TELLING YOU, THIS JOE BIDEN, HE GETS IT. HE UNDERSTANDS OUR FAMILY, AND YOU'VE GOT TO GO LISTEN TO HIM. I SAID ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO, PAPA. THERE I GO, INTO THIS ROOM, THE IOWA CAUCUS ROOM. BOB, I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN THERE THAT DAY. I GO INTO THIS IOWA CAUCUS ROOM, AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I DID NOT KNOW WHO JOE BIDEN WAS WHEN HE WALKED IN, BUT I SURE AS HECK NEW WHO HE WAS WHEN HE WALKED OUT. [APPLAUSE] HE'S THE GUY THAT UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS LIKE AND WHAT IT MEANT FOR ME TO HAVE GROWN UP IN IOWA AS A 10-YEAR-OLD WHO HAD TO HAVE HER DAD'S BUSINESS AGENTS NAME MEMORIZED, BECAUSE WHEN THAT NAME SHOWED UP ON CALLER ID, IT MEANT MY DAD HAD A JOB. HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT MEANT FOR FAMILIES WHEN THAT NAME WAS NOT SHOWING UP VERY OFTEN, AND WHAT THAT MEANT FOR KITCHEN TABLES AROUND THE STATE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY. HE ALSO KNEW AND UNDERSTOOD THE DIGNITY OF WORK, LIKE MY DAD, WHO HAD WORKED 16 HOUR SHIFTS AND WOULD GET HOME AND LITERALLY WRING THE SWEAT OUT OF HIS BELT. HE KNEW WHAT IT MEANT FOR MY FAMILY. HE UNDERSTOOD IT AND FOUGHT FOR FOLKS WHO GREW UP JUST LIKE ME, JUST LIKE US HIS ENTIRE CAREER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE OTHER THING THAT HE KNEW WAS PUBLIC SERVICE AND THE DIGNITY AND DECENCY OF PUBLIC SERVICE. YOU SEE, JOE BIDEN REMINDS ME A LOT OF MY GRANDFATHER IN WAYS IN TERMS OF WHAT HE KNOWS ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE. TO ME, MY GRANDFATHER WAS THE GUY WHO TAUGHT ME ALL ABOUT IT. HE WAS A FIREFIGHTER, AND FOR ME, OUR FIREFIGHTERS ARE SOME OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF WHAT PUBLIC SERVICE ACTUALLY MEANS MAMA BECAUSE , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE WHEN MY GRANDFATHER WOULD GET A CALL TO RUN INTO A BURNING BUILDING, HE DID NOT CALL BACK AND ASKED, WHAT COLOR IS YOUR SKIN, HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU MAKE, WHERE YOU FROM, WHO DO YOU LOVE, WHAT'S YOUR RELIGION? HE JUST SHOWED UP AND HELPED PEOPLE AND DID HIS JOB. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S THE KIND OF JOB WE HAVE SEEN FROM VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. THAT IS THE KIND OF JOB WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SEE RIGHT NOW IN THAT WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] ALL THOSE REASONS ARE WHY I DECIDED TO SUPPORT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT IT BECAME EVEN MORE CLEAR WHY HE HAS MY SUPPORT THREE WEEKS AGO, AFTER I ENDORSED. WE GOT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER ON A BUS. WHEN YOU ARE GETTING AROUND IOWA, YOU GUYS KNOW YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRAVELING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER, SO WE HAD A WHOLE LOT OF TIME TO CATCH UP. ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY , WE REALLY CONNECTED ON, THE FACT THAT WE WERE ELECTED TO FEDERAL OFFICE AT THE AGE OF 29. I KNOW IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY. I WAS ONE OF THE YOUNGEST WOMEN EVER ELECTED TO CONGRESS, AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE WORK OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. WHAT THAT MUST HAVE MEANT FOR JOE BIDEN ALSO TO HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO THE U.S. SENATE AT 29. WE TALKED ABOUT YES, WHEN YOU GET ELECTED AT A YOUNG AGE, YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT RIGHT. YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO LEARN ON THE JOB. MAKE SURE YOU HIRE THE RIGHT PEOPLE, GET TO WORK RIGHT AWAY, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, THEY WILL QUESTION. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT, BUT ALSO, AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT, IT HIT, MY GOSH, NOT ONLY WAS HE ELECTED TO FEDERAL OFFICE AT 29, YOUNGER THAN I AM STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW, BUT HE ALSO AT THAT TIME SUFFERED ONE OF THE WORST TRAGEDIES MOST OF US CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE. AT THE AGE OF 29, AFTER GETTING ELECTED, HE LOST HIS WIFE AND HIS BABY DAUGHTER AND HIS SON, CRITICALLY INJURED. I THINK WHAT THAT MUST HAVE MEANT FOR HIM TO TAKE THAT OATH, THE SAME OATH I TOOK, RAISING YOUR HAND, PLEDGING TO FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION, WHAT THAT MUST HAVE MEANT, STANDING IN THAT HOSPITAL ROOM WITH HIS TWO BOYS, KNOWING THAT HE WAS GOING TO GET ON A TRAIN EVERY NIGHT TO GO BACK AND FORTH, THAT HE DID NOT DO THIS AND DID NOT GO INTO PUBLIC SERVICE BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS FANCY OR HE WAS GOING TO BECOME SOME CELEBRITY. HE DID IT AFTER EVERYTHING HE HAD BEEN THROUGH, KNOWING THAT HIS COUNTRY DID NOT OWN HIM ANYTHING, BUT HE STILL OWED SOMETHING TO HIS COUNTRY, TO HIS COMMUNITY, AND TO HIS FAMILY. HE TOOK THAT OATH WITH EYES WIDE OPEN. THAT'S THE CHARACTER, THOSE ARE THE VALUES, THAT THIS CURRENT PRESIDENT CAN'T CONTEND WITH AND IS TERRIFIED TO FACE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE JOE BIDEN AND THAT CHARACTER AND THOSE VALUES ARE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET. THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE DEPENDS ON IT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT THAT LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP SO THAT WE CAN WIN BACK THAT STATEHOUSE, SO THAT WE CAN TAKE BACK THE U.S. SENATE SEAT, AND THAT WE CAN KEEP THIS SEAT BLUE AND TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I PROMISE YOU, IF YOU WORK WITH ME HERE, YOU GET OUT THERE ON MONDAY NIGHT LIKE I'M GOING TO GET OUT THERE, YOU MAKE SURE YOU BRING YOUR FRIENDS, YOU BRING YOUR NEIGHBORS, YOU BRING YOUR SISTERS AND BROTHERS, YOUR GRANDKIDS, I DON'T CARE WHO YOU BRING, BUT GET OUT THERE AND CAUCUS, BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS WATCHING. WE NEED YOU TO DO THAT JOB ON MONDAY NIGHT. I PROMISE I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO WHATEVER I CAN, BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, IOWA IS MY HOME, AND THIS IS OUR COUNTRY. AND WE NEED JOE BIDEN, HIS CHARACTER, AND HIS VALUES TO TAKE IT BACK. THANK YOU. [VIDEO CLIP] IT'S SAID AND HEAR YOUR CHARACTER IS REVEALED. , IN HERE YOUR CHARACTER IS REVEALED. WE SIDE WITH OBAMA, WE SEE IT WITH TROUT, BUT IT IS IN LIFE WHAT YOUR CHARACTER IS FOR, WHERE YOU ARE FROM, WHO YOU GREW UP WITH, AND WHO YOU LOVE. HOW YOU HAVE BEEN TESTED. WHAT YOU'VE OVERCOME. HOW YOU STEP UP, AND WHAT YOU DO WHEN THE CAMERAS ARE OFF. WHERE YOU'VE LED. WHAT YOU'VE DONE. AND WHAT YOU WILL NEVER STOP WORKING TO DO. WHO YOU STAND WITH, AND WHO YOU FIGHT FOR. CHARACTER MATTERS. MAYBE MORE HERE THAN ANYWHERE. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN! (music) (music) VICE PRES. BIDEN: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO BE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU ARE MAKING ME A HERO IN FRONT OF MY FOUR GRANDDAUGHTERS. THESE ARE THE LOVES OF MY LIFE. THIS IS MY NUMBER THREE GRANDDAUGHTER, MAISIE, A FRESHMAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. SHE WAS TO TEAM ALL STATE AND HIGH SCHOOL, WONDERED WHETHER SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE SCHOLARSHIP OFFERS BECAUSE SHE SAID, I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY UNTIL I KNOW I CAN DO THE WORK. SHE REALLY DISAPPOINTED , SHE ONLY GOT A 3.9. GOD LOVE HER. THIS IS MY NUMBER TWO GRANDDAUGHTER, FINNEGAN BIDEN. I COLOR MY SECRET WEAPON. , CALL HER MY SECRET WEAPON. SHE HAS BEEN COMPETING WITH ME FOR A LONG TIME. SHE'S A JUNIOR, AN HONORS STUDENT. SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT ME. THIS IS BEAU BIDEN'S DAUGHTER. SHE'S ONLY IN NINTH GRADE. THE REASON I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE I WANT SECRET SERVICE AGAIN, SO THEY TRAVEL WITH HER WHEREVER SHE GOES. [LAUGHTER] VICE PRES. BIDEN: AND THIS IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE AND THE LIFE OF MY LOVE. THIS IS MY OLDEST GRANDDAUGHTER, NAMED AFTER MY DECEASED DAUGHTER NAOMI. SHE IS A SENIOR AT COLUMBIA HIGH SCHOOL, AND SHE IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF HER POP AT HIS OLD AGE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. BIDEN: HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. THAT'S VERY NICE. YOU ARE CHARLOTTE? HOW OLD ARE YOU? SEVEN YEARS OLD. CHARLOTTE THREW ME A BEAUTIFUL SIGN THAT SAYS \"GO JOE BIDEN.\" THANK YOU, BABY. I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. BIDEN: FUTURE PRESIDENT. I'LL VOTE FOR YOU. I'LL REMEMBER YOU WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT AND THEY SAY THERE IS AN OLD GUY OUTSIDE NAMED JOE BIDEN WHO USED TO BE PRESIDENT, PROMISE YOU WON'T SAY JOE WHO, OK? WILL YOU HOLD THIS FOR ME? THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU, HONEY. IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO BE BACK IN WATERLOO. I WANT TO START BY THANKING BOB, YOUR REPRESENTATIVE, FOR ENDORSING ME. THERE'S BOB RIGHT HERE. BOB ENDORSED ME, WHICH IS A BIG DEAL, FRANKLY. HE SAID, WHEN I ENDORSE YOU, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO, RIGHT? I SAID YEAH, WIN. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A LOT OF ROADS AND BRIDGES WHEN WE GET THIS DONE. AND KRISTI BILL SACK HAS BECOME A GREAT FRIEND, AND I REALLY MEAN IT. SHE HAS TRAVELED ALL OVER THE STATE FOR ME. WE PROBABLY PUT IN WELL OVER A THOUSAND MILES AROUND THE STATE AND HAVE BEEN TO ABOUT 23 COUNTIES WITH ME, HELPING ME OUT. TOM AND I HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON. WE HAVE WIVES THAT ARE BETTER LOOKING AND SMARTER THAN WE ARE. TOM, THANK YOU, PAL. TOM HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE IN HIS SUPPORT ME. , HIS SUPPORT FOR ME. I WILL JUST SAY THIS, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT WOULD GIVE ME SOME SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITIES, FROM TAKING CARE OF THE RECOVERY ACT, WHICH WAS OVER $900 BILLION, AND HE GAVE ME PRESIDENTIAL POWERS WHEN I DID IT. HE HAD MANY OTHER THINGS HE HAD TO DO, WHETHER I WAS DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN AT OUR BORDER AND GOING DOWN TO CENTRAL AMERICA TO TRY TO WORK THINGS OUT, ETC. BUT I WAS ABLE TO TASK ANYBODY IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO HELP ME. ALTHOUGH TOM WAS SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE , THAT'S A GOOD KID, I LIKE THAT , [LAUGHTER] VICE PRES. BIDEN: ALTHOUGH HE WAS SEC. OF AGRICULTURE, ON ALMOST EVERY SINGLE THING I NEEDED HELP ON, I WENT TO TOM. TOM, THANK YOU FOR BEING SUCH A GOOD FRIEND, AND I REALLY MEAN IT. TOM IS ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST GUYS I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH. HE DOES SO MUCH. IT WAS THE SINGLE BEST DECISION THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE IN TERMS OF A CABINET. THANK YOU, TOM. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. BIDEN: I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PRESIDENT FINKENAUER REMEMBERS ME WHEN SHE'S PRESIDENT. TALK ABOUT TALENT. YOU HAVE ELECTED TWO OF THE YOUNGEST WOMEN TO CONGRESS FROM THIS STATE IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, INCLUDING NOT JUST ABBY, BUT ASHLEY MIGHT YOU HAVE JUST DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB , NOT JUST ABBY, BUT , YOU HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. ABBY HAS BEEN WITH ME ALL OVER THE STATE AND IS A GREAT FRIEND AND A GREAT ASSET. SHE WAS PART OF THE REASON WHY WE TOOK BACK THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ALONG WITH CONGRESSWOMAN AXNE. WE HAVE A TALENTED GROUP OF MEMBERS IN THE NEWLY ELECTED 201819 THAT WE HAVE HAD. I HAVE CAMPAIGN FOR A LOT OF CANDIDATES IN MY CAREER, BUT I CAN SAY WITHOUT CONTRADICTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MORE TALENTED CLASS OF CANDIDATES I HAVE WORKED FOR THAN THE CLASS THAT GOT ELECTED IN 2018. 37 OF THE PEOPLE I WENT OUT WITH WHERE WOMEN, AND THEY ARE REALLY GOOD. FULKS, I WANT TO , FOLKS, I WANT TO THANK THEM ALL FOR BEING A PART OF THE TEAM AND HELPING CARRY ME ALONG HERE. FOLKS, EVERY FOUR YEARS, DEMOCRACY BEGINS HERE IN IOWA. YOU SET IN MOTION A NATION. IT IS ALWAYS A BIG RESPONSE ABILITY, BUT IT IS ALWAYS A BIGGER RESPONSIBILITY THAN ANY TIME ANY OF YOU PARTICIPATED. IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M RUNNING MORE BECAUSE ANYBODY ELSE IS RUNNING. IT'S BECAUSE OF WHO IS PRESIDENT. AND WE OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT HE IS KNOWN ON JANUARY 20, 2021 AS FORMER PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I REALLY DO BELIEVE THIS YEAR THAT THE CHARACTER OF THE NATION IS ON THE BALLOT. THE CHARACTER OF THE CANDIDATES IS ON THE BALLOT. I WROTE AN ARTICLE, WHAT GOT ME INTO THE RACE, IN 2017 WHEN THOSE FOLKS CAME OUT OF THE FIELDS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAW ON TELEVISION. CARRYING TORCHES, COMING OUT OF THE FIELD, THEIR VEINS BULGING. SCREAMING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT WAS SCREAMED AND HOLLERED IN GERMANY IN THE 30'S, ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN AND WHITE SUPREMACISTS. A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS RESISTING THIS HATE WAS KILLED. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, DONALD TRUMP, WAS ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE CONFLICT. REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE THAT. I WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR ATLANTIC MAGAZINE THAT THE TIME SAYING THAT THE SOUL OF THE NATION IS AT RISK, AND I MEANT IT. WASN'T HYPERBOLE. IT'S THE REASON I FINALLY DECIDED TO RUN. MY GRANDDAUGHTERS LATER CAME TO ME, NOT A JOKE, AND SUGGESTED THAT I HAD TO RUN. I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE AN UGLY CAMPAIGN. DIDN'T WANT THEM TO BE CAUGHT UP IN IT. THEY CAME TO SEE ME. WE HAVE A TRADITION. YOU CAN ASK FOR A FAMILY MEETING, AND IT IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY. IF ANY KID ASKS FOR A FAMILY MEETING. I GOT A CALL FROM NAOMI. THE ONLY ONE MISSING IS MY GRANDSON, HE IS IN EIGHTH GRADE. THEY CAME AND SAID I HAD TO RUN. IT'S GOING TO BE BAD, BUT WE HAVE TO RUN. THEIR WHOLE LIFE, THE FATHER HAS BEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL, GRANDFATHER U.S. SENATOR, VICE PRESIDENT. THEY KNOW THE UPS AND DOWNS THAT GO WITH THAT. I COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID. I THINK HARD ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT AND WHAT HE HAS DONE AND NOT DONE. JUST IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. A LITTLE LONGER THAN THAT. WE LEARNED THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE U.S. MILITARY, DONALD TRUMP, MET WITH OUR FLAG OFFICERS AND GENERALS IN THE PENTAGON, AND TO THEIR FACE, CALLED THEM \"LOSERS, DOPES, AND BABIES. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S EVER BEEN A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO HAS TALKED TO OUR WARRIORS THAT WAY EVER. THEN WHEN HE GOT OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, I AND MANY OTHERS PREDICTED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THERE WOULD BE CONFLICT. INSTEAD OF AMERICA FIRST, IT BECAME AMERICA ALONE. OUR ALLIES WALKED AWAY, ENDED UP IN A CONFLICT THAT THINK GOD HAS NOT GONE BEYOND WHAT IT DID. REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED? YOU HAD THE IRANIANS SENDING MISSILES INTO THE AIR FORCE WHERE MY SON HAD BEEN IN IRAQ. IT TURNS OUT 64 OF THOSE WARRIORS ARE SUFFERING FROM TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT SAY WHEN HE FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT? THAT IT'S NOT SERIOUS, JUST HEADACHES. THIS MAN DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THESE WARRIORS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IF MY SON WAS STILL THERE. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS BEYOND THE PALE. THIS IS MORE THAN JUST WHETHER OR NOT I AGREE OR DON'T AGREE WITH HIS POLICIES. ALL KIDDING ASIDE. CAN ANYBODY THINK OF ANY PRESIDENT WHO HAS EVER COME CLOSE TO THIS? OUR TROOPS DESERVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, NOT SOMEONE WHO BELITTLES THEM, BERATES THEM, AND DOESN'T SUPPORT THEM. TO STATE THE OBVIOUS, THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL INHERIT A COUNTRY DIVIDED AND A WORLD IN DISARRAY. AND THERE IS NO TIME FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS READY ON DAY ONE WHO CAN TAKE COMMAND OF OUR FORCES, WHO CAN REPAIR OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR ALLIES AND ONCE MORE MAKE THE U.S. THE ENVY AND LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] I REALLY MEAN THIS. I KNOW WHAT YOU ALL THOUGHT. I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD GET THIS BAD. I REALLY DIDN'T. I HAD NO EXPECTATIONS. I'M NOT BEING A WISE GUY. I'M BEING DEADLY EARNEST. REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID RIGHT AFTER HE WAS ELECTED? THIS IS HARDER THAN WRITING A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE. BLESS ME, FATHER. SERIOUSLY. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. I SAID THIS MUST BE A JOKE. TURNS OUT IT IS A DIFFERENT JOKE. WE HAVE SO MUCH WE HAVE TO DO. THE MIDDLE CLASS IS GETTING CRUSHED. I COME FROM FAMILIES JUST LIKE YOU DID. THREE BEDROOM SPLIT LIVER HOME , SPLIT LEVEL HOME, FOR KIDS. DAD TOOK THREE YEARS AFTER HE MOVED FROM SCRANTON TO FIND A JOB SO HE CAN BUY A HOUSE. WE WEREN'T POOR, BUT WE LIVED PAYCHECK-TO-PAYCHECK. MY DAD STILL BELIEVED ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE. HE GOT ALL FOUR OF HIS KIDS TO COLLEGE. HE ALWAYS BELIEVED EVERYONE HAD A RIGHT TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. YOU KNOW WHAT? THE MIDDLE CLASS TODAY IS GETTING CRUSHED. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE-CLASS IN THE WORLD. AND THE MIDDLE CLASS, OVER HALF OF THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS, THINK OF THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER LIVE TO HAVE THE SAME STANDARD OF LIVING THEY HAVE. THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN A LIFETIME OF ANYONE IN THIS ROOM, EVEN IF YOU ARE 100 YEARS OLD. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED BEFORE. AS , WE HAVE TO REBUILD IT. THE MIDDLE CLASS WASN'T BUILT BY WALL STREET BANKERS AND CEOS, IT WAS BUILT I ORDINARY MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. GUESS WHO BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS? UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S HOW IT GOT THERE. THIS ISN'T HYPERBOLE, THIS IS A FACT. THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENED. THAT HAPPENED BEFORE. THIS TIME, YOU HAVE TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG, BLACK, BROWN, THOSE WITH DISABILITIES, GAY, STRAIGHT, EVERYBODY HAS TO GET A CHANCE TO COME ALONG. BECAUSE IT IS WHO WE ARE, IT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN BRING US TOGETHER, A LEADER WHO NOT ONLY CAN UNITE OUR PARTY, WHICH HAS TO BE DONE, BUT UNITE THE COUNTRY. WE'RE A DEMOCRACY. NO DEMOCRACY CAN BE SUSTAINED WITHOUT CONSENSUS. YOU HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. NOT JUST DEMOCRATS, NOT JUST INDEPENDENTS, BUT REPUBLICANS, AS WELL. A DEMOCRACY CAN'T FUNCTION WITHOUT A CONSENSUS. OTHERWISE, THE ONLY THING THAT HAPPENS IS THE ABUSE OF POWER. ONE BRANCH CLAIMING POWER THAT IS BEYOND THEIR CAPACITY, BEYOND WHAT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY ELIGIBLE. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN THE U.S. SENATE, I WAS PROUD TO SERVE IN THAT ORGANIZATION. IT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST HONORS OF MY LIFE READ BUT FOLKS, IT IS NOT THE CONGRESS I KNOW AND NOT THE SENATE I KNOW. YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS SAYING WHAT HE COMMITTED IS IMPEACHABLE, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DIVIDE THE COUNTRY MORE, SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT. OR YES, WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG, BUT IT DOESN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF BEING THROWN OUT OF OFFICE. I FIND THAT KIND OF FASCINATING. THE FACT IS THAT GEORGE WASHINGTON HAS ROLLED OVER IN HIS GRAVE. THE PHRASE I WANT TO READ TO YOU, GEORGE WASHINGTON IN HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS SAID \"AGAINST THE INSIDIOUS WILES OF FOREIGN INFLUENCE, THE JEALOUSY OF A FREE PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE CONSTANTLY AWAKE, SINCE HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE PROVE THAT FOREIGN INFLUENCE IS ONE OF THE MOST BANEFUL FOES A REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT.\" GEORGE WASHINGTON WARNED US AGAINST PEOPLE LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP. SO WHAT DOES THIS SAY? IT SAYS DONALD TRUMP IS A LOT LESS GEORGE WASHINGTON THAN HE IS GEORGE WALLACE, THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS. AND FOLKS, I FOUND IT FASCINATING. WHEN I TALK ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER, , AND IF THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE THAT I'M RUNNING THE NOMINATION WITH, SEEKING THE NOMINATION, THEY SAY JOE USED TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE PEOPLE TOGETHER, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, GIVE CONSENSUS, AND PAST OF THE VAC , VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, MADE SURE WE HAD THE RECOVERY ACT BY CONVINCING REPUBLICANS TO JOIN, $900 BILLION SPENT, LESS THAN .2% ACCORDING TO THE STUDIES. THEY WERE THE OLD DAYS. THREE YEARS AGO. AND THEY SAY , I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY. I KNOW THIS NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY BETTER THAN ANYBODY. ME AND MY FAMILY HAVE IN THE OBJECT OF THEIR ATTENTION FOR THREE YEARS. AN OBJECT OF THEIR AFFECTION. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PEOPLE HAVE SPENT OVER $12 MILLION TO $15 MILLION RUNNING NEGATIVE ADS AGAINST ME. THE VAST MAJORITY OF MAINSTREAM MEDIA WON'T EVEN CARRY THE ADS, BECAUSE THEY ARE FLAT OUT LIES. I WAS TOLD THERE WERE OVER 60, MAYBE IT WAS 80, I SAW IT IN A NEWS CLIP, REPUBLICANS COMING OUT TO THE CAUCUSES TO DETERMINE WHO WAS GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE. SOMEONE WAS PROBABLY GOING TO STAND UP. THE LAST THREE EVENTS WE DID, SOMEONE FROM THAT GROUP STOOD UP AND STARTED TO SHOUT SOMETHING. IT MAY HAPPEN BEFORE IT'S OVER. AND IT IS KIND OF AMAZING. DID YOU HEAR WHAT YOUR SENATOR SAID, JONI ERNST? \"IOWA CAUCUSES ARE THIS NEXT MONDAY, I'M REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THIS DISCUSSION TODAY , WHERE THERE WERE GOING AFTER ME IN THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE WITH LIES, \"THIS DECISION INFORMS AND INFLUENCES IOWA CAUCUS VOTERS. WILL THEY STILL SUPPORT JOE BIDEN AT THIS POINT.\" [APPLAUSE] GOT TO GIVE HER CREDIT, SHE IS REALLY SUBTLE, ISN'T SHE? JUST READ THE WASHINGTON POST HEADLINE. IT SAID \"TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS JOIN FORCES TO ATTACK BIDEN AHEAD OF THE IOWA CAUCUSES.\" PRETTY SIMPLE. I WONDER WHY THEY DON'T WANT ME TO BE THE NOMINEE. I WONDER WHY HE'S SO CONCERNED. SHE KNOWS IF I'M THE NOMINEE, I WILL BEAT HIM LIKE A DRUM. [APPLAUSE] I THINK WITH THIS SAYS ABOUT THE THREAT TO THE NATION THAT EXISTS. CAN YOU EVER THINK OF A TIME, NOT ONLY IN THE CAUCUS HISTORY, BUT RECENT AMERICAN HISTORY, THE LAST 57-80 YEARS, WHERE A SITTING PRESIDENT HAS SPENT SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY TRYING TO PREVENT SOMEONE FROM THE OTHER PARTY TRYING TO BECOME A NOMINEE. THERE MAY BE A TIME, I CAN'T THINK OF ANY TIME. A PRESIDENT DECIDING HE WANTS TO PICK WHO THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WILL BE, OR AT LEAST WHO IT WON'T BE. NO MATTER HOW PERSONAL THE ATTACKS ARE ON ME AND MY SURVIVING SON, MY FAMILY AS A WHOLE, I CAN'T AFFORD TO HOLD GRUDGES. A PRESIDENT HAS TO NOT ONLY FIGHT, THAT A PRESIDENT HAS TO BE ABLE TO HEAL. THIS NATION NEEDS HEALING. I REALLY MEAN IT. THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME AND MY FAMILY, THEY ARE ABOUT YOU. ABOUT YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND WHAT'S NOT BEING DONE, AND HOW WHEN HE SAYS IN THESE AWFUL THINGS , NOT ABOUT ME ALONE, BUT ACROSS THE BOARD. THE LANGUAGE HE USES. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING. MY DAD USED TO SAY, THERE IS SILENCE WHEN SOMETHING BAD HAS HAPPENED, THAT'S COMPLICITY. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION BIGGER THAN WHETHER OR NOT A DEMOCRAT WINS. IT'S ABOUT WHERE WHETHER OR NOT WE RESTORE THE ESSENCE AND SOUL OF THE COUNTRY, WE ARE, WHAT WE STAND FOR. IT IS DOING US GREAT DAMAGE ACROSS THE WORLD AND AT HOME. AND AT HOME, IT IS WORSE. AS I SAID AT THE OUTSET, CHARACTER OF THE NATION IS ON THE BALLOT. AMERICA'S CHARACTER. I DO NOT BELIEVE AMERICA IS THAT DARK, ANGRY NATION WE SEE DONALD TRUMP TWEETING ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. I DON'T BELIEVE WE ARE A NATION THAT THINKS IT'S OK TO PUT KIDS IN CAGES ON THE BORDER. I DON'T BELIEVE WERE A NATION THAT FEELS ABOUT THE INVASION OF PEOPLE FROM THE SOUTH, THE MEXICAN RAPISTS COMING OUR WAY. THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE WERE A NATION THAT EMBRACES WHITE SUPREMACY AND HATE GROUPS, WHICH IS HAPPENING NOW. THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. [APPLAUSE] I DON'T BELIEVE WE ARE A NATION THAT LACKS THE COURAGE TO TAKE ON THE NRA SO OUR CHILDREN DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL IN FIRST GRADE AND LEARN HOW TO DUCK AND COVER. IT IS IMMORAL. [APPLAUSE] LOOK, WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT DONALD TRUMP STANDS FOR, WHAT HE BELIEVES, AND THE TERRIBLE THINGS HE SAYS, WHAT HE HAS DONE, WHAT I SEE AND I THINK IS WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS AS A NATION. DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS LISTENING TO US. WHEN HE SAID THOSE THINGS ABOUT GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES WHEN THOSE FOLKS CAME OUT OF THE FIELDS, HE SHOT THE NATION AND ABSOLUTELY PERPLEXED THE WORLD. FOREIGN LEADERS WERE ASKING PUBLICLY, WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? I BELIEVE IT IS WHAT DAVID BROOKS WRITES, HE SAYS THERE IS AN INVISIBLE MORAL FABRIC THAT HOLDS SOCIETIES UP. THAT FABRIC IS BEING RIPPED AND CUT BY THIS PRESIDENT, AND HAS TO BE AMENDED, RENDERED, FIXED, AND IT IS PRETTY SIMPLE. IT IS MADE UP OF THE AMERICAN CODE. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. WE, THE PEOPLE , WE HAVE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO IT, WE NEVER FULLY WALKED AWAY FROM IT. IT IS PRETTY BASIC. IT IS ABOUT HONESTY. DECENCY. TREATING EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY. NOT BELITTLING PEOPLE WITH HANDICAPS, OR PROBLEMS THAT THEY CAN SOLVE BECAUSE OF THOSE PHYSICAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'S ABOUT LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND. IT'S ABOUT GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR, DEMONIZING NO ONE, LEADING BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, NOT JUST THE EXAMPLE TO OUR POWER. AS RONALD REAGAN SAID, BEING THE SHINING CITY ON THE HILL TO WHICH THE REST OF THE WORLD LOOKS TO FOR HOPE AND GIVES FROM, BECAUSE THEY THINK MAY, JUST MAYBE, IT IS A CODE, A UNIQUELY AMERICAN CODE. A COLD DONALD TRUMP DEMONSTRATED HE HAS NOT SUBSCRIBED TO. HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN. THINK OF THE THINGS HE THINKS AS WEAKNESS, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DECENCY AND FAIRNESS, GIVING THE OTHER GUY A CHANCE, HE THINKS THAT SHOWS WEAKNESS. NOT A JOKE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO REACH OUT, GIVE EVERYBODY A SHOT, HE THINKS IT IS WEAKNESS. YOU SHOULD BE STRONG, IT IS ABOUT YOURSELF. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE. IN MY VIEW, IT REALLY MATTERS. AMERICA IS UNIQUE IN ALL OF HISTORY. WE ARE THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD WHO HAS BEEN ORGANIZED ON AN IDEA. THINK ABOUT THIS GOING HOME, WITH YOUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN, HUSBAND OR WIFE, WHOEVER YOU HAPPEN TO GO HOME WITH, HOW WILL YOU DEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES BEING AN AMERICAN? DEFINE WHAT A FRENCHMAN IS, WHAT A KOREAN IS, WHAT A CHINESE PERSON IS, WHAT , YOU CAN DEFINE IT. IT IS EASILY BASED UPON THE NOTION OF ETHNICITY, RELIGION, OR TRIBE. HOW ARE WE DEFINED , HOW HAVE WE DEFINED WHAT AN AMERICAN IS? YOU CAN'T. BECAUSE WE ARE SO DIVERSE. BUT EVERY AMERICAN SIGNS ONTO IT, WHETHER THEY SAY IT THIS WAY OR NOT. THE ESSENCE OF WHAT WE THINK THE CONSTITUTION IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS, WE DON'T LIVE UP TO IT, BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT, WE THE PEOPLE. MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY ARMY, ANY DICTATOR IN THE WORLD, IT IS BIGGER AND WIDER THAN THE OCEAN. IT IS MORE CONSEQUENTIAL THAN ANY GOVERNMENT. WE ARE UNIQUE IN THE WORLD. IF WE LET THIS CORROSIVE PROCESS CONTINUE, IT IS LIKE BATTERY ACID. I REALLY MEAN IT. I'M NOT JOKING ABOUT THIS. THINK OF WHAT IT DOES TO AMERICA. THE IDEA IS NOT AN IDEA, NOT AN IDEA DONALD TRUMP SHARES. THIS NATION NEEDS TO COME TOGETHER. I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE PROGRESS ON MATTERS THAT MATTER MOST TO US ALL. STARTING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL FIT , CONSEQUENTIAL THREAT THAT PLAGUES AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] CIVIL LIBERTIES, CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, HEALTH CARE, GUN POLICY, AND AN ECONOMY THAT BEGINS TO REWARD WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. WHY SHOULD IT BE THAT A MULTIMILLIONAIRE WHO MAY BE A DECENT PERSON, WHY SHOULD THEY PAY AT A LOWER TAX RATE THAN THEIR SECRETARY SHOULD? WE CAN CHANGE THIS. THIS GOD-AWFUL TAX CUT HE PUT FORWARD, IT HELPS ONLY .2% , 2% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IF WE MAKE SURE EVERYBODY PAYS THE SAME TAX ON THEIR CAPITAL GAINS AS WHETHER TAX RATE IS AND RAISE THE TAX RATE BACK TO WHAT IT WAS AT 49.6%, JUST DOING THAT ONE THING, PUNISHING NOBODY, IT RAISES $800 BILLION. IF WE JUST MADE SURE , I COME FROM THE CORPORATE STATE OF AMERICA, DELAWARE. IF WE JUST MADE CORPORATIONS PAY , MULTITRILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS PAY NO TAX AT ALL. IF YOU JUST SAID YOU HAD TO PAY A MINIMUM OF 50%, NO MATTER HOW MANY LOOPHOLES YOU HAVE, THAT WOULD RAISE ANOTHER $40 BILLION. IF YOU JUST SAID WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE YOU PAY NOT 20%, BUT 28%, THAT RAISES ABOUT $750 BILLION. THERE PUNISHING NOBODY. JUST BEGIN TO REWARD WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. [APPLAUSE] MY CONCLUDING POINT IS THIS, TO DO ALL THIS, PROMISES AREN'T ENOUGH. THE OLD SAYING IS TALK IS CHEAP, WELL IN POLITICS, TALK IS SOMETIMES VERY EXPENSIVE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DON'T TELL PEOPLE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR WHAT YOU TELL THEM YOU ARE GOING TO DO. DON'T YOU KIND OF FIND IT FASCINATING? GOOD PEOPLE ON OUR TEAM HAVE THESE INCREDIBLY GOOD IDEAS I WONDER WHY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT IS GOING TO COST. TAKE MEDICARE FOR ALL. HOW MUCH IT IS GOING TO COST IF WE GIVE ALL STUDENT DEBT. HOW MUCH IS GOING TO COST GOING DOWN THE LIST. THE NUMBER ADDS UP ACCORDING TO THE SENIOR ECONOMISTS AS SOMEWHERE IN THE AREA OF $60 TRILLION OVER 10 YEARS. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO, WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP. THE ONE THING YOU CAN DO IS END UP NOT BEING STRAIGHT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, HE WILL EAT YOU ALIVE. HE WILL LEAD US ALIVE. TELL IT STRAIGHT. TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST, WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. WE CAN HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE, FOR $700 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. WE CAN DEAL WITH EDUCATION. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS. HERE IS THE DEAL, WE HAVE THE LEVEL. EVERYONE IN THIS RACE TALKS ABOUT HEALTH CARE, BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO ACTUALLY LAID INTO LAW OBAMACARE. I WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT ON THAT. [APPLAUSE] NOW THAT EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO, GET RID OF HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING YOUR GOVERNORS, NOW WE NEED TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WANTED TO TAKE THE FIRST TIME, PROVIDE A PUBLIC OPTION. A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION THAT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR INSURANCE, YOU CAN'T, IF YOU DON'T, YOU CAN GET THE MEDICARE OPTION. IF YOU QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID, YOU AUTOMATICALLY ENROLL IN THE MEDICARE OPTION IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT. WE BRING DOWN DRUG PRICES SIGNIFICANTLY. NOT RAISING THE PRICE OF DRUGS BE ON THE COST OF MEDICAL INFLATION. IF YOU WANT PROGRESSIVE CHANGE ON HEALTH CARE, I WILL SAY IT TO YOU PLAINLY, I'M THE ONLY ONE WITH MORE THAN A PLAN, I HAVE A RECORD OF HAVING GOTTEN IT DONE. [APPLAUSE] EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT GUNS, I'M THE ONLY ONE NATIONALLY WHO HAS ACTUALLY GOTTEN BIG RATIONAL GUN LEGISLATION PASSED. I'M THE GUY THAT PASSED THE BRADY BILL WITH BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT GOT EVISCERATED LATER. ALONG WITH DIANNE FEINSTEIN IN THE U.S. SENATE, WE GOT ASSAULT WEAPONS BANNED AND LIMITED THE NUMBERS OF ALL ITS YOU CAN HAVE IN A CLIP. WHO IN GOD'S NAME NEEDS 100 ROUNDS IN A CLIP? NOBODY. I HAVE A 20 GAUGE AND A 12 GAUGE, I'M NOT A HUNTER, BUT I SKEET SHOOT. MY SONS WERE DUCK HUNTERS. GEESE FLYING INTERNATIONALLY FROM CANADA DOWN, YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO HAVE THREE SHELLS. WE PREDICT EAST BETTER THAN WE DO PEOPLE. WHY CAN WE HAVE THREE SHELLS VERSUS A SHOTGUN, WHEN YOU CAN HAVE 40, 50, 60, 200 ROUNDS. YOU SAW WITH THAT DATE IN LAS VEGAS. YOU SO WHAT IT'S DONE ACROSS THE NATION. I PROMISE YOU IF I AM YOUR CANDIDATE AND PRESIDENT, I WILL BEAT THE NRA AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] WE TALK ABOUT , EVERYONE HAS PLANS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. I PASSED THE BIDEN BILL, THE FIRST CLIMATE CHANGE BILL IN THE SENATE IN 1987. REAL POLITICS SAID IT WAS A GAME CHANGER. LONG BEFORE PEOPLE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT IT. IN OUR ADMINISTRATION, HE PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE RECOVERY ACT. WE MADE AN INVESTMENT, THE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE U.S. IN CLEAN ENERGY. SUN AND SOLAR, BECAUSE THE RESEARCH BRINGING DOWN THE PRICE IS AS LOW AS THE PRICE OF COAL. THAT'S WHY NO ONE IS GOING TO BUILD ANOTHER COAL PLANT. IT IS NOT EVEN ECONOMICAL ANYMORE. I WORKED WITH JOHN KERRY, WE PASSED THE CLIMATE ACCORD IN PARIS. IF YOU WANT PROGRESSIVE CHANGE IN A CLIMATE, I TAKE A BACKSEAT TO NOBODY. NOBODY AT ALL. [APPLAUSE] I'M THE ONLY ONE RUNNING WHO HAS DONE IT SO FAR. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHO YOU ARE GOING TO CAUCUS FOR, HERE'S WHAT I CAN TELL YOU. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE PROMISES, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THEM. I'VE GOT A RECORD TO PROVE IT. I HAVE PASSED MORE MAJOR LEGISLATION THROUGH CONGRESS AS A SENATOR AND VICE PRESIDENT THAN ALL OTHER FOLKS COMBINED WHO ARE RUNNING. THEY ARE NOT BAD FOLKS, THEY ARE GOOD FOLKS. BUT I HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN KNOWING HOW TO GET IT DONE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS, YOU HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE DEMOCRATS CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION, AND WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE TO PICK OUR HEADS UP. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A THING WE CAN'T DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA, A PRESIDENT'S TAX RETURNS WON'T BE SECRET, THEY WILL BE PUBLIC. POLITICAL SELF INTERESTS WILL NOT BE CONFUSED WITH THE NATIONAL INTERESTS. AND NO ONE, NOT EVEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WILL BE ABOVE THE LAW, I PROMISE YOU. GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] MANY OF YOU ARE HERE TONIGHT AS BIDEN SUPPORTERS AND PLAN ON CAUCUSING FOR JOE ON MONDAY NIGHT. SOME OF YOU MAY BE HERE UNDECIDED. LET ME SPEAK TO BOTH GROUPS. TO THOSE WHO ARE BIDEN SUPPORTERS, I WANT TO EQUIP YOU WITH THE ABILITY TO TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS BETWEEN NOW, MONDAY NIGHT, AND ON MONDAY NIGHT IN THE CAUCUS, TO PERSUADE THEM TO BECOME BIDEN SUPPORTERS. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE UNDECIDED, I WANT TO MAKE THE CASE. I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN JOE BIDEN IN ACTION. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES IS A VERY SERIOUS JOB, AND JOE BIDEN IS A VERY SERIOUS MAN. HE SAID EARLIER IN HIS COMMENTS THAT THE CHILDREN ARE LISTENING, AND HE TALKED ABOUT HIS GREAT GRANDKIDS WHO ARE HERE. I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT MY GRANDSON. HE HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES AS THE SMALLEST AND CUTEST SURROGATE FOR A GRANDFATHER. BUT I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY HIS FATHER, BECAUSE WE LOST OUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER SEVERAL YEARS AGO, OUR FAMILY KIND OF STRUGGLED THROUGH ALL OF THAT. WE KIND OF GOT OFF OF SCHEDULE. WE DIDN'T GET TO GO TO FIRST COMMUNION CLASS WHEN HE NEEDED TO. HE ASKED THE FIRST COMMUNITY CLASS FOR JAKE. I THOUGHT I WOULD START WITH THE 10 COMMANDMENTS. I SAID IT IS SIMPLE, THE FIRST THREE COMMITMENTS ABOUT HOW WE LOVE AND RESPECT GOD, HOW WE LOVE AND RESPECT EACH OTHER. I THOUGHT I NEEDED TO PUT A FINER POINT ON THIS. I SAID THERE ARE SOME PASTORS AND MINISTERS, PRIESTS WHO ARE NOT REALLY HAPPY WITH THE PRESIDENT. JAKE SAID WHY IS THAT? I SAID BECAUSE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT TAKES THE LORDS'S NAME IN VAIN IN PUBLIC FAR TOO FREQUENTLY FOR THOSE FOLKS. THEY DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT, THEY DON'T THINK IT'S RESPECTFUL. I THOUGHT THAT WAS ENOUGH. I THOUGHT WE COULD MOVE ONTO ANOTHER SUBJECT. JAKE DIDN'T MISS A BEAT. HE LOOKS AT ME AND SAYS THAT'S WHY WE NEED JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] HE'S 10 YEARS OLD AND HE GETS IT. THREE VERY SIMPLE MESSAGES ABOUT JOE BIDEN. HE IN FACT CAN GET THINGS DONE. I HAVE WATCHED IT. WHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS IN THE BALANCE, PRESIDENT OBAMA SENT JOE BIDEN TO CONGRESS. WHEN THE RECOVERY ACT WAS IN THE BALANCE, THOUGH BIDEN WAS SENT TO CONGRESS TO GET THE JOB DONE. WHEN THE PRESIDENT WANTED SOMEONE TO ACTUALLY OVERSEE THE RECOVERY ACT, HE PUT JOE BIDEN IN CHARGE. I WAS IN COUNTLESS MEETINGS WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT WHERE HE URGED US TO GET THE RESOURCES OUT. BECAUSE OF THAT, OUR ECONOMY WAS SAVED. I HAVE SEEN JOE BIDEN IN ACTION. HE NOT ONLY HAS THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE TO GET THE THINGS HE WANTS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, HE HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE TO GET THINGS DONE. THAT'S WHY HE WAS SENT UP TO CONGRESS. THOSE FOLKS TRUSTED JOE. THEY WILL TRUST HIM AGAIN WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT THE NEED FOR EXPANDED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THEY WILL TRUST HIM AGAIN AS HE TALKS ABOUT HOW WE CAN REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. NO ONE IN THIS RACE HAS THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT JOE BIDEN HAS. NUMBER TWO, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE WORLD BEING IN A MESS, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE WORLD, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WORLD, AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WORLD LEADERS. YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT MAKES THEM TICK. JOE BIDEN DOESN'T NEED PRIMER OR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING, HE DOESN'T NEED A SIX MONTHS OR TWO YEARS TO GET TO KNOW THESE FOLKS AND UNDERSTAND WHO THEY ARE. FROM THE VERY FIRST MINUTE ON THE VERY FIRST DAY, JOE BIDEN CAN BEGIN THE PROCESS OF REPAIRING THE CREDIBILITY THAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP RESTORING OUR REPUTATION, REBUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY TO BE THE GLOBAL LEADER WE WANT IT TO BE. HE COULD DO THIS FROM DAY ONE BECAUSE HE KNOWS THESE WORLD LEADERS AND THEY KNOW HIM. THOSE WORLD LEADERS TRUST JOE BIDEN. HE KNOWS THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE WORLD. HERE'S A LITTLE SECRET. YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY REBUILD THE ECONOMY AND EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE, REPAIR OUR RELATIONSHIPS UNLESS YOU WIN. YOU HAVE TO WIN TO GOVERN. YOU HAVE TO HAVE MORE VOTES THAN THE OTHER GUY. YOU NEED MORE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES THAN THE OTHER GUY. [APPLAUSE] I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU FOLKS DO LATE AT NIGHT, BUT I'M TELLING YOU WHAT I DO AT NIGHT, I LOOK AT STATE POLLS. I'M VERY INTERESTED NOT JUST IN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN IOWA, WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA THINKING? WHAT ABOUT GEORGIA, NORTH CAROLINA, VIRGINIA, PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN? MAYBE EVEN TEXAS? WHAT ARE THEY THINK ABOUT A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE? ARIZONA, NEVADA, COLORADO? HERE'S WHAT I CAN TELL YOU BASED ON THE POLES I HAVE SEEN, THE RECENT POLLS, THE POLES RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NO DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE, NONE, EXCEPT ONE, WHO IS BEATING AND IS COMPETITIVE WITH DONALD TRUMP IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE STATES, INCLUDING TEXAS, THAN JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] SO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU WIN FLORIDA, GEORGIA, NORTH CAROLINA, VIRGINIA, TEXAS, PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, IOWA, NEVADA, ARIZONA, COLORADO? THEY SWEAR YOU IN AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. [APPLAUSE] SO THOSE ARE THE THREE SOLID REASONS HE IS THE MOST ELECTABLE DEMOCRAT, HE CAN GET'S DONE AND REPAIR OUR RELATIONSHIP. I WANT TO SHARE ONE MORE REASON THAT IS PERSONAL TO ME. IT HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO HERE TONIGHT, THE BIDEN FAMILY HAS SUFFERED. MY FAMILY,, I CAN TELL YOU IT WAS REALLY HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE SENSE, THE PURPOSE, WHY EVEN GO ON? OUR SON WAS DEVASTATED BY THE LOSS OF HIS DAUGHTER. HE GOES TO A BIDEN EVENT EARLY IN THE CAMPAIGN, WALKS UP AS HE MAY WALK UP TO SOME OF YOU TONIGHT, ASKS HOW HE'S DOING. MY SON THINKING OF THIS AS A POLITICIAN, ASKING HOW YOU ARE DOING, THEN HE WILL PASS ON TO THE NEXT GUY, HE SAYS HE'S DOING FINE. BUT JOE BIDEN IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF POLITICIAN, A DIFFERENT KIND OF PERSON, BECAUSE HE SUFFERED. HE STOPPED JUST AND ASKED HOW HE WAS FEELING. \"WE ARE IN A FRATERNITY WE DIDN'T CHOOSE TO BELONG TO, AND I KNOW YOU ARE SUFFERING, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FEELING, BECAUSE I FELT IT.\" THAT'S CALLED EMPATHY. THAT'S CALLED THE CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT OTHERS HAVE SUFFERED. TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUFFERING AND CONVEY A SENSE THAT DESPITE THE PAIN THAT YOU CAN PUT ONE STEP FORWARD, THAT YOU COULD MOVE TO A BETTER DAY. WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT? BECAUSE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS TO HAVE THAT QUALITY. HE HAS TO HAVE THAT QUALITY WHEN HE WALKS INTO A GYMNASIUM WITH PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN GUNNED DOWN AND EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF THAT TRAGEDY. HE HAS TO HAVE THAT WHEN HE GOES TO A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY A TORNADO. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WIPED OUT BY A FIRE. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY A FLOOD. PEOPLE'S LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST. TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU GET IT, YOU UNDERSTAND, YOU ARE HERE TO HELP, WE CAN DO THIS AND GET TO A BETTER PLACE. HE CERTAINLY HAS TO HAVE IT WHEN HE TALKS TO THE FAMILY OF SOMEONE WHO BRAVELY SERVED US IN THE MILITARY, WHOSE LIFE WAS LOST IN WAR. DO YOU REMEMBER DONALD TRUMP IN PUERTO RICO? DO YOU REMEMBER THE PAPER TOWELS? WERE YOU PROUD OF YOUR NATION'S REACTION TO THAT TRAGEDY THEN? OF COURSE NOT, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT PRESIDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. IT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC FOR A PRESIDENT THAT CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. WHEN YOU DECIDE TO SUPPORT JOE BIDEN, YOU ARE NOT ONLY SUPPORTING THE GUY WHO IS MOST LIKELY TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP, AND WE KNOW DONALD TRUMP DOES THAT, NOT JUST THE GUY THAT CAN GET THINGS DONE THAT WE WANT DONE, AND NOT THE GUY WHO WILL BE ABLE TO REPAIR OUR BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD YOU ARE GOING TO GET A PRESIDENT THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY YOU CAN BE PROUD OF, AND WHO WILL SPEND EVERY WAKING MOMENT, EVERY OUNCE OF ENERGY HE HAS TO HEAL THIS GREAT NATION. HE JUST DOESN'T BELIEVE IN HIMSELF, HE BELIEVES IN US. HE BELIEVES WE CAN BE BETTER, WE CAN BE UNITED, HE WANTS TO HEAL US. HE NEEDS OUR HELP TO BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK TO UNITE US AGAIN. MONDAY NIGHT, JOE BIDEN, OUR GUY. [APPLAUSE] (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) I MISSED YOU LAST NIGHT.

WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO COME OUT OF THERE REALLY DOING WELL, BUT YOU KNOW, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY BECAUSE IT'S NOT DONE YET. I KNOW THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS TRYING TO WORK THROUGH ALL THE ISSUES WITH THAT APPLICATION THEY HAD. THEY HAD THAT APP AND OTHER PROBLEMS. I SAID LAST NIGHT, LET'S GIVE THEM TIME. I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL. LET'S GIVE THEM TIME TO WORK OUT THOSE ISSUES CAREFULLY BECAUSE A LOT DEPENDS ON IT. SO WE DON'T KNOW WHOA SEESLY HOW MANY DELEGATES , HOW MANY DELEGATES WE HAVE.

[LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING MY CASE ALL ACROSS THIS STATE AND UNTIL NEXT TUESDAY. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I THINK ABOUT ALL THE FAMILIES , WHAT ALL THE FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH IN THIS COUNTRY AND EVEN TODAY. WHETHER IT'S STARING AT THE CEILING BECAUSE YOU HAVE JUST BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER, AND MY INTRODUCER CAN TELL YOU, OR YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOUR FAMILY'S GOING TO MAKE IT OR YOU'RE 50 YEARS OLD AND YOU JUST LOST YOUR JOB. YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO NEXT. OR YOU JUST GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE WITH SO MUCH DEBT THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IN LORD'S NAME DO I GET STARTED. IT JUST MAKES ME WORK HARDER FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT I KNOW. THIS COUNTRY WAS NOT BUILT BY WALL STREET BANKERS. IT WAS BUILT NOT , NOT BUILT BY C.E.O.'S. IT WAS BUILT BY YOU, HARDWORKING PEOPLE JUST LIKE MY FAMILY. JUST ASKED FOR NOTHING ELSE BUT A CHANCE. GIVE ME A CHANCE. ORDINARY PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, NONE OF US WERE GIVING MUCH OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE LOVE OF OUR FAMILIES. WE HAD TO FIGHT FOR EVERYTHING WE EVER GOT. MY FATHER USED TO SAY, JOE, I DON'T EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS. BUT I AT LEAST EXPECT THEM TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. THAT'S OUR JOB. OUR JOB IS NOT TO NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND BUT OUR JOB , THE SIMPLE TRUTH ABOUT IT, IN THIS COUNTRY, WE HAVE TO GIVE EVERYBODY A SHOT. MY DAD USED TO ALWAYS SAY , I REALLY MEAN THIS. HE SAID, EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. EVERYONE. AND GIVEN HALF A CHANCE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER IN WAR OR IN PEACE LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN. NOT ONE SINGLE, SOLITARY TIME. AND I SAID IT FROM THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCED, WE'RE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. EVERYTHING THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR AND BELIEVES IN, OUR LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD IS AT STAKE. WHEN I SAID THAT SIX OR EIGHT MONTHS AGO, PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS AN EXAGGERATION NOW SERVE ACKNOWLEDGING IT. WE SAW IT LAST WEEK, WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS ABOVE THE LAW, WE HAVE A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS THAT'S DECIDED TO PUT THEIR LOYALTY TO THE PARTY AND THE PRESIDENT AHEAD OF THEIR LOYALTY TO THE CONSTITUTION. YOU KNOW, I REALLY , I REALLY THINK WHAT'S ON THE BALLOT THIS TIME IS CHARACTER. CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT THIS TIME. I DON'T BELIEVE , [APPLAUSE] THE CHARACTER OF THE CANDIDATES, THE VERY CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY AS THE REST OF THE WORLD LOOKS AT US. I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE A DARK, ANGRY NATION THAT DONALD TRUMP , [CROWD CHANTING \"WE WANT JOE\"] JOE THAMPLETE FOLLOW ME ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, THEY LOVE ME. FOLKS, FOLKS, LOOK. FOLKS, FOLKS. [CROWD YELLING] JOE: FOLKS, THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH POLITICS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT'S OK. COME HERE, COME HERE. NO. I HOPE YOU'RE OK, KIDDO. I HOPE YOU'RE OK. GOD LOVE YOU. THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING UP. THANK YOU. THERE'S SO MANY YOUNG WOMEN AND MEN WHO BENEFITED FROM THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT THAT I WROTE, YOU REALIZE HOW MANY OTHERS YOU HELP BY SPEAKING OUT. THANK YOU, KIDDO. THANK YOU. LOOK, I DON'T BELIEVE IN SAYING WHAT WE JUST SAW THAT WE'RE THE ANGRY NATION DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES WE ARE. I DON'T BELIEVE, I REALLY, HONEST TO GOD, DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE A NATION THAT PUTS KIDS IN CAGES AN THINKS IT'S OK. I DON'T THINK , OH, PAL. COME ON, PAL, GIVE ME A BREAK, WILL YOU? NOW YOU KNOW HOW STRONGLY TRUMP DOESN'T WANT ME TO RUN AGAINST HIM. FOLKS, I APOLOGIZE. BY THE WAY. BY THE WAY, THIS IS THE LISTEN WHY I'M RUNNING. WE HAVE TO STOP. THIS WE HAVE TO STOP. THIS [APPLAUSE] , TO STOP THIS. [APPLAUSE] I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS WHO WE ARE. IT'S NOT. IT'S AN OVERWHELMING MINORITY. BUT FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE A NATION THAT BUILDS WALLS AND WHIPS US INTO HYSTERIA OVER THE INVASION OF IMMIGRANTS. I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE A NATION THAT EMBRACES WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND HATE GROUPS. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S WHO WE ARE. I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE A NATION THAT'S GOING TO BOW DOWN TO VLADIMIR PUTIN. I KNOW I WILL NOT. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT HE STANDS FOR, HOW HE BEHAVES, WHAT HE'S DONE, MY RESPONSE IS ALWAYS THE SAME. WE'RE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, INDEPENDENT, WE'RE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. LOOK, I BELIEVE THERE'S WHAT SOME PEOPLE CALL AN INVISIBLE WALL OF , INVISIBLE MORAL FABRIC THAT HOLDS UP SOCIETY. IT'S MADE , BLESS ME, FATHER. [LAUGHTER] IT'S GOOD TO BE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. GOOD TO BE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. FOLKS, LOOK. LOOK. YOU KNOW, I TALK ABOUT THIS INVISIBLE MORAL FABRIC THAT HOLDS UP EVERY SOCIETY. CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST DAVID BUFF TALKS ABOUT IT, HE SAID IT'S MADE UP OF THE BASIC, FUNDAMENTAL CORE VALUES OF AMERICA. GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. MAKING SURE WE LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND. HELP ORG PEOPLE. REALIZING THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. GIVING EVERYBODY A FAIR SHOT. JUST A FAIR SHOT. LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND. NOT DEMONIZING AND RIDICULING THE POOR, THE HANDICAPPED, THE IMMIGRANT, THE OTHER. AND LEADING BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE, NOT JUST THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER. RONALD REAGAN SAID IT, THAT SHINE STIG ON A HILL. BEING PART OF SOMETHING SO MUCH BIGGER THAN WE ARE INDIVIDUALLY. IT'S A CODE. IT'S A CODE YOU EMBRACE HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. IT'S A CODE THEY EMBRACE AT HOME. IT'S UNIQUELY AN AMERICAN CODE. AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO INHERIT A COUNTRY THAT IS DIVIDED AND A WORLD THAT'S IN DISARRAY. THERE'S GOING TO BE NO TIME FOR ON THE JOB TRAINING IN MY HUMBLE OPINION. WE'RE GOING TO NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS READY ON DAY ONE. SOMEONE WHO CAN COMMAND. [APPLAUSE] SOMEONE WHO CAN COMMAND WORLD STAGE, MEET OUR ARMED FORCES AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, REPAIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR ALLIES AND ONCE MORE MAKE THE UNITED STATES NOT ONLY THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD BUT THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH HEALTH CARE ISSUES IS DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AS JEAN UNDERSTANDS, I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW HOW INCREDIBLY THANKFUL I AM TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT AGAIN, JEAN, I MEAN IT, ANYWAY. YOU KNOW, AND I KNOW A CANCER DIAGNOSIS DOES TO A FAMILY. RAISE YOUR HAND IF ANY OF YOU HAVE LOST A SON, DAUGHTER, HUSBAND, WIFE, BROTHER, CYSTERS TO CANCER, OR YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM CANCER. YOU GET IT. YOU UNDERSTAND. WHAT JEAN IS GOING THROUGH SOONED MANY MORE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. I KNOW THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP GOING WHEN YOU LOSE SOMEONE OR YOU'RE IN THAT SITUATION IS TO FIND SOME PURPOSE. JEAN, YOU'RE A FIGHTER. AND SO AM I. YOU'RE A FIGHTER, PAL. SO I KNOW , I KNOW AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I'LL FIGHT FOR YOU AND PEOPLE LIKE YOU AS IF IT WERE MY OWN FAMILY. FOLKS, FOLKS WE RELY ON OBAMACARE FOR HEALTH CARE AND THE VERY QUALITY OF LIFE. THAT'S A BIG PART OF WHY I'M RUNNING. OBAMACARE IS THE REASON MORE THAN 50,000 GRANITE STATERS HAD MEDICAID COVERAGE AND ACCESS TO TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. I FOUND IT ASTOUNDING, I LEARNED THE OTHER DAY THAT DONALD TRUMP SAID HE'S THE REASON WHY PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ARE COVERED. ISN'T THAT FASCINATING? I'M SERIOUS. HE'S IN COURT TRYING TO DO , SAY THE WHOLE LAW IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT HE SAID HE'S THE REASON WE'VE GOT COVERAGE FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY YOU CAN KEEP YOUR CHILD ON A POLICY UNTIL AGE 26. THAT'S HOW SOME 20 MILLION PEOPLE IN AMERICA TIMELY GOT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. AND WE CAN'T LET ANYTHING THREATEN THAT. SO IT'S TIME TO GET REAL ABOUT HEALTH CARE. I BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO GO FORWARD IS TO BUILD ON OBAMACARE WITH A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION, A PUBLIC OPTION. MEDICARE IF YOU WANT IT. IT'S A PLAN THAT WILL LOWER CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND ALLOWS YOU TO KEEP YOUR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO D OR BUY IN IF YOU DONE CHOOSE TO. IF YOU DON'T ARE THE MONEY YOU'RE ABLE TO GET IN FREE. IT'S A PLAN THAT WILL GET PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES UNDER CONTROL. IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY, IT COSTS $750 MILLION OVER THE , $750 BILLION OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. IF WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT RAISING TAXES, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY BUT IT'S NOT $30 TRILLION THE OTHERS ARE TALKING ABOUT FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL. $30 TRILLION. $30 TRILLION TO $40 TRILLION. I CAN GET MY PLAN PASSED THROUGH THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, I CAN GET IT DONE RIGHT AWAY. SENATOR SANDERS, GOD LOVE HIM, AND THE OTHER, ATTACKED MY HEALTH CARE PLAN AND SAID IT'S TOO SMALL. FIRST OF ALL THEY'RE DEAD WRONG ABOUT WHAT IT COVERS. IT WAS A HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT THAT THIS PARTY SHOULD BE PROUD TO DEFEND. BUT LOOK, BERNIE HAS TALKED ABOUT A SINGER , SINGLE PAYER MEDICARE SYSTEM FOR , HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR THE COUNTRY FOR 30 YEARS NOW. HASN'T MOVED IT AN INCH. SMART BOTH THE VERMONT , VERMONT PAST GOVERNORS ENDORSED ME. IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE NOW. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE ISN'T FOR IT. HOW SIT GOING TO PASS? HOW IS IT GOING TO MOVE? HOW DOES IT GET DONE? YOU CAN'T GIVE A SPEECH ABOUT IT. IT ACTUALLY HAS TO GET DONE. THE FACT IS, NOW BERNIE, HE WAS BEING STRAIGHT BEFORE, TALKING ABOUT IS GOING TO RAISE MIDDLE CLASS TAXES. NOW HE AND THE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF MEDICARE FOR ALL WANT TO TELL , WON'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT COSTS. WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. USED TO SAY $30 TRILLION WITH A MIDDLE CLASS INCREASE. BUT NOT MORE. NOW HE SAYS NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'LL COST. WON'T SAY WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT. TRY PASSING A $30 TRILLION PLAN THROUGH THE CONGRESS AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT. HOW MUCH IS , IT'S GOING TO COST AND WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. I'M NOT QUESTIONING HIS INTENTIONS. BUT HOW IS IT GOING TO GO, CONVINCE ANYONE IN THIS COUNTRY? BUT LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPECULATE WHO HAS THE BETTER APPROACH. IN 2018, I CAMPAIGNED IN 24 STATES FOR OVER 65 CANDIDATES. AND THEY'RE IN STATES WHERE DEMOCRATS WON IN THE TOUGHEST DISTRICTS IN AMERICA. AND THAT OPPOSED MEDICARE FOR ALL. NOT A ONE OF THEM THAT I'M AWARE OF RAN ON THE IDEA THAT , WELL THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY, THAT RAN ON THE IDEA THAT MEDICARE FOR ALL WOULD PASS. YOU KNOW. 30 OUT OF THE 39 DEMOCRATS WHO WON THE TOUGHEST DISTRICTS IN AMERICA, THEY ALL OPPOSED MEDICARE FOR ALL. NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE OPPOSED TO HEALTH CARE. BECAUSE THEY WANT A RATIONAL WAY IN WHICH TO HAVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EMBRACE WHAT THEY'RE BEGINNING TO EMBRACE ACROSS THE BOARD YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN WE PASSED OBAMACARE, WE LOST THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THE NEXT YEAR. AND EVERYBODY SAYS IT'S BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE. WELL, GUESS WHAT? WHEN THE REPUBLICANS STARTED TO GET RID OF IT, CUT IT, DO AWAY WIT, GO TO COURT TO SAY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THERE ANYMORE, WHAT HAPPENED? ALL OF A SUDDEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MANY OF YOU, I SUSPECT, SAID WAIT A MINUTE. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT MY KID WHO HAS DOWN SYNDROME OR ASTHMA OR ANY OTHER PRE-EXISTING CONDITION OR CANCER, I DIDN'T KNOW THE REASON THEY'RE ABLE TO BE COVERED IS BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE. WHEN IT PASSED, I URGED THE PRESIDENT TO TALK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND SPEND MORE TIME EXPLAINING WHAT IT DID. HE SAID JOE, IT'S CLASSIC BARACK, HE SAID WE DENT HAVE TIME TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP, WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO DO. IT WASN'T UNTIL IT GOT CUT YOU ALL REALIZED WHAT IT WAS. AND WHAT HAPPENED? IT'S COME ROARING BACK IN A BIG WAY PAUSE PEOPLE NOW KNOW WHAT WE DID AND WHAT WAS BEING LOST. SO FOLKS, I THINK WE HAVE TO MOVE. I CAN TELL YOU, ALL YOU WHO RAISED YOUR HAND, WHO HAVE CANCER YOURSELF OR LOST SOMEONE TO CANCER, YOU NEED HOPE YOU NEED HOPE. NOT NEXT WEEK. NOT , MOST OF THE CANDIDATES ARE FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL ARE SAYING IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOUR YEARS TO PASS, THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STRUCTURE, COULD BE 10 YEARS. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE NEED HOPE NOW. SO WE WANT REAL PROGRESSIVE CHANGE IN HEALTH CARE, REAL CHANGE, NOT JUST TALK. AND I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THIS RACE WHO HAS EVER GOT AN BIG HEALTH CARE REFORM BILL THROUGH THE CONGRESS. IT'S CALLED OBAMACARE. [APPLAUSE] I WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA TO GET IT DONE. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE CRISIS THAT THREATEN OURS CHILDREN, OUR GRANDKIDS AS WELL. IT'S CALLED CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S A KILLER. [APPLAUSE] I PASSED THE FIRST CLIMATE CHANGE BILL IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, THE UNITED STATES SENATE, IN 1987. POLITIFACT, WHO GOES AND CHECKS WHETHER THINGS ARE TRUE OR FALSE, CALLED IT A GAME-CHANGER. THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, INSIDE THE $900 RECOVERY ACT THE PRESIDENT PUT ME IN CHARGE OF TO KEEP IT FROM GOING INTO DEPRESSION, WE MADE A RECORD INVESTMENT FOR CLEAN NRNL, WIND, AND SOLAR. I WORKED WITH JOHN KERY RY WHO HELPED PASS , I WORKED WITH JOHN TO HELP PASS THE , NOT LEGISLATION BUT GET THE CLIMATE, THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT PASSED BY GETTING ALMOST 200 NATIONS TO SIGN UP. IN THIS CAMPAIGN WE ALL HAVE SERIOUS PLANS TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BUT THERE'S ONE BIG DIFFERENCE IN MINE. MY PLAN UNDERSTANDS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T JUST A DOMESTIC ISSUE. IT'S AN INTERCOMMARBLE ISSUE. I DID EVERYTHING WE HAVE TO DO AT HOME AND IF WE DO IT AND WE WILL, TO GET CARBON EMISSIONS UNDER CONTROL AND GET TO NET ZERO, THAT WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH. WE WON'T DO THAT. WE'RE JUST 15% OF THE PROBLEM HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE REST OF THE WORLD MAKES UP 5% OF THE PROBLEM. SO THIS IS ALSO FOREIGN POLICY ISSUE AS WELL. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. WE HAVE TO BRING THE LEADERS TOGETHER HERE, I'VE DONE THAT. I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THIS RACE WHO HAS EVER DONE THAT. I DID IT BY WORKING TOGETHER WITH , ON THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AS WELL. I DID IT BY PUTTING TOGETHER THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. WE PUT TOGETHER THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO FIGHT ISIS. EVERYONE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE. BUT ASK YOURSELF, WHO ELSE IN THIS RACE HAS BROUGHT WORLD LEADERS TOGETHER TO ADDRESS A MAJOR PROBLEM? I'M DETERMINED TO CHANGE THE CULTURE IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE WE THINK IT'S OK, OK TO SEND OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL, WHERE THE FIRST DAY THEY GO TO SCHOOL THEY LEARN HOW TO DUCK AND COVER. IT'S SHAMELESS. SHAMELESS. GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR SCHOOLS IS SHAMELESS. LOOK, I OWN A 20 GAUGE AND A 12 GAUGE, I KNOW HOW , I SKEET SHOOT MY BOYS, WE'RE DUCK HUNTERS. WE PROTECT INTERNATIONAL DUCK HUNTING MORE THAN PEOPLE. YOU CAN ONLY HAVE THREE SHELLS WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE SHOOTING GEESE. I'M THE GUY THAT GOT THE BRADY BILL PASSED WITH THE BACKGROUND CHECKS. [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE LEADING CONTENDERS RUNS AGAINST ME FOR THE NOMINATION VOTED AGAINST IT FIVE TIMES. I'M WORKING WITH SENATOR , I WORKED WITH SENATOR DIANE FEINSTEIN OF CALIFORNIA TO GET THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN FOR 10 YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY UNTIL WE HAD HANGING CHADS IN FLORIDA AN LOST THE PRESIDENCY. BUT I'LL GET THEM BANNED AGAIN. I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THIS RACE WHO HAS TAKE ON THE N.R.A. STRAIGHT UP AND FLAT BEATEN THEM, TWICE. [APPLAUSE] I'LL BEAT THEM AGAIN. I PROMISE YOU THIS, IF I'M PRESIDENT, WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF THE ONLY , GUN MANUFACTURERS CAN'T BE SUE LOODIC YOU SEE THE TOBACCO COMPANIES, IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. A COUPLE OF CANDIDATES VOTED FOR THAT AS WELL. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN BRING US TOGETHER, A LEADER, A LEADER WHO CAN UNITE THE PARTY, STARTING OFF, AND THEN UNITE THE COUNTRY. WE ARE A DEMOCRACY. EVERY DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON CONSENSUS. CONSENSUS. THERE'S NO WAY TO BE ABLE TO GOVERN TOSH PROGRESS IF WE CAN'T REACH A CONSENSUS YOU SHOULD OUR SYSTEM. SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PULL THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE RACE SAY THAT I'M NAIVE. NICE TO KNOW I'M NAIVE, I'VE BEEN AROUND A WHILE. I'M NAIVE BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE CAN UNIFY THE COUNTRY. I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE FOREVER AT WAR. THE REPUBLICANS AREN'T OUR ENEMIES, THEY'RE OPPOSITION. AND WE GET RID OF STUFF LIKE YOU HEARD HERE TODAY, WE CAN DO AN AWFUL LOT. I'VE DONE IT MY WHOLE LIFE AND WILL DO IT AS YOUR PRESIDENT. THEY SAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY. JUST GOT A TASTE OF THAT NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY. I UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN ANYBODY, I'VE BEEN THE OBJECT OF THEIR AFFECTION FOR A LONG TIME. [APPLAUSE] MORE THAN ANYONE. AND I WONDER WHY THEY SPEND SO MUCH TIME TRYING TO KEEP MY FROM BEING THE NOMINEE? HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANOTHER PARTY SPEND AS MUCH TIME DECIDING WHO THE OTHER PARTY'S NOMINEE SHOULDN'T BE? I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT? I AM THE OBJECT OF THEIR , THEY SPENT $12 MILLION TO $15 MILLION IN NEGATIVE ADS THAT MOST MAINSTREAM STATIONS WON'T RUN, FOR REAL. I LEARNED A COUPLE OF THINGS. VLADIMIR PUTIN DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE PRESIDENT. LITERALLY. THEY'VE DONE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SO-CALLED BOTS ON, YOU KNOW, AND FINALLY FACEBOOK CAME ALONG AND SAID WE CAN'T PUT THEM ON, THEY'RE NOT HONEST. THEY'VE DECIDED THAT , THEY SAID 80 PEOPLE TO IOWA TO CAMPAIGN AGAINST ME GETTING THE NOMINATION. AND I'M , I DON'T KNOW. I WONDER IF THEY SCREWED UP THE COUNT. THAT'S A JOKE. THAT'S A JOKE. THAT'S A JOKE. BUT LOOK, FOLKS. THERE'S A LOT OF LOUSY STUFF GOING ON. BUT YOU KNOW, CAN'T HOLD GRUDGES. THE PRESIDENT HAS TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT BUT ALSO BE ABLE TO HEAL. I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE MATTERS THAT MATTER MOST TO US. CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY THAT WILL SAVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN, PROTECTING OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES, CIVIL RIGHTS, OUR SACRED RIGHT TO VOTE. DEFENDING A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. AND THE SCOURGE , ENDING THE SCOURGE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND SEXUAL ABUSE. EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. TAKING ON THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE. AND REWARD WORK NOT JUST WEALTH WHICH IS WHAT WE CO-NOW. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP. IS WE NEED TO SHOW THEM WHO WE ARE. EVEN THE PEOPLE IN HERE, I DOUBT THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO GROW UP LIKE DONALD TRUMP. I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS. NOT BEING FACETIOUS. WE KNOW WHO DONALD TRUMP. IS WE GOT TO LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. [APPLAUSE] WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION AND COMPASSION OVER CRUELTY. [APPLAUSE] AND FOLKS, YES. YES. WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER LIES. TRUTH OVER LIES. LOOK, FOLKS, THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NOT A SINGLE THING IS BEYOND OUR CAPACITY TO DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. NEVER HAVE WE EVER, EVER FAILED WHEN WE SET AN OBJECTIVE. NEVER. THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT IT. WHEN WE'VE ACTED TOGETHER. IT'S TIME TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. LET'S GET UP AND TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY AND TAKE IT BACK NOW. GOD BLESS YOU ALL, MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. FOR YOUR PATIENCE.

I APPRECIATE IT. HELLO, NEW HAMPSHIRE. [APPLAUSE] IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH YOU TONIGHT. ONE REASON IS, YOU KNOW HOW TO RUN ELECTIONS. YOU KNOW HOW TO RUN PRIMARIES. YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE DELEGATION IN JEANNE SHAHEEN AND MAGGIE HASSAN THAN CHRIS PAPPAS AND ANNIE KUSTER. GIVE THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. WE ALL KNOW THAT WE CAN'T STAND FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE KNOW BETTER. NOBODY TAKES THE RESPONSIBILITY MORE SERIOUSLY THAN YOU DO IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. YOU THINK FOR YOURSELVES, YOU KNOW OUR PARTY AND YOU KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS. I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES, AMERICA'S CHARACTER IS LITERALLY ON THE BALLOT. WE HAVE TO ACT. THE MAN I MET IN CLAREMONT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY DAYS AGO PULLED ME ASIDE AND SAID, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, I'M LOSING MY JOB, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL MY FAMILY, WHAT DO I SAY, HOW DO I DO IT? IT WAS INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL AND I SAID, I UNDERSTAND. I TOLD HIM ABOUT MY DAD WHEN HE HAD TO MAKE WHAT I CALL THE LONGEST WALK UP A SHORT FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO A KID'S BEDROOM AND SAY JOE, I DON'T HAVE A JOB, WE CAN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE, WE HAVE TO MOVE. BUT HE SAID, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK, AND HE MEANT IT. IT TOOK HIM THREE YEARS TO MOVE TO DELAWARE AND GET US A HOUSE TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN, BUT HE WAS CONFIDENT IT WOULD BE OK. BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE TODAY ARE ABLE TO LOOK THEIR CHILDREN AND THE EYE FACED WITH THAT KIND OF CRISIS AND SAY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK? THEY DON'T THINK IT IS GOING TO BE OK, BECAUSE WE HAVE MADE IT SO MUCH HARDER IN THIS COUNTRY UNDER THIS PRESIDENT, THAT IT WON'T MAKE IT OK. JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, 12 HOURS AGO, JILL AND I AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN STOOD IN LINE IN MANCHESTER FOR FOOD FOR CHILDREN, BITTERLY COLD, 22 DEGREES, THE WIND BLOWING, AND YOU SEE ALL THESE LITTLE CHILDREN STANDING IN LINE, HUDDLED, NO GLOVES, PHRASING, -- FREEZING, WAITING TO PICK UP A CARDBOARD BOX SO THEY CAN PUT BREAD IN IT, DOUGHNUTS IN IT, THINGS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET FOR FOOD, AND IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A WOMAN WITH BARELY A SWEATER ON HOLDING HER CHILD TIGHTLY IN TEARS COMING DOWN HER EYES AS SHE PICKED UP BREAD. THE MEN WHO CAME ALONG, UNABLE TOJUST THINKING, THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HOW CAN THAT BE HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN THE BITTER COLD WITH NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO. JUST GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF SUSTENANCE. ONE OF THE GUYS WALKED UP AND GAVE ME A SCHOOL CAP. WHY DO I HAVE IT? I GAVE IT TO ONE OF THE KIDS. THINK ABOUT IT. NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A LINE THAT LASTED AND LASTED AND LASTED. NO HOPE IN SIGHT FOR THESE PEOPLE. THIS IS NOT THE AMERICA ANY OF US GREW UP IN, THAT WE BELIEVE IN. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THE OTHER DAY, THREE DAYS AGO, WHAT HAPPENED? I WAS BEING INTRODUCED IN CLAREMONT, I BELIEVE IT WAS. A GUY, A WOMAN IS GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU. HER NAME WAS CHRISTIE. SHE LOOKED AT ME. SHE SAID, I WILL TELL MY STORY. SHE WAS A VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN VICTIM, BEATEN BY HER HUSBAND. SHE SAID SHE WAS ON THE STREET WITH A LITTLE BABY. NOWHERE TO GO. SHE PICKED UP A PAPER AND SHE LOOKED DOWN AND SAID, I DON'T KNOW THIS GUY. HE'S WRITING THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. HE WILL FIND ME A HOUSE AND HOME. GUESS WHAT? IT SAVED HER LIFE. SHE HAD MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ABUSE. THAT IMPACT ON HER CHILD, IT GOT HER OFF THE STREET. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHILDREN ON THE STREET ARE THERE BECAUSE THEIR MOTHERS ARE BEING ABUSED AND BATTERED. HOW MANY OF THEM ARE SUFFERING FROM POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS WITH US DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT? THE ACT I WROTE IS SITTING IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE NOT BEING PASSED BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GIVE THE BOYFRIENDS GUNS. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS. THIS IS WHY WE ARE ALL RUNNING, EVERYONE OF US. THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IT'S NOT ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE OTHER WAY. FOLKS, WE ARE BEING LED BY A PRESIDENT WHO HAS NO EMPATHY, NO SYMPATHY, WHO MOCKS PEOPLE, WHO MAKES FUN OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, WHO DOES EVERYTHING HE CAN TO BE MEAN. HE DOESN'T HAVE A SHRED OF DECENCY AND HIM. HE SPEAKS TO WOMEN IN SUCH DEGRADING TERMS. THAT'S NOT HOW YOU WERE RAISED HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THAT'S NOT HOW I WAS RAISED. THAT'S NOT THE AMERICA ANY OF US KNOW. IT DOESN'T REPRESENT NEW HAMPSHIRE VALUES EITHER. [CHEERS] I LOST A LOT IN MY LIFETIME LIKE YOU HAVE. I LOST MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. I LOST MY SON TO A LONG BATTLE WITH BRAIN CANCER. I WON'T STAND BY AND LOSE THIS ELECTION TO THIS MAN. WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. [CHEERS] THE CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY IS ON THE BALLOT. WE MUST DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. THERE IS NO CHOICE. THE MAN DOES NOT HAVE A SHRED OF DECENCY. WE HAVE TO STAND UP AGAINST BIGOTRY, HATRED, THE ABUSE OF POWER. THIS MAN DERIVES PEOPLE. IT'S UP TO YOU, AMERICA. ONLY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CAN DO IT. WE MUST DO IT NOW. STAND UP, TAKE IT BACK.

IT'S GREAT TO BE IN HUDSON. I, YOU KNOW, I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE. I'M HERE, I DON'T KNOW -- IF HE'S HERE, MY BUDDY, BUT HE SAYS SIMPLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN DELAWARE -- ONLY ABOUT 200,000 PEOPLE BIGGER THAN WE ARE, LARGER AND EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY. I WILL MAKE IT CLEAR. I'M VERY SIMPLY TO ASK FOR YOUR HELP. ASK. HEY, UNIVERSITY OF DOLLAR. -- OF DELAWARE. GREAT TO SEE YOU. BUT ASK FOR YOUR HELP. THANK YOU, MAN. I WAN TT TO THANK. SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. . IT IS A BIG DEAL. IT MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME THAT YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO STAND UP AND DO THIS. NO, I REALLY MEAN IT. IT MEANS A GREAT DEAL. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR ALL OF MY FRIENDS THAT ARE HERE, I WANT TO THANK STATE REP DAVID CODY, MICHAEL BRIAN. I WAS TOLD SOME WERE NOT ABLE TO BE HERE. AND BARBARA BLUE, ACTIVIST YEAR. -- ACTIVIST HERE. I ALSO WANTED THANK. THE OLD EXPRESSION. GOD MADE MAN, THEN HE MADE SOME FIREFIGHTERS AND THAT HE MADE THE PRESIDENT OF FIREFIGHTERS JIMMY MCALLISTER. IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS, AND LADIES. ALSO, AMBASSADOR TERRIE SHOEMAKER IS A GREAT FRIEND. AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW EVERYBODY IS BUT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. JIM, THANK YOU. JIM DEMURRERS IS HERE. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. LOOK, YOU KNOW, THE STORY MICHE LLE TELLS IS THE REASON WHY I GOT ENGAGED IN POLITICS IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU KNOW MY DAD USED TO HAVE A SAYING FOR REAL. FAMILY IS THE BEGINNING, THE MIDDLE AND THE END. THE WAY I LOOK AT HOW I THINK OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SHOULD ACT IS ACTINAG AGAIN, I HOPE, THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY. THAT IS ALL ABOUT ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE MY MOM AND DAD, MY SISTER AND MY BROTHERS WHO I WAS RAISED WITH. ORDINARY PEOPLE GIVEN HALF A CHANCE TO DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. BUT NEVER BEING PUT BEHIND THE 8BALL WHERE THEY DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO GET UP, DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO GET BACK. AS I LISTEN TO YOU, MICHELLE, I THOUGHT ABOUT THE SAME THOUGHTS I HSAD WHEN BEAU CAME HOME. WHEN THEY DIAGNOSED HIS CONDITION COMING HOME AFTER BEING IN IRAQ. I SAID, WHAT DO WE DO? GO HOME AND LOVE HIM. THEY SAID, HE WAS GOING TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR HE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE. HE CAME FROM IRAQ. A WAR HERO, BRONZE STAR. AND DIAGNOSED WITH A TERMINAL ILLNESS, STAGE IV NEAL BLASPHEMER. -- NEO BLASTOMA. WE ASKED THE DOCTOR. WHAT DO YOU DO? HE WAS GOING TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR. NO ONE WAS GOING TO RUN AGAINST HIM. HAVE HIM GO HOME AND RUN FOR GOVERNOR. BUT, DOC, YOU TOLD ME THERE IS NOTHING OUT THERE THERE. HE SAID, NO, BUT THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE. THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE. AND I DO REMEMBER, MICHELLE, YOU BROUGHT IT BACK. THAT THINKING TO MYSELF THAT WITHOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT INSURANCE I HAD, THAT THEY GAVE HIM JUST MONTHS. AND HE OUTLIVED THE TIME. HE LASTED 14 MONTHS, IN A LOT OF PAIN. I KEPT PICKING TO MYSELF FOR REAL, WHAT THE HELL WOULD I DO IF, IN FACT, THE INSURANCE, AND HE DID NOT HAVE WE DID NOT CHANGE THE LAW. THE INSURANCE COMPANY COULD SAY YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF YOUR COVERAGE NOW. LIVE THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF YOUR LIFE IN PAIN ON EUROPE. -- ON YOUR OWN. A LOT OF PEOPLE FACE THAT. A LOT OF AMERICANS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HAVE GONE THROUGH THINGS LIKE THAT. AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T MEAN IT IS ABOUT ME. I HAD A LOT OF HELP. PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH A LOT MORE THAN I HAVE GONE THROUGH, AND WITHOUT THE KIND OF HELP AND FAMILY FRIENDS THAT I HAD. BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT COMING IN A, ONE OF THE REASONS I FEEL SO, SO STRONGLY ABOUT PROTECTING AND EXPANDING OBAMACARE IS BECAUSE I'VE WATCHED MY OWN FAMILY HOW IT WORKS. AND HOW MANY OF YOU IN HERE HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO A TERMINAL DISEASE, PARTICULARLY CANCER, A LOVED ONE? RAISE YOUR HAND. ALMOST EVERY AUDIENCE I EVER SPEAK TO IN THE COUNTRY, YOU KNOW IT. THAT'S WHY I STARTED, THAT IS WHY THE PRESIDENT ALLOWED ME TO RUN A THING CALLED, WHEN WE DECIDED WE WERE GOING TO FOCUS ON CANCER AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AND THAT IS WHY AFTER -- I STARTED THE BIDEN FOUNDATION ON CANCER. BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN DO. WE CAN CHANGE MANY OF THESE 204 STRAINS OF CANCER THAT EXIST OUT THERE AND CHRONIC DISEASES, WE CAN CURE MANY OF THEM. MOST OF ALL, WHAT I FOUND, AND YOU FOUND, MICHELLE, YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE HOPE. IT DOES SPRING INTERNAL BECAUSE EVERY DAY THERE FINDING CURES FOR DISEASES THAT ARE NOT ANTICIPATED WHAT HAPPENS. BUT IT HAPPENS, IT TURNS THE CORNER. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THE THING I CARE ABOUT AND LIKE ABOUT MICHE LLE BEYOND HER TENACITY, SHE IS ALSO A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST. SHE KNOWS THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF -- WE NOW ONLY HAVE IN AMERICA ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST FOR EVERY 1507 KIDS. ALL THE EXPERTS SAY YOU NEED AT LEAST ONE FOR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 500 AND THE HIGH NUMBER 700 KIDS, BECAUSE THEY CAN PICK O UT EVERYTHING AND WE NEED MORE SCHOOL NURSES. WE NEED TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST AND SCHOOL HORSES. THEY CAN DETECT THINGS EARLY ON THAT FAMILIES ARE NOT ABLE TO PICK UP, PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE IN A LOW INCOME CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE DOES NOT MATTER YOUR COLOR, YOUR RACE, WHERE A LOT LESS MONEY IS SPENT IN THAT SCHOOL WHERE PEOPLE COMING FROM DISTRESSED BACKGROUNDS ECONOMICALLY. THAT'S WHY I DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF NOT ONLY FOR SO-CALLED TITLE I SCHOOLS BECAUSE YOU CAN DETECT IN A KID, EVERYBODY HAS FIGURED OUT, SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS CAN TELL YOU, IT IS NOT DRUG ABUSE IS NOT CAUSED BY, MENTAL UNLESS IS NOT -- DOES NOT CAUSE DRUG ABUSE. MENTAL ILLNESS IS CAUSED NOT BY DRUG ABUSE. IT OCCURS. IT CAUSES DRUG ABUSE. AND SO, WHEN YOU CAN IDENTIFY EARLY ON A KID, YOU CAN TELL WHEN THEY ARE 3, 4, 5 YEARS OLD, YOU CAN PICK IT UP, AND YOU CAN HELP THEM WITH THE ANXIETY THEY FEEL THAT RESULTS IN BEHAVIORS THAT ARE BEYOND THEIR CONTROL. AND SO, SCHOOL NURSES. I DON'T KNOW, IF YOU HAVE LIVED IN DISTRICTS WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN HIRE A FEW MORE SCHOOLTEACHERS, OR SCHOOL NURSES OR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS OR SOCIAL WORKERS. BECAUSE FOLKS, HERE IS WHAT WORRIES ME THE MOST. WHAT IS GOING ON NOW AS WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO DOES NOT THINK IN TERMS OF PEOPLE. HE DOESN'T THINK IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUALS. I HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY AT ALL OVER THE STATE. THE THINK ABOUT YOU ALL UP HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IS YOU BASICALLY NO ONE ANOTHER, YOU KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS, YOU CAN SENSE WHEN THINGS ARE WRONG. YOU CAN SENSE WHEN THINGS ARE OUT OF CONTROL. WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE AMERICAN CHARACTER, THE VERY CHARACTER OF THIS COUNTRY IS ON THE BALLOT TODAY. IT'S GOING TO BE DECIDED IN 2020 IN NOVEMBER. IT IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE. WHAT DO WE CARE ABOUT? WHAT OF THE REASONS WHY WE ARE DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING? WHAT IS THE LAWS WE ARE SEEKING TO PASS, AND WHAT IS THEIR PURPOSE? HOW MUCH WILL THEY COST AND ARE ABLE TO GET THEM DONE? FOLKS, AS I GO AROUND THE STATE AND AROUND THE NATION AND WORKING ON ROPE LINES, AND PEOPLE COMING UP TO ME. I WAS IN CLAREMONT WEEK AGO, I GUESS IT WAS. A GUY SAYS, CAN I TALK TO? I SAID, YEAH, I'LL GO THROUGH THIS ROPE LINE. I HAD STAFF TAKEN IN THE BACK. I WALKED BACK. HE WAS SHAKING. I'M GOING TO LOSE MY JOB, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, TO TELL MY FAMILY. WE'RE GOING TO LOSE OUR HOUSE. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WHAT DO I DO? AND I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING HE ASKED ME WHAT COULD HE DO. I TOLD HIM A STORY BAG AS HE HEADED HEARD -- HE HAD HEARD IT. WHEN I WAS A KID MY DAD HAD TO MAKE THE SAME DECISION. MY DAD, I REMEMBER WALKING UP THE LONGEST WALK A PARENT HAS TO MAKE UP A SHORT FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO TELL THEIR CHILD YOU CANNOT LIVE HERE ANY MORE. WE HAVE TO MOVE. DADDY OR MOMMY DOES NOT HAVE A JOB. YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH GRANDPA OR GRANDMA IF YOU HAVE ONE. MY DAD MADE THAT WALK IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. BUT HE SAID, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK, JOEY, BECAUSE HE BELIEVED IT WOULD BE. HE BELIEVE IN THOSE DAYS, BACK IN THE 1950'S, IF GIVEN HAVE A CHANCE, HE COULD MAKE IT, AS LONG AS WE MOVE WITH THE -- TO A PLACE WHERE THERE WERE JOBS. HE MOVED BACK TO DELAWARE WHERE HE LIVED FROM THIRD TO 11TH GRADE AND HE GOT A JOB. TOOK HIM ABOUT THREE YEARS TO BE ABLE TO BUY A HOUSE FOR US, BUT WE FINALLY GOT A HOUSE, A THREE-BEDROOM HOUSE. FOUR KIDS AND GRAND POP LIVING WITH US BUT IT WAS OK. HE BELIEVE IT TODAY. HOW MANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS WHO HAD TO MAKE THAT LONG WALK AND YOU KNOW MADE THAT LONG WALK OR YOU'VE MADE THAT LONG WALK, HOW MANY OF YOU OUT THERE KNOW TO BE ABLE TO SAY IT IS GOING TO BE OK? WE DON'T THINK IT IS GOING TO BE OK ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY LOOK AROUND. THE WORKING-CLASS IS GETTING CLOBBERED. THE BOTTOM HAS FALLEN OUT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE ARE NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD. THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE LISTED AS MIDDLE-CLASS THINKER CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE THE SAME STANDARD OF LIVING THEY HAVE. WHAT IS WRONG WITH US? WHAT IS GOING ON NOW? WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? WHAT IS, YOU KNOW, WOODROW WILSON SAID A PARTY IS WORTH NO MORE THAN THAT FOR WHICH IT STANDS. WHAT DO WE STAND FOR? IT IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THE PEOPLE, GOOD, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE GOT AN EVEN SHOT. WE'RE NOT GETTING AN EVEN SHOT NOW. I SEE ITA ALL THE TIME. PEOPLE COMING UP UP TO ME. EVEN THE PRESS HE USED TO SAY, HE'S HUGGING WOMEN. GUESS WHAT? THEY ARE HUGGING ME -- NOT BECAUSE THEY LOVE ME. THEY ARE HUGGING BECAUSE THEY ARE FRIGHTENED. THE HUNDREDS OF STORIES I HAVE BEEN TOLD. A WOMAN WALKED UP TO ME NOT LONG AGO -- IT WAS A MAN WHO GAVE ME A HUG. HIS NAME WAS GENE. HE HAD TERMINAL CANCER IN YOUR STATE. I SAID, GENE, WHAT YOU DOING HERE? I HAVE PROSTATE CANCER, IT IS TERMINAL. I CAN'T MAKE IT. I'VE HAD MY SHOCKED BACK TO LIFE 8 TIMES. BECAUSE OF CARDIAC ISSUES IN ADDITION I SAID, WHY ARE YOU HERE? YOU SHOULD BE TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF. HIS RESPONSE WAS THAT HE SAID, I'M HERE BECAUSE I GOT TO HAVE SOME PURPOSE. GOT TO HAVE SOME PURPOSE. AND HE SAID BUT THANK GOD, AT LEAST I HAVE SOME COVERAGE. BUT THIS IS A GUY. HIS WIFE. GOT TO HAVE PURPOSE. I'M IN TROUBLE. I'VE STAGE IV CANCER. AND NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT EVEN KNOWS THOSE PEOPLE EXIST OUT THERE? THERE FOR THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS. HE'S NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT APPEARING WE DO NOT HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. I WAS INTRODUCED TO -- I GUESS IT WAS FOUR, FIVE SIX DAYS AGO.. I CAN'T REMEMBER I AM LOSING TRACK OF TIME. BY A WOMAN NAMED CHRISSY. I WAS IN CONCORD. I HADN'T MET HER BEFORE. AS SHE TOLD THE TALE OF BEING VICTIMIZED BY HER HUSBAND. BEING BATTERED MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY BY HIM. THE ONLY WAY SHE COULD GET OUT WITH HER YOUNG BABY, SON, WAS TO LEAVE THE HOUSE. SHE WAS HOMELESS. HOMELESS FOR A LONG TIME. DIDN'T HAVE A CAR. SHE AID, THEN I GOT SOME HOPE. I SAW NEWSPAPER. THEY SAY THERE IS A GUY NAMED BIDEN. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT ME. HE WAS WRITING THIS THING CALLED THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT TO GET HOUSING. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHILDREN ON THE STREET ARE THERE BECAUSE, BECAUSE THEIR MOTHERS ARE BATTERED WOMEN. DO YOU REALIZE THE OTHER PORTION OF THOSE WHO ARE KIDS KICKED OUT OF THEIR OWN HOMES BECAUSE THEY ARE GAY OR LESBIAN, NOT EXCEPTED BY THEIR FAMILY. THESE ARE CHILDREN. THEN SHE WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HOW SHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT. HOW SHE WORK TO WAY THROUGH AND HOW SHE GOT BACK. BUT HERE WE ARE. AS I SPEAK TO YOU, THE VERY LAW I WROTE WITH MY OWN PAW, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, WHICH NOBODY WANTED TO SUPPORT INITIALLY AND WE GOT IT DONE, IS CHANGING THE LIVES OF PEOPLE BUT GUESS WHAT? [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. BUT THAT IS NOT WHY I SAY IT. HERE'S THE POINT. BECAUSE OF TRUMP AND THE GUN LOBBY IT MAY BE OVER. IT HAS TO BE REAUTHORIZED. IT'S PASSED THE HOUSE OVERWHELMINGLY. IT IS IN THE SENATE SITTING ON MCCONNELL'S DESK. YOU KNOW WHY THEY WON'T PASS IT? BECAUSE I PUT IN PROVISIONS SAYING AN ABUSER CANNOT OWN A WEAPON. HE HAS A STAY ORDER TO STAY AWAY FROM HIS WIFE OR HIS GIRL FOR YOU CANNOT OWN A WEAPON. HE SHOULD BE DENIED. GUESS WHAT? [APPLAUSE] BUT HERE'S THE POINT. I WAS ABLE TO GET THAT PASS FOR EVERYBODY EXCEPT THERE IS A BOYFRIEND EXCEPTION. IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BABY BY THE ABUSER, YOU AREN'T MARRIED TO THE ABUSER, JUST A BOYFRIEND ABUSING YOU, HE WAS NOT DENIED THE RIGHT TO OWN A GUN. GUESS WHAT? MOST WOMEN DIE IN THOSE SITUATIONS GETTING THEIR BRAINS BLOWN UP BY SOMEONE HOLDING A GUN. IT'S BEING HELD UP BECAUSE TRUMP IS OWNED BY THE NRA. THEY WILL NOT LET IT PASS. IT'S WRONG! IT'S WRONG! IT'S WRONG! [APPLAUSE] ONE MORE EXAMPLE. TWO DAYS AGO IN MANCHESTER, ACTUALLY, NOT TWO DAYS AGO, SATURDAY, IT SEEMS LIKE TWO DAYS DAYS AGO. SATURDAY, JILL AND MY DECEASED SON'S CHILDREN WERE WITH ME. WE WERE AT A FEED THE CHILDREN PROGRAM IN MANCHESTER. STANDING IN A PARKING LOT WITH HUNDREDS AND HUNDRED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. HANDING OUT BREAD, FOOD. LITTLE KIDS, WAS 22 DEGREES AND THE WIND WASS BLOWING HARD. IT WAS COLD AS HELL. AND PEOPLE ARE STANDING IN LINE. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THIS WHOLE SITE. WOMEN AND CHILDREN BEING HANDED BOXES SO THEY CAN WALK ALONG THE TABLES WHO ARE STANDING THERE HANDING OUT BRED AND FOOD-- BREAD AND FOOD. KIDS CANNOT EVEN PICK THE BOXES UP. TAKE AN EXTRA LOAF. I DON'T NEED IT. SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT NEED IT. AND THIS PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, AS I SPEAK, IS CUTTING FOOD STAMPS! WHAT IN GOD'S NAME IS HAPPENING TO US? THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT MAKES ME ANGRY. THE IDEA THAT IN A COUNTRY AS WEALTHY AS WE ARE YOU GOT KIDS -- ONE OF THE ORGANIZERS THEY DO IT RAIN OR SHINE, GOD L OVE THEM. GUESS WHAT? IT WAS SO COLD. ONE OF THE ORGANIZERS GAVE ME A STOCKING CAP. I LOOKED AT IT I SAW THIS LITTLE KID. THIS HAS A YOUNG MAN AND A SWEATER. NO GLOVES. FREEZING. I'M THINKING, WHAT IN GOD'S NAME IS GOING ON? I DID WHAT YOU DID. I GAVE THE HATE TO HIM -- THE HAT TO HIM. BUT SO MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WE'RE CUTTING FOOD STAMPS? NOW CALLED THE SNAP PROGRAM. FOLKS, THERE'S SO MUCH WRONG THAT'S SO EASY TO FIX. YOU IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, YOU KNOW ONE ANOTHER. YOU CAN FEEL THE PAIN OF YOUR NEXT OUR NEIGHBOR, YOU KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING SOMETIMES. AND YOU REACH OUT. YOU ARE NOT DISTANT. FOLKS, THIS ELECTION, AMERICA'S CHARACTER IS ON THE PALETTE. -- THE BALLOT. THE CHARACTER OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING IS ON THE BALLOT. FOLKS, WE GOT TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK IN A BAD, BAD WAY. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, I -- ALL THESE PROBLEMS ARE WITHIN OUR CAPACITY TO SOLVE. NOT HURTING ANYBODY, NOT DENYING ANYBODY AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. WE HAVE OVER $1, 600 BILLION TAX LOOPHOLES, MONEY NOT COLLECTED. WE GIVE PEOPLE BREAKS FOR RESOURCES. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHAT ARE WE DOING? FOLKS, LOOK, THIS ISN'T THE AMERICA THAT I WAS RAISED IN. BEING LED BY A PRESIDENT WHO HAS NO EMPATHY. NO COMPASSION. DOESN'T DEMONSTRATE A SHRED OF DECENCY. I READING -- I REALLY MEAN THIS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT REPUBLICAN-DEMOCRAT, THIS IS WAY BEYOND THAT. WHEN I SAW COLONEL VINDMAN BEING PHYSICALLY ESCORTED, A HERO, PHYSICALLY ESCORTED OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, BY GUARDS. WHEN I SAW ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT, HIGH-RANKING PEOPLE THAT TESTIFIED BEFORE THE HOUSE UNDER OATH AND ANSWERED HONESTLY,. NO, BIDEN DID NOT DO ANYTHING WRONG. BIDEN IS AN HONORABLE MAN. ALL LINED UP AND FIRED. AS WE SPEAK, READ THE PAPERS TODAY, LISTEN TO THE NEWS. AGAINST THE ADVICE OF ALL OF HIS POLITICAL ADVISERS. THIS IS VENOMOUS. FOLKS, THIS ISN'T AMERICA. WHEN THIS PRESIDENT COMMENTED ON THOSE WARRIORS IN IRAQ WHO AT THE OTHER END OF THE MISSILE ATTACK IN IRAN, IN A SENSELESS CONFLICT HE STARTED. DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN INJURY, THOSE ARE JUST HEADACHES. HE STOOD BEFORE THEM AND CALLED THEM LOSERS, TO THEIR FACE. BABIES. THIS IS A GUY WHO, IN FACT, EMBRACES WHITE SUPREMACISTS. WHEN A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED DOWN IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHEN THOSE FOLKS, CLOSE YOUR EYES, REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAW. FOLKS WALKING OUT OF FEELS CARRYING TORCHES WITH VEINS BUL GING, SHOUTING ANTI-SEMITIC SAYINGS, THE SAME ONE SHOUTED IN GERMANY IN THE 1930'S. A YOUNG WOMAN GETS KILLED. THEY ASK HIM TO COMMENT. HE SAID, THEY ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. THIS IS A GUY WHO BOWS DOWN TO VLADIMIR PUTIN, SAYS BEFORE THE WORLD, I BELIEVE, PUTIN, HE HAD NO REASON TO DO ANYTHING IN OUR ELECTIONS. WHY WOULD HE DO THAT AFTER 18 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TOLD HIM THEY DID. TALK ABOUT WOMEN AND DEGRADING -- DEMEANING, DEMONIZING. MAKING FUN OF PEOPLE OF DISABILITIES. MIMICKING THEM. LOOK, THIS IS NOT THE AMERICA I KNOW. THIS IS NOT THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN. YOU KNOW, I KNOW, YOU TALK ABOUT LOSING. GUESS WHAT? LIKE MANY OF YOU I HAVE LOST A LOT IN MY LIFETIME. LOST A WIFE AND A DAUGHTER IN A CAR ACCIDENT. I LOST MY SON TO CANCER. BUT I'LL BE DAMNED IF I'M GOING TO STAND BY AND LOSE MY COUNTRY. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. PERIOD. PERIOD. PERIOD. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN! SO, FOLKS -- [APPLAUSE] TIME TO STAY UP AND GET READY TO -- I'M GOING TO STOP TALKING BECAUSE I WANT TO HEAR WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND. I WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. BUT FOLKS, THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER, I SWEAR TO GOD. I'M OPTIMISTIC IF WE GET RID OF THIS GUY BY OUR ABILITY TO PUT THIS COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER ON A NEW PATH AND LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD IN A WAY WE HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE IN A LONG TIME. MY MOTHER, SHE WOULD SAY JOEY, HUSH UP AND TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. ANYBODY GOT QUESTIONS, RAISE YOUR HAND. DO WE HAVE FOLKS WITH MICS AROUND HERE?

IT TAKES IN THE NORMA'S AMOUNT OF COURAGE TO GET UP AND DO WHAT YOU SAID BUT GUESS WHAT, YOU KNOW FROM YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU GIVE HOPE TO. ALMOST EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICA HAS GONE THROUGH WHAT YOUR FAMILY HAS GONE THROUGH, WHAT YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH. VIRTUALLY EVERY FAMILY, ANYTIME, ANYPLACE WHERE THEY HAVE NOT HAD SOMEBODY OR FOUND THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY WERE IN DESPERATE NEED OF HELP BECAUSE OF ALCOHOL OR DRUGS OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT CAPTURE THEM.

[APPLAUSE] GUESS WHO ELSE IS IN MANCHESTER TONIGHT, DONALD TRUMP. [CROWD BOOS] WHAT A COINCIDENCE. [LAUGHTER] WHAT A COINCIDENCE. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE HE IS FOLLOWING ME AROUND. HE SEEMS VERY INTERESTED AT WHO THE NOMINEES OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL BE. [SHOUTING] I WONDER WHY HE IS SO INTERESTED. I WONDER WHY HE IS SO INTERESTED. I GUESS I'VE BEEN THE OBJECT FOR SO LONG NOW. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T CARE HOW MANY TIMES HE COMES TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, HE WILL NOT WIN NO HAMPSHIRE IN NOVEMBER. [CHEERING] AND BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW THE OLD JOKE BILLY SHAHEEN, WHERE THE HECK ARE YOU, BILLY, BILLY SAYS HEY JOE, LET'S TELL THEM EXACTLY WHAT TO THINK, RIGHT BILLY. HE SAYS I'M HERE TO ASK YOU, I NEED YOUR HELP AND THANK YOU FOR OFFERING IT. STICK WITH ME 24 MORE HOURS AND I PROMISE YOU WE WILL DO JUST FINE HEADING SOUTH AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WE WILL WIN THIS NOMINATION. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW, I ALREADY , WEIRD HE GOT RID OF A PRESIDENT WHO CALLS GENERAL TO THEIR FACES, LOSERS AND BABIES. I KNOW WHO I AM, I'M READY TO GET THEM OUT OF PRESIDENT BIRD AT YOUR EROTIC BRAIN INJURY, A HEADACHE, A PRESIDENT WHO HAS RUSH LIMBAUGH, A A DECORATED WAR HERO OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE FOR TELLING THE TRUTH AND HAS COURAGE IN EXPORTING HIM OUT. ARE YOU READY TO GET RID OF A PRESIDENT WHO IS TRYING TO DESTROY OBAMACARE WHO DOES NOT BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE, KICKING MILLIONS AND KIDS OF PARENTS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS, I KNOW I AM. [CHEERING] ARE YOU READY TO GET RID OF A PRESIDENT THAT BUILDS WALLS, PUT KIDS IN CAGES, CALLS AND WHITE SUPREMACIST, I AM DAMN WELL READY TO GET RID OF THEM. [CHEERING] ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. ENOUGH ABOUT TRUMP, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE . I THINK IT IS TIME TO GET A PRESIDENT THAT WILL DEFEND AND PROTECT OBAMACARE. IF YOU SELL THE PAPER TODAY HE INTRODUCED HIS BUDGET, TRUMP SLASHES MEDICAID IN THE SAFETY NET BY OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS. [CROWD BOOS] ANDY CUTS OBAMACARE IF NOT PROCESSED, A LOT OF FOLKS ARE RUNNING AND WANT TO TAKE AWAY OBAMACARE, I DO NOT, I WANT TO BUILD ON OBAMACARE. [APPLAUSE] A MEDICARE -LIKE OPTION, PUBLIC OPTION. MY CLAIM WILL LOWER DEDUCTIBLES, LOWER CO-PAYS, LOWER DRUG COST AND EXPAND COVERAGE TO EVERYBODY. AND IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD IT YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET IT. THIS IS HOW WE WILL TAKE THE NEXT STEP IN HEALTHCARE. AND I GET IT DONE. I WAS THERE ON THE WAR THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, I GOT THE BOATS AND GOT EVERY DEMOCRAT OUT THERE TO VOTE IN PAST WITH A SINGLE REPUBLICAN VOTE. AND I CAN GET MY JOB DONE WITHOUT IN FACT FORCING ANYONE OFF YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE IF THAT'S ONE YOU WANT, AND YOU HAVE NEGOTIATED . WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS, I THINK THE NEXT PRESIDENT WHO WILL TAKE ON THE CRISIS OVER TIME, CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S THE SINGLE GREATEST THREAT TO HUMANITY. ALL THE WAY BACK IN 1986 I INTRODUCED THE FIRST CLIMATE CHANGE BILL OVERPASS. THEY SAID IT WAS A GAME CHANGER. AS VICE PRESIDENT I JOINED WITH JOHN KERRY TO GET THE CLIMATE AGREEMENT DONE. THE FIRST THING I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT IS REJOINED INNKEEPER COMMITMENT. [CHEERING] PRESIDENT OBAMA, WE WERE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT OF CLEAN ENERGY IN ALL OF AMERICAN HISTORY, BECAUSE WE CAME TO THE RECOVERY ACT. A 900 BILLION-DOLLAR BILL HE PUT ME IN CHARGE OF, WE INVESTED $90 BILLION IN CLEAN ENERGY, BROUGHT DOWN THE PIPE UNDER PRICE OF SOLAR, BROUGHT DOWN THE PRICE OF WIND, AND COLD. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL MAKE SURE WE GET TO NET-ZERO BEFORE 2050 AND WE WILL INVEST $400 BILLION IN 2000 TWICE WHAT WE INVESTED. TO MAKE WE SURE WE HAVE CLEAN ENERGY. MAKE SURE THAT EVERY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT, HIGHWAYS, SCHOOLS, BUILDINGS, FROM THIS POINT ON IS A GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. 500,000 CHARGING STATIONS ON THE NEW HIGHWAYS. OWNING THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE MARKET, CREATING 10 MILLION NEW JOBS NOT $15 AN HOUR BUT $50 AN HOUR WITH BENEFITS. I THINK IT'S TIME WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO HAS COURAGE TO STAND UP. [CHEERING] I'M THE ONLY PERSON RUNNING, A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE RUNNING, I'M THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S BEEN THE NRA NATIONALLY. I HAVE BEATEN THEM TWICE. I'M THE GUY THAT GOT THE BRADY BILL PASSED IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. I GOT THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN FOR TEN YEARS AND I LIMITED THE NUMBER OF BULLET YOU CAN HAVE IN A MAGAZINE, NOT 15, NOT 100 ROUNDS, THAT KILL PEOPLE INSTANTLY, DO REALIZE HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE IN THE FIRST MINUTE WHEN SOMEONE WALKS IN WITH A MAGAZINE THAT HAS 100 ROUNDS OR 50 ROUNDS, IT IS UNSIGHTLY, IT IS IMMORAL. I HAVE BEATEN THE NRA BEFORE AND I PROMISE I WILL BEAT THEM AGAIN. [CHEERING] BUT THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH. I AM GOING TO GET RID OF MAYBE THE WORST VOTES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. THAT IS, GIVING IMMUNITY TO GUN MANUFACTURERS FOR THE DEATHS, CHAOS AND THEY HAVE CAUSED. [CHEERING] MORE PEOPLE DIE IN OUR STREETS THE LAST DECADE OR MORE, MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING IN THE STREETS, MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING IN MASS SHOOTINGS THAN ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD. THERE ARE SOME IN THIS RACE GIVING IMMUNITY TO GUN MANY FACTORS IS A GOOD IDEA, THEY ARE BUT DEAD WRONG, WE DON'T PROTECT THE TOBACCO COMPANIES, THEY DON'T GET IMMUNITY, IMAGINE IF WE DIDN'T, THEY WERE PROTECTED. IMAGINE IF THE DRUG MANUFACTURERS WERE PROTECTED LIKE THE GUN METER FRACTURES. IMAGINE. IMAGINE THE OIL COMPANIES CANNOT BE SUED FOR THE DAMAGE THAT THEY DO LIKE GUN MANUFACTURERS. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, WE SURE SHOULDN'T PROTECT THE GUN MANUFACTURERS. CAUGHT. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, THOSE DAYS WILL BE OVER AND THEY WILL PAY AN ENORMOUS PRICE. I THINK IT'S TIME WE HAD A PRESIDENT THAT UNDERSTOOD THE WALL STREET BANKERS AND CEO DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY, WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE, MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE, THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS. AND I MIGHT ADD, UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS, UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. [CHEERING] IT IS TIME WE REWARD WORK IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT JUST WEALTH. IT IS TIME WE STOP TREATING PEOPLE , IT'S TIME WE STOP THE MASSIVE TAX CUTS FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY AND STAND UP FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS, IS TIME WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO STOOD UP FOR AMERICAN VALUES ON THE WORLD STAGE. [CHEERING] REBUILDER ALLIANCE, THEY ARE CRUMBLING AROUND THE WORLD IN ASIA AS WELL AS IN EUROPE. WE NEED TO REBUILD OUR ALLIANCES. I'VE DONE IT BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPANDING NATO. AND I WILL REINFORCE IT AS A PRESIDENT. AND I WILL NOT BOW DOWN TO VLADIMIR PUTIN, HE KNOWS ME. [CHEERING] AND I WILL BE SENDING KIM JONG-UN ANY LOVE LETTERS. LOOK, BELIEVE ME THE WORLD DICTATORS, THEIR OWN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THE PRESIDENT STANDS BEFORE THE ENTIRE WORLD AND THE CAMERA WAS ON HIS LEFT AND HE SAYS WHY WOULD HE INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTION, BECAUSE 18 INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TOLD YOU HE DID. THAT'S WHY. AND WHY WOULD YOU THINK HE WOULD NOT ENGAGE TO TRY TO AFFECT OUR ELECTION? WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT DOES TO OUR STANDING AROUND THE WORLD. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT DOES AS THE OTHER INTELLIGENCE YOU WORK WITH. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT DOES AND HOW MUCH THEY TRUST HER JUDGMENT WHEN THAT OCCURRED. LOOK, YOU GOT IT KID. [LAUGHTER] THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. WHAT YOU HAVE DONE MATTERS. POWERFUL SPECIAL INTERESTS LIKE THE NRA MATTERS, WORKING WITH THE WORLD LEADERS WHO KNOW WE WILL KEEP OUR WORD MATTERS. FIGHTING CONGRESS FROM HEALTHCARE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, TO EDUCATION, THEY MATTER. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAY EXPERIENCE DOES NOT MATTER, WELL, I THINK IT DOES. IT'S A REASON WHY I AM RUNNING. I HAVE BEEN THERE. CAUGHT. AND I THINK WE CAN DO A WHOLE LOT OF BOTH RIGHT NOW, EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM. HERE'S WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER, THE SIMPLE TRUTH ABOUT THIS COUNTRY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE NEVER EVER EVER LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN. WE GIVE THEM A CHANCE AND WE GIVE THEM AN EVEN SHOT, THEY WILL NOT LET US DOWN NOW. AND WE ARE SO READY, THE COUNTRY IS SO READY, THINK ABOUT IT, I REALLY MEAN IT. INCLUDING REPUBLICAN VOTERS, INDEPENDENT VOTERS, DEMOCRATIC VOTERS BECAUSE ABANDONED HAS BEEN RIPPED OFF BY THIS PRESIDENT. HE HAS SHOWN THAT UGLY OF WHAT HE'S ABOUT. I HAVE SAID FOR THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCE MY CANDIDACY, I BELIEVE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE COUNTRY. I WROTE A PIECE FOR THE ATLANTIC ATLANTIC, CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAW IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. THOSE FOLKS COME OUT CARRYING TORCHES, THEY WERE ON TELEVISION, VEINS BULGING CARRYING NOT THE BANNERS AND STANDING IN THE STREETS OF GERMANY IN THE 30s, THE COMPANY BY THE KU KLUX KLAN AND WHITE SUPREMACIST AND THE YOUNG GIRL WAS KILLED IN THE PRESS ASKED HIM, MR. PRESIDENT WHAT DO YOU THINK AND HE SAID SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES HAS EVER SAID, HE MADE A MORAL EQUIVALENCY SAID WE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. IT STUNNED AMERICA AND SHOCK THE WORLD, SPONTANEOUSLY. OUR ALLIES AND OTHER COUNTRIES SPOKE ABOUT HIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON IN AMERICA. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S ENORMOUS DAMAGE, I BELIEVE FROM THAT MOMENT ON WHEN I ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE IN A FIGHT FOR AMERICA, EVEN MORE SO TODAY, EVERYTHING THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR, EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE, IS SOLID STEAK, OUR CORE VALUES, OUR LEADERSHIP ON THE WORLD IS AT STAKE. OUR VERY DEMOCRACY AT STAKE. LOOK THIS YEAR SAID CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT. AMERICA'S CHARACTER. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM DON'T WANT THEIR KIDS GROWING UP I CAN. ASK ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS WHO SUPPORT HIM, YOU WANT YOUR KID TO GROW UP I CAN, THE SAME VALUE SET. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO HE IS, WE HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW WHO WE ARE. [CHEERING] FOLKS, WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. [CHEERING] WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. UNITY OVER DIVISION. [CHEERING] INFRACTION OF ACCRUAL TO. [CHEERING] AND TRUTH OVERLIES. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW, WE HAVE LOST SO MUCH WITH DONALD TRUMP IN PRESIDENT, WE HAVE LOST TIME TO DO A CLIMATE CRISIS, WE HAVE LOST THE TRUST OF OUR ALLIES, WE LOST THE RESPECT OF MUCH OF THE WORLD, BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. LIKE A LOT OF YOU, I LOST A LOT OF MY LIFETIME AS YOU HAVE, I LOST A LOT. BUT I TELL YOU, I'D BE DM DIFF I'M GOING TO STAND BY AND LOSES COUNTRY TO DONALD TRUMP FOR MORE YEARS. [CHEERING] THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO. NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO TOGETHER. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS TIME WE LIFT OUR HEADS UP AND REMEMBER WHO WE ARE, WE HAVE NEVER EVER EVER SET A GOAL THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHEN WE DONE IT TOGETHER AND ACT WITH AMERICAN VALUES TO KNOW WHO WE ARE, NEVER, NEVER EVER. SO LET'S GET UP AND TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY, TAKE IT BACK NOW. GOD BUSHY WELL AND MAY GOD PROTECT HER CHILDREN. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

I SPOKE TO OUR FOLKS UP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND THEY DID A GOOD JOB. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, THE PEOPLE OF NEVADA ARE WATCHING, AND I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, WE PRAISE THEIR DIVERSITY AS A STATE, AND I WILL BE OUT THERE SEEING THEM SOON. TONIGHT, THOUGH, WE JUST HEARD OF THE FIRST TWO OF 50 STATES. TWO OF THEM. NOT ALL THE NATION, NOT HALF THE NATION, NOT A QUARTER OF THE NATION, NOT 10%. TWO. NOW, WHERE I COME FROM THAT'S THE OPENING BELL, NOT THE CLOSING BELL, AND THE FIGHT TO END DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY IS JUST BEGINNING. JUST BEGINNING. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IOWA HAS SPOKEN, BUT WE NEED TO HEAR FROM NEVADA, SOUTH CAROLINA, SUPER TUESDAY AND BEYOND. UP UNTIL NOW, WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THE MOST COMMITTED CONSTITUENTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY! AND THE FASTEST-GROWING SEGMENT OF SOCIETY, THE LATINO COMMUNITY! I WANT YOU ALL TO THINK OF A NUMBER. 99.9%, THAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS WHO HAVE NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE IN AMERICA. ONE MORE NUMBER. 99.8%, THE PERCENT OF LATINO VOTERS WHO HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE. SO WHEN YOU HEAR ALL THESE EXPERTS, CABLE TV TALKERS TALKING ABOUT THE RACE, TELL THEM IT AIN'T OVER, MAN, WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. [APPLAUSE] OUR VOTES COUNT, TOO. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE TAKE THIS ELECTION AWAY. I'VE SAID IT A MILLION TIMES, YOU CAN'T BE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE AND CAN'T WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION WITHOUT OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FROM BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS. IT IS SIMPLE. IT'S A NATURAL FACT. IT IS TRUE, ABSOLUTELY TRUE. YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO WON AGAINST INCUMBENTS, FROM JIMMY CARTER TO A GUY NAMED CLINTON, A GUY NAMED OBAMA, MY GOOD FRIEND, GUESS WHAT? THEY HAD OVERWHELMING AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPPORT. WITHOUT IT, NOBODY'S EVER WON. REALLY. AND YOU ALL KNOW. MORE IMPORTANT, YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WIN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT WITHOUT BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS. TOO OFTEN YOUR LOYALTY AND SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT TO THIS PARTY HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED. I'VE NEVER ONCE IN MY CAREER TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED, AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD AS A BIDEN THAT I NEVER, EVER WILL. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT OTHER CANDIDATES WILL DO IN THE FUTURE, THE TENDENCY IS TO LOOK AT THE PAST. I LEFT A LAW FIRM WHEN I WAS A KID WITH A GREAT JOB, AT A FANCY LAW FIRM, TO BECOME A PUBLIC DEFENDER, TO FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY I USED TO WORK IN, ON THE EAST SIDE, BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD A LAWYER. ON THE COUNTY COUNSEL, I FOUGHT AGAINST REDLINING. IN THE U.S. SENATE, I PASSED AN EXTENSION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. AND I HAD THE BACK OF A GREAT PRESIDENT NAMED BARACK OBAMA FOR EIGHT YEARS. [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, WE INCREASED ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT. GIVEN A CHANCE, THEY DO JUST AS WELL AS ANYONE ELSE, QUITE FRANKLY BETTER, AND THEY BUILT NEIGHBORHOODS, THEY BUILT COMMUNITIES! WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE FEDERAL POPULATION. SPEAKING OF HBCU'S , I GOT $70 BILLION COMING TO HBCU'S, NOT A JOKE. MINORITY UNIVERSITIES. WE SAVED THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, PASSED OBAMACARE, STOPPED INSURANCE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND ON TOP OF THAT, WE BUILT AN I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU NEED BEST. I LISTEN. YOU ALL KNOW WHAT YOU NEED BEST. WE DON'T LISTEN ENOUGH. WE TAKE FOR GRANTED. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED. WHAT YOUR FAMILIES NEED. WE NEED TO DEFEND AND BUILD ON OBAMACARE. TRUMP WON'S TO GET RID OF IT. EVEN SOME OF THE FOLKS IN MY OWN OUTFIT WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY. BUT I WILL NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN. I WAS PROUD TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VICE PRESIDENT. AND TO BECOME A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND. MY GRANDDAUGHTERS AND HIS DAUGHTERS ARE BEST BUDDIES. I WAS NEVER PROUDER THAN THE DAY WE PASSED OBAMACARE. WE WILL EXPAND THAT. WE WILL GET RID OF ALL THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT HAVE CURTAILED IT. WE WILL INCREASE FUNDING INTO RESEARCH FOR FINDING CURES. IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THERE IS A INCREDIBLE DISPARITY. IT IS SINFUL. IT IS AN INDICTMENT OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. EVERY CHILD HAS THE SAME CAPACITY WHEN THEY ARE BORN. EVERYONE OF THEM HAS THE SAME CAPACITY. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR ZIP CODE OR INCOME LEVEL. I WILL PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS. WE WILL GIVE TEACHERS THE PAYRAISE THEY NEED. WE ARE ALREADY SHORT. WHO WILL GET SHORTCHANGED? YOU'RE DARN RIGHT THEY ARE. WE WILL GIVE OUR TEACHERS A PAY RAISE. WE WILL AND ALL PRIVATE PRISONS. NO MORE JAIL TIME FOR ADDICTION. BUILD MORE TREATMENT FACILITIES. MAKE SURE MARIJUANA CONVICTIONS, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LEGALLY SAY, I HAVE NEVER BEEN ARRESTED. LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS. ALL OF THESE STATES ARE OUT THERE LEGALIZING MARIJUANA. WE SHOULD TAKE A BIG CHUNK OF THOSE PROFITS AND PUT AN END TO PRISONS. WE NEED TO BE A COUNTRY OF SECOND CHANCES. THINK ABOUT IT. WE ALL TALK ABOUT SECOND CHANCES. BUT WHAT DO WE DO? WE SAY YOU ARE DENIED ALL OF THE THINGS THAT CAN HELP YOU. WE WILL GIVE YOU $25 AND A BUS TICKET. WE NEED TO ELIMINATE ALL OF THOSE BARRIERS TO SUCCESS. PEOPLE COMING OUT OF PRISON AND COMING BACK FROM SERVING THEIR TIME, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET PELL GRANTS. HOUSING. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT GIVE THEM A CHANCE. WHILE THEY ARE THERE, WE SHOULD BE TEACHING THEM SKILLS. IT MAKES NO SENSE. WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY AND A GREAT PEOPLE. THE GREATEST WORKERS IN THE WORLD. WE SHOULD GET PAID LIKE WE ARE THE GREATEST WORKERS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE TOO MANY FAMILIES WORKING THEIR TAILS OFF. TOO MANY PEOPLE I KNOW DO WHAT MY DAD DID. WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT. PEOPLE ARE HAVING TROUBLE KEEPING THEIR ROOFS OVER THEIR HEADS. MY DAD LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, I PROMISE YOU, IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT. HE BELIEVED IT. TODAY, THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT LOOK AT THEIR KIDS AND SAY, WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. WE HAVE OVER 50% OF WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE WHO THINK THEIR CHILDREN WILL NEVER ACHIEVE THE SAME STANDING THEY HAVE. WHAT A GOD AWFUL THING. IT JUST MAKES ME MAD. WE ARE GOING TO INVEST IN OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. IN ROADS AND BRIDGES, BROADBAND, SCHOOL SYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE. WE WILL GET TO THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. I MAKE NO APOLOGIES. IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF EVERYBODY. THE WEALTHY, THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE WORKING CLASS. WHEN EVERYONE DOES BETTER, EVERYTHING WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES HAVE THE SAME CHANCE TO ACCUMULATE WEALTH. YOU LIVE IN A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU HAVE THE SAME WEIGHT , HOUSES THE GUY LIVING ACROSS THE NEIGHBORHOOD. YOURS IS VALUED LESS. YOU PAY MORE FOR INSURANCE. HOW DO YOU GET A CHANCE TO ACCUMULATE WEALTH? THAT IS NOT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FULFILL THE DREAMS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO INVEST IN TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY. THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY RAKED IN THEIR FAVOR. WE WILL INVESTED IN FAMILIES INSTEAD. I REALLY MEAN IT. I HAVE DONE IT. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT WE CAN GET DONE IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. FIRST, WE HAVE TO BE DONALD TRUMP. WHEN THOSE FOLKS CAME OUT IN CHARLOTTESVILLE CARRYING THOSE TORCHES, I NEVER WOULD'VE LEAPT IT. , BELIEVED IT. SCREECHING HATE. CARRYING NAZI BANNERS. CHANTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT WAS CHANTED IN THE STREETS OF GERMANY. THAT IS THAT THEY JILL AND I KNEW, AND MY GRANDCHILDREN KNEW, WE HAD NO CHANCE BUT TO RUN. I THOUGHT WE HAD FINALLY TURNED A CORNER. I HAD BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED ALL OF MY LIFE. BUT I LEARNED HATE DOES NOT GO AWAY. IT JUST HIDES. THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE NOTHING BUT BREATHE OXYGEN INTO THAT HATE. BRING IT OUT FROM UNDER THE ROCKS. AT HIS RALLIES, HE SPREADS THE MESSAGE OF PREJUDICE AND DIVISION. IN THE WHITE HOUSE, HE WELCOME AND SEND GUN MANUFACTURERS WHY , WHILE I KIDS ARE BEING GUNNED DOWN IN THE STREETS AND IN SCHOOLS. HE HAS 35 STATES SUPPRESSING THE BOAT, PRIMARILY TO KEEP PRODUCT , BLACK FOLKS AND BROWN FOLKS FROM VOTING. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. IT HAS TO STOP. I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE FIGHTING FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, SOCIAL JUSTICE. THIS DAY, 30 YEARS AGO, NELSON MANDELA WALKED OUT OF PRISON. I HAD THE GREAT HONOR OF MEETING HIM. HE WALKED IN. THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING I HAVE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE. HE SAID THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO COME AND SEE ME. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN CHAOS. BUT WHAT DID HE DO? HE IS A SAMPLE I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT. PEOPLE ASKED ME IF I WILL HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST TRUMP FOR GOING AFTER MY SON. IT IS NOT ABOUT ME AND MY SON. THAT MAKES ME ANGRY. PRESIDENTS CANNOT JUST FIGHT. THEY HAVE TO DEAL. WE HAVE TO DO IT WITH THE SAME KIND OF COURAGE AND CONVICTION. BY THE WAY, I AM NOT NELSON MANDELA. I AM NOT MAKING THAT COMPARISON. ALL OF YOU MINISTERS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT IS THE KIND OF CONVICTION WE NEED TO MOVE THIS NATION FORWARD. LORD, GIVE ME THE ABILITY TO CLIMB. TOGETHER WE WILL BE DONALD TRUMP. JEFF AND AND ANN SUPPORT OUR CAMPAIGN. LET'S GET TO WORK.

WHEN I CAME BACK, THE FIRST THING I DID, I LANDED IN PHILADELPHIA. I WENT BACK TO HER APARTMENT IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. I KNOCKED ON HER DOOR. SHE SAID, COME ON IN. I SAID, I'M NOT COMING IN. I SAID, YOU'RE FINALLY GOT MY IRISH UP. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ONE MORE TIME. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TELL ME WHEN, JUST IF WE WILL MARRY ME. I SAID, WILL YOU MARRY ME? SHE WENT LIKE THIS. OK. MY SISTER ASKED , MY SISTER VALERIE , I ASKED HER, , HE ASKED HER, WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE BOYS. I HAD MY TWO BOYS. SHE SAID, I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE BOYS. I ENVY YOUR HUSBAND NOTWITHSTANDING. I KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO LOSE A SPOUSE. GOD LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. I DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS COMING, THAT I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A RELATIVE OF OURS FROM IRELAND. I DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS GOING TO BE HERE. MY MOTHER'S MOTHER'S NAME WAS BLEWITT. MY FATHER'S NAME WAS FINNEGAN. ONE WAS FROM COUNTY MAYO IN IRELAND. DURING THE TERRIBLE POTATO FAMINE WHEN THE BRITISH WERE DOING VERY BAD THINGS TO THE IRISH AT THE TIME, NOT A JOKE, MY GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER GOT ON A SHIP IN 1842 AND HEADED WITH SEVERAL OF HIS FAMILY MEMBERS, I BELIEVE ILLEGALLY, TO LOUISIANA. NEW ORLEANS. MADE HIS WAY NORTH. WHERE ARE YOU SITTING? ARE YOU OUT THERE SOMEWHERE? THERE SHE IS. BY THE WAY, WE CAUGHT UP , I HAVE BEEN TO IRELAND MANY TIMES. WE CAUGHT UP WHEN BARACK OBAMA , THE EQUIVALENT OF THE PRIME MINISTER KEPT SAYING, LET JOE COME TO IRELAND. WE WANT TO GIVE HIM 100,000 WELCOMES. I WENT TO IRELAND AND I FOUND OUT , I HAD NEVER MET MY FAMILY. SHE HEADS UP HOSPICE IRELAND. THEY JUST DEDICATED A $4 MILLION FACILITY TO MY DECEASED SON WHO DIED OF CANCER. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: THE REASON I BOTHERED TO TELL YOU THAT IS BECAUSE GARY IS TALKING OF FAMILIES. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT FAMILY. NOT A JOKE. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT FAMILY. EACH OF YOUR FAMILIES WHEN THEY DECIDED TO GET ON A BOAT OR A PLANE OR HOWEVER THEY GOT HERE AND HEAD OF TO THE UNITED STATES, THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY WERE NOT AT ALL CERTAIN THINGS WOULD BE ALL RIGHT. BUT THEY HAD THE COURAGE AND THE TENACITY AND THE RESILIENCE AND THE OPTIMISM TO THINK THEY COULD MAKE IT, THAT THEY COULD DO IT. I MET , I WAS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA NOT LONG AGO. ACTUALLY, I WAS MEETING WITH A GROUP OF LEADERS. I SAID TO THEM, THE REASON WHY AMERICA IS WHO WE ARE BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHERRY PICK THE BEST , AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY , WE ARE THE MOST UNIQUE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHERRY PICK THE BEST FROM EVERY CONTINENT AND CULTURE. THE PEOPLE WHO, ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESILIENT. PEOPLE WHO HAVE COURAGE. PEOPLE WHO ARE READY TO WORK AND WORK AND PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THAT IS WHO WE ARE, TRULY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. THE IDEA THIS PRESIDENT AND MANY OF HIS COHORTS TREAT THIS LIKE IT IS A PROBLEM , IMAGINE WHAT WE WOULD BE IF WE DID NOT HAVE IMMIGRATION. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT OF JAPAN AND I HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS WITH MR. ABE. IN JAPANESE CULTURE, AND A WOMAN AS WELL EDUCATED AND MARRIES AND HAS CHILDREN, SHE IS ENCOURAGED TO STOP ENGAGING IN THE WORKFORCE. WE DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WORKFORCE REPLACEMENT. THAT IS ONE OF OUR STRENGTHS BECAUSE PEOPLE KEEP COMING. AN AWFUL LOT OF NATIONS ARE MORE XENOPHOBIC. SO WHAT IS HAPPENING? I CAME BACK FROM JAPAN, I SAID, MARK MY WORDS. THEY ARE GOING TO CHANGE THEIR POLICY JUST LIKE CHINA IS GOING TO CHANGE THEIR POLICY ABOUT ONE CHILD. THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN CHINA RETIRED THEN ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WORK. THEY CANNOT SUSTAIN IT. THEY DID AWAY WITH THE ONE CHILD POLICY. JAPAN, MY GENERIC POINT IS, THE UNITED STATES IS THE MOST UNIQUE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. YOU'RE A PRODUCT OF AN IDEA. YOU CANNOT DEFINE AN AMERICAN FOR ME. YOU CANNOT DEFINE WHEN BASED ON ETHNICITY, RACE, NATIONAL ORIGIN. IT IS AN IDEA. THE IDEA WE DECIDED THAT WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN, WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. IT SOUNDS CORNY, BUT IT IS TRUE. NO NATION IN HISTORY HAS EVER BEEN ORGANIZED BASED ON AN IDEA. YOU CAN DEFINE PALMIST , YOU CAN DEFINE A MOST EVERY OTHER NATION BASED ON ETHNICITY OR TRIBE. THIS KIND OF WHITE HOUSE HAS NO IDEA OF IT. ZERO. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I WANT TO SAY A COUPLE THINGS QUICKLY. THE FACT IS THAT THE SUPPORT OF YOUR COMMUNITY HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. AS SOON AS THIS IS OVER, THEY ARE GOING TO MARCH ME TO THE DOOR. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE OF THE PEOPLE , I'M GOING TO SHAKE HANDS WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM 99% OF THE API COMMUNITY. WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM 99% OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM 99% OF THE HISPANIC OR LATINO COMMUNITY. THE IDEA WE ARE GOING TO DECIDED NOMINATION BEFORE WE HAVE HEARD FROM ALL OF THOSE FOLKS IS RIDICULOUS. THE FACT IS THAT EVERYONE IS GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO VOTE AND VOTE EARLY IN THE STATE. THE FACT IS, THAT IS WHY BARACK AND I , I CALL HIM BARACK BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO CONFUSE HIM WITH THAT OTHER GUY WHO IS THE PRESIDENT. THAT IS WHY WE TOOK THE COMMUNITY SO SERIOUSLY. WE APPOINTED MORE AA PI JUDGES TO THE FEDERAL BENCH THEN ANY TIME IN HISTORY. MORE AI , MORE AA PI WOMEN THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION COMBINED. WE EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. WE PROVIDED COMPENSATION FOR FILIPINO WAR VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II, WHICH WAS LONG OVERDUE. BUT WE GOT IT DONE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND WHO WE OWE DEBTS OF GRATITUDE TO. MOST PEOPLE ONLY THINK ABOUT LATINO IMMIGRANTS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRANTS. ? DACA OFFERED OPPORTUNITY TO THOUSANDS OF FILIPINO DREAMERS. MY PLAN IS GOING TO LEGALIZE DREAMERS AND INCLUDE A ROAD TO CITIZENSHIP. BY THE WAY, GARY, I HAVE PROPOSED WE NOT ONLY DEAL WITH THE 800 TO 200,000 , WE SHOULD INCREASE TO 3 MILLION PEOPLE THE PEOPLE WHO CAN COME FOR FAMILY UNIFICATION. I THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT IT. THIS IS A BIG, STRONG, VIBRANT COUNTRY. THE IDEA WE CANNOT REUNITE MORE FAMILIES IS BIZARRE. IT IS WHAT MAKES US STRONG. IT IS THE WEB THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER. THE UNIVERSITY OF LAS VEGAS , NEVADA LAS VEGAS USES THE GRANT MONEY WE SUPPLY TO STUDENTS FOR SUPPORTING 4000 AA PI STUDENTS. THE IDEA THERE IS SOME LIMITATION ON THE CAPACITY OF THE IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY IS BIZARRE. CRITICALLY THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WE CUT IN HALF THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN THE AA PI COMMUNITY. THAT IS WHY I AM FIGHTING SO HARD TO PROTECT OBAMACARE AND BUILD ON IT AND NOT TEAR IT DOWN AND START OVER. 20 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE GAINED COVERAGE UNDER OBAMACARE. 2 MILLION IN THE AA PI COMMUNITY. 100 MILLION PEOPLE. IN THIS UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A MILLION HAD PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WHERE THEY COULD NOT GET COVERAGE. A CHILD WITH ASTHMA OR SOME OTHER PROBLEM. I WAS STUNNED TO FIND OUT TWO WEEKS AGO DONALD TRUMP SAID THE REASON WE HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS COVERED IS BECAUSE OF HIM. HE IS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I AM TAKING TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME. I APOLOGIZE. THERE IS SO MUCH TO SAY, SO MUCH TO DO. SO MANY GOOD FRIENDS TO DO IT WITH. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE TO RESTORE DECENCY AND HONOR. THE REASON WHY AMERICA HAS BEEN ABLE TO LEAD THE WORLD IS NOT BECAUSE WE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY. IT IS THE IDEA, NOT THE POWER OF MILITARY, THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE THAT HAS CAUSED THE REST OF THE WORLD TO REPAIR TO US. YOU TALK TO PEOPLE FROM WHERE YOU HAVE EMIGRATED. WHAT ARE THEY ASKING YOU? WHAT IS HAPPENING IN AMERICA? WHAT IS GOING ON? WHAT HAS CHANGED? WE ARE REDUCING OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD IN A MATTER OF YEARS UNLIKE ANY TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE HAVE TO REESTABLISH THE DECENCY AND HONOR. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. EVEN HIS SUPPORTERS DO NOT WANT TO , DO NOT WANT THEIR KIDS TO GROW UP LIKE HIM. I AM BEING DEADLY EARNEST. WE THOUGHT THERE IS A BASIC AMERICAN CODE OF HONESTY, DECENCY, LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND, TREATING EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY. GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR. THAT IS WHO WE HAVE BEEN. LOOK AT HOW IT HAS CHANGED SO RAPIDLY. WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE TO SHOW WHO WE ARE. WHAT I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE WE DO IS WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER AFFECTION. , OVER AFFECTION. FICTION. WE CHOOSE TRUTHS OVER LIVE , WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER LIVES. IT IS TIME FOR US TO GET UP. WE HAVE NEVER SET A GOAL WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHEN WE HAVE DONE IT TOGETHER. WE ARE GOING TO BE TOGETHER WHEN I AM PRESIDENT. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY, AND BECOME THE ENVY OF THE WORLD AGAIN. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. [APPLAUSE] THANK ALL OF YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. WE ARE NOT DONE YET. NOW COMES THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. WE NEED ALL OF YOU TO HEAD OVER TO THE CHINATOWN MODEL TO CAST YOUR BALLOT. WE ALL NEED TO BE AN LINE BY 8:00 P.M. EVERYTHING WE HAVE WORKED FOR HAS LED UP TO THIS. I AM SO EXCITED TO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. YOU CAN CAST YOUR BALLOT AND HEAD-ON BACK. WE WILL HAVE A BUFFET FOR EVERYONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

{"SpeechID":"CSPANJB202202050","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-02-20","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden Remarks on Gun Violence","RawText":"MORE FROM CAMPAIGN 2020 NOW WITH DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN. HE SPEAKS ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE AT A COMMUNITY CENTER IN LAS VEGAS AND TALKS ABOUT HIS HISTORY REGARDING GUN LEGISLATION AND WHAT HE HOPES TO ACCOMPLISH AS PRESIDENT, SAYING THE NUMBER OF LIVES LOST AND IMPACTED BY GUN VIOLENCE IS TOO HIGH. THIS IS JUST OVER 20 MINUTES. MY NAME IS STEPHANIE, AND I'M A LAS VEGAS NATIVE. I'M A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER OF 16 YEARS. I'M AN EVERYDAY AND PRETTY AVERAGE AMERICAN. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I'M A MOTHER OF TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN. I HAVE TWINS, A BOY AND A GIRL. MY SON IS NOW 13, AND MY DAUGHTER WILL FOREVER BE 4. YOU SEE, MY DAUGHTER WAS EXACTLY 4 YEARS, 2 MONTHS AND 3 DAYS OLD ON MARCH 6, 2011. THIS IS THE LAST TIME I SAW HER LAUGH, SMILE, OR GIGGLE. SHE WAS A VIVACIOUS LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS GOING TO MAKE A MARK IN THIS WORLD. THAT DAY I REMEMBER SITTING WITH HER ON THE COUCH BRUSHING HER CURLY LIGHT BRUNETTE HAIR, BRAIDING IT BACK SO IT WOULDN'T BE IN HER FACE FOR THE DAY, BUT LATER THAT DAY, OUR LIVES WOULD BE FOREVER CHANGED. WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS SHOT BY A STRAY BULLET. THE BRAIDS, THE BRAIDS I HAD SO HAPPILY MADE IN MY DAUGHTER'S HAIR JUST THAT MORNING WOULD BE HANDED TO ME BY A NURSE PLACED IN A PLASTIC BAG SHAVED FROM HER HEAD. HER CURLS WOULD BE REPLACED BY WIRES. MY DAUGHTER WOULD LAY IN A HOSPITAL BED AFTER BRAIN SURGERY HOOKED UP TO LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES WHILE WE WAITED TO SEE IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY PULL THROUGH THIS, IF THERE WAS ANY SIGN. TWO DAYS AFTER SHE WAS SHOT ON MARCH 8, 2011, WE MADE THE DECISION TO TURN OFF LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES. THEY LET ME HOLD HER ONE LAST TIME BEFORE TAKING HER BACK FROM ME. NO PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO ENDURE THIS PAIN. IT WAS WHEN I LEARNED THAT MY DAUGHTER WOULD NOT BE COMING HOME AND I WOULD NEVER KNOW WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DEATH THAT I WOULD DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO HELP PREVENT THIS TRAGEDY FROM HAPPENING TO ANOTHER FAMILY, TO ANOTHER INNOCENT CHILD. WE'VE SEEN A MOVIE THEATER SHOOTING IN COLORADO, A DEADLY SHOOTING AT A CHURCH IN SOUTH CAROLINA, THE VIRGINIA BEACH SHOOTINGS IN A PLACE OF WORK, COUNTLESS SCHOOL SHOOTINGS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, AND THE LARGEST AND DEADLIEST MASS SHOOTING RIGHT HERE IN MY HOMETOWN, LAS VEGAS. BUT THERE IS A DAILY TOLL OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY, TOO. 100 AMERICANS A DAY ARE SHOT AND KILLED, AND HUNDREDS MORE ARE INJURED. THEY ARE NOT MAKING NATIONAL HEADLINES, JUST LIKE MY DAUGHTER. THIS IS NOT JUST A LOCAL PROBLEM. THIS HAS BECOME A NATIONAL EPIDEMIC. A CRISIS. AND IT REQUIRES A NATIONAL SOLUTION. SINCE LOSING MY DAUGHTER, PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME WHAT THEY CAN DO. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO? YOU CAN VOTE. VOTE FOR A CANDIDATE THAT HAS A GUN POLICY. VOTE NOT JUST FOR ME, BUT FOR MY DAUGHTER, AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO NO LONGER CAN. VOTE SO THAT YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THIS PAIN. THANK YOU. NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU CONGRESSMAN. THANK YOU, STEPHANIE, FOR YOUR COURAGE AND FOR REMINDING US WHAT'S AT STAKE. I AM NOT HERE AS A CONGRESSMAN. I'M HERE AS THE SON WHO LOST MY FATHER TO GUN VIOLENCE WHEN I WAS 19 YEARS OLD. RIGHT HERE IN LAS VEGAS. A BLOCK AWAY FROM WHERE I GREW UP AND WHERE I WOULD LATER WORK AS THE HEAD OF THE CULINARY ACADEMY. MY FATHER WAS SHOT AND KILLED WHILE I WAS A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA-RENO. AND ON THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL IN AN AMBULANCE, HE PASSED. AND SO THE NEXT TIME I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE MY FATHER WAS AT HIS FUNERAL. HE WOULD NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE ME FINISH SCHOOL, TO START MY OWN FAMILY, OR TO SERVE MY COMMUNITY NOW AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS. I DON'T WANT ANY OTHER FAMILY TO FEEL THE PAIN OF LOSING A LOVED ONE. TO SENSELESS GUN VIOLENCE. AND I AM DOING EVERYTHING I CAN AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS TO DO OUR JOB, TO PASS GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION THAT WILL KEEP OUR FAMILIES SAFE, BUT I'M ALSO SUPPORTING SOMEONE FOR PRESIDENT WHO I KNOW UNDERSTANDS THE TRUE SACRIFICE AND THE LOSS THAT SO MANY FAMILIES HAVE FELT. BECAUSE HE HAS EXPERIENCED THAT SAME LOSS HIMSELF. HE'S ALSO SOMEONE WHO LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO BROUGHT UP THAT TRAGIC SHOOTING ON 1 OCTOBER. THE BIGGEST MASS SHOOTING IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. HE'S ALSO THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS TAKEN ON THE N.R.A. AND WON. AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED HIM AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I'M PROUD THAT HE'S HERE IN NEVADA TALKING TO VOTERS ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST. WE KNOW JOE, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, JOE BIDEN KNOWS US. HE KNOWS OUR PAIN. HE KNOWS OUR HOPES. AND OUR AMBITIONS. AND IT GIVES ME A GREAT HONOR TO INTRODUCE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT. THIS BEAUTIFUL LAS VEGAS MORNING. THE SUN IS SHINING. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WORK, THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL. VOTERS IN NEVADA ARE GEARING UP TO VOTE IN THE CAUCUS. BUT BY THE END OF THE DAY, THE END OF THIS DAY, APPROXIMATELY 100 MORE PEOPLE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WILL BE DEAD BECAUSE OF BEING SHOT WITH A GUN. BECAUSE OF CRIME, BECAUSE OF AN ACCIDENT, BECAUSE OF A SELF-INFLICTED WOUND OR A STRAY BULLET OR INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE OR INDISCRIMINATE MASS SHOOTINGS BECAUSE OF GUNS. ANOTHER NORMAL DAY IN AMERICA. BUT FOR THE CONGRESSMAN, WHO WAS JUST 19 YEARS OLD, AS HE JUST POINTED OUT, LOST HIS FATHER TO A GUN, AND FOR ALL THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE WITH ME TODAY STANDING BEHIND ME AND NEXT TO ME, FOR ALL THE PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, NORMAL, NORMAL HAS BECOME LIVING A NIGHTMARE. ON OCTOBER 1, 2017, IT WAS A NORMAL DAY IN LAS VEGAS. UNTIL ONE MAN IN POSSESSION OF A SMALL ARSENAL, ASSAULT WEAPONS, MANY MODIFIED WITH BUMP STOCKS INCREASING THE SPEED WITH WHICH HE COULD FIRE THE WEAPONS, AND 100 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION WITH EACH OF THOSE ASSAULT WEAPONS WAS ABLE TO IN JUST 10 MINUTES TAKE OUT 58 INNOCENT LIVES AND HUNDREDS MORE WERE WOUNDED. THE LARGEST MASS SHOOTING IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND NORMAL? NORMAL, TO ME, AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME, IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. NO, MOMS LIKE STEPHANIE, THEY DO NOT ACCEPT A WORLD WHERE HER BRIGHT, BEAUTIFUL 4-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER GETS CUT DOWN BY A STRAY BULLET IN FRONT OF HER TWIN BROTHER AND NOTHING CHANGES. I WANT TO SAY TO ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY, IT TAKES ENORMOUS COURAGE TO BE HERE. TAKES ENORMOUS COURAGE. EVERY SINGLE TIME I KNOW, EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU SHOW UP AT SOMETHING LIKE THIS OR YOU SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE, YOU RELIVE AS IF THE MOMENT HAPPENED THIS MOMENT. BUT YOU'RE GIVING PEOPLE COURAGE AROUND THE COUNTRY. I DON'T ACCEPT THAT WE CAN'T STAND UP AND SAY, NO MORE. TO THE VOICES WHO OFFER THOSE EMPTY WORDS OF SYMPATHY AND OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO YOU, AND THEN OPPOSE , OPPOSE A CHANGE IN ANY WAY THAT WOULD CURE THIS GOD-AWFUL PROBLEM. I'VE BEATEN THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION NATIONALLY TWICE. PASSED MEANINGFUL GUN LEGISLATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN. BUT IT WON'T JUST BE BECAUSE I'LL DO IT. IT'S BECAUSE MOMS AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE ARE NOW MOBILIZED. YOUNG VICTIMS, SCHOOLCHILDREN ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE MOBILIZED, PRICKING THE CONSCIENCE OF EVERYBODY OUT THERE WHO SAYS MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU. YOU KNOW, I , I THINK THAT , I THINK THE COUNTRY'S READY. YOU KNOW, AND I'M INCREDIBLY PROUD OF HAVING WORKED SO HARD WHEN I WAS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN PASSING THE BRADY BILL WITH BACKGROUND CHECKS. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT KEPT A WEAPON OUT OF THE HANDS OF THREE MILLION PEOPLE. THREE MILLION PEOPLE. THREE MILLION. OUT OF THE HANDS OF DANGEROUS PEOPLE. NOW, WE NEED TO FOLLOW THE LEADERSHIP OF THE NEVADA LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. THEY'VE SHOWN, UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS HERE IN NEVADA. REQUIRING BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR EVERY SINGLE GUN SALE. JUST COMMON SENSE. IT'S SUPPORTED BY 90% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SHARE THAT VIEW. WE HAVE TO GET IT DONE NATIONALLY. JUST TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF BACKBONE TO STAND UP TO THE THUGS. WORKING WITH DIANNE FEINSTEIN I WAS ABLE TO GET ASSAULT WEAPONS WITH HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES AND HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES DECLARED TO BE ILLEGAL, BANNED. WE GOT THEM BANNED FOR 10 YEARS. IT HAD TO BE REAUTHORIZED, AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DID NOT SUPPORT THAT. WE LOST THE CONGRESS. WE PASSED IT IN SPITE OF THE N.R.A. BECAUSE NO ONE NEEDS AN AR-15. SOMETHING DESIGNED FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE, NONE, OTHER THAN TO KILL HUMAN BEINGS. THERE'S NO OTHER RATIONALE FOR ITS EXISTENCE. AND TO KILL THEM AS QUICKLY AND AS BRUTALLY AS POSSIBLE. EVERY DAY THAT WE DO NOTHING ABOUT THIS EPIDEMIC OF ASSAULTS AND ASSAULT WEAPONS, HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES ON OUR STREETS IS AN INSULT. AND THE INNUMERABLE LIVES ACROSS THIS NATION THAT HAVE BEEN FOREVER SHATTERED BY THIS VIOLENCE. AS PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU I WILL GET THESE WEAPONS OF WAR OFF THE STREET AGAIN. AND OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW, IT'S SO LONG PASTIME THAT WE CORRECT ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS SPECIAL INTERESTS , GIVEAWAYS THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS HAS EVER ENGAGED IN. THE CIVIL LIABILITY PROTECTIONS GRANTED TO GUN MANUFACTURERS AGAINST BEING SUED BY THE VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE. ONLY MAJOR INDUSTRY , AND BY THE WAY, WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE KILLED IN WAR. DO Y'ALL REALIZE COUNTING THE VIETNAM WAR AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THIS DAY, THREE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AS EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY WARRIOR KILLED IN VIETNAM TO THIS MOMENT. THREE TIMES. 150,000 PEOPLE MURDERED, JUST SINCE 2005. 150,000 PEOPLE MURDERED! SINCE 2005. WE DON'T GRANT THAT KIND OF IMMUNITY TO ANYBODY ELSE. IMAGINE IF I STOOD UP HERE AND SAID TODAY, I VOTED TO GIVE IMMUNITY TO THE TOBACCO COMPANIES. I VOTED TO GIVE IMMUNE AT THIS, IF I DID, TO SAY I'M GOING TO VOTE TO GIVE IMMUNITY TO DRUG MANUFACTURERS WHO POURED NINE BILLION OPIOIDS OUT ON THE MARKET. IMAGINE, IMAGINE IF I STOOD HERE AND SAID TO YOU Y'ALL THAT I THINK THAT , OR I VOTED FOR GIVING IMMUNITY TO OIL COMPANIES FOR THE POLLUTION AND DAMAGE THEY DO TO THE GROUND WATER SUPPLIES, TO THE AIR, ETC. FOLKS, IT'S JUST FLAT-OUT IMMORAL. IT'S JUST FLAT-OUT IMMORAL. YOU KNOW, TOO MANY REPUBLICANS AND SOME DEMOCRATS LIKE BERNIE SANDERS VOTED FIVE TIMES AGAINST THE BRADY BILL THAT I WAS PASSING. FIVE TIMES. AGAINST BACKGROUND CHECKS AND WAITING PERIODS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT OF THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE DENIED HAVING ACCESS TO A WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T QUALIFY, THEY WEREN'T RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO OWN ONE. YOU KNOW, ANY ONE OF YOU AND THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME SHOULD BE ABLE TO WALK INTO A COURT OF LAW AND DEMAND THAT GUN MANUFACTURERS WITH THEIR ENORMOUS PROFITS, ENORMOUS PROFITS, BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CARNAGE THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR INFLICTING ON OUR SOCIETY. I PROMISE YOU IF I'M YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT, THEY'RE GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BECAUSE I AM COMING AFTER THEM. 150,000 DEAD ON OUR STREETS. THAT'S NOT COUNTING SUICIDES. 150,000 DEAD ON OUR STREETS BECAUSE OF THE GLAMOURIZATION OF AR-15'S, ASSAULT WEAPONS. WHAT IS THE RATIONALE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO BUY A MAGAZINE THAT HAS 100 ROUNDS IN IT, 100 BULLETS IN IT? IN FACT, MY FIRST DAY OF OFFICE, I'M GOING TO SEND A BILL TO THE CONGRESS REPEALING THE LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR GUN MANUFACTURERS, CLOSING THE BACKGROUND CHECK LOOPHOLES AND WAITING PERIOD, AND THAT NOW LET TOO MANY PEOPLE SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS. AND I STAND WITH ALL THE PEOPLE HERE TODAY WHO CARE ABOUT SAVING THEIR CHILDREN, CARE ABOUT NOT HAVING ENTIRE GENERAL , ENTIRE GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE SCARRED BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID TO BE SHOT AT SCHOOL. WHAT DO WE DO WHEN A VETERAN COMES HOME AND HE OR SHE HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF THE VICTIM , HE OR SHE HAS BEEN INJURED OR SHOT IN A WAR? WE TRY TO GIVE THEM AS MUCH MENTAL HELP AS THEY CAN, AS MUCH SUPPORT AS THEY CAN DEALING WITH THE NIGHTMARE OF WHAT HAPPENED. WHAT IN GOD'S NAME DO YOU THINK IS HAPPENING TO OUR CHILDREN? THE IMPACT ON THEIR PSYCHE? ON THEIR VERY STABILITY? WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE WE DOING? LOOK, I WROTE AN ACT. WE PUT PROTECTIONS IN THAT ACT SAYING AN ABUSER THAT HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF ABUSE CAN OWN A WEAPON BECAUSE THAT'S THE WEAPON OF CHOICE, TO KILL THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER. AND EACH TIME THAT WAS AUTHORIZED, I FOUGHT LIKE HELL TO GET MORE PROTECTION FOR THE ABUSED, SAYING THOSE WHO HAVE AN ORDER AGAINST THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE ABUSED COULD NOT OWN A WEAPON. THERE'S A BILL SITTING ON MITCH MCCONNELL'S DESK RIGHT NOW AS I SPEAK, BEING HELD UP BY THE N.R.A. AND THE PRESIDENT WHO IS OWNED BY THE N.R.A., THAT SAYS IF A BOYFRIEND ABUSES YOU, BEATS YOU UP, HAS , WHATEVER IT IS, THEY ARE NOT , THEY'RE EXEMPT FROM BEING ABLE TO BE TOLD THEY CAN'T OWN A WEAPON. WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE WE DOING? WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH US? LOOK, YOU KNOW, WE CARE A LOT ABOUT THE YOUNG BOYS AND GIRLS GETTING HOME SAFELY AFTER SCHOOL TODAY IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. WE ALSO KNOW, JILL AND I KNOW, IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT THE PAIN OF LOSING SOMEONE. BY INDISCRIMINATE CHANCE. TERRIBLE CAR CRASH TOOK THE LIVES OF MY FIRST WIFE AND MY BABY DAUGHTER. TRAGEDY MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN THROUGH. BUT NO ONE THOUGHT WE COULDN'T DO THINGS TO MAKE CARS SAFER. NO ONE SAID, BY THE WAY, DON'T TELL THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY THAT THEY NOT ONLY HAVE TO HAVE SEATBELTS, BUT THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S AIRBAGS, THEY HAVE TO TAKE OTHER PRECAUTIONS. NOBODY SAID THAT. WE TALKED ABOUT DEALING WITH THE CARNAGE ON THE HIGHWAY. SO WE PASSED THE SEATBELT LAW, REQUIRED AIRBAGS, WE CONTINUE TO MAKE CARS SAFER, REQUIRE A LICENSE TO DRIVE. AND FOR CARS TO BE REGISTERED AND INSURED. JILL AND I KNOW THE LOSS. CANCER TOOK OUR SON'S LIFE. BUT NO ONE SAID TO JILL OR ME THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE PASSING LAWS THAT DEAL WITH THE CAUSES OF THE TOXINS THAT CAUSE CANCER. NO ONE SAID TO JILL OR ME THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE SPENDING THE TIME, EFFORT AND MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T DIE OF BRAIN CANCER. NO ONE HAS SAID THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US TO TRY TO SAVE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS' LIVES OR DYING OF CANCER. WHY IN GOD'S NAME CAN WE SAY THAT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT 150,000 PEOPLE? BEING SHOT DEAD? IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, MURDERED? BECAUSE OF GUN VIOLENCE? LOOK, WHY ARE GUNS DIFFERENT? BECAUSE OF COWARDICE. BECAUSE OF COWARDS. COWARDS WHO ARE AFRAID TO TAKE ON THESE SPECIAL INTERESTS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO DAMN POWERFUL. OUR POLITICIANS AND ELECTED LEADERS UP TO NOW HAVE JUST BEEN TOO AFRAID. THE N.R.A. AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS STAND UP TO THEM, BUT THEY'RE AFRAID TO STAND UP TO THE GUN MANUFACTURERS AND DO WHAT THEY KNOW, AS THEY SAY WHAT THEY KNOW IN THEIR HEART, THEY KNOW IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IT'S NOT VIOLATING ANYBODY'S SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. YOU HEARD ME SAY BEFORE, IF YOU'RE HUNTING GEESE, YOU CAN ONLY HAVE THREE SHELLS IN YOUR SHOTGUN. WE PROTECT GEESE BETTER THAN WE DO PEOPLE. NOT ME. I'VE LOOKED IN THE EYES OF TOO MANY PARENTS AND I MEAN LITERALLY SCORES OF THEM, WHO'VE LOST THEIR CHILDREN TO GUN VIOLENCE. AND LOOKED IN THE EYES OF BRAVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. AND I MADE EACH OF THEM A PROMISE AND MADE MYSELF A PROMISE. I PROMISED THEM, AND I PROMISE ALL OF YOU, I WILL MAKE THIS PROMISE TODAY, THOSE FAMILIES HURTING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, I WILL NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER GIVE UP THIS FIGHT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO , WON'T STOP UNTIL WE BEAT THE N.R.A. AND IT WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WE BAN KILLER ASSAULT WEAPONS, UNTIL WE HOLD GUN MANUFACTURERS LIABLE. THAT IS MY PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHETHER I'M YOUR PRESIDENT OR I AM A CITIZEN. FIGHTING FOR IT. I PROMISE YOU I WILL NOT REST UNTIL WE BEAT THESE GUYS BECAUSE IT IS IMMORAL WHAT'S HAPPENING. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. I'M GOING TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THESE FOLKS. THANK YOU. SOME NEWS FROM THE CAM PAPER TRAIL TODAY. THE HILL IS REPORTING SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS IS CLOSING THE GAP BETWEEN HIM AND FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WHEN IT COMES TO BLACK VOTERS.

THANK YOU SO MUCH. THEY HAVE BEEN AS EMOTIONAL ABOUT THIS LAST WEEK'S EXPERIENCE AS ANY TWO PEOPLE I KNOW AND I THINK THEM SO MUCH. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, I'VE STUDIED HISTORY, USED TO TEACH HISTORY, AND I'VE SAID OFTEN TO THE STUDENTS THAT I USED TO TEACH WHO WOULD QUESTION WHY DO WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME READING AND STUDYING AND DISCUSSING THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPENED WAY BACK YONDER? I'VE OFTEN SAID THAT THEM, WE STUDY HISTORY IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT AND TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE CAN HAPPEN AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] AND TONIGHT, AS I STAND HERE, I AM THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THAT HISTORY. AND I'M RECALLING SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY ATTRIBUTED TO A GREAT FRESHMAN WHO CAME TO STUDY OUR PENAL SYSTEM AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING MAGICAL ABOUT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NOW, IN MY RESEARCH, I HAVE NOT FOUND THAT HE ACTUALLY SAID THIS OR WROTE THIS, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR HAVING SAID IT. IF HE DIDN'T SAY IT OR DIDN'T WRITE IT, THEN , THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA LIES IN THE FACT THAT THE GOODNESS THAT EXISTS IN AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE SUPPOSEDLY SAID THAT IF AMERICANS EVER CEASE T5OO BE GOOD, AMERICA WILL CEASE TO BE GREAT. [APPLAUSE] THIS CAMPAIGN, THIS YEAR IS ABOUT THE GOODNESS OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE AS OUR CANDIDATE A REAL GOOD MAN. [APPLAUSE] AS I TALK TO PEOPLE AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND IMPORTANT PATTERNS TAKING PLACE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT MANY WERE PEOPLE , PEOPLE WERE SAYING, IT ALL BOILED DOWN TO ONE FACT.

THE DEMOCRATS NOMINATE ME, I BELIEVE WE CAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP. [CHEERS] MR. BIDEN: KEEP NANCY PELOSI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AS SPEAKER, AND TAKE BACK THE UNITED STATES S BIDEN: JOIN US. MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS ACROSS AMERICA, JOIN US. DEMOCRATS WANT TO NOMINATE SOMEONE WHO WILL BUILD ON OBAMACARE AND NOT SCRAP IT, TAKE ON THE NRA AND GUN MANUFACTURERS, NOT PROTECT THEM, STAND UP AND GIVE THE POOR A FIGHTING CHANCE AND THE MIDDLE CLASS TO GET RESTORED, NOT RAISE THEIR TAXES AND KEEP THE PROMISES WE JOIN US. IF THE DEMOCRATS WANT A NOMINEE WHO IS A DEMOCRAT , [CHEERS] MR. BIDEN: A PROUD DEMOCRAT, AN OBAMA-BIDEN DEMOCRAT, THEN JOIN US. WE HAVE THE OPTION OF WINNING BIG OR LOSING BIG. THAT'S THE CHOICE. WE NEED TO BUILD ON THE COALITION, THE LEGACY OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT IN OUR LIFETIMES, BARACK OBAMA. THE WAY WE DO THIS IS BY BRINGING AMERICA TOGETHER, RACE, GENDER, PARTY, JUST LIKE WE DID IN SOUTH CAROLINA. AND LIKE WE CAN DO ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON TUESDAY AND BEYOND. FOLKS, WHEN BIG OR LOSE. THAT'S THE TO GIVE ALL AMERICANS ACCESS TO REAL OPPORTUNITY, TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS, AN ENVIRONMENT WITH CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER AND EDUCATION AND FUND OUR SCHOOLS, A NATION THAT WILL STAND UP TO AND BEAT THE NRA. [CHEERS] MR. BIDEN: REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SPACE SYSTEM, RUDOLPH INSTITUTIONAL RACISM , ROOT OUT INSTITUTIONAL RACISM, AND , YOUR JOB IS MORE THAN YOUR PAYCHECK. IT I ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY, LOOKING YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAYING HONEY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. FOR ALL OF OUR FAMILIES, FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THAT IS WHAT MAKES US DEMOCRATS. TALK IS CHEAP. . US IS OUR DECEPTIVE, , FALSE PROMISES ARE DECEPTIVE AND TALK ABOUT REVOLUTION, WE WOULD NEED REAL CHANGES RIGHT NOW. SOMETHING I'VE DONE MY WHOLE CAREER. I WILL AS PRESIDENT. THIS IS NO ELECTION TO SPEND ALL OUR TIME IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THIS IS A BATTLE FO THE SOUL OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AS ALL OF YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO BE UNITING AMERICA, NOT SEWING MORE DIVISION AND ANGER. A MEANS NOT ONLY FIGHTING, BUT HEALING THE COUNTRY. WOULD HAVE TO BE DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. WE THEM. WE CAN'T HAVE A NEVER-ENDING WAR. ABOVE ALL, IT IS TIME FOR AMERICA TO GET BACK UP. THE COUNTRY IS SO READY. SO READY. ONCE AGAIN, FIGHT FOR THE PROPOSITIONS THAT WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. WE SAY IT ALL THE TIME. BUT WE HAVE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO IT. WE HAVE NEVER BEFORE UNTIL THIS PRESIDENT WALKED AWAY FROM IT. AND IT IS THE REASON WHY JIM AND I AND ALL OF US ARE IN THIS. I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED THE. , EQUAL. I SAW IT A FEW DAYS AGO AND A TOWNHALL. I SPOKE WITH REVEREND ANTHONY THOMPSON, WHOSE WIFE MYRA WAS STUDYING THE WORDS OF HER BIBLE WITH EIGHT OTHER PARISHIONERS AT MOTHER EMMANUEL FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AGO. IT WAS A WEEKLY ROUTINE, READING SCRIPTURE AND FINDING PURPOSE AND FAITH IN GOD AND EACH OTHER, AND IN AN INSTANT, HATE, VENGEANCE, WHITE SUPREMACY PIERCED THAT FAITH AND THEY WERE LOST FOREVER. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND THE MOST REMARKABLE THING IN MY CAREER THUS FAR? A REMARK ABOUT REVEREND THOMPSON AND THE FAMILIES OF THE EMMANUEL NINE, IS THROUGH ALL THAT PAIN, ALL THE GRIEF, THEY FORGIVE. HERE'S THE DEAL. IN THEIR FORGIVENESS, THEY BROUGHT MORE CHANGE TO SOUTH CAROLINA THAN ANY THAT HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PREVIOUS 100 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: THINK ABOUT IT. THE CONFEDERATE FLAG CAME DOWN. [CHEERS] MR. BIDEN: REAL CHANGE. THAT'S WHY THE SUNDAY AFTER, JILL AND I AND MY FAMILY, WE CAME BACK TO MOTHER EMMANUELLE ON SUMMER SHOULD , SUNDAY SERVICES AT THE FUNERAL OF THE VICTIMS. SIX WEEKS EARLIER, WE HAD LOST OUR SON BEAU AND WE NEEDED TO BE HEALED TOO. I REALLY MEAN THIS. WE NEEDED WHATEVER THEY WERE EXUDING, AND WITH EVERY PIECE SEASON THAT HAS PASSED, THEY GOT UP AND FOUND PURPOSE TO LIVE LIFE WORTHY OF THE ONES THEY LOST, WORTHY OF THE LESSONS , BLESSINGS TO LIVE IN THIS REMARKABLE COUNTRY. WE LEFT HERE HAVING ARRIVED IN OVERWHELMING PAIN, THINKING WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS. SO I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT IS NO SMALL REASON WHY I'M IN THIS RACE. PEOPLE LIKE ALL OF YOU HERE TONIGHT ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP'S DIVISIVENESS WILL SOON BE OVER. [APPLAUSE] MR. BIDEN: AND AS JIM QUOTED, HE WAS RIGHT. THIS MULTIETHNIC COUNTRY WE CALL OUR DEMOCRACY, AMERICA, IT CAN'T SURVI THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS HAVE SEEN THE ALTERNATIVE. THINK ABOUT IT. THEY'VE SEEN HOW UTTERLY MEAN, SELFISH, LACK OF ANY SENSE OF EMPATHY OR CONCERN FOR ANYBODY ELSE, A PRESIDENT WHO NOT ONLY HAS HORRIBLE POLICIES, BUT THE WAY HE MOCKS AND MAKES FUN OF OTHER PEOPLE. TO ALL OF YOU HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, AND ESPECIALLY JIM CLYBURN, MY FRIEND, WHO LIVES WITH ME AND THIS CAMPAIGN ON HIS , LIFTED ME AND THIS CAMPAIGN ON HIS SHOULDERS. [CHEERS] MR. BIDEN: AND I MEAN ALL OF YOU. MANY I DON'T HAVE TIME TODAY , ALL OF YOU.

WE NEED TO SEND JOE CUNNINGHAM BACK TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. [CHEERS] MR. BIDEN: ALL OF US, ALL THE BIDENS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR US. FOLKS, SO HERE'S THE DEAL. LET'S GET BACK UP. WE ARE BRAVE, WE ARE RESILIENT PEOPLE. WE CAN BELIEVE AGAIN. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS PRESIDENT, SO GET UP, TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY. IT IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

MAYBE SOONER THAN MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD. MAYBE SOONER THAN THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BUT IT'S HERE AND THE DECISION DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO MAKE ACROSS AMERICA IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL DETERMINE WHAT OUR PARTY STANDS FOR, WHAT WE BELIEVE IN, AND WHAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET DONE. IF DEMOCRATS WANT TO NOMINATE SOMEONE WHO CAN BEAT TRUMP, KEEP NANCY PELOSI AS SPEAKER, HOLD THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND TAKE BACK THE U.S. SENATE, THE STATE LEGISLATURE, LIKE WE DID IN VIRGINIA, IF THEY WANT TO DO THAT, IF THEY WANT TO DO THAT, NOW IS THE MOMENT.

AND, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF DEMOCRATS WANT A NOMINEE WHO WILL BUILD ON OBAMA CARE, NOT SCRAP IT. [CHEERS] IF THEY WANT TO TAKE ON THE NRA AND NOT PROTECT THEM, IF THEY WANT TO STAND UP FOR THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS, WELL, FOLKS, WE'VE ARRIVED AT THAT MOMENT. THAT'S THE CHANGE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO STAND UP AND MAKE SURE THE MIDDLE CLASS DOESN'T HAVE TO RAISE THEIR TAXES, AND YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO MAKES A PROMISE THAT CAN BE KEPT, THEN JOIN US. AND IF DEMOCRATS WANT, IF DEMOCRATS WANT TO BUILD A COALITION AND A LEGACY OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRAT IN OUR LIFETIME, BARACK OBAMA , CHEERS] YOU CAN DO THIS, WE CAN DO THIS BY BUILDING A COALITION, WE CAN DO THIS BY BRINGING TOGETHER AMERICANS OF EVERY RACE, EVERY ETHNICITY, EVERY GENDER, EVERY ECONOMIC STATION, REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS AS WELL AS INDEPENDENTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS RACE IS BIGGER THAN JUST THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE CHARACTER OF AMERICA IS ON THE BALLOT. LITERALLY. [APPLAUSE] YOU CAN EITHER WIN BIG OR LOSE BIG. I SAID WINNING BIG OR LOSING BIG, THAT'S THE CHOICE. MOST AMERICANS DON'T WANT THE PROMISE OF A REVOLUTION. WHAT THEY WANT IS RESULTS. RESULTS. THEY WANT TO GIVE ALL AMERICANS ACCESS TO REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE AVAILABLE FOR EVERY AMERICAN. AN ENVIRONMENT WITH CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER, AND AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT FUNDS OUR SCHOOLS, PAYS OUR TEACHERS, AND MAKES SURE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS FREE, A NATION THAT'S ABLE TO STAND UP SUCCESSFULLY TO THE NRA, REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND MOBILIZE THE WORLD AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. [APPLAUSE] AND AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. A JOB, AS MY DAD USED TO SAY, IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT'S ABOUT WHO YOU ARE. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE, AFTER HAVING LOST A JOB, IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, WE HAD TO MOVE TO DELAWARE. IT TOOK THREE YEARS TO BE ABLE TO BUY ANOTHER HOME, BUT HE WOULD SAY, IT MEANS WHO YOU ARE. BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. MY DAD LIKE MANY OF YOURS MADE THAT LONGEST WALK, UP A SHORT SLIGHT OF STAIRS TO A KID'S BEDROOM AND SAY, HONEY, DAD LOST HIS JOB, MOM LOST HER JOB, WE CAN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO MAKE THIS WALK. WE CAN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE. YOU'RE GOING TO GO HOME AND LIVE WITH GRANDPA AND MOM IS GOING TO AND YOUR BROTHERS ARE GOING TO GO HOME, TOO BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. YOUR SISTER. BUT I'M GOING TO MOVE DOWN TO DELAWARE. IT'S ONLY 157 MAILS AWAY. I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE GOING TO THE MOON WHEN HE SAID IT. NO, I REALLY DID, SO I CAME HOME EVERY WEEKEND. AND WHEN I GET IT PUT TOGETHER IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY, I PROMISE YOU. MY DAD BELIEVED IT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS AN EVEN CHANCE IF HE WORKED LIKE HELL HE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY BUT GO BACK TO YOUR OLD NEIGHBORHOODS, ASK THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THAT WALK TODAY, ASK THEM WHO THEY THINK THEY CAN LOOK THEIR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY AND MEAN IT. THE TRUTH IS, WE HAVE NOW NO LONGER THE WEALTHIEST MIDDLE CLASS IN THE WORLD, THE POOR ARE GETTING KILLED. WE'RE IN A POSITION WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE RECEIVE A BILL FOR $400 PER MONTH THEY DIDN'T EXPECT, GUESS WHAT, THEY WOULD HAVE TO BORROW THE MONEY OR SELL SOMETHING. FOLKS, THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT'S NOT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE , THAT'S NOT WHERE WE'VE BEEN OR HAVE TO BE. LOOK, I'M IN THIS FOR ALL OUR FAMILIES. FOR ALL OUR COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THAT'S WHAT MAKES US DEMOCRATS. TALK IS CHEAP. FALSE PROMISES ARE DECEPTIVE. THE TALK OF REVOLUTION ISN'T CHANGING ANYONE'S LIFE RIGHT NOW. THE FACT IS, YOU NEED REAL RESULTS AND WE NEED THEM NOW. THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE MY WHOLE CAREER AND I'LL DO IT AS PRESIDENT. IT ISN'T AN ELECTION TO SPENDS OUR TIME IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THAT'S GOING TO BE DETERMINED BY ALL OF YOU. BUT WE'RE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. THIS IS THE MOST PERILOUS MOMENT IN THE LIFETIME OF ANYONE HERE IN TERMS OF POLITICS. YOU'VE NEVER VOTED IN AN ELECTION, NO MATTER HOW OLD YOU ARE, THAT'S MORE CONSEQUENTIAL THAN WHERE WE ARE NOW. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER IN MY BEING, THAT WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, I ANNOUNCED MY CANDIDACY UP IN PHILADELPHIA. WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA. NOT SELLING MORE DIVISION. IT MEANS NOT ONLY FIGHTING BUT HEALING THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] YOU'VE GOT TO HEAL IT. WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BUT WE CAN'T BECOME LIKE THEM. WE CAN'T BECOME THEM. I GET CRITICIZED IN THIS CAUCUS IN THIS DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, FOR TALKING ABOUT, WE'RE NOT , WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ENDLESS WAR. FOLKS, SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK WITH ENDLESS WAR BETWEEN THE PARTIES. IF THAT HAPPENS, THAT CONTINUES, I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE CAN'T BRING IT TOGETHER BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T ALL THAT'S LEFT, ALL THAT'S LEFT IS THE ABUSE OF POWER BY A PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE. IT'S NOT AT ALL CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONSTITUTION. FOLKS, LOOK, WE MUST HEAL OUR DIVISIONS AND REPAIR THIS DEMOCRACY AND ABOVE ALL, IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO GET BACK UP, AND ONCE AGAIN, FIGHT FOR THE PROPOSITION, AS CORNY AS I SOUNDS, THE PROPOSITION, THE TRUTH IS SO SELF EVIDENT, WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR. [APPLAUSE] WE, THE PEOPLE, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION, LOOK, LOOK, WE'VE NEVER LIVED UP TO THOSE WORDS OF JEFFERSON, BUT WE HAVE NEVER, NEVER, NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THEM. LIKE WE HAVE UNDER THIS PRESIDENT. I BELIEVE THOSE WORDS WITH EVERY FIBER IN MY BEING. I SAW A FEW DAYS AGO IN A TOWN HALL ON CNN IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, YOU KNOW, A GENTLEMAN SPOKE UP OR REVEREND, HE STOOD UP AND HE ASKED ME A QUESTION IN THAT TOWN HALL, HIS NAME IS REVEREND ANTHONY THOMPSON, WHOSE WIFE MYRA, WAS STUDYING THE WORDS OF HER BIBLE WITH EIGHT OTHER PARISHIONERS, WITH MOTHER EMANUEL 4 1\/2 YEARS AGO. IT WAS THEIR WEEKLY BIBLE STUDY. AND, YOU KNOW, A WHITE SUPREMACIST WALKED IN, THEY WERE TRYING TO FIND PURPOSE IN FAITH AND IN GOD AND IN EACH OTHER. AND IN AN INSTANT, IN AN INSTANT, WHAT HAPPENED. HATE'S VENGEANCE PIERCED THEIR FAITH. THEY ARE LOST FOREVER. ONCE MOST INCREDIBLE ABOUT THAT CONGREGATION, WHAT'S MOST REMARKABLE, IS REVEREND THOMPSON AND THE FAMILIES OF EMMANUEL NINE IS THAT THROUGH THEIR PAIN AND GRIEF, THEY FOR GAVE. REMEMBER, THEY FORGAVE THE KILLER, AND IN THEIR FORGIVENESS, MORE CHANGE, MORE CHANGE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO SOUTH CAROLINA THAN IN THE PAST HUNDRED YEARS. THE CONFEDERATE FLAG CAME DOWN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] FOR REAL. BASICALLY SHAMED THE LEGISLATURE IN DOING THE RIGHT THING. AND REAL CHANGE BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE. THAT WAS SIX WEEKS AFTER MY SON BO BIDEN HAD JUST DIED. AFTER A LONG, LONG ILLNESS. AND MY WIFE AND MY SON AND DAUGHTER AND I, WE STAYED DOWN ANOTHER TWO DAYS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE SUNDAY SERVICE AT MOTHER EMMANUEL. AFTER THE FUNERALS HAD ALREADY TAKEN PLACE AND THE MEMORIAL SERVICE HAD ENDED. BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO HEAL. WE NEEDED TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE, WHERE WE, THE FAMILY, COULD FIND THE KIND OF PEACE. GOD KNOWS HOW THEY FOUND IT. FOLKS, WE WENT BACK TO THAT CHURCH AND WITH EVERY DAY THAT'S PASSED, EVERY SEASON THAT'S PASSED, THEY HAVE GOTTEN UP AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET UP, BECAUSE WE LEARNED, AND I'M NOT PROSELYTIZING, I'M NOT TRYING TO CONTINUE ANY PARTICULAR FAITH, BUT IT WAS FAITH THAT GOT US BACK UP. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THIS. [APPLAUSE] BUT EVERY DAY, EVERY SEASON THAT'S PASSED, YOU KNOW, WHAT I LEARNED, AND A LOT OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH AS MUCH OR WORSE THAN I HAVE BEEN THROUGH IN YOUR FAMILY LIFE, LOSING CHILDREN AND A WIFE AND THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT , BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU FIND OUT WHAT I FOUND, AND THAT'S WHY I WENT BACK TO THE CHURCH, I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS, BACK TO THEIR CHURCH, IS THAT I FOUND THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH REAL LOSS IS TO FIND PURPOSE. TO FIND PURPOSE. AND TO DO THINGS THAT ARE WORTHY OF THE BLESSINGS TO LIVE IN THIS REMARKABLE COUNTRY AND THE THINGS THAT YOU HOPE AND PRAY, THAT WHAT YOU LOST WOULD BE PROUD OF YOU FOR DOING. HOW MANY IN THIS ROOM, IN THIS GYMNASIUM, HAVE LOST A CHILD, MOTHER, FATHER, BROTHER, SISTER, LOOK AROUND, ANYWHERE FROM HALF TO 2\/3 OF THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT WORSE THAN I HAVE BEEN THROUGH WITHOUT ANY KIND OF HELP FROM THE FAMILY THAT I HAD. MY POINT IS. YOU'RE THE REASON I'M IN THIS RACE. PEOPLE LIKE YOU HERE TONIGHT AND ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE THE DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP'S DIVISIVENESS HAS TO COME TO AN END. [APPLAUSE] WITH NO APATHY, NO CONCERN, NO ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. THEY HAVE TO END. BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THE ALTERNATIVE. THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THIS. THEY NOW KNOW, THEY NOW KNOW, THERE ARE TWO WAYS PEOPLE GET INSPIRED. BY INSPIRATIONAL LEADERS FROM LINCOLN ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO OBAMA, OR BY REALLY BAD PEOPLE. BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY SENSE OF DECENCY AND HONOR AND COMPASSION. GUESS WHAT? THE DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP HAVE, IN FACT, MADE PEOPLE REALIZE WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS. WE HAVE TO BUILD A MORE PERFECT UNION BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THE ALTERNATIVE. SO MY MESSAGE TO YOU IS SIMPLE. FOLKS, LET'S GET BACK UP. WE'RE DECENT, BRAVE, RESILIENT PEOPLE. WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS MOMENT AND WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS PRESIDENT. SO GET UP. [APPLAUSE] LET'S TAKE THE COUNTRY BACK. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE HAVE NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER FAILED WHEN WE'VE SET OUR MIND TO IT AND DONE IT TOGETHER. I MEAN THIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. IT'S TIME TO GET UP, TAKE BACK THE COUNTRY, AND LEAD THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

[APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND THANKS TO MY TEACHERS AND COACHES I WAS ABLE TO PLAY IN THE NFL YOU TO BECOME A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER THAT'S WHO WE ARE IN NORTH TEXAS. IF YOU DO THE RIGHT THING AND TRY HARD YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET A HAND IN. WE DID SOMETHING SPECIAL TOGETHER. WE DID SOMETHING SPECIAL SO MANY FOLKS, SO MANY IN THIS ROOM CAME TOGETHER TO HELP US.

ALL OF US ARE HERE SUPPORTING JOE BIDEN BECAUSE WE KNOW HE'S A GOOD MAN. HE UNDERSTANDS WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. THERE'S NO ONE BETTER THAN JOE BIDEN TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AFTER THE HORRIBLE YEARS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH. BUT THE FIRST THING WE'VE GOT TO DO IS MAKE SURE JOE BIDEN WINS TEXAS TOMORROW. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] I UNDERSTAND IT IS TOUGH TO MAKE THEIR MIND UP BUT NOW WE KNOW WHO WE ARE COMING TOGETHER BEHIND. JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] WHAT THEY TURNED OVER TO MY GOOD FRIEND WHO I ALWAYS ASK FOR ADVICE AND WE KNOW IS REPRESENTED IN THE CONGRESS AND STATEHOUSE.

[APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) PLEASE WELCOME ABIGAIL, JOHN, DOCTOR JILL BIDEN, AMY KLOBUCHAR AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) [CHEERING] THANK YOU! UNBELIEVABLE. HOW GREAT IS IT TO BE HERE IN DALLAS, TEXAS? [CHEERING] AND HOW GREAT IT IS TO BE HERE WITH MY FAMILY, JOHN AND ABIGAIL AND WITH VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. AND HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO BE STANDING NEXT TO HIM ON THE STAGE WHEN IT ISN'T THE DEBATE STAGE. [CHEERING] SO, I ACTUALLY ASKED YOU ALL KNOW ANNOUNCED MY CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A MINNESOTA BLIZZARD JUST SO I COULD IMPRESS EVERYONE IN TEXAS. [CHEERING] AND IN PARTICULAR, EVERYONE IN DALLAS. SO, WE DIDN'T LET THE SNOW STOP US. WE DIDN'T LET THE COLD STOP US. WE DID CONTINUE THROUGH THAT SPEECH BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN THE HEARTLAND. WE MADE THE CAMPAIGN GO A LONG WAY, AND OUR HOMEGROWN CAMPAIGN WITH A TREMENDOUS STAFF THAT STUCK TOGETHER FROM THE BEGINNING AND VOLUNTEERS BEAT THE ODDS AND THAT GOT ME UP HERE RIGHT NOW ON THIS STAGE IN DALLAS. [APPLAUSE] AND THE MOST AMAZING THING WAS GETTING TO KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND I KNOW THE VICE PRESIDENT DOES THIS AS WELL. THE VIETNAM VET AS HE TALKED ABOUT HAVING HIS SON FROM MENTAL ILLNESS. THE RANCHER THAT VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP THAT AFTER HE SAW HIM GIVE A SPEECH IN FRONT OF THAT SACRED WALL WITH A CIA STAR OF THOSE THAT LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE LINE OF DUTY DECIDED HE WASN'T GOING TO DO IT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] THE IMMIGRANT MOM WHO TOLD ME SHE WORKS TWO JOBS OLD FOR HER KIDS, AND THROUGH IT ALL I SAID TO THEM, AND I BELIEVE THIS NOW STANDING WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT, IF YOU FEEL TIRED OF THE NOISE AND NONSENSE IN OUR POLITICS, AND IF YOU ARE TIRED OF THE EXTREMES, YOU HAVE A HOME WITH ME AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A HOME WITH JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] SO MANY PEOPLE JOINED US, SUPPORTED US AS WE CARRIED FORWARD WITH THIS SIMPLE BUT FUNDAMENTAL MESSAGE IN THAT IT IS TIME FOR AMERICANS TO JOIN HANDS AND STICK OF POINTING FINGERS , INSTEAD OF POINTING FINGERS. IT IS TIME TO TURN BACK THE DIVISION AND HATE AND EXCLUSION AND BITTERNESS COMING INTO THIS TIME TO WORK TOGETHER TO LIFT UP THOSE WHO ARE LEFT OUT AND TO BRING PEOPLE WITH US INSTEAD OF SHOVING THEM AWAY. [APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE IT IS THE REASON I END AM UP HERE THAT WE ARE NEVER GOING TO OUT DIVIDE THE DECIDER IN CHIEF. WE MUST AS AMERICANS DREAM BIGGER THAN THAT. WE HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN THAT. BECAUSE IF WE SPEND THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS DIVIDING OUR PARTY AND GOING AT EACH OTHER, WE WILL SPEND THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WATCHING DONALD TRUMP TEAR APART THIS COUNTRY. WE NEED TEXANS, WE NEED TO UNITE OUR PARTY AND OUR COUNTRY. AND TO DO IT, NOT JUST WITH OUR WORDS BUT WITH OUR ACTION IT IS UP TO US, ALL OF US TO PUT THE COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER, TO HEAL THE COUNTRY AND THEN TO BUILD SOMETHING EVEN GREATER. I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER AND THAT IS WHY TODAY I AM ENDING MY CAMPAIGN AND ENDORSING JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] I HAVE A FEW OTHER THINGS TO SAY. [LAUGHTER] JOE BIDEN HAS DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE. NOT FOR THE RICH AND THE POWERFUL, BUT FOR THE MOMS, THE FARMER, THE DREAMER, FOR THE BUILDER, FOR THE VETERAN. HE CAN BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER AND FILLED THAT COALITION OF OUR FIGHTERS OF DEMOCRATIC FAITH AND AS WELL AS INDEPENDENTS AND MODERATE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE WE DO NOT IN OUR PARTY WANT TO GET BY A VICTORY, WE WANT TO WIN BIG. [APPLAUSE] AS YOU KNOW FROM ALL THE WORK HE HAS DONE, HE WILL NOT JUST GOVERN WITH HIS HAT. HE HAS A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS, BUT HE WILL ALSO GOVERN WITH HIS HEART AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IN THIS GREAT STATE OF TEXAS THE HEART OF THIS COUNTRY IS BIGGER THAN THE HEART OF THE GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] THIS TIME, AND AMERICA, AMERICA, FOR A PRESIDENT THAT UNDERSTAND THAT SERVICE IS NOT ABOUT SELF-INTEREST. IT IS ABOUT SACRIFICE. [CHEERING] IT IS TIME FOR A PRESIDENT THAT REPRESENTS ALL OF AMERICA, INCLUDING PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS COUNTRY, AT A TIME WHEN WE SEE PEOPLE IN THE EXTREMES THAT ARE TRYING TO DROWN OUT PEOPLE. AND MOST OF ALL, IT IS TIME , AND THIS IS WHAT I FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT , IS TIME FOR A PRESIDENT THAT WILL BRING DECENCY AND DIGNITY BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] [CHANTING] AT ONE OF THE DEBATES, THE MANY DEBATES, I TOLD A STORY , [LAUGHTER] I TOLD THE STORY OF FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT AND WHEN HE DIED HE PUT HIS BODY ON A TRAIN THAT WENT FROM GEORGIA TO WASHINGTON, D.C.. THE STORY IS PEOPLE SPONTANEOUSLY STOOD ALONG THE STREAM TRACKS TO SHOW THEIR RESPECT. AND A REPORTER CAME UP ON A REGULAR GUY THAT JUST HAD HIS HAT IN HIS HANDS AND HE WAS SOBBING. THE REPORTER SAID TO HIM SIR, DO YOU MIND ME ASKING DID YOU KNOW PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT? AND THE GUY SAYS NO, I DIDN'T KNOW THE PRESIDENT, BUT HE KNEW ME. HE KNEW ME. [CHEERING] AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS MISSING RIGHT NOW IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT HAS NO EMPATHY, BUT CANNOT PUT HIMSELF IN THE SHOES OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. WELL, GUESS WHO CAN DO THAT, AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING \"WE LOVE JOE!] SO, IF YOU OUT THERE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN STRETCH YOUR PAYCHECK TO PAY FOR YOUR RENT OR YOUR MORTGAGE OR SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY IS, YOU KNOW JOE KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. IF YOU ARE SOMEONE TRYING TO DECIDE HOW TO BE PAID FOR PAY FOR THE LONG-TERM CARE OF YOUR PARENTS AND CHILD CARE OR COLLEGE FOR YOUR KIDS, SHOW KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. AND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW AM I GOING TO FILL THAT PRESCRIPTION FOR INSULIN OR SOME OTHER PRESCRIPTION DRUG OR FILL MY REFRIGERATOR, JOE KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. SO, I CANNOT THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO END MY CAMPAIGN THAN BY JOINING HIS. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] BECAUSE AMERICA, YOU GAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF AN IRON ORE MINER, THE DAUGHTER OF A TEACHER AND A NEWSPAPER MAN. YOU GAVE ME, MINNESOTA, THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE FIRST WOMAN ELECTED TO THE U.S. SENATE IN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. IN AMERICA, YOU GAVE ME THIS INCREDIBLE YEAR TO BE A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE FAITH IN WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE TOGETHER. IT IS BECAUSE OF YOUR UNDYING BELIEF THAT FOR ALL OF US, THE BEST IS YET TO COME. SO, BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT, I WANT TO REMIND YOU OF SOMETHING REALLY PRACTICAL. TOMORROW IS SUPER TUESDAY. THERE ARE 14 SUPER TUESDAY STATES INCLUDING MY HOME STATE OF MINNESOTA. [CHEERING] SO, WHAT I WANT ALL OF YOU TO DO IS VOTE FOR JOE. VOTE FOR DECENCY, VOTE FOR DIGNITY, VOTE FOR THE HEART OF OUR COUNTRY THAT IS WHAT HE WILL BRING TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND WITH THAT, I GIVE YOU THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. HELLO, DALLAS. AS MY MOM WOULD SAY, I APOLOGIZE FOR MY BACK. IF YOU HAVE MY BACK I PROMISE I WILL HAVE YOURS. YOU KNOW, I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH THE SENATOR'S ENDORSEMENT MEANS TO ME. IT'S GREAT TO SEE HER FAMILY, HER HUSBAND JOHN INTO THEIR BRILLIANT DAUGHTER AND FROM THE MOMENT ANY KLOBUCHAR ANNOUNCED IN A SNOWSTORM IT WASN'T HARD TO SEE SHE HAD THE DETERMINATION TO DO ANYTHING SHE SETS HER MIND TO TO. AMY KNOWS HOW TO GET THINGS DONE. THAT'S WHY AMY HAS NEVER LOST, SHE'S NOT LOSING NOW. YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR A LOT FROM ANY KLOBUCHAR FOR A LONG TIME. SHE'S ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE SENATORS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. HER CAMPAIGN WAS ALL ABOUT WHAT WE COULD GET A GUN TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER EVERY DAY IN SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD WAYS. FOLKS, THE STORY AMY TELLS ABOUT THAT PERSON FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT AS THE TRAIN WENT BY. SHE BELIEVES IN THAT NOTION SHE DIDN'T KNOW THE PRESIDENT THAT HE KNEW ME. IT'S EVERYTHING AMY IS ABOUT. NOBODY HAS EVER DEALT WITH HER DOESN'T THINK THAT SHE KNOWS THEM AND ISN'T THAT EVERYTHING MISSING TODAY AMY'S BOOK IS SOMETHING THAT I SENT TO THE CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT AS WELL AND TO COMPLETE THE TOTAL LACK OF EMPATHY AND DECENCY IN THIS CURRENT PRESIDENT, HE CANNOT STAY THERE. WE ALL KNOW IT. THERE IS NO SENSE OF DECENCY OR HONOR THE WAY HE RIDICULES PEOPLE, THE WAY THAT HE DEMEANS PEOPLE. THE FACT THAT HE'S SO SELF ABSORBED HE DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS COUNTRY. I KNEW, I BELIEVE HE WASN'T GOING TO BE A VERY GOOD PRESIDENT, BUT I HAVE TO MENTION WITH DONALD TRUMP, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. IT'S HAVING A CORROSIVE IMPACT ON OUR CHILDREN. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN REPORTS OF CHILDREN IN SCHOOL MIMICKING THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PRESIDENT A LARGE PIECE IN THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" TALKED ABOUT THE WAY TEACHERS ARE ARE FINDING KIDS ARE BULLYING OTHER KIDS SINGLING OUT IMMIGRANTS RIDICULE AND HARASSMENT. WHAT IN GODS NAME DID WE EXPECT AND WHAT DID WE THINK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THIS BEHAVIOR BECAME SO CLEAR. WHEN THEY TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS HAVING A PROFOUND IMPACT ON OUR SOCIETY. I SAID MANY TIMES IN THE CAMPAIGN THIS NATION WILL BE ABLE TO OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP, BUT IF THIS MAN IS REELECTED, HE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE YARD AS A NATION FOR BETTER THAN A GENERATION TO COME AND WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] SO, AMY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT, THANK YOU FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND YOUR SUPPORT. ALSO THANK YOU FOR THE VOICE YOU ARE GOING TO SUPPLY IN THE RACE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENDORSEMENT I AM TRULY HONORED TO HAVE IT. I WASN'T JOKING, AMY WONG ALL THE DEBATES AND I'M GLAD I WASN'T ON STAGE DEBATING YOU AGAIN. THE PRESS AND THE PUNDITS DECLARED THIS CAMPAIGN DAVID BUT SOUTH CAROLINA HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT IT. [CHEERING] TOMORROW TEXAS AND MINNESOTA AND THE REST OF THE SUPER TUESDAY STATES ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT IT. AND WHEN YOU DO WE WILL BE ON OUR WAY TO DEBATING DONALD TRUMP FOR A SECOND TERM. MY MESSAGE TO EVERYONE, EVERY PERSON THAT HAS BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED OUT, LEFT BEHIND, THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. JOIN JOEBIDEN.COM. WE NEED YOU AND WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS. LOOK, TOMORROW ACROSS THE NEXT FEW WEEKS IT WILL DETERMINE WHAT THE PARTY STANDS FOR. WHAT WE BELIEVE AND WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO GET IT DONE. IF THEY WANT A NOMINEE TO BEAT DONALDBEATDONALD TRUMP ANDBEDONALD TRUMP, KEEP NANCY PELOSI SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WE KEEP SURE WE TAKE BACK THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THEY WILL BUILD OBAMACARE, NOT TOSCRAP IT, TAKE ON THE FRA, STAND UP FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS, NOT RAISE THEIR TAXES AND BIG PROMISES THAT CAN'T BE KEPT. THEN JOIN US. THE DEMOCRATS WANT A NOMINEE THAT IS A DEMOCRAT. AND OBAMA BIDEN DEMOCRAT. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] WEEKEND WIN BIG OR LOSE BIG. THAT IS A CHOICE. WE NEED TO BUILD A COALITION AND A LEGACY OF THE SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENTS OF A LIFETIME. BARACK OBAMA. AND WE WILL DO THIS BY BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. THAT'S WHAT UNITED AMY AND ME ALL ALONG. THE IDEA WE HAVE TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. REMEMBER HOW FOLKS MADE FUN SAYING IT CAN'T BE DONE. WE REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT REPUBLICANS ARE OUR ENEMY, THEY ARE THE OPPOSITION. WHAT, FOLKS, THIS TIME WE HAVE TO BRING A AROUND EVERYBODY, EVERY SITUATION DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, OF EVERY STRIPE. THAT'S WHY I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THE ENDORSEMENT FOR THE CAMPAIGN. SHE SHARES IN THAT VIEW. WE NOW HAVE OVER 1,500 ENDORSEMENTS INCLUDING 36 CONGRESSMEN MAYERS COUNTY ELECTED OFFICIALS JOINING THE CAMPAIGN THE LAST TWO DAYS. THEY DON'T WANT THE PROMISE OF A REVOLUTION. THEY WANT RESULTS, THEY WON'T HONOR AND CHARACTER AND THEY WANT TO GIVE ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY THAT PAYS TEACHERS A DECENT WAGE AND THINKS , A NATION WHERE WE STAND UP AND BEAT THE NRA REFORM SYSTEM. MOBILIZE THE WORLD AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE, THE WHOLE WORLD. A NATION WHERE WE LIVE OUR VALUES AND PLACE IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS BODYSLAM THE DOOR IN THE FACE OF THOSE. FOLKS, FOLKS, 24 OUT OF EVERY 100 STUDENTS IN SCHOOL IS LATINO. .. REWARDS WORK. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, JOEY A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK, IT IS ABOUT DECENCY, RESPECT, TO LOOK YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR AND KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON , I SWEAR TO GOD THIS IS WHAT HE SAID, LOOK YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE AND SAY EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY. AMERICA IS JUST ASKING FOR AN EVEN CHANCE IN THEIR BEING DENIED THAT. THIS IS ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND IT IS ABOUT ALL OF OUR FAMILIES, ALL OF HER COMMUNITIES. AMY AND I LOOK AT EVERYTHING , THERE GOES TRUMP'S, ANYWAY. HOW IT AFFECTS YOU, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR COMMUNITY, ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. FOLKS, IT IS SIMPLE, THAT'S WHY I'M A DEMOCRAT. THAT'S WHY I GOT INVOLVED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THIS ELECTION IS NOT A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. AND IN THE MOST PERILOUS MOMENT WE FACE IN ANYONE'S LIFETIME HERE, WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA NOT MAKING MORE DIVISION AND ANGER. IT MEANS NOT ONLY FIGHTING AS PRESIDENT BUT A PRESIDENT WHO HEALS THE COUNTRY. A COUNTRY HAS TO BE HEALED, WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BUT WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE THEM. [CHEERING] WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE THEM. WE HAVE TO HEAL THE DIVISION, REPAIRED DEMOCRACY. I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT, NOT ONLY DEMOCRATS BUT INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICAN VOTERS KNOW WE HAVE TO HEAL THIS COUNTRY. ONCE AGAIN FIGHT FOR THE PROPOSITION, AS CORNY AS IT SOUNDS. WE HOLD THE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT. THE ALLMAN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. THAT IS A UNIQUE OF AMERICA, WERE BASED ON AN IDEA, WE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO IT BUT WE'VE NEVER BEFORE WALKED AWAY LIKE THIS PRESIDENT HAS. I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER IN ME, WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH EVERY GENERATION HAS OPENED CONCLUSION CONCLUSION, MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A SHOT. , I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR CAREERS TO FIGHTING FOR MORE PERFECT UNION, COLIN, HE FLIPPED HIS DISTRICT TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE IN 2016. [CHEERING] HE DID WHAT I ONLY DREAMED OF DOING. PLAYING IN THE NFL. WHAT A HELL OF AN ATHLETE AND A GREAT CONGRESSMAN. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE HE HOLDS THAT SEAT IN NOVEMBER. IN MARK BEEBE, GOD LOVE HIM, HE'S DONE INCREDIBLE WORK. HELP LEAD THE FIGHT AGAINST THE EROSION OF VOTING IN HIS NATION. HALF THE NATION , HALF THE STATES IN THE NATION HAVE PUT UP BARRIERS, IT'S A NEW JIM CROW ALL OVER AGAIN. AND JOHNSON AS ALLEGING OF WHOM I MONITOR SHARE THE STAGE. SHE KNOWS HOW TO THINK AND TO GET THINGS DONE FOR THE PEOPLE OF DALLAS AND SHE LEAVES NO ONE BEHIND. TODAY IS DONALD TRUMP'S DIVISIVENESS WILL SOON BE OVER. I GUARANTEE YOU, WE CAN BUILD A MORE PERFECT UNION. BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE NOW SEEN THE ALTERNATIVE. FOLKS THERE'S TWO WAYS PEOPLE GET INSPIRE, THEY GET INSPIRED BY GREAT LEADERS LIKE LINCOLN AND ROOSEVELT AND KENNEDY AND OBAMA. THANK YOU BUT THEY ALSO GET INSPIRED BY VERY BAD LEADERS. I REALLY MEAN IT. THIS PRESIDENT HAS RIPPED THE BAND-AID OFF. EXPOSED HOW VENAL HE HAS BECOME AND HOW HE HAS LITERALLY STRANGLED THE LIFE OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. SO FOLKS, WE HAVE A SHOT. THIS IS BIGGER THAN WHETHER A DEMOCRAT WINS. THIS IS ABOUT RESTORING THE CHARACTER OF AMERICA. NOT A JOKE. BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN DAMAGED ALL OVER THE WORLD, WE'VE BEEN DAMAGED BADLY. HIS RACE OF THUGS AND DICTATORS, THE WAY HE TREATS HER MILITARY AND TALKS ABOUT THEM. THE WAY HE DEMEANED PEOPLE. LADIES AND DELTA MEN AT HOME, HE'S NEVER DONE ANYTHING OTHER THAN SEEK DIVISION. IT IS TIME TO GET BACK OUT. [CHEERING] WE ARE DECENT, BRAVE, RESILIENT PEOPLE AND WE CAN LEAD AGAIN, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS MOMENT AND BETTER THAN THIS PRESIDENT SO GET UP GRADE THAT'S TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND PROTECTIVE TROOPS. [CHEERING] FOLKS, THANK YOU. I HAVE ONE MORE MINUTE, ONE MORE PERSON I WANT TO THINK.

OUT OF THE BELLY OF OPPRESSION CAME HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES, I AM A SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS MAJOR HERE AT THE TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY. I WELCOME YOU ALL TO MY HISTORICAL AND BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS OF TEXAS SOUTHERN. WHEN I WAS CHOOSING WHICH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO SUPPORT, ONE THING WAS VERY IMPORTANT ME. THEIR VOCAL SUPPORT OF HBCU'S LIKE MY OWN. HBCU'S ARE A CRUCIAL PART OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN CULTURE ACROSS THE NATION. HBCU'S HAVE AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT, CREATE SKILLED WORKERS, SERVE AS ECONOMIC HUBS FOR THE AREAS THAT SURROUND OUR CAMPUSES AENED BEYOND. SOME OF THE NATION'S BRIGHTEST AND MOST INFLUENTIAL MINDS CAME OUT OF HBCU'S. JOE BIDEN HAS MADE IT CLEAR NOT JUST THROUGH HIS CAMPAIGNS BUT THROUGH DECADES OF PUBLIC SERVICE THAT HE PUTS HBCU'S AT THE TOP OF HIS PRIORITY LIST. I'VE MET HIM PERSONALLY. I KNOW WITH HIM A PROMISE ISN'T JUST WORDS. IT HAS A MEANING. WHEN HE SAID HE WANTS TO FIGHT TO GET ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR HBCU'S LIKE THIS ONE, HE MEANS IT. WHEN HE LAUNCHED THE PROGRAM HBCU STUDENTS FOR BIDEN THAT I'M PART OF, IT'S BECAUSE HE DEEPLY CARES ABOUT US. WE SAW IN SOUTH CAROLINA THE POWER THAT VOTERS OF COLOR HAVE. WE HAVE THE POWER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] . WE HAVE THE POWER TO SWING THIS ENTIRE RACE TOWARD A CANDIDATE THAT CAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP IN THE FALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE THAT POWER IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND WE MOST DEFINITELY HAVE THAT POWER HERE IN TEXAS. YOU CAN'T SAY HOUSTON WITHOUT INCLUDING C.S.U., THE HEART AND SOUL OF HOUSTON. , T.S.U., THE HEART AND SOUL OF HOUSTON. WE ARE A FEARLESS GENERATION. HERE IN HOUSTON, HERE IN TEXAS WE WORK HARD AND WE GO BIG. BIG DREAMS, BIG PLAN, BIG MOVES, BIG RESULTS. SO FRIENDS, FAMILY, AND MY T.S.U. TIGERS JOIN ME TOMORROW IN VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN AN PLEASE HELP ME GIVE A BIG , HELP ME GIVE A BIG T.S.U. WELCOME TO THE 46TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. (music) JOE BIDEN: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. LET ME START OFF BY THANKING SHEILA JACKSON LEE FOR THE ESCORT INTO TOWN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT TO BE BACK AT TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY. DON'T JUMP, I NEED YOU. DON'T JUMP. AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, GOD LOVE YOU ALL. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TODAY. YOU KNOW, I HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME MEETING WITH SOME OF YOU OUTSTANDING STUDENTBACKS IN SEPTEMBER, I WARNED YOU I WAS COMING BACK AND I'M BACK. I'M BACK. ONE OF THE FINEST OF AMERICA'S HISTORICALLY BLACK UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I'M FROM DELAWARE. DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY. I HAVE TO TELL YOU I ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH, YOU'RE THE SECOND BEST. DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY IS THE BEST. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT BROUGHT ME TO THE DANCE. THEY'RE THE ONES, THAT'S WHERE I GOT STARTED. THAT'S WHY I GOT , LOOK I'M VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT OUR HBCU'S AND MINORITY-SERVING INSTITUTIONS. AS PRESIDENT, EVERYBODY KIND OF FORGETS NOW BECAUSE YOU BECOME SO SIGNIFICANT. EVERYBODY KIND OF FORGETS WHY HBCU'S CAME ALONG IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO TO ANY OTHER UNIVERSITY. WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO TO PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE SIGNIFICANT ENDOWMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY , OTHER UNIVERSITIES HAVE. SO I PROMISE YOU AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA I'M GOING TO FUND HBCU'S BY $70 BILLION OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. SWEAR TO GOD. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE IF YOU LACK THE ENDOWMENTS YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO COMPETE FOR SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT MULTIMILLION, MILLION DOLLAR AND IN SEVERAL CASES BILLION DOLLAR CONTRACTS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTS OUT FOR EVERYTHING FROM GEOPOSITION, LIGHTWEIGHT METALS AND A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. THIS WILL PUT YOU IN POSITION TO COMPETE. ONE THING YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY NOW KNOWS, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING ANYBODY ELSE IN THE NATION CAN DO AND YOU CAN DO IT AS WELL OR BETTER. YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO COMPETE. SO FOLKS , [APPLAUSE] AS I SAID, I WANT TO THANK SHEILA JACKSON LEE AGAIN. ONE THING YOU LEARN WHEN YOU GO TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE AS I DID, I GOT THERE , I'M ABOUT 800 YEARS OLDER THAT SHEILA JACKSON LEE BUT WHEN YOU GET THERE A LITTLE BIT EARLIER SHE CAME AND I TELL YOU WHAT SHE NOT ONLY TOOK THE PLACE BY STORM, SHE FILLED UP A VACUUM. I LEARNED A LONG TIMING TOO , TIME AGO, DON'T ARGUE WITH HER, JUST SAY YES. YES, YES, YES. YOU ARE SOMETHING ELSE. I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. AND SHE NOT ONLY FIGHTS FOR TEXAS, SHE FIGHTS FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S RIGHT. SHE DOESN'T BACK DOWN. SHE KNOWS WHY SHE'S IN IT. WHEN I , WHEN I GOT ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, 29-YEAR-OLD KID, I WASN'T OLD ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN AFTER I WON WHEN THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WON BY 33% OF THE VOTE, I WON BY ,000 VOTES STATEWIDE, NEW CANDIDATES SAID, WHAT'S YOUR SECRET? I SAID I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE SECRET IS. HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT'S WORTH LOSING OVER? HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT'S WORTH LOSING OVER? SHEILA JACKSON LEE HAS NEVER WONDERED ABOUT WHAT'S WORTH LOSING OVER. SHE KNOWS WHY SHE GOT INVOLVED. JUST LIKE , YOU KNOW , SHE'S NOT ONLY , JUST LIKE GARCIA, THE FIRST LATINA TO REPRESENT HOUSTON IN CONGRESS. SHE KNOWS WHY SHE'S INVOLVED. SHE'S ON THE SIDE OF WORKING FAMILIES HERE IN HOUSTON, STANDING UP FOR THE VULNERABLE, FROM HER VERY FIRST DAY AS A LEGAL AID LAWYER. I UNDERSTAND THAT. I USED TO BE A PUBLIC DEFENDER WHEN I WAS A KID, WHEN I GOT OUT OF SCHOOL. HOUSTON IS IN GOOD HANDS WITH SUCH LEADERSHIP AND VISIONARY LEADERS AS YOU HAVE FIGHTING FOR YOU AND THE COMBINATION OF THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN THERE AND HAS GREAT POWER IN THE CONGRESS, THE ONE WHO IS AMASSING POWER FOR THE SAME REASON THEY KNOW WHY THEY'RE INVOLVED. AND THEY KNOW WHY THEY'RE INVOLVED. YOU KNOW, JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, THE PUNDITS DECLARED MY CAMPAIGN DEAD. BUT THEN ALONG CAME SOUTH CAROLINA. [APPLAUSE] SOUTH CAROLINA HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT IT. AS I STAND HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF MINORITY COMMUNITIES, I AM VERY MUCH ALIVE BECAUSE OF YOU. [APPLAUSE] WE NOT ONLY WON IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WE WON EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY ELECTION DISTRICT BECAUSE OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY PRIMARILY IN SOUTH CAROLINA WE ENDED UP INCREASING THE TURNOUT 150,000 MORE PEOPLE THAN EVEN VOTED IN 2008 WHEN BARACK AND I RAN. SO NOW, TOMORROW, TEXAS IS GOING TO SPEAK. [APPLAUSE] AS MY GRANDPA WOULD SAY , WELL, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO WELL HERE IN TEXAS. WITH THE HELP OF ALL OF YOU. AND YOU KNOW, WHEN WE DO, WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY TO DEFEATING DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] LOOK. I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I'M HERE HEART AND SOUL. WITH EVERYTHING I'VE GOT. TO EARN EACH AND EVERY VOTE HERE. I TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED. NOTHING AT ALL. BUT I'M ASKING YOU , I'M ASKING YOU, I'M ASKING YOU FOR YOUR VOTES, I'M ASKING YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO EARN IT. LOOK. MY MESSAGE TO EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED OUT, LEFT BEHIND, THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. WE NEED YOU. WE WANT YOU. AND THERE'S A PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR CAMPAIGN. SO JOIN US. GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM. SIGN UP. VOLUNTEER. CONTRIBUTE IF YOU CAN. BUT WE NEED YOU VERY BADLY. EVERY VOTE MATTERS TOMORROW. MOST IMPORTANT VOTE IS THAT YOU THEN BACK SHEILA JACKSON LEE AS THE NOMINEE WITHOUT ANY QUESTION. THAT'S THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. TOMORROW IS SUPER TUESDAY. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL , I'M RUSHING AHEAD, AREN'T I? I WANT TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO DEMOCRATS HERE IN TEXAS AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, THE MOMENT YOU CHOOSE A PATH FORWARD HAS ARRIVED FOR OUR PARTY. MAYBE SOONER THAN WHEN PEOPLE ANTICIPATED. MAYBE SOONER THAN PEOPLE GUESSED IT WOULD OCCUR OR WANTED IT TO OCCUR BUT IT'S HERE. THE DECISION, THE DECISION DEMOCRATS MAKE TOMORROW AND THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL DETERMINE WHAT WE STAND FOR, WHAT WE BELIEVE, AND WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO AND HOW WE'LL GET THERE. IF DEMOCRATS WANT A NOMINEE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP, KEEP A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND ELECT THE U.S. SENATE , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE HERE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY, THEN JOIN US. THE DEMOCRATS WANT A NOMINEE WHO WILL BUILD ON OBAMACARE, NOT SCRAP IT, THEN JOIN US. BY THE WAY, I WAS ASKED A QUESTION TODAY ON ONE OF THE NEWS PROGRAMS. PEOPLE ARE NOW WORRIED AND THE CORONAVIRUS. I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT LATER BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. THEY GAVE ME AN EXAMPLE THAT IN FACT ONE MAN GOT TESTED, WENT IN TO GET TESTED, HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE HE HAD A COLD, HAD BEEN IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, THEN HE GOT A BILL FOR $3,000. UNDER OBAMACARE WHICH THEY'RE TRYING TO WIPE OUT ALL TESTS ARE FREE. FREE, FREE, FREE. ALL VACCINES WILL BE FREE TO DEAL WITH THESE CRISES. YOU AND IF YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO WILL TAKE ON THE N.R.A. AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS, I'M YOUR GUY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO STAND UP FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND THE WORKING POOR, LOOK, WE'RE GOING TONIGHT ONES TO DO IT. BECAUSE HERE'S THE DEAL. WE'RE NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON ANYBODY IN TERMS OF WORKING FOLKS. AND I MAKE THIS PROMISE AND I CAN KEEP IT. THAT WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE ALL THAT IS NEEDED AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO DO WHAT OTHERS ARE PROPOSING TO GET THINGS DONE, HAVE TO RAISE SIGNIFICANT TAXES ON MIDDLE CLASS FOLKS AND WORKING CLASS FOLKS. YOU KNOW, IF THE DEMOCRATS WANT A NOMINEE WHO IS A DEMOCRAT , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] , A LIFE-LONG DEMOCRAT, A PROUD DEMOCRAT, AND OBAMA-BIDEN DEMOCRAT, THEN JOIN US. LOOK, WE CAN WIN BIG OR LOSE BIG. THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT'S UPON US NOW. WE NEED TO BUILD ON A COALITION OF LEGACY OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT IN ANY OF OUR LIFETIMES, BARACK OBAMA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE'LL DO THIS BY BRINGING AMERICANS TOGETHER REGARDLESS OF RACE, ETHNICITY, GENDER, DISABILITY OR ECONOMIC STATION. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICAN, INDEPENDENTS OF EVERY STRIPE, LOOK, WE DID IT, WE WON IN SOUTH CAROLINA. LIKE I, GOD WILLING, WILL WIN IN TEXAS TOMORROW. LIKE WE'LL DO ALL ACROSS AMERICA. THE COUNTRY IS HUNGRY. HUNGRY, HUNGRY TO BE UNITED. LOOK, WIN BIG OR LOSE BIG, THAT'S THE CHOICE. MOST AMERICANS DON'T WANT A PROMISE OF A REPUBLICLUSION, THEY WANT A GUARANTEE OF RESULTS ON THE THINGS THAT AFFECT THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY WANT TO GIVE ALL AMERICANS ACCESS TO REAL OPPORTUNITY. AFFORDABLE, AVAILABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE. AN ENVIRONMENT WITH CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER AND AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT FRONTS SCHOOLS, PAYS FOR OUR TEACHERS, MAKES COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE, DEALS WITH THE OVERWHELMING DEBT. THE AVERAGE PERSON GRADUATING FROM AN HBCU THIS YEAR WILL GRADUATE $29,000 IN DEBT. WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT. I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO THAT IN A SECOND. WE'RE A NATION, BUT WE HAVE TO STAND UP TO AND BEAT THE N.R.A. AND REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM LIKE YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON A LONG TIME. MOBILIZE THE WORLD AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. A NATION WHERE WE LIVE BY THE VALUES THAT EMBRACES IMMIGRANTS, REFUGEES, ASYLUM SEEKERS. DOES NOT SLAM THE DOOR ON THOSE FLEEING PERSECUTION, VIOLENCE AND OPPRESSION. DOES NOT SEEK TO MAKE PEOPLE SEEKING ASYLUM HAVE TO STAY IN ANOTHER COUNTRY TO DO IT. WE'VE NEVER, EVER , GET CHILDREN OUT OF CAGES. REUNITE FAMILIES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MEAN IT. A NATION THAT PROVIDES A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR 11 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE ENRICHING OUR COMMUNITIES EVERY DAY. WE ARE BETTER FOR IT, NOT WORSE OFF FOR IT. LOOK, WE NEED AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH, LIKE IT DOES TODAY. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. A JOB IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND I REALLY MEAN THIS, AFTER HE LOST A JOB AND DIED, TOOK HIM THREE YEARS TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE TO DELAWARE AND GET A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE WITH FOUR KIDS AND A GRANDPOP LIVING WITH US. MY LORD, I WONDER HOW MY PARENTS LIVED WITH THOSE THIN WALLS, LOOKING BACK ON IT. ANYWAY. THIS IS ABOUT ALL OUR FAMILIES. IT'S ABOUT ALL OUR COMMUNITIES. THE WAY I LOOK AT EVERYTHING, AND I MEAN THIS, I'M CRITICIZED FOR IT OCCASIONALLY. I LOOK AT EVERYTHING THROUGH THE PRISM OF HOW IT AFFECTS YOU, BUT YOUR FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITY, ALL OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT'S WHY I'M A DEMOCRAT. THAT'S WHAT GOT ME INVOLVED IN THE FIRST PLACE. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, FOLKS, TALK IS CHEAP. FALSE PROMISES ARE DECEPTIVE. AND TALK OF REVOLUTION ISN'T CHANGING ANYONE'S LIFE. WE NEED REAL RESULTS AND WE NEED THEM NOW. I'VE DONE THAT MY WHOLE CAREER. AND I'LL DO IT AS PRESIDENT. SO THIS ISN'T AN ELECTION TO SPEND ALL OUR TIME IN THE BATTLE OF THE SOUL FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE'RE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. WE REALLY ARE. THAT'S WHAT GOT ME INVOLVED IN THIS ELECTION. IN THE FIRST PLACE. FROM THE TIME I WAS A KID, I GOVED INVOLVED IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS , I GOT INVOLVED IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. COMING HOME, BY THE WAY, MY STATE, MOST OF YOU DON'T KNOW, MY STATE IS THE EIGHTH LARGEST BLACK POPULATION IN AMERICA. WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT IN COMMON. WE WERE A SLAVE STATE. WE ARE JUST LIKE A LOT OF STATES IN THE SOUTH. EXCEPT WE WERE ONE OF THOSE BORDER STATES. DELAWARE, MARYLAND, THEY WERE ALL , COULD NOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET ON THE OTHER SIDE, THANK GOD. SO, WHEN I WAS A KID, I WORKED WITH WHAT WAS CALLED THE EAST SIDE. I GOT DEEPLY INVOLVED. I SPENT MY TIME IN THE BLACK CHURCH ON SUNDAY, I MUST ADMIT TO YOU, AFTER GOING TO MASS EARLIER IN THE MORNING. [LAUGHTER] MOM, I REALLY DID. NOT A JOKE. BUT WE'D SIT THERE AND WE'D ORGANIZE. AND WE'D DRAW SOME HOPE FROM WHAT WAS GOING ON. WHEN I CAME HOME, I WENT AWAY TO LAW SCHOOL BECAUSE WE HAD NO LAW SCHOOL IN DELAWARE AT THE TIME. WHEN I CAME HOME, DR. KING , I HAVE TWO POLITICAL HEROES. DR. KING AND BOBBY KENNEDY. AND, FOLKS, BOTH WERE ASSASSINATED THE LAST SEMESTER I WAS IN SCHOOL IN LAW SCHOOL. WHEN I CAME HOME AND I HAD A JOB WITH A FANCY LAW FIRM, GOOD LAW FIRM, DECENT PEOPLE. BUT MY CITY, WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, WAS THE ONLY CITY IN AMERICAN HISTORY SINCE THE CIVIL WAR OCCUPIED BY THE MILITARY, FOR 10 MONTHS, STANDING ON THE EAST CORNER WITHDRAWN BAYONETS, AS MY PROFESSOR WOULD SAY, YOU CAN GOOGLE IT. NO EXAGGERATION. AND WHAT HAPPENED? I FOUND MYSELF IN A POSITION WHERE I TALKED ABOUT ALL THIS TIME ABOUT BEING INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY. AND AFTER I GOT ADMITTED TO THE BAR IN JANUARY, I REALIZED I COULDN'T STAY IN THAT LAW FIRM. I COULDN'T , QUIT AND BECAME A PUBLIC DEFENDER. BECAUSE, AND I USED TO INTERVIEW MY CLIENTS DOWN WHAT THEY CALLED THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR, AMTRAK CORRIDOR, THAT GOES FROM ALL THE WAY UP THE COAST, PARTICULARLY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT GOES FROM WASHINGTON TO NEW YORK, AND USED TO INTERVIEW MY COMPLIANTS DOWN THERE AID THOUGHT THINGS WOULD NEVER , CLIENTS DOWN THERE AND I THOUGHT THINGS WOULD NEVER GET BETTER. NEVER GET BETTER. I THOUGHT BLACKS AND WHITES WOULD NEVER BE TALKING TOGETHER AGAIN BECAUSE THE CITY WAS OVER 60% AFRICAN-AMERICAN. WELL, HERE I WAS LITERALLY 40 YEARS TO THE MONTH STANDING ON THAT SAME PLATFORM AT THAT SAME TRAIN STATION, IT HIT ME. I WAS WAITING FOR A BLACK MAN TO COME 26 MILES FROM PHILADELPHIA ON A TRAIN TO PICK ME UP AND TAKE ME A TOTAL OF 147 MILES SOUTH TO WASHINGTON, D.C., TO BE SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO I CALLED MY THREE CHILDREN, GROWN CHILDREN. I CALLED THEM UP WHERE I WAS STANDING AND MY SON WHO WAS A WAR HERO, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE THEN, I SAID, AND I CALLED MY SON HUNTER UP. BO IS MY SOUL, HUNTER IS MY HEART. HE DID THE WORLD TROOP FOOD PROGRAM, U.S.A. AND MY DAUGHTER IS A SOCIAL WORKER. AND RANT LARGEST CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM SYSTEM IN THE STATE. I CALLED THEM UP AND SAID, LOOK, I SAID, LOOK AT THE EAST SIDE OVER HERE. IT'S REBUILT. LOOK OVER AT THIRD STREET BRIDGE. IT'S REBUILT. AND I SAID, DON'T TELL ME THINGS CAN'T CHANGE. I'M ABOUT TO BE PICKED UP BY THIS MAN AND WE ALL CELEBRATED. I THOUGHT I KNEW AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH HATE IN THIS , I THOUGHT COULD YOU DEFEAT HATE. BUT I WAS WRONG. WHAT HAPPENED WAS, IN 2017, THE CHARLOTTESVILLE, CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PICTURE THOSE FOLKS COMING OUT OF THE FIELD WITH THEIR VAINS BULGING, CARRY , VEINS BULLING, CARRYING TORCHES, NAZI BANNERS. DAVID DUKE SAYING, THIS IS WHY WE ELECTED HIM. ACCOMPANIED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED AND THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED TO COMMENT. HE SAID SOMETHING NO AMERICAN PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID. HE SAID, QUOTE, THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. BY THE WAY, IT'S MORE THAN A BOO, IT'S A REALITY. NO PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT. THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED THAT I WAS GOING TO RUN. THAT'S WHY I GOT IN THIS RACE. I WROTE AN ARTICLE IN ATLANTIC MAGAZINE SAYING, WE'RE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE COUNTRY. AND I MEANT IT. BY THE WAY , [APPLAUSE] , IT'S ONLY GOTTEN WORSE FOR HIM SINCE THEN. THE WAY HE MOCKS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE WAY HE TALKS DOWN TO PEOPLE. THE WAY HE TREATS MINORITIES LIKE WE'RE SUBHUMAN. THE WAY HE DEALS WITH US AND SEPARATES US, THE WAY HE EMBRACES DICTATORS AROUND THE WORLD AN POKES HIS FINGER IN THE EYE OF OUR ALLIES. LOOK, HIS VIEW OF WOMEN IS NOT EVEN A VIEW. NO, I REALLY MEAN IT. IT IS , I SHOULDN'T GET GOING. [LAUGHTER] BUT, FOLKS, WE'RE AT A VERY PERILOUS MOMENT. BECAUSE WE CAN, GOD WILLING, WITH THE RIGHT NOMINEE, TURN YOUR CHILDREN'S VIEW OF HISTORY INTO, WELL, FOUR YEARS OF BARACK OBAMA , FOUR YEARS AFTER BARACK OBAMA, HAVING THIS GUY AS PRESIDENT WAS AN ABERRATION, A HISTORICAL ABERRATION. BUT IF WE GIVE HIM EIGHT YEARS, HE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE AND THAT'S A FACT. HE'LL CHANGE THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE. AND WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA. I KNOW A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE AS THE ENEMY. IF WE DO THAT, WE CAN NEVER GET ANYTHING DONE. NOT SEWING MORE DISTINGUISH THAN ANGER. [APPLAUSE] NOT ONLY , THE WORDS OF PRESIDENTS MATTER. NOT ONLY MEANS FIGHTING, BUT HEALING. HEALING THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. BUT WE CAN'T BECOME LIKE THEM. WE CAN'T BECOME LIKE THEM. WE HAVE TO HEAL OUR DIVISION, RE PAIR OUR DEMOCRACY. AND ABOVE ALL, IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO GET BACK UP ON ITS FEET AND ONCE AGAIN FIGHT FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. SOUNDS CORNY. NOT A JOKE. THINK ABOUT IT. ALL MEN AND WOMEN CREATED BY , YOU KNOW THE THING. YOU KNOW HOW WE TALK ABOUT IT. WE THE PEOPLE. FOLKS, INDO YOUED BY OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INDIANA ALIENABLE RIGHTS. WEEK NEVER LIVED UP TO. THAT THOMAS JEFFERSON WHO WROTE THE WORDS NEVER LIVED UP TO IT. BUT WE'VE NEVER, EVER BEFORE WALKED AWAY FROM IT. NEVER. AND I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER IN MY BEING THAT'S WHO WE STILL ARE. WE HAVE ALWAYS MOVED FORWARD. WE'VE ALWAYS INCREASED THE APPER TOUR OF INCLUSION MORE AND MORE. AND WE HAVE A CHANCE NOW, A FEW DAYS AGO I DID A TOWN MEETING IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT ON CNN. I SPOKE WITH THE REVEREND ANTHONY THOMPSON. WHOSE WIFE, MAYA, WAS STUDYING THE WORDS OF THE BIBLE WITH EIGHT OF HER PARISHIONERS AT MOTHER EMANUEL CHURCH WHEN A WHITE SUPREMACIST ENTERING THE CHURCH 4 1\/2 YEARS AGO. AND GUNNED THEM ALL DOWN. IT WAS A WEEKLY ROUTINE, READING SCRIPTURE, FINDING PURPOSE IN FAITH AND GOD AND EACH OTHER. AND IN AN INSTANT, HATE'S VENGEANCE PIERCED THEIR FAITH AND LOST FOREVER. BUT WHAT'S REMARKABLE ABOUT REVEREND THOMPSON AND THE FAMILIES OF THE EMANUEL NINE IS THAT THROUGH THEIR PAIN AND GRIEF, THEY DID SOMETHING TOTALLY REMARKABLE. THEY FORGAVE THE KILLER. THEY FORGAVE THE KILLER. I WAS THERE. THEY FORGAVE THE KILLER. AND IN THEIR FORGIVENESS, CHANGE THAT HAD BEEN FOUGHT FOR FOR OVER 100 YEARS IN SOUTH CAROLINA BEGAN TO OCCUR. THE CONFEDERATE FLAG CAME DOWN. REAL CHANGE BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE. BECAUSE THEY TALKED ABOUT HEALING. THAT SUNDAY I CAME BACK TO MOTHER EMANUEL QUIETLY, NO PRESS, NO ANYBODY. JUST TO SEE TO IT. BECAUSE WE, I JUST LOST OUR SON SIX WEEKS EARLIER. AND MY FAMILY NEEDED TO BE HEALED. SO WE CAME BACK AND WE WORSHIPED BECAUSE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT, IT'S ABOUT HEALING, IT'S ABOUT BEING REMINDED. MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH SIMILAR THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH. SOME OF YOU WORSE THAN I'VE BEEN THROUGH. BUT WHAT DO YOU NEED? YOU NEED PURPOSE IN YOUR LIFE. PURPOSE, REMINDED THAT THOSE YOU LOST ARE STILL PART OF YOU. BO WAS MY SOUL. LIKE WHEN I LOST MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER AND MY TWO KIDS WERE NOT , [INDISCERNIBLE] , WITH EVERY DAY OF EVERY SEASON THAT'S PASSED, REVEREND THOMPSON AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CONGREGATION HAVE GOTTEN UP AND FOUGHT FOR PURPOSE. PURPOSE OF THEIR LIVES. A PURPOSE WORTHY OF THEIR LOVED ONES. WORTHY OF THE BLESSINGS TO LIVE IN THIS REMARKABLE COUNTRY OF OURS. AND THEY'RE THE REASON, THEY'RE THE REASON I'M IN THIS RACE. YOU'RE THE REASON \"NEW YORK TIMES\" THIS RACE. PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT HAVE FOUGHT HERE TODAY, ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY, TO DEAL WITH THE CRISES YOU'VE FACED IN YOUR LIVES. THE DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP'S DIVISIVENESS, I PROMISE YOU, WILL SOON BE OVER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE CAN AND WE MUST BUILD A MORE PERFECT UNION. BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THE ALTERNATIVE. SO LET'S GET BACK UP. WE'RE DECENT, WE'RE BRAVE, WE'RE RESILIENT PEOPLE. WE CAN BELIEVE AGAIN. WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS MOMENT AND WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS PRESIDENT. SO GET UP AND LET'S TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NOTHING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER.

HE HAS INSULTED, DEMONIZED, THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY EMPATHY, COMPASSION. NO REGARD FOR THE VALUES THAT MADE THIS COUNTRY THE WAY WE ARE. NOT THE WAY YOU WERE RAISED BY YOUR MOM AND DAD. HE LACKS THE HONESTY, DECENCY AND RESPECT. HE USES IT AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS. HE DOES NOT BELIEVE WE ARE A BEACON OF THE WORLD. HE DOES NOT BELIEVE WE ARE ALL PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. THAT IS WHY I SAID THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCED THIS CANDIDACY, WE ARE LIVING IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA, NOT SOWING SEEDS OF DIVISION AND ANGER AND HATE. WE HAVE GOT TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND WE WILL, BUT WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE HIM. WE CAN'T HAVE A NEVER ENDING WAR BETWEEN THE PARTIES. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN FIGHT. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, I CAN FIGHT. BUT LOOK, WE NEED AS BADLY, SOMEONE WHO CAN HEAL. WHEN WE PASSED OBAMACARE, WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I DID, SAVING THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, WHAT WE DID TO PASS THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, IT WAS NOT ENOUGH. IT WAS JUST A START.

IT IS NOT ABOUT ME, JILL, OR VALERIE. IT IS ABOUT YOU, ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES. PARAPHRASING ROBERT BROWN.

WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WEARS HIS LARGE AND WARM HEART ON HIS SLEEVE. [APPLAUSE] WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET AND WHAT YOU GET IS EXACTLY WHAT OUR GREAT COUNTRY NEEDS AFTER THREE AND A HALF YEARS OF COERCION, CORRUPTION AND CHAOS OF THE REALITY SHOW ON MAN DONALD TRUMP. LET ME ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WHERE SCIENCE IS ACCEPTED [APPLAUSE] ARE YOU REAL HAPPY WITH THE STABLE GENIUS FOR TAKING CARE OF THE CORONAVIRUS? WHICH LEGACY A BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WHERE TRUMP IS THE RULE? WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A GOVERNMENT THAT YOU CAN BELIEVE AND BELIEVE IN? FINALLY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A GOVERNMENT THAT YOU CONNECT RESPECT? WELL, THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IT WITH PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL GET WITH PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. OUR CANDIDATE HAS A HISTORY OF BOTH PROGRESS AND OF GETTING THINGS DONE , THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN, THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN'S ACT AND GOD BLESS HIM, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, OBAMACARE. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN IS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT CONCERNS US , MEDICATION , EDUCATION, AND EVEN MARRIED A TEACHER, AND I BELIEVE HE WOULD RETIRE BETSY DEVOS. [APPLAUSE] FAIR HOUSING AND HE CAN ALSO RETIRE BEN CARSON. HE WOULD REBUILD THE ENTIRE TOP ECHELON OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ROTATION , PROTECTION AGENCY AND PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT. HE CAN DISASSEMBLE THE CAGES. EFFICIENT AND AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION. HE CAN RETIRE ELAINE CHAO. THAT IS MITCH MCCONNELL'S WIFE. CLOSING THE WEALTH GAP, WORKERS RIGHTS, EQUALITY IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM, SENDING BILL BARR BACK TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. [APPLAUSE] SENDING BILL BARR BACK TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND RESCUING THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FROM A SYSTEM WHERE IF YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW THE PRESIDENT OR CONTRIBUTE ENOUGH MONEY TO THE PRESIDENT FOR IF YOU CAN GET YOURSELF ON FOX NEWS ENOUGH, HE WILL INTERFERE WITH YOUR CRIMINAL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO JAIL FOR THE EYES YOU COMMITTED. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, HEALTH CARE VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WOULD EXPAND ON OBAMACARE THAT WE HAVE ALL COME TO KNOW AND LOVE. THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD SEE AND WHAT YOU WOULD GET. A GOVERNMENT NOT GOVERNED UNDER THE RULES OF DIVISION, SUSPICION, AND EVEN HATRED. THERE IS AN IRISH PROVERB, COMPASSION IS THE BASIS OF ALL MORALITY AND JOE BIDEN IS A COMPASSIONATE AND IMMORAL MAN , AND A MORAL MAN. IF NOT BEFORE, YOU COULD FEEL THIS CRAVING IN THE LAST FEW DAYS AS VOTERS IN STATE AFTER STATE HAVE SPOKEN OUT AND COALESCED AFTER OUR GUIDE, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] EVEN DONALD TRUMP FIGURE IT OUT EARLIER , HE KNEW THAT RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN WAS THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO THEM AND HE GOT IMPEACHED FOR TRYING TO PREVENT IT. I KNOW AND I TESTIFIED THAT WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU WILL GET AND WHAT YOU WILL GET IS A BETTER, SAFER AMERICA. WHILE SERVING AS AN AMBASSADOR, I LEARNED FIRSTHAND THAT EVERYONE ON THIS PLANET UNDERSTANDS THAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. THAT IS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF OUR WEALTH OR BECAUSE OF OUR MILITARY MIND, IT IS BECAUSE OF OUR CREATIVITY AND INGENUITY AND OUR ENERGY AND COMPASSION. WE ARE THE WORLD LEADERS. ALL OF CIVILIZATION LOOKS TO US TO LEAD THEM TO A BETTER LIFE BUT DONALD TRUMP IS TEARING US DOWN ONE AMERICAN CUSTOM AFTER ANOTHER, ONE RELISHED AMERICAN TRADITION AFTER ANOTHER, AND ONE AMERICAN LAW AFTER ANOTHER. [BOOING] [CHANTING] TRUMP IS TEARING DOWN OUR DEMOCRACY. AUTOCRATS ARE ATTRACTED TO HIM AND HE IS THE KIND OF PERSON IS ATTRACTED TO THEM. TRUMP HAS GIVEN INTERNATIONAL OXYGEN TO ALMOST ALL ANTIDEMOCRATIC FORCES AT WORK IN THE WORLD. IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN THAT THE UNITED STATES CANNOT SURVIVE AS AN ISLAND OF DEMOCRACY IN A SEA OF AUTOCRACY. THE TERM RESIDENCY IS LEADING US TO THAT PERILOUS POSITION RIGHT NOW. HOWEVER, THE MOMENT THAT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS WIRE ALLOWED OVER THE OCEANS, THE WORLD WILL KNOW WHEN THEY ANNOUNCE THAT JOSEPH BIDEN HAS BEEN ELECTED OUR 46TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] THEY WILL KNOW THAT WORLD ORDER CAN AGAIN BE ESTABLISHED. OUR FRIENDS WILL KNOW THAT WE ARE NOW BACK IN BUSINESS. OUR FOES WILL KNOW THEY ARE NOT BACK IN BUSINESS. THE CONFUSION ABOUT THE TWO, WHO ARE OUR FRIENDS AND FOES OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS WILL END. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AS VICE PRESIDENT WILL REBUILD ALLIANCES AND RECAPTURE WHAT HAS BEEN CEDED TO OUR ENEMIES AND AS A RESULT, THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD WILL BE A SAFER PLACE. JOE BIDEN WILL RECAPTURE, REKINDLE, AND REFURBISH THE VERY SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY AND THAT IS OUR GREATNESS, NOT BLUSTER, NOT STUPID TWEETS, NOT THIRD-GRADE NICKNAMES, NOT LIES. CONSTANT HARMFUL, HATEFUL LIES. JOE BIDEN HAS NOT FORGOTTEN WHERE HE CAME FROM AND KNOWS WHERE HE IS GOING. GUIDED BY AMERICAN PRINCIPLES THAT WILL MAKE US PROUD AGAIN OF OUR PRESIDENT. SO THE ASK TODAY IS NOT THAT YOU JUST GO TO THE POLLS AND VOTE FOR VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN ON TUESDAY, MARCH 10 , THE ASK IS THAT YOU BRING TO FAMILY MEMBERS , , BRING TWO FAMILY MEMBERS, THREE NEIGHBORS, FOUR FRIENDS. WE NEED MISSOURI TO CONTINUE THE CASCADE AROUND JOE BIDEN THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN RECENT DAYS. WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET BEFORE ACCEPTING VICE PRESIDENCY, JOE BIDEN RECEIVED A PROMISE FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT HE WOULD BE THE LAST PERSON IN THE ROOM WHENEVER A BIG DECISION WAS TO BE MADE. PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD LISTEN TO ALL OF THE ADVISORS AND READ ALL OF THE BRIEFING BOOKS AND WHEN EVERYONE LEFT THE ROOM AND IT WAS DECISION TIME, THEY WERE TOGETHER. THEY FORMED A TRUE PARTNERSHIP AND GOVERNING OUR COUNTRY. ON HIS FINAL DAY IN OFFICE, PRESIDENT OBAMA STATED THAT THE WISEST POLITICAL DECISION HE HAD EVER MADE IN HIS LIFE WAS IN SELECTING JOE BIDEN TO BE HIS VICE PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] SO TESTED, TRUSTED, PRACTICAL, PROVEN, PLEASE GIVE A THUNDEROUS ST. LOUIS WELCOMING , [APPLAUSE] AND A THUNDEROUS ST.

AND RESTORE THE LEADERSHIP ON THE WORLD STAGE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS EMBRACED AUTOCRATS AND DICTATORS LIKE PUTIN AND KIM JONG-UN, BUT I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE AND MET EVERY MAJOR FOREIGN LEADER IN THE LAST 40 YEARS. I PROMISE YOU, I WILL REPAIR OUR ALLIANCES AND MAKE IT CLEAR TO OUR ALLIES THAT WE CAN BE TRUSTED AGAIN. I WILL NOT TREAT NATO LIKE IT IS A PROTECTION RACKET. I WILL BUILD ON THE ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT JUST WEALTH. WALL STREET DIDN'T BUILD THIS COUNTRY, YOU DID, MY DAD DID. HE USED TO SAY JOBS ARE ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT YOUR NIFTY, RESPECT, DECENCY , YOUR DIGNITY, RESPECT, DECENCY. THAT IS WHY I AM A DEMOCRAT IN THE FIRST PLACE. THIS IS NOT AN ELECTION JUST FOR THE SOLE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT FOR AMERICA'S SOUL. UNITING AMERICA, NOT SOWING MORE DIVISION AND ANGER. IT MEANS NOT ONLY FIGHTING BUT HEALING THE COUNTRY. I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS. FINALLY PEOPLE ARE COMING AROUND. WE MUST BEAT DONALD TRUMP IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE TRUMP. PRESIDENTS HAVE TO FIGHT, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO FORGIVE AND THEY HAVE TO JOIN PEOPLE TOGETHER. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO HEAL THE DIVISIONS IN OUR DEMOCRACY. OUR CHILDREN ARE LITERALLY WATCHING.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HERE IS WHY, I DECIDED TO JUMP ON ENDORSED JOE BIDEN. AND DO YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE JOE KNOWS MICHIGAN. JOE CARES ABOUT MICHIGAN AND CARES ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE MICHIGAN ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE KNOW HEALTHCARE IS PERSONAL. RIGHT? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, AS A 29 -YEAR-OLD I BECAME A MEMBER IS KNOWN AS THE SANDWICH GENERATION BIT I WAS SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO GENERATIONS OF MY OWN FAMILY FROM WHOM I WAS THE PRIMARY CAREGIVER. MY MOM WAS DYING OF BRAIN CANCER, MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS A NEWBORN. THAT DOES NOT MAKE ME UNIQUE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE DOING THAT. I WAS ALSO FIGHTING AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT WAS WRONGFULLY DENYING MY MOMS CHEMOTHERAPY. I HAVE COMMISERATED WITH JOE BIDEN ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE BRAIN TUMOR THAT KILLED MY MOTHER IS THE SAME ONE THAT TOOK BEAU BIDEN'S LIFE. I KNOW THAT HE AND BARACK OBAMA EXPANDED HEALTHCARE IN THIS COUNTRY ALMOST 700,000 MICHIGANDERS GOT HEALTHCARE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IF THAT IS NOT PERSONAL ENOUGH TO MANY OF US HERE IN MICHIGAN, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IS. WHEN WE WERE ON THE ROPES, WHEN OUR AUTO INDUSTRY WAS STRUGGLING, WHO HAD OUR BACK? THAT'S RIGHT, BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN PAID THEY CAME TO THE RESCUE WHEN PEOPLE COUNTED AND WHAT PEOPLE SAID LET IT FAIL FAIL, THEY SAID NO, WE ARE IN BECAUSE MICHIGAN IS IMPORTANT. THEY HAD OUR BACKS AND TODAY I SAY LET'S HAVE JOE BIDEN'S BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IN A POLITICAL DISCOURSE WHERE IT IS SO NASTY AND WHERE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO FRACTURE US AND DIVIDE US, BURN BRIDGES, BUILD WALLS, WE NEED SOMEONE WHO WILL BUILD BRIDGES AND THAT IS WHO JOE BIDEN IS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT WE WON IN 2018 BY BIG NUMBERS BECAUSE WHY? WE SHOWED UP WE STAYED FOCUS ON THE DINNER TABLE ISSUES. WE SHOWED A RECORD OF GETTING THINGS DONE AND WE BUILT A COALITION. AS A DEMOCRAT I CAN SAY THIS, I AM PROUD OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT PUT THEIR NAMES ON THIS BALLOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THERE IS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION IN EVERY ONE OF THEM. WHETHER IT WAS PETE BUTTIGIEG OR ELIZABETH WARREN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OR AMY KLOBUCHAR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHETHER IT WAS, I DON'T KNOW, COUPLE OTHER PEOPLE I'M THINKING ABOUT. [LAUGHTER] HOLD ON, I'M GETTING THERE. WHAT I LOVE ABOUT JOE BIDEN THOUGH IS HE KNOWS HOW TO BUILD A COALITION. I'M RIDING WITH BIDEN AND EVERYONE HAS A SEAT TOO. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT IT TAKES COALITIONS TO WIN AND THIS CAMPAIGN LOOKS LIKE THIS COUNTRY AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE STATE AND WITH THAT I AM HAPPY TO INTRODUCE, EXHIBIT A, MY GOOD FRIEND WHO IS HERE TO JOIN US ALL AND TELL US WHY HE DECIDED TO JUMP IN, MY FRIEND THE PHENOMENAL SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY, CORY BOOKER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] (music)(music) [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT, HELLO EVERYBODY! IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK IN DETROIT DETROIT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON, EVERYBODY, BECAUSE THIS MORNING I MADE IT OFFICIAL, I AM HEREBY ENDORSING JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I AM SO PROUD TO BE ON JOE'S TEAM BECAUSE JOE IS ON YOUR TEAM TEAM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I AM SO PROUD TO BE WITH JOE BECAUSE JOE IS WITH ALL OF US. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND WHEN I GET HERE TO DETROIT I FEEL LIKE I GOT DETROIT CRIED BECAUSE MY MOM WAS BORN RIGHT HERE IN THIS CITY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] MY GRANDFATHER, MY GRANDFATHER WORKED IN IN THE ASSEMBLY LINE AND WAS A UAW UNION WORKER AND I'M PROUD OF THAT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ... ... THIS IS THE PARTY OF CIVIL RIGHTS, OF VOTING RIGHTS, OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS, OF WORKERS RIGHTS AND UNION AND SUPPORTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. THE PARTY THAT BELIEVES THIS RADICAL CONCEPT , I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HEARD OF IT , IS CALLED SCIENCE BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO. WE'VE GOT TO TELL THE TRUTH NOW. OUR NATION WHICH EVERY GENERATION WAS TRYING TO MAKE A MORE PERFECT UNION ELECTED PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO RIP US APART. YOU LOOK AT THE MOST VULNERABLE AND HE DOESN'T TRY TO LIFT THEM UP, HE TRIES TO PARE THEM DOWN. IT SEEMS HE TAKES PLEASURE IN PUTTING AMERICANS AGAINST AMERICANS. WE GOT KNOCKED BACK AND KNOCKED DOWN FOUR YEARS AGO LIKE THIS HIGH SCHOOL WHO WAS VERY MASCOT IS THE PHOENIX [CHEERING] IT IS TIME FOR US AS A NATION TO RUN UP. WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, WE DON'T SHUT UP OR GIVE UP, WE STAND UP AND WE RISE UP. [APPLAUSE] AND THERE IS ONE MAN NOW READY TO GO TO THE ARENA WHO IS OUR BEST SHOT TO BE DONALD TRUMP HE IS THE BEST ONE TO HEAL THE SOUL OF AMERICA. HE IS THE BEST ONE TO STAND UP FOR ALL OF US IN AMERICA AND THAT PERSON'S NAME IS JOE BIDEN. YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME SOME HELP, BECAUSE HE CAN'T DO IT ALONE. [APPLAUSE] HELP ME NOW. HE CAN'T DO IT ALONE. WE CAN'T PRAY THAT HE WINS OR HOPE THAT HE WINS AND WE CANNOT WISH THAT HE WINS. WE'VE GOT TO VOTE HIM IN. SO THIS IS ON ALL OF YOU. WE KNOW WHAT THE ANCESTORS SAID WITHOUT A STRUGGLE, THERE IS NO PROGRESS. WE KNOW WE'VE GOT TO TURN OUR ANGER INTO ACTION. THIS WILL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO PROVIDE WHICH WAY DO WE GO DO WE GO TO THE LOW ROAD WHERE WE SEE THATTHE BETTER DAYS OF AMERICA DISAPPEAR UNDER THE SUN OR DO WE GO THE HIGHER ROAD AND PROCLAIM THAT WE ARE A NATION WHERE LIBERTY STILL REIGNS IN AND WHERE EVERY AMERICAN HAS HEALTH CARE AND WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT ENDS THE NIGHTMARE. BRIAN STEVENSON SAID WHERE PEOPLE WORK HARD. YOU CANNOT LOVE YOUR COUNTRY UNLESS YOU LOVE YOUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND WOMEN. I WANT TO ASK YOU RIGHT NOW ARE YOU READY TO WORK FOR JOE BIDEN BUT TOMORROW IT STARTS. I GO TO THE SENATE AND FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT SOME MOMENTUM I SOMETIMES HAVE TO CALL IN TO CLEAN UP BECAUSE I KNOW JOE IS ABOUT TO COME ONTO THE STAGE BUT WE HAVE ONE MORE PERSON THAT IS A RISING STAR IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] LIGHTNING BRINGING THE LIGHT, ONE OF OUR POWERFUL PEOPLE AND I THINK YOU ALL HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE JOE BIDEN WINS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, AND SO ONE MORE VOICE, A VOICE OF CHANGE AND HOPE AND TOMORROW. A VOICE OF TODAY I BRING TO THE STAGE A GREAT SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. [CHEERING] (music)(music) WHAT'S UP, DETROIT! IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK. CAN WE HEAR IT FOR CORY BOOKER. [CHEERING] WE ARE CELEBRATING THE WORK WE ARE ABOUT TO DO FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS. WE'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO, EVERYBODY. MICHIGAN, I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION. I DO BELIEVE THAT. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THIS GREAT STATE, IT IS THE MEASURE OF HOW AMERICA IS DOING AND WHAT AMERICA IS CAPABLE OF DOING. AND WHEN YOU PUT THE KIND OF FIGHT AND WORK THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS PUT INTO INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF AMERICA, WE WILL ELECT JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE JOE IS RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS THAT THIS IS A FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME WE HAVE TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK OURSELVES WHO ARE WE AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS ARE POWERFUL FORCES THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SELL HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US. THEY ARE VOICES THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DIVIDE US AND HELP US TURN AGAINST EACH OTHER AND HERE'S MY THEORY ABOUT IT. I BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN A CONSCIOUS ATTEMPT TO TRY TO DISILLUSION US, TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THE SYSTEM CANNOT AND WILL NOT EVER WORK FOR US, TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THAT WE CANNOT TRUST OUR DEMOCRACY TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THAT WE DON'T MATTER, POWERFUL FORCES THAT CONSCIOUSLY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SAY TO YOU YOU DON'T MATTER, SO DON'T PARTICIPATE, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK A DIFFERENCE. THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY TO US DO NOT TRUST YOUR GOVERNMENT. THEY TRY TO CONVINCE US THAT THEY ARE A LOAN. LET'S SEE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT POWERTHEPOWER IS WITH THE PEOPLE. WHAT WE KNOW IS WE WILL NOT BE OVERLOOKED, AND WE WILL NOT BE CANCELED. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT SAYING WE KNOW WHAT MATTERS AND WE KNOW THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE NOT ACHIEVED THE IDEALS OF THE COUNTRY AND YES, WE ALL KNOW THAT. BUT WE KNOW IF WE STOP FIGHTING WE WILL NEVER GET THERE AND SO WE FIGHT. THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION HAS BEEN ABOUT FIGHTING FOR OUR IDEAS. [CHEERING] LET'S TALK ABOUT THE JOE WE KNOW. I'M PROUD TO ENDORSE JOE BIDEN TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I BELIEVE IN JOE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO REFLECTIVE OF HIS PERSONALITY IS WHEN HE SAYS THERE IS ROOM FOR EVERYONE, BUT THAT IS WHO HE IS. THAT'S REALLY WHAT HE IS. HE'S AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS LIVED A LIFE OF INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO OTHERS. SHE HAD MADE GREAT PERSONAL SACRIFICES IN HIS LIFE. HE IS EXPERIENCED IN LIFE GREAT PAIN AND GLORY. HE UNDERSTANDS WHO PEOPLE ARE. I'VE BEEN IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. DONALD TRUMP, HE DOESN'T GET IT. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT GET IT. HE DOESN'T SEE PEOPLE. THE ONLY PEOPLE HE SEES ARE THE PEOPLE HE LOOKS IN THE MIRROR AND SEES. HE DOESN'T SEE THE PEOPLE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO FEELS, WHO UNDERSTANDS, WHO IS THINKING ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET TO THE END OF THE MONTH WHEN HE'S WORKING TWO JOBS AND HE KNOWS HE'S MISSING HIS SON'S BALLGAME. WE KNOW SOMEBODY IN THE PARKING LOT LOOKING AT THE SLIDING GLASS DOORS OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND KNOWING EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS INSURANCE, IF SHE WALKS THROUGH WITH HER SICK CHILD IS SLIGHTLY OUT OF POCKET MULTIPLE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR HER DEDUCTIBLE. NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS THE COURAGE AND THE POWER TO SEE AND FEEL AND UNDERSTAND THAT AS A SIGN OF STRENGTH AND BEEN LEFT UP TO PEOPLE. THAT IS JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, I GOT TO KNOW JOE BEST THROUGH HIS SON. HOW THE BIG BANG HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN PREDATORY LENDING ACTIVITIES, SO MANY PEOPLE HERE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY LOST THEIR HOMES TO FORECLOSURE CRISIS AND JOE BIDEN STOOD WITH ME EVEN THOUGH THE STATE OF STATE OF DELAWARE HAVEN'T BEEN HIT AS HARD AS SOME OF THE OTHER STATES. I GOT TO KNOW JOE THROUGHBO. IT'S RARE TO SEE SUCH A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A FATHER AND HIS SON. IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP THEY HAD. AND HE SHOWED COURAGE ALL THE TIME AND CONVICTION. HE SPOKE WITH SO MUCH LOVE ABOUT THE FATHER RAISED HIM INTO THE MAN HE WAS. I KNOW JOE AND THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING HIM AND MY FINAL POINT IS MICHIGAN, JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. [APPLAUSE] ECONOMIC JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. HEALTHCARE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. RACIAL JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. AND JOE BIDEN IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. WITH THAT I INTRODUCE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) [CHEERING] [CHEERING] HELLO, DETROIT. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. IT'S NOT ONLY IMPORTANT TO ME, BUT TO SERVE AS ONE OF THE NATIONAL COCHAIRS TO SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE OVER MICHIGAN AND BEYOND MICHIGAN SO, GOVERNOR WHEN I HEAR THAT GREAT LINE JUST FIX THE ROADS, LET'S FIX THE COUNTRY. BECAUSE WE CAN DO THAT AND JUST OVER A WEEK AGO THE PRESS INDEPENDENCE DECLARED THIS CAMPAIGN DEAD. SOUTH CAROLINA SPOKE. THEN THE SUPER TUESDAY SPOKE. THE TURNOUT WAS INCREDIBLE AND NOW TOMORROW, MICHIGAN, MISSISSIPPI, MISSOURI, NORTH DAKOTA, IDAHO, WASHINGTON STATE AND MICHIGAN, I'M COUNTING ON YOU IN A BIG WAY. SENATOR SANDERS LIKES TO SAY WE ARE ONLY GOING TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP BY GENERATING EXCITEMENT AND TURNOUT. ON SUPER TUESDAY WE TURNOUT MORE VOTERS. THEY VOTE FOR US NORTH CAROLINA 19%, TEXAS, 40% MORE VOTERS. I CAN GO ON. BUT FOLKS, HE'S RIGHT WE ARE GOING TO TURN OUT A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT'S BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. THE FACT IS THIS MOVEMENT WE STARTED IS GENERATING IN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT AROUND THE COUNTRY. FOLKS, WE CAN'T CREATE A MOVEMENT WITHOUT THE BASIS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. [INAUDIBLE] I DIDN'T , ARE YOU WITH DONALD TRUMP? CHANTING] THAT'S ALL RIGHT. LET HIM GO. IT'S NOT A TRUMP RALLY. LET HIM GO. FOLKS, LET HIM GO, THAT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. LET HIM GO. THIS IS NOT A TRUMP RALLY. FOLKS , [CHANTING] [CHANTING] \/THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICAN POLITICIANS. LET THEM GO. [CHANTING] I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. IT'S A REFLECTION OF WHAT IS WRONG IN AMERICAN POLITICS TODAY. [CHANTING] THERE IS ONE OTHER THING DONALD TRUMP TELLS GENERATED. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE AS A PARTY OR AS A PEOPLE. WE HAD A LOT OF CRAZY FOLKS AROUND. I'M SORRY, FOLKS. EVERY PERSON THAT HAS BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED, LEFT BEHIND, THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. WE NEED YOU. WE WANT YOU TO BE PART OF OUR CAMPAIGN SO JOIN US. JOIN JOE BIDEN.COM AND SIGN UP. FOLKS, IF YOU WANT A NOMINEE WHO WILL NOT ONLY BEAT DONALD TRUMP BUT KEEP THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , FOLKS YOU WANT A NOMINEE THAT IS GOING TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP, WHEN BACK THE UNITED STATES SENATE, JOIN US. [APPLAUSE] A LIFELONG DEMOCRAT, PROUD DEMOCRAT, OBAMA BIDEN DEMOCRAT, JOIN US TO BRING IT TOGETHER AND NOT TEAR IT APART. WE ARE BUILDING ON A COALITION OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THINGS IN OUR LIFETIME. BARACK OBAMA. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT BY BRINGING IT BACK TOGETHER, BRINGING AMERICA BACK TOGETHER IN EVERY ETHNICITY, RACE, GENDER, ECONOMIC STATION. FOLKS, LOOK WE ARE GOING TO UNITE DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS BUT THAT IS WHAT THE NATION NEEDS IS TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A STATE WE HAVE TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT HERE. HE IS A HELL OF A GUY AND KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING AND I CAN TELL YOU WE WORK SIDE-BY-SIDE TO SUPPORT THE CITY. THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN DETROIT LIKE I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN MICHIGAN. DURINGDURING BEAT OBAMA BY AN ADMINISTRATION, WE LOST THE RESTORATION PROJECT AND INVESTED $2.5 BILLION TO HELP MITIGATE POLLUTION. PROTECTING ENDANGERED SPECIES, HABITATS, THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT OF THE GREAT LAKES IN DECADES AND IT'S DELIVERED AN INCREDIBLE RESULT. REVITALIZATION FOR THE WATERFRONT ALL ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE DRAWING DRAWING INTO NEW BUSINESSES ANDIN THE NEWBUSINESSES AND THE TOURISM ACTIVITY LIKE FISHING AND BOATING ON THE LAKE. FOLKS, YOU ARE THE GREATEST SOURCE OF FRESH WATER AND ALL OF THE WORLD. I'M ACTUALLY DELIVERING FOR MICHIGAN. SO MANY MICHIGANDERS HAVE JOINED US IN THIS DYNAMIC POLITICIAN BUT FIGHT HAS ONLY EXCEEDED BY CHARACTER. THERE ARE SOME AMAZING WOMEN THAT ONE IN 2018 AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE REELECTED. I THINK WE'VE BEEN DELIVERED TO A MOVEMENT WHERE YOU CAN NOT ONLY DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY. IF WE THINK BIG ENOUGH AND BOLD ENOUGH TO BUILD A FUTURE IN THIS NATION, MAKING HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCOUNTABLE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BY MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, LOWERING DRUG PRICES AND ENSURING AND PROTECTING HOSPITALS ARE CLOSING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T LIVE ON JUST MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT. WE SHOULD BE BUILDING ON OBAMACARE INVESTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I'VE DONE IT BEFORE AND I WILL DO IT AGAIN. LEADING THE WORLD TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT OF OUR TIME AND THAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE. I WAS PART OF PUTTING TOGETHER THE CLIMATE ACCORD AND I WANT TO TELL YOU FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS RE- JOIN THAT ACCORD AND SOME OF THE POLLUTERS IN THE UNITED STATES SAY IT'S TIME TO UP THE ANTE. WE ARE 15% OF THE WORLDS PROBLEMS. THE REST OF THE WORLD IF THEY DON'T, IT WON'T MATTER SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE TO DEMAND THE WHOLE WORLD COME WITH US TO ENSURE THE QUALITY SO IT DOESN'T DEPEND ON YOUR ZIP CODE. BY TRIPLING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CALLED FOR SCHOOLS THAT ARE UNDERFUNDED. THERE IS 150,000 TEACHERS TODAY. IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING QUICKLY AND COMPATIBLE WE WILL BE DOWN 2.5 MILLION EXCUSE ME, 300,000 BY THE TIME WE GET TO 2025. BAKING SURE IF WE DO THIS WE CAN SEND EVERY THREE, FOUR, 5-YEAR-OLD TO SCHOOL. REDUCING STUDENT AT BECAUSE IT IS AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN. ALL OF THOSE THAT ENGAGE IN PUBLIC SERVICE INCLUDING TEACHING THAT UP TO 50,000-DOLLAR REDUCTION AND TEACHING IN THEIR STUDENT DEBT. THAT IS WHO WE ARE AND THAT IS WHO WE HAVE TO BE. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD HAS TO CHANGE. THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS EMBRACED EVERY DICTATOR IN THE WORLD. IT'S NOT A JOKE. FROM PUTIN, WE'VE GOT TO REPAIR OUR ALLIANCES. I MEANT EVERY ONE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO MAKE SURE MY JOB IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND THE VICE PRESIDENT. I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE SOLITARY ONE THAT WOULD TRADE PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES IF THEY COULD GUESS WHAT IT'S WE WILL HONOR THE COMMITMENT IF YOU PAY ME MORE MONEY. WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN ASIA WE ARE IN REAL TROUBLE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE TO BRING THE WORLD TOGETHER AS WELL. THEY NEED US. [CHEERING] WE HAVE LOST THE TRUST OF SO MANY OF OUR ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE TO ALSO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK BECAUSE LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT, WALL STREET DIDN'T BUILD AMERICA, YOU BUILT AMERICA. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY AND PLACE IN COMMUNITY AND THE OWN SELF-WORTH BEING ABLE TO LOOK A KID IN THE EYE AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD WHO DON'T THINK THEY CAN SAVE TO THEIR KIDS TODAY. GETTING CRUSHED. THE WORKING POOR ARE GETTING MORE POOR ON THE WAY UP. WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE IT IS ALL ABOUT DECENCY AND DIGNITY AND GIVING PEOPLE A SENSE OF WHO THEY ARE. THAT IS WHY I AM A DEMOCRAT. [CHEERING] I THOUGHT WHEN THEY CAME OUT CARRYING TORCHES CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PICTURE WHAT IT WAS LIKE A COMPANY BY THE KU KLUX KLAN I WROTE AN ARTICLE SAYING WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA AND WE REALLY ARE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. IN ITS MOST PERILOUS MOMENT IT MEANS HAVING TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. YOU CANNOT DEFINE FOR ME BASED ON ETHNICITY AND GENDER, BASED ON RACE, NATIONAL ORIGIN. YOU CAN'T DO IT. WE ARE UNIQUE TO MOST UNIQUE IN ALL OF HISTORY. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS EVER BEEN FOUNDED ON AN IDEA AND THEY ARE. IT DIVIDES US THE WAY THAT HE IS USING US TO SOW DIVISION OF ANGER. PRESIDENTS NOT ONLY HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT, THEY HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO HEAL. [CHEERING] AND FOLKS, WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FELLOW REPUBLICANS THAT ARE AIDING AND ABETTING BUT WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE THEM. WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE THEM. I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE ARE IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF WAR WITH THE PARTY AND ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT IN FACT THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET SOMETHING DONE IS BY CRUSHING THE OTHER TEAM. FOLKS, WE CAN'T GET STUFF DONE IF WE DO THAT. YOU HAVE TO BE READY TO HEAL AND WE CAN'T BECOME LIKE THEM. WE HAVE TO HEAL OUR DIVISION OR ELSE OUR DEMOCRACY IS GOING TO BE IN A JEOPARDY BEYOND WHAT IT IS NOW. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING AND OUR SILENCE IS COMPLICITY. LOOK AT THE WAY HE TALKS AND TREATS PEOPLE, THE WAY THAT HE DEMONIZES PEOPLE AND RIDICULES PEOPLE. WE HAVEN'T HAD A PRESIDENT LIKE THIS. HE HAS A CORROSIVE EFFECT ON THE COUNTRY AND ON OUR CHILDREN. THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" REPORTED WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THE REPORTS IN SCHOOL OF KIDS MIMICKING THE BEHAVIOR. SINGLING OUT EMIGRANTS FOR RIDICULE AND HARASSMENT. WHAT DID WE THINK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FOR THIS MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN TEACHERS TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS IT ANY SURPRISE KIDS WOULD SAY THIS IS THE REPORT OF A STUDY DONE BY THE \"WASHINGTON POST,\" WHILE THE PRESIDENT. NO MATTER WHO THE PRESIDENT IS, WHETHER FOR GOOD OR BAD AND THE WORDS HE UTTERS HAS A CORROSIVE EFFECT AND LOOK, FOLKS I'VE SAID IT MANY TIMES IN THIS CAMPAIGN WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME DONALD TRUMP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE OUR KIDS READ ABOUT IT TEN YEARS FROM NOW BUT IF WE GIVE HIM EIGHT YEARS HE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE IN A FUNDAMENTAL WAY. [CHEERING] THE WORLD IS WATCHING LOOKING AT US INTO SAYING WHAT AND SAYING WHAT IS GOING ON IN AMERICA. EMBRACE OUR ENEMIES, WALK AWAY FROM OUR CLOSEST ALLIES. WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THAT SO THEY KNOW ONCE AGAIN THE UNITED STATES CAN BE TRUSTED. THAT'S FOR OUR SECURITY ECONOMIC AS WELL AS SECURITY. FUTURE GENERATIONS ARE WATCHING AND IN THE YEARS TO COME YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK AT THIS MOMENT AND SAY WHEN IT MATTERED MOST, WHAT DID THEY DO? DID IT SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY OR WERE THEY PART OF THE PROBLEM AND NOW IN THIS MOMENT WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH FEAR IN THIS COUNTRY, SO MUCH FEAR IN THE COUNTRY AND WE HAVE THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE IN FACT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS CALLED INTO QUESTION, WE NEED HONEST TRUSTED, TRUTHFUL LEADERSHIP AND THAT IS WHAT I PROMISE YOU I WILL PROVIDE. [APPLAUSE] IT'S TIME TO GET BACK UP AND ONCE AGAIN FIGHT FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT WE HOLD TO BE SELF-EVIDENT AND FIGHT FOR THE NOTION THAT AMERICA HAS TO LEAD THE WORLD TO THIS NEW GENERATION. I VIEW MYSELF AS A BRIDGE, NOT AS ANYONE ELSE. WHEN I ANNOUNCED THE CANDIDACY IN PHILADELPHIA AND SAID I THAT I WANTED TO DO IT IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE THE DECLARATION AND THE CONSTITUTION WERE FIRST UNVEILED UNVEILED. ALTHOUGH WE'VE NEVER LIVED UP TO THOSE ASPIRATIONS WE'VE NEVER BEFORE WALKED AWAY FROM IT. I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SAVE EVERY SINGLE PRESIDENT AND MOVE THE ARK OF INCLUSION WIDER AND WIDER. WE CAN'T LET IT SHUT DOWN. THE DAYS OF THE DIVISIVENESS ARE SOON GOING TO BE OVER. AND WHEN HE IS GONE WE WILL COME BACK WE ARE A LITTLE OVER A WEEK FROM ST. PATRICK'S DAY SO IT'S ONLY APPROPRIATE BUT I QUOTE HISTORY TEACHES US BUT THEN ONCE IN A LIFETIME IT RISES UP AND WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO MAKE OPEN HISTORY RISE. WE'VE GOT TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE FAIL TO FAILED TO DO WHEN WE SET OUR MINDS TO IT. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE AMERICANS CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION AND TRUTH OVER LIES. SO LET'S TAKE THIS BACK NOW. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. TAKE IT BACK. IT'S TIME. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music)(music) [CHEERING] [CHEERING] [CHEERING] IT COMES OUT TO BE A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH WE HAVE ONE CANDIDATE STANDING UP TO THE WORKING-CLASS AND MIDDLE-CLASS WE ARE GOING TO WIN THAT ELECTION. THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. A LOOK AT EFFORTS TO COMBAT GLOBAL DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS AND PROPAGANDA, PARTICULARLY FROM CHINA AND RUSSIA.

RATED BY CABLE IN 1979 AND BROUGHT TO YOU TODAY BY YOUR TELEVISION PROVIDER. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, JOE BIDEN ON GUN VIOLENCE. HE SPOKE AND A EVENT WITH VOTERS AND SUPPORTERS AT COLUMBUS OHIO. THIS RUNS 35 MINUTES. [BACKGROUND SOUNDS]. [APPLAUSE]. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE, IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU ALL TODAY. TO SUPPORT JOE BIDEN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE]. ON BEHALF OF BRADY, I AM THRILLED TO SHARE IN OUR COMMITMENT TO THIS CAMPAIGN AND TO ENSURING THAT JOE BIDEN DEFEATS DONALD TRUMP IN NOVEMBER. BRADY IS ONE SINGULAR MISSION AND THAT IS TO END GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. JOE BIDEN, SHARES THAT GOAL AND A BINDING ADMINISTRATION WILL MAKE IT A PRIORITY ON DAY ONE. THERE IS NO CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE AS COMMITTED TO THIS CAUSE AS JOE BIDEN. THAT IS BECAUSE VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN KNOWS, THAT THE GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC IN OUR COUNTRY IS A TRUE BUT PREVENTABLE CRISIS. HE KNOWS THAT WHEN WE SAY, 100 PEOPLE A DAY, DIE FROM GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY, IT IS 100 FATHERS, MOTHERS, SISTERS, AND BROTHERS. THAT IS 100 PEOPLE TOO MANY. IT'S HUNDREDS OF LIVES, RIPPED APART IN EVERY COMMUNITY ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. COMMUNITIES LIKE RIGHT HERE IN COLUMBUS. JUSTICE EATS FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW, DIAZ WAS SHOT AND KILLED LAST AUGUST WHILE DRIVING BY THIS VERY COMMUNITY CENTER . VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN TESTING IS A CLOSE. AS A SENATOR AND AS A VICE PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN HAS MOURNED WITH ALL AMERICANS AND IN TIMES OF CRISIS, AND TRAGEDY. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, HIS BLOOD, TO ENSURE THAT THOSE MOMENTS ARE NEVER REPEATED. HISTORY STRETCHES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE 1990s AND THEN SENATOR BIDEN WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN PASSING OUR NATION BACKGROUND CHECKS SYSTEM THE BRADY BILL. WHICH IS NOW STOPPED MORE THAN 3.5 MILLION SALES OF FIREARMS. JOE BIDEN, HIS LEADERSHIP ALSO HELP TO PASS THE FEDERAL BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS. STOPPING THE SALE AND MANUFACTURE OF WEAPONS OF WAR IN THIS COUNTRY. IN 2005, HE VOTED AGAINST THE PROTECTION OF LAWFUL AND COMMERCE, WHICH GIVES THE GUN INDUSTRY UNPRECEDENTED PROTECTIONS UNDER LAW. HE WAS THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, THE LOCKET IS MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ESCAPE FROM AND FIND SUPPORT AFTER SITUATIONS AS INTIMATE PARTNER AND FAMILY VIOLENCE. AS A SENATOR, JOE BIDEN KNEW THE VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY DOESN'T TOTALLY OCCUR OUTSIDE OF THE HOME. IN THE AFTERMATH, THE MASS SHOOTING AT SANDY HOOK, IN NEWTOWN CONNECTICUT, AND THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND FACING A CONGRESS THAT REFUSED TO ACT TO STOP MORE MASS KILLINGS, PRESIDENT OBAMA, NEEDED A CHAMPION TO LEAD THE ADMINISTRATION GUN VIOLENCE TASK FORCE. HE NEEDED SOMEBODY TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA. HE NEEDED SOMEONE WHO HAD FOUGHT THE NRA, AND ONE. THAT SOMEONE WAS JOE BIDEN. THAT SOMEONE IS JOE BIDEN BECAUSE HE IS STILL FIGHTING EVERY SINGLE DAY. IN THIS CAMPAIGN, JOE BIDEN HAS VISITED AND SPOKEN WITH COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES AFFECTED BY GUN VIOLENCE AND WITH SURVIVORS. HE HAS MET WITH THEM . HE HAS MOURNED WITH THEM, HE KNOWS US. A BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WILL FIGHT FOR A NEW ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. HE WILL EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN THE BABY BRADY BACKGROUND CHECKS AND HE WILL REPEAL AND ENSURING THAT WE CAN HOLD THE GUN MANUFACTURERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROFITING OFF OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY. JOE BIDEN WILL TAKE THE FIGHTS TO THE GUN INDUSTRY THROUGH THE NRA AND HE KNOWS HOW TO WIN. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS BY THIS CAMPAIGN, WHO HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED OUT, OR LEFT BEHIND. IT IS WHY HE IS IN THIS FIGHT AND HIS WIFE WE ARE IN IT WITH HIM. I WANT MY DAUGHTERS KATIE AND SOPHIA, TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THEY ARE FREE FROM THE FEAR OF GUN VIOLENCE. THERE ARE TOO MANY CHILDREN IN OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE IN CONSTANT FEAR IN THEIR SCHOOLS, IN THEIR HOMES, AND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE OWE ALL OF THEM A BETTER FUTURE. THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WITH A RECORD, WITH THE COMMENCEMENT, WITH THE PLAN, AND WITH THE HEART. TO CREATE THAT FUTURE FOR OUR KIDS. THAT SOMEONE IS JOE BIDEN. HE KNOWS US, HE KNOWS WHAT WE NEED TO END THIS EPIDEMIC. WE KNOW HIM. AND WE KNOW THAT IS THE ONLY ONE IN THIS FIGHT THAT CAN GET IT DONE. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE]. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MY NAME IS SHANNON AND I AM THE FOUNDER OF MOMS COMMAND ACTION. THE GRASSROOT GUN SAFETY AND YESTERDAY OUR ORGANIZATION WAS SO THRILLED AND HONORED TO ENDORSE VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT. THE CHOICE WAS CLEAR. WHILE EVERY CANDIDATE LEFT IN THE RACE SAYS THEY WILL TAKE ACTION ON GUN SAFETY AS PRESIDENT, ONLY ONE OF THEM HAS A TRACK RECORD TO PROVE THAT HE WILL ACTUALLY PRIORITIZE GUN SAFETY ACT ON AND WHEN. AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF TAKING ON THE NRA AND WINNING. IN FACT, MANY PEOPLE REFER TO ME AS THE NRA WORST NIGHTMARE. I WOULD SAY THAT IS NOT TRUE, IT IS JOE BIDEN. HE HAS HELPED PASS THE BILL IN 1994 THAT ESTABLISHED THE MODERN DAY BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM. IN HIS STEP NOW OVER $3M PROHIBITED PURCHASES FROM GETTING GUNS. HE WROTE THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. THE BILL THAT WAS NOT A PHRASE THIS YEAR BECAUSE REPUBLICANS REFUSE TO SUPPORT A PROVISION IN IT. IT WAS DISARMED CONVICTED STOCKERS AND DATING PARTNERS. AND GUESS WHO ALSO OPPOSES THAT POSITION. THE NRA. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN ALSO OPPOSES GRANTING IMMUNITY TO THE GUN INDUSTRY A LAW THAT SINCE 2005, HAS PROTECTED GUN MANUFACTURERS FROM BEING HELD LIABLE FOR CRIMES COMMITTED WITH THE PRODUCTS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO A FUTURE PRESIDENT BIDEN, REPEALING THAT LAW. AND IN 2012, AFTER THE HORRIFIC SHOOTING AND SENDING A, IT WAS VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WHO PRESIDENT OBAMA ASKED TO LEAD HIS GUN SAFETY TASK FORCE. SOMETHING HE HAS REMAINED COMMITTED TO FOR YEARS. DESPITE BATTLING A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS, BEHOLDEN TO THE NRA. AND THAT IS WHEN I FIRST MET JOE BIDEN IN 2013, ALONG WITH SO MANY MOMS AND ACTION VOLUNTEERS AND WE KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE OUR CHAMPION. HIS COMMITMENT TO REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE ISN'T WITHOUT PARALLEL, WHICH IS WHY HE'S PRIORITIZE GOOD SAFETY IN HIS CAMPAIGN, AND IS PLEDGED ACTION, AND THE FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE. HE ALSO UNDERSTANDS THE IMPACT OF CITY GOING VIOLENCE AND HIS PLAN IS PRESIDENT, WOULD IMPROVE OR INCLUDE A 900-DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN LOCAL PILOT INTERVENTIONS AND INTERRUPTION PROGRAMS. WE KNOW JOE BIDEN. WE KNOW THERE IS NO STOPPING THE VICE PRESIDENT WHEN IT COMES TO KEEPING OUR FAMILIES SAFE. AND THERE IS NO STOPPING OUR MILLIONS OF VOLUNTEERS SUPPORTERS AND GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS, FROM GETTING HIM INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. JOE BIDEN KNOWS THE MOTHERS AND WOMEN ARE ORGANIZING IN AMERICA. IN MY WORKING TOGETHER, BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER, WE WILL STOP THE GUN LOBBY DANGEROUS AND PAST FIVE SENDING FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE WAITED FOR DECADES. THE MOMENT IS FINALLY HERE AND MOMS DEMAND ACTION GRASSROOTS ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS WILL FIGHT LIKE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE]. MY NAME IS CRYSTAL. I AM HERE TODAY TO HONOR MY SON AND MY DAUGHTER. THEY WERE BOTH SHOT AND KILLED ON APRIL 1st, 2015, BY THE HUSBAND, BECAUSE OF THE PENDING DIVORCE. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT CAN NEVER PREPARE YOU FOR GETTING THE CALL TO LEARN THAT YOUR WORLD HAS JUST BEEN SHATTERED. NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE. MY CHILDREN WERE SMART AND KIND AND HARD-WORKING. THEY WERE COMMITTED TO THEIR COMMUNITY. MY DAUGHTER HAD OPENED A CHILDCARE BUSINESS WHICH WHICH WE RAN HIS FAMILY TOGETHER. AND SHE HAD ALSO BEEN NAMED THE 2015 COLUMBUS SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OF THE YEAR AWARD . JUST SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE HER MURDER. I WILL ALWAYS BE PROUD TO BE THE MOTHER. HOWEVER ALL OF THAT WAS STOLEN FROM ME IN AN INSTANT. I AM NOW RAISING HER TWO CHILDREN AND MY GRANDSON IS HERE WITH ME TODAY. AND I TRY HARD TO CELEBRATE HER LIFE SO THEY UNDERSTAND JUST HOW SPECIAL THEIR MOTHER AND PINNACLES WORK. SEE TODAY WE STAND HERE SEVERAL WEEKS FROM WHAT WOULD BE HIS MOTHER'S 33rd BIRTHDAY. AND SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THAT, WILL ALSO CELEBRATE THE FIFTH YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF HIS MOTHER AND HIS UNCLES PASSING. AS BROKENHEARTED AS I AM, I TRY TO CELEBRATE MY CHILDREN'S LIVES SO THAT MY GRANDCHILDREN KNOW THE MOTHER AND UNCLE WERE SPECIAL. AND THEY WERE LOVED. NO ONE, NO ONE, DESERVES THE PAIN IN MY FAMILY I HAVE LIVED EVERYDAY. I NOW LIVE A LIFE CLEAR BIOLOGICALLY, I AM MY GRANDCHILDREN'S GRANDMOTHER, LEGALLY THE LAW DEFINES ME AS THEIR GUARDIAN. AND EMOTIONALLY, I AM MOTHER, AND MOMMY TO ONE AND YAYA AND MOMMY TO ANOTHER. THAT SHOULD NOT BE MY STORY. I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ELECTING JOE BIDEN AS PRESIDENT, GIVES US ONE STEP CLOSER TO ENDING THIS GUN VIOLENCE. I HAVE THE HONOR OF MEETING VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN ON SEVERAL PREVIOUS OCCASIONS AND I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND HOW DEEPLY HE EMPHASIZES THE GUN SURVIVORS. JOE BIDEN UNDERSTANDS THE LEGAL CONNECTION BETWEEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND EASY ACCESS TO FIREARMS. IN HIS WORK TIRELESSLY TO PROTECT VICTIMS OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. MY DAUGHTER. AND KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF DOMESTIC ABUSERS. JOE BIDEN KNOWS HOW TO KEEP THE NRA HAS PLANNED TO DO IT AGAIN. MOMS DEMANDING ACTION, VOLUNTEERS AND GUN SURVIVORS, SOME OF WHOM ARE STANDING BEHIND ME TODAY. OUR ALL IN FOR JOE BIDEN BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN ABLE, HE IS BEEN ALL IN DECADES. I AM GRATEFUL FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND READY AND DETERMINED TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE HIM OUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT, I BRING YOU OUR NEXT PRESIDENT FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE]. LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT I HAVE A SENSE EXCUSE ME. BECAUSE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE A TRAGIC LOSS, MATTER HOW LONG AGO IT WAS, WASN'T VERY LONG AGO IN THE CASE WHEN YOU BRING ENOUGH EVERYTHING COMES BACK. HE READ OF IT. YOU RELIVE THAT MOMENT. I ADMIRE YOUR COURAGE AND I WISH I HAD THE COURAGE YOU HAD YEARS AGO WHEN MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KILLED. NOBODY GUN BUT IT TRAGIC INCIDENT. FOLKS WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR FOR THE PAST FOUR INTO TOWN AS WELL AS FOR HIS SUPPORT. HE IS THE COURAGE TO STAND UP, ALONG WITH MANY OF THE MAYORS, TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. JOE BIDEN. WE HAVE TO MOVE. WE ARE HERE TODAY, BECAUSE THIS COMMUNITY DRIVING PART, IN EVERY COMMUNITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAS SUFFERED GREATLY TO THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE. ON AVERAGE, 526 OHIO ANTS, ARE KILLED BY GUN VIOLENCE EVERY SINGLE YEAR. JUST AS HOMICIDES. GUNS ARE THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR CHILDREN AND TEENS. NATIONALLY WE LOSE 100 PEOPLE TO GUN VIOLENCE EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND IT'S INTOLERABLE. AND WE SEEM TO ACCEPT IT AS NORMAL. WE SEEM TO RESIGN THEMSELVES TO THAT. FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY GUN VIOLENCE, NORMAL IS A LIVING NIGHTMARE. FOR FAMILIES IN DAYTON, WHO LEARNED LAST YEAR WHEN MEANS TO HAVE A MASS SHOOTING RIP THROUGH THE COMMUNITY, NORMAL IS UNACCEPTABLE. FOR FAMILIES RIGHT HERE IN THIS COMMUNITY, AS LOSSES DON'T MAKE HEADLINES AND NATIONAL NEWS EVERYDAY, BUT THE GRIEF IS JUST AS DEEP. NORMAL IS AN INSULT. THE DIGNITY AND PRIDE OF THE COMMUNITIES, IT DID DISHONOR THE VALUES OF THE LIVES, AND CHRIS AND SHARON AND CRYSTAL, THANK YOU FOR NOT JUST WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND ENDORSING ME BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY IMPORTANTLY FOR SHARING YOUR STORIES. I AM SO DEEPLY HONORED TO BE JOINED BY YOU AT THIS MOMENT. THESE WOMEN ARE DRIVING GRASSROOTS ACTIONS MOBILIZING OUR COMMUNITIES THE WEIGHT THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED BEFORE. I'M OFTEN ASKED, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT I CAN GET THESE THINGS DONE NOW. AND IT WILL BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE STANDING BEHIND ME. BECAUSE OF THE GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT THAT OCCURRED AND IS OCCURRING NOW. FOLKS, THERE'S A LOT TO BE DONE. AS I SAID, THESE WOMEN ARE DRIVING THE GRASSROOTS ACTIONS, MOBILIZING THEIR COMMUNITIES AND GALVANIZING NATION TO ACTION. I KNOW A LOT OF TIMES, I GET ASKED WITH A OF PEOPLE, HAVE TRIED ABOUT GUN SAFETY REFORMS AND THEY HAVE FAILED. WHAT IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME. THE ANSWER IS STANDING AGAIN BEHIND ME. IT IS NOT JUST WOMEN DEMANDING ACTION, SOUGHT JUST BRADY, IS NOT JUST THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BEHIND ME. IT IS ALSO THE YOUNG PEOPLE. I WAS THERE, I WASN'T VICE PRESIDENT. I WAS UP AT WASHINGTON WHEN ALL OF THIS COULD COME UP WITH THEIR PARENTS FROM DOWN IN FLORIDA. WITHOUT HORRIFIC INCIDENT TOOK PLACE. I LOOK TO THE FACES OF THESE KIDS. IN THEIR DETERMINATION. IN THE FEAR THAT THE CONGRESSMAN OF HAVING TO MEET WITH THEM. AND LOOK THEM IN THE EYE. THESE KIDS EMERGING FOR THEIR LIVES. STRAIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. RIGHT THROUGH ENOUGH TO THE DOORS OF CONGRESS. DEMANDING CHANGE. I PROMISE YOU, IT MATTERS. ANSWER IS THE REASON WHY WE WILL WIN, IS BECAUSE ALL OF YOU BEHIND ME. THIS MOVEMENT ISN'T BEING LED TO WASHINGTON, IT IS GOING UP FROM THE GROUND IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. JUST LIKE THIS ONE. ALL ACROSS AMERICA, IT CAN'T BE BOUGHT OR INFLUENCED BY GUN MANUFACTURERS, IT CAN'T BE SWAYED BY THE NRA, THAT'S WHY THE CITY CURIOUS PEOPLE IN AMERICA, FOR THE NRA. THEY ARE FOLKS LIKE SHARON AND CHRIS. SCORES OF VOLUNTEERS LIKE CRYSTAL. WHO HAD THEIR LIVES DEVASTATED BY GUN VIOLENCE. RETURNING THE PAIN TO PURPOSE. WE TALKED A WHILE AGO CRYSTAL, AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW U.S. ME, HOW I WAS HANDLING IT MY CIRCUMSTANCES. AND I SAID YOU GOT TO FIND PURPOSE. BOTH OF YOUR CHILDREN, ARE LOOKING DOWN NOW. I BELIEVE IT. BECAUSE YOU HAVE PURPOSE. IN YOUR HELPING OTHERS. HELPING CHILDREN. OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS. I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO LOSE A CHILD. I KNOW THE GRIEF IS OVERWHELMING. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BEING SUCKED INTO A BLACK HOLE IN HER CHEST BUT NO WAY OUT PRETTY JUST FEEL LIKE YOU ARE BEING CONSUMED. FINDING PURPOSE, MOST PEOPLE I SPEAK TO FIND, IS SOMETHING THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO BREATHE AGAIN. FINDING WORK TO GET YOU UP EVERY MORNING, MOTIVATE YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT MATTERS. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON IS GOING TO HAVE YOUR BACK AND, I MEAN. IT OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER WILL NOT ABIDE STANDING BY AND NOT DOING ANYTHING. WHILE THOUSANDS OF LIVES ARE CUT SHORT BY GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. AS PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU I WILL ACT. I HAVE BEATEN NRA BEFORE, TWICE. MEANINGFUL GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WE CAN DO IT AGAIN. AND I AM INCREDIBLY PROUD. ... ... ... IF I COULD HOLD FOR JUST A SECOND TIER, I AM NOT OPPOSED TO THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS AN ABSOLUTE IF ONE OF YOU INHERENT YELLS FIRE, AND SOMEONE GETS HURT, THEY CAN BE SUED, IT IS NOT FREE SPEECH YOU ARE PUTTING PEOPLE IN DANGER. PUTTING PEOPLE IN DANGER. IN THE VERY BEGINNING THE SECOND AMENDMENT DID NOT SAY ANYBODY CAN OWN ANY KIND OF WEAPON. THE IDEA OF SOME OF MY FRIENDS AND FOLKS I ENCOUNTER SAY THE TREE OF LIBERTY IS WATERED WITH THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS. THEY NEED HELLFIRE BY THE GOVERNMENT. AR-15 IS NOT GOING TO DO IT. IT IS NOT GOING TO PROTECT THEM. YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT STRAIGHTER, A SHOTGUN WILL HELP YOU A LOT BETTER. MY POINT IS, EVEN THE MEMBERS OF THE NRA, THE MAJORITY NO AR-15 AND CLIPS WITH 30, 40 COUNT OF 50, 100 ROUNDS AND IT MAKE NO SENSE. YOU ARE NOT ONLY THE NRA OUT THERE YOU'RE CHANGING IDEAS OF THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE NRA. SIGNIFICANT RATIONAL PEOPLE. AND I COMPLEMENT YOU FOR. AS PRESIDENT, I AM NOT GOING TO JUST GET US TO UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS, CLOSING THE ONLINE LOOPHOLE, WE ARE ALSO GOING TO CLOSE THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE SO YOU CANNOT HAVE THE TIME RUN OUT TO ALLOW YOU TO GET A GUN. YOU ALL KNOW HOW IT WORKS BUT MOST EVIL DON'T KNOW. THE BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM THERE SOMETHING CALLED THAT NICK'S SYSTEM. SUPPOSEDLY, NOT SUPPOSEDLY BUT EACH OF THE STATES ARE SUPPOSED TO TAKE ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE DISQUALIFIED FROM OWNING A GUN, SEND THEIR NAME AND MATERIAL TO THIS NATIONAL REGISTRY. AND THEN, WHEN YOU GO TO PURCHASE A WEAPON, AT THAT GUN SHOP THEY'D CHECK IN AND GO TO THE NIXON SAKE CAN THIS PERSON OWN A WEAPON OR NOT? THE PROBLEM IS NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE UPDATED THEIR RECORDS. AND THE IDEA THAT YOU CANNOT WAIT A MATTER OF MINUTES OR A DAY, TO BE ABLE TO OWN THAT GUN, IS BIZARRE. THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE IS THE LOOPHOLE THAT SAID YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT WITHIN 24 HOURS, IF IT DOESN'T COME BACK ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, YOU CAN AUTOMATICALLY PURCHASE THE GUN. WE ARE GOING TO CLOSE THAT BOYFRIEND LOOPHOLE. WHEN THAT VIOLENCE AGAINST ACT THAT SET ABUSERS HUSBANDS OR SOMEONE YOU HAVE A CHILD WITH IS AN ABUSER, THEY CANNOT OWN A FIREARM IF THEY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF ABUSING YOU THERE'S THIS THING CALLED THE BOYFRIEND LOOPHOLE. THEY WERE TRYING TO GET PAST. IF YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND, WHO YOU HAVE NOT HAD A CHILD BY, AND HE BEAT YOU ALL THE TIME, HE HAS BEEN GIVEN A STAY AWAY ORDER, HE CAN STILL OWN A WEAPON. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WOMEN ARE KILLED, ARE KILLED WITH A GUN. BY THEIR PERPETRATOR. WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE ABUSERS. HOW IN GODS NAME AND THE PRESIDENT NOT UNDERSTAND THAT? WE ARE GOING TO GET WEAPONS OF WAR OFF THE STREETS. THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS NOW COMMON IS NOT BEEN GIVEN LIMITS. NO ONE NEEDS AN AR-15 OR 100 ROUNDS IN A MAGAZINE TO GO HUNTING OR FOR SELF-DEFENSE IT IS DESIGNED FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO KILL, KILL QUICKLY AND BRUTALLY. THINK BACK TO LAST AUGUST THINK BACK TO A NATION REELING FROM THE HORRORS OF A LATINO COMMUNITY BEING SPECIFICALLY TARGETED BY GUNMEN IN EL PASO. IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS, BEING HIT AGAIN. POLICE WERE ON THE SCENE WITHIN 20 SECONDS. LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT NOW, IT WITHIN 20 SECONDS THEY DID THEIR JOB. IT TOOK ONLY TEN MORE SECONDS FOR THEM TO TAKE DOWN THE SHOOTER. BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE USING AR-15 STYLE WEAPON, FITTED WITH 100 ROUND MAGAZINE OPENING FIRE. IN JUST 30 SECONDS, HE WAS STILL ABLE TO KILL NINE PEOPLE AND INJURED 27. LET ME SAY IT AGAIN. ASSAULT WEAPONS AND HIGH-CAPACITY WEAPONS IS NO PERSON THAN OTHER TO KILL QUICKLY AND AS BRUTALLY AS POSSIBLE. NO ONE NEEDS THEM. WORKING WITH SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN WE GOT THAT VANDEN HIGH-CAPACITY MAN FOR TEN YEARS. THEN WE HAD THAT THING WITH HANGING CHADS IN FLORIDA. WE LOST AN ELECTION. AND PRESIDENT BUSH LET IT EXPIRE, IT HAD TO RENEW. THE ONLY WAY TO GET PAST THE FIRST TIME AROUND. IT PASSED AT THE TIME DESPITE PRESSURE FROM THE NRA. MY POINT IS WE CAN DO THIS AGAIN. ANYTHING LESS IS AN INSULT TO THE FAMILIES ACROSS THE NATION THAT HAVE BEEN TERRORIZED BY GUN VIOLENCE. ON DAY ONE OF MY PRESIDENCY I'M GOING TO SEND A BILL TO CONGRESS REVOKING ONE OF THE BIGGEST GIVEAWAYS IN HIS REPORT WE ARE GOING TO END THE CIVIL LIABILITY THAT'S GIVEN TO GUN MANUFACTURERS. AND BY THE WAY, THINK ABOUT THAT FOR SECOND PERIOD IF I STOOD UP AND SAID BY THE WAY WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT NO CIVIL LIABILITIES FOR DRUG DRUG COMPANIES TO PUT 9 BILLION PILLS OUT ON THE MARKET YOU TO JOE THAT MAKE SENSE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BUILD A SUIT TOBACCO COMPANY'S FOR LYING TO US ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THEIR PRODUCT. WHAT ARE WE DOING? RIGHT NOW, GRIEVING FAMILIES DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE THE COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURED THESE GUNS, FALSE ADVERTISING THAT CAUSES SO MUCH CARNAGE. WE DON'T GIVE THAT PROTECTION TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES INTO THE DRUG COMPANIES BUT TO THE GUN MANUFACTURERS. OVER 150,000 PEOPLE A BEEN MURDERED IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT COUNTING SUICIDES SINCE 2005. SINCE WE PASSED THAT EXEMPTION. 6405 OF THEM RIGHT HERE IN OHIO. NOT ONE OF THEIR FAMILIES CONSUME. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU USE THE TERM, BUT IT IS IMMORAL. WE HAVE TO END IT. FOLKS, WE CAN'T STAND BY WHILE THIS CRISIS CONTINUES TO WORSEN. WE CAN'T JUST GIVE UP AND SAY THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE. THERE'S PLENTY TO BE DONE. AND NOW, MR. MAYER, AND THE CITY ATTORNEY ZACH KLEIN, THEY ARE FIGHTING LIKE HELL TO PASS SOME SENSIBLE GUN REFORM POLICY RIGHT HERE IN COLUMBUS. INCLUDING PASSING A CITY ORDINANCE THAT BANDS OF BUMP STOCKS. HERE IN OHIO, WE ARE GOING TO MAKING CHANGE, WE NEED THAT AT STATE LEVEL. THE TRAGEDY IN DAYTON, AFTER THE GOVERNOR AND DONALD TRUMP MADE OVERTURES ABOUT BACKGROUND CHECKS AND RED FLAG LAWS. LIKE MY SON GOT PASSED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE BEFORE HE DIED. THAT'S WITH THE MAYOR WANTS. THAT'S WHAT ADVOCATES THE FRONTLINE WENT. WHAT THEN HAPPENED? NRA MOVED INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. DONALD TRUMP DID NOT DO A DARN THING THAT HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO RELATIVE TO GUN SAFETY. ALL THE SUDDEN, GUNS ARE NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM ANYMORE. FOLKS, IT MATTERS WHO ELECT, IT MATTERS WHAT WE STAND FOR. SO LET'S START GETTING RID OF DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT WITH THE INITIATIVES OF THE NRA AND THE OVAL OFFICE ARE CONTINUING TO DICTATE. REPLACING THEM WITH SOMEONE WHO WILL GO AFTER THE NRA AND GUN MANUFACTURERS. THEY HAVE A FULL OFFICE AND IF I COULD MAKE ONE MORE INTERJECTION HERE. FOLKS, I MET WITH SOME OF THE LEADING TECH PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN PURCHASE , YOU CAN MAKE A WEAPON A GUN WHERE ONLY YOUR BIOMETRICS CAN PULL THE TRIGGER. YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN PULL THE TRIGGER. IF ANY OF YOU TODAY, LEFT YOUR KEY IN THE AUTOMOBILE OUT OF THE PARKING LOT, AND A 14-YEAR-OLD KID GETS IN THE CAR, STARTS IT UP AND GETS IN AN ACCIDENT, YOU ARE LIABLE. CIVILLY LIABLE. HOW DOES THAT VIOLATE ANYONE'S SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT IF YOU PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK, YOU CAN PURCHASE A GUN, BUT ONLY YOU CAN PULL THE TRIGGER. WILL GUESS WHAT? MONTHS AGO, I CAME UP WITH CERTAIN PISTOLS I COULD DO THAT. THE STORES ARE BEGINNING TO SELL THEM, ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY GOT NOTICE FROM THE GUN MANUFACTURERS. IF YOU CONTINUE TO SELL THEM WE ARE GOING TO OUT YOU. WE ARE NOT GOING TO SUPPORT YOU. WE ARE NOT GOING TO SELL TO YOU. GUESS WHAT, THEY TOOK THEM OFF THE MARKET. THIS IS ABOUT GUN SALES, SALES , MONEY, PROFIT. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. SO AS PRESIDENT, NOT ONLY IN MY GOING TO WORK ON THIS I'M GOING TO TRY TO RALLY THE TECH SECTOR TO MAKE SURE THEY RISE UP AND DO SOMETHING THAT CAN INFECT AFFECT AFFECT WHAT HAPPENS. BY THE WAY, SANDY HOOK WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED, WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE MOM LEFT ALL THOSE GUNS OUT. THE KID WHO COULD NOT PASS THE BACKGROUND CHECK, GOT THE GUNS WENT TO SCHOOL KILLED ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE HOLD THE HOUSE, THAT IS WE THE DEMOCRATS HOLD THE HOUSE AND FLIP THE SENATE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE ELECT DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT IN THAT SILLY PLACE WORKING TO FIND THE COURAGE TO GET THINGS DONE. NOT THAT EVERY DEMOCRAT IS VOTED THE RIGHT WAY. WE HAVE TO FIGHT THE NRA, SUPPORT A MAJORITY OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS THAT MAKE SENSE. FIGHT FOR OUR KIDS. FIGHT FOR A GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE TERRIFIED OF GOING TO SCHOOL. AGAIN, THE PRESS THAT FOLLOWS ME KNOWS I HAVE QUOTED FROM NATIONAL PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. KIDS ARE MOST FRIGHTENED, WHAT IS IT ON THE SCALE ONE TO FIVE WITH THEIR MOST FRIGHTENED ABOUT? GETTING SHOT IN SCHOOL. IT'S A MORAL DISGRACE. FIGHT TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF DANGEROUS PEOPLE. FIGHT FOR COMMITTEES LIKE THIS WHEN TO MAKE THEM SECURE. LOOK, I HAVE LOOKED IT TO ME DEVASTATED FAMILY MEMBERS, TOO MANY BRAVES SCHOOL SHOOTING SURVIVORS IN THE EYE AND I HAVE MADE THEM ALL A SIMPLE PROMISE AND I'VE MADE THIS PROMISE. I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER, I WILL NEVER GIVE UP THIS FIGHT. UNTIL WE STOP AT THE CARNAGE THAT IS OCCURRING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE NRA AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS. IF YOU STAND WITH ME, WE WILL PASS LAWS TO BAN KILLER ASSAULT WEAPONS. HOLD GUN MAKERS LIABLE. WE CAN DO THIS. AND THE REASON WE CAN IS BECAUSE OF THE MOMS STANDING BEHIND ME. THANK YOU.

AS THE RESULTS WERE COMING IN, THE VICE PRESIDENT SPOKE TO CAMPAIGN STAFF AFTER CANCELING THE CAMPAIGN , A CAMPAIGN EVENT IN CLEVELAND. BERNIE SANDERS ALSO CANCELED A RALLY IN OHIO FOR THE SAME REASON, BUT DECLINED TO MAKE PUBLIC REMARKS ON PRIMARY NIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, WE WERE NOT PLANNING A RALLY, BUT OUR HEADQUARTERS IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER, AND THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED LIKE THE DEVIL TO GET THANK YOU TO MY SISTER VALERIE, MY SON-IN-LAW, AND FOLKS, LOOK. WE WERE PLANNING A BIG RALLY IN CLEVELAND TONIGHT, BUT THE GOVERNOR OF OHIO ASKED THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS TO CANCEL THEIR INDOOR PUBLIC EVENTS IN CLEVELAND, WHERE THERE ARE LARGE CROWDS OF PEOPLE, AND THAT IS WHAT WE DID, DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS. HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AS I SAID ALL ALONG, THAT WE WOULD FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF THE CDC, STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS WITH RESPECT TO OUR CAMPAIGN EVENTS WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. , THIS WHOLE CORONAVIRUS IS A MATTER OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. LATER THIS WEEK, I WILL BE SPEAKING TO YOU ON WHAT I BELIEVE THE NATION SHOULD BE DOING TO ADDRESS THIS VIRUS. TONIGHT I WENT TO SPEAK TO YOU FROM PHILADELPHIA, WHERE WE ANNOUNCED OUR CAMPAIGN AT THE FRONT END, WHERE WE DID OUR ANNOUNCEMENT. TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED OUT, LEFT BEHIND, THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. JUST OVER ONE WEEK AGO, MANY OF THE PUNDITS DECLARED THAT THIS CANDIDACY WAS DEAD. NOW WE ARE VERY MUCH ALIVE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WITH VICTORIES IN MISSISSIPPI, MISSOURI, MICHIGAN AND WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM IDAHO, NORTH DAKOTA AND WASHINGTON STATE. AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING, THIS ELECTION IS ONE THAT HAS CHARACTER ON THE BALLOT. THAT CHARACTER OF THE CANDIDATES AND OF THE NATION IS ON THE BALLOT. IT IS MORE THAN A COMEBACK IN MY VIEW, OUR CAMPAIGN, IT IS A COMEBACK FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. THIS CAMPAIGN IS TAKING OFF, AND I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO DO WELL FROM THIS POINT ON. TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED. I WANT TO EARN EVERY SINGLE VOTE IN EVERY SINGLE STATE, BUT IF YOU ARE WILLING, IF YOU WANT TO JOIN US, GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SIGN UP, VOLUNTEER AND CONTRIBUTE IF YOU CAN. WE NEED YOU. WE WANT YOU. THERE IS A PLACE IN OUR CAMPAIGN FOR EACH OF YOU. I WANT TO THANK BERNIE SANDERS AND HIS SUPPORTERS FOR THEIR TIRELESS ENERGY AND THEIR PASSION. WE SHARE A COMMON GOAL AND TOGETHER, WE WILL DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. WE WILL DEFEAT HIM TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO BRING THIS NATION TOGETHER. WE ARE REGENERATING A DEMOCRATIC BASE, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATED FOLKS LIKE THE ONES I GREW UP WITH IN CLAREMONT NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE, IN MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD, SUBURBAN WOMEN, VETERANS, FIREFIGHTERS, SO MANY MORE. PEOPLE OF EVERY ECONOMIC STATION. THE POOR WHO ARE STRUGGLING , AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT , THE MIDDLE CLASS, WHO WONDER WHETHER THERE WILL BE ABLE TO HANG ON AND MAINTAIN THEIR ECONOMIC SECURITY, THEY ARE THE REASON JILL AND I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS CAMPAIGN IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY ARE THE REASON WHY I BECAME A DEMOCRAT SO LONG AGO. I CAN'T TELL YOU, I MEAN THIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART , I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THE CONFIDENCE THEY HAVE SHOWN IN ME THUS FAR. THE WAY THEY TURNED OUT TO VOTE FOR ME. MY FIRST CAMPAIGN WHEN I WAS A KID, LONG TIME AGO, I HAD A BILLBOARD THAT SAID ONE THING ON IT. I HAD A PICTURE OF MY WIFE AND CHILDREN, AND IT SAID, \"FOR OF OUR FAMILIES.\" THAT IS ALL IT WAS. \"FOR ALL OUR FAMILIES.\" IT INCLUDED DEMOCRATIC FAMILIES, FAMILIES OF INDEPENDENT VOTERS, REPUBLICAN FAMILIES, EVERYONE OF EVERY STRIPE. FOR ALL OF OUR FAMILIES. AND LOOK, THAT IS WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN SOUTH CAROLINA, THAT IS WHAT WE DID ON SUPER TUESDAY, AND IT APPEARS, ALTHOUGH A LITTLE PREMATURE, IT APPEARS THAT IS WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO TONIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN JUST THE PAST WEEK, SO MANY OF MY INCREDIBLE COMPETITORS HAVE ENDORSED ME. MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, AMY KLOBUCHAR, BETO O'ROURKE MICHAEL , BLOOMBERG, CORY BOOKER AND KAMALA HARRIS. TOGETHER WE ARE BRINGING THIS PARTY TOGETHER. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. TONIGHT WE ARE ONE STEP CLOSER TO RESTORING DECENCY, DIGNITY AND HONOR TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT IS OUR ULTIMATE GOAL. [APPLAUSE] AND AT THIS MOMENT, WITH SO MUCH FEAR IN THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE WORLD, WE NEED AMERICAN LEADERSHIP. WE NEED PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. THAT IS HONEST, TRUSTED, TRUTHFUL AND STEADY. REASSURING LEADERSHIP. IF I AM GIVEN THE HONOR OF BECOMING YOUR PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU I WILL STRIVE TO GIVE THE NATION THAT VERY LEADERSHIP EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY. THAT IS THE REASON WHY ARE YOU , THAT IS THE REASON WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I BELIEVE WE ARE IN AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY, A PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER A BOLD PROGRESSIVE VISION TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, GUARANTEEING THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS HEALTH CARE, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, TOTAL HEALTH CARE. NOT A PRIVILEGE, BUT A RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] BUILDING ON OBAMACARE, PROVIDING EVERY CHILD ACCESS TO GOOD EDUCATION REGARDLESS OF THEIR ZIP CODE. TO DEAL WITH THE MORAL DEPRAVITY OF OUR CHILDREN WHO HAVE TO LEARN AT SCHOOL, LITTLE CHILDREN, TO DUCK AND COVER, ZIGZAG DOWN THE HALLWAY BECAUSE THEY FEAR SOMEONE WITH AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON MAY BE COMING IN. WE HAVE TO STAND UP TO THE GUN MANUFACTURERS AND THE NRA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE HAVE TO ONCE AGAIN LEAD THE WORLD. DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA FIRST POLICIES MADE AMERICA ALONE. IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE, WE HAVE TO RALLY THE REST OF THE WORLD TO ACT AND ACT NOW. REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD ON DAY ONE, MAKE IT CLEAR TO OUR ALLIES THAT WE WILL HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS. THAT OUR WORD CAN BE TRUSTED. [APPLAUSE] TONIGHT, I AM SPEAKING IN FRONT OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION CENTER, NOT FAR FROM WHERE TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN ALL OF HISTORY WERE WRITTEN, THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. \"WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT.\" THOSE WORDS BECAME THE AMERICAN CREED KNOWN AROUND THE WORLD. THE U.S. CONSTITUTION. \"WE THE PEOPLE.\" THESE WORDS LITERALLY CHANGED THE WORLD. WE NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO THE PROMISE OF EITHER OF THOSE DOCUMENTS, BUT WE HAVE NEVER BEFORE WALKED AWAY FROM THEM. THEY ARE A REMINDER OF WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. OUR VERY DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. I SAID FROM THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCED NOT FAR FROM HERE THAT I BELIEVE WE ARE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. WHEN DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT, OUR CORE VALUES, OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD, OUR VERY DEMOCRACY, EVERYTHING THAT HAS MADE AMERICA AMERICA, IS TRULY AT STAKE. I BELIEVE THIS NATION CAN OVERCOME FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. BUT GIVEN EIGHT, FOUR MORE YEARS, COULD FOREVER AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. BUT WINNING MEANS UNITING AMERICA. NOT SOWING MORE DIVISION AND ANGER. IT MEANS HAVING A PRESIDENT THAT NOT ONLY KNOWS HOW TO FIGHT, BUT KNOWS HOW TO HEAL. [APPLAUSE] IT MEANS REPLACING A PRESIDENT WHO DEMEANS AND DEMONIZES HIS PEOPLE WITH A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES IN EMPATHY AND COMPASSION AND RESPECT FOR EVERYONE. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE DAYS OF DIVISIVENESS WILL SOON BE OVER. WE ARE A DECENT, BRAVE, RESILIENT PEOPLE. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS MOMENT WE ARE IN. WE HAVE TO DO, WE JUST NEED TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. WE ARE CLOSE TO THE EVE OF ST. PATRICK'S DAY, I HAVE THOUGHT OF A QUOTE , SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME QUOTE MANY TIMES, A FELLOW I ADMIRE VERY MUCH WHO PASSED AWAY NOT LONG AGO, A POET NAMED SEAMUS HEANEY. HE WROTE A POEM, AND HERE IS WHAT HE SAID IN ONE STANZA, HE SAID, \"HISTORY TEACHES US NOT TO HOPE ON THIS SIDE OF THE GRAVE, BUT THEN ONCE IN A LIFETIME, THAT LONG FORWARD TIDAL WAVE OF JUSTICE RISES UP AND HOPE AND HISTORY RHYMES.\" I TRULY BELIEVE IT IS IN OUR POWER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST THREE YEARS, THE POWER TO MAKE HOPE IN , HOPE AND HISTORY RHYME. THAT IS WHAT WE GOING TO DO. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. AND MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) (music) DURING THIS ELECTION SEASON, THE CANDIDATES BEYOND THE TALKING POET , POINTS ARE ONLY REVEALED OVER TIME. BUT SINCE YOU CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE, THERE IS C-SPAN. OUR CAMPAIGN 2020 PROGRAMMING DIFFERS FROM OTHER POLITICAL COVERAGE FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON , IT IS C-SPAN.

OUR TOP PRIORITY AS OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR COUNTRY IS TO FIGHT THIS DISEASE AND PREVENT ITS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT I THINK TOOK DECISIVE AND THE CORRECT ACTION THAT WAS NEEDED. THESE MEASURES ARE IN ADDITION TO THE WORK THAT THE PRESIDENT TOOK EARLIER. THE PRESIDENT STOPPING THE FLIGHT FROM CHINA HAS ACTUALLY SAVED LIVES. NOW IN CONGRESS, WE HAVE TAKEN SOME ACTION AS WELL. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, JUST LAST WEEK WE PASSED $8 BILLION SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN TO FOCUS ON THREE MAJOR THINGS. THE TESTING, THE TREATMENT, AND TELEHEALTH. WHICH WILL HELP US NOT ONLY IN RURAL AREAS BUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS WE TRY TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE. ALONG WITH THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGE, WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON MITIGATING THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS FROM THIS VIRUS AS WELL. THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT SAID WE ARE COMMITTED TO HELPING THOSE WHO WILL FACE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP AS A RESULT OF WORK DISRUPTIONS AND ILLNESS. THE COUNTRY IS LOOKING TO THE GOVERNMENT TO COME TOGETHER AND MEET THESE CHALLENGES. BUT THE BILL THAT WE SAW THAT JUST CAME FORTH LAST NIGHT AT 11:00 P.M. COMES UP SHORT. THERE'S A COUPLE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH IT. HERE'S ONE GLARING PROBLEM. UNDER PELOSI'S BILL, THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION WILL BE SET UP TO ADMINISTER THE PAID SICK LEAVE PROGRAM. THIS WILL TAKE MORE THAN SIX MONTHS SO IT WON'T WORK IN TIME. IT ALSO WILL HAMPER THE ADMINISTRATION FROM PUTTING OUT SOCIAL SECURITY FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT RIGHT NOW THAT ARE IN HARM'S WAY. THIS WILL HURT THE VERY POPULATION THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING. IT FORCES PERMANENT PAID SICK LEAVE FOR ALL BUSINESSES WITHOUT EXEMPTIONS AND NO SUNSETS. INSTEAD, WE'RE COMMITTING TO GET THIS RIGHT SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THE WHITE HOUSE, , [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY. VISIT NCICAP.ORG] [CAPTIONS COPYRIGHT NATIONAL CABLE SATELLITE CORP. 2020] GOOD AFTERNOON. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, TODAY ACROSS THE NATION MANY OF US ARE FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT THE SPREAD OF THE COVID-19 KNOWN AS THE CORONAVIRUS. AND THREAT IT POSES TO OUR HEALTH, OUR LOVED ONES, OUR FAMILIES, OUR LIVELIHOODS. YOU KNOW, I KNOW PEOPLE ARE WORRIED. MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH THOSE WHO ARE DIRECTLY FIGHTING THIS VIRUS. THOSE INFECTED, FAMILIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED A LOSS, FIRST RESPONDERS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE PUTTING THEMSELVES ON THE LINE AS I SPEAK FOR OTHERS. I'D LIKE TO THANK THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY MAKING SACRIFICES TO PROTECT US, WHETHER THAT'S SELF-QUARANTINE THEMSELVES OR CANCELING EVENTS AND CLOSING CAMPUSES. BECAUSE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE INFECTED OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS INFECTED OR HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH AN INFECTED PERSON, THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A NATIONAL RESPONSE. NOT JUST FROM OUR ELECTED LEADERS OR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS, BUT FROM ALL OF US. WE MUST, ALL OF US, FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES OF THE HEALTH OFFICIALS AND TAKE APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND, AND CRITICALLY TO PROTECT OTHERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE MOST AT RISK FROM THIS DISEASE. IT'S GOING TO MEAN MAKING RADICAL CHANGES IN OUR PERSONAL BEHAVIORS. MORE FREQUENT AND MORE THOROUGH HAND WASHING. STAYING HOME FROM WORK IF YOU'RE ILL. BUT ALSO ALL DURING THE DEEPLY ENGRAGED HABITS IN OUR COUNTRY LIKE HANDSHAKES AND HUGS. THAT'S WHY EARLIER THIS WEEK ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF OFFICIALS, MY CAMPAIGN CANCELED ELECTION NIGHT RALLIES THAT WE'D PLANNED TO HOLD IN CLEVELAND, OHIO. WE'RE ALSO REIMAGINING THE FORMAT FOR LARGE-CROWD EVENTS WE HAD PLANNED IN CHICAGO AND MIAMI IN THE COMING DAYS. AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS AND ADJUST HOW WE CONDUCT OUR CAMPAIGNS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND FINAL NEW WAYS TO SHARE OUR , FIND NEW WAYS TO SHARE OUR MESSAGE WITH THE PUBLIC WHILE PUTTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST, ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE. YESTERDAY WE ANNOUNCED A PUBLIC HEALTH ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS WHO WILL CONTINUE TO COUNSEL MY CAMPAIGN AND ME, HELP GUIDE OUR DECISIONS ON THE STEPS TO MINIMIZE FURTHER RISKS. WE WILL LEAD BY SCIENCE. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION NOW HAS OFFICIALLY DECLARED COVID-19 A PANAMA , PANDEMIC. DOWN PLAYING IT, BEING OVERLY DISMISSIVE OR SPREADING MISINFORMATION IS ONLY GOING TO HURT US AND FURTHER ADVANTAGE THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. BUT NEITHER SHOULD WE PANIC OR FALL BACK OGNJEN PHOBIA , XENOPHOBIA, LABELING COVID-19 A FOREIGN VIRUS DOES NOT DISPLACE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE MISJUDGMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN THUS FAR BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. LET ME BE CRYSTAL CLEAR. THE CORONAVIRUS DOES NOT HAVE A POLITICAL AFFILIATION, WILL AFFECT REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE AND WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON NATIONAL ORIGIN, RACE, GENDER OR ZIP CODE. IT WILL TOUCH PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF POWER, AS WELL AS THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR SOCIETY. IT WILL NOT STOP. BANNING ALL TRAVEL FROM EUROPE OR ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD MAY SLOW IT, BUT AS WE'VE SEEN, IT WILL NOT STOP IT. AND TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS BASED ON FAVORITISM AND POLITICS RATHER THAN RISK WILL BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. THIS DISEASE COULD IMPACT EVERY NATION AND ANY PERSON ON THE PLANET. WE NEED TO PLAN ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO AGGRESSIVELY MANAGE HERE AT HOME. YOU KNOW, WE ALL DO KNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MEET THIS MOMENT. WE'RE GOING TO FACE THIS WITH THE SAME SPIRIT THAT HAS GUIDED US THROUGH PREVIOUS CRISES. AND WE'LL COME TOGETHER AS A NATION, WE'LL LOOK OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER AND DO OUR PART AS CITIZENS. WE HAVE TO BE , WE HAVE TO HARNESS THE INGENUITY OF OUR SCIENTISTS AND THE RESOURCEFULNESS OF OUR PEOPLE. AND WE HAVE TO HELP THE WORLD, HELP THE WORLD TO DRIVE COORDINATED GLOBAL STRATEGY. NOT SHUT OURSELVES OFF FROM THE WORLD. PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB OF ANY PRESIDENT AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS VIRUS LAID BEAR THE SEVERE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. PUBLIC FEARS ARE BEING COMPOUNDED BY PERVASIVE LACK OF TRUST IN THIS PRESIDENT. FUELED BY ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE TRUTH THAT IT CONTINUES TO HAVE. OUR GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY HAS BEEN UNDERMINED BY HOLLOWING OUT OUR AGENCIES AND DISPARAGEMENT OF SCIENCE. AND OUR ABILITY TO DRIVE A GLOBAL RESPONSE IS DRAMATICALLY, DRAMATICALLY UNDERCUT BY THE DAMAGE TRUMP HAS DONE TO OUR CREDIBILITY AND OUR RELATIONSHIPS AROUND THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO GET TO WORK IMMEDIATELY TO DIG OURSELVES OUT OF THIS HOLE. AND THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M RELEASING A PLAN TO COMBAT AND OVERCOME THE CORONAVIRUS. A FULL DE, THE FULL DETAILS OF THE PLAN, IF YOU WANT TO SEE THEM GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM, WHERE I LAY OUT THE IMMEDIATE STEPS WE HAVE TO TAKE TO DELIVER ONE DECISIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO CURB THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE AND TO PROVIDE TREATMENT FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT AND A DECISIVE ECONOMIC RESPONSE THAT DELIVERS REAL RELIEF TO AMERICAN WORKERS, FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AND PROTECTS THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE. I OFFER IT AS A ROAD MAP, NOT FOR WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT 10 MONTH INTERESTS NOW, BUT FOR THE LEADERSHIP THAT I BELIEVE IS NEEDED, REQUIRED AT THIS VERY MOMENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WELCOME TO ADOPT ALL OF IT TODAY. THE CORE PRINCIPLE IS SIMPLE. PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS MUST BE THE ONES MAKING OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DECISIONS. AND COMMUNICATING WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. IT WOULD BE A STEP TOWARD RECLAIMING PUBLIC TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AS WELL. TOWARD STOPPING THE FEAR AND CHAOS THAT CAN OVERTAKE COMMUNITIES FASTER THAN THIS PANDEMIC CAN OVERTAKE THEM. IT'S CRITICAL TO MONITOR AN EFFECTIVE NATIONAL RESPONSE THAT WILL SAVE LIVES, PROTECT OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH WORKERS, SLOW THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS, FIRST. ANYONE, ANYONE WHO NEED TO BE TESTED SHOULD BE TESTED AT NO CHARGE. AT NO CHARGE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S FAILURE ON TESTING IS COLOSSAL. AND IT'S A FAILURE OF PLANNING, LEADERSHIP AND EXECUTION. THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD MEASURE AND REPORT EACH DAY, EACH AND EVERY DAY HOW MANY TESTS HAVE BEEN ORDERED, HOW MANY TESTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED, AND HOW MANY HAVE TESTED POSITIVE. BY NEXT WEEK THE NUMBER OF TESTS SHOULD BE IN THE MILLIONS, NOT THE THOUSANDS. WE SHOULD MAKE EVERY PERSON IN THE NURSING HOME AVAILABLE FOR TESTING. EVERY SENIOR CENTER OR VULNERABLE POPULATION HAS TO HAVE EASY ACCESS TO THE TEST AND WE SHOULD ESTABLISH HUNDREDS OF MOBILE TESTING SITES, AT LEAST 10 PER STATE, AND DRIVE-THROUGH TESTING CENTERS TO SPEED TESTING AND PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR WORKERS. THE C.D.C., PRIVATE LABS, UNIVERSITIES AND MANUFACTURERS SHOULD BE WORKING LOCK-STEP TO GET THIS DONE AND GET IT DONE CORRECTLY. NO EFFORT SHOULD BE SPARED. NONE. NO EXCUSES SHOULD BE MADE. TESTS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL WHO NEED THEM. AND THE GOVERNMENT, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STOP AT NOTHING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. WE MUST KNOW THE TRUEX TENT OF THIS OUTBREAK SO WE CAN , TRUE EXTENT OF THE OUTBREAK, SO WE CAN MAP IT, TRACE IT AND CONTAIN IT. NOR SHOULD WE HIDE THE TRUE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS IN HOPETS OF , HOPES OF PROTECTING POLITICAL INTERESTS OR THE STOCK MARKET. THE MARKETS WILL RESPOND STRONG, TO STRONG AND STEADY AND CAPABLE LEADERSHIP THAT ADDRESSES THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM, NOT EFFORTS TO COVER IT UP. SECONDLY, WE NEED TO SURGE OUR CAPACITY TO BOTH PREVENT AND TREAT THE CORONAVIRUS. AND PREPARE OUR HOSPITALS TO DEAL WITH THE INFLUX OF THOSE NEEDING CARE, AS I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR WEEKS. THIS MEANS NOT JUST GETTING OUT THE TESTING KITS AND PROCESSING THEM QUICKLY, BUT MAKING SURE COMMUNITIES HAVE THE HOSPITAL BEDS AVAILABLE, THE STAFF, THE MEDICAL SUPPLIES, THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT NECESSARY TO TREAT THE PATIENTS. THE PRESIDENT SHOULD ORDER FEMA TO PREPARE THE CAPACITY WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ESTABLISH TEMPORARY HOSPITALS WITH HUNDREDS OF BEDS AND SERVE NOTICE. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SHOULD BE PLANNING NOW, SHOULD HAVE EVENT PLANNING TO PREPARE FOR THE POTENTIAL DEPLOYMENT OF THE RESOURCES PROVIDED, MEDICAL FACILITY CAPACITY ON LOGISTIC SUPPORT THAT ONLY THEY CAN DO. A WEEK FROM NOW, A MONTH FROM NOW, WE CAN HAVE A 5, 500-BED HOSPITAL TO TREAT PATIENTS IN THIS COUNTRY. WE CAN DO THAT. BUT WE ARE NOT READY YESTERDAY AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING , YET AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING. AS WE TAKE THESE STEPS, STATE, FEDERAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES NEED TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ACCURATE, UP TO DATE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN. TO EVERYONE. SO EVERYONE CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT WHEN TO GET TESTED, WHEN TO SELF-QUARANTINE, WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL TREATMENT, AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROVIDE STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES WITH CLEAR GUIDANCE OF WHEN TO TRIGGER MORE AGGRESSIVE MITIGATION POLICIES SUCH AS CLOSING SCHOOLS. THIRD, WE NEED TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND TREATMENT OF A VACCINE. SCIENCE TAKES TIME. IT WILL STILL BE MANY MONTHS BEFORE WE HAVE A VACCINE THAT CAN BE PROVEN SAFE FOR PUBLIC USE AND PRODUCE SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BUT THERAPEUTICS CAN AND SHOULD COME SOONER. THIS WILL SAVE LIVES. WHEN I PUT TOGETHER AND WE PASSED THE CURES ACT OF 2016 TO ACCELERATE WORK ON THE NATIONAL , AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, BUT NOW IT HAS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE, MAKE AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO SPEED UP, SPEED THAT PROCESS ALONG. WE HAVE TO FAST TRACK CLINICAL TRIALS WITHIN N.I.H. WHILE CLOSELY COORDINATING WITH THE F.D.A., THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, ON TRIAL APPROVALS. SO THAT SCIENCE IS NOT HINDERED BY THE BUREAUCRACY. AND WHEN A VACCINE IS READY TO GO, IT SHOULD ALSO BE MADE WIDELY AVAILABLE AND, AGAIN, FREE OF CHARGE. WE SHOULD ALSO IMMEDIATELY RESTORE THE WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL DIRECTORATE FOR GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY AND BIODEFENSE. WITH A FULL-TIME DEDICATED COORDINATOR TO OVERSEE THAT RESPONSE. OUR ADMINISTRATION, OUR LAST ADMINISTRATION, WE CREATED THAT OFFICE TO BETTER RESPOND TO FUTURE GLOBAL THREATS AFTER THE EBOLA CRISIS OF 2014. IT WAS DESIGNED FOR EXACTLY THIS SCENARIO. FOR SOME REASON I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND, PRESIDENT TRUMP ELIMINATED THAT OFFICE TWO YEARS AGO. LOOK, HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. WE HAVE TO DO WHAT'S NECESSARY TO BEAT THE CHALLENGE, BEAT THIS CHALLENGE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. WE WILL BEAT IT. I ASSURE YOU, IF WE WAIT FOR IT TO WORSEN, THEN SCRAMBLE TO CATCH UP, THE HUMAN AND ECONOMIC TOLL WILL GROW FASTER, LARGER AND MORE DANGEROUS. CONGRESS GAVE THIS ADMINISTRATION $8 BILLION LAST WEEK TO FIGHT THE VIRUS. WE NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE USED FOR. HOW QUICKLY IT'S GOING OUT THE DOOR. AND EXACTLY HOW IT'S BEING SPENT. THIS BRINGS ME TO THE SECOND HALF OF THE CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC DISLOCATION. THE CORONAVIRUS IS GOING TO CAUSE IN OUR COUNTRY. WE MUST DO WHATEVER IT TAKES, SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES, TO DELIVER FOR OUR FAMILIES AND ENSURE THE STABILITY OF OUR ECONOMY. TAKING IMMEDIATE BOLD MEASURES TO HELP AMERICANS WHO ARE HURTING ECONOMICALLY RIGHT THIS MINUTE. IT MEANS WE'LL NEED BIGGER AND BROADER MEASURES TO SHORE UP THE ECONOMIC DEMAND, PROTECT JOBS, KEEP CREDIT FLOWING TO OUR JOB CREATORS, AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE ECONOMIC FIRE POWER WE NEED TO WEATHER THE STORM AND GET THE PEOPLE AND THIS ECONOMY BACK TO FULL STRENGTH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THIS CRISIS WILL HIT EVERYONE. BUT IT WILL HIT FOLKS WHO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK THE HARDEST. INCLUDING WORKING PEOPLE AND SENIORS AND OTHER , SENIORS. ANOTHER TAX CUT TO GOOGLE OR GOLDMAN AND MILLIONAIRES WON'T GET THE JOB DONE. ANOTHER TAX CUT TO THESE FOLKS WILL NOT GET THE JOB DONE. INDISCRIMINATE CORPORATE TAX SUBSIDIES WON'T EFFECTIVELY TARGET THOSE WHO REALLY NEED THE HELP NOW. WE NEED TO PLACE OUR FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING JUST TO GET BY. PEOPLE ARE ALREADY LOSING JOBS. WE NEED TO REPLACE THEIR WAGES. THAT INCLUDES WORKERS IN THE GIG ECONOMY WHO LACK UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. PARENTS WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH CHILD CARE COSTS. WE NEED TO GIVE THEM RELIEF. CHILDREN WHO RELY ON SCHOOL LUNCHES. WE NEED TO PROVIDE FOOD FOR THEM. SCHOOLS WILL NEED TO HELP ENSURING CHILDREN WHO DON'T HAVE EASY ACCESS TO COMPUTERS CAN STILL LEARN IF THEIR SCHOOL IS SHUT DOWN. PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY PAYING THEIR RENT OR MORTGAGE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN LAID OFF OR HAD THEIR HOURS CUT BACK NEED HELP TO STAY IN THEIR APARTMENTS AND HOMES. SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE DEVASTATED AS CUSTOMERS STAY HOME. AND EVENTS ARE CANCELED. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO INTEREST-FREE LOANS. NOT LOANS WITH INTEREST. INTEREST-FREE LOANS. IT'S A NATIONAL DISGRACE THAT MILLIONS OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS DON'T HAVE A SINGLE DAY OF PAID SICK LEAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM. WE NEED BOTH A PERMANENT PLAN FOR PAID SICK LEAVE AND AN EMERGENCY PLAN FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDS IT DUE TO THE OUTBREAK NOW. BEYOND THESE NATIONAL MEASURES, MY PLAN ALSO CALLS FOR THE CREATION OF A STATE, LOCAL EMERGENCY FUND TO MAKE SURE GOVERNORS, MAYORS AND LOCAL LEADERS WHO ARE BATTLING THE CORONAVIRUS ON THE GROUND AS I SPEAK HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MEET THIS CRISIS HEAD-ON NOW. THESE FUNDS CAN BE USED AT THE DISCRETION OF LOCAL LEADERS FOR WHATEVER THEY NEED MOST. FROM EXPANDING CRITICAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE, HIRING ADDITIONAL HEALTH CARE AND EMERGENCY SERVICE PERSONNEL, OR CUSHIONING THE WIDER ECONOMIC BLOWS THIS VIRUS IS GOING TO CREATE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE NEED SMART, BOLD, COMPASSIONATE LEADERSHIP THAT'S GOING TO HELP CONTAIN THE CRISIS, REDUCE THE HARDSHIPS TO OUR PEOPLE, AND HELP OUR ECONOMY REBOUND. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. UNFORTUNATELY THIS WILL JUST BE A START. WE MUST PREPARE NOW TO TAKE FURTHER DECISIVE ACTION, INCLUDING RELIEF THAT WILL BE LARGE IN SCALE, FOCUSED ON BROADER HEALTH AND STABILITY OF OUR ECONOMY. LOOK, WE CAN ONLY PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR ECONOMY IF WE DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR PEOPLE. THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THIS. WE'LL NEVER FULLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IF WE'RE UNWILLING TO LOOK BEYOND OUR OWN BORDERS AND ENGAGE FULLY WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. A DISEASE AT THAT STARTS ANYPLACE ON THE PLANET CAN GET ON A PLANE TO ANY CITY ON EARTH WITHIN A FEW HOURS. WE HAVE TO CONFRONT THE CORONAVIRUS EVERYWHERE. WE SHOULD BE LEADING A COORDINATED GLOBAL RESPONSE, JUST AS WE DID TO THE EBOLA CRISIS. THAT DRAWS ON THE INCREDIBLE CAPABILITY OF U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND OUR STATE DEPARTMENT TO ASSIST VULNERABLE NATIONS IN DETECTING AND TREATING THE CORONAVIRUS WHEREVER IT SPREADS. WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN REBUILDING AND STRENGTHENING THE GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY AGENDA, WHICH WE LAUNCHED DURING OUR ADMINISTRATION. SPECIFICALLY TO MOBILIZE THE WORLD AGAINST THE THREATS OF NEW INFECTIOUS DISEASES. LOOK, IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE THE CONCRETE VALUE OF THIS WORK WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE GOING WELL IN THE WORLD. BUT BY CUTTING OUR INVESTMENT IN GLOBAL HEALTH, THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS LEFT US WOEFULLY UNPREPARED FOR THE EXACT CRISIS WE NOW FACE. NO PRESIDENT CAN PROMISE TO PREVENT FUTURE OUTBREAKS. BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, WE WILL BE BETTER PREPARED, RESPOND BETTER AND RECOVER BETTER. WE'LL LEAD WITH SCIENCE. WE'LL LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS. WE'LL HEED THEIR ADVICE AND WE'LL BUILD AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AND REBUILD IT TO RALLY THE WORLD TO MEET A GLOBAL , THE GLOBAL THREATS THAT WE'RE LIKELY TO FACE AGAIN. YOU KNOW, AND I'LL ALWAYS TELL YOU THE TRUTH, THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A PRESIDENT. THAT'S WHAT IS OWED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOW, IN THE DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD, I KNOW THAT THIS COUNTRY WILL SUMMON THE SPIRIT, THE EMPATHY, THE DECENCY AND THE UNITY NEEDED BECAUSE IN TIMES OF CRISIS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALWAYS, ALWAYS STAND AS ONE IF TOLD THE TRUTH. VOLUNTEERS RAISE THEIR HANDS TO HELP. NEIGHBORS LOOK OUT FOR NEIGHBORS. BUSINESSES TAKE CARE OF THEIR WORKERS. SO WE'LL MEET THIS CHALLENGE TOGETHER. I'M CONFIDENT OF IT. BUT WE HAVE TO MOVE AND MOVE NOW. THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE AND GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU.

DOCTORS, NURSES, EMTS, PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS, AS WELL AS FRONT-LINE EMERGENCY WORKERS LIKE FIREFIGHTERS AND DEDICATED FOLKS WORKING TO KEEP SHELVES STOCKED IN THE GROCERY STORES. TACKLING THIS PANDEMIC IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY, LOOK INTO FIGHTING A WAR. IT WILL REQUIRE LEADERSHIP AND COOPERATION FROM EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. IT WILL REQUIRE US TO MOVE THOUGHTFULLY AND DECISIVELY TO QUICKLY ADDRESS BOTH THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND ECONOMIC CRISIS. IT WILL REQUIRE US TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC HEALTH EXPERTS. IT WILL REQUIRE EACH OF US TO DO OUR PART. YES, THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE WE NEED OUR LEADERS TO LEAD, BUT ALSO A MOMENT WHERE THE CHOICES AND DECISIONS WE MAKE AS INDIVIDUALS WILL COLLECTIVELY IMPACT WHAT HAPPENS. MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE SEVERITY OF THIS OUTBREAK AND PREPARING OUR MEDICAL SYSTEMS TO HANDLE IT. I KNOW WE AS A PEOPLE ARE UP TO THIS CHALLENGE, WE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. WE WILL ANSWER THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS WITH THE BEST WE FIND IN ALL OF US. THAT'S WHAT AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE AND WHAT WE DO. THAT'S WHO WE ARE. ORDINARY PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WHEN THE NEED ARISES. TODAY, WE ARE MOVING QUICKLY TO ATTRACT OUR ROUTINES TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE. AMERICANS IN THREE STRAIGHT , STATES WENT TO THE POLLS. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND POLL WORKERS WHO WORKED WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES TO SHARE SAFE OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOTING. MAKING SURE THE VOTERS CAN CAST THEIR BALLOTS WHILE MAINTAINING A DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER THAT WAS SAFE. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET THROUGH THIS CRISIS, PROTECTING BOTH PUBLIC HEALTH AND DEMOCRACY. TODAY, IT LOOKS LIKE ONCE AGAIN IN FLORIDA AND ILLINOIS, WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM ARIZONA, OUR CAMPAIGN HAS A GOOD NIGHT. WE MOVE CLOSER TO SECURING THE NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT. WE ARE DOING IT BY DOING A BROAD COALITION. WE NEED TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. WITH STRONG SUPPORT TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, LATINO COMMUNITY, HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATED FOLKS I GREW UP WITH IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD. TEACHERS, SUBURBAN WOMEN, VETERANS, FIREFIGHTERS, AND SO MANY MORE. WE ARE DOING IT WITH A COMMON VISION. SENATOR SANDERS AND I MAY DISAGREE ON TACTICS, BUT WE SHARE A COMMON VISION. FOR THE NEED TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS, REDUCING COMMON EQUITY THAT HAS RISEN SO DRASTICALLY, TO TACKLING THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF OUR TIME, CLIMATE CHANGE. SENATOR SANDERS AND HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE BROUGHT A REMARKABLE TENACITY TO ALL OF THESE ISSUES. TOGETHER, THEY SHIFTED THE FUNDAMENTAL CONVERSATION IN THIS COUNTRY. LET ME SAY ESPECIALLY TO THE YOUNG VOTERS INSPIRED BY SENATOR SANDERS, I HEAR YOU. I KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE, I KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. OUR GOAL IS TO CAMPAIGN, AND MY GOAL IS TO UNIFY THIS PARTY AND UNIFY THE NATION. IT'S A MOMENT LIKE THESE WERE WE REALIZE WE NEED TO PUT POLITICS INSIDE , ASIDE. THE CORONAVIRUS DOESN'T CARE IF YOU'RE DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. IT WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON NATIONAL ORIGIN, RACE, GENDER, OR YOUR ZIP CODE. IT WILL TOUCH PEOPLE OF POSITIONS OF POWER. THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY. WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER. THIS IS FOR EACH OF US TO SEE AND BELIEVE THE BEST AND EVERY ONE OF US. TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR NEIGHBOR. UNDERSTAND THE FEAR AND STRESS SO MANY ARE FEELING TO CARE FOR THE ELDERLY. THE ELDERLY COUPLE DOWN THE STREET, TO THINK THE HEALTH CARE WORKER, DOCTORS, NURSES, PHARMACISTS. THE GROCERY STORE CASHIER AND PEOPLE RESTOCKING THE SHELVES. TO BELIEVE IN ONE ANOTHER. BECAUSE I ASSURE YOU, WHEN WE SEE THE BEST IN EACH OF US, WE LIFT THIS NATION UP, WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. THAT'S HOW WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT. GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND MY SPECIAL PRAYER FOR THOSE OF YOU ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE CRISIS. DOCTORS, NURSES, HEALTH-CARE WORKERS, CARING FOR THE VIRUS VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILY. MY PRAYERS ARE GOING OUT FOR EVERYONE. MY HOPES ARE HIGH, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN TIMES OF CRISIS, AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS STEPPED UP. WE HAVE TO STEP UP AND CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER.

THE PRESIDENT OF THAT UNION AND HERE IN OUR STUDIOS AND NATHAN BOMEY OF USA TODAY TO BOTH OF YOU THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON NEWSMAKERS, BE SAFE. TEAMSTERS PRESIDENT RICHARD TRUMKA ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE 2020 CAMPAIGN AND THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER AND HOW THE PANDEMIC COULD AFFECT THAT. UP NEXT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN, A 2020 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE TALKS ABOUT THE NATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. THIS HAPPENED JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. IT'S ABOUT 15 MINUTES. GOOD MORNING. I HOPE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE DOING WELL IN THESE DIFFICULT AND ANXIOUS TIMES, CONFUSING TIMES. LIKE ALL FAMILIES, THE BIDEN FAMILY IS ADJUSTING TO NEW WAYS. LESS TIME TOGETHER, MORE WORRYING ABOUT FRIENDS AND RELATIVES, CONCERNS ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE ISOLATED OR SUFFERING DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS. AS AMERICANS, WE MAY BE PHYSICALLY APART, BUT WE'RE TRULY ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND YOU KNOW IT. LET ME SAY SOMETHING RIGHT UP FRONT. WHEN WE'VE STOOD AS ONE, THIS NATION HAS NEVER, EVER BEEN DEFEATED WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE DEFEATED NOW. THE PANDEMIC OF 1918, THE GREAT DEPRESSION, TWO WORLD WARS, WE OVERCAME THEM ALL AND OUT OF EACH CRISIS WE EMERGED STRONGER AND WE WILL AGAIN. THIS NEW ENEMY MAY BE UNSEEN, BUT WE HAVE THE TOOLS, THE EXPERTISE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE SPIRIT TO DEFEAT IT. BUT WE NEED TO MOVE AND WE NEED TO MOVE FAST. YOU KNOW, IT MATTERS HOW FAST WE MOVE FOR BOTH. LATER TODAY, YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT IN HIS DAILY BRIEFING. THESE BRIEFINGS ARE AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO INFORM AND REASSURE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. THEY'RE NOT A PLACE FOR POLITICAL ATTACKS OR TO LASH OUT AT THE PRESS. THEY'RE ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SO I HOPE TODAY AND IN THE DAYS AHEAD THE PRESIDENT WILL GIVE US THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH. THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED AND WHAT THEY DESERVE. I HOPE HE LETS THE MEDICAL EXPERTS AND FEMA LEADERS AND OTHERS CARRYING OUT THE WORK TO TAKE CENTER STAGE, TO HEAR FROM THEM DIRECTLY AND I HOPE WE HEAR LESS TALK AND SEE MORE EVIDENCE OF FAST ACTION. MY PRINCIPAL FOCUS TODAY AND EVERY DAY WILL BE ON WHAT WE SHOULD DO TO GET THIS RESPONSE FIXED TO SAVE LIVES, PROVIDE ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO NEED IT AND NEED IT NOW AND ARE GOING TO NEED IT IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD. IT STARTS WITH ADOPTING A MINDSET OF REAL URGENCY. FOR TOO LONG, THE WARNING SIGNS WERE IGNORED. FOR TOO LONG, THE ADMINISTRATION SAID THE THREATS WERE QUOTE \"UNDER CONTROL,\" CONTAINED, LIKE THE FLU. THE PRESIDENT SAYS NO ONE SAW THIS COMING. WELL, THAT'S JUST NOT ACCURATE. OUR INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS WERE WARNING OF CORONAVIRUS THREAT IN JANUARY. JUST BASED ON PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT I HAD, I WARNED THE THREAT WAS GETTING WORSE WAY BACK ON JANUARY THE 27th AND URGED THE NEED TO PUT SCIENCE FIRST, DRAW ON EMERGENCY FUNDS TO GET THE RESPONSE STARTED, THINK ABOUT INVOKING DISASTER POWERS IT TO RESPOND. MANY OF US TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO GET THE U.S. SCIENTISTS ON THE GROUND TO SEE FIRST-HAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN CHINA RATHER THAN ON RELYING WHAT CAME FROM CHINA. MY POINT IS NOT SIMPLY THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS WRONG. MY POINT IS THAT THE MINDSET THAT WAS SLOW TO RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE, TO TREAT IT WITH THE SERIOUSNESS IT DESERVED IS STILL TOO MUCH A PART OF HOW THE PRESIDENT IS ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM. SOUTH KOREA DETECTED THEIR FIRST CASE OF CORONAVIRUS IN THE SAME DAY WE DID. PUT THEY HAD TESTS AND SOPHISTICATED TRACING PROGRAMS TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY ON LOCKDOWN. WE HAD NONE OF THAT. SO WE'RE LEFT WITH ONLY ONE, THE EXTREME SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES CURRENTLY IN PLACE. THAT'S A FAILURE OF PLANNING AND PREPARATION BY THE WHITE HOUSE. TODAY, MONTHS LATER, AMERICANS STILL NEED TO BE TESTED AND STILL HAVE NO ACCESS TO TESTS IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TEETERS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE. HOSPITAL BEDS ARE FILLING. DOCTORS AND NURSES ARE ALREADY RUNNING OUT OF CRITICAL EQUIPMENT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO COORDINATE GETTING MEDICAL SUPPLIES OUT TO EVERY CORNER OF THE COUNTRY SO WE DON'T HAVE GOVERNORS COMPETING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. AS OF LATE YESTERDAY, WE WERE TOLD THAT THE PRESIDENT STILL HAS NOT ACTIVATED THE AUTHORITY UNDER THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT WHICH I AND OTHERS CALL HIM TO DIRECT AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES. TRUMP KEEPS SAYING THAT HE'S A WARTIME PRESIDENT. WELL, START TO ACT LIKE ONE. TO PARAPHRASE THE FRUSTRATED PRESIDENT LINCOLN WRITING TO AN INACTIVE GENERAL McLEGALEN DURING THE CIVIL WAR, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE ARMY, MAY I BORROW IT? END OF QUOTE. WE NEED TO GET IN MOTION IT TODAY WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE SET IN MOTION WEEKS AGO. ANY PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT WILL TELL YOU THAT IN A CRISIS LIKE THIS, YOU CAN'T MOVE TOO FAST, YOU CAN ONLY MOVE TOO SLOWLY. LET ME BE CLEAR. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT TO BLAME FOR THE CORONAVIRUS. BUT HE DOES BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR RESPONSE. AND I ALONG WITH EVERY AMERICAN HOPE HE STEPS UP AND STARTS TO GET THIS RIGHT. NOW, THIS ISN'T ABOUT POLITICS. THIS IS SIMPLY TOO MUCH AT STAKE, TOO MANY LIVES, TOO MANY LIVELIHOODHOODS, TOO MANY HOMES AND FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES AT RISK. I HAVE LAID OUT A VERY DETAILED IN-DEPTH PLAN FOR WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING. YOU CAN READ ON WWW.JOEBIDEN.COM. WE NEED IMMEDIATE ACTION ON TESTING, ON RESEARCH FOR TREATMENTS AND VACCINES, ON LEADING A GLOBAL RESPONSE TO BEAT THE VIRUS EVERYWHERE. BUT TODAY, I WANT TO FOCUS ON JUST FOUR KEY POINTS OF ACTION. FIRST, THE PRESIDENT JUST TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO INCREASE OUR CAPACITY, THE CAPACITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO TREAT THE SICKEST CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS SAFELY. I'M GLAD THE PRESIDENT HAS FINALLY ACTIVATED THE NATIONAL GUARD. NOW, WE NEED THE ARMED FORCES AND THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP WITH HOSPITAL CAPACITY, SUPPLIES AND LOGISTICS. WE NEED TO ACTIVATE THE RESERVE CORPS OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND NURSES AND BEEF UP THE NUMBER OF RESPONDERS DEALING WITH THE CRUSH OF CASES. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE IN A POSITION THAT WE'RE , WELL, LET ME GO THE SECOND THING. THE PRESIDENT MUST USE THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO RADICALLY INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF CRITICAL GOODS NEEDED TO TREAT PATIENTS AND PROTECT OUR HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS, INCLUDING THE PROTECTIVE GEAR LIKE FACE MASKS AND CRITICAL EQUIPMENT LIKE VENTILATORS SO DESPERATELY NEEDED IN OUR HOSPITALS. IT MEANS WORKING WITH ALL OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS TO GET SUPPLIES FROM OVERSEAS WHEN AVAILABLE, DISPATCHING U.S. MILITARY ASSETS TO RETRIEVE THEM QUICKLY IF THEY ARE AVAILABLE. IT MEANS FEDERAL COORDINATION OF THE SUPPLY CHAINS TO ACCELERATE DELIVERIES AND GET THEM TO THE RIGHT PLACES AT THE RIGHT TIME AND MITCH MORE. AND WE NEED TO BUILD AN ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY AS WE DID IN 1940. WE CAN TAKE , WE CAN , PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT , LOOK, HERE'S THE DEAL, WE HAVE TO DO WHAT WE DID IN THE '40s AND THE 20s IN THE 2020s AND WE CAN DO THAT. WE NEED TO BUILD A MEDICAL ARSENAL HERE. THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO BE IN THE , THE INFIGHTING AND BICKERING WITH HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION, LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS THAT PROVIDE CLEAR GUIDANCE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING CLEAR LEADERSHIP, CLEAR ACTION AND CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY. MANAGEMENT MATTERS IN A CRISIS. I'VE BEEN THERE IN THE SITUATION ROOM. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN ALL AT ONCE. YOU NEED TO BE PLANNING, NOT JUST FOR TODAY, BUT FOR TOMORROW AND THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. IS THE WHITE HOUSE ACTUALLY PLANNING FOR WHAT IT WILL TAKE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BEGIN TO RETURN TO SOMETHING RESEMBLING A NORMAL LIFE? I DON'T KNOW. JUST WAITING TO SEE ISN'T GOING TO CUT IT. WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED, BUILDINGS THAT SHOULD BE IN PLACE? WHAT PROTECTIONS AND PROTOCOLS DO WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IT DOESN'T SIMPLY START SPREADING AGAIN IN THE FALL? THEY NEED TO START PLANNING NOW SO THE CURRENT MEASURES STAY IN PLACE FOR AS LONG AS THEY ARE NEEDED, BUT NOT LONGER. AND FOURTH, THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO SET THE RIGHT PRIORITIES FOR OUR ECONOMIC RESPONSE. OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE MUST BE TO KEEP EVERYONE PAID THROUGH THIS CRISIS, EVERYONE. IT SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO KEEP WORKERS ON PAYROLLS. MAKE SMALL BUSINESSES HEALTHIER. HELP THE ECONOMY COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE STRONG. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN WHILE STILL PROTECTING THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS. WE CAN DO BOTH. UNFORTUNATELY, AS OF LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MITCH McCONNELL WERE OFFERING A PLAN TO LET BIG CORPORATIONS OFF THE HOOK. THEY PROPOSED A $500 BILLION SLUSH FUND FOR CORPORATIONS WITH ALMOST NO CONDITIONS. UNDER THEIR PLAN, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION COULD EVEN ALLOW COMPANIES TO USE THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE BEING GIVEN TO THEM BY TAXPAYERS MONEY TO BUY BACK STOCKS, INCREASE EXECUTIVE PAY, IF THAT'S WHAT THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY DECIDED. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE COMMITMENTS TO KEEP WORKERS EMPLOYED, THESE BIG CORPORATIONS. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO TELL THE AMERICANS WHERE THE MONEY GOES FOR MONTHS. TODAY, THERE'S AN ACTIVE EFFORT TO FIX THAT BILL IN THE CONGRESS GOING ON NOW AS WE SPEAK SO FOR WORKERS AND FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THEM, NO STRINGS CORPORATE BAILOUTS MAKES NO SENSE. HERE'S MY BOTTOM LINE. MILLIONS OF SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE THE FAMILY-RUN RESTAURANT THAT'S TRYING TO STAY OPEN TO PAY ITS WORKERS, THEY SHOULD GET THE FUNDS THEY NEED. BIG COMPANIES WILL NEED HELP, TOO, BUT NO BLANK CHECKS. IF CORPORATIONS TAKE MONEY FROM TAXPAYERS, THEY HAVE TO MAKE AN ENFORCEABLE COMMITMENT THAT THEY WILL KEEP WORKERS ON THE PAYROLL. WORKERS, THE WORKER WHO IS SEEING THEIR WAGES SLASHED, THEY NEED TO BE MADE WHOLE, THOSE WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS, THEY NEED STRONG, SUSTAINED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, WHETHER THEY ARE GIG WORKERS OR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES. THE FAMILY THAT WILL GO HUNGRY AND NEEDS FOOD ON THE TABLE, THEY NEED TO HELP NOW. SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS NEED TO BE BOOSTED NOW. STUDENT DEBT SHOULD BE FORGIVEN FOR NOW. CASH , LOOK, CASH RELIEF NEEDS TO GO OUT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. AND WE CAN ACT QUICKLY AND WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER. WE CAN PUT POLITICS ASIDE AND MEET THE MOMENT LIKE GOVERNORS ALL ACROSS THIS NATION ARE DOING. GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE, CHARLIE PARKER, GAVEN NEWSOM, WASHINGTON, MICHIGAN, NEW YORK GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO'S BRIEFINGS ARE A LESSON IN LEADERSHIP. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALL ARE RISING TO THE MOMENT, PUTTING ASIDE POLITICS TO DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE. BUT THEY'RE LOOKING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTING FOR MORE HELP. FINALLY. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT TODAY IS THE 10th ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I'M PROUD OF THE ROLE I PLAYED ALONGSIDE PRESIDENT OBAMA BACKING HIM UP TO BRING OBAMACARE INTO THE LAW. MAKING THE LAW. IT'S NOW LAW. AND I'M PROUD OF THE RECORD THAT'S ACHIEVED, BUT ALSO TODAY IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THE LARGEST PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES IN GENERATIONS, THE WHITE HOUSE AND REPUBLICAN ATTORNEYS GENERAL ARE ACTIVELY PURSUING A LAWSUIT TO INVALIDATE THE ACA IN COURT. THEY'RE WORKING TO STRIP MILLIONS OF AMERICANS OF THEIR HEALTHCARE AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF THEIR PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. I SENT A LETTER THIS MORNING WITH A SIMPLE REQUEST, WITHDRAW THE LAWSUIT, PLEASE. END THIS EFFORT TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S HEALTHCARE. THIS IS NOT THE MOMENT TO ADD ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR IN THIS NATION OR TO LET POLITICS TRUMP DOING WHAT'S RIGHT. GIVE AMERICANS PEACE OF MIND, THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR, HELP. YOU KNOW, IN CRISIS, CHARACTER IS REVEALED. AND EACH DAY WE'RE SEEING THE COURAGE AND THE HEART OF AMERICANS SHINE THROUGH. OUR MILITARY, OUR FIRST RESPONDERS, OUR DOCTORS, NURSES, HEALTHCARE WORKERS, OF COURSE THEY'RE DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB, BUT ALSO, THOSE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT MUCH. THE GROCERY STORE WORKER, STOCKING THE SHELF, THE MAIL PACKAGE CARRIERS, THE WORKERS MANUFACTURING GEAR WE NEED TO KEEP DELIVERY TRUCKS ON THE ROAD, COOKING MEALS TO DELIVER, TENDERING TO OUR ELDERLY LOVED ONES. THE JOURNALISTS WHO KEEP US UP TO DATE AND HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE AS LEADERS. THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WORKING ON THIS PROBLEM AND SO MANY MORE. THEY'RE PUTTING ALL OF IT ON THE LINE FOR ALL OF US. AND WE NEED TO GIVE THEM ALL THE HELP THEY NEED, AND NOW, THEY NEED HELP NOW. WE NEED TO BE SURE WE NEVER FORGET WHAT THEY'VE DONE. BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING A GREAT DEAL. LET ME CLOSE WITH A THOUGHT. TEAM IN THE HEART OF EVERY AMERICAN I THINK THERE BURNS A FLAME. IT'S AN INHOURITANCE FROM EVERY GENERATION OF AMERICANS THAT'S COME BEFORE US. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE OVERCOME EVERY CRISIS WE'VE FACED BEFORE. IT'S WHAT MAKES THIS , IF OUR LEADERSHIP DOES ITS PART, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL DO MORE THAN THEIR PART BECAUSE HERE'S THE SIMPLE TRUTH. ORDINARY HARD-WORKING AMERICANS HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN. SO WE NEED TO GET MOVING. MOVE FASTER. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND THOSE WHO ARE FIGHTING THE VIRUS. MAY GOD PROTECT YOU AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?470609-1\/joe-biden-remarks-coronavirus-response","Summary":"Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, delivered remarks on the national response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic from his home in Wilmington, Delaware.

EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE ORGANIZATION GAVE ITS ENDORSEMENT TO THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT. HIS REMARKS ARE JUST OVER 10 MINUTES. I WISH WE COULD BE TOGETHER IN PERSON, BUT I'M GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH YOU VIRTUALLY. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK , PROBABLY THE MUTE BUTTON IS NOT WORKING AT HIS INTRODUCTION. THE INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP OF YOU AND YOUR FELLOWW BOARD MEMBERS FOR CREATING AND BUILDING THIS VITAL ORGANIZATION. THANKS AS WELL TO THE EXTRAORDINARY LEADERS, SENATOR HARRIS, DUCKWORTH, REPRESENTATIVE TO, ALL FOR BEING HERE. WE GOT A CHANCE TO TALK EARLIER. FOR ALL THE WORK YOU ARE DOING TO HELP FOLKS WHO NEED IT, IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU AND IT IS A SPECIAL HONOR TO BE CONDUCT , TO BE TOGETHER DURING AA PI. I AM ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE VICTORY FUND IT I WAS HONORED TO RECEIVE YOUR ENDORSEMENT IN JANUARY. THIS MADE A DIFFERENCE, WHICH NOW FEELS LIKE A LIFETIME AGO. THAT ABOUT OF COMPETENCE MEANT THE WORLD TO ME IN A CRITICAL MOMENT AND STILL DOES. AS I TOLD NUMBERS OF CONGRESS AN HOUR AGO, I WAS POLITICALLY RAISED IN THIS ARENA BY DANIEL INOUYE. HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON WHO ENCOURAGED ME TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I LEARNED AN AWFUL LOT FROM HIM. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR STANDING WITH ME LIKE DANNY DID. I HOPE YOUR FAMILIES ARE STAYING SAFE AND HEALTHY. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE ANXIOUS MOMENT FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES, OUR NATION AND THE WORLD. MY PRAYERS ARE WITH ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE SCARED, WHO ARE SICK, WHO O ARE GRIEVING AND JUST STRUGGLING TO GET BY. AS WE SPEAK TODAY, MORE THAN 90,000 AMERICANS HAVE NOW LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS PANDEMIC. SKILL , (music) I DO NOT KNOW WHO'S PHONE THAT IS. THE SCALE OF THE LOSS IS STAGGERING. MORE THAN THAT, IT IS HEARTBREAKING SH. HOW MUCH FEAR, LOSS AND AGONY COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE PRESIDENT HAD NOT WASTED SO MUCH TIME IN TAKING RESPONSIBILITY. WE COULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING TEST. WE COULD HAVE MARSHALED SUPPLIES IN THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT, WHICH I CALLED FOR A LONG TIME AGO TO ENSURE EVERYONE COMMUNITY WAS READY. WE COULD HAVE BEEN EMBRACING THE PUBLIC TO ACT QUICKLY TO SLOW THE SPREAD. INSTEAD, WE GOT DENIAL, DELAYS, DISTRACTION. MANY OF WHICH WERE XENOPHOBIC. WE GOT PULLED FACED LIES ABOUT TESTING CAPACITY. THAT QUOTE, ANYBODY WHO A TEST CAN GET IT. IT WAS NOT REMOTELY TRUE TWO MONTHS AGO AND IS STILL NOT. WE GOT PROMISES. ONE DAY, , GOD ALMIGHTY. HE HAD MONTHS AND MONTHS TO TAKE ACTION. TO LEAD TO HE DID NOTHING BUT MAKE FALSE PROMISES AND DISMISS THE EXPERTS. NOW, 90,000 AMERICANS ARE GONE. LEAVING THE HIND , LEAVING BEHIND PROBABLY OVER 200,000, 300,000, 40,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST PART OF THEIR SOUL. MORE THAN 36 MILLION HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. MILLIONS MORE ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR BILLS. THIS PRESIDENT CANNOT SUMMON BARELY A WORD OF EMPATHY, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, EXPRESS REGRET. THERE IS NO INDICATION HE UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF THE PAIN AND THE LOSS THIS CRISIS HAS BROUGHT. IT IS NOT JUST LACK OF WORDS. IT IS LACK OF ACTION. CONGRESS GAVE THE ADMINISTRATION INTENSIFIED HIS OF DOLLARS FOR HELPING MAIN STREET IT WAS CALLED THE MAIN STREET LETTING PROGRAM TO HELP SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE NGRESS GAVE THAT MONEY CAN , THAT MONEY. THEY HAVE NOT LET A SINGLE DOLLAR YET. WHY DID THEY FAIL TO GET THIS MONEY OUT TO THE FOLKS WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT TO STAY AFLOAT? IS IT INCOMPETENCE? TRUMP IS TWEETING AGAIN THIS MORNING. REOPEN THE COUNTRY, END OF QUOTE. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT IF YOU ARE SITTING ON THE MONEY SMALL BUSINESSES NEED IN ORDER TO STAY ALIVE? STOP TWEETING ABOUT IT GET THE MONEY OUT TO MAIN STREET NOW. IT HAS BEEN PASSED. THIS PANDEMIC IS HITTING EVERYONE HARD. WE NEED SERIOUS COMPETENT LEADERSHIP NOW MORE THAN EVER. FRANKLY, WE NEED MORAL LEADERSHIP AS WELL. EVEN THOUGH THIS PANDEMIC HAS TOUCHED EVERY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD, AAPI COMMUNITY HAS HAD TO FIGHT ON AN ADDITIONAL FRONT. THE PANDEMIC HAS THE LEAST FAMILIAR FORCES OF HATE, FEAR AND XENOPHOBIA. WITH THIS PRESIDENT, IT BROUGHT , IT HAD BROUGHT WITH IT A NEW RASH OF RACIST MESSAGES, VERBAL, PHYSICAL ATTACKS AND OTHER ACTS OF HATE. SOME SUBTLE, SOME OVER, DIRECTLY AGAINST THE ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS SHOULD IT IS ONE OF , PACIFIC ISLANDERS. WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOLE OF THIS NATION. THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE WHAT HE IS DOING. IT STRIKES AT THE HEART OF OUR COUNTRY. WHO WE ARE, WHO WE WANT TO BE. THAT HATE IS ESPECIALLY DESPICABLE AT A TIME WHEN SO MANY ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE LEADING ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS FIGHT. LOOK AT THE THOUSANDS OF ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER NURSES, DOCTORS, RESEARCHERS, SCIENTISTS. DELIVERY DRIVERS, RETAIL WORKERS , RUNNING CRITICAL BUSINESSES, KEEPING US FED. THAT SERVICE IS NOT JUST ESSENTIAL. IT IS THE BEST OF AMERICA. IT IS THE BEST OF OUR STRENGTH, OUR COMPASSION, OUR SPIRIT. IT IS ALL BORN OF OUR UNIQUE DIVERSITIES AND PEOPLE. THE COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS. THE AAPI DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO NEVER MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO FAN THE FLAMES OF HATETE. YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO ATTACKS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE FOR VISITING A LOCAL CHINATOWN BUSINESS IN SAN FRANCISCO. YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO AGGRESSIVELY AND CHILDISHLY INSULTS ASIAN AMERICAN REPORTERS. THINK OF THAT. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE. INSULTS AND ASIAN AMERICAN REPORTER FOR DOING HER JOB AND ASKING A DIRECT QUESTION. YOU DESERVE A PARTNER AND A FRIEND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU DESERVE A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE HALLS. I WAS PROUD TO SERVE THE ADMINISTRATION THAT ALWAYS STOOD WITH THE AAPI COMMUNITY. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND IPHONE HARD TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY , OBAMA AND I FOUGHT HARD TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY. SECURE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR 2 MILLION ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE PROTECTED THOUSANDS OF AAPI DREAMERS GOING UP IN AMERICA. THE VERY PEOPLE NOW WHO ARE SAVING US, DOING THE JOBS AND RISKING LIVES. WE PROVIDED COMPENSATION FOR LONG OVERDUE , LONG OVERDUE COMPENSATION TO FILIPINO VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II. WE APPOINTED MAURYORE AAPI JUDGES TO THE BENCH THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION COMBINENED. WE ARE GOING TO STOP PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS TRACKS. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE TOGETHER AND ENSURE OUR GOVERNMENT ONCE AGAIN REFLECTS THE FULL DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY AND OUR COUNTRY AS A WHOLE INCLUDING MY CABINET. WE ARE TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE MADE TO DELIVER FOR THIS COMMUNITY ON HEALTH CARE, ON CLIMATE, ON BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT LEAVES NO ONE BEHIND. NOW, WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A TRAGEDY ON SO MANY LEVELS. THE PAIN WE ALL KNOW FROM FAIRLY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS IS SO STARK. SO CONSUMING. IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE ANYTHING BEYOND THAT PAIN. WE ARE GOING TO EMERGE FROM THIS MOMENT. WHEN WE DO, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE OF THE MOST BREATHTAKING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION. TO TAKE THIS. WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE DOCTORS, NURSES AND EMTS PUTTING THE LIVES ON THE LINE FOR US AND NY LOSING THEIR LIVES. A PUBLIC TRANSIT WORKER, GROCERY STORE CLERK CARRYING THE NATION ON THEIR B BACKS. ORDINARY AMERICANS SAYING, NO TO HATE, NO TO FEAR AND NO TO APATHY. REACHING OUT TO STRANGERS, CHECKING IN ON A FRIEND. WE CAN TAKE THAT SPIRIT. THE SOUL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND REBUILD THE COUNTRY IN ITS IMAGE. THIS MOMENT CAN BE AND MUST BE A STIRRING REMINDER OF WHO WE ARE, OF WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS REALLY ABOUT. I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THE WORLD AND TO PROVE TO OURSELVES WHAT AMERICA IS CAPABLE OF AT OUR BEST. TO FINALLY INVEST IN WORKERS. TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND BASED ON RACE, RELIGION, COLOR, ETHNICITY, DISABILITY. WE KNOW JUST HOW ESSENTIAL THEY TRULY ARE. TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY WHERE EVERYONE HAS A MYOPIC , AN OPPORTUNITY. MAKE SURE EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY IS TREATED WITH DEITY AND RESPECT. MY DAD USED TO SAY, EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT. WHETHER THERE IS A GUY SHINING THE SHOES OR THE PRESIDENT OF THE HOTEL CHAIN. WE HAVE A STRONG AND RESILIENT SAFETY NET WE HAVE TO RECONSTRUCT TO KEEP US GOING WHEN HARD TIMES HIT. I REVIEW RIGHT NOW MAY BE LIMITED BY THE BACKYARD IN THE BASEMENT AND THE SCENES OF OUR DEVICES, THAT I HOPE YOU WILL SEE WHAT I SEE. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SEPARATED PHYSICALLY, AND ENDURING DIFFICULT TIMES, I GIVE MY WORD I SEE A NATION GETTING READY TO COME TOGETHER. THE AAPI COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE BROKEN. OUR COMMUNITY AS A COUNTRY, OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY, WHICH IS A COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE BROKEN. NOT BY THIS PANDEMIC, NOT BY ANYTHING. NOT AS LONG AS WE STAND UNITED. WE ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS. WE CAN COME OUT ON THE OTHERS MUCH STRONGER, MUCH KINDER, MUCH CLOSER. JUST MORE RESILIENT THAN WE HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE. MCGREW, , REMEMBER, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAS TO GREAT CRISES AND AT THE END COME OUOUT STRONGER. WE NEED TO REMEMBER WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH IF WE WORK TOGETHER. COME THIS NOVEMBER, WITH YOUR HELP IN THE HELP OF THE ENTIRE ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY, WE ARE GOING TO PROVE IT. WE ARE GOING TO BE TOGETHER. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER. WE ARE GOING TO REMEMBER ALL THOSE WHO CARRIED US ON OUR , ON THEIR BACK THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. ORDINARY PEOPLE GETTING A CHANGE.

THE SAME THING HAPPENED WITH BREONNA TAYLOR, AHMAUD ARBERY. WE HAVE SPOKEN THEIR NAMES ALOUD. WE CRIED THEM OUT IN PAIN AND HORROR. WE TURNED INTO A LONG, SUFFERING CHORUS. IT IS THE LATEST ADDITION TO THE ENDLESS LIST, A LIST THAT DATES BACK MORE THAN 400 YEARS, BLACK MEN, BLACK WOMEN, BLACK CHILDREN. THE ORIGINAL SIN OF THIS COUNTRY STILL STAINS OUR NATION TODAY, AND SOMETIMES WE MANAGE TO OVERLOOK IT. WE PUSH FORWARD WITH A THOUSAND OTHER TASKS IN OUR DAILY LIVES, BUT IT IS ALWAYS THERE. IN WEEKS LIKE THIS, WE SEE IT PLAINLY, THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY WITH AN OPEN WOUND. NONE OF US CAN BE SILENT. NONE OF US CAN ANY LONGER HEAR THE WORDS \"I CAN'T BREATHE\" AND DO NOTHING. WE CAN'T FAIL VICTIMS LIKE WHAT MARTIN LUTHER KING CALLED THE APPALLING SILENCE OF GOOD PEOPLE. EVERY DAY, AFRICAN-AMERICANS GO ABOUT THEIR LIVES WITH THE CONSTANT ANXIETY. IMAGINE IF EVERY TIME YOUR HUSBAND OR SON, WIFE OR DAUGHTER LEFT THE HOUSE, YOU FEARED FOR THEIR SAFETY FROM BAD ACTORS AND BAD POLICE. IMAGINE IF YOU HAD TO HAVE THAT TALK WITH YOUR CHILD ABOUT NOT ASSERTING YOUR RIGHTS, TAKING THE ABUSE IMAGINE HAVING POLICE CALL ON YOU, SITTING IN STARBUCKS OR RENTING AN AIRBNB OR WATCHING BIRDS. THIS IS THE NORM BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY DEAL WITH. THEY DON'T HAVE TO IMAGINE IT. THE ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AND EXHAUSTION IS UNDENIABLE. BUT THAT IS NOT THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. IT IS LONG PAST TIME THAT WE MADE THE PROMISE OF THIS NATION REAL FOR ALL PEOPLE. THIS IS NO TIME FOR INCENDIARY TWEETS. NO TIME TO ENCOURAGE VIOLENCE. THIS IS A NATIONAL CRISIS, WE NEED REAL LEADERSHIP, LEADERSHIP THAT WILL BRING EVERYONE TO THE TABLE SO WE CAN TAKE MEASURES, ROOT OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM. IT IS TIME TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS, IT IS TIME FOR US TO FACE THAT DEEP, OPEN WOUND WE HAVE IN THIS NATION. WE NEED JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD. WE NEED REAL POLICE REFORM, HOLD COPS TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAT SO , THAT HOLD BAD COPS ACCOUNTABLE. THAT REPAIRS RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY THEY ARE SWORN TO PROTECT. WE NEED TO STAND UP AS A NATION WITH THE BLACK COMMUNITY, WITH ALL MINORITY COMMUNITIES, AND COME TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICA. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WE FACE. IT IS GOING TO REQUIRE THOSE OF US WHO SIT IN SOME POSITION OF INFLUENCE TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE OF POWER, THE PAIN IS TOO IMMENSE FOR ONE COMMUNITY TO BEAR ALONE. I BELIEVE IT IS THE DUTY OF EVERY AMERICAN TO GRAPPLE WITH IT AND GRAPPLE WITH IT NOW. WITH OUR COMPLACENCY, OUR SILENCE, WE ARE COMPLICIT IN PERPETUATING THESE CYCLES OF VIOLENCE. NOTHING ABOUT THIS WILL BE EASY OR COMFORTABLE. IF WE ALLOW THIS WOUND TO SCABBED OVER ONCE MORE WITHOUT TREATING THE UNDERLYING INDUSTRY , INJURY, WE WILL NEVER TRULY HEAL. THE VERY SOUL OF AMERICA IS AT STAKE. WE MUST COMMIT AS A NATION TO PURSUE JUSTICE WITH EVERY OUNCE OF OUR BEING, WE HAVE TO PURSUE IT WITH REAL URGENCY. WE HAVE TO MAKE REAL THE PROMISE OF AMERICA, WHICH IT NEVER FULLY GRASPED, THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE EQUAL. NOT ONLY IN CREATION, BUT THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES. TO GEORGE'S FAMILY, INC. FOR TAKING THE TIME TO TALK TO ME. I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU, WE WILL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO SEE TO IT THAT JUSTICE IS HAD AND YOUR BROTHER, COUSIN , FOLKS, WE HAVE TO STAND UP. WE'VE GOT TO MOVE. GOT TO CHANGE.

THIS IS JUST OVER 20 MINUTES. [APPLAUSE] MR. MAYOR, THANKS FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY, AND TO ALL THE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT ARE HERE, I BRING YOU GREETINGS. I CAN'T BREATHE. I CAN'T BREATHE. GEORGE FLOYD'S LAST WORDS, BUT IT DIDN'T DIE WITH THEM, ARE STILL BEING HEARD ECHOING ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. THEY SPEAK TO A NATION WHERE TOO OFTEN JUST THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN PUT YOUR LIFE AT RISK. THEY SPEAK TO A NATION WHERE MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO VIOLENCE, 40 MILLION HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT WITH A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF THOSE DEATHS AND JOB LOSSES CONCENTRATED IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. THEY SPEAK TO A NATION WHERE EVERY DAY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, AND MILLIONS, NOT A MOMENT OF LOSING THE LIGHT BUT IN THE COURSE OF LIVING THE LIFE ARE SAYING TO THEMSELVES, I CAN'T BREATHE. IT'S A WAKE-UP CALL TO OUR NATION IN MY VIEW. IT'S FOR ALL OF US, AND I MEAN ALL OF US. IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME WE HEARD THOSE WORDS. THEY ARE THE SAME WORDS WE HEARD FROM ERIC GARNER WHEN HIS LIFE WAS TAKEN AWAY SIX YEARS AGO. BUT IT'S TIME TO LISTEN TO THOSE WORDS COME TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THEM, TO RESPOND TO THEM, RESPOND WITH ACTION. THEY COUNTRY IS CRYING OUT FOR LEADERSHIP, LEADERSHIP BACK TONIGHT AS COME LEADERSHIP THAT BRINGS US TOGETHER. LEADERSHIP THAT CAN RECOGNIZE PAIN AND DEEP GRIEF OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAD A KNEE ON THEIR FOR A LONG TIME. THERE IS NO PLACE FOR VIOLENCE, NO PLACE FOR LOOTING OR DESTROYING PROPERTY OR BURNING CHURCHES OR DESTROYING BUSINESSES. MANY OF THEM BY THE PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO IN THE FIRST TIME THE LIGHTS WERE BEGINNING TO REALIZE THEIR DREAMS AND BUILD WEALTH FOR THE PHILLIES. NOR IS IT ACCEPTABLE FOR OUR POLICE SWORN TO PROTECT AND SERVE ALL PEOPLE TO RESORT TO EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE. WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN LEGITIMATE PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND OPPORTUNITIES VIOLENT DESTRUCTION. WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT ABOUT THE VIOLENCE THAT'S BEING DONE BY THIS INCUMBENT PRESIDENT TO OUR ECONOMY INTO THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE. WHEN PEACEFUL PROTESTERS DISPERSED IN ORDER FOR PRESIDENT, A PRESIDENT, FROM THE DOORSTEP OF THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE, THE WHITE HOUSE, USING TEAR GAS AND FLASH GRENADES IN ORDER TO STAGE A PHOTO OP, A PHOTO OP AMONG ONE OF THE MOST RESTORATIVE CHURCHES IN THE COUNTRY, RELEASE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., WE CAN BE FORGIVEN FOR BELIEVING THE PRESENT IS MORE INTERESTED IN POWER THAN IN PRINCIPLE. JUST SERVING THE PASSIONS OF HIS BASE AND THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE IN HIS CARE. FOR THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENCY IS, THE DUTY TO CARE, TO CARE FOR ALL OF US, NOT JUST THOSE WHO VOTE FOR US BUT ALL OF US. NOT JUST OUR DONORS, BUT ALL OF US. THE PRESIDENT HELD UP THE BIBLE AT ST. JOHN'S CHURCH YESTERDAY. I JUST WISH HE OPENED IT ONCE IN A WHILE INSTEAD OF BRANDISHING IT. HE OPENED IT HE COULD'VE LEARNED SOMETHING. THEY ARE ALL CALLED TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER THROUGH LOVE OURSELVES BUT IT'S REALLY, REALLY HARD WORK BUT IT'S A WORK OF AMERICA. DONALD TRUMP ISN'T INTERESTED IN DOING THAT WORK. INSTEAD HE'S SWEEPING AWAY ALL THE GUARDRAILS THAT PAUL PROTECTED OUR DEMOCRACY, GUARDRAILS THAT HAVE HELPED MAKE POSSIBLE THIS NATION'S PATH TO A MORE PERFECT UNION. A UNION THAT CONSTANTLY REQUIRES REFORM AND REDEDICATION, AND YES, THE PROTESTS FROM VOICES THAT ARE MISTREATED, IGNORED, LEFT OUT OR LEFT BEHIND. BUT IT IS A UNION, A UNION WORTH FIGHTING FOR, , AND THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. IN ADDITION TO THE BIBLE, PRESIDENT MIGHT ALSO WANT TO OPEN THE U.S. CONSTITUTION ONCE IN A WHILE. IF HE DID HE WOULD FIND A THING CALLED THE FIRST AMENDMENT. AND WHAT IT SAYS IN THE BEGINNING, IT SAYS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE PEACEABLY TO ASSEMBLE, AND TO PETITION THEIR GOVERNMENT FOR REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES. THAT'S KIND OF A SENSIBLE NOTION, BUILT INTO THIS COUNTRY. MR. PRESIDENT, THAT'S AMERICA. THAT'S AMERICA. NO HORSES RISING UP ON THEIR ON THE HIND LEGS TO PUSH BACK PEACEFUL PROTESTS, NOT USING THE AMERICAN MILITARY TO MOVE AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS A NATION OF VALUES. OUR FREEDOM TO SPEAK AS THEY CHERISHED KNOWLEDGE THAT LIVES INSIDE OF THE AMERICAN ALMOST FROM THE TIME YOU ARE A KID. WE'RE NOT ALLOWED ANY PRESIDENT TO QUITE OUR VOICE. WE WILL NOT LET THOSE WHO SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SOW CHAOS, THREW UP A SMOKESCREEN, TO DISTRACT US FROM THE REAL LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCES AT THE HEART OF THESE PROTESTS. WE CAN'T LEAVE THIS MOMENT. WE CAN'T LEAVE THIS MOMENT THINKING THAT WE CAN ONCE AGAIN TURN AWAY AND DO NOTHING. WE CAN'T DO THAT THIS TIME. WE JUST CAN'T. THE MOMENT HAS COME FOR OUR NATION TO DEAL WITH SYSTEMIC RACISM, TO DEAL WITH THE GROWING ECONOMIC INEQUITY THAT EXISTS IN OUR NATION, TO DEAL WITH THE DENIAL OF A PROMISE OF THIS NATION, MAY 2 SO MANY. YOU KNOW, , I SAID FROM THE OUTSET OF THIS ELECTION THAT WERE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION, AND WE ARE IN THE BATTLE OF THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. WHAT WE BELIEVE, MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT WE WANT TO BE, IT'S ALL AT STAKE. THAT'S TRUER TODAY THAN IT IS EVER BEEN AT LEAST IN MY LIFETIME. AND IT'S THIS URGENCY, IT'S IN THIS URGENCY, WE CAN FIND A PATH FORWARD. NOW, THE HISTORY OF THIS NATION TEACHES US THAT IN SOME OF OUR DARKEST MOMENTS OF DESPAIR WE MADE SOME OF HER GREATEST PROGRESS, SOME OF OUR DARKEST MOMENTS, , THE 13th, 14th, 15th AMENDMENTS FOLLOWING THE CIVIL WAR. THE GREATEST ECONOMIC GROWTH IN WORLD HISTORY GREW OUT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1864 AND THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 65, CAME IN THE TRACKS OF BULL CONNORS ATTACKS A VICIOUS DOG. TO PARAPHRASE, IT'S THE MORNING WE FIND HOPE. IT'S IN THE MORNING WE FIND HOPE WHEN WE MOURN. BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN TALK. WE HAD TALKED BEFORE. WE HAVE PROTESTS BEFORE. WE GOT TO NOW ABOUT TO MAKE IT'S AT LEAST AN ERA OF ACTION AND REVERSED THE SYSTEMIC RACISM WITH A LONG OVERDUE CONCRETE CHANGES. THE ACTION WILL NOT BE COMPLETED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF MY PRESIDENCY AND FIND FORTUNE TO HAVE TO BE ELECTED, OR EVEN IN MY ENTIRE TERM. IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE WORK OF A GENERATION, BUT THIS AGENDA WILL TAKE TIME TO COMPLETE, IT SHOULD NOT WAIT FOR THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF MY PRESIDENCY TO GET STARTED. A DOWN PAYMENT ON WHAT IS LONG OVERDUE SHOULD COME NOW, SHOULD COME IMMEDIATELY. I CALL ON THE CONGRESS TO ACT THIS MONTH ON MEASURES THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP IN THIS DIRECTION, STARTING WITH REAL POLICE REFORM. CONGRESSMAN JEFFRIES HAS A BILL TO OUTLAW CHOKE HOLDS. CONGRESS SHOULD PUT IT ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK IS THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES TO STOP TRANSFERRING WEAPONS ABORTIVE POLICE FORCES COME TO CREATE A MODEL USE OF FORCE STANDARD. THAT ALSO SHOULD BE MADE LAW THIS MONTH. NO MORE EXCUSES, NO DELAYS. IF MITCH McCONNELL CAN BREAK INTO THE TRADED SET IT TO CONFIRM TRUMP'S UNQUALIFIED JUDICIAL NOMINEE WHO WILL RUN ROUGHSHOD OVER OUR CONSTITUTION NOW, IT'S TIME TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT WILL GIVE TOO MANY TO OUR CONSTITUTIONAL PROMISE EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER LAW. LOOKING HIT IN THE FIRST ONE DEBATES ONE OF DAYS OF MY PRESIDENCY I'VE COMMITTED TO GREAT AND OVERSIGHT COMMISSIONER COMMISSION. LONGLEAF WE NEED REAL COMMUNITY POLICING. WE NEED EACH AND EVERY POLICE DEPARTMENT IN THE COUNTRY UNDERSTAND A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF, OF THEIR HIRING, TRAINING, DE-ESCALATION. SOME HAVE ALREADY DONE AND SOME ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING IT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD GIVE, GIVE THE CITY ESTATES THE TOOLS AND THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS. MORE POLICE OFFICERS MEET THE HIGHER STANDARD OF THEIR , MOST OF THEM DO IT. ALL THE MARS REASON WHY BAD COP SHOULD BE DEALT WITH SEVERELY AND SWIFTLY. WE ALL NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE CULTURE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE SENSELESS TRAGEDY THAT KEEP HAPPENING. WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THE CITY'S AND THE PRECINCTS THAT ARE GETTING IT RIGHT. WE KNOW THOUGH IN ORDER TO HAVE TRUE AMERICAN JUSTICE WE DID ECONOMIC JUSTICE AS WELL. HERE, TOO, THERE'S MUCH TO BE DONE. AS AN IMMEDIATE STEPS CONGRESS SHOULD ACT, , SHOULD ACT NOW TO RECTIFY RACIAL INEQUITIES THAT ALLOW COVID-19 RECOVERY FUNDS TO BE DIVERTED FROM WHERE THEY LIVE. I'LL BE SETTING FORTH MY AGENDA ON ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND OPPORTUNITY IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD, BUT IT BEGINS WITH HEALTHCARE. HEALTHCARE SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE, AND THE QUICKEST ROUTE TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN THIS COUNTRY IS TO EXPAND ON OBAMACARE. WE CAN DO IT. WE SHOULD DO IT. BUT THIS PRESIDENT, EVEN NOW, IN THE MIDST OF A A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS WITH MASSIVE UNEMPLOYMENT AS WELL WANTS TO DESTROY IT. HE DOESN'T CARE HOW MANY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL BE HURT BECAUSE HE CONSUMED WITH HIS BLINDING EGO WHEN IT COMES TO BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OBAMA. THE PRESIDENT SHOULD WITHDRAW HIS LAWSUIT TO STRIKE AND OBAMACARE AND THE SHOULD PREPARE TO PASS THE ACT I PROPOSE TO EXPAND OBAMACARE TO MILLIONS MORE SO EVERYONE IS COVERED. THESE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE SEEN AMERICA'S TRUE HEROES. HEALTHCARE WORKERS, DOCTORS, NURSES, DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVERS, GROCERY STORE WORKERS. WE'VE COME UP WITH A NEW PHRASE FOR THEM, ESSENTIAL WORKERS. ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN PRAISE OF THEM. WE NEED TO PAY THEM. WE NEED TO PAY THEM. BECAUSE IF IT WERE NOT CLEAR BEFORE, IT'S CLEAR NOW. THIS COUNTRY WASN'T BUILT BY WALL STREET BANKERS AND CEOs. IT WAS BUILT BY THE GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS WHICH IS BUILT BY UNIONS AND ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. I KNOW THERE'S A MOMENT OF UNCERTAINTY AND ANGER IN THE COUNTRY. I UNDERSTAND. I KNOW SO MANY AMERICANS ARE SUFFERING, SUFFERING THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE, SUFFERING ECONOMIC HARDSHIP, WONDERING HOW THEY FEED MY FAMILY TOMORROW. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? SUFFERING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A GENERATION AFTER GENERATION AFTER GENERATION OF HURT INFLICTED ON PEOPLE OF COLOR, LACK, BROWN AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR. LIKE MANY OF YOU I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO GRIEVE. MY LOSSES ARE NOT THE SAME AS LOSSES FELT BY SO MANY, BUT I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU THINK YOU CAN'T GO ON. I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE THAT BLACK HOLE IN YOUR CHEST WERE YOUR GRIEF IS BEING SUCKED INTO IT. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO MARKED THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF MY SONS PASSING. OF CANCER. THERE ARE STILL MOMENTS WHEN THE PAIN IS SO GREAT IT FEELS SO DIFFERENT THAN THE DAY I SAT IN THAT BED AS HE PASSED AWAY. BUT ALSO KNOW THAT THE BEST WAY TO BEAR LOSS IN PAIN IS TO TURN IT INTO THAT ANGER AND ANGUISH AND TO PURPOSE. AND AMERICANS KNOW WHAT OUR PURPOSE IS AS A NATION. IT HAS TO BE GUIDED, HAS TO BE GUIDED. IT'S GUIDED US FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. IT'S BEEN REPORTED TODAY THAT PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED, YOLANDA KING CAME FROM SCHOOL AND JUMPED INTO HER DADDIES ARMS AND SAID OH, DADDY, SHE SAID, NOW WE ARE NEVER GOING TO GET OUR FREEDOM. HER DADDY WAS REASSURING, STRONG AND BRAVE. HE SAID NO, DON'T WORRY, BABY. IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. AMID THE VIOLENCE AND FEAR, DR. KING PERSEVERED. HE WAS DRIVEN BY HIS DREAM OF A NATION WHERE JUSTICE RUNS DOWN LIKE WATER AND RUSHES LIKE A MIGHTY STREAM. THEN IN 1968, HATE CUTTING DOWN IN MEMPHIS. A FEW DAYS BEFORE DR. KING WAS MURDERED, HE GAVE A FINAL SUNDAY SERMON IN WASHINGTON. WHERE HE TOLD US THAT THE ARK OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE IS LONG, HE SAID THAT BEN'S TOWARDS JUSTICE. AND WE KNOW WE CAN BEND IT BECAUSE WE HAVE. WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT STILL. THAT'S OUR PURPOSE. IT'S BEEN OUR PURPOSE SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING. TO BECOME A NATION WHERE ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE NOT ONLY CREATING BUT THEY ARE TREATED EQUALLY. NOT JUST CREATED EQUAL, BUT TREATED EQUALLY. TO BECOME A NATION DEFINED IN DR. KING'S WORDS NOT ONLY WRITE ABSENCE OF TENSION BUT BY THE PRESENCE OF JUSTICE, NOT JUST ATTENTION BUT JUSTICE. TODAY IN AMERICA IT'S HARD TO KEEP FAITH. I KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW THAT YOUR PAIN IS WRONG. THE PAIN IS REAL. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MUST BE PART OF THE SOLUTION, NOT THE PROBLEM. BUT THIS PRESIDENT TODAY IS PART OF THE PROBLEM AND ACCELERATES IT. WHEN HE TREATED THE WORDS WHEN THE LOOTING STARTS, THE SHOOTING STARTS, THEY WEREN'T THE WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT. THEY WERE WORDS OF A RACIST MIAMI POLICE CHIEF IN THE '60s. WHEN HE TWEETED THAT PROTESTERS QUOTE, WOULD HAVE BEEN GREETED WITH THE MOST VICIOUS DOGS, WHEN PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY HURT, END OF QUOTE, THOSE WERE NOT THE WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT. THEY WERE THE KIND OF WORDS BULL CONNOR WHAT IT USED UNLEASHING HIS DOGS ON INNOCENT WOMEN AND CHILDREN. YOU KNOW, THE AMERICAN STORY IS A STORY ABOUT ACTION AND REACTION. THAT'S HOW HISTORY WORKS. WE CAN'T BE NAIVE ABOUT IT. I WISH I COULD SAY THAT HATE BEGAN WITH DONALD TRUMP AND WILL END WITH HIM. IT DIDN'T AND IT WON'T. AMERICAN HISTORY IS IN A FAIRYTALE WITH A GUARANTEED HAPPY ENDING. THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION HAS BEEN A CONSTANT PUSH AND PULL MORE THAN 240 YEARS, A TUG-OF-WAR BETWEEN THE AMERICAN IDEAL THAT WE ARE ALL GREATER EQUAL, THE HARSH REALITY THAT RACISM HAS LONG TOWARD US APART. THE HONEST TRUTH IS THAT BOTH ELEMENTS ARE PART OF THE AMERICAN CHARACTER. BOTH ELEMENTS. AT OUR BEST THE AMERICAN IDEAL WINS OUT, BUT IT'S NEVER A ROUTE. IT'S ALWAYS A FIGHT, AND THE BATTLE IS NEVER FULLY ONE. BUT WE CAN'T IGNORE THE TRUTH THAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST WOULD OPEN OUR HEARTS RATHER THAN CLINCHED OUR FISTS. DONALD TRUMP HAS TURNED THIS COUNTRY INTO A BATTLEFIELD DRIVEN BY OLD RESENTMENTS AND FRESH TEARS. HE THINKS THE VISION HELPS HIM. HIS NARCISSISM HAS BECOME MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NATION'S WELL-BEING THAT HE LEADS. I ASK EVERY AMERICAN, I MEAN JUST FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, I ASK OF THE AMERICAN LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE NOW IN THINK ANEW. IS THIS WHO WE ARE? IS THIS WHO WE WANT TO BE? IS THIS WHAT WE WANT TO PASS ONTO OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN? FEAR, ANGER, FINGER-POINTING RATHER THAN THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, INCOMPETENCE AND ANXIETY, SELF ABSORPTION, SELFISHNESS? OR DO WE WANT TO BE THE AMERICA WE KNOW WE CAN BE? THE AMERICA WE KNOW IN OUR HEARTS WE COULD BE AND SHOULD BE. LOOK, I LOOK AT THE PRESIDENCY AS A VERY GOOD JOB, AND NOBODY WILL GET IT RIGHT EVERY TIME. AND I WON'T EITHER, BUT I PROMISE YOU THIS, I WON'T FAN THE FLAMES OF HATE. I'LL SEEK TO HEAL THE RACIAL WOUNDS THAT HAVE LONG PLAGUED OUR COUNTRY, NOT USE THEM FOR POLITICAL GAIN. I'LL DO MY JOB AND I WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. I WON'T BLAME OTHERS. I'LL NEVER FORGET, I WILL NEVER FORGET, I PROMISE YOU, THIS JOB IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT'S ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT US. THE WORK NOW DON'T REBUILD THE NATION, BUT TO BUILD A BETTER THAN IT WAS WHERE THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD THAT GOES THE CRISIS AND COMES OUT BETTER. TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE, THAT'S WHAT AMERICA DOES, TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE. WE BUILD THE FUTURE. IT MAY, IN FACT, BE THE MOST AMERICAN THING TO DO, BUILD THE FUTURE. WE HUNGER FOR LIBERTY THE WAY HARRY TUBMAN AND FREDERICK DOUGLASS DID. WE THIRST FOR THE VOTE LIKE SUSAN B. ANTHONY AND ELLA BAKER AND JOHN LEWIS DID. WE STRIVE TO EXPLORE THE STARS, CURE DISEASE, MAKE AN IMPERFECT UNION MORE PERFECT THAN IT'S BEEN. WE MAY COME UP SHORT, BUT AT OUR BEST WE TRY. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE ARE FACING A FORMIDABLE ENEMIES. THEY INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE CORONAVIRUS AND THE TOTAL IMPACT AND THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS, ALSO THE SELFISHNESS AND FEAR THAT IF LOOMED OVER OUR NATIONAL LIFE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. I CHOOSE THOSE WORDS WISELY, SELFISHNESS AND FEAR. IF HE DOES ENEMIES REQUIRES US TO DO OUR DUTY, AND THAT DUTY INCLUDES REMEMBERING WHO WE SHOULD BE, WHO WE SHOULD BE. WE SHOULD BE THE AMERICA OF FDR AND EISENHOWER, OF ROSA PARKS AND MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., OF JONAS SALK AND NEIL ARMSTRONG. WE SHOULD BE THE AMERICA THAT CHERISHES LIFE, LIBERTY AND COURAGE. AND ABOVE ALL, WE SHOULD BE THE AMERICA THAT CHERISHES EACH OTHER, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US. YOU KNOW, WE'RE A NATION OF PAIN. WE MUST NOT LET OUR PAIN AND DESTROY US. WE A NATION ENRAGED BUT WE CANNOT LET OUR RAGE CONSUME US. WE'RE A NATION THAT IS EXHAUSTED, BUT WE WILL NOT ALLOW OUR EXHAUSTION TO DEFEAT US. AS PRESIDENT IT IS MY COMMITMENT TO ALL OF YOU TO LEAD ON THESE ISSUES AND TO LISTEN. BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE IN MY HEART OF HEARTS WE CAN OVERCOME. WE STAND TOGETHER, FINALLY AS ONE AMERICA, WE WILL MOVE THAT ARC CLOSER TO JUSTICE. WE WILL REACH OUT TO ONE ANOTHER, SO SPEAK OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER, AND PLEASE, PLEASE DO US WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING, TAKE CARE OF ONE ANOTHER. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DO WHEN WE SET OUR MIND TO DO IT, , AND WE HAVE DONE IT TOGETHER. TOGETHER, UNITED. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AT OUR BEST. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THE SENATE BREAKING FOR THE WEEKLY PARTY CAUCUS LUNCHES. SENATORS HAVE BEEN WORKED ON EXECUTIVE NOMINATIONS.

WATCH COVERAGE AT 4:00 EASTERN ON C-SPAN, AT C-SPAN.ORG, OR LISTEN WITH THE FREE C-SPAN RADIO APP. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING DR. ALLEN, A RESIDENT OF DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY, ONE OF THE GREAT HBCUS IN THE COUNTRY, FOR ACCOMMODATING US. IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK ON CAMPUS. I WISH IT WAS A MORE CELEBRATORY OCCASION. BEFORE I SPEAK TO THE ECONOMIC SITUATION, I HAVE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT SAID THIS MORNING. FOR THE END OF HIS REMARKS, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE HOPES THAT GEORGE FLOYD IS LOOKING DOWN AND SEEING THIS AS A GREAT DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE SPEAKING OF A MAN WHO WAS BRUTALLY KILLED BY AN ACT OF NEEDLESS VIOLENCE AND BY A LARGER TIDE OF INJUSTICE THAT HAS METASTASIZED ON THIS PRESIDENT'S WATCH AS HE HAS MOVED IS BASED ON RACE, ETHNICITY. GEORGE FLOYD'S LAST WORDS, I CAN'T BREATHE, I CAN'T BREATHE, HAVE ECHOED ACROSS THIS NATION AND AROUND THE WORLD. FOR THE PRESIDENT TO TRY TO PUT ANY OTHER WORDS IN THE MOUTH OF GEORGE FLOYD, I THINK IS DESPICABLE. THE FACT THAT HE DID SO ON THE DATE WHEN BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT ROSE, HISPANIC ON A LIMIT ROSE, BLACK YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT SKYROCKETED TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS MAN AND WHAT HE REALLY CARES ABOUT. TODAY, LIKE ALL AMERICANS, I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT 2.5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE GOTTEN THEIR JOBS BACK. FOR THOSE FAMILIES, THAT IS A SIGH OF RELIEF. FOR ALL THOSE OF US, IT REMINDS US OF THE RESILIENCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. TO THOSE AMERICANS, I'M PROUD OF YOU, HAPPY FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES. I WAS DISTURBED HOWEVER, TO CD THE PRESIDENT PROBING THIS MORNING, BASICALLY HANGING A MISSION ACCOMPLISHED BANNER OUT THERE, WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE, SO MANY AMERICANS ARE STILL HURTING. MORE THAN 20 MILLION AMERICANS, ONE OF EVERY SEVEN U.S. WORKERS IS OUT OF WORK. FOR AN HONEST SWATH OF OUR COUNTRY, THEIR DREAMS ARE ON HOLD AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND WONDERING WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW, CAN I PAY MY RENT? WILL I BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN MY MORTGAGE PAYMENT? THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE REMAINS THE HIGHEST IT HAS BEEN IN NEARLY A CENTURY. AS I SAID, LIKE EMPLOYMENT WENT UP THIS MONTH. LATINO UNEMPLOYMENT JUMPED TO OVER 37%. HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT OVERALL IS FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE PRESIDENT BOTCHED HIS RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND I'M WORRIED. WHEN YOU LOOK DEEPER INTO THE DATA, WHILE TEMPORARY LAYOFFS WENT DOWN, PERMANENT LAYOFFS WENT UP. DONALD TRUMP STILL DOES NOT GET IT. HE IS SPIKING THE BALL, COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS TO THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE FACING THE GREATEST STRUGGLE OF THEIR LIVES. THESE FOLKS ARE NOT FEELING ANY LESS PAIN TODAY THAN THEY WERE YESTERDAY. PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR HEALTH CARE IN THE CRISIS, THEY ARE NOT CELEBRATING. ESPECIALLY WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS STILL GOING TO FEDERAL COURT, FIGHTING TO STRIP AWAY THE HEALTH CARE PROTECTIONS FOR MORE AMERICANS. THE FACT IS, ABOUT 13 MILLION FEWER JOBS TODAY FOR AMERICAN WORKERS THAN THE DAY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I LEFT OFFICE. WHILE IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE 10% OF THE FAMILIES WHO LOST THEIR JOBS DUE TO TRUMPS PANDEMIC RESPONSE START TO MAKE THEIR WAY BACK, THE PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR MAKES ME WORRIED FOR THE 90% YOU HAVEN'T. ALL THOSE FAMILIES WHO ARE SCARED, WHO ARE FRIGHTENED, HURTING, WERE WONDERING, BUT IT'S WHEN YOU HAPPEN NEXT? I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I AND A LOT OF OTHERS SEE YOU, WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN YOU. I WANT TO BE SATISFIED UNTIL THIS COUNTRY STARTS WORKING FOR EVERYONE. WHICH IS NOT NOW. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING. THE DEPTH OF THIS JOB CRISIS IS NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN ACT OF GOD, BUT TO A FAILURE OF A PRESIDENT. THE TRUTH IS, EVERY COUNTRY DEALT WITH THEIR JOB LOSSES DUE TO THIS PANDEMIC, BUT AMERICA WAS HIT MUCH HARDER, OUT OF THE GATE, DUE TO THE INCOMPETENCE AND MISMANAGEMENT OF THE RESPONSE. THIS MORNING, THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO COMPARE THE RESPONSE OF GERMANY AND SOUTH KOREA , OK, LET'S COMPARE. GERMANY HAS ONE THIRD OF THE DEATHS PER CAPITA THAN WE DO. SOUTH KOREA HAS LESS THAN 300 DEATHS TOTAL. AMERICA HAS 4% OF THE WORLD POPULATION. AND A QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S DEATH DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. 4% OF THE POPULATION, A QUARTER OF THE DEATHS. IT IS NO SECRET WHY. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT. THE PRESIDENT DID NOT ACT QUICKLY WHEN HE WAS WARNED TO ACT, WHEN HE WAS , EVEN WHEN HIS OWN TEAM TALKED ABOUT ENACTING. FOUR MONTHS, HE DOWNPLAYED THE THREAT, FALSELY PROMISING THAT EVERY THINK WAS GOING TO , EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO GET A TEST, CLAIMING THAT, LIKE AMERICA, THIS WILL DISAPPEAR. HE REPEATEDLY PRAISED CHINA'S CONTAINMENT RESPONSE, DESPITE PUBLIC APPEALS FROM MANY PEOPLE, INCLUDING BE IN JANUARY, NOT TO LET AMERICAN LIVES AND THE U.S. ECONOMY HANG ON HIS CONFIDENCE TO THE CHINESE CONFIDENT , HIS CONFIDENCE THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WAS BEING TRUTHFUL. HE REFUSED TO TAKE ACTION TO GET ADEQUATE TESTING IN PLACE, ALLOWING THE VIRUS TO SPREAD FURTHER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY FOUND THAT 54,000 AMERICANS WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY, LIVES SAVED, IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAD ACTED TWO WEEKS EARLIER. THIS FAILURE DID NOT JUST BECAUSE LIVES. IT COSTS JOBS. NEW STUDIES FROM MOODY'S AND BROOKINGS CONFIRM THAT HALF OR MORE OF THOSE WHO BOUGHT THEIR JOB WOULD STILL BE EMPLOYED HAD DONALD TRUMP HAD A COMPETENT RESPONSE LIKE GERMANY AND SOUTH KOREA AND OTHER COUNTRIES DID. WE KNOW WHY THIS HAPPENED. DONALD TRUMP WAS MORE FOCUSED ON THE STOCK WEALTH OF THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS THAT HE WAS ON THE WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY HE AND HIS TOP ECONOMIC ADVISERS ARE TELLING PEOPLE, I STOCKS, AND SET PREPARING OUR NATION TO BRACE FOR THIS PANDEMIC. AFTER 110,000 AMERICAN DEATHS, MORE THAN 20 MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF WORK, THE CONSEQUENCES ARE CLEAR. WE ARE FACING DEVASTATING UNEMPLOYMENT AND A HISTORIC HEALTH CRISIS. A CONTINUING CRISIS OF VIOLENCE AND INDIGNITY, THAT HAS DEVASTATED BLACK AMERICANS, MANY LATINOS, WE ARE LOSING THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. SOME OF THE STARTED CHALLENGES OUR NATION HAS EVER FACED, AND DONALD TRUMP IS PATTING HIMSELF ON THE BACK. HE HAS NO IDEA, IN MY VIEW, WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY. HE HAS NO IDEA BE DEPTH OF THE PAIN THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE ENDURING. HE REMAINS OBLIVIOUS TO THE HUMAN TOLL OF HIS INDIFFERENCE. IT IS TIME FOR HIM TO STOP OUT OF HIS BUNKER, TAKE A LOOK AROUND AT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS WORDS AND ACTIONS. LET'S BE CLEAR, THE PRESIDENT WHO TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR COSTING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS THEIR JOBS DESERVES NO CREDIT WHEN A FRACTION OF THEM RETURN. BUT THERE IS A DEEPER CONCERN HERE. AS WE RECOVER, SOME OF THE TEMPORARY JOB LOSSES ARE STILL NOT ON TRACK TO GO BACK IN A WAY THAT WILL ACTUALLY REALLY SERVE WORKING PEOPLE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL REWARDING WEALTH OVER WORK. I'LL BE HERE COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE IS CALLS FOR MORE TAX CUTS, BIG INVESTORS, A CORPORATIONS, WHEN THEY DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S WHO I FIGHT FOR. IF TRUMP CONTINUES TO PUT THE INTEREST OF CEOS AND SHAREHOLDERS AHEAD OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, WE WILL NEVER GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN THIS COUNTRY. EVERY AMERICAN HAS A CHOICE TO MAKE IN NOVEMBER, NOT SIMPLY TO WHO THEY WILL HAVE AS A PRESIDENT OR SENATOR OR CONGRESSPEOPLE, BUT WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY DO WE WANT TO BE? WHAT KIND OF ECONOMY TO BE WANT? AND WHO WILL IT SERVE? IN THE COMING WEEKS, I'VE LAID OUT A PLAN I HAVE DEVELOPED FOR MY PLAN NOT JUST TO BUILD BACK THE ECONOMY THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE COVID-19, BUT TO BUILD IT BACK BETTER. IT WAS ALREADY HURTING FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. A PLAN TO CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS WITH BENEFITS WHERE PEOPLE GET A FAIR RETURN ON WORK, MAKE THE COUNTRY STRONGER, MORE JUST. AS YOU WILL SEE, THAT PLAN IS CRATING INVESTMENTS IN SMALL BUSINESSES, TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, INVESTING IN INNOVATION, MANUFACTURING, CAREGIVING, AND REWIRING THE FAULTY STRUCTURES OF OUR ECONOMY TO ENSURE THE DIGNITY AND EQUALITY FOR ALL AMERICAN WORKERS. THERE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, A JOB CRISIS, A CRISIS OF INEQUITY BEING ENTERED BY AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR. THOSE THREE CHALLENGES ALONE ARE DEEPLY CONNECTED TO ONE ANOTHER. THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO BE CONNECTED AS WELL. ANY ECONOMIC PLAN MUST START WITH A PUBLIC HEALTH PLAN TO ENSURE TESTS ARE AVAILABLE AND TRACING. TO BUILD BACK THE CONFIDENCE WE NEED TO BRING BACK JOBS IN SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP. MY JOB PLAN TALKS ABOUT RESTORING THE DIGNITY TO AMERICAN PEOPLE IN ADDITION TO PURSUING NEEDED REFORMS, WE NEED TO GROW WAGES, LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD, CREATE TENS OF MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS TO BUILD A BETTER AMERICAN FUTURE. THERE IS A MONUMENTAL AMOUNT OF WORK TO BE DONE TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE INSTANTLY TWEETING SLOGANS LIKE TRANSITION TO GREATNESS WILL SOLVE ANYTHING FOR THE FAMILIES WHO ARE HURTING AND WONDERING, WHERE DO I GO NEXT? I LOOK FORWARD TO INTRODUCING , I WOULD HAVE ALREADY DONE IT HAD WE NOT HAD THE DEATH , TORTA NOT BEEN HELD UP AGAINST THAT CURB, I WOULD PLAN ON INTRODUCING IT EARLIER, BUT I WILL INTRODUCE IT QUICKLY, IMPLEMENTING REAL JOB PLAN THAT WILL CREATE AND MEET THIS MORMON , THIS MOMENT. AMERICANS CANNOT AFFORD TO MORE TIME WASTED. THEY NEED AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR THEM AND THEY NEED IT NOW. THEY NEED JOBS THAT BRING DIGNITY AND NEED IT NOW. THEY NEED EQUAL JUSTICE AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY NOW. THEY NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CARES ABOUT THEM, WHO CARES ABOUT HELPING THEM HEAL NOW. I CAN'T WAIT. THE RESPONSE OF SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD, ACROSS THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING MANY OF OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, FORMER MILITARY COMMANDERS, ETC. IS CRYING OUT. WE NEED JUSTICE, OPPORTUNITY, AND HOPE. I HAVE FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE GIVE THEM HAVE A CHANCE, THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN'T DO. WE NEED TO UNITE AS ONE NATION, WHEN WE HAVE, WE HAVE NEVER FAILED. TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT FACE US AT THE MOMENT. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.

WE'RE TAKING YOUR CALLS LIVE ON THE AIR ON THE NEWS OF THE DAY AND DISCUSSING POLICY ISSUES THAT IMPACT YOU. COMING UP FRIDAY MORNING, FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER BERNARD KERIK ON EFFORTS TO REFORM POLICING IN THE U.S. AND REVEREND HARRIS, CO CHAIR OF THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN TALKS ABOUT RACIAL AND ECONOMIC INJUSTICE AND THE ROLE CLERGY PLAY IN THE FIGHT FOR EQUALITY. WATCH C-SPAN'S \"WASHINGTON JOURNAL\" LIVE AT 7:00 EASTERN FRIDAY MORNING, AND BE SURE TO JOIN THE DISCUSSION WITH YOUR PHONE CALLS, FACEBOOK COMMENTS, TEXT MESSAGES AND TWEETS. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN TALKED ABOUT REOPENING THE ECONOMY. HE CALLED ON PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CONGRESS TO EXTEND SUPPORT FOR BUSINESSES AND WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND TO CREATE MORE ACCESS TO TESTING AND CONTACT TRACING. HE SPOKE IN DARBY, PENNSYLVANIA, AFTER MEETING WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE SLIGHT DELAY. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE WAS ABLE TO GET HERE. LET ME THANK THE LOCAL OFFICIALS FOR JOINING TODAY. I KNOW THEY HAVE A LOT TO DO, AND THEY HAVE REALLY BEEN VERY VERY BUSY. BEFORE I BEGIN MY REMARKS, I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY WHEN A WHITE SUPREMACIST WALKED INTO MOTHER EMANUEL CHURCH IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, AND SLAUGHTERED A FRIEND OF MINE, CLEMENTE PINCKNEY AND EIGHT OTHER PARISHIONERS. IT WAS A HATE UNBRIDLED, AND IT WAS POISONOUS, A POISONOUS EXPRESSION OF WHITE SUPREMACY THAT STILL AFFECTS OUR NATION AND MANY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. AND ON THE DANGERS WE FACE AS A SOCIETY IF WE DON'T ROOT OUT THIS CORROSIVE AND DEADLY IDEOLOGY. I REFLECT ON THE AMAZING GRACE, COMPASSION, AND THE FORGIVENESS OF THE MOTHER EMANUEL COMMUNITY. I SEE THE VERY BEST IN WHAT WE SEE IN AMERICA, AS AMERICANS. BUT WE KNOW THAT GRACE ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE TO PUT IT TO WORK, THAT GRACE. WE'RE SEEING THE BEST OF AMERICA IN THAT AS WELL. IN THE WEEKS OF PEACEFUL PROTESTS, CIVIL ACTIONS TAKING PLACE, IN CITIES AND TOWNS OF EVERY SIZE, IN THIS STATE AND OVER OTHER STATE ACROSS THE , AND EVERY OTHER STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE ARE KEEPING THEIR EYES FOCUSED ON HOW MUCH DANGER IT IS TO LIVE A LIFE OF A BLACK OR A BROWN-SKINNED PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY. AMERICANS ARE OUT THERE MARCHING, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. THAT'S HOW CRITICAL THEY THINK IT IS. ON MONDAY, DONALD TRUMP SAID QUOTE IF WE STOPPED TESTING RIGHT NOW, FOR COVID-19, WE'D HAVE VERY FEW CASES, IF ANY. IF WE STOPPED TESTING NOW, WE WOULD HAVE VERY FEW CASES, IF ANY. IT'S A STATEMENT THAT'S NOT ONLY ABSURD, IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRAGIC. YESTERDAY THE HEAD OF THE WHITE HOUSE TASK FORCE ON CORONAVIRUS, THE VICE PRESIDENT, CLAIMED SUCCESS IN THE FIGHT BECAUSE DEATHS ARE QUOTE DOWN TO FEWER THAN 750 A DAY. 750 FATHERS, MOTHERS, SISTERS, BROTHERS, UNCLES, AUNTS, HUSBANDS, WIVES, CHILDREN, DYING EVERY DAY. MORE THAN 20,000 A MONTH. THAT'S GREATER THAN WORLD WAR II LEVEL CASUALTIES EACH MONTH. THAT'S MORE THAN FIVE 9\/11S EACH MONTH. AND THIS ADMINISTRATION IS ENGAGING IN SELF-CONGRATULATIONS? IT MAY BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR DONALD TRUMP. BUT IT WILL NEVER EVER BE ACCEPTABLE IF I'M YOUR PRESIDENT. RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS HAVE DIED NEEDLESSLY BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP WAS SLOW TO RESPOND TO THE CRISIS, AND THEN WHEN HE DID, HE BUNGLED THE RESPONSE. FOR WEEKS IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY, I WAS RAISING MY CONCERNS ON HOW WE NEED TO TAKE THIS VIRUS SERIOUSLY. ALL WHILE TRUMP WAS IGNORING THE REPORTING FROM HIS OWN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IN HIS DAILY BRIEFINGS. AND THE WARNINGS OF HIS CLOSEST ADVISORS, ALL THE WHILE PRAISING THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT FOR BEING TRANSPARENT IN HANDLING THIS VIRUS, INSTEAD OF DEMANDING ACCESS FOR THE CDC THAT BEIJING WAS REFUSING TO GIVE IN WUHAN. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SACRIFICE SO MUCH TO FIGHT THIS VIRUS. WE'VE LOST LIVES. WE'VE LOST BUSINESSES. WE'VE LOST PAYCHECKS. AND NOW THANKS TO DONALD TRUMP'S BUNGLING, WE MAY LOSE SOME OF THE PROGRESS WE'VE BEGUN TO MAKE, ALL BECAUSE HE'S LOST INTEREST. HE'S ONCE AGAIN IGNORING THE FACTS, THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE IS STILL WOEFULLY, WOEFULLY LACKING FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION. MORE THAN 117,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WITH AN AVERAGE DAILY NUMBER OF CASES STILL CLIMBING IN 21 STATES. WE STILL DON'T HAVE WHAT WE NEED WHEN IT COMES TO RAPID RESULTS TESTING, CONTACT TRACING CAPACITY, WIDELY AVAILABLE PERSONNEL, PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR THEM. , PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR THEM, OR CLEAR NATIONWIDE GUIDANCE. INSTEAD PRESIDENT TRUMP PUSHES DANGEROUS DISPROVEN DRUGS, STANDS IN THE WAY OF THE CDC ISSUES GUIDELINES ON REOPENING. THEY HAD THEM, WANTED TO ISSUE THEM, AND HE WOULDN'T LET THEM. HE REFUSES TO WEAR A MASK, BASIC TESTS OF LEADERSHIP. HE SCALED BACK MEETINGS ON THE COVID-19 TASK FORCE. I GUESS THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DO. IN SPITE OF EXPERTS SAYING THAT TESTING AND TRACING IS NECESSARY FOR REOPENING, HE SENT HIS TESTING CZAR HOME. THE MONEY PROVIDED TO THE PENTAGON FOR SENT MEDICAL SUPPLIES , THE MONEY PROVIDED TO THE PENTAGON FOR ESSENTIAL MEDICAL SUPPLIES, ONLY 15% HAS MADE IT OUT THE DOOR. DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO STYLE HIMSELF AS A WARTIME PRESIDENT AGAINST THIS INVISIBLE ENEMY, THE CORONAVIRUS, BUT UNLIKE ANY OTHER WARTIME LEADER, HE TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY. HE EXERCISES NO LEADERSHIP. NOW HE'S JUST FLAT SURRENDERING THE FIGHT, INSTEAD OF LEADING THE CHARGE TO DEFEAT THE VIRUS, HE JUST BASICALLY WAVED A WHITE FLAG AND HAS RETREATED. SO EAGER TO GET TO HIS CAMPAIGN RALLIES, THAT HE'LL PUT PEOPLE AT RISK AS EVERYONE HAS POINTED OUT, IN VIOLATION OF THE CDC GUIDELINES THAT STILL WARN AGAINST LARGE GATHERINGS AS LONG AS , HE'S READY TO DO IT, AS LONG AS, NOTWITHSTANDING CDC GUIDANCE, AS LONG AS THE PEOPLE SHOWING UP SIGN A WAIVER PROMISING THAT THEY WILL NOT HOLD THE CAMPAIGN LIABLE. OH, MAN. DONALD TRUMP'S FAILURE TO FIGHT THE CORONAVIRUS WITH THE SAME ENERGY AND FOCUS THAT HE USED TO TROLL HIS ENEMIES ON TWITTER HAS COST US LIVES AND IS PUTTING HOPE FOR AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY AT RISK. JOB NUMBERS AND RETAIL SALES WERE BETTER THAN EXPECTED IN MAY. THAT'S GREAT NEWS FOR THE COUNTRY. BUT NOW DONALD TRUMP'S DESIRE TO DECLARE VICTORY AND BE DONE WITH IT IS ONLY GOING TO IMPAIR THE CONTINUED PROGRESS WE HAVE TO MAKE. OUR ECONOMY IS STILL SPUTTERING, WITH MORE THAN 20 MILLION PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED AND NO CLEAR GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR WHAT BUSINESSES NEED TO DO TO REOPEN SAFELY, EFFICIENTLY, AND GENERATE A STRONG RECOVERY. THIS ISN'T A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER TO REOPEN. IT'S ABOUT HOW WE MAKE REOPENING WORK FOR EVERYONE. THE EMPLOYEES AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY GET DAILY COVID-19 TESTS. THEY KNOW THEY'RE SAFE BEFORE THEY GO TO WORK. THEY KNOW THEIR COWORKERS ARE SAFE. THEY HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO RESUME THEIR LIVES. WORKERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AREN'T ASKING FOR DAILY TESTING. THEY ARE JUST ASKING FOR REGULAR RELIABLE ACCESS TO TESTS. DON'T THEY DESERVE THAT? IT'S NOT THAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTING, IT'S THAT HE'S NOT UP TO THE TASK OR DOESN'T CARE, AND NOW HE'S SEEMINGLY DECIDED THAT HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO TRY. BUT JUST LIKE HE COULDN'T WISH COVID-19 AWAY IN MARCH, JUST LIKE HE COULDN'T TWEET IT AWAY IN APRIL, HE CAN'T IGNORE IT AWAY IN JUNE. SO I HAVE SOME BASIC QUESTIONS FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO MAKE SURE EVERY WORKER HAS ACCESS TO REGULAR TESTING SO THEY HAVE THE SAME CONFIDENCE TO GO INTO A STORE OR GO BACK TO WORK THAT WHITE HOUSE STAFFERS HAVE? SCHOOLS AND CHILD CARE CENTERS, NAVIGATING THE UNCERTAINTY ALL ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT EFFECTIVE GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO PROTECT THE KIDS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES? WHY DON'T YOU ENFORCE THE OSHA STANDARDS FOR WORKER PROTECTION DURING THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC? WHY DID THE MAINSTREAM LENDING PROGRAM CREATED MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AGO BY THE CONGRESS TO HELP STRUGGLING SMALL BUSINESSES ONLY OPEN FOR REGISTRATION TO LENDERS TWO DAYS AGO AND STILL HASN'T DISTRIBUTED A SINGLE PENNY? WHY DON'T YOU DISCLOSE THE NAMES, MR. PRESIDENT, OF THE BUSINESSES WHO RECEIVED THE TOTAL OF 500 BILLION DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER FUNDING? WHY ARE THEY BEING HIDDEN? HOW MANY CRONIES GOT BAILOUTS? HOW MANY DONORS? HOW MANY BIG BUSINESSES THAT DIDN'T NEED IT? WHAT BUSINESS HAD TO SHUT DOWN BECAUSE THEY WERE DENIED FUNDING IN APRIL? WHAT BUSINESSES DIDN'T GET SPECIAL APPROVAL THAT OTHERS GOT BY A NOD FROM THE TOP? WHY DID YOU GET RID OF THE WATCHDOG, MR. PRESIDENT? WHY DID YOU GET RID OF THE WATCHDOG, APPOINTED TO OVERSEE EVERY DOLLAR DISTRIBUTED, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, WHY DID YOU GET RID OF THAT PERSON THAT CONGRESS PASSED? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO HIDE? TO BAD MANAGEMENT ON TOP OF BAD PLANNING ON TOP OF NEGLECT. IT'S TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR A GREAT NATION LIKE OURS. FOLKS, HERE'S THE TRUTH, THE PANDEMIC IS STILL HERE. IT'S GOING TO BE HERE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, UNTIL WE GET IT UNDER CONTROL OR UNTIL WE HAVE SAFE AND PROVEN WIDELY AVAILABLE VACCINE. COVID-19 IS A FACT OF NATURE. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS VIRUS AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH IT. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT HEAD ON, HONESTLY. TELL THE PEOPLE THE TRUTH. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN HANDLE ANYTHING. JUST TELL THEM THE TRUTH. WE CAN'T DEAL WITH IT THE WAY YOU ARE DOING IT. THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH IT, MR. PRESIDENT, IF WE PUT IN THE WORK, INVESTING IN BUILDING A DYNAMIC RESILIENT ECONOMY AND HEALTH SYSTEM CAPABLE OF GETTING AND THEN STAYING HADE OF NEW OUTBREAKS. WE HAVE THE CAPACITY AND THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT. I'VE LAID OUT BASELINE STEPS OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FROM MAKE IT WORK CHECKLISTS, FOR SUCCESSFUL ACCOUNTABLE RECOVERY, THAT I PUT OUT BACK IN EARLY APRIL, TO THE STEPS OF A STRONG REOPENING THAT I RELEASED LAST WEEK. IT IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. GRANTED I HAVE INCREDIBLE SCIENTISTS ADVISING ME ON ALMOST A DAILY BASIS ON HOW TO PROCEED, BUT IT IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. IT IS COMMON SENSE. IT IS STRAIGHTFORWARD. THAT'S WHY THIS IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST INDICTMENT OF DONALD TRUMP'S COMPLETE COMPELLING LACK OF LEADERSHIP. HE WASTED MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS PASSING THE BUCK, BLAMING EVERYONE ELSE, REFUSING TO ACT WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARING OUR COUNTRY FOR A LONG-TERM RESPONSE AND BUILDING UP OUR RESILIENCY TO RESPOND TO FUTURE FLARE-UPS. YET, WE STILL DON'T HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING COVID-19 CASE DATA. THIS IS THE BASICS. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARING US TO WEATHER THE VALLEYS AND PEAKS OF THIS VIRUS. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING TO SHORE UP THE VULNERABILITIES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT HAVE BEEN LAID BARE IN THIS CRISIS AND HE'S TRYING TO ELIMINATE IN COURT. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING TO BRIDGE THE INEQUITIES AND STRENGTHEN THE CRACKS IN THE FOUNDATION, OF OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO EVERYONE TO SEE. HE HASN'T DONE ANY OF IT. BECAUSE OF THE DEPTHS OF DONALD TRUMP'S FAILURES, THIS PANDEMIC WILL CONTINUE TO BE WORSE FOR ALL AMERICANS AND MUCH WORSE FOR BLACK AND BROWN AMERICANS, WHO ARE GETTING HIT THE HARDEST. FOLKS IN COMMUNITIES LIKE , [INAUDIBLE] , DONALD TRUMP THINKS IF HE PUTS HIS HEAD IN THE SAND, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL TOO, BUT IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY, NOT WHEN HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE STILL DYING EVERY DAY AND MILLIONS ARE UNEMPLOYED WONDERING HOW IN GOD'S NAME THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND FOOD ON THE TABLE. NOT WHEN WORKERS ARE WEIGHED DOWN WITH WORRIES ABOUT THEIR SAFETY OR WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY GET SICK. THERE ARE STEPS WE NEED TO BE TAKING NOW TO STEER US STEADILY AND STRONGLY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, SEE US THROUGH THIS TIME, TO MAKE A MORE RESILIENT FUTURE. THEY ARE AVAILABLE. FIRST WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO AVOID DEADLY SPIKES IN INFECTIONS AS PEOPLE BEGIN TO GO BACK OUT INTO THE WORLD. WE'RE NOT THAT MUCH BETTER PREPARED TODAY WITH THE RUN OF CASES THAT OVERFILLS OUR INTENSIVE CARE UNITS THAN WE WERE THREE MONTHS AGO. SECOND, WE HAVE TO HELP GIVE PEOPLE THE ASSURANCE AND PRECAUTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO RESTART THE ECONOMY WITH CONFIDENCE. AND IF AMERICANS LOSE WHAT LITTLE FAITH THEY HAVE LEFT IN THE GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO MANAGE THIS PANDEMIC, WE'LL SEE MUCH DEEPER AND LONGER-LASTING ECONOMIC IMPACTS THAN WE EVEN , WITH EVEN GREATER REPERCUSSIONS FOR PEOPLE'S WELL BEINGS. MR. PRESIDENT, DON'T LEAVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO FACE THIS THREAT ON THEIR OWN, WITH NO GUIDANCE, RESOURCES, OR LEADERSHIP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. :: AND WORKERS NEED ASSURANCES THAT THEIR HEALTH IS YOUR FIRST CONCERN. AMERICANS NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL PUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST, NOT HIS OR HER OWN EGO. AMERICA NEEDS A PRESIDENT WHO WILL DO THE WORK READY ON DAY ONE AFTER MORE THAN THREE YEARS IN OFFICE WHY ISN'T DONALD TRUMP READY? MR. PRESIDENT, WAKE UP. GET TO WORK. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO BE DONE.

WITNESSES INCLUDE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE MEMBERS DR. STEPHEN HAHN, DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, AND DR. ROBERT REDFIELD. LIVE COVERAGE BEGINS AT 10:00 EASTERN ON C-SPAN THREE, ONLINE AT C-SPAN.ORG, OR THIS AND ON THE FREE C-SPAN RADIO APP. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN, WITH FAMILIES IN PENNSYLVANIA, YOU TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. HE SPOKE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF WIDESPREAD TESTING FOR CORONAVIRUS WHEN REOPENING THE ECONOMY. 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IF THE PRESIDENT WINS THIS CASE, HE KEEPS SAYING HE IS GOING TO COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, BUT HE HAS NOT FIGURED OUT ANYWAY THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DO THAT. ABSENT WHAT WE HAVE DONE. AND THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT LATER, IF I'M ELECTED, I HAVE A PLAN TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND ACCESS TO MEDICARE, AS WELL AS MEDICAID, OR SO MANY FOLKS. A LOT IS GOING ON BUT I DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU ALL , FIRE AWAY, TELL ME ABOUT , THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. I AM THE MOM OF A FOUR YEAR OLD SON. HE COULDN'T COME TODAY, BUT THIS IS A PICTURE OF HIM. HE LOVES SUPERHEROES AND STAR WARS AND ANYTHING OUTSIDE, HE IS A TYPICAL FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY, BUT UNDERNEATH ALL THAT, HE HAS A LOT OF MEDICAL ISSUES GOING ON. HE HAS A DISEASE CALLED MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE. THAT AFFECTS BASICALLY EVERY CELL IN THE BODY. HE GOES THROUGH A LOT. HE HAS SPENT HALF HIS LIFE IN THE HOSPITAL. WE HAVE 30 SPECIALISTS THAT WE SEE BETWEEN LEE. HE HAS FOUR THERAPISTS WE ARE SEEING ALL THE TIME AND ABOUT TO ADD MORE TO HIS REGIMEN. THINGS CHANGE FOR HIM DAILY SOMETIMES. I ECHO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE SHARED, WHEN HE WAS FIRST BORN AND STARTED HAVING ISSUES, I HAD MY OWN INSURANCE. SOMETIMES, WE WERE SPENDING $3500 A MONTH OUT OF POCKET ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. HE IS ON SOMETHING CALLED TPN, WHICH FEEDS INTO HIS HEART. HE HAS A PERMANENT LINE THAT GOES INTO HIS CHEST, INTO HIS HEART. THEY CREATE A SOLUTION FOR HIM EVERY WEEK THAT HAS TO VITAMINS AND MINERALS, NUTRIENTS, FLUIDS THAT HE NEEDS, THAT IS HOW HE IS FED, THROUGH THAT CENTRAL LINE. THAT CAUSED IT OVER $80,000 A MONTH JUST FOR THAT ALONE, ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. THANKS TO ACA, HE WAS ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID BECAUSE WE WERE VERY CLOSE TO HAVING TO LOOK AT BANKRUPTCY. WE WERE USING CREDIT CARDS, WE WERE HAVING TO MAKE THE DECISION, DO WE PAY THE ELECTRIC BILL OR BY HIS MEDICATION? SO MANY OF HIS MEDICATIONS ARE ALSO VERY EXPENSIVE. ANOTHER THING THAT THE ACA HAS AFFORDED US IS HOME CARE NURSING. THAT IS SOMETHING PRIVATE INSURANCE IS NOT PAY FOR. HE REQUIRES HOSPITAL-LEVEL CARE EVERY DAY AND BECAUSE OF THAT, BECAUSE OF ACA, HE IS ABLE TO BE HOME WITH NURSES IN HIS COMMUNITY, PART OF EVERYDAY LIFE , INSTEAD OF BEING IN A HOSPITAL. THAT MEANS THE WORLD TO US. QUALITY OF LIFE IS EVERYTHING. HE HAS SOME ANY OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD OF HIM AND BECAUSE OF ACA, HE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THROUGH. ANOTHER CONCERN, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HE IS 26? THESE ARE THE FEARS WE HAVE AS FAMILIES MOVING FORWARD THROUGH THIS. THE PRESIDENT IS PROPOSING CUTTING MEDICARE BY $700 BILLION. IN ADDITION TO THE FORMAL CARE ACT. THERE IS SO MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR SITUATION COME UP WITH A RARE DISEASE, SO MANY PEOPLE WITH SIMILAR KINDS OF NEEDS. THE COSTS ARE JUST BEYOND CAPACITY FOR ANYONE TO HANDLE UNLESS YOU ARE A MULTIMILLIONAIRE. BY THE WAY, BOBBY SAYS HELLO. I WAS JUST TALKING TO HIM. HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING? MY NAME IS STACY. THIS IS ONE OF MY TWINS, JAN. JAN IS 22. WHEN JAN AND HER IDENTICAL TWIN SISTER MADELINE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WHEN THEY WERE FOUR, WHICH REQUIRED STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS, WHICH THEY HAVE AT THE HOSPITAL IN PITTSBURGH , CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA, THEIR PROCEDURE, THE STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS, IT ISN'T READILY INSPECTED , INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. THIS IS BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. LET ME CORRECT THAT, THE PATIENT PROTECTION. WE DID HIT A ONE MILLION-DOLLAR CAP ON OUR EMPLOYER-BASED COVERAGE. WE FORTUNATELY, AND UNFORTUNATELY, WERE ABLE TO , WE HAVE FOUR CHILDREN, THE TWINS ARE OUR OLDEST. I HAD A TODDLER AND I WAS PREGNANT WITH MY FOURTH WHEN WE FOUND OUT THIS IS CANCER. MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO TAKE FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE IN ORDER TO HELP. WE WOULD GO BACK AND FORTH AND TAGTEAM STAYING AT THE HOSPITAL AND SEE THEM TAKING CARE OF MY SON. THERE WAS NO INCOME COMING IN BECAUSE IT IS UNPAID. WE KEPT THE COVERAGE BUT IT WAS EXPENSIVE. WHEN YOU HAVE NOTHING COMING IN AND EVERYTHING GOING OUT, WE ENDED UP FILING BANKRUPTCY. FORTUNATELY, THEY WERE ABLE TO GO ON TO KATE AS A SECONDARY THROUGH THE STATE, WHICH DID HELP PICK UP SOME THINGS, BUT WE DID NOT SIGN UP FOR THAT UNTIL AFTER WE HAD , WENT BANKRUPT. NOT ONLY IS THE PATIENT PROTECTION SO IMPORTANT TO ME FOR MY KIDS, FOR THE PATIENT PROTECTIONS, BUT ONE OF THE REASONS I VOTED FOR YOU AND PRESIDENT OBAMA BACK INTO THOUSAND SEVEN , IN 2007 IS BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO WATCH YOUR MOM , MY MOM DIED AT CANCER AT 52. SHE PUT OFF GOING FOR CARE BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T AFFORD IT. SHE WAS OLD SCHOOL, SHE WAS GOING TO WAIT AND GO WHEN SHE COULD UP FORD , AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT. SHE WAS PAYING OFF A PREVIOUS MEDICAL ISSUE, SO SHE WAS WAITING TO PAY THAT OFF AND BY THE TIME SHE WENT, IT WAS TOO LATE, THE CANCER SPREAD AND SHE PASSED AWAY. I KNEW AFTER READING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN THAT HE GOT IT BECAUSE OF HIS MOM, AND I KNEW IN MY HEART THAT YOU WOULD BOTH SEE THIS THROUGH AND YOU DID AND HERE WE ARE. HERE WE ARE, WE COULDN'T SAVE MY MOM, BUT WE CAN HELP OUR CHILDREN BY NOT DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THEM AND MAKING SURE THEY CAN STAY ON OUR INSURANCE UNTIL THEY ARE 26. JAN HAD TO LEAVE COLLEGE FOR SOME HEALTH ISSUES AND HAS NOW GONE BACK AT 22 TO CONTINUE A DEGREE IN EDUCATION. 26, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE THAT THROUGH. COVERAGE FOR THE CHRONIC CARE. MY KIDS WERE ONLY TWO OF OVER 15,000 KIDS A YEAR DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER. ONLY TWO OF OVER 400,000 CHILDHOOD CANCER SURVIVORS IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE IS 400,000 CHILDREN WITH THE EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IS JUST CANCER. THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE JUVENILE DIABETES OR WHAT YOUR SON HAS, THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. HOW CAN WE, IN GOOD CONSCIENCE, TAKE THAT AWAY FROM OUR CHILDREN? I JUST DON'T GET IT. WELL, I DON'T GET IT EITHER. THE FACT IS THAT, YOU KNOW, I , THE CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT , THE REASON WE , EVERYBODY FORGETS WHY WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO STAY ON THEIR PARENTS' POLICY UNTIL 26 IS BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, A WHOLE GENERATION LOST ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS, ACCESS TO INSURANCE, IT MADE A GIGANTIC DIFFERENCE FOR PEOPLE. THE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS MADE A GIGANTIC DIFFERENCE. ALSO, BEING ABLE TO AFFORD TO GET BASIC COVERAGE. I LOST BOTH MY PARENTS AT HOME AND THEY WERE EACH LIVED WITH ME THE LAST PART OF THEIR LIVES AND MY WIFE LOST BOTH OF HER PARENTS AT HOME AS WELL. WHAT I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IS THAT FOR THE SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE POPULATION, THERE IS NOTHING LIKE WATCHING YOUR CHILD BE IN DISTRESS. I GOT ELECTED, I AM PROBABLY THE ONLY PERSON WHO GOT SWORN IN IN A HOSPITAL WITH MY TWO SONS AFTER MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE HAD I NOT HAD INSURANCE AT THE TIME. THIS IS BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THEN, MY SON CAME HOME, ONE LITTLE BOY GREW UP TO BE , THEY HAVE BOTH GROWN, ONE OF THEM BECAME THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF DELAWARE, A POOR HERO, DECORATED, COMING HOME FROM A YEAR AFTER BEING IN IRAQ AND STATES FOR GLIOBLASTOMA, MONTHS TO LIVE, WHETHER YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BEGET, JUST HOW LONG. I USED TO SIT THERE AND THINK, THIS IS GOD'S TRUTH, WONDER, WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD SHE MADE IT FOR 17 MONTHS IN REAL PAIN? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY HAD COME WITH SIX MONTHS LEFT TO GO AND SAID, SUFFER IN PEACE, YOU HAVE OUTLIVED YOUR COVERAGE? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE. NOT JUST WHAT IT DOES TO THE PATIENT, BUT TO THE PARENTS. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT, I APPRECIATE YOU ALL BEING HERE, SO THAT WE CAN , THERE ARE MILLIONS OF YOU AROUND THE COUNTRY IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. I THINK THAT IT GETS LOST, THE PERSONAL PIECE OF THIS GETS LOST IN THIS DEBATE. THIS IS ABOUT ONE DAY AT A TIME. WHAT I DID WHEN MY SON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER, I HAD BEEN VICE PRESIDENT, I VISITED EVERY MAJOR CANCER FACILITY IN THE WORLD, NOT ONLY THE UNITED STATES, SET UP A MAJOR CANCER FOUNDATION, THE PRESIDENT SET UP A THING CALLED DEALING WITH MY ABILITY TO DO A LOT OF RESEARCH IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON HOW WE DEAL WITH CANCER. THEN WHEN I LEFT 21 CANCER HOSPITALS AS WELL AS A TOTAL OF NINE NOBEL LAUREATE WHO WANTED ME TO CONTINUE WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING DURING THE ADMINISTRATION, IT REALLY MATTERS TO PEOPLE. CHOP IS A GREAT HOSPITAL. MY DAUGHTER WASN'T CHOP, THEY DIAGNOSED EARLY ON, ANY PROBLEMS SHE HAD, A HIP DISPLACER WHEN SHE WAS AN INFANT. HAD A NOT COT IT, JUST NOT CAUGHT IT , HAD THEY NOT CAUGHT IT, SHE WOULD HAVE ONE LEG LONGER THAN THE OTHER. THERE IS A LOT OF GREAT DOCTORS OUT THERE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE NOT AS A PRIVILEGE BUT AS A BASIC RIGHT THAT EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO. I'M NOT 20 TAKE YOU THROUGH HOW I'M GOING TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE, BUT I WILL TAKE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND I BELIEVE WE CAN GET IT PASSED, ADDING A PUBLIC AUCTION, A MEDICARE OPTION TO THAT, AND INCREASE THE ASCUS , THE ACCESS TO OTHER MEANS OF HEALTH CARE THAT ARE AVAILABLE. YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE TO BE ABLE TO GET ANY KIND OF MEDICARE COVERAGE AT HOME, MEDICAID. THERE IS A LOT WE CAN DO AND I THINK THE PUBLIC IS READY TO DO IT. WHAT I WANT TO THANK U IS FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO COME IN AND TALK ABOUT IT TO ALLOW US TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK. WE ARE IN COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, YOU TALKED ABOUT COBRA. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS AND ALTHOUGH THEY TECHNICALLY ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PAY INTO COBRA, THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYERS OUT OF BUSINESS. THEY CAN'T PAY AT. , PAY IT. THAT IS WHY I PROPOSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKE UP THAT COBRA PAYMENT SO EVERYBODY CAN KEEP WHAT THEY HAD NEGOTIATED, WHETHER THEY HAVE A JOB OR NOT. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FRIGHTENED AND ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO , I'M SUPPOSEDLY A EXPERT IN FOREIGN POLICY, HEALTH CARE IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN FOREIGN POLICY. IT REALLY IS. THINK OF ALL THE BRIGHT PEOPLE LIKE YOU FROM PHD'S TO THE GUY WHO WAS BREAKING HIS NECK MAKING SURE THAT WE KEEP THE ROADS OPEN , WHEN THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO SIGN UP, THEY CAN RE-UP THEIR INSURANCE, THOSE CHOICES, WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? IT IS COMPLICATED STUFF. IN ONE SENSE, IT SIMPLE. THE IDEA THAT A FAMILY SHOULD HAVE TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY, THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY SHOULD BE IN A POSITION WHERE THEIR CHILD IS NOT ABLE TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED IS JUST THE ULTIMATE DEPRIVATION. MY DAD USED TO SAY, YOU , YOUR JOB IS ABOUT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK, IT IS BETTER PLACE IN A COMMUNITY. HOW CAN A PARENT MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNITY WHEN THEY LOOK AT THEIR CHILD AND REALIZE THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO HELP THEM? THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO, IF GOD FOR BID, THE COURT MAKES A RULING, THAT WE CAN PASS A BEEFED UP ELEMENT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE REALIZING WHAT IT MEANS AND THINK ABOUT IT. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOST SEQUENTIAL HEALTH CRISIS IN AMERICAN HISTORY SINCE 1918, WE ARE CUTTING ACCESS TO INSURANCE? WHILE SO MANY BUSINESSES RUN OUT OF BUSINESS AND ARE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE IT ON BUSINESS HEALTH INSURANCE THAT THEY HAVE? IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE CLOSE TO CRUEL.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?473396-4\/joe-biden-roundtable-health-care","Summary":"Former Vice President Joe Biden, the 2020 presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, spoke in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, about the Affordable Care Act and his plan to make it available to every American.","Source":"473396-4","Type":"Speech"}

A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FRIGHTENED AND WHEN I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO SUPPOSEDLY AM AN EXPERT IN FOREIGN POLICY THAT HEALTHCARE IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN FOREIGN-POLICY. THINK ABOUT THE BRIGHT PEOPLE WITH PHD'S TO THE GUY WHO BREAKS HIS NECK TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE ROADS OPEN AND TO HAVE A CHANCE TO SIGN UP AND THEN THEY CAN WE UP INSURANCE. SO IT IS COMPLICATED STAFF. THE IDEA THAT OUR FAMILY SHOULD HAVE TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY AND THE IDEA AND THAT A CHILD IT IS JUST THE ULTIMATE DEPRIVATION. MY DAD USED TO SAY, JOE YOUR DAD IS MORE THAN A PAYCHECK BUT DIGNITY AND RESPECT IN PLACE IN A COMMUNITY HOW CAN A PARENT MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNITY TO REALIZE THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO HELP A CHILD? SO I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN PASS THE BEEFED-UP ELEMENT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS BECAUSE IN THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL HEALTH CRISIS SINCE 1918 GETTING ACCESS TO INSURANCE WHILE SO MANY BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN HEALTH INSURANCE GOOD AFTERNOON. TODAY WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS AND DONALD TRUMP WILL FILE IN THE SUPREME COURT TO STRIP AWAY HEALTHCARE COVERAGE FROM TENS OF MILLIONS OF FAMILIES IN THE UNITED STATES. IN 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS IF HE SUCCEEDS MORE THAN 23 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE COVERAGE OVERNIGHT INCLUDING 1 MILLION IN PENNSYLVANIA. INSURANCE ONCE AGAIN DISCRIMINATE SERVICES ARE DROP COVERAGE FOR PEOPLE LIKE DIABETES OR CANCER OR ASTHMA MOST CRUELLY OF ALL DONALD TRUMP IF HE HAS HIS WAY THOSE WHO HAVE COMPLICATIONS FROM COVE IN 18 IS THE NEW PRE-EXISTING CONDITION LIKE LONG SCARS OR HEART DAMAGE AND IF DONALD TRUMP PREVAILS IN COURT AND TO STRIP AWAY COVERAGE JACK UP PREMIUM SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY SURVIVED FIGHTING CORONAVIRUS THOSE HAVING STRUGGLED WINNING THE FIGHT OF THEIR LIVES WOULD HAVE THEIR PIECE OF MINE STOLE AND AT THE MOMENT THEY NEEDED IT THE MOST THEY WOULD LIVE THEIR LIVES, AND ADVICE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP'S LEGACY AND FAILURE TO PREVENT ON - - PROTECT AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THE CORONAVIRUS AND THIS CRUSADE TO TAKE HEALTHCARE PROTECTIONS AWAY FROM AMERICAN FAMILIES. I HAVE CALLED ON DONALD TRUMP MANY TIMES TO WITHDRAW HIS LAWSUIT IN TODAY I AM RENEWING THAT CALL. DROPPED THE LAWSUIT. STOPPED TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. STOP TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S HEALTHCARE AND PEACE OF MIND. NOW MORE THAN EVER STOP TRYING TO STEAL THEIR PIECE OF MIND I CANNOT COMPREHEND THE CRUELTY TO INFLICT THOSE PEOPLE HE IS SUPPOSED TO SERVE. ONE OF THE FAMILIES OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHO LIVE NOT FAR FROM HERE IN MANNHEIM PENNSYLVANIA JUST FOUR YEARS OLD WHEN THEIR MOM STACY HEARD THE MOST DEVASTATING WORDS A PARENT CAN HERE. THOSE OF THE TWINS WERE DIAGNOSED WITH LEUKEMIA. I PROMISE STOPS YOUR HEART. AND KNOX THE ENTIRE WORLD OFFICE ACCESS ON - - AXIS IN THE VERY LAST THING ON YOUR MIND THE VERY LAST THING ON YOUR MIND THAT SHOULD BE ON YOUR MIND IF YOU CAN AFFORD TREATMENT FOR YOUR CHILDREN. WHEN STACY'S TWINS GOT SICK THERE WAS NO AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AFTER STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS AND THE WAVES OF HOPE AND FEAR AND AFTER ENDURING MORE THAN ANY AND PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO ENDURE SHE STILL FACED A FUTURE WHERE THE TWINS COULD BE DENIED COVERAGE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS CREATED TO PUT A STOP TO THAT TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE STACY TO FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS AND SAVE THEIR CHILDREN THEY WON THE FIGHT THEY BE CANCER NOW THEY ARE 22 YEARS OF AGE STUDYING EDUCATION AND THEN GRADUATING FROM ARCADIA UNIVERSITY AND BECAUSE OF THE ACA INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN NO LONGER DENIED COVERAGE BECAUSE THEY ARE SURVIVORS OF CANCER. I AM PROUD OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IN ADDITION TO HELPING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THIS IS A LAW VITAL COVERAGE FOR 25 MILLION AMERICANS THAT BARS INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM TAPPING AMERICAN BENEFITS AND CHARGING WOMEN MORE FOR INSURANCE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMAN FOR NEARLY 12 MILLION SENIORS. TO SEE THE COST SPIKE BECAUSE OF THE MEDICARE DON'T HOLD WOULD SUDDENLY REOPEN AND THE COST HAS GONE PRECIPITOUSLY THIS SAVES LIVES BUT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN MODERN HISTORY SINCE THE PANDEMIC OF 1918, DONALD TRUMP IS SUING TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE. IT'S CRUEL, HEARTLESS, CALLOUS BECAUSE HE CANNOT ABIDE THE THOUGHT LETTING ONE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE HAVE SEEN THAT SAME CALLOUSNESS OF THE CORONAVIRUS JUST OVER THREE MONTHS AGO AS MOST AMERICANS WERE FIRST COMING TO GRIPS WITH THE UNPRECEDENTED SCALE OF DANGER AND PANDEMIC PRESIDENT TRUMP PUBLICLY CLAIMED \"ANYBODY THAT ONCE A TEST ANYBODY CAN GET IT. THAT SIMPLY WAS NOT TRUE AND HE KNEW IT AND THEN FIVE DAYS AGO AT THE CAMPAIGN RALLY AND ALSO OKLAHOMA HE ADMITTED TELLING PEOPLE SLOW THE TESTING DOWN PLEASE. HIS ONE HOUR 50 MINUTES SPEECH. SLOWED THE TESTING DOWN, PLEASE. THE FIRST THE SPOKESPEOPLE TRIED TO SAY HE WAS JOKING BUT THEN HE SAID HE WASN'T. HE CALLED IT \"A DOUBLE EDGE SWORD. THAT IS THE QUOTE. LET'S BE CRYSTAL CLEAR WHAT HE MEANS BY THAT. QUESTING UNEQUIVOCABLY SAVES LIVES WIDESPREAD TESTING IS THE KEY TO BUILD OUR ECONOMY AGAIN. THE OTHER EDGE THAT THEY THINK THAT FINDING OUT MORE AMERICANS ARE SICK WILL MAKE HIM LOOK BAD. THAT'S WHAT HE'S WORRIED ABOUT. HE'S WORRIED ABOUT LOOKING BAD DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO STOP WORRYING ABOUT HOW HE LOOKS AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE REST OF AMERICA INCREASING IN 29 STATES DEALING WITH THIS FOR A LONG TIME TRUMP CANNOT WISH IT AWAY HE CANNOT SPEND THAT TO MEET HIS POLITICAL WISHES THERE ARE NO MIRACLES COMING WE WILL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR THIS BECAUSE NONE IS COMING WE HAVE TO STEP UP AS AMERICANS ALL OF US AND DO THE SIMPLE THINGS IN THE HARD THINGS TO KEEP OUR FAMILIES SAFE TO REOPEN THE ECONOMY AND EVENTUALLY PUT THE PANDEMIC BEHIND US AND DO THIS WITHOUT RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S UP TO ALL OF US. WE HAVE TO WEAR MASKS MINUS OFF BECAUSE SOCIALLY DISTANT STAND IN FRONT OF A MICROPHONE I WEAR IT EVERYWHERE I GO. AND I KNOW AS AMERICANS IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE ARE USED TO BUT IT MATTERS ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT TELLS US IT COULD BE THE SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE THING WE CAN DO WE HAVE TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE LIKE WE ARE HERE TODAY IT SEEMS SO STRANGE TO US NOT AS AMERICANS BUT HUMAN BEINGS. WE ARE TAUGHT TO GATHER IT HARD AGAIN LAUGH WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT FOR NOW WE HAVE TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE IT MATTERS. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP OUR ECONOMY RUNNING TO BRING A NUMBER OF CASES DOWN. THE PRESIDENT WANTS US TO BELIEVE THERE IS A CHOICE BETWEEN THE ECONOMY OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AMAZINGLY HE STILL HAS NOT GRASPED THE MOST BASIC FACT OF THE CRISIS TO FIX THE ECONOMY WE HAVE TO GET CONTROL OVER THE VIRUS. SAY IT AGAIN. TO FIX THE ECONOMY WE HAVE TO GET CONTROL OVER THE VIRUS. LIKE A CHILD HE CANNOT BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENED TO HIM. ALL OF HIS WHINING AND SELF-PITY SELF-PITY, THIS PANDEMIC DID NOT HAPPEN TO HIM. WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF US HIS JOB ISN'T TO WHINE ABOUT IT BUT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND TO LEAD. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO HER ON - - EASE THE BURDEN AND PUT YOUR FAMILY FIRST THAT WOULD BEGIN WITH A DRAMATIC EXPANSION OF HEALTH COVERAGE WITH BOLD STEPS TO LOWER HEALTH CARE COST WE NEED A PUBLIC OPTION NOW MORE THAN EVER ESPECIALLY WHEN MORE THAN 20 MILLION PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED THAT ALLOWS EVERY AMERICAN REGARDLESS OF EMPLOYMENT STATUS THE CHOICE TO GET A MEDICARE -LIKE PLAN TO FORCE PRIVATE INSURERS TO KEEP PAYMENTS LOW OFFER BETTER COVERAGE BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME HAVE TO COMPETE FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE A PROFIT WE WILL LOWER PREMIUMS FOR PEOPLE BUYING COVERAGE ON THE ROUND KNOW AMERICAN HAS TO SPEND MORE THAN EIGHT.5 PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON HEALTH INSURANCE. ALL THE DETAILS ARE LAID OUT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WE WILL ALSO FURTHER REDUCE COST TO MAKE IT LESS EXPENSIVE TO HAVE LOWER DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES IN THE PRACTICE OF SO-CALLED SURPRISE BILLING LEAVING WITH UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH BILLS AFTER YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE MY PLAN LOWERS HEALTHCARE COST JUST AS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE QUICKLY WHEN IT IS NEEDED NOW. ENDURING ILLNESS AND RISKY CHOICES LOSING THE EMPLOYER'S PLAN AS THE EMPLOYER'S GO OUT OF BUSINESS. AND NEED LIFELINES NOW. THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES DESERVE. THEY DON'T NEED A PRESIDENT TO GO INTO COURT TO DENY THEM THE HEALTHCARE THEY HAD. AND ALSO YOU NEED A PRESIDENT THAT WILL FIGHT LIKE HELL TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THE HEALTHCARE THEY NEED. I LOOK FORWARD TO ENDING IT FOR HIM AND WORK QUICKLY WITH CONGRESS TO ME BUT PROTECTIONS OF LOWER HEALTHCARE COST AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. THIS IS MY PROMISE I'M PRESIDENT I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THE SAME WAY I WILL MY OWN. THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME AND MY WIFE JILL. I WAS SWORN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, NEXT TO A HOSPITAL BED MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE JUST KILLED IN A CAR CRASH LYING IN THAT BED WITH MY TWO YOUNG BOYS BOYS, SURVIVING BOYS. I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE HEALTHCARE, HEALTHCARE WE NEEDED IMMEDIATELY. FOUR YEARS LATER, 40 YEARS LATER MY GROWN SON AFTER THE IT ATTORNEY GENERAL COMING BACK AND THEN CONTRACTED FATAL CANCER. AND THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG HE WOULD HAVE TO LIVE, HOW MANY MONTHS. SITTING IN THE HOSPITAL JILL AND HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN FOR HIS HANDS. AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD WHAT IN THE HELL WOULD I DO IF THE INSURANCE COMPANY COULD DO BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE ACT TO SAY YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF TIME YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF YOUR COVERAGE EXCEPT FOR THOSE LESS PAINFUL MONTHS DYING ON YOUR OWN OWN. AND SUFFER IN PEACE I CANNOT FATHOM. I CANNOT FATHOM HAVING TO GO THROUGH THAT. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO MANY FAMILIES BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. SO AMY, I UNDERSTAND WHEN I SAY I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THE SAME WAY TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY. NOTHING AND TAKE MORE SERIOUSLY THAT IS MY PROMISE TO STACY AND VICTORIA AND AMY AND OTHER AMERICANS THAT IS WHAT THE PRESIDENCY IS. IT IS A DUTY TO CARE. A DUTY TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. , ALL OF US. NO TRUST IS MORE SACRED NO PURPOSE MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAN A PRESIDENT TO DO ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THEY CAN DO TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES. I WANT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN TO NOW IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING OR WORRIED ABOUT HOW YOU GET TO THE DAY, I WILL NOT ABANDON YOU I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU TO FACE THESE CHALLENGES ALONE AND WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. WE WILL BUILD A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE'LL BUILD ON IT AND BUILD THE ECONOMY AND THE COUNTRY BACK TO BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE THEY GOT OFF CRISIS. THAT I PROMISE YOU. LET ME AND BY THINKING THE FAMILIES THERE ARE SO MANY LIKE YOURS ACROSS AMERICA. I GET IT. THERE IS REAL SOLIDARITY. WE WILL GET THIS DONE I PROMISE. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?473396-1\/joe-biden-remarks-health-care","Summary":"Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, spoke in Lancaster, Pennsylvania about the Affordable Care Act and his plan to make it available to every American. He expressed his concern that if President Trump has his way, complications from COVID-19 could become a new pre-existing condition, thus leaving American families without health care protection. He also told the audience that testing saves lives and widespread testing is the key to opening the economy again. Mr. Biden did not take any audience questions.","Source":"473396-1","Type":"Speech"}

AND WE WILL DISCUSS POLICY ISSUES THAT IMPACT YOU. COMING UP WEDNESDAY MORNING, MICHIGAN DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBY DINGLE WILL JOIN US. SHE TALKS ABOUT THE LATEST U.S. RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES WITH CONGRESSMAN LARRY BUSHONG, WHO IS ALSO A MEDICAL DOCTOR, ON HIS LEGISLATION TO INCREASE TESTING. WATCH C-SPAN'S \"WASHINGTON JOURNAL,\" AT 7:00 A.M. EASTERN WEDNESDAY MORNING, AND JOIN THE DISCUSSION WITH YOUR PHONE CALLS, FACEBOOK THOMAS, TEXT MESSAGES, AND TWEETS. NEXT, JOE BIDEN TALKS ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC AND LAYS OUT HIS UPDATED PLANS FOR REOPENING THE ECONOMY. THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT ALSO ANSWERED QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES AND THE REMOVAL OF CONFEDERATE STATUES AND OTHER MONUMENTS. FROM WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, THIS IS 50 MINUTES. I'M A FEW MINUTES LATE. THIS IS MY POLLING PLACE. I WAS TRYING TO VOTE EARLY, BUT I COULDN'T FIND IT. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. I CAN'T TELL WHETHER YOU'RE SMILING OR NOT, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. I WANT TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING RIGHT NOW, AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. FOR WEEKS, WE HAVE SEEN THE WARNING SIGNS. NUMBERS DON'T LIE. INFECTION RATES ARE NOW GOING UP IN MORE STATES THAN THEY ARE GOING DOWN. MORE THAN 125,000 PEOPLE IN THE U.S. HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES. AND THOSE NUMBERS AND NEW INFECTIONS CONTINUE TO GROW AT ALARMING RATES. ONCE AGAIN, IT IS CONFRONTING THE SIMPLE FACT THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS WITHOUT A RIGOROUS PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH. THEY ARE NOT SEPARABLE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPAGANDA THAT THE RESPONSE SHOULD BE A CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION, AND DESPITE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REQUEST THAT WE SHOULD SLOW DOWN TESTING BECAUSE HE THINKS IT MAKES HIM LOOK BAD, THE COVID-19 IS STILL HERE. THE DAILY THREAT TO AMERICAN HEALTH AND PROSPERITY IS CONTINUING. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. MONTH AFTER MONTH, AS OTHER LEADERS IN OTHER COUNTRIES TOOK THE NECESSARY STEPS TO GET THE VIRUS UNDER CONTROL, DONALD TRUMP FAILED US. MONTH AFTER MONTH, AS MANY OF US ARE URGED HIM TO STEP UP AND DO HIS JOB, HE FAILED US. JUST LOOK AT THE RECORD. IN JANUARY, I, ALONG WITH OTHERS, SOUNDED THE ALARM OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK. TRUMP TOLD THE COUNTRY COVID-19 IS \"TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL, AND EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT WELL.\" IN FEBRUARY, I WARNED ABOUT THE FAILURE OF INFORMATION THAT WE NEEDED FROM THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. WHAT I SAID WAS THE PRESIDENT SHOULD DEMAND XI PRODUCE THE EVIDENCE, DEMAND IT. TRUMP SAID \"WE ARE IN GREAT SHAPE.\" CHINA'S PRESIDENT SAID IT WAS \"DOING VERY WELL.\" IN MARCH, I SET FORTH A DETAILED PLAN FOR 500 FEDERALLY FUNDED TESTING SITES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AS WELL AS GUARANTEED EMERGENCY PAID LEAVE. LATER THAT MONTH, I CALLED FOR FULL AND IMMEDIATE USE OF THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT, CRITICAL FOR DELIVERING SUPPLIES TO THOSE WHERE IT WAS NEEDED. TRUMP ACCUSED HEALTH-CARE WORKERS OF STEALING A MASK. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. HEALTH-CARE WORKERS ARE STEALING THE MASKS. THAT'S WHY WE DON'T HAVE THEM. IN APRIL, I RELEASED A PLAN TO SECURE THE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. SURGE NATIONWIDE TESTING WITH A TWO WAY PANDEMIC TESTING BOARD, AND LAUNCHED A NATIONWIDE HEALTH CORE TO FOCUS ON CONTACT TRACING. TRUMP SUGGESTED AMERICANS SHOULD INJECT DISINFECTANTS INTO THEIR BODIES. IN MAY, I CONDEMNED THE CHOICE BETWEEN PRESERVING PUBLIC HEALTH AND OUR ECONOMY. I URGED THE ADMINISTRATION TO FOCUS ON THE BASIC PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES, LIKE TESTING, TO ENABLE US TO SUSTAIN ECONOMIC RECOVERY. TRUMP'S RESPONSE, HE PUSHED FOR REOPENING WITHOUT REGARD TO SAFETY, AND CALLED TESTING \"FRANKLY OVERRATED.\" THIS MONTH, I OUTLINED A PATH TO REOPEN OUR COUNTRY SAFELY AND SUSTAINABLY. PROVIDE WORKERS, SMALL BUSINESSES, SCHOOLS, STATES, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, THE RESOURCES AND GUIDANCE THEY WOULD NEED. TRUMP'S PROPOSAL? HE SAID A CUTOFF DATE FOR FEDERAL FUNDING AND TESTING SITES IN SEVERAL STATES. HE ACTUALLY WENT TO COURT TO TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE FOR 22 MILLION PEOPLE BY TRYING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE. AND NOW, DONALD TRUMP IS IN RETREAT. BACK IN MARCH, WHEN I CALLED, AND HE CALLED, TO TALK ABOUT THE NEEDS, ACTING LIKE WE WERE AT WAR WITH THE VIRUS. HE CALLED HIMSELF A WARTIME PRESIDENT. REMEMBER WHEN HE EXERTED THE NATIONS ARE SACRIFICED TOGETHER AND \"IN THE FACE OF THIS INEVITABLE AND INVISIBLE ENEMY.\" WHAT HAPPENED? NOW, IT'S ALMOST JULY. IT SEEMS LIKE OUR WARTIME PRESIDENT HAS SURRENDERED. WAVED THE WHITE FLAG AND LEFT THE BATTLEFIELD. TODAY, WE ARE FACING A SERIOUS THREAT. WE HAVE TO MEET IT. WE HAVE TO MEET IT AS ONE COUNTRY. BUT THE PRESIDENT GIVES NO DIRECTION. HE PUTS US AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. WE CAN'T CONTINUE LIKE THIS. HALF RECOVERING AND HALF GETTING WORSE. WE CAN'T CONTINUE. HALF WEARING MASKS, AND HALF REJECTING SCIENCE. WE CAN'T CONTINUE. HALF WITH A PLAN AND HALF JUST HOPING FOR THE BEST. WE WON'T DEFEAT THIS VIRUS WITH A PIECEMEAL APPROACH. LIFTING RESTRICTIONS PREMATURELY , INCREASING THE VOLATILITY OF THE CRISIS. RAISING THE LIKELIHOOD OF NEEDING TO REIMPOSE RESTRICTIONS. UNTIL OUR SCIENCE CATCHES UP WITH REALITY, UNTIL WE HAVE BETTER TREATMENT FOR THOSE WHO BECOME INFECTED IN NOT ONLY OUR STATE WITH PROVEN, WIDELY AVAILABLE VACCINES, WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO ALL WE CAN TODAY I'M RELEASING THE PLAN WITH THE STEPS I BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP SHOULD UNDERTAKE IMMEDIATELY TO BUILD ON THE ROADMAP I RELEASED BACK IN MARCH THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED LIVES THAT BEEN ADOPTED. IT'S A PLAN TO SAVE LIVES IN THE MONTHS AHEAD BUT ONCE AGAIN, I ENCOURAGE THEM TO ADOPT THIS PLAN IN ITS ENTIRETY. THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT FOR POLITICS. FIRST, TESTING, TESTING, TESTING. MORE TESTING IS NOT ONLY HOW YOU FIND MORE CASES OF CORONAVIRUS , MR. PRESIDENT, IS HOW YOU STOP CORONAVIRUS CASES. TESTING FOLLOWED BY RIGOROUS CONTACT TRACING, QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION PROTOCOLS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED. PEOPLE ARE NOT WAITING IN LINES FOR MILES AND MILES IN BAKING HOT CARS FOR DRIVE THROUGH NASAL SWABS FOR THE FUN OF IT, THEY'RE DOING IT SO THEY CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY KNOW WHEN THEY HAVE THE MASK ON, THEY ARE PROTECTING OTHERS. THEY ARE PROTECTING OTHERS. WE KNOW WE'RE NOT WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN TESTING, THERE ARE STILL HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE TEST THEY NEED. TESTING IS HOW WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT IS THE EYES ON THE GROUND. WITHOUT THAT TESTING, WE'RE FLYING BLIND. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE RELIABLE ACCESS TO TESTING EVERYWHERE. WE NEED TO INCREASE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR TESTING. THAT INCLUDES DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF DRIVE-THROUGH TESTING SITES AND KEEP INCREASING THEM UNTIL THERE ARE NO MORE LINE. WE SHOULD CREATE A PANDEMIC TESTING BOARD TO SPEARHEAD A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN SO EVERY WORKER, EVERY WORKER IS CALLED BACK TO THE JOB CAN HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY AND THEIR FELLOW WORKERS ARE NOT INFECTED . YOU KNOW, EXPERTS AGREE THAT WE NEED MORE CONTACT TRACERS TO TRACK THE PATH OF THIS VIRUS . INDIVIDUAL STATES LIKE NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA ALREADY HIRING AND TRAINING THOUSANDS OF TRACERS. BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE, INCLUDING HIRING AT LEAST 100,000 FEDERALLY FUNDED WORKERS TO PERFORM CONTACT TRACING AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH TASKS AND THEY SHOULD BEGIN TO BE TRAINED NOW. SECOND, EVERY SINGLE FRONTLINE WORKER SHOULD HAVE THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED TO BE SAFE. FIVE MONTHS INTO THIS CRISIS, AND THEIR HEALTH CARE WORKERS STILL ARE FORCED TO SCRAMBLE FOR THEIR OWN SUPPLIES AND HAVE TO REUSE THEIR MASKS SHIFT AFTER SHIFT. HUNDREDS OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE DIED FROM COVID-19 AND TENS OF THOUSANDS HAVE BECOME INFECTED. IT SHOULD BE ZERO ON BOTH COUNTS FOR THESE HEALTH CARE WORKERS IF THEY HAD THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT. HOW ARE WE BEST MANY MONTHS IN AND STILL DON'T HAVE WHAT WE NEED? THAT IS WHY WE NEED , WHY WE HAVE A DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT . USE YOUR AUTHORITY, MR. PRESIDENT. USE IT THIS WEEK SCALE UP THE PROTECTION OF N95 MASS YOU KNOW THE STEPS YOU'VE TAKEN SO FAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE JOB DONE. FIX THE SHORTAGE OF PPE FOR OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS BEFORE YOU TEE OFF ANOTHER ROUND OF GOLF WE CAN'T JUST LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. THIRD, WE SHOULD BE LASER FOCUSED ON TREATMENTS AND VACCINES. WE SHOULD BE LEADING A COORDINATED GLOBAL APPROACH ON THE SCIENCE, NOT DISREGARDING EXPERTS WHILE PUSHING DANGEROUS AND DISAPPROVED DRUGS AS IF THEY ARE TREATMENTS. THERE'S BEEN SOME PROGRESS TOWARD TREATMENT IN VACCINES BUT THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T BEEN TRANSPARENT ABOUT HOW THEY PLAN TO MANUFACTURE ENOUGH DOSES TO MAKE SURE THERE'S EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION TO SCALE. I HOPE THEY ARE DOING IT NOW. I CALL FOR A WHILE AGO THEY SHOULD BE FIGHTING 250 MILLION DOLLARS TO HAVE A PLAN NOW EXACTLY HOW THEY ARE GOING TO DISTRIBUTE THIS SO EVERY AMERICAN HAS ACCESS WHEN AND IF THE VACCINE IS AVAILABLE. THEY MAY BE DOING IT, BUT WE HAVE NO TRANSPARENCY. LET US SEE, MR. PRESIDENT. THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD REPORT WEEKLY ON THIS. WE CAN'T END UP IN THE SAME SCRATCHY AND DISTRIBUTION PROBLEMS THAT WE HAD IN TESTING . WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE CUSTOMERS AREN'T BEING GOUGED BY NEW DRUG IN THERAPIES AND PRICES WHEN THEY ARE DEVELOPED. WE HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY RESTORE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. FOR ALL ITS SHORTCOMINGS AND MISSTEPS AROUND COVID-19, THIS IS WHY THEY WERE CREATED. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO COORDINATING THE GLOBAL RESPONSE DURING A PANDEMIC AND THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE LEADING THAT RESPONSE AS WE HAD IN THE PAST. COVID-19 WILL LIKELY WORSEN AT THE OUTSET OF FLU SEASON THIS YEAR, SO WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE MEASURES NOW, NOW, TO ENSURE THE SEASONAL FLU VACCINE CAN BE READY COME AVAILABLE, AND ADMINISTERED SAFELY TO THOSE WHO NEED IT UNDER SOCIAL AND DISTANCING GUIDELINES, ESPECIALLY FOR SENIORS. FOURTHLY, WE NEED REAL PLANS, REAL GUIDELINES, WITH UNIFORM NATIONWIDE STANDARDS TO HELP US CHART OUR ECONOMIC REOPENING. WHATEVER WE'VE BEEN DOING NOW IS NOT WORKING. THE STATE-BY-STATE APPROACH WILL ONLY PRODUCE CONFUSION AND SLOW ANY PROGRESS. YOU KNOW, YOU ALL REPORTED THE CDC TRIED TO CLEAR GUIDELINES ABOUT WHAT STAGES OF REOPENING SHOULD LOOK LIKE, THE ADMINISTRATION DELAYED AND SCALED-BACK THOSE PLANS. WE NEED CLEAR EVIDENCE, CLEAR EVIDENCE-BASED STEPS THAT STATES CAN ADOPT NOW, BOTH THE STANDARD MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO SAFELY PROCEED WITH FURTHER OPENINGS, AND THE REPOSITION OF SOCIAL DISTANCING ROLES WHEN CASES BEGIN TO RISE. THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. WE NEED TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS AND CHILD CARE PROGRAMS SO PARENTS IF AND WHEN THEY CAN RETURN TO WORK ARE CONFIDENT THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE SAFE AND CARE D FOR. WE SHOULD BE HOLDING AND PROVIDING STICKERS THAT SAY \"SAFE FOR SHOPPERS,\" A CERTIFICATION TO STORES THAT PROVE THEIR MINIMIZING THEIR CUSTOMERS RISK AND EXPOSURE . WE ABSOLUTELY NEED A CLEAR MESSAGE FROM THE VERY TOP OF OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO WEAR A MASK IN PUBLIC , PERIOD. WEAR A MASK. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT YOU, IT'S ABOUT YOUR FAMILY, IT'S ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBORS, YOUR COLLEAGUES. IT'S ABOUT KEEPING OTHERS SAFE. IT HELPS YOU, YES, BUT IT'S ABOUT KEEPING OTHER PEOPLE SAFE. IT'S A SIMPLE MEASURE THAT IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS WE CAN DO THE RIGHT THING. IT MAY BE INCONVENIENT, IT MAY BE UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AS AN AMERICAN . PROTECT YOUR CO-WORKERS AND NEIGHBORS, AND FINALLY WE NEED TO PROTECT THE POPULATIONS MOST AT RISK, OUR SENIORS, ARE BLACK AND BROWN POPULATIONS, NATIVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING HIT THE HARDEST. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS KNOW THAT THIS CONTINUED GROWTH AND CASE NUMBERS IS CAUSING A LOT OF FEAR AND ANXIETY. PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY OLDER AMERICANS AND THOSE ARE THE LOVED ONES AND NURSING HOMES, I GET CALLS ALL THE TIME. THEY ARE SCARED. THEY ARE FRIGHTENED. THIS IS NOT JUST TAKING A TOLL ON PHYSICAL HEALTH, THERE IS AN EMOTIONAL COST AS WELL. WE CAN'T EXPECT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO QUARANTINE INDEFINITELY WITHOUT SUPPORT, AND I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY WILL BE MY RESPONSIBILITY IF I'M YOUR PRESIDENT. I WILL NOT ABANDON YOU. YOU KNOW, THESE ARE FIVE FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD STEPS THEY'RE GOING TO HELP DEFEAT THE PANDEMIC. AND IF YOU SUSPECT THAT A LOT OF THESE STEPS ARE THE SAME SORTS OF THINGS I WAS TALKING ABOUT A , IN MARCH WHEN I RELEASED MY FIRST COVID-19 RESPONSE, YOU WOULD BE RIGHT. IF IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE HEARING THE EXPERTS TALK ABOUT THE SAME ISSUES FOR MONTHS, YOU'D BE RIGHT. THESE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE STEPS THE GOVERNMENT NEEDED TO PUT IN PLACE TO MEET THE THREAT. STATEWIDE LOCKDOWNS THAT SO MANY AMERICANS LIVED UNDER FOR MONTHS WERE INTENDED TO BUY US TIME TO GET OUR ACT TOGETHER. INSTEAD OF USING THAT TIME TO PREPARE OURSELVES, DONALD TRUMP SQUANDERED IT. NOW HERE WE ARE MORE THAN THREE MONTHS LATER, WE'RE HARDLY BETTER PREPARED THAN WE WERE IN MARCH. INFECTIONS ARE ON THE RISE, THE THREAT OF MASSIVE SPIKES THAT OVERWHELM THE CAPACITY OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS ON THE RISE. AMERICANS ANXIOUS AND OUT OF WORK ARE FEARFUL FOR THEIR LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS. DONALD TRUMP IS DOING NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT IT. MR. PRESIDENT, THE CRISIS IS REAL AND IT IS SURGING, MR. PRESIDENT. YOUR PROMISES AND PREDICTIONS AND WISHFUL THINKING PULLED OUT OF THIN AIR ARE NOT ONLY DOING THE COUNTRY NO GOOD MAKING THEM LOSE EVEN MORE FAITH IN THEIR GOVERNMENT. AMERICA KNOWS THIS CRISIS ISN'T BEHIND US, EVEN IF YOU DON'T . THEY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING, EVEN IF YOU REFUSE TO, MR. PRESIDENT. THEY KNOW WE NEED A COORDINATED NATIONAL PLAN WE NEED NOW EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T AND WON'T DO IT. YOU CALLED YOURSELF A CHEERLEADER. WE DO NOT NEED A CHEERLEADER, MR. PRESIDENT. WE NEED A PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDENT WHO WILL LEVEL WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. A PRESIDENT WHO WILL TELL US THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH, WHO WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND OF ALWAYS BLAMING OTHERS. A PRESIDENT WHO WILL LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS, FOLLOW THE SCIENCE, ALLOW THEM TO SPEAK. A PRESIDENT WHO WILL LEAD AND BE AN EXAMPLE FOR THE NATION, WEAR A MASK, KEEP YOUR DISTANCE, THE SIDES , SIZE OF CROWDS. MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T MAKE ENORMOUS SACRIFICES OVER THE PAST FOUR MONTHS SO THEY COULD JUST WASTE, WASTE THEIR TIME AND YOU CAN WASTE ALL THE EFFORTS THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN WITH YOUR MIDNIGHT RANTINGS AND TWEETS. THEY DON'T MAKE THESE SACRIFICES SO YOU CAN IGNORE THE SCIENCE AND TURN RESPONSIBLE STEPS LIKE WEARING MASKS INTO A POLITICAL STATEMENT. AND THEY CERTAINLY DID NOT DO IT, MR. PRESIDENT, SO YOU COULD WASH YOUR HANDS AND WALK AWAY FROM THIS RESPONSIBILITY. MAYBE THERE ARE TIMES THIS NATION NEEDS A CHEERLEADER NOW , CHEERLEADER. NOW IS NOT ONE OF THEM. AMERICA NEEDS A PRESIDENT. WHATEVER TRUMP DOES IT DOES NOT DO, WE CAN'T KNOW TODAY WITH THE STATE OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL BE NEXT JANUARY. I HOPE I TURN OUT TO BE WRONG, BUT I AM ALMOST CERTAIN IT WILL NOT BE OVER. AND IF I SHOULD HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT, ON THE DAY I'M SWORN IN, I'LL GET RIGHT TO WORK IMPLEMENTING ALL ASPECTS OF THE RESPONSE THAT REMAIN UNDONE. I WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT MY DAY ONE OF COVID-19 AGENDA IN THE WEEKS TO COME, BUT MY RESPONSE WILL BEGIN WELL BEFORE I TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE. IT WILL START AS SOON AS THE ELECTION IS DECIDED. I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO RESPECTS SCIENTISTS AND WON'T CENSOR THEIR ABILITY TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I WILL IMMEDIATELY REACH OUT TO DR. ANTHONY FAUCI TO ASK HIM TO CONTINUES INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY AND I'LL HAVE FROM DAY ONE READY TO GO THE BEST MEDICAL EXPERTS AND SCIENTISTS TO ADVISE ON OUR RESPONSE MAYBE , RESPONSE. MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WILL LISTEN TO THEM AND LET THEM SPEAK FREELY, AND I'LL WORK WITH THE GOVERNORS AND MAYORS OF BOTH PARTIES FROM EVERY STATE , TERRITORY, AND TRIBE. IT'S A SIMPLE PROPOSITION. WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND WE HAVE TO FIGHT THIS TOGETHER. WE WILL EMERGE FROM THIS STRONGER BECAUSE WE DID IT TOGETHER. I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND PROTECT OUR TROOPS. I AM HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY. THEY GAVE ME A LIST ON HOW TO RECOGNIZE. IS ALEX AP OUT THERE? CAN'T TELL WITH THE MASK ON. WE REPORTED YESTERDAY PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD BE BRIEFED AS EARLY AS MARCH 2019 THAT RUSSIA HAD ORDERED OR OFFERED BOUNTIES TO THE TALIBAN FOR THE KILLING OF U.S. SOLDIERS. YOU CALLED HIS AN ACTION ON THE ISSUE A BETRAYAL. BROADLY, WHAT QUINCES , WHAT CONSEQUENCES DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD FACE FOR BETRAYAL AND WHAT SHOULD CONGRESS DO? JOE BIDEN: CONGRESS AND THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES FOR BOTH PARTIES SHOULD DEMAND FACTS. THIS SEEMS TO BE A MOVING STORY. AS I WAS LEAVING, I HAD THE TELEVISION ON AND I UNDERSTAND THERE IS MORE INFORMATION THAT HAS COME OUT TODAY ABOUT WHAT WAS KNOWN. ONE OF TWO THINGS. THIS PRESIDENT TALKS ABOUT COGNITIVE CAPABILITY BUT HE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE COGNITIVELY AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON. HE EITHER READS AND\/OR IS BRIEFED ON IMPORTANT ISSUES AND FORGETS IT, OR HE DOESN'T THINK IT IS NECESSARY THAT HE NEEDS TO KNOW IT. BUT THE FACT IS THAT AT A MINIMUM, THE DISCREPANCY ALLEGEDLY BETWEEN AND WITHIN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS REPORTED SOME THOUGHT IT WAS MORE CERTAIN THAN OTHERS THOUGHT IT WAS LESS CERTAIN. THAT SHOULD BE RESOLVED. ON DAY ONE, THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE SAID, I WANT YOU TO COME BEFORE ME IN THE SITUATION ROOM AND LAY OUT THE DIFFERENCES IN DISCUSSIONS, WHO IS SAYING WHAT, LET US GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, IT IS CLEAR TO ME, AND I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE DID, BUT HE SHOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED OUR JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF AND GOT THEM ALL IN ONE ROOM AND SAID, OK, WHAT ARE WE DOING TO PREVENT THIS? WHAT ARE WE DOING TO PREPARE TO DEAL WITH THIS, IF THIS IS HAPPENING? ? HOW ARE WE DOING THIS? WHAT ARE WE DOING? THIRDLY, AT A MINIMUM HE SHOULD HAVE PICKED UP THE PHONE AND SAID VLADIMIR, OLD BUDDY, IF ANY OF THIS IS TRUE, IT SEEMS TO ME WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM. A BIG PROBLEM. AND MAKE IT CLEAR, GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. IT APPEARS AS THOUGH, I DO NOT HAVE CLASS , I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ANYMORE, BUT WHAT I HAVE HEARD OVER THE LAST WEEK AND THE RECENT REPORTING THAT IT WAS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DAILY BRIEF, THE PRESIDENT , IT IS SOMETHING I READ EVERY DAY AS VICE PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDENT READ IT EVERY DAY AND I WAS BRIEFED EVERY MORNING BEFORE HE GOT TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEN AGAIN. SO THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW HE DID NOT KNOW OR IS NOT BEING BRIEFED IS A DERELICTION OF DUTY, IF THAT IS THE CASE. AND IF HE WAS BRIEFED AND NOTHING WAS DONE ABOUT IT, THAT IS A DERELICTION OF DUTY. I GUESS THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO IN THIS IS I WAS TALKING TO MY WIFE JILL. I DO NOT SEE HER GET OUTRAGED OFTEN. I STARTED ASKING, JILL, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF BEAU WAS STILL IN HARM'S WAY AND THIS INFORMATION CAME OUT AND, I APOLOGIZE, BEAU WAS MY SON AND SERVED IN AFGHANISTAN. WHAT ARE THE PARENTS THINKING? WHAT ARE THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS, HUSBANDS AND WIVES? IT IS A DERELICTION OF DUTY. IF ANY OF THIS IS EVEN REMOTELY TRUE. SO I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS A LOT TO ANSWER FOR AND YOU SHOULD GET ANSWERS QUICKLY. WHAT QUESTIONS SHOULD HE PHASE IF THE ALLEGATIONS AND REPORTS ARE TRUE? JOE BIDEN: IF THEY ARE TRUE WHEN HE DID NOTHING ABOUT ANY OF THIS, IN FACT I THINK THE PUBLIC SHOULD CONCLUDE THIS MAN IS NOT FIT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NBC MIGHT , MIGHT , MIKE. WHEN WE SAW YOU ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, YOU ARE LOCKED IN A DIFFICULT BATTLE BUT POLLS TODAY SHOW YOU WITH A NATIONAL LEAD IN STATES THAT ARE CRITICAL IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. WHERE DO YOU THINK THE RACE STANDS AT THIS MOMENT? WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT AS YOU LOOK AHEAD AND CAN YOU MAINTAIN THE ADVANTAGE WITHOUT CAMPAIGNING IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY? ESPECIALLY IN THE FALL WHEN VOTERS BEGIN TO TUNE IN? JOE BIDEN: THIS IS THE MOST UNUSUAL CAMPAIGN IN MODERN HISTORY. I START OFF WITH THE PREMISE THAT I WILL FOLLOW DOCTOR'S ORDERS NOT JUST FOR ME, BUT FOR THE COUNTRY. THAT MEANS I AM NOT GOING TO BE HOLDING RALLIES, I AM NOT GOING TO BE , FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WERE HERE BUT SCHOOLS HAVE PUT THOSE CIRCLES AROUND SO EVERYONE IS SOCIAL DISTANCING AND WEARING MASKS. SO AS SOON AS I FINISH I WILL PUT MY MASK BACK ON. SO IT HAS ALMOST ALL BEEN VIRTUAL, ALTHOUGH I HAVE GONE TO HOUSTON AND HAVE TRAVELED. BUT I GET IN MAKE MY CASE, TAKE QUESTIONS, AND LEAVE. BUT YOU KNOW ME, I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE OUT THERE WITH PEOPLE BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE I GET THE GREATEST FEEL, I CAN GET A SENSE BY THE LOOK IN THEIR EYES AND THE PLAINTIFF VOICES OF WHAT THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. NOTWITHSTANDING THAT, I HAVE BEEN SURPRISED, THE IRONY IS WE PROBABLY REACHED MORE PEOPLE DIRECTLY ON ONE-ON-ONE. PARTICULARLY THOSE OF YOU WITH TELEVISION STATIONS, YOU ALL KNOW THAT WHEN YOU ARE ON, HAVING A ONE-TO-ONE CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE OUT THERE, BECAUSE ONE PERSON ON TV LOOKING AT YOU. I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY BEFORE. THEY TELL ME 200 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE WATCHED WHAT I HAVE DONE FROM HOME AND A HALF A DOZEN THINGS WE HAVE GONE OUT AND DONE. SO THE IRONY IS I THINK WE ARE PROBABLY COMMUNICATING DIRECTLY IN DETAIL WITH MORE PEOPLE THAN WE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE. BUT I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE DOING IT IN PERSON. SO FAR, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. I DO NOT WANT TO JINX MYSELF. THE POLLING DATA IS GOOD BUT IT IS EARLY, TOO EARLY TO MAKE A JUDGMENT. WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. I PLAN ON LAYING OUT IN DETAIL MY ECONOMIC PLAN ON HOW TO RECOVER FROM THIS, PLAN ON DEALING WITH WORKING OUT IN DETAIL WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IS COMING. I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. HAVE YOU REQUESTED A CLASSIFIED BRIEFING YOU WOULD BE ENTITLED TO AS THE NOMINEE? HAS THE ADMINISTRATION OFFERED YOU A CLASSIFIED BRIEFING? JOE BIDEN: THEY HAVE NOT. IF THIS PROCEEDS, I MIGHT DO THAT. I HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN POLICY STAFF, AS YOU KNOW. DOZENS OF THEM. I HAD A LONG MEETING WITH MY FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR'S, FORMER SECRETARIES, ETC. AND WHAT THEY HAVE HEARD SO FAR. BUT IF IT DOES NOT GET CLEARED UP QUICKLY, I WILL SEEK AND ASK IF I CAN BE BRIEFED. OVER THE WEEKEND, PRINCETON DECIDED TO REMOVE WOODROW WILSON'S NAME FROM THEIR SCHOOL BECAUSE OF RACIST THINKING. PRESIDENT TRUMP YESTERDAY CALLED THE DECISION INCREDIBLE STUPIDITY. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT PRINCETON , PRINCETON'S DECISION ON THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS AND WE ARE SEEING THE REMOVAL OF STATUES AND NAMES FROM INSTITUTIONS AND SCHOOLS. DO YOU THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH TO COME TO TERMS WITH OUR NATIONS HISTORY AND ITS LEADERS? WHAT DO YOU THINK WHEN YOU SEE THE REMOVAL OF THESE STATUES? JOE BIDEN: I THINK THERE WERE THREE CATEGORIES. ONE, ANY INSTITUTION THAT CHOSE A NAME AND WANTS TO JETTISON THAT NAME NOW, THEY HAVE THAT DECISION TO MAKE FOR WHATEVER REASON. I AM ASSUMING THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY MADE THE JUDGMENT ABOUT THE WOODROW WILSON SCHOOL. I DO NOT KNOW. BUT IT WAS MADE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INSTITUTION THAT CHOSE THE NAME AND I'LL NO LONGER WANTS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT. I THINK THE PRESIDENT , WELL, SECONDLY, I THINK THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN, AS THE FORMER MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS SAID, A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REMINDERS AND REMEMBRANCES OF HISTORY AND RECOVERING FROM HISTORY. SO THE IDEA OF COMPARING WHETHER OR NOT GEORGE WASHINGTON OWNED SLAVES OR THOMAS JEFFERSON OWNED SLAVES AND SOMEBODY WHO WAS IN REBELLION, COMMITTING TREASON, TRYING TO TAKE DOWN A UNION TO KEEP SLAVERY, I THINK THERE IS A DISTINCTION. SO I THINK THE IDEA, I THINK ALL OF THE CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS TO CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS AND GENERALS ETC. WHO STRONGLY SUPPORTED SECESSION AND MAINTAINED SLAVERY AND WENT TOWARD TO DO IT, THOUGH STATUES BELONG IN MUSEUMS, NOT PUBLIC PLACES. IN REGARD TO THE STATUES AND MONUMENTS LIKE THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL, I THINK THERE IS AN OBLIGATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROTECT THOSE MONUMENTS, BECAUSE THAT IS A REMEMBRANCE, IT IS NOT DEALING WITH REVERING SOMEONE WHO HAD THAT VIEW. THEY HAD MUCH BROADER USE THAT ARE IN THE PAST THAT ARE NOW AND THEN DISTASTEFUL, BUT THAT'S A JUDGMENT FOR THE COUNCIL. FOR EXAMPLE, TOPPLING CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS STATUE OR GEORGE WASHINGTON STATUE, ETC., I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT FROM HAPPENING. YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THESE PUBLIC EVENTS FOR THE PAST MONTH, WHICH HAS PUT YOU IN CONTACT WITH MORE PEOPLE. HAVE YOU BEEN TESTED FOR CORONAVIRUS, AND IF SO, HOW FREQUENTLY ARE YOU DOING THAT? JOE BIDEN: I HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED FOR CORONAVIRUS FOR TWO REASONS. ONE, I HAVE HAD NO SYMPTOMS, AS MY BROTHER , AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, KNOCK ON WOOD. WHEN I HAVE NOT WANTED TO TAKE ANYONE ELSE'S PLACE IN THE PROCESS. BUT THE SECRET SERVICE GETS TESTED. THEY ARE AROUND MY HOME AND ANYONE WHO COMES INTO MY HOME, INCLUDING STAFF THAT COMES IN, IS TESTED TO DETERMINE IF THEY HAVE THE VIRUS. I EXPECT WHAT I WILL DO SO DOES NOT LOOK LIKE I AM MOVING INTO THE FRONT OF THE LINE IS TO BE TESTED RELATIVELY SOON. MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN TESTED. SHE WAS IN FLORIDA, SHE IS A SOCIAL WORKER WICKING , WORKING WITH THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB. BEFORE SHE CAME HOME SHE WAS TESTED TWICE TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS CLEAR. BUT I HAVE NOT YET TESTED YET. I AM NOT SURE WHO I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO NEXT. I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I GET TO THE WILMINGTON NEWSPAPER OR I WILL BE DEAD. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU. I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO DO THIS AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. JOE BIDEN: I WILL. THE MORE I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, I YESTERDAY YOU SAID AT A FUNDRAISER REGARDING VLADIMIR PUTIN, I WILL CONFRONT VLADIMIR PUTIN, STRENGTHEN NATO, MAKE CLEAR TO VLADIMIR PUTIN THAT HE WILL HAVE A PRICE TO PAY FOR INTERFERENCE IN OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU WOULD DO TO HIM IF THIS IS TRUE AND IF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST? JOE BIDEN: I WOULD TELL HIM, HERE IS THE DEAL. THE IDEA THAT PUTIN OR ANY OTHER FOREIGN LEADER CAN ENGAGE IN ATTEMPTING TO MANIPULATE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THE IDEA THAT HE CONTINUES HIS ACTIVITIES IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE THAT HE IS DOING, AND THE IDEA THAT IT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT ANY CONSEQUENCES IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IF I AM PRESIDENT AND MY ADMINISTRATION. THAT RANGES FROM EVERYTHING FROM MAKING SURE WE GO TO THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL ALL THE WAY TO IMPOSING SANCTIONS THAT WOULD BE COMMENSURATE WITH THE ACTION THAT HE HAS TAKEN THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE. BUT I HAVE HAD SOME VERY BLUNT, STRAIGHTFORWARD CONVERSATIONS WITH PRESIDENT , I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE MORE COMPETITION. THE SUPREME COURT. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD ISSUE AN UPDATED LIST OF POTENTIAL NOMINEES TO THE COURT. YOU HAVE SAID HE WOULD PUT A BLACK WOMAN ON THE COURT IF A SPOT OPENED UP. THERE ARE CALLS FOR YOU TO RELEASE A LIST OF NAMES. ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT? I HESITATE TO DO ANYTHING THE PRESIDENT DIES BECAUSE HE USUALLY DOES IT ALL WRONG. WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A LIST OF A GROUP OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN WHO ARE QUALIFIED AND HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO BE IN THE COURT. I WILL NOT RELEASE IT UNTIL WE GET FURTHER DOWN THE LINE. I AM NOT RELEASING THE NAMES OF VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WOMEN OF COLOR, LATINO WOMEN OR ASIAN, ACROSS-THE-BOARD. WE HAD JUST UNDERWAY, GOING INTO THE DEEP BACKGROUND CHECKS. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. THIS IS A TWO-PARTER. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF THOSE REPORTS ARE TRUE THAT TRUMP IS GUILTY OF VIOLATING HIS OATH OF OFFICE? YOU SAID YOU WANT YOUR RUNNING MATE TO BE READY ON DAY ONE TO DO THE JOB. DO YOU THINK THEY COULD BE READY ON DAY ONE? IT. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO , TRY TO FIND PEOPLE WHO HAVE A BACKGROUND AND EXPERTISE THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE. ONE OF THE REASONS PRESIDENT OBAMA PICKED ME IS THAT I HAVE CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE GETTING THINGS DONE IN THE CONGRESS. ALTHOUGH HE HAD CLEAR VIEWS, , WHAT HIS STRATEGY WAS, HE WAS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO HAD DAY-TO-DAY EXPERIENCE. ALTHOUGH THAT IS HELPFUL, IT IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE I START OFF WITH THE PLACES I HAVE EXPERTISE. SO, ALMOST ALL OF THE WOMEN I AM CONSIDERING HAVE HAD SOME EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL DEFENSE ISSUES, BUT NOT IS NOT A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT. THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT THEY HAVE THE INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY, TEMPERAMENT, AS WELL AS A LEADERSHIP QUALITY THAT LENDS EVERYONE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE READY ON DAY ONE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. IN REGARDS TO WHETHER , IT DEPENDS ON WHAT HE DID AND WHAT HE KNEW, BUT AT A MINIMUM, EITHER DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HIS JOB AND IS HAVING DIFFICULTY SITTING DOWN AND BEING ABLE TO READ A REPORT , BECAUSE A LOT OF REPORTS COME ACROSS THAT HE DID NOT READ IT OR SEE IT. I DO NOT KNOW HOW HE COULD NOT READ SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE COME UP ACROSS THE LAST THREE YEARS. IT IS CLEARLY A DERELICTION OF DUTY. IT IS CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT I THINK EVERYONE, INCLUDING MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS AND MY REPUBLICAN OPPONENTS IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE ARE WORRIED ABOUT AS WELL. WHERE IS THE DELAWARE STATE NEWS? THE DELAWARE NEWS JOURNAL? THAT IS MY HOMETOWN TEAM. HOW ARE YOU? LIKE OTHER STATES, DELAWARE IS SEEING AN INCREASE IN CORONAVIRUS CASES. YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FOR HOW THEY HAVE HANDLED THE PANDEMIC SO FAR AND HOW THEY WILL I THINK YOU ICING THE GOVERNOR MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. IT WAS ONE OF THE STATES , I GET BRIEFED EVERY DAY BY A GROUP OF DOCTORS AROUND THE COUNTRY. EVERY DAY, AND GET , I GET A PRINTOUT OF THE STATE DOING BETTER AND DOING WORSE. NOW, IT IS OPENING UP SLIGHTLY. I HAVE NOT SPOKEN WITH THEM TODAY. I WOULD GUESS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT HOW THAT OCCURRED. I DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THAT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IT HAS FLATTENED OUT. I HAVE NOT GONE INTO THE DETAILS WITH THE GOVERNOR, NOR HAVE I , I DO NOT SPEAK WITH HIM FREQUENTLY, BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT IS POPPING UP. THE WAY TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE IS , HOW TO SAY THIS POLITELY. IT IS TO LOWER THE RHETORIC BASED ON DIVISION. STOP APPEALING TO THE LESS HEALTHY SIDE OF SOCIETY. INSTEAD OF WHEN A GOLF CART GOES BY YELLING WHITE SUPREMACY AND THE PRESIDENT TWEETS IT OUT , DO NOT DO THINGS LIKE THAT. BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. WE ARE GIVING A PORTION OF THE POPULATION, WHO HAS RESPONDED A SORT OF FREE PASS. IT GENERATES DIVISION. YOU'RE ALSO TALKING IN TERMS OF THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT MANHOOD AND EATING STRONG, YOU DO NOT NEED THE MASK. WE NEED TO START APPEALING TO THE BETTER SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE BY POINTING OUT THAT THE MASK IS NOT SO MUCH TO PROTECT ME. IT IS IF I HAVE BEEN I , UNDIAGNOSED. IT IS TO PROTECT YOU FROM ME AND PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE. IT IS CALLED PATRIOTISM. IT IS CALLED RESPONSIBILITY, LOOKING OUT FOR THE OTHER PERSON. WE HAVE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME , THE PRESIDENT PUTS EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF HIMSELF. EVERYTHING IS ABOUT HIM. IT IS I DO NOT THINK OR I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. OR I BELIEVE THAT. IT IS ABOUT US, AND I THINK CHANGING THE TONE OF AN ADMINISTRATION ACROSS-THE-BOARD, ALLOWING SCIENTISTS TO SPEAK, MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE FACTS. WHEN A MISTAKE IS MADE, SAY, I MADE A MISTAKE. I WAS WRONG. ALL THOSE THINGS CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE. LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING THIS. YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE. THE WORDS OF A PRESIDENT MATTER, NO MATTER WHO THE PRESIDENT IS, NO MATTER HOW RESPONSIBLE OR IRRESPONSIBLE. A PRESIDENT CAN TAKE US TO WAR OR BRING PEACE. APPEALED TO THE SENIOR SIDE OF HUMANITY. IT MATTERS. IT REALLY MATTERS. I THINK IT IS ABOUT THE TONE, AND IT GOES ACROSS THE BOARD. I KNOW THAT I WAS CRITICIZED DURING THE PRIMARY BY SAYING THAT I PLAN ON UNITING THE COUNTRY, BRINGING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER. WE HAVE TO DO THAT. IF WE CANNOT, WE CANNOT FUNCTION. WE HAVE TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. ON THIS PIECE, IF WE STAND UP , BY THE WAY, YOU CAN CORRECT ME ON THIS, BUT I THINK SOMETHING LIKE 74 OR 75% OF AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK THAT YOU SHOULD WEAR A MASK. SOME THINK WE SHOULD OPEN MORE SLOWLY. I THINK WE SHOULD BE TALKING AND ACTUALLY MAKING PEOPLE FEEL GUILTY FOR NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING. APPEAL TO THEIR BETTER NATURE. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS ALMOST IDEALISTIC, BUT IT IS NOT. REMIND PEOPLE. IF YOU DO NOT WEAR THIS MASK, YOU END UP HURTING SOMEONE OR YOU GET INFECTED. YOU COULD TAKE IT HOME TO YOUR CHILD, YOUR MOTHER, YOUR FATHER, YOUR HUSBAND OR WIFE. YOU HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION BECAUSE IT IS. IT REALLY IS. THANK YOU. I REALLY DO HAVE TO GO. I APOLOGIZE. I AM GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE. GO AHEAD. I'M SORRY. GOOD TO SEE YOU. I AM CONFUSED ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF MONUMENTS. YOU TALK ABOUT THE FATHER'S OF THIS COUNTRY. OUR CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS WERE THE? SHOULD THEY BE TORN DOWN WITHOUT THE VOTE OF LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS? I THINK IT IS DIFFERENT. I THINK IT IS BETTER IF IT IS TAKEN DOWN THE SAME WAY THAT THE CONFEDERATE FLAG WAS TAKEN OFF OF THE MISSISSIPPI STATE FLAG. I CAN UNDERSTAND THE ANGER AND ANGUISH THAT PEOPLE FEEL BY HAVING THEN UNDER THE STATUE OF ROBERT E LEE. IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO DO IT PEACEFULLY. THOSE MONUMENTS , I SHIFT RESPONSIBILITY. I THINK ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MOVE. PUT THEM IN MUSEUMS. GET THEM DOWN, BUT DO NOT EXPECT, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, FINALLY GOING TO ANOTHER PHASE OF MAJOR RESPONDING TO THE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN AMERICA. DO NOT BE SURPRISED IF SOMEONE PULLED DOWN A STATUE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS. IT IS BETTER THAT THEY DO NOT, BUT IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAN PULLING DOWN THE STATUE OR GOING TO THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL TO TRY , NOT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL. THAT IS A BAD EXAMPLE. THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL. YES. THREE. I AM COMMITTED TO FOLLOWING THE NATIONAL DEBATE GROUP THAT SETS UP THESE DEBATES. IT HAS BEEN THIS WAY FOR A LONG TIME. THE FIRST ONE IS A ONE-ON-ONE DEBATE. THE OTHER ONE IS A TOWN MEETING SETTING. ANOTHER IS A NORMAL DEBATE. I COMMIT TO THOSE AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM. SOME HAVE SPECULATED THAT YOU ARE SUBJECT TO SOME DEGREE OF COGNITIVE DECLINE. I AM 65 AND I DO NOT HAVE THE WORD RECOLLECTION THAT I USED TO HAVE. YOU HAVE 12 YEARS ON ME. HAVE YOU BEEN TESTED FOR SOME DEGREE OF COGNITIVE DECLINE?

HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT HIS PLAN TO BOOST FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. HOSTED BY THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION, THIS IS ABOUT 40 MINUTES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. I'M JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND, JOE BIDEN. AND LILY THANKS FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER AND FOR THE ENERGY AND LEADERSHIP YOU BROUGHT TO THIS INDISPENSABLE ORGANIZATION. YOU KNOW, YOU ALL HEAD UP A UNION, AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS , HOLDS THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY IN YOUR HANDS. AND WHAT DETERMINES TO OUR CHILDREN DETERMINES WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS NATION. THEY'RE OUR CHILDREN. THEY LIFT OUR NATIONAL AMBITION AA LOT OF. AND YOU HAVE THEM IN YOUR HANDS. AND YOUR MEMBERS ARE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU. AND I'M ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THAT BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE AS I SAID NEITHER ONE OF YOU MEMBERS. JILL AND I ARE TRULY HONORED TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT AND I MEAN THAT FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. I CAN'T WAIT TO REPLACE BETSY DEVOS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRUST , TO MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF PROGRESS TOGETHER BECAUSE I'M CONFIDENT , I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT WE CAN WIN. THIS IS GOING TO BE A TEACHER ORIENTED DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO COME FROM THE TOP DOWN. IT'S GOING TO COME ARE THE TEACHERS UP. I KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES. BUT THE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE IS THE CONTINUAL SPREAD OF THE CORONAVIRUS AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR. LOOK, WE SAW THIS CHALLENGE COMING. I'VE BEEN CALLING FOR THE PRESIDENT SINCE LATE JANUARY. DONALD TRUMP FAILED TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON TESTING, CONTACT TRACING, CREATING RESPONSIBLE STANDARDS, EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DO TO GET THIS UNDER CONTROL AND TO GET EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM. AND YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS NEEDED. FRANKLY, WE'VE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD. BACK IN 2009 WHEN I WAS OVERSEAING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECOVERY ACT IN THE FACE OF THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS IN AMERICAN HISTORY, WITH KNEW WE , WE KNEW WE HAD TO STAND UP FOR EDUCATORS. IT WAS ALMOST AN $84 BILLION PROGRAM THAT HAD TO GET THROUGHOUT WITHIN THE MATTER OF 16 , PROBABLY 18 MONTHS. AND HAD LESS FRAUD, LESS THAN .2 OF 1%. HERE'S WHAT IT DID. IT ALLOCATED $60 BILLION TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. 400,000 EDUCATION JOBS. WE KNEW IT HAD TO BE DONE IN THE FACE OF THE CRISIS. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDERSTOOD THAT EVERY STATE HAS , REQUIRES TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGET. LOCALITIES HAVE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. THERE'S A REASON WHY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN'T DEAL WITH CRISIS LIKE THIS. AND THIS TIME AROUND TRUMP TRIED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FAILED , TRIED TO SUPPORT EDUCATORS. TRUMP FAILED TO DO IT. TRUMP AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WERE FACING HUGE SHORT FALSE. SPEAKER PELOSI, A REAL LEADER IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DID THEIR JOB. THEY GOT SOMETHING DONE CALLED THE HEROES ACT $950 BILLION FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TRUMP REFUSED TO DO THE JOB. THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE. SO I'M MAKING SURE EDUCATOR'S SALARY DON'T GET CUT AND EDUCATORS DON'T GET FIRED. WE COULD HAVE KEPT EVERY EDUCATOR EMPLOYED. BUT INSTEAD WE LOST 900,000 EDUCATION JOBS DUE TO BUDGET CUTS. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. WE'RE ALREADY SHORT THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS WE NEED NATIONALLY BEFORE THIS CRISIS. LAST MONTH, I PUT OUT A PLAN TO REOPEN SAFELY AND SUSTAINABLY INCLUDING FOR OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I REQUIRE STEPS LIKE ONE INSURING THE SCHOOLS HAVE FUNDING FOR PHYSICAL LIKE PLEXIGLAS TO MAXIMIZE SOCIAL DISTANCING, ALL THE THINGS THAT SCIENTISTS TELL US WE NEED TO DO. AND WE NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CLEAR GUIDANCE. FINALLYER WE NEED TO PREVENT FURTHER EXACERBATING INEQUITIES IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. WITH BROADBAND AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES SO THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN LEARNING. YOU KNOW, THERE'S PROBABLY A HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT WE'LL NEED TO CONTINUE TO RELY ON REMOTE LEARNING AND PARTS OF THE COUNTRY FOR A WHILE LONGER. AND WE SEE, AND ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT THE STUDENT'S ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY CAN COST KIDS UP TO A YEAR OF LEARNING WE NEED TO GET THIS DONE NOW. WE'VE BEEN ARGUING FOR A WHILE IT'S ONLY JUST A PART BECAUSE ONCE WE GET AHEAD OF THIS PANDEMIC, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE PROGRESS. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU AND YOUR STUDENTS GET TREATED WITH DIGNITY THAT YOU DESERVE. MY EDUCATION PLAN IS TRIPLING THE FUNDING, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT JUST DISTRICTS ARE SENIOR TO DO IS INSURE HIGHER LEARNING EDUCATION MONEY. HIGHER SALARIES FOR EDUCATORS. THAT MONEY WOULD ELIMINATE THE $23 BILLION ANNUAL GAP BETWEEN MAJORITY WHITE AND NONWHITE DISTRICTS. IT'S ONE OF THE SINGLE BEST INSTRUMENTS AND INVESTMENTS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC INEQUALITY. IN ADDITION TO GETTING THE RAISE THAT YOU DESERVE, WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED. WE'RE GOING TO DOUBLE THE NUMBERS WITH SOCIAL WORKERS IN SCHOOL. MENTAL HEALTH IS AN ENORMOUS ISSUE. AND THE NEED IS ONLY GETTING EXACERBATED BY THIS PANDEMIC ON BOTH EDUCATORS AS WELL AS STUDENTS. THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE IN MY PLAN. WE'RE GOING TO FIX UNIVERSAL PRE-K FOR ALL 3-YEAR-OLDS. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS WHEN WE WIN THIS ELECTION, WE'RE GOING TO GET THE SUPPORT YOU NEED AND THE RESPECT YOU DESERVE. YOU DON'T JUST HAVE A PARTNER IN THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU'LL HAVE ANOTHER MEMBER IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IF I DON'T LISTEN I'M GOING TO GET A REPORT IN THE LINCOLN BEDROOM , WE'RE ABSOLUTELY TOTALLY COMMITTED TO MAKE SO MUCH MORE PROGRESS. THERE'S SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT. I KNOW YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. I WISH I COULD TALK LONGER ABOUT HOW PASSIONATE I FEEL ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS. MY MOTHER WOULD SAY HUSH UP AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS. YES, THANK YOU SO MUCH. YEAH, I KNOW. I KNOW. I WASN'T ARGUING WITH YOU. SO HERE , [LAUGHTER] HERE IS YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED OUR SUPPORT IN THE PRIMARY THAT IS ALMOST OVER. AND THAT PART OF OUR PROCESS NOW IS FOR YOU TO MAKE YOUR CASE TO THE 8,000 , ALMOST 8,000 DELEGATES THAT ARE WATCHING YOU RIGHT NOW. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ASKED IS TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS FROM OUR MEMBERS WHO ASKED THEM, I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU WANTING THAT. I COULD IS IT HERE AND I COULD READ THEM TO YOU. BUT WE TOOK YOU UP ON THAT. WE FOUND SOME DELEGATES WHO HAD ASKED SOME OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS THAT CAME TO US. WE SAID GO UP. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM JOE BIDEN? AND SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE HAD 88 MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT THOSE QUESTIONS ONLINE. AND OF THE THOUSANDS, THESE ARE THE DELEGATES THAT WERE SELECTED. SO LET'S GO NOW TO TURQUOISE PARKER IN DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA. TURQUOISE IS A K-5 MEDIA SPECIALIST. TURQUOISE, YOU MAY NOW ASK YOUR QUESTION TO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN TURQUOISE. HELLO, PRESIDENT LILY AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN MY NAME IS TURQUOISE LEGUME PARKER. I'M A MEDIA COORDINATOR. BUT SELF-GIVEN TITLE IS RACIAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE TEACHER. THIS UPCOMING YEAR WILL BE MY 10TH YEAR TEACHING. WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE FOLKS BRE ONA TAYLOR KILLED TO BE CHARGED YEARS AGO. BUT YOU ARE CURRICULUM AFFIRMS AND FURTHER THE AFOREMENTIONED. I CALL MY STUDENTS NOT STUDENTS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND THEIR STRENGTHED A THEIR BEAUTY. AND I NEED THEM TO BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES BECAUSE OUR WORLD DOES NOT MAKE THEM FEEL THAT WAY. ABOLITIONIST IS TEACHING MY DUTY. IT'S MY DUTY TO STRUCTURE A CURRICULUM THAT HELP THRUSE ALL KINDS OF ISSUES SUCH AS POLICE BRUTALITY, HOW TO FIGHT IT. AND HOW THEY CAN COME TO TERMS WITH THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MIGHT BE THE NEXT VICTIM OF WHITE SUPREMACY AT ABSOLUTELY NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. TEACHING IN THE RESISTANCE IS INCREDIBLY HARD WORK BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE WE NEED OUR KIDS TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY A PART OF THIS MOVEMENT TO SMASH WHITE SUPREMACY. SO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, HERE'S MY QUESTION FOR YOU. YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT FIGHTING IF THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. BUT HOW WILL YOU WORK WITH OTHERS TO CHANGE THIS SYSTEM THAT HAS BENEFITED CORRUPT SOULS FROM DAY ONE? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I'VE BEEN DOING THIS MY WHOLE CAREER THAT'S HOW I GOT INVOLVED. THIS HAS TO BE A WAKE-UP CALL FOR THE COUNTRY. TAKE ACTION. YOU KNOW, IT'S PAST TIME TO DO THAT. AND IN OUR ECONOMIC INEQUITIES, OUR NATION CAN DO THAT WITH SO MANY PEOPLE. IT STARTS OFF AS YOU DO BECAUSE I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. BUT NEVER TAUGHT YOUNG PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW, THE FIRST THING IS TO TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT, TREAT THEM WITH DIGNITY. TELL THEM ABOUT KEEP HOLDING THEIR HEAD UP HIGH. NOT ONLY THEN, BUT , REMINDING THEM THAT THEY CAN DO ANYTHING AT ALL, ANYTHING AT ALL EXCEPT FOR , I'M GOING TO FIGHT EVERY DAY FOR THE CHANGES THAT I'VE REFERENCED. BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO LISTEN. I LAID OUT THE INITIAL PROCESS SO THEY CAN LEAD TO TAKE ON REAL POLICE REFORM FOR ALL COPS TO HIGHER STANDARDS. SO MANY KNOW NOW. YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HEARD AND THOSE YOUNG STUDENTS YOU MAY HAVE IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, THEY FIND OUT THEY HAVE A MOM OR DAD TREATED UNFAIRLY OR MAYBE EVEN FAIRLY BUT INCARCERATED. AND WHEN THEY GET OUT OF SCHOOL, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY GET OUT OF PRISON? WHAT HAPPENS? THEY'RE TREATED AS IF THEY'RE STILL IN PRISON. NOT LIKE IT IS PUNISHMENT. NO ONE SHOULD GO TO JAIL FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE ABUSE OF DRUGS. GO REHAB YOURSELF. REHABILITATING THEM. WE NEED TO DO THAN JUST REFORM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE INEQUITIES. AFTER TAKING CARE OF EDUCATION, OUR ECONOMY AND OUR HEALTHCARE. I'M GOING TO FIGHT THE DEADLY HEALTHCARE ISSUES INCLUDING COVID-19 BY EXPANDING THE CARE. SO THEY DON'T SEE YOUR PARENT'S FAMILY AND CAN'T GO FOR A TEST BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD IT. WELL, I'M REALLY FEELING SUCK, BUT I'M AFRAID IF I GO IT'S GOING TO , FOR FASTEST UNIVERSAL SCARE EXPAND OBAMACARE AND A DETAILED WAY TO DO IT. I'M GOING TO DOUBLE THE FUNDING FOR HEALTH CENTERS. ON THE VITAL FRONT LINES. MAKING ALL TESTING AND TREATMENT VACCINE FOR ANYONE , AND THE FIGHT TO GIVE EVERY CHILD , I REALLY WANT TO KNOW THIS BECAUSE IN ALL THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE COME UP WITH SO MANY STARTING NEW WEBSITES. YOU'VE GOT 40% OF A CHILD'S BRAIN IS DEVELOPED BY TIME THEY'RE 3. PROVIDING UNIVERSAL PRE-K INCREASES 58% THE CHANCE OF THEM DOING WELL ALL THE WAY THROUGH SCHOOL. TRIPLING TITLE ONE FUNDING TO CLOSE THAT GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR. MAKING PUBLIC COMMENTS FREE FOR EVERY FAMILY EARNING LESS THAN $125,000 A YEAR. I PROPOSE WE GET $75 BILLION THROUGH HBC BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF FUNDING TO COMPETE THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. WE WILL PROVIDE STIMULUS MONEY TO SMALL BUSINESSES. YOU ALL KNOW BETTER THAN I DO. BUT I KNOW PRETTY DARN WELL THAT A COMMUNITY , COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY POOR COMMUNITY, LATINO OR IN THAT COMMUNITY THEY HAVE THE LOCAL HARDWARE STORE, THE LOCAL DRUGSTORE, THE LOCAL SUPERMARKET. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS UNDER THIS UNFAIR RECOVERY THAT TRUMP IS RUNNING, THEY'RE NOT DOING WHAT THEY , WHAT THEY WANT THEM TO DO. PROVIDE SMALL BUSINESS MONEY FOR THOSE WITH FEWER BUSINESSES. SO THEY CAN STAY OPEN. THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE LONES. THEY SHOULD BE GETTING IT. IN THIS SMALL INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY AND THAT IT GENERATES SELF-AWARENESS, GENERATES COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW, AND THESE ARE BIG THINGS. BUT IF EVERYBODY WAS SAYING IT'S TIME FOR BIG CHANGE NOW, WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS AT LEAST AN ACTION TO REVERSE SYSTEMIC RACISM WITH LONG OVERDUE CONCRETE CHANGE. BUT WE CAN DO IT. BECAUSE ONE THING, WE REACHED , AND THAT IS THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE INFLECTION POINTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHERE SOMETHING HAPPENS AND BIG CHANGES OCCUR. WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN THIS COVID VIRUS AND SO MANY PEOPLE AFFECTED BY IT. SO MANY PEOPLE UNNECESSARILY DIED BECAUSE OF IT BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE ARE REALIZING, OH, MY GOD, WHO HAS BEEN CARRYING US ON OUR BACK? ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WHO ARE THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. OVERWHELMINGLY BLACK, LATINO. AND THEY'RE GETTING PAID $5, $6, $7 AN HOUR. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO STAY HOME. THEY'VE BEEN CARRYING US ON THEIR BACK. I THINK THE PUBLIC IS READY. IT'S LIKE THEY'VE HAD THEIR BLINDERS TAKEN OFF. BUT OH, MY GOD, THIS REALLY HAPPENED? IT'S REALLY THIS WAY? AND I THINK I'VE MET , I'VE SPENT TIME WITH THE FORD FAMILY , FLOYD FAMILY. I CAN'T BREATHE. I CAN'T BREATHE. MAMA. MAMA. WHAT HAPPENED WAS, THE WHOLE WORLD SAW IT AND THEY JUST DIDN'T HEAR IT. THEY SAW IT. THEY SAW IT. THEY SAW HIS FACE SMASHED UP AGAINST THE CURVE. THEY SAW HIM HOLDING THERE FOR A TOTAL EIGHT MINUTES AND 26 SECONDS. THEY SAW IT. AND THEY SAID OH, MY GOD. WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT. WE'RE GOING CHANGE IT IN A BIG WAY. LAST THING I'LL SAY, AS A KID, I USED TO STUTTER A LOT. SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A VICTIM OF SYSTEMIC RACISM. BUT I TELL YOU ONE THING DON'T DO, DON'T EVER TALK DOWN TO THESE KIDS. AND THEY TELL ME , I'M SORRY, DON'T FINISH MY SENTENCE. THESE KIDS ARE CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING ANYBODY ELSE CAN DO. LET'S NOT DUMB IT DOWN. THEY'RE INCREDIBLY CAPABLE. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THOSE SCHOOLS THEY HAVE THESE PLACEMENT COURSE AS WELL. CHILDREN TEND TO TURN OUT TO BE WHAT YOU EXPECT OF THEM. LET'S SHOW THEM THE LOVE AND RESPECT, AND , AND THE SUPPORT. YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE THEIR PARENTS MORE ECONOMIC POWER. A LOT MORE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. WE CAN DO THIS. THANK YOU FOR YOU. THANK YOU. , FOR QUOICE FOR THAT IMPORTANT QUESTION. WE GOT THAT FROM A LOT OF DELEGATES. AND THANK YOU FOR REPRESENTING THE , THE IMPORTANCE OF LIFTING THAT UP. AND THANK YOU VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM ONE OF OUR EDUCATION SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS IN MICHIGAN. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE TEACHERS, WE ARE SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS, WE ARE COLLEGE STAFF, AND FACULTY, AND SO THIS IS ONE OF WHAT WE CALL ESP'S, EDUCATION SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. YOU KNOW, SHE HAS FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH OUR VERY UNQUALIFIED SECRETARY OF EDUCATION BETSY DEVOS. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO PAULA MCCONNELL WHO IS A PARA PROFESSIONAL IN THE UTICA SCHOOL DISTRICT. PAULA, YOU NOW HAVE THE EAR OF THE VICE PRESIDENT. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK? THANK YOU, PRESIDENT MILLY. GOOD AFTERNOON, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN MY NAME IS PAULA MCCONNELL. I AM FROM MCHOME COUNTY IN THE GREAT LAKE STATE OF MICHIGAN. I'VE BEEN A PARA EDUCATOR FOR OVER 30 YEARS IN UTICA COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. IN THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC, WE AS EDUCATORS HAVE SOME CONCERNS. WE WANT PRESIDENT TRUMP , SEE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP PUSHING THROUGH YOU THE IMMEDIATE OPENING OF SCHOOLS AND THE HIGHLY UNQUALIFY BETSY DEVOS EITHER HAS NOTHING TO SAY OR IS GIVING SCARCE PUBLIC SCHOOL HOURS TO PRIVATE EDUCATION AND WE FACE AN ECONOMIC CRISIS TO THREATEN FUNDING WHICH PUTS EDUCATORS AT RISK. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY TO EDUCATORS AND PARENTS WHO ARE SO DESPERATE FOR LEADERSHIP ON THESE ISSUES BUT FIND NONE WITH THE PRESENTED A MINISTRATION. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: YOU KNOW, TO PARRA PHRASE TEDDY ROOSEVELT. HE SAID THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN HANDLE BAD NEWS, BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT TO THEM STRAIGHT. THAT HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT IS NOW. AMERICANS HAVE SEEN THIS. IT'S COME TIME TO GET HIS ACT TOGETHER TO BEAT THIS VIRUS. BUT HE SQUANDERED THAT SACRIFICE AND IT'S ALL ABOUT HIM. THINK ABOUT IT. HE THINKS THE PRESIDENCY IS ABOUT HIM. IT DOESN'T HAVE A DAMN THING TO DO ABOUT HIM. IT'S ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. FIRST OF ALL, IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT TO TELL THE TRUTH OCCASIONALLY. WE'LL DO THE WORK. BUT WHO'S GOING TO LEAD? WE NEED A PLAN. I'VE OUTLINED THE KEY STEPS FOR REOPENING SAFELY INCLUDING BY OPENING CHILDCARE AND SCHOOLS REOPEN. PARENTS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TRUST THEIR KIDS ARE SAFE WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK WHEN THAT OCCURS. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STEPS TO REOPENING THE ENTIRE ECONOMY. EDUCATORS MAKE TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES. THEY'VE DONE THE HARD WORK TO MAKE THE SHIFT OF ONLINE LEARNING. IT'S NOT THE EDUCATOR'S FAULT BECAUSE THEY COME FROM POOR FAMILIES AND BECAUSE MANY PLACES DON'T HAVE , BUT THE LONGER THE SCHOOL CLOSED THE CLASSES ARE REMOTE, THE MORE STUDENTS ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR FALL BEHIND. I WOULD POSSIBLY LIES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE THE STEP ONE, PROVIDE FOR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN. MAKE SURE STATES AND DISTRICTS HAVE THE FUNDING TO KEEP EDUCATORS ON THE JOB IN THE MIDST OF THIS CRISIS. BOOST FEDERAL FUNDING TO COVER THE COST OF P.P.E., REDESIGN CLASSROOMSINGS ALL THE THINGS SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO NEED TO DO TO REOPEN AND OPEN WITH NORMALITY. SCALE RESEARCH AND HOW COVID AFFECTS CHILDREN. HELP UNDERSTAND HOW THE VIRUS AFFECTS CHILDREN AND CREATE EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDANCE. BUILD A SAFER SCHOOL BEST PRACTICE CLEARINGHOUSE. AND TO HELP SCHOOL AND SCHOOL BOARDS AND CHILDREN AND CHILDCARE PROVIDERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD TO SHARE INFORMATION APPROACHES AND PAUSE FOR REOPENING. WORK WITH CHILDCARE PROVIDERS. UNION, COMMUNITY AND FAMILIES ON HOW TO REOPEN SAFELY. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE ARE NOT 50 DIFFERENT NATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND TERRITORIES, BEYOND THAT TERRITORIES. WE ARE , WE ARE ONE NATION. ONE NATION. AND WE ACT AND , AND THE WAY THE PRESIDENT TRIES TO TURN THIS INTO ALL SOME KIND OF RACIAL CONTEST ABOUT, I THINK IT JUST , IT'S , IT'S IMMORAL. WE HAVE TO HAVE A CLEAR MESSAGE BASED ON SCIENCE, BASED ON WHAT THE EXPERTS TELL US. AND BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE ALLOW TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE INPUT AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE FIELD, IN THE CLASSROOM, IN THE BUILDINGS DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM. LOOK, EVEN WHEN YOU GET THERE, WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO TEST AND TRACE WHICH DOESN'T EXIST VERY MUCH IN THE COUNTRY, HOW ABOUT A PRESIDENT THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW, STOP THE TESTING, IT'S SHOWING TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE IT? STOP THE TESTING? YOU'RE DOING TOO MUCH. HE SAID SLOW IT DOWN. WHAT IN GOD'S , THIS IS NOT ABOUT HIM. THIS IS ABOUT THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF OUR PEOPLE. AND PARENTS INCLUDING TEACHERS ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK UNTIL THEY'RE SURE THEIR CHILDREN COME AND ONE SOUL WHO IS 1-3 YEARS OLD ARE ABLE TO BE TAKEN CARE SAFELY. WE CAN DO IT. THE PUBLIC IS READY TO PAY FOR IT. IT WILL INCREASE PRODUCTIVE ANY THIS COUNTRY. IT WILL INCREASE SALARY AND INCREASE THE BENEFITS OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY. THANK YOU YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, PAULA. AND THANK YOU, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WE HAVE ONE YOU MORE QUESTION FOR YOU. OUR FINAL EDUCATOR COMES FROM ENOLA, PENNSYLVANIA JUST OUTSIDE OF HARRISBURG. WE PICKED PENNSYLVANIA JUST FOR YOU AND NOT BECAUSE OUR VICE PRESIDENT BECKY BRINGLE IS STANDING OVER HERE MAKING NOISE. YES. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. SETTLE DOWN. SETTLE DOWN. SETTLE DOWN. SETTLE DOWN. SETTLE DOWN. GOOD GRIEF. BECKY BRINGLE, I KNOW YOU KNOW BECKY, BUT SHE LIVED IN HARRISBURG FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. JIMBO LAMB, APPARENTLY YOUR GOOD FRIEND, I DID NOT KNOW THAT IS A HIGH SCHOOL MATH TEACHER. JIMBO, YOU ARE ON WITH VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION? I'M A TEACHER IN THE SOUTHERN REGION OF THE PENNSYLVANIA EDUCATION ASSOCIATION FOR 17 YEARS. I APPRECIATE YOU PROVIDING TIME FOR ME TO ASK THIS QUESTION AND FOR LISTENING TO EDUCATORS. TODAY, WE'RE MORE DIVIDED THAN WE HAVE BEEN AT ANY TIME IN MY LIFETIME WHETHER IT IS ABOUT RACIAL JUSTICE, WEARING MASKS OR SIMPLY A PERSON'S RIGHT. AS EDUCATORS, WE TEACH OUR STUDENTS TO BE RESPECTFUL, KIND AND TO WORK WITH OTHERS. BUT OUR LEADERS FAIL TO MODEL THIS BEHAVIOR. SO HERE'S MY QUESTION, AS PRESIDENT, WHAT WILL YOU DO TO HEAR THE VOICES OF ALL AMERICANS NOT JUST THOSE THAT SUPPORT YOUR AGENDA? WELL, JIMBO, I , I'M A PENNSYLVANIA GUY WHO MARRIED A PHILLY GIRL. AND I WAS JUST OUT IN HARRISBURG. I WAS , ANYWAY, LOOK, WHEN I STARTED THE CAMPAIGN OVER A YEAR AGO AND I ANNOUNCED. I SAID ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO IS UNITE THE COUNTRY AND I GOT CLOBBERED BY EVERYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, THE DEMOCRATS. THEY SAID YOU CAN'T UNITE THE COUNTRY. I TELL YOU WHAT, IF WE CAN'T UNITE THE COUNTRY, WE'RE IN DEEP, DEEP, DEEP, DEEP TROUBLE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME. NOT BECAUSE I'M ON IT BECAUSE FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP WILL RUIN THE CHARACTER OF THIS NATION. AND THE CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY IS LITERALLY ON THE BALLOT. LIVES AN LIVELIHOODS AS WELL. I THINK WE'RE FACING A SERIOUS THREAT. WE HAVE TO MEET IT AS ONE COUNTRY. THIS PRESIDENT GIVES US NO DIRECTION. AND PUTS US AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. YOU CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS IN THE NATION. HALF ARE WEARING MASKS. HALF OF THE PLAN. HALF JUST HOPING FOR THE BEST. THIS COUNTRY IS CRYING OUT FOR LEADERSHIP AND FOR HEALING. THAT'S PART OF A PRESIDENT'S JOB TO LEAD, TO LISTEN AND TO HEAL. AND TO LISTEN TO EVERYONE. IT'S TOO PERSONAL AND TOO UGLY. IT WEAKNESS US. IT DISTRACTS US. IT DIVIDES US. IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. AND I REFUSE TO ACCEPT OUR NATION IS PERMANENTLY DIVIDED. IT IS NOT. PRINCIPALS MUST NEVER BE COMPROMISED. BUT COMPROMISE IS NOT A DIRTY WORD. IT'S HOW OUR GOVERNMENT WAS DESIGNED TO WORK. I'VE DONE IT MY WHOLE LIFE. AND SO I'LL DO THIS AS PRESIDENT. BUT THERE ARE TWO REASONS, JIM, I DECIDED TO RUN THIS TIME. YOU KNOW, IF EVERY , IF THE PERFECT PRESIDENT , IF SHE OR HE REQUIRES TO HAVE 10 GREAT ATTRIBUTES, I'VE NOT MET ONE THAT HAS MORE THAN SIX. BUT ALL THE ATTRIBUTES THAT YOU HAVE MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THAT IN HISTORY. THERE ARE TWO THINGS I'VE DONE VERY WELL AT. ONE, NO ONE HAS DOUBTED MY WORD. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS FOR THE PAST DECADES TO DEAL WITH BIG ISSUES. THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT, JIMBO. I NEVER QUESTIONED WHETHER A MAN OR WOMAN'S MOTIVES. I QUESTION THEIR JUDGMENT BUT NOT THEIR MOTIVES. WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED IN 1972, I WAS ONLY 29 YEARS OLD. SO I HAD TO WAIT. MY BIRTHDAY DIDN'T COME UNTIL 17 DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION. I WAS IN WASHINGTON. ON DECEMBER 18. NOW, I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A FIRST RESPONDER WHO SAID, I FELT SO BADLY FOR HIM IN RETROSPECT. HE SAID YOU'VE GOT TO COME HOME. THERE'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT. WHAT HAPPENED? AND THE POOR KID JUST BLURTED OUT, YOUR WIFE IS DEAD. YOUR DAUGHTER'S DEAD AND YOUR TWO BOYS MAY NOT MAKE IT. MY WIFE AND MY DAUGHTER WAS 18 MONTHS OLD. MY SON ALMOST 3. THE OTHER ONE ALMOST 4. THEY WERE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. THE TREE WAS ON TOP OF THE CAR. THEY WERE BROADSIDED BY A TRACTOR-TRAILER AND THEY WERE KILLED. THE TWO BOYS MADE IT. SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS I DECIDE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR. AND MY BROTHER JIMBO, , WHEN I WAS A KID WE CALLED HIM JIMBO. HIS NAME IS JAMES. WELL, JIMBO IS FIVE AND A HALF YEARS YOUNGER. RAISED ALL OUR MONEY, THE KIDDIE CAMPAIGN WE HAD. BUT THE STATE COULD ALWAYS GET ANOTHER SENATOR. MY KIDS COULDN'T GET ANOTHER DAD. AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS SENATORS AND THEY SAID YOU'VE GOT TO RUN. YOU'VE GOT TO BE SWORN IN. AND IN RETROSPECT, THEY SAVED MY SANITY. JUST STAYED FOR SIX MONTHS. JUST STAYED FOR SIX MONTHS. I'LL NEVER FORGET, THE SENATOR SAYING, ONLY 1702 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SWORN INTO THE SENATE. YOUR WIFE WORKED SO HARD TO GET YOU ELECTED. YOU OWE IT TO YOUR FAMILY. SO I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO SWORN IN. I DECIDED NOT TO GO. WELL, THE NEXT DAY, I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL WITH MY SON, AND THEY SENT UP THE SEX E SECRETARY OF THE SENATE WHO SWORE ME INTO THE , SENT UP THE SECRETARY OF THE SENATE WHO SWORE ME IN THE HOSPITAL. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAD TO DO WAS I HAD TO MEET WITH MAJORITY LEADER AT 2:00 DEPENDING ON THE WEEK ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON. AND I GET AN ASSIGNMENT FROM THE LEADER, MIKE MASS FROM MONTANA. I THOUGHT ALL SENATORS GOT ASSIGNMENTS. NO SENATORS GET ASSIGNMENTS. MATTER OF FACT I'M THE FIRST SENATOR I EVER KNEW I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER. TOOK ME ABOUT FIVE, SIX WEEKS, TO TAKE ME PULSE TO THE SEE HOW I WAS EMOTIONALLY. SO WE WALK IN. JUST BEFORE 2:00, WALKED DOWN FROM BELOW THE SENATE. WALKED OUT THERE, THERE WERE NO LEADERS AND I HAD MY MEETING. THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENS IS I WALK IN THE DOOR, AND TWO FRIENDS OF MINE, ONE BECAME A GREAT FRIEND AND STILL IS BOB DOFMENTE AND THE OTHER WAS TEDDY KENNEDY. THEY INTRODUCED THE DISABILITIES ACT. AND A PARTICULAR SENATOR GOT ELECTED WHO DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A HEART I THOUGHT. WAS ON THE FLOOR JUST SAYING , THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT TAXPAYERS SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR LIVES ON THE BUSES. BUT I HAD TO GO OFF AND HAVE MY MEETING. I HAD TO IS IT ACROSS THE DESK WHAT'S THE MATTER, JOE? AND I THEN WENT OFF TO THE STORY SAYING THERE WAS NO SOCIAL REDEEMING VALUE, NO HEART, ETC., ETC. JOE, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I TOLD YOU THAT SENATOR AND HIS WIFE WERE SITTING IN YOUR HOME IN DECEMBER 1970? THIS IS NOW MAY OF 1973. 1970. AND HE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN OUR STATEWIDE NEWSPAPER. THAT'S HIM EMBRACING ME UNDER HIS ARM WITH TWO STEEL CRUTCHES. . HE LOOKED OUT AND SAID ALL I WANT FROM CHRISTMAS IS FOR SOMEONE TO LOVE ME AND TAKE ME HOME. I SAID WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THAT I ADOPTED THAT YOUNG MAN? I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING. HE SAID OVER MY YEARS , HE SAID IT'S ALWAYS PROPERTY THE QUESTION OF A MAN OR WOMAN. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. AND ONCE YOU QUESTION YOUR MOTIVE YOU CAN NEVER DO THAT. IF I SAY YOUR IN THE POCK OF OR THISED A THAT AND BY THE WAY LET'S HAVE AN EDUCATION BILL, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WORK WITH ME. SO I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. THEY DON'T QUESTION MOTIVE. THE OTHER AREAS THEIR GOING TO INHERIT A WORLD OF IN DISAWRY. MY WHOLE CAREER IT'S BEEN ON NATIONAL SECURITY. AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS NOW. AND THE REASON I'M RUNNING THAT'S WHY I THINK, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT FLYING. MANY REPUBLICAN SENATORS OR COUNCIL MEMBERS WOULD TELL YOU , I THINK THERE'S A LOT WE CAN AGREE ON. WITH TRUMP OUT OF THE WAY, THAT'S SOME OF THE PROBLEMS OUT THERE. PARTICULARLY PROBLEMS IN EDUCATION. ALL THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE TOUGH NOW. THAT'S WHY I CAN GET SO MUCH DONE. LOOK , WE ALWAYS HAVE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO PEEL BACK. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO OPEN OUR DOORS AND OUR EARS AND OUR HEARTS. I'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NEED NOBODY OUT. THEY NEED EACH OF US TO DO THAT IN OUR COUNTRY. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU THANKED SOMEBODY? WHEN IS THE LAST TIME, YOU SAID THANK YOU? DID YOU YOU GO TO HIM OR HER AND SAY THANK YOU. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SAID, CAN I HELP YOU? IT HAPPEN ONE PERSON AT A TIME. YOU CHALLENGE OTHERS. TRIED IT WITH MY MOM AND YOU WALK A MILE. WE CAN DISAGREE, BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE DISAGREEABLE. IT'S HOW TOGETHER WE CAN DO THIS. BUT WE HAVE TO TREAT CONCLUDING COMMENT, MY DAD USED TO ALWAYS SAY, JOEY, EVERYBODY , EVERYBODY DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE. NO , DESERVES TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. EVERYBODY DESERVES TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU, JIMBO FOR THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU, PAULA AND TURQUOISE, DELEGATES. WE WANT TO THANK OUR FELLOW DELEGATES WHO WERE ABLE TO CHANNEL THOSE QUESTIONS THAT CAME IN. AND WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE. BUT WE NEEDED TO HEAR FROM YOU, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD BRING TO THIS, AND WE THANK YOU FOR SPENDING THIS TIME WITH US. BEFORE YOU GO, WE WANT TO GIVE YOU JUST A FEW MINUTES. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY FINAL COMMENTS IF YOU ASK THESE DELEGATES FOR THEIR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I'VE BEEN ARGUING A LONG TIME BECAUSE I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO MY WIFE. BY THE WAY, MY DECEASED WIFE WAS A TEACHER AS WELL. EDUCATION SHOULD BE PUT MORE IN THE HANDS OF EDUCATORS. WE SHOULD HAVE MORE INPUT ON WHAT YOU TEACH, HOW YOU TEACH IT, AND WHEN YOU TEACH IT. YOU ARE THE ONES IN THE CLASS ROOMS. YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE INPUT. AND I REALLY MEAN THIS, NOT I'M NOT JUST TRYING TO BE NICE. YOU ARE AND YOU NEED THAT MORE. SO FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS GOING TO BE A MUCH MORE TEACHER CENTRIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE VAST MAJORITY OF MONEY COMES FROM THE STATE. BUT THE PORTION OF FEDERAL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A MAJOR SAY ON WHAT IT'S SPENT AND WHERE IT'S SPENT. NEXT E NEXT THING I WANT TO SAY TO Y'ALL IS THAT , I AM , ONE THING THAT REALLY ALWAYS ANGERED ME IS THE WAY EDUCATED PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE WALKING IN A RECEPTION LINE AND SOMEONE SAYS AND WHAT DO YOU DO BESIDES TEACH , I GO, OH, OK. WHAT DO YOU DO? OH, I TEACH. TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU TEACH. OR I HAVE A START-UP COMPANY. OR I'M IN SALES WITH SUCH AND SUCH. YOU ARE AND I'M NOT JOKING ABOUT THIS YOU ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PROFESSION IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU ARE THE ONES THAT GIVE THEM CONFIDENCE. YOU LET THEM BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES. YOU WERE GOING THAT. AND I PROMISE YOU YOU WILL NEVER FIND AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT WITH WHO IS MORE TEACHER CENTRIC AND MORE SUPPORTIVE THAN ME. JOE, ANY TIME WITHOUT EDUCATORS ARE GOING TO OUTCOMPETE FUSS. IT'S TIME WE RAISED THE GAME TO MAKE YOU THE MANAGERS. THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING ME. AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR ME. I REALLY DO. THANK YOU YOU SO MUCH VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIND. THE PACK RECOMMENDATIONS TO BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE DECISION WILL BE MADE BY MAIL-IN BALLOT. IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO MAIL BALLOTS IN A VERY GOOD WAY. YES, IT IS. WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT. IT WILL COME TO THE HOME OF THESE ALMOST 8,000 DELEGATES AND WE WILL BE COUNTING THOSE AT THE , IN AUGUST. AND SO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU IN OUR HOUSE TODAY. GOD BLESS AND BE SAFE.

THE PRESIDENT, FROM PUBLIC AFFAIRS, AVAILABLE NOW IN PAPERBACK AND E-BOOK. ORGANIZED BY THEIR RANKING, BY HISTORIANS FROM BEST TO WORST. AND A LOOK INTO THE LIVES OF OUR NATION'S CHIEF EXECUTIVES AND LEADERSHIP STYLES. C-SPAN.ORG\/THE PRESIDENT. ORDER YOUR COPY TODAY. WHEREVER BOOKS AND E-BOOKS ARE SOLD. JOE BIDEN WAS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL YESTERDAY IN PENNSYLVANIA, WHERE HE MET WITH VOTERS OUTSIDE HIS CHILDHOOD HOME IN SCRANTON AND TOWARD A NEARBY METALWORKS FACILITY. THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND HIS PLAN FOR REOPENING THE ECONOMY. HELLO, EVERYONE. [APPLAUSE] LET ME START OFF BY SAYING HELLO TO TERESA CASEY AND THE GUY THAT HANGS OUT WITH HER OCCASIONALLY. BOBBY, THANK YOU. THANKS FOR BEING HERE AND FOR WELCOMING ME HOME. I WANT TO THANK THEM ALL. MAYOR BURKE AND MAYOR CARNEGIE, CONGRATULATIONS. MR. PRESIDENT, AS I SAID EARLIER, THE IRONWORKERS HAS BEEN WITH ME MY ENTIRE CAREER. THE FIRST OPERATION TO EVER ENDORSE ME, IN 1972. I WASN'T EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO BE ELECTED SENATOR, AND YOU GUYS ENDORSED ME, AND I WAS ABLE TO TURN 30 BY THE TIME I GOT SWORN IN. AS A TIME I WAS ELECTED I WASN'T OLD ENOUGH. IT IS GREAT TO BE HOME. MY DAD IS FROM DUNMORE, MR. MAYOR, AND MY MOM IS FROM SCRANTON. I WANT TO THANK BOB AND EVERYONE HERE AT MCGREGOR INDUSTRIES FOR SHOWING ME AROUND THIS MORNING. ALTHOUGH I KNEW OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT FOR A LONG TIME, IT HAS ONLY BEEN AROUND A HUNDRED YEARS. THIS IS THE KIND OF SMALL MANUFACTURING BUSINESS THAT DEMONSTRATES THE RESILIENCE TO CREATIVITY AND THE STAYING POWER OF THE AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL BASE. OUR COUNTRY IS FACING THREE SIMULTANEOUS CRISES , A PANDEMIC THAT HAS AFFECTED OVER 3 MILLION AMERICANS, AND THUS FAR OVER 130,000 LIVES. THREE TIMES A WEEK I AM ON THE PHONE WITH NATIONAL FOLKS, THE DOCS WHO ARE HEADS OF THE CDC AND OTHER PLACES BEFORE. THE EXPECTATION IS IT MAY GET AS HIGH AS 200,000 BEFORE IT IS OVER. IT SHOWS NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT HAS LEFT ALMOST 18 MILLION AMERICANS OUT OF WORK, WITH SOME OF THE GREATEST PAIN INFLICTED ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. A NATIONAL RECKONING ON THE ISSUE OF RACIAL INJUSTICE IS ALSO , HAS LONG PLAGUED THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, LONG PLAGUED OUR COUNTRY, HAS COME ON TOP OF A WIDENING ECONOMIC INEQUITY AND A MOUNTING CLIMATE CRISIS. EACH OF THESE CRISES IS AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE THAT HAS TESTED OUR STRENGTHS, OUR PATIENTS, OUR RESILIENCE, AND OUR , OUR PATIENCE, AND A RESILIENCE, AND OUR CORE BALANCE. EACH OF THESE PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE NATION, AN OPPORTUNITY TO PREPARE NOW FOR THE FUTURE THREATS WE KNOW ARE JUST AROUND THE CORNER. AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL INEQUITIES OF OUR NATION, THE GROWING GAP BETWEEN THE VERY WEALTHY AND EVERYONE ELSE. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY AND FULLY LIVE UP TO THE WORDS AND THE VALUES ENSHRINED IN OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS IN THIS NATION. WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL, WE ARE ENTITLED TO BE TREATED EQUALLY FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES. NOT JUST CREATED EQUALLY, BUT TO BE TREATED EQUALLY. ALTHOUGH THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER, THAT IS WHY IT IS NO TIME FOR THE DIVISIVE POLITICS WE ARE HEARING MORE ABOUT TODAY. DONALD TRUMP MAY BELIEVE THAT PITTING AMERICANS AGAINST AMERICANS WILL BENEFIT HIM. I DON'T. WE HAVE A HEALTH CRISIS, AN ECONOMIC CRISIS, A RACIAL JUSTICE CRISIS, A CLIMATE CRISIS. WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO SOLVE THESE CRISES, TO SOLVE THEM AS AMERICANS. THIS IS OUR MOMENT TO IMAGINE AND TO BUILD A NEW AMERICAN ECONOMY FOR OUR FAMILIES AND FOR OUR COMMUNITY. AN ECONOMY FOR EVERY AMERICAN. EVERY AMERICAN HAS A CHANCE TO GET A FAIR RETURN FOR THE WORK THEY PUT IN, AN EQUAL CHANCE TO GET AHEAD. MY GRAND POP WHEN I LIVED WITH HIM, USED TO TALK ABOUT EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY, JOEY, DESERVES A SHOT, JUST A SHOT. EVERYBODY. AN ECONOMY THAT IS MORE POWERFUL WE CAN BUILD PRECISELY BECAUSE EVERYONE WILL BE CUT IN ON THE DEAL THIS TIME. AS WE REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, THIS TIME BRINGING EVERYONE ALONG, EVERYBODY. AN ECONOMY THAT SAYS INVESTING IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WORKING FAMILIES IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NEARLY $2 TRILLION IN TAX BREAK HANDED OUT TO THE SUPER WEALTHY. DONALD TRUMP LOVES TO TALK AND TALK AND TALK. BUT AFTER THREE AND A HALF YEARS OF BIG PROMISES, WHAT DO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TO SHOW FOR ALL THE TALK? HE PROMISED HEALTH CARE PLAN, BUT NEVER EVEN OFFERED HIS OWN BILL AS HE CONTINUES TO TRY TO WIPE OUT OBAMACARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. INSTEAD, HE HAS FOUGHT REPEATEDLY TO TAKE HEALTH CARE AWAY FROM TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE IT BEFORE, AND OVER 100 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE COVERED BECAUSE THEY HAD PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS NOW, THAT THEY COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN COVERAGE FOR BEFORE. HE PROMISED AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN TO DELIVER, DELIVER ON JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES. WE ARE RANKED 23RD IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL OF THAT? HE PROMISED , WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF THAT? HE PROMISED TO BRING BACK JOBS AND MANUFACTURING. HE PROMISED TO , OFF SHORING DOUBLED THE JOBS IN THE FIRST 18 MONTHS. I AM GOING TO CHANGE THAT. WE ARE GOING TO DOUBLE THE TAX ON FOREIGN PROFITS SO WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LEAVE AND BUILD A BROAD. WHEN IT COMES TO COVID-19, AFTER MONTHS OF DOING NOTHING OTHER THAN PREDICTING THE VIRUS WOULD DISAPPEAR, OR MAYBE IF YOU DRANK BLEACH YOU WOULD BE OK, TRUMP HAS SIMPLY GIVEN UP. HE HAS WAIVED THE WHITE FLAG. HE HAS WALKED AWAY. HIS FAILURE HAS COME WITH A TERRIBLE HUMAN COST AND DEEP ECONOMIC TOLL. TIME AND AGAIN, WORKING FAMILIES ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION'S INCOMPETENCE. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO SAY IT AND INCOMPETENCE. SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE ENDED UP WITH THE SHORT END OF THE STICK AS WELL. LESS THAN A THIRD OF THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR STIMULUS THAT THE CONGRESS HAS PASSED AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR , LESS THAN A THIRD OF IT IS GONE TO MAINSTREAM BUSINESSES. BIG BUSINESSES, THE WEALTHY, TRUMP'S CRONIES AND PALS. THEY HAVE BEEN THE BIG WINNERS. SENATOR CASEY CAN TELL YOU , THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, TO MAKE SURE WHERE THAT MONEY WENT. I AM THE GUY THAT HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HANDING OUT $84 BILLION IN THE RECOVERY ACT AND THE FINANCIAL RECESSION. I MET ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS WITH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, EVERYTHING WAS OPEN. WHAT ARE WE FINDING OUT NOW? THAT LARGE CHAINS AND HOTEL CHAINS AND CHAINS OF RESTAURANTS, THEY DIVIDED ALL THE RESTAURANTS UP AND TREATED THEM AS INDIVIDUAL RESTAURANTS. THEY ARE ALREADY MAKING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THE MAINSTREAM MOM AND POP BUSINESSES , THEY DIDN'T GET THE MONEY. THE TRUTH IS THROUGHOUT THIS CRISIS, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ALMOST SINGULARLY FOCUSED ON THE STOCK MARKET, THE DOW, THE NASDAQ. NOT YOU, NOT YOUR FAMILIES. IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL BE LASER FOCUSED ON WORKING FAMILIES. THEY DON'T NEED ME. BUT WORKING FAMILIES DO. AND THIS MAY BE, SHOULD BE IN MY VIEW, THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE. WE MUST REWARD WORK AS MUCH AS WE REWARD WELL. BUT NOW WE JUST REWARD EXCESSIVE WEALTH. GROWING UP RICH AND LOOKING DOWN ON PEOPLE IS A BIT DIFFERENT THAN HOW I GREW UP UP HERE. HERE NOBODY THOUGHT AND UNDERSTOOD, NOBODY THOUGHT BUT ALSO KNEW THAT WALL STREET BANKERS AND CEO'S DIDN'T BUILD THIS COUNTRY, DIDN'T BUILD IT. YOU CAN JUST LOOK AROUND YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. AT THE KITCHEN TABLE, AND SEE WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY. I WAS AT MY GRANDFATHER FINNEGAN'S KITCHEN TABLE WHERE I LEARNED THAT MONEY DOES NOT DETERMINE YOUR WORTH. HE WOULD SAY, JOEY, NO ONE IN THE WORLD IS MORE WORTHY THAN YOU, AND EVERYONE IS EQUALLY WORTHY. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, AND PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW ME, HE MEANT IT, AND I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT AS WELL AS I HAVE THE LAST 15 YEARS. HE SAID, \"JOEY, A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, IT IS ABOUT RESPECT, IT IS ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. IT IS BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK, AND MEAN IT.\" MR. PRESIDENT, OVER 56% OF THE PEOPLE THINK THEIR KIDS WILL NEVER REACH THE STANDARD OF LIVING THEY HAD. FOLKS, WE KNOW WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY. HARD-WORKING FOLKS LIKE YOU GREW UP WITH. YOU KNOW WHO BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS? UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE A MIDDLE-CLASS. SAYING JOEY, YOUR LABOR , I HAVE TAKEN PRIDE IN THAT. THE ONLY WAY MY DAD WOULD SAY YOU DO WITH POWER IS WITH POWER. WITH POWER. IN CORPORATE AMERICA , AND I COME FROM THE CORPORATE STATE OF THE WORLD, DELAWARE , THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH ABUSE OF POWER IS WITH POWER. AND LABOR UNIONS. THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE THAT CAPACITY TO DO IT. IF THAT IS RAIN OUTSIDE, COME ON IN, GUYS. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY OUT THERE. ARE YOU GUYS IN THE RAIN? OR IS THAT NOT RAIN? I THOUGHT THAT WAS RAIN. IT IS? YOU GUYS CAN COME ON IN. DON'T STAY OUT THERE. LOOK, DETERMINATION, RESILIENCE, AND GRIT. GET UP NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN. RESPECT FOR HARD WORK AND FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO IT. THESE ARE THE VALUES I GREW UP WITH AND ALL OF YOU HAVE GROWN UP WITH. THESE ARE THE VALUES THAT I AM GOING TO TAKE WITH ME TO THE OVAL OFFICE. I WILL GIVE MORE HELP TO MAINSTREAM BUSINESS AND TRIP INDOORS , AND ENTREPRENEURS. HALF OF THE JOBS IN AMERICA ARE SMALL BUSINESS JOBS. BACK AS EARLY AS MAY, SOME ESTIMATES FOUND THAT MORE THAN 100,000 SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN. MORE HAVE CLOSED, AND IT HAS BEEN DEVASTATING. SO ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. IT IS TIME TO REVERSE THE PRIORITIES IN THIS COUNTRY. TIME TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. HELPING FOLKS MANAGE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE PANDEMIC. LET'S HELP BILLIONS OF WOULD-BE ENTREPRENEURS TO GET OUT FROM UNDER THEIR ASKS SO THEY CAN START BUSINESSES , UNDER THEIR DESKS SO THEY CAN START BUSINESSES. AND IT IS TIME AMERICA PAY ITS FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. WE SAW IN OUR ADMINISTRATION THAT WE SHOULD LOWER THE TAXES TO 28%, AND IT WAS LOWERED TO 21%. I'M GOING TO RAISE IT BACK TO 28%, PROVIDE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THE DAYS OF AMAZON NOT PAYING FEDERAL INCOME TAX WILL BE OVER. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS HAVE THE POWER AND THE VOICE. IT IS WAY PAST TIME , SHAREHOLDER CAPITALISM. THE ONLY RESPONSIBILITY A CORPORATION HAS IS TO SHAREHOLDERS. THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. IT IS A FARCE. THEY HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR WORKERS, TO THE COMMUNITY, TO THEIR COUNTRY. THAT IS A NEWER, RADICAL NOTION. , THAT IS NOT A NEWER, RADICAL NOTION. NOW THE CHALLENGE IS TO TAKE THESE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES AND APPLY THEM TO THE NEW ECONOMY. WE HAVE TO BUILD IN THE YEARS AHEAD. AND, FOLKS, IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO BUILD BACK. WE HAVE TO BUILD BACK BETTER. THAT IS WHAT MY PLAN IS, TO BUILD BACK BETTER. IT IS BOLD, IT IS PRACTICAL, AND IT IS FOCUSED ON BUILDING AN ECONOMY FOR THE FUTURE, NOT FOR THE PAST. AND THE RESPONSE TO THE FIVE TRUTHS LAID OUT IN THE MOMENT OF CRISIS. THE FIRST IS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE COURSE OF THIS PANDEMIC THAT WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR INDUSTRIAL BASE AS LONG-TERM SOURCES OF MIDDLE-CLASS JOB CREATION. LET'S USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE BOLD INVESTMENTS IN INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION SO THE FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA. ALL IN AMERICA. I DO NOT ACCEPT THE DEFEAT THAT FORECASTED AUTOMATION AND GLOBALIZATION MEANS WE CANNOT KEEP WELL-PAYING JOBS HERE IN AMERICA AND CREATE MORE OF THEM. I DO NOT BUY FOR ONE SECOND THAT THE VITALITY OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURING IS A THING OF THE PAST. AMERICAN MANUFACTURING WAS WITH THE FUNCTION AND ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY IN WORLD WAR II, HAS TO BE PART OF THE ENGINE OF NEW PROSPERITY IN AMERICA NOW. SO TODAY, I AM RELEASING A BLUEPRINT, HOW TO CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS, BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE NEED NOW AND WE WILL NEED IN THE FUTURE. AND IT STARTS WITH A PRETTY BASIC IDEA. WHEN WE SPEND TAXPAYERS MONEY, WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDS TAXPAYERS MONEY, SHOULD USE IT TO BUY AMERICAN PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT AMERICAN JOBS. MY PLAN WOULD TIGHTEN THE RULES TO MAKE THIS A REALITY, AND IT GOES FURTHER. DURING MY FIRST TERM ALONE, WE WILL INVEST $400 BILLION IN PURCHASING PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS OUR COUNTRY NEEDS TO MODERNIZE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, REPLENISH OUR CRITICAL STOCKPILES, ENHANCE NATIONAL SECURITY. THAT IS HOW MUCH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL SPEND ON BUYING PRODUCTS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THESE FUNDS WILL PROVIDE RELIABLE, PREDICTABLE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS MADE BY AMERICAN WORKERS, AND SUPPLY CHAINS LIKE THIS ONE RIGHT HERE, FURRY AMERICAN INDUSTRIES. WE WILL PURCHASE CLEAN , FOR AMERICAN INDUSTRIES. WE WILL PURCHASE CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES, STOCKPILES OF CRITICAL GOODS AND EQUIPMENT, AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, TO MODERNIZE OUR GOVERNMENT AND ENHANCE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. TO ENSURE THE FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA, WE NEED TO WIN NOT JUST THE JOBS OF TODAY BUT WE HAVE TO INVEST IN THE JOBS OF TOMORROW, WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE. THE CHINESE ARE SPENDING MULTIPLE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO OWN THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE FUTURE, WHILE WE SIT WITH HER THUMB IN OUR EAR. IT MEANS FIGHTING UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES, CURBING THE THREAT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BY COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA. AMERICA CANNOT SIT ON THE SIDELINES IN THE RACE FOR THE FUTURE. THAT'S WHY I AM POSING A DRAMATIC RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF $300 BILLION TO SHARPEN AMERICANS' COMPETITIVE EDGE IN NEW INDUSTRIES WHERE GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IS UP FOR GRABS, LIKE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, BIOTECHNOLOGY, CLEAN ENERGY. THAT IS THE FUTURE. AND THIS MONEY WILL BE USED PURPOSEFULLY TO ENSURE ALL OF AMERICANS ARE IN ON THE DEAL, INCLUDING COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LEFT OUT. BLACK, BROWN, NATIVE AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS, CITIES AND TOWNS EVERYWHERE IN THE REGION AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ALL TOLD, THIS WILL BE A MOBILIZATION OF R&D INVESTMENT IN A WAY NOT SEEN SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND WORLD WAR II. THE TRADITION OF BRINGING BACK TO JOBS HAS BEEN LOST THIS YEAR. MY PLAN WILL CREATE AT LEAST 5 MILLION NEW, GOOD PAYING JOBS. AS EXPERTS HAVE LOOKED AT IT, IN MANUFACTURING AND INNOVATION. CREATED THEM RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE SECOND THING WE HAVE SEEN, IN THE IMPORTANCE OF A MORE RESILIENT ECONOMY IN THE LONG TERM, OUR PRESIDENT WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THIS PANDEMIC. HE IGNORED THE DETAILED BRIEFINGS AND WARNINGS THAT OUR ADMINISTRATION LEFT BEHIND. THE THREAT OF A PANDEMIC, WE TOLD HIM, WAS COMING. WE GAVE ALL THIS TO HIS ADMINISTRATION IN TRANSITION. BUT HE SHUT IT ALL DOWN. HE SHUT DOWN THE PANDEMIC OFFICE WE HAD INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. HE PRAISED THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT EVEN AS THE VIRUS WAS COMING TO OUR SHORES BECAUSE HE WAS SO AFRAID THAT THEY WOULD WALK AWAY FROM HIS TRADE DEAL THAT COST US SIGNIFICANCE ABOUT , SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AS WELL. LET'S NOT GET CAUGHT FLAT-FOOTED AGAIN. LET'S MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THAT MEANS INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE, CREATING CLEAN ENERGY AND UNION JOBS IN THE PROCESS. NEXT WEEK I WILL TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN BUILD A MODEL MODERN, SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND A CLEAN ECONOMY, AND THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT SUFFER THE MOST FROM POLLUTION ARE THE FIRST TO BENEFIT FROM THIS INVESTMENT. THIRD THING, WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS PANDEMIC THE IMMENSE BURDEN ON WORKING PARENTS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN WHO ARE CARRYING AS IF THEY , THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE WORKING, THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO WORK. THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN WHO ARE YOUNG. AT THE SAME TIME THEIR PARENTS ARE AGING AND SUFFERING FROM DISABILITIES. IT HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY HARD DURING THIS CRISIS. LET'S FACE IT, IT IS ALWAYS HARD. SO LET'S MAKE IT EASIER TO AFFORD CHILDCARE AND CARE FOR OUR AGING RELATIVES AND OUR MOMS AND OUR DADS. LET'S OFFER MORE PAY, MORE ECONOMIC DIGNITY TO MILLIONS OF WORKERS, TO OFFER WOMEN OF COLOR WHO ARE ENTRUSTED TO TAKE CARE OF OUR YOUNGEST AND OUR OLDEST AT THE SAME TIME. DONALD TRUMP HAS NO IDEA WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE A SINGLE PARENT, BARELY GETTING BY. HE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO PROVIDE FOR AN AGING PARENT. THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE THAT HE DOESN'T EVEN TRY TO UNDERSTAND OR EMPATHIZE WITH THE STRUGGLING OF SO MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. LIKE A LOT OF YOU , AND I WILL BET THERE IS A LOT OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE, INCLUDING THE PRESS , YOU UNDERSTAND IT PERSONALLY. I UNDERSTAND IT. I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO BE A SINGLE DAD WHO HAS TO WORK WITH TWO YOUNG SONS AT HOME. I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BRING YOUR AGING PARENTS INTO YOUR HOME IN THE LAST MONTHS OF THEIR LIVES TO CARE FOR THEM AS WELL. I HAVE DONE BOTH, AND I HAD GREAT HELP. I HAVE A REALLY CLOSE FAMILY. I WAS A U.S. SENATOR MAKING $42,000 A YEAR AT THE TIME. IT IS HARD, BUT IT IS SO MUCH HARDER FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. IN THE WEEK AHEAD, I WILL LAY OUT A PLAN TO MOBILIZE AMERICAN TALENT AND HEART TO BUILD EIGHT WHEN HE FIRST CENTURY CAREGIVING AND EDUCATION WORKFORCE. THE FOURTH THING WE HAVE SEEN IS MILLIONS OF AMERICAN WORKERS IN SMALL BUSINESSES, BUSINESS OWNERS, PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO KEEP THE COUNTY , THEIR COUNTRY GOING. WE NEED TO TREAT THESE FOLKS AND THEIR FAMILIES AS ESSENTIAL, NOT JUST IN TIMES OF CRISIS BUT ALL TIMES. WE CALL THESE FOLKS THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. I THINK THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE BULK OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD TO STAY-AT-HOME AND STAY IN PLACE, THEY LOOK OUT AND THEY REALIZE THERE IS THAT GROCERY STORE CLERK STACKING THE SHELVES, THAT NURSES AID TRYING TO PUT ON PROTECTIVE GEAR TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE ON A VENTILATOR. THAT TRUCK DRIVER WHO HAS HAD MAIL DELIVERED, THE WORKERS THAT SEE THESE , THE FIRST RESPONDERS. IT IS TIME WE PAY THEM. THE IDEA THAT EVERY ONE OF THEM IS NOT WORTH AT LEAST $15 AN HOUR, OR SPEND TIME WITH FRONT-LINE WORKERS AND THEN TELL THEM THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE, BECOME PART OF THE UNION, ORGANIZE FOR BETTER PAY, FOR PAID LEAVE, FOR BENEFITS, FOR WORKING CONDITIONS WHERE WE INSIST THAT THEY HAVE SAFE AND SANITARY CONDITIONS TO WORK IN. MAYBE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO IGNORE IT, BUT I CAN'T AND I WON'T. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT TO PRAISE THESE WORKERS, WE NEED TO PAY THEM. LET'S FINISH THE JOB OF OBAMACARE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. LET'S PROVIDE PUBLIC AUCTIONS TO COVER THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE BY ADDING IT TO OBAMACARE. LET'S ENSURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO A GOOD EDUCATION, REGARDLESS OF ZIP CODE. LET'S TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE SPEND ON TITLE I SCHOOLS. AND YOU HAVE 18 OF THEM. 18 TITLE I SCHOOLS IN SCRANTON AND DUNMORE. AND IT MEANS THEY HAVE A VERY LOW TAX BASIS, SO THEY HAVE TROUBLE KEEPING TEACHERS. I TRIPLED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPEND ON THOSE FROM $15 BILLION A YEAR TO $45 BILLION. MAKING SURE EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY CHILD AGE 3, 4, AND FIVE, IS ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL, NOT DAYCARE. ALL THE STUDIES SHOW WHETHER IT IS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA OR ANYWHERE AROUND THAT THAT INCREASES OVER 58% CHANCE THAT THAT CHILD WILL GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND GRADUATE WITHOUT HAVING ANY TROUBLE. IMAGINE WHAT A BIG DIFFERENCE IT WILL MAKE. I THINK BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC , EVERYONE HAS RENEWED APPRECIATION FOR HOW HARD OUT FUTURES WORK, HOW IMPORTANT THEIR JOB IS. SO LET'S KEEP THEM WITH THE RESOURCES HAVE THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. LET'S PAY THEM. THESE ARE NOT SOMEBODY ELSE'S CHILDREN, THEY ARE ALL OUR CHILDREN. THEY ARE THE CHILDREN , THOSE CHILDREN ARE THE KITE STRINGS THAT HOLD OUR NATIONAL AMBITIONS ALOFT, AND OUR TEACHERS ARE CRITICAL. FINALLY WE HAVE SEEN WITH HORRIFYING CLARITY THE COST OF SYSTEMIC RACISM, THE NEED FOR CONFERENCE OF AGENDA, FOR RACIAL EQUALITY IN OUR COUNTRY. IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT POLICE REFORM, IT IS ABOUT DEALING WITH THE DEEP WOUND OF SYSTEMIC RACISM IN THIS NATION. SO WE NEED A DEDICATED AGENDA TO CLOSE THE WEALTH GAP, EXPAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING, INVEST IN BROWN AND BLACK AND A API NATIVE AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS. MAKE REAL THE PROMISE OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. FOR TOO LONG, THE BATTLE FOR RACIAL EQUALITY HAS DIVIDED AMERICA. IT SHOULD BE USED NOW TO UNITE US. NOW TRUMP CYNICALLY CLAIMS HE IS DEFENDING AMERICANS HERITAGE BY EMBRACING THE CONFEDERATE FLAG AND PUBLIC MONUMENTS OF GENERALS WHO REBELLED AGAINST , WERE TREASONOUS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO PERMANENTLY RIP THIS NATION APART. YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS ANY IDEA THAT 360,000 PENNSYLVANIANS WHO FOUGHT ON THE SIDE OF THE UNION TO DEFEAT THE FLAG, THAT CONFEDERATE FLAG, INCLUDING MORE BLACK SOLDIERS COMING FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION? DO YOU THINK HE HAS ANY CLUE THAT 33,000 PENNSYLVANIANS DIED IN THE CIVIL WAR, FIGHTING AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT FLAG STOOD FOR? I SEE A DIFFERENT AMERICA THAN TRUMP, ONE THAT DESPITE ALL OF OUR SHORTCOMINGS AND FAILINGS IS STILL COME AFTER MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES, DEDICATED , IS STILL, AFTER TWO CENTURIES, IS DEDICATED TO QUALITY AND INTEGRITY. WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER IN THIS COUNTRY TO SOLVE IT. I GOT CRITICIZED DURING THE PRIMARIES FOR SAYING I WAS RUNNING FOR THREE REASONS , RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA, TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS, AND THREE, TO UNITE AMERICA. I WAS TOLD YOU CANNOT UNITE AMERICA, WE ARE DONE. I HAVE LONG SET AMERICA IS AT ITS BEST WHEN WE ACT AS ONE NATION, ONE AMERICA. THAT IS THE TRAGEDY OF DONALD TRUMP BEING PRESIDENT TODAY. HE IS EXACTLY THE WRONG PERSON TO LEAD AT THIS MOMENT. HE IS DETERMINED TO DRIVE SUPPORT, KEEP HIS BASE IN PLACE. HE WILL NOT BE PRESENT FOR ALL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HIS BASE. HE BELIEVES HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT ONLY BY HIS BASE. SO HE WILL NOT APPEAL TO THE BEST INSTINCTS OF THE REST OF US. HE IS DETERMINED TO STROKE AND REVIVE THE WORST MOMENTS OF OUR PAST. I HAVE NO ILLUSION HOW TOUGH THE ROAD AHEAD IS GOING TO BE FOR OUR COUNTRY. BUT I AM AN OPTIMIST. FOR ONE REASON ABOVE ALL OTHERS. I KNOW THE HISTORY AND THE HEART OF THIS COUNTRY. AND GIVEN A CHANCE, JUST A CHANCE, ORDINARY AMERICANS CAN AND HAVE DONE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. AND I WILL NEVER, EVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN. GIVEN HALF A CHANCE, I WILL NOT LET IT DOWN NOW. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART , AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY , NO FOREIGN COUNTRY, NOT THE WAY HE CALLS UP TO , I SHOULD NOT EVEN GET INTO THIS, BUT COTTLE'S UP TO PRUDENT AND OTHERS , CAUDAL , WE JUST NEED TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING, NOTHING, NOT A SINGLE THING WE HAVE EVER FAILED TO DO WHEN WE DECIDED TO DO IT TOGETHER. THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. DOING IT TOGETHER. WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD BACK AND BUILD BACK BETTER . GOD BLESS YOU ALL. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU.

I AM HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE AND JOBS AND ARE CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE, BUT I HAVE TO START BY SPEAKING ABOUT WHAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS KNOW WHEN THEY WAKE UP EVERY MORNING WITH WORRY, ANXIETY AND FEAR. WE ARE STILL A COUNTRY IN CRISIS. THE PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED MORE THAN 3 MILLION AMERICANS. IT HAS COST OR THAN 135,000 LIVES AND CLIMBING AND SHOWS NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. IN JUST THE LAST FEW DAYS, 19 STATES, 19 STATES REPORTED RECORD CASES, INCLUDING FLORIDA, WHICH SAW MORE THAN 15,000 NEW CASES IN A SINGLE DAY. HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS, TWO OF THE MOST CONCERNING INDICATORS OF TRUMP'S FAILED RESPONSE, ARE ALREADY UNACCEPTABLY HIGH AND THEY ARE RISING. IT HAS GOTTEN BAD ENOUGH THAT EVEN DONALD TRUMP FINALLY DECIDED TO WEAR A MASK IN PUBLIC . I'M GLAD HE MADE THE SHIFT. MR. PRESIDENT, IT'S NOT ENOUGH. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TURN THE CORNER AND GET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BACK TO WORK SAFELY WITHOUT PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. MR. PRESIDENT, OPEN EVERYTHING NOW ISN'T A STRATEGY FOR SUCCESS. IT IS BARELY A SLOPE. QUIT PUSHING THE FALSE CHOICE BETWEEN PROTECTING OUR HEALTH AND PROTECTING OUR ECONOMY. ALL IT DOES IS ENDANGER OUR RECOVERY ON BOTH FRONTS. MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS INSTEAD OF DENIGRATING THEM. DO YOUR JOB, MR. PRESIDENT, BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, WE CAN'T DEAL WITH THE ECONOMIC CRISIS OR DEAL WITH ALMOST 18 MILLION AMERICANS WHO ARE OUT OF WORK AND IN INCREDIBLE PAIN, INFLICTED ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE CAN'T DEAL WITH THE CLIMATE CRISIS THAT COULD COST US AND CAST US INTO AN EVEN DARKER AND MORE PERMANENT SHADOW THAT WOULD LOOM OVER THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD FOR A LONG TIME. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO WHAT AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE, COME BACK STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE, WITH THE GRIT, TOUGHNESS, AND RESILIENCE THAT CHARACTERIZES WHO WE ARE. THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. LAST WEEK, I SHARED THE OUTLINES IN MY PLAN TO BUILD BACK BETTER. A BOLD PLAN TO BUILD AN ECONOMY OF THE FUTURE, NOT AN ECONOMY OF THE PAST. THE FIRST PLANK OF THAT PLAN REJECTS THE DEFEATIST VIEW THAT AUTOMATION AND GLOBALIZATION MEAN WE CAN'T ENSURE OUR FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA, WITH AMERICAN, GOOD-PAYING UNION JOBS HERE AT HOME MAKING IT IN AMERICA. WE CLEARLY CAN. TODAY, I AM HERE IN WILMINGTON TO TALK ABOUT A SECOND PLAN, HOW WE CAN CREATE MILLIONS OF HIGH PAYING UNION JOBS BY BUILDING A MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE AND A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. THESE ARE THE MOST CRITICAL INVESTMENTS WE CAN MAKE FOR THE LONG-TERM HEALTH AND VITALITY OF BOTH THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. EVEN IF WE WEREN'T FACING A PANDEMIC AND AN ECONOMIC CRISIS, WE SHOULD BE MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS ANYWAY. ONE IN FIVE MILES OF OUR HIGHWAYS ARE STILL IN, QUOTE, POOR CONDITION ACCORDING TO AMERICAN ENGINEERS. 10 THOUSANDS, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BRIDGES ARE IN DISREPAIR, SOME ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE, PRESENTING A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER TO PEOPLE'S LIVES. TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LACK ACCESS TO HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND. TO GET OUR PEOPLE TO WORK AND OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL SAFELY, TO GET OUR KIDS TO MARKET SWIFTLY, TO POWER CLEAN ENTERGY , ENERGY REVOLUTION, WE NEED TO MODERNIZE AMERICA'S INFRASTRUCTURE. DESPITE THIS OVERWHELMING NEED, THIS PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN CONGRESS HAS SIMPLY FAILED TO ACT. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF SAYING IT. TO CONTINUE TO BREAK THE PROMISES THEY HAVE MADE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. DONALD TRUMP PROMISED A BIG INFRASTRUCTURE BILL WHEN HE RAN IN 2016. HE PROMISED IT AGAIN IN 2017. THEN, IN 2018, AND AGAIN IN 2019 . NOW, HE IS PROMISING ONE AGAIN. SEEMS LIKE EVERY FEW WEEKS, WHEN HE NEEDS A DISTRACTION FROM THE LATEST CHARGES OF CORRUPTION IN HIS STAFF OR THE CONVICTION OF HIGH-RANKING MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION, THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES IT IS INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD HIM SAY THAT? BUT HE HAS NEVER DELIVERED. HE HAS NEVER REALLY EVEN TRIED. I KNOW HOW TO GET IT DONE. IN 2009, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I INHERITED AN ECONOMY IN FREEFALL AND WE PREVENTED ANOTHER GREAT DEPRESSION. WE ENACTED THE LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN SINCE PRESIDENT EISENHOWER'S INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. NOT ONLY CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS AND IMPROVING THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF PEOPLE ON OUR ROADS, WE MADE THE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN CLEAN ENERGY IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, $90 BILLION. THAT PUT US ON A PATH TOWARDS A THRIVING CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY, POWERING NEW ECONOMIC GROWTH AND REDUCING ENERGY COSTS. HERE WE ARE NOW WITH AN ECONOMY IN CRISIS, AND WITH AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY, NOT JUST TO BUILD BACK TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE, BUT BETTER, STRONGER, MORE RESILIENT. AND MORE PREPARED FOR THE CHALLENGES THAT LIE AHEAD. AND THERE IS NO MORE CONSEQUENTIAL CHALLENGE THAT WE MUST MEET IN THE NEXT DECADE THAN THE ONRUSHING CLIMATE CRISIS. LEFT UNCHECKED, IT IS LITERALLY THE NEXT EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE HEALTH OF OUR PLANET AND OUR VERY SURVIVAL. THAT IS NOT UP FOR DISPUTE, MR. PRESIDENT. WHEN DONALD TRUMP THINKS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, THE ONLY WORD HE CAN MUSTER IS HOAX. WHEN I THINK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, THE WORD I THINK OF IS JOBS. GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS THAT WILL PUT AMERICANS TO WORK MAKING THE AIR CLEANER FOR OUR KIDS TO BREATHE, RESTORING OUR CRUMBLING ROADS AND BRIDGES AND PORTS, MAKING IT FASTER, CHEAPER, AND CLEANER TO TRANSPORT AMERICAN MADE GOODS ACROSS THE WORLD. JOBS, JOBS TO BUILD AND INSTALL A NETWORK OF 500,000 CARDING STATIONS ALONG OUR EXISTING AND NEW HIGHWAYS WE BUILD ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHICH WILL NOT ONLY HELP AMERICA AND AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY LEAD THE WORLD AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES, IT WILL SAVE AMERICANS BUSY , BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER TIME AND THE COST OF GASOLINE FOR THEIR VEHICLES. JOBS THAT LAY THE LINES FOR THE SECOND GREAT RAILROAD REVOLUTION, WHICH WILL NOT ONLY SLASH POLLUTION AND COMMUTE TIMES AND , IT WILL OPEN UP AREAS CONNECTED TO METROPOLITAN CENTERS FOR THE FIRST TIME. WHEN DONALD TRUMP THINKS ABOUT RENEWABLE ENERGY, HE SEES WINDMILLS SOMEHOW CAUSING CANCER. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THESE WINDMILLS, ICY AMERICAN MANUFACTURING, AMERICAN WORKERS RACING TO DOMINATE THE GLOBAL MARKET. I SEE THE STEEL THAT WILL BE NEEDED FOR THOSE WINDMILL PLATFORM TOWERS AND BLADDERS THAT CAN BE MADE IN SMALL MANUFACTURERS LIKE MCGREGOR INDUSTRIES IN SCRANTON. I SEE THE UNION TRADE AND CERTIFIED MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL MANUFACTURE AND INSTALL IT ALL. I SEE THE PORTS THAT WILL COME BACK TO LIFE, THE LONGSHOREMAN, THE SHIPBUILDERS, THE COMMUNITIES THEY SUPPORT. WHEN DONALD TRUMP TALKS ABOUT IMPROVING EFFICIENCY BY RETROFITTING LIGHTING SYSTEMS WITH LED BULBS, REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID HE DOESN'T LIKE LED BECAUSE, QUOTE, THE LIGHT'S NO GOOD. I ALWAYS LOOK ORANGE. END OF QUOTE. THE LIGHT NO GOOD. I ALWAYS LOOK ORANGE. WHEN I THINK ABOUT ENERGY RETROFITTING FOR LIGHTING, I SEE THE INCREDIBLE PROJECTS LIKE THE ONE RIGHT HERE IN THE CHASE CENTER. I SEE SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE PREFERRED ELECTRIC THAT DESIGN AND INSTALL AWARD-WINNING ENERGY CONSERVATION MEASURES THAT REDUCE CONSUMPTION OF ELECTRICITY AND SAVE BUSINESSES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN ENERGY COSTS PER YEAR. I SEE ELECTRICIANS AND UNION WORKERS WHO, THROUGH APPRENTICESHIPS, START OFF WITH GOOD WAGES AND QUALITY BENEFITS THAT ONLY GROW FROM THERE. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE A WIN-WIN-WIN FOR THIS COUNTRY, CREATING JOBS, CUTTING ENERGY COSTS, PROTECTING OUR CLIMATE. THAT IS WHY TODAY, I'M RELEASING MY PLAN TO MOBILIZE MILLIONS OF JOBS BY BUILDING SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND AN EQUITABLE CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. IN MY FIRST FOUR YEARS, WE ARE GOING TO GIVE 4 MILLION BUILDINGS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY THE SAME ENERGY MAKEOVER THAT YOU GET HERE AT CHASE AT THE CHASE CENTER. IT IS GOING TO CREATE AT LEAST ONE MILLION JOBS IN CONSTRUCTION , ENGINEERING, AND MANUFACTURING IN ORDER TO GET IT DONE. IT IS GOING TO MAKE PLACES, THE PLACES WHERE WE WORK, WE LIVE, WE LEARN, HEALTHIER, IMPROVING INDOOR AIR QUALITY, WATER QUALITY. IT IS GOING TO SAVE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ENERGY COSTS OVER TIME. THAT IS ALL REAL. WE ARE NOT JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON COMMERCIAL SPACES. WE ARE GOING TO GIVE DIRECT SUPPORT TO HELP FAMILIES DO THE SAME THING FOR THEIR HOMES. WE ARE GOING TO OFFER CASH REBATES AND LOW-COST FINANCING TO UPGRADE ENERGY EFFICIENT , ON , ENERGY INEFFICIENT WINDOWS AT APPLIANCES TO CUT ENERGY BILLS AND SAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR. WE WILL MAKE A MAJOR INVESTMENT TO BUILD 1.5 MILLION NEW ENERGY EFFICIENT HOMES AND PUBLIC HOUSING WILL BENEFIT FROM COMMUNITIES BY ALLEVIATING THE AFFORDABLE PROCESS , CRISIS, AND REDUCING THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP LINKED TO HOMEOWNERSHIP. LAST WEEK, I TALKED ABOUT USING THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REINVIGORATE THE MASTIC MANUFACTURING. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, AS WELL. THE UNITED STATES OWNED , OWNS AND MAINTAINS AN ENORMOUS FLEET OF VEHICLES. WE ARE GOING TO CONVERT THESE GOVERNMENT FLEETS TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. MADE AND SOURCED RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WITH THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDING THE DEMAND AND GRANTS TO RETOOL FACTORIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO COMPETE. THE U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY AND ITS DEEP BANKS OF SUPPLIERS WILL STEP UP, EXPANDING CAPACITY SO THE UNITED STATES, NOT CHINA, LEADS THE WORLD IN CLEAN VEHICLE PRODUCTION. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERS TO SWITCH TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES, AS WELL. NOT ONLY BY BUILDING 500,000 CHARGING STATIONS, BUT BY OFFERING REBATES AND INCENTIVES TO SWAP OLDER FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLES FOR NEW, CLEAN, MADE IN AMERICA VEHICLES, SAVING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF BARRELS, MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THIS WILL MEAN ONE MILLION NEW GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY. THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND THE ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO GET IT DONE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT TRANSFORMING THE AMERICAN ELECTRICAL SECTOR TO PRODUCE POWER WITHOUT PRODUCING CARBON POLLUTION AND ELECTRIFYING AND INCREASED SHARE OF THE ECONOMY WILL BE THE GREATEST SPURRING OF JOB CREATION AND ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS IN THE 21ST CENTURY. THAT IS WHY WE WILL ACHIEVE A CARBON FREE POLLUTION , CARBON POLLUTION-FREE ENERGY SECTOR BY 2035. WE NEED TO GET TO WORK RIGHT AWAY. WE NEED SCIENTISTS AND NATIONAL LABS AND LAND-GRANT UNIVERSITIES, HBCUS, TO IMPROVE AND INNOVATE TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO STORE, GENERATE AND TRANSMIT CLEAN ENERGY. WE NEED THE ENGINEERS TO DESIGN THEM, THE WORKERS TO MANUFACTURE THEM, WE NEED IRON WORKERS AND WELDERS TO INSTALL THEM. WE WILL BECOME THE WORLD'S LARGEST EXPORTER OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES, CREATING EVEN MORE JOBS. WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. OUR ADMINISTRATION RESCUED THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND HELP TO RETOOL , MADE SOLAR ENERGY THE SAME COST AS TRADITIONAL ENERGY, WEATHERIZED MORE THAN A MILLION HOMES AND WE WILL DO IT AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME, BIGGER AND FASTER AND SMARTER. AS WE DO THIS WORK, WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE HISTORICAL WRONGS AND THE DAMAGE THAT AMERICAN INDUSTRIES HAVE DONE IN THE 20TH CENTURY, INFLICTING ENVIRONMENTAL HARM ON THE POOR AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES, SO OFTEN BLACK AND BROWN AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. POLLUTED AIR AND WATER, TOXINS RAINING DOWN FROM COMMUNITIES, THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH BURDENS, AND THEY SHARED NONE OF THE PROPHETS. GROWING UP, BREATHING THAT AIR EVERY DAY, IT IS POISON. THAT IS PARTLY WHY THERE ARE INCREDIBLE RATES OF CHILDHOOD ASTHMA IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. WHY BLACK AMERICANS ARE ALMOST THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE OF ASTHMA RELATED CAUSES THAN WHITE AMERICANS. IT IS CANCER ALLEY IN ST. JAMES PARISH, LOUISIANA. THERE ARE CANCER-CAUSING CLUSTERS ALONG ROUTE NINE IN DELAWARE. THAT IS WHY TODAY, I AM ALSO RELEASING A STATE OF THE ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE POLICIES TO BUILD ON MY EXISTING PLAN. THIS IS AN AREA OF INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR OUR COUNTRY AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT BENEFIT FROM THIS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MOST HURT BY IT HISTORICALLY IN THE LAST CENTURY, BY THE STRUCTURAL DISPARITIES THAT EXIST. I'M SETTING A GOAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE FRONTLINE AND FENCE LINE COMMUNITIES, WHETHER IN RURAL PLACES OR CENTER CITY'S, RECEIVE 40% OF THE BENEFITS FROM THE INVESTMENTS WE ARE MAKING IN HOUSING, POLLUTION REDUCTION, AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, AND TRANSPORTATION, ACROSS THE BOARD. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO CREATE JOBS FOR PEOPLE BY CLEANING UP THE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED. YOU SAW THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES TWO DAYS AGO. ALL THESE PLACES THAT ARE GOING BANKRUPT, EXCEPT FOR THE BENEFITS, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS GOING TO CEO'S. MORE THAN A QUARTER MILLION JOBS FOR DOING THINGS LIKE PLUGGING ABANDONED WELLS THAT EXIST ACROSS THE COUNTRY, POSING DAILY THREATS TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. WE WILL HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THOSE CEOS AND CORPORATIONS THAT BENEFIT FROM DECADES OF SUBSIDIES AND THEN WALKED AWAY FROM THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. LEAVING THE WELLS TO LEAK, POLLUTANTS TO CONTINUE TO SWPPEW, GREENHOUSE GASES FLOWING INTO THE AIR ON THE WATER. WE WILL NOT ONLY REPEALED THOSE SUBSIDIES, WE WILL GO AFTER THOSE GOLDEN PARACHUTES THE CEOS GAVE THEMSELVES BEFORE DECLARING BANKRUPTCY TO MAKE SURE THE WORKERS RECEIVE THE BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT THEY WERE PROMISED. LET'S CREATE NEW MARKETS. FOR OUR FAMILY FARMERS AND OUR RENTERS. A , AND OUR RENTERS. A NEW CIVILIAN CLIMATE CORE TO HELP PUBLIC LANDS, TO MAKE US LESS VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRES AND FLOODS. LOOK. THESE AREN'T PIE IN THE SKY DREAMS. THESE ARE ACTIONABLE POLICIES THAT WE CAN GET TO WORK ON RIGHT AWAY. WE CAN LIVE UP TO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES, MEET THE CHALLENGES OF A WORLD AT RISK OF A CLIMATE CATASTROPHE, BUILD MORE CLIMATE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES, PUT MILLIONS OF SKILLED WORKERS ON THE JOB, AND MAKE LIFE MARKEDLY BETTER AND SAFER FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALL AT ONCE AND BENEFIT THE WORLD IN THE PROCESS. THE ALTERNATIVE, CONTINUE TO IGNORE THE FACTS, DENY REALITY, FOCUS ONLY ON TECHNOLOGY OF THE LAST CENTURY INSTEAD OF THE ADVANCING TECHNOLOGIES OF THE CENTURY. IT IS JUST PLAIN UN-AMERICAN NOT TO. THIS IS ALL DONALD TRUMP AND THE AMERICANS OFFER. BACKWARD LOOKING POLICIES THAT WILL HOLD BACK ECONOMIC PROMISE WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES RACE AHEAD. IT IS A MINDSET. IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY FAITH IN THE CAPACITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO COMPETE, INNOVATE, AND TO WIN. IT HAS NEVER BEEN A GOOD BET TO BET AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHEN YOU DO, IT WILL EXACT A DEADLY COST. I KNOW BETTER. I KNOW YOU DO, AS WELL. I KNOW WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF. I KNOW WHAT AMERICAN WORKERS CAN ACCOMPLISH WHEN GIVEN THE ROOM TO RUN. I KNOW THE CLIMATE CHANGE, THE CHALLENGE THAT IS GOING TO DEFINE OUR AMERICAN FUTURE. I KNOW MEETING THE CHALLENGE WILL BE A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO JOLT NEW LIFE INTO OUR ECONOMY, SEND IN OUR GLOBAL LEADERSHIP, PROTECT OUR PLANET FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT, WE WON'T JUST TINKER AROUND THE EDGES, WE WILL MAKE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS THAT WILL SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY AND MEET THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY. WE ARE GOING TO GET TO WORK TO DELIVER THE RESULTS RIGHT AWAY ON DAY ONE. WE ARE GOING TO REVERSE TRUMP'S ROLLBACK OF 100 PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL RULES, THEN FORGE A PATH TO GREATER AMBITION. WE ARE GOING TO GET BACK INTO THE PARIS AGREEMENT, BACK INTO THE BUSINESS OF LEADING THE WORLD. WE ARE GOING TO LOCK IN PROGRESS AND NO FUTURE PRESIDENT CAN UNDERCUT TO TAKE US BACKWARD AGAIN. SCIENCE REQUIRES A TIMETABLE FOR MEASURING PROGRESS ON CLIMATE THAT ISN'T THREE DECADES OR EVEN TWO. SCIENCE TELLS US WE HAVE NINE YEARS BEFORE THE DAMAGE IS IRREVERSIBLE. SO MY TIMETABLE RESULTS, IN MY FIRST FOUR YEARS AS PRESIDENT, THE JOBS WE WILL CREATE, THE INVESTMENTS WE WILL MAKE, THE IRREVERSIBLE STEPS WE WILL TAKE TO MITIGATE AND ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND PUT OUR NATION ON THE ROAD TO NET ZERO EMISSIONS NO LATER THAN 2050. SO LET'S NOT WASTE ANY MORE TIME. LET'S GET TO WORK NOW. NOW. THANK YOU.

LIVE NOW TO NEWCASTLE DELAWARE TO HEAR REMARKS FROM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN AND HIS PLAN TO HELP THE U.S. ECONOMY RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY. I WANT TO THANK THE COLONIAL EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAM HERE IN CALYX AND FOR HOSTING US TONIGHT. YOU KNOW, I JUST MET SARA JOHNSON WHO I THOUGHT I SAW SARA SOMEWHERE IN HERE BUT SHE HAS A THREE YEAR OLD SON KNOW WHO IS A STUDENT HERE. SHE SAID THIS PROGRAM THAT'S WONDERS HELPING NOAA LEARN HIS LETTERS AND NUMBERS AND SOCIALIZE WITH OTHER KIDS AND UNDERSTAND HIS EMOTIONS AND DEVELOP HIS PERSONALITY. I BET HE IS A BRIGHT, CUTE YOUNG MAN. BUT LIKE SO MANY PARENTS, SHE IS WORRIED. HE IS WORRIED ABOUT HER JOB AS A DENTAL ASSISTANT AND VOUCHING CHANGES, AND WHAT SHE HAS TO DO TO MAKE THINGS WORK. SHE'S NOSING CHANGES IN NOAA'S BEHAVIOR SINCE HE HASN'T BEEN IN SCHOOL SINCE MARCH. AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE SAID TO THE PRINCIPAL, WHERE IS MY TEACHER, CAN I STAY HERE IN PLAY, WE ARE IN HIS CLASSROOM AND SHE HAS HAD TO LEARN TO LEAN ON PARENTS, WHICH MANY, MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO DO, TO HELP HER GET THROUGH IT AND IS REALLY TOUGH. PARENTS LIKE SARA AND PLACES LIKE THE CENTER AND THE CAREGIVERS AND EDUCATORS WHO WORK HERE ALSO GIVE ME A GREAT DEAL OF HOPE. YOU KNOW, REINFORCING MY ABSENCE DETERMINATION, I'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR OVER TWO YEARS TO TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS IN THOSE DISTRICTS LIKE THIS ONE WHERE EVERY CHILD IN A TITLE ONE DISTRICT IS ABLE TO HAVE THE BENEFITS OF AN EDUCATION AT THREE AND FOUR YEARS OF AGE. THAT IS WHY I COULD NOT THINK OF A BETTER PLACE TO TALK ABOUT THE THIRD PLANK OF MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN FOR THE ECONOMY THIS IS ABOUT EASING THE SQUEEZE ON WORKING FAMILIES WHO ARE RAISING THEIR KIDS AND CARING FOR AGING LOVED ONES AT THE SAME TIME, SOMETIMES, SEPARATELY BUT MANY, TIMES TOGETHER. IT IS ABOUT CREATING JOBS WITH BETTER PAY AND CAREER PATHWAYS FOR CAREGIVERS AND SHOWING THEM THAT DIGNITY AND RESPECT THEY DESERVE, BUT I KNOW IT'S HARD. I KNOW IT'S HARD TO THINK OF A FUTURE WHEN YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE CRISIS AT HAND. I KNOW THAT THE CASE OF CHILDCARE FACILITIES ACROSS THE NATION IS DIRE. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR HELP DESPERATELY, AND THEY HAVE HAD TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS AND LAY OFF STAFF AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED TO OPEN AND THE VIRUS HOTSPOTS, WHERE THEY EXIST, AND THEY EXIST ALL OVER THE NATION, THEY CANNOT REOPEN AT ALL AND WE ARE IN A CHILDCARE EMERGENCY AND DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CALLING ON THE PRESIDENT TO GET THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED AND GET THEM NOW. ENOUGH. EACH DAY, THE PANDEMIC DEATH TOLL GROWS. EACH DAY, IN SOME STATES, MORE PEOPLE TEST POSITIVE THAN THE DAY BEFORE, AND EACH DAY, TOO MANY AMERICAN WORKERS ARE STILL OUT OF WORK AND LOSING HOPE. IT'S BEEN REPORTED BY THE PRESIDENT'S STAFF THAT THE PRESIDENT IS, QUOTE, NOT REALLY WORKING ON THIS ANYMORE. HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE DISTRACTED BY IT. DOESN'T WANT TO BE DISTRACTED BY IT. HIS OWN STAFF ADMITS THAT DONALD TRUMP FAILS THE MOST IMPORTANT TEST OF BEING AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT, THE DUTY TO CARE FOR YOU AND FOR ALL OF US. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALSO BEING REPORTED THAT HE'LL BLOCK ANY FUNDING FOR MORE TESTING AND TRACING IN THE NEXT COVID RELIEF BILL WHICH IS BEING DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS JUST ESTATES REPORT RECORD CASES OF HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS CONTINUE TO RISE. , THIS MAN SIMPLY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND, HE CAN'T DEAL WITH AN ECONOMIC CRISIS WITHOUT SOLVING THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. FOR ALL HIS BLUSTER ABOUT HIS EXPECTATION OF THE ECONOMY, HE'S NOT ABLE TO EXPLAIN HOW IT WILL ACTUALLY HELP WORKING FAMILIES HIT THE HARDEST. YOU KNOW, HE IS QUIT ON YOU. HE HAS QUIT ON THIS COUNTRY. BUT THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT HIM. IT IS ABOUT US. IT IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT WHAT WILL DO, WHAT A PRESIDENT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. A PRESIDENT IS SUPPOSED TO CARE, TO LEAD, TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, TO NEVER GIVE UP. THAT IS WHAT PRESIDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS, I HAVE SHARED MY AGENDA FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY. I CALL IT BUILD BACK BETTER. BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST BUILD BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE BEFORE, WE HAVE TO DO IT BETTER, AND THE FIRST PLANK IN MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN REJECTS THE DEFEATIST VIEW THAT AUTOMATION AND GLOBALIZATION MEAN WE CAN , WE CAN'T ASSURE AMERICAN WORKERS LEAD TO A FUTURE MADE IN AMERICA, MADE IN AMERICA. THE SECOND PLANK HELPS US COMPETE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD AND TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE, PUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO WORK IN GOOD, UNION JOBS, MODERNIZE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE WHILE BUILDING A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE, INCREASING JOBS. TODAY, I'M OUTLINING THE THIRD PLANK IN MY BUILD BACK BETTER PROGRAM. MOBILIZING FOR 24 CENTURY CARE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WORK FOR FORCED TO DEAL WITH A CAREGIVING CRISIS AND IT IS A CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY. IF WE TRULY WANT TO REWARD WORK IN THIS COUNTRY, WE HAVE TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF CARE THAT FAMILIES ARE CARRYING. WE HAVE TO ELEVATE THE COMPENSATION OF THOSE PROVIDING THE CARE, THE BENEFITS AND DIGNITY OF CAREGIVING WORKERS AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS. EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, MILLIONS OF WORKING FAMILIES ARE FACED WITH AN ENORMOUS FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL STRAIN, TRYING TO RAISE THEIR KIDS AND CARE FOR THEIR PARENTS AND LOVED ONES WHO ARE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES. THIS IS THE SO-CALLED SANDWICH GENERATION. AND INCLUDES EVERYONE FROM AN 18 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER CARRYING FOR A MOM WHO SUDDENLY GET SICK, THROUGH A 40-YEAR-OLD DAD RAISING HIS CHILD AND CARING FOR HIS OWN AGING PARENTS. THE JOY AND LOVER ALWAYS THERE, BUT IT'S HARD. I KNOW IT'S HARD. IT'S REALLY, REALLY HARD. FAMILIES ARE SQUEEZED EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY. THEY NEED HELP AND TOO OFTEN THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT AND THE PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS OUT THERE, THE HOME HEALTH CARE WORKERS, CHILDCARE WORKERS ARE MORE OFTEN, WOMEN, WOMEN OF COLOR, AND IMMIGRANTS, OFTEN ON CNN UNDERVALUED. THE PANDEMIC HITS AND SQUEEZES AND TITANS ON EVERYBODY. NURSING HOMES HAVE BEEN HIT HARD. IF YOU ARE A FRONTLINE WORKER, YOU STRUGGLE TO FIND SAFE CHILDCARE FOR YOUR KIDS. OTHERS IF YOU HAVE BECOME UNEXPECTED 24\/7 CAREGIVERS, TRYING TO KEEP YOUR CHILDREN SAFE AND LEARNING WHILE YOU CONTINUE TO WORK REMOTELY FROM HOME. IF YOU HAD TO PUT YOUR CAREER ON HOLD INDEFINITELY OR SENIOR HOURS QATAR YOUR JOB, LOST THE CONFUSION, THE CONFUSION OVER SCHOOL REOPENING ONLY MAKES THINGS WORSE. YOU, KNOW IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAS ONLY UNDERSCORED HOW VITAL IT IS FOR FAMILIES AND OLDER AMERICANS TO HAVE MORE HOME CARE AND COMMUNITY CARE CHOICES THAT FIT THEY ARE REAL NEEDS. YOU KNOW, WE ARE TRAPPED IN A CAREGIVING CRISIS WITHIN A NIGHT ECONOMIC CRISIS WITHIN A HEALTH CARE CRISIS. YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN BUT THIS PRESIDENT DOES NOT. IF I'M YOUR PRESIDENT, HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO. FIRST, LET'S START BY CARING FOR AGING RELATIVES AND LOVED ONES WITH DISABILITIES, HELPING THEM LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 800,000 PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HOME IN COMMUNITY CARE THROUGH MEDICAID, WE'VE ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR IT, BUT THEY'RE WAITING FOR A PHONE CALL, A PHONE CALL BACK. FOR SOME, THE WAIT IS FIVE YEARS, FIVE YEARS. MY PLAN MAKES A BOLD INVESTMENT, SO STATES CAN CLEAR THE WAITING LIST TO MAKE SURE WE EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR MORE FAMILIES GOING FORWARD. WE HAVE TO MAKE A LONG TERM FEDERAL INVESTMENT. WE WILL HAVE A MAJOR INNOVATION FUND TO ALLOW STATES TO TEST AND EXPAND SUCCESSFUL WAYS TO IMPROVE HOME AND COMMUNITY CARE AND INCREASE PREVENTION AND REDUCE THE COST OF HOSPITALIZATION. THINK OF EXPANDED VITAL SERVICES LIKE RISE TO APPOINTMENTS, MEALS, DAY PROGRAMS FOR SENIORS, MAKING THEIR HOME SAFER FOR THEM. IT BUILDS ON AN INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE PROVISION UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. VERY PROGRAM THE PRESIDENT SEES LOVELY IS TRYING TO GET, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS A PILOT PROGRAM NOW IN 27 CITIES AND 16 STATES WHERE A NURSE, AN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST, AND A HANDYMAN COME TO THE HOME THAT IS CARING FOR AN AGING FAMILY MEMBER. THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CURE MOMS ALZHEIMER'S BUT THEY CAN MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T BREAK HER HIP. SO, THEY WALK THROUGH THE HOUSE. THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON NOW, AND THEY INSTALL HANDRAILS IN THE RIGHT SPOTS IN THE HOUSE, IN THE BATHROOM, OR THEY FIX THE DOOR THAT IS STUCK SO SHE DOESN'T TRIP WHAT HE TRIES TO OPEN IT. THEY INITIALLY FOUND AN ABOUT 3000 DOLLARS IN PROGRAM COSTS YIELDS MORE THAN 20,000 DOLLARS AND SAVINGS TO THE GOVERNMENT, IN HOSPITALIZATIONS AND OTHER REASONS. SIMPLE STEPS SAVE LIVES, SAVE MONEY, AND PROVIDE CRITICAL PEACE OF MIND. HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE. WHETHER YOU LIVE IN RURAL NORTH CAROLINA ARE CENTRAL PHILADELPHIA, PEOPLE OF COLOR, OUR ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES CASE PUNISHING HEALTH DISPARITIES FROM A SYSTEM OF SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION. THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. HEY DON'T SEE A DOCTOR. SOMETIMES LANGUAGE IS A BARRIER AND THEY SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS, SLIP THROUGH THE GAPS SO THAT THERE ARE TREATABLE CONDITION, , SO THAT THE TREATABLE CONDITION, BECAUSE I CANNOT AFFORD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR, BECOMES A CHRONIC CONDITION. THAT IS WHY COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ARE REAL HEROES. THEY GO TO THESE COMMUNITIES, THEY MAKE SURE FOLKS ARE GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED. MY PLAN PUTS TO WORK 150,000 MORE OF THESE WORKERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THESE ARE THE THINGS WE CAN DO NOW. SECONDLY, WE CAN ALSO MAKE HIGH QUALITY CHILDCARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. MY CHILD CARE PLAN IS STRAIGHTFORWARD. EVERY THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD CHILD WILL GET ACCESS TO FREE, HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL, LIKE STUDENTS HAVE HERE, AND LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WILL SPEND MORE THAN 7% OF YOUR INCOME ON CHILD CARE FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE. THE MOST HARD-PRESSED WORKING FAMILIES WOULD HAVE TO SPEND A DIME. HERE IS HOW IT WORKS. THEY'RE GONNA DECIDE TO GET UP TO AN 8000 DOLLAR TAX CREDIT FOR CHILDCARE. FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY WITH A COUPLE OF YOUNG KIDS SPENDING 300 DOLLARS A WEEK ON CHILD CARE THAT MEANS AND ANNUAL SAVINGS OF 8000 DOLLARS IN THEIR POCKET, BECAUSE IT'S A TAX CREDIT. IT MEANS EVERYTHING FOR WORKING FAMILIES LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH SENDS FUNDING TO STATES, WHICH THEN WORK WITH CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO COVER THE COST FOR WORKING FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN OVER 7% OF THEIR INCOME WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE SPENT. SO, SAY BOTH PARENTS ARE WORKING AND NEED CHILDCARE. YOU GO TO CHILDCARE .GOV, WHICH IS CREATED UNDER THE OBAMA BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO HELP FIND CHILDCARE THAT WORKS FOR YOU UNDER MY PLAN, IT TAKES YOU TO YOUR STATE WEBSITE, LOCAL CHILDCARE SANDERS POP-UP, OR YOU CAN CALL OR FILL IN YOUR INFORMATION. YOU APPLY TO WHICH WHEN YOU WANT TO GO TO. THE STATEMENT SENDS YOU A LETTER SAYING YOUR PROVED AND LAYS OUT THE AMOUNT YOU'RE GOING TO PAY. THE STATE SENDS THAT INFORMATION TO THE CHILD CARE PROVIDER AND THEN THE STATE REINFORCES THE CHILD CARE CENTER ON THE BACK END. YOU JUST PAY WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO PAY, NOT A DIME FOR SOME WORKING FAMILIES AND MORE THAN 7% FOR ANYONE ELSE. YOU CAN DO THAT. THIS WOULD SAY FAMILIES THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, MORE IMPORTANTLY, GIVE THEM PEACE OF MIND. THERE'S OTHER COMMON SENSE STEPS WE CAN TAKE LIKE EXPANDING TAX CREDITS FOR BUSINESSES TO BUILD CHILDCARE FACILITIES ON SITE, SO YOU CAN GO TO WORK WITH YOUR CHILD, PUT THEM INTO CHILDCARE CENTER THAT THE COMPANY GOT MONEY FOR HIM TAX CREDIT FOR BUILDING, SUPPORTING MORE AND MORE AND GIVING PEACE OF MIND TO THE FAMILY, AND WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED WORK, TAKE THAT CHILD HOME. SUPPORTING AFTERCARE, WE KIND OF SUMMER CARE PROGRAMS FOR FAMILIES. THIRD, WE EXPAND ACCESS TO CAREGIVING. WE NEED TO PAY AND SUPPORT CAREGIVERS BEYOND WHAT THEY ARE NOW. THEY ARE DOING GODS WORK, HOME HEALTH WORKERS ARE PAID MUCH. THEY HAVE FEW BENEFITS. 40% ARE STILL ON SNAP OR MEDICAID SO, MY PLAN IS DIRECT. IT GIVES CAREGIVERS AN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS MUCH-NEEDED BREAKS. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN ONE JOB TO MAKE ENDS MEET. UNDER MY HEALTH CARE PLAN THEY DEFENDS AND EXPANDS OBAMACARE, THERE WILL BE MORE AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE. I WILL MAKE SURE THESE WORKERS HAVE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO UNIONIZE AND COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED THEIR PROTECTIVE RIGHTS AND EARN BENEFITS. THIS PLAN WILL HELP WORKERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE, UP AND GAIN NEW SKILLS AND , IN GOOD PAID INDUSTRIES LIKE HEALTH CARE AND PROVIDES NEW PATHWAYS TO ADVANCE THEIR CAREERS. FOR EXAMPLE, HOME HEALTH CARE WORKER CAN HAVE ACCESS TO TRAINING NEEDED TO BECOME AN EMPTY OR NURSE, OR PHYSICIANS ASSISTANT OR EVEN A DOCTOR. OR THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATOR CAN RECEIVE COACHING KEEP DELIVERING A HIGH QUALITY LEARNING EXPERIENCE. WE CAN DO THAT AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT MOBILIZE CAREGIVING EARLY EDUCATION WORKFORCE COULD SAY FAMILIES TIME AND MONEY, GET THEIR LOVED ONES THE CARE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THEY NEED AND PUT MORE PEOPLE TO WORK, ALLOWING HUSBANDS AND WIVES TO GO BACK TO WORK, AND PROVIDE MANY PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A JOB THAT IS A DECENT JOB CARING TO KEEP SENIORS IN THEIR HOMES, AS TRIPLE WIN, IF THEY CHOOSE THAT. WE RECOGNIZE THE REALITIES FACING MODERN FAMILIES, AND PROVIDE SOME MUCH NEEDED ECONOMIC SUPPORT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. JUST IMAGINE. WE CAN PUT 3 MILLION AMERICANS TO WORK IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND PROVIDE , THE LIFE OF MY PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH UP TO 12 WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE WE COULD FREE UP MILLIONS MORE PEOPLE TO JOIN THE PAY LABOR FORCE, INCREASING ECONOMIC GROWTH. MEANING AT LEAST 2 MILLION ADDITIONAL JOBS, MORE ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THE NATION. THIS IS A FRESH, BOLD WAY TO BUILD A CRITICAL PART OF THE LABOR FORCE AND HELP US RECOVER FASTER AND STRONGER. WE USUALLY TALK ABOUT JOBS PACKAGES. THERE IS A BIG PUSH ON SHOVEL READY JOBS. I'M THE GUY WHO YOU MAY REMEMBER MANAGE THE RECOVERY ACT OF 800 PLUS BILLION DOLLARS. I WAS FOCUSED ON SHOVEL READY JOBS, BUT WE CAN DO IMMEDIATELY. BUT THAT IS WHAT CARE JOBS ARE. THEY ARE SHOVEL READY. THE WORKERS ARE READY NOW. THESE JOBS CAN BE FILLED NOW. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, PRIMARILY WOMEN, TO GET BACK TO WORK NOW INCREASING THE GROWTH OF THE GDP AND FAMILY INCOME. IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR OUR FAMILIES AND OUR MOST ESSENTIAL WORKERS THAT IS THE SMART THING TO DO FOR OUR ECONOMY. TODAY, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAN'T FULLY PURSUE THE JOBS AND CAREERS THEY DREAM OF DUE TO THE CAREGIVING SQUEEZE. THAT MEANS TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS IN WAGES EACH YEAR FOR OUR WORK AND FAMILIES. IT MEANS MORE DISRUPTION FOR OUR BUSINESS, FEWER JOBS, GROWTH, AND OUR ECONOMY. THIS IS BOTH A MORAL AND AN ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE, AND HOWEVER WE PAY FOR IT IS BY ROLLING BACK ON PROTECTING TAX CUTS, SOME OF THE TWO TRILLION DOLLAR TAX CUT THE PRESIDENT PUT THROUGH, CLOSING LOOPHOLES, UNPRODUCTIVE TAX CUTS FOR HIGH INCOME REAL ESTATE INVESTORS WHILE ENSURING HIGH INCOME EARNERS PAY THEIR TAX BILLS. WE INVEST THAT, AND WE ADD UP TO 775 BILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS. WE INVEST THAT IN BUILDING OUR ECONOMY BACK BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE GROWING THE ECONOMY STRONGER AND TOMORROW I WILL BE DOING A VIRTUAL TOWN HALL WITH HOME CARE WORKERS, FAST FOOD, WORKERS JANITORS, HEARING DIRECTLY FROM THEM ABOUT WHY THIS MATTERS SO MUCH TO THEM BECAUSE, YOU SEE, THIS IS ABOUT SOMETHING BIGGER. THIS IS ABOUT DIGNITY AND RESPECT FOR WORKING PEOPLE AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT, DIGNITY AND RESPECT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THEY'RE NOT BEING AFFORDED DIGNITY AND RESPECT OR ANY OTHER JOBS. THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT HAS A DUTY TO CARE FOR ALL OF US, TO SEE PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE, TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND WHAT THEY WANT TO BE. AS MANY OF YOU, KNOW I WAS A SINGLE PARENT FOR FIVE YEARS AFTER MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KILLED WHEN IT WAS HARD IT WAS HARD. IF I DID NOT HAVE MY MOM, MY SISTER, MY BROTHER, I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD IT. THEN, SIX YEARS LATER WHEN YOU AND I GOT MARRIED, I SAW HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS FOR HER TO START HER TEACHING CAREER WHILE BEING A NEW MOM WITH TWO KIDS IN SCHOOL. WE CARED, WELL, ACTUALLY THEY WANTED SCHOOL YET NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT. WE CARED FOR OUR PARENTS AT THE END. MY DAD WAS MONTH IN HOSPICE IN OUR HOME, SAME WITH MY MOM, AND OUR ENTIRE FAMILY WAS THERE FOR OUR SON BEAU WHO CAME HOME FROM A YEAR IN IRAQ WITH A CANCER THERE WASN'T WHETHER HE WOULD LIVE, IT WAS JUST HOW LONG HE WOULD LIVE. WE KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE. MONTHS UPON MONTHS. WE KNOW SO MANY OF YOU ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING WITHOUT THE KIND OF HELP I HAD BUT NOW EVERYTHING FEELS DIFFERENT. THERE IS JUST THAT FEELING, THAT SENSE, WHERE YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IF EVERYTHING IS GOING TO TURN OUT OKAY. BUT I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IT CAN BE AND IT WILL BE. YOU KNOW, MY DAD WAS AN HONORABLE, DECENT MAN, IT WAS A GREAT REGRET HE NEVER GOT TO GO TO COLLEGE. MY DAD, LIKE MANY OF YOUR PARENTS, GOT KNOCKED DOWN A FEW TIMES AND HE ALWAYS GOT BACK UP. HE WORKED HARD TO BUILD A GREAT MIDDLE CLASS LIFE FOR OUR FAMILIES BUT HE USED TO HAVE A SAYING. WE WOULD SAY, JOEY, I DON'T EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS, BUT I SURE AS HELL EXPECT THEM TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. I UNDERSTAND MY VERY CORE, AND I ALSO KNOW THAT TOGETHER WE CAN DO THIS. THIS IS AMERICA. WE DON'T SETTLE, WE ASPIRE, AND WE SUCCEEDED SO, LET'S GET THE HELL, THE HECK UP AND GET IT DONE. LET'S GET TO WORK. I PUT A MIGRAINE POPS HOUSE UP IN, SCREENWRITER LOST HIS JOB, AND WE LIVE WITH MY GRANDPA. EVERY TIME WE WALKED OUT SHE WOULD SAY JOE, AND KEEP THE FAITH AND MY GRANDMOTHER AS WE KNOW, JOE, WE SPREAD IT. LET'S GO SPREAD THE FAITH. WE CAN DO THIS. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING WE CANNOT DO. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING YOUR QUESTIONS ANOTHER TIME, BUT I'M OFF TO ANOTHER EVENT. THANK YOU, PRINCIPAL. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE. APPRECIATE IT VERY, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?474018-1\/joe-biden-remarks-economic-recovery","Summary":"Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, delivered remarks in New Castle, Deleware, on his plan to help the economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic.

JOHN'S CHURCH NEARBY. AFTER THAT REACTION TO THE 1 TRILLION-DOLLAR SENATE REPUBLICAN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE PLAN FROM SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL : : : ACTUALLY THAT IS A JOKE. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE BACK IN A PLACE AND I WANT TO THANK WAYNE JEFFERSON HERE FOR HAVING US EVERYBODY KNEW WHO HICKS WAS HE WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES TALK POLITICS IN THE STATE FOR A LONG TIME AND WAS VERY MUCH ENGAGED BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN DOCTOR KING WAS ASSASSINATED IN THE CITY WAS IN FLAMES. HE WAS A GOOD FRIEND. I USED TO WORK ON THE EAST SIDE AND I GOT TO KNOW HICKS VERY WELL BECAUSE HE DID A LOT OF WORK OVER THERE AS WELL AND FOLKS HERE AT THIS CENTER ARE DOING GOD'S WORK THIS COMMUNITY CENTER GIVES PEOPLE HOPE AND A PLACE TO BELONG I SAW HOPE AS A SENATOR WHEN I WATCH MY SON BECOME ATTORNEY GENERAL HE WOULD ATTEND MASS AT SACRED HEART JUST UP THE STREET AND THEN WALK WITH HIS NOTEBOOK IN HAND SIT AROUND FOR THE DAY TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND WAYS TO HELP. AND ON THE EAST SIDE AS A TEENAGE LIFEGUARD MY CAREER AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER STARTED. AND HE IS NAMED AFTER MY BUDDY. WE WENT WAY BACK. WE JUST WALKED AROUND WILMINGTON AND EVERYBODY HAS A STORY ABOUT HICKS AND HOW HE CARED AND WAS THERE FOR YOU AND HOW TO BUILD A WONDERFUL FAMILY INCLUDING TWIN SONS WHO GAVE BACK SO MUCH TO THIS COMMUNITY AND CONTINUE TO DO. THEY SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY, NOW SERVING JOINTLY AS THE POET LAUREATES IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE. AND AS A STATE REPRESENTATIVE HICKS AND HIS FAMILY AND EVERYONE ELSE AT THE CENTER EMBODIES THE DEFINING STORY OF AMERICA. FOR GENERATIONS BLACK AND BROWN AND NATIVE AMERICAN AND IMMIGRANTS HAVE ALL PUSHED OUT AND NOT FULLY INCLUDED FROM THE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMY AND BY PURE CURE COURAGE AND GREAT THEY NEVER GAVE UP HIS THEY PURSUED THE FULL PROMISE OF AMERICA. THAT IS THE STORY OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY AND COUNTRY. THAT'S I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY ECONOMIC AGENDA. BOLD PLAN TO HELP BUILD A STRONGER AND MORE JUST AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY FOR EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY THIS TIME INCLUDED. AS A STORY OF TWO CIVIL RIGHTS ERA WE LOST LAST WEEK. ONE WHO SHOWS THE WAY FORWARD REACH THEIR SEPARATE WAYS. THE REVEREND WHO FACED DROWNINGS AND BEATINGS AND HIS COMMENT WAS YOU CANNOT TURN YOUR BACK ON THE IDEA OF JUSTICE. AND CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS WHO CROSSED THE EDMUND PETTIS BRIDGE ONE LAST TIME ON SUNDAY WHO ONCE SAID FREEDOM IS NOT A STATE IT'S AN ACT I WENT ACROSS THE BRIDGE TWICE ONCE WITH HIM AND I THOUGHT I KNEW A LOT ABOUT IT BUT UNTIL YOU WALK THAT BRIDGE AND SOME OF YOU HAVE DONE IT, AND YOU GET TO THE CREST OF THE BRIDGE THE FIRST TIME YOU CAN SEE DOWN THE OTHER SIDE DON'T WANT TO HIM A COUPLE YEARS AGO I THOUGHT IN GOD'S NAME DOES IT TAKE IN TERMS OF FORTITUDE AND COURAGE TO WALK DOWN THERE TO SEE THEM WITH CLUBS AND ON HORSES WAITING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BRIDGE WITH NO WAY BACK. I SPOKE TO JOHN JUST BEFORE HE DAD ON HIS DEATHBED. HE WANTED TO TALK AND INSTEAD OF MY CONCERNS FOR HIM HE ASKED ABOUT ME AND US AND ASK THAT WE STAY FOCUSED FOR THE WORK LEFT UNDONE TO HEAL THIS NATION AND REMAIN UNDAUNTED BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND ECONOMIC CRISIS TO TAKE THE BLINDERS OFF TO SHOW THE SYSTEMIC RACISM FOR WHAT IT IS THAT PLAGUES THIS NATION. PEOPLE HAVE SEEN NOW AND THEY ALLOWED THEM TO SHELTER IN PLACE ALL THOSE FOLKS RISKING THEIR LIVES STACKING SHELVES IN SUPERMARKETS. ALL OF THOSE FOLKS. FOR BLACK AND BROWN. ONE THING THE SENATE AND THE PRESIDENT CAN DO RIGHT AWAY IS PASS THE BILL TO RESTORE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. JUST YESTERDAY IT WAS RENAMED IN THE CONGRESS IN MEMORY OF JOHN LEWIS. WE HEARD SINCE HE PASSED TO BACK THAT WITH ACTION AND PROTECT THAT RIGHT TO VOTE HE WAS WILLING TO DIE FOR. I HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG IS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT ELECT. WE CANNOT LET THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO VOTE BE DENIED ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC AS IT RAGES ON. NEARLY 150,000 DEAD FROM COVID-19 AND COUNTING. MORE THAN 4 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE TESTED POSITIVE AND COUNTING. BLACK AND LATINOS ARE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED AND TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE FROM THE VIRUS. MORE THAN 30 MILLION AND COUNTING ARE COLLECTING UNEMPLOYMENT CHECKS BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT 50 PERCENT LATINO WITH - - 14.540 PERCENT OF BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES 401 - - 450,000 HAVE REPORTED THEY HAVE TO SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING IS WORSENED BY THE CRISIS BY THE PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. TO CHANGE THE TONE THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACTS OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS. DONALD TRUMP FACES A REAL TEST BUT HE HAS FAILED AT THE THRESHOLD TO BE PRESIDENT THE DUTY TO CARE FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY NOT JUST REELECTION PROSPECTS. HE SHOWS HE CANNOT BEAT THE PANDEMIC AND KEEP YOU SAFE. HE CANNOT TURN THE ECONOMY AROUND AND GET BACK TO WORK AND NOW NOT SURPRISINGLY STOKING THE FLAMES OF DIVISION AND RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE IS NO PLACE FOR VIOLENCE. PEACEFUL PROTESTERS SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN DO THAT. WHEN OBAMA AND I WERE POP THE OFFICE WE PROTECTED PROPERTY AND THEN TO TURN THAT INTO A PRIVATE MILITIA BUT THAT WOULD NOT HELP TRUMPS POLITICAL INTEREST. TO STOVE DIVISION IN CHAOS IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY. BUT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT CARE. THE CAMPAIGN IS FAILING AND HE'S LOOKING FOR A POLITICAL LIFELINE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT LAW AND ORDER BUT A STRATEGY TO REVIVE THE FEELING CAMPAIGN. TO ADD THAT FUEL TO THE FIRE IS THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED. BUT THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT GOING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE STRUGGLES. AND BUILDING A FUTURE WORTHY OF THEIR COURAGE AND AMBITION TO OVERCOME. LAST MONTH I STOPPED ADD A CHURCH AND I TALK TO A GROUP OF STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS WHO SHARE THEIR PAIN AND ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AT THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN POLITICS AND ECONOMY. IS JUST A SENSE THAT THE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST THE COMMUNITY. THE COMMON THEME IS HOW DO WE BREAK THE CYCLE? IN GOOD TIME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR STILL RISE IN BAD TIMES THEY ARE HIT FIRST AND HARDEST IN RECOVERY TAKES THE LONGEST TO BOUNCE BACK. THIS IS ABOUT JUSTICE. I PROPOSE POLICE REFORM AGENDA AND I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO SEE IT THROUGH AS PRESIDENT. IT'S ALSO ABOUT JOBS, GOOD PAYING JOBS, FINANCIAL STABILITY BUILDING WEALTH FOR FAMILIES OF COLOR AND PASSING IT DOWN TO THEIR KIDS IT'S ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR OUR COUNTRY AND OUTPERFORMING THE REST OF THE WORLD TO STAY AHEAD. IT'S ALSO ABOUT DIGNITY FOR WORKING PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. MANY OF YOU HEARD ME SAY BEFORE MY DAD HAD AN EXPRESSION THAT SAID YOUR JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN YOUR PAYCHECK. RICHARD DIGNITY AND RESPECT AND YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY LOOKING YOUR KID IN THE EYE TO SAY WILL BE OKAY AND MEAN IT. 50 PERCENT OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA DON'T THINK IT WILL BE OKAY THEY WILL NEVER HAVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING THAT THEY HAD. OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS I MADE MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN BASED ON NECESSITIES WE CAN'T JUST BUILD BACK TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE BUT BUILD BACK BETTER. WE NEED TO MAKE BOLD PRACTICAL INVESTMENTS TO RECOVER FROM THE ECONOMIC MESS WE ARE IN AND REBUILD THE FUTURE OUR COUNTRY DESERVES. TODAY I AM HERE TO EXPLAIN HOW THE BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN DEALS WITH SYSTEMIC RACISM AND RACIAL EQUITY IN THE ECONOMY. SO FAR THE BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN HAS THREE PARTS. FIRST, INVESTING IN AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND TECHNOLOGY SO THE FUTURE IS INCLUDING ALL AMERICANS NOT JUST THE SEVEN CITIES OF THE VAST MAJORITY. WITH MY PLAN WE WILL MOBILIZE THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT SINCE WORLD WAR II. CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS AND INCLUDE THE HISTORIC INVESTMENT AND PROCUREMENT WHICH IS GOODS AND SERVICES. UNDER MY PROPOSAL WE WOULD MAKE SURE THEY ARE AMERICAN MADE AN AMERICAN STEEL BUILDING TECHNOLOGY AND SO ON BUT FOR SO LONG FEDERAL CONTRACTING MEANT TO MANY BLACK AND BROWN ENTREPRENEURS AND BUSINESSES BUT MY PLAN MAKE SURE THAT CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS GET A FAIR SHOT WE WILL TRIPLE THOSE EGGS FIXED - - THE EXISTING BILLS FROM 5 PERCENT TO A MINIMUM OF 15 PERCENT BY 2025 IN CREATE JOBS AND GROW. WE CAN DO THAT. THE SECOND PLANK ADDRESSES OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLIMATE CHANGE WITH JOBS. INTO MANY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR STREET LIGHTS ARE OUT, SIDEWALKS ARE CRACKED SCHOOL BUILDINGS ARE OUTDATED AND UNSAFE. THERE IS NOWHERE YOU CAN BUY FRESH FOOD FOR MILES AWAY. AND FOLLOWING THEM TO THEIR ADULT LIFE AND ABANDONED HOME TO DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS TO GET THE ENERGY AND PRIDE AND ACHIEVEMENT OF COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. JUST IMAGINE IF WE COULD TRULY UNLEASH THE FULL POTENTIAL MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN MAKE SURE FAMILIES IN THESE COMMUNITIES ARE THE ONES WHO BENEFIT FROM HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FEDERAL INVESTMENT TAXPAYER DOLLARS HAVE TO BE INVESTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO PURCHASE THINGS. TO FILL THOSE CRACKS IN THE SIDEWALK. FOR YOU CAN DRINK CLEAN WATER AND BREATHE CLEAN AIR AND SHOP ADD A NEW ONE - - NEARBY GROCERY STORE. WE CANNOT REBUILD OUR ECONOMY AND ME THIS CLIMATE CRISIS UNLESS WE CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE IT'S ABOUT JOBS AND ALSO ABOUT DIGNITY AND PRIDE. THE THIRD PLANK IS THE CAREGIVERS WHO TAKE CARE OF LOVED ONES AND KIDS WE TRULY WANT TO REWARD THE WORK IN THIS COUNTRY TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF CARE. TO ELEVATE THE COMPASSION ON - - THE COMPASSION OF CAREGIVER WORKERS FAMILIES ARE SQUEEZED EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY. TRYING TO RAISE THEIR KIDS MY GUESS IS SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH THAT OF A PARENT WHO CANNOT TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. OR A YOUNG CHILD FROM THE AGE OF FIVE TRIES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT I HAD A GOOD SALARY I WAS MAKING $42000 A YEAR. WITHOUT MY FAMILY I CANNOT HAVE DONE IT. THEY NEED HELP THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT. AND THE PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS OUT THERE AND HOME HEALTH WORKERS WERE OFTEN WOMEN OF COLOR AND IMMIGRANTS THAT ARE TOO OFTEN UNDERPAID AND UNDERVALUED. THESE ARE THE THINGS WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO EASE THE BURDEN. MY PLAN WOULD CLEAR THE WAITING LIST OF 800,000 PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY CARE FOR A LOVED ONE THROUGH MEDICAID WHO SIGNED UP AND ARE WAITING. 800,000. MY PLAN WOULD MAKE SURE EVERY THREE AND FOUR -YEAR-OLD CHILD HAS ACCESS TO FREE HIGH-QUALITY PRESCHOOL MY STUDENTS HAVE AT THE CENTER. LIKE TITLE I SCHOOLS AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES WON'T SPEND MORE THAN 7 PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON CHILDCARE FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE. THE MOST HARD-PRESSED WORKING FAMILIES DON'T HAVE TO SPEND A DIME BECAUSE IT WOULD BE FREE. WE SUPPORT THE CAREGIVERS OVERWHELMINGLY ARE WOMEN OF COLOR. THE PLAN TO HELP THOSE WITHOUT COLLEGE DEGREES GAIN NEW SKILLS IN GOOD PAYING INDUSTRIES LIKE HEALTH CARE TO PROVIDE A PATHWAY. AND THEN TO HAVE ACCESS TO BECOME AN EMT OR NURSE OR PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT. WE WON'T JUST PUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION JOBS BUT FOR YET MILLIONS MORE TO REJOIN THE PAID WORKFORCE. AT LEAST 2 MILLION ADDITIONAL JOBS WILL BE CREATED AND MORE ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THE NATION. AND THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE WILL GROW. WE CAN DO THIS. TODAY I'M LAYING OUT A FOURTH PLAN OF MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN TO ADVANCE RACIAL EQUITY ACROSS THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. NOT JUST THE OTHER PILLAR OF BUILD BACK BETTER BUT TO START, WE CREATE A NEW SMALL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY FUND. THAT EXPANDS ON THE OBAMA BIDEN INITIATIVE GENERATING 5 BILLION IN PRIVATE EQUITY FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT OF A SMALL BUSINESS PARTICULARLY IN HARD-PRESSED AREAS. WE WILL TAKE $30 BILLION OF MAKE AMERICA INVESTMENT ANNOUNCED EARLIER THIS YEAR TO PUT IT INTO THIS FUND TO ALLOW THAT FEDERAL SUPPORT THE MOST PROGRAMS FOR FINANCING FOR MINORITY BUSINESS OWNERS. AND TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THANKS AND HAVE A PROVEN RECORD TO INVEST IN MINORITY AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THEN TO LEVERAGE 150 BILLION OF NEW FINANCING. SO THE SMALL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY FUND SUPPORTS AN INVESTMENT AND THEN TO COMMERCIALIZE NEW TECHNOLOGY. THAT HELPS THE MANUFACTURER GET STARTED AND THEN THE PROMISE TO THAT BUSINESS THAT HELPS MANUFACTURERS SCALE AND GROW. AND SO WE MAKE SURE THOSE ARE THE BEST IDEAS ARE NOT DENIED THE VENTURE CAPITAL BECAUSE OF RACE OR ZIP CODE. HERE IS WHY IT MATTERS. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO SMALL BUSINESSES OUR COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN. WHAT IS DONALD TRUMP DOING ABOUT IT? HE IS GIVING BIG BANKS THE GREEN LIGHT TO LOAN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS COVERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND MAKE $1 MILLION IN FEES BY SAVING THE MOST WELL-CONNECTED CLIENTS WHILE SHUTTING THE DOOR ON SMALLER BLACK AND BROWN BUSINESSES ABOUT THESE CONNECTIONS. YOU REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST LAID OUT WHAT I THOUGHT NEEDED TO BE DONE IN THE FIRST RECOVERY PLAN PUT FORWARD BY CONGRESS. I SAID THE PRESIDENT SHOULD USE THE AUTHORITY HE HAS OF THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO FORCE BIG BANKS TO HAVE TO LEND TO SMALL BUSINESSES. WE HAVE BAILED THEM OUT. WHAT DO THEY DO? DO YOU HAVE A CREDIT CARD WITH US HEAVY ESTABLISH CREDIT WITH US? A BANK ACCOUNT? THE LIST GOES ON. AND THEY ARE DENIED. THE RESULT? BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES BENEFIT ONCE YOU HAVE LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS WITH BETTER CONNECTED PHYSICIST JUMP AHEAD OF THE LINE AND BIG BANKS ACCOMMODATED. BLACK AND BROWN AND SMALL BUSINESSES GOT SHUT OUT IN FACT JUST 12 PERCENT OF BLACK AND BROWN BUSINESSES SURVEYED GOT THE AID THEY ASKED FOR. HALF SAY THEY WILL HAVE TO CLOSE UP SHOP AND THEY ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF EMPLOYMENT IN AMERICA. OUR ECONOMY CANNOT AFFORD FOR THEM TO CLOSE. UNDER MY PLAN, 50 PERCENT 50 OR FEWER EMPLOYERS RIGHT NOW WERE TALKING 500. DO YOU THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD STORES HAVE 500 EMPLOYEES AS A SMALL BUSINESS? SO MANY SMALL TOWNS AROUND AMERICA. TO SEE THEM SHUTTERED THESE MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESSES WITH THE WELL-CONNECTED BUSINESSES JUMP TO THE HEAD OF THE LINE. REMOVING THE BARRIERS FOR BLACK AND BROWN ENTREPRENEURS WE HAVE TO CLOSE THAT GAP OF THE NATION. AND BLACK AND BROWN HOMEOWNERSHIP IS ANOTHER. THERE ARE A NUMBER WHERE 75 PERCENT OF WHITE AMERICAN ONLY 25 PERCENT OF BLACK AND BROWN CITIZENS OWN THEIR HOMES. BUT EVEN IN THE MIDDLE THOSE THAT EXIST IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY ARE VALUED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS. AND TO SEE THE WEALTH ACCUMULATE MUCH MORE SLOWLY. MANY DIFFERENT FAMILIES IF THEY ACCUMULATE ANY ABILITY TO BORROW OR GENERATE WEALTH FROM THEIR HOME. THAT'S HOW WE SEND OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL TO BORROW AGAINST THAT. WHEN THE HOUSE IS AN ASSET TO BUILD EQUITY THE HOMEOWNERSHIP DISPARITY DENIES PEOPLE OPPORTUNITIES. MY HOUSING PLAN IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] BUT RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD. [INAUDIBLE] AND THE MORE AND MORE COST TO THE ECONOMY WHEN PEOPLE WITH CERTAIN NONVIOLENT CRIMINAL RECORDS CANNOT FULLY COMPUTE TO THEIR FULL TALENTS AND CAPACITY. IT WITH AN NONVIOLENT RECORD. AND THEN TO BE SPREAD ACROSS DIFFERENT COURT HOUSES. AND THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM AND IF THE STATE CHOOSES TO DO THAT. AND THEN TO ALLOW THEM TO KNOW HOW TO ORGANIZE. AND AS A REAL EQUITY. AND THEN WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOCUS ON EQUITY. AND THE FED HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY. AND THE EXISTING MANDATE PROMOTES MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT AND STABLE PRICES. UNDER MY PLAN I BELIEVE THE FED SHOULD ADD TO THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE PERSISTENT RACIAL GAPS IN JOBS AND WAGES OF GREATER DIVERSITY INCLUDING DIVERSE NOMINEES. AND THE REGIONAL FEDERAL BANKS. AND WHEN THE ECONOMY IS HELPING EVERYBODY RACIAL EQUITY IS NOT JUST AN ASPIRATION BUT A THEORY. ALL OF THOSE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WE MET A COUPLE IN HERE SOMEWHERE. WHERE ARE YOU SEE THAT YOUNG MAN RIGHT THERE AND HIS LOVELY WIFE. MOM AND DAD NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE SOMEONE GAVE HIM AN OLD LAPTOP COMPUTER. HE TOOK IT APART AND PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AND CHANGED HIS LIFE AT 17 HE WAS CERTIFIED TO BECOME AN IT SYSTEMS SPECIALIST. HE WENT TO COLLEGE STUDIED ABROAD AND CAME BACK HOME AND THEN STARTING A BUSINESS GETTING COMPUTERS TO FOLKS. WITH SEVEN EMPLOYEES AND HIS GOAL IS TO CREATE A WORKFORCE SOME OF THE PEOPLE HE HELPED WITH EIGHTH-GRADE EDUCATION NEVER USED A COMPUTER BEFORE FIVE WEEKS LATER THEY KNOW HOW. SO TO SCALE UP THE BUSINESS TO INVEST IN THE COMMUNITY THAT IS HEART AND GET AND NEVER GIVES UP AND THAT'S WHO WE ARE THAT IS WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT. WE ARE AMERICAN. WE DON'T SETTLE. WE ASPIRE AND WE SUCCEED I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. JESSICA? MR. VICE PRESIDENT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR VP PICK NARROWING IN ON THE TIME FRAME IF YOU'LL MAKE YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT ARE YOU STILL TARGETING EARLY AUGUST? HOW MANY FINALISTS DO YOU HAVE AN CAN YOU MEET WITH THEM IN PERSON BECAUSE OF COVID? I WILL NOT COMMENT ON EVERY STATE BUT WHEN THE RATE IS MORE THAN ONE \/ ONE IT SHOULD BE ROLLING BACK. LOOK, FROM THE BEGINNING, IN MY VIEW THE PRESIDENT GAVE US A FALSE CHOICE. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK AND DEAL WITH COVID YOU CANNOT GET THIS COUNTRY GOING AGAIN UNLESS YOU GET COVID UNDER CONTROL. HE HAS BEEN LATE IN THE GAME WE HAVE HEARD IT 100 TIMES COLUMBIA IS SHOWING ONE WEEK EARLIER 31000 MORE AND THEN 57000 BUT THE POINT IS THERE IS A FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY TO LAY OUT CLEAR GUIDELINES LIKE OPENING OUR SCHOOLS. THERE IS A NATIONAL CDC STRICT GUIDELINES AND SO I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW WITH FREEDOM VERSUS PHYSICAL SAFETY OF YOUR NEIGHBOR AND COMMUNICATION WITH THE VIRUS. EVEN NOW THEY ARE LOCKING DOWN COUNTIES ON TESTING. THE PRESIDENT SAID. TESTING SO WE WILL NOT KNOW. AND THEN TAKING ME INTO THE NEXT STAGE. I KNOW YOU COVER THIS A LOT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WE SAID WE SHOULD BE PUTTING TOGETHER RIGHT NOW $25 BILLION TO DO IT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A DETAILED PLAN ONCE A VACCINE IS FOUND GOD WILLING SOONER THAN LATER TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL AMERICA. IT IS A DIFFICULT AND LOGISTICAL THING TO DO WE SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT TESTING AND TRACING WE STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SO REALLY I PRAY THE PRESIDENT TAKES ADVANTAGE AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR SO THEY CAN BE DISTRIBUTED IN A WAY THAT DEALS WITH EVERY PART OF AMERICA BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO PLANNING THAT I CAN SEE. THIS IS MY HOME AND MAKING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IN SEATTLE WASHINGTON OR NEW MEXICO IT WOULDN'T MATTER THE SAME COVERAGE NO MATTER WHERE IT IS. AND THEN TO COMMUNICATE AND WORK WITH STAFF IN PHILADELPHIA TO GET THIS LINED UP AND WHAT I FOUND ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT HIDING IN THE BASEMENT? OVER 340 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE WATCHED WHAT WE HAVE DONE ON TELEVISION. SO THE WAY PEOPLE ARE ABSORBING THE NEWS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS BEFORE SO IT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENCE WHERE YOU DO IT FROM AS LONG AS WE DO IT SAFELY. IF I WERE IN WASHINGTON I WOULD COME HERE DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE BECAUSE OF MY BUDDY AND WHAT HE HAS DONE AND WHAT HE IS ALL ABOUT. THANK YOU SERVE TO BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT IS PROVOKING THESE THESE, YOU SAID THE PRESIDENTS INTENTIONALLY PROVOKING THE VIOLENCE WE HAVE SEEN IN THE CLASHES SPECIFICALLY BUT AND THE TELEVISION ADS THEY ARE RUNNING THEY WOULD SEE SIMILAR SCENES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT? AND WHAT SPECIFICALLY WOULD YOU BE DOING TO STRIKE THE BALANCE BETWEEN PEACEABLY ASSEMBLE AND THE DAMAGE TO PUBLIC PROPERTY WE ARE SEEING? USING LOCAL POLICE WHEN THEY ARRIVED TO THE FEDERAL PROPERTY. WE COULD TAKE CARE OF THE USE OF LOCAL POLICE. AND THAT ARSONIST SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE HAS CAUSED ENORMOUS POLITICAL DIVISION. HE SAYS BIDEN IS STOPPING 911. WITH MY PICTURE IN THE BACKGROUND OR IT COULD TAKE SEVEN DAYS. COME ON. THAT IS ALL ABOUT TRYING TO COME UP WITH A BIZARRE LAW AND ORDER 2020 CAMPAIGN TO SCARE THE DEVIL OUT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS LOOK, WHEN THE PRESIDENT DECIDES HE WANTS TO WALK THROUGH A GROUP OF PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATORS TO THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH TO HOLD THE BIBLE UPSIDE DOWN. I'M NOT SURE HOW OFTEN HE READS READS, AND HE USE THE MILITARY TO DO THAT, DID YOU EVER THINK THE CHAIRMAN OF JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF APOLOGIZING TO THE NATION FOR PARTICIPATING IN THAT? DID YOU EVER THANK YOU WORDS THE FORMER CHIEFS OF STAFF ABOUT DIVIDING THE COUNTRY? THAT WASN'T ABOUT WALKING ACROSS TO OF THE BIBLE. THAT WASN'T ABOUT THE CHURCH BURNING OR BEING BURNED. IT WAS ABOUT DIVIDING THE COUNTRY. WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT ALMOST THE SAME DAY TAKES THE CONFEDERATE FLAG OFF AND HE DEFENDS A CONFEDERATE FLAG AS A MATTER OF HERITAGE AND IT STILL BEING FLOWN AT NASCAR? WHY TAKE IT DOWN? THIS IS ABOUT DIVISION AND TRYING TO SPLIT THE COUNTRY. AND SO FAR, THANK GOD, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT HAVING ANY OF IT 70 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THINKING PROTESTERS TUESDAY BLACK LIVES MATTER THEY SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY DON'T CLING ONTO THE RACIAL THE VISION. AND THEN SAID THE MEXICAN RAPIST SO I DON'T THANK YOU NEED TO DO THAT BUT WE DO NEED TO HOLD THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE LAW ACCOUNTABLE HE SHOULD NEVER LET WHICH WAS DONE IN A MARCH FOR EQUAL RIGHTS OVERCOME THE REASON FOR THE MARCH. THAT'S WHAT THESE FOLKS ARE DOING. AND THEY SHOULD BE ARRESTED AND TRIED. IF I CAN AS YOU ROLL OUT THE ECONOMIC PLAN DURING THE COURSE OF THE PRIMARIES YOU WERE CRITICAL OF YOUR DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS FOR SUPPORTING PLANS YOU THAT WERE TOO EXPENSIVE AND NOT REALISTIC IN TERMS OF GETTING PAST. NOW YOU ARE PROPOSING $3 TRILLION OF SPENDING WITH YOUR ECONOMIC PLAN. DESCRIBE YOUR EVOLUTION IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU VIEW AS ACHIEVABLE IF YOU'RE ELECTED AND SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT. THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPEAKING NO ONE CAN BE A MILLIONAIRE IT'S A BAD THING OR THAT WE WILL PROVIDE A MEDICAL PLAN THAT COST $30 TRILLION OR $32 TRILLION AND YOU THANK YOU CAN GET IT PASSED. BEING ABLE TO PASS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, LEGISLATION THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE DEMONSTRATED IS NEEDED TO SOLVE REAL PROBLEMS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE IDEA THAT WE CAN CONTINUE FOR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS OVERSEAS TO MAKE PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TAX BREAKS SO WHEN WE COME UP SHORT WITH EVERYTHING AND NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THE KINDS OF STEEL WE NEED, IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN THAT. SO WE ARE USING FEDERAL DOLLARS TO FOCUS ON THINGS TO INCREASE INDEPENDENCE. WE DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON ANYONE ELSE FOR CYBERSECURITY OR CYBERINFORMATION OR TO MAKE THE BANISTERS WITH A STEEL BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT , THOSE THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY AND WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THEM AT HOME IS NOT INDUSTRIAL PLANNING ONLY WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO AND MY WHOLE PLAN RELATIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENT COMPANIES WILL NOT COME ALONG AND SPEND $1 TRILLION ON INFRASTRUCTURE TO REBUILD HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES CAUSING PEOPLE TO DIE MAKING SURE PORTS ARE ACCESSIBLE AND UNLOAD THEIR CARGO THE GOVERNMENT DOES THAT AND WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DOES THAT IT SHOULD BE INSISTING THAT USING THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT WE TAKE THE PRODUCT FROM THE AMERICAN MANUFACTURER MADE IN AMERICA TO EMPLOY AMERICAN WORKERS GETTING A DECENT WAGE. THAT'S A POLICY WHAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES ANYWAY YOU HEARD ME SAY BEFORE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHEN I'M PRESIDENT I ONE HERE AT THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD OWNED BY THE TAXPAYERS WHAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO? I THINK WE COULD OWN THE ELECTRICAL VEHICLE MARKET SO I WILL MOVE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE A CARBON NEUTRAL BUYING 550,000 CHARGING STATIONS UP AND DOWN THE HIGHWAYS. GENERATING THE KIND OF GROWTH AND UNION WAGES TO PROVIDE GOOD JOBS FOR PEOPLE. SO IT'S VERY DIFFERENT AND TO SAY WE WILL FIND ANOTHER $30 TRILLION AND GET THAT PASSED IN CONGRESS I PREDICT YOU WILL FIND I GET SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT THAT I THINK WILL HAPPEN AND WE WILL TAKE BACK THE UNITED STATES SENATE. AGAIN, WERE JUST SPENDING THE DOLLARS THAT ARE APPROPRIATED IN MANY CASES AND HOW WE SPEND THEM THEM. THANK YOU SERVE. IN YOUR REMARKS POLLING BEARS THIS OUT A LITTLE BIT BUT ARE YOU RUNNING AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP OR FOR JOE BIDEN? IN OTHER WORDS YOU ALLUDED TO THIS A LOT OF VOTERS ARE SAYING THAT THE SUPPORT HINGES ON THE FACT YOU ARE NOT THE PRESIDENT. SO WHY SHOULD THEY BE VOTING FOR YOU WERE NOT JUST AGAINST THE PRESIDENT? THAT'S WHY HAVE THIS DETAILED PLAN. [LAUGHTER] LOOK. I AM RUNNING BECAUSE TRUMP IS THE PRESIDENT AND I THINK OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE. FOR REAL. AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE IS MANY AMERICANS THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE ME AND THOSE WHO DO VIEW ME AS THE ANTITHESIS OF TRUCK. I BELIEVE THAT I AM. AND WHEN I ANNOUNCED AND SAID I WAS RUNNING TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA I MEANT IT. REMEMBER I GOT CRITICIZED FOR SAYING THAT NOW EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT DECENCY HONOR AND RESPECT AND THE SECOND REASON I SAID I WAS RUNNING IS BECAUSE EVEN BACK WHEN PEOPLE TALKED HOW WELL THE ECONOMY WAS MOVING I THOUGHT THE MIDDLE CLASS WAS STILL GETTING CRUSHED AND WORKING-CLASS FOLKS WERE HURTING BADLY. I SEE ANY NUMBER SHOWING THEY WERE SO HAPPY. BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE NOT ON - - THEY WERE BEING PAID BADLY IN CORPORATE AMERICA WAS OVERREACHING IN TERMS OF WHO HAD AN OBLIGATION AND THIRD WHAT I WAS MOST CRITICIZED FOR AS THAT WE HAD TO UNITE AMERICA THEY SAID YOU USED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED. WE CANNOT UNITE AMERICA WE ARE GONE. FORGET IT DEMOCRACY IS DEAD IT REQUIRES CONSENSUS. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE IT REQUIRES CONSENSUS THAT'S WHY I WOULD BE CRITICAL OF PEOPLE WHO SAY BY EXECUTIVE ORDER WILL DO THE FOLLOWING. THAT'S TRUMP HE HAS NO AUTHORITY TO DO THAT BY EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THE BAD NEWS BY ALL THE POLLS DONE ON YOUR NETWORK AND EVERYBODY ELSE. PEOPLE LOVE ME WARTS AND ALL. THE REASON I AM RUNNING IS BECAUSE I HAVE TWO QUALITIES AT THIS MOMENT ARE NOT THE MOST RELEVANT MEANING IN THE PRESIDENT CHANGES IN EVERY ELECTION IS DIFFERENT. ONE IS I KNOW FAR MORE ABOUT AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY WITH NATIONS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE ME RESPECT ME AND THOSE WHO DO LIKE ME RESPECT ME. I KNOW HOW TO GET THINGS DONE. IT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT I UNDERSTAND THE NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES. IS WHAT I'VE DONE MY WHOLE LIFE. TRUMP HAS NO NOTION OF IT. NONE. LISTEN TO HOW HE TALKS ABOUT PUTIN. MY GOD. IF HE TALKS TO HIM PRIVATELY BUT THEN RAISES THE FACT NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO I'VE BEEN RELATIVELY GOOD AT BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND POLITICALLY IT WILL BE A LOT HARDER. THINGS HAVE CHANGED. IT'S A LOT HARDER. BUT DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION IN TERMS OF THE SENATE AND THE RACES IT COULD BE WITHIN REACH BECAUSE I WILL SAY IT AGAIN I NEVER QUESTION ANYBODY'S MOTIVE FOR LIED TO A POLITICAL OPPONENT AND MISLED THEM EVEN SAYING I NEED YOUR VOTE BUT IF YOU DO THIS CONSTITUENT WILL BE MAD I DON'T EXPECT ANYBODY TO SAY IT'S PROFILES OF COURAGE I RECOGNIZE THEIR LIMITS AND STILL FIND A PRINCIPLED COMPROMISE THOSE ARE THINGS WE BADLY NEED NOW AND I THINK NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT I THINK I HAVE LAID OUT THE MOST DETAILED PLAN ON THE ECONOMY OF ANY PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY. IF I AM ELECTED I WILL GO DOWN ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE PRESIDENTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY BUT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE FREE MARKET AND CAPITALISM THAT REQUIRES CERTAIN SAFEGUARDS. IT TOOK A CAPITALIST TO SAVE CAPITALISM BUT I THINK THERE IS A LOT WE CAN GET DONE AND WILL GET DONE AND THAT'S WHY THE LAST THING I WILL SAY REMEMBER I WAS CRITICIZED BY SAYING TO CAMPAIGN IN THE STATES I CANNOT WIN BECAUSE WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT WHEN THE NATIONAL PARTY DOES NOT INVEST IN AREAS THERE IS A TIGHT RACE IT HURTS THE LOCAL OFFICIALS. SO WE HAVE TO BUILD A BENCH AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AS WELL. I'M HOPING THE PEOPLE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT I HAVE DONE, WHAT I'M PROPOSING, WHY IT'S IN THEIR INTEREST TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION I'M SUGGESTING. I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE SEE RESPONSE TO. I HAVE A QUICK COVARIATE QUESTION THE FOR THE MARLINS TODAY ANNOUNCED THEY HAVE TO SUSPEND THEIR SEASON AND YOU GET BRIEFINGS ON HOW COVERT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH AND SOCIETY SHOULD COMPORT ITSELF WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF SPORTS LEAGUES THAT ARE STARTING TO PLAY AGAIN OR WHAT SCHOOLS ARE CONSIDERING ALL OF THIS THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD WITHHOLD FEDERAL FUNDING FROM STATES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DON'T REOPEN. YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHTS ON ALL THIS. I DO I HAVE LAID IT OUT IT WILL GET YOU A COPY OF MY SCHOOL REOPENING PLAN WHAT IS REQUIRED. THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES YOU CAN DO THAT P-LETTER HAVE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO PROVIDE FOR PROTECTIVE GEAR AND SOCIAL DISTANCING AND TESTING AND ALL THOSE THINGS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND REQUIRES THE CERTAINTY THAT TEACHERS AS WELL AS STUDENTS WILL BE PROTECTED. IN A HIGH-INTENSITY AREA WITH A LOT OF COVARIATE IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. - - COVID-19 IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. DO YOU THINK HE DIDN'T GO TO TALLAHASSEE BECAUSE IT WAS NO LONGER THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC? TO GO TO FLORIDA OR JACKSONVILLE? KNOW BECAUSE THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT YOU DOING THIS. IT IS A MISTAKE. SO THERE ARE GUIDELINES THAT HAVE TO BE MADE MUCH MORE SPECIFIC BY THE CDC. THEY SHOULD LET THE SCIENTIST SPEAK. I'M HAPPY THE PRESIDENT IS BACK HOLDING HIS CONFERENCES EVERY DAY ON COVID-19. I KNOW A GOOD THAT DOES EXCEPT HE WEARS A MASK AND SAYS THE RIGHT THINGS MOSTLY BUT THIS IS ABOUT SCIENCE. AND EXPERTISE AND TRANSPARENCY. WE GOT TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS POINTING OUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SUCH EVEN WHEN BUSINESS OPENED PEOPLE DIDN'T SHOW UP BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK IT'S SAFE. SO THERE OUGHT TO BE A SYSTEM WHEREBY IN WHICH I PROPOSE YOU CAN LAY OUT THE DETAILS OF YOUR BUSINESS TO PUT A SIGN OUT THAT SAYS IT'S SAFE. I'VE MET ALL THE STANDARDS. BUT THE IDEA THAT WE JUST SAY OPEN AND PEOPLE WILL SHOW UP, THEY WILL NOT. THEY WILL NOT. IT SEEMS TO ME YOU PROBABLY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HAPPEN BASED ON WHAT THE LEAGUES THEMSELVES ARE SAYING. THE MARLINS SAY WE CAN'T DO IT. SO I THINK THEY SHOULD JUST FOLLOW THE SCIENCE WHAT SEEMS TO WORK A LITTLE BIT , BASKETBALL WERE NOBODY IS TRAVELING THEY ARE ALL SEQUESTERED IN ONE PLACE. IT'S LIKE, LOOK. MANY OF YOU HAVE FAMILIES MOMS AND DADS TO GO FROM WHEREVER YOU ARE TO THEIR STATE YOU SHOULD BE QUARANTINING BEFORE YOU GO SEE THEM. UP TO 12 DAYS. THINK ABOUT IT. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA YOU CANNOT TRAVEL TO EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. DON'T COME YOU ARE A DANGER TO US. BECAUSE WE DON'T FOLLOW THE SCIENCE. THERE IS VERY LITTLE TRANSPARENCY WITH WHAT'S GOING ON BUT I HAVE CONFIDENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN YOU HAVE FOOTBALL PLAYERS MAKING EIGHT OR 10 MILLION BUCKS PER YEAR SAYING IT WILL NOT TAKE THE RISK TO PLAY YOU HAVE TO LISTEN. I'M NOT GONNA SAY EVERY SPORT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME IF YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL AND YOU HAVE TO BE IN HOTEL ROOMS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE DAY BEFORE AND IN A POSITION GOING INTO AN AREA WITH A HIGH CONCENTRATION TO SPREAD COVID , THAT ADDS UP TO A REAL PROBLEM. AND WE CANNOT OVERCOME THAT UNTIL WE FOLLOW THE SCIENCE AND GET A VACCINE. I WILL SAY IT AGAIN. THE PRESIDENT, AS WE SPEAK SPEAK, SHOULD BE STARTING AND SHOULD'VE STARTED THREE MONTHS AGO TO PUT SOMEONE IN CHARGE HOW SPECIFICALLY LIKE HOW TO WAGE A WAR, HOW WILL YOU DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINE WHEN IT ARRIVES? WHEN IT'S THEY ARE? AND THE QUESTION IS IT REQUIRES ENORMOUS TRANSPARENCY. TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO OTHER EXPERTS ACROSS THE NATION SO THIS IS A SAFE VACCINE. ONE PERCENTAGE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFE IT WAS THEY ARE TOMORROW THEY WOULDN'T TAKE IT AND IT'S NOT THE USUAL ANTI- VACCINE CROWD. IT IS BEYOND THAT. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LOSING FAITH IN WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS. . . . .

COMING UP FRIDAY MORNING, WE WILL DISCUSS THE FEDERAL MORATORIUM ON EVICTIONS AND THE LOW INCOME HOUSING COALITION PRESIDENT. AND MOODY'S ANALYTICS CHIEF ECONOMIST WILL BE WITH US TO TALK ABOUT THE STATE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY. WATCH \"WASHINGTON JOURNAL\" LIVE AT 7:00 EASTERN FRIDAY MORNING. JOIN THE DISCUSSION WITH YOUR PHONE CALLS, FACEBOOK COMMENTS, TEXT MESSAGES, AND TWEETS. NEXT, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN SPEAKING TO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LATINO ELECTED OFFICIALS. THE GROUP IS HOLDING ITS ANNUAL CONFERENCE BY VIDEO BECAUSE OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I WANT TO SAY A SPECIAL HI TO MY GOOD FRIEND SECRETARY DAILY. IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME. GLAD TO SEE YOU LOOKING SO WELL. I'M HONORED TO BE WITH YOU ALL TODAY AND I WANT TO START BY THANKING ARTURO FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY VISION FOR LATINOS IN OUR COUNTRY. IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPENING REMARKS. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY. NONE MORE STARK THAN THE LAST 3.5 YEARS. DONALD TRUMP HIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE PURSUED AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT ON LATINO COMMUNITIES, FROM THE MOMENT HE CAME DOWN THAT GOLDEN ESCALATOR SAYING HE WAS GOING TO TAKE ON THE MEXICAN RAPISTS. IT STARTED THE MOMENT HE ANNOUNCED HIS PRESIDENCY. FEEDING THE FLAMES OF FEARS AND RACISM AGAINST LATINOS. IT IS BAKED INTO EVERY ASPECT OF HOW HE HAS GOVERNED. THIS WEEK WAS AN ESPECIALLY POIGNANT REMINDER OF THE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF ALLOWING THAT KIND OF HATE TO GROW UNCHECKED. I THOUGHT WE COULD DEFEAT A, BUT IT ONLY HIDES UNDER THE ROCKS. WHEN A PRESIDENT BREATHES OXYGEN IN, IT COMES ROARING OUT. ON MONDAY, WE MARKED THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGIC MASS SHOOTING IN EL PASO WHERE A GUNMAN EXPLICITLY SOUGHT TO TARGET LATINOS AND 23 BEAUTIFUL LIVES WERE STOLEN FROM US AND THEIR FAMILIES. I KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO LOSE A CHILD. IT IS AWFUL. IT IS STARKLY , THE STAKES OF TRUMP'S IRRESPONSIBLE POLICIES, OF DIVISION AND HATE THAT HE PROMOTES ISRAEL. , IS REAL. THESE ARE LIFE-AND-DEATH DECISIONS. WHETHER IT IS REPEATED ATTACKS ON DREAMERS OR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. WHETHER IT IS HIS NEGLECT OF PEOPLE AFTER HURRICANE MARIA AND PUERTO RICO FOR HIS REPEATED FAILURE TO MAKE SURE ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAVE THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED, DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED THE LATINO COMMUNITY TIME AND TIME AGAIN. SO, THE QUESTION YOU ASKED, ARTURO, HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE REAL A BETTER LIFE FOR LATINOS? THAT IS THE KEY QUESTION. THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY LITERALLY DEFENDS ON HOW WE ANSWER IT. THAT IS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. HERE IS THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH. THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE LATINOS HAVE THE ABILITY AND TOOLS TO SUCCEED. LATINOS ARE THE FASTEST GROWING POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES. ALREADY ONE QUARTER OF OUR SCHOOLCHILDREN, ONE QUARTER ARE LATINO. HOW IN GOD'S NAME CAN WE HAVE A STRONG AND THRIVING REPUBLIC IF WE DON'T FULLY DEAL LATINOS INTO EVERY ASPECT OF AMERICAN LIFE. THESE KIDS ARE NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S KIDS. THE KITE STRINGS THAT LIFT OUR NATIONAL AMBITION. THAT IS WHY EARLIER THIS WEEK I RELEASED MY LATINO AGENDA. THINGS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON ALL ALONG AND YOU KNOW ABOUT, BUT I PUT THEM ALL IN ONE PLACE. IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR NOT JUST HOW WE ARE GOING TO UNDO ALL THE HARM THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS INFLICTED, BUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE LATINOS ARE INCLUDED IN OUR PLANS TO BUILD THAT MEANS INVESTING IN LATINO ECONOMIC MOBILITY, BECAUSE THAT IS THE BASIS OF IT ALL, ECONOMIC MOBILITY. EVERYTHING MAKING SURE LATINO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CAN ACCESS CAPITAL TO MAKING IT EASIER FOR LATINO FAMILIES TO BUY A HOME, TO BUILD INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH. HOW DID EVERY OTHER MIDDLE-CLASS PERSON DO IT? THEY WERE ABLE TO BUY A HOME AND BUILD EQUITY IN A HOME AND PASS IT ON FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. ONE OF THE FOUR PLANKS OF MY BILL BACK BETTER PLAN IS ABOUT ADDRESSING RACIAL INEQUITIES. IT IS ABOUT BREAKING THE CYCLE WE ARE IN GOOD TIMES LATINO COMMUNITIES STILL LAG BEHIND AN EVENT TIMES , IN A RECOVERY, THEY TAKE THE LONGEST TO BOUNCE BACK TO WHERE THEY WORK, WHICH WAS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN WITH. WE WILL USE EVERY TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL TO TAKE ON INEQUITIES. IT ALSO WORKS ON ENDING RACE-BASED HEALTH DISPARITIES. TINO'S ARE AMONG THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WITH MILLIONS GETTING INSURANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME. NOW THE INSURANCE RATE DROPPED FROM 32% TO 19%. THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT WIN FOR THE LATINO COMMUNITY. IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC, WITH ALMOST 160,000 DEAD, THOSE FAMILIES LOST, PART OF THEIR SOUL, PART OF THEIR HEART. NOW TRUMP IS TRYING TO STRIP PEOPLE OF THEIR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN COURT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. LATINOS ARE BURYING SOME OF THE HEAVIEST BURDENS. DUE TO HIGH RATES OF INFECTION BECAUSE LATINOS DISPROPORTIONATELY SERVE IN CAREGIVING ROLES AND INCREASE THE RISK OF EXPOSURE AND SAVE OTHER PEOPLE. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE. I AM GOING TO PROTECT OBAMA CARE AND BUILD ON IT WITH A PUBLIC OPTION SO EVERY SINGLE PERSON CAN HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY AFFORDABLE CAL , HEALTH CARE. WHEN IT COMES TO FIGHTING THIS PANDEMIC, WE HAVE TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR. EVERYONE GETS FREE ACCESS TO TESTING AND TREATMENT. WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE, A VACCINE. EVERYONE GETS IT. WE HAVE TO FIGHT THIS VIRUS WITHOUT REGARD TO IMMIGRANT STATUS. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE WILL BEAT THIS THING. IT IS THE ONLY HUMANE THING TO DO. WE WILL ALSO EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION AND TAKE ON THE RACIAL INEQUITIES IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. THAT STARTS EARLY TO MAKE SURE HIGH-QUALITY PRE-K IS AVAILABLE TO EVERY CHILD THREE AND FOUR YEARS OLD. STUDIES SHOW THAT IT INCREASES EXPONENTIALLY THE PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS FOR THE ENTIRE 12 YEARS. IT GOES THROUGH MAKING POST HIGH SCHOOL AFFORDABLE , POST HIGH SCHOOL IS AFFORDABLE FOR STUDENTS. PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE TUITION FREE FOR MAKING LESS THAN $10025,000 REWARD. DOUBLING PELL GRANTS, INCREASING FUNDING FOR HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTIONS. I STARTED TODAY BY SPEAKING ABOUT THE TRAGEDY IN EL PASO ONE YEAR AGO. WE ALSO NOTE LATINOS SUFFER EVERY DAY FROM HATE CRIMES AND GOOD VIOLENCE. IT DOES NOT ALWAYS MAKE NATIONAL HEADLINES. UNDER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL GET WEAPONS OF WAR AND HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I WILL TAKE THE FIGHT DIRECTLY TO THE NRA AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSE , AND HOLD GUN MANUFACTURERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSE TO LATINO FAMILIES. TRUMP FAILS TO UNDERSTAND THE BASIC TRUTH OF IMMIGRANTS, THAT THEY ARE AN INCREDIBLE SOURCE OF OUR NATION'S STRENGTH AND THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN, ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1860'S WHEN MY ANCESTORS JUMPED ONTO THE SEA, NOT KNOWING WHERE THEY WERE GOING, NOT KNOWING WHETHER THEY WOULD MAKE IT A SHORT, ALL THE WAY TODAY , WAY TO TODAY. WE ARE ABLE TO SHARE THE BEST OF EVERY CULTURE. IT TAKES COURAGE TO LEAD A COUNTRY OF EVERY KIND, OF EVERY BACKGROUND. THAT IS WHY WE ARE WHO WE ARE. UNLIKE THE PRESIDENT, WE WILL IMMEDIATELY AND TRUMPS ASSAULT ON THE DIGNITY OF AMERICA , TRUMP'S ASSAULT ON THE DIGNITY OF AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. OUR COUNTRY IS A SAFE PLACE FOR ASYLUM-SEEKERS, THOSE FLEEING PERSECUTION. WE HAVE NEVER MADE ASYLUM-SEEKERS SEEK ASYLUM OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE WILL STOP THE UNION MADE PRACTICE , INHUMANE PRACTICE OF SEPARATING FAMILIES FROM THEIR CHILDREN. WE WILL STOP , AND DID BEST CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO HELP ENSURE MIGRANTS GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED WHILE THEY ARE NAVIGATING THE ASYLUM PROCESS. IT WILL COST A LOT OF MONEY, BUT IT IS A HELL OF A LOT CHEAPER THAN BUILDING A WALL. WE WILL RESTORE SENSIBLE ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES AND STOP TERRORIZING LATINO COMMUNITIES. THE IDEA YOU WAIT OUTSIDE AT 10:00 MASS TO GRAB SOMEONE FROM A CHURCH, THE ANXIETY FROM CHILDREN. THE ANXIETY IS OVERWHELMING. IT WILL HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT UPON THE GENERATION. WE WILL PROTECT DREAMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND EVERY SINGLE AGREEMENT THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SIGNED 2 , LAW IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS. IMMIGRATION FOR , REFORM WILL FOCUS ON KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER. INCLUDING PROVIDING A CLEAR ROADMAP FOR 11 MILLION , FOR CITIZENSHIP FOR 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. I KNOW THAT IS A PRETTY BIG AGENDA. THIS IS THE MOMENT TO GET IT DONE. THE PANDEMIC AS LIFTED BLINDERS OFF SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ON WHO IS REALLY ESSENTIAL TO OUR ECONOMIC STRATEGY. IT IS NOT WALL STREET BANKERS OR CEOS, IT IS THE MIDDLE CLASS, HARD-WORKING UNION MEMBERS COMMITTED TO THE RIGHTS OF ALL WORKERS, FOLKS AND LATINO COMMUNITIES WHO ARE BUSTING THEIR NECKS EVERY DAY TO KEEP THE COUNTRY RUNNING. AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE WE ARE READY TO CLOSE THE RISK AT , THE RESPECT CAP, THE OPPORTUNITY GAP. SOME OF THOSE LATINO WORKERS HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FOR SO LONG. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, WHEN HE LOST A JOB UP IN SCRANTON. MY DAD NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE. HE IS TO SAY, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, HONOR. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK A KID IN THE EYE AND SAY IT IS GOING TO BE OK. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. DIGNITY, HONOR, TREATING PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY. WE CAN BUILD A NEW ADMINISTRATION THAT RESPECTS THE FULL DIVERSITY OF OUR NATION AND THE FULL DIVERSITY OF LATINO COMMUNITIES. WHEN I MEAN FULL DIVERSITY, UNLIKE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES AND THE COMMUNITIES, BUT FROM EVER. FROM EUROPE TO SOUTH AMERICA ALL THE WAY TO OUR BORDER WITH MEXICO AND THE CARIBBEAN. AND DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS, DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES, BUT ALL LATINOS. WE WILL GET A CHANCE TO DO THAT WHEN WE WIN IN NOVEMBER. THE REASON WE NEED EVERYONE TO GET OUT AND ABOUT, I CANNOT DO THIS WITHOUT YOUR HELP. THE VICTORY IN NOVEMBER IS CONTINGENT UPON LATINO VOTERS, PARTICULARLY IN BATTLEGROUND STATES. I AM COMMITTED TO SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THE LATINO COMMUNITY . I HAVE A SIGNIFICANT STEP. WE ARE TRYING TO ADVERTISE ON LATINO STATIONS, SPANISH-SPEAKING STATIONS. WE NEED EVERY SINGLE VOTER TO SIGN UP, GET ENGAGED IN OUR CAMPAIGN. WE NEED YOU TO GET OUT AND VOTE WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS. MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO REGISTER AND HOW TO VOTE SAFELY DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE NEED TO PROVIDE VOTERS WITH MORE OPTIONS, NOT FEWER AND TO EXPAND OPTIONS. NO EXCUSE FOR ABSENTEE BALLOTS. YOU CAN GET AN ABSENTEE BALLOT IF YOU NEED ONE OR WANT ONE. HAVE ENOUGH FOR WORKERS THAT CAN SANITIZE MACHINES AND MAKE SURE WE CAN SOCIALLY DISTANCE AND WEAR MASKS WHILE NOT TAKING AWAY MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. OUR CAMPAIGN IS PUTTING TOGETHER THE LARGEST VOTER PROTECTION PROGRAM IN HISTORY BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE TO. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE IMPACT THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON VOTING RIGHTS AND VOTING DURING THE PRIMARIES. WE KNOW VOTER SUPPRESSION WAS ALIVE AND WELL IN AMERICA BEFORE THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. THE CENSUS IS PART OF THIS TOO. EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE COUNTED. FOUR FORMER CENSUS BUREAU DIRECTORS WHO HAVE WORKED UNDER NINE PRESIDENTS HAVE CALLED ON THE SENATE AND ADMINISTRATION TO WORK TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE SO WE GET AN ACCURATE COUNT. YOU MENTIONED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. TO DATE, IT HAPPENS TO BE THE 55TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS ENACTMENT. I WORK LIKE HELL TO EXTEND THAT ACT WHEN I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE. THROUGHOUT MY CAREER GOING BACK TO 1975. BACK THEN, IN 2013 THE SUPREME COURT CAME ALONG AND STRIPPED THE TEETH OUT OF THE ACT. THEY SAID IT WAS NO LONGER NECESSARY. JUST LAST YEAR, 29 STATES INTRODUCED OR CARRIED OVER BILLS TO TRY TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE, PERIOD. THIS IS BLATANTLY UN-AMERICAN. OUR DEMOCRACY, ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE, THAT IS THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE. AND AT THE SENATE, REPUBLICAN SENATE, MITCH MCCONNELL AND DONALD TRUMP DO NOT TAKE UP THE BILL NEWLY RENAMED IN HONOR OF MY FRIEND JOHN LOTUS TO RESTORE THE ACT TO ITS FULL POWER, I WILL DO THAT ON MY FIRST DAY AS PRESIDENT. WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THANK YOU AGAIN, ARTURO, AND EVERYONE AT VALEO FOR WHAT YOU WERE DOING. TO MAKE THE COUNTRY STRONGER. YOU MAKE US ALL BETTER. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. THE COUNTRY IS BETTER, STRONGER, OR PROSPEROUS, MORE DECENT, MORE HONORABLE IF WE IN FACT REACH OUT AND GET THE LARGEST POPULATION OF IMMIGRANTS IN THE WORLD, IN THE UNITED STATES AND INCLUDE THEM ACROSS THE BOARD. IT IS A SOURCE OF AMAZING STRENGTH FOR US. I THINK BECAUSE OF THIS OPEN PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS, I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SEEING THAT NOW. AT LEAST I HOPE THAT IS THE CASE. I AM GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP TO GET ALL OF THIS DONE. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?474519-101\/joe-biden-naleo-virtual-conference","Summary":"Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, delivered remarks at the 37th annual conference of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO).

HE'S BEEN IN THE COURTS FIGHTING THIS FOR YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, HE GOT TESTIMONY FROM PEOPLE WHO WORKED AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD, THAT THEY SOLD ABORTED BABY BODY PARTS FOR PROFIT. THEY ALSO CHANGED THE ABORTION PROCEDURE TO GIVE BETTER PARTS , HELLO, HELLO. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. I WISH WE WERE ABLE TO TALK TO FOLKS OUTSIDE, BUT WE ARE KEEPING OUR SOCIAL DISTANCING AND PLAYING BY THE RULES. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. TO ME AND TO KAMALA, THIS IS AN EXCITING DAY. THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR OUR CAMPAIGN AND A GREAT GAME FOR , GREAT DAY FOR AMERICA, IN OUR VIEW. I HAVE HAD THE INCREDIBLE PRIVILEGE WITH MEETING AND SPENDING TIME WITH A TALENTED GROUP OF WOMEN LEADERS, ALL OF WHOM ARE QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT. WITH EACH ONE, THE MORE I LEARN ABOUT THEM, THE MORE I TALK TO THEM, THE MORE IMPRESSED I WAS, EVEN THOUGH I KNEW THAT BEFORE. I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM FOR BEING PART OF THIS PROCESS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AS WE REBUILD THIS COUNTRY, TO GET ELECTED AND ONCE WE ARE ELECTED, GOD WILLING. I APPROACH THIS WITH A SERIOUSNESS, A PURPOSE AND A MIND, BECAUSE THIS IS A SERIOUS MOMENT FOR OUR NATION. WE ARE AT ONE OF THOSE INFLECTION POINTS , YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THAT BEFORE IN OUR HISTORY. A LIFE-CHANGING ELECTION FOR THIS NATION. THE CHOICE , THE CHOICE WE MAKE THIS NOVEMBER IS GOING TO DECIDE THE FUTURE OF AMERICA FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME. AND I HAD A GREAT CHOICE, GREAT OPPORTUNITIES. I HAD A GREAT CHOICE, BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I PICKED THE RIGHT PERSON TO JOIN ME AS THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND THAT'S SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS. IT SEEMS THAT AMERICANS ALL ACROSS THIS NATION, AT LEAST AT THE OUTSET HERE, AGREE WITH ME. YESTERDAY WE HAD OUR BEST GRASSROOTS FUNDRAISING DAY OF THE CAMPAIGN, MORE THAN DOUBLE OUR PREVIOUS RECORD, AND IN DOING SO WE SET A SINGLE DAY RECORD FOR ONLINE POLITICAL FUNDRAISING. I THINK I KNOW I. , I KNOW WHY. I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US AS WELL, THOSE WHO LISTEN TODAY. GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM TODAY. FIVE DOLLARS, $10, WHATEVER. KAMALA IS SMART, SHE IS TOUGH, EXPERIENCED. SHE IS A PROVEN FIGHTER FOR THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS. ARE ALL THOSE STRUGGLING TO GET INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS, KAMALA KNOWS HOW TO GOVERN. SHE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE THE HARD CALLS. SHE IS READY TO DO THIS JOB ON DAY ONE. WE ARE BOTH READY TO GET TO WORK REBUILDING THIS NATION AND BUILDING IT BETTER. AS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE LARGEST STATE IN THE COUNTRY, KAMALA TOOK ON THE BIG BANKS OVER MORTGAGE FRAUD AND WON. TOOK ON BIG OIL, WHO WANTED TO POLLUTE WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES. SHE IS A PIONEER IN MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND TACKLED THE GUN LOBBY. YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALL WATCHED THE UNITED STATES SENATE GO TOE TO TOE WITH TRUMP OFFICIALS, TRYING TO HIDE THE TRUTH, ASKING THE TOUGH QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ASKED AND NOT , , BUT AS A MEMBER OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, SHE HAS BEEN THE SENATOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOST MASSIVE SECURITY CHALLENGES OUR COUNTRY FACES. WELL AWARE, WELL AWARE OF ALL THE THREATS TO THIS NATION AND READY TO RESPOND TO THEM. AS A CHILD OF IMMIGRANTS, SHE KNOWS PERSONALLY HOW IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ENRICH OUR COUNTRY, AS WELL AS THE CHALLENGES OF WHAT IT MEANS TO GROW UP BLACK AND INDIAN-AMERICAN IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE AMERICA , IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HER STORY IS DIFFERENT FROM MINE AND MANY PARTICULARS, BUT NOT SO DIFFERENT IN THE ESSENTIALS. SHE HAS WORKED HARD, SHE HAS NEVER BACKED DOWN FROM A CHALLENGE, AND SHE HAS EARNED EACH AND EVERY OF THE ACCOLADES AND ACHIEVEMENTS THAT SHE HAS GAINED, MANY OF THEM OFTEN IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES THAT OTHERS PUT IN HER WAY, BUT NEVER QUIT. THIS MORNING, ALL ACROSS THE NATION, LITTLE GIRLS WOKE UP, ESPECIALLY LITTLE BLACK AND BROWN GIRLS, WHO SO OFTEN FEEL OVERLOOKED AND UNDERVALUED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES, BUT TODAY , TODAY, JUST MAYBE, THEY ARE SEEING THEMSELVES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A NEW WAY, AS THE STUFF OF PRESIDENTS AND VICE PRESIDENTS. IN HER CAMPAIGN IN THE PRIMARY, KAMALA OFTEN TALKED ABOUT THE 3:00 A.M. AGENDA, THE MOMS AND DADS AWAKE LATE AT NIGHT IN THEIR KITCHENS, WORRIED, SCARED, UNCERTAIN ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES, ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO PAY THE BILLS, ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO SIMPLY MAKE IT. GROWING UP IN SCRANTON IN CLAYMONT, DELAWARE, I SAW THAT STRUGGLE WITH MY FAMILY AS WELL AS HE KAMALA SAW IT WITH HERS AS WELL. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE LIVING THAT STRUGGLE AS WE SPEAK, ESPECIALLY IN THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS. ESPECIALLY WITH SO MANY JOBS LOST. KAMALA AND I BOTH KNOW JUST GIVE ME A SHOT, A FAIR SHOT. A SHOT AT MAKING IT. AND IT WILL BE THE WORK OF OUR ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THEY GET A FAIR SHOT. WORKING FAMILIES NEED SOMEONE ON THEIR SIDE IN THIS NATION, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN THE PRESIDENT NOW ON THEIR SIDE. THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE IN A BIDEN HARRIS ADMINISTRATION. IT IS GOING TO BE GRATIFYING TO SEE THE STRONG, ENTHUSIASTIC REACTION TO SENATOR HARRIS AS OUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, IT COMES FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. IT IS ALREADY OCCURRING. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, ALL IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS, ALL BACKGROUNDS. EVENTS, WE ARE PREDICTABLE AND SOME OF THEM. IT COMES FROM ALL OTHER EXCEPT FOR DONALD TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE AND HIS ALLIES. WE ALL KNEW IT WAS COMING. YOU COULD HAVE SET YOUR WATCH IS TO IT. DONALD TRUMP HAS ALREADY STARTED HIS ATTACKS, CALLING KAMALA NASTY, WHINING ABOUT SHE IS MEAN TO HER APPOINTEES. IT IS NO SURPRISE, BECAUSE WHINING IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP DOES BEST, BETTER THAN ANY AMERICAN PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. IS ANYONE SURPRISED DONALD TRUMP AS A PROBLEM WITH A STRONG WOMAN OR WOMEN ACROSS THE BOARD? LET'S BE CLEAR. IF YOU ARE A WORKING PERSON WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER YOU WILL HAVE A JOB TO GO TO, WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PAY YOUR MORTGAGE, YOUR RENT, WORRIED ABOUT THE POISON IN THE AIR YOU BREATHE, THE WATER YOU DRINK, WORRIED ABOUT YOUR CIVIL RIGHTS, YOUR RIGHTS TO BASIC DIGNITY, WHICH IS UNDER ATTACK BY THIS ADMINISTRATION, KAMALA HARRIS HAS HAD YOUR BACK, AND NOW WE HAVE TO HAVE HER BACK. SHE IS GOING TO STAND WITH ME IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND ALL OF US ARE GOING TO STAND UP FOR HER. ON JANUARY 20, 2021, WE WILL WATCH SENATOR HARRIS RAISE HER RIGHT HAND AND SWEAR THE OATH OF OFFICE AS THE FIRST WOMAN EVER TO SERVE AS THE SECOND HIGHEST OFFICE IN AMERICA, IN THIS LAND. AND THEN WE WILL GET TO WORK FIXING THE MESS THAT PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAVE CREATED, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD THROUGH FOUR YEARS OF MISMANAGEMENT AND MODELING OF TERRORISTS AND THUGS AROUND THE WORLD. NOT ONLY WILL AMERICA DIG ITSELF OUT OF HIS HOLD A PUT US IN, WE WILL BUILD BACK. WE WILL BUILD BACK BETTER. WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. KAMALA HARRIS IS IN COURT , DONALD IS IN COURT TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH HEALTH CARE. I 165,000 PEOPLE DEAD AND CLIMBING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF COVID-19, AND STILL MONTHS LATER, NO REAL LEADERSHIP OR PLAN FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HOW TO GET THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL. NO REAL HELP FOR THE STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRYING TO FILL THE VACUUM OF LEADERSHIP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. NO REAL HELP FOR CHILDREN AND EDUCATORS OR SMALL BUSINESSES AND FRONT-LINE WORKERS HOLDING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER. INSTEAD, HE IS ISSUING EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND MAKING PROMISES THAT IN THE END WILL DEFUND THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM WHILE INSISTING THAT THIS VIRUS WILL DISAPPEAR. THE JOE BIDEN KAMALA HARRIS ADMINISTRATION WILL HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF COVID-19 AND TURNED THE CORNER ON THIS PANDEMIC. MASKING, CLEAR SCIENCE-BASED GUIDANCE, DRAMATICALLY SCALING UP TESTING, GETTING STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO OPEN SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES SAFELY. WE CAN DO THIS. WE JUST NEED A PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT WILLING TO LEAD AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. NOT AS THIS PRESIDENT SAYS, IT IS NOT MY FAULT. THE GOVERNORS SHOULD THANK ME MORE. AS THE OLD SAYING GOES, GIVE ME A BREAK. WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. MORE THAN 16 MILLION AMERICANS, 16 MILLION STILL OUT OF WORK. DONALD TRUMP IS ON TRACK TO BREAK ANOTHER RECORD, ON TRACK TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH THE WORST JOBS RECORD OF ANY AMERICAN PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY, BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THE HARD WORK, MEETING FACE-TO-FACE WITH CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE WHITE HOUSE LIKE EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN A CRISIS TO GET AMERICANS THE RELIEF THEY NEED AND DESERVE, DONALD TRUMP IS ON THE GOLF COURSE. IF I TOLD YOU THIS THREE YEARS AGO, YOU WOULD LOOK AT ME LIKE I WAS BEING CRAZY. HE HAS NOT EVEN MET WITH THE LEADERSHIP. SHE DOES NOT HAVE TIME, IT APPEARS. WE HAVE A CLIMATE CRISIS, AND DONALD TRUMP REFUSES TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE. WHEN HE THINKS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, ALL WE HEAR IS THE WORD HOAX. A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION WILL MEET THE CLIMATE CRISIS, PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND ALONG THE WAY, WE WILL DELIVER ONE WORD, JOBS. GOOD PAYING JOBS. WE HAVE A RACIAL JUSTICE CRISIS. DONALD TRUMP SEEKS ONLY TO INFLAME IT WITH THIS POLITICS OF RACIST RHETORIC AND APPEALS TO THE VISION. TODAY IS NOT ONLY THE DAY I AM PROUD TO INTRODUCE SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS AS THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE OF THE PARTY, IT IS ALSO THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, REMEMBER? REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO SEE THOSE NEO-NAZIS AND THOSE KLANSMEN, WHITE SUPREMACISTS COMING OUT OF FIELDS CARRYING LIGHTED TORCHES, FACES CONTORTED, BULGING VEINS, POURING INTO THE STREETS OF HISTORIC AMERICAN CITIES SPEWING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BIO WE HEARD IN HITLER'S GERMANY IN THE 1930'S. REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT TO SEE A VIOLENT CLASH ENSUE BETWEEN THOSE CELEBRATING HATE AND THOSE STANDING AGAINST IT? IT WAS A WAKE-UP CALL FOR ALL OF US AS A COUNTRY, FOR ME, A CALL TO ACTION. MY FATHER USED TO SAY AT SILENCE IS COMPLICITY, NOT ORIGINAL TO HIM, BUT HE BELIEVED IT. I KNEW I COULD NOT STAND BY AND LET DONALD TRUMP, A MAN WHO WENT ON TO SAY WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHAT HE THOUGHT HE SAID THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES, VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. YOU SEE HIM CONTINUE TO ATTACK EVERYTHING THAT MAKES AMERICA AMERICA. I KNEW WE WERE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. THAT IS WHY I DECIDED TO RUN. I AM PROUD NOW TO HAVE SENATOR HARRIS AT MY SIDE IN THAT BATTLE , BECAUSE SHE SHARES THE SAME INTENSITY I DO. SHE IS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT IS AT STAKE. THE QUESTION IS FOR ALL AMERICANS TO ANSWER, WHO ARE WE AS A NATION? WHAT DO WE STAND FOR? AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT DO WE WANT TO BE? YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THAT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY IS LIMITED ONLY BY THE BARRIERS WE PLACE ON OUR OWN IMAGINATIONS BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING AMERICANS CANNOT ACHIEVE WHEN WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT AND WE DO IT TOGETHER. ONE OF THE REASONS I CHOSE KAMALA AS WE BOTH BELIEVE WE CAN DIVIDE AMERICA SIMPLY IN ONE WORD, POSSIBILITIES. POSSIBILITIES. LET ME SAY IT AGAIN. POSSIBILITIES, THAT IS AMERICA. THAT IS WHAT SETS THIS NATION APART IS THAT EVERYONE, EVERYONE, THE ABILITY FOR EVERYONE, AND WE MEAN EVERYONE TO GO AS FAR A DREAM AS BIG AS HARD WORK AND THEIR GOD-GIVEN ABILITY WILL TAKE THEM. WHEN I AGREED TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RUNNING MATE, HE ASKED ME A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED KAMALA. THE MOST IMPORTANT TO ME, HE ASKED WHAT I WANTED, MOST IMPORTANTLY? I TOLD HIM I WANTED TO BE THE LAST PERSON IN THE ROOM BEFORE HE MADE IMPORTANT DECISIONS. THAT IS WHAT I ASKED KAMALA. I ASKED HER TO BE THE LAST VOICE OF THE ROOM, TO ALWAYS TELL ME THE TRUTH, AND SHE WILL. CHALLENGE MY ASSUMPTIONS IF SHE DISAGREES. ASK THE HARD QUESTIONS. THAT IS THE WAY WE MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I GOT A CHANCE TO SPEND SOME TIME AT MY HOME TODAY WITH KAMALA AND DOUG, AND I WANT TO THANK THEM AND THANK THEM PUBLICLY FOR AGREEING TO JOIN AND TAKE THIS JOURNEY WITH JILL AND ME. DOUG, YOU WILL HAVE TO LEARN WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A BARRIER BREAKER YOURSELF IN THIS JOB YOU ARE ABOUT TO TAKE ON. AMERICA'S FIRST SECOND GENTLEMAN , AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT HERE WITH US TODAY, I WANT TO THANK ELLEN AND COAL AS WELL. I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO DOUG'S MOM AND DAD, AND WE ARE GOING TO GET OUR KIDS TOGETHER TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT IS COMING. MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE ABOUT THE AGE OF THEIR CHILDREN. I GOT TO SPEAK TO THEM. MY CAMPAIGN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAMILY AFFAIR, EVERY CAMPAIGN I HAVE RUN, SO I HAVE GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU. YOU ARE ALL HONORARY BIDENS. HERE IS THE BEST PART. YOU HAVE BEEN AN HONORARY BIDENS FOR QUITE SOME TIME. I CAME FIRST TO KNOW WHO KAMALA THROUGH OUR SON BEAU BIDEN. THEY WERE FRIENDS. THEY SERVED AS ATTORNEYS GENERAL AT THE SAME TIME. THEY TOOK ON THE SAME BIG FIGHTS TOGETHER. KAMALA IN CALIFORNIA, BO IN DELAWARE. BIG FIGHTS THAT HELP CHANGE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. I KNOW HOW MUCH BEAU RESPECTED KAMALA AND HER WORK. THAT MEANT A LOT TO ME AS I MADE THIS DECISION. NOW WE NEED TO GET TO WORK PULLING THIS NATION OUT OF THESE CRISES WE FIND OURSELVES IN. ENDING OUR ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK, UNITING THIS NATION, AND WINNING THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME YOUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, KAMALA HARRIS . THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU, JOE. THANK YOU, JOE. AS I SAID WHEN YOU CALLED ME, I AM INCREDIBLY HONORED BY THIS RESPONSIBILITY AND I AM READY TO GET TO WORK. I AM READY TO GET TO WORK. AFTER THE MOST COMPETITIVE PRIMARY IN HISTORY, THE COUNTRY RECEIVED A RESOUNDING MESSAGE THAT JOE WAS THE PERSON TO LEAD US FORWARD, AND I AM SO PROUD TO STAND WITH YOU, AND I DO SO MINDFUL OF ALL OF THE HEROIC AND AMBITIOUS WOMEN BEFORE ME WHOSE SACRIFICE, DETERMINATION, AND RESILIENCE MAKES MY PRESENCE HERE TODAY EVEN POSSIBLE. THIS IS A MOMENT OF REAL CONSEQUENCE FOR AMERICA. EVERYTHING WE CARE ABOUT, OUR ECONOMY, OUR HEALTH, OUR CHILDREN, THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE LIVE IN, IT IS ALL ON THE LINE. WE ARE REALLY , REALLY , REELING FROM THE WORST PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN A CENTURY. AT THE PRESIDENT'S MISMANAGEMENT OF THE PANDEMIC HAS PLUNGED US INTO THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND WE ARE EXPERIENCING A MORAL RECKONING WITH RACISM AND SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE THAT HAS BROUGHT A NEW COALITION OF CONSCIENCE TO THE STREETS OF OUR COUNTRY DEMANDING CHANGE. AMERICA IS CRYING OUT FOR LEADERSHIP, YET WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO CARES MORE ABOUT HIMSELF THAN THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED HIM, A PRESIDENT WHO IS MAKING EVERY CHALLENGE WE FACE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO SOLVE, BUT HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS. WE DO NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FAILED GOVERNMENT OF DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE. IN JUST 83 DAYS, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO CHOOSE A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR COUNTRY. SO, JOE, DR. BIDEN, THANK YOU FOR THE TRUST YOU HAVE PLACED IN ME. JILL, I KNOW YOU WILL BE AN INCREDIBLE FIRST LADY, AND MY HUSBAND DOUG AND I ARE SO GRATEFUL, GRATEFUL TO BECOME A PART OF YOUR EXTENDED FAMILY. EVER SINCE I RECEIVED JO'S CALL, I HAVE BEEN THINKING, YES, ABOUT THE FIRST BIDEN I REALLY CAME TO KNOW, AND THAT OF COURSE IS JO'S BELOVED SON BEAU. IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT RECESSION, BEAU AND I SPOKE ON THE PHONE SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY WORKING TOGETHER TO WIN BACK BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR HOMEOWNERS FROM THE BIG BANKS OF THE NATION THAT WERE FORECLOSING ON PEOPLE'S HOMES, AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT BEAU BIDEN, I LEARNED QUICKLY THAT BEAU WAS THE KIND OF GUY WHO INSPIRED PEOPLE TO BE A BETTER VERSION OF THEMSELVES. HE REALLY WAS THE BEST OF US. WHEN I WOULD ASK HIM, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? HE WOULD ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HIS DAD. AND I WILL TELL YOU THE LOVE THAT THEY SHARED WAS INCREDIBLE TO WATCH. IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY OF THE LOVE BETWEEN A FATHER AND A SON. AND BEAU TALKED ABOUT HOW JOE WOULD SPEND EVERY DAY WRITING THE RAILS FROM WILMINGTON TO WASHINGTON, D.C. SO HE COULD MAKE BREAKFAST FOR HIS KIDS IN THE MORNING AND MAKE IT HOME IN TIME TO TUCK THEM IN BED EACH NIGHT. ALL OF THIS SO TWO LITTLE BOYS: I JUST LOST THEIR MOM AND SISTER IN A TRAGIC ACCIDENT WOULD KNOW THAT THE WORLD WAS STILL TURNING, AND THAT IS HOW I CAME TO KNOW JOE. HE IS SOMEONE WHOSE FIRST RESPONSE WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH IS NEVER TO THINK ABOUT HIMSELF, BUT TO CARE FOR EVERYONE ELSE. HE IS SOMEONE WHO NEVER ASKED, WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME, AND INSTEAD ASKS, WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR YOU? IS EMPATHY, HIS COMPUTER , HIS EMPATHY, AND HIS COMPASSION, AND HIS SENSE OF DUTY TO CARE FOR OTHERS IS WHY I AM SO PROUD TO BE ON THIS TICKET. JOE AND I, YES, WE ARE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH. I CANNOT WAIT FOR AMERICA TO GET TO KNOW MY HUSBAND DOUG AND OUR AMAZING KIDS, BECAUSE WHETHER I AM CHEERING IN THE BLEACHERS AT A SWIM MEET WERE SETTING UP A COLLEGE ROOM DOOR OR HELPING MY GODDAUGHTER PREPARE FOR MY SCHOOL , FOR HER SCHOOL DEBATE OR BUILDING LEGOS WITH MY GODSON OR HUGGING MY TWO BABY NIECES OR COOKING DINNER, SUNDAY DINNER, MY FAMILY MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME. I HAVE HAD A LOT OF TITLES OVER MY CAREER, AND CERTAINLY VICE PRESIDENT WILL BE GREAT, BUT MAMA WILL ALWAYS BE THE ONE THAT MEANS THE MOST. MY MOTHER AND FATHER, THEY CAME FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE WORLD TO ARRIVE IN AMERICA. ONE FROM INDIA, AND THE OTHER FROM JAMAICA IN SEARCH OF A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION, BUT WHAT BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER WAS THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT OF THE 1960'S, AND THAT IS HOW THEY MET, AS STUDENTS IN THE STREETS OF OAKLAND MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE AND A STRUGGLE THAT CONTINUES TODAY. I WAS PART OF IT. MY PARENTS WOULD BRING ME TO PROTESTS STRAPPED TIGHTLY IN MY STROLLER, AND MY MOTHER RAISED MY SISTER MAIA AND ME TO BELIEVE IT WAS UP TO US AND EVERY GENERATION OF AMERICANS TO KEEP ON MARCHING. SHE WOULD TELL US, DO NOT SIT AROUND AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THINGS, DO SOMETHING. SO I DID SOMETHING. I DEVOTED MY LIFE TO MAKING REAL THE WORDS CARVED IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. ADD 30 YEARS AGO, I STOOD BEFORE A JUDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREATHED DEEP AND UTTERED THE PHRASE THAT WOULD TRULY GUIDE MY CAREER AND THE REST OF MY CAREER, KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE, THAT IS WHO I HAVE REPRESENTED AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY FIGHTING ON BEHALF OF VICTIMS WHO NEEDED HELP, THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHO I VOTE FOR IS CALIFORNIA'S ATTORNEY GENERAL WHEN I TOOK ON TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAFFIC AND GUNS AND DRUGS AND HUMAN BEINGS. IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO LIFT HAVE FOUGHT FOR AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR, WHERE I HAVE WORKED EVERY DAY TO HOLD OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THE PEOPLE ARE WHO JOE AND I WILL FIGHT FOR EVERY DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. LET ME TELL YOU. AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS PRESENTED MY FAIR SHARE OF ARGUMENTS IN COURT, THE CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE IS OPEN AND SHUT. JUST LOOK AT THEY HAVE GOTTEN US. MORE THAN 16 MILLION OUT OF WORK , MILLIONS OF KIDS WHO CANNOT GO BACK TO SCHOOL, A CRISIS OF PROPERTY, HOMELESSNESS INFLICTING BLACK, BROWN AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF THE MOST. A CRISIS OF HUNGER INFLICTING ONE IN A FIVE MOTHERS WHO HAVE CHILDREN'S WHO ARE HUNGRY, AND TRAGICALLY, MORE THAN A 165,000 LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN CUT SHORT. MANY WITH LOVED ONES WHO NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE. IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. SIX YEARS AGO, WE HAD A DIFFERENT HEALTH CRISIS. IT WAS CALLED EBOLA, AND WE ALL REMEMBER THAT PANDEMIC. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THEN? BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN DID THEIR JOBS. ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES DIE, TWO. THAT IS WHAT IS CALLED LEADERSHIP. COMPARE THAT TO THE MOMENT WE FIND OURSELVES IN NOW, WHEN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE FOLLOWING THE SCIENCE, TRUMP PUSHED MIRACLE CURES TO SELL ON FOX NEWS. WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES WERE FLATTENING THE CURVES, HE SAID THE VIRUS WOULD JUST, PROOF , POOF, GO AWAY LIKE A MIRACLE. WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES OPEN BACK OF HER BUSINESS, WHAT DID WE DO? WE HAD TO SHUT DOWN AGAIN. THIS VIRUS HAS IMPACTED ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY, BUT THERE IS A REASON IT HAS HIT AMERICA WORSE THAN ANY OTHER ADVANCED NATION. IT IS BECAUSE OF TRUMPS , TRUMP'S FAILURE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY FROM THE START. HIS REFUSAL TO GET TESTING UP AND RUNNING, AND FLIP-FLOPPING ON SOCIAL DISTANCING AND WEARING MASKS. IT IS DELUSIONAL BELIEF THAT HE KNOWS BETTER THAN THE EXPERTS. ALL OF THAT IS REASON, THE RECENT THAT AN AMERICAN DIES OF COVID-19 EVERY 80 SECONDS. IT IS WHY COUNTLESS BUSINESSES HAVE HAD TO SHUT THEIR DOORS FOR GOOD. IT IS WHY THERE IS COMPLETE CHAOS OVER WHEN AND HOW TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS, MOTHERS AND FATHERS ARE CONFUSED AND UNCERTAIN AND ANGRY ABOUT CHILDCARE AND TO SAFETY OF THEIR KIDS AT SCHOOL, WHETHER THEY WILL BE IN DANGER IF THEY GO OR FALL BEHIND IF THEY DO NOT. TRUMP IS ALSO THE REASON IT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE NOW UNEMPLOYED. HE INHERITED THE LONGEST ECONOMIC EXPANSION IN HISTORY FROM BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN, AND THEN, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HE INHERITED, HE RAN IT STRAIGHT INTO THE GROUND. BECAUSE OF TRUMPS FAILURES , TRUMP'S FAILURES OF LEADERSHIP, OUR ECONOMY HAS TAKEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST HITS OUT OF ALL OF THE MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS WITH AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT HAS TRIPLED AS OF TODAY. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ELECT THE GUY WHO JUST IS NOT UP FOR THE JOB. OUR COUNTRY ENDS UP IN TATTERS, AND SO DOES OUR REPUTATION AROUND THE WORLD. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR. THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT DEFEATING DONALD TRUMP OR MIKE PENCE, IT IS ABOUT BUILDING THIS COUNTRY BACK BETTER. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT JOE AND I WILL DO. WE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH A CLEAN ENERGY RESOLUTION, BRING BRACK , BACK CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINS. BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO EVERYONE HAS THE PEACE OF MIND THAT COMES WITH HEALTH INSURANCE AND FINALLY OFFERED CAREGIVERS THE DIGNITY, THE RESPECT, AND THE PAY THEY DESERVE. WE WILL PROTECT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY, WROTE OUT SYSTEMIC , ROOT OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND PASS A JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ACT THAT WILL ENSURE EVERY VOICE IS HEARD AND EVERY VOICE IS COUNTED. THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE IS NOTHING NEW TO JOE. IT IS LIKE YOU GOT INTO PUBLIC SERVICE, WHY HE HELPED REAUTHORIZE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND RESTORE UNEMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAWS. HE TAKES HIS PLACE IN THE ONGOING STORY OF AMERICA'S MARCH TOWARD EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AS THE ONLY, AS THE ONLY WAY SERVED ALONGSIDE THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT AND HAS CHOSEN THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN AS HIS RUNNING MATE. BUT AS JOE ALWAYS POINTS OUT, THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT MORE THAN POLITICS. IT IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. I WILL ADMIT OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS WHERE I HAVE TRULY WORRIED ABOUT OUR FUTURE. WHENEVER I THINK THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR DOUBT, WHENEVER I HAVE HAD MY OWN DOUBTS, I THINK OF YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE DOCTORS AND NURSES AND FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO ARE RISKING YOUR LIVES TO SAVE OTHERS, THE TRUCK DRIVERS AND WORKERS IN GROCERY STORES, IN FACTORIES, FARMS WORKING THERE, PUTTING YOUR OWN SAFETY ON THE LINE TO UP US GET THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC, THE WOMEN AND STUDENTS TAKING TO THE STREETS IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS , THE DREAMERS AND IMMIGRANTS WHO KNOW THAT FAMILIES BELONG TOGETHER, THE LGBTQ AMERICANS WHO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS LOVE, PEOPLE OF EVERY AGE AND COLOR AND GREAT YOU FINALLY DECLARING IN ONE VOICE, BLACK LIVES MATTER . ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY , THIS COUNTRY, A NEW GENERATION OF CHILDREN IS HEARING UP , GROWING UP HEARING THE CRIES FOR JUSTICE AND CHANTS OF HOPE ON WHICH I WAS RAISED, SOME STRAPPED INTO STROLLERS OF THEIR OWN. IT IS A SONG YOU WILL NEVER FORGET. TO EVERYONE KEEPING UP THE FIGHT, YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING. YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING GREAT. YOU ARE THE HEROES OF OUR TIME, AND YOU ARE THE REASON. I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR COUNTRY CLOSER TO REALIZING IT'S GREAT PROMISE. TO DO IT, WE WILL NEED TO WORK, ORGANIZE AND VOTE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE NEED MORE THAN A VICTORY ON NOVEMBER 3. WE NEED A MANDATE THAT PROVES THE PAST FOUR YEARS ARE WHO WE ARE OR WHO WE ASPIRE TO BE. JOE LIKES TO SAY THAT CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT, AND IT IS TRUE. WHEN HE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE THREE YEARS AGO TODAY, Q KNEW WE WERE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. TOGETHER WITH YOUR HELP, IT IS A BATTLE WE WILL WIN. EARLIER THIS YEAR, I SAID I WOULD DO WHATEVER JOE ASKED ME TO DO. NOW I AM ASKING YOU TO DO THE SAME. VISIT JOB, JOEBIDEN.COM. ELECTING JOE BIDEN IS JUST THE START OF THE WORK AHEAD OF US. I COULD NOT BE PROUDER TO BE BUT DECIDED RUNNING TO REPRESENT YOU, THE PEOPLE. THANK YOU, AND MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

EASTERN. WATCH LIVE COVERAGE ON C-SPAN. WATCH LIVE STREAMING AND ON-DEMAND ON C-SPAN.ORG. EARLIER TODAY, JOE BIDEN DELIVERED REMARKS ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT DURING A CAMPAIGN STOP IN PITTSBURGH. HE CONDEMNED THE RIOTING AND LOOTING TAKING PLACE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND BLAMED PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THE INCREASE IN VIOLENCE. THIS IS 25 MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON. I WANT TO THINK CARNEGIE MELLON FOR PROVIDING THIS SPACE AND ALL THE PROMISE IT HOLDS FOR FUTURE JOBS AND , IN THE HIGH-TECH WORLD. IN RECENT DAYS, WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW I HAVE DECIDED TO COME TO PITTSBORO TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF WORLD WAR II, FOR THEM ROOSEVELT TOLD THE COUNTRY THE NEWS IS GOING TO GET WORSE AND WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER AND BETTER. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO HAVE IT STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER. STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER. THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT IS TO TELL IT STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER, TELL THE TRUTH. TO BE CANDID, TO FACE FACTS, TO LEAD, NOT TO INCITE. THAT IS WHY I AM SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY. THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT IS INCAPABLE OF TELLING US THE TRUTH, INCAPABLE OF FACING THE FACTS AND INCAPABLE OF HEALING. HE DOES NOT WANT TO SHED LIGHT, HE WANTS TO GENERATE HEAT. HE IS STOKING VIOLENCE IN OUR CITIES. THIS IS A TRAGIC FACT OF THE MATTER ABOUT HIS PERILOUS OUR. , ABOUT THIS PERILOUS HOUR. WE HAVE SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN, UNWARRANTED POLICE SHOOTING, EXCESSIVE FORCE. SEVEN BULLETS TO THE BACK OF JACOB BLAKE. VIOLENCE OF EXTREMISTS AND OPPORTUNISTS, RIGHT-WING MILITIAS, WHITE SUPREMACISTS, VIGILANTES, WHO INFILTRATE PROTEST. HOPING TO WREAK HAVOC AND TO DERAIL ANY HOPE OF PROGRESS. I WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR, LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT ALL THIS. WRITING IS NOT PROTESTING , RIOTING IS NOT PROTESTING, SETTING FIRES IS NOT PROTESTING. NONE OF THIS IS PROTESTING. IT IS LAWLESSNESS, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. THOSE WHO DO IT SHOULD BE PROSECUTED. VIOLENCE WILL NOT BRING CHANGE. IT WILL ONLY BRING DESTRUCTION. IT IS WRONG IN EVERY WAY. IT DIVIDES INSTEAD OF UNITES. THIS ONLY HURTS THE WORKING FAMILIES THAT SERVE THE COMMUNITY. IT MAKES THINGS WORSE ACROSS THE BOARD, NOT BETTER. IT IS NOT WHAT DR. KING OR JOHN LEWIS TAUGHT. IT MUST END. FIRES ARE BURNING AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO FANS THE FLAMES RATHER THAN FIGHTING THE FLAMES. WE MUST NOT BURN, WE HAVE TO BUILD. THIS PRESIDENT LONG AGO FORFEITED ANY MORAL LEADERSHIP. HE CANNOT STOP THE VIOLENCE BECAUSE FOR YEARS HE HAS FOMENTED IT. HE MAY BELIEVE THAT MOUTHING THE WORDS LAW AND ORDER MAKES HIM STRONG. BUT HIS FAILURE TO CALL ON HIS OWN SUPPORTERS TO STOP ACTING AS AN ARMED MILITIA IN THIS COUNTRY SHOWS HOW WEAK HE IS. DOES ANYONE BELIEVE THERE WILL BE LESS VIOLENCE IN AMERICA IF DONALD TRUMP IS REELECTED? WE NEED JUSTICE IN AMERICA. WE NEED SAFETY IN AMERICA. WE ARE FACING CRISES THAT KEPT MULTIPLYING. COVID, ECONOMIC DEMONSTRATION, UNWARRANTED POLICE VIOLENCE. IN BOLDING , EMBOLDENING WHITE NATIONALISTS. THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T JUST DO SO MUCH MORE THAT WE ARE DOING , THEN WE ARE DOING. THE COMMON THREAD IS THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT WHO MAKES THINGS WORSE, NOT BETTER. THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT WHO SOWS CHAOS RATHER THAN PROVIDING ORDER. AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT WHO FAILS IN THE BASIC DUTY OF THE JOB. THAT IS TO ADVANCE THE TRUTH THAT ALL OF US KNOW. WE ARE ALL BORN WITH THE RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THAT IS RIGHT, ALL OF US. THE MOMS AND DADS IN SCRANTON WHERE I GREW UP WHO HAVE WORKED AND SCRIPT FOR EVERYTHING THEY HAVE EVER GOTTEN IN LIFE. THE AUTOWORKER IN MICHIGAN WHO MAKES , WHO STOMACHS THE BEST IN THE WORLD. THE SINGLE MOM IN OHIO MAKING , A SINGLE MOM IN OHIO WORKING THREE JOBS TO STAY AFLOAT WHO WILL DO ANYTHING FOR HER CHILD, RETIRED VETERAN IN FLORIDA WHO GAVE EVERYTHING HE HAD TO THIS COUNTRY AND NOW JUST WANTS US TO HONOR THE PROMISES MADE TO HIM. THE LORD & TAYLOR SALESPERSON WHO JUST LOST THEIR JOB, A STORE CLOSING AFTER 194 YEARS. NURSES AND DOCTORS IN WISCONSIN WHO HAVE SEEN SO MUCH SICKNESS AND DEATH, AND THEY WONDER HOW MUCH MORE CAN THEY TAKE, BUT STILL THEY MUSTER UP THE COURAGE TO TAKE THEIR OF THOSE IN THIS , TAKE CARE OF THOSE PATIENTS IN THIS PANDEMIC WHILE RISKING THEIR OWN LIVES. RESEARCHERS IN MINNESOTA WHO WOKE UP THIS MORNING DETERMINED TO FIND A BREAKTHROUGH IN TREATING CANCER. THEY WILL DO THE SAME THING TOMORROW AND THE DAY AFTER AND THE DAY AFTER BECAUSE SHE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. WHITE, BLACK, LATINO, ASIAN AMERICAN, NATIVE AMERICANS, EVERYBODY. I AM IN THIS CAMPAIGN FOR YOU, NO MATTER YOUR COLOR, ZIP CODE, POLITICS. WHEN I THINK OF THE PRESIDENCY, I DON'T THINK ABOUT MYSELF, IT IS NOT ABOUT MY BRAND, IT IS ABOUT YOU. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE CAN DO BETTER, WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. I PROMISE YOU THAT WE WILL DO BETTER. THE ROAD BACK BEGINS NOW IN THIS CAMPAIGN. YOU KNOW ME. YOU KNOW MY HEART. YOU KNOW MY STORY, MY FAMILY STORY. ASK YOURSELF IF I LOOK LIKE A RADICAL SOCIALIST WITH A SOFT SPOT FOR RIOTERS? REALLY? I WANT TO SAVE AMERICA, SAY FROM COVID, SAFE FROM CRIME AND LOOTING. SAFE FROM RACIALLY MOTIVATED VIOLENCE, SAFE FROM BAD COPS. LET ME BE CRYSTAL CLEAR. SAFE FROM FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. I LOOK AT THIS VIOLENCE AND I SEE LIVES AND COMMUNITIES AND THE DREAMS OF SMALL BUSINESSES BEING DESTROYED. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REAL PROGRESS IN THE ISSUES OF RACE AND POLICE REFORM, JUSTICE BEING PUT TO THE TEST. DONALD TRUMP LOOKS AT THIS VIOLENCE AND SEES A POLITICAL LIFELINE. HAVING FAILED TO PROTECT THIS NATION FROM THE VIRUS, IT HAS KILLED MORE THAN 180,000 AMERICANS SO FAR. TRUMP POSTED IN ALL CAPS , AN ALL CAPS TWEET TO SAVE HIS CAMPAIGN. SHE COMES OUT AS HAS A, THE MORE CHAOS, VIOLENCE, THE BETTER IT IS FOR TRUMP'S REELECTION. JUST THINK ABOUT THAT. THIS IS A SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING THIS COUNTRY BUT INSTEAD, HE IS ROOTING FOR CHAOS AND VIOLENCE. THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS DONALD TRUMP FAILED TO PROTECT AMERICA. SINCE THEY CAN'T RUN ON THE RECORD, WE WILL SEE MORE AMERICAN DEATH TO A VIRUS, THIS VIRUS THAN THE NATION HAS SUFFERED IN EVERY WAR SINCE KOREA COMBINED. SINCE THEY CAN'T RUN ON THEIR ECONOMY, THAT HAS SEEN MORE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS THAN ANY TIME SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. SINCE THEY CAN'T RUN ON THE SIMPLE PROPOSITION OF SENDING OUR CHILDREN SAFELY BACK TO SCHOOL. SINCE THEY HAVE NO AGENDA OR VISION FOR A SECOND TERM. TRUMP AND PENTZ ARE RUNNING ON THIS, I FIND IT FASCINATING. IT WON'T BE SAFE IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA. WHAT IS THERE PROOF? THE VIOLENCE WE ARE SEEING IN DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA. THESE ARE NOT IMAGES OF SOME IMAGINED JOE BIDEN AMERICA OF THE FUTURE, THESE ARE IMAGES OF DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA TODAY. HE KEEPS SAYING IF HE WAS PRESIDENT THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN, YOU WOULD FEEL SAFE. WILL HE IS PRESIDENT WHETHER HE KNOWS IT OR NOT. IT IS HAPPENING. IT IS GETTING WORSE. YOU KNOW WHY. DONALD TRUMP ADDS FUEL TO EVERY FIRE. HE REFUSES TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A RACIAL JUSTICE PROBLEM IN AMERICA. HE WON'T STAND UP TO ANY FORM OF VIOLENCE. HE HAS NO PROBLEM WITH RIGHT WING MILITIAS. OFTEN BETTER ARMED THAN THE POLICE, OFTEN IN THE MIDDLE OF VIOLENCE. AND BECAUSE TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS DON'T TRUST THIS PRESIDENT TO RESPECT THEIR RIGHTS, TO HEAR THEIR CONCERNS OR TO PROTECT THEM. IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE HAD TO DEFEND FEDERAL PROPERTY. WE DID IT, WE DID NOT SEE IT , YOU DID NOT CS WHIPPING UP FEARS AROUND THE DEPLOYMENT OF SECRET FEDERAL TRUCE. , TROOPS. WE JUST DID OUR JOB. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WERE IN OFFICE, WE DID NOT LOOK AT CITIES AS DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN RUN, THESE ARE AMERICAN CITIES. TRUMP DOES NOT SEE HIMSELF AS PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS. FRANKLY, I BELIEVE IF I WERE PRESIDENT TODAY, THE COUNTRY WOULD BE SAFER AND WE WOULD BE SEEING A LOT LESS VIOLENCE. HERE IS WHY. I SAID WE MUST ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF RACIAL INJUSTICE. I PERSONALLY SPOKE TO GEORGE FLOYD'S FAMILY AND JACOB BLAKE'S FAMILY. I KNOW THEIR PAIN AND SO DO YOU. I KNOW THE JUSTICE THEY SEEK AND SO DO YOU. THEY TOLD US NONE OF THIS VIOLENCE RESPECTS OR HONORS GEORGE OR JACOB. I BELIEVE WE CAN BRING THESE PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR RACIAL INJUSTICE TO THE TABLE. I WORKED WITH POLICE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR MANY YEARS. I KNOW THAT MOST COPS ARE GOOD, DECENT PEOPLE. I KNOW HOW THEY RISK THEIR LIVES EVERY TIME THEY PUT THAT SHIELD ON AND LOCK THE DOOR. I AM CONFIDENT THAT I CAN BRING THE POLICE TO THE TABLE AS WELL. I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT EVERY MAYOR AND GOVERNOR HAD THE SUPPORT THEY NEEDED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT, I WOULD NOT BE LOOKING TO USE THE UNITED STATES MILITARY AGAINST THEIR OWN PEOPLE. IF I WERE PRESIDENT, MY LANGUAGE WOULD BE LESS DIVISIVE. I WOULD BE LOOKING TO LOWER THE TEMPERATURE IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT RAISE IT. I WOULD BE LOOKING TO UNITE THE NATION. BUT LOOK, IF DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO ASK THE QUESTION OF WHO WILL KEEP YOU SAFE OR AS PRESIDENT? BUT AFTER THAT QUESTION. FIRST, SOME SIMPLE FACTS. WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT, FILED , VIOLENT CRIME FELL 15% IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY DID IT WITHOUT CHAOS , WE DID IT WITHOUT CHAOS AND WITHOUT DISORDER ORDER. AND YES, WE DID IT WITH DEMOCRATIC MAYORS AND MOST OF THE CDS , MAJOR CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY. THE MURDER RATE IS UP UNDER DONALD TRUMP. YOU REALLY FEEL SAFER UNDER DONALD TRUMP? COVID HAS TAKEN THIS YEAR , IT HAS TAKEN MORE THAN , MORE LIES THIS YEAR THAN ANY OTHER YEAR FOR THE LAST 100 YEARS. MORE THAN 180,000 LIES IN JUST SIX MONTHS. AN AVERAGE OF A THOUSAND PEOPLE DYING PER WEEK IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT FEAR, DINO IT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF IN AMERICA? THEY ARE AFRAID THEY ARE GOING TO GET COVID. THEY ARE AFRAID THEY ARE GOING TO GET SICK AND DIE. THAT IS IN NO SMALL PART BECAUSE OF YOU. WE ARE NOW ON TRACK FOR MORE THAN 200,000 DEATHS IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF COVID. MORE THAN 100,000 SENIORS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE VIRUS. MORE COPS HAVE DIED FROM COVID THIS YEAR THAN HAVE BEEN KILLED ON PATROL. NEARLY ONE IN SIX SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSED IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY. DO YOU REALLY FEEL SAFER UNDER TRUMP? WHAT ABOUT TRUMP'S PLAN TO DESTROY THE FEDERAL CARE ACT? PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, IT IMPACTS MORE THAN 100 MILLION AMERICANS. DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SAFER? HOW ABOUT TRUMP'S PLAN TO DEFUND SOCIAL SECURITY? SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S CHIEF ACTUARY JUST RELIEF , RELEASED A REPORT SAYING IF TRUMP'S PLAN GOES INTO EFFECT, THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FORM WOULD BE \"PERMANENTLY DEPLETED BY THE MIDDLE OF CALENDAR YEAR 2023, WITH NO ABILITY TO PAY BENEFITS THEREAFTER.\" TO PUT IT PLAINLY, TRUMPS PLAN WOULD WIPE OUT SOCIAL SECURITY, PERIOD. DO YOU FEEL SAFER AND MORE SECURE NOW? THE FEAR THAT REIGNS UNDER THIS PRESIDENT DOES NOT STOP AT OUR SHORES. THE KREMLIN HAS PUT BOUNTIES ON THE HEADS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS. INSTEAD OF TELLING VLADIMIR PUTIN THAT THERE WILL BE NO PUTTING UP WITH THIS, THAT THERE WILL BE A HEAVY PRICE TO PLAY IF HE TOUCHES AN AMERICAN SOLDIER, THIS PRESIDENT DOES I EVEN BRING UP THE SUBJECT IN HIS MOBILE PHONE CALL WITH PUTIN. A REPORT THAT THE RUSSIAN FORCES JUST ATTACKED AMERICAN FORCES IN SYRIA, INJURING OUR SERVICEMEMBERS. DID YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY A SINGLE WORD? DID HE LIFT ONE FINGER NEVER BEFORE HAS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT PAID SUCH A SUBSERVIENT ROLE TO RUSSIAN LEADERS. IT'S NOT ONLY DANGEROUS, IT'S HUMILIATING AND EMBARRASSING FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD TO SEE IT WEAKENS US. NOT EVEN AMERICAN TROOPS CAN FEEL SAFER UNDER TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP'S ROLE AS A BYSTANDER IN HIS OWN PRESIDENCY EXTENDS THE ECONOMIC PLAN AND PAIN. THE PLANNING DOESN'T HAVE IN THE PAIN BEING FELT BY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. HE SAID THIS WEEK, \"YOU BETTER VOTE FOR ME OR YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THE GREATEST DEPRESSION YOU HAVE EVER SEEN.\" DOES HE NOT UNDERSTAND AND SEE THAT TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO LOVE HAD TO FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT THIS YEAR SO FAR? THAT PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE NEXT MONTH'S RENT PAYMENT. THE PEOPLE WHO LOST WAGES OVER COST OF GROCERIES GOING UP DRAMATICALLY. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I STOPPED THE DEPRESSION IN 2009. WE TOOK A BAD ECONOMY THAT WAS FALLING AND TURNED IT AROUND. TRUMP TOOK A GOOD ECONOMY AND DROVE IT BACK INTO THE DITCH. THROUGH HIS FAILURE TO GET COVID UNDER CONTROL, HIS FAILURE TO PULL TOGETHER THE LEADERS IN CONGRESS, HIS FAILURE TO DELIVER REAL RELIEF TO WORKING PEOPLE HAS MADE OUR COUNTRY ECONOMIC SITUATION SO MUCH WORSE, SO MUCH WORSE THAN IT HAD TO BE. WE TALK ABOUT SAFETY AND SECURITY, WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE SIX SECURITY AND BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK. DON'T WORRY, WE WILL NOT LOSE OUR HOME. WE WILL PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. IT'S GOING TO BE OK. THAT'S THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT. I'VE LAID OUT AN AGENDA FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT WILL RESTORE SOCIAL SECURITY FOR WORKING FAMILIES. WE WON'T JUST BUILDINGS BACK THE WAY THEY WERE BEFORE, WE WILL BUILD THEM BACK THAT HER. WITH GOOD PAYING DROPS , JOBS. WITH INVESTMENTS IN OUR HEALTH CARE AND CHILD CARE WORKERS SO THEY GET THE PAY IN DIGNITY THEY DESERVE. WHILE USING A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON MILLIONS OF FAMILIES. WITH THE CLEAN ENERGY STRATEGY THAT HAS A PLACE FOR THE ENERGY WORKERS RIGHT HERE IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. I AM NOT BANNING FRACTION , FRACKING. I AM NOT BANNING FRACKING NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES DONALD TRUMP WISE ABOUT ME , LIES ABOUT ME. THE FUTURE IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. WE HEAR DONALD TRUMP SELF-CENTERED RANT AND RISKS. THE VOICE OF AMERICANS SHOULD BE HEARD. THE ONE YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO HIS JULIA JACKSON, THE MOTHER OF JACOB BLAKE. THE VOICE OF COURAGE, CHARACTER AND WISDOM. LOOKING AT THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN HER CITY, SHE SAID \"THE VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION DOES NOT REFLECT THE SUN OR MY FAMILY. THESE OTHER WORDS OF A MOM, A MOTHER WHOSE SON HAD JUST BEEN SHOT SEVEN TIMES IN FRONT OF HIS CHILDREN. BADLY WOMEN PARALYZED, PERHAPS PERMANENTLY. EVEN , BADLY WOUNDED, PARALYZED, PERHAPS PERMANENTLY. SHE IS PLEADING FOR THIS NATION TO HEAL. SHE SAID SHE WAS PRAYING FOR HER SON. THEN SHE SAID SOMETHING TO ME THAT SURPRISED ME. SHE SAID SHE WAS PRAYING FOR ALL POLICE OFFICERS. SHE HAS ALREADY BEEN PLAYING , PRAYING FOR AMERICA EVEN BEFORE HER SON WAS SHOT. SHE HAS PUBLICLY ASKED ALL OF US TO EXAMINE OUR HEARTS. CITIZENS, ELECTED OFFICIALS, POLICE, ALL OF US. THEN SHE SAID THIS, \"WE NEED HEALING.\" MORE THAN ANYTHING. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS A NATION. WE NEED TO HEAL. THE CURRENT PRESIDENT WANTS YOU TO LIVE IN FEAR. HE ADVERTISES HIMSELF AS A FIGURE OF ORDER. HE ISN'T. HE HAS NOT BEEN PART OF THE SOLUTION THUS FAR. HE IS PART OF THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM THAT I WILL BE YOU MY ALL RESOLVED TO STOP. I WILL DEAL WITH THE VIRUS. I WILL DEAL WITH THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. ITHE PROBLEM THAT I WILL WORK TO BRING EQUALITY AND OPPORTUNITY TO EVERYONE. WE'VE ARRIVED AT A MOMENT IN THIS CAMPAIGN WHERE WE ALL KNOW, EVEN THE PRESS WILL WORK TO BRING EQUALITY AND IN FRONT OF ME, KNEW WE WOULD GET TO. THE MOMENT WHEN DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE SO DESPERATE HE WOULD DO ANYTHING TO HOLD ONTO POWER. DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A TOXIC PRESENCE IN OUR NATION FOR FOUR YEARS. POISONING HOW WE TALK TO ONE ANOTHER. POISONING HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER. POISONING THE VALUES THIS NATION HAS ALWAYS HELD DEAR. POISONING OUR VERY DEMOCRACY. NOW, IN JUST A LITTLE OVER 60 DAYS, WE HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE. WILL WE RID OURSELVES OF THIS TOXIN? OR WILL WE MAKE A PERMANENT PART , MAKE IT A PERMANENT PART OF OUR NATION'S CHARACTER? AS AMERICANS, I AM CONFIDENT WE BELIEVE IN HONESTY AND DECENCY. TREATING EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. GIVING EVERYONE A FAIR SHOT. LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND. GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR, AND DEMONIZING NO ONE. WE ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THERE IS SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. TRUMP DOES NOT SEEM TO BELIEVE IN ANY OF THAT. AMERICA IS AN IDEA. IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL IDEA IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. I BELIEVE IT SPEAKS TO THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. IN THE DIRT , AND THEY DESERVE TO BE TREATED EQUALLY. TRUMP HAS SOUGHT TO REMAKE THIS NATION IN HIS IMAGE, SELFISH, ANGRY, DARK AND DIVISIVE. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. AT OUR BEST, AMERICA'S ALWAYS BEEN, AND IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT, IT WILL BE AGAIN GENEROUS, AND OPTIMISTIC NATION FULL OF HOPE AND RESOLVE. DONALD TRUMP IS DETERMINED TO INSTILL FEAR IN AMERICA. THAT'S WHAT HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN COMES DOWN TO. FEAR. I BELIEVE AMERICA IS STRONGER THAN THAT. I BELIEVE WE WILL BE GUIDED BY THE WORDS OF POPE JOHN PAUL II. WORDS DRAWN FROM SCRIPTURE. BE NOT AFRAID. BE NOT AFRAID. FEAR NEVER BUILDS THE FUTURE, BUT HOPE DOES. AND BUILDING THE FUTURE IS WHAT AMERICA DOES, WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE. IT'S WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE BEST AND CONTINUE TO DO BEST. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY WHEN WE DECIDE TO DO IT TOGETHER. SO LET'S GET TOGETHER. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. MAY GOD BLESS YOU. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?475311-1\/joe-biden-delivers-remarks-public-safety-law-enforcement","Summary":"2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered remarks on public safety and law enforcement during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

{"SpeechID":"CSPANJB29202084","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-09-02","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden Remarks on Reopening Schools During COVID-19","RawText":"EARLIER TODAY, JOE BIDEN SPOKE ABOUT REOPENING SCHOOLS AMID THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. HE WAS JOINED BY HIS WIFE, JILL, A FORMER TEACHER. THIS TOOK PLACE IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, AND RUNS 40 MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON, FOLKS. WELCOME TO THE QUEEN THEATER. I AM HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT A CRISIS. A CRISIS BEING FELT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND JILL AND I HAVE JUST BEEN BRIEFED, AS YOU KNOW, IN THIS ROOM BY OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND EDUCATION EXPERTS ABOUT WHAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE TO BE ABLE TO REOPEN SCHOOLS SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. BACK-TO-SCHOOL HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SPECIAL TIME. IT IS IN YOUR FAMILY AND MINE, BUT PARTICULARLY IN MINE, ALL THE YEARS JILL AND I WERE MARRIED, SHE WAS GOING BACK TO SCHOOL, TOO, AS A TEACHER. SHE WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE TO TELL YOU THIS SHOULD BE A SEASON OF PROMISE FOR OUR COUNTRY. TIMES WHEN CLASSROOMS ARE CRACKLING WITH THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE NEW YEAR, STUDENTS' HOPES, ALL ABOUT THE FUTURE. BUT THIS YEAR, WE ARE FACING THE MOST DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF HEART AND GRIT FROM OUR EDUCATORS, OUR STUDENTS, TO TRY TO RISE TO THE OCCASION. BUT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS NOT COME UP TO THAT BAR. HASN'T SHOWN MUCH GRIT OR DETERMINATION. TO BE CLEAR, IF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD DONE THEIR JOBS EARLY ON WITH THIS CRISIS, AMERICAN SCHOOLS WOULD BE OPEN AND OPEN SAFELY. INSTEAD, AMERICAN FAMILIES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR HIS FAILURES AND HIS ADMINISTRATION'S FAILURES. LIKE MANY OF YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE REPORTERS, YOU HAVE FRIENDS, CHILDREN, YOU'RE PROBABLY HEARING THE SAME THING I HAVE BEEN HEARING. THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THEY ARE WORRIED. THEY ARE WORRIED LIKE THE DEVIL. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR MY KIDS? IS THIS SETTING MY CHILD'S EDUCATION BACK BEYOND JUST A SEMESTER? WHAT IMPACT WILL IT HAVE? HOW IS MY CHILD GOING TO CATCH UP? WHAT IF I AM NOT DOING ENOUGH TO HELP MY CHILD SUCCEED? ALL THOSE QUESTIONS, THE SELF-DOUBT HAS BEEN ENGAGED. PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY NOT THINK THIS IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. BUT I THINK GOING BACK TO SCHOOL, FOR MILLIONS OF CHILDREN AND THE IMPACTS ON FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY, IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. I BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT IT IS. PROTECTING OUR STUDENTS, OUR EDUCATORS, COMMUNITIES, GETTING OUR SCHOOLS OPEN SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY, THIS IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP STILL DOES NOT HAVE ANY REAL PLAN FOR HOW TO OPEN OUR SCHOOLS SAFELY. NO REAL PLAN FOR HOW TO HELP PARENTS FEEL SECURE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. HE IS OFFERING NOTHING BUT FAILURE AND DELUSIONS, START TO FINISH, AMERICAN FAMILIES AND CHILDREN ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR HIS FAILURES. FAILURE TO TAKE THIS VIRUS SERIOUSLY EARLY ON IN JANUARY, FEBRUARY, AS IT SPREAD AROUND THE GLOBE. FAILURE TO TAKE STEPS WE NEEDED IN MARCH AND APRIL TO GET THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL, TO INSTITUTE WIDESPREAD TESTING AND TRACING TO CONTROL THE SPREAD. FAILURE TO PROVIDE CLEAR, NATIONAL, SCIENCE-BASED GUIDELINES TO STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. AND FAILURE TO MODEL EVEN BASIC RESPONSIBILITY LIKE SOCIALLY DISTANCING AND WEARING A MASK. AND FAILURE TO MAKE SURE EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTRATORS HAVE THE EQUIPMENT, RESOURCES, AND TRAINING NEEDED TO OPEN SAFELY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WE FIND NOW. DONALD TRUMP AND BETSY DEVOS HAVE NOT STEPPED UP. WE ARE ALL CASEEING THE RESULTS. MILLIONS OF STUDENTS ARE STARTING A NEW SCHOOL YEAR IN THE SAME WAY THEY FINISHED THE LAST ONE, AT HOME. AT HOME. PARENTS ARE DOING THEIR BEST, BUT MORE AND MORE ARE FINDING THEMSELVES AT WIT'S END, STRUGGLING TO BALANCE WORK, CHILDCARE, AND EDUCATION DUTIES. OR WORRYING ABOUT THEIR LOSS PAYCHECK AND HOW THEY WILL MAKE ENDS MEET WHILE TRYING TO KEEP THEIR KIDS ON TRACK WITH REMOTE LEARNING. EDUCATORS ARE TAKING ON COUNTLESS HOURS OF ADDITIONAL TRAINING TO LEARN HOW TO USE REMOTE LEARNING TOOLS SO THEY CAN STILL BE THERE FOR THEIR STUDENTS, BUT THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT ALL THE KIDS WHO USED TO COUNT ON OUR SCHOOLS. ALL THOSE CHILDREN WHO NEEDED SO BADLY, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO NEED MORE THAN EDUCATION. THEY PROVIDE MEALS AND SAFE PLACES TO SPEND THE DAY. YOU NOW, WE ARE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE COVID-19 DOESN'T FURTHER EXACERBATE DISPARITIES, THE DISPARITIES THAT ALREADY HAVE EXISTED IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. FOR SO MANY POOR CHILDREN, SO MANY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE. AND IT CANNOT GO ON LIKE THIS. WE ALL WANT OUR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN SAFELY. WITH A PLAN THAT PRIORITIZES HEALTH OF STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS AND STAFF. I LAID OUT MY PLANS BACK IN JUNE AND JULY, A ROADMAP FOR HOW TO REOPEN SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. YOU CAN READ THEM BY GOING TO JOEBIDEN.COM. WE NEED STRAIGHTFORWARD, COMMON-SENSE SOLUTIONS. BUT TRUMP REFUSES TO ACT, STARVING SCHOOLS OF THE NEEDED FUNDING, FUNDING THEY NEED NOW. NOW! THEY NEEDED IT BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER. NOW TRUMP'S FEMA DIRECTOR IS CUTTING SCHOOLS LOOSE. JUST YESTERDAY FENA ANNOUNCED, AFTER HELPING THREE DISTRICTS , I THINK IT WAS THREE , THEY WILL NOT HELP PAY FOR CLOTH MASKS, PPE FOR SCHOOL SETTINGS, CLEANING. THOSE BASIC HEALTH NEEDS. SANITIZING EVERYTHING FROM LABORATORIES TO CLASSROOMS. AND SAFETY COSTS FOR SCHOOL THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY, MR. PRESIDENT. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. AND DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FEMA SHOULD TREAT IT AS ONE. IF I WERE PRESIDENT TODAY, I WOULD DIRECT FEMA TO MAKE SURE OUR KIDS K-12 GET FULL ACCESS TO DISASTER RELIEF AND EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE UNDER THE STAFFORD ACT. I WOULD MAKE SURE PPE AND SANITATION SUPPLIES QUALIFY AS EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE MEASURES, WHICH IS A PHRASE THEY USE, TO FULLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. ON TOP OF THAT, I WOULD BE WORKING WITH THE LEADERS OF CONGRESS NOW, TODAY, TO PASS EMERGENCY PACKAGES FOR SCHOOLS SO THEY WOULD HAVE RESOURCES THEY NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO OPEN SAFELY. MONEY FOR VENTILATION. I HEARD THAT A LOT WHEN I HAVE THOSE HEALTH-CARE EXPERTS UP ON THE ZOOM. MONEY FOR VENTILATION AND OTHER HEALTH MEASURES, BUT ALSO MORE MONEY TO HIRE MORE TEACHERS. EVERY RECOMMENDATION WE GOT WAS THEY SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO PODS, SMALLER CLASSES. SMALLER CLASSES MEAN MORE EDUCATORS ARE NEEDED. KEEPING CLASSES SOCIALLY DISTANCED, SMALL. MONEY FOR MORE PSYCHOLOGISTS AND COUNSELORS. I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION A LONG TIME AGO CALLING FOR , I PROPOSED LEGISLATION A LONG TIME AGO , WE HAVE ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST EVERY 1507 CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL. AND THE HEALTH CARE, THE MENTAL HEALTH OUR CHILDREN NEED NOW. THE ANXIETY THEY ARE FEELING AT HOME, GOING TO SCHOOL, NOT BEING ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL. THE NATION'S SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS HAVE ESTIMATED THEY NEED AT LEAST $200 BILLION TO SUPPORT K-12 SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR FOR SAFE REOPENING. WE NEED THE MONEY TO HIRE EDUCATORS AS WELL FOR OUR FOUR-YEAR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, COMMUNITY COLLEGES, HBCU'S, MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS. DEMOCRATIC LEADERS ARE READY TO GET THIS DONE. THEY HAVE ALREADY PROPOSED LEGISLATION. MR. PRESIDENT, WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU? WHY AREN'T YOU WORKING ON THIS? WE NEED EMERGENCY SUPPORT SUPPORT FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS AND WE NEED IT NOW. MR. PRESIDENT, THAT IS YOUR JOB. THAT IS YOUR JOB. THAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON NOW. GETTING OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL SAFELY, KEEPING SCHOOLS SAFELY ABLE TO REMAIN OPEN ONCE THEY OPEN. NOT WHIPPING UP FEAR AND DIVISION, NOT INCITING VIOLENCE IN OUR STREETS. GET OFF TWITTER, AND START TALKING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS FROM BOTH PARTIES. INVITE THEM TO THE OVAL OFFICE. THE OVAL OFFICE. AND STOP YOUR BOAST ABOUT BEING NOT , THAT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE. NEGOTIATE A DEAL. A DEAL FOR SOMEBODY OTHER THAN YOURSELF. NOW I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. I GUESS STAFF IS GOING TO CALL ON WHOEVER, FIRE AWAY. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. TWO QUICK QUESTIONS FOR YOU IF I MAY. AHEAD OF YOUR TRIP TO KENOSHA, WISCONSIN, YOUR RUNNING MATE SAID THE OFFICER WHO SHOT JACOB BLAKE BASED ON WHAT HE HAS SEEN SHOULD BE CHARGED AND DO YOU BELIEVE AND YOU FEEL THAT THE SAME SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE DEATH OF BREONNA TAYLOR? I THINK THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM SHOULD WORK ITS WAY. AND THE OFFICERS SHOULD BE CHARGED AS WELL AS IN BREONNA TAYLOR. I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN PORTLAND WHERE ONE OF THE TRUMP GUYS RIDING ALONG IN VANS AND SHOOTING RUBBER BULLETS OR PAINT BALLS AND SOMEONE WAS SHOT BY SOMEONE IN THE CROWD WITH A BULLET, KILLED. I THINK THAT PERSON SHOULD MEET THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT SHOULD BE FOLLOWED THROUGH WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. LET'S MAKE SURE JUSTICE IS DONE. QUICKLY ON A DIFFERENT TOPIC THERE IS A NEW BOOK BY \"NEW YORK TIMES\" THAT SAID WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE A VISIT TO WALTER REED, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE WAS TOLD TO BE ON STAND BY IN CASE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD TO RECEIVE ANESTHESIA AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE. AS VICE PRESIDENT WERE YOU TOLD TO BE ON STAND BY OR ANY KIND OF SPECIAL ALERT WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS GOING IN FOR A MEDICAL APPOINTMENT AND ANY CONCERNS THAT IT DIDN'T FOLLOW PRIOR PROTOCOL? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: I'M NOT GOING TO SPECULATE. NOTHING THIS ADMINISTRATION DOES IS NORMAL. I'M NOT BEING FASEACHOUS. WHO IN GOD'S NAME KNOWS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW KNOW. AND I'M NOT GOING TO SPECULATE. I WILL LET THE EXPERTS DO THAT. AND SO THE ONLY TIME THAT I HAVE BEEN ON NOTICE IS WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND I'M IN THE COUNTRY, NOT THAT I SHOULD WAIT FOR SOMETHING THAT I IMMEDIATELY HUB AWARE OF ANYTHING, BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE CALLED FOR. IT WASN'T CALLED FOR. ON YOUR VISIT TO KENOSHA TOMORROW, LOCAL OFFICIALS DISCOURAGED PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM VISITING AND YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL N ARCH A CRMP P SAID THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE EITHER CANDIDATE VISIT. WHY IS NOW THE RIGHT TIME FOR YOU TO GO TO KENOSHA AND WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH TOMORROW? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: I HAVE AN OUTSTANDING CALL WITH THE GOVERNOR AND DEALT WITH STAFF BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING REQUESTS THAT I DO COME BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE HAVE TO HEAL AND BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. MY PURPOSE IN GOING TO BE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON WHAT'S GOING ON, TALK ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND TRY TO SEE IF THERE IS A MECHANISM TO BRING THE FOLKS TOGETHER. WE HAVE TO HEAL. THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD. AND SO, I HAVE GOTTEN ADVICE FROM SITTING MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS AND SENATE AS WELL TO GO AND THAT I SHOULD GO AND I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN MEET , MEETING WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS AS WELL AS BUSINESS PEOPLE AND OTHER FOLKS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TO SEE , START TO TALK WHAT HAS TO BE DONE. I'M NOT GOING TO TELL KENOSHA WHAT HAS TO BE DONE BUT WE DO TOGETHER. THE IDEA WE ARE SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS RETREAT TO THEIR CORNERS AND KEEP THIS MOVING IS JUST A MISTAKE. I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE INCLUDING THIS CITY, BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND BRINGING PEOPLE AND POLICE OFFICERS TOGETHER AND BUSINESS LEADERS AND CIVIC LEADERS AND THAT'S MY PURPOSE IN GOING. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE TRAVELING TO WISCONSIN AT ALL, THIS IS ONLY THE THIRD TIME IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THAT YOU WILL BE ON A PLANE. YOU HAVE TALKT ABOUT HOW YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF YOUR DOCTORS IN TERMS OF CAMPAIGNING SAFELY BUT THE QUESTION IS WHY AREN'T YOU OUT THERE MORE. THE PRESIDENT WAS CALLING YOUR CAMPAIGN SCHEDULE TODAY? HOW ARE YOU WILLING TO PUSH IT AND SPEAK TO THE VOTERS DIRECTLY? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: MY MESSAGE IS GETTING OUT BASED ON THE POLLING DATA SHOWS AND WHAT I HAVE SAID AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I HAVE SAID IT. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO GET OUT MORE. BUT A PRESIDENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SET THE RIGHT EXAMPLE HOW TO GO OUT AND NOT WEAR A MASK AND NOT HAVE LARGE CROWDS OF PEOPLE NOT WEARING MASKS OR AR CALL DRON FOR SIGNIFICANT OUTBREAKS OF COVID. AND SO WHAT I HAVE DONE IS I HAVE MET WITH THE , VIA , WHAT I DID THIS MORNING WITH THE MEDICAL EXPERTS. AND SO, WE HAVE WORKED OUT A PROTOCOL HOW I GET IN THE PLANE, WHAT KIND OF A PLANE, HOW IT IS SANITIZED AND HOW I ENGAGE PEOPLE LIKE I ENGAGE WITH ALL OF YOU. IT IS ALWAYS AT A SAFE DISTANCE AND EVERYONE IS WEARING MASKS AND VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE I'M MEETING WITH HAVE COME INTO MY HOME AND ALL TESTED AS WELL. I'M JUST TRYING TO SET THE EXAMPLE AND WEARING THE PROTECTIVE GEAR, A MASK, WHICH I HAVE WITH ME. I'M ABLE AT THIS DISTANCE TO TAKE IT OFF, NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, MAKE SURE WE PROCEED IN WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING. THEY ANNOUNCED THE MODERATEORS AND KRISTEN WELKER. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD DISSUADE YOU AND HOW HAVE YOU BEGUN TO PREPARE? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: I'M GOING OVER WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID AND MULTIPLE LIES HE HAS TOLD. WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IS A FACT CHECKER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN IF WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING. THAT WOULD MAKE A GREAT, GREAT DEBATE IF BOTH OF US SAID WAS INSTANTLY FACT CHECKED BY AN AGREED-TO GROUP OF PEOPLE. BUT THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T GET FAR IN THE DEBATE. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO DEBATING THE PRESIDENT AND I'M GOING TO LAY OUT AS CLEARLY AS I CAN WHAT I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK AND BRING IT BACK BETTER AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO DEBATE. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE HEARD A LOT FROM VOTERS IS THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE WORRIED AND CONCERNED ABOUT THE ONGOING VIOLENCE INCLUDING THE SITUATION IN KENOSHA, WISCONSIN. I'M CURIOUS, YOU ARE NOT PRESIDENT NOW BUT DONALD TRUMP IS, BUT IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE KEPT SAFE? FIRST OF ALL, I WOULDN'T IN CITE VIOLENCE AND CONDEMN IT WHEN IT OCCURS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS ARE GOOD, HONEST, DECENT MEN AND WOMEN. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO HOME THAT NIGHT SAFELY, THE VAST MAJORITY. BUT JUST THOSE WHO ARE NOT GOOD COPS, ALL THE POLICE I HAVE DEALT WITH MY WHOLE LIFE AND I HAVE BEEN , I HAVE GOTTEN OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE CAREER. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THE BAD COPS BECAUSE IT REFLECTS BAD ON THEM. NUMBER TWO, I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT ANY VIOLENCE, ANY VIOLENCE, PROTESTING IS A RIGHT AND FREE SPEECH IS A RIGHT. BUT TO ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE, BURNING, LOOTING AND THE REST IN THE NAME OF PROTESTING IS WRONG. AND THE PERSON PES SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. AND SO WHAT I WOULD BE DOING I WOULD BE BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW AND HAVING THAT POLICE COMMISSION SET UP AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE TABLE AND HAVE THE COMMUNITY AT THE TABLE AND HAVE PEOPLE AND SAYING, HOW DO WE GET THROUGH THIS? BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE AS WELL AS LAW ENFORCEMENT WANT TOLL STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT, NOT INFLAME THINGS. BUT THIS PRESIDENT KEEPS THROWING GASOLINE ON THE FIRE EVERY PLACE HE GOES. I NOTICED , I DIDN'T WATCH MUCH OF IT BUT I WATCHED ALL THE REPORTS FROM ALL OF YOU, FROM THE PRESS, AND YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WAS ASKED WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH REGARD TO A YOUNG MAN SHOT IN THE BACK SEVEN TIMES TIMES IN FRONT OF HIS CHILDREN, I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING. AND WENT ON DOWN THE LINE. I WISH HE WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. AS MUCH AS HE WOULD LIKE TO BE RUNNING AGAINST SOMEBODY ELSE, HE IS RUNNING AGAINST ME, JOE BIDEN AND THE FACT HE IS NOT ACTING VERY RESPONSIBLY. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE OUTLINED YOUR PLAN TO REOPEN SCHOOLS SAFELY BUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE INTERIM. RIGHT NOW, MILLIONS OF PARENTS ARE FACING THIS VERY IMPOSSIBLE TASK OF TRYING TO WORK FULL-TIME AND HELP THEIR CHILDREN FULL-TIME TO LEARN VIRTUALLY. WHAT ARE YOUR MESSAGE TO THESE PARENTS AND WHAT CAN YOU DO TO HELP THEM? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: I HAVE LAID OUT A PLAN FOR CHILD CARE, A PLAN FOR EARLY EDUCATION AS WELL SO THREE, FOUR, FIVE-YEAR-OLDS ARE IN SCHOOL. BUT I'M NOT PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW. WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IS PROVIDING FOR MORE HELP FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FACT TRYING TO JUGGLE THE CHOICE BETWEEN DO I STAY HOME WITH MY THREE, FOUR, FIVE-YEAR-OLD AND TAKE CARE OF THEM IN THIS COVID PROBLEM OR DO I GO TO WORK OR EARN A SALARY. WHAT DO I DO? I HAVE A MAJOR INITIATIVE TO DEAL WITH CHILD CARE AND ELDER CARE SO PEOPLE CAN BE PAID TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN AS WELL AS THE ELDERLY, HUSBAND OR WIFE MAY BE TAKING CARE OF AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THOSE FOLKS ARE ABLE TO GET BACK TO WORK. AND FOCUSING ON DAY CARE CENTERS AND MAKING SURE THEY ARE SAFE AND HEALTHY NOW ARE AS EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS DEALING WITH SCHOOLS. AND WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING ALL OF THE P.P.E. AND ALL OF THE SAFETY THAT IS NECESSARY TO ALLOW THEM TO OPEN. HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN OPENED BECAUSE SOME STATES HAVE GONE IN AND DONE THAT. THERE SHOULD BE UNIVERSAL GUIDANCE COMING FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND SHOULD BE BASIC STANDARDS TO HOW, IN FACT AND WHAT CIRCUMSTANCE YOU CAN OPEN A SAFELY A DAY CARE OR CHILD CARE CENTER. THE IDEA THAT THIS HAS BROUGHT HOME A NUMBER OF DEMRARING PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN AMERICA, THIS WHOLE PANDEMIC AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN TERMS OF JOBS. THE IDEA THAT WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE SO MANY PARENTS WHO HAVE TO MAKE THE DIFFICULT CHOICE AS A SINGLE PARENT OR BOTH WORKING PARENTS TO DECIDE ONE GIVES UP THEIR SALARY AND STAY HOME WITH A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE OR SIX AND\/OR LEAVES THEM WITH SOMEBODY THAT IS NOT PARTICULARLY QUALIFIED AND GOES TO WORK SO THEY CAN EARN A LIVING IS A CHOICE WE SHOULDN'T BE MAKING. WE ARE THE MOST STRILIZED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. AND BE ABLE TO GO TO WORK. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A MAJOR OF MY BUILD BACK BETTER PROGRAM. IN THE MEANTIME, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO BE DONE IS HAVE C.D.C. ISSUE STRAIGHTFORWARD GUIDELINES UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPEN UP YOUR DAY CARE CENTER OR CHILD CARE CENTER NOW. AND THERE SHOULD BE CLEAR STANDARDS AND STATES SHOULD HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO GO OUT AND INSPECT THOSE FACILITIES NOW. BUT ONE THING I HAVEN'T MENTIONED AND WARRANTS MENTIONING, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID, REMEMBER WHEN WE INHERITED THE GREAT RECESSION AND WE WERE GOING INTO THE TANK HEADING OFF THE CLIFF HEADING INTO A DEPRESSION, I WAS ABLE TO CHANGE THREE REPUBLICANS' VOTE AND ENDED UP WITH THE RECOVERY ACT WHICH SPENT $800 BILLION. WHAT DID WE DO? WE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MAKING SURE THAT STATES WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. EVERYONE FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, THEIR SCHOOL TEACHERS, THEIR DOCTORS, NURSES, PUBLIC HOSPITALS. NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING? THIS REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT SUPPORT THAT AND THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE WILL NOT SUPPORT IT. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING? WE DON'T HAVE THAT HELP. IT'S NOT OUT HERE AND STATES ARE IN REAL TROUBLE AND TO QUOTE MITCH MCCONNELL, HE SAID LET THE STATES GO BANKRUPT. STATES HAVE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS UNDER THE LAW. THERE IS A REASON WHY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ABLE TO RUN A DEFICIT, TO COMPENSATE IN TIMES OF REAL ECONOMIC CRISIS. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING? NOTHING. NOTHING. AND GUESS WHAT? WE CAME OUT OF THAT RECESSION WITH THE LONGEST SPURT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH OF ANY ADMINISTRATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY. BUT THESE GUYS , I COULD GO ON. BUSINESSES, LOOK AT THE MONEY THAT WAS PASSED UNDER THE CARES ACT FOR BUSINESSES. SMALL BUSINESSES TO BE ABLE TO STAY OPEN. WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. WHY? BECAUSE THE MONEY DIDN'T GET TO SMALL BUSINESSES. THEY ARE NOT OPEN. WE SHOULD BE DEALING WITH THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN BURNT OUT AND DAMAGED. WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING FEDERAL HELP FOR THOSE BUSINESSES TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. THIS ADMINISTRATION SEEMS TO THINK IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY LIKE ANGEL DUST IS GOING TO BE SPREAD AROUND. I JUST DON'T GET IT. THEY HAVE TO KNOW BETTER. THEY HAVE TO KNOW BETTER. AND WE HAD AN EXAMPLE IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION HOW MUCH GOOD YOU CAN DO AND HOW MUCH GROWTH CAN YOU GENERAL RATE. I DON'T GET THESE GUYS. NOT A JOKE. I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME BUT NEVER SEEN A PRESIDENT LACK IN LEADERSHIP AND UNWILLING TO MAKE A DEAL AND I'M TOLD THE REASON THEY CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE IN THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS IS 20 MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE SAYING UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THEY RAISE THE DEFICIT AT ALL. THAT'S WONDERFUL. AND WE ARE IN A POSITION RIGHT NOW. LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES, DOING ONE HELL OF A LOT BETTER AND UP TO 186,000 PEOPLE DEAD, 6 MILLION 300,000 THAT HAVE CONTRACTED THE DISEASE. IT'S JUST IRRESPONSIBLE. TALK ABOUT A NO-NOTHING CONGRESS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. NO-NOTHING PRESIDENT. I DON'T GET IT. I DON'T GET IT. IT'S GOING TO CHANGE COME JANUARY, GOD WILLING. I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERN BECAUSE SOME TEACHERS HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS BECAUSE IF THEY WERE TO CONTRACT COVID-19 THAT THEY WOULD BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO BE IN REAL TROUBLE. IT IS UNDERSTANDING WHY THEY ARE DOING IT. BUT THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE PROTECTIVE CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US IS MADE AVAILABLE AND THEN MAKE CHOICES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT LET THE DISTRICTS MAKE CHOICES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY OPEN FULLY AND ROTATE AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE TEACHERS ARE ABLE TO TEACH FROM HOME AND REMOTE LEARNING. BUT IT'S REALLY UNDERSTANDABLE. LOOK, LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS COVID CRISIS SO FAR. 100,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED WHO ARE ABOVE THE AGE OF 65. 100 AND SOME OUT OF THE 180,000. THE ESTIMATES RANGE UP TO SIGNIFICANT UNIVERSITIES, ONE IS GOING TO BE AS MANY AS 239 AND OTHER ONE SAID 312. I DON'T KNOW THAT, BUT IT'S GOING TO GO HIGHER. SO I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S A POLITICAL PROBLEM. WHAT IS THE POLITICS ABOUT NOT BEING WILLING TO GO IN AND HELP PROVIDE THE PROTECTIVE CAPACITY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK AND GO TO SCHOOL. I CAN'T FATHOM IT. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. YOU TALKED TODAY ABOUT REOPENING SCHOOLS. I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING YOU SAID LAST WEEK, THE POTENTIAL OF HAVING TO SHUT DOWN THE ECONOMY AGAIN. YOU WERE ASKED IF YOU WERE GOING TO SHUT IT DOWN IF YOUR HEALTH EXPERTS PROPOSED AND YOU SAID YOU WOULD LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS. HOW YOU WOULD DO THAT AT A FEDERAL LEVEL AND HOW YOU WOULD BALANCE THAT CALL TO SHUTDOWN IF YOUR ECONOMIC ADVISERS SAYING, IF YOU DO IT AGAIN, YOU COULD PLUNGE THE COUNTRY INTO A DEEPER ECONOMIC CRISIS. WELL, LOOK, I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS SINCE LAST JANUARY. THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO GET THE ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK WITHOUT GETTING COVID UNDER CONTROL IS COMPLETELY COUNTERINTUITIVE, IT'S NOT THERE AND CAN'T HAVE IT. UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE DISEASE AND DRASTICALLY ITS IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE TO EITHER GO TO WORK OR WALK INTO A BUSINESS OR DO BUSINESS, THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER A LOT. THERE IS GOING TO BE NO NEED IN MY VIEW TO SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE ECONOMY. IF I WAS ASKED TO SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN, I TOOK THAT AS A GENERIC QUESTION IF I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE SCIENCE. I AM GOING TO INSIST AND INSIST NOW WITHOUT ANY AUTHORITY THAT EVERY RESPONSIBLE PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN THEY ARE OUT IN PUBLIC OR NOT THE COHORT THEY HAVE LIVED WITH BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN SPREADING TO THEIR WIFE OR HUSBAND, THAT THEY WEAR A MASK AND WEAR A MASK. YOU CAN TAKE THE MASK OFF WHEN YOU ARE 12, 15 FEET AWAY. I WOULD FOLLOW, I WOULD REALLY MAKE THE CASE , AND BY THE WAY, WHEN I FIND THESE FOLKS TALKING ABOUT MY FREEDOM, I TALK ABOUT PATRIOTISM. WHY DO YOU WEAR A MASK? TO PROTECT YOUR NEIGHBOR, TO KEEP SOMEONE ELSE FROM GETTING SICK AND MAYBE DYING. I CALL THAT PATRIOTIC. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. EVERY GENERATION HAS MADE SACRIFICES TO HELP OTHERS IN MOMENTS OF CRIES SEES. YOU SUGGEST THERE WOULD BE SOME KIND OF FEDERAL MANDATE ABOUT MASKS? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: NO. NO. WHAT I SUGGESTED WAS, I WOULD ASK EVERY PERSON IN AUTHORITY, THERE'S A QUESTION WHETHER THE PRESIDENT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION COULD MANDATE THAT EVERYONE COULD WEAR A MASK. DURING THE PRIMARY PEOPLE WERE TELLING ME , I'M A CONSTITUTIONALIST. YOU CAN'T DO THINGS THAT THE CONSTITUTION DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO DO. I WILL PUT PRESSURE ON EVERY GOVERNOR, EVERY MAYOR, COUNTY EXECUTIVE AND LOCAL OFFICIAL AND EVERYONE IN BUSINESS TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEM TO SAY WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS IRRESPONSIBLE. MAKE SURE YOU WEAR A MASK AND MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT. YOU RAISED A MONTHLY. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SPEND IT? VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: YOU WANT TO GO TO DINNER? [LAUGHTER] VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: WHAT I'M HAVING TO SPEND A LOT OF IT ON IS COUNTER THE LIES THAT ARE BEING TOLD BY MY TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN AND A NEW P.A.C. BUT I'M TRYING TO SPEND MOST OF THAT , I THINK THE AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION WAS LIKE 40 BUCKS. WE HAVE OVER 1 MILLION 600,000 PEOPLE WHO CONTRIBUTED, BETWEEN 5, 10, $15 DOLLARS. THERE IS ENTHUSIASM ABOUT WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND SO WHAT I WILL SPEND MOST OF IT DOING IS TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HOW I WANT TO UNITE THE COUNTY AND WHAT I WANT TO DO TO MAKE THE COUNTRY BETTER AND WHY I'M SO CONFIDENT WE CAN DO IT AND BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AND BE IN A BETTER POSITION THAN BEFORE THIS CRISIS OCCURRED, BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SO MANY FISSURES EXPOSED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT HAPPENED, AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING I DIDN'T KNOW THAT PEOPLE IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE DIDN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF HELP. SO WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. AND ONCE AGAIN, LEAD THE WORLD. YOU HEARD ME SAY IT 100 TIMES NOT JUST BY EXAMPLE OF POWER BUT POWER OF EXAMPLE. THANK YOU. [INDISCERNIBLE] VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: MARVELOUS JOB, DOING A GREAT JOB. WHEN IT GOT UP TO MARCH, I KEPT SAYING, LOOK , YOU REMEMBER I WAS THE FIRST, PERSON CALLING ABOUT THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT. WE DON'T HAVE , IT'S AMAZING, WE USE A PHRASE LIKE P.P.E., BUT PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND GEAR AND VENTILATORS. USE THAT AUTHORITY NOW AND DON'T WAIT AND DON'T WAIT TO TALK ABOUT US THE NEED TO HAVE MASKS. THAT'S WHAT I TALKED ABOUT AND I BEGUN TO LAY UP , WE ACTUALLY HAD A CONVERSATION. MAYBE IT WAS MARCH, APRIL, IN THAT RANGE AND HE SAID BIDEN WANTS TO HELP. SO I TALKED TO HIM AND LAID OUT WHAT I THOUGHT SHOULD BE DONE TO REOPEN SAFELY AND HE WAS VERY POLITE AND LISTENED AND SAID HE WOULD THINK ABOUT IT AND THAT WAS THE END OF IT. SO WHAT I WOULD BEGIN TO BECOME REALLY CLEAR IS THAT AS THE SCIENCE BEGAN TO SHOW THAT THIS WAS ABLE TO SPREAD MUCH MORE EASILY THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT. WAS THE PANDEMIC COMING AND WHAT'S THE MOST WAY THAT DID THE MOST DAMAGE. AS THAT BECAME CLEARER AND CLEARER. WE CONCLUDED WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE LARGE RALLIES. HERE WE ARE, REST OF THE WORLD PLACES HAVE GONE EXTREMELY WELL IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH THIS COVID CRISIS AROUND THE WORLD. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THE FIVE LARGEST COUNTRIES IN EUROPE HAVE A POPULATION LARGER THAN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, YET, IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST, LOSING 1,000 LIVES A DAY AND LOSING 57 A DAY, ALL OF THEM, COMBINED. COMBINED. AS WE LEARN MORE AND DID LEARN MORE AND WHY BY MARCH AND APRIL, WE KNEW A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT MORE, WHY WEREN'T WE DOING WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE? WHY ARE WE BEING TOLD WE HAVE PLENTY OF PROTECTIVE GEAR. AND ONE BIG THING THAT I DID PUSH A LOT ON WAS ON THE NEED FOR TESTING AND TRACING AND MOVING RAPIDLY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAD THE CAPACITY TO TEST AND TRACE BEFORE IT GOT SO OUT OF CONTROL. WE NEED TO DO THAT NOW. BUT HERE'S THE THING AND I END WITH THIS AND I APOLOGIZE FOR KEEPING YOU , [INDISCERNIBLE] [LAUGHTER] VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN: THE THING THAT I JUST DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IS WHEN IT'S CLEAR THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS ARE SIMPLY NOT TRUE RELATING TO THIS CRISIS. AND WHEN ENORMOUS PRESSURE IS PUT ON PROFESSIONALS IN THE ADMINISTRATION FROM THE C.D.C. TO N.I.H. ACROSS THE BOARD, WHY DO WE THINK GOD WILLING WHEN WE GET A VACCINE THAT IS GOOD, WORKS, WHY DO WE THINK THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO LINE UP TO BE ABLE TO BE WILLING TO TAKE THE INJECTION? HE HAS LOST SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN WHAT'S SAID BECAUSE THEY ARE FINDING OUT AGAIN TODAY, PLASMA, WELL, IT DOESN'T WORK OUT. HELL OF A LOT OF PRESSURE PUT ON THAT PERSON WHO SOLD IT. THIS PRESIDENT HAS SOLD SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE UNTRUE, THAT ARE JUST WRONG. IN ORDER TO DO ANYTHING, HE LOOKS AT IT IN ONE WAY, IF THE STOCK MARKET IS HIGH AND IT'S MOVING AND WE ARE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN REAL TROUBLE ECONOMICALLY, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I SAY, THAT'S THE OBJECTIVE. THAT'S THE OBJECTIVE. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO KEEP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFE SO WE CAN BEGIN TO GET BACK TO NORMAL AND REBUILDING OUR ECONOMY AND BRINGING BACK ECONOMIC GROWTH. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

YOUNGER PEOPLE IN GENERAL HAVE A VERY, VERY LOW RISK OF DEATH OR SERIOUS ILLNESS FROM COVID-19. SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN, 1-15 IN AGE, ONLY ABOUT 40 HAVE DIED IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. 57 MILLION PEOPLE IN THAT AGE BRACKET, AND ONLY 36-40 HAVE DIED, THAT IS ABOUT ONE IN A MILLION. SO THAT IS A PRETTY LOW RATIO. WHEN YOU THING ABOUT THE OTHER THINGS THAT KIDS DIE FROM, DROWNING, CAR ACCIDENTS, THEY HAPPEN AT A HIGHER FREQUENCY THAN ABOUT 39 OR 40. WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. BIDEN: HI. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. I TO WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THIS EVENT HAS BEEN SET UP TO ADHERE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES.

YOU SPENT MOST OF YOUR CAREER UNIFYING PEOPLE, BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. MUCH LIKE YOUR HOMETOWN, SCRANTON, Y YOU'VE OFTEN TALKED ABOUT FAMILY VALUES. WORKING CLASS FAMILIES. KENOSHA IS THAT KIND OF TOWN. WHERE WE COME TOGETHER AS PEOPLE, AND WHAT UNITES US IN OUR INNER SOUL IS LOVE, COMPASSION. ON THIS TIME OF HEALING AND HURT AND PAIN, WE NEED THAT LOVE AND COMPASSION. AND, WE KNOW YOUR LEADERSHIP IS ALL ABOUT UNITY, NOT DIVISION. IT'S ABOUT HEALING. SO, WE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE KNOW YOUR LEADERSHIP IS IMPORTANT IN KENOSHA AND IN OUR COUNTRY. WE ALSO KNOW , LET'S BE CLEAR, BLACK AMERICANS FACE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN A VARIETY OF AREAS. MUCH LIKE MANY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. FAR TOO LONG. WE KNOW, WITH YOUR VISION AND YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR SENSE OF URGENCY TO DISMANTLE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN HEALTH CARE, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, EDUCATION, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WE KNOW YOUR VISION WILL HEAL THIS COUNTRY. WE KNOW YOUR VISION WILL BRING NEIGHBORHOODS BACK TOGETHER, AND WE THANK YOU FOR THAT. NOW, IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU OUR HOST, REVEREND BARKER. REV. BARKER: WELCOME, EVERYBODY. IT IS A REAL PRIVILEGE TO LOOK OUT ON MY NEIGHBORS HERE IN KENOSHA, AND I CAN SEE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD , THE CORE OF THEIR LIFE SEEKING WELFARE FOR OUR CITY. IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY. IT IS A REAL PRIVILEGE TO HAVE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN HERE TODAY TO LISTEN AND TO SEEK HEALING AND JUSTICE FOR US IN KENOSHA. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME THIS AFTERNOON. PLEASE RISE AS I OFFER A PRAYER. LET US PRAY. OH, HEALING GOD, WE CONTINUE TO LIFT UP JACOB BLAKE. LORD, CONTINUE TO BRING HEALING TO HIS GRIEVOUS WOUNDS. LORD MIRACULOUSLY ENABLE HIM TO WALK AGAIN. LIFT UP HIS FAMILY. BRING THEM COMFORT DURING THIS TUMULTUOUS, CHALLENGING TIME. OH, GOD OF JUSTICE, WE ASK FOR JUSTICE FOR JACOB BLAKE. WE ASK FOR JUSTICE FOR OUR COMMUNITY HERE IN KENOSHA. OH I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT WORK YOU DO IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. NOT FAR FROM HERE, WE HAVE DEVASTATION AND DESTRUCTION. WE KNOW YOUR CHURCH HAS A LEADERSHIP ROLE THAT RECOVERY SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND MANY BLESSINGS. HERE WE ARE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HERE TO HAVE A COMMUNITY CONVERSATION. A FEW GROUND RULES. IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY AND HEALTH, THAT WE PROTECT OURSELVES, , WE FOUR SELECTED SPEAKERS WE WILL START WITH. I WILL CALL THEM UP, LET THEM SPEAK. SPEAK TO THE MIC CLOSEST TO YOU. AFTER THEY ARE FINISHED, WE WILL CALL UP FOLKS. WE ASK THAT YOU PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING. THE MICROPHONES WILL BE HERE. TAKE YOUR TIME. WE WILL GIVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES PER PERSON. I HAVE BEEN TOLD I HAVE THE RIGHT TO PUT THE MASK OVER YOUR MOUTH AND SHUT IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT, BUT TAKE YOUR TIME. BECAUSE YOU KNOW, VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS HERE TO LISTEN, LEARN AND HELP US HEAL. FAIR ENOUGH? FIRST, TIM, RESIDNENT AND FORMER MARINE. THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THAT'S OCCURRING IN WISCONSIN IS SOMETHING THAT IS AN AMERICAN ISSUE, AND THAT IS ABOUT RACE INEQUALITY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RACE INEQUALITY IN AMERICA, WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND THE CONVERSATION OF PROGRAMS. WE NEED TO START PUTTING MONEY BEHIND THE PROGRAMS AND PUTTING THINGS INTO ACTION. SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BEN CARSON , SORRY, BEN GORDON WITH THE NAACP SAID, WE KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE. WE NEED TO START PUTTING MONEY BEHIND THE SOLUTIONS. WE KNOW WITH THE PROBLEMS ARE IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. WIN OVER THE PROBLEMS ARE IN THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. BUT WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING AT WISCONSIN, WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE WORST PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR, 34% OF AFGHAN AMERICANS LIVE IN POVERTY. 24% OF HISPANICS. 28% OF NATIVE AMERICAN INDIANS. AND 18% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ASIAN DESCENT. SO, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT RACE INEQUALITY, IT ALSO MEANS ABOUT INCLUSION AND TAKING THOSE STEPS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF EMPLOYMENT. WE HAVE ALL OF THESE JOBS AROUND HERE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE MEDIUM INCOME AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHITE FAMILIES AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN IS 50%. WE ARE EARNING 50% OF THE WHAT THOSE FAMILY INCOMES ARE. IF WE ARE NOT PAYING PEOPLE LIVING WAGES , THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY THAT WAS HERE, THE WHITE AMERICAN BRASS , WE'RE A COMMUNITY THAT BUILT THINGS. WE HAVE A LOT OF INTELLIGENT PEOPLE, A LOT OF SKILLS THAT ARE STILL HERE. IT IS JUST TAPPING INTO THOSE RESOURCES AND CREATING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES IN EMPLOYMENT. WHEN I WAS THE HR DIRECTOR IN A MUNICIPALITY, ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID WAS BANND THE BOX. WE DON'T NEED TO LOOK FOR NEW EMPLOYEES. WE ARE PUSHING THEM OUT OF THE PRISON SYSTEM EACH AND EVERY DAY. WHEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS COME BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES, WE NEED TO START PROVIDING SECOND CHANCES FOR THEM. WE ALSO NEED TO ADDRESS THE GAPS WITHIN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. NOT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM, BUT WE HAVE A PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT IS NOT EQUITABLE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH PROGRAM AND EVERY SCHOOL IS THE SAME. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT BLACK SPORTS PROGRAMS AND WHITE SPORTS PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED THE SAME. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT SCIENCE PROGRAMS AND ART PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED THE SAME. NOT THAT THEY JUST EXIST, BUT THAT THEY HAVE THE SAME QUALITY AND THEY ARE THE SAME QUILT. BECAUSE YOU CANNOT BUILD PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE SAME RESOURCES AND ECONOMIC ABILITY TO PUSH THOSE FORWARD TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THE BIGGEST THING I SEE GOING ON RIGHT NOW, AND IT JUST BREAKS MY HEART, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RACE INEQUALITY, WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOUSING. WE LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON DURING THIS COVID. WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF NOT HAVING THAT ECONOMICS, NOT BEING AT WORK AT THIS TIME. THEY ARE LOSING HOUSING. IF YOU LOOK OVER, IT IS HEARTBREAKING TO SEE ALL THESE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, IN THE MIDDLE OF JUST HAVING A HURRICANE COME THROUGH THIS AREA, AND NOW THEY ARE BEING PLACED ON THE STREETS WITH THEIR BELONGINGS. WE HAVE TO MOVE BEYOND THAT. THE OTHER THING THAT IS STILL OUT THERE IS WE NEED TO CREATE JOBS. WE NEED TO CREATE LIVING WAGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN BE APART OF THAT AMERICAN DREAM. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, BUT WE HAVE SUCH A WONDERFUL PERSON HERE THAT WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. WE HAVE TO REALIZE WE HAVE TO STOP PUSHING PEOPLE INTO JAIL. WE HAVE TO START GETTING SOLUTIONS SUCH AS REHABILITATION. WHEN THE CRACK EPIDEMIC HIT AMERICA, IT WAS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. AMERICA SOLUTION WAS JAIL, JAIL, JAIL. NOW THAT WE HAVE OPIOIDS IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY, THE SOLUTION IS TO PROVIDE POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS WITH NARCAN, SEND THEM BACK TO THEIR FAMILIES AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE REHABILITATION SERVICES. WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND WE DON'T HAVE THE DRUG ADDICTION AND OTHER SERVICES NEEDED TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM GETTING CAUGHT UP IN A CYCLE THAT TAKES AWAY FROM THAT AMERICAN DREAM AND TAKES AWAY FROM THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR EQUITY. THANK YOU. VICE PRES. BIDEN: THANK YOU. THANKS FOR COMING. THANKS FOR LISTENING. OUR MEMBERS ARE TIRED AFTER THIS PAST WEEK. SOME OF THEM ARE BEAT UP PRETTY GOOD, BUT THEIR SPIRTSITS ARE HIGH. THE REASON WHY THEIR SPIRITS ARE HIGH IS BECAUSE OF THEIR APPRECIATION AND LOVE OUR COMMUNITY HAS SHOWN US AFTER THE FIRES. EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN DROPPED OFF AT THE FIREHOUSES TO PEOPLE STOPPING US ON THE STREETS TELLING US THANKS. IT MAY BE THINK ABOUT APPRECIATION. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT LEVELS NEED TO START SHOWING APPRECIATION FOR ONE ANOTHER, AND LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT EVERYBODY MATTERS. I KNOW I FEEL GOOD WHEN I FEEL APPRECIATED. I THINK IT'S A BASIC HUMAN THING THAT EVERYBODY ELSE DOES, TOO. ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE SO MANY SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS IN PEOPLE'S HOMES BEFORE THERE IS A PROGRAM, BEFORE THERE IS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, BEFORE THIS IS AN ACTUAL PROBLEM. I'VE SEEN IT FOR 30 YEARS. I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS GETTING BETTER EVERY DAY, BUT IT'S NOT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF PEOPLE OF COLOR, IS THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE ATA A TIME WHEN IT IS , WHEN IT HAS THE CHANCE TO BE PREVENTATIVE, TO BE HEALING. SO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE ARE A RESULT OF CHRONIC ABILITY NOT TO GET THAT HEALTH CARE. THOSE SMALL THINGS TURN INTO CHRONIC THINGS. THE MOST CHRONIC THINGS TURN INTO EMERGENCIES. THAT'S WHEN WE GET CALLED. AS A RESULT OF THAT, OUR SYSTEMS ARE BEING TAXED. IN MANY CASES , WE HAVE EVEN ASKED PEOPLE WHY DID YOU NOT SEEK HELP FROM YOUR DOCTOR? I DON'T HAVE A DOCTOR. WHY DID YOU NOT TAKE THIS HEART MEDICATION? I CAN'T AFFORD IT. NOW, WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE YOU ARE TAKING A TRIP TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. AT TIMES, WE ARE THE ONLY HEALTH CARE THAT SOME FOLKS HAVE ACCESS TO. WE NEVER FAILED TO SHOW UP. WE SHOW UP DAMN FAST. AND SOMETIMES EVEN THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. SO, THOSE ARE SOME OF THINGS THAT WE SEE WITH REGARD TO A PROBLEM IN THE COMMUNITY THAT NEEDS ATTENTION. IF THERE WERE CLINICS OR THERE WERE AVAILABILITY FOR LOW-LEVEL HEALTH CARE ACCESS, WE WOULDN'T SEE QUITE SO MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH FROM AN EMERGENT STANDPOINT. AGAIN, PRIDE, DEDICATION AND COURAGE , THAT'S WHAT WE ALL SIGNED UP FOR. OUR THUMBS ARE UP AND WE'RE FORGING FORWARD AND WE WOULD LIKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO FEEL THE SAME APPRECIATION WE DO. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. APPRECIATE IT. CAN I TOUCH THIS? THANK YOU, JOE, FOR BEING HERE. IT IS A GREAT HONOR FOR ME TO BE INVITED HERE. MY NAME IS BARB. MY SISTER AND I HAVE A FRAMING AND ART GALLERY TWO BLOCKS DOWN THE ROAD. OUR GREAT GRANDFATHER STARTED OUR BUSINESS AND OUR BUSINESS HAS SUCCEEDED THROUGH RECHERCHE RECESSIONS, DEPRESSIONS AND ALL THE DIFFICULTIES THAT HAPPEN, BUT WE HAVE NEVER, EVER SEEN ANYTHING AS DEVASTATING AS WHAT HAS GONE ON IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T START OUR BUILDING ON FIRE, LIKE SO MANY OF THEM IN THE UPTOWN AREA HAVE BEEN BURNT TO THE GROUND. THEY DID BREAK OUR WINDOWS, GET INTO OUR STORE. THEY LOOTED AND THEY TRIED TO START A FIRE, BUT A GOOD SAMARITAN CAME BY AND TOOK THIS RACK OF OUR BEAUTIFUL SCARVES OUT INTO THE SIDEWALK AND PUT IT OUT. OTHERWISE, OUR STORE WOULD HAVE BEEN UP IN FLAMES. I LOOK AT THE BUILDINGS IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE GONE AND I JUST , I DON'T THINK I'VE REALLY GRIEVED AS MUCH AS I FEEL I SHOULD BECAUSE, BEING A BUSINESS OWNER, I HAVE TO KEEP GOING. I HAVE TO KEEP WORKING. THE DAY AFTER THIS HAPPENED AT OUR STORE , SUNDAY, THEY WENT DOWNTOWN AND DID THEIR DEVASTATION. THEN ON MONDAY NIGHT, THEY CAME IN OUR AREA. TUESDAY MORNING, WE HAD A GROUP OF FELLAS COME UP AND BOARD UP OUR BUILDING AND WE WERE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. WE'VE BEEN CONTINUING TO BE OPEN FOR BUSINESS EVEN THOUGH IT IS BOARDED UP. THE LOVE AND COMPASSION IN THIS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING NOT ONLY TO US, BUT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. PEOPLE ARE COMING TOGETHER AND SHOWING RESPECT AND LOVE TOWARDS EACH OTHER. IT MAKES ME SO VERY PROUD TO BE IN THIS COMMUNITY. THAT'S WHAT WE DO WHEN WE HAVE DIFFICULTY. WE SUPPORT AND HELP AND LOVE. SO, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME HERE AND GIVE YOU A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE. WE'RE LUCKY WE ARE STILL STANDING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, BARBARA. YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITY LOVES YOUR STORY VERY MUCH. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP REBUILD YOU, WE WILL. SIR, YOU ARE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM ONE OF THE SHARPEST, YOUNGEST LEGAL LINES IN KENOSHA, ANGELA CUNNINGHAM. PLEASE COME UP. VICE PRES. BIDEN: YOUR REPUTATION PRECEDES YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY. YOU KNOW THE REASON KENOSHA IS IN THE SPOTLIGHT RIGHT OUT IS BECAUSE OF THE SHOOTING OF JACOB BLAKE. I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT SUNDAY AFTERNOON. I WAS WATCHING A LIVE VIDEO OF SOMEONE WHO WAS ON THE SCENE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. I WAS READING THE COMMENTS AND I SAW PEOPLE COMMENTING ABOUT THE FACT JACOB BLAKE HAD BEEN SHOT BY OFFICERS. THEN, I SAW THE VIDEO OF THE ACTUAL INCIDENT. I DON'T EVEN THINK I HAVE THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW I FELT WHEN I SAW THAT VIDEO. I DO REMEMBER TEXTING MY GROUP OF FRIENDS AND SAYING THIS IS REALLY BAD. THIS IS REALLY BAD. THERE'S GOING TO BE PROTESTS, THERE'S GOING TO BE WRITING. I KNEW THAT RIGHT AWAY AFTER WATCHING THAT VIDEO. MY MOM CALLED ME. I HAVE A 20-YEAR-OLD BLACK MAN FOR A SON. MY MOM CALLED ME SHORTLY AFTER THE NEWS GOT OUT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE SHE KNOWS WE LIVE IN KENOSHA AND HER FIRST THOUGHT WAS IS SEAN OK? IS HE ALL RIGHT? I KNEW HE WAS OK BECAUSE I KNEW HE WAS AT WORK. MR. VICE PRESIDENT , I'M SPEAKING INTO THE MR. PRESIDENT PART , MR. VICE PRESIDENT, AS AN ATTORNEY I KNOW LEGALLY WHY A LOT OF OFFICERS WHO KILL BLACK MEN AND WOMEN ARE NOT HELD LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE, CRIMINALLY LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS, BECAUSE THE LAW PROTECTS THEM. I RECOGNIZE THAT AND I KNOW THAT. I DON'T AGREE WITH IT BUT I RECOGNIZE THAT AND I KNOW THAT. I HOPE THAT IF AND WHEN YOU ARE ELECTED PRESIDENT, THAT THAT IS SOMETHING YOUR ADMINISTRATION CHOOSES TO TRY TO ADDRESS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THE LAW PROTECTS A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS. I KNOW A LOT OF THOSE LAWS ARE AT THE STATE LEVEL, BUT IF AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO INCENTIVIZE STATES TO NOT GIVE SO MUCH LEGAL PROTECTION TO POLICE OFFICERS WHO KILL BLACK MEN AND WOMEN. I ALSO WANT TO TALK , AS AN ATTORNEY, I HAVE MY OWN LAW FIRM. PART OF MY PRACTICE IS DOING CRIMINAL DEFENSE WORK. I'M ALSO A FORMER PROSECUTOR OUT OF MILWAUKEE. I HAVE BEEN ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE CRIMINAL COURTS IS UN FAIFAIR TREATMENT BETWEEN WHITE DEFENDANTS VERSUS BLACK AND BROWN DEFENDANTS. THERE'S OVER POLICING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. YOU HAVE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE WHO ARE PICKED UP FOR A LOT OF TIMES WHAT COULD BE MINOR THINGS. THEN, THEY HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD. THEN, THAT CRIMINAL RECORD MEANS THEY HAVE A STAMP ON THEIR BACK THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET JOBS AND, MORE LIKELY, TO STAY INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO THEN YOU GET A RESUME THAT GETS BUILT. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE LEGISLATION PUT IN PLACE TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE OVER POLICING IN COMMUNITIES. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE SOME TRANSPARENCY IN POLICING AND PROSECUTION AND SENTENCING. BECAUSE I SIT IN COURTS, WELL, I USED TO BEFORE COVID, BUT SIT COURTS ALL DAY AND LISTEN TO CASES AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON, I'M ABLE TO SEE THE DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT IN CHARGING AND OFFERS THAT ARE GIVEN BY THE PROSECUTION AND IN SENTENCING THAT IS GIVEN BY JUDGES. ANYBODY WHO'S NOT IN COURT EVERY DAY WON'T SEE THAT. AND, THAT DATA IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A NATIONWIDE EFFORT PUT IN PLACE THAT REQUIRES POLICE DEPARTMENTS, DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES, AND ALSO COURTS TO COLLECT THE DATA ABOUT ARRESTS, ABOUT CHARGES, ABOUT SENTENCING, ABOUT OFFERS THAT ARE GIVEN SO THAT THE LIGHT CAN BE SHOWN FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T SIT IN COURT ALL DAY TO SEE THAT WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING, THERE REALLY IS A DISCREPANCY. I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST STEP THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN IN ORDER TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THEN, ONCE WE KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS ARE, START PUTTING SOME LEGISLATION IN PLACE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE DISCREPANCIES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LISTENING TODAY. THANK YOU TO OUR FOUR SPEAKERS. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO RESPOND AND CHAT WITH THE COMMUNITY? VICE PRES. BIDEN: FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY. I HOPE , I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE AFTER I SAY A FEW WORDS, WE WILL HEAR FROM MORE OF YOU AS WELL. LET ME RESPOND TO THE LITTLE BIT I HAVE HEARD SO FAR. FIRST OF ALL, I CAN MAKE A GENERIC POINT. THE WORDS OF A PRESIDENT MATTER. NO MATTER GOOD, BAD OR INDIFFERENT, THEY MATTER. NO MATTER HOW COMPETENT OR INCOMPETENT A PRESIDENT IS, THEY CAN SEND A NATION TO WAR, THEY CAN MAKE PEACE, THEY CAN MAKE MARKETS RISE AND FALL. THEY CAN DO THINGS THAT I HAVE OBSERVED THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE JUST BY WHAT THEY SAY. YOU KNOW, I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL AND I MOVED BACK TO DELAWARE. I HAD A PARTIAL SCHOLARSHIP. WE DIDN'T HAVE A LAW SCHOOL IN DELAWARE. I WENT TO SYRACUSE LAW SCHOOL. WHEN I CAME HOME FROM LAW SCHOOL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS MY LAST SEMESTER , THE ONLY TWO POLITICAL HEROES I HAD BOTH WERE ASSASSINATED. DR. KING AND BOBBY KENNEDY. KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED THE DAY I GRADUATED. I CAME HOME AND MY CITY WAS THE ONLY CITY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OCCUPIED BY THE MILITARY SINCE RECONSTRUCTION FOR 10 MONTHS. EVERY SINGLE CORNER, AND MILITARY PERSON WAS STANDING FOR 10 MONTHS. I HAD A JOB WITH A GOOD LAW FIRM. ONE OF THE OLDEST LAW FIRMS IN THE STATE. AFTER A WHILE, I CONCLUDED THAT I WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE. THEY WERE GOOD PEOPLE, BUT I QUICKLY BECAME A PUBLIC DEFENDER. I USE TOD TO HAVE INTERVIEW MY CLIENTS AND WHAT THEY CALL THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR, WHERE AMTRAK RUNS FROM WASHINGTON NEW YORK. THAT AREA GOES THROUGH MY CITY. AND, I USED TO INTERVIEW CLIENTS DOWN IN THE BASEMENT OF THAT TRAIN STATION BEFORE THEY WERE ARRAIGNED. AND HER I WARE I WAS , WE HAD THE EIGHTH LARGEST BLACK POPULATION IN THE NATION. WE WORK TO OUR GREAT SHAME A SLAVE STATE, ALTHOUGH WE WERE ONE OF THOSE BORDER STATES THAT FOUGHT ON THE STATE SIDE OF THE NORTH, THANK GOD. TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, WHAT HAPPENED WAS I THOUGHT BLACKS AND WHITES WOULD BE, IN MY CITY, WITH EACH OTHER AGAIN. HERE I AM 40 YEARS LATER ON JANUARY 17 STANDING ON A PLATFORM AND THAT VERY SAME TRAIN STATION AND LOOKING OUT OVER THE EAST SIDE WHICH HAD BEEN BURNED TO THE GROUND LITERALLY. IT HAD BEEN COMPLETELY LEVELED. ACROSS THE RIVER, THE THIRD STREET BRIDGE, 100% AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. I WAS STANDING ON THE PLATFORM ON JANUARY 17 WAITING FOR A BLACK MAN TO COME 26 MILES FROM PHILADELPHIA TO PICK ME UP AND TAKE ME ON A TRAIN RIDE TO WASHINGTON, D.C. 10,000 PEOPLE STANDING DOWN BELOW CHEERING. AND MY SON, BEAU, WAS ALIVE THEN. HE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AT THE TIME. MY DAUGHTER, WHO'S A SOCIAL WORKER. AND MY MIDDLE SON, WHO WAS RUNNING THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM, THE LARGEST PROGRAM IN THE WORLD. I CALLED THEM UP. IT ALL OF A SUDDEN HIT ME. HERE I WAS IN THAT WHOLE AREA HAD BEEN REBUILT. AND THE THIRD STREET BRIDGE IS STILL IN A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE BUT THINGS HAVE MOVED. I SAID, DON'T TELL ME THINGS CAN CHANGE. I TOLD THEM ABOUT THE STORY. I GUESS I'M VIOLATING SOCIAL DISTANCING HERE. SOSRRY. AND I SAID DON'T TELL ME THINGS CAN CHANGE. I TOLD A STORY AND REMINDED THEM WHEN I WAS A YOUNG ATTORNEY. I MADE A MISTAKE ABOUT SOMETHING. I THOUGHT YOU COULD DEFEAT HATE. HATE ONLY HIDES. IT ONLY HIDES. AND, WHEN SOMEONE OF AUTHORITY BREATHES OXYGEN UNDER THAT ROCK, IT LEGITIMIZES THOSE FOLKS TO COME OUT. COME OUTSIDE OF THE ROCK. I HAD NOT PLANNED ON RUNNING FOR ANYTHING AGAIN AFTER MY SON HAD DIED. AND, I WAS A PROFESSOR IN COLLEGE AND RUNNING ANOTHER PROGRAM AT ANOTHER COLLEGE. UNTIL I SAW THOSE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF CHARLOTTESVILLE CARRYING TORCHES, LITERALLY TORCHES. I SAW THEM ON TELEVISION. THEIR VEINS BULGING. THEIR HATE FILLED SPEECH. TENTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE THAT WAS CHANTED ON THE STREETS OF GERMANY IN THE 1930'S. ON TOP OF THAT, ACCOMPANIED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS, KU KLUX KLAN. A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED PROTESTING THOSE FOLKS. THE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES WAS ASKED WHAT DO YOU THINK? HE SAID, SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID , \"THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES.\" NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THE POINT I AM MAKING IS IT'S NOT ALL HIS FAULT, BUT IT LEGITIMIZES THE DARK SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE. WHAT IT DID THOUGH, IT ALSO EXPOSED WHAT HAVE NOT BEEN PAID ENOUGH ATTENTION TO. THE UNDERLYING RACISM THAT HAS INSTITUTIONALIZED IN THE UNITED STATES, IT STILL EXISTS. IT HAS EXISTED FOR 400 YEARS. SO, WHAT'S HAPPENED IS WE END UP IN A CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE YOU HAD HERE IN KENOSHA AND HAVE HERE IN KENOSHA. BUT, I AM , I HAD A SERIOUS OPERATION YEARS AGO. A NEUROSURGEON GAVE ME A VERY SMALL CHANCE. I SAID I WILL BE FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS, SENATOR? YOU ARE A CONGENITAL OPTIMIST. I THINK WE HAVE REACHED AN INFLECTION POINT IN OUR HISTORY. I HONEST TO GOD BELIEVE WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY. NOW THAT THE CURTAIN HAS BEEN PULLED BACK. TO DO A LOT OF REALLY AMAZING THINGS. PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE BECAUSE OF COVID WHO THE PEOPLE ARE BREAKING THEIR NEXT AND CKS AND RISKING THEIR LIVES. THE DEFINITION OF A FIREFIGHTER , GOD MADE MAN AND THEN MADE A COUPLE OF FIREFIGHTERS. I GREW UP IN A NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU EITHER BECAME A FIREFIGHTER OR A PRIEST. I WAS NOT QUALIFIED FOR EITHER. ALL KIDDING ASIDE, THINK OF WHAT HAPPENED. WHO ARE ALL THOSE PEOPLE? YOU HAVE OVER 6000 YOUNG \"DREAMERS,\" THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY, WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES DEALING WITH COVID. YOU HAVE ALL THOSE FOLKS WORKING IN A SUPERMARKET STOCKING THE SHELVES, MAKING FIVE DOLLARS, SIX DOLLARS, SEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. THEY ARE MOSTLY MINORITIES, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, LATINOS. PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO FIGURE OUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THE FIRST POINT I WANT TO MAKE YOU IS I AM NOT PESSIMISTIC. I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY IF WE SEIZE IT. I WILL RESPOND TO WHAT EACH OF YOU HAD TO SAY. TIM, YOU TALKED ABOUT A LOT MORE ABOUT PUTTING MONEY BEHIND THE SOLUTIONS. THE COUNTRY IS READY TO PUT THE MONEY WE HAD SOLUTIONS NOW. HERE'S WHAT I'M PROPOSING. 30% POVERTY RATE AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS. YOU HAVE LIVING WAGES THAT DON'T EXIST. WE ARE GOING TO NATIONALIZED $15 AN HOUR. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WORK TWO JOBS JUST TO MAKE IT. THAT IS NOT RIGHT IN AMERICA. TWO JOBS JUST TO BE ABOVE THE POVERTY RATE, ABOVE THE POVERTY LEVEL? PRISON REFORM, A LOT OF REFORMS IT TAKES, BUT MY VIEW IS WE SHOULD TAKE PRISON REFORM , I HAVE BEEN PREACHING THIS , FROM PRISON PUNISHMENT TO REFORM. FOR EXAMPLE, ANYONE WHO SERVES TIME IN PRISON AND THEY GET OUT, THEY SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM THAT EXIST. WHY DON'T WE WANT THEM GETTING THE PELL GRANT AND GOING TO SCHOOL? WHY DON'T WE WANT THEM GOING TO SCHOOL AND GETTING PUBLIC HOUSING SUBSIDIES? WHY DON'T WE WANT THEM QUALIFYING FOR WHAT USED TO BE CALLED FOOD STAMPS? RIGHT NOW, YEARS AGO, A SENATOR FROM PENNSYLVANIA, WE WROTE THE SECOND CHANCE ACT. NOW WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU GET OUT OF PRISON , YOU GET A BUS TICKET AND $25. BY THE WAY, 93% OF EVERYBODY , 93 OUT OF 100 PRISONERS IN PRISON ARE BEHIND A CITY JAIL, A COUNTY JAIL, A STATE JAIL, NOT A FEDERAL PRISON. BARACK AND I WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION BY 38,000 FOLKS. ANYONE WHO GETS CONVICTED OF A DRUG CRIME, NOT ONE THAT IS MASSIVE SELLING, BUT CONSUMPTION, THEY SHOULDN'T GO TO PRISON. THEY SHOULD GO TO MANDATORY REHABILITATION. INSTEAD OF BUILDING MORE PRISONS, I HAVE BEEN PROPOSING FOR SOME TIME WE BUILD REHABILITATION CENTERS. MANDATORY. THEY'VE GOT TO GO TO MANDATORY REHAB. BUT, IS NOT PART OF THE RECORD WHEN THEY GET OUT IF THEY FINISH IT. THE POINT YOU MADE, YOU GET A RECORD AND IT STAYS WITH YOU. SORRY, YOU CAN'T GET THE JOB BECAUSE YOU HAD BEEN THE FOLLOWING. EVEN IF IT IS A MISDEMEANOR. WE SHOULD NOT BE PUTTING ANYBODY IN JAIL FOR THAT. WE SHOULD FIND OURSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE HOUSING RIGHT NOW IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WE DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF HOUSING FUNDING WE HAD BACK IN OUR ADMINISTRATION BEFORE THAT, EVEN THE REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HOUSING, INCLUDING PEOPLE ON THE STREET. THAT'S WHY I PROPOSE A $400 BILLION TO MATCH THE INCREASE OF AVAILABLE HOUSING IN AMERICA. BY THE WAY, IT IS NOT A WASTE OF MONEY. EVEN THE FOLKS ON WALL STREET POINT OUT THAT WILL INCREASE THE GDP. MAKE IT GROW. PEOPLE WILL DO BETTER, PEOPLE WILL DO BETTER. HEART AS THE DEVIL FOR AN EVER YOUR CLIENTS WHO ARE BLACK TO GET AN ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESS LOAN. ALL THE STUDIES SHOW THEY ARE JUST AS QUALIFIED TO BE ABLE TO SUCCEED AS ANYBODY ELSE. BARACK AND I PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM, $1.5 BILLION THAT BROUGHT $30 BILLION OFF THE SIDELINES. WE PROVIDE THAT PROGRAM FOR THE LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION SO YOU CAN GO APPLY. GUESS WHAT? IF YOU GET A LOAN AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR SAYS, HEY, HE'S GOT THE GOVERNMENT BACKING HIM, WE WILL JOIN HIM OR HER. WE WILL MOVE THAT TO $150 BILLION TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE WHERE WE GOT. I'M GIVING YOU TOO MUCH. I CAN SEE YOU ARE ABOUT TO STAND UP. [LAUGHTER] MENTAL HEALTH IS A BADLY WE INSISTED IT BE TREATED EQUALLY. NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM AND A PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEM. THEY ARE BOTH RELATED TO YOUR HEALTH. THEY SHOULD BE BOTH COVERED. WE TALKED ABOUT THE WHOLE IDEA OF FEDERAL SUPPORT. WE NEED COMMUNITY CLINICS. YOU GUYS ARE EXPECTED TO DO EVERYTHING. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT , PROTESTING IS PROTESTING. AS MY BUDDY JOHN LEWIS USED TO SAY. NONE OF IT JUSTIFIES LOOTING OR BURNING OR ANYTHING ELSE. THIS CANNOT BE TOLERATED ACROSS THE BOARD. YOU TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF , ONE OF THE THINGS I PROPOSED, TO MAKE SURE PROSECUTORS ARE ABLE TO , IF YOU ARE A WHITE GUY WHO CAN AFFORD A LAWYER AND YOU ARE CHARGED WITH A CRIME, YOU ARE NOT CHARGED WITH NINE CRIMES AND GIVEN NINE ALTERNATIVES. WE WILL PUT YOU ON PROBATION. AND YOU HAVE NO LAWYER. OR YOU HAVE A PUBLIC DEFENDER GETTING PAID HALF. PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE GOING TO GET PAID THE SAME AMOUNT AS PROSECUTORS ARE GOING TO GET PAID. ONCE YOU GET THAT ON YOUR RECORD, YOU HAVE A REAL PROBLEM. TWO PEOPLE SHOW UP FOR A JOB AND YOU HAVE THAT THING YOU PLED TO, RATHER THAN RUN THE RISK OF GOING TO JAIL FOR FIVE YEARS, YOU PLED. THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, WHICH IS NOT MUCH OF A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RIGHT NOW, GO IN AND LOOK AT THE METHODS USED BY PROSECUTORS, HOW THEY DEAL WITH SENTENCING. THERE IS A LOT MORE TO SAY. I HAVE ALREADY SAID TOO MUCH. THERE IS A LOT WE ARE ABLE TO DO . THE PUBLIC IS READY TO DO THESE THINGS, I PROMISE YOU. I PROMISE YOU. LAST PIECE, EDUCATION. THE IDEA IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, YOUR EDUCATION IS DETERMINED BY YOUR ZIP CODE. TITLE I SCHOOLS , THE GAP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THEM AND OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WE MOVE THAT TO $45 BILLION A YEAR. I CAN PUT EVERY THREE-YEAR-OLDS, FOUR-YEAR-OLDS AND FIVE-YEAR-OLD IN SCHOOL. EVERY MAJOR UNIVERSITY IN THE COUNTRY HAS POINTED OUT THAT INCREASES BY 58%, THE CHANCES OF THAT CHILD WILL GET THROUGH ALL 12 YEARS OF SCHOOL. WE HAVE ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST FOR EVERY 1500 KIDS IN AMERICA. WE KNOW NOW THAT ABOUT 60% OF THE CHILD'S BRAID IS DEVELOPED BY THE TIME , BRAIN IS DEVELOPED BY THE TIME THEY REACH THAT AGE. THINGS THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED EARLY CAN BE DEALT WITH. ANXIETY. THEY DO NOT DO IT NOW BECAUSE THEY CANNOT PICK IT UP. WHEN YOU DO THAT, WE KNOW THE MOST AT RISK GENERATION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY IS THE Z-GENERATION. WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED, AND I WILL END WITH THIS , YOU ARE GETTING ANTSY. IT IS IMPORTANT. HERE'S THE DEAL. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT DRUG ABUSE DOES NOT CAUSE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS BECAUSE DRUG ABUSE. IF YOU DO NOT DETECT IT EARLY AND TREATED, YOU INCREASE THE PROSPECT THEY ARE GOING TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY. THERE IS SO MUCH WE CAN DO. SO MUCH WE CAN DO. AND WE CAN DO IT JUST BY ELIMINATING THE TAX CUT FOR THE TOP 1\/10 OF 1%. IT HAS DONE NOTHING TO HELP ANYBODY. 19 CORPORATIONS MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS APIECE DO NOT PLAY , DO NOT PAY A SINGLE PENNY IN TAXES. HERE'S THE DEAL. I CAN PAY FOR EVERY SINGLE THING I AM PROPOSING WITHOUT RAISING YOUR TAXES. IT IS NOT THAT WE CANNOT DO IT. WE HAVE NOT BEEN WILLING TO DO THIS I WILL DO WHATEVER YOU TELL ME, BOSS. WHAT YOU HEARD HERE WAS STRENGTH, EXPERIENCE, AND EMPATHY. WHAT WE DO KNOW, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, YOU AND KAMALA HARRIS HAVE THE LEADERSHIP AND STRENGTH TO RESTORE FAITH AND HEALING IN THIS COUNTRY. WE WILL CONTINUE THE COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS. I AM SURE YOU HAVE MORE TO FEAR FROM OUR COMMUNITY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME FORWARD AND LEAD US IN THE NEXT ROUND OF CONVERSATIONS? THANK YOU. MY NAME IS PORTIA BENNETT. I WAS TOLD TO GO OFF THIS PAPER, BUT I CANNOT. WE NEED THE TRUTH. PART OF THE TRUTH, I WAS BORN HERE, RAISED HERE. I HAVE TO GIVE YOU THE TRUTH OF THE PEOPLE. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS WE ARE HEAVILY ANGRY. NOT ANGRY AS TO WHERE PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE PROTESTING. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PROTESTER AND A RIDER , RIOT ER. PROTESTERS SHOW NOT JUST LACKS , BLACKS ARE TIRED OF WHAT IS GOING ON. WE CAME TOGETHER TO HELP GET THIS COMMUNITY TOGETHER BECAUSE WE LIVE HERE AND WE WANT IT TO STAY THE WAY WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD IT. THE CHANGES WE WANT HAVE TO BE MORE IN EFFECT. WE HAVE HEARD SO MANY PEOPLE SAY, WE WILL GIVE YOU THIS AND WE WILL GIVE YOU THAT. WE HAVE YET TO SEE ACTION. YOU WILL BE LET DOWN EVERY SINGLE TIME. IF I WERE THAT OFFICER, I WOULD BE IN THE KENOSHA COUNTY JAIL RIGHT NOW. ALL OF THESE OFFICERS WHO COMMIT THESE CRIMES, IF A MEDICAL EXAMINER DOES THEIR JOB AND SAYS , RULES IT'S A HOMICIDE, THAT IS MURDER. , RULES IT A HOMICIDE, THAT IS MURDER. WHY ARE THERE MORE POLICE OFFICERS IN THE BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS? WHY ARE WE MORE TARGETED THAN ANYBODY ELSE? WE WALK SOMEWHERE, AND AUTOMATICALLY, YOU FIT THE DESCRIPTION. I AM ONLY 31. I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH WITHIN THESE LAST TWO YEARS TO SAY, I'M TIRED. I AM A MOTHER. MY OLDEST IS 13 AND MY TWINS ARE NINE. I DO THIS BECAUSE I WANT THEIR FUTURE TO BE BETTER THAN WHAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW. MY PRESENT IS NOT GOOD. I WANT THE TRUTH HEARD AND I SPEAK FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY BECAUSE ALL OF US ARE HERE WITH THESE PEOPLE. I AM TELLING THE TRUTH. IT IS NOT WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT IS FOR US. WE WANT THE SAME EXACT RIGHTS AS OTHERS. WE WANT TO BE TREATED JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. A LOT OF US GET DENIED JOBS BECAUSE WE MARK THAT BOX AS BLACK OR AFRICAN-AMERICAN. PEOPLE TEAR DOWN OUR HOUSES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS INSTEAD OF FIXING THEM UP AND MAKING A BETTER. WE ARE PUSHED TO ONE SIDE OF TOWN. GENTRIFICATION HAS TO STOP AS WELL. WE CANNOT GET THERE IF SOMEBODY WITH A VOICE CANNOT PUT THAT INTO EFFECT. THAT IS ALL WE ARE ASKING. WE WANT THE SAME TREATMENT. WE ARE NOT ASKING, PUT US ABOVE ANYBODY. FOR SO MANY DECADES, WE HAVE BEEN SHOWN WE DON'T MATTER. WE WANT SOMEONE WHO IS ACTUALLY GOING TO SHOW AND PUT THEIR ACTION IN PAIRED THERE A LOT OF STUFF WE WANT DONE. , ACTION IN. THERE ARE A LOT OF STUFF WE WANT DONE. I SEE IT, I LIVE IT. OTHERS WHO DON'T SEE IT AND LIVE IT CANNOT TELL YOU THE TRUTH. THEY CANNOT GIVE YOU THE THINGS WE ARE GOING THROUGH AS BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE. SO I AM TELLING YOU. IT IS WAY MORE THAT WE WANT DONE, AND IT DID NOT JUST START WITH JACOB. WE WANT CHANGE. WE WANT CHANGE. THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY AND HEARING ME. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, FOR BEING HERE, LISTENING. THE SPOTLIGHT HAS BEEN ON OUR TOWN. WE TALKED ABOUT SUNDAY, WHAT HAPPENED SUNDAY. I FEEL LIKE THAT WAS YEARS AGO. WHEN I AM WALKING OUT THERE AND TALKING TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND I AM TALKING TO MY NEIGHBORS AND I'M TALKING TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY, I HEAR THEIR PAIN. THE 10TH DISTRICT, THE CITY OF KENOSHA, DID NOT SUFFER THE SAME DESTRUCTION THAT OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY EXPERIENCED. LIKE I SPOKE TO SENATOR BALDWIN, DOES IT HURT IN MY SECTION OF TOWN? THERE IS A PAIN IN MY SECTION OF TOWN. MR. BLAKE WAS SHOT TWO BLOCKS FROM MY HOUSE. WE SPEAK ABOUT HOW WE FEEL, THE DESPAIR, THE ANGER, ALL OF THOSE THINGS. I ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE HUMANITY COMING OUT OF THESE THINGS. WE KNOW THAT SOMEONE CAME HERE TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP. SOMEONE CAME HERE TO SHOW DIVISION. SOMEONE CAME HERE NOT TO HELP US BUT THE PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE FAMILY DECIDED WE ARE NOT GOING TO SHOW THAT PICTURE TO THE WORLD. YOU SAW A BLOCK PARTY HAPPEN RIGHT THERE WHERE MR. BLAKE WAS SHOT. YOU SAW PEOPLE CELEBRATING LIFE. YOU SAW KIDS PLAYING IN BOUNCE HOUSES. USE ALL SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO THE COMMUNITY , YOU SAW SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO THE COMMUNITY. THIS WAS PUT TOGETHER IN 24-HOUR PERIOD. IT HAPPENED ORGANICALLY. THE SPIRIT, THAT IS THE SPIRIT OF KENOSHA, AND THAT IS THE THING THAT GIVES ME HOPE. WHAT GIVES ME HOPE ABOUT YOUR PRESIDENCY, WE CAN STOP TALKING CYNICISM. WHEN WE GO OUT THERE IN THAT MARKETPLACE OF VOTING, WE WILL HAVE A REAL IDEA. WE WILL GIVE PEOPLE , I DO NOT WANT TO USE THE OTHER GUYS PHRASE. WE WILL GIVE THEM HOPE. THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. I AM GOING TO NEED IN MY DISTRICT, IT IS GOING TO BE MORE OF THOSE SOFT SKILLS. JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ALL THE THINGS THE OTHER SPEAKERS HAVE SPOKE ON, THAT WILL HELP IMMENSELY. BUT TO RESTORE FAITH IN THE SYSTEM, THAT WILL BE VERY HARD, VERY DIFFICULT, TO RESTORE FAITH IN THE PROCESS, THAT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT. WHEN WE KNOW THE MAN AT THE TOP IS SPEAKING TRUTH, HONEST TRUTH, YOU WILL MAKE OUR WORK IN KENOSHA A LOT BETTER. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DAY. THANK YOU. I WILL JUST STAY SEATED, MAKE IT INFORMAL. PORTIA, YOU KNOW, THE THINGS I TALKED ABOUT HERE THAT WE HAVE TO DO DID NOT START , GOING BACK TO ERIC GARNER, I CAN'T BREATHE. I HAVE BEEN PROPOSING THESE THINGS FOR A LONG TIME. LITERALLY FOR YEARS. THE ONE THING I THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE, MY MOM USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, YOU WANT TO KNOW ME, COME WALK IN MY SHOES AND MY HOME. EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT SINCE I HAVE BEEN A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS LIKE TO WALK OUT THE DOOR OR SEND MY SON OUT THE DOOR OR DAUGHTER AND WORRY ABOUT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE BLACK, THEY MAY NOT COME BACK. I CANNOT REALLY , I CAN INTELLECTUALLY UNDERSTAND IT. BUT I CANNOT FEEL IT. I JUST SPENT AN HOUR OR MORE WITH THE FAMILY AS I GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH JACOB ON THE PHONE. HE IS OUT OF ICU. WE SPOKE FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. HIS BROTHER AND TWO SISTERS, HIS DAD AND HIS MOM ON THE TELEPHONE. HE TALKED ABOUT HOW NOTHING WAS GOING TO DEFEAT HIM. HOW WHETHER HE WALKED AGAIN OR NOT, HE WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE UP. WE TALKED ABOUT , MAY HE RAISE YOU UP ON EAGLES WINGS AND HOLD YOU IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN. I THINK , THEY UNDERSTAND THAT FEAR DOES NOT SOLVE PROBLEMS. ONLY HOPE DOES. YOU GIVE UP HOPE, YOU MIGHT AS WELL SURRENDER. THERE IS NO REAL OPTION. AS WE TALKED, I LISTENED TO HIS MOM. SHE WAS ON THE PHONE. SHE WAS NOT WITH JACOB. SHE WAS IN THE SAME LOCATION. HIS DAD, HIS SON, HIS BROTHER, TWO SISTERS, AND A FAMILY LAWYER . WHAT I CAME AWAY WITH WAS THE OVERWHELMING SENSE OF RESILIENCE AND OPTIMISM THAT THEY HAD ABOUT THE KIND OF RESPONSE THEY ARE GETTING. HIS MOM , MY WIFE ASKED TO SAY A PRAYER AND HIS MOM SAID A PRAYER AND SHE SAID, I AM PRAYING FOR JACOB AND I'M PRAYING FOR THE PLACEMENT AS WELL , THE POLICEMAN AS WELL. I AM PRAYING THAT THINGS CHANGE. IF YOU THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW, IT HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE WAKE-UP CALL THAT HAS GOTTEN THE REST OF THE NATION TO REALIZE THAT IT IS A CONFLUENCE OF THREE THINGS. THE COVID CRISIS, WE DID NOT HAVE TO HAVE OVER 6 MILLION PEOPLE CONTRACT COVID. IF WE HAD JUST ACTED. IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY THE UNIVERSITY OF COLUMBIA LAW FIRM , LAW SCHOOL, TWO WEEKS EARLIER, 51,000 PEOPLE WOULD BE ALIVE. YOU HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU ARE A LEADER, PRESIDENT. INSTEAD OF SAYING I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE, I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY. I THINK THE COUNTRY IS MUCH MORE PRIME TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOW SEEN WHAT YOU SEE. THEY ARE NOT A BRIGHT YOUNG BLACK WOMAN WITH TWO , THREE CHILDREN THAT YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. THERE ARE CHANGES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT , LOOK, THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT IS REALLY NOT ABOUT ME. IF WE HAVE FOUR MORE YEARS OF THE EXACT SAME THING, ONLY IT WILL IMPACT US FOR A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS. THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THAT NOW. I THINK THEY ARE SO READY TO DO SO MANY THINGS. IT NEVER REGISTERED WITH THEM BEFORE OR THEY JUST HAVE SEEN THINGS THEY HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE. YOU KNOW, WHEN DR. KING, WHEN HE SAID, , TOOK THOSE FIREHOUSES , FIRE HOSES AND DOGS TO BLACK WOMEN HEADING TO CHURCH. HE THOUGHT HE WAS PUTTING A STICK IN THE HEART OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HEARD ABOUT THIS AND THEY TURNED ON THE TV AND THEY SAW IT. DR. KING SAID IT WAS THE SECOND EMANCIPATION. THAT YOUNG MAN STOOD THERE FOR EIGHT MINUTES AND 43 SECONDS WATCHING FLOYD DIE, HAVING HIS FACE PRESSED UP AGAINST THAT CURB, PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD SAID, OH MY GOD, IT REALLY HAPPENS. YOU HAVE A MAN OF HIS SIZE AND PHYSICALITY CALLING FOR HIS MOM, IT STRUCK A NERVE THAT HAD NOT BEEN STRUCK BEFORE. IT IS AWFUL IT HAS TO HAPPEN. WE ARE AT ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS. WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY, IF WE DON'T LET UP, IF WE DON'T LET UP. THERE IS A REASON WHY THIS ADMINISTRATION ONLY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT DIVIDING THE COUNTRY AND ABOUT LAW AND ORDER. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED FROM COVID. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT ALMOST A MILLION PEOPLE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT AND DON'T HAVE JOBS. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES CLOSING, MAYBE FOR GOOD. THEY DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CONGRESS PASSED LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE MONEY FOR STATES TO BE ABLE TO KEEP FIREFIGHTERS ON THE JOB, TEACHERS ON THE JOB, FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE JOB. THEY DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT. THEY DO NOT FEEL LIKE IT IS THEIR OBLIGATION. IF I GET ELECTED PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU THERE WILL BE A NATIONAL COMMISSION ON POLICING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WHERE I WILL BRING EVERYONE TO THE TABLE, INCLUDING POLICE CHIEFS, CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, NAACP, THE LATINO COMMUNITY. WE WILL SIT DOWN THERE AND WORK IT OUT. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE POLICE ARE DECENT PEOPLE. BUT NO ONE, THERE ARE A LOT OF BAD FOLKS IN EVERY ORGANIZATION. THERE IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WILLING TO SPEAK UP NO MATTER WHAT OUTFIT YOU WORK WITH. WE HAVE TO GIVE A CHANCE TO CHANGE THINGS. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SOLITARY REASON IN THE WORLD WHY WE SHOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION THAT EVERYBODY , I ASKED MY WIFE JILL , WE'RE IN A SITUATION NOW WHERE WE CANNOT LET UP. WE CANNOT LET UP. VIOLENCE OF ANY FORM IS WRONG. THE IDEA THAT THIS PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO TRY TO DIVIDE US, TALKS ABOUT HOW THERE IS REALLY GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES, TALKS IN WAYS THAT ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY , NOT ONLY INCORRECT BUT IMMORAL. SIMPLY WRONG. SIMPLY WRONG. THE ONE CONCERN, AND I UNDERSTAND IT, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SO FRUSTRATED AND SAY IT IS NOT WORTH IT AT ALL, I AM NOT GOING TO VOTE. A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, I TALKED TO HIM BEFORE HE DIED, JOHN LEWIS. AS JOHN SAID, THE ONLY ANSWER IS TO VOTE. IT IS THE ONLY ANSWER. OTHERWISE, NOTHING ELSE WORKS IN DEMOCRACY. THE NOT SO GOOD GUYS WIN. I UNDERSTAND, I REALLY DO HAVE A SENSE OF THE FRUSTRATION. WHERE I AM, I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE , WHEN THE UNITED STATES, WHEN AMERICA SETS ITS MIND TO SOMETHING, IT HAS NEVER, NEVER, NEVER FAILED. AND WE DO IT TOGETHER. NEVER. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH WARS AND PESTILENCE, PLAGUE, WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A LOT. WE ARE FINALLY NOW GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE WILL BE ADDRESSING ORIGINAL SIN IN THIS COUNTRY. 400 YEARS OLD, IT IS THE ORIGINAL SENT, SLAVERY. , ORIGINAL SIN, SLAVERY, AND ALL OF THE VESTIGES OF IT. I AM NOT SAYING IN FOUR YEARS , I CANNOT GUARANTEE EVERYTHING GET SOLVED IN FOUR YEARS AND I GUARANTEE YOU ONE THING, IT WILL BE A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT BETTER. WE WILL MOVE A LOT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. PEOPLE FEAR THAT WHICH IS DIFFERENT. WHY IN GOD'S NAME DON'T WE TEACH HISTORY AND HISTORY CLASSES? , IN HISTORY CLASSES? A BLACK GUY INVENTED THE LIGHT BULB, NOT A WHITE GUY NAMED THOMAS EDISON. BLACK WALL STREET IN OKLAHOMA WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND. WE DON'T TEACH THEM. WE HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE FACTS. TEACH THEM WHAT IS OUT THERE. THE IDEA , I JUST SPENT TIME WITH A NUMBER OF NFL PLAYERS , EXCUSE ME, BASKETBALL PLAYERS, INCLUDING STEPH CURRY. THESE FOLKS ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE. IT IS NOT ABOUT FAME OR GLORY. THEY HAVE BROTHERS, FATHERS WHO HAVE BEEN BEAT UP, WHO HAVE BEEN BRUTALIZED JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THEY ARE SAYING, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I THINK THERE IS A CHANCE FOR A REAL AWAKENING HERE. THE POINT IS, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY ALTERNATIVE. BUT TO FIGHT. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY ALTERNATIVE BUT TO FIGHT BACK. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH. THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES WITH HIS LAW AND ORDER STRIDES. BOY, AFTER HIS CONVENTION, WE REALLY MADEHE HAS NOT. NOT AT ALL. THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY AIN'T BUYING IT. ALL OF THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING SPENT, THEY ARE NOT BUYING IT. BUT WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE THAN THEM NOT BY IT. WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH THEM AND SAY YOU HAVE GOT TO STEP UP. YOU HAVE GOT TO STEP UP. YOU HAVE GOT TO DO A LOT MORE. A LOT MORE. AND WE , THAN YOU HAVE DONE BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST CHANCE WE HAVE HAD IN A GENERATION IN MY VIEW TO DEAL AND CUT AND OTHER SLICE OFF INSTITUTIONAL RACISM TOWARD GETTING TO A PLACE WHERE IT CHANGES. THE MAIN REASON WHY I AM OPTIMISTIC, BECAUSE YOUR GENERATION, BLACK, WHITE, ASIAN AMERICAN, DID YOU EVER THINK YOU WOULD TURN ON A TV , YOU ARE MUCH LET , MUCH YOUNGER THAN I AM, BUT DID YOU EVER THINK YOU WOULD TURN ON A TV AND ONE TO THREE ADS WOULD BE BIRACIAL COUPLES SELLING A PRODUCT? THAT NEVER WOULD'VE HAPPENED IN THE 1950'S, 1960'S. THIS GENERATION IS A DIFFERENT GENERATION. THEY ARE THE LEAST PREJUDICED, THE MOST OPTIMISTIC, THE BEST EDUCATED, THE MOST DESIRABLE OF CHANGE OF ANY GENERATION. WE CANNOT LET THEM DOWN. THOSE OF US WHO ARE A LOT OLDER, WE HAVE GOT TO JOIN THEM AND DO IT NOW. AGAIN, I THANK YOU. AS I SAID, I REALLY AM OPTIMISTIC. I PROMISE YOU, WIN OR LOSE, I'M GOING TO GO DOWN FIGHTING. I'M GOING TO GO DOWN FIGHTING FOR RACIAL EQUALITY, EQUITY ACROSS THE BOARD. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR. THAT MAY BE BUT YOUR BIRTHRIGHT , BE WHAT YOUR BIRTHRIGHT WAS, BUT IT IS DIFFERENT ACTUALLY BEING TREATY EQUALLY. BEING TREATED THE SAME. EVERYTHING FROM BLACK MORTALITY RATES IN PREGNANCY STRAIGHT THROUGH TO EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. BUT THE COUNTRY IS READY. IF THEY ARE NOT, IT IS NOT READY BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS I AM NOT GOING TO CHANGE. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WORTH LOSING OVER. THIS IS SOMETHING WORTH LOSING OVER. WHAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] THOSE WERE TRULY UNIFYING WORDS IN A COMMUNITY THAT NEEDS HEALING, UNIFICATION. WE WILL GO DOWN FIGHTING WITH YOU. WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT GOING DOWN. LET ME SAY ONE THING IF I COULD. THE GENTLEMAN IN ME WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT WELCOME THE DR. JILL BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] PLEASE WELCOME DR. JILL BIDEN. THANK YOU. WELCOME TO KENOSHA. PATRICK, PLEASE COME FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. BIDEN FOR COMING OUT. THANK YOU, PASTOR BARKER FOR HOLDING THIS GREAT COMMUNITY EVENT, THIS TOWN HALL MEETING. THANK YOU TO ALL THE SPEAKERS THAT CAME FORWARD. I WANT TO THANK YOU, MR. BIDEN, FOR REMINDING US HOW IMPORTANT OPTIMISM IS. WE DEAL WITH SO MUCH NEGATIVITY. WE DEAL WITH SO MANY PROBLEMS. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON BEING POSITIVE AND DEALING WITH A SOLUTION. LIKE I SAID, SO MUCH HAS BEEN SAID. I AM THANKFUL , GRATEFUL TO EVEN BE INVITED TO THIS. LET'S STAND AS WE GET READY TO DISMISS AND PRAY, FATHER, WE THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN, I THANK YOU FOR YOUR GRACE AND YOUR MERCY. YOUR GOODNESS AND YOUR KINDNESS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO COME TOGETHER IN THE SPIRIT OF ONENESS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING MR. BIDEN TO TAKE TIME OUT OF HIS BUSY SCHEDULE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO BRING SOME ISSUES TO THE TABLE. FATHER, I PRAY RIGHT NOW THAT YOU TAKE OUR HATRED, THAT YOU MOVE OUR HATRED FROM OUR COMMUNITY AND REPLACE IT WITH LOVE. I PRAY SINCERELY AND SERIOUSLY, DEAR GOD, THAT YOU REMIND US EACH AND EVERY DAY THAT WE CAN BE RESILIENT AND HAVE TENACITY AND MOVE FORWARD AWAY FROM THIS DESTRUCTION. I PRAY THAT YOU ALLOW THIS COMMUNITY TO HEAL, KENOSHA. I PRAY THAT YOU BLESS AND OSHA, THAT YOU BRING US BACK TOGETHER, THAT YOU TEAR DOWN THE WALLS THAT SEPARATE US BECAUSE OF RACE AND OTHER ISSUES. I PRAY THAT YOU OPEN UP THE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION THAT MUCH MORE BETWEEN YOUR PEOPLE. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST STARTED RECENTLY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE. WE PRAY THAT YOU ONCE AGAIN CONTINUE TO PROTECT KENOSHA. CONTINUE TO PROTECT WISCONSIN. CONTINUE TO PROTECT THIS COUNTRY AND ALSO CONTINUE TO PROTECT THIS WORLD. WE LIFT UP THE BLAKE FAMILY TODAY. WE PRAY THAT TOUCHED HIM MIRACULOUSLY. WE PRAY DEAR GOD FOR HIS FAMILY AS THEY GO THROUGH THIS HEALING PROCESS, AS THEY DEAL WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS IN THE MEDIA AND THE SITUATIONS WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. I WILL NOT STOP THERE. I WILL PRAY AND ASK THAT YOU TOUCH THE KENOSHA POLICE DEPARTMENT. SO THEY ARE DOING A GREAT JOB THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS COMMUNITY. I PRAY THAT YOU TOUCH THE HEARTS OF THOSE THAT THEY ALLOW RACISM AND BIGOTRY AND HATRED TO COME IN. WE KNOW THAT SOME OF IT IS LEARNED BEHAVIOR. IT IS UNFORTUNATE. WE PRAY THAT YOU ALLOW THIS COMMUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER AS SO MANY HAVE SAID, WE NEED TO REBUILD. WE NEED TO RECONSTRUCT. I PRAY THAT WE RELY ON YOU AS OUR ULTIMATE SORTURCE OF STRENGTH. AS WE GET READY TO LEAVE THIS PLACE, ONLY DISMISSALS FROM THIS PLACE, BUT NEVER IN YOUR PRESENCE. RESIDE IN EACH OF OUR HEARTS TODAY AND FOREVER MORE. WE GIVE YOU ALL THE PRAISE, THE OWNER AND THE GLORY THAT YOU SO RIGHTFULLY DESERVE AND MUCH MORE. I PRAY AS NONE OTHER THAN A SERVANT WHO STANDS BEHIND THE CROSS AND I PRAY, DEAR GOD, I NEED THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, MY LORD AND MY SAVIOR. AND LET EVERYONE SAY AMEN. THANK YOU. THIS CONCLUDES THE PROGRAM. WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT EVERYONE, PLEASE STAY WHERE YOU ARE. STAGE STAFF WILL TAKE OVER. WE WILL TAKE A PHOTO AND THEY WILL DIRECT TRAFFIC. BEFORE WE BEGIN THAT PROCESS, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK PASTOR BARKER FOR HOSTING US TODAY AND DR. JILL BIDEN AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN FOR BEING HERE TODAY. WE WISH YOU WELL. WE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UNIFYING FORCE TO KENOSHA. THIS IS A COMMUNITY OF IMMIGRANTS, BLACKS AND LATINOS, GERMANS, POLISH, ITALIANS. WE WORK TOGETHER. WE ARE HURTING RIGHT NOW. WE KNOW OUR CHALLENGE IS TO DIG DEEP IN OUR INNER SOUL, TO HEAL OUR OWN COMMUNITY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THE UNIT SHIP OF SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS TO RESTORE FAITH IN THIS COMMUNITY AND THIS COUNTRY. GOD BLESS YOU. [APPLAUSE] WERE GOING TO ASK THAT YOU COME UP , WE ARE GOING TO ASK THAT YOU COME UP ONE AT A TIME. EVEN EASIER. I LOVE THAT. YOU SHOULD STAY RIGHT HERE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EVERYONE TURN AROUND.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?475401-1\/joe-biden-delivers-remarks-kenosha-wisconsin","Summary":"2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, where Jacob Blake, an unarmed Black man, was shot by police in August. They gathered with community officials and activists at the Grace Lutheran Church in Kenosha, where Mr. Biden listened to a variety of people from the community talk about their concerns regarding systemic racism, policing policy, and concerns of residents and business owners in the wake of more than a week of protests that followed the shooting of Mr. Blake. The Bidens' visit to Wisconsin included a private meeting with Mr. Blake&rsquo;s family, which was held before the community event at the Kenosha church.","Source":"475401-1","Type":"Speech"}

YOUR EARLY VOTING DATES ARE OCTOBER 15 TO OCTOBER 31 AND YOUR MAIL-IN BALLOTS MUST BE POSTMARKED BY NOVEMBER 3. GOOD AFTERNOON, FOLKS. SORRY I AM A LITTLE LATE. I WAS MESMERIZED. I WAS WALKING OUT OF THE OFFICE LISTENING TO AN INTERVIEW OF FORMER GENERAL MCCAFFREY AND BILL COHEN, FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. I WANT TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT. THE REVELATIONS ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DISREGARD FOR OUR MILITARY AND OUR VETERANS. QUITE FRANKLY, IF WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE ATLANTIC IS TRUE, IT IS DISGUSTING. IT AFFIRMS WHAT MOST OF US BELIEVE TO BE TRUE, THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT FIT TO BE THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. THE PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY SAID, AND I EMPHASIZE, THAT THOSE WHO SIGNED UP TO SERVE INSTEAD OF DOING SOMETHING MORE LUCRATIVE ARE SUCKERS. LET ME BE REALLY CLEAR. WHEN MY SON WAS AN U.S. ATTORNEY AND HE VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO KOSOVO WHILE THE WAR WAS GOING ON AS A CIVILIAN, HE WAS NOT A SUCKER. WHEN MY SON VOLUNTEERED AND JOINED THE UNITED STATES MILITARY AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND WENT TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR AND WON ANOTHER BROWN STORE ACCOMMODATION, HE WAS NOT A SUCKER. THE SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN HE SERVED WITH, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO DID NOT COME HOME, WERE NOT LOSERS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE NOT TRUE. THE PRESIDENT SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO EVERY GOLDSTAR MOTHER AND FATHER AND EVERY BLUE STAR FAMILY THAT HE HAS DENIGRATED AND INSULTED. WHO THE HECK DOES HE THINK HE IS? IS IT TRUE? WE HAVE HEARD FROM HIS OWN MOUTH HIS CHARACTERIZATIONS OF JOHN MCCAIN AS A LOSER IN 2015. DONALD TRUMP SAID HE WAS NOT A WAR HERO, I LIKE PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT CAPTURED. WELL, GOOD FOR HIM. AND HIS DISMISSAL FOR THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SUFFERED BY TROOPS SERVING IN IRAQ AS MERE HEADACHES NOT LONG AGO, HE STOOD BY FAILING TO TAKE ACTION OR EVEN RAISE THE ISSUE WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN WHILE THE KREMLIN PUTS BOUNTIES ON THE HEADS OF AMERICAN TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN. IT IS A SACRED DUTY AND YOU ARE TIRED OF HEARING ME SAY THIS, I WILL GET IN TROUBLE FOR SAYING IT, BUT I WILL SAY IT AGAIN. WE HAVE MANY OBLIGATIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE ONLY ONE TRULY SACRED OBLIGATION. TO SUPPORT THOSE WE SEND INTO HARM'S WAY, CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES WHILE THEY ARE GONE AND CARE FOR THEM WHEN THEY ARE HOME. THAT IS THE ONLY TRULY SACRED OBLIGATION THE GOVERNMENT HAS. DUTY, HONOR, COUNTRY. THESE ARE VALUES THAT DRIVE OUR SERVICE MEMBERS. IT IS AN ALL VOLUNTARY OUTFIT. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DEMONSTRATED HE HAS NO SENSE OF SERVICE, NO LOYALTY TO ANY CAUSE OTHER THAN HIMSELF. IF I AM HONORED OF BEING THE NEXT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, I WILL ENSURE THAT OUR AMERICAN HEROES KNOW I WILL HAVE THEIR BACKS, HONOR THEIR SACRIFICE, AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED WOULD BE IN MILITARY PARADES. I AM ALWAYS CAUTIONED NOT TO LOSE MY TEMPER. THIS MAY BE AS CLOSE AS I CAN COME. JUST A MARKER OF HOW DEEPLY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I DISAGREE ABOUT THE ROLE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. YOU KNOW, THE JOBS REPORT CAME UP THIS MORNING. I AM GRATEFUL FOR EVERYONE WHO FOUND WORK AGAIN, FOUND A GLIMMER OF HOPE. BUT THERE IS REAL CAUSE FOR CONCERN, AS WELL. THE PACE OF THE JOB GAINS IN AUGUST WAS SLOWER THAN JULY AND MAY AND JUNE. MORE AND MORE TEMPORARY LAYOFFS ARE TURNING INTO PERMANENT LAYOFFS. 28 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. AFTER SIX MONTHS IN A PANDEMIC, WE ARE THAN HALFWAY BACK TO WHERE WE WERE, WITH 11.5 MILLION AMERICANS NOT GETTING THEIR JOBS BACK. WE ARE STILL DOWN 720,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS. IN FACT, DONALD TRUMP MAY BE THE ONLY PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS THAN WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE. I SPOKE TO A LOT OF REAL WORKING PEOPLE, ASKED THEM IF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND, HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE ECONOMY COMING BACK. YOU WILL FIND, THEY DON'T FEEL IT. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE TODAY, TO THANK PAUL C. AND HIS TEAM FOR HOSTING US HERE IN WILMINGTON. PAUL, YOUR CONTINUED TRADITION OF DOING GOD'S WORK IN THIS COMMUNITY IS IMPORTANT. HE'S BEEN AROUND FOR , IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR MORE THAN 130 YEARS. THROUGH PANDEMICS, WARS, DEPRESSIONS. WEST END HAS BEEN HERE FOR GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE JUST LOOKING FOR A CHANCE, NOT A HANDOUT. JUST A FAIR SHOT AT A GOOD JOB, A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE, AND A BETTER LIFE TO PASS DOWN TO THEIR KIDS. THERE IS A SPECIAL PLACE , THIS IS A SPECIAL PLACE FOR THE BIDEN FAMILY. MY DAUGHTER WAS A CASEWORKER HERE, HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE AGING OUT OF FOSTER CARE. WHEN I WAS SENATOR AND VICE PRESIDENT, PLENTY OF ECONOMISTS AROUND ME, I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT , THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH THE DOORS HERE. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? ARE THEY OK? IF THEY WEREN'T OK, WE WERE NOT DOING WELL. THAT IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT THIS LATEST JOBS REPORT. THIS REINFORCES THE WORST YEARS OF PAINFUL TRUCE. THE ECONOMIC INEQUITY THAT BEGAN BEFORE THE DOWNTURN HAVE ONLY WORSENED DURING THIS PRESIDENCY. NO ONE THOUGHT THEY WOULD LOSE A JOB FOR GOOD OR SEE SMALL BUSINESSES SHUT DOWN. BUT THAT KIND OF RECOVERY REQUIRES LEADERSHIP. LEADERSHIP WE DID NOT HAVE AND STILL DO NOT HAVE. AS A RESULT, ECONOMISTS ARE STARTING TO CALL THIS RECESSION A K-SHAPED RECESSION, WHICH IS A FANCY PHRASE FOR WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYTHING ABOUT TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. THE K MEANS THOSE AT THE TOP DON'T SEE THINGS GO UP. THOSE IN THE MIDDLE AND THE LOWER AND SEE THINGS GO DOWN AND GETTING WORSE. , END SEE THINGS GO DOWN AND GETTING WORSE. DONALD TRUMP HAS MISMANAGED THE GLOBAL CRISIS, AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS A K-SHAPED PANDEMIC. FIRST, THE PRESIDENT'S CHAOTIC MISMANAGEMENT OF THE PANDEMIC IS STILL HOLDING US BACK, COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES, LIKE EUROPE AND ASIA. ARE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS STILL MORE THAN DOUBLE OTHER NATIONS. WHY? BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS BOTCHED THE COVID RESPONSE. BOTCHED IT BADLY. WE CAN'T DEAL WITH AN ECONOMIC CRISIS UNTIL YOU BEAT THE PANDEMIC. YOU CAN'T HAVE AN ECONOMIC COMEBACK WHEN ALMOST 1000 AMERICANS DIE EACH DAY FROM COVID. WHEN THE DEATH TOLL REACHED 200,000. MORE THAN 6 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN INFECTED. WHEN MILLIONS MORE WORRY ABOUT GETTING SICK AND DYING, IN SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES TRYING TO REOPEN. , AS SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES TRY TO REOPEN. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD TO BEGIN WITH IF THE PRESIDENT JUST DID HIS JOB. IF HE JUST AT THE VIRUS SERIOUSLY EARLY ON AS IT SPREAD AROUND THE GLOBE, IF HE JUST TOOK THE STEPS WHEN NEEDED BACK IN MARCH AND APRIL TO DO WIDESPREAD TESTING AND TESTING TO CONTROL THE VIRUS , AND TRACING TO CONTROL THE VIRUS, IF HE JUST SET A GOOD EXAMPLE, LIKE SOCIAL DISTANCING AND WEARING A MASK, IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK. IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE DOESN'T CARE, IT DOESN'T AFFECT HIM, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T AFFECT HIM FOR HIS CLASS OF FRIENDS. ANYONE WITH A BIG ENOUGH CHECK BOOK CAN GET RAPID TESTS ON DEMAND. IF YOU DON'T, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE FOR HOURS AND WAIT FOR WEEKS TO GET YOUR RESULT, IF YOU GET THE METAL. , THEM AT ALL. IF YOU HAVE THE KIND OF JOB OR YOU CAN WORK FROM A LAPTOP AT HOME REMOTELY, RISKING GETTING COVID IS VERY SMALL WORK. THIS JOB REPORTS SHOWS THAT 37 MILLION PEOPLE REPORTED TELEWORKING. IF YOU WORK AT AN ASSEMBLY LINE OR CHECKOUT COUNTER, MEET WRECKING PLANT, YOU DRIVE A TRUCK , MEATPACKING PLANT, YOU DRIVE A TRUCK, THERE ARE MUCH BIGGER RISKS. THE JOBS REPORT SHOWS MORE THAN 27 MILLION WORKERS REPORTED TODAY COULD NOT WORK OR LOST HOURS BECAUSE THEIR EMPLOYER HAD TO CLOSE OR LOSS BUSINESS DURING THE PANDEMIC. YOU CAN HIRE A PRIVATE TUTOR OR HAVE A LIVE IN CHILDCARE. YOU CAN BALANCE BEING A PARENT AND REMOTE SCHOOLING. IF YOU CAN'T, YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR JOB AND BE A TEACHER ALL AT ONCE. WE HELD A MEETING ASKING THE QUESTIONS THAT PARENTS CALL US WITH, AS WELL . WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO WITH HER CHILDREN? WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE IT SO HARD FOR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN SAFELY. WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE WHEN IT IS DEVASTATING TO KEEP THEM ISOLATED FROM THEIR FRIENDS AND SUPPORT SYSTEM? I ALSO SAID EARLIER THIS WEEK, TO THE SHOCK OF MANY, WE LOST MORE COPS THIS YEAR TO COVID THAN ON PATROL. JUST A REMINDER HOW AN ALREADY DANGEROUS JOB, LAW ENFORCEMENT, HAS GOTTEN MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S MISMANAGEMENT. WHAT MAY BE JUST AS SHOCKING AS MANY OTHER JOBS ALSO BECOME DANGEROUS DUE TO COVID. BEING A HEALTH CARE WORKER IS NOW MORE DANGEROUS THAN EVER. WE HAVE LOST HUNDREDS OF THEM THIS YEAR BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT PROTECTED FROM COVERT ON-THE-JOB. BEING AMY ACKER IS MORE DANGEROUS , THEY WERE NOT PROTECTED FROM COVID ON THE JOB. BEING A MEATPACKER IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN EVER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS OR WHAT HE CLAIMS, YOU ARE NOT SAFER IN DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA. YOU ARE NOT SAFE IN DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA, WHERE PEOPLE ARE DYING AT A RATE LAST SEEN WHEN AMERICANS WERE FIGHTING IN WORLD WAR II. DONALD TRUMP SMACK PRACTICE HAS MADE BEING AN AMERICAN , MALPRACTICE HAS MADE BEING AN AMERICAN LIFE OR DEATH WORK. OPIOD DEATHS WERE UP DURING THE PANDEMIC. ANOTHER CRISIS THAT TRUMP CONTINUES TO ALL BUT IGNORE. IN THE MEANTIME, TRUMP AND HIS FRIENDS HAVE STRONG VIEWS ABOUT WHAT THE REST OF AMERICA SHOULD DO. \"CUT UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO FORCE PEOPLE TO GO BACK TO THEIR JOBS.\" \"DEFUND SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE LIMITED OBAMACARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC.\" \"REOPEN PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITHOUT RESOURCES OR GUIDANCE.\" \"REOPEN MAIN STREET BUSINESSES FOR , \"REOPEN MAIN STREET BUSINESSES WITHOUT PROTECTIONS FOR WORK.\" THIS IS THE PLAN. THE ECONOMIC PAIN REMAINS UNRELENTING TO MILLIONS OF WORKING PEOPLE. MEANWHILE, THEY ARE DOING JUST FINE. SOME BETTER THAN EVER. THE PAINFUL TRUTH IS, WE JUST HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO JUST DOES NOT SEE IT. HE DOES NOT FEEL IT. HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND. HE JUST DOESN'T GET IT. HE THINKS THAT THE STOCK MARKET IS UP AND EVERYTHING IS FINE. AND HIS WEALTHY FRIENDS AND DONORS ARE DOING WELL AND EVERYTHING IS DOING WELL. IF CORPORATIONS EITHER VALUATIONS RISING, THEN THEY MUST BE HIRING , SEE THEIR VALUATIONS RISING, THEN THEY MUST BE HIRING. A MEASURE OF OUR ECONOMIC SUCCESS IS THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND IF YOUR STOCK SOARS AND THERE ARE FAMILIES ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS AND THE PRESIDENT CALLED THAT SUCCESS, WHEN YOU SEE THE WORLD AS SUCH A NARROW PRISM, IT'S NO WONDER HE DOESN'T SEE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ON UNEMPLOYMENT, ONE OUT OF SIX SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSED RIGHT NOW. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT LIFE IS LIKE FOR PEOPLE WALKING BY THEIR BOARDED-UP SHOPS. EDUCATORS AFRAID OF DOING THEIR JOB, TO JOB THEY LOVE , THAT THE JOB THEY LEVEL BRING THE VIRUS TO THE PEOPLE AT HOME THAT THEY LOVE. IT'S NO WONDER HE DOESN'T SEE THE SINGLE MOM FORCED TO WAIT IN A THREE-HOUR FOOD LINE. SO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE, SHE CAN FEED HER FAMILY BECAUSE SHE IS NOT PART OF THE ONE IN SIX HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN THAT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT. HE WANTS US TO BELIEVE WE ARE DOING BETTER. HE WANTS US TO NOT NOTICE THAT THIS REMAINS THE WORST ECONOMIC SITUATION IS THE GREAT DEPRESSION. AND OUR COUNTRY FACES HISTORIC DIVERSIONS IN OUR WAY OF LIFE. WHICH GETS ME TO MY THIRD AND FINAL POINT, WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND. ALL PAIN AND SUFFERING STEMS FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FAILURE TO LEAD. HIS SHEER IN ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. HE LIKES TO SENATE THICKET OF ORDERS , HE LIKES TO SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS FOR PHOTO OPS, HE SAYS PROTECTING RENTERS FROM EVICTION, THAT'S WHAT IS DOING, BUT HE IS NOT GIVING THEM ANY SUPPORT TO PAY THE RENT WHEN IT COMES TO. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL BE LEFT WITH A TERRIBLE CHOICE BETWEEN EVICTION AND LIVING IN THE STREETS OR PAYING BACK RENT THEY SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE. ONE THERE WAS AN ANSWER OFFERED AND REJECTED. , WHEN THERE WAS AN ANSWER OFFERED AND REJECTED. HE SHOULD BE DOING HIS JOB OF CALLING CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS TOGETHER IMMEDIATELY TO GET A DEAL AND DELIVER REAL RESULTS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS I HAVE NEVER SEEN HAS CALLED CONGRESS INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. GET IT DONE LIKE PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS. RENTALS, FOOD, UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE, STUDENT LOAN RELEASE, SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT, EIGHT SCHOOLS AND STATE GOVERNMENTS GOING BANKRUPT. , AID SCHOOLS AND STATE GOVERNMENTS GOING BANKRUPT. AS LONG AS A PANDEMIC AND THE ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE PERSISTS, NO ONE SHOULD HAVE THEIR WATER AND LIGHT CUT OFF BECAUSE THEY CANNOT PAY THE BILL. BOTTOM LINE, MR. PRESIDENT, DO YOUR JOB. GET OFF , GET THE LEADERS INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. MAKE A DEAL THAT THE LEVERS FOR WORKING AMERICANS. THAT EASES THEIR ANXIETY AND PAIN. INJ, OVER THE NEXT THREE WEEKS, I WILL BE LAYING OUT IN SHARP CONTRAST MY PLAN. I WILL BE ASKING AMERICAN PEOPLE THREE BASIC QUESTIONS , WHO CAN HANDLE THE PANDEMIC? WHO CAN KEEP THEIR PROMISES? AND WHO CARES ABOUT AND WILL FIGHT FOR WORKING FAMILIES? LIKE THE PEOPLE HERE IN WEST END, THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC, THEY FOUND A WAY TO KEEP THE CENTER OPEN SAFELY AND PROVIDE THE CRITICAL SERVICES. NO ONE HERE HAS BEEN LAID OFF. THEY ADJUSTED THEIR SPACES FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING. THEY STARTED HELPING LOCAL BUSINESSES, HAIR SALONS, OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES. THEY CONTINUED THEIR CHILDCARE SERVICES, CRITICAL FOR SO MANY WORKING FAMILIES. BY PURE COURAGE, HEART, AND GRIT, THEY NEVER GIVE UP AND HE NEVER GIVEN , AND THEY NEVER GIVE IN. THAT IS THE STORY OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY AND THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS WHO WE ARE. GIVE ORDINARY AMERICANS JUST HALF THE CHANCE, AND THEY NEVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN, THEY WILL DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. THEY WILL NEVER LET US DOWN, UNLIKE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT. AND UNLIKE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT, I WON'T LET YOU DOWN, EITHER. THIS IS WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT. HELPING PEOPLE UNITE. GET TOGETHER. MOVE THIS COUNTRY BACK IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE CAN BE. THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. . NOTHING. IF WE JUST DO IT TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL. I WILL NOW TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. I GUESS, ARE YOU CALLING ON PEOPLE? I DON'T HAVE A LIST. THANK YOU, SIR. THIS MORNING, AND REFERENCE TO THE ARTICLE IN THE ATLANTIC , IN REFERENCE TO THE ARTICLE IN THE ATLANTIC, THE COMMENTS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A TESTAMENT TO SELFISHNESS AND THAT HIS SOUL IS THAT OF A COWARD. YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS AS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF HOW YOU SEE THE JOB AS A PRESENT PRESIDENT, , AS A PRESIDENT. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SOUL AND LIFE HE LEADS? JOE BIDEN: I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE MEASURED IN MY RESPONSE. IF IT IS TRUE, I BELIEVE THE ARTICLE IS TRUE, I WOULD ASK YOU ALL A RHETORICAL QUESTION. HOW DO YOU FEEL? HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU HAD A KID IN AFGHANISTAN RIGHT NOW? HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU LOST A SON OR DAUGHTER OR HUSBAND OR WIFE? HOW WOULD YOU FEEL? THE REAL? I KNOW THAT IT UP TO EXPRESS THIS, BUT YOU KNOW , I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT YOUR JOB TO EXPRESS THIS, BUT YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW IN YOUR GUT IT IS DEPLORABLE. IT'S DEPLORABLE. AS I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES AND I WILL SAY AGAIN, THESE FOLKS ARE THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA. THEY ARE THE HEART, THE SOUL, THE GRIT. THAT IS WHAT PATRIOTISM IS ABOUT. I'VE JUST NEVER BEEN AS DISAPPOINTED IN MY WHOLE CAREER WITH A LEADER I HAVE WORKED WITH, PRESIDENT OR OTHERWISE. BECAUSE IF THE ARTICLE IS TRUE AND IT APPEARS TO BE BASED ON WHAT HE SAID, IT IS ABSOLUTELY DAMNABLE. IT IS A DISGRACE. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE SUPPORTERS OF THE Q1 , QANON, THAT THERE IS SEX TRAFFICKING, CONSPIRACIES AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR NOT REJECTING THE CONSPIRACY AND THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN IT? JOE BIDEN: I'VE BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF MENTAL HEALTH AND RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE IT STILL EXISTS IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IT'S BIZARRE. TOTALLY BIZARRE. AND NOW, HAVE YOU GUYS FOUND THAT PLANELOAD OF PEOPLE IN UNIFORMS FLYING AROUND? HAVE YOU FOUND THEM YET? BY THE WAY, I RESPECT CONSERVATIVE AND LIBERAL POINT OF VIEW WHEN THE PRESS. ANYBODY FOUND THAT PLANE? WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE WE DOING? LOOK AT HOW IT MAKES US LOOK AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS MORTIFYING. IT IS EMBARRASSING. AND IT IS DANGEROUS. IT IS DANGEROUS. IF THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T KNOW BETTER, WHICH HE HAS TO KNOW BETTER, AND MY LORD, WE ARE IN MORE TROUBLE THAN I EVER FELT WE WERE, IT'S BIZARRE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A CASE WHERE I HAVE BEEN PLEASED, BUT SURPRISED WITH BOTH SIDES' ARGUMENTS. THIS CAN'T GO ON. THIS CANNOT GO ON. IT'S A DECONSTRUCTION OF A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THEY KNOW IT. SO, I JUST , I WILL CONCLUDE WITH WHAT YOU HEARD ME SAY MANY TIMES BEFORE, THE WORDS OF A PRESIDENT MATTER. EVEN A LOUSY PRESIDENT. IT GIVES SUCCOR, IT GIVES ENCOURAGEMENT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE STARTING IRRATIONAL VIEWS THAT NO ONE HAS EVEN CLOSE TO EVER PRESUMING OR SHOWING EVER EXISTING. , EVER EXISTED. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, HE'S UNDERSTOOD THE ONLY WAY HE CAN WIN THE FIRST TIME AND THIS TIME IS IF HE FUNDAMENTALLY DIVIDES THE NATION. PUTS THE NATION SO THAT WE ARE AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. LAST MET, PRESIDENT TRUMP , LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THIS IS A SIGN YOU HAVE \"B IG ISSUES\" DESPITE THE CDC SAYING WEAR A MASK SAVE LIVES. , JOE BIDEN: I WEAR THIS BECAUSE I AM A SMART FELLOW. I LISTEN TO SCIENCE. THIS IS NOT A GAME. LIFE AND DEATH, LIFE AND DEATH. THE REPORTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE, AS MANY AS 100,000 DEAD MORE BY THE END OF THE YEAR , THERE ARE REPORTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AS MANY AS 100,000 DEAD MORE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT'S HARD TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING SO IDIOTIC. HAVE YOU BEEN TESTED NOW FOR COVID-19? JOE BIDEN: YES, I HAVE. I HAVE BEEN TESTED ONCE WITH A DEEP TEST AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE TESTED ON A REGULAR BASIS , I WILL CONTINUE TO BE TESTED ON A REGULAR BASIS. WILLIAM BARR SAID ON CNN THIS WEEK THAT HIS ASSESSMENT RIGHT NOW IS THAT CHINA POSES THE MOST AGGRESSIVE THREAT TO U.S. ELECTIONS, EVEN MORE THAN IRAN OR RUSSIA. DO YOU BELIEVE IN THAT? IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTELLIGENCE BRIEFINGS YOU HAVE RECEIVED? JOE BIDEN: IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE INTELLIGENCE BRIEFINGS I HAVE RECEIVED. HE IS A REALLY BAD INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. IT'S NOT CONSISTENT, BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE , ? JOE BIDEN: BECAUSE I BELIEVE WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD. AND YOU ALL KNOW IT. THERE ARE A LOT OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD I THINK WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE OUR ELECTIONS DESTABILIZE, BUT THE ONE WHO WAS WORKING THE HARDEST, MOST CONSISTENTLY, AND NEVER HAS LED UP HIS RUSSIAN , LET UP HIS RUSSIAN , LET UP IS RUSSIA. ASK YOURSELF THE RHETORICAL QUESTION, WHY IS HE SO AFRAID OF VLADIMIR PUTIN? I MEAN, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? I MEAN, NOTHING, NOTHING. IT'S ALMOST OBSEQUIOUS. I MEAN, ANYWAY , I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, I BELIEVE IN A COUNTRY THAT ENGAGES IN ANY ACTIVITY TO DELEGITIMIZE OR IMPACT AN AMERICAN ELECTION IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF OUR SOVEREIGNTY. IF I AM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THERE WILL BE A RESPONSE. SIR, IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS SINCE YOU ANNOUNCED SENATOR HARRIS AS YOUR RUNNING MATE. WE HAVE NOT SEEN HER OUT VERY MUCH, INCLUDING YESTERDAY IN KENOSHA. WHAT ROLE DO YOU SEE HER PLAYING IN THE FINAL? JOE BIDEN: SHE'S BEEN ON THE ROAD. SHE'S ON HERSELF. THE ROLE IS THAT JUST LIKE WHEN BARACK AND I CAMPAIGNED, WE TRY TO COVER AS MUCH TERRITORY AS WE COULD. AND BOTH OF US ARE OUT CAMPAIGNING. SHE IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPETENT CANDIDATE. SHE IS DOING A GREAT JOB. THERE WILL BE TIMES WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER, BUT THERE'S A LOAD OF , THERE'S A LOT OF TERRITORY TO COVER. I SPEAK WITH HER EVERY DAY, WE WORK TOGETHER, AND I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN HER. THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT NOT CAMPAIGNING TOGETHER, IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO COVER MORE TERRITORY. DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER COVID TEST? DO YOU HAVE ANY PLAN? JOE BIDEN: THEY ARE GOING TO DO IT ON A REGULAR BASIS, BECAUSE EVERYONE ON MY SERVICE DETAIL, PEOPLE WHO COME INTO THE HOUSE WITH ME, THEY ARE ALL TESTED. I'M JUST, YES, SIR, SHOW UP, AND PUT MY HEAD BACK WHEN THEY TELL ME. THANK YOU, SIR. THE PRESIDENT ONCE AGAIN SUGGESTED LAST NIGHT TO HIS SUPPORTERS THAT THEY SHOULD CONSIDER VOTING TWICE IF THEY ARE IN ONE OF THOSE STATES THAT CAN ALLOW YOU TO REQUEST AN ABSENTEE BALLOT, FILL THAT OUT, THEN GO TRY VOTING AGAIN IN PERSON. STATE OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THAT IS A FELONY, IN SOME CASES. JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT. . , JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT. JOE BIDEN: IT IS A FELONY HERE IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE. I MEAN, HOW MANY TIMES HAS THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTED THINGS? HE IS A FRAUD. NOT AN OPINION. HE WANTED , MAYBE WE SHOULD DELAY THE ELECTION, MAYBE WE SHOULD, YOU KNOW, BALLOTS ARE FRAUDULENT, NOT A SINGLE BIT OF EVIDENCE. AND TO THINK IT IS ALL DESIGNED TO CREATE SO MUCH CHAOS THAT NO MATTER WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION IS, THAT IT IS THROWN UP IN THE AIR. THAT MUST BE HIS REASON, BECAUSE HE SAYS AND DOES THINGS THAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT THAT I AM AWARE OF IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAS EVER DONE. WE ALL GO, WELL, THERE'S ANOTHER RIDICULOUS, AND APPROPRIATE THING HE SAID SO MANY OF THEM, IT DOESN'T MATTER. , INAPPROPRIATE THING, BUT HE SAID SO MANY OF THEM, IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT JUST UNDERMINES THE LEGITIMACY OF OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, AND ITS DANGEROUS. YOU SAID TODAY IS THE ANGRIEST YOU HAVE BEEN AS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. BUT YOU SAID YOU ARE TRYING TO RESTRAIN YOURSELF. YOU ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLINED TO NOT VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT WHO WOULD SAY, WHY ISN'T JOE BIDEN ANGRIER ABOUT ALL OF THIS? JOE BIDEN: BECAUSE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE PRESIDENTIAL, AND SHOULD LEAD BY EXAMPLE, AS WELL AS MAKE CLEAR EXACTLY WHERE THEY STAND. GETTING DOWN IN THE GUTTER LIKE THE PRESIDENT DOES, SAYING THINGS THAT I WOULD BE INCLINED IF WE WERE BEHIND SOMEWHERE, WOULD BE A DIFFERENT THING. BUT THAT'S NOT THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT. THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT IS TO SET AN EXAMPLE. MY ANGER IS REAL, BECAUSE I MUST TELL YOU, I CARRY AND I DELIBERATELY DIDN'T BRING WITH ME TODAY , THE NATIONAL GUARD HAD A PIN MADE UP THAT IS A GOLD STAR WHO WAS MADE FOR MY SON BEAU WHO DID NOT DIE IN THE FIELD. I ALWAYS CARRY IT WITH ME. AND I DIDN'T CARRY IT TODAY, BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED THAT IF I FOCUSED TOO MUCH ON IT, THAT I WOULD ENGAGE IN SOME OF THE KIND OF LANGUAGE THE PRESIDENT HAS USED. BUT I JUST THINK IT IS SICK, IT IS DEPLORABLE, IT IS SO UN- AMERICAN, IT IS STILL UNPATRIOTIC, THAN WATCHING HIM THIS MORNING , THEN WATCHING HIM THIS MORNING TALKING ABOUT HOW HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT, HE HONORED JOHN MCCAIN HE IS THE REASON WHY FLAGS ARE FLOWN AT HALF MAST. HE IS THE SAME GUY THAT WHEN THE SHIP WENT INTO HARBOR, HE MADE SURE THE USS MCCAIN WAS COVERED. YOU COULDN'T SEE IT. HE IS THE SAME GUY THAT DENIGRATED JOHN. HE IS THE SAME GUY WHO DID THE SAME THING WHEN THE H BUSH WAS SHUT DOWN IN THE PACIFIC. BUT HE JUST STANDS THERE. , SHOT DOWN IN THE PACIFIC. HE JUST STANDS THERE. IT IS PATHOLOGICAL. \"NO ONE HAS BEEN BETTER TO THE MILITARY.\" I JUST HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHAT HAS TO BE DONE, NOT WHAT HE DID, WHAT I DO FROM HERE, WOULD GET SOME FROM HERE. IF I COULD FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION ABOUT VOTING. WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ATTACKING MAIL-IN VOTING. HE'S EVEN KNOWS ADJUSTING HIS SUPPORTERS VOTE TWICE. WILL SUNIL RUSSIA HAS BEEN TRYING TO SOW DOUBT ABOUT THE SYSTEM. ARE YOU CONCERNED THIS MES , THIS MESSAGING MAY BE WORK ING? , ARE YOU CONCERNED THIS MESSAGING MAY BE WORKING? JOE BIDEN: THE MORE WE TALK ABOUT IT , THERE'S TWO THINGS HE WANTS US TO TALK ABOUT. THE ELECTION BEING LEGITIMATE, AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS UP IN FLAMES. EVERYTHING IS BURNING. LAW AND ORDER. BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING. ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE JOB HE HAS NOT DONE. AND SO, IT IS A CONUNDRUM. THERE'S A LOT WE CAN TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFICS THAT RUSSIA IS DOING AND NOT DOING, BUT WHEN YOU DO, ALL IT DOES IS UNDERMINE WHAT PEOPLE THINK , WHAT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN, I DON'T WANT PEOPLE REACHING THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT WORTH VOTING. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I KEEP TRYING TO SAY TO PEOPLE IS, GO TO IWILLV OTE.COM. I WILL VOTE DOR COM. , DOT COM. FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU CAN VOTE, WHEN YOU CAN VOTE, ETC. PLAN NOW. THE MORE CHAOS THAT IS SOWN HERE, IT WILL PREVENT PEOPLE FROM SHOWING UP. EVERY TIME I MENTION IT, I FEEL LIKE I AM PLAYING AT HIS GAME. DOES IT MAKE SENSE WHAT I AM SAYING? I THINK THAT IS ALL PART OF THE DEAL. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. GOING BACK TO THE JOBLESS REPORT FROM THIS MORNING, YOU HAD ACKNOWLEDGED LESS THAN HALF OF THE 22 MILLION JOBS THAT WERE LOST THIS SPRING BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN RECOVERED. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE 1.4 MILLION ADDED BACK IN AUGUST SAYS ABOUT JUST THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE ECONOMY? JOE BIDEN: I ANY JOB AT IT BACK AS POSITIVE. , I THINK ANY JOB ADDED BACK AS POSITIVE. IT MATTERS TO THE PERSON WHO GOT THE JOB BACK. MAYBE YOU WILL WERE RAISED IN HOUSEHOLDS LIKE I WAS, WHERE A MOM OR DAD WAS LOSING A JOB BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY, WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR COMMUNITY, YOU COULD FEEL THE TENSION, THE EMMYS IN THE HOUSEHOLD , UNEASE IN THE HOUSEHOLD, WONDERING IF YOU CAN PROVIDE FOR YOUR FAMILY. ALONG THE WAY, ALSO LOOK AT THE PEOPLE , YOU'VE GOT CLOSE TO A COUPLE MILLION PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE PART-TIME WORKERS WHO STILL CANNOT MAKE IT, BUT ARE LISTED AS EMPLOYEES. A LOT OF THEM ALSO ARE IN THE PROCESS OF WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT , I MEAN, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE LINED UP IN FOOD LINES. MANY OF THEM WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDED BY THEIR EMPLOYER. THE SAME PEOPLE OUT THERE WORRYING, IF THIS PRESIDENT IS ABLE TO WIPE OUT THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, ALL THE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET INSURANCE EVEN IF WE HAD THE MONEY. IT'S JUST THE ANXIETY IS ENORMOUS. IS A NORM IS. , IS ENORMOUS. AGAIN, I'M NOT BEING SOLICITOUS. AMONG THE BRIGHTEST PEOPLE HAVE DEALT WITH IN MY CAREER HAVE BEEN THE PRESS. NOT A JOKE. YOU ARE ALL EXTREMELY EDUCATED, YOU ARE WELL READ, YOU HAVE SIGNIFICANT BACKGROUNDS. AND THE VAST MAJORITY HAVE TRIED TO REPORT THE NEWS, NOT JUST OPINIONS. BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU DON'T FEEL THE SAME , NOT DEMOCRAT-REPUBLICAN, OK? YOU DON'T FEEL THE SAME ANXIETY, BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SISTER, MOTHER, FATHER, CENTER DOT ARE , SON OR DAUGHTER , WE HAVE JOBS. IT IS A REAL CONCERN. IF I MAY ASK, [INDISCERNIBLE] SERBIA DEAL, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS JUST ANNOUNCED AN ECONOMIC NORMALIZATION DEAL BETWEEN SERBIA AND PORTUGAL. PORTUGAL AND ISRAEL HAVING DIPLOMATIC NORMALIZATION IS PART OF THE DEAL. YOU HAVE STATED YOU SUPPORT THE TWO STATE SOLUTION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WOULD YOU SUPPORT MORE OF THE MAJORITY COUNTRIES NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL EVEN THOUGH IT MAY MEAN THE PALESTINIANS WILL LOSE LEVERAGE IN THEIR FIGHT FOR THE TWO STATE SOLUTION? JOE BIDEN: FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS YOU ARE REFERRING TO. WHAT I HAVE ARGUED, RELATIVE TO SERBIA AND KOSOVO, IS THAT KOSOVO SHOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY. NOT A PART OF SERBIA. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD REINFORCE THAT INDEPENDENCE, BUT I DON'T KNOW BASED ON WHAT IS BEING SAID. I THINK NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS AMONG COUNTRIES IS A, BY AND LARGE, A GOOD THING. TO HAVE A MAJORITY MUSLIM COUNTRY NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL SEEMS POSITIVE TO ME, BUT I HAVE TO NOTE THE DETAIL OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. WHAT IS GOING ON. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT , YOU MAY BE RIGHT , THAT THAT WOULD CAUSE THE PALESTINIANS TO LOSE LEVERAGE ANY DECISION ON A TWO STATE SOLUTION. WOULD YOU SUPPORT MORE COUNTRIES RECOGNIZING ISRAEL? JOE BIDEN: I DO. ABSOLUTELY. I DO. I THINK THAT IS THE THING, RECOGNIZING ISRAEL AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE, I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT. BUT ALSO, I BELIEVE THAT ISRAEL HAS TO BE PREPARED TO WORK TOWARD A GENUINE TWO STATE SOLUTION. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT.

BIDEN'S COMMENTS THAT ARE FUNDAMENTALLY FALSE. FIRST, HE LOOK AT THE CITIES THAT ARE OVERCOME WITH THE ANARCHY AND CHAOS RIGHT NOW, HE LOOKED UP PORTLAND, SEATTLE, CHICAGO. YOU EVEN LOOK AT CITIES LIKE AUSTIN THAT ARE TAKING MEASURES TO DEFUND THE POLICE, AND YOU KNOW THOSE ARE CITIES RUN BY DEMOCRATS. THAT IS A , YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THE FACT OF THEIR PARTISAN MAKEUP. THE REALITY IS, YOU HAVE DEMOCRAT-CONTROLLED CITIES AND STATES THAT ARE ALLOWING THE ANARCHY, ALLOWING THE CHAOS, THE LAWLESSNESS TO GO SO FAR PAST A PEACEFUL PROTEST THAT IT IS LAUGHABLE. IT REALLY SHOWS JUST THE HYPOCRISY OF THE MOMENT. YOU HAVE ON ONE HAND, GOVERNORS SAYING, LET'S KEEP THESE STATES LOCKED DOWN, LET'S NOT ALLOW CHILDREN TO RETURN TO SCHOOLS. THE AMOUNT THE FLIP SCREEN , THEN ON THE FLIP SCREEN YOU HAVE VIOLENT PROTESTS AND RIOTS AND LOOTING GOING ON NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AND YOU SEE THE HYPOCRISY PLAY OUT. FOR BIDEN TO BLAME THAT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP I THINK IS A MISTAKE. HE REALLY SHOULD BE TURNING TO HIS DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO STEP IN TO ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO THEIR JOB AND FIGHT BACK AND QUELL THIS VIOLENCE. ON THE CORONAVIRUS COMMENTS MR. BIDEN IS MAKING, I THINK IT IS INTERESTING, THE DIFFERENT TONES THAT THE FIGHT FOR OUR HEALTH AND ECONOMIC SECURITY AROUND COVID-19 HAS TAKEN, REALLY SENSE , THE UAW TAKES OUR PROTOCOLS AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR MEMBERS. SERIOUSLY. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, THE UAW HAS LED THE WAY IN THE MANUFACTURING AND DEALING WITH THE VERY CRITICAL ISSUES AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME. WE ARE PRAYING FOR PRESIDENT CAMPBELL AND HIS FAMILY MEMBERS. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO KNOWLEDGE OUR HOST TODAY. REGION ONE DIRECTOR, FRANKS DOING , FRANK STAULIN.

THE UAW WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO BACK YOU YOU RAN FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND YOU HAVE BEEN A LOAN FRIEND. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A SHORT STORY ABOUT JOE BIDEN AND HIS COMMIT AND TO AUTOWORKERS. YOU SEE, THERE IS A PLANT HERE IN FLINT, MICHIGAN THAT TO THIS DAY FLOURISHES BECAUSE OF YOUR WORK ON THE AUTO RECOVERY. YOU WERE TASKED TO RUN THAT PROGRAM. AND THERE WAS A PROVISION REQUIRING THAT GM COULD NOT LEAVE U.S. AUTOWORKERS UNEMPLOYED WHILE OUTSOURCED VEHICLES TO OTHER COUNTRIES DID SIMILAR WORK. BECAUSE OF YOU, IN FLINT, 1000 U.S. JOBS CAME BACK FROM MEXICO TO BUILD TRUCKS. JOBS THAT ARE THERE THIS DAY WITH A THIRD SHIFT WAS ADDED TO THAT PLANT. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN NOT ONLY WALKED THE WALK, BUT HE TALKED THE TALK. AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. THOSE FLINT WORKERS IN SO MANY OTHERS WHOSE JOBS HE SAVED. IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO WELCOME YOU AND I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE AT THIS TIME, OUR VERY OWN PRESIDENT OF UAW LOCAL 5960 FOUR PURPOSES OF INTRODUCTION. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS LUIS ROCHE. WE ARE PROUD TO REPRESENT OUR MEMBERS HERE TODAY AS WE INTRODUCE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. THESE ARE CHALLENGING TIMES. WE AS AN INDUSTRY HAVE FACED UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES AND WORKED TOGETHER DURING THIS PANDEMIC TO CONTINUE MAKING OUR PRODUCTS AND KEEP AMERICA AND THE ECONOMY MOVING. WE UNDERSTAND ADVERSITY AND WE KNOW THAT JOE BIDEN DOES TOO. HE UNDERSTOOD DURING OUR INDUSTRY'S DARKEST DAYS THAT THE DIGNITY OF WORK IS WHAT SUSTAINS AMERICA. AND THAT OUR MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IS KEY TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. HE RAN THE OTTAWA CALVARY , HE RAN THE AUTO RECOVERY. AND HE UNDERSTANDS THAT IN TIMES OF CRISIS LIKE WE HAVE NOW, STEADY INVESTMENT IN THE MANUFACTURING AND JOBS WILL KEEP OUR ECONOMY MOVING AND GROWING AS WE FIND OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. HE UNDERSTANDS THAT OUR INDUSTRY HAS CHANGED THAT THE FUTURE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND THOSE JOBS BEING HERE, ARE IMPORTANT. HE ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT MANY OF THE PRODUCTS OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS MAKE IN THE REGION WILL CHANGE AS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES. WE NEED TO PLAN FOR THOSE JOBS OF THE FUTURE. THAT IS WHY WE WELCOME JOE BIDEN TODAY. HE WILL FIGHT TO KEEP OUR JOBS HERE, ON OUR SOIL. AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR FUTURE JOBS TO BE RIGHT HERE AS WELL. IT IS AN HONOR TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. A FRIEND TO AUTOWORKERS AND HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. A LEADER WHO IS ON OF US. THANK YOU. , A LEADER WHO IS ONE OF US. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music) WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN (music) (music) HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. SINCE I AM SOCIALLY DISTANCE, I AM ALLOWED TO TAKE MY MASK OFF, THEY TELL ME. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GOOD AFTERNOON. SECRETARY KERRY AND MR. PRESIDENT, I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT, WHERE IS MY PRESIDENT? THERE YOU ARE. THANK YOU, PAL. THANKS FOR THE WELCOME. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE IN MICHIGAN AND WITH THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS. AS THEY SAY IN PARTS OF MY ESTATE, I GOT BRUNG UP ON GENERAL MOTORS. MY FATHER RAN THE GENERAL MOTORS AGENCY , HE DIDN'T OWN IT, BUT HE RAN IT. CARS ARE CARS ARE CARS. BY THE WAY, I STILL HAVE MY 1967 CORVETTE. IT WAS NEW. I STILL KEEP THAT. I'VE GOTTA TELL YOU, THE ELECTRIC ONE THAT GOES 110 MILES PER HOUR, THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY. EARLIER THIS WEEK AND THE REASON WE ARE A LITTLE BIT LATE HERE , WE FOUND OUT, THE PRESS ASKED ME A LEGITIMATE QUESTION I DID NOT HAVE THE BACKGROUND ON, BECAUSE IT OCCURRED ON THE PLANE. EARLIER THIS WEEK WE CELEBRATED LABOR DAY, AND HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY WE NEVER FORGET EVERYTHING WE OWE THE UNIONS. UNIONS THIS COUNTRY. UNIONS BUILT THE ECONOMY, THE ECONOMIC ENGINE HAS DRIVEN AMERICA, MANUFACTURING DYNAMISM. AND LITERALLY, LITERALLY IN THE CASE OF THE AUTOWORKERS, YOU ARE THE ONES WHO DID IT. I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN, UAW REGION ONE, FOR HOSTING ME TODAY. IT IS GREAT TO SEE SENATOR STABENOW. GET A CHANCE TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE GOVERNOR. SENATOR STABENOW AND I WORKED TOGETHER ON A LOT A LOT OF MATTERS OVER THE YEARS. SHE WAS A GREAT PARTNER TO ME WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT. WE WORKED TO GET THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN BACK ON THEIR FEET. WE WERE JOINED BY THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST GOVERNORS AROUND, GOVERNOR RUSSIAN WITMER. IF YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE IN THE COVID-19, JUST LOOK AT THIS EXECUTIVE RIGHT HERE. [APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB STEERING THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN THROUGH A TURBULENT TIME. MUCH OF IT IS BROUGHT ON BY DONALD TRUMP'S LACK OF LEADERSHIP. HAVE BEEN ROCK SOLID. YOU HAVE LISTENED TO THE EXPERTS AND YOU HAVE LED WITH SCIENCE. HE PUT THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HURTING FIRST, HELPING THEM GET THROUGH THIS CRISIS. MEANWHILE, ON THE DAY WE HIT 190,000 DEAD IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF COVID-19, WE JUST LEARNED FROM THE WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST BOB WOODWARD THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS ADMITTED ON TAPE IN FEBRUARY, HE KNEW ABOUT COVID-19 , THAT IT PASSED THROUGH THE AIR. HE KNEW HOW DEADLY WAS. HE KNEW AND PURPOSELY PLAYED DOWN. WORSE, HE LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE KNOWINGLY AND WILLINGLY LIED ABOUT THE THREAT IT POSED TO THE COUNTRY FOR MONTHS. HE HAD THE INFORMATION. HE KNEW HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS. WHILE THIS DEADLY DISEASE RIPPED THROUGH OUR NATION, HE FAILED TO DO HIS JOB ON PURPOSE. IT WAS A LIFE AND DEATH BETRAYAL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. EXPERTS SAY THAT IF HE HAD ASKED JUST ONE WEEK SOONER, 36,000 PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE. IF HE ACTED HE W WEEKS SOONER BACK IN MARCH, 54,000 LIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN SPARED IN MARCH AND APRIL ALONE. HIS FAILURE IS NOT , HAS NOT ONLY COST LIVES, IT HAS SENT OUR ECONOMY IN A TAILSPIN. COST MILLIONS MORE IN AMERICAN LIVELIHOODS. THIS IS A RECESSION CREATED BY DONALD TRUMP'S NEGLIGENCE AND HE IS UNFIT FOR THIS JOB. HOW MANY SCHOOLS ARE NOT OPEN RIGHT NOW? HOW MANY KIDS ARE STARTING A NEW SCHOOL YEAR THE SAME WAY THEY ENDED LAST ONE? AT HOME? HOW MANY PARENTS FEEL ABANDONED AND OVERWHELMED? HOW MANY FRONTLINE WORKERS HAVE EXHAUSTED AND PUSHED TO THEIR LIMITS? AND HOW MANY FAMILIES ARE MISSING LOVED ONES AT THEIR DINNER TABLES TONIGHT BECAUSE OF HIS FAILURES? IT IS BEYOND DESPICABLE. IT IS A DERELICTION OF DUTY. IT IS A DISGRACE. WE ARE GOING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS, I'M SURE, NOT JUST FOR ME, BUT FROM THE NEWS MEDIA AND FROM A LOT OF OTHERS. BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE SUBQUESTION JACK , SIMPLE QUESTION , WHAT IS THE WORTH OF A WOMAN OR MAN'S WORD? OF A PRESIDENTS WORD, IF IT IS NOT MATCHED BY ACTION? IN 2016 TRUMP CAME HERE TO WARN, JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION, HE SAID, IF I AM ELECTED, YOU WILL NOT LOSE ONE PLANT. YOU WILL HAVE PLANS COMING TO THIS COUNTRY. YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE JOBS AGAIN. HE WON'T LOSE ONE PLANT, I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID. DONALD TRUMP MAKES A LOT OF PROMISES. HE PROMISED THAT HE ALONE COULD STOP THE OFF SHORING IN JOBS. HE PROMISED HE WOULD BRING BACK JOBS, STOP COMPANIES FROM LEAVING. HE CAN DO WHAT \"NOBODY ELSE COULD DO IT\" BUT HIM. HE PROMISED THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD FORCE EVERY LAST BUYING AMERICAN PROVISION ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHAT MAKES HIS CLAIMS IN HOPES, NOW HOPES WE DO NOT NOTICE WHAT HE SAID OR WON'T REMEMBER. AND WHEN HE DOES FOLLOW THROUGH OR DOESN'T DO WITH FOLLOW-THROUGH THE EXACT OPPOSITE. HE'S HOPING WE JUST HAVE POOR MEMORIES. HE DOESN'T GIVE US MUCH CREDIT. BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SMART, HONEST, DECENT, AND THEY ARE HARD-WORKING. WE EXPECT OUR PRESIDENT TO BE STRAIGHT WITH US. TO DO WHAT HE OR SHE SAYS THEY ARE GOING TO DO. LET'S LOOK AT THE REALITY OF DONALD TRUMP'S ECONOMY. WHAT EXACTLY HIS PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WORKERS ARE WORTH. HE IS ON TRACK TO BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT SENT HERBERT HOOVER AND THE GREAT DEPRESSION TO SEE THE NUMBER OF JOBS IN OUR ECONOMY GO DOWN, NOT UP, WHILE BEING PRESIDENT. OUR ECONOMY IS DOWN 4.7 MILLION JOBS SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE. EVEN BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FAILED RESPONSE TO COVID-19 CRASHED OUR ECONOMY, IS RECKLESS AND CHAOTIC TRADE POLICIES HAD THROWN AMERICAN MANUFACTURING INTO RECESSION. IT WAS ALREADY CONTRACTING IN 2019. EVEN WHEN COVID-19 HIT , BEFORE IT HAD, TRUMP WAS CREATING AN AVERAGE OF 500,000 JOBS FEWER PER YEAR IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WERE IN OFFICE. AND WHEN THE GM TRANSITION PLANT IN WARREN CLOSED LAST YEAR, I BET THE WORKERS AROUND NOT ALL THAT COMFORTED BY TRUMP'S ANTI-PROMISES. UNDER DONALD TRUMP, MICHIGAN LOST AUTO JOBS EVEN BEFORE COVID HIT. AND WHAT ABOUT OFF SHORING? AS TRUMP DELIVERED ON STOPPING COMPANIES FROM SHIPPING JOBS OVERSEAS, AMERICAN JOBS? YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER, OF COURSE NOT. THE RATE OF OFF SHORING BY FEDERAL CONTRACTORS , THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT GET FEDERAL DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO THINGS. THE OFF SHORING. BIG COMPANIES BEING PAID BY U.S. TAXPAYERS HAS DOUBLED UNDER TRUMP. THOSE CONTRACTS, FEDERAL CONTRACTS WITH YOUR TAX DOLLARS. THEY HAVE DOUBLED THE NUMBER THAT HAVE BEEN OFFSHORE. HE INVITED COMPANIES TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO MAKE WHAT HE CALLED A PLEDGE TO AMERICAN WORKERS. HE COULDN'T EVEN KEEP THOSE FIRMS FROM OUTSOURCING. MANY WERE GIVEN LUCRATIVE FEDERAL CONTRACTS, BUT THEN SOME OF THEM TURNED AROUND AND SHIPPED 7000 JOBS OVERSEAS. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S U.S. TRADE DEFICIT HAS GROWN. IT HAS HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. WHEN ME SAY THAT AGAIN. THE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT IS THAT AN ALL-TIME HIGH UNDER TRUMP OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ANSWER IS THE SAME AS HIS ANSWER TO EVERYTHING , CORPORATE TAX GIVEAWAYS. YOU HEARD ME RIGHT. GIVEAWAYS THAT REWARD OFF SHORING. IF YOU OFFSHORE, YOU GET MORE TAX BREAK. HIS 2017 TAX BILL SLASHED TAXES ON COMPANIES SEND PRODUCTION AND JOBS OVERSEAS. THOSE CORPORATIONS THEN MAKE HUGE PROFITS BY SHIPPING THESE FOREIGN-MADE PRODUCTS BACK TO THE UNITED STATES TO SELL TO AMERICAN CONSUMERS. AND NO INDUSTRY HAS TAKEN GREATER ADVANTAGE OF TRUMP'S OFFERING TAX LOOPHOLES THAN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. BIG PHARMA LOBBIED TRUMP FOR A HANDOUT. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY GOT FROM HIM. PHARMA , U.S. PHARMA IS BUILDING FACTORIES OVERSEAS INSTEAD OF THE UNITED STATES, SKIPPING OUT ON HAVING TO PAY U.S. TAXES. AND THEN SENDING THOSE SAME FOREIGN-MADE DRUGS ACT TO AMERICAN CONSUMERS. ALL WHILE RAISING THEIR PRICES ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT UNION FAMILIES AND WORKING PEOPLE HAVE TO RELY ON. IN THE PROCESS, TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH ALL HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA. DURING THE PANDEMIC WE ARE SEEING NOT ONLY THE INEQUITY OF THIS POLICY, BUT THE ENORMOUS VULNERABILITY THIS CREATES FOR OUR OWN HEALTH SECURITY. OUR SECURITY REQUIRES US TO HAVE SUPPLY CHAINS OF THE NECESSARY DRUGS BASED HERE, NOT OVERSEAS, NOT OVERSEAS, IN TIMES OF CRISIS. WHAT ABOUT TRUMP'S COMMITMENT TO BUY AMERICA? LIKE THE REST OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PROMISES IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY. IT IS A BUNCH OF HOT AIR. IN FACT, CONTRACTS AWARDED BY U.S. GOVERNMENTS TO FOREIGN COMPANIES USING AMERICAN TAX DOLLARS WENT UP 30% SINCE HE HAS BEEN PRESIDENT. ONE, TRUMP HAS NOT STOPPED COMPANIES FROM CLOSING PLANTS AND SENDING JOBS OVERSEAS. TWO, HE REPORTED COMPANIES THAT CUT JOBS AND FAILED TO INVEST HERE AT HOME WITH BILLIONS OF TAX BREAKS. THREE, HE IS AWARDING MORE AND MORE FEDERAL CONTRACTS TO FOREIGN COMPANIES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BROKEN ABOUT EVERY PROMISE HE HAS EVERY EVER MADE TO THE AMERICAN WORKER AND HE HAS FAILED OUR ECONOMY AND OUR PEOPLE. WOULD YOU REALLY EXPECT ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM THIS GUY? FROM SOMEBODY WHO CALLED THOSE OF YOU AND THOSE SERVING IN UNIFORM, WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES TO THE COUNTRY \"LOSERS\" AND \"SUCKERS? \" MY SON IS A U.S. ATTORNEY AND VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO KOSOVO TO HELP THEM SET UP A GOVERNMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR. I AM BEING PROUD, BUT HE IS THE ONLY FOREIGNER THAT HAS A MONUMENT THAT THEY RAISED AND BUILT IN SERVICE TO HIM, THANKING HIM FOR WHAT HE DID. MY SON ALSO IS ATTORNEY GENERAL VOLUNTEER TO GO TO IRAQ FOR ONE YEAR. HE WAS NOT A LOSER OR A SUCKER. NO ONE WHO SERVED THIS NATION HAS BEEN A LOSER OR A SUCKER. THEY ARE ALL HEROES. WOULD YOU EXPECT ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM SOMEBODY WHO COULD STAND NEXT TO THE FATHER OF A FALLEN SOLDIER AND SAY, I DO NOT GET IT? WHAT WAS IN IT FOR THEM? WHAT WAS IN IT FOR THEM? DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO SERVE SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOURSELF. HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND DUTY, HONOR, COUNTRY. HE LIVES BY A DIFFERENT CODE. LIES, SELFISHNESS, GREED, YES, DONALD TRUMP AND I HAVE A DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY WHEN IT COMES TO GIVING OUR WORD. MIND MEANS SOMETHING , MINE MEANS SOMETHING. WHEN I SELL THE AMERICAN TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING, I MEAN IT. IN 2009 OBAMA AND I INHERITED AN ECONOMY IN FREEFALL AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, INCLUDING SO MANY IN MICHIGAN, LOST THEIR JOBS, HOMES, AND SAVINGS. WITH DEBBIE BREAKING HER NECK PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WORKED HARD. HE PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE RECOVERY ACT. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN MICHIGAN AND DETROIT WORKING WITH YOU THINKING EVERY SINGLE DAY ABOUT THE FOLKS ON THE FACTORY LINE BUSTING THEIR LEGS TRYING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. A LOT OF FOLKS WERE ALREADY READY TO COUNT DETROIT OUT, THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY, BUT I KNEW IT DEBBIE KNEW. I HAVE KNOWN ALWAYS THAT NEVER IT IS A GOOD BET TO BET AGAINST THE AMERICAN WORKER. WE PROMISED TO STAND WITH THE AUTO INDUSTRY. WE DELIVERED. WE DID NOT DO IT TO HELP WITH THE INVESTORS OR PAD BONUS CHECKS. WE DID IT TO SAVE AN ICONIC AMERICAN INDUSTRY. A TESTAMENT TO THE SKILLS AND INGENUITY OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND THE JOBS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN WORKERS, THE LIFEBLOOD OF COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE MIDWEST AND USED TO BE, IN MY STATE OF DELAWARE. WHEN DETROIT DECLARED BANKRUPTCY I WAS WORKING ALONGSIDE CITY LEADERS TO GET THE LIGHTS TURNED BACK ON. TO REVITALIZE THE FUTURE OF DETROIT. WHILE NEARLY 20,000 AUTO MANUFACTURING JOBS HAVE BEEN LOST UNDER TRUMP NEARLY 80,000 WERE CREATED DURING THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. I HAVE GOT A LONG HISTORY OF NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, BUT DELIVERING RESULTS FOR MICHIGANDERS. WE NEED TO DO IT AGAIN. WE NEED TO DO THE HARD WORK NOT ONLY TO RECOVER, BUT BUILD THE ECONOMY BACK FOR THE FUTURE ONCE MORE. THAT IS WHY MY BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA IS ALL ABOUT. IT STARTS RIGHT HERE WITH YOU AND THE UNION HALLS ACROSS AMERICA. BACK IN JULY I MADE THE FIRST PLANK OF MY AGENDA TO MODERNIZE AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE THAT THE FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA. BY ALL OF YOU AND TODAY I AM ANNOUNCING ADDITIONAL STEPS TO MAKE THIS PLANK STRONGER. FIRST, WE ARE GOING TO OPPOSE A TAX PENALTY ON COMPANIES , I MPOSE A TAX PENALTY ON COMPANIES THAT SEND THEM OFFSHORE JUST TO SELL THEM BACK TO THE AMERICAN CONSUMER. [APPLAUSE] IF YOU ARE A BIG CORPORATE STRATEGY, BOOSTING SHAREHOLDER PROFITS, YOUR CEO'S BONUSES BY MOVING JOBS OUT, WELL, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE YOU NOT ONLY PAY FULL U.S. TAXES ON THOSE PROFITS, BUT WE ARE GOING TO GUARANTEE. WE ADD A 10% OFF SHORING PENALTY TAX TO YOUR BILL. NO MORE DEDUCTIONS FOR WRITING OFF EXPENSES FOR THE COST OF SENDING JOBS OVERSEAS WHICH IS A BIG DEAL. THAT COULD BE DONE HERE AT HOME BY QUALIFIED AMERICAN WORKERS. I AM NOT LOOKING TO PUNISH AMERICAN BUSINESS, BUT THERE IS A BETTER WAY. MAKE IT IN MICHIGAN. MAKE IT IN AMERICA. INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE WORKERS IN PLACES LIKE WARREN. [APPLAUSE] UAW WORKERS, STEEL WORKERS, YOU'RE THE BEST CRAFTSMAN AND WOMEN IN THE WORLD AND YOU'RE RIGHT HERE. YOU'RE READY TO MAKE IT IN AMERICA AND JUST LIKE THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR OFF SHORING THERE WILL BE REWARDS AND INCENTIVES FOR CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS AT HOME. TODAY I AM ANNOUNCING MY NEW AMERICAN MADE IN AMERICA TAX CREDIT. A 10% ADVANCED FULLTEXT CREDIT FOR COMPANIES THAT INVEST IN THE UNITED STATES AND AMERICAN WORKERS TO ACCELERATE THE RECOVERY. IF YOUR COMPANY REVITALIZES CLOSING A FACILITY, LIKE THE TRANSMISSION PLANT THAT CLOSED LAST YEAR, WE WILL TAKE CARE OF 10% OF THE INVESTMENT THAT COMPANY MAKES TO REOPEN. IF YOU RETOOL A MANUFACTURING FACILITY TO MAKE IT MORE COMPETITIVE BY SHIFTING TO HELP BUILD A NEW FLEET OF CLEAN AMERICAN VEHICLES MADE BY UAW MEMBERS, WE WILL MAKE SURE IT IS MORE THAN AFFORDABLE. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE YOU GET A TAX CREDIT. IF YOU REINSTATE JOBS THAT WERE SENT OVERSEAS, INCREASE WAGES FOR MANUFACTURING JOBS, WE WILL MAKE IT EVEN SMARTER FOR YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE WE WILL MAKE SURE YOU GET A TAX CREDIT. YOU KNOW, THESE TWO STEPS ON TOP OF MY PLANS TO CLOSE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE TRUMP LOOPHOLES HE CREATED WITH HIS TAX CUT, TO REWARD COMPANIES, BIG TAX BREAKS FOR OFF SHORING WILL END. IF YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO BUILD THINGS IN THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE UNDER OUR ADMINISTRATION, IT IS GOING TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE TO BUY AMERICAN. IT HAS BEEN THE LAW FOR A MUSTY CENTURY, BUT WE HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO IT. THE IDEA IS SIMPLE. TODAY, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDS ABOUT $600 BILLION OF TAXPAYER MONEY ON FEDERAL CONTRACTS ANNUALLY. THAT MONEY SHOULD GO TO SUPPORT AMERICAN JOBS AND AMERICAN BUSINESSES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ONLY EVER TREATED IT LIKE IT WAS A WEAK SUGGESTION. AGENCIES IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN REQUIRE, CAN WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT, AND TRUMP DOES NOT BOTHER TO KICK BACK ON THAT. I AM GOING TO CHANGE THAT WHEN I AM PRESIDENT. IN MY FIRST WEEK I WILL SIGN A SERIES OF EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO MAKE SURE WE ENFORCE BUY AMERICA AND DIRECT THE FULL PURCHASING POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIFFICULT ITS PROMISE STARTING BY CLOSING THOSE LOOPHOLES IMMEDIATELY. [APPLAUSE] I PROMISE YOU I WILL USE THE FULL POWER OF THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO ENFORCE BUY AMERICAN AND TITAN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. RHODES, BRIDGES, CANALS, AIRPORTS. [APPLAUSE] I AM GOING TO CRACKDOWN ON COMPANIES THAT LABEL PRODUCTS AS \"MADE IN AMERICA\" EVEN IF THEY ARE COMING FROM CHINA OR ELSEWHERE. WE FOUND OUT ON TRUMP'S WATCH A COMPANY SELLING DEPLOYMENT BAGS TO ACTIVE-DUTY TROOPS BEING DEPLOYED FALSELY CLAIMED THE PRODUCT WAS MADE IN AMERICA WHEN IN FACT IT WAS MADE MOSTLY IN CHINA. TRUMP DID NOT DO ANYTHING TO RESPOND. I AM NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN ON MY WATCH. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN OFFICE AT THE WHITE HOUSE DEDICATED TO MAKING SURE EVERYONE IS PLAYING BY THE SAME MADE IN AMERICA RULES. ONE MORE THING. WHEN I SAY WE ARE GOING TO USE THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REINVIGORATE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING, I MEAN IT. WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT WITH THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY AS WELL. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OWNS AND MAINTAINS AN ENORMOUS FLEET OF VEHICLES. WE ARE GOING TO CONVERT THOSE GOVERNMENT VEHICLES INTO ELECTRIC VEHICLES, MADE IN AMERICA, SOURCED RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDED DEMAND TO RETOOL FACTORIES THAT ARE SUGGESTING THEIR STRUGGLING TO COMPETE. THE UNITED STATES AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY WILL SET UP EXPANDING CAPACITY TO THE UNITED STATES, NOT CHINA, TO LEAD THE WORLD IN CLEAN ENERGY VEHICLES. I CANNOT WAIT TO GET UPSET BEHIND THAT. ALL ELECTRIC CORVETTE THAT GOES 210 MILES PER HOUR. YOU THINK I AM GETTING. I MEANAM KIDDING. [LAUGHTER] DO NOT TELL ME WE DO NOT MAKE THE BEST CARS RIGHT HERE IN THE NIGHT STATES. UNITED STATES. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON ALL THE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A NETWORK OF 500,000 CHARGING STATIONS ACROSS AMERICA, PROVIDING AN PREVAILING WITH JOBS FOR OTHER CRAFTSMAN ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BY OFFERING REBATES AND INCENTIVES TO SWAP OLDER, FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLES FOR CLEAN AMERICAN-MADE MODELS, SITTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL. TOGETHER THIS WILL MEAN , LISTEN TO ME NOW , ONE MILLION NEW JOBS IN THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY. [APPLAUSE] THE SUPPLY CHAIN AS WELL AS ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN REVITALIZE OUR INDUSTRIAL BASE AS THE HEART OF THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS. THINK ABOUT THE WORKERS IN WARREN, WHEN THE TRANSMISSION PLANT CLOSED, AND I'M QUOTING HIM, \"GETTING A GM JOB WAS LIKE WINNING THE LOTTERY.\" I WAS TRY TO START A FAMILY, I WAS ABLE TO BUY A HOUSE, I WENT TO DISNEY WORLD.\" THINK ABOUT THAT. A JOB FELT LIKE WINNING A LOTTERY BECAUSE IT OPENED THE DOOR TO A LIFE THAT HE WANTED FOR YOURSELF BECAUSE IT GIVE YOU DIGNITY, ALLOWED YOU TO PROVIDE FOR YOUR FAMILY. GETTING A GOOD JOB IN 2020, RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA, SHOULD NOT BE A LOTTERY. IT SHOULD BE AN EXPECTATION FOR EVERYONE. I DO NOT ACCEPT THE DEFEATIST VIEW THAT THE FORCES OF AUTOMATION AND GLOBALIZATION MEANS WE CANNOT KEEP GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS AND CREATE MORE. I DO NOT BUY FOR ONE SECOND THE VITALITY OF A MAN AMERICAN MANUFACTURING IS A THING OF THE PAST. WE HAVE THE MOST QUALIFIED WORKERS IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] AMERICAN MANUFACTURING, AS YOU HEARD YOUR GRANDFATHER SAY, WAS ARTIFICIAL DEMOCRACY IN WORLD WAR II. GUESS WHAT? IT WILL BE PART OF THE ENGINE OF AMERICAN PROSPERITY NOW AND 2021. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN WITH AMERICAN GRIT, AMERICAN DETERMINATION, AND AMERICAN UNION WORKERS. [APPLAUSE] LOOK FOLKS, THAT IS MY PROMISE TO YOU. KEEP IN MIND, YOU KNOW WHEN, BACK IN THE 1930'S, THEY SET UP LAW RELATING TO UNIONS THAT SAID , THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ENCOURAGE UNIONS TO INCREASE , [APPLAUSE] YOU ARE TO HAVE THE MOST FRIENDLY UNION PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHEN I AM IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR ALL YOU DO. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE. WE CAN COME BACK, COME BACK STRONGER THAN WE WERE BEFORE. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. I CARRY WITH ME , I GAVE IT TO MY STAFF , BUT I CARRY WITH ME, IN MY POCKET , DO I HAVE THAT AROUND? WHERE IS MY STAFF? I GAVE IT AWAY. ANYWAY, I CARRY A SCHEDULE IN MY POCKET. A LIST EVERY SINGLE DAY OF THE NUMBER OF TROOPS LOST IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. THIS IS MY SCHEDULE. THE BACK OF THE SCHEDULE IS ALWAYS A BLACK BOX. YOU CANNOT REALLY SEE IT. IT SAYS, DAILY U.S. UPDATES. TROOPS DIED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN , 6922. 6922, EVERYONE OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN LEFT BEHIND. AN ENTIRE GROUP OF PEOPLE RELIED ON. U.S. TROOPS WOUNDED , 53,188. U.S. COVID INFECTED IN AMERICA , 763,000. U.S. COVID DEATHS - 176,000. U.S. MILITARY INFECTIONS , 117,000 MILITARY DEATHS , 6114. EVERYONE OF THESE LIVES MATTERS. EVERY ONE OF THESE LIVES LEFT SOMEBODY BEHIND, GRIEVING. YOU CANNOT EVER FORGET THEM. EVER, EVER FORGET THEM. I THANK YOU ALL. GOD BLESS YOU. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music) BIDEN'S RECORD IS A SHAMEFUL ROLL CALL OF THE CATASTROPHIC BETRAYALS AND BLUNDERS IN OUR LIFETIME. [APPLAUSE] HE HAS SPENT HIS ENTIRE CAREER ON THE WRONG OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT HAS FAILED IN HIS MOST BASIC DUTY TO THE NATION. HE HAS FAILED TO PROTECT US. HE HAS FAILED TO PROTECT AMERICA AND MY FELLOW AMERICANS, THAT IS UNFORGIVABLE. THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN IS TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29 AT 9:00 P.M. EASTERN.

NOW, JOE BIDEN TALKS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ONGOING WILDFIRES ON THE WEST COAST. HE SPOKE TODAY AT THE DELAWARE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY IN WILMINGTON FOR ABOUT 25 MINUTES. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: GOOD AFTERNOON. WELCOME TO THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM. AS A NATION, WE FACE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT MOMENTS IN OUR HISTORY IN MY VIEW. FOUR HISTORIC CRISES ALL AT THE SAME TIME. THE WORST PANDEMIC IN 100 YEARS, THAT'S ALREADY KILLED NEARLY 200,000 PEOPLE AND COUNTING. THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION THAT'S COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICAN JOBS AND COUNTING. EMBOLDENED WHITE SUPREMACY UNSEEN SINCE THE 1960'S AND A RECKONING ON RACE THAT'S LONG OVERDUE. AND UNDENIABLE ACCELERATION OF THE PUNISHING REALITIES OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUR PLANET AND OUR PEOPLE, ON THE LIVES AN LIVELIHOODS WHICH I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT NOW. JILL AND I CONTINUE, AS I SUSPECT ALL OF YOU DO, TO PRAY FOR EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA, OREGON AND WASHINGTON AS THE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES RAGE ON JUST AS WE HOLD THEM IN OUR HEARTS, THOSE WHO HAVE FACED THE HURRICANES, TROPICAL STORMS, OFF OUR COAST OF FLORIDA, NORTH CAROLINA, OR LIKE PARTS OF NEW ORLEANS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN ISSUED AN EMERGENCY EVACUATION ORDERED FOR HURRICANE SALLY. FLOODS AN DROUGHTS ACROSS THE MIDWEST, THE FURY OF CLIMATE CHANGE EVERYWHERE, ALL THIS YEAR AND RIGHT NOW. WE STAND WITH OUR FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST EVERYTHING TO FIREFIGHTERS, THE FIRST RESPONDERS, RISKING EVERYTHING TO SAVE OTHERS. AND THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS CAUTION BETWEEN RELOCATING DURING A PANDEMIC OR STAYING PUT AS ASHES AND SMOKE POLLUTE THE AIR THEY BREATHE. THINK ABOUT THAT THESE ARE NOT JUST WORRIED ABOUT RAGING FIRES. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE AIR THEY BREATHE, ABOUT THE DAMAGE TO THEIR LUNGS. PARENTS ARE ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT COVID-19 FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHEN THEY'RE INDOORS AND NOW THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT ASTHMA ATTACKS IF THEIR KIDS ARE OUTSIDE. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, THE TOTAL DAMAGE FROM WILDFIRES HAS REACHED NEARLY $50 BILLION IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. $50 BILLION. THIS YEAR ALONE, NEARLY FIVE MILLION ACRES HAVE BURN AID CROSS 10 STATES. MORE ACREAGE THAN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CONNECTICUT. IT'S ONLY SEPTEMBER. CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRE SEASON TYPICALLY RUNS THROUGH OCTOBER. FIRES ARE BLAZING SO BRIGHTLY, SMOKE REACHING SO FAR, NASA SATELLITES CAN SEE THEM ONE MILLION MILES AWAY IN SPACE. THE COST OF THIS YEAR'S DAMAGE WILL AGAIN BE ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH. BUT THINK OF IT FROM THE VIEW ON THE GROUND. IN THE SMOLDERING ASHES. LOVED ONES LOST ALONG WITH THE PHOTO, THE KEEPSAKE, THE MEMORIES. SPOUSES AND KIDS PRAYING EACH NIGHT FOR THEIR FIREFIGHTER HUSBAND, FATHER, WIFE, MOTHER. WILL THEY COME HOME? ENTIRE COMMUNITIES DESTROYED. WE HAVE TO ACT AS A NATION. IT SHOULDN'T BE SO BAD. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF AN ORANGE SKY AND ARE LEFT ASKING, IS DOOMSDAY HERE? I KNOW , I KNOW THIS FEELING OF DREAD AND ANXIETY EXTENDS WELL BEYOND THE FIRES. WE'RE SEEING RECORD HURRICANE SEASONS. COSTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AS WELL. LAST MONTH, HURRICANE LAURA INTENSIFIED AT A NEAR RECORD RATE. JUST BEFORE ITS LANDFALL ALONG THE LOUISIANA GULF COAST. IT'S A TROUBLING MARKER. NOT FOR JUST THE INCREASED FREQUENT STHOIF HURRICANE, BUT MORE POWERFUL AND DESTRUCKIVE STORM. THEY'RE CAUSING RECORD DAMAGE AFTER RECORD DAMAGE TO PEOPLE'S HOMES, LIVES, AND LIVELIHOODS. BEFORE IT INTENSIFIES , INTENSIFIED AND HIT THE GULF COAST, LAURA RAVEPBLED PUERTO RICO WHERE THREE YEARS AGO HURRICANE MARIA, OUR FELLLOW AMERICANS THERE ARE STILL RECOVERING FROM ITS DAMAGE AND DEVASTATION. THINK ABOUT THAT REALITY. OUR FELLOW AMERICANS ARE STILL PUTTING THINGS BACK TOGETHER FROM THE LAST BIG STORM AS THEY FACE THE NEXT ONE. WE'VE SEEN HISTORIC FLOODING IN THE MIDWEST, OFTEN COMPOUNDING THE DAMAGE DELIVERED BY LAST YEAR'S FLOODS THAT COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DAMAGE. MANY OF YOU TRAVEL THROUGH THE MIDWEST WITH ME ON THAT BUS TOUR AND YOU SAW IT. THIS PAST SPRING IN MIDLAND, MICHIGAN, EXPERIENCED A FLOOD SO DEVASTATING, WITH DEADLY FLASH FLOODING, OVERRUNNING DAMS AN ROADWAYS, THAT IT DISPLACED 10,000 RESIDENTS. IT WAS CONSIDERED ONCE IN A 500-YEAR WEATHER EVENT. BUT THOSE ONCE IN MANY GENERATION EVENTS, THEY'RE NOW HAPPENING EVERY YEAR. THE PAST 10 YEARS WERE THE HOTTEST DECADE EVER RECORDED. THE ARCTIC IS LITERALLY MELTING. PARTS ARE ACTUALLY ON FIRE. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN AMERICA IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS CONNECTED TO ALL OF. THIS WITH EVERY BOUT OF NATURE'S FURY CREATED BY OUR OWN INACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE, MORE AMERICANS SEE AND FEEL THE DEVASTATION. WHETHER IN A BIG CITY, SMALL TOWNS, ON COASTLINES OR FARMLANDS. IT'S HAPPENING EVERYWHERE. IT'S HAPPENING NOW. AND IT AFFECTS US ALL. NEARLY 200 CITIES, NOT REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC CITIES, 200 CITIES ARE EXPERIENCING THE LONGEST STRETCHES OF DEADLY HEAT WAVES IN 50 YEARS. IT REQUIRES THEM TO HELP THEIR POOR AND ELDERLY RESIDENTS ADAPT TO THE EXTREME HEAT TO SIMPLY STAY ALIVE. ESPECIALLY IN THE HOMES WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONINGING, WHICH MANY DON'T HAVE. OUR FAMILY FARMERS IN THE MIDWEST ARE FACING HISTORIC DROUGHT. THOSE FOLLOW RECORD FLOODS AND HURRICANES. SPED BY WINDSTORMS. ALL THIS YEAR. THE SPEED OF THOSE WIND STORMS HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE, WHEN YOU SAW IT ON TELEVISION OR SAW IT IN PERSON. IT'S RAVAGED MILLIONS OF ACRES OF CORN, SOYBEAN AND OTHER CROPS. THEY'RE VERY LIVELIHOODS THAT SUSTAIN THEIR FAMILIES AND OUR ECONOMY FOR GENERATIONS IS NOW IN JEOPARDY. HOW THEY PAY THEIR BILLS THIS YEAR? WHAT WILL BE LEFT TO PASS ON TO THEIR KIDS? AND NONE OF THIS IS HAPPENING IN A VACUUM. A RECENT STUDY SHOWED AIR POLLUTION IS LINKED WITH INCREASED RISK OF DEATH FROM COVID-19. OUR ECONOMY CAN'T RECOVER IF IT CAN'T BUILD BACK. WITH MORE RESILIENCY, MORE ABILITY TO WITH STAND EXTREME WEATHER. EXTREME WEATHER THAT WILL ONLY COME WITH GREATER FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY. THE UNRELENTING IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTS EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY ONE OF US. BUT TOO OFTEN THE BRUNT FALLS DISPROPORTIONATELY ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, EXACERBATING THE NEED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. SORRY, THAT WAS A BUG. SPEAKING OF THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE INTERLOCKING CRISES OF OUR TIME REQUIRES ACTION, NOT DENIAL. REQUIRES LEADERSHIP. NOT SCAPEGOATING. IT REQUIRES THE PRESIDENT TO MEET THE THRESHOLD DUTY OF THE OFFICE TO CARE, TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. TO DEFEND US FROM EVERY ATTACK, SEEN AND UNSEEN. ALWAYS AND WITHOUT EXCEPTION. BECAUSE HERE'S THE DEAL. HURRICANES DON'T SWERVE TO AVOID RED STATES OR BLUE STATES. WILDFIRES DON'T SKIP TOWNS THAT VOTED A CERTAIN WAY. THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE DON'T PICK AND CHOOSE. THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PARTISAN PHENOMENON. IT'S SCIENCE. AND OUR RESPONSE SHOULD BE THE SAME, GROUNDED IN SCIENCE. ACTING TOGETHER, ALL OF US. BUT LIKE WITH OUR FEDERAL RESPONSE TO COVID-19, THE LACK OF A NATIONAL STRATEGY ON CLIMATE, ON CLIMATE CHANGE OVERALL, LEAVES US WITH A PATCHWORK OF SOLUTIONS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT'S BEEN MADE WORSE BY THE CHANGES THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE. I'M SPEAKING FROM DELAWARE. WE'RE THE LOWEST LYING STATE IN THE NATION REL TOIVE SEA LEVEL. WE'RE JUST , RELATIVE TO SEA LEVEL. WHERE JUST LAST WEEK DELAWARE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUED 31, 31 BIG FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES. ALLEGING THAT THEY KNOWINGLY WREAKED HAVOC AND DAMAGE ON CLIMATE. OUR CLIMATE. DAMAGE THAT IS PLAIN FOR EVERYONE TO SEE BUT THE PRESIDENT. AS HE FLIES TO CALIFORNIA TODAY , WE KNOW HE HAS NO INTEREST IN MEETING THIS MOMENT. WE KNOW HE WON'T LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS OR TREAT THIS DISASTER WITH THE URGENCY IT DEMANDS. AS ANY PRESIDENT SHOULD DO DURING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. HE'S ALREADY SAID HE WANTED TO WITHHOLD AID TO CALIFORNIA, TO PUNISH THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM. THIS IS ANOTHER CRISIS, ANOTHER CRISIS HE WON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR. THE WEST IS LITERALLY ON FIRE AND HE BLAMES THE PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES AND COMMUNITIES ARE BURNING. HE SAYS, QUOTE, YOU GOT TO CLEAN YOUR FLOORS, YOU GOT TO CLEAN YOUR FORESTS. THIS IS THE SAME PRESIDENT WHO THREW PAPER TOWELS ON THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO INSTEAD OF TRULY HELPING THEM RECOVER AND REBUILD. WE KNOW HIS DI DISDAIN FOR OUR OWN MILITARY LEADERS AND OUR VETERANS. JUST LAST YEAR THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT REPORTED THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A DIRECT THREAT TO MORE THAN 2\/3 OF THE MILITARY'S OPERATIONALLY CRITICAL INSTALLATIONS. THAT'S WHAT THE MILITARY WARNED HIM. AND THIS COULD WELL BE , THIS WELL COULD BE A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE. DONALD TRUMP'S CLIMATE DENIAL MAY NOT HAVE CAUSED THESE FIRES AND RECORD FLOODS AND RECORD HURRICANES, BUT IF HE GETS A SECOND TERM, THESE HELLISH EVENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BECOME MORE COMMON, MORE DEVASTATING AND MORE DEADLY. MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP WARNS THAT INTEGRATION IS THREATENING OUR SUBURBS. IT'S RIDICULOUS. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS ACTUALLY THREATENING OUR SUBURBS? WILDFIRES ARE BURNING THE SUBURBS OF THE WEST. FLOODS ARE WIPING OUT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE MIDWEST. HURRICANES ARE IMPERILING SUBURBAN LIFE ALONG OUR COAST. IF WE HAVE FOUR MORE YEARS OF TRUMP'S CLIMATE DENIAL, HOW MANY SUBURBS WILL BE BURNED AND WILDFIRES , IN WILDFIRES? HOW MANY SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOODS WILL HAVE BEEN FLOODED OUT? HOW MANY SUBURBS WILL HAVE BEEN BLOWN AWAY IN SUPERSTORMS? IF YOU GIVE A CLIMATE ARSONIST FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WHY WOULD ANYONE BE SURPRISED IF WE HAVE MORE AMERICA ABLAZE? IF YOU GIVE A CLIMATE DENIER FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WHY WOULD ANYONE BE SURPRISED WHEN MORE OF AMERICA IS UNDERWATER? WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO RESPECTS SCIENCE. WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE DAMAGE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY HERE. UNLESS WE TAKE URGENT ACTION, WE'LL SEE , IT WILL SOON BE MORE CATASTROPHIC. A PRESIDENT RECOGNIZES, UNDERSTANDS AND CARES THAT AMERICANS ARE DYING, WHICH MAKES PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CLIMATE DENIALISM, HIS DISDAIN FOR SCIENCE AND FACTS, ALL THE MORE UNCONSCIONABLE. ONCE AGAIN, HE FAILS THE MOST BASIC DUTY TO A NATION. HE FAILS TO PROTECT US FROM THE PANDEMIC, FROM AN ECONOMIC FREEFALL, FROM RACIAL UNREST, FROM THE RAVAGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT SAFE IN DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA. THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA. HE'S IN CHARGE. WHAT HE DOESN'T GET IS THAT EVEN IN A CRISIS, THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN WE STAND UP AND ACT TOGETHER. AND WHILE SO MANY OF YOU ARE HURTING RIGHT NOW, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IF YOU GIVE ME THE HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR PRESIDENT, WE CAN AND WE WILL MEET THIS MOMENT WITH URGENCY AND PURPOSE. WE CAN AND WE WILL SOLVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND WE'LL BUILD BACK BETTER THAN WE WERE BEFORE. YOU KNOW, WHEN DONALD TRUMP THINKS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, HE THINKS HOAX. WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT, I THINK JOBS. GOOD PAYING UNIONS THAT PUT AMERICANS TO WORK, BUILDING A STRONGER, MORE CLIMATE-RESILIENT NATION. A NATION MODERNIZED, WE HAVE MODERNIZED WATER AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. AN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE TO WITH STAND THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME WEATHER AND CHANGING CLIMATE. WHEN DONALD TRUMP THINKS ABOUT RENEWABLE ENERGY, HE SEES WIND MILLS SOMEHOW AS CAUSING CANCER . I SEE AMERICAN MANUFACTURING, AMERICAN WORKERS RACING TO LEAD THE GLOBAL MARKET. I SEE FARMERS MAKING AGRICULTURE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO EMISSIONS. AND IN THE PROCESS, GAINING NEW SOURCES OF INCOME. WHEN DONALD TRUMP THINKS ABOUT L.E.D. LIGHT BULBS, HE SAYS HE DOESN'T LIKE THEM BECAUSE THE LIGHTS ARE NO GOOD. THEY ALWAYS MAKE HIM LOOK ORANGE. I SEE SMALL BUSINESSES AND MASTER ELECTRICIANS DESIGNING AND INSTALLING AWARD-WINNING ENERGY CONSERVATION MEASURES, REBUILDING BUILDINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THIS IS GOING TO REDUCE ELECTRICAL CONSUMPTION AND SAVE BUSINESSES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN ENERGY COSTS. WHILE HE TURNS AGAINST OUR ALLIES, I'LL BRING US BACK INTO THE PARIS AGREEMENT. I'LL PUT US BACK INTO THE BUSINESS OF LEADING THE WORLD ON CLIMATE CHANGE. AND I'LL CHALLENGE EVERY OTHER COUNTRY TO UP THE ANTE ON CLIMATE COMMITMENTS. WHERE HE REVERSES THE OBAMA-BIDEN FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, HE PICKS BIG OIL. HE PICKS BIG OIL COMPANIES OVER AMERICAN WORKERS. EVEN WHEN THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY AGREED. AND NOT ONLY BRINGS , I'LL NOT ONLY BRING THE STANDARDS BACK, I'LL SET NEW AMBITIOUS ONES THAT OUR WORKERS ARE READY TO MEET. I'LL ALSO SEE AMERICAN WORKERS BUILDING AND INSTALLING 500,000 ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS ALONG OUR NEWLY ENGAGED INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS AND HIGHWAYS. ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I SEE AMERICAN CONSUMERS SWITCHING TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES THROUGH REBATES AND INITIATIVES. NOT ONLY THAT, THE UNITED STATES OWNS ONE OF THE , AND MAINTAINS ENORMOUS FLEET OF VEHICLES. AND WE'RE GOING TO HARNESS THE PURCHASING POWER OF OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BUYING ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT ARE MADE AND SOURCED BY UNION WORKERS RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND TOGETHER THIS WILL MEAN MORE THAN A MILLION NEW JOBS IN THE AMERICAN AUTO INDUSTRY. YOU KNOW, AND WE'LL DO ANOTHER BIG THING. IT WILL PUT US ON A PATH TO ACHIEVING A CARBON POLLUTION-FREE ELECTRIC SECTOR, ELECTRICITY SECTOR, BY 2035. THAT NO FUTURE PRESIDENT CAN COME ALONG AND TURN BACK. TRANSFORMING THE ELECTRICAL SECTOR POWER TO PRODUCE POWER WITHOUT CARBON POLLUTION. IT WILL BE THE GREATEST SPUR TO JOB CREATION AND ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS IN THE 21ST CENTURY. NOT TO MENTION THE POSITIVE BENEFITS TO OUR HEALTH AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. WE NEED TO GET TO WORK RIGHT AWAY. WE'LL NEED SCIENTISTS AT THE NATIONAL LABS AND LAND GRANT UNIVERSITIES TO START BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, TO IMPROVE AND INNOVATE TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED TO GENERATE , STORE AND TRANSMIT THIS CLEAN ELECTRIC. WE NEED ENGINEERS TO DESIGN AND WORKERS TO MANUFACTURE THESE NEW PRODUCTS. WE'LL NEED IRON WORKERS AND WELDERS TO INSTALL THEM. WE'LL NEED TO BECOME THE WORLD'S LARGEST EXPORTER OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES, CREATING EVEN MORE JOBS, SOURCED IN AMERICA. WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION RESCUED THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND HELPED THEM RETOOL. WE MADE SO LEA , SOLAR ENERGY COST-COMPETITIVE WITH TRADITIONAL ENERGY. AND WEATHERIZED MORE THAN A MILLION HOMES, WHICH IS JUST THE BEGINNING IF WE GET RE-ELECTED. AND WE'LL DO IT AGAIN. BIGGER AND FASTER AND BETTER THAN BEFORE. WE'LL ALSO BUILD 1.5 MILLION NEW ENERGY EFFICIENT HOMES AND PUBLIC HOUSING UNITS THAT WILL BENEFIT OUR COMMUNITIES THREE TIMES OVER, BEELIMINATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS, BY INCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND BY REDUCING THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP LINKED TO HOME OWNERSHIP. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS WELLS THAT OIL COMPANIES AND GAS COMPANIES HAVE ABANDONED. MANY OF WHICH ARE LEAKING TOXINS. WE CREATE 250,000 JOBS NOW BY JUST PLUGGING THOSE WELLS RIGHT AWAY. GOOD UNION JOBS FOR ENERGY WORKERS. THIS WILL HELP SUSTAIN COMMUNITIES AND PROTECT THEM FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE AS WELL. WE'LL ALSO CREATE NEW MARKETS FOR OUR FAMILY FARMERS AND RANCHERS. WE'LL LAUNCH A NEW MODERN CIVILIAN CLIMATE CORPS TO HEAL OUR PUBLIC LANDS AND MAKE USE OF US LESS VULNERABLE, MAKE US MUCH LESS VUBBLENERBLE TO WILDFIRES AND FLOODS. I BELIEVE THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO BREATHE CLEAN AIR AND DRINK CLEAN WATER. AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVEN'T FULFILLED THAT RIGHT YET. THAT'S TRUE OF THE MILLIONS OF FAMILIES STRUGGLING WITH THE SMOKE CREATED DEVASTATION OF THE WILDFIRES RIGHT NOW. BUT IT ALSO HAS BEEN TRUE FOR A GENERATION OR MORE IN PLACES LIKE CANCER ALLEY IN LOUISIANA, OR RIGHT HERE IN DELAWARE ALONG THE ROUTE 9 CORRIDOR. RIGHT HERE IN DELAWARE. FULFILLING THIS BASIC OBLIGATION TO ALL AMERICANS, ESPECIALLY IN LOW INCOME, WHITE, BLACK, BROWN AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES WHO TOO OFTEN DON'T HAVE THE CLEAN AIR AND THE CLEAN WATER. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY. BUT IT'S NECESSARY. I'M COMMITTED TO GETTING IT DONE. THESE AREN'T PIE IN THE SKY DREAMS. THESE ARE CONCRETE ACTIONABLE PROBLEMS THAT CREATE AMERICAN JOBS, MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND PUT OUR NATION ON THE ROAD TO NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY NO LITTER THAN 2050 , LATER THAN 2050. YOU KNOW, SOME SAY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO FIX THIS. BUT HERE'S THE THING. LOOK AROUND AT THE CRUSHING CONSEQUENCES OF THE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS I'VE BEEN DESCRIBING. WE'VE ALREADY BEEN PAYING FOR IT. SO HAVE A CHONS. WE CAN INVEST IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE US STRONGER, MORE RESILIENT AND IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF AMERICANS AND CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD-PAYING JOBS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME TACKLING THE ROOT CAUSES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. OR WE CAN CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH DONALD TRUMP HAS US ON, A PATH OF INDIFFERENCE, COSTING TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO REBUILD, WHEN THE HUMAN COST, THE LIVES AND THE LIVELIHOODS AND THE HOMES AND THE COMMUNITIES DESTROYED ARE IMMEASURABLE. WE HAVE A CHOICE. WE CAN COMMIT TO DOING THIS TOGETHER. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE EXISTENTIAL CHALLENGE THAT'S GOING TO DETERMINE OUR FUTURE AND A , , AS A COUNTRY FOR OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND OUR GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN, OR WE CAN DO IT DONALD TRUMP'S WAY. IGNORE THE FACTS, DENY REALITY, WHICH AMOUNTS TO A FULL SURRENDER AND A FAILURE TO LEAD . IT'S BACKWARD LOOKING POLITICS. THAT'S GOING TO HARM THE ENVIRONMENT, MAKE COMMUNITIES LESS HEALTHY, AND HOLD BACK ECONOMIC PROGRESS WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES RACE AHEAD. IT'S A MINDSET THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY FAITH IN THE CAPACITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO COMPETE, TO INNOVATE AND TO WIN. LIKE THE PANDEMIC, DEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL CRISIS. THAT REQUIRES AMERICAN LEADERSHIP. IT REQUIRES A PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS. SO AS THE FIRES RAGE OUT WEST ON THIS DAY, OUR PRAYERS REMAIN WITH EVERYONE UNDER THE ASH. I KNOW IT'S HARD TO SEE THE SUNRISE BELIEVING TODAY WILL BE A BETTER DAY THAN YESTERDAY. AMERICANS FACE THIS HISTORIC INFLEXION POINT. IN A TIME OF REAL PERIL, BUT ALSO A TIME OF EXTRAORDINARY POSSIBILITIES. I'M CONFIDENT, I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS. WE WILL DO THIS. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE'VE SEEN THE LIGHT THROUGH THE DARK SMOKE. WE NEVER GAVE UP. ALWAYS WITHOUT EXCEPTION EVERY TIME WE SUCCEED WHEN WE TRY. MAY GOD BLESS OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND KEEP THEM SAFE AND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?475755-1\/joe-biden-remarks-climate-change-california-wildfires","Summary":"2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered remarks on the grounds of the Delaware Museum of Natural History in Wilmington on climate change and a series of catastrophic wildfires affecting the West Coast.

WATCH WASHINGTON JOURNAL LIFE AT 7:00 EASTERN TUESDAY MORNING AND JOIN THE DISCUSSION WITH PHONE CALLS, FACEBOOK COMMENTS, TEXT NEXT, JOE BIDEN SPEAKS TO THE MORAL MONDAY MASS ASSEMBLY VIRTUAL EVENT, TOGETHER BY THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN. MR. BIDEN TALKS ABOUT PARTS OF HIS PLATFORM WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR THE POOR AND HIS OWN EXPERIENCES WITH POVERTY AS A CHILD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. I UNDERSTAND YOU SPOKE, I COULD NOT HEAR YOU. BISHOP, THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. REVEREND HARRIS, REVEREND JACKSON, I AM HUMBLED TO BE WITH YOU. MY DAUGHTER, WHO IS A FULL-TIME SOCIAL WORKER, IS PART OF YOUR EFFORT. SHE IS VISITING A REAL SICK FRIEND WHO HAD A KIDNEY REPLACEMENT. HER NAME IS ASHLEY AND, REVERENT, SHE IS ANXIOUS TO MEET YOU. TOGETHER, WE CAN CARRY ON DR. KING'S POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN, BASED ON A SIMPLE TRUTH THAT WE ARE ALL CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF GOD AND EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. MY FATHER USED TO SAY A JOBS ABOUT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY IT IS OK. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE MADE THE WALK MY FATHER HAD TO MAKE UP A SHORT FLIGHT OF STAIRS. HE LOST HIS JOB IN SCRANTON, SYLVANIA, YEARS AGO. HE SAID, YOU HAVE TO STAY WITH YOUR GRANDPA. I WILL COME BACK EVERY WEEKEND. IT IS 157 MILES. I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT IT IS GOING DOWN AND ASKING MY GRANDFATHER, CAN WE ALL STAY THERE? INCLUDING MY MOM. WHAT A DIFFICULT THING THAT MUST HAVE BEEN. WE GOT OUT OF IT. WE LIVED IN WHAT WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF NOW SECTION EIGHT HOUSING FOR A WHILE. IT TOOK FIVE YEARS, MY DAD FINALLY GOT US THROUGH. THE POINT IS, ANYONE WHO HAS FELT A TASTE OF THIS LACK OF RESPECT, LACK OF OPPORTUNITY, BEING POOR UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU ARE DOING. WE HAVE DISCUSSED HOW THAT MORAL TRUTH AND ABATES THE FOUNTAIN , MORAL TRUTH ANIMATES THE FOUNDING DOCUMENTS. THE FOUNDING COVENANTS IS YOUR PHRASE. WE ARE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THE WORK LEFT UNDONE TO MAKE REAL THE PROMISE OF HOW OFTEN OUR POLITICS DOES NOT SPEAK ENOUGH TO THE 140 MILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN POVERTY, STRUGGLING PAYCHECK-TO-PAYCHECK IN THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON EARTH, SCARED TO DEATH. I CAN NOVEMBER MY DAD SAYING, WHAT , I CAN REMEMBER MY DAD SAYING, WHAT HAPPENS IF I GET SICK? LAST YEAR, AND DURING HOLY WEEK THIS PAST APRIL, I PROMISED WE WOULD NOT ONLY TALK ABOUT IT BUT WE WOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. ALL OF YOU REMIND ME HOW SCRIPTURE DESCRIBES CALLING TO SERVE, NOT TO BE SERVED. CALLING TOWARD JUSTICE, HEALING, HOPE. NOT HATE. TO SPEAK THE GOOD NEWS AND FOLLOW BY SOME GOOD DEEDS. NOT JUST ENOUGH TO SPEAK THE GOOD NEWS. HERE WE ARE WITH A NATION IN THE WILDERNESS. A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT HAS KILLED NEARLY 200,000 OF OUR LOVED ONES, FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS, INNOCENT SOULS, MOSTLY IN THE POOR COMMUNITY WHO HAVE NO PLACE TO HIDE. THAT NUMBER IS GROWING. AN ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT PUTS TENS OF MILLIONS OF YOU OUT OF WORK. FACING EVICTION. LIVING ON THE EDGE. MAKING SURE YOU ARE HAVING A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE. RIPPING THE BLINDERS OFF SYSTEMIC RACISM. AND SO MANY OF YOU THE ABILITY TO REACH GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. THEY EXISTED LONG BEFORE THINGS GOT MUCH WORSE. THOSE AT THE TOP SEE THINGS GOING UP, BUT THOSE IN THE MIDDLE AND BELOW SEE THINGS GETTING WORSE. WE HAVE LEADERS WHO BEAR FALSE WITNESS. WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF THE STOCK COULD SOURCE, IF FAMILY , THE STOCK MARKET SOARS? IF FAMILIES TEETER ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS. LINING UP JUST TO GET SOME BREAD, MILK, FOOD. THOSE IN POWER SAY, CUT UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. SO THOSE THAT CANNOT FIND WORK, EVEN PROPOSING TO CUT THE SNAP PROGRAM. TO FUND SOCIAL SECURITY. IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS WITHOUT THE RESOURCES OR GUIDANCE THEY NEED TO DO IT SAFELY. IS ESTIMATED TO COST $20 MILLION SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SANITARY CONDITIONS, SMALLER CLASSES, MORE TEACHERS, PEOPLE WITH MASKS. THOSE IN POWER WANT TO SOW DIVISION AMONG US. THEY SAY WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT, WE DON'T WANT THE SAME THINGS. BUT WE DO. MY DAD USED TO SAY, I AM LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY. I DON'T EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS BUT I EXPECT THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT. JOBS, HEALTH, GOOD OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUR KIDS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. FOLKS OUT THERE WANT TO SEPARATE US BY RACE, BY NEIGHBORHOOD, BY FAITH, TO FORGET HOW STRONG WE ARE WHEN WE TAKE CARE OF ONE ANOTHER. TOGETHER, THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN'T DO. IF I AM PRESIDENT, THAT IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT OUR OBLIGATIONS TO ONE ANOTHER, HOW WE BENEFIT WHEN WE HELP ONE ANOTHER. ENDING POVERTY WILL NOT JUST BE AN ASPIRATION, IT WILL BE A CHANGE TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS EVERYONE. WE CARE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US. WE PROTECT THE PLANET, WHICH IS THE VICTIM OF GLOBAL WARMING SO WE CAN LIVE ON. WE BUILD A COUNTRY WHERE YOU DON'T JUST SURVIVE BUT YOU'RE ABLE TO THRIVE AND GROW. IT STARTS BY CONTAINING THE VIRUS, PROVIDING ALL THE PPE, SAFETY MEASURES, SOCIAL DISTANCING, TESTING AND TRACING, PREPARING FOR A VACCINE THAT IS FREE AND ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COVID ARE PAID FOR FREE. DELIVERING REAL ECONOMIC RELIEF TO THOSE WHO NEEDED MOST. RENTALS, FOOD, UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE. THOSE IN THE GIG ECONOMY WANTED TO DO UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE. HAVING THIS HORRENDOUS DEBT OF STUDENT LOANS. SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE GREAT IDEAS IF THEY HAVE A CHANCE. PAID THE SCHOOLS AND STATE GOVERNMENTS SO FIRST RESPONDERS CAN STAY ON THE JOB. BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT EASES THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF YOUR FAMILY THAT FEELS THE SQUEEZE OF RAISING KIDS AND CARING FOR AN AGING LOVED ONE. I DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO LOOK AT YOUR KID AND KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T GET THEM THE RIGHT MY DAD WOULD SAY, IN A MONTH, WE WOULD HAVE PAYDAY. THEN CARDBOARD IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SHOE. IT IS ABOUT PRIDE IN DIGNITY. A MINIMUM $15 MINIMUM WAGE. PAID SICK LEAVE FOR EVERYBODY. HEALTH CARE IS NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING LESS SICK, IS TO HELP YOU STAY HEALTHY. EDUCATION. SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DON'T HAVE MUCH OF AN INCOME, DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A TAX BASE, MAKE SURE WE TRIPLE THE TITLE I FUNDING. IT WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS, SCHOOL NURSES, SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS TO HELP THESE KIDS. PROVIDING PRESCHOOL FREE. 3, 4, AND FIVE-YEAR-OLDS GOING TO SCHOOL. EVERY STUDY SHOWS OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, NO MATTER THE BACKGROUND, NO MATTER THE ZIP CODE, IF A KID GETS TO GO TO SCHOOL AT AGE THREE, THEY HAVE A 58% BETTER CHANCE THAN MAKING IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH 12 YEARS OF SCHOOL WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WILL NOT SPEND MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME FOR CHILD CARE UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE. I WAS A SINGLE DAD AND MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KILLED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT, MY TWO SONS ALMOST DIED IN THAT ACCIDENT. THEY WERE THREE AND FOUR YEARS OLD. I HAD A GREAT JOB, I WAS A SENATOR. GUESS WHAT? I COULDN'T AFFORD CHILDCARE BUT FOR MY SISTER, MY BROTHER, AND MY MOTHER. WHERE THERE IS FREE TUITION, YOU MAKE IT THROUGH THOSE EARLY YEARS. FREE TUITION AT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, CREDENTIALED PROGRAMS SO THAT THE DEBT NEVER AGAIN BLOCKS A PATH TO PURSUE A CHOSEN CAREER FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE SO YOU CAN RENT IT, SO NO ONE HAS TO PAY MORE THAN 30% OF YOUR INCOME. AND THERE IS NO HOMELESSNESS. YOU GET HOUSING PERIOD. IT SHOULD BE A RIGHT AS WELL AS HEALTH CARE. SHOULD GIVE FAMILIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN THEIR OWN HOME. THAT IS HOW MOST MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES MADE IT IN THEIR OWN. GIVE FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS A TAX CREDIT. PROTECTING YOU FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS AND GUN VIOLENCE. END THE SCOURGE OF REDLINING AND HOMELESSNESS. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO FAIL TO DO IT. HISTORIC INVESTMENTS THAT LIFT UP ALL COMMUNITIES SO THAT WE CAN FILL THE POTHOLES IN YOUR STREET, CRITICS YOUR SIDEWALKS, FIX THE STREETLIGHTS, INSTALL BROADBAND. DEMOLISH THE BLIGHTED PROPERTIES AND CREATE SAFE SPACES TO LIVE, WORK, AND PLAY SAFELY. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SO WE CAN TURN THE FAUCET ON AND DRINK THE WATER, BREATHE CLEAN AIR. WE HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE. FINALLY, IT IS PROTECTING OUR SACRED RIGHT TO VOTE. THE GREAT EQUALIZER IN ORDER AMONG US. THE REASON WHY YOU ALL ARE TOGETHER TONIGHT. HER LATE FRIEND JOHN LEWIS , OUR LATE FRIEND JOHN LEWIS, AND HE WAS A FRIEND, SAID FREEDOM IS AN ACT. HE ALWAYS CHANNELED THIS GOSPEL HYMN. I DON'T FEEL NO WAY TIRED. I'VE COME TOO FAR FROM WHERE I STARTED FROM. NOBODY TOLD ME THE ROAD WOULD BE EASY. I DON'T BELIEVE HE BROUGHT ME THIS FAR TO LEAVE. ALL OF YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM AND POWER TO ACT, TO VOTE. JUST KEEP THE FAITH, BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU I WILL RESTORE THE DIGNITY FOR EVERYONE ESPECIALLY THE POOR. EVERY TIME I WALKED OUT OF MY GRANDPOP'S HOUSE IN PENNSYLVANIA, HE WOULD SAY JOEY, KEEP THE FAITH. MY GRANDMA WOULD SAY, NO, SPREAD IT. EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE SOME DIGNITY.

ALSO SPEAKING AT THE EVENT, ACTOR EVA LONGORIA AND SINGER RICKY MARTIN. MR. BIDEN SPOKE ABOUT HIS DOMESTIC AGENDA AS IT RELATES TO THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND HIS ECONOMIC AID PLAN FOR PUERTO RICO. THIS IS 35 MINUTES. (music) (music) HELLO, HELLO. I AM CHAIRWOMAN OF THE OSCEOLA BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, AND I AM SO EXCITED TO WELCOME YOU HERE IN OSCEOLA COUNTY. AS WE PREPARE TO WELCOME THE VICE PRESIDENT TO OSCEOLA COUNTY, I COULDN'T PICK A BETTER AND MORE PERFECT DAY. WE ARE IN THE KICKOFF, AND IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH. WE HAVE AN OVERWHELMINGLY HISPANIC POPULATION WITH 55% OF OUR POPULATION BEING OF HISPANIC ORIGIN WITH THE GREAT MAJORITY BEING PUERTO RICAN. WE ARE A WORKING CLASS COMMUNITY, AND WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE RELOCATING FROM PUERTO RICO AFTER HURRICANE MARIA LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY NOW, WE ARE STUCK WITH AN INADEQUATE, INAPT RESPONSE TO HURRICANE MARIA AND OUR COVID-19 PANDEMIC. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO A PRESIDENT THAT NOT ONLY HAS A PLAN FOR PUERTO RICANS, FOR HISPANICS, BUT WILL ALSO BRING THAT LEVEL OF RESPECT AND CARING TO THE WHITE HOUSE THAT WE NEED. [SPEAKING SPANISH] WITH THAT SAID, IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE AS THE FIRST HISPANIC WOMAN TO SERVE ON THE OC OLA , OSCEOLA BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS AND THE ONLY PUERTO RICAN WOMAN TO SERVE IN THE HISTORY OF OSCEOLA COUNTY TO INTRODUCE YOU THE FIRST HONORABLE CONGRESSMAN DARREN SOTO. CONGRESSMAN SOTO: GRACIAS. BUENAS NOCHES. [SPEAKING SPANISH] WELCOME TO OUR HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH CELEBRATION WITH VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. WHAT AN AMAZING WAY TO KICK OFF THIS CELEBRATION OF OUR HERITAGE IN CENTRAL FLORIDA WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT. [SPEAKING SPANISH] THE HISPANIC VOTE IS CRITICAL. WE MUST ELECT JOE BIDEN TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO SOLVE THE PANDEMIC, TO RESTORE OUR ECONOMY, AND TO BUILD BACK BETTER. [SPEAKING SPANISH] VOTE FOR BIDEN TO SAVE AMERICA. GRACIAS A TODO. SPANISH] IF YOU KNOW ME, YOU KNOW I WISH WE COULD ALL BE TOGETHER CELEBRATING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH, BUT THAT IS NOT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY. FOR EIGHT MONTHS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS REFUSED TO IMPLEMENT A PLAN TO BRING THIS PANDEMIC TO AN END, A PANDEMIC THAT HAS KILLED MORE THAN 194,000 FELLOW AMERICANS, INCLUDING THOUSANDS OF LATINOS AND LATINO BROTHERS AND SISTERS. HIS INCOMPETENCE AND CRUELTY COMES AS A SURPRISE FOR AMERICANS, BUT NOT FOR OUR COMMUNITY. WE KNEW WHO HE WAS ALL ALONG. AFTER HURRICANE MARIA, WE SAW HOW HE TOSSED PAPER TOWELS FOR A PHOTO OP WHILE ASKING THE CABINET IF HE COULD SELL PUERTO RICO. WE WITNESSED HIS CRUELTY WHEN HE LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN ICON IMMIGRANTS RAPISTS AND CRIMINALS. AS PRESIDENT, HE DEPLOYED ICE TO IMPLEMENT BARBARIC POLICIES. WE ALSO WITNESSED HIS SHAMELESSNESS WHEN ASKING ABOUT THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING IN FLORIDA. INSTEAD OF COMFORTING VICTIMS, HE TWEETED , APPRECIATE THE CONGRATS. I'M NOT KIDDING. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID. APPRECIATE THE CONGRATS. BUT WE HAVE GOOD NEWS. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO ELECT A PRESIDENT WHO WILL REBUILD AMERICA, A PRESIDENT WE WILL BE PROUD TO CALL OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. THAT IS BECAUSE JOE BIDEN IS A MAN OF CHARACTER. HE BELIEVES, HIS FAMILY AND MINE, ARE MORE SIMILAR THAN DIFFERENT. HE BELIEVES EVERYONE HAS A PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE BORN, WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE, OR WHO YOU LOVE. JOE BIDEN IS A PRESIDENT WHO IS READY TO PROTECT ALL PUERTO RICANS. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU LIVE IN FLORIDA. HE IS READY TO WORK FOR US A PRESIDENT WHO WILL RESPECT THE DIGNITY OF THE PUERTO RICAN PEOPLE, A PRESIDENT WHO HAS A PLAN TO PROVIDE RELIEF FROM DEBT HOLDING OUR ECONOMY BACK, WHO WILL LISTEN TO US AS WE PROTEST DEMANDING ACTION FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT IS EXACTLY WHO JOE BIDEN IS. WITH HIM AS A PRESIDENT, WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE A CHAIR AT THE TABLE, BUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENS, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE HE WINS. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU, ALMOST BEG YOU TO PLEASE GO TO I WILLVOTE.COM AND REGISTER NOW. WE HAVE TO DO THIS FOR OUR CHILDREN. WE HAVE TO DO THIS FOR THE CHILDREN OF OUR CHILDREN. YOU KNOW I LIKE TO HAVE FUN, BUT THIS IS REALLY SERIOUS. THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTIONS WE'VE SEEN IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY, AND PUERTO RICANS HAVE THE POWER TO DECIDE IT. WE WILL USE THAT POWER IN NOVEMBER. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT JOE BIDEN GOES TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I BEG YOU, PLEASE. GO TO VOYAVOTAR.COM. MAKE A PLAN. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET TO THE POLLS? WE HAVE TO DO THIS. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF THIS COUNTRY. THANK YOU. HELLO, FLORIDA. TODAY KICKS OFF THE FIRST DAY OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH, WHICH IS A WAY TO CELEBRATE LATINO CULTURE AND TO RECOGNIZE OUR HERITAGE THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM, OUR CULTURE AND HERITAGE IS ENGRAVED IN AMERICA, YET OUR COMMUNITY IS REMINDED THAT WE ARE DIFFERENT, WHETHER IT IS THE ACCENT ON OUR LAST NAME OR THE ACCENT IN OUR VOICE, WHETHER IT IS THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN , THERE ARE MANY WHO BELIEVE WE DON'T BELONG, AND AS RICKY SAID, THE PRESIDENT'S ON LATINO DIGNITY STARTED ON DAY ONE. WHEN HE CALLED US DRUG DEALERS AND RAPISTS. HE HAS SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS DOUBLING DOWN ON DEMONIZING LATINOS. AT THE BORDER, HE HAS RIPPED KIDS FROM THE ARMS OF THEIR PARENTS AND HAS LOCKED THEM IN CAGES. I WANT MOTHERS EVERYWHERE TO HEAR THAT. IMAGINE YOUR CHILD BEING SEPARATED FROM YOU AND BEING PUT IN A CAGE THREE FEET AWAY FROM YOU WHERE YOU CANNOT HOLD OR CONSOLE HIM. HE HAS TRIED TO DEPORT DREAMERS, EVEN THE ONES WHO SERVED IN UNIFORM TO PROTECT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. OUR SOLDIERS ARE BEING DEPORTED. HE ABANDONED PUERTO RICO AFTER HURRICANE MARIA AND LEFT THE ISLAND IN COMPLETE DEVASTATION. HE EVEN THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD SWAP PUERTO RICO FOR GREENLAND BECAUSE IN HIS WORDS, PUERTO RICO WAS DIRTY, AND THE PEOPLE WERE POOR. HE HAS COMPLETELY FAILED TO RESPOND TO COVID-19, A VIRUS THAT HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY HURT LATINOS. LATINOS ARE ONLY 18% OF THE POPULATION, BUT WE MAKE UP OVER 34% OF ESSENTIAL FRONT-LINE WORKERS. 34%. THOSE ARE YOUR HEALTH WORKERS, YOUR DRIVERS, YOUR DELIVERY PEOPLE, YOUR FARMWORKERS WHO ARE PUTTING FOOD ON YOUR TABLE. IT FARMWORKERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE ESSENTIAL. WE DIDN'T NEED A PANDEMIC TO TELL US THAT. TRUMPS STRATEGY IS TO CAST OUT LATINOS AS BEING LESS THAN FULLY AMERICAN. LET ME TELL YOU HOW AMERICAN WE ARE. THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, HISPANICS WILL BE THE LARGEST MINORITY GROUP OF POTENTIAL VOTERS IN THE UNITED STATES. LATINO VOTERS WILL DECIDE THE 2020 ELECTION. THAT IS A SIMPLE FACT. IN FLORIDA, HISPANICS ARE IN EVEN BIGGER PART OF THE POPULATION, 25% COMPARED TO 18% NATIONALLY, AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR. INCREASING HISPANIC PARTICIPATION IN ELECTIONS DOES NOT HELP DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS. IT HELPS AMERICA. THE MEDIA NARRATIVES TRY TO REDUCE HISPANICS TO SINGLE ISSUE VOTERS, IMMIGRATION, BUT GUESS WHAT? OUR COMMUNITY CARES ABOUT A WHOLE LOT MORE. BIDEN OFFERS A VERY STRONG PLATFORM AND RECORD ON THE ECONOMY, HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION. UNDER THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, LATINO ON UP LIMIT RATES DECLINED MORE THAN 7% MORE THAN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS. JOE BIDEN BELIEVES THAT THERE IS NO GREATER ECONOMIC ENGINE IN THE WORLD THAN THE HARD WORK AND INGENUITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOBODY HAS MORE RESPECT FOR THE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO GET UP EVERY DAY TO BUILD AND SUSTAIN THIS COUNTRY, AND JOE BIDEN KNOWS THAT MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE LATINOS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ENDORSES ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT REWARD WEALTH OVERWORK, CORPORATIONS OVERWORKING FAMILIES. , CORPORATIONS OVER WORKING FAMILIES. BIDEN HAS A PLAN TO CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS. WE ARE BATTLING FOR THE SOUL OF THIS NATION. MEXICO IS NOT SENDING DRUG DEALERS AND RAPISTS. THEY JUST SENT FIREFIGHTERS TO HELP US FIGHT THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES. THEY ARE TRYING TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES. PUERTO RICANS ARE AMERICANS. PUERTO RICO IS NOT A FOREIGN COUNTRY. THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS. WE SHOULD BE LIFTING THEM UP. IT IS MORE THAN JUST COMING AROUND EVERY FOUR YEARS KNOCKING ON OUR DOORS AND SAYING, YOUR VOTE MATTERS. IT IS ABOUT SHOWING US THAT OUR LIVES MATTER. OUR LIVELIHOODS MATTER. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT AFTER ALL THE ATTACKS AND INSULTS, I DON'T JUST WANT DONALD TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE, BUT I WANT THE LATINO COMMUNITY TO BE THE DECISIVE GROUP THAT VOTES HIM OUT OF OFFICE. I WANT TO SHOW OUR PRIDE AND OUR STRENGTH AND OUR POWER AS A COMMUNITY. THAT IS WHY I AM ASKING YOU TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO ELECT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. HE'S A FAMILY MAN, A MAN OF FAITH. THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, HE HAS STOOD WITH THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND HAS SHOWN HE VALUES US FOR THE DIVERSE AND COUNTLESS WAYS WE MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT ALREADY. WE NEED JOE BIDEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND HE NEEDS OUR HELP TO GET THERE. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT LATINO VOTERS CAN DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION, AND THAT STARTS HERE IN FLORIDA. WE HAVE THE NUMBERS. IT IS UP TO US TO MAKE SURE THOSE NUMBERS ADD UP TO HIS VICTORY THIS NOVEMBER. HELLO, EVERYONE. WHETHER YOU ARE HERE IN KISSIMMEE OR WATCHING THE LIVESTREAM, I AM SO GRATEFUL YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO SPEND TIME WITH US. I'M SO EXCITED TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION FOR THE TWO PLACES THAT MADE ME THE MAN I AM TODAY, MY BEAUTIFUL PUERTO RICO AND FLORIDA. I WAS BORN IN SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO, WHICH IS WHERE I FELL IN LOVE WITH MUSIC, BUT DURING MY EARLY TEENAGE YEARS, MY FAMILY AND I MOVED TO ORLANDO, FLORIDA. I GRADUATED NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE. IN SO MANY WAYS, MY STORY IS THE AMERICAN STORY. WHEN I ARRIVED IN FLORIDA, I COULD BARELY SPEAK ENGLISH. BY THE TIME I LEFT, I KNEW WHAT I WANTED TO DO FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. MY DREAM PROVES THAT IN THIS COUNTRY, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. DESPITE EVERYTHING WE ARE FACING, I STILL HAVE HOPE. I WOULD BE LYING IF I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PERIODS IN THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY, AND I AM NOT ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT COMES ALONG WITH THAT. I AM TALKING ABOUT UNITY. I AM TALKING ABOUT INCLUSION. I AM TALKING ABOUT ACCEPTANCE. ALL OF THE VALUES WE USE TO CHERISH MOST ARE BEING ABANDONED BY THOSE IN POWER. DURING THIS PERIOD OF SO MUCH HARDSHIP, I'VE SEEN THE BEST OF THIS COUNTRY, EVEN WITH THE PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE TRYING TO DIVIDE US. \"DESPACITO\" PROVED TO ME THAT IN THIS COUNTRY WE WILL NEVER BE DEFINED BY OUR DIFFERENCES, AND NO MATTER WHO IS PRESIDENT, LATINOS AND LATINAS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE HERE. BUT HOW MUCH BETTER WOULD IT BE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO CELEBRATES OUR COMMUNITY INSTEAD OF DENIGRATING IT? THAT IS JOE BIDEN. HE HAS SPENT HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH RECOGNIZING ALL OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS LATINOS AND LATINAS HAVE MADE TO OUR NATION. HE KNOWS WE ARE NOT A MONOLITH. WE ARE PUBLIC SERVANTS, MILITARY LEADERS, LAWYERS, DOCTORS, NURSES, ESSENTIAL WORKERS, AND GROUND BREAKERS WHO MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. JOE HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT WHETHER YOU ARE FIRST-GENERATION OR YOUR FAMILY HAS BEEN HERE FOUR GENERATIONS, YOU BELONG IN THE UNITED STATES AS MUCH AS ANYONE ELSE. AS RICKY SAID, JOE WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR PUERTO RICO. HE WILL NEVER ABANDON US IN OUR TIME OF NEED, AND WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH OUR LEADERS, HE WILL INVEST IN BUILDING A MORE PROSPEROUS FUTURE FOR THE PLACE I WILL ALWAYS CALL HOME. A FUTURE THAT WILL MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR PUERTO RI QUENOS. WHILE I'M CONFIDENT JOE WILL HAVE OUR BACK, HE NEEDS US. THAT MEANS MAKING OUR VOICES HEARD AT THE BALLOT BOX. IF YOU WEREN'T CONVINCED BY EVA AND RICKY, MAYBE YOU WILL BE CONVINCED BY ME. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM. VOYAVOTAR.COM. MAKE A PLAN FOR WHEN AND WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO DO IT. NOTHING LESS THAN THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY IS ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER, AND WE CANNOT LEFT OUR FAMILIES DOWN. [SPEAKING SPANISH] I AM HONORED TO PRESENT VICE PRESIDENT AND THE FUTURE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I JUST HAVE ONE THING TO SAY. HANG ON HERE. [PLAYING \"DESPACITO\" ON HIS SMARTPHONE] I TELL YOU WHAT. IF I HAD THE TALENT OF ANY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE, I WOULD BE ELECTED PRESIDENT BY ACCLAMATION. [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU SO MUCH. HELLO, AND HAPPY HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN FLORIDA AND TO BE HERE TO CELEBRATE WHAT IS BEST IN OUR DEMOCRACY, OUR DIVERSITY, OUR CULTURE THAT IS SHAPED BY PEOPLE FROM EVERY PART OF THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY THE RICH HISPANIC HERITAGE THAT IS ALIVE SO MUCH IN OUR NATIONAL STORY. WE HEAR IT IN THE RHYTHMS THAT POUR INTO OUR HEARTS AND MOVE OUR FEET WITH ARTISTS LIKE LUIS AND RICKY. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE, MORE THAN BEING HERE, BUT FOR JUMPING IN AND TRYING TO HELP ME WIN THIS ELECTION. IT IS, WHERE I COME FROM, WE CALL THAT A BIG DEAL. IT REALLY IS. THANK YOU. WE SEE IT REPRESENTED IN OUR TELEVISION AND MOVIE SCREENS WITH ACTRESSES LIKE EVA LONGORIA . THANK YOU, EVA, FOR JOINING US TONIGHT, FOR THE OUTSTANDING WORK YOU DID IN HOSTING THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. YOU HAVE CHANGED POLITICAL CONVENTIONS FOREVER. YOU DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB. YOU'VE BECOME A GREAT FRIEND, AND THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR STICKING WITH ME. WE RECOGNIZE IN THE HALLS OF POWER AND CONGRESS, LIKE MY FRIEND REPRESENTATIVE DARREN SOTO WHO I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SPEAKING WITH A FEW MINUTES AGO. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO FOR THE PEOPLE IN THIS DISTRICT. WE SEE IT IN THE SCIENTISTS WORKING IN LABS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON VACCINES TO FIGHT THIS VIRUS, TO THE DOCTORS AND NURSES ON THE FRONT LINES WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK. IT'S IN THE DIPLOMATS WHO PROUDLY REPRESENT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND OUR VALUES IN COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND IN OUR MILITARY MEMBERS AND FAMILIES WHO LOVE THIS COUNTRY SO MUCH, THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING FOR IT. IT'S IN THE ENGINEERS WHO ARE WORKING TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH WILL HELP US GRASP OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE, AND THE SKILLED UNION CRAFTSMEN WHO ARE GOING TO BUILD IT. HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH IS AN IMPORTANT REMINDER OF HOW MUCH STRENGTH WE DRAW AS A NATION FROM OUR IMMIGRANT ROOTS. UNLESS YOU ARE A NATIVE AMERICAN OR YOUR ANCESTORS WERE ENSLAVED AND BROUGHT HERE 400 YEARS AGO, WE HAVE ALL COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. FOR MOST OF US, THAT JOURNEY BEGAN WITH A CHOICE TO TRY FOR SOMETHING BETTER HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, WHETHER IT'S MY ANCESTORS WHO BOARDED COFFIN SHIPS IN THE IRISH SEA OR FAMILIES WHO FLED OPPRESSIVE REGIMES AND NATURAL DISASTERS IN LATIN AMERICA, THE CARIBBEAN, OR ANY OF THE WAVES OF IMMIGRANTS SEEKING FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY WHO HAVE CONTINUALLY RENEWED OUR STRENGTH AND HAVE GIVEN US THE IMPORTANT CAPACITY TO SPEAK WITH GRIT AND DETERMINATION AND SIMPLY SAY, I CAN DO IT. ALL OF OUR ANCESTORS, YOURS AND MINE, CAME EQUIPPED WITH ONLY ONE THING. THE ONLY THING THEY HAD IN THEIR POCKET WAS HOPE, AND IN SO MANY WAYS, THAT IS PART OF WHAT MAKES US AMERICANS. FOR PEOPLE OF HISPANIC ANCESTRIES, THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS DATE BACK BEFORE OUR FOUNDING. THERE IS NO SEPARATING OUT HISPANIC HERITAGE FROM AMERICAN HERITAGE. THESE STORIES ARE ONE IN THE SAME, GROWING MORE VIBRANTLY ENTWINED EVERY SINGLE DAY. TODAY, IT IS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT THE FUTURE OF THE SUCCESS OF THIS COUNTRY DEPENDS ON HISPANICS HAVING OPPORTUNITIES AND THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO SUCCEED TO. MY TEAM HERE AND KNOWS THAT 24 OUT OF EVERY 100 KIDS IN SCHOOL TODAY SPEAK SPANISH. THE IDEA WE ARE NOT GOING TO ENCOURAGE AND BUILD AND INVEST IN IT, IT'S MIND BLOWING LAY STUPID. IN THE MIDST OF THIS GOD-AWFUL PANDEMIC, WE'VE SEEN IT MORE CLEARLY THAN EVER HOW MUCH WE RELY ON PEOPLE WITH HISPANIC ROOTS TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY RUNNING, AND THAT IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. SO MANY OF OUR FRONT-LINE WORKERS ARE HISPANIC. PEOPLE DRIVING DELIVERY TRUCK'S, WORKING IN MEATPACKING PLANTS, STAFFING OUR NURSING HOMES, HOSPITALS, THESE INCLUDE 200,000 DREAMERS WORKING IN THOSE KEY ROLES, MANY OF WHOM ARE OF HISPANIC HERITAGE, AND WE DEPEND ON THEM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME AS WHAT THEY TRULY ARE, ESSENTIAL. WE DON'T JUST NEED TO THANK THEM. WE NEED TO PAY THEM AND TREAT THEM WITH DIGNITY. MY DAD USED TO SAY, JOEY, A JOB IS A ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN JUST A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND BE ABLE TO SAY, HON HE, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR ATTITUDES. HOW CAN WE HAVE A STRONG AND THRIVING REPUBLIC IF WE AREN'T DOING MORE TO FULLY DEAL IN HISPANIC UNITIES? THOSE COMMUNITIES FOR TOO LONG HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND OF EVERY ASPECT OF AMERICAN LIFE. THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO. THAT IS WHY I HAVE LAID OUT PLANS THAT DEMONSTRATE HOW WE WILL USE EVERY TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL TO TAKE ON THE INEQUITIES THAT HURT HISPANIC COMMUNITIES BY NUMBER ONE, INVESTING IN ECONOMIC MOBILITY, IMPROVING OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, RULING OUT RACE-BASED DISPARITIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE, AND BUILDING ON OBAMA CARE, TAKING ON GUN VIOLENCE THAT PLAGUES OUR COMMUNITIES, AND FINALLY BUILDING AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT TREATS PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AND IS TRUE TO AMERICAN VALUES. TODAY, I HAVE RELEASED MY AGENDA FOR PUERTO RICO. EVEN AFTER BEING PRESIDENT FOR NEARLY FOUR YEARS, DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T SEEM TO GRASP THAT THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS ALREADY. [APPLAUSE] THINK ABOUT IT. THEY DESERVE TO HAVE LEADERSHIP IN GOVERNMENT THAT UNDERSTANDS IN AMERICA, THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THE IDEA OF SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. PERIOD. WE ARE ALL DESERVING. I AM RUNNING TO BE PRESIDENT OF ALL AMERICA, INCLUDING 3 MILLION CITIZENS LIVING IN PUERTO RICO. I AM NOT GOING TO STEAL THE MONEY DESPERATELY NEEDED TO RECONSTRUCT THE ISLAND IN ORDER TO BUILD A WALL ALONG THE BORDER THAT DOES NOTHING TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE. I AM NOT GOING TO SUGGEST THAT WE SELL OR TRADE PUERTO RICO. I AM NOT GOING TO THROW PAPER TOWELS AT PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES HAD JUST BEEN DEVASTATED BY A HURRICANE. THE WORLD SAW THAT. IT WAS MORTIFYING. I AM NOT GOING TO DENY THE SCIENCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE THAT TELLS US HURRICANES ARE DEVASTATING WEATHER EVENTS THAT WILL ONLY GROW MORE FREQUENT AND INTENSE UNLESS WE TAKE ACTION, AND I AM CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO SAY WHAT THE PRESIDENT ALLEGEDLY SAID TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WHEN HE ALLEGEDLY SAID, I GOT IT. THE WAY TO KEEP THESE HURRICANES FROM COMING ON BOARD IS TO NUKE THEM. WOAH. YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO LEAD. I'M GOING TO RESPECT AND SUPPORT THE ISLAND'S FULL RECOVERY, INCLUDING INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE, PROMOTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES AND SUPPORT FOR FAMILY, PROVIDE RELIEF FOR THE UNSUSTAINABLE DEBT ON THE ISLAND, AND EXPAND ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. I AM GOING TO WORK WITH REPRESENTATIVES WHO SUPPORT EACH OF THE STATUS OPTIONS FOR PUERTO RICO TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN STATUS. I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE STATEHOOD TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS TO ENSURE PUERTO RICANS HAVE PEOPLE REPRESENTATION ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL, BUT THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO MUST DECIDE. THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST DECIDE AND ACT ON THAT DECISION. THIS MUCH IS CERTAIN. A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE BACK OF EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN WHEN THEY GET KNOCKED DOWN. I HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, AND MANY OF YOU HAVE, TOO. MY DAD WOULD SAY, EVERY TIME YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN, GET UP, JOEY. WE ARE GOING TO HONOR THE INCREDIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS AND SERVICE OF PUERTO RICANS, PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE HISPANIC DIASPORA, TO THIS COUNTRY, NOT ONLY THE NAMES WE KNOW AND LIKE, LIKE LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA WHO WAS HELPING ME OUT, BUT REMEMBER THE STORIES THAT DON'T ALWAYS MAKE THE HEADLINES, LIKE PUERTO RICO'S 65TH INFANTRY REGIMENT WHO GENERAL MACARTHUR DESCRIBED AS \"WRITING A BRILLIANT RECORD OF HERE IS HIM IN BATTLE\" DURING THE KOREAN WAR. WE WILL WORK TO BUILD ON OBAMACARE AND EXPAND ITS PROTECTIONS SO MORE HISPANIC PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY DESERVE. UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, 4 MILLION HISPANIC AMERICANS GAINED COVERAGE, THE LARGEST GAIN OF ANY GROUP. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL TRYING TO RIP OBAMACARE AWAY FROM PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST PANDEMIC IN A CENTURY. THAT IS ON TOP OF THE TOTAL FAILURE TO MANAGE COVID-19, WHICH HAS NOW STOLEN THE LIVES OF ALMOST 200,000 PEOPLE IN AMERICA WITH A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE SHARE OF THOSE DEATHS IN HISPANIC COMMUNITIES, OVER 25,000 DEATHS. THIS ON TOP OF THE FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS, WHICH HAVE FALLEN MORE HEAVILY ON HISPANIC POCKETBOOKS. MORE THAN 25% OF HISPANICS IN FLORIDA HAVE REPORTED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT HOW THEY ARE GOING TO PAY THEIR RENT OR MORTGAGE. A STUDY FOUND THAT ONE IN THREE HISPANIC SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE TAKEN A HIT DURING THIS PANDEMIC WITH MANY MORE LIKELY TO CLOSE AND CLOSE PERMANENTLY. THAT IS ON TOP OF HIS FAILURE AND IN FACT COMPLETE DISINTEREST IN ADDRESSING THE RACIAL INJUSTICE CRISIS IN AMERICA. HE DOES EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. HE FANS THE FLAMES OF HATRED AND DIVISION IN OUR COUNTRY FOR HIS OWN GAIN. THAT IS ON TOP OF HIS FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. IN CALIFORNIA, HE SAID SITTING WITH A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS, I DON'T THINK SCIENCE KNOWS WHETHER OR NOT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID, AT A TIME WHEN WILDFIRES ARE RACING ACROSS THE WEST AND DESTROYING HOMES AND COMMUNITIES AND ANOTHER HURRICANE THREATENS OUR COAST. MR. PRESIDENT, SCIENCE KNOWS. SCIENCE KNOWS. THEY DO KNOW. DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY TIME AND TIME AGAIN, AND THAT IS NOT A SECRET. WHETHER IT WAS IN HIS HEINOUS ACT OF SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM FAMILIES AT THE BORDER OR HIS REPEATED ATTACKS ON DREAMERS OR HIS NEGLECT OF THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO AFTER HURRICANE MARIA OR HIS REPEATED FAILURE TO MAKE SURE ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAVE THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED TO. DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE NOTHING BUT INSULT THE DIGNITY OF HISPANIC FAMILIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IT'S WRONG. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE TO DO SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE TO SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD BACK BETTER FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, ALL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IS A SHOT. MY DAD WOULD SAY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, GIVEN HALF A CHANCE, WOULD NEVER, NEVER, EVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN. I TRULY BELIEVE WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY IN THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS THAT ON HEALTH CARE, WAGES, HOUSING, EDUCATION, AND SO MUCH MORE, WE CAN REACH FOR MORE AS A NATION. WE CAN REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY AND FINALLY BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. WE CAN BUILD A NEW ADMINISTRATION THAT REFLECTS THE FULL DIVERSITY OF OUR NATION, INCLUDING HISPANIC COMMUNITIES. ESPECIALLY RIGHT HERE IN FLORIDA, HISPANIC VOTES CAN HELP PUT OUR NATION ON A PATH MOVING FORWARD. THERE ARE NOW 49 DAYS LEFT UNTIL ELECTION DAY. I AM ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE. I'M GOING TO WORK VERY HARD EVERY DAY TO GET IT. AND I FIRST RAN AS A KID, I WOULD KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND SAY, MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN. I'M RUNNING FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE. LOOK ME OVER. IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE AND HEAR WHAT I SAY, VOTE FOR ME. HERE IN FLORIDA, I AM SAYING, LOOK ME OVER AGAIN. I HOPE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU GETS INVOLVED IN THIS ELECTION. IT SOUNDS LIKE HYPERBOLE, EXAGGERATION, BUT OUR DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON EVERY VOICE BEING HEARD AND EVERY VOTE BEING COUNTED. PLEASE, THIS ELECTION, MAKE YOUR VOTE HEARD. THROUGH YOUR VOTE YOUR VOICE IS HEARD. MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE. IT MAKE A PLAN TO HELP YOUR COMMUNITY VOTE. I GREW UP IN A HEAVILY IRISH CATHOLIC UNITY IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA AND A HEAVILY POLISH COMMUNITY IN DELAWARE. THESE ARE COMMUNITIES BUILT ON TWO THINGS, FAITH AND FAMILY. THEY HAVE BEEN THE CORE OF MY ENTIRE LIFE. THAT IS WHAT I COME BACK TO AGAIN AND AGAIN WHETHER IT WAS LOSING MY WIFE AND SON IN AN ACCIDENT OR MY SON FROM A DEADLY ILLNESS. MY COMFORT IN TIMES OF GRIEF, FAITH AND FAMILY. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IS THE STEAM , THE SAME STRENGTH THAT HAS ALWAYS ANIMATED THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY, FAITH AND FAMILY. THAT IS THE HERITAGE WE ARE CELEBRATING, AND IT IS PROFOUNDLY AMERICAN, AS WELL. IT IS NOT ONLY OUR PAST. IT IS OUR FUTURE, AS WELL. MORE THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME, THE HISPANIC UNITY HOLDS IN THE PALM OF THEIR HAND THE DESTINY OF THIS COUNTRY. YOU MAY NOT WANT TO HEAR IT, BUT IT'S TRUE. YOU CAN DECIDE THE DIRECTION OF THIS COUNTRY. I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES WHEN I DECIDED TO RUN, ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I AM RUNNING IS TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA. IT'S A BASIC PROPOSITION. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN WE ARE ACTING NOW. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS LOOKING AT US LIKE, WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO AMERICA? AMERICA HAS ALWAYS LED NOT JUST BY THE EXAMPLE OFF OUR POWER, BUT THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT , ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS. OF COURSE, WE'VE NEVER MET THAT TEST, BUT WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM IT BEFORE. WE'VE GOT TO KEEP BENDING THAT ARC. WE'VE GOT TO KEEP GETTING MORE INCLUSIVE, BECAUSE THEREIN LIES THE POWER AND MAJESTY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL, PARTICULARLY THANK THE PEOPLE WHO CAME HERE AND INTRODUCED ME TODAY, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. THANK YOU.

I JUST FINISHED SPEAKING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC, THE STEPS WE NEED TO CURB THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS, AND THE CHALLENGES OF DISTRIBUTING A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE ONCE ONE IS IDENTIFIED. BEFORE I TURN TO THOSE ISSUES, LET ME SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS LAST NIGHT. EVEN BEFORE ACKNOWLEDGING TO BOB WOODWARD ON TAPE THAT HE WAS FULLY INFORMED ON THE GRAVITY OF THE DANGER RELATED TO COVID-19, HE REFUSED TO WARN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AGAIN, LAST NIGHT, IN A TELEVISION TOWN HALL, THE PRESIDENT REVEALED IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS A LACK OF SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH HE CONTINUES TO TAKE THIS PANDEMIC. NEARLY EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THIS CRISIS, ON THE DOOR STEP OF 200,000 AMERICAN DEATHS, TRUMP REFUSED ONCE AGAIN TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OR TO TAKE ACTION. BY HIS OWN ADMISSION, HE CONTINUED TO LIE ABOUT COVID-19. HE DOUBLED DOWN ON THE CATASTROPHIC MISTAKES THAT HE'S MADE. AND PERHAPS WORST OF ALL, HE MADE CLEAR THAT HE STILL DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN TO BRING US OUT OF THIS CRISIS. HE EVEN SAID, AND I QUOTE, A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT MASKS ARE NOT GOOD. UNDERCUTTING THE EASIEST, MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS WE HAVE FOR REDUCING THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE. THIS VIRUS IS STILL TAKING NEARLY 1,000 LIVES A DAY. THE FORECASTS SHOW THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE LIKELY TO CLIMB THIS WINTER. BUT INCREDIBLY, DONALD TRUMP INSISTS THAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY. NOT ONE THING. LAST FRIDAY WE LEARNED THAT ANOTHER ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS DIED DUE TO THIS VIRUS AND IT CONTINUES TO RISE. THE VERY SAME DAY THAT WE REPORTED 1,000 DEATHS ON FRIDAY, THE VERY SAME DAY, CANADA REPORTED THAT NOT ONE PERSON DIED OF COVID-19 IN CANADA. TRUMP WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY? IF YOU'RE A PARENT IN AMERICA, PREPARING FOR ANOTHER DAY THAT YOUR CHILD CAN'T ATTEND SCHOOL, IF YOU'RE GRIEVING THE LOSS OF A FATHER, SON, MOTHER, DAUGHTER, HUSBAND OR WIFE, IF YOU'RE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO IS ON THE BRINK OF TOTAL BANKRUPTCY, WHO CAN'T OPEN OR CAN'T GO BACK TO WORK BECAUSE THE VIRUS STILL IS SPREADING IN YOUR COMMUNITY, HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY? AND IF HE GETS FOUR MORE YEARS, WHY SHOULD WE EXPECT ANYTHING TO CHANGE? ALL THE PRESIDENT HAD TO OFFER LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP, WAS THE SAME WEAK AND EFFECTLESS INACTION, THE SAME LIES AND EMPTY PROMISES THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. HE STILL WON'T ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY. HE STILL WON'T OFFER A PLAN. AND LAST NIGHT HE REPEATED WHAT HE SAID SO MANY TIMES BEFORE. THAT EVEN IF HE CONTINUES TO OFFER ONLY FAILING INDIFFERENCE, SOMEDAY THE VIRUS IS GOING TO GO AWAY BY A MIRACLE. EVEN IF HE DOES NOTHING. IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY BY A MIRACLE. IT WON'T GO AWAY LIKE A MIRACLE. IN FACT, EVEN IF WE GET A VACCINE, IT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR MOST POPULATIONS WELL INTO THE 2021. YOU KNOW, SO WE'RE HEADING INTO A VERY DANGEROUS AUTUMN. THE FACT THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON MODEL, WHICH THE WHITE HOUSE PREVIOUSLY TOUTED, PROJECTS THAT CASES AND DEATHS ARE GOING TO SPIKE THIS NOVEMBER AND , BY AN ADDITIONAL 215,000 AMERICANS THEY SAY ARE GOING TO DIE, BEGINNING THE SPIKE IN NOVEMBER, BUT BY THE FIRST OF THE YEAR, 215,000 WILL BE DEAD, ADDITIONAL. THAT'S MORE THAN HAVE ALREADY DIED. WE NEED LEADERSHIP RIGHT NOW TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. THE SAME UNIVERSITY THE MODEL SHOWS, THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON MODEL, SHOWS THAT IF THERE'S UNIVERSAL MASKING, THESE DEATHS COULD BE CUT IN HALF. BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR WE CAN SAVE 100,000 LIVES. LET'S ASSUME THEY'RE OFF BY HALF IN ALL OF THIS. 50,000 LIVES. 150,000 DEAD. DONALD TRUMP'S OWN DIRECTOR OF C.D.C. TOLD US THAT WEARING A MASK IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT STEP WE CAN TAKE TO CURB THIS VIRUS. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. HE SAID, I MIGHT GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THIS FACE MASK, AND HE HELD UP A FACE MASK, NOT THIS ONE, IS MORE GUARANTEED TO PROTECT ME AGAINST COVID THAN WHEN I TAKE A COVID VACCINE, END OF QUOTE. I SPOKE , I SPOKE WITH THE EXPERTS TODAY ABOUT ADDITIONAL STEPS WE CAN TAKE TO PREVENT NEEDLESS DEATH AND SUFFERING BETWEEN NOW AND A VACCINE BEING MADE AVAILABLE. UNIFORM NATIONAL GUIDELINES, THEY SAID. AND STANDARDS ON SOCIAL DISTANCING THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO , IN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF STATES AND COMMUNITIES BASED ON THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACHES ON TESTING AND TRACING. IF WE DO THESE THINGS BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY, WE CAN SAVE EVEN MORE LIVES. LAST NIGHT DONALD TRUMP INDICATED HE HAS NO INTEREST IN DOING THESE THINGS. THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HE WON'T. THAT'S UTTERLY DISQUALIFYING. I ALSO SPOKE TO THE EXPERTS THIS MORNING ABOUT THE PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE OF PREPARING NOW FOR SWIFT, ORGANIZED AND FREE DISTRIBUTION OF A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE COVID-19 VACCINE WHEN IT ARRIVES. AND I'M PROFOUNDLY GRATEFUL FOR THE SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS WORKING TIRELESSLY TO ENSURE THAT THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE BECOMES A REALITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THESE SCIENTISTS CARRY THE HOPES OF OUR NATION, OUR ENTIRE NATION , AND THE ENTIRE WORLD. WHEN THE WORK COMES TO FRUITION, AND IT WILL, THERE WILL BE NO DOUBT IT WILL SAVE LIVES. BUT SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGHS DON'T CARE ABOUT CALENDARS. ANY MORE THAN THE VIRUS DOES. THEY CERTAINLY DON'T ADHERE TO ELECTION CYCLES. AND THEIR TIMING, APPROVAL AND DISTRIBUTION SHOULD NEVER EVER BE DISTORTED BY POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS. THEY SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY SCIENCE AND SAFETY ALONE. A VACCINE WOULD OFFER A WAY BACK TO NORMALCY AND A PATH TOWARD BETTER DAYS FOR ALL OF US. NOT ONLY HERE BUT AROUND THE WORLD. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. ONCE WE HAVE IT, IT'S GOING TO TAKE MONTHS TO DISTRIBUTE IT TO THE ENTIRE POPULATION. I'M MORE HOPEFUL THAN EVER IN THE POWER OF SCIENCE TO GET US THERE. BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN. WE CAN'T ALLOW POLITICS TO INTERFERE WITH A VACCINE IN ANY WAY. AMERICANS HAVE HAD TO ENDURE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INCOMPETENCE AND DISHONESTY WHEN IT COMES TO TESTING AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO REPEAT THOSE FIASCOS. WHEN IT COMES TO A VACCINE, WHEN IT OCCURS. THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH. AMERICAN FAMILIES HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED AND SACRIFICED TOO MUCH. SO LET ME BE CLEAR. I TRUST VACCINES, I TRUST SCIENTISTS, BUT I DON'T TRUST DONALD TRUMP. AT THIS MOMENT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN'T EITHER. LAST WEEK SENATOR HARRIS AND I LAID OUT THREE QUESTIONS THIS ADMINISTRATION'S GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER TO ASSURE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT POLITICS WILL NOT PLAY A ROLE WHATSOEVER IN THE VACCINE PROCESS. IF DONALD TRUMP CAN'T GIVE ANSWERS AND HIS ADMINISTRATION CAN'T GIVE ANSWERS TO THESE THREE QUESTIONS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE. IF THEY CAN, THEY SHOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE TRANSPARENCY THEY NEED TO TRUST THE VACCINE AND ADOPT IT IN NUMBERS THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. FIRST QUESTION, WHAT CRITERIA WILL BE USED TO ENSURE THAT A VACCINE MEETS THE SCIENTIFIC STANDARD OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVE SNNS WHAT'S THE CRITERIA? , EFFECTIVENESS? WHAT'S THE CRITERIA? SECOND, IF THE ADMINISTRATION GREEN LIGHTS A VACCINE, WHO WILL VALIDATE THAT THE DECISION WAS DRIVEN BY SCIENCE RATHER THAN POLITICS? WHAT GROUP OF SCIENTISTS WILL THAT BE? THIRDLY, HOW CAN WE BE SURE THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINE WILL TAKE PLACE SAFELY, COST-FREE, AND WITHOUT A HINT OF FAVORITISM? THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS DEVELOPMENT OF THE VACCINE IS ONLY PART OF THE BATTLE. DISTRIBUTING THE VACCINE TO THE ENTIRE POPULATION IS AS COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING AS ONE OF THE MOST SENSITIVE MILITARY OPERATIONS. I'VE BEEN CALLING FOR AN EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION PLAN TO BE LAID OUT FOR MONTHS. IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, I'LL BEGIN BY IMPLEMENTING AN EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION PLAN FROM THE MINUTE I TAKE OFFICE. THAT'S WHAT I DISCUSSED WITH THE EXPERTS IN THE THEY LAID OUT A CLEAR PLAN, THEY INCLUDE A DETAILED TIME CHANGE FROM WHEN PEOPLE CAN GET THE VACCINE. CLEAR DELINEATION OF PIRATE POSITION TO GET THE VACCINE, SPECIFIC NEEDS , MEANS AND MECHANISMS FOR SHIPPING AND STORING VACCINES AT APPROPRIATE TEMPERATURES, TWO OF THOSE VACCINES THAT HAVE COME FORWARD HAVE NEEDED TO BE SHIPPED AT 70 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. THE DESERT , DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY HAS TO BE CLEAR AND I WILL PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THAT PLAN. I WILL LEVEL WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, I WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, AND I WILL SUPPORT RATHER THAN TERRY BROWN , TEAR DOWN THE EXPERTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE PLAN. I WILL SIMPLY FOLLOW THE SILENCE , SCIENCE. IS THESE THREE QUESTIONS THAT SENATOR HARRIS AND I HAVE LAYERED , LAID OUT SO THAT EVERY AMERICAN CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COVID-19 VACCINE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS, IT IS ABOUT SAVING LIVES, IT IS ABOUT GETTING BACK TO OUR LOVED ONES AND FRIENDS MAKING SURE THEY ARE SAFE. IT IS ABOUT GETTING OUR ECONOMY BACK ON ITS FEET, GETTING BACK TO THE MOVIE THEATERS AND RESTAURANTS AND BALLPARKS. IT IS ABOUT GETTING BACK TO OUR LIVES. I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN AND WILL BE UNITED IN THAT PURSUIT. NO MATTER WHEN THAT BIG , BREAKTHROUGH EMERGES, THAT IS WHAT AMERICA DOES BEST, WE UNITE, WE DO IT TOGETHER. I AM CONFIDENT WE WILL BE ABLE TO, I WANT TO THANK YOU, GOD BLESS OUR SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS AND OUR FRONT-LINE WORKERS AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. I AM HAPPY TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS NOW IF THAT IS OK. EVERYBODY IS SITTING. OK. ABC, MARY. THANK YOU MR. VICE PRESIDENT, YOU JUST SAID THAT WHEN IT COMES TO A VACCINE YOU DO NOT TRUST ALLAH TRUMP, IS THERE A RISK THAT THAT MESSAGE, QUESTIONING THE PRESIDENT ON A VACCINE COULD PREVENT PEOPLE FROM TRUSTING THE SCIENCE? FROM TRUSTING A VACCINE WHEN THERE FINALLY IS ONE? NO BECAUSE HE DOES NOT HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR SCIENCE, YOU SAW WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES AND SCIENTISTS DON'T KNOW, IT IS NECESSARY SO PEOPLE CAN TRUST IN THE VACCINE. THAT IS WHY SAID YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS BOARD OF SCIENTISTS THAT SAY THIS IS WHY WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD VACCINE, WHY IT IS APPROVED AND THERE HAS TO BE TOTAL TRANSPARENCY. SCIENTISTS OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT KNOW WHAT IS BEING APPROVED, THE CONTEXT TO WHICH IT IS BEING APPROVED AND WHY IT IS BEING APPROVED. FOR VACCINES TO WORK, YOU DO NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THE POPULATION TO BE WILLING TO TAKE IT, YOU ARE SAYING TO NOT TRUST THE PRESIDENT, TRUST ME IF I KNOW I AM NOT, I AM SAYING TRUST THE SCIENTISTS. TRUST THE SCIENTISTS, IT IS ONE THING FOR DONALD TRUMP SAY THE VACCINE IS SAFE. OK, THEN GIVE IT TO THE BOARD OF SCIENTISTS. HAVE TOTAL TRANSPARENCY SO INDEPENDENT OPERATORS CAN COME OUT AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT. WHAT DID YOU BASE THE DECISION ON? WHAT DID YOU DO? DID YOU PRESSURE THE HEAD OF THE FDA? I'M NOT SAYING HE WOULD OR WILL, BUT THAT IS WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN. YOU ALL KNOW THE POLLS BETTER THAN I DO, A LOT OF THE PEOPLE RIGHT NOW DO NOT TRUST WITH THE PRESIDENT SAYS ABOUT THINGS RELATED TO SCIENCE. CBS, THANK YOU VERSE , THANK YOU MR. VICE PRESIDENT. YOU SAY YOU DO NOT TRUST THE PRESIDENT, DOES THAT MEAN YOU ALSO DO NOT TRUST THE CDC AND THE FDA NO. I DO NOT TRUST SOME OF THE PEOPLE LIKE THE FELLOW WHO JUST TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM THE CDC. HE DID NOT RUN IT, BUT HE WAS A SPOKESPERSON. WHEN I MET WITH THE SEVEN SCIENTISTS TODAY ON SCREEN IN THIS ROOM, THEY TOLD ME THE PEOPLE THEY HAD WORKED WITH IN THE CDC AND THE FDA , THERE WERE SOME VERY GOOD PEOPLE IN THE RANKS. EVERYDAY FOLKS , NOT EVERY DAY, THEIR SCIENTISTS, THERE ARE SOME VERY GOOD PEOPLE. THEY HAVE BEEN PRESSURED, THE HEADS OF THE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN IN FACT REMOVED , MOVED, MOVED TO SAY YES OR SAY THIS WILL WORK OR THAT WILL WORK. IT IS A SIMPLE PROPOSITION, IF A VACCINE IS READY TO GO, IT SHOULD BE TOTALLY TRANSPARENT THE BASIS UPON WHICH THAT DECISION WAS MADE, WHAT SCIENTISTS LOOK AT WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND OUTSIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND SAID THIS IS A USEFUL, SAFE VACCINE TO TAKE. THAT IS ALL I'M SAYING, THAT IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY, OUR SPECS , I SUGGEST A MATTER WHAT I SAID IN THIS PROCESS BECAUSE ALL THE POLLING DATA SHOWS NOW ONLY 34% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY TRUMP IS THE SAME GUY THAT SAID TO INJECT WHICH , BLEACH. THERE IS A REASON WHY THEY ARE NOT SO CERTAIN. QUICK QUESTION ON THE ECONOMY, THE FED ANNOUNCED THAT THEIR PROJECTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYED MEN ARE GOING TO BE LOWER THAN EXPECTED. IN POLLING WE SEE TIME AND AGAIN THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS AN EDGE OVER YOU ON THE ECONOMY. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS? I HAVE BEEN OUT OF OFFICE FOR FOUR YEARS, THAT IS A LONG TIME. WE ACTUALLY CREATED MORE JOBS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS OF OUR MINISTRATION THEN HE DID IN THE FIRST FOUR OF HIS. THERE ARE FEWER PEOPLE AT RISK, I THINK IT IS A MATTER OF MY BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE, MY POSITION ON JOBS AND TRADE AND WHAT I WOULD DO. FOR EXAMPLE, THE WTO JUST RULED THAT HIS TRADE POLICIES WERE ILLEGAL. GUESS WHAT, WE WENT IN 14-16 TIMES AND WON EVERY SINGLE TIME. WHY SHOULD EVERY AMERICAN REMEMBER THAT? PART OF IT IS REMINDING PEOPLE AND LAYING OUT FOR THEM A WHAT MY PLANS FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS. IF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT FROM THE PANDEMIC NOW, YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU WOULD HAVE ACTED EARLIER. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO MIGHT QUESTION HOW THE ECONOMIC IMPACT COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT EVEN IF YOU ACTED EARLIER. THE CERT , SOCIAL DISTANCING AND CLOSING , YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE RATES OF INFECTION, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE A DAY DIE DID , DIE. WE NEED A NATIONAL GUIDANCE. YOU MAY VERY WELL THE ABLE TO OPEN UP IN A RURAL AREA, NOT AN AREA THAT IS SO MUCH OF A PROBLEM OR VICE VERSA. WE HAVE NOT LAID OUT , THIS ADMINISTERS AND HAS NOT LAID OUT THE CRITERIA. THERE IS NO NATIONAL CRITERIA. WHAT IS THE NATIONAL CRITERIA FOR OPENING SCHOOLS? THEY STILL DON'T HAVE ONE, WE NEED THAT. YOU NEED TO BE SURE THAT YOU CAN OPEN SAFELY, SECURELY. YOU CAN HAVE SOCIAL DISTANCING, YOU CAN HAVE THE WEARING OF MASKS, SMALLER CLASSES, A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. YET WHY WON'T HE LAY OUT THE GUIDANCE? EVEN THE CDC INITIALLY HAD GUIDANCE, YOU TALK ABOUT THE , POLITICAL MEDICATION. THE PRESIDENT SAID TESTING CAUSES MORE CASES, IT IS ABOUT BEING HONEST. HE LOVES TO QUOTE CHURCHILL, HE LOVES TO QUOTE ROOSEVELT. ROOSEVELT SAID IN A CRISIS IT IS GOING TO WORK AND WORSE AND WORSE UNTIL HE GETS BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE STRONG, GIVE IT TO THEM STRAIGHT, THEY CAN HANDLE EVERYTHING. THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO. CNN, JESSICA. THANK YOU MR. VICE PRESIDENT, YOU MENTIONED THE CDC DIRECTOR'S COMMENTS THIS MORNING ABOUT THE VACCINE , ABOUT MASKS AND HOW CRITICAL THEY ARE. YOU PREVIOUSLY CALLED FOR A NATIONAL MASK MENDED, IF YOU ARE ELECTED, WHAT STEPS WOULD YOU TAKE TO PREVENT , PUT THAT IN PLACE AND HOW WOULD THAT WORK? I FOUND IT FASCINATING THE PRESIDENT SAID AND BIDEN DID NOT PUT IN A MASK MENDED , MANDATE. I AM NOT THE PRESIDENT, HE IS THE PRESIDENT. BIDEN'S PROBLEMS AND THE CITIES ARE IN FLAMES, I'M NOT THE PRESIDENT. I WOULD CALL THE GOVERNORS TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAY , THERE IS A QUESTION THAT I THINK THEY COULD BE ANSWERED IN THE POSITIVE, A QUESTION WHETHER I CAN MANDATE OVER STATE LINES OF EVERY SINGLE STATE. OUR LEGAL TEAM THINKS I CAN DO THAT BASED UPON THE DEGREE TO WHICH THERE IS A CRISIS IN THOSE STATES AND HOW BAD THINGS ARE FOR THE COUNTRY AND IF WE DON'T DO IT WHAT HAPPENS? I WOULD MAKE THE CASE, I WOULD MAKE THE CASE WHY IT IS NECESSARY. I WOULD HAVE THE SCIENTISTS ARRAY AND LAY OUT IN DETAIL WHY, I WOULD GO TO EVERY GOVERNOR AND I WOULD GO TO GOVERNORS AND I WOULD SAY WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS NATIONAL MANDATE. WE MUST DO IT. THE MINIMUM WHAT I WOULD DO, I WOULD NOT WALK AROUND SAYING MASK DON'T MATTER LIKE HE SAID IN THE TOWN HALL. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE MASKS, MATTER OF FACT THEY COULD BE WORSE, DON'T WILL BE ON THIS BECAUSE I DID NOT SEE IT, STEPHANOPOULOS ASKED WHAT , WHY? AND HE SAID BECAUSE WAITERS DO NOT LIKE IT. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR PUSHED BACK ON YOU ON THIS? HOW DO YOU GET A BITE WHEN IT HAS BECOME SO POLITICIZED, WOULD YOU SIGN AN EXECUTIVE THE QUESTION IS IF I HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO SIGN AN ORDER, I CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT. IF I DID, I WOULD. NUMBER FIVE, AFTER: MY HOMETOWN NEW EXTERNAL. IN TERMS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE VIRUS, COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE BEEN AFFECTED, WOULD THEY GET ACCESS TO THE VIRUS FIRST? HOW WOULD THAT WORK IN THE DESCRIPTION OF AMERICANS AVAILABLE TO GET THE VIRUS. BASED ON THE PROPOSAL LAID OUT AND THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION'S COORDINATING WITH THE CDC AND OTHER AGENCIES, THEY INDICATE THAT THE FIRST GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SHOULD GET A VACCINE IF AND WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE ARE PEOPLE AT THE GREATEST RISK. THAT INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM NURSING HOMES TO PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT WOULD CAUSE PEOPLE TO BE IN REAL TROUBLE. A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE HAPPENED TO BE BLACK AND BROWN. SO, IT WOULD BE BASED UPON THE DEGREE OF EXPOSURE. IT WOULD GO FIRST THOUGH, I WOULD ARGUE, AS LAID UP FOR ME TODAY TO FIRST RESPONDERS, DOCTORS, AND NURSES. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST , MOST NEEDED TO HAVE AVAILABLE. THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST AND IT WOULD MOVE TO THE LEAST , ONE THING THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST, BUT I THING I AM WELL-INFORMED ON THIS ISSUE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO TESTS YET ON CHILDREN, SO CHILDREN, IRONICALLY, MAY BE THE LAST PEOPLE TO GET THE VACCINE BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE TIME. THEY INDICATED TO ME 2021 TO BE ABLE TO DO THE KIND OF TESTING ON CHILDREN. CHILDREN ARE LESS LIKELY, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT THEIR TEACHERS AND THE ELDERLY GRANDPARENTS WOULD BE EXPOSED. SO, FIRST WE GO TO THE PEOPLE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE. CHILDREN ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE PART OF THIS, BUT THERE IS A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE. TODAY THE GOVERNMENT RELEASED A PLAN ON HOW THEY WOULD , A LOOSE PLAN ON HOW THEY WOULD DISTRIBUTION , DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINE. WOULD YOU GO WITH A COURT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUT IN PLACE? THEY HAVE NOT PUT ONE OFFICIAL IN PLACE, WHAT I WOULD DO IS MAKE SURE FROM ALL OF THE EXPERTS TO MAKE SURE WHAT IS THE MOST RATIONAL MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF VACCINES BEING WORKED ON NOW, ONE IS AN RNA MODEL THAT ARE DONE BY TWO OF THE OPERATIONS I THINK MODERNITY AND , MERGENER , MODERNA AND THE OTHER CHANGES THE CELL STRUCTURE. ONE DEALS WITH THE MRNA, THAT REQUIRES TWO INJECTIONS AND REQUIRES TO BE STORED AT 70 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THIS, THERE ARE MECHANICAL ISSUES AS TO HOW AND WHERE THE VACCINE IS , LET'S SAY THE MATERNAL ONE IS PICKS, ASSUMING THAT THE VACCINE IS APPROVED, IT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM OF HOW YOU DISTRIBUTE THAT VACCINE. YOU HAVE TO SHIP IT IN BULK IF IT IS THE MRNA VERSION. THAT MEANS THOUSANDS AT A TIME KIND OF THING, IT WILL GO TO HOSPITALS AND MAJOR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. IT IS NOT GOING TO GO TO YOUR DOCTOR. MY , IT WILL NOT BE LIKE YOUR FLU SHOT, I GOT MY FLU SHOT AT WALGREENS, YOU COULD NOT DO THAT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO IT IN SMALL LOTS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE TWO SHOTS. MY GENERIC POINT IS THERE ARE A LOT OF NOT ONLY WHAT IS SAFE TO DO, BUT DISTRIBUTION ISSUES THAT ARE CONSEQUENTIAL AND MATTER A LOT. IT IS NOT LIKE IF I TOLD YOU TOMORROW, IF I WERE PRESIDENT AND SAID WE HAVE APPROVED THE FOLLOWING TWO VACCINES OR ONE VACCINE. THE VACCINES LIKELY TO BE APPROVED SO FAR STARTED OFF WITH A GROUP OF 10,000 DOSES ALL THE WAY TO 60,000 DOSES. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. IT TAKES TIME IS WHAT I AM SAYING. IT HAS TO BE DONE FAIRLY AND WELL. IT CANNOT BE BASED ON YOUR TAX RETURNS FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING, IT HAS GOT TO BE BASED ON WHO IS MOST VULNERABLE. THANK YOU ALSO VERY VERY MUCH, THANK YOU. THOSE COMMENTS FROM JOE BIDEN TOOK PLACE THIS AFTERNOON, AFTER THAT EVENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP HELD A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. HE RESPONDED TO JOE BIDEN AND IT SAID A COVID-19 VACCINE WILL BE READY BY MID-OCTOBER.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?475890-1\/joe-biden-remarks-covid-19-vaccine-development","Summary":"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, while speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, said health experts were warning of a coronavirus spike in November.

THE FIRST DAY OF MAIL-IN BALLOT IS FOR MINNESOTANS IN THE 2020 ELECTION. HE WAS INTRODUCED BY SENATOR TINA SMITH AND AMY KLOBUCHAR. THIS IS 40 MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE. I AM GLAD TO BE WITH YOU ALL. I THANK THE COMFORTERS TO WELCOME US TO THIS AMAZING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE. WE ARE ALL HERE BECAUSE WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO COME TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY, TO ORGANIZE FOR BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS, BETTER WAGES, SAFER PLACES TO WORK THEY DO BETTER AND THEIR FAMILIES TO BETTER AND EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY DOES BETTER. WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM TALKING TO HARD-WORKING PEOPLE ALL OVER MINNESOTA IS THAT WHAT THEY WANT IS THE FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THE LIVES THAT THEY WANT AND THEY KNOW THAT GOOD JOBS AND THEIR LABOR UNION HELP THEM DO THAT. SO I THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IN THIS AMAZING A , APPRENTICESHIP FACILITY THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS HAD A CHANCE TO TOUR THE DISTANT GREAT WORK IS CREATING PATHWAYS FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE GOOD JOBS AND GOOD CAREERS WITH PENSIONS AND THIS IS WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR MAKING THIS COUNTRY WORK AND MAKING PEOPLE'S LIVES WORK. WE KNOW WHAT TO DO TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY WORK FOR EVERYBODY AND NOT JUST THOSE THAT ARE AT THE TOP. INVOLVES MAKING SURE WAGES ARE GOOD. WE NEED A $15 HOUR MINIMUM WAGE AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE PAID FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE WORK HARD AND THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON THEIR PENSIONS BEING THERE WHEN THEY RETIRE. THIS IS A REAL CHALLENGE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THESE DAYS. I'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE IN DULUTH WHO HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT. WORKED ON WEEKENDS, WORK ON HOLIDAYS, PAID INTO THEIR PENSION, AND ARE NOW BEING TOLD THE PENSIONS MIGHT NOT BE THERE. THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS. A WOMAN SAID TO ME \"I DON'T HAVE A PLAN B, I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER THING TO DO HERE.\" ONE THING I AM PROUD TO STAND WITH VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN ON, AND SENATOR KLOBUCHAR, STANDING UP FOR THE RIGHT FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THE PENSIONS THEY EARNED. IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION, THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT WHO IS STANDING WITH WORKING PEOPLE IN MINNESOTA AND ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. THAT'S WHERE I STAND. A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID I THINK THE CAMPAIGN WHETHER YOU ARE FROM SCRANTON OR PARK AVENUE. IS THIS ABOUT SCRANTON OR PARK AVENUE? I KNOW WHAT SIDE I COME DOWN. I COME DOWN ON SCRANTON AND ON THE SIDE OF VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. SO THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I'M EXCITED TO BE A PART OF THE CELEBRATION OF THE HARD WORK AND WHAT THAT HARDWARE CAN DELIVER FOR FAMILIES IN TERMS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD THE LIVES THEY WANT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] HELLO EVERYONE, IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE HERE. THANK YOU TO THE CARPENTERS FOR HOSTING US. TO MY FRIEND TINA SMITH, WHO'S DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB. I'M SO PROUD TO HAVE HER AS A COLLEAGUE AND A REAL FRIEND. PEOPLE SAY FRIEND IN WASHINGTON ALL THE TIME BUT FOR US IT IS TRUE. AND ALSO TO BE HERE AND WELCOME BACK VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN TO NORTHERN MINNESOTA. HE HAS BEEN HERE WITH ME. HE HAS BEEN UP HERE WITH OUR STEELWORKERS. HE IS BEEN UP HERE BECAUSE YOU , HE HAS BEEN UP HERE BECAUSE HE DID DID SUCH GREAT WORK ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CAME TO DULUTH TO TALK ABOUT IT AND NOW HE IS HERE WITH THE CARPENTERS. I WAS JUST TALKING TO THE VICE PRESIDENT BACKSTAGE AND RECOUNTING MY BACKGROUND HERE. I THINK YOU ALL KNOW MY DAD GREW UP IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA, MY GRANDPA WAS A MINER. HE WORKED 1500 FEET UNDERGROUND HIS ENTIRE LIFE. HE NEVER GOT TO GRADUATE FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE HE HAD NINE BROTHERS AND SISTERS. IT WAS UNIONS THAT MADE MY GRANDPA'S LIFE SAFER. MY DAD STILL REMEMBERS THOSE BODIES IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AT SAINT ANTHONY'S BECAUSE IT WAS NOT SAFE. EVEN WHEN MY DEBT WAS GOING UP , EVEN WHEN MY DAD WAS GROWING UP, THAT WAS HAPPENING. THE UNIONS PUSHED FOR SAFER RULES AND BETTER WAGES. IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY REASONS AND STANDING UP HERE TODAY. SO WE KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY WHERE WE NEED SOMEONE TO HAVE OUR BACK. I AM SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING DONALD TRUMP SAY THAT HE IS SOMEHOW MAKING US MORE SAFE. WE ARE NOT SAFE WHEN WE HAVE A PANDEMIC RAGING ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, WHERE I GO VISIT MY DAD, WHO IS 92 AT ASSISTED LIVING, AND HE HAS COVID AND I'M LOOKING AT HIM THROUGH A GLASS DOOR LIKE I WAS TWO MONTHS AGO, AND I DON'T KNOW IF I'M EVER GOING TO SEE HIM AGAIN. THAT IS NOT SAFE. AND IT'S NOT SAFE WHEN PEOPLE ARE SCARED ECONOMICALLY AND THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THEIR JOB BACK. WHAT I LOVE ABOUT JOE BIDEN AND MY FRIEND, KAMALA HARRIS, IS THEY ARE LOOKING AT NOT JUST HOW WE GET THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO TRAIN OUR WORKERS. WHAT JOBS WE HAVE AVAILABLE NOW AND WHAT JOBS WE HAVE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL FIGHT FOR THOSE WHO LOST THEIR JOBS, BECAUSE THIS ADMINISTRATION IS SELLING AMERICAN WORKERS OUT WHEN WE NEED TO BUY AMERICAN. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE AND WORKERS OF NORTHERN MINNESOTA AND NOT GO DOWN TO THE MAR-A-LAGO AND TELL ALL OF HIS RICH FRIENDS AFTER HE PASSES THE TAX BILL THAT YOU JUST GOT A LOT RICHER. I DON'T THINK ONE PERSON FROM NORTHERN MINNESOTA WAS IN THAT ROOM IN FLORIDA WHEN HE SAID THAT. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS WE DO NOT HAVE A SHORTAGE OF CEOS. WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF PLUMBERS. A SHORTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT BUILD THINGS. THAT REALLY BUILD THINGS. JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO BE A PRESIDENT FOR ALL OF AMERICA. I WAS SO PROUD TO ENDORSE HIM AFTER STARTING MY CAMPAIGN IN THE MIDDLE OF A BLIZZARD IN MINNESOTA. I GOT TO END IT BY ENDORSING JOE BIDEN. I CANNOT THINK OF A MORE JOYFUL WAY TO END A CAMPAIGN. ONE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY. IT WAS THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION THAT CAME UP HERE IN THE FACE OF DENNIS MCDONOUGH, THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND MADE SURE WE DID SOMETHING ABOUT CHINESE STEEL DUMPING. THEY WENT TO WORK, ENFORCED THE LAWS, WE PASSED NEW LAWS, AND THE NUMBER OF OUR IRON ORE MINES REOPENED. IT WAS THERE ADMINISTRATION THAT GOT RESULTS. SO IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR JOB, YOU'VE GOT A HOME WITH JOE BIDEN. IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR CHILDCARE, YOU'VE GOT A HOME WITH JOE BIDEN. AND IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE DIVIDE IN THIS COUNTRY AND HAVING A PRESIDENT THAT JUST KEEPS ADDING MORE FUEL TO THE FLAMES, YOU'VE GOT A HOME WITH JOE BIDEN. BECAUSE HE WAKES UP EVERY MORNING AND THANKS HOW CAN I LEAD THIS COUNTRY AND BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER? LUCKILY, JUST LIKE THE CARPENTERS, WE ARE NOT AFRAID TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES. I HAVE THIS VOTE MASK BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST DAY OF EARLY VOTING AND MINNESOTA. SO LET'S GO OUT THERE, LET'S VOTE, LET'S ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES, AND GET TO WORK AND ELECT JOE BIDEN AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (music) THANK YOU, I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU ALL TO THE CARPENTER TRAINING INSTITUTE. OUR MISSION IS TO PREPARE OUR REGISTERED APPRENTICES , 2500 REGISTERED APPRENTICES FOR SUCCESSFUL CAREER AS A PROFESSOR OF PROFESSIONAL IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. WE ALSO PROVIDE CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR ALL OF OUR MEMBERSHIP. OUR PARTNER CONTRACTORS RELY ON THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OUR PROGRAMS AND OUR MEMBERS IN ORDER TO THRIVE. ON BEHALF OF THE NORTH-CENTRAL STATE REGIONAL COUNCIL OF CARPENTERS, THE CARPENTERS TRAINING INSTITUTE AND OUR MEMBERSHIP, I WOULD LIKE TO THINK VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT THE UBC MEMBERS IN OUR REGION DO AND ALSO HEAR WHAT ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT TO US. WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. (music) HELLO, MINNESOTA. IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK. AS AMY WAS SAYING, I HAVE BEEN HERE A NUMBER OF TIMES UP IN THE IRON RANGE AND IS IN A MAGNIFICENT PART OF THE WORLD. A MAGNIFICENT PART OF THE WORLD. I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH, AMY AND SENATOR. YOU HAVE BEEN A GREAT FRIEND AND A GREAT, GREAT SENATOR AND SENATOR SMITH, YOU ARE SOMETHING ELSE. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT. THANK YOU FOR THE JOB YOU'RE DOING AND I'M COUNTING ON IT TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER SIX YEARS. I KNOW YOU ARE BOTH FIGHTING AROUND-THE CLOCK TO TAKE CARE OF MINNESOTANS WHO ARE HURTING IN THESE MULTIPLE CRISES WE FACE TODAY. WE HAVE EVERYTHING FROM COVID TO UNEMPLOYMENT TO A COUNTRY THAT IS DIVIDED ALONG OR IS BEING DIVIDED ALONG RACIST LINES AND WE HAVE INSTITUTIONAL RACISM WE ARE DEALING WITH, A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS. THE PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TWO OF THE BEST SENATORS IN THE COUNTRY ON THEIR SIDE. MATT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INTRODUCTION AND FOR SHOWING ME AROUND TODAY. THIS INCREDIBLE APPRENTICE PROGRAM AT THE CARPENTERS TRAINING CENTER. WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW IF THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED WITH LABOR IS THAT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IS NOT ONLY TRAINING THE BEST WORKERS IN THE WORLD AND I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS, THAT IS A FACT. BUT THEY GET PAID WHILE THEY ARE DOING IT. THEY ARE GETTING PAID , NOT FOR FULL WAGES, BUT THEY'RE GETTING PAID WHILE THEY ARE DOING IT AND THAT IS WHY THESE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE SO SO SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY STAY THIS WAY. IT MATTERS. PEOPLE CAN STILL MAKE IT WHILE THEY ARE LEARNING A TRADE. A TRADE THAT WILL PUT THEM IN GOOD STEAD FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. IT WAS GREAT TO SEE SOME OF THE PRACTICAL HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE THAT APPRENTICES AND JOURNEYMEN AND WOMEN HERE RECEIVE. AS I SAID, WHILE EARNING A WAGE AS A BENEFIT. IT IS A BIT QUIETER HERE THAN USUAL BECAUSE OF COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS, BUT THE PRIDE OF THESE WORKERS WHO ARE LEARNING THE SKILLS THAT WILL CARRY THEM THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREERS IS STILL UNMISTAKABLE. MY FATHER , I APOLOGIZE TO THE PRESS WHO FOLLOWED ME FOR REPEATING THIS, BUT IT WARRANTS SAYING EVERY TIME, MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. HE SAID JOEY IN JOBS BY A LOT MORE THAN PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT YOUR RESPECT. YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. LOOKING A KID IN THE EYE AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE OK AND MEAN IT WAS THAT IS THE LESSON I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN. IT IS THE WAY I GREW UP SURROUNDED BY HARD-WORKING FAMILIES IN SCRANTON PENNSYLVANIA AND A LOT OF STEELWORKERS IN DELAWARE AND ALL THOSE JOBS ARE GONE NOW. A LOT OF THOSE JOBS ARE GONE NOW, THOUGH STILL WORKING JOBS. AND THAT IS WHAT I SAW HERE THIS TRAINING CENTER. DEDICATED WOMEN AND MEN INVESTING IN THEIR DIGNITY. IN THEIR DIGNITY. HERE IN THE IRON RANGE, WE CAN SEE THE RESILIENCE IN THE GRIP OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BUILT AMERICA, THE METAL THAT IT IS MADE OF, AND FORTIFIED BY THE STRENGTH OF UNION POWER, WORKER POWER. I THINK I WAS SAYING TO YOU, MATT, THAT MY DAD HAS ANOTHER EXPRESSION. THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE OF POWER IS WITH POWER AND THE ONLY WERE REAL POWER FOR WORKERS IN AMERICA IS UNION POWER. YOU ARE THE PEOPLE THAT KEEP THE BARBARIANS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GATE AND MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN MAKE A DECENT LIVING. FOLKS, HERE LIKE EVERYWHERE ELSE, TIMES ARE HARD. UNEMPLOYMENT IS WAY UP DUE TO THE PANDEMIC, FEW WORKERS CAN BE ON THE JOB AT ONE TIME IN ORDER TO ABIDE BY SOCIAL DISTANCING RULES, AND THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR NEXT YEAR INCLUDING FOR THE BUILDING TRADES IS MORE UNCERTAIN THAN IT NEED BE. HERE IN MINNESOTA AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE HURTING. THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING THE NEXT MORTGAGE PAYMENT. THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT KEEPING THE RENT PAYMENTS IN CHECK. THEY SEE THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THE HEAP DOING VERY WELL. AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER. BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA DURING THIS PANDEMIC HAVE MADE ANOTHER $300 BILLION. DID YOU HEAR WHAT I JUST SAID? IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. YOU ARE LEFT TO WONDER AS THE CONSEQUENCE, WHO IS LOOKING OUT FOR THE ORDINARY FOLKS? THAT IS BEEN THE ENTIRE STORY OF DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. NOW IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNPRECEDENTED NATIONAL CRISIS DONALD TRUMP HAS GIVEN UP ON EVEN PRETENDING TO DO HIS JOB. ALMOST 200,000 LIVES LOST IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND EXPERTS TELL US NOW THE SAME STUDIES THAT WE RELIED ON, THE ADMINISTRATION RELIED ON TO PREDICT WHAT'S COMING NEXT, THAT WE WILL LOSE ANOTHER 215,000 LIVES BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY 1. THE UNITED STATES HAS LOST , HAS ANOTHER 36,000 NEW COVID CASES PER DAY. PER DAY. ANOTHER AVERAGE 1000 DEATHS A DAY. JUST ACROSS THE BORDER, AND FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING, A STONE'S THROW INDICATED THAT, ONE DAY EARLIER THIS MONTH THE UNITED STATES THE UNITED STATES HAD A , HAD 1000 DEATHS OF COVID, AND CANADA HAD ZERO. JUST THREE DAYS AGO, I BELIEVE IT WAS, AMERICA HAD 1200 DEATHS, CANADA HAD NINE. NINE. SO MANY LIVES LOST UNNECESSARILY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS ONLY WORRIED ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET AND HIS REELECTION. HE REFUSED TO DO WHAT YOU ARE DOING RIGHT HERE IN THIS PROGRAM. SOCIAL DISTANCE, WEAR MASKS, SANITIZE. YOU'RE PROTECTING YOUR APPRENTICES. HE IS NOT PROTECTING AMERICA. IT IS ESTIMATED BY THE SCIENTISTS THAT IF WE JUST WORE MASKS NATIONALLY, WE WOULD SAVE 100,000 LIVES BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY 1. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. IF WE JUST WORE MASKS NATIONALLY, WE WOULD SAVE 100,000 LIVES BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY ACCORDING TO THE SAME STUDY. IT WAS ESTIMATED BY GREAT MEDICAL SCHOOL, THE COLUMBIA MEDICAL SCHOOL, THAT IF THE PRESIDENT HAD JUST STARTED ONE WEEK EARLIER IN MARCH THEN HE DID, WE WOULD HAVE 36,000 MORE PEOPLE SITTING AT THE DINNER TABLE TONIGHT. OR BEING ABLE TO PUT YOUR ARM AROUND GRAMPA OR GRANDMA TONIGHT. AGAIN, IN HIS OWN WORDS, RECORDED BY BOB WOODWARD, THE PRESIDENT KNEW BACK IN FEBRUARY THAT THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, COMMUNICABLE DISEASE. THINK ABOUT IT. HOW MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE IRON RANGE, HOW MANY EMPTY CHAIRS AROUND THOSE DINNER TABLES, BECAUSE OF HIS NEGLIGENCE AND SELFISHNESS? HOW MANY LIES SAID AND LIVES LOST? IMAGINE IF HE HAD JUST, AT THE STATE OF THE UNION THAT YEAR SPOKE UP AND SAID WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND WE CAN HANDLE IT AND HERE'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. I CANNOT THINK OF ANY PRESIDENT WHO HAS EVER ACTED, IN MY VIEW, SO SELFISHLY ABOUT HIS OWN REELECTION INSTEAD OF HIS SWORN OBLIGATION TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AS I SAID LAST NIGHT IN MY HOMETOWN, I VIEW THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BETWEEN , AS BETWEEN SCRANTON AND PARK AVENUE. ALL TRUMP SEES FROM PARK AVENUE IS WALL STREET. THAT IS WHY THE ONLY METRIC OF THE AMERICAN PRESS FOR HIM IS THE VALUE OF THE DOW JONES. LIKE A LOT OF US BUT A LOT OF MY LIFE WITH GUYS LIKE DONALD TRUMP LOOKING DOWN ON ME. LOOKING DOWN THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE A LIVING WITH OUR HANDS, PEOPLE WHO TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS. PEOPLE WHO CLEAN OUR STREETS. MAYBE WHAT BOTHERS ME MOST IS THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT, IS REPORTED TO TALK ABOUT, AND CONFIRMED BY MANY OUTLETS. WHERE HE IS TALKED ABOUT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO JOIN THE MILITARY AND GAVE FULL MEASURE TO THEIR COUNTRY AS SUCKERS AND LOSERS. UNLESS YOU THINK IT IS MADE UP, REMEMBER HOW HE TALKED ABOUT JOHN MCCAIN. A POLITICAL OPPONENT, BUT A CLOSE FRIEND AND I GAVE HIS EULOGY. JOHN MCCAIN WAS NO SUCKER OR LOSER. HE WAS A HERO. MY SON WHO VOLUNTEERED TO SPEND A YEAR IN IRAQ AND WON THE BRONZE STAR. HE WASN'T A LOSER OR SUCKER. HE WAS A PROUD PATRIOT. THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE BETTER THAN ME, BETTER THAN US BECAUSE THEY HAD A LOT OF MONEY. GUYS WHO INHERIT EVERYTHING THEY'VE GOT AND STILL MANAGE TO SQUANDER IT. I HAVE TO ADMIT, WHICH I GUESS IS COMING OUT AND IT IS PRETTY OBVIOUS, PARTICULARLY RELATED TO TRUMP. I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CHIP ON MY SHOULDER ABOUT THESE GUYS. RECENTLY , I PROBABLY SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID THAT LAST NIGHT BUT I DID , RECENTLY, I READ SOME STORIES I WAS ASKED QUESTIONS BY LEADING COLUMNIST. IT WENT LIKE THIS. IF YOU GET ELECTED, YOU WILL BE THE FIRST GUY IN A LONG TIME ELECTED PRESIDENT WITHOUT AN IVY LEAGUE DEGREE. LIKE SOMEHOW, A KID WHO WENT TO THE STATE UNIVERSITY CAN QUALIFY TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT AN IVY LEAGUE DEGREE? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I KNOW HOW TO DO THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT. IT IS PRETTY CLEAR. NO MATTER HOW WEALTHY DONALD TRUMP IS OR HOW MUCH HE DOCTORS, IF HE DOES, HIS TAX RETURNS. HE DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE HOW TO BE PRESIDENT. ONE OF THE LESSONS MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME, NOT A JOKE, A LONG TIME AGO, TAUGHT ME AND MY SIBLINGS AND ONE THAT YOU WERE PROBABLY TAUGHT TO O , TOO OUT HERE IN MINNESOTA. SHE SAID JOEY, REMEMBER NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU BUT EVERYBODY IS YOUR EQUAL. NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU, BUT EVERYBODY IS YOUR EQUAL. WE DON'T MEASURE PEOPLE BY THE SIZE OF THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS. I DON'T RESPECT PEOPLE BASED ON HOW BIG THEIR HOUSE THEY LIVE IN IS. I DON'T LOOK DOWN MY NOSE AT PEOPLE WHO ARE BUSTING THEIR NECKS JUST MAKING A LIVING. TRUMP SAYS, BY THE WAY, EVERYBODY'S IN THE STOCK MARKET AND THAT'S WHY HE CARES ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET. WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING ABOUT? PEOPLE WHO I GREW UP WITH IN SCRANTON AND CLAYMONT DIDN'T HAVE MONEY IN STOCKS. EVERY PENNY WE MADE WAS TO PAY THE BILLS AND TAKE CARE OF THE FAMILIES. PUT CLOTHES ON THEIR BACK AND ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. IN THE MARKET? THAT IS WHY I HAVE A DIFFERENT MEASURE BY WHICH I JUDGE THE HEALTH OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. MY MEASURE IS SCRANTON, DULUTH, HERMANTOWN, PLACES WHERE I GREW UP AND SO MANY PEOPLE I KNOW GREW UP. I SEE HARD-WORKING WOMEN AND MEN JUST TRYING TO EARN AN HONEST DECENT LIVING AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES. THEY JUST HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONFIDENCE, A LITTLE BIT OF CONFIDENCE TO JUST SEE AROUND THE CORNER. THEY DON'T HAVE TO LIVE LITERALLY FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. MOST DO. BUT HOPE FOR A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE. NOW, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SEEING THESE WOMEN AND MEN, THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS, WORKERS WHO STOCK THE SHELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRISIS AND DRIVERS WHO DROVE THE TRUCKS AND DELIVER THE FOOD. FARMWORKERS, NURSES WHO RISK THEIR LIVES AND IN MANY CASES GAVE THEIR LIVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC TO SAVE OTHER PEOPLE. ESSENTIAL WORKERS. AND WHEN THEY WALK DOWN THE STREETS AND PEOPLE CAME OUT AND CLAP HANDS AND POTS TOGETHER TO TELL THEM HOW MUCH THEY ARE APPRECIATED, THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. THEY'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING. JUST ASKING FOR A SHOT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE NEVER EVER EVER LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN. SO IT'S ABOUT TIME WE START TO PAY ESSENTIAL WORKERS FOR THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ESSENTIAL. BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I THINK THEY ARE READY. THEY ARE READY TO INSIST THAT MINIMUM WAGE BE $15 AN HOUR. THEY ARE READY TO INSIST THAT PEOPLE HAVE CHILD CARE AND ACCESS TO IT. THERE READY TO ADMIT AND UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE , THAT AVERAGE AMERICANS HAVE. THAT IS WHY MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN, IN FACT MY ENTIRE CAMPAIGN, IS BUILT AROUND A SIMPLE COMPLEX. IT IS TIME TO REWARD HARD-WORKING AMERICA, NOT WEALTH. REWARD WORK, NOT WEALTH. WE SHOULD NOT PENALIZE WEALTH. IT IS NOT THE OPPOSITE NOW. RIGHT NOW, IT IS REWARD WEALTH AND NOT WORK. WE NEED TO REBUILD AN ECONOMY IN THE WAKE OF COVID-19 AND AS WE DO WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE LONG-OVERDUE INVESTMENTS FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WEALTHY, THE VERY WEALTHY AND THE BIG CORPORATIONS FINALLY BEGAN TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. NOT LOOKING TO PUNISH ANYBODY. JUST PAY YOUR FAIR SHARE. IT IS TIME WE GIVE HARD-WORKING FAMILIES WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY WITH THEIR SKILLS AND THEIR SWEAT AND THEIR BLOOD LIKE THE UNITED BROTHERHOOD OF CARPENTERS AND JOINERS, A LEG UP FOR ONCE. I HAVE A BIG, AMBITIOUS PLAN THAT BETS ON THE AMERICAN WORKER. MY PLAN IS GOING TO GREAT MILLIONS OF GOOD PLAYING JOBS. BUILDING THE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE NEED NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. IT STARTS WITH A PRETTY BASIC IDEA. WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS TAXPAYERS' MONEY WE SHOULD SPEND THAT MONEY TO BUY AMERICAN PRODUCTS, MADE BY AMERICAN WORKERS IN AN AMERICAN SUPPLY CHAIN TO GENERATE AMERICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY. MY PLAN WOULD TIGHTEN THE RULES TO MAKE BUY AMERICAN REALITY. DURING MY FIRST TERM ALONE, WE ARE GOING TO INVEST $400 BILLION OF FEDERAL MONEY THAT I HAVE CONTROL OVER IS THE PRESIDENT , AS THE PRESIDENT DURING ADMINISTRATION TO INVEST IN PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS OUR COUNTRY NEED TO MONITOR AND , NEEDS TO MODERNIZE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. TO REPLENISH CRITICAL STOCKPILES. TO ENHANCE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. I WAS JUST GOING THROUGH THE APPRENTICE PROGRAM WITH ONE OF YOUR CARPENTERS. HE WAS SHOWING ME HOW TO READ BLUEPRINTS AND I'M A FRUSTRATED ARCHITECT. I JUST LOVE , MY KIDS YEARS AGO BOUGHT ME A LIGHT BOARD. I HAVE NO PROFESSIONAL TRAINING. BUT I LIKE AND I CARRY AROUND GRAPH PAPER. I'M ALWAYS MAKING UP AND DESIGNING HOMES AND LANDSCAPES. THAT IS MY WAY OUT. SOME PEOPLE CAN PAINT, I CANNOT. HE WAS SHOWING ME THE BLUEPRINTS ON HOW THEY CAN CHANGE SEVERAL WALLS IN A PARTICULAR BUILDING TO CONSERVE AND SAVE ENERGY. AND HE POINTED OUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO BE ABLE TO READ A BLUEPRINT. I POINTED OUT TO HIM THAT MY BUY AMERICAN PLAN , HE SAID, BY THE WAY, NOT ME, THIS CARPENTER SAID THIS. HE SAID BY THE WAY WE CAN KILL TWO BIRDS OF ONE STONE. WE CAN DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE. HE SAID WE CAN IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT BY USING LESS ENERGY TO OPERATE THIS BUILDING AND CREATE MORE JOBS. I SAID I'M GOING TO SEND YOU A COPY OF MY PLAN. MY SENATE COLLEAGUES KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. MY BUY AMERICAN, BUILD AMERICAN PLAN CALLS FOR LITERALLY WHAT WE STARTED IN MY ADMINISTRATION AND COULD NOT FINISH, RETROFITTING 4 MILLION BUILDINGS IN AMERICA THAT ARE LEAKING MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF ENERGY NOW. IN THE PROCESS, CREATING THE 4 MILLION JOBS FOR SKILLED LABOR. REPLACING WINDOWS, INSULATION THAT WORKS. MAKING SURE THAT THE UNIT IS TIGHT, INCLUDING RETROFITTING 2 MILLION HOMES. ALL OF IT, DONE AT A PREVAILING WAGE WITH UNION LABOR. CREATING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF UNION CERTIFIED JOBS. THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE, THAT IS A FACT. THAT IS HOW IT WILL HAPPEN. AND SAVING MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF OIL IN THE PROCESS. IMPROVING OUR ENVIRONMENT. THAT IS WHY THE IBEW AND A LOT OF OTHER UNIONS SUPPORT WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE WILL PUT IN 500,000 CHARGING STATIONS ALONG OUR HIGHWAYS. WHY? SO WE CAN OWN, OWN, OWN, THE ELECTRIC CAR MARKET. ESTIMATED CREATING 1 MILLION NEW JOBS IN MICHIGAN AND DETROIT AND THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY. LOOK, WE COULD OUTCOMPETE ANYBODY IF WE SET OUR MIND TO IT. YOU KNOW, MY INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN IS GOING TO REVITALIZE AMERICAN INFRASTRUCTURE SO THE FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA. THE PRESIDENT KEEPS TALKING ABOUT HE'S GOING TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE, RIGHT? HOW MANY TIMES HAS HE SAID WHEN YOU ARE THERE HE HAS A PLAN. HE HAD ONE IN 2017, THAT IS COMING. THEN HE HAD ONE IN 2018, AND ANOTHER ONE IN 2019, AND NOW HE HAS ONE FOR 2020. JUST LIKE HIS NONEXISTENT HEALTHCARE PLAN THAT IS COMING NEXT WEEK. HE HAS NO PLAN. WHEN I GOT STARTED, THIS WAS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. DEALING WITH INFRASTRUCTURE. REPUBLICANS WANTED TO BUILD SOLID INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE US FIRST IN THE WORLD AND NOW WE RANK 28TH. JUST LIKE DEMOCRATS DID. IT WAS TOTALLY NONPARTISAN. AND CREATING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS. WE'RE GOING TO INVEST OVER TIME $2 TRILLION TO BUILD RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE, ROADS, BRIDGES, PORTS, RIGHT HERE ALONG THIS , THESE GREAT, GREAT LAKES. 1.5 MILLION NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND FOR EVERY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD. MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER AS WE EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN FROM HOME BECAUSE THERE'S NO PLAN ON HOW , HE HAS NO PLAN ON HOW TO OPEN OUR SCHOOLS. $100 BILLION TO REBUILD CRUMBLING SCHOOLS. HOW MANY SCHOOLS IN AMERICA DO YOU THINK THERE ARE WHERE YOU CANNOT SAFELY DRINK THE WATER FROM THE WATER FOUNTAIN? WERE THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ENOUGH VENTILATION IN THE SCHOOL? WHETHER THERE IS LEAKING ENERGY OR STILL HAS HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IN THE WALLS? IT IS RIDICULOUS. WE SHOULD BE SPENDING THE MONEY TO IMPROVE THOSE SCHOOLS FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR TEACHERS. AS I SAID, RETROFITTING 4 MILLION BUILDINGS AND WEATHERIZING 2 MILLION HOMES. THE WAY WE DO THAT IS WITH TAX CREDITS THAT WE GIVE THEM AGAIN. ALL DONE BY CERTIFIED UNION LABOR. LOOK, I'LL FIGHT FOR WORKERS AND UNIONS AT EVERY STEP WORKING ALL FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT TO ONE PAY PREVAILING WAGE TO . TWO, PRIORITIZE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS IN PLACE BEFORE THE PROJECT STARTS. EMPLOYEE WORKERS FROM REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIPS. I WILL NOT WATER THEM DOWN LIKE TRUMP TRIED TO DO. PAST THE PRO-ACT TO BLOCK , STOP EMPLOYERS WHO TRY TO BLOCK OR BREAK UNIONS. I WILL DO IT WITHOUT RAISING ANYONE'S TAXES. IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN 400,000 YEAR. IF YOU MAKE MORE, YOU'RE GOING TO START PAYING YOUR FAIR SHARE. NOBODY WHO MAKES LESS THAN $40,000 WILL PAY A SINGLE PENNY MORE IN TAXES UNDER ADMINISTRATION. IN FACT, TENS OF MILLIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WILL GET TAX CUTS WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST. WHILE YOU'RE RAISING YOUR CHILDREN AND TRYING TO GET AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE OR BUYING YOUR FIRST HOME OR SAVING FOR RETIREMENT. ALMOST DIRECTLY AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP PASSED HIS TAX BILL IN 2017, ALMOST $2 TRILLION INCREASE IN THE DEFICIT. HE WENT DOWN TO MAR-A-LAGO AND HE SAID TO HIS GUESTS THERE THIS IS A QUOTE ON RECORD, \"YOU JUST GOT A LOT RICHER.\" HE'S RIGHT. YOU JUST GOT A LOT RICHER. WHAT ABOUT THE PERSON MAKING , HOW MUCH DID YOU GET? HOW MUCH RICHER DID YOU GET? MAYBE THE ONLY TIME HE IS TOLD THE PLAIN TRUTH IN HIS ENTIRE PRESIDENCY. IN 2018, THE YEAR AFTER THAT TAX CUT PASSED 91 CORPORATIONS IN THE FORTUNE 500 PAID NO INCOME TAX. ZERO TAX, ZERO. MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, PAID ZERO TAX. I GUESS YOU GUYS GOT ALL OF YOUR TAXES ELIMINATED TOO, RIGHT? HE SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE THE LOWEST, GOING TO LOWER THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. GUESS WHAT. INSTEAD, BIG PHARMA CUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX CUTS, SENT THEIR MANUFACTURE THOSE DRUGS OVERSEAS AND THEN UNCONSCIONABLY RAISED THE PRICE TO ORDINARY AMERICANS. HOW MANY OF YOU PEOPLE KNEW YOUR MOTHERS, FATHERS, UNCLES, AUNTS, FRIENDS WHO HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GETTING A PRESCRIPTION, NOT A JOKE, AND PUTTING DINNER ON THE TABLE. NOW HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO CUT DRUG PRICES. LIKE HE'S GOING TO HAVE A HEALTHCARE PLAN. ALL HE HAS DONE, THIS BIG THING ABOUT HE IS CALLING THE DRUG PRICES CUT. ALL HE IS DONE, HE SENT TO THE HHS, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, HE SAID STUDY THE ISSUE. I HAVE A CLEAR PLAN. I GUARANTEE I'LL LOWER PRICES IN AMERICA FOR DRUGS BY ALLOWING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE THE PRICES WHICH HE SAID HE WOULD DO. THE HOUSE AND SENATE WERE READY TO DO IT AND HE SAID HE WOULD VETO IT IF HE GOT IT. IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM YOU HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH MEDICARE FOR THE PRICE OF THAT DRUG. TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PRICES. AND FOR ANY NEW SPECIALTY DRUGS THAT DON'T HAVE COMPETITION THAT ARE LAUNCHED, I'M SETTING UP A REVIEW BOARD TO RECOMMEND A REASONABLE PRICE BASED ON THE BOARD'S EVALUATION. AND THAT PRICE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE INCREASED BEYOND THE COST OF MEDICAL INFLATION UNLESS THEY CAN PROVE THAT THEY'VE GONE AND DONE SOME MORE RESEARCH AND CHANGED THE NATURE OF THE DRUG. AND NOW ASTONISHINGLY, AND WITH , WHEN MY STAFF TOLD ME THIS, I KNOW BOTH THE SENATORS DO THIS, BUT WHEN THEY TOLD ME THIS I SAID HE CANNOT BE PROPOSING THIS. HE NOW IS PROPOSING, IN THIS BUDGET, ANOTHER MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR CUT TAX FOR THE VERY WEALTHY MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES. HERE'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. HE WANTS TO LOWER THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX DOWN TO 15%. TO 15%. EVERYONE OF YOU, INCLUDING THE REPORTERS IN THIS ROOM, UNLESS YOU ARE MAKING A LOT MORE THAN I THINK YOU WERE, EVERYONE OF YOU IS GOING TO BE PAYING AT A HIGHER TAX RATE THAN SOMEONE MAKING $1 BILLION OFF THEIR INVESTMENT. YOU'RE GOING TO PAY A HIGHER TAX RATE. BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY BY INVESTING, NOT BY THE SWEAT OF THEIR BROW. ANOTHER TAX CUT WORTH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND WHO, WHOSE HIDE DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF. WHERE DOES IT COME FROM? THE DEFICIT IS ALREADY BONKERS. WHERE DO YOU THINK IT IS GOING TO COME OUT OF? IT IS GOING TO COME OUT OF YOU AND THE PROGRAMS AND THE THINGS THAT HELP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . LIKE I SAID, IT'S ABOUT TIME WE START REWARDING WORK AND NOT WEALTH. I'M NOT LOOKING TO PUNISH ANYONE. BUT, DAMMIT, IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT THE SUPER WEALTHY AND CORPORATE AMERICA START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. THAT IS ALL. JUST PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. SO HARD-WORKING FAMILIES CAN CERTAINLY BREAK ON ELDERLY CARE, CHILD CARE, BUYING THE FIRST HOME, THE COST OF EDUCATION BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL, BEING ABLE TO GET STARTED IN LIFE. BY THE WAY, WHILE ALL THIS IS GOING ON, DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO RIP AWAY YOUR HEALTHCARE. THIS WHOLE THING, SAYING HE HAS A NEW HEALTHCARE PROGRAM AND PROTECT CONDITIONS. HE IS IN THE SUPREME COURT SAYING GET RID OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAND IN THE WAY OF YOU GETTING INSURANCE BECAUSE IT HELPS INSURANCE COMPANIES. AND AS A GIMMICK, HE HAS A NEW ONE. HE IS GOING TO END THE PAYROLL TAX THAT YOU PAY ON SOCIAL SECURITY. YET THE ACTUARY AT THE SOCIAL SECURITY SAYS IF THAT WERE TO OCCUR, SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE BANKRUPT BY THE MIDDLE OF 2023. YOU MAY GET A FEW MORE BUCKS ON YOUR PAYCHECK AND THEN GO HOME AND TELL YOUR MOM AND DAD SOCIAL SECURITY IS ABOUT TO COME TO AN END. THEY NEVER LIKED SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE TO BEGIN WITH. SO LOOK, WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN. LET SOCIAL SECURITY RUN DRY BY 2023. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE HAVE NEVER EVER EVER EVER BEEN UNABLE TO DO SOMETHING WHEN WE'VE DONE IT TOGETHER. NEVER. SO IT IS TIME TO STAND UP, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. I SAID ITS LAST NIGHT AND THE CALLINGS I KNOW, SOME DEMOCRATS GET MAD THIS. I'M RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT. BUT I'M GOING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES NOT PRESIDENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE'VE'VE GOT TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY. I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE READY FOR IT. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO TAKE HIM ON BECAUSE HE'S SO VINDICTIVE, THEY ARE READY TO WORK. IT IS TIME TO TAKE THE COUNTRY BACK, FOLKS. AND IT'S GOING TO START HERE. TODAY, WITH VOTING IN MINNESOTA. SO GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

REGARDING THE NOMINATION FOR THE SUPREME COURT, THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT IF CHUCK SCHUMER WERE THE MAJORITY LEADER IN 2016 THAT MAYOR GARLAND WOULD BE ON THE COURT RIGHT NOW, SO THERE IS NO DISPUTING THAT. NUMBER TWO, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD FIND THIS INTERESTING, YOU KNOW, THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN PLAYING A CLIP OF JOE BIDEN SAYING THAT \"WE BELIEVE IN TRUTH AND NOT FACTS,\" AND THEY ARE SAYING IT IS A GAFFE. I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS A GAFFE, I BELIEVE IT WAS A FREUDIAN SLIP. GOOD AFTERNOON. WELCOME TO THE CONSTITUTION CENTER. I HAVE THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF BEING A GUEST HERE. IT IS A PERFECT PLACE TO MAKE A SPEECH I'M ABOUT TO MAKE. I ATTENDED NASA EARLIER TODAY AND PRAYED FOR JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG AND HER FAMILY. THE NATION LOST AN ICON. THEY ALSO LOST A GRANDMOTHER AND MATRIARCH. WE KNOW HOW HARD THAT IS, TO WATCH A PIECE OF YOUR SOUL ABSORB THE CRUELTY AND PAIN OF THE DREADFUL DISEASE OF CANCER. I SPOKE TO HER DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTER LAST NIGHT, EXPRESSING ME AND MY WHOLE FAMILY'S SORROW, PARTICULARLY MY GROWN GRANDDAUGHTERS, ONE OF WHOM WAS A STUDENT OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG'S DAUGHTER. THEY MAKE CLEAR TO ME, DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTER, THAT UNTIL THE VERY END JUSTICE GINSBURG DISPLAYED THE CHARACTER AND COURAGE YOU WOULD EXPECT OF HER. THEY SAID SHE HELD THEIR HANDS AND GIVE THEM STRENGTH AND PURPOSE TO CARRY ON. IT HAS BEEN NOTED THAT SHE PASSED AWAY ON ROSH HASHANAH. BY TRADITION, A PERSON WHO DIES DURING THE JEWISH NEW YEAR IS CONSIDERED A SOUL OF GREAT RIGHTEOUSNESS. THAT WAS RUTH BADER GINSBURG , A RIGHTEOUS SOUL. IT WAS MY GREAT HONOR WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, TO PRESIDE OVER HER CONFIRMATION HEARINGS AND STRONGLY SUPPORT HER ASCENSION TO THE SUPREME COURT AND. JUSTICE GINSBURG ACHIEVED A STANDING A FEW JUSTICES HAVE OR EVER WILL. SHE BECAME A PRESENCE IN THE LIVES OF SO MANY AMERICANS. I AGREE WITH WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID. SHE DID AS MUCH TO ADVANCE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, OPPORTUNITIES, AND JUSTICE FOR WOMEN AS JUSTICE MARSHALL DID FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS. YES, THERE WAS HUMOR IN MENTIONS OF THE NOTORIOUS RBG AND HER IMPRESSIVE EXERCISE ROUTINES, BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE. SHE WAS , TO USE AN OVERUSED WORD , A TRAILBLAZER. A ROLE MODEL. A SOURCE OF HOPE AND A POWERFUL VOICE FOR JUSTICE. SHE WAS PROOF THAT COURAGE AND CONVICTION AND MORAL CLARITY CAN CHANGE NOT ONLY THE LAW, IT CAN CHANGE OUR CULTURE , IT CAN CHANGE THE WORLD. I BELIEVE IN THE DATE , THE DAYS AND MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD , EXCUSE ME , SHE WILL CONTINUE TO INSPIRE AMERICANS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND TOGETHER WE CAN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A VOICE FOR JUSTICE IN HER NAME. HER GRANDDAUGHTER SAID YESTERDAY , AND SAID PUBLICLY, THAT HER DYING WORDS WERE, \"MY MOST FERVENT WISH IS THAT I NOT BE REPLACED UNTIL A NEW PRESIDENT IS INSTALLED.\" AS A NATION, WE SHOULD HEAT HER FINAL CALL, NOT AS A PERSONAL SERVICE TO HER, BUT AS A SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY, OUR COUNTRY, AT A CROSSROADS. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. THE RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE, CLEAN AIR, CLEAN WATER, THE ENVIRONMENT, EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, THE RIGHTS OF VOTERS, IMMIGRANTS, WOMEN, WORKERS. AND RIGHT NOW OUR COUNTRY FACES A CHOICE. A CHOICE ABOUT WHETHER WE WILL COME BACK FROM THE BRINK. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT FOR A FEW MINUTES TODAY. WITHIN AN HOUR OF THE NEWS OF HER PASSING, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINEE TO REPLACE JUSTICE GINSBURG WOULD RECEIVE A VOTE IN THE SENATE. WITHIN ONE HOUR OF HER PASSING. THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE SAID WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHEN HE NOMINATED MAREK TO REPLACE JUSTICE SCALIA IN 2016. AT THAT TIME, MAJORITY MCCONNELL MADE UP THE RULE BASED ON THE FICTION THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO NOMINATION IN AN ELECTION YEAR TO THE COURT. THAT IS RIDICULOUS. THE ONLY RULE I EVER FOLLOWED RELATED TO THAT WAS THE CONSTITUTION'S OBLIGATION FOR SENATORS TO PROVIDE THEIR ADVICE AND THEIR CONSENT TO A PRESIDENTS JUDICIAL NOMINEE. BUT HE CREATED A NEW RULE, THE MCCONNELL RULE. ABSOLUTELY NO HEARING, NO VOTE, FOR A NOMINEE IN AN ELECTION YEAR. . PERIOD. NO CAVEATS. MANY REPUBLICAN SENATORS AGREED WITH HIM, INCLUDING THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AT THE TIME. INCLUDING THE CURRENT CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, LINDSEY GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA. WHO AT THE TIME, SAID, \"I WANT YOU TO USE MY WORDS AGAINST ME IF THERE IS A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT IN 2016 AND A VACANCY OCCURS IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE FIRST TERM. YOU CAN SAY, LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID, LET THE NEXT PRESIDENT, WHOEVER IT MIGHT BE, MAKE THE NOMINATION. AND YOU COULD USE MY WORDS AGAINST ME AND YOU WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.\" THAT IS WHAT REPUBLICAN SAID WHEN JUSTICE SCALIA PASSED AWAY. ABOUT NINE MONTHS BEFORE ELECTION DAY THAT YEAR. NOW, WE LOST JUSTICE GINSBURG ABOUT SEVEN WEEKS BEFORE AN ELECTION AND AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN CASTING THEIR VOTE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE 40% OF AMERICANS WILL HAVE VOTED BY THE FIRST. TENS OF MILLIONS. YOU CANNOT UNRING THE BELL. HAVING MADE THIS THE STANDARD, TO SERVE THEIR INTERESTS, THEY CANNOT FOUR YEARS LATER CHANGE COURSE WHEN IT DOES NOT SERVE THEIR ENDS. I AM NOT BEING NAIVE. I AM NOT SPEAKING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO WILL DO WHATEVER HE WANTS. I AM NOT SPEAKING TO MITCH MCCONNELL WHO WILL DO WHATEVER HE WANTS AND HE DOES. I AM SPEAKING TO REPUBLICANS OUT THERE, SENATE REPUBLICANS, WHO KNOW DEEP DOWN WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY AND CONSISTED WITH THE CONSTITUTION AS I STAND HERE IN THE CONSTITUTION CENTER. NOT JUST WHAT IS BEST FOR THEIR PARTY. I SPEAK FOR A MILLION AMERICANS , MILLIONS OF AMERICANS OUT THERE WHO ALREADY VOTED AND CONTINUE TO VOTE AND WILL HAVE MANY MORE BY THE TIME THE PROCESS IS FINISHED. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO VOTED BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR HEALTH CARE HANGS IN THE BALANCE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS IN LIVING MEMORY, TRUMP IS BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT TRYING TO STRIP HEALTH CARE FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF FAMILIES. MORE THAN 100 MILLION AMERICANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IF HE SUCCEEDS, ONCE AGAIN DISCRIMINATE OR DROP COVERAGE FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA, DIABETES, CANCER, AND SO MANY OTHER PROBLEMS. PERHAPS, MOST CRUELLY OF ALL, IF DONALD TRUMP HAS HIS WAY, COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID-19, WHICH ARE WELL BEYOND WHAT THEY SHOULD BE, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 200 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE DIED , 200,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED BY THE TIME I FINISH THIS TALK. BUT LUNG AND HEART DAMAGE COULD BECOME THE NEXT DENIABLE PRE-EXISTING CONDITION FOR OVER 6 MILLION AMERICANS WHO ALREADY CONTRACTED THE DISEASE. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE VOTING ALSO BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT NEARLY HALF A CENTURY OF LEGAL PRECEDENT OVERTURNED. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE. MILLIONS OF DREAMERS WHO ARE AT RISK OF BEING EXPELLED FROM THE ONLY COUNTRY THEY HAVE EVER KNOWN. MILLIONS OF WORKERS, UNION WORKERS, WHO ARE AT RISK OF YOU , LOSING THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO ARE DEMANDING THEIR VOICES BE HEARD, THAT EQUAL JUSTICE BE A GUARANTEE FOR ALL, NOT JUST SOME. THEY KNOW WE ALL KNOW WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NOW. VOTERS IN THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE HEARD. VOTING HAS ALREADY BEGUN. BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER, THERE WILL BE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS WHO ALREADY VOTED. IN JUST A FEW WEEKS, ALL VOTES IN THE NATION WILL BE HEARD. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD DECIDE WHO HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE THIS APPOINTMENT. IT IS NOT ABOUT THE PAST. IT IS ABOUT THE FUTURE. THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION. THEY ARE CHOOSING THEIR FUTURE RIGHT NOW. AS THEY VOTE. TO JAM THE NOMINATION THROUGH THE SENATE IS JUST AN EXERCISE IN RAW POLITICAL POWER. I DO NOT BELIEVE THE PEOPLE OF THE NATION WILL STAND FOR IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR THIS IS ABOUT POWER. PURE AND SIMPLE. POWER. THE VOTERS SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR ON THIS ISSUE, AS WITH SO MANY OTHERS, THE POWER IN THIS NATION RESIDES WITH THEM, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE VOTERS. EVEN IF PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO PUT FORWARD A NAME NOW, THE SENATE SHOULD NOT ACT UNTIL AFTER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SELECT THEIR NEXT PRESIDENT. THEIR NEXT SENATE. THE SENATE SHOULD MOVE ON DONALD TRUMP'S SELECTION AND WAY THE NOMINEE HE CHOOSES FAIRLY. IF I WIN THIS ELECTION, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINEE SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN. AS A NEW PRESIDENT, I SHOULD BE THE ONE WHO NOMINATES JUSTICE GINSBURG'S SUCCESSOR. THE NOMINATION GET A FAIR HEARING IN THE SENATE BEFORE A CONFIRMATION HEARING , VOTE, AFTER A CONFIRMATION HEARING. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. WE ARE PROBABLY PASSING 200,000 DEATHS TO THIS VIRUS. TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE UNEMPLOYED. HEALTH CARE IN THE COUNTRY HANGS IN THE BALANCE OF THE COURT. AND NOW THEY HAVE DECIDED TO JAM A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE SUPREME COURT THROUGH THE SENATE. VOTERS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN CASTING THEIR VOTES. IN THE MILLIONS. IN JUST A FEW WEEKS, WE WILL KNOW WHO THE VOTERS OF THE NATION HAVE CHOSEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT. THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION WAS DESIGNED TO GIVE VOTERS ONE CHANCE TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD ON WHO SERVES ON THE COURT. THERE IS NO COURT SESSION BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE ELECTION. THAT MOMENT IS NOW FOR THE VOTERS TO GET A CHANCE TO BE HEARD AND THEIR VOICES SHOULD BE HEARD. THEY WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS ABUSE OF POWER. THIS CONSTITUTIONAL ABUSE. THERE IS NO CAN , NO DISCUSSION ON THE EVE OF AN ELECTION OR THE LAME DUCK DONALD TRUMP LOSES. JUSTICE GINSBURG, WHAT HAPPENS? BUT THAT DISCUSSION ASSUMES WE MOVE THIS EFFORT TO PREVENT THE GRAVE WRONG JUST , THAT MCCONNELL IS PURSUING HERE. I BELIEVE THE VOICES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD AND WILL BE HEARD. THIS FIGHT, THIS NOMINATION, WILL NOT BE OVER UNTIL THE SENATE VOTE. WINNING THAT VOTE, IF IT HAPPENS, IS EVERYTHING. ACTION AND REACTION, ANGER AND MORE ANGER. THAT IS THE CYCLE OF , THAT REPUBLICAN SENATORS WILL CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE AS THEY GO DOWN THIS DANGEROUS PATH THAT THEY PUT US ON. WE NEED TO DEESCALATE, NOT ESCALATE. IT IS WHY I APPEALED TO THE FEW SENATE REPUBLICANS, WHO REALLY WILL DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS. PLEASE FOLLOW YOUR CONSCIENCE. DO NOT VOTE TO CONFIRM ANYONE NOMINATED , DO NOT GO THERE. UPHOLD YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY, YOUR CONSCIENCE. LET PEOPLE SPEAK. WE CANNOT KEEP REWRITING HISTORY AND SCRAPPING NORMS, IGNORING OUR CHERISHED SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. THAT INCLUDES THIS WHOLE BUSINESS OF RELEASING THE LIST OF NOMINEES THAT I WOULD PUT FORWARD, AND THEY SAID BIDEN SHOULD RELEASES LIST AFTER RUTH BADER GINSBURG PASSED AWAY. IT IS A GAME FOR THEM. IT IS A PLAY TO GIN UP EMOTIONS AND ANGER. THERE IS RECENT , A REASON WHY NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OTHER THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS EVER DONE , FIRST, PUTTING A JUDGE'S NAME ON A LIST LIKE THAT COULD INFLUENCE THAT PERSON'S DECISION-MAKING AS A JUDGE AND THAT WOULD BE WRONG. ANYONE PUT ON A LIST LIKE THAT OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WOULD BE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL ATTACKS. ANY NOMINEE I WOULD SELECT WOULD NOT GET A HEARING UNTIL 2021 AT THE EARLIEST. SHE WOULD ENDURE THOSE ATTACKS FOR MONTHS ON END WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DEFEND HERSELF. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, IF I WIN, I WILL MAKE MY CHOICE FOR THE SUPREME COURT NOT JUST ON PARTISAN ELECTION CAMPAIGN, BUT ON WHAT PRIOR PRESIDENTS HAVE DONE, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, AND I HAVE SERVED MANY OF THEM. ONLY SEEKING THEIR ADVICE AND ASKING , IT SAYS ADVISE AND CONSENT. THE PRESIDENT IS THE PERSON WHO GETS TO NAME SOMEONE. AS EVERYONE KNOWS, I MADE IT CLEAR THAT MY FIRST CHOICE FOR THE SUPREME COURT WILL MAKE HISTORY AS THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN JUSTICE. BUT I WILL CONSULT WITH SENATORS OF BOTH PARTIES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND CIVIL LEADERS OF OUR COUNTRY. THE CHOICE WILL BE MINE AND MINE ALONE, BUT IT WILL BE THE PRODUCT OF A PROCESS THAT RESTORES OUR FINEST TRADITIONS, NOT THE EXTENSION OF ONE THAT HAS TORN THE COUNTRY APART FOR YEARS. LET ME CONCLUDE WITH THIS. AS I SAID IN THIS CAMPAIGN, WE ARE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE COUNTRY. WE FACE HISTORIC CRISES. A ONCE IN A GENERATION PANDEMIC, A DEVASTATING ECONOMIC RECESSION . THE RISE OF WHITE SUPREMACY UNSEEN SINCE THE 1960'S, AND A RECKONING ON RACE THAT IS LONG OVERDUE. IT CHALLENGING CLIMATE, A CHANGING CLIMATE RAVAGING OUR NATION AND THE WORLD AS WE SPEAK. SUPREME COURT DECISIONS WILL TOUCH EVERY PART OF THESE CRISES , EVERY PART OF OUR LIVES AND FUTURE. THE LAST THING WE NEED IS TO ADD A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS THAT PLUNGES US DEEPER INTO THE ABYSS , DEEPER INTO THE DARKNESS. IF WE GO DOWN THIS PATH, I PREDICT IT WILL CAUSE IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE. THE INFECTION THIS PRESIDENT HAS UNLEASHED ON OUR DEMOCRACY, ENOUGH. ENOUGH. ENOUGH. WE MUST COME TOGETHER AS A NATION. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, LIBERALS, CONSERVATIVES, EVERYBODY. WE DO NOT HAVE TO AGREE ON EVERYTHING. BUT WE HAVE TO REASON OUR WAY THROUGH WHAT AILS US, AS CITIZENS, AS VOTERS, AS PUBLIC SERVANTS, THAT IS THE CONSTITUTION. WE HAVE TO ACT IN GOOD FAITH AND MUTUAL GOOD WROTE , MUTUAL GOODWILL IN THE SPIRIT OF NOT CONFRONTATION. THIS NATION WILL CONTINUE TO BE INSPIRED BY RUTH BADER GINSBURG BUT WE SHOULD NOT ONLY BE INSPIRED BY HER BUT GUIDED BY HER. BY HER WILLINGNESS TO LISTEN TO THOSE WITH WHOM SHE DISAGREES. TO RESPECT OTHER POINTS OF VIEW. JUSTICE GINSBURG GOT ALONG WELL WITH SOME OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES ON THE COURT. SHE DID IT WITHOUT COMPROMISING HER PRINCIPLES, OR LOSING HER CORE PRINCIPLES. IF SHE COULD DO THIS, SO CAN WE. HOW WE TALK TO ONE ANOTHER MATTERS. HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER MATTERS. RESPECTING OTHERS MATTERS. JUSTICE GINSBURG PROVED IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SPINE OF STEEL. BUT ALSO IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN OPEN HAND AND NOT A CLENCHED FISH , FIST TO THOSE WITH WHOM WE DISAGREE. THIS NATION NEEDS TO COME TOGETHER. I HAVE SAID IT MANY TIMES IN THIS ELECTION. WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT OVERCOME AND NOTHING WE CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO WANT TO THE , TO DIVIDE THE NATION BETWEEN RED AND BLUE STATES, REPRESENTING THOSE STATES THAT VOTE FOR HIM AND IGNORING THOSE WHO DON'T. I DO NOT. I CANNOT. I WILL NOT FILL THAT , I WILL NOT BE THAT PRESIDENT. I WILL BE THE PRESIDENT FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY. FOR THOSE WHO VOTE FOR ME AND THOSE WHO VOTE AGAINST ME. WE NEED TO RISE TO THE MOMENT, FOR THE SAKE OF THE COUNTRY WE LOVE SO DEARLY. FOR HIS VERY SOUL. MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS, AND MAY GOD BLESS RUTH BADER GINSBURG. THANK YOU SO MUCH.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?476046-1\/joe-biden-remarks-replacing-justice-ginsburg","Summary":"2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered remarks on the next steps in replacing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose death was announced two days prior.

THIS STOP MARKED HIS SECOND VISIT TO WISCONSIN. A CLOSE RACE IN THE STATE BETWEEN HIM AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. (music) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS THEY SAY, AND PART OF MY CITY, YOUR FAMILY DONE GOOD. A LONG TIME. GOD LOVE YOU. GIVE YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. TODAY, UNFORTUNATELY, AMERICA IS GOING TO HAVE TO SPEAK TO THIS QUICKLY, TRYING TO REACH A TRAGIC MILESTONE. 200,000 DEATHS RECORDED, AS OF TODAY BECAUSE OF CORONAVIRUS. 200,000 DEATHS ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. EMPTY CHAIRS AND UNDOING TABLES, KITCHEN TABLES THAT WEEKS AND MONTHS AGO WERE FILLED WITH A LOVED ONE, A MOM, DAD, BROTHER OR SISTER. IN MANY CASES, THE PAIN WAS MADE A LOT WORSE. I HAD PEOPLE TELL ME THIS WITH CLOSE FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY TELLING ME BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO VISIT THEIR ELDERLY PARENT OR GRANDPARENT IN THE NURSING HOME BEFORE THEY PASSED AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY STORIES I HEARD FROM THE NURSES, SAYING THEY HELD UP THE CELL PHONE TO THE PATIENT ON THE VENTILATOR, IN THE BED. THAT IS ALL THEY CAN SPEAK TO. THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WERE NOT ABLE TO HOLD FUNERAL SERVICES WHERE THEY COULD PRAY TOGETHER AND REMEMBER THE LOVED ONES THAT THEY LOST. SO MANY OF THE RITUALS HAVE COME TO HELP US COPE WITH PAIN AND LOSS, TO HELP US HONOR THE LIVES OF THOSE WE LOVED. THEY ARE JUST NOT AVAILABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC. WHAT WORRIES ME NOW IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH THIS PANDEMIC FOR SO LONG, THAT I WORRY THAT WE RISK BECOME NUMB TO THE TOLL THAT IS TAKEN ON US AND OUR COUNTRY, AND COMMUNITIES LIKE THIS. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. WE CANNOT LOSE THE ABILITY TO FEEL THE SORROW, LOSS AND ANGER FOR SO MANY LIVES LOST. WE CANNOT LET THE NUMBERS BECOME STATISTICS AND BACKGROUND NOISE, JUST A BLUR IN THE NIGHTLY NEWS. THEY ARE NO LONGER WITH US. SO MANY OF THEM DID NOT HAVE TO LOSE THEIR LIVES TO THIS VIRUS. IF ONLY THE PRESIDENT HAD ACTED SOONER. BACK IN MAY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY RELEASED A STUDY SAYING IF WE HAD ACTED ON MONTH SOONER, WE WOULD HAVE SAVED 70 LIVES. THE LEADING MODEL BEING USED TO TRACK THE VIRUS, THAT MODEL SAYS BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THIS YEAR, WHILE WE ARE WAITING FOR A VACCINE, BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR, WE WILL LOSE UP TO 200,000 ADDITIONAL LIVES. IT POINTS OUT THAT IF WE ACT BY DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE IN WISCONSIN, WEARING A MASK AND MAKING MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD SAVE OVER 115,000 OF THOSE LIVES. I HOPE TO GOD WE WILL NOT HAVE TO LEARN THE SAME BAD LESSON WE LEARNED THE FIRST NINE MONTHS. WE HAVE SEEN ONE OF THE GREATEST LOSSES OF AMERICAN LIFE IN HISTORY. SADLY, IT IS NOT OVER. AS AWFUL AS THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN, IT COULD BE WORSE. WE COULD BE LOOKING AT 178,000 LIVES LOST. ALL THE PRESIDENT DOES IS DELIBERATELY CHANGE THE SUBJECT. IT IS INFURIATING. WE COULD SAVE LIVES, IF WE JUST TAKE SIMPLE STEPS. STILL, THE PRESIDENT REFUSES. WE WATCHED TIM HOLDEN INDOOR RALLY WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT KNEW OF THESE DANGERS BACK IN FEBRUARY. HE HID IT FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE UNDERSTOOD HOW BAD IT WAS. THIS IS A DEADLY VIRUS, FAR MORE DEADLY THAN ANY FLU, BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT HE WAS SAYING TO US PUBLICLY. PUBLICLY, HE TOLD US IT WAS JUST LIKE THE FLU AND THAT IT WOULD DISAPPEAR IN THE WARM WEATHER. IT WAS ALL A LIE. HE KNEW IT. WHAT WAS HIS EXPLANATION? HE SAID HE DID NOT WANT TO SEE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PANIC. TRUMP PANICKED. THE VIRUS WAS TOO BIG FOR HIM. WITH THIS CRISIS, A REAL CRISIS THAT REQUIRED SERIOUS PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP, HE WAS NOT UP TO IT. HE FROZE. HE FAILED TO ACT. AMERICA HAS PAID THE WORST PRICE OF ANY NATION IN THE WORLD. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING. WE DO NOT PANIC. UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS SAYING BECAUSE IT CRYSTALLIZES HIS WHOLE WORLDVIEW. WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAID HE DID NOT WANT TO CREATE A PANIC, HE WAS NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT A HEALTH PANIC. HE WAS WORRIED THAT IF HE TOLD THE PUBLIC THE TRUTH, THERE WOULD BE A PANIC OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, WHICH WOULD HURT HIS CHANCES OF BEING REELECTED. HE SEES THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. I SEE IT FROM WHERE I GREW UP IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. HARD WORK. YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE, ALL YOU CAN SEE IS WALL STREET. YOU THINK WALL STREET BUILT THIS COUNTRY? YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP THANKS THAT HANDING OUT A TAX GIVEAWAY, PRIMARILY FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS AND WEALTHY QUALIFIERS IS AN ECONOMIC PLAN? YOU THINK LIKE TRUMP THAT $15 IS TOO MUCH FOR AMERICA'S ESSENTIAL WORKERS? ELIMINATED OVERTIME PAY FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICAN WORKERS. TRIED TO TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE FROM 20 MILLION AMERICANS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC. TRY TO TAKE AWAY PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR 130 BILLION AMERICANS. PROPOSED A PLAN, IN ORDER TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD, YOU WILL GET A LITTLE BUMP IN YOUR PAY, BUT WE WILL NOT TAKE OUT WITHHOLDING FOR YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, BUT GUESS WHAT? SOCIAL SECURITY SAYS IF HE DOES THAT, SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE BANKRUPT BY THE MIDDLE OF 2023. YOU MIGHT GET THAT OUT OF YOUR PAYCHECK, A LITTLE MORE IN YOUR PAYCHECK, BUT GUESS WHAT? TELL YOUR MOM AND DAD, SAY GOODBYE TO SOCIAL SECURITY. THEY WILL HAVE TO WORK FOR THEIR WHOLE LIVES. THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT WE GOT OUT OF IT, A LOT OF DAIRY FARMERS AND MANUFACTURING WENT UNDER, BUT GUESS WHAT? STARTING A TRADE WAR THAT A SURGE IN BANKRUPTCY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? I DID NOT KNOW THIS AT FIRST. AMERICA'S BANK GOT TO OPEN UP IN BEIJING. THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO BEFORE. LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. HE HAD A DEAL, BUT HE WANTED THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, BEFORE THEY LOWERED THE PRICES, TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS UNETHICAL. HE ASKED THEM TO SEND OUT $100 CHECKS WITH HIS NAME ON IT TO THE ELDERLY. SAYING THAT IS THE DOWN PAYMENT. THEY SAID, GOOGLE NOT DO THAT. THE DEAL FELL APART. NOW, SOME 30 MILLION PEOPLE ARE ON UNEMPLOYMENT. HERE IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THE TAX RATE ALL OF YOU PAY IS GOING TO BE HIGHER THAN BILLIONAIRES WHO MAKE THEIR MONEY ON INVESTMENTS. HE WANTS TO LOWER AGAIN, LOWER THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX. SOMEONE WHO MAKES THEIR MONEY OFF THE MARKET IS PAYING THE 50% RATE. IT DEPENDS ON THE TAX BRACKET. CLEWISTON PERCENT. THIS TAX CUT WILL COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. WHO IS HYDE DOES IT COME OUT OF? DONALD TRUMP RAN FOR OFFICE SAYING HE WOULD REPRESENT THE FORGOTTEN MAN AND WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY. NOT ONLY DID HE FORGET THEM, THE TRUTH IS THAT HE NEVER REALLY RESPECTED US VERY MUCH. HE LOVES HIS RALLIES. THE NEXT TIME HE HOLDS ONE, LOOK CLOSELY. HE KEEPS HIS DISTANCE FROM ANYONE IN THE RALLY. THOSE WHO COME ARE TIGHT AS CAN BE, RISKING DISEASE, BUT NOT TRUMP. HE KEEPS HIS DISTANCE. A REPORTER TRIED TO COME UP AND HE SAID NO, YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. I DO NOT GET CLOSE TO THESE PEOPLE. EVERYBODY IN THE CROWD RISKS THEIR LIVES, BUT NOT HIM. NOW WE KNOW WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT PEOPLE IN HIS RALLIES. A FORMER EMPLOYEE SAID HE CALLS HIS EMPLOYEES DISGUSTING. SHE DOES NOT HAVE TO SHAKE THEIR HANDS. THAT IS THE GOOD THING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC. THESE ARE ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT AND NOT RESPECT. DO NOT KID YOURSELF. THIS IS A ONE-WAY STREET. NOTHING IS MORE OFFENSIVE THAN THE WAY HE SPOKE ABOUT MANY OF YOU BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED YOUR NATION IN UNIFORM. IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY EVERY OUTLET THAT HE REFERRED TO THEM AS LOSERS AND SUCKERS. THAT IS WHAT TRUMP CALLED THE PEOPLE WHO SERVED AND MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. MY SON SERVED AS A VOLUNTEER TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. HE COME , CAME HOME DECORATED AND DIED OF CANCER. HE WAS NOT A LOSER. HE WAS NOT A SUCKER. HE WAS A PATRIOT. ALL THOSE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE SERVED VOLUNTEERED. JUST LIKE YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS. I HAVE DEALT WITH PEOPLE LIKE TRUMP MY WHOLE LIFE. HE LOOKED DOWN ON US BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. GUYS WHO THINK THEY ARE BETTER THAN YOU, GUYS WHO INHERIT EVERYTHING THEY HAVE EVER GOTTEN IN THEIR LIFE AND SQUANDERED IT. GUYS WHO STIFF ELECTRICIANS AND CONTRACTORS JUST TO PUT A FEW MORE BUCKS IN THEIR POCKET. THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO AVOID PAYING THEIR TAXES BECAUSE THEY FIGURE THE REST OF US, THE LITTLE PEOPLE CAN PICK UP THE TAB FOR THE COUNTRY. DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT THE REASON WE HAVE NOT SEEN TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS IS BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT US TO KNOW WHAT HE PAID? HE HAD TO SUMMON THEM OVER. THEY SHOW THAT HE PAID ZERO. HE PAID ZERO, NOTHING. THAT IS A FACT. AND HE WAS ASKED ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? THIS IS WHY I REALLY DO NOT LIKE GUYS LIKE THIS. HE SAID, IT MAKES ME SMART. PUT ANOTHER WAY, I AM NOT A SUCKER. WHY SHOULD I PAY? ZERO. WALL STREET IS A LONG WAY FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. YOU GET TO SEE THE WORLD A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY THERE. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY. HARD-WORKING PEOPLE BUILT THIS COUNTRY. UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. UNION LABOR, LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. I LEARNED A FEW SIMPLE LESSONS FROM MY PARENTS THAT I NEVER FORGOT. ONE IS FROM MY MOTHER. GENERALLY, REMEMBER, NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU, BUT EVERYONE IS YOUR THE , EQUAL. IT IS PRETTY SIMPLE. WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND WE SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. I GOT MY BACK UP RECENTLY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I SAW ON NATIONAL TELEVISION ABOUT THE RACE. I DO NOT BUY IT. JOE BIDEN WILL BE ONLY THE FIRST PRESIDENT WHO DID NOT GO TO AN IV LEAGUE SCHOOL , IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL IN A LONG TIME. SOMEHOW, IT MEANT THAT I COULD NOT BELONG. HOW COULD A GUY WHO WENT TO A STATE SCHOOL BE PRESIDENT? I HAVE TO ADMIT, I SAID IT. I AM NOT PROUD OF IT. HE CLOSED THE DOOR ON ME. YOU THINK I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH? I AM GOING TO BUST DOWN THAT DOOR. A LOT OF YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY BECAUSE OF OUR STANDING. I SAY, IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT A STATE SCHOOL PRESIDENT SAT IN THE OVAL OFFICE. IF I AM SITTING THERE, YOU WILL BE SITTING THERE TOO. ANOTHER LESSON, I LEARNED FROM MY DAD. MY DAD LOST A JOB UP WE HAD TO MOVE WE HAD TO GO TO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW AND A, CAN JEAN AND THE KIDS STAY WITH YOU FOR ABOUT A YEAR? I WILL MAKE IT UP TO YOU. I HAVE A JOB IN DELAWARE. I WILL COME HOME EVERY WEEKEND. TALK ABOUT PRIDE. HE USED TO SAY, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY, RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY, BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, IT IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. THE DIGNITY OF WORK. WHAT YOU DO MATTERS. YOU MATTER. I DO NOT WANT TO PUNISH ANYBODY. IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT WE START TO REWARD WORK. NOBODY MAKING LESS THAN FORTON THOUSAND DOLLARS , $400,000 IN THIS COUNTRY WILL SEE THEIR TAXES GO UP. IF YOU MAKE MORE, YOU WILL START TO PAY MORE. I AM NOT LOOKING TO PUNISH ANYONE. SOME OF THE WEALTHIEST CORPORATIONS NEED TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. MANY OF THEM ARE PAYING ZERO. THEY TAKE NO TAX AT ALL. HOW CAN THAT BE FAIR? THE PRESIDENT TALKS ALL THE TIME ABOUT HOW GREAT THE ECONOMY IS. THE BILLIONAIRES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE SEEING THEIR WEALTH INCREASE BY $800 BILLION. ALL THE BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA, DURING THE PANDEMIC, THEIR NET WORTH, COMBINED HAVE INCREASED BY $800 BILLION. THE REST OF US? 30 MILLION PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED. 20 MILLION AMERICANS ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOME. SEVEN PLUS MILLION AMERICANS ARE WORKING PART-TIME, WHO WANT TO WORK FULL-TIME. EVICTIONS ARE ON THE RISE. FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES, THE KIDS ARE AT HOME AND NOT AT SCHOOL. IT IS THE WORKING PEOPLE WHO KNEW HE'D , WHO NEED A TAX BREAK. YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT. I SAID IT MANY TIMES. NEED TO I'VE SAID IT MANY TIMES DURING THIS PANDEMIC, WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN JUST PRAISE OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS, WE NEED TO PAY THEM. WE NEED TO MAKE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERY AMERICAN. MY PLAN WILL LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BY 60%. IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS OBAMA AND I PUT IN PLACE AND MAKE IT A LOT MORE AFFORDABLE TO HAVE THAT HEALTH CARE. WE NEED TO EMPOWER LABOR UNIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT DIDN'T SAY IN THE 1930'S, YOU CAN'T HAVE LABOR UNIONS. IT SAID WE SHOULD PROMOTE LABOR UNIONS. THAT'S WHAT IT SAID, AND I WILL. ONE MORE THING. UNDER MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN, WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE WITH UNION WORKERS AND PREVAILING WAGE, WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. WE'RE GOING TO REBUILD MANUFACTURING IN THIS COUNTRY. WE'LL DO IT BY ENFORCING A REAL BUY AMERICAN PLAN. LOOK, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT $600 BILLION A YEAR IN PURCHASING POWER THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS EVERY YEAR FROM TAX DOLLARS AND DETERMINES HOW IT'S USED. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GOD WILLING, AMERICAN COMPANIES WITH AMERICAN WORKERS BUILDING AMERICAN PRODUCTS USING AMERICAN SUPPLY CHAINS ARE GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONES WHO GET THE CONTRACTS. THAT MEANS AMERICAN ALUMINUM FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, FOR DEVELOPING MORE WIND AND SOLAR AND HYDROELECTRIC POWER. ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL REPLACE CARS IN THE FEDERAL FLEET. WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST FLEETS IN THE WORLD, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT THEM ALL TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. GUESS WHAT? THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING MUCH MORE LIGHTER FRAMES, MORE ALUMINUM FOR AUTOMOBILES THAT ALREADY IF THEY ARE ALUMINUM BUILT, THEY CAN REDUCE BY 15%, EVEN WITH A COMBUSTION ENGINE. 1.5 MILLION NEW AFFORDABLE HOMES AND HOUSING. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD. THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF WORK, INCREASED WORK AT HOME. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TRANSFER 40 MILLION BUILDINGS AROUND AMERICA TO MAKE THEM WEATHER RESISTANT SO THEY ARE CHANGE THE WINDOWS, DOORS, WALLS, THE WHOLE RANGE. BUILDING BACK BETTER MEANS FIRING UP OUR SHUTTERED FOUNDRIES AND MOVING FORWARD TO BUSINESS THAT IS TRULY MADE IN AMERICA. I WANT TO SPEND A FEW MOMENTS TALKING TO THOSE WHO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP LAST TIME. WHEN I WAS OUT HERE IN OUR ADMINISTRATION, YOU VOTED FOR US. THEN AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTY CHANGED, AND THEY VOTED FOR TRUMP LAST TIME. I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE FRUSTRATED, ANGRY, BELIEVED YOU WEREN'T BEING SEEN, REPRESENTED OR HEARD. I GET IT. IT HAS TO CHANGE. I PROMISE YOU THIS, IT WILL CHANGE WITH ME. YOU WILL BE SEEN, HEARD, AND RESPECTED BY ME. THIS CAMPAIGN ISN'T JUST ABOUT WINNING VOTES, IT'S ABOUT RESTORING THE BASIC DIGNITY IN THIS COUNTRY THAT EVERY WORKER DESERVES. BASIC DIGNITY WE ALL HAVE WITHOUT WINNING BACK HEARTS AND SOUL OF AMERICA, WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN I WAS ASKED ABOUT THE DEATH COUNT APPROACHING 200,000, THE PRESIDENT SAID, AND I QUOTE, HE SAID , I WON'T QUOTE HIM. THE PRESIDENT SAID, IF YOU TAKE OUT THE BLUE STATES RUN BY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS AND JUST LOOK AT THE RED STATES, REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ARE DOING QUITE WELL. NOW, OF COURSE, IT'S A SIMPLE FACTUAL MATTER, IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. IF YOU COUNT ALL THE DEATHS IN THE RED STATES, WE ARE NUMBER TWO IN THE WORLD IN DEATHS JUST BEHIND BRAZIL. BUT MORE FUNDAMENTALLY, IT REFLECTS ON THE PART OF DONALD TRUMP THAT HE HAS A DEEPLY FLAWED AND DIVISIVE VIEW OF THE UNITED STATES. THIS NATION AND THE JOB HE HOLDS. THINK ABOUT WHAT HE'S SAYING. IF YOU LIVE IN A STATE LIKE WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, STATES WITH DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS, YOU'RE NOT HIS PROBLEM. HE HAS NO OBLIGATION TO YOU. HE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU AS PRESIDENT, YOUR FAMILY OR WELL-BEING. I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY. I DON'T PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO RED STATES OR BLUE STATES OF AMERICA, I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ONE NATION UNDER GOD FOR REAL. I'M RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT. I'M NOT GOING TO GOVERN AS A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, I'M GOING TO GOVERNOR AS PRESIDENT. I GET CRITICIZED FOR SAYING THAT SOMETIMES TO SOME IN MY PARTY, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I'M GOING TO FIGHT AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORTED ME AS THOSE WHO DID NOT SUPPORT ME. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT, FOR GOD'S SAKE, THIS HAS TO BE AN AMERICAN MOMENT. IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO PUT ANGER AND DIVISION AND THE DARKNESS THAT'S OVERTAKEN THIS COUNTRY BEHIND US. WE HAVE TO PUT IT BEHIND US. I KNOW I'VE BEEN CRITICIZED SINCE I ENTERED PRIMARIES ABOUT UNITING THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. WE CAN. WE'VE DONE IT SO MANY TIMES IN OUR HISTORY. WE'VE BEGUN ANEW. IF WE GET CONTROL OF THIS VIRUS, WE CAN. WE CAN REWARD WORK. WE CAN FIX THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE CAN BE A SAFE AND JUST NATION. WE CAN DEAL WITH THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WHICH ALUMINUM IS GOING TO BE A GIGANTIC PART OF. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST, ONE NATION. ONE NATION. ONE PEOPLE. ONE AMERICA. WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO IN GOD'S NAME WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN OUR LONG HISTORY, THERE'S BEEN NOTHING WE'VE BEEN UNABLE TO DO , NOTHING WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OVERCOME WHEN WE'VE DONE IT TOGETHER. I'M CONFIDENT GOING ALL OVER THIS NATION, WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY. WE HAVE TO BRING THE NATION TOGETHER. THAT'S GOING TO BE MY PRIMARY JOB. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. GOD BLESS YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. Y'ALL STAY SAFE AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. MAYOR. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU, MA'AM. APPRECIATE IT.

IT'S STILL GOOD MORNING, I BELIEVE. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT ON THIS FABULOUS CHARLOTTE FALL DAY TO HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WITH A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON THAT WE WILL HOPE TO SEE IN JANUARY, ON A STAGE, BEING INAUGURATED AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. [APPLAUSE] BUT BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS CONVERSATION, WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE RECOGNIZES WHERE WE ARE. WE ARE IN CAMP NORTH END, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE'RE IN A PLACE WHERE CREATIVITY FLOURISHES. THE ARTISTS THAT HAVE WORKED ON THE ART THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE TODAY, WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THEM. THEY'RE PEOPLE THAT GIVE SO MUCH, AND THEY DON'T GET PAID ENOUGH. AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE. IN A PANDEMIC, WE OUGHT TO BE REWARDING PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THE WORK THAT MAKES US BETTER PEOPLE, AND THAT'S WHAT ARTISTS DO. SO I WANT TO RECOGNIZE DAMMIT WESLEY. IS DAMMIT AROUND? OKAY. GIANNA MCCANTZ. WHERE'S GIANNA? GIANNA? CARLA LOW AS, GARRISON, MARCUS, FRANK, AND JOHN HARRISON. THEY HAVE DONE A MURAL THAT SAYS \"CAMP NORTH IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH , CAROLINA , BUILD BACK BETTER.\" AND WE ALL KNOW WHOSE PLAN THAT IS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING. I AM GOING TO SAY THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE SOMEONE THAT YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH, SOMEONE THAT YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW THAT IS A BIG PROFESSIONAL BOWLING FAN, THAT LIKES MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL, BUT I'LL LET YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU REALLY KNOW HIM FOR. SO THANK YOU, LET'S WELCOME OUR NEXT GUEST. (music) [APPLAUSE] MAYOR LYLES, THANK YOU SO MUCH. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, WELCOME TO CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA. IT FEELS SO GOOD TO BE HOME. YOU GUYS KNOW I WAS IN A BUBBLE FOR A WHILE RECENTLY. MAN, THIS IS IMPORTANT. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, AND THAT'S WHY I'M GLAD TO BE A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. BEING BORN AND RAISED IN NORTH CAROLINA, THIS IS HOME FOR ME. ALWAYS WILL BE HOME FOR ME. AND SO TO BE A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION AND TO JUST HAVE REAL CONVERSATIONS, WE HAD A CONVERSATION IN THE BACK AND I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT HOW GRATEFUL AND PRIVILEGED I AM TO BE A PART OF THESE TOUGH, DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS, ESPECIALLY DURING THIS TIME. BEING A PARENT, HAVE AN 11 YEAR OLD SON, A EIGHT YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, THESE TIMES ARE VERY CRUCIAL AND VERY IMPORTANT. I CAN'T EXPLAIN ENOUGH HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED. AND YOU GUYS BEING HERE, EVERYTHING IS ABOUT RESPECT. EVERYTHING IS ABOUT RESPECT. SO TEACHING MY KIDS ABOUT RESPECTING THE OFFICE, HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS, AND THAT'S WHY THIS ELECTION IS IMPORTANT. A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE SAY, \"MY VOTE DOESN'T COUNT.\" I COME FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHERE YOU LIVE AND STUFF SAY, \"IT DOESN'T MATTER. AS BLACK PEOPLE, IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU KNOW, IF I VOTE, WHAT'S GOING TO REALLY CHANGE? WE STILL GOT THE SAME RESTAURANTS ON THE CORNERS. WE DON'T HAVE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING PLACES TO EAT. OUR HOMES, THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE, RIGHT?\" SO THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN REALLY ENFORCE OUR POWER IS BY VOTING. VOTING. SO THIS CONVERSATION IS UNBELIEVABLY IMPORTANT. SO GLAD YOU GUYS ARE HERE SO THAT WE CAN ASK SOME REAL QUESTIONS. SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] (music) HELLO, HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN. I'M TRYING TO GET A JOB WITH CHRIS. HE IS MR. PRESIDENT. HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE UNION. MR. PRESIDENT, I WAS KIDDING HIM. YOU KNOW, THE HARDEST THING, ONLY THING HARDER THAN BEING PRESIDENT OF A UNION IS BEING THE MAYOR OF A BEAUTIFUL CITY. FOLKS, THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE TODAY. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WE EVEN HAVE AN ASTRONAUT IN OUR HOUSE AND I TELL YOU WHAT, THAT'S PRETTY COOL. LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK CHRIS AND THE MAYOR FOR BEING HERE, AND ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOU KNOW, THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES. OVER 200,000 AMERICANS HAVE PASSED AWAY. OVER 200,000, AND THE NUMBER IS STILL RISING. THE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES IS BAD ACROSS THE BOARD, BUT PARTICULARLY BAD FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. ALMOST FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY, THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO CATCH THE DISEASE, COVID, AND WHEN IT'S CAUGHT, TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE AS WHITE AMERICANS. IT'S SORT OF EMBLEMATIC OF THE INEQUALITY THAT EXISTS AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXIST. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTERS TO ME, IS IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. YOU HAVE 30 MILLION PEOPLE ON UNEMPLOYMENT, YOU HAVE 20 MILLION PEOPLE FIGURING WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN PAY THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENT THIS MONTH, AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO OR NOT DO AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT, AND YOU'VE GOT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THROWN OUT IN THE STREET BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY THEIR RENT. ALTHOUGH THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN A REPRIEVE FOR THREE MONTHS, BUT THEY HAVE TO PAY DOUBLE THE NEXT THREE MONTHS WHEN IT COMES AROUND. HOW ARE PEOPLE GOING TO DO THAT? AND THE WAY, IN FACT, THE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE AND THE SENATE STEPPED UP AND PASSED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO HELP PEOPLE GET THROUGH THE PROCESS, INCLUDING KEEPING BUSINESSES OPEN AND THE LIKE. WELL, GUESS WHAT? THEY INSISTED THERE BEING A THING CALLED AN INSPECTOR GENERAL, SOMEBODY WATCHING WHERE EVERY DOLLAR WENT. THE FIRST THING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DID IS FIRE THAT INSPECTOR GENERAL. THERE IS NO INSPECTOR. HE'S FIRED. FIRED. AND SO YOU'VE GOT ONLY 40% OF THE MONEY INTENDED FOR SMALL BUSINESSES GOING TO SMALL BUSINESSES. ONLY 40% OF IT. 60% HAS GONE TO THE MAR-A-LAGO CROWD. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE FIND OURSELVES IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR PEOPLE IS VERY MUCH IN DOUBT, ALTHOUGH THE HOUSE JUST PASSED A PACKAGE TODAY. MY GENERIC POINT IS, THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLUMBIA POINTED OUT, THAT IF IN FACT THE PRESIDENT HAD ACTED, EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW NOW HE KNEW EXACTLY HOW BAD THE PANDEMIC WAS BACK IN FEBRUARY , HE IS ON TAPE WITH BOB WOODWARD SAYING HE KNEW HOW BAD IT WAS AND HE DIDN'T SAY A THING. HE DIDN'T SAY A THING. IF HE HAD SPOKEN, AS I SAID, THEY SAID AT COLUMBIA, ONE WEEK EARLIER, 37,000 MORE PEOPLE BE ALIVE TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER INFLUX OF CASES, JUST BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY, IT'S EXPECTED THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DEPENDING ON WHICH ESTIMATE YOU , TAKE, BETWEEN 138000 AND 178,000 MORE DEATHS. AND IF PEOPLE JUST DO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE, AND WHEN YOU'RE AT A SOCIAL DISTANCE, AS I AM, YOU CAN TAKE A MASK OFF, BUT WEAR A MASK. THEY ESTIMATE THAT WOULD SAVE ABOUT CLOSE TO 90,000 PEOPLE. 89,000, AND SO IT'S ABOUT BEING RESPONSIBLE. IT'S ABOUT BEING RESPONSIBLE. AND WE'RE NOT BEING VERY RESPONSIBLE. BUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS THAT WE HAVE TO BREAK A CYCLE. THE CYCLE THAT EXISTS IS THAT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY BY AND LARGE FINDS ITSELF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ECONOMIC HEAP, BUSINESSES AND OTHERS, WHEN THINGS ARE GOOD. WHEN THINGS GET BAD, THEY'RE THE FIRST ONES IN THE HOLE. AND WHEN THINGS GET BETTER, THEY'RE THE LAST ONES OUT. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT NEEDS SIGNIFICANT REPAIR. AND WE'RE JUST ONLY BEGINNING, SLIGHTLY, TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS NOW. AND THIRDLY, IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS PERSON, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, EVERY PERSON OUT THERE WANTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT FOR THEIR FAMILY. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION, \"EVERYBODY'S ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY.\" HE SAID \"JOEY, A JOB IS ABOUT A , LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. BEING ABLE TO HOLD YOUR HEAD UP. BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, 'HONEY, EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY.'\" FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, THEY CAN'T SAY THAT. THAT'S NOT ABLE TO BE DONE. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT TODAY, IS HOW DO WE BUILD WEALTH? ULTIMATELY, ULTIMATELY THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY ONLY IS GOING TO HAVE ITS PLACE EQUAL TO EVERYONE ELSE WHEN THEY'RE IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO BUILD WEALTH, BE ABLE TO BUILD WEALTH. AND THAT GOES FOR EVERYTHING FROM ACCESS TO BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE A HOME, ACCESS TO JOBS, ACCESS TO JUST BEING ABLE TO HAVE AN EVEN SHOT. THAT'S WHAT I HOPE WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT TODAY. IT GOES TO EDUCATION, AS WELL AS ACCESS TO EDUCATION, ACCESS BEYOND. EVERYTHING FROM A LOT OF POOR WHITES AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS, POOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS LIVE IN TITLE I DISTRICTS, MEANING THAT THEY LIVE IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE VERY LOW TAX BASE. RIGHT NOW WE SPEND $15 BILLION A YEAR TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT LOW TAX BASE. I INCREASED THAT TO $45 BILLION. BUT IT DOESN'T KEEP TEACHERS IN SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE'RE SHORT TEACHERS SIGNIFICANTLY. 125,000 TEACHERS SHORT RIGHT NOW. BE OVER HALF A MILLION BY 2023. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE FIND OURSELVES IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE USED TO HAVE IN OUR SCHOOLS, IN THE OLD DAYS, USED TO HAVE 1 , NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY, WE VIRTUALLY HAVE NO SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND SO TEACHERS COME IN TO SCHOOL AND THEY'RE EXPECTED TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. WELL, THERE'S ONE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST FOR EVERY 1,507 KIDS IN SCHOOL. IT SHOULD BE CLOSER TO ONE TO 500. WE CAN DO THAT BY INCREASING THE MONEY I JUST TALKED ABOUT FROM 15 TO 45. AND SEND EVERY SINGLE CHILD THAT'S THREE YEARS OLD, FOUR YEARS OLD, AND FIVE YEARS OLD, NOT TO DAYCARE, BUT TO SCHOOL. ALL THE STUDIES OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITIES IN THIS STATE AND EVERY OTHER HAVE POINTED OUT IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, THAT'LL INCREASE BY 58% THEIR CHANCES OF GOING ALL THE WAY THROUGH SCHOOL, NO MATTER WHAT THE ZIP CODE THEY COME FROM, NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE, AND BE ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT GETTING THEMSELVES IN TROUBLE. THEN WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT, I THINK A BIG ISSUE HERE IS ACCESS TO APPRENTICESHIPS AND ACCESS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND COLLEGE, AND THE STUDENT DEBT REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE THERE. HOPE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BASICALLY ONE BIG, IMPORTANT THING, HOW DO WE CHANGE THE DYNAMIC? THIS IS A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY. AS BAD AS THINGS HAVE GOTTEN, THE BLINDERS HAVE SORT OF BEEN TAKEN OFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOW. THEY LOOK OUT THERE AND WE HAVE A PANDEMIC, UNEMPLOYMENT, RACE RELATIONS HAVE JUST BEEN DRAWN INTO FOCUS EVERYTHING FROM , POLICE BRUTALITY TO LACK OF ACCESS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALL OF A SUDDEN, AVERAGE PEOPLE HAVE GONE, \"MY LORD. HOLY MACKEREL. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THIS BAD.\" A LOT OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW. A LOT DID. BUT A LOT DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THIS BAD. WELL, I WON'T GO INTO IT. I'M TALKING TOO MUCH NOW IN MY OPENING STATEMENT, BUT HERE'S THE POINT. THE POINT IS, I BELIEVE WE HAVE A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY, A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE SYSTEMIC RACISM AND THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS THAT EXIST IN OUR SYSTEM. I THINK WE HAVE TO DO IT, BUT ONLY ONE WAY TO DO IT. WE'VE GOT TO SHOW UP AND VOTE. BUT I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE TURNED OFF. I BELIEVE NO MATTER WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES TO TRY TO MAKE IT HARD TO VOTE FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST PEOPLE OF COLOR, BUT EVERYONE, NO MATTER WHAT, I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN VIRGINIA, EARLY VOTING. THEY HAVE FOUR-HOUR LINES IN THE FIRST DAY, AND WE'RE OVER 40 DAYS OUT. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SHOW UP AND VOTE. THEY WILL NOT BE DISSUADED. SO THAT'S WHY I'M OPTIMISTIC. I WAS ASKED BY ONE OF THE FOREIGN LEADERS WHEN I WAS OVERSEAS, WHEN I WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT, THEY SAID, \"CAN YOU DEFINE AMERICA FOR ME?\" I SAID, \"YES, I CAN, IN ONE WORD. POSSIBILITIES. POSSIBILITIES.\" WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT BELIEVES ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. I THINK WE GOT A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY IN THE YEAR 2020 TO MAKE THESE CHANGES. WITH THAT, AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, I'M GOING TO HUSH UP AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU ALL HAVE. I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY HERE. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, THE FIRST QUESTION WE ARE GOING TO ASK FROM OUR HOMETOWN STAR DUST CHRIS FAR FROM A STAR, BUT : APPRECIATE IT. MY FIRST QUESTION, YOU SORT OF SPOKE ABOUT EDUCATION. AND FOR ME, I'M THE ONLY PERSON IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO AN HBCU. AND YOU, RIGHT DOWN THE STREET , NORTH CAROLINA IS KNOWN FOR HAVING A LOT OF HBCUS. MY QUESTION WOULD BE, THERE'S A LOT THAT'S NOT PROPERLY FUNDING, SORT OF GOING UNDER, SO WHAT COULD YOU DO FOR THE HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES? I WAS KIDDING CHRIS INSIDE. I WAS SAYING AS LONG AS I CAN SAY WHAT THE BEST HBCU IS IN AMERICA, DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY. BUT THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE. THAT'S A JOKE, BUT IT'S NOT A JOKE. THEY'RE GREAT. THAT'S HOW I GOT MY START, BY THE WAY. I WENT TO UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE. BUT THE REASON I GOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS IN THE FIRST PLACE IS BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN MY STATE IN TERMS OF SEGREGATION AND IN TERMS OF DR. KING BEING ASSASSINATED. PART OF THE, MAJOR PART OF OUR CITY WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND. THAT'S HOW I GOT ENGAGED. AND A LOT OF MY SUPPORT CAME OUT OF THAT HBCU. LOOK, RIGHT NOW, ONE THING ALL THE DATA SHOWS IS THAT, GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY, AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING THAT AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN CAN'T DO THAT A WHITE AMERICAN CAN DO, THAT A HISPANIC-AMERICAN, AN ASIAN -AMERICAN , NOT A SINGLE THING. AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENED? IT'S ABOUT ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS. NOW, AN AWFUL LOT OF UNIVERSITIES, GREAT UNIVERSITIES LIKE UNC OR WAKE FOREST, A LOT OF SCHOOLS, THEY HAVE ENDOWMENTS, AND THE ENDOWMENT ALLOWS THEM TO PROVIDE FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO BID FOR THESE MAJOR FEDERAL INITIATIVES THAT ALLOW THEM TO BRING INTO THE SCHOOL A TECHNOLOGY OR A PROGRAM THAT IS ABLE TO BRING IN OUTSIDE SPONSORS, AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT SPONSORS, AND THEN HAVE STUDENTS WORK IN THOSE AREAS. FOR EXAMPLE, CYBERSECURITY. CYBERSECURITY IS A BIG DEAL, BUT YOU HAVE TO , IN THE FUTURE, THERE'S GOING TO BE MILLIONS OVER TIME, GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THE AREA OF CYBERSECURITY. BUT BECAUSE THE HBCUS, FOR EXAMPLE, MOST OF THEM DON'T HAVE THE ECONOMIC , THEY DON'T HAVE THE ENDOWMENT TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THE FACILITIES THAT CAN ATTRACT THE ENVIRONMENT, THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING, AS WELL AS PRIVATE ENDOWMENTS, THEY DON'T GET TO SET THESE UP. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT, WE WENT DOWN TO ROANOKE AND WE PROVIDED FUNDING FOR AN HBCU TO HAVE A CYBERSECURITY PROPOSAL. THEY DID IT. THEY GOT THE CONTRACT. NOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING ARE TRAINING YOUNG WOMEN AND MEN WHO WILL GET OUT IN GOOD STARTING JOBS, JOBS WHERE YOU CAN END UP BEING PAID MORE THAN A HUNDRED GRAND A YEAR. AND THEY'RE FULLY, TOTALLY, THOROUGHLY CAPABLE. SO WHAT I HAVE DONE IS I HAVE PROPOSED , AND WE WILL GET THIS GET THIS DONE, I PROPOSED A 10 YEAR, $70 BILLION PROGRAM FOR HBCUS. THAT $70 BILLION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO HBCUS BASED ON THEIR COMPETITION TO GET ACCESS TO IT, BUT EVERYONE WILL QUALIFY. EVERY HBCU. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO THE KIND OF THINGS OTHER UNIVERSITIES TO. DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY, THE PRESIDENT IS A YOUNG GUY, BRILLIANT GUY. THE RESULT IS WHEN THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE MAKES AN APPLICATION FOR DEALING WITH SOLAR ENERGY, BECAUSE IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT BASE, IT GETS A SIGNIFICANT INJECTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY, OR LIGHT METALS. STORAGE FACILITIES LONG AGO, THEY TOOK OVER A FACILITY LONG AGO. THEY HAVE PEOPLE IN THAT FACILITY WHO ARE NOW DOING METALLURGY THAT RELATE TO MAKING LIGHTWEIGHT ALUMINUM AND METAL DECKS FOR AIRCRAFT CARRIERS. IT IS A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR AND WILL END UP BEING A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR PROJECT. THE PEOPLE WHO GET TO WORK ON THAT, THE STUDENTS, THEY WILL GO OUT AND GET THESE GREAT JOBS. THAT IS THE FIRST THING I WILL DO FOR HBCUS. SECONDLY, WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO BRING IN HBCUS TO ENGAGE IN MORE OF WHAT WE ARE DOING IN TERMS OF THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE. FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OF THE GUYS THAT ARE COSPONSORS OF MY CAMPAIGN, THEY TALK OF THEMSELVES AS MORGAN MEN. THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT UNIVERSITIES INCLUDING RIGHT HERE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FOR YOU THE ABILITY TO GET TO THOSE UNIVERSITIES. HOW CAN YOU DO IT? I WILL SEE TO IT THAT ANY FAMILY, ANYONE WHO COMES FROM A FAMILY THAT MAKES A TOTAL INCOME OF LESS THAN $125,000 A YEAR GETS FREE COLLEGE EDUCATION. THEY DON'T GET IN. IF THEY GET IN AND QUALIFY, THEY PAY NOTHING TO GO TO COLLEGE. SECONDLY, THERE ARE ALSO PROGRAMS THAT EXIST NOW THAT IF YOU PROVIDE FOR THE WORK, THAT YOU WILL VOLUNTEER TO DO SOMETHING IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, AND YOU DO IT FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE, YOU CAN DEDUCT $10,000 A YEAR UP TO $50,000 OFF OF THAT DEBT YOU HAVE. AND YOU HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAT HAVE GRADUATED. THE AVERAGE DEBT IS ABOUT $19,000 A YEAR. WELL, IT'S HARD AS HELL TO GET STARTED. HARD TO GET STARTED WHEN YOU HAVE THAT DEBT HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD. THE AVERAGE DEBT IS EVEN HIGHER. IT'S UP TO $28,000 A YEAR, SOMEONE GRADUATING FROM A FOUR YEAR SCHOOL. AND THAT'S WHY THE ECONOMISTS HAD PREDICTED PRIOR TO, AND I'LL END WITH THIS, I'M TELLING YOU TOO MUCH, BUT BECAUSE I'M PRETTY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS. WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF, IT WAS POINTED OUT BEFORE THE COVID CRISIS, THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN BECAUSE THE ENTIRE GENERATION, THIS FROM 9\/11 GENERATION THROUGH TO THE GENERATION NOW, AND COMING OUT OF THIS, THIS GOD-AWFUL CIRCUMSTANCE WE'RE IN, THEY, IN FACT, ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL BECAUSE OF STUDENT DEBT TO BE ABLE TO BORROW THE MONEY TO BUY A HOME, BUY A NEW VEHICLE, BUY AN APARTMENT, AND SPEND THE MONEY AND CAPITAL, WHERE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR ECONOMY IS DRIVEN BY CONSUMPTION, BY CONSUMPTION. AND THIS GENERATION, THIS WHOLE NEW GENERATION FROM 9\/11 ON, THAT IN FACT IS, THEY'RE NOT IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. SO THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF REASONS THAT ECONOMICALLY THIS WILL BENEFIT. THIS ISN'T JUST DRAINING MONEY. AND BY THE WAY, I PAY FOR EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS BY THE WAY, I DEAL WITH THE TAX STRUCTURE. BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY. SO THAT'S A PIECE OF WHAT I THINK WE CAN AND SHOULD BE DOING WITH HBCUS. AND SECONDLY, I WILL, IN MY ADMINISTRATION, ELEVATE, ELEVATE THE STANDING OF HBCUS BY THE PEOPLE IN MY ADMINISTRATION AS WELL. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. THE VICE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU, SO I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE SOMEONE THAT MIGHT HAVE A QUESTION FOR THIS FORUM. YES. HANNAH BONAPARTE: HI. THERE'S A MICROPHONE RIGHT THERE, AND THERE'S ONE ON THIS SIDE AS WELL. HANNAH BONAPARTE: HI, I'M HANNAH BONAPARTE. I JUST WAS LIKE WONDERING WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE? WE'RE GOING TO RAISE IT TO $15 AN HOUR NATIONALLY. I'VE BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN RAISING IT AS I'VE GONE AROUND THE COUNTRY WORKING WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT IN FACT HAVE RAISED IT, INCLUDING NEW YORK CITY AND OUT ON THE WEST COAST, AS WELL. HERE'S THE DEAL. IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN $15 AN HOUR WORKING 40 HOURS A WEEK, YOU'RE MAKING A WAGE UNDER THE POVERTY LEVEL. NO ONE IN AMERICA SHOULD BE WORKING FOR A 40-HOUR WEEK JOB AND STILL BE LIVING IN POVERTY. IT SHOULD NOT EXIST. NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, IT ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT IF WE PAY PEOPLE $15 AN HOUR AS A MINIMUM WAGE, YOU GROW THE ECONOMY. THE IDEA THAT THIS SOMEHOW PUTS PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS, THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THAT. WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE PEOPLE, IF YOU'RE MAKING 15 BUCKS AN HOUR INSTEAD OF $7 AN HOUR, YOU'RE ABLE TO BUY MORE THINGS. YOU'RE ABLE TO PAY MORE BILLS. YOU'RE ABLE TO DO MORE THAT ENDS UP INCREASING THE GDP, THE GROWTH OF THE WHOLE ECONOMY. SO IT'S NOT ONLY A GOOD THING FOR THE PERSON WHO IS GOING TO BE MAKING A DECENT WAGE FROM THE BEGINNING, BUT GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE. MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, \"GOD LOVE YOU, DEAR.\" [LAUGHTER] ANDREA BROWN: IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT, BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU, CHRIS, FOR BRINGING UP EDUCATION AND THE HBCUS, BUT AS FAR AS K-12 EDUCATION, HOW DO YOU PLAN TO PUSH ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL EQUITY? WELL, AS A SIMPLE PROPOSITION FOR ME, I DON'T EXAGGERATE AS A SECOND GRADE TEACHER, WHY YOU'RE SO IMPORTANT. IF I HAD ONLY $1 TO SPEND IN EDUCATION AND I COULD SPEND IT POST-GRADUATION OR PRE-KINDERGARTEN, I'D SPEND IT PRE-KINDERGARTEN. NOT A JOKE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO BASED ON YOUR EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND, THAT 60% OF A CHILD'S BRAIN IS ALREADY DEVELOPED BY THE TIME THEY'RE THREE, FOUR, FIVE YEARS OLD. ANDREA BROWN: RIGHT. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS, PEOPLE START OFF BASED ON THEIR ZIP CODE AND THEIR FAMILY BACKGROUND. THEY MAY START OFF WAY BEHIND THE CURVE. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO THEY COME INTO SCHOOL, IF THEY COME FROM A VERY POOR BACKGROUND IN A COMMUNITY RAISED BY A SINGLE MOM OR A SINGLE DAD, THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN, THEY WILL HAVE PROBABLY HEARD 1 MILLION FEWER WORDS SPOKEN BY THE TIME THEY GET TO FIRST GRADE. THAT BY ITSELF IS AN IMPEDIMENT. NOBODY'S FORCED THAT ON ANYBODY, BUT WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE IT. AND SO THE WAY TO CHANGE IT IS THREEFOLD. NUMBER ONE, AS I SAID, PROVIDE FOR EARLY EDUCATION, STARTING AT THREE YEARS OF AGE, AND IT'S NOT , THIS IS YOU THINK, \"OH MY LORD, WHY WE HAVE A THREE-YEAR-OLD GO TO SCHOOL?\" THEY LEARN AS RAPIDLY AS A SIX-YEAR-OLD, A 12-YEAR-OLD, A 14-YEAR-OLD. AND THEY JUST SUCK IT ALL UP. THEY JUST SUCK IT ALL UP. NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PAY TEACHERS ENOUGH MONEY TO STAY IN THE BUSINESS OF TEACHING. MY WIFE'S A FULL-TIME TEACHER. MY WIFE HAS NEVER STOPPED. AS FIRST LADY, AS THE SECOND LADY, I SHOULD SAY, SHE TAUGHT 15 CREDITS EVERY SEMESTER AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. BEFORE THAT, SHE TAUGHT JUNIORS AND SENIORS IN HIGH SCHOOL FOR 25 YEARS. I THINK IT WAS 25. MY POINT IS, A LONG TIME. ALTHOUGH, I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TELL THE EXACT NUMBER BECAUSE MY WIFE IS 30 YEARS YOUNGER THAN I AM. I STARTED OFF NOT QUITE THAT MUCH. THERE'S NO WOMAN IN THE ENTIRE BIDEN FAMILY AS OLD AS ANY MAN, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE. ALL KIDDING ASIDE, THE FACT IS THAT IT IS THE LIFEBLOOD , PEOPLE, THEY SAY, THESE CHILDREN , THEY ARE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. THEY ARE THE KITE STRINGS THAT LIFT OUR NATIONAL AMBITIONS ALOFT. IT'S BIZARRE, CRAZY FOR US. IN EVERY SINGLE EMPIRICAL STUDY DONE, THE MORE MONEY YOU SPEND, THE BETTER YOU EDUCATE A CHILD THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, THE BETTER THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE IS. EVERYBODY, ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT'S WHY WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE FOR MORE DIRECT FUNDING FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS. AS YOU KNOW, BETTER THAN MOST WILL KNOW, THE BULK OF ALL THE FUNDING, IF YOUR SCHOOL USES LOCAL FUNDING IT'S NOT NATIONAL FUNDING. IT'S NOT FEDERAL FUNDING. BUT FEDERAL FUNDING CAN FOCUS ON PARTICULAR NEEDS WITHIN SCHOOLS. ONE OF THOSE IS ACCESS TO EQUAL EDUCATION IN THE EARLY GRADES AND NOT BE DETERMINED BY YOUR ZIP CODE. THAT REQUIRES US TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON SCHOOLS THAT IN FACT, AND , TEACHERS LOOK, I'M NOT , GOING TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU MAKE. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT ALL THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN A STUDENT BODY WHERE THERE'S STUDENTS OF COLOR, IT MAKES A GIGANTIC DIFFERENCE IF THERE ARE TEACHERS OF COLOR, PARTICULARLY MALE TEACHERS OF COLOR. MR. BIDEN: A GIGANTIC DIFFERENCE. IT'S JUST A FACTUAL PREDICATE. WE HAVE TO ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION TO ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR TO GET IN AND TEACH. THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS TO RAISE THE SALARIES. RAISE THE SALARIES. I MEAN, IDEA THAT A TEACHER IS OUT THERE AFTER SEVERAL YEARS MAKING $40,000 YOU HAVE, , PROBABLY, A STUDENT DEBT LARGER THAN THAT. ENOUGH, FOR REAL. THAT'S WHY THE LAST PIECE OF THE STUDENT DEBT. ANYBODY WHO HAS A STUDENT DEBT WHO TEACHES, THAT COUNTS AS WORKING FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST. YOU GET TO DEDUCT OF THAT $10,000 STUDENT DEBT PER YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS, AND UP TO $50,000 IF YOU'RE TEACHING. WE CAN AFFORD THIS, BY THE WAY. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE , JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE IDEA HERE. I CARRY THIS CARD WITH ME BECAUSE EVERYBODY SAYS, \"WELL, BIDEN'S GOING TO RAISE ALL TAXES, AND EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE, AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO HERE , \" LET'S SEE IF I CAN FIND IT. IF I HAVE IT HERE. ANYWAY, I HAVE A LIST OF HOW I WILL FUND EVERY SINGLE THING THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE JUST MADE CORPORATIONS NOT PAY 21%, AND 91 OF THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES PAY NO TAX, ZERO, ZERO, OKAY, NONE , IF WE JUST MADE THEM PAY 28%, IT USED TO BE 38%, WE MAKE THEM PAY 28%, AND EVERYBODY HAD TO PAY IT, THAT WOULD RAISE A TOTAL OF $1,370,000,000,000. I'M NOT TRYING TO PUNISH ANYBODY. IT'S TIME FOR EVERYBODY TO START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. PRESIDENT HAS A NEW PROPOSAL. SOME OF YOU MAY LIKE IT. I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD KNOW IT WORKS VERY WELL, AND THAT IS ANOTHER $30 BILLION TAX CUT FOR BILLIONAIRES. YOU THINK I'M MAKING IT LIKE BILLIONAIRE. I SOUND LIKE BERNIE SANDERS, \"BILLIONAIRES ARE BAD. \" THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM. PROBLEM IS IN REDUCING THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX, IF YOU MAKE YOUR MONEY OFF INVESTMENTS AS OPPOSED TO SWEATING YOUR BROW OR WALKING UP AND GETTING A PAYCHECK, RIGHT, HE THINKS YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO PAY 15% OF YOUR INCOME. YOU'LL PAY MORE AS A SCHOOL TEACHER THAN SOMEBODY MAKING $20 MILLION BUCKS. IT'S ALL COMING FROM INVESTMENTS. IT'S NOT RIGHT. DON'T WANT TO PUNISH ANYBODY. JUST ABOUT TIME EVERYBODY PAYS THEIR FAIR SHARE. THE WAY I DO THAT IS I RAISE THE TAX BACK FOR MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES TO 39.4%. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT 90%. THAT'S NOT TRUE. IT WAS 39.4% WHEN BUSH WAS PRESIDENT. YOU JUST RAISE THAT TAX RATE BACK UP TO 39.4%. THAT RAISES 6%. THAT RAISES $90 BILLION. JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. THERE'S MUCH MORE I COULD TALK, BUT MY POINT IS IT WILL NOT BY THE WAY, I WENT TO UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE SCHOOL. I WAS VERY FLATTERED THAT, I THINK IT'S 14 NOBEL LAUREATES IN ECONOMICS, JUST ENDORSED ME, AND SAID MY PLANS MAKE SENSE. ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT BIDEN'S GOING TO BANKRUPT THE COUNTRY AND BIDEN IS GOING TO SPEND $400 BILLION, AND YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES, NOT TRUE. WE CAN DO IT ALL BY JUST SOMEBODY JUST STARTING TO PAY YOUR FAIR SHARE. THAT'S ALL. THAT'S ALL. GIVE PEOPLE WHO NEED A BREAK, A BREAK. THANK YOU. HELLO. NICE TO MEET YOU. MY NAME IS SUBRINA COLLIER. MY HUSBAND AND I, CHEF GREG COLLIER, OWN RESTAURANTS HERE IN CHARLOTTE. ONE, UPTOWN YOLK, AND ONE HERE IN CAMP NORTH END, LEAH AND LOUISE. AS YOU KNOW, THE RESTAURANTS HAVE BEEN HIT SEVERELY HARD THE PAST , I THINK IT BE SEVEN MONTHS NOW? A LOT OF US, WHICH ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND SMALL MINORITY BUSINESS OWNERS, DIDN'T RECEIVE AS MUCH RELIEF, NATIONALLY. THE CITY OF CHARLOTTE HAS BEEN AMAZING WITH OFFERING GRANTS AND THINGS THAT WE CAN FLOAT US OVER AND STILL PAY OUR EMPLOYEES, BUT WE STILL HAD TO CUT STAFF. WE STILL HAD TO CUT HOURS. WHAT WOULD BE THE RELIEF FOR A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, SPECIFICALLY RESTAURANTS? IS THERE A PLAN TO GIVE US SOME TYPE OF RELIEF? I DON'T KNOW, A TAX CUT, ANYTHING. YES. THERE WAS A BIG PLAN TO DO IT. THERE'S A MODAL PLAN. FIRST OF ALL, THE CARES ACT, WHICH PASSED OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE, WHICH WAS A TOTAL OF $2 TRILLION OVERALL, TWICE, WAS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE WHAT THEY CALLED THE MAIN STREET LENDING PROGRAM. FOR FOUR MONTHS, IT DIDN'T LEND A PENNY. NONE OF THE MONEY WENT OUT, NUMBER ONE, BECAUSE YOU GOT 20 REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE WHO SAID THEY DON'T WANT TO DEPEND ANYTHING ON ANYTHING, FOR REAL. THE PRESIDENT WHO HAS, AS I SAID, FIRED THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING FOR CERTAIN. SECONDLY, ON THE EARLY PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. THE SMALL BUSINESS IS DEFINED OF FEWER THAN 50 EMPLOYEES. NOW, MOST SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE NEIGHBORHOOD SMALL BUSINESSES ARE 10 OR FEWER EMPLOYEES. WHAT I PROPOSE IS WE FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT THE MONEY GOES DIRECTLY TO THOSE BUSINESSES THAT IN FACT PROVIDE FOR BEING ABLE TO KEEP THEIR EMPLOYEES ON THE PAYROLL FOR THE 10 OR FEWER EMPLOYEES. THAT'S A PRIORITY, AND THEN 50 AND UNDER. HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENED. WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT NOT ONLY HAS THAT NOT OCCURRED, A LOT OF THE MONEY HAS GONE TO VERY BIG BUSINESSES THAT DIDN'T , I MEAN, THEY MAY NEED IT, BUT THEY DIDN'T NEED IT TO STAY ALIVE. EVEN WHEN THEY GOT IT, WHAT DID THEY DO? THE COMMITMENT THAT I PROPOSED, AND WE THOUGHT WE HAD DONE, IS THAT RIGHT NOW, IF YOU GET A GOVERNMENT BAILOUT, QUOTE, UNQUOTE, \"LOAN TO STAY ALIVE,\" WHAT YOU CANNOT DO IS TAKE THAT MONEY AND EITHER BUY BACK YOUR OWN STOCK AND, OR INCREASE YOUR SALARIES WITH THAT MONEY. IT'S TO KEEP PEOPLE EMPLOYED, KEEP THEM ON A PAYROLL. SECONDLY , AND THAT IS WHAT A LOT OF THE BUSINESSES HAVE DONE. THEY BUY BACK THEIR OWN STOCK, INCREASING THE NET WORTH OF THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE STOCK, AND IN FACT, PAY THEIR SALARIES BASED ON STOCK THEN. THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT, NUMBER ONE, WITH GOVERNMENT MONEY, BAILING PEOPLE OUT. SECONDLY, A LOT OF YOU DON'T KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCE. NOW THERE'S NO NATIONAL STANDARDS AS TO HOW TO OPEN. HOW DO YOU OPEN SAFELY? PRESIDENT SAYS, \"JUST PUT UP A SIGN, COME ON IN.\" WELL, YOU KNOW YOUR EMPLOYEE. BEYOND YOUR EMPLOYEES, YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO GO, \"I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, DOES EVERYBODY HAVE TO HAVE THE MASK? DO THEY HAVE DIVIDERS IN THE RESTAURANT? TELL ME HOW THE SANITARY CONDITIONS ARE WORKING.\" WELL, WELL, YOU NEED MONEY TO PAY FOR ALL THAT STUFF. THAT'S WHY WE PROPOSED TO HAVE A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM WHERE BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO GET THE MONEY, NOT BORROW THE MONEY, GET THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO OPEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC, INCLUDING FIXING THE TESTING FIASCO. YOU SHOULD BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOUR EMPLOYEES CAN, IN 24 HOURS, GET A TEST TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE. YOU NEED TO DO THAT FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION, AND THE PUBLIC LIKES TO KNOW THAT IS PROTECTION THAT THERE ARE PROTECTION AGAINST ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS WITHIN YOUR RESTAURANT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE MONEY IS ALREADY THERE. THE PRESIDENT IS JUST NOT RELEASING IT. DEPARTMENT IS NOT RELEASING THE MONEY. IT'S ALL DONE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE ECONOMY MOVING. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE ON UNEMPLOYMENT, OVER 30 MILLION IN UNEMPLOYMENT. HOW IN GOD'S NAME ARE WE GOING TO GENERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH UNLESS WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP THESE PEOPLE BACK AND HELP YOU GET BACK IN BUSINESS? IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH SCHOOLS. HOW MANY SCHOOLS ARE NOT OPENING BECAUSE THERE ARE NO NATIONAL STANDARDS SET? NO NATIONAL STANDARDS SET. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS AN OUTFIT , AM I TELLING YOU TOO MUCH? YOU WANT ME TO STOP? OKAY. I'M REALLY GOOD AT THIS. THIS DRIVES ME CRAZY. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK, THERE IS NO NATIONAL STANDARD FOR HOW TO OPEN SCHOOLS, HOW TO OPEN THEM SAFELY, BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT SAYS, \"I HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY. THAT'S NOT MY RESPONSE , \" LITERALLY, THAT IS HIS PHRASE. \"IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY. I'M NOT THE BLAME FOR ANY OF THIS. LET THE GOVERNORS OR THE MAYORS TAKE CARE OF IT,\" AND THEN WITHOUT THE FINANCIAL HELP THAT'S NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF IT. I'VE LAID OUT IN DETAIL BACK IN JULY, WHAT WE'D HAVE TO DO TO OPEN SAFELY AND INCLUDES PROVIDING THE PROTECTIVE PPE, THE MASK, AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED, GLOVES, ET CETERA, FOR THE SCHOOLS, THE SCHOOL TEACHERS, AND FOR THE CHILDREN COMING TO SCHOOL. SECONDLY, YOU HAVE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN ONE ROOM. YOU HAVE TO HAVE MODULES THAT ARE SMALLER. FOR THAT, YOU NEED MORE TEACHERS, NOT FEWER TEACHERS. YOU GOT TO PAY MORE TEACHERS. NUMBER THREE, YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO SANITIZE THE SCHOOLS, WHETHER IT'S EVERYTHING FROM THE WATER FOUNTAIN TO THE LAVATORY, OR JUST THE SURFACES THAT ARE TOUCHED, AND WHAT IS BREATHED ON BY PEOPLE. THAT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO DO THAT, LIKE IT WOULD FOR A RESTAURANT AS WELL FOR YOU TO HAVE TO DO THAT. THE MONEY IS THERE, AVAILABLE, TO DO THAT, BUT THE PRESIDENT REFUSES. WHAT HE SAYS IS JUST OPEN UP AND MAKE SURE THAT , SCHOOL SHOULD JUST OPEN UP. IT ALSO RELATES TO HOW FAR DOWN YOU'VE GOT THE REINFECTION RATE. IF IT'S DOWN BELOW ONE, THEN IT'S RATIONAL. YOU CAN, WITH THOSE PROTECTIONS, GO AHEAD AND OPEN A SCHOOL, BUT WATCH IT VERY CLOSELY. IT REQUIRES TESTING AND TRACING TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE STILL ON COURSE THERE. LOOK, THE OTHER THING IS THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THE FEMA, THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY , THEY HAD AGREED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO PROVIDE MASKS FOR SCHOOLS. THEY STARTED TO HAND THEM OUT TO SCHOOLS. WELL, GUESS WHAT? THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T LIKE THAT, OR SOMEBODY DIDN'T LIKE THAT. THEY SAID, THE RULING WAS MADE, \"OPENING SCHOOLS SAFELY IS NOT A NATIONAL EMERGENCY,\" SO THEY STOPPED IT. REFUSING TO EVEN PROVIDE MASKS FOR SCHOOLS BECAUSE IT'S NOT A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. WELL, IF THIS ISN'T A NATIONAL EMERGENCY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS. THE WAY WE'RE DOING THIS IS THE WAY , I WILL END WITH THIS. THE PRESIDENT WAS IN OHIO, I GUESS A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AT A RALLY. I DON'T WANT TO MISQUOTE HIM. AND HE SAID AT THE RALLY AND I WROTE THIS DOWN, HE SAID THAT \"WE VIRTUALLY TURNED THE CORNER. NOBODY IS REALLY DYING.\" HE SAID, \"YEAH, ELDERLY PEOPLE ARE DYING AND THEY'RE DYING BECAUSE THEY HAVE HEART CONDITIONS,\" OR OTHER, BUT QUOTE UNQUOTE, \"VIRTUALLY, THEY'RE VIRTUALLY NOBODIES. THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES DYING.\" SO YOU GO HOME AND YOUR MOM IS GONE, YOUR DAD'S GONE. HE'S A VIRTUAL NOBODY? THE IDEA, THE WAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE, AND THIS IS ALL WITHIN OUR POWER TO DO SOMETHING. THE VIRUS WASN'T HIS FAULT, BUT THE WAY HE'S HANDLED IT HAS BEEN CLOSE TO CRIMINAL. AND SO MANY PEOPLE BREAKING THEIR NECKS AND BY THE WAY, MY DECEASED WIFE, WHEN I FIRST GOT MARRIED, I MARRIED A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN FROM SYRACUSE, NEW YORK, SKANEATELES, NEW YORK. AND I GOT ELECTED AND I WAS 29-YEARS-OLD. I COME FROM A VERY MODEST FAMILY. NOT BRAGGING ABOUT IT, BUT I WAS LISTED AS THE POOREST MAN IN CONGRESS FOR 36 YEARS. BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO EARN ANY MONEY WHILE YOU'RE THERE OTHER THAN YOUR SALARY. AND THEN WHEN I GOT ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT, ONE OF THE PRESS OUTLETS SAID, \"IT'S PROBABLE NO MAN HAS EVER BEEN ASSUMING THE OFFICE OF VICE PRESIDENT WITH FEWER ASSETS THAN JOE BIDEN.\" I I HOPE THEY WEREN'T TALKING INTELLECTUAL ASSETS. WHEN I GOT ELECTED WHEN I WAS 29, I WAS IN WASHINGTON BEFORE I WAS SWORN IN AND I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM MY FIRE DEPARTMENT SAYING MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER HAVE JUST BEEN KILLED. AND MY TWO BOYS WERE NOT LIKELY TO MAKE IT. A TRACTOR TRAILER BROADSIDED THEM WHILE THEY WERE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. AND AT THE TIME, MY WIFE'S FATHER, MY FATHER-IN-LAW, HE CAME HOME FROM WORLD WAR II AND HE HAD OWNED A RESTAURANT. HE WAS A COOK IN WORLD WAR II IN THE NAVY AND HE ENDED UP OPENING UP A RESTAURANT IN A PLACE CALLED AUBURN, NEW YORK, A TOWN ABOUT 20,000 PEOPLE, JUST SOUTH OF SYRACUSE. AND IT BECAME THE MEETING PLACE FOR EVERYBODY. IT'S A PLACE THAT DOCTORS WOULD START OFF THE MORNING GETTING THEIR COFFEE AND THE LAWYERS WOULD HAVE THEIR LUNCH AND KIDS AFTER GRADUATIONS WOULD COME TO THIS CALLED THE HUNTER DINERANT , AND THEN HE OPENED UP OTHER RESTAURANTS. AND IN ORDER TO TRY TO CONVINCE ME TO STAY, I DON'T BLAME HIM. I DO THE SAME WITH MY DAUGHTER. TRY TO CONVINCE AFTER HE GRADUATED TO TAKE A JOB IN UPSTATE NEW YORK, RATHER THAN GO BACK TO DELAWARE. HE OFFERED ME HIS PRIZE DINER. AND HE WAS MAKING AT THAT TIME, I WOULD HAVE MADE FIVE TIMES WHAT I MADE AS A LAWYER. A STARTING LAWYER SALARY IS SIX , $6,000 AND IT WAS $30,000 A YEAR. BUT THE PROBLEM WAS FOR THREE YEARS, I HAD FIVE YEARS I WATCHED HOW HARD HE WORKED. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT. YOU GOT TO LOVE IT. EVEN IN GOOD TIMES THEY THINK YOU'RE CRAZY. IT'S 24 HOURS A DAY, BUT YOU DESERVE A BREAK AND YOUR EMPLOYEES DESERVE A BREAK. AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE FIGHTING SO HARD TO KEEP THEM ON A JOB IS A TESTAMENT TO THE KIND OF PEOPLE YOU ARE. BUT I PROMISE YOU, I GUARANTEE YOU IF I'M ELECTED, YOU'LL GET BOTH THE PPE. YOU'LL GET ALSO THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO OPEN AND THE ADDITIONAL MONEY, NOT ONLY TO MAINTAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES, BUT TO MAINTAIN AN OPEN PLACE THAT YOU IN FACT CAN. I'VE MET WITH A LOT OF RESTAURATEURS UP AND AROUND THE COUNTRY SO THEY CAN OPEN UP AND DO EVERYTHING FROM HAVING PLASTIC SHIELDS IN FRONT OF THE CASHIERS, TO A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAKE IT SAFE, MAKE IT SAFE, AND YOU'LL GET THE HELP. I USED TO BE A CITY COUNCIL WHEN I RAN FOR THE SENATE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO HARD. THEY KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE. MALCOLM GRAHAM: EXACTLY. FIRST, I WANT TO THANK YOU. YOU HONORED ME AND MY FAMILY BY SENDING A VIDEO TRIBUTE FOR MY SISTER, CYNTHIA GRAHAM HURD. OH MY LORD, I APOLOGIZE. I DIDN'T KNOW. I'M SORRY. MALCOLM GRAHAM: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. AS YOU KNOW, KILLED AT THE EMANUEL AME CHURCH SHOOTING IN CHARLESTON. AND SO MY QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU REIMAGINE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND SPECIFICALLY THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION AFTER FOUR YEARS OF TRUMP? WELL, FIRST OF ALL, AND I GUESS I'LL JUST SAY IT. THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST CORRUPT ADMINISTRATION IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS TURNED INTO THE PRESIDENT'S PRIVATE LAW FIRM. HE ACTUALLY HAS THEM REPRESENTING HIM ON WOMEN WHO ACCUSED HIM OF RAPE. WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM? AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION WILL BE TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF ME. I WILL NOT DIRECT THEM WHO TO PROSECUTE, HOW TO PROSECUTE, WHAT TO PROSECUTE. AND I WILL NOT BE INJECTING. I WILL NOT ENTER THEIR DECISIONS BASED UPON THE JUDGMENTS THEY MAKE ABOUT WHAT CASES THEY BRING AND THEY DON'T BRING. WITH REGARD TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION, I WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE TWO THINGS. ONE, CIVIL RIGHTS PRESENCE IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ELEVATED SO IT HAS ACCESS TO AND TRANSPARENCY TO ALL POLICE DEPARTMENTS' ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. JUST SO THEY ARE AWARE THAT IT'S TRANSPARENT WHAT'S GOING ON. I WOULD ALSO MAKE SURE THAT I ELEVATE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, EXCUSE ME, THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION TO HAVE A DIRECT OFFICE WITH INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. WHEN, FOR EXAMPLE, I'M THE GUY THAT WROTE THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. WHEN THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME WHAT I WANTED AS VICE PRESIDENT, I SAID, \"I WANT TO HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THAT ACT INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE.\" BECAUSE IT ELEVATES THE STANDING OF WHATEVER THAT OFFICE THAT COMES INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. SO I WOULD MAKE SURE THERE'S A COMBINATION OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION HAVING MORE DIRECT AUTHORITY INSIDE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND BEING ABLE TO INVESTIGATE THAN IN FACT IT HAS NOW. BUT MOST OF ALL, MOST OF ALL, I WOULD HAVE AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO UNDERSTOOD HIS OATH OF OFFICE. IT'S NOT A JOKE. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS THE OATH OF OFFICE THAT IN FACT COULD DO AND MOVE ON WHAT THE PROFESSIONALS IN THE DEPARTMENT THOUGHT HAD TO BE PURSUED WITHOUT MY INTERFERING TO SAY, \"NO, THEY'RE MY FRIENDS\" OR \"I KNOW THEM\" OR \"GO AFTER THIS PERSON. GO AFTER HILLARY,\" YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THIS KIND OF STUFF. I GET ASKED THE QUESTION ALL THE TIME BY THE PRESS THAT TRAVELS WITH ME, ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE THE SAME ONES THAT ARE TRAVELING TODAY HAVE ASKED IT, BUT I GET ASKED THE FOLLOWING QUESTION. \"IF IN FACT YOU GET ELECTED, WOULD YOU PROSECUTE TRUMP? WOULD YOU PURSUE PROSECUTING TRUMP?\" AND THE ANSWER IS, I'M NOT GOING TO PURSUE PROSECUTING ANYBODY. I'M GOING TO DO WHAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS SHOULD BE DONE, SHOULD BE DONE AND NOT POLITICIZE IT. IT'S THE MOST DANGEROUS THING THAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR IS THE POLITICIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. IT'S BECOME THE DEPARTMENT OF TRUMP AND THAT'S WRONG. THANK YOU MR. VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE VERY, VERY HEARTFELT FEELINGS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR HAVING POLICIES THAT REALLY FOLLOW WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON. SO ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE TODAY, THANK YOU FOR GIVING US YOUR TIME, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, GIVING US THE CHANGES THAT YOU SEE FOR OUR COUNTRY. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. WHO'S THE FELLOW WHO RUNS 26 ORGANIZATIONS FOR HOUSING? PUBLIC? I KNOW WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO TALK. BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS INCREDIBLY CONSEQUENTIAL. AND I LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PAPER ON THE WAY OUT OF WHAT I THINK WE CAN AND SHOULD DO. IT'S VERY DETAILED AND I'D LOVE YOUR FEEDBACK. I'LL PUT A PHONE NUMBER ON IT, OKAY? BECAUSE IT IS A GIGANTIC, GIGANTIC, GIGANTIC UNDERTAKING. AND UNLESS WE CAN GET PEOPLE INTO HOUSING, UNLESS WE CAN PROVIDE FOR HOUSING, UNLESS WE CAN STOP THE GENTRIFICATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE LEFT OUT, THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE IN REAL TROUBLE. AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS REALLY , I'M NOT TRYING TO BOOST HIM. I'VE NEVER MET THE GENTLEMAN, BUT I DID READ YOUR BIO AND WHAT YOU'RE WORKING ON. AND I'D REALLY LIKE YOUR INPUT AND MAY ABLE TO CALL YOU IF I COULD, AFTER YOU GET WHAT I'M PROPOSING IN DETAIL AND SEE WHAT WE CAN WORK OUT. AND PART OF THE REASON I DO THIS AND WHAT I MISS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO DO LARGER ENGAGEMENTS IS THIS IS WHERE I LEARN. I'M A TACTICAL GUY. I MEAN, I'D RATHER BE SHAKING YOUR HAND AND LOOKING YOU IN THE EYE AND YOU TELLING ME WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND DON'T BE RELUCTANT AT ALL TO CRITICIZED MY PLAN IF YOU THINK IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I THINK IT'S PRETTY GOOD. I'VE WORKED ON IT REALLY, REALLY HARD. IT GOES FROM SECTION 8 HOUSING ALL THE WAY TO FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS, TO THE WHOLE NOTION OF THESE , ANYWAY, I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU BEFORE I LEAVE, OKAY? YOU'RE VERY POLITE TO SIT HERE ALL THIS TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU EVERYBODY. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, I UNDERSTAND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GROUP PHOTO, SO EVERYBODY HAS THEIR MASK ON AND I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE PHOTOGRAPHER ON TOP OF THE LADDER. SO DOES EVERYONE TURN AND MR. VICE PRESIDENT , CHRIS? DON'T JUMP.

MOST OF THE CASES THE COURT PICKS UP AND HERE'S ARE GOING TO BE DECIDED ON MUCH LARGER MAJORITY BASIS. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAN JUST SIMPLY EXPANDING OR PACKING THE COURT TO GET AROUND A MAJORITY YOU DON'T LIKE. THIS RELATES TO CONGRESS. CONGRESS HAS A LOT OF POWER HERE. THE PEOPLE ARE NOT POWERLESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIRECT SAY OVER WHO SIX IN CONGRESS AND THEY CAN MAKE THEIR VIEWS KNOWN TO THE REPRESENTATIVES IN WE LEAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH JAMES WALLNER TO BRING YOU LIVE COVERAGE OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN'S REMARKS AT THE 2020 FALL LEADERSHIP MEETING AT THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS. THIS IS LIVE COVERAGE ON C-SPAN. I CAN SAY THAT I DID IT, YOU KNOW, I RAN FOR THE SENATE BECAUSE WE NEED YOU. BUT THE QUALITY OF LIVES IS SO MUCH IT IN YOUR HANDS ON YOUR SHOULDERS THAN ANYONE ELSE, MAKING SURE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE WALKING DOWN THE STREET, MAKING SURE GARBAGE GETS COLLECTED, MAKING SCHOOL SAFES ARE OPENS ARE SAFE AND OPEN. EVERYDAY LIFE THINGS, THEY ARE NOT PARTISAN THINGS, THEY ARE JUST PRACTICAL THINGS. PEOPLE LOOK TO YOU, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. YOU KNOW, YOU ARE ALSO ON THE FRONT LINES OF EMERGENCIES, FROM FIRES TO FLOODS TO SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, HELPING TO SAVE LIVES AS WELL AS LIVELIHOODS. THAT IS WHY I MADE IT A PRIORITY FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER TO WORK CLOSELY WITH YOU, FROM THE TIME I GOT TO THE SENATE 180 YEARS AGO. [LAUGHS] AS WELL AS MY TENURE AS VICE PRESIDENT. IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BECOMING A PRESIDENT, I SPEAK THIS COMMITMENT TO YOU , YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS DIRECTLY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I AM GOING TO BE RIGHT THERE WITH YOU, HELPING YOU AND YOUR COMMUNITIES BASED ON WHAT YOU THINK YOU NEED AND THE CHALLENGES YOU ARE FACING. BECAUSE THE PRESENT MAYOR POINTED OUT IT IS ABOUT THE BOTTOM UP. IT DOES NOT GO FROM THE TOP DOWN. WE ARE DEALING WITH FOUR HISTORIC CRISES ALL AT ONCE, A ONCE IN A CENTURY PANDEMIC THAT HAS CLAIMED OVER 200,000 AMERICAN LIVES, A DEVASTATING ECONOMIC RECESSION, A LONG-OVERDUE RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE, A CLIMATE CHANGE THAT IS RAVAGING COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I NEED NOT TELL IT TO MAYORS IN CALIFORNIA, OREGON, AND WASHINGTON STATE. NOT ONE OF THOSE CRISES SHOULD HAVE A PARTISAN DIMENSION. I REALLY MEAN THAT. NOT ONE SINGLE ONE. IF I GET ELECTED PRESIDENT, I AM NOT GOING TO BE THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, I AM GOING TO BE THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR ME OR AGAINST ME, WHETHER YOUR CITY IS RED OR BLUE, I WILL BE THERE FOR YOU, I PROMISE YOU. LEADING WITH THE FACTS AND WITH REALITY, PUTTING THE WELL-BEING OF OUR CONSTITUENTS FIRST, UNITING PEOPLE AROUND SOLUTIONS THAT WORK FOR EVERYBODY. TRAGICALLY, THAT IS NOT HOW THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS WIRED. THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS WITH THIS PRESIDENT IS A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS YOU PERSONALLY. THE DEVISE EVERYTHING INTO RED AND BLUE, BLUE STATES, RED STATES, DEMOCRATIC STATES. I THINK THAT IS WHY THE DAY BEFORE WE HELD 200,000 DEATHS, THE PRESIDENT HELD A CAMPAIGN RALLY AND INSISTED THE VIRUS WAS, QUOTE, \"AFFECT VIRTUALLY NOBODY,\" AND THEN WENT ON TO SAY, QUOTE, \" EXCEPT PEOPLE WITH HEART CONDITIONS AND OTHER PROBLEMS.\" TO BE REFERRED TO BY THE PRESIDENT AS \"NOBODY'S,\" ASK THEM ABOUT THE ANTI-SEAT AT THE KITCHEN TABLE. KIDS WHO LOST THEIR TEACHERS, FRIENDS AND GRANDPARENTS, COWORKERS, SISTERS AND BROTHERS, THEY WILL NOT SEE AGAIN. THE POLICIES WILL AFFECT ALL OF US, EVERY ONE OF US, IN EVERY COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS MAY BE THE TOUGHEST TIME IN A LONG TIME TO BE A MAYOR, ESPECIALLY A BIG CITY MAYOR, IN FACT, I AM SURE IT IS TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD. MAYORS HAVE FACED ADVERSITY BEFORE. SOME MAY REMEMBER IN 2008, THE ECONOMY WAS IN FREEFALL. WE WERE LOSING 700,000 JOBS A MONTH BECAUSE OF THE RECESSION. FAMILIES LOST , AND I KNOW YOU REMEMBER THIS , FAMILIES LOST MORE THAN $16 TRILLION , FAMILIES , IN PERSONAL WEALTH. PEOPLE WHO HAD NEVER MISSED A MORTGAGE PAYMENT ALL OF A SUDDEN WERE UNDERWATER, BEING FORECLOSED ON, BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF FORECLOSURES THAT OCCURRED ON OUR STREETS, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE VALUE OF THEIR HOME. IT WAS DEVASTATING. WE DID NOT SOLVE IT BY SAYING, \"YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. IT IS WHAT IT IS.\" . WITH YOURWE WERE TOGETHER. WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP, WE PASSED THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT. KEEPING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIREFIGHTERS ON THE JOB. WE SENT MORE THAN $50 BILLION TO SCHOOL DISTRICT, SAVING MORE THAN 300,000 EDUCATION JOBS. WE PROVIDED MIDDLE-CLASS TAX RELIEF, HELPING FAMILIES TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE, TO BUY THEIR FIRST HOME. WE INVESTED IN THE FUTURE. WE PUT 48 BILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, BUILDING 42,000 MILES OF ROAD. NEARLY 27,000 BRIDGES TO GO ALONG WITH THE BIGGEST CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENT IN ALL OF OUR HISTORY. I SAT SAID IT THEN, AND I WILL SAY AGAIN, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT YOUR CITY MOST NEEDS. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH YOUR STATE LEGISLATURE AND ALL OF THAT. YOU SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. EVEN CONSERVATIVE ECONOMISTS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT WE DID SAVED US FROM A DEPRESSION. WHEN THE PRESIDENT GAVE ME THE HONOR OF LEADING THE RECOVERY EFFORT, THE FIRST THING I DID, I WENT TO THE MAYORS. SOME OF YOU WERE STILL AROUND THEN. I SPOKE WITH OVER 200 MAYORS. BECAUSE OF YOU, WE CAME THROUGH THE MOMENT TOGETHER. I REALLY MEAN IT. I WAS ON THE PHONE CONSTANTLY. THAT AT THE SAME APPROACH WE SHOULD BE TAKING TODAY. IT STARTS WITH THE BUDGET. YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. WE ARE GETTING SQUEEZED LIKE NEVER BEFORE. LOCAL SERVICES GETTING PARED BACK, IT IS A POLL JOBS ARE FALLING BY THE WAYSIDE, FURLOUGHS AND LAYOFFS COMPOUNDING THE DEVASTATION. WE STILL HAVE NO EFFECTIVE NATIONAL STANDARD FOR CURBING THE VIRUS. THIS IS INFURIATING. THE SCIENCE INSISTS WE COULD SAVE 110,000 , WE ARE EXPECTING CLOSE TO 200,000 MORE LIVES LOST BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY. WE COULD SAVE 110,000 BY DATE OF JANUARY BY SIMPLY WEARING MASKS. AND THAT IS STRAINING YOUR BUDGETS EVEN MORE, BECAUSE IT KEEPS BUSINESSES FROM OPENING EVEN MORE, IT KEEPS EMERGENCY ROOMS FALL, HOLDING DOWN CITIES FROM SPRINGING BACK TO LIFE. THERE IS NO REASON , NONE , THAT WE CAN'T WORK TOGETHER, WE CAN'T WORK TOGETHER TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES. YOU KNOW, THE HOUSE PASSED THE H.E.R.O.E.S. ACT, WHICH PROVIDED $915 BILLION IN LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS. IT IS COLLECTING DUST RIGHT NOW IN THE SENATE. THE MAJORITY LEADER, WHO I KNOW WELL, SAYS, \"LET THE STATES GO BANKRUPT.\" WE SHOULD HAVE AN LOCAL EMERGENCY FUND THAT DRIVES RESOURCES STRAIGHT TO YOU, EXPANDS YOUR HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE, REIMBURSES OVERTIME PAY TWO ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS. WHATEVER YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS , WHATEVER YOUR COMMUNITY NEEDS THE MOST, IT IS NOT ALL ABOUT RESOURCES, THE. THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE CRYING OUT FOR JUSTICE, EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO PEACEFULLY PROTEST, FALLING ON YOU TO KEEP THE PEACE, AND, GOD, IT IS A TOUGH JOB UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN THE PRESIDENT SCAPEGOATS MAYORS AND FANS THE FLAMES OF VISIONS. DIVISION. WE CAN COMBAT VIOLENCE WHILE STILL ADDRESSING THE PAIN AND ROOTING OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM. AND ALL AS YOU ALL DEAL WITH THE EFFECTS OF EXTREME WEATHER , FIRES, FLOODS, SUPERSTORM'S , IT IS LIKE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN. YOU KNOW, WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES, TO MAKE THEM MORE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. IN SOME PLACES, IT IS ABOUT FLOODING. IN SOME PLACES, IT IS ABOUT THE WIPED OUT BY STORMS, ALONG THE COAST WHERE I LIVE. SOMETIMES IT IS JUST KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE FROM FIRES. BUT IT ALSO IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS, MODERNIZING YOUR BUILDINGS AND YOUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, MAKING YOUR COMMUNITY STRONGER, GREENER, BETTER POSITIONED TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE YEARS AHEAD. THAT IS WHAT I PLAN ON DOING. THAT IS WHAT I DID WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT. THAT IS WHAT I WOULD DO IF I HAVE YOUR HONOR OF BEING , THAT IS WHAT WE WILL DO IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING YOUR PRESIDENT. WHAT WE CANNOT DO IS DIVIDE OURSELVES INTO PIECES. THAT IS THE ONLY STRATEGY THIS PRESIDENT SEEMS TO KNOW, BUT IT DOES NOT WORK. IT CAN DISTRACT YOU FROM A PROBLEM, IT CAN CREATE A NEW PROBLEM TO DIVIDE YOUR ATTENTION, BUT I CANNOT ACTUALLY SOLVE ANYTHING. YOU WILL KNOW BETTER THAN THAT. DIVIDING OURSELVES GETS US NOWHERE. WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER IN GOOD FAITH, COMPETENTLY, EFFICIENTLY. WE CAN DISAGREE ON POLICIES. WE HAVE TO COOPERATE. IT IS THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF THESE CRISES AND ENSURE THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE STILL AHEAD, WHICH I FIRMLY BELIEVE THEY ARE. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE, TRIED TO DO IN THIS CAMPAIGN. THAT IS WHERE I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT, WORK WITH ALL OF YOU, DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS. AS I SAID, IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL NOT BE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, I WILL BE AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT , BLUE STATES, RED STATES , IT DOES NOT MATTER TO ME. I PROMISE YOU, EVERY AMERICAN COMMUNITY DESERVES THE FULL SUPPORT OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. LOOK, BEING A MAYOR, AND I AM NOT KIDDING ABOUT THIS, IT IS HARD UNDER THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THE WORST THING A PRESIDENT CAN DO IS TO DRIVE WEDGES AND MAKE YOUR JOB TOUGHER BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT BENEFITS HIM OR STIRS UP CHAOS IN YOUR COMMUNITIES YOU DESERVE A PARTNER WHO WILL LISTEN TO YOU. WHO WILL WORK WITH YOU. WORK ON YOUR PRIORITIES. SOMEONE WHO GETS YOUR BACK AND SAVES BACK, WORKS TO COVER YOUR BACK, NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE AND NO MATTER WHAT CHALLENGE YOU ARE FACING. YOU KNOW, THIS MOMENT WE ARE FACING NOW IS NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT, IT IS AN AMERICAN MOMENT. IT SOUNDS CORNY, DOESN'T IT? BUT IT IS TRUE. IT IS AN AMERICAN MOMENT. IT IS TO OVERCOME ANGER AND DIVISION THAT HAS HELD US BACK FOR FAR TOO LONG. WE CAN EMERGE FROM THESE CRISES. WE CAN DO WHAT WE ARE BEST AT DOING , UNITE, WORK TOGETHER, AND IT STARTS WITH THE MAYORS. AND I REALLY MEAN THAT. IT STARTS WITH ALL OF YOU. I PROMISE YOU, IF I AM ELECTED, YOU WILL HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL, BECAUSE WE NEED YOU TO BUILD BACK AT BETTER. YOU ARE THE FOUNDATION STONE, NOT A JOKE. YOU ARE THE ONES LEADING THE WAY. AND WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS, OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS, MORE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO CITIES THAN OUT OF CITIES. THERE'S SO MUCH , SO MANY POSSIBILITIES. WE HAVE GOT TO STOP THE HATE AND DIVISION, THOUGH. WE HAVE GOT TO STOP POURING FLAMES ON THE FIRE. WE HAVE GOT TO SUPPORT THE STRENGTH OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL DO. YOU DO IT EVERYDAY. I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO YOU, I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC , AND I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME , ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF THIS COUNTRY THAN I AM TODAY. THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON NOW. THEY UNDERSTAND. THEY UNDERSTAND IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US. THEY WANT TO GET THINGS DONE, AND SO IT IS GOING TO START WITH YOU. I PROMISE I WILL HAVE YOUR BACK. LOOK AT MY RECORD. I HAVE. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR IDEAS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE FUNNELED UP. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A STATE LEGISLATURE OR GO THROUGH A GOVERNOR, YOU CAN GO STRAIGHT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, STRAIGHT TO ME. I REALLY MEAN IT. SO GOD BLESS YOU, MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS, AND THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO. YOUR JOB IS TOO HARD FOR ME. THANK YOU, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. IT IS AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU WITH US TODAY.

AN ENORMOUS MOUND OF WATER. WITH THAT MOUND OF WATER, THE WAVES CRASHING ON TOP OF IT THAT SLAMMED INTO GALVESTON. AND EVENTUALLY TURNED GALVESTON INTO A LAKE. JOE BIDEN SAYS IT IS UNFAIR PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MOVING FORWARD WITH JUDGE MERRICK'S NOMINATION AT A TIME WHEN EARLY VOTING IS UNDERWAY. HERE ARE HIS REEFER GOOD AFTERNOON. THE FIRST WOMAN, THE FIRST WOMAN IN HISTORY OF OUR NATION TO LIE IN STATE IN THE U.S. CAPITOL. AND THOUGH IT SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN NEARLY THIS LONG, TO BESTOW THAT HONOR ON A WOMAN, IT NONETHELESS SPEAKS OF THE IMPACT JUSTICE GINSBURG HAS MADE ON OUR SOCIETY AND HER ENDURING LEGACY OF EQUAL RIGHTS AND JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. SHORTLY BEFORE JUSTICE GINSBURG PASSED, SHE TOLD HER GRANDDAUGHTER , AND I QUOTE , \"MY MOST FERVENT WISH IS THAT I WILL NOT BE REPLACED UNTIL A NEW PRESIDENT IS INSTALLED. \" IT WAS NOT A PERSONAL REQUEST, IT WASN'T A FAVOR BEING ASKED FOR, IT WAS THE LAST ACT OF A LONG, UNFLINCHING CAREER OF STANDING UP FOR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. NEVER BEFORE IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY HAS A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BEEN NOMINATED AND INSTALLED WHILE A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS ALREADY UNDERWAY. IT DEFIES EVERY PRESIDENT, EVERY , EVERY PRECEDENT, EVERY EXPECTATION OF A NATION WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE SOVEREIGN AND THE RULE OF LAW REIGNS. BUT YESTERDAY, BEFORE JUSTICE GINSBURG COULD BE LAID TO REST AND AFTER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS HAD ALREADY CASTED , CAST THEIR BALLOTS, THE PRESIDENT NOMINATED A SUCCESSOR TO HER SEAT. THERE IS NO MYSTERY ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO THROW OUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO IT FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BEEN TRYING TO ELIMINATE IT FOR A DECADE. TWICE, THE SUPREME COURT HAS UPHELD THAT LAW, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND THE CONGRESS, EXPRESSING THE POPULAR WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, HAS REJECTED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EFFORTS AS WELL. NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THEY HAVE FOUND A LOOPHOLE IN THE TRAGEDY OF JUSTICE GINSBURG'S DEATH. IT DOESN'T MATTER TO THEM THAT THE REPUBLICANS SET A PRECEDENT JUST FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN THEY DENIED EVEN THE COURTESY OF A HEARING AFTER JUSTICE SCALIA PASSED AFTER HE PASSED AWAY NINE MONTHS PRIOR TO ELECTION DAY. IT DIDN'T MATTER TO THEM. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALREADY VOTING ON A NEW PRESIDENT AND A NEW CONGRESS HAD BEGUN. ALL THAT DOES MATTER IS THAT THEY SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO OVERTURN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON THEIR WAY OUT THE DOOR. AS I SPEAK, WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS IN A CENTURY, A CRISIS HAS TAKEN OVER 200,000 LIVES, BETWEEN 750 AND A THOUSAND LIVES A DAY AND COUNTING. AND YET, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING THE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW, AS I SPEAK, TO ELIMINATE THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THE ADMINISTRATION FILED A BRIEF IN THE SUPREME COURT THAT CONCLUDES, \"THE ENTIRE ACA THUS MUST FALL.\" THE ENTIRE ACA THUS MUST FALL. PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN CLAIM ALL HE WANTS THAT HE IS GOING TO PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, BUT THE FACT IS HE IS ALREADY FIGHTING TO TAKE THOSE PROTECTIONS AWAY AS WE SPEAK. IF HE HAS HIS WAY, MORE THAN ONE , THAN 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA, DIABETES, AND CANCER COULD ONCE AGAIN BE DENIED COVERAGE. COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID-19 LIKE LUNG SCARRING AND HEART DAMAGE COULD BECOME THE NEXT FLOOD OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS USED AS AN EXCUSE TO DENY COVERAGE TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WOMEN COULD ONCE AGAIN BE CHARGED HIGHER PREMIUMS JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN. PREGNANCY BECOMING A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AGAIN. SENIORS COULD SEE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES GO UP. AND THE FUNDING FOR MEDICARE GO DOWN. IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT, PRESIDENT TRUMP SEES A CHANCE TO FULFILL HIS EXPLICIT MISSION , STEAL AWAY THE VITAL PROTECTIONS OF THE ACA FROM COUNTLESS FAMILIES WHO HAVE COME TO RELY ON THEM FOR THEIR HEALTH, FINANCIAL SECURITY, AND THE LIVES OF THOSE THEY LOVE. PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST TWEETED AN HOUR AGO ON MY WAY HERE, AND I QUOTE, \"OBAMACARE WILL BE REPLACED WITH A MUCH BETTER AND FAR CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE. IF IT IS TERMINATED IN THE SUPREME COURT, IT WOULD BE A BIG WIN FOR THE USA.\" IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT ON SATURDAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD NOMINATE JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT, AND ON LAY SUNDAY OUT CLEARLY WHAT HIS OBJECTIVE IS, TO TERMINATE OBAMACARE. THE JUDGE HAS A WRITTEN TRACK RECORD OF DISAGREEING ADAMANTLY WITH THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISIONS, ON TWO OCCASIONS UPHOLDING THE ACA. IN FACT, NOT AS A JUDGE, BUT PRIOR TO GOING ON THE BENCH, SHE PUBLICLY CRITICIZED CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS' OPINION UPHOLDING THE LAW EIGHT YEARS AGO. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF THIS MOMENT. THEY ARE ALREADY VOTING IN DROVES BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR HEALTH CARE HANGS IN THE BALANCE. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IF DONALD TRUMP GETS HIS WAY, THEY COULD LOSE THEIR RIGHTS TO VOTE, THEY ARE RIGHT , THEIR RIGHT TO CLEAN AIR AND WATER, THEIR RIGHT TO EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, WORKERS COULD LOSE THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS, DREAMERS COULD BE THROWN OUT OF THE ONLY COUNTRY THEY HAVE EVER KNOWN, AND WOMEN COULD LOSE THE RIGHTS ENSHRINED IN ROE V. WADE FOR 50 YEARS. PEOPLE ARE VOTING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE VERY SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY IS AT STAKE AND BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT AFFECT THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES. THEIR VOICES MAY NOT MATTER TO DONALD TRUMP, THEY MAY NOT MATTER TO MITCH MCCONNELL, BUT THERE ARE SENATE REPUBLICANS WHO KNOW IN THEIR HEARTS THAT IF THEY SHUT OUT THE VOICES OF THOSE DURING A VOTING PERIOD, DURING AN ELECTION, CLOSING THE DOOR ON AMERICAN DEMOCRACY THEREAFTER. THIS IS WHERE THE POWER OF THE NATION RESIDES , IN THE PEOPLE, IN THE RULE OF LAW IN PRECEDENTS WE HAVE ABIDED BY. TO SUBVERT NEEDLESSLY, EVEN AS AMERICANS ARE CASTING THEIR VOTE WOULD BE A UNIVERSAL STEP TOWARDS THE BREAK AND A BETRAYAL IN THE EQUALITY AMERICA IS BUILT ON. THE PEOPLE DECIDE. SENATORS MUST NOT ACT ON THIS NOMINATION UNTIL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FINISH THE PROCESS THEY HAVE ALREADY BEGUN OF SELECTING THEIR PRESIDENT AND THEIR CONGRESS. AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, IF THE PEOPLE CHOOSE DONALD TRUMP, THEN THE SENATE SHOULD GIVE HIS NOMINEE A HEARING AND A VOTE. IF THE PEOPLE DO NOT CHOOSE TRUMP AND CHOOSE ME, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINATION SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN, I SHOULD NOMINATE, CHOSEN BY A PRESIDENT WHO HAS JUST BEEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, TO GET A FAIR HEARING, WHICH WOULD NOT EVEN OCCUR UNTIL EARLY FEBRUARY. A CONFIRMATION VOTE. THE U.S. CONSTITUTION PROVIDES ONE CHANCE , 1 , THE AMERICANS FOUR TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD ON WHO SERVES A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT ON THE SUPREME COURT. WHO MAKES THOSE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CARE, THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS, AND MUCH ELSE. THAT CHANCE IS NOW. THAT MOMENT IS NOW. THE VOTERS IN MY VIEW ARE NOT GOING TO STAND FOR THIS ABUSE OF POWER. AND FOR US TO CALL OURSELVES A DEMOCRACY, THEIR VOICES MUST BE HEARD. I URGE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO KEEP VOTING, TO LET YOUR CURRENT SENATORS KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO BE HEARD BEFORE A VOTE ON CONFIRMATION OF A NEW JUSTICE. AND I URGE EVERY SENATOR TO TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THE BRINK, TAKE OFF THE BLINDERS OF POLITICS FOR JUST ONE CRITICAL MOMENT AND STAND UP FOR THE CONSTITUTION YOU SWORE TO UPHOLD. THIS IS A TIME TO DE-ESCALATE, TO PUT AN END TO THE SHATTERING OF PRECEDENTS THAT HAS THROWN OUR NATION INTO CHAOS UNDER THIS PRESIDENT. JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE POWER TO DO SOMETHING DOES NOT ABSOLVE YOU OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO RIGHT BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. UPHOLD YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY, SOMEONE YOUR , SUMMON YOUR CONSCIENCE, STAND UP FOR THE PEOPLE, STAND UP FOR OUR SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. AMERICANS ARE WATCHING, AMERICANS ARE VOTING, AND WE MUST LISTEN TO THEM NOW. WE MUST ALLOW THEM TO EXERCISE THIS SACRED POWER. SO PLEASE LISTEN. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA, MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS, AND I WILL TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS. THEY SHOULD SEE TO IT THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WILL VOTE ON THE SENATE RACES THIS ELECTION AND THEY WILL VOTE REPUBLICANS OUT OF OFFICE. THAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE. THAT IS THE FOCUS. THAT IS WHY I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR AND STAY ON MESSAGE. THE CLEAR FOCUS IS THIS IS ABOUT YOUR HEALTH CARE. THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE ACA WILL EXIST. THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE COVERED. THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT A WOMAN CAN BE CHARGED MORE FOR THE SAME PROCEDURE AS A MAN. THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE'S HEALTH CARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. YES? YOU ASKED ME ONE QUESTION, FIRE AWAY. NO, I HAVE NOT. I CONCLUDED THAT THAT WOULD PUT THEM IN A POSITION, IF THEY WERE TO VOTE THE RIGHT WAY, THEY WOULD BE COMPROMISED. I HAVE RESPECT FOR A NUMBER OF MY FORMER REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES AND I AM HOPING THEY WILL DO THE RIGHT THING. I AM NOT , I KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO BE UPSET WITH MY ANSWER. BUT WHAT I'M NOT GOING TO DO IS PLAY THE TRUMP GAME, WHICH IS A GOOD GAME HE PLAYS. TAKE YOUR EYE OFF THE ISSUE BEFORE US. IF I WERE TO SAY YES OR NO TO THAT, THAT BECOMES A BIG ISSUE. THAT IS THE HEADLINE. I AM FOCUSED ON ONE THING RIGHT NOW, AND I REALLY MEAN IT. I'M FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE BEING CUT OUT OF THIS PROCESS THEY ARE ENTITLED TO BE PART OF, AND CUT OUT OF THE DESIGN IN ORDER TO TAKE AWAY THE ACA AND YOUR HEALTH CARE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC. THAT IS THE FOCUS, THAT IS WHAT IT IS, THAT IS THE DEAL. THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR ME, I'M SORRY.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?476319-1\/joe-biden-remarks-president-trumps-supreme-court-nomination","Summary":"2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered brief remarks in Wilmington, Deleware, on President Trump&rsquo;s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.

LIVE COVERAGE ON C-SPAN AND C-SPAN.ORG. LISTEN LIVE ON THE C-SPAN RADIO APP AND BE SURE TO VISIT C-SPAN.ORG TO REVIEW A PLAYLIST OF AMY CONEY BARRETT'S LEGAL VIEWS. HEY, FOLKS. GOOD AFTERNOON. BEFORE I START, I WANTED TO SLAIN THE DELAY. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE WERE DOING EVERYTHING BY THE NUMBERS. WE HAD TO COVID TESTS THIS MORNING. EVERYTHING IS CLEAR. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR BEFORE I CAME. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN EVENT AFTER THIS AT A HEADQUARTERS. BUT BASED ON THE CROWD SIZE AND INDOORS, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS BEST NOT TO DO IT. BUT I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU. I WANT TO THANK MATT. MATT, YOU ARE DEAD RIGHT. YOU WERE PUTTING YOURSELF ON THE LINE. AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE DID ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. I WANT TO THANK THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY OF LOCAL 951 FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. LOOK, LET'S START , I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACKNOWLEDGING, WHICH I'M SURE ALL OF YOU DO AS WELL, SENDING MY PRAYERS FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE FIRST LADY AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AFTER THEY TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID-19. MY WIFE, JILL, AND I PRAY THEY MAKE A QUICK AND FULL RECOVERY. THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF POLITICS. IT'S A BRACING REMINDER TO ALL OF US THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS VIRUS SERIOUSLY. IT'S NOT GOING AWAY AUTOMATICALLY. WE HAVE TO DO OUR PART TO BE RESPONSIBLE. IT MEANS FOLLOWING THE SCIENCE, LISTENING TO THE EXPERTS, WASHING OUR HANDS, SOCIAL DISTANCING. IT MEANS WEARING A MASK IN PUBLIC AND IT MEANS ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO DO SO AS WELL. IT MEANS HAVING MASKING MANDATES NATIONWIDE. THE DIRECTOR OF THE C.D.C., CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL, DR. REDFIELD SAID, AND I QUOTE, HE HELD UP A MASK, HE SAID, \"THESE FACEMASKS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT POWERFUL PUBLIC HEALTH TOOL WE HAVE.\" THEN HE HELD THE MASK UP AGAIN AND SAID, \"THIS FACE MASK IS MORE GUARANTEED TO PROTECT ME AGAINST COVID THAN A VACCINE.\" END OF QUOTE. LEADING SCIENTISTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON TELL US THAT WE CAN SAVE MORE THAN 100,000 AMERICAN LIVES IN THE NEXT 100 DAYS ALONE IF EVERYONE WORE A MASK IN PUBLIC. SO LET ME REPEAT THAT, BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT. WE CAN SAVE 100,000 LIVES IN THE NEXT 100 DAYS, ACCORDING TO THE HEAD OF THE C.D.C., IF EVERYONE WEARS A MASK IN PUBLIC. SO, BE PATRIOTIC. IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING A TOUGH GUY. IT'S ABOUT DOING YOUR PART. WEARING A MASK IS NOT ONLY GOING TO PROTECT YOU, BUT ALSO PROTECTS THOSE AROUND YOU. YOUR MOM, YOUR DAD, YOUR BROTHER, YOUR SISTER, HUSBAND, WIFE, NEIGHBOR, CO-WORKER. DON'T JUST DO IT FOR YOURSELF. DO IT FOR THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH. THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS VIRUS ALSO UNDERSCORES THAT WE NEED REGULAR TESTING WITH RESULTS TURNED AROUND RAPIDLY AND THAT'S AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. IT'S NOT JUST THE FOLKS IN THE WHITE HOUSE OR WHO TRAVEL WITH ME THAT DESERVE REGULAR TESTING. IT'S FOLKS IN THE MEAT PACKING AND FOOD PROCESSING PLANTS, GROCERY STORE WORKERS, EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN DESERVES SAFETY AND PEACE OF MIND. AND IT MEANS WE NEED TRANSPARENCY. THOSE WHO TEST POSITIVE NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN CONTACT TRACING SO THAT EVERYONE WHO THEY MAY HAVE EXPOSED CAN GET TESTED THEMSELVES. THAT'S HOW YOU STOP TRANSMISSION FOR ANY EPIDEMIC. IT'S BASIC. WE NEED TO TAKE THE SCIENCE OF FIGHTING THIS DISEASE SERIOUSLY IF WE'RE GOING TO SAVE LIVES. AND ABOVE ALL, THE NEWS IS A REMINDER THAT WE AS A NATION NEED TO DO BETTER IN DEALING WITH THIS PANDEMIC. TAKING THESE STEPS IS HOW WE'LL PROTECT OURSELVES. AND JUST AS IMPORTANT, IS HOW WE WILL PROTECT ONE ANOTHER. I HOPE YOU ALL , THOSE WHO ARE FIGHTING THIS VIRUS, INCLUDING THE FIRST FAMILY, AND SO MANY AMERICANS TODAY RECOVER AND RECOVER SOON. OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH THE FAMILIES OF THE MORE THAN 207,000 AMERICANS WHO HAVE DIED FROM THIS VIRUS. MANY OF THEM GOT UP THIS MORNING, THE BREAKFAST TABLE, THERE WAS AN EMPTY CHAIR OF SOMEONE THEY LOST AND THEY LOVED. WE UNDERSTAND. AND THERE'S MORE THAN 7 MILLION AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW INFECTED, HAVE BEEN INFECTED. THAT INCLUDES FOLKS HERE IN GRAND RAPIDS AND ALL ACROSS MICHIGAN. ESPECIALLY ALL OF YOU WITH UFCW WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS PANDEMIC AND ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS. THE UFCW WORKERS WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF FIGHTING FOR DIGNITY AND RESPECT YOU DESERVE. I KNOW IT'S BEEN TOUGH. THIS MORNING, THE SEPTEMBER JOBS REPORT CAME OUT. THE LAST ONE BEFORE ELECTION DAY. I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE ABLE TO GET THEIR JOBS BACK, TO WORK AGAIN. BUT THERE'S FEWER JOBS THAN WE'D HOPED FOR, AND MILLIONS OF FAMILIES, MILLIONS ARE STILL WONDERING WHEN IT WILL BE THEIR TURN TO COME BACK FROM THE BRINK. AND THE SIGNS, ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL PRESS, ARE NOT ENCOURAGING. ONCE AGAIN, THE PACE OF JOB GAINS IS SLOWING DOWN. ONCE AGAIN, WE'RE SEEING TEMPORARY LAYOFFS TURN PERMANENT. THIS MONTH MARKED THE LARGEST SINGLE MONTH INCREASE IN LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT SINCE WE STARTED KEEPING RECORDS IN 1948. THERE ARE NOW AN ADDITIONAL 781,000 AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND WORK FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS. THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR WORK FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS AND HAVEN'T FOUND IT. AND IN THE PAST, THAT'S A SIGN FOR PERMANENCY FOR THEM. WE'RE STILL DOWN 647,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS NATIONWIDE SINCE THE CRISIS STARTED. ALL TOLD, WE ARE NOW 30 MILLION WORKERS WHO HAVE EITHER LOST HOURS, LOST PAYCHECKS, OR LOST THEIR JOBS ENTIRELY. PARTICIPATION IN THE LABOR FORCE FELL LAST MONTH AND REMAINS SHARPLY DOWN SINCE THIS CRISIS BEGAN, ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN. THERE'S ANOTHER ROUGHLY 700,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE DROPPED OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE, STOPPED LOOKING FOR A JOB. THE VAST MAJORITY WERE WOMEN, DEMONSTRATING ONCE AGAIN HOW THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY TOUGH ON WOMEN AND FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENCY IN MODERN HISTORY TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS THAN WHEN IT CAME INTO OFFICE. MICHIGAN HAS LOST MORE THAN 361,000 JOBS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2017. IN FACT, FACTORIES WERE ALREADY CLOSING BEFORE COVID, LIKE THE PLANT HERE IN GRAND RAPIDS. THEY ANNOUNCED BACK IN JANUARY THEY WERE SHUTTING DOWN AND CUTTING 210 LOCAL JOBS. MANUFACTURING ALREADY SLIPPED INTO A RECESSION LAST YEAR. THE NET LOSS OF AUTO MANUFACTURING JOBS YOU SAW HERE IN MICHIGAN. AND THAT ECONOMIC PAIN WAS ONLY AMPLIFIED BY THE PANDEMIC. YOUR SCHOOLS AND LOCAL BUSINESSES ARE CLOSED, LIKE ALL PLACES AROUND AMERICA. MORE THAN 26 MILLION UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS WERE FILED BY AMERICANS LAST MONTH. 46 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR EMERGENCY SAVINGS, AND ESSENTIAL WORKERS HERE IN GRAND RAPIDS WON'T FORGET HOW THE UFCW MEMBERS SAW THEIR JOBS TURNED SUDDENLY INTO A LIFE AND DEATH TASK. FOLKS, TODAY, TODAY'S REPORT REINFORCES ANOTHER PAINFUL TREND. THE CONTINUING OF WHAT ECONOMISTS CALL A K-SHAPED RECOVERY. THE K MEANS, THAT LETTER GOING UP, THAT'S THOSE ON THE TOP THAT KEEPS GOING UP. WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IN THE MIDDLE IS GOING DOWN AND BELOW. WE'RE SEEING THINGS GET WORSE. IT MEANS ESSENTIAL WORKERS, UFCW WORKERS, WHO SACRIFICED TO KEEP US GOING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC, AND CONTINUE IT, ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND BY THE MOST UNEQUAL RECOVERY IN MODERN HISTORY. BECAUSE WHILE WORKERS ARE STRUGGLING, THIS IS A FACT, THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA HAVE DONE PRETTY WELL. JUST THE TOP 100 OF THEM. THEY'VE MADE UP MORE THAN $30 BILLION THIS YEAR, IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS. AND EVERYONE ELSE, THOUGH YOU KEEP HOPING, YOU GET THE BOTTOM OF THAT K-SHAPED RECOVERY. YOU GET THE DOWNWARD SLIDE. YOU'RE LEFT TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PAY THE BILL AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE, HOW TO BALANCE DOING YOUR JOB WITH BEING A TEACHER TO YOUR KIDS BECAUSE THEIR SCHOOL HAS GONE REMOTE. YOU'RE ASKED TO RISK YOUR NECK BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WORK FROM HOME FOR THE RISKS OF COVID ARE KEPT OUTSIDE. BECAUSE YOU WORK AT A MEAT PACKING PLANT OR AN ASSEMBLY LINE OR AT A CHECKOUT COUNTER. YOU KNOW, I DO UNDERSTAND THIS IS A SCARY TIME AND UNCERTAIN TIME. I UNDERSTAND AND I SEE YOU. BECAUSE I SEE THE WORLD FROM WHERE I GREW UP IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. A LOT LIKE GRAND RAPIDS. IT IS FULL OF AN AWFUL LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE BUSTING THEIR NECK EVERY DAY TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THEIR FAMILIES. IN SCRANTON, MY MOM USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. SHE SAID, NOT JUST IN SCRANTON, BUT FROM THE TIME SHE LEFT THERE, SHE SAID, JOEY, NOBODY'S BETTER THAN YOU, JOEY. BUT EVERYBODY'S YOUR EQUAL. MY DAD'S CONSTANT REFRAIN AFTER HE LOST HIS JOB IN SCRANTON, WHEN THERE WERE NO MORE WORK AND WE HAD TO MOVE TO DELAWARE, HE MOVED AWAY FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR, COME BACK EVERY WEEKEND TO SEE US. BY THE TIME WE FINALLY A COUPLE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD IN DELAWARE GOT TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO BUY A HOME, MY DAD USED TO USE THIS EXPRESSION. HE SAID, JOEY, A JOB'S ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. THESE ARE THE VALUES THAT SHAPED MY GROWING UP, AND I SUSPECT MOST OF YOU. THEY SHAPED MY WHOLE LIFE. SO I KNOW AND UNDERSTOOD FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT THIS THAT WALL STREET AND C.E.O.'S DIDN'T BUILD THIS COUNTRY. THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY, AND UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. THAT'S WHY I'VE LAID OUT A COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA NOT JUST TO REBUILD OUR COMMUNITIES, BUT TO MAKE BOLD INVESTMENTS SO WE CAN BUILD BACK AND BUILD BACK BETTER. AND AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS FROM WALL STREET, MOODY'S, PROJECTED THAT MY PLAN WILL CREATE 18.6 MILLION JOBS, 7 MILLION MORE THAN THE ADMINISTRATION'S ECONOMIC PLAN, AND $1 TRILLION MORE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. THAT'S NOT COMING FROM A LIBERAL THINK TANK. THAT'S COMING FROM MOODY'S. HERE'S HOW MY PLAN WORKS. I'M GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON PEOPLE ONLY MAKING OVER $400,000. ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR WON'T PAY A PENNY MORE. I'M GOING TO ASK THE VERY BIG CORPORATIONS, THE FORTUNE 500 AND THE WEALTHY, TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE FOR A CHANGE. THAT MEANS RAISING THE CORPORATE TAX RATE, WHICH WAS IN THE MID 30%'S AND IS NOW AT 20% BACK TO 28%. THAT MEANS MAKING SURE THAT NO BIG COMPANY GETS AWAY WITH PAYING ZERO TAXES, AS 91 FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES DO TODAY. MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ZERO TAXES. HOW MANY OF YOU PAID ZERO TAXES? IT MEANS MAKING SURE THAT THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS DON'T GET TO PAY THE LOWER TAX RATE BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING MONEY ON THEIR INVESTMENTS, BUT THEY PAY AT THE SAME RATE THAT THEY PAY FOR THEIR SALARY. THESE CHANGES IN THE TAX CODE WILL RAISE THE MONEY THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE AND GROWING THE MIDDLE CLASS, WHICH WHEN I ANNOUNCED I WAS RUNNING, I SAID THAT'S THE REASON, TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. HARDWORKING FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD-PAYING JOBS, UNION JOBS. AND THIS IS, BY THE WAY, MY PLAN HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY ANALYZED BY A WHOLE BUNCH OF FOLKS. TAKE INFRASTRUCTURE. BUILDING ROADS, BRIDGES, HIGHWAYS, PORTS, AIRPORTS WILL PUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO WORK IN GOOD-PAYING UNION JOBS AND CREATE THE FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH IN THIS COUNTRY. CLEAN ENERGY, JUST UPGRADING 4 MILLION BUILDINGS AND WEATHERIZING TWO MILLION HOMES WILL CREATE AT LEAST ONE MILLION GOOD-PAYING JOBS. LEADING THE WORLD ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND BUILDING 500,000 ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS ON THE HIGHWAYS WILL CREATE 1 MILLION NEW AUTO JOBS HERE IN THIS STATE. THE MANUFACTURING AND TECHNOLOGY IN THOSE AREAS, MAKING SURE, MAKING SURE THAT FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA, MADE IN MICHIGAN, WITH GOOD UNION JOBS. YOU KNOW, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDS $600 BILLION A YEAR, OF YOUR TAX DOLLARS, TO PURCHASE EVERYTHING FROM MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO STEEL TO CARS TO TRUCKS TO FEDERAL FLEETS. THAT'S $600 BILLION. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE WE FINALLY MAKE GOOD ON THE COMMITMENT MADE A LONG TIME AGO THAT THESE PRODUCTS, ALL THESE CONTRACTS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN AWARD, MAKE SURE THOSE PRODUCTS WERE MADE BY AMERICANS IN AMERICA. MAKING SURE THAT THAT'S DONE. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT WILL CREATE 5 MILLION NEW MANUFACTURING JOBS AND TECHNOLOGY JOBS. FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE SMALL BUSINESSES COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE, WITH ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND THE ABILITY TO DEAL WITH THE DEBTS THAT HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATED DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AND WE'LL MAKE INVESTMENTS TO INCREASE INCOMES AS WELL. $15 MINIMUM WAGE. NO ONE, NO ONE SHOULD BE IN THE POSITION TO HAVE TO WORK TWO JOBS JUST TO GET ABOVE THE POVERTY LINE. WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK JOBS TO AMERICA FROM OVERSEAS. AND DIRECT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REVITALIZATION FUNDS AND COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO HELP COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE IN WESTERN MICHIGAN COMPETE FOR NEW BUSINESS STARTUPS. FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS, WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO PRAISE YOU. WE'RE GOING TO PAY YOU A GOOD WAGE, TO ENSURE YOU HAVE A STRONG BENEFIT. WE'RE GOING TO EASE THE BURDEN OF THE MAJOR COST IN YOUR LIFE, HEALTH CARE. WE'LL BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THROUGH A NEW HEALTH INSURANCE OPTION. A NOT-FOR-PROFIT PUBLIC OPTION WHICH WILL GIVE PRIVATE INSURERS A REAL COMPETITOR. WE'LL INCREASE SUBSIDIES FOR YOUR PREMIUMS SO THEY'RE LOWER, SO YOU CAN AFFORD THE PLANS WITH LOWER DEDUCTIONS AND LOWER OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES. IT WILL COST , THAT PLAN ALONE WILL COST OVER $700 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. BUT IT'S PAID FOR BY ELIMINATING THOSE TAX CUTS. FOR A 40-YEAR-OLD MAKING $50,000 A YEAR, YOUR MONTHLY PREMIUM WILL GO DOWN BY ONE-THIRD. WE'LL TAKE ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WITH A PLAN THAT SLASHES THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UP TO 60%. MEDICARE WILL BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE PRICES FOR DRUGS. FUNDAMENTALLY LOWERING THOSE PRICES. AND CHILD CARE, A LOT OF YOU ARE DEALING WITH THAT NOW. HOW DO YOU GO TO WORK IF YOU HAVE WORK AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR KIDS, OR AN AGING RELATIVE THAT'S IN TROUBLE? WE'RE GOING TO MAKE HIGH-QUALITY CHILD CARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. EVERY 3-YEAR-OLD AND 4-YEAR-OLD WILL HAVE ACCESS TO FREE QUALITY PRESCHOOL. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WILL NEVER HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME FOR CARING FOR A YOUNG CHILD. AND EDUCATION BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE TUITIONS OF A STATE UNIVERSITY IS TUITION-FREE FOR ANY FAMILY MAKING LESS THAN $125,000. COMMUNITY COLLEGE WILL BE FREE AND PROGRAMS FOR TRAINING WILL BE FREE AS WELL. IF YOU BUY YOUR FIRST HOME, YOU'LL HAVE A $15,000 HELP TO GET THERE. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A WHILE. WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY, INCREASE THE BENEFITS FOR MILLIONS OF SENIORS. THE PRESIDENT'S TALKING ABOUT GIVING , ELIMINATING THE WITHHOLDING TAX. WELL, THAT'S WONDERFUL, EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. THE ACTUARY OF SOCIAL SECURITY SAID IF THAT PLAN GOES THROUGH, SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE BANKRUPT BY 2023. FOLKS, I PROMISE YOU, WE CAN DO THIS. LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING THIS. I KNOW, I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND HERE ARE TIRED OF FEELING OVERLOOKED AND DISRESPECTED. I GET THAT. THE PEOPLE I MET THIS WEEK TAKING A TRAIN THROUGH NORTHEASTERN OHIO AND WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA, PEOPLE LIKE THE DEDICATED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER FROM LORDSTOWN, OHIO, WHOSE HUSBAND, WHEN LORDSTOWN SHUT DOWN, ACCEPTED A TRANSFER, KENTUCKY, EIGHT HOURS AWAY. EACH DIRECTION. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO KEEP HIS HEALTH CARE AND HIS PENSION AFTER THE G.M. PLANT CLOSED. FOLKS WHO WORRY ABOUT HEALTH CARE, WILL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT STILL BE THERE FOR THEM? WHY, WHY, THEY ASK, WILL I BE THE 100 MILLION AMERICANS WHO COULD LOSE THE PROTECTION FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA AND DIABETES? WHERE ONCE AGAIN WOMEN WILL BE ABLE TO BE CHARGED A HIGHER PREMIUM SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE A WOMAN? WHERE INSURERS NO LONGER HAVE TO ALLOW YOU TO BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR KIDS ON A HEALTH CARE PLAN UNTIL AGE 26? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR MEDICARE BENEFITS, YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY? WILL THEY STILL BE THERE WHEN YOU RETIRE? I AM ASKED MANY TIMES IN RECENT YEARS, HOW DO WE GET TO THE PLACE WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO STOCK OUR SHELVES, PACK OUR FOOD, TEACH OUR KIDS, LIKE MY FAMILY, TAKE CARE OF MY WIFE, TAKE CARE OF OUR SICK, WHO RACE INTO BURNING BUILDINGS AND PICK UP THE GARBAGE OFF OUR STREETS, WHO DID, HOW DID WE GET TO THE PLACE WHERE Y'ALL DON'T THINK WE SEE YOU ANYMORE? OR HEAR THEM? AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, RESPECT THEM? THAT HAS TO CHANGE. I KNOW IT CAN. I COME FROM THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. WE CAN GET THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL SO WE CAN GET OUR ECONOMY WORKING AGAIN FOR EVERYONE. BUT THIS CANNOT BE A PARTISAN MOMENT. IT MUST BE AN AMERICAN MOMENT. WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AS A NATION. I'M RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT. BUT I AM , WILL RUN AND GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR ME OR AGAINST ME, I WILL REPRESENT YOU. AND THOSE WHO SEE EACH OTHER AS FELLOW AMERICANS WHO JUST DON'T LIVE IN RED STATES OR BLUE STATES, BUT WHO LIVE IN AND LOVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THAT'S WHO WE ARE.

WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IT MORE IN OUR 9:00 HOUR THIS MORNING ON \"THE WASHINGTON JOURNAL\" BUT A STORY ABOUT IT TODAY, NEW SAFETY MEASURES BEING PUT IN PLACE , THANK YOU. ROCK 'N' ROLL. OK. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE ON THIS GORGEOUS DAY AND A MAGNIFICENT, MAGNIFICENT SETTING. I THINK ABOUT ALL THE LIVES THAT WERE LOST HERE. PLEASE, ALL, HAVE A SEAT. ON JULY 4, 1863, AMERICA WORKED WITH THE REMAINS OF PERHAPS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL BATTLE ON AMERICAN SOIL. IT TOOK PLACE ON THIS GROUND AT GETTYSBURG. THREE DAYS OF VIOLENCE, THREE DAYS OF CARNAGE, 50,000 CASUALTIES WOUNDED, CAPTURED, MISSING, OR DEAD OVER THREE DAYS OF FIGHTING. WHEN THE SUN ROSE ON THAT INDEPENDENCE DAY, WE WOULD RETREAT. THE WAR WOULD GO ON FOR NEARLY TWO MORE YEARS. THE BACK OF THE CONFEDERACY HAD BEEN BROKEN. THE UNION WOULD BE SAVED. SLAVERY WOULD BE ABOLISHED. THE GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND OR THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT PERISH FROM THE EARTH , AND FOR THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT PERISH FROM THE EARTH AND FREEDOM WOULD BE BORN ANEW IN OUR LAND. THERE'S NO MORE FITTING PLACE THAN HERE TODAY IN GETTYSBURG TO TALK ABOUT THE COST OF DIVISION, HOW MUCH IT HAS COST AMERICA IN THE PAST, HOW MUCH IT IS COSTING US NOW AND WHY I BELIEVE IN THIS MOMENT WE MUST COME TOGETHER AS A NATION. FOR PRESIDENT LINCOLN, THE CIVIL WAR WAS ABOUT THE GREATEST OF CAUSES , THE END OF SLAVERY, WIDENING EQUALITY, PURSUIT OF JUSTICE, THE CREATION OF OPPORTUNITY, AND THE SANCTITY OF FREEDOM. HIS WORDS WOULD LIVE EVER AFTER. WE HEAR THEM IN OUR HEADS. WE KNOW THEM IN OUR HEARTS. WE DRAW ON THEM. WE SEEK HOPE IN HOURS OF DARKNESS. FOURSCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO, OUR FATHERS WOKE FORTH ON THIS CONTINENT A NEW NATION CONCEIVED IN LIBERTY AND DEDICATED TO THE PROPOSITION THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. HERE ON THIS SACRED GROUND, ABRAHAM LINCOLN REIMAGINED AMERICA ITSELF. HERE, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SPOKE OF THE PRICE OF DIVISION AND THE MEANING OF SACRIFICE. HE BELIEVED IN THE RESCUE, REDEMPTION, AND REDEDICATION OF THE UNION. ALL THIS AT A TIME NOT JUST OF FEROCIOUS DIVISION BUT OF WIDESPREAD DEATH, STRUCTURAL INIQUITY, AND FEAR OF THE FUTURE . AND HE TAUGHT US THIS , A HOUSE DIVIDED COULD NOT STAND. THAT IS A GREAT AND TIMELESS TRUTH. TODAY, ONCE AGAIN, WE ARE A HOUSE DIVIDED. THAT, MY FRIENDS, CAN NO LONGER BE. WE ARE FACING TOO MANY CRISES. WE HAVE TOO MUCH WORK TO DO. WE HAVE TWO BRIGHT A FUTURE TO HAVE A SHIPWRECK ON THE SHOALS OF ANGER AND HATE AND DIVISION. AS WE STAND HERE TODAY A CENTURY AND A HALF LATER AFTER GETTYSBURG, WE SHOULD CONSIDER AGAIN WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN EQUAL JUSTICE IS DENIED, WHEN ANGER AND VIOLENCE AND DIVISION ARE LEFT UNCHECKED. AS I LOOK ACROSS AMERICA TODAY, I'M CONCERNED THE COUNTRY IS IN A DANGEROUS PLACE. OUR TRUST IN EACH OTHER IS EBBING. HOPE REMAINS ELUSIVE. TOO MANY AMERICANS SEE OUR PUBLIC LIFE NOT AS AN ARENA FOR MEDIATION OF OUR DIFFERENCES BUT AN OCCASION FOR TOTAL, UNRELENTING PARTISAN WARFARE. INSTEAD OF TREATING EACH OTHER'S PARTIES AS THE OPPOSITION, WE TREAT THEM AS THE ENEMY. THIS MUST AND , THIS MUST END. WE NEED TO REVIVE THE SPIRIT OF BIPARTISANSHIP, THE SPIRIT OF BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER. WHEN I SAY THAT, AND I'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR TWO YEARS, I'VE BEEN TOLD I'M NAIVE. I'M TOLD THAT'S THE WAY THINGS USED TO WORK, BUT THEY CANNOT WORK THAT WAY ANYMORE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THEY CAN AND MUST IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE. I'M RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. THAT'S THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT , THE DUTY TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. REFUSAL OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO COOPERATE WITH ONE ANOTHER IS NOT DUE TO SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IT'S A DECISION. IT'S A CHOICE WE MAKE. IF WE DECIDE NOT TO COOPERATE, WE CAN DECIDE TO COOPERATE AS WELL. [APPLAUSE] BUT THERE IS SOMETHING BIGGER GOING ON IN THIS NATION THEN JUST OUR BROKEN POLITICS. SOMETHING DARKER, SOMETHING MORE DANGEROUS, AND ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT ORDINARY DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, COMPETING VIEWPOINTS GIVE LIFE AND VIBRANCY TO OUR DEMOCRACY. NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT, SOMETHING DEEPER. TOO MANY AMERICANS SEEK NOT TO OVERCOME OUR DIVISIONS BUT TO DEEPEN THE. WE MUST SEEK NOT TO BUILD WALLS BUT BRIDGES. WE MUST SEEK NOT TO HAVE OUR FIST CLENCHED PUT OUR ARMS OPEN. WE HAVE TO SEEK NOT TO TEAR EACH OTHER APART BUT SEEK TO COME TOGETHER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH ME ON EVERYTHING OR EVEN ON MOST THINGS. THE SCENE THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING TODAY IS NEITHER GOOD NOR NORMAL. I MADE THE DECISION TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AFTER CHARLOTTESVILLE. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAW , NEO-NAZIS, WHITE SUPREMACISTS, AND THE KKK COMING OUT OF THE FIELD WITH TORCHES LIGHTED, VEINS BULGING, CHANTING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BILE HEARD ACROSS EUROPE IN THE 1930'S. IT WAS HATE OUT IN THE OPEN IN AMERICA. HATE NEVER GOES AWAY. IT ONLY HIDES. WHEN IT'S GIVEN OXYGEN, WHEN IT'S GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPREAD, WHEN IT'S TREATED AS NORMAL AND ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR, WE HAVE OPENED A DOOR IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WE MUST MOVE QUICKLY TO CLOSE. AS PRESIDENT, THAT'S JUST WHAT I WILL DO. I WILL SEND A CLEAR, UNEQUIVOCAL MESSAGE TO THE ENTIRE NATION , THERE IS NO PLACE FOR HATE IN AMERICA. IT WILL BE GIVEN NO LICENSE. IT WILL BE GIVEN NO OXYGEN. IT WILL BE GIVEN NO SAFE HARBOR. IN RECENT WEEKS AND MONTHS, THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN RILED BY INSTANCES OF EXCESSIVE POLICE FORCE, HEART-WRENCHING CASES OF RACIAL INJUSTICE. MY , PEACEFUL PROTESTERS BEING GIVEN VOICE IN CALLS FOR JUSTICE . VIOLENT EXAMPLES OF LOOTING AND BURNING THAT CANNOT BE TOLERATED. I BELIEVE IN LAW AND ORDER. I'VE NEVER SUPPORTED DEFUNDING THE POLICE, BUT I ALSO BELIEVE INJUSTICE IS REAL AND IS THE PRODUCT OF A HISTORY THAT GOES BACK 400 YEARS WHEN BLACK, , WHEN BLACK MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN WERE FIRST BROUGHT HERE IN CHANGE. I DO NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN LAW AND ORDER AND RACIAL JUSTICE IN AMERICA. WE CAN HAVE BOTH. THIS IS A NATION STRONG ENOUGH TO BOTH HONESTLY FACE SYSTEMIC RACISM AND STRONG ENOUGH TO PROVIDE SAFE STREETS FOR FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT TOO OFTEN BEAR THE BRUNT OF THIS LOOTING AND BURNING. WE HAVE NO NEED FOR ARMED MILITIAS ROAMING AMERICAN STREETS, AND WE SHOULD HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR EXTREMIST WHITE SUPREMACY GROUPS MENACING OUR COMMUNITIES. IF YOU SAY WE SHOULD TRUST AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES TO DO THE JOB, AS I DO, THEN LET THEM DO THEIR JOB WITHOUT EXTREMIST GROUPS ACTING AS VIGILANTES. YOU SAY WE HAVE NO NEED TO FACE RACIAL INJUSTICE IN THE COUNTRY, YOU HAVE NOT OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE TRUTH IN AMERICA. THERE HAVE BEEN POWERFUL VOICES FOR JUSTICE IN RECENT WEEKS AND MONTHS. GEORGE FLOYD'S SIX-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, WHOM I MET WITH, WHO LOOKED AT ME AND SAID IN HER SMALL CHILD VOICE, \"DADDY CHANGED THE WORLD.\" JACOB LIKE , JACOB BLAKE'S MOTHER IS ANOTHER WHO SAID VIOLENCE DOES NOT REFLECT HER SON AND THIS NATION NEEDS HEALING. DOC RIVERS, THE BASKETBALL COACH, CHOKING BACK TEARS WHEN HE SAID, \"WE ARE THE ONES GETTING KILLED. WE ARE THE ONES GETTING SHOT. WE'VE BEEN HUNG. IT'S AMAZING WHY WE KEEP LOVING THIS COUNTRY AND THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT LOVE US BACK.\" I THINK ABOUT THAT. I THINK ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES FOR A BLACK PERSON TO LOVE AMERICA. THAT IS A DEEP LOVE OF COUNTRY THAT HAS FOR FAR TOO LONG NEVER BEEN RECOGNIZED. WE NEED AN AMERICAN LEADERSHIP THAT SEEKS TO DE-ESCALATE TENSIONS, TO OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION, TO BRING US TOGETHER, TO HEAL, TO HOPE. AS PRESIDENT, THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT I WILL DO. WE PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR ALLOWING THE DEEP DIVISION IN THIS COUNTRY TO IMPACT HOW WE DEAL WITH THE CORONAVIRUS. 210,000 AMERICANS DEAD, AND THE NUMBER IS CLIMBING. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT NEARLY ANOTHER 210 THOUSAND AMERICANS COULD LOSE THEIR LIVES BY THE END OF THE YEAR. ENOUGH. NO MORE. LET'S JUST SET PARTISANSHIP ASIDE. LET'S END THE POLITICS AND FOLLOW THE SCIENCE. WEARING A MASK IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT. IT'S A SCIENTIFIC RECOMMENDATION . SOCIAL DISTANCING IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT. IT'S A SCIENTIFIC RECOMMENDATION . TESTING, TRACING, DEVELOPMENT, APPROVAL, AND DISTRIBUTION OF A VACCINE IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT. IT IS A SCIENCE-BASED DECISION. WE CANNOT DO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE. WE CANNOT GO BACK. WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER. WE CAN DO BETTER STARTING TODAY. WE CAN HAVE A NATIONAL STRATEGY THAT PUTS POLITICS ASIDE AND SAVES LIVES. WE CAN HAVE A NATIONAL STRATEGY THAT WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES TO OPEN SAFELY. WE CAN HAVE A NATIONAL STRATEGY THAT REFLECTS THE TRUE VALUES OF THIS NATION. THIS PANDEMIC IS NOT A RED STATE OR BLUE STATE ISSUE. THIS VIRUS DOES NOT CARE WHERE YOU LIVE OR WHAT POLITICAL PARTY YOU BELONG TO. IT AFFECTS US ALL. IT WILL TAKE ANYONE'S LIFE. IT'S A VIRUS. IT'S NOT A POLITICAL WEAPON. THERE'S ANOTHER ENDURING DIVISION IN AMERICA THAT WE MUST AND , THAT WE MUST END , THE DIVISION OF OUR ECONOMIC LIFE THAT GIVES OPPORTUNITY TO ONLY THE PRIVILEGED FEW. AMERICA HAS TO BE ABOUT MOBILITY. IT HAS TO BE THE KIND OF COUNTRY WHERE AN ABRAHAM LINCOLN, A CHILD OF THE DISTANT FRONTIER, CAN RISE TO THE HIGHEST OFFICE OF THE LAND. AMERICA HAS TO BE ABOUT POSSIBILITY , THE POSSIBILITY OF PROSPERITY, NOT JUST FOR THE PRIVILEGED FEW, BUT FOR THE MANY, FOR ALL OF US, WORKING PEOPLE AND THEIR KIDS DESERVE AN OPPORTUNITY. LINCOLN KNEW THIS. HE SAID THE COUNTRY HAD TO GIVE PEOPLE AN OPEN FIELD AND A FAIR CHANCE. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IN THE AMERICA THAT WE ARE GOING TO BUILD TOGETHER. WE FOUGHT A CIVIL WAR THAT WOULD SECURE A UNION, THAT WOULD SEEK TO FULFILL THE PROMISE OF EQUALITY FOR ALL, AND BY FITS AND STARTS, OUR BETTER ANGELS HAVE PREVAILED JUST ENOUGH AGAINST OUR WORST IMPULSES TO MAKE A NEW AND BETTER NATION, AND THOSE BETTER ANGELS CAN PREVAIL AGAIN NOW. THEY MUST PREVAIL AGAIN NOW. 100 YEARS AFTER LINCOLN SPOKE AT GETTYSBURG, THE VICE PRESIDENT, LYNDON B. JOHNSON, ALSO CAME HERE. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID , HE SAID, OUR NATION FOUND ITS SOLE AND HONOR IN GETTYSBURG. WE MUST NOT LOSE THAT SOUL AND HONOR ON THE FIELDS OF HATE. TODAY, WE ENGAGE ONCE AGAIN IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. THE FORCES OF DARKNESS, THE FORCES OF DIVISION, THE FORCES OF YESTERDAY ARE PULLING US APART, HOLDING US DOWN AND HOLDING US BACK. WE MUST FREE OURSELVES OF ALL OF THAT. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL EMBRACE HOPE, NOT FEAR, PEACE, NONVIOLENCE, GENEROSITY, NOT GREED, AND LIGHT, NOT DARKNESS. I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO APPEALS TO THE BEST OF US, NOT THE WORST. I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO PUSHES TOWARD THE FUTURE, NOT ONE WHO CLINGS TO THE PAST. I'M READY TO FIGHT FOR YOU AND FOR OUR NATION EVERY DAY WITHOUT EXCEPTION, WITHOUT RESERVATION AND WITH A FULL AND DEVOTED HEART. WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT ALLOW EXTREMIST AND WHITE SUPREMACISTS TO OVERTURN THE LEGACY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND HARRIET TUBMAN AND FREDERICK DOUGLASS. DON'T RETURN TO THE AMERICA THAT HAS BEEN A HAVEN AND HOME , TO RETURN TO THE AMERICA THAT HAS BEEN A HAVEN AT HOME FOR EVERYONE, NO MATTER THEIR BACKGROUND. WE ARE AT OUR BEST WHEN THE PROMISE OF AMERICA IS AVAILABLE FOR ALL. WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT ALLOW VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS TO THREATEN THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION. WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT WALK AWAY FROM OUR OBLIGATIONS TO AT LONG LAST FACE THE RECKONING ON RACE AND RACIAL JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT CONTINUE TO BE STRUCK IN THE PARTISAN POLITICS THAT LETS THIS VIRUS THRIVE WHILE THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF THIS NATION SUFFERS. WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT ACCEPT AN ECONOMIC EQUATION THAT ONLY FAVORS THOSE WHO ALREADY GOT IT MADE , WHO HAVE ALREADY GOT IT MADE. EVERYONE DESERVES A SHOT AT PROSPERITY. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, DUTY AND HISTORY CALL PRESIDENTS TO PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON GOOD, AND I WILL. IT WON'T BE EASY. IT WON'T BE EASY. OUR DIVISIONS TODAY ARE LONG-STANDING. ECONOMIC AND RACIAL INEQUITIES HAVE SHAPED US FOR GENERATIONS, BUT I GIVE YOU MY WORD , I GIVE YOU MY WORD, IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL MARSHALL THE INGENUITY AND GOODWILL OF THIS NATION TO BRING US TOGETHER BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR THAT. WE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. WE MUST TAKE THE FIRST STEPS AND START WITH HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER, HOW WE TALK TO ONE ANOTHER, HOW WE RESPECT ONE ANOTHER. LINCOLN SAID WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE, WITH CHARITY FOR ALL, WITH FIRMNESS AND THE RIGHT GOD GIVES US TO SEE THE RIGHT, LET US STRIVE TO FINISH THE WORK WE ARE IN TWO FIND THE NATION'S WOUNDS. NOW WE HAVE OUR WORK TO REUNITE AMERICA, TO BIND UP OUR NATION'S WOUNDS SO WE, YOU AND I TOGETHER , CAN PRESS ON EVEN NOW. AFTER HEARING THE SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS, FREDERICK DOUGLASS TOLD PRESIDENT LINCOLN THAT WAS A SACRED EFFORT. WE HAVE TO BE DEDICATED TO OUR OWN SACRED EFFORT. THE PROMISE OF GETTYSBURG AND THE NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM WAS AT HAND. I THINK IT'S AT RISK. EVERY GENERATION THAT HAS FOLLOWED GETTYSBURG HAS BEEN FACED WITH A MOMENT WHEN IT MUST ANSWER THIS QUESTION, IF IT WILL ALLOW THE SACRIFICES MADE HERE TO BE IN VAIN OR BE FULFILLED. THIS IS OUR MOMENT TO ANSWER THIS ESSENTIAL AMERICAN QUESTION FOR OURSELVES AND FOR OUR TIME. MY ANSWER IS THIS , IT CANNOT BE THAT AFTER ALL THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH, AFTER ALL THAT AMERICA HAS ACCOMPLISHED, AFTER ALL THE YEARS WE HAVE STOOD AS A BEACON OF LIGHT TO THE WORLD, IT CANNOT BE THAT HERE AND NOW IN 2020, WE WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE TO PERISH ON THIS EARTH. NO, IT CANNOT AND IT MUST NOT. WE HAVE IN OUR HANDS THE ONLY POWER , THE POWER TO VOTE. IT'S THE NOBLEST INSTRUMENT EVER DEVISED TO REGISTER OUR WILL IN A PEACEABLE AND PRODUCTIVE FASHION, AND SO WE MUST , WE MUST VOTE. WE WILL VOTE, NO MATTER HOW MANY OBSTACLES ARE THROWN IN OUR WAY BECAUSE ONCE AMERICA VOTES, AMERICA WILL BE HEARD. LINCOLN SAID THE NATION IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR. SO IT WAS, AND SO IT IS. TOGETHER AS ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, LET'S JOIN FORCES TO FIGHT THE COMMON FOE OF INJUSTICE AND INEQUALITY, HATE AND FEAR. LET'S CONDUCT OURSELVES AS AMERICANS WHO LOVE EACH OTHER, WHO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, WHO WILL NOT DESTROY BUT WILL BUILD. WE OWE IT TO THE DEAD WHO ARE BURIED HERE GETTYSBURG. WE OWE THAT TO THE LIVING AND THE FUTURE GENERATIONS YET TO BE BORN. YOU AND I ARE PART OF A COVENANT, A COMMON STORY OF DIVISIONS OVERCOME AND HOPE RENEWED. IF WE DO OUR PART, IF WE STAND TOGETHER, IF WE KEEP FAITH WITH THE PAST AND WITH EACH OTHER, THEN DIVISIONS IN TIME WILL GIVE WAY TO A BETTER DREAM OF THE FUTURE. THIS IS OUR WORK. THIS IS OUR DREAM. THIS IS OUR MISSION. WE CAN AND , WE CAN END THE HATE AND FEAR. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST , THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. THANK YOU. WE CAN DO THIS.

I THINK PITTS WAS UNDISCIPLINED, AND THE DO NOT THINK THAT HARRIS WAS STRONG ENOUGH ON SOME OF THE POINTS THAT SHE COULD'VE BEEN. PENCE LIED BY SHAKING HIS HEAD TO THE NEGATIVE WHEN HE KNEW THAT OUT OF 50 JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS THAT NOT ONE HAS BEEN BLOCKED, AS HARRIS POINTED OUT. I DO NOT THINK THAT SHE WAS FORCEFUL IN THE FACT THAT WHEN HE ASKED HER A QUESTION ABOUT PACKING THE COURT, SHE SHOULD HAVE POINTED OUT THAT HE WAS NOT THERE TO ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS, BUT RESPOND TO THE MODERATOR. WHEN IT COMES TO THE MODERATOR, I THINKS THAT SHE DID A POOR JOB WHEN IT COMES TO MODERATOR. (music) THANK YOU ALSO MUCH. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS VANESSA MONTES CAR SURVEY , I AM THE DAUGHTER OF TWO HARD-WORKING MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME HERE IN SEARCH OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. MY MOTHER IS NO LONGER HERE, BUT VERY PRESENT IN MY HEART. SHE TAUGHT ME THE VALUE OF HARD WORK AND A SACRIFICE. SHE TAUGHT ME TO BE A WOMAN OF FAITH AND LOVE ABOVE ALL. I GREW UP IN PHOENIX ARIZONA. DUE TO THE IMMENSE SACRIFICE OF MY PARENTS HARD WORK, I WAS ABLE TO ATTEND A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL, AND I AM UP PROUD GRADUATE OF ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY. I AM A BUSINESS OWNER. I OWN SEVERAL SMALL BUSINESSES. INCLUDING LEGENDS EVENT CENTER. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR VENUES IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA. IF YOU TOLD ME EARLIER THIS YEAR, JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, THAT I WOULD BE STANDING FOR YOU, INTRODUCING YOU TO THE FUTURE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IT. THIS HAS BEEN A HARD YEAR FOR MANY OF US. IN MY INDUSTRY, THE EVENTS BUSINESS, WE HAVE FELT THE IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY HARD. MY BUSINESS WAS SHUT DOWN FOR SIX MONTHS. WE HAVE ONLY STARTED HOSTING SMALL EVENTS IN RECENT WEEKS. AFRAID FOR MY FAMILIES LIVELIHOOD, IT WAS A SACRIFICE THAT WE MADE TO KEEP OUR FRIENDS, BUT IT WASN'T EASY. WHILE BIG BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS BENEFITED FROM THE GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AND LOANS, MANY SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY THE LATINO COMMUNITY, WAS LEFT TO FEND FOR OURSELVES. OUR RESTAURANTS, OUR CLOTHING STORES, OUR TECH COMPANIES, WE ARE THE BACKBONE OF THIS COMMUNITY AND THIS CITY. WE ARE PROUD TO BE IN PLACES WHERE OUR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS CELEBRATE MAJOR MILESTONES AND SPEND THEIR HARD-EARNED MONEY. WE ARE PROUD TO BE A PLACE WHERE HARD WORK, ALONG WITH TALENT AND INNOVATION, CAN COME TOGETHER TO CREATE JOBS AND HELP US BUILD BETTER LIVES. WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IN SENATOR HARRIS UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF HARD WORK. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT MY BUSINESS IS MORE THAN JUST WHERE I WORK. IT IS PART OF WHO I AM. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WE MEASURE HOW GOOD OUR ECONOMY IS DOING BY HOW WELL OUR WORKERS ARE DOING, WHETHER THEIR WAGES ARE GOING UP AND WHETHER THEIR FAMILIES ARE ABLE TO GET AHEAD. AND WHETHER THEIR KIDS HAVE A BETTER LIFE AHEAD OF THEM. JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS HAVE A PLAN TO HELP US BUILD BACK BETTER. WE KNOW WHAT'S WE ARE GETTING UNDER DONALD TRUMP , WHAT WE ARE GETTING UNDER DONALD TRUMP. NO PLAN FOR COVID-19 AND NO PLAN TO HELP US SAFELY REOPEN OUR BUSINESSES. AS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, WE KNOW THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION. WHICH IS WHY I AM SO EXCITED EARLY VOTING STARTED YESTERDAY IN ARIZONA. I SAW PEOPLE LINED UP BEFORE THE POLLS OPENED TO BE THE FIRST AMONG TO CASTE THEIR BALLOTS. THIS CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER. I AM GOING TO BE A FIRST WEEK VOTER. TO MAKE SURE MY VOTE IS COUNTED FOR JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS, I AM VOTING NOT JUST FOR ME, I AM VOTING FOR MY WHOLE FAMILY, FOR MY SIX BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, AND FOR THEIR FUTURE. FOR MY FELLOW LATINOS PARENT , LATINOS. I HAVE FAITH THAT WE WILL ELECT THE LEADERS THAT WILL RESTORE THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. AS MR. BIDEN SAYS , [SPEAKING SPANISH] TOGETHER, WE WILL BUILD BACK BETTER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS MY GREAT PRIVILEGE AND HONOR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU TWO STRONG AND OUTSTANDING LEADERS, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. (music) HI, EVERYBODY. WHERE IS VANESSA? THANK YOU, VANESSA. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT INTRODUCTION AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ALL YOU DO FOR THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. IT IS GOOD TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF LABOR. EARLIER, JOE AND I HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT THE INDIAN VETERANS NATIONAL MEMORIAL AND TAKE TRIBUTE TO THE AID OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN UNIFORM. WE WERE JOINED BY CINDY MCCAIN, A LONGTIME FRIEND OF JOE'S, AND SOMEONE I ADMIRE. I WAS FORTUNATE TO SERVE WITH JOHN MCCAIN IN THE SENATE AND WHAT AN INCREDIBLE AMERICAN. HE WAS A PATRIOT OF THE HIGHEST ORDER AND CINDY IS SUPPORTING OUR CAMPAIGN. [APPLAUSE] AND SHE IS DOING IT BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT JOE AND I WILL ALWAYS DO WHAT SHE AND JOHN DID, AND THAT IS PUT OUR COUNTRY FIRST. SO WE THANK CITY , CINDY, WE ARE GRATEFUL TO BE IN ARIZONA TODAY. LATER, WE WILL TALK WITH WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE WORKING SO HARD AND DOING EVERYTHING RIGHTS, BUT STILL STRUGGLING TO GET BY. THEY ARE WHO I WAS THINKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE. THIS ELECTION, MORE THAN ANY OTHER IN OUR LIFETIME, WILL AFFECT EVERY PART OF OUR LIVES. THE CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY LAST GENERATIONS. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. OUR NATION IS AT A CROSSROADS. JUST THINK, ALL AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE PANDEMIC, THE RECESSION, A RECKONING ON RACIAL JUSTICE, A CHANGING CLIMATE THAT IS BATTERING OUR COASTLINES AND SETTING THE WEST ON FIRE, AND THE FUTURE OF HEALTH CARE HANGS ON TOP OF IT ALL. BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN THE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ALONG WITH SENATE REPUBLICANS, HE IS TRYING TO JAM THROUGH A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WHO WILL DO EXACTLY THAT. WHO WILL RIP AWAY PROTECTIONS FROM AS MANY AS 2.8 MILLION ARIZONANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. TWO POINT EIGHT ARIZONANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WHILE THIS PRESIDENT DID NOT BRING THE VIRUS TO OUR SHORES, HIS RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE AND FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAS ALLOWED IT TO SPREAD THE WAY WE HAVE SEEN IN THE CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN IN NORMA'S , ENORMOUS. HIS REFUSAL TO CONTAIN THIS VIRUS IS WHAT HAS WREAKED HAVOC ON OUR ECONOMY. I KNOW FOLKS ARE HURTING BUT I ALSO KNOW THIS. WE CAN OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES. IF WE ELECT JOE BIDEN AS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IS THE THING. JOE HAS HAD A PLAN FOR COVID AT LEAST SINCE MARCH. HE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS, HE KNOWS WHAT THIS MEANS AND THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT IS REQUIRED TO GET IT UNDER CONTROL. JOE KNOWS THESE THINGS. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT. EVEN WHEN JOE DID NOT HAVE THE BRIEFINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE HAD , MIKE PENCE HAD , JOE NEWBY BECAUSE OF EXPERIENCE THAT THIS COULD BE SERIOUS AND UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, WE WILL CONTAIN THIS VIRUS AND SAVE LIVES AND BUILD OUR ECONOMY BACK BETTER THAN BEFORE. JOE WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO RESTORES THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. HE WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO CREATES GOOD PAYING JOBS AND EASES THE BURDEN ON WORKING FAMILIES. AND ABOVE ALL, JOE WILL BE A RESIDENT WHO UNITES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN AND INDEPENDENT, OLD AND YOUNG, FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS AND RACES TO MEET THE GREATEST CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME. I PLAN ON BEING RIGHT BY HIS SIDE AND , [APPLAUSE] , AND WE WILL BE REDDY ON DAY ONE. , READY ON DAY ONE. HERE IS THE THING, ARIZONA. WE NEED YOUR HELP. WE HAVE ONLY 26 DAYS LET'S NOT WAKE UP THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION WISHING WE HAD DONE MORE. LET'S ORGANIZE AND VOTE IN NUMBERS NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. LET'S SEND MARK KELLY TO THE SENATE. [APPLAUSE] VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT REALLY DOES. YESTERDAY, ARIZONA, VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS WERE SHIPPED TO HOMES ACROSS THIS STATE AND EARLY VOTING HAS STARTED, INCLUDING AT THE NEW MCDOWELL SQUARE VOTING CENTER ABOUT A MILE FROM HERE. SO BE A FIRST WEEK VOTER. THERE ARE FOUR WAYS TO VOTE IN ARIZONA.

SO LET'S ELECT JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I INTRODUCE TO YOU THE GREAT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] (music) HELLO, ARIZONA. [APPLAUSE] IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK. IT REALLY IS. THANK YOU, KAMALA. THANK YOU, VANESSA. WE MET BACKSTAGE AND THE FIRST INSTANT WE HAD WAS TO HUG EACH OTHER , NO, WE HAVE TO STAY 12 FEET APART. I WANT TO GIVE A SPECIAL THANKS TO RUBEN AND DANIEL FOR BEING HERE. BIG DEAL, MAN. I NOTICE , THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A POSTMAN'S HOLIDAY, COMING TO HEAR ANOTHER POLITICIAN SPEAK. AND PUTTING ON A TIE WHEN HE SHOWS UP WITHOUT A TIE. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. THE PRESIDENT AND COO OF THE SOUTHWEST REGIONAL COUNCIL. WHERE ARE YOU? IS IN HERE OR IS HE IN HIS OFFICE? I WANT TO THANK HIM. ALSO, THE PRESIDENT OF LOCAL 1912. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING, WE SAID, NOT A JOKE, IT WAS COINCIDENTAL, SHE SAID, I LOVE THE CARPENTERS, THE FIRST OUTFIT THAT ENDORSED ME WHEN I RAN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THE CARPENTERS. I SAID, I REMEMBER A GUY, PRESIDENT OF THE CARPENTERS UNION FROM DELAWARE, A 350-YEAR-OLD CITY, WAS THE FIRST WANT TO ENDORSE ME AS WELL. WE HAVE BEEN WITH THEM MICHAEL CAREER. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME FRIEND, WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER A LONG TIME. 520,000 CARPENTERS, THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE ARMY TO HAVE BEHIND YOU. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU HAVE MY FULL CAREER AND I HOPE YOU KNOW I HAVE HAD YOURS AS WELL. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN SCRANTON, THE CARPENTERS BROUGHT ME TO THE DANCE AND WE ARE GOING HOME TOGETHER. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. PEOPLE WHO SHAPED THE SKYLINES, WHO BUILT THE FOUNDATIONS WE RELY ON, THE CARPENTERS. LABOR BROUGHT ME TO DANCE AND THE ONLY REASON WHY I'VE ABLE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE OF LABOR. I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME AND YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE COUNTRY. I REALLY MEAN IT. I GET IN TROUBLE FOR SAYING THIS, BUT IT IS TRUE. YOU ARE THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA, THE SPINE OF AMERICA. YOU ARE THE ONES YOU BUILD THE COUNTRY, NOT WALL STREET AND CEO'S, YOU ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO BE BUILD IT AGAIN AND YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD IT BACK BETTER FOR REAL. KAMALA AND I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAUGHT IT, BUT THE SENATOR HAD A HECK OF A NIGHT LAST NIGHT. [APPLAUSE] I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU WANT TO GIVE ME CREDIT FOR KNOWING HOW TO PICK A VICE PRESIDENT. I COULD NOT BE PROUDER. SHE IS LIKE A YOUNGER SISTER. REMARKABLE CHARACTER AND VISION. ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR THE PEOPLE. ALWAYS SOMEBODY ELSE, NOT HER, ALWAYS. I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. KEMAL AND I ARE ABOUT TO KICK OFF A TOUR VISITING BUSINESSES IN THIS COMMUNITY. SMALL BUSINESSES IN THIS COMMUNITY AND ALL COMMUNITIES ARE MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE JOBS IN THE COMMUNITY, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, THEY ARE BUSTING THEIR NEXT, THAN THE MAJOR CORPORATIONS. SMALL BUSINESSES CREATE MORE JOBS THAN THE MAJOR CORPORATE ENTITIES. THIS COMMUNITY HAS FOUND ITSELF HAVING TO GO THROUGH REAL CHALLENGING TIMES. THE CONGRESSMAN KNOWS MORE ABOUT IT THAN MOST PEOPLE KNOW. LIKE CHEF SOLANA, THE CHEF OWNS TWO RESTAURANTS IN PHOENIX. ONE, SHE HAD , SHE HAD TO CLOSE ONE OF THEM DOWN. SHE IS WORKING HARD TO KEEP THE OTHER ONE AFLOAT. WE ARE GOING TO BE VISITING IT LATER THIS AFTERNOON. IT ISN'T EASY. THE LOAN THEY WERE ABLE TO SECURE BACK IN THE SPRING BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION PASSED BY DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE HELPS FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH. SHE IS SCRAPING BY, TRYING TO LOOK OUT FOR HER 10 EMPLOYEES, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN WITH HER FOR DECADES. ON TOP OF THAT, SHE IS FACING A TERMINAL DISEASE. SHE HAD TO CANCEL HER OWN HEALTH INSURANCE AFTER FINISHING A ROUND OF TREATMENT TO RECENTLY JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. IT IS DEVASTATING. EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE UPSET ABOUT WHAT SHE IS GOING THROUGH. I THINK YOU ALL ARE. I KNOW I AM BECAUSE I KNOW WE KNOW IT DID NOT HAVE TO HAPPEN. IF THEY HAD JUST DONE WHAT YOU PASSED, JUST MOVED FORWARD. HER STORY IS INCREASINGLY A COMMON STORY OF ARIZONA WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. TOO MANY ARE FACING HARD TIMES NOW. THEY ARE TRYING THEIR BEST BUT IT NEVER FEELS LIKE IT IS ENOUGH. YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, YOU ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A FAIR SHOT. ALL THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. THAT IS HOW MY DAD FELT WHEN HE COULD NOT FIND WORK WHEN COLD DIED , COAL DIED. HE HAD TO TAKE US UP THE LONGEST WALK A PARENT EVER HAS TO TAKE TO SAY, I'M SORRY, YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO ST. PAUL'S, THAT HAS LOST HIS JOB, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE. I REMEMBER HIM TAKING US TO OUR GRANDPA'S HOUSE, ME AND MY BROTHER AND MY SISTER AND MY MOM WHO WAS SHORTLY GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER CHILD AND I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW HARD IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR MY DAD, SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN HAVE DONE THE SAME THING, HAD TO GO TO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW AND SAY, I HAVE TO ASK A FAVOR. I KNOW HOW MUCH PRIDE IT COST HIM. CAN YOU TAKE THEIR OF THEM , CAN YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT FOR A YEAR? I WILL BE BACK. IT SEEMS LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD BUT BY THE TIME HE WAS ABLE TO GET A GOOD JOB, ENOUGH TO GET US AN APARTMENT IN DELAWARE, HE ENDED UP THEN GETTING A GOOD JOB, A DECENT JOB MANAGING A CAR DEALERSHIP. HE WORKED HARD TO BUILD A DECENT MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. HE HAD AN EXPRESSION. I MEAN THIS SINCERELY. HE SAID, I DON'T EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS, BUT I EXPECT THEM TO AT LEAST UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. AMERICA DESERVES A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE AMERICA , WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. WHO SEES WHO YOU ARE, WHAT YOU WANT TO BE, WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR HEALTH, YOUR PROSPERITY, YOUR DREAM, YOUR AMERICAN DREAM. YOU ARE FACING REAL CHALLENGES AND THE LAST THING YOU NEED IS A PRESIDENT TO EXACERBATES THEM. WHO IGNORES YOU. I'M GOING TO SAY IT, I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT, THE PRESIDENT LOOKS DOWN ON US. WHO THINKS THAT IF YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE FOR THE NATION, YOU ARE A LOSER, A SUCKER. THIS IS WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH CINDY. MY SON PASSED AWAY NOW COMING ON FIVE YEARS, IT SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY, WON THE BRONZE STAR, HE VOLUNTEERED, HE WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL, HE HAD TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. I PROMISE YOU, HE WAS NOT A LOSER, HE WAS NOT A SUCKER. HE, LIKE ALL THE VETERANS WE MET WITH THIS AFTERNOON ALONGSIDE CINDY MCCAIN, ARE PATRIOTS. THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THAT BEING AN AMERICAN IS ABOUT RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS BIGGER THAN YOURSELF. JOHN MCCAIN, WHO I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF ASKING ME TO DO HIS EULOGY, WE USED TO ARGUE, WE WERE LIKE BROTHERS, WE WOULD FIGHT LIKE HELL, BUT WE ALWAYS ENDED UP TOGETHER. THAT IS HOW IT USED TO BE. IT USED TO BE THAT WAY ACROSS THE BOARD. HE WAS NOT A LOSER. THEY ARE ALL HEROES. THEY DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO WILL SAY ANYTHING TO DEFLECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY MISTAKES HE MAKES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED, HE RECENTLY SAID , I ASKED WHERE HE GOT THE COVID, HE SAID, I PROBABLY GOT IT FROM BLUE STAR PARENTS, PEOPLE WHO LOST A CHILD IN BATTLE. HE SAID, THEY LIKE TO GET CLOSE TO ME AND HUGGED ME, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY NO. LOOK. WE HAVE PAID TOO HIGH A PRICE FOR DONALD TRUMP'S CHAOTIC LEADERSHIP. 210,000 AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS VIRUS. WE LOSE MORE EVERY DAY. 6000 ARIZONANS HAVE BEEN LOST. 6000, DON. , GONE. 200 , 220,000 ARIZONANS HAVE BEEN INFECTED. 122,000 JOBS IN ARIZONA STILL HAVE NOT COME BACK. NINE TIMES MORE ARIZONANS ARE ON UNEMPLOYMENT EACH WEEK THEN BEFORE THE CRISIS HIT. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING, SCHOOLS ARE NOT BACK TO NORMAL. DONALD TRUMP CAN'T FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS. THE HOUSE PASSED THE HEROES ACTS, THE SECOND BIG PACKAGE, TO GET PEOPLE ON THEIR FEET AGAIN. BUT THE PRESIDENT AND MITCH MCCONNELL DID NOTHING TO MOVE THE LEGISLATION. A LOT OF CITIES AND STATES ARE GOING BANKRUPT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS. OUR FOUNDERS WERE SMART, THE REASON WHY THEY PUT THE CONSTITUTION THE WAY THEY DID IS SO CONGRESS, THE SENATE, THE HOUSE GOOD DEFICIT SPEND TO COMPENSATE FOR BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE WE GET OUT OF A HOLE. TRUMP IS SPENDING MORE TIME , I HAVE BEEN CALLING ON THIS FOR THE LAST FOUR MONTHS , HE SHOULD GET OUT OF HIS BUNKER AND OUT OF THE SAND TRAP OF HIS GOLF COURSES , NOT A JOKE, THINK ABOUT IT. I HAVE BEEN AROUND A WHILE. HE NEVER ONE SINGLE TIME TRY TO BRING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO TRY TO GET A SETTLEMENT. NOT ONCE. YOU CAN'T NAME ME A PRESIDENT IN THE LIFETIME OF ANY OF YOU THAT REFUSED TO DEAL THAT WAY IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS. BUT THE LEADERSHIP OF CONGRESS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT ON HIS WATCH. ON TUESDAY, THE CONGRESS , I'M SURE YOU WERE NOT SURPRISED BY IT , ON TUESDAY, HE ANNOUNCED HE IS WALKING AWAY FROM NEGOTIATIONS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RELIEF FOR WORKING THE WEALTHY. IF THIS WAS NOT SO TRUE, IT WOULD SOUND SO BIZARRE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS FORGOTTEN THE PEOPLE THAT HE SAID HE IS FIGHTING FOR. I WILL NEVER FORGET, BECAUSE I SEE THE WORLD FOR WHERE I GREW IN SCRANTON. I NOTE THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS, THAT THE WORKING CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. I MEASURE ECONOMIC SUCCESS WITH WHAT FAMILIES ARE TALKING ABOUT, SITTING AROUND THEIR KITCHEN TABLES. ABOUT HAVING A DECENT JOB AND BENEFITS. ABOUT KEEPING THE SMALL BUSINESS DREAM ALIVE. ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT TOOK PLACE THIS MORNING. NEW TIRES. WE HAVE TO WAIT. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GET THEM. WE CANNOT DO IT. WHO IS GOING TO TELL HER THAT SHE CANNOT GO BACK TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE BECAUSE WE CANNOT BORROW MONEY ANYMORE. WE HAVE 20 MILLION PEOPLE TODAY. INCLUDING HERE IN ARIZONA. WHO WORRIED ABOUT IF THEY CAN PAY THIS MONTH'S MORTGAGE PAYMENT. 20 MILLION. LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET THROWN OUT INDUSTRY IF THEY CANNOT PAY THE RENT. THESE GUYS PROVIDED FOR ALL OF THAT. NOTHING. BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE. MY DAD USED TO SAY THAT JOEY, YOUR JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN ABOUT YOUR PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. ABOUT RESPECT. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. AND MEAN IT. THAT IS WHAT KAMALA AND I ARE FOCUSING ON. TO SAY TO OUR KIDS, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WE ARE GOING TO GET THIS VIRUS UNDER CONTROL. WE'RE GOING TO REOPEN SAFELY AND STRONGLY. IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, WE HAVE TO GET , WE HAVE TO DO IT TOGETHER. YOU HAVE A LOT OF THINGS DONE SHOW, BUT THAT WAS THE PAST. IF WE CANNOT BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, WE ARE DEAD. THIS IS A DEMOCRACY THAT DEPENDS ON A CONSENSUS. YOU HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. IT WAS SOMEWHAT PRESUMPTUOUS OF ME, BUT I MADE A MAJOR SPEECH THAT I WORKED ON REALLY HARD IN GETTYSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA. I DID IT TWO DAYS AGO. I TALKED ABOUT IN LINCOLN TERMS, THAT WE HAVE TO BRING AMERICA TOGETHER. WE CANNOT HOLD GRUDGES. I'M RUNNING WITH A PROUD DEMOCRAT, WITH A CAPITAL D. BY WILL BE AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT, NOT A DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK HARD FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT SUPPORT ME. I PROMISE YOU. LOOK AMERICA. THE FACT IS, THAT IS THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT. IT IS A DUTY TO CARE. FOR EVERYBODY. DOCTORS WHO VOTED FOR. AFTER ALL THAT WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH. ALL THE AMERICANS HAVE ACCOMPLISHED, WE CANNOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO REMAIN DIVIDED. WE HAVE THE POWER IN OUR HANDS, AND DO NOTE THAT POWER IS? THE LITTLE STICKER THAT YOU HAVE ON. THE POWER TO VOTE. YOU CAN STILL REGISTER HERE IN ARIZONA TO VOTE. EARLY VOTING HAS ALREADY BEGUN. THE VAST MAJORITY OF ARIZONANS VOTE BY MAIL. THOSE BALLOTS START TO ARRIVE AT THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. KAMALA AND I ARE SAYING THAT THE BEST THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO RETURN YOUR BALLOT QUICKLY, AND NOT RISK DELAYS. TURN THE MAIL-IN BALLOT AS SOON AS YOU CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR VOICE IS HEARD. YOUR VOICE CAN OVERCOME CORRECT AND YOUR VOICE THROUGH YOUR VOTE, CAN OVERCOME EVERY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SETTING UP? THE ARGUMENT THAT THESE VOTES ARE NOT GOING TO MATTER. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENS TODAY WITH THE FBI. THE FBI ARRESTED A GROUP OF MILITIAMEN. THEY HAD PLANNED AND PLANNED TO GO IN AND KIDNAP THE GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN. REMEMBER THOSE GUYS WOULD BE ASSAULT RIFLES STANDING IN THEIR DRIVEWAYS? THE PRESIDENT SAYING THINGS IN MY DEBATE WITH THEM, TO THE PROUD BOYS, AND ALL WHITE THE PREMISES GROUP, STANDS DOWN AND STAND READY? THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF. WE CANNOT JUST WIN BY A VOTE. WE HAVE TO ALL TURN OUT. WE CAN BE BETTER THAN WE HAVE SEEN. WE CAN'T BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BREASTS. , WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST. AT OUR BEST, WE ARE THAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT IS NOT A PROSAIC THING. THE FACT IS, AMERICANS NEVER FAIL. WHEN STANDING UP TOGETHER. WE ARE THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD THAT HAS COME OUT OF EVERY CRISIS, WAR AND ECONOMIC, STRONGER THAN WE WENT INTO THE CRISIS. FOLKS, I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES AT HOME AND IN THE WORLD THAN I HAVE BEEN IN A LONG TIME. I WORK WITH A LOT OF PRESIDENTS. I MEAN IT. WE HAVE A CHANCE. TO NOT ONLY IMPROVE OUR COUNTRY, BUT TO CHANGE THE WORLD. WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, BUT THAT IS NOT WHY THE WEST OF THE WORLD COMPARES TO US. , THE REST OF THE WORLD COMPARES TO U.S.. IT IS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER, BUT A POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE THAT HAS THE REST OF THE WORLD FOLLOWING US. THAT EXAMPLE IS BEING TRASH AROUND THE WORLD. AS THE SENATOR SAID LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE, IT IS TRUE. 17 MAJOR COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD 'S ASKS WHAT LEADERS THEY ADMIRE AND TRUST THE MOST. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY? MORE PEOPLE TRUSTED THE LEADER OF CHINA AND PUTIN OF RUSSIA RATHER THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT HAS PROFOUND SECURITY AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS. LET'S NOT QUIT FOLKS. THERE IS NO QUITTING IN AMERICA. WE HAVE NEVER QUIT, AND IF WE NEED YOU TO STAND UP AT ANY TIME IN OUR HISTORY, WE NEED YOU NOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOD BLESS YOU. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music) THANK YOU EVERYBODY. (music) MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND. GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND YOU MAY HAVE THE RIGHT WE ARE ALL LIVING AN EXAMPLE GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND. GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND GIVE US WHAT YOU GET. DON'T LET OUR WORLD GO ROUND.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?476759-1\/joe-biden-senator-harris-campaign-arizona","Summary":"2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and running mate Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) campaigned in Arizona the day after the vice presidential debate.","Source":"476759-1","Type":"Speech"}

HELLO, LAS VEGAS. GOVERNOR'S IS A LACK, REPRESENTATIVE TITUS AND MY GOOD FRIEND , ACTUALLY HE IS A GREAT FRIEND , CONGRESSMAN WERE SPURRED. I WANT TO THANK THE PRINCIPLE OF THIS GREAT SCHOOL, , PRINCIPAL OF THIS GREAT SCHOOL FOR HOSTING THIS. JUST WHAT YOU NEED IT TODAY. I KNOW YOU , JUST WHAT YOU NEEDED TODAY. I KNOW YOU WANT THE STUDENTS TO BE BACK. I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE DURING THIS CHALLENGING TIME. ALARCON DROVE, THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION , ALEJANDRO, THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION. YOU AND ALL THOSE WHO CHOSE TO COME HERE TO BECOME PARENTS IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU ARE WHY WE ARE WHO WE ARE. THANK YOU. YOU ARE JUST TRY TO DO RIGHT BY YOUR FAMILY, LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I JUST LEFT THE LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY CENTER WHERE SENATOR ED FLOREZ, THE SON OF MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS , YOU GET TO SWEAR IN HIS DAD AS THE UNITED STATES CITIZEN LAST WEEK. HE BECAME A LAWYER TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF IMMIGRANTS AND MAKE SURE , I'M THAT WITH A GROUP OF LATINO LEADERS WHO WILL FIGHT FOR RESPECT AND DIGNITY WE ARE ALL ENTITLED TO, NO MATTER WHO WE ARE OR WHERE WE COME FROM. YESTERDAY, I MET WITH KAMALA HARRIS AFTER HER OUTSTANDING DEBATE PERFORMANCE. I COULD NOT BE PROUDER TO BE RUNNING ALONGSIDE HER. SHE IS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR THE PEOPLE, LOOKING OUT FOR YOU. WE MET WITH CINDY MCCAIN. THE WIFE, THE WIDOW, OF A DEAR FRIEND JOHN MCCAIN. WE MET WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, JUST A FAIR SHOT. WHEN I WAS IN GRADE SCHOOL MY DAD WOULD SAY , WE HAD TO MOVE IN WITH MY GRANDPARENTS WHEN HE WENT DOWN SOUTH FROM SCRANTON TO WILMINGTON, DELAWARE LOOKING FOR A JOB. HE USED TO ALWAYS SAY, YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS JOEY, I'M NOT LOOKING FOR GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS. I HOPE THEY CAN AT LEAST UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. HE WORKED HARD TO BUILD A DECENT MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. IT WASN'T EASY FOR HIM. HE HAD AN EXPRESSION. A JOB, JOEY, IS ABOUT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT BEING IN TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. YOU DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH, WHO SEES WHERE YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. THE LAST THING YOU NEED IS A PRESIDENT WHO IGNORES YOU, WHO LOOKS DOWN UPON YOU, AND JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE GOT WHERE WE ARE. THAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP. HIS RECKLESS PERSONAL CONDUCT SINCE HIS DIAGNOSIS, THE DESTABILIZING EFFECT ON OUR GOVERNMENT IS UNCONSCIONABLE. HE DID NOT TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO PROTECT HIMSELF OR OTHERS AND THE LONGER DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENTS, THE MORE , IS PRESIDENT, THE MORE RECKLESS HE GETS. HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO PROTECT THIS COUNTRY? GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE SEEN HOW HE PUTS GOVERNORS AGAINST EACH OTHER. MORE THAN 200,000 AMERICANS ARE DEAD. WE LOSE FROM 700 TO 1000 PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY IN AMERICA, WORSE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. MORE THAN 7.5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN INFECTED AND WE ARE STILL COUNTING. IN NEVADA, THERE ARE MORE THAN 82,000 CASES. 80% OF THE DEATHS HAVE BEEN SENIORS OVER 60 YEARS OF AGE, BLACK, LATINO, NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ARE ESPECIALLY HIT HARD. NATIONALLY THE INFECTION RATE AMONG LATINOS IS NEARLY THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OF OTHER , MY HEART GOES OUT TO ALL THIS FAMILIES. THIS MORNING, THERE IS AN EMPTY CHAIR AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE AND WHEN YOU GO TO DINNER AT NIGHT THE PERSON WHO SHOULD BE THERE IS GONE. THEY HAVE LOST PART OF THEIR SOUL. THEY HAVE LOST PART OF THEIR LIFE. IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY. FOR YOU AND I, IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY. LOSING FAMILY IS A DEVASTATING THING. WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER. MY HEART GOES OUT TO EVERYONE STRUGGLING WITH THE ECONOMIC CRISIS CAUSED BY THE SIMPLE NEGLECT OF THIS PRESIDENT. NEARLY I'M , 11 MILLION JOBS LOST THE BEGINNING OF THIS CRISIS AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT COME BACK. TEMPORARY LAYOFFS HAVE TURNED TO PERMANENT LAYOFFS. RECORD GROWTH AND AMERICANS FACING LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE PROBLEM OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT, ONCE YOU GET PAST A CERTAIN POINT HISTORY TELLS US, THEY NEVER GET A JOB AGAIN. ALL TOLD THERE'S 30 MILLION WORKERS WHO HAVE LOST HOURS, LOST PAYCHECKS, OR LOST THEIR JOBS. YULIA 700,000 PEOPLE HAVE DROPPED OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE AND THE VAST MAJORITY WERE WOMEN . WE ARE STILL DOWN 600 47,000 JOBS IN MANUFACTURING NATIONWIDE SINCE THE CRISIS STARTED. HERE IN NEVADA THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 13.2%, THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NEGLIGENCE. THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY HAS BEEN HIT PARTICULARLY HARD. 50% OF THOSE MEMBERS ARE OUT OF WORK. TOURISM WENT DOWN 70% FROM A YEAR AGO. THE RESULT? PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY SINCE HOOVER TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS THAN WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE. HERE IN NEVADA, AFTER SEEING 200,000 JOBS CREATED IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OF THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, THEY HAVE SEEN JOBS GO DOWN UNDER THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. HE IS LEAVING US INTO WHAT HE CALLS A V-SHAPED RECESSION. IT IS A K-SHAPED RECESSION. FOR THOSE OF THE TOPIC KEEPS GOING. FOR THE MIDDLE LEFT US FOR THOSE AT THE TOP, IT KEEPS GOING UP. FOR THOSE AT THE BOTTOM, IT KEEPS GOING DOWN. IS THE MOST UNEQUAL RECOVERY IN MODERN HISTORY. IF YOU GET THIS , THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA HAVE DONE PRETTY WELL. JUST IN THE PANDEMIC, THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES HAVE MADE AN ADDITIONAL $3 BILLION. TOP 100. WHEN YOU GET TO THE BOTTOM HALF OF THAT K, IT'S A DOWNWARD SLIDE. YOU'RE LEFT TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU WILL PAY YOUR BILLS, PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. SO MUCH FOOD INSECURITY AND AMERICA. BECAUSE OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PRESIDENT, THE KIDS CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE HE HAS NOT PROVIDED THE WHEREWITHAL FOR SCHOOLS TO OPEN. YOU'RE ASKED TO RISK YOUR NET BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WORK FROM HOME. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE A POLICE OFFICER, A NURSE FOR YOU WORK ON AN ASSEMBLY LINE. IF YOU ARE A HOUSEKEEPER, A CASINO WORKER , GOVERNOR, YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO TURN THINGS AROUND. GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE BEEN FOCUSED AND RESPONSIBLE. YOU FOLLOWED SCIENCE AND PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST. YOU MAKE CALLS TO REOPEN SCHOOLS IN THE ECONOMY SAFELY. YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE DONE THE SAME. AND THE HOUSE PASSED WHAT THEY CALL THE HEROES ACT MONTHS AGO. WOULD HAVE PROVIDED ALIENS OF DOLLARS TO KEEP FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE JOB. BUT DONALD TRUMP AND MITCH MCCONNELL, THE REPUBLICAN LEADER, DID NOTHING TO MOVE THE LEGISLATION. NOTHING IN JUNE, NOTHING IN AUGUST, NOTHING IN SEPTEMBER. THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. AS PEOPLE STRUGGLE AND SUFFER, WHAT DO THEY FOCUS ON. IF THIS WERE NOT SO SERIOUS YOU WOULD THINK I WAS MAKING IT UP. WHAT DO THEY FOCUS ON? MORE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY. I'M NOT JOKING. HIS PROPOSAL HAS ANOTHER TAX CUT FOR MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES. CUTTING THE MEANS BY WHICH WE FIND THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, LEAVING THE ACTUARIES TO SAY IF THEY DO IT, BY MID-2023 THERE WILL BE NO MONEY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. AND THE RELENTLESS EFFORT TO ELIMINATE THE OF PORTABLE CARE ACT WHICH PROVIDES HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR 22 MILLION PEOPLE. , 20 BILLION PEOPLE, 100 MILLION WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. HE HAS ALREADY COST 10 MILLION PEOPLE FOR , THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE THE COMPANIES HAVE GONE BANKRUPT. IS UNCONSCIONABLE , IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE. HE'S TRYING TO TAKE YOUR HEALTH CARE AWAY. IT'S LITERALLY BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AS I SPEAK, TO STRIKE DOWN THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ONE HUNDRED 82,000 NEVADANS. , 182,000 NEVADANS. TAKE AWAY PROTECTION FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID COULD VERY WELL BE THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. TOSSING OUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT ALLOWS CHILDREN TO BE COVERED ON THEIR PARENTS' INSURANCE POLICY UNTIL AT LEAST 26, TAKING US BACKWARD WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD CHARGE A WOMAN MORE JUST BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN. TAKE AWAY MEDICARE BENEFITS FOR SENIORS, INCREASED DRUG PRESCRIPTION COSTS, AND JUST AS HE VOWED TO \"TERMINATE\" THE FUNDING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. THE IDEA THAT IN JUST A FEW YEARS TO PUT AT RISK FOR HUNDRED 10,000 NEVADA TO RELY ON A DIGNIFIED RETIREMENT BECAUSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY , 410,000 NEVADANS WHO RELY ON A DIGNIFIED RETIREMENT BECAUSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY. NOT ONCE DID PRESIDENT TRUMP CALL A HIGH LEVEL MEETING OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES. I HAVE SERVED WITH A LOT OF PRESIDENTS. NEVER DID THEY FAIL TO TRY TO BRING PARTIES TOGETHER IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO REACH A SETTLEMENT. YOU KNOW WHY? HE SPENDS SO MUCH TIME HIDING IN THE BUNKER IN THE WHITE HOUSE, OR THE BUNKER OFF HIS GOLF COURSE, PLAYING HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS OF GOLF, AND THEN THIS TUESDAY, WHAT DID HE DO? HE SAID INTO THE DISCUSSIONS. HE WAS NOT EVEN STARTING THEM. NO MORE NEGOTIATIONS, NO MORE NEGOTIATIONS. AND TODAY HE SAYS, WELL, I'M BACK. DONALD TRUMP SHOWS NO URGENCY TO DELIVER HARD-WORKING AMERICANS, LIKE THE FAMILY I GREW UP IN AND LIKE ALL OF YOU, WHAT THEY NEED NOW, DESPERATELY. FOR EXACTLY TWO MONTHS SINCE THE EMERGENCY SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM THE CONGRESSPEOPLE VOTED FOR HAS CLOSE DOWN. TWO MONTHS OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN NEVADA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY WAITING AND HOPING FOR JUST A LITTLE EXTRA HELP TO STAY OPEN. NOW WE HAVE OVER 400,000 SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSED. MILLIONS MORE ARE STRUGGLING TO HANG ON. HOW MANY MORE WILL GO UNDER? MAKE NO MISTAKE, IF YOUR BUSINESS IS CLOSED, IF YOU ARE FACING EVICTION, OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS WORRY WHETHER THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE NEXT MONTH. NONE OF THAT SEEMS TO MATTER TO DONALD TRUMP. IF YOU ARE A FIREFIGHTER OR A POLICE OFFICER, HE HAS TURNED HIS BACK ON YOU AS WELL. WHEN BARACK AND I WERE ELECTED WE INHERITED THE WORST RECESSION SHORT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN HISTORY. WE PUT TOGETHER THE RECOVERY ACT. WE PUT TOGETHER IN 18 MONTHS TO PREVENT A RECESSION. I WAS ABLE TO SEE TO IT THAT THE STATES COULD KEEP MOVING, KEEP TEACHERS, FIRST RESPONDERS, FIREFIGHTERS MOVING. RIGHT HERE IN CLARK COUNTY I WAS ABLE TO BRING $1.2 BILLION TO KEEP YOUR ECONOMY GOING. WE HAVE THAT ABILITY NOW. THE HOUSE HAS ALREADY PASSED A SIMILAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND WE START THE LONGEST SUSTAINED RECOVERY IN AMERICAN HISTORY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL SAID ABOUT HELPING THE STATE? I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP. HE SAID, LET THEM GO BANKRUPT, LET THEM GO BANKRUPT. WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING ABOUT? WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE CAN CONTAIN THIS VIRUS AND FULLY REOPEN OUR ECONOMY. WE MAKE UP 4% OF THE WORLDS POPULATION AND WE HAVE 20% OF THE WORLD'S DEATHS. IF WE JUST FOLLOW THE SCIENCE, EXPANDED TESTING AND TRACING, SOCIAL DISTANCING, WASHING HER HANDS, NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATE , WASHING YOUR HANDS, NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATES. DON'T POLITICIZE THE RACE FOR A VACCINE, MR. PRESIDENT. JUST HAVE A PLAN FOR A SAFE AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION. HAVE A REAL PLAN AND THEN IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA I HAVE LAID OUT TO MAKE BOLD INVESTMENTS SO WE CAN LOOK BACK BETTER. HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS , SOME ARE IN SUPPORT OF ME. HE SAYS BIDEN IS GOING TO SPEND ALL THIS MONEY. MOODY DID A DETAILED ANALYSIS. MY ECONOMY WILL CREATE 18.6 MILLION JOBS, 7 MILLION MORE JOBS THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. YOU HAVE GOT TO GET THINGS DONE. THIS IS HOW MY PLAN IS , WORKS. IT IS NOT GOING TO RAISE UP HENNEY OF TAX. NOT A PENNY. HOW DO WE PAY FOR ALL THIS? I WOULD ASK THE CORPORATIONS AND THE WEALTHY TO START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. 92 DO NOT , 92 MILLION DO NOT PAY A PENALTY , A PENNY IN TALKING , AND TAXES. DONALD TRUMP PAID $720 IN TAXES? COME ON. THE MONEY WE RAISED BY LIMITING THE $1.3 TRILLION OF THE TAX CUTS THAT AFFECTS THE SUPER WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS, WE WILL GROW THE ECONOMY TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS INCLUDED ON THE DEAL. THE KINDS OF INVESTMENT THAT WILL STIMULATE THE ECONOMY,'S INCLUDING INDUSTRIES LIKE TOURISM. TO HELP THE ECONOMY BUILD BACK BETTER THAN BEFORE. IT MEANS CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS, MANUFACTURING AND SAID KNOWLEDGE HE, DUST TECHNOLOGY, MAKING SURE OUR FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA. WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE GIVES OUT $600 BILLION IN CONTRACTS FOR A YEAR, GUESS WHY? , GUESS WHAT? WHEN I AM PRESIDENT IT WILL GO TO KNOW OUTFIT THAT DOES NOT MAKE IT IN AMERICA AND SELL IT IN AMERICA. I MEAN IT. INFRASTRUCTURE, BUILDING ROADS, AIRPORTS, CLEAN ENERGY. WEATHERIZING 2 MILLION HOMES. CREATING AT LEAST A MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS, MAKING THE CLIMATE SAFER, SAVING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL. WE'LL DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE BY CREATING MILLIONS OF UNION JOBS. WE WILL FIGHT BACK STRONGER, THE MORE FREQUENT WILDFIRES. AND BY THE WAY. DID YOU HEAR WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID ABOUT HURRICANES THIS SUMMER? HE WAS TOLD HOW THEY WERE COMING ACROSS THE WARM WATER IN THE ATLANTIC AND THE CLOSER THEY GET TO THE SHORE THE WORST THEY GET. THAT'S THE WORST THEY GET , THE WORSE THEY GET. HE SAID MAYBE WE SHOULD DROP AN ATOMIC BOMB ON THEM. BLESS ME, FATHER, FOR I HAVE SENT. , FOR I HAVE SINNED. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE ANOTHER $100 BILLION IN LOW-INTEREST LOANS AVAILABLE FOR THESE BUSINESSES, CREATING JOB, INCREASING ECONOMIC GROWTH, INCREASING INCOMES. A $15 MINIMUM WAGE. A $15 MINIMUM WAGE FOR OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WE NOT JUST WENT TO PRAISE YOU. WE ARE GOING TO PAY YOU WITH A GOOD WAGE AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE STRONG BENEFIT. WE WILL BUILD THE , WE WILL CREATE SUBSIDIES TO INCREASE PLANS THAT WILL LOWER DEDUCTIBLES. IT IS A PLAN THAT WILL\/, SLASH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. IF IN FACT MEDICARE IS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE FOR ALL THE DRUGS THEY BUY AND SAY, YOU WILL NOT SELL THEM UNLESS THEY PAY THE PRICE THEY ARE SUGGESTING, THAT WOULD DROP BY 60% THE COST OF DRUGS. WE WILL ALSO MAKE HIGH-QUALITY CHILD CARE ACCESSIBLE AND WORK WITH STATES TO ENSURE THAT EVERY THREE AND FOUR-YEAR-OLD WILL GET ACCESS TO A HIGH-QUALITY PRESCHOOL, NOT DAYCARE. WE WILL ENSURE THAT LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WILL NEVER HAVE TO SPEND MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. IF WE WANT TO REWARD WORK ON THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF FAMILIES CARING FOR A CHILD OR AN AGING LOVED ONE. FOR THE PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS OUT THERE, OFTEN WOMEN, WOMEN OF COLOR, IMMIGRANTS, TOO OFTEN UNDERPAID, UNDER SEEN, UNDERVALUED. THAT IS WHY MY PLAN WILL ELEVATE THE COMPENSATION FOR CAREGIVERS AND WE WILL TRIPLE THE FUNDING FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS LIKE THE ONE BEHIND ME. WE WILL MAKE FOUR YEARS OF PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE AND UNIVERSITY TUITION FREE FOR ANY FAMILY THAT MAKES LESS THAN $125,000 A YEAR. WE WILL MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE FOR AMERICA'S IT QUALIFY. AND IF YOU ARE BUYING YOUR FIRST HOME, WE WILL PROVIDE A 15 THOUSAND DOLLARS TAX CREDIT TO HELP YOU GET THERE. WE WILL INCREASE BENEFITS FOR MILLIONS OF SENIORS. GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM. WE PAY FOR ALL THIS AND WE GROW THE ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CAN ONLY SEE THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. HE THINKS WALL STREET BUILT THIS COUNTRY. I SEE THE WORLD FROM SCRANTON. COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES YOU LIVE IN. THE MEASURE OF ECONOMIC ACCESS IS FAMILIES TALKING ABOUT THIS AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE, BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND THEY, HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. HOW MANY TIMES HAS SOMEONE , I KNOW THIS TIRES ARE BALD. WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE WE CAN CONTINUE TO BORROW FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THOSE ARE THE DISCUSSIONS THAT TOOK PLACE AROUND MY TABLE. IF WERE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, WE'VE GOT TO COME TOGETHER . I MADE A SPEECH AND I THOUGHT REALLY HARD ABOUT IT IN GETTYSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA AT THE BATTLEFIELD LAST WEEK. I SAID AT THE TIME WE ARE FACING A CRISIS NOT UNLIKE WE DID OVER GETTYSBURG. I SAID I AM RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT, BUT I AM GOING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I AM GOING TO WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. AFTER ALL THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH, AFTER ALL THE YEARS WE STOOD AS A BEACON OF LIGHT TO THE WORLD WE CANNOT BE HERE AND NOW AND 2020, WE CANNOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE TO PERISH FROM THIS EARTH. FOLKS, WE HAVE IT IN OUR HANDS AND I MEAN THIS , WE HAVE THE ULTIMATE POWER. WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE POWER IN A DEMOCRACY? THE POWER TO VOTE. IN NEVADA, THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS VOTE EARLY AND RETURN YOUR BALLOT QUICKLY. BALLOTS IN CLARK COUNTY WERE MAILED TWO DAYS AGO. YOU CAN RETURN YOUR BALLOT BY MAIL. YOU CAN DROP IT OFF WITH A DROPBOX. JUST MAKE A PLAN. SERIOUSLY. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM\/NV. MAKE A PLAN. MAKE SURE YOUR VOICE IS HEARD. WE CAN BE BETTER WE CAN BE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN BRING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER AGAIN WITH HIM GONE. FOLKS, LET ME CONCLUDE BY SAYING OR HAS NEVER EVER, EVER BEEN ANYTHING THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHEN WE HAVE DONE IT TOGETHER. NEVER, NEVER. FOLKS, LET'S STAND UP AND TAKE BACK THIS COUNTRY NOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO CORRECT THE MYTH THAT UKRAINE WAS THE PERPETRATOR HERE. I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AS A DEMOCRACY IS THAT FOR YOU ARE ABLE TO DEFEND YOUR ELECTION, THE FACTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH 2016. BY THE ORDERS OF VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIA INTERFERED IN THE 2016 ELECTION IN ORDER TO HELP DONALD TRUMP AND A SOW DISCORD WITHIN THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. RUSSIA SPREAD PROPAGANDA AND SOCIAL MEDIA. IT REACHED OVER 100 MILLION AMERICANS ONLINE. RUSSIA MILITARY INTELLIGENCE HACKED EMAILS. RUSSIA MILITARY INTELLIGENCE. , GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS RICK, AND I AM A THIRD-GENERATION FARMER RIGHT HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. BACK IN 2016, I VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FOUR YEARS AGO. HE MADE TONS OF PROMISES, THE WORKING MAN TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. AS HE TRAVELED AROUND THE COUNTRY, HE PROMISED TO BRING BACK JOBS AND PROMOTE THE ECONOMY. IT DID NOT TAKE LONG FOR ME TO REALIZE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOTHING MORE THAN A CON MAN. HE SO BE AND OTHERS ON THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD CHANGE THINGS IN WASHINGTON. YOU HEARD IT, DRAIN THE SWAMP. PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF, WHO FELT IGNORED AND UNDERAPPRECIATED BY OUR NATIONAL LEADERS. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT HE DID THE HAD AN IMPACT ON THOUSANDS OF FARMERS LIKE MYSELF, WAS THE START OF THE TRADE WAR WITH CHINA. IT WAS A DOUBLE WHAMMY. DUE TO THE TARIFFS COMPOUNDED WITH THE EFFECTS OF WHAT CHINA PUT ON WITH THE PRICES. SOYBEANS WAS THE MOST TALKED ABOUT IN THE PRESS. THIS ADDED UP TO A 40% EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY ON MY FARM. TRUMP HAS HEARD OF FARMERS BEING TRUE PATRIOTS. HE BOUGHT US OFF. THE POLICIES HAVE CAUSED FROM IT IS HARD FOR THE FARMING COMMUNITIES AND FARMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BECAUSE I'M A PATRIOT, I'M LOUDLY SPEAKING OUT AGAINST TRUMP AND HIS OF INITIATION. WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME WHY I NO LONGER SUPPORT, I TELL THEM THAT THE LIST IS TOO LONG. THE UNNECESSARY TRADE ISSUES WERE JUST THE START AND JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. THE TRADE WAR AFFECTED EVERY PERSON IN AMERICA, WHETHER THEY KNEW IT ARE NOT. HIS THREATS TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IMPACT MILLIONS. HIS PUSH TO ELIMINATE PAYROLL TAXES, AND FUNDING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. PEOPLE NEED THAT SAFETY NET THE MOST. DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON HIS TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THE CONSTITUTION, THE VALUES THAT HAVE HELD THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER FOR CENTURIES. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN AN AD IN WHICH I HELD PRESIDENT TRUMP FEDERALLY ACCOUNTABLE AND NEGLIGENT TO HOW HE MISINFORMED THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE PANDEMIC. THAT AD WAS MADE THREE WEEKS PRIOR TO BEING AIRED. WHEN IT WAS AIRED, IT WAS AIRED ON THE SAME DAY AS PAUL WOODRUFF'S BOOK. WHEN WE HEARD HOW SERIOUS TRUMP NEW THE VIRUS WAS. AND CHOOSING NOT TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I FELT SO VINDICATED BY MAKING THAT AD WHEN I HEARD THAT RECORDING. THIS GUY CLAIMS TO BE PRO-LIFE3 BUT HIS NEGLIGENCE HAS HELPED TO LEAD MORE THAN 10,000 PEOPLE TO AN EARLY DEATH DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS. HE HAS PUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES AT RISK FOR NOTHING MORE THAN PURE PROFIT OF WALL STREET. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT PRO-LIFE, HE IS PRO-PROFIT. OUR LIVES AND ONE IS HAVE BEEN NOTHING MORE THAN A GAME TO HIM. WE DESERVE SO MUCH MORE OUT OF A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. WHY AM I SUPPORTING AND SPEAKING OUT IN FAVOR OF VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN? IT IS PRETTY SIMPLE. WHEN I LISTEN TO JOE, I THINK OF MY KIDS AND GRANDKIDS. I THINK OF THE FUTURE THAT I WANT FOR THEM. THE AMERICA THAT I WANT THEM TO INHERIT. I KNOW THAT WHEN JOE BIDEN BECOMES PRESIDENT, HE WILL WORK HARD TO PUT A COUNTRY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. HE WILL MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED AND SET THE NEXT GENERATION UP WITH THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO THRIVE. HE WILL BE A LEADER THAT WE CAN TRUST AND BELIEVE. HE WILL BE ONE THAT WILL WHO WILL FIGHT FOR OUR CHILDREN AS IF THEY WERE HIS OWN. THAT IS WHY I AM HONORED AND PROUD TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] (music) [NO AUDIO] [APPLAUSE] HELLO. HELLO. HELLO. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IT IS GOOD TO BACK HERE IN ERIE. I WOULD TO SAY HELLO TO ALL OF ERIE. TO ALL LOCAL ELECTED LEADERS HERE ARE JOINING US HERE. AND TO YOUR NEXT SENATOR, WE NEED TO TURN OUT AND SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATS DOWN THE LINE. FOLKS, LOOK. I WENT TO THINK , I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. FOR EVERYONE AT THE UA FOR HOSTING THIS INCREDIBLE TRAINING FACILITY. I AM SO THINK TO OF EARNED THE ENDORSEMENT OF UA. YOU HAVE PROUD PLUMBERS AND MORE BEHIND ME THAN I COULD POSSIBLY THANK YOU FOUR. I WANT TO THANK RICK FOR SHARING HIS STORY AND BEING A PART OF A CONVERSATION THIS YEAR, HE SHARED HIS STORY WITH AMERICA. RICK, DELAWARE IS THOUGHT OF AS BEING A GREAT CORPORATE ENTITY AND CHEMICAL FACILITIES AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS, BUT WE HAVE A $4 BILLION AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. A LOT OF FARMERS ARE BEING HURT REALLY BADLY. FARMERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE BEING GUIDED BY THE PRESIDENT-ELECT WAS PROMISES. OUR FARMERS AND UNION MEMBERS WHO DO AN HONEST DAYS WORK, SEE THE PRESIDENT FOR HIS PROMISES AND WHAT THEY ARE. THANK YOU, RICK, FOR YOUR OP ED THAT YOU WROTE LAST YEAR. A BUNCH OF HOT AIR AND COLD WIND. FOLKS, THIS IS IT. THE ELECTION IS HERE. THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE MORE STARK, AND THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER. AFTER MY DEBATE IN CLEVELAND LAST, I TOOK A TRAIN. I HAVE WRITTEN A LOT. , I HAVE RATED IT A LOT. I HEARD THE SAME STORY, EVERYWHERE AROUND THE COUNTRY. YOU ARE TRYING YOUR BEST, BUT IT NEVER FEELS LIKE ENOUGH. YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, YOU ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A FAIR SHOT. THAT IS HOW MY DAD FELT WHEN WE HAD TO LEAVE SCRANTON. HE WAS IN SALES, HE WAS NOT IN THE COAL MINES. THEY TELL ME THAT MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS THE FIRST ELECTED IN THE STATE SENATOR , OUR MEMBER SAYING THAT HE MADE THAT WALK THE A LOT OF YOU KNOW HERE IN ERIE. TO TELL HIS KIDS THAT WE CANNOT PLAY AND THAT LITTLE LEAGUE BALL GAME ANYMORE. WE HAVE TO LEAVE, DAD DOES NOT HAVE A JOB. I REMEMBER HIM TAKING US HOME, MY MOM AND THE THREE CHILDREN AT THE TIME, HOME TO MY GRAND POPS. HOW MUCH PRIDE IT MUST HAVE COST HIM. HE STARTED COMMUTING EVERY WEEKEND, 157 MILES DOWN IN DELAWARE WHERE HE HAD GROWN UP. WE END UP IN CLAREMONT DELAWARE AND WENT TO WILMINGTON WHERE MY DAD GOT A SALES JOB. IT TOOK ABOUT FOUR YEARS TO BUILD A DECENT MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD A HOME. IT WAS NOT EASY FOR HIM. HE HAD AN EXPRESSION. HE SAID JOEY, I DO NOT EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS. BUT AT LEAST UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNMENT TO UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW IS FOR THE PRESIDENT TO EXACERBATE THE PROBLEMS. MORE THAN 10,000 ARE DEAD. WE LOSE ANYWHERE FROM 700 TO 1000 PEOPLE DEBT. , PEOPLE DEAD. WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS TOLD THAT A THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERY DAY, HE SAID IT IS WHAT IT IS. THAT IS BECAUSE HE IS WHO HE IS. 175 CASES , 175,000 CASES RIGHT HERE PENNSYLVANIA. WHEN YOU LOSE A CHILD AND LOOK AT THE EMPTY CHAIR AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE AT NIGHT. MY HEART GOES OUT TO EVERYONE STRUGGLING AND THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS. SIMPLE NEGLECT ON THE PART AT THIS ADMINISTRATION. MANY JOBS HAVE NOT COME BACK. TEMPORARY LAYOFFS HAVE TURNED INTO PERMANENT LAYOFFS. WE ARE STILL DOWN ON THE MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE THE CRISIS STARTED. MORE THAN 40,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENCY SINCE HOOVER THAT IS GOING TO END UP LEAVING OFFICE THAN WITH FEWER JOBS THAN HE STARTED OFFICE. THIS IS CALLED A K-SHAPED RECOVERY. EVERYBODY IN THE MIDDLE AND BELOW, IT IS GOING DOWN. THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE. ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE SACRIFICED TO KEEP US GOING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND BY THE MOST PEOPLE RECOVERY IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THIS IS A STARTLING FACT TO MEET. , TO ME. THE TOP 100 BILLIONAIRES IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC MADE 300 BILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. 100 INDIVIDUALS MADE $300 BILLION THIS YEAR. THE BOTTOM HALF GOT THIS SLIDE DOWN. THIS PRESIDENT CAN ONLY SEE THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. I SEE IT FROM SCRANTON AND CLAREMONT, FROM REAL , FOR R EAL. I SEE IT FROM ERIE. MY PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON THE WORKING PEOPLE. THE ABOUT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW WHO GOT UP THIS MORNING AND HAD THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION. HOWDY, I KNOW THAT WE NEED FOUR NEW TIRES, BUT WE CANNOT DO IT RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE TO WAIT. I KNOW WE JUST LOST OUR INSURANCE, BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE OK. WE ARE GOING TO HANG IN THERE. OR, HAVING TO MAKE A CHOICE, LITERALLY A CHOICE BETWEEN GETTING A PRESCRIPTION OR PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. IF I SAID THAT 10 YEARS AGO, YOU WOULD LOOK AT ME LIKE I WAS WRITING A FICTION STORY. BUT THAT IS THE TRUTH. THOSE ARE THE DECISIONS THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING TODAY AND RIGHT NOW. INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS PUT OUT BY HIGHLY RESPECTED WALL STREET FIRM, PROJECTS THAT MY BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN IS GOING TO CREATED 80.6 MILLION JOBS IN FOUR YEARS , 18.6 MILLION. I DOUBLE CREATES 7 MILLION MORE JOBS THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. HERE IS HOW IT WORKS. I AM NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON ANYBODY MAKING LESS THAN $40,000. , $400,000. FOR THOSE MAKING MORE THAN THAT, I WILL ASK THE WEALTHY TO BEGIN TO PAY. 91 OF THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES TODAY PAY ZERO DOLLARS TAX. HOW MANY OF YOU PAY ZERO TAX? BILLIONAIRES ARE PAYING A TAX-FREE AS INVESTMENT MONEY, A LOWER TAX RATES THEN IF YOU HAVE A JOB AS A PLUMBER. HOW CAN THAT BE? THE MONEY THAT I AM GOING TO RAISE IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE AND GROW THE CLASS BACK , GROW THE MIDDLE CLASS BACK. TO GET IT BACK TO FULL EMPLOYMENT FAST AND HELPLESS BUILD BACK BETTER THAN BEFORE. WE ARE GOING TO CREATED MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. THE PRESIDENT TURNS TO ME, IN THAT STATE OF UNION ADDRESSES, AND HE SAID THAT SHERIFF JOE IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF AND HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. WE GO BACK THE LONGEST EXPANSION IN AMERICAN HISTORY. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY, MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A FUTURE MADE IN AMERICA. UPGRADING THE WATER AND PIPES, MAKING SURE THAT IT IS SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT. BILL AND LAY DOWN BY UNION PLUMBERS AND PIPE FEEDERS HERE. WE ARE GOING TO UPGRADE 4 MILLION BUILDINGS WITH WEATHERIZATION OF 2 MILLION HOMES. THIS WILL. ONE MILLION GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. LOOK FOLKS, WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BILL BACK BETTER , BUILD BACK BETTER. HE PROMISES INTRA-FRACTURE PLANTS. HE DID NOT DO ANYTHING. HE PROMISED TO RELIEVE MAIN STREET SLAMMED BY THE RECESSION. GUESS WHERE THAT MONEY WENT THAT THE CONGRESS PASSED? A WENT TO THE WEALTHY. , IT WENT TO THE WEALTHY, AND IT DID NOT GO TO SMALL BUSINESSES. MY PLAN TO REVITALIZE INFRASTRUCTURE IS TO BUY IN AMERICA. WE ARE GOING TO RAISE OVER $3.7 TRILLION BY ELIMINATING THE TAX CUT FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY. WE WILL FIX WATER PIPELINES AND UPGRADE LED PLANTS. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD $100 BILLION FOR OUR SCHOOLS. 4 MILLION BUILDINGS. ADVANCED HEATING AND COOLING SYSTEM. THERE WILL BE A RACE FOR JOB CREATION FOR UNIONS, YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE IT. WHAT I DID THE RECOVERY ACT, $800 BILLION. NOT ONE SINGLE SOLITARY DOLLAR WENT TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PREVAILING WAGE. [APPLAUSE] I AM ALSO GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT CORPORATE AMERICA WANTED TO TAKE CARE , TAKEOVER RESIDENCY A PURCHASE SHIPS , APPRENTICESHIPS. I'M GOING TO PASS THE PROACTIVE , PO-ACT. STRENGTHEN LABOR STANDARDS, THE OSHA RULES. THERE IS A LOT THAT WE CAN DO, BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO. WORKERS. HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET BENEFITED. MY DAD HAD ANOTHER EXPRESSION. AFTER HE LOST HIS JOB, AND WE MOVED TO DELAWARE. HE SAID JOEY, A JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR GET IN THE EYE AND SAY, HONEY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. EVERY TIME THAT WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, DONALD TRUMP SAYS HOAX. I THINK JOBS. NO MATTER HOW MANY LIES HE TELLS, I'M NOT BANNING FRACKING. PERIOD. [APPLAUSE] I SAID INSIDE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE OF POWER'S WITH POWER. THE ONLY POWER THAT WE HAVE IS UNION POWER. YOU ARE THE GUYS THEY KEEP THE BARBARIANS ON THE OTHER CITED AT THE GATE FROM TAKING EVERYTHING. THAT IS A FACT. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE MIDDLE-CLASS PERSON FEARING THE MOST? THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO TEAR DOWN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON IT. WE WILL HAVE A NOT-FOR-PROFIT PUBLIC INSURANCE OPTION. WE WILL INCREASE SUBSIDIES, AND PREMIUMS WILL BE LOWER. WE WILL HAVE PLANS WITH LOWER DEDUCTIBLES AND LOWER OUT OF COSTS EXPENSES. WE WOULD DO THAT WITH THE MONEY THAT WE TAKE BACK FROM THE SUPER WEALTHY. WE WILL TAKE ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, WITH PLANS THAT WILL , WE WILL WORK WITH STATES TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO FREE, HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL. NOT DAYCARE, BUT PRESCHOOL. THE MATTER WHAT THE BACKGROUND, IF YOU START THEM AT AGE THREE, THEY HAVE A 50% CHANCE OF GRADUATING THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND BEYOND, NO MATTER THE BACKGROUND. TALK TO THE WOMEN AROUND HERE. I WAS A SINGLE DAD FOR FIVE YEARS. I COULD NOT AFFORD HELP. THANK GOD THAT HAD MY SISTER AND MOM AND BROTHER TO HELP WITH MY KIDS, WHEN MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KILLED. WHEN ERIE GETS ITS FIRST COMMUNITY COLLEGE OPENED, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS FREE FOR ANYONE WHO QUALIFIES TO GET IN. THAT IS A FACT. [APPLAUSE] THAT COST $6 BILLION A YEAR. THAT IS ABOUT AS MUCH AS WE GIVE AS A TAX REDUCTION FOR RACEHORSES. LOOK AT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF SCHOOL SINCE THE 9\/11 GENERATION. THEY GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE, NO GRADUATIONS. THEY ALL GOT SHUT DOWN IN THE GREAT RECESSION AND NOW. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? THEY ARE UNABLE TO MAKE THAT FIRST HOME DOWN PAYMENT. A LOT OF THEM ARE COLLEGE GRADUATES, AND THERE IS NO JOBS, NO ACCESS. I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WILL GET A TAX CREDIT FOR YOUR FIRST TIME HOME BUYING, PROVIDING A DOWN PAYMENT. WE WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND INCREASE BENEFITS FOR MANY OF SENIORS, SO YOU CAN RETIRE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. WE WILL HAVE TO VOTE, LIKE WE HAVE NEVER VOTED BEFORE. EARLY VOTING IS OPEN HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. GO TO EARLY VOTING IF YOU CAN. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM\/PA TO FIND OUT WHERE YOU CAN VOTE AND WAKE ABOUT EARLY. MAKE SURE THAT YOU SEAL THE MAIL-IN BALLOT AND A SECRECY ENVELOPE AND SIGNED THE DECLARATION ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE ENVELOPE BEFORE YOU RETURN IT. I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT I AM GOING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I'M GOING TO WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. I AM SO PROUD IN THIS CAMPAIGN TO EARN THE SUPPORT OF SONY PROUD, PATRIOTIC REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING THE HOMELAND SECURITY TOM RIDGE. WE AGREE ON THIS. THIS IS A MOMENT FOR COUNTRY ABOVE PARTY. AFTER ALL THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH, AND AFTER ALL THAT AMERICA HAS ACCOMPLISHED, IT CANNOT BE THAT HERE, IN THE YEAR 2020, THAT WE WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE, TO PARISH ON THIS EARTH, AS LINCOLN SAID. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALL OF THIS DIVISION BEING PUSHED BY THIS PRESIDENT. ALL OF THIS ENCOURAGED. IN THE DEBATE THAT WE HAD, I ASKED HIM TO CONDEMN THE PROUD BOYS? HE SAID TO STAND DOWN AND STAND READY. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY, FOR REAL. WE CAN ARGUE LIKE HELL, THAT THE END OF THE DAY, WE COME TOGETHER. I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES THAN I'VE EVER BEEN. WHY? THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF. I THINK THAT WE CAN PULL THIS TOGETHER. I AM OPTIMISTIC. I'D GENUINELY AM. YET TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GO OUT AND VOTE. THE ONLY WAY THAT WE LOSE THIS IS BY WHAT IS GOING ON RELATIVE TO THE POLLING PLACES. NOT EIGHT SINGLE SOLITARY REASONABLE PERSON SAID THAT MAIL-IN BALLOTS ARE CORRECT. HE IS TRYING TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE THAT. TRY TO PUT PEOPLE IN POLLING PLACES, THE SAME GUYS THAT YOU SAW BLOCKING PEOPLE'S WAY IN VIRGINIA WITH BANNERS AND RACIAL SLUR ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. SO I SAY TO YOU ALL, GOD BLESS YOU ALL. LET'S GO OUT AND VOTE, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] WHERE MY GOING? AM I GOING THIS WAY? THANKS EVERYBODY. THANKS A MILLION. THANK YOU! [APPLAUSE] (music) U.S. ARMY.

IN OHIO, WE NEVER QUIT REEDIT JOE, WE'VE SEEN THROUGH A LOT OF TIMES BUT WE KEEP FIGHTING. WHEN I WAS LAID OFF FROM GENERAL MOTORS POWERTRAIN IN 2009 , LOCAL BUSINESSES WERE LEFT STAGNANT .

[MUSIC] HELLO TOLEDO . [APPLAUSE] THIS FEEL LIKE COMING HOME . I TELL YOU WHAT, MY DAD WAS OIL MAN AND I GOT THROUGH SCHOOL AND WE GOT THROUGH BEING ABLE TO LEAD AFTER WE LOST A JOB UP IN PENNSYLVANIA, HE HAD TO MOVE DOWN TO DELAWARE BECAUSE MY COUSIN WAS SELLING GENERAL MOTORS PRODUCTS SO IN MY STATE USED TO HAVE THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF AUTOWORKERS OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION BECAUSE WE HAD A SMALL POPULATION AND THE LARGEST GENERAL MOTORS AND LARGEST CHRYSLER PLANT OUTSIDE OF MICHIGAN AND OHIO . AND I SAW WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE GOT HIT VERY HARD. WE LOST BOTH THOSE PLANTS. AND WHEN I STARTED OFF BY SAYING MISTER MAYOR, THANKS FOR SUPPORTING YOUR CITY AND MARCY, YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND A LONG TIME, THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTRODUCTION . THERE'S NO MORE FIERCE DEFENDER OF THE PEOPLE SHE GREW UP WITH BEN MARCY. SHE HAS NEVER , EVER FORGOTTEN WHERE SHE CAME FROM. SHE'S TOUGH , SHE'S A STRAIGHT SHOOTER . SHE'S INFLUENTIAL IN CONGRESS. SHE'S HONEST AND SHE SEES YOU. YOU'RE ALWAYS IN HER VIEW. AND TONY , MISTER PRESIDENT, I KNOW YOU'RE NEW AND HE SAID PIECE OF CAKE SO I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY , HE GOT ELECTED THE FIRST HUNDRED DAYS BUT ALL KIDDING ASIDE, TONY THANK YOU FOR HOSTING US AND THANK YOU TO LOCAL 14 . THANKS FOR THAT INTRODUCTION . FOR ALL YOU DID FOR BARACK AND ME WHEN WE WERE RUNNING , WHEN WE GOT ELECTED, JUMPING IN AND HELPING US STUBBORN . YOU REMIND ME OF SOMETHING MY DAD SAID . HE SAID JOE, A JOB IS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN JUST A PAYCHECK . IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT . IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SAVE YOUR KIDS EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY AND MEAN IT . THAT'S WHAT A JOB IS ABOUT . DECENT PAYING JOBS LIKE THE UAW PROVIDES . THIS I GREW UP WITH SURROUNDED BY HARD-WORKING FAMILIES IN SCRANTON AND DELAWARE WHERE HE HAD TO MOVE WHEN MY DAD LOST WORK, THERE WAS NO WORK IN SCRANTON AREA JUST LIKE HERE IN TOLEDO . BUT TIMES ARE HARD , UNEMPLOYMENT IS WAY UP DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND THE TERRIBLE WAY IN WHICH IT'S BEEN HANDLED . THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK REMAINS UNCERTAIN . ACROSS OHIO AND THE COUNTRY , FOLKS ARE WORRYING ABOUT MAKING THE NEXT MORTGAGE PAYMENT FOR THE RENT PAYMENT . WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN PURCHASE A PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR BE ABLE TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE , LITERALLY. WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER A KIDS SCHOOL IS OPEN AND BEING ABLE TO STAY OPEN AND IF THEY'RE NOT OPEN , HOW THEY CAN GO TO WORK IF THEY HAVE A JOB AND STILL TAKE CARE OF THEIR KIDS . THEY SEE THE PEOPLE AT THE VERY TOP DOING BETTER THAN THEY EVER HAVE . WHILE THERE LEFT TO WONDER WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR ME ? THAT'S DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY . 215,000 DEAD BECAUSE OF COVID. EXPERTS SAY WE'RE LIKELY TO LOSE ANOTHER 200,000 PEOPLE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS UNLESS WE TAKE SERIOUS ACTION AND HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING . ALL BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENTS ONLY WORRIED ABOUT ONE THING . THE STOCK MARKET , REFUSING TO FOLLOW THE SCIENCE , IT'S ESTIMATED IF WE JUST WORE THESE MASKS , WE SAVE OVER 100,000 LIVES AS WE NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR . AS PRESIDENT KNEW BACK IN JANUARY HE WAS BRIEF AND DETAILED BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HOW EXTREMELY DANGEROUS THIS VIRUS WAS. HOW COMMUNICABLE THAT THE DISEASE WAS . HE WANTED TO TAKE AN INTERVIEW WITH BOB WOODWARD TELLING WHAT WERE YOU HOW DANGEROUS THE DISEASE WAS BUT DID NOTHING . ASK YOURSELF , WHY DIDN'T HE TELL US ? WHY DIDN'T HE WARN US ? HE SAID NOTHING REEDIT HE TOLD WOODWARD HE DIDN'T WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . THAT'S WHY HE SAID NOTHING. WE DON'T PANIC . AMERICA DOESN'T PANIC BUT TRUMP HAD REARED HIS RECKLESS PERSONAL CONDUCT SINCE HIS DIAGNOSIS HAS BEEN UNCONSCIONABLE . THE LONGER DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT , THE MORE RECKLESS HE SEEMS TO GET . DOCTOR FAUCI, HE TOLD THE PRESIDENT ON HIS ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE ROSE GARDEN, HE REFERRED TO THAT AS A SUPER SPREADER. ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT GOT THE DISEASE , HOW IS HE RESPONDING WEST AND MARK GET WHAT GUESS WHAT, HE'S RUNNING AN AD YOU PROBABLY SAW . QUOTING DOCTOR FAUCI OUT OF CONTEXT, WAY BACK IN MARCH REFERRING TO PUBLIC OFFICIAL , DOCTOR FAUCI SAID I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY COULD BE DOING MORE .IN THE RECENT AD THAT'S GOING OUT NATIONALLY , TRUMP QUOTES DOCTOR FAUCI AS SAYING THAT ABOUT HIM, THE PRESIDENT READ TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN LIGHT TAKING IT SOUND LIKE FAUCI WAS TALKING ABOUT TRUMP. HE WENT ON AIR AND THE ACTING OUT SAYING THREE DAYS AGO, I DID NOT GIVE PERMISSION FOR THAT QUOTES . IT WASN'T REFERRING TO THE PRESIDENT . AND EVEN AFTER THAT , FAUCI SAID HE DIDN'T SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT AND THE CAMPAIGN, EVEN AFTER FAUCI LAID THIS OUT THE CAMPAIGN SAID WE ARE STILL GOING TO USE IT BECAUSE HE DID SAY . EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T ABOUT . THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS IT WAS A KNOWING LIVE LIKE WE ARE BEING TOLD ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS . AS A CONSEQUENCE, HIS MONTHS OF IRRESPONSIBLE ACTION , HOW MANY EMPTY CHAIRS WERE AROUND YOUR BREAKFAST TABLE THIS MORNING ? SOMEONE YOU LOVE , SOMEONE YOU CARED ABOUT . SOMEONE YOU KNEW, A FAMILY MEMBER OR A NEIGHBOR . MISSING, AND WHY? BECAUSE OF NEGLIGENCE . LOOK, I DO THIS CAMPAIGN AS I'VE SAID BEFORE AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN BETWEEN SCRANTON AND PARK AVENUE, BETWEEN ALITO AND PARK AVENUE AREA ALSO CAN SEE IS FROM PARK AVENUE IS WALL STREET . THAT'S WHY HIS ONLY MESSAGE FOR AMERICAN PROSPERITY THAT HE VALUES HIS IN DOW JONES AND INDEX . LIKE A LOT OF YOU , I'VE SPENT A LOT OF MY TIME WITH GUYS LIKE TRUMP LOOKING DOWN ON ME . THE IRISH CATHOLIC KID IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD . GUYS WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE BETTER THAN ME BECAUSE THEY HAD A LOT OF MONEY . GUYS WHO INHERITED EVERYTHING THEY EVER GOT AND STILL MANAGED TO SQUANDER IT . I HAVE TO ADMIT , I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ON ON RECORD SAYING , I STILL HAVE A BIT OF A CHIP ON MY SHOULDER ABOUT GUYS LIKE HIM . I READ SOME STORIES AFTER I GOT THE NOMINATION THAT QUOTES, BIDEN GETS ELECTED , YOU'LL BE THE FIRST NON-IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL GRADUATE TO GET ELECTED IN 80 OR 90 YEARS . HAVE A SEAT MAN . LIKE SOME STATE , I'M PROUD OF IT, IT'S HARD TO GET THROUGH IN TERMS OF MONEY BUT FULL, SINCE WHEN CAN SOMEONE WHO WENT TO A STATE UNIVERSITY NOT BE QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT ? FOLKS, I KNOW IT TAKES TO BE PRESIDENT . I SAT BACK FOR EIGHT YEARS WATCHING AND PARTICIPATING . MY MOM TAUGHT ME THAT WHAT YOU ARE PROBABLY TAUGHT BY YOUR PARENTS TOO. HE SAID JOEY, NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU . BUT EVERYBODY IS YOUR EQUAL . I DON'T MEASURE PEOPLE BASED ON THE SIZE OF THEIR BANK ACCOUNT . I DON'T RESPECT PEOPLE BASED ON WHETHER THEY OWN A MANSION . I DON'T JUDGE THEM WHETHER THERE BASED ON WHETHER THEY BELONG TO A COUNTRY CLUB . YOU WANT TO MEASURE BY PEOPLE BY THE STRENGTH OF THEIR CHARACTER, THEIR HONESTY , THEIR COURAGE . THEIR COURAGE FOR MOMMIES TO SAY THE GREATEST KIDS OF ALL , THE GREATEST VIRTUE IS COURAGE . YOU'RE REDEEMED BY YOUR COURAGE . THAT'S WHAT SHE'D SAY , AND REDEEMED BY YOUR LOYALTY . HONESTY, LOYALTY, THINGS THAT ARE BIGGER THAN YOURSELF . THOSE ARE THE NEIGHBORHOODS WE WERE RAISED IN IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY . DECENCY, HONOR, OPPORTUNITY THESE ARE THE VALUES I LEARNED GROWING UP IN SCRANTON AND MY GUESS IS YOU LEARNED GROWING UP IN TOLEDO WHEREVER YOU GREW UP PEOPLE I GREW UP WITH IN SCRANTON DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY OR STOCK AND EVERY PENNY MY DAD MADE WENT TO PAY THE BILLS , KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. EVERY PENNY OUR FRIENDS IN SCRANTON MADE WENT TO PAYING THE BILLS AND TAKING CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL AND WE LOOKED OUT FOR OUR NEIGHBORS . THAT'S WHY I HAVE A DIFFERENT MEASURE BY WHICH I JUDGE THE HEALTH OF AMERICA'S ECONOMY . I SEE HARD WORK , HARD-WORKING WOMEN AND MEN TRYING TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILY , JUST WANT EVEN SHOT . THEY'RE JUST ASKING FOR A FAIR SHOT . AND YOU KNOW, GIVEN A SHOT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL NEVER EVER LET THEIR COUNTRIES DOWN. NEVER. ANOTHER EXPRESSION MY DAD WOULD HAVE IS WHEN YOU SEE THE ABUSE OF POWER , THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO RESPOND TO IT AND THAT'S WITH POWER . AND THE ONLY POWER WE HAVE TO TAKE ON CORPORATE AMERICA IS UNION POWER . THAT'S THE ONLY POWER . I CAN THINK BACK TO 2008 WHEN BARACK AND I WERE ELECTED AND WE HAD THE WORST DEPRESSION IN HISTORY, PRESIDENT OF PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE RECOVERY ACT . $800 BILLION WAS NEEDED TO SAVE OUR ECONOMY. WE GET IT WITH LESS THAN 2\/10 OF ONE PERCENT WASTE OR FRAUD . WE WERE ABLE TO SEE A HIGHWAY OTHER STATES RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE TO ADDRESS THEIR ECONOMIC PAIN AND RECOVER AND REBUILD . TO MAKE SURE WE GET TEACHERS , FIREFIGHTERS AND COPS , PUBLIC NURSES ON THE JOB. PEOPLE WERE BEING LAID OFF NOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT . SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE FIRED BECAUSE OF LACK OF MONEY. WAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STEPPED UP AND STARTED LONGEST SUSTAINED ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN AMERICAN HISTORY . AT THIS GUY INHERITED AND THEN SQUANDERED AGAIN . BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL SAID RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE STATES . HE SAID QUOTE, LET THEM GO BANKRUPT . I HEARD THAT BEFORE , YOU HEARD IT TOO. THE REPUBLICANS SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT THE AUTO INDUSTRY . LIKE I SAID, I COME FROM AN AUTOMOBILE STATE . THE AUTO INDUSTRY SUPPORTED 108 HIGHLANDS , WAS ON THE BRINK . WAS MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO BUT YOU REMEMBER LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. IT WAS ON THE BRINK. BARACK AND I BET ON YOU THE AMERICAN WORKER AND IT PAID OFF . ARGUED AN AMERICAN WORKER WAS NOT FINEST WORKER IN THE WORLD READ MANAGEMENT SCREWED UP, YOU DIDN'T . YOU DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE AND BY THE WAY , IT'S ALL GOT PAID BACK BUT GUESS YOU MADE THE GREATEST SACRIFICE ? AUTO WORKERS. YOU MADE THE SACRIFICES TO GET IT BACK . SO IT'S OVER THE MANY OBJECTIONS OF MANY WHO STEPPED IN , RUSHED IN TO SAVE THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY. GENERAL MOTORS AND CHRYSLER GAVE 1 MILLION JOBS AND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN DONALD TRUMP TOOK OFFICE ? REMEMBER WHAT TRUMP SAID IN 2017? HE SAID DON'T MOVE, DON'T SELL YOUR HOUSE . IT'S SHUT DOWN THE ON SLOT AFTER A DECADE IN CLEVELAND , I MET WITH AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER IN LORDSTOWN, HER HUSBAND WAS THERE AS WELL . ONE OF THE WORKERS LOST HIS JOB . HE HAD TO ACCEPT THE TRANSFER TO KENTUCKY EIGHT HOURS AWAY , ONE WAY TO CHANGE HEALTHCARE IN HIS PENSION. HE'S GONE 16 HOURS A WEEKEND . TO SEE HER AND THE TWO KIDS TRUMPS THE TRAIL DOESN'T STOP THERE. HE BETRAYED UNION WORKERS AT GOODYEAR WHEN HE CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT OF BUYING GOODYEAR TIRES BECAUSE OF A PERSONAL GRUDGE . HE PASSED THE TAX BILL TO THE SUPER WEALTHY CORPORATIONS THAT PROVIDED INCENTIVES FOR COMPANIES THAT MOVE JOBS OVERSEAS . FOLKS, MANUFACTURING IS THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA . WHERE IN A MANUFACTURING RECESSION BECAUSE OF DONALD TRUMP EVEN BEFORE THE VIRUS DID YOU WERE DOWN 647,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS NATIONWIDE BECAUSE THE CRISIS STARTED . OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS MEANING WE'RE SENDING MORE OVERSEAS AND COMING TO US , ANYWHERE BUYING MORE OVERSEAS AND WE'RE SELLING AND IT'S HIGHER THAN IT'S BEEN IN A LONG TIME. THERE'S STILL NINE, 10,900 AUTO WORKER MANUFACTURING JOBS IN OHIO THAT HAVE NOT COME BACK. THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT HERBERT HOOVER 90 YEARS AGO , THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF MODERN HISTORY TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS AND HE HAD WHEN HE CAME TO OFFICE . DONALD TRUMP'S ONLY PLAN IS MORE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY . MOST OF YOU IF YOU STILL HAVE A JOB PAID MORE LAST YEAR IN TAXES, $750 , COME ON. THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED . WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT . $30 MILLION , A NEW PROPOSAL . FOR THE GAMES OF THE HUNDRED RICHEST BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA , 30 BILLION . THEY MADE $30 BILLION . ALONE. THIS YEAR. WHILE THE REST OF THE PEOPLE ARE GETTING KILLED . IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC , WHY DO REPUBLICANS HAVE TIME TO HOLD A HEARING ON THE SUPREME COURT PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC NEED FOR LOCALITIES? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. IT'S ABOUT FINALLY GETTING HIS WISH TO WIPE OUT THE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE ACT . BECAUSE THEIR NOMINEE SAID IN THE PAST THE LAW SHOULD BE STRUCK DOWN . HIS RELATIVES EFFORT TO ELIMINATE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PROVIDED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR 20 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE . SECTIONS FOR WELL OVER 100 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND YOU KNOW, WE'VE SEEN HIS PLEDGE TO TERMINATE THE TAX DEDICATED TO FINANCING SOCIAL SECURITY . DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUARIES OF SOCIAL SECURITY THE PART OF SAID? IF IT GOES THROUGH , TAXIS TALKING ABOUT WILL ACTUALLY BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BY THE MIDDLE OF 2023 . GO HOME AND TELL YOUR PARENTS THAT . NOT ONCE AS PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED FOR A HIGH-LEVEL MEETING BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE WHITE HOUSE . THIS IS GOING ON NOW. THE HOUSE HAD ALREADY PASSED TAX IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER HIS POSITION TO BE ABLE TO RECONCILE PEOPLE IN REAL TROUBLE. GET HELP TO STATES LIKE WE DID . NOT ONCE CALLED A MEETING BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS . TO DELIVER THE NEW RELIEF PACKAGE OR WORKING FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES GOING BANKRUPT . HE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME IN THE BUNKER OF HIS GOLF COURSE OR IN THE BUNKER OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND HE WAS WILLING TO ACTUALLY SIT TO TRY TO WORK SOMETHING OUT. CHECK IT OUT . FIRST PRESIDENT I CAN EVER REMEMBER IN THE MIDDLE OF A NATIONAL ECONOMIC CRISIS DID NOT TRY TO CALL THE PARTIES TOGETHER . HE TURNED HIS BACK ON YOU AND I PROMISE YOU I WILL NEVER DO THAT . [APPLAUSE] FOLKS , THAT'S WHY MY BILL BACK BETTER PLAN IS BUILT AROUND A SIMPLE CONCEPT . IT'S TIME TO REWARD WORK , NOT WEALTH . WORK. I NEED IT. AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS BY A BIG WALL STREET FIRM CALLED MUTED MOVIES , NOT DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK, THEY DID AN ANALYSIS OF MY ECONOMIC PLAN TO REVIVE THIS COUNTRY . AN ANALYSIS OF HIS. WHAT THEY CONCLUDED . MY PLAN WOULD CREATE 18.6 MILLION JOBS IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS . 7 MILLION MORE AND THE PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC PLAN IT WOULD GENERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF AN ADDITIONAL TRILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. WHAT THESE GUYS DON'T GET IS YOU DO WELL, WHEN MY FAMILY GOES WELL , EVERYBODY DOES BETTER . EVERYBODY DOES BETTER . THAT'S THE GOD'S TRUTH . HERE'S HOW MY PLAN WORKS. I'M NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON ANYONE WHO MAKES LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR . IF YOU MAKE MORE THAN 400 YARD BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GET A TAX RACE AREA IF YOU'RE MAKING OVER 400 . BUT LOOK, YOU PAY A PENNY MORE. IN FACT, TENS OF MILLIONS OF MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WILL GET A TAX CUT WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST . IF WE JUST RAISE THE TAX BACK TO WHAT IT SHOULD BE 20% THAT GENERATES OVER $100 BILLION. YOU HEAR ME? THAT IS MONEY. IT SHOULD BE $1.3 TRILLION AND THAT IS WHAT IT RAISES TO HELP HARD-WORKING FOLKS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE AND GROW THE MIDDLE CLASS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE COMES ALONG THIS TIME. MY PLAN WILL CREATE 1 MILLION GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS, MANUFACTURING AND BUILDING PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT WE NEEDED NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. YOU'RE NOT INVESTING IN RESEARCH RESEARCH. IT STARTS WITH A PRETTY BASIC IDEA. YOU KNOW, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EVERY YEAR SPENT $600 BILLION JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SHIPS AND PLANES, CARS AND TRAINS AND ALL THE THINGS THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONTRACTS FOR. I PROMISE YOU THIS, EVERY SINGLE PRODUCT, EVERY SINGLE CONTRACT WILL BE ONLY LET TO A COMPANY OR FIRM THAT MAKES IT IN AMERICA FROM BEGINNING TO END, NOT A JOKE. IT WILL USE TO BUY AMERICAN PRODUCTS, SUPPORT AMERICAN JOBS AND INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE, ROADS, BRIDGES AND 1.5 MILLION NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS, HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND IN EVERY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD, MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. WE WILL REBUILD CRUMBLING SCHOOLS, RETROFIT FORMALLY IN BUILDINGS AND WEATHERIZE 2 MILLION HOMES CREATING 1 MILLION NEW JOBS AND THE REASON WHY EVERYONE FROM THE ELECTIVE WORKS IN EVERY MAJOR STRONG SUPPORT AND IT WILL ALL BE DONE BY CERTIFIED UNION LABOR LABOR. YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN THE PRESIDENT PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE $800 BILLION, NOT ONE SINGLE CONTRACT WHEN OUT THAT WASN'T PREVAILING WAGE, NOT ONE. [HONKING & CHEERING] SO WE WILL END TRUMPS NEW INCENTIVE FOR SENDING JOBS ABROAD AND THAT IS WHAT HE HAS DONE, MORE JOBS GOING ABROAD NOW. ANY COMPANY THAT WILL OFFSHORE A JOB WILL 10% PENALTY. ANY COMPANY THAT BRINGS BACK A JOB WILL REOPEN TO CLOSE FACTORIES LIKE A MANUFACTURING THEY WILL GET A 10% CREDIT FOR THEIR INVESTMENT. WE WILL MAKE A TRADE TO FIGHT FOR EVERY AMERICAN WORKER EVERY AMERICAN JOB AND ACTUALLY GET RESULTS. NOT TRUMPS TRADE WAR, ERRATIC TWEETS AND BLUSTER BUT IT IS ONLY STIFFED AMERICAN WORKERS AND CONSUMERS, INCLUDING FARMERS FARMERS. HE HAS LET YOU DOWN. HE HAS LET US DOWN. I PROMISE YOU I WILL STAND UP TO CHINA'S TRADE ABUSES I WILL INVEST IN THE AMERICAN WORKER BECAUSE I KNOW NO ONE, NOBODY CANNOT COMPETE IN AMERICAN WORKER WHEN THEY GOTTEN A FAIR SHOT. NOBODY IN THE WORLD. ONE MORE THING, UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OWNS AND MAINTAINS AN AND NORMA'S FLEET OF VEHICLES BUT WE WILL CONVERT MANY OF THEM TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND YOU WILL STILL NEED TO BUILD THE TRANSMISSIONS FOR A LONG TIME TO COME BUT ANY NEW JOB IN THAT AREA WILL GO TO PEOPLE WHO IN THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY ARE WHO IN THE MANUFACTURING AND UAW WILL MAKE THESE NEW VEHICLES. SOURCE RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA HEARD THE GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE AND DEMAND SUPPORT TO RETOOL FACTORIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO COMPETE IN THE U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY WILL STEP UP AND I WILL EXPAND CAPACITY SO THE UNITED STATES, NOT CHINA, LEADS THE WORLD IN MODERN NEW TECHNOLOGY. WE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR AMERICA CONSUMERS TO MOVE TO THE VEHICLES OF THE FUTURE. BY BUILDING A NETWORK OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHARGING STATIONS AND TO SWAP OLDER FUEL-EFFICIENT CARS AND WE WILL MOVE IN A DIRECTION THAT HIS TECHNOLOGY IS TAKING US AND MAKE SURE UAW LEADS THE WAY AND HOW WE DO IT. TOGETHER THIS WILL MEAN 1 MILLION GOOD NEW JOBS IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY. FOLKS, IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN DO ANYTHING AND I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DO IN THE NEXT FOUR, SIX YEARS, EIGHT YEARS THAN ANYTHING THAN ANY TIME IN MY WHOLE CAREER. THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THEY'VE SEEN WHAT THE COMBINATION OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THE RACIAL INEQUALITY WE ARE FACING AND WHAT IS GOING ON INTERNATIONALLY WE ARE READY TO STEP UP AND THEY KNOW WE HAVE TO CHANGE. NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING IS BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND I MEAN THAT. THINK ABOUT IT. WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT HAS COME OUT OF EVERY CRISIS STRONGER THAN WE WOULD BECAUSE OF WHO WE ARE. AS I SAID TO OTHER WORLD LEADERS NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THERE IS NO QUIT IN AMERICA. THERE IS NONE. IN AMERICA WE CAN DO ANYTHING THAT WE NEED TO DO IF WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER, NOTHING CAN STOP US. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AND THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING PRETTY AND RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT FOR THE SENATE WHEN IRAN AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT FOR VICE PRESIDENT AND RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT FOR PRESIDENT. I PROMISE YOU THIS, I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL GOVERN FOR EVERYONE WHO VOTED FOR ME AS WELL AS AGAINST ME. WE CAN BE BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. WE CAN BEAT WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST. [HONKING & CHEERING] THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SO VOTE, VOTE AND VISIT OHIO .COM. GOD LETS YOU AND GOD BLESS THE AUTOWORKERS. WHICH WAY AM I GOING? [HONKING & CHEERING] MY GRANDFATHER WOULD SAY JOEY, KEEP THE FAITH AND MY GRANDFATHER SAID JOEY, NO SPREAD IT. GO SPREAD THE FAITH. LET'S WIN THIS THING.

THANK YOU FOR THAT PASSPORT INTO THE CITY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP WORKING FOR YOU I CANNOT SEEM IN THE LIGHT. THANK YOU MR. MAYOR IN THE MAYOR IS A VERY GOOD FRIEND WITH A HELLO ONE OF THE MOST DECENT MEN I KNOW WHO OCCUPIES MY SEAT IN THE UNITED STATE SENATE WE WERE TRUMAN SCHOLARS TOGETHER YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT I APPRECIATE IT. KATE YOU ARE SOMETHING ELSE. THERE IS AN OLD JOKE A LONG TIME AGO A SENATOR SAID TO ME WHEN I WAS MUCH YOUNGER AND MY SECOND TERM HE SAID JOE, I WILL COME TO DELAWARE AND CAMPAIGN FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOU WHENEVER WHOLESALE LANDERS BUT DID NOT HURT YOU BUT ALL KIDDING ASIDE KATE, WE NEED YOU IN U.S. CONGRESS AND THEY MEAN THAT. THE REASON I SAY THAT YOU ARE HEALTHCARE ADVOCATE AND A CANCER SURVIVOR, MOM, AND WE NEED LEADERS LIKE YOU REPRESENTING PEOPLE IN THE FIRST DISTRICT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON EVERY DAY. IN THE DISCUSSIONS TAKING PLACE AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE IN THE MORNING WHEN FAMILY STILL TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION, JOYCE. BEFORE I BEGIN LET ME SAY I AM SADDENED TO HEAR ONE OF MY BASEBALL HEROES, JOE MORGAN, A GOOD MAN PASSED AWAY. MY CONDOLENCES TO THE MORGAN FAMILY AND HIS TEAMMATES. HE PLAYED ONE YEAR AT THE PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES. I WILL GET MYSELF IN TROUBLE BUT I HAPPEN TO GREW UP IN A HOUSEHOLD IN SCRANTON PENNSYLVANIA WHERE HE WANTED TO HAVE DINNER YOU HAD TO BE A YANKEES FAN BECAUSE OF THE AAA BALLCLUB AND MY GRANDPA WAS AN ALL-AMERICAN AND A GREAT YANKEES FAN. IT WAS HARD BACK THEN BUT IN DELAWARE IF YOU ARE NOT A PHILLIES THE END WE PUT IT THIS WAY, IF I WERE NOT A PHILLIES FAN I WOULD BE SLEEPING ALONE. [LAUGHTER] YOU THINK I'M KIDDING. I AM NOT. BURGER PLAYED FOR A YEAR IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY. HE WAS THE VOICE AS ONE OF THE GREAT BASEBALL ANNOUNCERS IN HISTORY . . . . CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE AND ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN OHIO. I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THAT YOU WIN OHIO YOU ARE THE STARTING GATE AND AGAIN I SPENT A LOT OF TIME AS I WAS TELLING THE MAYOR WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED TO THE SENATE I WAS 29 IN WASHINGTON AND I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A FIRST RESPONDER SAYING MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER HAD JUST BEEN KILLED AND MY TWO BOYS WERE BADLY INJURED AND THEY WERE NOT SURE IF I'D MAKE IT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TOOK ABOUT THREE HOURS AND THE JAWS OF LIFE TO GET MY KIDS OUT OF THE CAR BECAUSE THEY WERE BROADSIDED BY A TRACTOR-TRAILER. MY SISTER MANAGED MY CAMPAIGN MY YOUNGER SISTER AND MUCH YOUNGER BROTHER RAISED ALL THE MONEY WE RAISED, $187,000. WE WENT TO OUR GOVERNOR TO DETERMINE WHO THEY WOULD PICK IN MY SPOT BECAUSE I DIDN'T PLAN ON GOING. A LOT OF REALLY FINE MEN WHO IN THE SENATE AT THE TIME AND REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS CAME TO ME AND SAID HE'S COMING TO STAY FOR SIX MONTHS AND HELP US ORGANIZE. I STARTED COMMUTING EVERY DAY BACK AND FORTH. THAT'S HOW I GOT INVOLVED BECAUSE WHEN THEY PUBLISHED THAT, THEY KEEP RECORDS ON HOW MANY MILES YOU TRAVEL. AND I TRAVELED OVER A MILLION 4,000 MILES. I USED TO LIKE TO TAKE THE TRAIN HOME BECAUSE IT COST A LOT OF MONEY BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT, IT FELT MUCH MORE SECURE BUT THEY HUMORED ME AND LET ME GO HOME. I REMEMBERED GETTING ON THE TRAIN AND I GOT TO KNOW THEIR FAMILY. THEY SAID I JUST READ JOEY. BIG DEAL. WENT TO NEW JERSEY AND YOU KNOW HOW MANY MILES YOU TRAVEL ON AMTRAK, NO I DON'T. HE SAID WE FIGURE 117 HERE AND THE NEXT NUMBER OF DAYS YOU TRAVEL TO MILLION 100,000 ON AMTRAK. I THINK I HOLD A RECORD OTHER THAN A CONDUCTOR. MY POINT IS WE WILL END UP MOVING HIGH-SPEED RAIL IN A WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE BEFORE AND THE REASON I WENT HOME IS THE SAME REASON YOU ALL TRY TO AND THAT IS TO BE THERE IN THE EVENING WHEN MY KIDS WENT TO BED IN THE MORNING, MY SON, AND MY DAUGHTER ASHLEY, GET THEM BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING ON THE WAY TO THE STATION AND THEN AS THEY GOT OLDER IT WASN'T THE CASE, BUT KISS THEM GOOD NIGHT. I KNOW DAD, WE'VE GOT TO SAY THREE HAIL MARYS. IT'S ONE WAY THAT I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE PRESS THAT TRAVEL WITH ME FOR REPEATING IT, BUT USUALLY I COULD GET THE 7:00 ON THE FAST TRAIN. YOU GET OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY EXIT AND I WONDER LITERALLY SITTING THERE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW WHAT WERE THOSE PARENTS TALKING ABOUT AT THAT DINING ROOM TABLE, WHAT WERE THEY DOING BEFORE THEY PUT THEIR KIDS TO BED. MY GUESS IS THEY TALK ABOUT THE SAME THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT TODAY. THEY ARE ASKING QUESTIONS AS PROFOUND AS ORDINARY. ARE WE GOING TO BE OKAY. ARE WE GOING TO MAKE IT AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO. WHO'S GOING TO TELL HER WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO GO BACK TO THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR YOU'VE GOT TO DRIVE ANOTHER THOUSAND MILES WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO GET NEW TIRES. IT'S ABOUT ANSWERING THOSE KIND OF QUESTIONS. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. HE WASN'T A COALMINER BUT MY GREATGREAT-GRANDFATHER WAS A MINING ENGINEER. MY DAD USED TO SAY THE JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY AND RESPECT AND YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY AND BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KIDS IN THE EYE AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY AND MEAN IT. THAT IS A LESSON THAT I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN AND IT'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH IN SCRANTON PENNSYLVANIA WHEN MY DAD TOOK US TO DELAWARE BUT WE FINALLY GOT TOGETHER AGAIN AND THAT IS THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD IN SCRANTON LIKE HERE IN CINCINNATI. UNEMPLOYMENT IS UP AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK REMAINS VERY CERTAIN AND MISHANDLED. ACROSS OHIO IN THIS COUNTRY FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING THEIR NEXT RENT OR MORTGAGE PAYMENT OR WHETHER THEY WILL BE OUT IN THE STREET. WHETHER THEY CAN PURCHASE THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUG THEY NEED OR HOW MUCH FOOD THEY CAN PUT ON THE TABLE. MAKING HARD CHOICES WORRYING ABOUT WHAT SCHOOL A CHILD IS ENROLLED IN IS GOING TO BE OPEN. WHAT DO THEY DO IF I GO TO WORK, WHO'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEM, HOW DO WE DO THAT? THEY SEE THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP DOING BETTER AND BETTER EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THIS RECESSION. YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHO IS LOOKING OUT FOR ME. THAT'S DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. 215,000 PEOPLE DEAD. EXPERTS ARE TELLING US WE MAY LOSE UP TO ANOTHER 200,000 LIVES BY THE END OF JANUARY ALL BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS ONLY WORRIED ABOUT ONE THING, THE STOCK MARKET. IT'S ESTIMATED IF WE JUST WORE MASKS, THE ONE I JUST TOOK OFF TO SPEAK THE EXPERTS SAY WE COULD SAVE BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR 100,000 LIVES. THE PRESIDENT KNEW BACK IN JANUARY I THINK IT WAS THE 28TH OF JANUARY WHEN THE COMMITTEE KEPT TELLING US HOW SERIOUS THE PANDEMIC WOULD BE, HE KNEW THAT IT WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND AN EXTREMELY COMMUNICABLE DISEASE, AIRBORNE, BUT HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. BUT OUT OF HIS DESIRE TO TRY TO GET BOB WOODWARD TO WRITE SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT HIM HE DID A LONG INTERVIEW WITH THEM AND HE WENT ON RECORD SAYING HE KNEW HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS, BUT HE DID AND SAID NOTHING EXCEPT PRAISING THE GREAT PERFORMANCE AND HOW TRANSPARENT HE WAS. ASK YOURSELF WHY DID HE NOT TELL THE COUNTRY OR HOW BETTER OFF WOULD HE BE HAD HE TOLD THE COUNTRY. HE SAID NOTHING. HE TOLD BOB WOODWARD HE DIDN'T WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. AMERICANS DON'T PANIC. HE HAS BEEN UNCONSCIONABLE. THE LONGER HE'S PRESIDENT, THE MORE RECKLESS HE GETS. DOCTOR FAUCI, THE MOST RESPECTED PERSON IN THIS AREA, IN THE COUNTRY REFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE SUPREME COURT IN THE ROSE GARDEN AS A SUPER SPREADER EVENT PUBLICLY CRITICIZING YOU AND HOW IS HE RESPONDING, HE IS RUNNING A NATIONAL AS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY QUOTING HIM OUT OF CONTEXT. DOCTOR FAUCI SAID BACK IN MARCH REFERRING TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS, QUOTE, I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY COULD BE DOING MORE, REFERRING TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. BUT TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN WERE USED TO DECEPTION AND NOT TELLING THE TRUTH AND TOLD A LIE BY PUTTING FAUCI IN THE AD IN PLYING HE WAS TALKING ABOUT TRUMP SAYING HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW ANYBODY COULD DO ANY BETTER. AFTER FAUCI SAW THE AD HE WENT PUBLIC. HE CAME AFTER THAT AND SAID I DIDN'T GIVE PERMISSION AND IT WAS NOT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. EVEN AFTER HE SAID THAT. AND I LISTEN TO YOUR TALK. EVEN AFTER HE SAID THAT, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. THEY CONTINUED TO LIE AND SAID WE ARE KEEPING IT IN THE AD. THE SAME THAT SAYS I'M GOING TO INCREASE TAXES ON MIDDLE-CLASS FOLKS AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF CREDIBILITY. LOOK, THEY USE IT KNOWING THAT IT'S A LIE. CAN YOU REMEMBER ANY OTHER MAJOR MAINSTREAM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS? AS A CONSEQUENCE OF MONTHS OF OVERWHELMING LYING AND MISLEADING AND IRRESPONSIBLE ACTION, ON THE PART OF DONALD TRUMP, HOW MANY EMPTY CHAIRS ARE GOING TO BE AROUND THE DINNER TABLE TONIGHT BECAUSE OF THEIR NEGLIGENCE, HOW MANY? HOW MANY BROTHERS, SISTERS, MOMS, DADS ARE GONE? WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS DESPITE THE CRISIS WE FACE, WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY. WE ALWAYS COME OUT OF THE CRISIS STRONGER. THAT'S THE UNIQUENESS OF WHO WE ARE. WE NOW HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD BACK AND GIVE EVERYBODY A FAIR RETURN ON THEIR WORK AND BEGIN TO REWARD WORK AND NOT JUST WEALTH. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR THE COMMITTEE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE BREAK THE CYCLE WILL. THE ANSWER IS JUSTICE. I KNOW THE NATION IS STRONG ENOUGH TO PROVIDE SAFE STREETS FOR THE FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES AND TOO OFTEN TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF LOOTING AND BURNING WHICH IS NEVER JUSTIFIED. WE HAVE NO NEED FOR THE ARMED MILITIA ROAMING THE STREETS. WE SHOULD HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR EXTREMIST WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS MANAGING THE COMMUNITIES. READING WHAT IS HAPPENING IN MICHIGAN, THE GOVERNOR IS A GOOD FRIEND. THEY ARE IN THE DRIVEWAY WITH ASSAULT WEAPONS. WHAT ABOUT THOSE GUYS YOU TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME LACKS HE SAID I WOULD TELL THEM TO STAND BACK AND STAND BY. I WORKED IN THE COMMITTEE IN DELAWARE AND THAT IS CALLED A DOG WHISTLE. THEY SAY WE SHOULD TRUST THE AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITIES THROUGH THEIR JOB AS I DO AND LET THEM DO THEIR JOB WITHOUT THE GROUPS ACTING AS VIGILANTES. THEY SAY WE HAVE NO NEED TO FACE RACIAL INJUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU HAVEN'T OPENED YOUR EYES TO WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY AND HAS FOR A LONG TIME. I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I DECIDED TO RUN WHEN I SAW THOSE FOLKS MARCHING OUT OF THE FIELDS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. THIS IS WHY WE ELECTED HIM AND ASK THE PRESIDENT WHAT DO YOU THINK HE AND HE SAID SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID. MARK IT DOWN. THERE'VE BEEN A VERY POWERFUL VOICES IN THE RECENT WEEKS AND MONTHS. I'VE SPENT SOME TIME. I KNELT DOWN TO SAY HI TO HER AND SHE SAID IN A SOFT VOICE DADDY CHANGED THE WORLD. ALSO GOT TO KNOW JACOB'S MOM AND THE WHOLE FAMILY. VIOLENCE DIDN'T REFLECT HER SON AND THE NATION NEEDED HEALING. ONE OF THE THINGS I FOUND PRETTY MOVING CHOKING BACK TEARS REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, QUOTE, WE ARE THE ONES GETTING KILLED. WE ARE THE ONES GETTING SHOT. IT'S AMAZING WHY WE KEEP LOVING THIS COUNTRY IF THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T LOVE US BACK. THINK ABOUT THAT. THERE'S A DEEP LOVE FOR THIS COUNTRY AND FOR TOO LONG HAVE NEVER BEEN FULLY RECOGNIZED. SOME TALK ABOUT THE LACK OF. WE'VE NEVER MET THAT STANDARD. MOVING CLOSER AND CLOSER. IT WAS TURNED BACK IN A BIG WAY. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I THINK WE NEED THE LEADERSHIP TO DE-ESCALATE TENSION AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER TO HEAL AND HOPE. THAT IS A PRESIDENTS JOB. IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO COMPETE AND BUILD WEALTH. IT'S ABOUT JOBS, GOOD PAYING JOBS, FINANCIAL STABILITY, FAMILIES OF COLOR BUILDING WEALTH, BEING ABLE TO PASS IT DOWN LIKE MY IRISH CATHOLIC FOLKS WERE ABLE TO DO AND BUILD HOME-EQUITY. FOR EXAMPLE, ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS, MORE AND MORE WOMEN ARE DROPPING OUT OF THE WORKFORCE IN THIS RECESSION WHETHER IN THE CITY OR THE SUBURBS. TESTING, TRACING, NOT POLITICIZING THE RACE FOR A VACCINE WITH SAFE AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION PROVIDING FUNDING FOR PPE, PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND OTHER RESOURCES AND FOR SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES TO REOPEN SAFELY. IF YOU NOTICE THE PRESIDENT SAID WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS RESPONSIBILITY HE SAID I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY. THAT IS A QUOTE. I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY. NO NATIONAL STANDARD HAS BEEN SET BY THIS ADMINISTRATION. WE HAVE TO DO SO MUCH AND WE CAN DO SO MUCH. FOR SO MANY FAMILIES EXPERIENCING IT BETWEEN RAISING YOUR KIDS WHILE CARING FOR AND AGING LOVED ONE. IT'S REAL. PROTECT YOUR HEALTHCARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC. WHY DO SO MANY REPUBLICANS TODAY HAVE TIME TO HOLD A HEARING ON THE SUPREME COURT WITH 22 DAYS LEFT TO GO. THINK ABOUT THAT. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS $145 BILLION UP TO THE STATES AND LOCALITIES SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO LAY OFF COPS, FIREFIGHTERS, SCHOOL TEACHERS, NURSES, FIRST RESPONDERS. I WILL TELL YOU WHY THEY ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IT'S ALL ABOUT WIPING OUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS BEEN AN OBSESSION SINCE HE BECAME PRESIDENT. THE NOMINEES SAID IN THE PAST THE LAW SHOULD BE STRUCK DOWN. THAT'S GOING TO TAKE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE AWAY FROM 20 MILLION AMERICANS BECAUSE OF HIS MISHANDLING OF THE ECONOMY AND COVID, 10 MILLION HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR EMPLOYER-BASED INSURANCE. IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWAY PRE-EXISTING COVERAGE FOR 100 PLUS MILLION AMERICANS AND COMPLICATIONS TO COVID-19 LIKE LUNG SCARRING AND HEART DAMAGE COULD PUT HOW MANY MILLIONS IF THERE'S ALREADY SO MANY CONTRACTING COVID IN THE UNITED STATES. WHAT HAPPENS THEN, IT CANNOT BE COVERED. IT'S GOING TO TAKE US BACKWARDS WHERE THEY CAN CHARGE A WOMAN MORE FOR THE SAME TREATMENT THAT THEY CHARGE A MAN. PREGNANCY ONCE AGAIN BECOMES A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. WE COULD DO SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. TOGETHER WE CAN BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WITH A NEW HEALTH INSURANCE OPTION. A NONPROFIT PUBLIC OPTION WHICH IS GIVING A REAL COMPETITOR AND INCREASE THE SUBSIDIES SO PREMIUMS ARE LOWER AND YOU CAN AFFORD PLANS AND LOWER DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS. WE CAN ONLY DO ANY OF THIS IF THE COUNTRY COMES TOGETHER. LAST WEEK, WENT TO GETTYSBURG PENNSYLVANIA WHERE ABRAHAM LINCOLN TOLD US A HOUSE DIVIDED CANNOT STAND. TODAY HOPE SEEMS ELUSIVE. THE POLICIES ARE RIPPING US APART. AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE WILLING TO COOPERATE AND GET PUNISHED BY THIS PRESIDENT. I REFUSE TO LET THAT HAPPEN. WE NEED TO REVIVE THE SPIRIT OF BIPARTISAN. THAT IS WHERE WE ARE. STILL BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. I SAY THAT AND I SAID THAT FROM THE TIME I ANNOUNCED. YOU'VE GOT A LOT DONE BEFORE, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WE CAN, AND WE MUST IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE. I'MI AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] THERE WILL BE NO BLUE STATES AND RED STATES. IT'S ONE AMERICA. I WILL WORK WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. IT'S HARD FOR THOSE WHO VOTE AGAINST ME AND THOSE THAT VOTED FOR ME. THAT'S THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT, THE ABILITY TO CARE, TO CARE FOR EVERYBODY. WE CAN DISAGREE ON POLICY, BUT STILL CARE. YOU HAVE A SACRED DUTY, A SACRED OBLIGATION TO VOTE. IT MATTERS. OHIO MATTERS. YOU ELECTED ME AND I'M ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN 2020. I PROMISE TO ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK. SO PLEASE, VOTE. GO TO I WILL VOTE TO REQUEST YOUR ABSENTEE BALLOT AND VOTE BY MAIL TO CONFIRM YOUR EARLY VOTING LOCATIONS TO VOTE EARLY IN PERSON AND FIND YOUR POLLING PLACE. JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A PLAN. BRING ALONG FAMILY AND FRIENDS. MAKE THEIR PLAN TO VOTE AS WELL. NO MATTER WHAT, DON'T LET ANYBODY DISCOURAGE YOU AND TELL YOU THAT YOUR VOICE WILL NOT BE COUNTED. IT DOES. DON'T BE INTIMIDATED BY THE TALK OF HAVING SOME OF THESE PROUD BOYS STAND THERE WITH THEIR RIFLES TO TRY TO OPEN CARRY AND INTIMIDATE PEOPLE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING. YOU DECIDE OUR FUTURE. VOTE AND TURN OUT IN LARGE NUMBERS. I SAID I WAS RUNNING TO RESTORE AMERICA. IT'S TIME TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. THIS TIME, BRINGING EVERYBODY ALONG. NO MATTER YOUR RACE, AGE, GENDER, DISABILITY, EVERYBODY GETS TO COME ALONG. IT'S TIME TO UNITE AMERICA. WE WILL DO THAT BY CHOOSING HOPE OVER FEAR, SCIENCE OVER FICTION, TRUTH OVER LIES AND UNITY OVER DIVISION. THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF THE NATION WHEN WE STAND TOGETHER. SO IT'S TIME TO STAND UP, TAKE BACK OUR DEMOCRACY, UNITE, AND LET'S FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A WHILE REFLECT THE VALUES OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICA. MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS. ..

YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE PUBLISHED THIS PIECE OF IT MID-SEPTEMBER, RHOMBUS IS KEPT, TRUMP'S CLAIMS A MONUMENTAL STEP STILL AT IT. ALSO THIS TWEET FROM THE PRESIDENT YESTERDAY. REPUBLICANS WILL BE PROVIDING FAR BETTER HEALTHCARE THAN THE DEMOCRAT COME DEMOCRATS AT FAR LOWER COST AND WILL ALWAYS PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. JULIE ROVNER, WHAT WE NOTE THAT ANY POTENTIAL REPUBLICAN OR WHITE HOUSE LED HEALTHCARE PLAN? Guest: NOT VERY MUCH. THE PRESIDENT DID FINALLY HAVE A BIG AND FAILING. HE MADE SPEECH IN NORTH CAROLINA OF HIS AMERICAN HEALTHCARE PLAN , (music) (music) (music) (music) BRING ME YOUR HIGHER LOVE (music) (music) GOOD AFTERNOON, BROWARD COUNTY. WELCOME TO THE CALL SECTOR SOUTH WAS FOCAL POINT SENIOR CENTER HERE IN PEMBROKE PINES. MY FRIENDS, I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR TWO YEARS TO BE ABLE TO WELCOME SOMEONE WHO I KNOW WILL BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] I SAY 32 YEARS BECAUSE WE BACK WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA I WAS A MEMBER OF STUDENTS FOR BIDEN IN 1988 AND WHERE MY BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT BUTTON ON MY BACKPACK ALL OVER CAMPUS. AND SO THE THRILL AND OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US TODAY HERE IN PEMBROKE PINES AND WELCOME OUR NEXT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN TO OUR DISTRICT AND OUR COMMUNITY HERE IN SOUTH FLORIDA IS JUST ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. BECAUSE THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION ARE SO HIGH FOR ALL OF US. BUT FOR OUR SENIORS IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY, , HEALTH, SAFETY AND SURVIVAL. WE HAVE WITNESSED AN EPIC FAILURE BY DONALD TRUMP TO CONFRONT AND MANAGE THIS PANDEMIC. JUST LOOK AT OUR LIVES RIGHT NOW. LOOK AT THAT GATHERING WE ARE IN MIDST OF. GRANDPARENTS CAN'T SAFELY SEE OR HUG YOUR KIDS OR THE GRANDKIDS. WE'VE HAD MORE THAN 15,000 NEEDLESS FUNERALS HERE IN FLORIDA. FUNERALS WHICH BY THE WAY WE CAN'T FULLY ATTEND AS FAMILIES BECAUSE THIS BY RACE ISN'T TRULY UNDER CONTROL. OUR ECONOMY WHICH IS SO TIED TO TRAVEL AND LEISURE IS BEING RAVAGED. AND FROM THE BEGINNING TRUMP HAS FAILED TO TAKE SERIOUSLY LEAVING A RECORD OF DEATH, DECEIT AND THE NILE IN HIS WAKE. HE LEFT SENIORS TO INFER THEMSELVES WITH NO PLAN TO CONTAIN THIS DEADLY VIRUS. EVEN WHEN CHUCK MANAGES TO RESPOND TO THIS CRISIS HE PUT SENIORS IN MORE DANGER. ABOUT ONE IN THREE FLORIDIANS RELY ON THAT ABOUT ONE IN THREE OLDER FLORIDIANS RELY ON SOCIAL SECURITY AS THE SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME, AND OVER 4.5 MILLION COUNT ON MEDICARE. YET DONALD TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS THREATEN THE SURVIVAL AND STABILITY OF THESE CRITICAL PROGRAMS. MAKE NO MISTAKE, NEITHER OF THESE MEN WALKED INTO THE WHITE HOUSE WITHOUT THE BLESSINGS OF FLORIDA SENIORS. AM I RIGHT? YES, THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. [APPLAUSE] MUCH IS MADE IN THE RISE OF THE YOUTHFUL AND THANK GOD FOR IT BUT IT IS RESIDENCE WHO ARE 65 AND OLDER WHO STILL MAKE ELECTIONS HERE IN THE SUNSHINE STATE. THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE TRAVELS THROUGH FLORIDA, AND ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF OUR SENIORS TURN OUT AT THE POLLS EVERY SINGLE ELECTION. SO WHILE TRUMP CLOSES DOWN THE GOVERNMENT SPENT THE NEXT GREAT FORCE, LIES TO AMERICANS ABOUT THE THREAT IT POSES OR PUSHES ANOTHER QUACK CURE, JOE BIDEN HAS A PLAN TO GET COVID-19 UNDER CONTROL. AND FOR THE LONG TIME SECURITY OF OUR SENIORS, JOE BIDEN HAS A PLAN THAT STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY COMPARED TO JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN SHOCKINGLY DONALD TRUMP MADE IT CLEAR HE WOULD SHRED THE FUNDING MECHANISM FOR THIS VITAL SAFETY NET FOR OUR SENIORS. YOU JUST CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP. THIS MAN WANTS TO TRY TO WIN FLORIDA AND HE WOULD SHRED THAT VITAL SAFETY NET. JOE BIDEN RIGHTLY SAYS THIS THIS IS A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. IN THAT BATTLE JOE BIDEN WILL NOT HAVE VITAL PROGRAMS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY TO FALL VICTIM TO THIS. IT IS A LIFE-SAVING PROGRAM FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICAN SENIOR CITIZENS. SO LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. JOE BIDEN WON'T SACRIFICE SOCIAL SECURITY OR THREATEN THE FUTURE OF MEDICARE. JOE BIDEN WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SCREW WITH ALL THE POLITICAL MUSCLE HE CAN MUSTER. THE INADEQUATE RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED A CRISIS IN OUR NURSING HOMES AND LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES. AS TRUMP CONTINUES TO SIT ON HIS HANDS, JOE BIDEN RELEASED A PLANNED INCREASE SAFETY AND OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY SO OUR LOVED ONES CAN BE CARED FOR WITH THE DIGNITY THAT THEY DESERVE. WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING MEDICARE AND LOWERING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS, YOU KNOW JOE BIDEN WILL GO TO BAT FOR FLORIDA SENIORS BECAUSE HE'S DONE ALL DISLIKED HER PROTECTING SENIORS ISN'T JUST SOME REALITY SHOW GIMMICK AND JOE BIDEN , THEN MOVED ON FROM THE NEXT DAY. PROTECTING SENIORS IS WHO JOE BIDEN IS. IT'S WHO HE'S ALWAYS BEEN. FROM THE VILLAGES IN CENTRAL FLORIDA TO SUNRISE LAKES AND KINGS POINT IN BROWARD COUNTY, IN THEIR HEART OF HEARTS OUR SENIORS KNOW THAT THEY CAN TRULY COUNT ON JOE BIDEN. THEY CAN, JOE BIDEN TO PROTECT SOURCES COULD BECOME PRESERVE MEDICARE AND MAKE THEIR MEDICATIONS LESS EXPENSIVE AND MORE AFFORDABLE. AND DEEP DOWN SENIORS KNOW THEY CAN COUNT ON JOE BIDEN TO TAKE OF THIS VIRUS IT SAFELY REUNITE THEM WITH THEIR FRIENDS, CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. FLORIDA SENIORS KNOW THEY HAVE A FRIEND AND ALLY IN JOE BIDEN BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS STOOD BY THEM AND EVEN IN A CRISIS LIKE THIS ONE HE WILL NEVER LEAVE THEIR SIDE. THAT TRUST WILL SHOW ITSELF ON ELECTION DAY. IT ALREADY IS. I JUST KNOW IT. 21 DAYS, MY MY FRIENDS. ON TO VICTORY FOR FLORIDA, , FOR FLORIDA SENIORS AND FOR ALL OF AMERICA. 90 SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] , THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) HELLO, MY NAME IS TOBY FOYER. I WAS BORN IN THE BRONX. I GREW UP IN NEW YORK CITY. I I GOT MARRIED AND HAD TO MAKE WONDERFUL CHILDREN. I WORKED 25 YEARS AT BROOKLYN COLLEGE IN ADMINISTRATION AND MOVED HERE TO BROWARD COUNTY IN 1998 TO ALLEGEDLY RETIRE. WELL, IT WASN'T MUCH, MUCH OF A RETIREMENT FOR ME. I IMMEDIATELY BECAME INVOLVED WITH MY CONDO ASSOCIATION OF MY LOCAL COMMUNITY, AND I SERVED EIGHT YEARS ON THE CITY COMMISSION. I LIKE TO CALL MYSELF A PROFESSIONAL VOLUNTEER. I WORK WITH FLORIDA AMERICA, THE WESTERN MUSIC SOCIETY, WESTERN FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY, AND THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN, TO NAME JUST A FEW. IN SHORT, I LIKE TO STAY BUSY. WE OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE SAY THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIMES, BUT FOR FLORIDA SENIORS, THIS REALLY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION WE WILL EVER VOTE IN. LIKE SO MANY SENIORS I PAID INTO SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND I PLANNED MY RETIREMENT AROUND THAT INCOME. BUT NOW DONALD TRUMP IS THREATENING TO DEFINED SOCIAL SECURITY. SOME OF MY NEIGHBORS DEPEND ON SOCIAL SECURITY , DEFINED , AS THEIR SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME. AND FOR A PRESIDENT TO BREAK HIS PROMISE TO US IS UNCONSCIONABLE, ESPECIALLY NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. BEFORE COVID-19 AND MY WEEKS WERE JAMMED WITH SO MANY THINGS, MEETINGS, SOCIAL GATHERINGS, TRIPS AND SO MUCH MORE, BUT THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED. COVID-19 HAS TURNED MY LIFE UPSIDE DOWN. MEETINGS ARE OVER ZOOM NOW AND I TRY TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH FRIENDS OVER THE PHONE, BUT IT IS SIMPLY NOT THE SAME. I AM INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE TO BE LIVING WITH MY DAUGHTER WHO WORKS FROM HOME, BUT I DON'T EVER LEAVE MY HOUSE AND LESS IT'S TO PURCHASE GROCERIES AND ESSENTIALS EVERY TWO WEEKS. THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS, I , IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. NONE OF US WANT TO LIVE OUR LIVES AT HOME IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER SCREEN. AND IF DONALD TRUMP HAD NOT LIE TO US AND HE HAD DECIDED TO TAKE THIS VIRUS SERIOUSLY, THINGS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FOR FLORIDA SENIORS. BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS WRITTEN SENIORS OFF AS EXPENDABLE. WELL, GUESS WHAT? WE ARE NOT AND WE WON'T. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A DISASTER FOR SENIORS. WE DESERVE BETTER. WE DESERVE A LEADER WHO CARES ABOUT US. I KNOW JOE BIDEN WILL LOOK AFTER US. I KNOW JOE WILL PROTECT AND STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY, AND I KNOW HE WILL ALWAYS , LOWER THE COURSE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND KNOW HE HAS A REAL PLAN TO BE COVID-19 SO THAT OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, WE COULD SEE THEM AGAIN. OUR KIDS, OUR GRANDKIDS, AND GET LIFE BACK TO NORMAL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. JOE BIDEN WILL ALWAYS FIGHT FOR SENIORS, AND THAT'S WHY I ENCOURAGE YOU AND ASK YOU TO PLEASE GET OUT TO VOTE EITHER BY MAIL OR IN PERSON FOR JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS THE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) HELLO, HELLO HELLO. GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL. PLEASE, PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEE IF YOU HAVE ONE. THANK YOU SO VERY, VERY MUCH. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK IN FLORIDA AND I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, CONGRESSWOMAN. SHE'S BEEN A TIRELESS , WHERE IS DEBBIE? THERE SHE IS. THANK YOU DEBBIE. YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND A LONG TIME AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE ENCOURAGEMENT. TOBY, I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU. TOBY MOVED FROM A HIGH RENT DISTRICT AND BROOKLYN COMES AT THE HIGHEST WITH DISTRICT IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW THESE DAYS. GOOD TO SEE YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT KIND INTRODUCTION. IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU TO HEAR THE STORIES COME TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THESE TOUGH TIMES, DIFFICULT TIMES. TODAY, TODAY'S STORY IS CERTAINLY ONE IN SOUTH FLORIDA. WE ARE ALL LIVING SOME VERSION OF IT RIGHT NOW WITH SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF OUR LIVES BEING PUT ON HOLD. THE SAME STORY BEING MOVED BY PEOPLE LIKE CARL WHO MANY OF YOU KNOW WELL. CARL IS HERE TODAY I'M TOLD. I DON'T KNOW , [INAUDIBLE] HEY, CARL. HOW WERE YOU, MAN? GOOD TO SEE HERE. LIGHT WAS SHINING LIGHT IN MY EYES LOOKING AT YOU, MAN. I APOLOGIZE. CARL IS 39 , NO, 93 WHEN HE ACTS LIKE HE'S 39 YEARS OLD. DOING SO MUCH IN THIS COMMITTEE, A FEW THANK YOU ALL DECIDED TO RENAME THIS COMMUNITY CENTER IN HIS HONOR. I'VE HEARD WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT YOU, , AND LOOK FORWARD TO SAY HELLO TO YOU PRIVATELY. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING CARL BACK IN 2012. HE MAY MAY NOT REMEMBER IT BUT HIS STORIES WITH HIS COMMUNITY AND THIS COUNTRY IS ALL ABOUT YOUR CARL IS A SIGN OF AN IMMIGRANT. CARL SERVED OUR NATION HONORABLY IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR, THAT IS SWEETHEART AND NEEDY, THE BEEN MARRIED NOW FOR 67 YEARS. TOGETHER THEY BUILT THE FAMILY, FOUR CHILDREN, SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN AND MORE THAN 30 YEARS THEY MADE THEIR HOME HERE, STAYING ENGAGED IN ALL THE LOCAL ISSUES. CATCHING SUNNY MATINEES AND PERFORMANCE AT THE ART CENTER AND THE CENTER, AND SOCIALIZING WITH NEIGHBORS AND TO JOIN NIGHTS IN THE TOWN AND A COUPLE TIMES, TO A THREE TIMES A WEEK GOING OUT. BUT THEIR STORY LIKE SO MANY OTHERS IS A A QUINTESSENTIAL AMERICAN STORY THESE DAYS. IT HAS BEEN INTERRUPTED THIS YEAR. CARL AND ANITA HAVE BEEN OUT I'M TOLD TO A IN SEVEN MONTHS AND THERE ARE NO MORE STANDING MATINEES OTHER THAN GETTING GROCERIES THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME IN THEIR APARTMENT LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE DO. IT'S HARDER THAN EVER TO SPEND TIME WITH THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE, OTHER THAN ON ZOOM OR ON A COMPUTER CONNECTION. WE HAVE ALL FELT THE SCENT OF INTERRUPTION IN OUR LIVES AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T NORMAL, THAT THINGS DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. WE LOOK AROUND AT OUR NEIGHBORS AND WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE HURTING. A LOT OF FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING THE NEXT RENT PAYMENT OR NEXT MORTGAGE PAYMENT. THEY ARE NOT ONLY, WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. WE SEALED OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE VERY TOP DOING BETTER THAN THEY HAVE EVER DONE, AND WONDER AN AWFUL LOT IS WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR ME? WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR ME? THAT'S BEEN THE STORY, THE ENTIRE STORY OF MY GIVE DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. THE FACT THAT HE HAS NEVER BEEN FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS. HE'S NEVER BEEN FOCUS ON YOU. HIS HANDLING OF THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN ERRATIC JUST LIKE HIS PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN. AND IT HAS PREVENTED FLORIDA SENIORS AND PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY FROM GIVING THE RELIEF THAT THEY NEED. DONALD TRUMP HAD NOT JUST BEEN WILLING TO NOT DO THE WORK. I THINK IT'S THAT JAN THAT I'M NOT SURE HE CARES ABOUT DELIVERING ANY REAL HELP. I THINK IT'S BOTH. PEOPLE SAFENET WILLING TO DO THE WORK. I DON'T THINK HE CARES MUCH ABOUT IT. WHILE WE ARE LOSING PRECIOUS TIME WITH YOUR LOVED ONES HE'S BEEN STUCK IN A SAND TRAP ON ONE OF HIS GOLF COURSES. AND WHEN HE DOES DECIDE TO LIFT A A FINGER IT ISN'T TO HELP YOU. IT'S TO PROPOSE NEW TAX CUTS FOR MILLIONAIRES. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. 100 WEALTHIEST BILLIONAIRES IN AMERICA ARE EXPECTED TO GET ANOTHER $30 $30 BILLION TAX CUT HE IS PROPOSING. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME THAT TAX THAT WAS PASSED IN 2019, AFTER 2017 WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES GOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX BREAKS. AND THEN THEY TURNED AROUND AND RAISE RICES ARE MEDICINES THAT YOU RELY ON TO STAY HEALTHY. AND THEY ARE STILL DOING IT EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. QUITE FRANKLY IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE BUT TRUMP DOESN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT LOWERING THE HEALTHCARE COST BECAUSE HE IS BEHOLDEN TO HELP HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE DRUG COMPANIES. AFTER ALL, HE'S ASKING THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AS I SPEAK, ASKING RIGHT NOW TO STRIKE DOWN THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE SENIORS ABILITY, MOST OF YOU ARE ON MEDICARE, BUT IT WOULD ELIMINATE YOUR ABILITY IN THE ACT WE PASSED I WAS ABLE HELP PUT IN PLACE, WAS YOU HAVE PREVENTATIVE SERVICES, ANNUAL CHECKUPS AND MAMMOGRAMS FOR FREE UNDER MEDICARE. IF THEY GET STRUCK DOWN THAT GETS WIPED OUT AS WELL. THE RISING PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES FOR MANY SENIORS AND PUT MEDICARE TRUST FUND AT RISK. AND BY THE WAY, WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE MEDICARE TRUST FUND, I SEE THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO ELIMINATE IT BUT REMEMBER DEBBIE WILL REMEMBER, WHEN HE'S NOT A BAD GUY IN TERMS OF HIS PERSONALITY WHEN THE FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BECAME SPEAKER, , WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY PROPOSE HALF A BILLION DOLLARS CUT IN MEDICARE FROM THE START, RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THESE GUYS MEAN WHAT THEY SAY. THIS PRESIDENT , DEBBIE POINTED OUT, HE WANTS TO TERMINATE THE TAX, IS DEDICATED TO FINANCING SOURCES TO BECOME TERMINATE IT. SOCIAL SECURITY ACTUARY, NOT JOE BIDEN PORTABLE THINK TANK FOR A NEWSPAPER, THE ACTUARY, SOLSTICE COULD HE SAYS, THAT WOULD BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY IN JUST A FEW YEARS, PUTTING THOSE MONTHLY CHECKS FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF SENIORS WHO RELY ON, MANY OF THEM DO A THING TO RELY ON, AT RISK. ALL THIS PRESIDENT KNOWS HOW TO DO IS PLAY GAMES WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES AND FAMILIES FUTURES. LAST WEEK HE ANNOUNCED HE WAS QUOTE WALKING AWAY FROM THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WERE NEVER, INEVITABLY FULLY ENGAGE IN. HE NEVER FULLY ENGAGED WITH THEM. THEM. TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL RELIEF FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES. DEBBIE WORKING LIKE THE DOUBLE IN-HOUSE PASSED THE HEROES ACT. THEY PASSED TWO OF THE PIECES OF LEGISLATION EARLIER TO PROVIDE FOR THE ABILITY TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, PEOPLE BEING KICKED OUT OF THE HOMES. HE TURNED HIS BACK ON SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. HE TURNED HIS BACK ON FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS WHO DEPEND ON LOCAL BUDGETS BUT LOCAL BUDGETS ARE BEING BROKEN AND HAVE TO BE BALANCED. I WILL JUST TAKE, MAKE NO HERE. WHEN WE INHERITED THE LARGEST RECESSION, THE GREATEST RECESSION SINCE THE DEPRESSION, WHAT HAPPENED? PRESIDENT PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE RECOVERY ACT, $800 BILLION. FIRST THING I WAS ABLE TO DO WHEN I I WAS ABLE TO MANAGE IT MYSELF WAS THAT PUT $147 BILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES BE ABLE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS, NOT HAVE TO FIRE POLICE OFFICERS OR FIREFIGHTERS COME NOT FIRED FIRST RESPONDERS, NOT TOO CLOSE TO HEALTH CLINICS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR STRAIGHT TO THE BREAKING POINT TURKEY TURNED HIS BACK ON EDUCATORS AND SCHOOL CHILDREN, TOOK AWAY SUPPORT FROM PPE AND CLEANING SUPPLIES AND VENTILATION YOU TO REOPEN SCHOOL SAFETY WHICH WE COULD DO IF WE FUNDED IT. HE TURNS HIS BACK ON EVERY SINGLE WORKER WHOSE JOB HASN'T COME BACK. AND NOW HE SAYS HE WANTS A DEAL. ONE DAY HE'S TWEETING RELIEF PACKAGE IS TOO BIG, THE NEXT DAY SAYING IT'S TOO SMALL. IT'S ALL A GAME. HE THINKS HE IS STILL ON HIS GAME SHOW. NO, , REALLY, HE ASKED THAT WAY FOR REAL. THIS IS A FLUKE AGAIN HE IS PLAYING. HIS LATEST GIMMICK HE WANTS TO MAIL SENIORS AT $200 PRESCRIPTION DRUG CASH CARD WITH HIS NAME ON IT SO YOU GET IT BEFORE ELECTION WITH HIS NAME ON IT. BUT WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO IS HE'S GOING TO RAID MEDICARE TRUST FUND TO PAY FOR THAT $200 WHICH SENIORS HAVE ALREADY SPENT BY PAYING MONEY INTO. HE THINKS HE CAN TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKET WITH ONE HAND AND PUT IT BACK WITH HIS NAME STAMPED ON IT ON THE OTHER HAND. AND CALL IT A GIFT. IT'S DISHONEST. IT'S RECKLESS AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HELP ANYBODY. IN FACT, ALL IT DOES UNDERMINE THE MEDICARE TRUST FUND AND INCREASE OVERALL OUT-OF-POCKET COST FOR SENIORS. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS. DONALD TRUMP HAS TRIED FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS TO LOWER COME HE SAYS HE WANTS TO LOWER DRUG PRICES, OKAY? BUT HE HASN'T DONE A SINGLE THING TO DO IT. IN FACT, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED A BILL, DEBBIE SUPPORTED, THE BRINK OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS ACROSS THE BOARD GIVING MEDICARE THE POWER IN WASHINGTON THE POWER TO NEGOTIATE, TO NEGOTIATE TO THE DRUG COMPANIES AND SAY IF AN ASPEN IS GOING TO COST HIM BEING CHARGED, I'M MAKING THIS UP, IF AN ASPEN WILL COST TWO CENTS AN ASPEN, THEY SAY WILL ONLY PAY YOU A PENNY, THEY ARE EITHER GOING TO DO OR NOT. THEY WILL HAVE TO DO IT. WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO GET DEBBIE AND I AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO DO THIS FOR YEARS. WE LOWER DRUG PRICES. WHAT DID PRESIDENT TRUMP DO? HE SAID IF IT PASSES HE WILL VETO IT, THREATENED TO VETO IT. FOLKS, DONALD TRUMP'S CHAOTIC AND DECISIVE , DIVISIVE LEADERSHIP HAS COST US FAR TOO MUCH. 215,000 DEAD FROM COVID-19, AND RISING. EXPERTS SAY WE WILL LOSE NEARLY ANOTHER 200,000 LIVES IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS UNLESS HE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED COURSES. I PRAYED PRAY FOR HIS RECOVERY WHEN HE GOT COVID. I HOPE THAT WE COULD COME OUT OF IT, BUT WHAT IS HE DONE? HE HAS JUST DOUBLE DOWN ON MISINFORMATION HE DID BEFORE MAKING IT WORSE. SO MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT CARES MORE ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET THAN HE DOES ABOUT THE WELL-BEING OF SENIORS ONE DAY BEFORE RECROSS THE THRESHOLD OF 200,000 THIS, YOU MAY RECALL THIS, THE PRESIDENT WAS PRESIDENT WAS AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY AND INSISTED THAT THE VIRUS WAS, AND THE QUOTE, AFFECTS VIRTUALLY NOBODY QUOTE, JUST ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH HEART AND OTHER PROBLEMS. NOBODY, THINK ABOUT THAT. WHO WAS HE TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE SAID IT INFECTS VIRTUALLY NOBODY? HE IS TALKING ABOUT AMERICA'S SENIORS. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU, TALKING ABOUT MY FAMILY. YOU WORKED HARD TO WHOLE LIFE CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIETY, BUILDING A FAMILY, BUILDING THE COUNTRY, SERVING AMERICA. YOU DESERVE SECURITY, DESERVE RESPECT AND PEACE OF MIND BUT YOU ARE NOT GETTING IT. BY THE WAY, IF THIS WASN'T SO BIZARRE YOU WOULD THINK, IF I TRIED TO MAKE A MOVIE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN AMERICA YOU WOULD THINK I WAS MAKING IT UP. BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS SIMPLE, NON-JOE, YOU ARE EXPENDABLE. YOU ARE FORGETTABLE. YOU ARE VIRTUALLY NOBODY. THAT'S HOW HE SEES THIS. THAT'S HOW HE SEES YOU. IT'S NO SURPRISE, THIS IS THE SAME AND IT LOOKS IN THE MIRROR , PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE, CAUSING LOSERS AND SUCKERS. I CARRIED THIS CARD WITH ME EVERYDAY FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS, IT'S MY SCHEDULE. THE BACK OF THE SCHEDULE I HAVE BLACK BOX THAT SAYS DAILY TROOP UPDATE. THE NUMBER OF TROOPS WHO DIED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, 6924. 6924. ROUGHLY 6900. 924 BECAUSE OF YOU ONE OF THESE FALLEN ANGELS LEFT THE FAMILY BEHIND, DESERVES TO BE REMEMBERED. EVERYONE. U.S. TROOPS WOUNDED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, 53,000 AS OF TODAY. 194. EVERYONE. WITH ONLY ONE SACRED OBLIGATION IN AMERICA, TO CARE FOR THOSE WE SENT TO WAR AND EQUIP THEM WHEN THEY COME HOME TAKE CARE OF THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND WHAT DID HE SAY? LOSERS. MY SON VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. BEFORE THAT HE HAD BEEN IN KOSOVO FOR EIGHT MONTHS. BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THE ONLY FOREIGNER HAS A WAR MONUMENT AND A MAJOR HIGHWAY IN THAT COUNTRY NAMED AFTER HIM FOR HIS CONTRIBUTION TO HELP THEM SET UP THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEN HE VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO IRAQ AS ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR A YEAR. MY SON WAS NOT A LOSER. AND ALL THOSE LEFT BEHIND COME HE PASSED AWAY BUT ALL THOSE HE LEFT BEHIND, THEY ARE HEROES, THEY ARE PATRIOTS. I IMAGINE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON WHY SIX 4-STAR GENERAL AND A LOT OF OTHERS ENDORSE ME TO USE TO WORK FOR HIM BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHERE HIS HEART ISN'T. THAT'S HOW HE SEES US. THAT'S THE ATTITUDE HAS BROUGHT THROUGH THIS WHOLE CRISIS. THIS IS THE SAME MAN YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS TOLD WE WERE AVERAGING 1000 LIVES LOST PER DAY. REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID IT IS WHAT IT IS. SUCH CONCERN AND EMPATHY. IT IS WHAT IT IS. WELL, IT IS WHAT IT IS BECAUSE HE IS WHO HE IS. THAT'S WHY IT IS WHAT IT IS. THIS PRESIDENT AS DEBBIE REFERENCED, BACK IN JANUARY WHEN HE WAS BEING BRIEFED BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HE SAID I NEVER READ THE BRIEFING. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT. DIDN'T HAVE TIME. WELL, HIS EGO MOVED IN TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE FAMOUS JOURNALIST TO WRITE SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT HIM. WHAT HAPPENED? BOB WOODWARD INTERVIEWED HIM. HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE KNEW IT WAS A DANGEROUS AND HIGHLY COMMUNICABLE DISEASE, BUT HE DID NOTHING. HE DIDN'T DO A THING. HE DIDN'T TELL YOU. HE DIDN'T TELL ANY AMERICAN. WHY? HE TOLD WOODWARD ON TAPE, TOLD BOB WOODWARD HE DIDN'T WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. AMERICANS DON'T PANIC. TRUMP PANICS. HIS RECKLESS PERSONAL CONDUCT SINCE HIS DIAGNOSIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE. THE LONGER DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT THE MORE RECKLESSLY SEEMS TO GET. THANK GOD WILL HAVE THREE WEEKS LEFT TO GO TO DR. FAUCI, MOST RESPECTED DOCTOR IN THE COUNTRY ON THIS DISEASE, REFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE SUPREME COURT IN THE ROSE GARDEN USING THE WHITE HOUSE AS A BACKDROP FOR POLITICAL EVENTS, HE SAID IT WAS A SUPER SPREADER EVENT. AND HOW IS TRUMP RESPONDING? HE'S RUNNING A NATIONAL AD QUOTING DR. FAUCI OUT OF CONTEXT. WITHOUT YOU SAID WAY BACK IN MARCH, REFERRING TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ACROSS THE NATION, HE SAID, QUOTE, I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY COULD BE DOING MORE COME IN THE QUOTE MEANING PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. AT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL IT DOES I GOT A PIECE THE COMPANY TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS DELIBERATELY LIED. THEY HAVE PUT DR. FAUCI IN THEIR AD, ASSERTING THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT TRUMP WHEN HE SAID HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE ANY MORE. BUT HOW CHEAP IS A MAN OF INTEGRITY , BUT DR. FAUCI IS MEANT OF INTEGRITY. AFTER THE AD CAME OUT HE SAID I I DID NOT GIVE PERMISSION TO USE THAT QUOTE AND I WASN'T REFERRING TO THE PRESIDENT. EVEN AFTER DR. FAUCI SAID THAT COME HE DIDN'T SAY THAT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. TRUMP AD CAMPAIGN SAID THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO USE THE ADD, KNOWING, KNOWING IT WAS A LIE. CAN ANY OF YOU EVER REMEMBER ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE PRESIDENT TO CAMPAIGN THE MAINSTREAM CANDIDATE, AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THE MONTHS OF LIFE, MISLEADING AND RESPONSIBLE ACTION A PART OF DONALD TRUMP, HOW MANY INTO CHAIRS AROUND THE DINING ROOM TABLE TONIGHT BECAUSE OF HIS NEGLIGENCE? HOW MANY PEOPLE HEARTS ARE BROKEN? HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE GOING TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, CAN'T JUST REACH OVER AND TOUCH? THEY CAN HEAR THEIR SONS OR DAUGHTERS VOICE ON THE PHONE. WELL, HE THROWS SUPER SPREADER PARTIES AT THE WHITE HOUSE, REPUBLICANS HELD EACH OTHER WITHOUT CONCERN OF THE CONSEQUENCES. HOW MANY OF YOU BEEN UNABLE TO HUG YOUR GRANDKIDS IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS? I GOT SIX OF THEM. TWO HAVE BEEN BEEN MY DECEASED SONS BOYS, CHILDREN, , A BOY AND GIRL, LIVE NOT FAR FROM IT. BILLY RAY CONCEDED, I STAND ON THE BACK PORCH AND A STANDDOWN AND I BRIBE THEM WITH HAAGEN-DAZS BARS. BUT EVERY SINGLE DAY I CONTACT THEM. I CAN'T HUG THEM. I CAN'T EMBRACE THEM. AND I'M LUCKIER THAN MOST BECAUSE THE ARE NEARBY, THOSE TWO OF THE SIX. MY GRANDKIDS, YOUR GRANDKIDS, HOPE WILL GROW TO TREAT ONE OF THE AS KINDNESS, RESPECT AND EMPATHY. QUALITIES THE PRESIDENT HAS NEVER EVER SHOWN. IT HAS BECOME PAINFULLY CLEAR AS CARELESS RESPONSE HAS CAUSED ONE OF THE WORST TRAGEDIES IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THE ONLY SENIOR THAT DONALD TRUMP CARES ABOUT, THE ONLY SENIOR IS SENIOR DONALD TRUMP. DOESN'T SEEM TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIM. AND BY THE WAY, MINORITY COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING PARTICULARLY HIT BY THIS. WE REALIZE AS OF ABOUT A MONTH AGO, ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS ONE IN 1000 AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN ALL OF AMERICA HAVE DIED. THE ESTIMATE IS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR ONE IN 500 AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND AMERICAN WILL DIE. ONE IN 500. IF HE DOESN'T DO SOMETHING QUICKLY AND WE HIT 400,000, THAT IS MORE PEOPLE, SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT DIED, 400,000 DEAD, THEN WORLD WAR II. IN LESS THAN A YEAR IF HE DOESN'T MOVE. THE ONLY ONE DOUBLE TROUBLE DO ANYTHING FOR HIS DONALD TRUMP. LOOK, FOLKS, YOU ALL KNOW THIS. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE CAN CONTAIN THIS VIRUS. WE CAN FULLY REOPEN OUR ECONOMY WE CAN BRING CONGRESS TOGETHER TO PASS REAL RELIEF AND IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA TO BUILD BACK BETTER. MY ECONOMIC PROPOSAL, AND BY THE WAY IT'S NOT A LIBERAL THINK TANK FOR DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK THAT SAYS THIS. AND IF THE ANALYSIS PUT OUT MY MOOD IS, A WALL STREET FIRM, PROJECTS THAT MY ECONOMIC PLAN WILL CREATE 18.6 MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS BETWEEN NOW AND IN THE FIRST TERM. 7 MILLION MORE JOBS THAN THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN, AND CREATE A TRULY MORE DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. IT'S SOLID, IT'S REAL. HERE'S HOW MY PLAN WORKS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON A SINGLE SOLITARY AMERICAN MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. WILL NOT PAY A PENNY MORE, IT SECURITY. I'M GOING AS BIG CORPORATIONS AND WEALTHY TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE TAX STRUCTURE. THAT MONEY WILL ALLOW US TO INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE WHO CARRY WITH IT I DON'T KNOW IF IT WITH ME NOW, I DON'T, A CARD THAT LISTS ALL OF WHAT IS IN THE TAX CODE. WE WENT AHEAD, PRESIDENT'S TAX PLAN, BARACK AND I'M SUGGESTING WE REDUCED CORPORATE TAX FROM 35% TO 28. 28. I WAS A CONSENSUS. HE REDUCED IT TO 21 DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE COST? $1.3 TRILLION. WE JUST TAKE IT BACK UP TO 28 AND IT WILL GENERATE $1.3 TRILLION MORE. .. CUT THE TAX AND 35 TO 21. THE SENATE RACING BACK TO 28%. $1.3 TRILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE INSTEAD OF DOING BIG CORPORATIONS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS FOR BUYBACK IN THEIR OWN STOCK, MOVING OVERSEAS, WE SHOULD INVEST IN CANCER, DIABETES, ALL LEVERS AND PARKINSON'S I PROPOSE GIVING NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH $50 BILLION OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, CANCER, DIABETES, OLD-TIMERS AND PARKINSON'S. IF WE DO NOT FIND AN ANSWER TO ALZHEIMER'S WITHIN THE NEXT 19 YEARS, EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY BED THAT EXISTS IN THE U.S. NOW WILL BE OCCUPIED BY OLD-TIMERS PATIENTS. MY DAD USED TO HAVE THIS EXPRESSION, JOE, IF EVERYTHING IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU, NOTHING IS IMPORTANT. WHERE OUR PRIORITIES? OUR PRIORITIES ARE TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IN AMERICA HAS AN EQUAL SHOT. IT'S ABOUT YOU, WHAT'S FAIR, ABOUT WHAT OUR PRIORITIES SHOULD BE WE CAN DEAL WITH CANCER IN THESE OTHER DISEASES BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS NO INTEREST. HE WANTS TO DO THE OPPOSITE. PROPOSES MORE TAX CUTS. DONALD TRUMP, EASE THE BURDEN ON MAJOR COSTS IN YOUR LIFE INCLUDING A FINANCIAL BURDEN IN CAREGIVING FOR MANY FAMILIES WITHOUT CARING. RIGHT NOW, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, 800,000 AMERICANS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HOME COMMUNITY CARE, SIGNED UP FOR, AN AVERAGE OF FIVE YEARS WAITING. FOR SOME, FIVE YEARS, MY PLAN MAKES INVESTMENTS SO THE STATE CAN CLEAR THE WAITING LIST. THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO ALLOW MEDICAID TO AGAIN USE IT NORMA'S PARTY AND NEGOTIATE PRICES AND BRING THE COST DOWN FOR EVERYONE. GIVING ALL AMERICANS ACCESS THEY ALSO HATE MY DOING, SO DO THE DRUG COMPANIES. THE EXPERTS TO SET PRICES, LIFE-SAVING DRUGS THAT COST AN ARM AND A LEG FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY. THEY HAVE NO COMPETITION, THE BOARD WAS SET UP AND SAY THIS IS HOW MUCH YOU BEEN CHARGED BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE INVESTED, WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE THE PRICE OF THE DRUG WITHOUT TAKING OTHER ACTION THAT HAS REQUIRED YOU TO IMPROVE THE DRUG. IT CAN ONLY BE RAISED WITH MEDICAL INFLATION. INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS FOUND MY LAND\/COST BY 60%. HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S HAD TO SELL THINGS JUST TO GET THE DRUGS HAVE GROWN UP EXPONENTIALLY? WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND INCREASED BENEFITS FOR MILLIONS OF SENIORS TO PROTECT YOUR PENSION INCLUDING PENSIONS, SO MANY FLORIDIANS EARN AND DESERVE. FOLKS, I WILL END WITH THIS, I AM CONFIDENT AS BAD AS THINGS ARE, HOW CAN I GET BETTER? I AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT WE CAN DO THIS AND MORE. WE JUST HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. A PROUD DEMOCRAT AND WILLING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. GOING TO WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO VOTE AGAINST ME AS THOSE WHO VOTED FOR ME. THAT IS THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT PRESIDENT. A DUTY TO CARE, TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, ALL AMERICA HAS ACCOMPLISHED, ALL THE YEARS WE SERVE AS A BEACON TO THE WORLD, WE CANNOT LET OURSELVES REMAIN DIVIDED. WE HAVE TO VOTE. GO TO I WILL VOTE.COM\/FL. CAN STILL REQUEST YOUR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. DEADLINE IS OCTOBER 24.

CONTROL OF CONGRESS AND WHO OCCUPIES THE WHITE HOUSE WILL BE DECIDED. STAY WITH US TO HEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN MAKE THEIR CASE TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. WATCH DEBATES AND SOME OF THE HOTLY CONTESTED HOUSE AND SENATE RACES. COVERAGE EVERY DAY ON C-SPAN. OR LISTEN ON THE FREE APP. YOUR PLACE FOR AN UNFILTERED VIEW OF POLITICS. JOE BIDEN CAMPAIGNED IN MICHIGAN TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE. PRESIDENT TRUMP WON MICHIGAN FOU R YEARS AGO. GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER LEADS OFF THE EVENT. GOVERNOR WHITMER BELIEVES IN SCIENCE, AND FACTS. WE ARE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION THAN WE WOULD BE OTHERWISE. WE SHARE A PASSION FOR HEALTH CARE. TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE. WE ARE THE HUNCH THAT COMES TO REPRESENTING MICHIGAN IN THE SENATE. BUT WE ARE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE. WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED DURING THIS PANDEMIC IS WE NEED LEADERSHIP. WE NEED NATIONAL LEADERSHIP TO LEAD US THROUGH THIS. JOE BIDEN HAS PROVED HE CAN DELIVER THAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP. IT WAS JOE BIDEN WHO HELPED LEAD US THROUGH A REALITY. HE HAS HELPED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. I REMEMBER THAT FIGHT. FOLKS WERE TRYING TO DEMONIZE IT AND ATTACKING IT. I REPRESENTED A REPUBLICAN DISTRICT. THIS REALLY MOVES US FORWARD IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. WE HAD A SITUATION WHERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DIED EVERY YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY. I SAID I'M VOTING FOR THIS. I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED. I STILL VIVIDLY REMEMBER PUSHING THE GREEN BUTTON WE WENT UP TO VOTE. HOW OFTEN CAN YOU PUSH A BUTTON AND SAVE THOUSANDS OF LIVES? THAT IS WHAT WE MADE SURE TO DO. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT BILL IS ON THE BALLOT. AFTER ALL THAT FIGHTING, ALL OF THAT STRUGGLING. IT IS ON THE BALLOT NOW. BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S RECKLESS LAWSUIT BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT, WHICH WILL BE TAKEN UP A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE SELECTION, IT COULD VERY WELL BE THROWN OUT. THIS NEW NOMINEE HAS MADE CLEAR WHAT HER POSITION IS. WE WILL GO BACK TO THE DATA , BATTLE DAYS. 1.7 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE COULD LOSE THE PROTECTION THEY HAVE NOW. WHEN BEING A WOMAN WAS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. 800000 AND ARE STATE NOW HAVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. THEY WILL BE BACK TO ANNUAL ALL CAPS BEING ELIMINATED. AND LIFETIME CAPS ON LAMINATED. FOLKS WILL FIND THEMSELVES BEING FORCED INTO BANKRUPTCY. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT ALONE IN TRYING TO DISMANTLE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. MY OPPONENT IN THIS SENATE RACE IS ALSO OPPOSED. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE NEVER COME UP WITH A PLAN. THEY HAVE TIME TO DO IT. IF YOU ASK WHAT'S THE PLAN, THEY GIVE YOU A BLANK STARE AND THEY WILL HAVE SHALLOW TALKING POINTS AND NEVER ADDRESSED THE ISSUES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THESE ARE SERIOUS TIMES. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. WE HAVE PEOPLE LOSING HEALTH CARE. WE NEED SERIOUS LEADERSHIP. WE NEED STEADY LEADERSHIP. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE NEED JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND JOE BIDEN ALSO NEEDS FRIENDS. HE NEEDS A MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE SO WE CAN MOVE THIS AGENDA. HE CANNOT DO IT ALONE. I WILL SAY IN CLOSING, THIS ISSUE IS NOT ACADEMIC. THIS IS NOT TALK. THIS IS REAL. THESE ARE REAL STORIES. I HAVE PEOPLE WITH VISIONS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT COME INTO MY OFFICE IN TEARS, NOT KNOWING WHAT THE FUTURE WILL MEAN FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. PEOPLE'S LIVES LITERALLY HANG IN THE BALANCE. THAT IS WHY I AM SO PROUD TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE MY FRIEND WHO WILL SHARE HER STORY ABOUT WHAT AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE MEANS TO HER AND HER FAMILY. PLEASE WELCOME ALEXIA. (music) I AM EVERYDAY PEOPLE YEAH, YEAH DIFFERENT STROKES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS SO ON AND SO FORTH AND SHOOBY DOOBY DO YEAH (music) WOW. WHAT AN INCREDIBLE HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, GOVERNOR WHITMER, SENATOR PETERS, CENTER SAMUEL , I AM GRATEFUL TO BE HER WITH YOU. I'M A STAY-AT-HOME MOM WITH THREE AMAZING CHILDREN. A 10 EUROS, AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD, AND A FOUR-YEAR-OLD MY HUSBAND MICHAEL OPERATES OUR SMALL BUSINESS. WHEN WE ARE FULLY STAFFED, OUR STAFF MEMBERS DO NOT QUALIFY TO NEGOTIATE WITH HEALTH CARE COMPANIES. BECAUSE OF THAT, BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, MY FAMILY DID NOT HAVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE UNTIL 2014. WE SADLY COULDN'T AFFORD IT. TO SAY THIS FOR A LOT OF STRESS ON HER FAMILY IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. MY HUSBAND, LIKE SO MANY AMERICANS, HAS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IT WAS ALWAYS WORSE WHEN HE COULD NOT SEE A DOCTOR OR TAKE HIS MEDICATION REGULARLY. I LIVED IN CONSTANT FEAR MY KIDS WOULD LOSE THEIR DAD, I WOULD LOSE MY HUSBAND, AND WE WOULD LOSE OUR BUSINESS. WHEN I WAS PREGNANT IN 2010 AND 2012, I TRY TO GET COVERAGE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO WAY TO GET COVERAGE AT RATES I COULD AFFORD. IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE ACA WE COULD TAKE A DEEP BREATH. AND YOU BEST BELIEVE AS SOON AS THE MARKETPLACE OPENED UP, WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST FAMILIES TO SIGN UP COVERAGE. A TREMENDOUS WEIGHT WAS LIFTED FROM OUR SHOULDERS. WE HAVE NOT HAD TO SWITCH PROVIDERS AND THE PRICING OF OUR MEDICATIONS ARE CONSISTENT PRICES WE CAN AFFORD. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THIS IS BEEN A REALLY TOUGH YEAR. I KNOW WE CAN ALL FEEL THAT. OUR BUSINESS HAS BEEN HIT HARD BY COVID-19. SINCE REOPENING, BUSINESS HAS BEEN UNPREDICTABLE AT BEST. MY BUSINESS WORKED SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. THIS GIVES US THE PEACE OF MIND THAT WE CAN GET THROUGH THE CHALLENGE. WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TRAINED TO DO I AM INFURIATED. THIS PRESIDENT AND THE SENATE HAS HAD FOUR YEARS TO COME UP WITH A PLAN. THEY HAVE HAD FOR YEARS TO PROVE THEY WILL NOT KICK PEOPLE OFF THEIR COVERAGE. THEY HAVE HAD FOUR YEARS TO SHOW AS THEY WILL PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS LIKE MY HUSBAND, AND THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT TRY TO STOP THE ACA AT EVERY SINGLE TURN. THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO ELECT JOE BIDEN AND GARY PETERS IN NOVEMBER. JOE BIDEN IS SOMEONE WE CAN TRUST. HE IS SOMEONE WITH INTEGRITY WHO DOES WHAT HE SAYS IS GOING TO DO. HE BELIEVES IN SCIENCE, AND I BELIEVE IN HIM. HE BELIEVES IN OUR COUNTRY AND WHAT'S TO DO WHAT IS BEST FOR ALL OF US. HE WILL TRULY BE A PRESIDENT FOR ALL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR HIM OR NOT. OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT DOES NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT ME OR MY FAMILY OR OUR SMALL BUSINESS EITHER. IF HE DID, HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THIS SERIOUSLY FROM THE BEGINNING. HE WOULD'VE HAD A PLAN. HE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO PROTECT ALL AMERICANS. HE WOULD NOT TRY TO GUT THE INSURANCE OF 20 MILLION AMERICANS. WE NEED TO ELECT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS AND WE NEED TO REELECT GARY PETERS TO THE SENATE. THEY WILL FIGHT FOR US AND OUR HEALTH CARE, AND WITH THAT, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE , I AM SO PROUD TO SAY , OUR GREAT GOVERNOR, GRETCHEN WHITMER, AND OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. PEOPLE, KEEP ON LEARNING SOLDIERS, KEEP ON WARRING WORLD, KEEP ON TURNING (music) I AM SO PLEASED TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU AND I AM SO PLEASED THAT JOE BIDEN IS BACK IN MICHIGAN. WE KNOW THIS. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN OUR LIFETIMES, AND THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR MANY REASONS. ONE OF THE MOST COMPELLING REASONS IS THE HEALTH CARE OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IS ON THE BALLOT AND THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE. IS PERSONAL FOR SO MANY FAMILIES. IS PERSONAL FOR ME. 18 YEARS AGO I BECAME A MEMBER OF THE SANDWICH GENERATION, AND THAT SIMPLY MEANS I WAS SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO MEMBERS OF MY OWN FAMILY FOR WHOM I WAS THE PRIMARY CAREGIVER. MY MOTHER AT THE END OF HER LIFE AND MY DAUGHTER AT THE BEGINNING OF HERS. WHILE MY MOM BATTLED BRAIN CANCER, I WAS ON THE PHONE FIGHTING HER INSURANCE COMPANY, WHO WAS WRONGFULLY DENYING COVERING HER CHEMOTHERAPY. THERE ARE SO MANY AMERICANS THAT HAVE A SIMILAR STORY THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS OR ARE GOING THROUGH IT RIGHT NOW. THE BRAIN CANCER THAT KILLED MY MOM WAS THE SAME KIND THAT TOOK VP BIDEN'S SON BEAU. THAT TIME OF MY LIFE WAS DEVASTATING AND IT CHANGED ME, AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY I WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE TO DELIVER HEALTH CARE FOR MICHIGANDERS, TO ENSURE WE EXPANDED MEDICAID, AND NOW 800,000 PEOPLE HAVE HEALTH CARE BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE. IT TOOK WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE TO GET IT DONE. WE HAD A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR. I WAS THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER. WE FOUND COMMON GROUND BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE. I KNOW THAT JOE BIDEN WILL DO THE SAME. I KNOW THAT JOE BIDEN SHOWS UP AND HAS OUR BACK WHEN WE NEED HIM. HE WORKED WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. HE WORKED TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. HE WAS HERE DURING THE AUTO INDUSTRY RESCUE. MICHIGAN SUPPORTS JOE BIDEN BECAUSE JOE BIDEN SUPPORTS MICHIGAN. THE JOE BIDEN WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE IS THE JOE BIDEN WHO ROLLS UP HIS SLEEVES AND WORKS TO GET THINGS DONE AND WORKS WITH ANYONE HE NEEDS TO. HE'S A GOOD, DECENT AMERICAN WHO WILL PROTECT AND EXPAND HEALTH CARE. GOOD PAYING JOBS, JOBS YOU CAN SUPPORT A FAMILY ON. AND HE WILL MAKE SURE THAT NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE WHERE YOU COME FROM, YOU HAVE A FAIR SHOT. HE WILL MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE AVAILABLE FOR MORE AMERICANS. WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT FOCUSED ON FINDING COMMON GROUND. HE HAS BEEN RUNNING A SCORCHED EARTH AGENDA FOR YEARS. NOT ONLY DOES HE WANT TO TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE, BUT HE'S IN COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO DISMANTLE THE ACA. INSTEAD OF BRINGING THE HEAT DOWN, HE RATCHETED UP WITH INCENDIARY RHETORIC. INSTEAD OF BUILDING BRIDGES, HE FOCUSES ON BUILDING WALLS. HE ALWAYS HAS BEEN. IN THIS UPCOMING ELECTION, OUR CHOICE COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR. WHILE JOE BIDEN WORKS TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT HAS KILLED 218,000 AMERICANS, NEARLY 7000 MICHIGANDERS, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WORKS TO TAKE THAT HEALTH CARE AWAY. THEY HAVE ENDANGERED THEIR OWN SUPPORTERS. NOT ONLY IS THE TRUMP VIRUS RESPONSE THREATENING OUR LIVES AND ECONOMY, BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES ON THEIR QUEST TO DENY COVERAGE TO PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. NEARLY EIGHT MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR COVERAGE, TOO. THE DIFFERENCE COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR. THAT'S WHY WE ARE OPTIMISTIC. WITH OUR HISTORIC LEADERSHIP, OUR PHENOMENAL CAPACITY FOR CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH, INDUSTRY, AND EVASION, AND MANUFACTURING, AMERICA CAN HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE REFORMED WITH THE UNIFIED COVID RESPONSE THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED LIVES, MITIGATED THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT AND MADE US A GLOBAL LEADER, THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION NEVER HAD A PLAN TO PROTECT AMERICANS. THEY SQUANDERED OUR MIGHT AND OUR CAPACITY BY MAKING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL. IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN DEATHS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED HAD THE PRESIDENT TREATED COVID-19 LIKE THE CRISIS HE KNEW IT TO BE FROM THE BEGINNING. MORE THAN 60 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE UNITED STATES. 218,000 DEATHS. LINES AT FOOD PANTRIES. AMERICANS BANNED FROM TRAVELING TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND THE COVID NUMBERS KEEP GOING UP. IT'S STILL GETTING WORSE. THERE IS GOOD NEWS. THERE IS A CREDIBLY DECENT MAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO IS FIGHTING FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. TO THE MOMS WHO ARE AT HOME, WORKING, TRYING TO GET THEIR KIDS LOGGED ON TO ZOOM, EVEN THE LAUNDRY DONE, TAKING CARE OF THE FAMILY, JOE BIDEN WORKS FOR YOU. TO THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO SPENT A LIFETIME BEEN SOMETHING GREAT AND ARE HANGING ON BY THEIR FINGERNAILS, JOE BIDEN WORKS FOR YOU. TO THE GRANDPARENTS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE, MUCH LESS HUG THEIR GRANDKIDS, JOE BIDEN WORKS FOR YOU. TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS TO HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE, JOE BIDEN IS WORKING FOR YOU, TOO. WHICH CANDIDATE CAN GET COVID-19 UNDER CONTROL? WHICH MAN IS GOING TO GET US BACK TO WORK. WHO COULD BRING US TOGETHER AS A NATION. IN MOST YEARS, IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS THERE ARE TWO DECENT CHOICES. THIS YEAR THERE IS ONE. JOE BIDEN. WE MUST ALL VOTE AS IF OUR LIVES AND OUR LIVELIHOODS AND HE SOUL OF OUR NATION DEPEND ON IT BECAUSE THEY DO. WITH THAT, I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIEND AND OUR NEXT PRESIDENT'S, JOE BIDEN. HELLO, MICHIGAN. HOW ARE YOU? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME, TELLING YOUR STORY. IT'S IMPORTANT. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF STORIES LIKE YOURS ALL OVER AMERICA. I TRAVELED THE COUNTRY, TOO MANY DON'T HAVE TO BE. FOLKS, IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. THERE IS NOT A BETTER GOVERNOR IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S A FACT. I'VE MET VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM. GARY, WE BADLY NEED YOU BACK IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, PAL. WE BADLY NEED YOU BACK. [APPLAUSE] MY SISTER, DEBBIE STABENOW, GOD LOVE YOU. WE WORKED TOGETHER SO CLOSELY FOR SO LONG AND AS VICE PRESIDENT AS WELL. FOLKS, LOOK, WE NEED TO SEND AREA BACK FOR ANOTHER TERM STANDING UP FOR MICHIGAN, MICHIGAN FAMILIES, SMALL BUSINESSES. HE WAS OUR MAIN CONGRESSIONAL PARTNER IN 2010 WHEN WE PASSED CRITICAL LEGISLATION SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES. I REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT GIVING ME THE RESPONSIBILITY TO GO OUT AND ROUND UP SUPPORT. MY GO TO GUY TO GET IT DONE, AND I MEAN IT SINCERELY, WAS GARY. HE WAS THE GO TO GUY. HE ALWAYS SHOWS UP AND HE ALWAYS SHOWS UP FOR MICHIGAN. LIKE ALL OF YOU, JILL AND I ARE SO GRATEFUL THAT GOVERNOR AND HER FAMILY ARE SAFE. IT'S AN UNUSUAL YEAR. GOVERNOR, YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT BUT YOU ARE A LEADER. YOU STAND UP STRAIGHT AND TALL AND YOU DON'T THEN. IT'S NOT EASY TO LEAD AND MOMENTS OF CRISIS, BUT THAT THE DETERMINATION WHETHER YOU HAVE A REAL LEADER, WHEN YOU STEP UP TO THE CRISIS. AND YOU STEPPED UP. YOU'VE DONE IT AND YOU KEEP DOING IT. [APPLAUSE] AS I SAID A MOMENT AGO, YOU'RE DOING BETTER THAN PUT IN MUCH EVERYONE ELSE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. YOU'VE SHOWN THIS WHOLE NATION HOW TOUGH AND THOUGHTFUL YOU ARE. TOUGH LIKE MICHIGAN. I'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THIS STATE HAS TO BE SO PROUD OF YOU. I KNOW I AM AS I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW YOU AND I'M PROUD TO CALL YOU FRIEND. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE FBI AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO DISCOVERED THESE DOMESTIC TERRORISTS AND STOPPED IT. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THAT IS WHO THEY ARE, DOMESTIC TERRORISTS. [APPLAUSE] PLANNING TO BLOW UP A BRIDGE ON AMERICAN SOIL TO THREATEN THE LIVES OF POLICE OFFICERS, TO KIDNAP AN ELECTED LEADER, NOW WE ARE FINDING OUT THE SAME THING WAS HAPPENING IN VIRGINIA. IT IS THE SORT OF BEHAVIOR YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM ISIS. IT SHOULD SHOCK THE CONSCIOUS OF EVERY AMERICAN. THE FAILURE TO CONDEMN THESE FOLKS IS STUNNING FROM THE OUTSET. I REMEMBER, IT MATTERS, YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY IT BEFORE , WORDS MATTER. THE WORDS OF A PRESIDENT PARTICULARLY MATTER. WHEN THE PRESIDENT TWEETED \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN\" THAT IS THE CALL THAT WAS HEARD. THAT WAS THE DOG WHISTLE, JUST LIKE WHEN HE SAID THERE WERE \"VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES\" IN CHARLOTTESVILLE AS THEY CAME OUT OF THE FIELDS CARRYING TORCHES, VEINS BULGING, SHOUTING ANTI-SEMITIC SLOGANS, CARRYING CONFEDERATE FLAGS AND ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN. A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED PROTESTING. THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED WHAT DO YOU THINK AND HE SAID SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER, EVER, EVER HEARD , \"THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES.\" THOSE WORDS WERE HEARD JUST LIKE WHEN HE STOOD ON THE DEBATE STAGE WITH ME AND REFUSED TO DENOUNCE WHITE SUPREMACISTS. HE TOLD A RIGHT WING EXTREMIST GROUP TO STAND BACK AND STAND BY. STAND BACK AND STAND BY. AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. NOT ONLY SHOCKED US, BUT IT STUNNED THE WORLD. THOSE WORDS, WE HEARD. YOU KNOW THE REASON I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, AND I KNOW DEBBIE KNOWS THIS. I HADN'T PLANNED ON RUNNING EVER AGAIN AFTER MY SON DIED. BUT WHEN I SAW THOSE FOLKS COME OUT OF THOSE WOODS, I THOUGHT HOW IN GOD'S NAME, HOW IN GOD'S NAME CAN I REMAIN SILENT? I SAID AT THE TIME, IT WAS SOMEWHAT NOT CRITICIZE BUT PEOPLE , I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. I SAID WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. I THINK WE ARE. WHAT I SAW AT CHARLOTTESVILLE IN THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE TO IT IS WHY I WENT TO GETTYSBURG BATTLEFIELD IN PENNSYLVANIA LAST WEEK. IT IS NEEDED TO STAND UP TO HATE IN AMERICA AND HER JUST AS LINCOLN DID TO COME TOGETHER AS A NATION. I HAVE LEARNED HATE NEVER GOES AWAY, IT ONLY HIDES. IT NEVER GOES AWAY. IF YOU GIVE IT OXYGEN, IT COMES OUT FROM UNDER THE ROCKS AND GROWS. WE NEED TO BE CLEAR, FROM THE PRESIDENT ON DOWN, IN THIS COUNTRY, THERE IS NO PLACE FOR HATE IN AMERICA. NONE. IT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP REVELS IN DIVISION AND CHAOS. HE WILL DO ANYTHING TO DISTRACT US FROM FOCUSING ON HIS FAILURES TO DEAL WITH THIS VIRUS AND PROTECT THE NATION. HE STILL LIVING IN A DREAM WORLD. HE KEEPS TELLING US THIS VIRUS IS GOING TO DISAPPEAR LIKE A MIRACLE. HE SAID, I THINK LAST NIGHT IN HIS TOWN HALL , I DID NOT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF HEARING IT. I WAS DOING ONE MYSELF. HE SAID \"WE HAVE TURNED THE CORNER.\" AS MY GRANDFATHER MIGHT SAY IF HE WERE HERE, HE'S GONE AROUND THE BEND. TURN THE CORNER? MY LORD. IT'S NOT DISAPPEARING, IN FACT, IT IS ON THE RISE AGAIN. IT'S GETTING WORSE, AS PREDICTED. WE ALL KNOW THE TERRIBLE PRICE THIS NATION HAS PAID. LIVES LOST, UNEMPLOYMENT WAY UP, ACROSS MICHIGAN AND THE COUNTRY, FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING THEIR NEXT RENT PAYMENT OR MORTGAGE PAYMENT. WHETHER HEALTH CARE WILL BE RIPPED AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. YOU WORKED SO DAM HARD, GARY, TO KEEP , WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BUDGET. KIDS AT SCHOOL, ARE THEY ABLE TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL? MORE THAN 215,000 AMERICANS, I THINK IT'S 217 AS OF THIS MORNING, AMERICANS HAVE DIED FROM COVID-19. EXPERTS HAVE SAID AND HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF THAT NEARLY ANOTHER 200,000 LIVES ARE LIKELY TO BE LOST IN THE COMING MONTHS BETWEEN NOW AND THE FIRST OF THE YEAR IF WE CONTINUE TO REFUSE TO FOLLOW SCIENCE. HE REFUSED TO EMBRACE WEARING A MASK , HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN HIM MAKE FUN OF BIDEN WEARING A MASK? BECAUSE HE REFUSES TO PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING. HE PUTS HIS SUPPORTERS IN SUCH JEOPARDY. IT'S ESTIMATED BY HIS OWN FOLKS IF WE JUST WORE A MASK NATIONALLY, ALMOST 100,000 LIVES WOULD BE SAVED IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. HIS OWN DIRECTOR OF THE CDC SAID WE ARE WAITING FOR A VACCINE, EVEN IF WE HAD A VACCINE, THIS WOULD PREVENT OR DEATHS. BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF JANUARY, THEN THE VACCINE WOULD. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY SAD ABOUT ALL OF THIS? I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS, BUT EVERY TIME I REPEAT IT, I GET MORE , WELL , I'M NOT VERY HAPPY. THE PRESIDENT KNEW AND LIED ABOUT KNOWING. HE KNEW IN JANUARY. THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND WHAT THEY CALL THE PDB , THE PRESIDENTIAL DAILY BRIEFINGS, WHICH I SAT IN ON HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THEM AS VICE PRESIDENT. THEY LAID OUT IN DETAIL TO HIM HOW DEVASTATING THIS COULD BE. HOW MUCH LIFE COULD BE LOST AND SO ON. HE SAID HE WAS UNAWARE. DIDN'T READ THOSE REPORTS. THAT SURPRISED NO ONE THAT HE DIDN'T READ THE REPORTS. EVERYBODY SAID MAYBE HE DID, BUT THEN, AS IS ACKNOWLEDGED BECAUSE OF HIS EGO, HE WANTED TO IMPRESS A FAVORITE JOURNALIST. HE DID A LONG INTERVIEW WITH BOB WOODWARD. BOB WOODWARD, RENOWNED JOURNALIST, TAPED THE INTERVIEW WITH HIM, EXTENSIVE INTERVIEWS, HOURS. HE TAPED AN INTERVIEW WERE TRUMP SAID HE KNEW THIS DISEASE WAS DEADLY, SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE THAN THE FLU. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE TOLD YOU. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE TOLD THE PUBLIC. AND THE REASON HE LIED AGAIN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AMERICANS DON'T PANIC. DONALD TRUMP PANICKED. THAT'S WHO PANICKED. [APPLAUSE] THE CONSEQUENCE WAS OVERWHELMING NEGLIGENCE , HOW MANY EMPTY CHAIRS AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE THIS MORNING WHERE THE DINING ROOM TABLE LAST NIGHT? HOW MANY? HOW MANY WOMEN OR MEN THAT WHEN THEY GOT IN BED LAST NIGHT REACHED OVER TO TOUCH THEIR HUSBAND OR WIFE AND THEY WEREN'T THERE? YOU ALL KNOW WHAT LOSS IS. IT'S PROFOUND. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS AVOIDABLE. THE MISHANDLING OF THE PANDEMIC ISN'T ENOUGH FOR TRUMP. ON TOP OF THAT, HE STILL TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTH CARE. TRUMP IS STILL DETERMINED IN THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC , BY THE WAY, IF PROJECTIONS, PRAY GOD THEY ARE NOT RIGHT, IF THEY ARE RIGHT, IN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS, THERE WILL BE OVER 200,000 ADDITIONAL DEATHS. THAT WILL BE ONE YEAR, 400,000 AMERICANS WILL HAVE DIED. THAT'S MORE THAN LOST IN ALL OF WORLD WAR II. DO YOU HEAR ME? WORLD WAR II WAS FOUR YEARS. MORE AMERICAN SOULS WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST THEN IN WORLD WAR II. BUT WHAT IS HE DOING? HE STILL DETERMINED TO DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THIS ISN'T HYPERBOLE. JUST LIKE YOUR OPPONENT CALLS IT A DISASTER, TALK ABOUT A DISASTER , THERE IS A DISASTER. THE GUY'S 2000%, 200% WITH TRUMP , I HOPE EVERYBODY REMEMBERS. THIS ISN'T HYPERBOLE. IT'S AS REAL AS IT GETS. ON NOVEMBER 10, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAKE THE CASE THAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SHOULD BE STRUCK DOWN IN ITS ENTIRETY. I KNOW EVERYBODY THINKS THEY KNOW, BUT I WANT TO REMIND YOU, 10 MILLION OF YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE YOUR EMPLOYERS HEALTH INSURANCE HAS GONE OUT OF BUSINESS. 10 MILLION AMERICANS ALREADY WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE. IF TRUMP GETS HIS WAY, 20 MILLION MORE AMERICANS WILL LOSE THEIR HEALTH CARE. IT IS GOD-AWFUL, IN THE MIDST OF THIS GOD-AWFUL ECONOMIC CRISIS, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MORE THAN 4 MILLION PEOPLE RIGHT HERE IN MICHIGAN. LIMITS ON BENEFITS WILL BE BACK. AND BY THE WAY, A LOT OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH WHAT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH AND WORSE. I CAN DISTINCTLY REMEMBER SITTING ON THE BED WITH MY SON WHO CAME BACK FROM A YEAR SERVING IN IRAQ, WHICH THIS PRESIDENT TALKS ABOUT LOSERS , LOSERS , WITH THE SAME SIGNIFICANT DISEASE THAT YOUR MOM HAD, STAGE FOUR GLIOBLASTOMA. WHEN IT WAS DIAGNOSED AND HE GOT HOME, WE ASKED THE DOCS, IT WAS A MATTER OF MONTHS, NOT IF. WE NEVER GAVE UP HOPE. I REMEMBER WATCHING HIM ON THAT BED. HE MADE IT ALMOST 16 MONTHS. TOWARD THE END, THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME, THIS IS ABOUT ALL OF YOU. I CONSCIOUSLY THOUGHT TO MYSELF WHAT WOULD IT FEEL LIKE IF THEY WERE ABLE TO WALK IN AND SAY MR. BIDEN, YOU HAVE OUTRUN YOUR INSURANCE COVERAGE? LOTS OF LUCK. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. INSURERS, IF THEY WIN, AND THAT'S WHAT THIS COURT PACKING IS ABOUT. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO KEEP YOUR KIDS ON YOUR POLICY UNTIL THE AGE OF 26. WOMEN WILL BE CHARGED MORE FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE A WOMAN. OLDER FOLKS WILL BE ABLE TO BE CHARGED MORE. AS THE GOVERNOR SAID, LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID WILL BECOME PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS JOINING ASTHMA, DIABETES, EVEN PREGNANCY. IT WILL ALLOW INSURERS TO JACK UP YOUR PREMIUMS OR DENY COVERAGE ALTOGETHER. GETTING RID OF OBAMACARE IS WHY THEY ARE RACING TO GET THIS NOMINEE THROUGH THE SUPREME COURT. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. TRUMP HAS MADE IT CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING AS YOUR OPPONENT HAS, HE WANTS TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE IN ITS ENTIRETY. WITH THIS NOMINEE, HE'S MADE THAT INCREDIBLY CLEAR AS WELL. MICHIGAN DESERVES SO MUCH BETTER. IT DESERVES LEADERS LIKE GARY AND DEBBIE STABENOW, PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO LEAD WITH DECENCY AND HONOR, WHO ALWAYS LOOK OUT FOR YOUR NEEDS. THINK ABOUT HOW TO EASE THE BURDEN ON YOUR FAMILY. THAT'S THE SORT OF LEADER YOU'VE GOT IN GRETCHEN, AND GOVERNOR WITMER AS WELL. IN THE STATE SENATE, SHE LED THE CHARGE TO EXPAND THE OBAMACARE MEDICAID EXPANSION. SOME OF THE STATES REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS DID NOT EXPAND EVEN THOUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PAYING FOR THE FRONT-END. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO COVERAGE. AFTER WE PASSED OBAMACARE WITH THE HELP OF DEBBIE AND GARY, DEBBIE STABENOW AND GARY PETERS, WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE UNINSURED RATE BY 55% IN MICHIGAN. IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BECOMING HER PRESIDENT, WE WILL BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO. YOU CAN CHOOSE TO KEEP A PRIVATE PLAN IF YOU STILL HAVE ONE. SOME OF THE PLANS NEGOTIATED ARE GOOD PLANS. WE WILL ALSO OFFER A MEDICARE-LIKE PUBLIC OPTION WHICH WILL FORCE PRIVATE INSURERS TO KEEP PREMIUMS LOW. FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY WILL HAVE TO COMPETE FOR YOUR BUSINESS AGAINST A PUBLIC INSURER THAT DOES NOT HAVE A PROFIT MOTIVE IN MIND. IF YOU CHOOSE THIS PUBLIC OPTION OR PRIVATE PLAN, IT WILL INCREASE SUBSIDIES FOR YOUR PREMIUMS SO THEY ARE LOWER. YOU CAN AFFORD OUR PLANS WITH LOWER DEDUCTIBLES, LOWER OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING. AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS FOUND MY PLAN WILL\/THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BY 60%. NOT A LIBERAL THINK TANK. SERIOUS FOLKS LOOKING AT THIS. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. MY PLAN LOWERS HEALTH CARE COSTS AND GETS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE QUICKLY AT A TIME WHEN MICHIGAN FAMILIES DESPERATELY NEED THAT RELIEF. THEY NEED IT NOW. FAMILIES ARE REELING RIGHT NOW. THEY NEED A LIFELINE NOW. AND I PROMISE YOU WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH COVERAGE THE SAME WAY I WOULD MY OWN FAMILY. I GREW UP, LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE, IN SCRANTON PENNSYLVANIA AND WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, A HOME WITH FOUR KIDS AND A GRAND POP WITH US. WHEN MY DAD MOVED FROM SCRANTON WITH NO WORK AND MOVE DOWN TO DELAWARE AND STAYED WITH MY GRANDPA FOR A YEAR AND CAME HOME EVERY WEEKEND. HE FINALLY GOT A JOB, IT ENDED UP BEING SECTION EIGHT HOUSING BUT IT WAS DECENT AND WE WERE HAPPY. IT TOOK MY DAD THREE YEARS TO GET A JOB GOOD ENOUGH THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY BUY A HOME. BOUGHT THAT SMALL HOME. THERE WERE 70 HOMES LIKE IT, THREE AND FOUR BEDROOM HOMES. BUT THE WALLS WERE THIN AND I LOOK BACK AND I WONDER HOW MY MOM AND DAD DID IT. I REMEMBER YOU COULD HEAR HIM RESTLESSLY ROLLING IN THE BEDROOM NEXT TO ME AND I ASKED MY MOM THE NEXT MORNING, WHAT'S WRONG WITH DAD? SHE SAID HONEY, IT'S COMPLICATED. I SAID WHAT'S THE MATTER, MOM? I WAS LIKE 14 YEARS OLD. SHE SAID THE COMPANY JUST LOST HIS HEALTH INSURANCE. WE ARE GOING TO BE OK. ALL THE PEOPLE ROLLING AROUND IN BED TONIGHT, TOMORROW NIGHT, LAST NIGHT, TRUMP DOESN'T SEE THINGS THIS WAY. BECAUSE HE ONLY SEES THINGS, SEES THE WORLD FROM A PARK AVENUE PERSPECTIVE. I'M NOT BEING A WISE GUY, I'M BEING LITERAL. HE CAN ONLY SEE FROM HIS PENTHOUSE, WALL STREET. I SEE THE WORLD FROM WHERE I GREW UP. MY MOM TAUGHT ME, MY MOM HAD A BACKBONE LIKE A RAMROD. MY MOM TAUGHT ME AND SAID LOOK AT ME, NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU, JOEY. BUT EVERYBODY IS YOUR EQUAL. THAT IS HOW I WAS RAISED. I THINK YOU AND I, WE MEASURE PEOPLE, WHETHER YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, WE MEASURE PEOPLE ON THE STRENGTH OF THEIR CHARACTER, THEIR HONESTY, DECENCY, RECOGNIZING SOME THINGS ARE BIGGER THAN JUST YOUR SELF INTEREST. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT , RESPECT, DECENCY, HONOR, OPPORTUNITY. OUR FAMILY AND YOURS WERE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING, JUST AN EVEN SHOT. GIVE IT A SHOT AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER LET THEIR COUNTRY DOWN. THAT'S WHAT MICHIGAN NEEDS NOW COME A SHOT TO COME BACK STRONG. THAT'S WHAT YOU NEEDED 10 YEARS AGO IN YOUR AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, THE HEART AND SOUL OF MICHIGAN WAS ON THE BRINK. MY STATE USED TO BE AN AUTO STATE, A SMALL POPULATION, WE HAD THE HIGHEST POPULATION OF AUTOWORKERS THAN ANY STATE IN THE NATION BECAUSE WE HAD LESS THAN A MILLION PEOPLE. THE LARGEST GENERAL MOTORS AND CHRYSLER PLANTS OUTSIDE OF MICHIGAN. BUT YOU REMEMBER LIKE I DO, YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE YESTERDAY. WHEN BARACK AND I DECIDED WE HAD TO BET ON MICHIGAN, REMEMBER THE LOW BACK, EVEN FROM DEMOCRATS? WE CAN'T COMPETE. WE BET ON AUTOWORKERS. WE BET ON THE UAW, AND THEY CAME THROUGH AND PAID OFF. [APPLAUSE] FOR REAL. THE INDUSTRY WASN'T IN TROUBLE, IT WASN'T IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF THE AUTOWORKERS, BUT BECAUSE OF MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. GENERAL MOTORS AND CHRYSLER, SAVING OVER ONE MILLION JOBS BY THAT ONE DEAL. [APPLAUSE] DON'T EVER UNDERESTIMATE THE AMERICAN WORKER. BY CONTRAST, ON DONALD TRUMP'S WATCH, WE ARE IN A NATIONWIDE MANUFACTURING RECESSION BEFORE COVID STRUCK. WE ARE NOW DOWN NEARLY 650,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, NOW. NOW IT IS RISING. IN FACT, DONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY TO LEAVE OFFICE, GOD WILLING, TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS THAN HE HAD WHEN HE STARTED IN OFFICE. THE LAST ONE WAS HERBERT HOOVER. FOR REAL. FOLKS, WE CAN BRING THIS ECONOMY BACK. I'M POSITIVE OF IT. I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT IT. WE KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING IT. AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS ON WALL STREET, MOODY'S, A WELL-RESPECTED FIRM HAS DONE AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF EVERY ASPECT OF MY PLAN AS WELL AS HIS. YOU KNOW WHAT THE CONCLUSION WAS? THIS IS MOODY'S, NOW. MY PLAN WILL CREATE 18.6 MILLION JOBS, 7 MILLION MORE THAN HIS WOULD, AND $1 TRILLION MORE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN. BY INVESTING IN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, YOU SEE THESE ADS IN MICHIGAN , BIDEN IS GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. ONCE AGAIN, FLAT, UNADULTERATED LIE. NO ONE WHO MAKES LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR WILL PAY A PENNY MORE. IF YOU MAKE MORE THAN THAT, YOU ARE GOING TO START PAYING THE RATE YOU PAID UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF GEORGE W. BUSH. I'M GOING TO ASK BIG CORPORATIONS IN THE VERY WEALTHY TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE FOR A CHANGE. TRUMP'S MORE THAN $2 TRILLION TAX CUT, I'M GOING TO ROLL BACK $1.5 TRILLION OF THAT, GIVEAWAYS TO THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN THE TOP 1%. THE MONEY WE RAISE, WE WILL INVEST IN WORKING PEOPLE, GROWING THE MIDDLE CLASS, THIS TIME MAKE SURE WE BRING EVERYBODY ALONG, BLACK, WHITE, HISPANIC, DISABLED , EVERYONE COMES ALONG. OUTSIDE ECONOMISTS SAY MY PLAN WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS IN MANUFACTURING. WE WILL INVEST IN BUILDING MORE RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE. REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT SAID I HAD AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN IN 2017, THEN 2018, THEN 2019, THEN 2020. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY PLAN. I'M GOING TO BUILD A RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE, CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS, BUILDING ROADS AND BRIDGES AND PORTS. ONE MILLION NEW JOBS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. ONE MILLION NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. HIGH-SPEED BROAD BAND FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD. $100 BILLION TO REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING SCHOOLS. ONE REASON WE CAN'T SEND OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL, A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT EVEN SAFE NOW. WE ARE GOING TO RETROFIT AS WE STARTED IN OUR ADMINISTRATION WHEN THE PRESIDENT ALLOWED ME TO RUN THE RECOVERY ACT. WE ARE GOING TO RETROFIT 4 MILLION BUILDINGS AND WEATHERIZE 2 MILLION HOMES. THAT ALONE WILL SAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL. IT IS ALL GOING TO BE DONE BY CERTIFIED UNION LABOR. [APPLAUSE] I'M GOING TO END , HE TALKS ABOUT HIS TRADE DEALS. AS GARY AND DEBBIE KNOW, HE INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO SEND JOBS ABROAD. ABROAD. MORE ARE TAKING THEIR JOBS OVERSEAS. ONE THING MORE , THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OWNS AND MAINTAINS AN ENORMOUS FLEET OF VEHICLES AND I PROMISE YOU THE PRESIDENT CONTROLS IT. I'M GOING TO CONVERT THOSE GOVERNMENT FLEETS INTO CLEAN VEHICLES MADE AND SOURCED RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I'M GOING TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY SO THE UNITED STATES, NOT CHINA, LEADS THE WORLD IN CLEAN VEHICLE PRODUCTION. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO SWITCH TO FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLES, WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A NETWORK OF 500,000 CHARGING STATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, OFFER CONSUMER REBATES TO SWAP FUEL INEFFICIENT VEHICLES FOR AMERICAN-MADE MODELS AND TOGETHER, THIS WILL MEAN ACCORDING TO THE ESTIMATES, MORE THAN A MILLION GOOD NEW JOBS IN THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE WILL OWN THE ELECTRIC AUTOMOBILE MARKET IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] I GUARANTEE YOU WE CAN DO THIS. BUT WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. I REMEMBER YOU AND I TALKING, GOV, YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT I WAS RIGHT. THAT USED TO BE THE OLD DAYS. YOU GOT A LOT DONE. YOU USED TO HAVE TO WALK ACROSS THE AISLE TO GET EVERYTHING DONE BUT EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED. WELL, FOLKS, IF WE CAN'T UNITE THE COUNTRY, WE ARE IN TROUBLE. AMERICA AND OUR SYSTEM RUNS ON CONSENSUS. COMPROMISE IS NOT A DIRTY WORD. I'M RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT I'M GOING TO GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. I DO NOT SEE AMERICA IN TERMS OF RED AND BLUE. BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, THAT'S THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT. IT'S A DUTY TO CARE, TO CARE FOR EVERYBODY. WE CAN BE SO MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT WE SEE. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST, WHEN WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] YOU HAVE TO VOTE. AND PEOPLE ARE TURNING OUT IN OVERWHELMING NUMBERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT, GO VISIT I WILL VOTE.COM\/M-I. EARLY VOTING IS HAPPENING NOW. IN EVERY CITY, TOWNSHIP AND CLERKS OFFICE ACROSS THE STATE. YOU CAN REGISTER AND VOTE IN ONE QUICK STOP. YOU HAVE YOUR BALLOT ALREADY, MAIL IT OR DROP IT IN A DROPBOX TODAY. DON'T WAIT. VOTE.

WE ARE GOING TO NEED GARY BACK IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE LOOKING OUT FOR MICHIGAN FAMILIES BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO WIN BACK THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND WHEN WE DO, WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THINGS. [APPLAUSE] I REALLY MEAN THIS, IT'S TIME TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA. TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS. THIS TIME, LET'S BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. DEBBIE MAY REMEMBER MY COLLEAGUES IN THE CAUCUS USED TO KID ME BECAUSE I WOULD QUOTE PRESIDENT KENNEDY ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON AND HIS FAMOUS SPEECH. EVERYBODY REMEMBERS DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT. THE ONE I REMEMBER MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, HE ANSWERS THE QUESTION OF , THAT WASN'T IMPLICITLY BEING ASKED , WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? HE SAID WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE. I REFUSE TO POSTPONE THE AMERICAN WORK AMERICA MUST DO NOW TO BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK. THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. THERE'S NO LIMIT TO AMERICA'S FUTURE. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF. NO OTHER COUNTRY CAN DO THIS. EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE HAVE TO KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR, UNITY OVER DIVISION, SCIENCE OVER FICTION AND YES, TRUTH OVERLIES. [APPLAUSE] SO, FOLKS, THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

U auto huddle on the bus or something, Folks, I can't tell you how much I appreciate you being here. It's what time is it now? Seven o'clock at night. Cold is a devil in your hair and I thank you very, very much. Detroit. There's no better. No more appropriate place. Told the drive in rally that in Motor City. Yusa. I wanna thank effort. I wanna thank you Every for sharing this story with us and for the unfailing dedication that you and so maney. You're proud union educators. We owe you. We owe you big for the students and families you take care of during these difficult times. I'm married. I'm Jill Biden's husband. She's an educator. So that's what teaching is is just not what she does. It's who she is. So ever. Thank you and folks. Look, I also want to thank the incredible leaders who are here today. My good friend Mary Duggan and Mayor Doug and I spent an awful lot of time together trying to get Detroit back. He got it back on on the upside. But I was here when trying to get the every all the help he could possibly get to get it done. When there's vice president fighting to support this city, invest in the revitalization. The future of Detroit, Because I've always believed in Detroit, not just saying that my dad was an automobile man. That's what got me through school. That's what everything was about. I've always believed in Michigan we have the finest auto workers in the world here in Michigan. That's not hyperbole. That's a fact e I wanna thank you, Chairwoman Barnes. Thank you very, very much. And Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist, you've been a good friend, Governor Wittner, you've been an incredible leader. Tested. She had been tested and proven under crisis conditions and extraordinary circumstances. Your leadership through this pandemic has saved countless lives of Michiganders here. Gov That's a fact. And you've shown the whole nation just how tough you are. Michigan Tough. I'm proud to call your friend and Senator Debbie Stabenow. Gary Peters. Thank you for fighting for the people of Michigan who need help now but aren't getting it because the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, cares more about shoving through a Supreme Court nomination to take away your healthcare than he does helping the hurting people in this city, this state in this country we can't forget. The winning in November doesn't just mean defeating Donald Trump. It means winning back to United States Senate and expanding our majority in the House of Representatives. That's why we need to send Gary back to Washington. D. C. Yeah, I really mean that we need him. That's the guy who knows what he believes and says what he believes and does what he believes and alongside Debbie Stabenow. For the people of Michigan, but not quite frankly, for the whole country, folks, is my coaches to say it's go time. It's the most important election of our lifetimes, and you could make all the difference here in Michigan, the choice is as clear as ever, and the stakes are higher than ever. The stakes are in this election. Remind me of something my dad used to say, said Joey. A job's about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in your communities. Be able to look your child in the eye and say, Honey is gonna be okay and made it well, that's a lesson Never I've never for gotten. That's what I grew up surrounded by hard working families in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Claymont, Delaware. How many people today, though, can look their kids in the eye and say everything's gonna be alright and mean it? These times are hard. Unemployment is way up due to the pandemic. Just this week, over a million 200,000 more people file for unemployment. The economic outlook for next year remains uncertain, and across Michigan and the country. Folks are worried about making their next rent payment or the mortgage payment or the car payment. They're worried whether or not they can purchase the prescription drugs they need or put food on the table. Have to make a choice. Worried about sending their kids to school, worried about not sending their kids to school. They see the people of the top doing a hell of a lot better while the rest of her left to wonder who's looking out for me. That's Donald Trump's presidency. More than 215 South. I think it's now 217,000 dead Americans because of Kovar, 19 and, experts say, will lose nearly 200,000 more lives in the next few months. All because this president cares Mawr about his Park Avenue perspective on the world in the stock market than he does about you because refused to follow the science. It's estimated. If we just wore these masks between now and the end of the year, we'd save 100,000 lives. Folks, you know what's really sad about all this? The president knew he knew back in January how dangerous this virus Waas, and he hit it from the American people, he told the journalist Bob Woodward in a taped interview. The disease was deadly and Janner deadly and far worse than the flu an airborne. But here's what he did. According to New York Times today, his administration gave Wall Street investors heads up about it, didn't tell us, but gave Wall Street investors ahead up. But the American people, he said nothing. That's why they made so much money. By quote selling short, they knew what was coming. What happened to the rest of us, he told Bob, ordered he didn't want to panic the American people. We don't panic. He panicked. And his reckless personal conduct, since his diagnosis has been unconscionable. Longer. Donald Trump is president, the more reckless he gets. Dr. Fauci, the leading expert in the country, referred to the president's announcement on the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden as quote a super spreader event causing so many people to get covered. And how did Trump respond? Responded by running a national ad taking Dr Fauci's words out of context, Dr Fauci said way back in March, quote, I can't imagine anybody could be doing Mawr, referring to the public health officials that Trump took that quote out of context and put in a campaign ad deliberately line, making it sound like Dr Fauci was talking about him. Even after foul, she asked him to take the ad down. Trump's campaign said they continue to use the ad knowing it was a lie. That behavior is no surprise. After all, this is the same man who looks at Americans who put their lives on the line like my son put the lives on the line to save our nation. Calls them losers and suckers. My son both spent a year in Iraq on The Bronze Star, the conspicuous service belt. He was no sucker, and the people he left behind were heroes. And now now is a consequence of this overwhelming line. Misleading, irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump. How many empty chairs are there going to be around the dining room table tonight because of his negligence? Folks, we're so much better than this is a country. Despite the crisis we face, we haven't enormous opportunity. The build back better the American people that the blinders taken off to replace Donald Trump's incentives for companies to ship jobs overseas with real policies and tax credits to revitalize American manufacturing. To make it in America. Make it in Michigan by American look. We're going to do everything to give everyone a fair return on their work. Unequal chance to get ahead, for example, and communities of color here in Detroit and all across the country, the question is, how do we break the cycle? We're in good times. You lag behind and bad times. You're the first hit, then hit the hardest and the recovery. The last one is the bounce back. The answer is about justice, criminal justice, policing, reform. This nation is strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong enough to provide safe streets for our families and small businesses that too often bear the brunt of looting and burning. We have no need for armed militias roaming America streets, and we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacist group menacing our community. And these guys were hatching violent and deranged schemes like the one against Governor Rittner that the FBI and local law enforcement uncovered and stopped last week. But make no mistake, that was a planned act of terrorism. A plot? Think of this. A plot in the United States of America to blow up a bridge on American soil, to threaten the lives of police officers to kidnapping American leader. There's a sort of behavior you might expect from Isis and should shock the conscience or American to see that sort of twisted thinking take root here in America. We'll all president does. Trump does is fan the flames of hatred and division in this country, telling the proud boys in the debate with May. When I said, Well, you condemn them, he said, I'll tell them to stand back and stand by. What the hell is the matter with this guy attacking Governor Wittner on the same day this plot was exposed? It's despicable. And by the same measure, we say we have no need to face racial injustice. This country, you haven't opened your eyes to the truth of America today, the powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months. George Floyd, six year old daughter who I met with, and when I met the family Jean I knelt down to say hi to her and she said, looked at me and said, Daddy, change the world. Jacob Blake's mother, another one when I met with her, said violence doesn't reflect who her son is and the nation needs healing and said she's playing praying for the police officers. Or Doc Rivers, the basketball coach, choking back tears when he said Quote, We're the ones getting killed, We're the ones getting shot. We've been hung. It's amazing why we keep loving this country, and this country doesn't love us back. Think about that. Think about what it takes to be a black person. Love America today that is a deep love. This country that is far too long has not been fully recognized. What we need in America's leadership to seek the escalate tensions, open the lines of communications to bring us back together again to heel toe hope as president. That's precisely what I'll do. But true justice is also about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability, families of color building, building wealth, passing it down. That's how I deliver equality and equity. Another example. More and more women are dropping out of the workplace because of the recession. We're in a city around the suburbs, have a plan to deal with pandemic responsibly. New testing Tracing, masking, not politicizing The race for vaccine planning for safe and equitable distribution, Providing PP and other resource is for schools to reopen safely. He's the caregiving crisis that so many families were experiencing. Squeeze between raising your kid and caring for your agent loved ones and protect your health care in the Middle East pandemic. Why don't Republicans have the time? As I said, toe hold a hearing on the Supreme Court instead of addressing the significant upcoming needs of local communities. I'll tell you why. It's about wiping out Obama care, wiping it off the books because her nominee is said in the past that the law should be struck down is gonna take away health care coverage for 20 million Americans. I'll also take away prevent protections for pre existing conditions that more than 100 million people in America have complications of covert 19. We'll also add to that long scoring heart damage could well become the next pre existing condition that will toss out. The rule allows Children to be covered on their parents. Health insurers. So lays 26. We'll take us backwards to an insurance companies could charge a woman more for health care than a man just because she's a woman, folks, we could do so much better together. I'll build on the affordable care Act where you can choose to keep your private insurance as well as offer Medicaid like public option, which will give private insurance real competition. We're gonna increase subsidies so your premiums are lower. You can afford to plan with lower deductibles, lower out of pocket spending, folks. We could only do this if we come together as a country. Abraham Lincoln told us that a house divided cannot stand today. Trust is, Ebby, Hope seems elusive. Instead of healing, we're being ripped apart. I refused to let that happen. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisan in this country, a spirit of being able to work with another. When I say that, I'm told that used to be the way Joe used to get a lot of things done. But things have changed. Well, I'm here to tell you can't happen again, and they must must if there's anything going to get anything done. I'm running is a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president I work with Democrats and Republicans. That's why so many Republican leaders have endorsed me. They know I've done it. We'll do it again. For those who don't support me as well as those who do. Folks, that's the job of a president, the duty to care the duty to heal. And you, too have a sacred duty. As my friend John Lewis used to say, Vote, it matters. Michigan matters. You elected me and Barack Obama in 2000 and 12 and you bet on us when we bet on you and bet on American workers. We bet on the U. A W. I'm asking for your trusted support in 2020 for Camel and may we'll always have your back, I promise you. So please vote. Help us Get out the vote Goto. I will vote dot com slash m I in Detroit more than 20 years. Look, you have now 20 early voting centers. They're open now all across the city, open seven days a week in election day, it's a one stop shop. You could go get registered and vote right then and there. So don't wait. Vote today. Tell everyone you know everyone you meet vote, vote, vote. And no matter what, don't let anybody discourage you or tell your vote won't count, because it does you, The American people are gonna decide the future of this country vote. It's time to restore America's soul. It's time to rebuild the backbone of this country. The middle class and unions built the middle class. No matter what your ace rager gender folks, folks, look, it's time to unite America. It really is. I'll never forget what President Kennedy said about going to the moon. My colleagues in the Senate used to kid me but raising it when I bring it up in a caucus, he answered the question that was on everybody lips. But nobody asked. Why are we doing this? He said. We're doing it because we refused to postpone. I refused to postpone any longer. The work America must dio. There's nothing beyond our capacity. There's no limit to America's future. The only thing could tear America apart is America itself. Look, everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let's show him who we are. We choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction and, yes, truth over lies. It's standard time to stand up Take back our country. God bless you all And may God protect our troops. Go get him. We can do this. Thank you. Thank you, Thank you.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?477058-1\/joe-biden-speaks-voter-mobilization-event-detroit","Summary":"Former Vice President Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, spoke at a &ldquo;get-out-the-vote&rdquo; event in Detroit.","Source":"477058-1","Type":"Speech"}

THE VERY SOUL OF THE NATION IS AT STAKE. AS MY COOK , AS MY FOLKS USED TO SAY IN COLLEGE, IT IS GO TIME. THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN OUR LIFETIME. THE CHOICE IS AS CLEAR AS IT HAS EVER BEEN AND STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION REMIND ME OF SOMETHING MY DAD USED TO SAY WHEN WE LOST IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, WHEN I WAS A KID. HE OWES USED TO SAY A JOB IS A LOT , ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, RESPECT, AND YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. HE SAID, AND THIS IS THE GODS TRUTH, IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY HONEY, IT WILL BE OK.

THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE. HE CONTINUES TO LIE TO US ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. EXPERTS SAY WE ARE LUCKY TO LOSE AS MANY AS 200,000 ADDITIONAL LIVES BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR ALL BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT CARES MORE ABOUT HIS PARK AVENUE PERSPECTIVE AROUND THE WORLD, THE STOCK MARKET, THEN HE DOES ABOUT YOU. HE REFUSES TO FOLLOW THE SCIENCE. IT IS ESTIMATED BETWEEN THE END OF THE YEAR , NOW IN THE END OF THE YEAR, 100,000 LIVES. HIS OWN HEAD OF THE CDC SAID THAT. WHAT IS SAD IS THE PRESIDENT KNEW HOW DANGEROUS THE VIRUS WAS ALL THE WAY BACK IN JANUARY. HE HIT IT FROM THE COUNTRY. HE IS ON RECORD. HE TOLD BOB WOODWARD IN A TAPED INTERVIEW THAT THE DISEASE WAS DEADLY AND MUCH WORSE THAN THE FLU AND HERE'S WHAT HE DID. ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES, THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO, I GAVE WALL STREET INVESTORS A HEADS UP BUT HE DID NOT TELL US. THAT IS WHY THEY MADE SO MUCH MONEY BY SELLING SHORT. YOU ALL GOT SOLD SHORT. YOU KNOW WHAT IS COMING? BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST OF US TRIED TO CLAIM WITH WOODWARD THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT PANIC. TRUMP PANICS. [HONKING] THE SELFISH BEHAVIORS NO SURPRISE. THIS IS THE SAME MAN WHO LOOKS AT AMERICANS WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR THE NATION, LIKE SO MANY TENS OF THOUSANDS IN NORTH CAROLINA HAVE DONE, LIKE MY SON DID WINNING A BRONZE STAR. HE CALLS THEM SUCKERS AND LOSERS. WHO THE HELL DOES HE THINK HE IS TALKING ABOUT? THESE ARE HEROES. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE SACRIFICING. THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ALL OF THE IRRESPONSIBLE ACTION, HOW MANY CHAIRS WERE EMPTIED AT THE TABLE LAST NIGHT BECAUSE OF THIS NEGLIGENCE? WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. DESPITE THE CRISIS WE FACE, WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY. WE COULD BUILD BACK BETTER. WE JUST HAVE TO STAND UP AND TAKE IT BACK. LOOK. WE CAN BUILD THE ECONOMY AND AN EQUAL CHANCE TO GET AHEAD. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN NORTH CAROLINA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THE QUESTION IS, IN THE GOOD TIMES COME YOU LAG BEHIND. THE ANSWER IS ABOUT JUSTICE. CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND POLICE REFORM. THIS NATION IS STRONG ENOUGH TO BE HONEST THAT WE FACE SYSTEMIC RACISM FOR THE FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT TOO OFTEN BEAR THE BRUNT OF LOOTING AND BURNING. WE HAVE NO NEED ROAMING THE AMERICANS , AMERICA'S STREETS. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WE SHOULD HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR AN EXTREMIST WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUP MARCHING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT IF YOU SAY WE HAVE NO , NO NEED TO FACE RACIAL INJUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU HAVE NOT HOPE , OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE TRUTH. THERE HAVE BEEN POWERFUL VOICES FOR JUSTICE IN RECENT MONTHS. GEORGE FLOYD'S SIX-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, I KNELT DOWN TO SAY HI TO HER AND SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, DADDY CHANGED THE WORLD. JACOB BLAKE'S MOTHER SAYS VIOLENCE DOES NOT REFLECT HER SON AND THE NATION NEEDS HEALING AND SHE SAID SHE PRAYS FOR POLICE OFFICERS. DOC RIVERS, A BASKETBALL COACH, CHOKING BACK TEARS WHEN HE SAID WE ARE THE ONES GETTING KILLED. WE ARE THE ONES GETTING SHOT. WE HAVE BEEN HUNG. IT IS AMAZING WHY WE KEEP LOVING THIS COUNTRY IN THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT LOVE US BACK. THINK ABOUT THAT, WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A BLACK PERSON, TO LOVE THE COUNTRY TODAY AS HE DOES, A DEEP LOVE FOR THE COUNTRY. WE NEED LEADERSHIP TO DE-ESCALATE TENSIONS, OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION, AND BRING US TOGETHER, TO HEAL AND TO HOPE. AS PRESIDENT, THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I WILL DO. TRUE JUSTICE IS ALSO ABOUT GOOD PAYING JOBS, FINANCIAL STABILITY. IT WAS RIGHT HERE A CENTURY AGO THAT AN OASIS OF BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES THRIVED. EVEN IN THE ERA OF JIM CROW. THE UNITED STATES WAS ONE OF THE FIRST EXAMPLES OF FLOURISHING BLACK MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS. A PLAYSET OFFERED THE GIVING FAMILIES A REAL SHOT AT A HOME, SEND A CHILD TO COLLEGE DEBT-FREE SO THEY COULD BUILD WEALTH AND PASS OPPORTUNITY DOWN. THEY BUILT EVERY OTHER MIDDLE-CLASS GROUP IN AMERICA. THAT IS HOW WE DELIVER EQUALITY AND EQUITY. ANOTHER EXAMPLE, MORE WOMEN ARE DROPPING OUT OF THE WORKFORCE IN THIS RECESSION, WHETHER IN CITIES OR SUBURBS. I HAVE A PLAN TO DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC RESPONSIBLY, TESTING, TRACING, MASKING, PLANNING FOR A SAFE AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION, PROVIDING FUNDING FOR PPE AND OTHER RESOURCES, FOR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN SAFELY. SO MANY FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING, SQUEEZED BETWEEN RAISING HER KIDS AND CARING FOR AN AGING LOVED ONE. PROTECTING YOUR HEALTH CARE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC, WHY THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THE TIME TO HOLD A HEARING ON THE SUPREME COURT INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE ECONOMIC NEEDS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I WILL TELL YOU WHY, FOR REAL. I WILL TELL YOU WHY. IT IS ABOUT WIPING OBAMACARE OFF THE BOOKS, THAT IS WHAT IT IS ABOUT. THEIR NOMINEE HAS SET IN THE PAST, THE LAW SHOULD BE STRUCK DOWN. IF THEY GET THEIR WAY, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE THEIR PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. COMPLICATIONS OF COVID-19, 7 MILLION PEOPLE INFECTED, WILL BECOME THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, ALLOWING INSURERS TO JACK UP YOUR PREMIUMS OR DENIED YOUR COVERAGE. WOMEN WILL BE CHARGED MORE FOR THEIR HEALTH JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN. FOLKS, WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER. I WILL BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE, YOU CAN CHOOSE THE MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION. WE ARE GOING TO LOWER YOUR PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING. YOUR GOVERNOR HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TO EXPAND MEDICAID, BUT IT IS BEING BLOCKED BY REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE. MY PLAN WILL INVOLVE 357,000 UNINSURED WITH CAROLINIANS IN A PUBLIC OPTION FOR FREE AUTOMATICALLY. IT IS GOING TO MAKE A LIFE-CHANGING DIFFERENCE FOR SO MANY FAMILIES. WE CAN ONLY DO ANY OF THIS IF WE COME TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY. WE NEED TO REVIVE THE SPIRIT A BIPARTISANSHIP, ESPECIALLY BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER. I SAID THAT FROM THE MOMENT I ANNOUNCED, I WAS TOLD, MAYBE WE USED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT, THAT WAS YOUR REPUTATION IN THE SENATE, BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED, THEY DON'T WORK THAT WAY ANYMORE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THEY CAN AND THEY WILL AND THEY MUST IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE IN AMERICA. FOLKS, I'M RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. NO RED STATES, NO BLUE STATES, JUST THE UNITED STATES. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DID, THAT IS THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT, A DUTY TO CARE FOR EVERYONE IN AMERICA. FOLKS, AND YOU TOO HAVE A SACRED DUTY, TO VOTE, AND IT MATTERS. NORTH CAROLINA MATTERS. SENATOR HARRIS AND I ARE ASKING YOU FOR YOUR TRUST AND SUPPORT. WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK, SO PLEASE VOTE AND HELP GET OUT THE VOTE. GO TO IWILLVOTE.COM\/NC. EARLY VOTING STARTED ON THURSDAY. WE HAVE TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING. WE CAN'T LET UP. YOU CAN VOTE EARLY IN PERSON UNTIL THE 31ST, BUT DON'T WAIT. GO VOTE TODAY AND DON'T JUST VOTE FOR ME AND SENATOR HARRIS, YOU HAVE A GOVERNORS RACE, SENATE RACE, A RECORD NUMBER OF BLACK WOMEN ON THE BALLOT, LABOR COMMISSIONERS, THE COURTS. FOLKS, THEY ARE READY TO DELIVER FOR NORTH CAROLINA FAMILIES, SO VOTE. IT IS TIME. WHEN I ANNOUNCE MY CANDIDACY, I HAD NOT PLANNED ON RUNNING AGAIN AND I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE, MY SON HAD JUST DIED AND I HAD NO INTEREST. THEN I SAW THOSE FOLKS COME OUT OF THE FIELDS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE CARRYING TORCHES. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE, THEIR VEINS BULGING, SHOUTING ANTI-SEMITIC BILE, THE SAME PILE THAT WAS SHOUTED IN THE STREETS OF GERMANY IN THE 1930'S, CARRYING NAZI FLAGS, ACCOMPANIED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN AND A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED WHO WAS PROTESTING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. WHEN ASKED FOR COMMENT, THIS PRESIDENT SAID SOMETHING NO OTHER PRESIDENT HAS EVER SAID. HE SAID, THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. VERY FINE PEOPLE. I MEAN IT WHEN I SAY THIS. IT IS TIME TO RESTORE AMERICA'S SOUL. IT IS TIME TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA, THE MIDDLE CLASS, AND BRING EVERYBODY ALONG, NO MATTER YOUR RACE, AGE, RELIGION, GENDER, ETHNICITY, OR DISABILITY. WE CAN DO THIS. THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF, THEY HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED. IT IS TIME TO UNITE AMERICA. I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID WHEN I WAS A KID WHEN WE WERE GOING TO THE MOON. EVERY KID IN SCHOOL HURT HIS SPEECH. HE USED THE LINE IN THAT SPEECH, MY SENATE COLLEAGUES IN THE WHITE HOUSE HEARD ME USE ALL THE TIME, THAT MADE THE MOST IMPRESSION ON ME. HE ASKED, WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? HIS RESPONSE WAS, HE SAID, BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE. THIS IS AMERICA. WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE AMERICA'S WORK THAT MUST BE DONE. THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. WE HAVE NEVER, NEVER, NEVER MAILED HERE AND THERE IS NO LIMIT ON OUR FUTURE HERE IN , NEVER FAILED. THERE IS NO LIMIT ON OUR FUTURE. EVERYONE KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS, SO LET HIM DO WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION, SCIENCE OVER FICTION. AND YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES. FOLKS, IT IS TIME TO STAND UP AND TAKE BACK OUR DEMOCRACY. NO MORE TIME GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

HE GOT $3.5 MILLION , YOUR FAMILY GOT $3.5 MILLION AND SOMEDAY YOU WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN. I NEVER GOT ANY MONEY FROM RUSSIA. I DON'T GET MONEY FROM RUSSIA. ABOUT YOUR THING LAST NIGHT, I KNEW ALL ABOUT THAT. THROUGH JOHN RATCLIFFE, WHO IS FANTASTIC, HE SAID THE ONE THING THAT IS COMMON TO BOTH OF THEM, THEY BOTH WANT YOU TO LOSE, BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY TOUGHER TO RUSSIA BETWEEN THE SANCTIONS. NOBODY TOUGHER THAN BE ON RUSSIA. BETWEEN THE SANCTIONS, ALL OF WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH NATO, I GOT THE NATO COUNTRIES TO PUT UP AN EXTRA 130 BILLION GOING TO $420 BILLION A YEAR. THAT'S TO GUARD AGAINST RUSSIA. WHILE HE WAS SELLING PILLOWS AND SHEETS, I SOLD 10 COMBUSTORS , TANK BUSTERS TO UKRAINE. THERE'S NOBODY TOUGHER ON RUSSIA THAN DONALD TRUMP. LAST NIGHT, WE SAW THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND REPEATEDLY LIE ABOUT THE STATE OF THIS PANDEMIC. WE SAW HIM REFUSED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CRISIS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MET WITH PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. INSTEAD, IT HAS COST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN LIVES AND PUSHED MILLIONS INTO POVERTY. WE SAW HIM DIMINISH THE PAIN FELT BY SO MANY AMERICANS. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, WE ARE ROUNDING THE CORNER, IT IS GOING AWAY, WE ARE LEARNING TO LIVE WITH IT. THEY ARE QUOTES. AS I TOLD HIM LAST NIGHT, WE ARE NOT LEARNING TO LIVE WITH IT, WE ARE LEARNING TO DIE WITH IT. THIS IS A DARK WINTER AHEAD. ALREADY, MORE THAN 200 20,000 PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS VIRUS. 220,000 EMPTY CHAIRS AT DINNER TABLES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. MY HEART GOES OUT TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAS HAD TO E NDURE THE AGONY OF SAYING GOODBYE TO SOMEONE THEY LOVED OVER VIDEO CHAT, WHO COULD NOT GATHER THEIR CLOSEST FRIENDS, EVEN THEIR FULL FAMILY TO GRIEVE TOGETHER AT A FUNERAL SERVICE. WORSE YET, A NEW STUDY FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SUGGESTS THAT ANYWHERE BETWEEN 130,000 AND 210,000 OF THOSE DEATHS WERE AVOIDABLE. LEADING MEDICAL JOURNAL IN AMERICA, FRANKLY IN THE WORLD, WROTE AN UNPRECEDENTED EDITORIAL , TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE NEVER WRITTEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THEY CRITICIZE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DANGEROUSLY INCOMPETENT RESPONSE AND STATED THAT HE TOOK A CRISIS AND TURNED IT INTO A TRAGEDY. COVID-19 DWARFS ANYTHING WE HAVE FACED IN RECENT HISTORY AND IT IS NOT SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. THE VIRUS IS SURGING IN ALMOST EVERY STATE. WE PASSED 4.8 MILLION CASES. WHEN TRUMP WAS ASKED THIS WEEK WHAT HE WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY TO GET THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE RIGHT FROM THE START, HIS ANSWER WAS, AND I QUOTE, NOT MUCH. NOT MUCH. AS MANY AS 210,000 AVOIDABLE DEATHS, THERE IS NOT MUCH HE WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY? THE UNITED STATES IS 4% OF THE ENTIRE WORLD POPULATION, YET WE MAKE UP 20% OF ALL THE DEATHS WORLDWIDE. IF THIS IS A SUCCESS, WHAT DOES A FAILURE LOOK LIKE? WE ARE MORE THAN EIGHT MONTHS INTO THIS CRISIS, THE PRESIDENT STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN. HE HAS GIVEN UP. HE HAS QUIT ON YOU. HE HAS QUIT ON YOUR FAMILY. HE HAS QUIT ON AMERICA. HE JUST WANTS US TO GO NUMB AND RESIGN TO THE HORRORS OF THIS DEATH TOLL AND THE PAIN IT IS CAUSING SO MANY AMERICANS. HE CAN'T ERASE HIS OWN WORDS OR DEEDS. IN FEBRUARY, HE KNEW HOW DANGEROUS THIS VIRUS WAS. HE TOLD BOB WOODWARD, THIS DISEASE WAS DEADLY, FAR WORSE THAN THE FLU. BUT INSTEAD OF TELLING US HOW BAD IT WAS GOING TO BE, ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES, HIS ADMINISTRATION ONLY GAVE WALL STREET INVESTORS A HEADS UP. THEY MADE A BUNDLE DOING SOMETHING CALLED SELLING SHORT OR BETTING AGAINST THE MARKET THE REST OF US TOOK THE FULL BRUNT OF IT. IN JUNE, WHEN WE BEGIN TO SEE THE RESURGENCE OF COVID-19, I CALLED OUT PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR WAVERING, AND WAVING THE WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER TO THE VIRUS. BUT THEN, IT WAS AS IF HE DECIDED TO GO ON OFFENSE FOR THE VIRUS, HOLDING RALLIES WITH NO MASKS, NO SOCIAL DISTANCING, WHERE PEOPLE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS, INVITING THE VIRUS INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, HOSTING WHAT DR. FAUCI CALLED SUPER-SPREADER FEARS EVENTS, ENDANGERING MORE PEOPLE'S LIVES BY TELLING THE PUBLIC, DON'T WORRY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE DISEASE, DON'T LET IT DOMINATE YOU. HOW MANY PEOPLE IN ARIZONA WILL END UP SUFFERING BECAUSE THEY LISTENED TO THE PRESIDENT. KRISTIN SAID HER DAD VOTED FOR TRUMP, LISTENED TO HIM, DIDN'T THINK THE VIRUS WAS A BIG DEAL. AT DAD BECAME INFECTED , ENTER DAD BECAME INFECTED, AND HE DIED. KRISTIN SAID HER DAD'S ONLY PRE-EXISTING CONDITION WAS \"TRUSTING TRUMP.\" EVEN AFTER CONTRACTING THE VIRUS HIMSELF, DONALD TRUMP STILL REFUSED TO PROMOTE UNIVERSAL MASK WEARING, WHICH COULD HAVE SAVED OVER 1000 AMERICAN LIVES, AND COULD STILL SAVE OVER WHENEVER THOUSAND AMERICAN LIVES IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THE LONGER DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENT, THE MORE RECKLESS HE GETS. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE HELD PRISONER BY THIS ADMINISTRATION'S FAILURES. WE CAN CHOOSE A DIFFERENT PATH. WE CAN COME TOGETHER WITH , WITH WHAT AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE, COME TOGETHER WITH GREAT PASSION AND DETERMINATION. I WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT I PLANNED TO DO IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING ELECTED YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT. I WILL IMMEDIATELY PUT IN PLACE A NATIONAL STRATEGY TO POSITION OUR COUNTRY TO FINALLY GET AHEAD OF THIS VIRUS, AND GET BACK OUR LIVES. I WILL REACH OUT TO EVERY GOVERNOR IN EVERY STATE, RED AND BLUE, AS WELL AS MAYORS AND LOCAL OFFICIALS, DURING TRANSITION, TO FIND OUT WHAT SUPPORT THEY NEED AND HOW MUCH OF IT THEY NEED. I WILL ASK THE NEW CONGRESS TO PUT A BILL ON MY DESK BY THE END OF JANUARY, WITH ALL THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO SEE HOW BOTH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RESPONSE CAN BE SEEN THROUGH THE END, WHAT IS NEEDED. LOOK, A PANDEMIC DOESN'T PLAY FAVORITES, NOR DO I. AS I SAID, NO RED STATES, NO BLUE STATES, JUST THE UNITED STATES, UNITED IN OUR SPOTS, UNITED IN OUR PURPOSE TO STOP THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 AND BEAT THIS VIRUS. FIRST, I WILL GO TO EVERY GOVERNOR TO GET A MASK MANDATE IN THEIR STATE SAID IF THEY REFUSE, I WILL GO TO CITY AND COUNTY EXECUTIVES TO GET LOCAL MASK MANDATES IN PLACE NATIONWIDE. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL MANDATE MASK WEARING AN ALL FEDERAL BUILDINGS AND INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION, BECAUSE MASKS SAVE LIVES. PERIOD. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN ARIZONA. THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR INITIALLY TRIED TO BAR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM INITIATING MASK MANDATES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WHAT HAPPENED? IN JUNE, ARIZONA ENTERED A SURGE OF CASES, HOSPITALS WERE FLOODED. THE STATE HEALTH SYSTEM WAS OVERWHELMED. CITIES AND COUNTIES APPEALED THE GOVERNOR'S RULING. THEY IMPOSED THEIR OWN LOCAL MANDATES, COVERING MOST OF THE STATE. THE RESULT? CASES FELL BY 75%. WEARING A MASK IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT, IT IS A SCIENTIFIC IMPERATIVE. IT IS A POINT OF PATRIOTIC PRIDE, SO WE CAN PULL OUR COUNTRY OUT OF THIS GOD-AWFUL SPIRAL THAT WE ARE IN. IT IS A TESTAMENT OF WHAT WE WERE TAUGHT BY OUR FAMILIES AND BY OUR FAITH, LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF. SECOND, I WILL PUT A NATIONAL TESTING PLAN IN PLACE WITH THE GOAL OF TESTING AS MANY PEOPLE EACH DAY AS WE ARE CURRENTLY TESTING EACH WEEK, A SEVEN-FOLD INCREASE. THERE IS A KEY DIFFERENCE IN THIS CAMPAIGN BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND ME. I BELIEVE IN TESTING. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT. I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE. I BELIEVE IN PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. I BELIEVE IN THE EXAMPLE OF OTHER COUNTRIES THAT PROVED THAT WIDESPREAD GAINS ARE NEEDED TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY OPEN CRITICALLY, EVERY SCHOOL, EVERY WORKER, EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE EASY ACCESS TO REGULAR, RELIABLE, FREE TESTING. TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE NEED TO INCREASE BOTH LAP-BASED DIAGNOSTIC TESTING WITH RESULTS BACK IN 24 HOURS OR LESS, AND FASTER, CHEAPER SCREENING TESTS THAT YOU COULD TAKE AT HOME OR IN SCHOOL. WE HAVE , WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW ISN'T ANYWHERE NEAR GOOD ENOUGH. STATES ARE STILL OPERATING ON THE FLY. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MOSTLY ON THEIR OWN. AND MANY AMERICANS STILL DON'T KNOW WHEN IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET A TEST, OR HOW. THIS ISN'T BEYOND OUR CAPACITY TO MASTER, NOT IF WE ARE DIRECTING A COORDINATED EFFORT TO CROSS GOVERNMENT ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR, INSTEAD OF LEAVING CHAOS TERRAIN , CHAOS TO REIGN. WE WILL MASS-PRODUCE THE SUPPLIES TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH TESTS AND TAP MORE OF OUR NATION'S LAB CAPACITY, SO THAT YOU CAN GET YOUR TEST RESULTS MORE QUICKLY. WE WILL BUILD A NATIONAL CORPS OF CONTACT TRACERS IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST AT RISK. WE WILL ALSO TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE HAS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GETTING A TEST AND PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND THAT NO ONE, NO ONE IS SCARED THAT BEING TESTED FOR COVID MIGHT JEOPARDIZE THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. THE ONLY WAY WE WILL DEFEAT THIS VIRUS IS IF WE DEFEAT IT EVERYWHERE. THE THIRD POINT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS, WE WILL CLOSE THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, THE PPE GAP, AND GET GEAR OUT TO WHERE IT IS NEEDED. EVERY HEALTH CARE WORKER WILL HAVE A RELIABLE SUPPLY OF PROPERLY-FITTED N95 MASKS. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE THAT MORE THAN EIGHT MONTHS INTO THIS CRISIS, FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE STILL RATIONING THEIR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL USE THE FULL POWER OF THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TO DRIVE THE PRODUCTION OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, MASKS, GOWNS, GLOVES AND MORE, AND ENSURE IT IS DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY. I WON'T STOP UNTIL THE NATION'S SUPPLY EXCEEDS THE DEMAND AND OUR STOCK PILE'S PLAN IS, ESPECIALLY IN HARD-HIT AREAS AND COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE VIRUS. I WILL APPOINT A FULLY-EMPOWERED SUPPLY COMMANDER IN CHARGE OF FEELING IN THE GAPS. WE WILL MAKE SURE WE CAN MANUFACTURE CRITICAL SUPPLIES RIGHT HERE AT HOME, SO WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THIS CRISIS. FOURTH, I WILL PROVIDE CONSISTENT, RELIABLE, TRUSTED, DETAILED NATIONWIDE GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR REOPENING SAFELY, AND THE RESOURCES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. WE NEED A SINGLE SOURCE OF GUIDANCE THAT WE CAN TRUST, WHERE WE KNOW THE INFORMATION WON'T CHANGE FOR ANY REASON, OTHER THAN THE SCIENCE THAT GUIDES IT. NOT POLITICAL LICKS. IN , NOT POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY. NOT PUBLIC IMAGE. SOCIAL DISTANCING IS NOT AN ON AND OFF THING, AND WE LEARN MORE EVERY DAY ABOUT THE VIRUS AND HOW IT SPREADS. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT AND ADJUST OUR BEHAVIOR TO RESPONSIBLY RESPOND APPROPRIATELY. SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES CAN'T MAKE RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION, THE SCIENCE. IT'S NOT JUST MORE DETAILED AND EFFECTIVE GUIDANCE THEY NEED, IT IS CONSULTATIONS AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SO PEOPLE HAVE A PLACE TO TURN WITH THEIR QUESTIONS. IT IS HAVING A GOVERNMENT THAT IT IS IN YOUR CORNER, NOT A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS TURNED ITS BACK ON YOU. AND ONCE WE GOT OUR FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WORKING TOGETHER, ONCE THERE IS UNIVERSAL MASKING, ENOUGH PPE AND TESTING TO GO AROUND, SIGNS-BACKED WRITINGS TO HELP US MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS, THEN WE CAN GET OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL SAFELY, OUR BUSINESS IS GROWING, AND OUR ECONOMY GROWING AGAIN WITHOUT WASTING ANOTHER MINUTE. AS I SAID LAST NIGHT, I AM NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE ECONOMY. I AM NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE COUNTRY. I AM GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE VIRUS. AND FINALLY, WE FOCUS ON DEVELOPING SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS AND A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE. PRESIDENT TRUMP CLAIMS HE FOUND A CURE. YET WE HAVE 1000 PEOPLE DYING EACH DAY. MORE THAN 40,000 PEOPLE ARE IN HOSPITALS RIGHT NOW BATTLING THE VIRUS. LIFESAVING THERAPIES SHOULDN'T JUST BE AVAILABLE TO THE WEALTHY AND WELL-CONNECTED. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY, AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE BECAUSE LEARN ANY DAY THAT ONE OF THESE VACCINES CURRENTLY IN TRIAL IS SHOWING ITSELF TO BE EFFECTIVE. THAT WILL BE A WONDERFUL DAY FOR OUR PEOPLE, AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD EVERYWHERE, WHETHER IT COMES NEXT WEEK OR IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS. BUT IT WILL STILL BE MANY MONTHS BEFORE ANY VACCINE IS WIDELY AVAILABLE, AND WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAKING SURE IT GETS TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY IN A WAY THAT IS EQUITABLE AND THE COMFORTABLE. , EQUITABLE AND ACCOUNTABLE. AND WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO, IN THE MEANTIME, IS DOING HIS JOB TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ONCE WE HAVE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE, IT HAS TO BE FREE TO EVERYONE, WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE INSURED. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. THE VACCINE MUST BE FREE, AND FREELY AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. THIS IS NOT JUST ONE MORE REASON THAT IT IS SO DESPICABLE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS FIGHTING, IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, TO GET THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TO STRIKE DOWN THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH I WORK SO DAMN HARD TO GET THE VOTES FOR. UNDER THE VOTES FOR. UNDER THE ACA, INSURERS ARE REQUIRED TO COVER RECOMMENDED VACCINES FOR FREE. SO OVERTURNING THE ACA WOULD MEAN PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY TO GET THE COVID-19 VACCINE. THAT IS WRONG, VERY, VERY WRONG. UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, I BELIEVE HEALTH CARE ISN'T A PRIVILEGE. I THINK IT IS A RIGHT. THAT IS WHY, AS PRESIDENT I WILL BUILD ON AND PROTECT THE ACA BY ADDING A PUBLIC OPTION THAT WILL COMPETE WITH PRIVATE PLANS TO EXPAND COVERAGE AND LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS ACROSS THE BOARD. I WILL BRING DOWN RUG PRICES BY ALLOWING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE WITH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. I WILL MAKE SURE AMERICANS HAVE INSURANCE, AND THOSE WITH INSURANCE HAVE ACCESS TO FREE COVID-19 VACCINE. AND I WILL DIRECT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BULK PURCHASE AS MANY DOSES AS NECESSARY OF THE COVID-19 VACCINE, SO WE CAN PROVIDE IT FREE TO THOSE WHO ARE UNINSURED, UNDERINSURED, OR MEDICAID ELIGIBLE. THROUGHOUT ALL THIS, YES, MR. PRESIDENT, I WILL LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS. AND I WILL EMPOWER THEM. I KNOW HOW MUCH PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DAMAGED FAITH IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND IN OUR LEADERS IN GOVERNMENT , AND IN OUR LEADERS, AND GOVERNMENT ITSELF. WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE TRUST BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PUBLIC SERVANTS. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TASKS WE FACE IN THE COMING YEARS. IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL ALWAYS GIVE IT TO YOU, AS FDR SAID, STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER. I WILL DELIVER ON MY PROMISES. I WILL LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR POLITICS. I WILL LET DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS SPEAK FREELY, SO YOU CAN MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS POSSIBLE FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY. AND I WON'T LET FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP ROB US OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN QUALITIES, OUR HOPE IN THE FUTURE AND OUR FAITH IN OURSELVES. WE CAN BEAT THIS VIRUS. WE ARE NOT TO DIVIDED TO ACHIEVE BIG THINK , WE ARE NOT TOO DIVIDED TO ACHIEVE BIG THINGS. WE ARE AMERICANS. IMAGINE A TRUE, NATIONALLY-COORDINATED PLAN THAT SPARES NO EXPENSE SO THAT OUR SCHOOLS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO REOPEN WITH FULL HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS IN PLACE. IMAGINE EVERY SMALL BUSINESS GETTING A RESTART THAT HELPS COVER THE COST OF INSTALLING PLEXIGLASS, PPE, AND MINIMIZING THE RISK OF EXPOSURE TO CUSTOMERS AND WORKERS. IMAGINE OLDER AMERICANS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HAVING THE PEACE OF MIND THAT COMES WITH TRUSTING THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM IS WORKING FOR THEM. IMAGINE, INSTEAD OF STAYING LOCKED IN THEIR ROOMS, THEY ARE ABLE TO HUG THEIR GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS THAT THEY LOVE AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE. IMAGINE IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN HIT PARTICULARLY HARD, BLACK, LATINO, ASIAN AMERICAN, NATIVE AMERICAN, IMAGINE A PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RESPONSE THAT TREATS YOUR NEEDS AS A PRIORITY, NOT AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT. AND I JUNE 8 A IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE , AND IMAGINE A DAY IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE WHEN YOU CAN ENJOY A DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR FAMILY AND MAYBE GO TO A MOVIE, WHEN YOU CAN CELEBRATE YOUR BIRTHDAY, WEDDINGS, ACTUATIONS, SURROUNDED BY YOUR NEAREST AND DEAREST FRIENDS. THAT IS THE BIDEN-HARRIS AGENDA TO BEACH COVID-19. IT IS GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER, AND THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE, ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER, WATCHING OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO WEAR A MASK, AND PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING A Y LONGER. IT IS GOING TO BE HARD. BUT IF WE FOLLOW THE SCIENCE AND KEEP FAITH IN ONE ANOTHER, WITH ONE ANOTHER, I PROMISE YOU WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS AND COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE MUCH FASTER THAN THE RATE WE ARE GOING NOW. YOU ALL KNOW THIS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN THEIR BEST TO THIS COUNTRY IN TIMES OF CRISIS, AND THIS TIME ISN'T ANY DIFFERENT. I'M NOT JOKING WHEN I SAY THIS, I THINK EVERY DAY ABOUT THE BRAVE DOCTORS AND NURSES AND HOSPITAL WORKERS, POLICE OFFICERS, FIREFIGHTERS, EMTS AND OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS. THEY ARE NOT FIGURATIVELY, BUT LITERALLY PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE DAY IN AND THEY OUT TO CARE FOR PEOPLE. I'M THINKING OF THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO CARRIED THE REST OF US ON THEIR SHOULDERS THROUGH THESE MANY MONTHS, GROCERY CLERKS, DELIVERY CLERKS, DRIVERS, FOLKS ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE, THE MEATPACKERS AND SO MANY MORE PEOPLE TOO OFTEN OVERLOOKED, TOO OFTEN OVERLOOKED, UNDER COMPENSATED, HAVE GIVEN THE BEST OF THEIR COUNTRY , HAVE GIVEN THE BEST TO THEIR COUNTRY WHEN WE NEEDED IT THE MOST. THINK OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO MOVED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND KEEP THEIR BUSINESS IS OPEN, AND SADLY, OF ALL THOSE WHO COULDN'T BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET THE HELP THEY WERE PROMISED. I THINK OF THE PARENTS WORKING FROM HOME WITH ADDED MAN'S OF OVERSEEING THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION. I THINK ABOUT EDUCATORS WHO ARE SPENDING HOURS LEARNING HOW TO TEACH ONLINE. THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO, GIVING ABOVE AND BEYOND FOR THEIR STUDENTS. I THINK OF THE FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES WHO STEPPED UP, DONATING TO CHARITIES, DOING GROCERY RUNS FOR OLDER RELATIVES AND NEIGHBORS, FINDING NEW WAYS TO CONNECT AND SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER. THAT IS THE AMERICA THAT WE KNOW. THAT IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT IS WHO WE ARE. AND LIKE JOHN F. KENNEDY, WHEN HE COMMITTED TO TAKE US TO THE MOON, HE SAID, I REFUSED TO POSTPONE THE POSSIBILITIES THAT EXIST FOR THIS COUNTRY. I REFUSE TO POSTPONE THE AMERICAN PURPOSE THAT WILL NOT ONLY LEAD OUR COUNTRY BACK, BUT LEAD THE ENTIRE WORLD. THERE IS NO CHALLENGE, THERE IS NO CHALLENGE WE CANNOT MEET, NO ENEMY WE ARE UNABLE TO FACE, NO THREAT WE CAN'T CONQUER IF WE STAND TOGETHER, UNITED, BOUND BY OUR COMMON RESOLVE, DETERMINATION AND VALUES. FOLKS, TOGETHER WE CAN HARNESS THE UNLIMITED POTENTIAL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NOT JUST TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE THIS VIRUS, BUT TO GET BACK BETTER. I PROMISE YOU, AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR HEART, WE CAN DO THIS. WE MUST DO THIS. AND WE WILL DO IT TOGETHER. YOU KNOW WE CAN DO IT. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR FRONT-LINE WORKERS AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE. THANK YOU, AND KEEP THE FAITH.

WE ARE MAKING THE ROUNDS. IT JUST FEELS GOOD. WHEN I WENT TO IRELAND, I KEPT SAYING TO THE PRESIDENT, EVERY TIME THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD COME, WE WOULD SIT IN THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. FINALLY ONE DAY, THEY SAID, WHY DON'T YOU COME TO IRELAND? AND THEY SAID IT IS A LAND OF 100,000 WELCOMES. I HAD TO GO BACK ON BUSINESS AND WE WENT BACK AND THEY DID A WHOLE GENEALOGY OF MY FAMILY. I DON'T WANT TO HURT HER REPUTATION, BUT I THINK WE ARE RELATED. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR FAMILY HAILS FROM. WITH H1N1, IT WAS , [INDISCERNIBLE] NO PANIC, NO ANY OF THAT. BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IT WAS BARACK , I KNOW YOU SAW HIM IN PHILLY, BUT HE'S A GOOD FRIEND. BUT THE POINT IS, THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERTS SAID LOOK, THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THERE ARE A LOT MORE COMMUNICABLE DISEASES TRANSMITTED THAT YOU CAN'T BUILD A WALL HIGH ENOUGH. AND PANDEMICS ARE GOING TO BE CAUSED. SO WE SET UP AN OFFICE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND WE HIRED PEOPLE, WE PUT PEOPLE , EXPERTS FROM THE CDC AND OTHER AREAS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE WOULD PUT THEM IN OTHER COUNTRIES SO YOU WOULD SEE IT COMING. WE HAD 34 PEOPLE IN CHINA. AND TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE , HE NEVER ASKED THEM TO GO INTO WUHAN TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST , HOW BAD THE SITUATION WAS. AND REMEMBER, HE WAS PRAISING THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA, PRESIDENT XI. FROM THE BEGINNING, IT IS CLEAR. WE WILL BE COVID, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH FUTURE PANDEMICS. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST BEAT IT IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU HAVE TO GO BEYOND THAT. PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE HISTORY WITH COURT PACKING. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE ALREADY PACKED THE LOWER COURTS AND ARE ALREADY DOING THAT? [INDISCERNIBLE] WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT , BY THE WAY, I THINK YOU ARE ASKING LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS. WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, BECAUSE OF YOUR HARD WORK, IF I AM ELECTED, WE WILL SET UP A COMMISSION. A CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR, LIBERAL SCHOLARS, AND MAINSTREAM SCHOLARS. YOU CAN HAVE THEM DO AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT, IF ANY, CHANGES SHOULD TAKE PLACE. HOW LONG TO STAY IN COURTS, IF THERE IS A CONTROLLER. AND WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS THE SUPREME COURT. THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF THINGS. BUT HERE IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF COURT PACKING OR SAYING THAT WE ARE GOING TO ADD X NUMBER. BUT WE LISTENED TO ALL IDEAS BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME THE SILLIEST QUESTION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 21ST CENTURY. A LOT OF SCHOLARS ARE CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVES TO HOW THE PRESIDENT PROCEEDS. AND I ASKED THEM TO REPORT BACK TO ME AS SOON AS WE ARE ELECTED IN 180 DAYS AND WE WILL DECIDE WHAT WE ARE DOING. MORE QUESTIONS, YOU ARE A PAIN IN THE NECK. THIS GUY. [LAUGHTER] BUT HERE IS. , BUT HERE IS THE DEAL. ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT , [SHOUTING] [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. FOLKS, HOW ARE YOU? THANKS. WE ARE GLAD TO BE HERE. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LOOK, YESTERDAY, THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF MARK MEADOWS WENT ON TELEVISION TO ADMIT TO THE COUNTRY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WASN'T EVEN TRYING ANYMORE TO DEAL WITH THE PANDEMIC. HE SAID, AND I QUOTE, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. THE WASHINGTON POST HEADLINE TODAY SAYS WHITE HOUSE GIVES UP ON TRYING TO SLOW VIRUS SPREAD. NO CAVEATS. JUST A DEADLY ADMISSION. EARLIER IN THIS PANDEMIC, TRUMP CALLED HIMSELF A WARTIME PRESIDENT. FIGHTING A WAR AGAINST AN INVISIBLE ENEMY. I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR MONTHS, AS YOU WELL KNOW, THAT HE WAVED THE WHITE FLAG ALL THE WAY BACK THEN. HE WASN'T DOING MUCH AT ALL. SOME PEOPLE SAID I WAS BEING HARSH OR UNFAIR. THE WHITE HOUSE IS COMING OUT RIGHT NOW AND ADMITTING WHAT I SAID MONTHS AGO WAS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. LOOK AT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE DEAD. 220,000. IT IS EXPECTED AS MANY AS ANOTHER 200,000 COULD DIE BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR. AND HE SAID, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL IT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, DONALD TRUMP IS THE WORST POSSIBLE PRESIDENT, THE WORST POSSIBLE PERSON TO TRY TO LEAD US TO THIS PANDEMIC. HE EITHER DOESN'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT TO DO OR HE JUST DOESN'T CARE. ON FRIDAY, DR. FAUCI, THE NATION'S MOST RESPECTED INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT MET WITH HIS COVID TEAM FOR MONTHS. EVEN WORSE, SATURDAY, DONALD TRUMP SAID THE COVID-19 COUNT WASN'T REALLY GOING UP. EVERYTHING WAS LEVELING OUT. HE SUGGESTED THE DOCTORS WERE INFLATING THE NUMBERS, CATCH THIS, BECAUSE DOCTORS GET MORE MONEY. WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH THIS MAN? DOCTORS AND NURSES HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES TRYING TO SAVE LIVES. AND HE SAYS THE REASON THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT TESTING IS THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY. MR. PRESIDENT, MORE THAN 1000 HEALTH-CARE WORKERS LOST THEIR LIVES FIGHTING COVID. DOCTORS, NURSES. THEY ARE NOT PROFITING. THEY ARE DYING. BUT REMEMBER, DURING THE DEBATE IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT, DURING THE DEBATE, TRUMP SAID THAT WE ARE LEARNING TO LIVE WITH THIS COVID. HE'S ASKING US TO LEARN TO DIE WITH IT. FOLKS, THIS HAS GOT TO END. WE CAN AND THIS CRISIS. IF WE WOULD ONLY GET TOGETHER WITH THE HOUSE AND SENATE AND WORK OUT A COMPROMISE ON THE SPENDING BILLS OUT THERE. IT THAT WAY WE CAN SAFELY OPEN SCHOOLS. IT WILL COST $200 BILLION TO DO IT. BUT IT IS WORTH DOING IT. WE CAN LOWER CLASS SIZES, MORE TEACHERS, VENTILATION, PPE, MASKS, GLOVES, SANITATION. ALL THE BUSINESSES TO BE ABLE TO OPEN IF WE PROVIDED THE HELP WE SAID WE WOULD DO. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO DO. TESTING AND TRACING. WE SHOULD BE POURING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO HOW WE GET RAPID TESTING SO THAT YOU KNOW WITHIN HOURS WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE TESTED NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE. MANY PLACES YOU HAVE TO WAIT, SOMETIMES UP TO SIX DAYS OR SEVEN DAYS. AND LOOK, FOLKS. I PROMISE YOU THIS. I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP. YOU KNOW, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SHAME. JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SHAME. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DYING. MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE. AS MANY AS 200,000 IS SUGGESTED BY SOME. BUT AS POINTED OUT, IF WE JUST WORE A MASK AND KEPT SOCIAL DISTANCING AND GOT TESTED, WE CAN SAVE BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR OVER 100,000 AMERICAN LIVES. WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE UP. AT THE RATE HE'S GOING, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE GOOD. BY THE WAY, I AM HAPPY TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS FROM THE PRESS. BUT LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR, I'M NOT SHUTTING DOWN OIL FIELDS AND I'M NOT ELIMINATING RACKING. I'M INVESTING IN CLEAN ENERGY AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE TO SUBSIDIZE POLLUTION. THEY GET SOMEWHERE BETWEEN $25 BILLION AND $40 BILLION IN SUBSIDIES. THAT MONEY SHOULD GO TO DOING A LOT OF OTHER GOOD THINGS. BY THE WAY, I TRAVELED THE LAST FEW DAYS. I'VE TOLD YOU WHERE I WILL BE TRAVELING. I WILL BE GOING TO IOWA, WISCONSIN, GEORGIA, FLORIDA, AND MAYBE OTHER PLACES AS WELL. THERE'S A LOT WE'VE BEEN DOING AS WELL IN TERMS OF BEING ONLINE AND EVERYTHING FROM FUNDRAISING EFFORTS TO MAKING SURE , I MET TODAY WITH A GROUP OF LEADERS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY LAYING OUT WHERE WE WILL GO. CONSTANTLY, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A DAY THAT HASN'T BEEN A 12 HOUR DAY AT. LOOK, YOU KNOW ME. I AM NOT OVERCONFIDENT ABOUT ANYTHING. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN EARN EVERY VOTE POSSIBLE. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE. AND YOU KNOW THAT IT HAS TO BE REESTABLISHED. BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I WILL WIN PENNSYLVANIA. IT IS A GREAT DEAL TO ME PERSONALLY AS WELL AS POLITICALLY. I THINK WE WILL WIN MICHIGAN. I THINK WE WILL WIN WISCONSIN. I THINK WE WILL WIN MINNESOTA. I THINK WE HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE IN NORTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, IOWA. BECAUSE OF OVER 6 MILLION INDIVIDUAL VOTERS, THE AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION OF $49, WE ARE ABLE TO COMPETE LIKE WE HAVE BEFORE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRAVEL. THE REASON WHY IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE NOT TRAVELING AS WE ARE NOT PUTTING ON SUPER SPREADERS. WE ARE DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE. EVERYBODY IS WEARING A MASK AND TRYING TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO BE SOCIALLY DISTANT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE. NO, NO, NO. IT IS A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT AND I'M NOT GOING TO ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THAT AT ALL. THERE IS SOME LITERATURE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF GOING FROM ONE COURT TO ANOTHER COURT, NOT JUST STAYING THE WHOLE TIME ON THE SUPREME COURT. BUT I HAVE MADE NO JUDGMENT. IT IS JUST A GROUP OF SERIOUS SCHOLARS THAT HAVE A NUMBER OF IDEAS HOW WE SHOULD PROCEED FROM THIS POINT ON. WE WILL GIVE THEM 180 DAYS, GOD WILLING, IF I AM ELECTED, TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SUCH A RECOMMENDATION. LOOK, YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN, ALL PARENTS ARE TAUGHT THAT THE EXAMPLE YOU SET IMPACTS ON HOW YOUR KID REACTS. THE EXAMPLE YOU SET MATTERS TO THE REST OF THE COMPANY. THE WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE ACTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT MATTER. THEY MATTER A GREAT DEAL. AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PUTS ON THESE SUPER SPREADER EVENTS, YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SHE WAS ANNOUNCED. ALL THE PEOPLE, INCLUDING HIS FAMILY, THANK GOD THEY SEEM TO BE OK. ALL PEOPLE CAME DOWN WITH COVID. , ALL THE PEOPLE THAT CAME DOWN WITH COVID. I'M JUST HOPING THAT HE CAN LEARN A LESSON. I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR CELEBRATING. THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS WE COULD BE DOING. BUT IT IS JUST NOT APPROPRIATE NOW. I HOPE HE AND THE VICE PRESIDENT AND OTHERS ACT WITH SOME DISPATCH AND DO WHAT EVERYBODY KNOWS. PEOPLE SHOULD BE TESTED FIRST BEFORE THEY EVEN SHOW UP. NUMBER TWO, THEY SHOULD BE WEARING MASKS. NUMBER THREE, THEY SHOULD BE SOCIALLY DISTANCED. NUMBER FOUR, IT SHOULD NOT BE A HUGE CROWD, WHETHER IT IS OUTSIDE OR NOT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

NEXT, JOE BIDEN HOLDING A CAMPAIGN EVENT WITH VOTERS AND SUPPORTERS IN WARM SPRINGS, GEORGIA. HOME OF FDR'S LITTLE WHITE HOUSE. HE TALKED ABOUT UNITY AMONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DURING THIS 25 MINUTE EVENT. (music) HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. WHAT A MAGNIFICENT SETTING. IT'S HARD WHEN YOU DRIVE IN HERE NOT TO THINK OF CIRCUMSTANCES PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT FACED AND HOW HE OVERCAME SO MUCH FOR SO MANY. GOOD AFTERNOON. A FEW WEEKS AGO I SPOKE AT GETTYSBURG ABOUT THE NEED TO UNITE OUR NATION. TODAY, I'M HERE IN WARM SPRINGS BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO HEAL OUR NATION. OVER THESE PAST FEW MONTHS THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH PAIN AND SO MUCH SUFFERING, AND SO MUCH LOSS IN AMERICA. OVER 225,000 PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO A VIRUS. MANY OF THOSE LIVES LOST IN THE CRUELEST WAY POSSIBLE. ALONE. ALONE. ALONE IN A HOSPITAL ROOM. ALONE IN A NURSING HOME. NO FAMILY, NO FRIENDS, NO LOVED ONES BESIDE THEM IN THOSE FINAL MOMENTS. IT HAUNTS SO MANY OF THE SURVIVING FAMILIES. FAMILIES WHO ARE NEVER GIVEN A CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE. I, AND MANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT LOSS FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU LOSE SOMEONE YOU LOVE. HE FEEL THAT DEEP BLACK HOLE OPENING UP IN YOUR CHEST. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE BEING SWALLOWED INTO IT. THE TRAGIC TRUTH OF OUR TIME IS THAT COVID HAS LEFT A DEEP AND LASTING WOUND IN THIS COUNTRY. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS, AND WE SEE THE EMPTY STOREFRONTS IN THE SHUTTERED BUSINESSES. THE VISIBLE SIGNS OF LOST HOPES AND BROKEN DREAMS. BUT WHAT WE DON'T SEE IS ALL THOSE PARENTS STARING AT THE CEILING LATE AT NIGHT WONDERING, HOW AM I GOING TO PAY THE MORTGAGE? HOW AM I GOING TO PAY OUR RENT? WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO IF ONE OF MY KIDS GET SICK NOW THAT I'VE LOST MY HEALTH INSURANCE. GROWING UP, LIKE MANY OF YOU, I WATCHED MY FATHER STRUGGLED TO FIND WORK. HE MADE WHAT I CALLED THE LONGEST WALK ANY PARENT COULD MAKE UP A SHORT FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO HIS CHILDREN'S BEDROOM TO TELL A CHILD YOU CANNOT PLAY ON THAT LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM ANYMORE. YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO THE SAME SCHOOL. WE CAN'T STAY HERE, JOEY, WE CAN'T STAY IN SCRANTON ANYMORE. WE HAVE TO MOVE. THERE ARE GOOD JOBS IN DELAWARE. WHEN I GET ONE I WILL COME BACK FOR YOU, YOUR SISTER, YOUR BROTHER AND YOUR MOM. ONLY 157 MILES AWAY, JOEY. MY FATHER CAME HOME EVERY WEEKEND FOR THAT YEAR, BUT HE ALWAYS SAID WHEN WE FINALLY GOT SETTLED IN DELAWARE, HE USED TO SAY, JOBS ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. MY SISTER HEARD IT AS WELL, VALERIE. HE SAID, IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT, IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND RIGHT NOW, IN THIS AUTUMN AFTERNOON, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY FEEL THEY HAVE LOST ALL THAT. A SEASON OF PROTEST HAS BROKEN OUT ALL ACROSS THE NATION. SOME OF IT IS SENSELESS BURNING, LOOTING AND VIOLENCE THAT CAN'T BE TOLERATED AND WON'T. BUT MUCH OF IT IS A CRY FOR JUSTICE. FROM A COMMUNITY THAT HAS LONG HAD A KNEE OF INJUSTICE ON THEIR NECK. THE NAMES OF GEORGE FLOYD, BREONNA TAYLOR, JACOB BLAKE. NOT FORGOTTEN BY ME, NOT BY US AND NOT BY THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO INSPIRE A NEW WAY OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA. THESE ARE HISTORIC, PAINFUL CRISES. THE INSIDIOUS VIRUS, THE ECONOMIC ANGUISH, THE SYSTEMATIC DISSEMINATION. AND ONE OF THEM COULD HAVE ROCKED THE NATION, ANY ONE OF THEM, YET, WE HAVE BEEN HIT BY ALL THREE ONCE. THE PAIN IS STRIKING AT THE HEART OF ALL OF OUR COUNTRY AND GOES BACK NOT MONTHS, BUT YEARS. OUR POLITICS FOR TOO LONG HAVE BEEN MEAN, BITTER AND DIVISIVE. YOU CAN HEAR IT NOW IN THE DISTANCE. WE HAVE STOPPED SEEING DIGNITY AND ONE ANOTHER. WE STOPPED SHOWING ONE ANOTHER RESPECT. TOO MANY AMONG US SPEND MORE TIME SHOUTING THAN LISTENING. MORE TIME FIGHTING BEEN WORKING TOGETHER. MORE TIME DEMONIZING BEEN , MORE TIME DEMONIZING OTHERS AND LIFTING THEM UP. THE DIVISIONS IN OUR NATION ARE GETTING WIDER. ANGRY PEOPLE UPSET. ANGER AND SUSPICION ARE GROWING. OUR WOUNDS ARE GETTING DEEPER. MANY WONDER, HAS IT GONE TOO FAR? HAVE WE PASSED THE POINT OF NO RETURN? HAS THE HEART OF THIS NATION TURNED TO STONE? I DON'T THINK SO. I REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT. I KNOW THIS COUNTRY. I KNOW OUR PEOPLE. I KNOW WE CAN UNITE AND HEAL THIS NATION. WARM SPRINGS IS A GOOD PLACE TO TALK ABOUT HOPE AND HEALING. FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT CAME TO USE THE \"THERAPEUTIC WATERS\" TO REBUILD HIMSELF. STRICKEN BY THE POLIO IN 1921, HE SUFFERED FROM PARALYSIS. LIKE MANY OTHER AMERICANS IN THOSE PRE-VACCINE DECADES, FDR LONGED TO LIVE AN INDEPENDENT LIFE. A LIFE THAT WAS NOT DEFINED BY HIS ILLNESS. TO HIM, AND TO SO MANY OTHERS FACING PHYSICAL CHALLENGES, WARM SPRINGS OFFERED THERAPY FOR THE BODY, AND I MIGHT ADD, AND THE SOUL. BUT IT OFFERED SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL. FDR CAME LOOKING FOR A CURE. BUT IT WAS THE LESSONS HE LEARNED HERE THAT HE USED TO LIFT A NATION. HUMILITY, EMPATHY, COURAGE, OPTIMISM. THIS PLACE REPRESENTED A WAY FORWARD. A WAY OF RESTORATION, RESILIENCE AND HEALING. AS YEARS HAVE FOLLOWED, FDR HAD COME BACK TO WARM SPRINGS OFTEN. THINK ABOUT HOW TO HEAL THE NATION AND THE WORLD. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID. LIFTING US OUT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. DEFEATING TYRANNY, SAVING DEMOCRACY. THEN IT WAS HERE, ON APRIL 12, 1945 THAT PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT DIED. A CASUALTY OF WAR AS SURELY AS ANY WHO FELL IN COMBAT. AND THE FREE WORLD MOURNED. AMERICAN LEADERS WEPT. MAYBE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, WAS REACTION TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NAVAL CHIEF PETTY OFFICER GRAHAM JACKSON, A BLACK MAN, CRIED AS HE PLAYED HIS ACCORDION AND TRIBUTE TO FDR NOT FAR FROM HERE. AND THE STORY IS TOLD, THAT WHEN FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT FUNERAL WENT BY, A MAN COLLAPSED AND GRIEF. THE NEIGHBOR ASKED HIM, DID YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT? HIS RESPONSE WAS, NO, THE MAN SAID, BUT HE KNEW ME. HE KNEW ME. FEW WORDS BETTER DESCRIBE THE KIND OF PRESIDENT OUR NATION NEEDS RIGHT NOW. A PRESIDENT WHO IS NOT IN IT FOR HIMSELF, BUT FOR OTHERS. A PRESIDENT THAT DOES NOT DIVIDE US, BUT UNITES US. A PRESIDENT WHO APPEALS NOT TO THE WORST IN US, BUT TO THE BEST. A PRESIDENT WHO CARES LESS ABOUT HIS TV RATINGS AND MORE ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. A PRESIDENT WHO LOOKS NOT TO SETTLE SCORES, BUT TO FIND SOLUTIONS. A PRESIDENT GUIDED NOT BY WISHFUL THINKING, BUT BY FACT. THAT IS THE KIND OF PRESIDENT I HOPE TO BE. I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT. I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT SUPPORT ME AS FOR THOSE WHO DO. THAT IS THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT. A DUTY OF CARE FOR EVERYONE. THIS PLACE, WARM SPRINGS, IS A REMINDER THAT THOUGH BROKEN, EACH OF US CAN BE HEALED. THAT AS A PEOPLE AND A COUNTRY, WE CAN OVERCOME THIS DEVASTATING VIRUS. THAT WE CAN HEAL A SUFFERING WORLD. AND YES, WE CAN RESTORE OUR SOUL AND SAVE OUR COUNTRY. THESE LAST HOURS, PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT WAS AT WORK ON A SPEECH THAT WAS TO BE DELIVERED THE NEXT DAY. HE WAS TO SAY QUOTE, TODAY, WE MUST CULTIVATE THE SCIENCE OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS, THE ABILITY OF ALL PEOPLE OF ALL KINDS TO LIVE TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER IN THE SAME WORLD AT PEACE. TO LIVE TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER. THAT IS HOW I SEE AMERICA. THAT IS HOW I SEE THE PRESIDENCY. THAT IS HOW I SEE THE FUTURE. I TELL YOU THIS FROM MY HEART. I BELIEVE AMERICA , I BELIEVE IN AMERICAN HOPE, NOT FEAR. UNITY, NOT DIVISION. LOVE, NOT HATE. THE PRESIDENCY THOUGH IS ONLY ONE PART OF THE AMERICAN COURSE. HISTORY IS NOT ONLY A STORY OF THE GREAT AND FAMOUS. OUR HISTORY IS A STORY OF WE THE PEOPLE. OF ALL OF US TOGETHER. I HAVE LONG SAID THE STORY OF AMERICA IS A STORY OF ORDINARY PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. CHANGING OUR COUNTRY , CHANGE IN OUR COUNTRY COMES WHEN THE VOICES OF THE POWERLESS REACH THE YEARS OF THE POWERFUL. WHEN THOSE WHOSE NAMES WE WILL NEVER KNOW RISK THEIR LIVES IN THE WORDS OF DR. KING, THEN THE ARK OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE TOWARD , BEND THE ARC OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE FOR JUSTICE. BENDING THAT ARC IS THE WORK TOWARD TIME. IT WILL TAKE ALL OF US. RED STATES, BLUE STATES, REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS. I BELIEVE IN THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART WE CAN DO IT. PEOPLE ASK ME, WHY ARE YOU SO CONFIDENT, JOE? BECAUSE WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOTHING, NOTHING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CANNOT DO. THE NEWS OF FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT'S DEATH WENT OUT ON THE WIRES. AN EDITOR IN CHICAGO TRYING TO HIS COLLEAGUE AND SAID, CLEAR THE DECKS FOR ACTION. I SAY TO YOU TODAY, IF YOU GIVE ME THE HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR PRESIDENT, CLEAR THE DECKS FOR ACTION FOR WE WILL ACT. WE WILL ACT ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY PRESIDENCY TO GET COVID UNDER CONTROL. WE WILL ACT TO PASS AN ECONOMIC PLAN THAT WILL FINALLY REWARD WORK, NOT WEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY. WE WILL ACT TO PASS MY HEALTH CARE PLAN TO PROVIDE AN ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN AND DRUG PRICES THAT ARE GENETICALLY LOWER. WE WILL ACT TO PASS THE BITING CLIMATE PLAN TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF A CLIMATE CRISIS WHILE CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD PAY, HIGH-PAYING LABOR JOBS. WE WILL ACT TO ADDRESS , WE WILL ACT TO GIVE WORKING PEOPLE A SHOT AGAIN. WE WILL ACT TO RESTORE OUR FAITH IN DEMOCRACY AND OUR FAITH IN ONE ANOTHER. TODAY, WE ARE FACING A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS. WITH WINTER AT HAND, IT IS GETTING WORSE. JUST LAST FRIDAY, 83,000 NEW CASES IN ONE DAY. SATURDAY, ANOTHER 83,000 CASES. NEARLY 1000 PEOPLE A DAY ARE DYING. ANOTHER 200,000 DEATHS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS. AND THE PRESIDENT KEEPS TELLING US NOT TO WORRY. HE KEEPS TELLING US WE ARE TURNING THE CORNER. HE SAYS , IT IS AS REMOVED FROM REALITY AND AS REMOVED FROM REALITY AND IS OFFENSIVE WHEN HE TOLD US THE VIRUS AFFECTS VIRTUALLY NOBODY, JUST THE ELDERLY WITH HEART CONDITIONS. VIRTUALLY NOBODY. JUST THE ELDERLY WITH HEART CONDITIONS. AS IF THEY DO NOT MATTER. WHAT HE SAID IN RESPONSE TO THE NUMBER OF DEATHS REACHING 1000, HE SAID IT IS WHAT IT IS. IT IS WHAT IT IS BECAUSE HE IS WHO HE IS. IN THE SPRING, THE PRESIDENT DECLARED IN HIS VOICE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF. HE WAS GOING TO WAGE WAR ON THE VIRUS. INSTEAD, HE SHRUGGED, HE SWAGGERED AND HE SURRENDERED. HIS CHIEF OF STAFF LAST WEEK MADE A STUNNING ADMISSION. AN ADMISSION THAT I BELIEVE BUT NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD SAY SAYING QUOTE, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC, END OF QUOTE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. IT IS A CAPITULATION. IT IS THE WAIVING OF A WHITE FLAG. IT IS A WINDOW INTO THE SHOCKING TRUTH ABOUT THIS WHITE HOUSE, THAT THEY HAVE NEVER REALLY TRIED. THINK ABOUT ALL THE FRONTLINE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE REST AND SOME GIVEN THEIR LIVES FOR THE LAST NINE MONTHS OF THIS PANDEMIC. THINK ABOUT ALL THE FIRST RESPONDERS. THINK ABOUT ALL THE GROCERY STORE CLERKS, THE DRIVERS, THE DELIVERY DRIVERS OF TRUCKS. TEACHERS, PARENTS AND THE KIDS HOME FROM SCHOOL. THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS. THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY THE VIRUS. THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE WHO HAVE DIED. THEY WERE GIVING THEIR ALL WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS GIVING UP. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU WE CAN AND WE WILL CONTROL THIS VIRUS. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL NEVER WAIVE THE WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER. JUST IMAGINE WHERE WE WOULD BE TODAY IF THE PRESIDENT HAD EMBRACED WEARING MASKS INSTEAD OF MOCKING IT. IMAGINE WHERE WE WOULD BE TODAY IF THE PRESIDENT HAD PRACTICED SOCIAL DISTANCING INSTEAD OF HOLDING SUPER-SPREADER FEARS VENCE SUPER-SPREADER FEARS VENCE. IMAGINE WHERE WE WOULD BE IF THERE WAS A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF TESTING AND TRACING. I FIRST PUT FORWARD A DETAILED PLAN ON HOW TO DEAL WITH HIS VIRUS BACK IN MARCH. THIS ADMINISTRATION IGNORED IT. I RELEASED SEVERAL MORE DETAILED PLANS IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED. THE MOST RECENT JUST LAST WAKE. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS YET TO OFFER A SINGLE PLAN. IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS MEDICAL JOURNALS IN THE WORLD, THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE CALLED THE PRESIDENT, DANGEROUSLY INCOMPETENT AND WENT ON TO SAY THE PRESIDENT TURNED A CRISIS INTO A TRAGEDY. I AM READY TO ACT. I KNOW WHAT TO DO. STARTING ON DAY ONE OF MY PRESIDENCY, WE WILL DO IT. I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS CAMPAIGN. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR IN THESE CLOSING DAYS ABOUT WHAT I MEAN AND ABOUT WHAT I INTEND TO DO IN THAT BATTLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR BETTER ANGELS PREVAIL OVER OUR WORST INSTINCTS. I BELIEVE THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE THE NATION, WHAT WE BELIEVE AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHO WE WANT TO BE. IT IS ABOUT OUR ESSENCE. IT IS ABOUT WHAT MAKES US AMERICANS. IT IS THAT FUNDAMENTAL. TIME AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY, WE HAVE SEEN CHARLATANS, THE CONMEN, THE PHONY POPULISTS WHO SOUGHT TO PLAY ON OUR FEARS, APPEAL TO OUR WORST APPETITES AND PICK AT THE OLDEST SCABS WE HAVE FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL GAIN. THEY APPEAR WHEN THE NATION HAS BEEN HIT THE HARDEST AND WE ARE AT OUR MOST VULNERABLE. NEVER TO SOLVE ANYTHING BUT ONLY TO BENEFIT THEMSELVES. POPE FRANCIS WARNS US AGAINST THIS PHONY POPULISM THAT APPEALS TO QUOTE, THE MOST SELFISH INSTINCTS. HE GOES ON TO SAY POLITICS IS SOMETHING MORE NOBLE THAN POSTURING, MARKETING AND MEDIA SPIN. THESE SEW NOTHING BUT DIVISION, CONFLICT AND CYNICISM. HE SAYS FOR THOSE WHO SEEK TO LEAD, WE WOULD DO WELL TO ASK OURSELVES, WHY AM I DOING THIS? WHY? WHAT IS MY REAL AIM? POPE FRANCIS ASKED THE QUESTION THAT ANYONE WHO SEEKS TO LEAD THIS NATION SHOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER. MY ANSWER IS THIS. I RUN TO UNITE THIS NATION AND TO HEAL THIS NATION. I HAVE SAID THAT FROM THE BEGINNING AS BADLY NECESSARY. THE BIBLE TELLS US THERE IS A TIME TO BREAK DOWN AND A TIME TO BUILD UP. A TIME TO HEAL. THIS IS THAT TIME. GOD IN HISTORY HAVE CALLED US TO THIS MOMENT AND TO THIS MISSION WITH OUR VOICES AND OUR VOTES. WE MUST FREE OURSELVES FROM THE FORCES OF DARKNESS, FROM THE FORCES OF DIVISION, AND THE FORCES OF YESTERDAY. THE FORCES THAT PULL US APART, HOLD US DOWN AND HOLD US BACK. IF WE DO SO, WE WILL ONCE MORE BECOME ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE. A NATION UNITED. A NATION STRENGTHENED. A NATION HEALED. THAT IS MY GOAL. THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING. THAT IS WHAT WE MUST DO. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. STAY SAFE AND WEAR YOUR MASK. [APPLAUSE] (music) I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU MY HEART BECAUSE YOUR SKY FULL OF STARS YOU LIGHT UP DO NOT WANT TO TELL ME I DO NOT CARE YOU ARE A SKY FULL OF STARS (music) (music)","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?477413-1\/joe-biden-remarks-warm-springs-georgia","Summary":"2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered remarks at a campaign event in Warm Springs, Georgia--home of Franklin Delano Roosevelt&rsquo;s \"Little White House\"--on unity among the American people.","Source":"477413-1","Type":"Speech"}

WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT ACTIONS WOULD BE NEEDED TO TURN THIS AROUND AND HOW WE MADE WORSE BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S DECLARATION OF SURRENDER TO THE VIRUS. WE DISCUSSED THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF WEARING MASKS, PROTECTING YOURSELF, PROTECTING YOUR NEIGHBOR AND TO SAVE AROUND 100,000 LIVES IN THE MONTHS AHEAD BETWEEN NOW AND JUST AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR. THIS IS NOT POLITICAL. IT IS PATRIOTIC. WEARING A MASK P, WHERE ONE,ERIOD. WE FOCUSED ON THE WEIGHT THIS VIRUS IS HITTING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, PARTICULAR BLACK, LATINO AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. WE ARE SEEING RACE-BASED DISPARITIES ACROSS THE ASPECT OF THIS VIRUS, HIGHER INFECTION RATES LOWER ACCESS TO TESTING AND HARDER TIME QUARANTINING SAFELY BECAUSE OF THEIR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. LOWER ACCESS TO QUALITY TREATMENT WHEN THEY ARE INFECTED AND TRAGICALLY, HIGHER MORTALITY RATES. ONE IN 1000 BLACK AMERICANS HAVE DIED FROM THIS VIRUS. THIS IS A STAGGERING STATISTIC AND 57% OF BLACK ADULTS, 46% OF LATINO ADULTS KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS DIED OR BEEN HOSPITALIZED BY THIS DISEASE. FOLKS, WE HAVE LOST MORE THAN 220,000 LIVES IN THIS VIRUS ALREADY. BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS GIVEN UP. OVER THE WEEKEND, THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF MARK MEADOWS WENT ON TELEVISION AND ADMITTED THAT THEY WAVE THE WHITE FLAG AND DECLARED SURRENDER. HE SAID, \" WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC.\" THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT IN OMAHA AFTER THE TRUMP RALLY ENDED. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING OLD AMERICANS AND CHILDREN WERE STRANDED IN SUBZERO FREEZING TEMPERATURES FOR HOURS. SEVERAL FOLKS ENDED UP IN THE HOSPITAL. IT'S AN IMAGE THAT CAPTURED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WHOLE APPROACH THIS CRISIS. HE TAKES A LOT OF BIG PRONOUNCEMENTS, HE MAKES A LOT OF BIG PRONOUNCEMENTS BUT THEY DON'T HOLD UP. HE GETS HIS PHOTO OP AND THEN GETS OUT. HE LEAVES EVERYONE ELSE TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIS FAILURE TO MAKE A RESPONSIBLE PLAN. IT SEEMS LIKE HE JUST DOESN'T CARE MUCH ABOUT THEM. THE LONGER HE IS IN CHARGE, THE MORE RECKLESS HE GETS. IT'S ENOUGH. IT'S TIME TO CHANGE. MEANWHILE YESTERDAY, THE WHITE HOUSE SCIENCE OFFICE AND THIS STUNNED ME, PUT OUT A STATEMENT ENDING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS A TOP ACCOMPLISHMENT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST TERM. A TOP ACCOMPLISHMENT OF TRUMP'S FIRST TERM. AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN INFECTION RATES ARE GOING UP IN EVERY STATE IN OUR UNION. REFUSAL OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO RECOGNIZE THE REALITY WE ARE LIVING THROUGH AT A TIME WHEN ALMOST 1000 AMERICANS PER DAY ARE DYING, EVERY SINGLE DAY, IT'S AN INSULT TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON SUFFERING FROM COVID-19 AND EVERY FAMILY WHO HAS LOST A LOVED ONE. THERE IS NOTHING MORE PERSONAL TO AMERICAN FAMILIES THAN THEIR HEALTH CARE AND THE HEALTH CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES. I KNOW ALL TOO WELL WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR HEART RIPPED OUT, LOSING A LOVED ONE TOO SOON, TO SIT IN A HOSPITAL BEDSIDE AND FEEL THERE IS A BLACK HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR CHEST HIM IS NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO. I AND MANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO WATCH A BELOVED PERSON DIE, LIE THERE DYING OF CANCER OR SOME OTHER DISEASE WITHOUT WONDERING , HAVING TO WONDER WHETHER YOU CAN PAY FOR THE MEDICAL BILLS OR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF GOD FOR BID, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE ABLE TO SAY WE WILL NOT COVER THE TREATMENT. AND YET TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ON A SINGLE-MINDED CRUSADE TO STRIP AMERICANS OF THEIR HEALTH CARE. THAT WOULD ONLY CREATE ANOTHER ENORMOUS CRISIS IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. IN TWO SHORT WEEKS, EXACTLY ONE WEEK AFTER THE ELECTION, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL MAKE ITS CASE ASKING THE SUPREME COURT TO STRIKE DOWN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT \" IN ITS ENTIRETY.\" LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. THEIR ARGUMENT THAT THE ENTIRE LAW MUST FALL WHICH WOULD STRIP 20 MILLION AMERICANS OF THEIR HEALTH CARE OVERNIGHT, RIP AWAY PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR MORE THAN 100 MILLION PEOPLE. IN THE MIDDLE OF AN UPSWING IN A PUBLIC PANDEMIC, THE UPSWING. LOOK, JUST THIS WEEK ON 60 MINUTES, WE HEARD WHAT TRUMP TOLD LESLEY STAHL ABOUT THE UPCOMING SUPREME COURT CASE ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND I QUOTE , I HOPE THAT THEY END IT. IT WILL BE SO GOOD IF THE END IT. END OF QUOTE. THERE IS NO QUESTION, THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP NOMINATED JUSTICE BARRETT TO THE COURT. THAT'S WHY THE REPUBLICANS JAMMED HER THROUGH, THE CONFIRMATION IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION. REPUBLICANS TRIED AND TRIED SINCE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS PASSED TO OVERTURN IT AND EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY FAILED. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TRIED EVERYTHING HE CAN ON HIS OWN TO SABOTAGE THE LAW. SO NOW, TO WHAT I CHARACTERIZE AS A BLATANT ABUSE OF POLITICAL POWER, THEY HAVE ADDED TO THE COURT A JUSTICE WHO CRITICIZED CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS'PREVIOUS DECISION TO UPHOLD THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN HOPES THEY CAN DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ONCE AND FOR ALL THROUGH THE COURTS NO MATTER HOW MANY AMERICANS THEY HURT IN THE PROCESS. LET'S REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THE SELECTION. IF YOU HAVE DIABETES, ASTHMA, CANCER OR EVEN COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID-19, YOU WILL LOSE THE PROTECTION THIS LAW PROVIDES. INSURERS WILL ONCE MORE BE ABLE TO JACK UP YOUR PREMIUMS OR DENY YOUR COVERAGE. WOMEN COULD AGAIN BE CHARGE MORE FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN. AND CHILDREN WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO STAY ON THEIR PARENTS INSURANCE POLICIES UNTIL AGE 26. ON TOP OF ALL THAT, OVERTURNING THE ACA COULD MEAN THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO GET COVID-19 VACCINES ONCE IT'S AVAILABLE. THAT'S RIGHT. THE LAW THAT SAYS INSURERS REQUIRE TO COVER THE VACCINE FOR FREE IS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HE'S ATTEMPTING TO STRIKE THAT DOWN. UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, I BELIEVE HEALTH CARE IS A PRIVILEGE, IT'S A RIGHT THAT EVERYONE HAVE ACCESS TO. THIS COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS PRESIDENT WHO THINKS HE IS ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM. WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THE VIRUS, ATTACKED DOCTORS. I CAN'T GET OVER THIS GUY. HE ATTACKED DOCTORS CLAIMING THEY ARE OVERREPORTING COVID CASES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY. DOCTORS ARE OVERREPORTING CASES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE MONEY. YOU KNOW, OUR DOCTORS AND NURSES AND OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE PUTTING THEMSELVES AT ENORMOUS RISK EVERY DAY. MORE THAN 1000 OF THEM HAVE ALREADY DIED. IN AN ATTEMPT TO BEAT BACK THIS PANDEMIC AND SAVE LIVES. THEY DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT BY THEIR PRESIDENT. WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO WOULD RATHER SPEND HIS TIME DESPERATELY TRYING TO STRIP PEOPLE OF THEIR HEALTH CARE THEN EVEN ONCE BOTHER TO PUT FORWARD A HEALTH CARE PLAN ON HIS OWN. WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO TURN THIS AROUND BY VOTING. IF SINCE , WE HAVE SIX MORE DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE IT IN THEIR HANDS TO PUT THIS COUNTRY IN A VASTLY DIFFERENT PATH. THIS IS MY COMMITMENT TO YOU , I WILL PROTECT AND BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE OR CHOOSE A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION. YOU CAN MAKE IT STRONGER, I WILL MAKE IT STRONGER WITH YOUR HELP TO LOWER PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES. WE WILL BRING DOWN DRUG PRICES TO ALMOST 2\/3 OF WHAT THEY ARE BY ALLOWING MEDICARE THAN TO NEGOTIATE THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WERE MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, MAKING THE PRICE LOWER WHEN THEY NEGOTIATE, MEDICARE SAYS WE WILL ONLY PAY YOU X AMOUNT FOR THE FOLLOWING MEDICINES. THAT WILL LOWER PRICES DRASTICALLY, MAKING THEM AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE.WE WILL MAKE SURE EVERY AMERICAN HAS ACCESS TO FREE COVID-19 VACCINES. THIS IS NOT BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. IF WE COME TOGETHER, WE CAN STAND TOGETHER. IF WE STAND TOGETHER AS A UNITED STATES, THE UNITED STATES, DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS, WE CAN TRANSCEND OLD DIVISIONS AND SHOW WHAT'S POSSIBLE. THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO AMERICA'S FUTURE. IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, AS I SAID YESTERDAY IN WARM SPRINGS, GEORGIA, I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO IS NOT IN IT FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR OTHERS A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T DIVIDE US BUT UNITES US, A PRESIDENT WHO APPEALS NOT TO THE WORST IN US BUT THE BEST IN US. A PRESIDENT WHO LOOKS NOT TO SETTLE SCORES BUT TO FIND SOLUTIONS. A PRESIDENT GUIDED NOT BY WISHFUL THINKING BUT BY SCIENCE, REASON AND FACTS. EVEN IF I WIN, IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF HARD WORK TO END THIS PANDEMIC. I'M NOT RUNNING ON THE FALSE PROMISE OF BEING ABLE TO END THE PANDEMIC BY SWITCHING , A BEING ABLE TO END THE PANDEMIC BY FLIPPING A SWITCH BUT WHAT I CAN PROMISE YOU IS WE WILL START ON DAY ONE DOING THE RIGHT THINGS. WE WILL LET SCIENCE DRIVE OUR DECISIONS. WE WILL DEAL HONESTLY WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE WILL NEVER, EVER, EVER QUIT. THAT'S HOW WE WILL SHUT DOWN IS VIRUS SO WE CAN GET BACK TO OUR LIVES A LOT MORE QUICKLY THAN THE PACE WE ARE GOING AT NOW. I'M GOING TO FIGHT TO PROTECT YOUR HEALTH CARE, I PROMISE YOU, JUST LIKE I FIGHT FOR MY OWN FAMILY. WE CAN DO THIS, I PROMISE YOU. I'M GOING TO GO DO WHAT I HOPE ALL OF YOU DO, I'M GOING TO WALK OUT OF THIS TILTING AND I'M GOING TO GO VOTE. I'M GOING TO GO VOTE. THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE BALLOT, NOT JUST ME BUT THE DOWN BALLOT AS WELL. THEY WILL CHANGE THINGS FOR US AND MAKE IT BETTER. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU.

AFTER THE ELECTION, IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE ANY LONGER. JOE BIDEN HAS THE PLAN TO BEAT CORONAVIRUS. AND BUILD OUR ECONOMY BACK BETTER. LIFTING UP ALL COMMUNITIES. JOE IS THE GUY. ARE YOU WITH ME? JOE IS THE GUY THAT GOT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PASSED. I REMEMBERED BEFORE THE ACA, THERE WERE CONSTITUENTS THAT COULD NOT GET INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY HAD PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. JOE CHANGED THAT. HE DELIVERED. IF HE GETS TO THE WHITE HOUSE, HE WILL STRENGTHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO LOWER COST AND EXPAND COVERAGE. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED? EVERYBODY AGREE WITH ME? THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.

TURNING ABANDONED BUILDINGS AND DANGEROUS LOTS AND REPLACING THEM WITH LIFE AND HOPE. MAKING SURE TO BRING THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER TO BUILD HOMES FOR LOCAL FAMILIES, HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE AROUND TAMPA. INSTILL PRIDE, PURPOSE, AND NEIGHBORHOODS. IN LAYING THE GROUNDWORK, THAT IS THE WORK THAT CHANGES THE WORLD. AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE OTHER SPEAKERS HERE TONIGHT INCLUDING A REMARKABLE MAYOR. THANKS FOR THE PASSPORT INTO TOWN. I APPRECIATE IT. AND MY FRIENDS, CONGRESSMAN CHARLIE CRIST. THANK YOU, PAL. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. AND KATHY CASTOR. HER DISTRICT. I SOUGHT PERMISSION TO COME AND SHE SAID OK. AND NOW COHEN WHO WE HAVE TO SEND TO CONGRESS. I JUST SPENT TIME WITH ONE OF MY BEST BUDDIES, A GUY I SERVED WITH FOR A LONG TIME IN THE U.S. SENATE, BILL NELSON. I HAVEN'T SERVED WITH ANYONE WITH MORE CHARACTER,. , AND DECENCY THAN BILL , CHARACTER, COURAGE, AND DECENCY THAN BILL. HIS WIFE IS SOMETHING ELSE, ISN'T SHE? FIVE DAYS LEFT. FIVE DAYS. BUT WHO'S COUNTING, RIGHT? WHO'S COUNTING? SCRANTON? I HAVE A SCRANTON SIGN HERE. I'M GETTING CONFUSED HERE. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE VOTED. 75 MILLION. AND MILLIONS MORE WILL VOTE WHEN THIS IS OVER. I BELIEVE WHEN YOU USE YOUR POWER, THE POWER OF THE VOTE, WE LITERALLY ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF THIS COUNTRY FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. AND FOR FOLKS AT HOME AND ABROAD. HERE IN FLORIDA, YOU ARE THE ONES THAT BUILT THIS COUNTRY. CEO'S AND WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY. YOU DID. I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS, MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HARD-WORKING FOLKS. , MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE DID, HARD WORKING FOLKS. AND YOU ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO SAVE THIS COUNTRY. I SET I GOT INTO THE RACE FOR THREE REASONS A YEAR AGO. LITTLE OVER A YEAR. I MEANT IT. THE FIRST WAS TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. WE ARE MORE DECENT, HONORABLE, MORE RESPECTFUL. WE ARE BETTER PEOPLE. THE SECOND REASON WAS TO RESTORE THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. THE MIDDLE CLASS. TO BRING EVERYBODY ALONG THIS TIME. AND THIRDLY, TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO UNITE US. THESE FINAL DAYS. KEEP THAT SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT WITH YOU AND THAT SENSE OF OPTIMISM. WHAT WE CAN DO AND WHAT WE CAN OVERCOME. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES THAT I AM TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE WILL NEVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN, GIVEN THE CHANCE. ON NOVEMBER 3, WE WILL UNITE THE COUNTRY AND SHOW THE WORLD WHO AMERICA REALLY IS. I MEAN IT. I KNOW IT'S HARD. OVER THESE PAST FEW MONTHS, THERE HAVE BEEN SO MUCH PAIN AND SUFFERING. SO MUCH LOSS IN AMERICA. THE 225,000 PEOPLE DEAD. 225,000. ESTIMATES ARE IF WE HAD REACTED RESPONSIBLY, THERE WOULD BE 160,000 FEWER DEAD. BECAUSE OF COVID-19, WE ARE PAST THE 9 MILLION MARK OF PEOPLE INFECTED. MORE THAN 16,000 PEOPLE IN FLORIDA HAVE BEEN LOST. AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK AND ON THE EDGE. IT'S A FREIGHT TRAIN. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IF HE STAYS IN OFFICE. DONALD TRUMP WAS GIVING UP OVER THE WEEKEND. I'M QUOTING. WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. IT IS OBVIOUS HE'S NOT. AT THE DEBATE LAST WEEK, TRUMP SAID THAT WE ARE ROUNDING THE CORNER. IT IS GOING AWAY. WE ARE GOING TO LIVE WITH IT. REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD HIM. HE'S ASKING US TO DIE WITH IT. THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING. DONALD TRUMP HAS WAIVED THE WHITE FLAG, ABANDONED FAMILIES, AND SURRENDERED TO THE VIRUS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEVER GIVE UP, NEVER GIVE IN, AND WE DON'T COWER. DONALD TRUMP JUST HAD A SUPER SPREADER EVENT AGAIN. HE'S SPREADING MORE THAN JUST CORONAVIRUS. HE IS SPREADING DIVISION AND DISCORD. WE NEED A PRESIDENT THAT WILL BRING US TOGETHER, NOT PULL US APART. I WILL PUT A PLAN IN PLACE TO DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC RESPONSIBLY, BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER TESTING, TRACING, MASKING. DOCTORS IN AMERICA, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT'S OWN CDC DIRECTOR AND DR. FAUCI WHO SAID THAT IF WE JUST WORE A MASK BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR, WE WOULD SAVE 100,000 LIVES. FOLKS, THAT IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT. IT IS A PATRIOTIC DUTY, FOR GOD 'S SAKE. BUT STILL, DONALD TRUMP REFUSES TO LISTEN TO SCIENCE. AND WE SHOULDN'T BE POLITICIZING THE RACE FOR A VACCINE. WE SHOULD BE PLANNING FOR ITS SAFE USE AND FREE AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION, PROVIDING PPE FOR NATIONAL STANDARDS AND BUSINESSES UP AND SAFETY , OPEN SAFELY. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN PASSED BY THE DEMOCRATIC COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVES. I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE. I'M NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE ECONOMY. I'M NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE COUNTRY. I'M GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE VIRUS. DONALD TRUMP INHERITED A STRONG ECONOMY FROM BARACK AND ME. JUST LIKE HE INHERITED EVERYTHING IN HIS LIFE. IT'S A FACT. HE SQUANDERED THAT A QUANT TO ME , HE SQUANDERED THAT ECONOMY LIKE HE SQUANDERED EVERYTHING ELSE. FOLKS, I PROMISE YOU. I GUARANTEE YOU. WE CAN BUILD BACK. AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT WEALTH. AND WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT RAISING TAXES A SINGLE SOLITARY PENNY FOR WORKING-CLASS AND MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES. I GUARANTEE YOU THAT NO ONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 WILL PAY A SINGLE PENNY MORE IN TAXES. NOT ONE PENNY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I MAKE NO APOLOGIES FOR IT. I WILL ASK THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS, THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT DID NOT PAY A SINGLE PENNY AND FEDERAL TAXES. I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. WHY SHOULD A FIREFIGHTER, AND EDUCATOR, A NURSE PAY A HIGHER RATE THAN THE SUPER WEALTHY CORPORATE AMERICA? BECAUSE YOU DO. YOU DO. WHY SHOULD YOU PAY MORE TAXES THAN DONALD TRUMP PAYS? YOU KNOW, IF WE MADE THIS AS A MOVIE 10 YEARS AGO, PEOPLE WOULD THINK WE ARE MAKING IT UP. BUT IT'S TRUE. WE WILL BOOK , DELIVER TO ACTUALLY FOR THE WORKING CLASS. HELP YOU PAY HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS. FOR CHILD CARE. FOR ELIMINATING COLLEGE DEBT. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS. AND WE CAN AFFORD IT. TRUMP GOT HIS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. AND HE DID IT FOR ONE OVERWHELMING REASON. SOMETHING HE'S BEEN TRYING TO DISTANCE THE DAY HE GOT ELECTED. TO DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. HE'S GOING AT IT AGAIN. IF THEY GET THEIR WAY, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. CANCER, ALL DISEASES THAT ARE OUT THERE. FOLKS, LOOK. 8.4 MILLION FLORIDIANS HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. OBLIGATIONS OF COVID-19 WILL BECOME THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. ALLOWING INSURERS TO JACK UP YOUR PREMIUMS. A LOT OF YOU YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T EVEN REALIZE IT BUT BEFORE WE PASSED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, INSURANCE CHARGED WOMEN MORE FOR THE SAME HEALTH CARE AS MEN JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN. A FACT. DONALD TRUMP THINKS HEALTH CARE IS A PRIVILEGE. I THINK IT IS YOUR RIGHT. WE WILL NOT ONLY RESTORE OBAMA CARE, WE WILL STRENGTHEN AND BUILD ON IT. YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE IF YOU LIKE IT. AND YOU CAN CHOOSE A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION IF YOU DON'T. DEDUCTIBLES, PREMIUMS, OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING, REDUCING UNKNOWN BILLING. REDUCING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BY UP TO 60% BY ALLOWING , NOT MAKING THIS STUFF UP , ALLOWING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES. WE WILL KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. MEANWHILE, THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACTUARY, THE GUY WHO RUNS IT, THEY SAY DONALD TRUMP WILL BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BY 2023. AS MY WIFE WOULD SAY, GOOGLE IT. YOU WILL SEE WHAT I'M TELLING YOU. YOU GOT THAT RIGHT, PAL. HE SAID TRUMP IS BANKRUPT. HE PROBABLY IS, HE OWES $400 BILLION TO SOMEBODY. , $400 MILLION TO SOMEBODY. WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR MILITARY FAMILIES. OF ALL THE THINGS DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID IT, NOTHING HAS , SAID, NOTHING HAS BOTHERED ME WORSE THAN THE WAY HE HAS SPOKEN TO THOSE THAT SERVED IN UNIFORM. HE CALLED THEM LOSERS AND SUCKERS. MY DECEASED SON, BEAU BIDEN WON THE BRONZE STAR, THE SERVICE MEDAL AND OTHER AWARDS, VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. GAVE UP HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL JOB TO GO. HE WASN'T A SUCKER OR LOSER. HE WAS A PATRIOT LIKE ALL OF YOU WHO SERVE. LIKE YOUR SONS, YOUR DAUGHTERS. YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR GRANDPARENTS. WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR THEIR DIGNITY. THE RESPECT THEY ARE DUE. WHILE DONALD TRUMP FAILS TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACY, WE CAN DELIVER RACIAL JUSTICE WHILE HE IS TRYING TO MAKE IT WORSE. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T BELIEVE SYSTEMIC RACISM IS A PROBLEM. HE WON'T SAY BLACK LIVES MATTER. WE KNOW THEY MATTER. THAT'S WHY PROTEST HAS BROKEN OUT ACROSS THE NATION. BY THE WAY, PROTESTING IS NOT BURNING AND LOOTING. VIOLENCE MUST NEVER BE A TACTIC TOLERATED. AND IT WON'T. BUT THESE PROTESTERS HAVE A CRY FOR JUSTICE. THE NAMES OF GEORGE FLOYD, BREONNA TAYLOR AND JACOB BLAKE WILL NOT SOON BE FORGOTTEN. NOT BY ME, NOT BY US, NOT BY THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] WHEN I MET WITH A FAMILY, THE LITTLE DAUGHTER LOOKED AT ME. SHE IS ONLY SEVEN YEARS OLD. I KNELT DOWN TO TALK TO HER IN 00, AND THE FAMILY. SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, MY DADDY IS CHANGING THE WORLD. GUESS WHAT? INSPIRATION COMING FROM HER DADDY WOULD HAPPEN. THERE'S A NEW WAVE OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA. TRUE JUSTICE IS MORE THAN JUST DEALING WITH ABUSE. IT'S ABOUT ECONOMIC JUSTICE. IT'S ABOUT SCHOOLS, HOUSING, ACCESS TO CAPITAL. GOOD PAYING JOBS. A MINIMUM WAGE OF $15 AN HOUR. FINANCIAL STABILITY, GIVING FAMILIES OF COLOR A REAL SHOT. THE OWNER WHO WILL START A SMALL BUSINESS AND SEND A CHILD TO COLLEGE DEBT FREE SO THAT THEY CAN PASS ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR GENERATIONS LIKE WE DID. LIKE SO MANY MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES HAVE IN THE PAST. BUT WE HAVE TO VOTE TO ENSURE THE FULL PROMISE OF THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO VOTE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF CLIMATE CRISIS. BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN FLORIDA, IT IS A CRISIS. WE ARE SEEING THE IMPACT MORE THAN MOST. DEVASTATING HURRICANES THAT LAY WASTE TO ALL COMMUNITIES. THE ECONOMIC TOLL IS ASTOUNDING AND IT GROWS EVERY YEAR. BUT THE HUMANS WHOLE IS WORSE. LOST LIVES, LOST HOMES, SMALL BUSINESS IS SHATTERED, FIRST RESPONDERS PUT AT RISK. THE WEST COAST BURNING. THE MIDDLE PART OF THE COUNTRY FLOODING. DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE THINKS CLIMATE CHANGE, HE SAYS HOAX. SPEAKING OF HOAXES, REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE INCREASING VIOLENT HURRICANES AND THE FREQUENCY? HE SAID, MAYBE WE SHOULD DETONATE A NUCLEAR BOMB OVER THE ATLANTIC. BY THE WAY, THE SAME STABLE GENIUS THAT SAID THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAD IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR IS WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH AIRPORTS. WHOA. YO, MAN. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. HIS ANSWERS TO FAMILIES IN PUERTO RICO STRUGGLING THROUGH HURRICANE MARIA, WHAT DID HE DO? TOSS ROLLS OF PAPER TOWELS AT THEM. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL ANSWERS. WE KNOW WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS JOBS. WE CAN BUILD A STRONGER AND MORE CLIMATE RESISTANT NATION, CREATING MILLIONS OF HIGH-PAYING JOBS. WE CAN CHANGE THE PATH WE ARE ON. WE HAVE TO ACT NOW. TIME IS RUNNING OUT IN THIS COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD FORMER YEARS OF TRUMP WHO THINKS HE IS ONLY RESPONSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR HIM. I DON'T SEE THE PRESIDENCY THAT WAY. I RUN AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT. IT IS STARTING TO RAIN SO I WILL SHORTEN THIS FOR YOU. I DON'T SEE AMERICA THAT WAY. YOU PLACED YOUR TRUST IN BARACK AND ME IN 2012 AND 2008. EACH DAY WE WERE IN OFFICE, WE WORKED FOR YOU AND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. IT WAS NEVER ABOUT RED STATES OR BLUE STATES, ONLY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I WAS REMINDED THAT LAST MONTH WHEN I VISITED GETTYSBURG. WHEN I WENT TO GETTYSBURG TO MAKE THAT SPEECH, ABRAHAM LEE , LINCOLN SAID A HOUSE DIVIDED CANNOT STAND. A NATION DIVIDED CANNOT STAND. I WAS REMINDED OF THAT EARLIER THIS WEEK. RETURN YOUR BALLOT TODAY. PRESIDENT KENNY SAID WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE. LET'S NOT POSTPONE AND GET OUT OF THE RAIN. GOD BLESS YOU ALL, THANK YOU. (music) GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND. GOT TO MAKE THE ROAD GO ROUND. GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD NOW.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?477499-1\/joe-biden-drive-campaign-rally-tampa","Summary":"2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered remarks at a &ldquo;drive-in&rdquo; campaign rally in Tampa.

[HONKING] THIS IS OUR MOMENT. OUR COUNTRY CANNOT TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. THE RULE OF LAW CAN'T TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO THINKS HE IS ABOVE IT. DECENCY CANNOT TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT IT. OUR DEMOCRACY CANNOT TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO THINKS HE CAN BULLDOZE THROUGH IT AND THE AMERICAN DREAM CANNOT TAKE FOUR MORE YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO THINKS HE CAN CHOOSE WHO LIVES IT. [HONKING] FOR ME, LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE, THE REASON PEOPLE ARE VOTING IN DROVES, THE REASON OVER 85 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE VOTED IS THAT FOR SO MONEY PEOPLE, THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT TV COMMERCIALS AND NUMBERS AND RHETORIC, THIS IS PERSONAL. IT IS PERSONAL FOR ME. MY HUSBAND GOT REALLY SICK WITH THIS VIRUS EARLY ON IN MARCH AND HE ENDED UP IN THE HOSPITAL FOR NEARLY A WEEK WITH PNEUMONIA, ON OXYGEN. HE MADE IT THROUGH. HE IS HERE. JOHN IS RIGHT HERE. [HONKING] AND WHEN I FOUND OUT A FEW MONTHS AGO THAT THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY KNEW WAY BACK THEN BECAUSE HE TOLD BOB WOODWARD HE KNEW IT WAS AIRBORNE AND AT THE TIME, WE WERE CLEANING UP EVERY SURFACE, WHICH WE SHOULD DO, BUT WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH IT WAS AIRBORNE BACK THEN. HE MIGHT NOT HAVE GOTTEN SICK, BUT THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T TELL US. THEN MY DAD GOT IT IN HIS ASSISTED LIVING AT AGE 92 AND I WILL NEVER FORGET STANDING OUTSIDE THE GLASS, LOOKING IN, THREE OF THE 16 PEOPLE WHERE HE LIVED DIED AND I LOOKED AT HIM AND HE LOOKED SO SMALL AND SO SAD AND CONFUSED. AND I THOUGHT THIS IS GOING TO BE THE LAST TIME I EVER SEE HIM, LIKE THAT. HE MADE IT THROUGH. BUT SO MANY AMERICANS HAVE NOT MADE IT THROUGH. SO MANY AMERICANS, OVER 225,000 AMERICANS ARE GOING TO BE AT THEIR THANKSGIVING TABLE AND THERE IS GOING TO BE AN EMPTY CHAIR. 24 MINNESOTANS HAVE NOT BEEN SO LUCKY. BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY. AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY. WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO CLAIMS EVERYONE FOR EVERYTHING. HE BLAMES DR. FAUCI, HE BLAMES HIS OWN PEOPLE, HE LITERALLY SHOULD HAVE A SIGN ON HIS DESK THAT SAYS THE BUCK STOPS ANYWHERE BUT HERE. [HONKING] JOE BIDEN, HE WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY , SEE HOW PERFECT THAT WAS? HE WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. HE WILL BE A PRESIDENT FOR ALL OF AMERICA BECAUSE, AS HE HAS SAID, THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT. THIS IS AN AMERICAN MOMENT. IN THIS MOMENT, MINNESOTA, WE DESERVE LEADERS WHO ARE AS RESILIENT AS OUR PEOPLE. WE DESERVE LEADERS WHO WILL BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, WHO DON'T WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND SAY WHAT MEAN TWEET CAN I WRITE? HOW CAN I DIVIDE PEOPLE? JOE BIDEN WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO HAS BUILT THE SUPPORT OF YES, OUR FIRED UP DEMOCRATIC FAITH BUT INDEPENDENCE AND REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF JOHN KASICH, FORMER REPUBLICAN EVAN OF OHIO. HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF COLIN POWELL. HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF MY FRIEND, CINDY MCCAIN. HE HAS BUILT A COALITION THAT WILL HELP US WIN, BUT IT WILL ALSO HELP US GOVERN SO THAT WE CAN TAKE ON THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIMES. YES, THIS PANDEMIC, BUT ALSO OUR ECONOMY, CLIMATE CHANGE, AFFORDABLE EDUCATION, AND YES, UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. AMERICA DESERVES PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. [HONKING] SO, JOE BIDEN IS A MAN OF SCRAPPY WORKING CLASS ROOTS. A MAN WHOSE OWN HARDSHIPS HAVE ONLY MADE HIM MORE DETERMINED TO LIFT UP THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT. HE HAS A PLAN TO BUILD BACK BETTER AND YOU CAN COUNT ON HIM TO HELP THIS COUNTRY NOT JUST RECOVER BUT RENEW ITS SPIRIT TO TAKE ON THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME. YES, HE WILL BE COMPETENT, BUT HE WILL ALSO GOVERN FROM HIS HEART. HE WILL BE THE PRESIDENT FOR ALL OF AMERICA. SO RECENTLY, HE GAVE HIS LAST CLOSING ARGUMENT IN GEORGIA. THAT WARMED MY HEART BECAUSE AS SOME OF YOU KNOW, I RAN FOR PRESIDENT. AND AS I WENT AROUND THE COUNTRY, I TOLD THE STORY HE TOLD AT WARM SPRINGS AND HE WENT THAT WAY BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT WENT TO RECOVER FROM THE POLIOVIRUS AND HE WAS A BELOVED PRESIDENT AND CAME IN AT A VERY, VERY HARD TIME FOR OUR COUNTRY AND IN LITERALLY 100 DAYS CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY. THAT IS THE BURDEN THAT WILL BE ON JOE BIDEN'S SHOULDERS. AND WHEN FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT COMPLETED HIS WORK, AFTER MANY, MANY YEARS, WHEN HE DIED, HE WAS SO BELOVED THAT THE COUNTRY STOOD UP, SPONTANEOUSLY AT THE TRAIN TRACKS WHERE HIS BODY WAS TAKEN THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THERE'S A STORY OF A GUY, A REGULAR GUY STANDING BY THOSE TRACKS WITH HIS HAT IN HIS HAND AND THE REPORTER LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID SIR, THE GUY IS SOBBING , DID YOU KNOW PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT? AND THE GUY SAID NO. I DIDN'T KNOW THE PRESIDENT, BUT HE KNEW ME. HE KNEW ME. [HONKING] THAT IS JOE BIDEN. SO IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BALANCE YOUR TODDLER ON YOUR KNEE AND TRIED TO ALLEN'S YOUR LAP TOP ON YOUR DESK, JOE BIDEN KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. IF YOU ARE A DAD THAT HAS TO TEACH A FIRST GRADER TO USE THE MUTE BUTTON JUST SO SHE CAN LEARN TO READ, JOE BIDEN KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. IF YOU'VE GOT A PARENT IN A NURSING HOME, ASSISTED LIVING OR EVEN IN THEIR OWN HOUSE AND YOU CAN'T EVEN GO AND GIVE THEM A HUG, JOE BIDEN KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. IF YOU CAN'T DECIDE IF YOU ARE GOING TO FILL YOUR REFRIGERATOR OR FILL YOUR PRESCRIPTION, JOE BIDEN KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. THIS IS IT, MINNESOTA. AND I WANT TO SAY ONE LAST THING TO EVERYONE AT HOME WATCHING. IF YOU ARE CAUGHT IN THE EXTREME OF OUR POLITICS AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO STAND UP FOR YOU AND YOU ARE TIRED OF THE NOISE AND THE NONSENSE, JOE KNOWS YOU AND HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. SO LET US GET OUT THE VOTE. LET US NOT LET ONE POLITICAL PARTY STOP THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE, DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENCE COMING TOGETHER ELECTING A MAN OF TRUE GRIT, A MAN WHO LOVES THIS NATION, A MAN WHO WILL GET UP EVERY MORNING AND THINK OF YOU INSTEAD OF HIM AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN. THANK YOU, MINNESOTA. LET'S GO AND WIN. [APPLAUSE] [HONKING] (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AIN'T NOTHING WRONG AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT, MAMA AIN'T NOTHING WRONG AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT, NOW AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AIN'T NOTHING WRONG (music) HELLO, MINNESOTA. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH OF AN HONOR IT IS TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY. I'M A MINNESOTAN WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. WE HAVE ALL HEARD ALL YEAR HOW THIS IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME AND MAYBE IN HISTORY. IT IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. THE VERY FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF OUR COMMUNITY IS ON THE BALLOT. AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I LIVE THAT. IN 2012, WHEN I WAS SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IS A VICIOUS DISEASE, WHERE A BODY ATTACKS ITSELF THROUGH ITS OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM. SO MY BODY STARTED ATTACKING MY JOINTS AND EATING HOLES INTO MY BONES. IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY PAINFUL. SOMETIMES JUST TURNING A KEY IN A LOCK CAN FEEL LIKE MY KNUCKLES WILL JUST FIRST OPEN. BUT THERE IS NO CURE. BUT I DID FIND A MEDICATION. THE PROBLEM IS THAT MEDICATION COSTS $54,000 PER YEAR, EVERY YEAR FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW, MY MEDICATION WOULD HAVE BANKRUPTED ME. MY PREGNANCY ITSELF COULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. BUT THE ACA KEPT ME AND MY FAMILY AFLOAT FOR EIGHT YEARS. JOE BIDEN HELPED PASS THE ACA. [HONKING] NOW, 20 MILLION MORE AMERICANS HAVE INSURANCE NOW THAN 10 YEARS AGO. JOE BIDEN FOUGHT FOR MILLIONS LIKE ME WHO HAVE THE EXISTING CONDITIONS. WHEN I TELL YOU THE STAKES OF THIS ELECTION ARE LIFE AND DEATH, I AM SPEAKING FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. AND YES, SENATOR KLOBUCHAR, I DO TAKE THIS PERSONALLY. [HONKING] BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO REPEAL THE. HE SAID THAT. HE IS AT THE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW ASKING THEM TO STRIKE DOWN THAT LAW. IF THAT HAPPENS, IF I LOSE MY INSURANCE, I WILL GET THAT $54,000 WILL. I CAN'T AFFORD THAT. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU IF WE ELECT JOE BIDEN, WE WILL HAVE AN ALLY IN THE WHITE HOUSE INSTEAD OF AN ADVERSARY. [HONKING] HE WILL MAKE HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE TO MORE AMERICANS THAN EVER BEFORE. INSTEAD OF REPEALING THE, HE WILL BUILD ON IT. HE WILL ADD A PUBLIC OPTION TO EXPAND COVERAGE AND HE WILL LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND OTHER HEALTH COSTS. MINNESOTANS ARE ALREADY VOTING IN RECORD NUMBERS. BUT THE JOB IS NOT DONE YET. WITH SO MUCH AT STAKE, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT. I CANNOT RELAX. UNTIL WE ARE CERTAIN EVERY MINNESOTAN HAS DONE THEIR JOB AND CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR JOE BIDEN AND, HARRIS. [HONKING] HERE IS WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO. IF YOU HAVEN'T VOTED YET, GOAD DO IT TODAY. GO TO I WILL VOTE.COM\/MN TO FIGHT AND EARLY VOTING SITE NEAR YOU. AND IF YOU HAVE AN ABSENTEE BALLOT YOU HAVEN'T MAY YIELD , YOU HAVEN'T MAILED IN YET, TAKE IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO A DROP OFF LOCATION. IF WE DO THAT IN THE NEXT FOUR DAYS, WE WILL ELECT JOE BIDEN. [HONKING] WITH THAT, IT IS MY DISTINCT HONOR TO INTRODUCE THE MAN HIMSELF, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, JOE BIDEN. (music) (music) [\"LET'S GO CRAZY\" BY PRINCE PLAYING] HELLO, MINNESOTA. JESSICA, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND SHARING YOUR STORY. UNFORTUNATELY, SOME OF THE OTHER AMERICANS HAVE STORIES LIKE YOU, FACED WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS, FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES AND FORCED THINK NOT ONLY ABOUT FACING THE BATTLE BUT HOW THEY CAN AFFORD THE TREATMENT. WHILE INSURANCE COMPANIES COME IN AT THE MOST VULNERABLE MOMENTS FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS, I REMEMBER WHEN MY SON BEAU WAS LYING IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER HE CAME HOME FROM IRAQ AFTER A YEAR. HE HAD STAGE IV GLIOBLASTOMA. THEY DIDN'T TELL HIM HOW LONG HE WAS GOING TO LIVE. AS HE LAID THERE FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE, FIGHTING TO HANG ON, I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE IF MY INSURANCE COMPANY, HIS INSURANCE COMPANY SAID YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF COVERAGE. TIME'S UP. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. FOLKS, IT'S A QUESTION NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO FACE IN AMERICA. THAT IS WHY I FOUGHT SO HARD AND WHY OBAMACARE WAS SUCH A BIG THING. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE. [HONKING] IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE DONALD TRUMP, FROM THE DAY HE GOT ELECTED TO RIGHT NOW, HE IS FIGHTING IN COURT TO RIP THAT AWAY FROM TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET HIM DO IT. WE ARE NEVER GOING BACK TO THOSE DAYS. [HONKING] WE ARE GOING TO WIN, FOR YOU, JESSICA, AND YOUR FAMILY. I PROMISE YOU I WILL PROTECT YOUR FAMILY AS IF IT WERE MY OWN. [HONKING] I WANT TO THANK ALL THE SPEAKERS YOU HEARD EARLIER. YOUR GOVERNOR, LEADING MINNESOTA WITH DECENCY AND INTEGRITY. ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, LET'S SEND HER BACK TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WE NEED HER BADLY. AND YOUR INCREDIBLE JUNIOR SENATOR, TINA SMITH , SHE HAS GOT TO GO BACK. [HONKING] AND LOOK, LET'S WIN BACK THE MINNESOTA STATE SENATE WHILE WE ARE AT IT. [HONKING] ONE OF THE NATION'S FINEST LEADERS IN A DEAR FRIEND, I'VE BEEN HONORED TO STAND ALONGSIDE AND FIGHT TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME, SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR. AMY, I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. [HONKING] YESTERDAY, AND FLORIDA, HAD A CHANCE TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME WITH ANOTHER IN , ANOTHER MINNESOTA ICON. CARL ANTHONY TOWNS. BOY, HE CAN PLAY, MAN. YOU KNOW HIM AS THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE TIMBERWOLVES, BUT HE'S ALSO A SON, WHO LIKE MANY OTHER AMERICANS LOST HIS MOM TO COVID 19 A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. FOR ALL THOSE SONS AND DAUGHTERS, THOSE PARENTS, SIBLINGS, HUSBANDS, AND WIVES FACING EMPTY CHAIRS AT DINING ROOM TABLES, ALL OF THOSE WHO REACH OVER AT NIGHT TO SAY GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR HUSBAND OR WIFE, THEY DESERVE SO MUCH BETTER. THESE GUYS ARE NOT VERY POLITE, BUT THEY ARE LIKE TRUMP. [HONKING] THEY ARE GOING TO BE OK. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AS WELL. WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND FIGHT FOR ALL THESE FOLKS. WE HAVE FOUR DAYS LEFT TO GET IT DONE. FOUR DAYS. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALREADY VOTING. MILLIONS MORE WILL VOTE BY TUESDAY. AND I BELIEVE WHEN YOU USE YOUR POWER TO VOTE, IT WILL CHANGE THE COURSE OF THIS COUNTRY IN THE COURSE OF HISTORY. RIGHT HERE IN MINNESOTA, WITH ALL OF YOU, IN THE FINAL DAYS, KEEP THAT SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT. KEEP THAT SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT, THAT SENSE OF OPTIMISM SO WE CAN OVERCOME. THERE'S A REASON THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR ME. THEY KNOW THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING, SO THEY ARE NOT USED TO NOT HEARING ANYTHING. I KNOW IT'S HARD, FOLKS. MORE THAN 20028I BELIEVE NOW THOUSAND AMERICANS HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF COVID-19. NEARLY 2500 HERE IN MINNESOTA, GONE. WE HAVE 9 MILLION NEW CASES NATIONWIDE. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE OUT OF WORK. ON THE EDGE, THEY CAN'T SEE ANY LIGHT, THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING, AND DONALD TRUMP HAS SIMPLY GIVEN UP. OVER THE WEEKEND, WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, CHIEF OF STAFF, HE SAID THE FOLLOWING , WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. AT THE DEBATE LAST WEEK, DONALD TRUMP TURNED TO ME AND SAID WE ARE ROUNDING THE CORNER, IT'S GOING AWAY. WE ARE LEARNING TO LIVE WITH THAT. I TOLD HIM, HE'S ASKING US TO LEARN TO DIE WITH IT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO. [HONKING] DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID TODAY? WHAT HE SAID TODAY ON THE TRAIL, HE SAID OUR DOCTORS, OUR DOCTORS, OUR FIRST RESPONDERS, OVER A THOUSAND LOST THEIR LIVES , PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE, BUSTING THEIR NEXT, HE SAID THEY ARE MAKING UP DEATHS FROM COVID BECAUSE THEY GET MORE MONEY. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS ACCUSING THE MEDICAL PROFESSION OF MAKING UP COVID DEATHS SO THEY MAKE MORE MONEY. DOCTORS AND NURSES GO TO WORK EVERY DAY TO SAVE LIVES. THEY DO THEIR JOBS. DONALD TRUMP SHOULD STOP ATTACKING THEM AND DO HIS JOB. [HONKING] FOLKS, THIS IS THE SAME MAN WHO WEEKS AGO, WHEN HE WAS TOLD WE ARE LOSING A THOUSAND LIVES A DAY, RUN NUMBER WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID IT IS WHAT IT IS. THAT'S THOUGHTFUL. IT IS WHAT IT IS BECAUSE HE IS WHO HE IS. DONALD TRUMP HAS WAVED THE WHITE FLAG AND SURRENDERED TO THIS VIRUS. BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T GIVE UP. THEY DON'T COWER. REMEMBER WHEN HE DID THAT INTERVIEW AND TOLD BOB WOODWARD THAT HE KNEW ABOUT THE VIRUS AND HOW DEADLY IT WAS AT THE END OF JANUARY BUT DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. AND WOODWARD ASKED HIM WHY. HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO PANIC THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T PANIC. DONALD TRUMP PANICKED. [HONKING] UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, WE WILL NOT SURRENDER TO THIS VIRUS. LOOK, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SPREADING DIVISION AND DISCORD. HE THINKS HE CAN DIVIDE US. WE WON'T NOTICE HIS FAILURES. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. THAT'S WHY HE SHAMELESSLY EQUATES SOMALI REFUGEES, FOLKS SEEKING A BETTER LIFE IN AMERICA WITH TERRORISTS AS HE DID LAST NIGHT. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL BRING US TOGETHER, NOT PULL US APART. I WILL DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC RESPONSIBLY, BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AROUND TESTING, TRACING. IT'S ESTIMATED BY THE LEADING DOCTORS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IF WE JUST WORE A MASK FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, WE WOULD SAVE OVER 100,000 LIVES OF THE 200,000 LIVES WE EXPECT TO LOSE. DR. FAUCI CALLED FOR A MASK MANDATE LAST WEEK. THIS IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT LIKE THOSE UGLY THINGS OVER THERE BEEPING THE HORNS. THIS IS A PATRIOTIC DUTY, FOR GOD SAKE. [HONKING] LOOK, IN HIS OWN WORDS, AS I SAID, THE PRESIDENT KNEW BACK IN JANUARY HOW EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND COMMUNICABLE THIS DISEASE WAS. HE WENT ON AND MADE THAT TAPE, HE SAID THE DISEASE WAS EASILY ABLE TO SPREAD, BUT HE DID NOTHING. HE DID NOTHING AT ALL. LOOK, FOLKS, AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TOUGH. INSTEAD OF TALKING AND POLITICIZING THE VACCINE, HE SHOULD BE PLANNING FOR A SAFE, EQUITABLE AND FREE DISTRIBUTION OF A VACCINE WHEN IT COMES NEXT YEAR. [HONKING] THIS GUY REFUSES TO PROVIDE SCHOOLS AND SMALL BUSINESSES THE RESOURCES AND THE NATIONAL STANDARD TO OPEN SAFELY. THE HOUSE OF PAST THE MONEY TO ALLOW SCHOOLS TO OPEN SAFELY, BUSINESSES TO OPEN SAFELY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE PAID. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE WILL BRING REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TOGETHER TO BRING RELIEF FOR WORKING FAMILIES, SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES. I'M NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE ECONOMY. I'M GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE VIRUS. [HONKING] DONALD TRUMP INHERITED A STRONG ECONOMY THAT BARACK AND I GAVE HIM. BUT GUESS WHAT? LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HE INHERITED, HE SQUANDERED IT. LIKE EVERYTHING HE HAS INHERITED. BUT WE CAN BUILD BACK AND WE CAN BUILD BACK BETTER WITH AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK, NOT WEALTH. WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES. I PROMISE YOU, YOU HAVE MY WORD, IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR, YOU WON'T PAY A PENNY MORE IN TAXES. [HONKING] BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME, THE WEALTHIEST AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS ARE GOING TO START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. 91 OUT OF THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES PAID ZERO IN TAXES LAST YEAR. WHY? HEARING THAT GUY BLOWING HIS HORN, WHY SHOULD HE PAY, WHY SHOULD A NURSE PAY HIGHER TAX RATES THAN THE SUPER WEALTHY? WHY SHOULD YOU PAY MORE TAXES THEN DONALD TRUMP PAYS? [HONKING] HE HAS EXPLOITED EVERY LOOPHOLE AND TAX CODE, HE HAS RUN A SHELL GAME TO AVOID PAYING TAXES. IF YOU NOTICE, I RELEASED 22 YEARS OF MY TAX RETURNS. HE'S NOT RELEASED ONE SINGLE YEAR. WHAT IS HE HIDING? WHERE'S THE CORRUPTION? ACCORDING TO TRUMP, THE REASON AIOLI PAY $750 IS BECAUSE HE SMART. WHAT DOES THAT MAKE THE REST OF US TO PAY OUR FAIR SHARE, MR. PRESIDENT? WE ARE GOING TO DELIVER TAX RELIEF FOR WORKING FAMILIES, HELP YOU PAY FOR HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS OR CHILDCARE OR CARE FOR YOUR AGING PARENTS OR BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR SCHOOL. TRUMP GOT A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE , FIRST TIME IT HAS EVER HAPPENED WHILE AN ELECTION HAS ALREADY STARTED , FOR ONE REASON. HE'S DETERMINED TO DO WHAT HE COULDN'T DO FOR FOUR YEARS, DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IF THEY GET THEIR WAY, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE THEIR PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. COMPLICATIONS FOR COVID-19 WILL BE THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, ALLOWING INSURERS TO JACK UP YOUR PREMIUMS OR DENY YOU COVERAGE. AND WE WILL AGAIN BE ABLE TO BE CHARGED MORE FOR THE SAME HEALTH CARE JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE A WOMAN. DONALD TRUMP THINKS HEALTH CARE IS A PRIVILEGE. I THINK IT IS YOUR RIGHT. [HONKING] AND IF YOU ALL GET OUT AND VOTE, WE WILL NOT ONLY RESTORE OBAMACARE, WE WILL EXPAND IT AND BUILD ON IT. YOU CAN KEEP YOUR INSURANCE IF YOU LIKE OR CHOOSE A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION, A PUBLIC OPTION. WE WILL INCREASE SUBSIDIES, LOWER YOUR PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES, OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING, REDUCED COSTS BY 60% BY ALLOWING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE WITH DRUG PRICES. WE WILL KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. I WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. MEANWHILE, THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACTUARY SAID IF DONALD TRUMP SAYS ELECT ME AGAIN AND I'M GOING TO CHANGE SOCIAL SECURITY. THE ACTUARY SAID THE CHANGES HE PUTS IN PLACE, SOCIAL SECURITY WOULD BE BANKRUPT IN 2023. SO GO HOME AND TELL YOUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WHAT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO DO. I WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. [HONKING] FOLKS, NOTHING IS WORSE THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT THOSE WHO SERVE IN UNIFORM. HE CALLED THEM LOSERS AND SUCKERS. MY SON BEAU GAVE UP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S SEAT IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE TO VOLUNTEER TO GO TO A RACK FOR A YEAR. HE WON THE BRONZE STAR, THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MEDAL. HE WASN'T A LOSER OR SUCKER. HE WAS A PATRIOT. [HONKING] SO MANY OF YOU AS WELL. NO WONDER THE SIX GENERALS WHO WORKED DIRECTLY FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAVE LEFT AND SAYS HE DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ANY PRESIDENT BEFORE. [HONKING] THAT'S WHY SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMANDER STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, NAVY SEAL COMMANDER ADMIRAL CREMA AND, OH , OVER 24 STARS , OVER 20 FOUR STARS ENDORSED ME BECAUSE THEY TRUST ME. [HONKING] THAT'S WHY THE MILITARY TIMES REPORTED MORE TROOPS VOTE FOR BIDEN THEN TRUMP. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THE MILITARY. THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY. LET THEM VOTE AND VOTE FOR THEM. WHEN DONALD TRUMP FAILED TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACY, WE CAN DELIVER ON RACIAL JUSTICE. SEEING PROTESTERS ACROSS THE NATION, THE LIFE AND DIGNITY AND GEORGE FLOYD KILLED SEVEN MILES FROM HERE AND SO MANY OTHERS , PROTESTING, BURNING AND LOOTING IS NOT PROTESTING , IT VIOLENCE, CLEAR AND SIMPLE AND WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. BUT THESE PROTESTS ARE A CRY FOR JUSTICE. THE NAMES GEORGE FLOYD, BREONNA TAYLOR COME IN JACOB BLAKE WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN, NOT BY ME, NOT BY US, NOT BY THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE TRUE JUSTICE IS ALSO ECONOMIC JUSTICE. ACCESS TO SCHOOLING, HOUSING, ACCESS TO CAPITAL, GOOD PAYING JOBS WITH FINANCIAL STABILITY, GIVING FAMILIES OF COLOR A REAL SHOT TO OWN A HOME, START A SMALL BUSINESS, SEND A CHILD TO COLLEGE THEY CAN BUILD WEALTH AND PASS ON OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THE GENERATIONS LIKE THE REST OF US HAVE. WE HAVE TO VOTE TO ENSURE THE FULL PROMISE OF THIS COUNTRY FOR EVERYONE. FINALLY, WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR THE CHALLENGES OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THE WEST IS ON FIRE, LOSING MORE FORESTS THAN THE TOTAL LAND OF CONNECTICUT AND RHODE ISLAND COMBINED. THE MIDWEST IS FLOODING. HERE IN MINNESOTA, IT INCURS BIG COSTS, INCREASE FLOODING IN MISSISSIPPI. IN SAINT PAUL, , DONALD TRUMP THINKS IT'S ALL A HOAX. HE SURE IS A STABLE GENIUS. HE SAID WIND POWER CAUSES CANCER. I SAY IT CREATES JOBS, MINNESOTA JOBS. [HONKING] WE CAN COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE, BUILDING A MORE RESILIENT NATION AND CREATING MILLIONS OF NEW HIGH-PAYING JOBS. WE CAN CHANGE THE PATH WE ARE ON. NOTHING IS BEYOND OUR CAPACITY. HONK YOUR HORN IF YOU WANT AMERICA TO LEAD AGAIN. HONK YOUR HORN IF YOU WANT AMERICANS TO TRUST EACH OTHER AGAIN. [HONKING] HONK YOUR HORN IF YOU WANT TO HAVE STABILITY AGAIN. [HONKING] AND HONK YOUR HORN IF YOU WANT AMERICA TO BE UNITED AGAIN. [HONKING] WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. YOU PLACED YOUR TRUST IN ME AND IN BARACK OBAMA AND WE WORKED FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. I WILL DO IT AGAIN. MY CAMPAIGN IS A BROAD COALITION OF DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, REPUBLICAN OFFICEHOLDERS. I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. [HONKING] I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO, BECAUSE THAT IS THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT. YOU HAVE A SACRED DUTY, THE DUTY TO VOTE. IT MATTERS. MINNESOTA MATTERS. STAY OPTIMISTIC, STAY UNITED. MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE. HELP GET OUT THE VOTE. AND GO ONLINE. THERE WAS A LAST-MINUTE CHANGE IN THE ROLES, ABSENTEE BALLOTS HAVE TO BE IN BY TUESDAY. DROP IT OFF, DO NOT PUT IT IN THE MAIL, OR VOTE SAFELY AND PERSON IN A DAY UP UNTIL ELECTION DAY, BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO GET IT DONE. AND MAKE SURE EVERYONE YOU KNOW VOTES AS WELL. SO THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP US, DESPITE TRUMP'S EFFORTS. A PRESS ARTICLE POINTS OUT THAT \"NEVER BEFORE IN MODERN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS , NEVER BEFORE IN MODERN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS HAS A CANDIDATE BEEN SO RELIANT ON WIDESPREAD EFFORTS TO REPRESS THE VOTE AS TRUMP.\" WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. OVER 85 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED. 85 MILLION. [HONKING] THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH. LOOK, I WILL NEVER FORGET THE WORDS PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID WHEN HE PROMISED TO SEND US TO THE MOON. HE SAID WE WERE DOING IT BECAUSE IN AMERICA WE REFUSE TO POSTPONE. I REFUSED TO POSTPONE THE WORK AMERICA MUST DO. THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY, NO LIMIT TO AMERICA, INCLUDING GUYS LIKE THAT. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN DOING SINCE THE BEGINNING. DIVIDING AMERICA, PITTING AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER BASED ON RACE, ETHNICITY, NATIONAL ORIGIN. THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. LET'S KEEP SHOWING HIM WHO WE ARE. [HONKING] WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. SCIENCE OVER FICTION. AND, YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES , OVER LIES. SO IT IS TIME TO STAND UP, TAKE BACK OUR DEMOCRACY. WE CAN DO THIS. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. WE CAN BE WHO WE ARE AT OUR BEST, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

TODAY HE IS JOINED BY FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. (music) HELLO, FLINT. ARE WE READY TO GO OUT AND WIN AN ELECTION? HOW WE READY TO BRING ALL OF OUR FRIENDS TO THE POLLS? I KNOW WE READY NOT JUST TO WIN, BUT ARE WE READY TO WIN BIG? WELL, I CAN FEEL IT. I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE AND I'M EXCITED, BECAUSE WE HAVE PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA READY TO COME OUT TO GREET US. [HONKING] WE ALSO HAVE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN, READY TO COME OUT AND GREET US. AND THEY ARE BOTH HERE BECAUSE THEY LOVE MICHIGAN AND THEY CERTAINLY LOVE THE CITY OF FLINT. AND WE KNOW THEY LOVE THIS DAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN HERE TIME AND TIME AGAIN. BUT THEY DON'T JUST SHOW UP TO VISIT AND WAVE THEIR HANDS AND DO SOME POLITICKING. WHEN THEY SHOW UP, GET THE BUSINESS DONE. THEY HAVE DONE THAT BEFORE, AND THEY WILL DO IT AGAIN. THEY HAVE SHOWN STABLE LEADERSHIP, THOUGHTFUL LEADERSHIP, FOCUSED LEADERSHIP. MAN, DO WE NEED THAT AGAIN OR WHAT? I JUST WANT TO TALK AGAIN ABOUT HOW WE SAW THEM TOGETHER AND HOW IT MADE A DIFFERENCE. IT IS PERSONAL TO ME. WHEN WE WERE FACING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, WALL STREET AGREED , WENT WILD AND ALMOST BROUGHT DOWN THE ENTIRE ECONOMY, IT WAS A MESS THAT BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN WALKED INTO. A MESS CREATED BY THE REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION THAT WAS THERE BEFORE. THEY CAME TO OUR CITY. HE CAME TO OUR STATE. AND WE KNOW THAT THE AUTO INDUSTRY WAS HANGING IN THE BALANCE, WITH ALL OF THOSE JOBS, ALL OF THAT HISTORY. THE STATE THAT PUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY ON WHEELS AND BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. ALL OF THAT WAS IN DANGER. I REMEMBER, I WAS A NEW MEMBER OF CONGRESS IN 2008, AND I REPRESENTED A DISTRICT THAT INCLUDED CHRYSLER. MANY OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE CHRYSLER HEADQUARTERS IN ANN ARBOR. I WILL NEVER FORGET THE MEETING I HAD WITH THE CEO. AND THEY WERE IN BIG TROUBLE ON THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER OR NOT THERE WOULD BE ANY ASSISTANCE FOR THE AUTO COMPANIES AND GENERAL MOTORS AND CHRYSLER. I REMEMBER THAT DISCUSSION WITH THAT CEO WHEN HE SAID, CONGRESSMAN, LET ME BE CLEAR. THE ECONOMY IS IN SHAMBLES, MONEY IS NOT AVAILABLE, AND I'M LITERALLY 4, 5, MAYBE SIX WEEKS AWAY FROM LIQUIDATING CHRYSLER. NOT REORGANIZING, LIQUIDATING. I LOOKED AROUND THAT ROOM AND THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE , I DON'T THINK THEY HAD HEARD FROM THE CEO THAT THIS COMPANY WAS GOING TO DISAPPEAR. I HAD VISIONS OF THAT GIANT PARKING LOT WITH GRASS GROWING IN IT, NO CARS. FAMILIES IN DIFFICULT SHAPE. I WENT BACK AND WORKED WITH COLLEAGUES AND TALKED TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN AND SAID, WE'VE GOT TO DO IT AND WE'VE GOT TO INCLUDE CHRYSLER. I WILL SAY TO THIS DAY, AND I WILL SAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, WHEN PEOPLE WERE BETTING AGAINST MICHIGAN WORKERS, WHEN DONALD TRUMP SET, HEY, LET DETROIT GO BANKRUPT , HE SAID THAT , WHEN VICE PRESIDENT PENCE WAS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND VOTED AGAINST THE AUTO RESCUE, I WILL SAY, THANK GOD BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN STILL WITH US. THEY STOOD WITH AMERICAN WORKERS. THEY STOOD WITH WORKERS IN MICHIGAN. THEY STOOD WITH WORKERS IN FLINT AND DETROIT. THEY WERE THERE FOR US WHEN WE NEEDED THEM, AND WE ARE GOING TO BE THERE FOR THEM NOW, BECAUSE WE NEED THEM BACK. [CAR HORNS HONKING] WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC THAT HAS LASTED A WHOLE LOT LONGER THAN ANY OF US WOULD LIKE. WE ARE STILL LOOKING FOR LEADERSHIP. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT HAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED IT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD DISAPPEAR AND PITTED STATES AGAINST EACH OTHER. HE DID NOT SHOW THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, BUT THANK GOD JOE BIDEN HAS A PLAN, THANK GOD HE WILL BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, AND THANK GOD WE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH HIM TO GET TO THIS CHALLENGE. , THROUGH THIS CHALLENGE. I WILL SAY THAT JOE BIDEN , HE CAN'T DO IT ALONE. HE NEEDS HELP. HE NEEDS FRIENDS. AND HE NEEDS FRIENDS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. HE NEEDS A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. [CAR HORNS HONKING] WE KNOW IF MITCH MCCONNELL STAYS AS REPUBLICAN LEADER, HE WILL STAND IN THE WAY OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY. WE SAW HIM DO IT WHEN BARACK OBAMA WAS PRESIDENT. WE CANNOT ALLOW HIM TO STAY, WHICH IS WHY WE MUST WIN. IT IS WHY WE MUST WIN HERE IN MICHIGAN. I HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU , WE HAVE A REAL SHOT. A SHOT TO TAKE THE MAJORITY. ONE THING WE MUST DO IS, WE MUST WIN HERE. WE MUST HOLD THIS SEAT, AND WE WILL HOLD THIS SEAT AS A DEMOCRATIC SEAT FOR MICHIGAN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. [CAR HORNS HONKING] NOW THE REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT THEY ARE POURING MONEY INTO MY RACE. YOU SEE THE TV COMMERCIALS. THERE ARE A LOT OF TV COMMERCIALS. THEY ARE POURING MONEY IN WITH NEGATIVE, NASTY, FALSE ADS. THE FALL , THE FACT CHECKER SAY THEY ARE FALSE OR SMEARS. MITCH MCCONNELL AND HIS BILLIONAIRE BUDDIES PUT IN $20 MILLION AND THE LAST FEW WEEKS, AND THIS WEEKEND THEY ARE GOING TO SPEND $8 MILLION. THESE ARE BILLIONAIRES THAT THINK THEY CAN BUY THE SELECTION. WE ALL KNOW, WE ARE ALL PROUD MICHIGANDERS, AND WE KNOW THAT WILLIAM AYRES CANNOT BUY AN ELECTION , THAT BILLIONAIRES CANNOT BUY AN ELECTION IN MICHIGAN. WE KNOW BILLIONAIRES HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. ONE OF THE MANY REASONS THIS COUNTRY IS SO GREAT , A BILLIONAIRE STILL GETS ONE VOTE. WE GET ONE VOTE AND WE HAVE MORE VOTES HERE TODAY IN FLINT THAN THOSE BILLIONAIRES. [CAR HORNS HONKING] BUT WE HAVE TO WORK. IT IS NOT OVER. LET ME WRAP UP BY RINGING A BAD MEMORY AND PAINTING A PICTURE OF WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE. WE REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016. WE REMEMBER WAKING UP THAT MORNING AND SEEING THE RESULTS. I KNOW EVERYONE HERE TODAY HAS THIS THOUGHT , WAS THERE SOMETHING MORE I COULD HAVE DONE? THE LOSS WAS ONLY TWO VOTES A PRECINCT. COULD I HAVE MADE A FEW MORE CALLS? COULD I HAVE TALKED TO MY NEIGHBOR? COULD I HAVE HAD A COUPLE FRIENDS, AND MAKE SURE THEY GET TO THE BALLOT? I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS FOR YOU. YOU LEAVE HERE TODAY, YOU STILL HAVE TIME TO DO THAT WORK. WHEN YOU WAKE UP TOMORROW, YOU CAN PUT IN THOSE TWO EXTRA HOURS OF WORK. YOU CAN TALK TO THOSE NEIGHBORS. YOU CAN TAKE TO THE POLLS A FRIEND OF YOURS. WE DO THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS, THIS WILL BE THE VISION I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH, THIS VISION BEFORE WE HEAR FROM SOME AMAZING PEOPLE. WHEN WE ARE WAITING FOR THE RESULTS OF THIS ELECTION, YOU ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE TV. THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE WATCHING, BECAUSE MICHIGAN IS THE CENTER OF THAT. WHEN THE RESULTS COME IN, WHEN THAT COMES ACROSS YOUR TV SCREEN, I KNOW WHAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL DO.

GOOD AFTERNOON. THANKS FOR HAVING ME AND FOR JOINING TODAY'S CAR RALLY. I WAS BORN AND RAISED HERE IN THE CITY OF FLINT, MICHIGAN AND HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY MY ENTIRE LIFE, ORGANIZING AND ENGAGING PEOPLE TO FIGHT FOR ENVIRONMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE FIGHT FOR CLEAN, AFFORDABLE WATER AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE. I GREW UP STRONG, WITH MY FAMILY WORKING AT GENERAL MOTORS, PROUD MEMBERS OF THE UAW. MY MOTHER WAS A UNION REPRESENTATIVE AND LIAISON FOR FLINT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. MY FAMILY AND MY COMMUNITY MOTIVATE ME TO STAY COMMITTED TO THE FIGHT FOR EQUITY, WHICH STARTS AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL. I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE THAT FIGHTING FOR CHANGE AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL IS MORE THAN JUST YOUR TYPICAL 9:00-5:00 JOB. IT IS YOUR WHOLE LIFE. RIGHT NOW, WE DESPERATELY NEED A PRESIDENT WHO RECOGNIZES THAT. THIS PANDEMIC HAS SHINED A LIGHT ON THE INEQUITIES THAT DEFINE OUR. EXISTENCE THIS PRESIDENT HAS USED HAS WORDS AND THE NATION'S HIGHEST OFFICE TO STOKE HATE AND DIVISION. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. THE SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK FOR US. , THIS SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK FOR US. WE ARE JUST THREE DAYS AWAY FROM A DAY WE WILL NEVER FORGET. THIS IS NO DOUBT THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIVES. AND WHEN NOVEMBER 4 ROLLS AROUND, WE NEED TO KNOW THAT WE LEFT IT ALL ON THE TABLE, THAT WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD TO ELECT THE LEADERS WE KNOW WE DESERVE. WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS RIGHT NOW AND MEETING THIS MOMENT MEANS EXERCISING YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE. IT MEANS TELLING YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO VOTE. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE YET TO VOTE, YOU CAN GO TO IWILL VOTE.COM TO MAKE YOUR PLAN TODAY. IF YOU CARE ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND THE WATER YOU DRINK, YOU NEED TO VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN. THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH TO SIT THIS ONE OUT. JOE BIDEN KNOWS THAT CHANGE STARTS AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL. HE KNOWS THAT THE BEST LAWS AND POLICIES DEMAND A PATIENT, ATTENTIVE EAR TO THE GROUND. HE WILL LISTEN. HE CARES ABOUT US. HE HELPED SAVE THE AUTO INDUSTRY, WHICH MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR THOUSANDS IN FLINT AND HE WILL BE MORE THAN A 9:00-5:00 PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES TO RIGHT THE SHIP. HERE IN FLINT, WE ARE NO STRANGERS TO A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AS OUR COUNTRY IN THE WORLD FEELS THE WEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC, WE ARE ALL LOOKING FOR HOPE AND LEADERSHIP TO MOVE US FORWARD. I REMEMBER A TIME WHERE WE SAW THAT SAME UNIQUE BRAND OF HOPE WHEN WE WERE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. WE USED OUR OWN POWER, MADE HISTORY, AND ELECTED THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I AM SO HONORED TO INTRODUCE THE MAN AND PRESIDENT WHO EMBODIES THAT HOPE, WHO FORGED A BRIGHT PATH FORWARD, BUT ONE HOUSEKEEPING ITEM BEFORE I WELCOME HIM TO THE STAGE. WE ASK THAT YOU PLEASE REFRAIN FROM HONKING YOUR HORNS DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S REMARKS. FLINT, PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING TO THE STAGE THE 44TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, BARACK OBAMA. (music) HELLO, FLINT. IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK IN MICHIGAN. IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK IN THE MIDWEST, GETTING CLOSER TO CHICAGO FROM HERE. HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING? CAN EVERYBODY GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO ANDRE YOUNG? FANTASTIC YOUNG MAN. THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION. HAPPY HALLOWEEN, EVERYBODY. I LOVE YOUR MASKS. [LAUGHTER] PLEASE GIVE A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE AS WELL TO GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GARLAND GILCHRIST. MY BUDDY FROM THE SENATE, DEBBIE STABENOW. A MAN WHO IS ALWAYS IN THERE FIGHTING FOR YOU WHO WE NEED TO SEND BACK TO THE SENATE, JARED PETERS. YOUR CONGRESSMAN, BORN AND RAISED GREAT HERE IN FLINT, MICHIGAN, DAN KILLED THE , DAN KILDEE. MAYOR SHELTON NEELY. , SHELDON NEELY. AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. THREE DAYS, FLINT. THREE DAYS UNTIL THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIMES. I LOVE YOU TOO. LISTEN, I KNOW RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE GOT THE MICHIGAN-MICHIGAN STATE GAME, AND THAT IS A BIG DEAL. THE PAUL BUNYAN TROPHY IS ON THE LINE, BUT THIS TUESDAY, EVERYTHING IS ON THE LINE. OUR JOBS ARE ON THE LINE, OUR HEALTH CARE IS ON THE LINE, WHETHER OR NOT WE GET THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL IS ON THE LINE, BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS. ON TUESDAY, YOU CAN CHOOSE CHANGE. ON TUESDAY, YOU CAN ELECT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. YOU CAN CHOOSE A BETTER AMERICA. AND WHAT IS EVEN BETTER NEWS IS YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL TUESDAY TO CAST YOUR BALLOT, MICHIGAN. YOU CAN VOTE IN PERSON RIGHT NOW. JUST GO TOWILLVOTE.COM, FIND YOUR POLLING PLACE, GET OUT THERE AND VOTE. IF SOMEBODY LIKE YOU ALREADY VOTED, GO HELP YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE. WE HAVE GOT TO GET EVERYBODY OUT THERE. I LOVE YOU TOO. OK, THAT'S IT. PUT THAT MASK BACK ON. LISTEN, MICHIGAN, JOE BIDEN IS MY BROTHER. I LOVE THAT , I LOVE JOE BIDEN AND HE WILL BE A GREAT PRESIDENT. NOW, I WILL ADMIT, 12 YEARS AGO, WHEN I ASKED HIM TO BE THE NOMINEE FOR VICE PRESIDENT WITH ME WHEN I WAS RUNNING, I DID NOT KNOW JOE THAT WELL. WE HAD SERVED TOGETHER IN THE SENATE, BUT HE AND I CAME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES, PART OF DIFFERENT GENERATIONS, BUT I QUICKLY CAME TO ADMIRE JOE AS A MAN WHO LEARNED EARLY ON TO TREAT EVERYBODY HE MEETS WITH DIGNITY AND WITH RESPECT, LIVING BY THE WORDS HIS MOM TAUGHT HIM \"NO ONE IS BETTER THAN YOU, JOE, BUT YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE.\" AND THAT SENSE OF DECENCY AND EMPATHY, A BELIEF IN HARD WORK, FAMILY, FAITH, THE BELIEF THAT EVERYBODY COUNTS, THAT IS WHO JOE IS. AND THAT IS WHO HE WILL BE AS PRESIDENT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE PRESIDENCY DOES NOT CHANGE WHO YOU ARE. IT SHOWS WHO YOU ARE. IT REVEALS WHO YOU ARE. AND FOR EIGHT YEARS, JOE WAS THE LAST ONE IN THE ROOM WHENEVER I FACED A BIG DECISION, AND HE MADE ME A BETTER PRESIDENT. HE HAS THE CHARACTER AND THE EXPERIENCE TO MAKE US A BETTER COUNTRY AND HE AND KAMALA WILL BE IN THE FIGHT NOT FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR EVERYONE OF US. AND WE SURE CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW, I SAID THIS BEFORE. I NEVER THOUGHT DONALD TRUMP WOULD EMBRACE MY VISION. HE DID NOT AGREE WITH MY POLICIES, BUT I DID HOPE HE WOULD SHOW SOME INTEREST IN THE JOB. HE MIGHT TAKE THE JOB SERIOUSLY. HE NEVER HAS. HE HAS NOT SHOWN ANY INTEREST IN DOING THE WORK OR HELPING ANYBODY BUT HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS OR TREATING THE PRESIDENCY IS ANYTHING MORE THAN A REALITY SHOW TO GIVE HIM THE ATTENTION THAT HE CRAVES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THE REST OF US HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES. ALMOST 230,000 AMERICANS ARE DEAD. MORE THAN 100,000 SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE CLOSED. ALMOST 300,000 JOBS ARE GONE IN MICHIGAN ALONE. AMERICA JUST HAD ITS SINGLE WORST WEEK OF NEW COVID CASES. AND WHAT IS HIS CLOSING ARGUMENT? HERE WE ARE, THE WORST WEEK, THIS WEEK. WE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS NOW FOR MONTHS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND FOR MONTHS AND HIS CLOSING ARGUMENT THIS WEEK IS THAT THE PRESS AND PEOPLE ARE TOO FOCUSED ON COVID. COVID, COVID, COVID HE IS COMPLAINING. HE IS JEALOUS OF COVID'S MEDIA COVERAGE. AND NOW HE IS ACCUSING DOCTORS OF PROFITING OFF THIS PANDEMIC. THINK OF THAT. HE SAID THIS JUST YESTERDAY. HE SAID DOCTORS ARE OVER BLOWING IT BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF IT. DOCTORS. HE CANNOT FATHOM, HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THAT SOMEBODY WOULD RISK THEIR LIFE TO SAVE OTHERS WITHOUT TRYING TO MAKE A PROFIT. HIS CHIEF OF STAFF SAYS WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. THAT IS A QUOTE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC. WE NOTICED, MR. CHIEF OF STAFF. WE UNDERSTAND YOU WILL NOT, BUT DO YOU KNOW WHO WILL? JOE BIDEN WELL WHEN WE ELECT HIM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. , WILL WHEN WE ELECT HIM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN REPUBLICANS WERE SAYING LET DETROIT GO BANKRUPT? REMEMBER THAT? THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE SAYING LET AMERICA GET COVID, BECAUSE THAT IS HOW THEY ARE ACTING. IF TRUMP WERE FOCUSED ON COVID FROM THE BEGINNING, CASES WOULD NOT BE REACHING NEW RECORD HIGHS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SOME OF THE PLACES HE HOLDS RALLIES HAVE SEEN NEW SPIKES AFTER HE LEAVES TOWN. THERE WAS JUST A STUDY BY STANFORD UNIVERSITY THAT JUST CAME OUT SHOWING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE GOTTEN SICK BECAUSE OF THESE RALLIES HE IS HOLDING. WHAT IS HIS OBSESSION, BY THE WAY, WITH CROWD SIZE? HAVE YOU NOTICED THIS? HE IS ALWAYS WORRIED , THIS IS THE ONE MEASURE HE HAS OF SUCCESS. HE IS STILL WORRYING ABOUT HIS INAUGURATION CROWD BEING SMALLER THAN MINE. IT REALLY BUGS HIM. HE STILL IS TALKING ABOUT THAT. DOES HE HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO WORRY ABOUT? DID NO ONE COME TO HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY WHEN HE WAS A KID? WAS HE TRAUMATIZED? WHAT'S WITH CROWDS? I HAVE HAD CROWDS BEFORE, YOU KNOW. I HAVE HAD QUITE A FEW, BUT WHEN A COUNTRY IS GOING THROUGH A PANDEMIC, THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WORRYING ABOUT. AND THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JOE BIDEN AND TRUMP RIGHT THERE. TRUMP CARES ABOUT FEEDING HIS EGO. JOE CARES ABOUT KEEPING YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SAFE. AND HE IS LESS INTERESTED IN FEEDING HIS EGO THAN MAKING SURE HE IS NOT GOING AROUND MAKING MORE PEOPLE SICK. THAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT FROM A PRESIDENT. YOU CAN EXPECT SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM A REALITY TV STAR, BUT FROM A PRESIDENT, YOU WANT THEM TO PUT YOU ABOVE THEIR OWN EGO. HERE'S THE TRUTH, MICHIGAN. THIS PANDEMIC WOULD HAVE BEEN CHALLENGING FOR ANY PRESIDENT, BUT THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THIS WHITE HOUSE HAS DONE ANYTHING BUT COMPLETELY SCREW THIS UP IS NONSENSE. CANADA IDENTIFIED ITS FIRST CASE THE SAME WEEK THAT THE U.S. DID, JUST A FEW MILES UP. I MAY NOT BE POINTING NORTH, BUT CANADA IS PRETTY CLOSE. OUR MORTALITY RATE IN THE UNITED STATES IS 2.5 TIMES HIGHER THAN CANADA. THINK ABOUT THAT. IF WE HAD THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS DYING IN CANADA AS WE DO HERE, NEARLY 90,000 AMERICANS WOULD HAVE DIED INSTEAD OF 230,000 AMERICANS. IF WE HAD HANDLED THIS PANDEMIC LIKE CANADA DID, 140,000 OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE TODAY. THINK ABOUT THAT. THINK ABOUT THAT. AND YET, DESPITE THAT, LAST WEEK, WHEN TRUMP WAS ASKED IF HE WOULD DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT, HE SAID \"NOT MUCH.\" REALLY? NOT MUCH? CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING. I UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT WAS ANXIOUS TO DOWNPLAY IT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GET CREDIT FOR THE ECONOMY HE INHERITED AND ZERO BLAME FOR THE PANDEMIC KIA GOURD, BUT IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. , PANDEMIC HE IGNORED, BUT IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. THE JOB DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. MAKING STUFF UP DOES NOT MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER. YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE A PLAN. YOU HAVE GOT TO PUT IN THE WORK. AND, ALONG WITH THE EXPERIENCE TO GET THINGS DONE, JOE BIDEN HAS CONCRETE PLANS AND POLICIES THAT WILL TURN OUR VISION OF A FAIRER, STRONGER COUNTRY A REALITY. JOE WILL NOT SCREW UP TESTING. HE WILL NOT CALL SCIENTIST IDIOTS. HE WILL NOT HOST SUPER SPREADER EVENTS. WHAT HE WILL DO IS GET THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL WITH A PLAN TO MAKE TESTING FREE AND WIDELY AVAILABLE, GETTING A VACCINE TO EVERY AMERICAN COST FREE, AND MAKING SURE OUR FRONTLINE HEROES NEVER HAVE TO ASK OTHER COUNTRIES FOR THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY NEED. THAT IS WHAT JOE BIDEN WILL DO. JOE'S PLAN WILL GUARANTEE PAID SICK LEAVE FOR WORKERS AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC. HE WILL MAKE SURE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES IN EVERY COMMUNITY, NOT JUST SOME, NOT JUST BIG CORPORATIONS, BUT SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HOLD OUR COMMUNITIES TOGETHER CAN REOPEN SAFELY. AMERICA CREATED 1.5 MILLION MORE JOBS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS OF THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION THEN IN HIS FIRST THREE YEARS AND THAT WAS BEFORE HE COULD BLAME THE PANDEMIC. JOE BIDEN AND I, WITH THE HELP OF A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS, RESCUE THE AUTO INDUSTRY. GARY PETERS WAS THERE. HE TOLD US TO BET ON MICHIGAN AND WE DID. AND MANUFACTURING IN MICHIGAN GREW BY 15% OVER OUR LAST FOUR YEARS. TRUMP PROMISED HE WOULD MAKE MICHIGAN THE MANUFACTURING HUB OF THE WORLD AGAIN. IT IS UP 1% UNDER HIS FIRST FOUR YEARS. 15% UNDER OBAMA-BIDEN, 1% UNDER HIM. THAT IS MICHIGAN. WE ADDED THE LONGEST STREAK OF JOB GROWTH IN AMERICAN HISTORY, BUT THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE HE INFLICTED MEANS THAT HE WILL BE THE ONLY PRESIDENT SINCE HERBERT HOOVER TO ACTUALLY LOSE JOBS. THAT IS A LONG TIME AGO. JOE BIDEN AND GARY PETERS KNOW THAT THE KEY TO WHAT IS , TO A STRONG ECONOMY IS NOT CUTTING TAXES FOR BILLIONAIRES. IT IS LIFTING THE PROSPECTS FOR WORKING AMERICANS. AND JOE HAS GOT A PLAN TO CREATE ONE MILLION NEW AUTO RELATED JOBS BY ACCELERATING ELECTRIC VEHICLE PRODUCTION. HE HAS A PLAN TO CREATE 10 MILLION GOOD CLEAN ENERGY JOBS AND FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE AND SECURE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. FLINT, MICHIGAN, YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. HE WILL PAY FOR HIS PLANS BY ROLLING BACK TRUMP'S TAX CUTS FOR BILLIONAIRES. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT. JOE SEES THIS , JOE SEIZED THIS MOMENT NOT TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE, BUT TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE MADE TOGETHER AND FINALLY MAKE LONG-OVERDUE CHANGES SO THAT OUR ECONOMY ACTUALLY MAKES LIFE A LITTLE EASIER FOR EVERYBODY, FOR THE WAITRESS TRYING TO RAISE A KID ON HER OWN, FOR THE STUDENT FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR CLASSES, FOR THE SHIP WORKER ALWAYS ON THE EDGE OF GETTING LAID OFF, WHERE THE CANCER SURVIVOR WHO IS WORRIED THAT HER PRE-EXISTING CONDITION PROTECTIONS WILL BE TAKEN AWAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE FOR A SECOND. LET'S TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE FOR THE SECOND. , THE SECOND. REPUBLICANS LOVE TO SAY RIGHT BEFORE ELECTIONS THAT THEY WILL TECH YOUR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THAT IS WHAT THEY SAY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? JOE AND I ACTUALLY PROTECTED THEM TENURES AGO WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. [HONKING] AND SINCE WE DID SO, WITH NO HELP FROM REPUBLICANS, NO VOTES FROM REPUBLICANS, REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED TO REPEAL OR UNDERMINE THE ACA 60 TIMES. 60 TIMES THEY HAVE TRIED TO TAKE PEOPLES HEALTH CARE AWAY. WHEN ASKED, WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT? YOU DON'T THINK THESE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE HEALTH CARE? \"NO, NO, WE HAVE A PLAN.\" EXCEPT IT HAS BEEN 10 YEARS AND THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE A PLAN. THEY ARE TRYING TO BAMBOOZLE YOU. INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY COMING UP WITH A PLAN, THEY HAVE ATTACKED THE ACA AT EVERY TURN. THEY HAVE DRIVEN UP COSTS, DRIVEN UP THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED. NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THE SUPREME COURT TO TAKE YOUR HEALTH CARE AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF PANDEMIC. IN THE MIDST, RIGHT AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE NEED HEALTH CARE. THEY SIDE ONTO A CASE RIGHT NOW IN THE SUPREME COURT WHERE THEY ARE , THEY SIGNED ON TO A CASE RIGHT NOW IN THE SUPREME COURT WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY THE ACA WITH NOTHING TO TAKE ITS PLACE. MITCH MCCONNELL IS POURING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUPER PAC DOLLARS INTO MICHIGAN TO TRY TO BE GARY PETERS. MICHIGAN, HERE IS THE TRUTH. JOE AND KAMALA AND GARY WILL PROTECT YOUR HEALTH CARE, EXPANDED MEDICARE, MAKE INSURANCE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYBODY, AND THE REASON YOU KNOW THAT IS TRUE IS BECAUSE THEY WERE THERE WHEN WE DID IT THE FIRST TIME. AND HERE IS ANOTHER THING. WITH JOE AND KAMALA AT THE HELM, THIS IS A BIG BENEFIT. MICHELLE AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS OVER DINNER THE OTHER DAY. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THEM EVERY DAY. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO ARGUE WITH YOUR FAMILY ABOUT THEM EVERY DAY. IT WILL NOT BE SO EXHAUSTING. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE KNOWING THAT THE PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING TO SUGGEST WE INJECT BLEACH AS A POSSIBLE CURE OF COVID. HE WILL NOT WAKE UP IN THE MORNING , YOU WILL NOT WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, OPEN YOUR PHONE, NEWSFLASH, A CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT THE NAVY SEALS DID NOT ACTUALLY KILL BIN LADEN. YOU WILL NOT HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT WILL GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO INSULT PEOPLE THAT DO NOT SUPPORT HIM. THIS IS NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR. WE WOULD NOT TOLERATE IT FROM A TEACHER, A COACH, A COWORKER OR A FAMILY MEMBER IF A NEIGHBOR WAS ACTING LIKE THIS, YOU WOULD STAY AWAY FROM THE NEIGHBOR. WHY WOULD BE ACCEPTED FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? , WE ACCEPT IT FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? AND THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES. IT IS NOT JUST A JOKE. IT IS NOT JUST FUNNY. THOSE ACTIONS EMBOLDEN OTHER PEOPLE TO BE MEAN AND DIVISIVE AND RACIST. IT AFFECTS THE FABRIC OF ALL OF OUR LIVES IN HOWARD CHILDREN SEE THE WORLD , LIVES AND HOW OUR CHILDREN SEE THE WORLD, HOW OUR FAMILY GETS ALONG, HOW THE WORLD SEES AMERICA. THAT IS WHY JOE TALKS ABOUT THE SOUL OF AMERICA. THAT IS WHY HE TALKS ABOUT DECENCY AND KINDNESS AND RESPONSIBILITY AND HARD WORK. THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING IS WHAT SEPARATES JOE BIDEN FROM HIS OPPONENT. HE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT EVERY AMERICAN. HE DOES NOT HAVE A MEAN-SPIRITED BONE IN HIS BODY. I HAVE SEEN HIM SPEND TIME WITH PEOPLE, STRANGERS, THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW WHEN HE HEARS ABOUT THEIR HARDSHIP. HE TALKS ABOUT WHAT HE HAS GONE THROUGH. WHEN HE SEES A KID, HIS EYES LIGHT UP BECAUSE HE THINKS ABOUT HIS OWN KIDS AND GRANDKIDS. JOE BIDEN TRIES TO LIVE THE VALUES WE CHERISH , HONESTY, HARD WORK, KINDNESS, HUMILITY, RESPONSIBILITY, HELPING SOMEBODY ELSE OUT. THAT USED TO BE THE DEFINITION OF MANLINESS, NOT STRUTTING AND SHOWING OFF, ACTING IMPORTANT, BULLYING PEOPLE. IT USED TO BE BEING A MAN MEANT TAKING CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE, NOT GOING AROUND BRAGGING, BUT DOING THE WORK. NOT LOOKING FOR CREDIT. TRYING TO LIBERATE , TO LIVE RIGHT, PASSING ALONG THOSE VALUES TO YOUR KIDS, LOOKING OUT FOR COMMUNITY, CARRYING YOUR WEIGHT, GIVING UP A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO HELP SOMEBODY WHO HAS A REAL NEED. WHEN YOU ELECT JOE, THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL SEE REFLECTED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THOUGH SHOULD NOT BE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC VALUES. THEY DID NOT USED TO BE. THEY ARE WHAT WE GROW UP LEARNING FROM OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS. AND THEY ARE THE VALUES WE STILL TRY TO TEACH OUR KIDS. THEY ARE NOT WHITE OR BLACK OR HISPANIC OR ASIAN OR NATIVE AMERICAN VALUES, THEY ARE AMERICAN VALUES, AND WE HAVE GOT TO RECLAIM THEM RIGHT NOW, BUT TO RECLAIM THEM, WE WILL HAVE TO TURN OUT LIKE NEVER BEFORE. IF WE ARE GOING TO RECLAIM THOSE VALUES, WE NEED TO LEAVE NO DOUBT. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT. NOT THIS TIME.. NOT IN THIS ELECTION. WE GOT A LITTLE COMPLACENT THE LAST ELECTION. LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND WHY AMERICANS GET FRUSTRATED AND SOMETIMES THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, VOTING WILL NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I UNDERSTAND THAT. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT PERFECT, EVEN WHEN IT IS WORKING. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM, BUT WE CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER. A PRESIDENT CANNOT BY HIMSELF SOLVE EVERY CHALLENGE FACING THE ECONOMY HERE IN FLINT OR MICHIGAN, BUT IF WE ELECT PEOPLE LIKE GARY PETERS AND DAN KILDEE AND IF WE GET A HOUSE AND A SENATE JOINT WITH THE WHITE HOUSE THAT ARE MORE FOCUSED ON WORKING PEOPLE AND GETTING YOU THE HELP THAT THEY NEED , THAT YOU NEED, THEY WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND FOLKS WILL HAVE HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE. A PRESIDENT BY HIMSELF CANNOT ELIMINATE ALL RACIAL BIAS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, BUT IF WE ELECT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND STATE ATTORNEYS AND SHERIFFS FOCUSED ON EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AND WE ONCE AGAIN HAVE A CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT CARES ABOUT THESE ISSUES, WE CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER. AND THAT IS WHAT VOTING IS ABOUT, NOT MAKING THINGS PERFECT BUT MAKING THINGS BETTER. IT PUTS US ON A TRACK SO THAT GENERATIONS FROM NOW, WE CAN LOOK BACK AND SAY, RIGHT ABOUT THEN, THINGS STARTED GETTING BETTER AGAIN. THE FACT THAT YOU DO NOT GET 100% OF WHAT YOU WANT RIGHT AWAY IS NOT A GOOD REASON TO VOTE. YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP ADDED. , AT IT. TYPICALLY, JUST OVER 50% OF US VOTE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE. ALMOST HALF OF THE PEOPLE IN MOST ELECTIONS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE DO NOT VOTE. IMAGINE IF 60% OF US VOTED. IMAGINE IF 70% OF US VOTED. IMAGINE, JANUARY 20, WHEN WE SWEAR IN A PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT WHO HAVE A PLAN TO GET US OUT OF THIS MESS, WHO CARE ABOUT FOLKS LIKE YOU, WHO HAVE BEEN IN YOUR SHOES, WHO KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO STRUGGLE, WHAT IT IS LIKE TO WORK HARD, WHO THINK ABOUT WORKING AMERICANS AND HAVE A PLAN TO HELP YOU GET AHEAD. IMAGINE WHAT'LL BE LIKE TO , WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVE AND SCIENCE AND WHO BELIEVE IN RACIAL EQUALITY AND ARE SENDING A CLEAR SIGNAL THAT WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER AND ARE DOING THE WORK TO BRING US CLOSER SO THAT WE HAVE IN AMERICA WHERE NO MATTER WHAT WE LOOK LIKE OR WHERE WE COME FROM OR WHO WE LOVE OR HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAVE, WE CAN MAKE IT. AND WE HAVE A PLACE WHERE WE ARE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. I AM ASKING YOU TO REMEMBER THAT'S POSSIBLE. I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER WHAT THIS COUNTRY CAN BE, BUT YOU CANNOT JUST IMAGINE A BETTER FUTURE. YOU CANNOT JUST WISH FOR IT. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. WE HAVE TO OUT HUSSLE THE OTHER SIDE , OUT HUS THE OTHER SIDETLE , WE HAVE TO OUT HUSTLE THE OTHER SIDE, LEAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT WHO WE ARE INTO THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR. IF WE DO, WE WILL SEND GARY PETERS BACK TO THE SENATE AND WE WILL ELECT A MAN WHO LOVES THIS COUNTRY AND WHO CARES ABOUT YOU AND WHO WILL FIGHT FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US AND LOOK OUT NOT JUST FOR FOLKS WHO SUPPORT HIM BUT EVEN THE FOLKS WHO DO NOT. MY FRIENDS, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IT KIND OF REMINDS YOU OF HOW GOOD IT CAN BE LISTENING TO HIM, DOESN'T IT? GOD LOVE HIM. HE IS A GOOD MAN. FOLKS, IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK WITH FRIENDS. NEELY, GOVERNOR WHITMER, DEBBIE STABENOW, MY BUDDY, GARY PETERS, WHO YOU WILL SEND BACK TO THE SENATE, BECAUSE I AM GOING TO NEED HIM. YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON HIM TO BE A SENATOR FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. MY GOOD FRIEND, CONGRESSMAN DAN KILDY, A GOOD MAN. AND, OF COURSE, I WISH WE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO SEND BACK A GUY WHO WE USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION UP IN SCRANTON WE WOULD SAY WHEN SOMEBODY WASN'T SOMEBODY ELSE'S EQUAL. WE WOULD SAY, HE WAS NOT A PATCH ON HIS JEANS. MR. PRESIDENT, YOU WERE STILL DRIVING HIM CRAZY BECAUSE HE IS NOT A PATCH ON YOUR JEANS. BARACK OBAMA, IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH THE PRESIDENT AGAIN. IT IS A REMINDER OF A PRESIDENT OF CHARACTER, RESPECTIVE, TO OUR KIDS LOOKED UP TO IN LOOK UP TO. , AND LOOK UP TO. BARACK OBAMA WAS A GREAT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE SAY AGAIN TODAY, MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. WE WENT THROUGH EIGHT YEARS WITHOUT ONE SINGLE TRACE OF SCANDAL. NOT ONE SINGLE TRACE OF SCANDAL. IT WILL BE NICE TO RETURN TO THAT. FLINT, THREE DAYS. THREE DAYS. WE CAN PUT AN END TO THIS PRESIDENCY WE HAVE NOW THAT HAS DIVIDED THE NATION. THREE DAYS. WE CAN PUT AN END TO A PRESIDENCY THAT HAS FAILED TO PROTECT THIS NATION. THREE DAYS. WE CAN PUT AN END TO THE PRESIDENCY THAT HAS FANNED THE FLAMES OF HATE ALL ACROSS THIS NATION AND MADE US A LAUGHING STOCK AROUND THE WORLD. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY VOTED. MILLIONS MORE ARE VOTING TODAY, TOMORROW, AND, GOD WILLING, ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE CLOSE OF THE POLLS ON TUESDAY. AND MY MESSAGE IS SIMPLE. THE POWER TO CHANGE THE COUNTRY IS NOT FIGURATIVELY, IT IS LITERALLY IN YOUR HANDS. I DO NOT CARE HOW HARD DONALD TRUMP TRIES, THERE IS NOTHING , LET ME SAY IT AGAIN , THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO TO STOP THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION FROM VOTING IN OVERWHELMING NUMBERS AND TAKING BACK THIS MARKER SEE. AND WHEN AMERICANS VOTE, NO MATTER HOW MANY THREATS HE MAKES, AMERICA WILL BE HEARD. WHEN AMERICA IS HEARD, I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE WILL BE ALLOWED AND IT IS GOING TO BE CLEAR. IT IS TIME FOR DONALD TRUMP TO PACK HIS BAGS AND GO HOME. WE ARE DONE WITH THE CHAOS, THE TWEETS, THE ANGER, THE HATE, THE FAILURE, THE REFUSAL TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY. WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AND IF I AM ELECTED YOUR PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO DO IT. WE ARE GOING TO ACT. WE ARE GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP IN DOING IT AS WELL. WE WILL HAVE TO GET COVID UNDER CONTROL. ON DAY ONE OF MY PRESIDENCY, I WILL PUT INTO ACTION A PLAN I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR MONTHS, ALREADY LAID OUT, NATIONAL MANDATE, MASK WEARING, SOCIAL DISTANCING, TESTING, TRACING, ALL THINGS, AS PRESIDENT OBAMA JUST SAID, COULD AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE MONTHS AGO. THE PLAN INCLUDES FULL, FAIR, AND FREE DISTRIBUTION OF THERAPEUTICS AND A VACCINE WHEN WE GET ONE. IMAGINE WHERE WE WOULD BE IF WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO WORE A MASK INSTEAD OF MOCKING IT. I CAN TELL YOU THIS. WE WOULD NOT HAVE 9 MILLION CONFIRMED CASES OF COBIT IN THIS NATION , CASES OF COVID IN THIS NATION. 90,000 CASES TODAY, YESTERDAY. BY THE WAY, 500,000 IN THE PAST WEEK. THIS GUY TELLS US IT IS GOING AWAY. WHAT MAKES IT GO AWAY IS IF HE GOES AWAY. FOLKS, WE WOULD NOT BE FACING ANOTHER 200,000 DEATHS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THIS PRESIDENT KNEW IN JANUARY THE VIRUS WAS DEADLY AND TRIED TO IMPROVE HIS IMAGE. HE TRIED TO TALK TO BOB WOODWARD. HE THOUGHT HE COULD CHANGE HIS MIND. BUT WHAT HE DID IT, HE LET IT BE KNOWN, ALL THE WAY BACK IN JANUARY, HE KNEW HOW DANGEROUS THIS WAS AND HE HIT IT FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE KNEW IT WAS WORSE THAN THE FLU, BUT HE LIED FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE KNEW IT WOULD NOT DISAPPEAR, BUT HE KEPT TELLING US A MIRACLE WAS COMING. YESTERDAY, HE HAD THE GALL TO SUGGEST THAT AMERICAN DOCTORS, PEOPLE WHO ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE ON THE FRONT LINES TO SAVE OTHER LIVES, ALONG WITH NURSES AND SO MANY OTHERS, HE SUGGESTED FALSELY THAT THEY ARE INFLATING THE NUMBER OF COVID DEATHS TO MAKE MORE MONEY. WHAT IN THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS MAN? EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE, BUT THINK ABOUT IT. IT IS PERVERTED. HE MAY BELIEVE IT BECAUSE HE DOES NOT DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN FOR MONEY. PEOPLE IN THIS NATION HAVE SUFFERED AND SACRIFICED FOR NINE MONTHS, NONE MORE SO THAN THE DOCTORS ON THE FRONT LINES IN HEALTH CARE WORKERS, AND THIS PRESIDENT IS QUESTIONING THEIR CHARACTER, THEIR INTEGRITY, THEIR COMMITMENT TO THEIR FELLOW AMERICANS. IT IS MORE THAN OFFENSIVE. IT IS A DISGRACE, ESPECIALLY COMING FROM A PRESIDENT WHO HAS WAVED THE WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER TO THIS VIRUS. OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE GIVEN THEIR ALL TO BEAT THE VIRUS. THE PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN UP. I WILL NEVER RAISE THE WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER. WE WILL BEAT THIS VIRUS AND WE WILL GET IT UNDER CONTROL. IN THE FIRST STEP TO DOING THAT , AND THE FIRST STEP TO DOING THAT IS BEATING DONALD TRUMP. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP KEEPS TELLING US WHAT A GREAT JOB HE HAS DONE AS PRESIDENT. OH, MAN. WELL, DID YOU KNOW THAT PRESIDENT AND , PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I CREATED MORE JOBS IN OUR FIRST YEAR THAN HE DID IN HIS FIRST THREE? HOW ABOUT THIS? DONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN 90 YEARS TO FINISH HIS TERM WITH FEWER JOBS UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP THAN WHEN HE STARTED. LOOK, THAT IS A LOT OF PRESIDENTS. THAT IS A LOT OF CRISES, BUT ONLY DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE FEWER JOBS AT THE END OF HIS PRESIDENCY THAN WHEN HE STARTED. BC , YOU SEE, I AND BARACK UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY, YOU DID. WORKING PEOPLE BUILT THIS COUNTRY AND UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. HE IS GOING TO WAGE WAR ON AMERICAN LABOR. I SEE THE UAW SIGN OUT THERE. THEY FIRST ENDORSED ME WHEN I WAS A 29-YEAR-OLD KID, GOD LOVE YOU. LOOK, WE HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW. WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE PORTING WORK, NOT WEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY. UNDER MY PLAN, IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR, YOU WILL NOT PAY A PENNY IN ADDITIONAL TAXES, BUT THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE, THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS, 91 OF THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES PAY , PAID ZERO AND FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAST YEAR. THEY WILL START TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. THEY WILL PAY THE SAME RATE THEY DID AT THE BEGINNING OF GEORGE BUSH'S ADMINISTRATION. INCORPORATIONS WILL START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. , AND CORPORATIONS WILL START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. WHY SHARE , SHOULD A NURSE PAY A HIGHER TAX RATE THAN SOMEONE? MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS WHY SHOULD YOU PAY MORE TAXES THAN DONALD TRUMP? HE PAID $75 IN TAXES THE YEAR WE KNOW OF. I RELEASED 22 YEARS OF MY TAX RETURNS. YOU CAN GO ONLINE AND LOOK. HE HAS NOT RELEASED ONE. HE TALKS ABOUT CORRUPTION. WHAT IS HE HIDING? HE OWES $41 MILLION. WHO DOES HE OWE IT TO? IF YOU HAVE NOTICED, HE IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT I KNOW OF THAT HAS A SECRET BANK ACCOUNT IN CHINA. HE PAID 50 TIMES MORE TAXES IN BEIJING THEN HE HAS PAID IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THIS GUY TALKS ABOUT CORRUPTION? LOOK, WE WILL ALSO ACT TO PROTECT HEALTH CARE. TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS JUST JAMMED THROUGH A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE FOR ONE OVERWHELMING REASON. LIKE BARACK SAID, THE PRESIDENT SAID, THEY HAVE TRIED OVER 50 SHOTS TO TAKE OUT OBAMACARE, DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, BUT THEY WILL BE IN COURT, I BELIEVE IN SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION, WIN OR LOSE THEY WILL BE IN COURT. IF THEY GET THEIR WAY, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MORE THAN 4 MILLION MICHIGANDERS. DONALD TRUMP THINKS HEALTH CARE IS A PRIVILEGE. BARACK AND I THINK IT IS A RIGHT FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE HEALTH CARE. WE WILL NOT ONLY RESTORE OBAMACARE, WE WILL BUILD ON IT. WE WILL KEEP YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE IF YOU LIKE IT, AND YOU CAN CHOOSE A MEDICARE LIKE PUBLIC OPTION IF YOU DO NOT. WE WILL LOWER PREMIUMS, DEDUCTIBLES, OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING. REDUCE PRESCRIPTION JUG COST BY 60%. , DRUG COST BY 60%. WE WILL KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP LAID OUT IF , OUT WHAT HE WILL DO IN HIS SECOND TERM TO SOCIAL SECURITY. THE ACTUARY OF SOCIAL SECURITY SAYS IF YOU GET THAT PASSED, IT WILL BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BY 2023, SOMETHING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LIVE ON, PAID FOR FOR THEIR WHOLE LIFE. I SAID SIX YEARS AGO, REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE MEDICARE. THEY SAID THAT IS CRAZY. THE FIRST THING PAUL RYAN AND THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS DID WAS TRY TO CUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF MEDICARE. THESE GUYS MEAN WHAT THEY SAY. I AM GOING TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, AND MEDICAID. IT IS A LIFELINE FOR SO MANY HARD-WORKING FOLKS. BUT, FOLKS, I HAVE TO ADMIT TO YOU , THIS IS KIND OF PERSONAL WITH ME , THERE IS NOTHING WORSE THAN THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN MY VIEW THAN THE WAY HE SPEAKS ABOUT OUR WOMEN AND MEN IN UNIFORM AND THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES. HE CALLED THEM LOSERS AND SUCKERS. MY SON BEAU WAS A MAJOR IN THE U.S. ARMY. HE GAVE UP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S JOB AND PETITION TO BE ABLE TO GO WITH HIS UNIT TO IRAQ FOR ONE SOLID YEAR. BEING IN KOSOVO, I MIGHT ADD , I WILL BE ATYPICAL DAD , HE IS THE ONLY FOREIGNER IN KOSOVO THAT HAS A MEMORIAL DID , A MEMORIAL DEDICATED TO HIM, THE HIGHWAY, THE BEAU BIDEN HIGHWAY, DEDICATED TO HIM BECAUSE OF HIS COMMITMENT. GUESS WHAT? HE WAS NOT A SUCKER OR LOSER, NOR ARE ANY OF YOU WHO SERVED. YOU ARE PATRIOTS. THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO PORTRAY HIMSELF , I LOVE THIS. HE LIKES TO PORTRAY HIMSELF AS A TOUGH GUY. ANYWAY, A MACHO MAN. BUT WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU READ ABOUT, SAW, HEARD ABOUT A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES LITERALLY BEING LAUGHED AT BY WORLD LEADERS WHEN HE SPOKE TO THE UNITED NATIONS? LAUGHED AT OUT LOUD. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BEING OPENLY MOCKED BY THE LEADERS OF NATO AT A NATO CONFERENCE? AND CAN YOU BELIEVE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO ACTS LIKE VLADIMIR PUTIN'S PUPPY? PUTIN PUT BOUNTIES ON THE HEADS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS SERVING IN IRAQ, AND TRUMP WAS TOO SCARED TO CHALLENGE HIM. HE NEVER MENTIONED IT. TRUMP IS NOT STRONG. HE IS WEAK. HE COMMANDS LITTLE RESPECT ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO NOT ONLY DOES NOT UNDERSTAND SACRIFICE, HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND COURAGE, THE PHYSICAL COURAGE IT TAKES TO SERVE IN UNIFORM IN A WAR ZONE. MAYBE THAT IS WHY SIX GENERALS AND ADMIRALS WHO WORKED FOR HIM HIS ADMINISTRATION AND SAID HE WAS UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME ANY PRESIDENT HAS HAD THAT HAPPEN? TOUGH GUY. THAT IS WHY SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND OR GENERAL CHRISMAN, THAT IS WHY THE HEAD OF THE NAVY SEALS, AND 22 OTHER FOUR STARS SUPPORT ME. BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE WILL RESPECT THEM, WE WILL SUPPORT THEM. I HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT OF WAR ZONES AS SENATOR AND VICE PRESIDENT OVER 35 TIMES. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, THESE FOLKS WE HAVE, ONLY 1% OF THE COUNTRY IS IN THE MILITARY. WE OVER THEM. THEY ARE THE BACKBONE, THE SINEW, THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO SUPPORT OUR MILITARY AND GET RID OF TRUMP. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. THINK ABOUT THIS. THIS IS A GUY WHO SAYS THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CLIMATE CHANGE. HE CALLS IT A HOAX. I SEE IT AS JOBS, HEALTH, AND SAFETY. THE IMPACTS ON CLIMATE ART , ON CLIMATE TOO OFTEN FALL DISPROPORTIONATELY ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE WILL MAKE SURE THEY BENEFIT FROM THE BILLIONS OF FEDERAL INVESTMENT WE WILL DO. WE WILL CREATE LOCAL JOBS TO REBUILD ROADS, BUILD SIDEWALKS, INSTALL BROADBAND, CREATE PLACES TO LIVE AND WORK SAFELY, MODERNIZE INFRASTRUCTURE SO YOU CAN TURN ON THE WATER AND CLEAN WATER COMES OUT, SO THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN FLINT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN IN AMERICA. WE CAN AND MUST DO THIS. DONALD TRUMP HAS ROLLED BACK MORE THAN 100 ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION LAWS, MANY ENACTED UNDER BARACK AND ME. IT WILL ALSO HOLD POLLUTERS ACCOUNTABLE WITH THE MOST AMBITIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL PLAN EVER. PROTESTING IS NOT BURNING OR POLLUTING. VIOLENCE CANNOT BE TOLERATED AND IT WON'T, BUT THESE PROTESTS ARE A CRY FOR JUSTICE. THE NAMES OF GEORGE FLOYD, BREONNA TAYLOR, JACOB BLAKE, WILL INSPIRE A NEW WAVE OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA. AMERICANS HAVE THEIR EYES OPENED UP. THEY ARE READY. LOOK, I BELIEVE THIS COUNTRY HAS TO COME TOGETHER. I KNOW WHEN I ANNOUNCED A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO WHEN I SAID I WANTED TO UNITE THE COUNTRY, EVERYBODY SAID THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. YOU DID IT BEFORE, YOU CANNOT DO IT AGAIN. WELL, WE CAN AND WE MUST WE HAVE NO CHOICE. THAT IS HOW DEMOCRACIES WORK. I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO. THAT IS THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT. IT IS A DUTY TO CARE, A DUTY TO CARE FOR EVERYONE, SO PLEASE VOTE. IF YOU STILL HAVE AN ABSENTEE BALLOT, GET IT TO A DROPBOX AS SOON AS YOU CAN. YOU CAN ALSO SAFELY VOTE EARLY UNTIL MONDAY AFTERNOON OR ON ELECTION DAY. JUST MAKE A PLAN. HELP GET OUT THE VOTE. AS YOU HAVE HEARD 10 TIMES ALREADY. VISIT IWILLVOTE.COM\/MI. FOLKS, WE HAVE SUCH AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY. GOD LOVE YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT HERE'S THE DEAL, GUYS. WE HAVE GOT TO VOTE UP AND DOWN THE TICKET HERE. I, HONEST TO GOD, BELIEVE , I GIVE YOU MY WORD , I BELIEVE WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT. WE HAD THE CHANCE TO MAKE SUCH ENORMOUS PROGRESS BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN WHAT THE OTHER LOOKS LIKE. THEY HAVE GOTTEN A GLIMPSE OF THE ABYSS. I MEAN IT APPEARED THEY ARE READY TO CHANGE SO MUCH. I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID WHEN HE PROMISED TO SEND US TO THE MOON, A PHRASE THAT GUIDED ME. HE SAID, WE ARE DOING IT BECAUSE WE \"REFUSED TO POSTPONE.\" I REFUSE TO POSTPONE THE INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO AMERICA'S FUTURE. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN DOING FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS CAMPAIGN, DIVIDING AMERICA, PITTING AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER BASED ON RACE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, NATIONAL ORIGIN. IT IS WRONG. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. LET'S KEEP SHOWING THEM WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR, WE CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION, WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION. AND, YES, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVER LIES. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, IT IS TIME FOR US TO STAND BACK AND STAND UP AND TAKE BACK OUR DEMOCRACY. WE CAN DO THIS. WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN WE HAVE BEEN. WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD TECH OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

SPEAKING TO BLACK RELIGIOUS LEADERS AT A SOUL TO THE POLLS RALLY, AND EFFORT BY BLACK CHURCHES TO MOBILIZE VOTERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. MR. BIDEN TOUTS HIS CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE AND ECONOMIC PLANS, AND HE URGED SUPPORTERS TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR RACIAL JUSTICE. PRESIDENT TRUMP NARROWLY WON PENNSYLVANIA FOUR YEARS AGO. POLLS INDICATE A CLOSE RACE THIS YEAR. (music) [HORNS HONKING] WE GREET YOU THIS AFTERNOON FOR A VERY SERIOUS MOMENT. IT IS TIME FOR US TO HEAR THE VOICE OF A LEADER. IT IS TIME FOR US TO HEAR LEADERS THAT WILL GUIDE THIS NATION THROUGH THE FOREST OF BIGOTRY. A LEADER WHO KNOWS HOW TO BUILD BRIDGES THAT UNITE US AND NOT BUILD WALLS THAT DIVIDE. THIS INDIVIDUAL LEADER NEEDS TO BE ONE THAT COMES FROM MORE OF A BIBLICAL MOTIFF, AND THAT IS HE NEEDS TO BE A SERVANT. A SERVANT IS ONE THAT SERVES OTHERS MORE THAN THEY DO THESE , DO THEMSELVES. HE HAS SERVED NEXT TO THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, BARACK OBAMA. FOR TWO TERMS. HE IS A SERVANT BECAUSE HE HAS SERVED NOT ONLY NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, BUT HE HAS SERVED IN THE PLACE CALLED THE SENATE BEING A SENATOR. HIS YEARS OF SERVING HAVE BEEN OVER 40 YEARS IN PUBLIC OFFICE. NOT ONLY WILL IT TAKE A SERVANT, BUT IT WILL ALSO TAKE A SUFFERER, SOMEONE WHO FEELS WHAT WE FEEL. HE HIS ONE THAT HAS , HE IS ONE THAT HAS SUFFERED THE TRAGEDY OF DEATH IN HIS OWN LIFE , A WIFE, A SON, AND THEREFORE HE CAN SYMPATHIZE WITH OTHER SUFFERERS. HERE IN OUR OWN COUNTRY. THOUSANDS, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH CORONAVIRUS. I KNOW HE FEELS LET BECAUSE , I KNOW HE FEELS THAT BECAUSE HE IS A SUFFERER. I KNOW HE FEELS THE DEATH OF MANY, OVER 250,000 INDIVIDUALS HAVE DIED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND BECAUSE HE HAS EXPERIENCED DEATH HIMSELF, HE CAN RELATE TO THE DEATH OF MANY LIVES THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NOT ONLY MUST HE BE A SERVANT, NOT ONLY MUST HE BE A SUFFERER, BUT HE ALSO MUST BE A SUSTAINER, SOMEBODY THAT IS ABLE TO GET BACK ON TRACK WHO HAVE FALLEN OFF THE TRACK. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT ALL OF US REMEMBER 2008, WHEN THEY GAVE OVER THIS COUNTRY TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND TO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. WHAT I WOULD CALL A SINKING TITANIC.ECONOMICALLY WE WERE IN THE WATERS OF RECESSION. SOME SAID VERY CLOSE TO ANOTHER DEPRESSION. BUT SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY, THEY GOT TOGETHER, PLUGGED UP THE HOLES, PULLED THIS SINKING TITANIC OUT OF THE WATERS AND GUIDED US BACK TO THE SHORES THAT WE HAVE HAD SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN IN. SO I SAY TO YOU, AND I SAY TO ALL OF US, THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO GET BACK TO WHAT WE USED TO BE, IT IS GOING TO TAKE A SERVANT. IT IS GOING TO TAKE SOMEONE WHO IS A SUFFERER AND A SUSTAINER, AND I DO BELIEVE THAT IN THE PERSON OF VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND HIS COMPOSITE RATE, HIS , HIS COMPADRE, HIS PARTNER, SISTER HARRIS, WILL BE WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE CAME FROM AND NOT GO BACK TO WHERE WE USED TO BE. SO I INTRODUCE TO YOU THE VICE PRESIDENT, THE CANDIDATE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. (music) HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. [HORNS HONKING] HELLO. HELLO, PHILADELPHIA. IT IS GREAT TO SEE EVERYONE. I WANT TO THANK SHARON BAPTIST CHURCH FOR LETTING US BORROW YOUR PARKING LOT. AND THE DNC CHAIR, VICE CHAIR. I TELL YOU WHAT, THAT MAN CAN MAKE A SPEECH, CAN'T HE? VICE CHAIR BLAKE, FOR ALL YOU DO, FOR OUR PARTY, AND ALL YOU DO TO GET OUT THE VOTE. I THANK YOU, CONGRESSMAN DWIGHT EVANS, FOR COMING OUT AND SPEAKING TODAY, AND ALL YOU DO TO FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OF PHILADELPHIA EVERYTHING WILL DAY IN CONGRESS. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO BISHOP HUNTER, AND REVEREND MARK TYLER, STATE REPRESENTATIVES. WHERE IS MORGAN? THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AND BISHOP LEWIS FELTON. I ALSO WANT TO THANK SHARON BAPTIST CHURCH CHOIR. AREN'T THEY GREAT? [HONKING] ONE OF THE THINGS I MOST ENJOYED ABOUT BEING BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WAS MEETING WITH BLACK FAITH LEADERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE CHURCHES I GET TO GO TO DURING THE PRIMARIES AND OVER 400 BLACK LEADERS, CHURCH LEADERS, SUPPORTING US. ALMOST EVERY SUNDAY I GET TO SIT IN THE PEW AND GET INSPIRED. I GO TO MASS EARLY IN THE MORNING, THEN I GO TO THE BLACK CHURCH TO GET SOME HOPE AND INVIGORATION. I TALKED TO PEOPLE AND HEAR WHAT IS ON THEIR MINDS, PRAY WITH THEM, AND GUESS WHAT? IT WAS RENEWING. IT WAS NOT ABOUT ME, BUT OUR ENTIRE FAMILY. JILL WOULD BE WITH ME AND MY GRANDKIDS, ONE OF MY GRANDKIDS IS WITH ME TODAY, A SENIOR IN COLLEGE. I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, IT HAS BEEN UNLIKE ANY CAMPAIGN IN HISTORY. THERE IS ONE THING THAT REMAINS THE SAME. WE HAVE TO EARN OUR DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. AS MY LATE FRIEND JOHN LEWIS REMINDED US, FREEDOM IS NOT A STATE. FREEDOM IS AN ACT. WE HAVE TO DEFEND IT, WE HAVE TO VOTE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIMES. WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT. WE HAVE TO VOTE LIKE WE NEVER DID BEFORE. EVERY DAY IS A NEW REMINDER OF HOW HIGH THE STAKES ARE. OF HOW FAR THE OTHER SIDE WILL GO TO TRY TO SUPPRESS THE TURNOUT, ESPECIALLY HERE IN PHILADELPHIA. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TERRIFIED OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN PENNSYLVANIA. HE KNOWS THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA GET TO HAVE THEIR SAY, IF YOU HAVE YOUR SAY, HE DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE. [HONKING] BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. 90 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED. [HORNS HONKING] THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH. THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH. THERE IS TOO MUCH ON THE LINE TO SIT IT OUT. WE HAVE TWO MORE DAYS. TWO MORE DAYS. WE CAN PUT AN END TO THIS PRESIDENCY THAT HAS, SINCE THE BEGINNING, SOUGHT TO DIVIDE US, TO TEAR US APART. FOLKS, IN TWO DAYS, WE CAN PUT AN END TO A PRESIDENT THAT HAS FAILED TO PROTECT THIS NATION. IN TWO DAYS, WE CAN PUT AN END TO A PRESIDENCY THAT HAS FANNED THE FLAMES OF HATE, POURED GASOLINE ON EVERY OPPORTUNITY HE HAD ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY VOTED. MILLIONS MORE WILL VOTE IN THE TWO DAYS AHEAD. THERE IS STILL A LOT OF PENNSYLVANIANS WHO HAVE NOT VOTED YET. WE NEED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU TO GET OUT AND VOTE ON TUESDAY. MY MESSAGE IS SIMPLE. PENNSYLVANIA IS CRITICAL IN THIS ELECTION. [HORNS HONKING] I LIVE IN DELAWARE, BUT I WAS BORN IN SCRANTON. [HORNS HONKING] I AM A PENNSYLVANIA BOY. [HORNS HONKING] I WANT TO TELL YOU, THE LAST TIME DONALD TRUMP RAN, HE WON THIS STATE BY 44,000 VOTES. SO EVERY SINGLE VOTE MATTERS. THE POWER THE POWER TO CHANGE , THIS COUNTRY IS IN YOUR HANDS. I DON'T CARE HOW HARD DONALD TRUMP TRIES. THERE IS NOTHING HE IS GOING TO DO TO STOP THIS NATION FROM VOTING, NO MATTER WHAT HE TRIES. [HORNS HONKING] AND FOLKS, WHEN AMERICANS VOTE, AMERICA WILL BE HEARD. WHEN AMERICA IS HEARD, I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE IS GOING TO BE LOUD AND CLEAR. IT IS TIME FOR DONALD TRUMP TO PACK HIS BAGS AND GO HOME. [HORNS HONKING] FMR VP BIDEN: IT IS TIME TO BREATHE SOME LIFE BACK INTO THIS NATION. WE ARE DONE, WE ARE TIRED OF THE TWEETS, THE ANGER, THE HATE, THE FAILURE, THE IRRESPONSIBILITY. [HORNS HONKING] WE HAVE A LOT WORK TO DO. IF I'M ELECTED YOUR PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO DO IT AND WE ARE GOING TO ACT AND START FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY. [HORNS HONKING] WE ARE GOING TO ACT TO GET COVID UNDER CONTROL. IT IS ALMOST CRIMINAL, THE WAY HE HAS HANDLED IT. ON DAY ONE OF MY PRESIDENCY, I'M GOING TO PUT IN ACTION A PLAN I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR MONTHS, MASKING, SOCIAL DISTANCING, TESTING, TRACING. A PLAN FOR FULL AND FAIR AND FREE DISTRIBUTION OF THERAPEUTICS, VACCINE, WHEN WE GET ONE. A PLAN TO ADDRESS THE DISPROPORTIONATE WAY THIS VIRUS HAS BEEN HITTING AND DEVASTATING THE BLACK COMMUNITY ACROSS AMERICA. [HORNS HONKING] FMR VP BIDEN: FOLKS, EVERY SINGLE DAY, WE ARE SEEING RACE-BASED DISPARITIES IN EVERY ASPECT OF THIS VIRUS. HIGHER INFECTION RATES, LOWER ACCESS TO TESTING, HARDER TIME QUARANTINING SAFELY, LOWER ACCESS TO QUALITY TREATMENT WHEN YOU BECOME INFECTED, AND TRAGICALLY, HIGHER MORTALITY RATES. THREE TIMES AS MANY AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE DYING AS WHITE AMERICANS. [HORNS HONKING] FMR VP BIDEN: WHEN THEY GET THE VIRUS. ONE IN 100 BLACK AMERICANS , EXCUSE ME, ONE IN 1000 BLACK AMERICANS HAVE DIED FROM COVID-19. AND IF WE DON'T CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ONE IN 500 BY THE END OF THIS PANDEMIC. [HORNS HONKING] THAT IS A MASS CASUALTY EVENT IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND IT IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY, TOTALLY UNCALLED FOR. MY PUBLIC HEALTH PLAN WILL ENSURE THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING HIT THE HARDEST BY THIS VIRUS ARE A PRIORITY, NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT. WE ARE GOING TO PLAN TO GET OUR ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK, NOT GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE, BUT BUILD BACK BETTER, [HORNS HONKING] TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS DEALT IN ON A FULL-SCALE SHARE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS AND BUILD ECONOMIC EQUALITY. WERE GOING TO ADDRESS THE BLINDERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SEEN, THEY HAVE SEEN HOW BAD THINGS ARE. TO MAKE IT EASIER TO START A BUSINESS. TO BUY YOUR FIRST HOME. TO PURSUE AND EDUCATION AFTER HIGH SCHOOL WITHOUT BEEN BURDENED WITH DEBT. TO INVEST IN HBCUS THAT DO SO MUCH TO MOLD BLACK LEADERS OF TOMORROW. I MEAN IT. [HORNS HONKING] THIS IS NOT JUST TALK. I MEAN THAT. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DELIVER RACIAL JUSTICE IN AMERICA. [HORNS HONKING] I SEE IN ALL THE PROTESTS HERE IN PHILADELPHIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY A CRY FOR JUSTICE. [HORNS HONKING] PROTESTING IS NOT BURNING AND LOOTING, AND VIOLENCE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. BUT THE NAMES OF GEORGE FLOYD, BREONNA TAYLOR, JACOB BLAKE, [HORNS HONKING] WALTER WALLACE JUNIOR, THEY WILL NOT SOON BE FOR COTTON. [HORNS HONKING] THEY WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN BY ME, NOT BE FORGOTTEN BY YOU, AND THEY WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BECAUSE THEY ARE INSPIRING A NEW WAVE OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA. GEORGE FLOYD'S LITTLE GIRL, SIX YEARS OLD SAID TO ME WHEN I WANT TO BE WITH THE FAMILY. I KNELT DOWN AND SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SHE SAID, \"DADDY IS GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD.\" THAT IS WHAT SHE SAID TO ME. SIX YEARS OLD. DADDY. [HORNS HONKING] LOOK, WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD. WE CAN CHANGE IT. WE ALL KNOW THIS COUNTRY HAS TO COME TOGETHER. WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF ANGER, HATE, AND DIVISION WE HAVE SEEN UNDER THIS PRESIDENT. [HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, LOOK. FROM THE DAY HE ANNOUNCED, THE MOMENT A CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR, WHAT DID HE SAY? IN NEW YORK, HE SAID, WE ARE GOING TO GO OUT AND GET THOSE RAPIST MEXICANS. RAPIST MEXICANS. HE PUT A BAN ON ALL MUSLIMS COMING TO THE UNITED STATES. AND THE WAY HE TALKED ABOUT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, THE WAY HE TALKED ABOUT THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. LOOK, FOLKS WE HAVE TO COME , TOGETHER. I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT FOR EVERYBODY. [HORNS HONKING] I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T SUPPORT ME AS THOSE WHO DO SUPPORT ME. I MEAN IT. [HORNS HONKING] THAT IS THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT. THE DUTY TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. [HORNS HONKING] IN PRESIDENT BIDEN'S AMERICA, THERE WILL BE NO RED STATES OR BLUE STATES. THERE WILL ONLY BE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [HORNS HONKING] LOOK, OUR FAITH IN OUR COUNTRY IS BEING TESTED. BUT OUR FAITH IN GOD IS HELPING US THROUGH BECAUSE OF ALL OF YOU. [HORNS HONKING] THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE GREATEST COMMANDMENT, LOVE OUR NEIGHBORS AS OURSELVES. [HORNS HONKING] AND OUR DEDICATION TO NEVER GROW WEARY OF DOING GOOD. BEING WITH YOU ALL REMINDS ME OF THAT GOSPEL HYMN THAT INSPIRED SO MANY OF US. WHEN I LAST TALKED TO JOHN LEWIS WHEN HE WAS DYING, HE REMINDED ME OF IT. I DON'T FEEL NO WAYS TIRED. [HORNS HONKING] I'VE COME TOO FAR FROM WHERE I STARTED FROM. [HORNS HONKING] NOBODY TOLD ME THE ROAD WOULD BE EASY. [HORNS HONKING] I DON'T BELIEVE HE BROUGHT ME THIS FAR TO LEAVE ME. [HORNS HONKING] HE DID NOT LEAVE US. [HORNS HONKING] WE ARE NOT TIRED. [HORNS HONKING] THE ROAD HAS NOT BEEN EASY. [HORNS HONKING] BUT WE HAVE COME TOO FAR TO STOP NOW. SO, PLEASE, VOTE.

{"SpeechID":"CSPANJB2112020146","POTUS":"Joe Biden","Date":"2020-11-02","SpeechTitle":"Joe Biden Drive-In Campaign Rally in Pittsburgh","RawText":"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. A special thanks. The local and state elected officials who were here I want to thank them a lot And I also thank your police department. I tell you what they gotta one heck of a motorcycle of escort. You know, it's great seeing Franco again. I live in the other side of the state just below that town called Philadelphia, and I get in trouble because I talk about how much I like Pittsburgh and how much I like the Steelers. Now, let me tell you why Franco and I were just in Latrobe together last month, and Franco and his teammate a guy named Rocky Bleier back in the day when my the Rooneys were really wonderful to me and my family. Because just a month after I was elected the United States Senate, I was 29 years old. December 18th It was a week before Christmas. I got a phone call when I was hiring staff in Washington, saying a tractor trailer broadsided my wife and my three Children Christmas shopping and kill my wife and killed my wife and I killed my daughter. My two boys were very badly injured. That's why I hustled homos quick as I could, and I stayed with him in that hospital room because they were really in tough shape. But on the 23rd I believe it Waas. I decided that I was gonna go out to K Mart and get a plastic Christmas tree. You know, those kinds of have on display because you weren't allowed to have any Christmas paraphernalia in the hospital that could catch fire, but I could get one of those. So I went out and I was only gone. The only time I was gone, I was gone for about, I guess, an hour, hour and a half When I came back on both my boys for the first time, there were little guys, three and four years old, almost four and five. They had smiles on their face, and each of them were holding a football signed by the entire still curtain. Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh team. And I said, What happened, boys? And they were the first time. They smiled, and they said Rocky Bleier and Franco Harris came because guess what happened. The Rooneys really fine, fine people. The Rooneys decided that they were going to send Rocky and Franco to see my boys. No publicity. They didn't do any press. Didn't anybody know? They spent 45 minutes of my boys. They got on the plane in one home. That's who we are as a country. That's something the president doesn't understand. Looking out for each other, 1000 acts of kindness, decency that people used to show to one another and still do that He just doesn't get. Pittsburgh Pittsburgh There's one more day, one more day to show who we are. Once again. Tomorrow we can end the presidency that has divided this nation. Folks at home would know. Tomorrow we could put an end to a presidency that failed to protect the nation. Tomorrow we could put an end to a presidency that has fanned the flames of hate across this nation, pouring gasoline on every racial incident in the country. Millions of Americans have already voted over almost 100 million. Now millions more will vote tomorrow. My message is simple. The power to change this country is in your hands, and I don't care how hard Donald Trump tries. There's nothing nothing he could do to stop the people of this nation from voting, no matter how he tries. There's a press article last week and a read as follows. Never before in modern presidential history has a candidate been so reliant on wide scale efforts to repress the vote as Trump something. Watch over. You don't want Americans voting. He thinks only wealthy folks should vote. You want America votes so America will be heard when America's heard. The message is going to be out loud and clear. It's time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. Go home. Look, we're done with the chaos. We're done with the racism. We're done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure of their responsibility. But we got a lot of work to do. Folks, if I'm elected president, we're gonna act on day one, we're gonna act to get Cove it under control. On Day one of my presidency, I'll put knocks in a plan. But I've been talking about for months masking social distancing, testing. Tracy Ah, plan for full and fair and free distribution of therapeutics and vaccines when we get one. And most importantly, we hadn't done yet a plan, a plan that addresses the fact that we can get everybody access to the vaccine when it comes. Folks, there's over 300 million people in America. Everyone, everyone going to get help. The plan to address the disproportionate way the virus is heading the black community and minority communities. We're seeing race based disparities all across every aspect of this virus. Higher infection rates. Lower access to testing. Ah, harder time quarantine, safe quarantine and safely lower access to quality treatment when you become infected and tragically higher Mortality rates three times as high as the white population. One in 1000 black Americans have died from covert so far. By the end of this pandemic, if things continue as he's allowing them dio until the next president takes office, there will be another 200,000 deaths projected. And that will mean one in 500 African Americans will have died because of Cove in. That is absolutely outrageous. That is an attack, a mass casualties for black Americans. This president he knew in January how bad this virus was in January. He knew it. Some of you may remember vaguely have turned on the television time. I wouldn't in office, but I was talking about the fact that he got intelligence briefings laying out how dangerous it was coming from China and where it was happening. And he said no. He didn't read his intelligence uh, briefing in the morning. Well, that didn't surprise May. It doesn't read, but turns out he knew exactly how dangerous it Waas. Remember what he said to Bob Woodward, the famous journalist? He went on tape and he said to Woodward, he knew in January how dangerous it waas and how many people could die and he said nothing. He didn't say a thing to you, me or anybody else. He kept it secret. He hit it from the American people. He knew his worse than the flu. He lied to the American people. He knew it wasn't going to disappear. He kept telling us a miracle was coming. Or maybe we should inject bleach into our veins. I mean, whatever. God, what, anyway? And just Friday, this past Friday here, the goal. To suggest that the American doctors and nurses who are literally risking their lives to save lives on the front line of this crisis for nine months that he suggested that these folks know what they said they're doing, he said. Doctors air falsely inflating the death. Do Thio coverted because they wanna make mawr money. Now think about that President of the United States of America. But then again, it doesn't surprise me. He wouldn't do anything unless he could make more money, not a joke. Everything to him is about How do you help yourself, folks? Look, people of this nation have suffered sacrifice for nine months, none more so than our doctors and our frontline healthcare workers as the president questioning their character and their integrity, their commitment to his fellow Americans, the president questioning that it's a flat disgrace. And then last night, Trump said, he's gonna fire Dr Fauci. I got a better idea. Let's fire Trump and I'll hire Dr Fauci. Look, the president has waved the white flag of surrender in this virus. I'll never do that, his chief of staff said last week. We're not going to control this virus. We're not going to control the virus. The first step, the beating, the virus is defeating Donald Trump. Look, folks, if you know if we didn't know this was happening and I somebody made a movie about this five years ago, you think it was all crazy, but it's really it's really what's happening. Donald Trump, by the way, keeps telling us what a great jobs president has been how many jobs created? Well, I was just with President Obama in Detroit and Flint, Michigan, my buddy. It was great to be with the president. Real character, a president respected around the world a president kids could look up to. But did you know President Obama? I helped create more jobs in the last three years of our administration than Trump did in the first three years of his. Even before the pandemic, it did. You know, Donald Trump is going to be the first president in 90 years who's going to finish with is four years in office with fewer jobs under his leadership than when he started his president? And black unemployment remains too high. Too many black businesses shuttered for good black don't business or shutting down twice as fast as other businesses and business communities of color have shuttered because they didn't get the help. The money that Congress had passed Congress passed over $2 trillion. No, the first thing when the president did, he fired the inspector general was supposed to follow the money went and guess what when already businesses, small businesses, they didn't get the help. It went to the march. A Lago crowd. Not a joke. His wealthy friends Hey, fired the Inspector general. You know he sees the world from Park Avenue. I had seen it from Skrine. I see from where I grew up. I see. From here in Pittsburgh, Wall Street didn't build this country. Working people built this country that's always has built the country's middle class. And you just built the middle class folks. I believe we should be ready. Work, not wealth in this country. You don't realize that just since the pandemic started, the listed billionaires in America made another $300 billion. What a joke. $300 billion they made in the middle of pandemic. What's going on here, folks? Well, I got a plan. None of my plan I commit to you. No one making less than 400 grand is gonna see there A penny in taxes raised. But for a change. The wealthiest and the biggest corporations, 91 of the Fortune 500 companies pay zero in taxes after making billions of dollars. Well, guess what? Under a bite administration. They're going to start paying their fair share. Why should a firefighter uneducated or a nurse. Still, worker pay a higher tax rate. And that's the God's truth. Ah, higher tax rate that is super wealthy. And by the way, why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump? I released 23 years of my tax returns. I had two dubious distinction. Being listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years. And then when I got elected, vice president said, it's probable no man has ever assumed the office vice president with fewer assets than Joe Biden. I assume they weren't speaking about intellectual assets. It could have been. But who knows? Well, look, here's my point, Trump and the only taxes that we've been able to find out through The New York Times one year he has he paid $750 in taxes. Trump keeps talking about corruption. When's the last time you heard what president having a secret bank account in China? What she did, we just found out where he played 50 times Mawr tax in China than it in the United States. Every time he starts talking about corruption, I se release your tax return. What in the hell are you hiding? What are you hiding? Not one anyway. I won't get into. Look, we're gonna have to protect health care. Trump. Republicans just jammed through a Supreme Court nomination. You know why they did? To try to destroy the Affordable care act. If they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose the protections for pre existing conditions, including more than five million people here in the United States. I mean, excuse me. Here in the state of Pennsylvania, over 100 million in the United States, millions of black Americans will be left uninsured. Denied health coverage because of pre existing conditions and their arm or pre existing conditions in poor communities than there are in others. Donald Trump thinks health care is a privilege. I think it's a right Look, I'm not only restore of Obama care, I'll build on it. You can keep your private insurance if you like it. You can choose Medicare like public option. I'm gonna increase subsidies to lower your premiums, deductibles, out of pocket expenses, out of pocket spending, surprise billing. I'm gonna lower prescription drugs by 60%. And that's the truth. But by the way, how you gonna do it, Joe? Because those wealthy people are gonna start paying their fair share. I thought of a punishing everyone. It's about being fair. We'll make sure the protections for people with preexisting conditions remain. And meanwhile, Trump said publicly said, if he's re elected, he's gonna defund Social Security payments. The extra It's so, Security Department said, if he does that, that will eliminate eliminate Medicare by 2023. After all the people rely on Medicare. It's not gonna happen, by the way, we're not gonna let it happen. But that's his plan. So go home and tell your grandparent's and parent's. We'll protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which he won't do. And finally, both deliver some. We need to vote now deliver some racial justice in America. Look, A season of protest has broken out all across this nation. Protest. It is not burning and looting and violence that can't be tolerated. A won't But those protests our cry for justice. The name of George Floyd, Briana Tailor, Jacob Blake, Walter Wallace Jr. They're not going to soon be forgot. Not gonna be forgotten by me, not by us, not by this country. They'll inspire a whole new wave of justice in America when I met with when I met with Floyd's family, has a little daughter survived him. She's six years old and I knelt down. I talked to I said I started to talk to her. No, she said. He looked at me, said Mr Vice President, Daddy, change, going to change the world. Daddy is going to change the world, Folks, The country is ready. The country is ready. But not with Donald. Trump is president now. He wants us to believe so much. He's done for black Americans. You might have seen the debate ahead of them. I was standing next to Abraham Lincoln, he said. Not since Abraham Lincoln has anyone done as much for the African American communities. I have. I turned him and ask him a. He got offended. You got offended. Look, Pittsburgh honk if you think his commitment of having Dunmore for the African American community and Abraham Lincoln is true, honk your horn Silence. You got it, man. Pittsburgh honk if you think it's a bunch of malarkey, Why you got it? Look, the truth is, Donald Thas done Maura Harm Black America and then the president in modern history. This is the same man who started the birther movement against my buddy. Barack. Obama is the first man. That's the man who in the first black woman running for vice president, he looks at her. He calls her a monster. Oh, yeah, man. Remember on stage with them when I ask about the proud boys, that racist group of white supremacists, he said, I said, Would you deny them? He turned and he said, I'm gonna tell him toe stand down and stand by When in God's name did you ever expect American president say who refused? It announced. White supremacy Doesn't believe systemic racism is a problem. I won't even say black lives matter. Black lives matter what I work to deliver real police and criminal reform. Justice reform. We know, we know. But true justice is all about. It's not only about system criminal justice system, that's fair, but it's about being able to build wealth, jobs, homes, families, folks. We're in a situation where think about it, how many people you know, working two jobs and still being in poverty? We need a national minimum wage of $15 an hour for everybody, period hog. If you agree with May honking. You agree with me? My proposal for first time home buyer. First time Homebuyers. I promise you are going to get a $15 down payment for the first home, huh? Yeah. For new capital start businesses because block entrepreneurs are equally successful. Is any other entrepreneurs? But they can't get access. That's why Barack and I started a program to give $1.5 billion a local small business associations toe lend money that brought 30 billion off the sideline. Want change that to $15 billion and we're gonna bring 150 off the sideline. Look, in addition to that, think about this Education. Education is the key. The movement. Well, guess what? They're gonna be free college education for state universities When I am your president, I got triple funding by the way we could afford this. I promise you, I'm gonna triple funding for Title one schools so a child could get a good public education no matter what their zip code is allowing, every three and four or five year olds would goto school, not daycare. That increases by 58% of prospects. That child will go all the way through 12 years. And, hawk, if you agree with me, I'm gonna invest $70 billion in HBC. Use a minority serving institutions for really DeGette institutions. So future generations of black students can continue to get the very best education folks. Pennsylvania in 2000 and eight in 2000 and 12. You placed your trust in Barack and me Now in 2020. I'm asking for your trust again in May. And Kamala, by the way, she is one smart, bright, tough woman. Man, I'm so proud. She said Yes. Look, I'm running is a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. That's the job of a president, the duty to represent everyone. Everyone and you two have a duty. If you haven't already voted to vote tomorrow, make a plan. Get out the vote Goto. I will vote com slash p a and ask yourself if Donald Trump is so proud of his record, especially for African Americans, why does he make it so hard for us to vote? And then remember the final words my good friend and American hero John Lewis, who recently died, he said the vote is the most powerful, nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it because they're not guaranteed. You'll lose folks. Please, please. Here's the amazing thing. Here's the amazing thing, folks. It's about this moment in history. On the one hand, we're facing the biggest threat about who we are, what we believe we've seen in our lifetimes. But on the other hand, our future has never been more promising. I said it many times. I'm more optimistic about America's future today than it was when I got elected as a 29 year old kid and I mean it. Here's why or better position than any nation in the world toe lead the 21st century, our workers or three times as productive workers, the biggest economies in the world. We have the strongest military in history of the world. We have the most innovative entrepreneurs, were virtually energy independent, and we have mawr research universities out of virtue. Every major change comes then the entire rest of the world combined. Northern Asian can match us. We lead by the power of our example, not just the example of our power. We're laughing stock around the world right now. The only thing that could tear America apart as America itself. And that's exactly what Donald Trump has been doing beginning this campaign. He knows the only way he can win his divide. America finished against one another based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion. That's wrong. It's not who we are. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let's show them who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lies. It's time to stand up and take back this democracy. We could do this. We're better than we've been. We could be our best. What were the United States of America? God bless you all And may God protect our troops.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?477699-1\/joe-biden-drive-campaign-rally-pittsburgh","Summary":"2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden spoke at a drive-in rally focused on encouraging Black voters to make it to the polls.","Source":"477699-1","Type":"Speech"}

No one fights harder, but the dignity of working people and share does shared won re election in 18 about the same margin the trump did. And, uh So when sheriff tells me to come to Ohio the day before I come to Ohio, that's what I do because he and I have something common. We married way up. He married a Pulitzer Prize winner. I'm married a professor on. I'll tell you what, Connie, you've been wonderful. Connie actually reviewed my wife's book. I found out any rate on a thank you for being here, folks, Ohio, One more day, one more day tomorrow. Tomorrow we have an opportunity to put an end to a presidency that's divided this nation. Tomorrow we can put an end to a president, has failed to protect this nation. And tomorrow we could put an end to a president has fanned the flames of hate All across this country, millions of Americans have already voted. Almost 100 million have voted so far. Ah, 100 million voted already. I'm or gonna vote today on my message is simple. The power to change the country is in your hands. I don't care how much Donald Trump tries. There's nothing Nothing he's going to do to stop the people in this nation from voting folks. He hadn't figured it out. President, Don't determine who gets to vote. Voters determined who is going to be the President of American Votes. America will be heard when America is heard. I believe the message is going to be loud and clear. It's time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. We're done. We're done with the chaos. We're done with the tweets. The anger, the hate, the failure, the irresponsibility. We've got a whole lot of work to do. If I am elected your president, I'm gonna act. I'm gonna act on Day one, folks. We're gonna act to get this under control. On Day one of my presidency, we're gonna put in action. Ah, plan that I've been talking about for months and he's been paying no attention to masking social distinct testing. Tracy. Ah, plan for a fair and full on free distribution of therapeutics and vaccines. When we get one. Imagine. Imagine where we bay had this president from the beginning just wore a mask instead of mocked wearing a mask. I can tell you this. We wouldn't have nine million confirmed covert cases in this nation. Wouldn't have over 230,000 deaths. It wouldn't be seeing those new record numbers of cases we're seeing every single day right now. Nearly 100,000 cases and one day just two days ago, 100,000 new cases. We wouldn't be facing another 200,000 projected deaths in the next few months. This president new Last January, the virus was deadly, but he hit it from the American people he knew was worse than the flu. He lied to the American people. You knew it wasn't going to disappear. But he kept telling us a miracle was coming. And just Friday he had the goal. Think of this now the President, United States of America, who is responsible for so many deaths here. The goal. To suggest an American doctors, the people who have been on the front lines of this crisis for nine months, along with nurses and so many others, many of whom have died to suggest the doctors are falsely inflating deaths due to Kobe because they want to make mawr money. I'm serious, man. This guy's a disgrace. People of this nation have suffered. They've sacrificed for nine months, not more than those doctors and nurses, those health care workers. And this president is questioning their character, their integrity, their commitment to their fellow Americans. So I said, it's a disgrace. And last night Trump said he was going to fire Dr Fauci. Isn't that wonderful? I got a better idea. Elect me and I'm gonna hire Dr Fauci. Not and we're gonna fire Donald Trump. Donald Trump waved the white flag of surrender to this virus. He did that. His own chief of staff said last week. We're giving up on the virus. We're not gonna do anything about it. I'm never going to raise the white flag of surrender. We're gonna beat this virus. We're going to get it under control. I promise you. Look, the first step to beating the virus is beating Donald Trump. Donald Trump keeps telling us what a great jobs president he is. I was just with Barack and Detroit and Flint. It was great to be with the president's, um, character President respected around the world, President our kids couldn't did look up to. But did you know that after President Obama and I bet on American workers and helped rescue the auto industry. Nearly 500,000 jobs created here in Ohio. Meanwhile, 330,000 of those have been lost since Trump's become president. You know, Donald Trump is going to be the first president in 90 years. That's a lot of presidents in 90 years was going to finish his four years in office with fewer jobs. Then when he got elected to office, it's no surprise. Remember what the lies he told all the workers, he told the families of the GM plant in Lordstown. He said, Quote, Don't move, Don't tell your house. But then the plant shut down. After the first debate in Cleveland, I met in Ohio, woman named Tiffany, whose husband lost her job at the plant, and he had to take a job eight hours away. In another state, he drives home weekends, 16 hours round trip to be home with his kids. So much for Don't worry. What about his threat and his grudge against Goodyear? What about his broken promise to protect pensions for workers, especially model employer and pensions? What about? He stopped the overtime for millions of American workers over a billion $200 million for American workers. The president. I was helping your delegation put in place. Let's not forget how Donald Trump is weakened, chaotic with China on trade, foreign bankruptcies, away up, exports your way down. Agricultural exports to China during the trump years have been 40% lower than they were doing. We were in our second term and even even says, because of his bail outs of the farmers that your tax dollars, by the way, the Baylor his bail out of the farmers quote. Our farmers are doing better now, then when they actually had a farm. Can you believe that our farmers are doing better now that we actually had a farm because they were able to be bailed out? Although they may not have a farm anymore? Who does this guy think he is? My policy is gonna hold China accountable. I'll end the Trump tax loopholes, then incentivize companies that ship jobs overseas. I'll add a 10% surtax on companies who do ship jobs overseas. But for companies who bring and come back and invest in American manufacturing and bring jobs back home, I'll offer 10% tax credit and folks, it's no violation. Any trade agreement but no government contracts. And the president has about $600 billion in contracts from the military on down, no government contract We've given to a company that isn't have all the products, including the supply line, all products made in America, every product. Look on our future we made right here, right here in Ohio. Folks, we're in a position that we could do so much mawr. So much more folks. Donald for Donald Trump forgot and betrayed Ohio workers. Quite frankly, I grew up with guys like around guys like Donald Trump. I grew up in neighborhoods like probably many of you did working class neighborhoods were most people didn't have a college education. But we had guys like Trump we used to play against when we played ball in Scranton and Claymont, and I kinda because they had more money than we did kind of look down their nose on us. I gotta admit to you, I got a bit of a chip on my shoulder when I read about, I read. Once we won the nomination and things began to look a little better. I read from serious press people. They're decent, honorable people that If I get elected, I'll be the first president who didn't have an Ivy League degree in a long time. Well, let me tell you something somehow that's come in. I didn't belong because I went to a state university. But let me tell you what it's about. Time I got from the State University graduated into the White House. Because if I'm there, you're gonna be there, too. Look, Trump sees the world from Park Avenue looking down on Wall Street. I see from Scranton and Claymont where I grew up. I see it from here in Cleveland. Wall Street didn't build America the middle class Bill America. And guess what? Unions built the middle class. I think it's long past time we start rewarding work, not wealth in this country. Under my plan, if you make less than $400,000 you won't pay a single penny more in taxes. You have my word on it. But I tell you what. The wealthiest among us big corporations, 91 of which don't pay any tax that paid zero federal income tax they're going to start paying their fair share. Why literature? Why should a firefighter uneducated a cop. Why should a welder why should have still worker pay the higher tax rate, then the super wealthy? It's not right. Why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump? For God's sake, look, I released 22 years of my tax return. They can look him up online. Donald Tdidn't release any wonder what tell he's hiding. I wonder why he won't let anybody know what his tax returns are. Who's your the money to this? The guy, by the way, he found out recently, has a secret bank account in China, paid 50 times more tax in Beijing. Then he did in the United States, and, overall, the one income tax The New York Times got he paid $750 in federal taxes. How about you? And when he was asked how we could pay so little, remember what he said? He said, Because I'm smart, don't know how to game the system. And that's the kind of guy who wants president that can game the system be a billionaire on page 750 bucks in taxes Are you all Break your necks, break your necks, pay a fair share. We're going to act to protect healthcare. By the way, Trump and Republican just jam through a new Supreme Court nomination for one basic reason. Within a week after the election, they're gonna be before the Supreme Court in this new nominee is gonna be on the court. It's all about destroying the Affordable care act, getting rid of it completely. They've been trying to do it now for nine years. If they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose protections for pre existing conditions, including nearly five million folks here in Ohio. Look, Donald care Donald Trump don't understand health care. He thinks it's the privilege. I think health care is a right, by the way, because of his, the way ruined the economy. Even before the pandemic, 10 million Americans have already lost their employer based health care because the employer has gone out of business. Now he wants to go after the 22 million who have health care only because the affordable care act I'm not only restore the afore affordable care act, I'll build on it to keep you can keep your private insurance, or you can choose the Medicare like public option in the new plan, I'm gonna increase subsidies and lower premiums and deductibles out of pocket expenses and surprise billings. We're gonna reduce drug costs by 60% by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices for all of us. Folks, folks, it's going to cost more money, But guess I'm gonna pay for it. Trump's gonna start paying some taxes. We're gonna make sure we keep protections for people with pre existing conditions. Meanwhile, the Social Security, actually that personal runs The Social Security Department says if Donald Trump's plan that he announced, if he's reelected, he's gonna put in place if in fact, is put in place, it would bankrupt Social Security by 2023. This guy really cares a lot about his, doesn't he? He really understands. Been busted on that. My parents before of May and everyone else paying into Social Security. So go home and tell your parents and grand parents what a great deal they're gonna get if Trump gets re elected. But, folks, the fact is, I'm gonna protect your Social Security. I guarantee it because I got people behind me. You're gonna make sure it's protected. We're gonna protect Social Security, and we're gonna have a situation. Well, guess what. We have a majority in the United States Senate folks. Look, the thing is bothered me most. Maybe emotionally bothered me the most, but substantively as well that this president has done. There's been nothing worse than the way he has spoken about those who've served in uniforms. You called y'all losers and suckers. My son Beau was the attorney general, the state of Delaware. My son Beau volunteered. He had to give up the seat of attorney general, volunteered to go to Iraq for a year. He won the Bronze Star, the key speakers service medal, and he saw that people die in Iraq. He was not a loser. He was not a sucker. He was a patriot, just like all your sons and daughters, parents and grand parents who serve folks. Six generals who worked in the White House with the president, United States and admirals worked in the administration have since left, and they've said he is unfit to be commander in chief. Best of my knowledge, share it. That's never happened before for any president United States. And that's why Special Operations Commander standing McChrystal as well as the Commander, Special Ops and the Navy SEALS who took out bin Laden along Bill McRaven Admiral Craven, along with 2 22 other four stars. They have endorsed me, saying they'd be proud to have me is their commander in chief. This president likes to portray himself as a tough guy. The macho man. When's the last time you saw the president, United States, literally being laughed at by the world leaders when he spoke to the United Nations? I don't ever recall that ever happened. Can you believe when the president, United States, acts like Vladimir Putin's puppy? Putin put bounties on the heads of American soldiers in Afghanistan. Tspoke to him six times. There's too frightened to challenge him. Why Donald Trump's not strong. He's weak. This is a president who not only doesn't understand sacrifice, he doesn't understand courage, physical courage. It takes for so many of you to put on that uniform. We must support our military. Let's make this vote for them as well. God love them. Look, we have to meet. We have to vote to meet the challenges of the climate crisis. Well, we can act to meet that climate crisis. Trump calls climate crisis the hoax. I see it as a great opportunity to improve our health as well as create millions of good paying jobs. I see America's working to build and install 500 0 charging stations all across this country. American consumers switching to clean electric vehicle. We can own the electric vehicle market, creating millions of jobs here in Cleveland and in Ohio and in Detroit. Folks, I see the federal government harnessing the persons of power by buying these electric vehicles made in America made in Ohio, made in Detroit, Made in America, it's going to mean one million, according to experts. One million new good pain, auto jobs in the automobile industry alone. Folks, if we don't act, China is gonna own the market. China is gonna own it all and we will act. In addition, deliver racial justice in America, folks. Pro testing is not burning and looting. Violence not must never be tolerated. It won't. But these protests are cry for justice. The names of George floored Rianna Taylor Jacob break Blake will soon not be forgot. You know, I met with all these families Well, I met with with Floyd's little girl I think she was six years old. I knelt down to say or to be a high level with her. She looked at me and she said, I swear to God said Mr Vice President, my daddy, it's going to change in the world. My dad is gonna change the world. Folks, I'm not gonna forget. You're not gonna get this Country is not gonna forget this is going to inspire a new wave of justice in America. But guess what? Because we have the X Generation E Z generation that in fact is the most open least prejudice. Best educated generation, American history. They're already moving. They're already insisted on justice. They know who we are, A new wave of justice, American. But also true. Justice isn't just about how they deal with police. It's about jobs. It's about building wealth. It's about families. It's about education. It's about opportunity. It's about being able to make a decent living. Nobody should have to work two jobs instead of property. That's why honk if you agree with me that a $15 minimum wage is just necessary Nationwide. Hawk Hawk, can you think assistance for a down payment for a really shot of home ownership should be coming forward with me with $15 for first time homeowners to start a small business, send the child to college debt free folks Ohio in 2000 and 2012 you place your trust in me and Barack in 2020. I'm asking you to trust me again. I'm proud of the coalition. This campaign is built. Welcome. Democrats, Republicans and independents. I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'll govern as an American president. There will be no red states and blue states, Just the United States. Yeah, and I promise you, I'll work us hard for those who don't support me is those who dio that's the job of a president to care to care about everybody, everybody. That's the duty of a president. Look, look. You too have a duty a duty to vote, folks, make a plan, Goto I will vote dot com slash o h folks, amazing thing about this moment in our history. On the one hand, we're facing the biggest threat of who we are. What we believe. What we've seen. What we've been in our lifetimes. Another hand. Our future has never been more promising. I've said it many times. The character of America is literally on the ballot, the character of our country. But I'm more optimistic about America's future today. Then, when I was elected, two United States senators, a 29 year old kid, let me tell you why we are better position than any nation in the world to lead the 21st century. Our workers were three times as productive as other work. We have the biggest economy in the world. We have the strongest military in the history of the world. We have the most innovative entrepreneurs in the world, and we are virtually energy independent. We have more great research universities in America than all the rest of the world combined, out of which all these new inventions of GERD No, the nation could matches. We lead by the example of our power, not just by the power by the power of our example. The only thing we could could tear America apart is America itself. And that's exactly what Donald Trump has tried to do from the beginning of his campaign. Divide America. The only way you can win separators pit Americans against one another based on race, gender, ethnicity, national origin. It's wrong. It's not who we are. But it's his only prospect. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let's keep showing them who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lives. Thanks. It's time to stand up. It's time to take back our democracy. We can do this for so much better than this. We could be our best. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the United States of America. There's not a damn thing. We can't do nothing. So let's get up and do it. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you.

HE STARTED THIS MORNING WITH CAMPAIGN VOLUNTEERS IN THE NORTHWEST SUBURBS OF PITTSBURGH. (music) THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THE ONE THING I HAVE KNOWN MY WHOLE CAREER, THANK GOD FOR UNIONS. FOLKS, GOOD TO BE BACK IN BEAVER COUNTY. THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION. I DO APPRECIATE IT. ONE OTHER THING ABOUT THE IRONWORKERS IS THAT I THINK YOU ARE ALL CRAZY. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I REMEMBER IRONWORKERS ENDORSED ME EARLY ON WHEN I RAN FOR THE SENATE AS A KID. I GUY NAMED TOMMY SCHRANK, I USED TO WALK IN ALL THE TIME AND SAY ANYBODY CRAZY ENOUGH TO WALK UP 16 STORIES ON A BEEMER HAS TO BE NUTS. BUT THANK GOD YOU ARE. WHERE I GREW UP, YOU JOINED THE TRADES, BECAME A COP, FIREFIGHTER, OR PRIEST. I WASN'T COMPETENT ENOUGH TO BE ANYONE OF THEM, SO LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. CONNOR, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW, THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST AN ELECTION THIS TIMEOUT. THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT, AN AWFUL LOT AT STAKE. OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO SEND CONNOR BACK. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I'M USED TO BABIES. ANYONE IS ALLOWED TO CRY IF THEY WANT. TO MAKE NOISE, TOO. SO LOOK, I WANTED TO COMBINE , COME BY AND SAY THANK YOU, PERSONALLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. THE MAYOR IS HERE, THEY TELL ME. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MAYOR IS. MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU, PAL. BEING MAYOR IS A REAL JOB. THEY KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE. TERRY, ROB, I WANT TO THANK YOU. EVERYONE ACROSS BEAVER COUNTY. FOLKS, LOOK, THE FACT IS THAT FROM THE BEGINNING OF MY CAREER I HAVE FOUND MYSELF IN A SITUATION I HAVE RELIED ON, LABOR. I HOPE I DEMONSTRATED THAT LABOR CAN RELY ON ME. YOU KNOW, WE ARE IN THE HOME STRETCH, NOW. WE ARE IN THE HOME STRETCH. AS MY COACH USED TO SAY IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE, IT'S GO TIME, IT'S GO TIME. TOMORROW IS THE DAY. TOMORROW WE SEND CONNOR BACK TO CONGRESS AND WE WILL HEAR WHAT LABOR HAD TO SAY. WE WILL WIN PENNSYLVANIA. AND WE ARE GOING TO SHOW THE WORLD WHAT AMERICA STANDS FOR. FOLKS, AS I SAID, I WANTED TO COME BY AND THANK YOU PERSONALLY . THANK THE MAYOR AND EVERYONE ELSE I JUST MENTIONED. THE FACT IS, THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. WE ARE AT ONE OF THOSE REAL INFLECTION POINTS. IT'S MORE THAN JUST TWO GOVERNS THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. WHAT HAPPENS NOW, WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW DETERMINES WHAT THIS COUNTRY LOOKS LIKE FOR A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS. THAT'S NOT A JOKE. I GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT. THERE IS SO DAMN MUCH AT STAKE. IN THIS HOME STRETCH, YOU FIND YOURSELF GOING HOME. I FIND MYSELF GOING HOME. THIS IS LIKE HOME. I'M FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. GREW UP IN CLAREMONT, DELAWARE. USED TO BE A STEEL TOWN WITH STEELWORKERS. USED TO HAVE 5800 STEELWORKERS. ALL GONE. ALL GONE, NOW. GOT TO GET IT BACK. NOT GOING TO GET IT BACK IN CLAYMONT, BUT WE WILL GET IT BACK IN THE UNITED STATES. AS I SAID, WE ARE HEADING TO A HOME STRETCH. WE KNOW THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. IF HE LOST A JOB SCRANTON, WHEN THE COLD DIED, HE TOOK US HOME TO MY GRAND POPS HOUSE. HE MADE WHAT I CALL THE LONGEST WALK ON MOM OR DAD HAS TO MAKE. UP A SHORT FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO A KIDS BEDROOM TO SAY HONEY, I'M SORRY. YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO THAT SCHOOL , CAN'T PLAY IN THAT LITTLE LEAGUE CLUB ANYMORE. DAD LOST HIS JOB, WE HAVE TO MOVE. CAN'T STAY WHERE WE ARE. TOOK US HOME TO MY GRAND POPS HOUSE. WHAT HAPPENED WAS HE SAID I'M TAKING US DOWN TO DELAWARE, THERE'S JOBS DOWN THERE. I'LL COME HOME EVERY WEEKEND AND IT WILL TAKE ME TIME UNTIL I CAN GET EVERYONE DOWN. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. FROM THAT POINT ON, WHEN DAD WOULD TALK ABOUT A JOB, HE WOULD SAY A JOB INVOLVES MORE THAN A PAYCHECK. IT'S ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT RESPECT. IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT'S ABOUT LOOKING YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAYING HONEY, IT'S GOING TO BE OK. NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THESE DAYS. TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE WORRIED. I NEVER FORGOT, GROWING UP IN A HARD-WORKING FAMILY IN SCRANTON, THESE ARE LESSONS DONALD TRUMP HAS NEVER LEARNED. HE CAN ONLY SEE THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE HE CAN'T LET FAMILIES LIKE YOURS AND MINE HAVE GONE THROUGH. HE REFUSES TO DO THE WORK TO GET THE VIRUS UNDER CONTROL. REFUSES TO DO THE WORK TO GET THE SCHOOLS AND SMALL BUSINESS SOURCE , BUSINESS IS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO STAY OPEN. THEY USED TO BRING CONGRESS TOGETHER. HE REFUSED TO BRING THEM TOGETHER TO PROVIDE FOR THE WORKING FAMILY. HE THINKS WALL STREET THIS COUNTRY. I GOT NEWS FOR HIM. YOU ALREADY KNOW IT. WALL STREET DIDN'T BUILD AMERICA. THE MIDDLE-CLASS DID. UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE-CLASS. THAT'S A FACT. THAT'S A NATURAL FACT. LOOK, I SEE THIS WORLD FROM SCRANTON. FROM WORKING-CLASS TOWNS AROUND THE STATE. THAT IS WHY THE BILL BACK BETTER PLAN, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME WE ARE GOING TO START REWARDING WORK. WE AREN'T GOING TO RAISE TAX ON ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. MAKE MORE THAN THAT? GUESS WHAT, YOU'RE GOING TO START PAYING YOUR FAIR SHARE AND STEPPING UP. I HAVE ASKED OF THE BIG CORPORATIONS AND THE WEALTHY TO STEP UP. FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES, 90 OF THEM DIDN'T PAY A PENNY IN TAXES. THEY ARE TRYING TO RAILROAD YOU GUYS. WE ARE GOING TO COLLECT MONEY, GOING TO THE WORKING PEOPLE, TO CREATE GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. BRIDGES, WATER SYSTEMS, WHOLE LOT MORE BEING DONE BY CERTIFIED LABOR. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES TRUMPED TRIES TO LIE ABOUT IT, I WON'T BAN FRACKING, NEVER SAID I WOULD. BUT I AM GOING TO AND TRUMP SENDING JOBS OVERSEAS. WE HAVE A TRADE STRATEGY RIGHT NOW WHERE YOU GET 10% CUT IN YOUR TAX IF YOU SEND A JOB OVERSEAS. WE ARE GOING TO REVERSE IT. BRING A JOB HOME, GET 10%. I'M GOING TO PROMISE YOU ONE THING, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT HAS CONTROL OF 600 BILLION DOLLARS, HANDING OUT CONTRACTS AND CONSTRUCTION FOR EVERYTHING FROM AIRCRAFT CARRIERS TO PUBLIC HOUSING. HERE'S THE PROMISE I MADE TO YOU. NOT ONE SINGLE CONTRACT WILL BE LET TO A CONTRACTOR THAT DOESN'T HAVE PRODUCTS THAT ARE ALL MADE IN AMERICA. THAT'S A GUARANTEE, EVERYONE. WE ARE ALLOWED TO DO THAT NOW, BUT WE HAVE NEVER DONE IT. IT'S ABOUT TIME WE STEPPED UP TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE , BY THE WAY, ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION, DONALD TRUMP TALKS ABOUT HIMSELF AS A TOUGH GUY. I GREW UP WITH HIM , GUYS LIKE HIM AROUND AND SCRANTON. THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD LOOK DOWN THEIR NOSE AT US BECAUSE THEY HAD MORE MONEY. THAT BECAUSE THEY CAME FROM WELL-KNOWN FAMILIES THEY WERE SOMEHOW BETTER. WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. HE TALKS ABOUT HOW TOUGH HE IS, HARD-WORKING HE IS, DONE SO MUCH. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BOTHERED ME MOST IN THIS CAMPAIGN, I HAD TO TELL YOU, THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT OUR VETERANS AS BEING LOSERS. LOSERS. WHAT IS THIS GUY ALL ABOUT? WHO IS HE? HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. FOLKS, MY SON WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF DELAWARE. HE GAVE UP THE SEAT TO FIGHT IN A RACK FOR A YEAR. HE WON THE BRONZE STAR, THE SERVICE MEDAL. HE CAME HOME AND HE DIED OF CANCER. HE CAME HOME AND GUESS WHAT, HE WAS NO LOSER. TRUMP IS THE LOSER. ALL OF YOU HAVE SERVED. ALL OF YOU HAVE SERVED. I REALLY MEAN IT. THINK ABOUT IT, THINK ABOUT IT. IS IT ANY WONDER WHY? THIS IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT I'M AWARE OF, THE SIX TOP GENERALS THAT WORK FOR HIM, THE SIX FOUR-STAR ADMIRALS AND GENERALS, THEY ALL LEFT SAYING THAT HE DIDN'T, HE WASN'T WORTHY OF BEING COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. THEY QUIT. SPECIAL FORCES, THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO DID A LOT COMMANDING. THEY BOTH ENDORSED ME. AND I CAME ALONG, 22 FOUR STARS, STEPPING UP TO ENDORSE ME BECAUSE THEY KNEW I WOULD HAVE THEIR BACK. THIS GUY DOESN'T GET IT. I MEAN IT. MANY OF YOU SERVED. IT TOOK PHYSICAL COURAGE TO DO IT. HE DOESN'T GET IT. FOLKS, WE OWE THE MILITARY. 1%, 1% OF THE AMERICANS PROTECTING THE OTHER 99% OF US. WE OWE THEM BIG. LOOK, WE CAN ONLY GET THIS DONE, THOUGH, WE CAN ONLY GET THIS DONE IF PENNSYLVANIANS VOTE. WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER RETURNS THEIR BALLOT IN VOTES TOMORROW, MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE YOU KNOW DOES THE SAME. IT'S TIME TO REBUILD THE BACK OWN OF THIS COUNTRY. THE MIDDLE-CLASS. THIS TIME BRING EVERYBODY ALONG. EVERYBODY. IT'S TIME TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S THE AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY. ON THE ONE HAND FACING THE BIGGEST THREAT TO WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE BELIEVE IN OUR LIFETIME. ON THE OTHER HAND, OUR FUTURE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE PROMISING. I HAVE SAID IT MANY TIMES, I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S FUTURE TODAY THAN WHEN I GOT ELECTED AS A 29-YEAR-OLD KID TO THE SENATE. HERE'S WHY, WE ARE IN A BETTER POSITION THAN ANY NATION IN THE WORLD TO LEAD THE 21ST CENTURY. WE HAVE THE BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE MOST INNOVATIVE ENTREPRENEURS, VIRTUALLY ENERGY INDEPENDENT. WE HAVE MORE GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE WESTERN WORLD COMBINED. NO OTHER NATION CAN TOUCH US. NO OTHER NATION CAN LEAD US. WE CAN LEAD BY THE POWER OF EXAMPLE, NOT JUST THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER. THE ONLY THING THEY CAN TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA ITSELF. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. DIVIDE AMERICA, PIT AMERICANS AGAINST EACH OTHER. RURAL VERSUS URBAN, BASED ON RACE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, NATIONAL ORIGIN. THAT'S WRONG. THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WHAT ABOUT HONOR, INTEGRITY, DIGNITY. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE'VE GOT TO SHOW HIM WHO WE ARE. WE CHOOSE. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR, UNITY OVER DIVISION. SCIENCE OVER FICTION. YEAH, WE CHOOSE TRUTH OVERLIES, CONSTANT LIES , TRUTH OVER LIES, CONSTANT LIES. FOLKS, IT'S TIME TO STAND UP AND TAKE BACK THIS DEMOCRACY. WE CAN DO THIS. NOT LOSE STATES AND RED STATES, BUT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . LET'S TAKE IT BACK. I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU, LIKE MY DAD USED TO SAY, THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH POWER IS POWER. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DEAL WITH CORPORATE GREED IN AMERICA IS UNION POWER. THAT'S A FACT. THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO KEEP THE BARBARIANS ON THE OTHERS OF THE GATE, MAN. THE ONLY ONES. FOLKS, I PROMISE YOU, THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT BACK IN USE OF , ROOSEVELT STATE DIDN'T SAY THAT WE WERE ALLOWED TO HAVE UNIONS, IT SAID THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROMOTE UNIONS. I PROMISE YOU I WILL BE THE MOST PRO UNION PRESIDENT YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. I GUARANTEE YOU A SEAT AT THE TABLE. GOD LOVE YOU ALL. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. LET'S GET THIS VOTE OUT. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. (music) I WANT TO DO SOMETHING I'M VERY , V.P. BIDEN: I WANT TO DO SOMETHING I'M VERY PROUD OF. THAT'S ON I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT I LOST, I WANT HIS CHILDREN TO COME UP HERE WITH ME. DON'T BE SILLY. THIS IS NATALIE AND HUNTER. I WANT YOU TO MEET TWO OF MY OTHER FOUR CHILDREN. MAISIE, BY THE WAY, TWO TEAM ALLSTATE. ALSO, THIS IS MY OLDEST, NAOMI, NAMED AFTER MY DECEASED DAUGHTER. SHE JUST GRADUATED FROM LAW SCHOOL. ALL KIDDING ASIDE, I WANT YOU TO MEET MY GRANDCHILDREN. I'M PROUD TO HAVE THEM HERE WITH ME. I'VE BEEN BRAGGING ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA AND THEY WANTED TO COME BE WITH US. SO, THANK YOU ALL.","SpeechURL":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?477703-1\/joe-biden-remarks-canvas-kick-event-pittsburgh","Summary":"2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden spoke at a canvass kick-off event for campaign volunteers working in the suburbs northwest of Pittsburgh.

HE WILL BE IN PITTSBURGH. WE TAKE YOU NOW LIVE TO PHILADELPHIA. WE WILL HEAR SHORTLY FROM HIS VICE-PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE KAMALA HARRIS, WITH MUSICIAN JOHN LEGEND ON STAGE. THIS IS LIVE CAMPAIGN 2020 COVERAGE ON C-SPAN. IS OUR ABILITY TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, . IN THIS ELECTION, YOUR VOTE WILL DECIDE WHETHER WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT ALLOWS THIS PANDEMIC TO CONTINUE INDEFINITELY OR ONE WITH A PLAN TO END IT. A COUNTRY WHERE THE PRESIDENT WILL GO TO COURT TO KICK 20 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF THEIR HEALTH CARE, OR ONE WHERE HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT FOR ALL AMERICANS. A COUNTRY WHERE THE PRESIDENT ACTIVELY ENCOURAGES POLICE BRUTALITY AND CANNOT BRING HIMSELF TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS OR NEO NAZIS, OR ONE WHERE WE HOLD OUR POLICE ACCOUNTABLE AND BEGIN TO ROOT OUT THE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN OUR SOCIETY. A COUNTRY THAT IS SMALL, MEAN, SELFISH, AND DIVIDED, OR A COUNTRY THAT IS BIG, GENEROUS, KIND AND DECENT. A COUNTRY WHERE WE REMEMBER THAT WHILE WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT POLITICS AND DIFFERENT BELIEFS, WE ARE ALL AMERICANS. THAT'S WHY I ALREADY VOTED FOR JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. [CHEERS] JOE BIDEN WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T TAKE PLEASURE IN DIVIDING US, BUT ONE WHO WORKS HARD TO BRING US TOGETHER IN COMMON CAUSE IN COMMON EFFORT. A PRESIDENT GUIDED NOT BY WISHFUL THINKING BUT BY A BELIEF IN SCIENCE AND A COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE. SOME PEOPLE SEE THE MEANNESS, THE BULLYING, THE SELFISHNESS OF DONALD TRUMP, AND A MISTAKE IT FOR STRENGTH. IT KIND OF TWISTED MASCULINITY. SOME SEE HIS GREED AND A MISTAKE IT FOR BEING GOOD AT BUSINESS. SOME OF YOUR FORMER FAVORITE RAPPERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN BY THESE LIES. [APPLAUSE] I THINK THEY EVEN FOUNDED IN YOU SUPERGROUP, IT IS CALLED \"THE SUNKEN PLACE.\" BUT TRUMP'S PLATINUM PLAN FOR BLACK FOLKS IS NOTHING BUT FULL'SFOOLS'S GOLD. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BANK ON THE WORD HE SAID. ASK THE STUDENTS OF TRUMP UNIVERSITY. ASK ALL THE CONTRACTORS HE STIFFED. ASK THE PEOPLE HIS CHARITY WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP BEFORE IT WAS SHUT DOWN FOR BEING A FRAUD. ASK ALL THE BLACK AND BROWN AMERICANS WHO ARE DYING FROM THIS VIRUS AND LOSING THEIR JOBS UNDER HIS WATCH. THE PRESIDENT ISN'T STRONG. HE IS A COWARD. AND HIS CAREER IN BUSINESS AND IN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FAILURE AFTER FAILURE AFTER FAILURE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WE CAN TRUST. THAT IS THE KIND OF PRESIDENT JOE WILL BE. HE WILL NOT ONLY REVERSE THE DAMAGE OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAND-IN-HAND WITH SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS, THEY WILL BUILD BACK A BETTER ECONOMY AND COUNTRY THAN EVER BEFORE. BUT JOE CANNOT DO THIS ALONE. HE NEEDS YOUR HELP. AND TOMORROW HE NEEDS YOUR VOTE. GO OUT TO I WILL. WILLVOTE.COM RIGHT NOW TO FIGURE OUT YOUR POLLING PLACE AND FIGURE OUT WHEN AND HOW YOU ARE CASTING YOUR BALLOT IF YOU HAVEN'T. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY VOTED, MAKE SURE YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE A PLAN TO DO THE SAME THING. REMEMBER, YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS IN PENNSYLVANIA, YOU CAN VOTE IN PERSON TOMORROW BETWEEN 7 A.M. AND 8 P.M., OR YOU CAN DELIVER YOUR MAIL-IN BALLOT IN PERSON, IN PERSON , DON'T PUT IT IN THE MAIL , IN PERSON TO ONE OF THE DROP BOXES OR ELECTION OFFICES LOCATED IN YOUR COUNTY BY TOMORROW AT 8 P.M. AND MAKE SURE YOU READ AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. PUT THE BALLOT IN THE SMALL ENVELOPE. DON'T BE CAUGHT OUT THERE NAKED. THEN PUT THE WHOLE THING IN THE BIG ENVELOPE INSIDE IT.

DON'T LET THEM TAKE AWAY YOUR VOTE, DON'T LET THEM TAKE AWAY YOUR VOICE. PHILADELPHIA, WE HAVE A POWER TO PUT AN END TO THIS NIGHTMARE.

I AM NOT JUST A BARBER, I AM A GOD-FEARING MAN WHO LOVES MY FAMILY, AND I LOVE TO BE IN BUSINESS HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHY TODAY IS IMPORTANT TO ME. WHEN I LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. THEY SAY THIS ELECTION IS A BATTLE OF THE SOUL OF THE NATION. WHEN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TOMORROW TO PUT MORE SO IN OUR NATION, THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME. MY WIFE AND I HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TRAINING OF OUR CHILDREN AND WERE THEY SHOULD GO. BUT THAT CAN'T BE DONE ALONE, BECAUSE IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A FAMILY. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT YOU GUYS TO KNOW IS THAT WHEN MY DAUGHTER HAD A CHANCE TO WATCH KAMALA HARRIS AT A VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, SHE BECAME AN ADDITIONAL ROLE MODEL FOR MY DAUGHTER. LET ME TELL YOU WHY. SHE HANDLED THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WITH GRACE. IF THERE IS ANYBODY THAT I WANT MY DAUGHTER QUOTING, I WANT MY DAUGHTER QUOTING KEMAL AND NOT CARDI. EXCUSE ME, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, I'M TALKING. WHEN I LOOK AT , [INAUDIBLE] , BUT YOUR CHILDREN TO DREAM BIGGER, TO WALK TALLER, BECAUSE OF HAVING INSPIRATIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN OFFICE. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONNECTED. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HEART, WHO UNDERSTAND THE STRUGGLES THAT WE ALL GO THROUGH AS CITIZENS WITHIN PENNSYLVANIA, AS CITIZENS WITHIN AMERICA. WHEN I LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ELECTED OFFICIALS IN OFFICE, BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT, WE ARE LOOKING AT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT IS ON THE BALLOT. I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. I WANT EVERYBODY TO THINK ABOUT , THE GOVERNMENT IS JUST LIKE ANY SPORTS TEAM. WE CANNOT JUST HAVE OUR STAR PLAYERS. WE NEED THEM. WE NEED JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE EVERY OTHER ROLE PLAYER THAT IS ELECTED BY US TO BE A PART OF THAT WINNING TEAM. SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO FORGET, WE DO NEED OUR STARS. BUT IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR THE REST OF THE TEAM THAT IS NEEDED FOR US TO WIN. [CARS HONKING] [APPLAUSE] PENNSYLVANIA, WE ARE A FIRST-CLASS STATE. WE ARE FIRST-CLASS CITIZENS. I NEED US TO SHOW UP TOMORROW IN DROVES AND SHOW THE REST OF AMERICA HOW WE CAN BLOW TRUMP OUT OF THE WATER WITH A BLOWOUT! [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] IT AIN'T GOING TO BE CLOSE! [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO BE LEADERS IN THIS BLOWOUT. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] I WANT EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. WE ARE PUTTING IN LEADERS IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO ARE CONNECTED SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ALLIES IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE CAN HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PLANS TO SUPPORT BLACK AND BROWN BUSINESSES IN OFFICE. WE WILL HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PLANS TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH CARE IN OFFICE. INDIVIDUALS IN OFFICE THAT HAVE PLANS TO SUPPORT HBCUS. [APPLAUSE] WHAT I NEED FROM ALL OF US IS TO GET OUT TO VOTE. I NEED FROM ALL OF US TO TELL OTHERS TO GET OUT THE VOTE. I NEED ALL OF US TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE WE KNOW IS CHARGED UP WITH THE RIGHT INFORMATION AND MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS TO PUT THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN OFFICE SO THAT WE CAN TRULY WIN. [CARS HONKING] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE BEEN GIVEN A PRIVILEGED TO INTRODUCE , I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE OUR NEW VICE PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CAN EVERYONE GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR OUR NEW VICE PRESIDENT, KAMALA HARRIS? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [MARY J. BLIGE'S [\"WORK THAT\" PLAYS] (music) (music) GIRL, LIVE YOUR LIFE DON'T SWEAT, GIRL, BE YOURSELF FOLLOW ME, FOLLOW ME, FOLLOW ME WORK YOUR THING OUT (LET 'EM GET MAD, THEY GONNA HATE ANYWAY) WORK YOUR THING OUT YEAH YEAH, WORK WHAT YOU GOT I'M TALKING 'BOUT THINGS THAT I KNOW (music) (music) HELLO, PENNSYLVANIA! ARE YOU READY? [APPLAUSE] JOE IS HERE! YOU ARE HERE! WE ARE HERE! [APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE HERE TO BRING THIS ELECTION HOME. BUT WE'VE GOT ONE MORE DAY. THAT IS IT. ONE MORE DAY. JOE AND I ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR PRAYERS, YOUR LOVE, YOUR COURAGE , VOLUNTEERING AND MAKING CALLS. FOR YOUR TRUST IN US. AND FOR YOUR VOTE. AND AS WE HEAD INTO TOMORROW, AS WE HEAD INTO TOMORROW, I KNOW WE ARE EMPOWERED. WE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR FUTURE. WE KNOW THE STRENGTH OF UNITY. WE KNOW THE STRENGTH OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, WENZHOU ASKED ME TO JOIN THIS TICKET , WHEN JOE ASKED ME TO JOIN THIS TICKET, SAYING YES WAS EASY. HE AND I DON'T COME FROM THE SAME BACKGROUNDS, BUT WE WERE RAISED WITH THE SAME VALUES , HARD WORK, HONESTY, DECENCY, A BELIEF THAT WE ALL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER. THOSE ARE THE VALUES I HAVE SEEN WHEN I HAVE TRAVELED ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST 84 DAYS. THE VALUES WE SHARE AS AMERICANS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. YOU CAN FEEL. YOU CAN FEEL THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL TOWN, WEARING MASKS AND SOCIALLY DISTANCING. I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE LINING THE STREETS AND GATHERING ON CORNERS TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT. THEY ARE BRINGING THEIR CHILDREN. HOLDING UP SIGNS. WEARING THEIR COLORS AND STROLLING TO THE POLLS! [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] AND WAVING THE RED WHITE AND BLUE! [APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] THE ENERGY OUT THERE IS REAL. AND IT IS INSPIRING. IN THIS BATTLE FOR THE VERY SOUL OF OUR NATION, WE HAVE SEEN WHAT CAN BE UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. WE HAVE SEEN WHO WE ARE. AND A WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. AND THAT IS WHY I KNOW THAT TOMORROW, WE ARE GOING TO ELECT JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] HONK IF YOU HAVE VOTED. ]AND IF YOU HAVE NOT, FIND OUT WHEN AND WHERE YOU WILL GO TOMORROW. THERE IS STILL ALMOST 20 FOUR HOURS WE HAVE GOT TO GET THIS DONE. HONK IF YOU HAVE BEEN SENDING TEXT AND MAKING CALLS TO GET OUT THE VOTE. [CARS HONKING] BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW FROM THE TIME THE POLLS OPEN TOMORROW MORNING UNTIL THEY CLOSE, EVERY MINUTE COUNTS. WE CANNOT LET UP BECAUSE IT AIN'T OVER TILL IT'S OVER. AND EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. OUR HEALTH, OUR ECONOMY, OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE. A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT TREATS ALL PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AND EQUALLY UNDER THE LAW. A SUPREME COURT THAT IT ADVANCES THE LEGACY OF JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG. THAT LIVES UP, LIVES UP TO THE PHRASE ABOVE ITS ENTRANCE, EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO BE. THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE. IT IS ALL ON THE LINE. THIS IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME. THE DECISION WE MAKE WILL WITHOUT QUESTION LAST FOR GENERATIONS. AS I TRAVEL AROUND, ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES ON EVERYONE'S MIND IS THE PANDEMIC. THAT IS RAVAGING OUR COUNTRY. REMEMBER, BACK IN JANUARY, DONALD TRUMP NEW JUST HOW BAD THE CORONAVIRUS WAS. THAT IT WAS DEADLY AND AIRBORNE. BUT WHAT DID HE DO WITH THAT INFORMATION? HE LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERAS AT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND LIED ABOUT IT. HE COVERED IT UP. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD KNOWN ON JANUARY 28 WHAT HE KNEW? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE, WHAT YOUR FAMILY MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE? CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW BUSINESSES, SCHOOLS, MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREPARE? HOW WE AS A COUNTRY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREPARE? BUT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT THINK ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR AMERICA. HE ONLY THINKS ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR HIMSELF. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE LOST 230,000 LIVES TO COVID. SO MANY PEOPLE FORCED TO DIE ALONE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS VIRUS. 230,000 AMERICANS. THE LAST TIME WE EXPERIENCED LOSS LIKE THIS WAS WORLD WAR II. IN ADDITION, WE ARE LOOKING AT OVER 9 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS AND WE KNOW IT IS HITTING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE HARDEST. LATINOS ARE CONTRACTING COVID AT THREE TIMES THE RATE OF OTHERS. LET'S BE CLEAR. WE ARE ALSO IN THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS WE HAVE FACED SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. SINCE DONALD TRUMP FAILED TO CONTAIN THIS VIRUS, HE FAILED TO LEAD. 23 MILLION PEOPLE ARE SEEING UNEMPLOYMENT. ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS WITH A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 12 IS DESCRIBING HER CHILDREN AS BEING HUNGRY. IN AMERICA. IN ONE IN SIX HOUSEHOLDS, FOLKS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR RENT AND CONCERNED THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY. AND YET NINE MONTHS INTO THIS PANDEMIC, THIS PRESIDENT STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN TO CONTAIN IT. WE HAVE WITNESSED THE GREATEST FAILURE OF A PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION IN AMERICA'S HISTORY. [CARS HONKING] ON TOP OF IT ALL, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN COURT TRYING TO END THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND TAKE HEALTH COVERAGE AWAY FROM OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS. HE'S TRYING TO END PROTECTIONS FOR THE OVER 100 MILLION AMERICANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA, DIABETES , HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, OR CANCER. HONK IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY, RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WITH DIABETES. MORE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, OR ASTHMA, OR CANCER. AMERICA, WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. THE FIRST THING JOE AND I WILL DO WHEN WE ARE IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS GET THIS VIRUS UNDER CONTROL. [CARS HONKING] WE WILL LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. WE WILL PROVIDE FREE TESTING AND TREATMENT AND, WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE, A SAFE VACCINE FOR ALL. WE WILL PROVIDE SCHOOLS WITH THE GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BE OPEN SAFELY AND WE WILL BILL BACK AN ECONOMY THAT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE. AND LET ME BE CLEAR. JOE AND I WILL NOT INCREASE TAXES ON ANYONE MAKING UNDER $400,000 A YEAR. PERIOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] BUT WE WILL ASK THE SUPER WEALTHY AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. AND WE WILL INVEST THOSE TAX DOLLARS TO REBUILD OUR NATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE, TO TACKLE THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. MAKE CHILDCARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND INVEST IN OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS. WE WILL BUILD ON OBAMACARE AND EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, INCLUDING EXPANDING MENTAL HEALTH CARE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE BODY DOES NOT START FROM THE NECK DOWN. IT INCLUDES THE NECK UP AND IT DESERVES THE HEALTH CARE THAT ALL PEOPLE NEED. WE WILL LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND PROTECT AND EXPAND MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY. WE WILL WORK TO ROOT OUT THE SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT STILL EXISTS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WE WILL CONFRONT, NOT CONDONE, WHITE SUPREMACY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] AND PENNSYLVANIA, WE WILL BEGIN THE WORK OF HEALING AND REPAIRING AND UNITING OUR NATION. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS, PEOPLE OF ALL RACES AND ALL BACKGROUNDS. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IS HOW WE HAVE ALWAYS OVERCOME OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES. TOGETHER. JOE GETS THAT. JOE UNDERSTANDS THAT. YOU SEE, JOE IS A LEADER WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. HE SEES US AND HE UNDERSTANDS SUFFERING BECAUSE HE HAS EXPERIENCED SO MUCH OF IT HIMSELF. JOE BIDEN IS A LEADER OF STRENGTH AND EMPATHY. TOUGHNESS AND HUMILITY. HE UNDERSTANDS THE MEASURE OF A PERSON'S STRENGTH IS NOT WHO YOU PUT DOWN, IT IS WHO YOU LIFT UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] HE KNOWS NO MATTER WHERE WE COME FROM OR WHERE WE LIVE, RACE, GENDER, BACKGROUND OR FAITH, NO MATTER HOW WE IDENTIFY OR WHO WE LOVE, NO MATTER THE LANGUAGE A GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS, WHAT WE HAVE IN COMMON IS SO MUCH STRONGER THAN WHAT DIVIDES US. [CARS HONKING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REMEMBER THIS. YOUR VOTE IS YOUR VOICE AND YOUR VOICE IS YOUR POWER. AND DO NOT LET ANYONE TAKE YOUR POWER FROM YOU. NOW IS THE TIME TO STAND UP. NOW IS THE TIME TO SPEAK OUT. NOW IS THE TIME TO VOTE AND VOTE LIKE OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT BECAUSE THEY DO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] OUR DEMOCRACY IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE AS STRONG AS OUR WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR IT. IN THIS ELECTION, LET'S ABOUT LIKE OUR DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON IT, VOTE LIKE JUSTICE, EQUALITY, AND OPPORTUNITY, CHARACTER, AND DIGNITY ARE ON THE BALLOT, BECAUSE THEY ARE. AND ONE DAY, ONE DAY, OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS WILL LOOK US IN THE EYE, EACH ONE OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHAT DID YOU DO AT THAT MOMENT? I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY, WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD TO FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY AND THEIR FUTURE. SO LET'S DO THAT. LET'S VOTE, BUT WITH CONVICTION AND CONFIDENCE AND HOPE, AND LET US ELECT JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

I AM A FOURTH GENERATION UNION STRONG HERE IN PITTSBURGH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] I HAVE BEEN A PROUD MEMBER AT 1050 84 11 YEARS. FOUR YEARS AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA HE WOULD CREATE JOBS. TODAY THERE ARE 200,000 FEWER JOBS IN THIS STATE THAN WHEN BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN LEFT OFFICE. HE CAMPAIGNED IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA IN 2016 PROMISING A MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. INFRASTRUCTURE MADE WITH AMERICAN STEEL IN PITTSBURGH. HE NEVER EVEN REALLY TRIED TO DELIVER. INSTEAD HE SPENT HIS TIME GIVING TAX BREAKS TO WALL STREET AND THE SUPER WEALTHY WHILE UNDERMINING UNIONS AND LEAVING WORKING FAMILIES BEHIND. FROM THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE WORLD, HE HAS FANNED THE FLAMES OF RACIAL TENSION, PUTTING THE LIVES OF 70 PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME IN DANGER , SO MANY PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME IN DANGER. WE CANNOT STAND FOR A PRESIDENT WHO THINKS IT IS FINE TO KEEP WORKERS DOWN SO LONG AS THE NUMBERS ON THE STOCK MARKET GO UP. WE CANNOT KEEP WAITING TO HEAR WHAT HE WILL SAY NEXT TO DEEPEN THE RACIAL DIVISION IN THIS COUNTRY. WE NEED TO STAND UP AND ELECT THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO SHARES THE VALUES OF WORKING PEOPLE AND WILL EMPOWER US TO SUCCEED. THAT IS JOE BIDEN. JOE UNDERSTANDS THE STRUGGLES THAT WORKING COMMUNITY SPACE BECAUSE JOE IS ONE OF US. HE IS FROM PENNSYLVANIA. SCRANTON IS NOT FAR AWAY. THE VALUES JOE LEARNED IN SCRANTON, HARD WORK, EMPATHY, ARE THE SAME VALUES HE HAS CARRIED THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE AS A PUBLIC SERVANT. THERE , THEY ARE THE SAME VALUES HE IS GOING TO TAKE TO THE WHITE HOUSE. AS PRESIDENT JOE IS GOING TO HELP COMMUNITIES RECOVER FROM THE CORONAVIRUS AND THEN BUT WORKING PEOPLE IN WESTERN PA AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AT THE CENTER OF EFFORTS TO BUILD BACK A BETTER ECONOMY. [CARS HONKING] HE'S GOING TO CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND HE WILL ENCOURAGE UNIONIZATION AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT WORKERS IN UNIONS, NOT WALL STREET, BUILT THIS COUNTRY. [CARS HONKING] JOE IS GOING TO WORK TO ENSURE THAT ALL PEOPLE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE, WHO THEY LOVE WHAT THEY DO FOR LIVING ARE TREATED WITH THE EQUAL AMOUNT OF DIGNITY AND RESPECT. WE ARE A MATTER OF HOURS AWAY FROM THE END OF THE SELECTION AND THE WORK WE DO TOMORROW WILL DETERMINE WHETHER WE PUT A CHAMPION FOR THE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE IN OFFICE OR CONTINUE TO BE PUSHED AROUND BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. TO ME, THE CHOICE IS EASY. TOMORROW, LET'S GET A PLAN, LET'S GO OUT AND LET'S VOTE, AND LET'S VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN. HELP ME IN WELCOMING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] (music) HELLO, PITTSBURGH! I'M JOE BIDEN. LADY GAGA'S FRIEND. WE GO BACK A WHILE. SHE HAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME HELPING ME WITH THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND SO MANY WOMEN WHO NEEDED HELP , GOD LOVE YOU, YOU ARE WONDERFUL. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. FOLKS, JOHN, THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY, AND THANKS TO MR. MAYOR , I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE, BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, THANKS FOR THE PASSPORT INTO TOWN. AND THANKS FOR ALL THE SPEAKERS WE HEARD TONIGHT AS WELL AS THE INCREDIBLE, AS I SAID, LADY GAGA. YOU COULDN'T SEE BUT ALL OF MY GRANDKIDS WERE OVER THERE AND WIN YOU WERE SINGING, THEY KNEW EVERY WORD OF EVERY SONG, THEY WERE JUMPING AND MOVING. I'VE GOT TO GET A PICTURE WITH THEM. ANYWAY. MY BUDDY, CONGRESSMAN MARK DOYLE , THANK YOU FOR STANDING WITH ME AND FIGHTING FOR THE DIGNITY OF WORKING PEOPLE. EVERYONE YOU HAVE HEARD FROM ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL AS IN PHILADELPHIA, WE HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEARLY. CONGRESSMAN BOYLE HAS BEEN WITH ME A WHILE, A REMARKABLE FRIEND. HIS DAD AND I GREW UP FIVE BLOCKS AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER IN SCRANTON. BOB CASEY, PATTI LABELLE AND JOHN LEGEND. JOHN, I'M VOTING FOR YOU AFTER THAT SPEECH. LOOK, DOUG, I LOVE YOU. YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. I WANT TO THANK THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, A WOMAN I AM SO PROUD TO RUN ALONGSIDE, KAMALA HARRIS. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] LOOK, I KNOW AS A SCRANTON BOY, AND FROM CLAYMONT, DELAWARE, I KNOW IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO BRING WESTERN AND EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA TOGETHER, YOU KNOW WHAT, THE STEELERS GOT A BIG WIN YESTERDAY AND THE EAGLES GOT A BIG WIN LAST NIGHT. THEY CAN BOTH BE HAPPY. [LAUGHS] AND FOLKS, I HAVE A FEELING WE ARE COMING TOGETHER FOR A BIG WIN TOMORROW. [RAUCOUS CHEERING] MY LORD, THERE ARE A LOT OF YOU OUT HERE ON THIS COLD NIGHT. THANK YOU. DON'T JUMP, I NEED YOU. FOLKS, LOOK , 18 MONTHS AGO WE KICKED OFF THE CAMPAIGN AT THE LOCAL 249 RIGHT HERE IN PITTSBURGH. I CHOSE WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA FOR MY FIRST START AS A CANDIDATE AND NOW AS MY LAST STOP BEFORE ELECTION DAY BECAUSE YOU REPRESENT THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. HARD-WORKING FAMILIES ASKING FOR NOTHING BUT A FAIR SHOT, AND EVEN CHANCE, ORDINARY PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. THE QUALITIES THAT BUILT THIS COUNTRY, THAT CREATED AND SUSTAINED THE MIDDLE CLASS. BY THE WAY, AS I SAID, UNIONS BILL TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE WE ANNOUNCED. AMERICA HAS FACED A CONFLUENCE OF CRISES UNLIKE ANYTHING IN LIVING MEMORY. WE ARE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. DECENCY, HONOR AND RESPECT. THEY ARE GONE WITH THIS PRESIDENT. TOMORROW IS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW DAY! TOMORROW WE CAN PUT AN END TO A PRESIDENCY THAT HAS LEFT HARD-WORKING AMERICANS IN THE COLD. TOMORROW WE CAN PUT AN END TO A PRESIDENT WHO HAS DIVIDED THIS NATION AND FANNED THE FLAMES OF HATE. TOMORROW WE CAN PUT AN END TO A PRESIDENCY WHO HAS FAILED TO PROTECT THIS NATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY VOTED, CLOSE TO 100 MILLION, AND MORE WILL VOTE TOMORROW. MY MESSAGE IS SIMPLE , THE POWER TO CHANGE THIS COUNTRY IS IN YOUR HANDS, IN YOUR HANDS! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] I DON'T CARE HOW HARD DONALD TRUMP TRIES, THERE IS NOTHING, NOTHING THAT WILL STOP THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION FROM VOTING, PERIOD. AND WHEN AMERICA VOTES, AMERICA WILL BE HEARD! AND WHEN AMERICA IS HEARD, I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE WILL BE LOUD AND CLEAR , IT IS TIME FOR DONALD TRUMP TO PACK HIS BAGS AND GO HOME! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] I HONEST TO GOD BELIEVE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY , THE CHAOS, THE CORRUPTION, THE FAILURE, THE IRRESPONSIBILITY, THE INDIFFERENCE TO AMERICAN LIVES, THE INDIFFERENCE TO AMERICAN DIGNITY. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. NOT THE VISION AND DISTRACTION, BUT REAL, REAL, REAL HEALING FOR THIS COUNTRY. IF YOU ELECT ME AS PRESIDENT, I WILL HEAL THIS COUNTRY AND WE WILL ACT, WE WILL ACT TO GET COVID UNDER CONTROL BEGINNING DAY ONE. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] I WILL PUT AN ACTION PLAN I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR MONTHS, TESTING, TRACING, A PLAN FOR A PLAN FOR FULL AND FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF THERAPEUTICS AND A VACCINE WHEN IT COMES. IMAGINE, IMAGINE WHERE WE COULD BE IF THE PRESIDENT HAD ONLY WORE A MASK IN THE BEGINNING INSTEAD OF MOCKING THEM. I CAN TELL YOU THIS, AS EVERY EXPERT WILL TELL YOU, WE WOULD NOT HAVE 9 BILLION COVID CASES IN THIS NATION, OVER 230,000 DEATHS, NEARLY 100,000 CASES NATIONWIDE SINCE TWO DAYS AGO, WOULD NOT BE FACING ANOTHER 200,000 DEATHS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS , THAT IS WHAT EXPERTS ARE TELLING US. IF WE DON'T CHANGE, 200,000 MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THIS PRESIDENT KNEW IN JANUARY THAT THIS VIRUS WAS DEADLY, BUT HE HIT IT FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE KNEW IT WAS WORTH THE FLU , WORSE THAN THE FLU BUT HE LIED TO US. HE KNEW IT WAS NOT GOING TO DISAPPEAR, HE KEPT TELLING US IT WOULD BE OVER BY EASTER. LAST FRIDAY HE HAD THE GALL TO SUGGEST THAT AMERICA'S DOCTORS, ON THE FRONTLINE LINE OF THE CRISIS, FOR NINE MONTHS, ALONG WITH NURSES AND FIRST RESPONDERS, HE SUGGESTED THE DOCTORS WERE FALSELY INFLATING THE DEATHS DUE TO COVID BECAUSE THEY WANTED MORE MONEY. FOR GOD'S SAKE. I REALLY MEAN IT, THINK ABOUT IT. OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS, THEY HAVE SUFFERED AND SACRIFICED FOR NINE WORDS , NINE MONTHS IN THIS QUESTION IS QUESTIONING THEIR CHARACTER, INTEGRITY, COMMITMENT TO THEIR FELLOW AMERICANS? IT IS A DISGRACE! LAST NIGHT, TRUMP WENT ON TO SAY HE WAS GOING TO FIRE DR. FAUCI. I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA, LET'S FIRE TRUMP AND I WILL HIRE FAUCI! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] THINK ABOUT IT. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP HAS WAIVED WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER. HE SAID I AM THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND I WILL FIGHT THIS FIGHT , WITH ME A BREAK. , GIVE ME A BREAK. HE WAVED THE WHITE FLAG OF CEMENT OR , OF SURRENDER. I WILL NEVER SURRENDER. THE FIRST STEP TO BEATING THE VIRUS IS BEATING DONALD TRUMP. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING , DONALD TRUMP KEEPS TELLING US WHAT A GREAT JOB HE'S DONE AS PRESIDENT. AS I SAY, BLESS ME FATHER AS I , [LAUGHTER] HERE IS THE TRUTH, DONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN 90 YEARS , THAT IS A LOT OF PRESIDENTS , THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN 90 YEARS TO FINISH HIS TERM IN OFFICE WITH FEWER JOBS THAN WHEN HE STARTED. AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS, NOT FROM A LIBERAL THINK TANK, BUT MOODY'S, WALL STREET FIRM, PROJECTS MY PLAN WILL CREATE 7 MILLION MORE JOBS AND A TRILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF ECONOMIC GROUP , GROWTH MORE THAN ANYTHING THE PRESIDENT HAS PROPOSED. SO WE CAN DO THIS. I AM GOING TO END TRUMPS TAX LOOPHOLES TO INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES TO SHIFT JOBS OVERSEAS. THAT'S WHY THERE'S NOT AS MANY JOBS HERE. I'M GOING TO AT A 10% SURTAX ON ANY COMPANY THAT SHIPS JOBS OVERSEAS. COMPANIES THAT INVEST IN AMERICAN MANUFACTURING, BRING JOBS BACK, WILL GET THAT 10% TAX CREDIT. BY THE WAY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ABOUT $600 MILLION OF CONTRACTS A YEAR, FROM BUILDING AIRCRAFT CARRIERS TO ALL THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS. I PROMISE YOU THIS, IT VIOLATES NO TRADE AGREEMENT, THERE WILL BE NO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS GIVEN OUT ON MY WATCH THAT DON'T MAKE ALL OF THE PRODUCTS HERE IN AMERICA. THE FUTURE WILL BE MADE RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA, IN PENNSYLVANIA. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, TRUMP SEES THE WORLD FROM PARK AVENUE. FROM WALL STREET. THAT'S ALL HE CAN SEE. I SEE IT FROM SCRANTON, WHERE I GREW UP. I SEE IT FROM PENNSYLVANIA AND DELAWARE. WALL STREET DID NOT BUILD THIS COUNTRY, WORKING PEOPLE BUILT THIS COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS BUILT THE COUNTRY, AND UNIONS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. HE SAID JOE, THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE OF POWER IS WITH POWER. THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE OF POWER IN CORPORATE AMERICA IS UNION POWER! THAT'S THE ONLY WAY HE CAN BE DEALT WITH. IF I AM ELECTED, YOU WILL SEE THE MOST PROUNION PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY SITTING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. LOOK , I BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE ABOUT REWARDING WORK, NOT WEALTH. UNDER MY PLAN, AS KAMALA SAID, IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN $400,000, YOU WILL NOT PAY A PENNY MORE IN TAXES. FINALLY, FINALLY, THE WEALTHIEST AMONG US, THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS, 91 OF WHICH ON THE FORTUNE 500 PAY ZERO IN INCOME TAX, YOU WILL PAY YOUR FAIR SHARE. WHY? WHY SHOULD AN IRONWORKER, AN EDUCATOR, A NURSE PAY A HIGHER TAX RATE THAN THE SUPER WEALTHY? FOLKS , HERE IS A GOOD ONE , WHY SHOULD YOU BE PAYING MORE THAN DONALD TRUMP PAYS IN TAXES? [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] HE PAID $750 IN TAXES ONE YEAR. WHEN THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT IT A LITTLE BEFORE THAT, HE SAID THE REASON HE ALWAYS PAID THAT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS SMART AND HE KNEW HOW TO GAME THE SYSTEM. I AM SICK OF THE WEALTHY GUYS GAMING THE SYSTEM! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] MOST ARE WILLING TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE, BUT LET ME TELL YOU, BY THE WAY, HE LOVES TO TALK ABOUT CORRUPTION. [LAUGHS] OH MY LORD. HE LOVES TO TALK ABOUT CORRUPTION. WE FOUND OUT LAST WEEK HE IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT I'VE EVER HEARD OF WHO HAS A SECRET BANK ACCOUNT IN CHINA, WHERE HE PAID 50 TIMES MORE TAXES IN BEIJING THAN HE DID IN THE UNITED STATES. FOLKS, AS MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE SAID, I ENOUGH IS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. LOOK, WE HAVE TO PROTECT HEALTH CARE AS WELL. TRUMP HAS BEEN TRYING LIKE THE DEVIL TO ELIMINATE THE HEALTH CARE PLAN. BY THE WAY, BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC POLICIES AND SO MANY COMPANIES GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, WE ALREADY HAVE 10 MILLION AMERICANS WHO HAVE ALREADY LOST HEALTH CARE. NOW TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS JAMMED THROUGH A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE FOR ONE OVERWHELMING REASON , THEY WANT TO DESTROY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IF THEY GET THEIR WAY , BY THE WAY, THIS IS NOT MY PROBLEM , BY THE WAY, THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, SEVEN DAYS AFTER TOMORROW THEY WILL BE IN THE SUPREME COURT ARGUING TO WIPE OUT ALL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HURTING. I CAN REMEMBER AS A KID GROWING UP IN CLAYMONT AND WILMINGTON, SPLIT-LEVEL HOME WITH THREE KIDS AND A GRANDFATHER. ONE NIGHT I COULD HEAR MY DAD IN THE NEXT ROOM TALKING TO MY MOM. I ASKED ABOUT IT THE NEXT MORNING AND SHE SAID YOUR DAD JUST LOST HER HEALTH INSURANCE. HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW ARE STARING AT THE CEILING WONDERING WHAT IN GOD'S NAME THEY ARE GOING TO DO WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE? HOW MANY OF THEM? HOW MANY OF THEM ARE WORRIED LIKE WE WERE WHEN OUR SON CAME HOME DYING? I WONDER WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE IF HE WOULD'VE HAD TO SUFFER THE LAST MONTHS IN THE HOSPITAL WITHOUT INSURANCE. HOW MANY OF YOU WORRY ABOUT IT? WORRY ABOUT YOUR KIDS, WORRY ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING? IF THEY GET THEIR WAY, 100 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING 5 MILLION PENNSYLVANIANS. IT IS WRONG! IT IS WRONG! DONALD TRUMP , LOOK, FOLKS. CONSUMER HEALTH CARE, I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THIS. DONALD TRUMP THINKS HEALTH CARE IS A PRIVILEGE. I THINK IT IS A RIGHT! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] I WILL NOT ONLY RESTORE HEALTH CARE, I WILL BUILD ON IT. YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE IF YOU HAVE IT OR CHOOSE A MEDICARE-LIKE OPTION. WE WILL INCREASE SUBSIDIES TO LOWER YOUR DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING, SURPRISE BILLING. HOW WILL YOU DO THAT? TRUMP AND HIS BUDDIES WILL PAY MORE TAXES SO YOU'LL HAVE TO DO MORE. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] WE WILL REDUCE , IF IT DIDN'T SOUND SO STRANGE I WOULD NOT EVEN EXPLAIN IT , WE WILL REDUCE RESTRUCTURING , PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BY 60% TO MAKE SURE MEDICARE CAN NEGOTIATE WITH DRUG COMPANIES FOR THE COST OF DRUGS. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. MEANWHILE , THESE GUYS ARE REAL, UNFORTUNATELY. MEANWHILE, TRUMP HAS ANNOUNCED WHAT HE WILL DO IF HE GETS REELECTED WITH REGARDS TO SOCIAL SECURITY. THE ACTUARY OF SOCIAL SECURITY HAS SAID TRUMP WERE ELECTED AND CAN PASS WHAT HE WANTS, IT WILL BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BY 2023. YOU THINK I'M MAKING IT UP, BUT JUST LIKE I SAID WHEN PAUL RYAN WAS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, I SAID THEY ARE GOING TO CUT MEDICARE. EVERYBODY SAID NO, NO. THEY TRIED TO CUT IT BY $5 BILLION RIGHT OFF THE BAT. FOLKS, THESE GUYS ARE SERIOUS. THEY NEVER FULLY SUPPORTED THESE PROGRAMS. I WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, YOU HAVE MY WORD ON IT. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, AS WE USED TO SAY IN THE SENATE, EXCUSE A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE , NOTHING HAS MADE ME MORE ANGRY ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT THAN THE WAY HE HAS SPOKEN ABOUT THOSE OF YOU WHO SERVED IN UNIFORM. LOSERS AND SUCKERS, HE REFERRED TO YOU. OUR SON BEAUU, HIS TWO CHILDREN ARE WITH US TONIGHT. HE GAVE UP HIS JOB AS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR, HE WON THE BRONZE STAR, THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MEDAL, AND CAME BACK WITH BRAIN CANCER. GUESS WHAT? HE WASN'T A SUCKER, HE WAS A PATRIOT! [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] LIKE ALL OF YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS! IT ANGERS THE HELL OUT OF ME THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT OUR VETERANS. YOUR PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS, ALL WHO SERVED. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, HE IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS SIX GENERALS AND ADMIRALS WHO WORKED IN HIS ADMINISTRATION WHO LEFT AND SAID HE WAS UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. FOLKS, A FORMER COMMANDER OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS FOR THE OSAMA BIN LADEN RAID, 22 OTHER FOUR STARS, THEY ENDORSED ME BECAUSE THEY KNOW I WILL HAVE THEIR BACK. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] TRUMP LIKES TO PORTRAY HIMSELF AS A TOUGH GUY, A MACHO MAN. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE A SHOT? ANYWAY. A MACHO MAN. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME , AND HE SAYS PEOPLE LISTEN TO HIM BECAUSE HE IS TOUGH AROUND THE WORLD , WHEN HIS LAST TIME YOU HEARD OF A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES LITERALLY BEING LAUGHED AT OUT LOUD BY WORLD LEADERS WHEN HE SPOKE OF UNITED NATIONS? SO MUCH FOR LISTENING TO HIM. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES MET WITH THE NATO LEADERS AT THE NATO SUMMIT, OTHER WORLD LEADERS, PRESIDENTS, PRIME MINISTERS, AND BEFORE THEY REALIZED IT, THEY WERE ALL MAKING FUN OF HIM AS HE LEFT THE ROOM. FOLKS, CAN YOU BELIEVE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO ACTS LIKE VLADIMIR PUTIN'S PUPPY? PUTIN PUTS , ON THE HEAD OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS. IT IS A ROUGH AREA. TRUMP HAS BEEN FRIGHTENED TO CHALLENGE HIM AT ALL. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT STRONG, HE IS WEAK. THIS IS THE PRESIDENT, HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND SACRIFICE, HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND COURAGE, THE PHYSICAL COURAGE IT TAKES TO BE IN UNIFORM. FOLKS, WE ARE GOING TO SUPPORT OUR MILITARY, THEY ARE THE BACKBONE AND THE SPINE OF THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, WE HAVE TO VOTE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. DONALD TRUMP CALLS IT A HOAX. I CALL IT ABOUT OUR HEALTH AND THE ABILITY TO CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS RIGHT HERE IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. WE CAN COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE WITH AMERICAN INGENUITY AND MANUFACTURING, CREATING MILLIONS OF NEW HIGH PAYING UNION JOBS. LET ME BE CLEAR , I WILL NOT BAN FRACKING AND PENNSYLVANIA, I WILL PROTECT THOSE JOBS NO MATTER WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, I WILL, I WILL NO LONGER FUND WILL COMPANIES WITH SUBSIDIES, PERIOD. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] FOLKS, FOLKS, WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. WE ALSO HAVE TO UNIFY IT. WE ARE GOING TO ACT TO DELIVER RACIAL JUSTICE IN AMERICA. PROTESTING IS NOT BURNING AND LOOTING AND VIOLENCE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED, BUT THE PROTESTERS'S CRY FOR JUSTICE, GEORGE FLOYD, BREONNA TAYLOR, WALTER WALLACE, THEY WILL NOT SOON BE FORGOTTEN BY ME OR ANYONE IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY WILL INSPIRE A NEW WAVE OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA. WHEN I MET WITH FLOYD'S FAMILY, WHEN I WENT DOWN TO TEXAS, HE HAS A LITTLE DAUGHTER, SIX YEARS OLD. I KNELT DOWN TO TALK TO HER. SHE SAID MR. VICE PRESIDENT, MY DADDY IS GOING TO CHANGE AMERICA. MY DADDY IS GOING TO CHANGE AMERICA. GUESS WHAT? WE ALSO KNOW, WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REALIZE WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT JUSTICE IS NOT JUST ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE, IT IS ABOUT KNOWING TRUE JUSTICE IS ABOUT JOBS, BUILDING WEALTH FOR YOUR FAMILIES. NO ONE SHOULD BE WORKING TWO JOBS TO STAY IN POVERTY. WE NEED A MINIMUM OF $15 AN HOUR MINIMUM WAGE. [CHEERS AND HORNS HONKING] AND FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING, FIRST-TERM HOMEBUYERS, THEY WILL GET A $15,000 TAX CREDIT FROM ME. WE WILL PROVIDE CAPITAL FOR YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS TO START SMALL BUSINESSES. PROVIDE FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE, WHICH BY THE WAY, COSTS $6 BILLION A YEAR, AND WE SPEND ABOUT THAT MUCH GIVING BREAKS FOR RESOURCES. , RACE HORSES.

LATER ON FRIDAY NIGHT, JOE BIDEN ADDRESSES THE NATION FROM HIS CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. HE TALKED ABOUT HIS PLANS FOR THE COUNTRY INCLUDING HIS CALLS FOR THE NATION TO COME TOGETHER. GOOD EVENING, MY FELLOW AMERICANS. WE DON'T HAVE A FINAL DECLARATION OF VICTORY YET BUT THE NUMBERS TELL US IT IS CLEAR , A CLEAR AND CONVINCING STORY. WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS RACE. JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE YESTERDAY. 24 HOURS, WE WERE BEHIND IN GEORGIA, NOW WE ARE AHEAD. AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN THAT STATE. 24 HOURS AGO, WE WERE BEHIND IN PENNSYLVANIA, AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA. AND NOW WE ARE AHEAD, WINNING IN ARIZONA, WINNING IN NEVADA. IN FACT, OUR LEAD DOUBLED IN NEVADA. WE ARE ON TRACK TO OVER 300 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES. AND LOOK AT THE NATIONAL NUMBERS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS RACE WITH A CLEAR MAJORITY OF THE NATION BEHIND US. WE HAVE GOTTEN OVER 74 MILLION VOTES. LET ME REPEAT THAT, AT 74 MILLION VOTES, THAT IS MORE THAN ANY PRESIDENTIAL TICKET HAS EVER GOTTEN IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND OUR VOTE TOTAL IS STILL GROWING. WE ARE BEATING DONALD TRUMP BY 4 MILLION VOTES, AND THAT IS A MARGIN THAT IS STILL GROWING AS WELL. ONE OF THE THINGS I'M ESPECIALLY PROUD OF IS HOW WELL WE HAVE DONE ACROSS AMERICA. AND WE ARE GOING TO BE THE FIRST DEMOCRAT TO WIN IN ARIZONA IN 24 YEARS. WE ARE GOING TO BE THE FIRST DEMOCRAT TO WIN GEORGIA IN 28 YEARS. AND WE HAVE REBUILT THE BLUE WALL, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY, THAT CRUMPLED JUST FOUR YEARS AGO. PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, THE HEARTLAND OF THIS NATION. I KNOW WATCHING THESE VOTE TALLIES ON TV MOVES VERY SLOWLY, AND AS SLOW AS IT GOES, IT CAN BE NUMBING. BUT NEVER FORGET, THE TALLIES ARE NOT JUST NUMBERS. THEY REPRESENT VOTES AND VOTERS. MEN AND WOMEN WHO EXERCISE THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD. AND WHAT IS BECOMING CLEAR EACH HOUR IS THAT A RECORD NUMBERS OF AMERICANS OF ALL FAITHS AND RELIGIONS SHOWS CHANGE OVER MORE , CHOSE CHANGE OVER MORE OF THE SAME. THEY HAVE GIVEN US A MANDATE FOR ACTION ON COVID, THE ECONOMY, CLIMATE CHANGE, SYSTEMIC RACISM. THEY MADE IT CLEAR, THEY WANT THE COUNTRY TO COME TOGETHER, NOT CONTINUE TO PULL APART. THE PEOPLE SPOKE. MORE THAN 74 MILLION AMERICANS. AND THEY SPOKE LOUDLY FOR OUR TICKET. BUT WHILE WE ARE WAITING FOR THE FINAL RESULTS, I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT WAITING TO GET THE WORK DONE AND START THE PROCESS. YESTERDAY SENATOR HARRIS AND I HELD MEETINGS WITH GROUPS OF EXPERTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THIS COUNTRY IS FACING. THE PANDEMIC, AS YOU ALSO KNOW, IS GETTING MORE WORRISOME ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. DAILY CASES ARE SKYROCKETING. IT IS NOW BELIEVED WE COULD SEE A SPIKE OF 200,000 CASES IN A SINGLE DAY. THE DEATH TOLL IS APPROACHING 240,000 LIVES LOST TO THIS VIRUS. THAT IS 240,000 EMPTY CHAIRS AT KITCHEN TABLES ACROSS AMERICA. WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO MEASURE THAT PAIN AND SUFFERING AND LOSS SO MANY FAMILIES EXPERIENCED. WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO LOSE SOMEONE, AND I WANT THEM TO KNOW THEY ARE NOT ALONE. OUR HEARTS BREAK WITH YOU. WE WANT EVERYONE, EVERYONE TO KNOW ON DAY ONE, WE ARE GOING TO PUT OUR PLAN TO CONTROL THIS VIRUS INTO ACTION. WE CANNOT SAVE ANY OF THE LIVES LOST, ANY OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN LOST, BUT WE CAN SAVE A LOT OF LIVES IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. SENATOR HARRIS AND I ALSO HEARD YESTERDAY ABOUT HOW THIS RECOVERY IS SLOWING, BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE TO GET THE PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL. MORE THAN 20 MILLION PEOPLE ARE ON UNEMPLOYMENT. MILLIONS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING RENT, AND PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. OUR ECONOMIC PLAN WILL PUT A FOCUS ON A PATH TO A STRONG RECOVERY. LOOK, WE BOTH KNOW TENSIONS ARE HIGH. THEY CAN BE HIGH AFTER A TOUGH ELECTION, ONE LIKE WE HAVE HAD. BUT REMEMBER, WE HAVE TO REMAIN CALM, PATIENT. LET THE PROCESS WORK OUT, AS WE COUNT ALL THE VOTES. WE ARE PROVING AGAIN WHAT WE HAVE PROVED FOR 244 YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY, DEMOCRACY WORKS. YOUR VOTE WILL BE COUNTED. I DO NOT CARE HOW HARD PEOPLE TRY TO STOP IT. I WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN. THE PEOPLE WILL BE HEARD. OUR JOURNEY IS TOWARD A MORE PERFECT UNION. AND IT KEEPS MOVING ON. IN AMERICA, WE HOLD STRONG VIEWS, WE HAVE STRONG DISAGREEMENTS, AND THAT IS OK. STRONG DISAGREEMENTS ARE INEVITABLE IN A DEMOCRACY, AND STRONG DISCRETENESS ARE HEALTHY. , AND STRONG DISAGREEMENTS ARE HEALTHY. THEY ARE A SIGN OF A VIGOROUS DEBATE, OF DEEPLY HELD VIEWS. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, THE PURPOSE OF OUR POLITICS IS NOT TOTAL, UNRELENTING, UNENDING WARFARE, NO. THE PURPOSE OF OUR POLITICS, THE WORK OF THE NATION, IS NOT TO FAN THE FLAMES OF CONFLICT, BUT TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. TO GUARANTEE JUSTICE. TO GIVE EVERYBODY A FAIR SHOT. TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF OUR PEOPLE. WE MAY BE OPPONENTS, BUT WE ARE NOT ENEMIES. WE ARE AMERICANS. NO MATTER WHO YOU VOTED FOR, I AM CERTAIN OF ONE THING. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE 150 MILLION AMERICANS WHO VOTED, THEY WANT TO GET THE VITRIOL OUT OF OUR POLITICS. WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO AGREE ON A LOT OF ISSUES BUT WE CAN AGREE TO BE CIVIL TO ONE ANOTHER. LET'S PUT THE ANGER AND DEMONIZATION BEHIND US. IT IS TIME FOR US TO COME TOGETHER AS A NATION TO HEAL. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY BUT WE HAVE TO TRY. MY RESPONSIBILITY AS PRESIDENT WILL BE TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE NATION. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO VOTED AGAINST ME, AS THOSE WHO VOTED FOR ME. THAT IS THE JOB. THAT IS THE JOB. IT IS CALLED THE DUTY OF CARE, FOR ALL AMERICANS. WE HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH. COVID. THE ECONOMY. RACIAL JUSTICE. CLIMATE CHANGE. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE TIME TO WASTE ON PARTISAN WARFARE. MORE THAN THAT, WE HAVE SUCH AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THE FUTURE WE WANT FOR OUR KIDS AND OUR GRANDKIDS. I HAVE SAID MANY, MANY TIMES, I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS NATION. THERE IS NO REASON WE CANNOT OWN THE 21ST CENTURY. WE JUST NEED TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING, ANYTHING, WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DO OR UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH, WHEN WE HAVE DONE IT TOGETHER. I HOPE TO BE TALKING TO TOMORROW.

IT'S TIME FOR ORDINARY FOLKS TO HAVE REPRESENTATION IN WASHINGTON, AND IF YOU SEND ME T O THE SENATE, EVERY SINGLE DAY I WILL HAVE GEORGIA ON MY MIND. I WON'T BE THINKING ABOUT HOW I CAN BEST REPRESENT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, AND HOW I CAN BEST REPRESENT THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THEY HAVE ENOUGH REPRESENTATIVES. IT'S TIME FOR ORDINARY FOLKS TO HAVE SOMEBODY SPEAKING ABOUT THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND SO, LISTEN, WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO. THE STAKES OF THIS ELECTION CAN HARDLY BE OVERSTATED. WE'VE HAD ABOUT 350,000 AMERICAN SOULS PERISH. THAT'S A LOT OF EMPTY SEATS AT THANKSGIVING. THAT'S A LOT OF EMPTY CHAIRS AT CHRISTMAS. THE LIGHTING OF THE CHANUKAH CANDLES. THAT'S A LOT OF EMPTY SPACES AS WE WELCOMED THE NEW YEAR AND FOLKS THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR LOVED ONES WERE NO LONGER WITH THEM. AND EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNSPEAKABLE HUMAN PAIN AND SUFFERING, WHAT DID WE WITNESS. WE SAW THE POLITICIANS PLAYING GAMES. POLITICIANS WHO WERE SO FOCUSED ON THE NEXT ELECTION, THAT THEY ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION. THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST. YOU HEARD THE DEBATE THIS WEEK. TOO OFTEN IT WAS REALLY ABOUT THE POLITICIANS. WHO IS UP AND WHO IS DOWN, WHO IS IN AND WHO IS OUT, WHO IS WINNING AND WHO IS LOSING. MEANWHILE, AS I WALK ACROSS THE STREETS OF ATLANTA, AND ACROSS THE STREETS OF GEORGIA, THE PEOPLE ARE LOSING EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND THEY NEED A VOICE IN THEIR DEMOCRACY. THEY NEED SENATORS WHO UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE GOT TO GET THIS VIRUS UNDER CONTROL. THAT WE HAVE GOT TO GET THIS VACCINE SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY DISTRIBUTED. THAT WE'VE GOT TO STAND UP AND WE HAVE GOT TO PROVIDE COVID RELIEF TO WORKERS. WE HAVE GOT TO HELP THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO WORK SAFELY. AND WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CENTER THE CONCERNS OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. WE HAVE GOT WORK TO DO, AND IN THE MIDST OF THE WORK THAT WE MUST DO, WE CAN HARDLY AFFORD TO BE DIVIDED. AND SO HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE GOT TO DO. YOU'VE GOT TO TELL YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO VOTE TOMORROW. AND WHEN THEY SHOW UP TO VOTE, HERE'S THE WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING, HERE'S THE IMPORTANT MORAL WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING. THEY ARE PUSHING HARD AGAINST THE FORCES OF DIVISION AND DISTRACTION IN OUR POLITICS. BECAUSE THERE ARE FOLKS WH OARE , WHO ARE TRYING SO HARD TO DIVIDE US. I'M RUNNING AGAINST THE UNELECTED SENATOR OF GEORGIA. [CARS HONKING] SHE WAS APPOINTED. THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED. SHE GIVES A LOT OF MONEY TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND SOMEHOW, SHE GOT A SEAT. AND WHEN SHE WENT TO THAT SEAT, SHE DID NOT WASTE MUCH TIME. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHY SHE WANTED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. SHE HA BARELY UNPACKEDD, HAD BEEN THERE THREE WEEKS. WHEN SHE HEARD ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON THE FOLKS WHO WERE SHELTERING IN, SHE WAS FOCUSED ON SHELTERING HER OWN INVESTMENTS. PROFITING OFF OF A PANDEMIC, WHILE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA WERE SUFFERING AND LOSING THEIR JOBS. AND WHEN IT CAME TIME TO GIVE ORDINARY PEOPLE SOME RELIEF, SHE SAID I SEE NO NEED. SHE SAYS IT WAS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. MEANWHILE, SHE WAS PROFITING OFF OF THE PANDEMIC. WHO DOES THAT? WHO DOES THAT? FORGIVE ME, I AM FROM THE HOOD. WHERE I AM FROM, WE WOULD SAY WHERE THEY DO THAT AT? PROFITING OFF OF A PANDEMIC. AND SO, HAVE YOU NOTICED, SHE HASN'T EVEN BOTHERED TO MAKE HER CASE, GEORGIA, FOR WHY YOU SHOULD KEEP HER IN THAT SEAT? THAT'S BECAUSE SHE HAS NO CASE TO MAKE. INSTEAD, SHE IS TRYING TO DISTRACT YOU. TRYING TO MISREPRESENT MY RECORD. HAVE YOU NOTICED? LYING ON ME. LYING ON MY CHURCH. THE SPIRITUAL HOME OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.. LYING ON THE GOSPEL. AS WE SAY IN CHURCH, CALLING ME EVERYTHING BUT A CHILD OF GOD. SCANDALIZE MY NAME. , SCANDALIZING MY NAME. BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT. MY MOTHER DOWN IN SAVANNAH, GEORGIA SAYS IT IS NOT WHAT THEY CALL YOU, IT IS WHAT YOU ANSWER BY. AND IN A FEW DAYS, SHE CAN CALL ME SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] AND AS WE BUILD THIS MOVEMENT, AS WE MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS ENGAGED AND EVERYBODY IS INVOLVED, WE WILL CONTINUE THIS BLUE WAVE THAT WILL MAKE ITS WAY ALL ACROSS THE STATE. THE RIPPLES OF WHICH WILL BE FELT ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. GEORGIA, ARE YOU READY TO WIN THIS ELECTION? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] SO DON'T SLEEP THROUGH THIS MOVEMENT. DON'T SLEEP THROUGH THIS MOMENT. THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE. MY FATHER USED TO WAKE ME EVERY MORNING, RAIN OR SHINE. SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. WEEKDAYS, SATURDAYS, SUNDAYS. DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR, DURING THE SUMMER. YOU COULD NOT SLEEP IN MY DADDY'S HOUSE. HE WAS A VETERAN DURING THE WORLD WAR II ERA. AND HE NEVER LOST THAT SENSE THAT YOU OUGHT TO GET UP, GET DRESSED, PUT SHOES ON, GET READY. I SAID DAD, WHAT DEEMING GET READY , WHAT DO YOU MEAN GET READY? IT'S SATURDAY? GET READY FOR WHAT? HE SAID I DON'T KNOW. JUST PUT SHOES ON, BOY. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO LATER, JUST MAKE SURE YOU'RE READY. THAT ANNOYED ME WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY, WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER, BUT I AM SO GLAD THAT MY DAD WOKE ME UP EVERY MORNING, GOD BLESSES SOUL, BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW GEORGIA, I AM READY, I AM READY TO BE YOUR NEXT UNITED STATES SENATOR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] I'M READY TO WORK ALONGSIDE MY BROTHER JON OSSOFF AS YOU SEND US TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THINK ABOUT THIS. IN THIS DEFINING MOMENT, WHEN FOLKS ARE TRYING TO DIVIDE US, GEORGE IS GETTING READY TO SEND TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, A YOUNG, JEWISH MAN, THE SON OF AN IMMIGRANT, AND A BLACK PREACHER, THE PASTOR OF EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH, WHERE MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR USED TO SERVE AND WHERE JOHN LEWIS WORSHIPED. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I AM SO PROUD OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA. LET THEM HEAR YOU ROAR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CAN I ASK YOU ONE MORE TIME, ARE YOU READY TO WIN THIS ELECTION? WELL CALL EVERYBODY YOU KNOW AND TELL THEM TO GET UP, GET DRESSED, PUT YOUR SHOES ON, GET READY, FOR AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. GET READY FOR A LIVABLE WAGE. GET READY TO RECLAIM OUR DEMOCRACY, AND RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. GOD BLESS YOU. LET'S WIN THE FUTURE. (music) [(music) STEVIE WONDER'S \"SUPERSTITION\" (music) (music)] YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. LET'S KEEP THIS ENERGY GOING. ARE YOU ALREADY TO WIN TOMORROW? I SAID ARE WE READY TO WIN TOMORROW? WHAT'S UP? ALL RIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT GOING. WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, I BRING TO YOU, JON OSSOFF TO THE STAGE. WHAT'S UP? (music) [(music) OUTKAST'S \"THE WAY YOU MOVE\" (music) (music)] HELLO, ATLANTA. FOREVER I LOVE ATLANTA. GIVE IT UP AGAIN FOR MY BROTHER, THE REVEREND RAPHAEL WARNOCK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ATLANTA, GEORGIA, IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS. TOMORROW IS ELECTION DAY. THE EYES OF THE NATION ARE ON GEORGIA RIGHT NOW. THE EYES OF THE WORLD ARE ON GEORGIA RIGHT NOW. FEEL YOUR POWER, GEORGIA. TOMORROW, WE MAKE HISTORY. NOW, I WANT YOU TO SAY IT WITH ME NOW. SAVE VOTE. , SAY VOTE. SAY VOTE. SAY VOTE. TOMORROW, WE MAKE HISTORY. AND THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME, ATLANTA. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME IN THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH. GEORGIA IS THE MOST COMPETITIVE BATTLEGROUND STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU DID THAT. YOU DID THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND NOW HOSTING TWO RUNOFF ELECTIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO DETERMINE CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE. YOUR STANDARDBEARERS ARE THE YOUNG JEWISH SON OF AN IMMIGRANT AND A PASTOR WHO HOLDS DR. KING'S PULPIT AT THE CHURCH. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME, ATLANTA. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME. AND WE ARE RUNNING AGAINST , WE ARE RUNNING AGAINST LIKE, THE BONNY AND CLYDE OF CORRUPTION IN AMERICAN POLITICS. TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS, WHO WHEN THEY LEARNED ABOUT THIS PANDEMIC THAT WAS BEARING DOWN ON OUR SHORES, WHEN THEY LEARNED ABOUT THE THREAT POSED BY A VIRUS THAT HAS NOW KILLED MORE THAN 300,000 OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS, THEIR FIRST CALL WAS TO THEIR STOCKBROKER. ATLANTA, WE DESERVE BETTER, AND RETIREMENT IS COMING FOR DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER, AT LANTA. [CARS HONKING] BUT SEE, WE HAVE BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS TO DISCUSS THAN DAVID AND KELLY. LIKE WHERE WE GO FROM HERE AS A PEOPLE. WHERE WE GO FROM HERE AS A COMMUNITY, AS AST STATE, AS A NATION. WE HAVE HAD FOUR YEARS OF BIGOTRY, LIES AND INCOMPETENCE. BUT DONALD TRUMP IS LEAVING. AND GEORGIA VOTERS SENT DONALD TRUMP PACKING. YOU DID THAT. SO NOW IT'S TIME TO REBUILD. NOW IT'S TIME TO BUILD AN AMERICA THAT IS DEFINED BY LOVE, THAT IS DEFINED BY UNITY, THAT IS DEFINED BY COMPASSION AND EMPATHY. THOSE ARE THE SUBSTANCES OF COMMUNITY. THOSE MUST BE OUR GUIDING LIGHTS, BECAUSE WE LOVE EACH OTHER. I'M GOING TO TAKE A PAGE OUT OF THE REVEREND'S PLAYBOOK. TURN TO YOUR NEIGHBOR AND TELL THEM YOU LOVE THEM. THIS IS ABOUT LOVE. I LOVE YOU, TOO. AND WE ARE BUILDING A MOVEMENT BASED ON LOVE, FOR HEALTH, JOBS, AND JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE. HEALTH, JOBS, AND JUSTICE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE, ATLANTA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S TALK ABOUT HEALTH FOR A MOMENT. 300,000 AMERICANS KILLED BY THIS VIRUS. OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS, OR NURSING HOMES, BUCKLING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC. SO MANY WHO HAVE LOST SO MUCH. LOVED ONES, BURIED. LOVED ONES WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES, UNABLE TO SEE OR TOUCH THEIR LOVED ONES AS THEY PASS. A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS LIED TO US EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. WE CAN BEAT COVID-19, ATLANTA. WE CAN PASS LEGISLATION TO RUSH RESOURCES TO HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES. WE CAN MAKE SURE EVERY AMERICAN GETS ACCESS TO TESTING AND VACCINE FREE OF CHARGE. WE CAN BEAT COVID-19 AND GET OUR DAILY LIVES BACK. AND DO YOU BELIEVE, LIKE I DO ATLANTA, AND LIKE REV. WARNOCK DOES, THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT? HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS, OR WHO LIVE IN THE RIGHT ZIP CODE. I WAS JUST DOWN AND CUSTARD, GEORGIA A FEW DAYS AGO. RANDOLPH COUNTY IN SOUTH GEORGIA. YA'LL, THEY LOST THEIR HOSPITAL IN OCTOBER. HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, THEIR HOSPITAL CLOSED. AND NOW THE PEOPLE OF RANDOLPH COUNTY, IF THEY NEED AN EMERGENCY ROOM, THEY HAVE TO DRIVE 1.5 HOURS TO TO GO TO COLUMBUS OR ALBANY. IT'S ONE OF NINE HOSPITALS WE HAVE LOST IN GEORGIA IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. YOU SEND ME AN REV. WARNOCK TO THE SENATE WE WILL DELIVER THE RESOURCES TO REOPEN THOSE NINE HOSPITALS AND TO BUILD NEW CLINICS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE HAS HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. WE WILL STAND UP TO THE DRUG COMPANIES THAT ARE RISK , RIPPING OFF YOUR TO FAMILIES AT THE PHARMACY EVERY DAY. CHARGING OUTRAGEOUS PRICES FOR LIFE-SAVING MEDICINE AND INSULIN. WE WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN HAS GREAT HEALTH INSURANCE NOMAD OR THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. WHETHER THEY HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, SUFFERING FROM ASTHMA, DIABETES OR A CANCER SURVIVOR. BECAUSE HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND WE WILL MAKE IT SO IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HORNS HONKING] LET ME GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO ALL THE MOTHERS OUT THERE. LET ME GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO MY MAMA, WHO IS HERE. I LOVE YOU, MOM. Y'ALL MAY NOT KNOW THIS, BUT MY WIFE WORKS AS AN OB\/GYN DR. AT GRADY HOSPITAL, IN LABOR AND DELIVERY RIGHT HERE IN ATLANTA. SHE SEES, EVERY DAY AT WORK, MOTHERS WHO STRUGGLE, WHO SUFFER. BABIES WHO STRUGGLE INTO THIS WORLD BECAUSE OUR LEADERS HAVE REFUSED TO EXPAND MEDICAID. BECAUSE OUR LEADERS HAVE REFUSED TO INVEST IN MATERNAL HEALTH. WE HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY HERE IN GEORGIA. IF YOU SEND ME AN REV. WARNOCK TO THE SENATE, WHEN YOU SEND ME AN REV. WARNOCK TO THE SENATE, WE WILL SURGE RESOURCES TO SAVE LIVES TO MAKE SURE EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE AS AN OB\/GYN DOCTOR. BECAUSE HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT, ATLANTA. HEALTH, JOBS AND JUSTICE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT JOBS. MILLIONS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS DURING THIS CRISIS. MILLIONS FACING EVICTION AND FORECLOSURE. SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS OUR STATE OPERATING AT 20% OR 30% CAPACITY GAS BILLS PILING UP, CREDIT CARDS MAXED OUT, FAMILIES THAT CAN'T AFFORD CHILDCARE. AND FOR EIGHT MONTHS STRAIGHT, THE UNITED STATES SENATE BLOCKED THE DIRECT RELEASE THAT THE PEOPLE NEEDED. LET HIM NEVER DECEIVE YOU. DAVID PURDUE OPPOSED DIRECT STIMULUS FOR THE PEOPLE ALL YEAR LONG. LAST WEEK DAVID PURDUE CHANGED HIS TUNE. GUESS WHAT, THERE'S AN ELECTION COMING. GEORGIA, YOU DESERVE SENATORS WHO HAVE YOUR BACK NOT JUST WHEN THEY ARE ABOUT TO FACE THE PEOPLE, BUT AT ALL TIMES. AND WHEN YOU SEND ME AN REV. WARNOCK TO THE SENATE, WE WILL PASS THOSE $2000 STIMULUS CHECKS THAT THE PEOPLE NEED, THAT THE FAMILIES NEED TO STAY ON THEIR FEET AND IN THEIR HOMES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE WILL PASS THE MOST AMBITIOUS JOBS INFRASTRUCTURE , JOBS, INFRASTRUCTURE AND RECOVERY PROGRAM IN U.S. HISTORY. WE WILL UPGRADE OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, WE WILL UPGRADE TRANSIT AND TRANSPORTATION TO CONNECT EVERY TOWN AND COUNTY AND CONNECT EVERY CITY, EVERY QUARTER , CORNER OF THE STATE AND CONNECT GEORGIA WITH THE REST OF THE SOUTHEAST. WE WILL CREATE TENS AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY, SAVING OUR PLANET WHILE WE MAKE AMERICA THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF CLEAN ENERGY IN THE WORLD, AND GEORGIA THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF CLEAN ENERGY IN THE SOUTH. I WANT YOU TO FEEL WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE TOGETHER. I WANT YOU TO FEEL WHAT IS POSSIBLE. I WANT YOU TO BELIEVE IN WHAT IS POSSIBLE. HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE. IF MITCH MCCONNELL AND THE REPUBLICANS HOLD ON TO THE SENATE, THEY WILL TRY TO DO TO JOE AND KAMALA EXACTLY LIKE THEY TRIED TO DO TO PRESIDENT OBAMA. BUT WE HAVE TOO MUCH GOOD WORK TO DO FOR THINGS TO BE GROUND TO A HALT IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL. WE NEED TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $15. WE NEED TO EXTEND THE PELL GRANT PROGRAM SO NO YOUNG PERSON IN THE STATE HAS TO TAKE ON DEBT TO GET A DEGREE FROM A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR FROM AN HBCU. WE NEED TO RELIEVE THE BURDEN OF STUDENT DEBT FROM THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY STRUGGLING TO GET OUT FROM UNDER THEIR LOW. WE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS WHEN WE WIN TOMORROW. WE CAN DELIVER HEALTH, JOBS AND JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE. FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT JUSTICE. LET'S TALK ABOUT JUSTICE. I MENTIONED MY MOTHER A FEW MINUTES AGO. MY MOTHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AS AN IMMIGRANT WHEN SHE WAS 23 YEARS OLD. A LOAN AS A YOUNG WOMAN. IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE TO UPROOT YOUR LIFE AT THAT AGE. MOVED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET. , PLANET AND START NEW. BUT LIKE SO MANY IMMIGRANTS, MY MOTHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES THAT HER COUNTRY STOOD FOR CERTAIN IDEALS. LET ME BE CLEAR THAT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT SHE INDULGED ANY FANTASIES ABOUT OUR PAST. THAT DID NOT MEAN SHE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH FURTHER AMERICA HAD TO GO. SHE BECAME A YOUNG ACTIVIST. MY MOTHER WAS MARCHING IN THE STREETS FOR THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT IN THE 1970'S. SHE HAD ME WALKING AROUND THE HOUSE WHEN I WAS THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD WITH AN E.R.A. BUTTON ON. NOW YOU SEE WHERE I'M COMING FROM. MY MOTHER BECAME A CITIZEN BECAUSE SHE RECOGNIZED THAT THE BALLOT BOX IS WHERE WE DEMAND PROGRESS. THE BALLOT BOX IS WHERE WE HOLD ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE. THE BALLOT BOX IS WHERE WE ENSURE THAT THIS COUNTRY KEEPS MOVING ON A JOURNEY OF PROGRESS, TOWARDS FULLY REALIZING THE VERY BEST OF OUR FOUNDING IDEALS. IN GOD'S EYES. EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL. EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL. OUR CONSTITUTION ALREADY GUARANTEES EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. BUT WHEN AHMAUD ARBERY IS SHOT TO DEATH IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, IN THE STREET, ON CAMERA, AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES LOOK THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE HE IS A YOUNG BLACK MAN, THAT MAKES A MOCKERY OF EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. SO, ATLANTA, ARE YOU READY TO PASS A NEW CIVIL RIGHTS ACT THAT WILL SECURE EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL, NO MATTER THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT TO PASS A NEW VOTING RIGHTS ACT THAT WILL SECURE THE SACRED FRANCHISE THAT JOHN LEWIS AND SO MANY BLED AND SUFFERED FOR? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT FOR HEALTH AND JOBS AND JUSTICE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE? ARE YOU READY TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT ECHOES NOT JUST FROM COAST TO COAST, BUT DOWN THE GENERATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE STATE STANDS FOR? [HORN HONKING] ATLANTIC, WE JUST HAVE A FEW HOURS LEFT. I AM ASKING YOU TO DREAM ABOUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE. I'M ASKING YOU TO BELIEVE IN WHAT'S POSSIBLE. I'M ASKING YOU TO WORK TO MAKE REAL WHAT IS POSSIBLE. NO REGRETS. NO REGRETS. WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF A HISTORIC VICTORY. FEEL IT. NO IT. BELIEVE IT , KNOW IT. BELIEVE IT. WORK FOR IT. ATLANTA, ARE YOU READY TO WORK? ATLANTA, ARE YOU READY TO WIN? ATLANTA, ARE YOU READY TO ELECT TO NEW UNITED STATES SENATORS? ATLANTA, SAY IT WITH ME AGAIN. SAVE BOAT , SAY VOTE. I LOVE YOU ALL. GOD BLESS YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) I LIKE THE WAY YOU MOVE I LOVE THE WAY YOU MOVE I LOVE THE WAY I LOVE THE WAY I LOVE THE WAY YOU MOVE I LOVE THE WAY YOU MOVE I LOVE THE WAY YOU MOVE I LOVE THE WAY I LOVE THE WAY (music)(music) (music) I DON'T HAVE WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE FEELING I HAD HOLDING THAT BALLOT IN MY HAND. FOR THE FIRST TIME, I HAD A VOICE. A VOICE THAT WOULD IMPACT OUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE. I DID NOT EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE THAT FEELING FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS . BUT, HERE WE ARE. TODAY, WE GEORGE IAN'S HAVE THE POWER TO BRING COVID-19 RELIEF, TO REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, TO MOVE TOWARDS CLEANER ENERGY. HOWEVER, NONE OF THIS CAN BE DONE IF WE DON'T ALL VOTE. WHETHER THIS IS YOUR FIRST ELECTION OR YOUR 20TH, YOUR VOTE WILL DICTATE THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE IN A TIME WHEN LEADERSHIP IS NEEDED. WE ARE IN A TIME WHEN OUR VOICES NEED TO BE LOUD. SO PLEASE, GEORGIA, USE YOUR VOTE, YOUR VOICE TO PUT JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK IN THE U.S. SENATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO AROUND GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD NOW [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) (music) PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK. LET'S HEAR IT FOR ALLY. THAT INTRODUCTION AND A GREAT LINEUP OF ENTERTAINERS YOU HAVE HAD. YOU ARE PROBABLY DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR A SPEAK AND WE WILL GET THE ENTERTAINERS BACK OUT HERE. LET'S HEAR IT FOR STACEY ABRAMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: NOBODY, NOBODY IN AMERICA HAS DONE MORE FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE THAN STACEY ABRAMS. YOU ARE CHANGING GEORGIA. YOU CHANGED AMERICA. I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK YOU AGAIN. LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE NEXT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONER, DANIEL BLACKMAN. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS, BUT I KNOW HE'S HERE. HE IS ONE OF THE BEST MAYORS AMERICA HAS. AND MY GOOD FRIEND KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS. IF I HAD THREE OF HER I COULD RULE THE WORLD. WE LOVE YOU. PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: I LOVE HER, I TELL YOU. LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE NEXT UNITED STATES SENATORS, JON OSSOFF AND REV. WARNOCK. THEY ARE TALENTED, THEY ARE PRINCIPLED, THEY ARE QUALIFIED, THEY ARE DECENT, THEY ARE HONORABLE, THEY MEAN WHAT THEY SAY AND THEY BELIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE THE DEFINITION OF AMERICA IS, IT'S ABOUT POSSIBILITIES A MIKE ANY OTHER NATION IN THE WORLD. ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. WE ARE GOING TOWARDS JUSTICE, HOPE AND PROGRESS. THAT IS NOT A HYPERBOLE, THAT ISRAEL. FULKS, THIS IS IT , , THAT IS REAL. FOLKS, THIS IS IT. TOMORROW CAN BE A NEW DAY FOR ATLANTA, GEORGIA, AND FOR AMERICA. FIRST, LET ME START BY SAYING THANK YOU FOR ELECTING ME AND, AS PRESIDENT , ME AND KAMALA AS PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU VOTED IN RECORD NUMBERS IN NOVEMBER. YOUR VOICES WERE HEARD. WE WON THREE TIMES HERE. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: I THINK WE SHOULD COUNT IT AS THREE STATES, NOT THREE TIMES. NOW, WE NEED YOU TO VOTE AGAIN IN RECORD NUMBERS. TO MAKE YOUR VOICES HEARD AGAIN AND AGAIN TO CHANGE GEORGIA, TO CHANGE AMERICA AGAIN. THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION, GEORGIA, THE WHOLE NATION IS LOOKING TO YOU TO LEAD US FORWARD. YOU KNOW IT. YOU CANNOT TURN ON ANY NATIONAL TELEVISION SHOW WITHOUT KNOWING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT ALL OF YOU ARE DOING. THE POWER IS LITERALLY IN YOUR HANDS. UNLIKE ANY TIME IN MY CAREER, ONE STATE, ONE STATE CAN CHART THE COURSE, NOT JUST FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, BUT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. BY ELECTING JON AND THE REVERENT, YOU CAN MAKE AN IMMEDIATE DIFFERENCE IN YOUR OWN LIVES. THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE THEIR ELECTION WILL PUT AN END TO THE BLOCK IN WASHINGTON ON THAT $2000 STIMULUS CHECK. THAT MONEY WILL GO OUT THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY TO PEOPLE IN REAL TROUBLE. PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. PAYING RENT. PAYING YOUR MORTGAGE. PAYING DOWN THE CREDIT CARD, PAYING THE PHONE BILL, THE GAS BILL, THE ELECTRIC BILL. JUST LOOK AROUND. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE OUT OF WORK THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. THEY ARE STRUGGLING. MANY ARE FEARFUL AND MANY HAVE GIVEN UP HOPE. LOOK AT THE LINES AT FOOD BANKS. HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR GOD'S SAKE, AND THERE ARE FOOD LINES THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE THE DEPRESSION. AND THEY ARE GETTING LONGER. FAMILIES, CHILDREN, PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED THEIR WHOLE LIVES AND NEVER ASKED FOR A THING EXCEPT A FIGHTING CHANCE. NOW THEY ARE LINING UP FOR FOOD IN AMERICA. AND THE DEBATE OVER $2000 ISN'T SOME ABSTRACT DEBATE IN WASHINGTON, IT'S ABOUT REAL LIVES, YOUR LIES, THE LIVES OF GOOD, HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. IF YOU ARE LIKE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, YOU NEED THE MONEY, YOU NEED THE HELP, AND YOU NEED IT NOW, LOOK, GEORGIA, THERE IS NO ONE IN AMERICA WITH MORE POWER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN THEN YOU, THE CITIZENS OF ATLANTA, THE CITIZENS OF GEORGIA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: AND THAT IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION, THAT IS LITERALLY TRUE. IF YOU SEND JOHN AND THE REVEREND TO WASHINGTON, THOSE $2000 CHECKS WILL GO OUT THE DOOR, RESTORING HOPE AND DECENCY AND HONOR TO SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. IF YOU SEND SENATORS PURDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER BACK TO WASHINGTON, THOSE CHECKS WILL NEVER GET THERE. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. THE POWER IS LITERALLY IN YOUR HANDS. BY ELECTING JON AND THE REVERENT, YOU CAN BREAK THE GRIDLOCK THAT HAS GRIPPED WASHINGTON AND DISH NATION. , DISH NATION. THEY CAN MAKE THE PROMISE , THIS NATION. THEY CAN MAKE THE PROMISE ON JOBS, ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH CARE. BY ELECTING JON AND THE REVEREND YOU ARE VOTING FOR STATES THAT NEED THE VACCINES TO GET DISTRIBUTED. IT IS A SHAME OF WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE, GETTING AMERICA VACCINATED WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THIS NATION HAS EVER FACED. BUT WE HAVE KNOWN IT FOR THE LAST MONTHS. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS GOTTEN OFF TO A GOD AWFUL START. THE PRESIDENT SPENT MORE TIME WHINING AND COMPLAINING BEEN DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: I DON'T KNOW WHY HE STILL WANTS THE JOB, HE DOES NOT WANT TO DO THE WORK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: LOOK, THE STATES NEED HELP. THERE IS A REASON WHY THE CONSTITUTION SAID THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE DEFICIT SPENDING IN TIMES OF CRISIS AND STATES HAVE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS. IT'S THE WHOLE IDEA, YOUR STATES HAVE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING? YOU WILL SEE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE LAID OFF. MORE FIREFIGHTERS, POLICE OFFICERS, SCHOOL TEACHERS, FIRST RESPONDERS, THE PEOPLE WE NEED BADLY NOW. THE STATES NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO WORK WITH THEM, NOT ATTACK THEM AND LEAVE THEM OUT THERE HANGING. IT WILL BE TOUGH TO GET THIS DONE, BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT. PEOPLE'S LIVES LITERALLY DEPEND ON IT. OUR ECONOMY DEPENDS ON IT. AND WE WILL GET IT DONE BY ELECTING JON AND THE REVERENT TO GET LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING TO THE STATES. TO KEEP COPS, FIREFIGHTERS, TEACHERS, KEEP THEM ON THE JOB, PROTECTING YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN. THEY ARE STRUGGLING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND THEY NEED HELP. BY ELECTING JON AND THE REVEREND YOU WILL SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE . IT IS TIME FOR THIS NATION TO FINALLY COME TOGETHER, TO FINALLY WORK TOGETHER, TEEN NIGHT WITH THE ANGER AND DIVISION AND DIVISIVE POLICIES PUT IN THE PAST. HERE IS ONE MORE THING, VOTING FOR JON AND THE REVEREND WON'T JUST BE GOOD FOR AMERICA, IT WILL BE GOOD FOR GEORGIA. AND HERE IS WHY. WHEN YOU VOTE FOR JON AND RAFAEL, YOU WILL VOTE FOR TWO SENATORS WHO WILL FIGHT FOR YOU AND PUT GEORGIA FIRST. WHO WILL PUT YOU FIRST. YOU DON'T HAVE THAT NOW. YOU HAVE TWO SENATORS WHO THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE WEALTH THAN HARD WORK. YOU HAVE TWO SENATORS WHO THINK THEY DON'T WORK FOR YOU, THEY WORK FOR TRUMP. THINK ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE TWO SENATORS WHO THINK THEIR LOYALTY IS TO TRUMP NOT TO GEORGIA. YOU HAVE TWO SENATORS WHO THINK THEY SWORE AN OATH TO DONALD TRUMP NOT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I GOT ELECTED WHEN I WAS 29 YEARS OLD AND SIX MORE TIMES IN DELAWARE. GUESS WHAT, NOT ONCE DID I THINK I TOOK AN OATH TO ANY PRESIDENT, DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. I TOOK AN OATH TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN: AND AS PRESIDENT, I DON'T BELIEVE UNITED STATES SENATORS ARE GOING TO WORK FOR ME, THEY WORK FOR THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA. THAT'S WHY I'M NOT ASKING YOUR SENATORS TO BE LOYAL TO ME. I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE LOYAL TO YOU, TO GEORGIA AND TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, PERIOD. AND IF YOU VOTE FOR JON AND THE REVEREND, THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL GET. DECENT, HONORABLE MAN. THEY WILL PUT A PRESIDENT OR PARTY FIRST, AND THEY SURE WON'T PUT THEMSELVES FIRST. THEY KNOW PUBLIC SERVICE IS ABOUT YOU. IT ISN'T ABOUT THEM, IT'S NOT ABOUT ENRICHING THEMSELVES, IT'S ABOUT MAKING PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER. ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE A CHANCE. IT'S TIME TO START REWARDING WORK AND NOT WEALTH. AND IF YOU LISTEN TO JON AND THE REVEREND, THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING, THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING ON. LOOK, I'M DEALING WITH COVID. I'M REVITALIZING OUR ECONOMY, OUR HEALTH CARE, OUR VOTING RIGHTS, TERMINAL JUSTICE, RACIAL JUSTICE, CLIMATE CHANGE, ON THE THINGS THAT MATTER AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF YOUR FAMILY. GEORGIA, AS DARK AS THESE DAYS THAT WE ARE SEEING, I'M STILL MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS COUNTRY THAN ANY TIME IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I REALLY MEAN IT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOW UNDERSTAND CLEARLY WHAT'S AT STAKE. AND JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK UNDERSTAND THAT. THEY SAW THE POWER OF BELIEVING IN THE PROMISE OF AMERICAN AND OUR DARKEST MONTHS. JOHN LEARNED IT FROM MY OLD FRIEND AND YOURS, JOHN LEWIS. REV. WARNOCK SEES THE POWER TO OVERCOME THE TOUGHEST TRIALS THAT LIFE CAN THROW AT US. HE BELIEVES AS I DO, IN THE QUOTE OF A PHILOSOPHER WHO SAID, FATE SEES BEST IN THE DARK. THE FAITH THAT ENABLES US TO OVERCOME ADVERSITY. TO LIFT EACH OTHER UP, TO BE A BEACON OF LIGHT TO ONE ANOTHER, AND FOR THE WORLD. THAT IS WHO WE ARE AND THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP ON. I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES AND I WILL SAY IT HERE AGAIN. THERE IS NOTHING, AND I SAY AGAIN, THERE IS NOTHING THIS COUNTRY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO WHEN WE DECIDE TO DO IT TOGETHER. WE HAVE FACED TOUGHER TIMES BEFORE, AND WE HAVE ALWAYS OVERCOME. WE HAVE ALWAYS OVERCOME. WE HAVE ALWAYS COME OUT BETTER THAN WE WENT IN. NO MATTER WHAT. I KNOW THESE , I KNOW THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN EXHAUSTING. YOU PUT THE HARD WORK IN OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS TO GET TO THIS MOMENT. IT HAS BEEN INTENSE. IT HAS BEEN NONSTOP. BUT I AM ASKING YOU TO GIVE EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT ONE MORE DAY. ONE MORE DAY. AND THAT ONE MORE DAY IS NOT A HYPERBOLE. YOU CAN CHANGE AMERICA. SO IF YOU HAVE NOT VOTED, BOAT. IF YOU ALREADY VOTED, THEN I ASK YOU FOR ONE MORE DAY OF MAKING CALLS AND SAFELY KNOCKING ON DOORS. GO TO IOWA VOTE.COM\/GA TO FIND YOUR POLLING LOCATION. JUST LIKE YOU DID IN NOVEMBER. BOAT, BOAT, BOAT. VOTE FOR JOHN AND THE REVERENT. IN AMERICA, FRIENDS ARE FINDING OUT ALL POWER FLOWS FROM THE PEOPLE. FROM THE PEOPLE. THAT IS OUR HISTORY. THAT IS OUR TRADITION, THAT'S OUR CONSTITUTION, THAT'S OUR DEMOCRACY. POLITICIANS CANNOT ASSERT, TAKE OR SEIZED POWER. POWER IS GIVEN, GRANTED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALONE. AND WE CAN NEVER GIVE THAT UP. IT'S ALWAYS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE THAT MUST PREVAIL. SO TODAY, TOMORROW, MAKE SURE YOUR VOICE IS HEARD. DO IT FOR YOURSELVES, DO IT FOR YOUR FAMILIES, DO IT FOR YOUR CHILDREN, DO IT FOR YOUR STATE AND YOUR COUNTRY. DO IT FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN UP SO MUCH. THINK OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN UP SO MUCH TO SECURE THAT RIGHT. DO IT FOR THE COUNTRY YOU LOVE, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU LOVE THIS COUNTRY. IN THE FUTURE YOU WANT TO BUILD FOR EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY. DO IT FOR ALL THOSE AROUND THE WORLD WHO ASPIRE LIKE US TO BE FREE AND THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE WHO LOOK TO US. I HAVE BEEN TO ALMOST OVER 100 COUNTRIES AND ALL LOOK TO AMERICA. THE POWER IS IN YOUR HANDS. JON AND THE REVEREND ARE COUNTING ON YOU. SO IS KAMALA, SO AM I AND SO IS THE NATION. WE ARE A NATION BUILT ON HONOR BUILT ON DECENCY AND RESPECT. AMERICA IS AND MUST CONTINUE TO BE A BEACON OF LIFE, LIBERTY, DEMOCRACY AND UNITY. THAT IS WHO WE ARE. THAT'S THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. VOTE, VOTE, VOTE. BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. (music) GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO AROUND.
