CSPANMP17120190	Mike Pence	2019-01-17	President Trump Remarks on Missile Defense Review	Speech	Thank you, Acting Secretary Shanahan, Secretary Mark Esper, Secretary Wilson, distinguished members of Congress, members of the Joint Chiefs, the leadership of the Armed Forces of the United States, and to all of you who wear the uniform of the United States of America. It is my honor to be with you here today at the Pentagon as our President unveils his vision for our renewed commitment to American missile defense. As Commander-in-Chief, President Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people. And it's, frankly, the greatest honor of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families. Today, along with all of you, our hearts and our prayers are with the families of the fallen American heroes who were lost in Syria yesterday, as well as those service members who were wounded. We honor their service and we will honor the memory of the fallen. And their families and our Armed Forces should know their sacrifice will only steel our resolve; that as we begin to bring our troops home, we will do so in a way that ensures that the remnants of ISIS will never be able to reestablish their evil and murderous caliphate. It's in that same spirit of resolve that we gather here today. Since day one of this administration, President Trump has taken decisive action to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. Working with members of Congress in both parties, we're rebuilding our military, restoring the arsenal of democracy. And last year, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the largest military pay raise in nearly a decade. At the President's direction, we released a National Security Strategy that puts America first, pursued the modernization of our nuclear arsenal. And President Trump has taken decisive action to extend American dominance on land, at sea, in air, and in cyberspace, and even called for the establishment of a sixth branch of our Armed Forces to ensure American dominance in space. In the last two years, our President has made great progress to provide for the common defense. And today, by unveiling our new strategy for missile defense, President Trump will take another critical step to ensure the safety and security of the American people and our very way of life. This President knows that the American people believe that America First begins with peace through strength. So now it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce your Commander-in-Chief, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.

And I want to commend each and every one of you for being a part of that incredible tradition and it's a remarkable contribution worth dwelling on in a time when Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has come under criticism by some politicians not only here in Georgia but across the country where it's become fashionable to be critical of the men and women of ice it's important to remember what this agency accomplishes every day for the American people in 2018 alone ICE agents and officers made more than 34000 criminal arrests of illegal immigrants in this country together removing 3635 gang members from our streets over 900 criminals affiliated with M.S. 13. You seize nearly 10000 pounds of opioids 2700 pounds of Fenton all and rescued more than 300 victims of human trafficking including 800 children who were victims of exploitation that is a record of remarkable success and the American people are grateful to the men and women of ice. And here in Georgia the Atlanta field offices frankly and sadly it is. It is one of the busiest offices in the country your Homeland Security investigations across the 3 state region you face the challenges that come with being in a city and being in a region that is a critical transit point in the life of this nation I don't have to tell any of the ICE agents gathered here that we have a crisis on our southern border but that crisis on our southern border is driving drugs and crime and human trafficking here in the streets of Atlanta you face it you confront it every day and you face it. Oftentimes without regard to your personal safety you can force our laws and you make the streets of Atlanta the streets of Georgia safer and you have our thanks it's remarkable to think that over the last 2 years without any additional personnel this Atlanta office actually removed nearly 14000 illegal immigrants from this country and I understand Sean the just yesterday in Riverdale Georgia this Atlanta office arrested a Mexican national who is the who is a subject of an Interpol red notice from Mexico on murder charges Atlanta and Georgia are safer today because of the outstanding work of the men and women of ice in Georgia. But not to be outdone Atlanta's Office of Homeland Security Investigations is truly remarkable record of success 5th in every category across the country of arrests indictments convictions and seizures 2 in the last year alone and I just learned this from Nick 2000 criminal arrests last year 7000 pounds of narcotics and in 2016 it was this office in cooperation with all the men and women in this room and some extraordinary law enforcement work at the state and local level homeland security investigation indicted over 40 individuals freed 50 young women exploited in what was the largest trafficking ring in ice history that is an extraordinary contribution to the safety and security of this state and of this nation and you have a. It's not just the 2 sticks it's the men and women of ice and I want you to know I've taken some time on my way down to reflect on some of the stories of each and every one of you Scott Sutton is Scott here in the in the room I hope he is Scott. Scott's a deportation officer in the team leader of Atlanta's special response team works alongside the U.S. attorney's office to prosecute criminal illegal aliens individuals who violated federal criminal law I'm told that earlier this month Scott led the effort in concert governor with Georgia State troopers to find and arrest an illegal alien or scrape from a detention facility on the previous night Scott Georgia is safer America is safer because you are doing your job with such great effectiveness thank you very much very much. Thank you. It's not just being it's not just being out front in law enforcement it's also it's also demonstrating the extraordinary compassion that each one of you shows enforcing the law and understanding that this crisis on our southern border is harming vulnerable populations on both sides of the border and I want to single out in particular I want to single out an agent of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement those with us here today I just I just met her a moment ago and I asked her how many languages she actually speaks she told me that she actually said Where is she now can you introduce you to me no illegal else Ellie Aliya also we were are you are you. Let's give all the round of applause. Thank you one of the one of the elements of the crisis on our southern borders that for the 1st time ever.

Now I know I know you've got a hard job and unfortunately with the debate in the in the public square today sometimes it gets harder heard on my way down here that the mayor of Atlanta. I recently announced that. At the city government wouldn't cooperate with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement when it comes to detention of of criminal illegal aliens in this city. And I I it is amazing to think the mayor actually said that she would her words not be complicit in an immigration policy that intentionally inflicts misery I would I would say to the mayor that. Criminal illegal immigrants gang members on our streets are what inflict misery the flow of illegal drugs like cocaine and meth and Fenton all inflict misery and wreck our families and communities human trafficking inflicts misery the Immigration and Customs Enforcement the men and women who enforce our laws do not inflict misery they bring safety and security to the people of Atlanta and they deserve the respect of every elected official in this country.

BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM , BOTH OF THEM SEEK TO HELP WITHOUT TERRITORIAL DESIGNS FOR EXPLOITATIVE GOALS . THE REST OF THE WORLD CAN'T UNDERSTAND . IT IS TRUE THAT GREAT THINGS HAPPEN THIS YEAR BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU I WAS THERE WHEN THE PRESIDENT VISITED THE HOTEL BEFORE THE DESIGNATION OF JERUSALEM AND I THINK BACK , IT WAS A BIGGER STEP BECAUSE HE CAME THERE AND TALK TO THE RABBI AND LEARNED ABOUT THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WESTERN WALL AND THEN HE PUT ON A SKULLCAP AND WALKED UP AND SAID READ FROM THE PSALMS AND SAID THIS IS A JEWISH ONLY PLACE . THE WESTERN WALL WHICH THE UNITED STATES THE UNITED NATIONS NOW DENIES US . AND THERE WASN'T ONE PROTEST IN THE ARAB OR MUSLIM WORLD BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO THE RIGHT THING, PEOPLE DON'T PROTEST. WHEN YOU STAND UP FOR PRINCIPLE AND YOU SHOW THEM YOU'RE NOT AFRAID AND YOU MAKE THAT KIND OF CLARION CALL, THE UNITED NATIONS AS YOU KNOW I WARNED YOU FOR YEARS ABOUT PROCESSING SAYING IT WOULD DENY OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN RIGHT TO VISIT THESE PLACES, I ASKED FOREIGN MINISTER'S , CHRISTIANS, HOW WILL YOU EXPLAIN THIS YOUR GRANDCHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE DENIED ACCESS BECAUSE THE UNITED NATIONS AND THESE ARE ONLY MUSLIM HOLY PLACES, 3800 YEARS OF JEWISH HISTORY, 2000 YEARS OF CHRISTIAN HISTORY OBLITERATED. AND TWO OF THEM SAID I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. I TOLD THEM IT'S TOO LATE . YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE. IT REMINDS US OF WHAT CHURCHILL TOLD CHAMBERLAIN, YOU HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN DISHONOR AND WAR . YOU CHOSE DISHONOR AND NOW YOU'LL HAVE MORE AREA AND A CHOSE DISHONOR IN THE UNITED NATIONS . I WARNED ABOUT IT EACH YEAR AS THE PROGRESSION TOOK PLACE WHERE THEY HYPHENATED THE NAME AND THEN ELIMINATED THE JUDEO-CHRISTIAN NAME OF THE TEMPLE MOUNT, THE WESTERN WALL, THE CAVE OF THE PATRIARCHS, RITUALS TO . ALL KNOWN FOR 3000 YEARS BY THE SAME NAMES . THEY OFTEN MOVED TO FALSIFY THE HISTORY OF OUR CONNECTION. YOU SAW THE WORDS WERE USED BY PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY OFFICIALS. THEY CALLED IT A WAR CRIME THAT AMERICAN OFFICIALS ATTENDED THE OPENING OF THE PILGRIMS WALKED . THEY CALLED IT THE PEACE NEGOTIATOR SAID IT'S A LIE. THERE IS NO SUCH CONNECTION . THE OTHERS SAID IT WAS FALSE, A MYTHICAL TUNNEL. THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO TWO WEEKS AGO UNVEILED A VILLAGE THAT CLAIMS TO PROVE THEIR ANCIENT ROOTS IN THE LAND EXCEPT THAT IT WAS FABRICATED. IT WASN'T REAL. AND HERE THE REAL HISTORY UNDENIABLE , IN THE STONES OF THAT WALK , THAT WHAT WE'RE 2.7 MILLION PEOPLE ON EVERY HOLIDAY WANT TO COME UP TO THE TEMPLE , RETURNING TO ITS PROPER PLACE . IT'S A SIGN THAT HISTORY IS TURNING . TIME WHEN JERUSALEM IS OPEN TO ALL FOR HIM TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE JUDAIZING OF JERUSALEM 300,000 YEARS AFTER KING DAVID MADE IT HIS CAPITAL, NOT TO HAVE HOTEL NAMED AFTER HIM IN JERUSALEM BUT BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZED ITS SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE , THE FULFILLMENT OF JEWISH DESTINY, OF THREE, FROM THE TIME OF ABRAHAM AND THE PROMISE OF ALL HISTORY, . THIS IS A WAR AGAINST THE JEWISH PEOPLE, JEWISH NATION, JEWISH PAST AND THE JEWISH FUTURE AND I BELIEVE YOURS AS WELL. SO I WANT TO MAKE A SPECIAL PLEA HERE TO ASK YOU AS I SAID JEWS MAY BE THE FIRST VICTIMS THAT WE'RE NEVER THE LAST, JEWISH HATRED IS CANCEROUS, IT METASTASIZES IN SOCIETY AND EVERYBODY EVENTUALLY GETS IN DANGER, EIGHT HAS NO GEOGRAPHIC OR LINGUISTIC OR POLITICAL BOUNDARIES. NO IDEOLOGICAL PATENT . IT CROSSES MOUNTAINS AND OCEANS, SPREADS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT SO NO MORE CROCODILE TEARS OVER JEWISH VICTIMS. NO MORE MEMORIALS TO JEWISH DAD. YOU WANT THE WORLD TO STAND UP FOR THE LIVING JEWISH PEOPLE AND IN LIVING VIBRANT JEWISH STATE NOW AND FOREVER. [APPLAUSE] AND NO MORE OUTRAGEOUS COMMENTS , EVEN BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS . WHO THEN FOLLOW WITH HALFHEARTED APOLOGY . ONLY TO BE REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN CAUSE THEY KNOW THAT YOU CANNOT RETRACT THE LIE , THE BIG LIE REMAINS. EVERYBODY FORGETS THE APOLOGY . NO MORE. YOU TOOK HITLER MONTHS TO SPREAD THE BIG LIE, IT'S NOW SPREAD IN SECONDS . WE HAVE TO STOP LETTING A SMALL GROUP OF EXTREMIST VOICES DOMINATE . WITH THEIR ILL-INFORMED AND BIASED COMMENTS . WE ALL HAVE TO STAND TOGETHER SO FROM THIS SACRED ASSEMBLY OF CARING AND MOTIVATED AND BLESSED PEOPLE , LET THE CLARION CALL GO FORTH . EIGHT STOPS NOW. NO EXCUSES, NO EXCEPTIONS, NONE. [APPLAUSE] THE ANTI-ISRAEL LIES STOP NOW. THE ATTEMPTS TO PICK AMERICA AGAINST ISRAEL STOP NOW. WE STAND TOGETHER . IN THIS BATTLE . THE ANTI-ISRAEL MOVEMENT ARE SHAMS. THAT REALLY COVERS FOR OTHER THINGS , BUT THEY CAN'T ADMIT WHAT THE REAL GOAL IS . SO ON CAMPUS AFTER CAMPUS , WE SEE THE DISTORTIONS TRANSLATED INTO COURSES , ONE OF COLUMBIA CALLED THE INVENTION OF THE JEW . THAT'S THE POISON FILLING THE MINDS OF THE NEXT GENERATION . THAT IS THE KIND OF MESSAGES THAT THEY ARE HEARING . SO THEN IT'S UP TO US . YOUR 7 BILLION AND US . I REMEMBER WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER OF CHINA VISITED ISRAEL AND PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU SAID BETWEEN US WE'RE BIGGER THAN A HALF-MILLION PEOPLE . I KNEW YOU GET IT EVENTUALLY. WE HAVE TO PUT ON CENTER STAGE THOSE WHO DESERVE RECOGNITION FOR THE COURAGEOUS STAND, OFTEN AT PERSONAL RISK . THOSE WHO SUSTAIN TRUE ACADEMIC FREEDOM, EVEN TRUE FREE SPEECH, WHO WANT TO SEE AMERICA FULFILL ITS DESTINY, VISION ASSURING THAT HATRED STOPS NOW . NO ONE IS IMMUNE AS THE WORDS OF PASTOR NINE MUELLER REMINDED US AND THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT WHEN THEY CAME FOR HIM. THERE ARE A PEOPLE WHO STAND UP BUT GET NO ATTENTION . SO NO MORE FOCUS ON THE BAD GUY , NEITHER IN CONGRESS OR IN GOVERNMENT CALLS OR IN ACADEMIA OR IN THE INTERNET OR IN ENTERTAINMENT. LET'S HIGHLIGHT THE HEROES LIKE PASTOR AND MRS. KATIE, THE PROFILES IN COURAGE TO STAND UP RESOLUTELY AGAINST THE PREVAILING CORRUPTED IDEAS AND CULTURAL APPROPRIATION . LIKE JK ROWLING, LIKE THE PRESIDENT OF WILLIAMS COLLEGE, CORNELL INJECTED THE BDS RESOLUTIONS, GOT PETITIONS AGAINST THEM MANNING LADY FIRED AND YET THEY WERE MORE RESOLUTE AND MORE RESOLUTE , DEMANDING TO STAND UP FOR THE TRUTH . WE WANT , [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD SALUTE THE GOVERNORS OF THE 26TH THAT HAVE ADOPTED ANTI-BDS LEGISLATIONS AND THEIR LEGISLATORS. LET THEM HEAR FROM YOU . LET THEM KNOW YOU APPRECIATE IT . IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM AS IT IS FOR ISRAEL. GOVERNOR CUOMO VISITED JUSTICE WE AND HE SAID IN ISRAEL THAT ISRAEL BUYS $5 BILLION IN GOODS FROM NEW YORK EVERY YEAR AND EXPORTS $8 MILLION. AND NEW YORK ONLY STANDS TO GAIN FROM IT. WE SHOULD SALUTE THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO LEFT THE LABOUR PARTY BECAUSE OF AN ANTI-SEMITISM AND ANTI-SEMITIC LEADERS . [APPLAUSE] WE SHOULD SALUTE THE CHRISTIAN ZIONISTS IN SOUTH AMERICA WHO ARE PRESSING THEIR GOVERNMENT TO RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM . I WAS THERE, I SAW THEM, AND WITH THEM . THEY ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH AND THE BEST PEOPLE YOU WILL MEET . WE SHOULD SALUTE THE "" OF HOLLAND . THE VAN OATS YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF , THE IMPORT HUNDRED 20,000 BOTTLES OF WINE INTO HOLLAND FOR DISTRIBUTION IN EUROPE AND WHO REFUSE TO PUT A LABEL AT THE EU HAS LEGISLATED ONTO THE ISRAELI PRODUCT BECAUSE THEY SAID IT IS BIGOTRY AND THEY WILL HAVE NO PART OF IT. [APPLAUSE] THE US AND ISRAEL WILL STAND TOGETHER I BELIEVE FOREVER. AND ESPECIALLY IN THE CHALLENGING YEARS AHEAD WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACROSS THE NATION AND ACROSS THE BOARD. YOU KNOW, LAST WEEK'S TORAH READING IT TELLS THE STORY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WENT TO SYNAGOGUE , YOU DIDN'T? IN THE PREVIOUS WEEKENDS FOR OUR READING IT SAID TELLS THE STORY OF THE SPICE AND THERE YOU KNOW THAT WHEN THEY CAME BACK, THEY SAID WE WERE LIKE GRASSHOPPERS IN THEIR EYES . IT DOESN'T SAY THAT THE GIANT SAID IT . THEY SAID IT. BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY PERCEIVE THEMSELVES . IT WAS ISN'T WHAT THE GIANT SAW . AND IT'S WHEN WE SEE OURSELVES AS GRASSHOPPERS, WE LOSE . WHEN WE SEE OURSELVES AS THE GIANTS, WE WIN . YOU STAND UP FOR THE RIGHT THING . NOW THE TIME, NO MORE GRASSHOPPERS. [APPLAUSE] AND IN THE STORY WHICH I HAVE TOLD HERE EVERY YEAR BUT REPEAT BECAUSE THERE'S ESPECIALLY TO PEOPLE HERE WHO ASKED ME TO , THEY'RE MY KIDS AND THEY HAVEN'T ASKED. YOU KNOW IN THE STORY OF THE SPIES , THE SCOUTS, YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SPIES IN WASHINGTON YOU SEE. YOU'LL HAVE A REPORT WRITTEN ABOUT YOU . HOW MANY OF YOU CAN NAME THE 10 CAME BACK WITH A NEGATIVE REPORT . HOW MANY OF YOU CAN NAME THE TWO CAME BACK WITH A POSITIVE REPORT ? THAT'S THE LESSON OF HISTORY, THOSE WHO STAND WITH ISRAEL ARE REMEMBERED FOREVER, THOSE WHO SPEAK AGAINST ISRAEL ARE LOST TO HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] ANGER AND FEAR DON'T SERVE US. WE MUST USE OUR ENERGIES TO CONSTRUCT WHILE THEY STRUCK. WE WILL DECIDE THE FUTURES , NOT LET OTHERS DETERMINE IT FOR US . NO MORE GRASSHOPPERS. HE MUST BUILD COALITIONS , REACH OUT TO FRIENDS, THEN , EMBOLDEN THEM . WE WILL BE THOSE WHO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, WE WILL ASSERT OUR LEGITIMACY, OUR RELEVANCE, OUR MEANINGFULNESS TO A YOUNGER GENERATION WHO ARE IN SEARCH . THEIR MINDS WILL BE FILLED WITH THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL FILL THEM. A RADICAL MEMBER OF CONGRESS? AN EXTREMIST PROFESSOR? OR THE BIBLICAL MESSAGE OR , THE TRADITIONAL MESSAGE. THE AGE OLD MESSAGE OF THE JUDEO-CHRISTIAN HERITAGE WHICH CAN PROVIDE ALL THE ANSWERS ONCE GIVEN TO THEM. YOUNG PEOPLE AS YOU KNOW TODAY ARE SUBJECT TO A LOT OF PRESSURES. BUT AT THE COUNTRY SONG GOES, WHEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN SOMETHING, YOU'LL FALL FOR ANYTHING . WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY BELIEVE IN SOMETHING. AND WE HAVE TO GIVE IT TO THEM IN THEIR TERMS AND IN THEIR MEDIUM WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO GO ON THE INTERNET, SOCIAL MEDIA AND COMMUNICATE THEM , EVEN THE WORDS DON'T MEAN THE SAME THINGS ANYMORE . THE POWER IN THIS ROOM , OF THIS MOVEMENT , OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GATHERED HERE , OF THIS ALLIANCE OF SUPPORT FOR US ISRAEL RELATIONSHIP CAN OVERCOME ALL THE OBSTACLES BY OUR WORKING TOGETHER AND LISTENING ALL WE CAN TO OUR COMMON EFFORT. WE WILL SEE THE FULFILLMENT OF THE BLESSING . GOD PROMISE WE HOLD, THAT WE SAY EVERY HANUKKAH IN THE BLESSING, WE THANK GOD FOR THE MIRACLES OF THOSE DAYS IN OUR TIME . THE MIRACLES OF THE FEW OVERCOMING THE MANY . THE RIGHTEOUS OVERCOMING THE EVIL. A FEW OVERCOMING , BUT PURE OVERCOMING IMPURE.THAT'S WHAT THIS ALLIANCE IS ABOUT . AND WE WILL SEE THOSE GLORIOUS DAYS WHEN THIS PROPHECY IS FULFILLED BY VIRTUE OF STANDING UP, SPEAKING OUT COURAGEOUSLY AND PROMISING NO MORE GRASSHOPPERS . [APPLAUSE] VICE PRESIDENT PENCE KNEW HE NEEDED TO GET BACK TO THE STATE AND COUNTRY THAT HAD GIVEN HIM SO MUCH. IN 2000 HE LAUNCHED A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS LOCAL CORRECTION CONGRESSIONAL SEAT, ENTERING THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AT THE AGE OF 40 . THE PEOPLE OF EAST CENTRAL INDIANA ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT PENCE SIX TIMES TO REPRESENT THEM IN CONGRESS. HIS COLLEAGUES QUICKLY RECOGNIZES LEADERSHIP ABILITY AND UNANIMOUSLY ELECTED HIM TO SERVE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE AND HOUSE REPUBLICANS CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN .

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE ENTERED OFFICE JANUARY 20 WHEN HE 17. IT IS MY HONOR TO WELCOME MY FRIEND VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE TO THE CU I SUMMIT FOR THE THIRD TIME. SINCE BEING ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT, HE HAS REMAINED FAITHFUL TO HIS VALUES OF HARD WORK, FAITH AND FAMILY AND UPHELD HIS FIRM BELIEF THAT STANDING WITH ISRAEL IS SIMPLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO . VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AS STOOD WITH CUIS FOR MANY YEARS AS WE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO ENSURE A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL REMAINS CLOSE AND INSEPARABLE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WILL YOU PLEASE DAN AND GET A WARM WELCOME TO A CONSISTENT AND FAITHFUL FRIEND , THE 45TH VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MIKE PENCE . [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] HELLO CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL . THANK YOU FOR THAT WARM WELCOME . WELCOME BACK TO OUR NATION'S CAPITAL FOR THIS WASHINGTON SUMMIT . IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO BE WITH YOU ALL AND WITH I KNOW MILLIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT ARE LOOKING ON. PASTOR JOHN HAGAN, MY THANKS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR MINISTRY.IT HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR AMERICA AND FOR ISRAEL. TO MY FRIEND GARY BAUER WHO RUNS THE WASHINGTON OFFICE FOR CUFI, TO THE THOUSANDS OF PRO-ISRAEL AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN GATHERED HERE AND ALL THOSE LOOKING ON, HENCE THE FOUNDING OF THIS NATION , THE FOUNDING THAT WE JUST CELEBRATED A FEW SHORT DAYS AGO , THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAVE BEEN AT THE VERY HEART OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . AND ALL OF YOU GATHERED HERE IN THE 6 MILLION THAT YOU REPRESENT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY CONTINUE THIS GREAT TRADITION WITH CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL, THE LARGEST PRO-ISRAEL GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR YOUR STAND . THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING GREAT AMERICAN TRADITION. IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH SO MANY FRIENDS OF ISRAEL FROM ACROSS THIS NATION . AND SPEAKING OF FRIENDS OF ISRAEL, ALLOW ME TO BEGIN TODAY BY BRINGING GREETINGS FROM A FRIEND OF MINE . AND A MAN HISTORY HAS ALREADY PROVEN TO BE THE GREATEST FRIEND OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE AND THE STATE OF ISRAEL EVER TO SIT IN THE OVAL OFFICE , I BRING GREETINGS FROM THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , RESIDENT DONALD TRUMP . PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL ALWAYS DAN IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR JEWISH MOTHERS AND SISTERS AND WE WILL ALWAYS DAN STRONG FOR THE STATE OF ISRAEL. YOU KNOW, I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW THIS PRESIDENT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS AND WE SERVED TOGETHER SINCE HE ASKED ME TO JOIN THIS STATE AND I TELL YOU, HE'S A MAN OF ACTION . AND HE'S A MAN OF HIS WORD. HE SAYS WHAT HE MEANS AND HE MEANS WHAT HE SAYS AND FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN KEEPING THE PROMISES THAT HE MADE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . AT HOME AND ABROAD . [APPLAUSE] IS TRUE, THINK ABOUT IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID WE WILL REVIVE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS. WE CUT BACK TAXES, ROLLBACK REGULATION, UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY AND SINCE ELECTION DAY BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL HAVE CREATED MORE THAN 6 MILLION NEW JOBS INCLUDING MORE THAN A QUARTER OF 1 MILLION JOBS IN THE LAST MONTH ALONE . [APPLAUSE] WAGES ARE UP . THE STOCK MARKET IS SOARING AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IS NEAR A 50 YEAR LOW AND THIS PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD REBUILD OUR MILITARY AND RESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS ALREADY SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASE IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN . WE'VE MADE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE . JOBS ARE BACK . CONFIDENCE IS BACK . IN A WORD, AMERICA IS BACK AND WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED . I'M PROUD TO REPORT WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, THE UNITED STATES IS ONCE AGAIN EMBRACING OUR ROLE AS LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD . PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA. HE STANDS UP FOR AMERICA EVERY DAY ON THE WORLD STAGE. [APPLAUSE] AND UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, WE ARE STANDING WITH OUR ALLIES AND STANDING UP TO OUR ENEMIES . OUR NATO ALLIES ARE CONTRIBUTING MORE THAN EVER BEFORE TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE AND WE'VE TAKEN THE FIGHT TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ON OUR TERMS ON THEIR SOIL . FIVE YEARS AGO , ISIS CONTROLLED NEARLY 85,000 SQUARE MILES IN SYRIA AND IRAQ AND NEARLY 5 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE UNDER THEIR BRUTAL REGIME . TODAY, THANKS TO OUR ARMED FORCES , OUR PARTNERS IN THE REGION AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF , EARLIER THIS YEAR THE LAST INCH OF GROUND CONTROLLED BY ISIS IN SYRIA WAS CAPTURED . THE ISIS CALIPHATE IS NO MORE. [APPLAUSE] AND FINALLY, UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AS THE WORLD KNOWS NOTHING ELSE, THE WORLD KNOWS THIS : AMERICA STANDS WITH ISRAEL . [APPLAUSE] THANKS TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, OUR ALLIANCE HAS LITERALLY NEVER BEEN STRONGER. [INAUDIBLE] [CHEERING] WELCOME BACK TO WASHINGTON DC . YOU KNOW, THANKS TO THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP IT'S TRUE. OUR ALLIANCE WITH ISRAEL HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER. IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET ISAIAH , FOR THE SAKE OF ZION I WILL NOT BE SILENT . IT WAS WRITTEN AND MY FRIENDS, THIS PRESIDENT FOR THE SAKE OF ZION HAS NOT BEEN SILENCED . [APPLAUSE] I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED ISRAEL WOULD HAVE THE RESOURCES AND TOOLS TO DEFEND ITSELF BY ITSELF . UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR THE SECURITY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER IN THE MILITARY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. RESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED TO SHUT DOWN THE PLO OFFICE IN WASHINGTON OF THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY REFUSED TO TAKE STEPS TO STOP FUNDING TERRORISTS WHO MURDERED INNOCENT ISRAELI CIVILIANS WITH AMERICAN TAX DOLLARS AND WHEN THE PLO REFUSED, PRESIDENT TRUMP SHUT DOWN THEIR OFFICE. NOW THE FACT IS THE LAW OF THE LAND. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT ALSO PROMISED TO CONFRONT ANTI-SEMITISM ON THE WORLD STAGE . AND SEE TO IT THAT AMERICA WOULD NO LONGER ALLOW THE UNITED NATIONS TO BE A FORUM FOR INVECTIVE AGAINST ISRAEL AND LAST SUMMER, THIS PRESIDENT WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE SO-CALLED HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL AT THE UN AND TWO MONTHS LATER PRESIDENT TRUMP ENDED ALL US CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNRAH . AND OF COURSE LAST YEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP DID WHAT NO AMERICAN PRESIDENT BEFORE HIM HAD THE COURAGE TO DO . WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING TO THINK I WAS THERE WHEN THAT DECISION WAS BEING MADE AND BEING PROCESSED AND TO SAY THAT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD OPPOSED THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND TO MOVE OUR EMBASSY THERE, TO SAY EVERYONE IN THE WORLD WAS AGAINST IT WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A MAN OF HIS WORD AND HE KEPT HIS WORD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . WHEN HE RECOGNIZED JERUSALEM IS THE ETERNAL CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND MOVED OUT EMBASSY THERE. [APPLAUSE] AND BEYOND THAT FOR 20 YEARS AFTER ISRAEL'S REVERT, SYRIA HELD STRATEGIC GROUND KNOWN AS THE GOLAN HEIGHTS WITH ITS MASSIVE ARTILLERY IT HELD ISRAEL HOSTAGE . THIS CRUCIAL REGION CHANGE CAN ONLY AFTER ISRAEL WON A WAR FORCED UPON HER . EVER SINCE THEN THE GOAL ON HEIGHTS HAVE BEEN CRITICAL TO THE STRATEGIC SECURITY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL . BUT IN ONE ADMINISTRATION AFTER ANOTHER , AMERICA HESITATED TO RECOGNIZE THAT BECAUSE OF ITS IMPORTANCE AND BECAUSE OF OUR COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL , EARLIER THIS YEAR THE FIRST TIME IN 52 YEARS, PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU AT HIS SIDE I HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA NORMALLY RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. [APPLAUSE] OUR PRESIDENT MADE ALL THESE DECISIONS , KEEPING HIS WORD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE MADE THEM IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR NATION , BUT I WANT TO ASSURE ALL OF YOU HERE THAT THIS PRESIDENT ALSO BELIEVE THEY WERE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PEACE . BECAUSE A LASTING PEACE CAN ONLY BE BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF TRUTH . SO WE PRAY FOR THE PEACE OF JERUSALEM. THAT THOSE WHO LOVE HER WILL BE SECURE. AND EVEN AS WE PRAY, WE WILL WORK FOR PEACE . PRESIDENT TRUMP IS COMMITTED TO FINDING A PATH THAT CAN LEAD TO A TRUE, JUST AND LASTING PEACE FOR ISRAEL, PALESTINIANS AND ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE REGION. FOR PEACE TO BE LASTING AND TO THE REAL MUST BE NEGOTIATED . BUT PEACE CAN ONLY BE NEGOTIATED WITH PARTNERS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO PEACE. HAMAS IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION THAT SEEKS THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES WILL NEVER NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS HAMAS. [APPLAUSE] BUT LAST WEEK IN PURSUIT OF PEACE THERE WAS A HISTORIC CONFERENCE IN BAHRAIN . AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF PAINSTAKING EFFORTS, THE PRESIDENT'S EXTRAORDINARY MIDDLE EAST PEACE TEAM LED BY JARED KUSHNER UNVEILED A NEW VISION OF HOW THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE COULD BE EMPOWERED TO BUILD A PROSPEROUS VIBRANT AND PEACEFUL SOCIETY IF THEY CHOOSE PEACE OVER WAR. I KNOW THE CYNICS OUT THERE SAY THE PRESIDENT STREAMS OR PEACE ARE TWO BIG . IT IS ALSO TOO HIGH BUT IT WAS NONE OTHER THAN DAVID THEN GARY ON , ISRAEL'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER WHO SAID AND I QUOTE , ANYONE WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN MIRACLES AROUND THESE PARTS ISN'T A REALIST . SO WE WILL KEEP DREAMING AND KEEP WORKING FOR PEACE. [APPLAUSE] AND LET ME ASSURE YOU , WHILE ANY PIECE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY REQUIRE COMPROMISE, YOU CAN BE CONFIDENT OF THIS . THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL NEVER COMPROMISE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL . IN THE WAKE OF ALL THOSE ACTIONS FINALLY THE PRESIDENT ALSO MADE ONE OTHER PROMISE . HE PROMISED TO STAND UP TO THE WORLD'S LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR . AND HE DID JUST THAT. WHEN HE WITHDREW THE UNITED STATE OF AMERICA FROM THE DISASTROUS AROUND NUCLEAR DEAL. THERE WILL BE NO MORE CASH FOR THE MULLAHS IN IRAN.AND PROFESSOR HAGAN MENTIONED I SERVED IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, I WAS ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. BACK WHEN I WAS IN CONGRESS WAS A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO BROUGHT TOGETHER SANCTIONS ON IRAN YEARS AGO . THOSE SANCTIONS WERE ISOLATING REGIME WAS IN BRINGING TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON IT. BUT IN 2015, WE ALL REMEMBER WE THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL WAS SIGNED , ALL OF THAT PRESSURE WENT AWAY. THE PREVIOUS AND MINISTRATIONS OPEL DEAL DIDN'T PREVENT IRAN FROM OBTAINING A NUCLEAR WEAPON, IT DELAYED IT. FOR ROUGHLY A DECADE. IN EXCHANGE, THE DEAL GAVE AWAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CASH SANCTIONS REALLY IRAN HAS USED THE PHONE MORE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON INNOCENCE ACROSS THE REGION. PRESIDENT TRUMP WITHDREW FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND WE HAVE REIMPOSED EVERY LAST SECTION THAT WAS LIFTED. AND UNDER THIS PRESIDENT, WE IMPLEMENTED A MAXIMUM CAMPAIGN TO CHANGE BRANDS MORE LINE BEHAVIOR AND HOLD THE REGIME ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS. IT'S REMARKABLE TO THINK AS WE SEE , OUR ACTIONS ARE ALREADY HAVING AN EFFECT . THEY'RE CUTTING OFF THE REGIME'S ABILITY TO SUPPORT THEIR TERRORIST MINIONS ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST . THE IRANIAN ECONOMY IS REELING UNDER UNPRECEDENTED US SANCTIONS. NOW AARON MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN CARING FOR HIS PEOPLE AND CONTINUING TO FUND ITS PROXIES WHO SPREAD VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND BREATHE OUT MURDEROUS HATRED AGAINST ISRAEL. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS, DESPITE PROMISES"" TO THE CONTRARY IN 2015 , IRAN HAS BEEN EVEN INCREASING MORE OF THEIR MALIGN ACTIVITY AND VIOLENCE IN THE REGION AND WE'VE ALL WITNESSED IT. LAST MONTH AROUND ATTACK TANKERS PASSING NEAR THE STRAIT OF LOSE AND THEY DOWN AN UNMANNED AMERICAN DRONE. AND LAST WEEK AROUND EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT OF LOW ENRICHED AND RADIANT IN HALF. TODAY IT ACTUALLY PROCLAIMED IT WAS GOING TO START ENRICHING URANIUM BEYOND THE LEVELS PERMITTED BY THE AGREEMENT. SO LET ME BE CLEAR. IRAN SHOULD NOT CONFUSE AMERICAN RESTRAINT WITH A LACK OF AMERICAN RESOLVE . [APPLAUSE] WE HOPE FOR THE BEST , BUT THE UNITED STATES AND OUR MILITARY ARE PREPARED . TO PROTECT OUR INTERESTS AND PROTECT OUR PERSONNEL AND OUR CITIZENS IN THE REGION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE IRAN'S MALIGN INFLUENCE . WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING PRESSURE ON THEIR ECONOMY AND OTHER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, AMERICA WILL NEVER ALLOW IRAN TO OBTAIN A NUCLEAR WEAPON . HISTORY TEACHES THAT WHEN AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES BREATHE OUT VIOLENT ANTI-SOMATIC HATRED , AND THREATS OF VIOLENCE, THAT WE SHOULD TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD. EARLIER THIS YEAR, MY WIFE KAREN AND I STOOD AND PRAYED AND GRIEVED AT THE AUSCHWITZ BIRKENAU NOT THE DEATH CAMP . IT WAS AN INDESCRIBABLE EXPERIENCE . TO WALK THOSE IMMENSE ROUNDS. KILLING ON AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE. AS WE GAZED DOWN AT THE REMAINS OF THE GAS CHAMBERS, AS WE WALKED PAST THE PERSONAL EFFECTS , THE PILES OF LITTLE SHOES THAT WERE GATHERED THERE. , IT MERELY REINFORCED OUR RESOLVE . THAT ANSWER TO THAT UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY THROUGH THIS AND EVERY GENERATION MUST BE NEVER AGAIN. NEVER AGAIN. NEVER AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] ISRAEL WAS REBORN THAT WAS ALL , SO WE MUST AS AMERICANS MAINTAIN IT. WE CAN NEVER ALLOW THE MEMORY OF THOSE LOSSES IN THE HOLOCAUST TO BE FORGOTTEN BY FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD . WE MUST TEACH OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED. WE MUST PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF THOSE LOST FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS . AND IN THAT SAME SPIRIT, WE MUST NEVER ALLOW THE MEMORY OF THOSE LOST IN THE HOLOCAUST TO BE CHEAPENED AS A CLICHC TO ADVANCE SOME LEFT-WING POLITICAL NARRATIVE . [APPLAUSE] BUT SADLY, SADLY IN RECENT WEEKS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SOME DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE IN THE NATIONAL DEBATE . LAST MONTH A LEADING DEMOCRAT IN CONGRESS COMPARED OUR US CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION FACILITIES TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS . OUR ALLIES IN CONGRESS , THE LEFT AND THE MEDIA SHAMEFULLY CAME TO HER DEFENSE . AS RECENTLY AS YESTERDAY MORNING ONE OF OUR ALLIES IN CONGRESS WAS ASKED IF THEY AGREED WITH COMPARING THE NOBLE AND COMPASSIONATE WORK DONE BY US CUSTOMS AND BORDER PERSONNEL DETENTION FACILITIES TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS OF NAZI GERMANY AND SHE ANSWERED ABSOLUTELY. TO COMPARE THE HUMANE WORK OF THE DEDICATED MEN AND WOMEN OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION WITH THE HORRORS OF THE HOLOCAUST IS AN OUTRAGE. THE NAZIS TOOK LIVES , AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT SAVE LIVES EVERY DAY. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. THIS SLANDERED LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS AN INSULT TO THE 6 MILLION KILLED IN THE HOLOCAUST. AND IT SHOULD BE CONDEMNED BY EVERY AMERICAN OF EVERY POLITICAL PARTY EVERYWHERE. I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND I WILL ALWAYS HONOR THE MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST AND WE WILL ALWAYS HONOR THE SERVICE OF THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT , ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] THE TRUTH IS AS I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY, WE HAVE A CRISIS IN OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. WE ARE ACTUALLY ON TRACK THIS YEAR TO SEE NEARLY 1 MILLION PEOPLE, ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER . TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WELL ADVERTISED LOOPHOLES IN AMERICA'S ASYLUM LAWS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, I'VE SEEN IT FIRSTHAND. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE COMING ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER OUR FAMILIES. WITH VULNERABLE CHILDREN. ARE BEING ENTICED BY HUMAN TRAFFICKERS AND DRUG CARTELS TO PAY CASH TO MAKE THE LONG AND DANGEROUS JOURNEY NORTH . AND IT'S A DANGEROUS JOURNEY. FRAUGHT OFTEN WITH UNSPEAKABLE VIOLENCE AND ABUSE . 70 PERCENT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ONCE THEY PRESENT AT THE BORDER REPORT BEING VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ALONG THE WAY. ACCORDING TO DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS, NEARLY ONE THIRD OF YOUNG WOMEN TRAVELING TO OUR SOUTHERN BORDER FROM CENTRAL AMERICA ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ON THE JOURNEY . OUR CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PERSONNEL DO COMPASSIONATE WORK TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MADE A DANGEROUS JOURNEY AND THEY PROVIDE THAT COMPASSIONATE SUPPORT EVERY DAY . UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN ACROSS OUR BORDER ARE PROVIDED WITH FOOD, EDUCATION, CARE AND TRANSPORTATION TO THEIR DESTINATION CITY ALL TAXPAYER EXPENSE. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORKS TO PLACE THESE CHILDREN WITH FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE UNITED STATES OR ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS LIKE FOSTER CARE. FAMILY UNITS WHO ARE KEPT IN ICE CUSTODY ARE SENT TO FAMILY RESIDENTIAL SECTORS WHERE THEY CAN RECEIVE SHELTER AND CARE. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, THE FACILITIES ON OUR BORDER ARE OVERCROWDED. BECAUSE THEY'RE OVERWHELMED . SO THE LAST SIX MONTHS, DEMOCRATS DENIED THERE WAS EVEN A CRISIS ON OUR BORDER. THEY CALLED IT A MANUFACTURED CRISIS, REMEMBER THAT? AND IN SO DOING THEY DENY ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO CARE FOR THE VULNERABLE FAMILIES GOING ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER AND AS I STAND HERE TODAY THEY CONTINUE TO REFUSE TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES USED BY HUMAN TRAFFICKERS . TO EXPLOIT THOSE VULNERABLE FAMILIES. IN THE FACE OF THIS DEMOCRATIC OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS PRESIDENT FROM GOOD STRONG. HE DEMANDED THAT MEXICO AND NOW MEXICO IS DOING MORE THAN EVER BEFORE TO SECURE THEIR SOUTHERN BORDER AND OURS . [APPLAUSE] AND JUST LAST WEEK PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED INTO LAW A BIPARTISAN MEASURE PROVIDING 4.6 ALIEN DOLLARS IN HUMANITARIAN AID TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF HHS AND CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION . BUT YOU ALL DESERVE TO KNOW THE SAME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAD THE GALL TO COMPARE OUR DETENTION FACILITIES TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS VOTED AGAINST PROVIDING ADDITIONAL HUMANITARIAN AID TO THE SAME FACILITIES THEY DENOUNCED . IN THE FACE OF THAT TYPE OF DEMOCRATIC OBSTRUCTION I'LL MAKE YOU A PROMISE . UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, WE WILL SECURE OUR BORDERS. WE WILL PROVIDE COMPASSIONATE RELIEF TO VULNERABLE FAMILIES SWEPT UP IN THE CRISIS AND WE WILL FIX THIS BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM ONCE AND FOR ALL. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL WE'VE REACHED A DECISIVE MOMENT IN HISTORY . SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL AND THE JEWISH PEOPLE I BELIEVE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. ALL OVER THE WORLD ANTI-SEMITISM IS ON THE RISE . WE SEE IT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES , IN THE MARKETPLACE AND SADLY EVEN IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS . YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME THAT SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL WAS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE HERE IN WASHINGTON . I'LL NEVER FORGET THE DAY IN 2007 THAT I , A CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN REPUBLICAN WAS ASKED TO COFOUND THE CONGRESSIONAL ANTI-SEMITISM TASK FORCE WITH THE ONLY HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR EVER TO SERVE IN CONGRESS , THE LAKE AND GREAT CONGRESSMAN TOM LAND HOUSE . [APPLAUSE] WE FORMED THAT TASK FORCE BECAUSE OF THE BROAD CONSENSUS THAT EXISTED IN THE CONGRESS THAT SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL IS SUPPORT FOR THE JEWISH PEOPLE BUT HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED . IT'S ASTONISHING TO THINK THAT THE PARTY OF HARRY TRUMAN WHICH DID SO MUCH TO HELP CREATE THE STATE OF ISRAEL HAD BEEN CO-OPTED BY PEOPLE WHO PROMOTE RACK ANTI-SEMITIC RHETORIC. AND WORK TO UNDERMINE THE BROAD AMERICAN CONSENSUS OF SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL. RECENTLY A FRESHMAN DEMOCRAT IN CONGRESS TRAFFIC AND REPEATED ANTI-SEMITIC TROPES . WE ALL REMEMBER THEM. SHE ALLEGED THAT CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL REFLECTED A ALLEGIANCE TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY. SHE SAID THAT ISRAEL HAD AND I QUOTE, HYPNOTIZE THE WORLD. LET ME SAY THIS FROM THE HEART. ANTI-SEMITISM HAS NO PLACE IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THIS NATION. AND ANYONE WHO SLANDERS THE HISTORIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL SHOULD NOT BE SITTING ON A FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. [APPLAUSE] MAYBE MOST ASTONISHING OF ALL AS WE TALK ABOUT HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED , THE PARTY THAT HAS BEEN HOME TO SO MANY AMERICAN JEWS WERE SO LONG, RECENTLY EVEN MUSTER THE VOTES TO UNEQUIVOCALLY CONDEMN ANTI-SEMITISM IN OUR RESOLUTION. THAT'S WHY THE WORK OF CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. UNFORTUNATELY, CUFI IS BIGGER AND MORE EFFECTIVE THAN EVER BEFORE. YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER WHEN CHRISTIANS UNITED WAS A GROUP OF A FEW HUNDRED BIBLE BELIEVING CHRISTIANS . LAST TIME I SPOKE TO YOU, THIS ORGANIZATION HAD GROWN TO MORE THAN 3 MILLION BELIEVERS . AND ON MY WAY OVER I WAS JUST TOLD CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL NOW HAS MORE THAN 6 MILLION MEMBERS. ALL ACROSS AMERICA. KAREN AND I HAVE SHE SAID 7 MILLION. IS A MOVEMENT THAT SPANS THIS NATION AND THE MOVEMENTS FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS. [APPLAUSE] KERRY AND I HAVE ALWAYS TREASURED OUR RELATIONSHIPS AT CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL. WE WORK HAND-IN-HAND WITH THIS ORGANIZATION WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF INDIANA . WITH YOUR STRONG SUPPORT I WAS PROUD TO SIGN THE TOUGHEST ANTI-BDS LEGISLATION OF ANY STATE IN AMERICA AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. BUT YOU DESERVE TO KNOW , REMARKABLY TODAY ALL BUT ONE DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT VOTED AGAINST COMBATING BDS ACTS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. SO LET ME GET THIS ONE MORE POINT. ANYONE WHO ASPIRES TO THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO STAND WITH ISRAEL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES WILL ALWAYS STAND TOGETHER . BECAUSE AMERICA AND ISRAEL ARE MORE THAN FRIENDS . WE ARE MORE THAN ALLIES. THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL OUR FAMILY. DESCENDED FROM A COMMON TRADITION OF FAITH, WE'RE A FAMILY THAT UPHOLDS COMMON VALUES AND TOGETHER WE SHARE A COMMON DESTINY. YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH THIS YEAR, THAT BOND CAME INTO HIGH RELIEF. IN THE FACES OF TWO EXTRAORDINARY MEN , THE PRESIDENT INTRODUCED TO THE NATION. ONE WAS A JEWISH AMERICAN HERO, SERGEANT AND LIKE IT, A VETERAN OF THE DAY AND THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE . TRULY A GREAT AMERICAN OF THE GREATEST GENERATION. YOU KNOW, LAST MONTH MARKED THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY AND WE WILL NEVER FAIL TO HONOR THAT HEROISM OF THOSE WHO SERVED IN THE GREATEST WAR. [APPLAUSE] BUT IF YOU REMEMBER, SITTING BESIDE SERGEANT CITED WAS JOSHUA KAUFMAN. SURVIVOR OF DACHAU. A REAL CONCENTRATION CAMP. SERGEANT DESIGNED TO HELP LIBERATE A YEAR AFTER D-DAY. THESE TWO MEN , MORE THAN SEVEN DECADES LATER WERE REUNITED THAT NIGHT. UNITED NOT JUST IN THEIR STORIES BUT IN OUR HISTORY , IN OUR CAUSE. OF FREEDOM AND JUSTICE. 75 YEARS LATER, WITHOUT A DRY EYE IN THE HOUSE , THEY STOOD TOGETHER IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES . AND IN THAT RELATIONSHIP, CULTURE AND UNBREAKABLE BOND . TO AMERICA AND ISRAEL. THE BOND THAT BRINGS YOU ALL HERE TODAY. IT WAS ULTIMATELY A BOND OF FAITH . I'M TOLD BEFORE THEY LEFT THE CAPITAL THAT THE PSYCHIC FAMILY AND KAUFMAN FAMILY MET FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND HERMAN AND HIS BIBLE WITH HIM. THE BIBLE THAT HE HAD WHEN HE WAS IN SERVICE IN THE ARMY. THEY OPENED TOGETHER . AND THEY SAID PRAISE TO THE FAITHFUL GOD. [APPLAUSE] THAT BOND ENDURED THE HORRORS OF WAR , ENDURED THROUGH THE DECADES AND IT ALWAYS WILL. SO WHY ISRAEL? WE STAND WITH ISRAEL TODAY FOR THE SAME REASON AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS STOOD WITH ISRAEL . TODAY AND EVERYDAY, WE BEAR WITNESS TO GOD FAITHFULNESS. AS WELL AS THEIR OWN. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS MARVELED THROUGH NEARLY 1900 YEARS OF EXILE, THE LONGEST EXILE OF ANY PEOPLE IN HISTORY, THE JEWISH PEOPLE DREW STRENGTH FROM THE PROMISES OF GOD THROUGH PILGRIMS, PERSECUTION AND EXPULSIONS IN THE GHETTOS AND FINALLY EVEN IN THE DEATH CAMPS, THE JEWISH PEOPLE CLUNG TO GODS ETERNAL PROMISE. AND THEY REMEMBERED, EVEN IF YOU'VE BEEN BANISHED TO THE MOST DISTANT LAND UNDER THE HEAVENS, FROM THERE HE WOULD GATHER THEM AND BRING THEM BACK TO THE LAND WHICH THEIR FATHER POSSESSED. AND SO WE DID. [APPLAUSE] AND AMERICA WAS THERE. AMERICA WAS STANDING WITH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. AMAZING TO THINK EVEN IN THOSE DARKEST OF TIMES, HE HEARD FROM HEAVEN, HIS HOLY DWELLING PLACE, AND THEY HAD FAILED. FIELD. SO IT'S ON THE BASIS I CLOSE TODAY AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A FULL PROGRAM AHEAD OF YOU. YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM OTHER FRIENDS OF ISRAEL THROUGHOUT THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HERE AND LET ME JUST SAY BEFORE I CLOSE ON BEHALF OF MY WIFE KAREN AND OUR WHOLE FAMILY, THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT. IT IS THE GREATEST , [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S HUMBLING TO BE WITH YOU TODAY, AND I LEAVE HERE ENCOURAGED. I I CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO LUNCH TO TELL THEM THAT I SAW YOU. AND I WANT TO CLOSE, I WANT TO CLOSE WITH FAITH. FAITH AND GOOD PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND AMERICA, AND IN THE IMMUTABLE BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP THAT BIND US TODAY AND ALWAYS WILL FAITH IN THE IDEALS AND THE PRINCIPLES OF BOTH AMERICA AND ISRAEL HOLD DEAR. A COMMITMENT TO LIBERTY AND FREEDOM, AND THE NOTION THAT WE ARE ENDOWED BY OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS. AND FINALLY, FAITH THAT IS EVER ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER FROM OUR NATIONS FOUNDING, PEOPLE DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND RELIGIOUS BELIEF, THE FAITH THAT BINDS THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TOGETHER. THAT HE WHO WATCHES OVER US WILL NEVER LEAVE US NOR FORSAKE US HERE HE WILL GUIDE US AND HE WILL SURELY BLESS US. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. MAY GOD BLESS ISRAEL. [APPLAUSE] AND MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WAS SPEAKING OF THE CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON, D.C. LATER, SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO AND NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON WILL ALSO BE SPEAKING AT THE EVENT. YOU CAN WATCH THEIR REMARKS LIVE AT 1 P.M. EASTERN ON C-SPAN."

WE'VE MADE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE . JOBS ARE BACK . CONFIDENCE IS BACK . IN A WORD, AMERICA IS BACK AND WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED . I'M PROUD TO REPORT WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, THE UNITED STATES IS ONCE AGAIN EMBRACING OUR ROLE AS LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD . PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA. HE STANDS UP FOR AMERICA EVERY DAY ON THE WORLD STAGE. AND UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, WE ARE STANDING WITH OUR ALLIES AND STANDING UP TO OUR ENEMIES . OUR NATO ALLIES ARE CONTRIBUTING MORE THAN EVER BEFORE TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE AND WE'VE TAKEN THE FIGHT TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ON OUR TERMS ON THEIR SOIL . FIVE YEARS AGO , ISIS CONTROLLED NEARLY 85,000 SQUARE MILES IN SYRIA AND IRAQ AND NEARLY 5 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE UNDER THEIR BRUTAL REGIME . TODAY, THANKS TO OUR ARMED FORCES , OUR PARTNERS IN THE REGION AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF , EARLIER THIS YEAR THE LAST INCH OF GROUND CONTROLLED BY ISIS IN SYRIA WAS CAPTURED . THE ISIS CALIPHATE IS NO MORE. AND FINALLY, UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AS THE WORLD KNOWS NOTHING ELSE, THE WORLD KNOWS THIS : AMERICA STANDS WITH ISRAEL . THANKS TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, OUR ALLIANCE HAS LITERALLY NEVER BEEN STRONGER. WELCOME BACK TO WASHINGTON DC . YOU KNOW, THANKS TO THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP IT'S TRUE. OUR ALLIANCE WITH ISRAEL HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER. IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET ISAIAH , FOR THE SAKE OF ZION I WILL NOT BE SILENT . IT WAS WRITTEN AND MY FRIENDS, THIS PRESIDENT FOR THE SAKE OF ZION HAS NOT BEEN SILENCED . I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED ISRAEL WOULD HAVE THE RESOURCES AND TOOLS TO DEFEND ITSELF BY ITSELF . UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR THE SECURITY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER IN THE MILITARY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. RESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED TO SHUT DOWN THE PLO OFFICE IN WASHINGTON OF THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY REFUSED TO TAKE STEPS TO STOP FUNDING TERRORISTS WHO MURDERED INNOCENT ISRAELI CIVILIANS WITH AMERICAN TAX DOLLARS AND WHEN THE PLO REFUSED, PRESIDENT TRUMP SHUT DOWN THEIR OFFICE. NOW THE FACT IS THE LAW OF THE LAND. PRESIDENT ALSO PROMISED TO CONFRONT ANTI-SEMITISM ON THE WORLD STAGE . AND SEE TO IT THAT AMERICA WOULD NO LONGER ALLOW THE UNITED NATIONS TO BE A FORUM FOR INVECTIVE AGAINST ISRAEL AND LAST SUMMER, THIS PRESIDENT WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE SO-CALLED HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL AT THE UN AND TWO MONTHS LATER PRESIDENT TRUMP ENDED ALL US CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNRAH . AND OF COURSE LAST YEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP DID WHAT NO AMERICAN PRESIDENT BEFORE HIM HAD THE COURAGE TO DO . WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM. YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING TO THINK I WAS THERE WHEN THAT DECISION WAS BEING MADE AND BEING PROCESSED AND TO SAY THAT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD OPPOSED THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND TO MOVE OUR EMBASSY THERE, TO SAY EVERYONE IN THE WORLD WAS AGAINST IT WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A MAN OF HIS WORD AND HE KEPT HIS WORD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . WHEN HE RECOGNIZED JERUSALEM IS THE ETERNAL CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND MOVED OUT EMBASSY THERE. AND BEYOND THAT FOR 20 YEARS AFTER ISRAEL'S REVERT, SYRIA HELD STRATEGIC GROUND KNOWN AS THE GOLAN HEIGHTS WITH ITS MASSIVE ARTILLERY IT HELD ISRAEL HOSTAGE . THIS CRUCIAL REGION CHANGE CAN ONLY AFTER ISRAEL WON A WAR FORCED UPON HER . EVER SINCE THEN THE GOAL ON HEIGHTS HAVE BEEN CRITICAL TO THE STRATEGIC SECURITY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL . BUT IN ONE ADMINISTRATION AFTER ANOTHER , AMERICA HESITATED TO RECOGNIZE THAT BECAUSE OF ITS IMPORTANCE AND BECAUSE OF OUR COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL , EARLIER THIS YEAR THE FIRST TIME IN 52 YEARS, PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU AT HIS SIDE I HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA NORMALLY RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. OUR PRESIDENT MADE ALL THESE DECISIONS , KEEPING HIS WORD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE MADE THEM IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR NATION , BUT I WANT TO ASSURE ALL OF YOU HERE THAT THIS PRESIDENT ALSO BELIEVE THEY WERE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PEACE . BECAUSE A LASTING PEACE CAN ONLY BE BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF TRUTH . SO WE PRAY FOR THE PEACE OF JERUSALEM. THAT THOSE WHO LOVE HER WILL BE SECURE. AND EVEN AS WE PRAY, WE WILL WORK FOR PEACE . PRESIDENT TRUMP IS COMMITTED TO FINDING A PATH THAT CAN LEAD TO A TRUE, JUST AND LASTING PEACE FOR ISRAEL, PALESTINIANS AND ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE REGION. FOR PEACE TO BE LASTING AND TO THE REAL MUST BE NEGOTIATED . BUT PEACE CAN ONLY BE NEGOTIATED WITH PARTNERS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO PEACE. HAMAS IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION THAT SEEKS THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES WILL NEVER NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS HAMAS. BUT LAST WEEK IN PURSUIT OF PEACE THERE WAS A HISTORIC CONFERENCE IN BAHRAIN . AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF PAINSTAKING EFFORTS, THE PRESIDENT'S EXTRAORDINARY MIDDLE EAST PEACE TEAM LED BY JARED KUSHNER UNVEILED A NEW VISION OF HOW THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE COULD BE EMPOWERED TO BUILD A PROSPEROUS VIBRANT AND PEACEFUL SOCIETY IF THEY CHOOSE PEACE OVER WAR. I KNOW THE CYNICS OUT THERE SAY THE PRESIDENT STREAMS OR PEACE ARE TWO BIG . IT IS ALSO TOO HIGH BUT IT WAS NONE OTHER THAN DAVID THEN GARY ON , ISRAEL'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER WHO SAID AND I QUOTE , ANYONE WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN MIRACLES AROUND THESE PARTS ISN'T A REALIST . SO WE WILL KEEP DREAMING AND KEEP WORKING FOR PEACE. AND LET ME ASSURE YOU , WHILE ANY PIECE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY REQUIRE COMPROMISE, YOU CAN BE CONFIDENT OF THIS . THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL NEVER COMPROMISE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL . IN THE WAKE OF ALL THOSE ACTIONS FINALLY THE PRESIDENT ALSO MADE ONE OTHER PROMISE . HE PROMISED TO STAND UP TO THE WORLD'S LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR . AND HE DID JUST THAT. WHEN HE WITHDREW THE UNITED STATE OF AMERICA FROM THE DISASTROUS AROUND NUCLEAR DEAL. THERE WILL BE NO MORE CASH FOR THE MULLAHS IN IRAN.AND PROFESSOR HAGAN MENTIONED I SERVED IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, I WAS ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. BACK WHEN I WAS IN CONGRESS WAS A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO BROUGHT TOGETHER SANCTIONS ON IRAN YEARS AGO . THOSE SANCTIONS WERE ISOLATING REGIME WAS IN BRINGING TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON IT. BUT IN 2015, WE ALL REMEMBER WE THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL WAS SIGNED , ALL OF THAT PRESSURE WENT AWAY. THE PREVIOUS AND MINISTRATIONS OPEL DEAL DIDN'T PREVENT IRAN FROM OBTAINING A NUCLEAR WEAPON, IT DELAYED IT. FOR ROUGHLY A DECADE. IN EXCHANGE, THE DEAL GAVE AWAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CASH SANCTIONS REALLY IRAN HAS USED THE PHONE MORE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON INNOCENCE ACROSS THE REGION. PRESIDENT TRUMP WITHDREW FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND WE HAVE REIMPOSED EVERY LAST SECTION THAT WAS LIFTED. AND UNDER THIS PRESIDENT, WE IMPLEMENTED A MAXIMUM CAMPAIGN TO CHANGE BRANDS MORE LINE BEHAVIOR AND HOLD THE REGIME ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS. IT'S REMARKABLE TO THINK AS WE SEE , OUR ACTIONS ARE ALREADY HAVING AN EFFECT . THEY'RE CUTTING OFF THE REGIME'S ABILITY TO SUPPORT THEIR TERRORIST MINIONS ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST . THE IRANIAN ECONOMY IS REELING UNDER UNPRECEDENTED US SANCTIONS. NOW AARON MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN CARING FOR HIS PEOPLE AND CONTINUING TO FUND ITS PROXIES WHO SPREAD VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND BREATHE OUT MURDEROUS HATRED AGAINST ISRAEL. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS, DESPITE PROMISES' TO THE CONTRARY IN 2015 , IRAN HAS BEEN EVEN INCREASING MORE OF THEIR MALIGN ACTIVITY AND VIOLENCE IN THE REGION AND WE'VE ALL WITNESSED IT. LAST MONTH AROUND ATTACK TANKERS PASSING NEAR THE STRAIT OF LOSE AND THEY DOWN AN UNMANNED AMERICAN DRONE. AND LAST WEEK AROUND EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT OF LOW ENRICHED AND RADIANT IN HALF. TODAY IT ACTUALLY PROCLAIMED IT WAS GOING TO START ENRICHING URANIUM BEYOND THE LEVELS PERMITTED BY THE AGREEMENT. SO LET ME BE CLEAR. IRAN SHOULD NOT CONFUSE AMERICAN RESTRAINT WITH A LACK OF AMERICAN RESOLVE . WE HOPE FOR THE BEST , BUT THE UNITED STATES AND OUR MILITARY ARE PREPARED . TO PROTECT OUR INTERESTS AND PROTECT OUR PERSONNEL AND OUR CITIZENS IN THE REGION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE IRAN'S MALIGN INFLUENCE . WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING PRESSURE ON THEIR ECONOMY AND OTHER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, AMERICA WILL NEVER ALLOW IRAN TO OBTAIN A NUCLEAR WEAPON . HISTORY TEACHES THAT WHEN AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES BREATHE OUT VIOLENT ANTI-SOMATIC HATRED , AND THREATS OF VIOLENCE, THAT WE SHOULD TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD. EARLIER THIS YEAR, MY WIFE KAREN AND I STOOD AND PRAYED AND GRIEVED AT THE AUSCHWITZ BIRKENAU NOT THE DEATH CAMP . IT WAS AN INDESCRIBABLE EXPERIENCE . TO WALK THOSE IMMENSE ROUNDS. KILLING ON AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE. AS WE GAZED DOWN AT THE REMAINS OF THE GAS CHAMBERS, AS WE WALKED PAST THE PERSONAL EFFECTS , THE PILES OF LITTLE SHOES THAT WERE GATHERED THERE. , IT MERELY REINFORCED OUR RESOLVE . THAT ANSWER TO THAT UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY THROUGH THIS AND EVERY GENERATION MUST BE NEVER AGAIN. NEVER AGAIN. NEVER AGAIN. ISRAEL WAS REBORN THAT WAS ALL , SO WE MUST AS AMERICANS MAINTAIN IT. WE CAN NEVER ALLOW THE MEMORY OF THOSE LOSSES IN THE HOLOCAUST TO BE FORGOTTEN BY FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD . WE MUST TEACH OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED. WE MUST PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF THOSE LOST FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS . AND IN THAT SAME SPIRIT, WE MUST NEVER ALLOW THE MEMORY OF THOSE LOST IN THE HOLOCAUST TO BE CHEAPENED AS A CLICHC TO ADVANCE SOME LEFT-WING POLITICAL NARRATIVE . BUT SADLY, SADLY IN RECENT WEEKS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SOME DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE IN THE NATIONAL DEBATE . LAST MONTH A LEADING DEMOCRAT IN CONGRESS COMPARED OUR US CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION FACILITIES TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS . OUR ALLIES IN CONGRESS , THE LEFT AND THE MEDIA SHAMEFULLY CAME TO HER DEFENSE . AS RECENTLY AS YESTERDAY MORNING ONE OF OUR ALLIES IN CONGRESS WAS ASKED IF THEY AGREED WITH COMPARING THE NOBLE AND COMPASSIONATE WORK DONE BY US CUSTOMS AND BORDER PERSONNEL DETENTION FACILITIES TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS OF NAZI GERMANY AND SHE ANSWERED ABSOLUTELY. TO COMPARE THE HUMANE WORK OF THE DEDICATED MEN AND WOMEN OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION WITH THE HORRORS OF THE HOLOCAUST IS AN OUTRAGE. THE NAZIS TOOK LIVES , AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT SAVE LIVES EVERY DAY. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. THIS SLANDERED LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS AN INSULT TO THE 6 MILLION KILLED IN THE HOLOCAUST. AND IT SHOULD BE CONDEMNED BY EVERY AMERICAN OF EVERY POLITICAL PARTY EVERYWHERE. I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND I WILL ALWAYS HONOR THE MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST AND WE WILL ALWAYS HONOR THE SERVICE OF THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT , ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. THE TRUTH IS AS I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY, WE HAVE A CRISIS IN OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. WE ARE ACTUALLY ON TRACK THIS YEAR TO SEE NEARLY 1 MILLION PEOPLE, ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER . TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WELL ADVERTISED LOOPHOLES IN AMERICA'S ASYLUM LAWS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, I'VE SEEN IT FIRSTHAND. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE COMING ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER OUR FAMILIES. WITH VULNERABLE CHILDREN. ARE BEING ENTICED BY HUMAN TRAFFICKERS AND DRUG CARTELS TO PAY CASH TO MAKE THE LONG AND DANGEROUS JOURNEY NORTH . AND IT'S A DANGEROUS JOURNEY. FRAUGHT OFTEN WITH UNSPEAKABLE VIOLENCE AND ABUSE . 70 PERCENT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ONCE THEY PRESENT AT THE BORDER REPORT BEING VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ALONG THE WAY. ACCORDING TO DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS, NEARLY ONE THIRD OF YOUNG WOMEN TRAVELING TO OUR SOUTHERN BORDER FROM CENTRAL AMERICA ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ON THE JOURNEY . OUR CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PERSONNEL DO COMPASSIONATE WORK TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MADE A DANGEROUS JOURNEY AND THEY PROVIDE THAT COMPASSIONATE SUPPORT EVERY DAY . UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN ACROSS OUR BORDER ARE PROVIDED WITH FOOD, EDUCATION, CARE AND TRANSPORTATION TO THEIR DESTINATION CITY ALL TAXPAYER EXPENSE. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORKS TO PLACE THESE CHILDREN WITH FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE UNITED STATES OR ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS LIKE FOSTER CARE. FAMILY UNITS WHO ARE KEPT IN ICE CUSTODY ARE SENT TO FAMILY RESIDENTIAL SECTORS WHERE THEY CAN RECEIVE SHELTER AND CARE. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, THE FACILITIES ON OUR BORDER ARE OVERCROWDED. BECAUSE THEY'RE OVERWHELMED . SO THE LAST SIX MONTHS, DEMOCRATS DENIED THERE WAS EVEN A CRISIS ON OUR BORDER. THEY CALLED IT A MANUFACTURED CRISIS, REMEMBER THAT? AND IN SO DOING THEY DENY ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO CARE FOR THE VULNERABLE FAMILIES GOING ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER AND AS I STAND HERE TODAY THEY CONTINUE TO REFUSE TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES USED BY HUMAN TRAFFICKERS . TO EXPLOIT THOSE VULNERABLE FAMILIES. IN THE FACE OF THIS DEMOCRATIC OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS PRESIDENT FROM GOOD STRONG. HE DEMANDED THAT MEXICO AND NOW MEXICO IS DOING MORE THAN EVER BEFORE TO SECURE THEIR SOUTHERN BORDER AND OURS . AND JUST LAST WEEK PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED INTO LAW A BIPARTISAN MEASURE PROVIDING 4.6 ALIEN DOLLARS IN HUMANITARIAN AID TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF HHS AND CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION . BUT YOU ALL DESERVE TO KNOW THE SAME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAD THE GALL TO COMPARE OUR DETENTION FACILITIES TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS VOTED AGAINST PROVIDING ADDITIONAL HUMANITARIAN AID TO THE SAME FACILITIES THEY DENOUNCED . IN THE FACE OF THAT TYPE OF DEMOCRATIC OBSTRUCTION I'LL MAKE YOU A PROMISE . UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, WE WILL SECURE OUR BORDERS. WE WILL PROVIDE COMPASSIONATE RELIEF TO VULNERABLE FAMILIES SWEPT UP IN THE CRISIS AND WE WILL FIX THIS BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM ONCE AND FOR ALL. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL WE'VE REACHED A DECISIVE MOMENT IN HISTORY . SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL AND THE JEWISH PEOPLE I BELIEVE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. ALL OVER THE WORLD ANTI-SEMITISM IS ON THE RISE . WE SEE IT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES , IN THE MARKETPLACE AND SADLY EVEN IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS . YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME THAT SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL WAS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE HERE IN WASHINGTON . I'LL NEVER FORGET THE DAY IN 2007 THAT I , A CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN REPUBLICAN WAS ASKED TO COFOUND THE CONGRESSIONAL ANTI-SEMITISM TASK FORCE WITH THE ONLY HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR EVER TO SERVE IN CONGRESS , THE LAKE AND GREAT CONGRESSMAN TOM LAND HOUSE . WE FORMED THAT TASK FORCE BECAUSE OF THE BROAD CONSENSUS THAT EXISTED IN THE CONGRESS THAT SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL IS SUPPORT FOR THE JEWISH PEOPLE BUT HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED . IT'S ASTONISHING TO THINK THAT THE PARTY OF HARRY TRUMAN WHICH DID SO MUCH TO HELP CREATE THE STATE OF ISRAEL HAD BEEN CO-OPTED BY PEOPLE WHO PROMOTE RACK ANTI-SEMITIC RHETORIC. AND WORK TO UNDERMINE THE BROAD AMERICAN CONSENSUS OF SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL. RECENTLY A FRESHMAN DEMOCRAT IN CONGRESS TRAFFIC AND REPEATED ANTI-SEMITIC TROPES . WE ALL REMEMBER THEM. SHE ALLEGED THAT CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL REFLECTED A ALLEGIANCE TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY. SHE SAID THAT ISRAEL HAD AND I QUOTE, HYPNOTIZE THE WORLD. LET ME SAY THIS FROM THE HEART. ANTI-SEMITISM HAS NO PLACE IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THIS NATION. AND ANYONE WHO SLANDERS THE HISTORIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL SHOULD NOT BE SITTING ON A FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. MAYBE MOST ASTONISHING OF ALL AS WE TALK ABOUT HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED , THE PARTY THAT HAS BEEN HOME TO SO MANY AMERICAN JEWS WERE SO LONG, RECENTLY EVEN MUSTER THE VOTES TO UNEQUIVOCALLY CONDEMN ANTI-SEMITISM IN OUR RESOLUTION. THAT'S WHY THE WORK OF CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. UNFORTUNATELY, CUFI IS BIGGER AND MORE EFFECTIVE THAN EVER BEFORE. YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER WHEN CHRISTIANS UNITED WAS A GROUP OF A FEW HUNDRED BIBLE BELIEVING CHRISTIANS . LAST TIME I SPOKE TO YOU, THIS ORGANIZATION HAD GROWN TO MORE THAN 3 MILLION BELIEVERS . AND ON MY WAY OVER I WAS JUST TOLD CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL NOW HAS MORE THAN 6 MILLION MEMBERS. ALL ACROSS AMERICA. KAREN AND I HAVE SHE SAID 7 MILLION. IS A MOVEMENT THAT SPANS THIS NATION AND THE MOVEMENTS FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS. KERRY AND I HAVE ALWAYS TREASURED OUR RELATIONSHIPS AT CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL. WE WORK HAND-IN-HAND WITH THIS ORGANIZATION WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF INDIANA . WITH YOUR STRONG SUPPORT I WAS PROUD TO SIGN THE TOUGHEST ANTI-BDS LEGISLATION OF ANY STATE IN AMERICA AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. BUT YOU DESERVE TO KNOW , REMARKABLY TODAY ALL BUT ONE DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT VOTED AGAINST COMBATING BDS ACTS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. SO LET ME GET THIS ONE MORE POINT. ANYONE WHO ASPIRES TO THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO STAND WITH ISRAEL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES WILL ALWAYS STAND TOGETHER . BECAUSE AMERICA AND ISRAEL ARE MORE THAN FRIENDS . WE ARE MORE THAN ALLIES. THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL OUR FAMILY. DESCENDED FROM A COMMON TRADITION OF FAITH, WE'RE A FAMILY THAT UPHOLDS COMMON VALUES AND TOGETHER WE SHARE A COMMON DESTINY. YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH THIS YEAR, THAT BOND CAME INTO HIGH RELIEF. IN THE FACES OF TWO EXTRAORDINARY MEN , THE PRESIDENT INTRODUCED TO THE NATION. ONE WAS A JEWISH AMERICAN HERO, SERGEANT AND LIKE IT, A VETERAN OF THE DAY AND THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE . TRULY A GREAT AMERICAN OF THE GREATEST GENERATION. YOU KNOW, LAST MONTH MARKED THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY AND WE WILL NEVER FAIL TO HONOR THAT HEROISM OF THOSE WHO SERVED IN THE GREATEST WAR. BUT IF YOU REMEMBER, SITTING BESIDE SERGEANT CITED WAS JOSHUA KAUFMAN. SURVIVOR OF DACHAU. A REAL CONCENTRATION CAMP. SERGEANT DESIGNED TO HELP LIBERATE A YEAR AFTER D-DAY. THESE TWO MEN , MORE THAN SEVEN DECADES LATER WERE REUNITED THAT NIGHT. UNITED NOT JUST IN THEIR STORIES BUT IN OUR HISTORY , IN OUR CAUSE. OF FREEDOM AND JUSTICE. 75 YEARS LATER, WITHOUT A DRY EYE IN THE HOUSE , THEY STOOD TOGETHER IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES . AND IN THAT RELATIONSHIP, CULTURE AND UNBREAKABLE BOND . TO AMERICA AND ISRAEL. THE BOND THAT BRINGS YOU ALL HERE TODAY. IT WAS ULTIMATELY A BOND OF FAITH . I'M TOLD BEFORE THEY LEFT THE CAPITAL THAT THE PSYCHIC FAMILY AND KAUFMAN FAMILY MET FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND HERMAN AND HIS BIBLE WITH HIM. THE BIBLE THAT HE HAD WHEN HE WAS IN SERVICE IN THE ARMY. THEY OPENED TOGETHER . AND THEY SAID PRAISE TO THE FAITHFUL GOD. THAT BOND ENDURED THE HORRORS OF WAR , ENDURED THROUGH THE DECADES AND IT ALWAYS WILL. SO WHY ISRAEL? WE STAND WITH ISRAEL TODAY FOR THE SAME REASON AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS STOOD WITH ISRAEL . TODAY AND EVERYDAY, WE BEAR WITNESS TO GOD FAITHFULNESS. AS WELL AS THEIR OWN. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS MARVELED THROUGH NEARLY 1900 YEARS OF EXILE, THE LONGEST EXILE OF ANY PEOPLE IN HISTORY, THE JEWISH PEOPLE DREW STRENGTH FROM THE PROMISES OF GOD THROUGH PILGRIMS, PERSECUTION AND EXPULSIONS IN THE GHETTOS AND FINALLY EVEN IN THE DEATH CAMPS, THE JEWISH PEOPLE CLUNG TO GODS ETERNAL PROMISE. AND THEY REMEMBERED, EVEN IF YOU'VE BEEN BANISHED TO THE MOST DISTANT LAND UNDER THE HEAVENS, FROM THERE HE WOULD GATHER THEM AND BRING THEM BACK TO THE LAND WHICH THEIR FATHER POSSESSED. AND SO WE DID. AND AMERICA WAS THERE. AMERICA WAS STANDING WITH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. AMAZING TO THINK EVEN IN THOSE DARKEST OF TIMES, HE HEARD FROM HEAVEN, HIS HOLY DWELLING PLACE, AND THEY HAD FAILED. FIELD. SO IT'S ON THE BASIS I CLOSE TODAY AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A FULL PROGRAM AHEAD OF YOU. YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM OTHER FRIENDS OF ISRAEL THROUGHOUT THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HERE AND LET ME JUST SAY BEFORE I CLOSE ON BEHALF OF MY WIFE KAREN AND OUR WHOLE FAMILY, THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT. IT IS THE GREATEST , IT'S HUMBLING TO BE WITH YOU TODAY, AND I LEAVE HERE ENCOURAGED. I I CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO LUNCH TO TELL THEM THAT I SAW YOU. AND I WANT TO CLOSE, I WANT TO CLOSE WITH FAITH. FAITH AND GOOD PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND AMERICA, AND IN THE IMMUTABLE BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP THAT BIND US TODAY AND ALWAYS WILL FAITH IN THE IDEALS AND THE PRINCIPLES OF BOTH AMERICA AND ISRAEL HOLD DEAR. A COMMITMENT TO LIBERTY AND FREEDOM, AND THE NOTION THAT WE ARE ENDOWED BY OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS. AND FINALLY, FAITH THAT IS EVER ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER FROM OUR NATIONS FOUNDING, PEOPLE DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND RELIGIOUS BELIEF, THE FAITH THAT BINDS THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TOGETHER. THAT HE WHO WATCHES OVER US WILL NEVER LEAVE US NOR FORSAKE US HERE HE WILL GUIDE US AND HE WILL SURELY BLESS US. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. MAY GOD BLESS ISRAEL. AND MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS THE UNITED STATES.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?462373-1/vice-president-pence-remarks-christians-united-israel-conference	Vice President Pence addressed the Christians United for Israel summit.

CSPANMP207201939	Mike Pence	2019-07-20	Vice President Pence Speech on Moon Landing 50th Anniversary	Speech	"Governor Ron DeSantis, First Lady Casey, Administrator Bridenstine, Director Cabana, General Selva, distinguished members of Congress, Marillyn Hewson, the dedicated men and women of NASA, and especially Rick Armstrong and the members of the Neil Armstrong family, and Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin: It is my great honor to be here with all of you today. It's great to be back here at the John F. Kennedy Space Center, as Vice President and as Chairman of the National Space Council, with my wonderful wife Karen, to celebrate - (applause) - to celebrate with all of you the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing a half a century ago that will be remembered forever. And I've been looking forward to this day, but allow me to bring greetings from another great space enthusiast and a great champion of American leadership in space. I begin today by bringing greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. Today, our nation pays tribute to the three brave astronauts who sat atop a 360-foot rocket that lifted off from Pad 39A 50 years ago this week - two of whom walked on the moon 50 years ago today. We also gather to pay tribute to the nearly 400,000 Americans - engineers, technicians, designers - whose sacrifices and dedication made it possible for Apollo 11 to complete what another president called ""the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure upon which mankind has ever embarked."" Let's hear it for all those who supported these three brave astronauts 50 years ago. When President Kennedy challenged the nation in 1961 to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the Earth before the decade was out, it's important to remember that our country was not yet ready to meet that challenge. We didn't have the rockets or the launch pads, or the spacesuits or the lander. We hadn't even invented many of the materials or tools that we would need. Not only did we not have what we needed, we didn't even know what we needed. But President Kennedy summarized that epic endeavor in one simple sentence: ""We choose to go to the moon."" The moon was a choice. An American choice. (Applause.) And like every time the American people make up their mind, once that decision was made, American ingenuity, grit, and determination - the achievement was inevitable. The only challenges that remained were challenges of engineering and science. The moon didn't come easily, and it didn't come without costs. And it did not come without grave danger or without sacrifice. To this day, Americans grieve the loss of three brave astronauts of Apollo 1 who were lost in a fire on the launchpad in January of 1967. And we think of them and their families even today. The risks for Apollo were so great, the odds were so long, that many feared that even if our astronauts made it to the moon, they might not make it back. In fact, history records that President Nixon prepared a speech in the event of a tragedy, where he would explain to the nation that the mission had failed. But, of course, the mission didn't fail. After all - with 400,000 men and women behind the mission at NASA, and with the hearts and prayers of the American people - how could it fail? For at the controls of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module, known as Eagle, stood two great Americans: Mission Commander Neil Armstrong and a man who is with us today, Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin. (Applause.) And circling overhead in lunar orbit was Command Module pilot Michael Collins. Fifty years ago today, at almost exactly this hour, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were about halfway into their powered descent on the final leg of their landing on the moon. There they were, standing beside one another in a capsule not much bigger than a couple of telephone booths, just minutes from touchdown. They thought they were ready for every contingency. After all, as Buzz told me just a few days ago, they had spent two years intensively training for this moment, and they'd run almost 600 simulated landings all designed to be more difficult than the real thing. Eagle had just finished its rollover to position itself for final approach, when all of the sudden, Neil Armstrong called out to Houston that Eagle had a ""1202 Alarm."" The problem was nobody on board or in Houston had any idea what a ""1202 Alarm"" was. Eagle's flight computer was overloading. Not only could they not see the moon out their windows; they couldn't know for certain how far they were from the surface. Not a good way to fly. And yet, how calm they were. Working with the team back here on Earth, they quickly resolved the problem without betraying the slightest anxiety. People all over the world were watching, with no idea that anything had gone wrong. That, my friends, is what they used to call the ""Right Stuff"". You know, there's a reason Neil Armstrong, as well, was called the ""Ice Commander"" in his day. When the original landing area turned out to be so full of large boulders that landing there would have doomed the mission and the crew, history records that Neil Armstrong calmly took control of the Lunar Module, skimmed along the top of the surface of the moon in search for a safe place to touch down. And by the time he found a safe spot, known to all of us as Tranquility Base, Armstrong and Aldrin had only 17 seconds of fuel remaining. Like every one of my generation, I remember that day. Six hundred million people around the world were watching their TVs and listening to their radios, waiting with admiration, anxiety, and wonder. And I was one of them - a little boy sitting in front of our black-and-white television in the basement of our home in Indiana. When those first snowy images of Neil Armstrong stepping off the bottom rung of the ladder beamed down to Earth at 10:56 p.m. on Sunday, July 20, 1969, they made an indelible mark - not just on my imagination, but on the imagination of my generation and every generation to come. It was a moment so rich in meaning that, upon hearing Neil Armstrong's first call from Tranquility Base, even the era's greatest newsman, Walter Cronkite, could only shake his head and utter two words: ""Oh, boy."" All at once, the nation held its breath - as through the crackling broadcast we listened to, we heard Neil Armstrong use those immortal words: ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" In that moment, the men of Apollo 11 did more than help expand our understanding of Creation, and they did more than win the Space Race. They brought together our nation. And for one brief moment, all the people of the world were truly one. Now, true to their creed, astronauts have never liked the idea of being called heroes. Yet for all they did - and for all the risks they took - if Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Mike Collins are not heroes, then there are no heroes. We honor these men today, and America will always honor our Apollo astronauts. (Applause.) They were heroes all. (Applause.) We honor the men of Apollo 11 by remembering their epic voyage and telling their story. But we also honor them by continuing the work they so nobly and courageously advanced in American space exploration. Apollo 11 was followed by five more successful moon missions culminating in the final historic journey of Apollo 17 - America's last trip to the moon. As we honor our Apollo 11 astronauts, we are also honored today to be joined by Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmidt. Thank you for your courageous service. As Harrison and I have discussed about his mission, while the last words spoken on the moon might not be as well-known as the first words, his fellow astronaut Gene Cernan said more perhaps than anyone could've known at the time. It was a challenge to our time. As he stepped off the moon on December 17, 1972, Gene - he said these words, and I quote, ""As I take man's last steps on the moon for some time to come, history will record…that America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow."" And then he ended by saying, ""We leave the moon as we came and, God willing…we shall soon return with peace and hope for all mankind."" (Applause.) Those were words of challenge in 1972. And in our time, as President Trump said, this generation of Americans knows that it is ""America's destiny to be…the leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown."" And standing before you today, I am proud to report, at the direction of the President of the United States of America, America will return to the moon within the next five years, and the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts. (Applause.) We're going back. After more than 45 years, where one administration after another chose to limit America's space program to low Earth orbit, President Donald Trump has changed all that. Early in this administration, the President revived the National Space Council within the White House to coordinate all space-related activities across the government, including matters related to national security. And we've been hard at work. The Space Council has helped bring together skilled leaders in business and industry to revive and renew America's commitment to human space exploration. And I'm pleased that many members of our Users' Advisory Group for the Space Council are with us today for this historic occasion. Join me in welcoming these dedicated and distinguished Americans. The President also signed Space Policy Directive 1, ""challenging NASA to lead the return of Americans to the moon, send the first Americans to Mars, and enable humans to expand and deepen our reach across the solar system."" It is our mission. And as I speak to you today, I'm proud to report we're investing in new rockets, new spaceships. We're working with private companies around this country to develop the new technologies of the future by unleashing the burgeoning private space industry that dots the landscape of this historic center and this nation. And within the next year, we will once again send American astronauts into space on American rockets, from American soil. Already, we've given our human exploration missions a newfound sense of urgency not seen in more than a generation. And, last year, NASA and American innovators began an accelerated design process for both the lunar orbital gateway and the lunar surface base - all of which we will need to support Americans on the moon and to train and prepare to send Americans to Mars. And while we've made great strides in advancing the President's bold vision for space - unlike in years past, we will have the budgets to match it. And that's why I'm especially grateful today to be joined by some of the greatest champions of American leadership in space in the Congress of the United States: House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, Congressman Robert Aderholt, Congressman Brian Babin, Congressman Bill Posey, and other distinguished members of Congress. Would you please rise and allow us to express our appreciation for your strong support of renewed American leadership? With strong bipartisan support, this President has already signed into law the largest NASA budget ever. And on this historic occasion, I'm told that we've also achieved a critical milestone in our effort to go to the moon and beyond. Today, thanks to the hard work of the men of NASA - men and women of NASA and of American industry, the Orion crew vehicle for the Artemis 1 mission is complete and ready to begin preparations for its historic first flight. In the coming years, American astronauts will return to the moon aboard the Orion, and they'll return with new ambitions. We will spend weeks and months, not days and hours, on the lunar surface. This time we're going to the moon to stay - and to explore and develop new technologies. We will extract water from ice in the permanently shadowed craters of the South Pole. We will fly on a new generation of spacecraft that will enable us to reach Mars, not in years but in months. Americans are leading in space once again. And today we're reminded - we're reminded how American leadership 50 years ago, and the accomplishment of Apollo 11, inspired our nation. As the President said, it ""ignited our sense of adventure"" and ""steeled our belief that no dream is impossible, no matter how lofty or challenging."" And as Buzz Aldrin said today, in his words, ""Looking back, landing on the moon wasn't just our job, it was a historic opportunity to prove to the world America's can-do spirit."" But as we lead in human space exploration again, we'll carry not only American ingenuity and pride, but most importantly, we'll carry America's ideals into the vast expanse of space - ideals of freedom and liberty. Apollo 11 is the only event in the 20th century that stands a chance of being widely remembered in the 30th century. A thousand years from now, July 20, 1969 will likely be a date that will live in the minds and imaginations of men and women, as long as there are men and women to remember - across this world, across this solar system, and beyond. So, today, we remember the heroes of Apollo 11 and all the heroes that supported them in their mission - some 400,000 Americans. But today, we also reaffirm our commitment to ""unlock the mysteries of space"" and to lead. And as we continue on this American journey, we go with the same resolve and determination of those who have gone before. And we go with faith. Faith in the courage of this new generation of astronauts - men and women of the character and caliber of those who have gone before. They're remarkable pioneers who will carry American leadership into space. Faith in the ingenuity of the men and women of NASA and all of those across the American space enterprise, whose creativity and tireless efforts in the days ahead will match that of their forebears who created and invented new ways to explore and expanded human understanding with American leadership. And finally, I believe, as we go forward - and as millions of Americans believe in their hearts, and have throughout the generations - that we'll go forward with faith that as those pioneers put on the spacesuits and climb aboard the rockets, that we'll believe that even if they rise on the wings of the dawn, even if they go up to heavens, that even there His hand will guide them, and His right hand will hold them fast. And that'll be our prayer. Today, we mark the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11. We celebrate the heroic astronauts who accomplished that extraordinary feat in human history - and all those who supported them. And today, we resolve, for the sake of all they accomplished, that America will lead in space once again. And this nation will once again astonish the world with the heights we reach and the wonders we achieve. So may God bless the crew of Apollo 11 and all who supported them on their historic journey. May God bless this new generation of pioneers and all who will support them. And may God continue to bless the United States of America."	Governor Ron DeSantis, First Lady Casey, Administrator Bridenstine, Director Cabana, General Selva, distinguished members of Congress, Marillyn Hewson, the dedicated men and women of NASA, and especially Rick Armstrong and the members of the Neil Armstrong family, and Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin: It is my great honor to be here with all of you today. It's great to be back here at the John F. Kennedy Space Center, as Vice President and as Chairman of the National Space Council, with my wonderful wife Karen, to celebrate - - to celebrate with all of you the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing a half a century ago that will be remembered forever. And I've been looking forward to this day, but allow me to bring greetings from another great space enthusiast and a great champion of American leadership in space. I begin today by bringing greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. Today, our nation pays tribute to the three brave astronauts who sat atop a 360-foot rocket that lifted off from Pad 39A 50 years ago this week - two of whom walked on the moon 50 years ago today. We also gather to pay tribute to the nearly 400,000 Americans - engineers, technicians, designers - whose sacrifices and dedication made it possible for Apollo 11 to complete what another president called 'the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure upon which mankind has ever embarked.' Let's hear it for all those who supported these three brave astronauts 50 years ago. When President Kennedy challenged the nation in 1961 to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the Earth before the decade was out, it's important to remember that our country was not yet ready to meet that challenge. We didn't have the rockets or the launch pads, or the spacesuits or the lander. We hadn't even invented many of the materials or tools that we would need. Not only did we not have what we needed, we didn't even know what we needed. But President Kennedy summarized that epic endeavor in one simple sentence: 'We choose to go to the moon.' The moon was a choice. An American choice. And like every time the American people make up their mind, once that decision was made, American ingenuity, grit, and determination - the achievement was inevitable. The only challenges that remained were challenges of engineering and science. The moon didn't come easily, and it didn't come without costs. And it did not come without grave danger or without sacrifice. To this day, Americans grieve the loss of three brave astronauts of Apollo 1 who were lost in a fire on the launchpad in January of 1967. And we think of them and their families even today. The risks for Apollo were so great, the odds were so long, that many feared that even if our astronauts made it to the moon, they might not make it back. In fact, history records that President Nixon prepared a speech in the event of a tragedy, where he would explain to the nation that the mission had failed. But, of course, the mission didn't fail. After all - with 400,000 men and women behind the mission at NASA, and with the hearts and prayers of the American people - how could it fail? For at the controls of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module, known as Eagle, stood two great Americans: Mission Commander Neil Armstrong and a man who is with us today, Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin. And circling overhead in lunar orbit was Command Module pilot Michael Collins. Fifty years ago today, at almost exactly this hour, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were about halfway into their powered descent on the final leg of their landing on the moon. There they were, standing beside one another in a capsule not much bigger than a couple of telephone booths, just minutes from touchdown. They thought they were ready for every contingency. After all, as Buzz told me just a few days ago, they had spent two years intensively training for this moment, and they'd run almost 600 simulated landings all designed to be more difficult than the real thing. Eagle had just finished its rollover to position itself for final approach, when all of the sudden, Neil Armstrong called out to Houston that Eagle had a '1202 Alarm.' The problem was nobody on board or in Houston had any idea what a '1202 Alarm' was. Eagle's flight computer was overloading. Not only could they not see the moon out their windows; they couldn't know for certain how far they were from the surface. Not a good way to fly. And yet, how calm they were. Working with the team back here on Earth, they quickly resolved the problem without betraying the slightest anxiety. People all over the world were watching, with no idea that anything had gone wrong. That, my friends, is what they used to call the 'Right Stuff'. You know, there's a reason Neil Armstrong, as well, was called the 'Ice Commander' in his day. When the original landing area turned out to be so full of large boulders that landing there would have doomed the mission and the crew, history records that Neil Armstrong calmly took control of the Lunar Module, skimmed along the top of the surface of the moon in search for a safe place to touch down. And by the time he found a safe spot, known to all of us as Tranquility Base, Armstrong and Aldrin had only 17 seconds of fuel remaining. Like every one of my generation, I remember that day. Six hundred million people around the world were watching their TVs and listening to their radios, waiting with admiration, anxiety, and wonder. And I was one of them - a little boy sitting in front of our black-and-white television in the basement of our home in Indiana. When those first snowy images of Neil Armstrong stepping off the bottom rung of the ladder beamed down to Earth at 10:56 p.m. on Sunday, July 20, 1969, they made an indelible mark - not just on my imagination, but on the imagination of my generation and every generation to come. It was a moment so rich in meaning that, upon hearing Neil Armstrong's first call from Tranquility Base, even the era's greatest newsman, Walter Cronkite, could only shake his head and utter two words: 'Oh, boy.' All at once, the nation held its breath - as through the crackling broadcast we listened to, we heard Neil Armstrong use those immortal words: 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' In that moment, the men of Apollo 11 did more than help expand our understanding of Creation, and they did more than win the Space Race. They brought together our nation. And for one brief moment, all the people of the world were truly one. Now, true to their creed, astronauts have never liked the idea of being called heroes. Yet for all they did - and for all the risks they took - if Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Mike Collins are not heroes, then there are no heroes. We honor these men today, and America will always honor our Apollo astronauts. They were heroes all. We honor the men of Apollo 11 by remembering their epic voyage and telling their story. But we also honor them by continuing the work they so nobly and courageously advanced in American space exploration. Apollo 11 was followed by five more successful moon missions culminating in the final historic journey of Apollo 17 - America's last trip to the moon. As we honor our Apollo 11 astronauts, we are also honored today to be joined by Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmidt. Thank you for your courageous service. As Harrison and I have discussed about his mission, while the last words spoken on the moon might not be as well-known as the first words, his fellow astronaut Gene Cernan said more perhaps than anyone could've known at the time. It was a challenge to our time. As he stepped off the moon on December 17, 1972, Gene - he said these words, and I quote, 'As I take man's last steps on the moon for some time to come, history will recordthat America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow.' And then he ended by saying, 'We leave the moon as we came and, God willingwe shall soon return with peace and hope for all mankind.' Those were words of challenge in 1972. And in our time, as President Trump said, this generation of Americans knows that it is 'America's destiny to bethe leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown.' And standing before you today, I am proud to report, at the direction of the President of the United States of America, America will return to the moon within the next five years, and the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts. We're going back. After more than 45 years, where one administration after another chose to limit America's space program to low Earth orbit, President Donald Trump has changed all that. Early in this administration, the President revived the National Space Council within the White House to coordinate all space-related activities across the government, including matters related to national security. And we've been hard at work. The Space Council has helped bring together skilled leaders in business and industry to revive and renew America's commitment to human space exploration. And I'm pleased that many members of our Users' Advisory Group for the Space Council are with us today for this historic occasion. Join me in welcoming these dedicated and distinguished Americans. The President also signed Space Policy Directive 1, 'challenging NASA to lead the return of Americans to the moon, send the first Americans to Mars, and enable humans to expand and deepen our reach across the solar system.' It is our mission. And as I speak to you today, I'm proud to report we're investing in new rockets, new spaceships. We're working with private companies around this country to develop the new technologies of the future by unleashing the burgeoning private space industry that dots the landscape of this historic center and this nation. And within the next year, we will once again send American astronauts into space on American rockets, from American soil. Already, we've given our human exploration missions a newfound sense of urgency not seen in more than a generation. And, last year, NASA and American innovators began an accelerated design process for both the lunar orbital gateway and the lunar surface base - all of which we will need to support Americans on the moon and to train and prepare to send Americans to Mars. And while we've made great strides in advancing the President's bold vision for space - unlike in years past, we will have the budgets to match it. And that's why I'm especially grateful today to be joined by some of the greatest champions of American leadership in space in the Congress of the United States: House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, Congressman Robert Aderholt, Congressman Brian Babin, Congressman Bill Posey, and other distinguished members of Congress. Would you please rise and allow us to express our appreciation for your strong support of renewed American leadership? With strong bipartisan support, this President has already signed into law the largest NASA budget ever. And on this historic occasion, I'm told that we've also achieved a critical milestone in our effort to go to the moon and beyond. Today, thanks to the hard work of the men of NASA - men and women of NASA and of American industry, the Orion crew vehicle for the Artemis 1 mission is complete and ready to begin preparations for its historic first flight. In the coming years, American astronauts will return to the moon aboard the Orion, and they'll return with new ambitions. We will spend weeks and months, not days and hours, on the lunar surface. This time we're going to the moon to stay - and to explore and develop new technologies. We will extract water from ice in the permanently shadowed craters of the South Pole. We will fly on a new generation of spacecraft that will enable us to reach Mars, not in years but in months. Americans are leading in space once again. And today we're reminded - we're reminded how American leadership 50 years ago, and the accomplishment of Apollo 11, inspired our nation. As the President said, it 'ignited our sense of adventure' and 'steeled our belief that no dream is impossible, no matter how lofty or challenging.' And as Buzz Aldrin said today, in his words, 'Looking back, landing on the moon wasn't just our job, it was a historic opportunity to prove to the world America's can-do spirit.' But as we lead in human space exploration again, we'll carry not only American ingenuity and pride, but most importantly, we'll carry America's ideals into the vast expanse of space - ideals of freedom and liberty. Apollo 11 is the only event in the 20th century that stands a chance of being widely remembered in the 30th century. A thousand years from now, July 20, 1969 will likely be a date that will live in the minds and imaginations of men and women, as long as there are men and women to remember - across this world, across this solar system, and beyond. So, today, we remember the heroes of Apollo 11 and all the heroes that supported them in their mission - some 400,000 Americans. But today, we also reaffirm our commitment to 'unlock the mysteries of space' and to lead. And as we continue on this American journey, we go with the same resolve and determination of those who have gone before. And we go with faith. Faith in the courage of this new generation of astronauts - men and women of the character and caliber of those who have gone before. They're remarkable pioneers who will carry American leadership into space. Faith in the ingenuity of the men and women of NASA and all of those across the American space enterprise, whose creativity and tireless efforts in the days ahead will match that of their forebears who created and invented new ways to explore and expanded human understanding with American leadership.

And today, we resolve, for the sake of all they accomplished, that America will lead in space once again. And this nation will once again astonish the world with the heights we reach and the wonders we achieve. So may God bless the crew of Apollo 11 and all who supported them on their historic journey. May God bless this new generation of pioneers and all who will support them. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?462875-1/vice-president-pence-speech-moon-landing-50th-anniversary	Vice President Mike Pence spoke about the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.	462875-1		
CSPANMP267201942	Mike Pence	2019-07-26	Vice President Pence Remarks on Workforce Development	Speech	Well hello Jacksonville. Governor descent this David Long and leaders in business and industry  To my friend of Trump especially to the men and women of this remarkable company it is great to be here among so many hard working Americans and a growing company in a growing state in a growing America let's hear it for Miller alack trick and the great thank you. Great to be here among so many friends that are making such a difference in the life of this economy in Jacksonville. And speaking to friends. Started today by bringing Greetings from a friend of mine. The man who I know loves the state of Florida who's fighting every day for hard working Americans I bring you greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America President Donald Trump you'll. I met your Before you heard from him but I have to tell you it's a special joy for me to be on the road today thrilly a great champion for working families She's a successful entrepreneur she's represented our country around the world and she's been working tirelessly to promote job training for people all across this country would you join me in showing one more round of applause for the senior advisor to the president of the United States if. You. Think. You know from the 1st day of this administration President Trump promised the American people that we were going to hire and grow America and we're going to work to raise wages for American workers and help rebuild this nation's economy. President Donald Trump has been delivering on the promise every single day in just 2 and a half years this president is actually signed more laws rolling back federal red tape than any president in American history we've unleashed American energy and now are a net exporter of oil and natural gas to the world we have free and fair trade deals being negotiated including the u.s. am Ca that goes before Congress soon and this president signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history that's what we call promises made and promises kept Florida. A and the results I don't have to tell you in this growing state but the results have been nothing less than amazing since Election Day 2016 businesses large and small it literally created 6000000 new jobs including nearly 510000 new jobs right here in Florida and you all know the economy the Sunshine State is booming and it's thanks in no small small part to the leadership of your new governor you may not realize it but the people of Florida are actually creating jobs at a faster rate than the national average in the past year alone the labor force in Florida has grown 582-4000 people and businesses have created 200000 jobs in Florida alone prosperity and opportunity are spreading all across this state so it's no wonder why your new governor is already one of the most popular governors in the United States of America would you join me in thanking Governor Ron the Santa Ana bright star job well. Oh it's amazing this economy is roaring not only 6. New jobs but the unemployment rate across America has hit a nearly 50 year low the unemployment rate for African-Americans and Hispanics Americans has hit the lowest level ever recorded wages are rising at the fastest pace in nearly a decade and I know it means most the most of the president and me and when you look at those wages rising they're actually rising at the fastest rate for hard working blue collar Americans to forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more Florida it's the truth. Oh and President Trump in are committed to ensuring that this historic prosperity reaches into every American and that's why we're here today and that's why we wanted to see firsthand this extraordinary apprenticeship program the Millers put into effect you know President Trump and I believe that all honest work is honorable and that American students and workers of every age income and background should have the chance to pursue their dreams and succeed and thrive according to their abilities and their ambitions so I'm here today to talk about our administration's efforts to give more Americans access to the education and training they need to fill the good paying jobs like right here at Miller you know it's important to note as we gather here today thanks to this president's leadership in our strong supporters around the country and here in Florida there are actually more job openings in America today than there are people looking for work. Recent studies actually have shown that nearly 3500000 manufacturing jobs will be created in America in the next decade and some 2 thirds of those jobs could go unfilled if we don't have the job training in the vocational education that we need workers in the skilled trades in particular are hard to come by in today's economy it's reality electricians welders and machinists you all should know you're in high demand but too few Americans these days are pursuing these valuable career paths and I'm sure all you hear Miller elected no because this company is a pretty rare company I saw firsthand when I was serving as governor state in India when companies like this one work with the with the government at every level to expand vocational education every body ends and we can expand opportunities for working Americans as never before and that's just what we're doing. In this in ministration I want to assure you we are absolutely committed to making sure that every American has access to the kind of education that will make your dreams come true that's why this president's taken decisive action to make job training in vocational education easier and more accessible than ever before in our 1st year in office for instance the president expanded apprenticeships and vocational training to help all Americans adapt to the ever changing 21st century economy last July the president established what we called the National Council for the American worker to continue to develop policies that will expand opportunities for every American particularly in in the in the various trades and skilled trades and last year President Trump launched what we called the pledge to America's workers to encourage businesses in every field to expand opportunities for training American workers for American jobs and he own our own avant garde Tromp to lead that effort by signing the pledge to American workers companies are committing to create new opportunities over the next 5 years for students and workers through apprenticeships continuing education and on the job training just like you have your Miller electric when the pleasure America's workers was launched the 1st year goal was 500000 job opportunities and in the past year with vodka Trump in the lead members of our cabinet have traveled relentlessly around the country meeting with businesses large and small to promote Career Education yesterday was the one year anniversary of the pledge to American workers and I'm proud to announce to you that. We didn't hit 500000 job opportunities. We actually hit 12000000 job training opportunities for more than 3. Governor to Sanders I'm proud to say that include 70 companies all across the state of Florida that have stepped up and pledged to create nearly 75000 job training opportunities for people across this great state you know that again is what we call promises made and promises. And I'm proud to report that hundreds of those opportunities will be created by our host today so on behalf of the people of Florida people of Jacksonville people all across this country let me just say thank you to Miller electric for committing to the future and the jobs and opportunities for people here in Jacksonville thank you. For looking out at all of you and meeting a lot of the folks going through the training program here. I couldn't be more impressed with Miller electric with this storied company and its storied history here in Jacksonville this a great company. It believes in investing in hardworking Floridians and Henry in the team here doing just that by participating in this program today Miller electric I'm told employs more than 500 apprentices across the country combining technical training with on the job experiences for new employees and in this company in fact in just the 1st few months of this year I'm told that Miller Electric has already enrolled 85 new members in your apprenticeship program here in northeast Florida nearly 15 percent more than the year before that's a real commitment to making it possible for people in this community to get the skills that you need to get those good paying jobs that exist right here today the truth is it's a growing company and I was talking to Henry and the team they told me that sense our historic tax cuts took effect Miller Electric has already added more than $300.00 good paying jobs right here in Jacksonville. From when I walked in your hand on the team here made it clear they understand their success is because of all of you wearing those Blue Miller shirts all of the year than in this program like a project manager who's worked here since 1906 I'm told she was hired on as a helper in the last 3 decades she's worked hard work smart. She's risen through the ranks while making this company better and more profitable I'm also told she recently earned an associates degree with help from Miller electrics to Ishan reimbursement program and today her expertise determination and thoughtfulness make her a model employee and someone everybody says is invaluable as a member of the Miller team so would you all join me in showing your appreciation for one of your great colleagues here Miller electric Donna Ward Donna were our. Current. Mother example is a project manager got his start here Miller electric back in 1990 and I'm actually old enough to remember 990 some of you Art Yeah actually most importantly before he before he was here he served our country in the uniform of the United States Navy he joined the apprenticeship program Ventura Lee earning recognition as apprentice of the year since then he's received numerous awards for his exceptional work today because of his experience and professionalism he handles some of Miller electrics largest and most valuable accounts but I understand that despite his record excellence he actually will tell you that his greatest accomplishment is working alongside his wife Lori Ann and their 2 daughters Lindsey and Taylor So would you join me and given her a warm round of applause to can more $0.10 for his service thank you thank you thank you thank you you are. Don can I know are just emblematic of all of you in this room so thanks for thanks for what all of you represent. You know as I travel around this country and the president travels around this country when we see grown companies we we know it's because there's a lot of hard working people bringing their integrity and professionalism to work every day so so to the whole Miller team give yourselves around of applause you all are so thank you thank you for the all. Right you. Guys are working to expand vocational education I want to assure you this administration is fighting to give Americans the tools to succeed including Americans that made wrong choices earlier in their lives earlier today I had a very moving experience we toured the headquarters of extraordinary program we started right here in Jacksonville called Operation New Hope started 20 years ago and and it was it was a way of organizing community leaders law enforcement communities and faith leaders to break the cycle of recidivism that exists today people go into prison and the statistics tell us that within within 5 years 50 percent of people that have been incarcerated for a crime often end up back in prison but Jacksonville said 20 years ago that you could do better and you've been empowering former prisoners through job training and placement and through full engagement by leaders and volunteers in the faith community has been truly inspiring I also understand the miller Electric has participated in this program in operation new hope and I just want to say to entering the whole team thank you for believing in 2nd chances and giving these people in our community to. Start again. In that vein last year President Trump signed what we called the 1st step back and we were just talking about it over an operation you know. It helps to match up prisoners with vocational education with educational coursework and with those important faith and character based programs that give them the tools of mind and the tools of heart to make better choices in their life as I said before it's remarkable to think that 50 percent of those who leave prison are re incarcerated within the next 5 years but listen to this while the recidivism rate in Florida is 24 percent that means people that have been in jail go back to jail 24 percent of the time convicted felons who go through Operation New Hope here in Jacksonville the recidivism rate is only 8 percent Jacksonville is the city of 2nd chances and you all ought to be proud. And inspiring meeting I expect you might read about in the paper in the morning but as I told everyone there I want to assure you this administration will always be tough on crime and this president and I want to Merica to be the worst place in the world to commit a serious crime but we also want to be the best place in the world once you've done your time to get a 2nd chance people that are willing to choose a better path choose an honest life we're going to continue to work for opportunities and I want to thank the governor for the work he's done in this space already and I want to thank him for his leadership on this issue thank you go. It really is what brought me to town today was to see that incredible program but with the tremendous success that we've made in the pledge for American workers and with the success here Miller electric I had to come by and see all the you as well and I just want to promise all of you that the president are going to continue to work hard to expand. Opportunities for pathways for people all across this country that want to want to get the education and training to be able to pursue new careers you know I believe each one of us have certain God given abilities it's to the very bottom of my heart I believe this and education ought to be and training ought to be about discovering what those abilities are discovering what your passion is and having the ability to pursue that just like everyone in this room has been able to do the truth of matter is that every one of you have Miller electric car emblematic of people that know that if you if you find your passion you pursue your passion and if you get the background in the training the experience the American dream can happen it's happening right here at Miller electric it's happening right here in Jacksonville and we're going to keep fighting to make it happen for people all across America that's my place to each and every month. I'm looking forward to meeting as many of you as time permits but I just want to say thanks thanks again to the great Miller tamed Henry and his whole family here we're honored by your hospitality Thank you all for the warm welcome the governor to Santas to evolve. Thank you for what you all of done to expand opportunities for people all across Florida and all across this country but for all the progress we've made. I want to leave you all with a challenge challenge all of you here to feel like what you're seeing in a growing American economy if you like policies that got Florida grown a strong state leadership if you like the policies this president's advancing at the national level I want you to encourage you to keep standing with us keep keep demanding the kind of policies the kind of leadership civil ensure that Americans have the opportunity to live their dreams. You know it's kind of interesting when President I 1st met about 3 years ago and he started talking me about maybe joining this ticket. Some people thought we were kind of different. You know I mean I'm a I'm a small town guy he's big city New York right. Now he's bigger than life always memorable I'm not right. And with truth is. As you know I got to know one another found out we had a lot in common and it was a belief in the American dream and if you want to understand what animates this president every single day it's a boundless confidence in the American people and the ability of any American with the right opportunities in the right education making the right choices to live the American dream his passion comes from the same place my mind as his grandfather immigrated to this country my grandfather immigrated to this country his dad build a building business in New York in Queens my dad built a little gas station business in a small town he went across the river and built a big buildings on Manhattan Island I felt a calling into public service I always tell people you know other than a whole lot of zeros we really got a lot in common. And I mean a 0 s.. And it separately from the American dream and that's really what we're fighting for every day and I want to remind you again if you leave your today. If you like what you're seeing and if you like the policies this president's advancing if you like the policies of governors advancing stand with us tell the story of the difference that it's making in Florida and all across this country and go tell your neighbors and friends about the opportunities that this economy's created and here's a number for you did you know there's there are 7000000 job openings in America today and there's only about 6000000 people looking for work. That's almost unprecedented in the history of this country that's why we're investing in all new ways to get Americans off the sidelines and into the workforce with the skills and education they need so I want to challenge every one of you as you stand with us as you're enthusiastic about these policies you're enthusiastic about a renewed focus on skills education vocational education go tell the story of what you're doing here Miller and what we're doing all across Florida and all across America tell your neighbors and friends who are unemployed or underemployed it's a great opportunities in this industry there's an opportunity for them to develop their skills to be a to be able to pursue their dreams and even a greater level tell them the Florida is growing every day that America is growing every day and more and more Americans are able about their dreams and I'm absolutely convinced that if all of us continue to share the story of the success of this state a nation or experience and we continue to tell our neighbors and friends about the opportunities to improve their lives and live out their dreams we're not only going to meet the needs of this growing economy but with your continued support with Governor Rhonda Santas and his allies at the State House with President Donald Trump in the White House and with God's help. 	Well hello Jacksonville. Governor descent this David Long and leaders in business and industry To my friend of Trump especially to the men and women of this remarkable company it is great to be here among so many hard working Americans and a growing company in a growing state in a growing America let's hear it for Miller alack trick and the great thank you. Great to be here among so many friends that are making such a difference in the life of this economy in Jacksonville. And speaking to friends. Started today by bringing Greetings from a friend of mine. The man who I know loves the state of Florida who's fighting every day for hard working Americans I bring you greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America President Donald Trump you'll. I met your Before you heard from him but I have to tell you it's a special joy for me to be on the road today thrilly a great champion for working families She's a successful entrepreneur she's represented our country around the world and she's been working tirelessly to promote job training for people all across this country would you join me in showing one more round of applause for the senior advisor to the president of the United States if. You. Think. You know from the 1st day of this administration President Trump promised the American people that we were going to hire and grow America and we're going to work to raise wages for American workers and help rebuild this nation's economy. President Donald Trump has been delivering on the promise every single day in just 2 and a half years this president is actually signed more laws rolling back federal red tape than any president in American history we've unleashed American energy and now are a net exporter of oil and natural gas to the world we have free and fair trade deals being negotiated including the u.s. am Ca that goes before Congress soon and this president signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history that's what we call promises made and promises kept Florida. A and the results I don't have to tell you in this growing state but the results have been nothing less than amazing since Election Day 2016 businesses large and small it literally created 6000000 new jobs including nearly 510000 new jobs right here in Florida and you all know the economy the Sunshine State is booming and it's thanks in no small small part to the leadership of your new governor you may not realize it but the people of Florida are actually creating jobs at a faster rate than the national average in the past year alone the labor force in Florida has grown 582-4000 people and businesses have created 200000 jobs in Florida alone prosperity and opportunity are spreading all across this state so it's no wonder why your new governor is already one of the most popular governors in the United States of America would you join me in thanking Governor Ron the Santa Ana bright star job well. Oh it's amazing this economy is roaring not only 6. New jobs but the unemployment rate across America has hit a nearly 50 year low the unemployment rate for African-Americans and Hispanics Americans has hit the lowest level ever recorded wages are rising at the fastest pace in nearly a decade and I know it means most the most of the president and me and when you look at those wages rising they're actually rising at the fastest rate for hard working blue collar Americans to forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more Florida it's the truth. Oh and President Trump in are committed to ensuring that this historic prosperity reaches into every American and that's why we're here today and that's why we wanted to see firsthand this extraordinary apprenticeship program the Millers put into effect you know President Trump and I believe that all honest work is honorable and that American students and workers of every age income and background should have the chance to pursue their dreams and succeed and thrive according to their abilities and their ambitions so I'm here today to talk about our administration's efforts to give more Americans access to the education and training they need to fill the good paying jobs like right here at Miller you know it's important to note as we gather here today thanks to this president's leadership in our strong supporters around the country and here in Florida there are actually more job openings in America today than there are people looking for work. Recent studies actually have shown that nearly 3500000 manufacturing jobs will be created in America in the next decade and some 2 thirds of those jobs could go unfilled if we don't have the job training in the vocational education that we need workers in the skilled trades in particular are hard to come by in today's economy it's reality electricians welders and machinists you all should know you're in high demand but too few Americans these days are pursuing these valuable career paths and I'm sure all you hear Miller elected no because this company is a pretty rare company I saw firsthand when I was serving as governor state in India when companies like this one work with the with the government at every level to expand vocational education every body ends and we can expand opportunities for working Americans as never before and that's just what we're doing. In this in ministration I want to assure you we are absolutely committed to making sure that every American has access to the kind of education that will make your dreams come true that's why this president's taken decisive action to make job training in vocational education easier and more accessible than ever before in our 1st year in office for instance the president expanded apprenticeships and vocational training to help all Americans adapt to the ever changing 21st century economy last July the president established what we called the National Council for the American worker to continue to develop policies that will expand opportunities for every American particularly in in the in the various trades and skilled trades and last year President Trump launched what we called the pledge to America's workers to encourage businesses in every field to expand opportunities for training American workers for American jobs and he own our own avant garde Tromp to lead that effort by signing the pledge to American workers companies are committing to create new opportunities over the next 5 years for students and workers through apprenticeships continuing education and on the job training just like you have your Miller electric when the pleasure America's workers was launched the 1st year goal was 500000 job opportunities and in the past year with vodka Trump in the lead members of our cabinet have traveled relentlessly around the country meeting with businesses large and small to promote Career Education yesterday was the one year anniversary of the pledge to American workers and I'm proud to announce to you that. We didn't hit 500000 job opportunities. We actually hit 12000000 job training opportunities for more than 3. Governor to Sanders I'm proud to say that include 70 companies all across the state of Florida that have stepped up and pledged to create nearly 75000 job training opportunities for people across this great state you know that again is what we call promises made and promises. And I'm proud to report that hundreds of those opportunities will be created by our host today so on behalf of the people of Florida people of Jacksonville people all across this country let me just say thank you to Miller electric for committing to the future and the jobs and opportunities for people here in Jacksonville thank you. For looking out at all of you and meeting a lot of the folks going through the training program here. I couldn't be more impressed with Miller electric with this storied company and its storied history here in Jacksonville this a great company. It believes in investing in hardworking Floridians and Henry in the team here doing just that by participating in this program today Miller electric I'm told employs more than 500 apprentices across the country combining technical training with on the job experiences for new employees and in this company in fact in just the 1st few months of this year I'm told that Miller Electric has already enrolled 85 new members in your apprenticeship program here in northeast Florida nearly 15 percent more than the year before that's a real commitment to making it possible for people in this community to get the skills that you need to get those good paying jobs that exist right here today the truth is it's a growing company and I was talking to Henry and the team they told me that sense our historic tax cuts took effect Miller Electric has already added more than $300.00 good paying jobs right here in Jacksonville. From when I walked in your hand on the team here made it clear they understand their success is because of all of you wearing those Blue Miller shirts all of the year than in this program like a project manager who's worked here since 1906 I'm told she was hired on as a helper in the last 3 decades she's worked hard work smart. She's risen through the ranks while making this company better and more profitable I'm also told she recently earned an associates degree with help from Miller electrics to Ishan reimbursement program and today her expertise determination and thoughtfulness make her a model employee and someone everybody says is invaluable as a member of the Miller team so would you all join me in showing your appreciation for one of your great colleagues here Miller electric Donna Ward Donna were our. Current. Mother example is a project manager got his start here Miller electric back in 1990 and I'm actually old enough to remember 990 some of you Art Yeah actually most importantly before he before he was here he served our country in the uniform of the United States Navy he joined the apprenticeship program Ventura Lee earning recognition as apprentice of the year since then he's received numerous awards for his exceptional work today because of his experience and professionalism he handles some of Miller electrics largest and most valuable accounts but I understand that despite his record excellence he actually will tell you that his greatest accomplishment is working alongside his wife Lori Ann and their 2 daughters Lindsey and Taylor So would you join me and given her a warm round of applause to can more $0.10 for his service thank you thank you thank you thank you you are. Don can I know are just emblematic of all of you in this room so thanks for thanks for what all of you represent. You know as I travel around this country and the president travels around this country when we see grown companies we we know it's because there's a lot of hard working people bringing their integrity and professionalism to work every day so so to the whole Miller team give yourselves around of applause you all are so thank you thank you for the all. Right you. Guys are working to expand vocational education I want to assure you this administration is fighting to give Americans the tools to succeed including Americans that made wrong choices earlier in their lives earlier today I had a very moving experience we toured the headquarters of extraordinary program we started right here in Jacksonville called Operation New Hope started 20 years ago and and it was it was a way of organizing community leaders law enforcement communities and faith leaders to break the cycle of recidivism that exists today people go into prison and the statistics tell us that within within 5 years 50 percent of people that have been incarcerated for a crime often end up back in prison but Jacksonville said 20 years ago that you could do better and you've been empowering former prisoners through job training and placement and through full engagement by leaders and volunteers in the faith community has been truly inspiring I also understand the miller Electric has participated in this program in operation new hope and I just want to say to entering the whole team thank you for believing in 2nd chances and giving these people in our community to. Start again. In that vein last year President Trump signed what we called the 1st step back and we were just talking about it over an operation you know. It helps to match up prisoners with vocational education with educational coursework and with those important faith and character based programs that give them the tools of mind and the tools of heart to make better choices in their life as I said before it's remarkable to think that 50 percent of those who leave prison are re incarcerated within the next 5 years but listen to this while the recidivism rate in Florida is 24 percent that means people that have been in jail go back to jail 24 percent of the time convicted felons who go through Operation New Hope here in Jacksonville the recidivism rate is only 8 percent Jacksonville is the city of 2nd chances and you all ought to be proud. And inspiring meeting I expect you might read about in the paper in the morning but as I told everyone there I want to assure you this administration will always be tough on crime and this president and I want to Merica to be the worst place in the world to commit a serious crime but we also want to be the best place in the world once you've done your time to get a 2nd chance people that are willing to choose a better path choose an honest life we're going to continue to work for opportunities and I want to thank the governor for the work he's done in this space already and I want to thank him for his leadership on this issue thank you go. It really is what brought me to town today was to see that incredible program but with the tremendous success that we've made in the pledge for American workers and with the success here Miller electric I had to come by and see all the you as well and I just want to promise all of you that the president are going to continue to work hard to expand. Opportunities for pathways for people all across this country that want to want to get the education and training to be able to pursue new careers you know I believe each one of us have certain God given abilities it's to the very bottom of my heart I believe this and education ought to be and training ought to be about discovering what those abilities are discovering what your passion is and having the ability to pursue that just like everyone in this room has been able to do the truth of matter is that every one of you have Miller electric car emblematic of people that know that if you if you find your passion you pursue your passion and if you get the background in the training the experience the American dream can happen it's happening right here at Miller electric it's happening right here in Jacksonville and we're going to keep fighting to make it happen for people all across America that's my place to each and every month. I'm looking forward to meeting as many of you as time permits but I just want to say thanks thanks again to the great Miller tamed Henry and his whole family here we're honored by your hospitality Thank you all for the warm welcome the governor to Santas to evolve. Thank you for what you all of done to expand opportunities for people all across Florida and all across this country but for all the progress we've made. I want to leave you all with a challenge challenge all of you here to feel like what you're seeing in a growing American economy if you like policies that got Florida grown a strong state leadership if you like the policies this president's advancing at the national level I want you to encourage you to keep standing with us keep keep demanding the kind of policies the kind of leadership civil ensure that Americans have the opportunity to live their dreams. You know it's kind of interesting when President I 1st met about 3 years ago and he started talking me about maybe joining this ticket. Some people thought we were kind of different. You know I mean I'm a I'm a small town guy he's big city New York right. Now he's bigger than life always memorable I'm not right. And with truth is. As you know I got to know one another found out we had a lot in common and it was a belief in the American dream and if you want to understand what animates this president every single day it's a boundless confidence in the American people and the ability of any American with the right opportunities in the right education making the right choices to live the American dream his passion comes from the same place my mind as his grandfather immigrated to this country my grandfather immigrated to this country his dad build a building business in New York in Queens my dad built a little gas station business in a small town he went across the river and built a big buildings on Manhattan Island I felt a calling into public service I always tell people you know other than a whole lot of zeros we really got a lot in common. And I mean a 0 s.. And it separately from the American dream and that's really what we're fighting for every day and I want to remind you again if you leave your today. If you like what you're seeing and if you like the policies this president's advancing if you like the policies of governors advancing stand with us tell the story of the difference that it's making in Florida and all across this country and go tell your neighbors and friends about the opportunities that this economy's created and here's a number for you did you know there's there are 7000000 job openings in America today and there's only about 6000000 people looking for work. That's almost unprecedented in the history of this country that's why we're investing in all new ways to get Americans off the sidelines and into the workforce with the skills and education they need so I want to challenge every one of you as you stand with us as you're enthusiastic about these policies you're enthusiastic about a renewed focus on skills education vocational education go tell the story of what you're doing here Miller and what we're doing all across Florida and all across America tell your neighbors and friends who are unemployed or underemployed it's a great opportunities in this industry there's an opportunity for them to develop their skills to be a to be able to pursue their dreams and even a greater level tell them the Florida is growing every day that America is growing every day and more and more Americans are able about their dreams and I'm absolutely convinced that if all of us continue to share the story of the success of this state a nation or experience and we continue to tell our neighbors and friends about the opportunities to improve their lives and live out their dreams we're not only going to meet the needs of this growing economy but with your continued support with Governor Rhonda Santas and his allies at the State House with President Donald Trump in the White House and with God's help.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?463051-1/vice-president-pence-remarks-workforce-development	Vice President Pence made remarks on workforce development and apprenticeship opportunities to employees of Miller Electric in Jacksonville, Florida.

CSPANMP68201944	Mike Pence	2019-08-06	Vice President Pence Fireside Religious Freedom Chat	Speech	Thank you all for. Thank you for that very warm welcome it is an honor to be here today with the men and women of the Alliance Defending Freedom and you are champions for our 1st freedom and it is my great honor to be with all of you today. But before we get started allow me to see a few words about the horrific mass shootings that occurred over this weekend in . El Paso and day. Like all Americans Karen and I were outraged and sickened by these barbaric attacks. As I stand before you today 31 people have died. 53 were injured. And it breaks our hearts. To see so many innocent lives cut short by unspeakable violence. What happened this weekend were acts of pure evil. And we express our deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. And we join every American praying for the injured and their families. In their hour of need. The Bible says The Lord is close to the broken hearted. And that will be our prayer for the people of Dayton and El Paso. We also commend the men and women of law enforcement in both states. Whose quick action. And courageous service undoubtedly saved lives they earned the admiration and gratitude to thousands and as President Trump said his address to the nation yesterday, hate has no place in America. And the sinister ideologies of racism bigotry and white supremacy must be defeated in the wake of previous violence hard ministration worked on a bipartisan basis with the Congress to strengthen background checks and improve school safety. In the wake of this weekend's mass shootings the president has brought the full resources of the federal government to assist law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for these heinous acts. Justice will be swift and certain. The president has also directed the f.b.i. to use all legal means available to disrupt hate crimes and to prevent domestic terrorism before it occurs. We directed the Department of Justice to work with local state federal agencies as well as social media companies to develop new tools to identify those seeking to do harm before they strike. And the president called for all of us to work together to end the glorification of violence in our society and to reform our mental health laws will work to identify entry and where necessary and voluntarily confine all those deemed a risk to themselves or the public safety. And that as we speak guard ministration is working with members of Congress to ensure that all those who pose a risk to public safety are denied access to firearms. And finally because justice delayed is justice denied we're developing legislation to ensure that those who commit mass murders face the death penalty swiftly. In years not decades. And tomorrow the president and the 1st lady will travel to Dayton and El Paso to express the sympathies and support of the American people for all those impacted by these hideous attacks and as a president also said. Now is the time to set destructive partisanship aside and find the courage to answer hatred with Unity devotion and love now is the time to overcome evil with good you know it's always been true throughout the long history of this country that in times of trial the American people turn to faith and prayer. Bible tells us that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray. That he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal our land. And in this dark hour for the people of El Paso. We do well to pray. Pray for healing. Pray for the families of those that were lost and engine pray for these communities and for our nation as a whole. We also do well in this time to recognize that the greatest source of community in the modern world is faith our nation was built on strong voluntary associations and depends on them more today than ever before from the American founding voluntary associations churches synagogues places of worship and religious education have been at the center of American communities and they are the wellspring of American strength. but as you all in ADF know well. We live in a time where. We've seen people driving religion from the public square and it's even become fashionable for many in the media and popular culture to mock religious beliefs. The freedom of religion was enshrined in the Bill of Rights as our 1st freedom because it was at the center of the American founding. And also because it's the wellspring of order in a free society. Our 1st vice president John Adams. Said and I quote Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other. That's why from early on in this administration President Trump has stood for the freedom of religion and stood with people of faith. tonne as you know well we've taken action to protect the freedom of speech in places of worship we've restored federal enforcement of our nation's conscience laws and taken action to protect the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and health care providers. We've also gone to court to protect the right to religious expression in the public square and the Alliance Defending Freedom has been there every step of the way.	Thank you all for.

CSPANMP910201961	Mike Pence	2019-10-09	Vice President Pence Town Hall on USMCA Trade Deal	Meeting	"Well, hello, Iowa! (Applause.) To Governor Reynolds; to Senator Grassley; Senator Ernst; former Congressman David Young; to EPA's Assistant Administrator Anne Idsal; to Speaker of the House Pat Grassley -- (applause); all the local leaders and guests and neighbors and friends; and to Rob Manning and Manning Farms: It is great to be back in the Hawkeye State. Thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome. I'm really honored to see you all turned out today. Thank you for taking some time away from work and your obligations to talk about an issue of great importance to Iowa and great importance to the nation. But let me say thanks to a few friends who are with us today, not just - not just do I want to thank her for that overly generous introduction, but I have to tell you, there is no more dynamic or hardworking governor in the United States of America than Governor Kim Reynolds. Would you join me in thanking her? Take a bow, Kim. (Applause.) She's doing a phenomenal job for Iowa. And let me thank another friend of mine who I've come to know well. In my duties as Vice President, I find my way to the United States Senate on a regular basis, and I get a chance to interact with both of your senators. But I'll tell you, this one - this one is amazing. She likes to say she's a mother, a soldier, a leader. She was born and raised here, combat veteran, served our country for almost a quarter of a century in the Armed Forces of the United States. And I'll tell you today: She is a champion for Iowa and a champion for the conservative agenda. Join me in thanking Senator Joni Ernst for her strong and principled leadership. (Applause.) Thank you, Senator. And finally, it's a real privilege to be here with, frankly, a hero of mine. I first discovered him on CSPAN back in the 1990s - (laughter) - when he was serving in the United States House of Representatives. And I said, ""I like that guy."" He would go on to the United States Senate. In fact, he served in the Congress now for more than 40 years. And I can tell you, he has been a champion for his fellow Iowa farmers like no one else. He has been a champion for our constitutional liberties as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and he's obviously a terrific grandfather. Join me in thanking Senator Chuck Grassley for his great, great leadership for Iowa. It really is great to be here with so many friends. And let me mention one more friend of mine, who, when I told him last night that I was headed to Iowa, I think he looked just a little bit jealous. But he's a man who loves the state of Iowa and a man the people of Iowa put their confidence in three years ago. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. But it is great to be back on a farm. And it's especially great to be here at a - at a great family farm here in Iowa. You know, I grew up south of Highway 40 myself in southern Indiana. (Laughter.) I didn't grow up on a farm but we - we had some cows and I hung up - hung out all the time with friends who were on family farms. And this one we're standing on today is so emblematic of everything that's great about family farming. You know, I'm told that Rob Manning is just the latest in a long line of farmers in his family. He's tilled this land and raised animals for five generations. And today, the hardworking men and women of Manning Farms have helped the Hawkeye State earn its place as the nation's largest corn producer, second-largest soybean producer, and the number-one producer of pork in the country. I mean, the truth is, what you grow here, what you raise here, you export around the world. So would you join me in thanking the Manning family and Rob and the whole team here at Manning Farms for all their leadership and all their contributions to the life of this state and nation? You know, the truth is, what you grow here, what you raise here in Iowa, you - you export not just across the country, but all over the wider world. So we're going to talk about trade today, which Iowa knows a whole lot about. We're going to talk about a great opportunity for Iowa workers and Iowa businesses. But before that, let me just take a minute to reflect on the progress we've made because of the confidence the people of Iowa placed in this President and our administration back in 2016. You know, when I think of the last three years, there's really only one way I can describe it: It's been three years of action. (Applause.) It's been three years of results. It's been three years of promises made and promises kept. But we're just getting started, Iowa. I mean, think about it: After eight years of the weakest post-recession economy since the Great Depression, President Trump said that we could get this economy moving again if we put commonsense, conservative principles and free enterprise into practice. And President Donald Trump delivered. This President has actually signed more bills rolling back federal red tape than any President in American history. And this President actually signed a measure that would ensure that farmers and ranchers can control and own their land ""in fee simple,"" as we like to say. Private property was restored when the President repealed the disastrous Waters of the USA rule. And President Trump also kept a promise when he signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. We cut taxes across the board for working families, for businesses large and small. And when he did that, we ended the death tax for nearly every American farmer. Death is no longer a taxable event. And we also passed reforms and made it possible for farmers to immediately deduct 100 percent of the cost of new equipment. Anybody around farming knows those input costs play a critical role in the vitality of farming and - and being able to literally write off those costs in a single year made a tremendous difference. So it's been about rolling back red tape. It's been about cutting taxes. But we've also unleashed American energy. Do you know, next year, the United States will be a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years? And last week, I want to tell you, with the strong leadership of Governor Reynolds and with the unrelenting leadership of Senator Grassley and Senator Ernst, President Trump announced an agreement on the renewable fuel standard that will ensure net production reaches 15 billion gallons every year. And I want to thank - I want to thank your senators and your governor for being such champions - such champions of renewable fuels. I mean, Iowa is not just going to be feeding the country, we're going to - we're going to continue to fuel the country as well. So, as we cut taxes, roll back regulation, unleash American energy, the results have been amazing. Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small in the city and on the farm have created 6.5 million new jobs, including 22,000 jobs right here in the Hawkeye State. But I'm here today, my friends, because, for all the progress we've made, we've still got work to do. Because as you heard from this stage earlier, we have an incredible opportunity before us. Over one year ago, President Trump negotiated the largest trade deal in American history: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. (Applause.) I was there. I was there all along the way for a lot of the negotiations, and I'll tell you what: The President drove a hard bargain. He put American jobs, American workers, and American farmers first, and negotiated a great deal. But as I stand before you today, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress have refused to bring it to the floor of the House of Representatives. And that's why I'm here. I came to Iowa today to turn up the heat. (Applause.) I came to Iowa today to say it's time for the Democrats in Congress to do their job, put politics aside, and pass the USMCA this year. The truth is - and we all know it - Democrats have been spending all their time on endless investigations and a partisan impeachment. But enough is enough. The American people deserve better. (Applause.) I mean, the time has come - the time has come for Congresswoman Cindy Axne and all the Democrats in Congress that represent Iowa to put Iowa first, put America first, and pass the USMCA this year. So if you run into him at a diner, or on a street corner - which I know is pretty common around here in Iowa - (laughter) - you need to tell the Democrats running for the highest office in the land that Iowa needs the USMCA. I mean, I'll tell you, one of the things I love about Iowa is that it's so much like Indiana - people with big hearts and strong opinions. (Laughter.) So let them hear your opinion. It will make a difference. Listen, I want to thank you for coming out today. I really do. Coming out in the middle of a busy week, taking some time to focus on an issue that's so important to this state, so important this nation. And I - let me - let me say again, how grateful I am to Senator Grassley, Senator Ernst, and your great Governor Kim Reynolds. Would you give them one more round of applause? They are just incredible champions. (Applause.) Thank you so much. And also, just on behalf of my wife, Karen, and our family, let me just take this opportunity also to say thank you for the privilege of being your Vice President. It is the greatest honor of my life. (Applause.) Thank you for the confidence you placed in your President and his Vice President. And finally - finally, let me say it's also great to be back on a farm. I'm pretty partial to the farm. (Laughter.) I mean, the truth is, farmers have contributed so much to the life of this nation, you can never calculate all of it. And I'm not just talking about to the economy throughout the long history of this country. But farmers and family farmers have contributed so much vitality to our communities and to our states. Farmers have served in our armed forces. Their patriotism and their values have strengthened this nation throughout our history. You know, I'm always struck - that book that I try and open every single morning in a little quiet time, how many times we're told to consider the farmer. And I believe that's because in - in the farmer, we - we find all the virtues that lead to a happy and productive life: honesty, integrity, hard work, resilience, family, and faith. And so you being out here today, and the support that you have shown to this President and his Vice President, our agenda, means that much more to me because it comes from the American farmer. It comes from the best of America. And in the days and weeks that lie ahead, I'll make you a promise. I'll make you promise. You know, one of the more humorous things that I ever hear is when people will stop me as I'm traveling around the country and they say, ""Tell the President just to keep going forward."" You know, that's something you never have to tell President Donald Trump. I tell people, like we used to say in Indiana, ""All the reverse is stripped out of that pickup truck. It only goes forward and we're never going to stop fighting for the agenda that Iowa voted for."" (Applause.) I promise you. We're never going to stop fighting - never going to stop fighting for the policies that will revive the American economy, strengthen the constitutional foundation of our courts, rebuild our military. And I know that with your continued support, we're going to keep America growing strong. We're going - we're going to make America safer than ever before. We're going to make America more prosperous than ever before. When we get this USMCA done and on the President's desk, with President Donald Trump in the White House, with these great leaders representing and leading you from the Congress to the state house, and with God's help, we're going to keep America great. Thank you very much. (Applause.) God bless you, Iowa. And God bless America. "	Well, hello, Iowa! To Governor Reynolds; to Senator Grassley; Senator Ernst; former Congressman David Young; to EPA's Assistant Administrator Anne Idsal; to Speaker of the House Pat Grassley ; all the local leaders and guests and neighbors and friends; and to Rob Manning and Manning Farms: It is great to be back in the Hawkeye State. Thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome. I'm really honored to see you all turned out today. Thank you for taking some time away from work and your obligations to talk about an issue of great importance to Iowa and great importance to the nation. But let me say thanks to a few friends who are with us today, not just - not just do I want to thank her for that overly generous introduction, but I have to tell you, there is no more dynamic or hardworking governor in the United States of America than Governor Kim Reynolds. Would you join me in thanking her? Take a bow, Kim. She's doing a phenomenal job for Iowa. And let me thank another friend of mine who I've come to know well. In my duties as Vice President, I find my way to the United States Senate on a regular basis, and I get a chance to interact with both of your senators. But I'll tell you, this one - this one is amazing. She likes to say she's a mother, a soldier, a leader. She was born and raised here, combat veteran, served our country for almost a quarter of a century in the Armed Forces of the United States. And I'll tell you today: She is a champion for Iowa and a champion for the conservative agenda. Join me in thanking Senator Joni Ernst for her strong and principled leadership. Thank you, Senator. And finally, it's a real privilege to be here with, frankly, a hero of mine. I first discovered him on CSPAN back in the 1990s - - when he was serving in the United States House of Representatives. And I said, 'I like that guy.' He would go on to the United States Senate. In fact, he served in the Congress now for more than 40 years. And I can tell you, he has been a champion for his fellow Iowa farmers like no one else. He has been a champion for our constitutional liberties as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and he's obviously a terrific grandfather. Join me in thanking Senator Chuck Grassley for his great, great leadership for Iowa. It really is great to be here with so many friends. And let me mention one more friend of mine, who, when I told him last night that I was headed to Iowa, I think he looked just a little bit jealous. But he's a man who loves the state of Iowa and a man the people of Iowa put their confidence in three years ago. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. But it is great to be back on a farm. And it's especially great to be here at a - at a great family farm here in Iowa. You know, I grew up south of Highway 40 myself in southern Indiana. I didn't grow up on a farm but we - we had some cows and I hung up - hung out all the time with friends who were on family farms. And this one we're standing on today is so emblematic of everything that's great about family farming. You know, I'm told that Rob Manning is just the latest in a long line of farmers in his family. He's tilled this land and raised animals for five generations. And today, the hardworking men and women of Manning Farms have helped the Hawkeye State earn its place as the nation's largest corn producer, second-largest soybean producer, and the number-one producer of pork in the country. I mean, the truth is, what you grow here, what you raise here, you export around the world. So would you join me in thanking the Manning family and Rob and the whole team here at Manning Farms for all their leadership and all their contributions to the life of this state and nation? You know, the truth is, what you grow here, what you raise here in Iowa, you - you export not just across the country, but all over the wider world. So we're going to talk about trade today, which Iowa knows a whole lot about. We're going to talk about a great opportunity for Iowa workers and Iowa businesses. But before that, let me just take a minute to reflect on the progress we've made because of the confidence the people of Iowa placed in this President and our administration back in 2016. You know, when I think of the last three years, there's really only one way I can describe it: It's been three years of action. It's been three years of results. It's been three years of promises made and promises kept. But we're just getting started, Iowa. I mean, think about it: After eight years of the weakest post-recession economy since the Great Depression, President Trump said that we could get this economy moving again if we put commonsense, conservative principles and free enterprise into practice. And President Donald Trump delivered. This President has actually signed more bills rolling back federal red tape than any President in American history. And this President actually signed a measure that would ensure that farmers and ranchers can control and own their land 'in fee simple,' as we like to say. Private property was restored when the President repealed the disastrous Waters of the USA rule. And President Trump also kept a promise when he signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. We cut taxes across the board for working families, for businesses large and small. And when he did that, we ended the death tax for nearly every American farmer. Death is no longer a taxable event. And we also passed reforms and made it possible for farmers to immediately deduct 100 percent of the cost of new equipment. Anybody around farming knows those input costs play a critical role in the vitality of farming and - and being able to literally write off those costs in a single year made a tremendous difference. So it's been about rolling back red tape. It's been about cutting taxes. But we've also unleashed American energy. Do you know, next year, the United States will be a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years? And last week, I want to tell you, with the strong leadership of Governor Reynolds and with the unrelenting leadership of Senator Grassley and Senator Ernst, President Trump announced an agreement on the renewable fuel standard that will ensure net production reaches 15 billion gallons every year. And I want to thank - I want to thank your senators and your governor for being such champions - such champions of renewable fuels. I mean, Iowa is not just going to be feeding the country, we're going to - we're going to continue to fuel the country as well. So, as we cut taxes, roll back regulation, unleash American energy, the results have been amazing. Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small in the city and on the farm have created 6.5 million new jobs, including 22,000 jobs right here in the Hawkeye State. But I'm here today, my friends, because, for all the progress we've made, we've still got work to do. Because as you heard from this stage earlier, we have an incredible opportunity before us. Over one year ago, President Trump negotiated the largest trade deal in American history: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. I was there. I was there all along the way for a lot of the negotiations, and I'll tell you what: The President drove a hard bargain. He put American jobs, American workers, and American farmers first, and negotiated a great deal. But as I stand before you today, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress have refused to bring it to the floor of the House of Representatives. And that's why I'm here. I came to Iowa today to turn up the heat. I came to Iowa today to say it's time for the Democrats in Congress to do their job, put politics aside, and pass the USMCA this year. The truth is - and we all know it - Democrats have been spending all their time on endless investigations and a partisan impeachment. But enough is enough. The American people deserve better. I mean, the time has come - the time has come for Congresswoman Cindy Axne and all the Democrats in Congress that represent Iowa to put Iowa first, put America first, and pass the USMCA this year.

Special Forces descended on Al Baghdadi as compound executing their mission the commander in chief gave them flawlessly made me proud to be an American. Our troops as the president said were incredible and by taking out the leader of ISIS we made measurable progress in the fight against radical Islamic terrorists but as the president made clear and all of you know the United States of America will never relent in our commitment to the enduring and total defeat of ISIS and any terrorist organization that threatens our country. I know I don't have to tell any of you that the fight against terrorism goes on 3 corps playing a leading role in our 76 nation coalition to defeat ISIS in fact 3 car was there when by March of this year our armed forces claimed the last inch of territory under the black flag of ISIS the ISIS caliphates territory was defeated as I stand here today hundreds of your brothers and sisters in arms are deployed in that region as we speak the heroes of Fort Hood have throughout the history of this institution also paid the last full measure of devotion on foreign fields of battle and as the nation will pause to remember next week 10 years ago on November 5th.

President Trump understands that our nation's security depends on our military strength and you are that strength. That's why from the earliest days of this administration this president is taking decisive action to make this military stronger than ever before in fact I truly believe when you look at the record of the last 3 years you look at what this president has done for our armed forces and their families for our veterans I think President Donald Trump is the best friend the armed forces of the United States have ever had. In our 1st year in office. President from signing the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan including the biggest pay raise for our armed forces in more than 10 years and you deserve every. Now those investments wouldn't be possible without strong partners on Capitol Hill there's 2 of them who are with us today I mentioned him briefly but I want you to be able to show your things so join me in thanking. 2 great Americans who represent Fort Hood in this area in the converse of the United States but I'm telling you I served in the Congress with one of them and they are tenacious advocates for our armed forces and their families join me in thanking Congressman John Carter and Congressman Roger Williams. The end. Thank you. With a renewed investment that this president our allies in Congress have made possible our army will soon have nearly 300 of the newest m one Abrams tanks and I know a lot of them are going to come in right here to Fort Hood so get ready. For new and better equipped. With our renewed American strength for once again embracing our role as leader of the free world under the leadership of President Donald Trump we're standing with our allies and we're standing up to our enemies our NATO allies are now contributing more to our common defense than ever before whether it's the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria with the Taliban or Al Qaida. With your service you know to this commander in chief we've taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms on their soil whether it be in the global war on terror or manning the ramparts of freedom in Europe or the Asia Pacific the men and women of the United States Army have been the tip of the spear and you always will be you know as I stand before you today it's I can tell you from my heart it's always humbling for me to have the opportunity to address the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States because you know for me my life didn't take me.

And My dad came home with the medals on his chest but he always told us kids the heroes in the Korean War were the ones that didn't get to come home so I was raised in a family that understood the service that you have and I don't mind mentioning I'm also the proud father of a United States Marine. So maybe it's all together fitting that I'm here as a family member of those who served our service and also just simply on behalf of a grateful nation make sure you all know how much the American people appreciate everything that you do it's my privilege to speak a word of gratitude to each of you on their behalf but I'll be happy your Commander in Chief let me offer you this admonition I want to urge all of you in these challenging times across the wider world be vigilant.

Special Forces descended on Al Baghdadi as compound executing their mission the commander in chief gave them flawlessly made me proud to be an American. Our troops as the president said were incredible and by taking out the leader of ISIS we made measurable progress in the fight against radical Islamic terrorists but as the president made clear and all of you know the United States of America will never relent in our commitment to the enduring and total defeat of ISIS and any terrorist organization that threatens our country. I know I don't have to tell any of you that the fight against terrorism goes on 3 corps playing a leading role in our 76 nation coalition to defeat ISIS in fact 3 car was there when by March of this year our armed forces claimed the last inch of territory under the black flag of ISIS the ISIS caliphates territory was defeated as I stand here today hundreds of your brothers and sisters in arms are deployed in that region as we speak the heroes of Fort Hood have throughout the history of this institution also paid the last full measure of devotion on foreign fields of battle and as the nation will pause to remember next week 10 years ago on November 5th. Terror struck at the heart of this case when a former Army psychiatrist opened fire inside the Soldier Readiness Center claiming the lives of 13 extraordinary Americans when I arrived last night I stopped and paid my respects at the Fort Hood November 5 memorial I walk by the columns dedicated each individual one of the 13 men and women who fell that day and I was deeply moved were grateful for everyone and made this possible are grateful for our intelligence community.

Let me assure you the American people stand with you every day. And President Donald Trump will always have your back. President Trump understands that our nation's security depends on our military strength and you are that strength. That's why from the earliest days of this administration this president is taking decisive action to make this military stronger than ever before in fact I truly believe when you look at the record of the last 3 years you look at what this president has done for our armed forces and their families for our veterans I think President Donald Trump is the best friend the armed forces of the United States have ever had. In our 1st year in office. President from signing the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan including the biggest pay raise for our armed forces in more than 10 years and you deserve every. Now those investments wouldn't be possible without strong partners on Capitol Hill there's 2 of them who are with us today I mentioned him briefly but I want you to be able to show your things so join me in thanking. 2 great Americans who represent Fort Hood in this area in the converse of the United States but I'm telling you I served in the Congress with one of them and they are tenacious advocates for our armed forces and their families join me in thanking Congressman John Carter and Congressman Roger Williams. The end. Thank you. With a renewed investment that this president our allies in Congress have made possible our army will soon have nearly 300 of the newest m one Abrams tanks and I know a lot of them are going to come in right here to Fort Hood so get ready. For new and better equipped. With our renewed American strength for once again embracing our role as leader of the free world under the leadership of President Donald Trump we're standing with our allies and we're standing up to our enemies our NATO allies are now contributing more to our common defense than ever before whether it's the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria with the Taliban or Al Qaida. With your service you know to this commander in chief we've taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms on their soil whether it be in the global war on terror or manning the ramparts of freedom in Europe or the Asia Pacific the men and women of the United States Army have been the tip of the spear and you always will be you know as I stand before you today it's I can tell you from my heart it's always humbling for me to have the opportunity to address the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States because you know for me my life didn't take me. Into service in our armed forces and I'm proud to say I'm the son of a United States Army combat veteran who served in Korea Lieutenant Edward j. pants. And My dad came home with the medals on his chest but he always told us kids the heroes in the Korean War were the ones that didn't get to come home so I was raised in a family that understood the service that you have and I don't mind mentioning I'm also the proud father of a United States Marine. So maybe it's all together fitting that I'm here as a family member of those who served our service and also just simply on behalf of a grateful nation make sure you all know how much the American people appreciate everything that you do it's my privilege to speak a word of gratitude to each of you on their behalf but I'll be happy your Commander in Chief let me offer you this admonition I want to urge all of you in these challenging times across the wider world be vigilant. Mind your mission respect the unified chain of command keep taking care of each other never doubt that every decision you make matters to the American people and its security of this nation give America your best every day the American people are counting on you and given the long and storied history of 3 corps and Fort Hood we know we can so thank you again for the warm welcome and thank you for your service I say that on behalf of a grateful nation. Because we all know that your service comes with sacrifice the truth is you step forward in a calling where you've decided to count our lives as more important than your own and in generations that have gone before in those that have paid the last full measure of devotion you know the soldier does not bear the sword in vain the American people understand the risks that you take and embrace every day but as you do that as you prepare as you deploy I want to assure you that you do not bear that burden alone wherever you are called to serve. Wherever you are deployed. I promise you you will carry with you the. Strength and pride of this nation the support of the American people you carry with you the confidence of your commander in chief and I also know you will carry with you the prayers of millions of Americans millions of Americans pray every day for all of you who serve and defend this nation we pray in the ancient words of the sourness my prayer today that no harm would befall you know disaster would come near your tent and that as you serve here in around the world that his faithfulness. Will always be your shield and ramp I know that prayer and that agent sentiment around the hearts of people across this country every day never doubt it and as I leave you here today I know as long as we have men and women with the courage to serve and step forward and stand on freedom's ramparts as long as we have heroes willing to put their lives on the line for us and for our freedom as long as we have Patriots. Like all of you we will protect this nation we will defend our freedom and we will forge a future of security prosperity and peace for ourselves and for generations to come and we will keep safe this last best hole on earth the United States of America this will defend So thank you.

We said we could make America safe again we said we could make America prosperous again we said we could affirm all the foundational constitutional principles have men and women appointed to our courts who will uphold all the God given liberties enshrouded in our founding documents again. In 3 years later I'm proud to report in strong partnership with Governor Matt Bevan President Donald Trump has delivered. We've gotten this economy rolling again just like Governor mad Bevan did with this president arrived in Washington d.c. and with a strong partnership with our allies on Capitol Hill we cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small we just like your governor did we cut red tape at historic levels we've stood by American energy independent the and the war on coal is over in the American economy and Kentucky's economy are booming as a result of the leadership of President Donald Trump and Governor Matt Bevin. You know I want to I want to acknowledge my great admiration for one of those members of Congress who I had the privilege of serving with for 12 years on Capitol Hill while I represented the state of Indiana he texturally cheered the Appropriations Committee but he never lost the common touch me to know your congressman is to know a man of faith. And integrity who always put the interest of eastern Kentucky 1st and he's been a champion for this region he's been a champion of for a military spin a champion for law enforcement and let me just say not only Kentucky but America owes a debt of gratitude to the long and distinguished service of Congressman Rodgers. Everything we've been able to do over the last 3 years in Washington d.c. would not have been possible without the strong unwavering partnership that Congressman Rogers in a Republican majority in those 1st 2 years of our administration made possible so Congressman I want to thank you the economy is booming again the President Trump said we're going to make America safe again and I'm proud to report and I'm proud to be a vice president who served alongside a president who's made the largest investments in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan we've rebuilt our military. I know the men and women who are standing around us today wearing this uniform many of you were the other uniform and we thank you for your service but as the world saw this last weekend the investments in our armed forces have made the strongest military in history the world stronger still and with the successful raid that took out the leader of ISIS America and the world are safer thanks to our Armed Forces and our commander in chief. But while the American military defends our nation and sees to America's defense around the world the men and women that are gathered around us here today keep our family safe every day at home and I want to assure you from the 1st day of this administration. You have a president and a governor who have stood without apology for the men and women of law enforcement and the first responders. for governor Bevan came into office before President Trump came into office it had been a challenging time for law enforcement we all remember those days seem like many reflexively want to blame law enforcement any time tragedy would strike. But that's no more this president's work closely with your congressman and with your governor to make sure our local law enforcement through Homeland Security and various other agencies have the resources and the support that you need and we have alongside your governor this president has given the men and women of law enforcement the respect that you earn every single day and we all will.

That required you to decide that our lives are more important than yours and I want you to know that we know that just as governor Bevan just said we understand we understand the risk that you take when you put on that uniform every morning walk out the door it's not it's not like another job and so let me not only say thank you to you but let me say thank you to your families thank you for your spouses thank you to your kids and your grandkids and your parents because the men and women in uniform understand that it's not just they that serve it's their families that support them and pray for them and encourage them so let's thank the families of these great here.

My uncle was a Chicago police officer for 25 years and when I was a little boy me and my 3 brothers and 2 sisters to go up to Chicago I'd see him dressed up had enough to work and that to me was what hero looked like and my cousin's husband just retired after 25 years from Chicago Fire Department coincidentally he's Irish. He's extraordinary and courageous man 2 years on disability from service related injuries went right back into the fight so that's why I want to I just want to speak a word of gratitude to you and more than anything else a word of admiration and all the hours are long and as the governor said we couldn't ever pay you what it's worth the risk that you take in the lives that you save the care and I just want to come by today. Along with your governor and your 1st lady just to make sure that you know every day.

WE GATHERED AND HAD A WORSHIP SERVICE IN LIKE THEY HAVE DONE 35 YEARS EARLIER, WE WALKED TO THE BRIDGE AND AS WE WERE WALKING UP, THERE WAS AN OLD PASTOR NAMED DR. F D REIS AND I WAS WALKING WITH HIM. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN THERE, THE BRIDGE IS ACTUALLY STEEP AND YOU HAVE TO WALK UP TO THE MIDDLE BEFORE YOU CAN SEE THE OTHER SIDE AND THE PASTOR TOLD ME THEY HAD WALKED TO THE TOP OF THE BRIDGE AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE TOP THEY LOOKED DOWN AND SAW A SEA OF FLASHING LIGHTS AND POLICE AND MOUNTED OFFICERS AND I LOOKED AT HIM AS WE LOOKS DOWN ON THE SCENE 45 YEARS LATER , I SAID TO HIM DID YOU THINK ABOUT TURNING BACK? HE SMILED THE WAY WALDMAN SOMETIMES SMILE AND HE SAID WE HAD ALL PRAYED AND DECIDED TO GO ON REGARDLESS AND SO THEY DID. WHEN THAT MARCH WAS OVER, THE BRUTALITY OF THAT MOMENT WOULD INSPIRE THE PASSAGE OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND HELP TRANSFORM THIS NATION INTO A MORE PERFECT UNION BECAUSE OF THEIR COURAGE AND BECAUSE OF THEIR FAITH. WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER OUR LOOKED AT DR. REESE AND STUCK MY HAND OUT FOR WHAT THEY DONE FOR THE COUNTRY AND HE LOOKED AT ME ONE MORE TIME AND SMILED. HE SAID DON'T THINK ME OR WHAT WE DID HERE, GOD DID SOMETHING HERE. THAT IS PAID , FAITH. THAT IS THE FAITH OF THIS COMMUNITY. FAITH THAT GENERATIONS OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE GONE THROUGH FOR CENTURIES. IT IS STILL DRIVING US TODAY TO A MORE PERFECT UNION. FAITH THAT WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS, THERE IS LIBERTY. THAT MEANS FREEDOM ALWAYS WINDS , WINS AND IF WE PUT OUR TRUST IN HIM, WE WILL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH THESE CHALLENGING TIMES AND REACH MORE AMERICANS THAN EVER BEFORE AND WE WILL RENEW AND STRENGTHEN AS NEVER BEFORE THIS ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. MEN AND WOMEN, I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF THE WAY AND LET YOU HEAR FROM THE ONE YOU CAME TO HEAR. HAVE CONFIDENCE, HAVE FAITH. WE HAVE WORK TO DO IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR TO DO IT. I'M CONFIDENT THAT IF WE DO WHAT WE CAN BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY 2020, WE WILL DELIVER ANOTHER GREAT VICTORY FOR EVERY AMERICAN COME NOVEMBER 2020. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFER THAN EVER BEFORE, MAKE AMERICA MORE PROSPEROUS THAN EVER BEFORE. WITH YOUR HARD WORK AND TELLING OUR STORY TO EVERY COMMUNITY, WE WILL PUT PRESIDENT TRUMP BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS AND WE WILL KEEP AMERICA [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. (music) (music) (music) THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE TO BE HERE BECAUSE IN A SOCIETY WE LIVE HERE TODAY, IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE TO SAY YOU ARE SUPPORTING PRESIDENT TRUMP AND IT IS QUITE INTERESTING HOW PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE AND HOW TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE AND CHANGE THEIR MINDS. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON. YOU GO BACK SINCE THE DAVE'S , THE DAYS OF SLAVERY. THEY TOLD THE ONES IN THE HOUSE THEY WERE BETTER THAN THE ONES IN THE YARD AND THE ONES IN THE YARD BETTER THAN THE ONES IN THE FIELD AND ON AND ON IT WENT TRYING TO DIVIDE PEOPLE TODAY, THEY SAY IF YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE, THEN YOU ARE SOMEHOW AN UNCLE TOM, A HORRIBLE PERSON, A DEMON, WHAT A BUNCH OF CRAFT , CRAP. I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO COME OUT. IT DOES NOT BOTHER ME ANYMORE BECAUSE I ONLY WORRY WHAT GOD THINKS. SOMETIMES PEOPLE ASK ME COME UP , ASK ME, WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU , WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? YOU'VE CHANGED. [NO AUDIO] AND THEN TO NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT AND THEN TO BALTIMORE, A BASTION OF LIBERALISM. THEN I DID SOMETHING THAT LIBERALS ARE NEVER SUPPOSED TO DO. I LISTENED TO A CONSERVATIVE, I LISTENED TO RONALD REAGAN. I SAID HE DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A HORRIBLE, RACIST PERSON, HE SOUNDS JUST LIKE MY MOTHER AND AT THAT POINT I STARTED THINKING FOR MYSELF. IT MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY MEDICAL CAREER TOO. THAT IS THE REASON THAT GOD GAVE US THESE CONFLICTS , COMPLEX BRAINS. FOR GOD GIVE YOU SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO YOU CAN BE A SHEEP AND FOLLOW SOMEONE ELSE OR TO THINK FOR YOURSELF? DON'T YOU FIND IT FASCINATING THAT SO MANY PEOPLE SAY THE PRESIDENT IS A RACIST? IT SEEMS LIKE SOME YEARS AGO, JESSE JACKSON GAVE AN AWARD IN NEW YORK CITY BECAUSE HE OPENED UP SOME MONEY OPPORTUNITIES FOR BLACK PEOPLE. IS THAT WHAT A RACIST DOES? HE IS THE ONE WHO FINALLY GOT A SECOND CHANCE AT [INDISCERNIBLE] WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE, HE BROUGHT THE OFFICE OF HBCUS THAT COULD GET MORE MONEY THAN EVER, OPPORTUNITIES SO PEOPLE COULD TAKE THE MONEY AND DIRECTED TO THE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE, AND ECONOMY OR YOU HAVE THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES FOR BLACK PEOPLE IN HISTORY AND IT GOES ON AND ON. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IF THE IS A RACIST, HE'S A AWFULLY BAD ONE. HE NEEDS TO GET A LESSON FROM THE REAL RACISTS WERE PEOPLE SAY BECAUSE OF YOUR SKIN COLOR YOU HAVE TO THINK A CERTAIN WAY, THOSE ARE THE REAL RACISTS. THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT A RISING TIDES , RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL. THE MEDIA LIKES TO PICK ON HIM, ANY LITTLE THING. HE'S NOT PERFECT. THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS PERFECT WAS JESUS AND THEY CRUCIFIED HIM. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE AND ALL THE INCREDIBLE THINGS HAPPENING IN THE MISSIONARIES. TALK TO YOUR FAMILY, TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS. IF ALL THEY'RE DOING IS LOOKING AT CERTAIN MEDIA, THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW ALL THE THINGS THAT HE HAS DONE AND SO THEY PERPETRATE THIS HORRIBLE IMAGE OF HIM BEING A BAD PERSON. I TRY TO WORK WITH THEM ALL THE TIME. DURING THE CAMPAIGN WHEN WE WERE HAVING A DEBATE AND I CANNOT HEAR MY NAME, I WAS STOOD THERE , I STOOD THERE. I WAS , I COULD NOT HEAR MY NAME. I STOOD THERE AND HE WAS ONLY ONE WHO WAITED UNTIL THEY STRAIGHT WITHOUT , STRAIGHTENED IT OUT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DONALD TRUMP. (music) THANK YOU. WHAT A GROUP. THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. IT IS A BIG CROWD OF PEOPLE. I WANT TO THANK BEN CARSON FOR THE INTRODUCTION AND FOR DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB AND VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. ALWAYS A GREAT GENTLEMEN, GREAT MAN. GLAD TO BE HERE TO LAUNCH OUR NEW BLACKS FOR TRUMP. AFRICAN-AMERICANS FOR TRUMP, CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT. WHAT DO YOU PREFER? WE ARE DOING WELL, WE HAVE OUR BEST EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. THE SUPPORT WE ARE GETTING FROM THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING AND I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE AND DEVOTION. 2016, THERE WAS A MOVEMENT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE AND YOU MADE A GOOD , MADE UP A GOOD PORTION OF THAT. I HEAR YOU KNOCKING THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE, IT IS THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. WITH YOUR HELP, WE'RE GOING TO TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO EVERY COMMUNITY AND CAMPAIGN FOR EVERY LAST AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE IN 2020. FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CAMPAIGN, WE TOOK ON THE WASHINGTON LOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS. THEY COME AT YOU, BUT WE ARE WINNING LIKE NO ONE HAS EVER ONE BEFORE. WE TOOK ON THE CORRUPT MEDIA AND POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT THAT HAS FAILED THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY FOR DECADES AND WE ARE STARTING TO LEARN THINGS THAT WE NEVER THOUGHT WERE POSSIBLE. EXACTLY THREE YEARS AGO TONIGHT, THE PEOPLE SPOKE IN WE TOOK OUR COUNTRY BACK AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE WON AN EXTRAORDINARY VICTORY FOR ALL AMERICANS AND ONE YEAR FROM NOW WE WILL WIN ANOTHER INCREDIBLE VICTORY AND WE WILL DO IT FROM A GROUNDSWELL OF SUPPORT FROM AFRICAN-AMERICAN PATRIOTS. ALTOGETHER, WE HAVE NEVER DONE BETTER. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS THE ORIGINAL HOME OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND NOW AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE RETURNING. IT WAS A 100 YEAR TRIP AND COMING BACK TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, PEOPLE FORGET IN LINCOLN WAS REPUBLICAN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE 2020 CHANCE A MAKE IT A CHANCE THAT YOU TAKE . WHEN I FIRST CAME OUT AND STARTED TALKING ABOUT VOTE FOR ME, THAT WAS TAKING A CHANCE BECAUSE I WAS NOT A POLITICIAN. NOW EVERYTHING HAS COME TRUE MUCH MORE SO. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO THE NUMBERS AND MAKE 2020 A YEAR OF CHANGE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. YOU ARE A BIG PART OF WHAT IS GOING ON. WE'RE GLAD TO BE JOINED BY HARRISON FORD , HARRISON FLOYD. WHERE IS HARRISON? HE DID NOT EVEN GET A GOOD LOCATION. HARRISON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT JOB YOU ARE DOING AND HERMAN CAIN AND PASTOR DARRELL SCOTT. THANK YOU. , P ARE. THIS GUY, I SAID IS HE REALLY A PASTOR? , DARRELL, COME UP HERE. THIS GUY, I SAID IS HE REALLY A PASTOR? HE IS TOUGH. ONE THING I HAVE LEARNED IS IF I CANNOT WIN THE DEBATE, I'M TURNING IT INTO AN ARGUMENT. JESUS SAID OF ABRAHAM, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE MY DAY? HE SAW IT AND HE WAS GLAD. WE SEE IT, WE ARE GLAD ABOUT IT. IN 2016, COURAGEOUS BLACK PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO COME FORWARD AND ANNOUNCE THEIR SUPPORT. WE SAW THE DAY OR EVERY FIVE PERSONS WOULD CRITICIZE US, ONE PERSON WOULD HEAR US. ONCE SOMEONE STEPS UP TO THE PLATE, OTHERS SAY THEY CAN STEP UP TO THE PLATE. YOU HAVE NOT SEEN NOTHING YET. WAIT UNTIL WE SEE THE HARVEST AND 2020 , IN 2020. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. A VERY SPECIAL THANKS TO SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN WITH US RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, KATRINA. ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE I MET. I SAID I'M THINKING ABOUT RUNNING AND SHE SAID IT WAS A GOOD IDEA AND I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE HERE WE ARE. GREAT JOB YOU HAVE DONE. AND A VERY SPECIAL WOMAN WHO IS CONSTANTLY DEFENDING ME [INDISCERNIBLE] WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED BY FORMER GOVERNOR SONNY PURDUE. HE HAS GIVEN AWAY A LOT OF THE MONEY FROM CHINA. HE IS THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND HE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE SENATOR DAVID PURDUE . WHERE IS HE? I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN SO INSTRUMENTAL. WHEN WE WERE CAMPAIGNING, GEORGIA WAS NOT DOING GOOD AND NOW IT IS DOING PHENOMENAL. WE WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR, BRIAN. THE STATE IS DOING MUCH BETTER THAN IT WAS. BRIAN KEMP, A LOT BETTER. YOU ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND WE HAVE A COUPLE OF WARRIORS THAT ARE INCREDIBLE AND HAVE BEEN REP FROM THE BEGINNING. THEY HELP US WITH ALL THE WITCHHUNTS. WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVE RICK ALLEN. REPRESENTATIVE, MEANING CONGRESSMAN BARNEY CARTER. JODY HEISE, YOU KNOW. AND A WARRIOR LIKE THE PEOPLE HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE. I WATCHED HIM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE VERY NERVOUS WHEN HE STARTED GOING AFTER EVERYONE. SHE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE AND HE'S ALSO A SPECIAL MAN, CONGRESSMAN DOUG COLLINS. GREAT JOB. THANK YOU. WE ALSO HAVE A FIRST LADY AT THIS. YOU HAVE A FIRST LADY IN JORDAN , GEORGIA NAMED MARTY CAMP , KEMP. LIFE IS NOT SO EASY FOR BRIAN, HE IS WORKING ALL THE TIME. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JEFF DUNCAN, FORMER TOUR OF PLAYER BY THE WAY. ATTORNEY GENERAL CHRIS CARR, THANKS. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ELECTIVE OF KENTUCKY IS HERE. WE HAD A GREAT KENTUCKY, BUT GOT NO CREDIT FOR IT. REALLY WORKS HARD AND , WORK HARD AND ALMOST ONE. WE BROUGHT HIM UP 19 POINTS IN THE MEDIA SAID THAT WAS A BAD NIGHT FOR TRUMP. WE WON FIVE OF THE SIX RACES. THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR KENTUCKY. DANIEL, HE WON BY A LOT. A LOT OF FUN FROM THE NET BEFORE. YOU SET A RECORD FOR WHAT YOU ARE RUNNING FOR. WHEN I RAN FOR OFFICE THREE YEARS AGO, I LOOKED AT THE FISCAL RECORD OF THE DEMOCRATS AND ASKED THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? I CAME OFF THE STAGE AND THEY SAY I DON'T THINK THEY ARE GOING TO LIKE THAT. I SAID I READ A LIST. LAST IN THE ECONOMY, LAST IN WAGES, [INAUDIBLE] I HATE TO SAY THIS, I DO MY WORST WORK OFF SCRIPT AND I DO MY BEST OFF SCRIPT AND IT MAKES THINGS EXCITING. IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT STATEMENT TO BE MADE. THEN I MADE YOU A PLEDGE THAT WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR ME OR NOT, I WOULD BE YOUR GREATEST CHAMPION AND YOU DID. YOU CAME OUT, WE DID VERY WELL. I CAME NOT AS A POLITICIAN. I CAME AS A BUSINESSMAN /TELEVISION STAR. WE HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH THE APPRENTICE AND I SAID WE ARE GOING TO DO A JOB. I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT. THEY SEE WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH JUDGES. WE HAVE PICKED 157 AND WILL BE AT 180 SOON. I SAID HOW MANY, THEY SAID 142. TWO GREAT SUPREME COURT JUDGES. TO CREATE , TWO GREAT JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT AND WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT WHOLE SITUATION WITH JUDGES BECAUSE WE'VE A LOT COMING. THERE ARE SOME SAYING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU DO, I SAY MILITARY AND DEFENSE. WE HAVE TOTALLY REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE DID A BIG NUMBER ON THE GOT IT LAST WEEK , AL-BAGHDADI LAST WEEK. THEY WERE PLAYING GAMES , THEY WEREN'T PLAYING GAMES. THEY DID NOT GO THROUGH THE DOOR. I'M WATCHING THIS LIKE YOU WATCH A MOVIE AND THEY BOOM, BOOM. I SAID WHY DON'T THEY WALKED THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR? THEY SAID BOOBY-TRAPS. IT MAKES SENSE. HE KILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE. HE WAS THE FOUNDER OF ISIS. THEN WE TOOK OUT HIS SECOND AND WE HAVE OUR EYES ON HIS THIRD. I VOW TO FIGHT FOR YOUR FAMILIES AND YOUR FUTURE. EVER SINGLE ONE WAS THE WORST. THEY HAD STATISTICS SAYING THIS IS BAD AND WE TOOK CARE OF IT. NIGHT HAVE SOME OF THE BEST NUMBERS YOU HAVE. FOR DECADES, DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS FOR GRANTED. I THINK 100 YEARS. WHEN DETROIT LAST HAD A REPUBLICAN MAYOR IN 1962, IT HAD A STRONG, BEAUTIFUL ECONOMY AND AFTERNOON OF THE 60 YEARS OF CROOKED DEMOCRATIC RULE, IT IS ONE OF THE POOR CITIES IN AMERICA. IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL CITIES IN AMERICA. PHILADELPHIA, THE POVERTY RATE DOUBLED. THE CITY HAS HAD A DEMOCRAT MAYOR EVERY YEAR SINCE 1952. NATIONWIDE, 58% OF MURDER VICTIMS UNDER THE AGE OF 22 ARE AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THEY WANT YOUR VOTE THEN FORGET ABOUT YOU FOR FOUR YEARS, SIX YEARS, TWO YEARS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE. IDEA WITH THEM ALL THE TIME. THIS GUY ADAM SCHIFF, HE IS A CROOKED POLITICIAN. NANCY PELOSI GO BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS. OF ALL THE WASHINGTON SELLOUT THAT HAVE BOARDED , THAT HAVE WOUNDED. THE BETRAYAL OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS UNBELIEVABLE. DEMOCRATS VOWED TO DEFEAT OF SPECIAL INTEREST AND SCHOOLS, THERE WERE SCHOOLS OF ANYBODY IN THE COUNTRY BY FAR. IT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE. THEY SHIPPED YOUR JOBS OVERSEAS, HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS. WE CANNOT GET NANCY PELOSI TO APPROVE YOU MCA , UMCA. DEMOCRATS OPENED BORDERS TO RUTHLESS GANGS, MASS IMMIGRATION WAS HURTS , WHICH HURTS THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THEY PASSED CRIME BILLS THAT HURT YOUR COMMUNITY. IT IS AMAZING THAT YOU HAVE STAYED SO [INDISCERNIBLE] TO BE HONEST. NOBODY KNOWS WHY. UNDER THIS IN MINISTRATION, ALL OF THAT HAS CHANGED AND IT IS CHANGING EVEN FASTER. WE ARE DOING , UNDOING THE DAMAGE INFLICTED BY DEMOCRAT RULE IN CREATING NEW PROSPERITY. WE HAVE DONE MORE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THREE YEARS THAN THE BROKEN WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT HAS DONE IN MORE THAN 30 YEARS. WE HAVE CREATED 6.7 MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION, A NUMBER THAT IF I WOULD'VE SAID TO THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. IF I SAID THAT DURING THE CAMPAIGN, I WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCORIATED. LAST MONTH, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. HOW DO YOU LOSE THAT ARGUMENT IN A DEBATE? THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT, IT WAS 60%, 70%, HAS NOW REACHED THE LOWEST NUMBER EVER RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY RATE HAS REACHED AN ALL-TIME HISTORIC LOW. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, MOST NEW HIRES ARE MINORITIES AND WOMEN. WAGES ARE RISING REALLY FAST, UP 9% SINCE THE ELECTION, A NUMBER THAT WAS UNTHINKABLE IN THEIR RISING FASTEST FOR LOW INCOME WORKERS. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS WOULD HAPPEN? ALMOST 2.5 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY INCLUDING 150,000 AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN. THAT IS A LOT. WHEN I HEAR 150,000, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. IT MEANS WE FILL THE YANKEE STADIUM THREE TIMES. WE HAVE CUT A RECORD NUMBER OF JOB DESTROYING REGULATIONS AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A SHORT WHILE, WE PASSED A MASSIVE TAX CUTS, SAVING THE TYPICAL FAMILY $2000 YEAR AND MY ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED MORE THAN $8 BILLION IN CONTRACTS AND FINANCING TO MINORITY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH HAVE , HAS RESULTED IN 20,000 BRAND-NEW BEAUTIFUL JOBS. WITH US TODAY OUR CALPINE ENGINEER LOOKING , KELVIN KING. HE'S A GRADUATE OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMY WHERE HE WAS ALSO AN ALL-CONFERENCE FOOTBALL PLAYER. TODAY, THEY OWN A GENERAL CONTRACTING BUSINESS. PLEASE COME UP AND SAY A FEW WORDS. HE LOOKS SO HAPPY. HE SHOULD BE. THANK YOU. ONLY 80 ONLY 80 SECONDS. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. THIS IS REALLY COOL OTHER WAY. I AM A BUILDER. WE OWN A CONSTRUCTION FIRM HERE IN AS A BUSINESSMAN I STARTED IT SEVEN YEARS AGO OUT OF MY BEDROOM AND WE WERE ABLE TO GENERATE ENOUGH CASH TO MOVE TO THE BASEMENT AND WE OPERATED OUT OF MY BASEMENT FOR A FEW YEARS, BUT JUST LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO PURCHASE AND OPERATE OUR VERY OWN FROM THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT OFFICE BUILDING OVER NEAR THE BRAVES STADIUM. BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES OF THIS PRESIDENT, THE ECONOMY IS THE STRONGEST OF MY LIFETIME. MAYBE TOO LONG TO CONSIDER HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND EMPLOYEES. WE ARE HIRING. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS RELIES ON HER ABILITY TO IGNORE THE DISTRACTIONS WE SEE ON A DAILY BASIS. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE POLICIES, DON'T SIT ON THE SIDELINES. YOU GET IN THE GAME AND AS AN AIR FORCE VETERAN, I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF YOUR UPGRADE OF THE BA HEALTH SYSTEM , THE V.A. HEALTH SYSTEM. IN THE WORDS OF A TUSKEGEE AIRMEN, THE PRIVILEGES OF BEING AN AMERICAN BELONGS TO THOSE BRAVE ENOUGH TO FIGHT FOR THEM. THANK YOU FOR BEING BRAVE, THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE BLACK COMMUNITY A PRIORITY AND THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING FOR ALL AMERICANS. YOU WILL GET OUR VOTE IN 2020. THANK YOU. THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EVERY DAY WE ARE REVERSING TRADE POLICIES THAT HAVE SHATTERED BLACK MIDDLE-CLASS CITIZENS. [NO AUDIO] ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS HELD BY AFRICAN-AMERICANS WERE TOTALLY GONE. IN THE LAST THREE DECADES, 27% OF ALL MANUFACTURING JOBS, PHILADELPHIA LOST 74%, BUT THE DAYS OF SHIPPING AMERICAN JOBS OVERSEAS IS OVER. 10,000 PLANTS ARE BEING OPENED IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE WE TOOK OVER. ON BEHALF OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN ALL AMERICANS, WE ARE NOW PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. WE ARE STANDING UP TO ABUSES AND REPLACING THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE, A GIANT VICTORY FOR FARMERS AND MANUFACTURERS FROM COAST-TO-COAST. THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS HAVE COME UP WITH THAT NAME. I DON'T THINK , THEY GO LET'S IMPEACH HIM, LET'S , WE CAN'T BE HIM, SO LET'S IMPEACH HIM. GOOD IDEA. THE DO-NOTHING DEMOCRATS ARE BLOCKING THE VOTE ON THE USMCA. THEY WOULD RATHER HURT THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS BEEN HURT , HELP BLACK CONSTITUENTS. WE HAVE ADDED NEARLY 10,000 NEW FACTORIES IN THREE YEARS AND WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED WILL STOP EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE IN THE USA. WE ARE THE HOT PLACE WITH THE HOTTEST ECONOMY BY FAR ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. TO KEEP JOBS IN AMERICA, I WITHDREW FROM THE HARRIS CLIMATE ACCORD. DEMOCRATS WANTED TO INVEST IN PROJECTS AND I WANTED TO INVEST IN BLACK AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. SO TRUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEY ALL GO BACK, SEE HE WANTS TO BE A DICTATOR. THESE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. WE CREATED 9000 OPPORTUNITIES, SOUTH CAROLINA WAS INCREDIBLE. 8 MILLION AFRICAN-AMERICANS LIVE IN OPPORTUNITIES THAT EVERY DEMOCRATS VOTED AGAINST. THE REPUBLICANS GOT IT PASSED, NOT EASY. WE HAD NO VOTES FROM DEMOCRATS AND NOW DEMOCRATS SAY WE HAVE MADE A MISTAKE AND THEY WILL NEVER ADMIT THAT PUBLICLY. I SAID TIM SCOTT , TIM SCOTT YOUR SENATORS WERE INCREDIBLE. IT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. NOBODY EVER THOUGHT THAT COULD HAPPEN TO THE EXTENT IT HAS HAPPENED, TO DRAW INVESTMENT TO THESE COMMUNITIES, WE SLASHED THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX TO ZERO BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE COMING IN WITH IRIS MONEY AND NOW THEY ARE THRILLED TO COME IN WITH MORE. PROPERTY VALUES HAVE SKYROCKETED AND VALUES ARE UP 20%, 30%. WE ARE PROUD TO BE JOINED BY AN ARMY VETERAN AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. HE IS BUILDING A NEW CONCRETE PLAN TO SUPPORT THE FUTURE HOME OF THE BRAND-NEW F-35 FIGHTER JETS AND I WILL BE IN ALABAMA TOMORROW WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME. THAT WILL BE A GOOD GAME I THINK WILL STOP , GOOD GAME I THINK. COME ON UP AND SAY A FEW WORDS. I CAME READY FOR THIS ONE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT CLEAR. I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. I'M JUST A REGULAR HUMAN BEING FROM ALABAMA AND I'M GOING TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT I GOT A DEGREE IN ALABAMA. I AM STANDING ON THE SAME STAGE AS DONALD TRUMP. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. RIGHT BEHIND US, THE STARS & STRIPES, THE AMERICAN FLAG. I THINK GOD TODAY THAT WE ARE ONE NATION. WHAT IT STANDS FOR IS SOUTH DADE AIR CONDITIONING. IT IS OUT OF HOMESTEAD, FLORIDA AND ORIGINATED BACK IN 1987. WE BECAME KNOWN AND THEN I FOUND A REASON TO BECOME A WAR FIGHTER , SO BACK IN 2009, WE WENT ON AND CREATED A LOT OF JOBS AND THEN THE RECESSION HIT. IT GOT EVERYBODY, BUT I FOUND MYSELF IN DEBT OVER ONE MILLION SOMETHING. THERE IS A REASON THAT GOD DO WHAT HE DO. WHEN I GOT THERE, I MET A FOOTBALL PLAYER, AND AUBURN FOOTBALL PLAYER , AN AUBURN FOOTBALL PLAYER. WE DID SOME THINGS IN ALABAMA THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. I KNOW HE WILL PROBABLY BE ME UP, BUT HE IS ONE OF THE GRANDSONS, ONE OF THE FIREFIGHTERS THAT HAD HOLES BACK IN HIS HAND BACK IN 1965 AND WE CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY. BY MEETING WITH HIM, I WAS ABLE TO BRIDGE THAT GAP DOWN TO A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT. CAME HERE AND MET WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. CAN'T COUNT THEM OUT OUT, SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT STAGE. WE HAVE FOUND A NEW ERA. FOUND A NEW ERA. THEY HAVE CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY ZONE. [NO AUDIO] YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE COMING TO VISIT. EVERYONE WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE PRESENT OF THE UNITED STATES COMING AND IT HAPPENED THAT AFTER THEY GOT THERE, HE WAS IMPRESSED BY WHAT WE WERE DOING ALREADY IN THE BUSINESSES WE CREATED. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL. WE HAVE A NEW PLOT IN A NEW OPPORTUNITY ZONE. TALKING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RESOURCES THAT BECAME AVAILABLE. GENERALLY, ONE OF HIS TEAMS CAME DOWN AND WE HAD A 100% GROWTH PATTERN OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS , PARTICULARLY NOW WE WILL HAVE A 200% GROWTH THE NEXT 18 MONTHS. THIS IS THE NEW ERA FOR THIS NEW VISION AND I CAN SAY HELLO TO THIS AUDIENCE AND THIS NATION. WHILE I'M GOT A YEAR, I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THE STATE OF THE [INDISCERNIBLE] BUT I KNOW IT IS STRONG. IN MY CLOSING, I WILL SAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES PRESENT, MR. DONALD TRUMP. GOD BLESS SDAC IN THE NEW JOBS WE ARE ABOUT TO CREATE AND SOMEWHAT, ALABAMA , IN JOB. , WHAT A JOB. HE IS DOING SO WELL IN THE CONCRETE BUSINESS, I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO BE A POLITICIAN POLITICIAN WHAT A GREAT JOB. AFTER MY ELECTION, I HEARD FROM COUNTLESS AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS. THEY ASKED ME TO GET INVOLVED IN A CAUSE THAT IS DEAR TO MANY OF THEM. IN THIS ROOM, I SEE SO MANY OF YOU, FOR WHOM IT WAS SO IMPORTANT, THAT IS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. LAST YEAR, WITH THE HELP OF JARED. STAND UP. HE WAS INCREDIBLE. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT FOR MANY YEARS, THEY NEVER CAME CLOSE. INCLUDING THE LAST ADMINISTRATION. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY TRIED. THEY DIDN'T EVEN TRY. THEY KNEW THEY WEREN'T GOING TO TRY BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO GET IT. WE NEED TO ROLLBACK THE UNJUST PROVISIONS OF THE 1994 CLINTON CRIME LAW, WHICH WAS SO UNFAIR TO YOUR COMMUNITY. WHICH SEVERELY AND DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE'RE ARE ALSO ADVANCING SECOND CHANCE HIRING TO GET REHABILITATED CITIZENS WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD BACK TO THE JOB. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE GOING FOR US. THE ECONOMY IS SO GOOD WE ARE GIVING CHANCES TODAY THAT YEARS AGO, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE. PEOPLE ARE SO HAPPY. EMPLOYERS, PEOPLE THAT PAY THE CHECK EVERY WEEK. THEY ARE SO HAPPY WITH THE RESULT. THEY CANNOT BELIEVE IT. THEY LISTED AS AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE IT HAS BEEN FOR 30 YEARS, WHY HAVEN'T WE BEEN DOING THIS. WE SAY HIGHER AMERICAN, WE MEAN HIGHER ALL AMERICANS. , HIGER , HIRE AMERICAN, WE MEAN HIRE ALL AMERICANS. THE LAST TWO YEARS, MURDERS IN AMERICA'S MAJOR CITIES HAVE DROPPED BY MORE THAN 10%. TO PROTECT THE CHURCH ROLE OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, WE INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR HBCUS BY OVER $100 MILLION. [APPLAUSE] THEY DO A GREAT JOB. SOME NEEDED SOME HELP. THEY DO A GREAT JOB. WE CAN'T LOSE THEM. WE ARE DELIVERING RESULTS FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THE HARD LEFT OF REGRETS HAVE BEEN DOING NOTHING FOR YEARS. FOR THREE STRAIGHT YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN OBSESSED WITH ONE GOAL, OVERTURNING THE VOTES OF THE 2016 RIGGED ELECTION THAT WE HAD. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, OVERTURNING IN AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. FIRST IT WAS THE RUSSIA HOAX. THAT WAS THE MUELLER REPORT. THE BIGGEST LIE EVER PERPETRATED AMONG THE , UPON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. RUSSIA, GIVE ME A BREAK. IT FELT BETTER BECAUSE I SAW THEM TWO WEEKS AGO, HILLARY CLINTON SAID, THAT JILL STEIN, THE HEAD OF THE GREEN PARTY, THAT WILL SEE GABBARD, I DON'T KNOW HER, BUT THEY SAID THEY WERE RUSSIAN OPERATIVES. THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED WITH RUSSIA. I DON'T KNOW EITHER OF THESE WOMEN, BUT I KNOW THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED WITH RUSSIA. WHEN THEY SAID IT ABOUT ME, IT ME TOO USED TO GET OUT OF IT. IT WITHIN TWO MINUTES. PEOPLE SAID, WE THINK SHE IS NUTS. DERANGED, HYPER PARTISAN IMPEACHMENT WITCHHUNT, A SINISTER EFFORT TO NULLIFY THE BALANCE OF 63 MILLION PATRIOTIC AMERICANS. IT'S ALL A HOAX. DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING TO DESTROY THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR SOCIETY. AND THE PILLARS OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND JUDICIAL SYSTEM. IN THEIR CRAVEN PURSUIT OF POWER AND MONEY. IMAGINE IF DEMOCRATS PUT 10% OF THE ENERGY THEY DEVOTE TO ATTACKING ME AND MY ADMINISTRATION, TO INSTEAD MAKING THIS A BETTER COUNTRY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN CITIZENS. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THEY COULD DO? THEY DON'T CARE, BUT WE DO. THAT'S REALLY THE TRUTH. I THINK YOU ARE LEARNING THAT QUICKLY. WITH REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS, WE ARE FIGHTING FOR SCHOOL CHOICE. WE BELIEVE IN AMERICA, NO. SHOULD EVER BE FORCED TO SEND THEIR CHILD OUT THE DOOR, TO A FAILING GOVERNMENT SCHOOL. IT SHOULD HAPPEN. THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. , SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. THEY ONLY WANT TO USE RADICAL SOCIALISM AND THEY WANT TO OPEN BORDERS SO ANYONE CAN COME IN. THEY HAVE BAD PEOPLE WANTING TO COME IN. WE HAVE STRENGTHENED THE BORDERS. WE NEED VOTES TO GET RID OF LOOPHOLES. THEY ARE CALLED LOOPHOLES. DEMOCRATS WANT TO GIVE FREE HEALTH CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS, COURTESY OF YOU, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE PUBLIC BENEFITS SHOULD BE PROTECTED FOR AMERICANS. FOR THE MONEY WE SPENT ON ILLEGAL ALIENS, WE COULD REBUILD OUR ADVERSITIES , OUR INNER CITIES, FIX OUR TERRIBLE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. INSTEAD, DEMOCRATS WANT TO REDISTRIBUTE YOUR WEALTH ALL OVER THE WORLD, TO PLACES YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF. EVERY DAY, DEMOCRAT SANCTUARY CITIES ARE RELEASING DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS AND GANG MEMBERS LIKE MS 13 ONTO YOUR STREETS. PUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR CITIES SHOULD BE SANCTUARIES FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT CRIMINAL ALIENS. LAST YEAR, DEMOCRATS EVEN SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT, TO PRESERVE BENEFITS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, NEVER HAVE THEY FOUGHT THAT HARD TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THEY DON'T FIGHT THAT WAY. I SEE THEM. I AM WITH THEM. THEY DON'T FIGHT FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE THE LEGAL ALIENS COME IN, HEALTH CARE, SCHOOLS, I JOKINGLY SAID ONCE, ROLLS-ROYCE IS, EVERY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT GETS AN , A ROLLS-ROYCE. THE MEDIA SAID THEY ALL GET ROLLS-ROYCE'S. THIS IS A LIE. THESE PEOPLE ARE THE WORST. THEY DON'T GIVE THEM ROLLS-ROYCE'S. THEY GIVE THEM JUST SHORT OF THAT. DEMOCRATS CARE MORE ABOUT ILLEGAL ALIENS THAN AFRICAN-AMERICAN CITIZENS OR OUR MILITARY. OR CITIZENS ALL OVER. THEY CARE MORE, AFRICAN-AMERICANS BECOME , CARE MORE , AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE BECOME FORGOTTEN AMERICANS. UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. THEY ARE FORGOTTEN NO LONGER. RADICAL DEMOCRATS ARE WAGING AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT ON HISTORIC VALUES AND TRADITIONS OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THEY ARE TRYING TO ATTACK LAW ENFORCEMENT ERRORS THAT KEEP US SAFE. THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING SAFE. WE WANT SAFETY. WHEN I READ THE LIST OF 10, 1 OF THE LIST WAS THAT IS THE MOST UNSAFE, AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. THE NUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT. LIKE HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE. WE WANT TO BE SAFE. THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE, CRUSHER RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND SILENCER PASTORS. PASTORS ARE BEING SILENCE. NOT ANY LONGER, BECAUSE OF THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO YOU NOW. YOU'RE PASTORS AND MINISTERS ARE ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO YOU NOW. WITHOUT RETRIBUTION. AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHURCHES HAVE BEEN LIFTED UP. THEY HAVE BEEN THE CONSCIENCE OF OUR NATION. DEMOCRATS WANT TO DRIVE FAITH OUT OF THE PUBLIC SQUARE AND ATTACKED CHRISTIANS AND OTHER RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THEY HAVE GONE CRAZY. AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL ALWAYS CHERISH OUR NATIONS RELIGIOUS HERITAGE. WE WILL ALWAYS CHERISH THAT. IT MEANS SO MUCH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. A LOT OF IT IS BECAUSE THEY LOST THAT INCREDIBLE GROUNDING. THE VITAL AND INDISPENSABLE ROLE OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHURCHES AND OUR SITE , SOCIETY. WE HAVE SOME MINISTERS HERE AND PASTORS HERE. YOU HEARD FROM ONE, HE IS AN INCREDIBLE MAN. WE HAVE MINISTERS AND PASTORS AND OTHERS THAT ARE PEOPLE THAT WE ALL LOOK UP TO WHEN THEIR VOICE HAS TO BE HEARD. THEY HAVE TO BE HEARD. THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE THAT VOICE AWAY. IT WON'T HAPPEN. DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH. EVERY TOP DEMOCRAT ALSO SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION. RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, WHERE IT WAS AFTER BIRTH. THAT'S EVIL. THAT'S WHY I HAVE ASKED CONGRESS TO STOP LATE-TERM ABORTION, BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT. THROUGH HEAVY AFRICAN-AMERICAN ACROSS OUR LAND, YOU DON'T NOT CHOOSE TO LEAVE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ALREADY LEFT YOU ALONG. , A LONG TIME AGO. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE RADICAL SOCIALISM, OPEN BORDERS, OUT-OF-CONTROL POLITICAL CORRECTNESS, YOUR JOBS GOING OVERSEAS, YOUR CHILDREN TRAPPED IN FAILING SCHOOLS, LIBERAL EXTREMISTS TO RUN YOUR LIVES, THEN TODAY, THEY SAY WELCOME TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. HONEST ABE. REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF LINCOLN AND FREDERICK DOUGLASS. THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND HARD-WORKING AMERICAN PATRIOTS OF EVERY RACE, RELIGION, COLOR AND CREED. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY KNOWS OUR RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND FREEDOMS , LIBERTIES AND FREEDOMS ARE GIVEN TO US BY THE HAND OF GOD. GUIDED BY THAT OF TRUTH, DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING FOR , PUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING FOR SAFE STREETS, AND A GOVERNMENT THAT LISTENS AND ENTERS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

CSPANMP2011201969	Mike Pence	2019-11-20	Vice President Pence Remarks in Green Bay, Wisconsin	Speech	Thank you all for that warm welcome and. Join me in thanking our brand new secretary of labor Eugene Scalia he is fighting for American workers and American jobs every day. Really is great to be with all of you today and with some great public servants especially my great friend a great ally of this administration Congressman Mike Gallagher thank you for your leadership. And for your service to this country. But to Mayor Steve And especially Daria to stay Jan Allman and standing here before the bow Of the future u.s.s. marionette it is great to be here with all the extraordinary men and women who have been the heart of this city since 944 let's hear it for them Aaron Emery. Wow. I've got to tell you I got a chance to walk on that ship a few minutes ago and the handy work the craftsmanship that's already been at sea for generations across America it's been produced in the shipyards truly extraordinary and it really is an honor to be with all of you also an honor to be here with so many other hardworking Americans people from across the state neighbors and friends just had a warm welcome as we drove through town the entire school at Garfield elementary came out on the curb and I just had to pull over. It was great. I do appreciate the warm welcome I even got a letter when we had to reschedule this event I got a letter from a 4th generation business owner in this community she looked one looked at me and she knew that I liked cheese so join me in thanking care Okubo canny of Joe's cheese House Carol. I'm counting on you. letter and tell me I'll bring you some cheese Carol thank you so much and congratulations on all your family success for so long it's great great to be here and it is great to be back in the Badger State it really is and as I began to allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine. When I told him yesterday that I was headed to Wisconsin I think he sounded just a little bit jealous so let me bring greetings from a man who loves the state of Wisconsin and is fighting every day to keep the promises that he made to the Badger State I bring greetings. From the 45th president of the United States of America President Donald Trump. There really is a privilege. It's a privilege for this Midwesterner to be back in the heartland of America but also to be here to be here on the president's behalf with a company that's creating so many opportunities for generations now only for people in this city even in Wisconsin but really all across all across this region it's remarkable the thing that Fink of Terry's investment here in Marin met started with just a handful of workers and a contract to build 5 wooden barges for the United States Navy during World War 2. It's amazing but since then because of the skill and craftsmanship of the people of this community Terry Maronite Marine has designed and built more than 1500 naval vessels and they're some of the finest at sea in the world. And as a result of your professionalism in the reputation of this great company you doubled your workforce in just the last decade created more than 200 good paying American jobs this year and today think of the marionette Marina's created a total of more than $1500.00 good paying American jobs and I got a bit of an announcement I learned on the way here if there's any Wisconsinites or even Mission ganders that are out there looking for work think it Terry is hiring right here in Marin at. That Work. This is a growing economy and a growing state a growing nation and it's remarkable to. I think remarkable to think that it's only going to continue because I'm told that if a man is planning another $100000000.00 investment right here in Marionet. Creating 700 new jobs right here in the heart of the heartland. Walk. And you know you know just creating jobs in America and you're also supporting thousands of jobs throughout the supply chain of this company and it's this company probably says your ships are not only made in Wisconsin by American workers but they're made with American steel 97 percent. 97 percent of all the steel and aluminum that used to yours made in the USA and I got to tell you it is music to my ears and I know to be music to the years of the president and we're catching up later today and you're not just supporting American manufacturing I'm especially grateful for the role that all of you play in the 1st priority of our national going. And am am has played a critical role in the national defense of the United States of America for generations Your handiwork here makes it possible for our Navy to sail the 7 seas and defend this nation stand with our allies you've been supporting our men and women but you're also building here at home I'm actually told that this shipyard alone employs more than 100 men and women who serve in the uniform of the United States with all the veterans who are with us today just raise your hand and give us one more chance to say thank you for your service. Thank you. Thank you. And I got to think I got to think those are serve in uniform feel like you're still serving because what you do here which you build here is all of vital part of our ability to defend this nation since that very 1st contract one day on day 177 years ago I think Terry has worked with our armed forces I'm told to make ships like ice breakers mine countermeasure visitors vessels ocean tug boats and as I just walked around the littoral combat ships and l.c.s. made right here in Marin net Wisconsin you all ought to be proud that's an incredible ship in the to and I and I was actually told it even got a little bit of an Indiana connection there that in fact I'm told the ship u.s.s. Indianapolis was Commission last month back in the Hoosier states of thanks for building Indianapolis right here in Marin and. So on behalf of our Commander in Chief thank you for your contributions not just this community state. You are growing economy and of course to your families but thank you for your contributions to the defense of this nation every day but I'm also here because we've got a great opportunity before us for all the tapping across this country we've made incredible progress I mean at you when you think about the leadership the president Donald Thas brought across this nation I think there's only one way you can describe the last 3 years it's been 3 years of action. It's been 3 years of results. It's been 3 years of promises made and promises kept but we're just getting started Marin that we're going to keep growing strong. Think about. Think about when this president promised to rebuild our military restore the arsenal of democracy and after years of reckless budget cutbacks that I'm sure you felt here in this community President Donald Trump deliver this president has actually already signed twice the largest increases in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan including the largest pay raise for our men and women in uniform in more than 10 years. As president I say our active duty personnel are now the best equipped best trained most technologically advanced fighting force in the history the war and we reminded the world of that just a few short weeks ago didn't wait when the United States Special Forces descended on a compound in north Syria and took out the leader of ISIS without one American cash. About. About. And you'll be glad no one really knew this year the president also proposed will be by far the largest defense budget in American history $750000000000.00 to make the strongest fighting force in the history of the world stronger Still it would fund an end strength of more than $2000000.00 active and reserve military personnel president's budget also modernize our armored brigade to provide resources for 12 battle force ships 2 large on manned surface ships 110 fighter aircraft. The budget also includes the largest ship building budget request for the United States Navy in 20 years. Back. As we stand here at the only shipyard on the Great Lakes that builds ships for the United States Navy I'm proud to report to all of you that we are well on our way to the 350 shift Navy the president promised to the American people and you're going to build a lot of it right here in America. Back where nearly 300 ships are growing right now thanks in large part to all of you the Navy's And I'm told 35 of those LCs ships like the one just behind me to keep up the great work keep delivering and know that as you put your hands on these ships you're really. You're really crafting the means for America's finest to defend this nation and I know you continue to do it with the care in the concern and the dedication of the people of if and delivered for generations the truth is we made great progress in strengthening our national defense of the last 3 years. But the people of Wisconsin deserve to know. That things are getting a little tied up in Washington these days. While Democrats in Congress continue to spend all their time on endless investigations in a partisan impeachment. They have been able to find time to fund our national defense or give us the increases that President Trump knows we need. To really encroach. Furby thing that's happening in Washington d.c. the disgrace is also what's not happening in Washington d.c. as you know Congress just delayed again a $20000000000.00 increase in our national defense and because they failed to pass a defense bill this week. They had to pass a resolution they had to pass a resolution that would. That would make the Department of Defense delay new acquisition programs this year and potentially Force the Navy to sideline 14 ships that need repairs. And there's real consequences to what's going on in Washington d.c.. While they continue their politics as usual. It's having a real impact on the life of the nation and our national defense. Well I think the American people deserve better and it's time for Congress to put politics aside do their job and fund our national defense at the level that the American people. I make you proud. Whatever Democrats in Congress want to spend their time on President Trump and are going to keep on fighting. And we're going to keep on delivering with all of your help and skill we're going to keep on giving our soldiers our sailors our airman our Marines and our Coast Guard the resources and the equipment they need to accomplish their mission and defend this nation so help us God. So we've rebuilt our military you all have played a key role in them but you're also far been incredible economic success story this president said not only said we can restore the arsenal of democracy stand tall in the world again stand with our allies stand up to our enemies but he also said we could revive the American economy when he and I were campaigning across Wisconsin 3 years ago this economy had grown by more than 2 percent for the last 8 years and people were saying that was the new normal the president Donald Trump knew better president Donald Trump live right out of the gate in our 1st year we cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses just like this we rolled back more federal red tape in this administration than any administration in American history we've unleashed American energy we're now going to be a net exporter of oil and natural gas for the 1st time in 75 years and we fought for free and fair trade that puts American jobs and American workers 1st. And the results. And the results have been remarkable not like I got to telling you and since Election Day businesses large and small just like this one the growing all across this country 6700000 new jobs have been created across America including 100000 jobs in Wisconsin in Michigan alone missing Croom remember the last administration we had a president the White House who was asked what it was going to do to bring back manufacturing. I'm a little bit biased here you know I come from a state just like Wisconsin where we we do 2 things especially well we make things and we grow things right and we actually had a president in the summer of 2016 who said that manufacturing jobs 200000 jobs that have been lost would never be coming back to remember he was actually asked what he was going to do to bring manufacturing back and he said he says What do you have a magic wand. But we didn't need a magic wand. We just need a president Donald Trump in the White House 500000 manufacturing jobs are back. And roaring. Down coming back 25000 good paying manufacturing jobs right here Wisconsin it's not just been about manufacturing you know over all the unemployment rates at a 50 year low here in Wisconsin is just 3.3 percent in fact right now the unemployment rate is below 5 percent in 48 states in this country and as I stand before you today 9 states 9 states across this country have the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded in just the last few months the unemployment rate for women hit a 65 year low and the unemployment rate for African-Americans and Hispanic Americans is the lowest level ever recorded the American dream is working for everybody and every American should be proud. You know it's not just been about more jobs it's been about better job. And since President Trump was elected the average American household has seen your disposable income go up by $5000.00 a year. Under the last administration the average American household lost $3000.00 a year in income and you all felt. And you're seeing how it's all how it's all improved and wages have been going up they're going up it's faster than they have in more than 10 years and they're rising most rapidly the president I couldn't be more proud wages today are rising most rapidly for hard working blue collar Americans the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. Thanks. And people know what. You all know when you see it in this great company I hear about it all over the country Karen and I slipped away for a long day and a half vacation about a few months ago. We went down to Sanibel Island Florida you ever heard of it it's right over there near Fort Myers Great Plains we were sitting out there on the beach true story had a ball caps on our sunglasses read a book trying to catch a little bit time on. And these 2 big boys came walking by both wearing Budweiser shirts man after my own heart. And they did one of them stopped and looked at me because a local newspaper it said that we were on the island. And one of the stop look to me said your pants aren't you. And I said yes or I am. And he said listen next time you see the president he said You tell him to keep doing what he's doing because I made twice as much money last years I made year before. And I said you know what I'm going to tell him that word for word and I did. And then he took 2 steps away turned back around and said and I don't know what you do the keep doing what you're doing to. And I told him I was. Very well known you know you feel the energy in this place you see a company grow you see a community thriving that's all. It's all happening for 2 reasons number one because you've got a president who understands. You've got on tired ministration great allies in Congress and understand what makes the most powerful free market economy in history the world work less taxes less regulation more low cost American energy better and fair trade deals and we've been fighting for me every day. But the truth of matter is President I also know the other half of the reason that America is prospering is because frankly the working men and women of America are the hardest working people in the world. Sure. Nobody can now work right nobody nobody cannot work the American worker and it's people like all of you gathered here that's why I'm really particularly excited to be here people I'm told like a lead ship builder here Marin I'm told he started here is a welder more than 40 years ago. He later became an electrician his son had followed in his footsteps and joined the company line like so many others that I've already met today and now this father and son are working side by side on the l.c.s. Minneapolis St Paul it's a great family effort contributing to this community contributing to the defense of this nation so would you join me in showing gratitude and appreciation for 44 years of service to Joseph Claiborne were you just. Words you saw right next to him around. Thank you. Great great family or I'm told there are the former Mariner Chief Police also in our midst he wore the badge for 30 years before joining this company as your security manager when he did he join nearly a dozen of his family members who were already here. Welders electricians and company spokeswoman it really was already a family affair but he brought his leadership skills his background his experience to come here and make sure that all you create here is properly secured and protected fact I'm told one of his daughters. Actually met her husband here. That's what we call a bonus. And they've now been married for 5 years and they've got a 3 year old son named Pearson join me in thanking Jeff score and the entire score family for their service to this community this company and this nation where are Really the Cleavers score. While skis and all the other families and Senate here are just emblematic of all of you the truth is what you've proved in this company. Is that when we level the playing field when we allow American businesses in American workers to compete we can compete and win against any workers anywhere in the world so give yourselves a round of applause Marron Amarin your proven it every day. I'm happy to report all of you about the promises kept by this president this administration and I want you all know that we recognize that it's thanks to all of you. And that leadership and support we've had from our allies in Congress at this country's prospering like never before and this president I promise you is committed to ensuring this prosperity reaches every American home but to do that we need to match the right jobs with the right workers in the skills in these companies also leading in that it's well it's remarkable to think that for more than a year and a half there have been more job openings in America then there are Americans looking for work I mean in fact there are 1000000 more job openings then there are unemployed Americans. It's extraordinary so workers in the skilled trades like so many of you here are in high demand it's true and that demand is only going to continue to grow as this economy is revived and is growing stronger by the day workers with your unique abilities and skills are going to be necessary to drive a growing American economy. And the truth is closing what the experts call the skills gap. Has to be job one and I promise you that you have a president and a vice president who believes that all honest work is honorable and we are working every single day to expand vocational education and vocational training for every American. We want to make sure. We want to make sure that every American has access to education they want to follow their dreams when I was governor of the state of Indiana I was reflecting on the fact that back back when I was coming out of high school in the 1970 s.. Things were different I'm sure they were in Wisconsin too right I mean there are some people here with hair the same colors mine right I mean when I when I went to high school there wasn't. We all came in in the school the same way some of us to turn left and go down the study a.p. English some a situation right and go down to industrial arts we ate the same cafeteria we cheered the same team we walked across the same stage and graduation day all right I mean but somewhere along the way it is true isn't it our high school got out of the business of offering education and training for every American on every pathway and I don't have to tell the people here at f m m what good paying jobs and great careers there her manufacture and that's why this president has taken decisive action to make vocational education and job training more accessible than ever before in our 1st year the president expanded apprenticeships and vocational training to help every American adapt to this changing and growing economy and last year we launched with the help of even this company something called the pledge to America's workers. To encourage businesses in every field to expand opportunities for training for American workers and American jobs by signing the pledge like this company do it companies committed to create training opportunities over the next 5 years for students for workers either through apprenticeship continuing education or on the job training now when the this is I'm really excited to tell you this when the pledge for America's workers was launched. Our 1st year goal was 500000 training opportunities in apprenticeships. But I got to be honest with you we didn't we didn't hit that number as I stand before you today more than 370 companies have pledged almost 15000000 training opportunities and apprenticeships for American workers. Let's call them they're promising and over deliver. And we're really just getting started I mean would you just give the great team here your c.e.o. again. Give them all I think it's here if a man has committed to 3000 apprenticeships and job training post right here in this company thank you so very much. And I want to thank you and g.m. and all of you for this incredible commitment to Wisconsin and Michigan for leading by example. The truth is you know there are people maybe looking on right now I mean there the literally tens of Americans that might be watching this on C-Span. Might be excited to hear you know what I go up to Wisconsin and there's companies up there that are ready to help me get the training so I can work on one of these and I can be a part of something really important not just for my family and for my community but for my nation those training opportunities we're going to have even more people that can fill this jobs in this growing economy here in Wisconsin will be more competitive on the world stage as well I mean the truth is under the president's leadership American workers are competing and winning with workers all over the world President Trump promised to work on making sure our economy had the conditions where companies and workers could grow and prosper but this president as I mentioned also promised to fight for trade deals that are free and fair and reciprocal President Donald Trump has delivered we negotiated a new trade deal with South Korea he signed 2 new trade agreements with Japan and we're working toward a free trade agreement with them and President Tput China on notice he said the era of economic surrender is over and China is at the negotiating table as we speak. So we've done a lot working on more when the u.k. finishes brix and we're going to work with them we're even talking to the European Union about a deal a closer to home there's a deal that's done that I want to ask for your help on before I slip away and catch a plane back to Indian. I don't know if you all know this but President when he campaigned through Wisconsin so that we can do better than NAFTA you know from the time NAFTA was signed in 1995 by President Bill Clinton we literally saw tens of thousands of factories close in this country and jobs open south of the border President Trump said we can do better we right out of the gate started in negotiations with our neighbors in Mexico and Canada and I'm going to tell you present a hard bargain. The man who wrote The Art of the deal one year ago closed the deal and the USMCA a is a win for Wisconsin workers and American jobs I promise you. And it's not just manufacturing I don't have tell your families concert about dairy I mean there's a lot you can go if your friends at work and dairy around here there's a lot going on up in Canada that was really working against the vitality of our dairy industry here in the upper Northwest present Trump stood Schroen with Prime Minister Trudeau held firm and we delivered we delivered for dairy we delivered a win for American agriculture now it's all good news u.s.m.c. has been down for a year but again one more example of something Congress apparently hasn't had time to get to. The midst of everything else they're doing the truth is Speaker Nancy Pelosi has had the u.s. m.c.a. on her desk for a year. She continues to say they're on a path to yes but the truth is Democrats in Congress have refused to bring it to the floor. Because I truly think if they bring it to the floor of the Congress it's going to hands it's going to be a win for Wisconsin and a win for American workers and I came here today to say The time has come for Democrats in Congress to put politics aside put America 1st and pass the u s m c a. Back. To make a difference in Wisconsin all across this country according to the i.t.c. this Mexico Canada agreement that we negotiated a year ago it's going to add about $70000000000.00 to our economy and create more than 175000 jobs including when it becomes law we predict that American manufacturing workers are going to get another raise his wages will continue to increase as exports expand in fact for Wisconsin the u.s.m.c. a becomes law in the United States will increase its exports of milk and cheese by 68000 tons. So we need to get this done with the last thing I just want to mention to you and I want to ask for you to get into because the truth is the clock is ticking. We all know there's a big presidential election coming next year and if you think Congress has a hard time getting anything done when it's not an election year just wait for an election year to come so the time has come for Congress to. To act and I want to encourage you here in Wisconsin to reach out to your members of Congress but let me let me save you a nickel you don't need to call Senator Ron Johnson because he's leading the charge for the u.s. m.c.a. in the United States Senate thank you Senator Johnson. And you also you also don't need to you don't need to call one of the rising stars in the Republican Congress 17 aeration Wisconsin I grew up in a small business family. Die hard Packers fan.

America. Thank you my. Thank you don't even call any of the Republicans members of Congress from Wisconsin because they're all in there standing with the president every single day on the u.s. and see it everything else but if you can then.

And for your service to this country. But to Mayor Steve And especially Daria to stay Jan Allman and standing here before the bow Of the future u.s.s. marionette it is great to be here with all the extraordinary men and women who have been the heart of this city since 944 let's hear it for them Aaron Emery. Wow. I've got to tell you I got a chance to walk on that ship a few minutes ago and the handy work the craftsmanship that's already been at sea for generations across America it's been produced in the shipyards truly extraordinary and it really is an honor to be with all of you also an honor to be here with so many other hardworking Americans people from across the state neighbors and friends just had a warm welcome as we drove through town the entire school at Garfield elementary came out on the curb and I just had to pull over. It was great. I do appreciate the warm welcome I even got a letter when we had to reschedule this event I got a letter from a 4th generation business owner in this community she looked one looked at me and she knew that I liked cheese so join me in thanking care Okubo canny of Joe's cheese House Carol. I'm counting on you. letter and tell me I'll bring you some cheese Carol thank you so much and congratulations on all your family success for so long it's great great to be here and it is great to be back in the Badger State it really is and as I began to allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine. When I told him yesterday that I was headed to Wisconsin I think he sounded just a little bit jealous so let me bring greetings from a man who loves the state of Wisconsin and is fighting every day to keep the promises that he made to the Badger State I bring greetings. From the 45th president of the United States of America President Donald Trump. There really is a privilege. It's a privilege for this Midwesterner to be back in the heartland of America but also to be here to be here on the president's behalf with a company that's creating so many opportunities for generations now only for people in this city even in Wisconsin but really all across all across this region it's remarkable the thing that Fink of Terry's investment here in Marin met started with just a handful of workers and a contract to build 5 wooden barges for the United States Navy during World War 2. It's amazing but since then because of the skill and craftsmanship of the people of this community Terry Maronite Marine has designed and built more than 1500 naval vessels and they're some of the finest at sea in the world. And as a result of your professionalism in the reputation of this great company you doubled your workforce in just the last decade created more than 200 good paying American jobs this year and today think of the marionette Marina's created a total of more than $1500.00 good paying American jobs and I got a bit of an announcement I learned on the way here if there's any Wisconsinites or even Mission ganders that are out there looking for work think it Terry is hiring right here in Marin at. That Work. This is a growing economy and a growing state a growing nation and it's remarkable to. I think remarkable to think that it's only going to continue because I'm told that if a man is planning another $100000000.00 investment right here in Marionet. Creating 700 new jobs right here in the heart of the heartland. Walk. And you know you know just creating jobs in America and you're also supporting thousands of jobs throughout the supply chain of this company and it's this company probably says your ships are not only made in Wisconsin by American workers but they're made with American steel 97 percent. 97 percent of all the steel and aluminum that used to yours made in the USA and I got to tell you it is music to my ears and I know to be music to the years of the president and we're catching up later today and you're not just supporting American manufacturing I'm especially grateful for the role that all of you play in the 1st priority of our national going. And am am has played a critical role in the national defense of the United States of America for generations Your handiwork here makes it possible for our Navy to sail the 7 seas and defend this nation stand with our allies you've been supporting our men and women but you're also building here at home I'm actually told that this shipyard alone employs more than 100 men and women who serve in the uniform of the United States with all the veterans who are with us today just raise your hand and give us one more chance to say thank you for your service. Thank you. Thank you. And I got to think I got to think those are serve in uniform feel like you're still serving because what you do here which you build here is all of vital part of our ability to defend this nation since that very 1st contract one day on day 177 years ago I think Terry has worked with our armed forces I'm told to make ships like ice breakers mine countermeasure visitors vessels ocean tug boats and as I just walked around the littoral combat ships and l.c.s. made right here in Marin net Wisconsin you all ought to be proud that's an incredible ship in the to and I and I was actually told it even got a little bit of an Indiana connection there that in fact I'm told the ship u.s.s. Indianapolis was Commission last month back in the Hoosier states of thanks for building Indianapolis right here in Marin and. So on behalf of our Commander in Chief thank you for your contributions not just this community state. You are growing economy and of course to your families but thank you for your contributions to the defense of this nation every day but I'm also here because we've got a great opportunity before us for all the tapping across this country we've made incredible progress I mean at you when you think about the leadership the president Donald Thas brought across this nation I think there's only one way you can describe the last 3 years it's been 3 years of action. It's been 3 years of results. It's been 3 years of promises made and promises kept but we're just getting started Marin that we're going to keep growing strong. Think about. Think about when this president promised to rebuild our military restore the arsenal of democracy and after years of reckless budget cutbacks that I'm sure you felt here in this community President Donald Trump deliver this president has actually already signed twice the largest increases in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan including the largest pay raise for our men and women in uniform in more than 10 years. As president I say our active duty personnel are now the best equipped best trained most technologically advanced fighting force in the history the war and we reminded the world of that just a few short weeks ago didn't wait when the United States Special Forces descended on a compound in north Syria and took out the leader of ISIS without one American cash. About. About. And you'll be glad no one really knew this year the president also proposed will be by far the largest defense budget in American history $750000000000.00 to make the strongest fighting force in the history of the world stronger Still it would fund an end strength of more than $2000000.00 active and reserve military personnel president's budget also modernize our armored brigade to provide resources for 12 battle force ships 2 large on manned surface ships 110 fighter aircraft. The budget also includes the largest ship building budget request for the United States Navy in 20 years. Back. As we stand here at the only shipyard on the Great Lakes that builds ships for the United States Navy I'm proud to report to all of you that we are well on our way to the 350 shift Navy the president promised to the American people and you're going to build a lot of it right here in America. Back where nearly 300 ships are growing right now thanks in large part to all of you the Navy's And I'm told 35 of those LCs ships like the one just behind me to keep up the great work keep delivering and know that as you put your hands on these ships you're really. You're really crafting the means for America's finest to defend this nation and I know you continue to do it with the care in the concern and the dedication of the people of if and delivered for generations the truth is we made great progress in strengthening our national defense of the last 3 years. But the people of Wisconsin deserve to know. That things are getting a little tied up in Washington these days. While Democrats in Congress continue to spend all their time on endless investigations in a partisan impeachment. They have been able to find time to fund our national defense or give us the increases that President Trump knows we need. To really encroach. Furby thing that's happening in Washington d.c. the disgrace is also what's not happening in Washington d.c. as you know Congress just delayed again a $20000000000.00 increase in our national defense and because they failed to pass a defense bill this week. They had to pass a resolution they had to pass a resolution that would. That would make the Department of Defense delay new acquisition programs this year and potentially Force the Navy to sideline 14 ships that need repairs. And there's real consequences to what's going on in Washington d.c.. While they continue their politics as usual. It's having a real impact on the life of the nation and our national defense. Well I think the American people deserve better and it's time for Congress to put politics aside do their job and fund our national defense at the level that the American people. I make you proud. Whatever Democrats in Congress want to spend their time on President Trump and are going to keep on fighting. And we're going to keep on delivering with all of your help and skill we're going to keep on giving our soldiers our sailors our airman our Marines and our Coast Guard the resources and the equipment they need to accomplish their mission and defend this nation so help us God. So we've rebuilt our military you all have played a key role in them but you're also far been incredible economic success story this president said not only said we can restore the arsenal of democracy stand tall in the world again stand with our allies stand up to our enemies but he also said we could revive the American economy when he and I were campaigning across Wisconsin 3 years ago this economy had grown by more than 2 percent for the last 8 years and people were saying that was the new normal the president Donald Trump knew better president Donald Trump live right out of the gate in our 1st year we cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses just like this we rolled back more federal red tape in this administration than any administration in American history we've unleashed American energy we're now going to be a net exporter of oil and natural gas for the 1st time in 75 years and we fought for free and fair trade that puts American jobs and American workers 1st. And the results. And the results have been remarkable not like I got to telling you and since Election Day businesses large and small just like this one the growing all across this country 6700000 new jobs have been created across America including 100000 jobs in Wisconsin in Michigan alone missing Croom remember the last administration we had a president the White House who was asked what it was going to do to bring back manufacturing. I'm a little bit biased here you know I come from a state just like Wisconsin where we we do 2 things especially well we make things and we grow things right and we actually had a president in the summer of 2016 who said that manufacturing jobs 200000 jobs that have been lost would never be coming back to remember he was actually asked what he was going to do to bring manufacturing back and he said he says What do you have a magic wand. But we didn't need a magic wand. We just need a president Donald Trump in the White House 500000 manufacturing jobs are back. And roaring. Down coming back 25000 good paying manufacturing jobs right here Wisconsin it's not just been about manufacturing you know over all the unemployment rates at a 50 year low here in Wisconsin is just 3.3 percent in fact right now the unemployment rate is below 5 percent in 48 states in this country and as I stand before you today 9 states 9 states across this country have the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded in just the last few months the unemployment rate for women hit a 65 year low and the unemployment rate for African-Americans and Hispanic Americans is the lowest level ever recorded the American dream is working for everybody and every American should be proud. You know it's not just been about more jobs it's been about better job. And since President Trump was elected the average American household has seen your disposable income go up by $5000.00 a year. Under the last administration the average American household lost $3000.00 a year in income and you all felt. And you're seeing how it's all how it's all improved and wages have been going up they're going up it's faster than they have in more than 10 years and they're rising most rapidly the president I couldn't be more proud wages today are rising most rapidly for hard working blue collar Americans the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. Thanks. And people know what. You all know when you see it in this great company I hear about it all over the country Karen and I slipped away for a long day and a half vacation about a few months ago. We went down to Sanibel Island Florida you ever heard of it it's right over there near Fort Myers Great Plains we were sitting out there on the beach true story had a ball caps on our sunglasses read a book trying to catch a little bit time on. And these 2 big boys came walking by both wearing Budweiser shirts man after my own heart. And they did one of them stopped and looked at me because a local newspaper it said that we were on the island. And one of the stop look to me said your pants aren't you. And I said yes or I am. And he said listen next time you see the president he said You tell him to keep doing what he's doing because I made twice as much money last years I made year before. And I said you know what I'm going to tell him that word for word and I did. And then he took 2 steps away turned back around and said and I don't know what you do the keep doing what you're doing to. And I told him I was. Very well known you know you feel the energy in this place you see a company grow you see a community thriving that's all. It's all happening for 2 reasons number one because you've got a president who understands. You've got on tired ministration great allies in Congress and understand what makes the most powerful free market economy in history the world work less taxes less regulation more low cost American energy better and fair trade deals and we've been fighting for me every day. But the truth of matter is President I also know the other half of the reason that America is prospering is because frankly the working men and women of America are the hardest working people in the world. Sure. Nobody can now work right nobody nobody cannot work the American worker and it's people like all of you gathered here that's why I'm really particularly excited to be here people I'm told like a lead ship builder here Marin I'm told he started here is a welder more than 40 years ago. He later became an electrician his son had followed in his footsteps and joined the company line like so many others that I've already met today and now this father and son are working side by side on the l.c.s. Minneapolis St Paul it's a great family effort contributing to this community contributing to the defense of this nation so would you join me in showing gratitude and appreciation for 44 years of service to Joseph Claiborne were you just. Words you saw right next to him around. Thank you. Great great family or I'm told there are the former Mariner Chief Police also in our midst he wore the badge for 30 years before joining this company as your security manager when he did he join nearly a dozen of his family members who were already here. Welders electricians and company spokeswoman it really was already a family affair but he brought his leadership skills his background his experience to come here and make sure that all you create here is properly secured and protected fact I'm told one of his daughters. Actually met her husband here. That's what we call a bonus. And they've now been married for 5 years and they've got a 3 year old son named Pearson join me in thanking Jeff score and the entire score family for their service to this community this company and this nation where are Really the Cleavers score. While skis and all the other families and Senate here are just emblematic of all of you the truth is what you've proved in this company. Is that when we level the playing field when we allow American businesses in American workers to compete we can compete and win against any workers anywhere in the world so give yourselves a round of applause Marron Amarin your proven it every day. I'm happy to report all of you about the promises kept by this president this administration and I want you all know that we recognize that it's thanks to all of you. And that leadership and support we've had from our allies in Congress at this country's prospering like never before and this president I promise you is committed to ensuring this prosperity reaches every American home but to do that we need to match the right jobs with the right workers in the skills in these companies also leading in that it's well it's remarkable to think that for more than a year and a half there have been more job openings in America then there are Americans looking for work I mean in fact there are 1000000 more job openings then there are unemployed Americans. It's extraordinary so workers in the skilled trades like so many of you here are in high demand it's true and that demand is only going to continue to grow as this economy is revived and is growing stronger by the day workers with your unique abilities and skills are going to be necessary to drive a growing American economy. And the truth is closing what the experts call the skills gap. Has to be job one and I promise you that you have a president and a vice president who believes that all honest work is honorable and we are working every single day to expand vocational education and vocational training for every American. We want to make sure. We want to make sure that every American has access to education they want to follow their dreams when I was governor of the state of Indiana I was reflecting on the fact that back back when I was coming out of high school in the 1970 s.. Things were different I'm sure they were in Wisconsin too right I mean there are some people here with hair the same colors mine right I mean when I when I went to high school there wasn't. We all came in in the school the same way some of us to turn left and go down the study a.p. English some a situation right and go down to industrial arts we ate the same cafeteria we cheered the same team we walked across the same stage and graduation day all right I mean but somewhere along the way it is true isn't it our high school got out of the business of offering education and training for every American on every pathway and I don't have to tell the people here at f m m what good paying jobs and great careers there her manufacture and that's why this president has taken decisive action to make vocational education and job training more accessible than ever before in our 1st year the president expanded apprenticeships and vocational training to help every American adapt to this changing and growing economy and last year we launched with the help of even this company something called the pledge to America's workers. To encourage businesses in every field to expand opportunities for training for American workers and American jobs by signing the pledge like this company do it companies committed to create training opportunities over the next 5 years for students for workers either through apprenticeship continuing education or on the job training now when the this is I'm really excited to tell you this when the pledge for America's workers was launched. Our 1st year goal was 500000 training opportunities in apprenticeships. But I got to be honest with you we didn't we didn't hit that number as I stand before you today more than 370 companies have pledged almost 15000000 training opportunities and apprenticeships for American workers. Let's call them they're promising and over deliver. And we're really just getting started I mean would you just give the great team here your c.e.o. again. Give them all I think it's here if a man has committed to 3000 apprenticeships and job training post right here in this company thank you so very much. And I want to thank you and g.m. and all of you for this incredible commitment to Wisconsin and Michigan for leading by example. The truth is you know there are people maybe looking on right now I mean there the literally tens of Americans that might be watching this on C-Span. Might be excited to hear you know what I go up to Wisconsin and there's companies up there that are ready to help me get the training so I can work on one of these and I can be a part of something really important not just for my family and for my community but for my nation those training opportunities we're going to have even more people that can fill this jobs in this growing economy here in Wisconsin will be more competitive on the world stage as well I mean the truth is under the president's leadership American workers are competing and winning with workers all over the world President Trump promised to work on making sure our economy had the conditions where companies and workers could grow and prosper but this president as I mentioned also promised to fight for trade deals that are free and fair and reciprocal President Donald Trump has delivered we negotiated a new trade deal with South Korea he signed 2 new trade agreements with Japan and we're working toward a free trade agreement with them and President Tput China on notice he said the era of economic surrender is over and China is at the negotiating table as we speak. So we've done a lot working on more when the u.k. finishes brix and we're going to work with them we're even talking to the European Union about a deal a closer to home there's a deal that's done that I want to ask for your help on before I slip away and catch a plane back to Indian. I don't know if you all know this but President when he campaigned through Wisconsin so that we can do better than NAFTA you know from the time NAFTA was signed in 1995 by President Bill Clinton we literally saw tens of thousands of factories close in this country and jobs open south of the border President Trump said we can do better we right out of the gate started in negotiations with our neighbors in Mexico and Canada and I'm going to tell you present a hard bargain. The man who wrote The Art of the deal one year ago closed the deal and the USMCA a is a win for Wisconsin workers and American jobs I promise you. And it's not just manufacturing I don't have tell your families concert about dairy I mean there's a lot you can go if your friends at work and dairy around here there's a lot going on up in Canada that was really working against the vitality of our dairy industry here in the upper Northwest present Trump stood Schroen with Prime Minister Trudeau held firm and we delivered we delivered for dairy we delivered a win for American agriculture now it's all good news u.s.m.c. has been down for a year but again one more example of something Congress apparently hasn't had time to get to. The midst of everything else they're doing the truth is Speaker Nancy Pelosi has had the u.s. m.c.a. on her desk for a year. She continues to say they're on a path to yes but the truth is Democrats in Congress have refused to bring it to the floor. Because I truly think if they bring it to the floor of the Congress it's going to hands it's going to be a win for Wisconsin and a win for American workers and I came here today to say The time has come for Democrats in Congress to put politics aside put America 1st and pass the u s m c a. Back. To make a difference in Wisconsin all across this country according to the i.t.c. this Mexico Canada agreement that we negotiated a year ago it's going to add about $70000000000.00 to our economy and create more than 175000 jobs including when it becomes law we predict that American manufacturing workers are going to get another raise his wages will continue to increase as exports expand in fact for Wisconsin the u.s.m.c. a becomes law in the United States will increase its exports of milk and cheese by 68000 tons. So we need to get this done with the last thing I just want to mention to you and I want to ask for you to get into because the truth is the clock is ticking. We all know there's a big presidential election coming next year and if you think Congress has a hard time getting anything done when it's not an election year just wait for an election year to come so the time has come for Congress to. To act and I want to encourage you here in Wisconsin to reach out to your members of Congress but let me let me save you a nickel you don't need to call Senator Ron Johnson because he's leading the charge for the u.s. m.c.a. in the United States Senate thank you Senator Johnson. And you also you also don't need to you don't need to call one of the rising stars in the Republican Congress 17 aeration Wisconsin I grew up in a small business family. Die hard Packers fan. Kind of goes without saying. But I'm so inspired as the father of a United States Marine he was a captain in the United States Marine Corps deployed twice to this country and he is fighting for jobs here in America and leading the charge join me in thanking Congressman Mike Gallagher will you he's a friend of. America. Thank you my. Thank you don't even call any of the Republicans members of Congress from Wisconsin because they're all in there standing with the president every single day on the u.s. and see it everything else but if you can then. You might just call Senator Tammy Baldwin. In my call Congressman Ron Conway. Tell Maren in a mike the other day a man Emory. And he told me that this u.s. m.c.s. been on the speaker of the house this for a year. Tell them Wisconsin and America need the u.s. and Ca and we need it this year you call. It a make a difference. You know I was a member of Congress for 12 years before I served as governor of the Hoosier State and. I can tell you there's. There's nothing more powerful in Washington d.c. than the voice of the American people. And u.s.m.c. is going to be a win for every American. So is your voice be heard. Thanks for coming out today thanks for the warm welcome I look forward to meeting as many of us time permits in the days and weeks that lie ahead all make you promise whatever Democrats want to spend their time on on Capitol Hill President Trump in our never stop fighting. We're never going to stop fighting to keep the promises that we made to people in Wisconsin we're never going to stop delivering on a strong national defense secure borders conservatives to our courts at every level and we're never going to stop fighting for jobs jobs jobs in Wisconsin and across America. The county. I mean. Sometimes people come up to me and say a very unnecessary thing they'll say tell the president to just to keep going. Let me tell you. That's something you never have to say to President Donald Trump. I mean as we say in the Hoosier state all the reverse is stripped out of that pickup truck it only goes forward and we're going to keep fighting to keep Wisconsin in America growing strong. So thank you again. I leave here today with this warm welcome so many great Americans I leave here today with renewed confidence. And faith faith in this president that I serve with every day that he's just going to keep on fighting every day. Keep the promises he made to the people in this state for stronger more prosperous and. When I come to a company like this my it also renews my faith in the people of this country.

I have instructed the commandant to extend amnesty for all qualified thank you Ok. Thank you Gen. It really is an honor to be here with so many inspiring young Americans and so many people that have made such a difference in the life of this is Stuart institution a couple of people that I have to mention particularly a fellow I've known for many many years he served in Congress from the great state of Indiana I know he is a distinguished a graduate of the citadel and he's one of the greatest champions of this institution anywhere in America would you join me in thanking former congressman Steve book here for a lifetime thank you thank you and I also had the pleasure today of meeting an American with an extraordinary lifetime of accomplishments past present and future she was in fact the 1st woman to ever graduate from the Citadel join me in thanking State Representative Nancy Mace Nancy thank you really is great to be here with so many distinguished people from all across the great state of South Carolina so many friends and allow me before I get started to bring greetings from another friend of mine. A great champion of all of the men and women who serve in the armed forces of the United States of America I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America President Donald Trump. Thank you. Thank you before I begin allow me to address an issue that I know is on the hearts of people all across South Carolina today and as your vice president and as a father let me say we were deeply saddened to receive word this afternoon that the remains of face what a 6 year old girl who went missing from her parents' front yard just 3 days ago and found a few moments ago I spoke on the phone with f.b.i. director Christopher Ray and I have assured governor McMaster that he will continue to have the full resources of the federal government made available in this investigation we will continue to work closely with state and local authorities to hold any to account who are responsible for this heinous crime but I would just urge everyone in South Carolina hug your kids today and keep this little girl and her family and her community in your prayers it is great to be back in South Carolina and as I said it's a special honor to be here at the Citadel for my very 1st visit where you all and those who came before you represent generations who have stood strong in defense of freedom for nearly 2 centuries it is remarkable to think that 200 years ago South Carolina militia men were drilling just outside the old citadels grounds proud citizen soldiers all. Dedicated themselves to the principles enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and secured in our Constitution but more remarkable still was the decision by the state legislature in $842.00 to take the guardhouse it built on those grounds only a few years before and it converted into an institution of higher learning. And ever since then the men and women of South Carolina's Corps of Cadets have added to the honor of this state and our nation Citadel graduates have served in every armed conflict since the Mexican War They fired on the federal steamship the tried to reinforce part Fort Sumter they sailed with the 1st American convoys to Europe in World War One And during World War 2 Your cadets enlisted in the armed forces at a higher rate than any other civilian college in America. one of your lawn NY cars Krauts was one of the do little Raiders. In your class of 1904 is known as the class that never was of the 565 cadets who started almost every last one of them under the military during the war the Citadel continued to serve our nation with 76 of your graduates giving the ultimate sacrifice in Vietnam but just as important as the lives you fought to defend or the ideals that you sought to preserve that of the citizen soldier always disciplined always honest always true to your core values honor duty respect they are the hall marks of every graduate of The Citadel. So I come here today. On behalf of the president of the United States and a grateful nation simply to commend each and every one of you men and women of your caliber could have gone to any school in the nation but you chose the harder path even when you were a lowly knob. You swore to uphold the Citadel honor code that the cadet does not lie cheat or steal nor tolerate those who do so whether you hail from Bravo beach. Or you drill with the some or all guards. Or even if you're one of those heart breaker to life taker types in our company at the. People of South Carolina and America couldn't be more proud of each and every one of you give all of yourselves around of applause thankfully. South Carolina Corps of Cadets truly is full of amazing Americans like a senior in Kilo Company army are o.t.c. a graduate from American Samoa I'm told when she was growing up she used to help her family take care of her great grandmother that experience inspired her to become a nurse when she was debating where to go to college didn't take her long to decide where to go her father served in the u.s. army for nearly 30 years and she was drawn to the Citadel's sense of discipline and accountability as I was told and she made the most of our opportunities here today she is a gold star danger list could it. And her parents and her community couldn't be more proud Would you join me in recognizing an incredible young woman who this may well become the citadels 1st Army nurse cadet Anna Mamy Tai. Or like I like another member of this corps like a pre-med biology major from actually Irmo South Carolina. Last year I'm told he was named one of the top 10 army are o.t.c. cadets in America it's not hard to see why Number 55 cap a 5 academic honor society pre-med society even the Citadel flying club just before he graduates in May He's going to accept a commission in the United States Army join me in thanking and recognizing cadet Paul Ryan where are you thank. The truth is on I'm all I and Paul are just emblematic of each and every one of you you all have your own stories you all answered your own calling to be here you answered the call of citizen soldiers sworn to uphold the highest ideals in a few months for many of you your future will begin many of you will go into the armed forces of the United States others of you will begin careers in the American workforce in the private sector. But I have every confidence as Commandant does and all of these great alumni do that all of you will bring with you the code of honor that you learned here at the Citadel and to those here that are graduating I'm proud to report to you thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump the America that awaits your energies and ambitions is experiencing a new era of optimism they say timing is everything for the class of 2020 you've got great timing because the American economy is booming thankfully on the 1st day of our administration President Trump promised to revive the American economy and we went straight to work with strong partners like Governor Henry McMaster in state houses across the country with great allies like Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott we've cut taxes across the board for working families businesses large and small We've rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in American history we unleashed American energy we fought for free and fair trade and a little more than 3 years businesses large and small that created 7000000 new jobs across this country including 121000 jobs right here in South Carolina Thankfully the unemployment rate is at nearly a 50 year low and more Americans are working today than ever before in the history of this country many of you will enter that economy and there's there are opportunities for men and women of integrity as never before in this economy so get ready get ready to bring everything you've learned here into this new opportunities. Some of you will go into private sector jobs some of you will go into public service some of you will follow the path of your extraordinary teachers and professors here and want to give them around of applause this is a problem. Some of you we hope will find your way in public life serve in public office as many of the people gathered with us today have done and to serve your country and stand up for the ideals that you learned here at the Citadel you know I can report in my 12 years in the Congress of the United States was actually my honor to serve alongside 3 graduates of the citadel during my tenure not only congressman Steve Bill you're the Congressman Gresham Barrett and Senator Fritz Hollings all proud graduates of the citadel and all great and distinguished public servants. So opportunities will abound for all of you that will graduate this year and all the use of graduates in the years ahead but of course the Citadel has a long and storied tradition of preparing the cadets not just for careers and lives in private life and in business in an enterprise in education and in public service but there's an extraordinary tradition here of military service upon graduation I'm actually told by the commandant that approximately one 3rd of you will receive a commission in the United States armed forces and I behalf of our commander in chief. You have the thanks of the American people for stepping forward to serve our nation. Here the citadel of you know the Armed Forces of the United States is the greatest force for good the world has ever known. many of you prepared to join that force let me say as your vice president and as the proud father of a United States Marine I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families from the earliest days of our administration President Trump has taken decisive action to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still we're giving our Armed Forces soldiers sailors airmen Marines and Coast Guard the resources and support they need to accomplish their mission and defend this nation in our 1st year in office President Trump actually signed the largest increase in our national defense in a generation including the largest pay raise for men and women in our armed forces in more than 10 years and as the president said in his historic state of the Union address just a little more than a week ago in his words we purchase finest planes rocket ships and every other military Quitman our soldiers sailors airmen Marines and Coast Guard will have the best of all be made right here in the USA.

I have instructed the commandant to extend amnesty for all qualified thank you Ok. Thank you Gen. It really is an honor to be here with so many inspiring young Americans and so many people that have made such a difference in the life of this is Stuart institution a couple of people that I have to mention particularly a fellow I've known for many many years he served in Congress from the great state of Indiana I know he is a distinguished a graduate of the citadel and he's one of the greatest champions of this institution anywhere in America would you join me in thanking former congressman Steve book here for a lifetime thank you thank you and I also had the pleasure today of meeting an American with an extraordinary lifetime of accomplishments past present and future she was in fact the 1st woman to ever graduate from the Citadel join me in thanking State Representative Nancy Mace Nancy thank you really is great to be here with so many distinguished people from all across the great state of South Carolina so many friends and allow me before I get started to bring greetings from another friend of mine. A great champion of all of the men and women who serve in the armed forces of the United States of America I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America President Donald Trump. Thank you. Thank you before I begin allow me to address an issue that I know is on the hearts of people all across South Carolina today and as your vice president and as a father let me say we were deeply saddened to receive word this afternoon that the remains of face what a 6 year old girl who went missing from her parents' front yard just 3 days ago and found a few moments ago I spoke on the phone with f.b.i. director Christopher Ray and I have assured governor McMaster that he will continue to have the full resources of the federal government made available in this investigation we will continue to work closely with state and local authorities to hold any to account who are responsible for this heinous crime but I would just urge everyone in South Carolina hug your kids today and keep this little girl and her family and her community in your prayers it is great to be back in South Carolina and as I said it's a special honor to be here at the Citadel for my very 1st visit where you all and those who came before you represent generations who have stood strong in defense of freedom for nearly 2 centuries it is remarkable to think that 200 years ago South Carolina militia men were drilling just outside the old citadels grounds proud citizen soldiers all. Dedicated themselves to the principles enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and secured in our Constitution but more remarkable still was the decision by the state legislature in $842.00 to take the guardhouse it built on those grounds only a few years before and it converted into an institution of higher learning. And ever since then the men and women of South Carolina's Corps of Cadets have added to the honor of this state and our nation Citadel graduates have served in every armed conflict since the Mexican War They fired on the federal steamship the tried to reinforce part Fort Sumter they sailed with the 1st American convoys to Europe in World War One And during World War 2 Your cadets enlisted in the armed forces at a higher rate than any other civilian college in America. one of your lawn NY cars Krauts was one of the do little Raiders. In your class of 1904 is known as the class that never was of the 565 cadets who started almost every last one of them under the military during the war the Citadel continued to serve our nation with 76 of your graduates giving the ultimate sacrifice in Vietnam but just as important as the lives you fought to defend or the ideals that you sought to preserve that of the citizen soldier always disciplined always honest always true to your core values honor duty respect they are the hall marks of every graduate of The Citadel. So I come here today. On behalf of the president of the United States and a grateful nation simply to commend each and every one of you men and women of your caliber could have gone to any school in the nation but you chose the harder path even when you were a lowly knob. You swore to uphold the Citadel honor code that the cadet does not lie cheat or steal nor tolerate those who do so whether you hail from Bravo beach. Or you drill with the some or all guards. Or even if you're one of those heart breaker to life taker types in our company at the. People of South Carolina and America couldn't be more proud of each and every one of you give all of yourselves around of applause thankfully. South Carolina Corps of Cadets truly is full of amazing Americans like a senior in Kilo Company army are o.t.c. a graduate from American Samoa I'm told when she was growing up she used to help her family take care of her great grandmother that experience inspired her to become a nurse when she was debating where to go to college didn't take her long to decide where to go her father served in the u.s. army for nearly 30 years and she was drawn to the Citadel's sense of discipline and accountability as I was told and she made the most of our opportunities here today she is a gold star danger list could it. And her parents and her community couldn't be more proud Would you join me in recognizing an incredible young woman who this may well become the citadels 1st Army nurse cadet Anna Mamy Tai. Or like I like another member of this corps like a pre-med biology major from actually Irmo South Carolina. Last year I'm told he was named one of the top 10 army are o.t.c. cadets in America it's not hard to see why Number 55 cap a 5 academic honor society pre-med society even the Citadel flying club just before he graduates in May He's going to accept a commission in the United States Army join me in thanking and recognizing cadet Paul Ryan where are you thank. The truth is on I'm all I and Paul are just emblematic of each and every one of you you all have your own stories you all answered your own calling to be here you answered the call of citizen soldiers sworn to uphold the highest ideals in a few months for many of you your future will begin many of you will go into the armed forces of the United States others of you will begin careers in the American workforce in the private sector. But I have every confidence as Commandant does and all of these great alumni do that all of you will bring with you the code of honor that you learned here at the Citadel and to those here that are graduating I'm proud to report to you thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump the America that awaits your energies and ambitions is experiencing a new era of optimism they say timing is everything for the class of 2020 you've got great timing because the American economy is booming thankfully on the 1st day of our administration President Trump promised to revive the American economy and we went straight to work with strong partners like Governor Henry McMaster in state houses across the country with great allies like Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott we've cut taxes across the board for working families businesses large and small We've rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in American history we unleashed American energy we fought for free and fair trade and a little more than 3 years businesses large and small that created 7000000 new jobs across this country including 121000 jobs right here in South Carolina Thankfully the unemployment rate is at nearly a 50 year low and more Americans are working today than ever before in the history of this country many of you will enter that economy and there's there are opportunities for men and women of integrity as never before in this economy so get ready get ready to bring everything you've learned here into this new opportunities. Some of you will go into private sector jobs some of you will go into public service some of you will follow the path of your extraordinary teachers and professors here and want to give them around of applause this is a problem. Some of you we hope will find your way in public life serve in public office as many of the people gathered with us today have done and to serve your country and stand up for the ideals that you learned here at the Citadel you know I can report in my 12 years in the Congress of the United States was actually my honor to serve alongside 3 graduates of the citadel during my tenure not only congressman Steve Bill you're the Congressman Gresham Barrett and Senator Fritz Hollings all proud graduates of the citadel and all great and distinguished public servants. So opportunities will abound for all of you that will graduate this year and all the use of graduates in the years ahead but of course the Citadel has a long and storied tradition of preparing the cadets not just for careers and lives in private life and in business in an enterprise in education and in public service but there's an extraordinary tradition here of military service upon graduation I'm actually told by the commandant that approximately one 3rd of you will receive a commission in the United States armed forces and I behalf of our commander in chief.

CSPANMP252202085	Mike Pence	2020-02-25	"Vice President Pence Remarks at ""Keep America Great"" Rally"	Speech	My great friend, great, my great friend sonny Purdue the chairman, laura cox and all of you have come here from near and far. It is great to be back in the great lakes state. Oh thank you all for coming out today. Thanks for making us feel so welcome. We have had a great michigan day but I gotta tell you I'm here for one reason and one reason only and that is in michigan in America need four more years of president donald trump in the White house you know like all of you, I'm here because I stand with president donald trump this President stands up for american jobs and american workers. I stand with president donald trump when this president stands up for faith and family and the american flag, I stand with president donald trump right and when this president stands up to the radical democrats, their endless investigations and their socialist agenda. We stand with President donald trump you know it's amazing amazing to see all out today but I see it everywhere I go. The truth is four years ago a movement was born a movement of everyday americans from every walk of life. Record republican turnout in Iowa a historic state of the union address. America is stronger than ever before And while the democrats were still counting votes in the Iowa caucus Did you know President Treceived more votes in New Hampshire than any incumbent president in 50 years and best of all, best of all now, just a few short weeks ago after three years of endless investigations and their partisan impeachment, the United States senate cleared our president on all charges, justice was served, our constitution defended and president donald trump was acquitted forever. Yeah you know I can see it here tonight again the support for this president has never been stronger not just here in michigan but all over the country we were in we were in las Vegas on friday I got, I got to speak before the president took to the podium and I got to tell you he's a hard man to proceed but I slipped, I slipped out of there and I got in the car was headed to the airport ahead of him and there were more people outside the arena than were inside the arena in Nevada amazing to I mean where are united? You see all the divisions in the democratic party. It's amazing to me to think as their party prepares to vote In Michigan on March 10. I couldn't be more proud to say Republicans are all ready. United and Michigan will pledge all its demo its delegates to renominate President Donald Trump in 2020 thank you michigan and it really is because this president, this president delivered on all the promises that he made to the people of michigan and then some. I mean the truth is there's only one way you can describe the last three years. It's been three years of promises made and promises kept. I mean think about it. President trump promised to rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy and I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces. This president has already signed the largest increases in our military budget since the days of Ronald Reagan and as the proud father of a United States Marine captain. Yeah. And as of a month ago I'm the father in law of a navy Lieutenant. Oh, I couldn't be more proud To see this president finally insisting on the Congress to give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guard the resources and the support they need to defend this nation and for three years in a row a pay raise. The largest in 10 years for our men and women in Univ. Okay, the armed forces of the United States are the greatest force for good the world has ever known. Okay. Yeah. And under this president, we've made the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. And with that renewed american stink. We're standing tall on the world stage again. How great is it to have a president who embraces his role as leader of the free world. Truthfully, I stand before you today and the President's on his way back from India. Yeah, another successful trip. Our allies are contributing more to our common defense than ever before and under this president, If the world knows nothing else, the world knows this, America stands with Israel. Oh so we've been standing with our allies. Okay. And we've been standing up to our enemies. I mean think about it when the last administration was sending pallets of cash to terrorists in Iran this president has taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms on their soil. Yeah, last year american forces captured the last inch of territory The ISIS caliphate controlled and we took down their leader without one American casualty. And last month on New Year's eve when militants stormed our embassy in Baghdad, this president sent in the marines and said no more Benghazi's right. And when american lives were threatened by the most dangerous terrorists in the world, President donald trump took action and Qasem Soleimani is gone. Yeah. You know, the people of michigan deserve to know that every one of the democrats running for president, every one of them on that stage for that debate again tonight actually criticized President trump's decision to take down Bernie Sanders even called the President's decision to take out Soleimani quote, assassinating a government official? Well, I got news for Bernie Sanders Soleimani was not some government official, he was a terrorist. And president trump was right to take him down. That's what leadership looks like. That's the leadership of President Donald trump. I mean, the truth is this President does care deeply about the men and women of our armed forces. It truly does. Oh and his support. His support for our men and women in uniform also extends to all of you who wore the uniform of the United States President Donald trump is the veterans president and under his leadership were finally given you veterans in the room access to the real time world class health care that you earned in the uniform of the United States. Veterans choice is now available for every veteran in America. So it's been about national security. It's been about supporting our veterans. But this president also knows that national security starts with border security a well trust me Under the President's leadership, we have made historic investments in border security work to end the crisis of illegal immigration at our border. Mexico is doing more than ever before to secure their southern border. And our how about this apprehensions today Are down by more than 80% from one year ago on our southern border. And I didn't forget We've already started to build that wall 100 miles and counting and trust me, we're going to build it all. And as we secure our border as we uphold the rule of law, Let me make you this other promise As the grandson of an Irish immigrant who came through Ellis Island in 1923. Once we secure our border, we're going to pass immigration reform that puts America first. We're gonna have a merit based immigration system and fix this immigration system once and for all, we're gonna do it. We're gonna do. And let me also save to support the rule of law. I hope you all know, because they sure do that. This president, this vice president and this administration will always stand without apology for the men and women of Law enforcement. Yeah, yeah. Okay. You know that I tend to travel with a lot of law enforcement. I was driving into town today and I'm sorry about that. I I said, How many cars we got out there? And they said, you know, you got about 30 cars from all these different jurisdictions. And I'm humbled by that, I really am. Would you all mind just showing all these law enforcement officers how much we appreciate what they and their families make for our families, for this state and this nation. Let's hear it finally, to support the rule of law. This president also kept his word to the people of michigan. As I stand before you today, we've already confirmed More than 190 conservatives to our federal courts and they are all men and women who will uphold all the God given liberties enshrined in our constitution, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear on. Okay. And on a day, on a day when democrats in the senate actually voted down legislation that would protect the lives of Children that survive abortions. I couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands for the right to life. Think about that. And today democrats in the United States Senate voted down the born alive infant protection. And many democrats including the democrat governor of Virginia, actually openly advocated and fantasize. And as I stand before you today, you know, just recognize this. Every one of the leading democrats running for president has actually said there's no room for pro life americans in today's Democratic Party. Mhm. So let me say this. Let me say this to every pro life american Republican, independent or democrat, you have a home in the Republican party under President donald trump. Yeah, President donald tis the most pro life president in american history. And every pro life american is welcome. Yeah, so it's about security. It's been about our liberty and it's been about our most cherished values. And one other thing under this president. It's been about jobs, jobs, jobs from the first day of this administration. President trump said we could revive the american economy. Remember the last administration, We had a president in August of 2016 who looked at a state like Michigan or my home state of Indiana and the loss of 0.5 million manufacturing jobs. What magic wand do you have? Well, we didn't need a magic wand. We just needed president donald trump in the White House. This president went straight to work with our, with our allies in Congress, including some great conservatives from here in michigan. We cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in history. We unleashed american energy and we fought for free and fair trade. Nafta is gone. The U. S. M. C. A. Is here. That's a big deal. And now as I stand before you today, I don't have to tell you here in michigan, the american economy is booming Since election day 2016. Almost eight million jobs have been created by businesses large and small, including 100 and 2000 jobs right here in the Great Lakes State. And wages arise, wages are finally going up again. And what means the most to the president and me is wages are rising most rapidly for hard working blue collar americans. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more and the american people know it. The american people know it. I can tell from all the nods in the room. You see it here in michigan, I see it everywhere I go. It's true Karen and I slipped away for a spring break for a day last year. We went, we went down to florida. We go to this place called santa Bell Island. Pretty popular here in the midwest. Yeah, yeah. The president goes to palm beach. I go to santa Bella anyway. People on the island knew that we were there but we were sitting out on the beach. We had our books and our ball caps and sunglasses. Absolutely true story. These two big boys wearing Budweiser shirts came walking by this one fellow stops plants his feet and turns at me and he says, hey, you're pence. And I said yes I am. And he said, well listen, you gotta tell the president to keep doing what he's doing because I made twice as much money last year as I made the year before and I told him I would, I did. Yeah, true, yeah, yeah. And then he walked away, had a warm smile on his face and turned back and he said, I don't know what you do, but keep doing what you're doing to. And I told him I would, I mean I'm telling you the american people know it. I mean thanks to your support. Thanks to the confidence michigan place in this president and this president's leadership in three short years, we've made America great again. Yeah, no idea. Yeah. You got it to keep America great. We need michigan to decide right here and right now that you're going to vote for four more years for president donald trump in the white house. That's how we keep America Great. And think about it when you're out talking to your neighbors and friends say, you know, I ran into mike the other day in Troy and he was talking to me about this, think about it, write this down. If you're taking notes, four more years means more jobs, four more years means more judges four more years means more support for our troops and it's gonna take at least four more years to drain that swamp. That's, we're draining. You know, the choice in this election couldn't be clear. But honestly, men and women in michigan, the stakes couldn't be higher today. You have a president who loves this country, stands by our military, our workers, our freedoms, he believes in you and he believes in everything that's always made America great. And he fights for you every day and then you got these democrats running for president. I mean, did you all see that? You'll see that debate in las Vegas last week. Yeah, I didn't watch all of it either. I mean that wasn't a democrat debate. That was a demolition derby. What a train wreck. Now look, midwest, we know what a demolition derby is, right and it makes a lot of sound over. Seriously. I mean, you know, I grew up in a small town, county fair comes to town, right? So everybody with the creamiest cars in town would drive them into the infield and crash them into each other until only one was driving. So now you've got all these democrats with the creamiest ideas in politics smashing into each other and eventually there'll still be one still running. But I think we all know how this is gonna end. Yeah, there's gonna be a monster truck with a T on the hood that's gonna drive into the infield and roll over the top of the house. That What's that? Mhm. Right. You know? Yes, I mean, you know, the media has been spending the last few days trying to figure out who won the debate. So let's help them out. President donald twon the democrat debate in a knockout no contest, lights out, it's gonna happen again tonight. You know, the truth is today's Democratic Party has been taken over by radical leftists. I actually actually started in politics as a teenager in the Democratic Party. Did I was the youth, I was the youth, I was the youth democrat party coordinator in Bartholomew County indiana, I was I was, but I heard the voice of my second favorite President Ronald Reagan and I knew I belonged to the Republican Party. But when I served in Congress for 12 years, you know, I knew many of the democrats, but I gotta tell you, I don't recognize the Democratic Party today, the Democratic Party today is dominated by people that want to raise taxes, have open borders, support late term abortion and socialist policies that would crush our economy. I mean, it's amazing to think the democrats front runner boasts of being a Democratic socialist and he is he actually recently praised the literacy program under the dictatorship of Castro in cuba Yeah. And another one of their candidates actually said that he could teach anybody to farm. He said you dig a hole, put seed in it, put dirt on top of it, add water and up comes corn. Bye. Well, I don't know what's a more ignorant statement believing that socialism works or that farming is easy. I mean, it's amazing truth is when you look at their radical agenda, you can see why democrats have spent the last three years trying to run down this president because they know they can't run against this president. They tried to impeach our president because they know they can't defeat President Donald Trump in November of 2020. So I want to encourage all of you and every day that remains between now and election day. This november, keep bringing this enthusiasm, keep bringing your support, keep telling your neighbors and friends all across this great state. Everything that we've accomplished seriously at work at worship. Go out and tell the story. Tell them what they're not hearing about on most of their major cable television stations. Mhm Truthfully, I mean, michigan always plays an outsized role in the choice of the new american president and the people of michigan heard in this president's voice, An agenda that could turn this country around. And you said you you said yes to him in 2016 because you were all talking to each other. You weren't listening to the pundits of the posters. And you said you said michigan michigan knows leadership when they see it. They know an american agenda when they see it and we need you to go out and talk about that one more time. And in these challenging times, these challenging times when it seems like there's more that divides us in this country than any time in my lifetime. I have to tell you folks, I have faith, have faith in this president who I served with every day, whose drive and vision have made America great again and they're going to make this country greater than ever before. I have faith in the american people Who chose right in 2016 and this year Will choose freedom once again in 2020. I faith. And finally mike my heart is sustained probably the same way most of yours is. But I have faith that if we will continue to to turn our eyes to him who has always graced this nation throughout our long and storied history that he will yet bless America beyond anything that we could ask or imagine this one nation under God individual with liberty. And Mhm. So have faith. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen it's great to be with you today. But I got a plane to catch. I'm gonna head back to Washington D. C. The president gets back sometime early tomorrow and I figure we'll be right back to work at the White House. But I want to thank you. Oh yeah whole idea. I want to thank you for coming out and while I'm at it can I just say to michigan thank you for the privilege of being your vice president. It is the greatest. Yeah. Yeah. And let me just encourage you with these words. Don't ever doubt it. Don't ever doubt it. I see him every day. I see him when the I see him when the lights the lights and the cameras are not on folks. You can tell people you heard it from me. President Donald trump is the real deal. He says what he means, He means what he says. He never backs down. He's never stopped fighting to keep the promises that he made to the people of michigan and now it's our turn to fight for him it's on. But I just know I just know seeing all of your bright and shining faces that with your continued support every day Between now and November three we're going to keep on winning. We're gonna make michigan and America stronger and more prosperous than ever before. And with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years and with God's help. we're gonna keep America. Great! Thank you so much michigan. God bless you and God bless America.	My great friend, great, my great friend sonny Purdue the chairman, laura cox and all of you have come here from near and far. It is great to be back in the great lakes state. Oh thank you all for coming out today. Thanks for making us feel so welcome. We have had a great michigan day but I gotta tell you I'm here for one reason and one reason only and that is in michigan in America need four more years of president donald trump in the White house you know like all of you, I'm here because I stand with president donald trump this President stands up for american jobs and american workers. I stand with president donald trump when this president stands up for faith and family and the american flag, I stand with president donald trump right and when this president stands up to the radical democrats, their endless investigations and their socialist agenda. We stand with President donald trump you know it's amazing amazing to see all out today but I see it everywhere I go. The truth is four years ago a movement was born a movement of everyday americans from every walk of life. Record republican turnout in Iowa a historic state of the union address. America is stronger than ever before And while the democrats were still counting votes in the Iowa caucus Did you know President Treceived more votes in New Hampshire than any incumbent president in 50 years and best of all, best of all now, just a few short weeks ago after three years of endless investigations and their partisan impeachment, the United States senate cleared our president on all charges, justice was served, our constitution defended and president donald trump was acquitted forever. Yeah you know I can see it here tonight again the support for this president has never been stronger not just here in michigan but all over the country we were in we were in las Vegas on friday I got, I got to speak before the president took to the podium and I got to tell you he's a hard man to proceed but I slipped, I slipped out of there and I got in the car was headed to the airport ahead of him and there were more people outside the arena than were inside the arena in Nevada amazing to I mean where are united? You see all the divisions in the democratic party. It's amazing to me to think as their party prepares to vote In Michigan on March 10. I couldn't be more proud to say Republicans are all ready. United and Michigan will pledge all its demo its delegates to renominate President Donald Trump in 2020 thank you michigan and it really is because this president, this president delivered on all the promises that he made to the people of michigan and then some. I mean the truth is there's only one way you can describe the last three years. It's been three years of promises made and promises kept. I mean think about it. President trump promised to rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy and I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces. This president has already signed the largest increases in our military budget since the days of Ronald Reagan and as the proud father of a United States Marine captain. Yeah. And as of a month ago I'm the father in law of a navy Lieutenant. Oh, I couldn't be more proud To see this president finally insisting on the Congress to give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guard the resources and the support they need to defend this nation and for three years in a row a pay raise. The largest in 10 years for our men and women in Univ. Okay, the armed forces of the United States are the greatest force for good the world has ever known. Okay. Yeah. And under this president, we've made the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. And with that renewed american stink. We're standing tall on the world stage again. How great is it to have a president who embraces his role as leader of the free world. Truthfully, I stand before you today and the President's on his way back from India. Yeah, another successful trip. Our allies are contributing more to our common defense than ever before and under this president, If the world knows nothing else, the world knows this, America stands with Israel. Oh so we've been standing with our allies. Okay. And we've been standing up to our enemies. I mean think about it when the last administration was sending pallets of cash to terrorists in Iran this president has taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms on their soil. Yeah, last year american forces captured the last inch of territory The ISIS caliphate controlled and we took down their leader without one American casualty. And last month on New Year's eve when militants stormed our embassy in Baghdad, this president sent in the marines and said no more Benghazi's right. And when american lives were threatened by the most dangerous terrorists in the world, President donald trump took action and Qasem Soleimani is gone. Yeah. You know, the people of michigan deserve to know that every one of the democrats running for president, every one of them on that stage for that debate again tonight actually criticized President trump's decision to take down Bernie Sanders even called the President's decision to take out Soleimani quote, assassinating a government official? Well, I got news for Bernie Sanders Soleimani was not some government official, he was a terrorist. And president trump was right to take him down. That's what leadership looks like. That's the leadership of President Donald trump. I mean, the truth is this President does care deeply about the men and women of our armed forces. It truly does. Oh and his support. His support for our men and women in uniform also extends to all of you who wore the uniform of the United States President Donald trump is the veterans president and under his leadership were finally given you veterans in the room access to the real time world class health care that you earned in the uniform of the United States. Veterans choice is now available for every veteran in America. So it's been about national security. It's been about supporting our veterans. But this president also knows that national security starts with border security a well trust me Under the President's leadership, we have made historic investments in border security work to end the crisis of illegal immigration at our border. Mexico is doing more than ever before to secure their southern border. And our how about this apprehensions today Are down by more than 80% from one year ago on our southern border. And I didn't forget We've already started to build that wall 100 miles and counting and trust me, we're going to build it all. And as we secure our border as we uphold the rule of law, Let me make you this other promise As the grandson of an Irish immigrant who came through Ellis Island in 1923. Once we secure our border, we're going to pass immigration reform that puts America first. We're gonna have a merit based immigration system and fix this immigration system once and for all, we're gonna do it. We're gonna do. And let me also save to support the rule of law. I hope you all know, because they sure do that. This president, this vice president and this administration will always stand without apology for the men and women of Law enforcement. Yeah, yeah. Okay. You know that I tend to travel with a lot of law enforcement. I was driving into town today and I'm sorry about that. I I said, How many cars we got out there? And they said, you know, you got about 30 cars from all these different jurisdictions. And I'm humbled by that, I really am. Would you all mind just showing all these law enforcement officers how much we appreciate what they and their families make for our families, for this state and this nation. Let's hear it finally, to support the rule of law. This president also kept his word to the people of michigan. As I stand before you today, we've already confirmed More than 190 conservatives to our federal courts and they are all men and women who will uphold all the God given liberties enshrined in our constitution, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear on. Okay. And on a day, on a day when democrats in the senate actually voted down legislation that would protect the lives of Children that survive abortions. I couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands for the right to life. Think about that. And today democrats in the United States Senate voted down the born alive infant protection. And many democrats including the democrat governor of Virginia, actually openly advocated and fantasize. And as I stand before you today, you know, just recognize this. Every one of the leading democrats running for president has actually said there's no room for pro life americans in today's Democratic Party. Mhm. So let me say this. Let me say this to every pro life american Republican, independent or democrat, you have a home in the Republican party under President donald trump. Yeah, President donald tis the most pro life president in american history. And every pro life american is welcome. Yeah, so it's about security. It's been about our liberty and it's been about our most cherished values. And one other thing under this president. It's been about jobs, jobs, jobs from the first day of this administration. President trump said we could revive the american economy. Remember the last administration, We had a president in August of 2016 who looked at a state like Michigan or my home state of Indiana and the loss of 0.5 million manufacturing jobs. What magic wand do you have? Well, we didn't need a magic wand. We just needed president donald trump in the White House. This president went straight to work with our, with our allies in Congress, including some great conservatives from here in michigan. We cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in history. We unleashed american energy and we fought for free and fair trade. Nafta is gone. The U. S. M. C. A. Is here. That's a big deal. And now as I stand before you today, I don't have to tell you here in michigan, the american economy is booming Since election day 2016. Almost eight million jobs have been created by businesses large and small, including 100 and 2000 jobs right here in the Great Lakes State. And wages arise, wages are finally going up again. And what means the most to the president and me is wages are rising most rapidly for hard working blue collar americans. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more and the american people know it. The american people know it. I can tell from all the nods in the room. You see it here in michigan, I see it everywhere I go. It's true Karen and I slipped away for a spring break for a day last year. We went, we went down to florida. We go to this place called santa Bell Island. Pretty popular here in the midwest. Yeah, yeah. The president goes to palm beach. I go to santa Bella anyway. People on the island knew that we were there but we were sitting out on the beach. We had our books and our ball caps and sunglasses. Absolutely true story. These two big boys wearing Budweiser shirts came walking by this one fellow stops plants his feet and turns at me and he says, hey, you're pence. And I said yes I am. And he said, well listen, you gotta tell the president to keep doing what he's doing because I made twice as much money last year as I made the year before and I told him I would, I did. Yeah, true, yeah, yeah. And then he walked away, had a warm smile on his face and turned back and he said, I don't know what you do, but keep doing what you're doing to. And I told him I would, I mean I'm telling you the american people know it. I mean thanks to your support. Thanks to the confidence michigan place in this president and this president's leadership in three short years, we've made America great again. Yeah, no idea. Yeah. You got it to keep America great. We need michigan to decide right here and right now that you're going to vote for four more years for president donald trump in the white house. That's how we keep America Great. And think about it when you're out talking to your neighbors and friends say, you know, I ran into mike the other day in Troy and he was talking to me about this, think about it, write this down. If you're taking notes, four more years means more jobs, four more years means more judges four more years means more support for our troops and it's gonna take at least four more years to drain that swamp. That's, we're draining. You know, the choice in this election couldn't be clear. But honestly, men and women in michigan, the stakes couldn't be higher today. You have a president who loves this country, stands by our military, our workers, our freedoms, he believes in you and he believes in everything that's always made America great. And he fights for you every day and then you got these democrats running for president. I mean, did you all see that? You'll see that debate in las Vegas last week.

Yeah, there's gonna be a monster truck with a T on the hood that's gonna drive into the infield and roll over the top of the house. That What's that? Mhm. Right. You know? Yes, I mean, you know, the media has been spending the last few days trying to figure out who won the debate. So let's help them out.

CSPANMP252202086	Mike Pence	2020-02-25	Vice President Pence Remarks to Michigan Farm Bureau	Speech	"Well, hello, Michigan! It is wonderful to be with all of you. Thank you for such a warm and generous welcome. But before you get too comfortable, I'll tell you what - and maybe it's because we've both served as governors - but I have to tell you: As we look around that Cabinet table, this President and I are proud of every member of this Cabinet, but no one more so than the Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue. Would you give him another round of applause? Stand up, Sonny. Take another bow, will you? This is an incredible champion for American agriculture, and I'm honored to be with him today. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. And thank you for your kind words. My great friend Congressman John Moolenaar is with us today. (Applause.) You can give him a round - there he is. John, thank you. (Applause.) Great friend of this administration. A great champion for agriculture. And I was just chatting with Carl Bednarski in the back. I want to thank him and all of you for this warm welcome. To state elected leaders who are here and to all of you who are Michigan's voice of agriculture: It is great to be back in the Great Lakes State with the men and women of Michigan Farm Bureau. Thank you so much for being here. It's good to be among so many friends and to have an opportunity to share about the progress that we've made. But before I get started, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine, someone who has been a champion for American farmers and ranchers every day of this administration. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. The President said not long ago, in his words, ""Our nation was founded by farmers. Our independence was won by farmers. Our continent was tamed by farmers. Our armies have been fed by farmers and made of farmers."" And throughout our history, farmers have always and will always lead the way. This President believes it and his Vice President believes it. (Applause.) You can count on it, Michigan Farm Bureau. We really do. So for everything you've done, not only for Michigan but for America, I'm - I'm grateful for the opportunity just to come by and say thank you. Thank you for standing strong. Thank you for standing strong oftentimes through very difficult and challenging times, bringing out those extraordinary values that are synonymous with the farm. This President and this entire administration have supported agriculture from the very beginning. And just as you've stood with us, I promise you, Michigan Farm Bureau, we will always stand with you. And that's true of the President, as he described himself once as the kid from Queens, and it's also true of the Vice President. Born in a small town in southern Indiana, I was raised right here in the heart of the Heartland. Small town, southern Indiana, I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard. I grew up among farmers. I really did. Some of my very best friends were some of the greatest family farms in Bartholomew County, Indiana. I detasseled some corn. About the time I got to high school, my dad and his business partners decided to buy 100 head of cattle. And I will let you guess what my three brothers and I were doing with shovels for most of the year. (Laughter.) We were shoveling out - shoveling out anywhere we needed to. We added a couple of horses, and there was even more mucking of the stalls to be done. But all of that was great preparation - great preparation for the lives that me and my three brothers would lead, because we had an opportunity. While we didn't live on a farm, we didn't consider ourselves farmers. We - we learned the values that you learn through a lot of hard work, through a lot of early mornings and late nights. You know, the truth is, you look all across the Heartland of this country, whether it be here in Michigan or in my home state of Indiana, and we do two things especially well out this way: We make things and we grow things. And here in Michigan, you've always led the way in both of those categories. It's remarkable to think for more than 100 years, the Michigan Farm Bureau has stood up for the rights of farmers. And today, thanks to your leadership, I'm told you represent more than 50,000 farms in this state alone, which produce more than 300 products. You contribute more than $101 billion to the state's economy. And as of today, Farm Bureau Michigan members actually employ nearly a million Michiganders. That's - one fifth of this state's workforce is agriculture. (Applause.) Incredible contribution. And beyond the economic impact, you - you contribute to this state in another great way. You know, the President and I firmly believe that - that while our country is many things, and has always been many things, that at our core, America is agriculture. What you sow, the nation reaps. What you plant bears fruit not only all over the country, but all over the world. You know and you personify the dignity of a hard day's work. The values that echo through your communities across this state or down across the nation - they always have, and they always will. You literally model every day the grit that drives our nation forward. And you, in every sense, embody the virtues and the values that are at the root of American greatness. Like a couple of people who are with us today, two seventh-generation farmers from Montgomery. They're actually brothers who are continuing a long family tradition of leadership in the agriculture community. One, I'm told, is the vice chairman of Michigan Farm Bureau State Young Farmer Committee. And the other is chairman of the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development. Today, their farm is thriving like never before. They've got about 4,000 acres in corn and 7,000 - and over 70,000 hogs they handle every single year. Would you join me in recognizing two extraordinary agricultural leaders in this state - past, present, and future - Brian and Paul Pridgeon? Where are you guys? Take a stand. (Applause.) Stand up and take a bow. Thank you, guys. Great job. And there's another couple of brothers, I'm told, from Grand Junction who are here with us today, who have actually made a real difference in the life of this nation. They've been standing up for farmers' rights for years. Anybody that knows them a little bit knows they're not shy about talking about private property rights and what it takes to make it in agriculture. Their farm is certified to use good stewardship practice to manage water, nutrients, and wildlife habitats. So as you can imagine, when the last administration had tried to take control over bodies of water as small as ditches and wet spots on their land, these two brothers took action. They spoke out at public meetings. They engaged the EPA. They let people all across Michigan know what that rule would mean to farmers like them. And I'm proud to say that, thanks to their energetic efforts, the Michigan Farm Bureau and Farm Bureau members all across America, their work paid off when President Donald Trump ditched the rule. (Applause.) The Waters of the U.S. rule, as you know it, is gone. (Applause.) They did it. They did it. That's just - that's just great citizenship. That's great advocacy. And these two are great leaders of Michigan's agriculture community, not to mention I'm told - I'm told they sell the best fresh blueberries in the state. (Laughter.) I don't know who said that, but I just bought a couple of blueberry pancakes from that diner and they may well have come from that farm. Join me in thanking Tom and Larry Bodtke. Where are you guys? (Applause.) Take a bow, will you, guys? Great job. Thanks. You know, Brian and Paul, and Tom and Larry, I called them out today, but, really, they're emblematic of all of you and the farmers that you represent all across this great state. And I'm here to tell you, from early in this administration, the President has been working every day to keep the promise that he made to support America's proud family farming tradition, and that's exactly what we've done. Earlier in our administration, you may remember back when we were campaigning through Michigan in 2016, the President actually promised to repeal two federal regulations for every new federal rule put on the books. But we actually haven't done that. I've got to be honest with you: We've actually repealed eight federal regulations for every new federal rule - (applause) - put in the Code of Federal Register. True. Thanks to the President's leadership, we are modernizing the NEPA regulations for the first time in 40 years. And we're already on track, under the President's One Federal Decision plan, to cut environmental review periods by more than half. And thanks to strong support of people like Congressman John Moolenaar and his colleagues in the Congress, we were able to roll back the taxes on working families, small businesses, and family farms. In our very first year in office, we cut taxes across the board. We lowered the corporate tax rate. We lowered the tax rate for pass-throughs, which so many family farms are. And, I'm proud to say, we eliminated the death tax for nearly every family farmer in America. (Applause.) That's big. We also changed the expensing rule so that now farmers can deduct 100 percent of the cost of every piece of new equipment you buy. And I know just enough about farming to know what input costs are. And as people look at - as people look at gross income in agriculture, a lot of times you have - you have reporters that will write up about how much farmers make, and they never talk about how much it costs to be in farming. And the changes in the expensing rules, we know, made a real difference - made a real difference for American farmers, and we're proud of it. And while we've been unleashing the full potential of the American economy through less taxes and less regulation, a greater respect for private property, this President has been fighting for free and fair trade from the first day we arrived in office. (Applause.) It's true. We've been working - we've been working to open up markets to American exports, most especially agriculture. And we've had considerable success. You know, for years, one administration after another - frankly, in both political parties - stood by while we amassed extraordinary trade deficits with China. I mean, China took advantage of access to our economy while giving very limited access of what we grow and what we make to their economy. It's amazing to think when we went through our inauguration on January 20th, 2017, literally half - $500 billion - half of our international trade deficit was with China. But this President made it clear: Those days are over. The era of economic surrender to China is over. We stood strong. We stood strong. And let me just say - and I was just talking to Carl backstage about that - Michigan Farm Bureau and farmers across this country stood strong with us as the President imposed strong tariffs on China to bring them forward. And I have to tell you that the way farmers really stood in the pocket was inspiring, wasn't it, Sonny? Because the reality is that it created some uncertainty. But I heard farmers, everywhere I went across the country, stop me on the street and say, ""You know, we know it's got to be done, so we're going to stand with you while you get it done."" Because you all understand what it is to do hard things, to get hard things done. And because of the strong stand that you took, because of the strong stand President Trump took just a few short weeks ago, we signed the phase one deal with China dealing with intellectual property rights and securing $40 to $50 billion in agricultural exports to China in the next two years. It's a start. (Applause.) It's a start back. Now, we got a ways to go. The President has made it very clear we - as a part of the phase one deal, we rolled back tariffs that the President had placed since September on imports from China. But the balance are all still there. And we're currently - our teams are currently talking and negotiating. And I promise you, we're going to continue to stand firm with China until we level the playing field for American agriculture, for American manufacturing, and for American workers. This President, on trade, is always going to put America first. And evidence of that, after years since NAFTA was signed into law, and I don't have to tell you all here in Michigan what the impact that NAFTA had on many communities, particularly manufacturing communities in this state. Down in Indiana, we literally saw entire communities have factories shuttered. There was one - one community in my old congressional district - Anderson, Indiana - that went from about 20,000 employees one day to three employees the next. And those jobs all moved south of the border to Mexico. And it had impacts on agriculture as well. Well, when we were campaigning through the state in 2016, our President said, ""We could do better."" He said we could - we could renegotiate our trading relationship with Mexico and China. And there was a lot of people that were skeptical. But this President rolled his sleeves up. And I got to tell you, I was there every step of the way. I met many times with those same leaders, and I got to tell you, the man who wrote ""The Art of the Deal"" got a great deal for the American people. The USMCA is here. And it's a huge win for American farmers. Make no mistake about it. We all know the USMCA corrected much of the imbalance in manufacturing now. We think we've removed many of the incentives, intentional or otherwise, that were in NAFTA to move jobs out of this country. We think we've leveled the playing field. But this is a win - this is a win for agriculture as well. Canada has actually agreed to expand market access for American dairy, for egg, for poultry. American wheat growers will have access to a more level playing field. And we're going to sell $2.2 billion more in agriculture exports to Canada and Mexico alone. That includes $300 million in dairy exports in just the first few years. The USMCA is a win for agriculture. When it's all said and done, we think it's actually going to add in the early going about 600,000 jobs in the city and on the farm, and maybe as much as $235 billion to our economy, just right out of the gate. It's just incredible what happens when you got a President who's willing to engage our neighbors, engage countries around the world in a way that I think would resonate with every - with every farmer in the country and every farmer gathered here today. You know, this is President who - I've watched him. I've watched him. He's - he first starts with the relationship. He starts with establishing a rapport. And then, before you know it, at no particular point in the conversation, he just drops the hammer. (Laughter.) Right? He does. You all know how that works, don't you? (Laughs.) Right? I mean, just - it's - we can be friends. But it doesn't mean that business isn't business. And this is the exact approach that President Trump has taken on trade. I mean, I'll never forget - I'll never forget - I won't say what country it was, Sonny, but I think you were in the room. And we were sitting at a table and we were all on this one side of the table. Our whole delegation and their whole delegation was on the other side of the table. And the President sits down and he says, ""Hey, Mr. Prime Minister. Great to see you."" He said, ""Melania loves your wife. I hope you're having a great time. How was your dinner last night?"" ""Great, great, great. Great to see you, and we love having you here."" And everybody is smiling and this and that. And he goes, ""Okay, but you're killing us on cars."" (Laughter.) ""And that's going to stop."" And I saw him do the same thing on dairy, I saw him do the same thing on agriculture. I am telling you what: You have a man who is going to keep fighting every single day for jobs and opportunities in the city and on the farm in all of our trade negotiations with countries around the world. And he's going to do it like a winner. And we're going to keep winning. That's what leadership looks like. That's what leadership looks like, and that's the leadership of President Donald Trump. So we've cut taxes. We've rolled back more red tape already than any administration in American history. We've unleashed American energy. We fought for free and fair trade. And I don't have to tell you here in the state of Michigan, this economy is booming. Since Election Day, businesses large and small across this country have created more than 7 million new jobs, new good-paying jobs, including - including 102,000 good-paying jobs right here in the state of Michigan. Unemployment is at a 50-year-low. The unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanic Americans has hit the lowest level ever recorded. And more Americans are working today than ever before in the history of this country. So we've made great progress, and I'm here to let you know that this administration - this administration just considers that a good start. I mean, you have a President with a boundless confidence in the American people and a boundless belief in the capacity of Americans to achieve and to create opportunities, if given the opportunity with the applications of commonsense free-market principles to do that. We're ready to go to work to make sure America's farmers and ranchers prosper like never before. We're going to stand strong with you no matter what political philosophy or political winds are blowing. President Donald Trump, this Vice President, and this administration will always stand with the American farmer. I promise you. And we'll always honor what you do - because I have to tell you, this small-town kid and this big-city President, we both get it. We understand the challenges and the complexities and the extraordinary ability and courage that it takes to succeed in farming today.  I mean, it's remarkable to think that we actually live in a time when some major national candidates are denigrating America's farmers. I mean, one candidate - I'm sure you all saw it - one of their other side's candidates for President said, ""I can teach anybody…to be a farmer."" (Laughter.) He said, ""It's a process. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, you add water, up comes corn."" I have never heard a more uninformed, ignorant statement about agriculture in my life. (Applause.) I mean, really and truly. And this isn't just coming from a guy, you know, that was governor of the state where Purdue University is located, right? Not from far Michigan state. Good heavens. (Laughter.) Somebody tell him to Google ""agriscience."" Take a ride on a combine and see how many screens you're looking at. Right? I mean, GPS satellites, water moisture in the ground - I mean, you all are - you're the bread basket of the world because you're - this is a high-tech operation. And the range of knowledge that you have to have in finance and technology and soil management, it just - it's extraordinary. I mean, I'm - I'm always in awe. I'm always in awe whenever I visit farmers and see the extraordinary range of information that you take. You're small-business owners and yet you're out there - you're out there with your sleeves rolled up, getting the work done early and getting the work done late. You know, for all of that kind of commentary, the other day I couldn't help but put out on social media a different attitude about agriculture. And it came from one of my favorite radio broadcasters, many years ago. It was about 40 years ago, Paul Harvey, I think was at a Farm Bureau gathering, when he spoke these words. And let me quote them generously, because I think it's the right view of the American farmer. 'On the eighth day, God looked down on his planned paradise and [He] said, I need a caretaker, somebody willing to get up before dawn, work all day in the fields, then go to town, stay past midnight at a meeting of the school board, Somebody who'd plow deep and straight and not cut corners. Somebody to seed, [and] weed, [and] feed, [and] breed and rake and disc and plow and plant Somebody who [would] bale a family together with the strong, soft bonds of sharing, who would laugh and then sigh, and then reply, with smiling eyes, when his son says that he wants to spend his life doing what dad does. So God made a farmer'. I believe this nation has been blessed in countless and innumerable ways. But God made a farmer, and God made an American farmer. (Applause.) And you have been a blessing to America every day of our nation's history. And it's not just been what you produce, it's not just been those extraordinary economic numbers, the complexity of farming, but it's also - I think the greatest contribution that farmers have made through the long and storied history of this nation has been to the character of our nation. It's remarkable to me how many times in that book that I try and stop and read every morning, that the Nazarene actually points to the farmer, to consider the farmer, the one who tills the soil when trying to teach us patience and teach us the hard virtues of faith and generosity and neighborliness. I really believe this with all my heart. It's maybe more important in these divided times than ever before that the - that the family farm prospers and thrives because it's, in so many ways, a wellspring of our nation's character. And I just want you to know that as you contribute to the vitality of this state and our nation, that your character and your faith contribute even more. So as I close, let me just say thank you. Thank you for the warm welcome today. Thank you for the privilege of serving as your Vice President. It's the greatest honor of my life. It truly is. And to all of you who work in agriculture, whose labor and life's work can be found in the food that we eat and the character of this nation: Thank you for who you are, and thank you for what you do. And to all of you who are even now considering a career in agriculture, these bright young people who might have noticed I was wearing my FFA tie today - (laughter and applause) - just know there's a great future in American farming, and we're counting on you to lead it. I truly do believe that agriculture is a quintessential American field. So thanks for believing in it. Thanks for living it out. Thanks for making the hard choices. And just know that, on behalf of the President of the United States and this Vice President, our Secretary of Agriculture and all the men and women of this administration, and a grateful nation: Keep doing what you're doing. Keep growing it, keep raising it, and keep being it, for as the American farm is strong, America is strong. And as the American farm is greater than ever before, we'll keep America great. Thanks, everybody. (Applause.) God bless you, and God bless America. "	Well, hello, Michigan! It is wonderful to be with all of you. Thank you for such a warm and generous welcome. But before you get too comfortable, I'll tell you what - and maybe it's because we've both served as governors - but I have to tell you: As we look around that Cabinet table, this President and I are proud of every member of this Cabinet, but no one more so than the Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue. Would you give him another round of applause? Stand up, Sonny. Take another bow, will you? This is an incredible champion for American agriculture, and I'm honored to be with him today. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. And thank you for your kind words. My great friend Congressman John Moolenaar is with us today. You can give him a round - there he is. John, thank you. Great friend of this administration. A great champion for agriculture. And I was just chatting with Carl Bednarski in the back. I want to thank him and all of you for this warm welcome. To state elected leaders who are here and to all of you who are Michigan's voice of agriculture: It is great to be back in the Great Lakes State with the men and women of Michigan Farm Bureau. Thank you so much for being here. It's good to be among so many friends and to have an opportunity to share about the progress that we've made. But before I get started, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine, someone who has been a champion for American farmers and ranchers every day of this administration. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. The President said not long ago, in his words, 'Our nation was founded by farmers. Our independence was won by farmers. Our continent was tamed by farmers. Our armies have been fed by farmers and made of farmers.' And throughout our history, farmers have always and will always lead the way. This President believes it and his Vice President believes it. You can count on it, Michigan Farm Bureau. We really do. So for everything you've done, not only for Michigan but for America, I'm - I'm grateful for the opportunity just to come by and say thank you. Thank you for standing strong. Thank you for standing strong oftentimes through very difficult and challenging times, bringing out those extraordinary values that are synonymous with the farm. This President and this entire administration have supported agriculture from the very beginning. And just as you've stood with us, I promise you, Michigan Farm Bureau, we will always stand with you. And that's true of the President, as he described himself once as the kid from Queens, and it's also true of the Vice President. Born in a small town in southern Indiana, I was raised right here in the heart of the Heartland. Small town, southern Indiana, I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard. I grew up among farmers. I really did. Some of my very best friends were some of the greatest family farms in Bartholomew County, Indiana. I detasseled some corn. About the time I got to high school, my dad and his business partners decided to buy 100 head of cattle. And I will let you guess what my three brothers and I were doing with shovels for most of the year. We were shoveling out - shoveling out anywhere we needed to. We added a couple of horses, and there was even more mucking of the stalls to be done. But all of that was great preparation - great preparation for the lives that me and my three brothers would lead, because we had an opportunity. While we didn't live on a farm, we didn't consider ourselves farmers. We - we learned the values that you learn through a lot of hard work, through a lot of early mornings and late nights. You know, the truth is, you look all across the Heartland of this country, whether it be here in Michigan or in my home state of Indiana, and we do two things especially well out this way: We make things and we grow things. And here in Michigan, you've always led the way in both of those categories. It's remarkable to think for more than 100 years, the Michigan Farm Bureau has stood up for the rights of farmers. And today, thanks to your leadership, I'm told you represent more than 50,000 farms in this state alone, which produce more than 300 products. You contribute more than $101 billion to the state's economy. And as of today, Farm Bureau Michigan members actually employ nearly a million Michiganders. That's - one fifth of this state's workforce is agriculture. Incredible contribution. And beyond the economic impact, you - you contribute to this state in another great way. You know, the President and I firmly believe that - that while our country is many things, and has always been many things, that at our core, America is agriculture. What you sow, the nation reaps. What you plant bears fruit not only all over the country, but all over the world. You know and you personify the dignity of a hard day's work. The values that echo through your communities across this state or down across the nation - they always have, and they always will. You literally model every day the grit that drives our nation forward. And you, in every sense, embody the virtues and the values that are at the root of American greatness. Like a couple of people who are with us today, two seventh-generation farmers from Montgomery. They're actually brothers who are continuing a long family tradition of leadership in the agriculture community. One, I'm told, is the vice chairman of Michigan Farm Bureau State Young Farmer Committee. And the other is chairman of the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development. Today, their farm is thriving like never before. They've got about 4,000 acres in corn and 7,000 - and over 70,000 hogs they handle every single year. Would you join me in recognizing two extraordinary agricultural leaders in this state - past, present, and future - Brian and Paul Pridgeon? Where are you guys? Take a stand. Stand up and take a bow. Thank you, guys. Great job. And there's another couple of brothers, I'm told, from Grand Junction who are here with us today, who have actually made a real difference in the life of this nation. They've been standing up for farmers' rights for years. Anybody that knows them a little bit knows they're not shy about talking about private property rights and what it takes to make it in agriculture. Their farm is certified to use good stewardship practice to manage water, nutrients, and wildlife habitats. So as you can imagine, when the last administration had tried to take control over bodies of water as small as ditches and wet spots on their land, these two brothers took action. They spoke out at public meetings. They engaged the EPA. They let people all across Michigan know what that rule would mean to farmers like them. And I'm proud to say that, thanks to their energetic efforts, the Michigan Farm Bureau and Farm Bureau members all across America, their work paid off when President Donald Trump ditched the rule. The Waters of the U.S. rule, as you know it, is gone. They did it. They did it. That's just - that's just great citizenship. That's great advocacy. And these two are great leaders of Michigan's agriculture community, not to mention I'm told - I'm told they sell the best fresh blueberries in the state. I don't know who said that, but I just bought a couple of blueberry pancakes from that diner and they may well have come from that farm. Join me in thanking Tom and Larry Bodtke. Where are you guys? Take a bow, will you, guys? Great job. Thanks. You know, Brian and Paul, and Tom and Larry, I called them out today, but, really, they're emblematic of all of you and the farmers that you represent all across this great state. And I'm here to tell you, from early in this administration, the President has been working every day to keep the promise that he made to support America's proud family farming tradition, and that's exactly what we've done. Earlier in our administration, you may remember back when we were campaigning through Michigan in 2016, the President actually promised to repeal two federal regulations for every new federal rule put on the books. But we actually haven't done that. I've got to be honest with you: We've actually repealed eight federal regulations for every new federal rule - - put in the Code of Federal Register. True.

'On the eighth day, God looked down on his planned paradise and said, I need a caretaker, somebody willing to get up before dawn, work all day in the fields, then go to town, stay past midnight at a meeting of the school board, Somebody who'd plow deep and straight and not cut corners. Somebody to seed, weed, feed, breed and rake and disc and plow and plant Somebody who bale a family together with the strong, soft bonds of sharing, who would laugh and then sigh, and then reply, with smiling eyes, when his son says that he wants to spend his life doing what dad does. So God made a farmer'. I believe this nation has been blessed in countless and innumerable ways. But God made a farmer, and God made an American farmer. And you have been a blessing to America every day of our nation's history. And it's not just been what you produce, it's not just been those extraordinary economic numbers, the complexity of farming, but it's also - I think the greatest contribution that farmers have made through the long and storied history of this nation has been to the character of our nation. It's remarkable to me how many times in that book that I try and stop and read every morning, that the Nazarene actually points to the farmer, to consider the farmer, the one who tills the soil when trying to teach us patience and teach us the hard virtues of faith and generosity and neighborliness. I really believe this with all my heart. It's maybe more important in these divided times than ever before that the - that the family farm prospers and thrives because it's, in so many ways, a wellspring of our nation's character. And I just want you to know that as you contribute to the vitality of this state and our nation, that your character and your faith contribute even more. So as I close, let me just say thank you. Thank you for the warm welcome today. Thank you for the privilege of serving as your Vice President. It's the greatest honor of my life. It truly is. And to all of you who work in agriculture, whose labor and life's work can be found in the food that we eat and the character of this nation: Thank you for who you are, and thank you for what you do. And to all of you who are even now considering a career in agriculture, these bright young people who might have noticed I was wearing my FFA tie today - - just know there's a great future in American farming, and we're counting on you to lead it. I truly do believe that agriculture is a quintessential American field. So thanks for believing in it. Thanks for living it out. Thanks for making the hard choices. And just know that, on behalf of the President of the United States and this Vice President, our Secretary of Agriculture and all the men and women of this administration, and a grateful nation: Keep doing what you're doing. Keep growing it, keep raising it, and keep being it, for as the American farm is strong, America is strong. And as the American farm is greater than ever before, we'll keep America great. Thanks, everybody. God bless you, and God bless America.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?469685-1/vice-president-pence-remarks-michigan-farm-bureau	Vice President Mike Pence delivered remarks at Michigan Farm Bureau&rsquo;s Lansing Legislative Seminar.	469685-1

CSPANMP1262020121	Mike Pence	2020-06-12	Vice President Pence Remarks on Reopening the Economy	Speech	well, thank you all for that very warm welcome. And hello pennsylvania. It is great to be back in the keystone state and I'm very humbled by the words of administrator verma. She is an incredible public servant. And as we, as we walk through this amazing factory saw that your craftsmanship in high relief, I can tell you that Seema verma leading the Center for Medicaid and Medicare service, knows the quality of the work that you do and is making those products available to people all across America. Would you join me in thanking Seema verma. And it's great to be here with all of you. Thank you for coming out today. Thank you for making some time. More importantly, thank you for being a great american company, a company that's supporting our military, supplying our health care professionals and accompany them through one of the most challenging times in my lifetime, you kept the work going. You operated as an essential service. Join me in thanking a great american manufacturing company, Oberg Industry and your great leader Cliff for us. Thank you so really is inspiring to be in this impressive plant. And I know that each and every day as our nation passed through these challenging days, you came to work and provided excellent, excellent resources and products at the point of the need. So I want to thank you. I want to thank you on our behalf. But let me also extend thanks and greetings from a friend of mine, a man who loves the commonwealth of pennsylvania. I told him this morning that I was headed to the keystone state and to be honest with you, I thought he sounded just a little bit jealous. So allow me to bring greetings and gratitude from the 45th president of the United States of America. President Donald Trump really is a privilege to be here on the president's behalf today. Not just to say thank you, but to be out among people across the Pittsburgh area. Today. It even stopped David's diner for maybe the best Reuben I've ever had in my life. And I'm here to tell you pennsylvania a great american combat has begun and you're leading as I stand before you today, every state in America has already begun to reopen for business. And nearly three quarters of America's small businesses have also begun to reopen, building on a strong foundation That this president laid over the last three years that saw the creation of more than seven million jobs. Following our efforts to cut taxes roll back regulation, fight for free and fair trade and unleash american energy. I'm proud to report to you that On this day, one week ago the president and I stood in the rose garden and we're proud to announce that in the month of May. Thanks to hard working americans. Like all of you, our nation saw the largest one month increase in jobs in american history. I gotta tell you, I was, I was preparing to be on television that morning and I was here when all the economists were predicting they were all talking about the fact that they thought we might lose Eight million more jobs in these challenging times and that the unemployment rate might go up to 20%. But the american people prove them wrong and businesses large and small created more than three million jobs by the middle of May alone. And we're going to continue to move forward. I was talking to some economic experts over the last week and they said that at the time that that jobs report came out that Cliff only about 50% of small businesses in those first few weeks of may have begun to re open. Now according to the US Chamber we estimate that more than 80% of small businesses are open to one degree or another. And so for all the encouragement of those numbers, great testament to the resilience and faith and hard work of the american people. We're very confident that it's just the beginning and this american comeback has just begun. It's true. do all the things that made this economy great over the last 3.5 years created millions of jobs. And let me also say from my heart we're gonna make law and order a centerpiece of the great american comeback. Let me say from my heart what happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis. It was a tragedy. It shocked the conscience of the nation. President trump's made it clear, justice will be served. There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. There's also no excuse for rioting and looting and the violence that ensued here in Pittsburgh and around the country. Every american cherishes our First amendment rights and we respect the concerns and freedoms of peaceful protesters. I'm going to promise each one of you that we're as we did today at a church in the Pittsburgh area, President did yesterday in Dallas. We're going to continue to listen, we're gonna have ears to hear, we're going to learn and we're going to lead, but we're not going to defund the police I think all of you know, most of the men and women who serve in law enforcement every single day, put on the uniform, stand on the thin blue line are really the best of us. I grew up, one of the heroes of my youth was my uncle who was a Chicago police officer for 25 years. So we're working today in the aftermath of that, the tragic death of George Floyd. We're sitting down with law enforcement leaders at every level around the country and we're working with community leaders as we did today. The president announced yesterday, we're in the process of, of drafting executive action that will encourage police departments nationwide to meet the highest standards in the use of forest to have more resources for training and de escalation. But I want to tell you all here in pennsylvania, we're not gonna stop there. The truth is that many african american families in our major cities for more than a half a century have labored under failed policies of liberal democratic leadership, depriving them of jobs and opportunities and education excellence. That's why yesterday president trump made it clear we're gonna work with law enforcement and community leaders to find ways that we can improve, give them more tools and more resources. But we're going to work, we're going to work to expand jobs and opportunities and education excellence for african american families and all the families of our major cities. The president said we're going to build on the progress we've made. I I couldn't be more proud to tell you that as we saw those seven million jobs created in the last 3.5 years. We have the lowest unemployment ever recorded for african americans and hispanic americans. This president actually passed legislation with my friend Senator Tim Scott that created more than 4000 opportunity zones that have already attracted more than $100 billion of job creating investments in our major cities. In fact, with, with some of that foundation at work. In that last jobs report. I just mentioned There were more than 300,000 jobs created in that May report for African Americans alone. We're going to increase african american communities access to capital, build on the opportunity zones and help them create more jobs. But it's not just about jobs, it's also about making sure that young people coming up have access to the kind of education, including vocational training, that they need to enter jobs in great work places like this and to be a part of a growing economy. And the truth is that the president and I are going to keep working every single day to give african american families in our cities and every family the right to choose where their Children go to school, whether that's a public or private or parochial or religious school. so it's about education innovation, it's about prosperity and jobs, but also one of the things we learned during Sema and my work on the coronavirus task force was the unique and more severe impact of that virus on african americans in our country. And it was really a reflection of the fact that we have health disparities for many african american families in our inner cities. So the president also said yesterday that our team is going to be working, we're gonna be working to bring free market principles and solutions to allow african american families to have access to the same world clhealth care that every american deserves. And so it's about, it's about reform. It's about public safety, but it's about prosperity and education and health care and we are not going to rest until we continue the work that we make this a more perfect union. And together we open America up again for the prosperity of all of our citizens. And I'm here to talk about the great american comeback and the truth is it wouldn't be possible today, wouldn't be possible today without the strong leadership of President donald trump and the cooperation and compassion of the american people or the ingenuity and hard work of all the companies like this one kept food on the table, kept important medical devices headed to our health care system. You kept America moving in the most challenging times. But it was the President's leadership early on. I can tell you as the leader of the White House coronavirus task force that bought us invaluable time. It was not even before the month of january was over. President Tsuspended all travel from China. He put the health of America 1st. It's true. He stood up the White House coronavirus task force, we worked with companies just like this one unprecedented level. You know, when the president asked me to do this work at the end of february, he said to me that he wanted a whole of government approach. But it was very clear to me early on what he really wanted was a whole of America approach. The president brought in major industries, pharmaceutical industries to begin the research on new medicines and vaccines. He brought in, he brought in industries that would be in the process of creating medical equipment and supplies. I mean with what we stood up at an unprecedented level, almost on a wartime footing in this country was extraordinary to watch. In fact, I'm proud to report to you that just in pennsylvania alone, The president's direction, we were able to deliver more than 660 million masks and gowns and face shields and other personal protective equipment for our outstanding healthcare workers. maybe most meaningful to us at all. As, as we, as we looked overseas where the coronavirus was impacting countries, particularly in europe, we saw hospitals being overwhelmed. We saw people being denied access to equipment like ventilators. But because of the energetic efforts that the president deployed and because of american industry, I'm proud to report to you that no american who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. We made sure our health care workers and the people that they were serving those families had what they needed in the moment through the most difficult days of this pandemic. And we've also been expanding testing across the board. Again, it was early in the process that the president recognized that the old way of doing testing for this kind of illness was simply not going to scale to the volume that we would need. He brought in these vast commercial laboratories, he challenged them to begin to work together. In fact, when I was tapped at the end of february to lead the White House coronavirus task force between the C. D. C. And state public health labs. We've only done about 8000 coronavirus tests. As of this morning. More than 22 million tests have been performed all across the United States of America. It's an extraordinary expansion of access to testing from the outset of this pandemic. The american people have responded have stepped up, made great personal sacrifices each of us did and our own families. I mean it's worked a great hardship on our people but it was an example of the american people's willingness to put The health of others. 1st family members of neighbors of co workers and even people that they had never met. So all of the American people did what needed to be done through those 45 days and chief among them were the people that use the products that you make here at this great company. And I want to tell you, you've, you've been on your feet once. But would you mind getting on your feet for all the doctors, nurses, health care workers and first responders who took care of our families as if they were their own, under the most challenging circumstances imaginable. Just truly astonishing to see the way healthcare workers across this country stepped up, they and millions of americans did what needed to be done. Whether it was work from home school your kids at home or give some space to seniors in your family or in your neighborhood would be most vulnerable to the worst outcomes. Some closed down businesses. I'm proud to say that, that we were able over this time to provide businesses large and small across this country with the resources that, that they needed to get through this difficult time paycheck protection program that the president just extended one week ago has made it possible for many small business to keep people on the payroll and avoid losing losing vital momentum in their companies and in their workers. The truth is because of what we all did together as a nation, we slowed the spread, we flatten the curve, we saved lives and every single day we're one day closer to putting this coronavirus in the past for all that we've accomplished, There are some, some great partners all along the way. Seema mentioned that we forged a partnership with governors all across this nation. We speak to them every single week, don't we? On an ongoing basis about our, our national response. But I must tell you that the relief efforts that the Congress of the United States forge in a bipartisan manner. We're in the highest keeping of public service. President said early on, we want people to have access to family leave. We wanted to make sure there was direct payments for families that were impacted by the coronavirus, support for businesses, large and small, critical industries health care workers and first responders and leaders in congress responded and three of them are with us here today. And I, I'd like you to give a vigorous round of applause to three great friends of mine, great friends of the president and great partners in the progress that we have made Congressman G. T. Thompson, congressman, mike kelly and congressman guy wrenching thaler. Thank you so much for what you did for pennsylvania. For America. because of what they've done, because of what you've done because of the leadership the president provided As I said at the outset. Now, all 50 states have begun to reopen in a safe and responsible manner even while continuing practices that keep our families and communities safe practicing good hygiene. We're going back to work, we're going back to worship, we're getting out the stores, the restaurants like the one I dined at today and we're enjoying the great outdoors after going without what we once took for granted. We're also american manufacturing back to work from the earliest stage of our administration. This president has fought for manufacturing workers and companies just like this one Like the 700 employees at Oberg Industries here in Pennsylvania. You know, this is this company is emblematic of a great community, but a great manufacturing tradition. You know, I come from the state of indiana and pennsylvania is an awful lot like indiana in a certain respect. I always used to say we do two things well out this way. We make things and we grow things. And this is a great example of great company that proves that every single day the truth is under the president's policies of the last 3.5 years, manufacturing doing better than ever before including this great company. I'm actually told in 2018 when cliff bought this company, you set a new record for sales And then in 2019 they broke the record again. Congratulations Oberg Industries, that's an impressive record of success and I think they're gonna break it again, meaning the work you do here is impressive. Walking around the plant floor. I was incredibly inspired by the skill and the craftsmanship and the enthusiasm of every one of the employees here that I met this company plays a critical role in supporting the health of our nation and the security of our country. You make the tooling for aluminum cans that have protected the food supply all throughout this pandemic. You make parts that are critical for knee replacements, hip replacements, neck and back surgeries. That center for Medicaid Medicare Services makes available to americans every single day. And I'm also told that Goldberg's pennsylvania workers make parts that are used in ammunition for our troops, For the Abrams A one tank, the Ohio class nuclear submarines And the F 15. Thanks for helping to provide for the common defense. I'm a little bit partial Cliff people that help out with aircraft. I'm proud to say that I am the proud father of a Marine Corps aviator and the proud father in law of a Navy pilot And so we appreciate your professionalism. Speaking of great people in uniform, I just had lunch at David's diner with another one, good friend of mine and a great friend of the people of pennsylvania and a great citizen of the Safe. He's a veteran of the 10th mountain division, He earned two bronze stars. He received a Purple heart for wounds suffered in combat in Afghanistan. He's a proud son of Pittsburgh and he has become one of the most prominent advocates for veterans in the United States of America today. So would you join me in recognizing and appreciating a lifetime of service of Sean parnell Sean, thank you for being here. Sean, thank you. for your leadership, past, present and future. You know, Oberg Industries has been supporting our troops, not just with your products, but also through your extraordinary apprenticeship program. I was hearing about it from one of your employees. Bright young man. More than 40% of Oberg Pennsylvania employees are graduates of that apprenticeship program and I hope you know that our administration has been working to expand access to apprenticeships and vocational education day one. It's such a great program that one of your toolmaking apprentices Actually stayed with the company, I'm told for more than 28 years and worked his way up to be the ceo, would you join me in giving a round of applause for Mark paul Ilo. Where are you, Mark? I'm told we're actually joined today by some 60 apprentices of this company including a marine corporal by the name of Caleb bomb and an army corporal named Ron cooper Jr give them a round of applause will you? Where are you guys take about man, Stand up. Thank you for your service and congratulations man. I mean we're also honored to be joined by a former apprentice here at Oberg industry. Ron's dad who's a former Air Force sergeant. Where's Ron cooper hey dan. What a great family. These are great americans, part of a great american company and we're grateful for your work here. Even more grateful for your service in the uniform of the United States of America. Now there's going to be a lot more apprentices. I'm told working here in pennsylvania because just yesterday I was informed That mark decided to join in with our national effort. The pledge to America's workers and they pledged to create another 225 new jobs and apprenticeships in the next five years. So thank you, mark, thank you Alberg industry. So we're rolling. We're moving forward and as this comeback continues, We have every confidence the best days for Oberg industries. The best days for pennsylvania in America are yet to come help create more jobs and prosperity. I'm proud to report to you. The President is also gone to work to help our economy out of this difficult time. The president signed executive action ordering every federal agency to find even more ways to provide regulatory relief, particularly for manufacturing all across this country. And we're going to continue to stand for energy independence for the american people. We're going to oppose efforts to ban fracking and the war on coal is over here in western pennsylvania and everywhere we're going to continue to fight every day to advance american energy independence, but it's great to be with you today. I I hope to have a chance to come down and at least greet some of you. Before I slip back to Washington, D. C. I had to come out today to talk about a great american comeback, but also just to thank all of you, all of you, Good people that have kept this vital essential company rolling during some of the most challenging times in life our nation and now other businesses large and small are joining you as we reopen America seems like we passed through a very challenging time of the last few months and weeks and I know at times it may seem like there's more that divides us in this nation than many times in my lifetime, but I must tell you and I saw this at a, at a church in Pittsburgh today, I'll always believe that there will always be more that unites us in this great country than could ever divide us and chief among those things his faith. So as I close, I would just say to each one of you that if you're of a mind to bow the head and bend the knee from time to time, I'd encourage you to do it, Pray for the more than 110,000 families that have lost loved ones and maybe some sitting among us today, you'll always be on our hearts and in our prayers. I pray for all of the people of this country have suffered hardship over the last several months and pray pray that as we listen to one another, we look for ways to improve the prosperity and well being and opportunities for every american regardless of race, creator color, that we would continue to bring our nation together on that foundation. I heard it from pastors today at the covenant Church, one after another who said during these challenging times, we need, we need to reach out to that Wellspring of american strength seen us through much more challenging times, even than those that we pass through this year, we can claim that promise that if his people who are called by his name, will humble themselves and pray. He'll do like he's always done the long and storied history of this nation, you'll hear from heaven and heal heal this land? This one Nation under God with liberty and justice for all. So let's pray for America as we open up America because the best is yet to come. Thank you all very much. God bless you.	well, thank you all for that very warm welcome. And hello pennsylvania.

It's true. do all the things that made this economy great over the last 3.5 years created millions of jobs. And let me also say from my heart we're gonna make law and order a centerpiece of the great american comeback. Let me say from my heart what happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis. It was a tragedy. It shocked the conscience of the nation. President trump's made it clear, justice will be served. There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. There's also no excuse for rioting and looting and the violence that ensued here in Pittsburgh and around the country. Every american cherishes our First amendment rights and we respect the concerns and freedoms of peaceful protesters. I'm going to promise each one of you that we're as we did today at a church in the Pittsburgh area, President did yesterday in Dallas. We're going to continue to listen, we're gonna have ears to hear, we're going to learn and we're going to lead, but we're not going to defund the police I think all of you know, most of the men and women who serve in law enforcement every single day, put on the uniform, stand on the thin blue line are really the best of us. I grew up, one of the heroes of my youth was my uncle who was a Chicago police officer for 25 years. So we're working today in the aftermath of that, the tragic death of George Floyd. We're sitting down with law enforcement leaders at every level around the country and we're working with community leaders as we did today. The president announced yesterday, we're in the process of, of drafting executive action that will encourage police departments nationwide to meet the highest standards in the use of forest to have more resources for training and de escalation. But I want to tell you all here in pennsylvania, we're not gonna stop there. The truth is that many african american families in our major cities for more than a half a century have labored under failed policies of liberal democratic leadership, depriving them of jobs and opportunities and education excellence. That's why yesterday president trump made it clear we're gonna work with law enforcement and community leaders to find ways that we can improve, give them more tools and more resources. But we're going to work, we're going to work to expand jobs and opportunities and education excellence for african american families and all the families of our major cities. The president said we're going to build on the progress we've made. I I couldn't be more proud to tell you that as we saw those seven million jobs created in the last 3.5 years. We have the lowest unemployment ever recorded for african americans and hispanic americans. This president actually passed legislation with my friend Senator Tim Scott that created more than 4000 opportunity zones that have already attracted more than $100 billion of job creating investments in our major cities. In fact, with, with some of that foundation at work. In that last jobs report. I just mentioned There were more than 300,000 jobs created in that May report for African Americans alone. We're going to increase african american communities access to capital, build on the opportunity zones and help them create more jobs. But it's not just about jobs, it's also about making sure that young people coming up have access to the kind of education, including vocational training, that they need to enter jobs in great work places like this and to be a part of a growing economy. And the truth is that the president and I are going to keep working every single day to give african american families in our cities and every family the right to choose where their Children go to school, whether that's a public or private or parochial or religious school. so it's about education innovation, it's about prosperity and jobs, but also one of the things we learned during Sema and my work on the coronavirus task force was the unique and more severe impact of that virus on african americans in our country. And it was really a reflection of the fact that we have health disparities for many african american families in our inner cities. So the president also said yesterday that our team is going to be working, we're gonna be working to bring free market principles and solutions to allow african american families to have access to the same world clhealth care that every american deserves. And so it's about, it's about reform. It's about public safety, but it's about prosperity and education and health care and we are not going to rest until we continue the work that we make this a more perfect union. And together we open America up again for the prosperity of all of our citizens. And I'm here to talk about the great american comeback and the truth is it wouldn't be possible today, wouldn't be possible today without the strong leadership of President donald trump and the cooperation and compassion of the american people or the ingenuity and hard work of all the companies like this one kept food on the table, kept important medical devices headed to our health care system. You kept America moving in the most challenging times. But it was the President's leadership early on. I can tell you as the leader of the White House coronavirus task force that bought us invaluable time. It was not even before the month of january was over. President Tsuspended all travel from China. He put the health of America 1st. It's true. He stood up the White House coronavirus task force, we worked with companies just like this one unprecedented level. You know, when the president asked me to do this work at the end of february, he said to me that he wanted a whole of government approach. But it was very clear to me early on what he really wanted was a whole of America approach. The president brought in major industries, pharmaceutical industries to begin the research on new medicines and vaccines. He brought in, he brought in industries that would be in the process of creating medical equipment and supplies. I mean with what we stood up at an unprecedented level, almost on a wartime footing in this country was extraordinary to watch. In fact, I'm proud to report to you that just in pennsylvania alone, The president's direction, we were able to deliver more than 660 million masks and gowns and face shields and other personal protective equipment for our outstanding healthcare workers. maybe most meaningful to us at all. As, as we, as we looked overseas where the coronavirus was impacting countries, particularly in europe, we saw hospitals being overwhelmed. We saw people being denied access to equipment like ventilators. But because of the energetic efforts that the president deployed and because of american industry, I'm proud to report to you that no american who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. We made sure our health care workers and the people that they were serving those families had what they needed in the moment through the most difficult days of this pandemic. And we've also been expanding testing across the board. Again, it was early in the process that the president recognized that the old way of doing testing for this kind of illness was simply not going to scale to the volume that we would need. He brought in these vast commercial laboratories, he challenged them to begin to work together. In fact, when I was tapped at the end of february to lead the White House coronavirus task force between the C. D. C. And state public health labs. We've only done about 8000 coronavirus tests. As of this morning. More than 22 million tests have been performed all across the United States of America. It's an extraordinary expansion of access to testing from the outset of this pandemic. The american people have responded have stepped up, made great personal sacrifices each of us did and our own families. I mean it's worked a great hardship on our people but it was an example of the american people's willingness to put The health of others. 1st family members of neighbors of co workers and even people that they had never met. So all of the American people did what needed to be done through those 45 days and chief among them were the people that use the products that you make here at this great company. And I want to tell you, you've, you've been on your feet once. But would you mind getting on your feet for all the doctors, nurses, health care workers and first responders who took care of our families as if they were their own, under the most challenging circumstances imaginable. Just truly astonishing to see the way healthcare workers across this country stepped up, they and millions of americans did what needed to be done. Whether it was work from home school your kids at home or give some space to seniors in your family or in your neighborhood would be most vulnerable to the worst outcomes. Some closed down businesses. I'm proud to say that, that we were able over this time to provide businesses large and small across this country with the resources that, that they needed to get through this difficult time paycheck protection program that the president just extended one week ago has made it possible for many small business to keep people on the payroll and avoid losing losing vital momentum in their companies and in their workers. The truth is because of what we all did together as a nation, we slowed the spread, we flatten the curve, we saved lives and every single day we're one day closer to putting this coronavirus in the past for all that we've accomplished, There are some, some great partners all along the way. Seema mentioned that we forged a partnership with governors all across this nation. We speak to them every single week, don't we? On an ongoing basis about our, our national response. But I must tell you that the relief efforts that the Congress of the United States forge in a bipartisan manner. We're in the highest keeping of public service. President said early on, we want people to have access to family leave. We wanted to make sure there was direct payments for families that were impacted by the coronavirus, support for businesses, large and small, critical industries health care workers and first responders and leaders in congress responded and three of them are with us here today. And I, I'd like you to give a vigorous round of applause to three great friends of mine, great friends of the president and great partners in the progress that we have made Congressman G. T. Thompson, congressman, mike kelly and congressman guy wrenching thaler. Thank you so much for what you did for pennsylvania. For America. because of what they've done, because of what you've done because of the leadership the president provided As I said at the outset. Now, all 50 states have begun to reopen in a safe and responsible manner even while continuing practices that keep our families and communities safe practicing good hygiene. We're going back to work, we're going back to worship, we're getting out the stores, the restaurants like the one I dined at today and we're enjoying the great outdoors after going without what we once took for granted. We're also american manufacturing back to work from the earliest stage of our administration. This president has fought for manufacturing workers and companies just like this one Like the 700 employees at Oberg Industries here in Pennsylvania. You know, this is this company is emblematic of a great community, but a great manufacturing tradition. You know, I come from the state of indiana and pennsylvania is an awful lot like indiana in a certain respect. I always used to say we do two things well out this way. We make things and we grow things. And this is a great example of great company that proves that every single day the truth is under the president's policies of the last 3.5 years, manufacturing doing better than ever before including this great company. I'm actually told in 2018 when cliff bought this company, you set a new record for sales And then in 2019 they broke the record again. Congratulations Oberg Industries, that's an impressive record of success and I think they're gonna break it again, meaning the work you do here is impressive. Walking around the plant floor. I was incredibly inspired by the skill and the craftsmanship and the enthusiasm of every one of the employees here that I met this company plays a critical role in supporting the health of our nation and the security of our country. You make the tooling for aluminum cans that have protected the food supply all throughout this pandemic. You make parts that are critical for knee replacements, hip replacements, neck and back surgeries. That center for Medicaid Medicare Services makes available to americans every single day. And I'm also told that Goldberg's pennsylvania workers make parts that are used in ammunition for our troops, For the Abrams A one tank, the Ohio class nuclear submarines And the F 15. Thanks for helping to provide for the common defense. I'm a little bit partial Cliff people that help out with aircraft. I'm proud to say that I am the proud father of a Marine Corps aviator and the proud father in law of a Navy pilot And so we appreciate your professionalism. Speaking of great people in uniform, I just had lunch at David's diner with another one, good friend of mine and a great friend of the people of pennsylvania and a great citizen of the Safe. He's a veteran of the 10th mountain division, He earned two bronze stars. He received a Purple heart for wounds suffered in combat in Afghanistan. He's a proud son of Pittsburgh and he has become one of the most prominent advocates for veterans in the United States of America today. So would you join me in recognizing and appreciating a lifetime of service of Sean parnell Sean, thank you for being here. Sean, thank you. for your leadership, past, present and future. You know, Oberg Industries has been supporting our troops, not just with your products, but also through your extraordinary apprenticeship program. I was hearing about it from one of your employees. Bright young man. More than 40% of Oberg Pennsylvania employees are graduates of that apprenticeship program and I hope you know that our administration has been working to expand access to apprenticeships and vocational education day one. It's such a great program that one of your toolmaking apprentices Actually stayed with the company, I'm told for more than 28 years and worked his way up to be the ceo, would you join me in giving a round of applause for Mark paul Ilo. Where are you, Mark? I'm told we're actually joined today by some 60 apprentices of this company including a marine corporal by the name of Caleb bomb and an army corporal named Ron cooper Jr give them a round of applause will you? Where are you guys take about man, Stand up. Thank you for your service and congratulations man. I mean we're also honored to be joined by a former apprentice here at Oberg industry. Ron's dad who's a former Air Force sergeant. Where's Ron cooper hey dan. What a great family. These are great americans, part of a great american company and we're grateful for your work here. Even more grateful for your service in the uniform of the United States of America. Now there's going to be a lot more apprentices. I'm told working here in pennsylvania because just yesterday I was informed That mark decided to join in with our national effort. The pledge to America's workers and they pledged to create another 225 new jobs and apprenticeships in the next five years. So thank you, mark, thank you Alberg industry. So we're rolling. We're moving forward and as this comeback continues, We have every confidence the best days for Oberg industries. The best days for pennsylvania in America are yet to come help create more jobs and prosperity. I'm proud to report to you. The President is also gone to work to help our economy out of this difficult time. The president signed executive action ordering every federal agency to find even more ways to provide regulatory relief, particularly for manufacturing all across this country. And we're going to continue to stand for energy independence for the american people. We're going to oppose efforts to ban fracking and the war on coal is over here in western pennsylvania and everywhere we're going to continue to fight every day to advance american energy independence, but it's great to be with you today. I I hope to have a chance to come down and at least greet some of you. Before I slip back to Washington, D. C. I had to come out today to talk about a great american comeback, but also just to thank all of you, all of you, Good people that have kept this vital essential company rolling during some of the most challenging times in life our nation and now other businesses large and small are joining you as we reopen America seems like we passed through a very challenging time of the last few months and weeks and I know at times it may seem like there's more that divides us in this nation than many times in my lifetime, but I must tell you and I saw this at a, at a church in Pittsburgh today, I'll always believe that there will always be more that unites us in this great country than could ever divide us and chief among those things his faith. So as I close, I would just say to each one of you that if you're of a mind to bow the head and bend the knee from time to time, I'd encourage you to do it, Pray for the more than 110,000 families that have lost loved ones and maybe some sitting among us today, you'll always be on our hearts and in our prayers. I pray for all of the people of this country have suffered hardship over the last several months and pray pray that as we listen to one another, we look for ways to improve the prosperity and well being and opportunities for every american regardless of race, creator color, that we would continue to bring our nation together on that foundation. I heard it from pastors today at the covenant Church, one after another who said during these challenging times, we need, we need to reach out to that Wellspring of american strength seen us through much more challenging times, even than those that we pass through this year, we can claim that promise that if his people who are called by his name, will humble themselves and pray. He'll do like he's always done the long and storied history of this nation, you'll hear from heaven and heal heal this land? This one Nation under God with liberty and justice for all. So let's pray for America as we open up America because the best is yet to come. Thank you all very much. God bless you.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?473032-1/vice-president-pence-remarks-reopening-economy	Vice President Pence made remarks on reopening the economy to employees at Oberg Industries in Sarver, Pennsylvania.	473032-1		
CSPANMP1662020127	Mike Pence	2020-06-16	Vice President Pence Visit to Mason City, Iowa	Speech	"Well, hello, Iowa! (Applause.) It is great to be in Iowa on this beautiful June day, to see all of you out in the sunshine. Would you join me in just thanking Governor Kim Reynolds and her husband, Kevin, for the incredible work that they do for the people of Iowa every day? (Applause.) That's a great leader. To Governor Reynolds, to Mayor Barney Ruiter, and to the first woman ever elected to the Iowa House of Representatives, Speaker Linda Upmeyer - (applause) - it is great to be back in the Hawkeye State as this state and America make a transition to greatness! (Applause.) And I really appreciate you all being here. I appreciate the warm welcome - the especially warm welcome. I really do. And I appreciate your inspiring example at this great company. More on that in a minute. I mean, to be here at an American company that, for 60 years, has kept America on the move is incredibly inspiring. I know you had to shut down, but you opened right back up. You put people back to work, and you got America back on the road. Let's hear it for Mike Happe and all the men and women of Winnebago, Iowa. And before I begin, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine - a man who loves the state of Iowa, who's actually the best friend of American manufacturing has ever had. And he even said the other day that he and Melania might just buy an RV real soon. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump! It really is a joy to be here on the President's behalf today, as we begin this transition to greatness. You know, as I stand before you today, I'm proud to report that, after the difficult times through which we have passed as a nation, that today, every state in this country and nearly three-quarters of America's small businesses have already begun to reopen. (Applause.) We're opening up America again, and you're part of that story. And we're building on the strong foundation of the first three years of this administration. After we cut taxes, rolled back regulations, fought for free and fair trade, unleashed American energy, supported American ethanol, we saw 7 million jobs created by businesses large and small. And on that foundation, once we started to open up America - you might have seen it a little more than a week ago - in the month of May, the people of America saw the largest one-month increase in job creation in American history - 2.5 million jobs added to our economy. I mean, I can't think of a greater example of America's resilience and strength than those numbers. I mean, the expert economists were all telling us that, in that report, that we would likely lose up to 8 million jobs. And they said that unemployment, Governor, was likely going to go from 14 percent, maybe up to 20 percent. But the American people proved them wrong. And businesses large and small created two and a half million jobs. And I don't know if you heard about it yet, but just this morning, after economists predicted that retail sales would increase by maybe 8 percent for the month of May, the American people shattered expectations again. Retail sales in America soared to 17.7 percent - the largest monthly increase ever recorded. (Applause.) America is going back to work! (Applause.) The recovery is on, and we're going to make our economy strong again - I promise you - on the same agenda that created millions of jobs over the past three years. And while I'm here in Iowa, I ought to take the opportunity to say thank you for two stalwart leaders who stood with President Trump and I every step of the way when we were rolling back regulations, when we were standing up for American farmers, when we were cutting taxes, supporting our military. I mean, this state is so well served by the principled conservative leadership of Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Joni Ernst. Would you mind showing your appreciation for these two outstanding leaders? They supported our agenda every step of the way of less taxes, less regulation, and strong support every day for the American farmer. I mean, you all saw the effects of the agenda that we've advanced right here at Winnebago. I'm told, after the President signed that tax cut a couple of years ago, Winnebago actually donated a million dollars to charity and gave thousands of you employees a well-deserved bonus. It was great corporate leadership. And on that foundation of growth - that generosity, that compassion, that ingenuity - we're driving a great American comeback. And as I stand before you today, I promise you: A centerpiece of our transition to greatness is going to be law and order. What happened to George Floyd was a tragedy and a disgrace. It should have never happened. It shocked the conscience of our nation. There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd, but there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting and violence that has ensued. Like every American, we cherish our First Amendment. We respect the concerns of peaceful protesters. And we're going to listen, we're going to learn, and we're going to lead. But we're not going to defund the police. I mean, you all here at Winnebago know, and people in Iowa know: Most of the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best of us. They're the best this country has to offer. But over the past several weeks, President Trump and I have been taking time, in this challenging national moment, to listen. We sat down with leaders in law enforcement. We've sat down with leaders in the African American community. As the President said today from the Rose Garden, we are one nation. We grieve together and we heal together. And today, after listening and learning, President Trump signed an executive order that will make immediate resources and training available to police departments across America to improve standards for the use of force, de-escalation, and accountability. (Applause.) We're going to help our police improve. And I know Governor Kim Reynolds brought about a unanimously passed piece of legislation she signed on the steps of your state capitol just last Friday, creating more oversight and more accountability. And I want to thank you, Governor, for your compassionate leadership, your support for law enforcement, and for bringing Iowa together. We're going to support law enforcement, and we're going to support our African American communities with resources and reform. But we're not going to stop there. As President Trump said in Dallas, we're going to move an agenda that promotes public safety, but we're also going to keep moving an agenda that promotes jobs, prosperity, and greater educational opportunities for all our minority communities in cities across this country - (applause) - just like we did over the last three years, which saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans; that saw this President create more than 8,000 Opportunity Zones in communities across the country, attracting billions of dollars of investment. We're going to work to bring jobs and investment to underserved communities. We're going to address the healthcare disparities that we learned especially about during the coronavirus pandemic. We're going to bring market solutions to give our minority communities more choices in their healthcare. And we're going to keep fighting every single day to give our African American families and every family the right to choose where their children go to school - a public, private, or parochial school. It'll be the parents' choice. And I'm very confident, even in these challenging times, that we'll do what Americans have always done: We'll form a more perfect union. And together, we'll move our nation forward. Together, we'll put Americans back to work. And together, we were - we will open up America again. It's happening before our eyes. You know, the comeback that we celebrate today would not have been possible without your hard work and determination. But let me also say, it would not have been possible without the leadership of President Donald Trump in partnership with governors and with the American people. You know, before we had a single coronavirus case in this country, this President shut down all travel from China. It bought us invaluable time to stand up our national response. You know, it's remarkable to think, at the end of February, when he asked me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we'd actually performed less than 8,000 coronavirus tests in the entire country. But today, we're testing roughly 60 times that number every single day. We've performed more than 23 million tests - more than anywhere in the world. That's American ingenuity at work. And let me take this opportunity to also commend your governor. Governor Kim Reynolds has already tested nearly a quarter of a million people through the Test Iowa program. In her tireless efforts, she's put the health of Iowans first. And Iowa has been setting the pace - setting the pace in the progress that we've made in this pandemic and opening up this great state again. Governor, thank you again for your leadership and your example. In addition to testing, we've been giving states what they need when they need it. That included more than 158 million masks and gowns and face shields and personal protective equipment here in Iowa alone. And thanks to that same ingenuity and hard work of American manufacturing, I'm proud to tell you: No American with coronavirus who ever needed a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. That's a national accomplishment. And from the outset of this pandemic, the American people made great personal sacrifices to protect the health of their family, their neighbors, and people that they never knew. And our doctors and nurses and healthcare workers and first responders rendered care to our families as if they were their own. Why don't we give them a round of applause? We've got heroes. We've got heroes in our hospitals and heroes in our first responders. But it was millions of Americans - you all made the sacrifices as well - stayed home from work, home from school, away from places of worship so cherished. Some closed down businesses that took a lifetime to build. And here at Winnebago, you did more than your part. Volunteers from this company, I'm told, made 36,000 masks that were manufactured for hospitals in Iowa. And you've also created face shields at this plant and distributed them to healthcare workers and first responders all across the state. Give yourselves a round of applause. That is - that's America. And I want to recognize, particularly, a craftsman here I'm told has worked at Winnebago, Iowa, for 25 years. He's created wooden cabinetry that vehicles are known for, even building prototype designs. But he's the one who worked with a team of manufacturers. He used, I'm told, a 3D printing machine to make face shields, donated them to local hospitals. So would you all join me in thanking somebody who volunteered his energy, his creativity, and made a difference in the lives of the people of this state? Where are you, Rod White? Let's hear it for Rod White. (Applause.) Stand up, Rod. Great job. Great job, Rod. Thank you, Rod. Thanks for bringing your talents to this moment, and thank you all for responding. You know, because of the hard work - because of the hard work of people like Rod and because of all of you, we met this moment. We met this moment, not just with the whole-of-Amer- whole-of-government response, but we met it with a whole-of-America response. The American people stepped forward, just like you all did. And it's a demonstration of the resilience and the faith and the resolve of our people. You know, thanks to the leadership of President Trump and Governor Kim Reynolds and all the good people of the Hawkeye State, I'm proud to report to you, here and across America, we slowed the spread. We flattened the curve. We saved lives. And that's why we're opening up America again. You did it. And as I said at the start, now all 50 states have begun to reopen in a safe and responsible way. You know, even before we got through those 45 Days to Slow the Spread, the President had us issue guidelines to give counsel to governors like yours about how a phased reopening could work, to strengthen the economy while protecting the health of our families and while continuing the practices that keep our families and communities safe. People are going back to work. They're going back to worship. We're getting back to our - to our lives. And the American people should be proud. We're going back to stores, going back to restaurants. And with the help from the men and women of Winnebago, we're also enjoying the great outdoors, I'm told, like almost never before. We're putting American manufacturing back to work. I know since May 4th, you all have been working hard, you've been maintaining your social distancing, doing your daily health checks. You've been taking care of your neighbors and your coworkers, you've been putting the healthier neighbors first. And it's a remarkable example that you've set here - remarkable example: 5,500 strong men and women of Winnebago are emblematic of manufacturing workers all across America who are the backbone of this economy. Like a senior machine setup operator who, I'm told, started working here right out of high school so he could save up for trade school. But he realized he liked working here so much he changed his plans and just decided to stay. I'm told his brother, Mark, works here too; so does his wife Carla. And on September 8th, he'll celebrate 50 years with this incredible company. Would you join me in showing our thanks and admiration to Glen Blazer and his whole family? (Applause.) Where are you, Glen? Stand up. Take a bow, Glen. Fifty years. (Applause.) Congratulations, Glen. Awesome. I did the math. You know, Glen must have started here after this place has been going about 10 years, and you've been here ever since. You made an incredible difference. And you helped set the pace for a company that's making a great difference, not only in this community, not only in this state, but all across the nation. You know, I was just told by some of the leadership here at the company that Americans are buying RVs at a pretty rapid pace. In fact, usually, I think we heard that roughly about a third of buyers every year are first-time buyers; it's pushing more like 50 percent. America is hitting the road in American-made RVs - (applause) - and you all should be proud that you made it happen. I mean, think about it: This President has said gas prices are low, summer is almost here. What better time to go see America in a great RV? You know, so it's great to be back in the Hawkeye State to be able to talk about this great American comeback, but also to just say thank you - and not just on behalf of the President of the United States, but just on behalf of a grateful nation. It's men and women like you, and companies like this, that are keeping America rolling, are getting America rolling again. I mean, it was - it was companies in essential industries that literally never stopped, and companies like this one - like Rod did - who transformed themselves to be a part of the solution for our healthcare workers and for our families. In one of the most challenging times in the life of our nation, it was the people who make things and the people who grow things who stepped up. And so I'm proud to be able to be here to pay a debt of gratitude to each and every one of you, just to say thank you for what you've done. You know, it seems like, these days, you turn on the television that it seems like there's more that divides us these days than has ever been true in my lifetime. But, you know, I actually think otherwise. I think there will always be more that unites us in these United States of America than could ever divide us, and chief among those virtues is a love of freedom and the faith of the American people. I mean, the way that the people of Iowa and people across this country have stepped up, kept doing the right things - practicing hygiene and social distancing but getting back to work, getting back to their lives, getting back out and supporting all those great, local businesses - affirms my belief that this is a freedom-loving nation. We love our freedom, and we know how to use it with commonsense and care for others. But I also know, as the President often says, that this is a nation of faith. I hear it everywhere I go. I was at Sally's Restaurant - try the hamburger. (Laughter.) She opened up today for the first time since the pandemic struck. (Applause.) You know, as I walked around Sally's Restaurant, I had more than a few people say those words that I hear just about everywhere I go in America, and that is: When people look at you and they lower their voice a little bit and they just say, ""I'm praying for you."" And you always know when people mean it, when it comes from their heart. And so let me just say, as I close, that if you're - if you're inclined to bow the head and bend the knee from time to time, I encourage you to do that during these challenging times. (Applause.) And I'm always humbled when people pray for us with those of us that have public responsibilities. But on this one, I - I'd like you to pray for the more than 116,000 families that have lost loved ones. The Bible says, ""The Lord is close to the brokenhearted,"" and I'd just remember them sometime this week in your prayers. Pray for all of those who have labor to provide care month after month, who've looked after our loved ones in hospitals, oftentimes taking the place of family that couldn't be with them because of the strictures of the contagion of the coronavirus. So pray for our healthcare workers and all those that have been alongside. And in these times of national challenge, I just also encourage you to pray for America. Pray for all the people of America and claim those ancient words that if His people, who are called by his name, will humble themselves and pray, you can believe that He'll do like He's always done in much more challenging times: He'll hear from heaven, and He'll heal this land, this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. So thank you, Winnebago. Thank you, Iowa. God bless you for all that you have done at this great company. God bless this state, and God bless America in this great American comeback. "	Well, hello, Iowa! It is great to be in Iowa on this beautiful June day, to see all of you out in the sunshine. Would you join me in just thanking Governor Kim Reynolds and her husband, Kevin, for the incredible work that they do for the people of Iowa every day? That's a great leader. To Governor Reynolds, to Mayor Barney Ruiter, and to the first woman ever elected to the Iowa House of Representatives, Speaker Linda Upmeyer - - it is great to be back in the Hawkeye State as this state and America make a transition to greatness! And I really appreciate you all being here. I appreciate the warm welcome - the especially warm welcome. I really do. And I appreciate your inspiring example at this great company. More on that in a minute. I mean, to be here at an American company that, for 60 years, has kept America on the move is incredibly inspiring. I know you had to shut down, but you opened right back up. You put people back to work, and you got America back on the road. Let's hear it for Mike Happe and all the men and women of Winnebago, Iowa. And before I begin, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine - a man who loves the state of Iowa, who's actually the best friend of American manufacturing has ever had. And he even said the other day that he and Melania might just buy an RV real soon. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump! It really is a joy to be here on the President's behalf today, as we begin this transition to greatness. You know, as I stand before you today, I'm proud to report that, after the difficult times through which we have passed as a nation, that today, every state in this country and nearly three-quarters of America's small businesses have already begun to reopen. We're opening up America again, and you're part of that story. And we're building on the strong foundation of the first three years of this administration. After we cut taxes, rolled back regulations, fought for free and fair trade, unleashed American energy, supported American ethanol, we saw 7 million jobs created by businesses large and small. And on that foundation, once we started to open up America - you might have seen it a little more than a week ago - in the month of May, the people of America saw the largest one-month increase in job creation in American history - 2.5 million jobs added to our economy. I mean, I can't think of a greater example of America's resilience and strength than those numbers. I mean, the expert economists were all telling us that, in that report, that we would likely lose up to 8 million jobs. And they said that unemployment, Governor, was likely going to go from 14 percent, maybe up to 20 percent. But the American people proved them wrong. And businesses large and small created two and a half million jobs. And I don't know if you heard about it yet, but just this morning, after economists predicted that retail sales would increase by maybe 8 percent for the month of May, the American people shattered expectations again. Retail sales in America soared to 17.7 percent - the largest monthly increase ever recorded. America is going back to work! The recovery is on, and we're going to make our economy strong again - I promise you - on the same agenda that created millions of jobs over the past three years. And while I'm here in Iowa, I ought to take the opportunity to say thank you for two stalwart leaders who stood with President Trump and I every step of the way when we were rolling back regulations, when we were standing up for American farmers, when we were cutting taxes, supporting our military. I mean, this state is so well served by the principled conservative leadership of Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Joni Ernst. Would you mind showing your appreciation for these two outstanding leaders? They supported our agenda every step of the way of less taxes, less regulation, and strong support every day for the American farmer. I mean, you all saw the effects of the agenda that we've advanced right here at Winnebago. I'm told, after the President signed that tax cut a couple of years ago, Winnebago actually donated a million dollars to charity and gave thousands of you employees a well-deserved bonus. It was great corporate leadership. And on that foundation of growth - that generosity, that compassion, that ingenuity - we're driving a great American comeback. And as I stand before you today, I promise you: A centerpiece of our transition to greatness is going to be law and order. What happened to George Floyd was a tragedy and a disgrace. It should have never happened. It shocked the conscience of our nation. There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd, but there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting and violence that has ensued. Like every American, we cherish our First Amendment. We respect the concerns of peaceful protesters. And we're going to listen, we're going to learn, and we're going to lead. But we're not going to defund the police. I mean, you all here at Winnebago know, and people in Iowa know: Most of the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best of us. They're the best this country has to offer. But over the past several weeks, President Trump and I have been taking time, in this challenging national moment, to listen. We sat down with leaders in law enforcement. We've sat down with leaders in the African American community. As the President said today from the Rose Garden, we are one nation. We grieve together and we heal together. And today, after listening and learning, President Trump signed an executive order that will make immediate resources and training available to police departments across America to improve standards for the use of force, de-escalation, and accountability. We're going to help our police improve. And I know Governor Kim Reynolds brought about a unanimously passed piece of legislation she signed on the steps of your state capitol just last Friday, creating more oversight and more accountability. And I want to thank you, Governor, for your compassionate leadership, your support for law enforcement, and for bringing Iowa together. We're going to support law enforcement, and we're going to support our African American communities with resources and reform. But we're not going to stop there. As President Trump said in Dallas, we're going to move an agenda that promotes public safety, but we're also going to keep moving an agenda that promotes jobs, prosperity, and greater educational opportunities for all our minority communities in cities across this country - - just like we did over the last three years, which saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans; that saw this President create more than 8,000 Opportunity Zones in communities across the country, attracting billions of dollars of investment. We're going to work to bring jobs and investment to underserved communities. We're going to address the healthcare disparities that we learned especially about during the coronavirus pandemic. We're going to bring market solutions to give our minority communities more choices in their healthcare. And we're going to keep fighting every single day to give our African American families and every family the right to choose where their children go to school - a public, private, or parochial school. It'll be the parents' choice. And I'm very confident, even in these challenging times, that we'll do what Americans have always done: We'll form a more perfect union. And together, we'll move our nation forward. Together, we'll put Americans back to work. And together, we were - we will open up America again. It's happening before our eyes. You know, the comeback that we celebrate today would not have been possible without your hard work and determination. But let me also say, it would not have been possible without the leadership of President Donald Trump in partnership with governors and with the American people. You know, before we had a single coronavirus case in this country, this President shut down all travel from China. It bought us invaluable time to stand up our national response. You know, it's remarkable to think, at the end of February, when he asked me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we'd actually performed less than 8,000 coronavirus tests in the entire country. But today, we're testing roughly 60 times that number every single day. We've performed more than 23 million tests - more than anywhere in the world. That's American ingenuity at work. And let me take this opportunity to also commend your governor. Governor Kim Reynolds has already tested nearly a quarter of a million people through the Test Iowa program. In her tireless efforts, she's put the health of Iowans first. And Iowa has been setting the pace - setting the pace in the progress that we've made in this pandemic and opening up this great state again. Governor, thank you again for your leadership and your example. In addition to testing, we've been giving states what they need when they need it. That included more than 158 million masks and gowns and face shields and personal protective equipment here in Iowa alone. And thanks to that same ingenuity and hard work of American manufacturing, I'm proud to tell you: No American with coronavirus who ever needed a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. That's a national accomplishment. And from the outset of this pandemic, the American people made great personal sacrifices to protect the health of their family, their neighbors, and people that they never knew. And our doctors and nurses and healthcare workers and first responders rendered care to our families as if they were their own. Why don't we give them a round of applause? We've got heroes. We've got heroes in our hospitals and heroes in our first responders. But it was millions of Americans - you all made the sacrifices as well - stayed home from work, home from school, away from places of worship so cherished. Some closed down businesses that took a lifetime to build. And here at Winnebago, you did more than your part. Volunteers from this company, I'm told, made 36,000 masks that were manufactured for hospitals in Iowa. And you've also created face shields at this plant and distributed them to healthcare workers and first responders all across the state. Give yourselves a round of applause. That is - that's America. And I want to recognize, particularly, a craftsman here I'm told has worked at Winnebago, Iowa, for 25 years. He's created wooden cabinetry that vehicles are known for, even building prototype designs. But he's the one who worked with a team of manufacturers. He used, I'm told, a 3D printing machine to make face shields, donated them to local hospitals. So would you all join me in thanking somebody who volunteered his energy, his creativity, and made a difference in the lives of the people of this state? Where are you, Rod White? Let's hear it for Rod White. Stand up, Rod. Great job. Great job, Rod. Thank you, Rod. Thanks for bringing your talents to this moment, and thank you all for responding. You know, because of the hard work - because of the hard work of people like Rod and because of all of you, we met this moment. We met this moment, not just with the whole-of-Amer- whole-of-government response, but we met it with a whole-of-America response. The American people stepped forward, just like you all did. And it's a demonstration of the resilience and the faith and the resolve of our people. You know, thanks to the leadership of President Trump and Governor Kim Reynolds and all the good people of the Hawkeye State, I'm proud to report to you, here and across America, we slowed the spread. We flattened the curve. We saved lives. And that's why we're opening up America again. You did it. And as I said at the start, now all 50 states have begun to reopen in a safe and responsible way. You know, even before we got through those 45 Days to Slow the Spread, the President had us issue guidelines to give counsel to governors like yours about how a phased reopening could work, to strengthen the economy while protecting the health of our families and while continuing the practices that keep our families and communities safe. People are going back to work. They're going back to worship. We're getting back to our - to our lives. And the American people should be proud. We're going back to stores, going back to restaurants. And with the help from the men and women of Winnebago, we're also enjoying the great outdoors, I'm told, like almost never before. We're putting American manufacturing back to work. I know since May 4th, you all have been working hard, you've been maintaining your social distancing, doing your daily health checks. You've been taking care of your neighbors and your coworkers, you've been putting the healthier neighbors first. And it's a remarkable example that you've set here - remarkable example: 5,500 strong men and women of Winnebago are emblematic of manufacturing workers all across America who are the backbone of this economy. Like a senior machine setup operator who, I'm told, started working here right out of high school so he could save up for trade school. But he realized he liked working here so much he changed his plans and just decided to stay. I'm told his brother, Mark, works here too; so does his wife Carla. And on September 8th, he'll celebrate 50 years with this incredible company. Would you join me in showing our thanks and admiration to Glen Blazer and his whole family? Where are you, Glen? Stand up. Take a bow, Glen. Fifty years. Congratulations, Glen. Awesome. I did the math. You know, Glen must have started here after this place has been going about 10 years, and you've been here ever since. You made an incredible difference. And you helped set the pace for a company that's making a great difference, not only in this community, not only in this state, but all across the nation. You know, I was just told by some of the leadership here at the company that Americans are buying RVs at a pretty rapid pace. In fact, usually, I think we heard that roughly about a third of buyers every year are first-time buyers; it's pushing more like 50 percent. America is hitting the road in American-made RVs - - and you all should be proud that you made it happen. I mean, think about it: This President has said gas prices are low, summer is almost here. What better time to go see America in a great RV? You know, so it's great to be back in the Hawkeye State to be able to talk about this great American comeback, but also to just say thank you - and not just on behalf of the President of the United States, but just on behalf of a grateful nation. It's men and women like you, and companies like this, that are keeping America rolling, are getting America rolling again. I mean, it was - it was companies in essential industries that literally never stopped, and companies like this one - like Rod did - who transformed themselves to be a part of the solution for our healthcare workers and for our families. In one of the most challenging times in the life of our nation, it was the people who make things and the people who grow things who stepped up. And so I'm proud to be able to be here to pay a debt of gratitude to each and every one of you, just to say thank you for what you've done. You know, it seems like, these days, you turn on the television that it seems like there's more that divides us these days than has ever been true in my lifetime. But, you know, I actually think otherwise. I think there will always be more that unites us in these United States of America than could ever divide us, and chief among those virtues is a love of freedom and the faith of the American people. I mean, the way that the people of Iowa and people across this country have stepped up, kept doing the right things - practicing hygiene and social distancing but getting back to work, getting back to their lives, getting back out and supporting all those great, local businesses - affirms my belief that this is a freedom-loving nation. We love our freedom, and we know how to use it with commonsense and care for others. But I also know, as the President often says, that this is a nation of faith. I hear it everywhere I go. I was at Sally's Restaurant - try the hamburger. She opened up today for the first time since the pandemic struck. You know, as I walked around Sally's Restaurant, I had more than a few people say those words that I hear just about everywhere I go in America, and that is: When people look at you and they lower their voice a little bit and they just say, 'I'm praying for you.' And you always know when people mean it, when it comes from their heart. And so let me just say, as I close, that if you're - if you're inclined to bow the head and bend the knee from time to time, I encourage you to do that during these challenging times. And I'm always humbled when people pray for us with those of us that have public responsibilities. But on this one, I - I'd like you to pray for the more than 116,000 families that have lost loved ones. The Bible says, 'The Lord is close to the brokenhearted,' and I'd just remember them sometime this week in your prayers. Pray for all of those who have labor to provide care month after month, who've looked after our loved ones in hospitals, oftentimes taking the place of family that couldn't be with them because of the strictures of the contagion of the coronavirus. So pray for our healthcare workers and all those that have been alongside. And in these times of national challenge, I just also encourage you to pray for America. Pray for all the people of America and claim those ancient words that if His people, who are called by his name, will humble themselves and pray, you can believe that He'll do like He's always done in much more challenging times: He'll hear from heaven, and He'll heal this land, this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. So thank you, Winnebago. Thank you, Iowa. God bless you for all that you have done at this great company. God bless this state, and God bless America in this great American comeback.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?473111-1/vice-president-pence-visit-mason-city-iowa	Vice President Mike Pence toured Winnebago Industries and spoke to employees to highlight the reopening of the country&rsquo;s economy.	473111-1		
CSPANMP1862020129	Mike Pence	2020-06-18	Vice President Pence Remarks in Michigan on Reopening the Economy	Speech	"Well, hello, Michigan! (Applause.) And thank you to, really, one of the hardest working members of the President's Cabinet. He is a dedicated American who is focusing on improving the lives of workers, even in these challenging times. Would you join me in thanking the Secretary of Labor, Gene Scalia? (Applause.) He's doing phenomenal job for America. Thank you for those good words, Mr. Secretary. To Secretary Scalia, to Congressman John Moolenaar, Congressman Paul Mitchell, our great friends; to State Representatives Annette Glenn and Shane Hernandez; and all of the incredible men and women of Chardam Gear and Casadei Steel: It is great to be back in the Wolverine State. Thank you for coming out in the sunshine on this balmy June day. Thank you for being part of a great American comeback right here in Michigan. I just had a - I just had a great tour of these two great companies. Casadei Steel and Chardam Gear are two tremendous American businesses. I want to congratulate all of you for the job you do with these two great companies. Eighty-four years been building America with the steel that is American strength and providing the technology that's been providing for our national defense. And I have to say - I have to say, with these two great companies that contribute so much to a safe and secure America, as your Vice President and as the proud father of a United States Marine aviator who flies an aircraft, parts of which are made right here: Thank you for all of you do to keep America safe. It really is good to be with all of you, and I've had a great day in Michigan. I just - I just had lunch at the Engine House over in Mount Clemens. (Applause.) Opened up on Monday. I couldn't decide between a cheeseburger and pasta, so I had both. And I know, as of Monday, just like all of Michigan, restaurants are opening up in this great state because we're opening up America again. And before I go any further, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine - a man who loves the state of Michigan and loves manufacturing and steel like no other American I have ever met. Allow me to bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. You know, we've all passed through very challenging times over the last several months. But I'm proud to report to you, after all that we've been through, standing here today because of the sacrifices the American people have made, because of the incredible dedication of our healthcare workers, because of the way that American businesses stepped up, every state in this country is now opened up again, and three-quarters of America's small businesses are going back to work. The transition to greatness has begun. And we're building and rebuilding this economy on a strong foundation of what we were able to over the first three years of this administration. You know, when President Trump and I were spending time in Michigan back in 2016, he promised the people of Michigan that we'd cut taxes for working families and businesses large and small; that we'd roll back federal red tape; that we'd unleash American energy; that we'd fight for free and fair trade that puts American jobs and American workers first. And President Donald Trump delivered on every promise he made to the people of Michigan - (applause) - and we saw more than 7 million jobs created in the first three years. And I have to tell you, all of that progress would not have been possible without two friends that I mentioned right at the top. I wanted to give you one more opportunity to thank them. They are two principled conservative leaders. They've been partners with this administration every step of the way. They are deeply respected in the Congress of the United States. So would you join me one more time in thanking Congressman Paul Mitchell and Congressman Moolenaar. (Applause.) Stand up and take a bow, guys. Thank you so much. (Applause.) They've been delivering for Michigan for the last three and a half years, and the President and I are so grateful. And you know what? Because of that foundation that we laid, after all that we've been through as a nation over these last several months, the American comeback has begun. In fact, just a few short weeks ago, we actually saw, in the month of May alone, the largest one-month increase in jobs in American history. (Applause.) It's true. And the experts were all telling us - weren't they, Mr. Secretary? - that we could lose 8 million new jobs. In that report, they said that unemployment across the country might go from 14 percent to 20 percent, but actually, the American people proved them wrong. In the last month alone, America's businesses created nearly 3 million jobs. And we didn't stop there. Last week, the experts also predicted that retail sales would only grow by about 8 percent. But the American people - the American people knew they had ""another thing coming,""as we say down in the Hoosier State. They shattered expectations. Retail sales soared by 17.7 percent, the largest monthly increase in sales ever recorded. The American people are driving the great American comeback. And as I stand before you today, I want to make all of you a promise that the centerpiece of this transition to greatness - a centerpiece of this comeback - is going to be law and order in every community, in every state in the nation. What happened to George Floyd in Minnesota was a tragedy. It shocked the conscience of every American. There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. But there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting and violence that ensued in cities across this country. Now, like every American, we cherish and will always defend the First Amendment right. Every one of our countrymen. We respect the concerns of peaceful protesters. The people of Michigan know that most of the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best people in this country. (Applause.) And we'll stand with them. I mean, we're listening; we're learning. And the action the President took this week reflects that we're leading. But I'll make you all a promise: We're not going to defund the police. You know, my uncle was a police officer in Chicago, not real far from here, for his entire career. He's one of the heroes of my youth. But I'll tell you, every one of us knows that the men and women in law enforcement really are the best of us. They put on that uniform every day and they go and risk their lives to protect and serve your families. That's why the President and I sat down with leaders of law enforcement. We sat down with leaders in the African American community. And President Trump took action this week. He signed an executive order to make immediate resources and training available to police departments. We're going to work with law enforcement, work with our African Americans leaders and neighbors, and we're going to improve standards for the use of force for every community in the country. We're going to help our police to improve. We're also going to support law enforcement with resources and reform. But I promise you: We're not going to stop there. As President Trump said in Dallas last week, we're also going to work with the Congress to continue to move forward an agenda that not just includes public safety, but one that creates more jobs, more prosperity, and more educational opportunities for African Americans and all of our minority communities in the cities across the country. I mean, for the last three years, I'm proud to report to you that because of the policies that these congressmen supported and this President advanced, we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans in this country. We saw the creation of more than 8,000 Opportunity Zones generating billions of dollars in investment in underserved communities. And we're going to continue to work jobs and investment in our major cities in the country, not just for African Americans, but for every American. We're also going to address something that we learned about in the coronavirus pandemic. We saw, early on, as I led that task force, that the coronavirus was impacting African Americans and other minorities in a disproportionate manner. What the experts told us is that was evidence of historic disparities in healthcare among our neighbors in the African American community. So we're going to bring free market solutions to give minority communities more choices in healthcare to improve their lives. It's about jobs, it's about healthcare, but it's also about education. You know, the reality is today that many of our African American neighbors are required to send their kids to some of our most failing and dangerous schools. And that's why this President, this Vice President, and our administration are going to continue to fight every day to give African Americans and every American family the right to choose where your children go to school, whether it's public or private or parochial or religious. The American people believe they should decide where their children get their education. (Applause.) And we'll fight for it. So in the midst of all of this, I promise you we're going to continue, as I said before, to listen, to learn, to lead. And we'll form a more perfect union, which is America's ongoing mission. We'll put Americans back to work. We'll bring our nation together as we open up America again. You know, the comeback that we're celebrating today would not have been possible without all of the efforts and sacrifices that all of you have made and companies like this made. It would not have been possible without the leadership of President Donald Trump and the partnership that we forged with states across the country. I mean, this President, before there was a single coronavirus case in America, you all deserve to know President Trump shut down all travel from China. It bought us invaluable amount of time to stand up our national response. It's remarkable to think, also, that at the end of February, when he asked me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we'd actually performed only about 8,000 coronavirus tests in the entire country. But now, because of the public-private partnership that the President forged with American commercial laboratories, we're testing roughly 60 times that number every day. We're testing 500,000 Americans a day and have performed 23 million coronavirus tests - more than anywhere in the world. And we've been giving states what they need, when they need it. And I'm proud to you, working with the state of Michigan, we've delivered more than 560,000 million masks and gowns and face shields and personal protective equipment for our healthcare workers. But it was - it was those efforts by industry, those efforts by the President, mobilizing a whole-of-government approach, even a whole-of-America approach, that launched our national response to the coronavirus. But, ultimately, it was because of all of you that we are where we are today. Every single day, we're one day closer to putting the coronavirus in the past. Because of the sacrifices of millions of Americans who stayed home from work, school, from places of worship, who closed down businesses, putting the health of their employees, their customers and their community first, you made a real difference. And it's also a credit to the incredible healthcare workers in this country. I must tell you, the heroes of 2020 are the doctors, the nurses, the healthcare workers, and the first responders of America. They looked after our families as if they were their own. Oftentimes, without regard to their own personal safety they went into harm's way. And here at Chardam Gear and Casadei Steel, you did your part. Chardam Gear, I'm told, stayed open during this pandemic, didn't let go any of your employees at any point. Thank you for your commitment to your workers. And I'm proud to say the Payment Protection Program that these congressmen supported helped them do that. And we were proud to be able to partner with you, keep people on the payroll. And the President just extended Paycheck Protection just about a week ago. But it wasn't just about keeping people on the payroll to keep the people working. This company also - you also helped our healthcare workers. I heard all about it. I talked to one of the guys working at the company who figured out how to print 3D masks, safety glasses, and face shields. And though production did slow during the first few months, I know you're on your way back to full capacity. But let me just say thank you. Thank you to Chardam. Thank you to the Chardam team. Thank you for keeping this business rolling. But thank you for what you did for the health and wellbeing of the people in Michigan. We're grateful. And I'm also told that when a local General Motors plant came to Casadei and asked for help in building lifesaving ventilators, this company stepped up and helped to create a new facility to manufacture lifesaving ventilator parts. I mean, you met this moment with ingenuity and compassion and resolve. Because of your work, I was told this morning, General Motors is on track - as one of our partners, along with several other great companies - that GM, alone, with your help, is on track to build 30,000 ventilators by the month of August. And America is well on the way to producing 110,000 ventilators in less than 100 days. Thanks to all of you, because of American manufacturing, no American who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. (Applause.) And I want to thank you for that. You know, as I said, when the President tapped me to lead this coronavirus task force, he said he wanted a whole-of-government approach, government at every level - federal, state, and local. But it was clear to me what President Trump really meant was a whole-of-America approach. And the way that American manufacturing stepped up, even before being asked, is deeply inspiring. When I think of that war-like mobilization that created personal protective equipment that created ventilators, that stood up testing by the millions across the country, I only have - I only have three words to say: Only in America. (Applause.) Am I right? And people like all of you, people at Chardam and Casadei, you're really the living embodiment of American strength and resilience, both as a group but as individuals. I know it's personified in a man who, I was told, has spent over 30 years in manufacturing, who is a true Michigander through and through. I heard he worked his way up the ranks from machine leader, to nightshift foreman, to shop superintendent, to manufacturing coordinator. Now he actually leads the company as president of Chardam Gear. Would you join me in thanking Mike Brzoska? Where are you, Mike? Take a bow, will you? Thank you again. He's also, like, the son of Italian immigrants, whose parents came to America in pursuit of a better life 60 years ago. I'm told his parents boarded two separate ships that were named after our two great founding documents: the SS Constitution and the SS Independence. And their son would go on to found Casadei Steel in 2001. He built this company in one of the largest steel fabricators in the state of Michigan. It's a great American success story. And today, it just so happens to be his birthday. So would you join me in thanking Bruno Casadei? Thank you, Bruno. Thanks so much. (Applause.) And happy birthday. And while you're at it, while you're still clapping, why don't you join me in thanking his mom who is actually with us here today? Maria Casadei, are you with us? Take a bow, mom. (Applause.) What a great family. Come on, mom. Take a bow. (Applause.) What a great family, and what a great business. You know, we've all been through a lot in these past few months, but we responded just the American people always do: We came together, and we're moving forward. Because of the sacrifices that you made in those 45 Days to Slow the Spread, because of the way the people of Michigan and the people of America put the health of family members and neighbors and people they didn't even know first, because of the way businesses stepped up, put health first, and then also leaned in to make a difference as we stood up our national response, I'm proud to report to you, as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we slowed the spread, we flattened the curve, we cared for the most vulnerable, and we saved lives. And I promise you, in the days ahead, we're going to continue to create a solid foundation for whatever challenges may lie ahead, and we're going to it in a way that puts America back to work. Every single day, we're proving, as you are here in Michigan, that we can safely reopen America. And you have our thanks. It really is great to be back in Michigan. I'm going to let you all get out of the sun, and I got a plane to catch. I will tell you, I ordered a pizza to go at that restaurant, and we're going to be eating it on Air Force Two, Gene, just so you know. You know, we live in a - we live in challenging times - not just the months through which we have passed, but following weeks to which our nation has seen great strife, heartbreaking losses, inexplicable violence against innocent civilians, property, and law enforcement. Sometimes you turn on the television and it seems like there's more that divides in these United States than unites us. But I'll always believe that there's - there will always be more that unites us in this great country than could ever divide us. And chief among those virtues and values is this is a nation that loves freedom, and this is a nation of faith. As we see Americans stepping forward bravely, safely reopening their communities and their states and their businesses, it just reminds me what a freedom-loving country this is. I've been traveling around the nation, and I see the way the American people are stepping forward safely and responsibly showing that we can exercise common sense and exercise our freedom and move forward. And it's truly inspiring. But also, I would just say to each of you that maybe, from time to time, bow the head and bend the knee. If you're inclined to pray from time to time, I'd encourage you to pray for America during these challenging times. First off, I'd ask you to pray for all of the families that lost loved ones in the midst of this coronavirus and for all of those that have been challenged in these most recent days. You know, the Bible says, ""The Lord is close to the brokenhearted."" And that should be our prayer for all of those who've endured loss. I also encourage you to pray for all of those healthcare workers, first responders that, even at this very hour, are continuing to meet this moment with compassion and care and professionalism that inspires us each and every day. And lastly, I would just - I would just encourage you to just pray for all of the people of this country. The President said, not long ago, that we - as I said, he said we grieve together as a nation, but we heal together. You know, the Good Book says that if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, that He'll hear from heaven and He'll heal this land. So pray for America, and we will heal America and heal our land, as we put America back to work. So thank you all for coming out in the sunshine. I'm going to let you go cool off. But it is great to be back in Michigan. I want to thank these two great companies for the warm welcome as we begin this transition to greatness, this great American comeback. I'm absolutely confident that with President Donald Trump in the White House, with all the great men and women of Sterling Heights who are working hard to open up Michigan and open up America again, I just know the best days are yet to come for Michigan and America. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States. "	Well, hello, Michigan! And thank you to, really, one of the hardest working members of the President's Cabinet. He is a dedicated American who is focusing on improving the lives of workers, even in these challenging times. Would you join me in thanking the Secretary of Labor, Gene Scalia? He's doing phenomenal job for America. Thank you for those good words, Mr. Secretary. To Secretary Scalia, to Congressman John Moolenaar, Congressman Paul Mitchell, our great friends; to State Representatives Annette Glenn and Shane Hernandez; and all of the incredible men and women of Chardam Gear and Casadei Steel: It is great to be back in the Wolverine State. Thank you for coming out in the sunshine on this balmy June day. Thank you for being part of a great American comeback right here in Michigan. I just had a - I just had a great tour of these two great companies. Casadei Steel and Chardam Gear are two tremendous American businesses. I want to congratulate all of you for the job you do with these two great companies. Eighty-four years been building America with the steel that is American strength and providing the technology that's been providing for our national defense. And I have to say - I have to say, with these two great companies that contribute so much to a safe and secure America, as your Vice President and as the proud father of a United States Marine aviator who flies an aircraft, parts of which are made right here: Thank you for all of you do to keep America safe. It really is good to be with all of you, and I've had a great day in Michigan. I just - I just had lunch at the Engine House over in Mount Clemens. Opened up on Monday. I couldn't decide between a cheeseburger and pasta, so I had both. And I know, as of Monday, just like all of Michigan, restaurants are opening up in this great state because we're opening up America again. And before I go any further, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine - a man who loves the state of Michigan and loves manufacturing and steel like no other American I have ever met. Allow me to bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. You know, we've all passed through very challenging times over the last several months. But I'm proud to report to you, after all that we've been through, standing here today because of the sacrifices the American people have made, because of the incredible dedication of our healthcare workers, because of the way that American businesses stepped up, every state in this country is now opened up again, and three-quarters of America's small businesses are going back to work. The transition to greatness has begun. And we're building and rebuilding this economy on a strong foundation of what we were able to over the first three years of this administration. You know, when President Trump and I were spending time in Michigan back in 2016, he promised the people of Michigan that we'd cut taxes for working families and businesses large and small; that we'd roll back federal red tape; that we'd unleash American energy; that we'd fight for free and fair trade that puts American jobs and American workers first. And President Donald Trump delivered on every promise he made to the people of Michigan - - and we saw more than 7 million jobs created in the first three years. And I have to tell you, all of that progress would not have been possible without two friends that I mentioned right at the top. I wanted to give you one more opportunity to thank them. They are two principled conservative leaders. They've been partners with this administration every step of the way. They are deeply respected in the Congress of the United States. So would you join me one more time in thanking Congressman Paul Mitchell and Congressman Moolenaar. Stand up and take a bow, guys. Thank you so much. They've been delivering for Michigan for the last three and a half years, and the President and I are so grateful. And you know what? Because of that foundation that we laid, after all that we've been through as a nation over these last several months, the American comeback has begun. In fact, just a few short weeks ago, we actually saw, in the month of May alone, the largest one-month increase in jobs in American history. It's true. And the experts were all telling us - weren't they, Mr. Secretary? - that we could lose 8 million new jobs. In that report, they said that unemployment across the country might go from 14 percent to 20 percent, but actually, the American people proved them wrong. In the last month alone, America's businesses created nearly 3 million jobs. And we didn't stop there. Last week, the experts also predicted that retail sales would only grow by about 8 percent. But the American people - the American people knew they had 'another thing coming,'as we say down in the Hoosier State. They shattered expectations. Retail sales soared by 17.7 percent, the largest monthly increase in sales ever recorded. The American people are driving the great American comeback. And as I stand before you today, I want to make all of you a promise that the centerpiece of this transition to greatness - a centerpiece of this comeback - is going to be law and order in every community, in every state in the nation. What happened to George Floyd in Minnesota was a tragedy. It shocked the conscience of every American. There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. But there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting and violence that ensued in cities across this country. Now, like every American, we cherish and will always defend the First Amendment right. Every one of our countrymen. We respect the concerns of peaceful protesters. The people of Michigan know that most of the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best people in this country. And we'll stand with them. I mean, we're listening; we're learning. And the action the President took this week reflects that we're leading. But I'll make you all a promise: We're not going to defund the police. You know, my uncle was a police officer in Chicago, not real far from here, for his entire career. He's one of the heroes of my youth. But I'll tell you, every one of us knows that the men and women in law enforcement really are the best of us. They put on that uniform every day and they go and risk their lives to protect and serve your families. That's why the President and I sat down with leaders of law enforcement. We sat down with leaders in the African American community. And President Trump took action this week. He signed an executive order to make immediate resources and training available to police departments. We're going to work with law enforcement, work with our African Americans leaders and neighbors, and we're going to improve standards for the use of force for every community in the country. We're going to help our police to improve. We're also going to support law enforcement with resources and reform. But I promise you: We're not going to stop there. As President Trump said in Dallas last week, we're also going to work with the Congress to continue to move forward an agenda that not just includes public safety, but one that creates more jobs, more prosperity, and more educational opportunities for African Americans and all of our minority communities in the cities across the country. I mean, for the last three years, I'm proud to report to you that because of the policies that these congressmen supported and this President advanced, we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans in this country. We saw the creation of more than 8,000 Opportunity Zones generating billions of dollars in investment in underserved communities. And we're going to continue to work jobs and investment in our major cities in the country, not just for African Americans, but for every American. We're also going to address something that we learned about in the coronavirus pandemic. We saw, early on, as I led that task force, that the coronavirus was impacting African Americans and other minorities in a disproportionate manner. What the experts told us is that was evidence of historic disparities in healthcare among our neighbors in the African American community. So we're going to bring free market solutions to give minority communities more choices in healthcare to improve their lives. It's about jobs, it's about healthcare, but it's also about education. You know, the reality is today that many of our African American neighbors are required to send their kids to some of our most failing and dangerous schools. And that's why this President, this Vice President, and our administration are going to continue to fight every day to give African Americans and every American family the right to choose where your children go to school, whether it's public or private or parochial or religious. The American people believe they should decide where their children get their education. And we'll fight for it. So in the midst of all of this, I promise you we're going to continue, as I said before, to listen, to learn, to lead. And we'll form a more perfect union, which is America's ongoing mission. We'll put Americans back to work. We'll bring our nation together as we open up America again. You know, the comeback that we're celebrating today would not have been possible without all of the efforts and sacrifices that all of you have made and companies like this made. It would not have been possible without the leadership of President Donald Trump and the partnership that we forged with states across the country. I mean, this President, before there was a single coronavirus case in America, you all deserve to know President Trump shut down all travel from China. It bought us invaluable amount of time to stand up our national response. It's remarkable to think, also, that at the end of February, when he asked me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we'd actually performed only about 8,000 coronavirus tests in the entire country. But now, because of the public-private partnership that the President forged with American commercial laboratories, we're testing roughly 60 times that number every day. We're testing 500,000 Americans a day and have performed 23 million coronavirus tests - more than anywhere in the world. And we've been giving states what they need, when they need it. And I'm proud to you, working with the state of Michigan, we've delivered more than 560,000 million masks and gowns and face shields and personal protective equipment for our healthcare workers. But it was - it was those efforts by industry, those efforts by the President, mobilizing a whole-of-government approach, even a whole-of-America approach, that launched our national response to the coronavirus. But, ultimately, it was because of all of you that we are where we are today. Every single day, we're one day closer to putting the coronavirus in the past. Because of the sacrifices of millions of Americans who stayed home from work, school, from places of worship, who closed down businesses, putting the health of their employees, their customers and their community first, you made a real difference. And it's also a credit to the incredible healthcare workers in this country. I must tell you, the heroes of 2020 are the doctors, the nurses, the healthcare workers, and the first responders of America. They looked after our families as if they were their own. Oftentimes, without regard to their own personal safety they went into harm's way. And here at Chardam Gear and Casadei Steel, you did your part. Chardam Gear, I'm told, stayed open during this pandemic, didn't let go any of your employees at any point. Thank you for your commitment to your workers. And I'm proud to say the Payment Protection Program that these congressmen supported helped them do that. And we were proud to be able to partner with you, keep people on the payroll. And the President just extended Paycheck Protection just about a week ago. But it wasn't just about keeping people on the payroll to keep the people working. This company also - you also helped our healthcare workers. I heard all about it. I talked to one of the guys working at the company who figured out how to print 3D masks, safety glasses, and face shields. And though production did slow during the first few months, I know you're on your way back to full capacity. But let me just say thank you. Thank you to Chardam. Thank you to the Chardam team. Thank you for keeping this business rolling. But thank you for what you did for the health and wellbeing of the people in Michigan. We're grateful. And I'm also told that when a local General Motors plant came to Casadei and asked for help in building lifesaving ventilators, this company stepped up and helped to create a new facility to manufacture lifesaving ventilator parts. I mean, you met this moment with ingenuity and compassion and resolve. Because of your work, I was told this morning, General Motors is on track - as one of our partners, along with several other great companies - that GM, alone, with your help, is on track to build 30,000 ventilators by the month of August. And America is well on the way to producing 110,000 ventilators in less than 100 days. Thanks to all of you, because of American manufacturing, no American who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. And I want to thank you for that. You know, as I said, when the President tapped me to lead this coronavirus task force, he said he wanted a whole-of-government approach, government at every level - federal, state, and local. But it was clear to me what President Trump really meant was a whole-of-America approach. And the way that American manufacturing stepped up, even before being asked, is deeply inspiring. When I think of that war-like mobilization that created personal protective equipment that created ventilators, that stood up testing by the millions across the country, I only have - I only have three words to say: Only in America. Am I right? And people like all of you, people at Chardam and Casadei, you're really the living embodiment of American strength and resilience, both as a group but as individuals. I know it's personified in a man who, I was told, has spent over 30 years in manufacturing, who is a true Michigander through and through. I heard he worked his way up the ranks from machine leader, to nightshift foreman, to shop superintendent, to manufacturing coordinator. Now he actually leads the company as president of Chardam Gear. Would you join me in thanking Mike Brzoska? Where are you, Mike? Take a bow, will you? Thank you again. He's also, like, the son of Italian immigrants, whose parents came to America in pursuit of a better life 60 years ago. I'm told his parents boarded two separate ships that were named after our two great founding documents: the SS Constitution and the SS Independence. And their son would go on to found Casadei Steel in 2001. He built this company in one of the largest steel fabricators in the state of Michigan. It's a great American success story. And today, it just so happens to be his birthday. So would you join me in thanking Bruno Casadei? Thank you, Bruno. Thanks so much. And happy birthday. And while you're at it, while you're still clapping, why don't you join me in thanking his mom who is actually with us here today? Maria Casadei, are you with us? Take a bow, mom. What a great family. Come on, mom. Take a bow. What a great family, and what a great business. You know, we've all been through a lot in these past few months, but we responded just the American people always do: We came together, and we're moving forward. Because of the sacrifices that you made in those 45 Days to Slow the Spread, because of the way the people of Michigan and the people of America put the health of family members and neighbors and people they didn't even know first, because of the way businesses stepped up, put health first, and then also leaned in to make a difference as we stood up our national response, I'm proud to report to you, as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we slowed the spread, we flattened the curve, we cared for the most vulnerable, and we saved lives.

And God bless the United States.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?473207-1/vice-president-pence-remarks-michigan-reopening-economy	Vice President Mike Pence delivered remarks to employees at Casadei Steel Inc., on reopening the economy.	473207-1		
CSPANMP2362020132	Mike Pence	2020-06-23	Vice President Pence Remarks on Faith in America	Speech	"Well, hello, Wisconsin! (Applause.) You all look great. Thanks for coming out today. It is a joy to be with you today and to be with so many great friends, including someone that I admire maybe more than anyone I've met in public life. He served as governor of this great state. He is a national voice for all that we cherish and our conservative values. I know you heard from him today, but will you join me in thanking former Governor Scott Walker for all he's done for the Badger State and the United States? It's great to be here with him. Great to be here with the great Kellyanne Conway - (applause) - an amazing person. Amazing person. And also, there's two members of Congress here that have just absolutely been stalwarts for our administration every step of the way the last three and a half years. Would you join me in thanking Congressman Glenn Grothman and Congressman Bryan Steil? (Applause.) Great job, guys. And I also want to thank - he greeted me at the airport. I was on my way to a School Choice event. And, Governor, I actually learned that his mom was like the original sponsor, 30 years ago, of Wisconsin's historic School Choice program. Join me in thanking for her and for his leadership, Waukesha County Executive, Paul Farrow. Paul, thank you. (Applause.) And thank your mom. What a great family. But I want to thank all of you for coming out. I just saw the folks in overflow. I thanked them as well. I just want to say it is great to be back in the Badger State as we celebrate faith in America. (Applause.) And I'm here because I have faith in America, and I know that we have faith in the American people's hearts and minds. And before I begin, after mentioning all these important people, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine - (laughter) - someone who loves the state of Wisconsin, who actually is on his way to Arizona to mark the 212th mile in the southern border wall. (Applause.) But he's been a champion of people of faith and of the freedoms that we cherish. And, frankly, when I told him I was headed to Wisconsin - I was on Air Force Two; he was on Air Force One - I think he sounded just a little bit jealous. So allow me to bring greetings on his behalf and thanks for your support - past, present, and future - from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. And I want to tell you, I'm in Wisconsin today for really one reason and one reason only, and that is that Wisconsin and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. You know, like all of you - and I - thanks for standing there. That was just great. I can try that one more time. Anybody else here for four more years for President Donald Trump in the White House? (Applause.) That was all you. I love it. You know, like all of you are doing right now, I'm here because I stand with President Donald Trump. When this President stands up for American jobs and American workers, I stand with President Donald Trump. When this President stands for law and order and liberty and justice for all Americans, I stand with President Donald Trump. And when this President stands up for faith and family and life and the American flag, we stand with President Donald Trump. (Applause.) It's true. You know, four years ago, a movement was born - a movement made up of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And here, in Wisconsin, you believed we could be strong again. You believed we could be prosperous again. You said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016, and I know that Wisconsin is going to say yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in November of 2020. And it's because when you look at the record of the last three years, there's only one way you can describe it: It's been three and a half years of action, three and a half years of results. It's been three and a half years of promises made and promises kept. I mean, think about it: When the President and I were campaigning all across Wisconsin with Governor Walker and all the other great leaders that you have here, he was promising - he was promising to rebuild our military, to cut taxes for working families and small businesses. We said we'd roll back red tape, we'd unleash American energy, fight for free and fair trade, and that we would stand up for the values that have always made this country great. And on every single promise, President Donald Trump delivered. I mean, the economic agenda alone, in the first three years, we saw businesses large and small create more than 7 million jobs. And we saw manufacturing come roaring back all across the Heartland. I mean, remember back when Barack Obama and Joe Biden said that we needed a magic wand to bring manufacturing back? Well, we didn't need a magic wand in those first three years. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. Five hundred thousand manufacturing jobs created in the first three years alone. (Applause.) Amazing. And this economy - There you go. We had a manufacturing renaissance underway. We really did in those first three years. And maybe most important, remember when the President said that he was going to fight for the forgotten men and women of this country? I mean, the truth was, for many, many years, all across the Heartland, we, frankly, saw that while economies were growing or ebbing and flowing, the one thing that wasn't moving was the income of working families. And this President rolled his sleeves up and we went to work. And the truth of the matter is that not only were we seeing this economy expand, but we saw wages rising across the board for the American people. And what meant the most to the President and me was wages were rising in our first three years most rapidly for hardworking, blue-collar Americans. (Applause.) The forgotten men and women are forgotten no more. It was working. And unemployment was setting record lows, and we couldn't be more proud of the fact that, under this administration, in those first three years, we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. The American Dream is working again for every American. I mean, the economy alone was on an incredible roll. And then came the worst pandemic in 100 years that struck our country. It's been one of the most challenging times in the history of our country. But in the midst of that, even before the first coronavirus case was generated in this country, transmitted from one American to another, President Trump took action. He stood up the White House Coronavirus Task Force before January was out. And this President did what no other President had ever done before when he suspended all travel from China into the United States of America. I mean, the truth is, the President's action, unprecedented as it was, I can tell you firsthand, having led the coronavirus task force since late February, it bought our nation invaluable time to stand up a national response on virtually a wartime footing. I mean, under the President's leadership, America produced and delivered hundreds of millions of medical supplies to the incredible healthcare workers of this country in all 50 states. And let's hear it for our doctors, our nurses, and all of those that cared for our families. They are amazing Americans and they rose to the challenge. At the President's direction, we also reinvented testing from a standing start. I mean, literally, when I was tapped to lead the coronavirus task force, using the old model of lab-based testing, we'd only tested about 8,000 Americans for the coronavirus. But because the President brought the private sector together, commercial labs from all across the country, we're testing more than 500,000 Americans every single day. And we manufactured medical equipment on a wartime footing. I mean, working with great companies like GE Healthcare and General Motors and Ford, we rolled our sleeves up, they repurposed lines, we produced ventilators at an unprecedented rate, and no American who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. Under the President's leadership, we met this moment and we're meeting this moment with American compassion, with ingenuity, with courage, and with faith. And because of the foundation that we laid in this economy, as I stand here today, some 40 states, just like Wisconsin, are opening up again. (Applause.) We're putting Americans back to work. It's a testament to the resilience of the American people that we see cases that are stable or even declining in 40 states across the country. We have some outbreaks in the South, and we're focusing energy on those. But all 50 states are opening up again. All 50 states are putting America back to work. And because of the strength and the resilience of the American people after all that we've been through as a nation, it's remarkable to think that, in the month of May alone, we had the largest one-month increase in jobs in American history: 2.5 million jobs created all across America. You know, the great American comeback has begun, and President Trump is leading the way. (Applause.) It's true. And under this President's leadership, we built the greatest economy in history, and this President is going to do it again. (Applause.) Now, Joe Biden and the Democrats, they have their plan. Now, remember, Joe Biden and Barack Obama, in their time, presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. I mean, literally created jobs at a slower pace of any time post-recession nearly in the last 100 years. And back then, just like Joe Biden intends to do right now, their prescription for putting Americans back to work: Joe Biden wants to raise your taxes. Joe Biden wants to roll out an avalanche of regulations. Things like the Green New Deal, right? He wants to stifle American energy. And get back to the old days of economic surrender to China. Well, that's not going to happen because we're going to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years in the White House. (Applause.) We're going to cut taxes, roll back regulation, unleash American energy, and fight for free and fair trade every day. (Applause.) We did it before, and we're going to do it again. For those - the economy is just part of the story. You know, I have to tell you, to provide for the common defense is the first object of the federal government, and this President, from early on, has been leading the way. And after years of budget cutbacks that literally saw - there was a portion of our aircraft in the United States Air Force when we were sworn in on Inauguration Day that were actually grounded so they could use these airplanes as spare parts to keep other planes in the air. Well, President Donald Trump changed all that. (Applause.) This President has signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We've rebuilt our military. We've restored the arsenal of democracy, and we're once again given our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guard the resources and the support that they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe. And I can tell you, it's a - it means so much to all of us, I know, to have a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces. You know, I'm your Vice President, but the highest title I'll ever hold is D-A-D. And I'm the proud father of a United States Marine. (Applause.) And I'm the father-in-law of a United States Navy pilot. And I couldn't be more proud to serve with a President who cares about our men and women in uniform and all of our veterans all across America. I mean, our troops got the largest pay raise they'd gotten in about 10 years under this President's signature. And also we're making sure that we're going to remain as dominant in the heavens as we are on land and sea and Earth because this President started and created the Space Force. I was actually - I spoke at the graduation - Scott, I spoke at the graduation of the United States Air Force Academy, and I got to swear in the first 85 commissioned officers in the United States Space Force. (Applause.) We're rolling. And how about the support for veterans? You know, when we took office, I'll never forget - traveling across Wisconsin, traveling across America, we heard - we heard heartbreaking stories of long waiting lists for people to get into VA facilities. We actually heard tale of veterans passing away while they were waiting for treatment at the VA. Well, those days are over. This President signed the VA Accountability Act. We have fired thousands of employees from the VA that weren't giving our veterans the healthcare they deserved, and Veterans Choice is now available to every veteran in America. (Applause.) We're giving our veterans access to the world-class healthcare that you earned in the uniform of the United States. We love our vets. And how about - could the veterans among us, if you're able, would you mind standing and just given us a chance to say thank you one more time? Thank you for your service. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you for your service. Thank you, sir. Thank you for your service. And I have to tell you, it hasn't just been about our national defense and our economy. This President - this President also been out there fighting for equality of opportunity in education for families all across this country. You know, Kellyanne and I were just at a great event at the Waukesha STEM Academy. And we were talking about the fact that Wisconsin has led the way - has led the way in educational choice for more than 30 years, but it was Governor Scott Walker that took it statewide for families in this state. (Applause.) Thank you, Governor. You know, the President and I have long believed that - have long believed that every parent should be able to choose where their children go to school, regardless of their area code and income. And Wisconsin, with a great leadership that you've had here, from Governor Tommy Thompson to Governor Scott Walker, you've been leading the way. This President, this Vice President, Secretary Betsy DeVos, and our entire team are going to work to expand educational choice to every family in America. (Applause.) But thank you for leading, Wisconsin. And thank you, Governor. And it's been - it's also been about the rule of law, and law and order, under this President from day one. You know, I think you all know what most Americans know: The men and women who serve in law enforcement - most of the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best people in this country. (Applause.) And we honor their service and their courage every day. We do. I mean, every American knows what happened to George Floyd was a tragedy. It shocked the conscience of the nation, and justice will be served. (Applause.) There's was no excuse to what happened to George Floyd, but there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting and violence that ensued in cities across America. Weeks ago, when rioting and looting was overwhelming many of our major cities, Joe Biden sent out a press release. President Donald Trump sent in the National Guard. (Applause.) He secured our nation's capital and called on every governor in America to do the same, and we quelled the violence. And in the days that followed, we've been sitting down with law enforcement. We've been listening to leaders in the African American community. We're looking for ways, as the President articulated about a week ago in his executive order, to improve public safety and improve the lives of our African American neighbors. We're listening, we're learning, and we're leading. But we're not going to defund the police. So it's been about law and order and the rule of law. And that also means that it's been about making sure that the men and women who sit on our courts at every level uphold the Constitution of the United States as written. And this week, President Trump will nominate his 200th judge to the federal courts of the United States. And I can tell you they are all men and women who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. We've made so much progress over the last three and a half years in strengthening the constitutional foundations of our federal courts, the principles to which they adhere. But as we've been reminded over the past few weeks, we have more work to do. We need more conservatives on the Supreme Court of the United States. So we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House! (Applause.) That's exactly why. It's exactly why this president just announced a couple of days ago, just like he did four years ago, that he's going to release a list of principled conservative nominees that we will nominate to our courts at every level in the second term of the Trump administration. (Applause.) So, get ready. So we've stood for a strong national defense, a growing economy, the rule of law, and our most cherished constitutional principles. But what brings us here today is that this President, like no other president in my lifetime, has stood and defended our first freedom, the freedom of religion. You know, I like to tell people that - I like to tell people I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order. (Laughter and applause.) And I couldn't be more proud to be Vice President to a President who has stood strong for faith and freedom in America. (Applause.) He has, every day. As the President said that last Saturday in Tulsa, and I quote, ""We will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as Americans. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe in faith and family,"" he said, ""not in government and bureaucracy."" And we live by the words of our national motto, ""In God We Trust."" I mean, you have a President and you have a Vice President and an administration that understand that the greatness of America doesn't come from the corridors of government or our bustling factories, so much as it comes from the character and the faith of the American people. And this President and our administration, from day one, in one instance after another, have been defending that freedom and defending those values every step of the way. I mean, from early on in this administration, the President took steps. He took steps to end the last administration's assault on the little Sisters of the Poor. And then there was the peace cross. Did you hear about that one? It was what was called a peace cross in Maryland. It was built decades ago to honor fallen heroes in World War One, but left-wing activists wanted to take it down. Well, President Trump took action, we stood strong, and the Supreme Court voted 7 to 2, and the peace cross is standing today. (Applause.) It's true. And you may not have heard about this one: Under the last administration, Bibles were actually being removed from VA hospital rooms and even displays. There was a display of a missing man table - you know what that is - it was in the lobby of the New Hampshire VA. And some group sent a letter and said that you got to take that Bible - it was an Army-issued Bible - off the table. But President Trump took action. He took action, and we issued a new policy that allowed not only for the display of Bibles, but we made sure Christmas carols and prayer can happen all across our VA hospitals - (applause) - and when President Trump said, ""The Bible stays."" So he's been standing up for our freedoms here at home, but he's been standing up some of our most cherished ideals as well. You know, four presidents in a row had made a promise to the American people concerning our most cherished ally, but it was President Donald Trump who kept the promise when he moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. (Applause.) Under this President, if the world knows nothing else, the world knows this: America stands with Israel. So we've stood with people of faith all across this country, of every faith, for that first freedom and for the ideals that we cherish. Now, there's one issue that means more to me than maybe anyone else, and that is that this President has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.) True. And the contrast with the Democratic Party of Joe Biden could not be more stark. I heard Joe Biden was just endorsed by Planned Parenthood of America. And Joe Biden supports abortion on demand and even changed his historic position to now support taxpayer funding of abortion. And I must tell you - I must tell you, this President has stood strong for the sanctity of life, and it was my great honor to cast the tiebreaking vote to allow states like Wisconsin to defund Planned Parenthood. (Applause.) We will stand for life in this administration every day. So standing up for life and for liberty and for our most cherished values is at the very heart - at the very heart of the work that this President has done. And I know that people have faith all across this country know it. And in these troubled times, for what we've seen over the past several weeks, maybe now it's more important than ever. You know, just last night, just across the street from the White House, vandals defaced St. John's Church again, after trying to set it afire a few weeks ago. They also tried to tear down the statue of President Andrew Jackson. Burning churches is not protest. Desecrating synagogues is not free speech. There will be no tolerance for vandalism or violence in the United States. (Applause.) We will prosecute those who do it to the fullest extent of the law. So we've had an incredible story to tell. Now it's your turn, Wisconsin, to tell it again. It's a story about American strength, about American jobs, about America enduring the great trial of the last four months. It's about law and order. It's about liberties and life. And it's about deciding right here and right now that we're going to defeat Joe Biden on November 3rd - (applause) - and reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. I mean, I can tell you I don't think it'd be news to anybody in this room that you elected a fighter to be President of the United States. And he's been fighting for you every single day. Wisconsin, now it's - now it's our turn to fight for him. (Applause.) It's on. It's on. So I need you to bring all the same enthusiasm. Keep voicing your support. Keep talking to your neighbors and your friends every day. We got about four months and two weeks to get this thing done in Wisconsin and all across the country. And I know you will - I know you will do it. I mean, because the truth of the matter is that we're - for all that we've done as a nation, for all that we've been through, we're just getting started. I mean, think about it: When you're talking to your neighbors and friends, remind them that four more years means more support for our troops. Four more years means more jobs. Four more years means more judges. And it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp. So, Wisconsin, I need you to bring it. The silent majority can be silent no more! No, this has really been great. I appreciate you all coming out. And let me also say to overflow: Thank you for coming out. I'll tell you, as I've traveled across this country - and I've traveled a lot over the last three and a half years; four, if you count the campaign - and for this small-town boy from southern Indiana, I'm more convinced than ever of two things: that this is a freedom-loving nation, and this is a nation of faith. It truly is. I mean, when you see the way the American people are stepping forward in the wake of all that we've been through over the last four months, we're safely and responsibly reclaiming our businesses, reclaiming our community lives. And it's truly inspiring but not surprising, because the American people love freedom. We forfeited some of our personal freedom to put the health of our families and our neighbors first, and we know we're going to continue to be - to use common sense as we go forward in the days ahead. But I see that - I see that love of freedom everywhere I go, in all 50 states, as we see this great American comeback as we're opening up America again. But let me also say, I just know, as the President says many times, this is a nation of faith. I mean, the sweetest words that I ever hear, and I know the sweetest words the President ever hears, are when people walk up to you, maybe speak across a rope line or drop an email, send a letter, is when people say, ""I'm praying for you."" (Applause.) And you know they are. I hear those words. I literally hear them every day as I travel across this country. And I never fail to be deeply moved. And so I just want to encourage each one of you, as we talk about the records, as we talk about the progress, as we talk about the choice in the next four months and two days: I hope you'll take time to talk to the one who has always had his hand on this great nation. And on this one - and on this one, I hope you permit me to say I'm not really asking you to pray for the cause or pray for an outcome. I'm just saying, in these divided times in the life of our nation, in these times where we've endured such great challenges, through this pandemic, I just encourage you to pray for America. Pray for all the American people. And when you pray, be confident. Be confident, as we face challenges in health and challenges in our public discourse, that if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, He'll do like He's always done through the long and storied history of this country: He'll hear from heaven and He'll heal this land, this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. (Applause.) So, pray for all the American people. Well, I'm going to slip away. I've got a plane to catch. I'm going to head back to Washington, D.C., but I can't wait to tell him about you people tonight, with the enthusiasm we see here in Wisconsin. And I'm absolutely convinced that if all of us do all that we need to do in the next four months and two weeks to tell the story of this President, to lay out the choice to the people of Wisconsin, to work and to pray, I know we're going to have President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years. We're going to make this country more prosperous than ever before. We're going to make this country more secure than ever before. We're going to bring America together as never before. And we're going make America great again, again! Thanks, everybody. God bless you, and God bless America."	Well, hello, Wisconsin! You all look great. Thanks for coming out today. It is a joy to be with you today and to be with so many great friends, including someone that I admire maybe more than anyone I've met in public life. He served as governor of this great state. He is a national voice for all that we cherish and our conservative values. I know you heard from him today, but will you join me in thanking former Governor Scott Walker for all he's done for the Badger State and the United States? It's great to be here with him. Great to be here with the great Kellyanne Conway - - an amazing person. Amazing person. And also, there's two members of Congress here that have just absolutely been stalwarts for our administration every step of the way the last three and a half years. Would you join me in thanking Congressman Glenn Grothman and Congressman Bryan Steil? Great job, guys. And I also want to thank - he greeted me at the airport. I was on my way to a School Choice event. And, Governor, I actually learned that his mom was like the original sponsor, 30 years ago, of Wisconsin's historic School Choice program. Join me in thanking for her and for his leadership, Waukesha County Executive, Paul Farrow. Paul, thank you. And thank your mom. What a great family. But I want to thank all of you for coming out. I just saw the folks in overflow. I thanked them as well. I just want to say it is great to be back in the Badger State as we celebrate faith in America. And I'm here because I have faith in America, and I know that we have faith in the American people's hearts and minds. And before I begin, after mentioning all these important people, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine - - someone who loves the state of Wisconsin, who actually is on his way to Arizona to mark the 212th mile in the southern border wall. But he's been a champion of people of faith and of the freedoms that we cherish. And, frankly, when I told him I was headed to Wisconsin - I was on Air Force Two; he was on Air Force One - I think he sounded just a little bit jealous. So allow me to bring greetings on his behalf and thanks for your support - past, present, and future - from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. And I want to tell you, I'm in Wisconsin today for really one reason and one reason only, and that is that Wisconsin and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. You know, like all of you - and I - thanks for standing there. That was just great. I can try that one more time. Anybody else here for four more years for President Donald Trump in the White House? That was all you. I love it. You know, like all of you are doing right now, I'm here because I stand with President Donald Trump. When this President stands up for American jobs and American workers, I stand with President Donald Trump. When this President stands for law and order and liberty and justice for all Americans, I stand with President Donald Trump. And when this President stands up for faith and family and life and the American flag, we stand with President Donald Trump. It's true. You know, four years ago, a movement was born - a movement made up of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And here, in Wisconsin, you believed we could be strong again. You believed we could be prosperous again. You said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016, and I know that Wisconsin is going to say yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in November of 2020. And it's because when you look at the record of the last three years, there's only one way you can describe it: It's been three and a half years of action, three and a half years of results. It's been three and a half years of promises made and promises kept. I mean, think about it: When the President and I were campaigning all across Wisconsin with Governor Walker and all the other great leaders that you have here, he was promising - he was promising to rebuild our military, to cut taxes for working families and small businesses. We said we'd roll back red tape, we'd unleash American energy, fight for free and fair trade, and that we would stand up for the values that have always made this country great. And on every single promise, President Donald Trump delivered. I mean, the economic agenda alone, in the first three years, we saw businesses large and small create more than 7 million jobs. And we saw manufacturing come roaring back all across the Heartland. I mean, remember back when Barack Obama and Joe Biden said that we needed a magic wand to bring manufacturing back? Well, we didn't need a magic wand in those first three years. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. Five hundred thousand manufacturing jobs created in the first three years alone. Amazing. And this economy - There you go. We had a manufacturing renaissance underway. We really did in those first three years. And maybe most important, remember when the President said that he was going to fight for the forgotten men and women of this country? I mean, the truth was, for many, many years, all across the Heartland, we, frankly, saw that while economies were growing or ebbing and flowing, the one thing that wasn't moving was the income of working families. And this President rolled his sleeves up and we went to work. And the truth of the matter is that not only were we seeing this economy expand, but we saw wages rising across the board for the American people. And what meant the most to the President and me was wages were rising in our first three years most rapidly for hardworking, blue-collar Americans. The forgotten men and women are forgotten no more. It was working. And unemployment was setting record lows, and we couldn't be more proud of the fact that, under this administration, in those first three years, we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. The American Dream is working again for every American. I mean, the economy alone was on an incredible roll. And then came the worst pandemic in 100 years that struck our country. It's been one of the most challenging times in the history of our country. But in the midst of that, even before the first coronavirus case was generated in this country, transmitted from one American to another, President Trump took action. He stood up the White House Coronavirus Task Force before January was out. And this President did what no other President had ever done before when he suspended all travel from China into the United States of America. I mean, the truth is, the President's action, unprecedented as it was, I can tell you firsthand, having led the coronavirus task force since late February, it bought our nation invaluable time to stand up a national response on virtually a wartime footing. I mean, under the President's leadership, America produced and delivered hundreds of millions of medical supplies to the incredible healthcare workers of this country in all 50 states. And let's hear it for our doctors, our nurses, and all of those that cared for our families. They are amazing Americans and they rose to the challenge. At the President's direction, we also reinvented testing from a standing start. I mean, literally, when I was tapped to lead the coronavirus task force, using the old model of lab-based testing, we'd only tested about 8,000 Americans for the coronavirus. But because the President brought the private sector together, commercial labs from all across the country, we're testing more than 500,000 Americans every single day. And we manufactured medical equipment on a wartime footing. I mean, working with great companies like GE Healthcare and General Motors and Ford, we rolled our sleeves up, they repurposed lines, we produced ventilators at an unprecedented rate, and no American who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. Under the President's leadership, we met this moment and we're meeting this moment with American compassion, with ingenuity, with courage, and with faith. And because of the foundation that we laid in this economy, as I stand here today, some 40 states, just like Wisconsin, are opening up again. We're putting Americans back to work. It's a testament to the resilience of the American people that we see cases that are stable or even declining in 40 states across the country. We have some outbreaks in the South, and we're focusing energy on those. But all 50 states are opening up again. All 50 states are putting America back to work. And because of the strength and the resilience of the American people after all that we've been through as a nation, it's remarkable to think that, in the month of May alone, we had the largest one-month increase in jobs in American history: 2.5 million jobs created all across America. You know, the great American comeback has begun, and President Trump is leading the way. It's true. And under this President's leadership, we built the greatest economy in history, and this President is going to do it again. Now, Joe Biden and the Democrats, they have their plan. Now, remember, Joe Biden and Barack Obama, in their time, presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. I mean, literally created jobs at a slower pace of any time post-recession nearly in the last 100 years. And back then, just like Joe Biden intends to do right now, their prescription for putting Americans back to work: Joe Biden wants to raise your taxes. Joe Biden wants to roll out an avalanche of regulations. Things like the Green New Deal, right? He wants to stifle American energy. And get back to the old days of economic surrender to China. Well, that's not going to happen because we're going to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years in the White House. We're going to cut taxes, roll back regulation, unleash American energy, and fight for free and fair trade every day. We did it before, and we're going to do it again. For those - the economy is just part of the story. You know, I have to tell you, to provide for the common defense is the first object of the federal government, and this President, from early on, has been leading the way. And after years of budget cutbacks that literally saw - there was a portion of our aircraft in the United States Air Force when we were sworn in on Inauguration Day that were actually grounded so they could use these airplanes as spare parts to keep other planes in the air. Well, President Donald Trump changed all that. This President has signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We've rebuilt our military. We've restored the arsenal of democracy, and we're once again given our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guard the resources and the support that they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe. And I can tell you, it's a - it means so much to all of us, I know, to have a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces. You know, I'm your Vice President, but the highest title I'll ever hold is D-A-D. And I'm the proud father of a United States Marine. And I'm the father-in-law of a United States Navy pilot. And I couldn't be more proud to serve with a President who cares about our men and women in uniform and all of our veterans all across America. I mean, our troops got the largest pay raise they'd gotten in about 10 years under this President's signature. And also we're making sure that we're going to remain as dominant in the heavens as we are on land and sea and Earth because this President started and created the Space Force. I was actually - I spoke at the graduation - Scott, I spoke at the graduation of the United States Air Force Academy, and I got to swear in the first 85 commissioned officers in the United States Space Force. We're rolling. And how about the support for veterans? You know, when we took office, I'll never forget - traveling across Wisconsin, traveling across America, we heard - we heard heartbreaking stories of long waiting lists for people to get into VA facilities. We actually heard tale of veterans passing away while they were waiting for treatment at the VA. Well, those days are over. This President signed the VA Accountability Act. We have fired thousands of employees from the VA that weren't giving our veterans the healthcare they deserved, and Veterans Choice is now available to every veteran in America. We're giving our veterans access to the world-class healthcare that you earned in the uniform of the United States. We love our vets. And how about - could the veterans among us, if you're able, would you mind standing and just given us a chance to say thank you one more time? Thank you for your service. Thank you. Thank you for your service. Thank you, sir. Thank you for your service. And I have to tell you, it hasn't just been about our national defense and our economy. This President - this President also been out there fighting for equality of opportunity in education for families all across this country. You know, Kellyanne and I were just at a great event at the Waukesha STEM Academy. And we were talking about the fact that Wisconsin has led the way - has led the way in educational choice for more than 30 years, but it was Governor Scott Walker that took it statewide for families in this state. Thank you, Governor. You know, the President and I have long believed that - have long believed that every parent should be able to choose where their children go to school, regardless of their area code and income. And Wisconsin, with a great leadership that you've had here, from Governor Tommy Thompson to Governor Scott Walker, you've been leading the way. This President, this Vice President, Secretary Betsy DeVos, and our entire team are going to work to expand educational choice to every family in America. But thank you for leading, Wisconsin. And thank you, Governor. And it's been - it's also been about the rule of law, and law and order, under this President from day one. You know, I think you all know what most Americans know: The men and women who serve in law enforcement - most of the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best people in this country. And we honor their service and their courage every day. We do. I mean, every American knows what happened to George Floyd was a tragedy. It shocked the conscience of the nation, and justice will be served.

We're looking for ways, as the President articulated about a week ago in his executive order, to improve public safety and improve the lives of our African American neighbors. We're listening, we're learning, and we're leading. But we're not going to defund the police. So it's been about law and order and the rule of law. And that also means that it's been about making sure that the men and women who sit on our courts at every level uphold the Constitution of the United States as written. And this week, President Trump will nominate his 200th judge to the federal courts of the United States. And I can tell you they are all men and women who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. We've made so much progress over the last three and a half years in strengthening the constitutional foundations of our federal courts, the principles to which they adhere. But as we've been reminded over the past few weeks, we have more work to do. We need more conservatives on the Supreme Court of the United States. So we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House! That's exactly why. It's exactly why this president just announced a couple of days ago, just like he did four years ago, that he's going to release a list of principled conservative nominees that we will nominate to our courts at every level in the second term of the Trump administration. So, get ready. So we've stood for a strong national defense, a growing economy, the rule of law, and our most cherished constitutional principles. But what brings us here today is that this President, like no other president in my lifetime, has stood and defended our first freedom, the freedom of religion. You know, I like to tell people that - I like to tell people I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order. And I couldn't be more proud to be Vice President to a President who has stood strong for faith and freedom in America. He has, every day. As the President said that last Saturday in Tulsa, and I quote, 'We will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as Americans.

And this President and our administration, from day one, in one instance after another, have been defending that freedom and defending those values every step of the way. I mean, from early on in this administration, the President took steps. He took steps to end the last administration's assault on the little Sisters of the Poor. And then there was the peace cross. Did you hear about that one? It was what was called a peace cross in Maryland. It was built decades ago to honor fallen heroes in World War One, but left-wing activists wanted to take it down. Well, President Trump took action, we stood strong, and the Supreme Court voted 7 to 2, and the peace cross is standing today. It's true. And you may not have heard about this one: Under the last administration, Bibles were actually being removed from VA hospital rooms and even displays. There was a display of a missing man table - you know what that is - it was in the lobby of the New Hampshire VA. And some group sent a letter and said that you got to take that Bible - it was an Army-issued Bible - off the table. But President Trump took action. He took action, and we issued a new policy that allowed not only for the display of Bibles, but we made sure Christmas carols and prayer can happen all across our VA hospitals - - and when President Trump said, 'The Bible stays.' So he's been standing up for our freedoms here at home, but he's been standing up some of our most cherished ideals as well. You know, four presidents in a row had made a promise to the American people concerning our most cherished ally, but it was President Donald Trump who kept the promise when he moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. Under this President, if the world knows nothing else, the world knows this: America stands with Israel. So we've stood with people of faith all across this country, of every faith, for that first freedom and for the ideals that we cherish. Now, there's one issue that means more to me than maybe anyone else, and that is that this President has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. True. And the contrast with the Democratic Party of Joe Biden could not be more stark. I heard Joe Biden was just endorsed by Planned Parenthood of America. And Joe Biden supports abortion on demand and even changed his historic position to now support taxpayer funding of abortion. And I must tell you - I must tell you, this President has stood strong for the sanctity of life, and it was my great honor to cast the tiebreaking vote to allow states like Wisconsin to defund Planned Parenthood. We will stand for life in this administration every day. So standing up for life and for liberty and for our most cherished values is at the very heart - at the very heart of the work that this President has done. And I know that people have faith all across this country know it. And in these troubled times, for what we've seen over the past several weeks, maybe now it's more important than ever. You know, just last night, just across the street from the White House, vandals defaced St. John's Church again, after trying to set it afire a few weeks ago. They also tried to tear down the statue of President Andrew Jackson. Burning churches is not protest. Desecrating synagogues is not free speech. There will be no tolerance for vandalism or violence in the United States. We will prosecute those who do it to the fullest extent of the law. So we've had an incredible story to tell. Now it's your turn, Wisconsin, to tell it again. It's a story about American strength, about American jobs, about America enduring the great trial of the last four months. It's about law and order. It's about liberties and life. And it's about deciding right here and right now that we're going to defeat Joe Biden on November 3rd - - and reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. I mean, I can tell you I don't think it'd be news to anybody in this room that you elected a fighter to be President of the United States. And he's been fighting for you every single day. Wisconsin, now it's - now it's our turn to fight for him. It's on. It's on. So I need you to bring all the same enthusiasm. Keep voicing your support. Keep talking to your neighbors and your friends every day. We got about four months and two weeks to get this thing done in Wisconsin and all across the country. And I know you will - I know you will do it. I mean, because the truth of the matter is that we're - for all that we've done as a nation, for all that we've been through, we're just getting started. I mean, think about it: When you're talking to your neighbors and friends, remind them that four more years means more support for our troops. Four more years means more jobs. Four more years means more judges. And it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp. So, Wisconsin, I need you to bring it. The silent majority can be silent no more! No, this has really been great. I appreciate you all coming out. And let me also say to overflow: Thank you for coming out. I'll tell you, as I've traveled across this country - and I've traveled a lot over the last three and a half years; four, if you count the campaign - and for this small-town boy from southern Indiana, I'm more convinced than ever of two things: that this is a freedom-loving nation, and this is a nation of faith. It truly is. I mean, when you see the way the American people are stepping forward in the wake of all that we've been through over the last four months, we're safely and responsibly reclaiming our businesses, reclaiming our community lives. And it's truly inspiring but not surprising, because the American people love freedom. We forfeited some of our personal freedom to put the health of our families and our neighbors first, and we know we're going to continue to be - to use common sense as we go forward in the days ahead. But I see that - I see that love of freedom everywhere I go, in all 50 states, as we see this great American comeback as we're opening up America again. But let me also say, I just know, as the President says many times, this is a nation of faith. I mean, the sweetest words that I ever hear, and I know the sweetest words the President ever hears, are when people walk up to you, maybe speak across a rope line or drop an email, send a letter, is when people say, 'I'm praying for you.' And you know they are. I hear those words. I literally hear them every day as I travel across this country. And I never fail to be deeply moved. And so I just want to encourage each one of you, as we talk about the records, as we talk about the progress, as we talk about the choice in the next four months and two days: I hope you'll take time to talk to the one who has always had his hand on this great nation. And on this one - and on this one, I hope you permit me to say I'm not really asking you to pray for the cause or pray for an outcome. I'm just saying, in these divided times in the life of our nation, in these times where we've endured such great challenges, through this pandemic, I just encourage you to pray for America. Pray for all the American people. And when you pray, be confident. Be confident, as we face challenges in health and challenges in our public discourse, that if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, He'll do like He's always done through the long and storied history of this country: He'll hear from heaven and He'll heal this land, this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. So, pray for all the American people. Well, I'm going to slip away. I've got a plane to catch. I'm going to head back to Washington, D.C., but I can't wait to tell him about you people tonight, with the enthusiasm we see here in Wisconsin. And I'm absolutely convinced that if all of us do all that we need to do in the next four months and two weeks to tell the story of this President, to lay out the choice to the people of Wisconsin, to work and to pray, I know we're going to have President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years. We're going to make this country more prosperous than ever before. We're going to make this country more secure than ever before. We're going to bring America together as never before. And we're going make America great again, again! Thanks, everybody. God bless you, and God bless America.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?473326-1/vice-president-pence-remarks-faith-america	Vice President Pence delivered remarks on faith in America in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.	473326-1		
CSPANMP2562020133	Mike Pence	2020-06-25	Vice President Pence Remarks at Youngstown Police Department	Speech	Thank you so much. Thank you for the - thank you for the warm welcome. But first and foremost, let me say: I had to stop by the Youngstown Police Department at the shift change to make it clear to each and every one of you, on behalf of the President of the United States and on behalf of a grateful nation, that we stand with the men and women of law enforcement and we always will. I promise you that. I want to thank Chief Robin Lees for your leadership and for the great example that this department has provided. I know you're at a shift change; some of you are coming on, and some of you're coming off. But I still couldn't resist the opportunity to come by and just say thank you to the Youngstown Police Department for the example that you're setting in community relations and in demonstrating that we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African American community. We can support law enforcement, we can support our African American community, we can come together around better public safety. And that's what law enforcement want, and that's what every American wants. And to each and every one of you, I just simply want to say thanks. Thank you for what you do every day, you know. And I want to assure you that the American people know - the American people know that most of you who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best people in this country. You put on that uniform, and you walk out, you leave your families behind, and you protect and serve. You count our lives as more important than your own, and every American cherishes that. But I think they also know that you are always looking to improve public safety. I think we all recognize - every American, I believe in my heart, knows that what happened to George Floyd was a tragedy. And there's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis, but there's also no excuse for the rioting and the violence and the looting and the attacks on law enforcement that have followed. I mean, justice will be served in that case. But I want to I want to pledge to each one of you: We're also going to look for ways to provide more resources to departments just like this one here in Youngstown. And you all have been setting an example, in an innovative program here, about use of force training and de-escalation. And I just wanted to come by. And to Chief - Chief Lees, and to your mayor, and to everyone involved in this department, I wanted to say thank you for setting the example - the way members of this department have to take a training exam every year, and the way - I think, most inspirationally - you've opened up the training to the public and to community leaders like Derrick McDowell. And I want to thank Derrick, who I know is with us here today. Thank you for leaning in. Thank you for supporting law enforcement and improving public safety for all the people in this community, Derrick. We're truly grateful. I also know that the Youngstown Police has been a great partner in reducing crime with a man who has been leading efforts, mentoring countless young men here in Youngstown for some time. He's the head of the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence and I know he's working with each and every one of you to make our streets safer each and every day. Join me in thanking Guy Burney. Guy, where are you? You've also had a strong partner, Chief, I'm told, in a local football coach - who's been working with you and who has invited Youngstown police officers to work out with his team and to build the kind of relationships with players at Chaney High School that will facilitate stronger bonds between those who protect and serve and those who are served. And so I just also - I was inspired to hear about it, but I wanted to thank Chaney High School, and especially Coach Chris Amill. Where are you, Coach? Great job. That's great leadership. (Applause.) It really is inspiring. In each one of these cases, the Youngstown Police Department has been setting an example not just here in Ohio, but all across the country - an example of a commitment to improving policing in the community, but doing it in a way that is continuously strengthening ties with all of our citizens. I mean, the reality is that I never met a police officer that didn't want to do better. You all answered the call to serve - to serve your community. And the way you've stepped up here and the way the Youngstown Police Department is leading by example is making a real difference for the country. We're going to continue to work. As you saw, President Trump, a little more than a week ago, signed an executive order to make more resources available for training on the use of force to create greater accountability. You know, my uncle was a police officer in Chicago for 25 years, and I know nobody hates bad cops more than good cops. And I want to promise you that, in the days ahead, we're going to be looking for ways to provide more resources to the law enforcement community, to have the kind of training and the accountability that each and every one of you desire and aspire to make real in your careers. And let me be very clear on one point: There are some in the public debate who think we've got to choose between supporting law enforcement or supporting our African American neighbors. And what you're doing here in Youngstown every day is showing we don't have to make that choice. In fact, what we're going to do is we're going to support law enforcement and our African American families, and we're going to bring our community, our state, and our nation together around better public safety. So we're not going to defund the police. We're going to fund better policing and give you the tools and the resources - and, frankly, give other departments around the country to do exactly what you're doing here in Youngstown - to look for new and innovative ways to build the bonds in the community to advance public safety. But I want to say - beyond this gathering of courageous law enforcement officers, I want to say to all the citizens of Youngstown and people across the country that as we look for ways to improve public safety, we're not going to stop there. I mean, I couldn't be more proud to be part of an administration that, before this coronavirus pandemic struck, we had achieved the lowest unemployment level ever recorded for African Americans in the United States. We signed into law the highest funding ever for historically black colleges and universities. Working with Senator Tim Scott, we've created thousands of Opportunity Zones that would create investment and jobs in many of our inner-city communities that have been left behind for too long when it came to economic growth. And we've been championing educational choice. We think every parent ought to be able to choose where their children go to school, regardless of their income or their area code. So, educational opportunities, from K through 12 to higher education; more jobs and opportunities; and better public safety - that's what the American people want, that's what law enforcement wants, that's what our African American community wants, and that's what we're going to do in Youngstown, in Ohio, and all across America. So, let me just say again to Youngstown Police Chief Robin Lees, to Captain Mercer, and to each and every one of you: Thank you for your service. Thank you for your example. Thank you for stepping forward in a challenging time in the life of our nation and doing your jobs with integrity and selflessness. And just know, as you do your jobs every single day, you have the support of the American people and their admiration. And I am confident that you have the prayers of tens of millions of people across Ohio and across this country. Because we see among you men and women who - as I said before and I'll say one more time - who've stepped forward; who've answered a call to serve; who've been willing to, as the Old Book says, to bear the sword, to uphold law and order. And I want to promise you, on behalf of your President and all those millions of Americans: We will continue to stand with the men and women of law enforcement. We will continue to look for ways to improve what you do every day and to improve the lives of our African American citizens and every American. So help us God. Thank you very much. And God bless you. 	Thank you so much. Thank you for the - thank you for the warm welcome.

And what a beautiful vehicle to do it in the secretary of energy Danbury yet doing an incredible job for the United States of America would you give our secretary a big round blog of these. Folks Exactly. The mayor our no Hill thank you for your warm welcome for your great local leadership legendary coach Jim Tressel and above all my seat may still. Burns and the men and women often Lordstown Motors. What a great day in the Buckeye State. Really it is an honor to be here to be able to drive up and help unveil will soon be the 1st fully electric pickup truck on the market in the United States of America ladies and gentlemen I give you the Lordstown in durance a hit. And I gotta tell you it's a nice ride. And I'm a truck guy. I'm currently between trucks right now but I'm looking so but this is this is just a great day it's an exciting. Time not too long ago we had heart breaking news today is a new beginning for Lord's and it's a new day of leadership in electric vehicles in the United States. Really is going to be with all of you and on my way here today I got oh I got a phone call as soon as I landed from a friend of mine. Heard I was headed to Ohio. I think he sounded just a little bit jealous he's a man who loves the state of Ohio and he has been the best friend that automotive manufacturing has ever had in the Oval Office I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States President Donald Trump a hit. We just love them all and value May 1 of the very 1st campaign stops I made was at the Canfield fair in 2060 not too far from here we had just a few people came out. That would be tens of thousands of people that came out is probably the best attended county fair ever attended in my life but I saw the enthusiasm then I knew the people I knew the people all across the valley knew that that in that candidate a man who would become president of the United States you'd have someone who would fight for jobs and fight for American workers and today is one more example of President Trump's commitment to make American manufacturing great again. I want to thank all the distinguished guests who are here with us today you know the. Working with Senator Rob Portman working with your great governor Governor Mike De Wine and others this president went to work. Right after the people of Ohio said yes 3 and a half years ago we cut taxes across the board for working families and for small businesses we were roll back more federal red tape than any administration in American history we unleashed American energy and the kind of energy innovation that you're going to see in the valley now for decades to come we fought for free and fair trade in the values and ideals that have always made this country great and on every single promise President Trump delivered for the people of Ohio and the people. And you know that's especially true when it comes to automotive jobs into manufacturing for the 1st year of our biggest ration the president said he was going to put free and fair trade trade deals that put American jobs in American workers 1st back at the center of American policy we put China on notice that the era of air. Anomic surrender is over we stood strong for American jobs and American workers against China and thanks to the president's leadership in just a few weeks it'll be official NAFTA is gone and the US MCMA will soon be the law of the land. And it puts American manufacturing American workers 1st we didn't if you didn't know it under the us in ca 75 percent of all automotive parts have to be made here in North America and 40 percent of automotive parts must be made by workers making an average hourly wage essentially the average hourly wage of the United States. That's how we're doing folks that's how we have taken the incentive that was in NAFTA to move jobs south of the border that's all gone we're going to keep automotive jobs growing right here in Ohio and right here across the United. And he think back on of the 1st 3 years of this ministration the results really speak for themselves you saw businesses large and small create more than 7000000 jobs including 500000 manufacturing jobs of which 48000 new automotive jobs were created in just 3 years it was a manufacturing renaissance that was underway and really what was most meaningful to the president to me was not just the jobs were being added but wages were rising in what was most exciting to us as wages were rising most rapidly for hard working blue collar Americans The Forgotten Man and Women of America were forgotten that no more. The American Dream was working working again for every American the president I couldn't be more proud that in our 1st 3 years we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans the American dream came roaring back under President Donald Trump it's true. Our economy was on an incredible roll the stock market setting records jobs being created wages rise. And then as we all know then came the worst pandemic in a 100 years to strike our country from overseas. But in the midst of that. As the head of the White House coronavirus task force I can. Every step of the way. President Trump exercise the kind of leadership that every American on decisive action be literally before the month of January was out he stood up a task force bringing a whole of government response prepared but even before the 1st coronavirus case was transmitted from one American to another this president suspended all travel from China into the United States of America he put the health of America 1st. And I can tell you firsthand I can tell you firsthand the president's decisive action decisive action on that January day bought us invaluable time to stand up a national response and in that time from here in Ohio and all across the country you saw on the American people produced and delivered hundreds of millions of medical supplies to our incredible health care workers in all 50 states in fact. Can we just hear it for our doctors and our nurses and all of the incredible health care. That are right up to this moment. With those struggling. Rabbit. And we reinvented testing literally from a standing start you know when I was tapped to lead the coronavirus task force in late February we were using the old system of testing where you send samples to a state lab or you send them to the c.d.c. when we don't we done a few 1000 tests by the end of February but because the president brought together massive commercial labs in this country challenge them to step forward and meet this moment we're actually testing more than 500000 Americans every single day in we'll soon have tested 30000000 Americans all across this country we met the moment we met the moment with American innovation. And I have to tell you American manufacturing stepped up in so many ways to meet that moment for those critical medical supplies that maybe none more important with the way that we saw many of our greatest manufacturing companies step forward partner with the federal government to produce ventilators in an unprecedented rate. You know what we've heard from some countries overseas early on was that many people were succumbing to the corona virus because they didn't have the equipment like ventilators to see them through the worst of the disease. Oh we're going to make sure that didn't happen in America and I couldn't be more proud to tell you that thanks to the president's leadership thanks to the way American manufacturing stepped up no American who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States that's a national. You know and we met this moment we met this moment I believe with compassion and ingenuity we saw we saw the people across Ohio across America with the health of their family and their neighbors 1st in those 45 days to slow the spread of the people of Ohio with continued practice good common sense and good hygiene progress. And because of the foundation that we laid in this economy in those 1st 3 years I'm proud to report to you as we stand here today including Ohio all 50 states have started to open up our economies again. And while you see in the news over the past week or so we have rising cases in outbreaks in several southern states I want to assure you. Our task force and our entire ministration is working continuously with leaders in the States to respond I'll be traveling to Texas in Arizona in just a few days to meet with the governors and health officials there but I want you to know that it's a testament to testament to the resilience of the American people that like here in Ohio and beyond in some 38 states across the country cases are stable or even declining and I want to say the people of Ohio and your governor Mike De Wine have set a standard for the nation thank you for leading. With Well they're all the American people do and we're putting America back to work today is one more example of a great American comeback the truth is because of the foundation that we laid in this economy together over the 1st 3 years even as we begin to open up America in the month of May we actually saw the largest one month increase in jobs in American history 3000000 jobs created and that was before more than half of small businesses were even open yet and a lot of economists actually predicted that we would lose $8000000.00 jobs that month the unemployment rate might hit 20 percent but if you didn't hear about it not only do we create $3000000.00 jobs last month but but the unemployment rate didn't go up to 20 percent it actually dropped down from 14 percent to 13 percent and we're continuing to see unemployment claims claims steadily decline across the country America is coming back. And we also know the American consumers out there rolling again this economy going retail sales soared just a few days ago by 17.7 percent that was also the largest monthly increase in sales in history so the recovery is on. Which makes it even more time and more appropriate to be here at Lordstown Motors a part of the great American comeback. All of you gathered here today and all of you with great family histories in this community know that. This community is a perfect example of the character and resilience in the face of driving an American comeback after all we've been through I mean when you think about the storied history of this community and even this facility in durance isn't just the name of the pickup truck in durance describes the character of the people Mohan and Van Valley give yourselves a round. In the Mahoning Valley for more than 50 years this is story building was used to literally manufacture millions of cars that were sold and driven all over the world told they made the 66 Impala the cavalier in the cruise right here and when this facility closed in March of 2090. It was heartbreaking for this community. That's why as you all know President Donald Trump sprung into action he reached out to General Motors see if they could find a way to help bring jobs back to Lordstown he reached out to business leaders he reached out to your governor Mike De Wine to Senator Rob Portman to your members of Congress and on May. President was delighted to get the call he called it great news for Ohio when Steve Byrnes bought this building and set into motion the plans to create more town Motors Thank you. Her. Here one more time for Steve Burns thanks for stepping up. Starting a new chapter of history here in North. And they were walking me through this place and it seems just incredibly impressive many of us history working here see the incredible assets but they're retooling of the retooling this is storage facility a met with a lot of the engineers that designed this vehicle and I met with the team that's retooling this to manufacture these electric pickup trucks and soon you're going to continue that honing Valley tradition of world class auto manufacturers American workers are going to turn to American steel with American trucks made right here in March you know back when I was governess native Indian I used to say out here in the heartland we do 2 things well we make things and we grow things. And thanks to the resilience of this community thanks to the innovation represented here today. Once again Lordstown is going to be back big time in the make things business and you're going to make history right here and more sound mothers and. The truth is you all know with the president and I know is that manufacturing workers are the backbone of America's economy and here in the valley you have some very best in the world. On the way here I was reading about a few of them. Like a man who spent more than 30 years in the auto industry after he spent 14 years in the United States Navy as an electronics technician he was 8 years on a nuclear submarine and today he's going to be the director of central maintenance here at Lordstown motors would you join me in thanking him for his service to America and his leadership in this company John Ritter thank you so much. Thanks for your service Jim truly great as you know my own worthy son in law is a tenant in the United States Navy so. We're proud very before you are also heard of all a man I met just moments ago came to this country as a refugee after he heard a speech by my 2nd favorite President Ronald Reagan. He spent more than 20 years in the auto industries and worked his way up to the top management positions in 3 major companies he truly loves this country he's lived the American dream so would you join me in congratulating John Vo for his great great leadership and. George thank you. Thank you. And I mention John Ritter and John Boehner because they're really emblematic of all of you all of you in this community and all of you who are involved with Lordstown Motors today and will be involved in the years. The truth is you are leading a comeback here Northstowe you're leading it on the basis of. Character and resilience a reputation for professionalism. And you're leading in on the basis of faith in you all know the people of the heartland. For all that we've been through the best days for this community this state in this nation why. I want to thank you so much for your example in these challenging times and there is great opportunity ahead I actually learned this morning that g.m. and l.g. announced a new battery plant that's going to be built just across the street. And just a week later Steve announced that you'll be building your own batteries right here in this building so Lordstown Motors is just the start and it's going to continue to grow and expand jobs in this area and with the help help of. What you can applaud that I think that's really. With the help of a coach Jim Tressel I know you're working with Youngstown State to provide on the job training for talented engineers and technicians up tomorrow and we hear it for coach Jim Tressel that very. Thankful. And there's a great promise willing I want truck here on the stage with Steve actually told me that they've already pre-sold $14000.00 additions of the Lordstown endured struck it's ready to be made here and shipped out of here want to great stress. They've got a great team here doing the retooling doing the engineering but I know in the months ahead they're going to be ramping up production Steve was telling me by about this time next year they plan to hire 567800 people in this community and turn this factory all the way back home. It really is going to be a transition to great spec here in Lordstown after heartbreaking day in 2019. To see this kind of a comeback and I hope you see it's a. Testament to the confidence of the people of this company having the people of this community it's tribute to state leadership to a governor and to state officials that we're not going to leave large town behind. It's a tribute to a president who was not shy. About letting his feelings be known about the future of wars. And I write. But ultimately it is a tribute it is a tribute to a half a century half a century of craftsmanship. A half a century of integrity a reputation that is now drawing the investment to this community not just this company but the other companies and investments that have evolved so in a very real sense in a very real sense to the people Lordstown this day at large now. Is your day and so I I thank you for letting me share with you the beginning of a new chapter in the storied history of this great community in the storage facility and I know that with your hard work in the days ahead with the support of your great governor Mike De Wine with people like Senator Rob Portman with leadership at your state house in support of President Donald Trump and with God's help. The best days for more town and Ohio and America. Are yet to come thank you very much. God bless.	That might be the 1st time I've ever driven up on stage. And what a beautiful vehicle to do it in the secretary of energy Danbury yet doing an incredible job for the United States of America would you give our secretary a big round blog of these. Folks Exactly. The mayor our no Hill thank you for your warm welcome for your great local leadership legendary coach Jim Tressel and above all my seat may still. Burns and the men and women often Lordstown Motors. What a great day in the Buckeye State. Really it is an honor to be here to be able to drive up and help unveil will soon be the 1st fully electric pickup truck on the market in the United States of America ladies and gentlemen I give you the Lordstown in durance a hit. And I gotta tell you it's a nice ride. And I'm a truck guy. I'm currently between trucks right now but I'm looking so but this is this is just a great day it's an exciting. Time not too long ago we had heart breaking news today is a new beginning for Lord's and it's a new day of leadership in electric vehicles in the United States. Really is going to be with all of you and on my way here today I got oh I got a phone call as soon as I landed from a friend of mine. Heard I was headed to Ohio. I think he sounded just a little bit jealous he's a man who loves the state of Ohio and he has been the best friend that automotive manufacturing has ever had in the Oval Office I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States President Donald Trump a hit. We just love them all and value May 1 of the very 1st campaign stops I made was at the Canfield fair in 2060 not too far from here we had just a few people came out. That would be tens of thousands of people that came out is probably the best attended county fair ever attended in my life but I saw the enthusiasm then I knew the people I knew the people all across the valley knew that that in that candidate a man who would become president of the United States you'd have someone who would fight for jobs and fight for American workers and today is one more example of President Trump's commitment to make American manufacturing great again. I want to thank all the distinguished guests who are here with us today you know the. Working with Senator Rob Portman working with your great governor Governor Mike De Wine and others this president went to work. Right after the people of Ohio said yes 3 and a half years ago we cut taxes across the board for working families and for small businesses we were roll back more federal red tape than any administration in American history we unleashed American energy and the kind of energy innovation that you're going to see in the valley now for decades to come we fought for free and fair trade in the values and ideals that have always made this country great and on every single promise President Trump delivered for the people of Ohio and the people. And you know that's especially true when it comes to automotive jobs into manufacturing for the 1st year of our biggest ration the president said he was going to put free and fair trade trade deals that put American jobs in American workers 1st back at the center of American policy we put China on notice that the era of air. Anomic surrender is over we stood strong for American jobs and American workers against China and thanks to the president's leadership in just a few weeks it'll be official NAFTA is gone and the US MCMA will soon be the law of the land. And it puts American manufacturing American workers 1st we didn't if you didn't know it under the us in ca 75 percent of all automotive parts have to be made here in North America and 40 percent of automotive parts must be made by workers making an average hourly wage essentially the average hourly wage of the United States. That's how we're doing folks that's how we have taken the incentive that was in NAFTA to move jobs south of the border that's all gone we're going to keep automotive jobs growing right here in Ohio and right here across the United. And he think back on of the 1st 3 years of this ministration the results really speak for themselves you saw businesses large and small create more than 7000000 jobs including 500000 manufacturing jobs of which 48000 new automotive jobs were created in just 3 years it was a manufacturing renaissance that was underway and really what was most meaningful to the president to me was not just the jobs were being added but wages were rising in what was most exciting to us as wages were rising most rapidly for hard working blue collar Americans The Forgotten Man and Women of America were forgotten that no more. The American Dream was working working again for every American the president I couldn't be more proud that in our 1st 3 years we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans the American dream came roaring back under President Donald Trump it's true. Our economy was on an incredible roll the stock market setting records jobs being created wages rise. And then as we all know then came the worst pandemic in a 100 years to strike our country from overseas. But in the midst of that. As the head of the White House coronavirus task force I can. Every step of the way. President Trump exercise the kind of leadership that every American on decisive action be literally before the month of January was out he stood up a task force bringing a whole of government response prepared but even before the 1st coronavirus case was transmitted from one American to another this president suspended all travel from China into the United States of America he put the health of America 1st. And I can tell you firsthand I can tell you firsthand the president's decisive action decisive action on that January day bought us invaluable time to stand up a national response and in that time from here in Ohio and all across the country you saw on the American people produced and delivered hundreds of millions of medical supplies to our incredible health care workers in all 50 states in fact. Can we just hear it for our doctors and our nurses and all of the incredible health care. That are right up to this moment. With those struggling. Rabbit. And we reinvented testing literally from a standing start you know when I was tapped to lead the coronavirus task force in late February we were using the old system of testing where you send samples to a state lab or you send them to the c.d.c. when we don't we done a few 1000 tests by the end of February but because the president brought together massive commercial labs in this country challenge them to step forward and meet this moment we're actually testing more than 500000 Americans every single day in we'll soon have tested 30000000 Americans all across this country we met the moment we met the moment with American innovation. And I have to tell you American manufacturing stepped up in so many ways to meet that moment for those critical medical supplies that maybe none more important with the way that we saw many of our greatest manufacturing companies step forward partner with the federal government to produce ventilators in an unprecedented rate. You know what we've heard from some countries overseas early on was that many people were succumbing to the corona virus because they didn't have the equipment like ventilators to see them through the worst of the disease. Oh we're going to make sure that didn't happen in America and I couldn't be more proud to tell you that thanks to the president's leadership thanks to the way American manufacturing stepped up no American who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States that's a national. You know and we met this moment we met this moment I believe with compassion and ingenuity we saw we saw the people across Ohio across America with the health of their family and their neighbors 1st in those 45 days to slow the spread of the people of Ohio with continued practice good common sense and good hygiene progress. And because of the foundation that we laid in this economy in those 1st 3 years I'm proud to report to you as we stand here today including Ohio all 50 states have started to open up our economies again. And while you see in the news over the past week or so we have rising cases in outbreaks in several southern states I want to assure you. Our task force and our entire ministration is working continuously with leaders in the States to respond I'll be traveling to Texas in Arizona in just a few days to meet with the governors and health officials there but I want you to know that it's a testament to testament to the resilience of the American people that like here in Ohio and beyond in some 38 states across the country cases are stable or even declining and I want to say the people of Ohio and your governor Mike De Wine have set a standard for the nation thank you for leading. With Well they're all the American people do and we're putting America back to work today is one more example of a great American comeback the truth is because of the foundation that we laid in this economy together over the 1st 3 years even as we begin to open up America in the month of May we actually saw the largest one month increase in jobs in American history 3000000 jobs created and that was before more than half of small businesses were even open yet and a lot of economists actually predicted that we would lose $8000000.00 jobs that month the unemployment rate might hit 20 percent but if you didn't hear about it not only do we create $3000000.00 jobs last month but but the unemployment rate didn't go up to 20 percent it actually dropped down from 14 percent to 13 percent and we're continuing to see unemployment claims claims steadily decline across the country America is coming back.

CSPANMP2862020135	Mike Pence	2020-06-28	Vice President Pence at Celebrate Freedom Rally in Dallas	Speech	"It's good to be back in church. (Applause.) Pastor Jeffress, thank you for that overly generous introduction. Thank you for your ministry. To Governor Abbott, Secretary Carson, Senator Cornyn, Attorney General Paxton, my fellow Americans: It is a special joy to be with you today to celebrate freedom on this Sunday in this special place. You know, the Bible tells us it was for freedom that Christ set us free. And I cannot think of a better place to celebrate freedom than here at First Baptist Dallas with all of you and with a man who just spoke, and who has become so precious to your President, to your Vice President, and to all who serve our nation in the White House. Would you join me in just showing your appreciation - (applause) - for Pastor Robert Jeffress for his voice - for his ministry, for his courage, and for his faith. (Applause.) Thank you. And speaking of friends of mine, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine. I heard he tweeted I was going to be here this morning. (Laughter and applause.) He has been a great champion of everything we will celebrate this morning. And he's been a great champion of people of faith and all the freedoms that we cherish. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. Just a few days ago, the President said these words. He said, ""We will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as Americans."" We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, is the true way of life. And the President concluded by saying, ""We live by the words of our national motto: In God we trust."" And so it can be said of First Baptist Dallas. Since 1890, when a small group of believers laid the cornerstone of this church, this congregation has understood that the foundation of America is freedom, and the foundation of freedom is faith. (Applause.) Which makes it altogether fitting that we gather in this place and that we will gather, in the days ahead, in houses of worship all across America to celebrate freedom. So how do we celebrate freedom? On the occasion of the approval of the Declaration of Independence, our first Vice President said that he was, quote, ""apt to believe that [the day would] be celebrated by succeeding generations as a great anniversary… commemorated as a day of deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to God… solemnized with pomp and parade, with games and sports and guns and bells and bonfires and illuminations from one end of the continent to the other."" And so it has - (laughter) - especially here in Texas. And even in these challenging times, Americans will find ways, in the days ahead, as we approach our Independence Day, to celebrate just as John Adams described. But those of us who cherish freedom know that we do well to celebrate freedom every day, and to remember, as President Reagan said, that ""Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it on to our children in the bloodstream. It's to be fought for, protected, and handed down to them to do the same."" And I'm proud to report to you, as your Vice President, that from the first days of this administration, that's exactly what President Donald Trump has been doing: protecting, defending, and celebrating freedom of every American of every race and creed and color. And to celebrate freedom means many things. To celebrate freedom means building an economy where every American of every walk of life can live the American Dream. And under this President, we've allowed Americans to keep more of what they earn. We've rolled back the heavy hand of federal red tape at a historic pace. We've unleashed the vast natural resources of this land. And with that renewed freedom, before the pandemic struck, American businesses, large and small, had created more than 7 million jobs in our first three years. As we work now to safely reopen this state and this nation to put Americans back to work and to worship, let me take this opportunity to commend Governor Greg Abbott for his courageous and compassionate leadership for the people of Texas during this challenging time. (Applause.) Thank you, Governor Abbott. Working with your governor, we will put the health of the people of the Lone Star State first. And every single day, we'll continue to reclaim our freedom and our way of life - as each day, we are one day closer to the day we put this pandemic in the past. And when we do, with this governor and this President, we'll bring Texas and America back bigger and better than ever before. And as we did this morning, to celebrate freedom also means standing up for and standing with those who defend our freedom at home and abroad. The Armed Forces of the United States are the greatest force for good the world has ever known. And under President Trump's leadership, I'm proud to report to you, after years of budget cutbacks that literally saw a - a significant portion of our Air Force aircraft on the ground being used as spare parts to keep other aircraft in the air, we've rebuilt our military. We've restored the arsenal of democracy. And as the proud father of a United States Marine and the father-in-law of a Navy pilot, I couldn't be more happy to report to you that we're finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the support they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe. (Applause.) That's how we celebrate freedom as we stand with those who defend our freedom. And to celebrate freedom also means standing with our allies, with freedom-loving people around the world. And under President Donald Trump, if the world knows nothing else, the world knows this: America stands with Israel. To celebrate freedom also means standing up for persecuted people of faith all over the world. And under this President, we've worked tirelessly to stand with persecuted communities, whether it be in the Nineveh Plain of northern Iraq, where we've invested millions to help rebuild Christian and Yazidi communities; or whether it be working, as our President has, to release Americans facing persecution and captivity in places like Egypt and Venezuela. And Pastor Andrew Brunson is home. I'll never forget the day we were on the tarmac when three men who had been held in captivity in North Korea arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. They came down the stairs, and with the Secretary of State at my side, they handed each one of us a three-by-five card that's now framed in my office. On one side was a word of thanks to us and to the President. And on the other side was a Bible verse, as they were praising the Lord for being freed from captivity. They were men of faith and they are free today. And to celebrate freedom also means honoring and respecting the incredible men and women who serve in law enforcement at every level, every day. The American people know most of those who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best people in this country. They walk out the door every morning; they risk their lives to protect us and our families. But we all know the tragic events of recent days. And let me say: There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd, and justice will be served. (Applause.) But there's also no excuse for the rioting, looting, and violence that ensued. (Applause.) Burning churches is not protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech. There will be no tolerance for vandalism or violence in the United States, and we will prosecute those who do it to the fullest extent of the law. (Applause.) That's how we defend freedom. Finally, celebrating freedom means standing up for the values and liberties that we hold dear. As Dr. Jeffress said, that includes appointing now 200 judges to our federal courts who will all uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, like the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And none of it would've been possible without the strong support of the two senators from Texas who have stood with this President every step of the way. We want to thank Senator Ted Cruz. And join me now in thanking Senator John Cornyn for his principled, conservative leadership for our judiciary and our nation. And with the steady counsel of Pastor Robert Jeffress, our President has also defended religious liberty from the first day of this administration. We restored enforcement of the nation's conscience laws. We ended enforcement of the Johnson Amendment so the freedom of speech does not end at the front door of houses of worship in America. (Applause.) And like no other President in American history, President Donald Trump has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. This President and our administration celebrate freedom every day by upholding the ideals on which this nation was founded and defending them in each and every action. And now we find ourselves in a challenging time in our nation's history. We've gone through one of the worst pandemics in the history of this country, an economic downturn none of us expected, and, for a time, we saw chaos engulf the streets of many of our major cities. We've seen statues of some of our nation's greatest heroes being torn down. And one can't help but wonder that ancient question - that if the foundations crumble, how can the righteous stand? And yet, in the midst of such trials, American Christians have hope. We remember the countless triumphs we've won, even in our darkest hours: victories against empires, against injustice, against diabolical tyrannies across the world. During these times, we do well to remember that the foundation of America is freedom, but the foundation of freedom is faith. Our first President, George Washington, said, ""Religion and morality are the essential pillars of civil society."" And in his farewell address, he warned: ""In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens…"" He added, ""Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in the exclusion of religious principle."" During the tumultuous days of the Revolution, John Adams wrote to a friend that, quote, ""It is religion and morality alone which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand."" And when he became President, he said,""Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other."" It is the faith of the American people that has sustained us through every dark hour of this nation's history. And it is the faith of the American people that will sustain us through these days. (Applause.) It's that faith that has seen us through even greater challenges, guiding us in our relentless drive for a more perfect union, for liberty and justice for all. As Abraham Lincoln said while visiting Independence Hall in Philadelphia in 1861, speaking of our founding, he said, quote, there was ""something in that Declaration giving liberty, not only to the people of this country, but hope to the world for all future time."" He added, ""It was that which gave promise that in due time the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance."" (Applause.) And it happened. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said of the same founding documents that they were a ""promissory note"" of America - the promise that was made that all are created equal and are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. And in the fires of a civil war, in the midst of civil rights movement, it was the faith of the American people that drove us toward a more perfect union, and the faith of the American people will continue to perfect our nation for generations to come. The foundation of America is freedom. The foundation of freedom is faith. And as President Lincoln reminded us in words that, perhaps providentially, have already been on the wall of this church this morning. In a Thanksgiving message, our 16th President said, ""It is the duty of nations as well as of men… to recognize the sublime truth, announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord."" So in these challenging times, let's - let's hold fast to freedom. But let's also hold fast to that faith. (Applause.) Let's take to heart the title of Pastor Jeffress's latest book, and let's start ""Praying for America"" again. We're told - we're told that ""the prayer the upright pleases Him"" and that prayer reaches heaven, His holy dwelling place. And in these times of great anxiety for many, the Bible tells us, ""Don't be anxious about anything, but in every form of prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God, with the promise that the peace of God that passes all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus."" As our nation faces these difficult days, I believe more than ever that we stand in the need of prayer. In coming here today, I - I thought I - I wanted to encourage you: As you celebrate freedom in this coming week, practice prayer in a renewed way. As we think about the challenges - the loss of more than 125,000 of our countrymen; when we think of the grief of those families; we think of those that are still struggling with this disease today; those who've endured economic hardship in the midst of the challenges we face - let's claim that ancient promise that if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, He'll do like he's always done through the long and storied history of this nation. He'll hear from heaven, and He'll heal this land. (Applause.) He will. He will. So thank you for letting me join you for this Celebrate Freedom Sunday here at First Baptist Dallas. I would have just come just to sit in the pew - (laughter) - because it has been good for my heart to worship with you all this morning. It's a greatest honor of my life to be your Vice President, and I thank you for myself and for my family.  I had a pastor tell me once that everybody is under-encouraged. You have encouraged your Vice President and, I know, all of those in our delegation who are with us today, and we thank you. And I leave here today that - God is at work. And I had occasion to be reminded that, even when it doesn't seem that way, God is still working a little bit earlier this week. You see, I received a letter from a pastor who leads a church not far from Jacksonville, Florida. He told me of a time that he and his new bride were attending Asbury Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky, in 1977. It was a place where they held, in the spring, every year, a Christian music festival. They'd present the gospel with preachers. They'd present what was then the early versions of contemporary Christian music - have young people attend from all over the Midwest. But he wrote to me that, in 1977, they had decided at the seminary to discontinue the event. But he and his new bride felt called to do the work. He wrote to me and said that, ""Several friends told us that it would be very hard on our new marriage, and that we shouldn't do it."" But he said, ""We answered the call. We gathered a few other seminarians to help us,"" and they worked a whole year to arrange the event in the spring in 1978. And then he said, then the night came - the culminating evening on Saturday night, where he and his new bride were walking through the camp area. It was raining, and they were disappointed. They thought it all had been for naught. And then he said, ""And that's because I didn't know that that night a future Vice President of the United States of America would be giving his life to Jesus Christ.""  He wrote to me, ""I cannot write this without tears,"" and I could not read it without tears. Because I remember that night: Sitting on a hillside, it was raining, and it was like I - I heard the words for the first time that God so loved the world that He sent His only begotten son, that whoever might believe in Him might not perish but have eternal life. Then I stood up, and I walked down that night - not out of a sense of intellectual assent, but because my heart was broken with gratitude for what had been done for me on the cross. I'm working on a letter to that pastor - (laughter) - which I will not be able to write without tears, and I'm simply going to say, to him and his wife, ""Now I know who else to thank for that night so many years ago."" Even when things don't seem like they're going the way we expected, they're going away He expected. And we can claim those other ancient words that have been over the fireplace in our home in Indiana, in the Governor's Residence, in the Vice President's Residence today. They read, ""For I know the plans I have for you - plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future."" And I believe with all my heart, on this Celebrate Freedom Sunday and every day, that if we will but hold fast to Him, we'll see our way through these challenging times, we will restore our nation's health, we will renew our freedom, and we will inspire people across this land with our witness of the love and compassion and strength that comes in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Thank you for letting me join you today. God bless you. And God bless America. "	It's good to be back in church. Pastor Jeffress, thank you for that overly generous introduction. Thank you for your ministry. To Governor Abbott, Secretary Carson, Senator Cornyn, Attorney General Paxton, my fellow Americans: It is a special joy to be with you today to celebrate freedom on this Sunday in this special place. You know, the Bible tells us it was for freedom that Christ set us free. And I cannot think of a better place to celebrate freedom than here at First Baptist Dallas with all of you and with a man who just spoke, and who has become so precious to your President, to your Vice President, and to all who serve our nation in the White House. Would you join me in just showing your appreciation - - for Pastor Robert Jeffress for his voice - for his ministry, for his courage, and for his faith. Thank you. And speaking of friends of mine, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine. I heard he tweeted I was going to be here this morning. He has been a great champion of everything we will celebrate this morning. And he's been a great champion of people of faith and all the freedoms that we cherish. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. Just a few days ago, the President said these words. He said, 'We will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as Americans.' We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, is the true way of life. And the President concluded by saying, 'We live by the words of our national motto: In God we trust.' And so it can be said of First Baptist Dallas. Since 1890, when a small group of believers laid the cornerstone of this church, this congregation has understood that the foundation of America is freedom, and the foundation of freedom is faith. Which makes it altogether fitting that we gather in this place and that we will gather, in the days ahead, in houses of worship all across America to celebrate freedom. So how do we celebrate freedom? On the occasion of the approval of the Declaration of Independence, our first Vice President said that he was, quote, 'apt to believe that be celebrated by succeeding generations as a great anniversary commemorated as a day of deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to God solemnized with pomp and parade, with games and sports and guns and bells and bonfires and illuminations from one end of the continent to the other.' And so it has - - especially here in Texas. And even in these challenging times, Americans will find ways, in the days ahead, as we approach our Independence Day, to celebrate just as John Adams described. But those of us who cherish freedom know that we do well to celebrate freedom every day, and to remember, as President Reagan said, that 'Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it on to our children in the bloodstream. It's to be fought for, protected, and handed down to them to do the same.' And I'm proud to report to you, as your Vice President, that from the first days of this administration, that's exactly what President Donald Trump has been doing: protecting, defending, and celebrating freedom of every American of every race and creed and color. And to celebrate freedom means many things. To celebrate freedom means building an economy where every American of every walk of life can live the American Dream. And under this President, we've allowed Americans to keep more of what they earn. We've rolled back the heavy hand of federal red tape at a historic pace. We've unleashed the vast natural resources of this land. And with that renewed freedom, before the pandemic struck, American businesses, large and small, had created more than 7 million jobs in our first three years. As we work now to safely reopen this state and this nation to put Americans back to work and to worship, let me take this opportunity to commend Governor Greg Abbott for his courageous and compassionate leadership for the people of Texas during this challenging time. Thank you, Governor Abbott. Working with your governor, we will put the health of the people of the Lone Star State first. And every single day, we'll continue to reclaim our freedom and our way of life - as each day, we are one day closer to the day we put this pandemic in the past. And when we do, with this governor and this President, we'll bring Texas and America back bigger and better than ever before. And as we did this morning, to celebrate freedom also means standing up for and standing with those who defend our freedom at home and abroad. The Armed Forces of the United States are the greatest force for good the world has ever known. And under President Trump's leadership, I'm proud to report to you, after years of budget cutbacks that literally saw a - a significant portion of our Air Force aircraft on the ground being used as spare parts to keep other aircraft in the air, we've rebuilt our military. We've restored the arsenal of democracy. And as the proud father of a United States Marine and the father-in-law of a Navy pilot, I couldn't be more happy to report to you that we're finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the support they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe. That's how we celebrate freedom as we stand with those who defend our freedom. And to celebrate freedom also means standing with our allies, with freedom-loving people around the world. And under President Donald Trump, if the world knows nothing else, the world knows this: America stands with Israel. To celebrate freedom also means standing up for persecuted people of faith all over the world. And under this President, we've worked tirelessly to stand with persecuted communities, whether it be in the Nineveh Plain of northern Iraq, where we've invested millions to help rebuild Christian and Yazidi communities; or whether it be working, as our President has, to release Americans facing persecution and captivity in places like Egypt and Venezuela. And Pastor Andrew Brunson is home. I'll never forget the day we were on the tarmac when three men who had been held in captivity in North Korea arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. They came down the stairs, and with the Secretary of State at my side, they handed each one of us a three-by-five card that's now framed in my office. On one side was a word of thanks to us and to the President. And on the other side was a Bible verse, as they were praising the Lord for being freed from captivity. They were men of faith and they are free today. And to celebrate freedom also means honoring and respecting the incredible men and women who serve in law enforcement at every level, every day. The American people know most of those who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best people in this country. They walk out the door every morning; they risk their lives to protect us and our families. But we all know the tragic events of recent days. And let me say: There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd, and justice will be served. But there's also no excuse for the rioting, looting, and violence that ensued. Burning churches is not protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech. There will be no tolerance for vandalism or violence in the United States, and we will prosecute those who do it to the fullest extent of the law. That's how we defend freedom. Finally, celebrating freedom means standing up for the values and liberties that we hold dear. As Dr. Jeffress said, that includes appointing now 200 judges to our federal courts who will all uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, like the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And none of it would've been possible without the strong support of the two senators from Texas who have stood with this President every step of the way. We want to thank Senator Ted Cruz. And join me now in thanking Senator John Cornyn for his principled, conservative leadership for our judiciary and our nation. And with the steady counsel of Pastor Robert Jeffress, our President has also defended religious liberty from the first day of this administration. We restored enforcement of the nation's conscience laws. We ended enforcement of the Johnson Amendment so the freedom of speech does not end at the front door of houses of worship in America. And like no other President in American history, President Donald Trump has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. This President and our administration celebrate freedom every day by upholding the ideals on which this nation was founded and defending them in each and every action. And now we find ourselves in a challenging time in our nation's history. We've gone through one of the worst pandemics in the history of this country, an economic downturn none of us expected, and, for a time, we saw chaos engulf the streets of many of our major cities. We've seen statues of some of our nation's greatest heroes being torn down. And one can't help but wonder that ancient question - that if the foundations crumble, how can the righteous stand? And yet, in the midst of such trials, American Christians have hope. We remember the countless triumphs we've won, even in our darkest hours: victories against empires, against injustice, against diabolical tyrannies across the world. During these times, we do well to remember that the foundation of America is freedom, but the foundation of freedom is faith. Our first President, George Washington, said, 'Religion and morality are the essential pillars of civil society.' And in his farewell address, he warned: 'In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens' He added, 'Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in the exclusion of religious principle.' During the tumultuous days of the Revolution, John Adams wrote to a friend that, quote, 'It is religion and morality alone which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand.' And when he became President, he said,'Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.' It is the faith of the American people that has sustained us through every dark hour of this nation's history. And it is the faith of the American people that will sustain us through these days. It's that faith that has seen us through even greater challenges, guiding us in our relentless drive for a more perfect union, for liberty and justice for all. As Abraham Lincoln said while visiting Independence Hall in Philadelphia in 1861, speaking of our founding, he said, quote, there was 'something in that Declaration giving liberty, not only to the people of this country, but hope to the world for all future time.' He added, 'It was that which gave promise that in due time the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance.' And it happened. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said of the same founding documents that they were a 'promissory note' of America - the promise that was made that all are created equal and are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. And in the fires of a civil war, in the midst of civil rights movement, it was the faith of the American people that drove us toward a more perfect union, and the faith of the American people will continue to perfect our nation for generations to come. The foundation of America is freedom. The foundation of freedom is faith. And as President Lincoln reminded us in words that, perhaps providentially, have already been on the wall of this church this morning. In a Thanksgiving message, our 16th President said, 'It is the duty of nations as well as of men to recognize the sublime truth, announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord.' So in these challenging times, let's - let's hold fast to freedom. But let's also hold fast to that faith. Let's take to heart the title of Pastor Jeffress's latest book, and let's start 'Praying for America' again. We're told - we're told that 'the prayer the upright pleases Him' and that prayer reaches heaven, His holy dwelling place. And in these times of great anxiety for many, the Bible tells us, 'Don't be anxious about anything, but in every form of prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God, with the promise that the peace of God that passes all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.' As our nation faces these difficult days, I believe more than ever that we stand in the need of prayer. In coming here today, I - I thought I - I wanted to encourage you: As you celebrate freedom in this coming week, practice prayer in a renewed way. As we think about the challenges - the loss of more than 125,000 of our countrymen; when we think of the grief of those families; we think of those that are still struggling with this disease today; those who've endured economic hardship in the midst of the challenges we face - let's claim that ancient promise that if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, He'll do like he's always done through the long and storied history of this nation.

CSPANMP972020144	Mike Pence	2020-07-09	Vice President Pence Remarks at Law Enforcement Rally	Speech	"Hello, Philadelphia! (Applause.) Thank you for that great warm welcome. Thank you all for coming out. It's a great honor to be with all of you in an important time in the life of our nation. To Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, to your national president Pat Yoes, president John McNesby, it is great to be back in the Keystone State, but is particularly great to be here with members of an organization that, for 105 years, has been the voice of our nation's law enforcement officers: the Fraternal Order of Police. This organization has been a voice for the men and women on the Thin Blue Line for more than a century. And I want to - I want to tell you, on behalf of your President and on behalf of the American people, we hear that voice loud and clear, and I am here to say: We back the blue. And speaking of which, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine who loves the Keystone State, and he's been standing with the men and women in law enforcement from the first day of administration. He stands for law and order, and the safety of every American regardless of race or creed or color. I bring gratitude and greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. You know, in a time when the radical left is trying to smear police officers, I want you to know: Your President knows, this Vice President knows, and I think the overwhelming majority of the American people know the men and women of law enforcement are the best people in America. I think the President spoke for most Americans when he said not long ago, and I quote, ""the vast majority of police officers are selfless and courageous public servants."" And so you are. He went on to say ""great men and women."" When others run away from danger, police run straight into harm's way, putting their lives at stake to protect someone who they don't know or never met. And nowhere has that been more true than in the last four months here in Philadelphia, across Pennsylvania, and across America. It's been our law enforcement officers, along with our heroic healthcare workers who have stepped into the gap and saved lives in the midst of this pandemic. (Applause.) And you have our thanks and our admiration for your selflessness and your service. All of you who wear the uniform and those of you who have worn the uniform in the past, you answered a call in your life. As the Good Book says, you knew every day you go out that you don't bear the sword in vain. The truth is, the day you decided to put on that uniform, you decided to count our lives as more important than your own. And for that, I promise you: We will always honor the service of the men and women of law enforcement, and we will always honor your dedicated families who support you as you serve. I'm proud to say my own family's been backing the blue for quite a while. My uncle was a police officer in Chicago for 25 years. And I'll never forget when we'd make the long drive up from a small town in southern Indiana, drive up to the big city of Chicago - when I'd see my uncle come out with his uniform on and his sidearm on, my brothers and I would just look up and marvel. He was one of the heroes of my youth. And, frankly, I need to tell all of you if you need to be reminded: You are all heroes every day. And that really is why President Trump and I and our entire administration back the blue. We stand with the men and women serving on the Thin Blue Line every day. You literally are what separates order from chaos. You make it possible for the greatest nation in the history of the world to thrive and to prosper every day and for every American to be able to live in peace and security. But we live in a time when the radical left is presenting the American people with one false choice after another. Like lately, we've been we've been hearing people say that we've got to choose between funding our police and funding our communities. At the urging of the radical left - you've seen it - some cities around the country are already starting to make that wrong choice. Minneapolis, it was just reported, has begun dismantling their police department. New York City's Mayor de Blasio has actually cut the NYPD's budget by about a billion dollars. And I heard that, just yesterday, Joe Biden said that well-armed police, in his words, ""become the enemy."" And he said that he would, quote, ""absolutely"" cut funding for law enforcement. So I want you to hear this directly from me. Under this President and this administration, we're not going to defund the police - not now, not ever. This President is backing the blue by making more resources available to law enforcement across the country. That's why that's a false choice. The American people understand we can support law enforcement and support our communities. And from day one, our administration has been working to do just that. We back the blue, I'm proud to report, by funding nearly 4,000 new police officer positions through the COPS program. And as the Deputy Attorney General just said, we back the blue by prosecuting violent crimes more than ever before, resulting in a historic decrease in crime to show for it. You've done the work on the Thin Blue Line, and we're putting them away. And, you know, the American people know, nobody hates bad cops more than good cops. And that's why this President has also backed the blue by signing an executive order that immediately provides law enforcement across the country with the resources that you need to improve training and accountability and to prevent bad cops from moving from one department to another. The truth is, we don't need to choose between supporting our police and supporting our communities. And we also don't need to choose between supporting our police and supporting African American families here in Philadelphia or anywhere in America. We can do both, we have done both, and we will keep doing both every day. Let me be clear - and I know I speak for every law enforcement officer in this room: There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis, and justice will be served. But there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting and protests that turned violent that followed. I actually heard we've seen, in recent days, support for convicted cop killers here in the Philadelphia area. Well, burning churches is not protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech. And we're going to continue to stand with the freedom of speech and the freedom to peaceably assemble of every American. But we will join with you to stand against the rioters and the looters and the anarchists who would pull down our statues and try and destroy our communities. We're going to support law enforcement as you keep the peace. And we're going to prosecute those who vandalize our cities to the fullest extent of the law.  The truth is, the American people know that public safety is vital. It's vital to the prosperity of our communities. It's vital to the health and wellbeing of our families. I mean, to back the blue is to back all Americans. And we also know that when communities are safe, they can thrive. And this administration has been committed to safe and thriving communities for all Americans, including our minority communities and our African American communities, and our record proves it. You know, prior to the outset of this pandemic, your President cut taxes, rolled back regulations, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade. We saw 7 million jobs created, and we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. This President already obtained the highest funding for historically black colleges and universities. We've created more than 8,000 Opportunity Zones to help encourage investment and economic growth in our inner-city communities. We've expanded healthcare options so our least fortunate citizens can access the healthcare they need. And in the midst of this coronavirus pandemic, we've surged testing and surged resources, recognizing the unique challenges that members of our minority community have faced in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. We also enacted criminal justice reform, provided thousands of our fellow citizens a second chance and a shot at redemption. And on behalf of all of the families, especially our minority families, we've stood strong for school choice. We stood for the principle that every parent ought to be able to choose where their children go to school regardless of their income or their area code. That's how we empower families. So we don't have to choose, men and women. We don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement, supporting our communities, or supporting every family of every background. And the truth is we're going to support our police. We're going to support public safety. And we're going to work every day to improve the lives and opportunities and education for every American. I mean, we cannot allow those who would foster an atmosphere of division or contempt for law enforcement to present themselves as friends of our inner-cities' communities. I mean, to truly love our communities and all the families that live, particularly in our major cities, we've got to love public safety, we've got to love law enforcement, and we got to love every family and fight every day to ensure that every American has a fair shot at living the American Dream. You know, the American people - the American people understand the risks that all of you take every day when you put on that uniform. I hear about it all the time as I travel across the country as your Vice President. You are deeply admired and deeply respected, and it's because of what we hear of the stories that you do. I mean, who could ever forget the North 15th Street shootout last year? Eight officers came under fire, wounded, trying to apprehend the suspect who barricaded himself inside a building. They saved multiple hostages in the process, while taking wounds themselves. And I must tell you, not just here in Philadelphia, but all over America, Joshua Burkitt, Ryan Waltman, Justin Matthews, Nate Harper, Shaun Parker, James Wheeler, Erick Wright, and Michael Guinter are heroes, and they're heroes to all of the American people. And they're with us today. Would you mind just showing how much we admire and appreciate all of these great law enforcement officers? It's an honor to be with them today.  I just had a chance to visit with some of those heroes, and we were talking about - talking about that day - their heroism and their selflessness. And we all agreed that it was God's grace and their guts that got them through that day. And it's among the stories that tell us why we - why we so admire - so admire all of you who wear the uniform. The other reason is because we also understand the dangers that you face every day. I said earlier that when you put on that uniform the first day, you decide to count our lives more important than yours. Like a police officer who began his career in his early 20s, serving with distinction for nearly 23 years in this department. And over 14 years ago - I just heard about it - he landed his dream job in the SWAT unit. And it was there, not long ago, that he paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect and serve the people of this community, serving an arrest warrant on a murder suspect. I had the great privilege just a few moments ago to meet his incredible wife, Terri, who's worked in public safety - his son, Jimmy; daughter-in-law, Nicole, who are both in law enforcement. And I said to them what I'll say to you: Pennsylvania and America will never forget or fail to honor the service and sacrifice of Corporal Jimmy O'Connor.  I told the family that one of my favorite verses is that ""the Lord is close to the brokenhearted,"" and that'll - that'll be all of our prayer for you. And we mourn with those who mourn and we grieve with those who grieve, but we do not grieve like those who have no hope, because we have our faith to give us hope, but heroes give us hope. It's my great honor to be with you today. It truly is. So we understand the sacrifices, the risks that all of you take. And it's why, despite the heated rhetoric of recent days, I just want to assure you that you are esteemed and loved all across this country. You are prayed for by people all across this country. I mean, the truth is, in these challenging times through which we've passed, there will always be more that unites us in these United States than could ever divide us. As President Trump said not long ago, we may all come from different places and different backgrounds, but we're all united by a desire to ensure peace and dignity and equality for all Americans. And you're the agents of all those ideals every day. And I just had to come by today to make sure that you knew that your President, this Vice President, and our administration, and people all across the country know that. We know that you're the best of us. We know that you've literally put your lives on the line every day because you love this community. You love all the families in this community. You bear the burden of our safety so that we can go about our lives. And the American people will always be grateful. You all prove the lengths to which law enforcement is willing to go to protect others. And on behalf of President Trump and our entire administration, I'll make you a promise: We will always have your back. To the men and women of law enforcement, the Fraternal Order of Police, it's my great honor to be with all of you today. It's humbling to stand in front of so many heroes and heroic families. And I just want you to know we love you. We support you. We pray for you. And millions of Americans pray for you every day, that as you protect and serve that no harm would befall you and you return home families each and every night. So let me just say to each and every one of you, on behalf of a grateful nation, and your President, and as Vice President, thank you for your service. We will always back the blue."	Hello, Philadelphia! Thank you for that great warm welcome. Thank you all for coming out. It's a great honor to be with all of you in an important time in the life of our nation. To Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, to your national president Pat Yoes, president John McNesby, it is great to be back in the Keystone State, but is particularly great to be here with members of an organization that, for 105 years, has been the voice of our nation's law enforcement officers: the Fraternal Order of Police. This organization has been a voice for the men and women on the Thin Blue Line for more than a century. And I want to - I want to tell you, on behalf of your President and on behalf of the American people, we hear that voice loud and clear, and I am here to say: We back the blue. And speaking of which, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine who loves the Keystone State, and he's been standing with the men and women in law enforcement from the first day of administration. He stands for law and order, and the safety of every American regardless of race or creed or color. I bring gratitude and greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. You know, in a time when the radical left is trying to smear police officers, I want you to know: Your President knows, this Vice President knows, and I think the overwhelming majority of the American people know the men and women of law enforcement are the best people in America. I think the President spoke for most Americans when he said not long ago, and I quote, 'the vast majority of police officers are selfless and courageous public servants.' And so you are. He went on to say 'great men and women.' When others run away from danger, police run straight into harm's way, putting their lives at stake to protect someone who they don't know or never met. And nowhere has that been more true than in the last four months here in Philadelphia, across Pennsylvania, and across America. It's been our law enforcement officers, along with our heroic healthcare workers who have stepped into the gap and saved lives in the midst of this pandemic. And you have our thanks and our admiration for your selflessness and your service. All of you who wear the uniform and those of you who have worn the uniform in the past, you answered a call in your life. As the Good Book says, you knew every day you go out that you don't bear the sword in vain. The truth is, the day you decided to put on that uniform, you decided to count our lives as more important than your own. And for that, I promise you: We will always honor the service of the men and women of law enforcement, and we will always honor your dedicated families who support you as you serve. I'm proud to say my own family's been backing the blue for quite a while. My uncle was a police officer in Chicago for 25 years. And I'll never forget when we'd make the long drive up from a small town in southern Indiana, drive up to the big city of Chicago - when I'd see my uncle come out with his uniform on and his sidearm on, my brothers and I would just look up and marvel. He was one of the heroes of my youth. And, frankly, I need to tell all of you if you need to be reminded: You are all heroes every day. And that really is why President Trump and I and our entire administration back the blue. We stand with the men and women serving on the Thin Blue Line every day. You literally are what separates order from chaos. You make it possible for the greatest nation in the history of the world to thrive and to prosper every day and for every American to be able to live in peace and security. But we live in a time when the radical left is presenting the American people with one false choice after another. Like lately, we've been we've been hearing people say that we've got to choose between funding our police and funding our communities. At the urging of the radical left - you've seen it - some cities around the country are already starting to make that wrong choice. Minneapolis, it was just reported, has begun dismantling their police department. New York City's Mayor de Blasio has actually cut the NYPD's budget by about a billion dollars. And I heard that, just yesterday, Joe Biden said that well-armed police, in his words, 'become the enemy.' And he said that he would, quote, 'absolutely' cut funding for law enforcement. So I want you to hear this directly from me. Under this President and this administration, we're not going to defund the police - not now, not ever. This President is backing the blue by making more resources available to law enforcement across the country. That's why that's a false choice. The American people understand we can support law enforcement and support our communities. And from day one, our administration has been working to do just that. We back the blue, I'm proud to report, by funding nearly 4,000 new police officer positions through the COPS program. And as the Deputy Attorney General just said, we back the blue by prosecuting violent crimes more than ever before, resulting in a historic decrease in crime to show for it. You've done the work on the Thin Blue Line, and we're putting them away. And, you know, the American people know, nobody hates bad cops more than good cops. And that's why this President has also backed the blue by signing an executive order that immediately provides law enforcement across the country with the resources that you need to improve training and accountability and to prevent bad cops from moving from one department to another. The truth is, we don't need to choose between supporting our police and supporting our communities. And we also don't need to choose between supporting our police and supporting African American families here in Philadelphia or anywhere in America. We can do both, we have done both, and we will keep doing both every day. Let me be clear - and I know I speak for every law enforcement officer in this room: There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis, and justice will be served. But there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting and protests that turned violent that followed. I actually heard we've seen, in recent days, support for convicted cop killers here in the Philadelphia area. Well, burning churches is not protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech. And we're going to continue to stand with the freedom of speech and the freedom to peaceably assemble of every American. But we will join with you to stand against the rioters and the looters and the anarchists who would pull down our statues and try and destroy our communities. We're going to support law enforcement as you keep the peace. And we're going to prosecute those who vandalize our cities to the fullest extent of the law. The truth is, the American people know that public safety is vital. It's vital to the prosperity of our communities. It's vital to the health and wellbeing of our families. I mean, to back the blue is to back all Americans. And we also know that when communities are safe, they can thrive. And this administration has been committed to safe and thriving communities for all Americans, including our minority communities and our African American communities, and our record proves it. You know, prior to the outset of this pandemic, your President cut taxes, rolled back regulations, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade. We saw 7 million jobs created, and we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. This President already obtained the highest funding for historically black colleges and universities. We've created more than 8,000 Opportunity Zones to help encourage investment and economic growth in our inner-city communities. We've expanded healthcare options so our least fortunate citizens can access the healthcare they need. And in the midst of this coronavirus pandemic, we've surged testing and surged resources, recognizing the unique challenges that members of our minority community have faced in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. We also enacted criminal justice reform, provided thousands of our fellow citizens a second chance and a shot at redemption. And on behalf of all of the families, especially our minority families, we've stood strong for school choice. We stood for the principle that every parent ought to be able to choose where their children go to school regardless of their income or their area code. That's how we empower families. So we don't have to choose, men and women. We don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement, supporting our communities, or supporting every family of every background. And the truth is we're going to support our police. We're going to support public safety. And we're going to work every day to improve the lives and opportunities and education for every American. I mean, we cannot allow those who would foster an atmosphere of division or contempt for law enforcement to present themselves as friends of our inner-cities' communities. I mean, to truly love our communities and all the families that live, particularly in our major cities, we've got to love public safety, we've got to love law enforcement, and we got to love every family and fight every day to ensure that every American has a fair shot at living the American Dream. You know, the American people - the American people understand the risks that all of you take every day when you put on that uniform. I hear about it all the time as I travel across the country as your Vice President. You are deeply admired and deeply respected, and it's because of what we hear of the stories that you do. I mean, who could ever forget the North 15th Street shootout last year? Eight officers came under fire, wounded, trying to apprehend the suspect who barricaded himself inside a building. They saved multiple hostages in the process, while taking wounds themselves. And I must tell you, not just here in Philadelphia, but all over America, Joshua Burkitt, Ryan Waltman, Justin Matthews, Nate Harper, Shaun Parker, James Wheeler, Erick Wright, and Michael Guinter are heroes, and they're heroes to all of the American people. And they're with us today. Would you mind just showing how much we admire and appreciate all of these great law enforcement officers? It's an honor to be with them today. I just had a chance to visit with some of those heroes, and we were talking about - talking about that day - their heroism and their selflessness. And we all agreed that it was God's grace and their guts that got them through that day. And it's among the stories that tell us why we - why we so admire - so admire all of you who wear the uniform. The other reason is because we also understand the dangers that you face every day. I said earlier that when you put on that uniform the first day, you decide to count our lives more important than yours. Like a police officer who began his career in his early 20s, serving with distinction for nearly 23 years in this department. And over 14 years ago - I just heard about it - he landed his dream job in the SWAT unit. And it was there, not long ago, that he paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect and serve the people of this community, serving an arrest warrant on a murder suspect. I had the great privilege just a few moments ago to meet his incredible wife, Terri, who's worked in public safety - his son, Jimmy; daughter-in-law, Nicole, who are both in law enforcement. And I said to them what I'll say to you: Pennsylvania and America will never forget or fail to honor the service and sacrifice of Corporal Jimmy O'Connor. I told the family that one of my favorite verses is that 'the Lord is close to the brokenhearted,' and that'll - that'll be all of our prayer for you. And we mourn with those who mourn and we grieve with those who grieve, but we do not grieve like those who have no hope, because we have our faith to give us hope, but heroes give us hope. It's my great honor to be with you today. It truly is. So we understand the sacrifices, the risks that all of you take. And it's why, despite the heated rhetoric of recent days, I just want to assure you that you are esteemed and loved all across this country. You are prayed for by people all across this country. I mean, the truth is, in these challenging times through which we've passed, there will always be more that unites us in these United States than could ever divide us.

And you're the agents of all those ideals every day.

We have more resources today to deal with this pandemic than ever before. Will be briefing the governor today will be traveling to LSU later today to talk about increasing testing. In fact, we have a new surge site in in baton rouge among surge sites in testing that are being implemented around the country. PPE has been made available in the hundreds of millions of supplies, therapeutics like Remdesivir continue to be distributed to states including Louisiana and I'm proud to report that we're moving forward aggressively at warp speed on the development of a vaccine. But each and every one of you have been the hands and feet of Louisiana's response and on behalf of your president, on behalf of the entire White House coronavirus task force, I just came by to say thank you, thank you for the long hours that you put in.

And I'd like to invite them to bring a few remarks.	Well, thank you Governor Edwards. Good to be in Louisiana.

THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO TOUTED THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMIC SHUTDOWN IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MIKE PENCE! [APPLAUSE] (music) VICE PRES. PENCE: HELLO, WISCONSIN. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR THAT WARM WELCOME. TO CONGRESS MINGLING GROSSMAN, CONGRESSMAN BRIAN STILES, STATE SENATORS, MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE, HONORED GUESTS AND MY FELLOW AMERICANS, IT IS GOOD TO BE HERE IN RIPON, WISCONSIN, THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. [APPLAUSE] AND IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE BADGER STATE WITH SO MANY GREAT AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] AND THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY. ALLOW ME TO BEGIN BY BRINGING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER GREAT FAN OF THE BADGER STATE, A MAN WHO LOVES THE STATE OF WISCONSIN AND HAS BEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS AND WAS IN THIS STATE NOT LONG AGO. ALLOW ME TO BRING GREETINGS FROM THE 45TH AS AN OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. , PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS, PRESIDENT TRUMP DID KEEP EVERY PROMISE HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE RESULTS WERE EXTRAORDINARY. WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY, CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD, ROLLED BACK REGULATIONS AT A RECORD PACE, UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY, FOUGHT FOR FREE AND THEIR TRADE, AND IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS ALONE, BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED MORE THAN 7 MILLION NEW JOBS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] WAGES ROSE AT THE FASTEST PACE IN MORE THAN 10 YEARS. 10 MILLION AMERICANS WERE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY AND 7 MILLION AMERICANS WERE LIFTED OUT OF FOOD STAMPS. BEYOND THAT, WE REACHED THE HIGHEST MEDIAN INCOME IN THE HISTORY OF UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY THREE YEARS OF PROGRESS AND RENEWAL, BUILDING OUR MILITARY, REVIVING OUR ECONOMY. BUT THEN THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC STRUCK OUR NATION. PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK UNPRECEDENTED ACTION. HE PUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF AMERICA FIRST FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS. BEFORE THE MONTH OF JANUARY WAS OVER, HE SUSPENDED TRAVEL FROM CHINA AND STOOD UP THE WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWS, WE HAVE DEVELOPED NOT ONLY A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT WHICH BUT A WHOLE OF AMERICA APPROACH. WE HAVE MARSHALED THE FULL RESOURCES OF AMERICA TO SAVE LIVES AND PROTECT THE VULNERABLE AND SUPPORT OF THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF DOCTORS AND NURSES US THE COUNTRY. I WILL MAKE YOU A PROMISE , AS WE CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, WILL , WE WILL WORK 24 HOURS A DAY TO ENSURE THAT ALL STATES IMPACTED, ALL HOSPITALS AND GREAT HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE THE SUPPLIES AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO GIVE EVERY AMERICAN THE SAME LEVEL OF CARE THAT WE WOULD WANT A MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY TO HAVE. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE MEETING THIS MOMENT WITH AMERICAN COMPASSION AND AMERICAN RESOLVE. WE ARE ALSO OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN. IT IS EXTRAORDINARY TO THINK THAT AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, OUR ECONOMY LOST 22 MILLION JOBS. BECAUSE OF THE STRONG FOUNDATION PRESIDENT TRUMP LAID OF LESS TAXES AND LESS REGULATION, INTO SHORT MONTHS, MAY AND JUNE, SAW RECORD-BREAKING JOB CREATION. WE HAVE ADDED 7 MILLION JOBS ACT TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. [APPLAUSE] WE ALL KNOW, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, THAT WE ARE PASSING THROUGH A TIME OF TESTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SOON WE WILL COME TO A TIME FOR CHOOSING, WHICH IS WHAT BRINGS ME HERE TODAY. IN 110 DAYS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE. THE CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER AND THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. I CAME HERE TO THE CITY OF RIPON , WISCONSIN CAMERA WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY , WISCONSIN, WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS BORN, TO DESCRIBE THAT CHOICE. IN 1854, THEY WROTE THAT THE DECISION TO FOUND A NEW POLITICAL PARTY HAD BEEN ""FORCED UPON US BY THE SLAVE POWER AND IN THE DEFENSE OF FREEDOM."" THEY SAID THEY WOULD COOPERATE AND BE KNOWN AS REPUBLICANS, AND SO THEY HAVE EVER BEEN. [APPLAUSE] SEARS LATER, THEY ELECTED THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, , SIX YEARS LATER, THEY ELECTED THE FIRST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, WHO USHERED IN THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF OUR HIGHEST IDEALS. FOUR MONTHS FROM NOW, I KNOW OUR PARTY WILL REELECT ANOTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHEN WE REELECT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] IT IS WHY I AM HERE TODAY, TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE AND TO TALK ABOUT THE CHOICE OUR NATION FACES. OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS ON THE BALLOT, BUT SO ARE THINGS FAR MORE FUNDAMENTAL AND FOUNDATIONAL TO OUR COUNTRY. IT'S NOT SO MUCH WHETHER AMERICA WILL BE MORE CONSERVATIVE MORE LIBERAL, MORE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, MORE RED OR BLUE. IT IS WHETHER AMERICA REMAINS AMERICA. WHETHER WE WILL LEAVE TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN A COUNTRY GROUNDED IN OUR HIGHEST IDEALS OF FREEDOM, FREE MARKET, THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS TO LIFE AND LIBERTY, OR WHETHER WE WILL LEAVE TO THEM A COUNTRY THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING ELSE. LIKE THOSE FIRST REPUBLICANS, WE STAND AT A CROSSROADS OF FREEDOM. BEFORE US ARE TEWOWO PATHS, ONE BASED ON THE DIGNITY OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL, AND THE OTHER ON THE GROWING CONTROL OF THE STATE. OUR ROAD LEADS TO GREATER FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY. THERE ROAD LEADS TO SOCIALISM , THEIR ROAD LISA SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. PRESIDENT TRUMP SET US ON A PATH OF FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN WOULD SET AMERICA ON THE PATH OF SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. AMERICA IS A BLESSED AND EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY, UNIQUE AMONG THE NATIONS. WE HAVE BEEN AN ASYLUM OF HOPE FOR MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE, AS THE WORDS ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY DECLARE. MANY OF OUR GREATEST CITIZENS HAVE COME FROM CORNERS OF THE RULED , OF THE WORLD RULED BY SOCIALIST REGIMES. IF YOU EVER DOUBT WHETHER THIS COUNTRY IS SPECIAL AND UNIQUE, JUST TALK TO ONE OF THEM. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, PRESIDENT TRUMP SET OUR NATION ON THAT PATH READ HIM AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY AMERICAN REGARDLESS OF RACE, CREED OR COLOR. AMERICA'S FAMILIES ENJOYED RECORD LOW CRIME RATES, RECORD HIGH PROSPERITY, THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF A GOVERNMENT DEVOTED TO LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT NOW ALL OF THAT IS UNDER THREAT. JOE BIDEN HAS REFERRED TO HIMSELF AS A TRANSITION CANDIDATE. BUT MANY WERE ASKING ACROSS THIS COUNTRY , A TRANSITION TO WHAT? NOW WE HAVE THE ANSWER. RECENTLY, JOE BIDEN COMBINED FORCES WITH THE SOCIALIST BERNIE SANDERS AND THE RADICAL LEFT WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE DON'T NEED TO GUESS WHERE THEY ARE PLANNING TO TAKE AMERICA. BIDEN AND SANDERS RECENTLY RELEASED A DOCUMENT FROM THEIR UNITY TASK FORCE OUTLINING THEIR AGENDA FOR THE COUNTRY. READING THAT DOCUMENT, I THOUGHT JOE BIDEN WON THE DEMOCRAT PRIMARY, BUT LOOKING AT THE DOCUMENT, IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE BERNIE WON. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AGENDA, THE ONLY THING IT IS UNIFYING IS JOE BIDEN TO THE RADICAL LEFT. CONTRARY TO THEIR RADICAL AGENDA, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS REBUILDING THE ECONOMY BASED ON FREEDOM AND FREE MARKETS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DID IT ONCE BEFORE AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WILL DO IT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] AT THE ROOT OF THE BIDEN-SANDERS AGENDA IS A BELIEF THAT AMERICA IS DRIVEN BY IN THE, NOT ASPIRATION. THAT , BY ENVY, NOT ASPIRATION. THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HARBOR ILL WILL TOWARD THEIR NEIGHBORS. THE RADICAL LEFT BELIEVES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST BE INVOLVED IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES TO CORRECT THOSE AMERICAN WRONGS. THEY BELIEVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO DICTATE HOW AMERICANS LIVE, HOW WE SHOULD WORK, HOW WE SHOULD RAISE OUR CHILDREN, AND IN THE PROCESS THE PRIVATE OUR PEOPLE OF FREEDOM , DEPRIVE OUR PEOPLE OF FREEDOM, PROSPERITY AND SECURITY. THEIR AGENDA IS BASED ON GOVERNMENT CONTROL. OUR AGENDA IS BASED ON FREEDOM. [APPLAUSE] JUST LOOK AT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN OUR RECORD AND THE BIDEN AGENDA. PRESIDENT TRUMP CUT TAXES BY $5.5 TRILLION, THE LARGEST TAX CUT AND REFORM IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN PLANS TO INCREASE TAXES BY NEARLY $4 TRILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE ALONE. TWICE AS MUCH AS HILLARY CLINTON EVER PROPOSED. PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT ONLY CUT TAXES, BUT WE HAVE ROLLED BACK FEDERAL RED TAPE AT A HISTORIC CASE , PACE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS REPEALED MORE FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAN IN THE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY, ENABLING ECONOMY TO ADD A MILLION JOBS IN THE LAST TWO MONTH ALONE. , 8 MILLION JOBS IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS ALONE. JOE BIDEN WOULD PROPOSE AN AVALANCHE OF REGULATIONS ON OUR ECONOMY, STIFLING THE ECONOMY AND COSTING AMERICAN JOBS. WHEN IT COMES TO AMERICAN JOBS, IT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO SAID THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER IS OVER, AND HE STOOD UP TO CHINA. [APPLAUSE] HE FOUGHT FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE. JUST THE OTHER DAY, HE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER HOLDING CHINA ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS TREATMENT OF HONG KONG, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO STAND STRONG. JOE BIDEN PRETENDS TO BE TOUGH ON CHINA BUT THE REALITY IS THAT NO BIDEN HAS HELPED CHINA ALL ALONG THE WAY, ATTAINING MOST FAVORED NATION STATUS IN THE WTO. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID NOTHING WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS VICE PRESIDENT TO PREVENT THE OUTSOURCING OF MILLIONS OF JOBS IN MANUFACTURING TO THAT COMMUNIST NATION. AND RESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS STOOD FOR OUR HIGHEST IDEALS AT HOME AND ABROAD. IT WAS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHO WITHDREW AMERICA FROM THE JOB KILLING PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD AND SAVED THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN JOBS. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN WANTS TO JOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD AGAIN, PLACING A CRUSHING WEIGHT ON AMERICAN BUSINESS AND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE U.S. HAS ACHIEVED ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NO LONGER RELYING ON THE MIDDLE EAST FOR OIL, AND NOW AMERICA IS A NET EXPORTER OF ENERGY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 75 YEARS. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN WOULD DESTROY OUR FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY, RETURN TO THE WAR ON COAL, PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICA'S IMMENSE ENERGY RESERVES AND POSE A REGIME OF CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS ON LITERALLY EVERY NEW BUILDING ON THE UNITED , IN THE UNITED STATES, EVERY HOME, EVERY BUSINESS, THAT WOULD DRASTICALLY INCREASE THE COST OF LIVING FOR FAMILIES AND THE COST OF BUSINESSES, AT THE COST OF JOBS. WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACHIEVED A HISTORIC DECLINE IN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, JOE BIDEN SUPPORTS GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD SET US ON AN INEXORABLE PATH TO SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES IN A STRONG BORDER FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AS OUR PRESIDENT HAS SAID MANY TIMES, DON'T HAVE ORDERS, YOU DON'T HAVE A NATION. AS WE STAND HERE TODAY, I AM PROUD TO REPORT WE HAVE ALREADY BUILT 200 MILES OF THAT BORDER WALL ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE COURAGEOUS MEN AND WOMEN OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AND ICE EVERY DAY. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN IS FOR OPEN BORDERS. THEIR AGENDA CALLS FOR AN END TO DEPORTATIONS, SUPPORT FOR SANCTUARY CITIES, THREE LAWYERS AND FREE HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, ALL PAID FOR BY AMERICAN TAXPAYERS. IT IS EXTRAORDINARY. AND CLOSER TO HOME, THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR ALLOWING EVERY PARENT TO CHOOSE WHERE THEIR CHILDREN GOES TO SCHOOL REGARDLESS OF INCOME OR AREA CODE. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP STANDS FOR SCHOOL CHOICE. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IN WISCONSIN, THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE SCHOOL CHOICE MOVEMENT IN AMERICA, YOU DESERVE TO KNOW. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN WOULD TAKE AWAY THE RIGHT OF PARENTS TO CHOOSE WHERE THEIR CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL , PUBLIC, PRIVATE OR PAROCHIAL. YOU NEED TO TELL YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS. JOE BIDEN WANTS TO END SCHOOL CHOICE. THOSE ARE THE FACTS. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT OUR ECONOMY AND DEFENDING AMERICAN JOBS AND HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. I CANNOT BE MORE PROUD TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO A PRESIDENT WHO HAS STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. [APPLAUSE] BY CONTRAST, JOE BIDEN SUPPORTS TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION. REPEALING THE HYDE AMENDMENT, ENDING A POLICY THAT SUPPORTS ABORTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. HE EVEN SUPPORTS LATE-TERM ABORTION, ALLOWING INNOCENT, UNBORN CHILDREN TO BE ABORTED UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. SO IT IS ABOUT OUR ECONOMY, IT IS ABOUT OUR WELL-BEING, IT IS ABOUT OUR VALUES. BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION AT HOME. LET ME SAY, DON'T EVER DOUBT , PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND THIS ADMINISTRATION STAND WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. [APPLAUSE] THE PRESIDENT AND I KNOW THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT ON THE UNIFORM OF LAW-ENFORCEMENT EVERYDAY ARE THE BEST OF US. THEY RISK THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY. THEY CONSIDER OUR LIVES MORE ORGANS THAN THEIR OWN , OUR LIVES MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEIR OWN AND THEY HAVE OUR SUPPORT. IT IS A FALSE CHOICE TO THINK WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS. UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WE WILL SO LAW ENFORCEMENT, IMPROVE THE LOOK SAFETY, AND STAND WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES AND ALL MINORITIES TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. , OF LIFE AND OUR CITIES AND TOWNS. [APPLAUSE] BY CONTRAST, JOE BIDEN BELIEVES AMERICA IS, IN HIS WORDS, ""SYSTEMICALLY RACIST,"" AND DESPITE HISTORICALLY LOW CRIME RATES PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC, JOE BIDEN BELIEVES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN AMERICA HAS A ""IMPLICIT BIAS"" AGAINST MINORITIES. JUST RECENTLY, WHEN ASKED WHETHER HE WOULD SUPPORT DEFUNDING THE POLICE, JOE BIDEN CAPITULATED TO THE RADICAL LEFT-WING MOB. HE WAS ASKED IF HE SUPPORTED CUTTING FUNDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HE REPLIED, AND I QUOTE, ""YES, ABSOLUTELY."" HE WOULD WEAKEN THE THIN BLUE LINE THAT SEPARATES ORDER FROM CHAOS. UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WE WILL STAND WITH THOSE AND STAND ON THE THIN BLUE LINE AND WE WILL NEVER DEFUND THE POLICE. WE WILL DEFEND THE POLICE EVERY DAY. THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL BACK THE BLUE. [APPLAUSE] THE HARD TRUTH IS YOU WON'T BE SAFE AND JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA , IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA. THE RADICAL LEFT EXPERIMENT OF DEFUNDING THE POLICE IS FAILING FAMILIES IN CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ALREADY. RECENTLY AMID DEFUNDING EFFORTS AROUND AMERICA, CITIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH RISING CRIME RATES. ATLANTA SAW A 19% RISE IN SHOOTINGS, A 9% INCREASE IN MURDERS. IN CHICAGO, A 42% RISE IN SHOOTINGS AND A 39% INCREASE IN MURDERS. IN PHILADELPHIA, 54% RISE IN SHOOTINGS. A NEARLY 20% INCREASE IN MURDERS. AS A RESULT OF MAYOR DE BLASIO'S DISBANDING OF THE ANTI-CRIME UNIT IN NEW YORK CITY, WHICH IS A DECISION MANY AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS ARE BEGGING HIM TO REVERSE, THAT CITY HAS ALREADY SEEN AN INCREASE OF A STAGGERING 277 SENT , 277% AND THE NUMBER OF DEMS SKYROCKETING , OF VICTIMS SKYROCKETING THESE ARE SHOCKING NUMBERS BUT NOT SURPRISING. HERE IN WISCONSIN, THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE HAS SEEN A 50% INCREASE OF NONFATAL SHOOTINGS AND A100 PERCENT INCREASE IN MURDERS FROM THE SAME TIME LAST YEAR. IT IS ON PACE TO BREAK THE RECORD OF THE HOMICIDE RATE SET 30 YEARS AGO. THIS IS A FRIGHTENING PREVIEW OF JOE BIDEN'S AGENDA AND ACTION. AFTER YEARS OF PLUMMETING CRIME RATES UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, JOE BIDEN WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON THE VERY POLICIES THAT ARE LEADING TO UNSAFE STREETS AND VIOLENCE IN AMERICAN CITIES. WHEN YOU HEAR JOE BIDEN CALL FOR DEFUNDING THE POLICE, REMEMBER WHAT IS AT STAKE , LAW AND ORDER, SAFETY, THE PEACE OF MIND THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND CHILDREN HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO ENJOY AS CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY. WHEN YOU CONSIDER JOE BIDEN'S AGENDA IN HIS EMBRACE OF THE RADICAL LEFT, IT IS CLEAR , JOE BIDEN WOULD BE NOTHING MORE THANA A TROJAN HORSE FOR A RADICAL AGENDA. SO RADICAL, SO ALL-ENCOMPASSING IT WOULD TRANSFORM THIS COUNTRY INTO SOMETHING UTTERLY UNRECOGNIZABLE. IT IS NO WONDER THAT SOCIALIST BERNIE SANDERS SAID THAT IF JOE BIDEN WAS ELECTED, HE WOULD, IN HIS WORDS, TRANSFORM THE COUNTRY AND BE THE MOST PROGRESSIVE PRESIDENT IN A CENTURY. THE BIDEN-SANDERS AGENDA WOULD SET AMERICA ON THE PATH OF SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. AS OUR NATION ENDURES THIS TIME OF TESTING, WE WOULD DO WELL TO TELL OUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS IT IS TIME FOR CHOOSING. WE NEED TO TELL OUR FELLOW AMERICANS THAT WE CAN CHOOSE TO STAY ON THE PATH THAT STARTS FROM THE BELIEF IN THE GOODNESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT STARTS FROM THE PREMISE THAT AMERICA IS EXCEPTIONAL AND FOUNDED ON FREEDOM, ALWAYS STRIVING FOR A MORE PERFECT UNION. JUST LAST WEEK, PRESIDENT TRUMP SPOKE AT A ROUNDTABLE WITH A CUBAN IMMIGRANT NAMED MAXIMO ALVAREZ. MAXIMO ESCAPED COMMUNIST CUBA AT 13. HE WAS ONE OF THE LESS KIDS TO FLEE WITH A GROUP OF NUNS IS CONFIDENT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THE COMMUNIST DICTATOR THAT BERNIE SANDERS HAS PRAISED IN THE PAST. MAXIMO HAD A STARK WARNING FOR OUR COUNTRY AT THAT FORUM. HE SAID, ""WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR BACKYARD TODAY I EXPERIENCED AS AN 11-YEAR-OLD."" HE WENT ON TO SAY, ""I REMEMBER VIVIDLY ALL OF THE PROMISES CASTRO GAVE, I REMEMBER THE PROMISES WE HEAR TODAY ABOUT FREE EDUCATION, FREE HEALTH CARE, FREE LAND."" THEN HE RECALLED WHAT HIS FATHER TOLD HIM ABOUT THE GLORY OF AN AMERICAN. HE SAID THAT HIS FATHER TOLD HIM, ""DON'T LOSE THAT PLACE, BECAUSE IF YOU LOSE THAT PLACE, YOU WILL HAVE NO PLACE TO GO."" AMERICA IS A BEACON OF HOPE AND FREEDOM FOR ALL IN THE WORLD. [APPLAUSE] MAXIMO'S ADMONITION REMIND US OF ANOTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO FAMOUSLY REMINDED US THAT FREEDOM IS NEVER MORE THAN ONE GENERATION AWAY FROM EXTENSION , EXTINCTION. WE DON'T PASS IT ONTO OUR CHILDREN IN THE BLOODSTREAM, IT MUST BE FOUGHT FOR, PROTECTED, HANDED ON FOR THEM TO THE SAME , TO DO THE SAME. OR, PRESIDENT REAGAN ATTIC, , ADDED, ONE DAY WE WILL TELL OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO LIVE IN THE U.S. WHEN IT WAS FREE. WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM AGAIN. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN WAS RIGHT IN HIS TIME. I PROMISE YOU THAT FIGHTER IN THE WHITE HOUSE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THE FREEDOM OF EVERY AMERICAN. AND SO WE MUST FIGHT FOR HIM. [APPLAUSE] MY FELLOW AMERICANS, THAT IS THE CHOICE WE FACE. WE HAVE TWO PATHS FORWARD. ONE OF FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY, THE OTHER OF SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. WE CAN EITHER BE TRUE TO OURSELVES ON WHAT HAS MADE THIS NATION A BEACON OF HOPE FOR THE WORLD OR WE CAN BECOME LIKE THE VERY PLACES THAT MANY OF OUR ANCESTORS FLED AND THAT MANY STILL FLEE TO COME HERE. IN PONDERING THE DECISION BEFORE US, I CAN'T HELP THINK OF THE WORDS OF THE GREAT AMERICAN POET, ROBERT FROST, MY WIFE'S FAVORITE POET. HE WROTE, ""TWO ROADS DIVERGED IN A YELLOW WOOD AND I TOOK THE ONE LESS TRAVELED BY AND THAT HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE."" THE TRUTH IS, THROUGH THE LONG AND STRAIGHT HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY , AND STORIED HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY, AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS CHOSEN THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED BY, THE ROAD OF FREEDOM AND INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY. AND I KNOW WE WILL DO SO AGAIN. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE LIKE OUR PRESIDENT AND THOSE WHO FOUNDED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SOMEBODY YEARS AGO HERE IN RIPON, I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM AND I KNOW THIS IS A FREEDOM LOVING NATION. [APPLAUSE] I KNOW THE LOVE OF FREEDOM'S IN THE HEART OF EVERY AMERICAN AND I KNOW WE WILL CHOOSE WELL AGAIN THIS NOVEMBER BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH. FAITH THAT EVERY TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN FREEDOM AND US FREEDOM , LESS FREEDOM, THEY STAND FOR FREEDOM, THEY FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, AND THEY CHOOSE FREEDOM EVERY SINGLE TIME. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A FREEDOM LOVING NATION. IT IS ALSO A NATION OF EIGHTH , FAITH. IT IS ON THAT HOPE I STAND AS WELL. THE BIBLE SAYS WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS, THERE IS FREEDOM. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS BELIEVE AS I DO THAT WHEN WE STAND UP FOR THE GOD-GIVEN FREEDOMS OF LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, THE FREEDOMS WON AND DEFENDED THROUGH OUR NATIONS HISTORY, WE MAKE HIS WORK ON THIS EARTH OUR OWN. AND THAT MEANS FREEDOM ALWAYS WINS. [APPLAUSE] SO THAT IS THE CHOICE WE FACE, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, BETWEEN FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY OR SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. I HAVE NO DOUBT IF ALL OF US DO ALL WE CAN, EVEN IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER 3, WE WILL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH. WE WILL BE THERE FOR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS. WE WILL HEAL OUR LAND AND WHEN A GREAT VICTORY FOR FREEDOM AND OUR VERY WAY OF LIFE. WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR MORE YEARS , FOUR MORE YEARS, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AGAIN. THANK YOU. GOD BLESS WISCONSIN AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] (music) (music) (music) THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PARTIES, THE CAMPAIGNS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN, ADJUSTING PLANS FOR NEXT MONTH'S POLITICAL CONVENTIONS. THE DEMOCRATS WILL CONVENE FOR A SCALED-BACK CONVENTION IN MILWAUKEE STARTING AUGUST 17 AND THE REPUBLICANS MEET THE FOLLOWING WEEK ON TUESDAY, AUGUST 25 IN JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA FOR THEIR CONVENTION.

C-SPAN, YOUR UNFILTERED VIEW OF POLITICS."	HELLO, WISCONSIN. THANK YOU FOR THAT WARM WELCOME. TO CONGRESS MINGLING GROSSMAN, CONGRESSMAN BRIAN STILES, STATE SENATORS, MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE, HONORED GUESTS AND MY FELLOW AMERICANS, IT IS GOOD TO BE HERE IN RIPON, WISCONSIN, THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE BADGER STATE WITH SO MANY GREAT AMERICANS. AND THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY. ALLOW ME TO BEGIN BY BRINGING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER GREAT FAN OF THE BADGER STATE, A MAN WHO LOVES THE STATE OF WISCONSIN AND HAS BEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS AND WAS IN THIS STATE NOT LONG AGO. ALLOW ME TO BRING GREETINGS FROM THE 45TH AS AN OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. , PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS, PRESIDENT TRUMP DID KEEP EVERY PROMISE HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE RESULTS WERE EXTRAORDINARY. WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY, CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD, ROLLED BACK REGULATIONS AT A RECORD PACE, UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY, FOUGHT FOR FREE AND THEIR TRADE, AND IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS ALONE, BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED MORE THAN 7 MILLION NEW JOBS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WAGES ROSE AT THE FASTEST PACE IN MORE THAN 10 YEARS. 10 MILLION AMERICANS WERE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY AND 7 MILLION AMERICANS WERE LIFTED OUT OF FOOD STAMPS. BEYOND THAT, WE REACHED THE HIGHEST MEDIAN INCOME IN THE HISTORY OF UNITED STATES. IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY THREE YEARS OF PROGRESS AND RENEWAL, BUILDING OUR MILITARY, REVIVING OUR ECONOMY. BUT THEN THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC STRUCK OUR NATION. PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK UNPRECEDENTED ACTION. HE PUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF AMERICA FIRST FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS. BEFORE THE MONTH OF JANUARY WAS OVER, HE SUSPENDED TRAVEL FROM CHINA AND STOOD UP THE WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWS, WE HAVE DEVELOPED NOT ONLY A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT WHICH BUT A WHOLE OF AMERICA APPROACH. WE HAVE MARSHALED THE FULL RESOURCES OF AMERICA TO SAVE LIVES AND PROTECT THE VULNERABLE AND SUPPORT OF THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF DOCTORS AND NURSES US THE COUNTRY. I WILL MAKE YOU A PROMISE , AS WE CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, WILL , WE WILL WORK 24 HOURS A DAY TO ENSURE THAT ALL STATES IMPACTED, ALL HOSPITALS AND GREAT HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE THE SUPPLIES AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO GIVE EVERY AMERICAN THE SAME LEVEL OF CARE THAT WE WOULD WANT A MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY TO HAVE. WE ARE MEETING THIS MOMENT WITH AMERICAN COMPASSION AND AMERICAN RESOLVE. WE ARE ALSO OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN. IT IS EXTRAORDINARY TO THINK THAT AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, OUR ECONOMY LOST 22 MILLION JOBS. BECAUSE OF THE STRONG FOUNDATION PRESIDENT TRUMP LAID OF LESS TAXES AND LESS REGULATION, INTO SHORT MONTHS, MAY AND JUNE, SAW RECORD-BREAKING JOB CREATION. WE HAVE ADDED 7 MILLION JOBS ACT TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. WE ALL KNOW, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, THAT WE ARE PASSING THROUGH A TIME OF TESTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SOON WE WILL COME TO A TIME FOR CHOOSING, WHICH IS WHAT BRINGS ME HERE TODAY. IN 110 DAYS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE. THE CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER AND THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. I CAME HERE TO THE CITY OF RIPON , WISCONSIN CAMERA WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY , WISCONSIN, WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS BORN, TO DESCRIBE THAT CHOICE. IN 1854, THEY WROTE THAT THE DECISION TO FOUND A NEW POLITICAL PARTY HAD BEEN 'FORCED UPON US BY THE SLAVE POWER AND IN THE DEFENSE OF FREEDOM.' THEY SAID THEY WOULD COOPERATE AND BE KNOWN AS REPUBLICANS, AND SO THEY HAVE EVER BEEN. SEARS LATER, THEY ELECTED THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, , SIX YEARS LATER, THEY ELECTED THE FIRST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, WHO USHERED IN THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF OUR HIGHEST IDEALS. FOUR MONTHS FROM NOW, I KNOW OUR PARTY WILL REELECT ANOTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHEN WE REELECT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IT IS WHY I AM HERE TODAY, TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE AND TO TALK ABOUT THE CHOICE OUR NATION FACES. OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS ON THE BALLOT, BUT SO ARE THINGS FAR MORE FUNDAMENTAL AND FOUNDATIONAL TO OUR COUNTRY. IT'S NOT SO MUCH WHETHER AMERICA WILL BE MORE CONSERVATIVE MORE LIBERAL, MORE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, MORE RED OR BLUE. IT IS WHETHER AMERICA REMAINS AMERICA. WHETHER WE WILL LEAVE TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN A COUNTRY GROUNDED IN OUR HIGHEST IDEALS OF FREEDOM, FREE MARKET, THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS TO LIFE AND LIBERTY, OR WHETHER WE WILL LEAVE TO THEM A COUNTRY THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING ELSE. LIKE THOSE FIRST REPUBLICANS, WE STAND AT A CROSSROADS OF FREEDOM. BEFORE US ARE TEWOWO PATHS, ONE BASED ON THE DIGNITY OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL, AND THE OTHER ON THE GROWING CONTROL OF THE STATE. OUR ROAD LEADS TO GREATER FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY. THERE ROAD LEADS TO SOCIALISM , THEIR ROAD LISA SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. PRESIDENT TRUMP SET US ON A PATH OF FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. JOE BIDEN WOULD SET AMERICA ON THE PATH OF SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. AMERICA IS A BLESSED AND EXCEPTIONAL COUNTRY, UNIQUE AMONG THE NATIONS. WE HAVE BEEN AN ASYLUM OF HOPE FOR MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE, AS THE WORDS ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY DECLARE. MANY OF OUR GREATEST CITIZENS HAVE COME FROM CORNERS OF THE RULED , OF THE WORLD RULED BY SOCIALIST REGIMES. IF YOU EVER DOUBT WHETHER THIS COUNTRY IS SPECIAL AND UNIQUE, JUST TALK TO ONE OF THEM. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, PRESIDENT TRUMP SET OUR NATION ON THAT PATH READ HIM AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY AMERICAN REGARDLESS OF RACE, CREED OR COLOR. AMERICA'S FAMILIES ENJOYED RECORD LOW CRIME RATES, RECORD HIGH PROSPERITY, THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF A GOVERNMENT DEVOTED TO LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT NOW ALL OF THAT IS UNDER THREAT. JOE BIDEN HAS REFERRED TO HIMSELF AS A TRANSITION CANDIDATE. BUT MANY WERE ASKING ACROSS THIS COUNTRY , A TRANSITION TO WHAT? NOW WE HAVE THE ANSWER. RECENTLY, JOE BIDEN COMBINED FORCES WITH THE SOCIALIST BERNIE SANDERS AND THE RADICAL LEFT WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE DON'T NEED TO GUESS WHERE THEY ARE PLANNING TO TAKE AMERICA. BIDEN AND SANDERS RECENTLY RELEASED A DOCUMENT FROM THEIR UNITY TASK FORCE OUTLINING THEIR AGENDA FOR THE COUNTRY. READING THAT DOCUMENT, I THOUGHT JOE BIDEN WON THE DEMOCRAT PRIMARY, BUT LOOKING AT THE DOCUMENT, IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE BERNIE WON. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AGENDA, THE ONLY THING IT IS UNIFYING IS JOE BIDEN TO THE RADICAL LEFT. CONTRARY TO THEIR RADICAL AGENDA, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS REBUILDING THE ECONOMY BASED ON FREEDOM AND FREE MARKETS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DID IT ONCE BEFORE AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WILL DO IT AGAIN. AT THE ROOT OF THE BIDEN-SANDERS AGENDA IS A BELIEF THAT AMERICA IS DRIVEN BY IN THE, NOT ASPIRATION. THAT , BY ENVY, NOT ASPIRATION. THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HARBOR ILL WILL TOWARD THEIR NEIGHBORS. THE RADICAL LEFT BELIEVES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST BE INVOLVED IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES TO CORRECT THOSE AMERICAN WRONGS. THEY BELIEVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO DICTATE HOW AMERICANS LIVE, HOW WE SHOULD WORK, HOW WE SHOULD RAISE OUR CHILDREN, AND IN THE PROCESS THE PRIVATE OUR PEOPLE OF FREEDOM , DEPRIVE OUR PEOPLE OF FREEDOM, PROSPERITY AND SECURITY. THEIR AGENDA IS BASED ON GOVERNMENT CONTROL. OUR AGENDA IS BASED ON FREEDOM. JUST LOOK AT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN OUR RECORD AND THE BIDEN AGENDA. PRESIDENT TRUMP CUT TAXES BY $5.5 TRILLION, THE LARGEST TAX CUT AND REFORM IN AMERICAN HISTORY. JOE BIDEN PLANS TO INCREASE TAXES BY NEARLY $4 TRILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE ALONE. TWICE AS MUCH AS HILLARY CLINTON EVER PROPOSED. PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT ONLY CUT TAXES, BUT WE HAVE ROLLED BACK FEDERAL RED TAPE AT A HISTORIC CASE , PACE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS REPEALED MORE FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAN IN THE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY, ENABLING ECONOMY TO ADD A MILLION JOBS IN THE LAST TWO MONTH ALONE. , 8 MILLION JOBS IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS ALONE. JOE BIDEN WOULD PROPOSE AN AVALANCHE OF REGULATIONS ON OUR ECONOMY, STIFLING THE ECONOMY AND COSTING AMERICAN JOBS. WHEN IT COMES TO AMERICAN JOBS, IT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO SAID THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER IS OVER, AND HE STOOD UP TO CHINA. HE FOUGHT FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE. JUST THE OTHER DAY, HE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER HOLDING CHINA ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS TREATMENT OF HONG KONG, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO STAND STRONG. JOE BIDEN PRETENDS TO BE TOUGH ON CHINA BUT THE REALITY IS THAT NO BIDEN HAS HELPED CHINA ALL ALONG THE WAY, ATTAINING MOST FAVORED NATION STATUS IN THE WTO. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID NOTHING WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS VICE PRESIDENT TO PREVENT THE OUTSOURCING OF MILLIONS OF JOBS IN MANUFACTURING TO THAT COMMUNIST NATION. AND RESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS STOOD FOR OUR HIGHEST IDEALS AT HOME AND ABROAD. IT WAS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHO WITHDREW AMERICA FROM THE JOB KILLING PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD AND SAVED THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN JOBS. JOE BIDEN WANTS TO JOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD AGAIN, PLACING A CRUSHING WEIGHT ON AMERICAN BUSINESS AND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE U.S. HAS ACHIEVED ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NO LONGER RELYING ON THE MIDDLE EAST FOR OIL, AND NOW AMERICA IS A NET EXPORTER OF ENERGY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 75 YEARS. JOE BIDEN WOULD DESTROY OUR FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY, RETURN TO THE WAR ON COAL, PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICA'S IMMENSE ENERGY RESERVES AND POSE A REGIME OF CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS ON LITERALLY EVERY NEW BUILDING ON THE UNITED , IN THE UNITED STATES, EVERY HOME, EVERY BUSINESS, THAT WOULD DRASTICALLY INCREASE THE COST OF LIVING FOR FAMILIES AND THE COST OF BUSINESSES, AT THE COST OF JOBS. WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACHIEVED A HISTORIC DECLINE IN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, JOE BIDEN SUPPORTS GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD SET US ON AN INEXORABLE PATH TO SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES IN A STRONG BORDER FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AS OUR PRESIDENT HAS SAID MANY TIMES, DON'T HAVE ORDERS, YOU DON'T HAVE A NATION. AS WE STAND HERE TODAY, I AM PROUD TO REPORT WE HAVE ALREADY BUILT 200 MILES OF THAT BORDER WALL ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE COURAGEOUS MEN AND WOMEN OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AND ICE EVERY DAY. JOE BIDEN IS FOR OPEN BORDERS. THEIR AGENDA CALLS FOR AN END TO DEPORTATIONS, SUPPORT FOR SANCTUARY CITIES, THREE LAWYERS AND FREE HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, ALL PAID FOR BY AMERICAN TAXPAYERS. IT IS EXTRAORDINARY. AND CLOSER TO HOME, THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR ALLOWING EVERY PARENT TO CHOOSE WHERE THEIR CHILDREN GOES TO SCHOOL REGARDLESS OF INCOME OR AREA CODE. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP STANDS FOR SCHOOL CHOICE. AND HERE IN WISCONSIN, THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE SCHOOL CHOICE MOVEMENT IN AMERICA, YOU DESERVE TO KNOW. JOE BIDEN WOULD TAKE AWAY THE RIGHT OF PARENTS TO CHOOSE WHERE THEIR CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL , PUBLIC, PRIVATE OR PAROCHIAL. YOU NEED TO TELL YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS. JOE BIDEN WANTS TO END SCHOOL CHOICE. THOSE ARE THE FACTS. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT OUR ECONOMY AND DEFENDING AMERICAN JOBS AND HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. I CANNOT BE MORE PROUD TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO A PRESIDENT WHO HAS STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. BY CONTRAST, JOE BIDEN SUPPORTS TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION. REPEALING THE HYDE AMENDMENT, ENDING A POLICY THAT SUPPORTS ABORTIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION AT HOME. LET ME SAY, DON'T EVER DOUBT , PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND THIS ADMINISTRATION STAND WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE PRESIDENT AND I KNOW THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT ON THE UNIFORM OF LAW-ENFORCEMENT EVERYDAY ARE THE BEST OF US. THEY RISK THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY. THEY CONSIDER OUR LIVES MORE ORGANS THAN THEIR OWN , OUR LIVES MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEIR OWN AND THEY HAVE OUR SUPPORT. IT IS A FALSE CHOICE TO THINK WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS. UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WE WILL SO LAW ENFORCEMENT, IMPROVE THE LOOK SAFETY, AND STAND WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES AND ALL MINORITIES TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. , OF LIFE AND OUR CITIES AND TOWNS. BY CONTRAST, JOE BIDEN BELIEVES AMERICA IS, IN HIS WORDS, 'SYSTEMICALLY RACIST,' AND DESPITE HISTORICALLY LOW CRIME RATES PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC, JOE BIDEN BELIEVES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN AMERICA HAS A 'IMPLICIT BIAS' AGAINST MINORITIES. JUST RECENTLY, WHEN ASKED WHETHER HE WOULD SUPPORT DEFUNDING THE POLICE, JOE BIDEN CAPITULATED TO THE RADICAL LEFT-WING MOB. HE WAS ASKED IF HE SUPPORTED CUTTING FUNDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HE REPLIED, AND I QUOTE, 'YES, ABSOLUTELY.' HE WOULD WEAKEN THE THIN BLUE LINE THAT SEPARATES ORDER FROM CHAOS. UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WE WILL STAND WITH THOSE AND STAND ON THE THIN BLUE LINE AND WE WILL NEVER DEFUND THE POLICE. WE WILL DEFEND THE POLICE EVERY DAY. THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL BACK THE BLUE. THE HARD TRUTH IS YOU WON'T BE SAFE AND JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA , IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA. THE RADICAL LEFT EXPERIMENT OF DEFUNDING THE POLICE IS FAILING FAMILIES IN CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ALREADY. RECENTLY AMID DEFUNDING EFFORTS AROUND AMERICA, CITIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH RISING CRIME RATES. ATLANTA SAW A 19% RISE IN SHOOTINGS, A 9% INCREASE IN MURDERS.

IT IS ON PACE TO BREAK THE RECORD OF THE HOMICIDE RATE SET 30 YEARS AGO. THIS IS A FRIGHTENING PREVIEW OF JOE BIDEN'S AGENDA AND ACTION. AFTER YEARS OF PLUMMETING CRIME RATES UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, JOE BIDEN WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON THE VERY POLICIES THAT ARE LEADING TO UNSAFE STREETS AND VIOLENCE IN AMERICAN CITIES. WHEN YOU HEAR JOE BIDEN CALL FOR DEFUNDING THE POLICE, REMEMBER WHAT IS AT STAKE , LAW AND ORDER, SAFETY, THE PEACE OF MIND THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND CHILDREN HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO ENJOY AS CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY. WHEN YOU CONSIDER JOE BIDEN'S AGENDA IN HIS EMBRACE OF THE RADICAL LEFT, IT IS CLEAR , JOE BIDEN WOULD BE NOTHING MORE THANA A TROJAN HORSE FOR A RADICAL AGENDA.

AMERICA IS A BEACON OF HOPE AND FREEDOM FOR ALL IN THE WORLD. MAXIMO'S ADMONITION REMIND US OF ANOTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO FAMOUSLY REMINDED US THAT FREEDOM IS NEVER MORE THAN ONE GENERATION AWAY FROM EXTENSION , EXTINCTION. WE DON'T PASS IT ONTO OUR CHILDREN IN THE BLOODSTREAM, IT MUST BE FOUGHT FOR, PROTECTED, HANDED ON FOR THEM TO THE SAME , TO DO THE SAME.

THE TRUTH IS, THROUGH THE LONG AND STRAIGHT HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY , AND STORIED HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY, AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS CHOSEN THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED BY, THE ROAD OF FREEDOM AND INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY. AND I KNOW WE WILL DO SO AGAIN. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE LIKE OUR PRESIDENT AND THOSE WHO FOUNDED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SOMEBODY YEARS AGO HERE IN RIPON, I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM AND I KNOW THIS IS A FREEDOM LOVING NATION. I KNOW THE LOVE OF FREEDOM'S IN THE HEART OF EVERY AMERICAN AND I KNOW WE WILL CHOOSE WELL AGAIN THIS NOVEMBER BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH.

The campaign event in support of President Trump&rsquo;s reelection was held in the same town where the political group that became the Republican Party first met in 1854. During his speech, Vice President Pence cast the 2020 presidential election as a choice between prosperity under capitalism and hardship under socialism. He touted the administration&rsquo;s response to the economic shutdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic, saying record job growth in states reopening their economies were bolstered by the anti-regulatory actions taken by the Trump White House.	473913-1		
CSPANMP3072020155	Mike Pence	2020-07-30	Vice President Pence Remarks on the Economy	Speech	"Well, hello, Pennsylvania! Thank you so much to Karen Kelley for all the great work she does; to Guy Berkebile and the great people of Guy Chemical. It is great to be here in Somerset County, where people of the Commonwealth are driving a great American comeback. Thank you so much. (Applause.) I'm really honored to be with you all and I appreciate - I appreciate that warm welcome. It's great to be among so many friends. And while we're getting started, let me bring greetings from a friend of mine. I called him from Air Force Two, told him I was headed to Pennsylvania to be with all you good people, and I think he sounded just a little bit jealous. (Laughter.) So allow me to bring greetings from a man who loves the Keystone State and has been fighting to keep the promises that he made to the people of Pennsylvania for the last three and a half years. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. You know, it really is great to be back in Somerset County, and, please, you can take a seat. It's great to be back in Somerset County. It's a place of great families; great businesses, just like this one; great family farms; and I know and I say from my heart, having been in Washington, D.C. on that fateful day, now nearly 20 years ago, this is a place where America will forever remember the heroes forged in the skies on Flight 93, and I thank you for this community's devotion to that vital memorial. You know, on a personal level, let me also say Somerset County is pretty special to the Pence family. I was telling some of the team here at Guy Chemical earlier, all my kids - one of whom is a Marine, married; another one who's married to a Navy pilot; another one, who just finished her schooling - all of them spent every summer for 10 years at Summer's Best Two Weeks. And we just love Somerset County and the role that it played on their faith and their upbringing. (Applause.) So thank you all for that. I know so many churches in the region play a critical role in that - that wonderful place, and I hope you'll give them all regards. And it really is great to be here at Guy Chemical. We just got a tour from your CEO. And I'll tell you what: It is entrepreneurs like Guy and companies like Guy Chemical that represent the very best of America. This is a place that believes in hard work, in sacrifice, in loving your neighbor, and you can find it all right here in Somerset County at this great company. Now, it's amazing to think of all we accomplished over the last three and a half years. After fr- - after three years of leadership under President Donald Trump, this economy was booming. And President Trump, as I said, literally kept every promise that he made to the people of Pennsylvania and then some and the results were extraordinary. We cut taxes across the board for working families, businesses, and family farms. This President rolled back more federal regulations already than any President in American history. (Applause.) We fought for free and fair trade. We just signed the new USMCA deal into law, and we fought for American energy. And we're a net exporter of American energy now for the first time in 70 years. (Applause.) And none of that would have been possible without the strong support in our first two years of Republican majorities in the House of Representatives. And I would be remiss today if I didn't take a moment not just to acknowledge, but to thank a strong, conservative leader in the Congress of the United States who was there every step of the way as we brought this economy all the way back in our first three years. Join me in thanking Congressman John Joyce for all the great work that he does for this state and this nation. (Applause.) Thank you, John. What a great guy. With Congressman Joyce's support and President Trump's leadership, the results were amazing. In our first three years alone, businesses large and small created more than 8 million jobs. Wages were rising at their fastest pace in nearly 10 years, and they were rising most rapidly for hardworking, blue- collar Americans. In the first three years of this administration, the forgotten men and women of America were forgotten no more. That's what we call promises made and promises kept. (Applause.) Two million Americans were lifted out of poverty. Seven million Americans were lifted off food stamps. And we reached the highest median income in the history of this country. And as I mentioned, America made enormous strides toward energy independence. We are now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. This President is going to continue to support policies that allow us to develop all of the resources in this land, and that includes - we're going to support fracking in Pennsylvania and the thousands of jobs that it supports. Now, the people of Pennsylvania deserve to know that if the other side gets their way, the future is going to look very different. It's true. I mean, with Joe Biden and the Democratic Party - instead of cutting taxes, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party want to raise taxes by $4 trillion. They want to bury our economy under an avalanche of regulation. And Joe Biden and the Democrats have a $2 trillion plan to abolish fossil fuels, including natural gas. They want to end fracking - destroy those jobs all across this state and all across this nation. You know, whereas Joe Biden and the Democrats propose policies that'll stifle jobs and wages and energy, President Donald Trump and I are going to fight for a growing America. Less government, less taxes, less regulation, and more American energy. You know, it really is amazing - it really is amazing when you think about those first three years. Pennsylvania employed a record number of workers, set a record in history, and gained back nearly 20,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember the last administration? The summer of 2016, the last President said, when he was asked about bringing back manufacturing jobs and they'd lost hundreds of thousands of jobs in the last administration - he said - he said, ""What are you going to - what are you going to have, a magic wand? How are you going to bring those jobs back?"" Well, we didn't need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House; 500,000 manufacturing jobs came roaring back in those first three years.  Median income rose in this state by $1,400 dollars and we established more than 300 Opportunity Zones in Pennsylvania alone in 289 low-income communities. We're fighting for the opportunities for every American. It's extraordinary. Hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians were lifted out of poverty. In all these areas - jobs, wages, Opportunity Zones, median income - America and Pennsylvania were outperforming the last eight years. I mean, the truth is, President Donald Trump achieved more in the last three and a half years then some politicians achieved in the last 30. And then 2020 came, and the coronavirus pandemic struck our nation. And I'm proud to report that even before the first instance of community transmission of the coronavirus in this country, President Trump took unprecedented action to put the health and safety of America first. And the truth is, our nation is going through a time of testing. And let me say from my heart that our prayers and our sympathies are with all of the more than 150,000 families that have lost loved ones in the midst of this pandemic. As we continue to contend with the coronavirus in various places across our country, President Trump and our team, and the task force will continue to marshal the full resources of the federal government and the full power of the American economy to meet this moment and put the health of America first. I promise you. I mean, even before the month of January was out, President Trump took the unprecedented step of suspending all travel from China - the second-largest economy in the world. He asked me to lead the Coronavirus Task Force that he also set up before the first month of the year was over. We've reinvented testing from a standing start. As of today, we've done 55 million coronavirus tests - many, many times more than any country in the world. We've manufactured and directed hundreds of millions of medical supplies to hospitals across the country, and we're continuing to do that in hotspots across America today. And working with our great medical companies, I'm proud to report we're distributing medicines and we are well on our way to developing a vaccine for the American people by the end of this year. (Applause.) It's amazing. Only in America could you have seen the whole-of-the-nation response that's been led by President Donald Trump. With the cooperation of all of you and people across this country, we're going to make our way through this challenging time. The truth is, we're actually beginning to see encouraging trends - even across the Sun Belt, where coronavirus cases have risen dramatically over the last three weeks. So we all should remain vigilant. We all should do our part: practice good hygiene, wear a mask whenever it's indicated, protect the vulnerable. And I promise you, we're going to work every day to make sure that every American impacted in this pandemic has the same level of healthcare any one of us would want for a member of our family. We're going to work around the clock to hasten the day that we have a vaccine, and we will put this coronavirus in the past once and for all. But from the onset of this pandemic, President Trump didn't just marshal a response to the health challenges our nation faced, but the President also made it clear that we were going to do whatever it took to get American families and American businesses through these challenging times. We worked with the Congress, leaders in both political parties, to secure resources to make direct payments to every American. We launched what's called the Paycheck Protection Program that allowed businesses just like this one to be able to keep people on the payroll during those early difficult days where businesses were required to shut down. And thanks to the heroic efforts of our healthcare workers and this President's leadership, the American people, and great companies like Guy Chemical, every day we are one day closer to putting the coronavirus in the past, and we're already opening up America again. It's amazing to think, at the lowest point in this pandemic, our economy lost 22 million jobs. But thanks to that solid foundation that President Trump laid in our first three years, we've already gained back 8 million jobs just in May and June alone, including 440,000 jobs right here in Pennsylvania. The great American comeback is underway. It's because of that foundation that was poured, but mostly it's because of hardworking people like all of you who have labored through this challenging time, looked after your neighbors and loved ones and friends, and gone right back to work. You know, President Lincoln once said, ""I'm always for the man who wishes to work."" And I promise you, President Donald Trump feels the same way. We are for working Americans and going back to work. This President and I know and believe that hard work is at the very heart of the American Dream, and the American people -the American people love to work hard. That's why we're always going to choose the path of greater freedom and greater opportunity. We're going to continue to advance policies that will make it possible for more businesses around America to do just what Guy Chemical has done, and that is: show resilience and generosity, and open the doors of businesses, and put America back to work. Which brings me to Guy and Guy Chemical. You know, Guy, I not only want to thank you for your hospitality today, but I want to thank you for your leadership. You exemplify what is making this great American comeback happen all over the nation. And we thank you for your leadership, and for your family, and for your devotion to all the great people of this company and this community.  I learned all about Guy on my way here. His story shows us at the end of the day, this is a - this is a company that's not just about facts and figures; this is a company, first and foremost, that's about people, families, and the dignity and the importance that comes from hard work. You know, I'm told that, in Guy's first few years, the company lost money and Guy didn't earn a salary for five years. Guy always made sure he paid his employees before he paid himself. He mortgaged his house seven times. And he and his wonderful wife and their family made huge sacrifices during those years. When they were young, Guy's kids, I'm told, would bring their sleeping bags and video game to stay overnight at the plant because somebody had to watch them, and Mom had to work. You hinged your family's future to the success of this company every single day, and it all paid off. Your faith, your determination, your vision, your hard work, and your love for this community and these people - Guy Chemical became, Inc. - an Inc. 500 company. And in 2013, Guy chemical was the SBA Exporter of the Year. (Applause.) Wow. At the beginning in January 2017, you began growing at a rate unequaled in those previous 25 years. He told me, standing in the back - we talked a little bit about faith, family, and then he said to me that, thanks to President Trump's tax cut, Guy Chemical has been able to grow and expand every day since. You bought new equipment; I got to see some of it. And I don't know how it works, but it was very impressive. You bought that new equipment, sales grew by 9 million, and you were able to hire another 29 new people in this community. Washington taxed you less, and you increased the salaries and bonuses for the workers at Guy Chemical. In 2019 alone, you all deserve to know that Guy and Guy chemical raised wages for plant employees by 10 to 15 percent. And since President Trump took office and we got those tax cuts done, this company has grown by 33 percent. That's how America grows.  But like every other business in America, when the pandemic hit, Guy Chemical took a hit. But that didn't stop Guy or this great family or this great team. It's really impressive to me that you didn't close. You extended a hand of support to your employees. And thanks to your quick action, you were able to become part of the solution. I'm told that in just one short week, you received FDA approval and Guy Chemicals started producing hand sanitizers and providing them all over the state and all over America. That's what it means to be part of the solution. (Applause.) And you donated thousands of hand sanitizers to businesses and organizations and churches all across the region. You're part of a great American comeback, and it's a comeback that starts right here with heart. It's the heart for your faith in God, which everybody who knows you knows is real. It's your foundation. But it's so heart for your family, it's a heart for all these great people that's driving a great American comeback at this great company - and frankly, all over Pennsylvania and all over America. Hard work, sacrifice, loving your neighbor as yourself - it's what brings Pennsylvania back, and it's going to bring America all the way back. In fact, this company is already making plans. Guy - Guy told me when I got here that, thanks to those tax cuts - the ability to expense - expense the investment in equipment and all the other tax cuts that were put into effect over the last three and a half years - Guy Chemical is announcing today that they're making a $3.5 million investment right here in Somerset County. They're going to hire another 30 people and get this economy rolling again. (Applause.) Thanks for leading the great American comeback. You know, some people believe more government, more red tape, and pushing some Washington agenda is what makes America great. But I want to assure you, President Trump and I - we know that it's people like all of you, people at places like this, families, and businesses, and family farms all across Somerset County, you're what make America great. And you're going to make America great again. You're the ones who create the jobs. You're the ones who provide for your families the dignity of hard work. You're the ones who extend your hands in love to neighbors and friends in challenging times. You're the heart of the great American comeback, and I just came here to say thank you - thank you for all you've done. You know, I've long believed that faith and freedom in our vast natural resources are the pillars of American greatness. And here in Pennsylvania, you've built this Commonwealth through the generations on those same ideals and values: a belief in freedom and the development of the resources of this land, the goodness of your people, and on the grace of God. Here in a state that was founded on religious liberty, whose founder, William Penn, once famously said, ""I shall not usurp the right of any… for God has furnished me with a better resolution and [it] has given me [the] grace to keep it."" You have kept the faith in Pennsylvania, and so shall we.  And with confidence that He who was with William Penn when he founded the Commonwealth so long ago is still with us today, I say with confidence that with President Donald Trump in the White House, with faith and hard work of the great people of Somerset and of the Keystone State, I know the best days for Pennsylvania and America are yet to come. In our first three years, we made America great again. And with your support and prayers and hard work, we're going to make America great again, again. Thank you very much. (Applause.) God bless you. God bless Pennsylvania and God bless America."	Well, hello, Pennsylvania! Thank you so much to Karen Kelley for all the great work she does; to Guy Berkebile and the great people of Guy Chemical.

In our first three years, we made America great again. And with your support and prayers and hard work, we're going to make America great again, again. Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless Pennsylvania and God bless America.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?474381-1/vice-president-pence-remarks-economy	Vice President Mike Pence delivered remarks in Somerset, Pennsylvania, on the economy.	474381-1

CIRCUIT ON TUESDAY. THE PANEL OF 10 JUDGES WILL DECIDE WHETHER A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGE WILL DISMISS THE CHARGES AGAINST MICHAEL FLYNN. HEAR THE CASE LIVE TUESDAY AT 9:30 EASTERN ON C-SPAN AND C-SPAN.ORG OR LISTEN LIVE WITH THE FREE C-SPAN RADIO APP. AND NOW VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE SPEAKS IN CLEARWATER, FLORIDA. A CAMPAIGN RALLY. BEFORE DEPARTING, HE MEETS WITH SOME OF THE ATTENDEES. THIS IS ABOUT 40 MINUTES. HELLO, EVERYONE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. WELL, I HAVE THE HONOR AND JOY OF INTRODUCING A VERY SPECIAL PERSON TO ME, YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, MY DAD, MIKE PENCE, TODAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I'M TRAVELING WITH HIM ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TODAY. BUT FOUR YEARS AGO, I DID TRAVEL QUITE A LOT. I TRAVELED ALMOST EVERY DAY MY PARENTS WERE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FROM WHEN WE WERE PICKED IN JULY UP UNTIL ELECTION DAY. AND I SAW THE COUNTRY, SAW PLACES I'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE, AND I WAS INSPIRED BY SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE EXCITED ABOUT THIS MESSAGE AND STILL ARE TODAY. BUT A LOT HAPPENS IN FOUR YEARS. AND I KIND OF , I REALIZED EVEN MORE SO THAN IN THE PAST. EVEN THOUGH I'VE GROWN UP AROUND POLITICS. THAT CAMPAIGNS END AND THE DAY AFTER ELECTION DAY IS WHEN THE WORK REALLY STARTS. AND THAT'S I THINK WHEN TRUE CHARACTER AND LEADERSHIP IS REALLY PROVEN. I'VE BEEN SO IMPRESSED BUT NOT SURPRISED THAT THE COUNTRY HAS GOTTEN TO SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MY DAD REALLY LEAD IN A WAY THAT'S SHOWN THAT CHARACTER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND IMPROVE SO MANY LIVES. BUT 2020 HAS BEEN AN ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING YEAR. YEAH. FOR EVERYONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD. EVERYONE'S BEEN REALLY IMPACTED BY THIS. AND I THINK I'VE BEEN ESPECIALLY PROUD TO AND JUST REALLY BLESSED TO SEE MY DAD LEAD DURING THIS TIME, ESPECIALLY, WITH THE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE. PROBABLY THE MOST PROUD I'VE REALLY BEEN OF HIM IN HIS CAREER IN POLITICS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'VE BEEN ABLE TO WATCH FIRSTHAND THAT REALLY CALMING AND THAT STEADY NATURE THAT I KNOW HE'S HAD AS MY DAD MY WHOLE LIFE BUT I THINK THE COUNTRY REALLY GOT TO SEE THAT AS WELL. AND THROUGHOUT THE CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMIC , I MEAN, I HAD FRIENDS REACHING OUT TO ME FROM ALL SIDES OF THE AISLE, REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, PEOPLE WHO DON'T CARE AT ALL ABOUT EITHER ONE, TEXTING ME AND TELLING ME THAT WATCHING MY DAD EVERY DAY JUST REASSURED THEM. JUST GAVE THEM SOME EASE. [APPLAUSE] YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S TRUE. AND THAT ABILITY TO BE CALM IN THE MIDST OF THE STORM I THINK IS REALLY IRREPLACEABLE TRAIT. BUT OTHER THAN THAT , OTHER THAN A POLITICAL MESSAGE THAT MY DAD HAS TAUGHT ME, OTHER THAN THE ABILITY TO BE CALM IN A STORM IS THE LESSON FROM WHOM THAT PEACE REALLY COMES. IT DOESN'T COME, ACTUALLY, FROM US. IT DOESN'T COME FROM INSIDE OF HIM. THAT COMES FROM OUR FAITH IN GOD. [APPLAUSE] AND WE'LL ALL GO THROUGH MORE STORMS IN OUR LIVES, AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE STORMS BEFORE, BUT THE ABILITY TO REALLY FIND THAT PEACE AND TO KNOW WHO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SEEK IN THE MIDST OF A STORM I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON MY DAD HAS TAUGHT ME AND I THINK SHOWN THE COUNTRY DURING THIS TIME. SO WITH THAT, I'LL INTRODUCE TO YOU MY DAD, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: WELL, HELLO, FLORIDA! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE SUNSHINE STATE. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE EVER , I'VE EVER BEEN MORE MOVED THAN AN INTRODUCTION. I TELL YOU WHAT, MY DAUGHTER IS THE WIFE OF A NAVY PILOT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE IS AN AUTHOR AND A SPEAKER AND A GREAT CHAMPION FOR CONSERVATIVE VALUES. WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING CHARLOTTE PENCE BOND ONE MORE TIME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE'S A VOICE OF THE GENERATION. PROUD OF YOU. SO PROUD OF YOU. AND ALL OF YOU GATHERED HERE TODAY. TO MY FRIEND, CONGRESSMAN GUS BILIRAKIS IS HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH, CONGRESSMAN. MY FRIEND OF MANY YEARS. CHAIRMAN JOE. EVERYONE THAT'S COME OUT TODAY. I TELL YOU IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE SUNSHINE STATE FOR A TRUMP VICTORY RALLY CELEBRATING FAITH IN AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH IN AMERICA! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT IT'S SO GOOD TO BE WITH SO MANY FRIENDS FOR SO MANY YEARS. CONGRESSMAN BILIRAKIS AND I SERVED TOGETHER ON CAPITOL HILL. I WAS IN CONGRESS FOR 12 YEARS, ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED LONGER. [LAUGHTER] CONGRESSMAN, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, YOU HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION OF CONSERVATIVE VALUES EVERY DAY YOU SERVE FLORIDA IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND I'M PROUD. I'M PROUD TO CALL YOU A FRIEND. AND SPEAKING OF FRIENDS, ALLOW ME TO BRING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE. MAN WHO LOVES THE SUNSHINE STATE. AND WHEN I TOLD HIM LAST NIGHT I WAS HEADED DOWN TO FLORIDA, I THINK HE SOUNDED JUST A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS. SO ALLOW ME TO BRING GREETINGS AND GRATITUDE AT THIS FAITH IN AMERICA RALLY FROM THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHANTING ""FOUR MORE YEARS""] WELL, THANK YOU FOR THAT, EVERYBODY. IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU BUT I'M HERE AND HERE FOR ONE REASON ONLY. THAT'S BECAUSE FLORIDA AND AMERICA NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT REALLY IS AMAZING WHEN YOU THINK OF THE LAST 3 1/2 YEARS. IT'S BEEN 3 1/2 YEARS OF ACTION. 3 1/2 YEARS OF RESULTS. IT'S BEEN 3 1/2 YEARS OF PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT. I MEAN, FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS KEPT THE PROMISES THAT HE'S MADE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. TO THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. AND ESPECIALLY TO PEOPLE OF FAITH. WE'VE STOOD FOR THE SANCTITY OF LIFE WITHOUT APOLOGY. WE HAVE STOOD FOR THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY OF EVERY AMERICAN OF EVERY FAITH. AND BEYOND THAT, WE MADE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD STRONGER STILL. WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS PRESIDENT HAS APPOINTED MORE CONSERVATIVES TO OUR COURTS OF APPEALS THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND WE REVIVED THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN THREE SHORT YEARS. TRUE. IN THOSE FIRST THREE YEARS, PRESIDENT TRUMP KEPT PROMS HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. WE CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR WORKING FAMILIES AN BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL. THIS PRESIDENT ACTUALLY SIGN MASTER'S DEGREE BILLS CUTTING FEDERAL RED TAPE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE FOUGHT FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE. THE USMCA IS NOW THE LAW OF THE LAND. WE UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY. IN THOSE FIRST THREE YEARS, BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION GOOD-PAYING JOBS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND THEN THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC STRUCK. IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGING TIME. BEEN A CHALLENGING TIME. THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR. ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST , ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST FOUR WEEKS HERE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. BUT EARLY IN THIS PANDEMIC, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAW THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS PRESIDENT SHINE FORTH. PRESIDENT TRUMP MARSHALED NOT ONLY A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE BUT A WHOLE OF AMERICA RESPONSE. WE REINVENTED TESTING. WE STARTED DELIVERING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO THE EXTRAORDINARY HEALTH CARE WORKERS THAT HAVE SAVED LIVES ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING MEDICINES KNOWN AS THERAPEUTICS AT A RECORD PACE AND WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY TO HAVING THE FIRST CORONAVIRUS VACCINE, I BELIEVE BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR. NOW , WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO ON ALL FRONTS. YOU ALL KNOW THAT. WE ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY, TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE, TO SAVE LIVES. YOU KNOW OUR HEARTS ARE WITH THE MORE THAN 150,000 FAMILIES THAT HAVE LOST LOVED ONES IN THIS PANDEMIC. AND OUR GRATITUDE IS WITH ALL OF THE AMAZING FIRST RESPONDERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE DOCTORS AN NURSES AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN NOTHING LESS THAN HEROIC EVERY DAY OF THIS PANDEMIC. THEY HAVE OUR THANKS. BUT WE'RE ENCOURAGED, WE'RE ENCOURAGED BY THE PROGRESS THAT WE'RE MAKING. IN THE SUNSHINE STATE AND ALL ACROSS THE SUN BELT. BECAUSE OF THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP AND OUR ON FWOING EFFORT, BECAUSE OF THE STRONG LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS IN THIS CHALLENGING TIME. I GOT A REPORT FROM THE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE YESTERDAY THAT CASES ARE COMING DOWN IN THE SUNSHINE STATE. POSITIVE TESTS ARE COMING DOWN. AND OUR ECONOMY IS COMING BACK. IT'S AMAZING TO THINK AFTER LOSING 22 MILLION JOBS AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, BECAUSE OF THE SOLID FOUNDATION THAT OUR PRESIDENT POURED OF LESS TAXES, LESS REGULATION, MORE AMERICAN ENERGY, FREE AND FAIR TRADE IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS, THE AMERICAN COMEBACK HAS BEGUN AND WE'VE ALREADY ADDED EIGHT MILLION JOBS BACK TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. WE'RE OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN AND WE'RE OPENING UP AMERICAN SCHOOLS AGAIN. BUT I'LL MAKE YOU A PROMISE. I'LL MAKE YOU A PROM HERE IN THE A PROM HERE IN THE SUNSHINE STATE AND PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO I THINK IN THIS COMING ELECTION THE CHOICE WILL NOT BE WHETHER AMERICA WILL BE MORE CONSERVATIVE OR MORE LIBERAL, MORE REPUBLICAN OR MORE DEMOCRAT, MORE RED OR MORE BLUE. THE CHASE WE FACE IS WHETHER AMERICA REMAINS AMERICA. IT'S WHETHER WE WILL LEAVE TO OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN A COUNTRY GROUNDED IN OUR HIGHEST IDEALS OF FREEDOM, FREE MARKETS, THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO LIFE AND LIBERTY. OR WHETHER WE WILL LEAVE TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN A COUNTRY THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING ELSE. WE STAND AT A CROSSROADS OF FREEDOM. BEFORE US LIE TWO PATHS. ONE BASE ON THE DIGNITY AND WORTH OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL. AND THE OTHER ON THE GROWING CONTROL OF THE STATE. ONE ROAD LEADS TO GREATER FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY. THE OTHER ROAD LEADS TO SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. I KNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. , I KNOW THE MERP PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE FREEDOM AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN WE RE-ELECT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. [APPLAUSE] THE TRUTH IS, JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS WOULD SEND AMERICA ON A PATH OF SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. PRESIDENT TRUMP SET OUR NATION ON A PATH OF FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THAT IS THE CHOICE WE FACE. BETWEEN A SOCIETY GROUNDED IN FREEDOM AND ONE GROUNDED IN SOCIALISM. ONE GROUNDED IN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. OR DECLINE. IT'S AMAZING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR AGENDA. I MEAN, IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC, JOE BIDEN WOULD RAISE TAXES BY $1 TRILLION. TO CONTRAST, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP CUT TAXES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR TAX RELIEF FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. JOE BIDEN , JOE BIDEN WOULD BURY THIS ECONOMY UNDER AN AVALANCHE OF RED TAPE. MORE REGULATION. MORE BUREAUCRACY. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAS CUT MORE FEDERAL RED TAPE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. JOE BIDEN HAS A $2 TRILLION PLAN TO ABOLISH FOSSIL FUELS. HE'D REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. AND IMPLEMENT A.O.C.'S GREEN NEW DEAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP? HE'S PROCEEDED ON AN ALL OF THE ABOVE ENERGY STRATEGY AND MADE OUR NATION ENERGY INDEPENDENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 75 YEARS. WE'RE A NET EXPORTER OF ENERGY TO THE WORLD. IT'S NOT JUST THE CHOICE AT HOME. IT'S ON THE WORLD STAGE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT JOE BIDEN WAS A LEADING VOICE OF APPEASEMENT TOWARD IRAN. AND THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT US OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND SOLEIMANI IS GONE. [APPLAUSE] AND WE'RE , AND WHERE FOUR PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS MADE PROMISES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLY, IT WAS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHO KEPT HIS PROMISE. WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM. THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. SO THIS PRESIDENT HAS STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AND STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES. CLOSER TO HOME PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS STOOD FOR LAW AND ORDER EVERY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN ACTUALLY SAID HE BELIEVES THAT AMERICA IS SYSTEMICALLY RACIST. AND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS AN IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST MINORITIES. WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS ASKED WHETHER HE WOULD CUT FUNDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, HE SAID, AND I QUOTE, YES. ABSOLUTELY. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I KNOW THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT ON THE UNIFORM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT EVERY DAY ARE THE BEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. WITH THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE, WE WILL ALWAYS STAND WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE THIN BLUE LINE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEFUND THE POLICE, NOT NOW, NOT EVER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DESPITE WHAT JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT THINK, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT ISN'T THE PROBLEM. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THE SOLUTION. MEN AND WOMEN, WE DON'T NEED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SUPPORTING OUR MEN , OUR MINORITY COMMUNITIES. THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE BOTH EVERY SINGLE DAY AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER. WE WILL SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE WILL SUPPORT OUR MINORITY COMMUNITIES. WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] AND ON THE ISSUES IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE OF FAITH IN AMERICA, WHAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY, AMERICANS WHO CHERISH LIFE AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT ARE DEEPLY OUT OF STEP WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT SUPPORT ABORTION ON DEMAND. THEY SUPPORT TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION. EVEN THOUGH THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, JOE BIDEN SUPPORTED WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE HYDE AMENDMENT, WHICH PREVENTED TAXPAYER DOLLARS FROM GOING TO FUND ABORTION, THE PRESSURE FROM THE RADICAL LEFT, JOE BIDEN ABANDONED THAT POSITION. AND NOW PLEDGES TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO FUND ABORTION AT HOME AND ABROAD AND JOE BIDEN IS CALLING FOR HISTORIC INCREASES IN FUNDING TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF AMERICA. JOE BIDEN HAS ALSO PROMISED TO REIMPOSE OBAMACARE MANDATES ON RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS. FORTUNATELY THIS PRESIDENT ENDED THE ASSAULT ON THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR AND THE SUPREME COURT BY 7-2 ENDED IT FOREVER. WHILE JOE BIDEN IS ADVANCING A SOCIAL AGENDA OF THE RADICAL LEFT, BY CONTRAST, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAS STOOD FOR THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OF EVERY AMERICAN OF EVERY FAITH, EVERY DAY THAT WE'VE BEEN IN OFFICE. THANKS TO THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, I'M PROUD TO REPORT TO YOU THAT NOW WE HAVE MORE THAN 200 NEW JUDGES APPOINTED TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS AT EVERY LEVEL. AND THEY ARE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. LINE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION. THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FROM DAY ONE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, THIS PRESIDENT HAS STOOD FOR LIFE. LITERALLY, WE WERE IN OFFICE LESS THAN A WEEK WHEN THE PRESIDENT REINSTATED WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE MEXICO CITY POLICY WHICH WOULD ENSURE THAT NO TAXPAYER DOLLARS WOULD EVER BE USED TO PROVIDE OR PROMOTE ABORTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. THIS PRESIDENT ALSO RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO PEOPLE OF FAITH. WE KNOW THAT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH SHOULD NOT END AT THE FRONT DOOR OF YOUR CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE OR PLACE OF WORSHIP. HE STOPPED ENFORCING THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT AND FREED UP THE PULPITS OF THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] AND I MUST TELL YOU, ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT WAS SITTING IN THE CHAIR IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND BEING GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAST THE TIE-BREAKING VOTE TO ALLOW STATES ACROSS THE NATION TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SIGNED THE BILL. JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SUPPORT LATE-TERM ABORTION. DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE EVEN BLOCKED A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE MEDICAL CARE FOR CHILDREN THAT SURVIVED ABORTION. BY CONTRAST, THIS PRESIDENT HAS CONSISTENTLY DEFENDED THE SANCTITY OF LIFE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OUR ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE TO CALL ON THE CONGRESS TO OUTLAW LATE-TERM ABORTION ONCE AND FOR ALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. IN FACT THIS PAST JANUARY, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BECAME THE FIRST PRESIDENT EVER TO ADDRESS THE ANNUAL MARCH FOR LIFE ON THE NATIONAL MALL IN PERSON. WITH THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP , CONSCIENCE RIGHTS OF DOCTORS, NURSES, TEACHERS AND REALS YOU CHARITIES HAVE BEEN PRESERVED. FOR ALL HE'S DONE FOR LIFE AND REAL JUS LIBERTY. FOR ALL HE'S DONE FOR PEOPLE OF FAITH, OF EVERY FAITH, ACROSS AMERICA. WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHANTING ""FOUR MORE YEARS BRTS] VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: IT IS GAD TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU FOR THIS FAITH IN AMERICA RALLY. I LOVE MY DAUGHTER'S INTRODUCTION TODAY BUT SHE KNOWS THE ONE I PREFER IS A LITTLE BIT SHORTER. I'M A CHRISTIAN, A CONSERVATIVE AND A REPUBLICAN, IN THAT ORDER. [APPLAUSE] BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S SO HUMBLING FOR ME TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO A PRESIDENT WHO HAS BEEN SUCH A STEADFAST DEFENDER OF LIFE AND FAITH AND FREEDOM. LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH MY FAMILY PRESENT, SHE TALKED ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO, CAN I JUST SAY THANK YOU TO THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA FOR GIVING OUR FAMILY THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING YOU AS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT'S THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE. YOU KNOW, THE FOUNDATION OF AMERICA IS FREEDOM. BUT THE FOUNDATION OF FREEDOM IS FAITH. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW AS PRESIDENT JOHN ADAMS SAID SO LONG AGO, AND I QUOTE, OUR CONSTITUTION WAS DESIGNED ONLY FOR A MORAL AND RELIGIOUS PEOPLE. IT IS WHOLLY INADEQUATE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ANY OTHER. I HAVE TRAVELED ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. SOMETIMES WITH MY WIFE AT MY SIDE. AND AS CHARLOTTE SAID, SOMETIMES WITH OUR DAUGHTER ALONG. FOUR YEARS ON I'M MORE CONVINCED THAN EVER OF TWO THINGS. AMERICA IS A FREEDOM-LOVING NATION. AND THIS IS A NATION OF FAITH. PEOPLE ACROSS THIS , PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY KNOW HOW PRECIOUS FREEDOM IS. I SEE THE PASSION IN THIS ROOM, I SEE IT ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, ON STREET CORNERS AND CONVERSATIONS. FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA. BUT MEN AND WOMEN, WE'VE GOT A TOUGH FIGHT AHEAD OF US. BUT IT ONLY MEANS THE PRIZE IS GOING TO BE MORE GLORIOUS. I HOPE YOU'LL ALL SEE YOURSELVES AS PART OF A GREAT STORY. THE STORY OF PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT. IT'S A STORY OF RENEWING AMERICAN STRENGTH. STORY OF REATING JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY AMERICAN. IT'S A STORY OF RESILIENCE. THROUGH THE TRIAL OF THIS PAST YEAR, STORY OF LAW AND ORDER AND PROTECTING ALL THAT'S MADE THIS COUNTRY STRONG AND PROSPEROUS AND GOOD. BUT LIKE ALL GREAT STORIES, THE ENDING IS UP TO US. FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, WHAT REMAINS OF THIS ELECTION, ROUGHLY 90 DAYS, WE'VE ALL GOT TO DO OUR PART. WE'VE GOT TO GO TELL THE STORY. AND WE'VE GOT TO WRITE THE END OF THE STORY BY RE-ELECTING PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. I HAVE FAITH. I KNOW THAT YOU WILL DO. BECAUSE THIS IS A FREEDOM-LOVING NATION. THE LOVE OF FREEDOM BEATS IN THE HEART OF EVERY AMERICAN. I KNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL MAKE THE CHOICE FOR FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY. THEY'RE GOING TO REJECT SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. A STUDY OF THE LONG AND STORIED HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY TEACHES THAT EVERY TIME, EVERY TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN MORE FREEDOM AND LESS FREEDOM, THEY STAND FOR FREEDOM, THEY FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, AND THEY CHOOSE FREEDOM EVERY SINGLE TIME. AND I KNOW YOU WILL AGAIN. I KNOW WE'LL RISE TO THE OCCASION. WE'LL RETURN PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TODAY. I REALLY DO. THIS IS , I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT IT MEANS TO SEE YOU ALL. AND TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT ON THE STREETS. THAT GREETED US. [APPLAUSE] WE GOT A GREAT FLORIDA WELCOME. I WANT YOU TO BRING YOUR DETERMINATION. I WANT YOU TO BRING YOUR VOICE. I WANT YOU TO REACH OUT TO YOUR NEIGHBORS AN FRIENDS. AT WOFFER SHIP AND AT WORK. SEND OUT AN EMAIL. TWEET, INSTAGRAM. LET PEOPLE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS ELECTION IS. AND LASTLY, IF YOU'RE INCLINED FROM TIME TO TIME TO BOW THE HEAD AND BEND THE KNEE I'D ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT TOO. YOU KNOW , YOU KNOW, THE SWEETEST WORDS THAT WE EVER HEAR AS WE TRAVEL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ARE WHEN PEOPLE WILL REACH OUT AND SAY I'M PRAYING FOR YOU. YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE MEAN IT. YOU CAN FEEL IT. EVERY SINGLE DAY I HAVE A BRIEFING BOOK AND MY STAFF ALL THE WAY BACK FROM MY DAYS IN CONGRESS, I'M SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN READ YOUR MAIL. SO MY STAFF ALWAYS SCOOPS OUT SOME MAIL AND PUTS IT IN MY BRIEFING BOOK EVERY DAY. ALMOST WITHOUT FAIL, LETTERS END WITH PEOPLE TELLING ME, PRAYING FOR YOU, PRAYING FOR THE PRESIDENT. AND IF YOU'RE AMONG THEM, I WANT TO TELL YOU, WE FEEL THOSE PRAYERS. KEEP IT UP. IT MATTERS. BUT ON THIS ONE, IN THESE DIVIDED TIME, WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE THAT DIVIDES US IN THIS COUNTRY THAN UNITES US, I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU, NOT SO MUCH TO PRAY FOR A CANDIDATE OR CAUSE, PRAY FOR AMERICA. PRAY FOR ALL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IN THIS ONE NATION UNDER GOD. WITH LIBERTY AN JUSTICE FOR ALL. AND WE WILL HEAL OUR LAND. WE WILL HEAL OUR LAND. FROM THAT WELLSPRING OF STRENGTH ON WHICH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS DRAWN. FROM FAITH IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THE BIBLE SAYS WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS, THERE'S FREEDOM. THAT MEANS WHEN WE STAND FOR FREE DOM, WHEN WE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, WE MAKE HIS CAUSE ON THIS EARTH OUR VERY OWN. AND IT ALSO MEANS FREEDOM ALWAYS WINS. SO THAT'S THE CHOICE WE FACE, MY FELLOW AMERICANS. BETWEEN FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY VERSUS SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IF ALL OF US DO ALL WE NEED TO DO BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY, EVEN IN THESE CHALLENGING DAYS, WE'LL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH. WE'LL HELP OUR NEIGHBORS AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO HEAL OUR LAND. AND COME NOVEMBER 3, WE'RE GOING TO WIN A GREAT VICTORY. FOR FREEDOM AND OUR WAY OF LIFE. WE'RE GOING TO ELECT AND RE-ELECT PRINCIPLED CONSERVATIVES AT EVERY LEVEL FROM THE CONGRESS TO THE STATE HOUSE. AND WHEN WE RE-ELECT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.

BUT IT'S SO GOOD TO BE WITH SO MANY FRIENDS FOR SO MANY YEARS. CONGRESSMAN BILIRAKIS AND I SERVED TOGETHER ON CAPITOL HILL. I WAS IN CONGRESS FOR 12 YEARS, ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED LONGER. CONGRESSMAN, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, YOU HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION OF CONSERVATIVE VALUES EVERY DAY YOU SERVE FLORIDA IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND I'M PROUD. I'M PROUD TO CALL YOU A FRIEND. AND SPEAKING OF FRIENDS, ALLOW ME TO BRING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE. MAN WHO LOVES THE SUNSHINE STATE. AND WHEN I TOLD HIM LAST NIGHT I WAS HEADED DOWN TO FLORIDA, I THINK HE SOUNDED JUST A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS. SO ALLOW ME TO BRING GREETINGS AND GRATITUDE AT THIS FAITH IN AMERICA RALLY FROM THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP! WELL, THANK YOU FOR THAT, EVERYBODY. IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU BUT I'M HERE AND HERE FOR ONE REASON ONLY. THAT'S BECAUSE FLORIDA AND AMERICA NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IT REALLY IS AMAZING WHEN YOU THINK OF THE LAST 3 1/2 YEARS. IT'S BEEN 3 1/2 YEARS OF ACTION. 3 1/2 YEARS OF RESULTS. IT'S BEEN 3 1/2 YEARS OF PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT. I MEAN, FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS KEPT THE PROMISES THAT HE'S MADE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. TO THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. AND ESPECIALLY TO PEOPLE OF FAITH. WE'VE STOOD FOR THE SANCTITY OF LIFE WITHOUT APOLOGY. WE HAVE STOOD FOR THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY OF EVERY AMERICAN OF EVERY FAITH. AND BEYOND THAT, WE MADE THE STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD STRONGER STILL. WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. THIS PRESIDENT HAS APPOINTED MORE CONSERVATIVES TO OUR COURTS OF APPEALS THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND WE REVIVED THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN THREE SHORT YEARS. TRUE. IN THOSE FIRST THREE YEARS, PRESIDENT TRUMP KEPT PROMS HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. WE CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR WORKING FAMILIES AN BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL. THIS PRESIDENT ACTUALLY SIGN MASTER'S DEGREE BILLS CUTTING FEDERAL RED TAPE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE FOUGHT FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE. THE USMCA IS NOW THE LAW OF THE LAND. WE UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY. IN THOSE FIRST THREE YEARS, BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION GOOD-PAYING JOBS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND THEN THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC STRUCK. IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGING TIME. BEEN A CHALLENGING TIME. THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR. ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST , ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST FOUR WEEKS HERE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. BUT EARLY IN THIS PANDEMIC, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAW THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS PRESIDENT SHINE FORTH. PRESIDENT TRUMP MARSHALED NOT ONLY A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE BUT A WHOLE OF AMERICA RESPONSE. WE REINVENTED TESTING. WE STARTED DELIVERING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO THE EXTRAORDINARY HEALTH CARE WORKERS THAT HAVE SAVED LIVES ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING MEDICINES KNOWN AS THERAPEUTICS AT A RECORD PACE AND WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY TO HAVING THE FIRST CORONAVIRUS VACCINE, I BELIEVE BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR. NOW , WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO ON ALL FRONTS. YOU ALL KNOW THAT. WE ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY, TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE, TO SAVE LIVES. YOU KNOW OUR HEARTS ARE WITH THE MORE THAN 150,000 FAMILIES THAT HAVE LOST LOVED ONES IN THIS PANDEMIC. AND OUR GRATITUDE IS WITH ALL OF THE AMAZING FIRST RESPONDERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE DOCTORS AN NURSES AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN NOTHING LESS THAN HEROIC EVERY DAY OF THIS PANDEMIC. THEY HAVE OUR THANKS. BUT WE'RE ENCOURAGED, WE'RE ENCOURAGED BY THE PROGRESS THAT WE'RE MAKING. IN THE SUNSHINE STATE AND ALL ACROSS THE SUN BELT. BECAUSE OF THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP AND OUR ON FWOING EFFORT, BECAUSE OF THE STRONG LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS IN THIS CHALLENGING TIME. I GOT A REPORT FROM THE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE YESTERDAY THAT CASES ARE COMING DOWN IN THE SUNSHINE STATE. POSITIVE TESTS ARE COMING DOWN. AND OUR ECONOMY IS COMING BACK. IT'S AMAZING TO THINK AFTER LOSING 22 MILLION JOBS AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, BECAUSE OF THE SOLID FOUNDATION THAT OUR PRESIDENT POURED OF LESS TAXES, LESS REGULATION, MORE AMERICAN ENERGY, FREE AND FAIR TRADE IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS, THE AMERICAN COMEBACK HAS BEGUN AND WE'VE ALREADY ADDED EIGHT MILLION JOBS BACK TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. WE'RE OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN AND WE'RE OPENING UP AMERICAN SCHOOLS AGAIN. BUT I'LL MAKE YOU A PROMISE. I'LL MAKE YOU A PROM HERE IN THE A PROM HERE IN THE SUNSHINE STATE AND PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO I THINK IN THIS COMING ELECTION THE CHOICE WILL NOT BE WHETHER AMERICA WILL BE MORE CONSERVATIVE OR MORE LIBERAL, MORE REPUBLICAN OR MORE DEMOCRAT, MORE RED OR MORE BLUE. THE CHASE WE FACE IS WHETHER AMERICA REMAINS AMERICA. IT'S WHETHER WE WILL LEAVE TO OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN A COUNTRY GROUNDED IN OUR HIGHEST IDEALS OF FREEDOM, FREE MARKETS, THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO LIFE AND LIBERTY. OR WHETHER WE WILL LEAVE TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN A COUNTRY THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING ELSE. WE STAND AT A CROSSROADS OF FREEDOM. BEFORE US LIE TWO PATHS. ONE BASE ON THE DIGNITY AND WORTH OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL. AND THE OTHER ON THE GROWING CONTROL OF THE STATE. ONE ROAD LEADS TO GREATER FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY. THE OTHER ROAD LEADS TO SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. I KNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. , I KNOW THE MERP PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE FREEDOM AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN WE RE-ELECT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. THE TRUTH IS, JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS WOULD SEND AMERICA ON A PATH OF SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. PRESIDENT TRUMP SET OUR NATION ON A PATH OF FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THAT IS THE CHOICE WE FACE. BETWEEN A SOCIETY GROUNDED IN FREEDOM AND ONE GROUNDED IN SOCIALISM. ONE GROUNDED IN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. OR DECLINE. IT'S AMAZING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR AGENDA. I MEAN, IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC, JOE BIDEN WOULD RAISE TAXES BY $1 TRILLION. TO CONTRAST, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP CUT TAXES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR TAX RELIEF FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. JOE BIDEN , JOE BIDEN WOULD BURY THIS ECONOMY UNDER AN AVALANCHE OF RED TAPE. MORE REGULATION. MORE BUREAUCRACY. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAS CUT MORE FEDERAL RED TAPE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. JOE BIDEN HAS A $2 TRILLION PLAN TO ABOLISH FOSSIL FUELS. HE'D REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. AND IMPLEMENT A.O.C.'S GREEN NEW DEAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP? HE'S PROCEEDED ON AN ALL OF THE ABOVE ENERGY STRATEGY AND MADE OUR NATION ENERGY INDEPENDENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 75 YEARS. WE'RE A NET EXPORTER OF ENERGY TO THE WORLD. IT'S NOT JUST THE CHOICE AT HOME. IT'S ON THE WORLD STAGE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT JOE BIDEN WAS A LEADING VOICE OF APPEASEMENT TOWARD IRAN. AND THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT US OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND SOLEIMANI IS GONE. AND WE'RE , AND WHERE FOUR PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS MADE PROMISES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLY, IT WAS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHO KEPT HIS PROMISE. WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM. THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. SO THIS PRESIDENT HAS STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AND STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES. CLOSER TO HOME PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS STOOD FOR LAW AND ORDER EVERY SINGLE DAY. JOE BIDEN ACTUALLY SAID HE BELIEVES THAT AMERICA IS SYSTEMICALLY RACIST. AND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS AN IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST MINORITIES. WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS ASKED WHETHER HE WOULD CUT FUNDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, HE SAID, AND I QUOTE, YES. ABSOLUTELY. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I KNOW THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT ON THE UNIFORM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT EVERY DAY ARE THE BEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. WITH THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE, WE WILL ALWAYS STAND WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE THIN BLUE LINE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEFUND THE POLICE, NOT NOW, NOT EVER. DESPITE WHAT JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT THINK, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT ISN'T THE PROBLEM. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THE SOLUTION. MEN AND WOMEN, WE DON'T NEED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SUPPORTING OUR MEN , OUR MINORITY COMMUNITIES. THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE BOTH EVERY SINGLE DAY AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER. WE WILL SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE WILL SUPPORT OUR MINORITY COMMUNITIES. WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. AND ON THE ISSUES IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE OF FAITH IN AMERICA, WHAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY, AMERICANS WHO CHERISH LIFE AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT ARE DEEPLY OUT OF STEP WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT SUPPORT ABORTION ON DEMAND. THEY SUPPORT TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION. EVEN THOUGH THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, JOE BIDEN SUPPORTED WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE HYDE AMENDMENT, WHICH PREVENTED TAXPAYER DOLLARS FROM GOING TO FUND ABORTION, THE PRESSURE FROM THE RADICAL LEFT, JOE BIDEN ABANDONED THAT POSITION. AND NOW PLEDGES TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO FUND ABORTION AT HOME AND ABROAD AND JOE BIDEN IS CALLING FOR HISTORIC INCREASES IN FUNDING TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF AMERICA. JOE BIDEN HAS ALSO PROMISED TO REIMPOSE OBAMACARE MANDATES ON RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS. FORTUNATELY THIS PRESIDENT ENDED THE ASSAULT ON THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR AND THE SUPREME COURT BY 7-2 ENDED IT FOREVER. WHILE JOE BIDEN IS ADVANCING A SOCIAL AGENDA OF THE RADICAL LEFT, BY CONTRAST, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAS STOOD FOR THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OF EVERY AMERICAN OF EVERY FAITH, EVERY DAY THAT WE'VE BEEN IN OFFICE. THANKS TO THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, I'M PROUD TO REPORT TO YOU THAT NOW WE HAVE MORE THAN 200 NEW JUDGES APPOINTED TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS AT EVERY LEVEL. AND THEY ARE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. LINE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION. THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. FROM DAY ONE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, THIS PRESIDENT HAS STOOD FOR LIFE. LITERALLY, WE WERE IN OFFICE LESS THAN A WEEK WHEN THE PRESIDENT REINSTATED WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE MEXICO CITY POLICY WHICH WOULD ENSURE THAT NO TAXPAYER DOLLARS WOULD EVER BE USED TO PROVIDE OR PROMOTE ABORTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. THIS PRESIDENT ALSO RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO PEOPLE OF FAITH. WE KNOW THAT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH SHOULD NOT END AT THE FRONT DOOR OF YOUR CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE OR PLACE OF WORSHIP. HE STOPPED ENFORCING THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT AND FREED UP THE PULPITS OF THIS NATION. AND I MUST TELL YOU, ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT WAS SITTING IN THE CHAIR IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND BEING GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAST THE TIE-BREAKING VOTE TO ALLOW STATES ACROSS THE NATION TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SIGNED THE BILL. JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SUPPORT LATE-TERM ABORTION. DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE EVEN BLOCKED A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE MEDICAL CARE FOR CHILDREN THAT SURVIVED ABORTION. BY CONTRAST, THIS PRESIDENT HAS CONSISTENTLY DEFENDED THE SANCTITY OF LIFE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OUR ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE TO CALL ON THE CONGRESS TO OUTLAW LATE-TERM ABORTION ONCE AND FOR ALL. AND WE STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. IN FACT THIS PAST JANUARY, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BECAME THE FIRST PRESIDENT EVER TO ADDRESS THE ANNUAL MARCH FOR LIFE ON THE NATIONAL MALL IN PERSON. WITH THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP , CONSCIENCE RIGHTS OF DOCTORS, NURSES, TEACHERS AND REALS YOU CHARITIES HAVE BEEN PRESERVED. FOR ALL HE'S DONE FOR LIFE AND REAL JUS LIBERTY. FOR ALL HE'S DONE FOR PEOPLE OF FAITH, OF EVERY FAITH, ACROSS AMERICA. WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IT IS GAD TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU FOR THIS FAITH IN AMERICA RALLY. I LOVE MY DAUGHTER'S INTRODUCTION TODAY BUT SHE KNOWS THE ONE I PREFER IS A LITTLE BIT SHORTER. I'M A CHRISTIAN, A CONSERVATIVE AND A REPUBLICAN, IN THAT ORDER. BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S SO HUMBLING FOR ME TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO A PRESIDENT WHO HAS BEEN SUCH A STEADFAST DEFENDER OF LIFE AND FAITH AND FREEDOM. LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH MY FAMILY PRESENT, SHE TALKED ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO, CAN I JUST SAY THANK YOU TO THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA FOR GIVING OUR FAMILY THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING YOU AS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT'S THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE. YOU KNOW, THE FOUNDATION OF AMERICA IS FREEDOM. BUT THE FOUNDATION OF FREEDOM IS FAITH. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW AS PRESIDENT JOHN ADAMS SAID SO LONG AGO, AND I QUOTE, OUR CONSTITUTION WAS DESIGNED ONLY FOR A MORAL AND RELIGIOUS PEOPLE. IT IS WHOLLY INADEQUATE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ANY OTHER. I HAVE TRAVELED ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. SOMETIMES WITH MY WIFE AT MY SIDE. AND AS CHARLOTTE SAID, SOMETIMES WITH OUR DAUGHTER ALONG. FOUR YEARS ON I'M MORE CONVINCED THAN EVER OF TWO THINGS. AMERICA IS A FREEDOM-LOVING NATION. AND THIS IS A NATION OF FAITH. PEOPLE ACROSS THIS , PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY KNOW HOW PRECIOUS FREEDOM IS. I SEE THE PASSION IN THIS ROOM, I SEE IT ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, ON STREET CORNERS AND CONVERSATIONS. FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA. BUT MEN AND WOMEN, WE'VE GOT A TOUGH FIGHT AHEAD OF US. BUT IT ONLY MEANS THE PRIZE IS GOING TO BE MORE GLORIOUS. I HOPE YOU'LL ALL SEE YOURSELVES AS PART OF A GREAT STORY. THE STORY OF PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT. IT'S A STORY OF RENEWING AMERICAN STRENGTH. STORY OF REATING JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY AMERICAN. IT'S A STORY OF RESILIENCE. THROUGH THE TRIAL OF THIS PAST YEAR, STORY OF LAW AND ORDER AND PROTECTING ALL THAT'S MADE THIS COUNTRY STRONG AND PROSPEROUS AND GOOD. BUT LIKE ALL GREAT STORIES, THE ENDING IS UP TO US. FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, WHAT REMAINS OF THIS ELECTION, ROUGHLY 90 DAYS, WE'VE ALL GOT TO DO OUR PART. WE'VE GOT TO GO TELL THE STORY. AND WE'VE GOT TO WRITE THE END OF THE STORY BY RE-ELECTING PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. I HAVE FAITH. I KNOW THAT YOU WILL DO. BECAUSE THIS IS A FREEDOM-LOVING NATION. THE LOVE OF FREEDOM BEATS IN THE HEART OF EVERY AMERICAN. I KNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL MAKE THE CHOICE FOR FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY. THEY'RE GOING TO REJECT SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. A STUDY OF THE LONG AND STORIED HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY TEACHES THAT EVERY TIME, EVERY TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN MORE FREEDOM AND LESS FREEDOM, THEY STAND FOR FREEDOM, THEY FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, AND THEY CHOOSE FREEDOM EVERY SINGLE TIME. AND I KNOW YOU WILL AGAIN. I KNOW WE'LL RISE TO THE OCCASION. WE'LL RETURN PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TODAY. I REALLY DO. THIS IS , I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT IT MEANS TO SEE YOU ALL. AND TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT ON THE STREETS. THAT GREETED US. WE GOT A GREAT FLORIDA WELCOME. I WANT YOU TO BRING YOUR DETERMINATION. I WANT YOU TO BRING YOUR VOICE. I WANT YOU TO REACH OUT TO YOUR NEIGHBORS AN FRIENDS. AT WOFFER SHIP AND AT WORK. SEND OUT AN EMAIL. TWEET, INSTAGRAM. LET PEOPLE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS ELECTION IS. AND LASTLY, IF YOU'RE INCLINED FROM TIME TO TIME TO BOW THE HEAD AND BEND THE KNEE I'D ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT TOO. YOU KNOW , YOU KNOW, THE SWEETEST WORDS THAT WE EVER HEAR AS WE TRAVEL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ARE WHEN PEOPLE WILL REACH OUT AND SAY I'M PRAYING FOR YOU. YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE MEAN IT. YOU CAN FEEL IT. EVERY SINGLE DAY I HAVE A BRIEFING BOOK AND MY STAFF ALL THE WAY BACK FROM MY DAYS IN CONGRESS, I'M SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN READ YOUR MAIL. SO MY STAFF ALWAYS SCOOPS OUT SOME MAIL AND PUTS IT IN MY BRIEFING BOOK EVERY DAY. ALMOST WITHOUT FAIL, LETTERS END WITH PEOPLE TELLING ME, PRAYING FOR YOU, PRAYING FOR THE PRESIDENT. AND IF YOU'RE AMONG THEM, I WANT TO TELL YOU, WE FEEL THOSE PRAYERS. KEEP IT UP. IT MATTERS. BUT ON THIS ONE, IN THESE DIVIDED TIME, WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE THAT DIVIDES US IN THIS COUNTRY THAN UNITES US, I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU, NOT SO MUCH TO PRAY FOR A CANDIDATE OR CAUSE, PRAY FOR AMERICA. PRAY FOR ALL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IN THIS ONE NATION UNDER GOD. WITH LIBERTY AN JUSTICE FOR ALL. AND WE WILL HEAL OUR LAND. WE WILL HEAL OUR LAND. FROM THAT WELLSPRING OF STRENGTH ON WHICH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS DRAWN. FROM FAITH IN AMERICA. THE BIBLE SAYS WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS, THERE'S FREEDOM. THAT MEANS WHEN WE STAND FOR FREE DOM, WHEN WE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, WE MAKE HIS CAUSE ON THIS EARTH OUR VERY OWN. AND IT ALSO MEANS FREEDOM ALWAYS WINS. SO THAT'S THE CHOICE WE FACE, MY FELLOW AMERICANS. BETWEEN FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY VERSUS SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IF ALL OF US DO ALL WE NEED TO DO BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY, EVEN IN THESE CHALLENGING DAYS, WE'LL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH. WE'LL HELP OUR NEIGHBORS AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO HEAL OUR LAND. AND COME NOVEMBER 3, WE'RE GOING TO WIN A GREAT VICTORY. FOR FREEDOM AND OUR WAY OF LIFE. WE'RE GOING TO ELECT AND RE-ELECT PRINCIPLED CONSERVATIVES AT EVERY LEVEL FROM THE CONGRESS TO THE STATE HOUSE. AND WHEN WE RE-ELECT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?474380-1/vice-president-pence-campaign-stop-clearwater-florida	Vice President Pence delivered remarks to a group gathered in Clearwater, Florida. It was part of a multi-stop Sunshine State campaign trip focused on reaching evangelical and &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; voters. The vice president was introduced by his daughter, Charlotte Pence Bond. His remarks largely contrasted himself and President Trump with Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, on such issues as abortion, religious freedom, and health care policy.

MY FRIEND MARILYN MUSGRAVES, DEPUTY SECRETARY ERIC HARDEN, TO STATE REPRESENTATIVE AND FUTURE SPEAKER OF THE FLORIDA STATE HOUSE, CHRIS SPRAWLS. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] AND THE PASTOR STIFF ANY PARKER HERE AT STARKEY BAPTIST CHURCH. IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN CHURCH AND GREAT TO BE AMONG SO MANY CHAMPIONS FOR LIFE. [APPLAUSE] AND IT'S A JOY TO BE HERE WITH THE SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST, FOUNDED IN 1993. NOW A NETWORK OF MORE THAN 800,000 AMERICANS, SBA IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE PRO-LIFE GRASS ROOTS ORGANIZATION IN AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT TO ALL THE GREAT FRIENDS WHO HAVE COME OUT TODAY, WHO HAVE LABORED IN THE CAUSE OF LIFE ALL ACROSS THE SUNSHINE STATE, I JUST FIRST AND FOREMOST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR LIFE. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE GREAT MOVEMENT, THE SANCTITY OF LIFE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE UNBORN. IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE AMONG FRIENDS. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] AND SPEAKING OF FRIENDS OF MINE, ALLOW ME TO BEGIN BY BRINGING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE. A MAN WHO LOVES THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND A MAN WHO IS THE MOST PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. I BRING GREETINGS FROM THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REALLY, IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY AS WE APPROACH A TIME FOR CHOOSING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BUT AS WE GATHER TODAY, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE HERE IN FLORIDA THAT WE'RE ALSO LIVING IN A TIME OF TESTING. HERE IN FLORIDA AND ALL ACROSS AMERICA WE HAVE FACED CHALLENGES IN THE MIDST OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC LIKE MANY OF US HAVE NEVER SEEN IN OUR LIFETIME. AND I MUST TELL YOU, I'M PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE OF A PRESIDENT WHO HAS PUT THE HEALTH OF AMERICA FIRST FROM DAY ONE AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS ALL ACROSS THE STATE OF FLORIDA. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] AS I HEARD YESTERDAY, AS THE WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE MEETING, BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE, LIVE IS WINNING IN AMERICA. THE POLICY MAKING SURE NO TAXPAYER DOLLARS WOULD GO TO PROMOTE OR PROVIDE EYE BORINGS AROUND THE WORLD AND THEN HE EXPANDED IT A YEAR LATER. [APPLAUSE]. PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAME THE FIRST IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO ADDRESS THE MARCH FOR LIFE IN PERSON ON THE NATIONAL MALL. IN OUR FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE, THE PRESIDENT TOOK ACTION TO END THE ASSAULT ON THE CONSCIENCE RIGHTS OF A GROUP OF NUNS, KNOWN AS THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR AND WE APPOINTED JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT WHO WERE A PART OF A 7-2 MAJORITY THAT ENDED THE ASSAULT ON THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE PARENTHOOD AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SIGNED IT INTO LAW. BY CONTRAST, JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ABORTIONS. AND JOE BIDEN WOULD APPOINT COURTS WHO WOULD LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH AND TRAMPLE OUR LIBERTY. NOW MORE THAN EVER PRO-LIFE AMERICANS NEED TO LET OUR VOICE BE HEARD AND STAND FOR LIFE. [APPLAUSE] IN CITIES AND STATES, YOU NEED TO SPEAK OUT AND BECOME INVOLVED. THE SBA IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT SPANS THE ENTIRE AREA. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE RADICAL LEFT WANTS TO SILENCE, A STUDENT FOR LIFE, A GROUP OF STUDENTS WERE WRITING BLACK PRE-BORN LIVES MATTER OUTSIDE OF A PLANNED PARENTHOOD. THE RADICAL LEFT SUPPORTS ABORTION, BUT WOULD PROSECUTE THOSE WHO STAND FOR LIFE. WE'VE EVEN SEEN DEMOCRAT-LED LEGISLATORS IN THIS COUNTRY STAND UP AND CHEER WITH THE PASSAGE OF BILLS THAT PROVIDE FOR LATE TERM ABORTION. ONE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR ACTUALLY OPENLY SUPPORTED INFANTICIDE. THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR AND I WANT TO MAKE YOU A PROMISE. THIS PRESIDENT, THIS VICE-PRESIDENT, AND THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL ALWAYS STAND UP FOR THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH OF EVERY AMERICAN AND WE WILL ALWAYS STAND FOR LIFE. [APPLAUSE] THE BIBLE ADMONISHES US, AND I QUOTE SPEAK UP FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. SO THE PEOPLE IN THIS MOVEMENT HAVE DONE EVERY DAY SINCE THAT DAY 47 YEARS AGO, BECAUSE YOU'VE SPOKEN UP. BECAUSE YOU STOOD UP. BECAUSE YOU'VE STOOD FOR THOSE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE, FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO THE COURTHOUSES, U.S. SENATE AND CONSERVATIVE LEGISLATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THE WORK OF SBA, IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS AND I THINK THAT LIFE IS WINNING BECAUSE OF THE ACTTIVISKM AND BECAUSE FRTOF THE PASSION AND LIFE AND WOMEN INCRISIS FOR DECADES. THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT IS DEFINED BY GENEROSITY, COMPASSION AND LOVE FOR WOMEN AND UNBORN CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] AND YOU NEED LOOK NO FURTHER THAN MINISTRIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS AND CARE CENTERS, MINISTERING TO NEEDS OF WOMEN IN CRISIS. IT'S TRULY INSPIRING. I STOPPED BY ONE ON MY WAY HERE IN FLORIDA, A CLINIC CALLED THE WOMEN'S PLACE. THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT DOESN'T JUST TALK THE TALK, YOU WALK THE WALK AND I SAW A WONDERFUL CLINIC. HEARD ABOUT ALL THE VOLUNTEERS THAT WERE WITH REGISTERED NURSES, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, BUSTLING EVERY DAY WITH PEOPLE NOT JUST STAND FOR LIFE, BUT STAND WITH WOMEN FACING THE MOST DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES IN THEIR LIVES. A WOMAN'S PLACE, I LEARNED, IS PART OF NEW LIFE SOLUTIONS. THE MINISTRY THAT'S BEEN HERE IN PINELLAS AND HILLSBORO COUNTIES FOR YEARS, AND THEIR COMPASSIONATE WORK HAS SAVED 10,000 BABY'S LIVES. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] AND I LIKE GIVING CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE. WOULD YOU ALL MIND JOINING ME IN THANKING BOARD CHAIRMAN, KATHY ARRINGTON AND THE NEW LIFE SOLUTIONS TEAM THAT ARE HERE? WOULD YOU STAND, KATHY, AND THE NEW LIFE SOLUTIONS TEAM? LET'S SHOW THEM HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE THE WAY THEY PUT THIS ON EVERY DAY. [APPLAUSE] WHAT A GREAT GROUP. THANKS TO YOUR COMMITMENT FOR 35 YEARS IN THIS COMMUNITY AND IN CITIES AND TOWNS ALL ACROSS AMERICA. I'M PROUD TO REPORT TO YOU THAT THERE ARE FAR MORE PREGNANCY CARE CENTERS IN AMERICA THAN ABORTION CLINICS. THAT IS PROGRESS. [APPLAUSE] AND LIFE IS WINNING IN AMERICA BECAUSE OF ALL OF YOU. IN FACT, I SAW THAT WORK FIRSTHAND TODAY. WE HAD A FEW MINUTES TO MEET A WOMAN WHOSE LIFE WAS CHANGED WHEN SHE VISITED. WHEN SHE VISITED A WOMAN'S PLACE. KIA TOLD ME SHE WAS 40 YEARS OLD, PREGNANT AND SINGLE TO BECOME A MOTHER AGAIN. SHE PICKED UP THE PHONE, SHE SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD. BEFORE SHE WENT, SHE SAID SHE HEARD ABOUT A CLINIC THAT OFFERED FREE SONOGRAMS. SO SHE WENT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THAT LITTLE ROOM WHERE I WAS JUST STANDING, SHE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HER LITTLE BOY. AND KIA CHOSE LIFE. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE]. SHE SAID, AND I QUOTE, FROM THE MOMENT THAT I SAW HIM, I INTO YOU I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE. SHE SAID, IF I HADN'T FOUND A WOMAN'S PLACE AND THE WONDERFUL WOMEN THERE, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENT CHOICE. AND I MET LITTLE OLLIE TODAY. HE WAS A HEALTHY AND EXUBERANT LITTLE BOY WHO WILL TURN ONE YEAR OLD NEXT WEEK. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THIS MOVEMENT HAS MADE. ONE LIFE AT A TIME. ONE FAMILY AT A TIME. AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THE SBA LIST MAKES. THE DIFFERENCE EVERYONE WORKING IN THIS MOVEMENT HAS MADE IN THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND I JUST REALLY WANTED TO COME BY TO SAY THANK YOU AND TO URGE YOU ON. LIFE IS WINNING IN AMERICA. I TRULY DO BELIEVE, BECAUSE OF THAT COMPASSION, THAT CARE AND THAT LOVE. THERE MAY HAVE BEEN THOSE IN 1973 THAT THOUGHT THAT THIS MOVEMENT WOULD SOME DAY FADE OUT. BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CHERISH ALL OF OUR GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CHERISH THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND WE WILL STAND IN THIS MOVEMENT UNTIL WE RESTORE THE RIGHT TO LIFE, TO THE CENTER OF AMERICAN LAW. I BELIEVE IT. [APPLAUSE] SO FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO THE COURTHOUSE, CARE CENTERS, LIFE IS WINNING IN AMERICA, BUT I, IT'S WINNING IN ONE OTHER WAY THAT IS WORTH REMEMBERING. I THINK LIFE IS WINNING HEARTS AND MINDS IN THE RISING GENERATION GENERATION. YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY ARE RIGHTLY SEEN BY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS ON OUR NATIONAL MALL AS A NEW PRO-LIFE GENERATION AND SO THEY ARE. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] THE RISING GENERATION MORE PRO-LIFE THAN BEFORE. MORE AMERICANS ARE EMBRACING THE SANCTITY OF LIFE IN RECORD NUMBERS MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY BECAUSE THEY'VE HEARD THE MESSAGE, THEY'VE HEARD FROM LEADERS IN PULPITS AND IN PUBLIC OFFICES AROUND THE COUNTRY. I THINK THEY'VE ALSO BEEN MOVED. THEY'VE BEEN MOVED BY THE COMPASSION THAT THEY'VE SEEN IN PLACES LIKE A WOMAN'S PLACE. BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT LIFE IS WINNING IN THE RISING GENERATION BECAUSE OF THE QUIET COUNSELS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE BETWEEN MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS. BETWEEN GRANDMOTHERS AND GRANDDAUGHTERS. I THINK THE TRUTH ABOUT ABORTION IS BEING TOLD. AND THIS NEW GENERATION IS CHOOSING LIFE. AS ONE PRO-LIFE ADVOCATE RECENTLY WROTE IN HER COLUMNS IN THE WASHINGTON TIMES AND I QUOTE, IF OUR GENERATION IS TO BE CONCERNED WITH THE DISENFRANCHISED, THE MARGINALIZED, WITH THE OPPRESSED AND THE OUTSIDER, THE UNBORN CHILD FITS ALL OF THESE DESCRIPTIONS. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] THAT IS A VOICE IN THE RISING GENERATION AND ALSO THE VOICE OF MY DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE. CHARLOTTE PENCE BOND, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF YOUR STAND FOR LIFE IN THIS RISING GENERATION. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] SO LIFE IS WINNING IN AMERICA. AND AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK AS A NATION TO EMERGE FROM THE HEARTBREAKING DAYS FROM WHICH WE HAVE PASSED, DAYS THAT HAVE SEEN MORE THAN 150,000 FAMILIES SUFFER LOSS, AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK EVERY DAY, BRING OUR NATION THROUGH THIS TIME OF TESTING TESTING, WE ARE COMING TO A TIME FOR CHOOSING. AND IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR LIFE. TO KEEP CARING, TO KEEP REACHING OUT WITH COMPASSION AND TO KEEP STANDING WITH ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT STAND FOR LIFE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID NOT LONG AGO, QUOTE, EVERY PERSON IS WORTH PROTECTING, EVERY HUMAN SOUL IS DIVINE AND EVERY HUMAN LIFE BORN AND UNBORN IS MADE IN THE HOLY IMAGE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] AND I PROMISE YOU THIS PRESIDENT AND I WILL STAND FOR LIFE. STAND WITH WOMEN IN CRISIS PREGNANCY AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISES THAT WE MADE. NOT JUST TO THE PEOPLE OF A MOVEMENT OR A CAUSE, BUT TO THE HIGHEST IDEALS OF OUR NATION, INCLUDING THE UNALIENABLE RIGHT TO LIFE. AND IN THE DAYS AHEAD, AS YOU LABOR IN THIS MOVEMENT, REMEMBER, I BELIEVE WITH ALL OF MY HEART THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT DO NOT FIGHT ALONE. HE WHO SAID BEFORE, I FORMED YOU IN THE WOMB, I KNEW YOU, FIGHTS WITH YOU. [APPLAUSE] AND WHEN WE MAKE THE CAUSE OF THE AUTHOR OF LIFE OUR CAUSE, WE MAKE HIS WORK ON THIS EARTH OUR OWN AND THAT MEANS LIFE WINS. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] SO LIFE IS WINNING IN AMERICA. MEN AND WOMEN OF SBA AND OF THIS MOVEMENT, BUT OUR WORK IS NOT DONE YET. ALEX IS ATTRIBUTED TO HAVE SAID, AMERICA IS GREAT BECAUSE AMERICA IS GOOD. AMERICA CEASES TO BE GOOD, AMERICA CEASES TO BE GREAT. I BELIEVE WITH YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT, WITH YOUR DEDICATION, THE CAUSE OF LIFE WILL BUILD ON THE EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS WE'VE MADE THESE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS. WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE PRO-LIFE MEN AND WOMEN OF PRINCIPLE ELECTED AND REELECTED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO THE STATE HOUSE. AND THE DAY WILL COME WHEN WE RESTORE THE RIGHT OF LIFE TO THE CENTER OF AMERICAN LAW AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

AS ONE PRO-LIFE ADVOCATE RECENTLY WROTE IN HER COLUMNS IN THE WASHINGTON TIMES AND I QUOTE, IF OUR GENERATION IS TO BE CONCERNED WITH THE DISENFRANCHISED, THE MARGINALIZED, WITH THE OPPRESSED AND THE OUTSIDER, THE UNBORN CHILD FITS ALL OF THESE DESCRIPTIONS. THAT IS A VOICE IN THE RISING GENERATION AND ALSO THE VOICE OF MY DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE. CHARLOTTE PENCE BOND, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF YOUR STAND FOR LIFE IN THIS RISING GENERATION. SO LIFE IS WINNING IN AMERICA. AND AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK AS A NATION TO EMERGE FROM THE HEARTBREAKING DAYS FROM WHICH WE HAVE PASSED, DAYS THAT HAVE SEEN MORE THAN 150,000 FAMILIES SUFFER LOSS, AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK EVERY DAY, BRING OUR NATION THROUGH THIS TIME OF TESTING TESTING, WE ARE COMING TO A TIME FOR CHOOSING. AND IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR LIFE. TO KEEP CARING, TO KEEP REACHING OUT WITH COMPASSION AND TO KEEP STANDING WITH ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT STAND FOR LIFE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID NOT LONG AGO, QUOTE, EVERY PERSON IS WORTH PROTECTING, EVERY HUMAN SOUL IS DIVINE AND EVERY HUMAN LIFE BORN AND UNBORN IS MADE IN THE HOLY IMAGE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AND I PROMISE YOU THIS PRESIDENT AND I WILL STAND FOR LIFE. STAND WITH WOMEN IN CRISIS PREGNANCY AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISES THAT WE MADE. NOT JUST TO THE PEOPLE OF A MOVEMENT OR A CAUSE, BUT TO THE HIGHEST IDEALS OF OUR NATION, INCLUDING THE UNALIENABLE RIGHT TO LIFE. AND IN THE DAYS AHEAD, AS YOU LABOR IN THIS MOVEMENT, REMEMBER, I BELIEVE WITH ALL OF MY HEART THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT DO NOT FIGHT ALONE. HE WHO SAID BEFORE, I FORMED YOU IN THE WOMB, I KNEW YOU, FIGHTS WITH YOU. AND WHEN WE MAKE THE CAUSE OF THE AUTHOR OF LIFE OUR CAUSE, WE MAKE HIS WORK ON THIS EARTH OUR OWN AND THAT MEANS LIFE WINS. SO LIFE IS WINNING IN AMERICA. MEN AND WOMEN OF SBA AND OF THIS MOVEMENT, BUT OUR WORK IS NOT DONE YET. ALEX IS ATTRIBUTED TO HAVE SAID, AMERICA IS GREAT BECAUSE AMERICA IS GOOD. AMERICA CEASES TO BE GOOD, AMERICA CEASES TO BE GREAT. I BELIEVE WITH YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT, WITH YOUR DEDICATION, THE CAUSE OF LIFE WILL BUILD ON THE EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS WE'VE MADE THESE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS. WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE PRO-LIFE MEN AND WOMEN OF PRINCIPLE ELECTED AND REELECTED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO THE STATE HOUSE. AND THE DAY WILL COME WHEN WE RESTORE THE RIGHT OF LIFE TO THE CENTER OF AMERICAN LAW AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU FOR ALL YOU DO AND MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?474536-1/vice-president-pence-remarks-religious-freedom	Vice President Pence delivered remarks at a Largo, Florida, church.

IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH YOU ALL AND TO BE ABLE TO HOST VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE HERE. IT IS GREAT TO SEE MANY OF YOU OUT THERE. THE LIGHTS ARE LITTLE BRIGHT. WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE HAVE TO DEFEND THE MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE. [APPLAUSE] I DID A RIDE ALONG WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS TEAM A FEW WEEKS AGO TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH. THEY NEED MORE FUNDING, NOT TO BE DEFENDED , DEFUNDED. AMEN? [APPLAUSE] THEY NEED MORE SUPPORT AND WE ARE LESS THAN 60 DAYS VOTING IN THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION EARLY IN ARIZONA IN OUR LIFETIME. THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE. ONE OF THE MAIN QUESTIONS IS GOING TO BE, WHO DO YOU TRUST TO KEEP US SAFE? WHO DO YOU TRUST TO KEEP US SAFE? THAT WILL BE DONALD TRUMP, MARTHA MCSALLY, REPUBLICAN SENATOR, RUMPLED IN-HOUSE , REPUBLICAN HOUSE, BECAUSE WE HAVE YOUR BACK. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A TIPPING POINT. YOU KNOW ARIZONA IS GROUND ZERO TO DECIDE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REELECTION, GROUND ZERO TO DECIDE THE SENATE MAJORITY. I AM WHAT IS STANDING IN THE WAY OF CHUCK SCHUMER BEING IN CHARGE. I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS LIKE CHUCK SCHUMER, DO YOU? [APPLAUSE] I KNOW JOE BIDEN AND MARKEL HE CAN HIDE IN A BASEMENT AND BUNKER ALL THEY WANT, BUT THEY ARE A TROJAN HORSE. IF THEY GET IN POWER, THE RADICAL LEFT AGENDA WILL BE JAMMED THROUGH IN A WAY THAT WE HAVE NEVER IMAGINED IN AMERICA. THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE. TODAY, WE ARE FOCUSED ON ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EVEN FAMILIES SAFE, KEEPING COMMUNITIES SAFE, AND SUPPORTING THOSE WHO EVERYTHING WILL THEY PUT ON THE UNIFORM AND GO OUT THERE TO AFFECT US. THAT'S PROTECT US. I SERVED IN THE MILITARY AND I'M GREAT ALL FOR THOSE WHO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR I WANT TO BRING UP AND INTRODUCE MY FRIEND, OUR GOVERNOR. HOW ARE YOU? I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THANK YOU TO SENATOR MCSALLY FOR HER UNWAVERING SUPPORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. WHAT A PACKED HOUSE. THIS IS THE MOST CROWDED ROOM I'VE BEEN IN IN SOME TIME. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND TO WELCOME BACK THE ONE AND ONLY VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MIKE PENCE. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, WE ARE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU BACK IN ARIZONA AGAIN. ON BEHALF OF OUR ENTIRE STATE, I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. YOU ARE HEROES. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU DO AND ARIZONA WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK. MY DAD IT A COP. AS A KID GROWING UP, WE KNEW PERSONALLY WHAT IT MEANT EVERY TIME HE SAYS GOODBYE TO HIS FAMILY. YOU SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR FAMILIES EVERY DAY. YOU CAN PROTECT OUR FAMILIES. YOU RISK YOUR LIVES SO YOU CAN SAVE OUR LIVES. THIS IS SELFLESS AND HONORABLE WORK. THAT IS WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ARE GOING TO STOP JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT FROM DEFUNDING AND DE-FAME MEAN OUR POLICE. IT'S TIME SOMEONE STARTED DEFENDING OUR POLICE. YOU HAVE OUR BACK, WE HAVE YOURS. ARIZONA WILL BACK THE BLUE IN 2020 GOING FORWARD. THE CHOICE IS CRYSTAL CLEAR. THERE WAS ONLY ONE PRESIDENTIAL TICKET ON THE BALLOT THAT BELIEVES IN LAW AND ORDER IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S WHY I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOU AND YOUR SUPPORT. WITH THAT, IT'S MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE SOMEBODY YOU ALL ALREADY KNOW VERY WELL. THE PRESIDENT OF THE POLICE ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT MEN AND WOMEN OUT HERE. THE SECRET SERVICE AS WELL. LET ME GET MY SPEECH OUT HERE. BEGINNING WITH THIS, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MYSELF. I'M PRESIDENT OF THE ARIZONA LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION AND THE POLICE ASSOCIATION. WE REPRESENT 12,000 LOCAL COUNTY AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS. THE ARIZONA POLICE ASSOCIATION HAS 27 ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING 50 DISTANT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. ON BEHALF OF THE ARIZONA POLICE ASSOCIATION IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR HOST MEMBER GROUPS, WE WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE TO ARIZONA. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ELECTED OFFICIALS PRESENT, MARTHA MCSALLY, GOVERNOR DOUG DUCEY, THE REPRESENTATIVES AND SHERIFFS WHO ARE HERE. PLEASE STAND TO BE RECOGNIZED. WITHOUT YOU, WE COULDN'T DO THIS JOB. LAW ENFORCEMENT TODAY IS THE MOST COMPLEX OCCUPATION ON EARTH. IT IS AN HONORABLE PROFESSION. THOSE WHO STEPPED IN THE GAP BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL TO PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITIES DO SO KNOWING THE RISK. OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE SPLIT-SECOND CONDITIONS UNDER THE MOST STRESSFUL SITUATIONS. OFTEN TIMES AT GREAT RISK. GIVEN THE MILLIONS OF CONTACTS BETWEEN OFFICERS AND THE COMMUNITY ANNUALLY, OFFICERS MAKE THOSE DECISIONS CORRECTLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. HIGH PROFILE NOT MEAN HIGH-FREQUENCY. IN THIS DAY AND AGE OF INSTANT INFORMATION AND SOCIAL MEDIA, THERE IS AN UNREALISTIC EXPECTATION OF ABSOLUTE PERFECTION, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE PERFECT EVERY TIME. WE HIRE FROM THE HUMAN RACE. PEOPLE ARE NOT PERFECT. GOOD PEOPLE DO MAKE MISTAKES. THE CONSTANT AND ORCHESTRATED HAS ERODED THE PUBLIC TRUST. IT HAS ENCOURAGED AN AIR OF OBSTINATE'S AND ASSAULTIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS POLICE OFFICERS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN EVERYTHING FROM OFFICERS IN YORK CITY HAVING ITS OF WATER DUMPED ON THEIR HEADS TO BEING SHOT IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD IN LAS VEGAS, FOR DOING THEIR JOBS. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THERE HAS BEEN A DROP IN POLICE APPLICANTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN RECENT YEARS. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS UNDER ATTACK. LOOK NO FURTHER THAN PLACES LIKE SEATTLE, NEW YORK, CHICAGO, LOS ANGELES, PORTLAND. A PROPOSED 50% CUT IN THE SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT BUDGET, A $1 BILLION CUT TO THE NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT, YOU WILL SEE THAT THESE ARE SERIOUS CUTS. THESE ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE ESSENTIALLY TOLD THEIR CONSTITUENTS THAT LAW AND ORDER IS NO LONGER A PRIORITY. THEY ARE LETTING THE INMATES RUN THE ASYLUM. COME TO ARIZONA. WE LOVE OUR POLICE OFFICERS. WE ARE HIRING. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR, LEADING THE CHARGE ALONG WITH MANY OTHER WONDERFUL ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO SUPPORT LAW AND ORDER. THEY WILL DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO ENSURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS FUNDED AND SAFE. WE ALL KNOW THIS NOTION OF DEFUND THE POLICE IS NOT JUST UNREALISTIC, IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND DANGEROUS. IT'S NOT ONLY DANGEROUS TO THE POLICE OFFICERS, IT IS MORE IMPORTANTLY DANGEROUS TO THE NUMBERS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO CAN'T DEFEND THEMSELVES. THEY TRUST US. THEY NEED US. WE NEED THEM. LOOK AT THE HER AND A IN VIOLENT CRIME SINCE THIS STARTED. IT IS CLEAR WHO THE LAW AND ORDER CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT IS. THANK YOU. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS FOUGHT OFF THE LIBERAL MEDIA, AND HE'S HAD AN UNWAVERING SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PLACE THEIR LIVES IN THE LINE EVERY DAY TO KEEP COMMUNITIES SAFE. WE KNOW HE HAS OUR BACK. WE HAVE HIS BACK. THAT IS WHY THE ARIZONA POLICE ASSOCIATION IS PROUD TO EXTEND OUR ENDORSEMENT TO DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND HIS VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE. [APPLAUSE] AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE FOR COMING TO THE GREAT STATE OF ARIZONA TO ACCEPT THIS ENDORSEMENT. MR. VICE PRESIDENT, COULD YOU PLEASE COME OUT? [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: HELLO, ARIZONA! [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: OFFICER JUSTIN HARRIS, TO ALL THE INCREDIBLE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ARIZONA POLICE ASSOCIATION AND THEIR SUPPORTERS, AND ESPECIALLY THEIR FAMILIES, GOVERNOR, SENATOR MCSALLY, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE GRAND CANYON STATE WITH COPS FOR TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: I APPRECIATE YOU COMING OUT TODAY. I AM VERY, VERY GRATEFUL AND HONORED TO RECEIVE THAT ENDORSEMENT. I HAVE TO BE HONEST. I AM HERE FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY. THAT IS THAT ARIZONA AND AMERICA NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [CHEERS] [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: IT REALLY IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH SO MANY GREAT FRIENDS AND SOME ANY FRIENDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT IS ALSO A REAL PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE HERE. WITH A MAN I ACTUALLY KNEW BEFORE HE HAD THE JOB HE CURRENTLY HOLDS HERE IN ARIZONA. HE HAS LITERALLY EMERGED AS ONE OF THE BEST GOVERNORS IN AMERICA. HE HAS SEEN THIS ECONOMY GROW. HE HAS SEEN SCHOOLS IMPROVE. HE HAS LET THIS GREAT STATE THROUGH TRYING TIMES OVER THE LAST MANY MONTHS. WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THINKING GOVERNOR DOUG DUCEY FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND HIS UNWAVERING SUPPORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS ARIZONA. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. SPEAKING OF FRIENDS OF MINE, ALLOW ME TO BEGIN BY BRINGING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE. WHEN I TOLD HIM LAST NIGHT I WAS HEADING TO THE GRAND CANYON STATE I THOUGHT HE SOUNDED A LITTLE JEALOUS. LET ME BRING GRATITUDE FOR TODAY'S ENDORSEMENT FROM A MAN HE WAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR LAW & ORDER EVERY DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. I BRING GREETINGS FROM THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [CHEERS] [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: ON THE PRESIDENT'S BEHALF I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO ACCEPT THE ARIZONA POLICE ASSOCIATION ENDORSEMENT FOR FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CAP THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA TO REBUILD THE MILITARY, RESTORE THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY, AND HAS THE PROUD FATHER OF A UNITED STATES MARINE STATIONED RIGHT HERE IN ARIZONA, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD WE ARE FINALLY GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, AND COAST GUARD THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DEFEND THIS NATION. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THIS PRESIDENT HAS SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG AND PRINCIPLED SUPPORT OF AN AMERICAN WHO SERVED THIS COUNTRY FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY IN UNITED STATES AIR FORCE. SHE MADE HISTORY THERE IS THE FIRST FEMALE FIGHTER PILOT EVER TO FLY IN COMBAT. FOR HER SUPPORT FOR OUR TROOPS, FOR HER SUPPORT FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY, FOR HER SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE NEED TO SEND SENATOR MARTHA MCSALLY BACK TO WASHINGTON, D.C. I AM HONORED SHE IS WITH US TODAY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THANK YOU, MARTHA. WE REBUILD OUR MILITARY. BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC STRUCK UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP WE REVIVED THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL TREATED MORE THAN 7 MILLION JOBS ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. WE LITERALLY POURED THE FOUNDATION IN THIS ECONOMY ON WHICH THE ECONOMY OF ARIZONA AND AMERICA ARE ALREADY COMING BACK. WE ALSO SUPPORTED THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RIGHT TO LIFE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS APPOINTED MORE CONSERVATIVES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS THEN ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: WE STOOD FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND WE STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE IN UNIFORM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AT EVERY LEVEL. WITH THIS PRESIDENT, THIS ADMINISTRATION, THAT SENATOR AND THAT GOVERNOR, WE WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: IT IS OUR LOUD LIES IN ARIZONA THAT IS HELPED MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. , OUR ALLIES IN ARIZONA THAT HELPED US MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. WE NEED ARIZONA DESCENT TIFFANY SHED AND BRANDON MARTIN TO A NEW MAJORITY AND UNITES HIS CONGRESS. TIFFANY AND BRANDON, STEP UP AND TAKE ABOUT. , ABOUT HOW , ABOUT BOW. VICE PRES. PENCE: FOR ALL HE HAS DONE AND ALL WE HAVE YET TO DO, WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THE PRESIDENT SPOKE TO ALMOST EVERY AMERICAN NOT LONG AGO AND HE SAID, ""THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE SELFLESS AND COURAGEOUS PUBLIC SERVANTS."" AND SO YOU ARE. I HEARD A STORY ON AIR FORCE 2 ON THE WAY HERE ABOUT ONE SUCH OFFICER. THERE WAS A STABBING THAT HAPPENED IN TUCSON. THE OFFICER ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND THE VICTIM POINTED OUT THE SUSPECT. I HEARD THE OFFICER CHASED AFTER THE SUSPECT, CAUGHT HIM AS HE WAS CLIMBING A FENCE. THE SUSPECT TURNED, SHOT HIM AND ESCAPED. HERE AND ESCAPED. THE OFFICER WAS WOUNDED IN THE LEG BUT HE KEPT HIS COMPOSURE. HE RADIOED A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUSPECT. IN TWO DAYS LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE IN TUCSON TRACKED THAT SUSPECT DOWN AND BROUGHT HIM TO JUSTICE. THE OFFICER WENT BACK TO WORK AS SOON AS HE COULD, WHERE HE SERVED THE PEOPLE OF TUCSON FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS. WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING OFFICER JOBIE DICKINSON FOR HIS SERVICE OF THAT DAY AND EVERY DAY BEFORE AND SINCE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THANK YOU, JOBIE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: GREAT JOB. I ALSO HEARD WE ARE JOINED BY ANOTHER OFFICER WHO NOT LONG AGO WAS DISPATCHED TO REPORT A HOME INVASION. THE VICTIM WAS LITERALLY TIED UP AND HELPLESS. THE OFFICER SPOTTED THE SUSPECT'S VEHICLE, DROVE AFTER THEM. THE SUSPECTS FIRED MORE THAN 100 ROUNDS OVER MORE THAN 10 MILES OF A CHASE. AT ONE POINT THE OFFICER'S VEHICLE WAS DISABLED FROM THE GUNFIRE. ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER PICKED HIM UP AND THEY KEPT AFTER IT. THEY KEPT GOING UNTIL THEY CAUGHT THE SUSPECTS, REST OF THEM , ARRESTED THEM, AND BROUGHT THEM TO JUSTICE. JOIN ME IN THINKING OFFICER TROY WALLEN. WHERE ARE YOU, TROY? TAKE A BOW. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: NEVER QUIT. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: GREAT JOB. HEROES LIKE THESE OFFICERS ARE WHY THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS BACK THE BLUE. WE BACK YOU EVERYDAY. WHEN OTHERS RUN AWAY FROM DANGER, POLICE OFFICERS RUN STRAIGHT INTO HARM'S WAY. YOU COUNT OUR LIVES AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR OWN. PUT YOUR LIVES IN THE LINE TO PROTECT SOMEONE THAT IN MOST CASES YOU'VE NEVER EVEN MET. NOWHERE HAS THAT BEEN TRUE OR OR MORE POIGNANT , TRUER OR MORE POIGNANT THAN OVER THE PAST FIVE MONTHS HERE IN ARIZONA AND ACROSS AMERICA. OUR HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH THEM MORE THAN 160,000 AMERICANS WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES IN THE MIDST THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. AS WE CONTINUE TO MARSHALL A WHOLE OF AMERICA RESPONSE, AS THE GOVERNOR OFTEN SAYS, WE ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY TO DO OUR PART AND SLOW THE SPREAD AND PROTECT THE VULNERABLE AND SAVE LIVES. THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA ARE DOING JUST THAT. LAST WEEK, THE GOVERNOR WAS IN WASHINGTON TO BRIEF THE PRESIDENT ON THE PROGRESS YOU HAVE MADE. WE ARE PLEASED TO LEND THE POSITIVITY RATES HAVE DROPPED 21%, DOWN TO 12%. NEW CASES HAVE BEEN STEADILY DROPPING FOR A MONTH. THAT IS TRIBUTE TO YOUR GOVERNOR, PAY TRIBUTE TO THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO FLATTEN THE CURVE AND SAVE LIVES. AS I SAID, IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES NOT HAVE DONE MORE TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES THAT ARE HEROIC HEALTH-CARE WORKERS, FIRST RESPONDERS, AND THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE IN ARIZONA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: IT'S TRUE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: YOU STEPPED INTO HARM'S WAY. OFTEN WITHOUT REGARD TO YOUR PERSONAL SAFETY. THE RENDERED ASSISTANCE. YOU GOT PEOPLE OF THE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO THE CARE ANYONE OF US WOULD WANT A FAMILY NUMBER TO HAVE. YOU STOOD IN THE GAP IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC. YOU HAVE THE THANKS AND ADMIRATION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY IT IS AMAZING TO THINK THAT IN THE WAKE OF ALL THAT HEROISM, EVEN THE HEROISM OF THESE RECENT DAYS, SOME OF THE LEADING POLITICIANS AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TODAY LIKE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO STORMTROOPERS. JOE BIDEN SAID NOT LONG AGO THAT WELL ARMED POLICE BECOME IN HIS WORDS ""THE ENEMY."" I WANT TO ASSURE YOU YOU'RE PRESIDENT, YOU'RE VICE PRESIDENT, AND THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE THE BEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: LAW ENFORCEMENT ISN'T THE PROBLEM. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THE SOLUTION. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: MUCH LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OUR ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION BACK THE BLUE, LIKE EVERYONE GATHERED HERE TODAY. WE WILL STAND WITH A MINUTE WOMEN WHO SERVE ON THE THIN BLUE LINE EVERY DAY. YOU ARE LITERALLY WHAT SEPARATES ORDER FROM CHAOS. [APPLAUSE] SECURITY IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR PROSPERITY. SO, IT HAS BEEN YOU, YOU AND THE UNIFORM, WHO HAVE STRAPPED ON A SIDEARM, WHO HAVE KISSED YOUR FAMILIES GOODBYE IN THE MORNING AND WALKED OUT INTO THAT SQUAD CAR OR WALK TO THE BEAT, IT IS YOU WHO MADE THE FREEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD POSSIBLE. YOU MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THIS NATION TO THRIVE AND PROSPER. AND IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES, TO RECOVER. AND FOR EVERY AMERICAN, TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN PEACE AND SECURITY, THAT EVERY CITIZEN SO RICHLY DESERVES. SO, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE ARE PASSING THROUGH A TIME OF TESTING. BUT I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE WILL SOON COME TO A TIME FOR CHOOSING, THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER, AND THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. IT REALLY IS A CHOICE BETWEEN FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY VERSUS SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT OFFER A PATH STARKLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PAST PRESIDENT TRUMP SET OUR NATION ON THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO. WHERE WE HAVE CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR WORKING FAMILIES, BUSINESSES, RANCHES AND FAMILY FARMS. JOE BIDEN WOULD ACTUALLY RAISE TAXES BY $4 TRILLION IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS CUT MORE FEDERAL RATE TAPE THAN ANY , RED TAPE THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN PLANS TO BURY OUR ECONOMY UNDER AN AVALANCHE OF RED TAPE, STIFLING JOBS. JOE BIDEN EVEN HAS A PLAN TO ABOLISH FOSSIL FUELS. BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] AND IS NOT JUST ABOUT JOBS, IT IS ABOUT VALUES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT ONLY STOOD FOR THE RULE OF LAW, BUT FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. AND JOE BIDEN WHERE JOE BIDEN ABANDON HIS HISTORIC OPPOSITION TO TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION, HE NOW SUPPORTS USING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO FUND ABORTION IN THIS COUNTRY, AND IS CALLING FOR HISTORIC INCREASES TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AND MAYBE WORST OF ALL, AS WE GATHER TODAY FOR COPS FOR TRUMP IN ARIZONA, JOE BIDEN BELIEVES AMERICA IS, QUOTE, ""SYSTEMICALLY RACIST."" AND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS, AGAIN, ""AN IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST MINORITIES."" WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAS SUPPORTED THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE RADICAL LEFT SAYS WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING OUR POLICE OR SUPPORTING ALL THE FAMILIES OF OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA KNOW DIFFERENT, THE MAKE AND PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE DO NOT NEED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IS SUPPORTING OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORS. WE CAN DO BOTH. WE HAVE DONE BOTH. AND WE WILL KEEP DOING BOTH FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. [APPLAUSE] THE TRUTH IS, AS WE STAND HERE TODAY, AS JUSTIN SAID, CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY NEED TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. AND ARE MAKING THE WRONG CHOICE. AND CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IN THOSE CITIES YOU HAVE ELECTED OFFICIALS STEPPING AWAY FROM SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, BELIEVING THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY, AND SUPPORTING FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY. I JUST HEARD MINNEAPOLIS HAS ALREADY BEGUN DISMANTLING THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENT. IN NEW YORK CITY, MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO ACTUALLY CUT THE NYPD BUDGET BY $1 BILLION. AND ON MONDAY OF THIS WEEK, THE SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL ACTUALLY APPROVED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BUDGET CUTS TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. AFTER WATCHING ANARCHISTS AND RIOTERS TAKE OVER PART OF THEIR CITY FOR MORE THAN THREE WEEKS. AND WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS ASKED IF HE WOULD SUPPORT CUTTING FUNDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, HE REPLIED, YES, ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW, AMID EFFORTS TO DEFUND THE POLICE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, CITIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH RISING CRIME RATES. HISTORY TEACHES THAT WEAKNESS AROUSES PEOPLE. AND AS WE SEE MAJOR CITIES STEPPING AWAY FROM SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, BUYING INTO THE AGENDA OF THE RADICAL LEFT, WE ARE ALSO SEEING CRIME RISE IN THOSE VERY SAME CITIES ACROSS THE NATION. JUST THIS PAST WEEKEND ALONE, WE HAD 40 PEOPLE SHOT IN CHICAGO. NEW YORK CITY REACHED ITS 1000TH VICTIM,AND HAS HAD MORE SHOOTINGS THIS YEAR THAN IN ALL OF THE LAST YEAR ALREADY. IN FACT, IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL, 21 PEOPLE WERE SHOT AT A BLOCK PARTY JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. IN CITY AFTER CITY, WE SEE THE CRIME RATE RISING, THE MURDER RATE RISING. IN CITIES THAT ARE STEPPING AWAY FROM SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE FAMILIES, IN EVERY MAJOR CITY IN THIS LAND, MEN AND WOMEN OF ARIZONA, THIS HAS GOT TO STOP. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO DO IT. HONESTLY, THOSE HEARTBREAKING NUMBERS ARE JUST A PREVIEW OF JOE BIDEN'S AGENDA. THE TRUTH IS, YOU WILL NOT BE SAFE IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA. AFTER YEARS OF PLUMMETING CRIME RATES UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, JOE BIDEN WOULD DOUBLE DOWN ON THE POLICIES THAT ARE LEADING TO VIOLENCE ON THE STREETS OF AMERICAN CITIES. WHEN DEMOCRATS CALL FOR DEFUNDING THE POLICE, REMEMBER WHAT IS AT STAKE , LAW AND ORDER, SAFETY, AND THE PEACE OF MIND THAT OUR FAMILIES AND OUR CHILDREN HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO EXPECT IN THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH. AS THEY MAKE THEIR CASE, ON THE AIRWAVES OF THE NATION NEXT WEEK, I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS DIRECTLY FROM ME, ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND OUR ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DEFUND THE POLICE, NOT NOW, NOT EVER. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO BACK THE BLUE. WE ARE GOING TO BACK THE BLUE WITH MORE RESOURCES AND WITH MORE SUPPORT. WE ARE GOING TO BACK OF THE BLUEBIRD MAKING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY, ENHANCED TRAINING AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND FUNDING LIKE THE FUNDING WE PROVIDED FOR 4000 NEW POLICE OFFICERS THROUGH THE COPS PROGRAM. AND AS THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED A MONTH AGO, BY MAKING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. WE ARE GOING TO HELP THEM GET BETTER TRAINED TO DO THEIR JOB IN THE MOST DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. ALL OF YOU GATHERED HERE KNOW, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WEARING THE UNIFORM, NO ONE HATES BAD COPS, ONLY BAD COPS. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE FLOYD, AND JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED, BUT THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR RIOTING AND LOOTING AND THE ARSON THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE DAYS OF THAT FOLLOWED. [APPLAUSE] BURNING CHURCHES IS NOT PROTEST, TAKING DOWN STATUES IS NOT FREE SPEECH. THROWING ROCKS AT OFFICERS IN TUCSON IS NOT PEACEFUL PROTEST. AND THOSE WHO DO SUCH THINGS ARE NOT PEACEFUL PROTESTERS, THEY ARE CRIMINALS AND THEY WILL BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. [APPLAUSE] WHILE JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CONTINUE TO CODDLE THE RADICAL LEFT, FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITAL TO CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING ACTION TO RESTORE LAW AND ORDER. JUST LAST MONTH AT THE WHITE HOUSE, HE ANNOUNCED WHAT WE CALL OPERATION LEGEND, A SURGE OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS INTO OUR HARDEST HIT CITIES. CITIES THAT ARE EXPERIENCING ENORMOUS SURGES IN VIOLENCE AND CRIME. DUE TO MISS GOVERNANCE , MISGOVERNANCE IN THE DRIVE FOR DEFUNDING , AND THE DRIVER DEFUNDING FROM THE RADICAL LEFT. THE OPERATION IS NAMED AFTER A FOUR YEAR OLD AFRICAN-AMERICAN BOY, NAMED LEGEND. LAST MONTH, LITTLE LEGEND WAS GUNNED DOWN WHILE SLEEPING IN HIS HOME IN KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI. THAT FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY HAD SPENT THE NIGHT BEFORE BUILDING A PILLOW FORCE WITH HIS DAD. , FORT WITH HIS DAD. AND WHEN HE WAS SHOT, HE WAS SLEEPING IN THE FORT HE AND HIS DAD HAD MADE. WHEN POLICE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE, THEY RUSHED HIM TO THE HOSPITAL BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. LITTLE LEGEND DIED OF HIS INJURIES. WITH THE LAUNCH OF OPERATION LEGEND, I PROMISE YOU THAT LITTLE LEGEND WILL NOT HAVE DIED IN VAIN. [APPLAUSE] THE OPERATION IN HIS NAME IS, AS WE SPEAK MY BRINGING PEACE AND SECURITY TO CITIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHEN HIS MOTHER HEARD ABOUT THE OPERATION, EVEN HEARD SOME OF THE CRITICISM, HIS MOM SAID, ""IF YOU ARE AGAINST THAT, MAYBE YOU NEED TO REEVALUATE."" SHE WAS RIGHT. BUT IT'S STORIES LIKE LEGEND, THAT BREAK THE HEART OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT IS, IT'S LITTLE ONES LIKE LEGEND, AND LIKE HIS FAMILY, THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH HE LIVED, THAT DREW THOSE OF YOU WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM INTO SERVICE. LAW ENFORCEMENT ISN'T AN OCCUPATION SO MUCH IT IS A CALLING. AND I NEVER TALK TO A POLICE OFFICER THAT DIDN'T SPEAK OF IT JUST THAT WAY. IT'S A SELFLESS CALLING. TO COUNT OTHERS AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOURSELF. IT'S A CALLING TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE, TO STAND THE WATCH. AND IT IS A CALLING THAT IS BORN MORE OF THE HEART THAN OF THE MIND. AND EVERY POLICE OFFICER I'VE EVER SPOKEN TO ABOUT WHY THEY SERVE HAS MADE IT CLEAR, YOU SERVE BECAUSE YOU LOVE THIS COUNTRY. YOU LOVE YOUR CITY. YOU LOVE THIS STATE. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ARIZONA AND AMERICA OLIVIA RIGHT BACK. , LOVE YOU RIGHT BACK. [APPLAUSE] AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, WE MAY COME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS BUT WE ARE UNITED IN OUR DESIRE TO SHARE PEACE. YOU ARE THE INSTRUMENT OF SECURING THAT FOR EVERY AMERICAN, OF EVERY BACKGROUND AND EVERY WALK OF LIFE. SO FOR ALL YOU DO ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL NATION, I PROMISE YOU THAT WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK. THIS PRESIDENT, THIS VICE PRESIDENT, THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE WE ARE ALL GRATEFUL, GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU DO. IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETIMES I REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT ALL OF MY HEROES WEAR UNIFORMS. NOT ON THE GRIDIRON, NOT ON THE HARDCOURT, BUT WEAR THE UNIFORMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, WEAR THE UNIFORM OF OUR ARMED FORCES. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY, WE WOULD DRIVE TO CHICAGO TO MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE, AND I GOT TO SEE MY UNCLE. HE WOULD DRESS OUT EVERY DAY THAT WE WERE THERE. WHEN HE WOULD COME WALKING OUT OF HIS BEDROOM WEARING THAT CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT UNIFORM, THAT SHINY LEATHER BELT, THE SIDEARM, BADGE ON HIS CHEST, IT MADE ME PROUD. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU THAT WEARS THE UNIFORM, BUT TELL YOUR FAMILIES WE ARE JUST AS GRATEFUL TO THEM, BECAUSE I WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WEAR THAT UNIFORM, BUT I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE A MEMBER OF A FAMILY THAT DOES. AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR FAMILIES, FOR THE LOVE AND SUPPORT THAT THEY GIVE YOU AS YOU SERVE. [APPLAUSE] ON BEHALF OF YOUR PRESIDENT AND ALL OF THE GRATEFUL AMERICAN PEOPLE, I'M HERE TO SAY THANKS. AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE GRATITUDE AND RESPECT OF THIS NATION. YOU SEE IT WHEN YOU ARE WALKING THE BEAT, WHEN YOU STOP TO GET A CUP OF COFFEE, WHEN YOU BUMP INTO PEOPLE AT THE GROCERY STORE, THE CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE OR YOUR PLACE OF WORSHIP. PEOPLE SHOW YOU THAT RESPECT. I KNOW THAT YOU FEEL IT EVERY DAY. DESPITE WHAT HAPPENS IN PUBLIC DEBATE OR ON THE AIRWAVES OF TELEVISION, I KNOW HER ON THE STREETS OF TUCSON AND ALL ACROSS ARIZONA, YOU FEEL THE GRATITUDE. I ALSO HOPE YOU FEEL ONE OTHER THING. I HOPE AS YOU GO OUT THE DOOR IN THE MORNING, I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT I BELIEVE WITH ALL OF MY HEART THAT YOU ARE CARRIED INTO SERVICE EVERY DAY BY THE PRAYERS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO PRAY FOR YOU, PRAY FOR YOUR SAFETY IN PRAY FOR YOUR SERVICE EVERY SINGLE DAY , AND PRAY FOR YOUR SERVICE EVERY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS THE NATION OF FAITH. I HEAR PEOPLE SPEAK ABOUT IT EVERYWHERE I GO, AND I NEVER WANT YOU TO DOUBT IT. WHEN YOU PUT ON THE UNIFORM YOU DO NOT GO ALONE, YOU GO WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF YOUR PRESIDENT, THE CONFIDENCE OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU SERVE. I BELIEVE YOU ALSO GO WITH THE GRACE OF GOD. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT BEAR GREAT RESPONSE ABILITY, IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN TRUE , RESPONSIBILITY, HAS ALWAYS BEEN TRUE. THE BIBLE REMINDS US THERE IS NO AUTHORITY BUT WHICH GOD HAS ESTABLISHED, AND EACH ONE OF YOU THAT PROTECTS AND DESERVES, OR AS THE GOOD BOOK SAYS, SERVICE FOR GOOD, DO NOT BEAR THE SWORD IN VAIN. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT TRUTH, THEY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS THAT YOU TAKE AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU DO. ON THEIR BEHALF, AND ON OUR BEHALF, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TODAY. [APPLAUSE] IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE BACK IN ARIZONA. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TO SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TO SUPPORT SENATOR MCSALLY. AND I KNOW, JUST SEEING THE ENTHUSIASM IN THIS ROOM, IF WE DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY, IN ARIZONA AND ACROSS AMERICA, WE WILL WIN A GREAT VICTORY FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY.

OFFICER JUSTIN HARRIS, TO ALL THE INCREDIBLE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ARIZONA POLICE ASSOCIATION AND THEIR SUPPORTERS, AND ESPECIALLY THEIR FAMILIES, GOVERNOR, SENATOR MCSALLY, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE GRAND CANYON STATE WITH COPS FOR TRUMP. I APPRECIATE YOU COMING OUT TODAY. I AM VERY, VERY GRATEFUL AND HONORED TO RECEIVE THAT ENDORSEMENT. I HAVE TO BE HONEST. I AM HERE FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY. THAT IS THAT ARIZONA AND AMERICA NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IT REALLY IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH SO MANY GREAT FRIENDS AND SOME ANY FRIENDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT IS ALSO A REAL PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE HERE. WITH A MAN I ACTUALLY KNEW BEFORE HE HAD THE JOB HE CURRENTLY HOLDS HERE IN ARIZONA. HE HAS LITERALLY EMERGED AS ONE OF THE BEST GOVERNORS IN AMERICA. HE HAS SEEN THIS ECONOMY GROW. HE HAS SEEN SCHOOLS IMPROVE. HE HAS LET THIS GREAT STATE THROUGH TRYING TIMES OVER THE LAST MANY MONTHS. WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THINKING GOVERNOR DOUG DUCEY FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND HIS UNWAVERING SUPPORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS ARIZONA. THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. SPEAKING OF FRIENDS OF MINE, ALLOW ME TO BEGIN BY BRINGING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE. WHEN I TOLD HIM LAST NIGHT I WAS HEADING TO THE GRAND CANYON STATE I THOUGHT HE SOUNDED A LITTLE JEALOUS. LET ME BRING GRATITUDE FOR TODAY'S ENDORSEMENT FROM A MAN HE WAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR LAW & ORDER EVERY DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. I BRING GREETINGS FROM THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. ON THE PRESIDENT'S BEHALF I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO ACCEPT THE ARIZONA POLICE ASSOCIATION ENDORSEMENT FOR FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CAP THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA TO REBUILD THE MILITARY, RESTORE THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY, AND HAS THE PROUD FATHER OF A UNITED STATES MARINE STATIONED RIGHT HERE IN ARIZONA, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD WE ARE FINALLY GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, AND COAST GUARD THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DEFEND THIS NATION. THIS PRESIDENT HAS SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG AND PRINCIPLED SUPPORT OF AN AMERICAN WHO SERVED THIS COUNTRY FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY IN UNITED STATES AIR FORCE. SHE MADE HISTORY THERE IS THE FIRST FEMALE FIGHTER PILOT EVER TO FLY IN COMBAT. FOR HER SUPPORT FOR OUR TROOPS, FOR HER SUPPORT FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY, FOR HER SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE NEED TO SEND SENATOR MARTHA MCSALLY BACK TO WASHINGTON, D.C. I AM HONORED SHE IS WITH US TODAY. THANK YOU, MARTHA. WE REBUILD OUR MILITARY. BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC STRUCK UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP WE REVIVED THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL TREATED MORE THAN 7 MILLION JOBS ALL ACROSS THIS NATION. WE LITERALLY POURED THE FOUNDATION IN THIS ECONOMY ON WHICH THE ECONOMY OF ARIZONA AND AMERICA ARE ALREADY COMING BACK. WE ALSO SUPPORTED THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RIGHT TO LIFE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS APPOINTED MORE CONSERVATIVES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS THEN ANY PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE STOOD FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND WE STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE IN UNIFORM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AT EVERY LEVEL. WITH THIS PRESIDENT, THIS ADMINISTRATION, THAT SENATOR AND THAT GOVERNOR, WE WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. IT IS OUR LOUD LIES IN ARIZONA THAT IS HELPED MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. , OUR ALLIES IN ARIZONA THAT HELPED US MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. WE NEED ARIZONA DESCENT TIFFANY SHED AND BRANDON MARTIN TO A NEW MAJORITY AND UNITES HIS CONGRESS. TIFFANY AND BRANDON, STEP UP AND TAKE ABOUT. , ABOUT HOW , ABOUT BOW. FOR ALL HE HAS DONE AND ALL WE HAVE YET TO DO, WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THE PRESIDENT SPOKE TO ALMOST EVERY AMERICAN NOT LONG AGO AND HE SAID, 'THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE SELFLESS AND COURAGEOUS PUBLIC SERVANTS.' AND SO YOU ARE. I HEARD A STORY ON AIR FORCE 2 ON THE WAY HERE ABOUT ONE SUCH OFFICER. THERE WAS A STABBING THAT HAPPENED IN TUCSON. THE OFFICER ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND THE VICTIM POINTED OUT THE SUSPECT. I HEARD THE OFFICER CHASED AFTER THE SUSPECT, CAUGHT HIM AS HE WAS CLIMBING A FENCE. THE SUSPECT TURNED, SHOT HIM AND ESCAPED. HERE AND ESCAPED. THE OFFICER WAS WOUNDED IN THE LEG BUT HE KEPT HIS COMPOSURE. HE RADIOED A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUSPECT. IN TWO DAYS LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE IN TUCSON TRACKED THAT SUSPECT DOWN AND BROUGHT HIM TO JUSTICE. THE OFFICER WENT BACK TO WORK AS SOON AS HE COULD, WHERE HE SERVED THE PEOPLE OF TUCSON FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS. WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING OFFICER JOBIE DICKINSON FOR HIS SERVICE OF THAT DAY AND EVERY DAY BEFORE AND SINCE. THANK YOU, JOBIE. GREAT JOB. I ALSO HEARD WE ARE JOINED BY ANOTHER OFFICER WHO NOT LONG AGO WAS DISPATCHED TO REPORT A HOME INVASION. THE VICTIM WAS LITERALLY TIED UP AND HELPLESS. THE OFFICER SPOTTED THE SUSPECT'S VEHICLE, DROVE AFTER THEM. THE SUSPECTS FIRED MORE THAN 100 ROUNDS OVER MORE THAN 10 MILES OF A CHASE. AT ONE POINT THE OFFICER'S VEHICLE WAS DISABLED FROM THE GUNFIRE. ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER PICKED HIM UP AND THEY KEPT AFTER IT. THEY KEPT GOING UNTIL THEY CAUGHT THE SUSPECTS, REST OF THEM , ARRESTED THEM, AND BROUGHT THEM TO JUSTICE. JOIN ME IN THINKING OFFICER TROY WALLEN. WHERE ARE YOU, TROY? TAKE A BOW. NEVER QUIT. GREAT JOB. HEROES LIKE THESE OFFICERS ARE WHY THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS BACK THE BLUE. WE BACK YOU EVERYDAY. WHEN OTHERS RUN AWAY FROM DANGER, POLICE OFFICERS RUN STRAIGHT INTO HARM'S WAY. YOU COUNT OUR LIVES AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR OWN. PUT YOUR LIVES IN THE LINE TO PROTECT SOMEONE THAT IN MOST CASES YOU'VE NEVER EVEN MET. NOWHERE HAS THAT BEEN TRUE OR OR MORE POIGNANT , TRUER OR MORE POIGNANT THAN OVER THE PAST FIVE MONTHS HERE IN ARIZONA AND ACROSS AMERICA. OUR HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH THEM MORE THAN 160,000 AMERICANS WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES IN THE MIDST THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. AS WE CONTINUE TO MARSHALL A WHOLE OF AMERICA RESPONSE, AS THE GOVERNOR OFTEN SAYS, WE ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY TO DO OUR PART AND SLOW THE SPREAD AND PROTECT THE VULNERABLE AND SAVE LIVES. THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA ARE DOING JUST THAT. LAST WEEK, THE GOVERNOR WAS IN WASHINGTON TO BRIEF THE PRESIDENT ON THE PROGRESS YOU HAVE MADE. WE ARE PLEASED TO LEND THE POSITIVITY RATES HAVE DROPPED 21%, DOWN TO 12%. NEW CASES HAVE BEEN STEADILY DROPPING FOR A MONTH. THAT IS TRIBUTE TO YOUR GOVERNOR, PAY TRIBUTE TO THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO FLATTEN THE CURVE AND SAVE LIVES. AS I SAID, IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES NOT HAVE DONE MORE TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES THAT ARE HEROIC HEALTH-CARE WORKERS, FIRST RESPONDERS, AND THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE IN ARIZONA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT'S TRUE. YOU STEPPED INTO HARM'S WAY. OFTEN WITHOUT REGARD TO YOUR PERSONAL SAFETY. THE RENDERED ASSISTANCE. YOU GOT PEOPLE OF THE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO THE CARE ANYONE OF US WOULD WANT A FAMILY NUMBER TO HAVE. YOU STOOD IN THE GAP IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC. YOU HAVE THE THANKS AND ADMIRATION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY IT IS AMAZING TO THINK THAT IN THE WAKE OF ALL THAT HEROISM, EVEN THE HEROISM OF THESE RECENT DAYS, SOME OF THE LEADING POLITICIANS AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TODAY LIKE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO STORMTROOPERS. JOE BIDEN SAID NOT LONG AGO THAT WELL ARMED POLICE BECOME IN HIS WORDS 'THE ENEMY.' I WANT TO ASSURE YOU YOU'RE PRESIDENT, YOU'RE VICE PRESIDENT, AND THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE THE BEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. LAW ENFORCEMENT ISN'T THE PROBLEM. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THE SOLUTION. MUCH LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OUR ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION BACK THE BLUE, LIKE EVERYONE GATHERED HERE TODAY. WE WILL STAND WITH A MINUTE WOMEN WHO SERVE ON THE THIN BLUE LINE EVERY DAY. YOU ARE LITERALLY WHAT SEPARATES ORDER FROM CHAOS. SECURITY IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR PROSPERITY. SO, IT HAS BEEN YOU, YOU AND THE UNIFORM, WHO HAVE STRAPPED ON A SIDEARM, WHO HAVE KISSED YOUR FAMILIES GOODBYE IN THE MORNING AND WALKED OUT INTO THAT SQUAD CAR OR WALK TO THE BEAT, IT IS YOU WHO MADE THE FREEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD POSSIBLE. YOU MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THIS NATION TO THRIVE AND PROSPER. AND IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES, TO RECOVER. AND FOR EVERY AMERICAN, TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN PEACE AND SECURITY, THAT EVERY CITIZEN SO RICHLY DESERVES. SO, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE ARE PASSING THROUGH A TIME OF TESTING. BUT I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE WILL SOON COME TO A TIME FOR CHOOSING, THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER, AND THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. IT REALLY IS A CHOICE BETWEEN FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY VERSUS SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFT OFFER A PATH STARKLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PAST PRESIDENT TRUMP SET OUR NATION ON THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO. WHERE WE HAVE CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR WORKING FAMILIES, BUSINESSES, RANCHES AND FAMILY FARMS. JOE BIDEN WOULD ACTUALLY RAISE TAXES BY $4 TRILLION IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS CUT MORE FEDERAL RATE TAPE THAN ANY , RED TAPE THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN PLANS TO BURY OUR ECONOMY UNDER AN AVALANCHE OF RED TAPE, STIFLING JOBS. JOE BIDEN EVEN HAS A PLAN TO ABOLISH FOSSIL FUELS. BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN. AND IS NOT JUST ABOUT JOBS, IT IS ABOUT VALUES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT ONLY STOOD FOR THE RULE OF LAW, BUT FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. AND JOE BIDEN WHERE JOE BIDEN ABANDON HIS HISTORIC OPPOSITION TO TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION, HE NOW SUPPORTS USING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO FUND ABORTION IN THIS COUNTRY, AND IS CALLING FOR HISTORIC INCREASES TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AND MAYBE WORST OF ALL, AS WE GATHER TODAY FOR COPS FOR TRUMP IN ARIZONA, JOE BIDEN BELIEVES AMERICA IS, QUOTE, 'SYSTEMICALLY RACIST.' AND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS, AGAIN, 'AN IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST MINORITIES.' WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAS SUPPORTED THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE RADICAL LEFT SAYS WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING OUR POLICE OR SUPPORTING ALL THE FAMILIES OF OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA KNOW DIFFERENT, THE MAKE AND PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE DO NOT NEED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IS SUPPORTING OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORS. WE CAN DO BOTH. WE HAVE DONE BOTH. AND WE WILL KEEP DOING BOTH FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. THE TRUTH IS, AS WE STAND HERE TODAY, AS JUSTIN SAID, CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY NEED TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. AND ARE MAKING THE WRONG CHOICE. AND CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IN THOSE CITIES YOU HAVE ELECTED OFFICIALS STEPPING AWAY FROM SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, BELIEVING THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY, AND SUPPORTING FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY. I JUST HEARD MINNEAPOLIS HAS ALREADY BEGUN DISMANTLING THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENT. IN NEW YORK CITY, MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO ACTUALLY CUT THE NYPD BUDGET BY $1 BILLION. AND ON MONDAY OF THIS WEEK, THE SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL ACTUALLY APPROVED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BUDGET CUTS TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. AFTER WATCHING ANARCHISTS AND RIOTERS TAKE OVER PART OF THEIR CITY FOR MORE THAN THREE WEEKS. AND WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS ASKED IF HE WOULD SUPPORT CUTTING FUNDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, HE REPLIED, YES, ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW, AMID EFFORTS TO DEFUND THE POLICE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, CITIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH RISING CRIME RATES. HISTORY TEACHES THAT WEAKNESS AROUSES PEOPLE. AND AS WE SEE MAJOR CITIES STEPPING AWAY FROM SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, BUYING INTO THE AGENDA OF THE RADICAL LEFT, WE ARE ALSO SEEING CRIME RISE IN THOSE VERY SAME CITIES ACROSS THE NATION. JUST THIS PAST WEEKEND ALONE, WE HAD 40 PEOPLE SHOT IN CHICAGO. NEW YORK CITY REACHED ITS 1000TH VICTIM,AND HAS HAD MORE SHOOTINGS THIS YEAR THAN IN ALL OF THE LAST YEAR ALREADY. IN FACT, IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL, 21 PEOPLE WERE SHOT AT A BLOCK PARTY JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. IN CITY AFTER CITY, WE SEE THE CRIME RATE RISING, THE MURDER RATE RISING. IN CITIES THAT ARE STEPPING AWAY FROM SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE FAMILIES, IN EVERY MAJOR CITY IN THIS LAND, MEN AND WOMEN OF ARIZONA, THIS HAS GOT TO STOP. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT. HONESTLY, THOSE HEARTBREAKING NUMBERS ARE JUST A PREVIEW OF JOE BIDEN'S AGENDA. THE TRUTH IS, YOU WILL NOT BE SAFE IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA. AFTER YEARS OF PLUMMETING CRIME RATES UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, JOE BIDEN WOULD DOUBLE DOWN ON THE POLICIES THAT ARE LEADING TO VIOLENCE ON THE STREETS OF AMERICAN CITIES. WHEN DEMOCRATS CALL FOR DEFUNDING THE POLICE, REMEMBER WHAT IS AT STAKE , LAW AND ORDER, SAFETY, AND THE PEACE OF MIND THAT OUR FAMILIES AND OUR CHILDREN HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO EXPECT IN THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH. AS THEY MAKE THEIR CASE, ON THE AIRWAVES OF THE NATION NEXT WEEK, I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS DIRECTLY FROM ME, ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND OUR ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DEFUND THE POLICE, NOT NOW, NOT EVER. WE ARE GOING TO BACK THE BLUE. WE ARE GOING TO BACK THE BLUE WITH MORE RESOURCES AND WITH MORE SUPPORT. WE ARE GOING TO BACK OF THE BLUEBIRD MAKING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY, ENHANCED TRAINING AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND FUNDING LIKE THE FUNDING WE PROVIDED FOR 4000 NEW POLICE OFFICERS THROUGH THE COPS PROGRAM. AND AS THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED A MONTH AGO, BY MAKING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. WE ARE GOING TO HELP THEM GET BETTER TRAINED TO DO THEIR JOB IN THE MOST DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. ALL OF YOU GATHERED HERE KNOW, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WEARING THE UNIFORM, NO ONE HATES BAD COPS, ONLY BAD COPS. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE FLOYD, AND JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED, BUT THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR RIOTING AND LOOTING AND THE ARSON THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE DAYS OF THAT FOLLOWED. BURNING CHURCHES IS NOT PROTEST, TAKING DOWN STATUES IS NOT FREE SPEECH. THROWING ROCKS AT OFFICERS IN TUCSON IS NOT PEACEFUL PROTEST. AND THOSE WHO DO SUCH THINGS ARE NOT PEACEFUL PROTESTERS, THEY ARE CRIMINALS AND THEY WILL BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. WHILE JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CONTINUE TO CODDLE THE RADICAL LEFT, FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITAL TO CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING ACTION TO RESTORE LAW AND ORDER. JUST LAST MONTH AT THE WHITE HOUSE, HE ANNOUNCED WHAT WE CALL OPERATION LEGEND, A SURGE OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS INTO OUR HARDEST HIT CITIES. CITIES THAT ARE EXPERIENCING ENORMOUS SURGES IN VIOLENCE AND CRIME. DUE TO MISS GOVERNANCE , MISGOVERNANCE IN THE DRIVE FOR DEFUNDING , AND THE DRIVER DEFUNDING FROM THE RADICAL LEFT. THE OPERATION IS NAMED AFTER A FOUR YEAR OLD AFRICAN-AMERICAN BOY, NAMED LEGEND. LAST MONTH, LITTLE LEGEND WAS GUNNED DOWN WHILE SLEEPING IN HIS HOME IN KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI. THAT FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY HAD SPENT THE NIGHT BEFORE BUILDING A PILLOW FORCE WITH HIS DAD. , FORT WITH HIS DAD. AND WHEN HE WAS SHOT, HE WAS SLEEPING IN THE FORT HE AND HIS DAD HAD MADE. WHEN POLICE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE, THEY RUSHED HIM TO THE HOSPITAL BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. LITTLE LEGEND DIED OF HIS INJURIES. WITH THE LAUNCH OF OPERATION LEGEND, I PROMISE YOU THAT LITTLE LEGEND WILL NOT HAVE DIED IN VAIN. THE OPERATION IN HIS NAME IS, AS WE SPEAK MY BRINGING PEACE AND SECURITY TO CITIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHEN HIS MOTHER HEARD ABOUT THE OPERATION, EVEN HEARD SOME OF THE CRITICISM, HIS MOM SAID, 'IF YOU ARE AGAINST THAT, MAYBE YOU NEED TO REEVALUATE.' SHE WAS RIGHT. BUT IT'S STORIES LIKE LEGEND, THAT BREAK THE HEART OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT IS, IT'S LITTLE ONES LIKE LEGEND, AND LIKE HIS FAMILY, THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH HE LIVED, THAT DREW THOSE OF YOU WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM INTO SERVICE. LAW ENFORCEMENT ISN'T AN OCCUPATION SO MUCH IT IS A CALLING. AND I NEVER TALK TO A POLICE OFFICER THAT DIDN'T SPEAK OF IT JUST THAT WAY. IT'S A SELFLESS CALLING. TO COUNT OTHERS AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOURSELF. IT'S A CALLING TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE, TO STAND THE WATCH. AND IT IS A CALLING THAT IS BORN MORE OF THE HEART THAN OF THE MIND. AND EVERY POLICE OFFICER I'VE EVER SPOKEN TO ABOUT WHY THEY SERVE HAS MADE IT CLEAR, YOU SERVE BECAUSE YOU LOVE THIS COUNTRY. YOU LOVE YOUR CITY. YOU LOVE THIS STATE. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ARIZONA AND AMERICA OLIVIA RIGHT BACK. , LOVE YOU RIGHT BACK. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, WE MAY COME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS BUT WE ARE UNITED IN OUR DESIRE TO SHARE PEACE. YOU ARE THE INSTRUMENT OF SECURING THAT FOR EVERY AMERICAN, OF EVERY BACKGROUND AND EVERY WALK OF LIFE. SO FOR ALL YOU DO ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL NATION, I PROMISE YOU THAT WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK. THIS PRESIDENT, THIS VICE PRESIDENT, THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. BECAUSE WE ARE ALL GRATEFUL, GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU DO. IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETIMES I REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT ALL OF MY HEROES WEAR UNIFORMS. NOT ON THE GRIDIRON, NOT ON THE HARDCOURT, BUT WEAR THE UNIFORMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, WEAR THE UNIFORM OF OUR ARMED FORCES. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY, WE WOULD DRIVE TO CHICAGO TO MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE, AND I GOT TO SEE MY UNCLE. HE WOULD DRESS OUT EVERY DAY THAT WE WERE THERE. WHEN HE WOULD COME WALKING OUT OF HIS BEDROOM WEARING THAT CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT UNIFORM, THAT SHINY LEATHER BELT, THE SIDEARM, BADGE ON HIS CHEST, IT MADE ME PROUD. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU THAT WEARS THE UNIFORM, BUT TELL YOUR FAMILIES WE ARE JUST AS GRATEFUL TO THEM, BECAUSE I WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WEAR THAT UNIFORM, BUT I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE A MEMBER OF A FAMILY THAT DOES. AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR FAMILIES, FOR THE LOVE AND SUPPORT THAT THEY GIVE YOU AS YOU SERVE. ON BEHALF OF YOUR PRESIDENT AND ALL OF THE GRATEFUL AMERICAN PEOPLE, I'M HERE TO SAY THANKS. AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE GRATITUDE AND RESPECT OF THIS NATION. YOU SEE IT WHEN YOU ARE WALKING THE BEAT, WHEN YOU STOP TO GET A CUP OF COFFEE, WHEN YOU BUMP INTO PEOPLE AT THE GROCERY STORE, THE CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE OR YOUR PLACE OF WORSHIP. PEOPLE SHOW YOU THAT RESPECT. I KNOW THAT YOU FEEL IT EVERY DAY. DESPITE WHAT HAPPENS IN PUBLIC DEBATE OR ON THE AIRWAVES OF TELEVISION, I KNOW HER ON THE STREETS OF TUCSON AND ALL ACROSS ARIZONA, YOU FEEL THE GRATITUDE. I ALSO HOPE YOU FEEL ONE OTHER THING. I HOPE AS YOU GO OUT THE DOOR IN THE MORNING, I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT I BELIEVE WITH ALL OF MY HEART THAT YOU ARE CARRIED INTO SERVICE EVERY DAY BY THE PRAYERS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO PRAY FOR YOU, PRAY FOR YOUR SAFETY IN PRAY FOR YOUR SERVICE EVERY SINGLE DAY , AND PRAY FOR YOUR SERVICE EVERY SINGLE DAY. THIS IS THE NATION OF FAITH. I HEAR PEOPLE SPEAK ABOUT IT EVERYWHERE I GO, AND I NEVER WANT YOU TO DOUBT IT. WHEN YOU PUT ON THE UNIFORM YOU DO NOT GO ALONE, YOU GO WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF YOUR PRESIDENT, THE CONFIDENCE OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU SERVE. I BELIEVE YOU ALSO GO WITH THE GRACE OF GOD. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT BEAR GREAT RESPONSE ABILITY, IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN TRUE , RESPONSIBILITY, HAS ALWAYS BEEN TRUE. THE BIBLE REMINDS US THERE IS NO AUTHORITY BUT WHICH GOD HAS ESTABLISHED, AND EACH ONE OF YOU THAT PROTECTS AND DESERVES, OR AS THE GOOD BOOK SAYS, SERVICE FOR GOOD, DO NOT BEAR THE SWORD IN VAIN. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT TRUTH, THEY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS THAT YOU TAKE AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU DO. ON THEIR BEHALF, AND ON OUR BEHALF, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TODAY. IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE BACK IN ARIZONA. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TO SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TO SUPPORT SENATOR MCSALLY. AND I KNOW, JUST SEEING THE ENTHUSIASM IN THIS ROOM, IF WE DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY, IN ARIZONA AND ACROSS AMERICA, WE WILL WIN A GREAT VICTORY FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO REELECT THAT SENATOR TO A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY, AND WE WILL ELECT A NEW REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WITH TIFFANY AND BRANDON. AND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS, WE WILL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. WE WILL MAKE ARIZONA MORE PROSPEROUS THAN EVER BEFORE. WE WILL MAKE ARIZONA SAFER THAN EVER BEFORE. AND TO BORROW A PHRASE, 'WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AGAIN.' THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?474599-1/cops-trump-event-arizona	At a &ldquo;Cops for Trump&rdquo; event in Tucson, Arizona, Vice President Mike Pence accepted the Arizona Police Association&rsquo;s endorsement of President Trump&rsquo;s reelection.

REYNOLDS: LET ME START BY SAYING THANK YOU TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE. I KNOW IT HAS BEEN A VERY TRYING WEEK ON TOP OF SOME VERY TRYING YEARS. I APPRECIATE THE VICE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM BEING HERE, TAKING TIME TO MEET WITH OUR IOWA FARMERS WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE SEVERE WEATHER WE HAVE EXPERIENCED. I SPENT THE LAST TWO DAYS SURVEYING, AND IT IS DEVASTATING AND WIDESPREAD. FROM FLATTENED CORNFIELDS TO DESTROYED GRAIN BINS AND STRUCTURES, IT IS ANOTHER HUGE BLOW TO IOWA FARMERS. EARLY AND I WILL STRESS EARLY ESTIMATES SHOW AT LEAST 10 MILLION CROP ACRES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED, HALF OF OUR CROPLAND. THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE STRUCTURES AND STORAGE ISSUES WE HAVE MOVING FORWARD. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE WITHOUT POWER. AT ITS PEAK WE HAD 550,000 HOUSEHOLDS THAT DID NOT HAVE POWER, INCLUDING 97% OF WHEN COUNTY. BUT, THROUGHOUT THE DEVASTATION, THE RESILIENCE AND THE DETERMINATION OF IOWANS CONTINUES TO SHOW THROUGH. FIRST RESPONDERS, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT , MANAGERS SPRING TO ACTION. UTILITY WORKERS FROM AROUND IOWA AND AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE WORKING 24/7 TO RESTORE POWER. MID AM HAD 500 RESOURCES ON THE SITE. ALLIANCE HAS TEAMS AS WELL. PEOPLE ARE OPENING THEIR HOMES TO THOSE WITHOUT POWER AND FOOD. I WAS TOURING A FARM YESTERDAY. WE HAD NOT EATEN ALL DAY. I SAID WHERE IS THE NEAREST GAS STATION? HE SAID, HEY, I CAN FIRE UP THE GRILL AND WE WILL FIX YOU SUPPER BEFORE YOU LEAVE. I SAID, THAT IS IOWA. [APPLAUSE] FARMERS ARE BUSY ASSESSING THEIR FIELDS AND WORKING TO SALVAGE THEIR CROPS. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU WE HAVE A STRONG PARTNER IN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE. I SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT ON TUESDAY. HE CALLED TO FIND OUT WHAT THE DEVASTATION WAS, TO LET US KNOW WE HAVE HIS FULL SUPPORT AND THE SUPPORT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. I AM PRESCIENT , I APPRECIATE THEIR UNENDING COMMITMENT TO IOWA. I AM ALSO EXTREMELY THANKFUL TO HAVE OUR SENATORS, SENATOR JONI ERNST, IN WASHINGTON. SHE IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO EMBODIES THE STRENGTH AND THE DETERMINATION OF IOWA. WHETHER SHE IS HELPING IOWANS WITH COVID-19, TRADE, PROTECTING THE BIOFUEL INDUSTRY, OR HER RESPONSE TO DISASTER RECOVERY, WE ARE SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE A FIGHTER LIKE JONI. IOWA'S FARMERS IN SMALL TOWNS COULD NOT HAVE A MORE FAITHFUL FRIEND THAN HER AND A STRONGER ADVOCATE ON YOUR BEHALF. IT IS MY GREAT HONOR AND PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE IOWA'S AMAZING JUNIOR SENDER , SENATOR AND MY GOOD FRIEND SENATOR ERNST. [APPLAUSE] I APPRECIATE YOU SO MUCH. JUST AS THE GOVERNOR SAID, PRAYERS GO OUT TO EVERYONE THAT HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THESE LATEST STORMS IN IOWA. I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT AND SEE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. I WAS OUT EARLIER TODAY. I WILL BE OUT AGAIN TOMORROW MORNING. GOD BLESS THEM. WE WANT THEM TO STAY SAFE AND MAKE IT THROUGH THIS, AND THEY WILL. WE ARE IOWA STRONG AND WE ARE IOWA RESILIENT. AGAIN, LET US FOCUS ON RIGHT HERE AND NOW THOUGH. WHAT WE HAVE GOING ON. IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. I SEE A LOT OF FRIENDS IN THE CROWD, AND I AM SO THANKFUL FOR YOU. AND I AM THANKFUL TO BE HERE WITH MY FRIEND MIKE PENCE. WE WILL HEAR FROM HIM IN JUST A SECOND. [APPLAUSE] THE VICE PRESIDENT IS FROM ANOTHER I STATE, INDIANA, BUT WE WILL FORGIVE HIM. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, HE LOVES FARMERS. BEING THE GOVERNOR OF INDIANA, HE LOVES FARMERS AND HE REALLY GETS IT. I AM JONI ERNST. I DON'T WANT YOUR FORGIVENESS. NOVEMBER 3 IS COMING QUICKLY. [APPLAUSE] BUT I WAS RAISED ON A SMALL FARM IN SOUTHWEST IOWA AND I AM SO PROUD OF THAT. I STILL CALL MONTGOMERY COUNTY HOME. THE FOLKS BACK HOME, REALLY A COMMUNITY THAT RAISED ME. MY FOLKS INSTILLED VALUES, HARD WORK, YOU NAME IT, IN ME, THAT ALL OF US FARM KIDS HAVE. I DID WORK MY WAY THROUGH COLLEGE, IOWA STATE GRADUATE. [APPLAUSE] AND I HAVE DEDICATED MY LIFE TO SERVING IOWANS AND OUR GREAT COUNTRY. I HAVE SERVED AS COUNTY AUDITOR FOR MICAH MURRAY COUNTY. I HAVE SERVED , FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY. I HAVE SERVED IN THE NATIONAL GUARD. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I HAVE SERVED AS A STATE SENATOR REPRESENTING SOUTHWEST IOWA. AND NOW THE GREAT HONOR AS THE UNITED STATES SENATOR. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS DESCRIBE WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. WE HAVE TWO ROADS. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT CHOOSING A DIRECTION FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND AHEAD OF US, WE HAVE THOSE ROADS. ON ONE HAND WE HAVE THE ROAD OF FREEDOM, PROSPERITY, AND JOINT. SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD ROAD TO ME. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE A ROAD OF THE RADICAL LEFT. ON THAT ROAD IS PAVED BY THOSE RADICAL ENVIRONMENTALIST POLICIES THAT ARE SO DETRIMENTAL TO IOWA AGRICULTURE. THEY ARE PAVED WITH ABORTION ON DEMAND, WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT ROLLBACKS THAT NANCY PELOSI HAS BEEN PROPOSING. AND OF COURSE THE HOPES AND DREAMS OF EVERY COASTAL ELITE. THAT IS THE OTHER ROAD. YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO CHOOSE THAT FIRST ROAD AND THAT IS THE ROAD OF PROSPERITY, OF FREEDOM, AND OF CHOICE. I HOPE YOU WILL TAKE THAT ROAD WITH ME. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS THE ROAD I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR. I KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR THAT. THIS IS THE ROAD THAT DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE ARE FIGHTING FOR AS WELL. ARE WE GOING TO SUPPORT THEM? [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, THEY UNDERSTAND THAT RIGHT HERE IN IOWA, OUR AMERICAN DREAM IS STILL ALIVE AND STILL DOING WELL BECAUSE WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THAT RIGHT HERE IN THE HEARTLAND. FOR ALL OF OUR FARMERS OUT THERE, ANYBODY INVOLVED IN AGRICULTURE? [APPLAUSE] THAT'S MOST OF YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ON THAT SMALL FARM I WAS RAISED ON AND I THINK SOME OF YOU WILL HAVE SOME OF THIS , WILL HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE, TOO, I GREW UP AROUND HOGS. YOU SAW MY ADS. WE WERE TAUGHT TO WORK WITH OUR HANDS, TO CLEAN THE STALLS, SHOVELING WITH A NOW CALL ORGANIC FERTILIZER, WHATEVER THE LEFT WANT TO CALL IT TODAY. WE WORKED REALLY HARD. THAT REALLY DID SHAPE WHO I AM TODAY. IN VERY PROFOUND WAYS, UNDERSTANDING THAT EVERY JOB IS WORTH DOING AREA WE ARE FEEDING AND FUELING A NATION. RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF IOWA. KUDOS TO ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. [APPLAUSE] IT IS EASY TO GIVE CHEAP TALK ABOUT AGRICULTURE. THERE ARE SOME ENGAGED IN THIS RACE LIKE MY OPPONENT, THERESA GREENFIELD, THAT IS OFFERING UP A LOT OF CHEAP TALK. ABOUT AGRICULTURE. THOSE THAT ARE ENGAGED IN IT KNOW THAT IT IS 24/7. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GET A LITTLE DIRTY AND GET IN THE MUD, RIGHT? THAT'S A LOT LIKE POLITICS. BUT WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR THIS. AND I KNOW OUR FARMERS WILL NEVER FORGET HOW BAD BARACK OBAMA WAS FOR FARMERS. THINK BACK. THINK BACK. WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES. WHAT AN OVERREACHING, OVERBURDENED SOME REGULATION THAT WAS ON AGRICULTURE. ON FARMERS AND RANCHERS. AND OF COURSE, JOE BIDEN AND THERESA GREENFIELD ARE HIDING. THE CATCH PHRASE FOR THERESA GREENFIELD RIGHT NOW IS HIDING WITH BIDEN. SHE IS HIDING WITH BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] I'M WONDERING IF JOE BIDEN AND THERESA GREENFIELD ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF THEIR BASEMENTS LONG ENOUGH TO SAY WHETHER THEY SUPPORT A PLAN LIKE BARACK OBAMA DID THAT WOULD REGULATE MOST OF IOWA'S CROPLAND. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR AN ANSWER. AT LEAST ONE ANSWER FROM THERESA GREENFIELD. THE DEMOCRATS IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE GOTTEN IN LOCKSTEP WITH THE PLAN CALLED THE GREEN NEW. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF THAT? [BOOING] NO GREEN NEW DEAL. IT IS A ROTTEN DEAL FOR FARMERS. TOGETHER ALONGSIDE OUR FARMERS AND OUR PRODUCERS, WE HAVE FOUGHT DAY IN AND DAY OUT FOR IOWA'S FARMERS, OUR AGGIE INDUSTRY, OUR FUELS INDUSTRY. WE HAVE KEPT OUR FARMING ECONOMY STRONG AND EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR FARMERS TO MAKE A LIVING AROUND THE GLOBE. EVEN DURING THIS PANDEMIC. FOLKS, AGAIN, LET'S GO BACK TO THOSE TWO ROADS. THE ONE IS THE ROAD OF FREEDOM, PROSPERITY, AND CHOICE. THE OTHER ONE, I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO GO OVER IT AGAIN. WE DON'T NEED THAT. WE DON'T NEED FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE TO OUR GREAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BECAUSE, FOLKS, WE KEEP GETTING IT RIGHT. FREEDOM, PROSPERITY, AND CHOICE. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED RIGHT HERE. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE SAID IT ONCE, I HAVE SET IT TWICE, I HAVE SAID IT A DOZEN TIMES. THIS IS GOING TO BE A TOUGH ELECTION CYCLE AND WE NEED EVERYONE OUT THERE PARTICIPATING. I AM A FIGHTER. I AM A FIGHTER. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP PRESSING ON THROUGH THE VERY LAST MINUTES AND HOURS OF THIS ELECTION CYCLE. WE HAVE TO HOLD THIS STATE AND WE HAVE TO HOLD THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT IS WHY IT IS SUCH AN HONOR FOR ME TO BE ON THIS STAGE TODAY INTRODUCING A MAN I HAVE KNOWN FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. I AM A GREAT ADMIRER OF THIS GENTLEMAN. HE SERVED IN SOME ANY DIFFERENT CAPACITIES FROM CONGRESS TO GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF INDIANA. HE IS NONE OTHER THAN OUR VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. HE WILL JOIN ME ON THIS STAGE. GIVE A WARM IOWA WELCOME TO OUR VICE PRESIDENT. (music) [APPLAUSE] (music) VICE PRES. PENCE: HELLO, IOWA. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE HAWKEYE STATE. TO GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS, SENATOR JONI ERNST, TO ALL OF THE GREAT AMERICANS GATHERED HERE TODAY, THANK YOU FOR COMING AND BEING PART OF A NATIONAL MOVEMENT. FARMERS AND RANCHERS FOR TRUMP. I WANT TO THANK JONI ERNST FOR THOSE GREAT WORDS AND THANK YOU GOVERNOR. I WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY, BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE STATE OF IOWA IS TRULY BLESSED. THAT A PRINCIPLED CONSERVATIVE WHO HAS SERVED THIS NATION IN UNIFORM AND WHO FIGHTS FOR THE HAWKEYE STATE EVERY SINGLE DAY, SENATOR JONI ERNST. IS A NATIONAL TREASURE. [APPLAUSE] PENCE: I KNOW WE ARE GATHERING AT A TIME OF GREAT PROGRESS, GREAT HOPE. A TIME OF CHOOSING RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. BEFORE I GET STARTED, LET ME TAKE A MOMENT TO ADDRESS EVERY IOAN AND FRANKLY PEOPLE ACROSS THE HEARTLAND OF THIS COUNTRY. THE DERECHO THAT DESTROYED MILLIONS OF ACRES OF CROPS, LEFT IOWANS WITHOUT POWER, AND TRAGICALLY TOOK THE LIVES OF TWO IOWANS. WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS STORM, AS A LIFELONG HOOSIER, I WAS TAKEN ABACK. TO HEAR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STORM. I JUST MET WITH FAMILIES WHO LITERALLY HAVE SEEN VIRTUALLY THEIR ENTIRE CROP WIPED OUT. BUT THEY WERE STANDING STRONG, STANDING TOGETHER. I ASSURED THEM THEY AND ALL OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THIS DERECHO ARE ON THE HEARTS AND IN THE PRAYERS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. LET ME SAY, ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND OUR ADMINISTRATION, I WANT IOWANS TO KNOW WE ARE WITH YOU, WE ARE GOING TO STAY WITH YOU, AND WE WILL WORK WITH YOUR GOVERNOR AND YOUR SENATORS TO MAKE SURE WE BRING IOWA ALL THE WAY BACK. BIGGER AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. I PROMISE. BUT IT REALLY IS GREAT TO BE IN IOWA. FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, THIS PRESIDENT SINCE , STOOD STRONG FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. A PROMISE HE ALWAYS WILL. AS A SON OF THE HEARTLAND, I FEEL RIGHT AT HOME. THAT'S WHY I AM HERE TODAY. I AM HERE BECAUSE IOWA AND AMERICA NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: WHILE YOU ARE AT IT, WE NEED SIX MORE YEARS OF SENATOR JONI ERNST AREA IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. LET ME ALSO SAY, THE PRESIDENT AND I AND SENATOR ERNST AND YOUR GREAT GOVERNOR NEED THE GREAT STATE OF IOWA TO SEND MORE TO WASHINGTON, D.C.. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT TODAY. I KNOW IN THE SUMMERTIME THE IOWA STATE FAIRGROUNDS IS USUALLY A LITTLE BUSIER. BUT THESE ARE NO ORDINARY TIMES. IT IS STILL A JOY TO BE WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY. I AM HERE BECAUSE I STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: WHEN THIS PRESIDENT STANDS UP FOR BUSINESS AND FAMILY AND THE AMERICAN FLAG, I STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WHEN THIS PRESIDENT STANDS UP TO THE RADICAL LEFT AND THEIR SOCIALIST AGENDA, WE STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. AND WHEN THIS PRESIDENT FIGHTS FOR AMERICA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND THOSE WITH THE STRENGTH OF THIS NATION BEGINS WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK THE LAND, WE STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. FOUR YEARS AGO A MOVEMENT WAS BORN. A MOVEMENT OF EVERYDAY AMERICANS FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE. HERE IN IOWA YOU KNEW WE COULD BE STRONG AGAIN. YOU KNEW WE COULD BE PROSPEROUS AGAIN. YOU SAID YES TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN 2016 AND I KNOW IOWA IS GOING TO SAY YES TO FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. IN 2020. [APPLAUSE] . VICE PRES. PENCE: THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION COULD NOT BE CLEARER. THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER. IN THIS PRESIDENT YOU HAVE A LEADER WHO HAS DONE MORE FOR THIS COUNTRY'S ECONOMY, MORE TO STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY, MORE TO EXTEND THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES AND STRIDENT IN , ENSHRINED IN THE FOUNDING DOCUMENT OF THIS COUNTRY THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN MY LIFETIME AREA THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY YOU CAN DESCRIBE IT. THREE YEARS OF ACTION. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: IT HAS BEEN THREE YEARS OF RESULTS. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: IT HAS BEEN THREE YEARS OF PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT. BUT WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED, IOWA. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THINK ABOUT IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS KEPT EVERY PROMISE HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA AND THEN SOME. AND THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE. I MUST TELL YOU, IT IS THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE TO BE YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, THE HIGHEST TITLE I WILL EVER HOLD. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: AND AS THE PROUD FATHER OF A UNITED STATES MARINE AND THE FATHER-IN-LAW OF A UNITED STATES NAVY PILOT, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE WITH A PRESIDENT WHO HAS REBUILT THE MILITARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE MADE OUR STRONGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD STRONGER. THIS PRESIDENT CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR WORKING FAMILIES, SMALL BUSINESSES, AND FAMILY FARM, AND HE HAS CUT MORE REDTAPE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS CREATED MORE THAN 7 MILLION JOBS ACROSS THIS NATION. 2 MILLION AMERICANS WERE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY. 7 MILLION AMERICANS WERE ABLE TO LEAVE FOOD STAMPS BEHIND AND PURSUE THEIR DREAMS. THIS PRESIDENT AND OUR ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF IT ALWAYS PUT FAMILY, FARMERS, AND RANCHERS FIRST. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: WE DID. AND THOSE TAX CUTS, WE ELIMINATED THE ESTATE TAX FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY FAMILY FARM. DEATH IS NO LONGER A TAXABLE OFFENSE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: BEING FROM THE HEARTLAND, THIS PRESIDENT ALLOWED FOR IMMEDIATE EXPENSING OF EQUIPMENT. WE MADE GREAT PROGRESS. OUR ECONOMY WAS GROWING AS NEVER BEFORE. IN THREE SHORT LEADERS , SHORT YEARS, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OUR ALLIES LIKE JONI ERNST, WORKED TOGETHER TO CREATE THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND THEN THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC STRUCK OUR NATION FROM CHINA. WE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH A CHALLENGING TIME. EARLY IN THIS PANDEMIC, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAW THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SHINE FORTH. THIS PRESIDENT MARSHALL DID NOT ONLY A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE, BUT A WHOLE OF AMERICA RESPONSE. AMERICA HAS DONE MORE TESTING THE CORONAVIRUS THAN ANY NATION ON EARTH BY FAR. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: AT THE PRESIDENT'S DIRECTION, OUR TASK FORCE ARRANGED FOR THE MANUFACTURE AND DELIVERY OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO ALL OF THE INCREDIBLE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND HOSPITALS ACROSS THIS NATION. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AROUND-THE-CLOCK SINCE FEBRUARY THIS YEAR DEVELOPING NEW THERAPEUTIC, MEDICINES THAT ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY AVAILABLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND I'M PROUD TO SAY I BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE A VACCINE FOR THE CORONAVIRUS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. ONLY IN AMERICA. ONLY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO. WE ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY. TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE WITH THE HELP OF OTHERS FIRST. TO SAVE LIVES. I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF IOWA WILL DO AS YOU HAVE DONE ALL ALONG. PUT THE HEALTH OF OTHERS FIRST. NOT A DAY HAS GONE BY SINCE THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME TO LEAVE THE TASK FORCE WE HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF FAMILIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED LOSS. TODAY I ENCOURAGE YOUR PRAYERS FOR THE MORE THAN 160,000 AMERICAN FAMILIES THAT HAVE LOST LOVED ONES INCLUDING HERE IN IOWA. OUR HEARTS ARE ALSO FULL OF GRATITUDE FOR THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN SAVED BY THE INCREDIBLE FIRST RESPONDERS, DOCTORS, NURSES, AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS ACROSS THIS NATION. THEIR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF HEROIC. AND YOU HAVE OUR THANKS. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: LET ME ALSO SAY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I COULD NOT BE MORE GRATEFUL FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY LEADERSHIP AND CHARACTER OF GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS. SHE HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB LEADING THIS STATE THROUGH CHALLENGING TIMES AND GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS. BRINGING IOWA ALL THE WAY BACK. AND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS COMING BACK. AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, OUR ECONOMY HAD LOST 22 MILLION JOBS. BECAUSE OF THAT SOLID FOUNDATION THAT WE POURED IN THOSE FIRST THREE YEARS, OF LESS TAXES, MORE FREE AND FAIR TRADE, MORE AMERICAN ENERGY, AN AMERICAN COMEBACK HAS BEGUN. FROM THAT HEIGHT OF 22 MILLION JOBS LOST, AS OF A SHORT TIME AGO, THIS ECONOMY IS ALREADY ADDING BACK 9.3 MILLION JOBS AND WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. [NO AUDIO] , [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: I WILL MAKE YOU A PROMISE AND THE GOVERNOR KNOWS WE MEAN IT. AS PEOPLE CONTINUE TO CONTEND WITH THIS PANDEMIC, WE WILL NOT REST, WE WILL NOT RELENT, WE WILL SPARE NO EXPENSE AND NO EFFORT UNTIL IOWA AND AMERICA PUT THE CORONAVIRUS IN THE PAST AND WE BRING AMERICA ALL THE WAY BACK. WE OPEN UP AMERICA AND OPEN UP AMERICA'S SCHOOLS. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: TO DO THAT WE WILL DO OUR PART, BUT TO BRING AMERICA BACK, WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 2[APPLAUSE] WITH THIS PRESIDENT, THIS ADMINISTRATION BEGINS WITH FARMERS AND RANCHERS. TO BRING AMERICA ALL THE WAY BACK WE WILL KEEP FIGHTING FOR AMERICA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. THIS PRESIDENT, I MENTIONED BEFORE, HAS ALREADY NOT JUST CUT TAXES FOR FAMILY FARMS AND RANCHES, BUT THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN BUSY ROLLING BACK RED TAPE AT A RECORD LEVEL. PRESIDENT TRUMP AT SIGN MORE BILLS CUTTING FEDERAL REDTAPE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. AS SENATOR ERNST REFLECTED , AND I WAS THERE WHEN HE SIGNED IT , HE SIGNED A MEASURE TO ENSURE FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY. WE REPEALED THE WATERS OF THE USA ROLE AND RESTORED PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS. HERE IN IOWA AND ACROSS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] WHERE PAST ADMINISTRATIONS TURNED THEIR BACK ON FARMERS AND ETHANOL PRODUCERS, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD THE PEOPLE OF IOWA THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL EXPAND INTO ALL MARKETS, AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE. LAST YEAR THE PRESIDENT TRAVELED TO COUNCIL BLUFFS AND ANNOUNCED E15 IS AVAILABLE YEAR-ROUND. PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. [APPLAUSE] THE TRUTH IS AFTER DECADES OF BEING HELD BACK, AMERICA IS A NET EXPORTER OF ENERGY AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 75 YEARS, AND WE WILL FIGHT TO EXPAND ETHANOL AS A PART OF AMERICA'S VITAL ENERGY INDUSTRY. OUR FUTURE OF INDEPENDENT AND DOMINANCE, WE ARE SETTING RECORDS EVERY DAY. WITH STRONG LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR JONI ERNST, AND STRONG SENSE OF OLD AND UNWAVERING CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY, THIS PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT ON RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARDS THAT ENSURES A 15 BILLION GALLON ETHANOL BLENDED INTO THE FUEL SUPPLY IN 2020. I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU IN IOWA THE IMPACT NASA HAD ON COMMUNITIES AND MANUFACTURING IN THIS COUNTRY. IN 2016 WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND I WERE COMING TO THE STATE, HE SAID WHEN IT COMES TO NAFTA, WE COULD DO BETTER. HE SAID WE WOULD RENEW OUR TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO AND CANADA. SOME PEOPLE SAID IT COULD NOT BE DONE. I WATCHED HIM DO IT. HE ROLLED HIS SLEEVES UP, AND A MAN WHO WROTE ""PART OF THE DEAL"" GOT A GREAT DEAL FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND THE USMCA IS THE LAW OF THE LAND. [APPLAUSE] FOR IOWA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS, IN 2018 FARMERS AND RANCHERS EXPORTED $6 BILLION WORTH OF GOODS TO CANADA AND MEXICO. CANADA HAS AGREED TO EXPAND MARKET ACCESS FOR AMERICAN DAIRY, EGGS, POULTRY. WE THINK WE WILL SELL $2.2 BILLION MORE IN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS TO CANADA AND MEXICO ALONE. THAT INCLUDES $3 MILLION IN DAIRY EXPORTS IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS. USMCA IS A WIN FOR IOWA, A WIN FOR THE HEARTLAND AND AMERICA'S FARMERS. [APPLAUSE] WE THINK EXPERTS TELL US IT WILL CREATE 600,000 JOBS AND ADD $250 BILLION TO THE ECONOMY OUT OF THE GATE. IT IS INCREDIBLE. WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE, BEFORE THE PRESIDENT TOOK OFFICE, HE MADE IT CLEAR THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER TO CHINA WAS OVER. WE WERE GOING TO FIGHT FOR AMERICAN JOBS, AMERICAN FARMERS, AMERICAN WORKERS. [APPLAUSE] FOR YEARS, ONE ADMINISTRATION AFTER ANOTHER IN BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES STOOD IDLY BY WHILE WE SAW CHINA A MASS AND EXTRAORDINARY TRADE SURPLUS. HALF OF OUR INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEFICIT WHEN WE TOOK OFFICE WAS WITH CHINA ALONE. AT A TIME WHEN CHINA WAS GIVING US LIMITED ACCESS TO WHAT WE MAKE AND GROW IN THIS COUNTRY. $500 BILLION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEFICIT WAS WITH CHINA. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKE CLEAR, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. WE STOOD STRONG, AND FARMERS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY STOOD STRONG . YOU STOOD WITH US AS THE PRESIDENT PUT TARIFFS IN PLACE TO LEVEL A PLAYING FIELD WITH CHINA. THE WAY FARMERS AND RANCHERS STOOD IN THE POCKET FOR THIS PRESIDENT AND FREE AND FAIR TRADE WAS AN INSPIRATION TO THE NATION. YOU HAVE ARTIFACTS. , YOU HAVE OUR THANKS. FARMERS AND RANCHERS UNDERSTAND TO GET THINGS DONE, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A FIRM STAND. BECAUSE OF THE STAND YOU TOOK, THE STAN PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK, IT SEEMS LIKE IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THE PHASE ONE TRADE DEAL, AND WE SECURED $50 BILLION IN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS TO CHINA FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS PROGRESS. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO, AND MOST OF THE TARIFFS ARE STILL THERE, BUT IT IS A BEGINNING. I JUST LEARNED THIS MORNING THAT CORN SALES TO CHINA JUST BROKE ALL RECORDS LAST MONTH. ON JULY 30, THE USDA REPORTED CORN SALES OF 1.9 4 MILLION METRIC TONS TO CHINA, THE LARGEST DAILY SALES TOTAL EVER. [APPLAUSE] IT IS WORKING. THEY ARE BUYING. WE ARE LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. IN JULY, SOYBEANS TO CHINA REACHED 3 MILLION METRIC TONS, THE PERCENT OF U.S. AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS GOING TO CHINA ARE COMPARED WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. TWICE THE SHARE WENT TO CHINA IN 2017. MEN AND WOMEN GATHERED AT THIS FARMERS AND RANCHERS FOR TRUMP RALLY IS WHAT LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE. THAT IS THE LEADERSHIP OF DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] I PROMISE YOU WE WILL CONTINUE TO STAND FIRM WITH CHINA UNTIL WE LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD, NOT JUST FOR AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL BUT AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND AMERICAN WORKERS. UNDER THIS PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTRATION, WE ALWAYS PUT AMERICA FIRST. [APPLAUSE] IT IS AMAZING TO THINK ALL WE HAVE DONE IN THREE AND A HALF YEARS THROUGH EXTRAORDINARY OPPOSITION FROM THE LEFT AND THE DEMOCRATS. AND THROUGH THE MIDST OF A CHALLENGING PANDEMIC. INCREDIBLE AND HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WILLING TO FIGHT EACH AND EVERY DAY. I PROMISE YOU THE GUY I SERVE WITH WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING TO KEEP THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA. [APPLAUSE] YOU DESERVE TO KNOW ALL THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IS AT RISK . MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE ARE PASSING THROUGH A TIME OF TESTING, BUT SOON WE WILL COME TO A TIME FOR CHOOSING. THAT IS SOMETHING THE PEOPLE OF IOWA KNOW WELL. THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER, THE STAKES NEVER HAVE BEEN HIGHER. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE. ABOUT THE CHOICE OUR NATION FACES. YOU CAN TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS. FAMILIES IN IOWA, OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS ON THE BALLOT. THERE ARE THINGS ON THE BALLOT MORE FUNDAMENTAL. AND MORE FOUNDATIONAL TO OUR COUNTRY. I THINK THIS COMING ELECTION, THE CHOICE IS NOT WHETHER AMERICA WILL BE MORE CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL, WHETHER AMERICA WILL BE MORE DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN, I THINK THE CHOICE IS WHETHER AMERICA REMAINS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION IS WHETHER WE LEAVE A COUNTRY GROUNDED IN OUR HIGHEST IDEALS OF FREEDOM, FREE MARKETS, THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO LIFE AND LIBERTY, OR WHETHER WE BELIEVE TORTURING GRANDCHILDREN A COUNTRY THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING ELSE. WE STAND AT A CROSSROADS OF FREEDOM. BEFORE US LIVE TWO PATHS, ONE BASED ON THE DIGNITY AND WORTH OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL, AND THE OTHER ON THE GROWING CONTROL OF THE STATE. ONE LEADS TO GREATER FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY AMERICAN REGARDLESS OF RACE OR CREED OR COLOR. THE OTHER LEADS INEXORABLY TO SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. MAKE NO MISTAKE, JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS WILL SET AMERICA ON A PATH OF SOCIALISM AND DECLINE, AND WE WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP SET OUR NATION ON FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY, BUT IT IS AMAZING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR AGENDA. IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC, JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS WILL RAISE TAXES BY $4 TRILLION. THAT IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE TAX INCREASE THAT HILLARY CLINTON NEVER PROPOSED. BY CONTRAST, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THE LARGEST TAX CUTS AND TAX REFORM IN AMERICAN HISTORY, AND WE WILL KEEP DELIVERING TAX RELIEF TO WORKING AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS WILL BURY THE ECONOMY UNDER MORE REGULATION AND BUREAUCRACY. THE CALIFORNIA SENATOR HE NAMED AS HIS RUNNING MATE THIS WEEK SAID DURING HER SHORT CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT THAT AMERICANS NEEDED TO BE EDUCATED ABOUT THE EFFECT OF OUR EATING HABITS ON OUR ENVIRONMENT. SENATOR HARRIS SAID SHE WOULD CHANGE THE DIETARY GUIDELINES OF THIS COUNTRY TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF RED MEAT AMERICANS CAN EAT. I HAVE RED MEAT FOR YOU. WE WILL NOT LET JOE BIDEN AND, LET HARRIS CUT AMERICA'S MEAT. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS HAVE A PLAN TO ABOLISH FOSSIL FUELS. HE WANTS TO REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD AND IMPLEMENT HIS OWN VERSION OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL. I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU THESE RADICAL LEFT POLICIES WOULD DEVASTATE AMERICA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS. BY CONTRAST, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS PUT AN ENERGY STRATEGY ON THE TABLE THAT IS DRIVING IN AMERICAN ENERGY RENAISSANCE, AND WE ARE EXPORTING ENERGY TO THE WORLD, AND WE WILL KEEP EXPANDING. [APPLAUSE] THE CHOICE IS NOT JUST CLEAR AT HOME ON ISSUES THAT THERE DIRECTLY ON OUR LIVELIHOOD. IT IS A CONTRAST OF LEADERSHIP ON THE WORLD STAGE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO REMEMBER JOE BIDEN WAS A LEADING VOICE OF APPEASEMENT TOWARD IRAN AND IN SUPPORT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT US OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. GENERAL SOLEMANI IS GONE. [APPLAUSE] FOUR PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS MADE PROMISES, IT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO KEPT HIS PROMISE WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. [APPLAUSE] I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HEARD ABOUT IT, THIS MORNING IN THE OVAL OFFICE, THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 25 YEARS A LEADING ARAB NATION HAS NORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH THE STATE OF ISRAEL. THE UAE IS RECOGNIZING ISRAEL. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS HISTORY, AND THAT IS LEADERSHIP. THIS PRESIDENT HAS STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AND UP YOUR ENEMIES. CLOSER TO HOME HE HAS STOOD WITH THE MANY WOMEN WHO SERVE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EVERY DAY, AND WE ALWAYS WILL. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I KNOW WHAT THE PEOPLE OF IOWA KNOW, MANY WOMEN WHO SERVE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE THE BEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN ACTUALLY SAID HE BELIEVES AMERICA IS IN HIS WORDS SYSTEMICALLY RACIST. AND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS AN IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST MINORITIES. WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS ASKED IF HE WOULD CUT FUNDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, HE SAID YES, ABSOLUTELY. LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR. ON BEHALF OF THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS ADMINISTRATION, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DEFUND THE POLICE, NOT NOW, NOT EVER. [APPLAUSE] IT IS ABOUT SECURITY AT HOME AND ABROAD, ABOUT PROSPERITY, BUT ULTIMATELY THE RULE OF LAW. WHEN IT COMES TO THE RULE OF LAW, WE KNOW JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS WILL APPOINT ACTIVIST JUDGES TO OUR COURTS WHO WILL LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH. BY CONTRAST, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALREADY APPOINTED MORE THAN 200 FEDERAL JUDGES TO OUR COURTS AT EVERY LEVEL, AND THEY ARE ALL CONSERVATIVES WHO WILL UPHOLD THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES IN OUR CONSTITUTION LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THE FREEDOM OF STATES, AND THE SECOND AMENDED RIGHT TO KEEP AND THEIR ARMS. , BEAR ARMS. [APPLAUSE] NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STALWART SUPPORT OF IOWA'S TWO GREAT SENATORS. JOIN ME IN THANKING SENATOR JONI ERNST AND SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY FOR STANDING STRONG. [APPLAUSE] THROUGHOUT IT ALL, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE AS VICE PRESIDENT TO THE MOST PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] WITH AN ELECTION 80 DAYS AWAY, WE HAVE WORKED TO DO TO CARRY OUR MESSAGE FORWARD. DESPITE ALL THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE, INCLUDING TWO JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT, A FEW RECENT DECISIONS REMIND US WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO. LIKE THAT 5-4 DECISION THAT STRUCK DOWN A LOUISIANA LAW THAT SIMPLY REQUIRE DOCTORS THAT WORK IN ABORTION CLINICS TO HAVE ADMITTING PRIVILEGES AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL, OR LIKE THE 5-4 DECISION THAT SAID THE STATE OF NEVADA CAN IMPOSE GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON A CHAPEL THAN CAESAR'S PALACE. ONE THING IS CLEAR WITH THOSE DECISIONS, WE NEED MORE CONSERVATIVES ON THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] IRANFOR AMERICAN STRENGTH AND AMERICAN JOBS AND LAW AND ORDER AND LIBERTY AND LIFE, WE HAVE TO DECIDE RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW THAT JOE BIDEN WILL NEVER BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE GOING TO REELECT PRESIDENT TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] IOWA, GET READY. BUCKLE UP. IT IS ON. YOU ALL KNOW MORE THAN MOST, WE WILL CARRY THE MESSAGE YOU JUST HEARD ACROSS THE STATE AND THIS NATION. WE NEED ALL OF YOU TO GET READY TO BRING IT LIKE YOU DID FOUR YEARS AGO. BRING THIS ENTHUSIASM, BRING YOUR VOICE AND SUPPORT, TELL YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS ALL WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. AND ALL THIS ADMINISTRATION CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS NATION STRONGER AND MORE PROSPEROUS THAN EVER BEFORE. AND CONTINUE TO BUILD AN AMERICAN FUTURE ON ALL THE IDEALS AND VALUES THAT HAVE MADE THE NATION GREAT IN THE PAST. AS WE OPEN UP AMERICA AGAIN, AS WE BRING OUR NATION BACK, I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO REFLECT THOSE VALUES THAT ARE SO UNIQUE TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS. IT IS SUMMED UP IN ONE WORD, AND THAT IS FAITH. [APPLAUSE] I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND THOUGHT I WILL BE WITH SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. GROWING UP IN THE HEARTLAND AS I DID, WE HAD A CORNFIELD IN MY BACKYARD, 100 HEAD OF CATTLE THAT MY DAD HAD WITH A FEW PARTNERS. I HAVE MUCKED MY SHARE OF STALLS FOR HORSES, BUT I AM INSPIRED BY THE CHARACTER AND FAITH OF MANY WOMEN WHO WORK THE LAND. WHO RAISE THE LIVESTOCK. WHO FEED THE NATION. YOU ARE PEOPLE WHO COME FROM GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE ENDURED GREAT HARDSHIP LIKE IOWA JUST PASSED THROUGH. YOU CAME THROUGH IT WITH A RESILIENCE AND STRENGTH THAT I THINK HAS BEEN A WELLSPRING OF STRENGTH FOR THE NATION. I HAVE ALWAYS MARVELED AT HOW MAY TIMES THE BIBLE TELLS US TO CONSIDER THE FARMER. TO LEARN FROM THE PATIENCE OF A FARMER, AND APPLY THAT TO HER PERSONAL LIVES. AS I GOT UP TODAY, I COULD NOT HELP BUT REMEMBER WHAT ONE GREAT RADIO HOST SAID SO MANY YEARS AGO. WHEN PAUL HARVEY TALKED ABOUT WHY GOD MADE A FARMER. HE SAID ON THE EIGHTH DAY GOD LOOKED DOWN ON HIS PARADISE AND SAID I NEEDED CARETAKER, SO I MADE A FARMER. GOD SAID, I NEED SOMEBODY WILLING TO GET UP AND WORK ALL DAY IN THE FIELDS, MILK COWS, EAT SUPPER, THEN GO TO TOWN AND STATE PAST MIDNIGHT AT A MEETING OF THE SCHOOL BOARD, SO GOD MADE A FARMER. GOD HAD TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO GO DOUBLE SPEED TO GET THE HATE IN AHEAD OF THE RING CLOUDS , HAY IN AHEAD OF THE RING CLOUDS , RAIN CLOUDS. GOD MADE A FARMER. GOD SAID, I NEED SOME STRONG ENOUGH TO CLEAR TREES AND GENTLE ENOUGH TO TAME THE LANDS. WHO WILL STOP HIS MOWER AND SPLINT THE BROKEN LEG OF A MEADOWLARK. SO GOD MADE A FARMER. SOMEBODY TO SEED, WEED, FEED, PLOW, PLANT, AND REPLENISH AND FINISH A HARD WEEKS WORK WITH A DRIVE TO CHURCH. SOMEBODY WHO WOULD BAIL A FAMILY TOGETHER. THE SOFT STRONG BONDS OF SHARING, WHO WOULD LAUGH AND REPLY WITH SMILING EYES. WHEN A SON SAYS HE WANTS TO SPEND HIS LIFE DOING WHAT DAD DOES. GOD MADE A FARMER. I THINK GOD MADE A FARMER AND IN SO DOING MADE AMERICA STRONGER. THAT WILL ALWAYS BE TRUE. [APPLAUSE] WHEN SO MUCH IS ON THE LINE, WHEN WE HAVE SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION, I ASK YOU TO DRAW ON THAT WELLSPRING OF STRENGTH. UNDERSTAND LEADERS IN YOUR COMMUNITY, PEOPLE RESPECT YOU NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DO BUT BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO UNVEIL YOURSELF OF THAT STRENGTH. IF YOU ARE INCLINED TO ABOUT AHEAD AND BEND THE KNEE, WHICH NO FARMER I EVER MET WAS NOT, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT TOO. REMEMBER, IF HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE CALLED BY HIS NAME WILL HUMBLE THEMSELVES AND PRAY, HE WILL DO AS HE HAS DONE THROUGH MUCH MORE CHALLENGING HEAR FROM HEAVEN AND HEAL THIS LAND. [APPLAUSE] THIS ONE NATION UNDER GOD WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I AM CONVINCED IF ALL OF US DO WE NEED TO DO BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER 3, YOUR SUPPORT WITH YOUR EXAMPLE, WITH YOUR VOICE AND YOUR PRAYERS, WE WILL REELECT THIS PRESIDENT FOR FOUR MORE YEARS, AND ELECT TWO NEW GREAT MEMBERS AND A NEW REPUBLICAN MAJORITY. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO BRING AMERICA ALL THE WAY BACK BECAUSE WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS AMERICA.

THREE YEARS OF ACTION. IT HAS BEEN THREE YEARS OF RESULTS. IT HAS BEEN THREE YEARS OF PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT. BUT WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED, IOWA. THINK ABOUT IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS KEPT EVERY PROMISE HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA AND THEN SOME. AND THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE. I MUST TELL YOU, IT IS THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE TO BE YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, THE HIGHEST TITLE I WILL EVER HOLD.

ONLY IN AMERICA. ONLY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO. WE ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY. TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE WITH THE HELP OF OTHERS FIRST. TO SAVE LIVES. I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF IOWA WILL DO AS YOU HAVE DONE ALL ALONG. PUT THE HEALTH OF OTHERS FIRST. NOT A DAY HAS GONE BY SINCE THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME TO LEAVE THE TASK FORCE WE HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF FAMILIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED LOSS. TODAY I ENCOURAGE YOUR PRAYERS FOR THE MORE THAN 160,000 AMERICAN FAMILIES THAT HAVE LOST LOVED ONES INCLUDING HERE IN IOWA. OUR HEARTS ARE ALSO FULL OF GRATITUDE FOR THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN SAVED BY THE INCREDIBLE FIRST RESPONDERS, DOCTORS, NURSES, AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS ACROSS THIS NATION. THEIR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF HEROIC. AND YOU HAVE OUR THANKS. LET ME ALSO SAY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I COULD NOT BE MORE GRATEFUL FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY LEADERSHIP AND CHARACTER OF GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS. SHE HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB LEADING THIS STATE THROUGH CHALLENGING TIMES AND GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS. BRINGING IOWA ALL THE WAY BACK. AND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS COMING BACK. AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, OUR ECONOMY HAD LOST 22 MILLION JOBS. BECAUSE OF THAT SOLID FOUNDATION THAT WE POURED IN THOSE FIRST THREE YEARS, OF LESS TAXES, MORE FREE AND FAIR TRADE, MORE AMERICAN ENERGY, AN AMERICAN COMEBACK HAS BEGUN. FROM THAT HEIGHT OF 22 MILLION JOBS LOST, AS OF A SHORT TIME AGO, THIS ECONOMY IS ALREADY ADDING BACK 9.3 MILLION JOBS AND WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. , I WILL MAKE YOU A PROMISE AND THE GOVERNOR KNOWS WE MEAN IT. AS PEOPLE CONTINUE TO CONTEND WITH THIS PANDEMIC, WE WILL NOT REST, WE WILL NOT RELENT, WE WILL SPARE NO EXPENSE AND NO EFFORT UNTIL IOWA AND AMERICA PUT THE CORONAVIRUS IN THE PAST AND WE BRING AMERICA ALL THE WAY BACK. WE OPEN UP AMERICA AND OPEN UP AMERICA'S SCHOOLS. TO DO THAT WE WILL DO OUR PART, BUT TO BRING AMERICA BACK, WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 2 WITH THIS PRESIDENT, THIS ADMINISTRATION BEGINS WITH FARMERS AND RANCHERS. TO BRING AMERICA ALL THE WAY BACK WE WILL KEEP FIGHTING FOR AMERICA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. THIS PRESIDENT, I MENTIONED BEFORE, HAS ALREADY NOT JUST CUT TAXES FOR FAMILY FARMS AND RANCHES, BUT THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN BUSY ROLLING BACK RED TAPE AT A RECORD LEVEL. PRESIDENT TRUMP AT SIGN MORE BILLS CUTTING FEDERAL REDTAPE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. AS SENATOR ERNST REFLECTED , AND I WAS THERE WHEN HE SIGNED IT , HE SIGNED A MEASURE TO ENSURE FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY. WE REPEALED THE WATERS OF THE USA ROLE AND RESTORED PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS. HERE IN IOWA AND ACROSS AMERICA. WHERE PAST ADMINISTRATIONS TURNED THEIR BACK ON FARMERS AND ETHANOL PRODUCERS, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD THE PEOPLE OF IOWA THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL EXPAND INTO ALL MARKETS, AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE. LAST YEAR THE PRESIDENT TRAVELED TO COUNCIL BLUFFS AND ANNOUNCED E15 IS AVAILABLE YEAR-ROUND. PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. THE TRUTH IS AFTER DECADES OF BEING HELD BACK, AMERICA IS A NET EXPORTER OF ENERGY AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 75 YEARS, AND WE WILL FIGHT TO EXPAND ETHANOL AS A PART OF AMERICA'S VITAL ENERGY INDUSTRY. OUR FUTURE OF INDEPENDENT AND DOMINANCE, WE ARE SETTING RECORDS EVERY DAY. WITH STRONG LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR JONI ERNST, AND STRONG SENSE OF OLD AND UNWAVERING CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY, THIS PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT ON RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARDS THAT ENSURES A 15 BILLION GALLON ETHANOL BLENDED INTO THE FUEL SUPPLY IN 2020. I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU IN IOWA THE IMPACT NASA HAD ON COMMUNITIES AND MANUFACTURING IN THIS COUNTRY. IN 2016 WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND I WERE COMING TO THE STATE, HE SAID WHEN IT COMES TO NAFTA, WE COULD DO BETTER. HE SAID WE WOULD RENEW OUR TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO AND CANADA. SOME PEOPLE SAID IT COULD NOT BE DONE. I WATCHED HIM DO IT. HE ROLLED HIS SLEEVES UP, AND A MAN WHO WROTE 'PART OF THE DEAL' GOT A GREAT DEAL FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND THE USMCA IS THE LAW OF THE LAND. FOR IOWA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS, IN 2018 FARMERS AND RANCHERS EXPORTED $6 BILLION WORTH OF GOODS TO CANADA AND MEXICO. CANADA HAS AGREED TO EXPAND MARKET ACCESS FOR AMERICAN DAIRY, EGGS, POULTRY. WE THINK WE WILL SELL $2.2 BILLION MORE IN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS TO CANADA AND MEXICO ALONE. THAT INCLUDES $3 MILLION IN DAIRY EXPORTS IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS. USMCA IS A WIN FOR IOWA, A WIN FOR THE HEARTLAND AND AMERICA'S FARMERS. WE THINK EXPERTS TELL US IT WILL CREATE 600,000 JOBS AND ADD $250 BILLION TO THE ECONOMY OUT OF THE GATE. IT IS INCREDIBLE. WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE, BEFORE THE PRESIDENT TOOK OFFICE, HE MADE IT CLEAR THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER TO CHINA WAS OVER. WE WERE GOING TO FIGHT FOR AMERICAN JOBS, AMERICAN FARMERS, AMERICAN WORKERS. FOR YEARS, ONE ADMINISTRATION AFTER ANOTHER IN BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES STOOD IDLY BY WHILE WE SAW CHINA A MASS AND EXTRAORDINARY TRADE SURPLUS. HALF OF OUR INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEFICIT WHEN WE TOOK OFFICE WAS WITH CHINA ALONE. AT A TIME WHEN CHINA WAS GIVING US LIMITED ACCESS TO WHAT WE MAKE AND GROW IN THIS COUNTRY. $500 BILLION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEFICIT WAS WITH CHINA. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKE CLEAR, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. WE STOOD STRONG, AND FARMERS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY STOOD STRONG . YOU STOOD WITH US AS THE PRESIDENT PUT TARIFFS IN PLACE TO LEVEL A PLAYING FIELD WITH CHINA. THE WAY FARMERS AND RANCHERS STOOD IN THE POCKET FOR THIS PRESIDENT AND FREE AND FAIR TRADE WAS AN INSPIRATION TO THE NATION. YOU HAVE ARTIFACTS. , YOU HAVE OUR THANKS. FARMERS AND RANCHERS UNDERSTAND TO GET THINGS DONE, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A FIRM STAND. BECAUSE OF THE STAND YOU TOOK, THE STAN PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK, IT SEEMS LIKE IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THE PHASE ONE TRADE DEAL, AND WE SECURED $50 BILLION IN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS TO CHINA FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THAT IS PROGRESS. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO, AND MOST OF THE TARIFFS ARE STILL THERE, BUT IT IS A BEGINNING. I JUST LEARNED THIS MORNING THAT CORN SALES TO CHINA JUST BROKE ALL RECORDS LAST MONTH. ON JULY 30, THE USDA REPORTED CORN SALES OF 1.9 4 MILLION METRIC TONS TO CHINA, THE LARGEST DAILY SALES TOTAL EVER. IT IS WORKING. THEY ARE BUYING. WE ARE LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. IN JULY, SOYBEANS TO CHINA REACHED 3 MILLION METRIC TONS, THE PERCENT OF U.S. AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS GOING TO CHINA ARE COMPARED WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. TWICE THE SHARE WENT TO CHINA IN 2017. MEN AND WOMEN GATHERED AT THIS FARMERS AND RANCHERS FOR TRUMP RALLY IS WHAT LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE. THAT IS THE LEADERSHIP OF DONALD TRUMP. I PROMISE YOU WE WILL CONTINUE TO STAND FIRM WITH CHINA UNTIL WE LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD, NOT JUST FOR AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL BUT AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND AMERICAN WORKERS. UNDER THIS PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTRATION, WE ALWAYS PUT AMERICA FIRST. IT IS AMAZING TO THINK ALL WE HAVE DONE IN THREE AND A HALF YEARS THROUGH EXTRAORDINARY OPPOSITION FROM THE LEFT AND THE DEMOCRATS. AND THROUGH THE MIDST OF A CHALLENGING PANDEMIC. INCREDIBLE AND HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WILLING TO FIGHT EACH AND EVERY DAY. I PROMISE YOU THE GUY I SERVE WITH WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING TO KEEP THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA. YOU DESERVE TO KNOW ALL THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IS AT RISK . MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE ARE PASSING THROUGH A TIME OF TESTING, BUT SOON WE WILL COME TO A TIME FOR CHOOSING. THAT IS SOMETHING THE PEOPLE OF IOWA KNOW WELL. THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER, THE STAKES NEVER HAVE BEEN HIGHER. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE. ABOUT THE CHOICE OUR NATION FACES. YOU CAN TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS. FAMILIES IN IOWA, OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS ON THE BALLOT. THERE ARE THINGS ON THE BALLOT MORE FUNDAMENTAL. AND MORE FOUNDATIONAL TO OUR COUNTRY. I THINK THIS COMING ELECTION, THE CHOICE IS NOT WHETHER AMERICA WILL BE MORE CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL, WHETHER AMERICA WILL BE MORE DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN, I THINK THE CHOICE IS WHETHER AMERICA REMAINS AMERICA. THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION IS WHETHER WE LEAVE A COUNTRY GROUNDED IN OUR HIGHEST IDEALS OF FREEDOM, FREE MARKETS, THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO LIFE AND LIBERTY, OR WHETHER WE BELIEVE TORTURING GRANDCHILDREN A COUNTRY THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING ELSE. WE STAND AT A CROSSROADS OF FREEDOM. BEFORE US LIVE TWO PATHS, ONE BASED ON THE DIGNITY AND WORTH OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL, AND THE OTHER ON THE GROWING CONTROL OF THE STATE. ONE LEADS TO GREATER FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY AMERICAN REGARDLESS OF RACE OR CREED OR COLOR. THE OTHER LEADS INEXORABLY TO SOCIALISM AND DECLINE. MAKE NO MISTAKE, JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS WILL SET AMERICA ON A PATH OF SOCIALISM AND DECLINE, AND WE WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN. PRESIDENT TRUMP SET OUR NATION ON FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY, BUT IT IS AMAZING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR AGENDA. IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC, JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS WILL RAISE TAXES BY $4 TRILLION. THAT IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE TAX INCREASE THAT HILLARY CLINTON NEVER PROPOSED. BY CONTRAST, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THE LARGEST TAX CUTS AND TAX REFORM IN AMERICAN HISTORY, AND WE WILL KEEP DELIVERING TAX RELIEF TO WORKING AMERICANS. JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS WILL BURY THE ECONOMY UNDER MORE REGULATION AND BUREAUCRACY. THE CALIFORNIA SENATOR HE NAMED AS HIS RUNNING MATE THIS WEEK SAID DURING HER SHORT CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT THAT AMERICANS NEEDED TO BE EDUCATED ABOUT THE EFFECT OF OUR EATING HABITS ON OUR ENVIRONMENT. SENATOR HARRIS SAID SHE WOULD CHANGE THE DIETARY GUIDELINES OF THIS COUNTRY TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF RED MEAT AMERICANS CAN EAT. I HAVE RED MEAT FOR YOU. WE WILL NOT LET JOE BIDEN AND, LET HARRIS CUT AMERICA'S MEAT. JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS HAVE A PLAN TO ABOLISH FOSSIL FUELS. HE WANTS TO REJOIN THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD AND IMPLEMENT HIS OWN VERSION OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL. I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU THESE RADICAL LEFT POLICIES WOULD DEVASTATE AMERICA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS. BY CONTRAST, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS PUT AN ENERGY STRATEGY ON THE TABLE THAT IS DRIVING IN AMERICAN ENERGY RENAISSANCE, AND WE ARE EXPORTING ENERGY TO THE WORLD, AND WE WILL KEEP EXPANDING. THE CHOICE IS NOT JUST CLEAR AT HOME ON ISSUES THAT THERE DIRECTLY ON OUR LIVELIHOOD. IT IS A CONTRAST OF LEADERSHIP ON THE WORLD STAGE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO REMEMBER JOE BIDEN WAS A LEADING VOICE OF APPEASEMENT TOWARD IRAN AND IN SUPPORT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT US OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. GENERAL SOLEMANI IS GONE. FOUR PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS MADE PROMISES, IT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO KEPT HIS PROMISE WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HEARD ABOUT IT, THIS MORNING IN THE OVAL OFFICE, THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 25 YEARS A LEADING ARAB NATION HAS NORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH THE STATE OF ISRAEL. THE UAE IS RECOGNIZING ISRAEL. THAT IS HISTORY, AND THAT IS LEADERSHIP. THIS PRESIDENT HAS STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AND UP YOUR ENEMIES. CLOSER TO HOME HE HAS STOOD WITH THE MANY WOMEN WHO SERVE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EVERY DAY, AND WE ALWAYS WILL. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I KNOW WHAT THE PEOPLE OF IOWA KNOW, MANY WOMEN WHO SERVE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE THE BEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. JOE BIDEN ACTUALLY SAID HE BELIEVES AMERICA IS IN HIS WORDS SYSTEMICALLY RACIST. AND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS AN IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST MINORITIES. WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS ASKED IF HE WOULD CUT FUNDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, HE SAID YES, ABSOLUTELY. LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR. ON BEHALF OF THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS ADMINISTRATION, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DEFUND THE POLICE, NOT NOW, NOT EVER. IT IS ABOUT SECURITY AT HOME AND ABROAD, ABOUT PROSPERITY, BUT ULTIMATELY THE RULE OF LAW. WHEN IT COMES TO THE RULE OF LAW, WE KNOW JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS WILL APPOINT ACTIVIST JUDGES TO OUR COURTS WHO WILL LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH. BY CONTRAST, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALREADY APPOINTED MORE THAN 200 FEDERAL JUDGES TO OUR COURTS AT EVERY LEVEL, AND THEY ARE ALL CONSERVATIVES WHO WILL UPHOLD THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES IN OUR CONSTITUTION LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THE FREEDOM OF STATES, AND THE SECOND AMENDED RIGHT TO KEEP AND THEIR ARMS. , BEAR ARMS. NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STALWART SUPPORT OF IOWA'S TWO GREAT SENATORS. JOIN ME IN THANKING SENATOR JONI ERNST AND SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY FOR STANDING STRONG. THROUGHOUT IT ALL, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE AS VICE PRESIDENT TO THE MOST PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WITH AN ELECTION 80 DAYS AWAY, WE HAVE WORKED TO DO TO CARRY OUR MESSAGE FORWARD. DESPITE ALL THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE, INCLUDING TWO JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT, A FEW RECENT DECISIONS REMIND US WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO. LIKE THAT 5-4 DECISION THAT STRUCK DOWN A LOUISIANA LAW THAT SIMPLY REQUIRE DOCTORS THAT WORK IN ABORTION CLINICS TO HAVE ADMITTING PRIVILEGES AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL, OR LIKE THE 5-4 DECISION THAT SAID THE STATE OF NEVADA CAN IMPOSE GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON A CHAPEL THAN CAESAR'S PALACE. ONE THING IS CLEAR WITH THOSE DECISIONS, WE NEED MORE CONSERVATIVES ON THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE NEED FOUR MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IRANFOR AMERICAN STRENGTH AND AMERICAN JOBS AND LAW AND ORDER AND LIBERTY AND LIFE, WE HAVE TO DECIDE RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW THAT JOE BIDEN WILL NEVER BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE GOING TO REELECT PRESIDENT TRUMP. IOWA, GET READY. BUCKLE UP. IT IS ON. YOU ALL KNOW MORE THAN MOST, WE WILL CARRY THE MESSAGE YOU JUST HEARD ACROSS THE STATE AND THIS NATION. WE NEED ALL OF YOU TO GET READY TO BRING IT LIKE YOU DID FOUR YEARS AGO. BRING THIS ENTHUSIASM, BRING YOUR VOICE AND SUPPORT, TELL YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS ALL WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. AND ALL THIS ADMINISTRATION CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS NATION STRONGER AND MORE PROSPEROUS THAN EVER BEFORE. AND CONTINUE TO BUILD AN AMERICAN FUTURE ON ALL THE IDEALS AND VALUES THAT HAVE MADE THE NATION GREAT IN THE PAST. AS WE OPEN UP AMERICA AGAIN, AS WE BRING OUR NATION BACK, I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO REFLECT THOSE VALUES THAT ARE SO UNIQUE TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS. IT IS SUMMED UP IN ONE WORD, AND THAT IS FAITH. I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND THOUGHT I WILL BE WITH SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. GROWING UP IN THE HEARTLAND AS I DID, WE HAD A CORNFIELD IN MY BACKYARD, 100 HEAD OF CATTLE THAT MY DAD HAD WITH A FEW PARTNERS. I HAVE MUCKED MY SHARE OF STALLS FOR HORSES, BUT I AM INSPIRED BY THE CHARACTER AND FAITH OF MANY WOMEN WHO WORK THE LAND. WHO RAISE THE LIVESTOCK. WHO FEED THE NATION. YOU ARE PEOPLE WHO COME FROM GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE ENDURED GREAT HARDSHIP LIKE IOWA JUST PASSED THROUGH. YOU CAME THROUGH IT WITH A RESILIENCE AND STRENGTH THAT I THINK HAS BEEN A WELLSPRING OF STRENGTH FOR THE NATION. I HAVE ALWAYS MARVELED AT HOW MAY TIMES THE BIBLE TELLS US TO CONSIDER THE FARMER. TO LEARN FROM THE PATIENCE OF A FARMER, AND APPLY THAT TO HER PERSONAL LIVES. AS I GOT UP TODAY, I COULD NOT HELP BUT REMEMBER WHAT ONE GREAT RADIO HOST SAID SO MANY YEARS AGO. WHEN PAUL HARVEY TALKED ABOUT WHY GOD MADE A FARMER. HE SAID ON THE EIGHTH DAY GOD LOOKED DOWN ON HIS PARADISE AND SAID I NEEDED CARETAKER, SO I MADE A FARMER. GOD SAID, I NEED SOMEBODY WILLING TO GET UP AND WORK ALL DAY IN THE FIELDS, MILK COWS, EAT SUPPER, THEN GO TO TOWN AND STATE PAST MIDNIGHT AT A MEETING OF THE SCHOOL BOARD, SO GOD MADE A FARMER. GOD HAD TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO GO DOUBLE SPEED TO GET THE HATE IN AHEAD OF THE RING CLOUDS , HAY IN AHEAD OF THE RING CLOUDS , RAIN CLOUDS. GOD MADE A FARMER. GOD SAID, I NEED SOME STRONG ENOUGH TO CLEAR TREES AND GENTLE ENOUGH TO TAME THE LANDS. WHO WILL STOP HIS MOWER AND SPLINT THE BROKEN LEG OF A MEADOWLARK. SO GOD MADE A FARMER. SOMEBODY TO SEED, WEED, FEED, PLOW, PLANT, AND REPLENISH AND FINISH A HARD WEEKS WORK WITH A DRIVE TO CHURCH. SOMEBODY WHO WOULD BAIL A FAMILY TOGETHER. THE SOFT STRONG BONDS OF SHARING, WHO WOULD LAUGH AND REPLY WITH SMILING EYES. WHEN A SON SAYS HE WANTS TO SPEND HIS LIFE DOING WHAT DAD DOES. GOD MADE A FARMER. I THINK GOD MADE A FARMER AND IN SO DOING MADE AMERICA STRONGER. THAT WILL ALWAYS BE TRUE. WHEN SO MUCH IS ON THE LINE, WHEN WE HAVE SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION, I ASK YOU TO DRAW ON THAT WELLSPRING OF STRENGTH. UNDERSTAND LEADERS IN YOUR COMMUNITY, PEOPLE RESPECT YOU NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DO BUT BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO UNVEIL YOURSELF OF THAT STRENGTH. IF YOU ARE INCLINED TO ABOUT AHEAD AND BEND THE KNEE, WHICH NO FARMER I EVER MET WAS NOT, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT TOO. REMEMBER, IF HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE CALLED BY HIS NAME WILL HUMBLE THEMSELVES AND PRAY, HE WILL DO AS HE HAS DONE THROUGH MUCH MORE CHALLENGING HEAR FROM HEAVEN AND HEAL THIS LAND. THIS ONE NATION UNDER GOD WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I AM CONVINCED IF ALL OF US DO WE NEED TO DO BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER 3, YOUR SUPPORT WITH YOUR EXAMPLE, WITH YOUR VOICE AND YOUR PRAYERS, WE WILL REELECT THIS PRESIDENT FOR FOUR MORE YEARS, AND ELECT TWO NEW GREAT MEMBERS AND A NEW REPUBLICAN MAJORITY. WE ARE GOING TO BRING AMERICA ALL THE WAY BACK BECAUSE WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS AMERICA.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?474638-1/vice-president-pence-meets-farmers-des-moines-iowa	Vice President Mike Pence delivered remarks at the Iowa State Fairgrounds to launch a &ldquo;Farmers and Ranchers for Trump&rdquo; coalition in support of President Trump&rsquo;s reelection campaign. He was introduced by Governor Kim Reynolds and Senator Joni Ernst, both Iowa Republicans. During his remarks, the vice president encouraged those in attendance to vote for President Trump&rsquo;s reelection as well as that of Senator Ernst. He also talked about the president&rsquo;s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), who had been named as his running mate earlier in the week. Vice President Pence said the former vice president and Senator Harris were too progressive and would change the course of the nation.	474638-1		
CSPANMP392020161	Mike Pence	2020-09-03	"Vice President Pence Hosts ""Cops for Trump"" Event in North Carolina"	Speech	I want to thank you all for being here and I especially want to thank the cops for Trump that are with us here today. But I'm here for one reason and one reason only. And that is the North Carolina and America need 4 more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. And I can tell you for all the support that we've received around the country and I know I speak for your senator for these great Congress to have the support of men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement means so much to kill me in a challenging time when we see violence overtaking the center of some of our major cities now more than ever the American people are grateful for those who serve on the thin blue line and President Trump and I will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement just as you are standing with us. You know the president was in North Carolina just yesterday and I'm happy to be here today the president was up in Wilmington dedicating the 1st ever American World War 2 heritage it was an epic event but there the president took a moment to say that we will uphold the rule of law and defend the American dream for every child in our land and that's what the men and women of law enforcement do every single day and the truth is the people of North Carolina understood this president's leadership early on and 4 years ago you believe we could be strong again you believe we could be prosperous again the people of North Carolina said yes to President Donald Tin 2016 and I know with the support of all these great men and women in law enforcement that North Carolina is going to say yes to President Donald Trump in 2020. You know the truth is the choice in this election has never been clear stakes have never been higher than President Donald Trump you have a leader. He's committed a long order to liberty and life and the other side we see a Democratic Party that's literally been overtaken by the radical left their abortion is higher taxes socialized medicine abortion on demand open borders and actually advocating cuts in law enforcement at a time of rising violence in our city so we've got to decide right here and right now all across the state of North Carolina that we're going to reelect President Donald Trump for 4 more years we're going to recognize the road to victory starts right on to a backhoe road here in North Carolina. You know this week our president demonstrated his commitment to those of you who serve and protect every day after a very difficult week in can OSHA was constant the president travel traveled there to a city torn asunder businesses destroyed and burned down families displaced He went there to see thanks to the courageous men and women of law enforcement and the National Guard in Wisconsin that stepped up and did their job and I promise you this president this vice president will always stand for Law and Order for every city and every town in every state in America. I like all of you in this freedom loving state President Trump and I will always stand for the right of Americans to peaceful protests but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest burning businesses is not free speech harming innocent civilians and law enforcement is not how Americans express their sentiments. And those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Too many heroes have died defending our freedom for us to allow Americans to strike down each other in our streets we will have law and order in every city in this nation and we will restore law and order for every American of every race and creed and color so help us God. I want to assure you your president knows and his vice president know that the overwhelming majority of men and women who serve in law enforcement are the best people in this country while some in the other party say that law enforcement is the problem we know the law enforcement is the solution but the contrast in this election couldn't be more clear if you have a president who stands without apology for the men and women of law enforcement Joe Biden actually says that America in his words is systemically races and that law enforcement has as he said and I quote an implicit bias he even went on to say that well armed police become the enemy when confronting lawlessness on our streets when Joe Biden was asked whether he would support cutting funding to law enforcement he replied Yes absolutely so let me make you a promise. Under President Donald Trump in our administration we will always stand with the men and women who serve in law enforcement we're not going to defund the police not now not ever. You know for months all we heard all we heard from Joe Biden in the Democratic Party was talk about peaceful protesters as they as they watched businesses and communities in major cities burn but Joe Biden we know got out of his basement this week he went to Pennsylvania after months of staying silent about rioting and looting and violence in the streets of our city Joe Biden said we have to stand against violence in every form it takes but right after he said that he criticized law enforcement he never mentioned the anarchists and the left wing mobs that have been sowing violence in the streets of our major city he never condemned n.t. 5 he never called out his campaign staff or his running mate that actually were raising money to bail out violent criminals and Joe Biden never called out Democrat mayors or Democrat governors who failed to quell the violence in their cities in their state the truth is Joe Biden would double down on the policies that have led to violence in American cities and the hard truth is you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America by contrast from the 1st day of this administration President Trump and I have been standing with the men and women of law enforcement with more resources and more support than ever before. We've made the resources available to fund more than 4000 new police officers through the cops program and in the wake of the murder of George Floyd that took place in Minneapolis Minnesota it was this president who signed an executive order and called on the Congress to work with us to provide more resources to law enforcement for better training and better accountability and in July of this year President Trump announced what week are calling Operation legend a surge of federal law enforcement that's taking place in cities all across this country cities that have experienced enormous surges in violence and crime due to bad government in and motivated by the defunding efforts that were seen by the radical left and supported by their allies in the Democratic Party the reality is we've made progress we've made progress operation legend today has already made more than $1000.00 arrests including 90 homicide suspects and we are going to provide support through Operation legend to restore law and order to cities across this nation. You know Operation legend was actually named after a little. 4 year old African-American boy named legend Tal Afar a Kansas City Missouri legend was actually gunned down in his home while he slept in the middle of the night the night before he had literally build a pillow fort with his dead and he was sleeping in their pillow for when he was struck they rushed him to the hospital but it was too late and little legend tell a pharaoh died of his injuries Well I want to make your promise. It's a promise that I know cops for trauma men and women of law enforcement keep every day we are not going to allow little legend to have died in vain we are going to work every day to make our cities in our nation safe again for our children and our families so help us God. I mean the truth is you all know here in North Carolina with the president and I know that is despite the language of Democrat Party leaders in the radical left we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American neighbors and other minorities and women our city we have done both and we're going to continue to do both for 4 more years this president has supported opportunities educational choice supported record investment in jobs in our inner cities we've supported record investment in historically black colleges and universities in our 1st 3 years we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans with 4 more years the best is yet to come for our African-American families and we're going to do all of that while we support our law enforcement at every level. But what brings me here today and I'll let these extraordinary officers get out of the sun is just to say think and not just thank you for this endorsement 60000 members of the Southern states police benevolent associations support means more to this president and this vice president than I could possibly express Abraham Lincoln said once his only ambition in life was to be a steamed by those who have seemed so to have the support of men and women. Literally put your lives on the line every day means more to us and I could possibly ever express I mean the truth the matter is each one of you. Make it possible every day for the greatest nation on earth to thrive you're what separates us from chaos and makes this nation thrive in these challenging times it's been how you protected and served in the midst of this coronavirus pandemic that's allowing North Carolina and America to recover more every single day. So all make you one more promise. This president and this vice president are Administration this senator and these great members of Congress will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement we will always back to blue. So thank you for your support. So thank you for your support I hope you leave here today with confidence of our support for you I hope all of these courageous law enforcement officers know that when they strap on that side arm in the morning they put on that uniform they walk out of that squad car they go with the confidence of their president whatever you may see in the national debate I believe with all my heart you also go with the support and the prayers of the vast majority of the American people who know that those of you have answered the call to serve in law enforcement side and long ago to count our lives more important than your own you know the good book tells us that. Those who protect and serve our. Servants for good. Do not bear the sword in vain we know what that means we know the risks that entails the work that you do. So on behalf of our president. Our entire ministration. Not just thank you for your support   but more important. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your courageous service. May God bless the men and women who serve in law enforcement here in North Carolina and all across America each and every day. May God bless the people of North Carolina your support I just know we're going to reelect Senator Tom Tillis to a Republican majority in the Senate we're going to reelect Congressman Bishop Walker Hudson and Murphy to a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives and with President Donald Trump in the White House for 4 more years we're going to make America great again. Again. Thank you very much God bless cops for Trump and God bless America.	I want to thank you all for being here and I especially want to thank the cops for Trump that are with us here today.

You know for months all we heard all we heard from Joe Biden in the Democratic Party was talk about peaceful protesters as they as they watched businesses and communities in major cities burn but Joe Biden we know got out of his basement this week he went to Pennsylvania after months of staying silent about rioting and looting and violence in the streets of our city Joe Biden said we have to stand against violence in every form it takes but right after he said that he criticized law enforcement he never mentioned the anarchists and the left wing mobs that have been sowing violence in the streets of our major city he never condemned n.t. 5 he never called out his campaign staff or his running mate that actually were raising money to bail out violent criminals and Joe Biden never called out Democrat mayors or Democrat governors who failed to quell the violence in their cities in their state the truth is Joe Biden would double down on the policies that have led to violence in American cities and the hard truth is you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America by contrast from the 1st day of this administration President Trump and I have been standing with the men and women of law enforcement with more resources and more support than ever before. We've made the resources available to fund more than 4000 new police officers through the cops program and in the wake of the murder of George Floyd that took place in Minneapolis Minnesota it was this president who signed an executive order and called on the Congress to work with us to provide more resources to law enforcement for better training and better accountability and in July of this year President Trump announced what week are calling Operation legend a surge of federal law enforcement that's taking place in cities all across this country cities that have experienced enormous surges in violence and crime due to bad government in and motivated by the defunding efforts that were seen by the radical left and supported by their allies in the Democratic Party the reality is we've made progress we've made progress operation legend today has already made more than $1000.00 arrests including 90 homicide suspects and we are going to provide support through Operation legend to restore law and order to cities across this nation. You know Operation legend was actually named after a little. 4 year old African-American boy named legend Tal Afar a Kansas City Missouri legend was actually gunned down in his home while he slept in the middle of the night the night before he had literally build a pillow fort with his dead and he was sleeping in their pillow for when he was struck they rushed him to the hospital but it was too late and little legend tell a pharaoh died of his injuries Well I want to make your promise. It's a promise that I know cops for trauma men and women of law enforcement keep every day we are not going to allow little legend to have died in vain we are going to work every day to make our cities in our nation safe again for our children and our families so help us God. I mean the truth is you all know here in North Carolina with the president and I know that is despite the language of Democrat Party leaders in the radical left we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American neighbors and other minorities and women our city we have done both and we're going to continue to do both for 4 more years this president has supported opportunities educational choice supported record investment in jobs in our inner cities we've supported record investment in historically black colleges and universities in our 1st 3 years we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans with 4 more years the best is yet to come for our African-American families and we're going to do all of that while we support our law enforcement at every level. But what brings me here today and I'll let these extraordinary officers get out of the sun is just to say think and not just thank you for this endorsement 60000 members of the Southern states police benevolent associations support means more to this president and this vice president than I could possibly express Abraham Lincoln said once his only ambition in life was to be a steamed by those who have seemed so to have the support of men and women. Literally put your lives on the line every day means more to us and I could possibly ever express I mean the truth the matter is each one of you. Make it possible every day for the greatest nation on earth to thrive you're what separates us from chaos and makes this nation thrive in these challenging times it's been how you protected and served in the midst of this coronavirus pandemic that's allowing North Carolina and America to recover more every single day. So all make you one more promise. This president and this vice president are Administration this senator and these great members of Congress will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement we will always back to blue. So thank you for your support. So thank you for your support I hope you leave here today with confidence of our support for you I hope all of these courageous law enforcement officers know that when they strap on that side arm in the morning they put on that uniform they walk out of that squad car they go with the confidence of their president whatever you may see in the national debate I believe with all my heart you also go with the support and the prayers of the vast majority of the American people who know that those of you have answered the call to serve in law enforcement side and long ago to count our lives more important than your own you know the good book tells us that. Those who protect and serve our. Servants for good. Do not bear the sword in vain we know what that means we know the risks that entails the work that you do. So on behalf of our president. Our entire ministration. Not just thank you for your support but more important. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your courageous service. May God bless the men and women who serve in law enforcement here in North Carolina and all across America each and every day. May God bless the people of North Carolina your support I just know we're going to reelect Senator Tom Tillis to a Republican majority in the Senate we're going to reelect Congressman Bishop Walker Hudson and Murphy to a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives and with President Donald Trump in the White House for 4 more years we're going to make America great again. Again. Thank you very much God bless cops for Trump and God bless America.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?475296-1/vice-president-pence-hosts-cops-trump-event-north-carolina	Vice President Pence delivered remarks at a &ldquo;Cops for Trump&rdquo; event held at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina.	475296-1

Are you ready? It is great to be with you all. Congressman Bergman, Congressman Mullin are GOP Chair Laura Cox, John James and all of you have been with us every step of the way. It is great to be back in the Great Lakes State. One Mawr Day to four more years. So that's what I'm talking about. Thank you for that. Wonderful warm welcome. He's gonna be here in about 40 minutes. But would you all would you all join me in? Just thanking a few people? First and foremost, she's a Marine Corps mom. She's been a champion for military families. She's a school teacher and a little Christian school. She's been my wife for 35 years. Would you join me in thanking the greatest second lady of the United States that we've ever had my wife, Karen, fan, I thank you, but Karen and I are here for one reason and one reason only. And that is that Michigan and America need forem or years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Out it's on Michigan, and the road to victory goes right through the Great Lakes State. We need the people of this freedom loving state to do just what you did in 2016. By tomorrow night, we need Michigan to show America that this is Trump Country, but it really is great to be with you all. It really is great. Also, it's great to be here with some good friends of mine and other presidents, in fact, one of whom is the highest ranking combat veteran ever to serve in the Congress of the United States. Now he's one of the strongest voices for our national events. Join me in thanking Congressman Jack Bergman, Will you? Thank you, Jack. It's also great to be here with a man who has served the people of Michigan in the State House, and I've served alongside him, and I could tell you he is one of the strongest allies of our president and our agenda in the United States Congress Congressman John Molinar and let me say what a privilege it is to be here with a man that I got to know over the last couple of years. He's a man of integrity. He's a family man, a West Point graduate, a combat veteran, a businessman and the next senator from the Great state of Michigan. John James. Well, thank you all for being here. I know you're out today. Toe here and see our president. Show your support. But I also know you're here because of all that we accomplished together over the last four years. I mean, think about it. Four years ago, we inherited a military that was hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise, and we witnessed a steady assault on our values. But in three short years we rebuild our military way, revive our economy. We secured our border, supported law enforcement and stood for life, liberty and the Constitution of the United States. You know, after Joe Biden spent the previous eight years trying to tax and spend and bail our way back to a growing economy. President Donald Tcreated the greatest economy in American history on we're doing it Again, Michigan e mean, how about those new GDP numbers? Last week's You check that out 33% growth in the third quarter shattered any previous record. The great American comeback is on on with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. We're gonna bring this economy back bigger and better than ever before, you know, the president said. It was the biggest quarter in the history of our country, not even close. And he and I both know this American comeback is a testament, all of you to the resilience and the strength of the character of the American people. But it's also a tribute to a president and our allies in Congress who created the greatest economy the world has ever seen. That's why it's remarkable to think in the midst of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion. His running mate, Kamala Harris, said on Friday that their quote first order of business would be to get rid of President Trump's tax cuts. They got a $2 trillion green new deal. They wanna put socialized medicine in the heart of Obama care, risk the health insurance of 180 million Americans. But under President Donald Trump in three short years, we cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in history. We fought for free and fair trade unleashed American energy and businesses, large and small, created seven million good paying jobs, including 112,000 jobs right here in Michigan. It's true. You know, when Joe Biden was vice president, America actually lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. It's amazing, You know, I come from south of here in Indiana and just like Michigan, you know, we do two things well around here. We make things and we grow things right. We're proud of him. But the last president who I heard is out campaigning today. Four years ago, he said those jobs were never coming back. He actually said, What magic wand do you have? Well, we didn't need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House 500,000 manufacturing jobs created in just three years. And when it comes to trade, so important, what we make and what we grow. Joe Biden Zeman, a cheerleader for Communist China all along the way, and he never lifted a finger to reform a trade deal with Mexico and Canada that literally cost thousands of factories to close across this country. But under President Trump, we put China on notice. Way imposed tariffs have made it clear the era of economic surrender is over and NAFTA is gone, and the U. S N. C. A is here to stay. You know Joe Biden's running mate. Actually, I had a debate with her in Salt Lake City a couple of weeks ago. Some people think we did all right, so thank you. But I brought this up in the debate because you deserve to know. Kamala Harris was one of only 10 senators to vote against the U. S. M. C A. She said it didn't go far enough on climate change. I mean common. Harris put her radical environmental agenda ahead of Michigan jobs in Michigan. Workers don't make you a promise. We're four more years. President Trump will always put American jobs and American workers first. I'll tell you, it's just it's clear on energy. Mean Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to crush the American economy under a $2 trillion version of the green New Deal. Remember that first debate? The president had to remind Joe Biden that he supported the green New Deal. He does. I mean, the green New Deal. I'm telling you, it would actually raise the cost of electricity in your home and raise the cost of electricity in every business in Michigan. President THe's been a champion for American energy. We ended the war on coal. We've opened up our natural resource is, and we're now a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. It's true, but we're still Joe Biden and Kamala Harris over the last year said over and over again that they wanna abolish fossil fuels and banned fracking. I mean, that would cost hundreds of thousands of direct jobs across the Heartland. They said it over and over again, and then Joe Biden shows up in Pittsburgh. I wouldn't far from there Today, couple of weeks back and He's trying to convince people in Pennsylvania that he's not for Bannon Frack, and he actually said our president was lying about his record. Remember, even in that presidential debate? And how good did President Trump doing that? Presidential debate? Um, I right out of the park. Still going right? What? Well, in that presidential debate, you saw the moment where Joe Biden said that we needed to quote transition from the oil industry. President Trump said. That's a big statement, right? And then when the president called him on it, he said, Show the tape. So we've been showing the tape and I bet with the president gets here, he's gonna show you the tape again. Many women of Michigan, no matter what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris saying right now, you can take it to the bank, Joe Biden and Democratic Party. We're gonna try and abolish fossil fuels closed down the oil industry banned fracking, but we're not going to let it happen. We're gonna have more fracking mawr, American energy, mawr, energy, independence for this generation and for generations to come when we reelect President Donald Trump for four more years, Yeah, I mean, honestly, here's the choice America faces. It's a choice between a trump boom and a Biden depression. I mean, the study just came out nonpartisan study That said Joe Biden's economic policies would cost five million American jobs, and it would reduce the average income of American families by $6500 a year. So when you go home tonight, if you run into anybody tonight or any time on Election Day, who hasn't made a decision yet in Michigan? Here's what you gotta ask him. Seriously, just look at him and say, Who do you really think Kenbrell, This economy all the way back? E. I mean a career politician who spent 47 years raising taxes, stifling the economy with regulation and economic surrender, or a proven job creator who's overseeing the fastest economic recovery in history to bring America all the way back. We need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House, so it's about our economy. But we all know the security is the foundation of our prosperity, and I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside of president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families. You might not know. We've got some service members in our immediate family. My sons, the United States Marine and my unworthy son in law is the United States Navy pilot currently deployed with the United States Navy. They couldn't be with us tonight, but I couldn't be more proud that that Navy spouse, my wonderful daughter Charlotte Pence Bond, is traveling with her mom and dad today. Would you say hi, so proud of? But she deserved to know when Joe Biden was vice president. We went through years of reckless budget cuts, didn't we, John mean that hollowed out our military readiness? And over the last few days, I read where Democrats in Washington are already saying that they're planning. They're planning massive cuts to our national defense to pay for their big government programs. President Trump, we rebuild our military. This president signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. And with four more years we're going to keep giving our soldiers, sailors, airman, Marines and Coast Guard. The resource is and the support they need to defend our nation. And it's not just been about those who serve in uniform. It's been about those of you who did serve when Joe Biden was vice president. We remember the scandals of the VA that shocked the conscience of the nation. Don't wait. I mean, we had veterans that were literally dying, waiting for care of the V A on waiting lists. But when President Trump came into the Oval Office, those days are over. Our president has signed the most sweeping reforms of the VA in 50 years. We fired 3000 VA employees who weren't given our veterans the care they deserve. The VA now has a 91% approval rating and veterans choices now available for every veteran in America. And for a national defense to support our veterans for Peace through strength is just one mawr reason why we need a combat veteran in the United States Senate. We need John James in the Senate from the great state of Michigan. And when it comes to law and order, President Donald Trump has stood with the men and women who served on the thin blue line of law enforcement every single day. I mean, you all know what the president I know. Men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement in this country or some of the best people in America, and they deserve the respect of every American every day. After the summer of violence that we've seen after the rioting and looting that we saw in Philadelphia this week, the truth is Joe Biden would double down on the policies that are leading the violence in our cities. Now Joe Biden says that America is, in his words, systemically racist. He says that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities. When Joe Biden was asked whether he'd cut funding for law enforcement, he replied, Yes, absolutely. And his running mate, Kamala Harris, recently praised the L A mayor for cutting 150 million out of the LAPD's budget under President Donald Trump. I'll make your promise. We're not going to defund the police. Not now, not ever. We're gonna back the blue, and we're gonna back the blue for four more years. You know the president. I know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African American neighbors and families and other minorities in our cities. We've done both for the last 3.5 years and we're gonna keep doing both. We're gonna support law enforcement with more resource is and more training. And we're gonna keep creating jobs and opportunity and educational choice options for African Americans and all the families that live in our major cities. And we're gonna have law and order for every American of every race and creed and color. So help us God. All along the way. Under this president's leadership, we've stood for all the liberties and freedoms enshrined in our founding documents like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech and President Donald Trump has stood strong for the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. We've appointed more than 220 conservative judges to our federal courts at every level. And I promise you, they're all conservatives will uphold the God given liberties enshrined in our Constitution like Justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh and, just like Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Then she great, didn't you got How much did you like that when they asked her what she had on that piece of paper and program? Nothing. She's going to be an amazing jurors for generations to come and she's gonna she's gonna make America proud. But you all deserved to know when Joe Biden was vice president. We saw a steadyault on our religious freedom. We did. They use the power of the bureaucratic state to erode the conscience rights of doctors and nurses. They even hauled a group of Catholic nuns into federal court to force them to compromise their faith to live under the mandates of obamacare. It's true. When Judge Amy Coney Barrett was up for, ah, a different court two years ago, that same religious intolerance among the Democrats in Washington came out. The leading Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said she was concerned about judge barrettes Catholic faith because, she said, and I quote, the dogma lives loudly within you and Hollywood elites started attacking Judge Barrett, and they've never stopped. Well, I got a message for the Democrats in Washington and their friends in Hollywood. Yeah, false alarm. I got a message for the Democrats in Washington and their friends in Hollywood that dogma lives loudly in me that dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and work and worship according the dictates of our faith. lives loudly in the Constitution of the United States of America and under President Donald Trump. We've stood for that first freedom, religious freedom strong. We restored the conscience rights of doctors and nurses, and it was President Donald Trump who ended the assault on the little sisters of the poor, and the Supreme Court made it permanent. And finally, where Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth, I couldn't be more proud to be vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. So in our first three years, we rebuild our military, we revived our economy. We stood for law and order liberties in life. None of that would have been possible without the strong support of Michigan's Republicans in Congress. So right after you re elect President Donald Trump right after you send John James to the United States Senate, we all need Michigan to send Congressman Jack Bergman and Congressman John Mullen are to a new Republican majority and retire Nancy Pelosi once and for all. Along out. I'm telling you out, you know, when you look at what we were able to accomplish all of us for the support of the people of Michigan, that historic election four years ago. I think there's only one way you could describe. In three short years, we made America great again and then 2020 arrived as President Trump lead our nation through the worst global pandemic in a century, and all along the way, President Donald Trump put the health of America first. It's true. Before the first documented case of community spread, President Trump did what no American president has ever done in history. He closed off all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now Joe Biden at the time said that was xenophobic, which is, I guess, a fancy word for racist. He said closing off travel during a global pandemic would actually quote make things worse. But Joe Biden got it wrong, and President Donald Trump got it right. E can tell you, as the head of the White House coronavirus task force these last eight months, President Trump's action shutting off travel to China saved untold American lives because it bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War two. It's true. We re invented testing. We saw the manufacturing production, including here in Michigan, a billions of supplies of medical equipment and PPE. We develop therapeutics that air saving lives, and we are literally a short time away from having the first safe coronavirus vaccine and tens of millions of doses for the American people. Then, I promise you, people in Michigan can be confident we're gonna keep making sure those supplies air available over the great doctors and nurses were gonna keep protecting the vulnerable. We're gonna keep saving lives and distributive vaccine, and we're opening up America again. It's amazing to think in the last five months on that foundation we poured. And with the unprecedented relief for families and businesses, the president's secured from Congress. After losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic, we've already seen 11.5 million people go back to work, including 600,000 people right here in Michigan. We're opening up America and Michigan is roaring back, but you all deserve to know. Joe Biden is talking about shutting down our economy again. It's true, if you saw the newspapers, the last couple of days. Several European countries, they're already talking about shutting down. So you can bet that Joe Biden lock down the American economy. If he makes it to the White House, all the schools will be closed. All your churches, synagogues, places of worship businesses will all be shuttered again. I mean, right at the moment that the American economy is getting back on its feet, Joe Biden said this summer, he would shut it down. Well, Joe Biden says, we're in for a long, dark winter, but under President Donald Trump, we're going to defeat the virus, and the best is yet to come. You know, the choice in this election has never been clear. The stakes have never been higher when you look at their agenda. Higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine green New Deal de funding, the police, abortion on demand. It's clear Joe Biden would be nothing mawr than a Trojan horse for the radical left. I don't know if you've seen it in the news, but Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are already angling for Cabinet posts. You know, Joe Biden said that democracy is on the ballot tomorrow. Well, I think our economic recovery is on the ballot. I think law and order are on the ballot. But I also think there are things farm or foundational to our country that are on the ballot as well. Men and women of Michigan in this election. I think it's not going to be so much whether America ends up more Republican or more Democrat, more liberal or more conservative, more red or more blue. The choice in this election is whether America remains America. Yeah, whether we're going to chart a future with President Donald Trump, build on our American heritage of faith and family and patriotism and freedom, or whether we're gonna let Joe Biden and the Democratic Party's surrender our country to the radical left, shut down our economy, topple our heritage and our values and our freedom in an avalanche of socialism and decline. So let me say, from my heart, the all of my friends here in Michigan, for all the ideals and values that have always made this country unique, an exception for our very freedom bequeathed to us by generations of Americans. We need to decide right here and right now that Joe Biden will never be president of the United States. We're going to re elect President Donald Trump for four more years. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, I've gotten to know this president of the last four years. Some people think we're a little bit different, but actually, we've got to be very close friends. We spend time together every day or we speak every day. And I can tell you President Donald Trump is a real deal. He's a man who says what he means and means what he says. He never quits. He never backs down. And he has never stopped fighting to keep the promises that he made to the American people. Now it's our turn to fight for him. It's our turn to fight for forem or years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Four more years means more jobs. Four more years means more judges. Four more years means, um, or support for our troops. And it's going to take it least four more years to train that swamp. So before he gets here, I got a couple things to ask you to dio number one before the polls closed Tomorrow. We need you to vote Michigan vote to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. Yeah, time for speeches is almost over. Time for voting is coming up tomorrow morning. I'm told the polls open 7 a.m. Open till eight. PM here in Michigan. And remember, friends don't let friends vote alone. Bring a family member, bring a neighbor, bring a coworker and vote to reelect President Donald Trump to the White House. I excuse me. And secondly, after you vote with a friend, I need you to go find somebody toe talk to about this election. I mean, Michigan always plays an outsized role in presidential politics, and that will be especially true this year. The choice that Michigan makes is literally gonna be a choice that sets our nation on one path or another for generations to come. So you just need to tell them about the stakes in this election. Tell him about the progress we made the way this president's lead us through this challenging year, the way we rebuild our military revived our economy the way America is coming back and tell them about the choice and tell them why. You know the president. I were on a news show, a week ago Sunday. 60 minutes it was, Yeah, right, so But there was a great moment. So the president got asked a question. I just his answer. I'll just never forget. The reporter looks at him and she says, Thinking about all of you, she said, So how would you describe your supporters? And without hesitation, the president answered the question. She said, How would you describe your supporters? And he said, They are people who love our country. So go find a neighbor. Tell them you love America and tell them we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Yeah, then finally, I just encourage you and all that remains between now and when the polls close. Just have faith, have faith in America. When you speak to your neighbors and friends, you know, I think you study American history every time. The American people have given a clear choice between a future of more freedom and less freedom. They choose freedom every time, have faith in the boundless capacity of the American people to overcome any challenge, and finally have faith that he who planted this miracle of democracy on this wilderness shores we'll see us through these challenging times to bring us through stronger and better than ever before verse that's been over the mantle of our home for 20 years, since we first step forward to serve in public life, their ancient words that Americans have long clung to and our little family does simply say, for I know the plans I have for you plans to prosper you, not to harm you plans to give you Ah, hope and a future. Have faith and pray for America. And I just know if all of us do all we need to do between now and when the polls close at eight o'clock here in Michigan tomorrow, with your continued support and your prayers, we're gonna have a great victory all across Michigan and all across America. On with Congressman Jack Bergman and Congressman John Malone are in that new Republican majority in the House with John James in a larger Republican majority in the United States Senate.

Would you join me in thanking the greatest second lady of the United States that we've ever had my wife, Karen, fan, I thank you, but Karen and I are here for one reason and one reason only. And that is that Michigan and America need forem or years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Out it's on Michigan, and the road to victory goes right through the Great Lakes State. We need the people of this freedom loving state to do just what you did in 2016. By tomorrow night, we need Michigan to show America that this is Trump Country, but it really is great to be with you all. It really is great. Also, it's great to be here with some good friends of mine and other presidents, in fact, one of whom is the highest ranking combat veteran ever to serve in the Congress of the United States. Now he's one of the strongest voices for our national events. Join me in thanking Congressman Jack Bergman, Will you? Thank you, Jack. It's also great to be here with a man who has served the people of Michigan in the State House, and I've served alongside him, and I could tell you he is one of the strongest allies of our president and our agenda in the United States Congress Congressman John Molinar and let me say what a privilege it is to be here with a man that I got to know over the last couple of years. He's a man of integrity. He's a family man, a West Point graduate, a combat veteran, a businessman and the next senator from the Great state of Michigan. John James. Well, thank you all for being here. I know you're out today. Toe here and see our president. Show your support. But I also know you're here because of all that we accomplished together over the last four years. I mean, think about it. Four years ago, we inherited a military that was hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise, and we witnessed a steady assault on our values. But in three short years we rebuild our military way, revive our economy. We secured our border, supported law enforcement and stood for life, liberty and the Constitution of the United States. You know, after Joe Biden spent the previous eight years trying to tax and spend and bail our way back to a growing economy. President Donald Tcreated the greatest economy in American history on we're doing it Again, Michigan e mean, how about those new GDP numbers? Last week's You check that out 33% growth in the third quarter shattered any previous record. The great American comeback is on on with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. We're gonna bring this economy back bigger and better than ever before, you know, the president said. It was the biggest quarter in the history of our country, not even close. And he and I both know this American comeback is a testament, all of you to the resilience and the strength of the character of the American people. But it's also a tribute to a president and our allies in Congress who created the greatest economy the world has ever seen. That's why it's remarkable to think in the midst of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion. His running mate, Kamala Harris, said on Friday that their quote first order of business would be to get rid of President Trump's tax cuts. They got a $2 trillion green new deal. They wanna put socialized medicine in the heart of Obama care, risk the health insurance of 180 million Americans. But under President Donald Trump in three short years, we cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in history. We fought for free and fair trade unleashed American energy and businesses, large and small, created seven million good paying jobs, including 112,000 jobs right here in Michigan. It's true. You know, when Joe Biden was vice president, America actually lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. It's amazing, You know, I come from south of here in Indiana and just like Michigan, you know, we do two things well around here. We make things and we grow things right. We're proud of him. But the last president who I heard is out campaigning today. Four years ago, he said those jobs were never coming back. He actually said, What magic wand do you have? Well, we didn't need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House 500,000 manufacturing jobs created in just three years. And when it comes to trade, so important, what we make and what we grow. Joe Biden Zeman, a cheerleader for Communist China all along the way, and he never lifted a finger to reform a trade deal with Mexico and Canada that literally cost thousands of factories to close across this country. But under President Trump, we put China on notice. Way imposed tariffs have made it clear the era of economic surrender is over and NAFTA is gone, and the U. S N. C. A is here to stay. You know Joe Biden's running mate. Actually, I had a debate with her in Salt Lake City a couple of weeks ago. Some people think we did all right, so thank you. But I brought this up in the debate because you deserve to know. Kamala Harris was one of only 10 senators to vote against the U. S. M. C A. She said it didn't go far enough on climate change. I mean common. Harris put her radical environmental agenda ahead of Michigan jobs in Michigan. Workers don't make you a promise. We're four more years. President Trump will always put American jobs and American workers first. I'll tell you, it's just it's clear on energy. Mean Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to crush the American economy under a $2 trillion version of the green New Deal. Remember that first debate? The president had to remind Joe Biden that he supported the green New Deal. He does. I mean, the green New Deal. I'm telling you, it would actually raise the cost of electricity in your home and raise the cost of electricity in every business in Michigan. President THe's been a champion for American energy. We ended the war on coal. We've opened up our natural resource is, and we're now a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. It's true, but we're still Joe Biden and Kamala Harris over the last year said over and over again that they wanna abolish fossil fuels and banned fracking. I mean, that would cost hundreds of thousands of direct jobs across the Heartland. They said it over and over again, and then Joe Biden shows up in Pittsburgh. I wouldn't far from there Today, couple of weeks back and He's trying to convince people in Pennsylvania that he's not for Bannon Frack, and he actually said our president was lying about his record. Remember, even in that presidential debate? And how good did President Trump doing that? Presidential debate? Um, I right out of the park. Still going right? What? Well, in that presidential debate, you saw the moment where Joe Biden said that we needed to quote transition from the oil industry. President Trump said. That's a big statement, right? And then when the president called him on it, he said, Show the tape. So we've been showing the tape and I bet with the president gets here, he's gonna show you the tape again. Many women of Michigan, no matter what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris saying right now, you can take it to the bank, Joe Biden and Democratic Party. We're gonna try and abolish fossil fuels closed down the oil industry banned fracking, but we're not going to let it happen. We're gonna have more fracking mawr, American energy, mawr, energy, independence for this generation and for generations to come when we reelect President Donald Trump for four more years, Yeah, I mean, honestly, here's the choice America faces. It's a choice between a trump boom and a Biden depression. I mean, the study just came out nonpartisan study That said Joe Biden's economic policies would cost five million American jobs, and it would reduce the average income of American families by $6500 a year. So when you go home tonight, if you run into anybody tonight or any time on Election Day, who hasn't made a decision yet in Michigan? Here's what you gotta ask him. Seriously, just look at him and say, Who do you really think Kenbrell, This economy all the way back? E. I mean a career politician who spent 47 years raising taxes, stifling the economy with regulation and economic surrender, or a proven job creator who's overseeing the fastest economic recovery in history to bring America all the way back. We need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House, so it's about our economy. But we all know the security is the foundation of our prosperity, and I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside of president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families. You might not know. We've got some service members in our immediate family. My sons, the United States Marine and my unworthy son in law is the United States Navy pilot currently deployed with the United States Navy. They couldn't be with us tonight, but I couldn't be more proud that that Navy spouse, my wonderful daughter Charlotte Pence Bond, is traveling with her mom and dad today. Would you say hi, so proud of? But she deserved to know when Joe Biden was vice president. We went through years of reckless budget cuts, didn't we, John mean that hollowed out our military readiness? And over the last few days, I read where Democrats in Washington are already saying that they're planning. They're planning massive cuts to our national defense to pay for their big government programs. President Trump, we rebuild our military. This president signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. And with four more years we're going to keep giving our soldiers, sailors, airman, Marines and Coast Guard. The resource is and the support they need to defend our nation. And it's not just been about those who serve in uniform. It's been about those of you who did serve when Joe Biden was vice president. We remember the scandals of the VA that shocked the conscience of the nation. Don't wait. I mean, we had veterans that were literally dying, waiting for care of the V A on waiting lists. But when President Trump came into the Oval Office, those days are over. Our president has signed the most sweeping reforms of the VA in 50 years. We fired 3000 VA employees who weren't given our veterans the care they deserve. The VA now has a 91% approval rating and veterans choices now available for every veteran in America. And for a national defense to support our veterans for Peace through strength is just one mawr reason why we need a combat veteran in the United States Senate. We need John James in the Senate from the great state of Michigan. And when it comes to law and order, President Donald Trump has stood with the men and women who served on the thin blue line of law enforcement every single day. I mean, you all know what the president I know. Men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement in this country or some of the best people in America, and they deserve the respect of every American every day. After the summer of violence that we've seen after the rioting and looting that we saw in Philadelphia this week, the truth is Joe Biden would double down on the policies that are leading the violence in our cities. Now Joe Biden says that America is, in his words, systemically racist. He says that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities. When Joe Biden was asked whether he'd cut funding for law enforcement, he replied, Yes, absolutely. And his running mate, Kamala Harris, recently praised the L A mayor for cutting 150 million out of the LAPD's budget under President Donald Trump. I'll make your promise. We're not going to defund the police. Not now, not ever. We're gonna back the blue, and we're gonna back the blue for four more years. You know the president. I know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African American neighbors and families and other minorities in our cities. We've done both for the last 3.5 years and we're gonna keep doing both. We're gonna support law enforcement with more resource is and more training. And we're gonna keep creating jobs and opportunity and educational choice options for African Americans and all the families that live in our major cities. And we're gonna have law and order for every American of every race and creed and color. So help us God. All along the way. Under this president's leadership, we've stood for all the liberties and freedoms enshrined in our founding documents like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech and President Donald Trump has stood strong for the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. We've appointed more than 220 conservative judges to our federal courts at every level. And I promise you, they're all conservatives will uphold the God given liberties enshrined in our Constitution like Justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh and, just like Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Then she great, didn't you got How much did you like that when they asked her what she had on that piece of paper and program? Nothing. She's going to be an amazing jurors for generations to come and she's gonna she's gonna make America proud. But you all deserved to know when Joe Biden was vice president. We saw a steadyault on our religious freedom. We did. They use the power of the bureaucratic state to erode the conscience rights of doctors and nurses. They even hauled a group of Catholic nuns into federal court to force them to compromise their faith to live under the mandates of obamacare. It's true. When Judge Amy Coney Barrett was up for, ah, a different court two years ago, that same religious intolerance among the Democrats in Washington came out. The leading Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said she was concerned about judge barrettes Catholic faith because, she said, and I quote, the dogma lives loudly within you and Hollywood elites started attacking Judge Barrett, and they've never stopped. Well, I got a message for the Democrats in Washington and their friends in Hollywood. Yeah, false alarm. I got a message for the Democrats in Washington and their friends in Hollywood that dogma lives loudly in me that dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and work and worship according the dictates of our faith. lives loudly in the Constitution of the United States of America and under President Donald Trump. We've stood for that first freedom, religious freedom strong. We restored the conscience rights of doctors and nurses, and it was President Donald Trump who ended the assault on the little sisters of the poor, and the Supreme Court made it permanent. And finally, where Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth, I couldn't be more proud to be vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. So in our first three years, we rebuild our military, we revived our economy. We stood for law and order liberties in life. None of that would have been possible without the strong support of Michigan's Republicans in Congress. So right after you re elect President Donald Trump right after you send John James to the United States Senate, we all need Michigan to send Congressman Jack Bergman and Congressman John Mullen are to a new Republican majority and retire Nancy Pelosi once and for all. Along out. I'm telling you out, you know, when you look at what we were able to accomplish all of us for the support of the people of Michigan, that historic election four years ago. I think there's only one way you could describe. In three short years, we made America great again and then 2020 arrived as President Trump lead our nation through the worst global pandemic in a century, and all along the way, President Donald Trump put the health of America first. It's true. Before the first documented case of community spread, President Trump did what no American president has ever done in history. He closed off all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now Joe Biden at the time said that was xenophobic, which is, I guess, a fancy word for racist. He said closing off travel during a global pandemic would actually quote make things worse. But Joe Biden got it wrong, and President Donald Trump got it right. E can tell you, as the head of the White House coronavirus task force these last eight months, President Trump's action shutting off travel to China saved untold American lives because it bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War two. It's true. We re invented testing. We saw the manufacturing production, including here in Michigan, a billions of supplies of medical equipment and PPE. We develop therapeutics that air saving lives, and we are literally a short time away from having the first safe coronavirus vaccine and tens of millions of doses for the American people. Then, I promise you, people in Michigan can be confident we're gonna keep making sure those supplies air available over the great doctors and nurses were gonna keep protecting the vulnerable. We're gonna keep saving lives and distributive vaccine, and we're opening up America again. It's amazing to think in the last five months on that foundation we poured. And with the unprecedented relief for families and businesses, the president's secured from Congress. After losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic, we've already seen 11.5 million people go back to work, including 600,000 people right here in Michigan. We're opening up America and Michigan is roaring back, but you all deserve to know. Joe Biden is talking about shutting down our economy again. It's true, if you saw the newspapers, the last couple of days. Several European countries, they're already talking about shutting down. So you can bet that Joe Biden lock down the American economy. If he makes it to the White House, all the schools will be closed. All your churches, synagogues, places of worship businesses will all be shuttered again. I mean, right at the moment that the American economy is getting back on its feet, Joe Biden said this summer, he would shut it down. Well, Joe Biden says, we're in for a long, dark winter, but under President Donald Trump, we're going to defeat the virus, and the best is yet to come. You know, the choice in this election has never been clear. The stakes have never been higher when you look at their agenda. Higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine green New Deal de funding, the police, abortion on demand. It's clear Joe Biden would be nothing mawr than a Trojan horse for the radical left. I don't know if you've seen it in the news, but Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are already angling for Cabinet posts. You know, Joe Biden said that democracy is on the ballot tomorrow. Well, I think our economic recovery is on the ballot. I think law and order are on the ballot. But I also think there are things farm or foundational to our country that are on the ballot as well. Men and women of Michigan in this election. I think it's not going to be so much whether America ends up more Republican or more Democrat, more liberal or more conservative, more red or more blue. The choice in this election is whether America remains America. Yeah, whether we're going to chart a future with President Donald Trump, build on our American heritage of faith and family and patriotism and freedom, or whether we're gonna let Joe Biden and the Democratic Party's surrender our country to the radical left, shut down our economy, topple our heritage and our values and our freedom in an avalanche of socialism and decline. So let me say, from my heart, the all of my friends here in Michigan, for all the ideals and values that have always made this country unique, an exception for our very freedom bequeathed to us by generations of Americans. We need to decide right here and right now that Joe Biden will never be president of the United States. We're going to re elect President Donald Trump for four more years. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, I've gotten to know this president of the last four years. Some people think we're a little bit different, but actually, we've got to be very close friends. We spend time together every day or we speak every day. And I can tell you President Donald Trump is a real deal. He's a man who says what he means and means what he says. He never quits. He never backs down. And he has never stopped fighting to keep the promises that he made to the American people. Now it's our turn to fight for him. It's our turn to fight for forem or years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Four more years means more jobs. Four more years means more judges. Four more years means, um, or support for our troops. And it's going to take it least four more years to train that swamp. So before he gets here, I got a couple things to ask you to dio number one before the polls closed Tomorrow. We need you to vote Michigan vote to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. Yeah, time for speeches is almost over. Time for voting is coming up tomorrow morning. I'm told the polls open 7 a.m. Open till eight. PM here in Michigan. And remember, friends don't let friends vote alone. Bring a family member, bring a neighbor, bring a coworker and vote to reelect President Donald Trump to the White House. I excuse me. And secondly, after you vote with a friend, I need you to go find somebody toe talk to about this election. I mean, Michigan always plays an outsized role in presidential politics, and that will be especially true this year. The choice that Michigan makes is literally gonna be a choice that sets our nation on one path or another for generations to come. So you just need to tell them about the stakes in this election. Tell him about the progress we made the way this president's lead us through this challenging year, the way we rebuild our military revived our economy the way America is coming back and tell them about the choice and tell them why. You know the president. I were on a news show, a week ago Sunday. 60 minutes it was, Yeah, right, so But there was a great moment. So the president got asked a question. I just his answer. I'll just never forget. The reporter looks at him and she says, Thinking about all of you, she said, So how would you describe your supporters? And without hesitation, the president answered the question. She said, How would you describe your supporters? And he said, They are people who love our country. So go find a neighbor. Tell them you love America and tell them we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Yeah, then finally, I just encourage you and all that remains between now and when the polls close. Just have faith, have faith in America. When you speak to your neighbors and friends, you know, I think you study American history every time. The American people have given a clear choice between a future of more freedom and less freedom. They choose freedom every time, have faith in the boundless capacity of the American people to overcome any challenge, and finally have faith that he who planted this miracle of democracy on this wilderness shores we'll see us through these challenging times to bring us through stronger and better than ever before verse that's been over the mantle of our home for 20 years, since we first step forward to serve in public life, their ancient words that Americans have long clung to and our little family does simply say, for I know the plans I have for you plans to prosper you, not to harm you plans to give you Ah, hope and a future. Have faith and pray for America. And I just know if all of us do all we need to do between now and when the polls close at eight o'clock here in Michigan tomorrow, with your continued support and your prayers, we're gonna have a great victory all across Michigan and all across America. On with Congressman Jack Bergman and Congressman John Malone are in that new Republican majority in the House with John James in a larger Republican majority in the United States Senate. With President Donald Trump back in the White House for four more years and with God's help, we're gonna make Michigan in America more prosperous than ever before. We're gonna make Michigan and America safer than ever before. We're gonna make Michigan in America more united than ever before. And with your support together we will make America great again. Again. Thank you all very much. God bless you. God bless America. Now let's go get it done.

THINGS SPIRAL TO EPIC PROPORTIONS AND MY FATHER AMONG MANY OTHER REFUGEES AND THEMSELVES IN A HUGE HORRIFYING DYSTOPIA. IT REALLY IS A STORY THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT AN INTERVIEW , AND EVERYONE SHOULD HEAR. SUNDAY NIGHT AT 8:00 EASTERN ON C-SPAN'S Q&A. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE WAS IN GEORGIA CAMPAIGNING FOR SENATORS DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LEFFLER, NEITHER ONE , WON 50% IN THE ELECTION, SO BY STATE LAW THEY FACE RUNOFF ELECTIONS, ONLY ONE OF THE NEEDS TO WIN FOR REPUBLICANS TO MAINTAIN THE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. HELLO, GEORGIA, HOW ARE YOU ALL DOING? IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE AND GREAT TO SEE YOU ALL HERE, YOU KNOW THE STATE SONG GEORGIA ON MY MIND, GEORGIA IS ON EVERYBODY'S MIND BECAUSE GEORGIA IS GOING TO KEEP THE SENATE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THIS COUNTRY.

AMERICA IS COUNTING ON YOU AND WE ARE COUNTING ON YOU, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. IT IS A GREAT DAY, A BEAUTIFUL NORTH GEORGIA DAY AND I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE. IN SOME OF THE DARKEST DAYS OF WORLD WAR II, A BUSINESS LEADER SAID WE NEVER, NEVER, NEVER GIVE IT UP, WILL YOU GIVE IT UP? WE ARE NEVER GIVING UP. AND THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE, WE ARE NEVER GIVING UP ON PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WE ARE DEFTLY NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ON DAVID PURDUE AND KELLY LEFFLER. SO FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE?

NOBODY ASKED FOR THIS, BUT WE ARE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR AMERICA, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? [APPLAUSE] I JUST TOLD THE VICE PRESIDENT, WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE THIS FIGHT BY GEORGIA, LET'S HAVE IT IN GEORGIA RIGHT NOW. WE ALL KNOW WHAT CHUCK SCHUMER HAS SAID, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE GEORGIA AND CHANGE AMERICA, WELL WE ARE GOING TO WIN GEORGIA AND SAVE AMERICA. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY THAT IS SO IMPORTANT, WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO IT FOR THE LAST X MONTHS, THEY WANT THE GREEN NEW DEAL, THEY WANT TO OPEN BORDERS, WHAT , THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY OUR HEALTH INSURANCE. THEY WANT TO DEFUND SOON WE SHOULD BE DEFENDING THE POLICE. BUT MOST OF ALL, WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS GO TO A ONE PARTY SYSTEM. LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF AOC, SHE SAYS WE HAVE TO WIN THOSE SEATS IN GEORGIA BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO NEGOTIATE, WE WANT THE GREEN NEW DEAL WITHOUT COMPROMISE. THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THEM HAVE IT, THEY ARE SENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DOWN HERE TO GEORGIA TO TRY AND CHANGE OUR MINDS, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT. WE HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THEM THE TRUTH, 52.5% OF GEORGIANS REJECTED THE DEMOCRATIC PLAN. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, YOU HEARD SONNY DO THIS, WE HAVE TO GET OUR VOTE OUT, EARLY, DO NOT WAIT FOR JANUARY THE FIFTH. THERE IS SOMETHING IN NORTH GEORGIA CALLED ICE STORMS, RIGHT? I AM WORRIED ABOUT THAT, WE NEED TO GET OUT, EARLY VOTING STARTS DECEMBER 14. WE NEED YOU TO VOTE, TAKE YOUR FRIENDS, KELLY ARE , KELLY AND I ARE ASKING YOU TO STAND WITH US AND MAKE SURE WE SEND THIS TO AMERICA, WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ROAD TO SOCIALISM NEVER RUNS THROUGH THE STATE OF GEORGIA. [APPLAUSE] SO WITH YOUR HELP, BY GETTING OUR VOTE OUT AGAIN , AND I SAY AGAIN, BY GETTING THE VOTE OUT AGAIN WE WILL TELL AMERICA IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE WORLD THAT THE WORK WE HAVE DONE IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN FOR NOT , NAUGHT, WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT THE WORK OF DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS THAT MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] IT IS MY HONOR TO BE RUNNING FOR THE SEAT ALONG WITH KELLY LEFFLER. THEY HAVE DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB OF STEPPING UP AFTER THEIR RACE AND GETTING BEHIND KELLY LOEFFLER AND ME AND I WANT TO CALL DOUG OUT AND THANK HIM FOR THAT PERSONALLY. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING SO INVOLVED IN GETTING US TO THIS POINT, WE ARE THIS CLOSE, ALL WE HAVE GOT TO DO IS FINISH IT. WE BURNED THE SHIPS, WE CANNOT GO BACK, WE HAVE GOT TO GO FORWARD TO JANUARY 5 AND MAKE SURE THE DEMOCRATS LEAVE WITH THEIR TAILS WAGGING BEHIND THEM AND NEVER COME BACK. KELLY LEFFLER IS A FARM GIRL, SHE GREW UP, SHE KNOWS WHAT WORK IS ALL ABOUT. SHE IS AN OUTSIDER LIKE I AM, SHE HAS WORKED HARD TO GET HERE, PLEASE WELCOME THE NEXT SENATOR FROM GEORGIA, KELLY LEFFLER. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH, OH MY GOSH, GAINESVILLE ARE WE READY TO SHOW AMERICA THAT GEORGIA IS A RED STATE? [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE BECAUSE LOOK, WE HAVE GOT A BATTLE ON OUR HANDS. WE ARE THE FIREWALLS TO SOCIALISM IN AMERICA AND WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THE LINE RIGHT HERE IN GEORGIA. LOOK AT WHAT IS AT STAKE, CHUCK SCHUMER SAID TAKE GEORGIA, CHANGE AMERICA, THAT CANNOT HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT HIGHER TAXES, NO. THE GREEN NEW DEAL, OPEN BORDERS, THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS, THEY WANT TO PACK THE COURT WITH LIBERAL JUDGES WHO WILL TAKE AWAY OUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES, WE HAVE GOT TO HOLD THE LINE. THAT IS WHY THIS BATTLE IS STILL IN OUR HANDS AND IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH YEAR, WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A BATTLE BUT WE ARE NOT DONE FIGHTING AND I HAVE TO THANK CONGRESSMAN DOUG COLLINS FOR HIS SUPPORT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE AS CONSERVATIVES, WE ARE UNITING ACROSS THE STATE TO GET THE JOB DONE TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT GEORGIA IS A RED STATE, THAT IS RIGHT. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HERE IS WHAT IS AT STAKE, IT IS NOT JUST RADICAL IDEAS, IT IS RADICAL CANDIDATES LIKE RAPHAEL WARNOCK. NO THANKS. THAT IS RIGHT, RAFAEL WARNOCK HAS CALLED OUR MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT GANGSTERS, THUGS, BULLIES, AND A THREAT TO OUR CHILDREN. WHEN I ASKED HIM , THAT'S RIGHT. WE WILL NOT HAVE THAT IN THE U.S. SENATE, WE CERTAINLY WON'T HAVE IT IN GEORGIA. WHEN I ASKED HIM TO APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE COMMENTS, HE REFUSED. HE ALSO SAID YOU CANNOT SERVE IN THE MILITARY AND SERVE GOD. HE SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE COMMENTS, THAT IS AN INSULT ON THE DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTER OF VETERANS, I SERVED ON THE VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. GEORGIA IS A GREAT MILITARY STATE , LET'S HEAR IT. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS THE TRUTH. YOU KNOW HE CELEBRATED JEREMIAH WRIGHT WHO WANTED TO CONDEMN AMERICA, HE CALLED IT , HIM A PROPHET. WE TAKE NOTE IN THE SENATE TO PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION, HE CAN'T BE TRUSTED TO DO THAT. WE ARE BUSINESS PEOPLE, WE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR RESULTS, WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THE DEMOCRATS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR LACK OF RESULTS. WE HAVE TRIED TO PASS PANDEMIC RELIEF IN THE SENATE TIME AFTER TIME THE DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID NO, THEY HAVE SAID NO TO SMALL BUSINESSES, TO FARMERS, TO OUR TEACHERS TRYING TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS. THEY HAVE SAID NO FOR POLITICAL POWER, THAT IS WHAT ONE PARTY RULE LOOKS LIKE, IT IS WRONG FOR AMERICA, IT IS DEFTLY WRONG FOR GEORGIA. WE HAVE ALSO SAID WE NEED SCHOOL CHOICE, BUT DEMOCRATS DO NOT WANT SCHOOL CHOICE, THEY DO NOT WANT RELIGIOUS EDUCATION, THEY DON'T WANT HOMESCHOOLING, THEY DON'T WANT CHARTER SCHOOLS. THEY WANT PUBLIC SCHOOLS ONLY AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE OUR KIDS GET THE BEST EDUCATION AND THAT IT IS STUDENT CENTERED. AND WE ARE GOING TO STAND UP FOR CONSERVATIVE VALUES BECAUSE LOOK AT WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE FOR OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAVE MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND , THAT'S RIGHT. IT IS OUR JOB TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT, KEEP FIGHTING FOR THIS PRESIDENT, KEEP FIGHTING FOR THIS VICE PRESIDENT BECAUSE THEY LOVE AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] HERE IS WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO, I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE FIGHTING FOR YOUR CONSERVATIVE VALUES, WE ARE GOING TO STOP TAXPAYER-FUNDED ABORTION , THAT'S RIGHT. WE WILL BE YOUR CONSERVATIVE VOICE IN THE SENATE FOR YEARS TO COME IF YOU WILL BE OUR VOICE ON JANUARY 5. THANK YOU. WE NEED YOU RIGHT NOW TO CALL YOUR FRIENDS, FAMILY, NEIGHBORS, COWORKERS, EVERYONE ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. GEORGIA IS ON THE FRONT LINES FOR AMERICA, STOPPING SOCIALISM AND SAVING OUR COUNTRY. IT IS IN OUR HANDS, WE CAN MAKE THAT DIFFERENCE RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE TO DO THAT AND VOTE EARLY, MOTIVATE OUR NEIGHBORS, PUT UP YARD SIGNS. GEORGIA HAS GOT A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO GO IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE, WE ARE GOING TO GET THIS DONE SO , COULD NOT BE MORE HONORED TO INTRODUCE VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE, SOMEONE WHO IS MAKING AMERICA GREAT. (music) HELLO GEORGIA. [APPLAUSE] IT IS GREAT TO BE IN THE PEACH STATE. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT, THIS LOOKS LIKE COME JANUARY 5 HERE IN GEORGIA WE ARE GOING TO HAVE US A RODEO. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK , WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING FORMER GOVERNOR SENATE , PURDUE, ONE OF THE GREATEST I HAVE EVER KNOWN. AND COMMISSIONER MCDONALD, GOP CHAIRMAN DAVID SCHAEFER, AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU IT IS A PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE IN THE HOME DISTRICT OF ONE OF THE GREATEST ALLIES THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS HAD ON CAPITOL HILL, HE IS A COURAGEOUS AND FEARLESS MAN, A PRINCIPLED CONSERVATIVE AND A MAN OF INTEGRITY AND FAITH, JOIN ME IN THANKING CONGRESSMAN DOUG COLLINS FOR ALL HE HAS DONE FOR GEORGIA AND AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] IT REALLY IS GREAT TO BE WITH SO MANY FRIENDS TODAY, THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. SPEAKING OF FRIENDS OF MINE, ALLOW ME TO BRING GREETINGS FROM ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE. I TOLD HIM I WAS HEADED TO GEORGIA TODAY AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I THOUGHT HE LOOKED A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS. LET ME BRING GREETINGS FROM A LEADER WHO HAS BEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP THE PROMISES HE MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA EVERY SINGLE DAY, I BRING GREETINGS IN THE , FROM THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] LIKE ALL OF YOU I AM HERE BECAUSE I STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. BUT I'M ALSO HERE BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I STAND WITH SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER. I REALLY APPRECIATE Y'ALL COMING OUT, I TRULY DO. THE PRESIDENT AND I CANNOT BE MORE GRATEFUL OF THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE ACROSS GEORGIA OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS. AND OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS. IT IS AMAZING TO THINK SO FAR IN THIS ELECTION PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS RECEIVED MORE THAN 73 MILLION VOTES, MORE THAN ANY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT IN HISTORY, MORE THAN ANY INCUMBENT PRESIDENT IN HISTORY AND THE GREATEST SHARE OF MINORITY VOTES OF ANY REPUBLICAN IN 60 YEARS. I WILL TELL YOU, AS OUR ELECTION CONTEST CONTINUES HERE IN GEORGIA AND IN COURTS ACROSS AMERICA, I PROMISE YOU WE ARE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING UNTIL EVERY LEGAL VOTE IS COUNTED. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING UNTIL EVERY ILLEGAL VOTE IS THROWN OUT. GOOD WITH OVER THE FUTURE HOLDS, , AND WHATEVER THE FUTURE HOLDS, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THAT IS WHY IN ADDITION TO ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PRESIDENT, THAT IS WHY GEORGIA AND AMERICA NEED DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LEFFLER BACK IN A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. WE NEED THE PEACH STATE TO DEFEND THE SUMMIT AND THE ROAD TO REPUBLICAN MAJORITY GOES STRAIGHT THROUGH GEORGIA. ARE YOU WITH ME? [APPLAUSE] WE NEED GEORGIA TO SEND THESE SENATORS BACK TO A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE , BECAUSE OF ALL WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED, AND BECAUSE OF THE REPUBLICAN SENATE MAJORITY COULD BE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE IN PRESERVING ALL THAT WE HAVE DONE TO DEFEND THIS NATION, REVIVE OUR ECONOMY, AND PRESERVE THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES THAT WE ALL HOLD DEAR. I AM HERE FIRST AND FOREMOST BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE. LIKE A SON OF MACON WHO AFTER HIGH SCHOOL ENROLLED IN GEORGIA TECH, PAID HIS WAY THROUGH COLLEGE BY WORKING WAREHOUSE AND CONSTRUCTION JOBS, HE EVENTUALLY WOULD PUT TOGETHER AN EXTRAORDINARY CAREER IN BUSINESS, REACH THE TOP OF THE BUSINESS WORLD. A FORTY-YEAR SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS CAREER, BUT HE IS A MAN OF FAITH, HE FELT A CALLING TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND HE STEPPED FORWARD SIX YEARS AGO AND I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND, HE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE GREATEST ALLIES OF OUR AGENDA AND A PRESENT , OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND WASHINGTON, D.C. WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING SENATOR DAVID PERDUE? 2 , [APPLAUSE] INCREDIBLE MAN, A CHAMPION FOR GEORGE AND GEORGE'S VALUES. JUST LIKE ANOTHER LEADER, FOURTH JANUARY , GENERATION ON HER FAMILY'S FARM. SHE BUILT HER OWN COMPANY FROM THE GROUND APPEAR IN GEORGIA, SHE MADE HISTORY BREAKING THEIR YEARS BUSINESS AND IN SPORTS FOR WOMEN TO BECOME ONE OF GEORGE'S MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSWOMAN EVER. AND SHE, TOO WAS WILLING TO STEP FORWARD AND SERVE THIS STATE AND I CAN TELL YOU EVERY DAY SHE HAS BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, SHE HAS BEEN AN UNAPOLOGETIC CHAMPION OF OUR AGENDA AND THE CONSERVATIVE VALUES THAT MAKE GEORGIA STRAIGHT, SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT LEADERSHIP. [APPLAUSE] SO IT IS ABOUT WHO THEY ARE, BUT ALSO ABOUT EVERYTHING WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WITH ALLIES LIKE THESE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. IT IS AMAZING TO THINK ALL WE HAVE DONE, FOUR YEARS AGO WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT BY DEVASTATING BUDGET CUT, AND ECONOMY STRUGGLING TO BREAK OUT OF THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, TERRORISM WAS ON THE RISE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND WE WITNESS TO STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR MOST CHERISHED VALUES. BUT WITH THESE ALLIES, AND UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF DONALD TRUMP, WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE REVIVED OUR ECONOMY, WE SECURED OUR BORDER, STOOD WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND FOUGHT FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE USA. [APPLAUSE] EVERYTHING STARTS WITH OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE, YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE DEFENSE FAMILY , THE PENCE FAMILY IS A BIT OF A MILITARY FAMILY. I AM PROUD TO SAY MY SON IS A CAPTAIN IN THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS. AND ONE OF MY TWO UNWORTHY SON IN LAWS AS A LIEUTENANT IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY CURRENTLY DEPLOYED IN SERVING OUR NATION. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE A PRESIDENT WHO CARES SO DEEPLY ABOUT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR ARMED FORCES. PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH A STRONG SUPPORT OF OUR ALLIES IN CONGRESS SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASE IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN, WE ARE FINALLY GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, AND COAST GUARD THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DEFEND THIS NATION. AND LET ME SAY AS WE RESTORE THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY, FROM THE SEAT ON THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, SENATOR DAVID PERDUE HAS BEEN THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THOSE WHO SERVE, BUT ALSO ABOUT ALL OF YOU WHO DID SERVE IN THE UNIFORM IN THE UNITED STATES. IN FACT, STANDING IN THIS PATRIOTIC CROWD I'M CONFIDENT THERE IS A LOT OF WOMEN AND MEN THAT SERVED IN OUR ARMED FORCES, SO IF YOU WOULD NOT MIND IF YOU ARE A VETERAN, WOULD YOU PUT YOUR HAND IN THE AIR AND GIVE US A CHANCE TO THANK YOU ONE MORE TIME? [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR OUR FREEDOM. WE ALL REMEMBER ESPECIALLY THESE VETERANS UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, WE SAW YEARS OF SCANDAL WITH THE V.A. THAT SHOCKED THE CONSCIOUS OF THE NATION, BUT WITH A STRONG SUPPORT FROM HER SEAT ON THE VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER WAS THERE AS PRESIDENT TRUMP IMPLEMENTED THE MOST SWEEPING REFORMS IN YEARS, WE FIRED 10,000 V.A. EMPLOYEES THAT WERE NOT GIVING OUR VETERANS THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY EARNED AND VETERANS CHOICE IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR EVERY VETERAN IN AMERICA, THANK YOU SENATOR. AND WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE HAVE STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES AND STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES ALL THESE LAST FOUR YEARS. WITH THE DIRECTION OF OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, OUR ARMED FORCES TOOK DOWN THE LAST INCHES OF TERRITORY UNDER THE BLACK FLAG OF ISIS AND ELIMINATED THEIR LEADER WITHOUT ONE AMERICAN CASUALTY. WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF BOTH OF YOUR SENATORS, THIS PRESIDENT STOOD STRONG AGAINST IRAN, WE GOT OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR AND THE IRANIAN GENERAL IS GONE. [APPLAUSE] SO WE STOOD STRONG AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD THREATEN OUR FREEDOM AND OUR PEACE, BUT WE HAVE ALSO STOOD WITH OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLY LIKE NEVER BEFORE. AFTER FOR PRESIDENT IN A ROW PROMISED AND DID NOT DO IT, IT WAS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHO KEPT HIS WORD AND MOVED TO THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. SO IT HAS BEEN ABOUT OUR SECURITY, BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT PROSPERITY THESE LAST FOUR YEARS AND AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREATEST , GREAT DEPRESSION, WORKING WITH THE SENATORS, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP REVIVED OUR ECONOMY, WE CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD, WE ROLLED BACK REGULATION AT A HISTORIC PACE, WE FOUGHT FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE, UNLEASED AMERICAN ENERGY AND IN THREE SHORT YEARS, BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED SEVEN MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS. AND EVEN IN THIS CHALLENGING YEAR AFTER LOSING 22 MILLION JOBS AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC, ON THAT STRONG FOUNDATION WITH OUR ALLIES INTO CONGRESS AND THE UNPRECEDENTED RECOVERY AND RELIEF EFFORTS FOR FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES THAT THE SENATORS PROVIDED, WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN MORE THAN 12 MILLION AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK INCLUDING 350,000 PEOPLE RIGHT HERE IN THE PEACH STATE. AND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER WHERE THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, BEYOND OUR PROSPERITY AND BEYOND OUR SECURITY, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO STAND WITH TWO LEADERS AND SERVE WITH THE PRESIDENT WHO HAS STOOD EVERY DAY WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED ON THE THIN BLUE LINE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP, DAVID PERDUE, AND KELLY LOEFFLER WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. BEYOND THAT, WE HAVE SUPPORTED THE RULE OF LAW AS NEVER BEFORE AND THIS IS WHERE THE SENATE LOOMS SO LARGE. THE PRESIDENT NOMINATES MEN AND WOMEN TO SERVE IN OUR FEDERAL COURTS, BUT IT IS THE SENATE THAT CONFIRMS. WORKING WITH GEORGIAN SENATORS, WE HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN MORE THAN 220 CONSERVATIVES APPOINTED TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS AT EVERY LEVEL AND THEY ARE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [APPLAUSE] 220 JUDGES INCLUDING JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH, JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH, AND JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT. ISN'T SHE GREAT? I MEAN, IN HER CONFIRMATION HEARING HOW MUCH DID YOU LOVE IT WHEN THEY SAID, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT WRITTEN ON THAT PAPER IN FRONT OF YOU? NOTHING. AN AMAZING PERSON, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THE SENATORS WERE THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FULFILLED HIS DUTY TO FILL THAT SEAT, IN FACT, LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK SENATOR LOEFFLER, SHE WAS THE FIRST MEMBER OF THE SENATE TO CALL FOR A CONFIRMATION VOTE OF JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT. THANK YOU, SENATOR. [APPLAUSE] IN A STRONG JUDICIARY, VANGUARD AND THE SENATE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. YOU ALL REMEMBER IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, THE STEADY ASSAULT OF OUR MOST CHERISHED LIBERTIES INCLUDING THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY COMPROMISED TO THE CONSCIOUS RIGHTS OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND RELIGIOUS CHARITIES. THEY ACTUALLY HAULED THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR INTO FEDERAL COURT TO FORCE THEM TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH TO LIVE UNDER THE MANDATE OF OBAMA CARE. YOU ALL MIGHT REMEMBER WHEN JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT WAS BEING CONFIRMED A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE DEMOCRAT LEADER OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ACTUALLY SAID SHE WAS CONCERNED BECAUSE OF JUDGE BARRETT'S SINCERE CATHOLIC FAITH. SHE SAID AND I QUOTE, THE DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY WITHIN YOU. AND THEIR FRIENDS IN HOLLYWOOD HAVE BEEN ATTACKING JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT ENTER VALUES EVER SENT , SINCE. I HAVE GOT A MESSAGE FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON AND THEIR FRIENDS IN HOLLYWOOD AND THE TWO DEMOCRATS THAT ARE TRYING TO JOIN THEM FROM HERE IN GEORGIA. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN ME. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN YOU. IN THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND WORSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF OUR FAITH LIVE LOUDLY IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT IS WHY , ONE MORE REASON WHY WE NEED THESE TWO GREAT SENATORS BACK IN THE SENATE. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH, PROSPERITY, SECURITY, STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION UNDER OUR LIBERTIES. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, MAYBE MOST OF ALL, I CANNOT BE MORE PROUD TO BE STANDING TODAY WITH TWO MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND WITH A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF GEORGIA FOR WHO THEY ARE, FOR ALL THAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED, WE NEED SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER BACK IN A MAJORITY IN THE SENATE, WE NEED GEORGIA TO DEFEND THE MAJORITY ON JANUARY 5, 2021. ARE YOU WITH ME? [APPLAUSE] I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION. THE CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER, FOR DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER STAND FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE, THE OTHERS WILL CUT THE NATIONAL DEFENSE TO FUND A BIG GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION, DEMOCRATS WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT DEEP CUTS IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE TO FUND THEIR NEW BIG GOVERNMENT PROJECTS. AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK HAS DEMEANED OUR MILITARY, HE REPEATEDLY HAS DEFENDED ANTI-SEMITIC RHETORIC AND EVEN RIDICULED OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLIES ISRAEL. AND WHERE THE SENATORS CUT TAXES, THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP DEFENDING THE RIGHT TO KEEP MORE OF WHAT YOU EARN, JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK WANT TO RAISE TAXES ON WORKING FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL. AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK ARE TALKING ABOUT DEFUNDING THE POLICE, DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. [APPLAUSE] AND WERE JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK WANTS TO SUPPORT ACTIVIST JUDGES WHO WILL LITERALLY LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH AND SUPPORT TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, DAVID AND KELLY WILL STAND FOR THE PRINCIPLES IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND THE RIGHT TO LIFE EVERY SINGLE DAY. [APPLAUSE] YOU ALL NOTE THE STAKES HERE IN GEORGIA , KNOW THE STAKES HERE IN GEORGIA. CHUCK SCHUMER SAID THE OTHER DATE NOW WE TAKE GEORGIA, THEN WE CHANGE AMERICA. I HAVE GOT A MESSAGE FOR CHUCK SCHUMER AND THE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP GEORGIA AND WE ARE GOING TO SAVE AMERICA. OUR AGENDA IS AMERICAN GREATNESS , THEIR AGENDA IS AMERICAN DECLINE. WHERE WE ARE OPENING UP AMERICA, I FROM US YOU THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOCKING DOWN AMERICA IF THEY GET HALF A CHANCE. IN FACT, REMEMBER WHEN THE DEMOCRATS SAID IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A VACCINE BY THE END OF THE YEAR? I HAVE GOT A NEWSFLASH FOR YOU FOLKS, PFIZER TURNED THEIR VACCINE OVER TO THE FDA TODAY. BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR, WE ARE GOING TO SEE 40 MILLION VACCINES ALL ACROSS AMERICA, THAT IS THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WE ARE IN THE MIRACLE BUSINESS. YOU ALL KNOW JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK'S AGENDA IS HIGHER TAXES, OPEN BORDERS, SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, GREEN NEW DEAL, ABORTION ON DEMAND, DEFUNDING THE POLICE, AND PACKING THE COURTS. JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK ARE WRONG FOR GEORGIA AND WRONG FOR AMERICA, THAT IS RIGHT , WHY WE NEED GEORGIA TO SAY NO TO THEM AND YES TO SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER ON JANUARY 5. SO GEORGIA, I CAME HERE TODAY TO SAY STAY IN THE FIGHT. STAY IN THE FIGHT FOR THE INTEGRITY IN THE SELECTION. STAY IN THE FIGHT TO DEFEND THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY AND STAY IN THE FIGHT UNTIL THE POLLS CLOSE ON JANUARY 5 AND WE SEND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER BACK TO A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THAT IS WHY I GOT ON THE BUS TODAY, THAT IS WHY HEADED YOUR WAY TO STAND WITH THESE TWO GREAT LEADERS, TO STAND WITH ALL OF YOU. I HAVE GOT A COUPLE THINGS TO ASK YOU TO DO IN THE WEEK AHEAD , WEEKS AHEAD, FIRST THING I NEED YOU TO DO IS VOTE, GEORGIA.

IN PERSON VOTING STARTS DECEMBER 14, MY LAST STOP , THEY SAY THE LOCAL OFFICE OPENS AT 8:30, SO LET ME ASK OF YOU THAT CAME TO THIS RODEO TODAY, GRAB A NEIGHBOR, FAMILY MEMBER, REMEMBER, FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS VOTE ALONE. GET OUT AND VOTE TO REELECT DAVID AND KELLY, THE MOMENT THEY OPEN EARLY VOTING. AND SECONDLY, I WANT YOU TO TELL SOMEONE WHY YOU CAME OUT TODAY AND WHY YOU FEEL SO PASSIONATE. THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA DESERVE TO KNOW JUST HOW IMPORTANT THIS ELECTION IS. WE NEED YOU TO STAY IN THE FIGHT AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO STAY IN THE FIGHT, GEORGIA WILL LOOM LARGE IN THE FUTURE OF THIS SENATE, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. I KNOW GEORGE IS UP TO THE TASK, I KNOW GEORGIA IS GOING TO HOLD THE LINE. [APPLAUSE] SO VOTE AS SOON AS YOU CAN. TELL A FRIEND, THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION. FINALLY I ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE FAITH. [APPLAUSE] HAVE FAITH IN OUR PRESIDENT. WHO MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING TO MAKE AMERICA GREATER STILL. HAVE FAITH IN LEADERS LIKE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER. MEN AND WOMEN OF INTEGRITY WHO WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE OFF THEY STAND FOR PRINCIPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY. THEY DEFEND GEORGE'S VALUES , GEORGE'S VALUES , GERO HAVE FAITH IN THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT STATE. I BELIEVE THE CAREFUL STUDY OF HISTORY SHOWS THAT EVERY TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN A SEIZURE OF MORE FREEDOM , FUTURE OF MORE FREEDOM AND A FUTURE OF LESS FREEDOM, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CHOOSE FREEDOM EVERY TIME, SO GO TELL THEM FREEDOM IS ON THE BALLOT. AND FINALLY, FINALLY I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE THAT OTHER KIND OF FAITH AS WELL. SOMEBODY SENT ME A QUOTE THE OTHER DAY, IT SAID YOU CAN TRUST AN UNKNOWN FUTURE TO A KNOWN GOD . WE MAY NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS, BUT WE KNOW WHO HOLDS THE FUTURE. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO AVAIL YOURSELVES IN THESE DAYS OF THAT WELLSPRING OF FAITH THAT THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA AND AMERICA HAVE ALWAYS DRAWN IN MUCH MORE CHALLENGING TIMES AND WE LIVE IN TODAY.

LIKE A SON OF MACON WHO AFTER HIGH SCHOOL ENROLLED IN GEORGIA TECH, PAID HIS WAY THROUGH COLLEGE BY WORKING WAREHOUSE AND CONSTRUCTION JOBS, HE EVENTUALLY WOULD PUT TOGETHER AN EXTRAORDINARY CAREER IN BUSINESS, REACH THE TOP OF THE BUSINESS WORLD. A FORTY-YEAR SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS CAREER, BUT HE IS A MAN OF FAITH, HE FELT A CALLING TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND HE STEPPED FORWARD SIX YEARS AGO AND I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND, HE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE GREATEST ALLIES OF OUR AGENDA AND A PRESENT , OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND WASHINGTON, D.C. WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING SENATOR DAVID PERDUE? 2 , INCREDIBLE MAN, A CHAMPION FOR GEORGE AND GEORGE'S VALUES. JUST LIKE ANOTHER LEADER, FOURTH JANUARY , GENERATION ON HER FAMILY'S FARM. SHE BUILT HER OWN COMPANY FROM THE GROUND APPEAR IN GEORGIA, SHE MADE HISTORY BREAKING THEIR YEARS BUSINESS AND IN SPORTS FOR WOMEN TO BECOME ONE OF GEORGE'S MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSWOMAN EVER. AND SHE, TOO WAS WILLING TO STEP FORWARD AND SERVE THIS STATE AND I CAN TELL YOU EVERY DAY SHE HAS BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, SHE HAS BEEN AN UNAPOLOGETIC CHAMPION OF OUR AGENDA AND THE CONSERVATIVE VALUES THAT MAKE GEORGIA STRAIGHT, SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT LEADERSHIP. SO IT IS ABOUT WHO THEY ARE, BUT ALSO ABOUT EVERYTHING WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WITH ALLIES LIKE THESE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. IT IS AMAZING TO THINK ALL WE HAVE DONE, FOUR YEARS AGO WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT BY DEVASTATING BUDGET CUT, AND ECONOMY STRUGGLING TO BREAK OUT OF THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, TERRORISM WAS ON THE RISE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND WE WITNESS TO STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR MOST CHERISHED VALUES. BUT WITH THESE ALLIES, AND UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF DONALD TRUMP, WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE REVIVED OUR ECONOMY, WE SECURED OUR BORDER, STOOD WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND FOUGHT FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE USA. EVERYTHING STARTS WITH OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE, YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE DEFENSE FAMILY , THE PENCE FAMILY IS A BIT OF A MILITARY FAMILY. I AM PROUD TO SAY MY SON IS A CAPTAIN IN THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS. AND ONE OF MY TWO UNWORTHY SON IN LAWS AS A LIEUTENANT IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY CURRENTLY DEPLOYED IN SERVING OUR NATION. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE A PRESIDENT WHO CARES SO DEEPLY ABOUT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR ARMED FORCES. PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH A STRONG SUPPORT OF OUR ALLIES IN CONGRESS SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASE IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN, WE ARE FINALLY GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, AND COAST GUARD THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DEFEND THIS NATION. AND LET ME SAY AS WE RESTORE THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY, FROM THE SEAT ON THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, SENATOR DAVID PERDUE HAS BEEN THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THOSE WHO SERVE, BUT ALSO ABOUT ALL OF YOU WHO DID SERVE IN THE UNIFORM IN THE UNITED STATES. IN FACT, STANDING IN THIS PATRIOTIC CROWD I'M CONFIDENT THERE IS A LOT OF WOMEN AND MEN THAT SERVED IN OUR ARMED FORCES, SO IF YOU WOULD NOT MIND IF YOU ARE A VETERAN, WOULD YOU PUT YOUR HAND IN THE AIR AND GIVE US A CHANCE TO THANK YOU ONE MORE TIME? THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR OUR FREEDOM. WE ALL REMEMBER ESPECIALLY THESE VETERANS UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, WE SAW YEARS OF SCANDAL WITH THE V.A. THAT SHOCKED THE CONSCIOUS OF THE NATION, BUT WITH A STRONG SUPPORT FROM HER SEAT ON THE VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER WAS THERE AS PRESIDENT TRUMP IMPLEMENTED THE MOST SWEEPING REFORMS IN YEARS, WE FIRED 10,000 V.A. EMPLOYEES THAT WERE NOT GIVING OUR VETERANS THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY EARNED AND VETERANS CHOICE IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR EVERY VETERAN IN AMERICA, THANK YOU SENATOR. AND WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE HAVE STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES AND STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES ALL THESE LAST FOUR YEARS. WITH THE DIRECTION OF OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, OUR ARMED FORCES TOOK DOWN THE LAST INCHES OF TERRITORY UNDER THE BLACK FLAG OF ISIS AND ELIMINATED THEIR LEADER WITHOUT ONE AMERICAN CASUALTY. WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF BOTH OF YOUR SENATORS, THIS PRESIDENT STOOD STRONG AGAINST IRAN, WE GOT OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR AND THE IRANIAN GENERAL IS GONE. SO WE STOOD STRONG AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD THREATEN OUR FREEDOM AND OUR PEACE, BUT WE HAVE ALSO STOOD WITH OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLY LIKE NEVER BEFORE. AFTER FOR PRESIDENT IN A ROW PROMISED AND DID NOT DO IT, IT WAS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHO KEPT HIS WORD AND MOVED TO THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. SO IT HAS BEEN ABOUT OUR SECURITY, BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT PROSPERITY THESE LAST FOUR YEARS AND AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREATEST , GREAT DEPRESSION, WORKING WITH THE SENATORS, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP REVIVED OUR ECONOMY, WE CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD, WE ROLLED BACK REGULATION AT A HISTORIC PACE, WE FOUGHT FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE, UNLEASED AMERICAN ENERGY AND IN THREE SHORT YEARS, BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED SEVEN MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS. AND EVEN IN THIS CHALLENGING YEAR AFTER LOSING 22 MILLION JOBS AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC, ON THAT STRONG FOUNDATION WITH OUR ALLIES INTO CONGRESS AND THE UNPRECEDENTED RECOVERY AND RELIEF EFFORTS FOR FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES THAT THE SENATORS PROVIDED, WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN MORE THAN 12 MILLION AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK INCLUDING 350,000 PEOPLE RIGHT HERE IN THE PEACH STATE. AND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER WHERE THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, BEYOND OUR PROSPERITY AND BEYOND OUR SECURITY, I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO STAND WITH TWO LEADERS AND SERVE WITH THE PRESIDENT WHO HAS STOOD EVERY DAY WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED ON THE THIN BLUE LINE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP, DAVID PERDUE, AND KELLY LOEFFLER WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. BEYOND THAT, WE HAVE SUPPORTED THE RULE OF LAW AS NEVER BEFORE AND THIS IS WHERE THE SENATE LOOMS SO LARGE. THE PRESIDENT NOMINATES MEN AND WOMEN TO SERVE IN OUR FEDERAL COURTS, BUT IT IS THE SENATE THAT CONFIRMS. WORKING WITH GEORGIAN SENATORS, WE HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN MORE THAN 220 CONSERVATIVES APPOINTED TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS AT EVERY LEVEL AND THEY ARE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. 220 JUDGES INCLUDING JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH, JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH, AND JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT. ISN'T SHE GREAT? I MEAN, IN HER CONFIRMATION HEARING HOW MUCH DID YOU LOVE IT WHEN THEY SAID, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT WRITTEN ON THAT PAPER IN FRONT OF YOU? NOTHING. AN AMAZING PERSON, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THE SENATORS WERE THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FULFILLED HIS DUTY TO FILL THAT SEAT, IN FACT, LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK SENATOR LOEFFLER, SHE WAS THE FIRST MEMBER OF THE SENATE TO CALL FOR A CONFIRMATION VOTE OF JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT. THANK YOU, SENATOR. IN A STRONG JUDICIARY, VANGUARD AND THE SENATE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. YOU ALL REMEMBER IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, THE STEADY ASSAULT OF OUR MOST CHERISHED LIBERTIES INCLUDING THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY COMPROMISED TO THE CONSCIOUS RIGHTS OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND RELIGIOUS CHARITIES. THEY ACTUALLY HAULED THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR INTO FEDERAL COURT TO FORCE THEM TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH TO LIVE UNDER THE MANDATE OF OBAMA CARE. YOU ALL MIGHT REMEMBER WHEN JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT WAS BEING CONFIRMED A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE DEMOCRAT LEADER OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ACTUALLY SAID SHE WAS CONCERNED BECAUSE OF JUDGE BARRETT'S SINCERE CATHOLIC FAITH. SHE SAID AND I QUOTE, THE DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY WITHIN YOU. AND THEIR FRIENDS IN HOLLYWOOD HAVE BEEN ATTACKING JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT ENTER VALUES EVER SENT , SINCE. I HAVE GOT A MESSAGE FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON AND THEIR FRIENDS IN HOLLYWOOD AND THE TWO DEMOCRATS THAT ARE TRYING TO JOIN THEM FROM HERE IN GEORGIA. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN ME. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN YOU. IN THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND WORSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF OUR FAITH LIVE LOUDLY IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT IS WHY , ONE MORE REASON WHY WE NEED THESE TWO GREAT SENATORS BACK IN THE SENATE. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH, PROSPERITY, SECURITY, STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION UNDER OUR LIBERTIES. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, MAYBE MOST OF ALL, I CANNOT BE MORE PROUD TO BE STANDING TODAY WITH TWO MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND WITH A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF GEORGIA FOR WHO THEY ARE, FOR ALL THAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED, WE NEED SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER BACK IN A MAJORITY IN THE SENATE, WE NEED GEORGIA TO DEFEND THE MAJORITY ON JANUARY 5, 2021. ARE YOU WITH ME? I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION. THE CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER, FOR DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER STAND FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE, THE OTHERS WILL CUT THE NATIONAL DEFENSE TO FUND A BIG GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION, DEMOCRATS WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT DEEP CUTS IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE TO FUND THEIR NEW BIG GOVERNMENT PROJECTS. AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK HAS DEMEANED OUR MILITARY, HE REPEATEDLY HAS DEFENDED ANTI-SEMITIC RHETORIC AND EVEN RIDICULED OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLIES ISRAEL. AND WHERE THE SENATORS CUT TAXES, THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP DEFENDING THE RIGHT TO KEEP MORE OF WHAT YOU EARN, JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK WANT TO RAISE TAXES ON WORKING FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL. AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK ARE TALKING ABOUT DEFUNDING THE POLICE, DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER WILL ALWAYS BACK THE BLUE. AND WERE JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK WANTS TO SUPPORT ACTIVIST JUDGES WHO WILL LITERALLY LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH AND SUPPORT TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, DAVID AND KELLY WILL STAND FOR THE PRINCIPLES IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND THE RIGHT TO LIFE EVERY SINGLE DAY. YOU ALL NOTE THE STAKES HERE IN GEORGIA , KNOW THE STAKES HERE IN GEORGIA. CHUCK SCHUMER SAID THE OTHER DATE NOW WE TAKE GEORGIA, THEN WE CHANGE AMERICA. I HAVE GOT A MESSAGE FOR CHUCK SCHUMER AND THE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP GEORGIA AND WE ARE GOING TO SAVE AMERICA. OUR AGENDA IS AMERICAN GREATNESS , THEIR AGENDA IS AMERICAN DECLINE. WHERE WE ARE OPENING UP AMERICA, I FROM US YOU THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOCKING DOWN AMERICA IF THEY GET HALF A CHANCE. IN FACT, REMEMBER WHEN THE DEMOCRATS SAID IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A VACCINE BY THE END OF THE YEAR? I HAVE GOT A NEWSFLASH FOR YOU FOLKS, PFIZER TURNED THEIR VACCINE OVER TO THE FDA TODAY. BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR, WE ARE GOING TO SEE 40 MILLION VACCINES ALL ACROSS AMERICA, THAT IS THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WE ARE IN THE MIRACLE BUSINESS.

CSPANMP4122020173	Mike Pence	2020-12-04	Vice President Pence Campaigns for Georgia Republican Senate Candidates	Speech	Well, hello Georgia. The senator, David Perdue. Our great Republican, National Chair, Ronna Mcdaniel to the hometown congressman. Buddy, carter to our great friend, congressman. Doug Collins. Yeah. Bubba Mcdonald, State Chair, David Shafer. My fellow americans. It is great to be back in the peach state. Thank you all for coming out on this beautiful day. But before I begin, I know we were all just informed that a young man on Senator kelly Leffler staff lost his life in a fatal car accident this afternoon. Senator Leffler is on her way back to Atlanta to support that young man's family and her staff in this difficult hour and she goes with our prayers and our deepest sympathies for his family, her staff and all of those impacted by today's tragic loss of a truly wonderful young man. God bless them all. Thank you. But it is great to be with so many friends here in Georgia. And speaking of friends of mine, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine. Yeah. Mhm. A man who has been fighting every day to keep the promises that he made to the people of Georgia. I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America. President Donald Trump. Right, I'm here because I stand with President Donald trump and I'm here because we stand with Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler. But I have to tell you, I told the president this morning that I was headed to Georgia and he told me I'm gonna be there tomorrow. And we're here to we're here to stand with two extraordinary leaders. And we're here also to express our gratitude for the support of the people of Georgia over the past four years And over the past four weeks. It's amazing to think about it with your support. President Trump received more than 74 million votes across America. More than 10 million than 2016. We received the greatest share of minority votes of any Republican in the last 60 years and we added more than a dozen seats to the United States Congress And as our election contest continue here in Georgia and in courts across the country, I'll make you a promise we're going to keep fighting until every legal vote is counted. We're going to keep fighting until every illegal vote is thrown out. Yeah. And we will never stop fighting to make America great again. That's why president trump and I need David Perdue and kelly Leffler back in the Republican majority in the United States Senate. For all we've done for all we have yet to do. We need the peach state to defend the majority because the road to the Senate, Republican majority runs right through the state of Georgia. Are you with me? You know, there's never a dull moment at a trump rally, is there? Yeah, Yeah. Men and women of the peach state. I'm here on the president's behalf because we need Georgia to send two great senators back to Republican majority in Washington. We need to send them back because of who they are. We need to send it back because of all that we accomplished together and we need to send them back because the Republican Senate majority could be the last line of defense preserving all that we've done to defend this nation, revive our economy and preserve the God given liberties we hold dear. But I'm here because of who they are. David Perdue is a son of making worked his way to the top of the business world. But he answered the call to public service After spending 40 years is one of the most successful business leaders in America. He decided to serve Georgia and I can tell you firsthand, he's a principled conservative, a man of deep conviction and faith. And Senator. David Perdue has been one of the greatest allies of our administration in Washington, D. C. And another incredible leader, Kelly Leffler, 4th Generation, on her family's grain farm. She built her own company up from the ground. She broke barriers in business and sports to become one of Georgia's most successful business women. And I can tell you again, in a very short period of time, she has emerged as one of the most important conservative voices on capitol Hill. We need senator kelly Leffler back in Washington, D. C. So we support your senators because of who they are, but also because of everything that we've done with their support. I mean, think about it four years ago, we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise around the world and we witnessed a steadyault on our most cherished values. But with your two senators and under President Donald trump, we rebuilt our military, we revive our economy. We secured our border, stood with law enforcement and fought for life and liberty and the constitution of the United States of America. Yeah. And everything starts with our national defense. You know, I'm your vice president but highest title I'll ever hold is D A. D wow. Okay. And I'm the proud father of a United States Marine and the father in law of a navy pilot. And I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces. President trump has signed the largest investments in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. Mhm I mean the truth is we're finally given our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guard the support they need to defend this nation. And Senator David Perdue from his seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee has been there every step of the way. Thank you senator. So it's been about standing with those who served but also standing with all of you who did serve in the uniform of the United States. You know, the last administration saw years of scandal at the V. A. That shocked the conscience of the nation. Do you remember I mean, we literally had veterans in this country passing away, waiting for care at via hospitals in this country. But when President trump came into office With the help of your two senators, those days are over. President Trump signed the most sweeping reforms of the via in 50 years. We fired 10,000 via employees that weren't giving our veterans the care that they earned and veterans choices now available for every veteran in America. And from her seat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator kelly Leffler was there every step of the way And with our renewed american strength the last four years, we've stood up to our enemies and stood with our allies at the direction of Commander in chief. Our armed forces took down the last inch of territory under the black flag of ISIS eliminated their leader and Qasem Soleimani is gone. Yeah, we stood with those who threaten us. But we've stood with our most cherished ally. Like never before. After four different presidents made the promise and broke it. It was President donald trump who kept his promise and moved the american embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel. Oh, so it's been about security, standing strong in the world. It's also been about our prosperity. And again your senators have been there every step of the way. After the slowest recovery. In some 75 years, President trump revived the american economy. We cut taxes, we roll back regulation. We fought for free and fair trade unleashed American energy and in three short years businesses large and small created seven million good paying jobs, including 350,000 jobs right here in the Peach state. And your senators were there every step of the way, especially in this challenging year through which we passed. It's amazing to think in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. It was a moment in which we lost 22 million jobs. But because of the strong foundation that both of Georgia senators supported, We've already seen more than 12 million Americans go back to work. We're opening up America again. I mean the response to this pandemic, I must tell you, serving alongside this president, been deeply inspiring to me as an american. With the support of your two senators, we launched the greatest national mobilization since World War Two. We secured financial support for families and businesses. And while the other side said it would take a miracle to get a vaccine. Before the end of the year, we just heard the CDC in Atlanta, we're about a week and a half away from starting to distribute tens of millions of doses of a safe and effective vaccine. America is in the miracle business and David Perdue and kelly Leffler were there every day of this challenging year. But when it comes to the rule of law, I couldn't be more proud to report to you with the strong support of these senators. We've confirmed more than 220 Conservative judges to our federal courts at every level and they are all men and women who will uphold the God given liberties enshrined in our constitution, like the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And none of that would have been possible without the consistent support and vote of Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler. It was Georgia, senators who were there when we confirmed justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice. Amy coney Barrett. Yeah. In fact, Senator kelly Leffler was the first member of the United States Senate to call for the immediate confirmation of Justice Amy coney Barrett. And it couldn't be more important than it is right now. I think you all understand a strong judiciary is the vanguard of our liberties under the last administration. You remember how our values and our freedoms were under assault in the last administration actually was trampling on the religious liberty of americans on a regular basis. They compromise the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and of religious charities. They even called the little sisters of the poor into federal court to force them to compromise their faith to live under the mandates of Obamacare. In fact, we saw that religious intolerance two years ago when Amy coney Barrett went before the Judiciary Committee the first time the leading democrat on the committee actually said she was concerned because of Amy coney Barrett, sincere christian faith, she said. And I quote, the dogma lives loudly within you and Hollywood liberals have been ridicule and Amy coney barrett ever since. Well, I got news for the democrats in Washington and their friends in Hollywood, that dogma lives loudly in me, that dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the Constitution of the United States of America. So for our liberties, for our freedoms, we need Senator David Perdue and kelly Leffler back in a Republican majority in the United States Senate. Yeah, yeah. Near the stakes in this election has never been higher. The choice has never been clearer where David Perdue and kelly Leffler stand for a strong national defense, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are gonna cut in our national defense to fund their big government programs. Where David Perdue and kelly Leffler cut taxes, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock want to raise taxes on working families and businesses large and small. Mhm. Where David Perdue and kelly Leffler support our military. Raphael Warnock has demeaned our military and repeatedly defended the anti Semitic rhetoric of reverend Jeremiah wright, and where Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock support taxpayer funding of abortion. David Perdue and kelly Leffler stand for the right to life. Mhm. I mean, you all know what the stakes are here in Georgia, chuck, schumer said it couldn't have said it more clearly. He said, quote now we take Georgia then we change America. I got a message for chuck schumer and the Washington democrats. We're going to keep Georgia, We're going to save the senate and then we're gonna save America. You know, our agenda is american greatness. Their agenda is american decline, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock's agenda of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine. A green new deal defunding the police and packing the courts. It's wrong for Georgia and Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are wrong for Georgia and wrong for America. That's why we need Georgia to say no to us off and Warnock and yes to Senator David Perdue and Senator Kelly Leffler on January five. So George, I came here today to say stay in the fight, Stay in the fight for integrity in our elections. Mhm, and stay in the fight to defend the republican majority in the Senate. Stay in the fight until the polls close on January five and we sent David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to a Republican majority. I mean to keep America great everybody, that's what's on the line to preserve the progress that we've made to protect our values and our liberties. We need you to vote Georgia. We need you to vote to send Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler back to Washington, D. C. Yeah, it all starts now. They've got a few things to ask you to do before I get back on that airplane.

Don't wait fill it out and turn it in. And if you don't want to vote by mail in person, voting starts Monday, 14.

They'll be open on the 14th, Monday through Friday. And remember friends. Don't let friends vote alone, bring a family member, bring a neighbor and vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to Washington, D. C. So between now and when the polls close on January five, we need you to vote George and we need you tell everybody to get it done. I know we've all got our doubts about the last election. And I actually hear some people saying, just don't vote my fellow americans. If you don't vote, they win. If you don't vote, there could be nothing to stop chuck schumer and nancy. Pelosi from cutting our military, raising taxes and passing the agenda of the radical left. Yeah. For all we've done for all we have yet to do for our president and our future for Georgia and America cast another vote for all that president trump has accomplished. Vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to the United States Senate. And I promise you we're going to keep on fighting and we know this. We can fight for our president and we can fight for more republicans in the Senate. At the same time, we have done both. We're going to keep doing both. We're gonna make America great again. The vote Georgia. Yeah. And after you vote I absentee or early voting or even on Election Day? Do what Ronald Mcdaniel. Just challenge you to do. Go tell somebody what the stakes are and tell them what's on the line here. Tell me about the progress that we've made over the last four years and all that we can continue to do to make this country safe and secure and strong and prosperous and free. I mean, here's the deal Georgia. It might all come down to you. Yeah. Are you with me? Go tell your neighbors and friends and worshipping at work. So I ran into mike out at the airport. David Perdue was there and Ronald Mcdaniel doug Collins. And these people are all fired up. But the key is We've got to bring it all together. Georgia's got to bring it. Georgia's got to hold the line on January five. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. And finally as you leave here today, I hope you tell people what we talked about, share the same passion you shared with all of us. Tell them what the stakes are telling the difference that one vote can make here in the state of Georgia and have faith. You know we may not know what the future holds but we know who holds the future. Yeah. So finally in these challenging times in the life of our nation, I'd encourage you to avail yourself of that wellspring of strength from which the people of this state and this nation have drawn throughout our history and when you do so remember that ancient promise that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn that he'll do like he's always done throughout the long and storied history of this state and this nation, he'll hear from heaven and he'll he'll this lamp, this one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America. It'll make a difference. And I just know if all of us do all that we need to do Between now and January five, I know if you vote Georgia, you vote your values, you vote your convictions. If you vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to a Republican majority in the United States Senate. If we stand with president, donald trump until every legal vote is counted. Yeah. Yeah. I just know there was support of people across this state and with God's help we'll keep on winning. Yeah, we'll defend the vote, we'll defend the Senate and we will keep making America great again. Thank you very much. Georgia. God bless you. God bless America now let's go get it done.	Well, hello Georgia. The senator, David Perdue. Our great Republican, National Chair, Ronna Mcdaniel to the hometown congressman. Buddy, carter to our great friend, congressman. Doug Collins. Yeah. Bubba Mcdonald, State Chair, David Shafer. My fellow americans. It is great to be back in the peach state. Thank you all for coming out on this beautiful day. But before I begin, I know we were all just informed that a young man on Senator kelly Leffler staff lost his life in a fatal car accident this afternoon. Senator Leffler is on her way back to Atlanta to support that young man's family and her staff in this difficult hour and she goes with our prayers and our deepest sympathies for his family, her staff and all of those impacted by today's tragic loss of a truly wonderful young man. God bless them all. Thank you. But it is great to be with so many friends here in Georgia. And speaking of friends of mine, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine. Yeah. Mhm. A man who has been fighting every day to keep the promises that he made to the people of Georgia. I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America. President Donald Trump. Right, I'm here because I stand with President Donald trump and I'm here because we stand with Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler. But I have to tell you, I told the president this morning that I was headed to Georgia and he told me I'm gonna be there tomorrow. And we're here to we're here to stand with two extraordinary leaders. And we're here also to express our gratitude for the support of the people of Georgia over the past four years And over the past four weeks. It's amazing to think about it with your support. President Trump received more than 74 million votes across America. More than 10 million than 2016. We received the greatest share of minority votes of any Republican in the last 60 years and we added more than a dozen seats to the United States Congress And as our election contest continue here in Georgia and in courts across the country, I'll make you a promise we're going to keep fighting until every legal vote is counted. We're going to keep fighting until every illegal vote is thrown out. Yeah. And we will never stop fighting to make America great again. That's why president trump and I need David Perdue and kelly Leffler back in the Republican majority in the United States Senate. For all we've done for all we have yet to do. We need the peach state to defend the majority because the road to the Senate, Republican majority runs right through the state of Georgia. Are you with me? You know, there's never a dull moment at a trump rally, is there? Yeah, Yeah. Men and women of the peach state. I'm here on the president's behalf because we need Georgia to send two great senators back to Republican majority in Washington. We need to send them back because of who they are. We need to send it back because of all that we accomplished together and we need to send them back because the Republican Senate majority could be the last line of defense preserving all that we've done to defend this nation, revive our economy and preserve the God given liberties we hold dear. But I'm here because of who they are. David Perdue is a son of making worked his way to the top of the business world. But he answered the call to public service After spending 40 years is one of the most successful business leaders in America. He decided to serve Georgia and I can tell you firsthand, he's a principled conservative, a man of deep conviction and faith. And Senator. David Perdue has been one of the greatest allies of our administration in Washington, D. C. And another incredible leader, Kelly Leffler, 4th Generation, on her family's grain farm. She built her own company up from the ground. She broke barriers in business and sports to become one of Georgia's most successful business women. And I can tell you again, in a very short period of time, she has emerged as one of the most important conservative voices on capitol Hill. We need senator kelly Leffler back in Washington, D. C. So we support your senators because of who they are, but also because of everything that we've done with their support. I mean, think about it four years ago, we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise around the world and we witnessed a steadyault on our most cherished values. But with your two senators and under President Donald trump, we rebuilt our military, we revive our economy. We secured our border, stood with law enforcement and fought for life and liberty and the constitution of the United States of America. Yeah. And everything starts with our national defense. You know, I'm your vice president but highest title I'll ever hold is D A. D wow. Okay. And I'm the proud father of a United States Marine and the father in law of a navy pilot. And I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces. President trump has signed the largest investments in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. Mhm I mean the truth is we're finally given our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guard the support they need to defend this nation. And Senator David Perdue from his seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee has been there every step of the way. Thank you senator. So it's been about standing with those who served but also standing with all of you who did serve in the uniform of the United States. You know, the last administration saw years of scandal at the V. A. That shocked the conscience of the nation. Do you remember I mean, we literally had veterans in this country passing away, waiting for care at via hospitals in this country. But when President trump came into office With the help of your two senators, those days are over. President Trump signed the most sweeping reforms of the via in 50 years. We fired 10,000 via employees that weren't giving our veterans the care that they earned and veterans choices now available for every veteran in America. And from her seat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator kelly Leffler was there every step of the way And with our renewed american strength the last four years, we've stood up to our enemies and stood with our allies at the direction of Commander in chief. Our armed forces took down the last inch of territory under the black flag of ISIS eliminated their leader and Qasem Soleimani is gone. Yeah, we stood with those who threaten us. But we've stood with our most cherished ally. Like never before. After four different presidents made the promise and broke it. It was President donald trump who kept his promise and moved the american embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel. Oh, so it's been about security, standing strong in the world. It's also been about our prosperity. And again your senators have been there every step of the way. After the slowest recovery. In some 75 years, President trump revived the american economy. We cut taxes, we roll back regulation. We fought for free and fair trade unleashed American energy and in three short years businesses large and small created seven million good paying jobs, including 350,000 jobs right here in the Peach state. And your senators were there every step of the way, especially in this challenging year through which we passed. It's amazing to think in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. It was a moment in which we lost 22 million jobs. But because of the strong foundation that both of Georgia senators supported, We've already seen more than 12 million Americans go back to work. We're opening up America again. I mean the response to this pandemic, I must tell you, serving alongside this president, been deeply inspiring to me as an american. With the support of your two senators, we launched the greatest national mobilization since World War Two. We secured financial support for families and businesses. And while the other side said it would take a miracle to get a vaccine. Before the end of the year, we just heard the CDC in Atlanta, we're about a week and a half away from starting to distribute tens of millions of doses of a safe and effective vaccine. America is in the miracle business and David Perdue and kelly Leffler were there every day of this challenging year. But when it comes to the rule of law, I couldn't be more proud to report to you with the strong support of these senators. We've confirmed more than 220 Conservative judges to our federal courts at every level and they are all men and women who will uphold the God given liberties enshrined in our constitution, like the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And none of that would have been possible without the consistent support and vote of Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler. It was Georgia, senators who were there when we confirmed justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice. Amy coney Barrett. Yeah. In fact, Senator kelly Leffler was the first member of the United States Senate to call for the immediate confirmation of Justice Amy coney Barrett. And it couldn't be more important than it is right now. I think you all understand a strong judiciary is the vanguard of our liberties under the last administration. You remember how our values and our freedoms were under assault in the last administration actually was trampling on the religious liberty of americans on a regular basis. They compromise the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and of religious charities. They even called the little sisters of the poor into federal court to force them to compromise their faith to live under the mandates of Obamacare. In fact, we saw that religious intolerance two years ago when Amy coney Barrett went before the Judiciary Committee the first time the leading democrat on the committee actually said she was concerned because of Amy coney Barrett, sincere christian faith, she said. And I quote, the dogma lives loudly within you and Hollywood liberals have been ridicule and Amy coney barrett ever since. Well, I got news for the democrats in Washington and their friends in Hollywood, that dogma lives loudly in me, that dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the Constitution of the United States of America. So for our liberties, for our freedoms, we need Senator David Perdue and kelly Leffler back in a Republican majority in the United States Senate. Yeah, yeah. Near the stakes in this election has never been higher. The choice has never been clearer where David Perdue and kelly Leffler stand for a strong national defense, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are gonna cut in our national defense to fund their big government programs. Where David Perdue and kelly Leffler cut taxes, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock want to raise taxes on working families and businesses large and small. Mhm. Where David Perdue and kelly Leffler support our military. Raphael Warnock has demeaned our military and repeatedly defended the anti Semitic rhetoric of reverend Jeremiah wright, and where Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock support taxpayer funding of abortion. David Perdue and kelly Leffler stand for the right to life. Mhm. I mean, you all know what the stakes are here in Georgia, chuck, schumer said it couldn't have said it more clearly. He said, quote now we take Georgia then we change America. I got a message for chuck schumer and the Washington democrats. We're going to keep Georgia, We're going to save the senate and then we're gonna save America. You know, our agenda is american greatness. Their agenda is american decline, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock's agenda of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine. A green new deal defunding the police and packing the courts. It's wrong for Georgia and Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are wrong for Georgia and wrong for America. That's why we need Georgia to say no to us off and Warnock and yes to Senator David Perdue and Senator Kelly Leffler on January five. So George, I came here today to say stay in the fight, Stay in the fight for integrity in our elections. Mhm, and stay in the fight to defend the republican majority in the Senate. Stay in the fight until the polls close on January five and we sent David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to a Republican majority. I mean to keep America great everybody, that's what's on the line to preserve the progress that we've made to protect our values and our liberties. We need you to vote Georgia. We need you to vote to send Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler back to Washington, D. C. Yeah, it all starts now. They've got a few things to ask you to do before I get back on that airplane.

So between now and when the polls close on January five, we need you to vote George and we need you tell everybody to get it done. I know we've all got our doubts about the last election. And I actually hear some people saying, just don't vote my fellow americans. If you don't vote, they win. If you don't vote, there could be nothing to stop chuck schumer and nancy. Pelosi from cutting our military, raising taxes and passing the agenda of the radical left. Yeah. For all we've done for all we have yet to do for our president and our future for Georgia and America cast another vote for all that president trump has accomplished. Vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to the United States Senate. And I promise you we're going to keep on fighting and we know this. We can fight for our president and we can fight for more republicans in the Senate. At the same time, we have done both. We're going to keep doing both. We're gonna make America great again. The vote Georgia. Yeah. And after you vote I absentee or early voting or even on Election Day? Do what Ronald Mcdaniel. Just challenge you to do. Go tell somebody what the stakes are and tell them what's on the line here. Tell me about the progress that we've made over the last four years and all that we can continue to do to make this country safe and secure and strong and prosperous and free. I mean, here's the deal Georgia. It might all come down to you. Yeah. Are you with me? Go tell your neighbors and friends and worshipping at work. So I ran into mike out at the airport. David Perdue was there and Ronald Mcdaniel doug Collins. And these people are all fired up. But the key is We've got to bring it all together. Georgia's got to bring it. Georgia's got to hold the line on January five. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. And finally as you leave here today, I hope you tell people what we talked about, share the same passion you shared with all of us. Tell them what the stakes are telling the difference that one vote can make here in the state of Georgia and have faith. You know we may not know what the future holds but we know who holds the future. Yeah. So finally in these challenging times in the life of our nation, I'd encourage you to avail yourself of that wellspring of strength from which the people of this state and this nation have drawn throughout our history and when you do so remember that ancient promise that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn that he'll do like he's always done throughout the long and storied history of this state and this nation, he'll hear from heaven and he'll he'll this lamp, this one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America. It'll make a difference.

You know, I'm here on the president's behalf because we need Georgia to send these two great senators back to Washington, D. C. We need to send them back for three reasons. We need to send them back because of who they are. We need to send him back because of all we've accomplished together and we need to send them back because the republican majority could be the last line of defense to preserve all we've done to defend this nation, revive our economy and preserve the God. Given liberties we hold dear. We need to hold the line Georgia. Yeah. Mhm. But first off, I'm here, just like governor produced that. I'm here and he didn't even my cousin. I'm here because of, of who these people are. David Perdue is a son of making. He worked his way to the top of the business world. Could have spent the rest of his life in leisure. But as you heard his cousin say, he and his family went to their knees and they felt a calling to serve After 40 years is one of the most successful business leaders in America. He answered the call to serve Georgia in the United States Senate. And I can tell you having served alongside of this good man every day I know of no more principled conservative man of integrity or champion of president trump's agenda in the United States Senate, then Senator David Perdue. We need him back. And I'm also here because of his colleague in the Senate. Fourth generation family farmer grew up in the Heartland of America, but got here to Georgia just has ever been as quick as she could build our own company from the ground up. You know her story, she broke barriers in business and sports, become one of the most successful business women in Georgia history and in a very short period of time, I can tell you she has emerged as one of the most courageous and principled conservative voices in the United States Senate. We need senator kelly Leffler back in Washington, D. C. Okay. Really? So president trump And I need you to sport these senators to get your family and your neighbors and your friends to do the same because of who they are. But it's also because of all that we've been able to do with their support. Let me think about it. Four years ago, we inherited a military. They've been hollowed out by reckless budget cuts, an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise. And we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values with the unwavering support of both of Georgia's senator under the leadership of President Donald trump, we rebuilt our military, we revive our economy. We secured our border, stood with law enforcement and fought for life and liberty and the constitution of the United states of America. Mhm That's true. You know I have to tell you a lot of you know me as your vice president by the highest title I'll ever hold his D. A. D. And I couldn't be more proud to be the father and the father in law of two military fighter pilots and I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces. With the support of your senators. President Donald trump has signed the largest increases in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. Yeah. Were finally given our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guard the support they need to defend this nation. And I can tell you from his seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senator David Perdue has been there for our military every step of the way. Thank you senator. And it's not just been about those who serve today but it's also about those of you who did serve in the uniform of the United States. You remember the last administration? We saw years of scandal at the viva that shocked the conscience of the nation. But when President Donald trump came into office With the help of your two senators those days were over, President trump signed the most sweeping reforms of the V. A. In 50 years. We fired 5000 V. A. Employees that weren't given our veterans the care that you earned and veterans choices now available for every veteran in America. Yeah. And from her seat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, senator kelly Leffler was there for America's veterans every step of the way. Yeah. Yeah. And with that renewed american strength, rebuilding our military, restoring the arsenal democracy. We took the fight to our enemies on our terms on their soil and we've stood with our allies as never before at the direction of this commander in chief, The armed forces, the United States took down the last inch of territory under the black flag of ISIS and took out their leader without one American casualties. And when the most dangerous terrorists in the world, a man responsible for the death of hundreds of american service members was in our sights. President Donald trump took him out. Qasem Soleimani is gone. Mhm. So we've stood up to our enemies but we've also stood with our most cherished ally as never before. You know, four presidents in a row had made the promise to the american people. But it was President Donald twho kept his promise when we moved the american embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel. Yeah. And Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler were there every step of the way. So it's been about America's place in the world, our national security, but it's also been about our prosperity. These last four years After the slowest recovery in 75 years, president tworked with your senators and we revived our economy. We cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small. We rolled back more federal regulation than any administration in history. We fought for free and fair trade unleashed american energy. And in three short years We saw seven million good paying jobs created including 350,000 right here in the state of Georgia. And your senators were there every step of the way. Yeah. And as we made our way this year through one of the most challenging years in our lifetime on that solid foundation that we poured of less taxes, less regulation of growing american economy At the height of the coronavirus pandemic. We've lost 22 million jobs With the strong support of your two senators. With the relief efforts that president trump secured from Congress. We've been opening up America again. We've already seen 12 million Americans go back to work. The American comeback is happening. And speaking of that pandemic, I I have to tell you how grateful we are. Senator produced senator Leffler for their support all along the way. At president trump's direction. Early this year we launched the greatest national mobilization since world war two. We reinvented testing. We saw that the delivery of billions of medical supplies to our doctors and nurses and hospitals. We managed to distribute hundreds of thousands of medicines and therapeutics. And as I stand here today, while the other side said it would never happen, it would take a miracle. We're just a few days away from the approval of the first coronavirus vaccine for the american people and millions of doses America is in the miracle business under President Donald trump. Yeah. And again, your senators were there every step of the way and frankly, when it comes to the foundation of our prosperity and the rule of law, I couldn't be more grateful with the support of Senator Perdue and Senator left President Trump and I have seen more than 220 Conservative judges confirmed to our federal courts at every level, including justice, Neil, Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice Amy Coney Barrett. And I'll tell you those three justices and all those judges are all men and women who will uphold all the God given liberties enshrined in our constitution, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. You want the last administration, you'll remember it. We we saw a steady assault on our values and our freedom especially trampled on the religious liberty of americans. You remember, I mean, literally the last administration used the power of the federal government to compromise the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and religious charities. They even hauled a group of nuns known as the little Sisters of the poor, into federal court to order them to compromise their faith to live under the mandates of Obamacare. And they're promising to do it again, aren't they send Mhm. But we saw religious intolerance among the democrats alike to which we would see again if they got control of the Senate. I mean, you all remember a couple years ago when Amy coney Barrett was was up for another judgeship. She was before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the leading democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee actually told Amy coney Barrett that she was concerned about her sincere catholic faith, she said. And I quote, the dogma lives loudly within you and Hollywood liberals have been attacking Amy coney Barrett ever since for her faith and for values. Well, I got news for the democrats in Washington and their friends in Hollywood. No, that dogma lives loudly in me. That dogma lives loudly in year. Yeah. In the right to live and worship according to the dictates of our faith. Lives loudly in the constitution of the United States of America. So for our liberties for our freedoms, for the ability to live and to work and to worship according to the dictates of our conscience. We need a Republican majority in the United States Senate, we need David Perdue and kelly Leffler back in Washington, D. C. I don't have to tell all of you have come out on this sunny day. The stakes in this election has never been higher. The choice in this election has never been clear. I mean, I'm here because of who they are. I'm here because of all we've done, but I'm here because this choice is so stark. Where David Perdue and kelly Leffler stand for a strong national defense, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are gonna cut our national defense to fund their big government programs. You just watch where David Perdue and kelly Leffler cut taxes, Jon Ossoff and the radical liberal Raphael Warnock want to raise taxes on working families and businesses large and small, and where David Perdue and kelly Leffler support our military. Raphael Warnock has demeaned our military and he's repeatedly defended the anti Semitic rhetoric of reverend Jeremiah wright and maybe most close to my heart where Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock support abortion on demand and taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. David Perdue and kelly Leffler will always stand for the right to life. Thank you. You all know what the stakes are here in Georgia. I mean, chuck schumer couldn't have said it better, right, chuck, schumer said, quote, now we take Georgia, then we change America. Well, I got another message for chuck schumer in the Washington democrat, we're gonna keep Georgia, we're going to save the senate and then we're going to save America. Yeah, yeah. I mean for real our agenda is american greatness. Their agenda is american decline. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock advance a socialist agenda of higher taxes, open borders government, takeover of health care. A green new deal defunding the police packing the courts. And that's just for starters, right, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are wrong for Georgia and wrong for America. That's why we need Georgia to say no to sf and Warnock and yes to Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler on january 5th. But I came here today to say from my heart, but you heard the president say the other night in Valdosta that I need you to say to all of your neighbors and friends in these challenging times in the life of our nation. Georgia. Stay in the fight. Stay in the fight for integrity in our elections. Stay in the fight to defend the republican majority in the Senate and stay in the fight until the polls close on january 5th and we send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to Washington D. C. Yeah. Stay in the fight to keep America. Great. That's what's on the line to preserve the progress that we've made, protect our values and our liberties. We need to do a couple of things, folks. First off we need you to vote Georgia vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to the United States Senate. I'm talking basics now, man, I'm told you can actually request an absentee ballot today. If you need information, you go to Georgia voting info dot com. They've got everything you need. You have until December 31 the request an absentee ballot and I want you to be confident about your vote.

Bring a family member, bring a neighbor, bring a friend and vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to Washington, D. C. I know we all got doubts about this last election. I know I do, but I actually hear some people saying here in the peach state just don't vote. Yeah. My fellow americans. If you don't vote, they win. If you don't vote, there could be nothing to stop chuck schumer and nancy. Pelosi from cutting our military raising taxes and passing their agenda. The radical left. So I want to say to you from my heart for all we've done for all we have yet to do for our president, for our future for Georgia. And for America, cast another vote for all president trump has accomplished. Cast a vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to the United States Senate. And I promise you we're going to keep on fighting. You know, we can we can fight for our president and fight for more republicans in the Senate. At the same time we've done both. We're gonna keep doing both. We're gonna keep fighting to make America great again. So here's the deal. Here's the deal. Georgia. It might all come down to you. And Georgia has got to hold the line on January five. Will you do it? Oh right. Mhm. Hold my hold mm. All right. Oh I'll tell you, I have no doubt you will. I really do. But I want to challenge you right after you vote Either absentee or early in person or come January five. Whenever you cast that vote just spend every other minute that you have reaching out to your neighbors and friends. Tell him I was out at the airport in Augusta the other day. I ran into mike, president was down at bell boston. These guys just keep coming back to Georgia. You gotta tell people this, re electing these two great senators isn't just about Georgia. It's about America. Go tell your neighbors and friends it's on the line. Yeah. Tell them everything we talked about today. Everything that we've done, everything we have yet to do. I mean it's a it all comes down to the peach state but I leave here today with renewed confidence. I gotta tell you seeing this big crowd out today. I got a feeling we're gonna bank a big win comes from January five. How about you? I mean, we live in uncertain times, don't we? In my house? You know, we have a saying, we don't know what the future holds, but we know who holds the future. Mhm. So as we work to stand with our president, protect the integrity of our elections as we work. Save the majority in the United States Senate, I'd encourage you if you ever mind to do one more thing. If from time to time you bow the head and bend the knee, I'd encourage you to do that too. Be a good time to pray for Georgia and pray for America. And in these divided times, I'd encourage you to pray with confidence, claim that ancient promise that americans have clung to and much more challenging times than we could even imagine that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn, he'll do like he's always done in the long and storied history of this state and nation. He'll hear from heaven and heal heal this land, this one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America and pray for all of those standing in the gap for everything we hold dear. Yeah, but I want to thank you for coming out today and I just know, I just know if all of us do all that we need to do Between now and January five, I know if Georgia vote your values and your convictions. If you vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to a Republican majority in the United States Senate. If you keep standing with this president until every legal vote is counting that with the support of people all across the state and with God's help right? We're going to keep on winning. We're going to defend the Senate. We're going to keep making America great again. We will win Georgia and save America. Now let's go get it done. Georgia. 	Well hello Georgia. My friend Senator David Perdue. two former governor. Sonny Perdue congressman rick Allen, congressman William timmons. The great state Party chair for the GOP. David Shafer. My fellow americans. It is great to be back in the peace States. The fight is on. Mhm. And you know it's great to be here with so many friends and speaking of friends of mine allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine and a man who has been fighting every day to keep the promises that he made to the people of Georgia. I bring greetings and thanks from the 45th president of the United States of America. President Donald Trump. Yeah, yeah. You know, with the support of people all across George and all across this country, it's amazing. This president And our team received more than 74 million votes across America 10 million more votes than four years ago. Oh, We received the greatest share of minority votes of any Republican candidate for president in 60 years. And we added more than a dozen seats already to the United States Congress. And we're gonna put two more in the winning column. When we send Georgia's senators back to Washington, D. C. You know, I'm here because I stand with President Donald trump and we stand with Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler and together With your two great senators. We're fighting every day for integrity in our elections and we're fighting every day to hold the line and save the majority in the United States Senate. Yeah, it's really why I'm here. That's why the president was in Valdosta on saturday. And that's why I'm so grateful that you all came out to this gathering in Augusta today. I don't know if you heard about it so far. Just in the last few days, 18 states have joined the Lone Star State to defend the integrity of our elections before the highest court in the land. Mhm. President Donald trump deserves his day in court. The Supreme Court. And all I can say is God bless texas for men and women of George. I'll tell you is our election contests continue here in Georgia and in states across the country. I'll make you promise we're going to keep fighting until every legal vote is counted. We're going to keep fighting until every illegal vote is thrown out. And we will never stop fighting to make America great again. That's why president trump. And I need David Perdue and kelly Leffler back in a Republican majority in the United States Senate. Yeah. You know, for all we've done for all we have yet to do. We need the peach state to defend the majority because the road to a Senate majority runs right through the state of Georgia. Are you with me? You know, I'm here on the president's behalf because we need Georgia to send these two great senators back to Washington, D. C. We need to send them back for three reasons. We need to send them back because of who they are. We need to send him back because of all we've accomplished together and we need to send them back because the republican majority could be the last line of defense to preserve all we've done to defend this nation, revive our economy and preserve the God. Given liberties we hold dear. We need to hold the line Georgia. Yeah. Mhm. But first off, I'm here, just like governor produced that. I'm here and he didn't even my cousin. I'm here because of, of who these people are. David Perdue is a son of making. He worked his way to the top of the business world. Could have spent the rest of his life in leisure. But as you heard his cousin say, he and his family went to their knees and they felt a calling to serve After 40 years is one of the most successful business leaders in America. He answered the call to serve Georgia in the United States Senate. And I can tell you having served alongside of this good man every day I know of no more principled conservative man of integrity or champion of president trump's agenda in the United States Senate, then Senator David Perdue. We need him back. And I'm also here because of his colleague in the Senate. Fourth generation family farmer grew up in the Heartland of America, but got here to Georgia just has ever been as quick as she could build our own company from the ground up. You know her story, she broke barriers in business and sports, become one of the most successful business women in Georgia history and in a very short period of time, I can tell you she has emerged as one of the most courageous and principled conservative voices in the United States Senate. We need senator kelly Leffler back in Washington, D. C. Okay. Really? So president trump And I need you to sport these senators to get your family and your neighbors and your friends to do the same because of who they are. But it's also because of all that we've been able to do with their support. Let me think about it. Four years ago, we inherited a military. They've been hollowed out by reckless budget cuts, an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise. And we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values with the unwavering support of both of Georgia's senator under the leadership of President Donald trump, we rebuilt our military, we revive our economy. We secured our border, stood with law enforcement and fought for life and liberty and the constitution of the United states of America. Mhm That's true. You know I have to tell you a lot of you know me as your vice president by the highest title I'll ever hold his D. A. D. And I couldn't be more proud to be the father and the father in law of two military fighter pilots and I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces. With the support of your senators. President Donald trump has signed the largest increases in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. Yeah. Were finally given our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guard the support they need to defend this nation. And I can tell you from his seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senator David Perdue has been there for our military every step of the way. Thank you senator. And it's not just been about those who serve today but it's also about those of you who did serve in the uniform of the United States. You remember the last administration? We saw years of scandal at the viva that shocked the conscience of the nation. But when President Donald trump came into office With the help of your two senators those days were over, President trump signed the most sweeping reforms of the V. A. In 50 years. We fired 5000 V. A. Employees that weren't given our veterans the care that you earned and veterans choices now available for every veteran in America. Yeah. And from her seat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, senator kelly Leffler was there for America's veterans every step of the way. Yeah. Yeah. And with that renewed american strength, rebuilding our military, restoring the arsenal democracy. We took the fight to our enemies on our terms on their soil and we've stood with our allies as never before at the direction of this commander in chief, The armed forces, the United States took down the last inch of territory under the black flag of ISIS and took out their leader without one American casualties. And when the most dangerous terrorists in the world, a man responsible for the death of hundreds of american service members was in our sights. President Donald trump took him out. Qasem Soleimani is gone. Mhm. So we've stood up to our enemies but we've also stood with our most cherished ally as never before. You know, four presidents in a row had made the promise to the american people. But it was President Donald twho kept his promise when we moved the american embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel. Yeah. And Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler were there every step of the way. So it's been about America's place in the world, our national security, but it's also been about our prosperity. These last four years After the slowest recovery in 75 years, president tworked with your senators and we revived our economy. We cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small. We rolled back more federal regulation than any administration in history. We fought for free and fair trade unleashed american energy. And in three short years We saw seven million good paying jobs created including 350,000 right here in the state of Georgia. And your senators were there every step of the way. Yeah. And as we made our way this year through one of the most challenging years in our lifetime on that solid foundation that we poured of less taxes, less regulation of growing american economy At the height of the coronavirus pandemic. We've lost 22 million jobs With the strong support of your two senators. With the relief efforts that president trump secured from Congress. We've been opening up America again. We've already seen 12 million Americans go back to work. The American comeback is happening. And speaking of that pandemic, I I have to tell you how grateful we are. Senator produced senator Leffler for their support all along the way. At president trump's direction. Early this year we launched the greatest national mobilization since world war two. We reinvented testing. We saw that the delivery of billions of medical supplies to our doctors and nurses and hospitals. We managed to distribute hundreds of thousands of medicines and therapeutics. And as I stand here today, while the other side said it would never happen, it would take a miracle. We're just a few days away from the approval of the first coronavirus vaccine for the american people and millions of doses America is in the miracle business under President Donald trump. Yeah. And again, your senators were there every step of the way and frankly, when it comes to the foundation of our prosperity and the rule of law, I couldn't be more grateful with the support of Senator Perdue and Senator left President Trump and I have seen more than 220 Conservative judges confirmed to our federal courts at every level, including justice, Neil, Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice Amy Coney Barrett. And I'll tell you those three justices and all those judges are all men and women who will uphold all the God given liberties enshrined in our constitution, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. You want the last administration, you'll remember it. We we saw a steady assault on our values and our freedom especially trampled on the religious liberty of americans. You remember, I mean, literally the last administration used the power of the federal government to compromise the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and religious charities. They even hauled a group of nuns known as the little Sisters of the poor, into federal court to order them to compromise their faith to live under the mandates of Obamacare. And they're promising to do it again, aren't they send Mhm. But we saw religious intolerance among the democrats alike to which we would see again if they got control of the Senate. I mean, you all remember a couple years ago when Amy coney Barrett was was up for another judgeship. She was before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the leading democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee actually told Amy coney Barrett that she was concerned about her sincere catholic faith, she said. And I quote, the dogma lives loudly within you and Hollywood liberals have been attacking Amy coney Barrett ever since for her faith and for values. Well, I got news for the democrats in Washington and their friends in Hollywood. No, that dogma lives loudly in me. That dogma lives loudly in year. Yeah. In the right to live and worship according to the dictates of our faith. Lives loudly in the constitution of the United States of America. So for our liberties for our freedoms, for the ability to live and to work and to worship according to the dictates of our conscience. We need a Republican majority in the United States Senate, we need David Perdue and kelly Leffler back in Washington, D. C. I don't have to tell all of you have come out on this sunny day. The stakes in this election has never been higher. The choice in this election has never been clear. I mean, I'm here because of who they are. I'm here because of all we've done, but I'm here because this choice is so stark. Where David Perdue and kelly Leffler stand for a strong national defense, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are gonna cut our national defense to fund their big government programs. You just watch where David Perdue and kelly Leffler cut taxes, Jon Ossoff and the radical liberal Raphael Warnock want to raise taxes on working families and businesses large and small, and where David Perdue and kelly Leffler support our military. Raphael Warnock has demeaned our military and he's repeatedly defended the anti Semitic rhetoric of reverend Jeremiah wright and maybe most close to my heart where Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock support abortion on demand and taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. David Perdue and kelly Leffler will always stand for the right to life. Thank you. You all know what the stakes are here in Georgia. I mean, chuck schumer couldn't have said it better, right, chuck, schumer said, quote, now we take Georgia, then we change America. Well, I got another message for chuck schumer in the Washington democrat, we're gonna keep Georgia, we're going to save the senate and then we're going to save America. Yeah, yeah. I mean for real our agenda is american greatness. Their agenda is american decline. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock advance a socialist agenda of higher taxes, open borders government, takeover of health care. A green new deal defunding the police packing the courts. And that's just for starters, right, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are wrong for Georgia and wrong for America. That's why we need Georgia to say no to sf and Warnock and yes to Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler on january 5th. But I came here today to say from my heart, but you heard the president say the other night in Valdosta that I need you to say to all of your neighbors and friends in these challenging times in the life of our nation. Georgia. Stay in the fight. Stay in the fight for integrity in our elections. Stay in the fight to defend the republican majority in the Senate and stay in the fight until the polls close on january 5th and we send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to Washington D. C. Yeah. Stay in the fight to keep America. Great. That's what's on the line to preserve the progress that we've made, protect our values and our liberties. We need to do a couple of things, folks. First off we need you to vote Georgia vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to the United States Senate. I'm talking basics now, man, I'm told you can actually request an absentee ballot today. If you need information, you go to Georgia voting info dot com. They've got everything you need.

Bring a family member, bring a neighbor, bring a friend and vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to Washington, D. C. I know we all got doubts about this last election. I know I do, but I actually hear some people saying here in the peach state just don't vote. Yeah. My fellow americans. If you don't vote, they win. If you don't vote, there could be nothing to stop chuck schumer and nancy. Pelosi from cutting our military raising taxes and passing their agenda. The radical left. So I want to say to you from my heart for all we've done for all we have yet to do for our president, for our future for Georgia. And for America, cast another vote for all president trump has accomplished. Cast a vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to the United States Senate. And I promise you we're going to keep on fighting. You know, we can we can fight for our president and fight for more republicans in the Senate. At the same time we've done both. We're gonna keep doing both. We're gonna keep fighting to make America great again. So here's the deal. Here's the deal. Georgia. It might all come down to you. And Georgia has got to hold the line on January five. Will you do it? Oh right. Mhm. Hold my hold mm. All right. Oh I'll tell you, I have no doubt you will. I really do. But I want to challenge you right after you vote Either absentee or early in person or come January five. Whenever you cast that vote just spend every other minute that you have reaching out to your neighbors and friends. Tell him I was out at the airport in Augusta the other day. I ran into mike, president was down at bell boston. These guys just keep coming back to Georgia. You gotta tell people this, re electing these two great senators isn't just about Georgia. It's about America. Go tell your neighbors and friends it's on the line. Yeah. Tell them everything we talked about today. Everything that we've done, everything we have yet to do. I mean it's a it all comes down to the peach state but I leave here today with renewed confidence. I gotta tell you seeing this big crowd out today. I got a feeling we're gonna bank a big win comes from January five. How about you? I mean, we live in uncertain times, don't we? In my house? You know, we have a saying, we don't know what the future holds, but we know who holds the future. Mhm. So as we work to stand with our president, protect the integrity of our elections as we work. Save the majority in the United States Senate, I'd encourage you if you ever mind to do one more thing. If from time to time you bow the head and bend the knee, I'd encourage you to do that too. Be a good time to pray for Georgia and pray for America. And in these divided times, I'd encourage you to pray with confidence, claim that ancient promise that americans have clung to and much more challenging times than we could even imagine that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn, he'll do like he's always done in the long and storied history of this state and nation. He'll hear from heaven and heal heal this land, this one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America and pray for all of those standing in the gap for everything we hold dear. Yeah, but I want to thank you for coming out today and I just know, I just know if all of us do all that we need to do Between now and January five, I know if Georgia vote your values and your convictions. If you vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to a Republican majority in the United States Senate.

Senator David produced senator kelly Leffler, former governor, Sonny Perdue congressman, Mark walker, Congressman elect Byron, Donald's state senators, Bert jones and Tyler harper. All my fellow americans. It is great to be back in the heart of Georgia and good to be here with so many friends before me and behind me, speaking of friends of mine, allow me to be greetings from another friend of mine, A man who loves the state of Georgia and who will never stop fighting to keep the promises that he made to the people of the Peach state. I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America. President Donald trump. It's amazing to think about with the support of all of you. President Trump received more than 74 million votes across America. 10 million. More than 2016. The greatest share of minority votes Of a Republican president in 60 years. And we added 12 seats to the United States Congress and as our election contests continue here in Georgia and in states across the country, I'll make your promise we're going to keep fighting until every legal vote is counted. We're going to keep fighting until every illegal vote is thrown out and we will never stop fighting to make America great again. I'm here because I stand with President Donald trump and I'm here because we stand with Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler Together, we're fighting for free and fair elections. And together we're fighting to hold the line in the United States Senate. We're fighting to win Georgia and save America for all we've done for all we have yet to do president trump. And I need David Perdue and kelly Leffler back in a Republican majority in the United States Senate. Are you with me? We need Georgia to send these two great senators back to a majority in Washington because of who they are, because of all we've accomplished together. And because the Republican Senate majority could be the last line of defense to preserve all we've done to defend this nation, revive our economy, preserve the God given liberties that we hold dear. That's why we need a A 4th Generation family farmer build our own company from the ground up broke barriers in business in sports become one of the most successful business women in Georgia. And in a short period of time, I can tell you, she's already emerged as one of the most courageous conservative voices on capitol hill. We need senator kelly Loeffler back in Washington, D. C. That's also why we need a son of making who worked his way to the top of the business world. He spent 40 years as one of the most successful business leaders in America through prayer and reflection. He and his family felt the call to serve. They stepped up to serve the great state of Georgia. And I can tell you having seen him when the cameras are off, President trump and our administration have no greater champion of the mega agenda in Washington D. C. Than Senator David Perdue. So president trump and I need you to support your senator's reelection because of who they are, but also support them because of everything that we've been able to do together for the state of Georgia and for America. Let me think about it. Four years ago we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by reckless budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the worst recovery since the great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values. But with the strong and steady support of your two senators under president donald trump, we rebuild our military. We revived our economy. We secured our border, stood with law enforcement and fought for life and liberty and the constitution of the United States of America. You know, I'm your vice president. But the highest title I'll ever hold is D. A. D. Couldn't be I couldn't be more grateful as vice president, but also as the father of the United States Marine and father in law of a navy pilot to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about our armed forces and with the strong support. Senator David Perdue on the Armed services Committee. We've signed the largest increases in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan were given our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guard the support they need to defend our nation. Thank you Senator. Yeah. You know the last administration also saw years of scandal at the V. A. Remember shocked the conscience of the nation when president trump came into office with the help of your two senators. Those days are over from her seat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator kelly Leffler was there Supporting our veterans every step of the way we signed the most sweeping reforms. In 50 years we fired 5000 via employees that weren't given our veterans the care they deserve and veterans choice is now available for every veteran in America. Thank you senator Laffer. and after the slowest recovery in 75 years, president trump revived our economy with the support of Georgia, Senators, we cut taxes across the board. We rolled back regulations at a record level. We fought for free and fair trade unleashed american energy And in three short years We saw American businesses create seven million good paying jobs including 350,000 jobs right here in the Peach state. And your senators were there every step of the way It was a blue collar boom in those 1st 3 years in Georgia and all across America. And then the coronavirus pandemic struck from china with the support of these leaders and the leadership of our president, we launched the largest national mobilization since World war two. We reinvented testing. We saw the delivery of billions of medical supplies. We secured trillions of dollars in support for families and businesses to make their way through this difficult time. And we've developed new medicines that are saving lives every day. It's amazing to think at the height of this pandemic, we lost 22 million American jobs. But because of the strong foundation that we poured with this president and Georgia's senators, We've already seen 12 million Americans go back to work, we're opening up America again, maybe most of all in this season of hope. While the other side said it couldn't be done by the end of the year. This week, the american people witnessed promises made and promises kept under operation warp speed. We made history this week with the first coronavirus vaccine for the american people and it's being administered all across the country and David Perdue and kelly Lefler were there every step of the way throughout this challenging year. And we couldn't be more great. And finally, when it comes to the rule of law and our most cherished liberties. I couldn't be more proud to report to you that with their support in this president's leadership. We've already seen more than 220 conservatives appointed to our federal courts at every level and they are all principled men and women who will uphold the God given liberties in our constitution like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and remember the president nominates to the federal courts but it's the senators that confirm so none of that would have been possible without the strong and consistent support of Senator David Perdue and senator kelly left. In fact Georgia senators were there when we confirmed three justices to the Supreme Court including justice Neil Gorsuch, justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice. Amy coney Barrett get onto the last administration. You all remember our values and our freedoms were under steady assault. The last administration trampled on the religious liberty of americans on a regular basis compromise the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and religious charity. They even hauled a group of nuns known as the little sisters of the poor into federal court to order them to compromise their faith to live under the standards of Obamacare. And we saw that religious intolerance among democrats. Just a couple of years ago when Amy coney Barrett was going before the Judiciary Committee. You remember the democrat leader of that committee actually said she was concerned about Amy coney Barrett's christian faith because she said quote the dogma lives loudly within you and Hollywood liberals have been attacking Amy coney Barrett ever since. Well I got a message for the democrats in Washington D. C. And their friends in Hollywood that dogma lives loudly in me, that dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and worship according to the dictates of our faith. Lives loudly in the constitution of the United States of America. So for our liberties, for our freedoms, we need Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Lefler back in the United States Senate, you know, I think you all know especially the hardy bunch gathered out here today. The stakes in this election never been higher. It's choice has never been clear where David Perdue and kelly Leffler stands for a strong national defense, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are going to cut our national defense to fund their big government programs. You just watch where David Perdue and kelly Lefler cut taxes, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock want to raise taxes on working families and businesses all across the state of Georgia. In fact, Rafael Warnock was caught on tape saying that members of the Senate were Gangsters and thugs just for just for passing a tax cut for the people of Georgia and where David Perdue and kelly left her support our military and our most cherished ally radical liberal. Raphael Warnock has demeaned our military and repeatedly defended the anti Semitic rhetoric of reverend Jeremiah wright. In fact Rafael Warnock called our most cherished ally Israel an apartheid state. But with the strong support of kelly Lefler and David Perdue America stands with Israel and President trump moved the american embassy to Jerusalem the capital. And we're Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock support abortion on demand and support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. David Perdue. And kelly Leffler stand for the right to life. You all know what the stakes are, our liberties, our most cherished values, our prosperity, our security. But chuck schumer. Probably put it best. He said the other day, he said, quote now we take Georgia then we change America. Well, I got news for chuck schumer and the Washington democrats, We're gonna keep George, we're gonna save the Senate and then we're gonna save America. You know, I saw joe biden was in Atlanta this week. He gave a little speech, but he said in that speech, did you hear some of it? He said in that speech that Georgia doesn't need two senators that are quote, just going to get in the way. Well, Georgia, that's exactly what we need in the United States Senate. We need Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler to get in the way of their radical left agenda. We need David Perdue and kelly Leffler to get in the way of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and a Green new deal. We need two senators that will get in the way of the radical agenda of the Democratic Party and fight for Georgia every single day we need people across this state To say no to Ossoff and Warnock and Yes to David Perdue and Kelly Leffler on January five. So I came here today to say stay in the fight. And I don't think I need to tell this bunch that coming out on a cold and blustery day, give yourselves a round of applause dog now, really honored you here to stay in the fight.

Stay in the fight to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to Washington, D. C. We need them there to keep America great. That really is what's on the line to preserve the progress we've made to protect our values and our liberties. We need you to vote Georgia, vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to the United States Senate. That's it. That's our that's that's that's what it's gonna take. And I can tell from the determination on all of your faces that, you know, it's you know what it's going to take from each one. But I want to encourage you to get out and exercise that vote, do it as soon as you can, you can actually request an absentee ballot today. If you need information, go to Georgia voting info dot com. They'll give you everything you need you can request it Till December 31 and I want you to be confident about your vote.

So for all we've done and for all we have yet to do for our president, for our future for Georgia and for America cast another vote for all that president trump has accomplished. Cast a vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to the United States Senate. And I promise you, we'll keep fighting every day.

We've been doing both or we're going to keep doing both and we're never going to stop fighting to make America great again. That's my problem. Here's the deal. Here's the deal folks. It's about the usa, about everything we hold dear. Here's the deal Georgia. It might all come down to you. We need Georgia to hold the line on january five. Are you up for it? You're gonna do it.

I want you to make sure your family members and your neighbors and your friends know just how important this election is. The eyes of America are on Georgia, people who share our values and our ideals are looking to the people of Georgia to hold the line and I believe with all my heart that you will. And lastly I just as you prepare to vote to speak out, do all you can to send these two great senators back to Washington D. C. If you're inclined to do one more thing, I'd encourage you to do it. You're from time to time. You bow the head and bend the knee. I'd encourage you to do that too.

Let's let's go to that wellspring of strength that is always seeing the american people and the people of this straight through much more challenging. It's a good time to remember to pray and when you pray pray with the confidence of those ancient words that if his people who are called by his name, will humble themselves and pray and turn you can be confident. But he'll do like he's always done in the long and storied history of this country. He'll hear from heaven and heal heal this land, this one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America pray for all the people of America and I just know if all of us do all that we need to do all across this great state, all across this country.

We're going to defend the center. We're gonna win Georgia, we're going to save America and we're gonna keep making America great again. So let's go get it done.	Thank you all for coming out on this blustery december day. Senator David produced senator kelly Leffler, former governor, Sonny Perdue congressman, Mark walker, Congressman elect Byron, Donald's state senators, Bert jones and Tyler harper. All my fellow americans. It is great to be back in the heart of Georgia and good to be here with so many friends before me and behind me, speaking of friends of mine, allow me to be greetings from another friend of mine, A man who loves the state of Georgia and who will never stop fighting to keep the promises that he made to the people of the Peach state. I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America. President Donald trump. It's amazing to think about with the support of all of you. President Trump received more than 74 million votes across America. 10 million. More than 2016. The greatest share of minority votes Of a Republican president in 60 years. And we added 12 seats to the United States Congress and as our election contests continue here in Georgia and in states across the country, I'll make your promise we're going to keep fighting until every legal vote is counted. We're going to keep fighting until every illegal vote is thrown out and we will never stop fighting to make America great again. I'm here because I stand with President Donald trump and I'm here because we stand with Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler Together, we're fighting for free and fair elections. And together we're fighting to hold the line in the United States Senate. We're fighting to win Georgia and save America for all we've done for all we have yet to do president trump. And I need David Perdue and kelly Leffler back in a Republican majority in the United States Senate. Are you with me? We need Georgia to send these two great senators back to a majority in Washington because of who they are, because of all we've accomplished together. And because the Republican Senate majority could be the last line of defense to preserve all we've done to defend this nation, revive our economy, preserve the God given liberties that we hold dear. That's why we need a A 4th Generation family farmer build our own company from the ground up broke barriers in business in sports become one of the most successful business women in Georgia. And in a short period of time, I can tell you, she's already emerged as one of the most courageous conservative voices on capitol hill. We need senator kelly Loeffler back in Washington, D. C. That's also why we need a son of making who worked his way to the top of the business world. He spent 40 years as one of the most successful business leaders in America through prayer and reflection. He and his family felt the call to serve. They stepped up to serve the great state of Georgia. And I can tell you having seen him when the cameras are off, President trump and our administration have no greater champion of the mega agenda in Washington D. C. Than Senator David Perdue. So president trump and I need you to support your senator's reelection because of who they are, but also support them because of everything that we've been able to do together for the state of Georgia and for America. Let me think about it. Four years ago we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by reckless budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the worst recovery since the great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values. But with the strong and steady support of your two senators under president donald trump, we rebuild our military. We revived our economy. We secured our border, stood with law enforcement and fought for life and liberty and the constitution of the United States of America. You know, I'm your vice president. But the highest title I'll ever hold is D. A. D. Couldn't be I couldn't be more grateful as vice president, but also as the father of the United States Marine and father in law of a navy pilot to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about our armed forces and with the strong support. Senator David Perdue on the Armed services Committee. We've signed the largest increases in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan were given our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guard the support they need to defend our nation. Thank you Senator. Yeah. You know the last administration also saw years of scandal at the V. A. Remember shocked the conscience of the nation when president trump came into office with the help of your two senators. Those days are over from her seat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator kelly Leffler was there Supporting our veterans every step of the way we signed the most sweeping reforms. In 50 years we fired 5000 via employees that weren't given our veterans the care they deserve and veterans choice is now available for every veteran in America. Thank you senator Laffer. and after the slowest recovery in 75 years, president trump revived our economy with the support of Georgia, Senators, we cut taxes across the board. We rolled back regulations at a record level. We fought for free and fair trade unleashed american energy And in three short years We saw American businesses create seven million good paying jobs including 350,000 jobs right here in the Peach state. And your senators were there every step of the way It was a blue collar boom in those 1st 3 years in Georgia and all across America. And then the coronavirus pandemic struck from china with the support of these leaders and the leadership of our president, we launched the largest national mobilization since World war two. We reinvented testing. We saw the delivery of billions of medical supplies. We secured trillions of dollars in support for families and businesses to make their way through this difficult time. And we've developed new medicines that are saving lives every day. It's amazing to think at the height of this pandemic, we lost 22 million American jobs. But because of the strong foundation that we poured with this president and Georgia's senators, We've already seen 12 million Americans go back to work, we're opening up America again, maybe most of all in this season of hope. While the other side said it couldn't be done by the end of the year. This week, the american people witnessed promises made and promises kept under operation warp speed. We made history this week with the first coronavirus vaccine for the american people and it's being administered all across the country and David Perdue and kelly Lefler were there every step of the way throughout this challenging year. And we couldn't be more great. And finally, when it comes to the rule of law and our most cherished liberties. I couldn't be more proud to report to you that with their support in this president's leadership. We've already seen more than 220 conservatives appointed to our federal courts at every level and they are all principled men and women who will uphold the God given liberties in our constitution like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and remember the president nominates to the federal courts but it's the senators that confirm so none of that would have been possible without the strong and consistent support of Senator David Perdue and senator kelly left. In fact Georgia senators were there when we confirmed three justices to the Supreme Court including justice Neil Gorsuch, justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice. Amy coney Barrett get onto the last administration. You all remember our values and our freedoms were under steady assault. The last administration trampled on the religious liberty of americans on a regular basis compromise the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and religious charity. They even hauled a group of nuns known as the little sisters of the poor into federal court to order them to compromise their faith to live under the standards of Obamacare. And we saw that religious intolerance among democrats. Just a couple of years ago when Amy coney Barrett was going before the Judiciary Committee. You remember the democrat leader of that committee actually said she was concerned about Amy coney Barrett's christian faith because she said quote the dogma lives loudly within you and Hollywood liberals have been attacking Amy coney Barrett ever since. Well I got a message for the democrats in Washington D. C. And their friends in Hollywood that dogma lives loudly in me, that dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and worship according to the dictates of our faith. Lives loudly in the constitution of the United States of America. So for our liberties, for our freedoms, we need Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Lefler back in the United States Senate, you know, I think you all know especially the hardy bunch gathered out here today. The stakes in this election never been higher. It's choice has never been clear where David Perdue and kelly Leffler stands for a strong national defense, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are going to cut our national defense to fund their big government programs. You just watch where David Perdue and kelly Lefler cut taxes, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock want to raise taxes on working families and businesses all across the state of Georgia. In fact, Rafael Warnock was caught on tape saying that members of the Senate were Gangsters and thugs just for just for passing a tax cut for the people of Georgia and where David Perdue and kelly left her support our military and our most cherished ally radical liberal. Raphael Warnock has demeaned our military and repeatedly defended the anti Semitic rhetoric of reverend Jeremiah wright. In fact Rafael Warnock called our most cherished ally Israel an apartheid state. But with the strong support of kelly Lefler and David Perdue America stands with Israel and President trump moved the american embassy to Jerusalem the capital. And we're Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock support abortion on demand and support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. David Perdue. And kelly Leffler stand for the right to life. You all know what the stakes are, our liberties, our most cherished values, our prosperity, our security. But chuck schumer. Probably put it best. He said the other day, he said, quote now we take Georgia then we change America. Well, I got news for chuck schumer and the Washington democrats, We're gonna keep George, we're gonna save the Senate and then we're gonna save America. You know, I saw joe biden was in Atlanta this week. He gave a little speech, but he said in that speech, did you hear some of it? He said in that speech that Georgia doesn't need two senators that are quote, just going to get in the way. Well, Georgia, that's exactly what we need in the United States Senate. We need Senator David Perdue and Senator kelly Leffler to get in the way of their radical left agenda. We need David Perdue and kelly Leffler to get in the way of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and a Green new deal. We need two senators that will get in the way of the radical agenda of the Democratic Party and fight for Georgia every single day we need people across this state To say no to Ossoff and Warnock and Yes to David Perdue and Kelly Leffler on January five. So I came here today to say stay in the fight. And I don't think I need to tell this bunch that coming out on a cold and blustery day, give yourselves a round of applause dog now, really honored you here to stay in the fight. Stay in the fight for free and fair and honest elections in Georgia and all across America. Stay in the fight to defend the Republican majority in the Senate Until the polls close on January five. Stay in the fight to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to Washington, D. C. We need them there to keep America great. That really is what's on the line to preserve the progress we've made to protect our values and our liberties. We need you to vote Georgia, vote to send David Perdue and kelly Leffler back to the United States Senate. That's it. That's our that's that's that's what it's gonna take. And I can tell from the determination on all of your faces that, you know, it's you know what it's going to take from each one.

WE NEED SENATOR DAVID PERDUE BACK IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DAVID! DAVID! DAVID! VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: SO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I SUPPORT YOUR TWO SENATORS BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE. BUT WE ALSO ARE HERE JUST LIKE YOU ARE, BECAUSE OF ALL THAT WE DID TOGETHER. SERVING TOGETHER IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THINK ABOUT IT. FOUR YEARS AGO WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT BY RECKLESS BUDGET CUTS. AN ECONOMY STRUGGLING TO BREAK OUT OF THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. TERRORISM WAS ON THE RISE. AND WE WITNESSED THE STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR MOST CHERISHED VALUES. BUT WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE REVIVED OUR ECONOMY. WE SECURED OUR BORDER, STOOD WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND FOUGHT FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MEAN, JUST INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. BEING HERE, HOME TO FORT BENNING , I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO REPORT TO YOU, WITH THESE SENATORS' STRONG SUPPORT, WE'VE RESTORED THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. WE'RE FINALLY GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES AND COAST GUARDS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. IT'S TRUE. AND NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATOR DAVID PERDUE ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. THANK YOU, SENATOR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE LAST ADMINISTRATION SAW YEARS OF SCANDAL AT THE V.A. YOU REMEMBER. SCANDAL THAT SHOCKED THE COP SHENS OF THE NATION , CONSCIENCE OF THE NATION. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME INTO OFFICE, WITH THE SUPPORT OF YOUR TWO SENATORS, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACTUALLY SIGNED THE MOST SWEEPING REFORMS IN THE V.A. IN 50 YEARS. WE FIRED 5,000 V.A. EMPLOYEES THAT WEREN'T GIVING OUR VETERANS THE CARE THAT THEY EARNED AND VETERANS' CHOICE IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR EVERY VETERAN IN AMERICA. AND FROM HER SEAT ON THE VETERANS' AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER WAS THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY IN SOME 75 YEARS, WITH THE SUPPORT OF GEORGIA SENATORS, THIS PRESIDENT REVIVED OUR ECONOMY. WE CUT TAXES. WE ROLLED BACK REGULATIONS. WE FOUGHT FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE, UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY, AND IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED SEVEN MILLION GOOD-PAYING JOBS, INCLUDING 350,000 JOBS RIGHT HERE IN THE PEA STATE. WITH THE SUPPORT OF YOUR TWO SENATORS IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS, WE HAD A BLUE COLLAR BOOM GOING. THEN THE CORONAVIRUS STRUCK FROM CHINA. WITH THE SOLID FOUNDATION THAT WE POURED AND WITH THEIR SUPPORT EVERY DAY, WE LAUNCHED THE GREATEST NATIONAL MOBILIZATION SINCE WORLD WAR II. WE REINVENTED TESTING, WE SAW TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF BILLIONS OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES TO HOSPITALS AND NURSES. WE PROVIDED SUPPORT DIRECTLY TO FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES IMPACTED. IT'S REMARKABLE TO THINK, AFTER LOSING 22 MILLION JOBS AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, WITH THAT FOUNDATION THAT WE POURED, WE'VE ALREADY SEEN 12 MILLION AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK. WE'RE OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN. [APPLAUSE] AND WHILE THE OTHER SIDE SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE, WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF YOUR TWO SENATORS, THIS WEEK AMERICA WITNESSED THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. WE MADE HISTORY AND THE FIRST CORONAVIRUS VACCINE IS BEING ADMINISTERED IN EVERY STATE IN THE UNION. AND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER WERE THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY PUTTING THE HEALTH OF GEORGIA FIRST. [APPLAUSE] AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE RULE OF LAW, AND OUR MOST CHERISHED LIBERTIES, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE WITH A PRESIDENT AND TO STAND WITH TWO SENATORS WHO HAVE HELPED US APPOINT MORE THAN 220 CONSERVATIVES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS. [APPLAUSE] AND THEY'RE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION. THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S AMAZING TO THINK, NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE CONSIST SUPPORT OF SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER. IT WAS GEORGIA'S SENATORS WHO WERE THERE. ALL ALONG THE WAY. WHEN WE CONFIRMED MORE THAN 200 JUDGES, AND WHEN WE CONFIRMED THREE JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT, INCLUDING JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, YOU REMEMBER UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, OUR VALUES AND OUR FREEDOMS WERE UNDER REGULAR ASSAULT. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION TRAMPLED THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES OF AMERICANS ON A REGULAR BASIS. THEY COMPROMISED THE CONSCIENCE RIGHTS OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND RELIGIOUS CHARITIES. THEY EVEN HAULED A GROUP OF NUNS KNOWN AS THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR INTO FEDERAL COURT TO FORCE THEM TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH, TO LIVE UNDER THE MANDATES OF OBAMACARE. IN FACT, WE SAW THAT RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE TWO YEARS AGO WHEN AMY CONEY BARRETT WAS UP FOR HER FIRST SEAT ON THE COURT OF APPEALS. YOU REMEMBER IT? THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ACTUALLY SAID SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AMY CONEY BARRETT'S CHRISTIAN FAITH. SHE SAID, AND I QUOTE, THE DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY WITHIN YOU. AND HOLLYWOOD LIBERALS HAVE BEEN ATTACKING JUDGE BARRETT EVER SINCE. WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON. AND THEIR FRIENDS IN HOLLYWOOD. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN YOU. AND THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND WORSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF OUR FAITH LIVES LOUDLY IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO FOR OUR LIBERTIES, FOR OUR FREEDOMS, WE NEED SENATOR DAVID PERDUE AND SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER BACK IN THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. THE CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN CLEARER. WHERE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER STAND FOR A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE, THE OPPONENTS ARE GOING TO CUT OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE TO FUND THEIR BIG GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. YOU JUST WATCH. WHERE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER CUT TAXES, THE OTHERS WANT TO RAISE TAXES. ON WORKING FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES HERE IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. AND AS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN, WARNOCK IS ON TAPE CALLING MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE GANGSTERS JUST FOR VOTING TO CUT TAXES ON FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES IN THE PEACH STATE. AND WHERE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER SUPPORT OUR MILITARY, I MEAN, RADICAL LIBERAL WARNOCK ALONE HAS DEMEANED OUR MILITARY. HE'S REPEATEDLY DEFENDED THE ANTI-SEMITIC RHETORIC OF REVEREND JEREMIAH WRIGHT. IN FACT, RAFAEL WARNOCK CALLED OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLY, THE STRONG DEMOCRATIC JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL, AN APARTHEID STATE. AND HE COMPARED THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO EAST GERMAN STORM TROOPERS. WELL, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF KELLY LOEFFLER AND DAVID PERDUE TO SERVE ALONGSIDE OF A PRESIDENT WHO MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM. AND HAS STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WHERE JOHN AND WARNOCK SUPPORT ABORTION ON-DEMAND, AND TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, DAVID PURDUE , PERDUE, KELLY LOEFFLER, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE WILL ALWAYS STAND FOR THE RIGHT TO LIFE. YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THE STAKES ARE HERE IN GEORGIA. CHUCK SCHUMER SAID IT THE OTHER DAY. COULDN'T BE CLEARER. HE SAID, NOW WE TAKE GEORGIA, THEN WE CHANGE AMERICA. WELL, LET'S SEND A MESSAGE TO CHUCK SCHUMER AND THOSE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GEORGIA, WE'RE GOING TO SAVE THE SENATE, THEN WE'RE GOING TO SAVE AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, I SAW JOE BIDEN WAS IN ATLANTA JUST THE OTHER DAY. HE SAID THAT WE DIDN'T NEED TO SEND KELLY LOEFFLER AND DAVID PERDUE BACK TO WASHINGTON. BECAUSE HE SAID WE DON'T NEED TWO SENATORS THAT ARE, QUOTE, JUST GOING TO GET IN THE WAY. WELL, GEORGIA, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER TO GET IN THE WAY OF HIGHER TAXES! WE NEED DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER TO GET IN THE WAY OF OPEN BORDERS, SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, A GREEN NEW DEAL, ARE YOU WITH ME? WE NEED TWO GEORGIA SENATORS WHO WILL GET IN THE WAY OF THE RADICAL AGENDA OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND FIGHT FOR GEORGIA EVERY DAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHY WE NEED GEORGIA TO SAY NO TO THEM AND YES TO DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER. ON JANUARY 5. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AS I CAME HERE TODAY, WITH ONE MESSAGE. IT ALL COMES DOWN TO GEORGIA. SO STAY IN THE FIGHT. STAY IN THE FIGHT FOR INTEGRITY IN OUR ELECTIONS. STAY IN THE FIGHT TO DEFEND THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. UNTIL UNTIL , UNTIL THE POLLS CLOSE ON JANUARY 5, YOU STAY IN THE FIGHT UNTIL WE SEND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER BACK TO WASHINGTON, D.C. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT.

MY FELLOW AMERICANS, I SAY FROM MY HEART, YOU GOT TO REMEMBER, IF YOU DON'T VOTE, THEY WIN. IF YOU DON'T VOTE, THERE COULD BE NOTHING TO STOP CHUCK SCHUMER AND NANCY PELOSI FROM ADVANCING THEIR RADICAL LEFT AGENDA. CUTTING THE MILITARY, RAISES TAXES, TRAMPLING ON OUR VALUES. SO FOR ALL WE'VE DONE AND FOR ALL WE HAVE YET TO DO, FOR OUR PRESIDENT, FOR OUR FUTURE, FOR GEORGIA AND FOR AMERICA, CAST ANOTHER VOTE FOR ALL THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACCOMPLISHED, CAST THE VOTE TO SENT , SEND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOEFFLER BACK TO WASHINGTON, D.C.

AND NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATOR DAVID PERDUE ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. THANK YOU, SENATOR.

The two senators both faced runoffs against Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Reverend Rafael Warnock after none of the candidates got more than 50 percent of the vote in the 2020 election. Senators Perdue and Loeffler talked about the importance of the election, which could decide which party controls the Senate in the 117th Congress. While Vice President Pence expressed support for President Trump&rsquo;s continued legal battle to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, the vice president spoke of the Georgia Senate races as a chance for Republicans to &ldquo;hold the line&rdquo; against President-elect Joe Biden.	507397-1

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] STAY IN THE FIGHT TO DEFEND ALL WE'VE DONE, AND STAY IN THE FIGHT FROM THIS STUDENT ACTION SUMMIT AND EVERY DAY FORWARD TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT. [APPLAUSE] IT'S AMAZING TO THINK, WITH YOUR SUPPORT, WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP. AGAINST UNRELENTING RESISTANCE AND ATTACKS FROM THE DEMOCRATS, THE RADICAL LEFT, AND THEIR ALLIES IN THE MEDIA. [CROWD BOOING] WE'VE MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY HOLLOWED OUT BY RECKLESS BUDGET CUTS, AN ECONOMY STRUGGLING TO BREAK OUT OF THE WORST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. TERRORISM WAS ON THE RISE, AND WE WITNESSED A STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR MOST CHERISHED VALUES. BUT WITH YOUR SUPPORT, UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE REVIVED THIS ECONOMY. WE SECURED OUR BORDER, STOOD WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND WE FOUGHT FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT'S AN HONOR TO BE YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, BUT THE HIGHEST TITLE I'LL EVER HOLD IS D-A-D. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, AND AS THE PROUD FATHER OF A UNITED STATES MARINE, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE A PRESIDENT WHO CARES SO DEEPLY ABOUT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR ARMED FORCES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACTUALLY SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE FINALLY GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, COAST GUARD, AND SPACE FORCE THE SUPPORT THEY DESERVE TO DEFEND THIS NATION. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT'S TRUE. AND WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE'VE STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AND WE'VE STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES. WE TOOK THE FIGHT TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ON OUR TERMS ON THEIR SOIL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AT THE DIRECTION OF OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES TOOK DOWN THE LAST INCH OF TERRITORY UNDER THE BLACK FLAG OF ISIS AND TOOK OUT THEIR LEADER WITHOUT ONE AMERICAN CASUALTY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WITHDREW FROM THE DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND WHEN THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD, AN IRANIAN GENERAL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN SERVICE MEMBERS WAS IN OUR SITES, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK ACTION, AND QASEM SOLEIMANI IS GONE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! SO WE REBUILD OUR MILITARY AND STAY STRONG ON THE WORLD. UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, WE REVIVE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY IN 75 YEARS, PRESIDENT TRUMP CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES. WE ROLLBACK REGULATION AT A HISTORIC PACE. FAIR TRADE AND UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY. IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO TO THE DAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THE LARGEST TAX CUTS AND TAX REFORM IN HISTORY. THE RESULT, IN THREE SHORT YEARS, BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED MORE THAN 7 MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS. WAGES ROSE AT THEIR FASTEST PACE IN 10 YEARS. AND THEY ROSE MOST RAPIDLY FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HISPANIC AMERICANS, THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN ARE FORGOTTEN NO MORE. AFTER OUR FIRST THREE YEARS IN OFFICE, MOST AMERICANS , MORE AMERICANS WERE WORKING THAN EVER BEFORE. THEN 2020 ARRIVED. AND THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC STRUCK FROM CHINA. AND UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, AMERICA RESPONDED. WE LOST THE LARGEST NATIONAL MOBILIZATION. WE REINVENTED TESTING FROM A START. WE SAW THE DELIVERY OF BILLIONS OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT THAT HOSPITALS ALL ACROSS THE LAND SECURED DIRECT SUPPORT FOR BUSINESSES AND WORKING FAMILIES THAT HAVE SAVED . , THAT HAVE SAVED LIVES EVERY SINGLE DAY. AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, 22 MILLION AMERICANS LOST THEIR JOBS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BECAUSE OF THE STRONG FOUNDATION THIS PRESIDENT PUT FORTH. BECAUSE OF UNPRECEDENTED SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES, WE HAVE SEEN MORE THAN 12 MILLION AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK. WE ARE OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN. AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, AFTER A YEAR OF HARDSHIP AND AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, AFTER A YEAR OF HARDSHIP AND HEARTBREAK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, PRESIDENT TRUMP DELIVERED ON HIS PROMISE. AND TODAY, WE HAVE NOT ONE, BUT TWO SAFE AND EFFECTIVE CORONAVIRUS VACCINES BEING ADMINISTERED ALL ACROSS AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] SOME SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE, BUT IN THIS SEASON OF HOPE, HOPE IS ON THE WAY. AND THANKS TO YOUR PRESIDENT AND INCREDIBLE AMERICAN INGENUITY UNDER OPERATION WARP SPEED, WE HAVE COME TO THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. IT'S A MEDICAL MIRACLE, AND A PROMISE MADE, AND A PROMISE KEPT. SO WE'RE HEALING AMERICA, AND ALL ALONG THE WAY, LIKE ALL OF YOU, WE'VE BEEN DEFENDING FREEDOM. AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO TELL YOU, AS OF TODAY, THIS PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY SEEN APPOINTED MORE THAN 220 CONSERVATIVES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS AT EVERY LEVEL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND THEY ARE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD ALL THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION, LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. AND THAT INCLUDES JUSTICE, NEIL GORSUCH, JUSTICE, BRETT KAVANAUGH, AND JUSTICE, AMY CONEY BARRETT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ACB. ACB. ACB. ACB. ACB. ACB. VICE PRES. PENCE: ISN'T SHE GREAT? ISN'T SHE GREAT? DIDN'T YOU LIKE IT IN THAT HEARING, THEY SAID TO HER, THEY SAID, ""WHAT DO YOU GOT WRITTEN ON THAT PIECE OF PAPER IN FRONT OF YOU THERE?"" AND SHE SAID, ""NOTHING."" RIGHT? [APPLAUSE] AND THOSE APPOINTMENTS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE, BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS BEFORE WE TOOK OFFICE, UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, YOU REMEMBER IT, WE SAW A STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR VALUES AND ON OUR FREEDOMS. [CROWD BOOING] THE LAST ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY TRAMPLED ON THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY OF AMERICANS, VIOLATED THE CONSCIENCE RIGHTS OF DOCTORS, AND NURSES, AND RELIGIOUS CHARITIES. THEY EVEN HAULED A GROUP OF CATHOLIC NUNS INTO FEDERAL COURT TO ORDER THEM TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH TO LIVE UNDER THE STANDARDS OF OBAMACARE. [CROWD BOOING] IN FACT, WE SAW THAT RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WRIT LARGE WHEN AMY CONEY BARRETT WAS UP FOR A COURT OF APPEALS POST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. YOU REMEMBER? THE NUMBER ONE DEMOCRAT ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAID THAT SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AMY CONEY BARRETT'S CHRISTIAN FAITH. IN FACT, SHE SAID, AND I QUOTE, BECAUSE, ""THE DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY WITHIN YOU."" [CROWD BOOING] AND HOLLYWOOD LIBERALS HAVE BEEN ATTACKING AMY CONEY BARRETT FOR HER CHRISTIAN FAITH EVER SINCE EVERYTHING. WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON AND THEIR HOLLYWOOD FRIENDS. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN ME. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN YOU. AND THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND WORSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF OUR FAITH LIVES LOUDLY IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHY THESE COURT APPOINTMENTS HAVE BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. IT'S ALSO WHY THAT GEORGIA RACE, LOEFFLER AND PERDUE, ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU, WE'VE DEFENDED OUR FIRST FREEDOM, THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, BUT WE'VE ALSO STOOD STRONG FOR THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH ON CAMPUSES ACROSS AMERICA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JUSTICE ALITO GAVE A SPEECH A LITTLE WHILE BACK TO THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY. YOU OUGHT TO CHECK IT OUT. HE SAID, AND I QUOTE, ""WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO PREVENT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH FROM BECOMING A SECOND-TIER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT."" [APPLAUSE] AND THAT'S JUST WHAT WE'VE DONE. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, WE'VE GONE INTO FEDERAL COURT TO DEFEND THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH ON CAMPUSES IN AMERICA. AND THIS PRESIDENT SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTING FEDERAL AGENCIES TO TIE RESEARCH GRANTS TO THE DEFENSE OF THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. T.P., USA, WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THE FREEDOM OF THOUGHT AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ON OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND CAMPUSES ACROSS AMERICA. GOT TO STAND UP. [APPLAUSE] SO THE PRESIDENT HAS STOOD STRONG OUR ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION FOR ALL OF OUR FREEDOMS, AND THE VALUES THAT HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. AND MAYBE MOST OF ALL, TO ME. WE LOVE YOU, MIKE. VICE PRES. PENCE: I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO A PRESIDENT WHO HAS STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT'S TRUE. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. VICE PRES. PENCE: SO I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS. SO FOR ALL WE'VE DONE, FOR ALL WE HAVE YET TO DO, STAY IN THE FIGHT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] STAY IN THE FIGHT IN OUR ELECTION. STAY IN THE FIGHT IN GEORGIA'S ELECTION, AND STAY IN THE FIGHT EVERY DAY THAT FOLLOWS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. VICE PRES. PENCE: WE NEED YOU TO STAY IN THE FIGHT, TO BE A CHECK ON WHAT THE DEMOCRATS AND THE RADICAL LEFT WANT TO DO, AND WHAT THEY WANT TO UNDO. ALL THAT WE'VE DONE. OUR AGENDA IS ABOUT AMERICAN GREATNESS. THEIR AGENDA IS ABOUT AMERICAN DECLINE. [CROWD BOOING] WHERE WE CUT TAXES, ROLL BACK REGULATION AND ADVANCED FREEDOM, THEIR AGENDA IS HIGHER TAXES, OPEN BORDERS, SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, A GREEN NEW DEAL, AND ABORTION ON DEMAND. [CROWD BOOING] THEY WANT TO MAKE RICH PEOPLE POOR, AND POOR PEOPLE MORE COMFORTABLE. WE HAVE FOUGHT TO MAKE EVERY AMERICAN RICHER, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN AMERICA ROSE BY THE LARGEST AMOUNT EVER RECORDED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] A RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL BOATS. SO MEN AND WOMEN OF T.P., USA, YOU STAY IN THE FIGHT. TO FINISH WHAT WE STARTED. THE PRESIDENT AND I ARE COUNTING ON ALL OF YOU. WE NEED YOUR VOICES. WE GOT YOUR BACK. VICE PRES. PENCE: WE NEED THIS ENERGY. AND WE NEED YOUR VISION. WE NEED YOU TO STAY IN THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM. BECAUSE THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM NEVER ENDS. MY SECOND FAVORITE PRESIDENT USED TO SAY, ""FREEDOM IS NEVER MORE THAN ONE GENERATION AWAY FROM EXTINCTION."" [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT LOOKING OUT AT THE ENTHUSIASM REPRESENTED HERE, IN THIS GENERATION, I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS GENERATION FOR FREEDOM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] TODAY, DEMOCRATS OPENLY ADVOCATE AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT HAS IMPOVERISHED MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD. [CROWD BOOING] UNDER THE GUISE OF MEDICARE FOR ALL AND A GREEN NEW DEAL, DEMOCRATS ARE EMBRACING THE SAME TIRED ECONOMIC THEORIES THAT HAVE IMPOVERISHED NATIONS AND STIFLED THE LIBERTIES OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OVER THE PAST CENTURY. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR. IT WAS FREEDOM, NOT SOCIALISM, THAT GAVE US THE MOST PROSPEROUS ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT WAS FREEDOM, NOT SOCIALISM, THAT ENDED SLAVERY, WON TWO WORLD WARS, AND STANDS TODAY AS A BEACON OF HOPE FOR ALL THE WORLD. IT WAS FREEDOM, NOT SOCIALISM, THAT'S MOVING US BEYOND THE PREJUDICES OF THE PAST TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION, AND EXTEND THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY TO EVERY AMERICAN, REGARDLESS OF RACE OR CREED OR COLOR. IT'S FREEDOM. [APPLAUSE] AND YOU HERE AT TPUS UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS FREEDOM, NOT SOCIALISM, THAT GAVE US THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF LIFE, THE CLEANEST ENVIRONMENT ON EARTH, HAS IMPROVED THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD. AND SO, I CHALLENGE YOU, IN THIS GENERATION, ON THIS DAY AND EVERY DAY FORWARD, TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE. THAT AMERICA WILL BE A LAND OF FREEDOM, AND AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SO IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE WITH YOU TODAY WITH THIS RISING GENERATION OF CONSERVATIVE LEADERS. YOU ARE AN IMPRESSIVE SITE. , SIGHT. AND I CAME HERE TODAY TO THANK YOU AND TO CHALLENGE YOU. BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR MOMENT. THREE YEARS AGO, IN POLAND, PRESIDENT TRUMP DECLARED, AND I QUOTE, ""THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF OUR TIME IS WHETHER THE WESTQUOTE, THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF OUR TIME IS WHETHER THE WEST HAS THE WILL TO SURVIVE. AND AS WE GATHER HERE TODAY, WE ASK OURSELVES THE VERY SAME QUESTION. DO YOU HAVE THE CONFIDENCE IN OUR IDEALS AND VALUES TO DEFEND THEM AGAINST OPPOSITION AND RESISTANCE AND CRITICISM AND RIDICULE? DO YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO FIGHT FOR FREEDOM? I KNOW YOU DO. IT IS CLEAR TO ME I'M NOT JUST LOOKING AT LEADERS OF A GENERATION OR THE FUTURE LEADERS OF THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT. I'M LOOKING AT THE FUTURE LEADERS OF AMERICA. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE FAITH. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIFE OF YOUR FAMILY, YOUR COMMUNITY, YOUR STATE. IT IS THE FIRST TEST OF SOMEONE THAT WOULD STEP INTO THE PUBLIC SQUARE. BE WILLING TO LOOK PEOPLE IN THE EYE, SAY I HAVE A HEART TO SERVE, STEP FORWARD, AND LEAD AMERICA. AND HAVE FAITH IN THIS PRESIDENT THAT WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING. WHO BUILT THE BIGGEST AND BROADEST COALITION OF CONSERVATIVES IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY AND IS GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. HAVE FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I TRULY DO BELIEVE THAT A CAREFUL STUDY OF AMERICAN HISTORY SHOWS, EVERY TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE PRESENTED WITH A VISION AND WITH LEADERSHIP FOUNDED IN FREEDOM, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CHOOSE FREEDOM EVERY TIME. SO AS YOU RETURN TO YOUR HOMES AND STAY IN THE FIGHT AND YOU SPEAK UP, BE CONFIDENT. BE CONFIDENT IN YOURSELVES, BE CONFIDENT IN THE LEADERSHIP THAT WE HAVE IN THIS PRESIDENT AND ALL OF US WHO SERVE AROUND THEM, AND BE CONFIDENT THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE READY, WILLING, AND ABLE. INSCRIBED ON THE SIDE OF THE LIBERTY BELL IS AN ANCIENT VERSE. IT SAYS, ""PROCLAIM LIBERTY THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND AND UNTO ALL THE INHABITANTS THEREOF."" WHEN WE PROCLAIM LIBERTY IN THESE UNITED STATES, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE RALLY TO OUR CAUSE. YOU GO DO IT. AND FINALLY, AFTER THIS CHALLENGING YEAR, IF YOU WERE OF A MIND ON THIS CHRISTMAS WEEK, I'D ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE TIME , ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE TIME TO BE STILL. REFLECT ON THE BLESSINGS IN YOUR LIFE. THE BLESSINGS OF YOUR FAMILIES, THE BLESSINGS OF HAVING BEEN BORN AND RAISED IN THE GREATEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND ALSO TAKE A MOMENT TO BE STILL, AND IF YOU'RE INCLINED, THIS IS WHAT WE DO AT MY HOUSE COME CHRISTMAS MORNING, TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON THE GRACE THAT CAME TO MANKIND, WRAPPED IN CLOTHES AND LYING IN A MANGER SO MANY YEARS AGO. MIKE PENCE: (27:55) FOR ALL THE , FOR ALL THE BATTLES BEHIND US, FOR ALL THE BATTLES WE'RE IN TODAY, BATTLES THAT LIE AHEAD, WE DO WELL TO REMEMBER, HERE AT THIS STUDENT ACTION SUMMIT, THAT EVEN YOUTHS GROW TIRED AND WEARY, AND THE YOUNG STUMBLE AND FALL. BUT AS THE BIBLE TELLS US, THOSE WHO WAIT ON THE LORD WILL RENEW THEIR STRENGTH, WILL SOAR ON WINGS LIKE EAGLES. YOU WILL RUN AND NOT GROW WEARY, YOU WILL WALK AND NOT BE FAINT. PROCLAIM THAT GRACE AND RUN THE RACE. I BELIEVE IF YOU DO THAT, YOU BELIEVE IN THAT DREAM THAT'S IN YOUR HEART TO SERVE AND TO LEAD, AND YOU TRUST THE LEADERS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED UP THIS TIME IN THE LIFE OF OUR NATION, BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND PUT YOUR FAITH IN HIM WHO HAS EVER GUIDED THE DESTINY OF THIS GREAT LAND, I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OUR FREEDOM FOR THIS GENERATION AND THE NEXT, AND THE BEST DAYS FOR THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT, AND FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ARE YET TO COME. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

IT'S AMAZING TO THINK, WITH YOUR SUPPORT, WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP. AGAINST UNRELENTING RESISTANCE AND ATTACKS FROM THE DEMOCRATS, THE RADICAL LEFT, AND THEIR ALLIES IN THE MEDIA. WE'VE MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY HOLLOWED OUT BY RECKLESS BUDGET CUTS, AN ECONOMY STRUGGLING TO BREAK OUT OF THE WORST RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. TERRORISM WAS ON THE RISE, AND WE WITNESSED A STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR MOST CHERISHED VALUES. BUT WITH YOUR SUPPORT, UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE REVIVED THIS ECONOMY. WE SECURED OUR BORDER, STOOD WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND WE FOUGHT FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, BUT THE HIGHEST TITLE I'LL EVER HOLD IS D-A-D. AND AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, AND AS THE PROUD FATHER OF A UNITED STATES MARINE, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE A PRESIDENT WHO CARES SO DEEPLY ABOUT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR ARMED FORCES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACTUALLY SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. WE'RE FINALLY GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, COAST GUARD, AND SPACE FORCE THE SUPPORT THEY DESERVE TO DEFEND THIS NATION. IT'S TRUE. AND WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE'VE STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AND WE'VE STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES. WE TOOK THE FIGHT TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ON OUR TERMS ON THEIR SOIL. AT THE DIRECTION OF OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES TOOK DOWN THE LAST INCH OF TERRITORY UNDER THE BLACK FLAG OF ISIS AND TOOK OUT THEIR LEADER WITHOUT ONE AMERICAN CASUALTY. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WITHDREW FROM THE DISASTROUS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. AND WHEN THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD, AN IRANIAN GENERAL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN SERVICE MEMBERS WAS IN OUR SITES, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK ACTION, AND QASEM SOLEIMANI IS GONE. USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! SO WE REBUILD OUR MILITARY AND STAY STRONG ON THE WORLD. UNDER THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, WE REVIVE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY IN 75 YEARS, PRESIDENT TRUMP CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES. WE ROLLBACK REGULATION AT A HISTORIC PACE. FAIR TRADE AND UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY. IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO TO THE DAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THE LARGEST TAX CUTS AND TAX REFORM IN HISTORY. THE RESULT, IN THREE SHORT YEARS, BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL CREATED MORE THAN 7 MILLION GOOD PAYING JOBS. WAGES ROSE AT THEIR FASTEST PACE IN 10 YEARS. AND THEY ROSE MOST RAPIDLY FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HISPANIC AMERICANS, THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN ARE FORGOTTEN NO MORE. AFTER OUR FIRST THREE YEARS IN OFFICE, MOST AMERICANS , MORE AMERICANS WERE WORKING THAN EVER BEFORE. THEN 2020 ARRIVED. AND THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC STRUCK FROM CHINA. AND UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, AMERICA RESPONDED. WE LOST THE LARGEST NATIONAL MOBILIZATION. WE REINVENTED TESTING FROM A START. WE SAW THE DELIVERY OF BILLIONS OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT THAT HOSPITALS ALL ACROSS THE LAND SECURED DIRECT SUPPORT FOR BUSINESSES AND WORKING FAMILIES THAT HAVE SAVED . , THAT HAVE SAVED LIVES EVERY SINGLE DAY. AT THE HEIGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC, 22 MILLION AMERICANS LOST THEIR JOBS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BECAUSE OF THE STRONG FOUNDATION THIS PRESIDENT PUT FORTH. BECAUSE OF UNPRECEDENTED SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES, WE HAVE SEEN MORE THAN 12 MILLION AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK. WE ARE OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN. AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, AFTER A YEAR OF HARDSHIP AND AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, AFTER A YEAR OF HARDSHIP AND HEARTBREAK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, PRESIDENT TRUMP DELIVERED ON HIS PROMISE. AND TODAY, WE HAVE NOT ONE, BUT TWO SAFE AND EFFECTIVE CORONAVIRUS VACCINES BEING ADMINISTERED ALL ACROSS AMERICA. SOME SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE, BUT IN THIS SEASON OF HOPE, HOPE IS ON THE WAY. AND THANKS TO YOUR PRESIDENT AND INCREDIBLE AMERICAN INGENUITY UNDER OPERATION WARP SPEED, WE HAVE COME TO THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. IT'S A MEDICAL MIRACLE, AND A PROMISE MADE, AND A PROMISE KEPT. SO WE'RE HEALING AMERICA, AND ALL ALONG THE WAY, LIKE ALL OF YOU, WE'VE BEEN DEFENDING FREEDOM. AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO TELL YOU, AS OF TODAY, THIS PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY SEEN APPOINTED MORE THAN 220 CONSERVATIVES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS AT EVERY LEVEL. AND THEY ARE ALL MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL UPHOLD ALL THE GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION, LIKE THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. AND THAT INCLUDES JUSTICE, NEIL GORSUCH, JUSTICE, BRETT KAVANAUGH, AND JUSTICE, AMY CONEY BARRETT. ACB. ACB. ACB. ACB. ACB. ACB. ISN'T SHE GREAT? ISN'T SHE GREAT? DIDN'T YOU LIKE IT IN THAT HEARING, THEY SAID TO HER, THEY SAID, 'WHAT DO YOU GOT WRITTEN ON THAT PIECE OF PAPER IN FRONT OF YOU THERE?' AND SHE SAID, 'NOTHING.' RIGHT? AND THOSE APPOINTMENTS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE, BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS BEFORE WE TOOK OFFICE, UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, YOU REMEMBER IT, WE SAW A STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR VALUES AND ON OUR FREEDOMS. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY TRAMPLED ON THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY OF AMERICANS, VIOLATED THE CONSCIENCE RIGHTS OF DOCTORS, AND NURSES, AND RELIGIOUS CHARITIES. THEY EVEN HAULED A GROUP OF CATHOLIC NUNS INTO FEDERAL COURT TO ORDER THEM TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH TO LIVE UNDER THE STANDARDS OF OBAMACARE. IN FACT, WE SAW THAT RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WRIT LARGE WHEN AMY CONEY BARRETT WAS UP FOR A COURT OF APPEALS POST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. YOU REMEMBER? THE NUMBER ONE DEMOCRAT ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAID THAT SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AMY CONEY BARRETT'S CHRISTIAN FAITH. IN FACT, SHE SAID, AND I QUOTE, BECAUSE, 'THE DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY WITHIN YOU.' AND HOLLYWOOD LIBERALS HAVE BEEN ATTACKING AMY CONEY BARRETT FOR HER CHRISTIAN FAITH EVER SINCE EVERYTHING. WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON AND THEIR HOLLYWOOD FRIENDS. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN ME. THAT DOGMA LIVES LOUDLY IN YOU. AND THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND WORSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF OUR FAITH LIVES LOUDLY IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT'S WHY THESE COURT APPOINTMENTS HAVE BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. IT'S ALSO WHY THAT GEORGIA RACE, LOEFFLER AND PERDUE, ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU, WE'VE DEFENDED OUR FIRST FREEDOM, THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION, BUT WE'VE ALSO STOOD STRONG FOR THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH ON CAMPUSES ACROSS AMERICA. JUSTICE ALITO GAVE A SPEECH A LITTLE WHILE BACK TO THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY. YOU OUGHT TO CHECK IT OUT. HE SAID, AND I QUOTE, 'WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO PREVENT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH FROM BECOMING A SECOND-TIER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.' AND THAT'S JUST WHAT WE'VE DONE. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, WE'VE GONE INTO FEDERAL COURT TO DEFEND THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH ON CAMPUSES IN AMERICA. AND THIS PRESIDENT SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTING FEDERAL AGENCIES TO TIE RESEARCH GRANTS TO THE DEFENSE OF THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. T.P., USA, WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THE FREEDOM OF THOUGHT AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ON OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND CAMPUSES ACROSS AMERICA. GOT TO STAND UP. SO THE PRESIDENT HAS STOOD STRONG OUR ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION FOR ALL OF OUR FREEDOMS, AND THE VALUES THAT HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. AND MAYBE MOST OF ALL, TO ME. WE LOVE YOU, MIKE. I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO BE VICE PRESIDENT TO A PRESIDENT WHO HAS STOOD WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IT'S TRUE. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. SO I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS. SO FOR ALL WE'VE DONE, FOR ALL WE HAVE YET TO DO, STAY IN THE FIGHT. STAY IN THE FIGHT IN OUR ELECTION. STAY IN THE FIGHT IN GEORGIA'S ELECTION, AND STAY IN THE FIGHT EVERY DAY THAT FOLLOWS. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. STOP THE STEAL. WE NEED YOU TO STAY IN THE FIGHT, TO BE A CHECK ON WHAT THE DEMOCRATS AND THE RADICAL LEFT WANT TO DO, AND WHAT THEY WANT TO UNDO. ALL THAT WE'VE DONE. OUR AGENDA IS ABOUT AMERICAN GREATNESS. THEIR AGENDA IS ABOUT AMERICAN DECLINE. WHERE WE CUT TAXES, ROLL BACK REGULATION AND ADVANCED FREEDOM, THEIR AGENDA IS HIGHER TAXES, OPEN BORDERS, SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, A GREEN NEW DEAL, AND ABORTION ON DEMAND. THEY WANT TO MAKE RICH PEOPLE POOR, AND POOR PEOPLE MORE COMFORTABLE. WE HAVE FOUGHT TO MAKE EVERY AMERICAN RICHER, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE. UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN AMERICA ROSE BY THE LARGEST AMOUNT EVER RECORDED. A RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL BOATS. SO MEN AND WOMEN OF T.P., USA, YOU STAY IN THE FIGHT. TO FINISH WHAT WE STARTED. THE PRESIDENT AND I ARE COUNTING ON ALL OF YOU. WE NEED YOUR VOICES. WE GOT YOUR BACK. WE NEED THIS ENERGY. AND WE NEED YOUR VISION. WE NEED YOU TO STAY IN THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM. BECAUSE THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM NEVER ENDS. MY SECOND FAVORITE PRESIDENT USED TO SAY, 'FREEDOM IS NEVER MORE THAN ONE GENERATION AWAY FROM EXTINCTION.' BUT LOOKING OUT AT THE ENTHUSIASM REPRESENTED HERE, IN THIS GENERATION, I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS GENERATION FOR FREEDOM. TODAY, DEMOCRATS OPENLY ADVOCATE AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT HAS IMPOVERISHED MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD. UNDER THE GUISE OF MEDICARE FOR ALL AND A GREEN NEW DEAL, DEMOCRATS ARE EMBRACING THE SAME TIRED ECONOMIC THEORIES THAT HAVE IMPOVERISHED NATIONS AND STIFLED THE LIBERTIES OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OVER THE PAST CENTURY. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR. IT WAS FREEDOM, NOT SOCIALISM, THAT GAVE US THE MOST PROSPEROUS ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. IT WAS FREEDOM, NOT SOCIALISM, THAT ENDED SLAVERY, WON TWO WORLD WARS, AND STANDS TODAY AS A BEACON OF HOPE FOR ALL THE WORLD. IT WAS FREEDOM, NOT SOCIALISM, THAT'S MOVING US BEYOND THE PREJUDICES OF THE PAST TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION, AND EXTEND THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY TO EVERY AMERICAN, REGARDLESS OF RACE OR CREED OR COLOR. IT'S FREEDOM. AND YOU HERE AT TPUS UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS FREEDOM, NOT SOCIALISM, THAT GAVE US THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF LIFE, THE CLEANEST ENVIRONMENT ON EARTH, HAS IMPROVED THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD. AND SO, I CHALLENGE YOU, IN THIS GENERATION, ON THIS DAY AND EVERY DAY FORWARD, TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE. THAT AMERICA WILL BE A LAND OF FREEDOM, AND AMERICA WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. SO IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE WITH YOU TODAY WITH THIS RISING GENERATION OF CONSERVATIVE LEADERS. YOU ARE AN IMPRESSIVE SITE. , SIGHT. AND I CAME HERE TODAY TO THANK YOU AND TO CHALLENGE YOU. BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR MOMENT. THREE YEARS AGO, IN POLAND, PRESIDENT TRUMP DECLARED, AND I QUOTE, 'THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF OUR TIME IS WHETHER THE WESTQUOTE, THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF OUR TIME IS WHETHER THE WEST HAS THE WILL TO SURVIVE. AND AS WE GATHER HERE TODAY, WE ASK OURSELVES THE VERY SAME QUESTION. DO YOU HAVE THE CONFIDENCE IN OUR IDEALS AND VALUES TO DEFEND THEM AGAINST OPPOSITION AND RESISTANCE AND CRITICISM AND RIDICULE? DO YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO FIGHT FOR FREEDOM? I KNOW YOU DO. IT IS CLEAR TO ME I'M NOT JUST LOOKING AT LEADERS OF A GENERATION OR THE FUTURE LEADERS OF THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT. I'M LOOKING AT THE FUTURE LEADERS OF AMERICA. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE FAITH. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIFE OF YOUR FAMILY, YOUR COMMUNITY, YOUR STATE. IT IS THE FIRST TEST OF SOMEONE THAT WOULD STEP INTO THE PUBLIC SQUARE. BE WILLING TO LOOK PEOPLE IN THE EYE, SAY I HAVE A HEART TO SERVE, STEP FORWARD, AND LEAD AMERICA. AND HAVE FAITH IN THIS PRESIDENT THAT WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING. WHO BUILT THE BIGGEST AND BROADEST COALITION OF CONSERVATIVES IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY AND IS GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. HAVE FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I TRULY DO BELIEVE THAT A CAREFUL STUDY OF AMERICAN HISTORY SHOWS, EVERY TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE PRESENTED WITH A VISION AND WITH LEADERSHIP FOUNDED IN FREEDOM, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CHOOSE FREEDOM EVERY TIME. SO AS YOU RETURN TO YOUR HOMES AND STAY IN THE FIGHT AND YOU SPEAK UP, BE CONFIDENT. BE CONFIDENT IN YOURSELVES, BE CONFIDENT IN THE LEADERSHIP THAT WE HAVE IN THIS PRESIDENT AND ALL OF US WHO SERVE AROUND THEM, AND BE CONFIDENT THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE READY, WILLING, AND ABLE. INSCRIBED ON THE SIDE OF THE LIBERTY BELL IS AN ANCIENT VERSE. IT SAYS, 'PROCLAIM LIBERTY THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND AND UNTO ALL THE INHABITANTS THEREOF.' WHEN WE PROCLAIM LIBERTY IN THESE UNITED STATES, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE RALLY TO OUR CAUSE. YOU GO DO IT. AND FINALLY, AFTER THIS CHALLENGING YEAR, IF YOU WERE OF A MIND ON THIS CHRISTMAS WEEK, I'D ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE TIME , ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE TIME TO BE STILL. REFLECT ON THE BLESSINGS IN YOUR LIFE. THE BLESSINGS OF YOUR FAMILIES, THE BLESSINGS OF HAVING BEEN BORN AND RAISED IN THE GREATEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND ALSO TAKE A MOMENT TO BE STILL, AND IF YOU'RE INCLINED, THIS IS WHAT WE DO AT MY HOUSE COME CHRISTMAS MORNING, TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON THE GRACE THAT CAME TO MANKIND, WRAPPED IN CLOTHES AND LYING IN A MANGER SO MANY YEARS AGO. MIKE FOR ALL THE , FOR ALL THE BATTLES BEHIND US, FOR ALL THE BATTLES WE'RE IN TODAY, BATTLES THAT LIE AHEAD, WE DO WELL TO REMEMBER, HERE AT THIS STUDENT ACTION SUMMIT, THAT EVEN YOUTHS GROW TIRED AND WEARY, AND THE YOUNG STUMBLE AND FALL. BUT AS THE BIBLE TELLS US, THOSE WHO WAIT ON THE LORD WILL RENEW THEIR STRENGTH, WILL SOAR ON WINGS LIKE EAGLES. YOU WILL RUN AND NOT GROW WEARY, YOU WILL WALK AND NOT BE FAINT. PROCLAIM THAT GRACE AND RUN THE RACE. I BELIEVE IF YOU DO THAT, YOU BELIEVE IN THAT DREAM THAT'S IN YOUR HEART TO SERVE AND TO LEAD, AND YOU TRUST THE LEADERS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED UP THIS TIME IN THE LIFE OF OUR NATION, BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND PUT YOUR FAITH IN HIM WHO HAS EVER GUIDED THE DESTINY OF THIS GREAT LAND, I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OUR FREEDOM FOR THIS GENERATION AND THE NEXT, AND THE BEST DAYS FOR THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT, AND FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ARE YET TO COME. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS AMERICA.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?507500-1/vice-president-pence-turning-point-usa-student-action-summit	Vice President Mike Pence delivered remarks at Turning Point USA in West Palm Beach, Florida.

IT WOULD BE ENOUGH AND SEND THEM BACK BECAUSE OF ALL WE ACCOMPLISHED TOGETHER OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND WE NEED TO SEND THEM BACK TO WASHINGTON D.C. BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN SENATE MAJORITY COULD BE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE TO PRESERVE ALL WE HAVE DONE TO REVIVE OUR ECONOMY AND PRESERVE THE GOD-GIVEN LITS THAT WE HOLD DEAR. [APPLAUSE] A FOURTH GENERATION FARM GIRL FROM THE HEARTLAND WHO MOVED DOWN HERE TO MOVE DOWN TO GAY AND BUILT A COMPANY AND BUILT BARRIERS AND BUILT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESSES AND SHE IS HE MERGING ONE OF THE MOST VOICES ON CAPITOL HILL.

WE HAVE TO SEND HIM BACK. [APPLAUSE] EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THEIR STALWART SUPPORT AND THINK ABOUT IT. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT WAS HALL OOD OUT, AN ECONOMY TO STRUGGLE OUT. TRIM WAS ON THE RISE AROUND THE WORLD AND WE WITNESSED THE STEADY ASSAULT ON OUR MOST CHERISHED VALUES. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP TRUM AND GEORGIA'S TWO SENATORS, WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY AND SECURED OUR BORDER AND FOUGHT FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHANTING FOUR MORE YEARS] AMAZING TO THINK WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND BEGINS WITH OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE. I'M YOUR VICE PRESIDENT BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT TITLE I WILL HOLD IS SPELLED D A.D. [APPLAUSE] ONE OF MY UNWORTHY SON-IN-LAWS IS A NAVY PILOT. THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE LARGEST INCREASE IN OUR DEFENSE. WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY AND GIVE QUEN OUR SERVICEMEN AND SPACE FORCE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DEFEND OUR NATION NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SENATOR DAVID PERDUE FROM HIS SEAT ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. [APPLAUSE] YOU ALL REMEMBER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION YEARS OF SCANDAL AT THE V.A., REMEMBER? WE HAD AMERICA'S HEROES AND MANY CASES THAT WERE PASSES AWAY ON WAITING LISTS. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME INTO OFFICE, THOSE DAYS WERE OVER. WE PASSED THE MOST SWEEPING REFORM OF THE V.A. IN 50 YEARS AND VETERANS' CHOICE IS AVAILABLE FOR EVERY VETERAN IN AMERICA. AND FROM HER POSITION ON THE VETERANS' AFFAIR COMMITTEE, SENATOR LOEFFLER HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR OUR VETERANS EVERY DAY. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY AFTER THE SLOWEST RECOVERY IN 75 YEARS, WE CUT TAXES, WE ROLLED BACK REGULAR LIKES AND UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY AND BUSINESSES PROVIDED JOBS INCLUDING 350,000 JOBS RIGHT HERE IN THE PEACH STATE. [APPLAUSE] WAGES WERE RISING ACROSS THE BOARD. WAGES WERE RAISING. THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN WERE FORGOTTEN NO MORE. TRUE. SO WE WERE MAKING EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS, THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION AND THEN 2020 ARRIVED AND THE CORONAVIRUS STRUCK FROM CHINA. WITH THE SUPPORT OF YOUR TWO SENATORS, WE LAUNCHED THE GREATEST NATIONAL MOBILIZATION SINCE WORLD WAR I 12 AND SAW THE DELIVERY OF BILLIONS OF MEDICAL OF SUPPLIES AND CREATION OF MEDICINES AND SECURED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES AND AMAZING TO THINK IN LESS THAN A YEAR WE HAVE NOT ONE BUT TWO EFFECTTIVE VACCINES THAT ARE BEING ADMINISTERED TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND GEORGIA SENATORS WERE THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND HELPED US AND AFTER WE LOST 22 MILLION JOBS AFTER THE HEIGHT OF THIS CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS GO BACK TO WORK. WE ARE OPENING UP GEORGIA AGAIN. WE HAVE ALREADY CONFIRMED 220 FEDERAL JUDGES AT EVERY LEVEL AND THEY ARE ALL PRINCIPLED MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL ENSIDELINE OUR GOD-GIVEN CONSTITUTION. THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE PRESIDENT NOMINATES TO OUR FEDERAL COURTS BUT IT'S THE SENATE THAT CONFIRMS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT CONFIRMS. ALL THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE, NOT HAVE BEEN MADE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG UNWAVERING SUPPORT OF OUR SENATORS. THEY STOOD STRONG AND APOINTED THOSE IF I HAD JUDGES AND THEY WERE THERE WHEN WE CONFIRMED JUSTICE GORSUCH AND JUSTICE KAVANAUG HMP AND JUSTICE AMY COMB YES BARRETT. THE LAST FOUR YEARS, OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS STOOD STRONG WITH THE VALUES WE CHERISH MOST. WE REPEALED THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT BECAUSE THE FIRST AMENDMENT, FREEDOM OF SPEECH SHOULD NOT END AT THE FRONT DOOR. STOOD FOR THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY OF EVERY AMERICAN AND MADE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM A POLICY, GOALS OF OUR ADMINISTRATION ON THE WORLD STAGE. NOW YOU MAY REMEMBER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION WAS DIFFERENT. LAST ADMINISTRATION TRAMPLED ON THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES. THE COMPROMISED OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND RELIGIOUS CHARITIES. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION EVEN HAULED A GROUP OF CATHOLIC NUNS INTO FEDERAL COURT TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH TO LIVE UNDER THE FEDERAL MANDATES OF OBAMACARE. INCREDIBLE. IN FACT. WE SAW THAT RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE A FEW SHOFERT YEARS AGO WHEN JUSTICE BARRETT WENT BEFORE THE FEDERAL COURT. DO YOU REMEMBER. THE LEADING DEMOCRAT ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAID SHE WAS , [INDISCERNIBLE] [APPLAUSE] [CHANTING U.S.A.] FOR OUR LIBERTIES AND FOR OUR SENATE MAJORITY THAT WILL RESPECT OUR MOST CHERISHED FREEDOMS, WE NEED SENATOR PERDUE AND SENATOR LOEFFLER BACK IN A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY BACK IN THE U.S. SENATE. THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION HAVE NEVER BEEN MISHE AND THE CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER. WHEN THEY STAND FOR A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE, JON OSOFF AND REMPED WARN OFF ARE GOING TO CUT. WHEN OSOFF AND WARNOCK ARE GOING TO RAISE TAXES. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IT CALLING MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES GANGSTERS AND THUGS BECAUSE THEY CUT TAXES. AND REVEREND WARNOCK HAS CALLED ON OUR MOST ALLY AND WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF KELLY LOFFLER AND PERDUE, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NEVER DONE WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JUREM, THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOFFLER, THE WORLD WILL KNOW THIS, AMERICA STANDS WITH ISRAEL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WITH JON OSOFF AND RAFAEL WARN OFF, LIKE THE PARTY THEY REPUBLIC, TAXPAYER ABORTION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, I COULDN'T BE BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE ALONG SIDE THE MOST PRO-PRESIDENT. AND I AND KELLY LEFF LORE STANDS FOR THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND DAVID PERDUE. YOU KNOW WHAT THE STAKES ARE HERE IN GEORGIA. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN IN FOCUS YET, LISTEN TO WHAT CHUCK SCHUMER SAID, QUOTE, WE NOW TAKE GEORGIA AND THEN WE CHANGE AMERICA. I GOT ANOTHER MESSAGE FOR CHUCK SCHUMER. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP GEORGIA. AND WE ARE GOING TO SAVE AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I MENTIONED PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE IN GEORGIA LATER TODAY. AND I HEARD JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO HOLD A LITTLE RALLY OF HIS OWN. [LAUGHTER] JOE BIDEN WAS IN GEORGIA, YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT. HE ACTUALLY SAID THAT GEORGIA, THESE ARE HIS WORDS, GEORGIA DOESN'T NEED TWO SENATORS, QUOTE, THAT ARE JUST GOING TO GET IN THE WAY. WELL, GEORGIA, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED IN THE UNITED STATES' SENATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED THE SENATORS TO GET IN THE WAY OF THE RADICAL LEFT OF WASHINGTON D.C. WE NEED DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOFFLER TO GET IN THE WAY AND GEORGIA NEEDS TWO SENATORS THAT WILL GET IN THE WAY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND FIGHT FOR GEORGIA'S VALUES EVERY DAY. THAT'S WHY WE NEED GEORGIA TO SAY NO TO OSOFF AND WARNOCK AND SEE TO DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOFFLER TOMORROW, JANUARY 5. TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT. TO PRESERVE ALL THE PROGRESS WE MADE TO PROTECT OUR VALUES AND PROTECT OUR CHERISHED LIBERTIES. I NEED YOU TO DO A FEW THINGS. IN THE KNICKS 24 HOURS AND MORE. FIRST AND FOREMOST HELP, WE NEED YOU TO VOTE, GEORGIA. VOTE TO SAVE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLEY LOFFLER BACK TO WASHINGTON D.C.! AND I CAN TELL YOU OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN IN THE STATE AND OUR SENATORS, WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS STATE. THAT ARE WATCHING THIS FIGHT. WE ARE ON THEM AND SECURE THE POLLS AND SECURE THE DROP BOXES AND YOU GET OUT AND VOTE TOMORROW AND YOU VOTE FOR DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOFFLER AND BE CONFIDENT.

SO FOR OUR FAITH, FOR OUR FREEDOM, WE NEED TO VOTE GEORGIA, VOTE TO SAVE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLEY LEFF LORE BACK TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. I HEAR PEOPLE SAY JUST DON'T VOTE. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF GEORGIA, DID IF YOU DON'T VOTE, THEY WIN.

THE EYES ARE ON THE ELECTION OF GEORGIA. WE ARE LOOKING TO YOU. WE ARE LOOKING TO YOU GEORGIA. AND HOLD THE LINE AND I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT YOU WILL. AND LASTLY, I HAVE THAT OTHER KIND OF FAITH, TOO. THE CHALLENGING TIMES IN WHICH WE LIVE. I BELIEVE MORE THAN EVER THAT WE STAND IN THE NEED OF PRAYER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I KNOW MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE JOINING WITH YOU IN THE COURSE OF PRAYER IN THE OURS HOURS AND I WANT YOU TO ENCOURAGE PRACTICE OF PRAYER IN A RENEWED PRAYER. AS WE WORK TO DEFEND THE MAJORITY, I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO PRAY FOR THE STATE OF THIS STATE AND NATION AND PRAY WITH CONFIDENCE AND IN THOSE AINCHEPT WORDS THAT AMERICA CAPS HAVE CLUNG TO, THAT IF HIS PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLED BY HIS NAME WILL HUMBLE HIS NAME AND PRAY AND WILL DO LIKE HE HAS ALWAYS DONE IN THE LONG AND STORIED. HE WILL HEAR FROM HEAVEN AND WILL HEAL THIS LAND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO PRAY, PRAY FOR AMERICANS. PRAY FOR ALL THE AMERICANS AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME AT ROCKS SPRINGS CHURCH AND THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE TO BE YOUR VICE PRESIDENT. I WANT TO THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE. [CHANTING FOUR MORE YEARS] I LEAVE YOU TODAY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE ENTHUSIASM THAT I SEE AND I KNOW THE PRESIDENT WILL SEE THAT TODAY. BUT I CAN TELL ALL OF YOU THAT I WAS REMINDED RESENTLY EVEN WHEN IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY THAT GOOD GOD IS ALWAYS WORKING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HAVE TO TELL YOU BENNY MAY APPRECIATE THIS STORY, I SHARED IT A LITTLE WHILE BACK. I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A PASTOR WHO IS FROM JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA. HE AND HIS NEW BRIDE WERE ATTENDING A CEREMONY. AS I READ THE LETTER, HE TALKED ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE THERE. AND IT WOULD HOST A CHRISTIAN MUSIC FESTIVAL AND INVITE PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE MIDWEST TO COME. THEY WOULD HAVE BANDS THAT WOULD TAKE THE STAGE OF WHAT WAS EARLY CONTEMPORARY MUSICIC. AND DECIDED THAT THE SEE HIMARY IN 1977 TO CANCEL THE EVENT. BUT HE AND HIS NEW BRIDE SAID THEY FELT A CALLING TO VOLUNTEER TO LEAD IT AND WROTE TO ME SAYING THAT QUOTE, FRIENDS TOLD US IT WOULD BE HARD ON OUR NEW MARRIAGE AND SHOULDN'T DO A YEAR-LONG PROJECT OF SETTING UP THIS FESTIVAL AND HE SAID WE ANSWERED THE CALL. WE GATHERED OTHERS TO ARRANGE THE EVENT IN 1978. HE TOLD ME THAT THE NIGHT CAME, THE CULMINATING EVENING OF SATURDAY NIGHT WHERE HE WAS WALKING THROUGH THE CAMP AREA AND IT WAS RAINING, THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED AND THOUGHT IT WAS ALL FOR NAUTH. AND HE WROTE TO ME AND HE SAID THAT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT NIGHT, A FUTURE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE GIVING HIS LIFE TO JESUS CHRIST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE SAID, QUOTE, I CANNOT WRITE THIS WITHOUT TEARS AND I COULDN'T READ IT WITHOUT TEARS, BECAUSE I REMEMBER THAT NIGHT. SITTING ON A HILLSIDE, IT WAS RAINING AND IT WAS LIKE I HEARD THE WORDS FOR THE FIRST TIME. GOD FILL UP THE WORLD THAT HE SENT HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON MIGHT VERY ETERNAL LIFE. AND I STOOD UP, 18 YEARS YOUNG AND I WALKED DOWN THAT NIGHT, NOT OUT OF A SENSE OF NEWLY SENSE BUT MY HEART WAS WAS DONE ON THE CROSS FOR ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I TOOK A WHILE TO WRITE THAT PASTOR BACK AND WE WERE IN JACKSONVILLE A FEW MONTHS LATER. I WASN'T ABLE TO WRITE THAT LETTER WITHOUT TEARS. BUT I SAID TO HIM AT THE END, NOW I KNOW WHO ELSE TO THANK FOR THAT NIGHT SO MANY YEARS AGO. BUT THE LESSON OF HIS LETTER WAS THIS AND REASON I SHARE IT. HE SAID TO ME, MIKE, WHEN I HEARD OF THE DECISION YOU MADE THAT NIGHT, I REALIZED THAT EVEN WHEN THINGS DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY ARE GOING THE WAY THINGS EXPECTED THEY ARE GOING THE WAY HE EXPECTED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I TRULY BELIEVE ON THE EVE OF THIS GEORGIA ELECTION AND EVERY DAY FORWARD, THAT IF WE WILL HOLD FAST TO HIM, WE WILL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH THESE CHALLENGING TIMES AND RESTORE OUR NATION AND RESTORE OUR NATION AND RENEW OUR FREEDOM AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO INSPIRE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS LAND WITH OUR WITNESS WITH THE LOVE AND COMPASSION AND STRENGTH THAT COMES IN A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS CHRIST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLETS BUT WHAT HOLDS THE FUTURE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES, WINSTON CHURCHILL, IN AN ADDRESS TO CONGRESS IN 1941 AND HE SAID, QUOTE, WE MUST INDEED HAVE A BLIND SOUL WHO CANNOT SEE THE GREAT PURPOSE AND DESIGN THAT IS BEING WORKED OUT BELOW WHICH WE HAVE THE HONOR TO BE FAITHFUL SERVANTS. SO LET'S BE FAITHFUL SERVANTS AND DO OUR PART, DO OUR PART TO DO WHAT IS ALL GREAT OF THIS LAST BEST HOPE OF MANKIND. I LEAVE US TO DO ALL WHAT WE NEED TO DO ALL ACROSS THIS STATE AND ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WHEN GEORGIA STEPS UP AND HOLDS THE LINE AND DEFENDS THE MAJORITY. AND YOUR CONVICTIONS TOMORROW. WHEN YOU SEND PERDUE AND LOEFFLER TO A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT AND KEEP AMERICA GREAT THAN EVER BEFORE. THANK YOU VCH GEORGIA. GOD PLEAS YOU AND DEMROD PLEAS AMERICA.

THEY STOOD STRONG AND APOINTED THOSE IF I HAD JUDGES AND THEY WERE THERE WHEN WE CONFIRMED JUSTICE GORSUCH AND JUSTICE KAVANAUG HMP AND JUSTICE AMY COMB YES BARRETT. THE LAST FOUR YEARS, OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS STOOD STRONG WITH THE VALUES WE CHERISH MOST. WE REPEALED THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT BECAUSE THE FIRST AMENDMENT, FREEDOM OF SPEECH SHOULD NOT END AT THE FRONT DOOR. STOOD FOR THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY OF EVERY AMERICAN AND MADE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM A POLICY, GOALS OF OUR ADMINISTRATION ON THE WORLD STAGE. NOW YOU MAY REMEMBER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION WAS DIFFERENT. LAST ADMINISTRATION TRAMPLED ON THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES. THE COMPROMISED OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND RELIGIOUS CHARITIES. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION EVEN HAULED A GROUP OF CATHOLIC NUNS INTO FEDERAL COURT TO COMPROMISE THEIR FAITH TO LIVE UNDER THE FEDERAL MANDATES OF OBAMACARE. INCREDIBLE. IN FACT. WE SAW THAT RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE A FEW SHOFERT YEARS AGO WHEN JUSTICE BARRETT WENT BEFORE THE FEDERAL COURT. DO YOU REMEMBER. THE LEADING DEMOCRAT ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAID SHE WAS , FOR OUR LIBERTIES AND FOR OUR SENATE MAJORITY THAT WILL RESPECT OUR MOST CHERISHED FREEDOMS, WE NEED SENATOR PERDUE AND SENATOR LOEFFLER BACK IN A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY BACK IN THE U.S. SENATE. THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION HAVE NEVER BEEN MISHE AND THE CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER. WHEN THEY STAND FOR A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE, JON OSOFF AND REMPED WARN OFF ARE GOING TO CUT. WHEN OSOFF AND WARNOCK ARE GOING TO RAISE TAXES. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IT CALLING MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES GANGSTERS AND THUGS BECAUSE THEY CUT TAXES. AND REVEREND WARNOCK HAS CALLED ON OUR MOST ALLY AND WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF KELLY LOFFLER AND PERDUE, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NEVER DONE WHEN HE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JUREM, THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOFFLER, THE WORLD WILL KNOW THIS, AMERICA STANDS WITH ISRAEL. AND WITH JON OSOFF AND RAFAEL WARN OFF, LIKE THE PARTY THEY REPUBLIC, TAXPAYER ABORTION ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, I COULDN'T BE BE MORE PROUD TO SERVE ALONG SIDE THE MOST PRO-PRESIDENT. AND I AND KELLY LEFF LORE STANDS FOR THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND DAVID PERDUE. YOU KNOW WHAT THE STAKES ARE HERE IN GEORGIA. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN IN FOCUS YET, LISTEN TO WHAT CHUCK SCHUMER SAID, QUOTE, WE NOW TAKE GEORGIA AND THEN WE CHANGE AMERICA. I GOT ANOTHER MESSAGE FOR CHUCK SCHUMER. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP GEORGIA. AND WE ARE GOING TO SAVE AMERICA. AND I MENTIONED PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE IN GEORGIA LATER TODAY. AND I HEARD JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO HOLD A LITTLE RALLY OF HIS OWN. JOE BIDEN WAS IN GEORGIA, YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT. HE ACTUALLY SAID THAT GEORGIA, THESE ARE HIS WORDS, GEORGIA DOESN'T NEED TWO SENATORS, QUOTE, THAT ARE JUST GOING TO GET IN THE WAY. WELL, GEORGIA, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED IN THE UNITED STATES' SENATE. WE NEED THE SENATORS TO GET IN THE WAY OF THE RADICAL LEFT OF WASHINGTON D.C. WE NEED DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOFFLER TO GET IN THE WAY AND GEORGIA NEEDS TWO SENATORS THAT WILL GET IN THE WAY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND FIGHT FOR GEORGIA'S VALUES EVERY DAY. THAT'S WHY WE NEED GEORGIA TO SAY NO TO OSOFF AND WARNOCK AND SEE TO DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOFFLER TOMORROW, JANUARY 5. TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT. TO PRESERVE ALL THE PROGRESS WE MADE TO PROTECT OUR VALUES AND PROTECT OUR CHERISHED LIBERTIES. I NEED YOU TO DO A FEW THINGS. IN THE KNICKS 24 HOURS AND MORE. FIRST AND FOREMOST HELP, WE NEED YOU TO VOTE, GEORGIA. VOTE TO SAVE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLEY LOFFLER BACK TO WASHINGTON D.C.! AND I CAN TELL YOU OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN IN THE STATE AND OUR SENATORS, WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS STATE. THAT ARE WATCHING THIS FIGHT. WE ARE ON THEM AND SECURE THE POLLS AND SECURE THE DROP BOXES AND YOU GET OUT AND VOTE TOMORROW AND YOU VOTE FOR DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LOFFLER AND BE CONFIDENT. IF YOU HAVEN'T CAST YOUR VOTE, FRIENDS, CONTINUE LET FRIENDS. BRING A NEIGHBOR AND VOTE TO SEND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLEY LOEFFLER BACK TO WASHINGTON D.C. . I KNOW WE ALL GOT OUR DOUBTS WITH THE LAST ELECTION AND I WANT TO SHARE YOU, I SHARE THE CONCERNS ABOUT VOTING IRREGULARITIES. I PROMISE YOU COME THIS WEDNESDAY, WE WILL HAVE OUR DAY IN CONGRESS, WE WILL HEAR THE OBJECTIONS AND HEAR THE EVIDENCE. BUT TOMORROW IS GEORGIA'S DAY. SO FOR OUR FAITH, FOR OUR FREEDOM, WE NEED TO VOTE GEORGIA, VOTE TO SAVE DAVID PERDUE AND KELLEY LEFF LORE BACK TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. I HEAR PEOPLE SAY JUST DON'T VOTE. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF GEORGIA, DID IF YOU DON'T VOTE, THEY WIN. IF YOU DON'T VOTE, THERE COULD BE NOTHING STOPPING CHUCK SCHUMER AND NANCY PELOSI FROM CUTTING OUR MILITARY, RAISING TAXES AND PASSING THE AGENDA OF THE RADICAL LEFT. FOR ALL WE HAVE DONE AND WHAT WE HAVE YET TO DO, FOR OUR PRESIDENT, FOR OUR FAITH OR FREEDOMS AND GEORGIA, CAST ANOTHER VOTE FOR ALL PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACCOMPLISHED, SEND A VOTE TO SEND DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LEFF LORE BACK TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. WE HAVE TO HAVE GEORGIA HOLD THE LINE. WILL YOU DO IT? I BELIEVE YOU WILL. I BELIEVE YOU WILL BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH. LIKE ALL OF YOU. I HAVE FAITH IN THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE. IT IS ALL ABOUT WHAT IS GREAT OF THIS COUNTRY, FAMILY, FAITH AND FREEDOM AND YOU ARE GOING TO CAST THAT VOTE AND TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN THE POLLS CLOSE TOMORROW. THE EYES ARE ON THE ELECTION OF GEORGIA. WE ARE LOOKING TO YOU. WE ARE LOOKING TO YOU GEORGIA. AND HOLD THE LINE AND I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT YOU WILL. AND LASTLY, I HAVE THAT OTHER KIND OF FAITH, TOO. THE CHALLENGING TIMES IN WHICH WE LIVE. I BELIEVE MORE THAN EVER THAT WE STAND IN THE NEED OF PRAYER. AND I KNOW MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE JOINING WITH YOU IN THE COURSE OF PRAYER IN THE OURS HOURS AND I WANT YOU TO ENCOURAGE PRACTICE OF PRAYER IN A RENEWED PRAYER. AS WE WORK TO DEFEND THE MAJORITY, I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO PRAY FOR THE STATE OF THIS STATE AND NATION AND PRAY WITH CONFIDENCE AND IN THOSE AINCHEPT WORDS THAT AMERICA CAPS HAVE CLUNG TO, THAT IF HIS PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLED BY HIS NAME WILL HUMBLE HIS NAME AND PRAY AND WILL DO LIKE HE HAS ALWAYS DONE IN THE LONG AND STORIED. HE WILL HEAR FROM HEAVEN AND WILL HEAL THIS LAND. SO PRAY, PRAY FOR AMERICANS. PRAY FOR ALL THE AMERICANS AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME AT ROCKS SPRINGS CHURCH AND THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. IT'S THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE TO BE YOUR VICE PRESIDENT. I WANT TO THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE. I LEAVE YOU TODAY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE ENTHUSIASM THAT I SEE AND I KNOW THE PRESIDENT WILL SEE THAT TODAY. BUT I CAN TELL ALL OF YOU THAT I WAS REMINDED RESENTLY EVEN WHEN IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY THAT GOOD GOD IS ALWAYS WORKING. I HAVE TO TELL YOU BENNY MAY APPRECIATE THIS STORY, I SHARED IT A LITTLE WHILE BACK. I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A PASTOR WHO IS FROM JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA. HE AND HIS NEW BRIDE WERE ATTENDING A CEREMONY. AS I READ THE LETTER, HE TALKED ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE THERE. AND IT WOULD HOST A CHRISTIAN MUSIC FESTIVAL AND INVITE PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE MIDWEST TO COME. THEY WOULD HAVE BANDS THAT WOULD TAKE THE STAGE OF WHAT WAS EARLY CONTEMPORARY MUSICIC. AND DECIDED THAT THE SEE HIMARY IN 1977 TO CANCEL THE EVENT. BUT HE AND HIS NEW BRIDE SAID THEY FELT A CALLING TO VOLUNTEER TO LEAD IT AND WROTE TO ME SAYING THAT QUOTE, FRIENDS TOLD US IT WOULD BE HARD ON OUR NEW MARRIAGE AND SHOULDN'T DO A YEAR-LONG PROJECT OF SETTING UP THIS FESTIVAL AND HE SAID WE ANSWERED THE CALL. WE GATHERED OTHERS TO ARRANGE THE EVENT IN 1978. HE TOLD ME THAT THE NIGHT CAME, THE CULMINATING EVENING OF SATURDAY NIGHT WHERE HE WAS WALKING THROUGH THE CAMP AREA AND IT WAS RAINING, THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED AND THOUGHT IT WAS ALL FOR NAUTH. AND HE WROTE TO ME AND HE SAID THAT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT NIGHT, A FUTURE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE GIVING HIS LIFE TO JESUS CHRIST. HE SAID, QUOTE, I CANNOT WRITE THIS WITHOUT TEARS AND I COULDN'T READ IT WITHOUT TEARS, BECAUSE I REMEMBER THAT NIGHT. SITTING ON A HILLSIDE, IT WAS RAINING AND IT WAS LIKE I HEARD THE WORDS FOR THE FIRST TIME. GOD FILL UP THE WORLD THAT HE SENT HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON MIGHT VERY ETERNAL LIFE. AND I STOOD UP, 18 YEARS YOUNG AND I WALKED DOWN THAT NIGHT, NOT OUT OF A SENSE OF NEWLY SENSE BUT MY HEART WAS WAS DONE ON THE CROSS FOR ME. I TOOK A WHILE TO WRITE THAT PASTOR BACK AND WE WERE IN JACKSONVILLE A FEW MONTHS LATER. I WASN'T ABLE TO WRITE THAT LETTER WITHOUT TEARS. BUT I SAID TO HIM AT THE END, NOW I KNOW WHO ELSE TO THANK FOR THAT NIGHT SO MANY YEARS AGO. BUT THE LESSON OF HIS LETTER WAS THIS AND REASON I SHARE IT. HE SAID TO ME, MIKE, WHEN I HEARD OF THE DECISION YOU MADE THAT NIGHT, I REALIZED THAT EVEN WHEN THINGS DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY ARE GOING THE WAY THINGS EXPECTED THEY ARE GOING THE WAY HE EXPECTED. I TRULY BELIEVE ON THE EVE OF THIS GEORGIA ELECTION AND EVERY DAY FORWARD, THAT IF WE WILL HOLD FAST TO HIM, WE WILL SEE OUR WAY THROUGH THESE CHALLENGING TIMES AND RESTORE OUR NATION AND RESTORE OUR NATION AND RENEW OUR FREEDOM AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO INSPIRE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS LAND WITH OUR WITNESS WITH THE LOVE AND COMPASSION AND STRENGTH THAT COMES IN A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS CHRIST. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLETS BUT WHAT HOLDS THE FUTURE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES, WINSTON CHURCHILL, IN AN ADDRESS TO CONGRESS IN 1941 AND HE SAID, QUOTE, WE MUST INDEED HAVE A BLIND SOUL WHO CANNOT SEE THE GREAT PURPOSE AND DESIGN THAT IS BEING WORKED OUT BELOW WHICH WE HAVE THE HONOR TO BE FAITHFUL SERVANTS. SO LET'S BE FAITHFUL SERVANTS AND DO OUR PART, DO OUR PART TO DO WHAT IS ALL GREAT OF THIS LAST BEST HOPE OF MANKIND. I LEAVE US TO DO ALL WHAT WE NEED TO DO ALL ACROSS THIS STATE AND ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WHEN GEORGIA STEPS UP AND HOLDS THE LINE AND DEFENDS THE MAJORITY. AND YOUR CONVICTIONS TOMORROW. WHEN YOU SEND PERDUE AND LOEFFLER TO A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT AND KEEP AMERICA GREAT THAN EVER BEFORE. THANK YOU VCH GEORGIA. GOD PLEAS YOU AND DEMROD PLEAS AMERICA. NOW LET'S GET IT DONE!	https://www.c-span.org/video/?507700-1/vice-president-pence-remarks-georgia-senate-campaign-event	"Vice President Pence campaigned for incumbent Republican Georgia U.S. Senate candidates, Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Both candidates were facing runoff elections with Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock on January 5, 2021. The runoff would determine majority control of the U.S. Senate. Vice President Pence talked about the importance of Georgians voting and said he shares the concerns of some Americans about voting irregularities. The vice president told the crowd that ""come this Wednesday, we&rsquo;ll have our day in Congress. We&rsquo;ll hear the objections. We&rsquo;ll hear the evidence, but tomorrow is Georgia&rsquo;s day""."	507700-1		
CSPANMP1612021186	Mike Pence	2021-01-16	Vice President Pence Remarks on Trump Administration Foreign Policy Achievements	Speech	I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS RELEVANT TO THE DISCUSSION. THE ONE THING I HOPE WE DO NOT DO IS WE SEE THIS AS A MONOLITHIC ISSUE OR EVENT OR MOVEMENT, BECAUSE THERE ARE DEEP STRAINS OF DIFFERENT THINGS, WHETHER IT IS WHITE SUPREMACY, ANTI-IMMIGRATION, TAKING OVER THE GOVERNMENT, BUT I THINK WE'VE MADE THIS MISTAKE WHEN WE DEALT WITH ISLAMIC TERRORISM ON A NUMBER OF LEVELS, BECAUSE THERE ARE ORGANIZED GROUPS THAT YOU CAN LABEL UNDER THAT VERY BROAD CATEGORY, BUT ALL OF THESE TERRORIST GROUPS HAD VERY DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES. AS PAULA HAD A VERY , HEZBOLLAH HAD A VERY DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES THAN AL QAEDA OR THE TALIBAN. AND THAT IS SO IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FROM AN OPERATIONAL LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT KILLING PEOPLE, BUT WHEN YOU WEREN'T LOOKING AT HOW DO YOU ADDRESS IT FROM AN IDEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE, OR HOW ARE YOU GOING TO COUNTER THE NARRATIVE OR FRAME THIS SO THAT THE MOVEMENTS AND THAT EXPAND. IF WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE GROUPS THEMSELVES AND THEIR PARTICULAR UNITS OR GROUP AND WE JUST TRY TO WRAP IT ALL AND RUN , IN ONE WE FAIL IN DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN LEMOORE. WE WERE HERE IN JULY OF 2019. WE ARE EXCITED TO BE HERE TO SEE YOU ALL TODAY. WE LOVE SEEING THESE PLANES, TOO. OUR SON FLIES THE F-35. OUR SON-IN-LAW FLIES THE SUPER HORNETS. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE TODAY. IT IS EXCITING FOR US. THIS IS REALLY OUR LAST OFFICIAL TRIP AS VICE PRESIDENT AND SECOND LADY. THERE IS NO WHERE WE WOULD RATHER BE THAN RIGHT HERE AT LEMOORE. TODAY, I GET TO INTRODUCE THE VICE PRESIDENT. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT HE AND I ARE SO PROUD OF YOUR SERVICE. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF HANDING OVER , HEADING OVER TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE SPOUSES AND TELLING THEM HOW PROUD WE ARE OF THEM. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SACRIFICE. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SPOUSES AND SACRIFICES OF YOUR CHILDREN, YOUR FAMILY. WE KNOW THAT YOU SERVE TOGETHER. WE UNDERSTAND THAT AT OUR HOUSE. WE HAVE THAT GOING ON, AS WELL. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. PLEASE TELL YOUR SPOUSES AND YOUR FAMILY, YOUR PARENTS, YOUR CHILDREN, HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE FOR YOUR SERVICE. WE HAVE MADE IT A PRIORITY OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO MAKE THE MILITARY ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES TO LET YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE CARE ABOUT YOU. [APPLAUSE] SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE. NOW IT IS TIME TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MIKE PENCE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. HELLO, LEMOORE. [APPLAUSE] THE CAPTAIN, DOUG PETERSON, CAPTAIN AIDEN JASON, CAPTAIN BOBBY MARK A VAGUE. ALL OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES GATHERED HERE, HONORED GUESTS. THANKS FOR THE WARM WELCOME. THANKS FOR THE FLIGHT JACKET. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH THE SAILORS AT THE NAVY'S WEST COAST MASTER JET BASE NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE. [APPLAUSE] AS MY WONDERFUL WIFE SAID, IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN STRIKE FIGHTER COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] BEFORE I BEGIN, I WANT TO ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN THANKING SOMEONE WHO HAS LITERALLY SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS SHOWING OUR APPRECIATION FOR PEOPLE LIKE THIS. [LAUGHTER] VICE PRES. PENCE: THAT'S GREAT. SHE IS A MARINE CORPS MOM. SHE HAS TRAVELED THE NATION AND TRAVELED THE WORLD, COMING ALONGSIDE MILITARY SPOUSES. SHE SUPPORTED REFORMS AND LAWS CONCERNING AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING MILITARY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT. SHE WILL BE SPEAKING TO SPOUSES RIGHT HERE. AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF MY INCREDIBLE WIFE, WHO I THINK IS THE BEST SECOND LADY THE U.S. HAS EVER HAD. JOIN ME IN THANKING KAREN PENCE WHAT SHE HAS DONE FOR OUR TROOPS AND FAMILIES. THANK YOU. VICE PRES. PENCE: I'M HERE TO DELIVER A VERY SIMPLE MESSAGE. TO EACH AND EVERYONE ONE OF YOU. ON BEHALF OF YOUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, FROM YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, AND BEHALF OF EVERY AMERICAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AFTER TRAVELING ACROSS THIS COUNTRY FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS, I PROMISE YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE MORE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE THEN YOU WILL EVER KNOW. YOU COME FROM THE REST OF US, BUT WE KNOW, YOU ARE THE BEST OF US. AND WE ARE GRATEFUL. NOT ONLY TO THOSE OF YOU WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM, BUT AS WE HAVE MENTIONED A FEW MOMENTS ALREADY, WE ARE GRATEFUL TO ALL WHO STAND BESIDE YOU. SO MANY OF YOU SERVE EVERYDAY AS A FAMILY. WHILE YOU TRAIN AND DEPLOY, YOUR WIVES, YOUR HUSBANDS, THE PARENTS WHO KEEP THE HOME FIRES BURNING, ISN'T IT? WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OUR DAUGHTER, CHARLOTTE, AND OUR SON-IN-LAW ARE STATIONED RIGHT HERE AT NAS LEMOORE. WE COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD. OUR SON IS A MARINE CORPS F-35 PILOT. HE AND HIS WIFE ARE STATIONED IN ARIZONA. LIKE SO MANY OF YOU, THEY SERVE AS A FAMILY. AS WE EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE MEN AND WOMEN GATHERED BEFORE ME, AND ALL YOU REPRESENT, HOW ABOUT A BIGGER ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR ALL OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO SUPPORT ALL OF YOU WHO SERVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN UNIFORM? LET'S HEAR IT. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: IT IS INSPIRING TO LOOK OUT AND SEE ALL OF YOU TODAY. REMARKABLE TO THINK OF THE COUNTLESS AMERICAN HEROES WHO HAVE STOOD WHERE WE ARE ALL STANDING. OVER 60 YEARS, WARRIORS HAVE COME HERE, TRAINED HERE, GONE OUT FROM HERE AND DEPLOYED TO EVERY PLACE IN EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD. THIS INSTALLATION IS THE ONLY MASTER JET BASE OF THE NAVY, AND ALL OPERATIONAL, SPECIFICALLY STRIKE FIGHTER SQUADRONS. 16 OPERATIONAL STRIKE FIGHTER SQUADRONS, TWO FLEET REPLACEMENT SQUADRONS, ONE WEST COAST CARRIER AIR WING, COMMANDERS, AND STAFF. ON AVERAGE, MORE THAN 210,000 FLIGHT OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED RIGHT HERE FROM NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE EVERY YEAR. GIVE YOURSELVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE HISTORY AND TRADITION OF SERVICE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: TWO AIR WINGS ARE CURRENTLY DEPLOYED, 11 ON THE USS TEDDY, NINE SQUADRONS, INCLUDING THE BLACK DIAMOND AND THE KNIGHTS STATIONED HERE. CARRIER AIR WING 17 IS DEPLOYED FOR THE NIMITZ. IT INCLUDES NINE SQUADRONS, INCLUDING F-18 SUPER HORNETS FROM HERE AT LEMOORE, FLOWN BY THE RED CROSS, THE CASTRO'S, AND THE MIGHTY STRIKES. HOW ABOUT A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR ALL OF THE NAS LEMOORE SQUADRONS DEPLOYED AROUND THE WORLD? WE ARE PROUD OF YOU ALL. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE SOAR ACROSS THE SKY IN DEFENSE OF OUR NATION AND FREEDOM. IT INSPIRES EVERY DAY. MANY PEOPLE WONDER ALL THEIR LIVES IF THEY HAVE EVER MADE A DIFFERENCE. YOU WILL NEVER HAVE THAT PROBLEM. YOU STEP FORWARD, JOIN THE ARMED FORCES, YOU BECAME PART OF THE GREATEST FORCE FOR GOOD THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN. YOU CHOSE TO DO YOUR PART IN YOUR TIME TO DEFEND THE FLAME OF FREEDOM AND HAND IT ON TO GENERATIONS YET TO COME. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GRATEFUL. THE BIBLE SAYS YOU DID NOT LOVE YOUR LIVES SO MUCH AS TO SHRINK FROM THIS CALLING. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU, YOU HAVE OUR DEEPEST RESPECTS FOR THE SELFLESSNESS AND COURAGE YOU PERSONIFY EVERY DAY. FOR FOUR YEARS, I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF BEING VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE WORKED EVERY DAY TO MAKE THE STRONGEST MILITARY FORCE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD STRONGER STILL. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT BY DEVASTATING BUDGET CUTS. . OUR TROOPS HADN'T SEEN A SIGNIFICANT PAY RAISE IN NEARLY 10 YEARS. ALMIRA TERRI , OUR MILITARY LACKED READINESS. OUR NATO ALLIES WERE NOT MEETING THEIR COMMITMENTS TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE. IRAN WAS RESURGENT ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION CONTROLLED A LANDMASS THE SIZE OF PENNSYLVANIA. I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE RESTORED THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE ENACTED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: WE ARE ONCE AGAIN GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, COAST GUARD, AND GUARDIANS OF THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT YOU DESERVE. WE PROVIDED FOR ACTIVE-DUTY PERSONNEL, THE LARGEST PAY RAISE IN NEARLY 10 YEARS, AND YOU DESERVE EVERY PENNY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: OUR MILITARY IS NOW MORE EQUIPPED THAN EVER BEFORE. UNDER OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE SECURED NEARLY 500 F-35 FIGHTERS, 21 MORE DEPLOYABLE SHIPS, WITH ANOTHER 59 ON THE WAY. WE HAVE UPGRADED OUR TANKS, ARTILLERY, ROCKET SYSTEMS, BOLSTERED OUR FLEET OF ATTACK HELICOPTERS AND BROADER FIGHTER PLANES, AS WELL. WITH THAT STRONG COMMITMENT TO OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE, AND WILLINGNESS TO USE AMERICAN POWER TO ADVANCE AMERICAN SECURITY, OUR ALLIES HAVE ALSO STEPPED UP AS NEVER BEFORE. SINCE 2016, OUR NATO ALLIES HAVE INCREASED THEIR CONCH TRIBUTE , CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE BY MORE THAN $130 BILLION. HISTORY TEACHES WEAKNESS COMES OUT OF PEOPLE, AND OUR HISTORY HAS PROVEN A STRONG AMERICA DETERS IT. OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IF YOU WANT PEACE, PREPARE FOR WAR. WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE HAVE DEFENDED THIS NATION AND AMERICA'S VITAL INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS AND AROUND THE WORLD. WITH A FEW DAYS LEFT, I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION IN DECADES NOT TO GET AMERICA INTO A NEW WAR. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: BUT ALL ALONG THE WAY WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AND STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES. WE INSURED PEACE AND STABILITY. IT REQUIRES TWO THINGS, STRONG AMERICAN MILITARY AND WILLINGNESS TO ACT TO DEFEND AMERICA'S INTERESTS AROUND THE WORLD. UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE DONE JUST THAT. WE TOOK HISTORIC STEPS, FIRST TO STAND WITH OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLIES. WE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, THE CAPITOL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. WE RECOGNIZE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY OVER GOLAN HEIGHTS. AND AFTER 26 YEARS, FOUR ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST. AND UNDER OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE TAKEN THE FIGHT TO RADICAL ISLAM IT TERRORISTS ON OUR TERMS ON THEIR SOIL. DURING THESE LAST FOUR YEARS, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE U.S. CAPTURED THE LAST INCH OF TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY ISIS, AND A STRIKE FIGHTERS STATIONED RIGHT HERE AT NAS LEMOORE WERE IN THE FIGHT EARLY ON, HITTING ISIS, GIVING TERRORISTS NO QUARTER, DRIVING THEM FROM THEIR STRONGHOLDS. WITH THE COURAGE OF OUR ARMED FORCES, I'M PROUD TO REPORT MORE THAN A YEAR AGO, WE CRUSHED THEIR CALIPHATE, CAPTURED THE LAST INCH OF TERRITORY UNDER THE BLACK FLAG OF ISIS, AND TOOK DOWN THEIR LEADER WITHOUT ONE AMERICAN CASUALTY. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: AND WE STOOD UP TO THE LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR. DRAWING FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, WE STRENGTHENED OUR ALLIANCES IN THE REGION AND ISOLATED IRAN AS NEVER BEFORE. AND WHEN THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD THREATENED AMERICAN FORCES IN THE REGION, OUR ARMED FORCES TOOK ACTION AND IRAN'S TOP GENERAL, BECAUSE SOME SOLEIMANI, IS GONE. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: THANKS TO AMERICAN LEADERSHIP, A MORE PEACEFUL MIDDLE EAST IS WITHIN OUR SITES. AND WITH RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE EMBRACE OUR ROLE AS LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. WHETHER IT BE IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR OR MANNING THE RAMPARTS OF FREEDOM IN EUROPE, OR THE ASIA-PACIFIC, THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE U.S. NAVY HAVE BEEN THAT GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. A STRONG AND READY NAVY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. AS A NEW AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION PREPARES TO TAKE OFFICE, WE DO WELL TO REMEMBER AS AMERICANS THAT THE PRICE OF FREEDOM IS ETERNAL VIGILANCE, AND A FREE AND OPEN INDO PACIFIC IS IMPORTANT TO OUR PROSPERITY, SECURITY, AND VITALITY OF FREEDOM OF US THE WORLD. AFTER GENERATIONS WHERE AMERICA AND OUR ALLIES DEFENDED THE FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION AND THE INTERESTS OF FREE NATIONS ACROSS THE ASIA-PACIFIC, TODAY, THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS DETERMINED TO EXPAND BEIJING'S INFLUENCE ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH MILITARY PROVOCATIONS AND DEAD DIPLOMACY. SO I URGE THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION TO STAY THE COURSE. DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE. STAND UP TO CHINESE AGGRESSION, AND TRADE ABUSES. STAND STRONG FOR A FREE AND OPEN INDO PACIFIC AND PUT AMERICA AND OUR FREEDOM LOVING ALLIES FIRST. [APPLAUSE] VICE PRES. PENCE: AND I KNOW THE U.S. NAVY WILL CONTINUE TO STAND STRONG. IN THE INDO PACIFIC AND ALL OVER THE WORLD. IN THE YEARS AHEAD, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE FREE WORLD WILL RELY ON THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. NAVY MORE THAN EVER TO SAFEGUARD THE FREE AND OPEN FLOW OF COMMERCE AND OUR IDEALS ON THE SEVEN SEAS. SO ON BEHALF OF YOUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, LET ME OFFER YOU THIS ADMONITION. IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES ACROSS THE WIDER WORLD, BE VIGILANT. MIND YOUR MISSION. RESPECT THE UNIFIED CHAIN OF COMMAND. TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. NEVER DOUBT THAT EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE, EVERY ACTION YOU TAKE, MATTERS TO THE SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. GIVE AMERICA YOUR BEST EVERY DAY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON YOU. BECAUSE WE KNOW WE CAN. AS YOU STAND AT POST, I CAN ASSURE YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE BEHIND YOU 100%. SO AS I CLOSE, LET ME SAY AGAIN, ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY AND A GRATEFUL NATION, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AMERICA IS THE FREEST AND STRONGEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND YOU SECURE THAT FREEDOM. AND YOU ARE THAT STRENGTH. YOU STEP FORWARD IN A CALLING WERE YOU DECIDED TO COUNT OUR LIVES AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR OWN. JUST LIKE GENERATIONS THAT HAVE GONE BEFORE, YOU DID SO KNOWING THE SAILOR AND THE SOLDIER DO NOT BEAR THE SWORD IN VAIN. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE RISK YOU TAKE EVERY DAY. BUT KNOW THIS. YOU DO NOT BEAR THAT BURDEN ALONE. WHEREVER YOU ARE CALLED TO SERVE, WHEREVER YOU ARE DEPLOYED, I PROMISE YOU, YOU WILL CARRY WITH YOU THE STRENGTH AND PRIDE OF THIS NATION, AND THE PRAYERS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. THERE WILL PRAY IN THE ANCIENT WORDS OF THE PSALMISTS THAT NO HARM WILL BEFORE YOU, NO DISASTER WILL COME NEAR YOUR TENT, THAT AS YOU SERVE HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD, THAT HIS FAITHFULNESS WILL BE YOUR SHIELD. YOU ARE THE STRENGTH AND THE PRIDE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND A SOURCE OF GREAT PRIDE TO OUR FAMILY. AND WHETHER YOU SERVE ON LAND, AT SEA, OR IN THE SKIES ABOVE, JUST KNOW THAT EVERY DAY, IN HOMES LARGE AND SMALL AROUND DINNER TABLES AND GATHERINGS, AND IN QUIET MOMENTS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PRAY FOR EACH AND EVERYONE. GIVE THANKS FOR YOUR SELFLESS COURAGE, AND WISH YOU FARIR WINDS AND FOLLOWING SEAS. THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING WITH YOU TODAY. AS MY TIME IN OFFICE DRAWS TO A CLOSE, ALLOW ME TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT THESE PAST FOUR YEARS. IT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE. AND IT HAS BEEN A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE TO SERVE MEN AND WOMEN LIKE ALL OF YOU, MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES. I TRULY BELIEVE AS LONG AS WE HAVE MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU, WITH THE COURAGE AND SELFLESSNESS TO STEP FORWARD AND SERVE, AS LONG AS WE HAVE HEROES WILLING TO PUT YOUR LIVES ON THE LINE, AS LONG AS WE HAVE PATRIOTS WILLING TO DEFEND OUR NATION, I KNOW OUR COUNTRY WILL BE SAFE. OUR FREEDOM WILL BE SECURE, AND THE BEST DAYS FOR THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH ARE YET TO COME. SO MAY GOD BLESS THE MEN AND WOMEN OF NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE HERE AND DEPLOYED. GOD BLESS YOU AND HIS PROTECTION, AND WITH THAT FIGHTER SPIRIT. MAY GOD BLESS ALL THOSE SERVING IN OUR ARMED FORCES. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.

HELLO, LEMOORE. THE CAPTAIN, DOUG PETERSON, CAPTAIN AIDEN JASON, CAPTAIN BOBBY MARK A VAGUE. ALL OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES GATHERED HERE, HONORED GUESTS. THANKS FOR THE WARM WELCOME. THANKS FOR THE FLIGHT JACKET. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH THE SAILORS AT THE NAVY'S WEST COAST MASTER JET BASE NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE. AS MY WONDERFUL WIFE SAID, IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN STRIKE FIGHTER COUNTRY. BEFORE I BEGIN, I WANT TO ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN THANKING SOMEONE WHO HAS LITERALLY SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS SHOWING OUR APPRECIATION FOR PEOPLE LIKE THIS. THAT'S GREAT. SHE IS A MARINE CORPS MOM. SHE HAS TRAVELED THE NATION AND TRAVELED THE WORLD, COMING ALONGSIDE MILITARY SPOUSES. SHE SUPPORTED REFORMS AND LAWS CONCERNING AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING MILITARY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT. SHE WILL BE SPEAKING TO SPOUSES RIGHT HERE. AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF MY INCREDIBLE WIFE, WHO I THINK IS THE BEST SECOND LADY THE U.S. HAS EVER HAD. JOIN ME IN THANKING KAREN PENCE WHAT SHE HAS DONE FOR OUR TROOPS AND FAMILIES. THANK YOU. I'M HERE TO DELIVER A VERY SIMPLE MESSAGE. TO EACH AND EVERYONE ONE OF YOU. ON BEHALF OF YOUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, FROM YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, AND BEHALF OF EVERY AMERICAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AFTER TRAVELING ACROSS THIS COUNTRY FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS, I PROMISE YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE MORE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE THEN YOU WILL EVER KNOW. YOU COME FROM THE REST OF US, BUT WE KNOW, YOU ARE THE BEST OF US. AND WE ARE GRATEFUL. NOT ONLY TO THOSE OF YOU WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM, BUT AS WE HAVE MENTIONED A FEW MOMENTS ALREADY, WE ARE GRATEFUL TO ALL WHO STAND BESIDE YOU. SO MANY OF YOU SERVE EVERYDAY AS A FAMILY. WHILE YOU TRAIN AND DEPLOY, YOUR WIVES, YOUR HUSBANDS, THE PARENTS WHO KEEP THE HOME FIRES BURNING, ISN'T IT? WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OUR DAUGHTER, CHARLOTTE, AND OUR SON-IN-LAW ARE STATIONED RIGHT HERE AT NAS LEMOORE. WE COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD. OUR SON IS A MARINE CORPS F-35 PILOT. HE AND HIS WIFE ARE STATIONED IN ARIZONA. LIKE SO MANY OF YOU, THEY SERVE AS A FAMILY. AS WE EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE MEN AND WOMEN GATHERED BEFORE ME, AND ALL YOU REPRESENT, HOW ABOUT A BIGGER ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR ALL OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO SUPPORT ALL OF YOU WHO SERVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN UNIFORM? LET'S HEAR IT. IT IS INSPIRING TO LOOK OUT AND SEE ALL OF YOU TODAY. REMARKABLE TO THINK OF THE COUNTLESS AMERICAN HEROES WHO HAVE STOOD WHERE WE ARE ALL STANDING. OVER 60 YEARS, WARRIORS HAVE COME HERE, TRAINED HERE, GONE OUT FROM HERE AND DEPLOYED TO EVERY PLACE IN EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD. THIS INSTALLATION IS THE ONLY MASTER JET BASE OF THE NAVY, AND ALL OPERATIONAL, SPECIFICALLY STRIKE FIGHTER SQUADRONS. 16 OPERATIONAL STRIKE FIGHTER SQUADRONS, TWO FLEET REPLACEMENT SQUADRONS, ONE WEST COAST CARRIER AIR WING, COMMANDERS, AND STAFF. ON AVERAGE, MORE THAN 210,000 FLIGHT OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED RIGHT HERE FROM NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE EVERY YEAR. GIVE YOURSELVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE HISTORY AND TRADITION OF SERVICE. TWO AIR WINGS ARE CURRENTLY DEPLOYED, 11 ON THE USS TEDDY, NINE SQUADRONS, INCLUDING THE BLACK DIAMOND AND THE KNIGHTS STATIONED HERE. CARRIER AIR WING 17 IS DEPLOYED FOR THE NIMITZ. IT INCLUDES NINE SQUADRONS, INCLUDING F-18 SUPER HORNETS FROM HERE AT LEMOORE, FLOWN BY THE RED CROSS, THE CASTRO'S, AND THE MIGHTY STRIKES. HOW ABOUT A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR ALL OF THE NAS LEMOORE SQUADRONS DEPLOYED AROUND THE WORLD? WE ARE PROUD OF YOU ALL. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE SOAR ACROSS THE SKY IN DEFENSE OF OUR NATION AND FREEDOM. IT INSPIRES EVERY DAY. MANY PEOPLE WONDER ALL THEIR LIVES IF THEY HAVE EVER MADE A DIFFERENCE. YOU WILL NEVER HAVE THAT PROBLEM. YOU STEP FORWARD, JOIN THE ARMED FORCES, YOU BECAME PART OF THE GREATEST FORCE FOR GOOD THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN. YOU CHOSE TO DO YOUR PART IN YOUR TIME TO DEFEND THE FLAME OF FREEDOM AND HAND IT ON TO GENERATIONS YET TO COME. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GRATEFUL. THE BIBLE SAYS YOU DID NOT LOVE YOUR LIVES SO MUCH AS TO SHRINK FROM THIS CALLING. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU, YOU HAVE OUR DEEPEST RESPECTS FOR THE SELFLESSNESS AND COURAGE YOU PERSONIFY EVERY DAY. FOR FOUR YEARS, I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF BEING VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE WORKED EVERY DAY TO MAKE THE STRONGEST MILITARY FORCE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD STRONGER STILL. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT BY DEVASTATING BUDGET CUTS. . OUR TROOPS HADN'T SEEN A SIGNIFICANT PAY RAISE IN NEARLY 10 YEARS. ALMIRA TERRI , OUR MILITARY LACKED READINESS. OUR NATO ALLIES WERE NOT MEETING THEIR COMMITMENTS TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE. IRAN WAS RESURGENT ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION CONTROLLED A LANDMASS THE SIZE OF PENNSYLVANIA. I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE RESTORED THE ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE ENACTED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. WE ARE ONCE AGAIN GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, COAST GUARD, AND GUARDIANS OF THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT YOU DESERVE. WE PROVIDED FOR ACTIVE-DUTY PERSONNEL, THE LARGEST PAY RAISE IN NEARLY 10 YEARS, AND YOU DESERVE EVERY PENNY. OUR MILITARY IS NOW MORE EQUIPPED THAN EVER BEFORE. UNDER OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE SECURED NEARLY 500 F-35 FIGHTERS, 21 MORE DEPLOYABLE SHIPS, WITH ANOTHER 59 ON THE WAY. WE HAVE UPGRADED OUR TANKS, ARTILLERY, ROCKET SYSTEMS, BOLSTERED OUR FLEET OF ATTACK HELICOPTERS AND BROADER FIGHTER PLANES, AS WELL. WITH THAT STRONG COMMITMENT TO OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE, AND WILLINGNESS TO USE AMERICAN POWER TO ADVANCE AMERICAN SECURITY, OUR ALLIES HAVE ALSO STEPPED UP AS NEVER BEFORE. SINCE 2016, OUR NATO ALLIES HAVE INCREASED THEIR CONCH TRIBUTE , CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE BY MORE THAN $130 BILLION. HISTORY TEACHES WEAKNESS COMES OUT OF PEOPLE, AND OUR HISTORY HAS PROVEN A STRONG AMERICA DETERS IT. OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IF YOU WANT PEACE, PREPARE FOR WAR. WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE HAVE DEFENDED THIS NATION AND AMERICA'S VITAL INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS AND AROUND THE WORLD. WITH A FEW DAYS LEFT, I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION IN DECADES NOT TO GET AMERICA INTO A NEW WAR. BUT ALL ALONG THE WAY WITH THAT RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE STOOD WITH OUR ALLIES AND STOOD UP TO OUR ENEMIES. WE INSURED PEACE AND STABILITY. IT REQUIRES TWO THINGS, STRONG AMERICAN MILITARY AND WILLINGNESS TO ACT TO DEFEND AMERICA'S INTERESTS AROUND THE WORLD. UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE DONE JUST THAT. WE TOOK HISTORIC STEPS, FIRST TO STAND WITH OUR MOST CHERISHED ALLIES. WE MOVED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM, THE CAPITOL OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. WE RECOGNIZE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY OVER GOLAN HEIGHTS. AND AFTER 26 YEARS, FOUR ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST. AND UNDER OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE TAKEN THE FIGHT TO RADICAL ISLAM IT TERRORISTS ON OUR TERMS ON THEIR SOIL. DURING THESE LAST FOUR YEARS, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE U.S. CAPTURED THE LAST INCH OF TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY ISIS, AND A STRIKE FIGHTERS STATIONED RIGHT HERE AT NAS LEMOORE WERE IN THE FIGHT EARLY ON, HITTING ISIS, GIVING TERRORISTS NO QUARTER, DRIVING THEM FROM THEIR STRONGHOLDS. WITH THE COURAGE OF OUR ARMED FORCES, I'M PROUD TO REPORT MORE THAN A YEAR AGO, WE CRUSHED THEIR CALIPHATE, CAPTURED THE LAST INCH OF TERRITORY UNDER THE BLACK FLAG OF ISIS, AND TOOK DOWN THEIR LEADER WITHOUT ONE AMERICAN CASUALTY. AND WE STOOD UP TO THE LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR. DRAWING FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, WE STRENGTHENED OUR ALLIANCES IN THE REGION AND ISOLATED IRAN AS NEVER BEFORE. AND WHEN THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD THREATENED AMERICAN FORCES IN THE REGION, OUR ARMED FORCES TOOK ACTION AND IRAN'S TOP GENERAL, BECAUSE SOME SOLEIMANI, IS GONE. THANKS TO AMERICAN LEADERSHIP, A MORE PEACEFUL MIDDLE EAST IS WITHIN OUR SITES. AND WITH RENEWED AMERICAN STRENGTH, WE EMBRACE OUR ROLE AS LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. WHETHER IT BE IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR OR MANNING THE RAMPARTS OF FREEDOM IN EUROPE, OR THE ASIA-PACIFIC, THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE U.S. NAVY HAVE BEEN THAT GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. A STRONG AND READY NAVY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. AS A NEW AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION PREPARES TO TAKE OFFICE, WE DO WELL TO REMEMBER AS AMERICANS THAT THE PRICE OF FREEDOM IS ETERNAL VIGILANCE, AND A FREE AND OPEN INDO PACIFIC IS IMPORTANT TO OUR PROSPERITY, SECURITY, AND VITALITY OF FREEDOM OF US THE WORLD. AFTER GENERATIONS WHERE AMERICA AND OUR ALLIES DEFENDED THE FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION AND THE INTERESTS OF FREE NATIONS ACROSS THE ASIA-PACIFIC, TODAY, THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS DETERMINED TO EXPAND BEIJING'S INFLUENCE ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH MILITARY PROVOCATIONS AND DEAD DIPLOMACY. SO I URGE THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION TO STAY THE COURSE. DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE. STAND UP TO CHINESE AGGRESSION, AND TRADE ABUSES. STAND STRONG FOR A FREE AND OPEN INDO PACIFIC AND PUT AMERICA AND OUR FREEDOM LOVING ALLIES FIRST. AND I KNOW THE U.S. NAVY WILL CONTINUE TO STAND STRONG. IN THE INDO PACIFIC AND ALL OVER THE WORLD. IN THE YEARS AHEAD, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE FREE WORLD WILL RELY ON THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. NAVY MORE THAN EVER TO SAFEGUARD THE FREE AND OPEN FLOW OF COMMERCE AND OUR IDEALS ON THE SEVEN SEAS. SO ON BEHALF OF YOUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, LET ME OFFER YOU THIS ADMONITION. IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES ACROSS THE WIDER WORLD, BE VIGILANT. MIND YOUR MISSION. RESPECT THE UNIFIED CHAIN OF COMMAND. TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. NEVER DOUBT THAT EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE, EVERY ACTION YOU TAKE, MATTERS TO THE SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. GIVE AMERICA YOUR BEST EVERY DAY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON YOU. BECAUSE WE KNOW WE CAN. AS YOU STAND AT POST, I CAN ASSURE YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE BEHIND YOU 100%. SO AS I CLOSE, LET ME SAY AGAIN, ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY AND A GRATEFUL NATION, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AMERICA IS THE FREEST AND STRONGEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND YOU SECURE THAT FREEDOM. AND YOU ARE THAT STRENGTH. YOU STEP FORWARD IN A CALLING WERE YOU DECIDED TO COUNT OUR LIVES AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR OWN. JUST LIKE GENERATIONS THAT HAVE GONE BEFORE, YOU DID SO KNOWING THE SAILOR AND THE SOLDIER DO NOT BEAR THE SWORD IN VAIN. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE RISK YOU TAKE EVERY DAY. BUT KNOW THIS. YOU DO NOT BEAR THAT BURDEN ALONE. WHEREVER YOU ARE CALLED TO SERVE, WHEREVER YOU ARE DEPLOYED, I PROMISE YOU, YOU WILL CARRY WITH YOU THE STRENGTH AND PRIDE OF THIS NATION, AND THE PRAYERS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. THERE WILL PRAY IN THE ANCIENT WORDS OF THE PSALMISTS THAT NO HARM WILL BEFORE YOU, NO DISASTER WILL COME NEAR YOUR TENT, THAT AS YOU SERVE HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD, THAT HIS FAITHFULNESS WILL BE YOUR SHIELD. YOU ARE THE STRENGTH AND THE PRIDE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND A SOURCE OF GREAT PRIDE TO OUR FAMILY. AND WHETHER YOU SERVE ON LAND, AT SEA, OR IN THE SKIES ABOVE, JUST KNOW THAT EVERY DAY, IN HOMES LARGE AND SMALL AROUND DINNER TABLES AND GATHERINGS, AND IN QUIET MOMENTS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PRAY FOR EACH AND EVERYONE. GIVE THANKS FOR YOUR SELFLESS COURAGE, AND WISH YOU FARIR WINDS AND FOLLOWING SEAS. THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING WITH YOU TODAY. AS MY TIME IN OFFICE DRAWS TO A CLOSE, ALLOW ME TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT THESE PAST FOUR YEARS. IT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE. AND IT HAS BEEN A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE TO SERVE MEN AND WOMEN LIKE ALL OF YOU, MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES. I TRULY BELIEVE AS LONG AS WE HAVE MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU, WITH THE COURAGE AND SELFLESSNESS TO STEP FORWARD AND SERVE, AS LONG AS WE HAVE HEROES WILLING TO PUT YOUR LIVES ON THE LINE, AS LONG AS WE HAVE PATRIOTS WILLING TO DEFEND OUR NATION, I KNOW OUR COUNTRY WILL BE SAFE. OUR FREEDOM WILL BE SECURE, AND THE BEST DAYS FOR THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH ARE YET TO COME. SO MAY GOD BLESS THE MEN AND WOMEN OF NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE HERE AND DEPLOYED. GOD BLESS YOU AND HIS PROTECTION, AND WITH THAT FIGHTER SPIRIT. MAY GOD BLESS ALL THOSE SERVING IN OUR ARMED FORCES. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?508048-1/vice-president-pence-remarks-trump-administration-foreign-policy-achievements	Vice President Mike Pence spoke at Naval Air Station Lemoore in California to highlight foreign policy achievements of the Trump administration.

[APPLAUSE] AS I LOOK OUT AT ALL OF YOU GATHERED HERE, IT IS REMARKABLE TO THINK OF THE COUNTLESS AMERICAN HEROES WHO STOOD WHERE WE ARE HAS STANDING TODAY. WARRIORS WHO HAVE COME HERE AND TRAIN HERE, DEPLOYED FROM HERE TO VIRTUALLY EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD. SINCE 9/11, THE 10TH MOUNTAIN HAS BEEN THE MOST POLITE DIVISION OF THE U.S. ARMY , THE MOST DEPLOYED DIVISION OF THE U.S. ARMY, WITH THOUSANDS DEPLOYED EVERY DAY. THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION HAS SERVED A COMBINED 46 DEPLOYMENTS TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, THE FIRST CONVENTIONAL UNITS TO DEPLOYED TO AFGHANISTAN AFTER 9/11 CAME HERE , CAME FROM HERE AT FORT DRUM. OTHERS ARE DEPLOYED IN AFGHANISTAN AS WE SPEAK. AT THEY ARE LOOKING ON FROM AFAR, WE SAY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, WE ARE PROUD OF YOU ALL. [APPLAUSE] IT MAY BE TRUE IN THE DAYS AHEAD MEMBERS OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION COULD BE AMONG THE LAST CONVENTIONAL UNITS. SHOULD THE DAY COMES THAT THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN FINALLY COMES TO AN END. YOUR MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN HAS BEEN VITAL, TO THE SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS YEAR WILL MARK 20 YEARS SINCE THE FORCES OF RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR PLOTTED AND PERPETRATED THE DEADLIEST ATTACK ON THE AMERICAN HOMELAND IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. FROM THE SAFE HAVEN OF AFGHANISTAN, TERRORIST OF AL QAEDA STRUCK UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. I WAS A NEW MEMBER OF CONGRESS THEN, HAD JUST ARRIVED THAT YEAR, REPRESENTING INDIANA. I WILL NEVER FORGET WHERE I WAS, JUST OFF CAPITOL HILL, WHEN I HEARD THAT THAT THE TOWERS WERE STRUCK IN YORK CITY. FOR THE MOMENT WHEN I WALKED OUT OF THE OFFICE BUILDING, ACROSS FROM THE U.S. CAPITOL, AND SAW A CLEAR BLUE SKY OVER WASHINGTON, D.C. FILLED WITH BILLOWS OF MUD BROWN AND BLACK SMOKE, BILLOWING OUT OF THE PENTAGON. IT IS A SITE I WILL NEVER FORGET. , SIGHT THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET. LATER THAT DAY I WAS ABLE TO SLIP BACK ACROSS THE POTOMAC RIVER TO GO TO A LITTLE HOUSE KAREN AND I HAD RENTED WITHOUT CHILDREN, AS MICE , WITH OUR CHILDREN AS MY SERVICE BEGAN AND WASHINGTON, D.C. WHILE THERE WAS WORK TO BE DONE ON CAPITOL HILL, WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE GATHER WITH OUR KIDS, YOUNG CHILDREN AT THE TIME. WE SAT AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE TO TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED, AND TO REASSURE THEM. AND TO PRAY. I WILL NEVER FORGET THE MOMENT I WAS WALKING OUT OF THE KITCHEN. MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS SEVEN YEARS OF AGE, FOLLOW ME OUT THE DOOR. SHE SAID, DAD, I HAVE A QUESTION. I LOOKED AT HER AND SAID AUDREY, I HAVE TO GO AND I HAVE THINGS THAT I NEED TO DO. SHE SAID NO, DADDY, I HAVE A QUESTION. I SAID I REALLY HAVE TO GO. SHE STAMPED HER FEET. AND SAID DADDY, I HAVE A QUESTION. I LOOKED AT HER AND SAID, LIKE A SENSITIVE FATHER I WAS. WHAT? AND SHE LOOKED UP AT ME WITH THESE BIG BROWN EYES, SEVEN YEARS OF AGE, AND SHE SAID, DADDY, IF WE HAVE TO MAKE WAR, DO YOU HAVE TO GO? I DROPPED DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND THREW MY ARMS AROUND HER BECAUSE I SUDDENLY KNEW WHERE HER LITTLE HEART AND MIND WAS AT. I HUGGED HER AND TOLD HER DADDY IS TOO OLD. BUT I TELL THAT STORY BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A DATE GONE BY IN 20 YEARS THAT I HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF ALL OF YOU. WHO ANSWERED THAT QUESTION DIFFERENTLY. TO HER FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES , TO YOUR LOVED ONES. A GENERATION OF HEROES, YOU ALL ARE, WHO STEPPED FORWARD AND TOOK THE FIGHT TO OUR ENEMIES ON THEIR SOIL. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A DAY GONE BY THAT I AND EVERY AMERICAN HAS NOT BEEN GRATEFUL, TO THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION AND EVERY AMERICAN HERO IN UNIFORM. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU ALL. FROM THIS VERY FORT, SELFLESS PATRIOTS LIKE THOSE OF YOU GATHERED HERE TODAY, WHO STEPPED FORWARD AFTER THAT DAY, HAVE BEEN AT THE HEART OF THE WAR ON TERROR. IT IS BECAUSE OF YOU, IT IS BECAUSE OF YOU THAT WE REACHED THE 19TH ANNIVERSARY , ANNIVERSARY OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY JUST LAST YEAR, HAVING HAD NO MAJOR TERRORIST ATTACK ON AMERICAN SOIL SINCE. YOU TOOK THE FIGHT TO THE ENEMY IN THE FIELD, AND YOU HAVE GIVEN THE AFGHAN PEOPLE THE HOPE OF FREEDOM, A CHANCE TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN DESTINY, TO CHART A BETTER FUTURE. TODAY, AFGHANS ARE IN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS. I AM PROUD TO REPORT WITH GRATITUDE TO THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION, NOT A SINGLE AMERICAN COMBAT CASUALTY HAS OCCURRED IN AFGHANISTAN SINCE FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR. [APPLAUSE] OUR TROOPS HAVE BEEN COMING HOME. THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION DID ITS JOB AND I KNOW THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO DO JUST THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY. UNTIL THE LAST AMERICAN SOLDIER COMES HOME. MANY PEOPLE WONDER ALL THEIR LIVES IF THEY HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE. BUT YOU WILL NEVER HAVE THAT PROBLEM. THE TRUTH IS, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES ARE THE GREATEST FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND YOU CHOSE TO BE A PART OF THAT FORCE. YOU CHOSE TO DO YOUR PART IN OUR TIME, TO DEFEND FREEDOM, AND ENSURE THE SURVIVAL OF LIBERTY, IN THIS GENERATION AND IN THE NEXT. YOU KNOW, THE BIBLE SAYS, OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU, YOU DID NOT LOVE YOUR LIVES SO MUCH AS TO SHRINK FROM THIS CALLING, AND FOR THAT YOU HAVE THE RESPECT AND THE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AS EVIDENCE, FROM THE FIRST DAY OF OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE WORKED WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN BOTH PARTIES, TO MAKE THE STRONGEST FIGHTING FORCE IN HISTORY STRONGER STILL. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT BY DEVASTATING BUDGET CUT. S. OUR TROOPS HAD NOT SEEN A SIGNIFICANT PAY RATE RAISE IN NEARLY A DECADE. AND A LACK OF EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES. OUR NATO ALLIES WERE NOT MAKING , MEETING THE BASIC MINUTES THEY HAD MADE TO, DEFENSE. IN THE MIDDLE EAST, IRAN WAS RESURGENT. AND THAT TERRORIST ORGANIZATION ISIS CONTROL IN MS LARGER THAN PENNSYLVANIA. BUT UNDER , A LAND MASS LARGER THAN PENNSYLVANIA. BUT UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE ENACTED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. [APPLAUSE] WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR ALLIES IN CONGRESS, WE ARE ONCE AGAIN GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, COAST GUARD, AND GUARDIANS, THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THAT YOU NEED, TO ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION AND DEFEND THIS NATION. WE ALSO PROVIDED THE LARGEST PAY INCREASE IN THE LAST 10 YEARS AND YOU DESERVE EVERY PENNY. [APPLAUSE] LET ME SAY NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG SUPPORT OF LEADERS IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES. HERE AT FORT DRUM IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO TELL YOU NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG SUPPORT OF CONGRESSWOMAN ELISE STAFEANIK ON THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WHEN YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING HER FOR HER STRONG SUPPORT OF OUR ARMED FORCES. [APPLAUSE] PARAMILITARY , OUR MILITARY IS NOW BETTER EQUIPPED, BETTER SUPPLIED, BETTER TRAINED THAN EVER BEFORE. WE HAVE UPGRADED OUR TANKS, ARTILLERY, ROCKET SYSTEMS. WE BOLSTERED OUR FLEET OF ATTACK HELICOPTERS AND FIGHTER PLANES. WITH THAT STRONG COMMITMENT TO OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE AND A WILLINGNESS TO USE AMERICAN POWER, TO ADVANCE AMERICAN INTERESTS, AND OUR ALLIES HAVE STEPPED UP AS NEVER BEFORE. SINCE 2016, OUR NATO ALLIES HAVE INCREASED THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE BY $130 BILLION. [APPLAUSE] HISTORY TEACHES THAT WEAKNESS AROUSES PEOPLE. OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IF YOU WANT PEACE, YOU PREPARE FOR WAR. PEACE REQUIRES TWO THINGS, A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE, AND A WILLINGNESS TO ACT TO DEFEND AMERICA'S VITAL NATIONAL INTERESTS. I'M PROUD TO REPORT A FEW DAYS LEFT IN OUR ADMINISTRATION, OUR ADMINISTRATION IS THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION IN DECADES, THAT DID NOT GET AMERICA INTO A NEW WAR. THAT IS PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. [APPLAUSE] WITH THAT STRENGTH AND THE VALOR OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN, AND OUR ARMED FORCES AROUND THE WORLD, WE HAVE TAKEN THE FIGHT TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ON OUR TERMS ON THEIR SOIL. A YEAR AGO, OUR ARMED FORCES CAPTURED LAST INCH OF TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY ISIS AND THE 10TH MOUNTAIN WAS IN THE FIGHT FROM EARLY ON. U.S. FORCES CRUSHED CALIPHATE AND TOOK DOWN THEIR LEADER WITHOUT ONE AMERICAN CASUALTY. DURING THE PAST FOUR YEARS, WE HAVE STOOD UP TO THE LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR AS WELL, WITHDRAWING FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. WE STRENGTHENED OUR ALLIANCES IN THE REGION AND ISOLATED IRAN AS NEVER BEFORE. WHEN THE MOST DANGEROUS TERRORISTS ON THE PLANET THREATEN TO DO HARM TO AMERICAN FORCES, WE ACTED. AND IRAN'S TOP GENERAL, KASEM SULEIMANI, IS GONE. THANKS TO AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AND THE COURAGE AND VALOR OF OUR ARMED FORCES, A MORE PEACEFUL MIDDLE EAST IS WITHIN OUR SITES. PEACE NEGOTIATIONS RESUMED THIS MONTH IN DOHA, QATAR, BETWEEN THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND THE TALIBAN. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 26 YEARS, FOR ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST. [APPLAUSE] SO, WHETHER IT BE IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR OR MANNING THE RAMPARTS OF FREEDOM IN EUROPE, MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY HAVE BEEN AT THE TIP OF THE SPEAR. AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE. YOUR READINESS, STAYING ARMY STRONG, IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN PARTICULAR WILL BE THE VANGUARD IN THE YEARS AHEAD, TO ENSURE THAT NO NATION WILL EVER AGAIN BECOME A SAFE HAVEN FOR PEOPLE THAT COULD THREATEN OUR PEOPLE OR THE WIDER WORLD. WE ARE ALL COUNTING ON YOU, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE CAN. ON BEHALF OF YOUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF LET ME OFFER YOU THIS ADMONITION. IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES ACROSS THE WIDER WORLD, BE VIGILANT. MIND YOUR MISSION. RESPECT THE UNIFIED CHAIN OF COMMAND, KEEP TAKING CARE OF EACH OTHER, AND NEVER DOUBT THAT EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE MATTERS TO THE DEFENSE OF OUR NATION, AND ARE VITAL NATIONAL INTERESTS ABROAD. GIVE AMERICA YOUR BEST EVERY DAY. IN THE VERY BEST TRADITION OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION. AND AS YOU STAY ON YOUR POST, I WANT YOU TO NOTE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BEHIND YOU 100%. YOU KNOW, I AM ALWAYS HUMBLED TO STAND BEFORE MEN AND WOMEN LIKE ALL OF YOU. BECAUSE, WHILE MY DAD WAS A COMBAT VETERAN, U.S. ARMY. [APPLAUSE] HE SAW ACTION IN THE KOREAN WAR. AND WHILE OUR SON AND SON-IN-LAW ARE SERVING IN THE MILITARY TODAY, MY LIFE DID NOT TAKE ME INTO THE UNIFORM OF THE UNITED STATES. SO IT IS DEEPLY HUMBLING, TO STAND BEFORE PEOPLE LIKE YOU. BUT MAYBE IT IS ALTOGETHER FITTING THAT YOU HEAR FROM AN AMERICAN LIKE ME, NOT SO MUCH AS HER VICE PRESIDENT, , NOT SO MUCH AS YOU'RE VICE PRESIDENT, BUT AS A GRATEFUL CITIZEN, TO SAY THE WORDS THAT YOU SHOULD HERE NOW AND FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION HERE AT FORT DRUM, I ASSURE YOU, YOU ARE THE STRENGTH AND THE PRIDE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AMERICA IS THE FREEST AND STRONGEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND YOU SECURE THAT FREEDOM. AND YOU ARE THAT STRENGTH. YOU STEP FORWARD IN A CALLING WHERE YOU DECIDED TO COUNT OUR LIVES AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR OWN. JUST LIKE THOSE IN GENERATIONS THAT HAVE GONE BEFORE, THE DATE YOU STEPPED FORWARD, YOU KNEW, THAT THE SOLDIER DOES NOT BEAR THE SWORD IN VAIN. SO, AS I THINK ALL OF YOU HERE, AND ALL OF THOSE MEMBERS OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DEPLOYED OVERSEAS AT THIS HOUR, LET ME SAY TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU, OUR NATION WILL NEVER FORGET, OR FAIL TO HONOR, THOSE IN THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION WHO GAVE THEIR LAST FULL MEASURE OF DEVOTION. I PROMISE YOU THAT. AND I WANT TO ENSURE IT , AND I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE RISK YOU SHOULDER EVERY DAY. KNOW THIS. YOU DO NOT BEAR THAT BURDEN ALONE. WHEREVER YOU ARE CALLED TO SERVE, WHEREVER YOU ARE DEPLOYED, I PROMISE YOU, YOU WILL CARRY WITH YOU THE STRENGTH AND PRIDE OF THIS NATION. AND YOU WILL CARRY WITH YOU THE PRAYERS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. EVERY DAY, IN HOMES ACROSS THE LAND, AND ON THE FARM, AROUND DINNER TABLES, AND PLACES OF WORSHIP, OR JUST IN QUIET MOMENTS, I KNOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE PRAYING FOR YOU, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. IN THE WORDS OF THE PSALMISTS, THAT NO HOME , NO HARM WOULD BEFALL YOU, NO DISASTER WILL COME NEAR YOUR TENT, AND AS YOU SERVE, HIS FAITHFULNESS WOULD BE YOUR SHIELD AND YOUR RAMPART. SO, THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING WITH YOU TODAY. AND AS OUR TIME IN OFFICE DRAWS TO A CLOSE, ALLOW ME TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS YOU'RE VICE PRESIDENT. IT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE. AND IT HAS BEEN A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE TO SERVE ALL OF YOU, AND MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU, WHO HAVE BEEN ALL OF THIS COUNTRY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD, WEARING THE UNIFORM OF THE ARMED FORCES, OF THE UNITED STATES. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE HAVE ALL BEEN THROUGH A LOT THIS PAST YEAR. BUT THROUGH IT ALL, I HAVE SEEN THE STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FORTH. AND I SEE THAT STRENGTH IN YOUR FACES TODAY. LOOKING OUT AT ALL OF YOU, AND REMEMBERING THE COUNTLESS HEROES WE HAVE MET ALONG THE WAY THESE PAST FOUR YEARS, AND REMEMBERING THE GRACE OF HIM THAT HAS EVER GUIDED THE DESTINY OF THIS NATION, I HAVE FAITH, THAT THE DAY WILL COME, WHEN WE PUT THESE CHALLENGING TIMES IN THE PAST, AND EMERGE STRONGER AND BETTER THAN EVER. WE WILL HEAL OUR LAND. WE WILL RENEW OUR STRENGTH. AND THE BEST DAYS FOR THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH ARE YET TO COME. IN THIS ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] SO, GOD BLESS THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN HERE AND IT DEPLOYED WITH HIS PROTECTION AS YOU CLIMB FOR GLORY. GOD BLESS ALL THOSE IN THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES. AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.

CONGRESSWOMAN ELISE STAFANIK, GENERAL, ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES GATHERED HERE, U.S. ARMY STRONG. THANKS FOR THE WARM WELCOME. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK AT THE BACKBONE OF U.S. ARMY READINESS, THE HOME OF MOUNTAIN TOUGH. THE SOLDIERS OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION. FOR MORE THAN 100 YEARS, THE NORTH COUNTRY HAS BEEN A TRAINING GROUND FOR AMERICA SOLDIERS. TODAY THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION TRAIN HERE AND DEPLOY HERE AND CLIMBED TO GLORY. SO GIVE YOURSELVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. AMERICA'S PROUD OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN. WHILE YOU ARE AT IT, WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN SHOWING YOUR APPRECIATION FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN SO DEDICATED THESE LAST FOUR YEARS TO MILITARY FAMILIES AND SPOUSES, LITERALLY TRAVELED THE WORLD, ENCOURAGING THOSE WHO STAND ALONGSIDE ALL OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE. AS YOU JUST HEARD, SHE IS A MARINE CORPS MOM. MY WIFE OF 35 YEARS, THE BEST SECOND LADY THE UNITED STATES HAS EVER HAD. WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING KAREN PENCE, FOR ALL THAT SHE HAS DONE FOR AMERICA THESE LAST FOUR YEARS? SO PROUD OF HER. ISN'T SHE GREAT? YOU KNOW, I AM HERE TO DELIVER A SIMPLE MESSAGE. TO EACH AND EVERYONE ONE OF YOU. ON BEHALF OF YOUR COMMANDER AND CHIEF AND EVERY AMERICAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AND TO THE FIRST BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM, WELCOME HOME. AFTER TRAVELING THIS COUNTRY THE PAST FOUR YEARS, I CAN ASSURE ALL OF YOU IN UNIFORM, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE MORE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE THEN YOU WILL EVER KNOW. I HEAR ABOUT AT ALL THE TIME. YOU COME FROM THE REST OF US. THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY KNOW, YOU'RE THE BEST OF US. WE ARE GRATEFUL. NOT ONLY TO THOSE OF YOU WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM, BUT WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THOSE WHO SERVE ALONGSIDE. SO MANY OF YOU SERVE EVERY DAY AS A FAMILY WHILE YOU TRAIN, WHY YOU DEPLOY. IT IS OUR WIVES, YOUR HUSBANDS, AND THE PARENT TO KEEP THE HOME FIRES BURNING. AS YOU JUST HEARD, FROM MY WIFE, KAREN, WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WE HAVE TWO MARRIED ACTIVE-DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL IN OUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY, AND WE COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD. SO WHY DON'T WE GIVE A ROUSING ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO THE 10TH, WHY DON'T YOU GET ON YOUR FEET TO SHOW HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE ALL OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO STAND BY YOU TO SERVE. LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE HOUSES, AND KIDS, AND PARENTS, WHO MAKE IT ALL WORK. AS I LOOK OUT AT ALL OF YOU GATHERED HERE, IT IS REMARKABLE TO THINK OF THE COUNTLESS AMERICAN HEROES WHO STOOD WHERE WE ARE HAS STANDING TODAY. WARRIORS WHO HAVE COME HERE AND TRAIN HERE, DEPLOYED FROM HERE TO VIRTUALLY EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD. SINCE 9/11, THE 10TH MOUNTAIN HAS BEEN THE MOST POLITE DIVISION OF THE U.S. ARMY , THE MOST DEPLOYED DIVISION OF THE U.S. ARMY, WITH THOUSANDS DEPLOYED EVERY DAY. THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION HAS SERVED A COMBINED 46 DEPLOYMENTS TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, THE FIRST CONVENTIONAL UNITS TO DEPLOYED TO AFGHANISTAN AFTER 9/11 CAME HERE , CAME FROM HERE AT FORT DRUM. OTHERS ARE DEPLOYED IN AFGHANISTAN AS WE SPEAK. AT THEY ARE LOOKING ON FROM AFAR, WE SAY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, WE ARE PROUD OF YOU ALL. IT MAY BE TRUE IN THE DAYS AHEAD MEMBERS OF THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION COULD BE AMONG THE LAST CONVENTIONAL UNITS. SHOULD THE DAY COMES THAT THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN FINALLY COMES TO AN END. YOUR MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN HAS BEEN VITAL, TO THE SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS YEAR WILL MARK 20 YEARS SINCE THE FORCES OF RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR PLOTTED AND PERPETRATED THE DEADLIEST ATTACK ON THE AMERICAN HOMELAND IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. FROM THE SAFE HAVEN OF AFGHANISTAN, TERRORIST OF AL QAEDA STRUCK UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. I WAS A NEW MEMBER OF CONGRESS THEN, HAD JUST ARRIVED THAT YEAR, REPRESENTING INDIANA. I WILL NEVER FORGET WHERE I WAS, JUST OFF CAPITOL HILL, WHEN I HEARD THAT THAT THE TOWERS WERE STRUCK IN YORK CITY. FOR THE MOMENT WHEN I WALKED OUT OF THE OFFICE BUILDING, ACROSS FROM THE U.S. CAPITOL, AND SAW A CLEAR BLUE SKY OVER WASHINGTON, D.C. FILLED WITH BILLOWS OF MUD BROWN AND BLACK SMOKE, BILLOWING OUT OF THE PENTAGON. IT IS A SITE I WILL NEVER FORGET. , SIGHT THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET. LATER THAT DAY I WAS ABLE TO SLIP BACK ACROSS THE POTOMAC RIVER TO GO TO A LITTLE HOUSE KAREN AND I HAD RENTED WITHOUT CHILDREN, AS MICE , WITH OUR CHILDREN AS MY SERVICE BEGAN AND WASHINGTON, D.C. WHILE THERE WAS WORK TO BE DONE ON CAPITOL HILL, WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE GATHER WITH OUR KIDS, YOUNG CHILDREN AT THE TIME. WE SAT AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE TO TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED, AND TO REASSURE THEM. AND TO PRAY. I WILL NEVER FORGET THE MOMENT I WAS WALKING OUT OF THE KITCHEN. MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS SEVEN YEARS OF AGE, FOLLOW ME OUT THE DOOR. SHE SAID, DAD, I HAVE A QUESTION. I LOOKED AT HER AND SAID AUDREY, I HAVE TO GO AND I HAVE THINGS THAT I NEED TO DO. SHE SAID NO, DADDY, I HAVE A QUESTION. I SAID I REALLY HAVE TO GO. SHE STAMPED HER FEET. AND SAID DADDY, I HAVE A QUESTION. I LOOKED AT HER AND SAID, LIKE A SENSITIVE FATHER I WAS. WHAT? AND SHE LOOKED UP AT ME WITH THESE BIG BROWN EYES, SEVEN YEARS OF AGE, AND SHE SAID, DADDY, IF WE HAVE TO MAKE WAR, DO YOU HAVE TO GO? I DROPPED DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND THREW MY ARMS AROUND HER BECAUSE I SUDDENLY KNEW WHERE HER LITTLE HEART AND MIND WAS AT. I HUGGED HER AND TOLD HER DADDY IS TOO OLD. BUT I TELL THAT STORY BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A DATE GONE BY IN 20 YEARS THAT I HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF ALL OF YOU. WHO ANSWERED THAT QUESTION DIFFERENTLY. TO HER FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES , TO YOUR LOVED ONES. A GENERATION OF HEROES, YOU ALL ARE, WHO STEPPED FORWARD AND TOOK THE FIGHT TO OUR ENEMIES ON THEIR SOIL. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A DAY GONE BY THAT I AND EVERY AMERICAN HAS NOT BEEN GRATEFUL, TO THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION AND EVERY AMERICAN HERO IN UNIFORM. THANK YOU ALL. FROM THIS VERY FORT, SELFLESS PATRIOTS LIKE THOSE OF YOU GATHERED HERE TODAY, WHO STEPPED FORWARD AFTER THAT DAY, HAVE BEEN AT THE HEART OF THE WAR ON TERROR. IT IS BECAUSE OF YOU, IT IS BECAUSE OF YOU THAT WE REACHED THE 19TH ANNIVERSARY , ANNIVERSARY OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY JUST LAST YEAR, HAVING HAD NO MAJOR TERRORIST ATTACK ON AMERICAN SOIL SINCE. YOU TOOK THE FIGHT TO THE ENEMY IN THE FIELD, AND YOU HAVE GIVEN THE AFGHAN PEOPLE THE HOPE OF FREEDOM, A CHANCE TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN DESTINY, TO CHART A BETTER FUTURE. TODAY, AFGHANS ARE IN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS. I AM PROUD TO REPORT WITH GRATITUDE TO THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION, NOT A SINGLE AMERICAN COMBAT CASUALTY HAS OCCURRED IN AFGHANISTAN SINCE FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR. OUR TROOPS HAVE BEEN COMING HOME. THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION DID ITS JOB AND I KNOW THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO DO JUST THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY. UNTIL THE LAST AMERICAN SOLDIER COMES HOME. MANY PEOPLE WONDER ALL THEIR LIVES IF THEY HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE. BUT YOU WILL NEVER HAVE THAT PROBLEM. THE TRUTH IS, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES ARE THE GREATEST FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND YOU CHOSE TO BE A PART OF THAT FORCE. YOU CHOSE TO DO YOUR PART IN OUR TIME, TO DEFEND FREEDOM, AND ENSURE THE SURVIVAL OF LIBERTY, IN THIS GENERATION AND IN THE NEXT. YOU KNOW, THE BIBLE SAYS, OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU, YOU DID NOT LOVE YOUR LIVES SO MUCH AS TO SHRINK FROM THIS CALLING, AND FOR THAT YOU HAVE THE RESPECT AND THE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AS EVIDENCE, FROM THE FIRST DAY OF OUR ADMINISTRATION, WE HAVE WORKED WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN BOTH PARTIES, TO MAKE THE STRONGEST FIGHTING FORCE IN HISTORY STRONGER STILL. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE INHERITED A MILITARY THAT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT BY DEVASTATING BUDGET CUT. S. OUR TROOPS HAD NOT SEEN A SIGNIFICANT PAY RATE RAISE IN NEARLY A DECADE. AND A LACK OF EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES. OUR NATO ALLIES WERE NOT MAKING , MEETING THE BASIC MINUTES THEY HAD MADE TO, DEFENSE. IN THE MIDDLE EAST, IRAN WAS RESURGENT. AND THAT TERRORIST ORGANIZATION ISIS CONTROL IN MS LARGER THAN PENNSYLVANIA. BUT UNDER , A LAND MASS LARGER THAN PENNSYLVANIA. BUT UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE HAVE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE ENACTED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN. WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR ALLIES IN CONGRESS, WE ARE ONCE AGAIN GIVING OUR SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, COAST GUARD, AND GUARDIANS, THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THAT YOU NEED, TO ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION AND DEFEND THIS NATION. WE ALSO PROVIDED THE LARGEST PAY INCREASE IN THE LAST 10 YEARS AND YOU DESERVE EVERY PENNY. LET ME SAY NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG SUPPORT OF LEADERS IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES. HERE AT FORT DRUM IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO TELL YOU NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRONG SUPPORT OF CONGRESSWOMAN ELISE STAFEANIK ON THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WHEN YOU JOIN ME IN THANKING HER FOR HER STRONG SUPPORT OF OUR ARMED FORCES. PARAMILITARY , OUR MILITARY IS NOW BETTER EQUIPPED, BETTER SUPPLIED, BETTER TRAINED THAN EVER BEFORE. WE HAVE UPGRADED OUR TANKS, ARTILLERY, ROCKET SYSTEMS. WE BOLSTERED OUR FLEET OF ATTACK HELICOPTERS AND FIGHTER PLANES. WITH THAT STRONG COMMITMENT TO OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE AND A WILLINGNESS TO USE AMERICAN POWER, TO ADVANCE AMERICAN INTERESTS, AND OUR ALLIES HAVE STEPPED UP AS NEVER BEFORE. SINCE 2016, OUR NATO ALLIES HAVE INCREASED THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COMMON DEFENSE BY $130 BILLION. HISTORY TEACHES THAT WEAKNESS AROUSES PEOPLE.
