I loved how [NAME] feels like everyone in the office is her family. Her relationship with [NAME] is so cute and innocent,1
Then I’m sorry but this game really isn’t for you. Progression like that would ruin the base of what this game is.,-1

"[NAME] has always favoured [NAME] so I'd assume this means he's the next up, I just prefer [NAME] and find [NAME] a little overrated.",-1
It’s the format. It’s like one of those bad [NAME] memes,-1
"Yes, at home recuperating from a fractured ankle. ",-1

Cant wait to hear a hot take from the second dumbest people who ever loved ([NAME] ots the first if you are asking),1
Because [NAME] had a foot injury that I think he sustained at practice for the second half of the year.,1

Got it! Thank you!,1

"The possibilities are fascinating. In other times, I'd be enjoying watching the lawyers argue...!",1
"I found that after particularly bad games I feel the “need” to smoke more weed, like a cigarette after a carcrash IMO",1
I don’t think they really thought through the ramifications of putting a bunch of angry women through rigorous physical exercise with weapons. That uprising would be glorious!,1

Terrifyingly accurate bot,1
If you're in the Bay Area check out Flying Over Walls.,1

Opposing ethnonationalism and private property is hardly a weird hill for an anarchism to defend,1
Well they called and said there was a pricing discrepancy and they could not honor it. 😭 sad day.,-1

They all have these same moronic talking points that they memorized. It's hilarious. I hear them all the time,1

I'm so fucking dead!!!!!!!💀💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣,-1
“Stop. What are you doing? Stop.” 😂,1
I give 90 percent odds that [NAME] will be reelected. And I think it will be at a much higher margin than 2016.,1
Wow I bet someone would look at this and get inspired to make a movie about aliens with [NAME],1

That almost makes her seem like an actual human being.,-1
"Don’t know why I didn’t think of that..but hey thanks, hero!",1

I like hearing about these positive encounters.,1
I like seeing this. There is hope. I want to hug this guy. He'll be allright.,1
Lets just say its probably cheaper to just hope a more positive outlook reflects on your out-look.,1
He told you that he hates your friends because they don't beat you up? That is so disgusting!,-1
Are you top or bottom? I need to go under you real quick I'm gonna need you to take him on bar,1
Maybe [NAME] needs to have a Big Mac meal and relax.,1

Id buy those shoes and walk in the dirtiest places just to piss [NAME] off.,-1
Self-deprecating humor is mainstream now. A lot of hot people now have hobbies and personality traits that were once almost synonymous with dumpy/nerdy/ugly people.,-1
You should have noped out of the whole thing the moment the racist with a racist character came into the picture.,-1
That is a great video,1

[NAME] is such a wholesome woman. The world needs more people like her.,1
Black people still get shot unarmed. Comparing suffering is stupid and pointless.,-1

Agree completely with this statement,1
Don't eat the [NAME] family. You shouldn't eat trash.,1
And he’s been with same org with his former teammates before Vegas. That and highly doubt [NAME] would drop a loyal player.,1
"Season 3 onward, pretty much anything with [NAME] makes me laugh. My fav character for sure. ",1
"Thanks. Though tbh I think some 3D characters, [NAME] etc could fit in. Though they might be some unlockable characters hidden maybe. ",1
Such grace.,1
"...except it really IS ""maybe next year.""",1
Really wish we had got something like this!,1
> lots of ppl dont enjoy pvp I feel like these people are playing the wrong game genres lol.,-1
Shhhh it's ok,1
Yeah you better hope. I just switched to combat pro from standard and I gotta say my builds are 🗿,1
Absolutely. It takes me back to a much happier time. When I die I hope I go to San Junipero.,1

You’re not being clear in what you’re trying to say. I’m unsure how to try to help you in this case.,1
"Ya missed a clue there, Guess it never hit ya!",-1
It's bizarre that it's considered normal to intentionally brainwash people into murdering psychos.,-1
It's all hypocrisy and projection. The people smearing him work for [NAME] and [NAME].,-1
Good luck my tw broskies :(,1

The lunatic is on the grass.,-1
"You're analogies are terrible and prove the opposite of what you were arguing, numb skull 😂",-1
