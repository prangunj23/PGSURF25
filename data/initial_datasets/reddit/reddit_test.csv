First is the worst,-1
Our education system has been a complete and utter failure...,-1
"The fuck you call me!? A cunt!? Damn man, didn’t know I meant so much to you, right in the feels.",-1
It will probably take him some time to figure out whether he’s really ok with it or not.,1
Somebody is really insecure about their career decisions.,-1
I just saw that they deleted their account. Good.,1
You can only fit so much in 20ish min show.,1
Thanks for looking out but we will take our chances with this grave danger.,1
"I feel like I already knew, I just needed to have someone else tell me to really open up my eyes. Thank you for your comment",1
Let's get things back on track! Happy new year!,1
"Ah the classic ""I don't deserve you"" argument.",1
"Childhood is happiness. After that the rest of your life is spent chasing that feeling, a feeling that you’ll never experience again ",-1
Hey thanks! Happy new year to you too!,1
Haha fucking gottem,1
"Hi, [NAME]! I am stopping by to wish you the best day, and the best year! -HappyFriendlyBot",1
Haha Nice. I finished paying [NAME] back about a year ago. Great feeling! Congrats.,1
Borrowed time is stupid,-1
You're a mean person.,-1

Lol I lol'd *I too am down with the kids. But not like that because that would be illegal*,1
Ah the good old Russian Right Hook.,1
Reports of a small fire or a transformer that blew. Nothing that I’ve seen has confirmed either though.,1
Glad those underprivileged West Loop kids will finally have something nice to take advantage of.,1
I wish everything the I was going through was a hallucination,1
"That was a brutal shift. Honestly he should be playing sheltered minutes. Team needs [NAME] and [NAME] back, give bulk of his minutes to [NAME]. ",-1
The Nashville Design is just a placeholder. The actual plans have yet to been finalized.,1
"This is the worst Hellraiser reboot script I've read this month, and let me tell you, I've read a lot of them.",-1
"Meh, same branch of religion. Just opposing views on the sequel to the story.",-1
People like you are why I follow this sub. Keep it up I need more laughs like that!,1
No one does... that what makes it so provocative.,-1
I like this one,1
"If you have schools in your city, I got bad news for ya champ...",-1
annoyed at most,-1
"Yes, we are going to kink shame you. ",-1
I would say love is never enough. Love is unconditional. Relationships are not.,1
Helps quite a bit when the opponent forfeits the game by playing a high school QB. This is [NAME] in the playoffs bad.,1
Man. Just tuned in. Forgot it was an early game. Looks like it's been a positive game so far from pretty much everyone.,1
glad you made the trip from a fellow austinite,1
I'm happy I live in a country where machete attacks don't have to be a real concern.,1
I thought I was the only knicks/browns fan on this sub! That's cool. But yeah I love hearing him and clyde do broadcasts,1
"I was just trying to work around the ""no rude"" rule. I like a challenge ;-)",1
I’m just gonna go ahead and call bullshit on most of the details of this story.,-1
That tiny shoulder pad is freaking adorable.,1
"Haven't played in forever, but [NAME] solo was my jam back in the day. Glad to hear damage tanks are still good",1
"ok thanks alot :), just extremely weird VAC bans are less harsh than throwing for Skins. lol",1
"Yeah you’re right, I’m not fit for the position! Thank you for giving me the right words to say. ",1
And then he calls the fans crybabies for saying his movie sucked. Just take the L dude.,-1
"I never understood the part where he dives into a pile of money, even as a child. It seems wildly painful.",-1
I'm disappointed in you too.,-1
I get needing a good education but what is with people acting like spending the most per student is a badge of honor?,1
"Everyone hates guys that talk shit and can't back it up, don't start shit when you suck.",-1
The essay is optional.,1
Being physically attractive 😒,1
That was a beautiful shirt,1
There is no greater form of oppression than being called a bigot. #debateme #babyhitler #otherpeoplesbabies,1
Thanks a lot,1
Wow [NAME] is back I hope to see better pain defense when the second unit is out there.,1
Jokes are even more terrible lately,-1
lol why would we leave the PL’s top scorer on the bench,1
Fuck your opinion apparently,-1
Don’t get your hopes up for new armour,-1
"Not literally sell, but trying to ""sell the experience."" All you'd do is just walk around a cemetery lol.",1
"It's a bit of a saying from [NAME]. What I like to also say is love the person, hate the behaviour",1
"Wow, that's awesome you heard that in the wild.",1
Peace to you both.,1
I love [NAME].,1
I have vision issues already and I kind of freak out without sound. I'm gonna have to say blind.,-1
so doing something illegal only dehumanises you when caught?,-1
I didn't say it was soulless.,-1
Ouh shittt my dad is also going to be surprised,-1
"It's the ""boyfriend around school haha jk"" thing that makes it weird.",1
"It won't, it will stop the ones who cross the border. Not a very hard concept. ",1
"Cheers, I have some cheese left in the fridge that I can use here, thanks for the info.",1
"I believe they know about it and don’t care, but they aren’t paying someone that doesn’t work there to do it.",-1
Bless you!,1
"You don't need to screw your face up like that, it's already screwed up enough.",-1
No I think he just meant that losing half of your shit should at least move the needle a little lol,-1
He’s legally blind... medical marijuana is a thing bro... got any on ya?,1
You sound like my gf. I'm so lucky to have her in my life.,1
"Well I am a lady, so that would probably just freak them out. Oh, Reddit. Everyone is a man haha. ",1
I dont want to live in this world no more,-1
"Join Wattpad! There are many great books and it's free :) If you want ""real"" books, [NAME] is definitely worth reading. ",1
Her meal looks pretty good...,1
A UBI has to be sustainable. Taxing something to reduce its use and funneling that money into something people would depend on is absolute stupidity.,-1
No....no its not. Anyways thanks for being honest. I needed to hear it from someone else.,1
Misogynist! Anti-women! Bigot!,-1
[NAME] that was funny too. She was mothering him the whole episode,1

"The snapchat news feed on the stories page is horrendous, its entirely just celebs, porn and hookup culture shit. ",-1

You [NAME] did not make us look good at all.,-1
Im kinda hoping some woman flips the coin and posts how secretly poking holes in condoms with sewing needles to get pregnant was the best decision of her life.,1
And everyone will cheer for [NAME],1
100% this is enough to make me want to watch,1
Stop using your corporate jargon around here!,-1
I can’t translate /s to Texan speak well and forgot so my apologies y’all :),-1
I like His And Hers Poker Podcast,1
Maybe 2 years ago the time wasn't right for your relationship and now it is. It's been long enough to give it a second chance imo.,-1

Keep voting against your own interests. #maga!,1
I would love to see [NAME] take on the Avengers and win.,1
"Yeah, I mentioned some of that elsewhere in this thread.",1
Ah. Okay. Good luck with work tomorrow.,1
You can still joke but people will react negatively and will cause consequences,1
not at all. Hong kong streets and roads are super narrow. I get claustrophobic there.,-1
I'm so glad my dog hasn't figured out how to jump the 6' fence.,1
i’m so glad you’re doing good now! have a great new year and keep pushing on my guy!,1
What a sheltered life you have lived.,1
The only one I'd recomend is [NAME] to be honest,1
What's the fucking point of this post? Is just baseless claims with no proof to back them up.,-1
"Dude! Coyotes are no joke. Good job, [NAME]. ",1
That what a highlight reel moment that will be played for years and years. That game is on my rotation of games. Great game all around.,1
"And then you're stuck on that medication for life, sounds like a scary trade-off.",-1

I cringe every time [NAME] is in a fast break because it usually ends with his shot getting spiked lol.,1
This is actually kinda funny,1
"Yes, all the time when I can tell somebody is upset with me. Allistic peeps really refuse to communicate clearly it’s the worst!",-1
I didn’t know it was gonna be that simple Forgive me [NAME] :D,-1
I wish that laugh would jump off,-1
"Having read the entire article, and some of the other FAQ, the only thing this is telling is that [NAME] read the same book very differently.",1
its even worse because the starter kit is like $70 too right? So in reality she probably made closer to $30,-1
It's just bizarre you would criticize [NAME] on his development capabilities when he's not a developer... His specialties are centered around crypto philosophy,1
EWWW yes. This makes me shudder. All wet and gross.,-1
This is why I love Reddit.,1

Me too I hope all goes well for both of us,1
"Crash is probably my favorite specialist in this game, you get extra ammo, extra points and occasionally 50hp more from tak-5.",1
I like the hints of purple,1
You're right. I read that tweet and I think it dislodged from my brain because it just assumed nobody would argue something that utterly stupid.,1
"This is true, but he's perceived as white by most liberals. ",1
She’s trying to motivate him to have a normal life after prison. She’s just not doing it the right way.,-1

Survival of the toughest.,-1
Whoa I actually remember this. Wait shit does that mean I’m old,-1

Sounds like my kind of place.,1
It would be faster then light travel,1
I like her too! I hope she does well and stays away from [NAME].,1
Yeah that's what I meant but I wrote it stupidly. Did you start with really low weight? Like really low?,-1
Did you just say suck a fuck?,-1
I’m a millennial and my mortgage payment only takes about 1/5 of my after tax earnings in a month. Feels so good.,1
